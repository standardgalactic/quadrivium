Preface 
 
 
 
Calculation and design of electrical machines and drives remain challenging 
tasks. However, this becomes even more and more important as there are increas-
ing numbers of applications being equipped with electrical machines. Some recent 
examples well-known to the public are wind energy generators and electrical trac-
tion drives in the automotive industry. To realize optimal solutions for electrical 
drive systems it is necessary not only to know some basic equations for machine 
calculation, but also to deeply understand the principles and limitations of electri-
cal machines and drives. 
To foster the know-how in this technical field, this book Electrical Machines 
starts with some basic considerations to introduce the reader to electromagnetic 
circuit calculation. This is followed by the description of the steady-state operation 
of the most important machine topologies and afterwards by the dynamic opera-
tion and control methods. Continuously giving detailed mathematical deductions 
to all topics guarantees an optimal understanding of the underlying principles. 
Therefore, this book contributes to a comprehensive expert knowledge in electri-
cal machines and drives. Consequently, it will be very useful for academia as well 
as for industry by supporting senior students and engineers in conceiving and de-
signing electrical machines and drives. 
After introducing Maxwell’s equations and some principles of electromagnetic 
circuit calculation, the first part of the book is dedicated to the steady-state opera-
tion of electrical machines. The detailed description of the brushed DC-machine is 
followed by the rotating field theory, which in particular explains in detail the 
winding factors and harmonics of the magneto-motive force of distributed wind-
ings. On this basis, induction machines and synchronous machines are described. 
This first part of the book is completed by regarding permanent magnet machines, 
switched reluctance machines, and small machines for single-phase use. 
Dynamic operation and control of electrical machines are the topics of the sec-
ond part of this book, starting with some fundamental considerations. Next, the 
dynamic operation of brushed DC-machines and their control is described (in par-
ticular cascaded control using PI-controllers and their adjustment rules). A very 
important concept for calculating the dynamic operation of rotating field machines 
is the space vector theory; this is deduced and explained in detail in the following 
chapter. Then, the dynamic behavior of induction machines and synchronous ma-
chines follows, including the description of important control methods like field-
v

 
oriented control (FOC) and direct torque control (DTC). The permanent magnet 
machine with surface mounted magnets (SPM) or interior magnets (IPM) is ex-
plained concerning the differences of both in torque control and concerning the 
maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control method. The last chapter gives an 
overview of latest research results concerning concentrated windings. 
In spite of being a new contribution to a comprehensive understanding of elec-
trical machines and the respective actual developments the reader may find parts 
of the contents even in different literature, as this book explains the fundamentals 
of electrical machines (steady-state and dynamic operation as well as control). 
Concerning these fundamentals it is nearly impossible to list all relevant literature 
during the text layout. Therefore, the most important references are given at the 
end of each chapter. In addition, parts of the lectures of Prof. H. Bausch (Universi-
taet der Bundeswehr Munich, Germany) and Prof. G. Henneberger (RWTH Aa-
chen, Germany) were used as a basis. 
The author deeply wishes to express his grateful acknowledgment to all team 
members of his Chair of Electrical Drives and Actuators at the Universitaet der 
Bundeswehr Munich and of the spin-off company FEAAM GmbH for their most 
valuable discussions and support. In particular this holds for (in alphabetical or-
der) Dr.-Ing. Gurakuq Dajaku, Mrs. Lara Kauke, and most notably Dr.-Ing. Hans-
Joachim Koebler. Without their beneficial contributions this book would not have 
been possible in such a high quality.  
Last, but not least the author exceedingly thanks his wife and his daughters for 
their respectfulness and understanding not only concerning the effort being ac-
companied by writing this book, but even concerning the expenditure of time the 
author dedicates to professional activities.

μ  
the scalar field of the permeability (in vacuum or air there is: 
0
μ = μ ); 
ε  
the scalar field of the dielectric constant (in vacuum or air there is:

ε = ε ); 
γ  
the scalar field of the electric conductivity. 
 
The expression “vector field” means that the vector quantity depends on all 
(usually three) geometric coordinates; the expression “scalar field” means that sca-

The reason for the total electric field penetrating a closed surface of any vol-
ume are the electric charges inside this volume. 
1.1.2.6 Examples for the Ampere’s Law (First Maxwell’s Equation in Integral 
Form) 
The Ampere’s Law is an integral law. It shows the dependency of the magneto-
motive force (ampere-turns) and the magnetic circulation voltage, but in general it 
cannot be used to calculate the magnetic field strength. For the calculation of the 
magnetic field strength H
G
 at given magneto-motive force additional knowledge of 
the field is necessary (e.g. symmetry characteristics or simplifying assumptions). 
 
1. Example: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
case a)  
 
 
 
case b) 
Fig. 1.3. Example for explaining Ampere’s Law. 
• 
The magneto-motive force, the integration loop and the magnet-
ic circulation voltage are the same in both cases (Fig. 1.3). 
• 
But the distribution of the magnetic field strength on the integra-
tion loop is different (because of the additional current in case 
b)). 
• 
The calculation of the magnetic field strength is not possible in 
both cases without additional information. 
 
2. Example: 
Calculation of the magnetic field of a straight, current carrying con-
ductor (with the radius R) in air. 
Because of the symmetry the magnitude of the field strength is con-
stant at constant distance r from the center of the conductor.

(

ν = !

• 
Hν  is constant in each part. 
•

1.1.2.7 Examples for the Faraday’s Law (Second Maxwell’s Equation in

circulation voltage (“magnetic loss”), if the magnetic flux linked with this conduc-
tor loop changes with time:

The time-dependent variation of the flux may originate from: 
• time-dependent variation of the induction with stationary conductor loop; 
• movement of the conductor loop (totally or partly) relative to the stationary 
magnetic field. 
Obviously, the difference comes from the choice of the coordinate system.

This coil is moved in x-direction with the speed v, penetrating a station-
ary stepwise magnetic field being constant in time with

“e”. As it has the nature of a voltage, here the name “

Because of the considerable lower energy density there are virtually no electro-
static machines, except for extremely small geometries (please refer to equations 
(1.46) and (1.48)). In the following, the energy stored in the electrical field will be 
neglected against the energy stored in the magnetic field. 
 
The energy balance of the lifting magnet is:

The non time-dependent components U  and I  are called (complex) phasors. 
Phasors describe the amplitude of the respective variable with their length; the di-
rection of the phasor shows the position of the maximum of this variable. The in-
stantaneous value of the physical magnitude (voltage and current) results from the 
projection of the rotating phasors onto the real axis of the complex plane. The 
phasors rotate mathematically positive (anti-clockwise). 
The choice of the phase angle ϕ  is arbitrary as well, but usually the phase an-
gle of the voltage is chosen being zero. Defining the phase angle of the current 
like shown above, for resistive-inductive impedances (which are mostly relevant 
for electrical drives) positive values for the phase angle ϕ  are obtained. 
The orientation of the complex plane is arbitrary, but in the electrical power 
engineering usually the positive real axis is oriented vertically upright, the nega-
tive imaginary axis to the right. 
The complex impedance is:

1.6 Symmetric Components 
A symmetric three-phase system may be operated asymmetrically, e.g. by: 
• supplying with asymmetric voltages or 
• single-phase load between two phases or between one phase and the neutral 
line. 
Describing these asymmetric (unknown) operating conditions by symmetric 
ones, a simplified calculation method is gained. The method of symmetric compo-
nents is qualified for this: An asymmetric three-phase-system is separated into 
three symmetric systems (positive, negative, and zero system), the circuit calculat-
ed and the results superposed.  
The preconditions are: 
• The three currents or voltages have the same frequency and they are sinusoidal-
ly in time (i.e. there is no harmonic content); phase shift and amplitude are ar-
bitrary. 
• Because of the superposition of the results the system must be linear.

1.8 Iron Losses 
In addition to the copper losses (caused by current flow in wires having a re-
sistance) iron losses are known in electrical machines. These iron losses mainly 
are composed of two parts: 
According to Lenz’s Law the flux change in the electrical conducting iron ma-
terial causes eddy currents that oppose their generating induction variation. The 
eddy current losses are proportional to the squared frequency, the squared flux 
density and the iron volume:

These eddy current losses can be reduced by using isolated lamination sheets and 
by using iron laminations with low electrical conductivity. 
Because of ever changing magnetizing direction inside the iron hysteresis loss-
es are generated that are proportional to the area of the hysteresis loop enclosed 
during each cycle; these losses are proportional to the frequency, the squared flux 
density and the iron volume:

Fig. 2.1. Photograph of a DC-machine. 
The principle construction of a DC-machine is like follows: 
The stationary part (called “stator“) mostly is composed of massive iron (to 
lead the magnetic flux). A stationary magnetic field with changing polarity is gen-
erated, either by permanent magnets (see Fig. 2.1) or by salient poles having coils 
with DC-currents. 
The movable part (called “rotor“) - separated from the stator by an air-gap - is 
composed of an iron stack made from laminations, in whose slots coils made from 
copper are placed. These coils are connected with the clamps of the commutator 
segments. On the commutator the carbon brushes are sliding, so that the current is 
supplied from the stationary terminals to the rotating coils. 
By this commutator the supplied DC-current permanently changes direction in 
the rotor in such a way, that the current in the rotor coils below a permanent mag-
net pole of the stator always flows in the same direction (under the magnet pole 
with opposite polarity the current flows in opposite direction). By this changing of 
current flow direction in the rotor coils an alternating current arises.

2.2 Voltage and Torque Generation, Commutation 
In principle each electrical machine can be operated as motor or as generator. In 
generator operation usually voltage production constant in time is required, in mo-
tor operation usually torque production constant in time is asked for. 
In a rotating coil a voltage is induced according to the induction law, see Fig. 
2.2.

The commutator converts the AC-voltage in the coil into a DC-voltage (with 
harmonics) at the terminals. By series connection of several coils evenly distribut-
ed along the rotor circumference a higher DC-voltage with lower harmonic con-
tent is obtained. 
The procedure of commutation is explained in Fig. 2.5:

The current flows via a carbon brush, a commutator 
section, through a coil and via the counterpart com-
mutator section and carbon brush. 
For motor operation a torque in the direction of mo-
tion occurs. 
 
 
 
2) 
Under each carbon brush both commutator sections 
are located; there is no current in the coil (begin and 
end of the coil are short-circuited via the brushes) 
and no torque is generated. 
The rotor of the DC-motor stays in rotational 
movement because of its inertia. 
 
 
 
3) 
Like in case 1) current is flowing in the coil, but the 
commutator (after 180° rotation of the rotor) has 
forced a change of current flow direction in the coil. 
Therefore, torque and current at the terminals have 
the same direction like in case 1).

Up to now two-pole machines were presented. Nevertheless, DC-machines with 
even more poles are possible. For these constructions the arrangement is repeated 
p times along the circumference (e.g. for p
2

 there are 4 carbon brushes and 4 
magnets or excitation poles).

• The total flux is divided into 2p part fluxes. By this the cross section of the 
yokes in stator and rotor can be chosen smaller (material savings). 
• A smaller pole pitch results in shorter end windings (with smaller resistance 
and lower losses). 
The disadvantages are: 
• By having smaller distances between the poles the leakage between the poles is 
increased. 
• The losses are increased by the higher rotor frequency. 
Therefore, the choice of the number of pole pairs is an optimization task. 
The pole pitch is calculated according to:

The winding placed in the slots of the rotor stack often is realized as two-layer 
winding: The forward conductors are in the upper layer (i.e. towards the air-gap), 
the return conductors in the lower layer (i.e. towards the slot bottom). In Figs. 2.7 
to 2.9, showing the general situations “wound-off”, solid lines represent the for-
ward conductors (upper layer) and dashed lines the return conductors (lower lay-
er). For DC-machines each coil at the beginning and at the end is connected to a 
commutator section, i.e. the number of coils and the number of commutator sec-
tions are identical; in the following this will be named with the variable K . 
For DC-machines the following nominations are introduced: 
 
K  
number of commutator sections (equal to number of coils) 
 
u  
number of coils sides side-by-side in a single slot 
 
N  
number of rotor slots 
 
S
w  
number of turns per coil (number of conductors per coil side)

the negative brush) is:

Examples (lap winding): 
• In Fig. 2.7 the three upper sketches show the conductors in a rotor slot for dif-
ferent winding layout. 
• The lower sketches illustrate the according winding layout (in each sketch on 
the left side only the upper layer and on the right side only the lower layer is 
shown). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2.7. Sketches of conductors in a slot (above) and the according winding layout (below). 
The coils can be connected to the commutator in two different ways: 
Having a lap winding (Fig. 2.8) the end of a coil is connected directly to the 
beginning of the next coil of the same pole pair at the commutator. Between two 
commutator sections only one coil is placed. All p pole pairs are connected in se-
ries by the carbon brushes; the number of parallel paths in the rotor is: 2a
2p
=
. 
The total rotor current is therefore divided into 2p  parallel conductor currents.  
Naming the coil width with 
1
y  (in numbers of rotor slots) and the connection step 
with 
2
y  (in numbers of rotor slots), then the commutator step y  for the lap wind-
ing is (see Fig. 2.8):

Having a wave (or series) winding (Fig. 2.9) the end of a coil is connected with 
the beginning of a corresponding coil of the next pole pair, so that - until reaching 
the neighboring commutator section - a path along the circumference of the rotor 
with p coils is completed. Between positive and negative carbon brush all p pole

2.4 Main Equations of the DC-Machine      45 
For the wave winding an arbitrary number of pole pairs can be realized with 
just two carbon brushes, because all positive brushes and all negative brushes are 
connected in series, respectively. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.9 by hatching one 
positive brush and one negative brush. 
2.4 Main Equations of the DC-Machine

Here 
i
α  is the pole arc in parts of the pole pitch (
i
α  is a dimensionless number 
that gives the ratio between pole arc and pole pitch).

(magnetic saturation). These limits can be described by the values B (flux density) 
and A (current loading). The “current loading“ is a theoretical concept, that sim-
plifies the winding placed in the slots: It is assumed that the conductors are dis-
tributed infinitely thin on the rotor surface (please refer to Sect. 3.2). The follow-

2.5.1 Induced Voltage 
Up to now the calculation of the induced voltage and the torque was performed as-
suming that the conductors of the rotor are lying in the air-gap field. But the con-
ductors of the rotor are placed in the rotor slots; the magnetic field is guided 
around the rotor winding by means of the surrounding iron (Fig. 2.13).

The sign of the induced voltage depends on the direction of movement of the 
conductor coil (i.e. depending on the direction of movement of the rotor, because 
the conductor coil is placed inside the rotor slots). 
In total the following can be stated: The induced voltage of wires placed in 
slots can be calculated as if these wires would lie in the air-gap field. 
2.5.2 Torque 
In the preceding section the calculation of the induced voltage was performed us-
ing the “wound-off” representation, in this section the computation will be done 
using the original rotatory geometry (of course, both calculations can be per-
formed using the other alternative).

The sign of the force is – at constant stator field – depending on the direction of 
the current in the coil (i.e. depending on the direction of the voltage switched to 
the conductor coil). 
In total the following can be stated: The force onto wires placed in slots can be 
calculated as if these wires would lie in the air-gap field. 
The force does not act directly onto the wires, but it acts onto the iron teeth be-
cause of different flux densities. From the force calculation the torque generated 
by the machine can be deduced. Therefore, even the torque direction depends on 
the current direction in the rotor (i.e. depending on the direction of the DC-voltage 
switched to the rotor coils).

Fig. 2.18. Torque and speed versus current of the separately excited DC-machine for voltage var-
iation. 
Therefore, the no-load speed is decreased, but the slope of the speed character-
istic does not change. The relation between torque and rotor current remains un-
changed. The stall (short-circuit) current is decreased proportional to the terminal 
voltage; the direction of rotation can be changed by reversing the polarity of the 
terminal voltage (Fig 2.18). 
The speed control by changing the terminal voltage is lossless. Because of the 
small rotor time constant this alternative for speed control is highly dynamic. 
 
2. Reduction of the flux: 
Reducing the excitation flux (by reducing the excitation current) and neglecting 
the saturation, it follows:

Fig. 2.19. Torque and speed versus current of the separately excited DC-machine for flux varia-
tion. 
With increasing field weakening (field weakening factor f
1
>
) the no-load 
speed is increased and the slope of the speed characteristic rises (i.e. loading the 
machine means an exceeded speed reduction). At constant rotor current the torque 
decreases with increasing field weakening (Fig. 2.19). 
The speed control by field weakening is lossless, but (because of the usually 
large time constant of the excitation winding) it is less dynamic compared with the 
speed control by changing the terminal voltage. 
 
 
3. Increasing the rotor resistance (series resistance): 
By inserting a series resistance 
S

creased. The following equations are obtained:

Fig. 2.20. Torque and speed versus current of the separately excited DC-machine for series re-
sistance variation. 
The no-load speed 
0
n  remains unchanged, the same holds true for the relation 
between torque and rotor current. The slope of the speed characteristic increases, 
i.e. loading the machine means an exceeded speed reduction. The stall (short-
circuit) current is reduced by increasing the series resistance, therefore this alter-
native is used for starting the motor (Fig. 2.20). 
Because of the additional losses in the series resistance (
2
S A
R I
) this method is 
not lossless. 
 
The following general operational limits have to be obeyed: 
• In continuous operation the acceptable heating may not be exceeded:

• Even in field weakening operation the machine may not be overloaded:

In literature the characteristics of DC-machines are often shown versus the ro-
tor current 
A
I  (see Figs. 2.18 to 2.20). Describing rotating field machines, mainly 
the speed is used as horizontal axis. To make the comparison of the characteristics 
easier, Fig. 2.21 shows the torque of a separately excited DC-machine as a func-
tion of the speed (this is the same relation like in the preceding figures, it is just il-
lustrated in a different way).

2.7 Permanent Magnet Excited DC-Machines 
The permanent magnet excited DC-machine can be regarded as being a special 
case of the separately excited DC-machine. Even for this alternative the speed 
control can be performed by changing the terminal voltage and by introducing a 
series resistance. But field weakening is not possible (because the permanent 
magnets impress the magnetic flux). The advantages of the permanent magnet ex-
citation against the electrical excitation are (please refer to Fig. 2.22): 
• smaller outer diameter 
• smaller volume and weight 
• more simple construction (no stator winding, less terminal contacts) 
• higher efficiency (no excitation losses) 
• more cost-effective production 
• better dynamics (no field increase by excitation current increase)

Under load the flux density in the magnet

 at the run-on edge is higher than

Therefore, under load the flux density in the magnet 
M

 at the run-off edge is 
smaller than under no-load condition. The danger of demagnetization occurs 
(please refer to “armature reaction“, Sect. 2.12)! 
Especially for applications with a wide temperature range the demagnetization 
must be checked in the entire temperature range as the magnet characteristic 
changes with temperature. 
Typical values of remanent flux density (
R
B ) and coercive field strength (
C
H ) 
and the respective temperature coefficients for different magnet materials are 
shown in Table 2.2.

As counter-measure against the danger of demagnetization the magnet height

To illustrate the effect of different demagnetization danger at the run-on edge 
and the run-off edge, Fig. 2.27 shows the field lines of a 2-pole 12 slots DC-motor 
with ferrite magnets with and without rotor currents.

2.8 Shunt-Wound DC-Machines 
For the shunt-wound DC-machine the excitation winding is connected in parallel 
to the rotor circuit. This results in the equivalent circuit diagram shown in Fig. 
2.28. In this figure the resistance 
F
R  is drawn with the symbol of an inductivity. 
This makes obvious that  
• 
in the excitation circuit an inductivity is present, but  
• 
in the steady-state operation regarded here only the resistance is effective. 
Similar depictions are even chosen in Figs. 2.30, 2.32, and 2.37.

For speed control or change of speed direction the change of the terminal volt-
age is without effect, because the excitation current and the rotor current are 
changed or reversed simultaneously. The speed can only be changed by using the 
series resistances: 
• in the rotor circuit: lossy speed reduction 
• in the excitation circuit: nearly lossless speed increase 
The characteristics are analogously to those of the separately excited DC-
machine.

the always present residual magnetism in every iron circuit. This voltage generates 
an excitation current

I , which strengthens the residual field and the induced 
voltage is increased. This happens as long as the induced voltage is equal to the 
voltage drop across the resistances in the excitation circuit. Then a stable operat-

Switching on the excitation winding in opposite direction, the excitation current 
demagnetizes the circuit and the self-excitation does not take place. 
The series resistance in the excitation circuit 
F,S
R
 has two effects: 
• the generator voltage can be set and 
• the time constant of the excitation winding can be reduced to speed-up the self-
excitation. 
This series resistance may not exceed a critical value, because otherwise the 
self-excitation does not take place.

2.9 Series-Wound DC-Machines 
For the series-wound DC-machine the excitation winding is switched in series to 
the rotor circuit, see Fig. 2.32. The series resistance in the rotor circuit and the re-
sistance parallel to the excitation winding can be used for speed control. As the 
excitation current of this alternative depends on the load, the speed characteristic 
of the series-wound DC-machine is principally different to the DC-machines dis-
cussed so far.

By reversing the polarity of the terminal voltage no speed reversal can be ob-

For speed control the following possibilities can be used (in Figs. 2.34 to 2.36 
always the motor operation is illustrated):

2.10 Compound DC-Machines 
The compound (double shunt-wound) DC-machine contains two excitation wind-
ings (Fig. 2.37). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2.37. Equivalent circuit diagram of the compound DC-machine. 
By dividing the excitation winding into a shunt-wound part and a series-wound 
part the compound DC-machine has shunt-wound characteristic near the no-load 
operation and series-wound characteristic when loading the machine. 
The torque-speed-characteristics of the three DC-machine alternatives are qual-
itatively shown in Fig. 2.38. 
The most relevant characteristics are: 
• series-wound DC-machine:  
o 
weak characteristic (high starting torque and relatively low nom-
inal torque) 
o 
danger of “run away “ at low load 
• shunt-wound DC-machine: 
o 
stiff characteristic (the speed depends only marginally on the 
load) 
o 
fixed no-load speed

2.11 Generation of a Variable Terminal Voltage

the usage of the so-called “Leonard machine set“ (Fig. 2.39):

terminal voltage. With the Leonard-converter operation in all four quadrants is 
possible. 
Today most often the inverter supply is used to generate a variable terminal 
voltage. 
With a controlled three-phase bridge (see left-hand side in Fig. 2.40) an opera-
tion in two quadrants is possible (no energy recovery); switching two controlled 
three-phase bridges in parallel and opposite to each other (see right-hand side in 
Fig. 2.40) an operation in all four quadrants is possible.  
Principle circuit diagram, switching diagram, and the voltages of a controlled 
three-phase bridge are shown in Fig. 2.41.

2.12 Armature Reaction 
Up to now it was assumed that the magnetic field in the air-gap of the DC-
machine is generated solely by the excitation winding. But this is only the case for 
no-load operation (
A
I
0
=
). Loading the machine (i.e. if 
A
I
0
≠
 is true), the rotor 
current generates a magneto-motive force as well (Fig. 2.42); this is oriented per-
pendicular to the magneto-motive force of the excitation winding. By superposi-
tion of these magneto-motive forces the resulting field is generated (“armature re-
action“).

The magnetic neutral zone is shifted against the geometric neutral zone depend-
ing on the load (for motor operation against the direction of rotation, for generator 
operation in the direction of rotation). If saturation occurs the peaks of the result-
ing field are rounded. With this even the mean value of the flux density decreases 
and consequently even the torque.

Fig. 2.43. Magneto-motive forces of stator and rotor current (above) and resulting air-gap flux 
density (below). 
By this field deformation even the voltage between two commutator segments 
no longer is distributed evenly along the circumference of the rotor. The voltage 
between two commutator segments can be locally increased by far (but the mean 
value remains unchanged, if saturation is neglected). 
In field weakening operation it may happen that the field under the run-off edge 
of the rotor (in motor operation) becomes negative, because the main field de-
creases and the armature reaction remains constant. 
To compensate the armature reaction and their negative effects a compensation 
winding may be introduced to the DC-machine. To realize this the main poles are 
equipped with slots; the conductors placed in these slots have to be supplied with 
the rotor current in opposite direction. The number of turns of this compensation 
winding has to be chosen in such a way that the magneto-motive force of the rotor 
under the poles is compensated. Then the field distribution under the poles is equal 
to that in no-load operation (as the compensation winding is supplied with the ro-
tor current, this is true for arbitrary operating conditions, i.e. independent from the 
load) (Fig. 2.44).

The axis of the resulting field is now identical to the axis of the excitation field; 
the commutation takes place in the neutral zone. 
A compensation winding increases the costs of a DC-machine by far. There-
fore, this is realized only for large machines. 
2.13 Commutation Pole 
In Sect. 2.2 it was assumed that the rotor current is linear during commutation. 
This is the case if the inductivities can be neglected and mainly the resistances de-
termine the commutation behavior (Fig. 2.46).

In reality there is a non-negligible inductivity because of the slot and end wind-
ing leakage. By current change in the coil which is short-circuited by the carbon 
brushes a voltage of self-induction is generated. With the coil inductivity

Therefore, this voltage during current commutation is proportional to the rotor 
current and the speed. According to Lenz’s Law this voltage has such a direction 
that it acts against its generating reason (current change). This results in a delayed 
commutation, producing sparks at the run-off edges of the carbon brushes. This 
spark generation results in increased wear of the brushes and the commutator (Fig. 
2.47). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2.47. Current characteristic during non-ideal commutation. 
Compensating now this voltage coming from current commutation by a rotato-
ry induced voltage, a linear commutation is reached. To realize this so-called 
commutation poles are inserted in the area between the main poles (commutation 
zones). The windings of these commutation poles are switched in series with the 
rotor winding. The principle sketch (Fig. 2.48) shows the cross section of a DC-
machine with compensation windings and commutation poles.

Consequently, the voltage coming from current commutation can be compen-

spark generation (Fig. 2.49).

3 Rotating Field Theory 
3.1 Stator of a Rotating Field Machine 
Induction machines and synchronous machines are rotating field machines. The 
stator construction of these machine types are principally the same, they differ in 
the rotor design. The similarity of these machine types are discussed first, later a 
detailed consideration of induction machine and synchronous machine will follow.  
In the simplest alternative the stator is composed of a stack with electrically 
isolated laminations to reduce eddy currents. Windings are placed in the slots of 
the lamination stack. Usually there are m

by a spatial angle of

with p  being the number of pole pairs of the machine. These three phases are

3.2 Current Loading 
The magnetic field in the air-gap of an electrical machine shows decisive im-
portance on the characteristics of the machine, e.g. concerning torque generation. 
Therefore, the air-gap field has to be calculated precisely. 
The reason causing this air-gap field are the current containing conductors in 
the slots of the stator. Because of the complicated geometry (even the description 
in the last section is very simplified) this is not possible easily. Therefore, in the

following the air-gap field will be separated from the field in the slots by means of 
the idealized assumption of a homogeneous field in the slot openings, please refer 
to Fig. 3.3 (in other words: after separating both parts of the field – field in the air-
gap and field in the slots – not the entire field considering the complicated lamina-
tion contour has to be calculated, but both parts may be calculated separately). 
For this a single slot is regarded, whereupon the relative permeability of the 
surrounding iron is assumed being very large against that of air (
Fe
μ
→∞). Then, 
in the slot there will be a so-called slot leakage field, that can be easily deduced 
from Ampere’s Law (
Hd = Θ
³
G

A
v
). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3.3. Detailed view of a stator slot. 
This slot leakage field joins to the air-gap field at the border between the slot 
opening and the air-gap. As the air-gap field is to be calculated the slot leakage 
field is a boundary condition for this calculation. The field in the slot opening 
(
SO
H
), which can be simplified being tangential concerning the machine geome-
try, can be computed easily from Ampere’s Law (

This boundary condition for calculating the air-gap field can be generated even

 and infinitely thin onto the smooth 
iron surface (the light blue color in Fig. 3.4 means that the slot notionally is filled

This proves that the boundary condition for calculating the air-gap field is un-
changed, if the conductors in the stator slots are replaced by an according current 
loading on the smooth iron surface (in other words: the effect of the magneto-
motive force of the slot onto the air-gap field is represented with sufficient accura-
cy by a current loading distributed in the area of the slot opening). With this it is 
successfully accomplished to separate the air-gap field from the field in the slots. 
For the calculation of the air-gap field the field in the slots is not to be consid-
ered. In addition, a quite simple geometry can be regarded: The boundary contours 
of stator and rotor can be assumed being smooth. This results in a machine with 
constant air-gap and therefore even a constant magnetic air-gap reluctance. 
For calculating the magneto-motive force distribution an additional simplifica-
tion will be introduced in the next section: The current loading A will be assumed 
being concentrated in the center of the slot in tangential direction (and not distrib-
uted across the area of the slot opening). With this the entire magneto-motive

Θ  is concentrated in a single line on the smooth stator iron surface 
in axial direction4. 
3.3 Alternating and Rotating Magneto-Motive Force  
Supplying the winding (with w turns) of a single slot pair with the current i results 
in magneto-motive forces of these slots of 
wi
+
 and wi
−
.  
Now the space-dependent magneto-motive force 
( )
Θ α  shall be calculated. As 
the magneto-motive force is defined as an integral value (
Hd
Θ = ³
G
G
A
v
), the cal-
culation of 
( )
Θ α  only makes sense, if the integration loop is defined simultane-
ously. The circulation integral will be defined as follows: The air-gap always is 
crossed radially and the loop always is going through the middle of the slot „u“. 
The field intensity in the iron is neglected (
Fe
μ
→∞), so that the exact path of the 
integration loop in the iron is not relevant (see Fig. 3.5). 
Is the angle α  larger than zero, the integration loop includes half of the slot 
“u“ (direction of the loop and direction of the current are assigned positive); then 
( )
Θ α  is equal to ½ wi. This is the case for 0 < α < π . At α = π  the magneto-
motive force steps by the amount of wi into the negative direction. Therefore, for 
2
π < α <
π  there is 
( )
Θ α = -½ wi (Fig. 3.5).

netic field characteristics will be discussed.

3.3 Alternating and Rotating Magneto-Motive Force      95 
This magneto-motive force distribution is characterized by the facts that the ze-
ro crossings are constant in space and time. The amplitude changes in time propor-
tional to the current. This distribution is an alternating magneto-motive force. 
If the machine contains more than one pole pair the magneto-motive force 
(

 is repeated p-times on the circumference. Distributing the number of 
turns on the p pole pairs the alternating magneto-motive force (now characterized

The harmonic waves are generated only from the spatial distribution of the

Convention: 
• A wave is a space-dependent event. 
• An oscillation is a time-dependent event. 
As it is well-known, a stationary wave can be composed of two waves with half 
of the amplitude travelling with equal speed in opposite direction. Then the fun-
damental wave of the alternating magneto-motive force can be described as fol-
lows:

tal wave and inversely proportional to the ordinal number (i.e. with higher ordinal 
number the angular frequency decreases). 
After having analyzed the magneto-motive force distribution of the winding of 
a single slot pair, all three slot pairs of a three-phase machine will be looked at in

3.3 Alternating and Rotating Magneto-Motive Force      101 
The total magneto-motive force of all three phases can be obtained by summing 
up the three single magneto-motive forces (for this, linearity is necessary, i.e. satu-
ration is neglected):

forces of equal amplitude and frequency (the zero crossings are constant in time, 
but the maximum values are time-dependent).

The angular frequency of the fundamental wave is equal to 
p
ω
; the angular 
frequency of the harmonic waves is proportional to that of the fundamental wave 
and inversely proportional to the ordinal number (i.e. with higher ordinal number 
the absolute value of the angular frequency decreases).  
3.4 Winding Factor 
As demonstrated in the last section the rotating magneto-motive force contains 
harmonic waves with amplitudes decreasing with the ordinal number. Generally, 
in rotating field machines only the fundamental wave produces a useful torque, all 
harmonic waves generate parasitic torques, that disturb the machine operation 
(e.g. no starting or sticking at low speed). 
Therefore, measures are necessary to damp the harmonic waves, but only mar-
ginally affect the fundamental wave. Mainly, the following two measures are 
used:  
• Distributing the winding per pole and per phase into several slots (distributed 
winding). 
• Distributing the forward and return conductors of a coil in such a way, that they 
are no longer shifted by an electrical angle of π  (i.e. mechanical angle of 
p
π
), but by an electrical angle less than π  (short-pitch winding). 
The effects of both measures will be calculated in the following by a common 
mathematical deduction. Firstly, the magneto-motive force of a single slot pair 
(known from the proceeding section) is required:

The w p  turns per pole and per phase will now be distributed into q equally 
spaced slots and two layers in radial direction, see Fig. 3.13.  
• All

 stator slots are equally spaced at the circumference of the ma-
chine. The mechanical angle between two slots is then:

The effect of the distributed winding is that the fundamental waves of the mag-
neto-motive forces of the single slots are added as much as possible undisturbed, 
but the harmonic waves are nearly compensated.

(3.59) 
Using this deduction, implicitly it is assumed that there is only a radial compo-
nent of the air-gap field (see Eq. 3.57). This simplification is allowed as far as the 
wave length of the regarded field wave is large against the air-gap width (i.e. the 
equations deduced in the following are not valid for waves with very large ordinal 
numbers; usually these waves are of minor interest). Furthermore it is assumed 
that the radial component of the magnetic flux density virtually is unchanged in 
radial direction inside the air-gap.  
By using the concept of electric loading the winding placed in the slots is sim-
plified theoretically. In the following different alternatives of this simplification 
are examined. 
3.5.2. Uniformly Distributed Current Loading in a Zone 
The most simple alternative is that all conductors are uniformly distributed infi-
nitely thin on the stator surface (i.e. q →∞). Figure 3.17 illustrates such a current 
loading for a single phase:

Fig. 3.17. Current loading and flux density of alternative 1. 
3.5.3. Current Loading Concentrated in the Middle of Each Slot 
Another possibility is to locate the conductors of a slot (theoretically infinitely 
thin) in the middle of the corresponding slot opening. Analogously to Fig. 3.17 
this is shown in Fig. 3.18 for q
3
=
 (for the flux density distribution there is a step 
curve):

116      3 Rotating Field Theory 
3.5.4. Current Loading Distributed Across Each Slot Opening 
Finally it is possible to distribute the conductors of a slot (theoretically infinitely 
thin) in the area of the respective slot opening. Then the slope of the steps in the 
flux density characteristic will be less steep (Fig. 3.19). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3.19. Current loading and flux density of alternative 3. 
Which alternative has to be chosen for a specific task inter alia depends on the 
task itself. For example, if the fundamental torque of the machine has to be calcu-
lated usually a relatively rough model is sufficient. Computing characteristics 
where harmonic waves have a significant influence (typically calculating acoustic 
noise), a much more precise alternative has to be chosen. 
3.5.5. Rotating Air-Gap Field 
The rotating air-gap field is deduced from the rotating magneto-motive force. In 
practice, an air-gap width is used which is enlarged against the geometric air-gap 
width because of: 
• field distortion because of the slotting: 
C
K
′
δ →δ = δ
 (
C
K
 being Carter’s 
factor) and 
• magnetic reluctance (saturation) of the iron: ′

δ →δ . 
Neglecting this field distortion and the magnetic reluctance of the iron 
(

In Fig. 3.21 the field distribution is illustrated for two different instants in time, 
obtained by numerical calculation using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The 
stator contains 4 poles and 36 slots; the rotor is assumed being a cylindrical iron 
part. In addition, the phasors of the three currents, the current loading and the flux 
density are shown. The travelling rotating waves can be deduced clearly.

In the following the induced voltage will be calculated, which is generated in a ro-
tor coil (winding with 
2
w  turns) by a rotating field of the stator (winding with 
1
w  turns). The relative position 
( )t

 is arbitrary (see Fig. 3.22). For this, the 
flux linkage of the rotor coil has to be calculated firstly. This is done by integra-
tion of the air-gap flux density across one pole pitch

The induced voltage will be calculated from the time-derivative of the magnetic

the time-dependent currents as well as by the time-dependent position of the rotor 
coil.

Prior to calculating the induced voltage in detail, the “slip” shall be introduced 
here: 
 
The slip is the difference between the speed of the rotating field wave of the 
stator and the speed of the rotor (i.e. the mechanical speed), relative to the respec-
tive speed of the rotating field wave of the stator.  
With the angular frequency of the rotor 
 
d

α = Ω =
π  
(3.68) 
and the angular frequency of the harmonic field waves

The voltages

 induced by the rotating field waves offer the fol-
lowing characteristics: 
• The amplitudes of the induced voltages are proportional to the flux of the har-
monic wave, to the frequency of the supplying voltage, and to the slip.  
• The frequency of all induced voltages is equal to the slip frequency.  
• At stand-still of the rotor ( n
0
=
, i.e. 
6g 1
s
1
+ =
) the frequency of all voltages 
induced by the harmonic waves is equal to the supply frequency.

Consequently, no fundamental voltage ( g

) is induced; but the harmonic 
waves induce harmonic voltage oscillations with different frequencies.  
• At other speeds the fundamental wave and each harmonic wave of the rotating 
stator field induce a voltage of different frequency into the rotor coil.  
• The phase shift of the induced voltages in the rotor coil only depends on the 
spatial position of the coil

Incorporating a three-phase winding even to the rotor, the three phases will be 
shifted by an angle of 2

phase q

sidered. The induced voltage of the kth ( k

At this time the numbers of pole pairs, the angular frequencies and the phase 
shift between the stator and rotor rotating magneto-motive forces shall be arbi-
trary. Figure 3.24 schematically illustrates the spatial position of the magneto-
motive force distributions by means of phasors: the position of each phasor shows 
the position of the maximum of the magneto-motive force distribution, the length 
of the phasor is a quantity for the amplitude (please refer to Sect. 1.4).

4 Induction Machines 
4.1 Construction and Equivalent Circuit Diagram 
Stator and rotor of an induction machine - separated by an air-gap - contain each a 
symmetric winding in their slots.  
The stator with the number of phases 
1
m
3
=
 and the effective number of turns 
1 1
w ξ  is supplied by a symmetric three-phase system with the frequency 1f . Con-
sequently, a rotating field is generated, that rotates with the synchronous speed 
0
1
n
f
p
=
. To produce a constant torque, the number of pole pairs of stator and 
rotor are identical (
1
2
p
p
p
=
=
). 
The rotor winding can either be short-circuited directly or it can be passed out-
side the rotor via slip rings, and there be short-circuited directly or via series resis-
tors. In the 
2
m  phases of the closed rotor winding with the effective number of 
turns 
2

w ξ  currents are induced by the rotating field. These rotor currents togeth-
er with the rotating field of the stator generate the torque that rotates the rotor with 
the mechanical speed 
(
)
0
n
1
s n
=
−
. 
During motor operation the rotor always rotates with a speed lower than the 
synchronous speed 
0
n  (i.e. asynchronous to the rotating field of the stator cur-
rents), because at synchronous speed no currents are induced into the rotor wind-
ing and therefore no torque is generated. This differential speed between rotating 
field of the stator and the rotor is 
2
0
n
sn
=
; in the rotor currents with the frequen-
cy 
2

 are induced. These currents generate a rotating field of the rotor that 
(relative to the rotor) rotates with the speed 
2
n . Relative to the stator this rotating 
field has the speed 
2
0
n
n
n

. Consequently, the frequency condition to obtain a 
constant torque (please refer to Sect. 3.7) is fulfilled.

chine windings:

three stator and rotor windings in zones with 2p=2; right: symbolic representation). 
To reach an easier mathematical description of this electrical machine firstly 
the system of coupled and movable coils shall be transformed to a system with sta-
tionary elements with the same numbers of phases and turns in stator and rotor. 
For this, in the following only the fundamental waves will be considered. For 
calculation of the steady-state operation the calculation with complex phasors will 
be applied. Because of symmetry reasons a single-phase treatment is sufficient.  
The windings of stator and rotor can be described with lumped parameters: re-
sistance, leakage and main inductivity. Then the equivalent circuit diagram looks 
like it is shown in Fig. 4.2 (both partial systems are represented as “energy con-
sumption system”):

From this the following equivalent circuit diagram can be deduced (Fig. 4.3). It 
becomes obvious that in comparison to Fig. 4.2 a galvanic coupling is introduced 
that simplifies the calculation of induction machines.

Please note that in this equivalent circuit diagram all values are transformed to 
stator frequency, phase number of the stator, and effective number of turns of the 
stator. For s

4.2.3 Leakage Inductivity 
The leakage is composed of harmonic leakage, leakage of the end windings, and 
the slot leakage. These three parts are calculated separately and then added up. 
The separate consideration of single field components is already explained in Sect. 
3.2 (for the slot and air-gap regions); even here such a separation of the field re-
gions is performed. The summation of the partial results (i.e. superposition) is al-
lowed because of the assumed linearity. 
4.2.3.1 Harmonic Leakage 
It has been shown in the rotating field theory that all harmonic waves induce volt-
ages of equal frequencies and phase shift in their generating winding. All these 
voltages may therefore be added. The sum of these voltages can be interpreted as 
voltage drop at a leakage reactance, because they do not produce a useful magnet-
ic field.

4.3.4 Series Resistance in the Rotor Circuit 
Having machines equipped with slip rings on the rotor, series resistances can be 
added to the rotor circuit. Doing this the Heyland-diagram remains unchanged (it 
is independent from the rotor resistance, see above). But the parameterization is 
changed.

Fig. 4.17. Heyland-diagram of the induction motor: series resistance in the rotor circuit. 
When introducing series resistances to the rotor circuit the absolute value of the 
pull-out torque remains unchanged; but the starting point is shifted into the direc-
tion of the pull-out torque. It is even possible to start-up the machine with the pull-
out torque (
pull out
s

∗∗
−
= ). Simultaneously, the phase current at stand-still is re-
duced. These advantages are opposed by higher rotor losses. 
Moreover, with the series resistances an open-loop speed control under load is 
possible, but this generates losses in the series resistances and therefore it is used 
only occasionally.

4.3.5 Operation with Optimum Power Factor 
During no-load of the induction machine the stator phase current is a pure reactive 
current 
 0
I
. This corresponds to the magnetizing reactive (wattless) power re-
quired for the operation of the induction machine. This reactive power is supplied 
by the mains. There is:

To reduce the no-load current as far as possible, the air-gap should be as small 
as possible. But technical limits (bending of the axis, bearing tolerances) as well 
as economic limits (precision of the production) have to be considered. Usually it

The nominal operating point of the induction machine often is chosen to max-
imize the power factor

cos ϕ  (then the load to the supplying mains because of 
the reactive current is smallest). The operating point with maximum 
( )
cos ϕ  is 
called “optimum point”. It is obtained by a tangent of the stator current onto the 
Heyland-diagram (Fig. 4.19):

Changes of the machine parameters have the following influences onto the 
Heyland-diagram and therefore onto the operational characteristics: 
• Increasing the air-gap the main reactance 
1
X  is decreased. This means that the 
magnetizing current 
0I  is enlarged. 
• By decreasing the leakage reactance (e.g. decreasing 
2
X σ
′
 by utilizing the skin-
effect) the current I∞ increases. By this the pull-out torque and the stand-still 
current are getting larger. 
• Increasing the rotor resistance 
2
R′  (e.g. by utilizing the skin-effect) changes the 
parameterization of the slip line. It is possible to start-up the motor with higher 
torque and lower phase current, but this is opposed by higher rotor losses.

In the following the equivalent circuit diagram with stator and rotor leakage reac-
tance is used (Fig. 4.21).

 further equations can easily be deduced. 
The above equations are valid for supplying the machine with sinusoidal volt-
ages and currents (the capital letters symbolize rms-values or peak-values, de-
pending if electrical or magnetic variables are indicated). The torque calculation 
for arbitrary time dependencies of the supplying voltages and currents is per-
formed in Sect. 8.9. With arbitrary time dependencies even dynamic operation 
conditions can be calculated, generally the torque is then no longer constant but 
time-dependent (in contrast to the steady-state behavior regarded in this chapter). 
4.4 Squirrel Cage Rotor 
4.4.1 Fundamentals 
The squirrel cage rotor (cage rotor) of an induction machine in its simplest form is 
composed of stacked iron laminations; in the slots of this stack bars (made from 
copper or aluminum) are inserted and these bars are connected with rings (made 
from copper or aluminum) in both axial end regions. For machines with small 
power the slots are filled by aluminum die-cast and the end rings are realized in 

4.4 Squirrel Cage Rotor      167 
the same production step. The induction machine with cage rotor is the most often 
used electrical machine. It is simple, robust, and cost-effective (see Fig. 4.23 for 
an example).

Having 
2
N  rotor slots the cage winding can be interpreted as a multi-phase 
winding with 
2
N  phases. Here, each phase is composed of a single bar (better: 
each two neighboring bars, one half each, together with the connecting end ring 
segments, are composing the winding of a phase). The number of turns is then:

The number of pole pairs of the cage rotor is not determined by the winding, 
but because of the inductive effect the number of pole pairs of the stator is adopt-
ed.

three-phase winding):

4.4.2 Skewed Rotor Slots 
Apart from the fundamental wave there are even harmonic waves of the flux den-
sity distribution in the air-gap of the machine, e.g. because of the winding distribu-
tion and the slotting effect. These harmonic waves can be regarded as “leakage 
fields” (air-gap leakage, harmonic leakage). However, having a cage rotor these 
field waves can induce voltages and corresponding currents like the fundamental 
wave and consequently generate (disturbing) torque components. By skewing the 
rotor bars the effect of the harmonic waves can be reduced, because the flux pene-
trating a cage mesh is different: 

4.4 Squirrel Cage Rotor      171 
• for skewed and unskewed bars the flux of the fundamental wave is nearly the 
same, whereas 
• the flux of a higher harmonic wave is large for unskewed bars and it is reduced 
for skewed rotor bars. 
Figure 4.26 schematically illustrates a rotor with skewed rotor bars. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 4.26. Sketch of a squirrel cage rotor with skewed rotor slots. 
The ordinal numbers of the rotating field generated by a symmetric three-phase 
winding are (please refer to Chap. 3 “Rotating Field Theory”):

For g

ν = , the fundamental wave is obtained. 
Regarding a skewed rotor mesh in a “wound-off” representation (x-coordinate: 
circumferential direction; y-coordinate: axial direction), Fig. 4.27 can be drawn. 
For the fundamental wave and the harmonic waves of the air-gap field the fol-
lowing is true (for better distinction here the amplitude of the magnetic flux densi-
ty is marked by “ ˆ “):

4.4.3 Skin Effect 
Because of the massive bars there is always a single-sided skin effect (towards the 
slot opening) with cage rotors: the slot leakage fields cross the bars and induce 
voltages, that are accompanied by eddy currents and consequently uneven current 
distribution. According to Lenz’s Law these induced voltages are directed in such 
a way, that the hereby generated eddy currents act against their reason; please re-
fer to Fig. 4.29 for the principle geometry, the current density distribution ( )
J x  
and the flux density distribution ( )
B x . 
The integral of the superposed eddy currents across the slot cross section is 
equal to zero, i.e. the total current is unchanged (only the current distribution is 
changed across the cross section). 
Generally, the skin effect is unwanted in electrical machines, because this gen-
erates additional losses in the bars and therefore is the reason for higher heating 
and lower efficiency.

Fig. 4.29. Current density and flux density distribution in massive rotor bars (above: DC current; 
below: AC current). 
For induction machines with cage rotor this skin effect however can be used to 
improve the starting behavior: Because of the skin effect the rotor resistance is 
higher at starting operation (i.e. at high frequency of the rotor currents) and there-
fore even the starting torque is higher. Simultaneously, the leakage reactance be-
comes smaller (the flux density in the rotor bar is smaller), which means an in-
crease of the diameter of the Heyland-diagram. 
With increasing speed of the motor the skin effect gets smaller (because the 
frequency of the rotor currents gets smaller), until it is hardly noticeable at nomi-
nal operation. The Heyland-diagram C can now be composed of a diagram 
st
C  for 
starting and a diagram

4.5.1 Changing (Increasing) the Slip 
Either by resistances in the rotor circuit of a slip ring rotor or by decreasing the 
terminal voltage (

) the slip is increased. In both cases the additional slip 
power is transformed to heat and the efficiency is decreased:

4.5.2 Changing the Supply Frequency 
The power is taken from the 50Hz  three-phase mains, rectified and given to an 
inverter via an intermediate circuit (DC-current or DC-voltage) that supplies the 
induction machine with variable voltage (Fig. 4.34):

Fig. 4.36. Torque-speed-characteristics of the induction motor for different supply frequencies 
(with nominal supply frequency of 50Hz). 
If the supply frequency 1f  gets smaller, the stator resistance 
1
R  has to be con-
sidered, because then 
1
R  cannot be neglected any more against 
1
X . Considering 
1
R , the Heyland-diagram gets smaller and the pull-out torque decreases (because 
of the voltage drop at 
1
R ). For compensating the voltage drop at 
1
R  at low fre-
quency the voltage is reduced less than proportional to the frequency (to reach a 
constant stator flux). 
If the further increase of the voltage with frequency is not possible (this point is 
called “nominal operation point”) the pull-out torque decreases inversely propor-
tional to the squared frequency, see the characteristic for 1f
60Hz
=
 in Fig. 4.36. 
This operating region is called “field weakening region”. 
4.5.3 Changing the Number of Pole Pairs 
As the cage rotor adopts itself to any number of pole pairs, the synchronous speed 
(no-load speed) 
0

n
f
p
=
 can be varied in discrete steps by changing the number 
of pole pairs p. For this the stator 
• can be equipped with several separated three-phase windings, placed in the 
same slots (high effort, small utilization) or 
• contains a single winding with switchable winding segments (see Fig. 4.37). 
The pole switching is used for example in the so-called “Dahlander circuit“.

4.6 Star-Delta-Switching 
When switching the induction machine with zero rotor speed to the mains the en-
tire stall (short-circuit) current flows. This is a multiple of the nominal current. As 
this means a high load to the machine, the starting current has to be limited. 
A possibility for limitation of this current is the introduction of series resistanc-
es to the rotor circuit, if a slip ring rotor is present (please refer to Sect. 4.3). 
This is not possible with cage rotors. Here, the voltage is decreased by means 
of a starting transformer (at high power) or by means of star-delta-switching (low 
and medium power).

4.7 Doubly-Fed Induction Machine 
The slip-ring rotor of an induction machine can be supplied with voltages having 
slip frequency (formerly the slip power was supplied by another machine set-up, 
today generally this is done using an inverter) (Fig. 4.38). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 4.38. Doubly-fed induction machine. 
Via the inverter additional power can be fed to or drawn from the rotor. Feed-
ing the power an operation above synchronous speed is reached, drawing the pow-
er an operation below synchronous speed is realized (for motor operation). 
Apart from the inverter losses this kind of speed control (nearly) is lossless. 
The advantage of this alternative is that the inverter has to be dimensioned only 
for the slip power. A typical application of this kind of speed control e.g. is in 
wind power plants (generator operation).

The advantage of this kind of speed control is that the inverter has to be dimen-
sioned only for the slip power. Therefore it is smaller than an inverter supplying 
the machine on the stator side. 
A disadvantage of this alternative of speed control is that only a limited speed 
variation can be reached (the larger the speed variation, the larger is the required 
power of the inverter) and that the machine has to be equipped with slip rings. 
This pays off only for large power machines (typically more than 500kW). 
Designing the machine-side converter as a pure rectifier, it is only possible to 
draw power from the machine. Consequently, only the speed area below synchro-
nous speed is reachable with the advantage that the power electronic complexity

5 Synchronous Machines 
5.1 Equivalent Circuit and Phasor Diagram 
Like the induction machine the synchronous machine contains a stator with three-
phase winding (it is a rotating field machine), but the rotor winding is supplied 
with DC-current. In the following the voltage equations and the equivalent circuit 
of the synchronous machine will be derived from those of the induction machine. 
The three-phase winding of the stator is supplied from a three-phase mains with 
constant voltage 
1
U  and constant frequency 1f . The rotor shall have a three-phase 
winding of the same pole number as well, which is connected to slip rings. Be-
tween two of these slip rings a DC-current is fed (excitation or field current 
FI ). 
Therefore, the frequency of the rotor currents is 2f
0
=
. 
According to the rotating field theory the synchronous machine is only able to 
produce a torque that is constant in time and different from zero, if the frequency 
condition is fulfilled:

Consequently, in stationary operating conditions the rotor always rotates with 
the synchronous speed 
0
n . At any different speed

 an oscillating torque 
with a mean value according to time equal to zero is generated. 
In contrary to the induction machine, which does not generate a torque for 
0
n
n
=
, the synchronous machine generates a torque only at 
0
n
n
=
. 
Now, coming from the general circuit diagram of the induction machine with 
slip ring rotor, the circuit diagram of the synchronous machine will be deduced. 
Here the “energy generation system” is applied, because synchronous machines 
mainly are used as generators (Fig. 5.1).

From the voltage equation of the stator the circuit diagram of the synchronous 
machine can be deduced. The rotor part must not be considered separately, be-
cause the voltage 
P
U  induced from the excitation field into the stator winding is 
already included and in stationary operating points there is no reaction from the 
stator to the rotor. In Fig. 5.3 the directions of 
1
U  and 
 1
I  are reversed against the 
beginning of this chapter. Therefore, even here the “energy generation system” is 
used.

5.2.1 Overview 
Synchronous machines have the same stator construction like induction machines: 
A three-phase winding is placed in the slots of the lamination stack. For the rotor

5.2.2 High-Speed Generator with Cylindrical Rotor 
If synchronous generators are driven by steam or gas turbines (thermal power sta-
tion) the speed is chosen as high as possible to reach an as good as possible tur-
bine efficiency. For a mains frequency of 50Hz  the maximum speed is 
1
3000 min− (2-pole construction, i.e. p
1
= ). The rotor diameter is limited by the 
accelerating forces. Because of the high mechanical stress the rotor construction is 
chosen being cylindrical. The volume required for the desired power is achieved 
by using a quite long rotor. 
5.2.3 Salient-Pole Generator 
The turbines of hydroelectric power stations rotate at very low speed 
(
1
100
750 min−
"
). To adapt this speed to the mains frequency the number of pole 
pairs have to be chosen very large ( p
30
4
=
"
). As the acceleration forces are 
low (because of the low speed) single poles with concentric excitation coils may 
be realized. The salient-pole synchronous generator has a large diameter and a 
short axial length. Using this construction type the air-gap is not constant at the 
circumference of the rotor, i.e. the magnetic reluctance varies at the circumfer-
ence. 
5.3 Operation at Fixed Mains Supply 
5.3.1 Switching to the Mains 
The synchronous machine may only be switched to the mains with constant volt-
age and frequency (Fig. 5.8), if the following conditions for synchronization are 
fulfilled: 
• The synchronous machine is rotated by a driving motor with synchronous 
speed: 
0
n
n
=
. 
• The excitation current 
FI  of the synchronous machine is adjusted so that the 
generator voltage is equal to the mains voltage: 
gen
line
U
U
=
. 

5.3 Operation at Fixed Mains Supply      197 
• The phase sequence of the terminal voltages of generator and mains have to be 
the same: abc – uvw. 
• The phase shift of the voltage systems of generator and mains must be identi-
cal, i.e. the voltage difference at the terminals that shall be connected must be 
zero: U
0
Δ
=
. 
If these conditions for synchronization are not fulfilled, there are very high 
torque and current pulsations after switching the generator to the mains.

: In-
creasing the load slowly, the torque and the rotor angle ϑ  are increased as well, 
until the synchronous machines reaches the pull-out torque at 
2
ϑ = ± π
 and the 
machine falls out of synchronism. As a motor the machine stops, as a generator it 
runs away. High oscillating torque components do occur, combined with high cur-
rents pulses. In this case the synchronous machine has to be disconnected from the 
mains immediately. 
These characteristics are illustrated in Fig. 5.11.

ering reactive power when being over-excited, consuming reactive power when 
being under-excited). This is illustrated in Fig. 5.13; the phasors belonging to dif-

5.4 Isolated Operation      205 
5.4 Isolated Operation 
5.4.1 Load Characteristics 
Having a single synchronous machine as a generator connected with some loads, 
this is called “isolated operation”. Typically, such an operation is used where a 
connection to the grid would require very long distances and therefore would im-
ply unreasonable high costs. Frequently, synchronous machines in isolated opera-
tion are driven by wind or hydroelectric power stations. 
Contrary to the previous considerations, no stable grid can be assumed any 
more, but the voltage at the terminals of the generator changes with the load (even 
with constant excitation current). 
At first, the well-known phasor diagram of the synchronous machine (Fig. 
5.16) can be taken as a basis:

5.4.2 Control Characteristics 
Even in isolated operation the loads should be connected to a constant voltage 
source, independent from the load current. Therefore, the excitation current has to 
be controlled in dependency of the load (amplitude and phase shift of the load cur-
rent). From the phasor diagram (Fig. 5.16) it follows with the requirement

With this the so-called control characteristics (excitation current

For resistive-inductive loads the excitation current has to be increased to fix the 
terminal voltage to the nominal voltage at increasing load; for purely capacitive 
loads the excitation current has to be decreased (for resistive-capacitive loads with 
phase angles less than 30

 the excitation current maybe has to be in-

5.5 Salient-Pole Synchronous Machines 
Because of the distinct single poles the air-gap on the circumference of the salient-
pole machine is not constant (contrary to the induction machine or the non salient-
pole synchronous machine). Therefore, a simple summation of the rotating magne-
to-motive forces of stator and rotor is not allowed to get the resulting air-gap field. 
In fact, the magneto-motive force of the stator has to be decomposed in two com-
ponents, one in parallel to the rotor pole axis (d-axis, direct axis), and the other 
perpendicular to the rotor pole axis (q-axis, quadrature axis):

By decomposing the magneto-motive force of the stator into the components, 
the armature reaction is determined separately for d- and q-direction and the result 
is superposed. 
Thus, from the original system with three stator phases a two-phase system is 
generated as a replacement, see Fig. 5.22.

ment (above right) and two-phase replacement (below). 
The main reactances (synchronous reactances) 
d
X  and 
q
X  can be measured: 
For this the stator winding is energized and the rotor – with open excitation wind-
ing – is driven with nearly synchronous speed. Because of the small slip between 
rotating field of the stator and the rotor the respective axes are alternately coinci-
dent or perpendicular. From the ratio of the oscillographically measured phase 
voltage and phase current the reactance can be calculated; this reactance is oscil-
lating between the extreme values 
d
X  and 
q
X . 
Performing this measurement with a single phase at stand-still, the result will 
be falsified because of the short-circuited damper winding and the eddy currents in 
the massive iron parts. The measured values will be too small.

The first summand corresponds to the torque of the non salient-pole synchro-
nous machine which is excitation-dependent, the second summand is the so-called 
reaction torque which is excitation-independent (caused by the difference of the 
magnetic reluctances in d- and q-axis). Because of this reaction torque the pull-out 
torque of the salient-pole synchronous machine is reached at smaller rotor angles 
than

π
, please refer to Fig. 5.23. Moreover, it can be deduced from that figure, 
that the salient-pole machine – because of the additional reaction torque – delivers 
a higher pull-out torque than the non salient-pole machine, compared at the same 
excitation current (assuming

6 Permanent Magnet Excited Rotating Field 
Machines 
6.1 Rotor Construction 
Having a synchronous machine and substituting the DC excitation current (which 
generates a constant magnetic field according to time) by an excitation with per-
manent magnets, the following is saved 
• voltage source for the excitation current, 
• excitation winding and 
• excitation current supply via slip rings and brushes. 
However, the excitation field is no longer controllable. Figure 6.1 illustrates 
different alternatives for the positioning of the permanent magnets (surface 
mounted permanent magnet machines, also called SPM or SMPM machines and 
interior permanent magnet machines, also called IPM machines, which carry the 
permanent magnets inside the rotor iron).

220      6 Permanent Magnet Excited Rotating Field Machines 
6.2 Linestart-Motor 
Incorporating a starting cage into such a permanent magnet synchronous machine, 
it is called “linestart-motor“: The motor is supplied directly from the line voltage, 
the speed-up is realized as an induction motor. Near to the synchronous speed the 
rotor is synchronized to the rotating field. Then the machine operates as synchro-
nous motor at the line. 
The advantages of self-starting, good power factor, and high efficiency during 
operation are opposed by a small utilization (because of the combination of two 
different machine types in the rotor). In addition, during starting operation the 
permanent magnets produce considerable torque pulsations as the frequencies of 
the magneto-motive force waves are not identical (please refer to Sect. 3.7). Ap-
plications for such linestart-motors are drives with very long operation duration 
and small power (e.g. small pumps and blowers, etc.). 
6.3 Electronically Commutated Rotating Field Machine with 
Surface Mounted Magnets 
6.3.1 Fundamentals 
Again, the synchronous machine contains permanent magnets to generate the exci-
tation field, but now no starting cage is present. The machine is supplied by an in-
verter which realizes a sinusoidal three-phase current system. 
For explaining the operational behavior it is recommended to start with the 
simplified equivalent circuit of the synchronous machine (Sect. 5.1), but with the 
following changes: 
• The “energy consumption system” is applied, because mostly this machine type 
is used as a motor. 
• The stator resistance R will be considered, because neglecting (e.g. for motors 
with small power or operation at low frequency) often is not allowed. 
• In this chapter rotors with surface mounted magnets are regarded (so-called 
surface-mounted permanent magnet machines, SPM or SMPM machines). This 
means that the magnetically effective air-gap length is constant along the cir-
cumference, as permanent magnets have a relative permeability near to 1 (i.e. 
near to the value of air). Therefore, the inductivities in d- and q-direction are 
the same and they do not have to be distinguished. 

6.3 Electronically Commutated Rotating Field Machine with Surface Mounted Magnets      221 
The equivalent circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 6.2.7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 6.2. Equivalent circuit diagram of the permanent magnet excited rotating field machine. 
The fundamental frequency of the supplying three-phase system determines the 
frequency of the rotating magneto-motive force and therefore even the rotor speed. 
The rotating magneto-motive force together with the field of the permanent mag-
net rotor generates the torque. Mostly, this torque shall be as smooth as possible. 
The rotation of the rotating stator field is realized depending on the rotor position 
by means of the inverter in such a way, that the electrical angle between rotating 
magneto-motive force of the stator and the rotor field is 
2
π
 (i.e. ϑ = −ϕ ). With 
this

sors or it can be deduced from the terminal voltages and/or terminal currents. The 
explained operation is described by the phasor diagram (see Fig. 6.3).

222      6 Permanent Magnet Excited Rotating Field Machines 
As this machine type mostly is used as a motor, the relations are given here for 
the “energy consumption system“. 
An operation is obtained that does no longer correspond to the synchronous 
machine, but to the DC-machine: 
• DC-machine: magneto-motive force of the armature and excitation field build 
an electrical angle of 
2
π
; this adjustment is realized mechanically by means 
of the commutator. 
• Synchronous machine: the rotor angle ϑ  and the phase angle ϕ  are adjusted 
depending on the operation point; there is no active influence on the phase shift 
between magneto-motive force of the stator and excitation field. 
• Electronically commutated permanent magnet excited rotating field machine: 
magneto-motive force of the stator and rotor field build an electrical angle of 
2
π
; this adjustment is realized electronically by means of the inverter. 
This machine topology shows very good dynamics and the control is quite sim-
ple. The brushless technology is wear-resistant and maintenance-free. This kind of 
motor often is used for machine tool drives and for robot drives.

To achieve good operational characteristics as a motor (generally the torque 
should be as smooth as possible), the permanent magnet field, the stator winding 
and the motor supply have to be adjusted to each other very carefully. Some ex-
amples are given in the next sections. 
6.3.2 Brushless DC-Motor 
Firstly, a motor without short-pitch winding (i.e. a motor with diameter winding) 
and a two-pole ( p
1
= ), radially magnetized permanent magnet ring is regarded. 

6.3 Electronically Commutated Rotating Field Machine with Surface Mounted Magnets      223 
The three phases of the motor (usually in star connection) are supplied from a 
three-phase inverter (illustrated by the six switches in Fig. 6.4). The electrical 
power is drawn from the DC-voltage

The characteristics of flux linkage, change of flux linkage, current, and torque 
are shown in Fig. 6.5. It can be deduced that the chosen current characteristics 
lead to an ideally smooth torque characteristic.  
Because of the kind of operation, which is similar to the operation of a DC-
motor, and because of the sectional DC-characteristic of the currents (which is the 
same as for DC-motors), the names of this kind of motor (together with the kind of 
operation) are derived: 
• electronically commutated DC-motor (sometimes referred to as EC-motor); 
• brushless DC-motor, BLDC-motor (which is most common).

6.3 Electronically Commutated Rotating Field Machine with Surface Mounted Magnets      225 
It can be deduced that for square-wave currents only two phases are energized 
at the same time. This current waveform is optimally adapted to the radial magnet-
ization of the permanent magnets to achieve the smoothest possible torque charac-
teristic (when neglecting the slotting effect). 
It has to be emphasized here that the Eqs. (6.1) to (6.3) and the phasor diagram 
(Fig. 6.3) are only valid for sinusoidal voltages and currents. Nevertheless, the 
torque calculation according to Eq. (6.4) is valid for any time-dependency, please 
refer to Chap. 1. Therefore the shown characteristics in Fig. 6.5 are valid. 
However, to achieve a torque characteristic as smooth as possible the flux per 
phase characteristics of the brushless DC-motor may be different from the above 
shown functions outside of the power-on time of the respective phase currents. 
From this additional degree of freedom the possibility to choose the magnetization 
or the winding layout differently arises. 
For example the torque contribution of each phase and the entire torque remain 
unchanged, if the value of the derivative of the flux linkage of each phase is 
changed at the discontinuity of the flux linkage characteristic in a range of 
6
± π
 
(e.g. because of a gap between two poles or because of magnetic leakage between 
two poles). Therefore, trapezoidal flux linkage characteristics because of leakage 
together with ideal square-wave currents generate a constant torque, as long as the 
constant part of this trapezoidal characteristic is not less than the critical power-on 
time period of 2
3
π
. 
However, the practical realization of steep current slopes (square-wave cur-
rents) require especially in the middle and upper speed region with high induced 
back emf voltages a high voltage reserve of the inverter. This means an overdi-
mensioning of the inverter and consequently high costs. In addition, high acoustic 
noise is generated, which is not acceptable for many applications. Therefore, in 
many cases a deviation from the idealized square-wave current is accepted, which 
is accompanied by a higher torque oscillation, but even lower costs and lower 
acoustic noise. 
Another often used winding topology can be deduced from the above described 
diameter winding by incorporating an extreme short-pitch: the winding of a phase 
is concentrated onto one stator tooth; please refer to Fig. 6.6 for a four-pole motor. 
This winding topology contains two main advantages: 
• The conductor length in the end winding is extremely short; this means a low 
stator resistance as well as low copper weight. Consequently, cost and losses 
are reduced. 
• With a respective geometry of the lamination (e.g. stator teeth with parallel 
shoulders or separated lamination) the coils can be wound before and then 
mounted to the teeth. This reduces the manufacturing costs.

Fig. 6.6. Four-pole permanent magnet excited rotating field machine. 
Generally, using this concentrated winding means that the width of a rotor pole 
is larger than the width of a stator tooth. Therefore, the flux linkage characteristic 
is trapezoidal: for a part of the rotor rotation, always parts of 2
2
2
3

π

= π
 
electrical degrees, the flux in the stator coil is unchanged; this is different to the 
above example of the two-pole machine with diameter winding. 
In practice this extreme short-pitch winding is characterized by torque dips, be-
cause the parts with constant d
d
Ψ
α  are shortened and the magnetic leakage at 
the pole edges (transition between north and south pole) becomes more prominent. 
Flux linkage, change of flux linkage, current, and torque for this case are 
shown in Fig. 6.7 for idealized assumptions: 
To achieve a torque as smooth as possible even in practice the following means 
can be implemented:  
• skewing of the stator slots or the rotor poles (disadvantages: high costs, flux 
leakage); 
• distributed, short-pitch two-layer winding (disadvantage: high costs); 
• choosing a fractional number for the ratio of stator slots and rotor poles (disad-
vantage: for non-symmetric winding topologies there are radial forces onto the 
rotor); 
• sinusoidal flux linkage combined with sinusoidal currents (disadvantage: com-
plex current shaping).

6.3.3 Electronically Commutated Permanent Magnet Excited 
Synchronous Machine 
Operating the supplying inverter appropriately with high switching frequency (at 
low power the switching frequency for the voltage waveform generally is above 
the human threshold of hearing of about 20kHz ), the phase currents of the motor 
can be nearly sinusoidal because of the low-pass effect of the phase impedances. 
With this an artificial three-phase system with variable voltage and variable fre-
quency is realized. The permanent magnet excited synchronous machine supplied 
by such a frequency variable sinusoidal current system in literature often is re-
ferred to as “permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM)” or “brushless AC 
operation”. 
A motor construction that is adapted concerning winding topology and magnet 
design to this sinusoidal operation (to reach a smooth torque) is illustrated in Fig. 
6.8.

However, considering the magnetic leakage at the pole edges (transition be-
tween north and south poles with not perfectly shaped poles) the torque is not in-
creasing linearly with the number of pole pairs. With increasing number of pole 
pairs the leakage percentage (depending on the geometry) gets increasing rele-
vance and consequently there is an optimum at moderate numbers of pole pairs. 
6.4 Calculation of the Operational Characteristics; Permanent 
Magnet Excited Machines with Buried Magnets 
To calculate the operation conditions of the above described machines, it is possi-
ble using the “Rotating Field Theory” (Chap. 3) for the permanent magnet excited 
synchronous machine (PMSM), because this machine shows sinusoidal voltages 
and currents. However, this is not possible for the brushless DC-machine (BLDC), 
because this kind of operation makes step-by-step DC-currents necessary. As the 
machine topology of both alternatives can be described with the same equations 
(just the supply is different), the calculation of the operational characteristics shall 
be done using a theory where arbitrary current waveforms can be used. This theo-
ry is the “Space Vector Theory” dealt with in Chap. 11. Therefore, the operational 
characteristics of PMSM and BLDC will be described in the later Chap. 14. In this 
chapter even the possibility of buried magnets (see Sect. 6.1) is described.

7.1 Synchronous Reluctance Machines 
The torque of the salient-pole synchronous machine is composed of two parts; the

The advantages of such a machine are: 
• simple construction (no excitation winding, no slip rings, no brushes); 
• no (excitation) losses in the rotor. 
A challenge is the fact that the reachable torque is depending on the reactances 
in d- and q-axis: E.g. for 
d

 it had been calculated for the salient-pole 
synchronous machine (Sect. 5.5) that the reluctance torque was just half of the 
torque generated by the nominal excitation current. Another disadvantage is the 
poor power factor 
( )
cos ϕ  (see Sect. 5.5), so that an inverter with large power rat-
ing has to be used. 
Because of this synchronous reluctance machines have only relevance, if the 
difference of the reactances in d- and q-axis can be increased considerably (e.g. by 
proper rotor design with multiple flux barriers).

7.2 Switched Reluctance Machines 
7.2.1 Construction and Operation 
The construction of the switched reluctance machine (SR-machine, SRM) is sim-
ple, robust and cost-effective. The stator is composed of teeth (poles) with concen-
trated coils. Generally, opposite coils are representing a winding phase. The rotor 
contains teeth without windings, the number of rotor teeth is lower than the num-
ber of stator teeth. Figure 7.1 illustrates a switched reluctance motor with six sta-
tor poles (stator teeth) and four rotor teeth (6/4-motor). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 7.1. Principle construction of a 6/4 switched reluctance machine. 
The shown SRM has three phases. To rotate the rotor the stator phases have to 
be switched on and off cyclically depending on the actual rotor position. 
For moving the rotor clockwise (relative to the mechanical angle α  in negative 
direction), the phase with coils w-z has to be switched on next at the above pre-
sented motor. If in the following the rotor teeth are aligned to the stator teeth of 
this phase („aligned position“), it is not possible to generate further torque (in the 
desired direction) with this phase. It has to be switched off and the phase with 
coils u-x will be switched on. After accordant rotation of the rotor, this phase will 
be switched off and the phase with coils v-y will be switched on. Then the rotor 
moves further until it reaches the above presented position; here this phase will be 
switched off again and the phase with coils w-z will be switched on. 
For knowing the actual rotor position it must be measured: directly via sensors 
or indirectly via the terminal values (current and voltage).

From the described operation of the SRM it becomes obvious that the rotor 
moves in opposite direction to the rotating field (energizing the stator phases in 
anti-clockwise direction a clockwise movement of the rotor is created). 
Having m stator phases and 2p  stator poles per phase, the number of stator 
teeth is:

slowlier than the rotating stator field. Therefore, depending on the application a 
speed reduction gear-set can be omitted because of the motor design. However, 
the switching frequency has to be accordingly larger, if the speed of the SRM 
should be as high as for a motor rotating in synchronism with the rotating field.

. For this number of rotor teeth 
the rotor moves in the same direction like the rotating stator field. Generally, such variants are 
not used, because the mechanical construction is less robust and the frequency is higher for a cer-
tain speed. Therefore, in the following these alternatives are not regarded further.

Consequently, the torque of a single phase is obtained from the partial differen-
tiation of the magnetic co-energy of the regarded phase with respect to the rotor 
position angle. The torque of the entire machine is calculated by summation of all 
phase torques. 
The magnetic co-energy has a very important relevance:

the following can be deduced: 
• The torque is proportional to the squared current. This means that the current 
direction (sign “+“ or “-“) has no influence on the direction of the torque (this 
corresponds to the general experience: an iron object is attracted from an (elec-
tro-) magnet independent from the polarity of the magnet). 

238      7 Reluctance Machines 
• The torque increases the higher the difference in inductivity between “aligned 
position” and “unaligned position” is (i.e. dependent on the rotor position). 
Therefore, the switched reluctance machine in contrary to induction machines, 
synchronous machines or brushless DC-machines can be operated with unipolar 
currents. 
The torque as change of the magnetic co-energy with respect to the rotational 
angle can be deduced from the 
i
ψ −−diagram. Because of the different inductivi-
ties in the “aligned position“ and the “unaligned position“ different characteristics 
are obtained (Fig. 7.3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 7.3 Torque of the switched reluctance machine without saturation. 
Operating the machine in the unsaturated region a torque per switch-on period 
of a single stator tooth is generated that corresponds to the shaded co-energy area 
in Fig. 7.3. 
In contrast, operating the machine far in saturation (in the “aligned position“), a 
far higher torque is achievable (this can be deduced from the considerably larger 
co-energy area per switch-on period, see Fig. 7.4):

In this idealized presentation the co-energy area is limited on the right by a ver-
tical line, because generally the phase current is limited (either thermally or by the 
supplying inverter). 
Only in the operation mode with high saturation the switched reluctance motor 
is comparable to the induction motor in terms of torque density. For the exact cal-
culation of the torque numerical methods (e.g. finite element method, FEM) are 
required because of the non-linearity coming from high saturation. 
7.2.3 Modes of Operation 
The torque-speed-plane of the switched reluctance machine can be separated into 
two main areas: pulsed operation and block-mode operation. 
• During pulsed operation a speed-independent maximum torque can be generat-
ed; this area corresponds to the armature control range (base speed range) of 
the induction machine. Here the inverter has to be pulsed with high frequency, 
so that the phase current remains within its limits. Because of this active con-
trol an as far as possible square-wave current will be adjusted. 
• In block-mode operation the phase current will only be switched on and off 
once per period; the phase current is not adjusted actively. With this the maxi-
mum possible torque is about proportional to 1/ n . Increasing the speed further 
– and therefore it is necessary to switch off the respective phase during current 
increase – the maximum possible torque decreases about 
2
1/ n . 
Figure 7.5 illustrates these operation modes schematically; especially the tran-
sition from pulsed operation to block-mode operation is not at a certain point, but 
it is variable and depends on many parameters (e.g. torque level, resistance, volt-
age source, etc.).

The pulsed operation will be explained in the following by means of a single 
phase. Each phase of the machine is connected via two power transistors (shown 
as simple switches in Fig. 7.6) and two power diodes as a half bridge. The differ-
ent switching states are illustrated in Fig. 7.6, where the machine phase is symbol-
ized as an inductivity.

Neglecting the voltage drops across the transistors and diodes, in case a) of Fig. 
7.6 the voltage

 supplies the phase winding; the current increases in the 
shown direction. 
If the phase current exceeds the desired current 
Hi
I
 by a specific amount, both 
transistors T1 and T2 are opened and the voltage 
DC
U
 supplies the phase winding 
in opposite direction to case a): In this case b) of Fig. 7.6 the current decreases un-
til a certain value below the desired current is reached. At this point in time it is 
switched back to case a). 
The current and voltage characteristics (Fig. 7.7) show these time-dependent 
functions (so-called “hard chopping“) including the magnetizing and demagnetiz-
ing of the phase. 
If the current does not reach the desired value, the voltage will be switched on 
at the rotor position angle 
on
α
 (case a)) and switched off at the rotor position an-
gle 
off
α
 (case b)). Then block-mode operation is active. At the rotor position an-

During the pulsed operation there are high switching losses because of the high 
switching frequencies of the power transistors. To avoid this, per switching period 
only one of both power transistors is switched and for the following switching pe-
riod the other power transistor is switched (in Fig. 7.6 in case c) the switching of 
the power transistor T1 is shown as an example). The current and voltage charac-
teristics for this so-called “soft chopping“ look like it is shown in Fig. 7.9.

7.2.4 Alternative Power Electronic Circuits 
The inverter already shown in Fig. 7.6 for one phase is called 2n inverter, because 
it contains 2n switchable power electronic devices, if the number of phases is 
called n (see Fig. 7.10 for a four-phase machine). 
This configuration has the advantage of being most flexible concerning current 
waveforms, but there is even the disadvantage of a large number of power elec-
tronic devices, resulting in high costs.

This circuit can be simplified by far, if the so-called n+1 inverter is used. This 
inverter (see Fig. 7.11) is characterized by one low-side power electronic switch 
that may switch at low frequency and just selects the phase of the machine that 
shall be energized. In addition, there is one single high-side switch for all phases 
together, being responsible for high-frequency PWM switching. This alternative 
reduces the effort concerning number of power electronic switches and their ac-
companied driving circuit and concerning the quality of most of the switches (just 
one power electronic device has to be capable to switch at high PWM frequency). 
On the other hand, this circuit has the disadvantage that the phases cannot be 
switched independently, which decreases the degree of freedom for machine con-
trol.

A compromise between low effort and high degree of freedom is the so-called 
n+2 inverter. Here, the phases of the machine are organized in two groups, so that 
two phases may be energized simultaneously, see Fig. 7.12.

7.2.5 Main Characteristics 
The main positive characteristics of switched reluctance machines are: 
• The construction is simple, robust, and cost-effective. 
• Heating because of Ohmic losses only does occur in the stator (and there good 
possibilities for cooling exist). 
• Short-term overload is no problem for the SRM. 
• The rotor has low inertia and it is robust; therefore it is qualified for high-speed 
applications. 
• The torque is independent from the current direction; consequently simple elec-
tronic circuits for the inverter may be used. 
The main disadvantages are: 
• The actually energized coil has to be switched off at high phase current and 
maximum stored energy: Therefore, the inverter usage is relatively low. 
• To achieve a high difference in inductivity between the “aligned position“ and 
the “unaligned position“ the air-gap width in the “aligned position“ has to be 
very small. This increases the costs and it makes the SRM sensitive to produc-
tion tolerances. 
• The torque is pulsating. To smooth it, e.g. the number of phases can be in-
creased or the teeth (reasonably the rotor teeth, as these do not carry windings) 
can be skewed. Both measures increase the costs and decrease the utilization. 
• Because of the high difference in inductivity between the “aligned position“ 
and the “unaligned position“ high pulsating radial forces occur. These forces 
are the reason for serious acoustic noise. 
• By influencing the current waveform the torque and/or the acoustic noise can 
be influenced. To do so, generally a voltage reserve is necessary and the utiliza-
tion is reduced. 
• In analogy to induction machines, a reactive current component is necessary for 
the magnetization of the machine. With this reactive current component the ap-
parent power of the inverter is increased.

8 Small Machines for Single-Phase Operation 
8.1 Fundamentals 
The generation of electrical energy, its distribution and its industrial application 
for high-power drives is done by means of three-phase systems with high voltage. 
For this, three-phase machines are used that produce a torque that is constant in 
time. 
At the low-voltage level for low power in households mostly there is just a sin-
gle-phase system available. For such applications, single-phase machines have to 
be used. The construction of such single-phase machines often deviates signifi-
cantly from high-power machines, because: 
• inherent to their functional principle they are non-symmetric, 
• often they have to be integrated into the application and  
• concessions to manufacturing needs of the (usually existing) high-volume pro-
duction have to be made. 
There is a steadily growing market for these kinds of machines and their eco-
nomic relevance is increasing. Main importance for the direct connection to the 
single-phase mains have the universal motor and the single-phase induction ma-
chine. 
In addition, more and more BLDC-machines with inverter supply are used with 
the single-phase mains. Because of the electronic supply these machine are able to 
draw a constant power from the mains and to deliver a constant power (torque) to 
the application. 
8.2 Universal Motor 
Fundamentally, the construction of the universal motor is like the DC-motor, but it 
has a laminated stator. It can be operated by DC currents and AC currents, hence 
the name comes from. For operation with AC currents of the frequency f  the 
main equations of the DC-machine in their time-dependent formulation are valid.

Consequently, the torque is composed of two components (see Fig. 8.1): 
• a constant component, which is proportional to the cosine of the angle ρ  (the 
phase shift between flux and current) and 
• an alternating component, that oscillates with the double mains frequency.

The requirement mentioned above (

) is fulfilled only for the series-
wound machine. The ripple torque is damped by the inertias of the rotor and the 
load, so that in steady-state operation there are only minimal speed variations. The 
useful torque is the mean value of the torque (constant component). 
Compared to the DC-motor the universal motor delivers a lower torque when 
operated by AC voltage (if the DC voltage is equal to the rms-value of the AC 
voltage), because there is an additional voltage drop at the reactance X
L

the qualitative speed-torque-characteristics in Fig. 8.3).

8.3 Single-Phase Induction Machine 
8.3.1 Single-Phase Operation of Three-Phase Induction Machine 
Disconnecting one phase of the three-phase induction machine from the symmet-
ric three-phase mains, a single-phase supply at two phases of the machine is ob-
tained. The stator MMF produces an alternating air-gap field, which – according 
to the “Rotating Field Theory” (Chap. 3) – can be regarded as being composed of 
two rotating fields travelling in opposite direction and having half the amplitude. 
That field component travelling in the same direction like the rotor (defined as 
positive direction, index “p”) induces voltages into the rotor windings, that pro-
duce the currents

nent coming from the positive rotating stator field together with the negative rotat-
ing rotor MMF and the torque component coming from the negative rotating stator 
field together with the positive rotating rotor MMF are oscillating torques with the 
mean value equal to zero. They do not deliver any useful torque. In addition there 
are the torque components of the positive and negative rotating stator fields, pro-
duced with their “own” (i.e. the self-induced) rotor currents. These two compo-
nents deliver a mean torque different from zero. 
At stand-still the rotor has the slip s

=
 to the positive rotating stator field as 
well as to the negative rotating stator field. The torque components from both ro-
tating fields have the same amplitude, but opposite direction. The motor does not 
accelerate. 
If the rotor rotates in one direction, there are different slip values for 
ps  and 
ns . Consequently, the reaction of the squirrel-cage rotor onto both rotating stator 
MMFs is different. The negative rotating field is strongly damped at

 is exposed only to a small reaction. Therefore, an 
elliptical rotating air-gap field is generated, which results in producing a useful 
torque in the direction of rotor rotation. Consequently, this means: The three-
phase induction machine rotates further, if one phase is disconnected from the 
mains and the load torque is not too high (but the slip will increase and therefore 
the efficiency will decrease, see the torque-speed-characteristics in Fig. 8.5). By 
mechanical starting the rotor from zero speed, the motor can accelerate further. 
A detailed calculation can be performed by means of the symmetric compo-
nents (see Sect. 1.6). The resulting torque-speed-characteristic is identical to that 
of two three-phase induction motors connected in series, which rotors are mechan-
ically coupled and which stators are supplied with opposite phase sequence at 
3  
times the phase voltage. The qualitative torque-speed-characteristics look like it is 
shown in Fig. 8.5.

8.3.2 Single-Phase Induction Motor with Auxiliary Phase 
If the induction motor in single-phase operation shall deliver a torque even at zero 
speed, at least an elliptical rotating air-gap field has to be present at stand-still. 
This can be realized by means of an auxiliary winding “a”, that is shifted against 
the main winding “m” by a spatial angle ε  and that is supplied by a current with a 
phase shift by an (electrical) angle ϕ . 
If p
0
ε = ϕ =
 holds true, a purely oscillating air-gap field is obtained. If 
p
2
ε = ϕ = π
 holds, the amplitude of the negative rotating field is minimal and 
the amplitude of the positive rotating field is maximal. The phase shift between 
the current 
m
I  of the main winding and the current 
aI  of the auxiliary winding is 
realized by an additional impedance in the auxiliary winding, like it is shown in 
the equivalent circuit diagram in Fig. 8.6. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 8.6. Equivalent circuit diagram of the single-phase induction motor with auxiliary phase. 
There are three possibilities for this impedance in the auxiliary winding: 
• Resistance: A resistance is very cost-effective, but only a small starting torque 
is generated; because of the losses it has to be switched off after starting the 
motor.  
• Inductivity: An inductivity delivers only a small starting torque (a pure induc-
tivity produces no phase shift of the current; only because of the unavoidable 
resistance there is a generally small phase shift); in addition the inductivity is 
costly and heavy. 
• Capacity: Starting capacity (switching off by centrifugal switch) or operating 
capacity (improvement of power factor and efficiency); the use of a capacity 
results in a high starting torque, from technical point of view this is the best so-
lution.

8.3.3 Shaded-Pole (Split-Pole) Motor 
The shaded-pole motor is a special case of the single-phase induction motor with 
auxiliary winding: The main winding is located on two salient poles and contains 
concentrated coils. It is supplied from the single-phase mains. The auxiliary wind-
ing is realized as a short-circuited ring that encloses only a part of the salient pole. 
It is supplied by means of induction from the main winding. The rotor is a squir-
rel-cage rotor. A principle sketch is shown in Fig. 8.7. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 8.7. Principle sketch of a shaded-pole motor. 
Only by means of the resistance 
a
R  of the auxiliary winding the phase shift of 
the currents of main and auxiliary winding is realized. As there is even a spatial 
shift of the windings, an elliptical rotating air-gap field is generated. Therefore, 
this motor can start from stand-still. As the field of the main winding is preceding 
the field of the auxiliary winding (the short-circuited ring delays the change of the 
field) the rotor always moves from the main pole to the auxiliary pole. 
In many cases the short-circuited ring is made from bronze and not from copper 
to increase the resistance 
a
R . 
Because of the losses in the short-circuited ring and because of the opposite ro-
tating field, shaded-pole machines have a quite low efficiency of about 20 to 40%. 
The starting torque is lower and the starting current is higher compared to the mo-
tor with capacity in the auxiliary phase. Therefore, in spite of being simple and 
very cost-effective the shaded-pole motor is used only for small power applica-
tions up to about 100W.

9.5 Slow Speed Change 
9.5.1 Fundamentals 
From the equation of motion (Eq. (9.21)) the mechanical transient operation of a 
drive can be calculated, if the torque characteristics as function of time or angular 
frequency are known. 
The torque of the electric machine can be calculated by means of the system 
equations of the electromagnetic circuits. The phase currents of the machine are 
determined even by the equation of motion. Therefore, generally there is a cou-
pling between the electrical and mechanical transient behavior (dynamic opera-
tion).  
This coupling can be neglected, if the operation is a quasi steady-state one. 
Such an operation is characterized by slow speed changes (compared to the elec-
trical time constants). Then the steady-state characteristics 
( )
T ω  and 
( )
load
T
ω  
can be used. 
9.5.2 First Example 
A constant acceleration torque 
a

 is assumed (i.e. the electrical machine 
always produces a torque that is constantly higher than the load torque). It follows: 
 
a
T
d
dt
ω =
Θ
 
(9.27) 
For the acceleration the following holds true: 
 
a
T t
ω =
Θ
 
(9.28) 
Consequently, there is a linear speed increase with time. Dividing this equation 
by the final angular frequency 
0
ω  it follows:

a

T
ω Θ
ω =

(9.29) 

9.5 Slow Speed Change      265 
If the acceleration torque is equal to the nominal torque (
a
N
T
T
=
) and the final 
angular frequency is equal to its nominal value (
0

ω = ω
), the mechanical time 
constant becomes:

Consequently, the rotor heat losses during run-up are identical to the kinetic

Having the same final kinetic energy like for the run-up without changing the 
number of poles (because the final speed is not changed), there are only half the 
losses in the rotor (and therefore there is considerably reduced rotor heating).

The differential equations of the armature circuit and the torque are coupled by 
the speed

I . 
The inductivity of the field winding is assumed being dependent on the current, 
whereas the inductivity of the armature winding is assumed being constant. This 
assumption of constant armature inductivity is valid, because the armature circuit 
proceeds perpendicular to the main pole axis and here either a large air-gap is 
dominating or just a small leakage inductivity is present if commutation poles 
and / or compensation windings are used.

10.2 Separately Excited DC-Machines 
10.2.1 General Structure 
Speed-variable DC-machines are often operated with constant excitation (constant 
field e.g. by means of permanent magnets). Then torque and speed are adjusted by 
varying the armature voltage. In this case 
N
const.
φ = φ
=
 is valid and the block 
diagram (Fig. 10.4) gets quite simple by

.

By means of the Laplace transformation the representation as block diagram 
usually used in control engineering is deduced (Fig. 10.5).

Output value is the speed of the DC-machine, which is controlled by the set-
point (armature voltage). The disturbance quantity is the load torque.

10.2.2 Response to Setpoint Changes 
“Response to setpoint changes” is called the change of the output value because of 
a variation of the input (setpoint), when the disturbance is equal to zero. 
Therefore, the response to setpoint changes of the DC-machine is the speed 
change when changing the armature voltage for

For

 aperiodic characteristics are obtained when changing the 
armature voltage or the load torque. The case D
1
=  is called “critical damping”. 
10.3 Shunt-Wound DC-Machines 
For DC-machines with variable exciting flux φ  the investigation of dynamic op-
eration has to be performed by numerical calculation, because the set of differen-
tial equations is nonlinear and cannot be solved analytically. Such a case is present 
e.g. for starting the shunt-wound DC-machine. 
At the time t
0
=
 the machine at standstill shall be switched to the mains. Dur-
ing the entire run-up the machine is unloaded (
load
T
0
=

The steep increase of the armature current and the slow increase of the field ex-
citing current lead to a reduced torque during acceleration. Because of

 (see Sect. 10.2, “separately excited DC-machine“) aperiodic 
characteristics would be expected initially, but the speed and the armature current 
show overshooting characteristics. The reason for this difference between the sep-
arately excited DC-machine and the shunt-wound DC-machine is: 
• For the separately excited DC-machine the flux always is constant at its nomi-
nal value, i.e. for all times

• The field of the shunt-wound DC-machine is increased during starting, i.e. the 
nominal value is reached delayed. 
10.4 Cascaded Control of DC-Machines 
For control purposes in the electrical drive engineering often PI- (proportional-
integral-) controllers are used. In addition to a simple structure they have the ad-
vantage of stationary preciseness (i.e. after disturbances the initial value is reached 
again, after change of setpoint the new value is reached, both without any station-
ary difference). 
Block diagram and transfer function of a PI-controller are shown in Fig. 10.12:

Figure 10.14 shows the time-dependent characteristics of speed (solid blue line) 
and armature current (solid red line) together with their respective set values (dot-
ted lines) for a step function of the speed set value from 0 to 1 and later to -1 
(starting and reversing) without any load. In this case the armature current is lim-
ited to the double nominal value. Because of the constant excitation the armature 
current (in normalized representation) is identical to the torque. From the over-
shootings and oscillations can be deduced that the parameters of the controllers are 
not adjusted optimally (concerning oscillations, speed adjustment, and precise-
ness).

10.5.4 Application of the Adjusting Rules to the Cascaded Control 
of DC-Machines 
Applying the rules of optimal response to setpoint changes (“optimum of magni-
tude”) to the current controller and to the speed controller of the cascaded control 
(see Sect. 10.4) the following results are obtained (Fig. 10.18). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 10.18. Characteristics of the separately excited DC-machine in cascaded control operation 
when applying the rules of optimal response to setpoint changes. 
In this case, the “optimum of magnitude” is applied to both controllers, because 
speed and current are exposed to changing setpoints. For the current controller this 
is the usual case, for the speed controller sometimes even the “symmetrical opti-
mum” rule is applied. This is the case if not changing setpoints, but changing load 
torques have to be controlled. 
From Fig. 10.18 it can be deduced that the armature current follows its set val-
ue quite precisely, i.e. the adjusting rule “optimum of magnitude” works very 
good. Between the speed and its set value there is quite a large deviation. This 
comes from the fact, that the structure analyzed for the adjusting rules is just an 
approximation to the speed control loop. Nevertheless, compared to the results 
shown in Fig. 10.14, the control behavior is improved by far.  
By varying the control parameters even a better performance will be achieva-
ble.

11 Space Vector Theory 
11.1 Methods for Field Calculation 
For the description and calculation of electro-magnetic fields in electrical ma-
chines mainly the following four methods are used: 
1. The wave-description of the electro-magnetic fields (see Sects. 3.3 to 3.5) has 
proven its value if stationary characteristics are to be calculated. This method 
may be used for the fundamental-wave characteristics of electrical machines, 
but it may be even used if additionally to the fundamental wave higher harmon-
ics are to be considered. E.g. this is the case if harmonic torque components 
(torque oscillations) or acoustic noise shall be computed. 
2. The symmetric components (please refer to Sect. 1.6) are mainly used for the 
examination of asymmetric events with constant frequency (this may be even 
transient reactions). 
3. The usage of complex space vectors is advantageous if the transient characteris-
tics of (controlled or uncontrolled) electrical drives are regarded. This method 
will be explained in the following sections. 
4. When using the Finite Element Method (FEM) the electrical machine is divided 
in many small parts (“finite elements”) and the electro-magnetic behavior of 
the machine is calculated numerically for each of these elements and for each 
operating point: The Maxwell’s equations are solved in each element and the 
solutions are adapted to each other at the element borders. The disadvantages of 
this method are on the one hand a quite high computation time, on the other 
hand it is more suited for the analysis of a known machine than for the design 
of a new one (the relevance of different influencing factors on the machine 
characteristics cannot be directly observed). The main advantage of this method 
is that virtually all relevant attributes can be considered simultaneously, where-
as for the other three mentioned (analytical) methods always limiting con-
straints have to be regarded. 
As can be seen from the above description of the different methods the choice 
of the suitable alternative depends on the task that has to be solved.

298      11 Space Vector Theory 
11.2 Requirements for the Application of the Space Vector 
Theory 
For the following considerations some limiting assumptions are made: 
1. Each phase winding of stator and rotor produce a sinusoidal magneto-motive 
force in space, all of the same wave length. This means a limitation to the fun-
damental wave of the magneto-motive forces (and therefore even a limitation to 
the fundamental waves of current loading and air-gap flux density); the wind-
ing factors of all harmonic waves are assumed being zero. Each single wave 
can be represented by a vector; the location of the vector shows the instantane-
ous position of the maximum of the wave, the length of the vector represents 
this maximum value. 
2. Magnetically the machine is completely symmetric (i.e. constant air-gap along 
the circumference) and the influence of the slots is neglected. Within one ma-
chine part (stator or rotor) the self- and mutual-inductivities are independent 
from the rotor position. 
3. Partly, these requirements can be disclaimed: If stator or rotor contains two 
magnetically or electrically perpendicular preferred orientations, the space vec-
tor theory still can be applied if the coordinate system is fixed to the asymmet-
ric machine part. 
4. Saturation is neglected, i.e. the magnetic permeances are independent from the 
magneto-motive forces, and the magnetic voltage drop in iron is neglected 
(
Fe
μ
→∞); linear relationships do exist. Now (as a main advantage of the rep-
resentation of the waves by vectors) the common effect of the single waves can 
be calculated by vector addition.10 
It is important for understanding the space vector theory, that there is no limit-
ing requirement for the time-dependency of the single currents: The currents may 
have arbitrary time-dependency which even may be asymmetric (this is crucial for 
the calculation of transient characteristics). In spite of the arbitrary time-
dependency of the currents the magneto-motive force, the current loading, and the 
air-gap flux density generated by each single current are sinusoidal in space at 
every moment;11 this is realized by a clever winding distribution in the slots of the 
machine. 
In the following only the very important three-phase system is regarded. Never-
theless, the method of the complex space vector is applicable for arbitrary number 
of phases. 
                                                           
10 This requirement can be attenuated: It is sufficient, that there is a constant saturation condition 
inside the machine. By linearizing at the operation point the vector addition is still applicable. 
11 This gives a hint for the origin of the name “space vector theory”: main importance have the 
spatially sinusoidal waves inside the machine, there are no requirements to special time-
dependencies. 

11.3 Definition of the Complex Space Vector      299 
11.3 Definition of the Complex Space Vector 
The representation of the waves by means of vectors will now be transformed to a 
representation by means of complex numbers. For this, a complex plain is defined, 
where the real axis and the axis of the phase “u“ enclose a (time-dependent) angle

Now a complex number (called “space vector” in the following) is defined as 
follows (here shown for the example of the phase currents of a three-phase sys-
tem):12

12 In the following complex space vectors, for distinguishing them from other complex numbers, 
are identified by arrows under the variable. The calculation rules for complex numbers are valid 
even here; the arrows under the variable just label the special definition of these complex num-
bers. In literature even a simple underscore can be found to label complex space vectors. For sys-
tems with m  phases the space vector is: ( )

rent when having symmetric supply of all phases. To simplify the notation, in the 
following the explicit statement of the time-dependency of the angle α  is omitted.

sumption system, which becomes obvious from the signs in the used voltage equa-
tions (please refer to Sect. 1.2).  
Firstly, the three voltage equations of the (symmetric) system

11.5 Interpretation of the Space Vector Description      305 
For this derivation it is important that the linear combination of the three gener-
ally valid voltage equations requires no limitation concerning the spatial distribu-
tion of the fields or concerning the time-dependent functions of the currents. 
11.5 Interpretation of the Space Vector Description 
Like shown in the preceding sections, the space vector can be calculated from the 
values of the three phases or from the sum of real and imaginary part. With other 
words this means that the three-phase system can be transformed into a two-phase 
system, like it is schematically shown in Fig. 11.3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 11.3. Interpretation of the space vector description: three-phase system (left), two-phase sys-
tem (right). 
Additionally, by means of an arbitrary angle α  a transformation into a coordi-
nate system rotating with arbitrary angular frequency is successful: The time-
dependency of the angle α  is not limited. 
As the currents (and the voltages and flux linkages) of an arbitrary m -phase 
system can be described in two (perpendicular) coordinates, the space vector theo-
ry is applicable to arbitrary phase numbers. The phase numbers of stator and rotor 
may be even different (an example for this is the squirrel-cage induction machine). 
By applying the space vector defined in Sect. 11.3 in total the following trans-
formation is achieved: 
• from the m-phase system in stationary coordinates  
• into a two-phase system in (arbitrarily) rotating coordinates.

11.6 Coupled Systems 
Regarding three-phase systems of stator (index “1“ and “I“) and rotor (index “2“ 
and “II“), respectively, the spatial position of the rotor system against the stator 
system has to be considered by the time-dependent angle ( )t
γ
. It is assumed here 
that the rotor values are already transformed to the stator system (a special nota-
tion for this is omitted to simplify the description). 
The coupling of both systems is realized via the flux linkages. As it is obvious 
from Fig. 11.4 (example for 
0
α =
), the coupling via the flux linkages is depend-
ent on the rotor position because of the time-dependent angle ( )t
γ
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 11.4. Coupling between stator and rotor system. 
Introducing an additional rotation with 
je γ  for the space vectors of the rotor 
(Fig. 11.5), both systems are transformed to a commonly rotating coordinate sys-
tem.

15 It has to be considered that the angle γ  describes the relative movement between stator and 
rotor in electrical degrees (relative movement of the magnetic fluxes). The relation between the 
mechanical angular frequency and the rotor speed is obtained by means of the number of pole 
pairs p :

 may have arbitrary time-dependencies. This is crucial for the calcula-
tion of dynamic or transient operation conditions. In the following the explicit de-
scription of the time-dependency of the angular frequencies (analogously to the 
angles α  and γ ) will be omitted to simplify the writing.

17 Like usually done the rotor parameters of the machine are transformed to the stator system (the 
representation with primed variables is omitted here to achieve a more simple writing). This 
transformation is described e.g. in Sect. 4.1 for the induction machine. 
18 The transformation of the rotor values to the stator system will be done analogously to Sect. 
4.1; this transformation is assumed here (please see the beginning of Sect. 11.6). The difference 
to the deduction in Sect. 4.1. is that here not the stationary operation condition is calculated by 
means of the single-phase complex phasors, but all time-dependencies in all phases of stator and 
rotor are considered explicitly.

11.8.3 Summary of Results 
The transformation of the machine parameters from the existing (three-phase) ma-
chine to the space vector notation is done like explained in Table 11.1. Conse-
quently, the components of the machine in space vector notation are identical to 
the components, which are already deduced for the stationary operation of the ma-
chine. Therefore, the transformation is resistance- and inductivity-invariant.

11.10 Special Coordinate Systems 
For rotating field machines it is often necessary to perform the calculations in dif-
ferent coordinate systems. Examples are: 
• Realizing constant mutual inductivities for salient-pole synchronous machines 
→ here the calculation in coordinate system fixed to the rotor is advantageous; 
• Field-oriented control of induction machines 
 
→ here the usage of a field-oriented coordinate system is advantageous. 
Because of this reason the general transformation to a coordinate system rotat-
ing with arbitrary angular frequency 
CS
d
dt
α
ω
=
 is very beneficial. The set of 

322      11 Space Vector Theory 
equations is generally applicable and depending on the machine topology or use-
fulness the angle ( )t
α
 can be chosen arbitrarily, e.g.: 
• 
( )t
0
α
=
 
 
stationary coordinate system (fixed to the stator), in  
  
 
 
literature the axes “ x “ and “ y “ of the coordinate  
  
 
 
system are often called in this case “ α “ and “β “; 
• 
CS
mech

=

coordinate system rotating with the rotor speed (fixed to  
  
 
 
the rotor), in literature the axes “ x “ and “ y “ of the  
  
 
 
coordinate system are then often called “ q “ and “ d “; 
• 
CS
1
ω
= ω  
 
coordinate system rotating with the synchronous speed; 
• 
CS
μ
ω
= ω  
 
coordinate system rotating with the air-gap flux, even  
  
 
 
for this coordinate system in literature the axes “ x “ 
  
 
 
and “ y “are often called “q-axis “ and “d-axis “. 
11.11 Relation between Space Vector Theory and Two-Axis-
Theory 
In addition to the space vector theory described in the preceding sections even the 
two-axis-theory is known to calculate dynamic operating conditions in electrical 
machines. 
Both theories are strongly linked to each other, especially both theories require 
the same assumptions that have to be fulfilled for their application (please refer to 
Sect. 11.2). 
The main difference can be found in the definition of the vectors. In the two-
axis-theory the vectors are defined as follows (here exemplarily shown for the cur-
rents):

11.12 Relation between Space Vectors and Phasors      323 
Apart from the factor 3 2  this equation is identical to the torque equation in 
space vector notation. 
Therefore, the space vector notation has the advantage that voltages and cur-
rents can be interpreted quite clearly: Having a stationary, symmetric operation the 
amplitudes of current, voltage, and flux linkage space vectors are identical to the 
amplitudes of the phase values. But this transformation is not power-invariant, 
which can be deduced from the factor 3 2  in the torque equation. 
In contrary, it can be shown that the two-axis-theory is power-invariant. How-
ever, the interpretation of the voltages and currents are not so clear (i.e. for calcu-
lation of the really flowing currents a respective factor has to be introduced). 
11.12 Relation between Space Vectors and Phasors 
Between the space vectors (e.g. Sect. 11.3) and the phasors (e.g. Sect. 1.6) there is 
a formal similarity. Regarding the current phasor of the positive system when hav-
ing symmetric components (see Sect. 1.6), the following is true:

(11.74) 
Here 
 p
I
 is the current phasor of the positive system and 
 u
I
, 
 v
I
 and 
 w
I
 are 
the current phasors of the three phase currents. 
A main requirement for the application of the symmetric components was that 
the three phase currents are sinusoidal with the same frequency (then it can be cal-
culated with rms-values, which is indicated by the capital letters in the above 
equation). With other words: Steady-state (but asymmetric) operation conditions 
can be calculated smartly by means of complex phasors. 
The space vectors were defined in the preceding Sect. 11.3. For the currents 
and the special case

324      11 Space Vector Theory 
When introducing the space vectors it was explicitly emphasized that there are 
no restrictions for the time-dependency of the currents.20 This is the main differ-
ence with regards to content to the phasors, and only because of this difference 
dynamic operation conditions are able to be calculated by space vectors, but not 
by phasors.

20 Reminder: When introducing the space vectors it was required that magneto-motive force, cur-
rent loading, and air-gap flux density are spatially sinusoidal for every point in time and that 
there is the same wavelength for all phases. This is realized by a clever winding distribution in 
the machine and a limitation to the fundamental waves (which, looked at precisely, is an approx-
imation).

For the calculation of the dynamic operation of the induction machine the general

ting effect any choice of ( )t

 is possible.

The real component of the stator voltage space vector is identical to the peak 
value of the phase voltage, the imaginary component is zero. As the coordinate 
system rotates in synchronism with the stator frequency (
CS

ω
= ω  had been cho-
sen), this is valid for any point in time. With other words: In stationary operation 
and having this choice of 
CS
ω
 all stator quantities become DC values (for the sta-
tor voltages this is shown in the last equation: right of the equal sign there is no 
time-dependency any more). 
Further evaluating the stator voltage equation gives:

This expression is totally imaginary; it is the no-load current of the induction 
machine in stationary operation. This no-load current has a phase shift of 90° 
against the stator voltage, which is already known from Chap. 4.

because the multiplication of a complex number with its conjugate-complex value

12.2 Fast Acceleration and Sudden Load Change 
In the following the fast acceleration of the induction machine will be calculated, 
if at the time t

namic characteristic. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 12.5. Torque-speed-characteristics of the induction machine: steady-state (blue) and dynam-
ic (red). 
Switching the induction machine at zero speed to the mains at first there are 
high oscillating torque components (because of the DC current components) ac-
companied by high short-circuit AC currents. After decaying of these oscillating 
torque components the machine accelerates depending on the size of the coupled 
masses and it swings into the no-load operation (again with some oscillations). 
The sudden load change initially decelerates the machine, until the electromag-
netic torque is generated. Then an additional transient operation into the next 
steady-state operation point occurs. The steady-state speed is a little less than the 
synchronous speed. 
The deviations from the steady-state characteristic are remarkable, see the 
comparison in Fig. 12.5. After decaying of all transient effects all operation points 
calculated by means of the equations for the dynamic operation are lying on the 
steady-state characteristic. 
Figure 12.6 shows the stator current space vector for these transient operations 
in the complex plane (red characteristic). In addition, the blue characteristic illus-
trates the steady-state current circle diagram of the induction machine (circle dia-
gram of the current amplitude, not the circle diagram of the current rms-value). 
Even from these characteristics features of transient operations become obvi-
ous. High oscillating currents with large deviation from the steady-state character-
istic do occur. For fast acceleration as well as for sudden load change the final

practically is quasi steady-state (acceleration on the steady-state characteristic). 
In both cases (dynamic acceleration with oscillations or quasi steady-state ac-
celeration) the induction machine is not suitable being used as a dynamic control 
unit in a drive system. However, in the following a solution will be developed how 
to employ the induction machine as such a dynamic control unit (similar to the 
DC-machine).

The armature quadrature-axis field is assumed being completely compensated 
by the commutation poles and the compensation windings (in Fig. 12.7 this is not 
shown for the sake of clarity); because of this the exciting flux is not influenced 
by the armature current (the armature flux linkage in the quadrature-axis is zero: 
A,q
0
Ψ
=
). This means that the armature flux linkage in the direct-axis just de-
pends on the field excitation current (
A,d

); the torque is then produced by:

the angular frequency of the rotor flux:

tors are decomposed into their components and these components are allocated to 
the respective axes. Firstly, the common set of equations follows from Eqs.

As the coordinate system rotates with the angular frequency of the rotor flux 
(please refer to the choice of ( )t
α
 in Eq. (12.1)), the above given description in 
components is representing the stator and rotor MMF decomposition in direct axis 
(d-axis, y -component) and quadrature axis (q-axis, x -component) with respect to 
the rotor flux. As this is a flux-oriented coordinate system, the y - and x -
components are named in the following d-component (direct component) and q-
component (quadrature component).21 
This decomposition into d- and q-components leads to a clear decoupling and 
by clever control enables the impression of suitable phase currents that the follow-
ing aims are achievable: 
• the rotor flux linkage in the quadrature axis is zero (
II,q
0
ψ
=
) 
• the rotor flux linkage in the direct axis only depends on the magnetizing current 
(
II,d

) 
                                                           
21 The identification with “d“ and “q“ is just a different naming of the components, that usually 
is introduced for flux-oriented coordinate systems. 

338      12 Dynamic Operation and Control of Induction Machines 
• the torque is then only generated by the perpendicular components of rotor flux 
and stator current: 
II,d I,q
T
i
ψ

. 
The described operation is called “field-oriented”. An observer, stationary to 
the system rotating with ( )t
α
, sees the same field distribution and torque genera-
tion like for the DC-machine. Simple relations for the control variables rotor flux 
and active stator current are obtained, that can be adjusted independently from 
each other like for the DC-machine. 
In the following it will be described, how to reach the above mentioned aims 
(for the sake of clarity the explicit description of the time dependencies is avoided 
in the following equations). For the rotor flux linkages it is required in direct axis 
and in quadrature axis, respectively:

shows that the direct component of the stator current ( I,d

tude of the rotor flux (that is proportional to 
,d

winding of the DC-machine a large time constant (the rotor time constant

relevant. Therefore, the magnitude of the rotor flux is not suitable for realizing fast 
control actions.

and the magnitude of the rotor flux (

are completing the machine model concerning the interaction of stator voltages 
and stator currents. Regarding the stator current components the induction ma-
chine acts like a first-order delay element (PT1 element) with the time constant 
1
στ  and the gain

hand terms in the above equations. The expressions

These equations and the deduced block diagram (see Fig. 12.8) describe the in-
duction machine equivalently to the equations in Sects. 12.1 and 12.2. Switching 
the mains voltage suddenly to the machine at zero speed the same acceleration 
characteristics (and the same transient characteristics when suddenly loading the 
machine) like in Sect. 12.2 are obtained! 
The advantage of the field-oriented description for the dynamic operation of the 
induction machine will become clear in the following Sect. 12.4. 
12.4 Field-Oriented Control of Induction Machines with 
Impressed Stator Currents 
The advantage of the description shown in the last section is that now the same 
control strategy like for the separately excited DC-machine can be applied to the 
induction machine, by which the induction machine is qualified to be applied as a 
highly dynamic drive: The magnetizing current and consequently the rotor flux 
shall be hold constantly at their nominal values, the torque shall be adjusted only 
by means of the quadrature component of the stator current.22 To reach this the 
transformed stator currents must be independently controllable in direct and quad-
rature axis. This kind of control (field-oriented control, FOC) has been developed 
end of the 1960s, begin of the 1970s by Karl Hasse and Felix Blaschke inde-
pendently from each other. 
The above described controllability is enabled by  
                                                           
22 Here it is to be regarded that the stator flux increases with the load, therefore saturation may 
occur in the stator. 

12.4 Field-Oriented Control of Induction Machines with Impressed Stator Currents      345 
• power electronic devices with high switching frequency (for small power about 
20kHz ) and 
• short sampling intervals for the control (for small power some 100 s
μ  for the 
current control, for the speed control some ms ). 
If these conditions are valid, it can be assumed that the stator currents are im-
pressed. Then the equations of the relations between stator voltages and stator cur-
rents can be omitted because these are handled intrinsically in the power electronic 
converter. The respective block diagram is shown in Fig. 12.10. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 12.10. Block diagram of the induction machine in field-oriented coordinates with impressed 
stator currents. 
The block diagram of the induction machine in field-oriented coordinates with 
impressed stator currents corresponds to the block diagram of the separately excit-
ed DC-machine with neglected armature time constant (please refer to Sect. 10.1). 
This means that the torque production at constant rotor flux follows the quadrature 
component of the stator current 
I,q
i
 without any delay and the rotor flux is con-
trollable only by the direct component of the stator current. 
Consequently, the aim of a highly dynamic drive system is reached in principle. 
But if the induction machine shall be controlled in field-oriented coordinates, it is 
necessary to know the instantaneous amplitude and phase of the rotor flux. Having 
a squirrel-cage rotor the rotor currents and voltages cannot be measured and the 
measurement of the air-gap flux, which is just an approximation, is very costly 
and susceptible to faults.

However, amplitude and phase of the rotor flux can be calculated from meas-
ured values of the stator currents and the speed, by evaluating the rotor voltage

Fig. 12.11. Block diagram of the flux model. 
It is obvious that the rotor time constant 
2
τ  is decisive for the quality of the 
flux model. Particularly, there is the challenge to precisely know the rotor re-
sistance 
2
R  depending on the actual temperature during operation. 
Once the rotor time constant 
2
τ  is known, the induction machine can be con-
trolled highly dynamic. For a drive system with speed controller, torque controller, 
and flux controller the block diagram in Fig. 12.12 is obtained.

στ the double 
torque (against the steady-state operation at symmetric, fixed mains) is obtained. 
Having the same machine data as for the example in Sect. 12.2 (fast accelera-
tion and sudden load change at fixed mains), the time-dependent characteristics 
shown in Fig. 12.14 are obtained (just the acceleration is shown; therefore the time 
is limited to an interval from 0s to 0.12s). 
The flux generating current 
,d
iμ
 (shown in red in Fig. 12.14) is increased quite 
slowly in this example because of the relatively large time constant 
2
τ . However, 
the torque generating current 
I,q
i
 (shown in blue in Fig. 12.14) is switched from 
its nominal value to zero after about 0.097s, because the run-up period is already 
finished. 
Figures 12.15 and 12.16 show the torque and the speed during this acceleration 
period (the scale of the vertical axes are the same like in Sect. 12.2). The torque is 
increased analogously to the magnetizing current 
,d
iμ
 as long as 
I,q

 is true. 
The acceleration time is considerably shorter (compared to the operation at fixed 
mains) and there are no oscillations.

and a very steep speed increase (the magnetizing current is increased quite

simulation time). 
• After finishing the acceleration and until switching on the load at the time 0.6s 
the quadrature current is set to I,q

, then the speed is constant. 
• After switching on the load the influence of the control can be recognized 
clearly: small speed changes provoked by the control of the torque producing 
quadrature current component I,q

 are noticeable. 
For a better comparison the speed-time-characteristics for acceleration at fixed 
mains (red line) and for acceleration with field-oriented control (blue line) are pre-
sented once again in Fig. 12.18. The entire acceleration period is shown from 0s to 
0.6s. The improvement of the dynamic behavior against the operation at fixed 
mains (please refer to Sect. 12.2) is impressive. The additional effort to realize this 
operational behavior mainly is a powerful controller and the power electronic 
converter.

12.4 Field-Oriented Control of Induction Machines with Impressed Stator Currents      355 
In contrast to the acceleration at fixed mains (see Fig. 12.2) the amplitudes of 
the three phase currents are identical and (during acceleration and during steady-
state operation) constant in time. In addition, the maximum phase current is lower 
than for the uncontrolled acceleration. 
The change of frequency of the phase currents is characteristic for the influence 
of the power electronic converter, this would not be possible at fixed mains (con-
stant voltage concerning amplitude and frequency). 
When finishing the acceleration period (at about 0.097s) the current component 
I,q
i
 is set to zero. This is noticeable in the characteristics of the phase currents by 
the simultaneous change of amplitude and phase; then the frequency is not 
changed any longer. During the entire operation the slip is maintained at the pull-
out slip of the steady-state operation (
R
2
1
ω
=
στ ); the torque is adjusted by the 
current (more precisely: the current component I,q
i
). 
Figure 12.20 shows the stator current space vector at field-oriented control (in 
red) and the circle diagram of the current amplitude in steady-state operation (blue 
curve). Even with this graph the differences to the dynamic operation at fixed 
mains supply (please refer to Fig. 12.6) become obvious.

12.5 Field-Oriented Control of Induction Machines with 
Impressed Stator Voltages 
Up to now the field-oriented control (FOC) of induction machines has been re-
garded assuming that current injecting electronic power converters with high 
switching frequency and sufficient voltage reserve are available as well as fast mi-
crocontrollers for calculating the control algorithms. Regarding electrical drives 
with a power of up to some kW this is given (servo drives with transistorized in-
verters and switching frequencies up to about 20 kHz). For larger drives often 
pulse-width modulated inverters with intermediate DC-voltage and switching fre-
quencies of a few kHz are used. Then the above mentioned conditions are no 
longer fulfilled. This means that the stator voltage equations have to be regarded 
in addition (

Both control paths are coupled via the stator currents, therefore they are not in-
dependent from each other. However, a decoupling is required so that the current 
controllers can be adjusted independently. This can be achieved if negative com-
pensation voltages are added to the output voltages of the controllers (
C,d
u
 and 
C,q
u
) in such a way that the coupling voltages are zero. Now the controllers see 
decoupled paths. For the compensation usually it is assumed that the rotor flux 
linkage is constant, i.e.

means of the decoupling network. The instantaneous values of rotor flux ampli-
tude and phase, which are required for the control, are calculated by means of the

coordinate transformation (the angle α  is calculated by means of the mechanical 
speed). 
However, mechanical speed sensors have some disadvantages that preferably 
should be avoided: 
• vulnerability against outside impacts (forces, torques, temperatures, dirt) 
• costs 
• space consumption 
• necessity of a free shaft extension  
Therefore it is desirable to compute the speed from the measured terminal val-
ues of the machine (often this method is denominated as “sensorless” speed con-
trol). The method can be explained by means of the block diagram of the induc-
tion machine shown in Fig. 12.23.

and the rotor flux linkage is:

(12.75) 
Consequently the amplitude and phase of the rotor flux linkage are known: 
• The phase is the angle α , which is necessary for the coordinate transformation. 
By differentiating the angular frequency 
μ
ω  is obtained; together with the val-
ue for 
R
ω  this is used for the speed control. 
• The amplitude of the rotor flux linkage is already known from Sect. 12.4 (flux 
model) and is therefore not necessary at this moment.

• The above equations for calculating the phase of the rotor flux linkage are 
evaluated for a two-phase system, after measuring the three-phase values 
(phase currents and voltages) and subsequent coordinate transformation. 
• The evaluation of the integral is difficult for small voltages or small frequen-
cies (preciseness and size of the time interval); i.e. for very small speed this 
method is quite incorrect. The method is reliable from about 5% of the nominal 
speed onwards. 
The flux model from Sect. 12.4 (that solely is based on current measurement) 
showed the disadvantage of temperature dependency (dependency of the rotor 
time constant 
2τ ); the model presented in this section possesses the disadvantage 
of inaccuracy at small speed. By clever combination the area of reliable operation 
without mechanical speed sensor can be considerably increased. 
12.7 Direct Torque Control 
The direct torque control (DTC) has been developed independently, nearly simul-
taneously and in similar form at the beginning of the 1980s in Germany (Manfred 
Depenbrock) and in Japan (Isao Takahashi and Toshihiko Noguchi) for induction 
machines. In the meantime this method also is applied to different rotating field 
machines. The principle of DTC is that by choosing the phase voltages the flux 
and the torque are directly influenced. 
To explain this, a simple switch-model for the power electronic converter and a 
machine with Y-connected phases is regarded. The diagram is shown in Fig. 
12.24.

(like it is shown in Fig. 12.26).

Consequently there is always one phase with a voltage drop of 2/3 of the inter-
mediate voltage

1/3 of the intermediate voltage. Then the voltage space vector

12.7 Direct Torque Control      363 
If the stator resistance 
I
R  can be neglected, the stator voltage space vectors 
1
uG  
to 
6
uG  are causing a continuous motion of the stator flux space vector, whereas the 
stator voltage space vectors 
0
uG  and 
7
uG  are stopping the stator flux space vector. 
If the stator voltage space vectors 
1
uG  to 
6
uG  are switched just once per period 
(which is called “block-mode operation”), the stator flux space vector moves on a 
hexagon. Consequently the first task (adjusting the flux of the machine) is fulfilled 
(see Fig. 12.27).

Consequently, the torque generation is determined by the amplitudes of the sta-
tor flux linkage, the rotor flux linkage, and the relative phase shift of both. 
In the following it is assumed that the speed and the amplitude of the rotor flux 
linkage is constant during one switching condition of the stator voltage space vec-
tor. Then the stator flux linkage and the torque are adjusted directly by the choice 
of the stator voltage space vector. For this choice of the stator voltage space vector 
– required in the actual operating condition of the machine – the following steps 
have to be performed: 
• division of the α -β -plane into sectors; 
• calculation, in which sector the actual stator flux linkage is located; 
• evaluation, if the stator flux linkage and the torque have to be increased or de-
creased; 
• adjusting the resulting stator voltage space vector. 

12.7 Direct Torque Control      365 
The sectors in the α -β -plane can be chosen e.g. like it is shown in Fig. 12.28. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 12.28. Definition of the sectors in the α-β-plane. 
By means of a machine model the instantaneous location and amplitude of the 
stator flux linkage and the value of the torque can be calculated at any time. By 
comparison with the respective set values differences are obtained that are fed to a 
hysteresis controller each. From the instantaneous location of the stator flux link-
age and the necessity to increase or decrease the stator flux linkage and the torque 
(outputs of the hysteresis controllers “1” or “-1”), the next stator voltage space 
vector is obtained by means of a table. Respective switching signals

 activate the power electronic switches of the converter. The corresponding 
block diagram is given in Fig. 12.29.

Fig. 12.29. Block diagram of the inverter-fed induction machine with direct torque control. 
The main advantages of the direct torque control against the field-oriented con-
trol are: 
• The calculation load in the microcontroller is much lower, because no coordi-
nate transformation is required. 
• Flux and torque are adjusted by means of simple hysteresis controllers; there is 
no need for current controllers or for pulse width modulation. Consequently the 
switching frequency of the power electronic switches is quite low. 
• There is only low sensitivity against varying rotor parameters, because only 
flux and torque calculation is needed. 
• For torque and flux control no knowledge of the speed is required; having the 
field-oriented control this was necessary to calculate the angle α . 
• Depending on the preciseness of the machine model even for the speed control 
the speed sensor can be omitted. 
• Generally, the torque control using DTC is faster than using the field-oriented 
control.

However, disadvantages of the DTC are: 
• Because of the missing current controllers there is no possibility of active form-
ing of the current waveform. This results in considerable deviations from the 
ideal sinusoidal function and therefore leads to increased losses of the induction 
machine. 
• Having non-sinusoidal currents the preciseness of the flux and torque calcula-
tion strongly depends on the sampling interval and preciseness of the current 
measurement as well as on the cycle period of the controller. 
• The torque ripple depends on the current waveform and the chosen widths of 
the hysteresis controllers; usually this torque ripple is larger than for the field-
oriented control. This results in mechanical load and acoustic noise. 
• The switching frequency of the power electronic devices is not fixed and it 
changes with the speed of the machine. Consequently, even the switching loss-
es of the power electronic devices are speed-dependent. 
Generally the DTC is characterized by simplicity, robustness, low switching 
losses, and fast torque control. These features are especially interesting for varia-
ble-speed drives with high power. 
 
The DTC described until now can be extended, e.g. by  
• consideration of the measured intermediate voltage when calculating the stator 
voltage space vector; 
• high-frequent switching (e.g. PWM) and utilization of all voltage vectors 
0
uG  to 
7
uG  (by this and with increasing frequency the motion of the flux space vector 
can be approximated more and more to a circle); 
• increasing the number of sectors; 
• hysteresis controller with three steps (additional step “0“, i.e. no change of flux 
or torque). 
By these means the technical features (e.g. current waveform and torque ripple) 
are improved, but the effort is increased.

13 Dynamic Operation of Synchronous 
Machines 
13.1 Oscillations of Synchronous Machines, Damper Winding 
In this section the behavior of the synchronous machine will be regarded, if the ro-
tor angle ϑ  is changed by small values Δϑ  from the operation point (index “0”). 
As only small changes are considered, the description of the synchronous machine 
in steady-state operation (Chap. 5) will be used. There is: 
 
0
ϑ = ϑ + Δϑ  
(13.1) 
In steady-state operation the external driving torque of the turbine is equal to 
the torque of the synchronous machine in every operating point:

23 In the following it will be assumed that the stator current angular frequency 
1
ω  always is 
adapted to the speed of the machine. Otherwise the frequency condition for generating a constant 
torque (see Chap. 3 “Rotating Field Theory”) would not be fulfilled and a pure oscillating torque 
would occur. The influence of this frequency change on other data (e.g. the pull-out torque) is 
neglected because just small changes are regarded; in addition the friction is neglected.

Most often the frequency of this mechanical oscillation of the synchronous ma-

. 
During operation of the synchronous machine oscillations can be evoked by 
electrical or mechanical load changes, which are accompanied by current oscilla-
tions. Especially for drives with a non-constant torque (e.g. diesel engine or piston 
compressor) these oscillations may reach critically high values, if the excitation is 
near to the eigenfrequency. It is also possible that different generators may excite 
each other until they fall out of synchronism. 
For damping of these oscillations all synchronous machines are equipped with 
a damper winding. The effect of such a damper winding is comparable with the 
squirrel-cage of an induction machine. 
For high-speed generators with cylindrical rotor damper bars are inserted into 
the slots of the rotor in addition to the excitation winding; these damper bars are 
short-circuited at their axial ends (even electrically conductive slot wedges may be 
used as damper bars). Solid rotors have a damping effect as well, because eddy 
currents may develop. For salient-pole synchronous machines there are additional 
slots with bars in the poles; then again the bars are short-circuited at their axial 
ends. 
The calculation of the damper winding can be started from the equations of the 
induction machine (the torque is negative as it decelerates the machine):

inertia divided by the number of pole pairs corresponds to the mass.

(13.23) 
For maximizing the effect of the damper winding (and therefore damping the 
oscillations caused by load changes most quickly) the time constant 
D
τ  must be 
small or the damping D must be large. This means that the resistance 
2
R′  must be 
small. Consequently there is high copper mass and costs needed for the damper 
cage. 
Besides the damping of oscillations the damper winding has two additional 
tasks: 
• From asymmetric loading an opposite rotating field with harmonic oscillations 
in stator voltage and stator current is generated, which causes additional iron 
losses and copper losses. In the damper winding currents are evoked that (ac-
cording to Lenz’ Law) act against their cause. Therefore, these harmonic oscil-
lations and the additional losses are strongly reduced. 
• With sufficient heat capacity of the damper winding the synchronous machine 
may be started with the damper cage like an induction machine. Because of the 
large slip during run-up the rotating field of the stator would induce high volt-
ages in the not-connected excitation winding; therefore the excitation winding 
is short-circuited at first. Reaching the no-load speed the excitation voltage is 
switched on and the machine synchronizes suddenly. This is accompanied by 
current pulses and oscillating torque components, so that this kind of run-up 
can be applied only for small power machines.

13.2 Steady-State Operation of Non Salient-Pole Synchronous 
Machines in Space Vector Notation 
Starting with the equations in space vector notation (which are also valid for the 
dynamic operation of electrical machines) the steady-state operation of the sym-
metric synchronous machine with non salient-pole (cylindrical) rotor shall be cal-
culated in this section. 
The air-gap is assumed being constant; the rotor shall be symmetric, i.e. there 
are two identical windings shifted electrically by 90°. The excitation winding is 
supplied with DC current via slip rings, the damper winding is short-circuited.

As the space vector theory has been developed in the energy consumption sys-
tem, this is the set of equations for the synchronous machine in the energy con-
sumption system. Usually the synchronous machine is described in the energy 
generation system (because generally this machine type is used as a generator, see 

376      13 Dynamic Operation of Synchronous Machines 
Chap. 5), therefore in the following the synchronous machine shall be described in 
terms of the energy generation system. To reach this the voltages

13.3 Sudden Short-Circuit of Non Salient-Pole Synchronous Machines      381 
13.3 Sudden Short-Circuit of Non Salient-Pole Synchronous 
Machines 
13.3.1 Fundamentals 
As an example for the dynamic operation of the synchronous machine the sudden 
three-phase short-circuit of a non salient-pole synchronous generator at no-load 
and nominal excitation will be calculated (no-load means: open terminals and ro-
tor mechanically driven at synchronous speed). Sudden short-circuit is the transi-
ent process that is occurring directly after short-circuiting of the stator terminals 
(in contrast to the permanent short-circuit that is present when all transient pro-
cesses are subsided); i.e. it is the transient phase between steady-state no-load op-
eration to steady-state short-circuit operation. 
For the sake of simplification the following approximations are introduced: 
• The speed of the rotor shall remain constant at synchronous speed during the 
transient operation (the generator further shall be driven mechanically with 
synchronous speed). 
• The non salient-pole machine shall be symmetric with two identical rotor wind-
ings shifted electrically by 90°. The excitation winding is supplied with DC 
current via two slip rings; the damper winding, lying in the quadrature axis, is 
short-circuited. 
• A rotating coordinate system with 
CS
1
mech
d
dt
d

α
= ω
= ω = ω
= γ
 (like in 
Sect. 13.2) is chosen. The stator is composed of systems I,d  and I,q , the ro-
tor shows the systems II,d  (excitation winding) and II,q  (damper winding). 
• The initial condition is defined by the switching moment: 
( )
1
t
t
α
= ω
+ ε . 
Here ε  is an (at this time) arbitrary phase angle. 
13.3.2 Initial Conditions for t = 0 
The original state before the sudden short-circuit is the no-load operation at nomi-
nal excitation. In this steady-state operation the Ohmic resistances of the stator 
winding generally can be neglected: 
1
R
0
=
 (this assumption will be abolished 
later). 
In the following the values just before the moment of switching get the addi-
tional index “0”. For the initial conditions it follows: 

382      13 Dynamic Operation of Synchronous Machines 
• The stator currents are zero, because the terminals are not connected; the 
damper current is zero, because there is a steady-state operation at synchronous 
speed.

culate them separately.

• For 
0
ε =
 and time t
0
=
 the flux linkage in phase u is zero, i.e. the peak value 
of the voltage is induced. 
• For 
2
ε = π
 and time t
0
=
 the flux linkage in phase u is maximum, i.e. the 
induced voltage is zero.

Now the above introduced approximation of neglecting the Ohmic resistances of 
the stator winding is abolished (

R

≠
), because these resistances are responsible 
for the subsiding of the stator currents (damping characteristic). 
The stator voltage equations are now in matrix notation (because of the short-
circuit of the terminals this is identical for the energy consumption system and the 
energy generation system):

requirements the excitation current is located in the II,d -axis and the damper cur-
rent in the II,q -axis; therefore the rotor currents transformed to the stator winding 
are:

Using some approximation (which generally are fulfilled) the set of equations 
can be solved even analytically. The main advantage is that even qualitative pre-
dictions are possible and the influence of the different parameters can be investi-
gated on principle. In the following, this analytical solution is not shown in detail, 
just the results are given. 
The envelopes of the different time-dependent characteristics are:

13.3.4 Maximum Voltage Switching 
As it can be deduced from the above equations for the enveloping characteristics, 
the moment of switching (for maximum voltage switching there is 
0
ε =
) has no 
influence onto the maximum values of torque, excitation current, and damper cur-
rent. However, there is an influence onto the phase current. In the following Figs. 
13.2 to 13.6 all currents are given in kA, the torque is given in kNm and the time 
in s. 
Figure 13.2 shows the characteristic of the stator current in phase u (red) to-
gether with its medium value (magenta), the envelopes of the sudden short-circuit 
current (black dotted) and the envelopes of the permanent short-circuit current 
(blue dotted). The maximum value of the permanent short-circuit current is

quently the sudden short-circuit current is several times larger than the nominal 
current. The mean value of the current for maximum voltage switching is zero.

(13.91) 
and for the regarded generator amounts to 707.7kNm (at a nominal torque of 
127kNm; i.e. about a factor of 5.6 higher than the nominal torque). When con-
structing synchronous machines this high mechanical load has to be considered. 
The permanent short-circuit stator currents generate losses in the stator re-
sistances. These losses have to be covered by the driving torque (the power loss 
has to be equalized by the input power). As the speed has been assumed being 
constant, the acceleration torque is zero. Therefore, the torque balance gives

This low torque cannot be recognized in the above Fig. 13.3. But evaluating the 
same simulation like before with a different scale of the vertical axis results in Fig. 
13.4, which supports the above calculation. 
The currents I,d

 are independent from the moment of switch-
ing ε . Therefore, even the time-dependent characteristics of the torque (Figs. 13.3 
and 13.4) and the time-dependent characteristics of the rotor currents (excitation 
current in Fig. 13.5 and damper current in Fig. 13.6) are independent from the 
moment of switching. The excitation current as well as the damper current reach 
multiples of their nominal values during sudden short-circuit (similar to the phase 
current).

the moment of switching ε . Switching at a time instant where the voltage is zero 
(

13.3.6 Sudden Short-Circuit with Changing Speed and Rough 
Synchronization 
So far the sudden short-circuit of the non salient-pole machine has been calculated 
assuming that the speed is constant. This assumption shall be retracted now. For 
the following calculation it is assumed that: 
• At the time t
0s
=
 the machine operates with synchronous speed. 
• At the time t
0s
=
 the machine will be short-circuited, zero voltage switching 
for phase u (
2
ε = π
) is assumed (please refer to the preceding section). 
• The external driving torque 
ext
T
 shall be zero for the entire regarded time peri-
od.

• The speed decreases after switching on the short-circuit, because the short-
circuit currents generate losses in the Ohmic resistances. 
• The slope of the speed decrease depends on the inertia; this is assumed being

2.5 10 kgm
Θ =

• At the time t
0.2s
=
 the machine is switched to the mains again (still with 
ext

). As generally not all synchronizing conditions (please refer to Sect. 
5.3) are fulfilled, a rough synchronization happens. 
The stator terminal voltages in d-q-representation after the rough synchroniza-
tion are time-dependent, because there is a time-dependent instantaneous angle ς  
between the q -axis (rotating with 
mech

13.3 Sudden Short-Circuit of Non Salient-Pole Synchronous Machines      397 
Figures 13.9 to 13.13 on the one hand show the influence of the now time-
dependent speed, on the other hand the impact of the rough synchronization at the 
time t
0.2s
=
 is illustrated (like before the currents are represented in kA, the 
torque in kNm; the scale of the speed axis is in min-1). 
Figure 13.9 shows the time-dependent characteristic of the phase current. The 
small deviations compared to the respective figure in Sect. 13.3.5 (Fig. 13.7) in the 
first 0.2s , provoked by the slightly decreasing speed (time-dependent characteris-
tic of the speed see Fig. 13.13), are only noticeable by detailed analysis. The rough 
synchronization again evokes a transient operation with remarkable current oscil-
lations. As the machine is supplied by the mains voltage after this rough synchro-
nization, the final steady-state value of the phase current is no longer the perma-
nent short-circuit current, but it is equal to zero (because for these calculations the 
machine was assumed being unloaded). 
Even for the torque there is a transient in the time-dependent characteristic at 
time t
0.2s
=
 coming from the rough synchronization, see Fig. 13.10. It is obvi-
ous that the torque is negative directly after the short-circuit ( t
0s
=
), directly af-
ter the rough synchronization ( t
0.2s
=
) it is positive. Of course this depends on 
the relative position between the rotating stator field and the rotor at the time in-
stant of rough synchronization.

Fig. 13.12. Damper current (red) together with the envelopes of the sudden short-circuit damper 
current (black dotted). 
Even the excitation current (Fig. 13.11) shows the transient effect after rough 
synchronization, the final steady-state value is the respective nominal value. The 
maximum value of the excitation current after the rough synchronization has about 
the same value like after the short-circuit.  
The amplitude of the damper current after rough synchronization is even a fac-
tor of 1.5 larger than after the short-circuit; the final steady-state value is zero for 
each transient operation, see Fig. 13.12. 
Finally the speed-time-characteristic is shown in Fig. 13.13 (the synchronous 
speed for this machine is 1,500min-1). This speed-time-characteristic correlates 
with the torque-time-characteristic shown in Fig. 13.10: after the short-circuit the 
torque acts decelerating, after the rough synchronization it accelerates the rotor. 
During short-circuit ( 0s  to 0.2s ) the mean value of the speed in decreased, be-
cause the phase currents generate losses in the Ohmic resistances; this energy is 
taken from the reduction of rotational kinetic energy of the rotor (friction was ne-
glected). After the rough synchronization the machine is accelerated again and the 
speed oscillates transiently to the synchronous speed; this is done by means of the 
damper cage analogously to the operation of an induction machine. As in this sim-
ulation the entire load torque was assumed being zero (and therefore friction was 
neglected), the machine reaches the synchronous speed.

In reality the synchronous speed has to be adjusted by increasing the external 
driving torque (compensation of friction and other load torques) and stabilized by 
control (avoiding the overshoot).

The flux is pushed to a magnetically poor conducting leakage path, i.e. the sta-
tor winding has to deliver a MMF (i.e. a respective current must be conducted) 
that is able to drive the flux even along the leakage path. This demonstrates 
why the current has to be larger by a factor of 1 σ  compared to the permanent 
short-circuit (during permanent short-circuit the flux is conducted across stator

13.4 Steady-State Operation of Salient-Pole Synchronous 
Machines in Space Vector Notation 
In contrast to the synchronous machine with cylindrical rotor the salient-pole syn-
chronous machine is not constructed symmetrically, but the magnetic permeance 
is different in direct axis and quadrature axis (
d
q
X
X
>
). Therefore, the transfor-
mation may not be done arbitrarily, but it has to be oriented to the asymmetric part 
(rotor): only then constant mutual inductivities are obtained. 
Figure 13.16 is taken from Sect. 5.5. Here the replaced winding system of the 
salient-pole synchronous machine is designed in such a way that all windings are 
located in the d-axis (direct axis, axis of the excitation current) or perpendicular to 
this (q-axis, quadrature axis). Voltages and currents are shown here for the energy 
consumption system. 
Additionally it shall now be considered that a damper winding is present in the 
rotor having a direct component with the current 
D
i  and a quadrature component 
with the current Q
i . 
Analogously to Sect. 13.2 the following set of equations (here in the energy 
generation system) is obtained with

Setting up the equations for the flux linkages the correct consideration of the 
sign is important. In the direct axis the stator winding and the excitation winding 
are magnetizing in the same direction, if they conduct positive current. However 
the damper winding magnetizes in opposite direction. In the quadrature axis the 
stator winding and the damper winding are magnetizing in opposite direction. 
There is no magnetic coupling between the direct axis and the quadrature axis.

With the equations for the flux linkages, the stator voltage equations, and the 
torque equation the salient-pole synchronous machine is described completely in a 
coordinate system rotating in synchronism with the rotor. 
Starting from these equations in space vector notation (for the calculation of the 
dynamic behavior) firstly as a special case the steady-state operation of the salient-
pole synchronous machine is regarded. In steady-state operation there is no time-
dependent change of the flux linkages ( d

This phasor diagram can be developed from the machine data like follows: 
• Given are U , I , and ϕ , e.g. as measurement values. 
• The voltage U
U

 is chosen being real. 
• The current I  is drawn considering the phase angle ϕ .  
• Perpendicular to this phasor I  the phasor 
q
jX I  is drawn with its base at the 
top of the phasor U
U

• The direction of the internal voltage 
P
U  is defined by the origin of the coordi-
nate system and the tip of the phasor 
q
jX I . With this even the angle ϑ  and 
the direction of the q-axis are fixed.  
• Perpendicular to the q-axis the d-axis is located. Now the current I  can be di-
vided into the components 
 d

 and 
 q

.  
• At the tip of the phasor

This result is already known from Chap. 5: the first summand corresponds to 
the torque of the non salient-pole synchronous machine and it depends on the ex-
citation, the second summand is the so-called reaction torque (reluctance torque) 
and it is not dependent on the excitation (it is merely generated by the difference 
in the magnetic permeance in d- and q-axis). Because of this reluctance torque the 
pull-out torque is reached at a rotor angle less than 
2
π
, see Fig. 13.19 (and Fig.

In addition to the shift of the pull-out torque to smaller rotor angles it can be 
deduced that the salient-pole synchronous machine delivers a higher pull-out 
torque for the same excitation current, because of the additional reluctance torque 
component (assumed is

13.5 Sudden Short-Circuit of Salient-Pole Synchronous

With some approximations the sudden short-circuit of the salient-pole synchro-

effort, in the following only the numerical solution is regarded. 
Firstly the initial conditions have to be determined. The situation before the

means that the excitation winding is supplied by its nominal voltage and the rotor 
rotates with synchronous speed). The values before the switching moment are 
nominated in the following with the additional index “0”. The initial conditions 
then are: 
• The stator currents are zero, because the terminals are not connected; the 
damper current is zero, because there is a steady-state operation at synchronous 
speed.

• For

 the flux linkage in phase u is zero, i.e. the peak value

 the flux linkage in phase u is maximum, i.e. the

Performing a respective simulation for calculating the sudden short-circuit of 
the salient-pole synchronous machine (for this the machine data have to be 
known), time-dependent characteristics are obtained that are similar (but not iden-
tical) to those obtained for the sudden short-circuit of the synchronous machine 
with cylindrical rotor: 
• In the case of sudden short-circuit the stator current reaches a very high value, 
which subsides to the permanent short-circuit current. 
• The excitation current increases to a very high value as well; subsequently it 
decreases analogously to the stator current. 
• The transformed stator currents 
di  and qi  are DC currents in steady-state op-
eration; 
di  is the reactive component (magnetizing), 
qi  is the active compo-
nent (torque). 
• The damper currents (for the regarded salient-pole synchronous machine these 
are D
i  and Q
i ) are only relevant during a small time interval directly after the 
switching, otherwise they are zero.

13.6 Transient Operation of Salient-Pole Synchronous Machines      415 
Having a constant driving torque 
ext
T
 instead of a constant speed, the speed 
decreases after the short-circuit (analogously to the behavior of the non salient-
pole machine), because the short-circuit currents generate losses in the Ohmic re-
sistances. These losses are supplied by a reduction of the kinetic energy of the sys-
tem. 
The calculation of the salient-pole synchronous machine is more complex than 
the calculation of the synchronous machine with cylindrical rotor, because there is 
an additional differential equation for the damper winding. 
13.6 Transient Operation of Salient-Pole Synchronous Machines 
The dynamic operation can be calculated similar to the steady-state operation if 
some simplifying requirements are assumed. The integration of a nonlinear set of 
equations is avoided, but it has to be checked always, if the assumptions are valid 
for the regarded operation: 
• The speed of the salient-pole synchronous machine is assumed being constant. 
The larger the inertia of the rotating masses, the better this assumption is ful-
filled. 
• The effect of the damper winding is not considered: Either the transient process 
of the damper currents subsides very quickly (considerably faster than the tran-
sient process of the stator phase currents), or there does not exist a damper 
winding. 
• The transformatorily induced voltage components can be neglected compared 
to the rotatorily induced voltage components (e.g. 
d
q
d
 
dt
ψ
ωψ

). 
• The excitation flux linkage 
F
ψ  is constant during the entire transient period. 
This is valid, e.g. if the machine is equipped with a voltage controller that com-
pensates the Ohmic voltage drop at the resistance in the excitation circuit if the 
current changes: 
F

If these conditions are fulfilled it is called the “transient operation” of the syn-
chronous machine (compared to the “dynamic operation” regarded in the preced-
ing section). From the general set of equations for the salient-pole synchronous 
machine the following set of equations for this transient operation can be deduced:

Relating the torque to the pull-out torque of a respective non-salient-pole syn-
chronous machine, Fig. 13.22 is obtained (this figure can be compared directly to 
the figures shown in Sects. 13.4 and 13.5; 
P

U

=
 has been chosen). It be-
comes obvious that during transient operation a considerably higher pull-out 
torque is achieved than during steady-state operation. Moreover the pull-out 
torque is reached for a rotor angle 
2
ϑ > π
, whereas for the steady-state operation 
the pull-out torque is reached for 
2
ϑ < π
. This effect comes from the fact that 
during transient operation the excitation flux is kept constant by increasing the ex-
citation current (and therefore even the torque) to a considerably higher value. Af-
ter subsiding of the time-dependent characteristics the new steady-state operation 
is obtained.

• Electrical load change: A switching action in the supplying mains suddenly 
changes mains voltage and mains reactance. For calculating 
P
U′  the values of 
the steady-state operation just before the switching moment have to be taken. 
For the time period after the switching moment the new values of mains volt-
age and mains reactance have to be considered. Because of 
P
U′  being constant 
the currents 
dI  und 
qI  change nearly according to a step-function. Therefore 
the machine generates a different torque than before the switching moment. 
Because of the inertia the rotor moves with synchronous speed; consequently a 
torque difference occurs resulting in a movement ( )t
ϑ
 of the rotor angle. 
• Mechanical load change: When the driving torque is changed suddenly, mains 
voltage and mains reactance remain unchanged. Directly after this disturbance 
the same currents like before are flowing, consequently the torque generated by 
the synchronous machine is unchanged. Because of the change of the driving 
torque there is a torque difference resulting in a movement ( )t
ϑ
 of the rotor 
angle. Subsequently even the currents and the torque of the synchronous ma-
chine are changed.

14 Dynamic Operation and Control of 
Permanent Magnet Excited Rotating Field 
Machines 
14.1 Principle Operation 
As already described in Chap. 6, the principle operation of the permanent magnet 
excited rotating field machine is like follows: 
The synchronous machine contains permanent magnets to generate the excita-
tion field, but there is no starting cage present. The three-phase machine is sup-
plied by an inverter which realizes a three-phase current system. As a main differ-
ence to what is described in Chap. 6, here no limiting assumptions concerning the 
time-dependency of the currents is made (especially there is no need for sinusoidal 
currents). 
The fundamental frequency of the supplying three-phase system determines the 
frequency of the rotating magneto-motive force and therefore even the rotor speed. 
The rotating magneto-motive force together with the field of the permanent mag-
net rotor generates the torque. Mostly, this torque shall be as smooth as possible. 
The rotation of the rotating stator field is realized depending on the rotor position 
by means of the inverter in such a way, that the electrical angle between rotating 
magneto-motive force of the stator and the rotor field is 
2
π
 (i.e. ϑ = −ϕ ). With 
this the load angle in the energy consumption system already defined in Sect. 6.3 
becomes 
M
G
0
δ
= −δ
= −ϑ −ϕ =
. 
The rotor position can be measured by using sensors or it can be deduced from 
the terminal voltages and/or terminal currents. 
An operation is obtained that does no longer correspond to the synchronous 
machine, but to the DC-machine: 
• DC-machine: magneto-motive force of the armature and excitation field build 
an electrical angle of 
2
π
; this adjustment is performed mechanically by 
means of the commutator. 
• Synchronous machine: the rotor angle ϑ  and the phase angle ϕ  are adjusted 
depending on the operation point; there is no active influence on the phase shift 
between magneto-motive force of the stator and excitation field. 
• Electronically commutated permanent magnet excited rotating field machine: 
magneto-motive force of the stator and rotor field build an electrical angle of 
2
π
; this adjustment is performed electronically by means of the inverter.

426      14 Dynamic Operation and Control of Permanent Magnet Excited Rotating Field 
Machines 
14.2 Set of Equations for the Dynamic Operation 
In Fig. 14.1 a two-poles machine is shown; the ratio of pole arc per pole pitch is 
i
1
α <
. Moreover a magnetic asymmetry with 
d
q
L
L
≠
 is present. This is caused 
by the fact that the geometric air-gap along the circumference is constant whereas 
the magnetic effective air-gap is not constant (magnet materials have a relative 
permeability of about 
r,PM
1
μ
≈
; compared to this iron shows a very high relative 
permeability: 
r,Fe
1
μ
 ). The special case that the magnets are placed onto the 
surface of a cylindrical iron rotor is included in the following description, if

 is used. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 14.1. Sketch of a two-poles permanent magnet excited rotating field machine. 
Assuming that there is no damper winding also means that the rotor is manu-
factured from iron sheets (solid iron is electrically conductive and therefore would 
have a damping effect) and that rare-earth magnets (SmCo or NdFeB) have to be 
made of several isolated parts, because even these materials are electrically con-
ductive (this is not the case for the much cheaper ferrite magnets). 
For such a permanent magnet excited rotating field machine just a system of 
three windings has to be considered (as the coordinate system is oriented to the ro-
tor flux, the axes are nominated with “d“ and “q“): 
• I,d : stator direct axis (reactive current, flux generating) 
• I,q : stator quadrature axis (active current, torque generating) 
• II,d :  rotor direct axis (permanent magnets) 
• II,q :  rotor quadrature axis (no winding)

Analogously to Chap. 6 the energy consumption system is used here, because 
this machine topology mainly is used as a motor. 
By means of the space vector theory for rotating field machines the following 
set of equations is obtained (for the permanent magnets there does not exist a volt-
age equation; the constant rotor flux evoked from the permanent magnets is con-
sidered by the constant substitutive excitation current 
II,d,0

 in the equation of the 
stator flux linkage):25

25 This set of equations is very similar to that of the salient-pole synchronous machine (see Sect. 
13.5), but with two main differences: firstly, here the energy consumption system is used, and 
secondly for the permanent magnet excited machine 
d
q
L
L
<
 is true, whereas for the salient-
pole synchronous machine 
d
q
L
L

 is true. This comes from the fact that the magnetically ef-
fective air-gap (the iron-iron distance between stator and rotor) for the salient-pole synchronous 
machine is smaller in the d-axis than in the q-axis; for the permanent magnet excited machine 
however it is vice versa.

With this set of differential equations the permanent magnet excited rotating 
field machine is described completely. 
In the base speed region the machine is operated in such a way that stator MMF 
and rotor field (excitation field, 
md II,d,0
L
i
) are perpendicular to each other. Then 
the stator current component in the direct axis has to be zero ( I,d
i
0
=
); the stator 
current component in the quadrature axis I,q
i
 is the torque generating component. 
The voltages in the direct axis and in the quadrature axis can be deduced from the 
above equations. 
However, if a control method with

14.3 Steady-State Operation 
14.3.1 Fundamentals 
In the following the steady-state operation of permanent magnet excited rotating 
field machines will be calculated. As in principle they show the same motor con-
struction, permanent magnet synchronous machines (with sinusoidal currents) and 
brushless DC-motors (with step-by-step constant currents) will be regarded simul-
taneously. Because not always sinusoidal currents are used, the space vector theo-
ry has to be used even for the steady-state operation. In addition, the general case 
of machines with buried magnets will be considered by having different inductivi-
ties in d-axis and q-axis as 
d
q
L
L
<
 (surface mounted magnets are covered as a 
special case for 
d
q
L
L
L
=

). 
In steady-state operation the time derivatives of currents and speed are zero. 
Consequently the set of equations can be simplified to:

14.3.2 Base Speed Operation 
For the permanent magnet excited rotating field machine (BLDC-motor as well as 
PMSM) the positive q-direction is defined in the real axis and the positive d-

direction in the negative imaginary axis (please note that this d-q coordinate sys-
tem has the positive horizontal axis opposite to the positive horizontal axis of the 
complex plane). 
During base speed operation the angle between the magneto-motive force of 
the stator and the rotor field is 90° electrically. The rotor field is drawn in the di-
rect axis (negative imaginary axis), see also Sect. 14.2; the magneto-motive force 
of the stator merely is composed of the current

tive imaginary axis), it has a demagnetizing effect (therefore, this is called “field

 has to be decreased, so that the total current Ii  is 
not exceeding the nominal value (to avoid overheating). Therefore:

26 Please note that complex phasors were introduced as the non time-dependent components of 
the complex description of sinusoidally time-dependent variables (please refer to Sect. 1.6). In 
this chapter, explicitly non-sinusoidal time-dependencies of the variables are permissible. There-
fore, the respective illustration is called vector diagram and not phasor diagram. 

14.3 Steady-State Operation      435 
Because of this additional current in the negative d-axis I,d
i
 the angle between 
the magneto-motive force of the stator (
IiG ) and the rotor field (in the negative im-
aginary axis) is enlarged to more than 90° electrically. Consequently, the angle ϕ  
between voltage and current decreases, i.e. the power factor is changed into the di-
rection cos

Neglecting the Ohmic voltage drop in the voltage equations, the current in the 
negative d-axis I,d
i
 has the following consequences: 
• The current I,q

 decreases, because the total current is limited. 
• Consequently the absolute value of the voltage

site to each other, the voltage

stant, this can only be realized by increasing the speed. 
• From the torque equation 
I,q

 it is obvious that the torque decreas-
es: 
P

 describes the magnetization and this is constant; the lower current I,q
i
 
leads to a lower torque. 
Therefore, a typical field weakening operation is obtained (lower torque at 
higher speed; please compare e.g. with the field weakening operation of the induc-
tion machine). 
If the lowering of the torque shall be omitted, an additional torque component 
has to be generated to compensate for this effect. This is reached by an additional 
reluctance torque component by introducing a magnetic asymmetry.

Asymmetry 
During operation with leading load angle

• In addition to the torque generation current

 is applied; for the load angle

 holds true. 
• This current in the negative d-axis has a demagnetizing effect. 
• The torque generation current I,q

 has to be decreased, so that the total current 
Ii  is not exceeding the nominal value (to avoid overheating). 
The according vector diagram is shown in Fig. 14.5.

. Depending 
on the design of the electromagnetic circuit the torque may be even higher than in-
itially. This can be used in two different ways: 
• increase of the speed; 
• reduction of the current. 
By suitable electromagnetic design of the machine the current can be reduced 
and simultaneously the power factor cos ϕ  can be improved. This leads to lower 
losses in the machine and the supplying inverter (because of the lower current lev-
el) as well as to a lower apparent power of the inverter (because of the improved 
power factor).

As this has been deduced on the basis of the space vector theory, this result is

The permanent magnet excited torque is proportional to the bore volume

The reluctance torque as well is proportional to the bore volume (

The characteristics of these operation limits are: 
• The voltage limit changes to circles (instead of ellipses) shifted to the left from 
the origin, if surface mounted magnets (

• The voltage limit is speed dependent: with increasing speed the possible area of 
operation is narrowing increasingly. 
• The current limit is independent from machine topology and speed.

14.4 Limiting Characteristics and Torque Control      443 
From Fig. 14.7 it is obvious that torque control is much easier for machines 
with surface mounted magnets (
d
q
L
L
=
, here a linear relation exists between the 
current I,q
i
 and the torque) than for machines with buried magnets (
d
q
L
L
<
, for 
these machines I,d
i
 and I,q
i
 have to be controlled simultaneously, in addition the 
relation is non-linear). 
Now, the question shall be answered how to choose the current components 
I,d
i
 and 
I,q
i
 to reach the required torque with minimum total current (minimum 
losses, maximum efficiency).27 In literature, this is often referred to as “MTPA - 
maximum torque per ampere” control. However, more precisely it should be 
called “MTPC - maximum torque per current” control. For this, three cases are 
distinguished: 
 
1. Low speed, i.e. voltage limit is not relevant 
 
For a certain torque the total current is then minimal if the current vector and 
the vector 
( )
grad T  have the same direction. In Fig. 14.8 this is given on the 
dark blue curve. Therefore, this curve gives the optimum operating points of 
the machine.

27 Minimum total current leads to minimum losses and maximum efficiency, if the iron losses 
and permanent magnet losses are neglected. This approximation is valid for low speed (i.e. low 
frequency), at high speed iron and permanent magnet losses may even become dominant.

2. Medium speed (low field weakening); i.e. voltage limit is relevant  
Because of the voltage limitation the maximum torque is lower than in the 
case above; moreover, the optimum curve for reaching the required torque 
(dark blue curve) partly proceeds along the voltage limit curve, see Fig. 14.9.

3. High speed (strong field weakening); i.e. current limit is not relevant 
 
At strong field weakening only the voltage limit is relevant; the limit of the 
maximum total current is not longer reachable.  
The additional black characteristic in Fig. 14.10 features that limitation, for 
which the torque is decreasing again if the current is further increased and the 
voltage is hold on its limit. With other words: the black characteristic shows 
those operating points, where the required torque is reached with minimum 
flux (as can be deduced from the ellipse equation for the voltage limit, the el-
lipses are the operating points with constant flux). As this lower torque can be 
reached even with lower current, such an operation is not suitable. Therefore, 
this operating area is excluded.

Machines 
14.5 Control without Mechanical Sensor 
The mechanical speed has to be known for the speed controlled permanent magnet 
excited machine, see Sect. 14.2. However, as already mentioned in Sect. 12.6, me-
chanical speed sensors have some disadvantages that preferably should be avoid-
ed: 
• vulnerability against outside impacts (forces, torques, temperatures, dirt) 
• costs 
• space consumption 
• necessity of a free shaft extension  
Therefore, even for the permanent magnet excited machine it is desirable to 
calculate the speed from the measured terminal values of the machine (often this 
method is referred to as “sensorless” speed control). 
In the following just a short overview of different possibilities will be given for 
the sake of completeness, a detailed description of the alternatives would be far 
beyond the scope of this book. 
A first group of methods deals with direct electrical measurement (DC-voltage, 
DC-current, phase voltages, and / or phase currents) and a calculation of the re-
quired values by means of a nonadaptive machine model (similar to what is de-
scribed in Sect. 12.6 for the induction machine). 
These calculations can be improved by adaptive methods. Among these “Model 
Reference Adaptive Systems (MRAS)”, observer based estimators (e.g. Luen-
berger observer, sliding mode observer), and Kalman filters are the most im-
portant ones. 
A third group makes use of machine saliency and / or signal injection (with ro-
tating or alternating carrier). In many AC machines, the position dependence is a 
feature of the rotor. In the case of the interior PMSM there is a measurable spatial 
variation of inductances or resistances (saliencies) in the d- and q-axis due to ge-
ometrical and saturation effects, which can be used for the estimation of rotor po-
sition (e.g. used for the INFORM-method). Another method to estimate the rotor 
position is to add a high frequency stator voltage or current component and evalu-
ate the effects of the machine anisotropy on the amplitude of the corresponding 
stator voltage or current component. 
Finally there is a group of methods making use of artificial intelligence. Most 
prominent are neural networks, fuzzy logic based systems and fuzzy neural net-
works.

15 Concentrated Windings 
15.1 Conventional Concentrated Windings 
Electrical machines with non-overlapping concentrated windings have become an 
increasingly popular alternative to machines with distributed windings for certain 
applications. Concentrated winding machines (characterized by the fact that each 
coil is wound around a single tooth) have potentially more compact designs com-
pared to the conventional machine designs with distributed windings, due to short-
er and less complex end-windings. With such windings, the volume of copper 
used in the end-windings can be reduced in significant proportions, in particular if 
the axial length of the machine is small. Consequently, lower costs and lower 
losses can be expected. Even the process of manufacturing the coils is simplified, 
resulting in a very cost-effective solution. In addition such a winding design is bet-
ter qualified for safety critical applications, because phase-to-phase short-circuits 
become very unlikely. The photographs (Fig. 15.1) illustrate these differences ex-
emplarily. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 15.1. Photographs of different winding topologies (left: concentrated winding, right: distrib-
uted winding). 
There is a large variety of possibilities to realize an electrical machine with 
concentrated windings, e.g. 
• coils wound around every tooth (often referred to as “two-layer winding”) or 
coils wound around every other tooth (“single-layer winding”); 
• different number of teeth side by side with coils of the same phase; 
• torque producing rotating field wave (in the following called “working wave”) 
being the fundamental or a higher harmonic.

450      15 Concentrated Windings 
Some of these windings can be calculated according to Sect. 3.4, considering 
the concentrated winding as a special case of a distributed winding with an ex-
treme short-pitch factor. 
In the following, the concentrated winding will be analyzed analogously to 
Sect. 3.3 (supplying the machine with a symmetric current system and calculating 
the time-dependent MMF distribution). Afterwards, for this MMF distribution a 
Fourier analysis will be performed, which gives the harmonics of the MMF distri-
bution. 
Because of the large variety of possibilities, this will be done in the following 
by looking at the example of a double-layer three-phase machine with twelve sta-
tor slots, having two teeth side by side with coils of the same phase. This winding 
layout is shown in Fig. 15.2.

The harmonic analysis, which results in a time-independent characteristic for 
the given example, is presented in Fig. 15.4. A large number of MMF harmonics 
with high amplitude becomes obvious. The presence of these harmonics is the 
main disadvantage of concentrated windings, as they cause a variety of problems 
(mainly additional losses and acoustic noise).

number) of the winding shown in Fig. 15.2. 
For calculating the torque of an electrical machine, not the amplitude of the 
MMF working wave is essential, but the amplitude of the current loading working 
wave (please refer to Sect. 14.3.5). From Sect. 3.5 it can be deduced that the cur-
rent loading waves can be calculated from the spatial derivative of the MMF 
waves. Having a Fourier analysis of the MMF distribution means that all MMF 
waves are harmonic ones. Therefore, the respective spatial derivative means that 
the current loading waves are harmonic as well (with a phase shift of 90° electri-
cally) and the amplitudes are proportional to the amplitudes of the MMF waves 
multiplied by the respective harmonic number. The result of the harmonic analysis 
of the current loading distribution is shown in Fig. 15.5.

It is obvious that the waves with the harmonic numbers 5 and 7 may be used 
for torque production. Usually, higher harmonics are not used because the slot 
opening effect (that was not regarded in these calculations) increasingly reduces 
the amplitude with rising harmonic number. Using the waves with harmonic num-
ber 5 or 7 as working wave means that 10 or 14 poles are generated (e.g. a wave 
with harmonic number 5 contains 5 complete sinusoidal waves per circumference, 
which means that there are 5 north poles and 5 south poles). 
Using a permanent magnet machine, the number of magnet poles in the rotor 
determines the working wave (please refer to Sect. 3.7: the number of poles of sta-
tor and rotor must be identical to generate a time-independent torque). Using this 
kind of winding with an induction motor (e.g. with a squirrel-cage rotor) torque 
generation will be very problematic, because the rotor adapts itself to any pole 
number of the stator. As the stator generates several pole numbers this will result 
in a very poor torque output. 
If the 5th harmonic is used as working wave, the number of slots per phase per 
pole is according to Eq. (3.3)

Therefore, these kinds of windings are called “fractional slot winding”. 
 
The existence of a large number of MMF harmonics with high amplitudes has 
some severe disadvantages: 
• harmonics with similar, but not identical ordinal number and high amplitudes 
cause radial force waves with high amplitudes and low ordinal number, result-
ing in annoying acoustic noise; 
• for permanent magnet machines the harmonics (and especially the sub-
harmonics with respect to the working wave) cause additional losses, namely 
iron core losses and eddy current losses in electrically conductive permanent 
magnets (like NdFeB or SmCo); 
• for induction machines it will be hardly possible to generate a useful torque, as 
the squirrel-cage rotor adapts to any pole number of the stator.

15.2.1 Increased Number of Stator Slots from 12 to 24 
Because of the severe disadvantages it is necessary to reduce the unwanted har-
monics by far (at least to an amount where their disturbing effect is nearly negligi-
ble). This will be explained exemplarily using the winding described in Sect. 15.1 
and a rotor with 10 poles. Therefore, all low-order harmonics except for the 5th 
one have to be reduced to achieve an acceptable machine behavior.

Fig. 15.6. Winding factors of the first three relevant MMF harmonics as a function of the shifting 
angle (measured in number of stator slots). 
It can be deduced from Fig. 15.6 that reducing the 7th harmonic and maintain-
ing the 5th harmonic results in a shift of the two winding systems of about 2.5 sta-
tor slots.28 As mentioned before, it is only possible to shift the two winding system 
by an integer number of stator slots. To realize the desired shift, the number of sta-
tor slots will be doubled, resulting in a shift of five stator slots. This is illustrated 
in Fig. 15.7. 
The combination of both winding systems is shown in Fig. 15.8. Of course it 
becomes obvious that the resulting winding is no longer purely concentrated, but 
partly overlapping. Nevertheless, this winding has the great advantages that the 
unwanted 7th harmonic is reduced by far and the end winding in circumferential 
direction is maintained as short as for the purely concentrated winding. Even if the 
end winding in total gets a little bit larger compared to the purely concentrated 
winding (because of the partly overlapping design), the end winding Ohmic losses 
are reduced by far compared to a conventional overlapping winding. 
                                                           
28 For a machine with 14 rotor poles the 7th harmonic has to be maintained and the 5th harmonic 
has to be reduced. This results in a shift of the two winding systems of about 3.5 stator slots.

15.9. It becomes obvious that the 7th harmonic is reduced by far.

1. Slightly different tooth widths are used to shift both winding systems a little bit 
more than the 2.5 slots shown in Fig. 15.6, please refer to Fig. 15.10 for a prin-
ciple sketch. This results in completely reducing the 7th harmonic.29 
2. The fundamental wave can be reduced by using different turns per coil for the 
neighbouring phase coils, which is also illustrated in Fig. 15.10.30

harmonic (“wound-off” representation of stator and rotor; only one phase shown for the sake of 
clarity; n1 and n2 denote different number of turns per coil). 
With suitable design and optimization concerning the reduction of the funda-
mental harmonic and the 7th harmonic, an MMF distribution with a very low num-
ber of harmonics can be achieved. Such a design is illustrated in Fig. 15.11, show-
ing the spectrum of the stator MMF distribution. The main advantages of such a 
winding design are: 
• Low Ohmic stator losses because of short end windings. 
• Low eddy current rotor losses because of low harmonic content in the MMF 
spectrum (especially low fundamental MMF harmonic). 
• Low radial forces (as a reason for acoustic noises) because of low harmonic 
MMF waves near to the harmonic number of the working wave. 
• Low torque ripple (please refer to Fig. 15.12). 
• Low production costs because of short end windings and nearly concentrated 
coils. 
 
                                                           
29 Of course, this additional feature can even be used differently. Possible alternatives are the 
maximizing of the 5th harmonic (which is the working wave) or the additional reduction of fur-
ther harmonics that are not shown in Fig. 15.6. 
30 An alternative to reduce the fundamental wave is using coil windings with different turns per 
coil side; this implies that a single coil has to be connected from both axial ends of a radial flux 
machine (however, the phase winding may be still connected from one side).

The main advantages of this kind of winding are illustrated in Figs. 15.12 to 
15.15, presenting a comparison with a conventional distributed wound permanent 
magnet machine (8 poles, 48 stator slots, q
2
=
, short-pitch of one stator slot) for 
the application of an automotive traction drive. 
In Fig. 15.12 the comparison of the torque ripple at low speed is shown, if no 
skewing is used. It is obvious that for many applications the large torque ripple of 
distributed wound machines is not acceptable, therefore e.g. rotor magnet skewing 
has to be introduced (accompanied by the severe disadvantages of lower mean 
torque and higher costs). 
The reduced Ohmic losses in the stator and the reduced eddy current losses in 
the rotor lead to different efficiencies in the torque-speed-plane, see Figs. 15.13 
and 15.14. These results are compared by means of calculating the efficiency dif-
ference in all operating points, shown in Fig. 15.15. It becomes obvious that for 
nearly the entire operating area the new 24 slots / 10 poles winding is advanta-
geous compared to a conventional distributed wound machine. Applications that

15.2.2 Increased Number of Stator Slots from 12 to 18 
Another possibility to improve the MMF spectrum of the winding shown in Sect. 
15.1 is to increase the number of stator slots from 12 to 18 in such a way, that 
within two neighboring stator teeth of the same phase an additional (unwound) 
stator tooth is placed, see Fig. 15.16.  
 
 
 
 
Fig. 15.16. Winding layout of a machine according to Fig. 15.2 with additional teeth (“wound-
off” representation of the stator lamination); red: phase u, yellow: phase v, blue: phase w. 
Afterwards, a similar approach like described in Sect. 15.2.1 is used: The initial 
winding is separated into two identical winding parts, shifted against each other by 
four stator slots. In addition, coils with different turns per coil side are used to re-
duce the fundamental wave.31 The resulting winding layout is illustrated in Fig. 
15.17.

tems shifted against each other (“wound-off” representation of the stator lamination); red: phase 
u, yellow: phase v, blue: phase w. 
The main advantage of this solution against the alternative presented in the pre-
ceding section is that here all coils are concentrated ones wound around a single 
stator tooth. A disadvantage is the higher number of single coils, which increases 
the effort for manufacturing the connections. However, this can be realized fully 
automated. In addition, a new harmonic wave with ordinal number 13 occurs, but 
this will not be an issue if the rotor magnetization is selected suitably. The result-
ing spectrum of the MMF distribution of such a winding is illustrated in the fol-
lowing Fig. 15.18:

15.2.3 Main Characteristics of the Improved Concentrated 
Windings 
Purely concentrated windings generally are characterized by a large number of 
MMF harmonics with high amplitude. As considerable rotor losses and radial 
forces (resulting in acoustic noise) are generated by these harmonics, this kind of 
winding topology is unsuitable for many applications like e.g. in the automotive 
industry (traction, steering, and others), even if the production process of purely 
concentrated windings is beneficial.  
For such applications alternatives are required that are advantageous compared 
to the well-known distributed windings (please refer to Chap. 3) which can be re-
garded as benchmark. The improved concentrated windings described in this 
chapter substantially maintain the advantages of concentrated windings like low 
production effort and short end windings (resulting in compact design and low 
Ohmic stator losses), whereas the disadvantages (high number of harmonics with 
large amplitude) to a large extend are eliminated. Especially the efficiency in part-
load operation conditions can be improved considerably by these winding topolo-
gies, which is important for many industrial applications like pumps, blowers, 
traction drives, etc. Summarizing, these winding topologies are advantageous in 
production and operation of such electrical machines. 
The positive effects of the improved concentrated winding designs were shown 
in this chapter using the example of permanent magnet rotors (synchronous ma-
chines as well as brushless DC machines). However, this kind of winding design
