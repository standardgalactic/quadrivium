Author’s Acknowledgments
I am extremely grateful to the team of talented professionals at John Wiley 
& Sons for all their efforts in putting together this book. Special thanks go to
my awesome project editor, Kim Darosett, who is the type of editor that all
authors hope for but rarely experience: supportive, skilled, and amazingly
calm in the face of any storm, including my not infrequent freakouts.
I also owe much to the rest of the folks in both the editorial and art depart-
ments, especially Heidi Unger, Rashell Smith, Shelley Lea, Steve Hayes, Andy
Cummings, and Mary Bednarek. Thanks, too, to my friends at Canon U.S.A;
to Jonathan Conrad for providing the awesome nighttime shot for Chapter 7,
and to agent extraordinaire, Margot Maley Hutchison, for her continuing help
and encouragement.
Last but oh, so not least, I am deeply indebted to technical editor Chuck
Pace, whose keen eye and vast experience set me on the right track when-
ever I mistakenly thought I should go left. Thank you, thank you, for sharing
your time and your expertise — the book would not have been the same
without it.

Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi/400D For Dummies

Introduction
I
n 2003, when Canon introduced the very first sub-$1000 digital SLR camera,
the EOS Digital Rebel/300D, it revolutionized the camera scene. For the
first time, photography enthusiasts could enjoy the benefits of digital SLR
photography without breaking the bank. And even at the then-unheard-of
price, the camera delivered exceptional performance and picture quality,
earning it rave reviews and multiple industry awards. No wonder it quickly
became a best seller.
That tradition of excellence and value lives on in the EOS Digital Rebel XTi/
400D, known in most circles (and in this book) as simply the Rebel XTi/400D.
For an even lower price than its older brother, this baby offers the range of
advanced controls that experienced photographers demand plus an assort-
ment of tools designed to help beginners to be successful as well.
If you count yourself among the latter camp, you may have a few questions
about how to take advantage of all the features your camera offers, however.
For starters, you may not even be sure what SLR means or how it affects your
picture taking, let alone have a clue as to all the other techie terms you
encounter in your camera manual — resolution, aperture, white balance, 
file format, and so on. And if you’re like many people, you may be so over-
whelmed by all the controls on your camera that you haven’t yet ventured
beyond fully automatic picture-taking mode. Which is a shame because it’s
sort of like buying a Porsche and never actually taking it on the road.
Therein lies the point of Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi/400D For Dummies:
Through this book, you can discover not just what each bell and whistle on
your camera does, but also when, where, why, and how to put it to best use.
Unlike many photography books, this one doesn’t require any previous
knowledge of photography or digital imaging to make sense of things, either.
In classic For Dummies style, everything is explained in easy-to-understand
language, with lots of illustrations to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Canon picture-taking
powerhouse. Whether your interests lie in taking family photos, exploring
nature and travel photography, or snapping product shots for your business,
you’ll get the information you need to capture the images you envision.
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I’ve also tried to make
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics
that interest you in any order you please.

2
Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi/400D For Dummies 
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your
Rebel XTi/400D:
 Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and
customization steps.
 Chapter 2, “Taking Great Pictures, Automatically,” shows you how to get
the best results when using the camera’s fully automatic exposure modes,
including Portrait, Sports, and Landscape modes.
 Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality,” introduces you to one setting
that’s critical whether you shoot in automatic or manual mode: the
Quality setting, which affects resolution (pixel count), file format, file
size, and picture quality.
 Chapter 4, “Reviewing Your Photos,” explains how to view your pictures
on the camera monitor and also how to display various types of picture
information along with the image. In addition, this chapter discusses how
to delete unwanted images and protect your favorites from accidental
erasure.
Part II: Taking Creative Control
Chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your camera
by moving into semiautomatic or manual photography modes.
 Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the all-
important topic of exposure, starting with an explanation of three critical
exposure controls: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. This chapter also
discusses your camera’s advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and 
A-DEP), explains exposure options such as metering mode and exposure
compensation, and offers tips for using the built-in flash.
 Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with control-
ling those aspects of your pictures. Look here for information about
your camera’s manual and autofocusing features as well as details about
color controls such as white balance and the Picture Style options.
 Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results 
for specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscape scenes,
close-ups, and more.

Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos,”
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your
camera memory card to your computer’s hard drive or other storage
device. Just as important, this chapter explains how to organize and
safeguard your photo files. 
 Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Photos,” helps you turn your digi-
tal files into “hard copies,” covering both retail and do-it-yourself print-
ing options. This chapter also explains how to prepare your pictures for
online sharing and, for times when you have the neighbors over, how to
display your pictures on a television screen.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 Chapter 10, “Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks,” shows you how to fix less-
than-perfect images using the free software provided with your camera.
You can find out how to remove red-eye, adjust color and exposure, crop
your photo, and more.
 Chapter 11, “Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,”
presents information about some camera features that, while not found
on most “Top Ten Reasons I Bought My Rebel XTi/400D” lists, are
nonetheless interesting, useful on occasion, or a bit of both.
Appendix: Firmware Facts and Menu Map
Wrapping up the book, the appendix explains how to find out what version of
the Canon firmware, or internal software, is installed in your camera and how
to find and download updates.
If the information you see on your camera menus and other displays isn’t the
same as what you see in this book, and you’ve explored other reasons for 
the discrepancy, a firmware update may be the issue. This book was written
using version 1.1.1 of the firmware, which was the most current at the time of
publication. Firmware updates typically don’t carry major feature changes —
they’re mostly used to solve technical glitches in existing features — but if
you do download an update, be sure to read the accompanying description 
of what it accomplishes so that you can adapt my instructions as necessary.
(Again, changes that affect how you actually operate the camera should be
minimal, if any.)

Introduction

Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi/400D For Dummies 
On a less technical note, the appendix also includes tables that provide brief
descriptions of all commands found on the camera’s five menus.
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large,
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring: 
A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or some
other valuable resource, including your sanity.
When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone that
can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored.
Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital photo-
graphy is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail that is useful
mainly for impressing your technology-geek friends, I mark it with this icon.
I apply this icon either to introduce information that is especially worth stor-
ing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a fact that may
have been displaced from that memory by some other pressing fact.
Additionally, I need to point out two other details that will help you use this
book:
 Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons, dials, con-
trols, and menu graphics also appear in the margins of some paragraphs.
I include these to provide a quick reminder of the appearance of the
button or option being discussed. 
 Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series of
words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose
from the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “Choose
File➪Print, click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the Print com-
mand on the menu.
About the Software Shown in This Book
Providing specific instructions for performing photo organizing and editing
tasks requires that I feature specific software. In sections that cover file
downloading, organizing, printing, and e-mail sharing, I selected Canon

ZoomBrowser EX (for Windows users) and Canon ImageBrowser (for Mac
users). These programs are part of the free software suite that ships with
your camera.
Rest assured, though, that the tools used in ZoomBrowser EX and Image-
Browser work very similarly in other programs, so you should be able to
easily adapt the steps to whatever software you use. (I recommend that you
read your software manual for details, of course.)
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that digi-
tal photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very good
company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take it
slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or tech-
niques at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to
add one or two more shooting skills to your repertoire. 
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really won’t
be long before everything starts to come together. With some time, patience,
and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the necessary
settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book.
Your Rebel XTi/400D is the perfect partner for your photographic journey,
and I thank you for allowing me, through this book, to serve as your tour
guide.

M
aking sense of all the controls on your
Rebel XTi/400D isn’t something you can 
do in an afternoon — heck, in a week, or maybe
even a month. But that doesn’t mean that you
can’t take great pictures today. By using your
camera’s point-and-shoot automatic modes, you
can capture terriﬁc images with very little effort.
All you do is compose the scene, and the camera
takes care of almost everything else.
This part shows you how to take best advantage
of your camera’s automatic features and also
addresses some basic setup steps, such as adjust-
ing the viewﬁnder to your eyesight and getting
familiar with the camera menus, buttons, and
dials. In addition, chapters in this part explain
how to obtain the very best picture quality,
whether you shoot in an automatic or manual
mode, and how to use your camera’s picture-
playback features.

Getting the Lay of the Land
In This Chapter
 Attaching and using an SLR lens
 Adjusting the viewfinder to your eyesight
 Working with camera memory cards
 Getting acquainted with external camera controls
 Using the camera menus and Camera Settings display
 Deciphering viewfinder data
 Customizing basic camera operations
I
still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I was
excited to finally move up from my one-button point-and-shoot camera,
but I was a little anxious, too. My new pride and joy sported several
unfamiliar buttons and dials, and the explanations in the camera
manual clearly were written for someone with an engineering
degree. And then there was the whole business of attach-
ing the lens to the camera, an entirely new task for me. I
saved up my pennies a long time for that camera —
what if my inexperience caused me to damage the
thing before I even shot my first pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Rebel
XTi/400D is your first SLR, although some of the but-
tons on the camera back may look familiar if you’ve
previously used a digital point-and-shoot camera. If
your Canon is both your first SLR and first digital
camera, you may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as compli-
cated as its exterior makes it appear. With a little practice and the
help of this chapter, which introduces you to each external control, you’ll
quickly become as comfortable with your camera’s buttons and dials as you
are with the ones on your car’s dashboard.
This chapter also guides you through the process of mounting and using an
SLR lens, working with digital memory cards, and navigating your camera’s

10
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
internal menus. Finally, the end of the chapter walks you through options
that enable you to customize many aspects of your camera’s basic operation.
Getting Comfortable with Your Lens
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses
to suit different photographic needs, going from an extreme close-up lens to 
a super-long telephoto, for example. In addition, an SLR lens has a movable
focusing ring that gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying
on the camera’s autofocus mechanism. 
Of course, those added capabilities mean that you need a little background
information to take full advantage of your lens. To that end, the next three
sections explain the process of attaching, removing, and using this critical
part of your camera.
Attaching a lens
Your camera can accept two categories of Canon lenses: those with a so-
called EF-S design and those with a plain old EF design.
The EF stands for electro focus; the S, for short back focus. And no, you don’t
really need to remember that little detail — but you do need to make sure
that if you buy a Canon lens other than the one sold with the camera, it car-
ries either the EF or EF-S specification. (If you want to buy a non-Canon lens,
check the lens manufacturer’s Web site to find out which lenses work with
the Rebel XTi/400D.)
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera body:
1. Remove the cap that covers the lens mount on the front of the camera.
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.
3. Locate the proper lens mounting index on the camera body.
A mounting index is simply a marker that tells you where to align the
lens with the camera body when connecting the two. Your camera has
two of these markers, one red and one white, as shown in Figure 1-1.
Which marker you use to align your lens depends on the lens type:
• Canon EF-S lens: Align the lens mounting index with the white
square on the camera body.
• Canon EF lens: Align the lens mounting index with the red dot
instead.

Figure 1-1: Which index marker you should use depends on the lens type.
If you buy a non-Canon lens, check the lens manual for help with this step.
4. Align the mounting index on the lens with the correct one on the
camera body.
The lens also has a mounting index; Figure 1-2 shows the one that appears
on the so-called “kit lens” — the 18–55mm zoom lens that Canon sells as a
unit with the Rebel XTi/400D. If you buy a different lens, the index marker
on the lens may be red or some other color, so again, check the lens
instruction manual.
5. Keeping the mounting indexes aligned, position the lens on the
camera’s lens mount.
When you do so, grip the lens by its back collar as shown in the figure.
6. Turn the lens in a clockwise direction until the lens clicks into place.
In other words, turn the lens toward the lens release button (see
Figure 1-1), as indicated by the red arrow in Figure 1-2.

Figure 1-2: Place the lens in the lens mount with the mounting indexes aligned.
7. On a lens that has an aperture ring, set and lock the ring so the aper-
ture is set at the highest f-number.
Check your lens manual to find out whether your lens sports an aper-
ture ring and how to adjust it. (The Rebel XTi/400D kit lens doesn’t.) To
find out more about apertures and f-stops, see Chapter 5.
Always attach (or switch) lenses in a clean environment to reduce the risk of
getting dust, dirt, and other contaminants inside the camera or lens. Changing
lenses on a sandy beach, for example, isn’t a good idea. For added safety, point
the camera body slightly down when performing this maneuver, as shown 
in the figure; doing so helps prevent any flotsam in the air from being drawn
into the camera by gravity. See Chapter 3 for tips on cleaning your lens.
Removing a lens
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
1. Locate the lens-release button on the front of the camera.
I labeled the button in Figure 1-1.
2. Grip the rear collar of the lens.
In other words, hold onto the stationary part of the lens that’s closest to
the camera body.

3. Press the lens-release button while turning the lens away from the
lens-release button.
You should feel the lens release from the mount at this point. Just lift the
lens off the mount to remove it.
4. Place the rear protective cap onto the back of the lens.
If you aren’t putting another lens on the camera, cover the lens mount
with the protective cap that came with your camera, too.
Focusing and zooming the lens
Like any modern camera, digital or film, yours offers autofocusing capabili-
ties, which you can explore in detail in Chapters 2 and 6. But with some sub-
jects, autofocusing can be slow or impossible, which is why your camera also
offers manual focusing. The process is quick and easy: You just turn the
focusing ring on the lens until your subject comes into focus. 
To try it out, take these steps:
1. Locate the AF/MF switch on the side of the lens.
Figure 1-3 shows you the switch as it appears on the Rebel XTi/400D kit
lens. The switch should be in a similar location on other Canon lenses; 
if you use a lens from another manufacturer, check the lens instruction
manual.
2. Set the switch to the MF position, as shown in the figure.
Don’t try to move the focusing ring with the switch set to the AF (auto-
focus) position; with some lenses, doing so can damage the lens.
3. While looking through the viewfinder, twist the focusing ring to adjust
focus.
The focusing ring is at the far end of the lens barrel, as indicated in
Figure 1-3.
If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every
lens has a minimum focusing distance. (See Chapter 6 for more tips on
focus issues.) You may also need to adjust the viewfinder to accommo-
date your eyesight; see the next section for details.
If you bought a zoom lens, a movable zoom barrel lies behind the focusing
ring, as shown in Figure 1-3. To zoom in or out, just move that zoom barrel
forward and backward.
The numbers on the zoom barrel, by the way, represent focal lengths. I explain
focal lengths in Chapter 6. In the meantime, just note that when the lens is
mounted on the camera, the number that’s aligned with the white focal-length
indicator, labeled in Figure 1-3, represents the current focal length. In Figure 1-3,
for example, the focal length is 55mm.

Figure 1-3: Set the focusing switch to MF before turning the manual 
focus ring.
Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Perched on the top right edge of the viewfinder is a tiny black knob, officially
called the dioptric adjustment control. I labeled the knob in Figure 1-4. With
this control, you can adjust the magnification of the viewfinder to mesh 
with your eyesight. If you don’t take this step, scenes that appear out-of-focus
through the viewfinder may actually be sharply focused through the lens, and
vice versa.
Here’s how to make the necessary adjustment:
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the focusing screen
shown on the right side of Figure 1-4.
The focusing screen is the collective name assigned to the group of nine
autofocus points that appear in the center of the viewfinder — the little
squares with the dots inside. I labeled one of the little guys in Figure 1-4.

Figure 1-4: Use the dioptric adjustment control to set the viewfinder focus for your eyesight.
Don’t worry about focusing the actual picture now; just pay attention to
the autofocus points.
3. Rotate the dioptric adjustment knob until the autofocus points appear
to be in focus.
If your eyesight is such that you can’t get the autofocus points to appear
sharp by using the dioptric adjustment control, you can buy an additional
eyepiece adapter. This accessory, which you pop onto the eyepiece, just
enables further adjustment of the viewfinder display. Prices range from about
$15–30 depending on the magnification you need. Look for an adapter called
an E-series dioptric adjustment lens.
One other note about the viewfinder: See that little black window underneath
the viewfinder — the one labeled Display Off sensor in Figure 1-4? When you
put your eye up to the viewfinder, the sensor tells the camera to turn off the
monitor display, saving you the trouble of doing the job yourself. If the moni-
tor doesn’t turn off automatically, the upcoming section “Setup Menu 1” tells
you how to fix things; see the information related to the LCD Auto Off feature.
Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras store pictures on memory
cards. Some people, in fact, refer to memory cards as digital film, but I hate
that term because film and memory cards actually have little in common.
Film must be developed before you can view your pictures, a process that
involves time and some not-so-nice chemicals. Film can be damaged when
exposed to some airport security scanners; memory cards are immune to
those devices. The cost per picture is also much higher for film: You have to

develop and print each negative, whether the shot is a keeper or a clunker.
With digital, you print only the pictures you like — and you can reuse your
memory cards over and over and over, saving even more money.
Whatever term you prefer, your Canon can use the following two types of
memory cards:
 CompactFlash, or CF, cards: You can use CompactFlash cards that carry
either the Type I or Type II specification. The only difference between
the two card types is thickness; Type II cards are a little thicker than
Type I cards. Type I is the most commonly sold version of the cards
today. In Figure 1-5, you can see one such card in the foreground and
another partially inserted into the camera’s card slot.
 Microdrives: These devices are actually tiny hard drives that are encased
in Type II CompactFlash-style housings. Microdrives are more susceptible
to damage if dropped or exposed to vibration, however, so I don’t really
recommend them. However, if you already own one, feel free to use it,
albeit carefully.
Figure 1-5: Insert the card with the label facing the camera back.

Card-eject button

Safeguarding your memory cards — and the images you store on them —
requires just a few precautions:
 Inserting a card: First, be sure that the camera is turned off. Then put
the card in the card slot with the label facing the back of the camera, as
shown in Figure 1-5. Push the card into the slot until it clicks into place.
The card-eject button — the tiny black push button labeled in the figure —
should pop up. When you close the card-access door, the memory-card
access light, also labeled in Figure 1-5, blinks for a second to let you know
the card is inserted properly. (You probably can’t make it out in the figure,
but the letters CF appear next to the light to remind you of its purpose.)
 Formatting a card: The first time you use a new memory card, take a
few seconds to format it by choosing the Format command from the
camera’s Setup Menu 1. This step simply ensures that the card is prop-
erly prepared to record your pictures. See the upcoming section “Setup
Menu 1” for details.
 Removing a card: After making sure that the memory-card access light
is off, indicating that the camera has finished recording your most recent
photo, turn the camera off. Open the memory-card door, as shown in

Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Do you need high-speed memory cards?
Memory cards are categorized not just by their
storage capacity, but also by their data-transfer
speed. The speed specs you see on memory
cards — 10x, 40x, 80x, 133x, and the like — reflect
the transfer rate compared to a single-speed
CD-ROM, which can move about 156K (kilobytes)
of data per second. So a 10x card, for example, is
10 times faster than that, offering a transfer
speed of 1.5MB (megabytes) per second.
Faster data-transfer speeds reduce the time
your camera needs to write a picture file onto
the card and the time required to download files
from the card to your computer. Of course, card
prices rise along with card speed. And whether
you will really notice much difference depends
on a couple of factors.
On the picture-taking end, users who want to
capture fast-paced action benefit the most from
high-speed cards. Bumping up your card speed
can enable you to fire off a continuous series of
shots at a slightly faster pace than with a slower
card. Users who shoot at the highest resolution
or prefer the Raw file format (CR2 files, on Canon
cameras) also gain the most from high-speed
cards; both options increase file size and, thus,
the time needed to store the picture on the card.
(See Chapter 3 for details.)
When it comes to picture downloading, you may
or may not enjoy much of a speed increase
because transfer time isn’t just dependent on
the card. How long it takes for files to shuffle
from card to computer also depends on the
capabilities of your computer and, if you use a
memory-card reader to download files, on the
speed of that device. (Chapter 8 covers the file-
downloading process.)
To sum up, if you want to push your camera to
its speed limit — and money is no object — go
for a high-speed card. Otherwise, you probably
don’t need to make the extra investment; even a
“slow” card is usually more than fast enough to
satisfy all but the most demanding users.

18
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 1-5. Push in the card-eject button. The card should pop halfway
out of the slot, enabling you to grab it by the tail and remove it.
 Handling cards: When cards aren’t in use, store them in the protective
cases they came in or in a memory card wallet. Keep cards away from
extreme heat and cold as well.
Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are a number of buttons, dials, and
switches that you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your
photos, and perform various other operations. 
In later chapters, I discuss all your camera’s functions in detail and provide
the exact steps to follow to access those functions. This section provides just
a basic road map to the external controls plus a quick introduction to each.
You may want to put a sticky note or other bookmark on this page so that
you can find it for easier reference later. (The cheat sheet at the front of the
book offers a similar guide, albeit with less detail.)
With that preamble out of the way, the next three sections break down the
external controls found on the top, back, and front-left side of the camera.
Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins on the top right side of the camera, shown in 
Figure 1-6. There are five items of note here, as follows:
 On/Off switch: Okay, I’m pretty sure you already figured this one out,
but just move the switch to On to fire up the camera and then back to
Off to shut it down.
By default, the camera automatically shuts itself off after 30 seconds of
inactivity to save battery power. To wake up the camera, just press the
shutter button halfway; you don’t need to use the On/Off switch. You
can adjust the auto shutdown timing via Setup Menu 1, covered later in
this chapter.
 Mode dial: Rotate this dial to select an exposure mode, which determines
whether the camera operates in fully automatic, semi-automatic, or
manual photography mode. The little pictographs, or icons, on the dial
represent Image Zone modes, which are automatic settings geared to spe-
cific types of photos: action shots, portraits, landscapes, and so on.
Canon uses the term Basic Zone to refer to collectively to the Image
Zone modes and Full Auto mode (that’s the one represented by the
green rectangle on the Mode dial). The more advanced modes (P, Tv, Av,
M, and A-DEP) get the label Creative Zone. I think that having all those

zones can be a little confus-
ing, especially because the
modes in the Image Zone
category are often referred
to generically in photogra-
phy discussions as creative
scene mode or creative
modes. So, just to help keep
things a little simpler in this
book, I use the generic
terms fully automatic expo-
sure modes to refer to all the
Basic Zone modes and
advanced exposure modes to
refer to the Creative Zone
modes.
 Main dial: Just forward of
the Mode dial, you see a
black dial that has the offi-
cial name Main dial. This dial
plays such an important role
in choosing camera settings
that you’d think it might
have a more auspicious
name, but Main dial it is. 
 Shutter button: You proba-
bly already understand the
function of this button, too.
But check out Chapter 2 to discover the proper shutter-button-pressing
technique — you’d be surprised how many people mess up their pic-
tures because they press that button incorrectly.
 Red-eye Reduction/Self-timer Lamp: When you set your flash to Red-eye
Reduction mode, this little lamp emits a brief beam of light prior to the
real flash — the idea being that your subjects’ pupils will constrict in
response to the light, thus lessening the chances of red-eye. If you use
the camera’s self-timer feature, the lamp blinks to provide you with a
visual countdown to the moment at which the picture will be recorded.
See Chapter 2 for more details about Red-eye Reduction flash mode and
the self-timer function.
Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back side, you encounter a smor-
gasbord of buttons — 15, in fact, not including the viewfinder’s dioptric
adjustment control, discussed earlier in this chapter. Figure 1-7 gives you a
look at the entire layout of backside controls.

Don’t let the abundance of buttons intimidate you. Having all those external
controls actually makes operating your camera easier. On cameras that have
only a few external buttons, you have to dig through menus to access the
camera features, which is a big pain in the keister. But on your camera, you
can access almost every critical shooting setting via the external buttons.
That’s a convenience you’ll come to appreciate after you familiarize yourself
with all the camera options.
Also, as you look through this book, you may notice that the margins contain
little representations of the buttons to help you locate the one being dis-
cussed. So even though I provide the official control names in the following
list, don’t worry about getting all those straight right now. The list I provide
here is just to get you acquainted with the possibility of what you can accom-
plish with all these features.
Do note, however, that many of the buttons have multiple names because
they serve multiple purposes depending on whether you’re taking pictures,
reviewing images, or performing some other function. In this book, I refer to
these buttons by the first label you see in the following list just to simplify
things. For example, I refer to the AF Point Selection/Enlarge button as the 
AF Point Selection button. Again, though, the margin icons help you know
exactly which button I’m describing.
Figure 1-7: Having lots of external buttons makes accessing the camera’s functions easier.

And here’s another tip: If the label or icon for a button is blue, it indicates
that the button has a function related to viewing, printing, or downloading
images. Black labels indicate a shooting-related function.
With that preamble out of the way, journey with me now over the camera
back, starting at the top right corner and working westward (well, assuming
that your lens is pointing north, anyway):
 AF Point Selection/Enlarge button: When you use certain advanced
shooting modes, you use this button to specify which of the nine autofo-
cus points you want the camera to use when establishing focus. Chapter
6 tells you more about this feature. But in playback mode, you use the
button to magnify the image display (thus the plus sign in the button’s
magnifying glass icon). See Chapter 4 for help with that one.
 AE Lock/FE Lock/Index/Reduce button: As you can guess from the offi-
cial name of this button, it serves many purposes. The first two are
related to image capture functions: You use the button to lock in the auto-
exposure (AE) setting and to lock flash exposure (FE). Chapter 5 details
both issues. The button also serves two playback functions: It switches
the display to index mode, enabling you to view multiple image thumb-
nails at once, and it also reduces the magnification of images when viewed
in single-picture mode. Again, Chapter 4 explains all the playback features. 
 Aperture/Exposure Compensation button: When you work in M (manual)
exposure mode, you press this button and rotate the Main dial to choose
the aperture setting, better known as the f-stop. In the other advanced
exposure modes, you instead use the button and dial to adjust exposure
compensation, a feature that enables you to adjust the exposure selected
by the camera’s autoexposure mechanism. Chapter 5 discusses both
issues.
 Drive mode button: You press this button to access the Drive mode 
setting, which enables you to switch the camera from single-frame
shooting to continuous capture or self-timer/remote-control shooting.
See Chapter 2 for details.
 Set/Picture Style button and cross keys: The Set button and the four
surrounding buttons, known as cross keys, team up to perform several
functions, including choosing options from the camera menus. You use
the cross keys to navigate through menus and then press the Set key to
select a specific menu setting. (The later section, “Ordering from Camera
Menus,” has details.)
In this book, the instruction “Press the left cross key” just means to press
the one that sports the left-pointing arrowhead. “Press the up cross key”
means to press the one with the up-pointing arrowhead, and so on. Also,
the official name for the Set button is Setting button, but I go with just
what’s on the button itself.
21
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land

22
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The cross keys and the Set button also have individual responsibilities,
as follows: 
• Press the Set button to access Picture Style settings. If you press the
button without first displaying any camera menu, you’re taken to
the Picture Style settings screen. Chapter 6 discusses this feature.
• Press the up cross key to adjust ISO. You can read about this 
exposure-related setting in Chapter 5.
• Press the right cross key to adjust the AF mode. This option controls
the camera’s autofocus behavior, as outlined in Chapter 6.
• Press the down cross key to adjust white balance. Chapter 6 also
explains white balance, which is a feature that you can use to
tweak image colors.
• Press the left cross key to change the metering mode. The metering
mode determines which area of the frame the camera uses when
determining the correct exposure settings. Chapter 5 has details.
You can customize the functions of these buttons; Chapter 11 explains
how. But while you’re working with this book, stick with the default
setup, just described. Otherwise, the instructions I give in the book
won’t work.
 Erase button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for delete,
this button lets you erase pictures from your memory card. Chapter 4
has specifics.
 Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture
review mode. Chapter 4 details the camera’s playback features.
 Jump button: If your memory card contains boatloads of images, you
can press this button to “jump” the display forward by 10 or 100 images.
You can even jump through images based on the date pictures were
taken. This button also enables you to toggle between the five camera
menus. Chapter 4 details playback jumping; see the next section for
details on menu jumping.
 Menu button: Press this button to access the camera menus. See the
next section for details on navigating menus; see the appendix for a 
complete listing of all menus and menu options.
 DISP button: The camera monitor turns on automatically when you
press the shutter button halfway, press the Menu button, or press the
Playback button. When you put your eye up to the viewfinder, the dis-
play automatically turns off. If the monitor doesn’t turn off or on as
expected, press this button to kick it into or out of gear.
But that’s just the start of the DISP button’s tricks. If the camera menus
are displayed, pressing the button takes you to the Camera Functions
display, explained in the upcoming section “Monitoring Camera Settings.”
In playback mode, pressing the button changes the picture-display style,
as outlined in Chapter 4. 

 Print/Share button: This button and its accompanying tiny light get
involved in the action when you transfer images to your computer or
print pictures directly from the camera. See Chapter 8 for details on 
the transfer process; check out Chapter 9 for help with printing. 
Front-left buttons
On the front-left side of the camera body, you find three more buttons, all
labeled in Figure 1-8. One, the lens-release button, is key to taking the lens off
the camera body, as discussed earlier in the chapter. The other two buttons
work as follows:
 Flash button: Press this button to bring the camera’s built-in flash out of
hiding when you use the advanced shooting modes. (In fully automatic
modes, the camera pops up the flash without your help if it decides the
flash light is needed.) Chapters 5 and 7 provide tips on flash photography.

out of hiding.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Depth-of-Field Preview button: When you press this button, the image
in the viewfinder offers an approximation of the depth of field that will
result from your selected aperture setting, or f-stop. Depth of field refers
to how much of the scene will be in sharp focus. Chapter 6 provides
details on depth of field, which is an important aspect of your picture
composition. Chapter 5 explains aperture and other exposure settings.
Ordering from Camera Menus
You access many of your camera’s features via internal menus, which, conve-
niently enough, appear when you press the Menu button. Features are grouped
into five main menus, described briefly in Table 1-1. 
Table 1-1

Setup Menu 1
Basic camera-customization options, such 
as monitor brightness and the file-

maintenance functions, such as sensor 
cleaning.
After you press the Menu button, a screen similar to the one shown in
Figure 1-9 appears. Along the top of the screen, you see the icons shown in
Table 1-1, each representing one of the five available menus. The icon that
is highlighted is the active menu; options on that menu automatically appear
on the main part of the screen. In the figure, Shooting Menu 1 is active, for
example.

Shooting Menu 2 does not appear in
the menu display when you set the
camera Mode dial to Full Auto or any 
of the other fully automatic exposure
modes (Portrait, Landscape, Sports,
and so on). You see this menu only
when you use the advanced exposure
modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP). And
some menu items on Setup Menu 2 
are hidden in the fully automatic expo-
sure modes.
I explain all the important menu
options elsewhere in the book; for 
now, just familiarize yourself with the
process of navigating menus and selecting options. Here’s the drill:
 To select a different menu: Press the Jump button to cycle through the
available menus.
 To select and adjust a function on the current menu: Press the up or
down cross key to highlight the feature you want to adjust. On the left
side of Figure 1-10, the Quality option is highlighted, for example. Next,
press the Set button. Settings available for the selected item then appear
either right next to the menu item or on a separate screen, as shown on
the right side of the figure. Either way, use the up and down cross keys
to highlight your preferred setting and then press Set again to lock in
your choice.
In this book, the instruction “Press the left cross key” simply means to
press the cross key to the left of the Set button — the one marked with
the left-pointing arrowhead. “Press the up cross key” means to press the
cross key on the top side of the Set button, and so on.
As an alternative to pressing the cross keys, you can rotate the Main dial
to scroll through menu options.
Figure 1-10: Use the up and down cross keys to highlight an option; press Set to select it.

Again, I present this information just as a general introduction, so don’t worry
about memorizing it. I tell you exactly which button combos to use whenever I
explain a function that you activate via the menus.
Monitoring Critical Camera Settings
As you advance in your photography and begin to move beyond the auto-
matic exposure modes, you need a way to keep track of what camera settings
are currently active. To that end, your camera offers the Camera Settings 
display, shown in Figure 1-11. The display appears automatically when you
turn on the camera and also when you depress the shutter button halfway —
unless your eye is up to the viewfinder. In that case, the display is automati-
cally turned off, but you can monitor some settings in the viewfinder, as
explained in the next section.
If what you see in the figure looks like a big confusing mess, don’t worry. Most
of it won’t mean anything to you until you make your way through later chap-
ters. The figure does label two key points of data that are helpful even in fully
automatic mode, though: how many more pictures can fit on your memory
card at the current settings and the status of the battery. A “full” battery icon
like the one in the figure shows that the battery is fully charged; if the icon
appears empty, go look for your battery charger.

Settings display.

In addition to the Camera Settings dis-
play, you get the Camera Function
Setting display, shown in Figure 1-12.
To display this screen, first display the
camera menus by pressing the Menu
button. Then press the DISP button.
This screen shows you the current
status of the following camera options,
listed from top to bottom in the order
they appear:
 Date/Time: To find out how to
adjust the date and time, jump 
to the upcoming section “Setup
Menu 1.”
 Picture Style: You can use Picture Style options to tweak color, sharp-
ness, and contrast when you shoot in the advanced exposure modes.
Chapter 6 has the lowdown.
 Color Space: Here’s another advanced color option, also explained in
Chapter 6.
 White Balance Shift/Bracketing: Add this to the list of color options
covered in Chapter 6.
 Auto Power Off and Auto Rotate Display: For information on these two
settings, represented in the display by groups of little icons, see the
upcoming section “Setup Menu 1.”
 LCD Monitor Auto Off: This setting, also covered in the section “Setup
Menu 1,” controls whether the monitor turns off automatically when you
put your eye to the viewfinder.
 Memory Card Space Available: The number shown here indicates how
much space remains on your camera memory card. How many pictures
you can fit into that space depends on the Quality setting you select.
Chapter 3 explains this issue.
Of course, with the exception of the last item, you also can simply go to the
menu that contains the option in question to check its current status. The
two displays featured here just give you a quick way to monitor some of the
critical functions.
Decoding Viewfinder Data
When the camera is turned on, you can view critical exposure settings and a
few other pieces of information in the viewfinder as well as on the Camera

Settings display. The viewfinder data changes depending on what action
you’re currently undertaking. For example, when you press the shutter
button halfway, you see the current f-stop (aperture setting), shutter speed,
and exposure meter, as shown in Figure 1-13.
Figure 1-13: You also can view some camera information at 
the bottom of the viewfinder.
The final value (9, in the figure) shows you the number of maximum burst
frames. This number relates to shooting in the continuous-capture mode,
where the camera fires off multiple shots in rapid-fire succession as long as
you hold down the shutter button. (Chapter 2 has details on this mode.) Note
that although the highest number that the viewfinder can display is 9, the
actual number of maximum burst frames may be higher. At any rate, you
don’t really need to pay attention to the number until it starts dropping
toward 0, which indicates that the camera’s memory buffer (its temporary
internal data-storage tank) is filling up. If that happens, just give the camera 
a moment to catch up with your shutter-button finger.
Rather than give you a full guide to all the possible viewfinder readouts here,
which would only boggle your mind and cause lots of unnecessary page-
flipping, I detail the relevant viewfinder data as I cover the various photo-
graphic topics later in the book.

Reviewing Basic Setup Options
You know how sometimes you visit someone’s house and their kitchen cabi-
nets are arranged in a way that doesn’t make sense to you? Why are the mugs
above the microwave instead of above the coffeepot? And wouldn’t it be better
if the serving spoons were next to the stove instead of by the dishwasher?
That’s how I feel about the way that settings that relate to basic camera setup
are organized on the camera menus. They surely make sense to somebody —
namely, I’m guessing, the important somebodies at Canon. But to me, a couple
of the basic setup options are out of place, found on menus other than Setup
Menu 1 or Setup Menu 2, where you might expect to find them. And Setup
Menu 2 offers some options that are related more to advanced exposure con-
trols than basic camera operation.
Well, I can’t rearrange the menus for you any more than I can put those mugs
near the coffeemaker, so instead, the following sections describe the basic
customization options found on the aforementioned Setup Menu 1 and 2, plus
two additional options found on Shooting Menu 1.
If you don’t yet know how to select options from the menus, see the earlier
section, “Ordering from Camera Menus” for help.
Setup Menu 1
At the risk of being labeled conven-
tional, I suggest that you start your
camera customization by opening this
menu, shown in Figure 1-14.
Here’s a quick rundown of each menu
item:
 Auto Power Off: To help save
battery power, your camera auto-
matically powers down after a
certain period of inactivity. By
default, the shutdown happens
after 30 seconds, but you can
change the shutdown delay to 1,
2, 4, 8, or 15 minutes. Or you can disable auto shutdown altogether by
selecting the Off setting.
29
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Figure 1-14: Options on Setup Menu 1 deal
mainly with basic camera behavior.

30
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Auto Rotate: If you enable this feature, your picture files include a piece
of data that indicates whether the camera was oriented in the vertical or
horizontal position when you shot the frame. Then, when you view the
picture on the camera monitor or on your computer, the image is auto-
matically rotated to the correct orientation.
To automatically rotate images both in the camera monitor and on your
computer monitor, stick with the default setting. In the menu, this set-
ting is represented by On followed by a camera icon and a monitor icon,
as shown in Figure 1-14. If you want the rotation to occur just on your
computer and not on the camera, select the second On setting, which is
marked with the computer monitor symbol but not the camera symbol.
To disable rotation for both devices, choose the Off setting.
Note, though, that the camera may record the wrong orientation data for
pictures that you take with the camera pointing directly up or down.
Also, whether your computer can read the rotation data in the picture
file depends on the software you use; the programs bundled with the
camera can perform the auto rotation.
 LCD Brightness: This option enables you to make the camera monitor
brighter or darker, as shown in Figure 1-15. After highlighting the option
on the menu, press Set to display a screen similar to what you see on 
the right screen in the figure. (The camera displays a picture from your
memory card in the main preview area; if the card is empty, you see a
black box instead.) Press the right and left cross keys to adjust the
brightness setting. Press Set again to return to the menu.
If you take this step, keep in mind that what you see on the display may
not be an accurate rendition of the actual exposure of your image. Crank
up the monitor brightness, for example, and an underexposed photo
may look just fine. So I recommend that you keep the brightness at the
default setting, which places the brightness marker at dead center on
the little brightness scale, as shown in Figure 1-15. As an alternative, you
can display the histogram, an exposure guide that I explain in Chapter 4,
when reviewing your images.
Figure 1-15: You can adjust the brightness of the camera monitor.

 LCD Auto Off: When the Enable setting is selected, as it is by default,
the camera automatically turns off the camera monitor when you put
your eye up to the camera viewfinder. (The little sensor underneath the
viewfinder notes the presence of your eye and signals the camera to
turn off the monitor.) You can deactivate this feature by choosing the
Disable setting if you prefer. The monitor is one of the biggest battery
drains on the camera, however, so in my opinion, the auto shutoff fea-
ture is a good thing.
 Date/Time: When you turn on your camera for the very first time, it
automatically displays this option and asks you to set the current date
and time.
Keeping the date/time accurate is important because that information is
recorded as part of the image file. In your photo browser, you can then
see when you shot an image and, equally handy, search for images by
the date they were taken. Chapter 8 shows you where to locate the date/
time data when browsing your picture files.
 File Numbering: This option controls how the camera names your picture
files. When the option is set to Continuous, as it is by default, the camera
numbers your files sequentially, from 0001 to 9999, and places all images
in the same folder. The initial folder name is 100Canon; when you reach
image 9999, the camera creates a new folder, named 101Canon, for your
next 9999 photos. This numbering sequence is retained even if you change
memory cards, which helps to ensure that you don’t wind up with multi-
ple images that have the same file name.
By contrast, the Auto Reset option automatically starts file numbering at
0001 each time you put in a different memory card. I discourage the use
of this option, for the reason already stated.
Whichever of these two options you choose, beware one gotcha: If you
swap out memory cards and the new card already contains images, the
camera may pick up numbering from the last image on the new card,
which throws a monkey wrench into things. To avoid this problem, just
format the new card before putting it into the camera. (See the next
bullet point for details.)
Finally, if you choose Manual Reset, the camera begins a new numbering
sequence, starting at 0001, for your next shot. The Continuous mode is
then automatically selected for you again.
 Format: The first time you insert a new memory card, you should use
this option to format the card, a maintenance function that wipes out
any existing data on the card and prepares it for use by the camera.
If you previously used your card in another device, such as a digital
music player, be sure to copy those files to your computer before you
format the card.

Setup Menu 2
Setup Menu 2, shown in Figure 1-16,
offers an additional batch of customiza-
tion options. But you can adjust and
take advantage of only the following
three options in all exposure modes
(Full Auto, Manual, Portrait, and so on):
 Language: This option determines
the language of any text displayed
on the camera monitor. Screens in
this book display the English lan-
guage, but I find it entertaining on
occasion to hand my camera to a
friend after changing the language
to, say, Swedish. I’m a real yoke-
ster, yah?
 Video System: This option is related to viewing your images on a televi-
sion, a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in North
America or other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard;
select PAL for playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
 Sensor Cleaning:Auto: By default, the camera’s sensor-cleaning mecha-
nism activates each time you turn the camera on and off. This process
helps keep the image sensor — which is the part of the camera that 
captures the image — free of dust and other particles that can mar your
photos. You have the option of turning the feature off, but I can’t imagine
why you would choose to do so.
That leaves the following four options which, again, you cannot access in the
fully automatic exposure modes:
 Custom Functions: Selecting this option opens the door to customizing
11 camera functions, which are labeled on the menu as C.Fn-1, C.Fn-2,
and so on. These functions either relate to advanced exposure options
or are otherwise designed for people with some photography experi-
ence. I cover functions 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 in Chapter 5, which explains the
advanced exposure modes; I detail the remaining Custom Functions in
Chapter 11.
 Clear Settings: You can restore the default settings that are used for the
advanced exposure modes via this menu option. You also can reset all
the Custom Functions settings to their defaults through this option.
 Sensor Cleaning:Manual: This feature enables you to clean the image
sensor manually, by opening up the camera and using special tools to 
Figure 1-16: Most options on Setup Menu 2
can be used only in advanced exposure
modes.

do the job. My advice on this procedure can be summed up in one word:
Don’t. The sensor is extremely delicate, and this is a task best left to 
professional camera technicians. Expect to pay about $30 to $50 for the
service. (Some stores, however, provide sensor cleaning free if you pur-
chased your camera from them.)
 Firmware Ver.: This screen tells you the current version of the camera
firmware (internal operating software). The appendix in this book
explains how to check which version is installed in your camera and
how to update it via the Canon Web site if needed.
Keeping your camera firmware up-to-date is pretty important, and I sug-
gest that you skip to the appendix and do a firmware check now even if
you’re not ready to actually use the advanced exposure modes. That
way, you can be confident that you’re taking advantage of the most
recent internal software.
Two more customization options
Shooting Menu 1, shown in Figure 1-17,
offers two more basic setup options —
at least, these options fall into that cat-
egory if you share my logic, which
some may consider a frightening
prospect. At any rate, these two
options work as follows:
 Beep: By default, your camera
beeps at you after certain opera-
tions, such as after it sets focus
when you shoot in autofocus
mode. If you’re doing top-secret
surveillance work and need the
camera to hush up, set this
option to Off.
 Shoot w/o Card: Setting this option to Off prevents shutter-button
release when no memory card is in the camera. If you turn the option 
on, you can take a picture and then review the results for a few seconds
in the camera monitor. The image isn’t stored anywhere, however; it’s
temporary.
If you’re wondering about the point of this option, it’s designed for use
in camera stores, enabling salespeople to demonstrate cameras without
having to keep a memory card in every model. Unless that feature some-
how suits your purposes, keep this option set to Off.

Why does this camera have two names?
As is the case with some other Canon cameras,
yours goes by different names — EOS Digital
Rebel XTi or EOS 400D — depending on the part
of the world where it’s sold.
The EOS part, by the way, stands for Electro
Optical System, the core technology used in
Canon’s autofocus SLR (single-lens reflex) cam-
eras. According to Canon, the proper pronuncia-
tion is ee-ohs, which is also how you pronounce
the name Eos, the goddess of dawn in Greek
mythology. 
With apologies to the goddess, I save a little
room in this book by shortening the camera
name to simply Rebel XTi/400D, which is already
long enough.

re you old enough to remember the Certs television commercials
from the 1960s and ’70s? “It’s a candy mint!” declared one
actor. “It’s a breath mint!” argued another. Then a narrator
declared the debate a tie and spoke the famous catch-
phrase: “It’s two, two, two mints in one!”
Well, that’s sort of how I see the Rebel XTi/400D. On
one hand, it provides a full range of powerful con-
trols, offering just about every feature a serious 
photographer could want. On the other, it also
offers fully automated exposure modes that enable
people with absolutely no experience to capture
beautiful images. “It’s a sophisticated photographic
tool!” “It’s as easy as ‘point and shoot!’” “It’s two, two,
two cameras in one!”
Now, my guess is that you bought this book for help with your
camera’s advanced side, so that’s what other chapters cover. This
chapter, however, is devoted to your camera’s simpler side, because even
when you shoot in the fully automatic modes, following a few basic guidelines
can help you get better results. For example, your camera offers a variety of
fully automatic exposure modes, some of which may be new to you. The mode
affects the look of your pictures, so this chapter explains those options. I also
cover techniques that enable you to get the best performance from your

36
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
camera’s autofocus and autoexposure systems and review the flash options
available to you in automatic modes.
Getting Good Point-and-Shoot Results
Your camera offers several fully automatic exposure modes, all of which I
explain later in this chapter. But in any of those modes, the key to good
photos is to follow a specific picture-taking technique.
To try it out, set the Mode dial on top of the camera to Full Auto, as shown in
the left image in Figure 2-1. Then set the focusing switch on the lens to the 
AF (autofocus) position, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-1. (The figure
features the lens that is bundled with the Rebel XTi/400D. If you own a differ-
ent lens, the switch may look and operate differently; check your lens manual
for details.)
Figure 2-1: Choose these settings for fully automatic exposure and focus.
Your camera is now set up to work in the most automatic of automatic
modes. Follow these steps to take the picture:
1. Looking through the viewfinder, frame the image so that your subject
appears under an autofocus point.
The autofocus points are those nine tiny rectangles clustered in the
center of the viewfinder, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Full Auto mode
AF/MF switch

2. Press and hold the shut-
ter button halfway down.
The camera’s autofocus
and autoexposure meters
begin to do their thing. In
dim light, the flash may
pop up if the camera
thinks additional light is
needed. Additionally, the
flash may shoot out an 
af-assist beam, emitting a
few rapid pulses of light
designed to help the auto-
focusing mechanism find
its target. (The af stands
for autofocus.)
When focus is established,
the camera beeps at you,
assuming that you didn’t
silence its voice via
Shooting Menu 1, as dis-
cussed at the end of
Chapter 1. Additionally,
the focus indicator in the
viewfinder lights, as
shown in Figure 2-3, and
the dot inside one autofo-
cus point starts to blink
red. That blinking dot 
indicates which autofocus
point the camera used to
establish focus. Some-
times multiple dots blink,
which simply tells you
that all the objects within
those autofocus areas are
now in focus.
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down to record the image.
While the camera sends the image data to the camera memory card, the
memory card access lamp lights, as shown in Figure 2-4. Don’t turn off
the camera or remove the memory card while the lamp is lit, or you may
damage both camera and card.
When the recording process is finished, the picture appears briefly on
the camera monitor. See Chapter 4 to find out how to switch to playback
mode and take a longer look at your image.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
I need to add a couple important notes
about this process, especially related 
to Step 2:
 Solving autofocus problems: When
you shoot in the fully automatic
modes, the camera typically focuses
on the closest object. If the camera
insists on selecting an autofocus point
that isn’t appropriate for your subject,
the easiest solution is to switch to
manual focusing and be done with it.
Chapter 1 shows you how. Or you can
use the advanced exposure modes,
which enable you to select a specific
autofocus point. Chapter 6 explains
that option plus a few other tips for
getting good autofocus results.
 Shooting moving subjects: If the focus
indicator doesn’t light but you hear a
continuous series of beeps, the camera’s telling you that it detected
motion in the scene. To accommodate that motion, it shifts to an autofo-
cusing mode called AI Servo (the AI stands for artificial intelligence). In
this mode, the camera focuses continually after you press the shutter
button halfway. As long as you keep the subject within one of the autofo-
cus points, focus should be correct. See Chapter 6 for more tips about
this and other autofocus modes.
 Locking exposure: By default, pressing the shutter button halfway does
not lock exposure along with focus. Your camera instead continues
metering and adjusting exposure until you fully depress the shutter
button. If you want to lock exposure, you must use an advanced expo-
sure mode and rely on the AE (autoexposure) Lock button. Again, see
Chapter 5 for how-to’s. Alternatively, you can set up the shutter button
to lock exposure instead of focus; Chapter 11 explains this option, avail-
able through one of the Custom Functions. (While working with this
book, however, stick with the default arrangement.)
 Changing the Drive mode setting: In most of the automatic exposure
modes, your camera automatically sets the Drive mode to Single, which
records a single image with each press of the shutter button. But in
Portrait and Sports mode, the camera instead selects Continuous mode,
which records pictures as long as you hold down the shutter button.
You can change the Drive mode to the Self-Timer/Remote Control setting
for any exposure mode, however. See the end of this chapter for details.
Memory card access lamp
Figure 2-4: The card access lamp lights
while the camera sends the picture data
to the card.

Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes
Your options for using flash depend on which of the fully automatic exposure
modes you choose, as follows:
 Sports, Landscape, and Flash Off: Flash is disabled for these modes. For
the Flash Off mode, that behavior makes sense, of course. But why no
flash in the other two modes? Well, Sports mode is designed to enable
you to capture moving subjects, and the flash can make that more diffi-
cult because it needs time to recycle between shots. Additionally, action
photos usually aren’t taken at a range close enough for the flash to reach
the subject, which is also the reason why flash is disabled for Landscape
mode.
 Full Auto, Portrait, Close Up, and Night Portrait: In these modes, the
camera automatically pops up the built-in flash when needed. You do
have the option of setting the flash to either normal or Red-eye Reduction
mode, however. You can do this via the Red-Eye On/Off setting on
Shooting Menu 1, shown on the left in Figure 2-5.
39
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, either in autofocus or
manual focus mode, you determine only the point
of sharpest focus. The distance to which that
sharp-focus zone extends — what photogra-
phers call the depth of field — depends in part on
the aperture setting, which is an exposure con-
trol. And the aperture setting varies depending on
the automated photography mode you select.
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so that
background objects are softly focused — an
artistic choice that most people prefer for por-
traits. On the flip side of the coin, the Landscape
setting selects an aperture that produces a large
depth of field so that both foreground and back-
ground objects appear sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter speed,
plays a focus role when you photograph moving
objects. Moving objects appear blurry at slow
shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds, they
appear sharply focused. On your camera, the
Sports shooting mode automatically selects a
high shutter speed to help you “stop” action, pro-
ducing blur-free shots of the subject.
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard
against allover blurring that results when the
camera is moved during the exposure. The faster
the shutter speed, the shorter the exposure time,
which reduces the time that you need to keep the
camera absolutely still. Using a tripod is the best
way to avoid the problem when you use a slow
shutter speed. 
If you want to manipulate focus and depth of field
to a greater extent than the automated exposure
modes produce, visit Chapter 6. For an explana-
tion of the role of shutter speed and aperture in
exposure, check out Chapter 5.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 2-5: Turn Red-eye Reduction flash mode on and off via Shooting Menu 1.
In Red-eye Reduction mode, the camera fires a brief preflash when you
press the shutter button halfway. The purpose of this light is to attempt
to shrink the subject’s pupils, which helps reduce the chances of red-
eye. So be sure to warn your subjects to keep posing until the second,
real flash light fires. See Chapters 5 and 7 for more tips about using your
flash.
When the flash is set to red-eye reduction mode, you see the universal “red-
eye” icon in the Camera Settings display, as shown on the right in Figure 2-5.
Additionally, the viewfinder displays the following symbols to alert you to the
flash status:
 Flash on: A little lightning
bolt like the one you see in
the margin here and in the
highlighted area of Figure
2-6 tells you that the flash
is enabled.
 Flash recycling: If you see
the word Busy along with
the lightning bolt, as
shown in Figure 2-6, the
flash needs a few moments
to recharge. When the flash
is ready to go, the Busy
message disappears.
 Red-eye signal: After you
press the shutter button
halfway in Red-eye Reduction flash mode, a row of vertical bars appears
in the lower right half of the viewfinder display. A few instants later, the
bars turn off one by one. For best results, wait until all the bars are off to
take the picture. (The delay gives the subject’s pupils time to constrict.)
Red-eye Reduction flash symbol

Exploring Your Automatic Options
You can choose from seven fully
automatic exposure modes, all of
which you access via the Mode dial
on the top of the camera, shown in
Figure 2-7.
The next sections provide details on
each of these options. For informa-
tion about the five other settings 
on the Mode dial — P (Programmed
Auto), Tv (shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure), Av (aperture-priority auto-
exposure), M (manual exposure), 
and A-DEP (automatic depth-of-field
autoexposure), see Chapter 5.
Full Auto mode
In this mode, represented on the
Mode dial by the green rectangle you
see in the margin here, the camera
selects all settings based on the scene that it detects in front of the lens. Your
only job is to lock in focus, using the two-stage autofocus technique I outline
at the beginning of the chapter, or by setting the lens to manual mode and
using the focus ring on the lens, as explained in Chapter 1.
Full Auto mode is great for casual, quick snapshooting. But keep these limita-
tions in mind:
 Picture Style: Full Auto mode records your photo using the Standard
Picture Style setting. The aim of this mode is to produce a crisp, vivid
image. You can get more details about how Picture Styles affect your
photos in Chapter 6.
 Drive mode: The camera selects the Single setting automatically, so you
record one image for every press of the shutter button. For information
on how to change the setting to Self-Timer/Remote Control, see the last
section in this chapter.
 Flash: The camera takes control over whether you can use flash. You
can’t enable the flash if the camera’s autoexposure meter doesn’t sense
that additional light is needed. Nor can you disable the flash or adjust its
intensity, a feature I cover in Chapter 5. You can, however, choose to use
Red-eye Reduction flash mode; see the preceding section for details.
 Autofocus control: In most cases, the camera focuses on the object clos-
est to it. To focus on a different area, the easiest option is to switch to
manual focusing.

Fully automatic exposure modes
Figure 2-7: You can select from seven fully

42
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
If you do stick with autofocus, note that the camera adjusts its auto-
focusing behavior depending on whether it thinks you’re shooting a still
or moving subject. For still subjects, the camera locks focus when you
depress the shutter halfway. But if the camera senses motion, it continu-
ally adjusts focus from the time you depress the shutter button halfway.
You must reframe your shot as necessary to keep the subject within one
of the nine autofocus points to ensure sharp focus.
See Chapter 6 for additional information on getting good autofocus
results.
 Color: You can’t adjust color. If the image displays a color cast, you must
switch to a mode that enables you to adjust the White Balance setting,
covered in Chapter 6.
 Exposure: You also give up total control over exposure to the camera.
Chapter 5 shows you what you’re missing.
 Quality: For the Quality setting, which determines both the image reso-
lution, or pixel count, and the file format, you are limited to settings that
use the JPEG file format. Chapter 3 discusses this issue.
I purposely didn’t include an example of a photo taken in Full Auto mode
because, frankly, the results that this setting create vary widely depending 
on how well the camera detects whether you’re trying to shoot a portrait,
landscape, action shot, or whatever. But the bottom line is that Full Auto is a
one-size-fits-all approach that may not take best advantage of your camera’s
capabilities. So if you want to more consistently take great pictures instead 
of good ones, I encourage you to explore the exposure, focus, and color infor-
mation found in Part II so that you can abandon this exposure mode in favor
of ones that put more photographic decisions in your hands.
Automatic scene modes (a.k.a. Image Zone modes)
In Full Auto mode, the camera tries to figure out what type of picture you
want to take by assessing what it sees through the lens. If you don’t want to
rely on the camera to make that judgment, your camera offers six other fully
automatic modes that are specifically designed for taking popular categories
of pictures. For example, most people prefer portraits that have softly focused
backgrounds. So in Portrait mode, the camera selects settings that can pro-
duce that type of background. 
These six automatic modes — the ones represented by the little pictographs
on the Mode dial — are officially known as Image Zone modes in Canon lingo
and in your camera manual. For reasons I state in Chapter 1, I avoid using the
whole “zone” moniker system in this book and instead refer to the six Image
Zone modes as automatic scene modes. But if you should seek information
about these modes elsewhere, whether online or in your manual, be sure to
search for the topic under its official name. 

Whatever you call them, all six modes share a few limitations — or benefits,
depending on how you look at things: 
 Color: As with Full Auto mode, you can’t tweak color. Some modes
manipulate colors in ways that you may or may not appreciate, and
you’re stuck if you have a color cast problem.
 Exposure: The camera takes complete control of exposure, too.
 Quality: You can’t take advantage of the Raw file format (CR2, on your
Canon); you must use the JPEG format. See Chapter 3 to find out which
of the JPEG settings is most appropriate for the way you plan to use
your pictures.
In the next sections, you can read about the unique features of each of the six
automatic scene modes. To see whether you approve of how your camera
approaches the different scenes, take some test shots. If you aren’t happy
with the results, you can switch to one of the advanced exposure modes and
then check out Chapters 5–7 to find out how to manipulate whatever aspect
of the picture isn’t to your liking.
Portrait mode
Portrait mode attempts to select exposure settings that produce a blurry
background, which puts the visual emphasis on your subject. Figure 2-8
offers an example. Keep in mind, though, that in certain lighting conditions,
the camera may not be able to choose the exposure settings that best pro-
duce the soft background. Additionally, the background blurring requires that
your subject be at least a few feet from the background. The extent to which
the background blurs also depends on the other depth-of-field factors that I
discuss in Chapter 6.
In addition, Portrait mode selects these camera settings:
 Picture Style: Logically enough, the camera automatically sets the
Picture Style option to Portrait. As detailed in Chapter 6, this Picture
Style results in a slightly less sharp image, the main idea being to keep
skin texture nice and soft. Colors are also adjusted subtly to enhance
skin tones.
 Drive mode: Contrary to what you may expect, the Drive mode is set to
Continuous, which means that the camera records a series of images in
rapid succession as long as you hold down the shutter button. This
technique can come in especially handy if your portrait subject can’t be
counted on to remain still for very long — a toddler or pet, for example.
Should you want to include yourself in the shot, you can switch the Drive
mode setting to the Self-Timer/Remote Control mode. See the end of this
chapter for details.

Figure 2-8: Portrait setting produces a softly focused background.
 Flash: You have the option of using regular or Red-Eye Reduction mode —
but only if the camera decides that you need a flash to properly light the
scene.
For outdoor portraits, this can pose a problem: A flash generally improves
outdoor portraits, and if the ambient light is very bright, the camera
doesn’t give you access to the flash. For an illustration of the difference
a flash can make, see Chapter 7. That chapter also contains tips on using
flash in nighttime and indoor portraits.
 Autofocusing: Portrait mode employs the One-Shot AF (autofocus) mode.
This is one of three AF modes available on your camera, all detailed in
Chapter 6. In One-Shot mode, the camera locks focus when you press the
shutter button halfway. Typically, the camera locks focus on the object
that’s closest to the camera. If your subject moves out of the selected
autofocus point, the camera doesn’t adjust focus to compensate.
Keep in mind that you can use Portrait mode any time you want a slightly
blurry background, not just for people pictures. Try this mode when shooting
statues, still-life arrangements (such as a vase of flowers on a kitchen table),
and the like. And one more tip: If you’re not sure that your subject will remain
motionless, Sports mode, which is designed to capture moving subjects with-
out blur, may deliver better results. I often suggest this mode for shooting
children and pets, for example.

Landscape mode
Whereas Portrait mode aims for a very shallow depth of field (small zone of
sharp focus), Landscape mode, which is designed for capturing scenic vistas,
city skylines, and other large-scale subjects, produces a large depth of field.
As a result, objects both close to the camera and at a distance appear sharply
focused. Figure 2-9 offers an example. Notice that everything from the fore-
ground saplings to the architectural ruins to the background trees appear
about the same in terms of sharpness.
Like Portrait mode, Landscape mode achieves the greater depth of field by
manipulating the exposure settings — specifically, the aperture, or f-stop set-
ting. So the extent to which the camera can succeed in keeping everything in
sharp focus depends on the available light. To fully understand this issue, see
Chapter 6. And in the meantime, know that you also can extend depth of field
by zooming out, if your camera offers a zoom lens.
Figure 2-9: Landscape mode produces a large 
zone of sharp focus and also boosts color 
intensity slightly.
45
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically

46
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
As for other camera settings, Landscape mode results in the following options:
 Picture Style: The camera automatically sets the Picture Style option to
Landscape, which produces a sharper image, with well-defined “edges” —
the borders between areas of contrast or color change. The Picture Style
setting also produces more vivid blues and greens, which is what most
people prefer from their landscape photos. You can read more about
Picture Styles in Chapter 6.
 Drive mode: The camera selects the Single option, which records one
image for each press of the shutter button. As with the other scene
modes, you can switch to self-timer or remote-control shooting by fol-
lowing the steps laid out at the end of this chapter.
 Flash: The built-in flash is disabled, which is typically no big deal: Because
of its limited range, a built-in flash is of little use when shooting most
landscapes anyway.
 Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot, which means that focus
is locked when you depress the shutter button halfway. (See Chapter 6
for details.) Focus usually is set on the nearest object, but remember
that because of the large depth of field that the Landscape mode pro-
duces, both far and near objects may appear equally sharp, depending
on their distance from the lens.
Again, think beyond the Landscape moniker when you look for good ways to
put this mode to use: Try it when shooting long-range pictures of animals at
the zoo, for example, so that critters both near and far appear sharp.
Close-Up mode
Switching to Close-Up mode doesn’t enable you to focus at a closer distance
to your subject than normal as it does on some non-SLR cameras. The close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you bought.
But choosing Close-Up mode does result in exposure settings that are designed
to blur background objects so that they don’t compete for attention with
your main subject. As with Portrait mode, though, how much the background
blurs varies depending on the distance between your subject and the back-
ground as well as on the lighting conditions.
For example, the amount of background blurring in the Close-Up mode exam-
ple shown in Figure 2-10 isn’t as great as in the earlier Portrait example
because not as much distance exists between subject and background. Still,
you can see a slight shift in focus from the front of the wagon wheel to the
blue wagon bed behind it. Should you prefer a greater or shorter depth of
field, see Chapter 6 for other ways to adjust this aspect of your pictures.

Other settings selected for you in Close-Up mode are as follows:
 Picture Style: Close-Up mode
uses the Standard picture
style, just like Full Auto. The
resulting image features crisp
edges and vivid colors.
 Drive mode: The Drive mode
is set to Single, so you record
one photo each time you fully
depress the shutter button.
You can, however, select Self-
Timer/Remote Control mode 
if needed.
 Flash: Flash is enabled when
the camera thinks additional
light is needed and disabled if
not. You can set the flash to
Red-Eye Reduction mode, but
frankly, you shouldn’t be firing
the flash at close range to
either human or animal sub-
jects — you can hurt their
eyes.
 Autofocusing: The AF mode is
set to One-Shot mode; again,
that simply means that when
you depress the shutter
button halfway, the camera
locks focus, usually on the nearest object.
See Chapter 6 for more details about AF modes and other focusing issues.
Chapter 7 offers additional tips on close-up photography.
Sports mode
Sports mode results in a number of settings that can help you photograph
moving objects such as the swinging girl in Figure 2-11. First, the camera
selects a fast shutter speed, which is needed to “stop motion.” Shutter speed
is an exposure control that you can explore in Chapter 5.
Also keep these Sports mode settings in mind:
 Picture Style: The camera automatically sets the Picture Style option to
Standard, the same one used for Full Auto and Close-Up mode. This pic-
ture style is designed to produce sharp images with bold colors.
47
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Figure 2-10: Close-Up mode also produces short
depth of field.

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Drive mode: To enable rapid-
fire image capture, the Drive
mode is set to Continuous.
This mode enables you to
record multiple frames with 
a single press of the shutter
button. You also have the
option of switching to the 
Self-Timer/Remote Control
mode. Check out the end of
this chapter for details on
both Drive mode settings.
 Flash: Flash is disabled, which
can be a problem in low-light
situations, but it also enables
you to shoot successive
images more quickly because
the flash needs a brief period
to recycle between shots. 
 Autofocusing: The AF mode is
set to AI Servo. In this mode,
the camera establishes focus
initially when you depress the
shutter button halfway. But if
the subject moves, the camera
attempts to refocus.
For this feature to work cor-
rectly, you must adjust framing so that your subject remains within one
of the autofocus points. You may find it easier to simply switch to manual
focusing and twist the focusing ring as needed to track the subject’s
movement yourself. 
The other critical thing to understand about Sports mode is that whether the
camera can select a shutter speed fast enough to stop motion depends on 
the available light and the speed of the subject itself. In Figure 2-11, the camera
selected a shutter speed that did, in fact, catch my subject in midswing,
although if you look very closely, you can see some slight blurring of the foot
near the bottom of the frame.
To fully understand shutter speed, visit Chapter 6. And for more tips on
action photography, check out Chapter 7.
Figure 2-11: To capture moving subjects without
blur, try Sports mode.

Night Portrait mode
As its name implies, Night Portrait mode is designed to deliver a better-looking
portrait at night (or in any dimly lit environment). It does so by combining
flash with a slow shutter speed. That slow shutter speed produces a longer
exposure time, which enables the camera to rely more on ambient light and
less on the flash to expose the picture. The result is a brighter background
and softer, more even lighting.
I cover the issue of using a slow shutter speed in detail in Chapter 5; Chapter 7
has some additional nighttime photography tips. For now, the critical thing to
know is that the slower shutter speed means that you probably need a tripod;
if you try to handhold the camera, you run the risk of moving the camera
during the long exposure, resulting in a blurry image. Your subjects also 
must stay perfectly still during the exposure, which can also be a challenge.
If you do try Night Portrait mode, be aware of these other settings that are
automatically selected by the camera:
 Picture Style: The Standard setting, designed to deliver sharp, bold
photos, is selected. See Chapter 6 for more about Picture Style options
and how they affect your images.
 Drive mode: The default setting is Single, but you also can choose the
Self-Timer/Remote Control mode. Check out the end of this chapter for
details on both Drive mode settings.
 Flash: Flash is enabled when the camera thinks ambient light is needed —
which, assuming that you’re actually shooting at night, should be most
of the time. You can set the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode if you
prefer. See the section “Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes,” ear-
lier in this chapter, for details. 
 Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot, which locks focus when
you depress the shutter button halfway. Focus isn’t adjusted if your sub-
ject moves out of the selected autofocusing point before you record the
image.
Flash Off mode
The Flash Off mode delivers the same results as Full Auto mode but ensures
that the flash doesn’t fire, even in dim lighting. This mode provides an easy
way to ensure that you don’t break the rules when shooting in locations that
don’t permit flash: museums, churches, and so on. But it can also come in
handy any time you prefer not to use flash. See Chapters 5 and 7 for informa-
tion about flash photography.

Changing the Drive Mode
Your camera offers three Drive mode settings, which work as follows:
 Single: This setting, which is the default for all of the fully automatic
modes except Portrait and Sports, records a single image each time you
press the shutter button. In other words, this is normal-photography
mode.
 Continuous: Sometimes known as burst mode, this setting records a con-
tinuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter button.
On the Rebel XTi/400D, you can capture as many as three shots per
second. Obviously, this mode is great for capturing fast-paced subjects,
which is why it’s the default setting for Sports mode. It’s also the selected
option for Portrait mode, which is a great benefit if your subject is the
fidgety type. (See Chapter 7 for more action-photography tips.)
 Self-Timer/Remote Control: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select
this mode and then press the shutter button and run into the frame. 
You have about 10 seconds to get yourself in place and pose before the
image is recorded.
To help you gauge the timing of the image capture, a tiny lamp on the
front of the camera, just beneath the Mode dial, begins to blink as soon
as you press the shutter button. (The lamp is officially known as the
Red-eye Reduction/Self-Timer lamp.) Additionally, the camera emits a
series of beeps, assuming that you didn’t disable its voice, a setting I
cover in Chapter 1. When the beeps speed up and the light becomes a
solid beam instead of blinking, the image capture is imminent.
I also often use the self-timer function when I want to avoid any possibil-
ity of camera shake. The mere motion of pressing the shutter button can
cause slight camera movement, which can blur an image. So I put the
camera on a tripod and then activate the self-timer function. This enables
“hands-free” — and therefore motion-free — picture-taking.
As another way to enable hands-free shooting, you can purchase the
optional, wireless remote-control unit sold by Canon. Choose the Self-
Timer/Remote Control mode to use that gadget to trigger the shutter
release button.
To select a Drive mode, press the Self-Timer button, found near the top right
corner of your camera monitor and shown in the margin here. You then see 
a screen similar to the one in Figure 2-12. However, you see all three Drive
mode options only in the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP).
In the fully automatic modes, you see only the default Drive mode option plus
the Self-Timer/Remote Control option.

Either way, press the right or left
cross key to highlight your Drive
mode of choice. Then press the Set
button to select it.
Your selected Drive mode remains in
force until you change it. And the
selected setting applies to all expo-
sure modes that offer that particular
Drive mode. For example, if you turn
on self-timer shooting while the
Mode dial is set to Portrait, the set-
ting carries over if you change the
dial to the Landscape mode. And if
you choose the Continuous mode
while working in Manual exposure
mode, it applies also to all the other advanced exposure modes as well as
to Sports and Portrait modes. However, the Drive mode changes to Single if
you switch to any other fully automatic exposure mode except Portrait —
because those other modes offer only Single and Self-Timer/Remote Control
as the Drive mode options.

A
lmost every review of the Rebel XTi/400D contains glowing reports
about the camera’s top-notch picture quality. As you’ve no doubt dis-
covered for yourself, those claims are true, too: This baby can create large,
beautiful images.
Getting the maximum output from your camera, however,
depends on choosing the right capture settings. Chief
among them, and the topic of this chapter, is the appro-
priately named Quality setting. Found on Shooting
Menu 1, this critical control determines two impor-
tant aspects of your pictures: resolution, or pixel
count; and file format, which refers to the type 
of computer file the camera uses to store your 
picture data.
Resolution and file format work together to deter-
mine the quality of your photos, so selecting from the
eight Quality settings on your camera is an important
decision. Why not just dial in the setting that produces
the maximum quality level and be done with it, you ask?
Well, that’s the right choice for some photographers. But
because choosing that maximum setting has some disadvantages, 
you may find that stepping down a notch or two on the quality scale is a
better option every now and then.

54
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To help you figure out which Quality setting meets your needs, this chapter
explains exactly how resolution and file format affect your pictures. Just in
case you’re having quality problems related to other issues, though, the first
section of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect diagnosis guide.
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition,
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image,
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show
five common digital-image defects.
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lense/sensor dirt

Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only two are affected
by the Quality setting on Shooting Menu 1. So if you aren’t happy with your
image quality, first compare your photos to those in the figure to properly
diagnose the problem. Then try these remedies:
 Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored tiles
used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved and diago-
nal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolution, which
you do via the Quality control. See the upcoming section, “Considering
Resolution: Large, Medium, or Small?” for details.
 JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects that
mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in the
JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to 
as JPEG artifacts. This defect is also related to the Quality setting; see
“Understanding File Type (JPEG or Raw)” to find out more.
 Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise is most often related to a very
long exposure time (that is, a very slow shutter speed) or to an exposure
control called ISO, which you can explore in Chapter 5. To adjust shutter
speed or ISO, you must switch to one of the advanced exposure modes
(P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP).
 Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s white bal-
ance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues. Note,
though, that you also must use an advanced exposure mode to adjust
white balance.
 Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind of
defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your lens
doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way onto the
camera’s image sensor. See the sidebar “Maintaining a pristine view,”
elsewhere in this chapter, for information on safe lens and sensor 
cleaning. 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in your
photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. Some defects, espe-
cially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appearance until you see
them at a magnified view.
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a pho-
tograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.
55
Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

56
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your Canon is
suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can pro-
duce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following the
guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, you
can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.
Decoding the Quality Options
As I mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the Quality control deter-
mines both the image resolution and file format of the pictures you shoot. To
access the control, press the Menu button and then display Shooting Menu 1,
shown on the left in Figure 3-2. Highlight Quality and press the Set button to
display the screen you see on the right in the figure.
Figure 3-2: You set resolution and file format together via the Quality menu.
If you’re new to digital photography, the Quality settings won’t make much
sense to you until you read the rest of this chapter, which explains format
and resolution in detail. But even if you are schooled in those topics, you 
may need some help deciphering the way that the settings are represented
on your camera. As you can see from the right side of Figure 3-2, the options
are presented in rather cryptic fashion, so here’s your decoder ring:
 The first three rows of settings produce files in the JPEG file format.
 The little arc-like icons represent the level of JPEG compression, which
affects picture quality and file size. You get two JPEG options, which
carry the labels Fine and Normal. The Fine setting is represented by the
smooth arcs you see in the left column of options. The Normal setting is
represented by the stairstepped icon, shown in the right column. Check
out the section “JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard” for details on
this issue.

 Within the JPEG category, you can choose from three resolution settings,
represented by L, M, and S (large, medium, and small). See the next sec-
tion for information that will help you select the right resolution.
 The Quality settings on the fourth row, which enable you to capture
images in the Raw file format, appear only if you set the camera Mode
dial to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP). All
Raw files are created at the Large resolution setting, giving you the maxi-
mum pixel count. One of the two Raw settings also records a JPEG Fine
version of the image, also at the maximum resolution. The section “Raw
(CR2): The purist’s choice” explains the benefits and downsides to using
the Raw format.
To select a Quality option, just
highlight it and press the Set
button. The selected setting then
appears next to the Quality item
in Shooting Menu 1 and also in 
the lower-left corner of the
Camera Settings display, as 
shown in Figure 3-3.
Note that changing the Quality
setting also changes the number
of pictures that you can store on
your memory card. That number
appears in the lower-right corner
of the display, as labeled in 
Figure 3-3. See the upcoming side-
bar “How many pictures fit on my
memory card?” for details on this
issue.
So, which Quality option is best? The answer depends on several factors,
including how you plan to use your pictures and how much time you care to
spend in the digital darkroom, processing your images on your computer.
The rest of this chapter explains these and other issues related to the Quality
settings. 
Considering Resolution: Large, 
Medium, or Small?
To decide upon a Quality setting, the first decision you need to make is how
many pixels you want your image to contain. Pixels are the little square tiles
from which all digital images are made; the word pixel is short for picture ele-
ment. You can see some pixels close up in the right image in Figure 3-4, which
shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area of the left image.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 3-4: Pixels are the building blocks of digital photos.
The number of pixels in an image is referred to as resolution. Your Canon
offers you three resolution levels, which are assigned the generic labels
Large, Medium, and Small and are represented on the list of Quality settings
by the initials L, M, and S. Table 3-1 shows you the pixel count that results
from each option. (If you select Raw as your Quality setting, images are
always captured at the Large resolution value.)
Table 3-1

M
Medium
2816 x 1880 (5.3 MP)
S
Small
1936 x 1288 (2.5 MP)
In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents the
image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and the
number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the total resolu-
tion, which you get by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel values.
This number is usually stated in megapixels, abbreviated MP for short. One
megapixel equals 1 million pixels. (I rounded off the megapixel values in the
table.)

To figure out how many pixels are enough, you need to understand how reso-
lution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sections explain
these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids.
Pixels and print quality
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels,
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the
right example in Figure 3-4.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to
300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8-by-10-inch
print at 200 ppi, for example, you need 1600 horizontal pixels and 2000 verti-
cal pixels.
Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes at
200 ppi and 300 ppi. But again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. (And
note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of printer
resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay down per
inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce one pixel.)
Table 3-2
Pixel Requirements for Traditional Print Sizes

2200 x 2800
3300 x 4200
Even though many photo-editing programs enable you to add pixels to an
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with,
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images
that illustrate this issue.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Pixels and screen display size
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, television,
or other screen device as it does printed photos. What resolution does do is
determine the size at which the image appears.
This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photography,
so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you need way
fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. For example,
Figure 3-5 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an e-mail message.
Figure 3-5: A 450-x-300-pixel image is plenty large for sharing via e-mail.
For e-mail images, I usually stick with a maximum horizontal pixel count of
450 and a maximum vertical size of 400 pixels, depending on whether the pic-
ture is oriented horizontally, as in the figure, or vertically. If your image is
much larger, the recipient can’t view the entire picture without scrolling the
display.
In short, even if you use one of the Small Quality settings on your Canon, which
produce images that contain 1936 x 1288 pixels, you’ll have more than enough
pixels for most onscreen uses. The only exception might be an image that you
want to display via a digital projector that has a very large screen resolution.
Again, Chapter 9 details this issue and also shows you how to prepare your 
pictures for online sharing.

Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.
Large files present several problems:
 You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on the
memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can
hamper fast-action shooting.
 When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and
download.
 When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer
needs more resources and time to process large files.
To sum up, the tradeoff for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But
note that file format, which is the other half of the Quality equation on your
Canon, also affects file size. See the section “Understanding File Type (JPEG
or Raw)” for more on that topic. The upcoming sidebar “How many pictures
fit on my memory card?” provides details on the file-storage issue.
Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your
photos and share them online? 
Personally, I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the follow-
ing recommendations about whether to choose Large, Medium, or Small
when you select a Quality setting:
 Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create a
low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online.
Chapter 9 shows you how.
Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print.
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the
print quality of a low-resolution image.
 For everyday snapshots, the Medium setting (5.3 MP) is probably suffi-
cient. I find that 10 MP, which is what you get from the Large setting, to
be overkill for most casual snapshots, which means that you’re creating
huge files for no good reason. So I stick with Medium unless I’m shooting
critical images.
61
Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Jump up to Large (10 MP) if you plan to crop your photos or make
huge prints. Always use the maximum resolution if you think you may
want to crop your photo and enlarge the remaining image. For example,
when I shot the left photo in Figure 3-6, I wanted to fill the frame with the
butterfly, but I couldn’t do so without getting so close that I risked scar-
ing it away. So I kept my distance and took the picture at the Large set-
ting, which enabled me to crop the photo and still have enough pixels
left to produce a great print, as you see in the right image.
 Reduce resolution if shooting speed is paramount. If you’re shooting
action and the shot-to-shot capture time is slower than you’d like — that
is, the camera takes too long after you take one shot before it lets you
take another — dialing down the resolution may help. Lower resolution
produces smaller files, and the smaller the file, the less time the camera
needs to record the image to your memory card. Also see Chapter 7 for
other tips on action photography.
Figure 3-6: Capture images that you plan to crop and enlarge at the highest possible resolution (Large).
Understanding File Type (JPEG or Raw)
In addition to establishing the resolution of your photos, the Quality setting
determines the file format. The file format simply refers to the type of image
file that the camera produces.
Your Canon offers two file formats, JPEG and Raw, with a couple variations of
each. The next sections explain the pros and cons of each setting.

Don’t confuse file format with the Format option on Setup Menu 1. That
option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for details.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
How many pictures fit on my memory card?
That question is one of the first asked by new
camera owners — and it’s an important one
because you don’t want to run out of space on
your memory card just as the perfect photo-
graphic subject presents itself.
As explained in the discussions in this chapter,
image resolution (pixel count) and file format
(JPEG or Raw) together determine the size of the
picture file which, in turn, determines how many
photos fit in a given amount of camera memory.
The table below shows you the approximate size
of the files, in megabytes (MB) that are gener-
ated at each of the possible resolution/format
combinations on your Rebel XTi/400D. Following
that number, you see approximately how many
pictures you can store at the setting on a 1GB
(gigabyte) memory card. If you have a 2GB card,
double the picture counts; for a 526MB
(megabyte) card, expect to fit half the number of
pictures.

JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is the default setting on your Canon, as it is
for most digital cameras. JPEG is popular for two main reasons:
 Web compatibility: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display
JPEG files, so you can share them online immediately after you shoot
them.
 Small files: JPEG files are smaller than those produced by the other
common format offered by today’s digital cameras, known as Camera
Raw, or just Raw. And smaller files means that your pictures consume
less room on your camera memory card and in your computer’s storage
tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates
smaller files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws
away some image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see
in the JPEG Artifacts example in Figure 3-1, near the start of this chapter.
On your camera, the amount of compression that is applied depends on
whether you choose a Quality setting that carries the label Fine or Normal.
The difference between the two breaks down as follows:
 Fine: At this setting, represented by the symbol you see in the margin
here, the compression ratio is 4:1 — that is, the file is four times smaller
than it would otherwise be. In plain English, that means that very little
compression is applied, so you shouldn’t see many compression arti-
facts, if any.
 Normal: Switch to Norm (for Normal), and the compression ratio rises
to 9:1. The chance of seeing some artifacting increases as well. Notice
the jaggedy-ness of the Normal icon, shown in the margin here? That’s
your reminder that all may not be “smooth” sailing when you choose a
Normal setting.
For comparison, Figures 3-7 and 3-8 show you the same subject shot at the
Large/Fine and Large/Normal settings, along with the respective file sizes that
each option produces. (I captured each image at the same resolution so that
file type is the only variable.)
When you view the left examples in the comparison figures, you may not see
much difference between the images, although the type on the lighter cases
looks a little sharper in the Large/Fine example. For most printed photos, in
fact, compression defects aren’t terribly distinct when the print size is small.
But when you enlarge your photos, as I did for the right examples in the 

figures, the exact nature of the quality loss that occurs with JPEG compres-
sion become clearer.
Figure 3-7: The Fine setting produces very good image quality and reasonable file sizes.
Figure 3-8: Enlarging an image captured at the Normal setting reveals some quality loss.
Know, too, that compression artifacts usually are significantly easier to spot
when you view digital images on a computer monitor. (The print process
itself softens some of the compression defects.) Artifacting is also usually
more visible in areas of flat color than it is in detailed or textured areas.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

66
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
For my money, the file size benefit you gain when going from Fine to Normal
isn’t worth the risk of artifacts, especially with the price of camera memory
cards getting lower every day. And of all the defects that you can correct in a
photo editor, artifacting is perhaps the hardest to accomplish. So if I shoot in
the JPEG format, I stick with Fine.
I suggest that you do your own test shots, however, carefully inspect the
results in your photo editor, and make your own judgment about what level
of artifacting you can accept. Again, artifacting is often much easier to spot
when you view images onscreen than I can reproduce here in print.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change
the file type to Raw, explained next.
Raw (CR2): The purist’s choice
The other picture-file type that you can create on your Canon is called
Camera Raw, or just Raw (as in uncooked) for short.
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of Raw files; Canon’s are called CR2 files.
If you use a Windows computer, you see that three-letter designation at the
end of your picture filenames.
Raw is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers, for two 
reasons:
 Greater creative control: With JPEG, internal camera software tweaks
your images, making adjustments to color, exposure, and sharpness as
needed to produce the results that Canon believes its customers prefer.
With Raw, the camera simply records the original, unprocessed image
data. The photographer then copies the image file to the computer and
uses special software known as a raw converter to produce the actual
image, making decisions about color, exposure, and so on at that point.
The upshot is that “shooting Raw” enables you, not the camera, to have
the final say on the visual characteristics of your image.
 Best picture quality: Because Raw doesn’t apply the destructive com-
pression associated with JPEG, you don’t run the risk of the artifacting
that can occur with JPEG.
But of course, as with most things in life, Raw isn’t without its disadvantages.
To wit:
 You can’t do anything with your pictures until you process them with
a Raw converter. You can’t share them online, print them, put them in a
document — nada. So when you shoot Raw, you add to the time you

must spend in front of the computer instead of behind the camera lens.
Chapter 8 shows you how to process your Raw files using the converter
found in the Canon software that was included in your camera box.
Note, too, that technology that will enable retail printers to print Raw
files is on the horizon, so you may not have to process the images to get
prints made in the near future. Of course, that means that the printer
would do the processing, making all those color, exposure, and other
judgments for you, but only for the prints you order. You could still
process the images for your own use on your computer. 
 Raw files are larger than JPEGs. The type of file compression that Raw
applies doesn’t degrade image quality, but the tradeoff is larger files. In
addition, Raw files are always captured at the maximum resolution avail-
able on your camera, even if you don’t really need all those pixels. For
both reasons, Raw files are significantly larger than JPEGs, so they take
up more room on your memory card and on your computer’s hard drive
or other picture-storage device.
Are the disadvantages worth the gain? Only you can decide. But before you
make up your mind, compare the Large/Fine JPEG image in Figure 3-7 with its
Raw counterpart, shown in Figure 3-9. You may be able to detect some subtle
quality differences in the enlarged view, but most people would be hard
pressed to distinguish between the two otherwise. And JPEG certainly wins
out in terms of convenience, time savings, and smaller file size. (Note that
during the Raw conversion process, I tried to use settings that kept the Raw
image as close as possible to its JPEG cousin in all aspects but quality. But
any variations in exposure, color, and contrast are a result of the conversion
process, not of the format per se.)
Figure 3-9: The difference between Raw and Large/Fine images typically is noticeable only when images are
greatly enlarged.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

68
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
That said, I do shoot in the Raw format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting
because doing so gives you more control over the final image exposure. For
example, if you use a capable Raw converter, you can specify how bright you
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer
your deepest shadows. With JPEG, the camera makes those decisions, which
can potentially limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure in your
photo editor later.
I also go Raw if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But
keep in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and I
don’t really have much else to do with my time than process scads of Raw
images. Oh, and I’m a bit of a perfectionist, too. (Although I’m more bothered
by imperfections than I am motivated to remove them. A lazy perfectionist, if
you will.)
If you do decide to try Raw shooting, you can select from the following two
Quality options:
 RAW: This setting produces a single Raw file at the maximum resolution
(10 megapixels).
 RAW+Large/Fine: This setting produces two files: the standard Raw file
plus a JPEG file captured at the Large/Fine setting. At first glance, this
option sounds great: You can share the JPEG online or get prints made
and then process your Raw files when you have time.
The problem is that, like the Raw file, the JPEG image is captured at the
maximum pixel count — which is too large for onscreen viewing. That
means that you have to edit the JPEG file anyway to trim down the pixel
count before online sharing, although you can produce great prints right
away. In addition, creating two files for every image eats up substantially
more memory card space. I leave it up to you to decide whether the
pluses are worth the minuses.
My take: Choose Fine or Raw
At this point, you may be finding all this technical goop a bit much — I recog-
nize that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things for you.
Until you have time or energy to completely digest all the ramifications of
JPEG versus Raw, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the matter:
 If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and
interest to do the Raw conversion process, shoot Raw. See Chapter 8 
for more information the conversion process.
 If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick with
one of the Fine settings (Large/Fine, Medium/Fine, or Small/Fine). 

 Stay away from JPEG Normal. The tradeoff for smaller files isn’t, in my
opinion, worth the risk of compression artifacts. As with my recommen-
dations on resolution, this fits the “better safe than sorry” formula: You
never know when you may capture a spectacular, enlargement-worthy
subject, and it would be a shame to have the photo spoiled by compres-
sion defects.
 Finally, remember that the format and resolution together determine the
ultimate picture quality. So be sure that you select the Quality setting that
offers both the appropriate number of pixels and format for how you plan
to use your image. If you capture an image at the Small/Normal setting, for
example, and then print the photo at a large size, the combination of a
lower pixel count and a higher level of JPEG compression may produce
disappointing picture quality.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
Maintaining a pristine view
Often lost in discussions of digital photo
defects — compression artifacts, pixelation,
and the like — is the impact of plain-old dust
and dirt on picture quality. But no matter what
camera settings you use, you aren’t going to
achieve great picture quality with a dirty lens.
So make it a practice to clean your lens on a
regular basis, using one of the specialized
cloths and cleaning solutions made expressly
for that purpose.
If you continue to notice random blobs or hair-
like defects in your images (refer to the last
example in Figure 3-1), you probably have a dirty
image sensor. That’s the part of your camera
that does the actual image capture — the digi-
tal equivalent of a film negative, if you will.
Especially if you frequently change lenses in 
a dirty environment, regular sensor cleaning
may be necessary. You can do this job yourself,
but . . . I don’t recommend it. Image sensors are
pretty delicate beings, and you can easily
damage it or other parts of your camera if you
aren’t careful. Instead, find a local camera store
that offers this service. In my area (central
Indiana), sensor cleaning costs about $30 to
$50. If you bought your camera at a traditional
camera store, the store may even provide free
sensor cleaning as a way to keep your business.
One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean
never — try to clean any part of your camera
using a can of compressed air. Doing so can not
only damage the interior of your camera, blow-
ing dust or dirt into areas where it can’t be
removed, but also crack the external monitor.

ithout question, my favorite thing about digital photography is being
able to view my pictures on the camera monitor the instant after I
shoot them. No more guessing whether I captured the image I wanted or need
to try again; no more wasting money on developing and printing pictures that
stink. In fact, this feature alone was reason enough for me to turn my back
forever on my closetful of film photography hardware and all the
unexposed film remaining from my predigital days.
But simply seeing your pictures is just the start of the
things you can do when you switch your camera to play-
back mode. You also can review many of the camera
settings you used to take the picture, display graph-
ics that alert you to serious exposure problems,
delete crummy photos, and add file markers that
protect the picture from accidental erasure. This
chapter tells you how to use all these playback fea-
tures and more.
After you explore these playback functions, be sure to
also visit Chapter 9, which covers some additional ways
to view your images, including how to create in-camera
slide shows and display your photos on a television screen.

Adjusting the Instant Review Time
After you take a picture, it automatically appears briefly on the camera moni-
tor. By default, the instant-review period lasts just two seconds. But you can
customize this behavior via the Review Time option on the Playback menu,
as shown in Figure 4-1.
Your choices are as follows:
 Select one of three specific review
periods: 2, 4, or 8 seconds.
 Select Off to disable the automatic
instant review altogether.
Why would you do so? Because
you can’t take any new pictures
until the review period ends, which
can hamper your ability to capture
action. (You can still view your pic-
tures by pressing the Playback
button. See the next section for
details.)
 Select Hold to display the current image indefinitely — or, at least until
the camera automatically shuts itself off to save power or you put your
eye up to the viewfinder, which automatically turns off the monitor. (See
the Chapter 1 section about Setup Menu 1 to find out about the auto-
shutdown and auto-display-off features.)
Viewing Images in Playback Mode
To switch your camera to playback mode and view the images currently on
your memory card, take these steps:
1. Press the Playback button, labeled in Figure 4-2 and shown in the
margin here.
The monitor displays the last picture you took. You may see just the
image itself or the image plus some shooting data.
To find out how to interpret the picture data and specify what data you
want to see, see the upcoming section “Viewing Picture Data.” If you’re
curious now, though, or if the picture data is hampering your ability to
see the picture itself, press the DISP button to cycle through the three
data-display formats. (Figure 4-2 shows the image in the one mode that
does not include any shooting data.)
Figure 4-1: You can extend or disable auto-
matic picture review.

Figure 4-2: Press the Playback button to inspect your photos.
2. Press the right or left cross key to scroll through your pictures.
• Press the right cross key to view images starting with the oldest
one on the card.
• Press the left cross key to view images in reverse order, starting
with the most current picture.
Just keep pressing either key to browse through all of your images. Or, 
if you prefer, you also can rotate the Main dial to scroll through your
photos.
3. To return to picture-taking mode, press the Playback button or press
the shutter button halfway.
The camera exits playback mode, and the Camera Settings display
appears on the monitor. Chapter 1 introduces you to that display.
These steps assume that the camera is currently set to display a single photo
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-2. You can also display multiple images at a
time; the next section tells all.

Jumping through images
If your memory card contains scads of images, here’s a trick you’ll love: By
using the Jump button, you can leapfrog through them instead of pressing
the right or left cross key a bazillion times to get to the picture you want to
see. You also can search for the last image shot on a specific date.
This feature works like so:
1. Press the Playback
button to put the
camera into play-
back mode.
2. Press the Jump
button.
As soon as you press
the button, the jump
bar appears at the
bottom of the moni-
tor, as shown in
Figure 4-3.
3. Select a Jump mode
by pressing the up 
or down cross key.
The current Jump
mode appears on the jump bar. You have three Jump mode options:
• Jump 10 Images: Select this option to advance 10 images at a time.
• Jump 100 Images: Select this option to advance 100 images at a time.
• Jump Shot Date: This option enables you to jump to the last image
that you shot on the same day as the currently displayed image.
For example, if you shot the current photo on May 1, you can jump
to the last photo you shot on that day.
4. Press the right or left cross key to browse images using the selected
Jump mode.
How many images you advance with each press of a cross key depends
upon the Jump mode you selected. Again, you can also rotate the Main
dial to browse images instead of pressing the cross keys if you like that
method better.
5. To exit Jump mode, press the Jump button again.
You can use this method of browsing your images only in regular, single-image
playback mode. The Jump button performs a different function in index display
mode, in which you view nine image thumbnails at a time. The next section
explains this viewing mode.
Figure 4-3: The current Jump mode appears on the jump bar.

Viewing multiple images at a time
If you want to quickly review and compare several photos, you can set the
camera to index display and view thumbnails of nine images at a time, as
shown in Figure 4-4. Just press the AE Lock button, found on the upper-right
corner of the camera back and shown in the margin here.
Note the little blue checkerboard and magnifying glass icons next to the
button — they’re reminders of the function the button serves in playback
mode. The checkerboard indicates the index function, and the minus sign 
in the magnifying glass tells you that pressing the button reduces the size of
the image display. (Remember, the black labels near these buttons indicate a
function related to picture-taking.)
Remember these factoids about navigating and viewing your photo collection
in index display mode: 
 The green border indicates the currently selected image. For example,
in Figure 4-4, the top-right photo is selected.
 Press the AF Point Selection button to view the selected image at full
size. This button lives right next door to the AE Lock button. It, too, has
a blue magnifying glass icon, this time with a plus sign in the center to
indicate that pressing the button enlarges the view. To return to index
display mode, press the AE Lock button again.
 Use the cross keys or Main dial to select a different image. Press the
up cross key to shift the selection box up, the right cross key to move it
right, and so on.
Figure 4-4: You can view nine thumbnails at once.

 Press the Jump button to switch to “fast-forward” mode. When you
press the button, all nine thumbnails become selected. Now you can
press the right cross key or rotate the Main dial to the right to advance
to the next nine images. Press the left cross key or rotate the Main dial
to the left to view the previous nine images. To exit this mode, press
Jump again.
Rotating vertical pictures
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — that
is, whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally oriented
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically oriented photo.
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file. Then when you view the
picture, either during the instant-review period or after you set the camera 
to playback mode, the camera reads the data and automatically rotates the
image so that it appears in the upright position in the monitor, as shown on
the left in Figure 4-5. The image is also rotated automatically when you view 
it in the photo software that shipped with your camera.
Figure 4-5: You can display vertically oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or 
sideways (right).
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically 
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented
pictures.
By default, automatic picture rotation is enabled for you. If for some reason
you want to turn it off, you can do so through the Auto Rotate option on Setup
Menu 1, shown in Figure 4-6. You also can specify that you want the picture to
be rotated just on your computer monitor by choosing the second of the two
On settings (the one that doesn’t sport the little camera icon).
If you do turn off automatic rotation, you can rotate one or more images on
your memory card by taking these steps:

1. Display the Playback menu and
highlight Rotate, as shown in 
Figure 4-7.
2. Press the Set button.
An image appears on the monitor.
3. Navigate to the photo that you
want to rotate.
Just press the right and left cross
keys or rotate the Main dial to 
do so.
4. Press Set to rotate the image 90
degrees clockwise.
Each time you press Set, you
rotate the image another 90
degrees.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to rotate
additional photos.
6. Press Menu to exit Rotate mode
and return to the Playback
menu.
You can also rotate images in index 
display mode; just use the cross keys
or Main dial to select and rotate each
photo as desired. Remember, the green
box indicates the selected photo.
Zooming in for a closer view
By pressing the AF Point Selection button, posing here in the margin, you can
more closely inspect a portion of the onscreen image. This feature comes in
especially handy for checking small details, such as whether anyone’s eyes
are closed in a group portrait, for example, and for determining whether the
subject of your picture is sharply focused.
Here’s the scoop on this feature:
 Zoom in. You can enlarge an image display to a maximum of 10 times its
original size. Just keep pressing the AF Point Selection button until you
reach the magnification you want.

 View another part of the picture. Whenever the image is magnified, a
little thumbnail representing the entire image appears briefly in the
lower-right corner of the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-8. The white box
indicates the portion of the image that’s currently consuming the rest of
the monitor space.
Use the cross keys to scroll the display to view a different portion of the
image. Press the up cross key to scroll up, the left cross key to scroll left,
and so on.
 View more images at the same magnification. Here’s an especially neat
trick: While the display is zoomed, you can rotate the Main dial to dis-
play the same area of the next photo at the same magnification. So, for
example, if you shot that group portrait several times, you can easily
check each one for shut-eye problems.
You also even maintain the same magnification while jumping ahead 10
images at a time. To do so, press the Jump button and then press the
right or left cross key or rotate the Main dial. Press Jump again to go
back to regular, one-by-one browsing mode.
 View magnified images in index display mode. You can get close-up
views of the currently selected thumbnail (the one surrounded by the
green border) by pressing the AF Point Selection button. But you must
press the button twice: Press once to view the selected image at full
frame view; then press again to switch to zoom-in mode.
 Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the AE Lock
button. Continue holding the button down until you reach the magnifica-
tion you want.
Figure 4-8: Press the cross keys to scroll the display of the 
magnified image.
Magnified image area

 Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the AE Lock button
until you’re all the way zoomed out. Instead, just press the Playback
button, which quickly returns you to the standard view.
For one more magnification trick, available only when you shoot in the
advanced exposure modes, see Chapter 11. (Hint: By using a Custom Function
setting, you can magnify images even during the instant review period.)
Viewing Picture Data
In playback mode, you can choose from three information-display styles,
which determine whether any shooting data appears along with the image 
in the monitor. Your options are as follows:
 Image Only: You see just the image in the monitor, without shooting data.
 Basic Information: In this mode, the picture folder number and the last
four digits of the filename appear in the upper-right corner of the frame,
as shown in Figure 4-9. In the lower-left corner, you see the shutter
speed and aperture setting (f-stop) used to record the image, along with

report of the camera settings that were in force when you took the pic-
ture. The next two sections help you sort out all the bits and pieces of
onscreen data.

To cycle through the display styles, just press the DISP button. In single-
image playback mode, you can access all three display styles. When you
switch to index mode (viewing nine thumbnails at a time) or magnify an
image, you can choose from just the first two display modes (no information
or basic information).
You can view even more shooting data, officially referred to as metadata, when
you open your images in your photo software. Chapter 8 shows you how.
Decoding Shooting Information data
In the Shooting Information display mode, the camera presents a thumbnail
of your image along with scads of shooting data, as shown in Figure 4-10.
(Remember: Just press the DISP button to cycle from this mode to view only
basic information or no information with your image.)
Figure 4-10: You can view more data in Shooting Information playback mode.
Here’s a brief description of what you can glean from the different areas of
the screen:
 Basic Information data: The file number, folder number, aperture, shut-
ter speed, frame number, and total number of images appear in the same
locations as in Basic Information mode.
Date/time
ISO
Exposure/flash compensation
Histogram
Color Space
White Balance
Metering mode
Exposure mode
File size
Quality

 Histogram: That little graph to the right of the image thumbnail is the
histogram, which is an exposure evaluation tool. Check out the next sec-
tions for details on interpreting the histogram and changing the his-
togram style.
 Blinking highlights: Are any areas of the image thumbnail blinking? The
blinking spots indicate areas that are completely white — known in the
photography business as blown highlights. Depending on where in the
image those areas occur, you may or may not have an exposure prob-
lem. For example, if someone’s face contains the blinking spots, that
someone is overexposed, and you should take steps to correct the 
problem. But if the blinking occurs in, say, a bright window behind the
subject, and the subject itself looks fine, you may choose to just ignore
the alert. 
 Date and Time: Just below the image thumbnail, you see the date and
time that you took the picture. Of course, the accuracy of this data
depends on whether you set the camera’s date and time values cor-
rectly, which you do via Setup Menu 1. Chapter 1 has details.
 Exposure and Flash Compensation values: To the right of the aperture
readout, you see the exposure compensation and flash compensation
settings that were used to take the picture. Chapter 5 explains these fea-
tures, which are available only in the advanced exposure modes. (The
flash compensation data does not appear if you didn’t use flash when
taking the picture, however.)
 Metering mode: This icon represents the exposure metering mode,
another advanced exposure control that you can explore in Chapter 5.
 Exposure mode: Just to the right of the metering mode icon, you see a
symbol or letter that indicates which of the camera’s exposure modes
you used (Full Auto, Portrait, Tv, and so on). Chapter 2 explains the fully
automatic modes; Chapter 5 introduces you to the advanced modes.
 White Balance setting: Just above the metering mode and exposure
mode data, you see an icon representing the White Balance setting and
any custom adjustment you made to that setting. Chapter 6 has details
on white balance. 
 Color Space: Your camera can capture images in two color spaces, sRGB
and Adobe RGB. A color space is just a definition of the spectrum of
colors that an image can contain. The color space that you used for the
current picture appears just beneath the histogram in the display. You
can change color spaces only in advanced exposure modes; Chapter 6
has details about how and why to do so.
 Quality and File Size: These two bits of information appear on the
bottom row of the display. For details on the Quality setting and how 
it affects file size and picture quality, see Chapter 3.
 ISO: This setting controls your camera’s sensitivity to light. You can
adjust ISO only in the advanced exposure modes; Chapter 5 has the
scoop.

Although not shown in Figure 4-10, the following two pieces of data may also
show up:
 Image Protect: Using a feature described later in this chapter, you can
“lock” an image to prevent it from being accidentally deleted. If you do
so, a little key icon appears to the left of the Quality icon, on the bottom
row of the display.
 B/W: If you capture an image using the Monochrome Picture Style, the
letters B/W appear next to the metering mode icon. You can capture
monochrome images only in the advanced exposure modes; Chapter 6
has details.
Interpreting the histogram
One of the most difficult photo problems to correct in a photo-editing pro-
gram is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights in
others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include a
variety of light shades are instead totally white. For example, in a cloud
image, pixels that should be light to very light gray become white due to
overexposure, resulting in a loss of detail in those clouds.
In Shooting Information display mode, areas that fall into this category blink
in the image thumbnail. This warning is a great feature because simply view-
ing the image isn’t always a reliable way to gauge exposure; the relative
brightness of the monitor and the ambient light in which you view it affect
the appearance of the image onscreen. Again, though, blinking highlights
doesn’t necessarily indicate that your exposure is off. If you have a dark sub-
ject against a very bright background, for example, you may not be able to
properly expose the subject without creating at least some blown highlights
in the background. 
For a detailed analysis of the image
exposure, check the histogram, the
graph that appears to the right of the
image thumbnail in Shooting Info dis-
play mode. By default, the histogram
is set to Brightness Display mode and
appears similar to what you see in
Figure 4-11. In this mode, the his-
togram indicates the distributions 
of shadows, highlights, and midtones
(areas of medium brightness) in your
image. Photographers use the term
tonal range to describe this aspect of
their pictures.
Shadows
Highlights
Figure 4-11: The standard histogram indicates
the tonal range of your image.

The horizontal axis of the graph represents the possible picture brightness
values, from the darkest shadows on the left to the brightest highlights on
the right. And the vertical axis shows you how many pixels fall at a particular
brightness value. A spike indicates a heavy concentration of pixels.
For example, in Figure 4-11, which shows the histogram for the wagon wheel
image shown in Figure 4-10, the histogram shows that the picture doesn’t
contain a lot of highlight pixels or any pixels at the darkest end of the spec-
trum. To put it in photography terms, the image is a little lacking in contrast —
most of the image is relatively similar in brightness, without strong highlights
or shadows.
As with the highlight alerts, the Brightness Display mode of the histogram is
provided to give you a way to gauge exposure that’s a little more reliable than
simply eyeballing the image on the monitor. Remember, if you adjust the
brightness of the monitor or the ambient light affects the display brightness,
you may not get the real story on exposure.
For information about the other histogram mode, check out the next section.
For help with adjusting exposure, see Chapter 5.
Viewing the RGB histogram
By visiting the Playback menu and
selecting the Histogram option, as
shown in Figure 4-12, you can change
the histogram from its default mode,
Brightness Display, to RGB Display. In
this mode, the histogram appears simi-
lar to the one you see in Figure 4-13.
To make sense of the RGB histogram,
you first need to know that digital
images are called RGB images because
they are created out of three primary
colors of light: red, green, and blue.
The RGB histogram shows you the
brightness values for each of those 
primary colors.
What’s the point? Well, by checking the brightness levels of the individual
color components, sometimes referred to as color channels, you can assess
the picture’s color saturation levels. If most of the image pixels are clustered
toward the right end of the histogram, colors may be oversaturated, which
destroys detail. On the flip side, a heavy concentration of pixels at the left
end of the histogram indicates an image that may be undersaturated.

Figure 4-12: Change the histogram mode via
the Playback menu.

84
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 4-13: The RGB histogram shows the red, green, and 
blue brightness values.
A savvy RGB histogram reader can also spot color balance issues by looking
at the pixel values. But frankly, color-balance problems are fairly easy to
notice just by looking at the image itself. And understanding how to translate
the histogram data for this purpose requires more knowledge about RGB
color theory than I have room to present in this book.
In fact, unless you are really interested in the subject, I suggest that you leave
the histogram in the Brightness Display mode and leave RGB Display mode
for a day when you’ve mastered all the other controls on your camera. (I do
find, however, that reviewing my pictures in RGB mode seems to impress the
heck out of nosy airplane seatmates, especially those of the engineer and
mathematician variety.)
For more information about manipulating color, see Chapter 6.
Deleting Photos
When you spot a clunker image during your picture review, you can erase it
from your memory card as follows:
1. Select the image that you want to delete.
If you are viewing images in single-frame mode, just display the image on
the monitor. In index display mode, use the cross keys to move the
green selection box over the image thumbnail.
2. Press the Erase button.
It’s the one with the little trash can icon, as shown in the margin here.

Three options — Cancel, Erase,
and All — appear at the bottom 
of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 4-14.
3. Highlight Erase and then press
the Set button.
Your picture is zapped into digital
oblivion.
To erase all pictures on the memory
card, just select All instead of Erase in
Step 3. After you press Set, you see a
confirmation screen asking whether
you really want to delete all your pic-
tures. Select OK and press Set to go ahead and dump the photos. (Note,
though, that pictures that you have protected, a step discussed in the next
section, are left intact.)
You can use the Protect feature to prevent a group of pictures from being
deleted when you choose the Erase All option. First, protect the pictures that
you want to keep. Then press the Erase button and select the All option to
get rid of all the unprotected photos. If you are getting rid of lots of images,
this technique is usually faster than deleting them one by one.
If you accidentally erase a picture, don’t panic — you may be able to restore
it by using data-restoration software. One memory-card manufacturer,
SanDisk, even provides this type of software free on some of its memory
cards. You also can buy stand-alone programs such as MediaRecover ($30,
www.mediarecover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also $30, www.lexar.com).
But in order to have a chance at recovering deleted data, you must not take
any more pictures or perform any other operations on your camera while the
current memory card is in it. If you do, you may overwrite the erased picture
data for good and eliminate the possibility of recovering the image.
Protecting Photos
You can protect pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to delete a 
picture.
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pictures.
See the sidebar elsewhere in this chapter for more about formatting.
The picture protection feature comes in especially handy if you share a
camera with other people. You can protect pictures so that those other
people know that they shouldn’t delete your super-great images to make
85
Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
Figure 4-14: You can erase the current image
or all images.

86
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
room on the memory card for their stupid, badly photographed ones. (This
step isn’t foolproof, though, because anyone can remove the protected status
from an image.)
Perhaps more importantly, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a “read
only” file when you transfer it to a Windows-based computer. Files that have
that read-only status can’t be altered. Again, anyone with some computer
savvy can remove the status in Windows, but this feature can keep casual
users from messing around with your images after you’ve downloaded them
to your system. Of course, you have to know how to remove the read-only
status yourself if you plan on editing your photo in your photo software. (Hint:
In Canon ZoomBrowser EX, the free Windows-based software that ships with
your camera, you can do this by choosing File➪Protect. That command tog-
gles image protection on and off.)
Anyway, protecting a picture is easy. Just take these steps:
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Protect, as shown in 
Figure 4-15.
2. Press Set.
An image appears on the monitor, along with a little key icon in the
upper-left corner, as shown on the right in Figure 4-15.
3. Navigate to the picture that you want to protect.
Just press the right or left cross key or rotate the Main dial to scroll
through your pictures.
Deleting versus formatting: What’s the diff?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the Format com-
mand, which lives on Setup Menu 1 and erases
everything on your memory card. What’s the dif-
ference between erasing photos by formatting
and by using the Erase button and then selecting
the All option? 
Well, in terms of pictures taken with your Canon,
none. But if you happen to have stored other data
on the card, such as, say, a music file or a picture
taken on another type of camera, you need to
format the card to erase everything on it. You
can’t view those files on the monitor, so you can’t
use the Erase button to get rid of them.
One final — and important — note: Although
using the Protect feature (explained elsewhere
in this chapter) prevents the Erase function from
erasing a picture, formatting erases all pictures,
protected or not. Formatting also ensures that the
card is properly prepared to store any new
images you may take.

Figure 4-15: Apply Protect status to prevent accidental erasure of important images.
4. Press Set to lock the picture.
Now a second key icon appears
with the data at the bottom of the
screen, as shown in Figure 4-16.
5. To lock more pictures, repeat
Steps 3 and 4.
6. Press the Menu button to exit 
the protection process.
To remove picture protection, follow
these same steps. When you display
the locked picture, just press Set to
turn the protection off.

Taking Creative
Control

In this part . . .
A
s nice as it is to be able to set your camera to
automatic mode and let it handle most of the
photographic decisions, I encourage you to also
explore the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av,
M, and A-DEP). In these modes, you can make
your own decisions about the exposure, focus,
and color characteristics of your photo, which is
key to capturing an image as you see it in your
mind’s eye. And don’t think that you have to be a
genius or spend years to be successful — adding
just a few simple techniques to your photographic
repertoire can make a huge difference in how
happy you are with the pictures you take. 
The ﬁrst two chapters in this part explain every-
thing you need to know to do just that, providing
some necessary photography fundamentals and
details about using the advanced exposure modes.
Following that, Chapter 7 helps you draw together
all the information presented earlier in the book,
summarizing the best camera settings and other
tactics to use when capturing portraits, action
shots, landscapes, and close-up shots.

y using the fully automatic modes covered in Chapter 2,
you can take great pictures with your Rebel XTi/400D.
But to really exploit your camera’s capabilities — and,
more important, to exploit your creative capabilities —
you need to explore your camera’s five advanced
exposure modes, represented on the Mode dial by
the letters P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. 
This chapter explains everything you need to know
to start taking advantage of these five modes. First,
you get an introduction to the critical exposure con-
trols known as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.
Adjusting these settings enables you to not only fine-
tune image exposure but also affect other aspects of
your image, such as depth of field (the zone of sharp focus)
and motion blur. In addition, this chapter explains other
advanced exposure features, such as exposure compensation and
metering modes, and discusses the flash options available to you in the
advanced exposure modes. 
If you’re worried that this stuff is too complicated for you, by the way, don’t
be. Even in these advanced exposure modes, the camera provides you with
enough feedback that you’re never truly flying without a net. Between the 

92
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
in-camera support and the information in this chapter, you can easily master
aperture, shutter speed, and all the other exposure features — an important
step in making the shift from picture-taker to photographer.
Kicking Your Camera into Advanced Gear
The first step to taking the exposure reins is to set your camera’s Mode dial
to one of the five shooting modes highlighted in Figure 5-1: P, Tv, Av, M, or 
A-DEP. You also need to shoot in one of these modes to use certain other
camera features, such as manual white balancing, a color feature that you can
explore in Chapter 6.
Each of the five modes offers a different level of control over two critical
exposure settings, aperture and shutter speed. Later in this chapter, I explain
these controls fully, but here’s a quick introduction:
 P (programmed auto): In this mode,
the camera selects both the aperture
and shutter speed for you. But you can
choose from different combinations of
the two, which gives you creative flexi-
bility not possible in the fully auto-
matic modes discussed in Chapter 2. 
 Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure): In
this mode, you select a shutter speed,
and the camera chooses the aperture
setting that produces a good exposure.
Why Tv? Well, shutter speed controls
exposure time; Tv stands for time
value. 
 Av (aperture-priority autoexposure):
The opposite of shutter-priority auto-
exposure, this mode asks you to select the aperture setting — thus Av,
for aperture value. The camera then selects the appropriate shutter
speed to properly expose the picture.
 A-DEP (auto depth-of-field): Depth of field refers to the extent to which
objects at a distance from your subject appear sharply focused. One
way to control depth of field is to adjust the aperture setting. In this
exposure mode, the camera assesses the distance between the lens and
major objects in the frame and tries to choose an aperture setting that
keeps all those objects within the zone of sharp focus. Then the camera
sets the shutter speed appropriate for the aperture it selected.
Advanced exposure modes
Figure 5-1: You can control exposure
and other picture properties only in 
P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP modes.

Although this mode is a nice feature for photographers not yet schooled
in manipulating depth of field, it provides the least amount of photo-
graphic control of all the advanced exposure modes because you’re
stuck with whatever aperture and shutter speed the camera selects. In
addition, when you use flash, you lose the automatic depth-of-field fea-
ture, and A-DEP mode works just like P mode — but without the benefit
of being able to select from different combinations of aperture and shut-
ter speed. So after you digest the depth-of-field discussion in Chapter 6, 
I suggest that you practice using Av mode instead, where you can select
the aperture yourself. Keep in mind that your camera offers a depth-of-
field preview feature so that you can see in advance whether the aper-
ture setting is appropriate. Chapter 6 spells out how to use the feature. 
 M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and
aperture. 
To sum up, the first three modes are semi-automatic exposure modes that are
designed to help you get a good exposure while still providing you with some
photographic flexibility. A-DEP mode removes aperture and shutter speed
control from your hands but enables you to adjust other picture settings,
such as white balance. Manual mode puts all exposure control in your hands.
But even in Manual mode, the camera assists you by displaying a meter that
tells you whether your exposure settings are on target.
Again, I realize that the descriptions of these modes won’t make much sense
to you if you aren’t already schooled in the basics of exposure. If you are and
you just want to know the specifics of using these modes on your camera, flip
ahead to the section “Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed,” later in this
chapter. For details about the aforementioned exposure warnings and meter,
see “Monitoring Exposure Settings” instead. Otherwise, the next several sec-
tions provide you with the fundamentals you need to make good use of the
advanced modes.
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken with a film or digital camera, is created by
focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive recording medium. In a
film camera, the film negative serves as that medium; in a digital camera, it’s
the image sensor, which is an array of light-responsive computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are two barriers, known as the aperture and
shutter, which together control how much light makes its way to the sensor.
The actual design and arrangement of the aperture, shutter, and sensor vary
depending on the camera, but Figure 5-2 offers an illustration of the basic
concept.
93
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

94
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The aperture and shutter, along with
a third feature known as ISO, deter-
mine exposure — what most of us
would describe as the picture’s
overall brightness and contrast.
This three-part exposure formula
works as follows:
 Aperture (controls amount 
of light): The aperture is an
adjustable hole in a diaphragm
set just behind the lens. By
changing the size of the aper-
ture, you control the size of the
light beam that can enter the
camera. Aperture settings are
stated as f-stop numbers, or
simply f-stops, and are
expressed with the letter f
followed by a number: f/2, 
f/5.6, f/16, and so on.
The lower the f-stop
number, the larger the
aperture, as illustrated
by Figure 5-3.
The range of possible 
f-stops depends on your
lens and, if you use a
zoom lens, on the zoom
position (focal length)
of the lens. For the kit
lens sold with the Rebel
XTi/D400, you can
select apertures from
f/3.5–f/22 when zoomed
all the way out to the
shortest focal length (18mm). When you zoom in to the maximum focal
length (55mm), the aperture range is f/5.6–f/36. (See Chapter 6 for a dis-
cussion of focal lengths.)
 Shutter speed (controls duration of light): Set behind the aperture, the
shutter works something like, er, the shutters on a window. When you
aren’t taking pictures, the camera’s shutter stays closed, preventing light
from striking the image sensor, just as closed window shutters prevent
sunlight from entering a room. When you press the shutter button, the
shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the aperture to
hit the image sensor.

Figure 5-3: The smaller the f-stop number, the larger the
aperture.

The length of time that the shutter is open is called the shutter speed and
is measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and so
on. Shutter speeds on the Rebel XTi/D400 range from 30 seconds to
1/4000 second when you shoot without flash. Should you want a shutter
speed longer than 30 seconds, manual (M) exposure mode also provides
a feature called bulb exposure. At this setting, the shutter stays open
indefinitely as long as you press the shutter button down.
If you do use a flash, the fastest available shutter speed is 1/200 second;
the slowest ranges from 1/60 second to 30 seconds, depending on the
exposure mode. See the section “Understanding your camera’s approach
to flash,” later in this chapter, for details.
 ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from
film days, when an international standards organization rated each film
stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 800, and so on.
Film or digital, a higher ISO rating means greater light sensitivity, which
means that less light is needed to produce the image, enabling you to
use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both.
On your camera, you can select ISO settings ranging from 100 to 1600,
but only when you shoot in the advanced exposure modes. For the fully
automatic modes, you’re limited to ISO speeds from 100 to 400, and the
camera chooses the setting for you automatically.
Distilled down to its essence, the image-exposure formula is just this simple: 
 Aperture and shutter speed together determine the quantity of light that
strikes the image sensor.
 ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
As illustrated by the images in Figure 5-4, you can create the same exposure
with different combinations of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. And
although the figure shows you only two variations of settings, your choices
are pretty much endless — you’re limited only by the aperture range allowed
by the lens and the shutter speeds and ISO settings offered by the camera. 
95
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

96
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-4: Aperture and shutter speed affect depth of field and motion blur.
But the settings you select impact your image beyond mere exposure, as
follows:
 Aperture affects depth of field. The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects
depth of field, which is the range of sharp focus in your image. I intro-
duce this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a quick recap: With a shallow
depth of field, your subject appears more sharply focused than faraway
objects; with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus zone spreads over a
greater distance.
As you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in photo
lingo — by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth of field.
As an example, notice that the background in the first image in Figure
5-4, which I shot using an aperture setting of f/13, appears noticeably
sharper than in the right example, which was taken at f/5.6. Aperture is
just one contributor to depth of field, however; see Chapter 6 for the
complete story.
f/13, 1/25 second, ISO 200
f/5.6, 1/125 second, ISO 200

 Shutter speed affects motion blur. At a slow shutter speed, moving
objects appear blurry, whereas a fast shutter speed captures motion
cleanly. Compare the fountain water in the photos in Figure 5-4, for
example. At a shutter speed
of 1/125 second, the water
droplets appear much more
sharply focused than at 1/25
second. At the slower shut-
ter speed, the water blurs,
giving it a misty look. How
high a shutter speed you
need to freeze action
depends on the speed of
your subject, of course.
If your picture suffers from
overall image blur like you
see in Figure 5-5, where
even stationary objects
appear out of focus, the
camera itself moved during
the exposure. As you
increase the exposure time
(by selecting a slower shut-
ter speed), you increase the
risk of this problem because
you have to keep the camera
still for a longer period of
time. Most people enter 
the camera-shake zone at
speeds slower than about
1/50 second, although some
people have steadier hands
than others.
My abilities vary depending
on the day and my caffeine
intake; I was able to snap the first example in Figure 5-4 at 1/25 second,
but frankly, that was a lucky accident as I usually can’t handhold at
speeds that slow. At the 1/5 second used in Figure 5-5, camera shake 
was almost inevitable.
To avoid this issue, use a tripod or otherwise steady the camera. And
see Chapter 6 for tips on solving other focus problems and Chapter 7 for
more help with action photography.
 ISO affects image noise. As ISO increases, making the image sensor more
reactive to light, you increase the risk of producing a defect called noise.
This defect looks like sprinkles of sand and is similar in appearance to
film grain, a defect that often mars pictures taken with high ISO film.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Ideally, then, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your
camera — 100 — to ensure top image quality. But sometimes, the light-
ing conditions simply don’t permit you to do so and still use the aper-
ture and shutter speeds you need. As an example, I shot the rose images
in Figure 5-6 on a windy day. Even after I opened the aperture to f/5.6,
the maximum possible for the lens I was using, I needed a shutter speed
of 1/50 second to expose the image at ISO 100. Because the flower was
moving quite a bit in the wind, 1/50 second was too slow to capture it
without blur, as shown in the left image.
Fortunately, you usually don’t encounter serious noise with the Rebel
XTi/400D until you really crank up the ISO. You’d be hard pressed to find
noise in the ISO 200 example in Figure 5-6, for example. But take a look at
the examples in Figure 5-7, taken at ISO 800 and 1600. You may be able to
get away with ISO 800 if you keep the print or display size of the picture
small — as with other image defects, noise becomes more apparent as
you enlarge the photo. Noise also is more problematic in areas of flat

color. When you bump ISO all the way up to 1600, however, expect to 
see noise throughout the image, as in the right photo in the figure.
Just to give you a better look at how ISO affects noise, Figure 5-8 offers
magnified views of an area of my ISO 100, 200, 800, and 1600 images, plus
an additional shot captured at ISO 400.
One more important note about noise: A long exposure time — say, 1
second or more — also can produce this defect. Your camera has a 
built-in noise-reduction filter that aims to compensate for long-exposure
noise; see the sidebar “Dampening long-exposure noise” elsewhere in
this chapter for details.
Long story short, understanding how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect
your image enables you to have much more creative input over the look 
of your photographs — and, in the case of ISO, to also control the quality of
your images. (Chapter 3 discusses other factors that affect image quality.)

Doing the exposure balancing act
As you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter speed,
and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift in order to maintain the
same image brightness. If you want a faster shutter speed, for example, you
have to compensate with either a larger aperture, to allow in more light during
the shorter exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make the camera more sensi-
tive to the light, or both. And as the preceding section explains, changing
these settings impacts your image in ways beyond exposure. So when you
boost that shutter speed, you have to decide whether you prefer the shorter
depth of field that comes with a larger aperture or the increased risk of noise
that accompanies a higher ISO. Figure 5-9 offers an illustration to help you
envision this balancing act.
All photographers have their own approaches to finding the right combina-
tion of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, and you’ll no doubt develop your
own system as you become more practiced at using the advanced exposure
modes. In the meantime, here’s how I handle things:

ISO 200
ISO 400
ISO 800
ISO 1600

Figure 5-9: When adjusting exposure, remember the side 
effects produced by different aperture, shutter speed, and 
ISO settings.
 I always use the lowest possible ISO setting unless the lighting condi-
tions are so poor that I can’t use the aperture and shutter speed I want
without raising the ISO.
 If my subject is moving (or might move, as with a squiggly toddler or
antsy pet), I give shutter speed the next highest priority in my exposure
decision. I might choose a fast shutter speed to ensure a blur-free photo
or, on the flip side, select a slow shutter to intentionally blur that moving
object, an effect that can create a heightened sense of motion. When
shooting waterfalls, for example, I use a slow shutter to give the water 
a blurry, misty look.
 For images of non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over shut-
ter speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have in
mind. For portraits, for example, I use a wide-open aperture (low f-stop
number) so that I get a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft back-
ground for my subject. For landscapes, I go the opposite direction, stop-
ping down the aperture as much as possible to capture the subject at
the greatest depth of field.

I know that keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the
more you work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation will
make sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for spe-
cific types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for
details on how to actually monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and
ISO settings. And for specifics on selecting exposure settings in each of the
four advanced exposure mode, jump ahead to the section “Setting ISO, f-stop,
and Shutter Speed.”
Monitoring Exposure Settings
When you press the shutter button halfway, the current f-stop and shutter
speed appear in both the viewfinder display, as shown in Figure 5-10, and in
the Camera Settings display, as shown in Figure 5-11. For the ISO setting, you
must look to the Camera Settings display, as labeled in Figure 5-11.
In the viewfinder, shutter speeds are presented as whole numbers, even if the
shutter speed is set to a fraction of a second. For example, for a shutter speed
of 1/500 second, you see just the number 500 in the display. When the shutter
speed slows to 1 second or more, you see quote marks after the number in
both displays — 1" indicates a shutter speed of 1 second, 4" means 4 seconds,
and so on.
Putting the f (stop) in focus
One way to remember the relationship between
f-stop and depth of field, or the range of distance
over which objects remain in sharp focus, is
simply to think of the f as standing for focus. A
higher f-stop number produces a longer depth of
field, so if you want to extend the zone of sharp
focus to cover a larger distance from your sub-
ject, you set the aperture to a higher f-stop.
Higher f-stop number, greater zone of sharp
focus.
Please don’t share this tip with photography
elites, who will roll their eyes and inform you that
the f in f-stop most certainly does not stand for
focus but for the ratio between the aperture size
and lens focal length — as if that’s helpful to
know if you aren’t an optical engineer. (Chapter 6
explains focal length, which is helpful to know.)
As for the fact that you open the aperture to a
larger size by choosing a smaller f-stop number,
well, I’m still working on the ideal mnemonic tip
for that one. But try this in the meantime: A
smaller f-stop soaks the sensor with more light.
Or maybe this: A smaller f-stop produces a more
substantial aperture opening. (As I said, I’m work-
ing on it.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
In addition to showing you the current shutter speed and f-stop, the view-
finder and Camera Settings display also offer an exposure meter, labeled in
Figures 5-10 and 5-11. This little graphic serves two different purposes,
depending on which of the advanced exposure modes you’re using:
 In manual mode, the meter acts in its traditional role, which is to indicate
whether your current settings will properly expose the image. Figure 5-12
gives you three examples. When the exposure indicator aligns with the
center point, as in the middle example, the current settings will produce
a proper exposure. If the indicator moves to the left of center, toward the
minus side of the scale, as in the left example in the figure, the camera is
alerting you that the image will be underexposed. If the indicator moves
to the right of center, as in the right example, the image will be overex-
posed. The farther the indicator moves toward the plus or minus sign,
the greater the potential exposure problem.
 In the other modes (P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP), the meter displays the current
exposure compensation setting. Exposure compensation is a feature that
enables you to tell the camera to produce a brighter or darker exposure
than its autoexposure brain thinks is correct. When the exposure indica-
tor is at 0, no compensation is being applied. See the upcoming section
“Overriding Autoexposure Results with Exposure Compensation” for
details.
Figure 5-12: In Manual mode, the meter indicates whether exposure settings are on target.
Because the meter is designated as an exposure compensation guide when
you shoot in the P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes, the camera alerts you to expo-
sure problems in those modes as follows:
 Av mode (aperture-priority autoexposure): The shutter speed value
blinks to let you know that the camera can’t select a shutter speed that
will produce a good exposure at the aperture you selected. You need to
choose a different f-stop or adjust ISO.
 Tv mode (shutter-priority autoexposure): The aperture value blinks
instead of the shutter speed. That’s your notification that the camera
can’t open or stop down the aperture enough to expose the image at
your selected shutter speed. Your options are to change the shutter
speed or ISO.
Underexposed
Correct exposure
Overexposed
Exposure indicator

 P mode (programmed autoexposure): In P mode, both the aperture and
shutter speed values blink if the light is such that the camera can’t select
a combination of the two that will properly expose the image. Your only
recourse is to either adjust the lighting or change the ISO setting.
 A-DEP mode (auto depth-of-field): Either the aperture or shutter speed
value may blink. If the shutter speed value blinks 30" or 4000, the light is
too dark or too bright, respectively, for the camera to expose the image
properly at any combination of aperture and shutter speed. To compen-
sate for dim lighting, you can raise the ISO or add flash or another light
source. In too-bright light, lower the ISO if possible — otherwise, find a
way to shade the subject or relocate it.
If the aperture setting blinks, the camera’s telling you that the exposure
will be okay, but the f-stop won’t produce the depth of field needed to
keep everything in the frame in sharp focus. (See Chapter 6 for complete
details on depth of field and the A-DEP mode.)
One more word of advice: Keep in mind that the camera’s take on exposure
may not always be the one you want to follow. First, the camera’s exposure
decisions are based on the current exposure metering mode. As covered next,
you can choose three different metering modes, and each one calculates
exposure on a different area of the frame. Second, you may want to purposely
choose exposure settings that leave parts of the image very dark or parts
very light for creative reasons. For example, in a sunset scene, you may want
to choose exposure settings that leave the foreground very dark but capture
the fading colors of the sky properly. Again, depending on the metering
mode, the camera may not understand your creative intent and report an
exposure problem. In other words, the meter and the blinking alerts are
guides, not dictators.
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
The metering mode determines which part of the frame the camera analyzes
to calculate the proper exposure. Your Canon offers three metering modes,
described in the following list and represented in the Camera Settings display
by the icons you see in the margins:
 Evaluative metering: The camera analyzes the entire frame and then
selects an exposure that’s designed to produce a balanced exposure.
 Partial metering: The camera bases exposure only on the light that falls
in the center portion of the frame. 
 Center-Weighted Average metering: The camera bases exposure on the
entire frame but with puts extra emphasis — or weight — on the center.
105
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

106
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
In most cases, Evaluative metering does a good job of calculating exposure.
But it can get thrown off when a dark subject is set against a bright back-
ground or vice versa. As an example, Figure 5-13 shows the same image cap-
tured in P (programmed auto) mode, with no changes to exposure settings
between shots except to the metering mode. In the Evaluative example, the
amount of bright background caused the camera to select an exposure that
left the statue too dark. Partial metering, in which the camera based expo-
sure just on the center of the frame, did a good job exposing the statue, 
but the background then became a little overexposed for my taste. Center-
Weighted Average metering produced a better background but left the statue
just a tad underexposed.
Sadly, there is no way to get both background and subject properly exposed
in situations like this, so you just have to decide which part of the image is
most important.
Figure 5-13: The metering mode determines which area of the frame the camera considers when calculating
exposure.
You don’t have a choice of metering modes in any of the fully automatic expo-
sure modes; the camera uses Evaluative mode for all shots. But in the
advanced exposure modes, you can specify which metering mode you prefer,
as follows:
1. Press the left cross key.
The key is marked with the same little icon that represents Evaluative
metering mode (the left icon in Figure 5-14). The monitor then displays
the screen you see in the figure.
Evaluative
Partial
Center-Weighted Average

Figure 5-14: Press the left cross key to access your metering 
mode options.
2. Press the left or right cross key to highlight your choice.
You can also rotate the Main dial to highlight the option.
3. Press the Set button.
Your selected metering mode remains in force until you change it.
In theory, the best practice is to always check the metering mode before you
shoot and choose the one that best matches your exposure goals. But in
practice, that’s a bit of a pain, not just in terms of having to adjust yet one
more capture setting but in terms of having to remember to adjust one more
capture setting.
So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the other controls
on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which is Evaluative meter-
ing. That mode produces good results in most situations, and, after all, you
can see in the monitor whether you disagree with how the camera metered or
exposed the image and simply reshoot after adjusting the exposure settings to
your liking. This option, in my mind, makes the whole metering mode issue a
lot less critical than it is when you shoot with film.
The one exception to this advice might be when you’re shooting a series of
images in which a significant contrast in lighting exists between subject and
background, as my examples here. Then, switching to Partial or Center-
Weighted Average metering may save you the time of having to adjust the
exposure for each image.

Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed
If you want to control ISO, aperture (f-stop), or shutter speed, you must set
the camera to one of the five advanced exposure modes. Formally called
Creative Zone modes in Canon nomenclature, these modes include pro-
grammed auto (P), shutter-priority autoexposure (Tv), aperture-priority 
autoexposure (Av), manual exposure (M), and auto depth-of-field (A-DEP).
I explain each of these modes at the start of the chapter, but Table 5-1 offers a
quick recap, along with a recommendation of when to use each mode. (In 
the table, the initials AE stand for autoexposure.) The next sections provide
specifics (finally, you say) on how to adjust ISO, aperture, and shutter speed
in all five modes.

in the frame in sharp focus.
Controlling ISO
As explained at the start of this chapter, your camera’s ISO setting controls
how sensitive the image sensor is to light. At higher ISO values, you need 
less light to expose an image.
Remember the downside to raising ISO however: The higher the ISO, the
greater the possibility of noisy images. See Figure 5-8 for a reminder of what
that defect looks like.
In the fully automatic exposure modes, the camera selects an ISO of 100, 200,
or 400, depending on the available light. You have no control over ISO in
those exposure modes. In the advanced exposure modes, you can specify an
ISO setting from 100 to 1600.
The current ISO is displayed in the upper-right corner of the Camera Settings
display, as shown on the left in Figure 5-15. To adjust the setting, just press
the top cross key — the one that sports the label ISO. You then see the screen
shown on the right in the figure. Use the cross keys or rotate the Main dial to
highlight your choice. Then press the Set button.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Dampening long-exposure image noise
Even if you set your camera to a low ISO value,
images may still suffer from noise when you use
a very slow shutter speed. The longer the expo-
sure, the greater the chances of this digital
defect, which gives your pictures a mottled look. 
The Rebel XTi/400D offers an in-camera filter that
is designed to help eradicate the type of noise
that occurs during long exposures. This feature
is provided through a Custom Function, however,
which means that you can access it only in the
advanced exposure modes. To check it out, visit
Setup Menu 2, select Custom Functions, press
Set, and then use the cross keys or Main dial to
select Custom Function 2, as shown in the figure
here. Press Set again to activate the scrolling list
of options in the middle of the screen. You can
choose from these settings: 
 Off: No noise reduction is applied. This is the
default setting.
 Auto: Noise reduction is applied when you
use a shutter speed of 1 second or longer, but
only if the camera detects the type of noise
that’s caused by long exposures.
 On: Noise reduction is always applied at
exposures of 1 second or longer.
Before you enable noise reduction, be aware that
doing so has a couple of disadvantages. First, the
filter is applied after you take the picture, as the
camera processes the image data and records it
to your memory card. The time needed to apply
the filter is about the same as the original expo-
sure time, which slows down your shooting
speed.
Second, noise-reduction filters work primarily by
applying a slight blur to the image. Don’t expect
this process to totally eliminate noise, and do
expect some resulting image softness. You may
be able to get better results by using the blur tools
or noise-removal filters found in many photo edi-
tors because then you can blur just the parts of
the image where noise is most noticeable —
usually in areas of flat color or little detail, such
as skies.

Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
You can adjust aperture and shutter speed only in P, Tv, Av, and M exposure
modes. In A-DEP mode, the camera forces you to use its selected exposure
settings. (You can, however, tweak the exposure by using the exposure-
compensation feature discussed in the next section.)
To see the current exposure settings, start by pressing the shutter button
halfway. The following things then take place:
 The camera locks focus, and the exposure meter comes to life.
 The current aperture and shutter speed appear in the viewfinder. (If you
take your eye away from the viewfinder, the Camera Settings display
appears, and you can view aperture and shutter speed there instead.)
 In Manual mode, the exposure meter also lets you know whether the
current settings will expose the image properly. In the other advanced
exposure modes — Tv, Av, P, and A-DEP — the camera indicates an 
exposure problem not with the meter, but by flashing either the shutter
speed or f-stop value. (See the section “Monitoring Exposure Settings,”
earlier in this chapter, for details.)
The technique you use to change the exposure settings depends on the expo-
sure mode, as outlined in the following list: 
 P (programmed auto): In this mode, the camera initially displays its rec-
ommended combination of aperture and shutter speed. To select a dif-
ferent combination, rotate the Main dial.
• To select a lower f-stop number (larger aperture) and faster shutter
speed, rotate the dial to the right.
• To select a higher f-stop number (smaller aperture) and slower
shutter speed, rotate the dial to the left.
 Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Main dial to the right for
a faster shutter speed; nudge it to the left for a slower speed. As you
change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the aperture
as needed to maintain the proper exposure.
Remember that as the aperture shifts, so does depth of field — so even
though you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the f-stop,
too, if depth of field is important to your photo. Also note that in extreme
lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the aperture
enough to produce a good exposure at your current shutter speed —
again, possible aperture settings depend on your lens. So you may need 
to compromise on shutter speed (or, in dim lighting, raise the ISO).
111
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

112
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 Av (aperture-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Main dial to the right to
stop down the aperture to a higher f-stop number. Rotate the dial to the
left to open the aperture to a lower f-stop number. As you do, the camera
automatically adjusts the shutter speed to maintain the exposure.
If you’re handholding the camera, be careful that the shutter speed
doesn’t drop so low when you stop down the aperture that you run the
risk of camera shake. And if your scene contains moving objects, make
sure that when you dial in your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that
the camera selects is fast enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur
it, if that’s your creative goal).
 M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and shut-
ter speed, like so:
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the Main dial to the right for a faster
shutter speed; rotate left for a slower shutter. 
• To adjust aperture: Press and hold the Exposure Compensation
button, shown in Figure 5-16, as you rotate the Main dial.
See the Av label under the button? That’s your cue as to the aperture-
related function of the button — Av stands for aperture value.
Figure 5-16: To set aperture in M mode, press the Exposure 
Compensation button as you rotate the Main dial.
Exposure Compensation button

Rotate the dial to the right for a higher f-stop (smaller aperture);
rotate left to select a lower f-stop. Don’t let up on the button as 
you rotate the Main dial — if you do, you instead adjust the shutter
speed.
Keep in mind that when you use P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes, the settings that
the camera selects are based on what it thinks is the proper exposure. If you
don’t agree with the camera, you have two options: You can switch to Manual
exposure mode and simply dial in the aperture and shutter speed that deliver
the exposure you want; or if you want to stay in P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP mode, you
can tweak the autoexposure settings by using the feature explained in the
very next section.
Overriding Autoexposure Results 
with Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP exposure modes, you
can enjoy the benefits of autoexposure support but still retain control over
the final, overall exposure. If you think that the image the camera produced is
too dark or too light, you can use a feature known as exposure compensation,
which is sometimes also called EV compensation. (The EV stands for exposure
value.)
Whatever you call it, this feature enables you to tell the camera to produce a
darker or lighter exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks is
appropriate. Best of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the
whole camera to understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 Exposure compensation settings are stated in terms of EV values, as in
+2.0 EV. Possible values range from +2.0 EV to –2.0 EV.
 A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment. 
 For a brighter image, you raise the EV value. The higher you go, the
brighter the image becomes.
 For a darker image, you lower the EV value. The picture becomes pro-
gressively darker with each step down the EV scale.
Each full number on the EV scale represents an exposure shift of one full stop.
In plain English, that means that if you change the exposure compensation
setting from EV 0.0 to EV –1.0, the camera adjusts either the aperture or shut-
ter speed to allow half as much light into the camera as you would get at the
current setting. If you instead raise the value to EV +1.0, the settings are
adjusted to double the light.
113
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

114
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
By default, the exposure is adjusted in 1/3 stop increments. In other words,
you can shift from EV 0.0 to EV +0.3, +0.7, +1.0, and so on. But you can change
the adjustment to 1/2-stop increments if you want to shift the exposure in
larger jumps — from EV 0.0 to EV +0.5, +1.0, and so on. To do so, display Setup
Menu 2, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set. Then select Custom
Function 6, press Set, and press the up or down cross key to change the set-
ting. Press Set again to lock in the new setting. If you make this change, the
meter will appear slightly different in the Camera Settings display than you
see it in this book. (There will be only one intermediate notch between each
number on the meter instead of the usual two.) The viewfinder meter does
not change, but the exposure indicator bar appears as a double-line if you set
the exposure compensation value to a half-step value (+0.5, +1.5, and so on). 
Exposure compensation is especially helpful when your subject and back-
ground are significantly different in brightness. As an example, take a look 
at the first image in Figure 5-17. Because of the very bright sky in the back-
ground, the camera chose an exposure that left the palm tree too dark. So I
just amped the exposure compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced
the brighter exposure on the right.
Figure 5-17: For a brighter exposure than the autoexposure mechanism chooses, dial in a 
positive exposure compensation value.
EV 0.0
EV +1.0

Another possible way to cope with this kind of background/subject bright-
ness variation is to adjust the exposure metering mode, as discussed earlier
in this chapter. I took the images in Figure 5-17 in Evaluative mode, for exam-
ple, which meters exposure on the entire frame. Switching to Partial or
Center-Weighted Average metering might have done the trick, but frankly, I
find it easier to use exposure compensation than to fool with metering mode
adjustments in most situations.
Some photographers use a slightly lower exposure compensation value —
say, minus 0.3 — for all their shots. The thinking is that while this setting may
underexpose some images, resulting in a little necessary retouching work
later, it helps protect against blown highlights, which are usually not easy 
to repair. 
Whatever your reason for adjusting the exposure compensation setting, you
can get the job done as follows:
1. Hold down the Exposure Compensation button.
The button’s located near the top-right corner of the camera monitor; you
can see the button in the margin here and in Figure 5-16. If the Camera
Settings display is active, the exposure meter becomes highlighted, as
shown in Figure 5-18. If you’re looking through the viewfinder, nothing
appears to change, however.
Figure 5-18: In autoexposure modes, the meter indicates the 
exposure compensation setting.

2. While keeping the button pressed, rotate the Main dial to change the
exposure compensation value.
As you rotate the dial, the exposure indicator moves right or left along
the exposure meter.
• Rotate the dial to the left to lower the value and produce a darker
exposure.
• Rotate the dial to the right to raise the value and produce a
brighter exposure.
• To return to no adjustment, rotate the dial until the exposure indi-
cator is back at the center position on the meter.
3. Release the Exposure Compensation button after you select the value
you want to use.
How the camera arrives at the brighter or darker image you request depends
on the exposure mode:
 In Av (aperture-priority) mode, the camera adjusts the shutter speed but
leaves your selected f-stop in force. Be sure to check the resulting shut-
ter speed to make sure that it isn’t so slow that camera shake or blur
from moving objects is problematic. 
 In Tv (shutter-priority) mode, the opposite occurs: The camera opens or
stops down the aperture, leaving your selected shutter speed alone.
 In P (programmed auto) and A-DEP mode, the camera decides whether
to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or both to accommodate the exposure
compensation setting.
However, the camera can adjust the aperture only so much, according to the
aperture range of your lens. And the range of shutter speeds, too, is limited
by the camera itself. So if you reach the ends of those ranges, you either have
to compromise on shutter speed or aperture or adjust ISO.
One final, and critical point about exposure compensation: When you power
off the camera, it doesn’t return you to a neutral setting (EV 0.0). The setting
you last used remains in force until you change it.
Using Autoexposure Lock
Occasionally, you may want to use the exact same exposure settings for a
series of shots. For example, suppose that you’re shooting several images 
of a large landscape that you want to join together into a panorama in your
photo editor. Unless the lighting is even across the entire landscape, the
camera may select different exposure settings for each shot, depending on

which part of the scene is currently in the frame. That can lead to weird and
noticeable breaks in the brightness and contrast of the image when you seam
the image together.
To lock in exposure, you can
simply switch to M (manual)
exposure mode and use the same
settings for each shot. Or, if you
prefer to take advantage of auto-
exposure, you can press and hold
the AE (autoexposure) Lock
button, highlighted in Figure 5-19.
Exposure remains locked for as
long as you press the button,
even if you release the shutter
button.
You can even go one step further
and customize the behavior of
the AE Lock button via a Custom
Function. You can swap the tasks
of the shutter button and AE 
Lock button, for example, so 
that pressing the shutter button
halfway locks exposure and
pressing the AE Lock button locks focus. Chapter 11 offers details. (When
working with this book, however, stick with the default arrangement so that
my instructions work as they should.)
Bracketing Exposures Automatically
One of my favorite exposure features on the Rebel XTi/400D is automatic
exposure bracketing, or AEB for short. This feature makes it easy to bracket
exposures — which simply means to take the same shot using several expo-
sure settings to up the odds that you come away with a perfectly exposed
image.
When you enable AEB, your first shot is recorded at the current exposure set-
tings; the second, with settings that produce a darker image; and the third,
with settings that produce a brighter image. You can specify how much change
in exposure you want between the three images when you turn on the feature.
You can take advantage of AEB in any of the advanced exposure modes.
However, the feature isn’t available when you use flash. If you want to bracket
exposures when using flash, you have to do it yourself, either by using expo-
sure compensation or, in manual exposure mode, by changing the aperture
and shutter speed directly.

Speaking of exposure compensation, you can combine that feature with AEB
if you want. The camera simply applies the compensation amount when it
calculates the exposure for the three bracketed images.
With that preamble out of the way, take these steps to turn on AEB:
1. Display Setup Menu 2 and highlight AEB, as shown on the left in
Figure 5-20.
Figure 5-20: Auto exposure bracketing records your image at three exposure settings.
2. Press Set to activate the little exposure meter, as shown on the right in
Figure 5-20.
3. Rotate the Main dial to establish the amount of exposure change you
want between images.
You now see three exposure indicators under the meter. These indica-
tors show you the amount of exposure shift between the three shots 
the camera will record. As with the Exposure Compensation meter, each
whole number represents one full exposure stop.
For example, if you use the setting shown in Figure 5-20, the camera
shoots one image at the actual exposure settings, and then takes the
second image using settings that allow half as much light into the
camera. The third image is recorded using settings that allow twice 
as much light.
4. Press Set.
AEB is now enabled. If you press the shutter button halfway, you see the
icon labeled in Figure 5-21 in the Camera Settings display, which reminds
you that you turned on the feature. In the viewfinder, a flashing asterisk
appears instead. In both displays, the exposure meter also displays the
three exposure indicators to represent the exposure shift you estab-
lished in Step 3.

Figure 5-21: These symbols remind you that automatic 
exposure bracketing is enabled.
How you actually record your trio of exposures depends on whether the Drive
mode is set to Single or Continuous. The Drive mode, which I introduce in
Chapter 2, determines whether the camera records a single image or multiple
images with each press of the shutter button. (Press the Drive mode button,
shown in the margin here, to access the screen that enables you to change
this setting.)
 AEB in Single mode: You take each exposure separately, pressing the
shutter button fully three times to record your trio of images. 
If you forget which exposure you’re taking, look at the exposure meter.
After you press the shutter button halfway to lock focus, the meter shows
just a single indicator bar instead of three. If the bar is at 0, you’re ready
to take the first capture. If it’s to the left of 0, you’re on capture two, which
creates the darker exposure. If it’s to the right of 0, you’re on capture
three, which produces the brightest image.
 AEB in Continuous mode: The camera records all three exposures with
one press of the shutter button. To record another series, release and
then press the shutter button again. In other words, when AEB is turned
on, the camera doesn’t keep recording images until you release the shut-
ter button as it normally does in Continuous mode — you can take only
three images with one press of the shutter button.
To turn off auto exposure bracketing, just revisit Setup Menu 2 and change
the AEB setting back to 0.

AEB is also turned off when you power down the camera, enable the flash,
replace the camera battery, or replace the memory card.
Using Flash in Advanced Exposure Modes
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO pro-
duces a bright enough exposure — in which case, you simply have to add
more light. The built-in flash on your camera offers the most convenient 
solution.
To engage the flash, just press the Flash button on the side of the camera,
highlighted in Figure 5-22. To turn off the flash, just press down on the flash
assembly to close it.
Figure 5-22: Want flash? Just press the Flash button, and you’re set 
to go. 
As you can in the fully automatic modes, you also can set the flash to Red-eye
Reduction mode. Just display Shooting Menu 1 and turn the Red Eye option
Flash button

on or off. When enabled, the camera emits a brief preflash before the actual
flash in an effort to constrict the subject’s pupils and thereby lessen the
chances of red-eye.
The next section goes into a little background detail about how the camera
calculates the flash power that’s needed to expose the image. This stuff is a
little technical, but it will help you better understand how to get the results
you want because the flash performance varies depending on the exposure
mode.
Following that discussion, the rest of the chapter covers advanced flash fea-
tures, including flash exposure compensation and flash exposure lock. You’ll
find some tips on getting better results in your flash pictures as well. For
details on using Red-eye Reduction flash, flip back to Chapter 2, which spells
everything out. Be sure to also visit Chapter 7, where you can find additional
flash and lighting tips related to specific types of photographs.
Understanding your camera’s approach to flash
When you use flash, your camera automatically calculates and adjusts the flash
power to match the light on the subject. This process is sometimes referred to
as flash metering. Your Rebel XTi/400D uses a flash-metering system that Canon
calls E-TTL II. The E stands for evaluative; TTL, for through the lens. And the II
refers to the fact that this system is an update to an earlier version of the
system.
It isn’t important that you remember what the initials stand for or even the
flash system’s official name. But what is helpful to keep in mind is how 
the system is designed to work.
First, you need to know that a flash can be used in two basic ways: as the pri-
mary light source or as a fill flash. When flash is the primary light source,
both the subject and background are lit by the flash. In dim lighting, this typi-
cally results in a brightly lit subject and a dark background, as shown on the
left in Figure 5-23.
With fill flash, the background is exposed primarily by ambient light, and the
flash adds a little extra illumination to the subject. Fill flash typically pro-
duces brighter backgrounds and, often, softer lighting of the subject because
not as much flash power is needed. The downside is that if the ambient light
is dim, as in my nighttime photo, you need a slow shutter speed to properly
expose the image, and both the camera and the subject must remain very
still to avoid blurring. The shutter speed for my fill-flash image was 1/30
second, for example. Fortunately, I had a tripod, and the deer didn’t seem
inclined to move.
121
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

122
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-23: Fill flash produces brighter backgrounds.
Neither choice is necessarily right or wrong, by the way: Whether you want 
a dark background depends on the scene and your artistic interpretation. If
you want to diminish the background, you may prefer the darker background
you get when you use flash as your primary light source. But if the back-
ground is important to the context of the shot, allowing the camera to absorb
more ambient light and adding just a small bit of fill flash may be more to
your liking.
One more note on flash: Although most people think of flash as a tool for
nighttime and low-light photography, most outdoor daytime pictures, espe-
cially portraits, also benefit from a little fill flash. As a case in point, Figure 5-24
shows you the same scene, shot at a farmer’s market on a sunny morning, cap-
tured with and without fill flash.
Using a flash in bright sunlight also produces a slight warming effect, as illus-
trated in Figure 5-24. This color shift occurs because when you enable the
flash, the camera’s white balancing mechanism warms color slightly to com-
pensate for the bluish light of a flash. But because your scene is actually lit
primarily by sunlight, which is not as cool as flash light, the white balance
adjustment takes the image colors a step warmer than neutral. If you don’t
want this warming effect, see Chapter 6 to find out how to make a manual
white balance adjustment.
Flash as primary light source
Fill flash

Figure 5-24: Flash often improves daytime pictures outdoors.
So how does this little flash lesson relate to your camera? Well, the exposure
mode you use (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP) determines whether the flash operates
as a fill flash or as the primary light source. The exposure mode also controls
the extent to which the camera adjusts the aperture and shutter speed in
response to the ambient light in the scene.
In all modes, the camera analyzes the light both in the background and on
the subject. Then it calculates the exposure and flash output as follows: 
 P: In this mode, the shutter speed is automatically set between 1/60 and
1/200 second. (The bottom end of the range is set to allow handheld
shooting without camera shake.) If the ambient light is sufficient, the
flash output is geared to providing fill-flash lighting. Otherwise, the flash
is determined to be the primary light source, and the output is adjusted
accordingly. In the latter event, the image background may be dark, as in
the left example in Figure 5-23.
 Tv: In this mode, the flash defaults to fill-flash behavior. After you select
a shutter speed, the camera determines the proper aperture to expose
the background with ambient light. Then it sets the flash power to pro-
vide fill-flash lighting to the subject.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
You can select a shutter speed between 30 seconds and 1/200 second. If
the aperture (f-stop) setting blinks, the camera can’t expose the back-
ground properly at the shutter speed you selected. You can adjust either
the shutter speed or ISO to correct the problem.
 Av: Again, the flash is designed to serve as fill-flash lighting. After you
set the f-stop, the camera selects the shutter speed needed to expose
the background using only ambient light. The flash power is then geared
to fill in shadows on the subject.
Depending on the ambient light and your selected f-stop, the camera
sets the shutter speed at anywhere from 30 seconds to 1/200 second. So
be sure to note the shutter speed before you shoot — at anything below
about 1/60 second, you may need a tripod to avoid camera shake. Your
subject also must stay very still to avoid blurring.
If you want to avoid the possibil-
ity of a slow shutter altogether,
you can, however. Display Setup
Menu 2, select Custom Functions,
and press Set. Then select
Custom Function 3, as shown in
Figure 5-25. At the Auto setting,
the camera operates as just
described. If you instead select
the 1/200 second option, the
shutter speed is always set to
that value when you use flash.
This ensures that you can hand-
hold the camera without blur, but
obviously, in dim lighting, it can
result in a dark background
because the camera doesn’t have time to soak up much ambient light.
 M: In this mode, the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO setting you select
determine how brightly the background will be exposed. The camera
takes care of illuminating the subject with fill flash.
 A-DEP: You can use flash in this mode, but doing so disables the auto-
matic depth-of-field feature. The flash and exposure systems then oper-
ate as described for P mode. However, you can’t choose from multiple
combinations of aperture and shutter speed as you can in that mode;
you’re stuck with the combination that the camera selects.
If the flash output in any mode isn’t to your liking, you can adjust it by using
flash exposure compensation, explained next. Also check out the upcoming
section “Locking flash exposure” for another trick you can use to manipulate
flash results.
Keep in mind, too, that in any autoexposure mode, you can use exposure
compensation, discussed earlier, to tweak the ambient exposure — that is,
the brightness of your background. So you have multiple points of control:
Figure 5-25: You can limit the camera to a
fast shutter when using Av mode with flash.

exposure compensation to manipulate the background brightness, and flash
compensation and flash exposure lock to adjust the flash output.
Adjusting flash power with flash 
exposure compensation
When you shoot with your built-in flash, the camera attempts to adjust the
flash output as needed to produce a good exposure in the current lighting
conditions. On some occasions, you may find that you want a little more or
less light than the camera thinks is appropriate.
You can adjust the flash output by using a feature called flash compensation. This
feature works similarly to exposure compensation, discussed earlier in this chap-
ter. But flash compensation affects the output level of the flash unit, whereas
exposure compensation affects the brightness of the background in your flash
photos. As with exposure compensation, the flash compensation settings are
stated in terms of EV (exposure value) numbers. A setting of 0.0 indicates no
flash adjustment; you can increase the flash power to +2.0 or decrease it to –2.0.
As an example of the benefit of this feature — again, available only when you
shoot in the advanced exposure modes — take a look at Figure 5-26. I snapped
these tomatoes during bright daylight, but they were shaded by a tent
awning. The first image shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I needed a little
more light, but at normal flash power, the flash was too strong, blowing out
the highlights in some areas, as shown in the middle image. By dialing the
flash power down to EV –1.3, I got a softer flash that straddled the line per-
fectly between no flash and too much flash.
Figure 5-26: When normal flash output is too strong, dial in a lower flash compensation setting.
No flash
Flash EV 0.0
Flash EV –1.3

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a flash
compensation of +2.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and you simply
can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other words, don’t
even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from your seat in the
balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.
Whichever direction you want to go with flash power, display Shooting Menu 2
and highlight the Flash Exp Comp option, as shown on the left in Figure 5-27.
Press Set to activate the little meter and then rotate the Main dial to specify
the amount of flash compensation. A higher value increases flash output; a
lower value reduces it. 
Figure 5-27: Adjust flash power via Shooting Menu 2.
By the way, if you use flash exposure compensation a lot, you can customize
the camera so that pressing the Set button displays that control, saving you
the trouble of using the menus. Chapter 11 shows you how.
To let you know that flash compensation is in effect, the icon labeled on the
right in Figure 5-27 appears in the Camera Settings display when you press
the shutter button halfway. You see the same plus/minus flash symbol in the
viewfinder, although this time without the actual flash exposure compensa-
tion value.
As with exposure compensation, any flash-power adjustment you make
remains in force, even if you turn off the camera, until you reset the control.
So be sure to check the setting before you next use your flash.
Flash exposure compensation setting

Locking the flash exposure
You might never notice it, but when you press the shutter button to take a
picture with flash enabled, the camera emits a very brief preflash before 
the actual flash. This preflash is used to determine the proper flash power
needed to expose the image.
On occasion, the information that the camera collects from the preflash can
be off-target because of the assumptions the system makes about what area
of the frame is likely to contain your subject. To address this problem, your
camera has a feature called flash exposure lock, or FE Lock. This tool enables
you to set the flash power based only on the center of the frame.
Follow these steps to try it out:
1. Frame your photo so that your subject falls under the center autofocus
point.
You want your subject smack in the middle of the frame. You can reframe
the shot after locking the flash exposure if you want.
2. Press the shutter button halfway down until autofocus is complete, as
indicated by the green confirmation dot in the viewfinder.
At this point, focus is set on your subject. You can now lift your finger off
the shutter button if you want.
3. While the subject is still under the center autofocus point, press and
release the AE Lock button.
You can see the button in the margin here. The camera emits the pre-
flash, and the letters FEL display for a second in the viewfinder. (FEL
stands for flash exposure lock.) You also see the asterisk symbol — the
one that appears above the AE Lock button on the camera body — next
to the flash icon in the viewfinder. 
4. If needed, press and hold the shutter button halfway to re-establish
focus on your subject.
You only need to take this step if you released the shutter button after
Step 2.
5. Reframe the image to your desired composition.
Keep the shutter button pressed halfway to maintain focus.
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
The image is captured using the flash output setting you established in
Step 3.
127
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

128
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Flash exposure lock is also helpful when you’re shooting portraits. The pre-
flash sometimes causes people to blink, which means that with normal flash
shooting, in which the actual flash and exposure occur immediately after the
preflash, their eyes are closed at the exact moment of the exposure. With
flash exposure lock, you can fire the preflash and then wait a second or two
for the subject’s eyes to recover before you take the actual picture.
Better yet, the flash exposure setting remains in force for about 15 seconds,
meaning that you can shoot a series of images using the same flash setting
without firing another preflash at all. 
Exploring flash Custom Functions
Through the Custom Functions options, found on Setup Menu 2, you can cus-
tomize three aspects of your camera’s flash behavior. These options work as
follows:
 Custom Function 3, Flash Sync Speed in Av Mode: This Custom
Function determines what shutter speeds the camera can select when
you use flash in the Av (aperture-priority autoexposure) mode. At the
default setting, which is Auto, the shutter may be set to any speed
between 30 seconds and 1/200 second. But you can also limit the camera
to a shutter speed of 1/200 second through Custom Function 3. Doing so
eliminates the possibility that a slow shutter speed will result in a blurry
image due to camera shake, but it can also result in dark backgrounds.
See the earlier section “Understanding your camera’s approach to flash”
for details about using flash in the various exposure modes. 
 Custom Function 8, E-TTL II: This option enables you to switch from 
the default flash metering approach, called Evaluative. In this mode, the
camera operates as described in the earlier section, “Understanding
your camera’s approach to flash.” That is, it exposes the background
using ambient light when possible and then sets the flash power to
serve as fill light on the subject.
If you set this Custom Function instead to the Average option, the flash
is used as the primary light source, meaning that the flash power is set
to expose the entire scene without relying on ambient light. Typically,
this results in a more powerful (and possibly harsh) flash lighting and
dark backgrounds.
 Custom Function 9, Shutter Curtain Sync: By default, the flash fires at
the beginning of the exposure. This flash timing, known as first-curtain
sync, is the best choice for most subjects. However, if you use a very
slow shutter speed and you’re photographing a moving object, first-
curtain sync causes the blur that results from the motion to appear in
front of the object, which doesn’t make much visual sense. 
To solve this problem, Custom Function 9 enables you to change the
flash sync timing to second-curtain sync, also known as rear-curtain sync.

In that flash mode, the motion trails will appear behind the moving
object. The flash actually fires twice in this mode: once when you press
the shutter button and again at the end of the exposure.
As you can probably discern from these descriptions, these Custom Functions
are designed for photographers who are schooled in flash photography and
want to mess around with advanced flash options. If you fall into that category,
you can access the options by displaying Setup Menu 2, highlighting Custom
Functions, and then pressing the Set button. After the Custom Function screen
appears, use the right or left cross key to select the function you want to
change. For example, in the left image in Figure 5-28, I selected Custom
Function 8; in the right image, Custom Function 9. 
Figure 5-28: Both of these Custom Functions are designed for advanced users.
Press Set to activate the scrolling list of options in the center of the screen, as
shown in the figures. Press the up or down cross key to select your choice
and then press Set again to lock in that option.
Using an external flash unit
In addition to its built-in flash, your camera has a hot shoe, which is photo-
geek terminology for a connection that enables you to add an external flash
head like the one shown in Figure 5-29. The figure features the Canon
Speedlite 580EX II, which currently retails for right around $350.
Although certainly not the cheapest of camera accessories, an external flash
may be a worthwhile investment if you do a lot of flash photography, especially
portraits. For one thing, an external flash offers greater power, enabling you to
illuminate a larger area than you can with a built-in flash. And with flash units
like the one in Figure 5-29, you can rotate the flash head so that the flash light
bounces off a wall or ceiling instead of hitting your subject directly. This results
in softer lighting and can eliminate the harsh shadows often caused by the
strong, narrowly focused light of a built-in flash. (Chapter 7 offers an example
of the difference this lighting technique can make in portraits.)
129
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

130
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Whether the investment in an external flash will be worthwhile depends on
the kind of photography you want to do. However, if you simply want a softer,
more diffused light than your built-in flash produces, you have another option:
You can buy a flash diffuser attachment like the one shown in Figure 5-30. This
diffuser, made by LumiQuest (www.lumiquest.com), sells for just $13 and is 
a heck of a lot lighter and smaller to tuck into your camera bag than a flash
head. This is just one of many diffuser designs, so visit your camera store to
compare all your options.
If you do decide to purchase an external flash, you may also want to dig into
some of the many books that concentrate solely on flash photography.
There’s a lot more to that game than you may imagine, and you’ll no doubt
discover some great ideas about lighting your pictures with flash. You can
start with Chapter 7, which provides some specific examples of how to get
better flash results when you shoot portraits, whether you go with the built-
in flash, an external flash, or, my favorite, no flash.
Figure 5-29: An external flash with a rotating 
head offers greater lighting flexibility.

Figure 5-30: If you don’t own an external flash head,

in flash.

o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied
to a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. And it’s true,
this characteristic of your photographs is an important one. There’s not
much to appreciate about an image that’s so blurry that you can’t make out
whether you’re looking at Peru or Peoria.
But an artful photographer knows that there’s more to focus
than simply getting a sharp image of a subject. You also
need to consider depth of field, or the distance over
which objects remain sharply focused. This chapter
explains all the ways to control depth of field and 
also discusses how to use your Canon’s advanced
autofocus options.
In addition, this chapter dives into the topic of color,
explaining such concepts as white balancing, which
compensates for the varying color casts created by
different light sources, and color space, which deter-
mines the spectrum of colors your camera can capture.
Finally, a section near the end of the chapter introduces you
to Picture Styles, which enable you to take even greater control
over image sharpness and color.

Reviewing Focus Basics
I touch on various focus issues in Chapters 1, 2, and 5. But just in case you’re
not reading this book from front to back, here’s a recap of the basic process
of focusing with your Rebel XTi/400D:
1. If you haven’t already done so, adjust the viewfinder to your eyesight.
Look through the viewfinder and pay attention only to the autofocus
points, labeled in Figure 6-1. Then nudge the dioptric adjustment knob
until the brackets themselves appear sharp — don’t worry about the
scene in front of the lens. (The knob is located just to the right of the
viewfinder; Chapter 1 details this step if you need more help.)
2. Set the focusing switch on the lens to manual or automatic focusing.
If you want to focus manually, set the switch to the MF position. For auto-
focusing, set the switch to the AF position, as in Figure 6-2. (These 
directions are specific to the kit lens sold with the Rebel XTi/D400,
shown in the figure. If you use another lens, the switch may look or oper-
ate differently, so check the product manual.)
Figure 6-1: The viewfinder offers these focusing aids.
Autofocus points

3. To set focus in autofocus
mode, press and hold the
shutter button halfway down.
When focus is established, the
focus indicator in the view-
finder lights, and one or more
of the autofocus points turns
red, as shown in Figure 6-1.
Focus is maintained as long 
as you continue to hold the
shutter button down halfway.
(Press the button the rest of
the way when you’re ready to
snap the picture.)
A red dot indicates an active
autofocus point, which the
camera will use to establish
focus. You can select a specific
autofocus point by following
the steps laid out in the next
section. 
4. To set focus manually, twist
the focusing ring on the lens.
Note that even in manual mode, you can confirm focus by pressing the
shutter button halfway. The autofocus point or points that achieved
focus flash for a second or two, and the viewfinder’s focus indicator
lights up.

Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related to the
issues discussed in this chapter. Any movement
of the camera or subject can also cause blur.
Both of these problems are actually related to
shutter speed, an exposure control that I cover
in Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 7,
which provides some additional tips for captur-
ing moving objects without blur.

136
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Adjusting Autofocus Performance
You can adjust two aspects of your Rebel XTi/400D’s autofocusing system:
the active autofocus point and the AF (autofocus) mode. The next two 
sections explain these features.
Selecting an autofocus point
When you shoot in any of the fully automatic exposure modes (Full Auto,
Portrait, Landscape, and so on) as well as in A-DEP mode, all nine of your
camera’s autofocus points are active. That means that the camera’s auto-
focusing system looks at all the points when trying to establish focus.
Typically, the camera sets focus on the point that falls over the object closest
to the lens. If that focusing decision doesn’t suit your needs, you have two
options:
 Focus manually.
 Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, or M exposure mode. In those modes, you
can tell the camera to base focus on a specific autofocus point.
Chapter 1 explains how to adjust focus manually. To stay in autofocus mode
and specify an autofocus point, take these steps:
1. Set the Mode dial to P,
Tv, Av, or M.
Again, you can specify an
autofocus point only in
these exposure modes. 
2. Press and release the AF
Point Selection button,
highlighted in Figure 6-3.
When you do, you see
the AF Point Selection
screen on the monitor.
The display indicates
whether the camera is
currently in Automatic
AF Point Selection mode
or Manual AF Point
Selection mode, as 
follows.
AF Point Selection button
Figure 6-3: Press and hold the AF Point Selection
button to select an autofocus point.

• Automatic AF Point Selection
mode: All the AF points
appear yellow in the moni-
tor, as shown in Figure 6-4.
• Manual AF Point Selection:
Only one of the nine auto-
focus points is selected 
and appears yellow, as
shown in Figure 6-5.
You can check the current mode
by looking through the view-
finder, too. When you press and
release the AF Point Selection
button, all nine autofocus points
turn red if you’re in Automatic 
AF Point Selection mode. A single
point turns red if you’re in Manual
AF Point Selection mode.
3. Set the camera to Manual AF
Point Selection mode if needed.
You can do this in two ways:
• Rotate the Main dial. This
option is easiest when your
eye is up to the viewfinder.
• Press the Set button. Pressing
the button toggles you
between Automatic AF
Point Selection and Manual
AF Point Selection with the
center point activated.
4. Specify which AF Point you want to use.
Here again, you have two options:
• Rotate the Main dial. Rotating the dial cycles through the nine
points and then back to Automatic AF Point Selection mode.
• Press the cross keys. Just press the up, down, left, or right keys to
highlight the point you want to use. In this case, cycling through 
all the options doesn’t switch you back to Automatic mode.
That’s all there is to it — after you select the autofocus point, just frame your
shot so that your subject falls under than point and then press the shutter
button halfway to focus.

Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Figure 6-4: In Automatic mode, all nine auto-
focus points are active.
Figure 6-5: You also can base autofocus on a
single point.

138
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If you want the benefits of autofocus but find it bothersome to have to worry
about selecting an autofocus point, try this approach: Set the camera to
Manual AF Point Selection and select the center point as the active point.
Remember, you can do this easily by just pressing the Set button in Step 2.
Now the camera will always set focus based on whatever is at the center 
of the frame — a setup that, in my opinion, is the most intuitive way to do
things. If you want your subject to appear off-center, you still can: Just frame
the picture initially so that the subject is centered, depress the shutter button
halfway to establish, and then reframe the image before pressing the shutter
button the rest of the way. 
Do be careful about exposure if you use this technique, however. If the expo-
sure metering mode is set to either Partial or Center-Weighted Average meter-
ing, and you reframe the image so that your subject isn’t at the center of the
frame, exposure may be off. To compensate, you may need to lock exposure
(using the AE Lock button) before you reframe. In Evaluative metering mode,
this issue shouldn’t be a big problem because exposure is based on the entire
frame. Chapter 5 provides details about metering modes, exposure lock, and
other exposure issues. 
Changing the AF (autofocus) mode
Your camera offers three different autofocusing schemes, which you select
through a control called AF mode. The three choices work like so:
 One-Shot: In this mode, which is geared to shooting stationary subjects,
the camera locks focus when you depress the shutter button halfway.
Focus remains locked as long as you hold the shutter button at that
halfway position.
 AI Servo: In this mode, the camera adjusts focus continually as needed
from the time you press the shutter button halfway to the time you take
the picture. This mode is designed to make it easier to focus on moving
objects.
For AI Servo to work properly, you must reframe as needed to keep your
subject under the active autofocus point if you’re working in Manual AF
Point Selection mode. If the camera is set to Automatic AF Point Selection,
keep the subject within the diamond-shape area covered by the nine 
autofocus points. (The preceding section explains these two modes.)
In either case, the green focus dot in the viewfinder blinks rapidly if the
camera isn’t tracking focus successfully. If all is going well, the focus dot
does not light up at all.
 AI Focus: This mode automatically switches the camera from One-Shot
to AI Servo as needed. When you first press the shutter button halfway,
focus is locked on the active autofocus point (or points), as usual in
One-Shot mode. But if the subject moves, the camera shifts into AI Servo
mode and adjusts focus as it thinks is warranted.

Which of these three modes are available to you, however, depends on the
exposure mode, as follows:
 In P, Tv, Av, and M modes, you can select any of the three Focus mode
options.
 In A-DEP mode as well as in Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, and
Close Up modes, the camera restricts you to One-Shot mode.
 Sports mode always uses AI Servo autofocus.
 Full Auto and No Flash modes always use AI Focus.
So, assuming that you can choose from all three, which mode is best? Well,
here’s my take: One-Shot mode works best for shooting still subjects, and AI
Servo is the right choice for moving subjects. But frankly, AI Focus does a
good job in most cases of making that shift for you and saves you the trouble
of having to change the mode each time you go from shooting still to moving
subjects. So, in my mind, there’s no real reason to fiddle with the setting
unless you’re shooting moving objects and want to be able to lock focus at a
specific position — in which case, my recommendation would be to simply
switch to manual focusing anyway.
Whatever you decide, you can set the
Focus mode as follows:
1. Press the right cross key (the
one labeled AF).
The monitor shows the screen
you see in Figure 6-6.
2. Press the left or right cross keys
or rotate the Main dial to high-
light your choice.
3. Press the Set button.
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept of depth of field is one of the biggest steps
you can take to becoming a more artful photographer. I introduce you to
depth of field in Chapters 2 and 5, but here’s a quick recap just to hammer
home the lesson:
 Depth of field refers to the distance over which objects in a photograph
appear sharply focused.
139
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Figure 6-6: Press the right cross key to change
the AF mode.

140
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 With a shallow, or small, depth of field, only your subject and objects
very close to it appear sharp. Objects at a distance from the subject
appear blurry.
 With a large depth of field, the zone of sharp focus extends to include
distant objects.
Which arrangement works best depends entirely on your creative vision and
your subject. In portraits, for example, a classic technique is to use a short
depth of field, as I did for the photo in Figure 6-7. This approach increases
emphasis on the subject while diminishing the impact of the background. But
for the photo shown in Figure 6-8, I wanted the historical marker, the light-
house, and the cottage behind to have equal weight in the scene, so I used
settings that produced a large depth of field, keeping them all in sharp focus.
Figure 6-7: A shallow depth of field blurs the background 
and draws added attention to the subject.
Shallow depth of field

Note, though, that with a short depth
of field, you can just as easily throw
foreground objects into soft focus 
as background objects. In the light-
house scene, for example, if I had
used settings that produced a short
depth of field, and I set focus on the
lighthouse, the historical marker and
the cottage both might be outside the
zone of sharp focus.
So how do you adjust depth of field?
You have three points of control:
aperture, focal length, and camera-
to-subject distance, as spelled out in
the following list:
 Aperture setting (f-stop): The
aperture is one of three expo-
sure settings, all explained fully
in Chapter 5. Depth of field
increases as you stop down the
aperture (by choosing a higher 
f-stop number). For shallow
depth of field, open the aperture
(by choosing a lower f-stop
number).
Figure 6-9 offers an example.
Notice that the trees in the 
background are much more softly focused in the f/5.6 example than in
the f/11 version. I snapped both images using the same focal length and
camera-to-subject distance, so aperture is the only depth-of-field vari-
able between the two images. 
Of course, changing the aperture requires adjusting the shutter speed or
ISO to maintain the equivalent exposure; for these images, I adjusted
shutter speed only.
 Lens focal length: In lay terms, focal length determines what the lens
“sees.” As you increase focal length, measured in millimeters, the angle
of view narrows, objects appear larger in the frame, and — the impor-
tant point for this discussion — depth of field decreases. Additionally,
the spatial relationship of objects changes as you adjust focal length.
As an example, Figure 6-10 compares the same scene shot at focal
lengths of 138mm and 255mm. I used the same aperture, f/22, for both
examples.
141
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Large depth of field
Figure 6-8: A large depth of field keeps both
near and far subjects in sharp focus.

142
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 6-9: Raising the f-stop value increases depth of field.
Whether you have any focal length flexibility depends on your lens: If
you have a zoom lens, you can adjust the focal length — just zoom in 
or out. (The Rebel XTi/400D kit lens, for example, offers a focal range of
18–55mm.) If you don’t have a zoom lens, the focal length is fixed, so
scratch this means of manipulating depth of field.
For more technical details about focal length and your camera, see the
sidebar “Fun facts about focal length.”
 Camera-to-subject distance: As you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do,
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-11
and summed up in the following list:
f/5.6, 1/1000 second
f/11, 1/200 second

 To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide as
possible (select the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum
focal length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.
 To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the
highest possible f-stop setting, zoom out to the shortest focal length
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.
Figure 6-10: Zooming to a longer focal length also reduces depth of field.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
 When depth of field is a primary concern, try using aperture-priority
autoexposure (Av). In this mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the
f-stop, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce
a good exposure. The range of aperture settings you can access depends
on your lens.
 Some of the fully automatic scene modes are also designed with depth of
field in mind. Portrait and Close-Up modes produce shortened depth 
of field; Landscape mode produces a greater depth of field. You can’t
adjust aperture in these modes, however, so you’re limited to the setting
the camera chooses.

255mm, f/22

Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 6-11: Aperture, focal length, and your shooting distance determine depth 
of field.
 The Rebel XTi/400D also offers a special autoexposure mode called A-
DEP, which stands for automatic depth of field. In this mode, the camera
selects the aperture setting that it thinks will keep all objects in the
frame within the zone of sharp focus. You can read more about this
mode in the next section.
 Not sure which aperture setting you need to produce the depth of field
you want? Good news: You camera offers depth-of-field preview, which
enables you to see in advance how the aperture affects the focus zone.
See the section labeled “Checking depth of field” for details on how to
use this feature.
 The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust depth of field
also is affected by the distance between the subject and the background.
For increased background blurring, move the subject farther in front of
the background.
 If you adjust aperture to affect depth of field, be sure to always keep an
eye on shutter speed as well. To maintain the same exposure, shutter
speed must change in tandem with aperture, and you may encounter a
situation where the shutter speed is too slow to permit hand-holding of
the camera. Lenses that offer optical image stabilization do enable most
people to handhold the camera at slower shutter speeds than non-
stabilized lenses, but double-check your results just to be sure. (Note
that if you use a tripod, most lens manufacturers recommend that 
you turn off the stabilization feature; check your manual to be sure.)
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject

Using A-DEP mode
In addition to the four advanced exposure
modes found on most digital SLR cameras,
your Rebel XTi/400D offers a fifth mode
called A-DEP, as shown in Figure 6-12. The
initials stand for automatic depth of field.
This mode is designed to assist you in pro-
ducing photos that have a depth of field
sufficient to keep all objects in the frame 
in sharp focus. The camera accomplishes
this by analyzing the lens-to-subject dis-
tance for all those objects and then select-
ing the aperture that results in the
appropriate depth of field. After choosing
the aperture, the camera then selects the necessary shutter speed to properly
expose the image at the selected f-stop.
A-DEP mode isn’t a surefire bet, however, and it does have some restrictions
that may make it unsuitable for your subject. Here’s what you need to know:
 In very dim lighting, the shutter speed the camera selects may be too
slow to allow you to handhold the camera. So check the shutter speed 
in the viewfinder after you press the shutter button halfway to meter
and focus the image. If the speed is lower than about 1/50 second, use a
tripod. (If you’re using a long lens, you’ll need a tripod even at faster
shutter speeds.)
145
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Fun facts about focal length
Every lens can be characterized by its focal
length, or in the case of a zoom lens, the range
of focal lengths it offers. Measured in millime-
ters, focal length determines the camera’s angle
of view, the apparent size and distance of
objects in the scene, and depth of field.
According to photography tradition, a focal
length of 50mm is described as a “normal” lens.
Most point-and-shoot cameras feature this
focal length, which is a medium-range lens that
works well for the type of snapshots that users
of those kinds of cameras are likely to shoot.
A lens with a focal length under 35mm is char-
acterized as a wide-angle lens because at that
focal length, the camera has a wide angle of
view and produces a long depth of field, making
it good for landscape photography. A short focal
length also has the effect of making objects
seem smaller and farther away. At the other end
of the spectrum, a lens with a focal length
longer than 80mm is considered a telephoto
lens and often referred to as a long lens. With a
long lens, angle of view narrows, depth of field
decreases, and faraway subjects appear closer
Figure 6-12: A-DEP stands for automatic
depth of field.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 If the aperture value blinks in the viewfinder, the camera can’t set the 
f-stop so that you get both a good exposure and the depth of field neces-
sary to keep all objects in the frame in sharp focus. In this situation, the
camera assumes that your primary goal is a good exposure and so
adjusts the aperture as needed based on the available light.
and larger, which is ideal for wildlife and sports
photographers.
Note, however, that the focal lengths stated
here and elsewhere in the book are so-called
35mm equivalent focal lengths. Here’s the deal:
For reasons that aren’t really important, when
you put a standard lens on most digital cameras,
including your Rebel XTi/400D, the available
frame area is reduced, as if you took a picture
on a camera that uses 35mm film negatives (the
kind you’ve probably been using for years) and
then cropped it.
This so-called crop factor, sometimes also called
the magnification factor, varies depending on the
digital camera, which is why the photo industry
adopted the 35mm-equivalent measuring stick as
a standard. With your camera, the cropping
factor is roughly 1.6. So the 18–55mm kit lens sold
with the Rebel XTi/400D, for example, actually
captures the approximate area you would get
from a 27–82mm lens on a 35mm film camera. In
the figure here, for example, the red outline indi-
cates the image area that results from the 1.6
crop factor.
Note that although the area the lens can cap-
ture changes when you move a lens from a
35mm film camera to a digital body, depth of
field isn’t affected, nor are the spatial relation-
ships between objects in the frame. So when
lens shopping, you gauge those two character-
istics of the lens by looking at the stated focal
length — no digital-to-film conversion math is
required.

(continued)

 If the shutter speed blinks in the viewfinder, the light is either too bright
or too dim for the camera to properly expose the image at any combina-
tion of aperture and shutter speed. In bright light, you can lower the ISO,
if it isn’t already at 100, or reposition or shade your subject. In dim light-
ing, raise the ISO or add artificial light.
 You can use flash with A-DEP mode, but the minute you turn on the
flash, the camera no longer does its automatic depth-of-field calculation.
Instead, it presents you with a fixed combination of aperture and shutter
speed that will properly expose the image. The depth of field may or
may not be what you want.
Given these limitations, my personal recommendation is that as soon as you
fully understand the impact of aperture on depth of field, you politely decline
the option of using A-DEP mode and instead work in aperture-priority autoex-
posure mode (Av) instead. Then you can simply match the f-stop to the depth
of field you have in mind, without giving up the option of using flash.
Checking depth of field
When you look through your
viewfinder and press the shut-
ter button halfway, you can
get only a partial indication 
of the depth of field that your
current camera settings will
produce. You can see the
effect of focal length and the
camera-to-subject distance,
but because the aperture
doesn’t actually open to your
selected f-stop until you take
the picture, the viewfinder
doesn’t show you how that
setting will affect depth of
field.
By using the depth of field
preview button on your
camera, however, you can 
do just that. Almost hidden
away on the front of your
camera, just below the lens-
release button, the Depth-of-
Field Preview button is the
tiny, unmarked silver button shown in Figure 6-13.

148
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
To use this feature, just press and hold the shutter button halfway down and
then press and hold the Depth-of-Field Preview button with the other hand.
You’ll hear a little whirring noise, and the scene in the viewfinder may get
either brighter or darker, depending on the f-stop. After the preview engages,
you can release the shutter button and then rotate the Main dial to see how
changing the f-stop affects the depth of field. (The exception is when the
camera is set to A-DEP mode, in which you have no control over aperture.) 
Note that the preview doesn’t engage in P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP mode if your cur-
rent aperture and shutter speed aren’t adequate to expose the image prop-
erly. You have to solve the exposure issue before you can use the preview.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding some aspects of digital photography — 
resolution, aperture and shutter speed, depth of field, and so on — making
sense of your camera’s color options is easy-breezy. First, color problems
aren’t all that common, and when they are, they’re usually simple to fix with 
a quick shift of your camera’s white balance control. And getting a grip on
color requires learning only a couple of new terms, an unusual state of affairs
for an endeavor that often seems more like high-tech science than art.
The rest of this chapter explains the aforementioned white balance control,
plus a couple of menu options that enable you to fine-tune the way your
camera renders colors. For information on how to alter colors of existing pic-
tures by using the software that shipped with your camera, see Chapter 10.
Correcting colors with white balance
Every light source emits a particular color cast. The old-fashioned fluores-
cent lights found in most public restrooms, for example, put out a bluish-
greenish light, which is why our reflections in the mirrors in those restrooms
always look so sickly. And if you think that your beloved looks especially
attractive by candlelight, you aren’t imagining things: Candlelight casts a
warm, yellow-red glow that is flattering to the skin.
Science-y types measure the color of light, officially known as color tempera-
ture, on the Kelvin scale, which is named after its creator. You can see the
Kelvin scale in Figure 6-14.
When photographers talk about “warm light” and “cool light,” though, they
aren’t referring to the position on the Kelvin scale — or at least not in the
way we usually think of temperatures, with a higher number meaning hotter.
Instead, the terms describe the visual appearance of the light. Warm light,
produced by candles and incandescent lights, falls in the red-yellow spectrum

you see at the bottom of the Kelvin scale in
Figure 6-14; cool light, in the blue-green spec-
trum, appears at the top of the scale. 
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these fluc-
tuating colors of light because our eyes auto-
matically compensate for them. Except in very
extreme lighting conditions, a white tablecloth
appears white to us no matter whether we view
it by candlelight, fluorescent light, or regular
houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for 
different colors of light through a feature
known as white balancing. Simply put, white
balancing neutralizes light so that whites are
always white, which in turn ensures that other
colors are rendered accurately. If the camera
senses warm light, it shifts colors slightly to
the cool side of the color spectrum; in cool
light, the camera shifts colors the opposite
direction.
The good news is that, as with your eyes, your camera’s automatic white bal-
ance setting, which carries the label AWB, tackles this process remarkably
well in most situations, which means that you can usually ignore it and con-
centrate on other aspects of your picture. But if your scene is lit by two or
more light sources that cast different colors, the white balance sensor can
get confused, producing an unwanted color cast like the one you see in the
left image in Figure 6-15.
I shot this product image in my home studio, which I light primarily with a
couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten bulbs, which produce
light with a color temperature similar to regular household incandescent
bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also permit some pretty
strong daylight to filter through. In automatic white balance mode, the camera
reacted to that daylight — which has a cool color cast — and applied too
much warming, giving my original image a yellow tint. No problem: I just
switched the white balance mode from AWB to the Tungsten Light setting.
The right image in Figure 6-15 shows the corrected colors.
There’s one little problem with white balancing as it’s implemented on your
Rebel XTi/400D, though. You can’t make this kind of manual white balance
selection if you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes. So if you spy
color problems in your camera monitor, you need to switch to either P, Tv,
Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode. (Chapter 5 details all five modes).

(left); switching to the Tungsten Light setting solved the problem (right).
The next section explains precisely how to make a simple white balance cor-
rection; following that, you can explore some advanced white balance features.
Changing the white balance setting
To switch from automatic to manual white balancing, follow these steps:
1. Set the camera Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
You can tweak white balance only in these advanced exposure modes.
2. Press the WB key (the bottom cross key).
You see the White Balance screen, shown on the left in Figure 6-16.
3. Press the right or left cross key or rotate the Main dial to highlight the
setting you want to use.
As you scroll through the list of options, the name of the selected setting
appears above the little icon. For some settings, the camera also dis-
plays the approximate Kelvin temperature of the light source that the
setting matches. (Refer to Figure 6-14 for a look at the Kelvin scale.)

If the scene is lit by several light sources, choose the setting that corre-
sponds to the strongest source. The Tungsten Light setting is usually
best for regular incandescent household bulbs, by the way. And with the
Custom option, you can define your own white-balance setting; see the
next section for details.
4. Press Set to lock in your choice.
You can confirm the current white balance setting by displaying the Camera
Settings screen. The white balance icon appears in the area highlighted in the
right image in Figure 6-16. Table 6-1 offers a reminder of what setting each
icon represents.
Figure 6-16: Press the bottom cross key (WB) to access white balance options.
Your selected white balance setting remains in force for the P, Tv, Av, M, and
A-DEP exposure modes until you change it again. So you may want to get in
the habit of resetting the option to AWB (automatic white balance) after you
finish shooting whatever subject it was that caused you to switch to manual
white balance mode.

Creating a custom white balance setting
If none of the preset white balance options produces the right amount of
color correction, you can create your own custom setting. To use this tech-
nique, you need a piece of card stock that’s either neutral gray or absolute
white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other close-but-not perfect
white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this purpose in many
camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for
your photo. Then take these steps:
1. Set the camera to the P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
You can’t create a custom setting in any of the fully automatic modes.
2. Set the camera to manual focusing and then focus on your reference
card.
Chapter 1 has details on manual focusing if you need help.
3. Frame the shot so that your reference card fills the center area of the
viewfinder.
In other words, make sure that at least the center autofocus point and
the six surrounding points fall over the reference card.
4. Make sure that the exposure settings are correct.
Just press the shutter button halfway to check exposure. In M mode, make
sure that the exposure indicator is at the midway point of the exposure
meter. In other modes, a blinking aperture or shutter speed value 

indicates an exposure problem. If necessary, adjust ISO, aperture, or shut-
ter speed to fix the problem; Chapter 5 explains how.
5. Take the picture of your reference card.
The camera will use this picture to establish your custom white balance
setting.
6. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Custom WB, as shown on the
left in Figure 6-17.
7. Press Set.
Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-17. The image you
just captured should appear in the display. (If not, press the right or left
cross key or rotate the Main dial to scroll to the image.)
Figure 6-17: You can create a custom white balance setting through Shooting Menu 2. 
8. Press Set.
You see the message shown in
Figure 6-18. This message tells
you that the white balance setting
is now stored. The little icon in
the message area represents the
Custom white balance setting.
Your custom white balance setting
remains stored until the next time 
you work your way through these
steps. So anytime you’re shooting in
the same lighting conditions and want
to apply the same white balance cor-
rection, just press the bottom cross
key — the one labeled WB — to
access the white balance options and
then select the Custom option.

Fine-tuning white balance settings
As yet another alternative for manipulating colors, your Rebel XTi/400D
enables you to tweak white balancing in a way that shifts all colors toward a
particular part of the color spectrum. The end result is similar to applying 
a traditional color filter to your lens.
To access this option, called White Balance Correction, take these steps:
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
You can take advantage of White Balance Correction only in these modes.
2. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight WB Shift/Bkt, as shown on the
left in Figure 6-19.
Figure 6-19: White Balance Correction offers one more way to control colors.
3. Press Set to display the screen you see on the right in Figure 6-19.
The screen contains a grid that is oriented around two main color pairs:
green and magenta, represented by the G and M labels, and blue and
amber, represented by B and A. The little white square indicates the cur-
rent amount of white balance correction, or shift. When the square is
dead center in the grid, as in the figure, no shift is applied.
4. Use the cross keys to move the square marker in the direction of the
shift you want to achieve.
As you do, the Shift area of the display tells the amount of color bias
that you’ve selected. For example, in Figure 6-20, I shifted three levels
toward amber and one toward magenta.
If you’re familiar with traditional lens filters, you may know that the den-
sity of a filter, which determines the degree of color correction it pro-
vides, is measured in mireds (pronounced my-redds). The white balance
grid is designed around this system: Moving the marker one level is the
equivalent of adding a filter with a density of 5 mireds.

5. Press Set to apply the change
and return to the menu.
After you apply white balance
correction, a little plus or minus
sign appears next to the white
balance symbol in the Camera
Settings display, as shown on the
left in Figure 6-21. That’s your
reminder that white balance shift
is being applied. The same
symbol appears in the view-
finder. You can see the exact cor-
rection values in Shooting Menu
2, as shown on the right in the
figure.
Figure 6-21: The +/- symbol lets you know that white balance shift is being applied.
Your adjustment remains in force for all the advanced exposure modes
until you change it. And the correction is applied no matter what white
balance setting you choose. So make it a point to check the monitor or
viewfinder before your next shoot — otherwise, you may forget to adjust
the white balance for the current light.
6. To cancel white balance correction, repeat these steps and just move
the grid marker back to the center position.
Be sure that values in the Shift area of the display are both set to 0. In
other words, your screen should look like what you see on the right in
Figure 6-19. 
Many film-photography enthusiasts place colored filters on their lenses to
either warm or cool their images. Portrait photographers, for example, often
add a warming filter to give skin tones a healthy, golden glow. You can mimic
the effects of such filters by simply fine-tuning your camera’s white balance

settings as just described. Experiment with shifting the white balance a tad
toward amber and magenta for a warming effect or toward blue and green for
a cooling effect.
Bracketing shots with white balance
Chapter 5 introduces you to your camera’s automatic exposure bracketing,
which enables you to easily record the same image at three different expo-
sure settings. Similarly, you can take advantage of automatic white balance
bracketing. With this feature, the camera records the same image three times,
using a slightly different white balance setting for each.
This feature is especially helpful when you’re shooting in varying light
sources — for example, a mix of fluorescent light, daylight, and flash.
Bracketing the shots ups the odds that the color renditions of at least 
one of the shots will be to your liking.
Note a couple of things about this feature:
 You can’t use white balance bracketing if you set the camera’s Quality
setting to either Raw or Raw+Large/Fine. And frankly, there isn’t any
need to do so in Raw mode because you can precisely tune colors when
you process the Raw files. Chapter 8 has details on Raw processing. 
 Because the camera records three images, white balance bracketing
reduces the maximum capture speed that is possible when you use the
Continuous shooting mode. See Chapter 2 for more about Continuous
mode. Of course, recording three images instead of one also eats up
more space on your memory card.
 The white balance bracketing feature is designed around the same grid
used for white balance correction, explained in the preceding section. 
As a reminder, the grid is based on two color pairs: green/magenta and
blue/amber.
 When white balance bracketing is enabled, the camera always records
the first of the three bracketed shots using a neutral white balance set-
ting — or, at least, what it considers to be neutral, given its own mea-
surement of the light. The second and third shots are then recorded
using the specified shift along either the green/magenta or blue/amber
axis of the color grid.
If all that is as clear as mud, just take a look at Figure 6-22 for an example. I
captured these images using a single tungsten studio light and the candle
light itself. I set up white balance bracketing to work along the blue/amber
color axis. So the camera recorded the first image at neutral, the second with
a slightly blue color bias, and the third, with an amber bias.

Figure 6-22: I captured one neutral image, one with a blue bias, and one with an amber bias.
To enable white balance bracketing, take these steps:
1. Make sure the Quality option is not set to record Raw images.
You find this setting on Shooting Menu 1. If you select Raw (or
Raw+Large/Fine), the camera simply records each image the same way.
You then can adjust colors in your Raw processor.
2. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight WB/Shift Bkt.
3. Press Set to display the grid
shown in Figure 6-23.
The screen is the same one you
see when you use the White
Balance Correction feature,
explained in the preceding 
section.
4. Use the cross keys and Main
dial to set the amount and
direction of the bracketing
shift.
First, press the cross keys to
position the white balance
marker — that’s the little white

square — in the grid. Then rotate the Main dial to specify whether you
want the bracketing to be applied across the horizontal axis (blue to
amber) or the vertical axis (green to magenta.)
• Blue to amber bracketing: Rotate the dial right.
• Green to magenta bracketing: Rotate the dial left. 
As you rotate the dial, three markers appear on the grid, indicating the
amount of shift that will be applied to your trio of bracketed images. You
can apply a maximum shift of plus or minus three levels of adjustment.
The BKT area of the screen also indicates the shift; for example, in
Figure 6-23, the display shows a bracketing amount of plus and minus
three levels on the blue/amber
axis. I used the settings shown
in Figure 6-23 to record the
example images you see in
Figure 6-22. As you can see,
even at the maximum shift 
(+/– 3), the difference to the
colors is subtle.
5. Press Set to apply your
changes and return to the
menu.
The bracketing symbol shown 
in Figure 6-24 appears in the
Camera Settings display. Your
bracketing setting remains 
in effect until you turn the
camera off.
Choosing a Color Space: sRGB vs. Adobe RGB
Normally, your camera captures images using the sRGB color mode, which
simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of colors. (The s is for stan-
dard, and the RGB is for red-green-blue, which are the primary colors in the
digital imaging color world.) This color mode was created to help ensure
color consistency as an image moves from camera (or scanner) to monitor
and printer; the idea was to create a spectrum of colors that all these devices
can reproduce.
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be repro-
duced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an alternative,
your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB color mode, which
includes a larger spectrum (or gamut) of colors. Figure 6-25 offers an illustra-
tion of the two spectrums.
White balance bracketing icon
Figure 6-24: This symbol indicates that bracket-
ing is being applied.

Figure 6-25: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the 
sRGB spectrum.
Some colors in the Adobe RGB spec-
trum cannot be reproduced in print.
Still, I usually shoot in Adobe RGB
mode because I see no reason to
limit myself to a smaller spectrum
from the get-go.
If you want to capture images in
Adobe RGB instead of sRGB, visit
Shooting Menu 2, highlight the Color
Space option, and press Set. Now you
see the screen shown in Figure 6-26.
Use the up or down cross key to
highlight Adobe RGB and press Set
again.
Remember that this color mode choice applies only when you shoot in the
advanced exposure modes: P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. In all other modes, 
the camera automatically selects sRGB as the color space.

Exploring Picture Styles
In addition to all the focus and color features already covered in this chapter,
your Rebel XTi/400D offers Picture Styles. Through Picture Styles, you can 
further tweak color, saturation, contrast, and image sharpening.
Sharpening, in case you’re new to the digital meaning of the term, refers to a
software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates the illusion of
slightly sharper focus. I explain sharpening fully in Chapter 10, but the impor-
tant thing to note for now is that sharpening cannot remedy poor focus, but
instead produces a subtle tweak to this aspect of your pictures.
In fact, many of the adjustments that Picture Styles apply are pretty subtle, at
least to my eye. The impact of any of these settings varies depending on your
subject, but on the whole, if you want to make large-scale changes to color,
contrast, or sharpening, you’re probably going to need to use your computer
and photo editing software.
Again, though, your mileage may vary, as they say, as may your opinion of
what constitutes the optimum color and sharpening characteristics. So I
leave it to you to do your own testing and decide for yourself which of the
Picture Style settings you prefer for your photographs. (Inspect your test
shots on your computer monitor, where the differences produced by the 
various Picture Style settings are easier to spot than on the camera monitor
or on these pages.)
The next section explains how to apply one of the six prefab Picture Styles
your camera provides. Later sections explain how to customize those five
Picture Styles and also how to define your very own, custom Picture Styles.
Selecting a Picture Style
When you set the Mode dial to Full Auto or any of the other fully automatic
exposure modes, the camera selects a Picture Style for you. In P, Tv, Av, M,
and A-DEP modes, however, you can specify which of the Picture Styles you
want to use.
You can access Picture Styles through Shooting Menu 2, as shown on the left
in Figure 6-27. Just highlight the Picture Styles option and press Set to display
the screenful of options you see on the right in the figure. (You can see only
five of the Picture Style settings on the first screen; scroll down using the
cross keys to view the others.)

Figure 6-27: You can access Picture Styles options via Shooting Menu 2.
For an even quicker option, though,
just press the Set button while no
menus are displayed. In that case, you
see the screen shown in Figure 6-28.
Here, all the available Picture Styles
are visible.
Either way, highlight the style you
want to use by pressing the cross 
keys or rotating the Main dial and 
then press Set again. The selected
Picture Style is applied until you
change the setting again.
Here’s a description of each Picture
Style option:
 Standard: The default setting, this option captures the image normally —
that is, using the characteristics that Canon offers as suitable for the
majority of subjects. 
 Portrait: This mode reduces sharpening slightly from the amount that’s
applied in Standard mode, with the goal of keeping skin texture soft.
Color saturation, on the other hand, is slightly increased. 
The Canon manual recommends this setting for portraits of women and
children — presuming, I guess, that men prefer not to be rendered with
slightly soft skin. But I suggest that it’s appropriate for portraits regard-
less of gender or age. 
If you shoot in the Portrait exposure mode, the camera automatically
applies this Picture Style for you.
161
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Figure 6-28: Press the Set button with no
menus displayed to quickly select a Picture
Style.

162
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 Landscape: In a nod to traditions of landscape photography, this Picture
Style emphasizes greens and blues and amps up color saturation and
sharpness, resulting in bolder images.
The camera automatically applies this Picture Style if you set the Mode
dial to the Landscape exposure mode.
 Neutral: This setting reduces saturation and contrast slightly compared
to how the camera renders images when the Standard option is selected. 
 Faithful: The Faithful style is designed to render colors as closely as
possible to how your eye perceives them.
 Monochrome: This setting produces, er, black-and-white photos. Only in
the digital world, they’re called grayscale images because a true black-
and-white image contains only black and white, with no shades of gray.
Note that when this Picture Style is selected, the initials B/W appear on
the Camera Settings display.
If you set the Quality option on Shooting Menu 1 to Raw (or Raw +
Large/Fine), the camera displays your image on the monitor in black and
white during playback. But during the Raw converter process, you can
either choose to go with your grayscale version or view and save a full-
color version. Or, even better, you can process and save the image once
as a grayscale photo and then process and save it again as a color
image.
If you don’t capture the image in the Raw format, you can’t access the
original image colors later. 
 User Defined 1, 2, and 3: These options enables you to create and save
three of your own Picture Styles. I cover this feature in the last section 
of the chapter.
Figure 6-29 shows you how the camera rendered the same scene in each of
the six preset Picture Styles. As you can see, Landscape has the most notice-
able impact. To my taste, in fact, Landscape colors are a little over the top,
but that’s strictly a personal preference.
If you don’t like any of the Picture Styles, you can use the options discussed
in the next section to tweak them.
Customizing Picture Styles
You can customize the results that you get from the prefab Picture Styles. For
the Standard, Landscape, Portrait, Neutral, and Faithful styles, you can adjust
sharpness, contrast, saturation, and color tone.
I’m guessing that the first three effects — sharpness, contrast, and saturation —
are self-explanatory. But the color tone option may not be so obvious. This
option, which is designed to help you tweak skin colors, enables you to make
your colors either a little more red or a little more yellow.

Figure 6-29: Each Picture Style produces a slightly different take on the image.
For the Monochrome Picture Style, saturation and color tone are irrelevant,
so they are replaced by two other options, Filter and Toning Effect. The Filter
effect options mimic color filters sometimes used by photographers shooting
black-and-white film. The color of the filter determines which colors in the
original scene become prominent in the black-and-white image. The Toning
Effect options enable you to apply a sepia, blue, purple, or green tint to your
monochrome image.

To dig into Picture Style customizing, take these steps:
1. Display Shooting Menu 2, highlight Picture Style, and press Set.
You see the screen shown on the left in Figure 6-30.
Figure 6-30: You can customize the prefab Picture Styles.
2. Press the up or down cross key or rotate the Main dial to highlight the
Picture Style you want to adjust.
3. Press the Jump button.
Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-30, listing the four
characteristics that you can adjust for your selected Picture Style. Again,
if you selected the Monochrome style (not shown in the figure), you see
Filter and Toning Effect options instead of Saturation and Color Tone.
4. Highlight the characteristic that you want to tweak and press Set.
The little scale next to the selection option becomes active.
5. Press the right or left cross key or rotate the Main dial to adjust the
setting.
As soon as you adjust the setting, you see two markers: The gray one
shows you the default setting; the blue one, your customized setting.
For contrast, saturation, and sharpness, move the little marker on the
scale to the right to increase the effect. For color tone, move the slider
toward the minus sign to make colors less yellow and more red; move
the slider toward the plus sign to make colors less red and more yellow.
When you adjust the Filter and Toning Effect options for the
Monochrome style, the adjustment scale and slider are replaced by a
simple list of options; just highlight the one you want to use.
6. Press Set to lock in your adjustment.
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 to adjust the other settings as desired.

8. Press the Menu button to return to the main Picture Styles screen.
9. Press Set.
If you later want to return to the default settings for the Picture Style, just
repeat Steps 1 through 3 and then highlight Default Set (at the bottom of the
screen) in Step 4 and press Set.
Unfortunately, you can’t preview how your adjustments will affect your image
because the Picture Style attributes are applied to the photo after you shoot
it, during the time the image is recorded to your memory card. So I’d like to
offer another alternative: If you shoot in the Raw format, you don’t have to
worry about in-camera adjustments to Picture Styles — or even selecting a
Picture Style, for that matter — because you can apply the style when you
process your Raw images. Just follow the directions laid out in Chapter 8 to
use the Raw converter provided in ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or Image-
Browser (Mac). On the Image Quality Adjustment panel, shown in Figure 6-31,
you can select a Picture Style and then make the same adjustments to the
style as you can in the camera.
The Raw converter method of applying Picture Styles is perhaps most benefi-
cial for creating monochrome images — unless you’re schooled in black-and-
white photography, it can be difficult to predict which of the Monochrome
settings will best translate your colors into a grayscale image. (Note that the
Raw processor refers to the Monochrome Picture Style as B/W, as shown in
Figure 6-31.)
At the very least, experimenting with Picture Styles in the Raw converter
should help you know what adjustments you may want to make to the actual
camera settings. And for creating monochrome images, using the Raw con-
verter tools enables you to experiment with all the different Filter and Toning
Effects options to find the one you like best.
Creating your own Picture Style
The User Defined option on the Picture Style menu enables you to create and
store up to three of your very own Picture Styles. So if you hit upon a combi-
nation of customized settings that you really like for a particular type of sub-
ject — snow scenes, for example, or pictures of your pooch — you can easily
reuse those settings.
Follow these steps to create your custom Picture Style:
1. Display Shooting Menu 2, highlight Picture Style, and press Set.
You see the normal list of Picture Styles, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-32.

choose Monochrome. Your new style will be based on the one you select.
5. Set the rest of the style attributes.
The options available are the same as when you customize a style.
Highlight the option, press Set to activate the little slider, and then use
the cross keys or Main dial to adjust the setting. See the preceding sec-
tion for details about the options. Press Set again to lock in the adjust-
ment.
6. Press Menu to store your custom style.
To use your style, just select it from the Picture Style menu as usual. Note
that when you view Picture Styles in Shooting Menu 2, you see the name of
the base style you selected in Step 4 along with the User Defined 1, 2, or 3
item.

arlier chapters of this book break down each and every picture-taking
feature on your Rebel XTi/400D, describing in detail how the various con-
trols affect exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This chapter
pulls all that information together to help you set up your camera for specific
types of photography.
The first few pages offer a quick summary of critical picture-
taking settings that should serve you well no matter what
your subject. Following that, I offer my advice on which
settings to use for portraits, action shots, landscapes,
and close-ups. To wrap things up, the end of the chap-
ter includes some miscellaneous tips for dealing with
special shooting situations and subjects.
Keep in mind that although I present specific recom-
mendations here, there are no hard and fast rules as
to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a landscape, or
whatever. So don’t be afraid to wander off on your own,
tweaking this exposure setting or adjusting that focus con-

Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which settings
you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture and shutter
speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. But for a few
basic options, I recommend the same settings for almost every shooting sce-
nario. Table 7-1 lists these options as well as how you access them; Figure 7-1
offers a reminder of the buttons that are referenced in the table.
Figure 7-1: You can access several critical settings with a press of a

 Quality: This setting, introduced in Chapter 3, determines the file format
and resolution of picture file the camera creates. For best quality and
the largest possible print size, choose Large/Fine or Raw (CR2). Keep 
in mind that you must process Raw files in a raw converter; Chapter 8
explains that issue. For everyday images that you don’t plan to print
large or crop, Medium/Fine is also a good choice and creates smaller
files than the other two settings.
 White Balance: White balance compensates for the color casts produced
by different light sources. Auto white balance (AWB) mode usually does
the trick unless you’re dealing with multiple light sources; in that case,
you may need to switch to manual white balance control. Chapter 6 tells
you how. You can control this setting only in the advanced exposure
modes.
 ISO: This setting determines the light sensitivity of the camera’s image
sensor. Increasing the ISO value can create noise defects, so stick with
the lowest setting possible given the available light. You can’t select 
ISO in the fully automatic exposure modes; the camera sets the value
between 100 and 400 for you. Chapter 5 details ISO.
171
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

172
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 AF (autofocus) mode: Chapter 6 details this option, which affects the
autofocus system. In the AI Focus mode, the camera chooses the best
autofocus mode based on whether it thinks you’re shooting a still or
moving subject. (The AI stands for artificial intelligence.) In most cases,
this setting works well. You can control this option only in P, Tv, Av, and
M exposure modes.
 Drive mode: This setting enables you to shift from Single mode, in
which you record one image each time you press the shutter button, to
Continuous mode, in which the camera continues to capture images as
long as you hold down the shutter button. The third Drive mode option
puts the camera into self-timer or remote-control mode.
Single mode is the best choice in most cases, but Continuous can come
in handy for action shots, as covered later in this chapter. Chapter 2
explains all the Drive mode settings. Note that you can select self-timer
mode in all exposure modes, but you can select either Continuous or
Single only in the advanced exposure modes. In the fully automatic
modes, the camera chooses either Single or Continuous for you.
 AF Point Selection: This control enables you to choose from two auto-
focusing setups when you shoot in the P, Tv, Av, or M exposure mode. In
Automatic AF Point Selection mode, all nine of the camera’s autofocus
points are active, and the camera typically locks focus on the point that
covers the nearest object or person. In Manual AF Point Selection mode,
you can specify which of the nine autofocus points you want the camera
to use when establishing focus. The camera always uses the automatic
option when you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes or A-DEP
mode.
 Metering mode: This option determines what part of the frame the
camera analyzes when calculating exposure. Evaluative metering takes
the whole frame into account, which produces good results for most
scenes. See Chapter 5 for the scoop on the other two options, Partial
and Center-Weighted Average metering, which are selectable only when
you shoot in the advanced exposure modes. All fully automatic modes
use Evaluative metering. 
 Picture Style: When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes, you
can manipulate color, sharpness, and contrast by selecting from one of
six preset Picture Style settings or by defining your own custom style. In
the fully automatic modes, the camera selects the Picture Style for you
based on which mode you’re using. For example, in Portrait exposure
mode, the camera selects the Portrait Picture Style setting. See Chapter 6
for a review of all the Picture Style controls.
As indicated in the table, you can adjust only the Quality and Drive mode set-
tings when you shoot in the fully automatic modes. And in the A-DEP mode,
you can’t adjust the AF Point Selection or AF mode settings. If you want to
tweak all these settings, you must set the camera Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, or M.

Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed, that
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically
produce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, land-
scapes, and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along the
way — but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for
every so-called rule, there are plenty of great images that prove the exception.
Shooting still portraits
By “still portrait,” I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who
aren’t keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children,
pets, and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and
use the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the back-
ground into soft focus, as shown in the examples in this section. This artistic
choice emphasizes the subject and helps diminish the impact of any distract-
ing background objects in cases where you can’t control the setting. The fol-
lowing steps show you how to achieve this look: 
1. Set the Mode dial to Av (aperture-priority autoexposure mode) and
then select the lowest f-stop value possible.
As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop setting opens the aperture, which
shortens depth of field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low 
f-stop value is the first step in softening your portrait background. 
(The f-stop range available to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in
mind that the farther your subject is from the background, the more
background blurring you can achieve.
I recommend aperture-priority autoexposure mode when depth of field
is a primary concern because you can control the f-stop while relying 
on the camera to select the shutter speed that will properly expose the
image. Just rotate the Main dial to select your desired f-stop. But if you
aren’t comfortable with this advanced exposure mode, Portrait mode
also results in a more open aperture, although the exact f-stop setting is
out of your control. Chapter 2 details Portrait mode.
Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current aperture and
shutter speed both in the Camera Settings display, as shown on the left
in Figure 7-2, and in the viewfinder display, as shown on the right.

2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both.
As covered in Chapter 6, zooming in to a longer focal length also reduces
depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.
Avoid using a lens with a short focal length (a wide-angle lens) for por-
traits. They can cause features to appear distorted — sort of like how
people look when you view them through a security peephole in a door.
3. For indoor portraits, shoot flash-free if possible.
Shooting by available light rather than flash produces softer illumination
and avoids the problem of red-eye. To get enough light to go flash-free,
turn on room lights or, during daylight, pose your subject next to a
sunny window.
In the Av exposure mode, simply keeping the built-in flash unit closed dis-
ables the flash. In Portrait mode, unfortunately, you can’t disable the flash
if the camera thinks more light is needed. Your only option is to change
the exposure mode to No Flash, in which case the camera may or may not
choose an aperture setting that throws the background into soft focus.
If flash is unavoidable, see my list of flash tips at the end of the steps to
get better results.
4. For outdoor portraits, use a flash.
Even in bright daylight, a flash adds a beneficial pop of light to subjects’
faces, as discussed in Chapter 5 and illustrated here in Figure 7-3. 
Unfortunately, the camera doesn’t let you use flash in Portrait mode if
the light is very bright. In the Av exposure mode, just press the Flash
button on the side of the camera to enable the flash.

Figure 7-3: To properly illuminate the face in outdoor portraits, use fill flash.
Remember that in dim lighting, the camera may select a shutter speed
as slow as 1/30 second when you enable flash in Av mode, so keep an
eye on that value and use a tripod if necessary to avoid blurring from
camera shake.
5. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to lock in focus.
Make sure that an active autofocus point falls over your subject. (In the
viewfinder, active autofocus points turn red.) For best results, try to set
focus on your subject’s eyes.
Chapter 6 explains more about using autofocus, but if you have trouble,
simply set your lens to manual focus mode and then twist the focusing
ring to set focus.
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to capture the image.
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. A
few other tips can also improve your people pics:
 Before pressing the shutter button, do a quick background check.
Scan the entire frame looking for intrusive objects that may distract the
eye from the subject. If necessary, reposition the subject against a more
flattering backdrop if possible. Inside, a softly textured wall works well;
outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide nice backdrops as long as they
aren’t so ornate or colorful that they diminish the subject (for example,
a magnolia tree laden with blooms).

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 Frame the subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety of
frame sizes. Your Canon produces images that have an aspect ratio 
of 3:2. That means that your portrait perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size
but will require cropping to print at any other proportions, such as 5 x 7
or 8 x 10. Chapter 9 talks more about this issue.
 Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash and
ambient light. If you set the white balance setting to automatic (AWB),
as I recommend in Table 7-1, enabling flash tells the camera to warm
colors to compensate for the cool light of a flash. If your subject is also
lit by room lights or daylight, the result may be colors that are slightly
warmer than neutral. This warming effect typically looks nice in por-
traits, giving the skin a subtle glow. But if you aren’t happy with the
result or want even more warming, see Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-
tune white balance. Again, you can make this adjustment only in P, Tv,
Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
 When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results.
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambient
light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the pic-
ture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further reducing
the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance warning,
however.)
• Try setting the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode for nighttime and
indoor portraits. Warn your subject to expect both a preflash,
which constricts pupils, and the actual flash. See Chapter 2 for
details about using this flash mode.
• For nighttime pictures, try Night Portrait mode. In this mode, the
camera automatically selects a slower shutter speed than normal.
This enables the camera to soak up more ambient light, producing
a brighter background and reducing the flash power that’s needed
to light the subject. A slow shutter, however, means that you need
to use a tripod to avoid camera shake, which can blur the photo.
You also need to warn your subjects to remain very still during the
exposure.
• Soften the flash light by attaching a diffuser to the flash head. This
inexpensive tool both softens and spreads the light. You can see a
picture of one type of diffuser in Chapter 5. You may need to bump
up exposure slightly to compensate for the light filtering that
occurs; the camera doesn’t know that you attached the diffuser
and so doesn’t adjust the exposure on its own. In autoexposure
mode, you can use exposure compensation to adjust the image
brightness. As an alternative, you can increase the flash power
slightly. Again, Chapter 5 has details on these exposure features.
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light

bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. An
external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase worth-
while if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two portraits in
Figure 7-4 for an illustration. In the first example, the built-in flash
resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject and harsh, concen-
trated light. To produce the better result on the right, I used the
Canon Speedlite 580EX II and bounced the light off the ceiling. 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther from
the background. I took this extra step for the right image in Figure
7-4. The increased distance not only reduced shadowing but also
softened the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short depth of
field resulting from my f-stop and focal length).
A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible,
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.
Figure 7-4: To eliminate harsh lighting and strong shadows (left), I used bounce flash and 
moved the subject farther from the background (right).

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
• Study the flash information in Chapter 5, and practice before you
need to take important portraits. How the camera calculates the
aperture, shutter speed, and flash power needed to expose your
subject and background varies depending on the exposure mode
you use. So to fully understand how to get the flash results you
want, it pays to experiment with each of the advanced exposure
modes, all covered in Chapter 5.
For the maximum control over aperture, shutter speed, and flash
power, try working in Manual exposure mode and make friends
with the Flash Exposure Compensation and Flash Exposure Lock
features.
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving
subject, whether it’s a spinning Ferris wheel, a butterfly flitting from flower to
flower, or in the case of Figures 7-5 and 7-6, a hockey-playing teen. In the first
image, a shutter speed of 1/125 second was too slow to catch the subject
without blur. For this subject, who was moving at a fairly rapid speed, I needed
to bump the shutter speed all the way up to 1/1000 second to freeze the action
cleanly, as shown in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-5: A too-slow shutter speed causes the skater to appear blurry.

Figure 7-6: Raising the shutter speed to 1/1000 second “froze” the action.
Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, I use the tech-
niques in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:
1. Set the Mode dial to Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure).
In this mode, you control the shutter speed, and the camera takes care
of choosing an aperture setting that will produce a good exposure. 
If you aren’t ready to step up to this advanced exposure mode, explained
in Chapter 5, try using Sports mode, detailed in Chapter 2. But be aware
that you have no control over any other aspects of your picture (such as
white balance, flash, and so on) in that mode.
2. Rotate the Main dial to select the shutter speed.
Refer to Figure 7-7 to locate shutter speed on the Camera Settings dis-
play. After you select the shutter speed, the camera selects an aperture
(f-stop) to match.
What shutter speed you need depends on the speed at which your sub-
ject is moving, so some experimentation is needed. But generally speak-
ing, 1/500 second should be plenty for all but the fastest subjects —
speeding hockey players like my subject, race cars, boats, and so on. For
slower subjects, you can even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second.
179
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

180
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If the aperture value blinks
after you set the shutter
speed, the camera can’t
select an f-stop that will
properly expose the photo
at that shutter speed. See
Chapter 5 for more details
about how the camera noti-
fies you of potential expo-
sure problems.
3. Raise the ISO setting or
add flash to produce a
brighter exposure if
needed.
In dim lighting, you may
not be able to get a good
exposure at your chosen
shutter speed without
taking this step. Raising the ISO does increase the possibility of noise,
but a noisy shot is better than a blurry shot. The current ISO setting
appears in the top-right corner of the Camera Settings display, as shown
in Figure 7-7. (Note that in Sports mode, the camera automatically over-
rides your ISO setting if it deems necessary, but it can go only as high as
ISO 400. For more on ISO, see Chapter 5.)
Adding flash is a bit tricky for action shots, unfortunately. First, the flash
needs time to recycle between shots, so try to go without if you want 
to capture images at a fast pace. Second, the built-in flash has limited
range — so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. And
third, remember that the maximum shutter speed decreases when you
enable flash; the top speed is 1/200 second. For more on this issue,
check out the Chapter 5 sidebar related to flash synch speeds.
If you do decide to use flash, you must bail out of Sports mode, though;
it doesn’t permit you to use flash.
4. For rapid-fire shooting, set the Drive mode to Continuous.
In this mode, you can take as many as three pictures per second. The
camera continues to record images as long as the shutter button is
pressed. You can switch the Drive mode by pressing the button you see
in the margin here; the icon representing the current mode appears in
the Camera Settings display, as labeled in Figure 7-7.
If you do enable the flash, the pace at which the camera can record
images slows because the flash needs time to recycle between shots.
Chapter 2 explains more about all the Drive mode options.
5. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
You then eliminate the time the camera needs to lock focus in autofocus
mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you need help.
Shutter speed
AF mode

Figure 7-7: Changing the Drive mode to Continuous
allows rapid-fire shooting.

If you do use autofocus, try these two autofocus settings for best 
performance:
• Set the AF Point Selection mode to Automatic. Press the button
shown in the margin here to adjust this setting.
• Set the Focus mode to AI Servo (continuous-servo autofocus).
Press the right cross key to access this setting.
Chapter 6 details these autofocus options.
6. Turn off automatic image review to speed up the camera even more.
You do this via the Review Time option on the Playback menu. Turning
the option off can help speed up the time your camera needs to recover
between shots.
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
You can always crop the photo later to a tighter composition. (I did so
for my example images, which originally contained quite a bit more
background than you see in the book.) Chapter 10 shows you how to
crop pictures.
8. Lock in autofocus (if used) in advance.
Press the shutter button halfway to do so. Now when the action occurs,
just press the shutter button the rest of the way. Your image-capture
time is faster because the camera has already done the work of estab-
lishing focus.
Remember that in AI Servo mode, you must keep the subject under the
active autofocus point (or points) in order for the camera to maintain
focus. Again, Chapter 6 details this feature.
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any fast-
moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shooting
candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, leap-
ing, or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or change
positions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your eye, set
your camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots as fast 
as you can.
Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch of
countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, for
example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all build-
ings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might prefer to
shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply focused while
the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first building.
181
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

182
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
That said, I can offer a few tips to help you photograph a landscape the way
you see it:
 Shoot in aperture-priority
autoexposure mode (Av) so
that you can control depth of
field. If you want extreme depth
of field, so that both near and 
distant objects are sharply
focused, as in Figure 7-8, select
a high f-stop value. I used an
aperture of f/16 for this shot.
You can also use the Landscape
mode to achieve a large depth
of field. In this mode, the
camera automatically selects a
high f-stop number, but you
have no control over the exact
value (or any other picture-
taking settings.) Of course, if
the light is dim, the camera may
be forced to open the aperture,
reducing depth of field, to prop-
erly expose the image.
 If the exposure requires a slow
shutter, use a tripod to avoid
blurring. The downside to a
high f-stop is that you need 
a slower shutter speed to pro-
duce a good exposure. If the
shutter speed drops below
what you can comfortably hand-hold — for me, that’s about 1/50 
second — use a tripod to avoid picture-blurring camera shake. No tripod
handy? Look for any solid surface on which you can steady the camera.
You can always increase the ISO setting to increase light sensitivity, which
in turn allows a faster shutter speed, too, but that option brings with it the
chances of increased image noise. See Chapter 5 for details.
 For dramatic waterfall and fountain shots, consider using a slow shut-
ter to create that “misty” look. The slow shutter blurs the water, giving
it a soft, romantic appearance. Figure 7-9 shows you a close-up of this
effect. Again, use a tripod to ensure that the rest of the scene doesn’t
also blur due to camera shake.
 At sunrise or sunset, base exposure on the sky. The foreground will be
dark, but you can usually brighten it in a photo editor if needed. If you
base exposure on the foreground, on the other hand, the sky will

scape mode) to keep foreground and back-
ground sharply focused.

become so bright that all
the color will be washed 
out — a problem you usu-
ally can’t fix after the fact.
This tip doesn’t apply, of
course, if your sunrise or
sunset is merely serving as
a gorgeous backdrop for a
portrait. In that case, you
should enable your flash
and expose for the subject.
(See Figure 7-3, in the pre-
ceding section.)
 For cool nighttime city pics,
experiment with slow shut-
ter. Assuming that cars or
other vehicles are moving
through the scene, the
result is neon trails of light
like those you see in the
foreground of the image in
Figure 7-10, taken by my
friend Jonathan Conrad.
Shutter speed for this 
image was 8 seconds.

Figure 7-9: For misty waterfalls, use a slow shutter
speed (and tripod).

184
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Instead of changing the shutter speed manually between each shot, try
bulb mode. Available only in M (manual) exposure mode, this option
records an image for as long as you hold down the shutter button. So
just take a series of images, holding the button down for different
lengths of time for each shot. In bulb mode, you also can exceed the
minimum (slowest) shutter speed of 1/30 second. If you press the DISP
button during the exposure, the elapsed capture time appears on the
monitor. 
Because long exposures can produce image noise, you also may want 
to enable the Long Exposure Noise Reduction feature. You access this
option via the Custom Function option on Setup Menu 2; select Custom
Function 2 and change the setting from Off to Auto or On. Chapter 5 dis-
cusses this option in more detail.
 For the best lighting, shoot during the “magic hours.” That’s the term
photographers use for early morning and late afternoon, when the light
cast by the sun is soft and warm, giving everything that beautiful, gently
warmed look.
Can’t wait for the perfect light? Tweak your camera’s white balance set-
ting, using the instructions laid out in Chapter 6, to simulate magic-hour
light.
 In tricky light, bracket shots. Bracketing simply means to take the same
picture at several different exposures to increase the odds that at least
one of them will capture the scene the way you envision. Bracketing is
especially a good idea in difficult lighting situations such as sunrise and
sunset.
Your camera offers automatic exposure bracketing when you shoot in
the advanced exposure modes. See Chapter 5 to find out how to take
advantage of this feature.
 Worry about wide-angle distortion later. Shooting with a wide-angle
lens can cause vertical structures to appear to tilt either inward or out-
ward, as in Figure 7-11. You can’t do anything to avoid this problem,
known as convergence, unless you buy a very expensive lens designed
especially to avoid it.
Fortunately, many photo editing programs enable you to adjust the per-
spective of your images to straighten things out again. I used the Correct
Camera Distortion filter found in Adobe Photoshop Elements to produce
the corrected image in Figure 7-12. Note that you do lose some of your
original image area in the process, so frame your shot accordingly if you
think you will need to correct convergence later.

Figure 7-11: Converging verticals are a fact of life with most wide-angle lenses.

things out.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Capturing dynamic close-ups
For great close-up shots, start with the basic capture settings outlined in
Table 7-1. Then try the following additional settings and techniques:
 Check your owner’s manual
to find out the minimum
close-focusing distance of
your lens. How “up close 
and personal” you can get 
to your subject depends on
your lens, not the camera
body itself. 
 Take control over depth of
field by setting the camera
mode to Av (aperture-prior-
ity autoexposure) mode.
Whether you want a shallow,
medium, or extreme depth of
field depends on the point of
your photo. For the romantic
scene shown in Figure 7-13,
for example, I wanted to blur
the background to help the
subjects stand out more, so I
set the aperture to f/5.6. But
if you want the viewer to be
able to clearly see all details
throughout the frame — for
example, if you’re shooting a
product shot for your com-
pany’s sales catalog — you
need to go the other direc-
tion, stopping down the aperture as far as possible.
Not ready for the advanced exposure modes yet? Try the Close-Up scene
mode instead. (It’s the one marked with the little flower on your Mode
dial.) In this mode, the camera automatically opens the aperture to
achieve a short depth of field and bases focus on the center of the frame.
 Remember that zooming in and getting close to your subject both
decrease depth of field. So back to that product shot: If you need depth
of field beyond what you can achieve with the aperture setting, you may
need to back away, zoom out, or both. (You can always crop your image
to show just the parts of the subject that you want to feature.)
 When shooting flowers and other nature scenes outdoors, pay atten-
tion to shutter speed, too. Even a slight breeze may cause your subject
to move, causing blurring at slow shutter speeds.
 Use fill flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny
bit of flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary
Figure 7-13: Shallow depth of field helps set the
subject apart from the similarly colored background.

light source. You may need to reduce the flash output slightly, via the
camera’s Flash Exposure Compensation control. Chapter 5 offers details
about using flash.
 When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light
source. Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your flash
may be too harsh even at a low Flash Exposure Compensation setting. If
flash is inevitable, turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce the
flash power that’s needed — even a hardware-store shop light can do in a
pinch as a lighting source. (Remember that if you have multiple light
sources, though, you may need to tweak the white balance setting.)
 To really get close to your subject, invest in a macro lens or a set of
diopters. A true macro lens, which enables you to get really, really close
to your subjects, is an expensive proposition; expect to pay around $200
or more. But if you enjoy capturing the tiny details in life, it’s worth the
investment. 
For a less expensive way to go, you can spend about $40 for a set of
diopters, which are sort of like reading glasses that you screw onto your
existing lens. Diopters come in several strengths — +1, +2, + 4, and so 
on — with a higher number indicating a greater magnifying power. I took
this approach to capture the rose in Figure 7-14. The left image shows you
the closest I could get to the subject with my regular lens; to produce the
right image, I attached a +6 diopter. The downfall of diopters, sadly, is
that they typically produce images that are very soft around the edges,
as in Figure 7-14 — a problem that doesn’t occur with a good macro lens.

Coping with Special Situations
A few subjects and shooting situations pose some additional challenges not
already covered in earlier sections. So to wrap up this chapter, here’s a quick
list of ideas for tackling a variety of common “tough-shot” photos:
 Shooting through glass: To capture subjects that are behind glass, try
putting your lens flat against the glass. Then switch to manual focusing;
the glass barrier can give the autofocus mechanism fits. Disable your
flash to avoid creating any unwanted reflections, too. I used this 
technique to capture the image of the turtle sticking his neck out in
Figure 7-15.
Figure 7-15: To shoot through glass, place your lens flat against the glass.
 Shooting out a car window: Set the camera to shutter-priority autoex-
posure or manual mode and dial in a fast shutter speed to compensate
for the movement of the car. Oh, and keep a tight grip on your camera. 
 Shooting in strong backlighting: When the light behind your subject is
very strong and the lighting the subject with flash isn’t an option, you
have two choices: You can either expose the image with the subject in
mind, in which case the background will be overexposed, or you can
expose for the background, leaving the subject too dark. By taking the

latter route and purposely underexposing the subject, you can create
some nice silhouette effects. (In computerland, this is what we call
“turning a bug into a feature.”) I opted for this technique when capturing
the image in Figure 7-16, which shows a young friend standing mesmer-
ized in front of an aquarium. For indoor silhouettes like the one in the
figure, disable your flash.
 Shooting fireworks: First off, use a tripod; fireworks require a long expo-
sure, and trying to handhold your camera simply isn’t going to work. 
If using a zoom lens, zoom out to the shortest focal length. Switch to
manual focusing and set focus at infinity (the farthest focus point possi-
ble on your lens). Set the exposure mode to manual, choose a relatively
high f-stop setting — say, f/16 or so — and start a shutter speed of 1 to 3
seconds. From there, it’s simply a matter of experimenting with different
shutter speeds.
Be especially gentle when you press the shutter button — with a very
slow shutter, you can easily create enough camera movement to blur the
image. If you purchased the accessory remote control for your camera,
this is a good situation in which to use it.
You also may want to enable your camera’s noise-reduction feature
because a long exposure also increases the chances of noise defects. 
See Chapter 5 for details. (Keep the ISO setting low to further dampen
noise.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 Shooting reflective surfaces: In outdoor shots taken in bright sun, you
can reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as glass and metal by
using a circular polarizing filter, which you can buy for about $60. A
polarizing filter can also help out when you’re shooting through glass.
But know that in order for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and
your camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at a
certain angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must also
reflect off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In addition, a
polarizing filter also intensifies blue skies in some scenarios, which may
or may not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing filter isn’t a
surefire cure-all.
A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest 
in a light cube or light tent such as the ones shown in Figure 7-17, from
Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com) and Lastolite (www.lastolite.com),
respectively. You place the reflective object inside the tent or cube and
then position your lights around the outside. The cube or ten acts as a
light diffuser, reducing reflections. Prices range from about $50 to $200,
depending on size and features.

F
or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then keeping
track of all of those image files is one of the more confusing aspects
of the art form. In fact, students in my classes have more ques-
tions about this subject than just about anything else.
Frankly, writing about the download and organizing
process isn’t all that easy, either. (I know, poor me!)
The problem is that providing you with detailed
instructions is pretty much impossible because the
steps you need to take vary widely depending on
what software you have installed on your computer
and whether you use the Windows or Macintosh
operating system.
To give you as much help as possible, however, this

This chapter also covers a few other aspects of handling your picture files,
including converting pictures taken in the Raw format to a standard image
format. Finally — and perhaps most important — this chapter explains how
to ensure that your digital images stay safe after they leave the camera.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory
card to your computer:
 Connect the camera directly to the computer. For this option, you need
to dig out the USB cable that came in your camera box. Your computer
must also have a free USB slot, or port, in techie talk. If you aren’t sure
what these gadgets look like, Figure 8-1 gives you a look.
The little three-pronged icon you see on the plug and between the two
ports in Figure 8-1 is the universal symbol for USB. Be sure to check for
this symbol because a different type of slot, called a FireWire slot, looks
very similar to a USB slot, and your USB cable can even seem to fit (sort
of) into a FireWire slot. 
 Transfer images using a memory card reader. Many computers now
also have built-in memory card readers. If yours has one that accepts a
CompactFlash card, you can simply pop the card out of your camera and
into the card reader instead of hooking the camera up to the computer.
As another option, you can buy stand-alone card readers such as the
SanDisk model shown in Figure 8-2. This particular model accepts a 
variety of memory cards, including CompactFlash. Check your photo
printer, too; many printers now have card readers that accept the most
popular types of cards.
Figure 8-1: You can connect the camera to the computer using the supplied USB cable.

I prefer to use a card reader, for
two reasons: First, when you
transfer via the camera, the
camera must be turned on during
the process, wasting battery
power. Second, with a card reader,
I don’t have to keep track of that
elusive camera cable. And third,
when I copy photos to my desk-
top system, transferring via the
camera requires that I get down
on all fours to plug the cable into
the computer’s USB slot, which is
of course located in the least 
convenient spot possible. The
card reader, by contrast, stays
perched on my desk, connected
to my computer at all times, so
there’s very little physical activity
involved in transferring pictures,
which is how I prefer to live my
life.
If you want to transfer directly
from the camera, however, the
next section explains some important steps you need to take to make that
option work. If you choose to use a card reader, skip ahead to the section
“Starting the transfer process” to get an overview of what happens after you
insert the card into the reader.
Connecting camera and computer
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to your
computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory card.
Also note that in order for your camera to communicate with the computer,
the computer must be running one of the following operating systems:
 Windows Vista 32-bit Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, Enterprise,
or Ultimate edition
 Windows XP Home or Professional edition
 Windows 2000 Professional
 Windows ME 
 Windows 98 Second Edition
 Mac OS X 10.2 and higher

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If you use another OS (operating system, for the non-geeks in the crowd),
check the support pages on the Canon Web site (www.canon.com) for the
latest news about any updates to system compatibility. You can always
simply transfer images with a card reader, too.
With that preamble out of the way, the next steps show you how to get your
camera to talk to your computer:
1. Assess the level of the camera battery.
Just look at the little battery-status indicator at the bottom of the Camera
Settings display. If the battery is low, charge it before continuing. Running
out of battery power during the transfer process can cause problems,
including lost picture data. Alternatively, if you purchased the optional
AC adapter, use that to power the camera during picture transfers.
2. Turn the computer on and give it time to finish its normal startup 
routine.
3. Turn the camera off.
4. Insert the smaller of the two plugs
on the USB cable into the USB port
on the side of the camera.
The slot is hidden under a little
rubber door just around the corner
from the buttons that flank the left
side of the monitor, as shown in
Figure 8-3. Gently pry open the little
door and insert the cable end into
the slot.
5. Plug the other end of the cable into
the computer’s USB port.
Be sure to plug the cable into a port
that is actually built into the com-
puter, as opposed to one that’s on
your keyboard or part of an external
USB hub. Those accessory-type con-
nections can sometimes foul up the
transfer process.
6. Turn the camera on.
The Camera Settings screen appears
briefly on the camera monitor, dis-
playing a “Busy” message. Then the
monitor goes black, and the card
USB port
Figure 8-3: The USB port is hidden under
the little rubber door on the left rear side
of the camera.

access lamp begins flickering, 
letting you know that the camera 
is communicating with the com-
puter. After a few moments (or
minutes, depending on the speed
of your computer), the Direct
Transfer screen appears on the
camera monitor, as shown in
Figure 8-4, and the Print/Share
light, near the upper-left corner
of the monitor, glows blue.
For details about the next step in the
downloading routine, move on to 
the next section.
The options you see on the Direct
Transfer screen relate to a method of image downloading that requires you to
handle everything through the camera menus. I don’t cover this download
technique because I think that most people will find the alternative methods I
discuss here easier and more user-friendly. Nor do I cover the Transfer Order
item on the Playback menu, which is related to the process. However, if you’re
curious about the Wallpaper option you see in Figure 8-4, turn to Chapter 11,
which explains it. Your camera manual also includes specifics about the other
download technique as well.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow 
the steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card
reader, your next step depends, again, on the software installed on your com-
puter and the computer operating system.
Here are the most common possibilities and how to move forward:
 On a Windows-based computer, a Windows message box like the one
in Figure 8-5 appears. The box suggests different programs that you can
use to download your picture files. Which programs appear depend on
what you have installed on your system; if you installed the Canon soft-
ware, for example, one or more of those programs should appear in the
list. The other standard option, Microsoft Camera and Scanner Wizard,
enables you to use the operating system’s own transfer software. To pro-
ceed, just click the transfer program that you want to use and then click
OK. (The figure features the Windows XP Home Edition version of the
dialog box.)
197
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Figure 8-4: When the camera is ready to
download images, the Direct Transfer screen
appears.

198
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-5: Windows may display this initial boxful of transfer 
options.
If you want to use the same program for all of your transfers, select the
Always Use This Program for This Action check box, as I did in Figure 8-5.
The next time you connect your camera or insert a memory card,
Windows will automatically launch your program of choice instead of
displaying the message box.
 An installed photo program automatically displays a photo-download
wizard. For example, if you installed the Canon software, the EOS Utility
window or MemoryCard Utility window may leap to the forefront. Or, 
if you installed some other program, such as Photoshop Elements, its
downloader may pop up instead. On the Mac, the built-in iPhoto software
may display its auto downloader. (Apple’s Web site, www.apple.com,
offers excellent video tutorials on using iPhoto, by the way.)
Usually, the downloader that appears is associated with the software
that you most recently installed. Each new program that you add to your
system tries to wrestle control over your image downloads away from
the previous program.
If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to
turn that feature off. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.

 Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or
camera is properly connected, all is probably well. Someone — maybe
even you — simply may have disabled all the automatic downloaders 
on your system. Just launch your photo software and then transfer your
pictures using whatever command starts that process. (I show you how
to do it with the Canon software tools later in the chapter; for other pro-
grams, consult the software manual.)
As another option, you can use Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder to
simply drag and drop files from your memory card to your computer’s
hard drive. The process is exactly the same as when you move any other
file from a CD, DVD, or other storage device onto your hard drive.
As I say in the introduction to this chapter, it’s impossible to give step-by-
step instructions for using all the various photo downloaders that may be
sprinkled over your hard drive. So in the next sections, I cover the basic 
drag-and-drop process that involves Windows Explorer and the Mac Finder.
Following that, I provide details on using Canon software to download and
organize your files.
If you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find
lots of information by simply clicking open the Help menu.
Transferring files using Windows Explorer
Windows Explorer is the basic file-management system built in to the
Microsoft Windows operating software. (Don’t confuse it with Microsoft
Internet Explorer, which is a Web-browsing program.)
You can use this tool to transfer image files just as you do to copy or move
any file from a CD, DVD, or other storage device to your hard drive. If you
want to try out this method, first close any automated downloaders that 
may have popped up when you inserted your memory card or attached your
camera to the computer. 
Many people have not yet upgraded to the latest Microsoft operating system,
Vista, so the following steps show you how to transfer files using the version
of Explorer found in Microsoft Windows XP. If you’re a Vista user, the process
is virtually the same, although the design and layout of the dialog boxes you
encounter may be different than what you see in the figures. 
1. Click the Windows Start button and then choose All Programs➪
Accessories➪Windows Explorer.
Or, for faster results, locate the My Computer icon on your Windows
desktop. Then right-click the icon and choose Explore.
Either way, you see a window that lists all the drives and folders on your
computer, as shown in Figure 8-6.

200
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-6: The camera shows up as an icon in the list of drives on your computer.
2. Locate the camera or card reader icon in the list of drives on the left
side of the window.
The location depends on whether you’re transferring from the camera or
a card reader:
• If you’re transferring from the camera, you should see an icon
named Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi (or 400D), as in Figure 8-6.
When you click the icon, a list of all the files on the camera
appears in the right side of the window, as shown in the figure.
• If you’re transferring from a card reader, the drive assigned to the
reader should display the name EOS Digital, as in Figure 8-7. Click
the plus sign next to the icon to display a folder named DCIM. Then
click the plus sign next to that folder to display the folder that actu-
ally contains your images. (The folder’s named 100CANON by
default.) Click the 100CANON folder to display your images in the
right side of the window.
Camera icon

Figure 8-7: With a memory card reader, open the DCIM folder and its subfolder to 
access image files.
To view thumbnails of your pictures, as shown in Figures 8-6 and 8-7,
choose View➪Thumbnails. Note, though, that Explorer can’t display
thumbnails for images captured in the Canon Raw format (CR2) until 
you process them. The section “Processing CR2 (Raw) Files,” later in 
this chapter, explains that bit of business.
3. Select the files that you want to transfer.
Click the first file to select it and then hold down the Ctrl key as you
click additional files. Or, to select all files, press Ctrl+A.
4. Drag the files to the folder where you want to store them, as illus-
trated in Figure 8-8.
The little plus sign next to your cursor indicates that you’re copying files
and not moving them off of your memory card.
You can put your files anywhere on your hard drive that you want. But
because most photo programs automatically look in the My Pictures or
Pictures folder, depending on your version of Windows, placing them in
that folder simplifies things down the line. Look for the folder inside the
My Documents main folder, as shown in the figure.

Figure 8-8: Just drag and drop selected thumbnails to a folder on your hard drive.
Transferring files using the Mac Finder
Don’t care to install the Canon software on your Mac? You can transfer images
through the Finder, just as when you insert a CD or DVD. Insert your memory
card into your card reader or connect the camera and computer and then
follow these steps:
1. Look for the camera or card icon on the desktop.
The icon should wear the nametag EOS_Digital.
If you did install the Canon software, the camera icon does not appear;
instead, the EOS Utility pops to life, and you have to transfer images that
way. With a card reader, you should see the card icon but the Canon
MemoryCard Utility may appear automatically as well. Just close that
utility and move on to Step 2.
2. Double-click the card icon to display its contents in a Finder window.
3. Double-click the DCIM folder.

4. Double-click the 100CANON folder to display your images.
Note that the number of the folder may be higher if you have previously
taken and downloaded lots of images.
5. Select the images that you want to transfer.
Click the first image and then Ô+click additional images to select them.
Or press Ô+A to select all the pictures.
6. Drag the selected files to the folder where you want to store them.
By default, most Mac programs look for image files in the Pictures folder,
so putting them in that folder can save you some time hunting down the
image files later.
7. After the transfer is complete, drag the card or camera icon to the
Trash to eject the device.
Downloading images with Canon tools
The software CD that shipped with your Rebel XTi/400D includes several pro-
grams for transferring, organizing, and editing your photos. For downloading
images, I suggest that you use the tools discussed in the next two sections.
Before you try the download steps, however, you may want to visit the Canon
Web site and download the latest versions of the software in the suite. Even if
you recently bought your camera, the shipping CD may be a little out of date.
Just go to www.canon.com and follow the links to locate the software for your
camera. (You can also download updated manuals.)
In this book, the steps relate to Version 2.2 of the EOS Utility and Version 6 
for ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) and ImageBrowser (Mac). As I write this,
those versions are the most recent available for Windows XP, Windows Vista,
and Mac OS 10.3 and higher. 
After taking care of the software download and installation chores, see the
next two sections for details on how to transfer your images.
Using EOS Utility to transfer images from your camera
Follow these steps to transfer images directly from your camera to the com-
puter using the Canon EOS Utility software:
1. Connect your camera to the computer.
See the first part of this chapter for specifics.
203
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos

204
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
2. Turn the camera on.
After a few moments, the EOS Utility window should appear automati-
cally. If it doesn’t, just launch the program as you would any other on
your system. Figure 8-9 shows the Windows version of the screen; 
the Mac version looks pretty much the same.
You can customize the way that the EOS Utility behaves by clicking the
Preferences button at the bottom of the window. Doing so opens the
dialog box shown in Figure 8-10. Just click through the various panels 
to discover what aspects of the tool you can tweak to your liking.
3. In the EOS Utility window (Figure 8-9), click the option named Lets
You Select and Download Images.
With this option, you can specify which pictures you want to download
from the camera. After you click the option, you see a browser window
that looks similar to the one in Figure 8-11. The figure shows the
Windows version, but the Mac version contains the same basic 
components.
Safeguarding your digital photo files
To make sure that your digital photos enjoy a
long, healthy life, follow these storage guidelines:
 Don’t rely on your computer’s hard drive for
long-term, archival storage. Hard drives
occasionally fail, wiping out all files in the
process. This warning applies to both inter-
nal and external hard drives.
 Camera memory cards, flash memory keys,
and other portable storage devices are sim-
ilarly risky. All are easily damaged if dropped
or otherwise mishandled. And being of
diminutive stature, these portable storage
options also are easily lost.
 The best way to store important files is to
copy them to nonrewritable CDs. (The label
should say CD-R, not CD-RW.) Look for qual-
ity, brand-name CDs that have a gold coat-
ing, which offer a higher level of security
than other coatings.
 Recordable DVDs offer the advantage of
holding lots more data than a CD. However,
as of today, there’s still a DVD format war,
and until the industry settles on one stan-
dard, I’m not quite as comfortable with DVDs
as I am with CDs. So I use DVDs only for non-
critical images; precious family photos go on
CDs.
 Online photo-sharing sites such as Shutter-
fly, Kodak Gallery, and the like aren’t
designed to be long-term storage tanks for
your images. Consider them only a backup to
your backup, and read the site terms care-
fully so that you understand how long the
site will hold onto your files if you stop buying
prints and other products. 

Figure 8-9: EOS Utility is designed for sending pictures from the camera to the 
computer.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-11: Select the thumbnails of the images you want to transfer.
4. Select the images that you want to copy to the computer.
Click the first thumbnail to select it. To select additional images, Ctrl+click
(Windows) or Ô+click (Mac) their thumbnails. Selected thumbnails
appear highlighted, as in Figure 8-11.
5. Click the Download Images button near the top of the window.
Now you see a window that resembles the one shown in Figure 8-12.
Again, the figure shows you the Windows version, but the Mac version 
is different only in terms of its color and design.
Either way, the window shows you where the downloader wants to put
your files and the name it plans to assign the storage folder. If you want
to change this setup, click the Destination Folder button and specify the
storage location and folder name you prefer. You also can choose to
have the picture files renamed when they’re copied; click the File Name
button to access the renaming options.
By default, pictures are stored in the My Pictures or Pictures folder in
Windows and in the Pictures folder on a Mac. You can put your images
anywhere you like; however, most photo editing programs look first for
photos in those folders, so sticking with this universally accepted setup
makes some sense.

Figure 8-12: You can specify where you want to store the photos.
6. Click OK to begin the download.
A progress window appears, showing you the status of the download.
When the transfer is complete, the EOS Utility program closes automati-
cally and either ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac)
appears, with your newly downloaded images appearing in the browser
window. See the next section, “Using ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser,”
for details on using that program.
Using MemoryCard Utility for card-to-computer transfers
Transferring images from a memory card reader involves a different Canon
tool, MemoryCard Utility. To try it out, put your card in your card reader. 
If all the planets are aligned — meaning that the Canon software was the last
photo software you installed, and some other program doesn’t try to handle
the job for you — the MemoryCard Utility window shown in Figure 8-13
appears automatically when you put your memory card into the card reader.
The figure shows the Windows version of the window; the Mac version is
identical except that the top of the window refers to ImageBrowser, which 
is the Mac version of ZoomBrowser EX.
If the window doesn’t appear, you can access it as follows:
 Windows: Open the program called ZoomBrowser EX MemoryCard Utility,
using the steps you usually take to start a program.
 Mac: Start the program called Canon Camera Window. The program
should detect your memory card and display the MemoryCard Utility
window.
207
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos

208
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-13: The MemoryCard Utility enables you to transfer pictures using a 
card reader.
From here on in, everything works just as it does when you download using
the EOS Utility. So just follow the same steps outlined in the preceding sec-
tion, starting with Step 3.
Using ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser
In addition to the aforementioned software tools, your Canon CD contains two
additional programs: ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac),
plus Digital Photo Professional. In this section, you can find out how to orga-
nize your photos using the ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser tool. Although
you can view thumbnails of your images in Digital Photo Professional, that
tool is designed for advanced users, so I don’t cover it in this book.
The next sections give you the most basic of introductions to ZoomBrowser
EX/ImageBrowser, which, in the interest of saving type, I may refer to from
here on in as just “the browser.” If you want more details, the CD that ships
with the program offers a very good online manual.
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use Canon’s software to download and organize your photos
and still use any photo editing software you prefer. And to do your editing,
you don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your

computer, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file
that you put on your system.
Getting acquainted with the program
Figure 8-14 offers a look at the ZoomBrowser EX window; Figure 8-15, the
ImageBrowser window. As you can see, the windows contain most of 
the same basic components, although the Mac version is lacking the row 
of task buttons found in the upper-left corner of the Windows version. The
two versions also offer a different set of image-viewing modes — Preview
Mode and List mode on the Mac and Zoom, Scroll, and Preview modes in
Windows.

Figure 8-15: Click a thumbnail to view that image in the main preview area.
Whichever version you use, you can customize the window layout via the
View menu. The arrangement you see in the figures is the Preview mode
setup. I prefer this mode because it provides easy access not just to your
images, but also to details about the camera settings you used to shoot the
picture. Here’s a quick guide to viewing your photos in Preview mode:
 Select the folder you want to view. Click the folder’s icon in the Explore
panel, found on the left side of the window and labeled in Figures 8-14
and 8-15. If you click the Favorite Folders tab, you see only the My
Pictures or Pictures (Windows) or Pictures folder (Mac) along with any
custom Favorites folders that you create, a topic that you can visit in the
upcoming section “Organizing your photos.” By default, picture files that
you transfer from your camera or memory card using the Canon soft-
ware go into these folders. To view all folders on your computer, click
the All Folders button.
Explore panel
Information panel
Shooting Information

 Preview the images in the selected folder. In Preview mode, the current
image appears at a large size in the middle of the window, as shown in
the figures, and a “filmstrip” of smaller thumbnails appears beneath.
To view the next image in the filmstrip, click its thumbnail. On a Mac,
you then can press the right and left arrow keys on your keyboard to
view your photos one by one. In Windows, the same technique works 
on some keyboards; if not, click the Next and Previous buttons (under
the large preview) instead. Drag the scroll bar under the thumbnails to
scroll the thumbnail display as needed.
 View an image in full-screen mode. For a larger view of a photo, double-
click its thumbnail. (You must double-click the thumbnail, not the larger
preview image.) Doing so opens the image in its own browser window,
displaying the image as large as possible to fit the available screen
space. This full-screen window is called the Viewer window. The next
section explains more about the controls therein. To exit the Viewer
window and return to the main browser, just click the window’s close
button.
 View shooting information. Check out the Information panel, located on
the right side of the window. If you click the Shooting Information button,
you display all the settings that you used to capture the selected image,
as shown in Figures 8-14 and 8-15. Reviewing this data — known as meta-
data — is a great way to better understand what settings work best for
different types of pictures, especially when you’re just getting up to
speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all the other 
digital photography basics. (Note that you may need to scroll the
Information panel display to access the Shooting Information button,
depending on the size of the program window.
Those are the basics of navigating through your images. In the next section,
you can find some hints about viewing your photos in full-screen mode,
inside the Viewer window. After that, the section “Organizing your folders”
explains how to customize the folder setup that the Canon software creates
for you.
Viewing photos in full-screen mode
Double-clicking a thumbnail in the main browser window displays the image
inside the Viewer window. Figure 8-16 shows the Windows version of the
Viewer; Figure 8-17 shows the Mac alternative.
After opening an image in the Viewer window, use these tricks to inspect it
more closely:

 Magnify the image. You can zoom in on your image for a closer look by
using these techniques:
• In ZoomBrowser EX (Windows): Drag the Zoom slider or click the
preview with the Zoom In tool, both labeled in Figure 8-16.
• In ImageBrowser (Mac): Choose a specific magnification level from
the Display Size drop-down list, labeled in Figure 8-17.

 Scroll a magnified image. After you magnify the photo, a tiny Navigator
window appears in the top-left corner of the screen, as shown in the fig-
ures. The little red triangles in the Navigator window indicate the area
that you’re currently viewing in the main preview. To scroll the display
to see another portion of the image, put your cursor in the Navigator
window, within the area bounded by those little red triangles, and drag.
In Windows, you also can click the Hand tool, labeled in Figure 8-16, and
drag in the preview itself. On a Mac, just drag in the preview; your cursor
automatically sets itself to Hand-tool mode as soon as you enlarge the
image display.
 Reduce the view size. In Windows, click the preview with the Zoom Out
tool or use the Zoom slider. (See Figure 8-16.) On a Mac, choose a smaller
zoom size from the Display Size drop-down list.
To zoom out so that you can see the entire image, click the Fit to Window
button in Windows (see Figure 8-16). On a Mac, choose Fit to Window
from the Display Size list instead.

 View the next image in the folder. If you want to inspect more images in
the Viewer, just click the Previous and Next buttons, labeled in Figure

located under the preview.
 Edit the photo. To use the editing tools provided with the program, click
the Edit button, found above the preview in Windows and beneath it on
a Mac. Then select the editing task you want to perform. Chapter 10 pro-
vides more details about shifting into editing mode and using the avail-
able tools.
Keep in mind that the preceding tidbits just give you the basics of using the
Viewer window; for additional tips, check out the program manual.
Organizing your photos
By default, the Canon download soft-
ware puts your picture files into either
the My Pictures or Pictures folder in
Windows and the Pictures folder on a
Mac. Within that folder, the downloading
tools organize the images by shooting
date, creating a new folder for each date
found on the memory card. For example,
in Figure 8-18, you see four folders, one
for each day from December 22 through
25. Each folder contains only the images
shot on that particular day.
If you don’t like this organizational struc-
ture, you can change it. For example, 
you may want to organize images by 
category — family, travel, work, and so
on. I took this approach to my folder col-
lection in Figure 8-18.
To keep things simple, I suggest that you
add these custom folders within the My
Pictures or Pictures folder (Windows) 
or Pictures folder (Mac). That way, you’ll
always know where to look for images on
your computer’s hard drive. And programs that default to looking to those
folders for photos will be able to find them as well. The next mini-sections
show you the basics you need to create custom folders and then organize
images in them.
Figure 8-18: You can create custom
folders to organize images by category.

Creating custom folders
Take these steps to add a folder to the My Pictures or Pictures (Windows) or
Pictures (Mac) list:
1. Click the Favorite Folders tab of the Explore panel, if it isn’t already
visible.
2. Click My Pictures or Pictures (Windows) or Pictures (Mac).
The folder should appear highlighted.
3. Choose File➪New Folder.
The New Folder dialog box appears.
4. Type the name of the folder in the text box and click OK.
Your folder appears as a subfolder under the My Pictures or Pictures
folder.
To create a subfolder within your new folder, follow the same process, but
click the new folder in Step 2. For example, I created two subfolders within
my Travel folder in Figure 8-18.
Managing your image collection
After you create your folders, you can place images into them in two ways:
 Move an image from one folder to another. Display the image thumb-
nail and then drag it to the desired folder. The program moves the image
file to the new folder and removes it from the old one.
 Download new images directly to your desired folder. You can specify
a custom folder as the download destination when you use the EOS
Utility and MemoryCard Utility software to transfer images. See the ear-
lier sections of this chapter for details.
Use these techniques to maintain and further organize your image collection:
 Delete a folder. First, click the folder name to select it. Then, in
Windows, choose File➪Delete. On a Mac, choose File➪Send to Trash. In
both cases, the program displays a message asking you to confirm that
you want to get rid of the folder; click Yes (Windows) or OK (Mac) to
proceed. 
Be careful: This step deletes both the folder and all images inside it!
 Rename a folder. Click the folder and choose File➪Rename. In the
dialog box that appears, type the new folder name and then click OK.

 Rename a picture file. Click the image thumbnail and choose File➪
Rename. Type the new name in the dialog box that appears and then
click OK. Note: Do not type the three-letter file extension (.jpg or .CR2) at
the end of the new filename. The program adds that data automatically
to the filename for you.
 Delete a picture: Click the image thumbnail to select it. Then, in Windows,
choose File➪Delete; on a Mac, choose File➪Send to Trash. As with delet-
ing a folder, you’re presented with a dialog box asking you whether you
really, really want to dump that image. Respond in the affirmative to 
do so.
Exploring Other Software Options
The Canon browser software is a pretty nifty tool for viewing and organizing
your photos. And it does enable you to perform basic retouching: You can
crop your image and make some adjustments to color, exposure, and sharp-
ness. Chapter 10 shows you how.
But the program isn’t designed for serious photo editing. For one thing, you
can’t perform selective editing — meaning, changing only the part of your
image that needs help. And you don’t get any tools for removing flaws such
as blemishes in portraits and the like.
So my recommendation is that you consider the browser as a good, free tool
for organizing your photos and doing simple picture fixes. But if you find
yourself doing a lot of photo editing, invest in something more capable. Here
are just some of the products to consider:
 Beginning/consumer programs: Unless you’re retouching photos for
professional purposes or want to get into photo editing at a serious level
for other reasons, a program such as Adobe Photoshop Elements ($100,
www.adobe.com) is a good fit. Elements has been the best-selling con-
sumer photo editor for some time, and for good reason. With a full com-
plement of retouching tools, onscreen guidance for novices, a built-in
photo organizer, and an assortment of tools and templates for creating
artistic photo projects, Elements offers all the features that most con-
sumers need.
Figure 8-19 offers a look at Elements 6 for Windows. At present, Adobe is
planning the Mac edition; it may already be on the store shelves by the
time you read this. If not, version 4 is the most recent option for the Mac.

Figure 8-19: Adobe Photoshop Elements offers a good balance of power and ease-of-use.
For other candidates in this category and price range, visit the Web sites
of Corel (www.corel.com) and ArcSoft (www.arcsoft.com). Both compa-
nies offer multiple programs aimed at the beginner-to-intermediate user.
 Advanced/professional tools: The best-known option in this category is
Adobe Photoshop, shown in Figure 8-20. Photoshop offers professional-
grade photo editing tools, a built-in photo organizer, and features needed
by people preparing images for commercial printing, Web design, and
other high-end uses.
Of course, all that power comes at a price: $650. And expect to spend lots
of time getting up to speed with the program, too, because you don’t get
the friendly interfaces and guidance offered by the beginner-level pro-
grams. Nor does Photoshop offer the automated photo-creation features,
such as greeting card templates and clip art, that you find in consumer
programs.
Other programs aimed at the professional market include Apple Aperture
($300, www.apple.com) and Adobe Lightroom (also $300). These two pro-
grams are geared toward users who routinely need to process lots of
images but who typically do only light retouching work.

A few important tips before you buy:
 Check the software’s system requirements to make sure that your com-
puter can run the program. Some of the products I mention here aren’t
available for Macintosh computers; Apple Aperture, on the other hand,
isn’t available for Windows-based systems. Also make sure that your
computer offers the system memory (RAM), processor speed, and other
components that the software requires.
 You also can buy stand-alone photo organizing programs if you aren’t
interested in serious photo editing but want a more powerful image-
management tool than you get with the Canon software. Check out the
offerings in this category from ACDSee (www.acdsee.com), ThumbsPlus
(www.thumbsplus.com), and Extensis (www.extensis.com). 
You may be amused, as I am, to know that the photo industry uses the
term DAM software — for digital asset management — to refer to the
function provided by image-organizing programs. (I dare you to walk
into your local computer store and ask where you can find the DAM 
software. Wait; I double-dare you.)

 Many software companies enable you to download free trials from their
Web sites so that you can actually use the software for a short period to
make sure that it fits your needs. 
Processing Raw (CR2) Files
Chapter 3 introduces you to the Camera Raw file format, which enables you
to capture images as raw data. The advantage of capturing Raw files, which
are called CR2 files on your Canon, is that you make the decisions about how
to translate the raw data into an actual photograph. You can specify attrib-
utes such as color intensity, image sharpening, contrast, and so on — all of
which are handled automatically by the camera if you use its other file
format, JPEG.
The bad news: You have to specify attributes such as color intensity, image
sharpening, contrast, and so on before you can do anything with your pic-
tures. You can’t print them, share them online, or edit them in your photo
software until you process them using a tool known as a raw converter. At 
the end of the conversion process, you save the finished file in a standard 
file format, such as JPEG or TIFF.

Using your mouse as a shutter button
Along with providing a convenient way for you
to download images, the EOS Utility software
enables you to use your computer to actually
shoot pictures as well.
While your camera is connected to your com-
puter, clicking the Remote Shooting button in
the main EOS Utility window displays a panel
containing clickable controls for adjusting the
major camera settings, such as aperture, white
balance, ISO, and metering mode. After you
establish those settings, you click another
button to record whatever scene is in front of
your camera lens.
What’s the point? Well, this feature is great in
scenarios that make having a live photogra-
pher close to the subject either difficult or
dangerous — for example, trying to get a shot
of a chemical reaction in a science lab or cap-
ture an image of an animal that’s shy around
humans. Additionally, the software enables easy
time-lapse photography, enabling you to set the
camera to take pictures automatically at speci-
fied intervals over a period of minutes, hours, or
even days. 

220
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If you do decide to shoot in the Raw format, you can process them with
ZoomBrowserEX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Follow these steps:
1. Click the image thumbnail in the browser window.
2. In Windows, choose Tools➪Processing Raw Images; on a Mac, choose
File➪Processing Raw Image.
A message window appears to provide you with general instructions
about the conversion. Just click OK to close the window and move on. 
(If you don’t want to be bothered with it each time you want to process
a Raw image, select the Don’t Show This Message Again check box
before you close the window.)
Now your photo appears inside the Raw Image Task window, shown in
Figure 8-21. (The window may appear slightly different, depending on
the options you choose from the View menu.)
Figure 8-21: You can convert Raw images using the browser’s Raw Image Task tool.

3. Use the controls on the Image Quality
adjustment panel to adjust the image as
needed.
Figure 8-22 gives you a look at the Windows
version of the panel; the Mac version con-
tains the same components but is arranged
a little differently. Drag the scroll bar on the
right side of the panel to scroll the display
as needed to access all the controls.
The panel offers the following controls:
• Digital Exposure Compensation: Drag
this slider to adjust image brightness.
• White Balance: These controls, based
on the white balance options dis-
cussed in Chapter 6, adjust color. 
You can click one of the white balance
icons in the large panel, or you can
drag the A/B (amber/blue) and M/G
(magenta/green) sliders to tweak the
colors. Or click the little white-balance
eyedropper, labeled in Figure 8-22, and
then click an area of the image that
should be white, black, or gray.
• Picture Style: Here, you can actually
apply one of the camera’s Picture
Style options to the photo. Or you can
customize the style by dragging the
Sharpness, Contrast, Color Saturation,
and Color Tone sliders. Chapter 6
talks about Picture Styles.
• Color Space: You can select either sRGB or Adobe RGB as the image
color space. As discussed in Chapter 6, the latter offers a broader
range of colors, although some of them may be beyond the print-
able range.
At any time, you can revert the image to the original settings by clicking
the Shot Settings button underneath the Image Adjustment panel. (See
Figure 8-21.)
4. Choose File➪Save Image.
You see the Save dialog box shown in Figure 8-23.

5. Set the Save options.
Here’s the rundown on the options that may be foreign to you:
• Conversion Target (Windows) or Images to Save (Mac): These
options matter only if you are processing multiple images at a time.
If you want to do this, the Help system available in the Raw Image
Task window provides how-tos.
• Image Type: This one is the critical setting. Choose EXIF-Tiff (8 bits/
channel.) This saves your image in the TIFF file format, which pre-
serves all image data. Don’t choose the JPEG format; doing so is
destructive to the photo because of the lossy compression that 
is applied. Chapter 3 has details.
• Resolution: This option does not adjust the pixel count of your image,
as you might imagine. It only sets the default output resolution that
will be used if you send the photo to a printer. Most photo-editing
programs enable you to adjust this value before printing. The Canon
software does not, however, so if you plan to print through the
browser, I suggest you set this value to 300. Chapter 9 talks more
about printing.
• Save Folder and Rename File: Use these options to specify a storage
folder and filename for your converted image. 
6. Click Save.
A progress box appears to let you know that the conversion and file-
saving is going forward.
7. Close the Raw Image Task window to return to the browser.
As you can probably tell from looking at the Raw Task Window in Figure 8-21,
these steps give you only a basic overview of the process. If you do regularly
shoot in the Raw format, take the time to explore the Raw Task Window Help
system so that you can take advantage of its other features.
Also know that this raw processor isn’t your only option. Digital Photo Pro-
fessional, provided in the Canon software suite, offers its own raw conversion
tools. Because that program is designed for the more advanced user, the con-
version tools are slightly more complex, but they’re also a little more power-
ful in some regards. Additionally, both Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements offer excellent raw converters. 
Whichever converter you choose, keep these final pointers in mind:
 Always save your processed files in a nondestructive format, such as TIFF.
(If you use Adobe Photoshop Elements or Photoshop, its format, PSD, is
also nondestructive.) If you need a JPEG image to share online, Chapter 9
shows you how to create a duplicate of your original, converted image in
that format.

Figure 8-23: Always save your processed files in the TIFF format.
 Some raw converters, including the ones in the Canon programs, give
you the option of creating a 16-bit image file. (A bit is a unit of computer
data; the more bits you have, the more colors your image can contain.)
Many photo editing programs either can’t open 16-bit files or limit you
to a few editing tools, so I suggest you stick with the standard, 8-bit
image option. Your image will contain more than enough colors, and
you’ll avoid potential conflicts caused by so-called high-bit images.
 Resist the temptation to crank up color saturation too much. Doing so
can actually destroy image detail. Likewise, be careful about overdoing
sharpening, or you can create noticeable image defects. Chapter 10
offers some additional information about sharpening and saturation to
help you find the right amounts of each.

W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and even
then, the operative word was “good,” not “great.” And if you did want a print,
it was a pretty much a do-it-yourself proposition unless you paid sky-high
prices at a professional imaging lab. In those days, retail photo labs
didn’t offer digital printing, and online printing services hadn’t
arrived yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least in the
case of digital photo printing, to a very good outcome.
Your Rebel XTi/400D can produce dynamic prints
even at large sizes, and getting those prints made is
easy and economical, thanks to an abundance of
digital printing services now in stores and online.
And for home printing, today’s printers are better
and cheaper than ever, too.
That said, getting the best output from your camera
still requires a little bit of knowledge and prep work on
your part. To that end, this chapter tells you exactly how
to ensure that your picture files will look as good on paper as
they do in your camera monitor.
In addition, this chapter explores ways to share your pictures electronically.
First, I show you how to prepare your picture for e-mail — an important step
if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by cluttering their inboxes with
ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following that, you can find out how to
create a digital slide show, view your pictures on a television, and join online
photo-sharing communities.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Avoiding Printing Problems
Although digital printing has come a long way in the past couple of years, a
few issues still can cause hiccups in the printing process. So before you print
your photos, whether you want to do it on your own printer or send them to
a lab, read through the next three sections, which show you how to avoid the
most common trouble spots.
Check the pixel count before you print
Resolution, or the number of pixels in your digital image, plays a huge role in
how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture quality.
You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a quick
recap as it relates to printing:
 On your Rebel XTi/400D, you set picture resolution via the Quality
option, found on Shooting Menu 1. You must select this option before
you capture an image, which means that you need some idea of your
ultimate print size before you shoot. And remember that if you crop
your image, you eliminate some pixels, so take that factor into account
when you do the resolution math. 
 For good print quality, the minimum pixel count (in my experience,
anyway) is 200 pixels per linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if 
you want a 4-x-6-inch print, you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi.
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably
those from Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However,
going higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.
Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you
what image resolution produces the best results, finding the right resolu-
tion is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s state-
ments related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. DPI refers to how many dots
of color the printer can lay down per inch; many printers use multiple
dots to reproduce one image pixel.)
 If you’re printing your photos at a retail kiosk or at an online site, the
printing software that you use to order your prints should determine the
resolution of your file and then guide you as to the suggested print size.
But if you’re printing on a home printer, you need to be the resolution cop.
So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important, 
print size or print quality.
If your print size does exceed your pixel supply, one of two things must happen:
 The pixel count remains constant, and pixels simply grow in size to fill
the requested print size. And if pixels get too large, you get a defect

known as pixelation. The picture starts to appear jagged, or stairstepped,
along curved or digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can actually make out
the individual pixels, and your photo begins to look more like a mosaic
than, well, a photograph.
 The pixel size remains constant, and the printer software adds pixels to
fill in the gaps. You can also add pixels, or resample the image, in your
photo software. Wherever it’s done, resampling doesn’t solve the low
resolution problem. You’re asking the software to make up photo infor-
mation out of thin air, and the result is usually an image that looks worse
than it did before resampling. You don’t get pixelation, but details turn
muddy, giving the image a blurry, poorly rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 and 9-2 show you the same image as
it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of this book),
at 50 ppi, and resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see, there’s just
no way around the rule: If you want the best quality prints, you need the right
pixel count from the get-go.

Figure 9-2: Adding pixels in a photo editor doesn’t 
rescue a low-resolution original.
Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, your Canon produces images that have an aspect
ratio of 3:2. That is, images are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just like a 35mm
film negative — which means that they translate perfectly to the standard 
4-x-6-inch print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images, which means
the pictures must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 
8 x 10, 11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those pro-
portions. Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an
empty margin along the edges of the print as needed.
As a point of reference, both images in Figure 9-3 show you an original, 3:2
image. The blue outlines indicate how much of the original can fit within a 
5-x-7-inch frame and an 8-x-10-inch frame.

Figure 9-3: Composing your shots with a little head room enables you to crop to different frame sizes.
Chapter 10 shows you how to crop your image using the free Canon software
that shipped with your camera. You also can usually crop your photo using
the software provided at online printing sites and at retail print kiosks. But if
you plan to simply drop off your memory card for printing at a lab, be sure 
to find out whether the printer automatically crops the image without your
input. If so, use your photo software to crop the photo, save the cropped
image to your memory card, and deliver that version of the file to the printer. 
To allow yourself printing flexibility, leave at least a little margin of background
around your subject when you shoot, as I did for the example in Figure 9-3.
Then you don’t clip off the edges of the subject no matter what print size you
choose. (Some people refer to this margin padding as head room, especially
when describing portrait composition.)

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Get print and monitor colors in synch
Your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue,
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 Your monitor needs to be calibrated. When print colors don’t match
what you see on your computer monitor, the most likely culprit is actu-
ally the monitor, not the printer. If the monitor isn’t accurately calibrated,
the colors it displays aren’t a true reflection of your image colors.
To ensure that your monitor is displaying photos on a neutral canvas,
start by running a software-based calibration tool. One better-known
tool is Adobe Gamma, shown in Figure 9-4, which ships with the Windows
version of Photoshop Elements. If you use a Mac, the operating assistant
offers a built-in calibrator called the Display Calibrator Assistant. You
also can find free calibration software online; just search for the term free
monitor calibration software.
Software-based tools, though, depend on your eyes to make decisions
during the calibration process. For a more reliable calibration, you may
want to invest in a hardware solution, such as the Pantone Huey ($90,
www.pantone.com) or the ColorVision Spyder2express ($70, www.data
color.com). These products use a device known as a colorimeter to accu-
rately measure your display colors.
Figure 9-4: Calibration software such as Adobe Gamma helps 
ensure accurate monitor colors.

Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor pro-
file, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every
month or so, as monitor colors drift over time.
 One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints look
great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is an
empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your manual
to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep the noz-
zles or print heads in good shape.
If black-and-white prints have a color tint, you might assume that your
black ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the problem
is usually a color cartridge instead. Most printers use both color and
black inks even for black-and-white prints, and if one color is missing, 
a tint results.
When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-
party brands, while they may save you money, may not deliver the 
performance you get from the cartridges made by your printer manufac-
turer. A lot of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the
printer’s ink-delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously
knows most about that delivery system.
 You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper-
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the
printer lays down ink on the paper.
 Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: The cheap, store-brand
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced,
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system.
 Your printer and photo software are fighting over color management
duties. Some photo programs offer color management tools, which are
features that enable the user to control how colors are handled as an
image passes from camera to monitor to printer. Most printer software
also offers color management features. The problem is, if you enable
color management controls both in your photo software and your printer
software, you can create conflicts that lead to wacky colors. So check
your photo software and printer manuals to find out what color manage-
ment options are available to you and how to turn them on and off.
231
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

232
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect per-
fect color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t repro-
duce the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addition,
monitor colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, generated
with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source
has its own influence on the colors you see.
Printing Online or In-Store
Normally, I’m a do-it-yourself type of gal. I mow my own lawn, check my own
tire pressure, hang my own screen doors. I am woman; hear me roar. Unless,
that is, I discover that I can have someone else do the job in less time and for
less money than I can — which just happens to be the case for digital photo
printing. Although I occasionally make my own prints for fine-art images that
I plan to sell or exhibit, I have everyday snapshots made at my local retail
photo lab.
Unless you’re already very comfortable with computers and photo printing, I
suggest that you do the same. Compare the cost of retail digital printing with
the cost of using a home or office photo printer — remember to factor in the
required ink, paper, and your precious time — and you’ll no doubt come out
ahead if you delegate the job.
You can choose from a variety of retail printing options, as follows:
 Drop-off printing services: Just as you used to leave a roll of film at the
photo lab in your corner drug store or camera store, you can drop off
your memory card, order prints, and then pick up your prints in as little
as an hour.
 Self-serve print kiosks: Many photo labs, big-box stores, and other retail
outlets also offer self-serve print kiosks. You insert your memory card
into the appropriate slot, follow the onscreen directions, and wait for
your prints to slide out of the print chute.
 Online with mail-order delivery: You can upload your photo files to
online printing sites and have prints mailed directly to your house.
Photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Snapfish are
well-known players in this market. But many national retail chains, such
as Ritz Cameras, Wal-Mart, and others also offer this service.
 Online with local pickup: Here’s my favorite option. Many national
chains enable you to upload your picture files for easy ordering but pick
up your prints at a local store.

This service is a great way to share prints with friends and family who
don’t live nearby. I can upload and order prints from my desk in
Indianapolis, for example, and have them printed at a store located 
a few miles from my parents’ home in Texas.
Printing from ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser
If you prefer to print your own pictures on a home or office printer, the process
is much the same as printing anything from your computer: You open the pic-
ture file in your photo software of choice, choose File➪Print, and specify the
print size, paper size, paper type, and so on, as usual.
The following steps show you how to get the job done using Canon Zoom-
Browser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Chapter 8 introduces you to
this free software, so you may want to pop to that chapter to find out how 
to browse your images using the program if you haven’t already done so.
Then walk this way:
1. Click the thumbnail for the image that you want to print. 
2. Choose File➪Print➪Photo Print.
Your image then appears inside the Photo Print window, shown in 
Figure 9-5. The figure shows the Windows XP version of the Photo Print
features. If you’re a Mac user, your window lacks the gray task panel that
appears on the left in Windows, but don’t fret: The critical printing set-
tings remain the same, albeit with a slightly different look.
3. Select a printer.
In Windows, choose the printer from the Name drop-down list. On a Mac,
select your printer from the Printer drop-down list.
4. Specify your printer settings.
• Windows: Click the Properties button.
• Mac: Click the Page Setup button.
Either way, you’re taken to the standard print-setup dialog box for your
printer. The options therein depend on your printer, so check your
manual for guidance. But be sure to specify the following settings:
• Paper size
• Paper type (glossy, plain paper, and so on)
• Borderless printing on or off (if your printer offers this feature)
The browser software automatically chooses the print orientation (por-
trait or landscape) that best fits the image. Even though you can select
an orientation option in your printer setup dialog box, the program over-
rides you later if it deems necessary.

Figure 9-5: Your first step is to select a printer and paper size.
When you finish establishing the printer settings, click OK to return to
the Photo Print window.
5. Adjust the image cropping as necessary.
By default, the browser automatically enlarges and/or crops your image
to fit your chosen paper size if necessary. To see exactly what has been
cropped in Windows, click the Trim Image button. On a Mac, click the
button labeled Remove Unwanted Regions of Your Photo.
In both cases, your image opens in Trim Image editing window, shown in
Figure 9-6, which contains some of the controls that you see when you
use the program’s editing functions.
Chapter 10 details the Trim Image editing controls, but here’s the short
story:
• The box with the little white squares around it indicates the crop
box. Anything outside the box won’t be printed.
• Drag any of those squares to adjust the size of the crop box. You’re
limited to setting the box to the same proportions as your selected
paper size.

Figure 9-6: You can adjust the image cropping if needed.
• Drag inside the box to move it over a different part of the photo.
• Click the Orientation icons (Windows) or Trimming Frame buttons
(Mac) if you want to change the layout of the cropping box (hori-
zontal or vertical).
• Click OK to apply the new cropping and return to the Photo Print
window.
If you don’t want your photo to be cropped or enlarged at all, you need
to exit the printing process and adjust a program preference. See the
end of these steps for details.
6. Add the shooting date/time (optional).
You can print the date and time that the photo was taken by choosing an
option from the Shooting Date/Time drop-down list. The program deter-
mines the date and time from data in the image file.
If you do choose to print the date and time, click the Properties button
to set the font, size, and placement of the type.

7. Add a caption to the photo (optional).
To add more type to your photo, click the Insert Text button (Windows)
or the Add Some Text to Print with This Photo button (Mac). Either way,
you’re taken to the Insert Text window, which offers most of the same
text tools as the regular Insert Text window, which I cover at the end of
Chapter 10.
8. Click the Print button.
Your photo file is shipped to the printer.
As I mentioned in Step 5, you can choose to turn off the automatic cropping
that occurs by default. First, close the Photo Print window if it’s open. Then
take these steps:
 Windows: Choose Tools➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog box.
Click the Printing tab and select the Do Not Allow Trimming of the Image
option. Click OK to close the dialog box.
 Mac: Choose ImageBrowser➪Preferences. Select Photo Print from the
drop-down list at the top of the dialog box that appears. Then select Do
Not Trim and click OK.
If you take this step, the Trim function inside the Photo Print dialog box
becomes disabled, so you must do any cropping before you print.
Although it’s fine for casual printing, Photo Print lacks some features that are
typically found in most photo editors and even in the software that ships
with most photo printers. You can’t print multiple images on the same page,
for example, or even multiple copies of the same photo. So if you own other
software, you may find it more convenient than using the browser’s print
functions.
Whatever software you use, be sure to follow the resolution guidelines set out
near the beginning of this chapter. And note that the Photo Print window
doesn’t warn you if your image doesn’t contain enough pixels to produce a
good print at the size you select. So before you begin printing, check that
pixel count by displaying the Shooting Information panel in the main browser
window. The Image Size listing, highlighted in Figure 9-7, shows you the pixel
count.
Preparing Pictures for E-Mail
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the one
in Figure 9-8? Some well-meaning friend or relative has sent you a digital
photo that is so large that it’s impossible to view the whole thing on your
monitor.

Figure 9-7: Make sure that the pixel count is adequate for the print size. 
Figure 9-8: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.
Photo resolution
237
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

238
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number of
pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and the
capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the aver-
age photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess of
what the monitor can handle. Figure 9-8, for example, shows you how much
of an image shot at your camera’s Medium Quality setting, which produces a
2816-x-1880-pixel photo, is viewable when displayed in a typical e-mail pro-
gram window.
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 450 pixels at its
longest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture
without scrolling, as in Figure 9-9. This image measures 450 x 300 pixels. 
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your Rebel XTi/400D offers two features that
enable you to print directly from your camera or
memory card — without using the computer as
middle-machine — assuming that your printer
offers the required options.
The first of these features, called DPOF, stands
for Digital Print Order Format. With this option,
accessed via your camera’s Playback menu, you
select the pictures on your memory card that you
want to print, and you specify how many copies
you want of each image. Then, if your photo
printer has a CompactFlash memory card slot
and supports DPOF, you just pop the memory
card into that slot. The printer reads your “print
order” and outputs just the requested copies of
your selected images. (You use the printer’s own
controls to set paper size, print orientation, and
other print settings.)
A second direct-printing feature, called Pict-
Bridge, works a little differently. If you have a
PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can con-
nect the camera to the printer using the USB
cable supplied with your camera. A PictBridge
interface appears on the camera monitor, and
you use the camera controls to select the 
pictures you want to print. With PictBridge, you
specify additional print options, such as page
size and whether you want to print a border
around the photo, from the camera as well.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful
in scenarios where you need fast printing. For
example, if you shoot pictures at a party and
want to deliver prints to guests before they go
home, DPOF offers a quicker option than firing up
your computer, downloading pictures, and so on.
And if you invest in one of the tiny portable photo
printers on the market today, you can easily
make prints away from your home or office —
you can take both your portable printer and
camera along to your regional sales meeting, for
example. 
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with
cabling the printer and camera together. Also,
the camera must be turned on for the whole
printing process, wasting battery power. But if
you’re interested in exploring either printing fea-
ture, your camera manual provides complete
details.

Figure 9-9: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 450 pixels wide or tall.
This recommendation means that even if you shoot at your camera’s lowest
resolution setting (1936 x 1288 pixels), you need to dump pixels from your
images before sending them to the cyber post office. You can take care of that
task and then send the resized image right from ZoomBrowser EX (Windows)
or ImageBrowser (Mac).
As a first step, however, you need to check the file format of the photos you
want to share; they must be in the JPEG format. If they are Raw (CR2) or TIFF
images, the next section shows you how to create JPEG copies for online
sharing. If the pictures are already JPEGs, skip ahead to the section “E-mailing
photos from your browser.” 
Creating Web-friendly copies of Raw and TIFF photos
In Chapter 8, I advise you to save Raw files in the TIFF format after you process
them in a raw converter. TIFF is ideal because it is a nondestructive format —
that is, it retains all your picture data, resulting in the highest image quality.
But there’s one problem with TIFF files: E-mail programs and Web browsers
can’t display them. If you want to share your converted raw files online, you
need to create a copy of the file in the standard online format, JPEG.
239
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

240
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Why not just save your converted raw files as JPEG images at the processing
stage? Because JPEG is a destructive format, eliminating some image data as
a tradeoff for producing smaller file sizes. So the best practice is to save your
original raw conversions as TIFF files and then create JPEG copies for online
use.
In ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac), you can use the
Export command to create a JPEG copy and reduce the pixel count to a reso-
lution suitable for onscreen display at the same time. Follow these steps:
1. Select the image by clicking its thumbnail in the browser.
2. Choose File➪Export➪Export Still Images (Windows) or File➪Export
Image (Mac).
Export is the geekspeak way of saying “save this file in a different format.”
In Windows, you next see a window that contains the file-saving options,
as shown in Figure 9-10. On a Mac, you see the Write a Still Image box
instead; click Edit and Save Image and then click the Next button to get
to the file-saving options. They’re arranged a little differently on the Mac
than in Figure 9-10, but the basic controls are the same.
3. Set the image size.
To keep the original pixel count, deselect the Resize Images During
Export check box (Windows) or Resize the Image box (Mac). If you do
want to resample the image (trim the pixel count), select the box, as
shown in the figure. Then click the Long Side option (Windows) or
Specify the Length Dimension (Mac) and type a value in the neighboring
box. The value you enter determines the number of pixels the image
contains along its longest side. When resizing the image, the program
will automatically set the pixel count of the shortest side to retain the
original image proportions.
For e-mail images, I suggest setting the long side of the image to 450
pixels or less. This ensures that the recipient can view the entire image
without scrolling the e-mail window.
4. Select the Change Image Type check box.
5. Select the JPEG format from the drop-down list under the check box.
This sets the file format to JPEG.
6. Use the Quality slider to set the desired image quality.
At the highest Quality setting, the program applies the least amount of
JPEG compression, which is the process that reduces file sizes by dump-
ing image data. For acceptable image quality, I suggest that you set the
slider either to Highest or High. (Your file size is already pretty small
because of the reduced pixel count.)

Figure 9-10: Use the Export command to create a JPEG copy of a TIFF photo.
7. Specify a filename.
You have two options: If you deselect the Add a Prefix check box
(Windows) or the Rename the File box (Mac), the program gives your
JPEG copy the same name as the original — for example, IMG_7813.TIF
becomes IMG_7813.JPG.
You also can assign a new filename. First, select the Add a Prefix check
box (Windows) or the Rename the File box (Mac). Then type the text 
in the adjacent text box. Note that the program automatically adds the
numbers 0001 to the end of whatever text you enter. For example, if you
type Web in the box, the filename of your JPEG copy will be Web0001.jpg.
If you stick with the text that the program enters in the box for you 
automatically — IMG_ — the filename will be IMG_0001.jpg.
8. Choose the folder where you want to store the JPEG file.
In Windows, you do this by using the Save to Folder option. Click
Current Folder to put the copy in the same folder as the original. Click
My Pictures to put the copy in that folder instead, or click Browse to
select another folder.
In Windows, you may need to scroll the window display to access the
Save to Folder option, as shown in Figure 9-11.
On a Mac, the current folder destination appears at the bottom of the
dialog box; click the Browse button to select a different storage bin.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-11: Scroll the window display to reveal the Save to Folder option.
9. Click Finish to save the copy.
After creating your Web-ready image, you can attach it to an e-mail message
just as you do any file.
E-mailing photos from the browser
You can resize and e-mail JPEG photos directly from ZoomBrowser EX
(Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Follow these steps:
1. In the browser, select the images that you want to share.
Click the first image and then either Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click
(Mac) additional images.
2. Start the e-mail tool.
How you do it depends on your operating system:
• Windows: Choose Internet➪Send Images by Email.
• Mac: Choose Internet➪Create Images for Email.
In Windows, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-12. The Mac ver-
sion looks a little different, but contains the same critical controls.

Figure 9-12: Select Using Custom Settings and click Custom Settings to specify the pixel count.
3. Select the Using Custom
Settings option button.
Why not use the program’s rec-
ommended settings? Because if
you do, your e-mail image is
sized to 640 x 480 pixels. On
some computer screens, even
that size is too large to be
viewed without scrolling.
4. Click the Custom Settings
button.
In Windows, you see the dialog
box shown in Figure 9-13. The
Mac version contains the same
basic options, plus a couple
additional options related to
digital movies, which you can
ignore. In both versions, the
dialog box enables you to spec-
ify the width or height of your
243
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
Figure 9-13: You can create a custom setting to
apply to all your e-mail photos.

244
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
picture and then preview the
resulting file size and onscreen
display size.
5. Open the Image Size drop-
down list and click Custom
Size.
Now a second dialog box opens,
offering the options shown in
Figure 9-14. Here, you can spec-
ify the exact pixel count you
want the photo to have.
6. Click the Long Side button and
enter a size value in the adja-
cent box.
This value determines the maximum height of a vertically oriented pic-
ture or the maximum width of a horizontally oriented picture. Again, I
recommend a value of 450 pixels, but you make the call.
Whatever value you enter, the program will handle setting 
the value for the shortest side when it resizes the image.
7. Click OK to close the dialog box.
The image size you specified now appears as an option in the drop-down
list. So the next time you send an image, you can skip Steps 5 and 6 and
simply select that size from the list.
8. Specify the picture quality by dragging the Quality slider.
This setting determines how much JPEG compression is applied. As
Chapter 3 explains, JPEG compression reduces the size of a picture file
by getting rid of some image data. The more compression you apply, the
smaller the file and the lower the picture quality.
After you drag the slider, click the Calculate button. The program does 
a quick calculation, and the Modified File Size value then shows you the
file size that will result from the chosen Quality setting. And if you click
the Preview button, you can view a preview of how the image will look 
at the selected setting.
Because the new pixel count of your photo already results in a very small
file, you can use a high Quality setting without worrying too much about
download times. The exception is if you are sending a picture to some-
one who uses a dial-up connection, in which case I would bump the
Quality slider down a notch. You also may want to reduce the Quality
slightly if you are attaching multiple pictures to the same e-mail message
so that the combined download time isn’t excessive.
Figure 9-14: Set the pixel count for the picture’s
longest side.

9. Tell the program to automatically fire up your e-mail program after it
resizes the photo.
• Windows: Select the Attach to Email option.
• Mac: Select the Start Email Application After Closing option.
10. Click OK to close the Custom Settings dialog box.
You’re returned to the main e-mail utility window.
11. Click the arrow labeled Confirm Current to review the image size 
settings.
If anything is off, click the Custom Settings button to adjust the settings.
12. Click Attach to Email (Windows) or Finish (Mac).
The program creates your e-mail copy, fires up your e-mail program, and
creates a new message window. The images are automatically attached
to the message, so all you have to do is enter the recipient’s e-mail
address and any message you want to include. Then just send the mes-
sage as you normally do.
The software does not save a copy of the resized e-mail image on your com-
puter’s hard drive. If you do want to create and save a small copy of the
photo, follow Steps 1 through 8 and then proceed like so:
 Windows: Select the Save to Folder button and then click the Browse
button to select the folder where you want to store the resized copy 
of the photo. In Step 12, click the Save to Folder button.
 Mac: Deselect the Attach to Email button in Step 9. Then click the Finish
button. You can’t specify a different folder location; the copy is auto-
matically placed in the same folder as the original.
Windows or Mac, the program gives the resized image the same name as the
original but tags the characters “_1” onto the end of the name so that you
don’t overwrite the original. Your e-mail program isn’t started automatically,
but you can take care of that step yourself, creating your message and attach-
ing the picture files just as you do any file that you want to share by e-mail.
Creating an In-Camera Slide Show
Many photo-editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or, if copied to a DVD, on a
DVD player. You can even add music, special transition effects, and the like 
to jazz up your presentations.
245
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

246
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
But if you just want a simple slide show — that is, one that just displays all
the photos on the camera memory card one by one — you don’t need a com-
puter or any photo software. You can create and run the slide show right on
your camera. And by connecting your camera to a television, as outlined in
the next section, you can present your show to a whole roomful of people.
Follow these steps:
1. Display the Playback menu and
highlight Auto Play, as shown in
Figure 9-15.
2. Press Set.
The images are displayed sequen-
tially on the monitor, with each
image appearing for about four
seconds. After the last image is
displayed, the show automati-
cally begins again.
Online photo sharing: Read the fine print
If you want to share more than a couple of
photos, consider posting your images at an
online photo-album site instead of attaching
them to e-mail messages. Photo-sharing sites
such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Picasa all
enable you to create digital photo albums and
then invite friends and family to view your pic-
tures and order prints of their favorites.
At most sites, picture-sharing is free, but your
albums and images are deleted if you don’t
order prints or make some other purchase from
the site within a specified amount of time.
Additionally, many free sites enable you to
upload high-resolution files for printing but then
don’t let you retrieve those files from the site. (In
other words, don’t think of album sites as
archival storage solutions.) And here’s another
little bit of fine print to investigate: The mem-
bership agreement at some sites states that you
agree to let the site use your photos, for free, for
any purpose that it sees fit.
If the restrictions of a free site bug you, consider
subscribing to a paid site such as Phanfare
(www.phanfare.com). For a yearly membership
fee — about $50, for Phanfare — you can store
and share high-resolution image files with no
further purchase obligations. And when you
invite others to view your albums, they can not
only view your images, but also download those
high-res originals if needed, making this a good
way to distribute images to clients and col-
leagues. Paid sites also are usually free of the
pop-up advertising that clutters the free sites,
giving them a more professional look and feel.
Figure 9-15: Choose Auto Play to set up
automatic playback of all pictures on your
memory card.

During auto playback, you can control the display as follows:
 Pause playback. Press the Set button. Press the button again to restart
playback.
 Change the information display style. Press the DISP button. (See
Chapter 4 for details about the available display styles.)
 Exit auto playback mode. Press the Menu button.
Viewing Your Photos on a Television
Your Rebel XTi/400D is equipped with a video-out port, which is tucked under
the little rubber cover on the left rear side of the camera, as shown in 
Figure 9-16. That feature means that you can output your pictures for display
on a television screen.
To take advantage of this option, dig through your camera box until you find
the video cable, which has little yellow plug ends like the one you see on the
right in Figure 9-16. Then, making sure that the camera is off, use the cable to
connect the camera’s video-out port to the video-in port on your television,
as shown in the right side of the figure. (The plug end that is long and skinny,
with a black ring near its tip, goes into the camera.) You can also insert the
plug into the video-in port on a VCR or DVD player that’s connected to your
TV, as shown in the figure.
Figure 9-16: You can connect your camera to a television, VCR, or DVD player.

When the two devices are connected, turn the camera and TV (or VCR or
DVD) on. At this point, you need to consult your TV/VCR/DVD manual to find
out what channel to select for playback of signals from auxiliary input
devices like your camera. After you sort that issue out, you can control play-
back using the same camera controls as you normally do to view pictures on
your camera monitor. (See Chapter 4 for help.) You can also run a slide show
by following the steps outlined in the preceding section.
Note that you may need to adjust one camera setting, Video Mode, which is
found on Setup Menu 2. You get just two options here: NTSC and PAL. Select
the video mode that used by your part of the world. (In the United States,
Canada, and Mexico, NTSC is the standard).

of information presented in the always popular
“Top Ten” list format.
Chapter 10 shows you how to do some minor pic-
ture touchups, such as cropping and adjusting
exposure, by using the free software that shipped
with your camera. Following that, Chapter 11
introduces you to ten camera functions that I con-
sider specialty tools — bonus options that, while
not at the top of the list of the features I suggest
you study, are nonetheless interesting to explore
when you have a free moment or two.

E
very photographer produces a clunker image now and then. When it hap-
pens to you, don’t be too quick to reach for the Erase button on your
camera. Many common problems are surprisingly easy to fix using the
tools found in most photo editing programs.
In fact, you can perform many common retouching tasks
using one of the free programs provided with your
camera. Called ZoomBrowser EX in Windows and
ImageBrowser on the Mac, this software offers tools
for removing red-eye, adjusting exposure, tweaking
colors, sharpening focus, and more.
Chapter 8 introduces you to these programs, show-
ing you how to use them to download, view, and
organize your pictures. If you aren’t already familiar
with those basics, you may want to visit that section 
of the book first. Then return to this chapter, which lays
out the step-by-step instructions for using the editing tools
to repair and enhance your photos.

252
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
A couple of other notes before you start:
 If you shot your pictures using the Raw file format, you must process
them using the raw-conversion instructions laid out in Chapter 8 before
you can edit them.
 Although the tools provided in the free software are pretty good, they
don’t allow selective editing. That is, you can’t apply them just to the
part of your photo that needs help. You can’t brighten someone’s face,
for example, without also adjusting the rest of the image. For that kind of
retouching work, you need a more sophisticated photo editor. Chapter 8
offers some recommendations.
 With a couple of exceptions, the figures in this chapter feature the
Windows versions of the Canon software. Although the Mac version
looks different, the actual steps for getting your retouching work done
are the same unless I specifically state otherwise.
 For simplicity’s sake, I refer to ZoomBrowser EX and ImageBrowser
generically in the instructions here as just “the browser.”
 Finally, Canon occasionally posts updates to its software on its Web site
(www.canon.com). So if you’ve owned your camera for a while, check
the Web site to make sure that you’re using the most current versions of
the available programs. This book features Version 6 of ZoomBrowser EX
and ImageBrowser.
Removing Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the Rebel XTi/400D.
Typically, the problem occurs only in very dark lighting, which makes sense:
When little ambient light is available, the pupils of the subjects’ eyes widen,
creating more potential for the flash light to cause red-eye reflection.
When red-eye does occur, take these steps to fix the problem:
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
Again, Chapter 8 shows you how to get your images into the browser
and keep track of your picture files.
After you double-click a thumbnail, the picture opens in its own Viewer
window. Figure 10-1 offers a look at how the window appears in Windows;
Figure 10-2 shows the Mac version.

Figure 10-1: In Windows, click the Edit list above the preview to access retouching tools.
Figure 10-2: On a Mac, the Edit list appears at the bottom of the window.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
2. Open the Edit drop-down list, as shown in Figures 10-1 and 10-2.
The list appears above the image preview in Windows and below it on a
Mac.
3. Choose Red Eye Correction from the Edit list.
Your photo appears in the Red Eye Correction retouching window.
Figure 10-3 shows the Windows version; Figure 10-4, the Mac version.
4. Zoom in on your photo so that you can get a good view of the eyes.
• In Windows: Zoom and scroll the display using the controls labeled
in Figure 10-3, which work the same way as they do when you view
your photo in the initial Viewer window. Chapter 8 details all the
controls, but here’s a quick reminder: The fastest way to zoom in
and out is to drag the Zoom slider; to scroll the display, just drag in
the Navigator window, which appears whenever the entire image
isn’t visible at the current preview size. Or click the Hand tool,
labeled in Figure 10-3, and drag in the preview itself.
• On a Mac: Zoom by choosing a magnification level from the Display
Size drop-down list, labeled in Figure 10-4, or by clicking the Zoom
In and Zoom Out buttons. The Mac version of the retouching
window does not sport a Navigator window — instead, you use 
the scroll bars to scroll the display.
Figure 10-3: Zoom in for a close look at the eyes.

Figure 10-4: On a Mac, use these controls to adjust the preview size.
5. Click the Manual Mode option.
Why not use Auto Mode? Because in that mode, the red-eye correction
tool can sometimes trip up, “correcting” red pixels that aren’t actually 
in the eye. You’re better off using Manual Mode, which enables you to
specify exactly where you want the program to do its retouching work.
6. In Windows, select the Red Eye tool, labeled in Figure 10-5.
The tool is ready to go if it appears highlighted, as in the figure. If not,
click the tool icon. Mac users can ignore this step.
7. Position your mouse cursor over one of the red eyes.
If the program detects fixable red pixels, a green circle appears, as
shown in Figure 10-5. The circle indicates the area that the tool will try
to correct. As you move your cursor around the eye, the circle may
change size as the program searches for pixels that meet its red-eye 
criteria.
8. Click to initiate the repair.
If you like what you see, move on to the next eye. Or click Undo to get
rid of the correction and then try again.
9. After you finish all eye repairs, click OK.
The Red Eye Correction window closes, and your repaired photo appears
in the Viewer window.

Figure 10-5: The little green circle indicates the eye area that will be replaced.
10. Save your picture in the TIFF file format.
The last section of this chapter provides details (and explains why you
should use the TIFF format instead of JPEG).
Like most red-eye removal tools, the Canon version can do a good job in the
right circumstances. But if the eyes are very bright, the tool may not be able
to make the repair. The best solution is to simply paint in the correct eye
colors. For that type of retouching, you need a more capable photo editing
program; one (relatively) inexpensive yet powerful option is Adobe
Photoshop Elements. You can take a look at that program in Chapter 8. 
In addition, no red-eye remover works on animal eyes. Red-eye removal tools
know how to detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes typically
turn yellow, white, or green in response to a flash. Again, the only answer is
to make the repair with a paint tool.

Cropping Your Photo
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Removing
excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by my original
frog scene, shown on the left in Figure 10-6, and its cropped cousin, shown on
the right. In the original image, there’s just too much going on — the eye has
a hard time figuring out what’s important. Eliminating all but a little of the
surrounding foliage returned emphasis to the subject and created a stronger
composition.
Figure 10-6: Cropping creates a better composition, eliminating background clutter.
You may also want to crop an image so that it fits a specific frame size. As
Chapter 8 explains, the original images from your Canon fit perfectly in 4-x-6-
inch frames, but if you want a 5 x 7, 8 x 10, or other standard print size, you
need to crop your image to those new proportions. (If you don’t, the photo
printer software or retail print lab will crop for you, and the result may not be
the composition that you’d choose.)
Whatever your cropping goal, follow these steps to do it in the Canon
browser software:
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
Your photo appears all by its lonesome in a new Viewer window.

2. Choose Trim (Windows) or Trimming Image (Mac) from the Edit drop-
down list.
Refer to Figures 10-3 and 10-4, in the preceding section, if you need help
finding the list.
After you choose the command, your image appears in the Trim Image
retouching window. A dotted outline, called a crop box, appears around
your photo, as shown in Figure 10-7. (The figure shows the Windows ver-
sion of the screen; the Mac version contains the same 
cropping controls.)
3. Click the Advanced Options button to display all the crop-size controls.
Figure 10-7 labels the button and shows the controls that appear when
you click it. (On a Mac, the control panel pops out of the side of the
dialog box instead of appearing within it.)
Figure 10-7: You can specify a crop size via the Advanced Options controls.

4. Choose an option from the Aspect Ratio drop-down list.
Your selection determines the proportions of the cropped image. You
can go in three directions:
• Manual: This option enables you to crop the image to any propor-
tions. I chose this setting for my frog photo.
• Maintain Original: If you choose this option, the program restricts
you to cropping to the same proportions as your original. In the
case of your Digital Rebel XTi/400D, that’s 3:2.
• Specific Aspect Ratios: You also can select from six specific aspect
ratios: 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, and 16:9. The first number in the pair
indicates the width and the second indicates the height.
5. In Windows, make sure that the Trim button is selected, as shown in
Figure 10-7.
It should be already selected unless you used the adjacent controls to
zoom or scroll the preview. Just click the button to select it if needed.
Mac users can skip this step.
6. Adjust the size and position of the crop box as needed.
Use these techniques:
• Move the crop box. Drag inside the box.
• Resize the crop box. Drag any of the handles — those little squares
around the perimeter of the crop box. I labeled one of the handles
in Figure 10-7.
As you drag the handles, the W and H boxes in the Size of Trimming
Area portion of the dialog box reflect the new dimensions of the
crop box, with the measurement shown in pixels. Keep in mind that
pixel count is critical to print quality. Chapters 3 and 9 provide
details, but the short story is that you need roughly 200–300 pixels
per linear inch of your print. So if you have a finished print size in
mind, monitor the W and H values as you adjust the crop box size
to make sure that you aren’t clipping away too many pixels.
• Set a specific crop size. You also can enter specific pixel dimensions
in the W and H boxes. The crop box automatically adjusts to the
dimensions you enter.
Using the third option is the easiest way to crop your photo to a size
that doesn’t mesh with any of the specific aspect ratio choices. Say that
you want to produce a 5-x-7-inch print from your cropped photo, and
you want an image resolution of 300 pixels per inch. Just multiply the
print dimensions by the desired resolution and then enter those values
into the W and H boxes. For the 5 x 7 at 300 ppi example, the W and H
values are 1500 and 2100, respectively. If the resulting crop boundary
encompasses too much or too little of your photo, just keep adjusting
the W and H values, making sure to always keep the two at the same 
proportions you originally entered.

7. Turn on the Use the Rule of Thirds gridlines (optional).
A classic composition rule is to imagine that your image is divided into
thirds vertically and horizontally and then position the subject at a spot
where two dividing lines intersect.
To help you visualize that concept, the Trim box can display those hori-
zontal and vertical grid lines as shown in Figure 10-8. Just click the Use
the Rule of Thirds check box to toggle the grid on and off.
8. When you’re happy with the crop box, click the Trim Image button.
The cropped photo appears in the preview. If you aren’t happy with the
results, click the Undo button and try again.
9. Click OK to close the retouching window.
10. Choose File➪Save As to save your cropped image.
The last section of this chapter has details.
Figure 10-8: The Rule of Thirds gridlines offer a compositional guide.

Adjusting Color Saturation
Saturation refers to the intensity and purity of color. A fully saturated color
contains no black, white, or gray. In other words, saturated colors are deep,
rich, and bold.
I find that the colors produced by the Rebel XTi/400D are already pretty highly
saturated, but on occasion, an image can benefit from a little saturation bump
in the digital darkroom. Figure 10-9 offers an example. I was drawn to this scene
by the mix of colors, and the original photo, shown on the left in the figure,
seemed a little lackluster in that regard. So I increased the saturation ever so
slightly to produce the image shown on the right.
Be careful about increasing saturation too much, however. Doing so actually
can destroy picture detail as areas that previously contained a range of satu-
ration levels all shift to the fully saturated state. In fact, you can often reveal
detail by lowering saturation a little in your photo editor. For example, 
compare the original (left) and desaturated (right) versions of the image in
Figure 10-10. Notice that the subtle gradations of color in the flower petals
become apparent only in the right, slightly desaturated version.
Figure 10-9: I slightly increased saturation to make the colors pop a little more.

Figure 10-10: Desaturating colors slightly can sometimes reveal hidden details.
Whichever direction you want to go, take these steps to adjust saturation of
your image:
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
Your photo opens inside its own Viewer window.
2. Click the Edit drop-down list.
The list appears above the image preview in Windows; it appears below
the preview on a Mac. (Refer to Figures 10-3 and 10-4 for the exact 
locations.)
3. Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the list.
Your image appears in the Color/Brightness Adjustment retouching
window. The window contents vary depending whether you’re using 
the Windows or Mac version of the program; Figures 10-11 and 10-12
show you both versions.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
4. Set the retouching mode to Color Adjustment.
• In Windows: Select Color Adjustment from the drop-down list at the
top of the retouching window, as shown in Figure 10-11. After you
do so, the window offers three sliders: Brightness, Saturation, and
Contrast.
• On a Mac: Click the Color Adjustment button. The Mac version of
the tool offers just a Saturation and Brightness slider. (Don’t fret;
you don’t want to use that Contrast slider anyway, nor its sibling,
Brightness. More on that topic a bit later.)
5. Drag the Saturation slider to adjust the image as desired.
Again, I caution you against raising the Saturation value too much; you
can easily blow out subtle picture details.
6. Click OK to apply the change and close the retouching window.
7. Save the edited image, following the steps provided at the end of this
chapter.
And now for the promised note about the Brightness and Contrast controls:
Despite what their names may lead you to believe, these tools aren’t the best
options for adjusting image exposure and contrast. You can get much better
results by using the Level Adjustment and Tone Curve Adjustment tools, both
explained later in this chapter.
Tweaking Color Balance
Chapter 6 explains how to use your camera’s white balance and Picture Style
controls to manipulate the colors in your pictures. If you can’t get the results
you want by using those features, you may be able to do the job using the
RGB Adjustment filter offered by the Canon browser. In Figure 10-13, for
example, I used the filter to tone down the amount of blue in the image and
bring out the warm yellow tones of the building instead.
Follow these steps to use the filter:
1. Open the image in its own Viewer window.
You do this by just double-clicking the image thumbnail in the main
browser window.
2. Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the Edit drop-down list.
Look for the list above the image preview if you’re a Windows user; on a
Mac, the list is below the preview. After you choose the command, your
photo appears in a retouching window. Figure 10-14 shows you both the
Windows and Mac versions of the window.

Figure 10-13: I warmed colors to emphasize the buildings rather than the sky.
3. Select RGB Adjustment as the edit mode.
In Windows, select that option from the drop-down list at the top of the
window, as shown in the top image in Figure 10-14. On a Mac, just click
the RGB Adjustment button, as shown in the lower image.
Either way, you gain access to three sliders: Red, Green, and Blue.
4. Drag the sliders to adjust image colors.
The filter is based on three color pairs: red-cyan; green-magenta; and
blue-yellow. (Those six colors happen to be the primary and secondary
colors of the RGB color world, which is the one in which all digital
images reside.) As you move the sliders, you affect both the primary
color and its secondary opposite, as follows:
• Red slider: As you drag the slider to the right, you increase red and
decrease cyan. Drag the slider to the left to diminish reds and
embolden cyans.
• Green slider: Drag this slider to the right to add green and reduce
magenta. Drag to the left to produce the opposite result.
• Blue slider: Dragging this slider to the right increases the amount of
blue and reduces the amount of yellow. Go the other direction to
increase yellow and tone down blues.

Figure 10-14: Select RGB Adjustment to tweak color balance.
In imaging lingo, tools of this type are known as color balancing filters
because they shift the balance between the two opposite colors.
I used the slider settings shown in the figure for my example photo.
5. When you’re happy with the image colors, click OK to close the
retouching window.

6. Save your work according to the steps in the last section of this 
chapter.
Adjusting Exposure
Getting exposure just right is one of the trickiest aspects of photography.
Fortunately, the Canon browser software gives you three tools for tweaking
exposure. The next two sections introduce you to the two most capable of
those tools, the Level Adjustment filter and the Tone Curve Adjustment filter.
(The latter, by the way, is a professional-grade tool usually found only in
expensive programs like Photoshop.)
What about the remaining set of exposure tools — the Brightness and Contrast
sliders that appear with the Saturation slider when you choose Adjust Color/
Brightness from the Edit menu? You might naturally assume that those two
sliders are meant to do what their names imply. And they do — just not very
well. 
The problem is that both sliders affect all pixels in your image. You can’t
brighten just the shadows in your image, for example, without also brighten-
ing the midtones (areas of medium brightness) and highlights. Ditto for the
contrast adjustment. For that reason, you rarely can get good results. So do
yourself a favor and stick with the Level Adjustment or Tone Curve Adjustment
tools. They’re a little more intimidating at first than using the simple Brightness
and Contrast sliders, but they’re actually pretty easy to use once you figure out
what’s what — which is what the next two sections help you do.
Three-point exposure control with 
the Level Adjustment filter
With a levels filter, found in many photo programs, you can adjust your pic-
ture’s shadows, midtones, and highlights individually. Figure 10-15 shows you
the Canon browser’s version of this filter.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Wow, that looks way too complicated for
me.” Trust me, though, that this filter is actually pretty easy to use. First,
ignore everything but the graph in the middle of the box, known as a his-
togram, and the three sliders underneath, labeled Shadows, Midtones, and
Highlights in Figure 10-16. See? Easier already.
267
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 10-15: The Level Adjustment tool isn’t nearly as difficult to use as it appears.
The histogram works just like
the one that appears on your
camera monitor if you view
your images in Shooting
Information display mode,
which I discuss in Chapter 4.
To recap, the horizontal axis
of the graph represents the
possible brightness values in
an image, ranging from black
on the left side to white on
the right. The vertical axis
shows you how many pixels
fall at a particular bright-
ness value. So if you have a tall spike, you have lots of pixels at that bright-
ness value. To adjust exposure, you just drag the three sliders underneath
the histogram, depending on whether you want to shift shadows, midtones,
or highlights. 
Shadows
Midtones
Highlights
Figure 10-16: All you need to worry about are these
three sliders.

Take these steps to try it out:
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail to
open it in a new Viewer window.
2. Open the Level Adjustment retouching window.
• In Windows: Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the Edit
drop-down list, found above the image preview. Then select Level
Adjustment from the drop-down list at the top of the retouching
window, as shown in Figure 10-15.
• On a Mac: Choose Level Adjustment from the Edit drop-down list,
which appears underneath the image preview. (The Mac version 
of the retouching window looks a little different from the one in
Figure 10-15, but the critical controls are the same.)
3. Set the Channel option to RGB.
On a Mac, the option is unlabeled; it’s the pop-up list above the
histogram. 
RGB should already be selected, but check just to be sure. (The other
options enable you to adjust brightness values of the red, green, and
blue color components of the image, which is a color-balancing trick
used by some advanced photo-editing types.)
4. Drag the sliders underneath the histogram to adjust exposure.
Use the sliders as follows:
• To darken shadows: Drag the Shadows slider to the right.
• To adjust midtones: Drag the middle slider to the right to darken
midtones; drag it to the left to brighten them.
• To brighten highlights: Drag the Highlights slider to the left.
Note that as you drag the Shadows or Highlights slider, the Midtones
slider also moves in tandem. So you may need to readjust that slider
after you set the other two.
I dragged the sliders to the positions shown in Figure 10-17 to produce
my corrected image.
5. Click OK to accept the changes and close the dialog box.
6. Save your image in the TIFF file format.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Gaining more control with the 
Tone Curve Adjustment filter
Easily the most sophisticated of the browser’s retouching tools, the Tone
Curve Adjustment filter, often referred to generically as simply a curves filter,
gives you even greater exposure-adjustment control. Whereas a levels filter
offers three control points — you can manipulate shadows, midtones, and
highlights — a curves filter enables you to manipulate specific values along
the entire brightness spectrum.
Figure 10-18 offers a look at the Windows version of the Tone Curve Adjust-
ment retouching window. The Mac version is slightly different in appearance,
but it contains the same main components.
Figure 10-17: I brightened highlights and midtones but darkened shadows slightly.

Again, the controls inside the window seem mighty perplexing at first. But
here’s all you need to know to take advantage of the filter:
 See that line that runs diagonally through the white grid? That’s just
another representation of the possible brightness values in a digital
image. Black falls at the lower end of the line; white, at the top. (The
shaded bars that run alongside the left and lower edges of the grid
remind you of that orientation.) Medium brightness falls dead center 
on the line.
 To adjust exposure, click and drag at the spot on the line that corre-
sponds to the brightness value you want to change. Drag up to brighten
the image; drag down to darken it. For example, in Figure 10-19, I
dragged the center of the line up. The resulting curve — tone curve,
in imaging parlance — produced the exposure change shown in the 
preview.
Figure 10-18: With the Tone Curve Adjustment filter, you get even greater exposure control.
271
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

272
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 10-19: Drag upward to brighten the image; drag down to darken it.
 After a drag, a control point appears at the spot on the line you dragged
to anchor that part of the tone curve, as shown in Figure 10-19.
 You can bend the tone curve as much as you want, in any direction you
want. Just keep clicking and dragging to add control points. But be 
careful — extreme curves or curves with tons of points can produce
really ugly results and odd breaks in color and brightness. I usually aim
for a gentle curve that has no more than six points, including the ones
that are provided automatically at the black and white ends of the curve.
 To increase contrast, create an s-shaped curve; to decrease contrast,
create a reverse-s shape. I used the gentle s-shaped curve shown in
Figure 10-20 to produce the finished mushroom photo. The curve
resulted in a slight bump in exposure to medium and medium bright
pixels and a slight darkening of medium dark and dark pixels. The white
and black areas of the image remain unchanged.
Control point Tone curve

Figure 10-20: An s-shaped curve boosts contrast.
The best way to really understand this filter is to try it for yourself. So take
these steps:
1. Open the image in its own Viewer window.
You know the drill: Just double-click the thumbnail in the main browser
window. (See Chapter 8 if you need help.)
2. Open the Tone Curve Adjustment retouching window.
• In Windows: Click the Edit drop-down list at the top of the browser
window and choose Adjust Color/Brightness. When the retouching
window appears, select Tone Curve Adjustment from the drop-
down list at the top.
• On a Mac: Click the Edit drop-down list underneath the image pre-
view and choose Tone Curve Adjustment to open the retouching
window.
3. Set the Channel option to RGB.
On a Mac, the option is the unlabeled pop-up list just above the grid.
273
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

274
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
As with the Level Adjustment filter, you can also manipulate the bright-
ness values of the red, green, and blue color components of the image
independently through this filter. But if you do, you alter the image
colors instead of making a pure exposure change. Most people find using
a regular color-balancing tool easier; see the earlier section “Tweaking
Color Balance” for a look at that option.
4. Bend the tone curve by adding and dragging control points.
See the preceding list for details on this step. If you need to delete a
point, click it to select it and then press Delete. (The selected control
point appears black.)
5. Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the retouching window.
6. Save your image in the TIFF file format, following the steps at the end
of this chapter. 
Sharpening Focus (Sort Of)
Have you ever seen one of those spy-movie thrillers where the good guys
capture a photo of the villain’s face — only the picture is so blurry that it
could just as easily be a picture of pudding? The heroes ask the photo-lab
experts to “enhance” the picture, and within seconds, it’s transformed into 
an image so clear you can make out individual hairs in the villain’s mustache.
It is with heavy heart that I tell you that this kind of image rescue is pure
Hollywood fantasy. You simply can’t take a blurry image and turn it into a
sharply focused photo, even with the most sophisticated photo software on
the market.
There is, however, a digital process called sharpening that can slightly
enhance the apparent focus of pictures that are slightly blurry, as illustrated
by the before and after images in Figure 10-21. Notice that I say “apparent”
focus: Sharpening doesn’t really adjust focus but instead creates the illusion
of sharper focus by increasing contrast in a special way.
Here’s how it works: Wherever pixels of different colors come together, the
sharpening process boosts contrast along the border between them. The
light side of the border gets lighter; the dark side gets darker. Photography
experts refer to those light and dark strips as sharpening halos. You can get a
close-up look at the halos in the right, sharpened example in Figure 10-22,
which shows a tiny portion of the pencil image from Figure 10-21. Notice that
in the sharpened example, the yellow side of the boundary between the pen-
cils received a light halo, while the blue side received a dark halo.

Figure 10-21: A slightly blurry image (left) can benefit from a sharpening filter (right).
Figure 10-22: Sharpening adds light and dark halos along color boundaries.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
A little sharpening can go a long way toward improving a slightly soft image.
But too much sharpening does more damage than good. The halos become
so strong that they’re clearly visible, and the image takes on a sandpaper-like
texture. And again, no amount of sharpening can repair a truly out-of-focus
image, so all you do when you crank up sharpening is make matters worse.
Both the Windows and Mac versions of the Canon browser software offer a
simple Sharpening tool, shown in its Mac incarnation in Figure 10-23. To use
this tool, just follow the usual steps: Double-click the image thumbnail to open
it in its own Viewer window and then choose Sharpness from the Edit drop-
down list. (See Figures 10-3 and 10-4 if you have trouble finding the list.) Drag
the slider to the right to add sharpening and then click OK to finish the job.
Figure 10-23: The Mac version of the browser offers only a simple sharpening slider.
Windows users, however, have the option of using a more flexible sharpening
tool, called an Unsharp Mask filter. To switch to this filter, just click the
Unsharp Mask tab at the top of the Sharpness retouching window, as shown
in Figure 10-24.
The three sliders provided for the Unsharp Mask filter enable you to control
where and how the sharpening halos are applied, as follows:
 Amount: This slider adjusts the intensity of the sharpening halos.
 Radius: This slider adjusts the width of the halos. Don’t go too high, or
the sharpening halos will become very noticeable.
 Threshold: With this slider, you can limit the sharpening effect just to
high-contrast color boundaries. Try raising the value a few notches up
from 0 when sharpening portraits to sharpen the image without adding

unwanted texture to the skin. I also used this technique to keep the sur-
face of the pencils smooth in my example photo while sharpening the
edges between them.
Whichever sharpening filter you use, don’t forget to save the altered image in
the TIFF file format. The last section of this chapter explains this critical part
of the retouching process.
Figure 10-24: The Unsharp Mask filter provides three levels of sharpening control.
Shifting to AutoPilot
You may have noticed as you explored the Edit drop-down list an option
called Auto Adjustment. If you select this option, the program opens your
image in a retouching window, as usual. Figure 10-25 shows the Windows
flavor of the window; the Mac version is virtually identical. After the window
opens, you simply click the Auto Adjust Image button and sit back and wait.
The program analyzes your image and then makes whatever changes it
deems necessary.
277
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

278
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 10-25: Click Auto Adjust Image to see what changes the program thinks are needed.
As a rule, I don’t recommend this type of automatic image correction tool
because it so often doesn’t produce results as good as what you can do by
using the manual filter controls. Sometimes, the auto filters even muck up
color and exposure more than they “correct” them. And who’s to say that the
program won’t see as a flaw some aspect of the picture that you actually like?
That said, if you aren’t working on important images or you just don’t have
the time or interest in using the more sophisticated tools, go ahead and give
that Auto Adjust Image button a click. If you don’t like what you see, click the
Cancel button and do the job yourself, using the tricks laid out elsewhere in
this chapter.
Adding Text
You know that saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words?” Well, you can
up that count even more by adding text to your photo. You can do so as 
follows:
1. Open your photo in its own Viewer window by double-clicking the
image thumbnail in the main browser window.

2. Choose Insert Text from the Edit drop-down list.
Look for the list at the top of the window if you use the Windows version
of the program and at the bottom if you’re a Mac user. Either way, you
see your photo in the Insert Text retouching window. Figure 10-26 gives
you a look at the Windows version of the window. (Again, the Mac ver-
sion is virtually identical except for sporting different controls for zoom-
ing and scrolling the display. See the first section of this chapter for help
with those controls.)
3. Click in the preview at the spot you want to add the text.
(In Windows, be sure that the Text tool, next to the Zoom tools, is
selected before you click.) A text box appears, as shown in the figure. At
any time, you can resize the box as needed by dragging the little boxes
that appear around its perimeter. To move the box (and any text inside),
just drag inside the box.
4. Type your text.
The text appears both in the image preview and in the Text area on the
right side of the window.
Figure 10-26: You can add captions and other text information.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
If you want to add the date and time you shot the picture, don’t waste
time typing that information. Instead, just click the Import Shooting
Date/Time, and the program finds the data in the image file and adds it
to the text box for you. Similarly, if you added comment text when orga-
nizing your pictures in the main browser, clicking the Import Comment
button enters that text for you. (You can add comments via the Comment
pane that appears when you browse images in Preview display mode.
Chapter 8 explains the basics of browsing images.)
5. Use the controls at the top of the dialog box to set the type 
characteristics.
You can specify a font (type design), size, and color and add bold, under-
line, or italic formatting.
The Antialias option smoothes the jagged edges that can occur when let-
ters contain diagonal or curved lines. As a rule, keeping this option
enabled is a good idea.
6. When you finish creating your text, click OK.
The retouching window closes.
7. Save your edited file as outlined in the next section.
Saving Your Edited Files
Whatever retouching task you do, the last step is to save your edited picture
file. After you click OK to close the retouching window and return to the
Viewer window, choose the Save As command from the File menu. You then
see the standard Windows or Mac file-saving dialog box. Figure 10-27 shows
you the Windows XP version of this dialog box.
You need to take two critical steps inside the dialog box:
 Select TIFF as the file type. TIFF is an image file format that produces
the best picture quality for saved images.
Do not use JPEG as the file type. Every time you edit and save a picture
in the JPEG format, you damage the picture quality slightly because of
the lossy compression that is applied in that format. Chapter 3 has details
on this issue. Should you need a JPEG version of your edited photo for
online use, save it first as a TIFF file and then follow the steps provided
in Chapter 9 to create a Web-sized copy of the picture in the JPEG format.
 Type a name for the picture in the File Name box (Windows) or the
Save As box (Mac). The filename of the original image appears automati-
cally in the box. You don’t have to change the filename — you won’t
overwrite the original file when you save because you aren’t saving it in
the JPEG format (and you can’t save in the Raw format). But I like to add
a tag to the filename that indicates the status of the image — for exam-
ple, IMG_7582 retouched, or PencilsSharpened, or the like.

After taking care of those two pieces of business, specify where you want to
store the file as you usually do. Then click the Save button to save the file
and close the dialog box.

onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end of
one of those late-night infomercial offers — the part
where the host exclaims, “But wait! There’s more!”
The ten features covered in these pages fit the cate-
gory of “interesting bonus.” They aren’t the sort of
features that drive people to choose one camera
over another, and they may come in handy only 
for certain users, on certain occasions. Still, they’re
included at no extra charge with your Canon pur-
chase, so check ’em out when you have a few spare
moments. Who knows; you may discover that one 
of these bonus features is actually a hidden gem that
provides just the solution you need for one of your pho-
tography problems.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Changing the Function of the Set Button
When you’re using the advanced exposure modes, pressing the Set button
while no menu is active displays the Picture Style options, discussed in
Chapter 6. If you don’t use those options very often, you can change the func-
tion of the button so that pressing it displays the Quality options or the Flash
Exposure Compensation options. Doing so enables you to access those set-
tings more quickly than by using the menus.
You also can assign the Set button the same function as the Playback button;
if you do, you can press either button to set the camera into playback mode. 
I don’t think this option is a terribly useful one, but you be the judge.
To customize the button, take these steps:
1. Set your camera to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M,
or A-DEP).
You can’t adjust the performance of the Set button in the fully automatic
modes. Nor does the button perform its menu-bypass function in any of
those modes.
2. Display Setup Menu 2 and highlight Custom Functions, as shown on
the left in Figure 11-1.
This menu item enables you to customize 11 aspects of the camera’s
performance.
3. Press Set to display the Custom Function screen.
The screen should look something like the one on the right in Figure 11-1.
Here, you choose which of the 11 Custom Functions you want to access.
Figure 11-1: The Custom Function menu item provides access to 11 customization options.

4. If needed, press the right or left cross key to display Custom Function
1, as shown in the figure.
You can also rotate the Main dial to cycle through the Custom Functions.
5. Press the Set button.
Now a scrolling list in the center
of the screen becomes activated,
as shown in Figure 11-2.
6. Press the up or down cross keys
to select your choice.
Only options 0, 1, 2, and 3 relate
to the Set button. Option 4
enables you to adjust the per-
formance of the cross keys, as
described in the next section. If
you do customize the cross keys,
you can’t also customize the Set
button’s function.
7. Press the Set button.
Now whenever you shoot in the advanced exposure modes and press
Set while no menus are displayed, the button takes on the function you
just assigned to it. To go back to the default setting, repeat these steps
and select option 0 in Step 6.
Using the Cross Keys to Select 
an Autofocus Point
Through Custom Function 1, introduced in the preceding section, you can
assign one of four different functions to the Set button. Or you can instead
modify the performance of the cross keys so that you can use them to easily
select an autofocus point.
To do so, follow the same steps as outlined in the preceding section but
choose option 4 in Step 6. Now the cross keys work as follows:
 After you press the shutter button halfway, you can press the cross keys
to change the autofocus point. The normal AF Point Selection screen
doesn’t appear; you just use the autofocus point grid that appears in 
the Camera Settings display and viewfinder to select the active point.
(See Chapter 6 for more about autofocus points and autofocusing.)
285
Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Figure 11-2: You can use the Set button to
access Flash Exposure Compensation
settings.

286
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 You can still use the cross keys for their regular functions — that is, to
access the ISO, White Balance, AF Mode, and Metering Mode settings.
Just let up on the shutter button and wait until the Camera Settings
screen no longer displays both the shutter speed and aperture settings.
Then press the cross key for the setting you want to adjust. (Chapter 5
introduces you to shutter speed and aperture.)
Again, this feature works only in the advanced exposure modes. And you
can’t set the cross keys to work this way and also assign a menu-bypass func-
tion to the Set button. So if you do opt to customize the cross keys, pressing
the Set button no longer displays the Picture Style menu, for example, as it
does by default.
Customizing Exposure and Focus Lock Options
By default, pressing your shutter button halfway establishes and locks focus
when you work in autofocus mode. When you shoot in the advanced autoex-
posure modes, you also can lock in the autoexposure settings the camera
selected by pressing and holding the AE (autoexposure) Lock button, labeled
in Figure 11-3.
You can customize these locking
behaviors via a Custom Functions
item on Setup Menu 2. Here’s
how:
1. Set the Mode dial to an
advanced exposure setting.
As with all Custom
Functions, you can take
advantage of this option
only in P, Tv, Av, M, or 
A-DEP exposure mode.
Additionally, the locking
setup you specify applies
only to those modes.
2. Display Setup Menu 2 and
highlight Custom Functions,
as shown on the left in
Figure 11-4.
AE Lock button
Figure 11-3: By default, pressing the AE Lock
button locks the autoexposure setting.

Figure 11-4: Adjust the locking functions via Custom Function 4.
3. Press the Set button to display the Custom Function screen.
4. Select Custom Function 4.
Press the right or left cross key or rotate the Main dial until Custom
Function 4 appears, as shown on the right in Figure 11-4.
5. Press the Set button to activate the scrolling list of settings, as shown
in Figure 11-5.
6. Press the up and down cross
keys to select the option you
want to use.
You have the following four
choices. (The first part of the 
setting name indicates what 
happens with a half-press of the
shutter button; the second part
indicates the function of the AE
Lock button.)
• AF/AE Lock: This is the
default setting. Pressing 
the shutter button halfway
establishes and locks auto-
focus; pressing the AE Lock
button locks autoexposure.
• AE Lock/AF: With this option, pressing the shutter button halfway
locks autoexposure instead of focus. To focus, you instead press
the AE Lock button. In other words, this mode is the exact oppo-
site of the default setup.
287
Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Figure 11-5: Choose 0 to return to the default
exposure- and focus-locking setup.

288
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
• AF/AF Lock: This mode is designed to prevent focusing mishaps
when you use AI Servo autofocusing, explained in Chapter 6. Here’s
the deal: In the AI Servo mode, the autofocus motor continually
adjusts focus from the time you press the shutter button halfway
until the time you actually take the image. This feature helps you
keep moving objects sharply focused. But if something happens 
to move in front of your subject, the camera may mistakenly lock
focus on that object.
To cope with that possibility, this exposure/focus locking option
enables you to initiate autofocusing as usual, by pressing the shut-
ter button halfway. But at any time before you take the picture, you
can press the AE Lock button to temporarily stop the autofocusing
motor from adjusting focus if an intruder does move into the frame.
When you release the button, the autofocusing mechanism starts
up again.
If you choose this option, exposure is set when you press the shut-
ter button all the way. You can’t lock autoexposure.
• AE/AF: Similar to the preceding mode, this one also is designed to
help you capture moving subjects in the AI Servo mode. Pressing
the shutter button halfway initiates autoexposure metering, which
is adjusted continuously as needed until the time you snap the pic-
ture. Pressing the AE Lock button starts the autofocusing servo
system; releasing the button stops it. You cannot lock autoexpo-
sure in this mode.
7. Press the Set button.
Now whenever you shoot in an advanced exposure mode, the camera
locks focus and exposure according to the option you selected. In the
fully automatic modes, the settings have no effect; a half-press of 
the shutter button still locks focus, and you can’t lock autoexposure.
Disabling the AF-Assist Beam
In dim lighting, your camera emits a brief beam of light from the AF (auto-
focus)-assist lamp on the front of the camera when you press the shutter
button halfway. This flash of light helps the camera “see” its target better,
improving the performance of the autofocusing system.
If you’re shooting in a situation where the AF-assist beam may be distracting
to your subject or to others in the room, you can disable it. Or, if you attach
one of the compatible external flash units to the camera, you can choose to
have the flash emit the beam only when necessary.

Take these steps to control this aspect of your camera:
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
As with the other customization options discussed in preceding sec-
tions, this one is available only in these advanced exposure modes.
2. Display Setup Menu 2, highlight Custom Functions, and press the Set
button.
You’re taken to the main launching pad for adjusting all the Custom
Functions.
3. Press the right or left cross key or rotate the Main dial as needed to
select Custom Function 5.
4. Press the Set button.
Now the scrolling list in the
middle of the screen becomes
active, as shown in Figure 11-6.
5. Press the up or down cross key
to scroll to your desired setting.
6. Press the Set button.
Your chosen setting affects all the
advanced exposure modes. In
fully automatic modes, the auto-
focus assist beam continues to
light when the camera deems it
necessary.
Without the aid of the assist beam, the camera may have trouble autofocus-
ing in dim lighting. The easiest solution is to simply focus manually; Chapter 1
shows you how.
Enabling Mirror Lockup
One of the components involved in the optical system of an SLR camera is a
tiny mirror that moves when you press the shutter button. The small vibra-
tion caused by the movement of the mirror can result in slight blurring of the
image when you use a very slow shutter speed, shoot with a long telephoto
lens, or take extreme close-up shots. To eliminate the possibility, your camera
offers a feature called mirror lockup. When you enable this feature, the mirror
movement is completed well before the shot is recorded, thus preventing any
camera shake.
289
Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Figure 11-6: You can disable the autofocus-
assist beam.

290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
To try out this feature, take these steps:
1. Set the Mode dial to an advanced exposure mode.
Mirror lockup isn’t available in the fully automatic exposure modes. So
set that dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
2. Display Setup Menu 2, highlight Custom Functions, and press the Set
button.
3. Select Custom Function 7, as
shown in Figure 11-7.
You can either press the cross
keys or rotate the Main dial to
scroll through the Custom
Functions.
4. Press the Set button.
The scrolling list in the center of
the screen becomes highlighted.
5. Press the up or down cross key
to select the Enable option, as
shown in the figure.
6. Press the Set button.
After you enable mirror lockup, you take a slightly different approach to 
picture-taking than usual. Use this technique:
1. Frame your shot.
2. If using autofocus, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus.
Or, if you prefer manual focusing, twist the focusing ring as needed to
focus the image.
3. Press the shutter button all the way down to lock up the mirror.
At this point, you can no longer see anything through the viewfinder.
Don’t panic — that’s normal. The mirror’s function is to enable you to
see in the viewfinder the scene that the lens will capture, and mirror
lockup prevents it from serving that purpose.
4. Press the shutter button all the way again.
The camera then takes the picture. 
Using a tripod or other support is critical to getting a shake-free shot in situa-
tions that call for mirror lockup. For even more protection, set your camera
to self-timer mode, introduced in Chapter 2, and take your hands completely
off the camera after you press the shutter button in Step 3. The picture is
taken about two seconds after the mirror lockup occurs.
Figure 11-7: Mirror lockup prevents camera
shake caused by the movement of the optical
system’s mirror. 

Adding Cleaning Instructions to Images
You’ve no doubt noticed that your camera displays a message that says
“Sensor Cleaning” every time you turn the camera off. And when you turn 
the camera on, a little “cleaning” icon flickers in the lower-right corner of the
Camera Settings display. These alerts tell you that the camera is performing 
a self-maintenance step that is designed to remove from the sensor any dust
particles that may have made their way into the camera interior.
If you don’t see these alerts, open Setup Menu 2 and be sure that the Sensor
Cleaning:Auto option is set to Enabled — there’s really no reason to disable
this feature, although Canon gives you the choice to do so.
At any rate, the automated sensor cleaning normally is all that’s necessary to
keep the sensor dust-free. But if you notice that small spots are appearing con-
sistently on your images, you may need to step in and take action on your own.
The best solution, of course, is to take your camera to a good repair shop and
have the sensor professionally cleaned. I do not recommend that you take on
this job yourself; it’s a delicate procedure, and you can easily ruin your camera.
Until you can have the camera cleaned, however, you can use a feature on
Setup Menu 2 to create a custom dust-removal filter that you can apply in
Digital Photo Professional, which is one of the free programs that ships with
your camera.
The first step in creating the filter is to record a data file that maps the loca-
tion of the dust spots on the sensor. To do this, you need a white piece of
paper or other white surface and a lens that can achieve a focal length of
55mm or greater. (The kit lens on the Rebel XTi/400D qualifies.) Then take
these steps:
1. Set the lens focal length at 55mm or longer.
If you own the kit lens, just zoom in as far as possible, which sets the
focal length at 55mm.
2. Switch the camera to manual focusing.
On the kit lens, just move the focus switch on the lens from AF to MF.
3. Set focus at infinity.
Some lenses have a marking that indicates the infinity position — the
symbol looks like a number 8 lying on its side. If your lens doesn’t have
the marking, hold the camera so that the lens is facing you and then 
turn the lens focusing ring clockwise until it stops. 
4. Set the camera to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M,
or A-DEP).
You can create the dust data file only in these modes.

5. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Dust Delete Data, as shown on
the left in Figure 11-8.
6. Press the Set button.
Now you see the Dust Delete Data message shown on the right in 
Figure 11-8.
7. Use the right or left cross key to highlight OK and then press Set.
The camera performs its normal automatic sensor-cleaning ritual, which
takes a second or two. Then you see the instruction screen shown on the
left in Figure 11-9.
8. Position the camera so that it’s about 8–12 inches from your white
card or piece of paper.
Your card or paper needs to be large enough to completely fill the view-
finder at this distance.
Figure 11-8: You can record dust-removal data that can be read by Digital Photo Professional.
Figure 11-9: The dust delete data is recorded when you press the shutter button all the way.

9. Press the shutter button all the way to record the dust delete data.
No picture is taken; the camera just records the dust-delete data in its
internal memory. If the process was successful, you see the congratula-
tory message shown on the right in Figure 11-9.
If the camera tells you that it couldn’t record the data, the lighting condi-
tions are likely to blame. Make sure that the lighting is even across the
entire surface of your white card or paper and that the paper is suffi-
ciently illuminated and then try again.
10. Highlight OK and press the Set button.
The date that you created the dust-delete data now appears on the 
initial Dust Delete Data screen (shown on the right in Figure 11-8).
After you create your dust-delete data file, the camera attaches the data to
every subsequent image, regardless of whether you shoot in the fully auto-
matic or advanced exposure modes. 
To clean a photo, open it in Digital Photo Professional and choose Start
Stamp Tool from the Tools menu. Your photo then appears in an editing
window; click the Apply Dust Delete Data button to start the automated dust-
busting feature. The program’s manual and Help system offer details about
this process; look for the Help entry related to using the Copy Stamp tool.
Magnifying Images During Instant Review
Chapter 4 shows you how to magnify your images when viewing them in play-
back mode. When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes, you also have
the option of zooming in on your images during the instant review period.
(See Chapter 1 for information on enabling instant review and changing the
length of time that the picture is displayed.)
Follow these steps to activate the feature:
1. Select one of the advanced exposure modes from the Mode dial.
You can choose P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
2. Display Setup Menu 2, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
You’re taken to the main Custom Function screen.
3. Select Custom Function 10 and then press the Set button.
Just press the right or left cross key or rotate the Main dial until Custom
Function 10 appears. After you press the Set button, the list of options
appears activated, as shown in Figure 11-10.
293
Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
4. Press the up or down cross key
to select Image Review and
Playback.
At the other setting, which is the
default, magnification of images 
is limited to playback mode.
5. Press the Set button.
After you enable instant-review mag-
nification, just press and hold the
Print/Share button during the instant
review period. (The button, shown in
the margin here, is located near the
top-left corner of the monitor.)
While continuing to hold the button, adjust the magnification of the image by
pressing the AE Lock button to zoom in and AF Point Selection button to zoom
out. (Those are the two buttons on the upper-right corner of the camera back,
marked with the little blue magnifying glass icons.) Use the cross keys to scroll
the display. When you’re done inspecting the image, release the Print/Share
button.
Again, even if you enable instant-review magnification, you can take advantage
of it only when you shoot in the advanced exposure modes.
Turning Off the Camera Settings Screen
When you turn on your camera, the monitor automatically turns on and dis-
plays the Camera Settings screen. At least, it does if you stick with the default
setting selected for Custom Function 11, which bears the lengthy name of
LCD Display When Power On.
You can prevent the monitor from displaying the screen every time you
power up the camera if you choose. What’s the point? Well, the monitor is
one of the biggest drains on the camera battery, so limiting it to displaying
information only when you need it can extend the time between battery
charges.
As with other Custom Functions, this option works only when the camera is
set to one of the advanced exposure modes — in other modes, the screen
still appears automatically. Still, any battery savings can be helpful when
you’re running low on juice.
Figure 11-10: Custom Function 10 enables
you to magnify images during instant review.

To take advantage of this feature, take these steps:
1. Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode.
Again, you can access Custom Functions only in these exposure modes.
2. Display Setup Menu 2, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
The Custom Function screen appears.
3. Use the cross keys or Main dial to select Custom Function 11 and then
press Set.
You see the screen shown in
Figure 11-11, with the scrolling
list of settings activated.
4. Press the up or down cross 
key to select Retain Power 
Off Status.
5. Press Set.
6. Press the shutter button half-
way to display the Camera
Settings screen.
You need to take this step
before you can complete the
process of disabling the auto-
mated display.
7. Press the DISP button to shut off the monitor.
Now when you turn the camera off and then on again, the monitor will
not automatically power up and display the Camera Settings screen —
as long as the Mode dial is set to an advanced shooting mode, that is.
Nor will the screen appear when you press the shutter button halfway,
as it normally does. To view the screen, press the DISP button; press the
button again to return to monitor-off status.
Creating Desktop Wallpaper
You can quickly turn an image on your camera memory card into desktop
wallpaper — a background image that appears on your monitor, behind any
icons or program windows. For example, I plastered my Windows desktop
with a water lily image, as shown in Figure 11-12.

Figure 11-12: You can use a favorite image as your monitor background.
To decorate your monitor, follow these steps:
1. Connect the camera to the com-
puter, following the instructions
in Chapter 8.
After a short time, the Direct
Transfer screen appears on the
camera monitor, as shown in
Figure 11-13.
2. Highlight Wallpaper and then
press the Set button.
The camera monitor displays
your most recent image.
3. Press the right or left cross key
or rotate the Main dial to scroll
to the image you want to use as
wallpaper.
Figure 11-13: Highlight Wallpaper and then
press Set to select the image.

4. Press the Print/Share button to start the transfer.
The camera, with help from the installed Canon software, downloads the
image to your hard drive and then saves a copy of it in the correct format
to use for wallpaper. The wallpaper image then appears on the computer
desktop, as shown in Figure 11-12. 
If you prefer, you also can turn an image that’s already on your computer’s
hard drive into wallpaper by using Canon ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or
ImageBrowser (Mac). See the Help system in those programs for how-tos.
Also note that because the images your Canon creates have an aspect ratio 
of 3:2, they won’t fully cover the desktop of most monitors, which typically
have an aspect ratio of either 4:3 or 16:9. If you want the image to fully fill the
screen, you must edit it to the correct proportions and then use the Windows
or Mac display customization tools to turn the edited file into wallpaper.
Chapter 10 shows you how to crop to specific proportions.
Getting Free Help and Creative Ideas
Okay, so this last one’s a bit of a cheat: It isn’t actually found on your camera,
but it will help you better understand the features that are. I speak of the
Canon Web site, which you can access at www.canon.com.
If you haven’t yet visited the site, I encourage you to do so. In the Support
section of the site, you can get free technical support for camera problems
and even download an electronic copy of your camera manual, should you
happen to misplace the one that shipped in the camera box. Most impor-
tantly, check periodically to make sure that your camera is running the latest
firmware, which is the geekspeak term for the camera’s internal software.
(The appendix of this book provides details on installing a firmware update.)
Be sure to also check out the Learning Center section of the site. There, you
can find loads of tutorials and other great instructional offerings not only
about your camera but also about the software that ships with it.

Firmware Notes and Menu Map
In This Appendix
 Checking and updating your camera firmware
 Mapping out all your camera’s menus
F
irmware is the internal software that runs your camera. On occasion, the
camera manufacturer updates this software, either to fix recently discov-
ered problems or to enable minor new features. You can find out which
firmware version your camera is running via Shooting Menu 2, as explained in
the next section.
Speaking of menus, the second part of this appendix provides a handy sum-
mary of all the commands on each of the five menus on your Rebel XTi/400D.
For each menu option, I provide a quick description and, where relevant, a
cross-reference to the chapter where you can find any additional details.
Firmware Facts
Keeping your camera’s firmware current can help you avoid problems down
the road, so periodically visit the Canon Web site to find out whether any
updates have been posted. Start from the Canon home page (www.canon.com)
and just follow the product support links to the firmware updates. (The actual
link names vary depending on which of Canon’s international sites you use.)
To check your firmware version, follow these steps:
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
Otherwise, you can’t view the firmware version information.
2. Display Setup Menu 2.
The firmware version is listed at the bottom of the menu. (Refer to
Figure A-5, later in the appendix, for a quick look.)
At the time I write this, the current firmware version number is 1.1.1. If your
camera has an older version — or a check of the Canon site uncovers an 
even more recent version than 1.1.1 — follow the instructions on the firmware

300

download site to update your camera. These instructions vary depending on
your computer operating system and the firmware release itself, and because
the instructions on the Canon site are very detailed, I won’t waste space
repeating them to you here.
Menu Quick Reference
To help you locate all the features on your Rebel XTi/400D, the following sec-
tions list the options found on each of the camera’s five menus. Chapter 1
details the process of using menus, if you need help.
The options appearing in the menus here are the default camera settings,
which may or may not be the best choice, depending on your subject and
other photographic conditions. So visit the chapters referenced in the table
for details that will help you lock in the right settings.
Shooting Menu 1
Shown in Figure A-1 and detailed in
Table A-1, this menu contains just
four options. The most critical is the
Quality setting, which determines 
the pixel count, or resolution of your
photos, as well as the file format,
which determines whether the
camera creates a picture file using
the JPEG or Raw format. You can
access all menu options regardless 
of the exposure mode currently
selected (Full Auto, Portrait, M, 
and so on).

from being erased from the memory card during the normal 
picture-deleting process. See Chapter 4 for details.
Rotate 
Display vertically oriented photos in their upright position 
during playback mode. See Chapter 4.
Print Order 
Print directly from a memory card, using a card slot on a 
photo printer that supports DPOF (Digital Print Order Format). 
Before removing the card, use this option to select pictures 
that you want to print and specify the number of copies. 
Chapter 9 has details.
Transfer Order
Select specific images to download when you transfer 
picture files to the computer via a USB cable. See Chapter 8 
for help with alternative (and easier) options for downloading.
Auto Play
Start automatic playback of all the images on your memory 
card, one by one, in the camera monitor. Chapter 9 has 
specifics.
Review Time
Specify how long you want pictures to be displayed on the 
camera monitor during the instant review period. See 
Chapter 4 for more information.
Histogram
Choose the style of histogram that appears when you display 
shooting information along with the image during playback. 
Chapter 4 details your histogram options.
Figure A-3: Playback menu options affect
more than image viewing.

Setup Menu 1
This menu, featured in Figure A-4, 
contains options that affect the basic
operation of your camera, such as the
brightness level of the monitor and
the way that new picture files are 
numbered. Table A-4 offers a review 
of what each menu option 
accomplishes.
Table A-4
Setup Menu 1
Menu Option
Choose This Option To . . . 
Auto Power Off
Change the length of time that the camera must be idle 
before it automatically shuts down to conserve battery 
power. Chapter 1 explains your options.
Auto Rotate
Tell the camera to include information about the original 
picture orientation (portrait or landscape) along with the 
image file so that the picture is automatically rotated to 
the proper position during playback and when viewed in 
photo programs that can read the data. See Chapter 1 
for details.
LCD Brightness
Increase or decrease the monitor brightness; Chapter 1 
offers a word of caution on this subject.
LCD Auto Off
Enable or disable the feature that automatically turns off 
the monitor when you put your eye to the viewfinder. 
Chapter 1 spells out this option, too.
Date/Time
Set the camera’s internal date and time clock, which affects 
the date and time that’s recorded in the picture metadata
(camera data that you can view in many photo programs). 
See Chapter 8 for information about viewing metadata.
File Numbering
Determine the numbering scheme the camera uses in 
picture filenames. Chapter 1 talks about this important 
setting.
Format
Erase all memory card data and prepare the card for use by 
the camera. Chapter 4 discusses the difference between 
formatting the card and simply deleting images.

Setup Menu 2
This second menu of setup options
contains many features that are
designed for advanced users. For that
reason, when the camera is set to Full
Auto mode or any of the other fully
automatic shooting modes covered 
in Chapter 2, Setup Menu 2 offers
access only to the Language, Video
System, and Sensor Cleaning:Auto
options. To access the entire list 
of options, shown in Figure A-5, set 
the camera’s Mode dial to one of the
advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av,
M, or A-DEP). Table A-5 describes the
function of each option.

connect the camera to a television or other video device. 
See Chapter 9 for help.
Custom Functions
Access the 11 Custom Functions, which provide additional

as well as a couple of operational options. Chapter 11 details 
many of the Custom Functions; also see Chapter 5 for 
details about the ones related to exposure.
Clear Settings
Restore the camera’s default settings. 
Sensor Cleaning: 
Turn the camera’s automatic sensor-cleaning mechanism on 
Auto
or off. Chapter 1 has more information.
Sensor Cleaning: 
Prepares the camera for manual sensor cleaning, a job that 
Manual
is best left to the professionals. See Chapter 1 for details and 
check out Chapter 11 for some other sensor cleaning tips.
Firmware Ver
Displays the current version of the camera’s firmware (inter-
nal software). See the start of this appendix for details.
