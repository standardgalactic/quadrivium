Abstract
The
mo
died
realizabili
t
y
top
os
is
the
seman
tic
(and
higher
order)
coun
terpart
of
a
v
arian
t
of
Kreisel's
mo
died
realizabili
t
y
(	).
These
y
ears,
this
realizabili
t
y
has
b
een
in
the
limelight
again
b
ecause
of
its
p
os-
sibiliti
es
for
mo
delling
t
yp
e
theory
(Streic
her,
Hyland-Ong-Ritter)
and
strong
normalization.
In
this
pap
er
this
top
os
is
in
v
estigated
from
a
general
logical
and
top
os-
theoretic
p
oin
t
of
view.
It
is
sho
wn
that
Mo
d
(as
w
e
call
the
top
os)
is
the
close
d
c
omplement
of
the
eectiv
e
top
os
inside
another
one;
this
turns
out
to
ha
v
e
some
logical
consequences.
Some
imp
ortan
t
sub
categories
of
Mo
d
are
describ
ed,
and
a
general
logical
principle
is
deriv
ed,
whic
h
holds
in
the
larger
top
os
and
implies
the
w
ell-kno
wn
Indep
endence
of
Premiss
principle.
In
tro
duction.
The
notion
of
\mo
died
realizabilit
y"
originates
with
Kreisel's
[Kre]
(see
also
[Kre]).
While
Kreisel
in
tended
to
giv
e
a
consistency
pro
of
for
the
system
HA
!
and,
accordingly
,
dened
a
straigh
tforw
ard
extension
of
Kleene's
realizabilit
y
to
this
t
yp
ed
system,
to
da
y's
meaning
of
the
term
`mo
di-
ed
realizabilit
y'
deriv
es
from
T
ro
elstra's
collapse
of
this
realizabilit
y
([T
ro]).
Let
me
briey
indicate
what
this
is.
In
Kreisel's
notion,
one
denes
for
eac
h
form
ula
'
of
HA
!
a
t
yp
e

(');
realizers
of
'
ha
v
e
to
b
e
found
in
this
t
yp
e.
F
or
example,

(	x

:')
=



(')
and

('
!
 
)
=

(')
!

( 
).
No
w
it
is
p
ossible
to
in
terpret
the
whole
of
HA
!
in
rst
order
arithmetic
HA,
using
the
mo
del
of
hereditarily
recursiv
e
op
erations.
Then
one
expresses

Basic
Researc
h
in
Computer
Science,
cen
ter
of
the
Danish
National
Researc
h
F
oundation.
P
art
of
the
researc
h
w
as
carried
out
at
the
Departmen
t
of
Mathematics
of
Utrec
h
t
Univ

y
,
The
Netherlands


Kreisel's
realizabilit
y
in
HA,
and
since
HA
is
a
subsystem
of
HA
!
,
one
obtains
another
realizabilit
y
in
terpretation
for
HA,
v
ery
dieren
t
from
Kleene's
one.
The
resulting
in
terpretation
is
form
ulated
with
`p
oten
tial'
and
`actual'
real-
izers;
the
set
of
p
oten
tial
realizers
of
a
form
ula
'
is
the
collapse
of
the
t
yp
e

('),
and
the
actual
realizers
are
a
subset
of
these.
In
the
follo
wing
formal
denition,
U
a
(')
and
U
p
(')
are
the
sets
of,
resp
ectiv
ely
,
the
actual
and
p
oten

realizers
of

and
for
subsets
A;
B

Then
b

the
rst
clause
for
prime
form
ulas:
U
a
(P

=


I
NjP

U
p
(P

=

U

('


U
a
( 
)
U
p
('
^
 
)
=
U
p
(')

U
p
( 
)
U
a
('

=
U

(')
!
U
a
(

U
p

!
U
p

U

U
a

U
p

[fng

U

In
this
denition,
the
in
tersection
in
the
clause
dening
U
a
('

)
reects
Kreisel's
denition
that

('

=

!

(

i.e.
realizers
of
an

m
ust
b
e
glob
al

ts
of
this
function
t
yp
e.
Of
course,
the
clause
is
also
reminiscen
t
of
the
denition
of
in
tuitionistic
implication
in
a
Kripk
e
structure:
'
!
 
is
only
true
in
a
no
de
p

for


p,
if
'
is
true
in

then
 
is
true
in

The

is

due

an
accoun
t
of

based
on
conditional

They
dev
elop
some
theory
,
analogous
to
[Hy],
and
record
the,
at
rst
sigh
t
surprising
fact
that
there
are
two
em
b
eddings
of
Set
in
to
the
mo
died
realizabilit

top
os:
one
is
the
\logical"
one,
dened
from
the
logic
of
the
trip

and
the
other
is
the
direct
image
of
the
em
b
edding
of
Set
as
::-shea
v
es
in
the
top

Among
others,
this
fact
is
accoun
ted
for
in
this
pap

After
setting
up
the
top

I
relate
it
to
the
top

and
sho
w
that
the
mo

called
Mo

is
the
closed

of

.
The
t
w

from

(Streic

A
