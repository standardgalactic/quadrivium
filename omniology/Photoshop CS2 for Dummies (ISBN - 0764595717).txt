Dedication
For my wife — I am continually in awe of all you have accomplished, and all
you continue to accomplish! Your dedication to the law governing armed 
conﬂict makes the world a safer and more civilized place.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I thank Photoshop Hall of Fame member Deke McClelland
for suggesting me for this project. I also thank Matt Wagner (formerly of
Waterside Productions, and now an independent literary agent) and Bob
Woerner of Wiley (the guys who put the deal together) as well as the superb
crew at Wiley that put the book itself together. I would certainly be remiss if I
didn’t give a public thank-you to Stephanie Elder Robey at PhotoSpin.com,
who keeps me so well supplied with high quality images. (You’ll see a number
of PhotoSpin images on these pages.) And I have certainly beneﬁted during
the production of this book from the insights and experiences of those col-
leagues (who must remain nameless) who participated in the development of
this excellent new version of Photoshop. The whole team at Adobe and the
volunteers who risk crashes and lost projects in order to stomp out pre-
release bugs: I salute you!
On a more personal note, there are quite a few folks not directly associated
with the production of this book whose contributions I’d like to acknowledge.
Scott and Kalebra Kelby, Jim Workman and Jean Kendra, Jeff Kelby, and Dave
Moser of the National Association of Photoshop Professionals (NAPP) make
my professional life what it is today. Without them, I’d be just another
techno-geek who knows far too much about a couple of computer programs.
With their support, I’m the Help Desk Director for NAPP — and get to share
all that geek-knowledge with tens of thousands of NAPP members and with
you. I also thank my colleagues, the instructors of the Photoshop World
Dream Team, for always sharing their techniques and experience. I’ve learned
much from each and every one of you. (Okay, well, Julieanne Kost of Adobe
has to move to the top of that list!)
Needless to say, I thank my wife, the incredible Professor Mary Ellen
O’Connell, for her unceasing support through yet another book project.

Photoshop CS2 For Dummies 

Introduction
A
dobe Photoshop is one of the most important computer programs of
our age. It’s made photo editing a commonplace thing, something for
the everyperson. Still, Photoshop can be a scary thing (especially that first
purchase price!), comprising a jungle of menus and palettes and tools and
options and shortcuts as well as a bewildering array of add-ons and plug-ins.
And that’s why you’re holding this book in your hands. And why I wrote it.
And why Wiley published it.
You want to make sense of Photoshop — or, at the very least, be able to work
competently and efficiently in the program, accomplishing those tasks that
need to get done. You want a reference that discusses how things work and
what things do, not in a techno-geek or encyclopedic manner, but rather as
an experienced friend might explain something to you. Although step-by-step
explanations are okay if they show how something works, you don’t need
rote recipes that don’t apply to the work you do. You don’t mind discovering
tricks, as long as they can be applied to your images and artwork in a produc-
tive, meaningful manner. You’re in the right place!
About This Book
If you’re familiar with the For Dummies series, you surely have noticed
already that there’s something, well, different about this book. It looks like a
For Dummies book, but it doesn’t. The cover’s color scheme and the cartoons
are there, but there’s a lot more color. And the layout is, well, not as boxy as
the For Dummies books you’ve seen in the past. Welcome to the new age of
For Dummies!
It’s been quite a collaborative effort over these weeks and months, brain-
storming, discussing, negotiating, finding middle ground — all to present you
with the best possible format for Photoshop CS2 For Dummies. This is a com-
pletely new book, from the ground up. New author, new text, new images,
new layout, new format. New Photoshop, too.
One thing hasn’t changed, though: This book was produced with an eye
toward you and your needs. From Day One, the goal has been to put into
your hands the book that makes Photoshop understandable and useable. You
won’t find a technical explanation of every option for every tool in every 

2
Photoshop CS2 For Dummies 
situation, but rather a concise explanation of those parts of Photoshop you’re
most likely to need. If you happen to be an astrophysicist studying the origins
of the universe, your Photoshop requirements might be substantially more
specific than you’ll find here. (Yes, I do know at least two of those folks —
and I’m sure they bought this book, too.) But for the overwhelming majority
of the people who have access to Adobe Photoshop CS2, this book provides
the background you need to work efficiently and competently with
Photoshop.
As I wrote this book, I intentionally tried to strike a balance between the
types of images with which you are most likely to work and those visually
stimulating (yet far less common) images of unusual subjects from far away
places. At no point in this book does flavor override foundation. When you
need to see a practical example, that’s what I show you. I included a number
of images from PhotoSpin.com, my favorite subscription stock art source.
But, again, I worked to ensure that each piece of artwork illustrates a tech-
nique and does so in a meaningful, nondistracting way for you, the reader.
You’ll see that I used mostly my Apple computers in producing this book.
That’s simply a matter of choice and convenience. Other than the buttons in
the corners of the windows, the modifier keys, and a few choices in terminol-
ogy (such as pop-up menu versus drop-down menu), Photoshop works pretty
much the same on a Mac as it does in Windows. (Okay, well, one other 
difference: I find color management on Apple computers to be much simpler
and more reliable.) You’ll also see (if you look closely) that I shoot mostly
with Canon cameras and use Epson printers. That doesn’t mean that you
shouldn’t shoot with Nikon, Sony, or Fuji, or that you shouldn’t print with HP
or Canon. If that’s what you have, if it’s the equipment with which you’re
comfortable, if it fulfills your needs, stick with it!
One additional note: If you’re brand new to digital imaging and computers,
this probably isn’t the best place to start. I do indeed make certain assump-
tions about your level of computer knowledge (and, to a lesser degree, your
knowledge of digital imaging). But if you know your File➪Open from your
File➪Close and can find your lens cap with both hands, read Chapter 1, and
you’ll have no problem with Photoshop CS2 For Dummies.
How This Book Is Organized
Photoshop CS2 For Dummies is primarily a reference book. As such, you can
check the table of contents or the index for a specific subject, flip to those
pages, and get the information you need. You can also start at the beginning
and read cover to cover (just to make sure you don’t miss a single tip, tech-
nique, or joke). To give you an indication of the type of information in each
chapter, I organized the book into parts. Here’s a quick look at what sort of
content you’ll find in each part.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
The first set of chapters presents the basic operation of Photoshop, what you
need to know to get around in the program, and the core process of getting
images into Photoshop and back out again. If you’re new to digital imaging,
and particularly unfamiliar with Photoshop, make sure to read Chapter 1
through Chapter 3. If you’ve worked with Photoshop or another image editing
program and aren’t quite sure about the concept of resolution or which file
formats are best for which purposes, don’t overlook Chapter 2. Chapter 4 is
the meat and potatoes of Photoshop: scanning and downloading images from
cameras, cropping to fit specific print and frame sizes, and printing or post-
ing your images on the Web. All in one nice, tidy package.
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
In Chapters 5 through 9, you discover ideas and techniques for improving 
the appearance of your images. You read about tonality (the lightness and dark-
ness of the image), color correction (making the image’s color look natural), and
making selections to isolate individual parts of your image for correction. Part II
also includes a full chapter on the Raw file format for digital cameras — what it
is, why it’s important, and how to determine whether it’s right for you. At the
end of this part, I include a chapter on the most common problems in digital
photos (red-eye, wrinkles, and unwanted objects and people). And, yes, that
chapter includes what to do about those problems, too!
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The chapters in Part III take a walk on the creative side. Although not every-
one wants to use Photoshop as a digital painting program, everyone should
understand how to get around in the complex and daunting Brushes palette.
Compositing images (making one picture from two or more), adding text
(whether a simple copyright notice or an entire page), using paths, and
adding layer styles are all valuable skills for just about all folks who work
with Photoshop (even if they don’t consider their work to be art).
Part IV: Power Photoshop
The two chapters in Part IV are more specialized than the rest of the book. If
you don’t work in a production environment (even cropping to the same
dimensions regularly can count as production), you might not need to use
Actions in Photoshop. But there’s far more to Chapter 16 than just Actions
and scripting! It also shows you how you can create an onscreen presentation
that anyone can view, automatically generate a single page with small thumb-
nail images of all your photos, and save paper by printing multiple images on
a single sheet. Chapter 17 is a Web-only chapter. If you don’t create graphics
for the Web, you probably don’t need to read it. However, if you skip it, you
might never see how to create cool little animated movies.

Part V: The Part of Tens
The final part of this book, The Part of Tens, was both the easiest and most
difficult section to prepare. It was easy because, well, the chapters are short.
It was incredibly tough because it’s so hard to narrow any Photoshop-related
list to just ten items. Photoshop is such a beautifully complex and deep pro-
gram that I had a very hard time (as you’ll read) restricting myself to just ten
favorite tips and tricks, just ten bits of hardware and software to make your
work in Photoshop easier, and just ten reasons to own a digital camera. But I
did it (more or less — beware of hidden tips and tricks)!
Conventions Used in This Book
In order to save some space and maintain clarity, I use an arrow symbol as
shorthand for Photoshop menu commands. I could write this:
Move the cursor onto the word Image at the top of your screen and press
the mouse button. Continuing to press the mouse button, move the
cursor downward to the word Adjustments. Still pressing the mouse
button, move the cursor to the right and downward onto the words
Shadow/Highlight. Release the mouse button.
But it makes more sense to write this:
Choose Shadow/Highlight from the Image➪Adjustments menu.
Or even to use this:
Choose the Image➪Adjustments➪Shadow/Highlight command.
You’ll also note that I include keyboard shortcuts (when applicable) for both
Mac and Windows. Generally the shortcuts are together, with Mac always
first, and look like this:
Move the selection to a separate layer with the shortcut
Ô+Shift+J/Ctrl+Shift+J.
The Mac shortcut comes first, with the Windows version following. And, in a
just barely revolutionary step, I assume that some Mac users have discov-
ered the joys of a multibutton mouse. So instead of writing
Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows).

I write this
Right-click (multibutton mouse) or Control-click (single-button mouse).
If you use an Apple computer and haven’t yet tried a multibutton mouse, put
that right on the top of your wish list — it’s a great timesaver.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see icons in the margins as you read this book, icons that indicate
something special. Here, without further ado, is the gallery:
This icon tells you I’m introducing a new feature, something just added to the
program with Photoshop CS2. If you’re brand new to Photoshop yourself, you
can ignore this icon — it’s all new to you. If you’re an experienced Photoshop
user, take note.
When I have a little secret or shortcut to share with you — something that
can make your life easier, smoother, more convenient — you see the Tip icon.
This icon doesn’t appear very often, but when it does, read carefully! I
reserve the Warning icon for those things that can really mess up your day —
things that can cause you to lose work by ruining your file or messing up
Photoshop. If there were to be a quiz afterward, every Warning would be in
the essay section!
The Remember icon shows you good-to-know stuff, things that are applicable
in a number of different places in Photoshop, or things that can make your
Photoshop life easier.
You might notice this icon in a place or two in the book. It’s not common
because I exclude most of the highly technical background info: you know, the
boring techno-geek concepts behind Photoshop. When I do use it, you know
that the material is included to help clarify a complex or important concept.

Photoshop CS2 For Dummies 
How to Use This Book
This is a reference book, not a lesson-based workbook or a tips and tricks
cookbook. When you have a question about how something in Photoshop
works, flip to the table of contents or the index to find your spot. You cer-
tainly can read the chapters in order, cover to cover, to make sure that you
get the most out of it. Nonetheless, keep this book handy while you work in
Photoshop. (Reading cover to cover not only ensures that you find out the
most about Photoshop, but it guarantees that you don’t miss a single cartoon
or joke.)
Unless you’re borrowing a friend’s copy or you checked this book out of the
library, I suggest you get comfortable with the thought of sticky notes and
bent page corners. Photoshop is a very complex program — no one knows
everything about Photoshop. And many concepts and techniques in
Photoshop are hard to remember, especially if you don’t use them often.
Bookmark those pages so they’re easy to find next time because you’re sure
to be coming back time and again to Photoshop CS2 For Dummies.

A
solid understanding of certain basic con-
cepts and techniques makes learning
Photoshop much easier. Heck, it’s difﬁcult to
understand a discussion of feathered selections
when you don’t know your pixels from a hole in
the ground, right?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to Adobe Photoshop.
Chapter 2 focuses on the basic concepts of digital
imaging and offers a look at the primary ﬁle for-
mats in which you save Photoshop images. If
you’re upgrading to CS2, just skim Chapter 3,
which presents the Photoshop interface. If you’re
new to Photoshop or are upgrading from
Photoshop Elements/an earlier version of
Photoshop, though, make sure to read Chapter 3.
Finally, Chapter 4 covers bringing images into
Photoshop from digital cameras or scanners, orga-
nizing those ﬁles, and basic output through
printing or a Web site.

Welcome to Photoshop!

 What Photoshop does very well, kind of well, and just sort of, well . . .
 Taking a look at what you need to know to work with Photoshop
A
dobe Photoshop is, without question, the leading image editing pro-
gram in the world. Photoshop has even become somewhat of a cultural
icon. It’s not uncommon to hear Photoshop used as a verb (“That picture is
obviously Photoshopped!”), and you’ll even see references to Photoshop in
the daily comics and cartoon strips. And now you’re part of this whole gigan-
tic phenomenon called Photoshop.
You might have purchased Photoshop as a new full version, as an upgrade, or
as part of the Adobe Creative Suite. The Creative Suite (that’s where the CS
comes from) comes in two versions. The Standard Edition includes
Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator (for creating vector-based art-
work), and Adobe InDesign (for page layout work). The
Premium Edition also includes Adobe GoLive (for Web
design) and Adobe Acrobat (to create PDF documents).
Whether you’re new to Photoshop, upgrading from
Photoshop CS or earlier, or transitioning from
Elements to the full version of Photoshop, you’re in
for some treats. Photoshop CS2 has some intriguing
new capabilities that enable you to do more, and
more easily, than ever. Before I take you on this jour-
ney through the intricacies of Photoshop, I want to
introduce you to Photoshop in a more general way. In
this chapter, I tell you what Photoshop is designed to do,
what it can do (although not as capably as job-specific soft-
ware), and what you can get it to do if you try really, really hard.
I also review some basic computer operation concepts, and point out a
couple of places where Photoshop is a little different than most other pro-
grams. At the end of the chapter, I have a few tips for you on installing
Photoshop to ensure it runs properly.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Exploring Adobe Photoshop
Photoshop is used for an incredible range of projects, ranging from editing
and correcting digital photos to preparing images for magazines and newspa-
pers to creating graphics for the Web. You’ll also find Photoshop in the foren-
sics departments of law enforcement agencies, scientific labs and research
facilities, and dental and medical offices, as well as in classrooms, offices, stu-
dios, and homes around the world. As the Help Desk Director for the National
Association of Photoshop Professionals (NAPP), I solve problems and pro-
vide solutions for Photoshop users from every corner of the computer graph-
ics field and from every corner of the world. People are doing some pretty
amazing things with Photoshop, many of which are so far from the program’s
original roots that it boggles the mind!
What Photoshop is designed to do
Adobe Photoshop is an image editing program. It is designed to help you edit
images, digital or digitized images, photographs, and otherwise. This is the
core purpose of Photoshop. Over the years, Photoshop has grown and devel-
oped, adding features that supplement its basic operations. But at its heart,
Photoshop is an image editor. At its most basic, Photoshop’s workflow goes
something like this: You take a picture, you edit the picture, and you print the
picture (as illustrated in Figure 1-1).
Figure 1-1: Basic Photoshop: take photo, edit photo, print photo. Drink coffee (optional).
Whether captured with a digital camera, scanned into the computer, or cre-
ated from scratch in Photoshop, your artwork consists of tiny squares of
color, which are picture elements called pixels. (Pixels and the nature of digi-
tal imaging are explored in depth in Chapter 2.) Photoshop is all about chang-
ing and adjusting the colors of those pixels — collectively, in groups, or one
at a time — in order to make your artwork look precisely how you want it to
look. (Photoshop, by the way, has no Good Taste or Quality Art filter. It’s up to

you to decide what suits your artistic or personal vision and what meets your
professional requirements.) Some very common Photoshop image editing
tasks are shown in Figure 1-2: namely, correcting red-eye and minimizing wrin-
kles (both discussed in Chapter 9); and compositing images (see Chapter 10).

Figure 1-2: Some common Photoshop tasks.
Over the past few updates, Photoshop has developed some rather powerful
illustration capabilities to go with its digital imaging power. Although
Photoshop is still no substitute for Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop certainly
can serve you well for smaller illustration projects. (Keep in mind that
Photoshop is a raster art program — it works with pixels — and vector art-
work is only simulated in Photoshop.) Photoshop also has a very capable
brush engine, which makes it feasible to paint efficiently on your digital
canvas. Figure 1-3 shows a comparison of raster artwork (the digital photo,
left), vector artwork (the illustration, center), and digital painting (right). The
three types of artwork can appear in a single image, too. (Simulating vector
artwork with Photoshop’s shape layers is presented in Chapter 11, and you
can read about painting with Photoshop in Chapter 14.)

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
By using ImageReady, the partner program to Photoshop (installed with
Photoshop into the same Photoshop folder), you can create advanced Web
graphics, such as rollover buttons and animations (see Chapter 17).
Photoshop even includes special features to help you create an entire Web
site to display your artwork (Web Photo Gallery), and a feature to prepare
onscreen presentations, complete with transition effects between slides (PDF
Presentation). (Read about Web Photo Gallery in Chapter 4 and PDF
Presentation in Chapter 16.)
Other things you can do with Photoshop
Although Photoshop is not a page layout or illustration program, you cer-
tainly can produce simple brochures, posters, greeting cards, and the like
using only Photoshop. (See Figure 1-4.) One of the features that sets
Photoshop apart from basic image editors is its powerful type engine, which
can add, edit, format, and stylize text as capably as many word processing
programs. Photoshop even has a spell check feature — not bad for a program
that’s designed to work with photos, eh?
Figure 1-4: You can use Photoshop to create cards, posters, and brochures.

Photoshop CS2 takes yet another giant step toward filling in for InDesign or
Illustrator with the introduction of Smart Objects. Smart Objects can be cre-
ated in Photoshop through the Layers palette or pasted into your artwork
from Illustrator. A Smart Object is a designer’s dream. You add the Smart
Object to your project; then, you can edit the original file and have the Smart
Object updated to match. For example, suppose you add a sponsor logo to a
poster as a Smart Object, and then use that same Smart Object in a direct-
mail piece, a flyer, a magazine ad, and a couple of other related projects. Just
before the approval date for the project, however, the sponsor drops out and
is replaced by a new sponsor. You simply change the original file from which
you created the Smart Object and then update the various instances of the
Smart Object in your various projects. Done! Not only is this approach faster
than manually changing each instance of the logo, but it ensures accuracy.
Each Smart Object retains any effects you’ve applied, but those effects are
applied to the updated artwork.
On the subject of special effects,
Photoshop CS2 also introduces
object warping, which you use to
bend and twist elements in your art-
work. As Photoshop moves more
toward an object-based interface, it
provides you with more ways to
work with the content of a layer as a
single unit rather than as indepen-
dent pixels. Sure, you can still work
with pixels, but treating a layer as an
object certainly can be convenient.
Take a look at Figure 1-5. Using a
warp mesh to manipulate the art-
work makes short work of what
would otherwise have been a diffi-
cult edit. Click and drag an intersec-
tion within the mesh to reform the
shape.
You can certainly supplement your video editing program with Photoshop
(even if Photoshop can’t open and play movies you capture with your video
camera). From Adobe Premiere (or other professional video programs), you
can export a series of frames in the FilmStrip format, which you can open and
edit in Photoshop. Photoshop even provides support for nonsquare pixels,
just in case you find yourself developing a project for television. You can
create new documents that use nonsquare pixels and, through Photoshop’s
View menu, work on them as if they were regular old square-pixel digital
images. No more “guesstimating” distortion factors or trying to calculate
what is round or square in the artwork.

faster than selecting and moving pixels.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
When you install Photoshop CS2, you also install a separate program named
Adobe Bridge. (Unlike ImageReady, Bridge isn’t inside the Photoshop folder.)
Bridge is a standalone version of the File Browser from the previous version
of Photoshop. As an asset management tool, it’s even more capable. And
because it’s a separate program, it can be used throughout the Adobe
Creative Suite or even independently to organize your images and artwork.
(Figure 1-6 shows Adobe Bridge.) See Chapter 4 for more on Adobe Bridge.
Figure 1-6: Use Adobe Bridge to manage your collection of images and artwork.
If you don’t have specialized software
Admittedly, Photoshop CS2 just plain can’t do some things. It won’t make you
a good cup of coffee. It can’t press your trousers. It doesn’t vacuum under the
couch. It isn’t even a substitute for iTunes, Microsoft Excel, or Netscape
Navigator — it just doesn’t do those things.
However, there are a number of things for which Photoshop isn’t designed
that you can do in a pinch. If you don’t have InDesign, you can still lay out the
pages of a newsletter, magazine, or even a book, one page at a time. (With
PDF Presentation, you can even generate a multipage PDF document from
your individual pages.) If you don’t have GoLive, you can use Photoshop to
create a Web site, again one page at a time, complete with rollover buttons,

image maps for links, and anima-
tions. You also have tools that simu-
late 3-D in Photoshop.
Page layout in Photoshop isn’t par-
ticularly difficult for a one-page 
piece or even a trifold brochure.
Photoshop has a quite-capable type
engine, considering the program is
designed to push pixels rather than
play with paragraphs. And, for the
first time, Photoshop shows you a
sample of each typeface in the Font
menu — no more trying to remem-
ber which fonts are which! Choose from three sizes of preview in Photoshop’s
Preferences (as shown in Figure 1-7). However, you can’t link Photoshop’s
type containers, so a substantial addition or subtraction at the top of the first
column requires manually recomposing all following columns. After all, the
biggest advantages of a dedicated page layout program are the continuity
(using a master page or layout) and flow from page to page. If you work with
layout regularly, use InDesign CS2.
Adobe GoLive CS2 is a state-of-the-art Web design tool, whose interoperabil-
ity with Photoshop is exquisite. It’s a piece of cake to use Photoshop and
ImageReady to create complex Web graphics, including rollover buttons (but-
tons that change appearance when clicked) and animations, and then drop
those PSD files right into a GoLive Web page. (Read about creating complex
Web graphics in Chapter 17.) However, if you don’t have GoLive and you des-
perately need to create a Web page, Photoshop comes to your rescue. After
laying out your page and creating your slices, links, and rollovers in
ImageReady, use the Save Optimized As command to generate an HTML doc-
ument (your Web page) and a folder filled with the images that form the page
(see Figure 1-8). One of the advantages to creating a Web page in GoLive
rather than Photoshop is HTML text. (Using Photoshop and ImageReady, all
the text on your Web pages is saved as graphic files. HTML text not only pro-
duces smaller Web pages for faster download, but it’s resizable in the Web
browser.)
Although Photoshop doesn’t actually work in three dimensions (digital
images have width and height, but not depth), you can use it in conjunction
with your 3-D software. In addition to creating textures, Photoshop now
includes the very powerful Vanishing Point feature, which lets you map art-
work onto simulated 3-D surfaces. (Read about Vanishing Point in Chapter 10.)

Viewing Photoshop’s Parts and Processes
In many respects, Photoshop CS2 is just another computer program — you
launch the program, open files, save files, and quit the program quite nor-
mally. Many common functions have common keyboard shortcuts. You
enlarge, shrink, minimize, and close windows as you do in other programs.
Reviewing basic computer operations
Chapter 3 looks at Photoshop-specific aspects of working with floating
palettes, menus and submenus, and tools from the Options bar, but I want to
take just a little time to review some fundamental computer concepts.
Launching Photoshop
You can launch Photoshop (start the
program) by double-clicking an
image file or through the
Applications folder (Mac) or the
Start menu (Windows) — and Mac
users can drag the Photoshop pro-
gram icon (the actual program itself)
to the Dock to make it available for
one-click startup. Figure 1-9 shows
both the Dock and the Start menu.
You’ll find the file named Adobe
Photoshop CS2 inside the Adobe
Photoshop CS2 folder, inside the
main Applications folder. You can
open a file in ImageReady either by
launching the program directly or by
Figure 1-9: Start Photoshop through the Start
menu (Windows) or the Dock (Mac).

clicking the button at the bottom of the Toolbox in Photoshop. (Chapter 3
shows you the Photoshop interface and how to get around in the program.)
Never open an image into Photoshop from removable media (CD, DVD, your
digital camera or its Flash card, Zip disks, jump drives, and the like) or from a
network drive. Always copy the file to a local hard drive, open from that
drive, save back to the drive, and then copy the file to its next destination.
You can open from internal hard drives or external hard drives, but to avoid
losing your work (or the entire image file) because of a problem reading from
or writing to removable media, always copy to a local hard drive.
Working with images
Within Photoshop, you work with individual image files. Each image is
recorded on the hard drive in a specific file format. Photoshop opens just
about any image consisting of pixels as well as some file formats that do not.
(File formats are discussed in Chapter 2.) Remember that to change a file’s
format, you open the file in Photoshop and use the Save As command to
create a new file. And, although theoretically not always necessary on the
Mac, I suggest that you always include the file extension at the end of the file-
name. If Photoshop won’t open an image, it might be in a file format that
Photoshop can’t read. It cannot, for example, open an Excel spreadsheet or a
Microsoft Word DOC file because those are not image formats — and
Photoshop is, as you know, an image editing program. If you have a brand
new digital camera and Photoshop won’t open its Raw images, check for an
update to the Adobe Camera Raw plug-in at
www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html
You will also find installation instructions for the update there.
Saving your files
You must use the Save or Save As command to preserve changes to your
images. And after you save and close an image, those changes are irre-
versible. When working with an important image, consider these two tips:
 Work on a copy of the image file. Unless you’re working with a digital
photo in the Raw format (discussed in Chapter 7), make a copy of your
image file as a backup before changing it in Photoshop. That ensures
that should something go horribly wrong, you can start over. (You never
actually change a Raw photo — Photoshop can’t rewrite the original 
file — so you are always, in effect, working on a copy.)
 Save your work as PSD, too. Especially if your image has layers, save it
in Photoshop’s PSD file format (complete with all the layers) before
using Save As to create a final copy in another format. If you don’t save a
copy with layers, going back to make one little change can cost hours of
work.
17
Chapter 1: Welcome to Photoshop!

18
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
If you attempt to close an image or quit
Photoshop without saving your work first, you
will get a gentle reminder asking whether you
want to save, close without saving, or cancel
the close/quit (as shown in Figure 1-10).
Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts are customizable in
Photoshop (check out Chapter 3), but some of
the basic shortcuts are the same as those you
use in other programs. You open, copy, paste,
save, close, and quit just as you do in Microsoft
Word, your e-mail program, and just about any
other software. I suggest that you keep these shortcuts unchanged, even if
you do some other shortcut customization.
Photoshop’s incredible selective Undo
Here is one major difference between Photoshop and other programs you
use. Almost all programs have some form of Undo, enabling you to reverse
the most recent command or action (or mistake). Like many programs,
Photoshop uses the Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z shortcut for Undo/Redo (but remember that
you can change the shortcut, as described in Chapter 3). Photoshop also has,
however, a couple of great features that let you partially undo.
Painting to undo with the History Brush
You can use the Photoshop History Brush to partially undo just about any
filter, adjustment, or tool by painting. You select the History Brush, choose a
history state (a stage in the image development) to which you want to revert,
and then paint over areas of the image that you want to change back to the
earlier state.
You can undo as far back in the editing process as you want, with a couple of
limitations: The History palette (where you select the state to which you
want to revert) holds only a limited number of history states. In the
Photoshop Preferences➪General pane, you specify how many states you
want Photoshop to remember (to a maximum of 1,000). Keep in mind that
storing lots of history states takes up computer memory that you might need
for processing filters and adjustments. That can slow things down. The
default of 20 history states is good for most projects, but when using painting
tools or other procedures that involve lots of repetitive steps, a larger
number (perhaps as many as 60) is generally a better idea.
The second limitation is pixel dimensions. If you make changes to the image’s
actual size (in pixels) with the Crop tool or the Image Size or Canvas Size
commands, you cannot revert to prior steps with the History Brush. You can
Figure 1-10: Photoshop reminds
you if you haven’t saved changes
to an image.

choose as a source any history state
that comes after the image’s pixel
dimensions changed but none that
come before.
Here’s one example of using the
History Brush as a creative tool. You
open a photograph in Photoshop.
You desaturate the image to make it
appear to be grayscale, which gives
it the appearance of a black-and-
white photo. In the History palette,
you click in the left column next to
the Open step to designate that as
the source state, the appearance of
the image to which you want to revert. You select the History Brush and
paint over your eyes, lips, and hair, restoring them to the original (color)
appearance (see Figure 1-11). There you have it — a grayscale image with a
couple of areas of color, compliments of the History Brush!
Reducing to undo with the Fade command
Immediately after applying a filter or adjustment or using most of
Photoshop’s tools, you can choose the Edit➪Fade command and change the
opacity or blending mode with which the previous step was performed. You
might, for example,
apply a sharpening
filter and then use the
Edit➪
Fade Unsharp Mask
command to change
the blending mode
from Normal to
Luminosity.
(Sharpening only the
luminosity of your
image, whether with
this technique or in
the L*a*b color mode,
prevents unwanted
color shifts along
edges in your images.
Color modes are dis-
cussed in Chapter 6.)
Or you might apply the
Motion Blur filter and
then use Edit➪Fade
Motion Blur (yes, the
name of the command

actually changes for you) to reduce the opacity of the blur to 75%. That gives
you the appearance of a back-and-forth motion while leaving the subject rec-
ognizable (see Figure 1-12).
Installing Photoshop: Need to know
If you haven’t yet installed Photoshop CS2 (or the Adobe Creative Suite), here
are a few points to keep in mind:
 Install only into the default location. Photoshop is a resource-intensive
program. Installing it into the default location (Applications on a
Mac/Program Files for Windows, as shown in Figure 1-13) ensures that it
has access to the operating system and hardware as necessary.
Installing into any other location or attempting to run Photoshop across
a network can lead to frustrating problems and loss of work in progress.
Figure 1-13: Install into the default location to avoid future problems.
 Disable all antivirus software before installing. Antivirus software can
intercept certain installation procedures, deeming them to be hazardous
to your computer’s health. That can lead to malfunctions, crashes, lost
work, frustration, and what I like to call Computer Flying across the
Room Syndrome. If you use antivirus software (and if you’re on
Windows, you’d better!), turn it off before installing any program, espe-
cially one as complex as Photoshop. You might find the antivirus pro-
gram’s icon in the Windows taskbar; or you might need to go to the Start
menu, use All Programs to locate the antivirus software, and disable it.
On Mac, check the Dock. And don’t forget to restart your antivirus soft-
ware afterward! If you already installed Photoshop and antivirus soft-
ware was running at the time, I urge you to uninstall and reinstall. (On
Mac, drag the Adobe Photoshop CS2 folder from the Applications folder
to the Trash and empty the Trash. On Windows, choose Start➪
Control Panel➪Add/Remove Programs.)

 If you use auto-backup software, shut it down, too. Never run auto-
backup software when installing software. Like antivirus software, it can
also lead to problems by interfering with the installer.
 Connect to the Internet and activate right away. It’s best to run the
Photoshop installer while your computer is connected to the Internet.
That enables Photoshop’s activation process to happen right away,
making sure you can get started as soon as the installer finishes.
 If you have third-party plug-ins, install them elsewhere. Third-party
plug-ins — those filters and other Photoshop add-ons that you buy from
companies other than Adobe — can be installed into a folder outside the
Photoshop folder. You can then make an alias (Mac) or shortcut
(Windows) to that folder and drag the alias/shortcut to Photoshop’s
Plug-Ins folder. (If you have a multibutton mouse, right-click the folder to
create an alias/shortcut; Control-click if you’re still using a one-button
mouse.) Why install outside the Photoshop folder? Should you ever
need to (gasp!) reinstall Photoshop, you won’t need to reinstall all your
third-party plug-ins. Just create a new alias/shortcut and move it into
Photoshop’s new Plug-Ins folder.
 If you have lots of plug-ins, create sets. Plug-ins require RAM (computer
memory that Photoshop uses to process your editing commands). If you
have lots of plug-ins, consider dividing them into groups according to
how and when you use them. Sort (or install) them into separate folders.
(Hint: Plug-ins that you use in many situations can be installed into mul-
tiple folders.) When you need to load a specific set, do so through
Photoshop’s Preferences➪Plug-Ins & Scratch Disks pane by designating
a second plug-ins folder and relaunching Photoshop.
 If you love fonts, use a font management utility. If you have hundreds
of fonts (over the years, I’ve somehow managed to collect upward of
3,000 fonts), use a font management utility to create sets of fonts accord-
ing to style and only activate those sets that you need at any given time.
The Mac OS has Font Book built right in, and Windows users might want
to take a look at Suitcase (www.extensis.com). Too many active fonts
can choke Photoshop’s type engine, slowing performance.

n the early days of photography, some less-advanced cultures viewed a
photo with great suspicion, and even fear. Was that an actual person,
trapped in the paper? Did taking a photo steal a person’s soul? We know that
a camera doesn’t trap anyone inside the paper — and we’re pretty sure about
the stolen soul issue — but how much does the average shooter know
about digital images? And how much do you need to know about
digital images to work effectively in Photoshop?
The answers to those two questions are “Not as much
as he/she should” and “Not as much as you might
fear.” In this chapter, I give you some basic informa-
tion about how digital images exist in Photoshop, a
real understanding of that critical term resolution,
and an overview of the different ways that you can
save your images. But most importantly, I help you
understand the very nature of digital images by
explaining the world of pixels.
Welcome to the Philosophy Chapter!

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
What Exactly Is a Digital Image?
Whether you take a picture with a digital camera or use a scanner to bring a
photo (or other artwork) into Photoshop, you are digitizing the image. That is,
digit not as in a finger or toe but as in a number. Computers do everything —
absolutely everything — by processing numbers, and the basic language of
computers is binary code. Whether it’s a photo of a Tahitian sunset, a client’s
name in a database, or the latest box score on the Internet, your computer
works on it in binary code. In a nutshell, binary code uses a series of zeros
and ones (that’s where the numbers part comes into play) to record informa-
tion. (In Photoshop, this is a critical concept for color, as you can see in
Chapter 6.) Binary code might look like this:
00100101 01010011 00011011 11010100 11101000 11000110
10101001 10010011 11010101 01011010 00101100 11101110
This example, of course, would be complete gibberish to a computer — if
those two lines turn out to be the launch code for some missile, it’s just a
coincidence.
So what does binary code have to do
with the wedding photos that you
took this weekend or the master-
piece you must print for your thesis
project? An image in Photoshop con-
sists of tiny squares of color called
pixels (short for picture element), as
you can see in the close-up to the right
in Figure 2-1. Each pixel is recorded
and processed by the computer in
binary code. These pixels replicate a
photo the same way that tiles in a
mosaic reproduce a painting.
A tile in a mosaic isn’t face or sky or
grass; rather, it’s beige or blue or green. The tiles individually have no rela-
tionship to the image as a whole; rather, they require an association with the
surrounding tiles to give them purpose, to make them part of the picture.
Without the rest of the tiles, a single tile has no meaning.
Likewise, a single pixel in a digital image is simply a square of color. It doesn’t
become a meaningful part of your digital image until it’s surrounded by other
pixels of the same or different color, creating a unified whole — a comprehen-
sible picture. How you manipulate those pixels, from the time you capture
the image digitally until you output the image to paper or the Web, deter-
mines how successfully your pixels will represent your image, your artwork,
your dream.
Figure 2-1: That’s not really an ugly old dog;
it’s a bunch of tiny colored squares.

The True Nature of Pixels
Here are some basic truths about pixels that you really need to know.
Although reading this next section probably won’t improve your love life, let
you speak to the dead, or give you the winning lottery number, it will help
you understand what’s happening to your image as you work with it in
Photoshop.
 Each pixel can be exactly one color. That
color can change as you edit or alter the
image, but each pixel consists entirely of a
single color — there’s no such thing as a
two-tone pixel. Figure 2-2, at 1600% zoom,
shows each pixel distinctly.
 Each pixel is independent. You might
think that you see a car or a circle or a tree
or Uncle Bob in an image, but the image
is actually only a bunch of little colored
squares. Although you can read about 
various ways to work with groups of pixels
throughout this book, each pixel exists
unto itself.
 Each pixel is square (except on TV).
Really! Each pixel in a digital image is
square except when creating images for
television, which uses nonsquare pixels.
(That’s a rather specialized field, which I
very briefly address in Chapter 3.) It’s
important that you understand the squareness (totally, like L7, Daddy-O)
of pixels because you sometimes have to deal with those pointy little
corners.
 Smaller is better (generally speaking). The smaller each pixel, the
better the detail in an image. (However, when preparing images for the
Web, you need smaller images that invariably have less detail.) If you
capture an image of a dog in a park with two million pixels and capture
the same shot with only 30,000 pixels, it’s pretty obvious which image
will better show the individual blades of grass and the fur. Take a look at
Figure 2-3 for an example of this critical concept.
Smaller pixels also help hide those nasty corners of pixels that are some-
times visible along curves and diagonal lines. When the corners of pixels
are noticeable and degrade the image, you call it a bad case of the jaggies.
25
Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
Figure 2-2: Each pixel is
monotone, containing a single
color throughout the pixel.

26
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Figure 2-3: More pixels (top) means better detail.
 Pixels are aligned in a raster. The term raster appears regularly when
you discuss images created from pixels. Raster, in this case, refers to the
nice orderly rows and columns in which pixels appear. Each image has a
certain number of rows of pixels, and each row is a certain number of
pixels wide — the columns. Within the raster, the pixels perfectly align
side-to-side and top-to-bottom.
 Every picture created with pixels is rectangular. Some images might
appear to be round, or star-shaped, or have a hole cut from the middle,
but they don’t unless you print them out and grab your scissors. The
image file itself is rectangular, even if it appears round. There are actu-
ally pixels in those seemingly empty areas; the pixels are, however,
transparent.

How Many Pixels Can Dance 
on the Head of a Pin?
You hear the term resolution a lot when working with digital images. (And you
see it, too, like the examples in Figure 2-4). Digital cameras have so-many
megapixels of resolution; inkjet printers have so-much by so-much resolution;
to work in Photoshop CS2, your monitor must have a resolution of at least
1024 x 768 pixels; you must scan your line art at a very high resolution; when
printing your images, you must use 300 pixels per inch (ppi) as your resolu-
tion (wrong!), but your Web images must have a resolution of 72 ppi (again
wrong!); and don’t forget your New Year’s resolution!
Figure 2-4: Resolution to the left of me, resolution to the right of me. . . .
What are all these resolutions, and what do they have to do with you?

Resolution revelations
In this wonderful world of digital imaging, you see resolution used in four
basic ways:
 Image resolution: Image resolution is the size of your image’s individual
pixels when you print. I go into greater detail about this concept later in
the upcoming section, “Picking an image resolution.”
 Camera resolution: Digital cameras capture each image in a specific
number of pixels. Check your camera’s user guide or open one of the
images in Photoshop and go to Image➪Image Size. Take a look at the
number of pixels that your camera records for the width and for the
height. Multiply the numbers together, divide by one million, and round
off the result. (If you’re in the camera maker’s marketing department,
make sure that you round up.) That’s the megapixel (MP) rating for the
camera. Use it as a general guideline when shopping. If you create Web
graphics or snapshot-size prints, 3 or 4 megapixels is fine. For large
prints, you need at least 6 megapixels.
 Monitor resolution: Monitor resolution determines how many pixels are
visible onscreen. Whether you use a Mac or a PC, you set the monitor
resolution at the system level, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5: Set a Mac’s resolution through the System Preferences (left), a PC’s resolution
through the Control Panel (right).
• Mac: On a Mac, click the blue Apple menu in the upper-left corner
of the screen and choose System Preferences. Then click Displays.
(Some Apple monitors have a button on the bezel that automati-
cally opens the window for you.) When you use a higher monitor
resolution, you get a larger workspace, but each pixel is smaller,
which might make some jobs tougher. Experiment to find a monitor
resolution that works just right for you.

• Windows: Go to Start➪Control Panel and then double-click
Display. Click the Settings tab to see what monitor resolutions are
available.
 Printer resolution: Unlike the three preceding terms, printer resolution
doesn’t involve pixels. Rather, a printer’s resolution tells you how many
tiny droplets of ink are sprayed on the paper. Remember that it takes
several droplets to reproduce a single image pixel — you certainly don’t
need an image resolution anywhere close to the printer’s resolution!
(See the following section for more on this.)
Resolving image 
resolution
Image resolution is nothing more
than an instruction to a printing
device about how large to reproduce
each pixel. Onscreen, when working
in Photoshop, your image has no res-
olution at all. An image that’s 3000
pixels wide and 2000 pixels tall looks
and acts exactly the same in
Photoshop whether you’ve got the
image resolution at 300 ppi or 72 ppi.
Same number of pixels, right?
You can always check — or change —
a picture’s resolution by using the
Photoshop Image➪Image Size com-
mand. The Image Size dialog box
(which you can see in Figure 2-6) 
has two separate but related sets of
information about your image. At 
the top, you see information about
the actual image itself, in the Pixel
Dimensions area. Below, in the
Document Size area, you see instructions for a printing device — that “size”
pertains only to printing and has no impact on what you do in Photoshop.
You’ll find it very handy to change the pixel dimensions and the print size at
the same time in the Image Size dialog box. And, much to the delight of the
math-challenged among us, Image Size does most of the calculations for you.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Changing the size of your artwork with Image Size
You have a number of ways to
change the size of your photos and
other art. In Chapter 4, I introduce
you to cropping (chopping off part of
the artwork to make it fit a certain
size or to improve its overall appear-
ance and impact). You can use
Photoshop’s Image Size command 
to change the image dimensions (or
printing instructions) without alter-
ing the composition (the visual
arrangement of the image or art-
work). All the content of the original
image is there, just at a different 
size. Of course, as you can see in
Figure 2-7, if you reduce the size 
of an image too much, some of that original content can become virtually 
unrecognizable.
If you know the specific pixel dimen-
sions that you need for the final
image — say for a Web page — you
can simply type a new number in one
of the upper fields in the Image Size
dialog box and click OK. In most
cases, you select all three check
boxes at the bottom of the dialog box,
enter your desired print width or
height (letting Photoshop calculate
the other dimension), enter your
desired print resolution, and click OK.
Of course, you probably want a little
more control over the process, don’t
you? Figure 2-8 gives you a closer 
look at the Image Size dialog box.
In the lower part of the Image Size
dialog box, you have three decisions to make. The first is rather easy: If
you’re resizing an image that uses layer styles (see Chapter 12), you want to
mark the Scale Styles check box to preserve the image’s appearance as it
shrinks or grows. In a nutshell, layer styles (such as shadows, glows, and
bevels) are applied to a layer at a specific size. You can scale the image with-
out changing those sizes or you can scale the image and change the style
sizes proportionally. Not scaling layer styles can dramatically alter the
appearance of a resized image, as you can see in Figure 2-9. A slight bevel
combined with a small drop shadow produces a subtle 3-D effect in the
Figure 2-8: Your choices can have a
substantial impact on the appearance of your
final image.
Figure 2-7: As the smaller image shows,
reducing an image too much isn’t good.

original (upper). Below, when the image is scaled down to one-fourth the
original size without scaling the effects, your chips change to chumps, and
the artwork is ruined.
Figure 2-9: Scaling an image without scaling its layer styles can ruin your image.
The middle check box, Constrain
Proportions, should almost always
remain checked. There might be
some exceptions, but you normally
want to preserve an image’s aspect
ratio (the relationship between
height and width) when resizing to
prevent distorting the image.
Figure 2-10 shows you what can
happen when you scale one dimen-
sion without constraining the
image’s proportions.
The third check box, Resample
Image, is the one that most often
requires the attention of that gray matter within your skull. Not only do you
need to decide whether you want to resample the image (change its pixel
dimensions), but you also need to decide how you want to resample. Refer to
Figure 2-8 to see that you have five different ways to calculate the change
(called resampling algorithms).
31
Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
Figure 2-10: Resizing an image without
constraining proportions. Interesting, yes, but
useful?

32
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Before I talk about those choices, let me explain what happens when the
Resample Image box is left unchecked. The top portion of the Image Size
dialog box becomes unavailable — you can no longer make changes in the
Pixel Dimension fields (as you see in Figure 2-11). The information is there,
but it won’t change. When you clear the Resample Image check box, you pro-
tect the original pixels, preventing any change to the image itself.
Figure 2-11: Clear the Resample Image check box to change print size, not pixel dimensions.
So what’s left? When using Image Size without resampling, you’re simply
changing the instructions recorded in the image for your printing device.
When you enter one dimension, either width or height, Photoshop does the
math and fills in both the other dimension and the new resolution. Or, if
you’d like, you could change the Resolution field and have Photoshop recal-
culate the print dimensions although it generally makes more sense to spec-
ify a desired print size.
Take a look at Figure 2-12. I cleared the Resample Image check box and
entered 10 and inches for my new print width in order to print this image to a
letter-size (8.5" x 11") sheet of paper. Photoshop fills in the new height (6.667
inches) and a new resolution (307.2 ppi). But what if I want an 8 x 10 print? If I
enter 8 and inches for the height, Photoshop recalculates the width to 12
inches (and enters a resolution of 256 ppi). If I want a true 8 x 10, I have to
crop some of the image because a digital photo and an 8 x 10 have different
aspect ratios. (You can read more about that in Chapter 4.)
Okay, then, back to the subject of resampling! When you resample an image
(change the pixel dimensions), Photoshop takes the image and maps it to the
new size, attempting to preserve the image’s appearances as much as possi-
ble at the new size, using the new number of pixels. Of course, if you take an
image that’s more than 3000 pixels wide and resample it to 300 pixels wide,
you’re going to lose some of the detail. (Remember what happened to Hugo
the Bulldog earlier in this chapter in Figure 2-3!)

Figure 2-12: Enter a value, and Photoshop recalculates the fields automatically.
33
Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
To resample or to crop: That is the question
In order to better understand the difference between
resampling an image and cropping an image, con-
sider this situation:
1. A painter paints a picture. He or she paints it at
whatever size he or she thinks is appropriate. (Or,
perhaps, on the only piece of canvas he or she
can afford on that particular day.)
2. A patron likes the artwork, but the painting is
too large for the frame that works best with the
dining room table. Yeah, patrons can be like that,
can’t they?
3. The patron asks the artist to make the painting
fit the frame.
4. The artist decides between cropping and resam-
pling. He or she can grab a pair of scissors and
cut off some of the painting (cropping) or the
artist can re-create the painting from scratch at
a smaller size, repainting the scene. Thankfully,
Photoshop does the “repainting” for us, using
Image Size with its resampling algorithms.
5. The artist charges the patron for the extra work.
(Let’s not forget this final, crucial step!)
Cropping cuts away part of the image to meet a target size. Resampling retains all the image but
shrinks or enlarges it to meet the target size.

34
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Choosing a resampling method
After you decide to change the pixel dimensions of your image via the Image
Size command, you need to select one of the five resampling algorithms (take
another peek at Figure 2-8). Table 2-1 sums up my advice on choosing the
right one.
If you’ll be resizing a number of images in the same way, either upsampling or
downsampling, open Photoshop’s Preferences➪General and select the opti-
mal resampling method in the Image Interpolation menu. That algorithm then
becomes the default in Image Size, saving you the trouble of changing the
algorithm each time.
Keep in mind that the resampling method that you select in the Preferences
is also used for the Edit➪Transform commands, which you use to scale,
rotate, and otherwise alter individual elements within your artwork. (You can
read about the Transform commands in Chapter 10.)

Picking an image resolution
After you have resampling under
your belt, how do you know what
size you should be resampling to?
How many pixels do you need? Here
are your general guidelines:
 Photos for your inkjet printer:
Inkjet printers are stochastic
printing devices: That is, they
use a series of droplets to repli-
cate each pixel in your image, 
as shown in Figure 2-13. In
theory, the optimal image reso-
lution is one-third of the printer’s rated resolution. For example, a
printer rated at 720 ppi works best with images at 240 ppi. For a 1440 ppi
printer, the formula calls for an image resolution of 480 ppi (and that
goes for the 2880 x 1440 printers, too). However, most folks find that
regardless of the printer’s rating, they never need an image resolution
higher than 300 ppi.
 Web images: Ignore resolution. Ignore the entire Document Size area of
the Image Size dialog box. Consider only the image’s pixel dimensions.
Determine what area of the Web page the image will occupy and then
resize to exactly those pixel dimensions.
 Page layout programs and commercial printing: If your image is to be
placed into a page layout program’s document and sent to a commercial
printing facility, you need to know the line screen frequency (the resolu-
tion, so to speak) of the printing press on which the job will be run. Ask
the print shop or the person handling the page layout. Your image reso-
lution should be either exactly 1.5 times or exactly twice the line screen
frequency, either one. (You shouldn’t notice any difference in the final
printed product with either resolution.)
 PowerPoint presentations and word processing documents: Generally
speaking, 72 ppi is appropriate for images that you place into a presenta-
tion or Word document. You should resize to the exact dimensions of the
area on the page or slide that the image fills.
Sometimes resampling an image to 300 ppi does more harm than good. You
might get a better print at the image’s original resolution than you will at 
the higher resolution after resampling. If your image’s original resolution is
240 ppi or more, consider printing at that resolution rather than upsampling
to 300 ppi. When in doubt, work on a copy of your image so that you can
return to the original if necessary.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
File Formats: Which Do You Need?
After working with your image in
Photoshop, you need to save the
changes. Using the File➪Save com-
mand updates the current file on
your hard drive, maintaining the cur-
rent file format when possible. If you
added some feature to the file that 
is not supported by the original file
format, Photoshop automatically
opens the Save As dialog box and
shows you which features are not
supported by the selected file
format. In Figure 2-14, the lower part of the Save As dialog box shows you the
yellow warning triangles that identify options being used in the image that
are not available when saving as a JPEG.
You can go ahead and save the image in that format, but your file will no
longer contain those unsupported features. In the example shown in Figure
2-14, I can click the Save button and create a JPEG file, but that JPEG won’t have the
alpha channel (a saved selection), the spot channel (a custom printing color), or
the annotations (sort of electronic sticky notes you add to images with the Notes
and Audio Annotation tools); and it will be flattened to a single layer. If I want to
retain those features in the file, I need to choose a different file format, such as
Photoshop’s own PSD format. (Read more about alpha channels in Chapter 8
and about spot channels in Chapter 6.)
No matter which of the file formats you choose, if you add layers, type, adjust-
ment layers, channels, or paths to your image, keep the original as an unflat-
tened/unmerged (all the layers are preserved) Photoshop (PSD) or layered
TIFF file. In the future, should you ever need to make changes to the image —
or duplicate an effect in the image — you won’t need to start from scratch.
Formats for digital photos
If you print your images yourself at home or office, you can stick with the
original format or use the PSD Photoshop format. If you send the photos to
the local camera shop (or discount store) for printing, stick with JPEG — or,
if they accept it, TIFF. Here are the pros and cons of the major formats that
you should consider for photos:
 PSD: Photoshop’s native file format is great for saving your images with
the most flexibility. Because the PSD format supports all of Photoshop’s
features, you don’t need to flatten your images — and keeping your
layers lets you make changes later. If your file size is very large (4MB or
larger), make a TIFF or JPEG copy before printing, flattening all the
layers. Do not send PSD files to the local shop for prints.
Figure 2-14: Photoshop shows you which
image features are not available in your
selected file format.

 TIFF: Although the TIFF file format (as you
use it in Photoshop) can save your layers
and most other Photoshop features, make
sure to use the Layers➪Flatten Image com-
mand before sending files out for printing.
Layered TIFF files are compatible only with
Photoshop. If you don’t flatten the image
prior to saving as TIFF, or if you elect to
include layers when saving as TIFF,
Photoshop presents you with a gentle
reminder, as show in Figure 2-15.
 JPG: JPEG, as it’s called, is actually a file
compression scheme rather than a file
format, but that’s not important. What is
important is that JPEG throws away some
of your image data when it saves the file.
Save important images in PSD or TIFF and
use JPEG only for copies. When should
you use JPEG? When sending images to a
photo lab that doesn’t accept TIFF files
and when sending images (perhaps by
e-mail or on CD) to people who don’t have
Photoshop. Unlike PSD and TIFF, you can
open JPEG images in a Web browser and
print from there — and so can Granny, and
Cousin Jim, and that overseas soldier you
adopted. When saving JPEGs, the lower
the Quality setting you choose in the JPEG
Options dialog box, the smaller the file but
also the more damage to the image. I dis-
cuss saving as JPEG in more detail in the
sidebar, “Resaving images in the JPEG
format.”
 PDF: It’s easy to overlook Adobe’s PDF
format when talking about photos, but you
should consider using this format.
Although the local photo lab probably
won’t accept it, it’s a great format for shar-
ing your pictures with folks who don’t
have Photoshop. Unlike JPEG, your images
won’t be degraded when saving as PDF;
and like JPEG, just about anyone with a
computer can view the files. (Adobe
Reader, which you can use with PDFs, is
found on just about every computer now,
just like Web browsers for JPEG.) Keep in
mind, however, that PDF files are larger
than JPEGs.

 Large Document Format (PSB):
Really, really, really big pic-
tures — over 30,000 pixels wide
or long or both — need to be
saved in the PSB file format.
Before you can do that, how-
ever, you need to activate the
format in Photoshop’s
Preferences➪File Handling, as
shown in Figure 2-16. Will you
ever need this format? Consider
that 30,000 pixels at a photo-
quality resolution of 300 ppi is
100 inches long. At a resolution
of 85 ppi, more appropriate for 
a long banner to hang in a hall-
way, you’re talking about artwork that stretches almost 30 feet! Can your
printer do that? If not, you probably don’t need the PSB file format.
You could theoretically use a number of other available formats, such as DCS,
PNG, and Photoshop Raw, but there’s no real need with the more common
and more versatile formats about which you just read.
If you’re working with photos from your digital camera and you want to save
them as JPEG but that format isn’t available in the Save As dialog box, con-
vert the image to 8-bit color with Image➪Mode➪8-Bits/Channel. You shot the
image in Raw (or TIFF) and need to convert to 8-bit color if you want to save
as JPEG, because JPEG doesn’t support 16-bit color.
Formats for Web graphics
Generally speaking, you use Photoshop’s Save for Web command (or
ImageReady’s Save Optimize As command) rather than Save As to generate
copies of your images for use on a Web site. Chapter 17 explores Web graph-
ics in detail, but here are the three file formats that you need for the Web:
 JPG: Use JPEG for photos. Remember to resize the photo so that it fits
on a Web page. When selecting a Quality setting, you need to balance
image appearance with file size. A smaller file downloads (and displays
in a Web browser) faster, but a larger file generally looks better. Reduce
the Quality setting until just before the image doesn’t look great and
you’ve hit the sweet spot — the compromise between file size and image
quality.

Format (PSB) for huge projects.

Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
 GIF: GIF is more appropriate for items like
Web buttons and banners (such as those
shown in Figure 2-17) than it is for photos.
If you save a photo that’s more than per-
haps 100 pixels x 100 pixels in size, you
might see some degradation of the image
quality as similar colors become one color.
When you save an image as GIF, it can con-
tain no more than 256 distinct colors. JPEG
and the other common file formats can
have thousands of different colors.
 PNG: PNG comes in two types: PNG-8
(which is a substitute for GIF) and PNG-24
(which is a substitute for JPEG). PNG has a
couple of advantages for Web designers,
such as support for transparency, but not
all Web browsers can display PNG graph-
ics. Generally speaking, it’s safer to use
JPEG and GIF.
Formats for commercial printing
You’re the Photoshop master of your office.
Everyone knows that you understand every-
thing about digital images. So you’re the right
person to create the company’s new brochure.
Except you’re a photographer. Or you’re a Web designer. Or you’re
actually pretty new to Photoshop. And you don’t have a clue about
preparing images for a commercial printing press.
Here’s what you need to know about file formats for those CMYK (cyan,
magenta, yellow, black) color images that you’re sending to the print
shop:
 TIFF: TIFF is generally a solid choice. Use TIFF for photographic
images that don’t contain any type layers.
 EPS: Choose EPS if your image has type. Don’t flatten or merge the
type layers before using Save As to create the EPS. In the EPS
options, make sure to select the Include Vector Data check box to
ensure that your type prints perfectly.
Figure 2-17: Use GIF for Web
interface items.

40
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
If you reopen an EPS file in Photoshop, your type layers get merged.
Don’t! Instead, make sure to save your original file as PSD and, should
you need to make changes, open the PSD and create a new EPS file when
done editing.
 PDF: PDF offers the same disadvantage (don’t reopen in Photoshop) as
the EPS file format. But it also offers support for spot color channels,
alpha channels, and paths — options not supported by EPS. (Spot chan-
nels are used with custom colors, and alpha channels store information
about transparency in the image.) If your file uses any of these features,
choose PDF over EPS (if your print shop accepts PDFs).
Resaving images in the JPEG format
JPEG uses a lossy compression scheme: That
is, as part of the compression process, it actu-
ally permanently throws away some data when
you save your image. The lower the Quality set-
ting, the more image degradation. Take a look
at the figure here. The original image is on the
left. In the middle is the same image saved in
JPEG format with high quality and then on the
right with low quality. See what I mean by
degradation?
If you save by using JPEG a second time, even
more data is thrown away. Every time this hap-
pens, your image quality suffers. Yes, indeed,
there are times when you need to open a JPEG
image, make some changes, and save as JPEG
again (perhaps for the Web, perhaps to share
with non-Photoshop friends and family). To
minimize damage to the image, either use the
highest setting (12) for the Quality setting or (if
you know it) the exact same setting used last
in Photoshop.

When saving as PDF, the PDF Options dialog box offers you Preserve
Photoshop Editing Capabilities. If you select the option, the PDF file will
reopen in Photoshop CS2 with layers and editable type. However, this
option is not compatible with earlier versions of Photoshop and can
cause problems in a page layout program other than InDesign CS2.
 PSD: Use PSD only if you are adding the image file to a project in Adobe
InDesign. Do not send PSD files to a print shop.
 DCS: DCS 2.0 is a variation of the EPS file format that supports spot
color channels and alpha channels. Use it primarily with QuarkXPress.
Formats for PowerPoint and Word
If the final destination of your image is PowerPoint or Microsoft Word, use the
PNG file format. If your image has areas of transparency in it, PNG is definitely
the way to go. (Read about the two types of PNG files in “Formats for Web
graphics,” earlier in this chapter.)
And what about all that neat clip art that you’ve got on your hard drive? How
do you use those images when Photoshop won’t open the vector-based WMF
and EMF clip art files? Here’s how you get clip art into Photoshop, quick and
easy:
1. Open a new document in Microsoft Word (or a comparable word pro-
cessing program).
2. Add the clip art.
In Word, use the command Insert➪Picture➪Clip Art (or your word
processor’s comparable command). Click directly on the artwork and
drag the lower-right corner to resize it to the dimensions that you need
in Photoshop. (The artwork comes into Photoshop at 300 ppi.)
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
This copies the image to the Clipboard (the computer’s memory) in
Word.
4. Switch to your Photoshop document.
5. Paste.
You’ve got your clip art, ready to use in Photoshop! Use the Edit➪
Transform commands to scale, rotate, and otherwise fit the clip art into
your design. (See Figure 2-18.)

Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your
Photoshop Kitchen
In This Chapter
 Understanding the general guidelines for working in Photoshop
 Working more efficiently with customization
 Determining your preferences and color settings
I
know you’re hungry to dive right in and start mixing up some master-
pieces, but before you fire up the stove, look around the kitchen. Get to
know your spoons from your ladles, your pots from your pans, figure out how
to turn on the blender . . . that sort of thing.
In this chapter, rather than going through all the Photoshop CS2
menus, palettes, and tools (which would take several hun-
dred very boring pages), I show you some basic opera-
tional concepts. (But don’t worry — you can read about
how to use specific commands and tools throughout
the book, in the chapters most appropriate for
them.) Here you discover such things as how to spot
which menu commands have dialog boxes, what the
little triangle in the corner of a palette does, and
which tools don’t use the Options bar. You also read
about customizing your Photoshop environment for
faster and more efficient work. Next I show you how
to set up Photoshop’s Preferences and Color Settings.
And to wrap up the chapter — perhaps the most impor-
tant section in this entire book — I explain what to do
when Photoshop doesn’t seem to be working properly.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Food for Thought: How Things Work
A good understanding of certain fundamental operations and features in
Photoshop provides you with the background that you need to follow the
recipes or get creative and whip up some delicious artwork.
And don’t forget about Photoshop’s Tool Tips. If you don’t know what some-
thing or some option does, park your cursor over it for a couple of seconds,
and Photoshop provides its information in a little box.
Ordering from the menus
When you’re working in Photoshop, you see a horizontal list of menus spread
across the very top (Mac) or near the top (Windows) of the screen: File, Edit,
Image, Layer, Select, Filter, View, Window, and Help. (On the Mac, the program
also has a menu named Photoshop, just to the left of the File menu.) As with
most programs you use, you click the name of a menu to reveal its commands.
For both Mac and Windows, you can click and hold the mouse button down
until you’re over the command you want; or, you can click and release, move
the cursor, and then click again. Some commands, such as Crop and Reveal
All, are executed immediately after you choose them. When a command name
in the menu is followed by an ellipsis (...) — the Apply Image command
shown in Figure 3-1, for example — you know that a dialog box will open in
which you input variables and make decisions. A triangle to the right of a
command name, such as what you see next to Rotate Canvas, indicates a sub-
menu. Click the command name, and another menu appears to the right. The
cryptic set of symbols to the right of the Image Size command is the key-
board shortcut for opening the command’s dialog box. (I show you how to
assign keyboard shortcuts later in the section, “Sugar and spice, shortcuts
are nice.”)
As you read in the upcoming section, “Clearing the table: Custom work-
spaces,” Photoshop CS2 menus are customizable — you don’t have to see
commands that you never use. You can also color-code your menu com-
mands, making it easier to spot those that you need regularly.
When a specific command appears grayed out in the menu (in gray type
rather than black), that command isn’t available. Some commands (such as
Reveal All in Figure 3-1) are available only under specific circumstances (like
part of the image being hidden with the Crop tool). When working with
Photoshop’s creative filters, you’ll find that many aren’t available unless
you’re working with an 8-bit RGB (red/green/blue) image. (Color modes and
bit depth are discussed in Chapter 6.)

Figure 3-1: Some commands have submenus, and some have dialog boxes.
Your platter full of palettes
Photoshop (and the other programs of the Adobe Creative Suite) uses float-
ing palettes. The palettes, many of which you see along the right edge of your
screen, always appear on top of (float over) your image window. The image
window will never hide your palettes. (Palettes, however, can hide other
palettes.) The Options bar (across the top of the work area) and the Toolbox
(or toolbar) along the left edge of the
screen are also palettes.
Palettes contain Photoshop features
that you might need to access regu-
larly enough to make it inconvenient
to use a menu command. (I can’t
imagine having to mouse to a menu
command every time I wanted to
change tools or select a specific
layer!) You don’t always need to
have your palettes visible. In
Photoshop, press the Tab key to
hide all the palettes or press
45
Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
Figure 3-2: Nesting palettes and using the
Palette Well prevents crowding the work area.

Shift+Tab to hide all but the Toolbox and the Options bar. With fewer palettes
visible, you provide more room for your image. You can selectively hide and
show palettes via the Window menu.
As you see in Figure 3-2, several palettes can be nested (grouped together). To
bring a palette to the front, click its tab. You can also drag a palette’s tab to
move it out of a group to any location onscreen or into another group. Also,
at the right end of the Options bar is the Palette Well, which contains (by
default) the Brushes, Tool Presets, and Layer Comp palettes. Drag a palette’s
tab into the Palette
Well to get it out of
your way yet leave it
easily accessible.
Many of Photoshop’s
palettes are resizable.
Like an image window,
you drag the lower-
right corner of the
palette to expand or
contract it. You also
have a couple of but-
tons to control the vis-
ibility and size of the
palette or palette
group. Take a look at
Figure 3-3. Macintosh
users have three but-
tons in the upper-left corner of the palette, and Windows users have a pair of
buttons to the upper right.
 Mac
• Click the red button on the right to optimize the palette size,
shrinking or expanding to show only the palette content.
• Click the green button on the left to hide the palette (or palette
group).
• Click the red button a second time to minimize the palette.
Don’t bother clicking the middle button — it’s just for show,
making the palettes match image windows.
 Windows
• Click the right button to hide the palette (or palette group).
• Click the left button to optimize.
46
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Figure 3-3: Mac and Windows have the same functional buttons,
just on opposite sides.

Isn’t the coincidence eerie?
Almost all the Photoshop palettes have a palette menu, in which you select
various options. (The Toolbox and Options bar do not have menus.) You
open the palette menu by clicking the small triangle in the upper-right corner
of the palette. The palette menu contains such options as thumbnail size (for
example, the Layers, Channels, and Paths palettes), how to display items in
the palette (Swatches, Styles, and Brushes among others), or even the size
and content of the palette (Info and Histogram). When the palette is docked in
the Palette Well, the triangle that opens the menu appears in the palette’s tab.
The content of some palettes changes
automatically as you work with your
image. Add a layer, and the Layers
palette shows a new layer. Save a
selection, and the Channels palette
shows a new alpha channel. Drag a
shape tool, and the Layers palette
gets a new layer and the Paths pal-
ette shows the layer’s vector mask.
You control some other palettes by
loading (and deleting) content
through the palette menus or with
the Edit➪Preset Manager command. Use the Preset Manager (as shown in
Figure 3-4) to save sets of your custom bits and pieces as well as to load and
delete items from the palettes.
In addition to the content of the Brushes, Swatches, Styles, and Tool Presets
palettes, you use the Preset Manager with a number of pickers. Pickers are
sort of mini-palettes, available only with certain tools or features. The
Gradient and Custom Shape pickers are accessed through the Options bar
when those tools are in use. The Pattern picker is found in the Fill dialog box,
the Layer Style dialog box, and (with some tools) in the Options bar. The
Contour picker is used with a half-dozen of the effects in the Layer Style
dialog box.
When you create custom layer styles, brushes, gradients, and the like, use
the Preset Manager to protect your work. Create sets of the items and save
those sets with the Preset Manager. Then remember to save copies of the
sets someplace on your hard drive outside the Photoshop folder so that you
don’t accidentally delete them if you ever (oh, no!) have to reinstall
Photoshop. Remember that new content of your palettes is stored only in
Photoshop’s Preferences file (introduced later in this chapter) until you
create and save sets.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Photoshop CS2 introduces some
important changes to the Layers
palette, as shown in Figure 3-5. Layer
sets are no more. The Link column is
gone, too. Instead, Photoshop CS2
gives you the power to select multi-
ple layers by Shift-clicking and 
Ô-clicking/Ctrl-clicking. You can trans-
form multiple layers, but you can’t
add content to multiple layers at the
same time — say, filling a selection on
two or three layers — nor can you
apply a layer style to multiple layers
all at once. You can link and create
layer groups (the functional equiva-
lent of layer sets) from selected layers
through the Layers menu.
The tools of your trade
You control the behavior of Photoshop’s tools through the Options bar. With
the exception of a few path-related tools (Direct Selection, Add Anchor Point,
Delete Anchor Point, and Convert Point), every tool in Photoshop has
options. The Options bar changes as you switch tools. And in some cases,
the Options bar changes while you work with the tool. In the case of the Crop
tool, as shown in Figure 3-6, you have one set of options before you drag the
tool and another set after establishing the bounding box.

Figure 3-6: The Options bar changes when you have any active crop marquee.
The behavior of some tools changes when you add one or more modifier keys
(Ô, Shift, and Option for the Mac; Ctrl, Shift, and Alt for Windows). As an
example of how modifier keys can affect tool behavior, consider the
Rectangular Marquee and Elliptical Marquee tools:
Figure 3-5: There is no longer a link column in
the Layers palette.

 Hold down the Shift key while dragging. Normally the marquee selec-
tion tools are freeform — you drag however you like. When you hold
down the Shift key while dragging, on the other hand, you constrain the
proportions of the selection to a square or circle (rather than a rectan-
gle or ellipse).
 Hold down the Option/Alt key while dragging. When you hold down
the Option/Alt key while dragging a marquee selection tool, the selection
is centered on the point at which you first clicked. Rather than being a
corner of a selection, that starting point is the center of the selection.
 Hold down the Shift and Option/Alt keys while dragging. You can
select from the center while constraining proportions by using the Shift
and Option/Alt keys together.
 Use the Shift key to add to an existing selection. If you already have an
active selection in your image, Shift-dragging a selection tool adds to
that selection. (Press Shift before you click and drag.)
 Use the Option/Alt key to sub-
tract from an existing selection.
When you have an existing
selection and you hold down
the Option/Alt key, you can drag
to subtract from the selection.
Note in Figure 3-7 that the selec-
tion tool’s cursor shows a small
minus sign when subtracting
from a selection.
 “Double-clutch” with the Shift
or Option/Alt key. You can even
constrain proportions or select
from the center and add to or
subtract from a selection. Press
the Shift key (to add to the existing selection) or the Option/Alt key (to
subtract from the existing selection). Click and start dragging the mar-
quee selection tool. While continuing to hold down the mouse button,
release the modifier key and press and hold Shift (to constrain propor-
tions) or Option/Alt (to center the selection) or both; then continue to
drag your selection tool. You might want to use this technique, for exam-
ple, when creating a donut-shaped selection. Drag the initial circular
selection, and then subtract a smaller circular selection from the center
of the initial circle.
Don’t be afraid to experiment with modifier keys while working with tools.
After all, you always have the Undo command (Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z) at hand!

Get Cookin’ with Customization
Customizing Photoshop not only helps you work faster and more efficiently,
but it can also help you work more precisely and prevent tragic errors.
Consider using a Crop tool preset to create a 5 x 7 print at 300 pixels per inch
(ppi). Such a preset will always produce exactly those dimensions, every
single time. Setting up the Crop tool each time you need a 5 x 7 at 300 ppi
doesn’t only waste time, but it also opens the door for time-consuming or
project-wrecking typos. (“Oops! I guess I made a mistake — this image is 5 x 7
at only 30 pixels per inch!”)
Clearing the table: Custom workspaces
One of the easiest ways to work more efficiently is to see your image better.
Generally speaking, bigger is better, so the more room you have on the moni-
tor to display your artwork, the better you can zoom in and do precise work.
The easiest way to gain workspace? Press the Tab key to hide Photoshop’s
palettes. Pressing Shift+Tab hides all the palettes except the Options bar and
the Toolbox.
Keep in mind that you should always use 100% zoom when evaluating your
image for banding or moiré and when applying filters. Any other zoom factor
is a simulation of the image’s appearance.
You can also drag the palettes that you need regularly to the Palette Well and
hide the others. And don’t forget that the major palettes have keyboard
shortcuts assigned to show and hide. Although keyboard shortcuts are cus-
tomizable (as you can read later in this chapter), here are the primary
palettes’ assigned F keys (the function keys that appear at the top of your 
keyboard):
 Actions: Option/Alt+F9
 Brushes: F5
 Color: F6
 Info: F8
 Layers: F7
Any palettes nested with the palette that you show/hide are also shown and
hidden. And don’t forget that you can always restore all palettes to their
default locations with Photoshop’s Window➪Workspace➪Reset Palette
Locations command.

The most efficient way to customize your work area is to create and save spe-
cialized workspaces. Arrange the palettes exactly as you need them for a par-
ticular job you do regularly, choose Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace,
and name the workspace for that type of job. Then you can make a special-
ized workspace for each type of work you do. For example, perhaps when
you do color correction, you need to see the Histogram palette (in the
expanded view), the Info palette, and the Channels palette. Arrange those
palettes how you need them and then hide the rest, saving the workspace
named as Color Correction. Or, perhaps when you create illustrations in
Photoshop, you need to see the Layers and Paths palettes at the same time.
Drag one out of the group to separate it, position them both where conve-
nient, and save the workspace as Illustration.
To access a saved workspace, go to
the Window➪Workspace menu and
select it from the list at the bottom of
the menu, as shown in Figure 3-8.
You’ll see some preset custom work-
spaces in the menu as well.
You can also save the current state of
the customizable keyboard shortcuts
and menus in your workspace.
Although streamlining the menus for
the specific work you’re doing is a
great idea, it’s probably not such a
great idea to have more than one set
of custom keyboard shortcuts. The
time it takes to remember which
shortcuts go with the current work-
space (or to undo a mistake caused
by the wrong shortcut) is time
wasted.
To customize Photoshop’s menus,
choose the Edit➪Menus command.
(Alternatively, open Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts and click the Menus tab.) You’ll
find every menu command listed. You also have the option here of hiding a
command or assigning a custom color to make it easier to identify in the
menu. You might, for example, hide the artistic filters that you never use, and
color-code the others according to how you like or use them (see Figure 3-9).

to instantly rearrange your palettes.

Figure 3-9: You can hide menu commands and color-code the visible commands.
In addition to the application menu commands (from the menus at the top of
the screen), you can switch the Menus For pop-up to Palette menus and cus-
tomize those menus, too. Don’t forget to save your customized menu arrange-
ments with the button directly to the right of the Settings pop-up. Your saved
menu set will appear in that Settings pop-up for easy access.
Sugar and spice, shortcuts are nice
Photoshop’s keyboard shortcuts can save a bunch of time. Rather than mous-
ing to the Toolbox to select the Brush tool, just press B on the keyboard. To
open the Levels dialog box, press Ô+L/Ctrl+L instead of mousing to the Image
menu, down to the Adjustments submenu, and then over and down to Levels.
Photoshop CS2 has customizable keyboard shortcuts. Because the default set
of shortcuts is pretty standard — not only throughout the Adobe Creative
Suite but also with other major programs — you’re probably best served by
making only a couple of changes. Use the Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts com-
mand, as shown in Figure 3-10, to make these shortcut assignments:

Figure 3-10: Assign custom keyboard shortcuts to speed your work.
 Use Ô+P/Ctrl+P to access Print with Preview. As you read in Chapter 4,
you have more control using Print with Preview than you do with the
simple Print command. Therefore it makes more sense to use the sim-
pler and more common shortcut for that command. Locate the Print
with Preview command in the dialog box (under the File menu) and click
the current shortcut. Type the new shortcut. Note that Photoshop warns
you that the shortcut is already in use. Simply change the Print com-
mand to Ô+Option+P/Ctrl+Alt+P to resolve the conflict.
 Change Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z to use Step Backward. In most programs, pressing
Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z keeps undoing — reverting through a series of previous
actions in the program. In Photoshop, however, that shortcut toggles an
Undo/Redo function; that is, press once to undo, and press a second
time to reverse the undo. Bah! Make Photoshop conform to the undo,
undo, undo behavior common to other programs. In Keyboard
Shortcuts, under Edit, change Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z to Step Backward and then
use Ô+Option+Z/Ctrl+Alt+Z to toggle between Undo and Redo.
53
Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen

54
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
 Assign shortcuts to often-used commands. Smart Blur (or Gaussian
Blur) can be assigned Ô+Shift+Option+G/Ctrl+Shift+Alt+G. Smart
Sharpen (or Unsharp Mask) can be assigned Shift+Option+U/
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U. Perhaps use Ô+Shift+R/Ctrl+Shift+R for the Image Size
command. As you work with Photoshop, pay attention to other menu
commands that you access regularly and memorize their keyboard
shortcuts or assign custom shortcuts.
Spoons can’t chop: Creating tool presets
One of the keys to efficient, accurate work in Photoshop is using the right
tool for the job. The Patch tool, for example, copies texture only. If you need
to cover a spot on a client’s face, you need the Clone Stamp tool rather than
the Patch tool. (You can read about how the tools work throughout this
book.)
You can ensure that you’re using not
only the correct tool but also the cor-
rect settings for that tool by creating
tool presets, which store your settings
from the Options bar. You select the
preset tool (and, of course, that’s
where the catchy name comes from)
from the Tool Presets palette or from
the left end of the Options bar, as
shown in Figure 3-11.
Although just about any tool is a good
candidate for tool presets, some are
just plain naturals. Consider, if you
will, the Type tool. When you con-
sider all the options for the Type tool
in not only the Options bar but also in
the Character and Paragraph palettes, there’s quite a bit to select and track.
To ensure consistent text from project to project, consider creating tool pre-
sets for each project, including (as appropriate) headline and body text, spe-
cial effects and accent type, and even your copyright information.
Another logical candidate for tool presets is the Crop tool. As  I explain in
Chapter 4, a photo from a high-end digital camera has an aspect ratio (rela-
tionship between width and height of the image) of 2:3, and common print
and frame aspect ratios include 4:5 (for 8 x 10 prints), 5:7, and 13:19 (for large
prints). (Some lower-cost cameras shoot in different aspect ratios.) You’ll
often find a need to crop an image to a specific size to meet your printing
requirements. And, don’t forget resolution — printing in the correct size at
the wrong resolution is simply a waste of paper and ink! Set up a number of
Crop tool presets for your typical print sizes and relax, knowing that you’ll
always be cropping correctly.
Figure 3-11: Tool presets help you work faster
and more accurately.

Season to Taste: Photoshop’s Settings
The program-level Preferences and the Color Settings flavor all your work in
Photoshop. The options that you choose in Photoshop’s Preferences (or
simply the Prefs) control many facets of the program’s basic behavior.
Choices made in the Color Settings dialog box determine how your work
looks, both onscreen and in print. And when you get down to brass tacks,
that’s what it’s all about — the appearance of your artwork.
Standing orders: Setting the Preferences
Photoshop’s Preferences file stores a whole lot of information about how you
use the program. Whether you prefer to measure in inches or pixels, how you
like the grid and guides displayed, what size thumbnails you prefer in your
palettes, which font you used last —
all sorts of data is maintained in the
Prefs. Much of the info in the
Preferences is picked up automati-
cally as you work (such as the size
and color mode of the last new docu-
ment you created, whether the
Character palette was visible when
you last shut down the program, and
which tool options were selected in
the Options bar), but you actively
select a number of options in
Photoshop’s Preferences dialog box,
as shown in Figure 3-12.
Your custom styles, brushes,
Actions, and the like are recorded only in Photoshop’s Preferences until you
actually save them to your hard drive. That makes them vulnerable to acci-
dental loss. Use the Actions palette menu command Save Action to save sets
of Actions (not individual Actions) and use the Preset Manager (under the
Edit menu) to save sets of your other bits and pieces.
Open the Prefs on a Mac with the keyboard shortcut Ô+K or use the
Photoshop➪Preferences menu to select one of the nine specific subsets of
Preferences to change. The shortcut for Windows users is Ctrl+K, and the
Preferences submenu is under the Edit menu. The default settings are per-
fectly acceptable (after all, they are the defaults for a reason), but here are
some changes to the Prefs to consider, listed by the section of the
Preferences dialog box in which you find them.

If you’ll be doing a lot of resizing and scaling in Photoshop, consider chang-
ing the Image Interpolation method. Use Bicubic Smoother if you’ll be
increasing pixel dimensions regularly; select Bicubic Sharper when downsiz-
ing. If you work on a monitor set to a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels, consider
changing the UI (user interface) Font Size to Small. That shrinks palettes and
gives you a little more room to work.
If you use Adobe Bridge regularly, mark the check box to launch the program
automatically. (I explain how to use Bridge in Chapter 4.) And consider
whether you want to automatically save the history log with each file, in a
text file, or not at all. (The history log tracks all the changes you make to a
file; however, as metadata, it does increase the file size. Read a metadata his-
tory log using the File➪File Info command.)
Preferences➪File Handling
Image previews add a little to the file size, but in most cases, you want to
include the preview. On Macs, you have the option of including a file exten-
sion or not (or having Photoshop ask you each and every time). Even if you
don’t plan on sharing files with a Windows machine, I strongly recommend
that you always include the file extension in the filename by selecting the
Always option. Likewise, I suggest that you always maximize PSD and PSB file
compatibility. This ensures that your Photoshop CS2 files can be opened
(with as many features intact as possible) in earlier versions of the program
and that they’ll function properly with other programs in the Creative Suite. If
you’re in a work group situation (with two or more people working on a
single project), I urge you to use Version Cue (part of the Creative Suite) to
manage work files. It’s a truly great way to avoid singing the Which Version Is
Current Blues.
Preferences➪Display & Cursors
New in Photoshop CS2 are a couple of ways to display cursors for painting
tools. In prior versions, you could show the tool icon (Standard), a small
crosshair (Precise), or a representation of the tool’s brush tip, indicating the
size and shape of the brush (Brush Size). With soft-edged brushes, the brush
size cursor shows where the tool will be applied at 50% strength or higher.
That option is currently called Normal Brush Tip, and you have an alternative
(Full Size Brush Tip) that always shows the full extent of the brush tip,
regardless of the Hardness setting.
Also new is the option of adding a crosshair in the middle of either brush-size
cursor. The crosshair option is great for keeping a brush centered along an
edge or path, and just about eliminates the need for the Precise cursor
option. As you can see in Figure 3-13, when working with a soft brush, 

showing all the pixels that are
changed even a little (to the right)
might not give you an accurate view
of your work. (The Normal Brush Tip
cursor is shown to the left and with
the Show Crosshair in Brush Tip
option to the lower-left.)
When you’re sure that you have a
brush-size cursor selected in the
Preferences but Photoshop shows
you the precise cursor, check the
CapsLock key on your keyboard.
Pressing CapsLock toggles the paint-
ing cursors between precise and brush size.
Preferences➪Transparency & Gamut
If you find the gray-and-white checkerboard pattern distracting in images
with transparency, you can set Grid Size to None, which gives you a plain
white background in transparent areas of your artwork. If you work in
grayscale regularly, you might want to change the color of the transparency
grid to something that contrasts with your image, perhaps pale blue and pale
yellow.
Preferences➪Units & Rulers
If you create Web graphics rather than print images, you probably want to
change Photoshop’s unit of measure from Inches to Pixels. Keep in mind that
you can change the unit of measure on the fly by right-clicking (multibutton
mouse) or Control-clicking (single-button mouse) the rulers in your image. If
you regularly print at a resolution other than 300 ppi, you might also want to
adjust the default resolution for print-size new documents.
Preferences➪Guides, Grid & Slices
Photoshop CS2 introduces Smart
Guides, which appear and disappear
automatically as you drag the con-
tent of one layer into and out of align-
ment with the content of other
layers. Smart Guides (magenta in
color by default), show when the
content of the layer you’re dragging
aligns perfectly with the edges or
center of other layers’ content. See Figure 3-14.

Hardness setting, Normal Brush Tip is usually
best.
Figure 3-14: The magenta guides show how
the layer aligns with other layers.

58
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
The one thing you might want to change in this pane of the Preferences is the
Show Slice Numbers option. The slice numbers appear in the upper-left
corner of each slice when you’re subdividing Web graphics (see Chapter 17).
Unless you intend to edit the images individually later, you probably don’t
need to know which slice is which, so slice numbers are generally not neces-
sary. Clear the check box to remove the distractions.
Preferences➪Plug-Ins & Scratch Disks
If you have third-party plug-ins, filters, and such that you purchased sepa-
rately for use in Photoshop, consider using a second folder for the plug-ins,
outside the Photoshop folder, and designate that folder as the Additional
Plug-Ins Folder in the Preferences. Having your extra plug-ins outside the
Photoshop folder means you won’t have to reinstall them if you have to
replace Photoshop. If any of those plug-ins date to Photoshop 5 — and still
work — you might need to enter Photoshop 5’s serial number as a legacy so
that the plug-ins recognize the new version.
Photoshop’s scratch disks are hard
drive space used to support the
memory. Use only internal hard
drives as scratch disks — never an
external drive, a network drive, or
removable media! If you have multi-
ple internal hard drives, consider a
dedicated partition (perhaps 15GB)
on the second drive — not the drive
on which the operating system is
installed. Name the partition Scratch,
and use it exclusively as a scratch
disk for Photoshop (and perhaps
Adobe Illustrator). If you have a couple of extra internal drives, each can
have a scratch partition, as shown in Figure 3-15. On a Windows computer,
you might see a message warning you that the scratch disk and the Windows
paging file (which serves the same basic purpose at the system level) are on
the same drive. If you have only one internal hard drive, ignore the message.
Preferences➪Memory & Image Cache
The image cache stores low-resolution copies of your image to speed
onscreen display at various zoom levels. Although this process speeds up
screen redraw, the price is accuracy. Unless your video card has trouble dri-
ving your monitor at your selected resolution and color depth, you might be
better served by Cache Levels: 1. That gives the most accurate picture of
your work. (But remember to make critical decisions at 100% zoom, where
one image pixel equals one screen pixel.)
Figure 3-15: Use only internal hard drives for
scratch disks.

Under most circumstances, Photoshop’s memory allocation should remain
set to 70%. If you have 4GB of RAM or more, you can likely increase
Photoshop’s memory usage to 80 or 85%. If you have a very small amount of
installed RAM (say, 512MB) and the operating system is struggling to run,
reduce Photoshop’s maximum memory usage to 50%.
Preferences➪Type
Photoshop CS2 adds a new pane to the Preferences in which you select some
type-related options. Photoshop (finally!) shows the font menu in each font’s
name in the actual typeface, and you can specify the size of that preview
here.
Ensuring consistency: Color Settings
If one term strikes fear deep in the heart of a typical Photoshop user, it’s color
management. Few aspects of the program are so misunderstood. Yet without
wise color management decisions, your images won’t print accurately. For
most Photoshop users, color management can be implemented with a few
key choices in the Edit➪Color Settings dialog box (shown in Figure 3-16):
 Select an RGB working space.
Open the Color Settings dialog
box (under the Edit menu) and
select your RGB working space —
the color space in which you
edit and create. If you primarily
create Web graphics, send your
images to a photo lab for print-
ing, or print with an inkjet
printer that uses only four ink
colors (cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black), choose sRGB as
your color space. If you print to
a mid-level or high-end inkjet
printer or prepare artwork that
will be converted to a CMYK
color space, choose Adobe RGB.
If you have hardware and soft-
ware to create a custom profile for your computer’s monitor, use that
profile.
 Elect to convert images to your working space. In the Color
Management Policies area of the Color Settings dialog box, choose RGB:
Convert to Working RGB. This ensures that the images you see onscreen
actually use your working profile.
59
Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
Figure 3-16: Choose wisely in the Color
Settings dialog box for optimal printing.

60
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
 Turn off the mismatch warnings. Clear the check boxes for those
annoying and time-wasting warnings that pop up onscreen any time you
open an image with a profile other than your working space. You are
intentionally converting to your working space — you don’t need to 
reaffirm the decision every time.
 Output using Print with Preview. When it’s time to print, you’ll get the
most accurate and pleasing prints when you use File➪Print with
Preview. In the dialog box, click the More Options button. In the Color
Management section’s Print area, choose Document to keep the source
space as your working space. In the Options area, choose Color
Handling: Let Photoshop Determine Colors and select the printer’s own
profile for the paper on which you’re printing as the Printer Profile. Use
Relative Colorimetric as the rending intent and leave the Black Point
Compensation check box marked.
The above guidelines are appropriate for most, but not all, Photoshop users.
You might fall into a special category:
 You exclusively create Web graphics. In the Color Settings dialog box,
choose Settings: Color Management Off. In the Save For Web dialog box,
to the upper right of the preview area, choose Uncompensated Color.
When saving images in the JPEG file format, do not embed ICC profiles.
(ICC profiles make specific adjustments to the appearance of your
images to compensate for vagaries of the hardware. I discuss color pro-
files in Chapter 4.) When you eliminate color profiles from the equation,
you’re creating Web graphics that any Web browser can show properly
(or, more accurately, “as properly as the viewer’s uncalibrated monitor
can display”).
 You prepare images for offset or flexographic printing. Your images
end up in a CMYK color space. Communicate with the person preparing
the page layout document in which your images will be placed or
directly with the print shop. Find out what CMYK color profile you
should be using (hopefully a custom profile designed for the specific
press on which the job will be run). And, of course, there’s the possibil-
ity that you will be expected to supply RGB images and let the conver-
sion be handled by folks intimately familiar with the particular workflow
through which your image will pass.
 Your color management requirements are extreme. If color in your
images needs to be absolutely perfect — merely accurate won’t do —
you should consider purchasing hardware and software to calibrate 
and profile all the devices in your workflow. GretagMacBeth (www.
gretagmacbeth.com), ColorVision (www.colorvision.com), and
Monaco (www.xritephoto.com) are three sources to explore.
In order to achieve more consistency between Macs and PCs and among the
programs of the Adobe Creative Suite, the Color Settings command is moved
to the Edit menu for Macs.

When Good Programs Go Bad: Fixing Photoshop
Sometimes things happen. Bad things. Tools don’t work right. Simple com-
mands take ages to execute. Photoshop (gasp!) crashes! Don’t give up, and
please don’t toss the machine through the window. (Hey, I might be walking
past at the time.) Start with the easy fixes and work your way up as necessary.
 Check the palettes and selection. If a tool isn’t working as expected or
is not working at all, check whether you’re inadvertently preventing it
from doing its job. See whether you have an active selection elsewhere
in the image or press Ô+D/Ctrl+D to deselect. Look at the Layers palette:
Are you on the correct layer? Is the layer itself active or a layer mask?
Check the Channels palette: Are the color channels active? At the left
end of the Options bar, right-click (multibutton mouse) or Control-click
(single-button mouse) the tool icon and select Reset Tool. Open another
image — a flattened 8-bit RGB image — and try the tool or technique in
that image. (If it works there, the problem isn’t Photoshop but rather the
specific image. Check the Image➪Mode menu to ensure you’ve got an
appropriate color mode and depth.)
 Reset Photoshop’s Preferences file to the defaults. Before replacing the
Prefs, open Photoshop’s Preset Manager (through the Edit menu) and
save any custom styles, gradients, brushes, and so forth. Save them in a
safe place, outside the Photoshop folder. Open the Actions palette and
save any sets of custom Actions with the palette menu Save Actions
command. (Remember that you must click a set of Actions — not an
individual Action — to use Save Actions.) Open the Preferences and
Color Settings and make notes about any special settings you’re using.
Quit Photoshop and restart the program with the Ô+Option+Shift keys
pressed (Mac); or, immediately after launching the program in Windows,
press and hold the Ctrl+Alt+Shift keys. When asked whether you want to
delete the Settings folder, release the modifier keys and confirm the dele-
tion; then allow Photoshop to finish starting. Reset your Preferences and
Color Settings and reload your custom bits and pieces.
 Reinstall Photoshop. If replacing the Prefs doesn’t solve the problem,
try reinstalling Photoshop. Save all your custom items (as described ear-
lier) and then delete Photoshop and the related files.
• Mac: Drag the Adobe Photoshop folder from the Applications
folder to the Trash. Go to [hard drive]➪Users➪[username]➪
Library➪Preferences and delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings
folder.
• Windows XP: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Add or Remove
Programs to eliminate Photoshop and any third-party plug-ins. (Be
careful about removing shared components if you have other pro-
grams of the Adobe Creative Suite installed — cautious is better.)

After you remove the old copy, reinstall Photoshop from the origi-
nal CD. Make sure to disable all antivirus software and any auto-
backup software before installing, and install into the default
location shown by the installer. Test Photoshop before installing
any third-party plug-ins.
If reinstalling Photoshop won’t solve the problem, the source might be at the
operating system level or perhaps a hardware problem. Call in the big guns

Chapter 4
Getting Images into and out of
Photoshop
In This Chapter
 Mommy, where do pictures come from?
 Keeping track of your images
 Putting pictures on paper
 Using Web sites and e-mail to share your work
Y
ou could, theoretically, open a new empty Photoshop file, paint in it,
save the file, and drive from house to house to show the artwork on     
your computer to friends and family. However, you have lots of ways to
share your images that are much easier. You can print them, post them
on your Web site, or even e-mail them. And e-mailing an image file
across the country is much more convenient (and, of course,
more eco-friendly) than driving hither and yon with your
computer in the trunk.
In this chapter, I show you how to get images into
Photoshop from your digital camera and your scan-
ner, and then how to keep those images organized on
your hard drive and CDs/DVDs. I discuss the basics
of printing your images on inkjet printers (and alter-
natives) and tell you some things you need to know to
make sure you get the prints you expect. I also explain
how to use Photoshop’s automation to create Web sites
of your images as well as how to prepare images for send-
ing by e-mail.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Bringing Images into Photoshop
Artwork in Photoshop originates in one of three ways (as shown in
Figure 4-1):
 You open an image.
 You import an image (typically through a scanning device).
 You create an image from scratch with the File➪New command.
Figure 4- 1: Open an image, scan an image, or create a new image to work in Photoshop.
You can open an image into Photoshop with the File➪Open command,
through Adobe Bridge, or by double-clicking the image file. If you double-
click a file and Photoshop doesn’t launch or the wrong program launches,
you need to associate the file format with Photoshop:
 Mac file association
a. In the Mac Finder, Control-click (one-button mouse) or right-click
(multibutton mouse) a file of the type that you want to open in
Photoshop.

b. From the contextual menu, choose Get Info.
c. In the Get Info dialog box, expand the Opens With area, choose
Photoshop cs2 from the pop-up menu, and click Change All.
d. (Optional) Repeat for any additional file formats.
If you double-click a file and Photoshop launches but the image
doesn’t open, you’ve likely made a change to the Mac OS and need
to reinstall Photoshop.
 Windows file association
a. In Windows Explorer/My Computer, right-click a file of the type that
you want to change.
b. From the contextual menu, choose Properties.
c. To the right of Open With, click the Change button, choose Photoshop
cs2, and click OK.
d. Click OK again to close the Properties dialog box.
e. (Optional) Repeat for any additional file formats.
Downloading from your digital camera
You can use the software that comes with your digital camera to transfer
photographs from it to your computer’s hard drive. Or, if you have the hard-
ware, you can remove your camera’s memory card, memory stick, or other
media from the camera and use a card reader, which is a small device
designed to read camera storage media. Transferring via the Mac Finder or
Windows Explorer is generally much faster and usually just as reliable as
transferring using the camera manufacturer’s software.
Never open an image into Photoshop directly from a camera, Flash card, or
CD/DVD. Doing so can slow down your work, and you also risk losing your
work if Photoshop isn’t able to immediately and efficiently read the original
file while you work. And, of course, you can’t save from Photoshop back to
most removable media, so you need to create a new file (on a writable drive),
anyway. Open images from a network drive only when working with Adobe’s
Version Cue, the Adobe Creative Suite’s project management software.
After the images are safely stored on your local hard drive (or a high-speed
external hard drive), you open them in Photoshop using one of the three
methods that I describe earlier in the chapter. Depending on your color set-
tings, you might see a warning that the image’s color profile and the profile
that you selected as your RGB working space don’t match. Photoshop asks
you what you want to do (see Figure 4-2). Generally speaking, you want to
convert to your working space so that you see the most accurate color on

your monitor. You might want to pre-
serve the embedded profile if you’ll
be returning the image to the origi-
nating computer after looking at or
working on it. The third option disre-
gards all color profiles and works
with uncorrected color. This is a
good choice when working with
images that you will later use with a
noncolor-managed program, such as
a Web browser or presentation pro-
gram. (Without color management,
you see the image as it will appear in
the other program.) You can disable the color mismatch warnings in
Photoshop’s Color Settings dialog box.
When opening an image that includes text, you might also get a message warn-
ing you that the type layers need to be updated. Generally speaking, you do
want to update unless the image contains fonts not available on your computer.
Figure 4-2: When color profiles don’t match,
you have to make a choice.
Purchasing commercial images
Some projects require images that you can’t
run out and shoot yourself. Say, for example,
that you’re preparing a poster or brochure
about a ski trip to Japan. In your office or
studio. In the United States. In July. Pretty
tough to shoot what you need, eh? Turn to
stock photography. You can purchase or
license stock images (photos, illustrations,
video, even audio) from a wide variety of
sources, including Internet-based services and
collections on CD/DVD. In fact, you’ll see
images from PhotoSpin.com in a variety of
places in this book. Through Adobe Bridge (you
can read about this elsewhere in this chapter),
you can access over 300,000 stock images from
a number of major suppliers.
When you consider using stock images, keep
in mind the difference between royalty-free
and rights-managed. Royalty-free images are
yours to use as you see fit (within the terms of
your agreement — no resale as stock photos,
no defamatory or pornographic use, and so on).
You can use the images when you need them,
as often as you need them. Rights-managed
photos, on the other hand, are licensed for a
specific use, in specific media, for a specified
time. Rights-managed artwork does have one
advantage over royalty free. Because usage is
controlled, you can license exclusive rights to
the image for that period of time — the image
you use won’t appear in some competitor’s
advertising at the same time. Royalty-free
photos, on the other hand, are available to
anyone who pays for them, and usage is not
controlled.

Scanning prints
You place a photo (face down) on the glass of your scanner. You push a
button. It automatically appears on your computer screen. That’s scanning at
its most basic. If your scanner’s software installed a Photoshop-compatible
plug-in into the Import/Export folder inside Photoshop’s Plug-Ins folder, you
can scan from within Photoshop. (The File➪Import menu will show your
scanner by name.)
Determining scan resolution
Before scanning an image, you need to make some decisions:
 How you want to use the image
 What its final size will be
 What resolution you need
By determining how many pixels you need beforehand, you eliminate the
need to resize the image in Photoshop (and the resulting image degradation).
Many scanner interface windows let you input the final size and resolution
you need right in the scan window. If you find the need to calculate scan reso-
lution manually, here’s how:
1. Determine the required pixel dimensions.
• For print: If you’ll be printing the image, determine the size at
which you want to print (in inches) and the resolution at which
you want to print (typically 300 ppi [pixels per inch] is a good
choice). Multiply the print width and height by the resolution to
determine pixel dimensions.
• For the Web: If the image is destined for your Web site, determine
how much of your page the image will occupy (in pixels).
2. Measure the original.
Before placing it on the scanner’s glass, measure the original image. If
you’re using only part of the image, measure that part. (Be careful not to
scratch the original with your ruler!)
3. Do the math.
Divide your required pixel dimensions (Step 1) by the physical dimen-
sions of the original (Step 2). The result is your scan resolution. (If you
get different numbers for the width and height, use the larger and expect
to do some cropping in Photoshop.)
67
Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop

68
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Many flatbed scanners (scanners designed for use with documents and
photos) have transparency adapters that let you scan film and slides.
However, if you have a lot of negatives or slides to scan or if the best possible
quality is required, consider a dedicated film scanner from Nikon, Minolta, or
Kodak.
Preventing moiré patterns
Unless you spent thousands of dollars on your scanner, you probably want to
forget about the scanner software’s color and tonal correction capabilities —
Photoshop gives you more control. However, here is one thing that scanner
software does much better than Photoshop, and it’s a capability that you
should use when appropriate: moiré (pronounced, roughly, mwah-RAY)
reduction. A moiré pattern is a visible rosette pattern created by the pattern
of dots placed by the printing press to reproduce color.
When you need to scan a color image
or artwork that comes from a book,
magazine, or newspaper (or other
material printed on an offset printing
press, such as product packaging or
signs), you want to use the scanner’s
software to reduce moiré. The scan-
ner’s software compensates for the
pattern (when you let the scanner
know the pattern is there) and
smoothes the scanned image (as you
can see in Figure 4-3).
The moiré reduction feature in your scanner’s software might not be immedi-
ately recognizable. It might be labeled Descreening, or it could be a choice
between Color (Photo) and Color (Document). As always, refer to your hard-
ware’s User Guide for specific guidance.
If rescanning is out of the question and you have a moiré pattern to reduce in
Photoshop, blur the image enough to disguise the problem, and then paint
with the History Brush to restore areas of critical detail in the image.
Here’s an important announcement from The Department of An Ounce of
Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure: Before doing any scanning, make sure
that the scanner’s glass is clean and free of dust. Likewise, check the inside of
the scanner’s lid. (What good is it to clean the glass if dust from the lid is
going to contaminate it again as soon as you close it?) Remember that a
minute or two spent cleaning the scanner could save hours of touch-up in
Photoshop. Use a can of compressed air to dust the surface. If necessary,
eliminate fingerprints or smears with appropriate glass cleaner. (Check the
scanner’s User Guide for cleaning instructions — and be careful when 
using liquid glass cleaner with an electrical device! I like to use the same 
Figure 4-3: Scanning without (left) and with the
scanner’s moiré reduction option.

premoistened wipes I use for my eyeglasses.) And use a burst of compressed
air on the original, too, before placing it on the glass. Just be careful — hold
the can of air some distance away from the photo and spray at an angle so
that you don’t damage the original.
Keeping Your Images Organized
Because digital photography doesn’t have a per-shot cost (as does shooting
film), there is certainly a tendency to shoot more. And more. And more.
Experimental shots, this-might-be-interesting shots, special effects shots, and
(at least in my case) the same shot over and over and over again. They build
up on your hard drive. (Who would have thought, even a few years ago, that
a hard drive with a capacity of over 100 gigabytes could ever be filled up?
Now, I’m not the youngest bull in the herd, but I remember backing up my
hard drive to 3.5-inch floppy disks — and not that many of them either!)
It’s pretty easy to stay organized after you choose a system. The hard part is
actually deleting those digital photos that you really don’t need to keep —
you know, out-of-focus, shot at a bad angle, Aunt Betsy’s eyes were closed
and mouth was open, the 400th shot of the dogs sleeping all curled up, the
401st shot of the dogs sleeping all curled up, and the like. It takes discipline!
(Or an optical drive that can burn CDs and/or DVDs.)
Creating a folder structure
I generally recommend using a subject-based organization scheme, such as
that shown in Figure 4-4. For example, inside the main folder named
DigitalPhotos, you might have subfolders named Vacations, Work-Related,
Holidays_2004, and FamilyPortraits. (Notice that none of the folder names
use empty spaces or characters other than letters, numbers, a dash, and an
underscore — that minimizes the possibility that Photoshop or another pro-
gram won’t be able to find a file.) Within the Vacations subfolder, you might
have more subfolders with names such as Tahiti_2004, Snowmass_2005,
Paris-Spring_2005, and Paris-Autumn_2004. Or you might have subfolders
with names like Mom-and-Dad_2004, Akron_2004, Toledo_2005, and
Cleveland_2004. Or, if you’ve got a work schedule like mine, the Vacations
folder might be completely empty.

Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop

70
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Figure 4-4: Organize with subfolders.
Don’t overload your folders! If you find that your computer is slowing down
when it tries to display the content of a folder, you’ve got too many files in
the folder. Create a second folder of the same name and add -01 and -02 to the
folder names. Generally speaking, 100MB is probably as large as you want in
a single folder.
You can use your computer’s CD/DVD drive (if it has the capability) to burn
folders of images to disk. This not only provides you with a reliable backup
(assuming you store the disks correctly and handle them carefully), but it can
free up space on your hard drive. Your folder/subfolder structure can also be
used when creating your disks.
Using Adobe Bridge
New in Photoshop CS2 — oops, make that “new out of Photoshop CS2” — is
Adobe Bridge, the standalone replacement for the File Browser to organize, pre-
view, and open your images. The File Browser, introduced with Photoshop 7,
was such a great hit that Adobe decided to expand the concept to the entire
Adobe Creative Suite. Rather than adding a browser to each program in the
Creative Suite, a single additional program was developed — one that would
work with all the individual components. The result is Adobe Bridge.
Bridge is installed at the same time you install Photoshop CS2 or the Creative
Suite. Unlike ImageReady (the standalone Web graphics program you

installed with Photoshop), Bridge has its own folder on your hard drive.
(You’ll find the Adobe Bridge folder inside the Applications folder on the
Mac/in Program Files for Windows.) You can open Bridge independently, or
you can use Photoshop’s File➪Browse command to launch Bridge, which you
see in Figure 4-5. You’ll find one major change from the File Browser to
Bridge: Bridge (because it’s a separate program) has its menus across the top
of your screen.
Figure 4-5: Adobe Bridge replaces the File Browser but serves the same function.
Here are a few tips for working with Adobe
Bridge:
 Use keywords and categories. Using the
Keywords tab in the lower-left of the
Bridge window (as shown in Figure 4-6),
you can assign keywords and categories to
images. Keywords and categories are
descriptive terms that you assign to indi-
vidual images. Down the road, you can use
Bridge’s Search feature to find all images
with a specific assigned keyword.

You can select multiple images in Bridge by clicking and Shift-clicking
(or Ô-clicking/Ctrl-clicking) and then assign keywords to all the selected
images at once.
 Use labels and ratings. Under the Label menu (which you see in Figure
4-7), you can assign a star rating to each
image and assign colors to organize by
subject or project. Use the View➪Sort
menu to arrange images in the thumbnails
area of Bridge according to either the label
or the rating.
 Add folders to the Favorites. You invari-
ably will visit some folders on a regular
basis. Use the File➪Add to Favorites com-
mand to get back to that folder faster and
more easily. In the upper-left corner of the
Bridge window, click the Favorites tab for
one-click access. Keep in mind, too, that
you can add a folder to the Favorites while
working on a specific project, and then use
the File➪Remove from Favorites command
when the project is finished.
 Change your view and workspace. Use the
View menu to customize what the Bridge
window shows, and use the Window➪
Workspace menu to determine how it is dis-
played. In Figure 4-8, you see the default workspace as well as the
Lightbox workspace (which shows a number of fairly large images) and
the Filmstrip Focus view (for seeing a number of thumbnails and a large
preview).
 Export the cache. When the content of a folder is finalized — when the
images in the folder won’t change — use the Tools➪Cache➪Export
Cache command. Exporting the cache drastically reduces the amount of
time it takes to display thumbnails and metadata. If the content of the
folder does change, purge the folder’s cache and export again (both by
using the Tools➪Cache menu). Remember to export the cache just
before burning a folder of images to CD or DVD.
Figure 4-7: Use star ratings and
labels as reminders and to sort
your images.

Figure 4-8: Use a workspace that fits your needs.
Renaming image files easily
All right, then, you’ve arranged a
hierarchy of folders and subfolders.
You’ve sorted your images into those
folders. You’ve assigned rank and
label to the images. However, you still
have no idea which is which in the
File➪Open Recent menu. Filenames
such as CRW_1907.crw and
PB270091.jpg don’t tell you much
about the image content, do they?
Use Bridge’s Tools➪Batch Rename
command (as shown in Figure 4-9)
to assign more meaningful (and
informative) names to your files.
Select content from each field from
the pop-up menu or type in a field.

Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
Figure 4-9: Use Batch Rename to assign
informative names to files.

74
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
So that each of your original images gets a unique one-of-a-kind name, you
must include a variable when using Batch Rename. (If you did try to rename
all the images in a folder to say, picture.jpg, you would end up with only
one image file in the destination folder — each would overwrite the previ-
ous.) Therefore, when using Batch Rename, you must choose one of the vari-
ables for one of the fields via the pop-up menu, be it the original document
name or a sequence number/letter. Also keep in mind that you should not
type a period (.) into any field. That character should be used only before
the file extension. And, as a wonderful keep-us-from-creating-problems-for-
ourselves improvement, Batch Rename now automatically adds the file exten-
sion for you.
Printing Your Images
In the very recent past, the subject of printing images from Photoshop
required a huge number of pages. Thankfully, improvements in hardware and
software make printing much easier. Monitors are well calibrated out of the
box, printers reproduce color more accurately, and inks and papers last for
decades. Yes, things have come a long way in a short time. But before you
click the Print button, you should make sure that your image is ready to
print. Will it fit properly on the page and in the frame? Are the pixels small
enough that they blend evenly into the overall picture? Will the colors you
envision be the colors that appear on paper?
Cropping to a specific aspect ratio
Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of your image.
An image in landscape aspect ratio is wider than it is tall, and an image in por-
trait aspect ratio is taller than wide. Although digital cameras capture in a
variety of aspect ratios, including 3:4 and 4:5, SLR (single lens reflex) cameras
typically use a 2:3 aspect ratio: One side is one-and-one-half times the size of
the adjoining sides. Typical print (and picture frame) sizes are 8 x 10 inches
(a 4:5 aspect ratio), 5 x 7 inches (5:7), 4 x 6 inches (2:3), and 3 x 5 inches (3:5).
In Figure 4-10, the 2:3 aspect ratio is outlined in green, 5:7 is shown in yellow,
and 4:5 is red.
Although an 8 x 10 print is physically larger than a 4 x 6 print, it actually
prints less of your original image because it must be cropped. The 4 x 6 print,
with a 2:3 aspect ratio, includes all the original image; the 8 x 10 print (with
its 4:5 aspect ration) is missing two full inches of the image’s longer dimen-
sion. To print 8 inches wide and retain the entire image, you’d be printing
at 8 x 12.

Figure 4-10: Different print sizes encompass different amounts of your image.
In Photoshop, you can change the aspect ratio of your image with the Canvas
Size command (if one dimension is already correctly sized), the Crop tool, or
the Rectangular Marquee tool with the Image➪Crop command. The Crop tool
can resample your image to the exact print dimensions and resolution in one
step, but you generally need to use the Image Size command when changing
aspect ratio with Canvas Size or the Rectangular Marquee.
With the Crop tool selected, you can enter specific dimensions and a target
resolution on the Options bar. Drag the tool, position and adjust the bound-
ing box, and then press Return/Enter on your keyboard to execute the crop.
Whatever is within the bounding box is resampled to the exact size that you
specify on the Options bar. (Remember to click the Clear button on the
Options bar afterward to restore the Crop tool to its normal behavior.)
When cropping, Photoshop uses the resampling algorithm that you specify in
Preferences➪General as the Image Interpolation method. For best results,
choose Bicubic Smoother when increasing an image’s size and Bicubic
Sharper when decreasing the size.
75
Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop

76
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
When creating a cropping selection with
the Rectangular Marquee tool, you can
change the tool’s Style pop-up menu (on
the Options bar) from Normal to Fixed
Aspect Ratio or Fixed Size. Generally
speaking, use Fixed Aspect Ratio (as
shown in Figure 4-11) and drag the mar-
quee to encompass that part of the
image you want to retain. After the
selection marquee is how and where
you want it, use the Image➪Crop 
command.
Keep in mind that the Crop command
doesn’t resample the image — you’ve
just changed the aspect ratio so far —
so you need to also use the Image➪Image Size command (which is discussed
in Chapter 2).
Remembering resolution
Chapter 2 presents you with an in-depth look at resolution as it pertains to
digital imaging. As a quick refresher, keep these points in mind when thinking
about printing your images:
 Images themselves have no resolution. Whether in your camera, on
your hard drive, or open in Photoshop, your images consist only of tiny
colored squares called pixels. The image looks and acts the same within
Photoshop, regardless of resolution. An image 3000 x 2000 pixels at 300
ppi is handled in Photoshop exactly as an image 3000 x 2000 pixels at 
72 ppi.
 Resolution is an instruction to a printing device. The resolution value
that you assign to an image in your digital camera or in Photoshop’s
Image Size dialog box is recorded with the image strictly as an instruc-
tion to the output device.
 Resolution measures the size of individual pixels. 300 ppi really means
that each pixel will print at a size exactly 1⁄300 of an inch square. Likewise,
72 ppi equates to each pixel printing at 1⁄72 of an inch square. Some folks
might find this reasoning uncomfortable (although they can deny nei-
ther the mathematics nor the logic). Should you run across such an indi-
vidual, feel free to ask this question: “What if an image’s resolution is 300
pixels per inch, but the image is only 299 pixels wide?” (Then smile and
buy the next beverage.)
 Web images use only pixel dimensions. Web browsers aren’t capable of
reading the resolution information embedded in your simple graphics by
Photoshop. Each image is displayed in the Web browser strictly accord-
ing to the number of pixels in the image.

Controlling color using Print with Preview
In the past few years, reproducing accurate color from monitor to printer has
become much easier. Although the process of color management still strikes
fear into the hearts of many, the actual need for complex hardware and soft-
ware to control color is greatly reduced. Why? Simply because computer
manufacturers recognized that we, the consumers, wanted better color.
(Okay, maybe it was all the video gamers that got the attention.) Monitors
ship from the factory calibrated and accurate. Printers use smaller droplets
and better inks. Software does a better job of communicating color.
For most Photoshop users, accurate color is important. After spending hours
tweaking an image’s appearance onscreen, surely you want the print to look
exactly like the monitor. Here’s how to get that great color:
1. When you’re ready to output your image, use Photoshop’s File➪Print
with Preview command rather than the simple Print command.
Print with Preview gives you quite a few more options than you have in
the regular Print dialog box, including the color management options
used here. Compare the two dialog boxes in Figure 4-12.
©2004 PhotoSpin, PhotoSpin image #1440009
Figure 4-12: Use the larger Print with Preview dialog box for more control over color.
2. In the Print with Preview dialog box, click the More Options button to
expand the dialog box.

3. Choose Print: Document.
In the Color Management section of the dialog box, make sure that the
Print option is set to Document rather than Proof. The document’s color
profile should show in parentheses, and that profile should be your
working RGB from Photoshop’s Color Settings dialog box. Unless you
have a custom monitor profile, use Adobe RGB (for mid- to high-end
inkjet printers) or sRGB (for entry-level four-ink printers).
4. Choose your options.
• In the Options section of the dialog box, select Color Handling: Let
Photoshop Determine Colors.
• From the Printer Profile pop-up menu, choose the printer’s own pro-
file for the paper on which you’re printing.
• For Rendering Intent, choose Relative Colorimetric and select the
Black Point Compensation check box.
5. When ready, click the Print button.
Clicking the Print with Preview Print button closes the dialog box and
moves you to the printer’s own Print dialog box.
6. Disable the printer’s color management.
Because you’re doing all your color management in Photoshop, you want
to disable all printer-level color management in the printer’s own Print
dialog box. (Check your printer’s User Guide for specific instructions.)
7. Print.
Clicking the Print button in the printer’s dialog box sends the image to
the printer and starts the actual process of putting ink on paper.
Don’t forget that Photoshop CS2 offers you a couple of different ways to save
paper (and time and money) by printing multiple images on a single sheet of
paper. See Chapter 16 for information on Picture Package and Contact Sheet.
Considering color management solutions
If your prints don’t match your monitor, first evaluate your monitor’s set-
tings. Open an image with known color values (you know what the image
should look like) in a noncolor-managed program. You might, for example,
use Microsoft Word’s Insert➪Picture➪From File command to add the image
Ducky.tif from the Samples folder (inside the Photoshop folder) to a blank
Word document. Use the monitor’s own controls to make that image look the
best possible, and then print. If the image prints accurately, great — you’re
all set.

Check your color (Mac only)
The Mac OS includes a great little program
called DigitalColor Meter. You’ll find it in the
Applications➪Utilities folder. Open DigitalColor
Meter and position the window in the lower
center of your screen. Open Photoshop. Drag
the Swatches palette to the center of the
screen, above DigitalColor Meter. (If necessary,
use the Swatches palette menu command
Reset Swatches to make the default swatches
visible in the palette.) Move the cursor onto the
first swatch. If your selected monitor profile is
accurate and your monitor is working properly,
DigitalColor Meter will show RGB values of
255/0/0 (see the figure here). Try the next five
swatches. You should see Yellow: 255/255/0;
Green: 0/255/0; Cyan: 0/255/255; Blue: 0/0/255;
and Magenta: 255/0/255.
If you have an Apple Cinema Display or an Apple
Studio Display and DigitalColor Meter tells you
something’s not quite right, try the simple
solution. Open Apple’s System Preferences and
click Displays. On the Color tab, select Adobe
If the monitor looks great but the print is strange, first try cleaning and cali-
brating the print head. And take another look at the Print dialog box to make
sure that you’re selecting the proper paper and color settings. (Again, refer to
the User Guide for your printer for specific instructions.)
For those among us whose work (or play) requires extreme color fidelity, a
number of companies offer hardware and software that regulate color. You
can create custom profiles for monitors, printers, and even scanners and 
digital cameras. Although not inexpensive, skillful handling (in accordance
with the User Guides!) not only results in better prints, but also reduces the
amount of aw-shucks wasted paper and ink from bad output. If you fall into
this category, explore the current offerings from GretagMacBeth (www.
gretagmacbeth.com) and ColorVision (www.colorvision.com).

RGB as the system-level color profile and then
close System Preferences. In Photoshop’s
Color Settings dialog box, select Adobe RGB as
the RGB Working Space. Open DigitalColor
Meter again and test that Swatches palette
once more.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Keep in mind that all the color management hardware and software in the
world doesn’t do you a bit of good if you’re not controlling your environment.
If your work requires perfect color — not good, but perfect — you need to
take some additional steps. In the office or studio, you need to regulate ambi-
ent light so that you have a consistent color-viewing situation, day in and day
out, rain or shine, summer and winter. If you have windows, you need shades
or drapes that you can close before doing color-critical work. The walls visi-
ble behind the monitor and the immediate work area should be neutral in
color. (And that means no brightly colored sticky notes on the bezel of your
monitor!) You probably need a hood for your monitor and perhaps a D50 (or
D65) viewing station in which to evaluate your prints under optimal lighting
conditions.
Printing alternatives
Odds are that you use an inkjet
printer to put your photos on paper.
Although inkjet printers are the most
popular and perhaps the most practi-
cal, you do have alternatives. If, for
example, your work consists of
brochures and flyers rather than
photos, a color laser printer might
better fit your needs. The initial cost
is generally higher than all except
wide-format inkjets, but the cost per
page is much lower. Color laser print-
ers generally don’t print pho-
tographs as well as a mid- to
high-end inkjet, and the prints are
not archival (they won’t last for a
whole lot of years without fading), but such prints might be just fine for shar-
ing snapshots among friends and family. The print options for a color laser
printer (such as the Print dialog box you see in Figure 4-13) differ from an
inkjet’s options. Check the User Guide for the specific printer to set up your
job correctly.
Dye sublimation printers use rolls of film impregnated with dyes to repro-
duce prints. Prices range from under $200 to several thousand dollars. The
quality and longevity of the prints is generally tied to the price.
Here’s another output alternative available to virtually all Photoshop users.
Burn your images in JPEG format (highest quality, 300 ppi) onto a CD and
take the CD to the local photo lab. Alternatively, use an online service with
which you upload your JPEGs to the service’s Web service to order prints.
You’ll get back glossy or matte prints at the size(s) requested. And the cost
per print can be substantially less than using your inkjet printer. The local
Figure 4-13: Color laser printer options differ
from those for inkjet printers.

photo lab is often a great alternative for stacks of vacation photos and family
reunion shots that need to be sent to a whole passel of kin.
Unless your inkjet printer is specifically designed to generate grayscale
images, you might want to use the photo lab for such prints. Inkjet printers
designed with grayscale in mind output using black ink plus a supplemental
light-black or gray ink to increase the tonal range and ensure adequate detail
in your shadows. Inkjets that aren’t designed to print grayscale can either
print using only black ink (which severely limits the detail and tonal range),
or they use rich black (black ink supplemented with the additional color
inks), which invariably leads to some color tint or color cast in the suppos-
edly neutral grayscale images. It’s the nature of the beast — ink droplets are
placed near each other, not on top of each other, which leads to the visible
tinting of a grayscale image when printed on an inkjet using colored inks.
Check the User Guide for your printer: If it doesn’t provide specific guidance
for printing grayscale, send your black-and-white images to the local photo
lab for output.
Sharing Your Images on the Internet
To post your images on a Web site, you need a couple of things: a Web site
and a Web server on which to post. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) —
the folks you pay to let you surf the Net and get e-mail — might have space
reserved for you as part of your contract, or you might need to pay extra.
Check your contract or call the ISP. (When it comes time to actually put your
site on the Web, called posting the site, you need to check the ISP’s Web site
for specific instructions.)
Using Web Photo Gallery
To get your site ready to post, you can use Photoshop’s Web Photo Gallery
feature. (If you have GoLive, you might want to use that program or perhaps
generate a Web Photo Gallery and customize it in GoLive.) Web Photo Gallery
creates the entire Web site from your folder of images and the guidance that
you provide for customization of the site. You end up with a home page
(named index.htm — the page you open in your Web browser) as well as
folders named Pages, Thumbnails, and Images. Depending on the layout you
select, you might also generate a few additional files. Remember that you
must keep all these elements together for the Web site to function properly.
As you see in Figure 4-14, you have a rather long list of site layouts from
which to choose. (Your list might vary.) Thankfully, the preview below the
Cancel button gives you some idea of the layout, so you don’t have to gener-
ate a full Web Photo Gallery only to change your mind.
81
Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop

82
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
Figure 4-14: To the right, you see the substantial list of Web Photo Gallery templates.
In the top sections of the Web Photo Gallery dialog box, you choose the
layout from the Style menu, enter your e-mail address so visitors to the site
can tell you how wonderful it is, and select both a source folder (the images
to post on the site) and the destination (a folder where the various parts of
your new Web site can be saved — any place except the source folder).
In the Options area of the Web Photo Gallery dialog box, you make decisions
about how you want to customize the template. In additional to the General
options shown in Figure 4-14, you have five additional panels of options in
which to work: Banner, Large Images, Thumbnails, Custom Color, and
Security (shown in Figure 4-15). Note that not all options are available for all
templates. If having the filename as a caption is critical to your concept,
make sure you’re using a template that includes that option.

Figure 4-15: Not all options are available for every Web Photo Gallery template.
Prepare a folder of perhaps four or five images and create galleries from the
layouts that look most interesting. By using only a few images, you save a
bunch of time while experimenting. This also gives you a chance to preview
the options you’ve selected, including the font size for Security. (It would be a
shame to generate a gallery of hundreds of images only to find out that your
copyright notice is wider than the images.) Remember, too, that you can man-
ually create a replacement image (see Chapter 17) and substitute it in the
Images folder (using exactly the same name). And as a great shortcut to gen-
erate small images for another program or a PDF Presentation, you can run
Web Photo Gallery and then delete everything except the Images folder.
E-mailing your images
In addition to posting your images on the Web as a Web Photo Gallery, you
can use your e-mail program to share your images. However, if you like these
folks enough to send them your images, you probably want to keep their
83

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
friendship. And to that end, you want to be a responsible e-mailer — you
don’t want to send out an e-mail attachment so large that it disrupts service
for the recipient. (“Hi Marge. You know those images from your vacation that
you e-mailed me on Tuesday? They’re still trying to download. Yeah, today is
Saturday. Anyway, why don’t I drive up to Maine and look at the snapshots —
it’s probably faster than waiting for the e-mail.”)
As a general rule, your attached images should rarely (if ever) total more
than 1MB in size (unless you verify through direct communication that every-
one on your To: list can handle large attachments). Each individual image
should be no more than 550 pixels tall (so that it can be viewed in a Web
browser on any screen). You can certainly use your computer’s compression
utility — StuffIt (Mac) or WinZip (Windows) — to compress one or more
images before sending. But if you do compress your attached images, make
sure to include instructions to save the compressed file to the hard drive and
double-click to expand.

Part II
Easy Enhancements
for Digital Images

In this part . . .
S
ome photos can be printed straight from the
camera without ever seeing the light of
Photoshop. However, most images need at least
some adjustment, and many need a lot of adjust-
ment. Here’s where you discover how to work
magic on your images.
The range of brightness from black to white is crit-
ical for most images. In Chapter 5, you read how
to maximize and adjust that tonal range in your
photos, and how to use the new Photoshop CS2
Histogram palette. And there’s more to a great
photo than shadows and highlights. Chapter 6
looks at adjusting the color in your images,
making them look as natural as possible. More and
more digital photographers are switching to the
Raw ﬁle format because of the control it provides
over the ﬁnal image. Read Chapter 7 for the Raw
lowdown.
Sometimes only part of an image needs to be
adjusted. The key to making precise adjustments,
as you can read in Chapter 8, is to tell Photoshop
where to work with selections and masks. Chapter
9 examines many of the most common problems
in Photoshop (and what to do about them). You
can read about eliminating red-eye, reducing wrin-
kles, whitening teeth, and minimizing digital noise.

t’s the difference between an Ansel Adams print and the snapshot of your
grandfather as a boy. It’s the difference between high-definition TV and the
local public access channel’s broadcast. It’s the difference between a Ferrari
and a minivan. It’s that thing — that special something — that tells
you that you’re seeing the real deal, the genuine article, all that
it can be. And it’s something that you can do for your
images.
When an image really pops — when it jumps off the
page at you — it’s generally because the shadows
are dark, the highlights are light, and the colors are
rich. I’m sure it’s no surprise to you that Photoshop
can handle the job. (That’s one of the reasons why
you bought the program, right?)
In this chapter, I introduce you to the concept of 
tonality, which is the range of brightness in your 
image. I also introduce to you the various commands
that Photoshop offers for you to adjust your image’s tonal-
ity. There are even a couple of tools for pin-point control of
shadows and highlights. And along the way, I offer you a look at the
Histogram palette — what it tells you, what it doesn’t tell you, and how 
to use it best.

88
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Adjusting Tonality to Make Your Images Pop
Most photos look better with a little
tweaking. For pictures that look good
to begin with, you might still want to
perk them up a little with a tonal
adjustment. Making the shadows a
little darker and the highlights a bit
lighter increases your image’s per-
ceived tonal range, which is sort of
the distance between black and
white. Take a look at Figure 5-1. It’s 
a pleasant enough snapshot, with
decent composition and an interest-
ing subject (very interesting when
you get to know her!). But it lacks 
pizzazz.
With Photoshop, you can darken 
the shadows and lighten the rest of
the image to make it more interest-
ing. By intensifying the difference
between what the eye sees as dark
and what the eye sees as light in the
image, you add some semblance of
depth to this simple picture. Com-
paring Figure 5-1 with Figure 5-2, you
can see that one basic tonal adjust-
ment can also make the colors (such
as the shirt) seem richer and even
produce a perceived increase in
detail or sharpness (the fur at the
muzzle, ear, and top of her head).
You might hear a number of words
used for the same concept: the lightness and darkness of your image.
Tonality, luminosity, and even brightness can be used virtually interchange-
ably when you’re talking about the general subject. However, you generally
use brightness when talking about specific pixels and tonality when referring
to the image as a whole.
Figure 5-1: A nice snapshot, but not art.
Figure 5-2: One simple tonal adjustment
darkens, lightens, enriches color, and brings
out detail.

Histograms Simplified
In most photographs of general subject matter, your eye sees the darkest
neutral (gray) tone as black and the lightest neutral as white. (If the darkest
color is obviously purple and the lightest a bright yellow, you probably
wouldn’t classify the photo’s subject as “general.”) In a given image, the
shadow under the shoe might be just a dark gray, and the shirt looks like it
might need some bleach, but your eye (in cooperation with your mind) com-
pensates to some degree and lets you see black and white.
For a more accurate look at the tonal range of your image, Photoshop offers
the Histogram palette (found nested with the Navigator and Info palettes in
the upper-right corner of your screen), which displays the distribution of the
pixels in your image at various luminosity values. The darker pixels (shad-
ows) are stacked at the left end, the lighter pixels (highlights) are stacked at
the right end, and the rest of the brightness values (midtones) are stacked
between. The taller a column in the histogram, the more pixels at that lumi-
nosity value. Figure 5-3 shows an image with what some folks would call a
near-perfect histogram distribution because of the beautiful bell curve cen-
tered in the graph.
Figure 5-3: This image has a very even distribution of pixels through the midtones.
89
Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights

90
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
But don’t be seduced by a histogram distribution! Not every properly
exposed image has such a bell curve. Many perfect images have wildly differ-
ent histograms. The correct distribution in the histogram depends on two
things: the image content and the artistic aims of the artist.
Consider, if you will, an image that
consists primarily of white pixels, per-
haps a beautiful Alpine snow scene or
an ugly creepy-crawly thing on porce-
lain (as you can see in Figure 5-4).
Either image has a histogram skewed
dramatically to the right — what you
call a high-key image. Nothing is
wrong with the image (despite the his-
togram); it just happens to have a
huge number of light-colored pixels.
Likewise, a low-key image has a pre-
ponderance of dark pixels, which
skews the histogram to the left. Just
about any night scene has a very 
large number of very dark pixels,
pulling the distribution to the left in
the histogram. But many night scenes
also include lights, which produce a spike at the far right end.
Keep in mind, too, that the heights
of the individual columns in the his-
togram area are relative: The tallest
goes all the way to the top of the
box, and the others are scaled
accordingly. For example, an image
on a black background — say, a large
black background — might have so
many pixels in the left-most column
that the other columns in the image
appear tiny and almost unreadable,
like the histogram shown in
Figure 5-5.
If the histogram is skewed to one
end or the other, making it hard to
read, you can make a selection within the image and the histogram updates
to show information for only the selected area. (Read about making selec-
tions in Chapter 8.)
Figure 5-4: The histogram is skewed because
of the many white pixels. Or maybe it’s
running away.
Figure 5-5: Too many pixels in the left-most
column make the distribution for the midtones
hard to see.

Sometimes a histogram seems to tell you
absolutely nothing worthwhile. For example,
take the histogram in Figure 5-6. The image
doesn’t have a bell curve distribution, with a
gentle sloping to either side of the center peak.
It’s not a high-key image because the pixels
aren’t mashed together at the right. The image
is somewhat low-key, but the histogram doesn’t
have a huge stack at the left end. It does tell
you, however, that there are three distinct
ranges of tonality in which you find most of 
the image’s pixels.
When you click the triangle in the upper-right corner of the Histogram
palette, you can change the palette’s configuration. (So far in this chapter, I
show the Expanded View, which offers a little better look at the graph than
does the Compact View.) In this case, switching to the All Channels View,
which shows you a histogram for each color channel, helps solve The Mystery
of the Wacky Histogram (especially when seen with the image itself, as shown
in Figure 5-7). The image contains a large number of pixels of a rather consis-
tent color. If you mixed that color in the kitchen, the recipe would call for one
part red, two parts green, and four parts blue.
Figure 5-7: The All Channels View shows individual histograms for each color channel.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
As you read later in this chapter in the section “Level-headed you!,” you can
use the histogram to help avoid degrading your image while making adjust-
ments, and (as you read in Chapter 7) it’s very important for working with
the Camera Raw plug-in. But don’t forget about your eyeballs — you don’t
need the Histogram palette to spot a low-key or high-key image.
Using Photoshop’s Auto Corrections
Adjusting the tonality of your image can be as
simple as selecting one of the Auto commands
from Photoshop’s Image➪Adjustments menu. With
many photos, the tonality (and even the color)
jump to just the right look for your image. No
muss, no fuss — just a great-looking picture with
a single command.
If you need to do something special with the
image (for example, create an unusual effect), or
if the image is in bad shape to begin with, the
Auto commands might not be your best bet. But
remember this: It never hurts to try an Auto
command first. At worst, you use the Undo com-
mand, and you’ve wasted only a couple of sec-
onds and a pair of keystrokes.
From least sophisticated to most, here are your
three Auto correction choices:
 Auto Contrast: Auto Contrast makes the
dark pixels darker and the light pixels
lighter, and tries to avoid introducing any
color shift (an overall change in the color
appearance). The same adjustment is
applied to all three of your image’s color
channels. You can use Auto Contrast with
an image in which the colors already look
good and you perhaps just need a bit of a
boost to the contrast.
 Auto Levels: Each of your image’s color
channels gets its own adjustment, maximiz-
ing the tonal range in the channel. If one of
the color channels has very little to con-
tribute to the original image, a color cast (an
unwanted tint, as shown in Figure 5-8)
might be introduced. Auto Levels is fine for
most images that look good already and
don’t need to have exact colors.
Figure 5-8: The same photo, with
and without an orange color cast.

 Auto Color: Rather than using a single brightest pixel and a single dark-
est pixel to determine what should be white and what should be black,
Auto Color averages a few pixels at each end. That averaging prevents
one single stray pixel from throwing off the calculation used to adjust
your image. Auto Color is great for most typical images. You might need
that Undo command, however, on some photos with very brightly col-
ored objects or images that have extreme color casts.
Levels and Curves and You
Sometimes you need (or simply want) more control than offered by the Auto
commands. You might have a more demanding problem or a more expansive
artistic vision. You might need to make major corrections or create stupen-
dous effects. Photoshop, not surprisingly, offers that sort of control over
your image. In fact (and also not surprisingly), you have several ways at your
disposal to manipulate the tonality of your images. Two of the most com-
monly used are Levels and Curves, both found in your Image➪Adjustments
menu.
Before I introduce you to those two commands, let me quickly explain and
dismiss a couple of other available options. Since the early days of
Photoshop, the Brightness/Contrast command has lurked among the
Image➪Adjustments commands. In fact, it was the image adjustment com-
mand way back when. Now, however, the feature is somewhat lacking in con-
trol and sophistication and is perhaps of most use when fine-tuning an alpha
channel or layer mask. (Alpha channels are discussed in Chapter 8, and layer
masks appear in Chapter 10.) In both alpha channels and layer masks, you
use a grayscale representation to identify specific areas of your image.
Brightness/Contrast is perfectly adequate for many adjustments that you
might make to those channels.
Also of limited use is the Equalize adjustment. It finds the lightest pixel in the
image and calls that white, and also finds the darkest pixel and calls that
black. The rest of the pixels in the image are distributed between those
values, creating an extended tonal range. In practice, you’ll find that the
adjustment results in extreme highlights and extreme shadows, with a rather
garish image overall as well as a lack of details in the midtones.
Always keep in mind that you don’t have to make changes to the entire image.
If only part of an image needs repair, make a selection of that area before
opening the particular adjustment dialog box you want to use. (Read about
making selections to isolate areas of your image in Chapter 8.) Say, for exam-
ple, that you take a beautiful photo of a room in your house — “beautiful”
except that the view out the window is far too bright. Isolate the window with
a selection, and then use one of your image adjustment commands to tone it
down.
93
Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights

94
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
You can apply Levels, Curves, and Brightness/Contrast as adjustment layers.
Adjustment layers make the same changes to your images as the commands in
the Image➪Adjustments menu but are far more flexible. By double-clicking
the adjustment layer in the Layers palette, you can reopen the adjustment
dialog box and make changes to your settings. When you use an adjustment
layer, you can also restrict the effect of the adjustment to one or more layers
through layer clipping and layer sets. (See Chapter 8 for more information on
working with adjustment layers.) You can even delete an adjustment layer,
thus eliminating its effect on your image, by dragging it to the Trash icon at
the bottom of the Layers palette.
Level-headed you!
The Image➪Adjustments➪Levels command (Ô+L/Ctrl+L) gives you control
over shadows, highlights, and your image’s overall tonality individually.
Using a slider with three controls, you adjust the picture both to suit your
eye, and with an eye on a histogram for reference. You even have numeric
fields in which you can type exact values, should you find the need.
To perform the basic Levels correction, spreading the image’s tonality over
the full range of values available, you simply drag the slider controls under
the histogram in the Levels dialog box inward until they’re under the 
point where the histogram begins to rise in a mountain shape. Ignore those
little flat tails that extend outward — they represent individual stray pixels —
and drag the little pointers under columns that are at least a few pixels tall.
The histogram in the Levels dialog box (as shown in Figure 5-9) is for refer-
ence as you make changes. Note, however, that while you work in Levels, the
Histogram palette updates, showing you the “before” (in gray) and the “after”
(in black).
Figure 5-9: Compare the Levels histogram and the Histogram palette.

Dragging the middle slider to the right moves the bulk of the histogram
toward the left, indicating that the overall appearance of the image is slightly
darker.
Also note the lower Output Levels slider in Figure 5-9. You generally use that
only when preparing an image for a commercial printing press that requires
you to compress the image’s tonal range. Otherwise, ignore that slider and its
two fields except for special effects. And make a mental note of that pop-up
menu at the top of the Levels dialog box — you can apply Levels to each
color channel of your image individually, changing this tonal adjustment tool
to a color correction feature. (Fixing the color in your image is covered in
Chapter 6.)
When you’re working in Levels (or just about any dialog box), remember that
holding down the Option/Alt key changes the Cancel button to Reset. When
you click Reset, all values in the dialog box are restored to the defaults, let-
ting you start over without having to cancel and reselect the command.
95
Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
Defining white and black
The Options button in the Levels (and Curves)
dialog box opens a door through which you
might never need to walk. However, should
your path lead you to that door, I want you to
know what lies behind. Neither pit nor tiger
awaits you, only the possibility of controlling
your highlights and shadows — or making a
total mess of your image, of course. (Adobe
does a good job of hiding those it-could-cost-
me-a-fortune-if-I-screw-it-up features.) The
Options button gives you control over the
behavior of the Auto button (in both Levels and
Curves), but I suggest that you leave the
defaults alone. Even more importantly, the
Options button lets you define what colors
Photoshop should use for the lightest pixels
and for the darkest pixels. That’s right, white
and black are not always the same.
If you print to an inkjet, you want the full tonal
range of the printer, so you should leave white 
and black set to the extremes, as far apart as
possible. However, if you prepare images for
commercial offset presses, you might need to
adjust the values used for highlights and shad-
ows. If your white is too light, clouds and white
blouses and snow have no detail — they are
completely washed out. If your black is too
dark, every shadow is impenetrable, and
there’s no texture to the surface on which the
shadow falls.
If your print shop (or another person handling
your images prior to press) asks you to rede-
fine the highlights and shadows, open Levels
(or Curves), click the Options button, click the
highlight (white) color swatch to open the Color
Picker, and then input the suggested values.
Click OK and then repeat for the shadow
swatch. Make sure to click the buttons that
retain the values as your defaults as you OK
your way back out of all those dialog boxes.

96
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Earlier in this chapter, I mention that you can use the Histogram palette to
avoid introducing problems into the image. Note in Figure 5-9 that the
Histogram palette shows slight gaps appearing among the darker columns in
front. Technically called posterization, these gaps represent tonal values that
are being squished together into a single value. The pixels at one brightness
level are being shifted to the next higher or the next lower value, leaving that
empty column in the Histogram. Is this a problem? No, as long as you don’t
see wide gaps, representing a number of consecutive tonal values not in use.
(Extensive posterization ruins the subtle transitions between colors in your
image.) And that’s why you want to keep an eye on the Histogram palette —
to make sure you’re not creating wide gaps in the histogram and noticeable
posterization in your image.
Here is an easy way to minimize that posterization, one that lets you make
your Levels adjustment but keep a pretty histogram. Immediately after using
Levels, use the Edit➪Fade Levels command and change the blending mode
from Normal to Luminosity. As you see in Figure 5-10, the posterization goes
away with a minimal change in the effect of the Levels adjustment. Remember
that the Fade command is available only immediately after applying an adjust-
ment (or filter or tool) — you can’t even use the Save command between.
(Read more about the Fade command in Chapter 15.)
Figure 5-10: Change the Levels adjustment blending mode to Luminosity with Edit➪Fade.
Tonal corrections with the eyedroppers
The Levels dialog box (and the Curves dialog box, too) offers another way to
make tonal corrections to your image — sort of a half-automated technique,
using the three eyedroppers in the lower-right corner of the dialog box. Open
your image, open the Levels dialog box, and correct both tonality and color
in your image with three little clicks:

1. Click the left eyedropper on something that should be black.
This might be a shadow, a piece of clothing, or the tire of a car.
Generally, you click something in the image that’s already quite dark.
2. Click the right eyedropper on something that should be white.
A cloud, the bride’s dress, perhaps an eye . . . all are likely targets for the
highlight eyedropper. You usually click something that’s already quite
light.
3. Click the middle eyedropper on something that should be gray.
Click something that should be neutral in color. It doesn’t have to be
mid-gray, just something that should be neutral. This reduces or elimi-
nates any unwanted color cast in the image. If you don’t like the result,
click somewhere else in the image. Keep clicking until the colors in the
image look right.
In Figure 5-11, the shadow under the bridge, the splash of water, and the
weathered wood of the bridge itself provide excellent targets for the three
eyedroppers.
Figure 5-11: Use the eyedroppers in Levels to set the black and white points; then neutralize
your image’s colors.
Adjusting your curves without dieting
One step up from Levels in complexity, and about five steps ahead in terms of
image control, is Image➪Adjustments➪Curves (Ô+M/Ctrl+M). Like Levels,
you use Curves to adjust the tonality of your image. But rather than a slider
with three adjustment controls, the Curves dialog box offers you the chance
to control different parts of the tonal range independently. (Curves also
offers eyedroppers for tonal and color correction. They’re used the same way
you use the eyedroppers in Levels.)

Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights

98
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
At the very beginning of this chapter,
I show you how a simple tonal adjust-
ment could add some drama, some
interest to a rather bland image.
Figure 5-12 shows you the simple
Curves adjustment that I applied to
that image. Dragging the curve down-
ward in the shadows makes them
darker, dragging upward for the high-
lights makes them brighter. The mid-
tones (that section of the tonal range
between shadows and highlights)
also gets lightened a bit in this 
adjustment. 
When you first open the Curves
dialog box, you see a graph with a diagonal line running from an anchor point
in the lower left to another in the upper right. You click and drag that line up
or down (not sideways) to add anchor points and make changes in the curve
(and in your image). By default, the shadows are in the lower left, so dragging
down darkens, and dragging up lightens. (See that two-headed arrow directly
below the center of the graph? Click it to reverse the shadows and highlights
in the Curves dialog box.) You can add more than a dozen anchor points to
the curve — although you generally only need between one and three new
points.
Most snapshots can benefit from a slight tweak in Curves. Click at the inter-
section of the first vertical and horizontal gridlines in the lower left (the quar-
ter tones) and drag down slightly. The Input field should read 64, and the
Output field should be somewhere between 55 and 60 for a shot that looks
pretty good to start. Next, click at the intersection of the grid lines in the
upper right (the three-quarter tones) and drag up slightly. The Input field
should show 192, and the Output field can be anywhere from 195 to 205.
Both the Curves and Levels dialog boxes offer you the Load and Save but-
tons. If there’s a correction that you’ll use more than once, or a correction
that needs to be precise time after time, use the Save button. Then, later, you
can use the Load button to apply that adjustment to another image. If, for
example, you used the wrong setting in your camera while taking a series of
shots under the same lighting conditions, it’s probable that they all need the
same correction. Make the adjustment once, save it, and then apply it to the
other images with the Load button.
If you want to correct a specific area in the image, hold down the mouse
button and move the cursor into the image window (where it appears as the
Eyedropper tool). You’ll see a circle on the curve (like that near the middle of
the curve in Figure 5-13), telling you where those pixels fall in the tonal range.
To add an anchor point there, Ô-click/Ctrl-click in the image window.
Figure 5-12: Remember little Stella from the
beginning of the chapter?

When your curve has multiple
anchor points, the active anchor
point shows as a filled-in square.
Unselected anchor points are hollow
squares. For precision, you can use
the arrow keys on your keyboard to
move the active anchor point, or you
can type specific values in the Input
field (starting position for the anchor
point) and Output field (where you
want the anchor point to go).
You have a couple of ways to cus-
tomize the appearance of Curves,
too. Click the button in the lower-
right corner to toggle between the
standard-size dialog box and a larger
version. Option-click/Alt-click in the
grid area to toggle between a 4 x 4
grid and a 10 x 10 grid. And, rather
than clicking and dragging on the
curve, you can activate the Pencil 
tool (shown in Figure 5-14) and draw
your own curve by hand. When hand-
drawing your curve, you’ve got the
Smooth button available, too, to
ensure that the transitions in your
tonal adjustments are not too severe.
Grabbing Even
More Control
Photoshop CS2’s Image➪Adjustments menu includes a couple more,
extremely powerful, ways to work with tonality in your images. You can use
the Shadow/Highlight adjustment to isolate and change whatever range of
dark and light pixels you want. By specifying what range of tonal values that
you want to be considered dark or light, you control how broadly or narrowly
your change is applied. The Exposure feature lets you change the overall
tonality of the image, as if you’d taken the photo with a different camera set-
ting. And don’t forget about making spot corrections with the Dodge and
Burn tools!

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
The Shadow/Highlight and Exposure adjustments are not the same as working
with Raw images in the Camera Raw plug-in (see Chapter 7). Camera Raw
works with unprocessed image data, the so-called digital negative. Using
Photoshop’s Adjustment commands, you’re working with image data that has
already been manipulated in the camera, by Photoshop, or both. When work-
ing with unprocessed data in Camera Raw, you truly have control over the
exposure, the shadows, the highlights, and much more.
The Shadow/Highlight and Exposure adjustments are not available as adjust-
ment layers. Changes that you make with these features are a permanent part
of your image.
Using Shadow/Highlight
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is designed to rescue two specific sorts of
images — you’ve seen them (and maybe taken them): The background is per-
fectly exposed, and the person in the foreground is in horrible shadow. Or,
equally bad, the background looks great, but the subject is washed out by a
strong flash. (See both examples in Figure 5-15.) By controlling the shadows
and highlights separately from the rest of the image, this feature helps you
restore more balance to the image.
Figure 5-15: Shadow/Highlight does a rather good job with these all-too-common problems.

The default settings in Shadow/Highlight are intended to repair backlighting
problems, as you see on the left in Figure 5-15. When the foreground lacks
detail because of flash (as you can see on the right), minimize changes to the
shadows and drag the Highlights slider to the right. (Pay more attention to
the cheek than the neck — somebody needs a bath!) And, as you see in
Figure 5-16, the two sliders in Shadow/Highlight can be used together.
Figure 5-16: Some images need help for both shadows and highlights.
In the Shadows/Highlights dialog box, the Shadows slider lightens the darker
areas of your image, and the Highlights slider darkens the lighter areas.
Generally, you’ll use one slider or the other to fix a specific problem in an
image, but you can use both if you need to lighten shadows and tone down
highlights in the same image.
You’ll find that Shadow/Highlight is also a great tool for some other situa-
tions, especially when you select the Show More Options check box. Take a
look, for example, at Figure 5-17. In the “before” picture on the left, the inter-
esting subject matter is lost in the surrounding greenery. You don’t pick out
the sculpture immediately because both it and the leaves are rather dark. In
the “after” shot, lightening with the Shadows slider, lowering the Midtone
Contrast slider, and then boosting the saturation with the Color Correction
slider works wonders. By lightening and increasing the saturation, the greens
and browns separate themselves, helping you see the subject much better.

Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights

102
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 5-17: With lightening and saturation, Shadow/Highlight helps separate the subject and
foliage.
When you enable the Show More Options check box, Shadow/Highlight has a
rather intimidating set of controls. Not to worry! It’s actually pretty simple:
 Amount: For both Shadows and Highlights, the Amount slider is how
much of a correction you’re making. This is the nuts and bolts of the
Shadow/Highlight adjustment. For a backlit subject, you’ll use the
Shadows slider a lot and not the Highlights slider. When working with a
washed-out subject, you’ll probably move the Shadows slider to 0% and
work with the Highlights slider.
 Tonal Width: Use the Tonal Width sliders to specify how much of the
image’s tonal range you want to include as shadows or highlights. If you
drag either Tonal Width slider to 100%, you’re working on the entire
tonal range of the image — not a particularly appropriate job for
Shadow/Highlight (use Curves instead). The default of 50% is rather too
high most of the time. Instead, start your adjustment with a range of per-
haps 20% and fine-tune from there.

 Radius: You adjust the Radius sliders to tell Shadow/Highlight which
pixels should be identified as being in the shadow or highlight. With too
low of a Radius setting, an individual black pixel stuck in the middle of a
light area in your image might get classified as a shadow area. Too high
of a setting has a tendency to apply the adjustment to the entire image.
Generally speaking, start with a Radius of perhaps 10 pixels for very
small images and 30 pixels for large digital photos. After adjusting your
Amount and Tonal Width sliders, move the Radius slider back and forth
while watching some of the smaller patches of shadow or highlight
(whichever you’re correcting) to make sure that those areas are being
included in the adjustment.
 Color Correction/Brightness: This slider changes its name to match
your image’s color mode. When working with a color image, you see
Color Correction. When you apply Shadow/Highlight to a grayscale
image, the slider’s name changes to Brightness. Don’t bother with this
slider until you make your Amount adjustment. In a color image, lighten-
ing the shadows or darkening the highlights shows the actual color of
the pixels in those areas. Use this slider to increase (drag to the right) or
decrease (drag to the left) the saturation of those pixels. Remember that
Color Correction works only on the pixels that you identify with the
Tonal Width and Radius sliders. (If you set both sets of Tonal Width and
Radius sliders to 0%, Color Correction has no effect on the image at all.)
When you correct a grayscale image, on the other hand, the Brightness
slider affects all pixels except those that are already pure white or pure
black.
 Midtone Contrast: You can increase or decrease the contrast through-
out the image with the Midtone Contrast slider. Much like clicking in the
middle of the curve in Curves and dragging up or down, you adjust the
whole range of your image, including the shadows and highlights. When
the overall appearance of your image needs improvement, start with
Midtone Contrast and then work with your shadows and highlights 
individually.
 Clip: Most of the time, you don’t want to change the clipping values.
Clipping takes pixels that are almost black and forces them to pure black,
or takes pixels that are almost white and forces them to pure white.
Clipping your shadows or highlights reduces those subtle differences in
color that provide the detail in the shadows and highlights. When would
you want to clip shadows or highlights? When you don’t care about
detail in those areas of your image and need more contrast through the
midtones.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Changing exposure after the fact
Photoshop CS2 adds a new feature to the Image➪Adjustments menu called
Exposure. It simulates how the image would have looked if you changed the
exposure setting on your camera before clicking the shutter. Think of it as an
across-the-board adjustment of tonality in the image. As you can see in Figure
5-18, even a minor adjustment can have a major impact on the image!
Figure 5-18: With the Exposure adjustment, a little change goes a long way!
Earlier in this chapter, I mention that sometimes you want to apply an adjust-
ment to only part of an image. The windows in Figure 5-18 certainly qualify!
To best repair this image, I would make a selection of the windows, improve
their exposure, invert the selection (select the areas of the image other than
the windows), and correct the room separately. (Chapter 8 has all the info on
making selections.)

The Exposure dialog box offers a couple of additional controls, too. The
Shadows and Brightness sliders are designed primarily to work with very
high-bit images (the special 32-bit/channel high dynamic range images), and
you likely will find them too sensitive to be of much use.
Exposure is a rather specialized tool, and you probably won’t find it nearly as
user-friendly or effective as Curves and Shadow/Highlight. If you do actually
work with 32-bit/channel images, take it for a test drive; you might decide
that it fills a need.
Using Photoshop’s toning tools
You have a couple more ways to work with tonality in Photoshop — the
toning tools. These two brush-using tools let you paint corrections on your
image, giving you incredible control over the appearance. Select the Burn
tool to darken or the Dodge tool to lighten. Select a brush tip in the Options
bar and drag the tool in your image to apply the correction. (Read about 
controlling the brush-using tools — and that incredibly-complex Brushes
palette — in Chapter 14.) In Figure 5-19, you see the Burn tool darkening a
specific area of the fence on the right.
Figure 5-19: “Painting” the fence with the Burn tool — where is Tom Sawyer when I need him?
105
Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights

106
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
The Dodge tool is great for minimiz-
ing (without removing) shadows in
an image. You’ll find it particularly
useful for reducing wrinkles in faces
and other such jobs that require
lightening specific areas of an image.
Figure 5-20 compares the original
(left) with a working copy in which
I’m using the Dodge tool to reduce
the appearance of the wrinkles. By
reducing rather than eliminating
those wrinkles completely, I retain
the character of the man’s face as
well as prevent that phony just-out-of-plastic-surgery look.
For most of the work that you do with the Dodge and Burn tools, the default
Exposure setting of 50% is way too strong. In the Options bar, reduce the
Exposure to about 12–15% for most work. And unless you’re specifically
working on lightening shadows or toning down highlights, set the tools’
Range to Midtones in the Options bar.

n the end (and the middle and the beginning), your image in Photoshop is
nothing but little squares of color. Each square — each pixel — can be
exactly one color. Which color for which square is up to you. I’ll say it again:
There is no car or circle or tree or Uncle Bob in your Photoshop image — just
a bunch of little squares of color.
In this chapter, I explain how those squares of color are formulated, how
Photoshop works with those formulations, and — most importantly — how
you can manipulate the colors of those squares. Toward the end
of the chapter, you read about one of the biggest color-
related challenges in Photoshop: achieving accurate skin
color.
What Is Color in Photoshop?
Photoshop works with digital images (including digi-
tal photos, images that have been digitized with a
scanner, and artwork that you create from scratch in
Photoshop). The digits are the computer code used to
record the image’s information. The number of pixels,
the color of each pixel, and any associated information
are all recorded in a series of zeros and ones on your hard
drive. Color, therefore, is nothing more than numbers — at
least as far as Photoshop is concerned. For you and me, however,
color is far more than binary code on a hard drive. It’s the image, the 
artwork, the message. The artwork is color, and color is the artwork, pixel 
by pixel.

108
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Color modes, models, and depths
Photoshop records the color of each pixel in your image in any of several dif-
ferent ways. Every pixel in any given image has all color recorded in a single
color mode, which is the actual color format for the image file. While working
with your image you might, however, define specific colors in any of a variety
of color models, which are sort of the formula or recipes with which you mix
color. And an image can have only one color depth, which is the limitation on
the number of colors in an image.
Before I get into too many details, you need to understand one of the basic
concepts of color: gamut. Consider gamut to be the range of colors that can
be theoretically reproduced in a specific color mode or with a specific color
profile. A wide gamut, therefore, has many more colors available than does a
limited gamut. Those extra colors are generally the brighter, more vibrant
colors . . . the ones that make an image come alive. The red/green/blue (RGB)
color mode generally offers you a wider range of colors than does
cyan/magenta/yellow/black (CMYK). (See, for example, the comparison in
Figure 6-1.) And keep in mind that the specific color profile (the working
space that you select — see Chapter 4), also has an impact on the colors in
your image.
Figure 6-1: A wide-gamut image (on the left) and the same picture with a smaller gamut.

Which color mode should you choose?
If you’ll be printing to an inkjet printer or posting your image on the Web, you
need RGB color mode. (Despite the CMYK inks that you load into your inkjet
printer, the printer’s software expects — and must receive — RGB color
data.) If you’re prepping an image for inclusion in a page layout document
destined for a commercial offset press, you need CMYK. (You select the
image’s color mode from the Image➪Mode menu.) That’s the simple sum-
mary. Here’s a bit more detail, presented in the order in which you’re likely to
need the various color modes:
 RGB: RGB is the color mode for digital photos, computer monitors, the
World Wide Web, and inkjet printers. All colors are recorded as propor-
tions of the three component colors (red, green, and blue). RGB color is
recorded in the three color channels (described a bit later in this chap-
ter). RGB is an additive color mode — that is, the more of each compo-
nent color you add, the closer you get to white.
 CMYK: CMYK is used primarily
for printing on a commercial
offset press, but you might need
it for a color laser printer or a
high-end inkjet printer with
which you use a RIP (raster
image processor, which is a spe-
cialized bit of hardware or soft-
ware that lets your inkjet
pretend it’s a printing press).
CMYK is the color mode of mag-
azines, books, and other mass-
produced printed material (such
as the example in Figure 6-2).
CMYK is a subtractive color
mode — that is, the less of each
component color you have, the closer you are to white.
 Grayscale: When most people talk about a black-and-white photo, they
really mean grayscale. The image does contain black and white but also
a wide range of grays in between. You might use grayscale mode for
Web-based images or for prints. Keep in mind that unless your inkjet
printer is designed to reproduce grayscale images with black and gray
inks (or black and light-black inks), you probably won’t be happy with
grayscale output. Using just one black ink doesn’t reproduce the full
range of grays in the image. Using the color inks adds a tint to the image.
You do have an alternative for grayscale images: Send them to the local
photo lab for printing.

 Indexed Color: Using a color table, or list of up to 256 specific colors,
Indexed Color mode is for the Web. You save GIF and perhaps PNG-8
images in Indexed Color, but only those file formats require such a lim-
ited number of colors. Things like buttons on your Web page (which
need only a couple of colors) should be created as GIFs using Indexed
Color mode. That keeps the file size down, reducing the amount of space
the image requires on your Web server and also speeding the download
time (how long it takes for the image to appear on your site-visitor’s
monitor).
 L*a*b: Also known as Lab and CIELAB (and pronounced either lab, as
the dog or a research facility, or verbally spelled out, as el-ay-be), this is
a color mode that you might use when producing certain special effects
or using certain techniques in Photoshop, but it’s not one in which you’ll
save your final artwork. The three channels in an Lab image are
• Lightness, which records the brightness of each pixel
• a, which records the color of the pixel on a green-to-red axis
• b, which records each pixel’s color value on a blue-to-yellow axis
You shouldn’t print Lab images on an inkjet or post them on your Web
site. You might see (elsewhere!) a tip that you should convert your RGB
or CMYK images to Lab mode before using one of Photoshop’s Sharpen
filters. Bah! Apply the Unsharp Mask filter, use the Edit➪Fade Unsharp
Mask command, and change the blending mode from Normal to
Luminosity. Same result, less work, and less potential for degradation of
your image.
 Duotone: Duotone (including tritone and quadtone) is a very specialized
color mode, exclusively for commercial printing, that uses only two (or
three or four) inks spread throughout your image. Although that might
sound good for an inkjet printer, in fact, Duotone is not an acceptable
color mode for inkjets. Duotone images require that specific premixed
inks are poured into the presses, which isn’t something that you can do
to your inkjet.
 Multichannel: Like Duotone, Multichannel is a color mode restricted to
commercial printing because it depends on specific premixed colors of
ink that are applied to the paper. Unlike Duotone, in which the inks are
generally spread across the page, Multichannel images use certain inks
in certain areas. You might need Multichannel mode when creating a
logo for a client.
 Bitmap: Bitmap color mode is true black and white (as you see in Figure
6-3). Each pixel is either black or white. The placement of the black and
white pixels produces shading, but the image doesn’t really have any
gray pixels. You might use Bitmap mode to create images for some wire-
less devices, use on the Web, or commercial print, but that’s about it.

Converting between color modes or
gamuts (done with the Image➪Mode
menu) can reduce the quality of your
image by compressing different
colors into a single color value. You
would not, for example, want to con-
vert from RGB (which has a compara-
tively large number of colors
available) to CMYK (with a more
restricted color gamut) and then
back to RGB. After colors are com-
pressed by a conversion, you won’t
restore their original values by con-
verting back to a wider gamut.
Does a color model make a difference?
Although the image itself has a single
color mode, you can use any of the
available color models when defining
a color in Photoshop. Say, for exam-
ple, that you’re preparing to use the
Brush tool to paint some artistic ele-
ments for your latest project. The
project is in RGB mode because you’ll
be printing it with your inkjet printer.
You can use the Color palette to
define your foreground color any way
you please — RGB, CMYK, Grayscale,
Lab, or even HSB (hue/saturation/
brightness, which is not available as
a color mode, just a color model). It
doesn’t matter how you set up the
Color palette, which you do through the palette’s menu (as you see in Figure
6-4). When you add the color to your image, Photoshop uses the nearest RGB
(or CMYK) equivalent. (Notice, too, that the Color palette menu in Figure 6-4
doesn’t list Duotone or Multichannel. Those are color modes only, not color
models.)
Why should you worry about color depth?
Color depth is the actual number of different colors that you have available.
(Remember that each pixel can be only one color at any one time.) When you
work in 8-bit/channel color (simply called 8-bit color), each of the component
colors is recorded with exactly 8 bits of information in the computer file. 
(At the beginning of this chapter, I mention digits. These are the actual 
numbers — the zeros and ones recorded on the hard drive to track each
pixel’s color.) In an 8-bit RGB image, each pixel’s color is recorded with three
111
Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
Figure 6-3: Bitmap images contain only black
and white pixels: no grays, no colors.
Figure 6-4: Choose your preferred color model
from the Color palette menu.

112
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
strings of eight characters. When you work with 16-bit/channel (or 16-bit
color), each of the component colors is recorded with 16 characters. The
larger numbers mean more possible ways to record each color, which means
more possible variations of color (as well as files that take up more space on
your hard drive).
What that means to you, in practical terms, is possibly a better-looking image
when working in 16-bit color. You’ll have smoother transitions between
colors throughout your image, no banding in gradients (those annoying areas
in a gradient where you can actually see one color stop and the next color
start), and no splotchy shadows. Posterization, which I explain in Chapter 5,
is the degradation of your image’s appearance when similar colors are forced
to the same color, making transitions between colors more abrupt. Many
tonal and color corrections that produce posterization in your 8-bit images
won’t harm a 16-bit image in the least. Take a look at Figure 6-5. A Levels
adjustment is increasing the image’s tonal range. When the same adjustment
is applied to an 8-bit version of the image, some rather substantial posteriza-
tion becomes visible in the Histogram palette (represented by the empty
white gaps in the histogram).
Figure 6-5: Compare the Histogram palettes to see posterization (right).

So, should you use 16-bit color all the time? No. You can’t post a 16-bit image
on the Web, and 16-bit color is rarely used for CMYK images. Digital photos
taken in JPEG format are 8-bit (because that file format doesn’t support 16-bit
color). And with most inkjet printers, you won’t see any improvement in the
final print. (You might, however, see a dramatic increase in printing time
because there’s twice as much image data to process.)
If you shoot in 16-bit color, whether TIFF or Raw, it makes sense to process
the image in 16-bit color. When the image is perfect, you might want to con-
vert a copy of the file to 8-bit color for printing (Image➪Mode➪8-Bits/
Channel). You might find some situations in which you’ll convert an 8-bit
image to 16-bit. Switching from 8-bit to 16-bit doesn’t help you avoid posteri-
zation, but it might reduce banding if you add a sizable gradient.
One other note on color depth: Photoshop CS2 can work with 32-bit/channel
images. These monstrous files are called high dynamic range (HDR) images
and are typically constructed by combining different exposures of the same
photo. In Photoshop CS2, you can work with a pair of exposures in the Merge
to HDR feature (presented in Chapter 10). You probably will never be called
upon to create an HDR image for any of the esoteric 3-D or video programs
that use them, but you might find some benefit in combining multiple expo-
sures of a difficult shot. Afterward, so that you have a file of reasonable size
and access to more of Photoshop’s features, use the Image➪Mode menu to
convert to16-bit color or even 8-bit color.
Recording color in your image
All your image’s color data is saved in the Channels palette. When you’re work-
ing with RGB or CMYK images, each color channel holds information for one of
the component colors (red/green/blue or cyan/magenta/yellow/black). Each
channel is a grayscale version of the image as a whole, using shades of gray,
from white to black, to indicate where that channel’s color appears (and how
strongly) in the image. In RGB images, the lighter the pixel in a channel, the
more of that color. When you work with a CMYK image, the light-dark in a chan-
nel is reversed, with darker areas showing where more of that color is applied.
Color Adjustments in Photoshop
Sometimes you have an image that needs some help in the color department.
It might have been shot with an incorrect camera setting, it might have a
color cast (an unwanted tint of a specific color), or it might just be dull and
dingy. Photoshop provides you with an incredible array of commands and
tools to make the colors in your images look just right. You’ll hear the term
color correction being tossed about, but not all images have incorrect color.
Some have very good color that can be great color. Instead of color correc-
tion, I like to think in terms of color improvement. And just about every image
can use a little tweaking to improve its color.

Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
“Here, Spot!” What is a spot color?
Spot colors in your image are printed by using premixed inks of exactly that color. (We’re talking
commercial printing press here, not your run-of-the-mill inkjet printer.) To properly prepare a spot
color for press, it needs to be in its own spot channel, which is a separate color channel in which
you show where and how the ink will be applied. (Channels in your image are eventually used to
create the actual printing plates that pick up ink and put it on paper.) Because spot channels are
used with CMYK images, dark represents more. Where you need the spot color at 100% strength,
paint directly in the spot channel with black. In areas where you want only a light tint of the spot
color, use a light gray.
You create your spot channel by selecting the Spot Channel command from the Channels palette
menu. Click the color swatch in the New Spot Channel dialog box to open the color libraries. (If you
see the regular Color Picker, click the Color Libraries button.) Select the appropriate book (collec-
tion of colors; see the figure here) for your project; then select your color. Click OK in the New Spot
Channel dialog box to accept the color, do not change the name of the spot channel, and then click
OK. You can now paint or copy/paste into that new channel.
When saving images with spot channels, you can use the PSD file format (if the image will be
placed into an InDesign document), PDF, TIFF, or DCS 2.0. Check with the person handling the layout
or the print shop to see which is required.
How do you know when the color is right? Your primary tool for the
job is in your head. Literally. Make your decisions based primarily on
what your eyes tell you. Sure, you can check the Info palette and the
Histogram palette to make sure that your shadows are black and
your highlights are white, but adjust your images until they look
good to you — until you’re satisfied with the color.

That little icon to the left is a little scary, but it does get your attention, 
doesn’t it? This isn’t a your-computer-will-blow-up sort of warning but more
of a you-don’t-want-to-waste-your-time-and-effort warning. Do your tonal
adjustments before you start working with the image’s colors. Go through the
procedures in Chapter 5 first and then use the techniques here. Why? If you
get perfect hue and saturation and then start making tonal adjustments,
you’re likely to knock your colors out of whack again. And, of course, there’s
also the possibility that adjusting your image’s tonality will make the colors
look perfect!
Watching the Histogram and Info palettes
As you work with your various color adjustments in Photoshop, a couple of
palettes can help you track the changes you’re making. The Info and
Histogram palettes are, by default, nested in the upper-right corner of your
screen. (You can also show or hide them through Photoshop’s Window
menu.) You might want to drag one or the other out of the nested set so that
both are visible at the same time. (Click the palette’s tab and drag it away.)
Keeping an eye on your Info and Histogram palettes while you’re dragging
sliders and entering numbers into various fields can help you spot potential
problems before they develop.
The Histogram is useful for tracking changes in the distribution of pixels at
various tonal ranges. You can read more about it in Chapter 5. The Info
palette, while you’ve got an adjustment dialog box open, shows you “before”
and “after” color values. Wherever you move the cursor in the image window
(it will appear as the Eyedropper tool), the Info palette shows you the result
of the adjustment — the consequences of your action, so to speak. You can
also hold down the Shift key to change to the Color Sampler tool. Clicking in
the image with the Color Sampler adds up to four markers in the image. The
color values under those markers appear in the Info palette and, like the
cursor location, show before/after values as you’re making changes (see
Figure 6-6).

Choosing color adjustment commands
Photoshop offers over a dozen different com-
mands that you can use to improve the appear-
ance of your images, all of which are easily
accessed through the Image➪Adjustments
menu (as you see in Figure 6-7). Some have spe-
cialized purposes, and some are extremely ver-
satile, but all are worth understanding so that
you choose the most appropriate feature for the
problem staring at you from the screen. Most
(but not all) of the commands that I discuss
here can be added to your images as an adjust-
ment layer, which gives you added flexibility.
(Adjustment layers are discussed in detail in
Chapter 8.)
Figure 6-7: Photoshop’s flexibility
is truly evident in the Image➪
Adjustments menu.

Auto Color
Auto Color is perhaps the simplest way to improve both color and tonality
(the darkness of the shadows and the brightness of the highlights). Select the
command, and Photoshop automatically finds the lightest and darkest pixels
in the image. Then, on a channel-by-channel basis, it redistributes the values
of the remaining pixels. For more information on Auto Color and the related
Auto Contrast and Auto Levels commands, take a look at Chapter 5.
Curves
The Curves command is also discussed at length in Chapter 5. However, for
color correction (rather than tonal adjustment), you want to work on each
channel individually, choosing each in
turn from the pop-up menu at the top of
the Curves dialog box (see Figure 6-8).
Although working on each channel with
Curves can be very effective, it can also
be rather time consuming, with lots of
flipping back and forth among the chan-
nels as one adjustment makes another
channel correction look like a bad deci-
sion. While it may be inconvenient,
Curves is a very powerful color correc-
tion tool.
Color Balance
The Color Balance command (as shown
in Figure 6-9) presents you with three
sliders that you use to make changes to
the balance between your color oppo-
sites. If the image is too blue, you drag
the third slider away from Blue and
toward Yellow. (And this is a great way
to remember which colors are opposite
pairs!)
You can control the highlights, mid-
tones, and shadows of your image indi-
vidually by using radio buttons at the
bottom of the Color Balance dialog box.
And, in almost all cases, you’ll want to
leave the Preserve Luminosity check
box marked so that the brightness of
the individual pixels is retained.

Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural

with Curves to adjust color in your image.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
You can also use Color Balance to throw an image out of whack for special
effects or (getting back to the adjustment’s roots) compensating for a color
cast being introduced by the printing device.
Figure 6-9: Color Balance gives you direct control over opposites.
Hue/Saturation
Often overlooked and rarely
exploited to the fullest, Hue/
Saturation is a very powerful tool.
Using the three sliders together, you
can adjust the hue to eliminate a
color cast, increase saturation so that
your colors appear richer and more
vibrant, and adjust lightness to
improve your image’s tonality. (See
Figure 6-10.) Keep in mind that when
you adjust something that’s very
dark, start with the Lightness slider so
that you can evaluate the other
changes (Hue and Saturation) properly.
Remember, too, that you can apply Hue/Saturation (like a number of other
adjustments) to a specific range of colors in the image, selected in the pop-up
menu at the top of the dialog box.
Figure 6-10: Hue/Saturation cures three
problems at once.

If you need to simulate a duotone image (a picture created by using just two
inks), apply a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer, mark the Colorize check box,
adjust the sliders, save, and then print. If the inkjet printer introduces a color
cast that changes the appearance of the image, reopen the adjustment layer
and make the change necessary to compensate for the color cast.
Desaturate
Photoshop’s Desaturate command creates a
grayscale representation of a color image with-
out changing the color mode. This can be an
extremely cool technique when you make a
selection first, leaving some of the image in
color and converting some to a simulated
grayscale, as shown in Figure 6-11. However,
there are better ways to go from color to
grayscale, such as using the Channel Mixer
(which I discuss later in this chapter).
Match Color
Now this is a feature to savor! There you are,
adding Cousin Joe to the family photo (he wasn’t bailed out in time), and you
see that the lighting is all kinds of different and he sticks out like a sore
thumb (or bum). Or you return from a major shoot, only to find that some-
thing wasn’t set correctly in the camera, and all your images have a nasty
color cast.
Match Color lets you adjust one image to another (and you can even use
selections to identify areas to adjust or areas of the images to use as the
basis for adjustment), but keep in mind that you get better results with
images that are already rather similar. You can also fix one shot and use that
shot as a standard by which others are corrected. (Like most image adjust-
ments, you can record a change in an Action and use Photoshop’s Batch com-
mand to apply that adjustment to a series of images. Read more about
Actions in Chapter 16.) Take a look at Figure 6-12 to see the Match Color
dialog box.
Because it’s such a powerful tool, it’s worth taking at look at what’s going on
in the Match Color dialog box:
 Ignore Selection When Applying Adjustment: If you have an active
selection in the target layer or image (for calculating the adjustment, see
the upcoming bullet on that) and you want the adjustment to be applied
to the entire target, select this check box. If the box is left clear, the
adjustment is applied only within the selection. Note that you can use
selections to apply Match Color to only a portion of your image (such as
flesh tones), or you can adjust sections of the image one at a time.

to desaturating.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 6-12: Matching the gator to the grass improves the lighting and his chances of lunch.
 Luminance: After the preview shows in your image window, you can
tone down or brighten up the target area with the Luminance slider.
 Color Intensity: Think of this slider as a saturation adjustment.
 Fade: Using Fade lets you blend the adjustment, reducing its intensity.
 Neutralize: If a color cast is introduced by the adjustment, marking the
Neutralize check box might eliminate it.
 Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colors: You can make a selection
in the image to which you’re trying to match (the source) and use the
colors within that selection as the basis for the Match Color calculation.
In Figure 6-12, an area of grass is selected on the lower layer so that the
color of the dog and the bottle are not taken into account.
 Use Selection in Target to Calculate Adjustment: You can make another
selection in the target layer or image that presents Match Color with a
sample of those pixels to use for calculating the adjustment.
 Source: The Source pop-up menu lists all the open images that can be
used as a basis for adjustment. Only images of the same color mode and
color depth get listed. In the sample, the image itself is the source so
that I can pick a specific layer to match. Think of source as the image
whose colors you’re matching. (The selected image or the active layer
within an image is what you’re adjusting.)
 Layer: When a multilayer image is selected in the Source pop-up menu,
you can designate which layer (or a merged copy of the layers) is the
actual source. In the example, the lower layer — the layer with the 
grass — is the source.

 Load Statistics/Save Statistics: If you’re doing a series of images and you
want to speed things up, click the Save Statistics button to record the
adjustment you’re making and then use the Load Statistics button with
other images.
In Figure 6-12, an area of alligator scales is selected on the target layer and an
area of grass is selected on the source layer. With the two selections, I tell
Match Color to adjust the target layer based on the difference between the
grass and the scales. But with the Ignore Selection When Applying Adjust-
ment check box enabled as well, I make sure the entire target layer is
adjusted. I could, however, make a selection of all the target layer except the
tongue, clear the Ignore Selection When Applying Adjustment check box in
Match Color, and have the adjustment applied only to the critter’s hide.
Replace Color
Sort of a cross between the Select➪Color Range command (see Chapter 8)
and the Hue/Saturation adjustment, Replace Color is a great tool for swap-
ping out one color for another. It’s truly great in a production environment
where, for example, a certain blouse is available in several colors. Shoot one
color, and then use Replace Color to produce the additional product shots.
The Replace Color dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-13, has two separate
parts: Selection and Replacement. Click with the left eyedropper, in either the
preview area or in the image windows, and adjust the Fuzziness slider (how
much variation counts as “selected”) to make your initial selection. Use the
middle eyedropper to add additional colors (or shades of your initial color),
and use the right eyedropper to subtract from the selection. (Choose only
variations of one color.) Then drag those Hue, Saturation, and Lightness slid-
ers in the Replacement section of the dialog box to produce your new look.
Rather than switching eyedroppers back and forth, use the left eyedropper
and the Shift key (to add) and the Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) key (to sub-
tract). You can also hold down the Shift key and drag through an area to
select all the colors in the area. If you accidentally select some colors you
don’t want, release the Shift key and click once to start over.
Selective Color
Although designed to help you compensate for the vagaries of printing
presses, Selective Color can do other great things for you! The command’s
dialog box, which you can see in Figure 6-14, has a pop-up menu that offers the
six basic colors of Photoshop, as well as Whites, Neutrals, and Blacks. You
select which range of colors to adjust and then drag the sliders. You can work
on one set of colors, switch to another and make adjustments, switch to
another, and so on without having to click OK in between. For example, you can
adjust the reds in the image and leave the blues untouched, or you can adjust
the reds and then tweak the blues without having to exit the dialog box.

When you have reasonably small adjustments to make, select the Relative
radio button at the bottom. If you’ve got substantial changes — rather radical
alterations — select the Absolute radio button.
Figure 6-14: The excessive red is easily eliminated without changing anything else.

Channel Mixer
Designed to repair a defective channel in an image, Channel Mixer lets you
use sliders to replace some or all of the intensity of one color channel with
content from the others. Should you come across an image with damage in
one channel, you can certainly use the Channel Mixer adjustment to work on
it (with some degree of success). You reduce the value of the target channel
by dragging the slider to the left. You then drag one or both of the other slid-
ers toward the right. Generally speaking, you want to add an amount (com-
bined between the two other channels) just about equal to what you subtract
from the target channel.
If you drag a slider to the left past 0 (zero), you invert the content of the
channel. You can produce some incredible (and incredibly weird) effects with
this technique, partially inverting one or two channels. When you get a
chance, give it a try.
There is one thing that Channel Mixer does incredibly well, and it’s even
practical, too. You can create grayscale versions of your images in a variety
of ways in Photoshop — by choosing Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate or
Image➪Mode➪Grayscale, for example, or by deleting channels, using the 
L channel of a Lab image, and so forth. But none of those techniques quite
compares to creating grayscale with the Channel Mixer. Here’s how you do it:
1. Open the image in Photoshop and evaluate the color channels.
Start with a flattened 8-bit RGB image. Take a look at each channel indi-
vidually by clicking it and hiding the other two color channels by click-
ing the eyeball icon to the left of each. See which channel holds detail
information for which part of your image. Foliage, for example, will usu-
ally be most prominent in the Green channel.
Make sure to click the RGB channel when you’re done evaluating, or the
Channel Mixer won’t be available.
2. Open the Channel Mixer.
Use the menu command Image➪Adjustments➪Channel Mixer. (The
Channel Mixer is also available as an adjustment layer.)
3. Select the Monochrome check box.
When you select the Monochrome option (lower-left corner of the dialog
box), you’re telling the Channel Mixer that you want one single channel
when you’re finished with the adjustment. (Although this discussion is
about creating a tremendous grayscale image, that resulting channel
could be used in a variety of ways in other images, perhaps as an alpha
channel or a spot color channel.)
123
Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural

124
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
4. Adjust the sliders to create a great grayscale image.
Start with the three channel sliders at +40 and the Constant slider at
about –7. Now play with the sliders, keeping in mind your evaluation of
the individual channels. Generally speaking, for a well-exposed original,
the total value of the sliders’ fields should be about 100. (Count the
Constant slider at triple its value because it changes all three channels.)
When your image looks great, click OK. In Figure 6-15, the emphasis is on
the Green channel to maintain the detail in the trees.
Figure 6-15: The Channel Mixer’s Monochrome option lets you control your grayscale
conversion.
5. Save as Grayscale.
Use the Image➪Mode➪Grayscale command to convert to true grayscale
(the Channel Mixer leaves the image in RGB mode), and then save. Make
sure that you change the name or location so you don’t overwrite your
original image!

Gradient Map
More creative than corrective, the Gradient Map feature re-creates your
image by using a gradient. The left-most color stop (the anchor points where
a gradient color is assigned) in the gradient is mapped to the shadows, the
right-most to the highlights, and any color stops in between are appropriately
assigned to the rest of the tonal range. In Figure 6-16, you can see how a two-
color gradient (upper-left) lacks detail compared with the four-color gradient
being created for the lower image.
Figure 6-16: Using more colors in your gradient produces more detail.
Generally speaking, you use darker colors for the color stops on the left and
lighter colors for the color stops on the right (although extremely interesting
effects can be created by mixing things up). Using a black-to-white gradient
produces a grayscale image.
To edit the gradient, simply click directly on the sample gradient in the
Gradient Map dialog box. Click to add color stops, drag to move color stops,
and click the color swatch near the bottom to change the color of the
selected stop. (You can find more detailed information on creating and work-
ing with gradients in Chapter 14.)

Photo Filter
Photoshop’s Photo Filter is indeed an image adjustment rather than a filter.
The filter in the name refers to those actual photographic filters that you screw
onto the end of a lens. This adjustment is a great way to correct problems with
temperature in an image — that perceived warmth or coldness of an image.
When the camera takes a picture under unexpected lighting conditions, a color
problem is apparent. (Say, for example, that the camera is set to Daylight when
shooting indoors.) When an image is too blue, it’s too cool; conversely, an
image that’s orangey is too warm. (Remember that these are the perceptual
evaluations — blue light is technically hotter than yellow or red light.)
In Photo Filter, you select a preset filter from a pop-up menu or select a color
of your choice. As you can see in Figure 6-17, both preset filters and custom
colors can be effective in neutralizing a color cast. (You could, of course, also
use these filters to add a color cast . . . if you wanted to, that is.)
Figure 6-17: Neutralize a color cast with a filter of the opposite color in Photo Filter.

Shadow/Highlight
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is
discussed at length in Chapter 5 as a
tonal correction tool (the job for
which it was designed). However,
keep in mind that the Shadow/
Highlight dialog box also includes the
Color Correction slider. After you
lighten shadows or tone down high-
lights, you can increase or decrease
the saturation of the colors in the
adjusted areas of your image with the
Color Correction slider.
Invert
Again, more creative than corrective,
the Invert command (no dialog box)
simply reverses the colors in your
image or the selected area. Although
inverting areas of an image (like
desaturating) can draw attention to
the subject of the image, it’s an edgier
technique and generally requires
touch-up after inverting. You’ll find
that any specular highlight — a pure-
white area (mainly reflections) —
becomes a distracting black spot.
Posterize
The Posterize command forces your
image’s broad range of colors into a
few selected colors (as shown in
Figure 6-18). You automatically get
black and white, and then a limited
number of additional colors, based
on the content of the original. You
pick the number of colors that you
want to use, and Photoshop picks
which colors to use. You can use as
few as two colors (plus black and
white) or as many as 255 (which
pretty much gives you your original
image). Posterize can create a rather
pleasing rendering of a photo with
very few colors.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
When experimenting with Posterize, click in the Levels field and use the up-
and down-arrow keys on your keyboard to preview different numbers of
colors. Start low and work your way up. If you see something that you like,
you can stop or you can keep going and come back to that number later —
the image will look exactly the same when you try that number again.
Working with Variations
The Variations feature, which you find in the Image➪Adjustments menu, is a
semi-automated way to make color and tonal adjustments to your images.
You open the image, open Variations, and then click which version looks
better. (See Figure 6-19).
Figure 6-19: You use Variations to click your way to a perfect picture.
Much like getting new eyeglasses, using Variations is a matter of “Which
looks better, this or this? ” When you click one of the images, it moves to the
Current Pick position, and a new set of variations is automatically generated.
The blue areas that you see in some of the options in Figure 6-19 indicate
areas where colors will be clipped — forced into black in the shadows or to

white in the highlights — which results in a loss of detail in the image. You
can disable that feature by clearing the Show Clipping check box in the upper
right. Also note that you can adjust the shadows, midtones, and highlights
independently, and you can also control (to some degree) the amount of vari-
ation from sample to sample.
Start with the Fine/Coarse slider set somewhere in the middle and get reason-
ably close to a great image, correcting midtones, shadows, highlights, and
then saturation. Now drag that slider to the Fine setting and zero in on a per-
fect image.
Manual corrections in individual channels
Sometimes different areas of an image require different corrections or adjust-
ments. You can, for example, “paint” corrections into specific areas of a chan-
nel by using the toning tools in Photoshop’s Toolbox. The image in Figure
6-20 has a distinct problem (okay, well, maybe a few problems). In the lower
left is a light-green blob that needs to be eliminated if there’s any chance of
salvaging this photo. By using the Burn tool on one channel at a time, you
can darken that specific area of each channel — each channel according to
its needs.
Figure 6-20: The problem is only in one area of each channel, but it can be fixed manually.
129
Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural

130
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
On the left, you can see the distinct light area in the thumbnail of each chan-
nel. On the right, after using the Burn tool, those lighter areas are gone, and
so is the, the . . . what could it have been? Was it perhaps swamp gas?
Ectoplasm? A UFO? Anyway, it’s gone now, and the tabloids won’t buy the
photo for millions of dollars.
In addition to the Burn tool, you can use the Dodge, Blur, Sharpen, and
Smudge tools. You can use the Brush tool and paint with black, white, or
gray. You can use Levels or Curves on an individual channel or even a selec-
tion within one or more channels. When fine-tuning (or salvaging) an image,
don’t be afraid to work in one channel at a time, perfecting that channel’s
contribution to the overall image.
Take another look at the two Channels palettes shown in Figure 6-20.
(Obviously that’s a composite image because there’s only one Channels
palette in Photoshop, right?) On the right, the Green channel is active (you
can tell because it’s highlighted), and only the Green channel is visible (only
it shows the eyeball icon to the left). The other channels are invisible, and
you see only the grayscale representation from the Green channel in the
image window. On the left, however, only the Red channel is active, but all
the channels are visible. Any change I make to that image in that state is
applied only to the Red channel. But because all channels are visible, I can
see the overall impact on my image. Sometimes you want only one channel
visible (when trying to balance the tonal range throughout the channel, for
example), but most of the time, you want to see what’s going on in the image
as a whole. Click the one channel (or Shift-click two channels) in which you
need to work. Then click in the left column next to the composite channel at
the top to make all channels visible.
The People Factor: Flesh Tone Formulas
One of the toughest (yet one of the most important) jobs in Photoshop is
making sure that skin looks right. People come in a wide variety of colors and
shades and tints, and each person varies in color in different places on their body
and at different times of the year. (The top and bottom of your forearm are likely
different colors, and the difference is generally much greater in summer than in
winter.) There are even some exceptions to those broad generalities. Making skin
tones look great is often a major challenge, yet often a critical challenge.
When you’ve got skin in your image, it’s generally part of the focus of the
image — the person whom you’re photographing. And even when a person
isn’t the subject of the image, skin attracts attention in the image. The eye natu-
rally goes to people in just about any image (perhaps not first, but eventually).

You’ll also find that unnatural variations in skin color are very noticeable.
Consider how often you think to yourself that someone looks a little pale, or
flushed, or sunburned, or tanned, or just plain sick. You’re making that judg-
ment call based (at least to a large degree) on the appearance of the skin.
Keeping in mind that the numbers shown in Figure 6-21 are general guidelines
and that real people vary quite a bit, I’ve prepared for you some target values
for skin tones. Use these formulas loosely when using the techniques in this
chapter to adjust the color in your images, keeping in mind the individual
you photographed and the lighting at the time.
Figure 6-21: These are guidelines only, not absolute values!
Note that the numbers are CMYK, even for use with RGB images. Open the
Info palette menu, choose Palette Options, and set the Second Color Readout
to CMYK (see Figure 6-22). Remember, too, that you can use color samplers
as placeholders in the image, monitoring the changes that you’re making in
the Info palette. Set the color sampler readings to CMYK in the Info palette
itself by clicking the eyedropper symbol to the left of the color mode listed
for each sampler.
Promise me that you’ll keep in mind that these numbers are for reference
only? Your individual image determines what the correct adjustment should
be. You can use these numbers as a starting point, but trust your eyes and
evaluate your image as you work.

 Taking advantage of the Raw file format
 Evaluating your Raw capabilities
 Using the Camera Raw plug-in
T
here was a time, not so long ago in people years (but a couple of genera-
tions ago in computer years), when capturing digital photos in the Raw
file format required you to spend tens of thousands of dollars. The wonderful
thing about the Raw file format is that you use it to record images to save
unprocessed image data, which gives you incredible control over the final
appearance of your image. These days, however, cameras costing only a few
hundred dollars can capture images “in the Raw.” (And that’s the naked
truth!) If you don’t have a Raw-capable camera now, after reading this 
chapter, you might decide that you need to have Raw capability.
In this chapter, I explain how Raw differs from other image
file formats and why those differences can be important.
I show you how to determine whether you have what
you need to capture in Raw — and whether the
Photoshop CS2 Camera Raw plug-in is capable of
handling your camera’s image files. Most of the rest
of the chapter looks at the Camera Raw interface
and what all those sliders do for you and for your
image.
Understanding the Raw Facts
The Raw file format at its heart is nothing but unprocessed
image data. It comes in a number of variations — one or several for
each camera manufacturer, it seems. Each has its own file extension (such as
.crw, .cr2, or .nef), and many have their own special features that are
totally incompatible with each other. And those camera manufacturers love
to tinker with their proprietary formats, changing them regularly. But each of
the formats, at the basic level, is Raw. (Check your camera’s User Guide to

134
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
see if it is capable of recording image data in a format other than JPEG or
TIFF. If so, it’s probably a variation of Raw.)
Thankfully, Adobe updates the Camera Raw plug-in for Photoshop (as shown
in Figure 7-1) on a regular basis, adding the capability to work with the
newest cameras shortly after they’re available. (Plug-ins, like Camera Raw
and most of Photoshop’s filters, extend the program’s capabilities. Updating
your plug-ins regularly ensures you have the greatest capabilities.) Be
warned, however, that purchasing a new model the day it comes on the
market might mean using the camera’s own software for a while until Camera
Raw is updated.
Figure 7-1: The impressive Camera Raw window, explained fully in this chapter.
What’s the big deal about Raw?
Cameras that record images using the Raw format save unprocessed image
data. When recording as TIFF or JPEG, the camera manipulates the image
data, processing it in a variety of ways. So what’s the big deal with prepro-
cessing — Raw — image data? Assuming that you’re as hungry for food as for
knowledge, I’ll use a cooking analogy.

Say you purchase frozen lasagna and heat it up in your microwave oven. It
probably tastes good and fulfills your needs (“Food!”). However, the chef who
designed this prepared meal and the good folks who churn it out use a spe-
cific recipe designed to appeal to a large number of people, hopefully offend-
ing very few. When you reheat your lasagna in the microwave, you have some
choices. For example, you decide how warm to make it (generally following
the package’s reheating instructions). Or, you can add some salt and pepper
to season to taste, or perhaps dump on the hot sauce.
What you can’t do with that frozen lasagna is take out some of the salt (or fat)
in it from the recipe designed by the chef and prepared by the good folks.
You can’t substitute olive oil for butter. You can’t cut back on the garlic a bit
(just in case your date goes well). You’re pretty much restricted by what the
original chef (and his good folks) prepared. Sure, you could pour a half-bottle
of blue food coloring over it, creating a special effect, but you’re not likely to
turn that microwavable lasagna into a gourmet dinner.
And that’s what Raw is all about! If you’re just hungry and your demands are
not too severe, no problem — shoot JPEG (the digital photo equivalent of a
microwave meal). If, on the other hand, you consider yourself a gourmet
chef, creating art from virtually nothing, Raw is the format for you. Avoid the
limitations put on your image editing by preprocessing and dive right in with
the greatest flexibility. (And you don’t even have to go down to the Farmers’
Market for fresh tomatoes.)
Working in Raw
There’s one critical difference between working with Raw images and working
with JPEGs or TIFFs — you never actually make changes to the Raw file.
Instead, you record your adjustments in the image’s metadata (non-image
data recorded with the image data) or in a sidecar file (a separate file in
which Photoshop records any information that can’t be recorded in the meta-
data). (Sidecar files have the same name as the image file, but use the .xmp
file extension. Keep each sidecar file in the same folder as the image with
which it is associated.) Because adjustments are recorded separately rather
than applied to the images, the original image data remains unchanged, wait-
ing for you to create again and again, all from the same unprocessed, unde-
graded image data.
Photoshop’s Save As dialog box offers you the option of the Photoshop Raw
file format. Photoshop Raw is not compatible with the Camera Raw plug-in
and does not provide you with the benefits of using the Raw format with your
digital camera. It is, however, necessary for certain high-end graphics and
animation programs into which someone, somewhere, sometimes places
images from Photoshop.
135
Chapter 7: Hur-RAW for the Home Team!

136
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
When capturing in Raw, you can basically ignore all the camera’s settings
other than aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and (of course) focus. Everything
else can be adjusted in the Camera Raw plug-in. However, because Raw
devotes significantly more resources to recording highlights than shadows,
it’s not a bad idea to concentrate on those highlights when shooting. When
the highlights are great to start with, you can reallocate some of the image’s
tonal range to the deprived shadows, thus reducing unwanted digital noise
and increasing detail.
The DNG file format
In late 2004, Adobe Systems, Inc. announced a
new open standard (anybody can use it without
licensing fees) for Raw photos. The DNG (digital
negative) file format adheres to the basic Raw
formulation but does allow for growth. The aim
is to ensure that years from now, you’ll still be
able to open and process the images you shot
yesterday. (Unfortunately, changes in camera-
specific versions of Raw already make some
early Raw photos inaccessible by today’s soft-
ware — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg!)
Adobe promises to continue support for 
backward-compatible DNG file processing in
the future and makes the Adobe Digital
Negative Converter software (as shown here)
available for free. Although the hope is that
camera manufacturers will adopt DNG as their
cameras’ own version of Raw, only time will tell.
(Note that even if you convert copies of your
images to DNG, Adobe recommends that you
keep the original Raw files, just in case.)

Keep in mind that in addition to the Photoshop CS2 Camera Raw plug-in, you
also have available the software that came with your camera. (And you might
even have additional software packages available, depending on what camera
make and model you have at your disposal.) Which package is best? As usual,
best is a relative term. For example, Nikon’s proprietary software does a great
job with sharpness when processing .nef files, but it lacks some of Camera
Raw’s features. If sharpness is your overriding requirement, you might prefer
the Nikon software. (Remember that your Raw file can’t be processed by both
the camera’s software and then by Camera Raw, but you can process the data
with either, and then further refine your image in Photoshop itself.)
Do You Have What It Takes?
To capture images in the Raw format requires only a camera that shoots Raw.
To work with those images in Photoshop, you need both a camera and soft-
ware that can process the Raw files. To work with images in Photoshop CS2’s
Camera Raw plug-in, you need a camera on the supported cameras list for
Camera Raw — and, of course, Photoshop with Camera Raw. Adobe updates
the Camera Raw plug-in regularly to ensure compatibility with the latest cam-
eras as well as with the latest nit-picky changes that camera manufacturers
have made to their proprietary versions of Raw. (If we all get together and
chant, “Dee-En-Gee” loud and long, do you think those camera companies
might adopt the .dng file format?) Check for the latest Camera Raw update
and list of supported cameras here (and don’t forget to read the installation
instructions):
www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html
Working with images in the Raw format requires one other thing that you
might not have: additional time. Opening the Camera Raw plug-in, making the
necessary adjustments to your image, and then transferring the image into
Photoshop all take time. Granted, making changes in Camera Raw eliminates
the need for many of the adjustments that you’d be making in Photoshop, but
working in Camera Raw could seem to be slower. (Actually, depending on
your system, Camera Raw might speed things up because tonal adjustment,
color correction, sharpening, and noise reduction are all in one place —
there’s no waiting for adjustments and filters to be applied and then for the
next dialog box to open.)
Working in the Camera Raw Plug-In
The cornerstone of Photoshop’s Raw capability is the Camera Raw plug-in.
Although you can open an image from Adobe Bridge, the file management
program installed with Photoshop (see Chapter 4), directly into Photoshop,
doing so assumes that you want to use the adjustments already recorded in
the image’s metadata. After an image is open in Photoshop itself, you 
137
Chapter 7: Hur-RAW for the Home Team!

138
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
manipulate the pixels directly, rather than manipulating the metadata. When
you work in the Camera Raw plug-in, you never change the image itself, only
the adjustments recorded in the file’s metadata (or in a sidecar file).
As you can see in Figure 7-1, the Camera Raw window is filled with tools and
sliders. Even though you might not work with all the Camera Raw features,
here’s the lowdown on the features there.
Tools and preview options
In the upper-left corner of the Camera Raw window are
several new tools at your command (as shown in Figure
7-2). In addition to the standard Zoom, Hand, and White
Balance tools, Photoshop CS2 adds tools for cropping and
straightening your images right in Camera Raw, giving you
the capability of adding color samplers to track the adjust-
ments as you’re making them. You also find rotate buttons
with the tools, which work in 90-degree increments.
Drag the Crop tool to create a bounding box, which you
can then adjust by dragging its anchor points. Position the
tool just outside the bounding box and drag to rotate. The
image is cropped when you click the Open button. If you
drag the Straighten tool along a line in the image that
should be horizontal or vertical, a crop bounding box is
created with that alignment. If you don’t need to rotate the
image, use the Crop tool. If you do want to rotate your
image, use either. (You will find that the Straighten tool is
a great way to find the correct angle of rotation.)
When you add color samplers (a maximum of four) to the
image preview area (click with the Color Sampler tool),
their values are displayed below the tools. When you
haven’t added color samplers, that area is collapsed, leav-
ing more room for the preview area. Color Samplers in
Camera Raw function the same as they do in Photoshop
(see Chapter 6).
Color samplers are great for making sure that you don’t
blow out your highlights (make them pure white) or clog
your shadows (turn them pure black). Click with the Color
Sampler tool to add a color sampler to both a highlight
area and a shadow area, and then place your remaining
two color samplers in strategic areas. (I like to place a
Figure 7-2: You find
Camera Raw’s tools
in the upper-left
corner of the
window.

color sampler in an area of the image that should be neutral, preferably mid-
gray, and a color sampler in the most critical area of the image’s subject.)
Remember that you can drag a color sampler (with the Color Sampler tool) to
move it and drag it out of the preview area to delete it. You can delete all
color samplers with the Clear Samplers button.
To the right of the tools and rotate buttons are three preview check boxes.
Check/uncheck the Preview box to gauge your progress as you make changes
to the image’s adjustments. Mark the Shadows and the Highlights check
boxes to see gamut warnings, which are overlays that indicate when areas of
your image are being forced to pure black or white. Those areas lose all
detail, which you generally want to avoid. (I will readily admit that I often
intentionally clog shadows and blow out highlights to produce special effects
and to focus attention on the subject of my photos.)
The histogram
Because of the unprocessed nature of Raw images, the histogram you see in
the top-right corner of the Camera Raw window (also shown in Figure 7-3) is
generally far more important that the Histogram palette in Photoshop itself.
By keeping an eye on the histogram
while you adjust sliders, you can
ensure that you’re not blowing out
the highlights (when the very right
end of the histogram starts crawling
up the edge) or clogging the shad-
ows (the left edge gets too tall). (The
RGB values that you see just above
the histogram represent the values
of the pixel directly under the cursor
when the cursor is in the preview
area of the window.)
The histogram in Camera Raw shows you not only the distribution of tonal
values but also the distribution by channel. In Figure 7-3, you can see that the
Blue channel has a lot of dark pixels. (The blue column climbs the left edge of
the histogram.) This could indicate any of a number of situations. However,
because you also see a generally good distribution of blue throughout the
histogram, you can be pretty sure that the column of blue to the left simply
indicates a lot of yellow in the image. (Blue and yellow are color opposites in
RGB.) As always, remember that what you see in the preview area — what
your eyes tell you — trumps any information from a histogram.
The preview area
As you can see in Figure 7-1, the bulk of the Camera Raw window is filled with
the image preview, giving you the best possible view of your work. Remember
139
Chapter 7: Hur-RAW for the Home Team!
Figure 7-3: Use the histogram to make sure you
don’t wreck your highlights and shadows.

140
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
that you can drag the lower-right corner of the Camera Raw window to resize
it. The preview area benefits/suffers from the changes that you make as you
enlarge/shrink the window. To the lower left are a pop-up menu with preset
zoom factors as well as a pair of buttons to zoom in or out. (Don’t forget
about the Zoom tool!)
Workflow options
Below the preview area is a check
box that shows or hides the work-
flow options area (which is visible in
Figure 7-4). The choices that you
make in this part of the Camera Raw
dialog box determine the pixel
dimensions, color depth, resolution,
and even the color profile of the
image when opened in Photoshop.
After you make decisions and select options in the workflow area, you might
want to clear the check box to increase the preview area. (That’s generally
more important with portrait-oriented images than with landscape images —
when the image is taller than it is wide, you might want to maximize the pre-
view area.)
Here are your options:
 Space: Camera Raw offers only four color spaces — Adobe RGB,
ColorMatch RGB, ProPhoto RGB, and sRGB. Color spaces (read about
them in Chapter 6) determine which colors are available in an image.
Using the ProPhoto RGB color space gives you the widest gamut (the
largest number of possible colors), which minimizes the chance of
colors getting squished into each other as you work with your image. If
your image has extreme colors, use ProPhoto (and 16-bit color) in
Camera Raw, and then use Photoshop’s Edit➪Convert to Profile com-
mand to change your required profile (perhaps Adobe RGB or sRGB).
Select Relative Colorimetric as the rending intent.
 Size: You can choose from among six pixel dimensions for your image in
Camera Raw. The camera’s native pixel dimensions for the image is the
default, but you can also downsize to 50% or 67%, or upsize to 133%,
167%, or 200%. Camera Raw uses a variation of the Bicubic Sharper algo-
rithm for upsampling (increasing the number of pixels in the image), so if
you need to increase the image’s size, you’re generally better off opening
the image at its native size and using Photoshop’s Image Size command
with Resample set to Bicubic Smoother.
Figure 7-4: Make decisions about the
processed image in the Workflow Options
area.

 Depth: Because a greater color depth means more possible variations in
color, generally you want to select 16-bit color and either keep the image
in that color depth or switch to 8-bit color later in Photoshop (with the
Image➪Mode➪8-Bits/Channel command). Use 8-bit color for any image
that must be saved in JPEG format (including Web images), for CMYK
(cyan/magenta/yellow/black) images, or when the file size overwhelms
your printer. You might also opt for 8-bit color if storage space is limited.
(Chapter 6 includes a detailed explanation of color depth.)
 Resolution: Resolution is simply an instruction to a printing device
about what size to make each pixel. It can be assigned in Camera Raw or
later in Photoshop’s Image Size dialog box (with Resample unselected).
The Settings pop-up and menu
Click the Settings pop-up menu — the menu to the left in Figure 7-5 — to
select from among saved sets of adjustments and any recent image adjust-
ments. Most of the time, you’ll use
these as a starting point — as soon as
you make an adjustment to a slider,
the Settings pop-up switches to
Custom.
Use the menu shown to the right in
Figure 7-5 to save sets of settings in
Camera Raw for future use. If, for
example, you shot a series of images
under identical conditions with identi-
cal camera settings, you can adjust
one of the images and save those
adjustments for use with your other
images.
Note, too, that you can access the Camera Raw Preferences through the same
menu. In the Preferences tab, you can elect to save all the various image
adjustments with the individual images in sidecar files or in a single data-
base. (For most users, keeping the settings in a sidecar file is more practical.)
You can also choose to apply any sharpening to the image preview or to the
preview and the image itself. (Because you have more control over sharpen-
ing in Photoshop than you do in Camera Raw, I suggest that you don’t do any
sharpening in Camera Raw.) You can also increase the maximum size for the
Camera Raw cache, which could be important if you process a huge number
of images through the plug-in.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
The Adjust tab
Now this is the heart of Camera Raw! The Adjust
tab (as shown in Figure 7-6) is where you make
the most important adjustments to your image’s
appearance. Camera Raw generally does a very
good job of combining its built-in knowledge of
your specific camera model and its analysis of
the individual image to provide you with a good
starting point. You can then tweak the image
(keeping an eye on the histogram) to bring out
its best.
Generally, you adjust the white point (the
Temperature and the Tint sliders) by clicking
with the White Balance tool (which looks like
the Eyedropper tool, seen here in the margin) 
in some area that should be neutral and close 
to white. Next, adjust the Exposure slider to
spread the histogram across most of the space
available. Work with the Shadows and the
Brightness sliders to maximize the tonal range
(without sending the histogram crawling up the
left or right edges). The Contrast and the Saturation sliders, as you can
guess, manage the contrast in the midtones and the saturation of the colors
in your image.
As you work, the best adjustments are those that make the image look great
to you and meet your creative goals.
When working with the Exposure and the Shadows sliders, you can press the
Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) key to see any pixels in your image that are
being clipped (forced to the maximum value) in the shadows, highlights, or
any color. Hold the Option/Alt key and drag the sliders. White pixels show
where highlights are being clipped, black pixels show where shadows are
being clipped, and colors indicate clipping in one or two color channels.
Avoid clipping (except for special artistic effects) because your image loses
detail when similar colors are forced to a single extreme value.
The Detail tab
You have three sliders on the Detail tab to control sharpness and noise in
your image. I suggest that as soon as you click the Detail tab, you zoom in to
200% (or even 400%) on an area of shadow in your image and drag the three
sliders all the way to the left, setting them to 0 (zero). Leave the Sharpness
slider at 0; do your sharpening in Photoshop’s Smart Sharpen (or Unsharp
Mask) filter, where you have a Radius slider to control how the sharpening is
applied to the image.
Figure 7-6: You make changes to
tonality and color in the Adjust
tab.

Drag the Color Noise Reduction
slider slowly to the right until all
red/green/blue specks in the shad-
ows disappear. Next, drag the
Luminance Smoothing slider to the
right until the bright specks in your
shadows are reduced (but not so far
to the right that detail in your image
is damaged). Figure 7-7 shows a
“before” and “after” comparison.
The Lens tab
Use the Lens tab’s controls (as
shown in Figure 7-8) to compensate
for certain undesirable characteris-
tics of your lens. Zoom in on an area
of angled lines in an image — per-
haps tree branches in front of a
bright sky — and look for colorful
halos or fringes along edges. Use the
Chromatic Aberration sliders to mini-
mize the fringe. Be patient and care-
ful — often there will be one precise
pair of settings that eliminates the problem.
Use the Vignetting sliders to elimi-
nate darkness around the edges of
the image or, perhaps, to introduce
either darkness or lightness as a spe-
cial effect. When the Amount slider
has a value other than 0, the
Midpoint slider is active, which lets
you set the diameter of the vignette.
In Figure 7-9, the original image is
shown at the top. Below, you see
what happens when you drag the
Amount slider to the left for a dark
effect and to the right to lighten the
corners of the shot, smoothing the
appearance of the sky.
The Curve tab
When you open the Curve tab in Camera Raw (see Figure 7-10), you can
directly control the tonality of the image, just as you do in Photoshop’s
Curves dialog box. Keep in mind that this is in addition to changes that you
make in the Adjust tab. The histogram you see ghosted behind the curve in
Figure 7-10 represents the image’s current settings in the Adjust tab.

Figure 7-10: The Curve can be tweaked or jerked hard, depending on your artistic vision.
Manipulate the curve by dragging the existing six anchor points, or click and
drag to create custom anchor points. You can use the Curve tab to very
gently adjust the tonality of your image or to radically alter the image, creat-
ing very interesting color effects.
The Calibrate tab
The Calibrate tab truly fine-tunes your adjust-
ments. You might want to use it to adjust the
camera default setting to compensate for what
you perceive to be regular and consistent devia-
tion in your camera’s behavior. You might, under
some circumstances, want to use the sliders in
the Calibrate tab (see Figure 7-11) to reduce a
color cast, an unwanted color tint in the image.
(Use very small adjustments!) Generally, though,
you’ll skip the Calibrate tab completely.
Figure 7-11: The Calibrate sliders
might be useful for correcting a
color cast.

The Camera Raw buttons
In the lower-right corner of the dialog box are four buttons, three of which
have hidden features that you access by pressing the Option/Alt key (as
shown in Figure 7-12):
 Save.../Save: After making your adjust-
ments, click the Save... button to open the
DNG Converter dialog box and save a copy
of the image as a DNG file. Option-click/
Alt-click to bypass the DNG Options dialog
box and simply save the image as a DNG
file. When you close the Camera Raw
window, the image is saved automatically.
(For more on the DNG file format and the
DNG Options dialog box, see the sidebar,
“The DNG file format.”)
 Cancel/Reset: Clicking Cancel closes the
Camera Raw window without making any
changes to the image’s metadata. Holding down the Option/Alt key
changes the button to Reset, which restores the settings seen when you
first opened the image in Camera Raw.
 Open/Open Copy: After making your adjustments, click Open to update
the file’s metadata and open the image in Photoshop itself. Holding
down Option/Alt changes the button to Open Copy, which opens the
image without updating the metadata. You might use Open Copy when
creating a second version of the image while preserving your exactingly
precise original adjustments.
 Done: The Done button, with or without the Option/Alt key, simply
updates the image’s metadata with the adjustments you’ve made and
closes Camera Raw without opening the image.

T
here you are, repainting the bedroom — all by yourself, saving money,
being productive — and it’s time to do the windows. Now, you probably
don’t want to paint over the glass, right? Just the frame, the sash, the sill,
those little whatch-ya-call-its between the panes, right? There are several
ways you can avoid painting the glass. You can use a little brush and paint
very carefully. You can use a larger brush, paint faster, and scrape the excess
from the glass afterward. You can grab the masking tape, protect the glass,
and paint as sloppily as you like — when the tape comes off, the glass is
paint-free.
Those are unbelievably similar to the choices that you
have in Photoshop when you need to work on only a
part of your image. You can zoom in and use tools,
dragging the cursor over only those pixels that you
want to change (just like using a tiny paintbrush).
You can use the History Brush feature (which I intro-
duce in Chapter 1) to restore parts of the image to
the pre-change state (like scraping the glass). You
can isolate the area of the image you want to change
with a selection (much like protecting the rest of the
image with tape).
In this chapter, you read about getting ready to make
changes to your image rather than actually making those
changes. You can isolate groups of pixels in your image in a vari-
ety of ways. For example, you can select pixels that are in the same part
of the image (regardless of color), or you can select pixels that are the same
color (regardless of location in the image). This is power: the capability to tell
Photoshop exactly which pixels you want to alter. After you make that selec-
tion, you can manipulate the pixels in a variety of ways — everything from

148
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
making color and tonal adjustments to working with Photoshop’s creative fil-
ters to simply copying them so you can paste them into another image.
I discuss “taping the glass” first by making selections and then by using
masks — channels that actually store selection information. After that, read
about working with adjustment layers, which are special layers that help you
apply certain color and tonal adjustments without actually changing any
pixels in the image. An adjustment layer even lets you restrict the change to
one or several layers in the image.
What Is a Selection?
When you make a selection in your image, you’re simply isolating some of the
pixels, picking them (selecting them) so that you can do something to those
pixels without doing it to all the pixels in your image. Photoshop shows you
what part of the image is within the selection with a flashing dashed line.
(Now that you’re part of the Photoshop Inner Circle, you call that selection
boundary the marching ants.)
Say, for example, that part of your image looks great, but part of the image
looks, well, just plain wrong. Figure 8-1 is an excellent example.
Figure 8-1: Sometimes only part of the image needs changes.

By making a selection and applying an adjustment, I can make this image look
much, much better. Of course, you might choose to make a different selection and
apply a different adjustment, but you can see what I chose to do in the lower-left of
Figure 8-2. By selecting the rails (in this case, with the Polygon Lasso tool, which I
explain later in this chapter), I isolate those areas from the rest of the image,
enabling me to change the color of those pixels without changing anything else.
Figure 8-2: The selection (shown to the right) restricts the change to some parts of the image.
The tonal and color adjustments that I discuss in Chapters 5 and 6 are often
applied to an image as a whole. You can, however, apply them to specific
areas of an image. Much of the rest of the work that you do in Photoshop is
not global in nature, but rather is done to only restricted areas of your image.
You use selections to do that restricting.
You can also use selections for a variety of other jobs in Photoshop. One of
the most common is copying from one image and pasting into another. You
can see one example in Figure 8-3. The subject of one image (upper-left) is
selected. (You can see a close-up of the selection to the right.) The menu com-
mand Edit➪Copy copies the selected pixels to the computer’s memory (the
Clipboard). You can then switch to another image and use the Edit➪Paste
command to drop those pixels into a second image (lower-left). Adjust the
lighting, size, and position. Perhaps add some shadows with the Brush tool.
The job is ready for whatever nefarious purpose you might have in mind!

Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Figure 8-3: Make a selection, copy, switch to another image, and paste.
Any pixel in your image can be selected, unselected, or partially selected. For
example, if you have a selection and fill it with red, the selected pixels turn
red, the unselected pixels don’t change, and the partially selected pixels get a
red tint. How much tint depends on the level of selection. (Photoshop gener-
ally uses 8-bit grayscale for selections, so there are 256 different levels of
“selected.”)
Feathering and Anti-aliasing
You need to keep in mind a couple of very important terms as you read about
the various tools and commands with which you make selections. Both feath-
ering and anti-aliasing make the edges of your selections softer by using par-
tially transparent or differently colored pixels. That, in turn, helps blend
whatever you’re doing to that selection into the rest of the image.

Don’t forget that all pixels in your image are square, aligned in neat, orderly
rows and columns. (That’s the raster in raster artwork.) When you create a
curve or diagonal in your artwork, the corners of the pixels stick out.
Feathering and anti-aliasing disguise that ragged edge. You can also use feath-
ering to create larger, softer selections with a faded edge. Generally speaking,
use anti-aliasing to keep edges looking neat and use feathering to create a
soft, faded selection.
Nothing illustrates the power of feathering quite like a simple black-on-white
demonstration, as you see in Figure 8-4. In the upper-left, I made an unfeath-
ered selection and filled it with black. To the upper-right, the filled selection
is exactly the same size but has a 2-pixel feather. Below, I used a 15-pixel
feather when making the selection.
Figure 8-4: A close-up look at no feathering, feathering, and lots of feathering.
151
Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes

152
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Note that there’s feathering on both sides of the selection border. And don’t
be fooled by the amount that you enter in the Feather field on the Options
bar — that’s a general guideline, not a precise value. A 15-pixel feather for the
Elliptical Marquee tool might give you 50 or 60 partially transparent pixels,
half on either side of the selection border. Even a 1-pixel feather gives you a
selection with several “soft” pixels on either side.
Anti-aliasing is similar to feathering
in that it softens edges: It’s designed
to hide the corners of pixels along
curves and in diagonal lines. You use
anti-aliasing with type (as I explain
in Chapter 13). You’ll often find that
anti-aliasing is all you need to keep
the edges of your selections pretty;
feathering isn’t required. Anti-
aliasing is a yes/no option, with no
numeric field to worry about. Figure
8-5 compares a diagonal with no anti-
aliasing, with anti-aliasing, and with
a 1-pixel feather.
At 100 percent zoom (to the upper
left), the first line looks bumpy along
the edges (has a case of the jaggies). The lower line looks soft and mushy, out
of focus. And the middle line? To quote Goldilocks, “It’s just right!” When
zoomed to 600%, you can really see those jaggies and that softening. And in
the middle, you see that the anti-aliasing uses light gray and mid-gray pixels
interspersed along the edge among the black pixels. At 100% zoom (upper-
left), your eye is fooled into seeing a straight black edge.
Generally speaking, use anti-aliasing with just about every selection (other
than rectangular or square), and use feathering when you want to really
soften the edges to create a special effect.
Making Your Selections with Tools
Photoshop offers you eight tools whose whole purpose in life is to help you
make selections. You also use those tools to alter your selections by adding
to, subtracting from, and intersecting with an existing selection. The eight
selection tools are divided into three groups:
 Four marquee tools
 Three lasso tools
 A single tool: the Magic Wand
Figure 8-5: Anti-aliasing helps smooth the
appearance of curves and diagonals.

Marquee selection tools
You have four marquee selection tools although you’ll generally use only two
of them. Figure 8-6 shows the marquee selection tools, along with each tool’s
Options bar configuration.
Figure 8-6: Marquee selection tools come in four flavors, two of which are tasty.
You drag the very-useful Rectangular Marquee and Elliptical Marquee tools to
make selections. Click and drag in any direction to make your selection. After
you start dragging, hold down the Shift key (while still dragging) to constrain
proportions. When you constrain the proportions of a selection, you create a
square or circle rather than a rectangle or an ellipse. If you start dragging a
selection and press the Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) key, the selection cen-
ters itself on the point where you click. The Shift and Option/Alt keys can be
used together. Holding down the Shift key before you click and drag adds the
selection to any existing selection. Holding down the Option/Alt key before
dragging subtracts the new selection from any existing selection.
The Single Row Marquee and Single Column Marquee tools are simply clicked
at the point where you want a 1-pixel selection, running from side-to-side or
from top-to-bottom. These tools create selections that extend the full width
or full height of your image. You might use these tools to create a grid-like
selection that you can fill with color. Or you might never use them at all.
Take another glance at the Options bars in Figure 8-6. The four buttons to the
left in the Options bar, which you can use with any of the tools, determine
how the tool interacts with an existing selection.
153
Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes

154
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
 New Selection: When you select the first button, any selection that you
make replaces an active selection (deselecting any previous selection).
If, with a selection tool, you click inside an active selection when the
first option is active, you can drag that selection in your image without
moving any pixels. (When you haven’t already made a selection, these
tools always make a new selection, regardless of which button is active.)
 Add To: When you have an active selection and need to add to that
selection, use the second button (or simply press and hold down the
Shift key while dragging).
 Subtract From: When you have a selection and need to deselect part of
it, use the third button. Say, for example, that you make a round selec-
tion and want to chop out the middle to make a donut shape. Click the
third button, and then drag within the original selection to deselect the
donut hole.
 Intersect With: You have a selection, but you want to keep only part of
the selection. You could set your selection tool to subtract from the
existing selection, or you could intersect with that original selection and
deselect a number of areas at once.
Figure 8-7 presents a visual explanation of how all four buttons work. On the
left, you see the selected option for the active marquee selection tool. Next is
an original selection. In the third column, you see another selection being
made (with the selection tool dragged from the lower-right to the upper-left).
Finally, on the right, you see the result of combining the two selections.
In the bottom-most example, you could do a whole series of subtractions
from the existing selection to chop off the “points,” but using the intersect
option takes care of the job with a single drag.
While you’re dragging a selection with the Rectangular Marquee or the
Elliptical Marquee tool, you can hold the mouse button down and press and
hold the spacebar to reposition the marquee. When you’ve got it where you
want it, release the spacebar and continue to drag.
Lasso selection tools
You have three lasso selection tools available in Photoshop CS2. On the
Options bar, all three of the lasso selection tools offer you the same basic fea-
tures that you find in the marquee selection tools, as you can see in Figure
8-8. You can add to, subtract from, or intersect with an existing selection. You
also have the feathering and anti-aliasing options available.

Figure 8-7: The buttons at the left on the Options bar control selection interaction.
Figure 8-8: The basic options for the lasso selection tools match those for the marquee
selection tools.
155
Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes

156
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
So what makes lasso tools different from a marquee tool? Read on to find out:
 Lasso tool: The Lasso tool is a true freeform tool; that is, you click and
drag it wherever you want the selection to go. You can drag around and
return to the starting point or you can release the mouse button any-
where, and your selection is finished along a straight line from that point
to the spot where you start your selection. If you press and hold the
Option/Alt key while dragging, you’ll temporarily switch to the Polygon
Lasso tool.
 Polygon Lasso tool: Rather than dragging, you click-click-click to make
straight selection segments, at any angle, for any distance. When you
position the cursor directly over your starting point, a little circle
appears to the lower-right of the cursor to indicate that you’re back to
the start. Or simply double-click to finish the selection. If you press and
hold the Option/Alt key while dragging, you’ll temporarily switch to the
regular Lasso tool, which lets you drag your selection any way you want.
Using the Option/Alt key lets you switch back and forth between the
freeform drag of the Lasso tool and the perfectly straight selection bor-
ders of the Polygon Lasso tool.
 Magnetic Lasso tool: When you need to select around a subject that has
good contrast with its background, the Magnetic Lasso tool can do a
great job. The perfect candidate for this tool is a simple object on a very
plain background. You can, however, use it with just about any image
where the edges of the area you want to select differ substantially from
the rest of the image. Click and drag the tool along the edge of your 
Controlled selections
Lurking within the Options bar Style drop-down
menu are two options worth noting: Fixed
Aspect Ratio and Fixed Size. Using the Fixed
Aspect Ratio option with the Rectangular
Marquee or the Elliptical Marquee tool forces
the selection to the height and width relation-
ship that you specify in the Options bar. This is
great for composing an image that you need at
a specific size, say to fit in a standard picture
frame. The selection tool won’t resize the image
for you, but you can make the selection and use
the Image➪Crop command, and then use the
Image➪Image Size command to resize to your
required dimensions and resolution. (Read
about resizing and cropping your images in
Chapter 4.)
The Fixed Size option changes the behavior of
the tools. After you enter an exact width and
height in the Options bar, position the cursor in
the upper-left corner of the area that you want
to select and click once — the selection is cre-
ated to the lower right of that point. Don’t worry
about being exact because you can drag the
selection marquee into position afterward.
(You’ll want to have the left-most of the four but-
tons on the Options bar selected to reposition
your selection.) And take a look at the button
between the Width and Height fields on the
Options bar: When you’re using the Fixed
Aspect Ratio or Fixed Size styles, click that
button to swap the values in the two fields.

subject. If the tool misses the edge, back up and drag along the edge
again. If the edge makes a sudden change in direction, click the mouse
button to add an anchor point. If the tool places an anchor point in the
wrong spot, back up and then press Delete/Backspace to remove the
point. (By the way, if you have a Wacom pressure -sensitive tablet hooked
up, you can set the Magnetic Lasso tool to vary its width according to
pen pressure. Use the button just to the left of the Palette Well on the
Options bar.)
The Magnetic Lasso tool works by identifying the difference in color along
the edges, using all available color channels. From the Options bar, use the
Width field to tell the tool how wide of an area it can look in to find an edge.
The Edge Contrast field tells the tool how much the edge must differ while
searching. Use the Frequency field to choose the number of anchor points
the tool sets while outlining the selection.
The Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool selects pixels similar in color to the pixel on which you
click with the tool. Like the other selection commands, you can add to, sub-
tract from, or intersect with an existing selection, and you can select anti-
aliasing. In Figure 8-9, you can see three additional options, unique among the
selection tools. Tolerance determines how closely pixels must match your
target color to be included in the selection. When you enable the Contiguous
check box, only pixels connected to the spot that you click by pixels of the
same color are selected. The Sample All Layers option lets you make a selec-
tion of similarly colored pixels on every visible layer in your image, not just
the currently active layer.
In Figure 8-9, you can see the result of clicking the same spot, using four dif-
ferent Tolerance settings. In the upper left, the Magic Wand was set to
Tolerance: 10; in the upper right, Tolerance: 20; in the lower left, Tolerance:
50; and in the lower right, Tolerance: 100. You can see that the higher the tol-
erance, the wider range of color selected. When you use a low Tolerance set-
ting, you select only those pixels in the image that are very similar to the
pixel on which you click. A high Tolerance setting gives you a much wider
range of color, which might or might not be appropriate for the selection
you’re making.
Use a reasonably low Tolerance setting and Shift-click with the Magic Wand in
different places to select a range of colors. In the photo in Figure 8-9, I would
use a low Tolerance setting when Shift-clicking the highlights in the blooms
to avoid selecting the highlights on the leaves and the fence.

Figure 8-9: The lower the Tolerance, the fewer pixels in the selection.
Your Selection Commands
You have over a dozen menu commands at your service when selecting pixels
in your artwork. Some, like those near the top of the Select menu, are rather
simple and aptly named. See Figure 8-10 for a list of the Select commands.
The primary selection commands
The commands near the top of the Select menu are
features that you’re likely to use regularly. (Okay,
maybe not the Reselect command.) Memorizing
their keyboard shortcuts is a timesaver.
 Select All (Ô+A/Ctrl+A): Select All does
exactly what the name implies — it makes a
selection of all the pixels in your image on
the active layer (or in an active layer mask).
 Deselect (Ô+D/Ctrl+D): Use the Deselect
command to make sure that no pixels are
selected. This is a handy command when it
seems that a filter or adjustment command
isn’t working. There could be an unnoticed
selection in the image, preventing the com-
mand from appearing how you expect.
Figure 8-10: Photoshop’s
selection commands.

 Reselect (Ô+Shift+D/Ctrl+Shift+D): This is a great little command for
those times when you’re making a complex selection, and a little slip
accidentally deselects. Just use Reselect to restore the most recent
selection.
 Inverse (Ô+Shift+I/Ctrl+Shift+I): The Inverse command reverses the
selection. What was selected is deselected, and what wasn’t selected
becomes selected. (Don’t forget to use the Shift key — without it, you
invert the colors in your image rather than your selection!)
The second section of the Select menu contains three commands (All Layers,
Deselect Layers, and Similar Layers) used not for pixels but rather with the
layers in your image. Use these commands with multilayer images. (Read
about using layers in your artwork in Chapter 10.)
The Color Range command
In its own little group, right in the middle of the Select menu, is the incredibly
powerful Color Range command. Check out those orange blooms from Figure
8-9. Rather than Shift-clicking with the Magic Wand, you can select the orange
quickly and easily with the Color Range command. In Figure 8-11, I clicked
and dragged through some orange areas in the image with the middle
Eyedropper tool. (You can also click once with the left eyedropper and use
the other eyedroppers to add and subtract colors from the selection.) The
Fuzziness slider near the top determines how close a color must be to those
through which you dragged to be included in the selection.
Figure 8-11: The Color Range feature selects by color.
159
Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes

160
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Here are a couple of ways that you can get a better look at your selection as
you create it. In Figure 8-12, you see the options (available from the Selection
Preview menu). The Grayscale (upper left) and Black Matte (upper right) do a
good job of showing that the background will be partially selected if you click
OK. (Lower the Fuzziness or use the right-hand eyedropper to click in those
areas of the fence that shouldn’t be selected.) The White Matte (lower left)
does an excellent job of showing that the tips of some leaves below the blooms
will also be selected. (Ignore that and Option+drag/Alt+drag with the Lasso tool
later to deselect that area.) Because of the color of this image’s subject, the red
Quick Mask preview (lower right) is almost worthless for this image (although
it is often good with other images that don’t have red and orange).
Figure 8-12: Color Range offers four ways to preview.
The pop-up menu at the top of the Color Range dialog box lets you pick
among the RGB (red/green/blue) and CMY (cyan/magenta/yellow) colors, as
well as the image’s highlights, midtones, or shadows, and even any out-of-
gamut colors in the image (colors that can’t be reproduced within the
selected color space). When you choose one of the presets from the top
menu, the Fuzziness slider isn’t available, limiting that feature’s value.
Selection modification commands
The next group of commands in the Select menu actually holds five separate
commands (Feather and the four Modify commands), each with a one-field
dialog box. Sneak a peek at Figure 8-13.

Figure 8-13: Each command presents you with a single option.
 Feather: Feathering, which I discuss earlier in this chapter, softens the
edges of a selection. Normally when cutting and pasting a selection or
moving a selection within an image, you want to feather a pixel or two.
Feather can be used with any selection except when you use the Select
All command.
 Border: Tucked away within the Modify submenu, the Border command
creates a selection of your chosen width centered on the marching ants
that you see as the original selection’s edges. In Figure 8-13, you see the
original selection (left), the 4-pixel border (center), and that border filled
with black (right). Border is available with all selections (including
Select All), but when the entire canvas is selected, you see only the
border on the inside of the original selection.
 Smooth: It could happen that when you click with the Magic Wand to
make a selection, you see all kinds of tiny 1- or 2-pixel areas within the
selection that are not selected. Perhaps those few pixels were just a bit
out of the Tolerance range for the tool. No worry! Use the Smooth com-
mand and a 1- or 2-pixel radius to snatch up those stray unselected
pixels. Smooth can also eliminate jagged edges along the outside of your
selection.
161
Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes

162
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
 Expand: The Expand command moves the selection border outward a
specified number of pixels. Be careful, though, if your original selection
includes sharp corners or points because using Expand rounds them off.
(In the Paths palette, convert your selection to a path, scale the path,
convert the path back to a selection. See Chapter 11 for info on paths.)
 Contract: The Contract command shrinks your selection by the amount
specified.
If you make your way down the Select menu, you’ll come across the Grow and
the Similar commands, which are somewhat like the Magic Wand with
Contiguous (Grow) and without Contiguous (Similar) selected on the Options
bar. (In fact, they use the Magic Wand’s Tolerance setting.) Grow adds to your
selection any adjacent pixels of the appropriate color, and Similar looks
throughout the entire image for similarly colored pixels. Use Grow and
Similar when your initial selection consists primarily of a single color. Using
these commands with a selection that contains lots of different colors gener-
ally results in most of your image being selected.
Transforming the shape of selections
As you work with selections, you might find times when the selection capabil-
ity doesn’t match your need. For example, the Elliptical Marquee tool can cer-
tainly make oval selections, but
those ovals are either vertical or 
horizontal. What if you need an oval
selection at an angle, such as what
you see in Figure 8-14? That’s where
the Select➪Transform command
comes into play. Make your initial
selection, choose the Transform
Selection command, and then 
manipulate the selection to fit 
your needs.
In Figure 8-14, you see that the selection is not just rotated but is also skewed
and distorted slightly. You can manipulate a selection any way you please
with Transform Selection. (Okay, well, you are limited to two dimensions —
you can’t make the selection come forward out of the monitor onto your
desk.) Consider Figure 8-15 to be your roadmap to transformations.
Figure 8-14: With Transform Selection, you can
manipulate the selection itself.

Figure 8-15: The many faces of transformations.
Here’s what you see in Figure 8-15:
 Top left: This is the original selection.
 Top center: Click an anchor point on any side of the bounding box and
drag to change the height or width of the selection.
 Top right: Position the cursor outside the bounding box and drag to
rotate.
 Middle left: Drag any corner anchor point to manipulate the selection’s
width and height at the same time.

 Middle center: Hold down the Shift key while dragging a corner anchor
point to avoid distorting the selection while changing size.
 Middle right: Hold down the Option/Alt key while dragging a corner
anchor point, and you end up scaling the image based on that crosshair
in the center of the bounding box. (You can drag that crosshair any-
where, even outside the bounding box, to change the point of transfor-
mation.) You can use the Shift key with Option/Alt, too.
 Bottom left: Hold down the Ô/Ctrl key and drag any side anchor point to
skew.

point to distort.

can add perspective to the selection. I might, for example, fill this trans-
formed selection with color, move the selection, scale it down a bit, fill
again, and repeat a number of times to create a series of paw prints
marching into the distance.
The mask-related selection commands
At the bottom of the Select menu, you see a pair of commands that you use to
store your selections for future use and to actually reuse them. When you
save a selection, you create an alpha channel in the image. The alpha chan-
nel, like a color channel, is a grayscale representation of the image. White
areas in the alpha channel represent areas that are selected when the chan-
nel is loaded as a selection. Black areas in the channel show you unselected
areas. Gray represents feathering and other partially selected pixels.
I discuss channels in greater depth in the next section of this chapter. While
discussing selection commands, the key points to remember are that you can
use the Save Selection command to save any selection as an alpha channel,
and then later use the Load Selection command to reactivate the selection
without having to re-create it from scratch.
Masks: Not Just for Halloween Anymore
In Photoshop, a mask is a channel (in the Channels palette) that stores infor-
mation about a selection or about layer visibility. (When you talk about selec-
tions saved as masks, you can refer to them as alpha channels.) Any time you
make a complex selection, consider saving it as an alpha channel, just in
case. So what exactly counts as complex? That depends on how much time
you have on your hands. If it takes me more than a minute or two to do any-
thing in Photoshop, I want to save it. And what counts as just in case? You
might need to return to the image at some later date to make changes, you
might need to shut down for the day, or maybe you’ll even (fingers crossed
against!) have a crash. Save your selections, just in case. . . .

Saving and loading selections
Creating an alpha channel from a selection is as simple as using the
Select➪Save Selection command and choosing a name for the new channel. If
you have more than one document of exactly the same pixel dimensions open
in Photoshop, you can select any of the available documents for the new
channel. If you already saved a selection as an alpha channel, you can elect
to have the two selections interact in a single channel. As you see in Figure
8-16, the Operation choices parallel those that you find on the Options bar
when working with selection tools: You can replace the selected channel, add
to the existing channel, subtract from the existing channel, or intersect with
that existing channel.
Figure 8-16: When you already have an alpha channel, the new selection can modify it.
When you need to work with a saved selection, choose Select➪Load
Selection or simply Ô-click/Ctrl-click the alpha channel’s thumbnail in the
Channels palette — either activates the selection.
The Load Selection dialog box offers the same key features that you see for
Save Selection. (Refer to Figure 8-16.) When loading a selection, you can add
to, subtract from, or intersect with an active selection. You can also invert a
selection when loading by selecting the Invert check box. Using that check
box produces the same result as loading the selection and choosing
Select➪Inverse, but it’s faster and easier.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Editing an alpha channel
Alpha channels, like color channels, are grayscale representations. As such,
you can edit them like you would any grayscale image. Click the channel in
the Channels palette to make it active and visible. You see it in the image
window as a grayscale (or black and white) representation of the saved selec-
tion. If you want to see the image while you work on the channel, click in the
left column (the eyeball column) to the left of the RGB (or CMYK) channel.
The alpha channel then appears as a red overlay on top of the image. Figure
8-17 shows you what the screen looks like with just the alpha channel visible
(left) and how it appears when the alpha channel is active and the RGB chan-
nel is also visible. (And take a look at the difference in the Channels palette.
See the eyeball column on the left?)
Figure 8-17: You can see just the alpha channel itself (left) or as a red overlay (right).
Here are some of the things that you might want to do to an active alpha
channel:
 Blur the alpha channel. Blurring an alpha channel (Filter➪Blur com-
mands) is much like feathering a selection — it softens the edges. One of
the big differences is that you can see a preview of the blur, which is
much better than guessing how much feathering you need.
 Sharpen the alpha channel. Sharpening a saved selection
(Filter➪Sharpen commands) makes the edges cleaner and more precise.

 Paint in the alpha channel. Painting with the Brush tool using black,
white, and gray in the channel changes the selection. Paint with white to
add areas to the saved selection; paint with black to remove areas from
the selection; paint with shades of gray to partially select areas of the
image. You can edit an alpha channel with the Brush tool very precisely,
adding and eliminating stray pixels, as well as creating precise edges.
See Figure 8-18, upper left, for an example of a channel that needs some
touch-up that’s best done by hand.
Figure 8-18: You have lots of ways — and reasons — to edit alpha channels.
 Use levels or curves on the alpha channel. If the saved selection has
feathering or other areas of partial selection (grays in the alpha chan-
nel), you can manipulate them with a Levels or Curves adjustment (from
the Image➪Adjustments menu). The Levels adjustment is particularly
appropriate for controlling the feathering along an edge (as you can see
in the upper right in Figure 8-18).
 Apply one or more filters to an alpha channel. Use artistic filters on a
saved selection to create special effects, such as borders and frames.
Take a look at the bottom of Figure 8-18. On the left is the original; to its
right, you see a couple of samples. (This is one of those great places
where you can let your imagination run free across the open plains of
Photoshop!) Chapter 15 covers filters.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Working in Quick Mask mode
Okay, so you want to make a selection, save it as an alpha channel, make the
alpha channel active, click the eyeball column to make the RGB channel visi-
ble so you can see what you’re doing, paint in and apply filters to the alpha
channel, make the RGB channel active, load the alpha channel as a selection,
and, well, do something creative with it. Whew! How about an easier way to
do the same thing?
With Photoshop’s Quick Mask mode, you make a basic selection, press Q on
the keyboard to enter Quick Mask mode, edit the selection as if it were a
mask, and then press Q again. Heck, you don’t even have to start with a selec-
tion! In Quick Mask mode, your mask appears onscreen as a red overlay, just
like an alpha channel appears when the RGB channel is visible (as you can
see in Figure 8-17). Paint, apply filters or adjustments, or make selections —
anything you can do to a grayscale image, you can do in Quick Mask mode.
If you’re more comfortable with the Brush tool
than the Lasso tool, you might want to use Quick
Mask mode to make all your selections. You may
find it faster and easier to “paint” a selection in
Quick Mask mode than to drag a selection with a
lasso tool or use the selection commands. Enter
Quick Mask mode, paint the mask, exit Quick
Mask mode, and you have your selection. You
can also enter and exit Quick Mask mode by click-
ing the buttons just below the color swatches in
the Toolbox. Double-clicking either of those but-
tons opens the Quick Mask Options dialog box
(as shown in Figure 8-19). You can reverse the behavior of the overlay,
making it show selected areas instead of the unselected areas, and you can
change the color and opacity of the overlay. (Hop back to Figure 8-12 to see
how hard it is to see the edges of the orange blooms with the red overlay.
Changing the overlay to, say, blue would solve that problem.)
By default, you paint with black in Quick Mask mode over areas that you
don’t want selected, paint with white over areas that you do want selected,
and paint with shades of gray over areas that you want partially selected.
Adding masks to layers
When your image has multiple layers (as I discuss in Chapter 10), you can
partially hide layers with layer masks. Layer masks and alpha channels have
much in common: Layer masks are selections saved as channels, you can
paint in the layer mask, you can apply filters and adjustment to the layer
Figure 8-19: You can change
the opacity and color of the
Quick Mask overlay.

mask, and so on. Just keep in mind that a layer mask appears in the Channels
palette only when you select its layer in the Layers palette. (In the Layers
palette, you’ll see the layer mask thumbnail to the right of the layer’s thumb-
nail.) To edit a layer mask, click its thumbnail in the Layers palette, and then
edit it as you would an alpha channel. (Remember to click the layer thumb-
nail afterward to reactivate the layer itself.)
The easiest way to add a layer mask is to make a selection of the pixels that
you want visible on that layer and then click the Add Layer Mask button at
the bottom of the Layers palette (third button from the left). You can also
make a selection and choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Reveal Selection or
Layer➪Add Layer Mask➪Hide Selection. That menu also offers Reveal All and
Hide All as well as commands to disable (hide) or delete the layer mask. You
can also apply the layer mask, which deletes any hidden pixels on that layer.
A layer named Background (in italics) in the Layers palette can’t have any
transparent areas, so you can’t add a layer mask. Not a problem! Simply
double-click the layer name in the Layers palette and rename the layer. That
converts it to a regular layer, which would be more than happy to accept
your layer mask.
In the Layers palette, a layer mask is linked to the layer — that is, if you drag
the layer, the mask moves right along with it. You can unlink/relink the mask
and layer by clicking the icon/space between their thumbnails in the Layers
palette.
Masking layers with vector paths
A layer can also be masked with a vector path. (Paths are explained in
Chapter 11.) Vector masks have very precise edges, and you can edit them as
a path with the Direct Selection tool. A layer (other than a Background layer)
can have both a regular pixel-based layer mask and a vector mask. To show
up in your artwork, pixels on that layer must be within both the layer mask
and the vector mask. When a layer has both a layer mask and a vector mask,
the vector mask thumbnail appears to the right in the Layers palette.
Adjustment Layers: Controlling Changes
Photoshop’s many commands for controlling the tonality and color of your
image are presented in Chapters 5 and 6. Many of those commands are also
available as adjustment layers. An adjustment layer applies the adjustment
just as the comparable command would, but using an adjustment layer offers
a few major advantages:
169
Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes

170
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
 Adjustable adjustments: You can reopen an adjustment layer’s dialog
box at any time to change the settings.
 Reversible adjustments: You can delete an adjustment layer, removing
the change from your image.
 Hidden adjustments: Click the eyeball column to the left of the adjust-
ment layer in the Layers palette to temporarily hide that change.
 Tweakable adjustments: You can change the opacity and blending mode
of adjustment layers to fine-tune the effect.
 Limitable adjustments: You can add layer masks and vector masks to
your adjustment layers to restrict their effect to only some of the pixels
below. And you can later edit the masks as necessary.
Because of the added flexibility, you’ll generally want to use adjustment
layers rather than adjustment commands in your images. Of course, you still
need the Image➪Adjustments menu for those several commands that can’t
be added through an adjustment layer.
Adding an adjustment layer
You can add an adjustment layer through the menu at the bottom of the
Layers palette (click the fourth button from the left, and then move the
cursor to the type of adjustment layer that you want to add) or through the
Layer➪New Adjustment Layer submenu. The choices are the same. When
you select the particular adjustment that you want to add from the bottom of
the Layers palette, that specific adjustment dialog box opens. Selecting the
adjustment through the Layers menu presents you with the New Layer dialog
box first. You can see all these various bits and pieces in Figure 8-20.
The top three options in the menu that you open from the Layers palette are
fill layers — layers completely filled with a color, gradient, or pattern. You
could add a new empty layer and use the Edit➪Fill command to do the same
thing, or add such a layer through the Layer➪New Fill Layer menu.

Figure 8-20: Adding adjustment layers from above and below.
Limiting your adjustments
Take another look at the New Layer dialog box in Figure 8-20. Note the handy
little Use Previous Layer to Create Clipping Mask check box. When you mark
that check box to select the option, your new adjustment layer is clipped —
restricted to the one layer immediately below it in the Layers palette. (That’s
the layer that is active when you add the adjustment layer.) Press and hold
the Option/Alt key before selecting an adjustment from the bottom of the
Layers palette to see this dialog box. And, not to worry — after adding an
adjustment layer, you can clip it to the layer below by Option-clicking/Alt-
clicking the line between the two layers in the Layers palette (which is also
how you unclip a pair of layers). Figure 8-21 shows the difference between a
clipped adjustment layer (left) and an unclipped adjustment layer (right).
When unclipped, the adjustment is applied to all the layers below rather than
to the one layer immediately below.
171
Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes

172
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Figure 8-21: Restrict an adjustment to one layer by clipping it to the layer.
On the left side of Figure 8-21, the Hue/Saturation adjustment is applied only
to the upper layer — the layer named Symbol. On the right, the adjustment
layer isn’t clipped, and so it changes both the Symbol layer and the Back-
ground layer. By the way, the thumbnail in the Layers palette shows the
Symbol layer’s original copper color prior to the addition of the Hue/
Saturation adjustment layer. Among the beauties of using adjustment layers
is the joy you might feel when the client says, “Yup, you were right — let’s go
back to the original design.”
In the Layers palette on the left in Figure 8-21, you can see the wedding rings
icon between the adjustment layer and the layer Symbol immediately below.
That’s the icon that you see when Option-clicking/Alt-clicking to clip (or
unclip) layers.
But what if you want an adjustment layer to change, say, three of the layers in
your image? Create a layer group from the layers (click the New Group button
at the bottom of the Layers palette, and drag the layers into the Group icon in
the palette), add the adjustment layer within the group, and change the layer
group’s blending mode from Pass Through to Normal at the top of the Layers
palette. The adjustment layer, within the layer group and at the top of the
layer group, is applied to all your layers in the group and only the layers in
that group.
Because they’re layers, you can use a layer mask to apply the adjustment
layer to only part of your layer. You’ll find it easier to make a selection of the
area where you want the adjustment before selecting the adjustment layer —
the mask will be automatically created from the selection.

Common Problems 
and Their Cures
In This Chapter
 Perfecting portraits of people
 Hushing the noise in your images
 Editing your digital landscape
S
ometimes you take perfect photos of imperfect people, and sometimes
you take imperfect photos of, well, imperfect people. (Even the top
models benefit from a little Photoshopping.) Although capturing absolute
reality is the goal of some artists and most photojournalists, the people in
your photos probably prefer to look as good as you (and Photoshop)
can make them look.
In this chapter, I present you with some basic techniques
for curing many of the most common problems that you
encounter as a photographer. I show you how to
remove that spooky red-eye effect that appears when
your camera’s flash reflects off the blood vessels in
the back of a subject’s eyes. I also show you tricks
for removing wrinkles, whitening teeth, and tighten-
ing waistlines. Digital noise (those distracting red,
green and blue pixels scattered in your image’s shad-
ows) is easy to minimize when you use the tricks
here. At the end of the chapter, I cover how to remove
some larger problems from images, such as distracting
objects and ex-boyfriends. Throughout this chapter, I use
real-world examples — the types of photos with which you’re
most likely to work. (After all, most of us don’t get to shoot beauti-
ful models all the time.)

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Making People Prettier
You can do lots of things in Photoshop to improve your images, but few are
appreciated as much as fixing a person’s photographed flaws (the appear-
ance kind, not their bad habits). Whether it’s a studio portrait or a snapshot,
the people in your images generally can benefit from a little touching up.
Although you can theoretically make almost anyone look truly beautiful and
glamorous using Photoshop, remember to balance improving with reality.
Always work on a copy of your image. I also recommend saving separate
copies at different stages during the editing process. The client might say
that he wants the braces removed from his teeth, but after you present the
finished product, he might just (gasp!) change his mind.
Getting the red out . . . digitally
When a subject looks directly into
the camera and the camera-mounted
flash fires, the result is often red-eye.
This is caused when light (such as a
flash) bounces off the blood vessels
at the back of an eye and gives the
subject a spooky vampire look.
Among the many ways to minimize
this problem is with the Photoshop
CS2 new Red Eye tool. Zoom in and
click once with the tool to watch the
red disappear, leaving the natural
highlights and a perfect eye. As you
see in Figure 9-1, the default settings
are great even for severe cases of red-
eye.
The Red Eye tool finds red and not green. For green-eye (in photos of animals)
and too-bright white reflections from eyes, use the Brush tool (as you see in
Figure 9-2). Set the foreground color
to black; in the Options bar, select
the Luminosity blending mode and
an Opacity of about 50%. Use a brush
diameter just slightly larger than the
pupil and a brush hardness of about
75%. Click once and evaluate the
result; if necessary, reduce the
Opacity to 20% and click again.
Here’s one more red-eye/green-eye
trick: The Sponge tool, set to
Desaturate in the Options bar, does a
great job with mild cases of red-eye.
Figure 9-1: Click with the Red Eye tool to
replace red with natural-looking black.
Figure 9-2: When the Red Eye tool won’t work,
use the Brush tool.

The digital fountain of youth
At the end of Chapter 5, I show an example of using the Dodge tool to fade
wrinkles without removing them completely. Photoshop, being that complex
and capable animal we enjoy so much, has lots of other ways to minimize or
eliminate wrinkles. Among the most powerful tools for this job are the
Healing Brush, the Patch tool, and the Clone Stamp.
Both the Healing Brush and the Patch tool work by copying texture from one
area to another. You can, for example, copy smooth skin onto a wrinkled area,
smoothing the wrinkles while retaining the area’s general tonality and color.
To work with the Healing Brush, Option-click (Mac)/Alt-click (Windows) the
area from which you wish to copy; then click and drag over the area that
you’re fixing. When you select the Aligned option from the Options bar, you
maintain the relationship between the point from which you’re healing and
the area over which you drag. No matter where you move the cursor, the
source point stays the same distance and direction. When repairing areas of a
face, however, you might find it easier to clear the Aligned check box. Every
time you release the mouse button, you start over from the same source
point. By using short strokes, you can heal from the same source area to any
area of your image.
To work with the Patch tool, make a selection (using any of Photoshop’s
selection techniques) and then drag with the Patch tool. Depending on which
option you select from the Options bar, you can either select and drag the
damaged area to a good area (select Source from the Options bar), or you
can select a good area and drag to the damaged area (select Destination).
You can use both the Healing Brush and the Patch tool to apply a predefined
pattern, too. That can be handy for adding a texture where one doesn’t
already exist in your image.
Like the Healing Brush, you Option-click/Alt-click with the Clone Stamp to set
the area from which you’re copying and then paint over an area to make a
change. The Healing Brush copies texture, but the Clone Stamp copies pixels,
completely replacing the area over which you drag. (That is, of course, sub-
ject to the blending mode and opacity that you select from the Options bar.)
Like the Healing Brush, the Clone Stamp offers the Aligned option. Figure 9-3
shows a comparison of wrinkle reduction using the Healing Brush and the
Clone Stamp set to Normal and 100% opacity. (If you use the Clone Stamp to
repair skin, reduce the opacity and make sure to select a source area that has
similar skin color and lighting.)

Figure 9-3: Use the Healing Brush (lower left) instead of the Clone Stamp (lower right) to
minimize wrinkles.
Dieting digitally
You can certainly use the Clone Stamp tool to reduce a bit of a bulge at the
waistline or below an upper arm, but you might find it easier (and more nat-
ural looking) to make a selection and rotate the outer edge inward a bit. Take
a look at Figure 9-4. Although this
subject hardly has what you’d call a
“spare tire,” that bit of extra sticking
out above her skirt isn’t particularly
flattering. Make a selection with the
Lasso tool that includes some of the
background and some skin (or shirt
or dress). Press Ô+T/Ctrl+T to enter
Free Transform (or use the Edit➪
Transform➪Rotate command). Drag
Figure 9-4: Rotate a selection to pinch in a
waist.

the point of rotation (the little crosshair symbol in the middle of the bounding
box) to the top of the bounding box, and then position the cursor slightly
outside the bounding box and drag to rotate. When you’re satisfied, press
Return/Enter to accept the transformation. (With complex backgrounds, you
might need to do a little cloning to even things out.)
When working with double chins, your best bet is usually to minimize rather
than eliminate. Putting a skinny neck under a fleshy face looks unnatural. You
can certainly tuck in the sides of the second chin a bit by using the rotate
method, but rely on the Burn tool to darken. By darkening the excess flesh
under the chin, you make it appear to be in shadow — and, therefore, under
the actual chin (see Figure 9-5). Use
the Dodge tool (if necessary) to hide
any creases or wrinkles associated
with the excess chin. Redefine a 
natural-looking jaw line and chin —
but once again, remember that the
result must not only look natural, 
but it must also be acceptable to 
the client.
When working with the Burn and Dodge tools, don’t forget to reduce the
Exposure setting in the Options bar — 15%–20% is plenty strong for this 
type of work. You’ll also want to juggle between Highlights and Midtones 
(the Range setting in the Options bar) when creating an artificial shadow on a
double chin with the Burn tool. Zoom in when doing this sort of work, 
but also open a second window via Window➪Arrange➪New Window for 
[filename] to keep an eye on the overall impact of your changes.
You can use Photoshop’s Filter➪Liquify feature to push, pull, twist, pucker,
bloat, and otherwise manipulate pixels into the shape and position you need.
There’s really nothing more powerful when it comes to reconfiguring a figure.
In Figure 9-6, you see how leveling off a beltline in Liquify is sometimes all
that’s needed to restore that trim-man-she-married look. And a little touch-up
with the Dodge and Burn tools can eliminate the wrinkles in the shirt, helping
improve the overall appearance of the image by reducing distraction.
(Chapter 15 has full info on using Liquify.)

De-glaring glasses
Although hindsight is usually 20/20, many of the rest of us need spectacles.
Unfortunately, those eyeglasses can be a photographer’s nightmare! The
reflections off glass are usually specular highlights — that is, areas of pure
white with absolutely no detail in them. To properly evaluate flash reflections
in eyeglasses, open the Info palette and move the cursor through the area. If
you see a noticeable variation among the RGB values in the Info palette, you
might be able to restore the area with the Burn tool.
If the Info palette shows RGB values of 255/255/255 or close to it, the area has
no detail. Use the Clone Stamp tool to copy over the area from another part
of the image (or you can use another image as the source point for the Clone
Stamp).
In severe cases, you might need to copy from another photo of the same
person. When possible, say in a portrait sitting, try to take one shot of the
subject without eyeglasses, just in case.

Whitening teeth
Teeth generally are not truly white (unless somebody has spent a lot of time
and money getting ready for a portfolio shoot). Instead, you see shades of
ivory and yellow in teeth, but they don’t necessarily have to be unattractive
or distracting shades of yellow. Use the Dodge tool to lighten teeth. From the
Options bar, set the tool to Midtones (not Highlights) and an Exposure of
perhaps 30% for front teeth. Then switch to Shadows and lighten those
molars visible in back. Don’t overdo it — remember that folks who don’t
make their living in Hollywood or on
TV generally don’t have snow-white
teeth. Figure 9-7 shows normal
people teeth, “improved” normal
people teeth, and Hollywood teeth.
Balance your judgment with the
client’s needs.
Reducing Noise in Your Images
Moving from the darkroom to digital has saved thousands of dollars in film
and processing costs (not to mention a reduction in environmental degrada-
tion) but has added a new set of challenges to the art and business of photog-
raphy. Perhaps foremost among the problems presented by digital
photography is noise. Those pesky red, green, and blue (or light and dark)
specks in an image can ruin a digital photo. Noise is generally most promi-
nent in shadow areas and against dark colors in your images.
If your camera lets you select an ISO setting, you can help minimize digital
noise in your photos by using a low ISO. Sometimes you do need to shoot the
equivalent of faster film, such as at sporting events. However, when you have
a choice, use a low ISO to minimize noise. And using a tripod can help, too!
Decreasing digital noise
Photoshop CS2 adds a new weapon to your arsenal in the war on noise. You
find the new Reduce Noise filter under the Filter➪Noise menu. As you see in
Figure 9-8, it does a very good job of neutralizing the random red, green, and
blue pixels while preserving detail in the image.
Notice that Reduce Noise also offers a Remove JPEG Artifact option. When
saving in the JPEG file format, you compromise between image quality and
smaller file size. The smaller the file, the greater the likelihood of compres-
sion damage to your image. That damage generally shows itself as visible
lines between blocks of pixels measuring eight pixels square.

Figure 9-8: The Reduce Noise filter keeps your image sharp while eliminating RGB noise.
You’ll also find the Color Replacement tool very handy for noise reduction,
especially in areas of rather uniform color. Option-click/Alt-click right in the
area to set the foreground color; then simply paint away the digital noise. As
you move from area to area in your image, Option-click/Alt-click to pick up a
new foreground color.
Eliminating luminance noise
In addition to the red, green, and blue specks of digital noise, you might face
luminance noise, which is the bright and dark specks sprinkled throughout
your photo. The Photoshop CS2 new
Surface Blur filter can handle lumi-
nance noise, but you have more con-
trol over the result when working
with the Blur➪Smart Blur filter.
Unlike Surface Blur, Smart Blur lets
you enter fractions for both the
Radius and Threshold values (as
shown in Figure 9-9). Sometimes the
difference between a 1.5-pixel blur
and a 2-pixel blur is the salvation of
the fine detail in your image.
Figure 9-9: The Smart Blur filter is a good choice
for luminance noise reduction.

Fooling Around with Mother Nature
Sometimes a very nice photo has something in it that you want gone . . . a
piece of litter, telephone lines in the distance, a building that distracts from
the composition, or perhaps a person whose memory you’d like to erase.
Other times, everything in the image is fine, but the image looks wrong
because of the angle at which the image was taken. Photoshop offers you
quite a variety of tools and techniques for cutting out, copying over, cleaning
up, and even correcting perspective.
Removing the unwanted from photos
Perhaps the easiest way to remove something from an image is to crop the
photo: that is, cut off that part of the picture. This technique is easy enough if
that piece of litter or whatever happens to be at the edge of the image and
cropping won’t ruin your composition. However, when you must cover up
rather than crop out, consider both cloning and copy/paste.
One of the keys to using the Clone Stamp tool is keeping an eye on your work.
Zoom in close so you can work precisely but use the Window➪Arrange➪New
Window for [filename] command. Keep that second window zoomed out and
off to the side so you can monitor your progress while you work. I also like to
keep a copy of the original image open for reference. You can make a copy 
of the file with the Image➪Duplicate command or by clicking the left button
at the bottom of the History palette. In Figure 9-10, you see the original image
to the upper-left, the zoomed-in work image below, and a zoomed-out second
window for the work image. (The Navigator palette shows you what part of
the zoomed-in image is visible.)
Here are some tips for working effectively with the Clone Stamp tool:
 Work on a separate layer. Before cloning, click the New Layer button at
the bottom of the Layers palette and click the Sample All Layers button
on the Options bar. By cloning to the new layer, you protect yourself
from irreversible errors (you can always erase part of the upper layer)
and can show/hide your work layer to check progress. If the image
already has multiple layers and you want to clone from only one, hide
the other layers in the Layers palette by clicking the eyeball icons in the
left column.
 If color or pattern is uniform, clone near. If, for example, you’re remov-
ing a power line in a beautiful blue sky, clone from right above and
below the power line so that you get the best possible color match. For
delicate jobs or larger items, you can clone by halves — clone half from
one side and the other half from the other side.

 To avoid a recognizable pattern, clone far. In Figure 9-10, I cloned over
the bicycle handles in the lower-right corner of the image from a variety
of places to avoid creating any recognizable replicas of nearby flowers
or rocks. You should, however, try to clone from areas that are approxi-
mately the same distance from the lens as the area over which you’re
cloning. If you clone from the far distance into the foreground, you’ll have
a recognizable size mismatch and perhaps a focal difference as well.
 To copy areas or objects, use Aligned. In Figure 9-10, I copied patches of
wildflowers, grass, and rock. By using the Aligned option, the relation-
ship between the point from which I sampled and the point to which I
cloned remained constant when I released the mouse button. To pick a
new source point, I Option-clicked/Alt-clicked.
 To repeat a pattern or texture, don’t use Aligned. If you have a specific
object, texture, or pattern that you want to replicate in more than one
area, you can clear the Aligned check box on the Options bar. Every time
you release the mouse button, the source point returns to the exact spot
where you Option-clicked/Alt-clicked. You can copy the same part of the
image into as many different places as you choose.
Figure 9-10: Use the Clone Stamp to remove unwanted bits and pieces.

 You can vary the tool’s opacity and blending mode. Generally speak-
ing, when you want to hide something in the image, use the Normal
blending mode and 100% opacity. However, you can also clone with
other blending modes and reduce opacity to subdue rather than hide
and, of course, for fun special effects.
 Adjust your brush size on the fly. Pressing the left and right brackets
keys (to the right of P on the standard English keyboard) decreases and
increases the brush diameter without having to open the Brushes
palette.
 Check the brush’s hardness and spacing settings. To get the smoothest
result for general cloning, reduce the brush’s Hardness setting to about
25%, allowing edges to blend. There are times, however, when you’ll
need a more distinct edge to the brush, but you’ll rarely need to clone
with a brush set harder than perhaps 90%. In the full-size Brushes
palette (found by default in the Palette Well), I generally set the Spacing
(in Brush Tip Shape) to 1% for cloning to ensure the edge is as smooth
as possible.
The Spot Healing Brush, new in Photoshop CS2, works much like the Healing
Brush to repair and replace texture. However, instead of designating a source
point by Option-clicking/Alt-clicking, the Spot Healing Brush samples from
the immediate surrounding area, which makes it perfect for repairing little
irregularities in an area of rather consistent texture. The Spot Healing Brush
could, for example, do a fine job with individual flowers and small rocks in
Figure 9-10, but it’s not up to the task of hiding a bicycle or a steer.
Larger challenges sometime require more drastic measures, such as dupli-
cate layers and layer masks. Take a look at Figure 9-11. At the top left, you see
the “before” photo: at the top right, the “after” image. Below are images from
three key steps in the process.
Here are the steps I took to remove the boy from the group photo:
1. Decide what needs to go and how best to cover it.
In this case, the young man is no longer welcome in the group photo.
The easiest way to remove him (without using scissors and leaving an
empty hole) is to move the two young women at his right to the left.
2. Make a selection of the area that you’ll use to cover.
I used a large rectangular selection that included everything to the right
of the young man.
3. Copy to a new layer.
Use the keyboard shortcut Ô+J/Ctrl+J to copy the selection to a new
layer.

Figure 9-11: A new layer with a layer mask and — POOF — he’s gone!
4. Position the new layer.
Use the Move tool to slide the new layer over the top of the area you
want to remove.
5. Add a layer mask.
Click the Add Layer Mask button at the bottom of the Layers palette,
and then paint with black in the layer mask to hide areas of the upper
layer. As you can see in the lower-left in Figure 9-11, the upper layer
covers areas of the lower layer that need to show (such as the man’s
head), creating an unnatural shadow pattern. The layer mask in the
lower-center image exposes as much of the lower layer as possible, leav-
ing the upper layer visible only where necessary to show the two young
women and their shadows as well as to hide the people on the lower
layer.

6. Look for and adjust anomalies.
In the lower-center of Figure 9-11, you see that one woman’s foot should
be in the man’s shadow. I added a new layer, made a selection of the area
that should be in shadow, filled with the color of the toes that are
already in shadow, and then used the Multiply blending mode and the
Opacity slider to match the original shadow. (See the lower-right image
in Figure 9-11.)
7. Crop.
Glancing again at the lower-center image in Figure 9-11, you see the area
that needs to be cropped, off to the right. Using a rectangular selection
of everything I want to save and the Image➪Crop command, and the
alteration is complete.
You can use a similar technique to move something in your image to a new
location. As shown in Figure 9-12, copy the entire image, reposition it, use a
layer mask to hide parts of the upper layer, and clone to remove anything not
needed on the exposed areas of the lower layer. In Figure 9-12, the back-
ground layer is copied and moved upward (after using the Image➪Canvas
Size command to expand the canvas), and a layer mask hides everything
except the boy, his racket, and the ball. On the lower layer, the boy is cloned
out. (The look of surprise from the boy in the red hat in the background is
simply a fortuitous coincidence that seems to add creditability to the
adjusted image.)

Eliminating the lean: Fixing perspective
When you take a photograph at an angle, perhaps shooting upward at a build-
ing, you get foreshortening, with the distant part of the subject shrinking. You
can use Photoshop’s Edit➪Transform➪Perspective command to fix the prob-
lem. Make a selection, choose the Perspective command, and then drag out-
ward on a corner of the edge that’s too small (or inward on the corner of an
edge that’s too large). When the vertical and horizontal lines in the image are
straight, press the keyboard shortcut Ô+T/Ctrl+T to enter Free Transform
mode. Make the subject a little taller, too. As you see in Figure 9-13, fixing per-
spective properly also requires a height adjustment. Press Return/Enter
when finished.
Figure 9-13: Squaring an image with Perspective usually also requires a height adjustment.
You can also use Photoshop’s Crop tool to fix perspective. Mark the
Perspective check box on the Options bar before dragging a bounding box.
For best results, position the four corners of the bounding box on visible cor-
ners of something in the image that should be rectangular or square; then
drag the side handles outward to expand the bounding box to encompass
your image. Press Return/Enter when done. Figure 9-14 shows that the Crop
tool does a good job of adjusting the height to fit the perspective.

Figure 9-14: The Crop tool’s Perspective option does a great job of fixing perspective.
Rotating images precisely
Buried under the Eyedropper in Photoshop’s Toolbox is the little-known
Measure tool. Generally, you use it in conjunction with the Info palette to find
distances and angles in your image. You can also use it to make sure that you
apply the exact amount of rotation needed for your image. Select the
Measure tool, drag it along any line in your image that should be vertical or
horizontal, and then choose Image➪Rotate Canvas➪Arbitrary. The angle of
the Measure tool will already be waiting for you in the dialog box, so you
need only click OK to precisely rotate your image.
One final thought for this chapter: When you come across an image that
requires more fixing than you have time for, or one with such severe lumi-
nance noise that smoothing removes too much detail, or just a problem
photo in general, head for the Filter Gallery. It’s amazing how many flaws you
can hide with a few artistic effects. Creating an artistic rendering of an image
is often preferable to deleting a lousy photo. Blur away the noise and add a
canvas texture with the Texturizer filter. Blown out highlights? Try the
Colored Pencil filter. When faced with lemons, think of the Filter Gallery as
your own personal lemonade stand.

Creating “Art” in
Photoshop

In this part . . .
P
hotoshop is far more than just a pixel-
pushing image editor. More than merely per-
fecting excellent photography, you can create art
in Photoshop. And Photoshop includes a very
powerful painting engine. You need to understand
the extremely complex Brushes palette and paint-
ing tools, all covered here.
Chapter 10 introduces you to compositing (com-
bining images into a piece of artwork) and
working with layers. You also see the powerful
Extract feature, which is a great way to cut and
paste from one image to another. Chapter 11 intro-
duces you to Photoshop’s shape layers and vector
paths, which are illustration tools used to add spe-
ciﬁc elements.
In Chapter 12, I show you how to work with the
Styles palette and how to create your own custom
styles — and make sure you don’t lose them by
mistake! Chapter 13 looks at the many tools,
palettes, and commands you have available in
Photoshop to add text and type. Chapter 15 intro-
duces you to those ﬁlters you need on a near-daily
basis, and then shows you how to work in the
Filter Gallery and in Liquify.

A
pharaoh’s head on a lion body. Lion claws on a dragon body. As we
know from the Sphinx and the mythological griffin, compositing ele-
ments has been around a lot longer than Photoshop (but Photoshop certainly
makes it easier!). Take part of one image, drop it onto another image, and sell
the composite to the tabloids for thousands of dollars. (One of the more infa-
mous misuses of Photoshop occurred during the 2004 U.S.
Presidential campaign, with the publication of a fake photo of
candidate John Kerry with actress and anti-war activist
Jane Fonda.) Photoshop offers you incredible power —
use it wisely!
In this chapter, I show you some basic techniques for
compositing (combining two or more images into a
single picture), how to use Extract to select part of
an image for compositing, the new Vanishing Point
feature, and then wrap up the chapter with a look at
a couple of automated features for combining
images.
Compositing Images: 1 + 1 = 1
You make a selection in one image, copy, switch to another image, and paste.
There you have it — the basic composite! Pretty simple, isn’t it? Whether
you’re putting together two images or creating complex artwork involving
dozens of elements, the trick is making the composited image look natural.
The key techniques are blending the edges of your selections and matching
color among the elements.

192
Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
Understanding layers
When you put together images, you work with layers. Think of layers in
Photoshop as stackable elements, each of which holds part of your image.
Where an upper layer is transparent, the lower layers show through. Where
the upper layer has pixels that aren’t transparent, those pixels either block or
interact with pixels on the lower layer. (You control that interaction with
blending modes and opacity, explained later in this chapter.)
Take a look at Figure 10-1 (which reveals how Figure 13-2 is created). The
Layers palette shows the individual layers and their content. The individual
elements come together to create a single image.
Figure 10-1: Elements on different layers form a single image.
Blending Mode menu
Link button

You can manipulate the content of each layer independently — moving, resiz-
ing, erasing, painting, or adjusting color and tonality — to suit your needs
and artistic vision. You can link two or more layers so that they maintain
their positions relative to each other as you move them. (Shift-click to select
the layers; then click the Link button at the bottom of the Layers palette — 
a Link symbol appears to the right of linked layers when active in the layers
palette.) You might, for example, have a type layer that you want to remain
centered in a rectangle. Link the two, and you can move the rectangle and
type together without knocking them out of alignment.
The left column in the Layers palette, known as the eyeball column (for an
obvious reason) allows you to hide a layer, making the content of the layer
invisible. The pixels are still there; they’re just not visible. Click the eyeball
icon to hide the layer, and then click the empty space in the left column to
make the layer visible again. You can hide and show adjustment layers, too,
which lets you see their impact on the image. (Read about adjustment layers
in Chapter 8.)
One key concept about layers is well illustrated in Figure 10-1. The higher a
layer is in the stacking order (the order of layers in the Palette from the top
down), the more “in front” it will be. The layers Clouds-Dark and Clouds-Light
are on top of everything in the image. The layer Man is in front of everything
except the clouds. Because of the stacking order, the man appears to be walking
on top of the musical notes, and the notes appear to be on top of the compact
disc.
You can also create groups, which are two or more layers packaged together
in the Layers palette so that you can work with them together. (In prior ver-
sions of Photoshop, you had layer sets. Groups are, generally speaking, com-
parable to layer sets in form and function.) As you can see in the Layers
palette in Figure 10-1, you can have nested groups: a group within a group. The
group named Background Items includes another group, named Sun, as well
as several layers that are not part of the Sun subgroup.
Using the basic blending modes
The pop-up menu at the top-left corner of the Layers palette offers almost
two dozen different blending modes. A layer’s blending mode determines how
the pixels on that layer interact with the visible pixels on the layers below.
Because a layer named Background can’t have any layers below it, you can’t
change the blending mode of background layers. Convert a background layer
to a regular layer by changing the layer’s name in the Layers palette. Simply
double-click a layer name in the layers palette and type to rename the layer.
In Figure 10-2, the black-white and rainbow gradients each use the blending
mode shown by the text outline. (You can see the original gradients in the
Normal stripe.) Normal, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, and Luminosity are the
blending modes you’re most likely to use regularly.
193
Chapter 10: Combining Images

194
Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
Figure 10-2: Blending modes control the interaction between the gradients and the photo.
When working with layer blending modes, always keep in mind that you can
use the layer’s Opacity and Fill sliders to help determine the layer’s visibility
and appearance.
The Layers palette blending mode pop-up menu is divided into six sections,
based loosely on how the pixels on the upper layer affect the pixels on the
lower layer. Here’s a quick look at how you use the key layer blending modes:
 Normal: Photoshop picks Normal by default. Pixels on the upper layer
completely hide the pixels on the lower layers (subject, of course, to the
Opacity and the Fill settings). Use Normal to show the content of the
layer without any interaction with lower layers.
 Multiply: The Multiply blending mode darkens where your upper layer
is dark and ignores white. Use Multiply when you want the upper layer
to darken but not obscure the lower layer and also for shadows and
dark glow effects.
 Screen: The Screen blending mode — the opposite of Multiply — uses
lighter pixels to lighten the pixels below. Use it for highlights and light-
colored glows.

 Overlay: Overlay works like a combination of Multiply and Screen. Use it
when you’re working with an upper layer that includes both dark and
light pixels that you want to interact with pixels on layers below.
 Soft Light: Soft Light is a subtle blending mode. Like Overlay, where your
upper layer’s pixels are dark, the lower layer is darkened; where they’re
light, the lower layer is lightened. Soft Light is like adding a diffused
spotlight to the lower layer — useful for adding a little drama to the
lower layer.
 Hard Light: The Hard Light
blending mode is much like a
more vivid version of Soft Light.
Use it to add a lot more drama
to the lower layer. Hard Light
works well with colors that
aren’t overwhelmingly bright
(see Figure 10-3).
 Difference: Where the upper
layer (using the Difference
blending mode) and the lower
layer are exactly the same, you
see black. Where the two layers
are different, you see bright-
ness or color. For example, use
Difference (temporarily) when
trying to align two overlapping photos. Set the upper layer to Difference,
move the upper layer until the areas of overlap show black, and then
switch the upper layer’s blending mode back to Normal.
 Color: When the upper layer is
set to Color, the lower layer’s
brightness and saturation are
retained, and the upper layer’s
color is used. If you want to
create a color picture from a
grayscale picture, convert the
image to RGB (Image➪Mode➪
RGB), add a new layer, change
the upper layer’s blending
mode to Color, and paint on the
upper layer (as shown in 
Figure 10-4).
 Luminosity: When the upper
layer is set to Luminosity, the
color and saturation of the
lower layer are retained, and
the brightness (luminosity) of the upper layer is applied. Because the
luminosity (dark and light) generally provides texture, use this blending
mode to produce detail in the lower layer.

Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
Opacity, transparency, and layer masks
Blending modes help determine how pixels on an upper layer interact with
pixels on a lower layer, but those upper pixels have to be visible before they
can do any interacting at all. When looking at any pixel on a layer, you have
to consider four factors about transparency:
 Whether the pixel has any color to start with
 The Opacity value
 The Fill value
 Whether there’s a layer mask
When you add a layer and paint on it, for exam-
ple, you color some of the pixels yet leave other
pixels transparent. (Every layer in every image
is completely filled with pixels, whether visible
or not.) If nothing is done to color some pixels,
they remain transparent, and the lower layers
can be seen through that part of your upper
layer. In Figure 10-5, the words upper layer are
on a separate layer above the layer containing
the words Lower Layer. Where the upper layer
has transparent pixels, the lower layer shows
through.
A layer named Background in the Layers palette
can have no transparent pixels.
Lowering the Opacity or the Fill slider in the Layers palette (or the Layer
Style dialog box) makes all visible pixels on the layer partially transparent:
The pixels on layers below can be seen through the upper layer’s pixels. (The
Opacity slider controls the pixels on the layer and any layer style; the Fill
slider works only on the pixels, not the layer style. In Chapter 12, you can
read about the Glass Type technique, which demonstrates the difference.)
Chapter 8 discusses layer masks and vector masks. Remember that any pixel
inside the mask is visible, and any pixel outside the mask is transparent,
regardless of whether it has color. But, as you can guess, any transparent
pixels inside the mask remain transparent.
Creating clipping groups
This being Photoshop, here is yet another way to restrict the visibility of
pixels on an upper layer: clipping groups. Clipping an upper layer to the layer
below, in effect, creates a mask on the upper layer. The opacity of the pixels
on the lower layer is applied to the pixels on your upper layer. Where the
lower layer is transparent, the upper layer (regardless of original content)
Figure 10-5: Where you see the
lower layer, the upper layer is
transparent.

becomes transparent. In the Layers palette, Option-click (Mac)/Alt-click
(Windows) the line between two layers to clip the upper layer to the lower.
(When you hold down the Option/Alt key, the cursor turns to the wedding
rings icon.) Figure 10-6 shows how Figure 13-6 is created with a clipping group.
Figure 10-6: Option/Alt-click the line between two layers to clip the upper to the lower.
After Option/Alt-clicking the line between Layer 0 and the layer named GAR-
DENS, the upper layer is visible only within the text on the lower layer. The
upper layer is indented to the right in the Layers palette, with a downward-
pointing arrow, to let you know that it’s clipped to the layer below. Note that
the upper layer’s thumbnail in the Layers palette shows the entire layer, not
just the visible area.
Photoshop CS2 lets you show the layer thumbnails in a new way. In the past,
the entire layer, including all areas of transparency, showed in the thumbnail.
Although that gives you a good indication of how large or small the particular
layer’s content is in the image, layers with little content have little to show in
the thumbnail. By using the Palette Options (from the Layers palette menu)
or Control-clicking/right-clicking the empty area at the bottom of the palette,
you can elect to show a thumbnail that includes only non-transparent areas
of the layer. Little things fill the thumbnail, but they also appear out of pro-
portion to the other thumbnails. Your choice.

Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
Making composited elements
look natural
One of the keys to compositing two images is a
slight fade to the edges of the element you’re
adding to the original image. That fade, called
feathering, makes the edges of the image appear
to fall off into the distance very slightly rather
than having a sharply defined edge that sticks out
like a sore thumb. (See Chapter 8 for full informa-
tion on feathering.) You have a number of ways
to feather a selection, including the following:
 Use the Feathering field on the Options
bar before you use a selection tool.
 Choose Select➪Feather after you make a
selection.
 Apply a slight blur to a saved selection’s
alpha channel in the Layers palette (or to
a layer mask).
Matching color between two layers is also 
critical for a natural appearance. Take a look 
at Chapter 6 for full information on Match Color
and Photoshop’s other color adjustment 
capabilities.
You also need to be aware of perspective and
scale. When an element in your composited
image seems to be too large or too small, or
when it seems to be facing the wrong
way or standing on air, rely on the
Edit➪Transform commands.
Although the Scale and Rotate 
commands are self-explanatory,
Figure 10-7 shows visually how you
can use the other Transform com-
mands, such as Skew, Perspective,
and the new Warp command. Drag
the bounding box anchor points to
transform the selected pixels.
The new Edit➪Transform➪Warp
command adds a simple mesh over
the content of the layer or selection.
You click and drag the direction lines
for the corners of the mesh and at the
intersection of mesh lines to distort
Figure 10-7: Drag anchor points
to transform.
Figure 10-8: Use the Warp transformation to
distort layers or selections.

your artwork. As you see in Figure 10-8, the Warp distortion gives you the
level of control previously offered only in Photoshop’s Liquify feature (dis-
cussed in Chapter 15). You can also use Warp with paths and shape layers.
Selecting with Extract
To copy something from one image to another, you must first make a selec-
tion. You read a lot about making selections and creating masks in Chapter 8,
but one more Photoshop feature deserves attention: Filter➪Extract. Extract
is great for making tough selections, such as flyaway hair and various types
of fringe. Here’s how to use Extract:
1. Use the Highlighter tool to trace along the edges you want to select.
Try to center the green highlighting on the edge, including all the fringe
and individual hairs within the green streak.
2. Click with the Fill tool (it looks like the Paint Bucket tool) inside the
highlighted edge, identifying the part of the image you’re extracting.
If the Fill tool fills the entire image, look for a break in your green high-
lighter line where the fill is leaking. The highlighting should go from edge
to edge or completely encircle the area you want to extract.
3. Click OK.
As you can see in Figure 10-9, Extract is also suitable for irregular horizons
and other such situations in which you might need to extract your fore-
ground to paste in front of a prettier background.
Figure 10-9: Identify what parts of the image to select, and let Extract do the work.
199
Chapter 10: Combining Images

Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
Here are a few tricks to clean up irregularities along the edge of your
extracted image:
 Duplicate the layer. Drag the extracted layer to the New Layer button at
the bottom of the Layers palette a few times to duplicate it. Any semi-
transparent pixels along the edge become more opaque. When the edge
looks good, use the Layers palette menu command Merge Visible to
create a single layer.
 Paint with the History Brush. Use the History Brush to paint back areas
that should not have become transparent.
 Erase excess. If Extract misses the edge in places, you can grab the
Eraser tool and eliminate those areas manually.
Vanishing Point!
When combining images to create a scene, you might find a need to add tex-
ture or a pattern along what is supposed to be a three-dimensional object.
You might, for example, add a product box to a photo of a kitchen and need
to add a logo to the front of the box. Or maybe you will create a room, per-
haps in a castle high on a hill, and you’ll need to add a realistic stone texture
to the walls. Use the new Photoshop CS2 Vanishing Point feature to “map” a
pattern to angled surfaces, such as walls, floors, buildings, and boxes.
Vanishing Point, using information that you provide, automatically deter-
mines the correct angle, scale, and perspective. (Vanishing Point is rather
complex, so for simple jobs, you might want to stick with the Paste and
Edit➪Transform commands.)
To use Vanishing Point, you follow a specific sequence of steps:
1. Copy your pattern.
Open whatever pattern file (or texture or color or logo or whatever)
you’re going to add to the walls or sides in your image, make a selection,
and then choose Edit➪Copy. You can now close the pattern file.
2. Make a selection in your working image.
Identify where you want the pattern to be applied. If you’re working with
walls, for example, make a selection that includes the walls but doesn’t
include windows and doors.
3. Open Vanishing Point (Filter➪Vanishing Point).
The Vanishing Point window opens, displaying your image.

4. Create planes on your image in the Vanishing Point window.
a. Select the Create Plane tool (the second tool from the top on the left
edge of the window).
b. Click on your image where you want to place the three corners of
your plane, and then move the cursor to the fourth corner.
You see the plane extending along the last two sides.
c. When the cursor is in position, click to create the plane.
If the plane is yellow or red rather than blue, it’s not aligned prop-
erly. Drag the corners of the plane to realign them, using the Edit
Plane tool (the top tool on the left). Drag the side anchor points
outward to expand the plane’s mesh to cover the whole wall or
side.
d. Create perpendicular planes by holding down the Ô/Ctrl key and
dragging the side anchor point at the point where the two planes
should meet.
If the second plane’s angle is off a little, drag one of the corner
anchor points to adjust it. In Figure 10-10, you see two perpendicu-
lar planes.
Figure 10-10: Use the Create Planes tool to identify surfaces.
201
Chapter 10: Combining Images

202
Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
5. Paste your pattern.
a. Press Ô+V/Ctrl+V to paste your pattern into Vanishing Point.
Your pattern is pasted into the upper-left corner of the Vanishing
Point window.
b. Select the Marquee tool (third from the top) and drag the pattern into
your plane.
The pattern automatically adopts the orientation of the plane. If
necessary, press T on your keyboard, and then rotate and scale the
pattern.
6. Replicate the pattern.
Unless your pattern is an exact fit, you need to replicate it to fill the
plane. With the Marquee tool selected, hold down the Option/Alt key.
Then click and drag in your pattern to replicate it. Repeat as necessary
to fill the plane. As you see in Figure 10-11, you can replicate a relatively
small pattern to fill a large area.
Figure 10-11: Option/Alt-drag with the Marquee tool to copy your pasted selection.

If the lighting in your original image varies, set the Healing pop-up menu
(at the top of the window, only with the Marquee tool active) to
Luminance. That helps maintain the original lighting on the new pattern
or texture.
7. Click OK to exit Vanishing Point and apply the pattern or texture to
your image.
After exiting Vanishing Point, you might need to do some touch-up work
on your image with the Clone Stamp tool (depending on how precise you
were when dragging). You might also, depending on the original image,
need to add a layer and paint some shadows or highlights to reproduce
the original lighting in the scene.
Here are some tips for working with Vanishing Point:
 Create accurate planes; then drag. Click in four corners of any identifi-
able area of your plane — perhaps a window — and drag the side anchor
points outward (or inward) to identify the whole plane.
 Use the X key to zoom. Pressing and holding the X key on your key-
board makes the preview area zoom to show the area where you’re
working. Release the X key to zoom back out.
 Press T to transform. After pasting your pattern, you can press T on
your keyboard and then scale and rotate your pasted pattern.
 Use the Shift key to drag in alignment. Hold down the Shift key while
Option/Alt-dragging to replicate your pattern. That keeps the new part
aligned to the old.
 Duplicate elements in the image. Make a selection with the Marquee
tool and Ô+Option-drag/Ctrl+Alt-drag to the area where you want to
place the copy.
 Paste over objects in Vanishing Point. Create your plane. Use the
Marquee tool to select an area that you want to replace, and then hold
down the Ô/Ctrl key and drag to an area that you want to paste into the
marquee selection.
 Clone in Vanishing Point. Define your plane, select the Stamp tool, and
Option/Alt-click at the source point. Release the Option/Alt key and
move the cursor to the point where you want to start cloning. When the
preview is properly aligned, click and drag to clone.
 Paint in perspective. With a plane identified, the Brush tool in Vanishing
Point shrinks or grows in accordance with your perspective plane.
 Work on an empty layer. You can add an empty layer in the Layers
palette before entering Vanishing Point. Your result is added to the new
layer, which lets you work with blending modes and opacity to merge
your pattern into the original.

Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
Putting Together Images Automatically
You have a couple of features in Photoshop CS2 that automatically combine
two or more images into a single image. You can combine overlapping images
into a panorama, or you can combine multiple exposures of the same shot
into a single well-exposed image. You’ll find both Photomerge (for panora-
mas) and Merge to HDR (for high dynamic range combined exposure images)
in Photoshop’s File➪Automate menu.
Creating panoramas with Photomerge
Sometimes a snapshot doesn’t adequately portray a scene. (It’s hard to cap-
ture the majesty of the Grand Canyon in a single frame.) For those situations,
take a series of images and combine them into one large panorama with
Photomerge.
The first step in using Photomerge successfully is taking appropriate photos.
Here are some tips:
 Use a properly leveled tripod. Use a tripod, making sure that the tripod
is steady and level so the individual photos align properly.
 Turn off auto-exposure. If you use your camera’s auto-exposure feature,
each image is actually exposed differently because of the lighting in that
frame. Instead, expose for the center (or most important) photo and use
the same settings for all shots.
 Don’t use auto-focus with zoom lenses. Auto-focus can change the zoom
factor of the lens. Instead, set the lens to manual focus after using auto-
focus on your most important shot.
 Overlap by 25 percent. One-quarter of each shot (on each side) should
overlap so that Photomerge has enough similarity between neighboring
images.
When working with images that are properly exposed and have suitable over-
lap, Photomerge is fully automated. You open Photomerge, select the images
you want to use, click OK, sit back, and watch the magic as the elements are
put into order, aligned, and blended. Okay, well, sometimes Photomerge asks
for a little help, and you need to drag pieces into position. (Put the images
into the proper order in the bin at the top before dragging them into the main
window for alignment.) Photomerge then attempts to generate a single uni-
fied whole. In Figure 10-12, three photos are merged.
Use the Save Composition As button in the top right of the Photomerge
window to save the panorama as a work in progress, to which you can return
at a later date to finish or to make changes. And pay particular attention to
the Keep as Layers check box in the lower right. Enabling this is always a
good idea so you can later realign as necessary and use adjustments (or
adjustment layers) to fine-tune the blending.

When creating a panorama of a room or some other scene that has a definite
this-point-is-farthest-from-the-camera vanishing point, use the Perspective
option. By default, the vanishing point (that farthest point) is assumed to be
in the center. If it’s not, select the Set Vanishing Point tool (third from the top
on the left) and click the correct image. When you use the Perspective
option, your panorama might appear to be pinched in the middle. Enabling
the Cylindrical Mapping option evens out the top and bottom and the per-
ceived distance (see Figure 10-13).
Figure 10-12: Photomerge aligns and blends your elements automatically.

Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
Figure 10-13: Photomerge using Perspective, with cylindrical mapping (top) and without.
Combining exposures for HDR images
A rather specialized feature, the new Photoshop CS2 Merge to HDR command
creates a composite image of two or more exposures of the same shot, taking
the best-exposed parts of each. You might, for example, take two shots of a
room, one exposed for the room itself and another exposed to capture the
detail of the scene outside the window(s). Merge to HDR takes the best of
both images and creates a single image. Here’s how:
1. Choose the File➪Automate➪
Merge to HDR command.
The Merge to HDR dialog box
makes an appearance.
2. Select the images to use.
Make sure the Attempt to
Automatically Align Source
Images check box is marked (as
shown in Figure 10-14).
Figure 10-14: Select the images to merge, and
let Merge to HDR try to align them.

3. Click OK to open Merge to HDR.
In the upper-right corner of the Merge to HDR window is the Bit Depth
option of creating a more common 16-bit image or even a highly usable
8-bit image rather than the 32-bits/channel HDR default. You can also
adjust the image by dragging the Set White Point Preview slider.
Generally speaking, the slider belongs under the right edge of the his-
togram, just where the histogram begins to rise.
In Figure 10-15, you see the two source images to the upper-left. The
merged image on the right uses the toned-down highlights of the upper
source figure and the brightened shadows of the lower source figure to
produce as much detail as possible throughout the image.
The image is generated.
Figure 10-15: Merge to HDR creates a single image from multiple exposures.
If you choose to use the 32-bits/channel option, you can save your image in
one of three file formats:
 PSD (Photoshop)
 PSB (Photoshop’s Large Document format, if activated in Photoshop’s
Preferences)
 TIFF

Part III: Creating ”Art“ in Photoshop
Keep in mind that not a lot of programs use 32-bit/channel images, and even
your editing capabilities within Photoshop are limited. But ain’t it great to
know the capability is there, just in case someday you need it? Or even if you
never need it?

M
ost of the images with which you work in Photoshop — digital photos
and scanned artwork, layers on which you paint, and filled selections —
are created with pixels. There’s also another type of artwork — vector 
art — which you create by defining a path (an outline) and adding color
within that path. That path has a very precise edge, enabling vectors (when
printed appropriately) to give you very crisp, clean lines in your
artwork.
Typically, vector art consists of specific elements
(objects) that are uniform in color (although vector art
can also include gradients). You might have, for exam-
ple, a red triangle, a blue square, and a green circle
as your logo (boring!). These three solid-color
objects are best defined as vector artwork. Vectors,
however, are not appropriate for photographic
images and other such imagery that includes subtle
transitions among colors.
In Photoshop, you have tools that create predefined
shapes; you have tools that create freeform shapes; you
have tools to edit the paths that define those shapes. You’ve
also got a palette and a bunch of menu commands. You can
even bring in shapes from Adobe Illustrator and create your own
shapes, too. After reading this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding 
of all these bits and pieces. I even tell you where to find dozens, or even 
hundreds, of custom shapes already on your computer — absolutely free!

210
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Pixels, Paths, and You
The vast majority of the artwork with which you work (or play) in Photoshop
is raster artwork. Raster imagery consists of uniformly sized squares of color
(pixels), placed in rows and columns (the raster). Digital photos, scanned
images, and just about anything that you put on a layer in Photoshop con-
sists of pixels. While you edit the image, you’re changing the color of the indi-
vidual pixels, sometimes in subtle ways and sometimes in dramatic ways.
Vector artwork is a horse of another color. Rather than pixels, vector art con-
sists of a mathematically defined path to which you add color. In a dedicated
vector art program, such as Adobe
Illustrator, the path produces the
shape of the object, and you add
color along the path (stroke) or
within the path (fill) or both to make
the shape become an object.
Photoshop simulates vector artwork
using vector paths on shape layers to
hide parts of a layer, so you can fill
the “shape” but not add a stroke to
the path. (A shape layer is filled with
a specific color, gradient, or pattern;
and a vector mask determines what
part of the layer is visible.)
Remember that you can use layer
styles in conjunction with shape
layers to simulate strokes and other
effects.
Figure 11-1 shows a fine example of
vector artwork. Observe that each
element in the image consists of a
single color. Each section of the
image is easily identifiable as an indi-
vidual object, consisting of a specific
color. (Remember, though, that vector objects
can be filled with gradients rather than color.)
Each element in the artwork is defined by its
path, which consists of a number of path seg-
ments. In Figure 11-2, you see the path that
defines the woman’s hair. (You read about the
anatomy of a path later in this chapter, in the
section “Understanding paths.”)
©PhotoSpin, PhotoSpin image #PI009008
Figure 11-1: Each element in vector art has a
single specific color.
Figure 11- 2: Paths define the
outline of an object — the
woman’s hair in this case.

When artwork is defined by pixels, the little square corners of the individual
pixels can be noticeable along curves and diagonal lines. With vector art-
work, the path is sharp, and the edges are well defined. However, to truly get
the best appearance from vector art or vector type, the artwork must be
printed to a PostScript-capable device, such as a laser printer. PostScript is a
page-description language that takes advantage of the mathematical descrip-
tions of vector art. When you print to an inkjet printer, the vector art is con-
verted to pixels. If you print to such a non-PostScript device, use a high
image resolution for best output — 300 pixels per inch (ppi) is usually good.
A vector path can be scaled (changed in size) almost infinitely without losing
its appearance. A vector logo can be used for both a business card and a bill-
board without loss of quality because the path is mathematically scaled
before the stroke or fill is added. Raster art, on the other hand, can be
severely degraded by scaling. For a simple demonstration of the difference
between scaling raster art and scaling vector art, see Figure 11-3.
Figure 11-3: Using text as an example shows the advantage of vector artwork when scaling.
Type in Photoshop is vector-based: That is, it’s created with paths. Objects in
Photoshop, such as circles and squares that you create with vector paths,
can also be scaled as vector artwork. The paths are recalculated to their new
size and retain their crisp, sharp edges.

Easy Vectors: Using Shape Layers
If you made it through the preceding section, you’re officially an expert on
the theory of vector graphics. It’s time to see how you can actually create
these little devils in your artwork. Keep in mind that a vector shape in
Photoshop actually consists of a shape layer with a path that defines what
part of the layer is visible and what part is hidden. The content of the layer —
be it solid color, pattern, or gradient — is visible within the path and hidden
outside the path. The easiest way to create a shape layer in Photoshop is
with the aptly named shape tools, which are tools that automatically create a
color-filled layer with a vector path that shows/hides the layer according to
the shape selected. Could you have it any easier? Just drag a tool and create
a vector-based object!
Your basic shape tools
Rectangles, rectangles with rounded corners
(rounded rectangles), circles and ovals, multi-
sided polygons, straight lines and arrows, and a
whole boatload of special custom shapes are all
at your command with a simple click-drag. Select
the appropriate tool in the Toolbox, select the
appropriate foreground color, and click-drag to
create your object. (The various shape tools are
nested in the Toolbox, as shown in Figure 11-4.)
Sounds simple, right? It is — no tricks. Here are
some additional features to make things even
easier for you:
 Use the Shift key. Pressing the Shift key (both Mac and Windows) con-
strains proportions (maintains the width-to-height ratio) while you drag.
With the Shift key, the Rectangle tool creates squares; the Ellipse tool
creates circles; the Polygon tool creates proportional polygons; the Line
tool creates horizontal or vertical lines (or lines at 45° angles). When
using custom shapes, pressing the Shift key ensures that the shape
retains the width-to-height ratio with which it was originally defined.
 Use the Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key. The Option/Alt key creates
the object centered on the point at which you click. Without the
Option/Alt key, the object is created in whichever direction you drag.
 Use the Shift and Option/Alt key. Pressing the Shift and Option/Alt
together helps you create a proportionally constrained object, centered
on the point at which you click.
Figure 11-4: The shape tools are
collected in one spot in
Photoshop’s Toolbox.

 Use the spacebar. While you’re dragging a shape, keep the mouse
button down and press the spacebar on the keyboard. You can then drag
to reposition the object while you create it. Still keeping the mouse
button down, release the spacebar and finish dragging the object.
 Check the Options bar. When you switch from shape tool to shape tool,
the Options bar changes to fit your needs. For example, with the
Rounded Rectangle tool active, you choose the radius of the rounded
corners. The Polygon tool offers a simple field in which you choose the
number of sides for the shape. When you’re using the Line tool, choose
the thickness (weight) of the line in the Options bar. And click the trian-
gle to the right of the shape tool icons in the Options bar to add arrow-
heads to the lines.
 Change the layer content. After you create a shape layer, you can
change the color of the layer to another color, to a gradient, or even to 
a pattern. Use the menu command Layer➪Change Layer Content.
 Edit the vector path. As you can see later in this chapter (“Adding,
deleting, and moving anchor points”), you can use the Direct Selection
tool to change the course of the path, altering the appearance of the
shape layer and, therefore, the shape of the object on the shape layer.
You can easily spot a shape layer in
the Layers palette — especially
when the default layer name starts
with the word Shape. (You can, of
course, change the layer name by
double-clicking it in the Layers
palette.) You can see in the Layers
palette shown in Figure 11-5 that the
shape layer consists of a color-filled
layer (the thumbnail on the left) and
a vector layer mask (the thumbnail
on the right). That vector mask (a
rounded rectangle path, in this case)
is also visible in the Paths palette when the shape layer is selected in the
Layers palette. If you click the Background layer in the Layers palette, the
Shape 1 Vector Mask in the Paths palette is hidden.
The Custom Shape tool
Although the basic shape tools are great for circles and squares and lines and
arrows, you’ll probably get the most use out of the Custom Shape tool. With
this tool selected, you click the triangle to the right of the sample shape in
the Options bar to open the Custom Shape Picker, as shown in Figure 11-6.
The Custom Shape Picker offers a number of ready-to-use shapes. When you
213
Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
Figure 11-5: Dragging a shape tool creates a
color-filler layer with a path to define a shape.

214
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
click the triangle in the upper-right corner, you can choose from a variety of
other sets of shapes listed at the bottom of the Custom Shape Picker menu.
Figure 11-6: Load additional sets of custom shapes from the list at the bottom of the menu.
When you select a set of custom shapes from the menu (or use the Load Shapes
command to add a set of shapes not in the menu), you are asked whether you
want to add the new shapes to the current content of the palette (Append), replace
the current shapes (OK), or not add the shapes after all (Cancel). When you load
all the custom shape sets that come with Photoshop CS2, you’ve got a pretty
impressive group from which to choose!
Defining your own custom shapes
Photoshop’s 300+ predefined custom shapes cover a wide range, but they
might not fill all your needs. You can purchase commercial collections of
custom shapes from a couple of sources. You can create custom paths and
define shapes from them, too. But you’ve already got bunches of custom
shapes on your computer already, just waiting for you to use them. Select

Photoshop’s Type tool and take a look in your Font menu. Check out the
fonts already there with names like Wingdings, Webdings, Symbol, and
Dingbats. These are all examples of symbol fonts, which are fonts that have
shapes and symbols rather than letters and numbers. Many more typical
fonts also have special characters available when you use the Option/Alt key.
Here’s how you can define a custom shape from a symbol:
1. Choose File➪New to open a new document.
The document can be virtually any size and can be either grayscale or
color.
2. Select the Type tool and pick a font.
With the Type tool active, choose a symbol font from either the Options
bar or the Character palette. The font size doesn’t matter much because
you’re creating a vector-based shape that can be easily scaled.
3. Type a single symbol and then end the editing session.
Click the check mark button to the right in the Options bar, switch tools
in the Toolbox, or press Ô+Return (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows) to
end the editing session.
4. Convert the type character to a shape layer.
With the type layer active in the Layers palette, use the menu command
Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shape.
5. Define a custom shape.
Choose Edit➪Define Custom
Shape, give your new shape a
name in the Shape Name dialog
box (shown in Figure 11-7), and
save it. Your new shape is
added to the Custom Shape
palette, ready to use.
Later in this chapter, after you master using the Pen tool, remember this 
section. You can also define a custom shape from paths that you create with
the Pen tool — any shape at all!
215
Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
Figure 11-7: Name your new shape and click
OK.

216
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Remember that your custom shapes are not truly saved until you use the
Custom Shape picker menu command Save Shapes (to save all the shapes in
the palette as a single set) or the Edit➪Preset Manager command (to save a
set of selected shapes). In the Preset Manager dialog box, Ô-click/Ctrl-click
each of your custom shapes and then click the Save Set button to save them
as a set (see Figure 11-8). Until you take this step, the shapes exist only in
Photoshop’s Preferences file. If the Preferences become corrupt, you could
lose all your custom shapes. This holds true, too, for custom brushes, layer
styles, swatches, and the like — use the Preset Manager to save all your
custom items.
Figure 11-8: Use the Preset Manager to save sets of your custom shapes.

When saving custom shapes (or layer styles or brushes or any of your other
custom bits and pieces) with the Preset Manager, save them in a folder out-
side the Photoshop folder. That prevents accidental loss should you ever
need to (gasp!) reinstall Photoshop.
Changing the appearance of the shape layer
After you use any one of the numerous shape tools in the Photoshop arsenal
to add a shape layer to your artwork, you have a number of ways that you
can enhance, adjust, and simply change its appearance:
 Add a layer style. Layer styles,
such as bevels, glows, and 
shadows (applied through the
Layer➪Layer Style menu), can
certainly spice up a shape layer.
Compare, for example, the 
pair of shapes in Figure 11-9.
(Layer styles are presented in
Chapter 12.)
 Change the layer content. Via
the menu command Layer➪Change Layer Content, you can select a dif-
ferent color, a gradient, or even a pattern to fill the shape.
 Edit the path shape. Click a path with the Direct Selection tool and drag
to change the path’s shape. (This is discussed in more detail later in this
chapter.)
 Change the layer blending mode or opacity. By default, your shape
layer’s blending mode is Normal, and the Opacity is set to 100%. Your
shape layer blocks and hides the content of every layer below. By chang-
ing the blending mode or opacity, you can make your shape layer inter-
act with the layers below in interesting ways. Experiment with different
blending modes to find one that suits your artistic vision. (Blending
modes are covered in more detail in Chapter 10.)
Simulating a multicolor shape layer
Shape layers are typically filled with a single solid color although you can use
a gradient or a pattern. Sometimes, however, you are better served with a
multicolor shape. Take a look at Figure 11-10 and compare the pair of shape
layers to the left with the same shapes to the right.
In addition to the layer styles applied, layer masks hide parts of the more
elaborate pair of shapes on the right. Like the vector path that hides parts of
a shape layer, a layer mask determines what areas of the layer are visible. You
can use layer masks and vector masks together on a single layer, as you can
see for three of the four layers in Figure 11-11.
217

Figure 11-9: A simple layer style makes your
shape jump off the page.

218
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 11-10: Dressing up the shapes can make a world of difference.
Figure 11-11: Layer masks and vector masks work together to determine layer visibility.

Here’s what you’re looking at in the Layers palette of Figure 11-11:
 Layer Shape 1 copy: This is the top layer and would normally hide
everything on the layers below. The layer, as you can tell from the left-
most thumbnail in the Layers palette, is filled with green. The right-most
thumbnail is the vector mask created by the Custom Shape tool. You can
see the shape’s path in that thumbnail. The middle thumbnail is the
layer mask. By painting with black in the layer mask, you can hide parts
of the layer. In this case, the right part of the shape layer is hidden.
 Layer Shape 2 copy: Again, a pair of masks are used together. You can
see that the vector shape is an entire pair of scissors. The middle
thumbnail shows where the layer is hidden by a layer mask, leaving only
the blades of the scissors visible on the gray-filled layer.
 Layer Shape 2: This layer requires only the vector path shape. The gray
layer just above hides what would be black scissors blades.
 Layer Shape 1: The layers above partially hide the red shape layer.
Notice how because of the order of the layers in the Layers palette, the
blades of the scissors appear to be in front of the red part of the object
and behind the green part of the object.
Adding a layer mask to your shape layer is as easy as clicking the Add Layer
Mask button at the bottom of the Layers palette (third button from the left),
and then painting with black to hide, white to show, and gray to partially
hide. You can also make a selection in your image and use the Layer➪Layer
Mask menu commands. You can add layer masks to any layer except those
named Background. (You can’t have transparent areas on a background layer,
but you can rename a background layer to convert it to a regular layer.)
Using Your Pen Tool to Create Paths
Even with all the custom shapes available, you might need to create a path
that is unique to a specific image. For that, Photoshop offers the Pen tool and
its associated tools. Before you start creating paths willy-nilly, you probably
will benefit from a little bit of background information about paths.
Understanding paths
As you click and click-drag, you place anchor points, which connect the path
segments that create your path. Path segments can be straight or curved. You
control those curves not with diet and exercise but rather with direction lines
and their control points. A straight path segment is bordered on either end by
corner anchor points, and a curved path segment is bordered by two smooth
219
Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths

220
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
anchor points or one of each type. 
As you can see in Figure 11-12,
Photoshop helps you differentiate
between path segments and direction
lines by using squares (hollow and
filled) for anchor points and diamond
shapes for control points.
Only smooth anchor points have
direction lines and control points.
The angle and length of the direct-ion
line determine the shape of the curve. When you create a curved path seg-
ment between a corner anchor point and a smooth anchor point, only the
smooth point’s direction lines adjust the curve. When you create a curved
path segment between two smooth anchor points, both points’ direction
lines affect the curve.
Here’s another important way to classify paths in Photoshop — open and
closed:
 An open path has two distinct and visible endpoints; think of it as a
pencil line or piece of string.
 A closed path has no beginning or end — like a circle or an unbroken
rubber band.
When you use a shape tool, you’re creating closed paths. When you click-
click-click with the Pen tool, you create an open path — unless, that is, your
final click is back on the very first anchor point.
Clicking and dragging your way 
down the path of knowledge
All that theory about how paths
work is fine, but you’ll get a better
understanding by playing around
with the Pen tool. Open a new docu-
ment (any size, resolution, and color
mode will do) and select the Pen
tool. On the Options bar, click the
middle of the three buttons to the
left (as shown in Figure 11-13) so
that the tool creates work paths rather than shape layers, and then start
clicking around. Randomly click in various places in the image, adding new
straight path segments as you go.
Figure 11-12: Paths have square anchor points
and diamond-shaped control points.
Figure 11-13: Select the left button to create a
shape layer, the middle button to create a work
path.

Use the middle of the three buttons to the left in the Options bar when you
want to create a path. Use the left-most of the three buttons when you need a
shape layer. The button on the right, for adding pixels to the current layer, is
used only with shape tools.
I’m sure Picasso would be proud, but it’s time to let go of your new artwork
and move on — press Delete (Mac) or Backspace (Windows) twice. The first
time deletes the most recent anchor point; the second time deletes the rest
of the path.
Now, in that same canvas, start click-dragging to create curved path seg-
ments. Watch how the distance and direction in which you drag controls the
segment’s curve. Just because it’s fun, try a click-drag and, with the mouse
button held down, move the mouse around and around in a circle. “Path
Jump Rope!” Press Delete/Backspace twice to delete the path.
Now, to get a feel for how to control your curved path segments, try this:
1. Choose File➪New to open a new document.
2. Choose 800 x 600 from the Presets pop-up menu.
A reasonable size to work with, it should fit on your screen at 100%
zoom.
3. Show the Grid.
Press Ô+’ (apostrophe; Mac) or Ctrl+’ (apostrophe; Windows) to show
the Grid in the image. The Grid makes it easier to control the Pen tool as
you drag. You can also show the Grid with the menu command
View➪Show➪Grid.
4. Select the Pen tool in the Toolbox.
5. Click and click-drag as shown in Figure 11-14.
Don’t worry about precision — you won’t be creating a work of art this
time. Click on the dots; where you see a dashed line, click-drag in that
direction for approximately that distance.
221
Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths

222
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 11-14: You don’t need to be precise; just more or less follow the four patterns.
You’ve just created four of the more useful scallops and curve sets! These
sorts of paths can be used in a variety of ways, including stroking, filling, and
creating selections (all of which I discuss later in this chapter) to create deco-
rative borders and artistic elements in your images.
You should know about a couple of
other features of the Pen tool before
you move on. With the Pen tool
active, take a look at the Options
bar (or look at Figure 11-15, which
shows the Options bar).
When you have the Freeform Pen option selected in the Options Bar, you
click and drag around your image, creating a path as you go. It’s much like
painting with the Brush tool or drawing lines with the Pencil tool — wherever
you drag the tool, the path is created.
Figure 11-15: The Pen tool has a couple of
tricks up its sleeve!

The Freeform Pen offers the
Magnetic option, too. When you
need to make a path (or selection)
around the outside of something of
uniform color in your image, using
the Magnetic option forces the path
to look for and follow edges. Take a
look at Figure 11-16, which shows an
example of an appropriate use for
the Freeform Pen and the Magnetic
option.
A closer look at the 
Paths palette
Paths are saved, duplicated, con-
verted, stroked, filled, and deleted
via the Paths palette (which, like all
palettes, you can show and hide
through the Window menu). You can
even create a path from a selection by using the Paths palette. Without the
Paths palette, your paths have no meaning or future and probably won’t get
into a good college.
Pick a path, any path
The Paths palette can hold as many paths as you could possibly want to add
to your artwork. You can also see the six buttons across the bottom of the
palette that you use to quickly and easily work with your paths. You can clas-
sify paths in the five different ways shown in Figure 11-17. 
You might not use them all, but it’s good to know the five types of paths:
 Clipping path: Clipping paths are used primarily with page layout pro-
grams, such as Adobe PageMaker and QuarkXPress. Much like how a
shape layer’s vector path determines what parts of the layer are visible,
a clipping path identifies what part of the image as a whole is visible.
You won’t need a clipping path when you work with Adobe InDesign —
simply create your image on a transparent background and place that
Photoshop file into an InDesign document. To create a clipping path,
first make your path, give it a name in the Paths palette (to save it), and
then use the Paths palette menu command Clipping Path (as shown in
Figure 11-18).

to create a clipping mask from a path.

 Work path: As you create a path, Photoshop generates a temporary
work path. Unless you save your path, it is deleted as soon as you start
to create another path or when you close the file. To save a work path,
simply double-click the name field in the Paths palette and type a new
name.
 Saved path: Much like working in the Layers palette, you can double-
click the name of any path and rename it in the Paths palette. (You must
rename a work path in order to save the path for later use.) After you
give the path a name, it’s safe from accidental deletion.
 Shape layer path: When a shape layer is active in the Layers palette, its
vector mask path is visible in the Paths palette. If you want to customize
a shape layer’s path, you need to make the layer active first. When a
shape layer path is visible, you can drag it to the New Path button at the
bottom of the palette to create a duplicate. (It’s the second button from
the right.)
 Vector mask: When a regular layer has a vector mask assigned and that
layer is visible in the Layers palette, the layer’s mask path is visible in
the Paths palette.
When creating a clipping path, leave the Flatness field (refer to Figure 11-18)
completely empty unless your print shop specifically instructs you to use a
specific value. The Flatness value overrides the output device’s native setting
for reproducing curves. Using the wrong value can lead to disastrous (and
expensive!) mistakes.
To activate a path in the Paths palette, click it. You can then see (and edit)
the path in the image window. With the exception of shape layer and vector
mask paths, the paths in the Paths palette are independent of any layer. You
could create a path with the Background layer active, and then later use that
path as the basis for some artwork on, for example, Layer 3.
The Paths palette buttons
The six buttons across the bottom of the Paths palette (refer to Figure 11-17)
do more than just simple palette housekeeping. Use them to create artwork
from a path and to convert back and forth between paths and selections.

Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths

226
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 Fill Path: Click a path in the
Paths palette and then use this
button to fill the area inside the
path with the foreground color.
If you fill an open path (a path
with two distinct endpoints),
Photoshop pretends that
there’s a straight path segment
between the endpoints. The fill
is added to the active layer in
the Layers palette. If a shape
layer or a type layer is selected
in the Layers palette, the Fill
Path button is not available.
You can see a filled path in
Figure 11-19.
 Stroke Path: Click a path in the Paths palette and then use this button to
add a band of the foreground color along the course of the path. Most
often, you can think of it as painting the path itself with the Brush tool. If
you have a different brush-using tool active in the Toolbox (Clone
Stamp, Healing Brush, Dodge, Burn, Eraser, and so on), the path is
stroked with that tool. Like a fill, a stroke is added to the currently active
layer in the Layers palette. You can’t stroke a shape layer path. You can,
however, duplicate such a path and stroke the copy on another layer.
Take a look at Figure 11-19 to see how stroking and filling differ.
 Selection from Path: When you have a path selected in the Paths 
palette, you click this button, and voilà! An instant — and very precise —
selection is at your disposal. You can create a selection from any path. If
you want to add feathering to the selection, use the Paths palette menu
command Make Selection rather than clicking the Selection from Path
button.
 Path from Selection: You can create a work path from any selection
simply by clicking this button. If the path isn’t as accurate as you’d like,
or if it’s too complex because it’s trying to follow the corner of every
pixel, use the Paths palette menu command Make Work Path and adjust
the Tolerance setting to suit your needs.
 Create New Path: You use this button primarily to duplicate an existing
path. Drag any path to the button, and a copy is instantly available in
the Paths palette. When you click this button, you’re not creating (or
replacing) a work path but rather starting a new saved path.
 Delete Path: Drag a path to the Delete Path button, or click the path and
then click the button. Either way, the path is eliminated from the palette
and from your artwork.
Figure 11-19: Think about whether you want to
stroke first (left) or fill first (right).

The order in which you stroke and fill a path can make a huge difference in
the appearance of your artwork. The stroke is centered on the path, half
inside and half outside. The fill extends throughout the interior of the path. If
you stroke a path and then add a fill, the fill covers that part of your stroke
that’s inside the path. As you can see in Figure 11-19, that’s not always a bad
thing. (Both paths are visible for comparison purposes — normally only one
path is active at a time.)
Keep in mind that Photoshop doesn’t really create vector objects. If you
stroke or fill a path and then edit the path itself, the stroke and fill don’t move
with the path — they stay right where they are, as pixels on a layer. If you’re
used to working with vectors in Illustrator, this can be a nasty surprise.
Sometimes the easiest and fastest way to create a complex path is to make a
selection and convert the selection to a path. You might, for example, click
once with the Magic Wand, and then click the Selection from Path button at
the bottom of the Paths palette. Remember to rename the path to save it!
Customizing Any Path
Photoshop gives you a lot of control over your paths, not just when creating
them but afterward as well. After a path is created, you can edit the path
itself. While the path is active in the Paths palette, the Edit➪Transform Path
commands are available, giving you control over size, rotation, perspective,
skewing, and even distortion. But there’s also much finer control at your fin-
gertips. You can adjust anchor points, change curved path segments, add or
delete anchor points, and even combine multiple paths into compound paths,
in which one path cuts a hole in another. (Think donut.)
Adding, deleting, and moving anchor points
Photoshop provides you with a number of tools with which to edit paths
although you might never use a couple of them. Consider, for example, the
Add Anchor Point and Delete Anchor Point tools shown in Figure 11-20. Now
take a look at the Option bar’s Auto Add/Delete option. With the Pen tool
active, you automatically switch to the Delete Anchor Point tool when over
an anchor point, and automatically switch to the Add Anchor Point tool 
when the cursor is over a path segment. Smart tool, eh? The Convert 
Point tool, on the other hand, can be invaluable . . . or valuable, at least. Click
a smooth anchor point to convert it to a corner anchor point. Click-drag a
corner anchor point to convert it to a smooth point.
227
Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths

228
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 11-20: Photoshop gives you every tool you need to edit vector paths.
While looking at Figure 11-20, you might have noticed some red highlights.
Okay, they were pretty hard to miss, pretty much on purpose. Although the
Pen tool and the Convert Point tool have specific uses when you’re editing a
path, the true power is in the Direct Selection tool.
Nested in the Toolbox with the Path Selection tool (which you use to select
and drag a path in its entirety), the Direct Selection tool lets you alter individ-
ual path segments, individual anchor points, and even the individual direc-
tion lines that control curved path segments.

When you click an anchor point with the Direct Selection tool, you can drag it
into a new position, altering the shape of the path. If it’s a smooth anchor
point, clicking it with the Direct Selection tool makes the point’s direction
lines visible (as well as those of immediately neighboring smooth anchor
points).
The Direct Selection tool has no user-definable options on the Options bar.
It’s a pretty straightforward, no-nonsense tool that follows a few simple rules
of behavior (which you can see illustrated by pairs of “before” and “after”
paths in Figure 11-21):
 Drag a path segment. Drag a path segment with two corner anchor
points, and you drag those points along with you. If the path segment
has one or two smooth points, you drag the segment (reshaping the
curve), but the anchor points remain firmly in place. Note in Figure 11-21
(upper left) that when you drag a curved path segment, the adjoining
direction lines change length, but they retain their original angles.
Figure 11-21: A number of ways to manipulate path segments and anchor points.
 Drag a corner anchor point. Click a corner anchor point and drag, and
the Direct Selection tool pulls the two adjoining path segments along
with it. As you can see in Figure 11-21 (upper center), the other two
anchor points (and the path segment between them) are unchanged.
 Drag a smooth anchor point. When you drag a smooth anchor point, all
four of the direction lines associated with the path segments on either
side retain both their lengths and their angles. The direction lines don’t
change; only the curved path segments connected at the smooth anchor
point are altered. In Figure 11-21 (upper right), the path continues to
flow smoothly through the anchor point, even as the point moves.
229
Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths

230
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 Drag a smooth point’s direction line. Dragging a direction line changes
the curves on either side of the anchor point so that the path still flows
smoothly through the point. (Remember that you click the control point
at the end of a direction line to drag it.) Figure 11-21 (lower left) illus-
trates how the path segments on either side of the smooth point adjust
as the direction line is changed. However, paths don’t always flow
smoothly through a smooth anchor point — not if you used the follow-
ing trick!
 Option-drag/Alt-drag a direction line. Hold down the Option/Alt key
and drag a smooth anchor point’s direction line, and you’ll break the
flow of the path through that point. With the Option/Alt key, you change
only the path segment on that side of the anchor point, leaving the
adjoining path segment unchanged. In Figure 11-21 (lower right), the
direction line on the left is being dragged without the Option/Alt key. On
the right, adding the modifier key preserves the appearance of the
adjoining path segment.
You can use the Shift key with the Direct Selection tool to ensure that you’re
dragging in a straight line. You can also use the Shift key to select multiple
anchor points before you drag.
Combining paths
As you’ve probably noticed through the course of this chapter, some paths
are very simple (like the paths in the preceding figure), and some paths are
more complex (like the shapes shown earlier in Figure 11-11). Complex paths
are often compound paths: that is, paths that contain two or more paths
(called subpaths) that interact with each other. Think about a pair of circles,
different sizes, centered on top of each other. What if the smaller circle cut a
hole in the middle of the larger circle, creating a wheel (or, depending on how
early you’re reading this, a bagel)? Take a look at Figure 11-22.
There are several ways in which two (or more) paths can interact. Complete
this sentence: “The second path can (fill in the blank) the original path.”
 Add to: The areas within the two subpaths are combined, as if they were
within a single path.
 Subtract from: The second path is used like a cookie cutter to delete an
area from within the first path. (When you need to make a bagel, this is
the option!)
 Intersect with: Only the areas where the two subpaths overlap is
retained.
 Exclude from: All the area within both subpaths is retained except
where the two paths overlap.

Figure 11-22: Two (or more) paths can interact with each other, creating a compound path,
consisting of two or more subpaths.
When any shape tool or the Pen tool is active, the Options bar presents you
with four buttons to determine the behavior of multiple paths. (The first path
that you create will always be just a normal path. The buttons don’t come
into play until you add additional subpaths.) Figure 11-23 shows you the
buttons, tells you which is which, and provides a simple graphic repre-
sentation to demonstrate the interaction. The upper-left path is the original,
with the lower-right path showing how each option controls the interaction
between subpaths.

Figure 11-23: The buttons control how a second path (and any subsequent paths) interact with
your original path.
Tweaking type for a custom font
I want to show you one more little thing you can do with vectors in Photo-
shop, a last bit of fun before this chapter ends. Each individual character in a
font consists of paths. You can convert the type to shape layers (or work
paths) and change the appearance of the individual characters by editing
their paths with the Direct Selection tool.
1. Open a new document in Photoshop.
2. Select 800 x 600 from the Preset menu and then click OK.
3. Select the Horizontal Type tool in the Toolbox and set the font.
From the Options bar, choose Arial, set the font style to Bold, set the
font size to 72, choose Sharp for anti-aliasing, left-align, and click near
the center left of your document.
Okay, in all honesty, you can use just about any settings you want — but
if you use these settings, your image will look a lot like mine.
4. Type the word Billiards in your image.
5. Press Ô+Return/Ctrl+Enter to end the text editing session.

6. Choose Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shape.
This changes the type layer (editable text on its own layer) to a shape
layer (a layer filled with color, with only those areas within the vector
path visible in the artwork).
7. Activate the Direct Selection tool.
8. Edit the shapes of the L’s and the D to simulate billiard cues.
Drag the uppermost anchor points even farther upward to create cue
sticks.
See the result in Figure 11-24.

shapes with the Direct Selection tool.

In This Chapter

I
n artwork and photography, you use shadows and highlights in your
image to produce the illusion of depth. Highlights and shadows lead the
viewer to imagine that a light is falling on parts of a 3-D object. You can also
use a shadow or glow to make it appear that some distance exists
between one object in the image and another object behind it.
Photoshop’s built-in layer styles help you add shadows,
glows, and other effects almost instantly.
In this chapter, I explain how transparent areas on
layers enable lower layers to show through and let
your layer styles appear on those lower layers. You
get a good look at the Styles palette and how you use
it to store and apply layer styles, including your very
own custom styles. I then present the all-important
(for layer styles) Layer Style dialog box and the vari-
ous effects that you can add with it. I also show you
how to save (and protect) your custom layer styles.
What Are Layer Styles?
A layer style comprises one or more effects that surround or are applied to all
the pixels on your layer. Effects that surround pixels include strokes (thin or
thick outlines of color), shadows (just like the one this book is casting right
now on your desk or lap), and glows (outlines of semitransparent color).
Effects that are applied to pixels include overlays of color, patterns, or even

236
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
gradients. But Photoshop offers
even more, including the ever-
popular Bevel and Emboss effect,
which does a great job of giving
the content of your layer a 3-D
look. (And, of course, effects can
be used in combination. Check
out Figure 12-1 for some exam-
ples.) You can add effects to
layers several ways, including
through the Layer Style menu at
the bottom of the Layers palette
(as shown in Figure 12-2). I ex-
plain each of the effects individu-
ally later in this chapter in the
section on creating your own
custom layer styles.
Just so everyone is on the same
sheet of music, when you refer to
a drop shadow or an outer glow
or a color overlay or any of the
other items shown in the menu in
Figure 12-2, call it a layer effect or
simply an effect.
After an effect is applied to a layer
or saved in the Styles palette
(which I discuss a bit later in this
chapter), it becomes a layer style. A layer style
can include one effect or several effects. The
individual layer effects are built 
into Photoshop, but you can add or delete layer
styles and even create your own. By the way,
Blending Options at the top of the list in Figure
12-2 is not actually a layer effect but rather gov-
erns how the colors of the pixels on the
selected layer interact with pixels on layers
below.
Some layer effects, such as drop shadows and
outer glows, appear outside the content of the
layer. For those effects to be visible in your art-
work, the layer must have at least some area of transparent pixels. If the layer
is filled edge to edge, the effect has no place within the image to appear
because the glow or shadow would logically be outside the image’s canvas.
Take a look at a couple of layer style examples in Figure 12-3.
Figure 12-1: Strokes, shadows, overlays, and
bevels are just some of the effects available.
Figure 12-2: One way to add a
layer style is through the Layers
palette.

In both cases, if the layer is com-
pletely filled with color, the shadow
can’t be seen falling on the layer
below. In the sample on the left, you
can imagine that the shadow logi-
cally also appears to the lower right
of the object as a whole, but that’s
outside the image’s canvas, so that
part of the shadow doesn’t appear
in the artwork.
Keep in mind that every layer in
an image has the same number of
pixels — but some of those pixels
can be transparent. When a layer has areas of transparency, layers below in
the image can show through. In the two examples in Figure 12-3, the white
background layer is visible, giving the upper layers’ shadows a place to fall.
(And remember that a layer named Background can’t have areas of trans-
parency. Convert it to a regular layer by double-clicking the layer name in the
Layers palette and renaming it.) Chapter 10 is full of information on working
with layers.
Using the Styles Palette
The Styles palette is, by default, nested
with the Color palette and Swatches
palette. If it’s not there, use the
Window➪Styles command to make it
visible. This palette, which you see with
its menu open in Figure 12-4, is where
you find and store layer styles and is
the easiest way to apply a layer style to
your active layer.
To apply a layer style via the Styles
palette, make the target layer active by
clicking it in the Layers palette; then
click the style that you want to apply.
It’s truly that simple! To remove a layer
style from the active layer, click the left-
most button at the bottom of the Styles
palette. You click the middle button to
save a custom layer style (which I
explain later in this chapter), and you
drag a layer style to the Trash icon on
the right to delete it from the palette.

238
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Take a look at the Styles palette menu, starting from the top and making your
way down to the bottom. The first command lets you know that, like all
palettes, you can add the Styles palette to the Palette Well (at the right end of
the Options bar). You can select the New Style command from the menu to
save a layer style although it’s easier to click the middle button at the bottom
of the palette. (Refer to Figure 12-4.)
Making your way further down the menu, you can choose from five different
ways to view the content of the Styles palette. The Text Only, Small List, and
Large List options might come in handy after you create a bunch of custom
styles with names you recognize, but until you become familiar with the
styles in the palette, their names are pretty much meaningless. The Large
Thumbnail option gives you a better view of the effects in the style, but you
see fewer styles at a time in the palette than you can with the default Small
Thumbnails view.
The Styles palette Preset Manager command opens the same Preset Manager
that you access through the Edit menu. Use the Preset Manager (discussed at
the end of this chapter) to save custom styles in sets on your hard drive to
protect them from accidental loss.
The next four commands in the Styles palette menu are what I call “house-
keeping commands” because you use them to control the content of the
palette:
 Reset Styles: The Reset Styles command returns the content of the
palette to its default. You have the option of adding the selected set to
the current palette content with the Append button or replacing the cur-
rent content with the selected set by clicking OK.
 Load Styles: Use the Load Styles command to add custom styles from
your hard drive (or another location.) You can even purchase prepared
sets of layer styles on CD. The set is added to the current content of the
palette automatically.
 Save Styles: The Save Styles command lets you save the current content
of the palette as a set of styles. All the layer styles in the palette at the
time are saved in the set.
 Replace Styles: Use the Replace Styles command to remove the current
content and then add the selected set.
At the bottom of the Styles palette menu, you find a list of all the layer style
sets saved in Photoshop’s Presets➪Styles folder. Select a set from that list,
and you have the option once again of appending or replacing the current
content of the palette. (The list in your Styles palette menu might differ from
that shown in Figure 12-4.)

Creating Custom Layer Styles
You create a custom layer style by applying one or more layer effects to your
active layer. (Once again, remember that you can’t apply layer effects or layer
styles to a layer named Background.) When you have the effects looking just
the way you want them, you can add that new style to the Styles palette and
even save it for sharing with friends and colleagues. Combining multiple layer
effects lets you create complex and beautiful layer styles that change simple
shapes and text into art.
Exploring the Layer Style menu
In addition to the pop-up menu at the
bottom of the Layers palette (refer
to Figure 12-2), you can apply layer
effects through the Layer➪Layer
Style menu. As you can see in Figure
12-5, a few more commands are on
that menu than in the list of effects
that you find at the bottom of the
Layers palette.
The ten items in the Layer Style menu
below Blending Options are the
actual layer effects. A check mark to
the left of the effect indicates that it’s
currently applied to the active layer.
The Copy Layer Style and Paste Layer
Style commands come in handy, but
if you’re more mouse-oriented than
menu-oriented, you’ll find it easier to
add the style to the Styles palette and
click the style to apply it to other
layers. Clear Layer Style is the equiva-
lent of using the left-most button at
the bottom of the Styles palette — it
removes all layer effects from the
target layer. The four commands at
the bottom of the menu are worthy
of a little special attention:
 Global Light: A number of layer
effects are applied at an angle. Drop shadows, for example, simulate light
coming from a specific angle (which, of course, determines where in
your artwork that shadow falls). You use the Global Light command to
set the default angle at which your effects are applied. Generally speak-
ing, you want the angle to be consistent from effect to effect and from
239
Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
Figure 12-5: You can use the Layer Style menu
to apply layer effects and more.

240
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
layer to layer in your artwork. There are exceptions, however, such as
the situation shown in Figure 12-6. In that artwork, the two type layers
have shadows receding at different angles to simulate a light source
positioned immediately in front of and close to the image. (As you can
read in the next section of this chapter, when you use layer effects that
are applied at an angle, you have the option of using/not using the angle
in Global Light.)
Figure 12-6: Sometimes shadows in your artwork shouldn’t all use the Global Light setting.
 Create Layers: Sometimes you need to edit a layer effect — say, to con-
trol where a drop shadow falls on the lower layers in the image. The
Create Layers command rasterizes each layer effect (adds it to the
image as a separate layer or layers containing pixels). You can then
erase portions of the new layers, apply artistic filters, or otherwise cus-
tomize each effect layer. Remember that after a layer style is rasterized
with this command, you can no longer edit it through the Layer Style
dialog box, but the original style (if you added it to the Styles palette) is
still available.

 Hide All Effects: You can temporarily hide a layer style with the Hide All
Effects command. Alternatively (and more conveniently), you can click
the eyeball icon next to the layer style in the Layers palette to hide the
effects.
 Scale Effects: Use the Scale Effects command to uniformly make the
layer style larger or smaller.
Exploring the Layer Style dialog box
The first step in creating custom layer styles is to become familiar with the
individual layer effects. Each of the ten effects available in the Layer Style
dialog box (see Figure 12-7) has its own set of options. The basic default
values are very good starting points: You might need to change only a color
or perhaps adjust a Size, Distance, or Opacity slider. You can, of course, do
lots and lots of customizing for some of the effects.
In the column to the left in the Layer
Style dialog box, you can mark a
check box to apply the effect, but you
need to click the name of the effect to
open that effect’s options pane. In
Figure 12-7, the check marks show
that this particular layer style
includes a drop shadow, bevel, color
overlay, pattern overlay, and stroke.
The options pane for Bevel and
Emboss is visible, as you can tell by
the highlighting in the left column
(not to mention the subtle Bevel and
Emboss in bold at the top-center of
the dialog box). And in the far right of
the Layer Style dialog box, note the Preview check box (upper right, which
shows what the layer style will look like) and the small sample just below.
That sample shows how your style will look when applied to a square about
150 x 150 pixels.
As you read the descriptions of the various sets of options, keep in mind
some generalities about a few key options that you’ll see a number of times:
 Color Selection: When you see a color swatch — a small rectangle or
square, usually near the Blending Mode option — you can click it to
open the Color Picker and select a different color.
 Noise: When you see the Noise slider, you can add a speckling effect to
help diffuse a glow or shadow.
241
Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
Figure 12-7: The Layer Style dialog box has
separate options for each layer effect.

242
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 Contour: Glows, shadows, and the like can be applied linearly, with a
steady fade from visible to not visible. Or you can elect to have that transi-
tion vary with a nonlinear contour. Generally speaking, nonlinear contours
can be great for bevels, but linear is usually best for shadows and glows.
 Angle/Use Global Light: You can change the angle for several layer
effects by entering a specific angle in the numeric field or by dragging in
the circular Angle controller. If the Use Global Light check box is
marked, you change all the angles for that layer style.
Layer effects basics
In this section, I explain the basics of each of the ten layer effects, showing
the options available the Layer Style dialog box for that effect in an insert, as
well as one or more examples. And don’t forget to take a look at the sidebar,
“The key blending modes.” Later in this chapter, you can read about the
Opacity and the Fill sliders as well as some other advanced blending options.
Drop Shadow
A drop shadow is a great way to separate the content of one layer from the
rest of the image, as you can see by comparing the large and small versions
of the artwork in Figure 12-8. In effect, the content of the target layer is
copied, converted to black, and placed behind your layer. The blending mode
and opacity determine how the shadow interacts with the layers below. You
decide how much to offset and blur the duplicate with the sliders.
(Remember that this is a layer style, so no second layer is actually added to
your image.) You’ll generally want to leave the Contour option of your drop
shadows set to the linear default. Drop shadows are great with type layers!
Figure 12-8: Drop shadows can separate the upper layer from the lower layer.

Inner Shadow
You can do a couple of things with the Inner Shadow layer effect, as you can
see in Figure 12-9. Compare the two sets of options. On the left, a soft, light-
colored inner shadow using the Screen blending mode softens edges. On the
right, a hard inner shadow, using a dark color and the Multiply blending
mode, produces a totally different look. The layer effect is applied to the red
shape on the upper layer.
Figure 12-9: Inner shadows can be soft or hard, light or dark.

Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
The key blending modes
Photoshop offers over two dozen different
blending modes, many of which you see in the
Layer Style dialog box. You really need only a
few on a regular basis although it’s always fun
to experiment with the others, just in case one
of them gives you a cool effect.
The Multiply blending mode generally darkens.
When working with dark shadows or glows,
choose the Multiply blending mode so that the
layer effect darkens (but doesn’t hide completely)
the pixels on the layers below. The Screen blend-
ing modelightens. Use Screen with light glows and
other such effects. The Overlay blending mode is
a mix of Multiply and Screen. When working with
patterns that contain both dark and light colors,
you might opt for Overlay as the blending mode.
Of course you should remember the Normal
blending mode, too! If you want a glow or
shadow to completely block whatever lies
below, choose Normal at 100% opacity. You
might also want to use Normal with a somewhat
lower opacity for a uniform coverage over both
dark and light pixels. And don’t be afraid to
experiment — run through the blending modes
(and opacity settings) to see whether you can’t
tweak that custom style just a little more.

244
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Outer Glow
The Outer Glow layer effect is much like a nondirectional shadow when
applied using a dark color. However, you’ll also find that it has a variety of
uses when used with a light color and the Screen blending mode. As you can
see in Figure 12-10, it has practical uses and whimsical uses. (Please remem-
ber that in real life, stars do not appear between the horns of a crescent
moon!)
In the upper area of the Outer Glow options (Structure), you select the blend-
ing mode and opacity, add noise if desired, and select between a color (click
the swatch to open the Color Picker) or a gradient (click the sample to open
the Gradient Editor). You define the size and fade of the glow in the middle
section (Elements). The Technique pop-up menu offers both Softer and
Precise — try them both. And don’t overlook the options at the bottom
(Quality). Although you use Jitter only with gradients (to add some random-
ness), the Range slider is an excellent way to control the distance at which
your glow is offset. And when you get a chance, play with different contours
for an Outer Glow effect.
Figure 12-10: An Outer Glow layer effect is a multipurpose layer effect.

Inner Glow
The Inner Glow effect offers you the same control as an Outer Glow, with the
impact of an Inner Shadow. As you can see in Figure 12-11, an Inner Glow can
be the base for a neon glow style. (Add an Outer Glow effect, perhaps a
Stroke effect, and there you go!)
Figure 12-11: Inner Glow offers more control than Inner Shadow.
You can also develop some rather amazing styles by using the Inner Glow and
the Inner Shadow in combination. Using similar Size settings and varying the
colors and blending modes let you overlay a pair of effects in combination.
And when you play with Inner Glow and Inner Shadow in combination, don’t
overlook the Contour variations.
Bevel and Emboss
Perhaps the most fun of all the Photoshop layer effects, Bevel and Emboss is
a quick and easy way to add a 3-D look to your artwork. You can apply a
Bevel and Emboss layer effect to text, to buttons for your Web site, and to
create more complex elements in your artwork, examples of which you can
see in Figure 12-12.
245
Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles

246
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 12-12: The Bevel and Emboss layer effect is very versatile.
When you feel the need (and have the time) to let your imagination frolic
through the fertile fields of Photoshop fun, filters are first, but Bevel and
Emboss follows fruitfully. Let me suggest that you take the time to play with
the various settings in the Bevel and Emboss pane of the Layer Style dialog
box to see what they do. Add a new layer, create a simple shape (perhaps
with one of the shape tools), select Bevel and Emboss from the pop-up menu
at the bottom of the Layers palette, and experiment — that’s a far more effi-
cient way to learn this effect than reading technical explanations of each of
the options. (One caveat: You won’t see any change in your layer with the
Stroke Emboss style unless you are also using the Stroke layer effect.)
As you read this book, keep an eye out for the Bevel and Emboss layer effect.
When you come across a bevel or emboss effect, such as those shown in
Figure 12-13, you might want to take a moment to remember your experimen-
tation and think about what settings might have been used.

Figure 12-13: Many illustrations in this book use the Bevel and Emboss layer effect.
Satin
The Satin layer effect uses the shape of the object to produce a wave-like
overlay. As you can see in Figure 12-14, it’s more effective with type and com-
plex shapes than it is with large plain shapes.
Figure 12-14: The Satin layer effect is very effective with complex shapes.

Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles

248
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Color Overlay
The key to using the Color Overlay layer effect is the blending mode. (See the
sidebar, “The key blending modes.”) When you use Normal, in effect, you
paint all the pixels on the layer with the selected color. To blend the color
with the original artwork or other effects (such as pattern overlays), choose
an appropriate blending mode — Multiply with dark colors, Screen with light
colors — or simply experiment with blending modes. However, using the
Color Overlay layer effect with the Normal blending mode in a custom layer
style is a good way to ensure consistency in artwork, such as buttons and
banners for a Web site.
Although you’ll generally find Color Overlay most useful for simple shapes in
artwork and on Web pages, you can certainly use it for more exciting effects,
such as those that you see in Figure 12-15. The original is in the upper left,
and each example shows the color and blending mode selected. Remember
that when you use a layer effect, you can later return and alter or remove
that change from your image.
Figure 12-15: Color Overlay can produce subtle or dramatic changes in your artwork.

Gradient Overlay
Unlike the Gradient Map adjustment (see Chapter 6), which applies a gradi-
ent to your image according to the tonality of the original, the Gradient
Overlay effect simply slaps a gradient over the top of your artwork, using the
blending mode and opacity that you select. You also control the shape of the
gradient, the angle at which it’s applied, and the gradient’s scale (see Figure
12-16).
Figure 12-16: In keeping with its name, the Gradient Overlay effect overlays a gradient.
When working with gradients, you click the triangle to the right of the gradi-
ent sample to open the Gradient palette. You directly click the gradient
sample itself to open the Gradient Editor.
Pattern Overlay
Like the Color Overlay layer effect, Pattern Overlay relies on the blending
mode and opacity settings to determine how the artwork (pattern) that it
overlays interacts with your original artwork. As you see in Figure 12-17, you
can scale the pattern, align it to the upper-left corner of your image (with the
Snap to Origin button), and link the pattern to your layer so that the appear-
ance of your artwork doesn’t change as you drag the layer into position. Click
the triangle to the right of the sample pattern to open the Pattern palette and
then select a pattern.

Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 12-17: The Pattern Overlay layer effect adds texture to your layer’s artwork.
Stroke
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, you’ve seen the Stroke layer effect
for several pages now. Each of the insets from the Layer Style dialog box in
the preceding figures has a one-pixel black Stroke layer effect applied. Adding
that tiny stroke helps set off the dialog box from the background.
You’ll find that not only is Stroke a handy and practical production tool, but
it’s a wonderful creative effect, too, especially when you use it in conjunction
with other layer effects. For example, a stroke of a contrasting color is a great
way to redefine the edge of your object when working with an outer glow and
an inner shadow. (In the Stroke effect’s options, remember that you click the
color swatch to open the Color Picker.) A simple stroke can convert even the
plainest text into an eye-catching statement. And don’t forget that without
the Stroke effect, the Bevel and Emboss effect’s Stroke Emboss option does
nothing for your artwork. Figure 12-18 has a few examples.

Figure 12-18: The Stroke effect can stand alone or be used with other layer effects.
Opacity, fill, and advanced blending
In the Blending Options area of the Layer Style dialog box and the upper-right
corner of the Layers palette, you see a pair of adjustments named Opacity
and Fill, as shown in Figure 12-19. Both have an impact on the visibility of the
content of your layer.
Figure 12-19: The Opacity and Fill sliders control visibility of a layer.
251
Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles

252
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
When you reduce the Opacity setting for the layer, you make the layer con-
tent and any layer style partially or completely transparent. Reducing the Fill
slider changes the opacity of the pixels on the layer but leaves any layer
effects fully visible. When might you want to use the Fill slider? The first thing
that comes to mind is the ever-popular Glass Type technique, which produces
see-through text perfect for your copyright notice on any image:
1. Add some text to an image.
This is a wonderful trick for adding your copyright information to
sample images because everyone can see the image, but no one can use
it without your permission. Start by adding your copyright information
or perhaps the word Sample.
2. Apply a layer style to the type layer.
A bevel, a thin black stroke, and perhaps an inner shadow make an
excellent combination.
3. Reduce the Fill slider to 0%.
You can click and type in the Fill
field, click the arrow to the right
of the field and drag the slider,
or simply click the word Fill and
drag to the left. The type layer
disappears, but the layer effect
remains.
You can see all three steps in
Figure 12-20.
The Blending Options pane of the
Layer Style dialog box offers you a
number of other choices in the
Advanced Blending area, as shown
in Figure 12-21.
Other than the Fill Opacity slider,
you’ll probably never change the
Advanced Blending options from
their default settings, but you may
be curious about what they do.
Here’s a short explanation of each:
 Channels: Clear one or more of
the color check boxes in the Advanced Blending area to hide the layer’s
content in that color channel. Clear the R check box, for example, and
you hide the target layer in the Red channel.
Figure 12-20: Add a type layer, apply a layer
style, and then reduce the Fill setting to 0%.
Figure 12-21: You find Advanced Blending
options in Blending Options of the Layer Style
dialog box.

 Knockout: You can use the content on the target layer to create trans-
parency on lower layers. The top layer becomes transparent as do the
layers below every place that the upper layer had visible pixels. (I think
of it as a “cookie cutter” effect.) If you want to restrict the effect, use the
Shallow option, and the knockout extends only to the lowest layer in
your layer group. The Deep option knocks out to the Background layer
(or to transparency if your image doesn’t have a background layer).
 Blend Interior Effects as Group: You can blend the Inner Glow, Satin,
and your overlay effects before the layer as a whole is blended with
lower layers. Use this option if it seems your layer effect’s blending
mode is being canceled out by the layer’s own blending mode.
 Blend Clipped Layers as Group: If you have layers clipped together (see
Chapter 10), you can elect to use the base layer’s blending mode for all
the layers or let each layer interact independently. You generally want to
leave this check box marked.
 Transparency Shapes Layer: Another option that you’ll almost always
want active, Transparency Shapes Layer restricts the layer style to the
visible pixels on the target layer. If, for example, you’re working with a
small rounded rectangle and a Color Overlay layer effect, clearing the
check box fills the entire layer — not just the rounded rectangle — with
color.
 Layer Mask Hides Effects: If the target layer’s visibility is controlled
with a layer mask (see Chapter 8), you can opt to have the layer style
hidden by the mask, too. You can also use a layer mask to hide just the
layer style with this option — say, for example, when you need to make
sure that your drop shadow doesn’t fall where it shouldn’t. Simply
create a layer mask that hides those areas where you don’t want the
style visible and mark the Layer Mask Hides Effects check box.
 Vector Mask Hides Effects: This option uses a layer’s vector mask in
exactly the same way that the Layer Mask Hides Effects option uses a
layer mask. (Remember that a vector mask is a path that determines
which areas of a layer are visible — see Chapter 11.)
If you’ve got an image with a plain white (or plain black) background, you can
make that background disappear with the Blend If sliders (see Figure 12-22).
In the Layers palette, double-click the layer name Background and rename the
layer. At the bottom of the Layers palette, click the second button from the
right to add a new layer. Move the new layer below the original layer. With
the original layer active, open the Blending Options pane of the Layer Style
dialog box and drag the upper-right Blend If slider control to the left until the
background disappears. As the white background disappears, the checker-
board transparency grid becomes visible. Press Ô+E (Mac)/Ctrl+E (Windows)
to merge the layers and retain the now-transparent background.

Saving Your Layer Styles
Creating custom styles takes some time and effort. Saving the styles means
that you don’t have to spend time re-creating the style again. Save your styles
not only in the Styles palette but also on your hard drive.
Adding styles to the Style palette
After you have your layer style looking just right, you can add it to the Styles
palette. From the Styles palette, you can apply your custom style to any layer
(except, of course, layers named Background) in any image with a single click.
You simply make the target layer active in the Layers palette by clicking it;
then click your custom style in the Styles palette.
To add your style to the
Styles palette, you must
first create it. Select a layer
in the Layers palette, open
the Layer Style dialog box,
and select the layer effects
and options. After clicking
OK in the Layer Style dialog
box, click the middle
button at the bottom of the
Styles palette (see Figure
12-23). Then, in the New
Style dialog box that appears, assign your custom style a name and click OK.
If desired, you can also elect to save the target layer’s blending mode as part
of the layer style.
Figure 12-23: Click the button at the bottom of the Styles
palette to save your custom style.

Preserving your layer styles
Adding your custom styles to the Styles palette makes them available day in
and day out as you work with Photoshop. However, should you ever need to
replace Photoshop’s Preferences file (see Chapter 3) or reinstall the program,
all your custom styles are wiped from the Styles palette. To make sure that
you don’t accidentally lose your custom styles, create and save a set of
styles, which you can then reload into the palette whenever necessary.
The Styles palette menu offers the Save Styles command (refer to Figure
12-4), which lets you save all the styles currently in the palette as a set.
However, for more control — to actually select which styles you want in your
set — use Photoshop’s Preset Manager (see Figure 12-24). You can open the
Preset Manager from either the Styles palette menu or through the Edit
menu. (Make sure that you retain the .asl extension in the filename so that
Photoshop recognizes the file as a set of styles!)
As you can see in Figure 12-24, you
use Preset Manager to save many
kinds of custom bits and pieces. And
use it you should! Shift-click to select
a series of items or Ô-click/Ctrl-click
to select individual items; then click
the Save Set button. Give the set a
name (again, with the .asl file exten-
sion), pick a location, and click OK.
Saving sets of styles, brushes,
custom shapes, and the like in
Photoshop’s Presets folder adds
those sets to the various palettes’
menus. That makes it quite easy to
load the set into the palette: Just
choose the set from the palette menu. However, you should also save a copy
of the set someplace safe, outside the Photoshop folder, so it doesn’t acci-
dentally get deleted when you upgrade or (horror!) reinstall.

n croquis vaut mieux qu’un long discours. Or, as we often paraphrase
Napoleon, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” But sometimes in
your Photoshop artwork, nothing says Bob’s Hardware quite like the very
words Bob’s Hardware. A picture of a hammer and a picture of a nail —
perhaps toss in some nuts and bolts — all are great symbols for your
client’s logo. But you also need to give Bob’s customers a name
and an address so they can actually spend some money,
which goes a long way toward helping Bob pay you.
For a program that’s designed to work with photo-
graphic images, Photoshop has incredibly powerful
text capabilities. Although it’s not a page layout 
program like Adobe InDesign or a word processing
program such as Microsoft Word, Photoshop can
certainly enable you to add lines or even para-
graphs of text to your images.
Photoshop offers you three categories of text:
 Point type is one or more lines of text, comparable
with the headlines in a newspaper or the text that you
add to, say, a Bob’s Hardware advertisement. Click with a
type tool to add point type.
 Paragraph type consists of multiple lines of text. Like in a word process-
ing program, each new line is added whenever your typing reaches the
margin. Drag a type tool to create paragraph type.

258
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 Warp type and type on a path are typically single lines of type that are
bent, curved, or otherwise distorted as a special effect. Use the Option
bar’s Warp Text feature or click with a type tool on a path.
In this chapter, I discuss the tools and palettes that you use to add text to an
image, how to add paragraphs and columns of text (as you might use in a
brochure or booklet), and even how to make your type bend and twist along
paths.
Making a Word Worth a Thousand Pixels
Photoshop offers you four tools, the Options bar, and a pair of palettes
(Character and Paragraph) to control your work with text. By default, the
Character and Paragraph palettes are hidden; because you can make the
major type-related decisions (such as font style and alignment) right from
the Options bar, that’s generally fine. You might need to show the palettes if
you’re doing some fine-tuning of the text appearance. When you do need the
palettes, you can show them by choosing Window➪Character or Window➪
Paragraph, respectively, from the menu bar or (with the Type tool active) by
clicking the Palettes button toward the right end of the Options bar, as shown
in Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1: Photoshop gives you lots of tools for working with text.

Photoshop CS2 adds one of the most requested type-related features in the
history of the program. For the first time, as you can see in the inset to the
lower right in Figure 13-1, Photoshop’s Font menu actually shows a preview
sample of the font styles so that you don’t need to memorize the appearance
of all your various type faces. And you can choose Preferences➪Type to
select from three different sizes for the font preview.
Type can be informative or decorative or both. You can use the type tools to
add paragraphs of text or a single character as an element of your artwork.
The text can be plain and unadorned or elaborately dressed up with layer
styles, such as drop shadows, glows, bevel effects, and other effects that you
apply to make the layer content fancier. However you use it, text can be a
powerful element of both communication and symbolism. Take a look at
Figure 13-2, in which I use the Type tool to add the binary code to the left and
even the musical notes below.
Figure 13-2: You can also use Photoshop’s type as symbolic or decorative elements.

Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
But before you add any text to your artwork, you need to have a good handle
on the various type tools, palettes, menus, and options available to you. I
start with an introduction to Photoshop’s type tools.
A type tool for every season, or reason
Photoshop offers four type tools — or, perhaps more accurately, two pairs of
type tools — that assist you with adding text to your images. The Horizontal
Type tool and the Vertical Type tool (the first pair) create type layers, which
show up as special layers in the Layers palette that enable you to later re-edit
the text that you put there. The Horizontal Type Mask tool and the Vertical
Type Mask tool (the second pair) make selections on the active layer, just as
if you had used the Rectangular Marquee or Lasso tools (as I describe in
Chapter 8).
In addition to that glorious advantage of being able to easily correct acciden-
tal misspellings, creating and using type layers offer a number of other advan-
tages. You can
 Apply layer styles to type layers to fancy them up. For example, try a
simple Inner Bevel or Drop Shadow effect to make the words leap from
the background.
 Adjust type layer blending modes and opacity. Doing this can help you
achieve a unique integration with the artwork’s other elements or 
background.
 Produce extraordinarily crisp and clean type on the page. When print-
ing with a laser printer (or other PostScript device), the text on type
layers prints beautifully.
Until the image is flattened or the type layer is merged or rasterized (con-
verted to pixels), you can change any type attribute, such as the spelling,
font, layer styles, opacity, and blending modes as I show in Figure 13-3.
You automatically gain the advantage of using type layers when you use the
Horizontal Type or Vertical Type tools to add text to your images in
Photoshop. (You can spot a type layer in the Layers palette easily. The layer
shows a T instead of a preview for the layer thumbnail.)
When adding type to your image — whether a simple © Peter Bauer (yeah,
okay, use your own name if you want) or a couple of columns of text to a
brochure — you’ll generally use the Horizontal Type or Vertical Type tools.
But when, you might ask, would you ever need to use the type mask tools?
Perhaps never. If you ever need a selection in the shape of your text, though,
you can manage that trick by adding a type layer and then Ô-clicking (Mac)
or Ctrl-clicking (Windows) the type layer’s thumbnail in the Layers palette.
Voilà! You are presented with a text-shaped selection, and you still have an
editable type layer that you can hide and save, just in case.

Figure 13-3: When you have type layer, you have the flexibility to make changes.
That, of course, doesn’t answer the questions of why you might want a 
text-shaped selection in the first place, why type mask tools even exist, or
why the sky is blue. Although the third question is probably better answered
in a book named Skies For Dummies, here are a number of reasons to use a
type mask tool:
 Stroke: You can stroke a selection, which adds a line of color along the
path of the selection. With a type-shaped selection, this gives you a 
type-shaped line of color. Stroke a selection with the menu command
Edit➪Stroke.
 Fill: You can fill that selection with color, a gradient, or even a pattern
with the Edit➪Fill command.
 Delete: You can delete that selection from an existing area of color, cre-
ating a type-shaped hole in the color or layer. I chopped the words in
Figure 13-4 from the key-shaped sign with a text-shaped selection made
with the Horizontal Type Mask tool.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 13-4: Use type mask tools to quickly and easily make text-shaped selections.
Whether working with type layers or
creating type masks, you have the
option of using either horizontal or
vertical type. The difference between
type that is set vertically and the
more common horizontal type
rotated 90 degrees is illustrated in
Figure 13-5. The figure also shows
that when you add text with a type
mask tool, you see the characters cut
out of a red overlay (top right in
figure); when done, you see the tradi-
tional marching ants selection border
(bottom right). Chapter 8 gives you
more information on working with
selections.
Figure 13-5: Vertical type stacks the individual
characters. You can rotate horizontal type for a
different look.

You can select type options before adding text to the image, or you can
change your options afterward. When you make the type layer active in the
Layers palette — but haven’t yet selected any text in your image — any
changes that you make are applied to all the text on the layer. You can also
click and drag to select some of the text on the layer and make changes to
only those characters or words.
When done adding or editing text, you can end the editing session in any of a
number of ways:
 Click the check mark button (or the Cancel button) on the Options bar.
 Switch to a different tool in the Toolbox.
 On the keyboard, press Ô+Return or Ctrl+Enter.
 Ô+Shift-click or Ctrl+Shift-click to finish that type layer and start a new
type layer.
What are all those options?
Here you are, the proud owner of the world’s state-of-the-art image editor,
and now you’re adding text, setting type, and pecking away on the keyboard.
You’re faced with a lot of variables. Which options are you going to need now
and then? Which ones are you going to need all the time? Which ones can you
ignore altogether? Read on as I introduce you to the various text and type
variables, and toss in a few general guidelines on which options are most
(and least) frequently required.
Take a look at Figure13-6, in which you can see (in all their glory) the most
commonly used text attributes, all of which are available to you from the
Options bar whenever a type tool is active.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
You can change the following text attributes via the Options bar, which is
usually available at the top of your screen:
 Tool Presets: The Tool Presets palette enables you to select a predefined
set of options that you’ve already saved. Say, for example, that you
always use the same appearance for headlines in a recurring project and
a different appearance for the body type. Set each up as a preset, and
then activate all the options with a single click. (See Chapter 3 for more
detailed information on tool presets.)
 Orientation: The Orientation button toggles existing type layers
between horizontal and vertical. Regardless of what type is selected, the
entire type layer is flipped when you click this button. (The button is
grayed out when no type layer is active in the Layers palette.)
 Font menu: Click the triangle to
the right of the Font Family field
to open the Font menu, showing
all your installed fonts in alpha-
betical order. You can also click in
the field itself and use the arrow
keys on your keyboard to switch
fonts. If you select some type with
a type tool first (as shown in
Figure 13-7), using the arrow key
automatically applies the change
to the selected characters. If no
characters are selected, you
change the entire type layer.
 Font Style: When a font has multi-
ple styles built in, you can choose
a variation of the font from the
Font Style menu. Styles include
Regular (or Roman), Bold,
Semibold, Italic, Condensed,
Light, and combinations thereof
(as you see in Figure 13-8). Many
fonts, however, have no built-in
styles.
 Font Size: You can select a font
size by typing a number in the
Font Size field, by clicking the tri-
angle to the right of the field and
selecting a font size from the pop-
up menu that appears, or by click-
ing the icon to the left of the Font
Size field and then dragging left or
right to change the value in the
field. Font size is generally

change or make no selection to change all.
Figure 13-8: Some fonts have many styles
available.

measured in points (1 point = 1⁄72 inch), but you can elect to use pixels or
millimeters. Make the units change in Photoshop’s Preferences (choose
Preferences➪Units & Rulers).
 Anti-Aliasing: Anti-aliasing softens the edges of each character so that it
appears smooth onscreen. As part of this process, anti-aliasing hides the
corners of the individual pixels with which the text is created. When out-
putting to a laser printer or other PostScript device, anti-aliasing isn’t
required. It is, however, critical when printing to an inkjet or when pro-
ducing Web graphics. Generally, the choices here have little difference
among them (other than None, of course). Smooth is a good choice
unless your text begins to look blurry, in which case you should switch
to Crisp. Use the Strong option with very large type when the individual
character width must be preserved.
 Alignment: The three alignment choices on the Options bar determine
how lines of type are positioned relative to each other. The buttons do a
rather eloquent job of expressing themselves, wouldn’t you say? Note:
Don’t confuse the term alignment with justification, which straightens
both the left and right margins (and is selected in the Paragraph
palette).
 Type Color: Click the color swatch on the Options bar to open the Color
Picker and select a type color. You can select a color before adding text,
or you can change the color of the text later. If you start by selecting a
type layer from the Layers palette, you’ll change all the characters on
that layer when you select a new color in the Color Picker. Alternatively,
use a type tool to select one or more characters for a color change, as
you can see in Figure 13-9.
 Warp Text: Warp Text, which I discuss later in this chapter, bends the
line of type according to any number of preset shapes, each of which
can be customized with sliders. (The text in Figure 13-9 uses the Arc
Lower warp style.) Keep in mind, however, that the Warp Text feature is
not available when the Faux Bold style is applied through the Character
palette. (I talk about faux styles later in this chapter.)
Each character in a type layer can have its own attributes. Click and drag
over one or more characters with a type tool and then use the Options bar or
Character palette to change the text attributes. Color, font, style — just about
any attribute can be assigned.
Like many word processing programs, you can select an entire word in
Photoshop by double-clicking (with a type tool) the word. Triple-click to
select the entire sentence. Quadruple-click to select the entire paragraph.
Click fives times very fast to select all the text.

Taking control of your text with palettes
For incredible control over the appearance of your text, use the Character
and Paragraph palettes. In addition to all the text attributes available on the
Options bar, the palettes provide a wide range of choices. With them, you can
customize the general appearance of the text or apply sophisticated typo-
graphic styling.
The Character and Paragraph palettes can be shown and hidden by using the
Palettes button on the Options bar or through Photoshop’s Window menu. By
default, the two palettes are nested together, so choosing Window➪Character
or Window➪Paragraph makes both palettes available.

You can use the Character palette
to edit a single selected character,
a series of selected characters, or
the entire content of a type layer.
Figure 13-10 shows what you face
when “building character” using
this palette.
Unless you’re a fontographer, a
number of the fields in the
Character palette might require
explanation:
 Leading: Leading (pro-
nounced LED-ding — which
refers to the lead [rather than
leed] strips of metal that
typesetters used to place
between lines of type) is the
vertical space between lines
of text. Generally, you’ll leave
Leading set to Auto. However,
you can select one or more
lines of text (select the whole
line) and change the spacing.
Adding more space gives the
text an airy, light appearance. Reducing the leading tightens up the text,
which enables you to fit more lines in the same area.
 Kerning: The space between two characters is determined by the kern-
ing built into a font. You can, however, override that spacing. Click with a
type tool between two letters and then change the setting in the Kerning
field to change the distance between the letters. You might, for example,
want to reduce the kerning between a capital P and a lowercase o to tuck
the second character protectively under the overhang of the taller letter.
This can produce a cleaner and better-connected relationship between
the two characters.
 Scaling: Vertical and horizontal scaling modifies the height and/or width
of the selected character(s). You’ll find this useful primarily for cus-
tomizing short bits of type rather than long chunks of text.
 Baseline Shift: Produce subscript and superscript characters, such as
those used in H2O and e = mc2, with the Baseline Shift field. The
Character palette’s Baseline Shift option is best used in conjunction with
a slight reduction in the font size for the specific character(s).

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 Faux Styles: Use faux styles to apply the appearance of a character
style, even when they’re not built into the font. From the left, as the but-
tons show, the available faux styles are Bold, Italic, All Caps, Small Caps,
Superscript, Subscript, Underline, and Strikethrough. Generally speak-
ing, if a font offers a specific style in the Font Style menu, you’ll use the
font’s built-in style rather than the faux style.
 Dictionary: Photoshop CS2 has almost two-dozen dictionaries built in.
And, wonderfully or confusingly (depending on your personal linguistic
talents), dictionaries can be assigned on a word-by-word (or even character-
by-character) basis. You could, for example, insert a bon mot into the
middle of your text (in the language of your choice), assign the appropri-
ate language dictionary, and not have that phrase trigger an alert when
you run a spell check (Edit➪Check Spelling).
Type warping isn’t available when Faux Bold is applied to any of the selected
characters. As warped as it might sound, that’s the only faux style that inter-
feres with Warp Text.
You’ll probably find yourself using certain sets of options pretty regularly in
Photoshop. Luckily for you, you don’t need to make changes on the Options
bar and Character palette every time you want (for example) Arial Bold, 24
pt, Sharp anti-aliasing, 22 pt leading, and tracking +10. Set up the options
once, and then click the Create New Toolset Preset button in the palette at
the left end of the Options bar, as shown in Figure 13-11. The next time that
you want those specific text attributes, select the preset from that palette,
and you’re ready to type!
Figure 13-11: Tool presets can save you lots of time.

Photoshop’s Paragraph palette is used, not surprisingly, with paragraph type.
The alignment options that you see in the upper left of the Paragraph palette
in Figure 13-12 can be applied to both point type and type on a path, but you
can usually access your alignment options much more easily from the
Options bar.
Figure 13-12: Most of this palette is only for paragraph type.
You’ll see the term type container when I start discussing the Paragraph
palette and paragraph type. Think of it as a rectangular column of text, with
the words flowing from line to line, just as they do when you compose e-mail
or use a word processor. You drag a type tool to create the rectangle, and
then type inside that rectangle. In contrast, when you simply click a type tool
and start typing, you need to press the Return (Mac) or Enter (Windows) key
at the end of each line.
You’ll find specific information about some of these options later in the chap-
ter (when I discuss paragraph type), but here’s a quick look at the other
choices in the Paragraph palette:
 Justification: Unlike alignment, which balances lines of type based on a
point of origin (left, center, or right), justification equalizes both the left
and right margins of a paragraph of type. As you can see by the icons,
the difference among the four options is the last line in the paragraph.
That last line can be aligned left, centered, aligned right, or stretched to
fit from left to right (called full justification).
 Indent Margins: Paragraphs of text can be indented from the left margin
or from the right. Even if you have only a single word selected, the entire
paragraph is indented. Harkening back to that last term paper you wrote
(whenever that might have been), think in terms of a block quote. You
can also use negative numbers in the Indent Margin fields, which
extends the paragraph beyond the margin.

270
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 Indent First Line: You can indent the first line of your paragraphs (or
extend the first line to the left past the margin with a negative value)
without having to press the Tab key. The option can be set before you
start adding text and is applied to each paragraph.
 Space Before/After: When your type container includes multiple para-
graphs, you can specify the distance that’s automatically added between
them. Rather than pressing the Return/Enter key an extra time between
paragraphs, set the spacing in the Paragraph palette.
 Hyphenation: If you’re using justification rather than alignment, I recom-
mend keeping the Hyphenate check box marked. When words at the
ends of lines of justified type are not hyphenated, the spacing within the
lines can get rather messy. If you don’t like the look of hyphens along the
right margin and you don’t like words that wrap from line to line, clear
Hyphenate and don’t justify your text.
Keep in mind that after you drag a type tool to create a type container, you
can have as many paragraphs as fit. When you reach the end of a paragraph,
press Return or Enter. A new paragraph is created within the type container.
Consider the type container to be a column of text, such as you’d see in a
newspaper, magazine, or newsletter.
The palette menus — even more options
Like most of Photoshop’s palettes, clicking the triangle in the upper-right
corner of the Character or Paragraph palette opens the Palette menu, which
holds a cornucopia of options you probably never need to see. (Consider
this: If it truly were a really important option, it would be easier to get to,
wouldn’t it?)
As you can see in Figure 13-13, not 
all menu options are available for 
all fonts. Some of the options are
merely command forms of the
palette menus (such as the faux
styles), and other options are spe-
cific to Japanese fonts. A number of
the options apply only to OpenType
fonts, which include a much larger
selection of glyphs (characters) than
do other fonts.
Here are a couple of palette menu
options with which you should be
familiar:
Figure 13-13: Not all options are used with all
fonts.

 Fractional Widths: When selected, Photoshop uses this option to adjust
the spacing between letters on an individual basis. Will you or I spot the
difference? Not with large type, but if you’re creating small text (espe-
cially for the Web), clear this option. How small is small? Generally 10 pt
or smaller.
 System Layout: Unless you need to match the appearance of text in
Mac’s TextEdit or Windows Notepad, leave this option deselected. When
might you need it? When designing interface items for a program or
game.
 No Break: When working with paragraph type, you can select one or
more words and choose No Break to prevent them from being hyphen-
ated. You might want to do this with words that are difficult to recognize
when split between two lines.
 Roman Hanging Punctuation: Found on the Paragraph palette menu,
this option permits the smaller punctuation marks located at the left and
right margins of justified text to hang out past the margins. When quota-
tion marks and the like are outside the margin, the margin itself has a
cleaner look. Don’t use this option if your layout can’t handle text that
extends past the edges of your column.
 Adobe Composer: This choice is actually quite simple: Single-Line Com-
poser looks at one line of type to determine hyphenation. Every-Line
Composer looks at the entire block of text, generally producing a more
pleasing appearance.
 Reset (palette name): If you’re seeing some strange behavior from your
type tools, you might want to invoke the Reset Character and Reset
Paragraph commands. Each restores the settings in the palette to their
defaults, eliminating any errant setting that might be causing the problem.
Putting a picture in your text
Enough of that heavy stuff for now — time to take a look at one of the coolest
things that you can do with text. Here’s an easy way to create a text-shaped
picture, one that’s fully editable.
1. Using File➪Open, Adobe Bridge, or by double-clicking an image file,
open a photo in Photoshop.
2. If the Layers palette has a layer named Background, double-click the
layer name and rename the layer (as shown in Figure 13-14). If the
image has multiple layers, choose Layer➪Merge Visible from the main
menu.
You want to work with a single regular (not background) layer for this
project. Background layers do not support transparency, and no layers
can be placed below a Background layer.
271

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 13-14: Renaming a background layer converts it to a regular layer.
3. Add your type with the Horizontal Type tool.
4. Click the type layer in the Layers palette and drag it below the image
layer.
5. In the Layers palette, Option-click (Mac) or Alt-click (Windows) on the
line between the two layers.
The two layers are joined together, as shown in Figure 13-15. When you
clip two layers, the lower layer serves as a mask for the upper layer. The
upper layer is visible only where the lower layer has pixels and adopts
the opacity of those lower-layer pixels.
6. Finish the image with a layer style (applied to the lower layer) and
any other artwork that the project requires.
You can click the lower layer in the Layers palette and then click a
favorite layer style in the Styles palette. Or, of course, you can create a
custom layer style by choosing the Layer➪Layer Style command. In
Figure 13-16, you see a stroke, a bevel, and a slight outer glow applied to
the GARDENS layer.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Creating Paragraphs with Type Containers
Although the vast majority of the text that you add to Photoshop artwork is
point type — that is, type that exists on just one or a couple of lines — you’ll
certainly find situations in which you need to use paragraph type in a type
container. The primary advantage of using a type container is word wrap.
While you type, the text automatically starts a new line every time it reaches
the margin.
“Why is that a big deal?” you might ask. “I don’t mind pressing the Return or
Enter key at the end of each line.” Ah, but consider the ever-present (when
you type like me) typographical error! What if the very first sentence of your
manual-Return paragraph is missing a word? To insert that word and main-
tain a visually pleasing right margin, you’d need to go back and redo every
line of type. With paragraph type, the content of each line automatically
adjusts as you insert that forgotten word.
The difference between point type to create a column of type and paragraph
type is comparable with the difference between a typewriter and a word
processor. (If you’re old enough to remember Wite-Out and Liquid Paper,
raise your hand, but not for very long — I don’t want to tire you out.)
Adding a type container is simple. Click and drag with the Horizontal Type
tool (or, in some rare cases, you might want to use the Vertical Type tool),
and then start typing. The type automatically starts the next line as soon as
you press enough keys to reach the far margin. You can keep typing until you
fill the type container. Press Return or Enter whenever you want to start a
new paragraph within your type container.
You can also copy/paste text from a word processing or text editing program.
You can, for example, open a Microsoft Word document in Word, select the
text that you want by clicking and dragging, and then choose Word’s
Edit➪Copy command to place the text into the computer’s memory (on the
Clipboard). Switch to your Photoshop document; select a font, font size, and
other attributes; drag a type container; and then choose Edit➪Paste (or the
comparable keyboard shortcut) to place your text inside the container. When
the text you need already exists, you not only save time by using copy/paste,
but you also eliminate the possibility of introducing typos.
But what if you have more text than fits in the type container? Unlike
Illustrator and InDesign, you can’t link two type containers, enabling the
excess text to automatically move to the next container. Photoshop does,
however, remind you that your text doesn’t fit by showing you a symbol in
the lower-right corner of the type container’s bounding box — the dashed line
surrounding the type container. As you can see in Figure 13-17, the lower-
right anchor point of the bounding box has a plus sign in it.

When you have more text than the type container can hold, you have a
number of options:
 Enlarge the type container. Click one of the bounding box’s anchor
points and drag to increase the size of the type container. Making a type
container a little bit wider often gives you an extra line or two of text at
the bottom.
 Shrink the font. Select the text with a keyboard shortcut (Ô+A/Ctrl+A)
and select a smaller font size on the Options bar.
 Decrease the space between lines. Select the text and decrease the
leading — the amount of space between lines of type — in the Leading
field found in the upper right of the Character palette. By default (the
Auto setting in the Leading field), Photoshop uses an amount equal to
120 percent of the font size. You can often reduce the leading to 1 or 2 pt
larger than the font size before you start overlapping lowercase letters
with descenders (g, j, p, q, and y) and uppercase letters on the line
below.
 Edit the text. Rephrase the text, using fewer words to convey the same
message. If you’re not the author, however, this option might not be
available.

type container.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Selecting alignment or justification
Photoshop gives you several options for controlling the appearance of your
margins. In the “Taking control of your text with palettes” section earlier in
this chapter, I outline a number of options that you can find on the Paragraph
palette menu. But let me go into more detail about a couple of options that
you have when adding paragraph type.
Perhaps the most important decision (other than font and font size) that you
make when preparing paragraph type is a choice of alignment or justification.
When text is aligned left, the left margin is perfectly straight, and the right
margin is ragged, with each line ending where it ends, without any relation-
ship to the lines of type above and below. A column of text that’s aligned right
has a clean right margin and a ragged left margin. If you choose center
aligned, the middle of each line of text is centered. Take a look at Figure 13-18
for a visual comparison.
Figure 13-18: Compare the left and right margins of each column of text. 
Unlike alignment, justification gives you straight margins on both sides of the
column of text. The four justification options at the top of the Paragraph
palette differ only in how they treat the last line of a paragraph. As you can
see from the Paragraph palette buttons, the last line can be independently
aligned left, center, or right; or it can be fully justified, spreading the last line
from margin to margin. You shouldn’t use the fourth option unless that last
line (of every paragraph) is rather full because it looks rather strange when
just a couple of words are stretched edge to edge.

Ready, BREAK! Hyphenating your text
When a word is too long to fit on the current line of text, it can either be
moved to the beginning of the next line (wrapped), or it can be broken into
two parts: one finishing the upper line, and the other starting the next line
(hyphenated).
The hyphenation options are for the truly geeky, my-typography-is-my-life
types. The defaults are excellent and can suffice for all but the most precise
layouts (which you should be doing in InDesign or perhaps Illustrator,
anyway).
If you want to fine-tune how hyphenation is applied (or have far too 
much time on your hands), select Hyphenate from the Paragraph palette
menu to open the options shown in Figure 13-19. The Hyphenation check box
(upper left) activates/deactivates
hyphenation. The top three fields
govern which words to hyphenate
and what limits to place on the
hyphenation. (Think of the second
and third fields as Hyphenate or cram
into the line without hyphenating.) The
lower two fields control the appear-
ance of the opposite margin, limiting
the number of consecutive lines that
can be hyphenated and the maximum
distance from that margin that a
hyphen can be placed.
Shaping Up Your Language with Warp Text and
Type on a Path
You can change the line along which your type flows by using either the Warp
Text feature or by typing on a path. Type warping uses predefined shapes to
which your type is formed (and can be used with both point and paragraph
type), and typing on a path uses a custom path (and is used only with point
type).
Warping type and placing type along a path are great ways to spice up your
message as long as you don’t overdo it and make the message illegible or dis-
tract from the overall appearance of your artwork. Warp Text is a quick and
easy way to bend text, and placing type on a path is a more complex — and
more controlled — technique.
277
Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message

you good results and a pleasing appearance.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Applying the predefined warps
With a type layer active in the Layers palette and a type tool selected, click
the button to the right of the color swatch on the Options bar. That opens the
Warp Text dialog box, as shown in Figure 13-20, in which you choose both the
distortion you want to apply as well as the settings.
Figure 13-20: The illustration uses two separate type layers, each with its own Warp Text
settings.
Photoshop CS2 offers 15 different Warp Text presets, each of which you can
customize by dragging any of three sliders. As you can see in Figure 13-21,
negative numbers can be used, too, reversing the warp. And note that the
Horizontal and Vertical buttons are not available for some of the styles. Warp
Text is one of Photoshop’s truly fun features. The best way to become famil-
iar with it is to open the dialog box and test-drive each of the variations. And
don’t forget to try the Horizontal and Vertical buttons when they’re available!

Figure 13-21: Dragging the sliders back and forth in combination can produce some excellent
results!
Keep in mind, too, that you can set the Bend slider to 0 and adjust the lower
two sliders to create the appearance of depth or perspective for a type layer.
Figure 13-22 shows both horizontal and vertical distortion to create a two-
plane perspective change. And take a look at the Layers palette — when
Warp Text is applied to a layer, the layer thumbnail changes to that feature’s
icon.

Figure 13-22: There’s no formula for warping type. When the preview looks right to you, the
settings are correct.
Customizing the course with paths
You can use the shape tools or the Pen tool to create a custom path along
which you add your text. (You find full information about paths and shape
layers in Chapter 11.) To add type along a path, simply select the Horizontal
Type or Vertical Type tool, click the path, and type. The flow of the type from
the point on the path where you click is determined by the alignment option
that you select from the Options bar or the Paragraph palette. If the text is
left-aligned, characters are added to the right of the point where you click
(called the point of origin for the type). Left alignment is great when adding
type along an open path, such as the upper path in Figure 13-23. You might,
however, want to choose center alignment when adding type along the top of
an arc or circle, so you can click on the top of the arc and not worry about
dragging the type later to center it.

Figure 13-23: Text alignment determines where the text goes from the point where you click on
the path.
If you want type to go in two different directions — say, pointed upward
along both the top and the bottom of a circle — you need to create two sepa-
rate paths and two separate type layers, as shown in Figure 13-24.
281
Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message

282
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 13-24: Sometimes you need to create two separate type layers, using two separate
paths, to achieve your artistic goals.
After you add your type to the path, you can press the Ô/Ctrl key and reposi-
tion the type along the path by dragging. When you press and hold Ô/Ctrl,
the type tool’s cursor changes to an I-beam cursor with a heavy black arrow
on either side, indicating which way you can drag the type. You see the type’s
point of origin as a hollow diamond on the path (not to be confused with the
hollow squares that represent the path’s anchor points). Take a look at Figure
13-25 for a zoomed-in look at the converted cursor and a comparison of the
point of origin diamond and the anchor point square. Note, too, that not only
can you drag type along a path, but you can also drag it across the path, flip-
ping over the type.
After flipping type across a path, you might need to adjust the tracking (the
space between characters), which is the second field from the top on the right
in the Character palette. And don’t be afraid to click in the type and press the
spacebar a few times to adjust the placement of words along the path.

Figure 13-25: When you drag the cursor across the path a short distance, type flips over.
Finding and Adding Fonts
You already have a nice selection of fonts installed on your computer. Some
are installed with the operating system (Windows or Mac), a number of fonts
are installed with Photoshop CS2, and other programs could have tossed
more morsels into the stew. However, you might find that the more you work
with text, the more you crave additional fonts.
Downloading and purchasing fonts
You can find many places on the Web to download free fonts. I must warn
you, though, that some free fonts are problematic and can cause instability.
In addition, don’t download any bitmap fonts, no matter how cool they look.
Always stick with PostScript fonts (True Type, Type1, and OpenType). In a
wholly nonpreferential, alphabetical order, here are a few of my favorite sites
for downloading free fonts.
283
Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message

284
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 www.1001fonts.com
 www.abstractfonts.com
 www.chank.com
 www.fonthead.com
 www.larabiefonts.com
A number of Web sites that don’t specialize in fonts also offer them. Stock
photo sites, clip art sites, and even general graphics-related sites often have
free fonts available. Collections of commercial fonts can be purchased from a
wide variety of sources, including my two favorite font sources:
 www.adobe.com/type
 www.fonts.com
Although having lots of fonts can stretch your options, too many fonts can
lead to slowdowns and other problems. If you do find yourself someday with
a massive collection of fonts, none of which you could bear to part with, use
a font management utility. The Mac OS has the built-in Font Book, and
Extensis (www.extensis.com) offers Suitcase (available online for about
$100) for both platforms.
If you download fonts from a Web site, be aware that the files might be com-
pressed. Compressing a downloadable file does several things:
 Provides for a faster download: The smaller the file, the less time it
takes to travel through cyberspace from the Web server to your 
computer.
 Reduces storage: A compressed file takes up less space on the Web
server’s hard drive — and less space on yours, too! After installing the
font, move the compressed file to a safe place to save as a backup. And
consider burning your special font files to CD for security.
 Allows for secure transmittal: Files that are compressed are less likely
to become corrupted in transit and are also less likely to set off alarm
bells for your antivirus software.
How can you tell whether a file is compressed? Look at the file extension at the
end of the filename. If you see .zip (both platforms) or .sit or .sea (Mac
only), you have a compressed file. Simply double-click the file to launch the
StuffIt (Mac) or WinZip (Windows) utility before attempting to install the font.
Installing (and removing) fonts: Mac
To make a font available to all programs (and to all users in a multi-user envi-
ronment), install it at the system level by copying the font file to the folder
[harddrive].Library.Fonts

It’s a family affair
Generally, folks toss off the term font incorrectly.
To be precise, you should usually use the term
font family. For example, Times is a font family.
Arial is a font family. Myriad Pro is a font family.
Comparatively, Times New Roman Bold 24 pt is a
font, and Minion Pro Semibold Italic 24 pt is a font.
When does it actually matter? Well, you might
want to recognize the difference when shopping
for collections of fonts or perhaps for a laser
printer. One collection (or printer) might adver-
tise 2,500 Fonts! while another offers only 100.
You can be pretty sure that one is referring
to fonts and the other to font families. But
when you’re just chatting, saying font is per-
fectly fine — now that we all understand the 
difference.
To restrict the font to a single user, perhaps for licensing reasons, install the
font into this folder:
[harddrive].Users.[username].Library.Fonts
Quit Photoshop (and any other font-using programs) before installing fonts.
To remove a font, quit all programs that use fonts, go to the appropriate
Fonts folder, and drag the font to the Trash. Why would you ever delete a
font? You might find that the font menu is too crowded, making it difficult to
find the font you need. You might have accidentally installed multiple versions
of a single font. The font itself might not work properly. Or, of course, it might
just be a truly ugly and worthless font that was installed with a collection.
Remember, too, that some programs — our beloved Photoshop CS2 among
them — install fonts into special folders so that they don’t have to share
them with all the other programs. But sharing is nice, don’t you think? You
can move many of the fonts from their secret hiding places into the main
Fonts folder to make them available to all programs. Photoshop installs fonts
into the folder
[harddrive].Library.Application Support.Adobe.Fonts
Do not move the fonts in the folder named Reqrd. (That’s a secret Adobe
code that means required.) If you move those fonts, Photoshop is likely to
become very, very unhappy and not play with you at all.
Installing (and removing) fonts: Windows
Certain fonts should never be moved, copied, deleted, or perhaps even
thought about after the sun goes down. These fonts are critical for the perfor-
mance of the operating system or a specific program. They can generally be
recognized by location (in a hidden folder in Windows, or a folder named
Required) or by an exceptionally cryptic filename with underscores and num-
bers. When in doubt, err on the side of caution.

After you copy or download (and decompress, if necessary) your new font
file, quit all programs that use fonts (including Photoshop). Choose Start➪
Control Panel and then double-click Fonts in the Control Panel window to
access the Fonts dialog box. On the File menu, choose Install New Font. In the
Add Fonts dialog box, shown in Figure 13-26, navigate to and select your new
font file or files, and then click OK. The font is added to the Fonts folder and
made available to all font-using programs.
Figure 13-26: The three selected fonts are copied from their CD to the Fonts 
folder.
To remove one or more fonts, open the Fonts dialog box from the Control
Panel, select the font(s), and choose Delete from the File menu. As when you
add a new font, close all font-using software before deleting fonts.
When you’re in the Fonts folder, take a look at the View menu. Try the List
Fonts by Similarity option. Select a font and watch how Windows rearranges
the content of the font list to show you which fonts are closest in appearance
(and which are extremely different, too). Oh, and by the way, you can double-
click any font in the list to open a preview of the font, which you can print to
create your own font book.

ainting. The word evokes images of brushes and palettes and color being
precisely applied to canvas. Or, perhaps, images of rollers and buckets,
color being slopped on a wall and spread around. It doesn’t generally bring to
mind digital image editing. But painting certainly has a place in your arsenal
of Photoshop skills, even if you never create an image from scratch.
In addition to painting landscapes and portraits (which you certainly
can do in Photoshop, if you have the talent and training), you
use Photoshop’s painting tools for a variety of other tasks.
For example, you can paint to create masks and layer
masks, adjust tonality or sharpness in specific areas,
repair blemishes and other damage in an image —
even to create graphic elements and special effects.
In this chapter, I concentrate on those editing-
related painting skills rather than fine art painting. I
introduce you to the basic concepts of painting in
Photoshop and also walk you through the basic
brush-related tools and the Brushes palette, concen-
trating on those features that you most likely need (as
well as a few of the other, more artistic features). To
wrap up the chapter, I show you how to create custom
brush tips and how to save them for future use.

Part III: Creating“Art“ in Photoshop
Discovering Photoshop’s Painting Tools
Nothing in Photoshop gives you more precise control of color in your image
than using the Pencil tool with a 1-pixel brush. Remember that your image
consists of a whole lot of little colored squares (pixels) and that the color of
those individual squares is what produces the appearance of a tree or a
sunset or even good ol’ Uncle Bob. If you zoom in really close on an image,
you can paint pixel by pixel — you could even create an entire image, one
pixel at a time!
Whether you’re using a tiny brush with the Pencil tool or a larger one with
the Brush tool, adding color to your image with the painting tools enables
you create beautiful or whimsical imagery, such as that shown in Figure 14-1
(with acknowledgment to Picasso’s Woman with Pears).
As you work in Photoshop, however,
you’ll find many very important roles
for the brush-using tools other than
creating imagery. From touching up
dust and scratches in a scan to
removing distant power lines from a
photo to perhaps adding wispy hairs
to soften the outline of a head, you
have lots of reasons to paint in
Photoshop (many of which you can
read about in Chapters 9 and 10).
When you’re capable and confident
using the Brush tool, you might even
find it the best way to make selec-
tions in your image. Selections with
the Brush tool? That’s right — paint-
ing in an alpha channel creates or
refines a saved selection. (You can
read about alpha channels in
Chapter 8.)
You have 17 tools that use brushes
available in Photoshop CS2. Here are
just a few of the things that you can
do with these tools:
 Add color (Brush, Pencil)
 Adjust tonality (Burn, Dodge)
 Sharpen, blur, and smear (Sharpen, Blur, Smudge)
Original artwork ©2005 Peter Bauer
Figure 14-1: Painting with the Brush tool is yet
another way to create in Photoshop.

 Correct color and texture (Healing Brush, Spot Healing Brush, Color
Replacement)
 Copy/paste pixels (Clone Stamp)
In this section, I discuss the primary painting tools and introduce you to
some of the other brush-using tools. (Check Chapter 9 for additional informa-
tion on healing and cloning in your image.)
Painting with the Brush tool
You control where the Brush tool works by selecting a brush tip of a particu-
lar size, shape, and hardness (the fuzziness, or lack thereof, along the edges
of a round brush tip). Remember,
too, that you can use the Brush and
other painting tools to create subtle
changes in existing colors. By select-
ing an appropriate blending mode
and opacity, you can mix the paint-
ing color into the existing colors in
your image. Make these basic deci-
sions from the Options bar, shown
for the Brush tool in Figure 14-2.
As you see in Figure 14-2, the
Options bar gives you access to a
mini-Brushes palette, from which
you can pick a brush tip, change its
size, and adjust the hardness of the
brush’s edges. (Only round brush
tips use the Hardness adjustment.) The five sample lines to the right show
Hardness, from 0% to 100% in 25% increments, all using a 13-pixel brush. The
Brush tool can use any brush tip that you have in the Brushes palette — and,
as you can read later in this chapter, you can customize the brush tip in a
variety of ways.
You’re actually ready to paint in Photoshop already! Select a foreground
color, select the brush size that you want, decide how hard or fuzzy the
edges should be, change the blending mode and opacity (if desired), and
drag the tool in your image. (And, perhaps best of all, no turpentine needed
for cleaning up — just switch tools in the Toolbox.)

painting tool behavior from the Options bar.

Part III: Creating“Art“ in Photoshop
As you work with the brush-using
tools, always remember that the
selected brush tip is applied as a
series of individual impressions, called
instances. Consider an instance to be a
single impression of the brush tip, like
tapping a pen once on a piece of 
paper — it leaves a single dot. Take a
look at the outer borders in Figure
14-3. Changing the brush tip’s Spacing
value (in the main Brushes palette,
found in the Option bar’s Palette Well)
shows how instances appear. In the
upper left, the spacing is set to the
default 25% and a continuous line
results. To the upper right, Spacing is set to 67%, and the individual brush tip
instances are visible as overlapping circles. To the lower left, Spacing is set to
133% — this is a setting that you might use for a dotted or dashed line — and
each brush tip instance is visible individually.
Here’s one other option that you should know about before getting too far
into the discussion of painting tools. In Photoshop’s Preferences➪Display &
Cursors menu, you have a couple of additional ways to show the cursor when
a brush-using tool is active. As in prior versions of Photoshop, you can show
the cursor as the active tool (although you can see that already in the
Toolbox and the Options bar), as a tiny crosshair (for precision), or in the
shape and size of the brush tip. New in Photoshop CS2, you can elect to show
the cursor as Full Size Brush Tip, which uses the same shape and size with
one difference. When you have a round brush tip with a Hardness setting of
less than 100%, this new option uses a circle that encompasses every pixel to
be changed. (The now-named Normal Brush Tip trims the circle back to a
diameter enclosing pixels that will be most affected by the tool.) Here’s one
additional change in the Preferences: You now have the Show Crosshairs in
Brush Tip check box available that adds the precise cursor’s crosshairs in
the middle of the Normal Brush Tip and Full Size Brush Tip cursors. Great for
painting along edges!
If you know you have the cursor set to show the brush tip, but you’re seeing
the tiny little crosshairs instead, check the Caps Lock key on your keyboard.
Caps Lock toggles between precise and brush-size cursors for the brush-
using tools.
When you change the Brush tool’s Opacity setting on the Options bar, you
change the appearance of the stroke as a whole. Changing the Flow setting
(also on the Options bar), on the other hand, changes the amount of color
applied with each instance of the brush tip. When the flow is reduced and the
Figure 14-3: Changing the Spacing makes the
individual brush tip instances visible.

spacing is set to less than 100%, the overlapping area of each brush instance
appears darker (or lighter when painting with, for example, white on black).
Back in Figure 14-3, a Flow of 50% for the stroke with Spacing set to 67%
shows as a series of interlocked, overlapping gray circles, darker where they
overlap. If, on the other hand, Flow were set to 100% and Opacity were set to
50%, you’d see the same stroke as Figure 14-3, just gray rather than black.
One last option for the Brush tool deserves a quick look. To the right of the
Flow field is the Airbrush button. When the Airbrush is on (the button turns
dark), the Flow value takes on more meaning. As you paint with the Brush in
Airbrush mode with a reduced Flow setting, pausing the cursor with the
mouse button down allows color to build up (become more opaque) as if you
were using a real airbrush. You can use the Airbrush both as a traditional air-
brush artist and to simulate spray paint. You can see both in Figure 14-4.
Figure 14-4: Airbrushing and spray painting with the Airbrush option for the Brush tool.
Adding color with the Pencil tool
The Pencil tool differs from the Brush tool in one major respect: Regardless
of the Hardness setting in the Brushes palette, the Pencil tool always uses a
hardness value of 100%. With the Pencil tool active, the Options bar offers
the mini-Brushes palette, choice of blending mode and opacity, and the 
somewhat-misnamed Auto Erase option. When selected, Auto Erase lets you
paint over areas of the current foreground color using the current back-
ground color. Click an area of the foreground color, and the Pencil applies the
background color. Click any color other than the foreground color, and the
Pencil applies the foreground color. But remember, you’re not erasing, just
painting with the background color (even on layers with transparency).
291
Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop

292
Part III: Creating“Art“ in Photoshop
Removing color with the Eraser tool
The third of your primary painting tools is the Eraser. On a layer that sup-
ports transparency, the Eraser tool makes the pixels transparent. On a layer
named Background, the Eraser paints with the background color. On the
Options bar, the Eraser tool offers you the same options as the Brush tool
(including Airbrush) and one more important choice: To the right of the
Airbrush button, you’ll find the Erase to History check box. When selected,
the Eraser tool paints over the pixels like the History Brush (see the sidebar
“Selective Undo: The History Brush”), restoring the pixels to their appear-
ance at the selected state in the History palette.
You have a couple of variations on the Eraser tool tucked away with it in the
Toolbox, too. The Background Eraser tool can, in fact, be used to remove a
background from your image. However, it’s not limited to something in your
image that appears to be a background. Remember that digital images don’t
really have backgrounds and foregrounds or subjects — they just have col-
lections of tiny, colored squares. What does this mean for using the
Background Eraser? You can click and drag on any color in the image to erase
areas of that color. You can also elect to erase only the current background
color and designate the foreground color as protected so that it won’t be
erased even if you drag over it.
The Magic Eraser, like the Magic Wand selection tool (see Chapter 8), isn’t a
brush-using tool, but this is a logical place to tell you about it. Click a color
with the Magic Eraser tool, and that color is erased, either in a contiguous
area or throughout the image. And, like the Magic Wand, you can set the tool
to work on the active layer or all layers, and you can also set a specific level
of sensitivity (Tolerance). Here is the one difference between the two: The
Magic Eraser is, in fact, a painting tool in that you can set an opacity percent-
age, which partially erases the selected pixels.
Picking a color
If you want to apply a specific color to your image with a painting tool, you
have to be able to select that color, right? Photoshop provides you with a
number of ways to select a color:
 Click a saved color swatch in the Swatches palette.
 Enter numeric values or drag sliders in the Color palette.
 Click a color swatch at the bottom of the Toolbox or in the Color
palette to open the Color Picker.
 Select the Eyedropper tool and click any color already in your image.
Heck, click in your image with the Eyedropper tool, hold the mouse
button down, and drag to any color anywhere on your screen — that
color doesn’t even have to be in Photoshop!

293
Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
Selective Undo: The History Brush
Photoshop’s History Brush is a rather interest-
ing tool — think of it as “Undo in a brush.” When
you use the Edit➪Step Backward command or
the oft-employed shortcut Ô+Z (Mac)/
Ctrl+Z (Windows), you reverse everything
you’ve just done. In contrast, Photoshop’s
History Brush lets you paint back areas of your
image to a prior state, leaving the rest of the
image just as it is.
For example, you can help the subject of an
image stand out by blurring the background.
To select a history state to use with the History
Brush — that is, a stage in the image’s develop-
ment to which the tool will restore it — click in
the left column next to that state in the History
palette. (In the figure here, the selected history
state is named Open.) Remember that the
History palette holds only a given number of
states, but you can create a snapshot, stored in
the upper portion of the palette, by clicking the
middle button at the bottom of the History
palette. The snapshots are retained as long as 
the image is open. Note: The snapshots are dis-
One of the simplest of the many ways to do this
is to blur the whole image and then paint back
the subject with the History Brush. In the figure
here, you see the original, all-sharp image in the
upper left. Below that is the image after applying
a two-pixel Gaussian Blur (about which you can
read in Chapter 15). To the right, I use the History
Brush to paint back the original sharp version of
the image for the primary bloom, leaving the rest
of the image blurred.
carded when the image is closed, whether you
save it or not.
If you get a message that the History Brush is not
available, take a look at the History palette. Did
you crop the image or use the Image Size com-
mand? Any change in the actual pixel dimensions
of the image invalidates any prior history states
for the History Brush. No worries! Simply select a
snapshot or history state in the palette that comes
after the change in image size.

294
Part III: Creating“Art“ in Photoshop
In both the Toolbox and the Color palette, the foreground color is shown in
the swatch to the upper left, and the background swatch is partially hidden
behind it. Swap the foreground and background colors by pressing the X key
on your keyboard. Reset them to the default black and white by pressing the
D key.
In Chapter 6, I introduce the Color
palette and the various ways you can
define color with it. Now take a look
at the Color palette’s big brother, the
Color Picker (see Figure 14-5). The
best way to get a feel for the incredi-
ble versatility of the Color Picker is
to open it (click a color swatch at the
bottom of the Toolbox or in the
Color palette) and click each of the
buttons to the left of the numeric
fields. Each option changes how the
Color Picker appears as well as how
it defines color.
The default Color Picker configuration uses the radio button to the left of the
H (Hue) field. It presents you with a vertical rainbow slider (the hue) and a
square area that defines saturation (left-right) and brightness (up-down).
Click or drag in the square area to the left and drag the slider up and down to
pick a color. (Compare the two swatches to the left of the Cancel button to
see the new color above the previously selected color.) If you click the button
to the left of the S field, the slider shows saturation, and hue and brightness
are defined in the square area to the left. Starting to see the pattern? Check
out the configuration for Brightness (B) as well as the RGB and Lab options.
And note that you can type numeric values to define a color as CMYK, but
there are no buttons to the left to reconfigure the Color Picker. Likewise, you
can type in the # (hexadecimal) field below the B field, but you can’t use it to
reconfigure the Color Picker. (Hexadecimal color definition is used with
HyperText Markup Language [HTML] code in Web pages.)
Between the two color swatches in the top center and the buttons to the
right are a pair of little icons that are not always visible. (You can see them in
Figure 14-5 if they’re not currently showing in your Color Picker.) The top
warning triangle tells you that the current color can’t be reproduced within
your working CMYK color profile. Unless you’re preparing artwork for com-
mercial offset press, ignore it — it has nothing to do with your inkjet printer,
for example. If, on the other hand, you are working on a press-destined pro-
ject, click the swatch just below the warning triangle to jump to the nearest
reproducible color.
Figure 14-5: Use Photoshop’s Color Picker to
define colors with precision.

The lower icon, a little cube symbol, lets you know that your current color is
not Web-safe. Web-safe colors are the couple of hundred colors that are
exactly the same in the base color scheme for both Mac and Windows. If visi-
tors to your Web site have their monitors — or PDAs — set to show only 256
colors, everyone sees the same thing with Web-safe colors. Generally, you
can safely ignore the warning because the variation isn’t worth worrying
about. (If you do want to work with Web-safe colors, click the swatch below
the warning cube icon and then mark the Only Web Colors check box in the
lower left.)
Also note the Color Libraries button, known in previous versions of
Photoshop as the Custom button. Clicking that button swaps the Color Picker
for the Color Libraries dialog box (as shown in Figure 14-6), in which you can
select spot colors. Spot colors, which I explain in Chapter 6, are special pre-
mixed inks that can be specially requested when preparing a job for a com-
mercial printing press. Adding a spot color ensures that the color will appear
in the final product exactly as
expected. However, because they
generally require an extra pass
through a press, adding spot colors
increases the cost of your printing.
Spot colors can be used to define
colors for nonpress jobs, but the
color is converted to your working
color mode and printed with a mix-
ture of your regular inks. Return to
the Color Picker from Color Libraries
by clicking the Picker button.
Working with other brush-using tools
Photoshop has a double handful of additional tools that use brushes and the
Brushes palette to make changes to your images. You can see the tools and
their Options bar offerings in Figure 14-7.
These tools aren’t used to paint color in your artwork. Rather, they’re for
fine-tuning details and repairing your images:
 Healing tools: The Healing Brush and Photoshop CS2’s new Spot Healing
Brush are designed to repair texture, like smoothing wrinkles or adding
the appearance of canvas. With the Healing Brush, you designate a
source point — an area from which you want to copy texture — and then
drag over the target area. The Spot Healing Brush, on the other hand,
automatically samples the texture around an area and makes the target
area match its surroundings. Quite cool! (Nested with the Healing Brush
and the Spot Healing Brush are the non-brush Patch tool and Red Eye
tool. With the Patch tool, you use a selection to designate either the
source or destination areas, and then you drag the selection to copy tex-
ture. The Red Eye tool is simply clicked in the red pupil of a subject’s
eye to darken it.)
295
Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
Figure 14-6: Choose custom spot colors in Color
Libraries.

296
Part III: Creating“Art“ in Photoshop
Figure 14-7: Photoshop has almost a dozen additional brush-using tools.
 Color and clone tools: The Color Replacement tool (now nested with
the Brush and Pencil tools rather than the Healing Brush and Patch
tools) replaces the color over which you drag with the foreground color.
Remember that the Color Replacement tool alters only the color, not
luminosity, so painting with black over pink gives you gray rather than
black. From the Options bar, you can set the tool to change luminosity
rather than color to darken or lighten, or choose to match hue or satura-
tion. The Clone Stamp tool, unlike the Color Replacement tool or the
Healing Brush, doesn’t copy an attribute (such as color or texture) but
actually copies pixels. It’s like having copy/paste in a brush. Option/Alt-
click a source area and then drag where you want to copy those pixels.
Powerful! The Pattern Stamp tool paints with a selected pattern, using the
blending mode and opacity that you designate in the Options bar. The
Pattern Stamp tool is sometimes a good way to add texture selectively.
 Toning tools: The Dodge tool lightens, the Burn tool darkens — and if
you use the defaults, they do it too much! When using these tools to
adjust luminosity in your image, it’s best to start with an Exposure set-
ting of about 12% and paint carefully, perhaps repeatedly, rather than
making a huge change with Exposure set to 50%. You’ll find the Sponge
tool nested with the Dodge and Burn tools. Use it to either increase or
decrease saturation as you drag. (Decreasing saturation with the Sponge
tool is a great way to create an image that’s partially grayscale.)

 Focus tools: The Blur and Sharpen tools do just what their names say.
Like the toning tools, you might find the 50% Strength default to be way
too powerful for most jobs. Selective sharpening can help bring out
details and direct attention in an image. Likewise, selective blurring can
hide minor defects and help direct the viewer’s eye toward areas of
sharpness in the image. You can use the Luminosity blending mode with
the Blur and Sharpen tools to minimize unwanted color artifacts while
blurring or sharpening. Tucked in with the focus tools is the Smudge
tool. Click and drag to smear pixels along the path. (I find the Smudge
tool especially useful for dragging out wispy hairs from heads that
appear perhaps too well-defined.)
Filling, stroking, and dumping to add color
You have several more ways to add color to your artwork, all techniques that
don’t use brushes at all. You can, for example, make a selection and fill the
selection with color via the Edit➪Fill command, or you can add a band of
color along the edge of the selection with the Edit➪Stroke command (using
the dialog boxes shown to the right in Figure 14-8). You can also “dump”
color into your image with the Paint Bucket tool (nested below the Gradient
tool in the Toolbox). Use the Paint Bucket to fill an empty selection with color
or to replace the color on which you click with the foreground color.
Figure 14-8: Photoshop offers several non-brush ways to add color to your images.

Part III: Creating“Art“ in Photoshop
Don’t forget shape layers, either! They’re a great way to add perfectly defined
areas of solid color to an image. (You can read about working with shape
layers in Chapter 11.)
Using gradients
You can add gradients, which are subtle blends of color, quite easily to your
artwork:
1. Make a selection.
Unless you make a selection first, the gradient fills your entire layer. If
you want the gradient to fill the entire layer, don’t make a selection first.
2. Select the Gradient tool.
Click the Gradient tool in the Toolbox. If you don’t see it, look for it
nested with the Paint Bucket tool.
3. Select a gradient.
You can open the Gradient palette by clicking the triangle to the right of
the sample gradient on the Options bar (see Figure 14-9). You can also
click the sample gradient directly to open the Gradient Editor.
4. Choose a shape.
The five buttons to the right of the sample gradient on the Options bar
show you the shapes available for the Gradient tool. (From the left, the
buttons are Linear, Radial, Angle, Reflected, and Diamond.)
5. Choose additional options.
You can pick a blending mode and opacity, flip the colors in the gradient
with the Reverse option, choose Dither to help disguise the transitions
between colors, and mark the Transparency check box to preserve any
transparent areas on your layer.
6. Drag the Gradient tool.
Where you start and in which direction you drag ultimately determine
the appearance of the gradient.
The background gradient in Figure 14-9 uses the Angle Gradient option on the
Options bar and the custom gradient that you see in the Gradient Editor.
Notice in the Gradient Editor the opacity stops (above the sample being con-
structed) and color stops (below the sample). The stops — the squares with
points positioned along the sample gradient — determine the color or opac-
ity of the gradient at that particular point. By default, there’s a smooth and
even blend between neighboring stops, but you can adjust the blend by drag-
ging the small diamonds you see on either side of the opacity and color
stops. (Hint: The active stops use filled triangles instead of hollow triangles
with their little squares.)

Figure 14-9: Control gradients with the Options bar, Gradient palette, and Gradient Editor.
Click anywhere along the top (opacity) or bottom (color) of the gradient to
add a new stop. Drag stops to move them. Option/Alt-drag a stop to duplicate
it. Change the attributes of the selected stop with the options just below in
the Gradient Editor.
After designing your new gradient, remember to click the New button to add
it to the Gradient palette. But keep in mind that custom gradients aren’t
really saved until you use the Save button or the Preset Manager to create
sets on your hard drive. If you don’t save your custom gradients, they’ll be
gone if you need to reset Photoshop’s Preferences file (see Chapter 3).
Browsing the Brushes Palette
Photoshop’s Brushes palette provides a bewildering array of options, sure to
confuse even the most diligent explorer. Thankfully, unless you intend to
create fine art paintings digitally, you can safely ignore a whole bunch of
options.

You must have a brush-using tool active to access the Brushes palette. If the
active tool doesn’t use brushes, the entire palette is grayed out and unavail-
able. If that’s the case, simply press B on the keyboard to activate the Brush
tool.
An overview of options
The Brushes palette, like the Layer Style dialog box, has a column on the left
that lists options. Like the Layer Style dialog box, you mark the check box to
activate the feature, but you have to
click the name to open that pane in
the palette. As you can see in Figure
14-10, the Brushes palette menu
offers a pretty normal selection of
commands, including the variations
in how to display the palette content,
some housekeeping commands for
resetting/loading/saving brushes, and
a list of brush sets at the bottom of
the menu.
And don’t overlook those little lock
icons to the right of the various pane
names. Click the lock to preserve 
the settings in that pane while you
switch among brush tip presets. 
Any unlocked attributes revert to
those with which the brush tip was
created. Locking, for example, Shape
Dynamics retains those settings even
if you switch to a totally different
brush tip.
Here, in order, are the panes and the options in those panes to which you
should pay attention:
 Brush Presets: Here’s where you pick the basic brush tip shape from the
brushes loaded in the palette. You can also resize the brush tip, but
that’s it. Note the lack of a check box in Figure 14-10. You don’t acti-
vate/deactivate Brush Presets; you just pick a brush tip and size and
then move on.
 Brush Tip Shape: Also without a check box, Brush Tip Shape is the pane
in which you customize the selected brush tip. (Refer to the Brush Tip
Shape pane in Figure 14-3.) This is perhaps the most important part of
the Brushes palette. In this pane, you can select a brush tip, change its
size, alter the angle at which it’s applied, change the height-width rela-
tionship (Roundness) of the tip, and adjust the Spacing setting.
Figure 14-10: The Brushes palette and its 
menu — quite a handful!

 Shape Dynamics: Dynamics in the Brushes palette add variation as you
drag a tool. Say you’re working with a round brush tip and choose Size
Jitter. As you drag the brush tip, the brush tip instances (the individual
marks left by the brush as you drag) will vary in diameter. The Shape
Dynamics pane offers Size Jitter, Angle Jitter, and Roundness Jitter. Each
of the “jitters” can be set to fade after a certain number of brush tip
instances or can be controlled with the stylus that you use with a
Wacom tablet. Angle can also be set to Direction, which forces the brush
tip to adjust the direction that you drag or the direction of the selection
or path you stroke. Use Shape Dynamics to add some variation and ran-
domness to your painting, as shown in Figure 14-11.
Figure 14-11: Use jitter to add variation to the application of your selected brush tip.
 Scattering: Scattering varies the number of brush tip instances as you
drag as well as their placement along the path you drag. Like the shape
dynamics, scattering can be set to fade or can be controlled with a
Wacom tablet.
 Texture: Use the Texture pane to add a pattern to the brush tip. (It uses
the same patterns that you use to fill a selection.) Texture is most evi-
dent when Spacing for the brush tip is set to at least 50%.

 Dual Brush: Using a blending mode you select, the Dual Brush option
overlays a second brush tip. You could, for example, add an irregular
scatter brush to a round brush tip to break up the outline as you paint.
 Color Dynamics: Using the Color Dynamics pane, you can vary the color
of your stroke as you drag. This comes in most handy for painting
images and scenes rather than, say, working on an alpha channel. Just as
you might add jitter to the size, shape, and placement of a grass brush
while creating a meadow, you might also want to add some differences
in color as you drag. You could pick different shades of green for the
foreground and background colors and then also add jitter to the hue,
saturation, and brightness values as the foreground and background
colors are mixed while you drag.
 Other Dynamics: Think of this pane as Opacity and Flow Jitter. You can
add variation to the opacity and flow settings from the Options bar as
you drag.
 Other Options: At the bottom of the left column are five brush options
that don’t have separate panes in the Brushes palette. They’re take-it-or-
leave-it options — either activated or not.
• Noise: Adding Noise to the brush stroke helps produce some tex-
ture and breaks up solid areas of color in your stroke.
• Wet Edges: Wet Edges simulates paint building up along the edges
of your stroke.
• Airbrush: The Airbrush check box simply duplicates the button on
the Options bar.
• Smoothing: Smoothing helps reduce sharp angles as you drag your
mouse or stylus. If the stroke you’re painting should indeed have
jagged turns and angles, disable Smoothing.
• Protect Texture: The Protect Texture option ensures that all the
brushes with a defined texture use the same texture. Use this
option when you want to simulate painting on canvas, for example.
When creating a dashed line or stroking a path with a non-round brush tip, go
to the Shape Dynamics pane of the Brushes palette and set the Angle Jitter’s
Control pop-up menu to Direction. That enables the brush tip to rotate as
necessary to follow the twists and turns of the selection or path that it’s
stroking. (You’ll generally want to leave Angle Jitter set to 0% so that the
stroke follows the selection or path precisely.)

Creating and saving custom brush tips
You can use any artwork as a custom
brush tip — you can even make a
brush tip from your own face! With
the artwork on a transparent or white
background (you don’t even need to
make a selection), use the Edit➪
Define Brush Preset command. Type
a name (see Figure 14-12) and click
OK. Your new custom brush is added
to the Brushes palette. After you
define a piece of artwork as a brush,
you can add that image to any project
with a single click or drag.
As soon as you define your custom
brush, open the Brushes palette,
select the new brush, and set Spacing
and any other options that you’ll gen-
erally want to use with the new
brush. Then from the Brushes palette
menu, choose the New Brush Preset
command and resave your custom
brush. Now when you select your
custom brush, you have your preferred settings all ready to go!
Keep in mind these things when creating custom brushes:
 All brushes are grayscale. Regardless of the color in the artwork that
you use to create your new brush, the brush itself is saved as a
grayscale representation of the art.
 Only one color is painted. Again, the brush is grayscale: It applies the
foreground color in tints to match the grays in the brush tip (unless, of
course, you use the Color Dynamics option in the Brushes palette).
 Your art might need more contrast. You might want to convert a copy
of your original to grayscale to see whether it wouldn’t benefit from a
Levels adjustment to boost the contrast. Higher contrast often makes for
better brush tips.
 Remember to save your custom brushes! Once again (and you’ll proba-
bly read this reminder a few more times elsewhere in this book), your
custom brushes aren’t really saved until you use the Brushes palette
menu command Save Brushes (to make a new set of all the brushes cur-
rently in the palette) or Edit➪Preset Manager (to make a new set of only
the brushes you select).

Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
In This Chapter
 Being productive with “fix it” filters
 Getting artsy with creative filters
 Adding wackiness (and precise correction) with Liquify
 Taking a quick look at the specialized filters
T
he Photoshop CS2 Filter menu includes over 100 commands that you can
use to fix, flatter, finesse, and freak out your photos. You can use most of
the filters on most of your artwork and some of the filters on some of your
artwork, and you probably won’t ever use a number of the filters.
In this chapter, I start you off with a look at what I call the “production” 
filters: namely, the key filters you use to improve or repair your
images. Next, I show you the basics of two of the most fun fea-
tures in all of Photoshop: the Filter Gallery and Liquify. Not
only are they fun, but you can use them to do wondrous
things to your artwork. I wrap up the chapter with a
look at several other key filters.
The Filters You Really Need
Photoshop has a number of filters that you can use
on just about any image to improve or finesse it.
Most photos, for example, benefit from at least a little
bit of sharpening to improve the detail in the image. In
some cases, you want to decrease the visible detail in an
image in areas to hide defects, or perhaps you blur a back-
ground to draw more attention to the subject of your shot. And
Photoshop CS2 has a couple of new filters that you’ll find handy for 
correcting lens distortion and reducing noise (specks of red, green, and 
blue) in digital photos.

306
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Some filters aren’t available for images in CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/black)
color mode, and some aren’t available when you’re working in 16-bit color. All
the filters are available for 8-bit RGB and grayscale images. (No filters are
available for GIF or PNG-8 images, which use Indexed Color mode.) And keep
in mind that you can apply filters to specific areas of an image by making a
selection first. (See Chapter 8 for info on selections and masks.)
You can instantly reapply the last used filter exactly as it was applied with
the keyboard shortcut Ô+F (Mac)/Ctrl+F (Windows). If you’d like to reopen
that last-used filter’s dialog box to change settings before reapplying, press
Option+Ô+F/Alt+Ctrl+F.
Sharpening to focus the eye
When looking at an image, the eye is naturally drawn to certain areas first.
You generally look at bright areas before dark areas and areas of detail before
smoother areas in the image. Compare, for example, the three photos in Figure
15-1 (which were taken using different focal lengths and lens apertures). Using
Photoshop’s sharpen filters enables you to improve the detail throughout your
image or in specific areas to which you want to draw attention.
Figure 15-1: Blurry backgrounds help the subject stand out.
Photoshop offers five sharpen filters, three of which you can ignore. The
Sharpen, Sharpen More, and Sharpen Edges filters have no user-definable set-
tings and simply work in accordance with their names. Sure, they do a good
job, but you don’t have that all-important control over your images! Skip
them in favor of the it-takes-some-work-but-it’s-worth-it sharpening filters:
Unsharp Mask and the new Smart Sharpen.

Unsharp Mask
The Unsharp Mask filter is, indeed, a sharpening filter, despite the name
(which comes from the blurry — unsharp — mask created from a copy of the
image and used in the sharpening). As you can see in Figure 15-2, Unsharp
Mask offers three sliders to adjust the appearance of your image.
Figure 15-2: Despite its name, Unsharp Mask actually sharpens your image.
In the upper left, you see the original image at 100% zoom. The middle image
shows the sharpening at 100% zoom. To the right is a 300% zoom in the pre-
view area of Unsharp Mask’s dialog box.
Always evaluate your filters at 100% zoom even if you need to shrink the
window to only a critical portion of the artwork. Zoomed in or zoomed out
views might not accurately reflect the changes that you’re making because
the image isn’t displayed with one screen pixel representing one image pixel.
You can, of course, open a second view of the same image with the
Window➪Arrange➪New Window for [filename] command.
Unsharp Mask works by identifying lines of strong contrast — the edges of
elements within your image — and increases the contrast along those edges.
Along the border of a dark area and a light area, Unsharp Mask uses a thin
band of light and a thin band of dark to create a light and dark halo along the
edges. That makes the edge appear much more defined. Here’s how Unsharp
Mask’s sliders (as shown in Figure 15-3) work to control the effect.
307
Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop

308
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 Amount: The Amount slider determines
how much sharpening is actually applied
by controlling the brightness and darkness
of the halo. An amount of 50% is often suit-
able for small images that are already in
pretty good shape. Use 100% for general
photos. Use larger values, up to 500%, for
special effects.
 Radius: Use the Radius slider to determine
the width of the halo. You’ll typically need a
value as low as 1 pixel for small images and 
perhaps as high as 7 for larger images that don’t have a lot of tiny detail.
 Threshold: The Threshold slider helps you avoid destroying your image
by over-sharpening fine details. If the tiniest details in the image get
wide, bright halos, they can look garish and unnatural. The higher the
Threshold setting, the larger an area must be before sharpening is
applied. Typical Threshold settings are 2 for a small image and 5 or 7 for
a large image.
The new Photoshop CS2 Smart Sharpen filter provides you with an incredible
amount of control over the sharpening process. Although it won’t (quite) be
able to give you a crisp image of that bank robber from the pixelated, blurry
surveillance camera (that only happens on TV), it will help you improve just
about any image. Those who photograph through microscopes and tele-
scopes might find this filter particularly useful. However, remember that
although you might improve an image, some blurs won’t be removed by
sharpening.
Figure 15-4 shows how well Smart Sharpen works with an appropriate image.
In this image, the blurring is consistent throughout the subject of the shot,
and there is a reasonable amount of blur. Note in Figure 15-4 that when you
select the Advanced radio button, you get a pair of new tabs in the dialog
box: namely, Shadow and Highlight. Use those tabs to control how strongly
the effect is applied in the darker and lighter parts of the tonal range.
Smart Sharpen also enables you to specify any of three types of blurring that
can be plaguing your image: Gaussian Blur (a uniform blur), Lens Blur (areas
of blur beyond the focal distance of the lens), and Motion Blur (the subject or
camera moving while the shot was taken). If you don’t see distinct evidence
of lens blur or motion blur, stick with Gaussian blur.
Figure 15-3: You adjust three
sliders when sharpening with
Unsharp Mask.

Figure 15-4: Smart Sharpen does a great job with appropriate images.
309
Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
The Edit➪Fade command
Immediately after applying just about any filter or adjustment command, and after using many of
Photoshop’s tools, you can adjust the effect with the Fade command, found under the Edit menu.
(Keep in mind that Fade is available only immediately after using a filter, adjustment, or tool. You
can’t even use the Save command in between.)
 With Fade, you can reduce the opacity of the previous command or tool, thus reducing its
impact on your image. You can also change the blending mode, which alters how the command
or tool interacts with pixel colors prior to your change.
Say, for example, you paint a black stroke with the Brush tool set to Normal and 100% opacity.
Immediately afterward, you go to the Edit menu and select the Fade Brush command. You can
then pick a new blending mode and/or reduce the opacity setting, which changes the painted
stroke to appear as if you’d selected the new
settings in the Options bar before painting.
 You can also apply the Unsharp Mask filter and
then select the Edit➪Fade Unsharp Mask com-
mand, as shown in the figure here. (Yes, the Fade
command changes names automatically!) In the
Fade dialog box, changing the blending mode from
Normal to Luminosity ensures that your Unsharp
Mask filter doesn’t alter the color of pixels along
edges. Using the Fade command this way is the
same as if you’d switched to Lab color mode
and sharpened only the L channel — without
having to switch color modes at all.

310
Part III: Creating“Art“ in Photoshop
Blurring images or selections
As you can see in Figure 15-1, blurred areas in an image attract less attention
than do the sharper parts of the photo. By making a selection, you can selec-
tively apply Photoshop’s blur filters. You can also use the blur filters to hide
flaws in an image, including dust, noise, and unwanted little bits and pieces in
the picture. You might also want to blur all or part of an image prior to using
some of the artistic filters available in the Filter Gallery (which I discuss later
in this chapter).
Photoshop CS2 provides you with almost a dozen different blur filters, includ-
ing three brand new blur filters. Although you’ll eventually develop a special
fondness for one or two blur filters, it’s good to know how each of them
works. Table 15-1 gives a quick overview of the available filters.

Using the Lens Correction filter
The new Photoshop CS2 Lens Correction filter (find it in the Distort filters)
does a wonderful job of cleaning up pin cushioning and barrel distortion (the
outer edges of your image appear to bend inward or outward, respectively).
You’ll see pin cushioning when shooting with a telephoto lens at its max
zoom and barrel distortion at the lens’s lower magnification. Both are most
obvious when the photo has what should be straight lines at the edges. You
can also use Lens Correction to adjust the vertical or horizontal plane of an
image. In Figure 15-7, you see the Lens Correction window, a rather complex
working environment.
Figure 15-7: Fix barrel distortion, pin cushioning, and perspective with Lens Correction.
Here’s what you have at your disposal in the Lens Correction window:
In the upper-left corner of the window are five tools:
 Remove Distortion (top): Select this tool to drag in the preview area to
adjust the distortion factor.
 Straighten (second): This tool is simple: Click and drag along any line in
the image that should be straight, and the image is straightened!
313
Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop

314
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 Drag Grid (middle): Use this to reposition the grid overlay, aligning it
with the content of your image.
 Hand and Zoom: The lower pair of tools should look familiar. The Hand
and Zoom tools function as they do anywhere in Photoshop: When the
image doesn’t fit in the window, click and drag with the Hand tool to
reposition; click the Zoom tool to zoom in, Option/Alt-click to zoom out.
You’ll also find
 Remove Distortion slider: The Remove Distortion slider is the heart of
this filter. You use this to compensate for pin cushioning or barrel distor-
tion in the image. Drag it back and forth until your image’s vertical and
horizontal lines are straight throughout the image.
 Chromatic Aberration sliders: Sometimes a photograph shows dis-
torted color along fine angular lines, such as the branches of trees or lat-
ticework. You can minimize these colored halos or fringes with the
Chromatic Aberration sliders. Generally speaking, you want to zoom in
close on a specific area of detail to make the adjustment.
 Vignette sliders: Drag the Amount slider to the left to add a dark vignette
(fading along the outer edges of the image) or to the right for a white
vignette. The Midpoint slider increases and decreases the amount of
shadowing or highlight along the edges.
 Transform controls: Use the Vertical Perspective and Horizontal
Perspective sliders to make your image appear parallel to the viewer.
Much like using the perspective crop option or the Edit➪Transform➪
Perspective command, you’re changing the perceived angle of the image
to the viewer.
 Zoom and grid: Click the minus and plus buttons in the lower-left corner
to zoom out and in, or choose a preset zoom factor from the pop-up
menu. Click and drag on the Size field’s label (the actual word Size) to
resize the grid. Click the color swatch to change the color from the
default gray. (I liked bright yellow for the image in Figure 15-7.)
 Saving and loading settings: From the Lens Correction window’s menu
(to the right of the Settings pop-up menu), you can save (and later load)
settings. Because you can name the settings, you can save a set for each
of your lenses, at each of their zoom factors, and apply the same correc-
tion easily, time after time.
Although Lens Correction is designed to fix images, there is no reason why
you couldn’t use it for special effects. For example, rather than using the
Perspective command, you can use the Vertical Perspective and Horizontal
Perspective sliders in Lens Correction, and perhaps add some barrel distor-
tion as you would with the Distort➪Pinch filter.

Cleaning up with Reduce Noise
Digital noise — those annoying red, green, and blue specks in your image —
can ruin an otherwise lovely picture. (To avoid noise, make sure that your
camera is set to shoot at the lowest ISO setting possible.) Photoshop CS2
adds a new filter for reducing (not necessarily eliminating) digital noise in
your images. Found under the Filter➪Noise menu, Reduce Noise can do an
excellent job of minimizing the random red, green, and blue pixels in your
image, as you can see in Figure 15-8.
Figure 15-8: Reduce Noise neutralizes the red, green, and blue specks in a digital image.
When you work with Raw images, do all your noise correction in the Camera
Raw plug-in (see Chapter 7). For images in formats other than Raw, use the
Reduce Noise filter.
Here are the steps that I recommend when you use the Reduce Noise filter:
1. Set the details sliders to 0 (zero).
In the Reduce Noise dialog box, drag the Preserve Details and Sharpen
Details sliders all the way to the left. This eliminates any interference
with the actual noise reduction.
315
Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop

316
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
2. Reduce Color Noise.
Use the Reduce Color Noise slider to minimize the red, green, and blue
specks in your image. Drag the slider slowly to the right until the color
noise is gone.
3. Adjust Sharpen Details.
Increase the Sharpen Details slider 1% at a time until the color noise
returns; then back off 1%.
4. Adjust Preserve Details.
Drag the Preserve Details slider to the right until you have a good bal-
ance between image detail and any luminance noise (bright and dark
specks) in the image. In Figure 15-8, the distant trees are unlighted, yet
some of their detail can be retained with Preserve Details.
If you see noise of one color considerably longer than the others when drag-
ging the Reduce Color Noise slider, click the Advanced button near the top of
the dialog box and work with each channel individually, according to its
needs. Also note the Remove JPEG Artifact check box at the bottom of the
window. If your image is suffering from JPEG compression problems, select-
ing that check box might help relieve the effects. (JPEG compression often
results in visible borders between 8 x 8 pixels squares within your image.)
Remember, too, that you can use the button to the right of the Settings pop-
up menu to save your correction for future use — it will be added to the
Setting menu.
Getting Creative with the Filter Gallery
You can apply and combine many (but not all) of Photoshop’s creative filters
by using Filter➪Filter Gallery. This integrated window lets you use multiple
filters at the same time rather than guessing which settings will look good
with another filter applied later. Each filter remains live (you can change the
settings) until you click OK. Check out Figure 15-9.
The basic workflow goes like this: Adjust a filter, add a new filter to the stack,
select the new filter in the middle pane, adjust the settings to the right, add a
new filter to the stack, and so on. If you adjust your first filter settings and
then click another filter in the middle column before adding another effect,
you replace the first filter rather than adding to it. Here’s my step-by-step
strategy for working in the Filter Gallery window:
1. Prepare your image before entering the Filter Gallery.
Many of Photoshop’s creative filters work best when you prepare the
image (or parts of the image) first. You’ve got a couple of key filters that
don’t appear in Filter Gallery — some to smooth fine detail, and one to
add some detail.

Figure 15-9: The expansive Filter Gallery interface.
• Smoothing detail: Because Photoshop’s art-related filters can con-
centrate on details in your image, too much fine detail can make
your filter effects crowded and cruddy. Before working with Ink
Outlines, for example, try eliminating the tiny little bits in your
image. You could try either Smart Blur or Surface Blur.
• Adding detail: Many of Photoshop’s filters don’t do anything if the
target area doesn’t have some texture or detail with which to work.
That’s where the Add Noise filter comes in handy, adding dark and
light specks to the smooth area. Use the Monochromatic and
Gaussian options, with an Amount setting from 10–15%. After
adding noise to the too-smooth area, consider using the Blur➪
Motion Blur filter or the Pixelate➪Crystallize filter (to make small
specks bigger).

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
2. Don’t forget layers and blending modes.
Make a copy of your layer before entering the Filter Gallery so you can
later mess around with layer blending modes and opacity to combine
the filtered version with the original, which can soften or even enhance
the effects you’ve applied.
3. Add to the stack before selecting filters.
You make your initial filter selection and adjustment. Then before you
switch to a different filter in the middle pane of the window, you need to
add a filter to the stack by clicking the New Effect Layer button in the
lower-right corner (to the left of the Trash icon)
4. Play with the stacking order.
Drag filters up and down in the stack at the lower right to change their
order.
The order in which the filters are applied often makes a huge difference
in the final appearance of your image.
5. Use the eyeball column.
It’s a good idea sometimes to hide one or more effects in the stack while
you fine-tune a filter’s settings.
Filters are cumulative — changes that you make to one filter can them-
selves be changed by other filters in the stack.
Not all creative filters are available in the Filter Gallery. Remember that
Photoshop has dozens of filters that are available only through the Filter
menu, not through Filter Gallery. And don’t forget that many filters can be
used only with 8-bit RGB (red/green/blue) images. If you see a lot of grayed-
out filters in the menu (or if Filter Gallery itself is grayed out in the Filter
menu), head to the Image➪Mode menu and make sure that you’re working in
8-bit color and the RGB color mode.
Push, Pull, and Twist with Liquify
Although the Lens Correction filter has added another powerful correction
tool to your arsenal, you still want to sometimes fix a photograph’s perspec-
tive or barrel distortion with Liquify. Perhaps. But with Lens Correction now
available, Liquify can concentrate on its fun side.

I know of nothing in Photoshop that can bring a smile faster and more easily
than creating some strange creature from a friend or loved one in Liquify. I
will readily admit that the glow produced by the praise of an art critic is grati-
fying, but does it compare to, “More, Uncle Pete! Give me bigger ears!”? It
would certainly be a disservice to the Liquify feature to overlook its powerful
image-correction capabilities, so please remember that almost anything you
can do to emphasize or enhance an attribute can be done in reverse to mini-
mize that aspect of the image. Make someone short and wide? You can also
make them tall and thin. Creating a bulging nose? Create a slim and pert nose.
It’s all possible with Liquify.
That having been said, examine Figure 15-10, which shows some rather dra-
matic changes. (But it should give you some idea of how useful Liquify can be
for more subtle tasks, like trimming tummies, toning arms and legs, thinning
noses, and other such work.)
Figure 15-10: Liquify gives you unbelievable control over the pixels in your image.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Take a look at the tools arrayed along the left edge of the Liquify window.
Here’s what they do, starting at the top:
 Forward Warp tool: Much like Photoshop’s Smudge tool, you click and
drag the Forward Warp tool to push the pixels around.
 Reconstruct tool: Use the Reconstruct tool as your “undo.” (When in
Liquify, you can use Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z, but it goes back only one step.) Drag
over areas that you want to restore to their original appearance.
 Twirl Clockwise tool: Click and hold the mouse button down or drag in
a circle to spin the pixels within the brush diameter. And if you want to
twirl counterclockwise, simply add the Option/Alt key.
 Pucker tool: The Pucker tools sucks pixels into the center of the brush.
You can click and hold or drag the Pucker tool. Holding down the
Option/Alt button toggles you to the Bloat tool.
 Bloat tool: The opposite of the Pucker tool, the Bloat tool pushes pixels
out from the center. Option/Alt switches you to the Pucker tool.
 Push Left tool: As you drag the Push Left tool, pixels are shifted to the
left of the path along which you drag (not necessarily to your left). If you
drag up, the pixels are shifted to the left on the screen; drag down, and
the pixels are shifted to the right on the screen. Use the Option/Alt key
to reverse the behavior and push pixels to the right of the path.
 Mirror tool: As you drag the Mirror tool, whatever pixels are immedi-
ately to the left of the cursor as you drag are flipped and pasted into the
brush along the path you drag. When dragging left to right, whatever is
directly above the cursor as you drag is flipped and copied into the
brush. For best results, use the Freeze Mask tool (see the upcoming
bullet) on the pixels that you want to copy before using the Mirror tool.
The Option/Alt key reverses the behavior, copying the pixels to the right
of the path as you drag.
 Turbulence tool: The Turbulence tool is great for adding smooth distor-
tion along the path you drag. Think of it as making waves along the path.
The Option/Alt key switches the Turbulence tool to the Reconstruct
tool.
 Freeze Mask tool: One of the most important tools, the Freeze Mask tool
lets you protect areas of your image from change. Paint over an area
(you’ll see a red mask) to freeze it — to keep it from changing.
 Thaw Mask tool: Unprotect areas with the Thaw Mask tool. It removes
the red overlay and lets you liquefy the area again.
 Hand tool: As always, the Hand tool lets you reposition an image in the
window when it doesn’t all fit. Just click and drag your image to move it
in the preview window.
 Zoom tool: As you might suspect, the Zoom tool functions as it usually
does. Click to zoom in, Option/Alt-click to zoom out, and click and drag
to zoom in on a specific area.

To the right in the Liquify window are a number of variables and options.
Brush Size is the tool brush diameter; Brush Density is comparable with
feathering (lower is softer); and Brush Pressure controls the strength of the
active tool.
The Reconstruct Options let you restore or partially restore your image to
the original appearance. The Reconstruct button is less like Step Backward or
Undo and more like Fade. Rather than reversing the liquification steps you’ve
already applied, it weakens them. The Mode pop-up menu offers several ways
to control how strictly the image is reconstructed. The mode that you select
is also used with the Reconstruct tool. (Revert is the most precise mode.)
The Restore All button returns your image to its pre-Liquify appearance.
If you’re working on only one layer of your image and that layer has a layer
mask or transparent areas, or if you make a selection before entering the
Liquify feature, you can use the buttons in the Mask Options area to
create frozen areas (areas that are
protected from change).
Near the bottom of the right side of
the Liquify window (and in Figure
15-10), you can see the View Options,
which let you show and hide the
mesh: the actual distortion you’re
creating. (Figure 15-11 shows a por-
tion of the mesh used in Figure
15-10.) Note the mesh size and color
options.
Do I Need Those Other Filters?
Photoshop has dozens of filters, creative and productive, that you access
through the Filter menu rather than through the Filter Gallery. Some do
strange and wonderful things to your selection or image, and some just do
strange things that you might never need. You can find a description of each
of Photoshop’s filters in Photoshop’s own Help, but a couple of them are
worth a bit of attention here.
Bending and bubbling
In the Filter➪Distort menu, you find both the Shear and the Spherize filters,
both of which are simpler alternatives to Liquify for many projects. Use the
Shear filter to bend a selection back and forth, creating curves. Use Spherize
to create a bulging, rounded image. Both Shear and Spherize are easiest to

precisely how you’re distorting the image.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
control when you make a selection
of your target and copy it to a new
layer. And, as you see in Figure 15-12,
Shear works only vertically, so you
might need to rotate your image
before and after the filter.
Creating clouds
Clouds make lovely, unobtrusive
backgrounds (as you see in Figure
5-13), can be scaled and transformed
to produce smoke or steam, and can
even create marbling effects. In the
Filter➪Render menu, you’ll find
Clouds and Difference Clouds. Both
use a mixture of the foreground and
background colors to create a cloud
pattern. The Clouds filter replaces
the content of the selection or layer
(if any), and Difference Clouds inter-
acts with the existing pixels (you
can’t use it on an empty layer) pretty
much like Clouds using the
Difference blending mode. Apply
Difference Clouds several times, per-
haps as many as 20, to create
abstract backgrounds and marble
patterns, or perhaps to simulate
microscope slides.

Spherize filter bulges and pinches.

In this part . . .
T
his part is more specialized than the others in
the book. These two chapters cover features
of Photoshop that you might never need.
Chapter 16 shows you how to streamline some of
your work with Photoshop’s automation com-
mands. You also read about recording Actions and
get a quick look at using scripting to automate
Photoshop. Keep in mind that Chapter 16 also
includes information on printing multiple images
on a single sheet of paper — saving both time and
money!
If you never create graphics for the Web, you
might skip Chapter 17. However, if spicing up your
online presence (or making a few bucks helping
someone else) sounds good, take a look. You see
how to optimize images for faster download as
well as how to create fancy rollover buttons and
animations to add action to a Web page.

Chapter 16
Streamlining Your Work in
Photoshop
In This Chapter
 Taking advantage of Photoshop’s built-in automation commands
 Working with Actions
 Using prerecorded scripts
A
lot of the work that you do in Photoshop is fun — experimenting with
filters, applying creative adjustments, cloning over former in-laws, that
sort of thing. A bunch of your work, though, is likely to be repetitive, mun-
dane, and even downright boring. That’s where automation comes in. If a task
isn’t fun to do, if you need to speed things up, or if you need to ensure
that the exact same steps are taken time after time, automation
is for you.
I open the chapter with a look at some of Photoshop’s
major automation features — commands that help
you quickly and easily create presentations and con-
tact sheets. Next, I show you a couple of production-
oriented commands that let you print multiple
images on a single sheet of paper (and we know 
how much money that can save!) and how to save
time by scanning multiple images in a single pass
and then automatically separating them into individ-
ual files. After that, you see how to play Photoshop’s
Actions and even record your own. The chapter wraps
up with a quick look at scripts, which are sort of little com-
puter programs that you use to control your computer —
Photoshop, other programs, your printer, or even an operating
system itself.

Running on Auto
Photoshop’s File➪Automate submenu
(as shown in Figure 16-1) contains a
collection of some of the most useful
features in the program. Chapter 10
shows you how to use a couple of the
Automate commands: that is, those
used for combining images. You’ll find
info there on both Photomerge (for
creating panoramas) and the new
Merge to HDR command (for combin-
ing multiple exposures). Chapter 4
introduces you to Web Photo Gallery
(for creating simple yet elegant Web
sites to display your images online).
Here, I show you how to use some of
the automation features to present
your images — and one that speeds
up bringing images into Photoshop.
Creating a PDF 
presentation
Portable Document Format (PDF), the
native file format of Adobe Acrobat,
has become an incredibly useful and
near-universal format. It’s hard to
find a computer that doesn’t have
Adobe Reader (free software to open
and view PDF files), and that helps
make PDF a wonderful format for
sharing or distributing your images.
You can use Photoshop’s File➪
Automate➪PDF Presentation (as
shown in Figure 16-2) to quickly and
easily create both onscreen presenta-
tions (complete with fancy transitions
between images) and multipage PDF
documents (suitable for distribution
and printing).
Figure 16- 1: Photoshop’s Automate commands
can make quick work of big jobs.
Figure 16-2: PDF is a great format for sharing
images as presentations or as documents.

To create a PDF in Photoshop, take the following steps:
1. If the files you want to use aren’t already open in Photoshop, click the
Browse button. You can click and then Shift-click to select a series of
images or Ô-click (Mac)/Ctrl-click (Windows) to select individual
images.
Hint: You must select the images; you can’t select only the folder.
After you click the Open button, the filenames appear in the PDF
Presentation window. Drag filenames up or down to reorder them.
2. In the Output Options area, you can elect to create an onscreen pre-
sentation or a multipage document.
If you opt to use Fit Page for Magnification, the images are scaled as nec-
essary to fill the screen or page. Using Actual Size shrinks images larger
than the screen (or page) but does not enlarge smaller images. If you
want, you can add the filename to each slide in the presentation or each
page in the PDF. This is a good idea when sending images to someone
who needs to know the image name, say, to order prints and give you
cash.
3. Select how you want the presentation to play.
You can have the presentation automatically switch images after a given
number of seconds (or opt for manual slide advance), you can have the
presentation automatically rewind and begin playing again (loop), or
you can pick transitions between images. Do your audience a favor and
pick a single transition and stick with it — preferably one simple transi-
tion, such as Wipe Left or Wipe Right. Those too-busy transitions are the
21st-century version of PowerPoint clip art — fun to play with, but dis-
tracting to your audience.
4. Click the Save button.
You see the Save dialog box, from which you pick a location and a name
and then click another Save button.
5. In the Save Adobe PDF dialog box, make things simple for yourself
and choose Smallest File Size or High Quality Print from the Adobe
PDF Preset pop-up menu at the top.
If you’re creating a presentation or want to create a multipage PDF from
which the recipient can’t print full-size images, choose Smallest File Size.
For a multipage document from which you do want the client to print
great images, use High Quality Print.
327

Part IV: Power Photoshop 
6. The only other area of the dialog box that you really need to consider
is Security.
You can assign a password to the file that the recipient needs to open
and view the presentation or multipage PDF document. Alternatively,
you can require no password to open the file but rather assign a pass-
word for printing or changing the file.
7. Finally, at the end of the road, click the Save PDF button to actually
generate the final file.
Unlike the original PDF Presentation, the Photoshop CS2 version has real PDF
security. When you password-protect your file, anyone attempting to open
the PDF file or presentation in any program — Photoshop included — 
needs the password. (PDFs generated by the original PDF Presentation were
password-protected for Acrobat but not Photoshop.)
Collecting thumbnails in a contact sheet
In the old Dark(room) Ages, photographers regularly made a record of which
images were on which film strips by exposing those strips on a piece of pho-
tographic paper, thus creating a con-
tact sheet. The contact sheet serves
the same purpose as thumbnails or
previews in Bridge or the Open dialog
box or thumbnail images on a Web
page — they show which image is
which. Hard copy contact sheets 
are useful to present to a client.
Photoshop can automate the process
for you with File➪Automate➪Contact
Sheet II (see Figure 16-3).
1. Select a source folder from the
Use drop-down list in the
Source Images area.
2. (Optional) If you want to
include the images in any sub-
folders that might be within
that folder, select the Include
All Subfolders check box.
3. Using the Units, Width, and
Height options in the Document area, describe your document, using
the printable area of your page — not the paper size.
4. Select a resolution.
I recommend 300 pixels per inch (ppi) if printing and 72 ppi if you’ll be
slicing the image for your Web site.
Figure 16-3: If you need a printed record of
your images, consider Contact Sheet II.

5. Use the Mode drop-down list box to choose a color mode (RGB unless
printing to a color laser printer) and also decide whether you want to
flatten layers (which makes a smaller but less versatile file).
After all the external decisions are made, you need to make some choices
about the layout and placement of the images on the page. Note in Figure 16-3
that you have some important information below the Cancel button. Contact
Sheet II gives you a preview of the layout, tells you how many pages (and
images) you’re going to generate, and shows you how large each image will
be on the page. Keep an eye on this area when making decisions in the
Thumbnails section of the dialog box.
You can choose to have the images
added to the page row by row (the
second image is to the right of the
first) or column by column (the
second image is directly below the
first). You also choose the number of
rows and columns, which determines
the size of each individual image. You
then need to decide whether to use
Auto-Spacing, to calculate the spac-
ing between images, and to rotate
images or not. If your source folder
has a mixture of landscape and por-
trait images, rotating makes sure that
each is exactly the same size —
although some will be sideways. If
image orientation is more important
than having identical sizes, don’t use
the Rotate for Best Fit option. Take a
look at the bottom row in Figure 16-4
to see how an unrotated image
appears in a contact sheet.
If your folder is filled with portrait-
oriented images, you can certainly have more columns than rows so that
each image better fills the area allotted for it. For example, when printing 20
portrait images, using 5 columns and 4 rows produces larger printed images
than using 4 columns and 5 rows.
Contact Sheet II also lets you add the filename as a caption below each image,
which proves to be a very handy way of tracking your images. As you see in
Figure 16-3, your font choices are rather limited. (Make sure you use a font
size small enough to get the whole name within the width of the individual
images.) By default, the filename is in black.

don’t use the Rotate for Best Fit option.

Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Scanning multiple photos in one pass
You can often save a lot of time by placing multiple photos on the glass of
your scanner and scanning them all at once. You don’t need to reopen the
scanner software or generate a new preview every time; rather, you just scan
one big picture and make individual little pictures from it later in Photoshop.
Photoshop’s File➪Automate menu offers a neat timesaving featured named
Crop and Straighten Photos, which generates a separate file for each photo it
finds in the scan.
For best results, place the photos on
the scanner’s bed with a slight gap
between them. I like to place a sheet
of colored paper or plastic on top of
the photos, between the backs of the
photos and the scanner’s lid (as you
see in Figure 16-5). I use paper or
plastic that is a very different color
from any color found along the edges
of the photos. This gives Photoshop
a good idea about where each photo
ends and the next begins.
After the scan is complete and the
image is open in Photoshop, use the
File➪Automate➪Crop and Straighten
Photos command. No dialog box, no
submenus — just select the com-
mand and wait a few seconds while Photoshop identifies the individual
scanned images and creates a separate file for each.
Saving paper with Picture Package
Suppose you need to print a dozen images, each at 4 x 5 inches. Printing each
on a separate sheet of paper takes 12 sheets (oh, the cost!) and 12 print
cycles. Use the File➪Automate➪Picture Package command (as shown in
Figure 16-6) to put four 4 x 5 images on a single page, and you use three
sheets of paper and wait through only three print cycles. Um, let’s see, which
do you want to do. . . .
Figure 16-5: Use a contrasting background to
help Crop and Straighten Photos find edges.

Figure 16-6: Multiple images on a single page with Picture Package.
Picture Package creates zones on a sheet of paper and places copies of the
selected image, properly sized according the layout you select, in each zone.
You can click each of the zones to select a different image or leave Picture
Package set to print multiple copies of a single image.
Here are some tips for working efficiently with Picture Package:
 Pick the Page Size first. The layouts available are all based on the page
size. The Layout pop-up menu shows only layouts designed for the
selected dimensions.
For Page Size, use the printable area of the page (the area within your
printer’s minimum margins), not the paper size.
 Click each zone to add an image. By default, Picture Package uses mul-
tiple copies of the same image in the Layout area. Click each of those
images to change the photo assigned to that spot.
331
Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop

332
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
 Create custom layouts. Click the Edit Layout button to create custom
arrangements to suit your needs. Click a zone and drag its bounding box
to resize and move, or work numerically for precise zones.
 Check your resolution. If you intend to print your Picture Package page,
you probably want a resolution of 300 ppi, or perhaps 240 ppi.
 Decide whether to flatten. If you don’t select the Flatten All Layers
check box, you can further manipulate the result, perhaps adding any
necessary adjustment layers to fine-tune a specific image. Maintaining
layers also lets you realign the images to make cutting them apart later
much easier. As you can see in Figure 16-6, the edges of the two images
on the left are not aligned, which will result in some extra work with the
paper cutter or scissors.
 Check your font size. Make sure that if you add a label, you use an
appropriate font size. If your label is too small, nobody can read it; con-
versely, if it’s too large, you might disrupt the feel of the image.
 Consider using Contact Sheet. If you have a large number of images to
process, you might be better off using Contact Sheet II because it auto-
matically generates multiple pages from a single folder.
Ready, Set, Action!
In Photoshop, an Action is simply a
recorded series of steps that you can
play back on another image to repli-
cate an effect or technique. To
choose a wild example, say that
every image in your new book about
Photoshop needs to be submitted at
a size of exactly 1024 x 768 pixels at
300 ppi, regardless of content.
Record an Action that uses the Image
Size command to change resolution,
and then use the Canvas Size com-
mand to expand the image to 1024 x
768 pixels. Use that Action (play the
Action) on each image before submit-
ting it. Better yet, wait until all the
images for a chapter are ready and
then use the Batch command to play
the Action automatically on each of
them!
Actions and the Batch command not
only streamline repetitive tasks; they
also ensure precision — that every
Figure 16-7: The Actions palette menu includes
sets of Actions you can load into the palette.

one of those images will be exactly 1024 x 768 pixels, each and every time.
But Actions also have a creative side to them. The lower part of the Action
palette’s menu (see Figure 16-7) contains Action sets that you can load into
the palette to produce frame and border effects, text effects, and more. (The
content of your Actions palette menu might differ from that shown in Figure
16-7.) You can also purchase collections of Actions from commercial sources.
To work with an Action, you open an image, select the Action in the Actions
palette, and then click the Play button at the bottom of the palette. (As you
can see in Figure 16-7, the three buttons to the left use the near-universal
symbols for Stop, Record, and Play. The three to the right use the standard
Adobe symbols indicating New Set, New Action, and Trash.)
Any step in the Actions palette that doesn’t have a check mark in the left
column is skipped when you play the Action. Any step that has a symbol visi-
ble in the second column (the modal control column) pauses when you play
the Action. Click in the second column when you want the Action to wait for
you to do something. Perhaps you’ll click in that column next to a Crop step
so that you can adjust the Crop tool’s bounding box. You might click in the
second column next to an Image Size step so that you can input a specific
size or choose a resampling algorithm. After you make a change or input a
value for that step, press Return/Enter to continue playing the Action.
Notice the grayed-out Save Actions command in the palette’s menu in Figure
16-7. Remember that you have to select a set of Actions in the palette, not an
individual Action, to use the Save Actions command. If you want to save only
one Action, create a new set and Option/Alt-drag the Action to that set to
copy it. You can also create a printable text file (.txt) of your Actions set by
holding down the Ô+Option/Ctrl+Alt keys when selecting Save Actions. Text
versions of your Actions provide an easy reference for what each Action (and
step) does to an image.
If you get hooked on Actions, you’ll also want to try Button Mode in the
Actions palette menu. Each Action appears in the palette as a color-coded
button. You don’t see the steps of the Action, so you don’t know whether an
individual step is being skipped and you can’t change the modal control
column, but you might like the color-coding to sort your Actions.
Recording your own Actions
The real power of Actions comes to you when you record your own. Sure, the
sets of Actions included with Photoshop are great, and those commercial
packages of Actions have some good stuff too, but it’s not your stuff. When
you record your own Actions, you record the steps that work for your
images, your workflow, and your artistic vision. (Remember, too, that Actions
can be recorded in ImageReady.)
333
Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop

334
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Actions can’t float free in
Photoshop’s Actions palette: Each
Action must be part of a set of
Actions. Before beginning to record
your Action, you can select an exist-
ing set or click the fourth button at
the bottom of the palette to create 
a new set. When you have a set
selected, you can then click the New
Action button (second from right).
Then, in the New Action dialog box
(as shown in Figure 16-8), assign a
name (and color-code for Button
Mode and perhaps assign an F-key
combination) and click the Record
button. From that point forward, just
about everything you do in Photoshop is recorded as part of the Action until
you click the Stop button at the bottom of the Actions palette. No worries,
though — you can always delete unwanted steps after the Action is recorded
by dragging them to the Trash icon at the bottom of the Actions palette. And
if you want to change something in the Action, you can double-click a step
and rerecord it.
You can record most of Photoshop’s commands and tools in an Action, but
you can’t control anything outside of Photoshop. (For that you need scripting,
introduced later in this chapter.) You can’t, for example, use an Action to
print (controlling the printer’s own print driver), or copy a filename from the
Mac Finder or Windows Explorer, or open Illustrator and select a path to add
to your Photoshop document. Nor can you record the movement of the
cursor in your Actions, which generally rules out recording painting tools.
Here are some tips about recording your own custom Actions:
 Open a file first. Open the file in which you’re going to work before you
start recording the Action. Otherwise, the Open command becomes part
of the Action, and the Action will play on that specific file every time you
use it. You can, however, record the Open command within an Action to
open a second file — perhaps to copy something from that file.
 Record the Close command after Save As. When you record the Save As
command in an Action, you’re creating a new file on your hard drive.
Follow the Save As command with the File➪Close command (and elect
Don’t Save when prompted). That closes the original image.
 Use Percent as the unit of measure. If you need an element in your art-
work to be in the same spot regardless of file size or shape (like a copy-
right notice in the lower-right corner), change the unit of measure to
Percent in Photoshop’s Preferences before recording the Action.
Figure 16-8: After you click the New Action
button, you see the New Action dialog box.

 Record/insert menu com-
mands. When you use a menu
command while recording your
Action, the actual values that
you enter into the dialog box are
recorded, too. If you’d rather
select the values appropriate for
each individual image (perhaps
for the Unsharp Mask filter),
insert the command rather than
record it. When you reach that
specific spot in your process,
use the Actions palette menu command Insert Menu Item (refer to Figure
16-7). With the dialog box open, mouse to and select the appropriate
menu command; then click OK to continue recording the Action. In
Figure 16-9, you see the Insert Menu Item dialog box when first opened
(before a command is selected) and after I used the mouse to select the
Image Size command from Photoshop’s Image menu.
 Record multiple versions of a step, but activate one. Say you want to
record an Action that does a lot of stuff to an image, including changing
the pixel dimensions with the Image Size command. However, you want
to use this Action with a variety of images that require two or three dif-
ferent final sizes. You can record as many Image Size commands as you
want in that one Action — just remember to clear (uncheck) the left
column in the Actions palette next to each of the Image Size steps except
the one you currently want to use. And you can record an Action within
an Action, too. Just play the second Action while recording the first.
 Insert a message or warning.
Use the Actions palette menu
command Insert Stop to send a
message to anyone who plays
your Action. The message could
be something like “You must
have a type layer active in the
Layers palette before playing
this Action” with buttons for
Stop and Continue. Or you
could phrase it more specifi-
cally: “If you have not selected a
type layer in the Layers palette,
click Stop. If a type layer is
active in the Layers palette,
click Continue.” The more pre-
cise the message, the less confusion later. In Figure 16-10, you see the
Record Stop dialog box, where you type your message when recording
the Action, as well as a look at how the message appears when the
Action is played back later.

Part IV: Power Photoshop 
 Remember Conditional Mode
Change and Fit Image. These
two commands in the Automate
menu are designed to be
recorded in an Action that you
might later use on a wide vari-
ety of images.
• Conditional Mode Change
is very handy when your
Action (or final result)
depends on the image
being in a specific color
mode. When you record
Conditional Mode Change
in an Action, every image,
regardless of its original
color mode, is converted
to the target color mode
(see Figure 16-11). Say, for
example, that you need to apply a certain filter in an Action, but
that filter is available only for RGB images. Record Conditional
Mode Change before the filter and the Action will play properly.
• Fit Image specifies a maximum width
and height that the image being
processed must not exceed, regard-
less of size or shape — great for
batch processing images for the Web.
Fit Image maintains your images’
aspect ratios (to avoid distortion)
while ensuring that every image
processed will fit within the param-
eters you specify (see Figure 16-12).
 Always record an Action from a copy of your image. Because the steps
that you record in the Action are actually executed on the open file,
record your Action using a copy of the original image. That way, if some-
thing goes wrong, your real image is protected.
Working with the Batch command
Photoshop’s File➪Automate➪Batch command plays back a single Action on a
number of files. You select an Action to play and also a folder of image files to
play it on; then you decide what you want to do with the files after the Action
finishes with them. You can leave the images open in Photoshop, save and
close them, or (much safer) save them to another folder, preserving the

converts every image to the target color mode.
Figure 16-12: Fit Image scales all
images to fit within the specified
dimensions.

originals. Figure 16-13 shows the
Batch dialog box and also the pop-up
menu for the fields in the File Naming
area. (When you select a new folder
as the Destination in Batch, you must
tell Photoshop how you want the
new files to be named.)
You must remember three things
when assigning filenames:
 Include a variable. Something
must change from filename to
filename. Select one of the top
nine items in the pop-up menu
(some version of the document
name or a serial number or a
serial letter). It doesn’t have to
be in the first field, but one ele-
ment of the filename must be different from file to file.
 Don’t use a period (.) in any field. You can type in any of the fields
(except the last one you use), but for compatibility, stick with letters,
numbers, underscores (_), and hyphens (-).
Absolutely do not use a period (.) in the filename. The only period that
can be used in a filename is the one that’s automatically added immedi-
ately before the file extension.
 The last element must be the file extension. In the last field you use,
you must choose either 
EXTENSION or extension from
the pop-up menu.
You have two other decisions of note
in the Batch dialog box. When you
elect to suppress any Open com-
mands in the Action, you protect
yourself from poorly recorded
Actions that start by opening the
image with which they were
recorded. However, if the Action
depends on the content of a second
file, you do not want to override that
Open command. Generally, you want
to override any Save As commands
recorded in the Action, relying
instead on the decisions that you
make in the Batch dialog box to
determine the fate of the image.

Sticking to the Script
You can use AppleScript (Mac), Visual Basic (Windows), and JavaScript
(both) with Photoshop. Photoshop CS2 includes several very useful scripts in
the File➪Scripts menu. (Your list of built-in scripts might differ from that
shown in Figure 16-14.)
Among the prerecorded scripts are
 Image Processor: This converts Raw files to PSD, TIFF, or JPEG.
 Export Layers to Files: This creates a separate image file from each
layer in your image.
You can find more scripts on the Internet, including some at http://share.
studio.adobe.com. Select Scripts from the Adobe Photoshop Download
pop-up menu.
Scripts are much more powerful than Photoshop’s Actions because they can
control elements outside of Photoshop itself. AppleScripts and Visual Basic
scripts can even run multiple programs and play JavaScripts. If you’re inter-
ested in scripting, go to the Photoshop folder on your hard drive and explore
the content of the Scripting Guide folder. You’ll find plenty of information to
get you started!

nderstand this one important point before reading further in this chap-
ter: Photoshop and ImageReady are image-creation tools, not Web
development tools. You use Photoshop and ImageReady to create graphic
elements with which you construct a Web site in a dedicated Web design pro-
gram, such as Adobe GoLive. Sure, you could design and create and slice and
save an entire Web page using only Photoshop, and you could post that page
on a Web server, creating a Web site. You could also pound nails with a
screwdriver. Sure, it works (eventually), but it’s not the most effi-
cient way to go about your work. If you just need to put
together a simple site to show off your photos, use
Photoshop’s Web Photo Gallery (see Chapter 4). If you
want to create a full-fledged Web site or you want to
become a professional Web designer, use GoLive.
That having been said, in this chapter, I show you
how to optimize your Web graphics, making sure
they load in a Web browser quickly and efficiently.
You also see how to subdivide artwork into slices —
sections of the image that can be optimized individu-
ally. This chapter is also the place to read how to create
rollovers, buttons, and other images that change appear-
ance interactively, as well as how to create animations, little
mini-movies, or cartoons that play on your Web page.

Integrating Photoshop and ImageReady
ImageReady is installed with Photoshop, right in
the Photoshop folder. You can work with
ImageReady as a separate program, launching it
without Photoshop, or you can use it in conjunc-
tion with Photoshop. You can do your creative
work in Photoshop and then — with a single
click — transfer your image to ImageReady to
slice, optimize, and otherwise juice it up for the
Web. To open an image in ImageReady directly
from Photoshop (to jump to ImageReady), click
the Edit in ImageReady button at the very
bottom of Photoshop’s Toolbox (as shown in
Figure 17-1). To return to Photoshop, click the
Edit in Photoshop button at the bottom of the
ImageReady toolbox. Or, if there’s no need to
return to Photoshop, simply save your image
and close it.
Compromising Quality for Speed
Although the days of slow dialup Internet con-
nections seem to be fading in the rearview
mirror rather rapidly, you should nonetheless be
aware of the size of your graphics as you prepare
them for use on a Web site. That person who visits your Web site through
broadband connection from home or office might also find the need to visit
while on the road, using a hotspot (public wireless connection) in some coffee
joint, or maybe using a PDA (personal digital assistant) rather than a laptop.
Because such connections might not be as efficient as a cable or DSL link,
keeping your graphics file small (and therefore quick to display onscreen)
helps keep your visitor happy. Keep in mind that smaller files not only down-
load faster, but they also take up less space on your Web server.
Optimizing with Save for Web
The process of optimizing an image file removes all non-image data to mini-
mize file size. Using Photoshop’s File➪Save for Web feature, you can fine-tune
the file size by selecting a compression level (JPEG format) and also choose
how the image appears as it downloads. When working in the Save for Web
window, use the tabs in the upper-left corner to see the original or an opti-
mized version, or you can compare the original image with one or three opti-
mization alternatives, as shown in Figure 17-2.
Figure 17-1: Easily move
between Photoshop and
ImageReady with Toolbox
buttons.

Figure 17-2: Save for Web offers multiple view options, including 4-Up.
When working in the 4-Up configuration, you can compare four previews to
see how different file formats and options affect not only the image’s appear-
ance but also the file size (shown below each preview).
To the upper right of the preview area is a small triangle that opens a menu
from which you choose how to interpret the image’s colors (I prefer
Uncompensated Color) and a modem speed for estimating download time
(with the file size under each preview). To the left of the preview area, you
have four tools: Hand, Slice, Zoom, and Eyedropper. (They function in Save
for Web as they do in Photoshop.) Directly below the preview area, you can
change the zoom factor, keep track of the color under the cursor, and open
the image in a Web browser to preview.

Part IV: Power Photoshop 
To the lower right of the preview area is something new in Save for Web. You
can preview how the selected optimization settings will look for an anima-
tion. You can also click the button it below to close Save for Web and open
the image in ImageReady. You make decisions about file format and format-
specific options in the area to the right of the previews.
Save for Web works with only those image formats you can use on a Web
page. You can’t, for example, see a TIFF image in a Web browser, so Save for
Web won’t generate a TIFF file.
Here’s a look at when to use each file format and which options to choose:
 GIF: Choose GIF for interface items that consist primarily of solid colors,
without subtle or large gradients. Thumbnails of photographs (up to
perhaps 100 pixels square) are fine as GIFs, too. However, don’t use this
format for full-size photos — each GIF file can contain a maximum of 256
different colors, which can greatly degrade the appearance of a photo.
Generally you want to create the
color table, which is the list of
specific colors used in the
image, with the Selective option
(see Figure 17-3). The number 
of colors that you select in the
Colors pop-up menu has a direct
impact on the size of the file.
Reduce the number of colors 
to shrink the file. Note, too, that
you can edit the color table
directly in the Color Table tab
(which is used only with GIF and
PNG-8).
If the image includes transpar-
ent areas, select the Trans-
parency check box. If there are
shadows or glows over the
transparency, choose Diffusion
Transparency Dither; if there are
distinct edges between opaque
and transparent, consider using
No Transparency Dither.
Marking the Interlaced check
box enables the Web browser to
begin showing the image before
it fully downloads, which gives
your Web page’s visitors the
illusion of progress, even if the
Figure 17-3: You see these variables when
saving as GIF.

connection is slow. Although you have the option of using lossy com-
pression to further reduce file size, using it will degrade the appearance
of your image.
 JPEG: JPEG is your all-purpose file format for photographs and other
artwork that includes subtle
transitions between colors. The
Quality setting determines the
amount of compression applied
to the image. The greater the
compression, the smaller the
file size. However, JPEG uses
lossy compression (some image
data is discarded to reduce file
size, then “guesstimated” when
the image is reopened). The
greater the compression, the
lower the image quality.
Generally speaking, you’ll
reduce the Quality setting (as
shown in Figure 17-4) a bit at a
time until you reach an unac-
ceptable level of image degra-
dation.
The Progressive option enables
the image to display while it
downloads. Save for Web also
allows you to apply a little blur-
ring to your images to further
shrink file size (with the associ-
ated image degradation, of
course). And although JPEG
doesn’t support transparency in
an image, you can use the Matte
pop-up menu to match the Web
page’s background color. 
In Figure 17-4, you also see the
Image Size tab, which is available with all file formats. Use the Image Size
tab the way you use Photoshop’s Image➪Image Size command to change
the pixel dimensions of an image. (There’s no provision for changing the
print dimensions or resolution, however, because this is a Web-oriented
feature.)
343
Chapter 17: Spiffing Up Your Online Offerings
Figure 17-4: You balance file size with image
quality when saving a JPEG image.

344
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
 PNG-8: PNG-8 is an alternative
to GIF and offers all the same
options (as you see in Figure
17-5), with the exception of
lossy compression. Use PNG-8
cautiously, however, because
not all Web browsers support
the format.
 PNG-24: Developed as an alter-
native to JPEG, PNG-24 uses
lossless compression (no image
data is discarded). Also, unlike
JPEG, PNG-24 does support
transparency, but it’s not sup-
ported by all Web browsers,
and the file sizes are not as
small as JPEG. As you see in
Figure 17-6, you have few
choices to make when saving
an image in the PNG-24 file
format. If the image includes
transparency, select that
option. The Interlaced option
enables the image to appear in
the Web browser while it’s still
downloading. Select a Matte
color if you need the image to
blend into the Web page’s back-
ground along the edges.
In addition to use on the Web,
you can use PNG-24 when
preparing images for
PowerPoint presentations or
for insertion into a Microsoft
Word document.
 WBMP: The WBMP file format
(see Figure 17-7) is used exclu-
sively for wireless Internet
devices that cannot display
color or grayscale. Each pixel in
a WBMP image is either black
or white. Choose from diffusion,
pattern, and noise dithering to
best reproduce the image. Make
your decision based entirely on
appearance because there will
be no difference in file size.
Figure 17-6: PGN-24 offers but a few simple
options.
Figure 17-7: If you choose the Dither option, you
select the amount of dithering.
Figure 17-5: Except for lossy compression, you
have the same options with PNG-8 and GIF.

To the right of the Preset pop-up menu in Save for Web is the little black trian-
gle that indicates a menu. In the Save for Web menu, you’ll find two very sig-
nificant features:
 Optimize to File Size: This feature enables you to select a target file size
and let Save For Web choose the options that best preserve image
appearance while meeting the size requirement. When working with a
sliced image, you can elect to optimize the currently selected slice, opti-
mize each slice to the same target size, or optimize all the slices in the
image to a specified total file size. (Read more about slices in the upcom-
ing section, “Creating slices: How and why.”)
 Edit Output Settings: This feature lets you monkey around with how
Save for Web generates slice names, tables for sliced images, and other
HTML-related options. Unless you need to make some changes to meet
the requirements of your Web development program, I suggest you use
the defaults.
The Output Settings defaults are fine with this one exception — one feature in
Output Settings that you should consider using when applicable. Normally
when you create a file with Save for Web, the image displays as, well, an
image in a Web browser. You can, however, also generate backgrounds in
Save for Web, comprising small files that are tiled (repeated as many times as
necessary) to fill the background of a Web page. And you don’t even need to
open the Output Settings dialog box to access the feature. Here’s how:
1. Select your various Save for Web optimization options.
2. Click the Save button in Save for Web.
3. In the Save As dialog box that appears, choose
• Format: HTML and Images
• Settings: Background Image
The HTML file contains Web-specific information that tells the Web
browser how to display the image. HTML is the language of the Web.
When you open the HTML file in a Web browser, the image repeats to fill
the background of the page.
Compare using an image as a background (left) and as a simple image (right)
in Figure 17-8.

Image size, resolution, and color for the Web
Web browsers, the programs used to view Web
sites, are not particularly sophisticated when it
comes to graphics. They can’t zoom or scale an
image the way you can in, for example,
Photoshop. Many of the Web browsers available
don’t use ICC profiles to ensure correct color.
(ICC profiles — color profiles — are embedded
in images to make colors uniform from device to
device.) Here are a few things to keep in mind
when preparing images for the Web. 
Use an image size that’s appropriate for display
in a Web browser. Generally speaking, you don’t
want your viewer to have to scroll the browser
window to see parts of your image. When
deciding how tall to make each image, consider
your target audience. If you think the folks
you’re targeting might have older computers or
laptops, plan your Web pages and images
around a monitor set to 800 x 600 pixels. If you
expect a more current audience, you might
want to assume a monitor resolution of 1024 x
768 pixels. And don’t forget to allow for the Web
browser interface! Subtract about 100 pixels
from the height of your planned window.
Always measure Web images in pixels, ignoring
print dimensions and “resolution.” An image
that’s 450 pixels tall and 350 pixels wide displays
exactly the same in a Web browser at 300 ppi as
it does at 72 ppi.
When it comes to color management and the
Web, I’m from the school of None is Better.
Because not all Web browsers can convert
colors using ICC color profiles, using profiles
can result in a significant difference in image
appearance between Photoshop and the Web.
In Photoshop’s Color Settings dialog box, you
can select Color Management Off and work 
in a completely unmanaged environment.
Alternatively, when preparing an individual
image for the Web, use the Edit➪Assign Profile
command and select Don’t Color Manage This
Document. In Save for Web, click the triangle to
the upper right of the preview area and select
Uncompensated Color. When saving a JPEG
file, do not mark the ICC Profile check box.
Also on the subject of Web color, you might hear
talk of using the Web-safe palette, which is a
collection of 216 specific colors that belong to
the system-level color table for both Macintosh
and Windows. The Web-safe palette is a
holdover from the days when computer moni-
tors typically displayed 8-bit color, restricting
the number of different colors to 256. These
days, there’s little need for the Web-safe
palette. Even Web-surfing PDAs and cellular
phones do a good job with color.

To actually use this background, you copy/paste the HTML code from the
HTML file into your Web page’s HTML file (.html extension) in the appropri-
ate location and then save the image file in the Web site’s Images folder.
Optimizing in ImageReady
When working in ImageReady, you select a file format and your options in the
Optimize palette, and then use the File➪Save Optimized As command to gen-
erate your Web image file. The format-specific options in the Optimize palette
mirror those in Save for Web with one major difference: ImageReady has the
capability of maintaining an image’s metadata. Metadata can include file
descriptions, source information (camera make, model, settings, and so on),
keywords and categories, and even the image’s edit history.
Generally speaking, you might want to add a file description and copyright
information to a Web image (the Add Custom ImageReady Metadata option).
However, adding full metadata can create a much larger file than necessary.
(If the people with whom you’re sharing files need metadata, send them the
real file rather than posting it as an image on a Web site.)
Slicing and Adding Image Maps
Slices, which can be created in either Photoshop or ImageReady, divide a
single image into two or more functional areas. Slicing an image permits you
to optimize each section according to that section’s needs. When saving, you
must generate both HTML and images so that you have the Web code
(HTML) to create a table as well as its images. (The table tells the Web
browser, using an HTML file, how to arrange and align the individual image
files generated from the slices.) Image maps, which you create in ImageReady,
identify hot spots in the image: that is, links to other Web pages or Web sites.
When the visitor clicks a hot spot in an image map, that Web browser is redi-
rected to the linked page.
Creating slices: How and why
If your image has areas with different optimization requirements, you might
want to slice it up, subdividing it into smaller images to be reassembled in a
Web page. You might, for example, have artwork that contains both a photo
(best optimized as JPEG) and areas of solid color (best optimized as GIF). Or
your design might include static areas and an area that contains an animation
or rollovers.

Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Both Photoshop and ImageReady allow you to create slices either by using
the Slice tool or by creating layer-based slices (slices based on the content of
a layer). When you drag the Slice tool to create a slice, the program automati-
cally generates the other necessary slices to ensure that the entire image is
properly divided into rectangles. (Like all graphic files, slices are rectangu-
lar.) When you use the Layer➪New Layer Based Slice command (Photoshop
or ImageReady), a new user-defined slice is created (through all layers) based
on a rectangle that includes all the content of the current layer. And, as with
the Slice tool, other slices are automatically generated for the rest of the
image.
Figure 17-9 shows a sliced image. Note that slice numbers and borders of the
slice at the top and in the bottom left are gray, indicating slices generated
automatically by the program rather than user-defined or layer-based slices.
Figure 17-9: Slice a complex image to optimize parts individually or create rollovers.

Creating individual slices for each of the links in the left column lets you
easily create rollover effects (discussed later in this chapter). Creating sepa-
rate slices for the Garden Grow Cam window and its panning controls lets
you replace those images in the table with the actual functional elements in
your Web development program. (A live camera link and its panning controls
are beyond the scope of Photoshop/ImageReady.)
Designating links with image maps
Unlike a slice, an image map can be any shape and doesn’t generate a sepa-
rate image in a table. Instead, image maps create locations in your image that
serve as links to other Web pages or sites. When the visitor clicks a point in
the image map, the Web browser goes to the designated Web page.
Create image maps in
ImageReady with any of the
three Image Map tools. If
you need a simple rectan-
gle or circle for your click-
able area, not a problem —
just grab the appropriate
Image Map tool. If you need
an irregularly shaped image
map, such as that shown in
Figure 17-10, use the
Polygon Image Map tool.
Click to create a series of
path-like segments that
define the clickable area for
the image map. When the
visitor clicks within the shape, the Web browser goes to the URL (Uniform
Resource Locator — the Web address) that you specify in the Image Map
palette. (The Image Map palette, by default, nests with the Slice and Table
palettes. Like all palettes, you can show and hide it through the Window
menu.)
Creating Rollover Buttons
A rollover is a button (or other part of your Web page) that changes appear-
ance when the visitor’s mouse rolls over that spot. The appearance can
change when the mouse is over the spot, the mouse button is pressed down,
the mouse button is released, the cursor moves off the spot, or all the above.
(Consider, if you will, links on a Web page that change color after you click
them.)

pages.

350
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Adding a rollover state
In ImageReady (not Photoshop), you use the Web Content and Layers
palettes to create rollovers. Click the Create Rollover State button at the
bottom of the Web Content palette (second from right), and then show/hide
layers in the Layers palette to change the appearance of the image. In Figure
17-11, the Normal rollover state (how the button appears when the page
opens) has three layers visible. The Down state (when the visitor clicks the
button) has another layer visible, which dramatically changes the appear-
ance of the button. Double-click the rollover state’s name in the Web Content
palette if you want to change the mouse action that triggers the change in
appearance. When added to your Web page, the button will show the Down
appearance as long as the cursor is over the button and the mouse button is
pressed. When the mouse button is released, the button returns to the
Normal appearance.
Figure 17-11: Rollover buttons use the Web Content and Layers palettes.

Saving a rollover button
Like slices, rollovers require that you choose Format: HTML and Images in
the Save Optimized As dialog box. To use the button in a Web page, you 
copy the content of the Images folder to the Web site’s Images folder and
copy/paste the HTML from the HTML document into the appropriate place in
the Web page’s HTML document. If you choose the Web site’s main folder as
the save location, the images are added to the existing Images folder.
Although this saves a step, you won’t have a backup copy elsewhere on your
hard drive. You can use GIF or JPEG for the file format in the Optimize palette
when creating rollovers.
Rollovers are perhaps a bit easier to comprehend and plan when you know
how the process works. The HTML code that you generate with the Save
Optimized As command contains a series of instructions to the Web browser.
In effect, those instructions tell the browser to pay attention to the visitor’s
cursor. When it’s over the button, load one image. When the mouse button is
down, load a different image. When the mouse moves away, load a third
image. A rollover is simply a number of different images, with different
appearances, that load at different times according to the mouse behavior.
A Moving Experience: Animation
Animated GIF files (yes, they must be GIFs, never JPEGs or PNGs) are similar
to rollovers in that both are layer-based — you change the appearance of the
image in the Layers palette. You use the Animation palette in ImageReady or in
Photoshop along with the Layers palette to create individual frames. You also
control playback rate (how fast the frames change) in the Animations palette.
Creating a basic animation
Animations can record a number of changes to the image from frame to
frame. Layer position, opacity, and layer style are a few of your basic tools for
changing the appearance of the
image between frames. In Figure
17-12, the four frames of the anima-
tion have only one difference:
namely, the color of the Outer Glow
layer effect. When the animated GIF
file loads into a Web page, the Best
Prices logo appears to flash in four
neon colors, which are sure to catch
the viewer’s eye. (Best of all,
because of the progression of colors,
the words Best Prices appear to
pulse and change size.)
351
Chapter 17: Spiffing Up Your Online Offerings
Figure 17-12: Changing a layer style from frame
to frame creates a basic animation.

352
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
The process is simple:
1. Open the artwork in Photoshop or ImageReady.
You can create an animation from just about any image.
2. Open and arrange the Animation and Layers palettes.
Because you’ll be moving back and forth between these palettes, having
then conveniently located is a boon.
3. Click the Duplicate Selected Frame button.
This button is located to the left of the Trash icon at the bottom of the
Animation palette.
Always add the new frame before changing the image appearance.
4. Change the appearance of the artwork.
Move a layer, show/hide a layer, change the layer style, or otherwise
alter the content of the image.
5. Repeat for each frame.
Add a new frame, change the appearance. Add a new frame, change the
appearance. Repeat as necessary until you have all the frames.
6. Adjust the timing of each frame.
Below each frame in the Animation palette, click the downward-pointing
triangle to assign timing — how long the frame is visible before the next
frame appears. You can click and Shift-click to select a series of frames
and assign the same timing to all of them at once.
7. Select a looping option.
In the lower-left corner of the Animation palette, decide whether you
want the animation to endlessly cycle, play only once, or play for a spe-
cific number of repetitions before stopping.
8. Save as GIF.
Use Photoshop’s Save for Web or ImageReady’s Optimize palette and
Save Optimized As command to create a GIF file. You don’t need to gen-
erate an HTML file; rather, just save the image itself.
Adding frames easily with tweening
Adding frame after frame to an animation can be tedious work. When your
animation includes a progression of movement or visibility, let the Animation
palette do most of the work for you. You create the first frame and the last,
and then use the Tween feature to create the intermediate frames.

In the example in Figure 17-13, I cre-
ated a two-layer image, with a cave
as the background and a skull as the
foreground. The first frame of the
animation shows the skull at the 
top of the cave. After clicking the
Duplicate Selected Frame button
(think of it as the New Frame
button), I dragged the upper layer
until the skull touched the top of 
the background. Next, I clicked the
Tween button (third from right at
the bottom of the Animation
palette), as shown at the bottom of
Figure 17-13.
Clicking the Tween button presents
me with the Tween dialog box, as
shown in Figure 17-14. Because this
simple animation involves only a
change in position (not opacity or
layer styles) and because the
moving element is rather large (for
the total image size), I elected to
enter 4 in the dialog box’s Frames to
Add text box. The four additional
frames are added to the existing
frames, giving the animation at this
point a total of six frames (see
Figure 17-14).
I added a new frame, moved the
skull to the far right, and then
tweened four more frames by
Option/Alt-clicking the Tween
button (which automatically applies
the last settings). After moving the
skull to the bottom, I added another
four frames with Tween. Finally, I
selected the frame showing the skull
at the bottom and the very first
frame and added the last four
frames. (Click the last frame, and
then Ô/Ctrl-click the first frame to
use Tween to finish a looping
sequence.) The final animation
shows the skull bouncing in a dia-
mond shape, as you can see in the
composited image in Figure 17-15.

your custom brushes, styles, and other such bits and pieces some-
where other than the Photoshop folder so you don’t lose them
should you ever need to reinstall the program. (Oops! I

Smoothing skin perfectly
When you see glamour shots — you know, photos of The Beautiful People
who look so absolutely perfect — one of the things you’re not seeing is the
texture of the skin. No wrinkles. No creases. No pores? Indeed, the skin
appears to be perfectly smooth (see Figure 18-1).

Figure 18-1: Use the Healing Brush and a plain-color source area to smooth skin.
Here’s how you can achieve that effect without blurring:
1. Open a copy of your image.
Whenever you use a technique that makes permanent changes to the
pixels in your image, you should work on a copy. That preserves the orig-
inal image, which not only protects you from any errors that you (or
Photoshop) might make but also keeps that original for different tech-
niques and tricks in the future. (Does that count as a tip?)
2. Add a new layer by clicking the New Layer button in the Layers
palette.
3. Make a selection.
The selection should be away from the face area, and sized at least one-
half the width and height of the face.

4. Fill the selection with color.
Press Option+Delete (Mac)/Alt+Backspace (Windows) to fill it with the
foreground color (it doesn’t matter what color); then deselect.
5. Select the Healing Brush and set the source point.
Make sure that the Use All Layers option is selected in the Options bar
and that Aligned is deselected. Option/Alt-click in the center of the filled
selection.
6. Paint over the skin.
Click and drag with the Healing Brush to smooth areas of skin. The
Healing Brush replaces the texture of the skin (pores and all) with the
texture of the source area (smooth). Use short strokes that follow the
contour of the face. Make sure that you don’t paint over eyebrows, nos-
trils, lips, and other areas of critical detail.
From a photo to a painting
You have dozens of ways to create a “painterly” effect in Photoshop. Here is
one of my favorites, as illustrated by Figure 18-2.
Figure 18-2: Blur shadows, sharpen highlights, and add texture for a “painterly” effect.
1. Open a copy of your image.
As always, because this technique makes changes to your pixels, work
on a copy of your image.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
2. Select the shadows and blur.
Open the Channels palette and Ô/Ctrl-click the channel at the top (RGB
or CMYK or Lab) to make a selection according to the brightness of each
pixel. Use the shortcut Ô+Shift+I/Ctrl+Shift+I to invert the selection
(select shadows rather than highlights). Apply a slight Gaussian Blur,
perhaps 1 or 2 pixels, to blur detail in the darker areas. (Remember that
you can use the shortcut Ô+H/Ctrl+H to hide the “marching ants” and
make the selection border disappear — and that’s not a tip!)
3. Select the highlights and sharpen.
Use the shortcut Ô+Shift+I/Ctrl+Shift+I to again invert the selection
(again selecting the highlights). Apply the Sharpen➪Smart Sharpen filter
with initial settings of Amount: 200% and Radius: 2 pixels. (Adjust the
values to match the content of your image and your artistic vision.)
4. Add a canvas texture to the image.
Deselect with the shortcut Ô+D/Ctrl+D (so that the texture is applied to
the whole image), then use the Texture➪Texturizer filter to add a slight
canvas texture, enhancing the “painterly” effect.
Creating a sketch from a photo
Simulating a painting in Photoshop is great, but sometimes you might need
line art or a sketch. Photoshop has a couple of filters that do a nice job of cre-
ating pencil sketches, but none of them really do a great job with outlines.
Here’s an easy way to create line art from a photo (see Figure 18-3).
1. Open a copy of your image.
Again, this is a destructive technique — it makes permanent changes to
the pixels in the file — so work from a copy to play it safe.
2. Apply the Smart Blur filter.
Set the filter to Quality: High and Mode: Normal, and use settings that
remove all the tiny detail in your image (such as pores and individual
hairs or blades of grass) but maintain edges and major detail (such as
eyes, noses, golf balls, and trees).
3. Define edges with Smart Blur.
Reopen the Smart Blur dialog box and set the Mode pop-up menu to
Edge Only. Adjust the sliders until the white-on-black preview shows
approximately the amount of detail you want in the final image; then
click OK.

4. Invert the colors.
Use the shortcut Ô+I/Ctrl+I to
swap black and white in the
image.
5. Blur the lines.
Apply a 1- or 2-pixel Gaussian
Blur to soften the edges of the
lines.
6. Adjust the thickness of the 
lines with Levels.
In the Levels dialog box, drag 
the middle slider control left 
and right until you’re satisfied
with the image’s appearance. 
If desired, you can further 
refine the sketch with the
Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask filter.
Creating snow or rain
Here’s a multi-use technique that you can use to create falling snow or rain
(as shown in Figure 18-4):
1. Add a new layer to your image by clicking the New Layer button in
the Layers palette.
2. Still in the Layers palette, change the layer’s blending mode from
Normal to Screen.
The Screen blending mode makes the layer appear to be empty.
Because this technique uses a separate layer, consider it to be non-
destructive (you can always delete the layer later), so you don’t have to
work on a copy of your image.
3. Use the Edit➪Fill command to fill the layer with black.
4. Add Noise to the layer.
Use the Noise➪Add Noise filter to add some variation to the layer. Use
Amount: 20%, Distribution: Gaussian, and mark the Monochromatic
check box.
5. Crystallize the noise.
Use the Pixelate➪Crystallize filter to turn the little noise into larger
chunks. Use Cell Size: 3 for small snow or rain; try 7 or 10 for larger
flakes. You can also apply a slight Gaussian Blur to increase the size.

Figure 18-3: You can use the versatile Smart
Blur filter to produce line art from a photo.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
6. Sharpen the edges.
Using the Unsharp Mask filter,
sharpen until the snowflakes
have distinct edges. Use 
Amount: 100%, Radius: 2,
Threshold: 0. When you 
create rain, use Amount: 40%.
7. Apply a Levels adjustment.
In the Levels dialog box, drag the
middle slider about halfway to
the left; then drag the left slider
slowly to the right until you see
the amount of snow or rain that
you want. Afterward, if desired,
you can apply the Motion Blur
filter to the falling snow/rain. And, of course, you can add a layer mask
to control visibility.
The Glass Text effect
Perfect for adding a large copyright notice right across the center of your
image (while allowing the image’s beauty to still show through), this tech-
nique is so easy it doesn’t even need a step-by-step explanation. Simply type
your copyright info (or any other text), and add a Bevel and Emboss layer
style (perhaps with a slight Inner Shadow and maybe a 1-pixel black Stroke
effect). Then, at the top of the Layers palette, reduce the Fill slider (not the
Opacity slider) to 0 (zero). The pixels on the layer become transparent, but
the layer style remains visible.
Useful Tricks to Make Life Easier
Here are five techniques that make life easier and your work look snappier
and more professional.
Changing product colors in a snap
Use Photoshop’s Replace Color feature (in the Image➪Adjustments menu) to
quickly and easily make variations of a single image by changing color.
Replace Color is especially handy in production environments, letting you
shoot one shot and produce numerous color variations. (See Figure 18-5.)
Figure 18-4: Use the Noise and Crystallize
filters to produce snow or rain.

Open Replace Color and Shift-drag 
the Eyedropper tool through the 
color you want to change. Adjust 
the Fuzziness slider to fine-tune 
the selection; then adjust the Hue/
Saturation and Lightness sliders to
change the color.
If the target color appears in more
than one part of the image, perhaps a
red blouse and red lipstick, make a
loose selection around the area you
want to change (excluding the other
areas) before opening Replace Color.
Deleting a plain white background
Lots of stock photography comes as a subject shot against a plain white
background. Clip art also generally comes on a plain white background. Most
of these images have clipping paths or alpha channels that you can use to
extract the subject from the background to add it to another image. And
when there is no path or channel? Open both images in Photoshop and drag
the stock photo’s Background layer from the Layers palette to the window of
the destination image. Make sure that the upper layer is active in the Layers
palette and then open the Blending Options panel of the Layer Style dialog
box. In the Blend If area at the bottom, drag the upper-right slider handle to
the left until the upper layer’s white background is completely gone. (See
Figure 18-6.)

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Making dashed and dotted lines
Changing a couple of settings in Photoshop’s Brushes palette enables you to
create dashed and dotted lines with ease. In the Brush Tip Shape pane,
increase Spacing to a value higher than 100% to separate the individual
imprints of the brush tip (the brush tip instances). Switch to the Shape
Dynamics pane and select Direction from the Angle Jitter pop-up menu. For
best results, make a selection and use the Edit➪Stroke command to apply
your dotted or dashed brush along the selection border.
Quick and easy edge effects
Need some way to make your images stand out? Try this:
1. Add a new layer to your image by clicking the New Layer button in
the Layers palette.
To avoid making any permanent change to your image (primarily so you
can change your mind about the border later), work on a new layer.
2. Select a border area around the image.
Use the Select➪All command, followed by the Select➪Modify➪Border
command. Enter a value twice the width that you want for your edge
effect.
3. Fill the selection with black, gray, or white.
• Black: Makes your image look brighter and more saturated
• Gray: Minimizes any perceived color shift
• White: Mutes the image somewhat but allows it to stand on its own
Alternatively, use any color from the image (or its inverse).
4. Apply filters to the layer.
Open the Filter Gallery and apply one or more filters to the border to
create an interesting edge effect (such as the samples in Figure 18-7).
Professional-looking contact sheets
You can use this trick to produce a more traditional-looking contact sheet
with a black background and white type:
1. Set up Contact Sheet II.
Use the File➪Automate➪Contact Sheet II command to open the dialog
box. Select your source folder, make decisions on page size and layout,
pick a font for the filenames, and so on.

Figure 18-7: Filtering a border area creates interesting edge effects for your images.
2. Clear the Flatten All Layers check box.
Before running Contact Sheet II, make sure you clear this check box to
ensure that your contact sheet retains its layers.
3. Generate the contact sheets.
Select your page size, source folder, and other settings as I describe in
Chapter 16. Click OK.
4. Fill the Background layer with black.
In the Layers palette, select the layer named Background, press D 
to set your foreground color to black, and then press Option+Delete/
Alt+Backspace to fill the layer with black.
5. Change the type to white.
In the Layers palette, Ô/Ctrl-click each of the type layers to select them
all, click the Link Layers button at the bottom of the Layers palette, and
then Shift-click the color swatch in the Character palette to open the
Color Picker. Set the color to white (or bright yellow or whatever color
suits your fancy) and then click OK. You can now flatten the image (if
desired).

Ten Extras You Should Consider
In This Chapter
 Discovering equipment to add to your wish list
 Checking out software to complement Photoshop
A
lthough Photoshop CS2 is indeed a dandy product all by itself, it doesn’t
have to live in a vacuum. Hundreds of pieces of hardware and software
are available to make working with Photoshop faster, easier, and even per-
haps more profitable. (As your birthday approaches, please feel free to leave
this book open to this chapter in some conspicuous place around the house
or office, perhaps with some great big red circles and arrows.)
After all, there are goodies, and then there are goodies! Of the many, many acces-
sories available for Photoshop, these are the ones that I put at the top of my list.
New Toys: Hardware
Unpack it. Hook it up. Plug it in. Screw it down. Drag it around.
Hardware accessories come in a lot of shapes, sizes, and price
ranges. Assuming that you have a limited budget or cash
flow, here’s how I suggest you prioritize your wish list:
 RAM: Photoshop CS2 can recognize some 4GB
of RAM (computer memory). If you work with
large images or multiple images — especially
if you apply complex filters — add more 
RAM to work faster and more efficiently.
Online retailers like Crucial Technology
(www.crucial.com) can help you choose the
correct memory chips for your computer. And
make sure you get the right chips!
 Wacom tablet: A pressure-sensitive drawing tablet is
great for more than painting. Tracing an outline with the
Magnetic Lasso using a mouse can be tough, as can creating a complex
layer mask with the Brush tool. A Wacom tablet lets you use a pen-like

368
Part V: The Part of Tens
stylus instead of a mouse. The Wacom site (www.wacom.com) has a
Tablet Wizard to help you choose the correct tablet for your needs. My
tip: If you’re a traditionally trained artist, you likely use longer strokes
and will be happier with a larger tablet. Likewise, if you have a huge
monitor, get a big tablet. Otherwise, a 6 x 8" Intuos3 is great.
 Tripod: Photographers (digital or film) need a good, strong, steady
tripod. You might be surprised by the amount of time you save retouch-
ing photos shot with a camera that’s perfectly steady. And to help pre-
vent exposure tremors even more, get a cable release or wireless control
for your camera, too!
 Second monitor: With a second video card (or a dual-head video card),
you can hook up a second monitor that extends the work area (not just
for Photoshop) across both screens. Mac users use the two monitors as
a single workspace, and Windows users can move palettes to the second
monitor but not image windows.
 Large(r) format printer: An 8 x 10" photo is great, but sometime a 
13 x 19" print is much more powerful (and sells at a better price, too). 
If your inkjet doesn’t print on paper larger than letter size, consider
investing in a printer that does. Take a look at Epson online
(www.epson.com) for the latest models.
Extra Capabilities: Software
There are some things that Photoshop does well that additional software
does, well, better. Here are five great ways to make Photoshop work better:
 Masking software: Fly-away hair, glass, shadows . . . lots of very tough
selection and masking challenges face you. Mask Pro from Extensis
(www.extensis.com) and KnockOut from Corel (www.corel.com) are
both excellent.
 Fonts: Sure, you have the various fonts installed with your operating
system and on various programs, but more can be better! Check out
Chank! (www.chank.com), Fonthead Design (www.fonthead.com),
Fonts.com (www.fonts.com), and Adobe (www.adobe.com).
 nik Color Efex Pro: An amazing product, Color Efex from nik multimedia
(www.nikmultimedia.com) maintains relationships among colors while
enhancing your image.
 nik Sharpener Pro: Another great product from nik multimedia,
Sharpener Pro takes the guesswork out of sharpening your image. Your
image is analyzed and evaluated for its content, color, resolution, and
destination.
 Scaling software: If you want to make large prints, perhaps poster size
or larger, consider either pxl SmartScale (www.extensis.com) or
Genuine Fractals (www.genuinefractals.com).

Ten Reasons to Own 
a Digital Camera
In This Chapter
 Five professional-life reasons to go digital
 Four personal-life reasons to go digital
 One good-for-the-future-of-the-planet reason to go digital
I
t’s hard to pick just ten reasons to own and use a digital camera. In an
effort to play heartstrings everywhere, I’ve included ideas about job-
related shooting, uses in the home, travel considerations . . . the list goes on
and on, but only up to ten. After that, you have to use your imagination.
Ten Reasons You Should Shoot Pixels
The gap in capability between 35mm film and high-end 
digital cameras disappeared some time ago. The tech-
nology that allows digital cameras to match 35mm qual-
ity is now found in quite reasonably priced equipment.
(Admittedly, only the most expensive digital camera
backs can even think about competing with medium
or large format film.) If you haven’t yet gone over to
the digital side, here are some convincing arguments
to make the jump. If you already are digital in mind,
body, and lens, read the list anyway — it might give you
a few points for future discussions with traditionalists.
Shooting digital for your work
In the field, in the studio, and even in the home and on the road, dig-
ital offers a number of advantages over film.

370
Part V: The Part of Tens
 No processing time (or cost): You don’t wait to start editing your images
because you download to your computer and open the images in
Photoshop. No longer do you have those pesky delays for
processing/printing/scanning. (And no bills for film processing.)
 Instant feedback: You can evaluate the shot immediately on the
camera’s LCD screen, which allows you to quickly delete any boo-boos
before anyone else sees them. Oh, and that frees up storage space, too,
of course! (And don’t forget about LCD previews available on many cam-
eras, and operating your camera from the computer, which let you
makes decisions even before you shoot.)
 Create libraries of textures and patterns: Shoot digital images of clouds
and bark and grass and fabric and concrete and bricks and whatever to
create libraries of textures to use in Photoshop.
 Remote control: Use your computer’s monitor (if your camera/software
allows) to adjust and perfect the shot before shooting. The screen is a
lot larger and more accurate than the camera’s LCD.
 Multiple exposures for one image: Bracket the exposure, and then com-
bine the images automatically in Photoshop with Merge to HDR.
Shooting digital for yourself
Owning a digital camera comes in handy for your personal life, too.
 Travel convenience: With a digital, you eliminate worries about x-ray
machines, baggage scanning, and film storage. And don’t forget how much
easier it is to carry a half-dozen Flash cards than dozens of rolls of film!
 Home inventory: Do it. Really. Do it. Go around the house and take
photos of the important stuff. (Don’t forget the jewelry!) If your camera
has a date/time stamp, use it. You don’t even need to print these shots.
Just drop that Flash card (or whatever storage device your camera uses)
in the safe deposit box at the bank. Or mail it to your family attorney. Or
put it in an envelope at the office. But have it safe, just in case Mother
Nature (or Human Nature) requires you to file an insurance claim.
 Family gatherings: Hey, aren’t you the Photoshop expert? Doesn’t that
make you the perfect person to take this group photo? (Read about
instant feedback in the preceding section.)
 Explore your artistic boundaries: It really doesn’t cost anything (dollar-
wise) to shoot digitally. Take the off-angle shot. Play with aperture and
exposure. Have fun, play, experiment, and learn. And see what you really
have inside you.

Shooting digital for the rest of us
Digital photography is so much more environmentally friendly than film that
it boggles the mind! No toxic waste related to film production. No processing
chemicals to dispose of (or illegally dump down the sink). Really, truly, a
more Earth-friendly way to shoot. And isn’t that a nice thought with which to
end this book?
We wish you peace, love, health, and happiness!
