PREFACE 
This book covers six aspects of graduate school mathematics: Algebra, 
Topology, Differential Geometry, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis and Par- 
tial Differential Equations. It contains a selection of more than 500 problems 
and solutions based on the Ph.D. qualifying test papers of a decade of in- 
fluential universities in North America. The mathematical problems under 
discussion are kept within the scope of the textbooks for graduate students. 
Finding solutions to these problems, however, involves a deep understanding 
of mathematical principles as well as an acquisition of skills in analysis and 
computation. As a supplement to textbooks, this book may prove to be of 
some help to the students in taking relevant courses. It may also serve as a 
reference book for the teachers concerned. 
It has to be pointed out that this book should not be regarded as an all- 
purpose troubleshooter. Nor is it advisable to take the book as an exemplary 
text and commit to memory all the problems and solutions and make an indis- 
criminate use of them. Instead, the students are expected to make a selective 
survey of the problems, take a do-it-yourself approach and arrive at their own 
solutions which they may check against those listed in the book. It would be 
gratifying to see that the students can work out the problems on their own and 
come up with better solutions than those provided by the book. If the students 
fail to do so or their solutions may turn out to be incomplete, it may reveal 
the inadequacy of their knowledge or approach, thus spurring them to greater 
efforts to promote their skills. The very purpose of the authors in writing the 
book is just to help the students to discover the truth by trial and error. 
This book was inspired by Professor K. K. Phua’s proposals. We are par- 
ticularly grateful to him for his support. We also wish to thank Dr. Xu Pei- 
jun, Professors Zhang Yin-nan, Hong Jia-Xing and Chen Xiao-man for their 
painstaking efforts to collect test-oriented data. For selecting problems and 
providing solutions, we wish to acknowledge the following professors respec- 
tively: Wu Quan-shui (Part I), Pan Yang-lian (Part II), Jiang Guo-ying (Part 

vi 
111), Tong Yu-sun, Xu Sheng-zhi (Part IV), Chen Ji-xiu (Part V) and &in 
Tie-hu (Part VI). We are also indebted to Professor Guo Yu-tao for carefully 
reading and correcting the manuscript. Finally, we pay tribute to Dr. Cai 
Zhi-jie for printing out the manuscript.

Linear Algebra

Let V be a real vector space of dimension at least 3 and let T E Endn(V). 
Prove that there is a non-zero subspace W of V ,  W # V ,  such that T(W) C W .  
Solution, 
(Indian 
u) 
Make V into an B[X]-module by defining 
w = T ( v )  for all w E V .  Thus 
for 
a,Xi E B[X] and v E V 
i=O 
It is clear that a subspace W of V is an B[X]-submodule of V if and only if 
Now suppose V is a simple IR[X]-module. Then V E E[X]/I for some 
maximal ideal of B[X]. Since R [ X ]  is a P.I.D., there exists an irreducible 
polynomial f(X) of B[X] such that I = (f(X)). So 
T( W )  c W .  
3 5 dimR(V) = dimnR[X]/(f(X)) = degf(X). 
This implies that we have an irreducible polynomial f ( A )  with degree 2 3 in 
B[X]. This is a contradiction. Hence V is not a simple B(X)-module, that is, 
there is a non-zero subspace W of V ,  W # V ,  such that T ( W )  W .  
1102 
Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over a field K .  
Let S be a linear transformation of V into itself. Let W be an invariant 
subspace of V (that is, SW C W ) .  Let m(t), ml(t), and rnz(t) be the minimal 
polynomial of S as linear transformation of V, W and V/W respectively. 
(a) Prove that m(t) divides ml(t) . r n 2 ( t ) .  

4 
(b) Prove that if ml(t) and mZ(t) are relatively prime, then 
m(t) = m1(t) 
* m2(t). 
(c) Give an example of a case in which m(t) # ml(t) . mz(t). 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
As usual, T/ can be viewed as a K[t]-module via the linear transformation 
S. Since W is an S-invariant subspace of V, W is a K[t]-submodule of V. 
Then it is clear that (m(t)) = Ann~plV’, 
(ml(t)) = A n n ~ p l W  and (m2(t)) = 
A%[t] V l  W . 
(a) Since 
m1(t) . m2(t) . v c m1(t) . W = 0, 
~ ( t )  
m ( t )  E A n n ~ p l V  = (m(t)). 
Hence m(t) divides ml(t) m2(t). 
(b) Since 
m(t) E AnnK[t]V G AnnK[t]W = (m1(t>), 
rnl(t) divides m(t). Similarly, m2(t) divides m(t). Since ml(t) and mz(t) are 
relatively prime, ml(t).m2(t) divides m(t). Then we have m(t) = ml(t).m2(t), 
since m(t), ml(t) and mz(t) are all monic polynomials. 
(c) Let W be a 2-dimensional vector space over the field Q of rational 
numbers and S : W -+ W be a linear transformation with minimal polynomial 
t2 + 1. Let V = W @ W and S : V --t V be the natural extenaion of S to V. 
Then it is clear that m(t) = ml(t) = m2(t) = t2 + 1. So m(t) # ml(t) 
* m2(t) 
in this example. 
1103 
Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over lR and T : V -+ V be a 
linear transformation such that (a) the minimal polynomial of T is irreducible 
and (b) there exists a vector u E V such that {Tiv I i 2 0) spans V. Show 
that V doesn’t have proper T-invariant subspace. 
Solution. 
V can be viewed as a module over the polynomial ring l R [ X ]  via f ( X )  . z  = 
f ( T )  
3 (x), for any f(A) E lR[X] and z E V. Then we have V = lR[X] . v ,  a 
cyclic module, since {Taw I i 2 0) spans V by (b). Let m(X) be the minimal 
(In d i m  a) 

5 
polynomial of the linear transformation T : V -+ V .  Then m(A) E Annwfxl(v). 
Since m(A) is irreducible, we have 
R[X]/(m(A)) 
E R[A] * 21 = v 
(we may assume that V # 0). So V is an irreducible R[A]-module. Thus, V 
does not have proper T-invariant subspace. 
1104 
Let A be an n x n matrix with entries in C. Show that A has n distinct 
eigenvalues in C if and only if A commutes with no nonzero nilpotent matrix. 
Solution. 
Then there exists an invertible n x n matrix P such that 
(Inddana) 
Necessity. Suppose that A has n distinct eigenvalues A', Xa,. . . , A, 
in C. 
PAP-' = diag{ A1, . . . , An}. 
If A commutes with some nilpotent matrix B ,  we have to show B = 0. Since 
All Az,. . , A, 
are distinct and 
PAP-' = diag{X1,...,Xn) 
commutes with P-'BP, P-lBP is a diagonal matrix. But the nilpontency of 
B implies that P ' B P  is nilpotent. Hence we have P-'BP = 0. So B = 0. 
Sufficiency. Suppose that the characteristic polynomial of A has multiple 
roots. We have to show that A commutes with some nonzero nilpotent matrix. 
Let diag(J1, Jz,.. . , J t )  be the Jordan canonical form of A and 
PAP-' = diag(J1, Jz , . . . , Jt), 
where P is an n x n invertible matrix and J, is a Jordan block of order ei. 
Without loss of generality, we may assume that el > 1 (If all the ei = 1, then 
it is easy to see that A commutes with some nonzero nilpotent matrix). 
Let B1 be the Jordan block of order el, with 0 on the diagonal. Then 
JIB' = BIJl and Bl(# 
0 )  is nilpotent. Let 
B' = diag(B1, Bz,. . . , B,) 
where Bi(i 2 
2) = 0 E Me; (C). Then 
B' . PAP-' = PAP-l . B'. 
Taking B = P-lB'P, we have B # 0, which is nilpotent, and AB = BA.

1105 
Suppose V is a finite dimensional vector space over a field K ,  T : V -+ 
V a linear map such that the minimal polynomial of T coincides with the 
characteristic polynomial, which is the square of an irreducible polynomial in 
K[T]. Show that if %',T and 3 
are any three non-zero vectors in V ,  then at 
least two of the three subspaces spaned by the sets (T*-?it}z>~, 
- {Ta?},20 and 
{ T Z 3 } r > 0  
- coincide. 
Solution. 
V can be viewed as a module over the polynomial ring F[X] simply by 
f(X).z = f(T).(z) 
for any z E V ,  f(A) 6 F[X]. Let {U~,U~,...,U,} 
be a base 
of V over F ,  A = ( u ~ ~ ) , ~ ~  
be the matrix of T relative to the base. In general, 
a normal form for X I  - A in M,(F[X]) has the form 
(Stanford) 
diag{l,. . . , l,dl(X), . . 
+ ,d,(X)} 
where the d,(X) are monic of positive degree and d,(X)(d,(X) if i 5 j. By 
the structure theory of finite generated modules over P.I.D., there exist z,(z = 
1,2, ..., s )  E V such that V = F [ X ] . z l $ F [ X ] . z z ~ . . . ~ F [ X ] . z ,  
where Ann(z,) = 
(d*(X)). Here, according to the assumptions, the minimal polynomial m(X) of 
T is det(X1 - A ) ,  so 
m(X) = d,(X) = det(X1- A). 
Hence s = 1 and 
v = F[X] 
f z1 E?! F[X]/(m(X)) 
is cyclic. Since m(X) is the square of some irreducible polynomial, V = F[X].zl 
has exactly two non-zero submodules. Obviously, the three subspaces gener- 
ated by the sets {T'Z'},>o, {TET}I>~ 
- and {T*8},>o 
are non-zero submodules 
of V over F[X]. So at least two of them coincide. 
1106 
Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over 
with basis {wl,. . . , vn}. 
Let CT be a permutation on {q, 
. . . , v,} and thus induce a linear transformation 
A on V .  Show that A is diagonalizable. 
(HU7Wrd) 

7 
Solution. 
By re-ordering the elements 211, 'u2, 
* . , 'u,, 
we assume that 
when u is expressed as the product of disjoint cycles (This decomposition may 
have 1-cycles). Let Wj be the subspace of V generated by {Kj-l 
+ 1,. . , vij} 
for j = 1,2, - .  - , s + 1 (io = 0, is+l = n). Then the Wj are invariant subspaces 
of A and V = W1 @ W2 @ ... @ Ws+l. 
Let Mj be the matrix of Alwj : 
Wi -+ Wj relative to the base { ~ i ~ - ~ + 1 , . . - , v i ~ }  
of Wj overt. Then M = 
diag{M1,...,Ms+l} is the matrix of A relative to the base ( V ~ , V ~ , ~ ~ ~ , V , } .  
So 
it suffices to prove that every Mi is diagonalizable. 
Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume that CJ is the n-cycle 
(v1,w2,..-,wn). The matrix of A relative to the base { V ~ , V ~ , ~ ~ . , V , )  
is 
M =

It is easy to see that the minimal polynomial of M is A" - 1, and thus M is 
diagonaliz able. 
This completes the proof that A is diagonalizable. 
1107 
Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over the field of rational numbers. 
Suppose T is a non-singular linear transformation of V such that T-' = T2+T. 
Prove that 3 divides the dimension of V, and prove that if dimV = 3, then all 
such T's are similar. 
Solution. 
Since T-' = T2 + T, T is annihilated by the polynomial X3 + X2 - 1. 
Obviously, X3 + X2 - 1 is irreducible over the field Q of rational numbers. Thus 
X3 + X2 - 1 is the minimal polynomial m(X) of T. 
Now let n be the dimension of V over Q, A be the matrix of T relative to 
some base of V ,  diag{l,..-, l,dl(X),.--,d,(X)} be the normal form for X I - A  
( H U 7 V d )

where the &(A) 
are monk of positive degree and di(X)ldj(X) if i 5 j. By the 
irreduciblity of &(A) 
= m(X) = X3 + X2 - 1, we have 
&(A) 
= &(A) 
= . . . = &(A) = X3 + X2 - 1. 
Since det(X1- A) = dl(X)...d,(X), 
3 .  s = deg(det(XI - A)) = n. 
Thus we have proved that 3 divides the dimension of V .  
If dimV = 3, then X I  - A is equivalent to diag(1, 1, X3 + X2 - 1). The 
. It follows that all the 
rational canonical form for A (or 7') is 
T's are similar when dimV = 3. 
1108 
Let Fq be a finite field with q = p" elements, where p is a prime. Let 
11 : Fq -+ Fq be the Frobenius automorphism II(z) = z p .  Prove that II 
considered as a linear map over Fp is diagonalizable if and only if n divides 
p" - 1. (Here is a misprint. It should be "n divides p -  l".) 
Solution. 
(Hurvard) 
It is wellknown that Fp C Fq is a Galois extension with 
Gal(Fq/Fp) = {1,11,112,...,IIn-1}. 
By the Normal Base Theorem, there exists a u E Fp such that {u, 
II(u), I12(u), 
... , II"-l(u)} is a base for Fq over Fp. When II is considered as a linear map of 
Fq over Fp, the matrix of 11 relative to the base {u,

The normal form for XE - M is diag{ 1,. . . , 1, A" - 1) and the minimal poly- 
nomial m(X) of M is A" - 1 = det(XE - M ) .  
Suppose that 11 is diagonalizable as a linear map over Fp. Then m(X) = 
A" - 1 has no multiple root, and all the roots of A" - 1 are in Fp. On the other 

9 
hand, all the root of An - 1 forms a subgroup of FJ = Fp\{O}. Thus n divides 
p -  1. 
Conversely, if n divides p - 1, A" - 1 has no multiple root and 
A" - 1 = (A - 1) . (A - ad)(.\ - a 2 d ) .  ..(A - a("-l)d) 
where d = 
and a is the generator of the group F;. Hence M is similar 
to diag{ 1, ad, . . . , u ( ~ - ' ) ~ }  in Mn(Fp). So IT is diagonalizable as a linear map 
over Fp.

Let A(t) be a non-singular matrix r.Lli)se elements are differentiable func-

(a) A direct verification shows that (a) is true. 
(b) Since zTAz 5 0 for all z E lR9 and zTAz = 0 if and only if z = 0, all 
the eigenvalues of A are negative.

yTBy = a?A1 + u; * A2 2 0. 
Since 
dim V1+ dim Vz = 9 + 2 = 11 > 10, 
there exists 0 # y E V1 n VZ. Then we have yTBy < 0 (y # 0, y E V1) and 
yTBy 2 0 (y E VZ), a contradiction. Thus B has 9 negative eigenvalues.

Now suppose ( I -  P).u

We must have u = 0. The matrix I - P is therefore invertible, and we can 
write ( I  - P)-' = I + P(I - P)-'. Then we have

Then A = I - N .  So

Let G be a pgroup and G x V + V be a linear action of G on a finite 
vector space over a finite field Fan. Using Sylow theory, prove that there exist 
a basis of V in which all the transformation v + a .  v(a E G) are unipotent

Solution. 
Let 
( CoZumbia) 
G' = {V + V, w --+ 0 * 01g E G}. 
Then G' is a pgroup, since there is a surjective homomorphism G -+ G' 
( 5  EndF(V)). We fix a base of V over Fan. Then G' is isomorphic to a 
subgroup H of GL(m, Fan), where m = dirnp,, V .  
It is well known that

Let S be an endomorphism of a finite dimensional vector space V over a 
field F whose characteristic polynomial is not equal to its minimal polynomial. 
Show that there is an endomorphism T of V so that T commutes with S but T is 
not a polynomial in S (T is a polynomial in S if T = aol+alS+a2S2+. . .+akSk 
for some k and ai E F.) 
Solution. 
Let 
(Stunfod) 
F[S] = {f(S) : V --t V I f(X) E F[X]}. 
Then as F-vector space, dimF F[S] = degrn(X), where r n ( A )  is the minimal 
polynomial of S. Since the minimal polynomial of S is not equal to its char- 
acteristic polynomial, dimF F[S] < dimF v. 
On the other hand, let dl(X), &(A), 
.. . ,&(A) 
be the invariant factors # 1 
of S and let ni = degdi(X), then by Frobenius theorem, the dimension of the 
vector spcae over F of matrices commutative with the matrix of S is

d) Show that g E G has ppower order iff g = I + N with N n  = 0. 
e) Show that G contains elements of order qn - 1 
Hint. Make use of Fqn. 
(Columbia) 
Solution. 
a) When forming a matrix in GLn(Fq), we may choose the first row in 
qn - 1 ways (a row of zeros not being allowed), the second row in qn - q ways 
(no multiple of the first row being allowed), the third row in qn - q2 ways (no 
linear combination of the first two rows being allowed), and so on. Thus we 
can conclude that the order of GL,(Fq) is 

30 
When forming a matrix in Un(Fq), we may choose the first row in qn-l 
ways, the second row in qnP2 ways: the third rows in qn-3 ways and so on. 
Hence the order of Un(Fq) is 
SO U = Un(Fq) is a psubgroup of G = GLn(Fq). Since p j [G : U ]  = 
n n 
(P'~ - l ) ,  U is a Sylow psubgroup of G. 
i = l  
b) It follows directly from Sylow's Theorem. 
c) By Sylow's Theorem, the number of G-conjugates of U is equal to [G : 
NG(U)] where N G ( U )  is the normalizer of U in G. 
n, there exists some

such that g(I + Ejj) = u g  where Eij is the matrix with a lone 1 in the (i,j) 
place, 0's elsewhere. Checking the last row of g ( l + E i j )  and u g ,  we get gni = 0. 
So gn, = 0 if i < TI. Then checking the (n - 1)th row, we get gn-l,j = 0 if 
i < n - 1. By this way, we get gij = 0 if i > j. Hence g E T = Tn(Fq), the set 
of matrices (aij) E G with a;j = 0 (0 5 j < i 5 n). 
Conversely, if g E T: It is easy to see that gUg-' & U (by matrix multi- 
plication). So g

We can define a map 19 : T + F; x ... x F; by mapping a matrix onto its 
principal diagonal, matrix multiplication shows that 0 is a group epimorphism 
whose kernel is precisely U = Un(Fq). So the order of T is 
n 
i = l  
Hence the number of G-conjugates of U is n (qi - l ) / ( q  - l)n. 
d) Suppose g E G has ppower order. Then ( 9 )  is a psubgroup and (9) 
is conjugate to a subgroup of U by b). There exists an h E G such that 
h g h - l  E U .  Denote h g h - l  = I + M where M is a matrix with zero on and 
below the diagonal. Obviously Mn = 0 and g = I + h - lM h  = I + N where 
N = h - l M h  and N" = h-lM"h = 0. 

31 
[GI = U gHg-' 
IgEG 
Conversely, if g = I + N with N" = 0, the Jordan canonical form for N is 
a matrix with zero on and below the diagenal. Thus g is similar (conjugate) 
to some matrix in U .  So the order of g is ppower. 
e) Consider the finite field Fqn as an extension of the field Fq and as a vector 
space over Fq. For any a(# 0) E Fqn, we have a linear map al : Fqn --f FqR, 
al(z) = az (over Fq) which is invertible. We fix a base of Fqn over Fq, then 
we can obtain a group homomorphism (T : FLf. --$ G = Gn(Fq), ~ ( u )  
= at. 
Obviously, (T is injective. It is well known that F;,, has an element with order 
q" - 1. It follows that G contains element of order q" - 1.

(b) First we claim that G is cyclic. Suppose that G is not cyclic. Then for 
any a E G, (a) < G. So (a) is contained in some maximal subgroup of G (since 
G is finite). Let H be a maximal subgroup of G. Then we have G = U gHg-l 
U E G  
by assumption. By (a) G = H .  This contradicts the maximality o f k .  Hence 
G is cyclic. Now, it is easy to see that G is cyclic of prime power order since 
all of its maximal subgroup are conjugate.

(finite index) then there exists a homomorphism of G/HG into S[G:XI, 
where 
S, denotes the symmetric group on n letters. 
Solution. 
Let H be any subgroup of G such that [G : H] = n. Then GxGIH + G / H ,  
g . ( z H )  = (gx) . H defines an action of G on GIH, where GIH denotes the 
set of all left cosets z H ( z  E G). The kernel of this action is HG = n g-lHg. 
Hence the group GIHG is isomorphic to a subgroup of S, , the symmetric group 
on n letters. This induces a homomorphism G + S, with HG as its kernel. 
Since G is finite generated, there are only finite number of homomorphisms 
from G to S,. It follows that the set 
g € G  
( Co2umbia) 
g € G  
{HGIH < G, [G : H ]  = n} 
is finite. Since G/HG is finite, G/HG has only finitely many subgroups of 
index n. Thus G has only finitely many subgroups of index n.

Solution. 
(a) Let T E G and f ( X )  be the minimal polynomial of T over Fp. Then X 
1 f ( X ) .  If T is semisimple, that is, f(X) is separable (remark: here separability 
means that f(X) has no multiple roots), then f ( X )  = f l ( X ) f 2 ( X ) - - . f k ( X )  for 
some distinct irreducible polynomials fi ( 1  5 i 5 k). Denote ni = degfi(X) 
and m = n1 . n2 
'nk. Let E be a splitting subfield of XPm - X over Fp and 
Ei = Fp[X]/(fi(X)) 
( 1  5 i 5 k ) .  Then IEl = p" 
and Ei is a field of order 
pni. Since nilm, E, is isomorphic to a subfield of E. So E contains an element 
~i whose minimal polynomial over Fp is f i ( x ) .  Since ~i # 0 and 7.frn-l = 1, 
f i ( A ) ~ ( A P r n - l - l ) ,  ( 1  5 i 5 k). Hence f(X) = fl(X).fi(X)...fi~(X)I(X~~-~-l) 
. 
Thus Tprn-l = 1.

Next suppose TPm-' = 1 for some positive integer m. Then f(X)I(P"'-'

n n-1 
= p-

U is a Sylow psubgroup of G. 
Now let H be a subgroup of G of order a power of p. By Sylow's Theorem, 
H is contained in some Sylow psubgroup K of G and K is conjugate to U .  
Hence there exists an element g in G such that gHg-l 5 gKg-' = U. Thus 
we have proved that H can be simultaneously upper triangularized.

Let p and q be distinct prime numbers. Let G be a group of order p3. q such 
that its commutator subgroup K is of order q. Let H be a pSylow subgroup 
of G. 
(a) Show that H is abelian and G = H K .  
(b) Show that there are elements h E H and k 6 K such that hk # kh. 
(c) From (b) show that p divides q - 1. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) Since K is the commutator subgroup of G. K is normal in G and G / K  
is abelian. So H - K = K H  is a subgroup of G. Since IK( = q, IHJ = p3, 
H n K = { e }  and lHKl = p3 q = IGI. Hence G = H K  and H 21 H / ( e )  = 
H / H  n K 21 HKIK E G / K  is abelian. 
(b) Suppose that for any elements h E H and k E K holds hk = kh. Since 
K is abelian and H is abelian, G = H K  is abelian. This contradicts the fact 
that the commutator subgroup K of G is of order q. This proves (b). 
(c) First we claim that H is not normal in G. Otherwise, for any h E H 
and k E K ,  hkh-lk-l E H n K = {e} and so hk = kh. By Sylow Theorem,

the number of pSylow subgroups of G is greater than 1 and divides q. So it is

(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) Let rp be the number of Sylow psubgroups of G. Then, by Sylow’s 
Theorem, rP lqz and plrp - 1. Since p, q are primes and p > q > 2, it is easy to 
see that rp = 1. So G has only one Sylow psubgroup H ,  which is normal in 
G and of order p. By Cauchy’s Theorem, G also contains an element of order 
q. So G has a subgroup K of order q. Thus H . K is a subgroup of order p . q 
since H is normal in G. 
(b) If q = 2, G may not contain a subgroup of order p . q .  For example, Aq, 
the alternating group of degree 4, is a group of order 3 .  22. A4 does not have 
a subgroup of order 6.

For any g E G, we have 9Pg-l C gKg-' 2 K since K is normal in G. 
Hence gPg-l is also a Sylow subgroup of K .  By Sylow Theorem, there exists

Obviously, P is a Sylow subgroup of H .  Since yPy-' & yHy-'

yPy-' is also a Sylow subgroup of H .  So there exists an h E H such that

RING THEORY 
1301 
a) Prove the ring Z [ n ]  
is Euclidean. 
b) Using a), find all integer solutions to the equation y2 + 2 = x3. 
(Hurvard) 
Solution. 
a) It is readily known that Z [ n ]  is a subring of a', hence an integral 
domain. For any a = m + nz/--2 E Z[z/--2], we define 6(a) = m2 + 2n2. So we 
have a map 6 :Z[-]* + Z?, a H 6(a). 
Suppose that a, b # 0 E a[-]. 
Then ab-' = p + v.\/---z where p and Y 
are rational numbers. We can find integers u and v such that Iu - pl 5 1/2 
and lw - vI 5 1/2. Then 
a = b ( p + v G )  
= b[(u+p - u) + (v + v  - v)Q] 
= b q + r  
where Q = u + v
Q
 
is in Z[-] 
and 
r = a - bq = b(p - u) + b(v - v)Q. 
Obviously T E Z[-] 
and 
6 ( T )  = 6(b) * (lp - 2112 + 21v - wl2) 
5 6 ( b ) .  (a + 2 * t) < 6(b). 
Hence Z [ m  is Euclidean. 
(1, -1) is the set 
of units of Z[-]. 
Suppose (20, yo) be an integer solution to the equation 
y2 + 2 = x3. In the ring Z [ G ] ,  we have (yo + Q)(yo 
- G) 
= zg. Since 
the integral divisor of yo + 2/--2 or yo - 
can only be fl, 20 is not a 
prime element in Z[.\/---z]. If a = m + n- 
is an irreducible divisor of 20, 
ti = m - n&? 
is also an irreducible divisor of 20, and if alyo + n, 
then 
b) By a), Z [ G ]  is a unique factorization domain.

yo = m3 - 6mn2 
1 = 3m2n - 2n3 = (3m2 - 2n2) . n,

Let p be a prime. Show that for any element a E Z/$, there exist b, c E

When p = 2, it is trivial. 
Assume that p # 2. Let S be the set {b2 I b E a/$}. Then S =

Thus S' = {b2 I b EZ/$} = { a , T , ? 2 , . . - , ( q )  }

Now for any element a E Z/@, the set a - S := {a - b2 I b E Z/@} has 
exactly 
Since a - S C Z/pZ and Z/pZ has only p elements, 
(a - S) n S # 0. Hence there exist 6, c E a/@ such that a - b2 = c2, that is

IGL3(Z/U)I = 53(53 - 1)(52 - 1)(5 - 1) = 2 7 .  3 .  s 3 .  31.

Describe an infinite set of integral solutions (a,b) of the Pell’s equation 
z2 - 2y2 = 1 (i.e., a, b E Z  such that a2 - 2b2 = 1). 
Solution. 
Suppose that (a, 
b) is an integral solution of x 2  - 2y2 = 1. Then a must be 
odd and b even. Let a = 2a’+ 1 and b = 2b’. Then we have bf2 = v. 
So 
must be a square number. Hence either both $ and a’ f 1 are square 
numbers or a’ and 
If $ and a’ + 1 are square numbers, say a’ = 2b;, a’ + 1 = a; for some 
integers ao, bo, then b” 
= b; . ad, (ao, bo) is a solution of z2 - 2y2 = 1, and 
&om the above consideration, it is easy to see that if (ao, bo) is a solution of 
z2 - 2y2 = 1, then (al = 2 4  - 1, b = 2aobo) is another solution of z2 - 2y2 = 1. 
Obviously, ( 3 , 2 )  is an integral solution of x2 - 2y2 = 1. So if we take 
a. = 3, bo = 2 and a, = 2aP-1 - 1, bi = 2a,-lbi-l (i 2 l), we get an infinite 
set of integral solutions {(ai, bi) 1 i 2 0) of the pell’s equation x 2  - 2y2 = 1.

Remark. If a' and

(ao, bo) is an integer solution of z2 - 2y2 = -1 and a = 2 a i  + 1, b = k2aobo. 
Conversely, if (ao,bo) is an solution of 2

(b) In the general case (i.e., R not necessarily an integral domain), prove 
that R is isomorphic (as a ring) to a subring of a direct product (not necessarily

Solution. 
(a) Suppose that R is an integral domain. For any a (f 0) E R, since 
UP - a 
u(aP-1- 1 ) = 0, ap-' = 1. Hence R is a field, and for any a E R, a is 
a root of the polynomial zP - z = 0. It follows that R has at most p elements. 
Since p is a prime, Char(R) = p and R = ZlpZ. 
(b) Since for any a E R, u p  = a, the nil radical of R is 0, that is, the 
intersection of all prime ideals of R is 0. Hence

Let R be a commutative ring with 1. If R satisfies the a.c.c. (ascending 
chain condition) for finitely generated ideals then show that R satisfies the 
a.c.c. for all ideals. Give example (without proof) of such a ring which is an 
integral domain but not a p.i.d. 
(Indiana) 

49 
Solution. 
If R satisfies the a.c.c. for finitely generated ideals, then for any ideal I of 
R, 1 is finitely generated. For otherwise, we can construct a strictly ascending 
chain of finitely generated subideals of I. Hence R is a Noetherian ring, i.e., 
R satisfies the a.c.c. for all ideals. 
X[z], the polynomial ring over Z, 
satisfies the a.c.c. for all ideals, but not a 
p.i.d.

(d) If A is a maximal ideal of R, what can you say about the structure of 
S-lR and those prime ideals P of R such that P + A # R. 
S-lR? 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) Obviously, 1 = 1 + 0 E S. For any 1 + a and 1 + b, a, b E A, 
(1 + a ) ( l +  b) = 1 + (u + b+ab) 6 S. 
It follows that S is a multiplicatively closed subset of R. 
(b) It is well known that there is an one-to-one correspondence between 
the prime ideas of S-lR and those prime ideals P of R such that P n S = 0. 
Obviously, P n S # 0 if and only if P + A # R here. This is what we need to 
prove (b). 
J(R), the 
Jacobson radical of R. 
Hence 
S-lR = R. 
(d) If A is a maximal ideal of R, then S-lA is the unique maximal ideal 
of S-lR by (b). So S-lR is a local ring, and it is easy to see that S-lR is 
isomorphic to RA, the localization of R at the maximal ideal A. 
(c) If A is contained in every maximal ideal of R, then A 
So every elements in S is invertible in R.

Let I be a nilpotent ideal in a ring R, let M and N be R-modules, and let 
f : M -+ 
N be an R-homomorphism. Show that if the induced map 

50 
- 
f : M / I M  ---t N I I N  
is surjective, then f is surjective. 
Solution. 
Since 
- 
f : M / I M  -+ N / I N  
is surjective, f ( M )  + I N  = N .  It follows that 
(Harvard) 
I .  N/f(M) = I N  + f(M)/f(M) = N / f ( M ) .  
N / f ( M )  = I .  N / f ( M )  = 1 2 .  N / f ( M )  = . . * = I n  . N / f ( M )  = * .  . = 0, 
Hence 
because I is nilpotent. So N = f(M) and f is surjective.

Solution. 
Let p = p ( t )  = t - 1 E F[t]. We define V, : F ( t )  -+ I?i by %(O)

Vp(f(t)) = Ic if 0 # f ( t )  = ~ ( t ) ~

Obviously, we have

ii) V,(f(t) . dt)) = V,(f(t)) + % ( S W  and 
4 v,(f(t) + d t ) )  L fin(Vp(f(t)>, VP(dt))). 
Then, by defining If(t)l, = 2 - V p ( f ( t ) ) ,  
we get an absolute value 1

padic absolute value) on F(t). Obviously, I

R is a subring of the field F ( t )  and M is an ideal of R. 
- 
For any a(t) E R\M, we have la(t)lP = 1 and Ia(t)-'lP = 1 where a ( t ) - l  E 
F ( t )  is the inverse of a@). So, a ( t ) - l  E R and a(t) is invertible in R. Thus R

Let A be a commutative ring, and let I and J be two (proper) ideals such 
that every prime ideal of A contains either I or J but no prime ideal contains 
both I and J .  Prove that 
A N A1 x A2 
for some (nontrivial) rings A1 and A2. 
Solution. 
Since every prime ideal of A contains either I or J but no prime ideal 
contains both I and J ,  we have I J  
N ( A )  (the nil radical of A )  and I+J = A. 
There exist a E I ,  b E J such that a+ b = 1, and since ab E I J  C N ( A ) ,  there 
exists an integer n such that (ab)" = an b" = 0. Let 1 1  = (a") and 12 = (b"). 
Then I1 and I2 are proper and I1 + I2 = A, since 
( Stanford) 
1 = (a + b)2n E (a") + (b") = I1 + 12. 
By Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have 
I1 n 12 = 1 1  I2 = (a") . (b") = (a"b") = 0 
and thus A N A/I1 x A/I2 where A/I1 and A/I2 nontrivial.

Solution. 
We denote { u }  = a - [u] here. Then it is clear that 
For any real number a, [u] denotes the largest integer 5 a (Gauss function). 
f(z) = 22 - [2z] = (22)

for any z 6 [0, 1). Hence 
Since for any real number a and positive integer n, we have 
{ n .  { u } }  = n{u} - [ n .  { u } ]  = n(u - [u]) - [n(u - [u])] 
nu - [nu] = {nu}, 
f(f(f(f(f(f(.)))))) 
= { 2 6 4  = (642). 
= nu - n .  [a] - [nu - n[u]] = nu - n[u] - ([nu] - n[u]) 
= 
Notice that 2 = (642) = 642 - [64 . z] if and only if 63z = [64z]. Since 
z E [0, l), 632 = [64z] = [63z + z] (to be an integer) if and only if

Let T be the ring of all real trigonometric polynomials

Define deg f (x) = N where U N  or bN # 0. Show that deg f . g = deg f + deg g. 
Use this result to prove that T is an integral domain which is not a unique 
factorization domain. 
(Columbia) 
Solution. 
By using the orthogonality of the set (l,cosnz, sinnz I n E nV}, it is easy 
to see that 
N 
f(z) = a0 + 
a, cos nz + b, sin n2 
0 
n = l  

if and only if all the coefficients of f(z), i.e., ao, a l , .  . . , aN and bo, b l ,  -. , bN 
are zero. 
Let 
N 
f(z) = a0 + 
an cos nx + b, sin nz 
n= 1 
and 
M 
g(z) = c g  + c 
cm cosmz + d, sinmz. 
m=l 
Suppose that deg f(z) = N and deg g(z) = M .  Since 
(an cos nx + bn sin nz)

+ c andm - 
2 bncm ) sinkx] . 
m-n=k 
The coefficients of cos(N+M)x and sin(N+M)x in f(z).g(z) are a N c M ~ b N d ~  
and a N d M : b N C M  
respectively. If both of them are zero, then 
a N .  C M .  d M  = b N .  d$ = -bNCM, 
2 
and so bN(c$ + d&) = 0. Since c h  + d& # 0, bN = 0. Then we have 
aNCM = U N d M  = 0. Hence a N  = 0, which is contrary to aN or bN # 0. 
Thus we have proved that 
deg(f(z).g(x)) = N + M = d e g f ( z ) + d e g g ( z ) .  
Now f ( z ) .  g(x) = 0 can happen only if either f(z) = 0 or g(z) = 0 by the 
If f(z) . g(z) = 1, then the degree relation implies that degf(z) = 0 = 
above degree relation. So T is an integral domain. 
degg(x). Hence the units of T are {*1}. 

55 
Obviously, in T we have 
cos 22 = 
= 
(cos z + sin z)(cos z - sin z) 
(1 + a s i n  z)(1- a s i n  z). 
Again by the degree relation, all the factors cosz f sin%, 1 f f i s i n z  are 
irreducible, and cos z f 
sin z and 1 f d s i n  z are not associates. Thus cos 2% 
in T does not have an essentially unique factorization into irreducible elements. 
Hence T is not a unique factorization domain.

ai are nilpotent, then f is nilpotent. 
Solution. 
03 
(Stanford) 
Suppose that f = c

Conversely, suppose that A is Noetherian and all the elements ai are nilpo- 
tent. Let I be the ideal generated by {ai I 0 5 i < m}. Since A is commu- 
tative Noetherian, I is finitely generated and nilpotent. If I" = 0, that is, 
blbz - - .  b, = 0 for any bl, bz, * , b, E I, then it is easy to see that f" = 0.

(b) Show that the field of fractions of R, is F ( z ) ,  and determine the integral

(Stanford) 

57 
Solution. 
(a) Since F[x] i s  Noetherian and 
is finitely generated as &-module, R, is a Noetherian ring by Artin-Tate 
Lemma (or Eakin's Theorem). 
(b') Observe that 
for any a(x)/b(x) E F ( x ) .  It is clear that the field of fractions of R, is F(z). 
Obviously, z is integral over &, since z is a root of Xn+' - zn+' E Rn[X]. 
Hence F[x] is integral over R,. 
On the other hand, if a(x)/b(x) E F ( z )  is 
integral over R,, a(x)/b(z) is integral over F[z]. Since F[x] is an integrally 
closed domian, a(z)/b(z) E F[z]. Hence F[x] is the integral closure of R, in 
its field of fractions.

FIELD AND GALOIS THEORY 
1401 
1) Let X be a finite set and G a subgroup of the group of permutations 
of X. Define a relation - on X by requiring x - y if either x = y or the 
transposition (2, 
y) (which interchanges z, y E X and leaves all other elements 
fixed) is an element of G. Show the following. 
(a) - is an equivalence relation. 
(b) If G acts transitively, then all equivalence classes are distinct and con- 
tain the same number of elements. 
(c) If Card(X) is a prime number and if G acts transitively and contains 
at least one transposition then G must be the whole permutation group of X. 
2) Suppose f E &[z] is irreducible and has degree p, a prime number. If f 
has exactly p -  2 real roots and 2 complex roots, show that the Galois group of 
f over & is the symmetric group S, on p symbols. Show that the polynomial 
(x2 + 4) . x .  (z2 - 4)(x2 - 16) - 2 
is irreducible and determine its Galois group over &. 
Solution. 
( Cohmbia) 
1) (a) By the defintion of -, - is reflexive and symmetric. Since 
(x,Y)(Y,Z)(x,YY = (z,z), (. # Y , Y  # z), 
it is easy to see that - is transitive. Hence - is an equivalence relation. 
(b) Let { z l , x 2 , ~ ~ ~ , z n }  
and {y1,y2,--.,ym} be two equivalence classes of 
- determined by z = x1 and y = y1 respectively. Since G acts transitively on 
X, 
there exists g E G such that g(x) = y. For any 1 < i 5 n, we have 
(g(zl),u(zi)) = ~ ( 2 1 ,  
~ i ) g - '  E G. 
Thus { ~ ( z l ) ,  
4z2), . 
e
.
,
 ~(2,)) are n distinct elements belonging to the equi- 
valence class determined by y1 = g(x1). Hence m 2 n. Similarly, we have 
n 2 m. Thus m = n. So all equivalence classes contain the same number of 
elements. 

60 
(c) Suppose G acts transitively and contains at least one transposition. 
Then, by (b), all the equivalence classes contain the same number of elements, 
say n, and n > 1. So Card(X) = m . n, where m is the number of distinct 
equivalence classes determined by -. Since Card(X) is a prime, m = 1 and 
n = Card(X). Thus for any z,y E X, z - y, i.e., (z,y) E G. It follows 
that G is the whole permutation group of X ,  which is generated by all the 
transpositions. 
2) Suppose 
P 
f(.) 
= rI(z - Ti) 
i = l  
in @[XI. 
So E = & ( T I , .  . . , rP) is a splitting field of f(z) over & contained in a. 
Identify G = Gal(E/Q) with a permutation group of the set X = { T I ,  .. , rp} 
of the (distinct) roots by q + q1x. For any ri,rj E X, since f(z) is irreducible 
and f(ri) = 0 = f ( r j ) ,  there exists an isomorphism of&(r,)/& into&(rj)/& by 
sending ri to r j .  Since E =&(rl, 
,rp) is a splitting field of f(z) over &(ri), 
and also over Q(rj), this isomorphism can be extended to an automorphism q 
of El&. Then q E Gal(E/&) and q(ri) = ~ j ,  
which shows G acts transitively 
on X. 
Consider the conjugation automorphism onG. This maps f(z) to itself. Let 
r1 and r2 be the two non-real roots of f(z). Thus the conjugation interchanges 
r1 and r2 = Fl and fixed all other real roots. Hence the restriction of the 
conjugation to E is an element of G and it is a transposition. Thus the Galois 
group G of f(z) over & is the symmetric group Sp on { T I ,  .. 
+ , rp}. 
By Eisenstein criterion, 
f(z) = (z2 + 4)2(z2 - 4)(x2 - 16) - 2 
is irreducible over &. Let 
g(2) = (z2 + 4)2(z2 - 4)(z2 - 16). 
The real roots of g(z) are 0, f2, f4, and the graph of y = g(z) has the form 
Fig.l.1 

61 
Since Ig(n)l > 2 for any odd integer n, it is easy to see that f(z) = g(z) - 2 
has five real roots and two non-real roots. Hence the Galois group of f(z) over 
& is ST.

Let K be a field and z be an element of an extension of K such that

Solution. 
in K [ X ] .  Suppose A - yB = 0 in K(y)[X]. Then 
( CoZumbia) 
(a) Since gcd(A, B )  = 1, there exist S, T E K [ X ]  such that AS + BT = 1 
It follows that degA = 0 and deg B = deg(A) = 0, which is contrary to 
Since A(z) - yB(z) = 0, z is algebraic over K(y). If y is algebraic over K ,  
z must be algebraic over K ,  which is contrary to the assumption. Hence y is 
transendental over K .  
Again, since gcd(A, B )  = 1 in K [ X ]  (c K ( y ) [ X ] ) ,  
A - yB is irreducible in 
K[y][X] 
= K[X][y]. 
Thus A- yB is irreducible in K(y)[X]. Thus the minimal 
polynomial of z over K ( y )  is the monic polynomial which is a multiple in K ( y )  
of A - yB and 
AB 6 K .  Thus A - yB # 0. 
[ K ( z )  : K(y)] = deg(A - yB) = max{degA,deg B}. 
(b) By (a), y = A ( z ) / B ( z )  is a generator of K ( z ) / K  (i.e., K ( y )  = K ( z ) )  if 
and only if max{ deg A, deg B} = 1, or if and only if y has the form az+ b/cz +d, 
ad - bc # 0. 
(c) By (b), it is easy to see that G N GLz(K)/K* .12, where 
K* . I2 = {diag(a,a) 1 a E K*}. 

64 
If K is infinite, so is G. 
Obviously, K C Inv(G), the fixed subfield of G. On the other hand, if 
there exists some y = f(z)/g(z) E Inv(G)\K, then by (a), K ( z ) / K ( y )  is a 
finite dimensional simple extension. Hence AutK(y)K(z) is finite, which is 
contrary to the facts that G c AutK(y)K(z) and G is infinite. Thus we have 
Inv(G) = K .  
Similarly, we have Inv(H) = K ,  since H is also infinite. 
(d) Suppose K = Fq. Then 
and 
[F,(z) : Inv(G)] = q3 - q .  
For any 
g : 2 H az + b/cz + d, 
(ad - bc # 0) 
in G, it is routine to check 
g(z) = g((zq2 - Z)Q+1/(2~ 
- 2)q2+1) = 2. 
Hence F(z) c Inv(G). On the other hand, we have 
(XP2 - x)q+l/(XP - X)q2+1

(xq2 - X) 
= ( (xq-x))q+l. 
(XP - X)+P

Denote 
A = (1 + XP-’ + X(P-1)2 + . . . + X(Q-1)Q)q+l 
and 
B = (Xq - X)q2-g. 
Then gcd(A, B )  = 1 and 
max{deg A, deg B }  = q3 - q. 
Hence we have [Fq(z) : Fq(z)] = q3 - 4. Thus Inv(G) = Fq(z) and Fq(z) 
is a Galois extension of a given field L with FP C L C F,(z) if and only if 
L _> F(z). 

65 
Similarly, we have [Fq(z) 
: Inv(H)] = q since IHI = q. Let A = Xq - X 
and B = 1 in F,[X] and let z' = zq - z E Fq(z). 
Then z' E Inv(H) and by 
(a), [Fq(z) 
: Fq(z')] 
= q. Thus 
Inv(H) = F,(z') = Fq(zq - z).

(Columbia) 
Solution. 
(a) Since Y is a generator of E over C, 
there are unique homomorphisms 
u and T of E to E over C such that ,(Y) = CY and T(Y) = Y - l .  Obviously, 
(T" = 1 = r2. Hence c and T are automorphisms of E/C. Since ord(u) = n, 
ord(7) = 2 and Tu = u"-'T 
in G, G =< u , ~

order 2n. 
(b) Since 
X2" - 2.x + 1 = X2" - (Y"+Y-") + 1 
= (X" - Y")(X" - Y-") E F[X], 
Y is a root of X2" - ZX + I. 
(c) Obviously, E/Inv(G) is a Galois extension with Galois group G and 
[E : Inv(G)] = 2n. Since u(Z) = u(Yn + Y-") = Z and T(Z) = 2, we have 
Z E Inv(G) and F = C(Z) 
Inv(G). It is readily verified that X2" -ZX+ 1 is 
irreducible over F (Z is transendental over C and X2" - Z X  + 1 is irreducible 
in C[Z][X],for example, using 1403). E is a splitting field of X2" - ZX + 1 
since

F = Inv(G) and E / F  is Galois with Galois group G.

Then f ( t )  is irreducible in &(q)[t] and F is a splitting field of f ( t )  since

(c) By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, there are exactly 3 sub- 
fields lying strictly between K and F which correspond to the three proper

off(.)

(Indiana) 
Solution. 
a) If f(z) = x3 - 32 + 1 is reducible over &, then f(z) has a factor with 
degree one in &[.I, 
that is, f(x) has a root in &. Since f(2) = x3 - 3a: + 1 is 
monic, the rational roots must be integral factors of 1. But fl are not roots 
of f(z). This is a contradiction. Thus f(x) is irreducible over &. 
b) Let ,B,r be the other two roots of f(2) = z3 - 32 + 1 in a splitting field 
of f(x) over K. Obviously, cr + p + 7 = 0, crPy = -1 and the discriminant A 
of f(2) is 34. Hence /3 + y = -a and 

69 
It follows that (Y, 
= -a2 - (Y + 2 and -A 
- (Y = a2 - 2 are the roots of 
f(x). So K is a splitting field of f ( x ) .  Hence K / Q  is Galois since Char(&) = 0. 
(We may check a2 - 2 is a root of f(x) directly by using the hint).

f(.+a) = P l f ( z + a l )  + P a f ( z + a 2 ) + . . . + P n + l f ( 2 + ~ 1 n + l ) .  
This shows that { f(x + ai) 1 1 5 i 5 n + 1) spans the subspace generated by 
the G-orbit of f .  
On the other hand, suppose f(z) E K ( z ) ,  and the G-orbit off, {f(z+a) 1 
a E K }  spans a finite dimensional K-module. We write f(x) = g(z)/h(x) 
where g(z), h(z) E K[z] and (g(z), h(z)) = 1. Let f ( x + a l ) ,  f ( z + a 2 ) ,  .. . , f(x

for any a E F. Since K is infinite, an easy discussion in a splitting field of h(z)

1409 
Let E be a finite Galois extension of F and let f(z) be an irreducible 
polynomial in F[z]. Show that all the irreducible factors of f(z) over E are of 
the same degree. 
Solution. 
For any (T E G = Gal(E/F), we still denote u to be the isomorphism 
E[z] ---t E[z] which extends (T on E and maps x to z. Since f(z) E F[z], 
a(f(z)) = f(z). Let e(z) be a monic irreducible factor of f(z) over E. Then, 
for any u E G, u(e(z)) is an irreducible factor of f(z) over E. 
We prove in the following that all monic irreducible factors of f(z) over 
E arise in this way. Thus all the irreducible factors of f(z) over E are of the 
same degree. 
Suppose e’(z) is another monk irreducible factor over E. Let a and a’ 
be roots of e(z) and e‘(z) in some extension field of E. Then, CY and a’ are 
roots of f(z), which is irreducible over F .  Hence we have an isomorphism 
7 : F ( a )  -+ F(a’) which sends a to a (u E F )  and CY to a’. 
Since E / F  is Galois, we can write E = F(P), where ,B is a root of g(z), 
a separable irreducible polynomial over F .  Obviously E is a splitting field of 
g(z). Then E(a) = F(a)(P) and E(a’) = F(a’)(P) are splitting fields of g(z) 
over F ( a )  and F(a’) respectively. Hence 7 : F ( a )  -+ F(a’) can be extended 
to an isomorphism 7 of E(a) onto E(a’). Note that y(P) may not be P, but 
q(P) is a root of q(q(z)) = g(z). It follows that 
Now, since a and a’ are roots of the monic irreducible polynomial e(z) and 
e’(z) over E respectively, 7 : E(a) + E(a’) is an isomorphism and ~ ( a )  
= a’, 
we must have (vlE)(e(z)) = e’(z) and dege(z) = dege’(z).

f ( t )  = (t - u - il)(t - u - i2) * * * (t - u - in). 
Comparing the coefficients of the term of degree n - 1, we obtain n .  u + il +

v and w such that w . n + wp = 1, u = (v . n + wp) u = v(n . u) E K . Thus we 
have

field of t62 - 1. Thus we have E N F and [F :as] = 3.

(a) Suppose you are given a field L, & C_ L

and every finite field extension K / L ,  K 5 a' is of even degree. Show that every 
finite field extension of L must in fact have degree equal to a power of 2. 
(b) Show that such a field L actually exists. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) Let K / L  ( K  Ca') be a finite field extension. We have to show [K : L] 
is a power of 2. For this purpose, we may assume that K is Galois over L. 
Let G = GalK/L and JGJ = 2n . m where m is odd. By Sylow's Theorem, 
G has a subgroup H of order 2n. If K' is the corresponding subfield of KIL, 
then [K : K'] = 2" and [K' : L] = m. Since L has no proper odd dimensional 
extension field, we must have m = 1, and so K' = 1; and [K : L] = 2n. 
(b) Let L be the field of real algebraic numbers, that is, the subfield of 1R 
of numbers which are algebraic over &. Then & 2 L & (X and L/& is algebraic. 
Now for any finite field extension KIL, K 
a', there exists some element 
a: E K such that K = L ( o )  by Primitive Element Theorem. Let f(a:) be 
the minimal polynomial of o over L. Then f(a:) has no real root since f(a:) 
is irreducible in L[z]. So, f(z), when decomposed in nZ[a:], is a product of 
irreducible polynomials of degree 2. Hence, 
[K : L] = [L(a) : L] = degf(s) 
is even. By (a), it is in fact a power of 2.

(Indiana) 
Solution. 
such that 
(a) If [L : KP] is finite, there exists a finite set of elements {bl, b2,...,bn} 
KP(b1,b2,.*.,bn) = L. 
Without loss of generality, we can assume that bi $! 
KP(bl-..bi-1) for any 
1 5 i 5 n (KP(b1,. + .  , bi-1) = KP when i = 1). Since 
and 
bi @ KP(bl,...,bi-l), 
[KP(bl,. . . , bz) : KP(b1, * .  . , bz-l)] = p. 
tP - bp is irreducible in KP(b1,. . . , bi-l)[t]. Hence 
It follows that 
[L : KP] 1 [KP(bl, b2, * * .  , b,) : L] 
n 
= n [ K P ( b l , - - - , b i )  
: KP(bl,...,b;-l)] 
i=l 
= p”. 
(b) If KP # K ,  there exist pindependent subsets. For example, if 6 E 
K\Kp, B = {b} is a pindependent subset of K .  Now suppose that {Bi I i E I} 
is a chain of pindependent subsets of K .  Let B = U Bi. Then for any 
finite set {bl,. . . , b,} 
of distinct elements of B ,  there exists some i, such that 
{ b l , b 2 , - - - , b m }  C Bi. Since Bi is apindependent subset, 
i € I  
[KP(bl,b2,..-,bm): KP) =pm. 
It follows that B is pindependent. By Zorn’s Lemma, K contains a maximal 
pindependent subset. 

75 
(c) Let B be a maximal pindependent subset of K .  Suppose Kp(B) c K .  
Let b E K\Kp(B). Then B U {b} is pindependent. The reason is that, for any 
distinct elements b l , b 2 , . - * ,  b, in B U {b}, if b @ {bl,b2,...,bm}, then 
and 
[KP(bl, 
* * 1 ,  bm) : KP] = pm, 
and if b E {bl,bz,...,b,}, 
say, b = b,, 
then {bl,-..,b,-l} 
C B and we still 
have 
[KP(bl,. . . , b,) 
: KP] 
[KP(bl, 
* .  . , b,) 
: KP(b1,. . . , bm-l)] . [KP(bl,. . . , b,-l) 
: KP] 
= 
- 
- p.*"-l = p"* 
Since B C B U { b } ,  the independency of B U {b} contradicts the maximality of 
B. Thus we have KP(B) = K .

Find a Galois extension E over & with Gal(E/&) cyclic of order 16.

For any positive integer n, the cyclotomic field &(zn) over & is a Galois 
extension and [&(zn) : &] = d(n) where z, is an n-th primitive root of the

Let A and B be connected subspaces of a topological space X, such that 
A n B # 8. Prove that A U B is connected. If A and B are path connected, 
need A U B be path connected? 
Solution. 
Let f be any continuous map from A U B to So = {-1,l). Since A is 
connected, f
(
~
 
must be constant. Without loss of generality, we may assume 
that A c f-'(-l). By the same reason, f
l
~
 
is also constant. Let zo E AnB. 
We have f(zo) = -1. Since f is continuous, there exists a neighborhood of zo, 
say U ,  such that U c f-'(-l). But since zo E B, 
there is a point of B which 
belongs to U .  Therefore we have B c f-'(-l). Hence f is not surjective. It 
means that A U B is connected. 
The following example shows that if A and B are path connected then 
A u B needs not to be path connected. Let 
(Indiana) 
A = ((0,O)) C R2

and 
B = {(z,sin -) I0 < z 5 1). 
Then A and B are path connected and A n B = A, but A U B is not path 
connected.

Suppose that A and B are compact subspaces of spaces X and Y respec- 
tively, and that N is an open neighborhood of

Solution. 
Let' z be a point of A. For any y E B, 
since (z, y) belongs to A x B and N 
is an open neighborhood of A x B c X x Y ,  there exist open sets U,(z) c X 
and V,(z) c Y such that 
( Z C , Y )  E V,(z) 
x V,(4 c N .  
Therefore the family of open sets {Vy(z), y E B }  covers B. Since B is compact, 
there is asubcover {VYi(z),i

On the other hand, {U(z),z E A }  is an open cover of A. Since A is also

compact, there exists asubcover { U ( z i ) , j  = l , . . - , q }  such that A c u U ( z j ) .  
Let U = U U ( z j )  and V = n V(zj). It is easy to see that U and V are open

Solution. 
If X is compact, then X is normal and the existence off is obvious. Hence 
we may assume that X is noncompact. We denote by X" the one-point com- 
pactification of X. Since X is locally compact and Hausdorff, X' is compact 
and Hausdorff, and consequently is also a normal space. Let X* = X U {m}. 
It is easy to see that A and F = B u{m} are two disjoint closed subsets of X'.

and onto, then f is a closed map. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) Let X be a topological space and - be an equivalence relation on X. 
Define by X /  - the space of equivalence classes under -. By the quotient 
map ?r : X -+ X/ - we mean the map which assigns to x E X the equivalence 

86 
class containing x. The quotient space X /  - may be topologized by defining 
a subset U c X/ - to be open if and only if r-'(U) is open in X .  Under 
this topology, r becomes a continuous map. More generally, if f : X + Y is 
a continuous map, there is naturally associated an equivalence relation on X 
such that z1 - 5 2  if and only if f(x1) = f(z2). If Y is homeomorphic to X /  - 
under the map i : X/ 
--+ 
Y and f = i o T then we call f a quotient map. 
(b) Let A be a closed subset of X .  Since X is compact, A is compact too. 
It follows from the continuity of f that f ( A )  is a compact subset of Y .  Since 
Y is Hausdorff, f ( A )  is closed in Y .  Hence f is a closed map. 
(c) Let - be the equivalence relation on X associated to the map f. Denote 
by [z] the equivalence class containing 2. Then we define a map i : X/ -4 Y 
by i([x]) = f(x). Since f is onto, i is obviously a 1 - 1 map. By the result of 
(b), the quotient space X /  - is compact. Hence i is a continuous 1 - 1 map 
from the compact space X /  N to the Hausdorff space Y , and, therefore, is a 
homeomorphism. It is clear that f = i o T .  So f is a quotient map. 
2106

space Y .  Let C be a closed subspace of Y ,  and let U be an open neighborhood

(a) Prove that if X is compact then there is an open neighborhood V of C 
in Y such that f-'(V) c U .  
(b) Give a counterexample to show that if X is not compact, then there 
need not be such a neighborhood V .  
Solution. 
(a) Let W = X - U ,  then W is closed in X .  Since X is compact, W 
is compact too. Since f is a continuous function, f(W) is a compact set of 
Y ,  and consequently is a closed set of Y because Y is a Hausdorff space. 
Let V = Y - f(W). Then V is an open neighborhood of C in Y .  Since 
W c f-'(f(W)), we see that 
(Indiana) 
f-'(v) = x - f-l(f(w)) c x - w = u. 
(b) Let X = R and Y = S1. 
f : X -+ Y is the continuous function defined

normal. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) Let R : X 
----f Y be the identification map and yo E Y be the point 
which A collapses to. Let U and V be two nonernpty closed sets in Y such 
that U n V = 0. Then R-'(U) and R-'(V) are two nonempty disjoint closed 
sets in X .  If yo $ U U V, then, by the normality of X, it is clear that there 
exist two disjoint open sets W1 and Wz in X containing R-'(U) and R-'(V) 
respectively such that WinA = 8 for i equal to 1 and 2. Thus we see that R ( W ~ )  
and R ( W ~ )  
are two disjoint open sets in Y and contain U and V respectively. 
If yo E U (or V), we only need to take the sets W1 and Wz without the 
restrictions that Wi n A = 0. 
(b) Let X be a regular space which is not a normal space. It means that 
there exist two disjoint closed sets A and B in X such that they cannot be 
separated by disjoint open sets in X .  Then the quotient space Y obtained by 
collapsing A to a point yo is not regular, because one can prove that the point 
yo and the closed set R(B) in Y cannot be separated by disjoint open sets in 
Y .

Let p : E --f B be a covering map with E locally path connected and simply

88 
and f l ,  f2 : X -+ 
E be two lifts of f .  Prove that there is a deck transformation 
g : E + E such that fi = g f 1 .  
Solution. 
Take a point zo E X and let f l ( z 0 )  = eo E E. Then eo E p-l(bo), where 
bo = p(e0). Let f2(20) = el. Since p f 1  = pf2 = f ,  we see that el E p-l(b0). 
By the assumptions p : E -+ B is the universal covering map. Thus there exists 
a deck transformation g such that g(e0) = el. Therefore, gfl(z0) = f z ( 2 0 ) .  
Let 
(Indiana) 
A = {. 
E x I s f 1 ( z )  = f 2 ( z ) } .  
It is obvious that A is not empty. 
It is not difficult to prove that A is both-open-and-closed in X. Thus, by 
the connectedness of X ,  we see that A = X, which means fi = g f l  : X -+ E.

Suppose that U = {UA,X E A} is an open covering of X .  For any point 
z E X, let p-'(z) = (21,. 
.. , Z n } .  Let W ( z )  be an elementary neighborhood, 
i.e., W(x) is an path-connected open neighborhood of x such that each path 
component of p-'(W(z)) is mapped topologically onto W ( z )  by p. Let

a U, E U such that Z, E Ui. Let c ( z )  be the path component of %,(z) n Ui 
containing Zi. It is obvious that each &(x) is open and R(z) n 
(x) = 0 for 
i # j .  Since p is an open map, fi p ( c ( z ) )  is an open neighborhood of z in X .  
Choose another elementary neighborhood V(z) of z such that

Let

that T(z) c E(z) c Ui for i = l , - - + , n .  
It follows that p-'(V(z)) c 6 
Ui. 
That is, we have proved that for any point z E X there exists an elementary 
neighborhood V(z) of 3: such that p-l(V(z)) can be covered by afinite number 
of sets in U. Since X is compact, X can be covered by a finite number of V(zi), 
i = 1,. . - , m, and consequently X can be covered by a finite subcover of U.

Let 7 and U be two different topology on X such that X is compact and 
Hausdorff with respect to both. Prove that 7 p U. (Recall that 7 c U means 
that every set in the topology 7 is contained in U.) 
Solution. 
We use the reduction to absurdity. Suppose that 7 c U. Let ( X , 7 )  and 
( X , U )  denote the topological spaces of X with respect to 7 and U respectively. 
h : (X,U) 
-+ (X,'T) is the identity map of X. Then h is a 1 - 1 map from 
the compact space ( X , U )  to the Hausdorff space (X, 
7). We claim that h is a 
continuous map. For any point 20 E X .  Let U be any open neighborhood of 
3:o in ( X , 7 ) .  Since 7 c U, 
U is also an open neighborhood of zo in (X,U). 
It is obvious that h(z0) = zo and h(U) = U .  Hence h is continuous at 20. 
Thus h is a homeomorphism from (X, 
U) 
to (X, I), 
which means U = 1. 
This 
contradicts the assumption.

Let X be a topological space and let A c X. Show that if C is a connected 
subset of X that intersects both A and X - A ,  then C intersects BdA. (Recall

Solution. 
We use the reductio ad absurdum. Suppose that C n BdA = 0. Take 
U = Cnx and V = C n ( X  - A ) .  Since C n A  c U and C n ( X  - A )  c V ,  
(Indiana) 

from the assumption, we see that both U and V are nonempty subset of C. 
It is clear that C = U U V and both U and V are closed subsets of C ,  and, 
consequently, that both U and V are open sets of C. But 
u n v = c n A n ( X  - A )  = C n  B ~ A

which is a contradiction to the connectedness of C.

(b) If A is compact, show that C, ( A )  is closed in X .  Must C, ( A )  be closed 
for a general subspace A of X ?  
Solution. 
(a) Let 20 be any point of O,(A). By the definition of O,(A), there exists 
a point a E A such that d(z0, u) < E ,  i.e., 6 = E - d(z0, a) > 0. Then, for any

4 
d ( z , a ) ~ d ( z , z o ) + d ( z o , a ) <

which means that 06/4(zo) c O,(A). Thus O,(A) is an open subspace of X .  
(b) Let zo be any cluster point of Ce(A). Then there exists a sequence

counterexamples to the following assertions: 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
Y = {a, b, c}. The topology on Y is determined by the family of open sets 
a) This assertion is not correct. We give a counterexample as follows. Let 
7 = { { a ,  b, el, {a, C l ,  {b, c ) ,  {c}, 0). 
Since any neighborhood of the point a always contains the point c, Y is not a 
Hausdorff space. But it is easy to see that the subspace {c} is dense in Y and 
is Hausdorff. 
b) This assertion is true. We give a proof to it as follows. If Y were not 
connected, then there would exist a nonempty proper subset U of Y which 
is both-open-and-closed in Y. Let A = X n U .  Since X is dense in Y and 
U is open in Y, 
A would be a nonempty open set of X. On the other hand, 
X - A = X n (Y - U )  would be an open set of X ,  because Y - U is open in 
Y .  Thus A would be a nonempty subset of X, which is both-open-and-closed 
in X. Since X is dense in Y and Y - U is open in Y ,  X - A is nonempty. It 
means A # X .  This contracts the connectedness of X .

tinuous. 
Solution. 
a) Let N be an open set of Y. 
Since flu and fv are continuous, f-'Iu(N) 
and f-'lv(N) are open in, respectively, U and V .  But U and V are open in 
X ,  therefore, f-'Iu(N) and f - l I v ( N )  are also open in X. Thus

fF1(N) = f-lIv(N) uf-'Iv(N)

is open in X ,  and consequently, f is continuous. 
b) Let X = [0,2], U = [0, 1) and V = [l, 21. f : X + R is defined by 
x X E U ,  
f(x) = { 2 
XEV. 
Then f (u and flv are continuous, but f is not continuous.

Let q : X --t Y be a quotient space projection from a topological space X 
to a connected topological space Y. Assume that q-l(y) is connected for each 
y E Y .  
a) Show that X is connected. 
b) Is X necessarily connected if the map q is not assumed to be a quotient 
mapping? Justify your assertion. 
( Co turn bia) 
Solution. 
a) Suppose that X is not connected. Thus, there exist two disjoint non- 
empty open subsets of X ,  U and V such that X = UUV. Then q(U)nq(V) = 0. 
For otherwise, let y E q(U) n q(V). Therefore, 
q-YY) = (q-l(y) n U )  u (q-l(y) n V ) ,  
and it is obvious that q-l(y) n U and q-l(y) n V are both nonempty open 
subsets of q-l(y), which contradicts the connectedness of q-'(y). 
Since q is 
a quotient mapping, V = q-l(q(V)) and U = q-l(q(U)), 
q(U) and q(V) are 
disjoint nonempty open subsets such that Y = q(U) U q(V), which contradicts 
the connectedness of Y .  Thus X must be connected. 
b) The following example shows that the assumption that q is a quotient 
mapping is necessary for X to be connected. Let X = U U V ,  where 
U = { ( x , O )  E R2 10 5 2 5 1) 
and 
v = ((1,y) E R2 11 5 y 5 2). 
The topology of X is induced from the topology of R2. Let Y = [0,1], the unit 
interval of R, and : X --+ Y be the map defined by q ( x ,  0) = x for ( x , O )  E U 
and q(1,y) = 1 for (1,y) E V .  Then q is continuous but is not a quotient 
mapping. For each y E Y, 
q-l(y) is connected. But X is not connected.

Let X and Y be topological spaces, with Y compact. Let p : X x Y -+ X

Solution. 
Let U c X x Y be a closed subset and zo E X -p( U). Then, for any y E Y ,  
( 2 0 ,  y) 6 U .  Since U is closed, there exist an open set Wz,(y) of X and open set 
V,(ZO) of Y such that (ZO,Y) E Wz0(y) x V,(ZO) and (Wzo(y) x V,(zo))nU = 0. 
Since Y is compact, there must exist a finite number of V,, (zo), ' . , VYn (zo) 
such that

w ( ~ ~ )

i = l  
n 
Let 
i=l 
Then W(z0) is an open neighborhood of zo in X .  Since (W(z0) x Y )  n U = 0, 
we see that W(z0) np(U) = 0, i.e., W(z0) C X - p ( U ) .  Thus X - p ( U )  is an 
open set of X ,  and consequently, p(V) is closed in X ,  which means that p is a 
closed map.

Let Y be a connected subset of the topological space, and let 2 be a set 
such that Y is a subset of 2 and 2 is a subset of the closure of Y .  Prove that 
2 is connected. 
(Minnesotu) 
Solution. 
According to the assumptions, we have Y c 2 c F. Let f : 2 -+ So be any 
continuous map, where So = {-1,1} is the O-dimensional sphere with discrete 
topology. Since Y is connected, without loss of generality, we may assume that 
f ( Y )  = {l}, i.e., Y c f-'(l). Taking closures of these two sets with respect to 
2 and noting that f-'(l) is a closed subset of 2, we get (Y)z 
c f-'(l). But 
as well-known, (Y)z = Y n 2 = 2. Thus we have 2 c f-'(l), and it follows 
that f is not surjective. It means that there does not exist any continuous 
surjective map from 2 to So and therefore 2 is connected.

Let A be a connected subspace of a connected set X .  If C is a component 
of X\A, show that X\C is connected. 
( Cincinnati) 
Solution. 
We first prove that if X is a connected space, U is a connected subset of X ,  
and if V is a both-open-and-closed subset with respect to X\U, then U U V is 
connected. Suppose that U U V is not connected. Then let U U V = W1 U W2 
where W1 and W2 are two disjoint nonempty both-open-and-closed subsets of 
U U V. Since U is connected, without loss of generality, we may assume that 
U c W,. Thus W1 is a both-open-and-closed subset of V ,  and, consequently, 
a both-open-and-closed subset of X\U. 
Hence W1 is a nonempty both-open- 
and-closed subset of (U U V )  U (X\U) = X , which contradicts the assumption 
that X is connected. So the above statement is proved. 
Now suppose that X\C 
is not connected. Let X\C = U U V where U 
and V are two disjoint nonempty both-open-and-closed subsets of X\C. Since 
A c X\C 
and A is connected, we may assume that A C V. By the above 
fact, C u U is connected because C is connected. Since C U U c X\A and 
CnU = 0, we see that CUU is a connected subset of X\A containing C, which 
contradicts that C is a component of X\A. Hence X\C 
must be connected.

Solution. 
a) Suppose that X has a dense subset A which has property S. Then, 
for any E > 0, there is a cover {Val& E I?} of A by connected sets such that 
each V, has diameter < ~ / 2 .  Since each V, is connected, va is also connected 
( Cincinnati)

and obviously has diameter < E .  Since

{Val Q: E I'} is a cover of X by connected sets each of which has diameter < E. 
Thus X has property S. 
b) We give a counterexample as follows. Let R denote the euclidean real 
line, X be the set of all rational numbers. Then x = R has property S, but it 
is easy to see that X does not have property S.

Solution. 
Let

U = {f-’((a, b)) 1 (a, b) is any open interval of R and f E F } .  
Then there exists a unique topology 7 
on the set S of which U is the topology 
subbase. It is easy to see that 7 is the weakest topology on S amongst all 
those for which all members of F are continuous. Suppose that s1 and s2 are 

98 
two distinct points of S. By the assumption there exists at least an f E F 
such that f(s1) # ~ ( s z ) .  Hence we may take two open intervals (a1,bl) and 
( a z , b z )  such that f ( S i )  E (ai,bi) for i = 1 , 2  and (a1,bl) n ( U Z ,  bz) = 0. Then

Solution. 
a> 
As is well-known, we can present the torus T as the space obtained by 
identifying the opposite sides of a square, as shown in Fig.2.3 (b). Under the 
identification the sides a and b each become circles which intersect in the point 
20. Let y be the center point of the square, and let U = T - {y}. Let V 
be the image of the interior of the square under the identification. Since V is 
simply connected, by the Van Kampen theorem, we conclude that ?rl(T, 
TI) 
is isomorphic to 7~1(U, z1) modulo the smallest normal subgroup of ?rl(U, 21) 
containing the image +*(rl(UnV, TI)), where qL is the homomorphism induced 

100 
by the inclusion map q5 : U n V  -+ 
U .  It is easily seen that aub is a deformation 
retract of U .  Hence a l ( U ,  20) is a free group on two generators a and p, where 
a and p are presented by circles a and b, respectively. It is also clear that 
T ~ ( U , Z ~ )  
is a free group on two generators a’ = F1a6 and p’ = C1p6, 
where 6 is the equivalence class of a path d from 20 to 21. (See Fig.2.3 (b).) 
On the other hand, it is easy to see that xl(U n V,zl) is an infinite cyclic 
group generated by 7, 
the equivalence class of a closed path c which circles 
around the point y once, and, consequently, that q5+(y) = c y ’ p I ~ y ’ - ~ f l ‘ - ~ .  The 
smallest normal subgroup of al(U, 21) containing &(al(U n V, 21)) is just the 
commutator subgroup of 7rl(U, 21). Thus ?rl(T, 
21) is a free abelian group on 
two generators a’ and p’. Changing to the base point 20, we see that rl(T, 20) 
is a free abelian group on two generators a and fl, which are presented by 
circles a and b, respectively. 
In a similar way, we can see that the fundamental group of the oriented sur- 
face of genus 2 is a free group on four generators a1,p1, a2,p2 with the single re- 
lation [a1,/31][a2,p2], 
where a l , p 1 ,  a2,/32 are presented by circles al, bl,aa,ba, 
respectively, and [ail pi] denotes the commutor aipiailpzrl. (See Fig.2.3 (a).) 
b)

Let X denote the figure 8 space, as shown in Fig.2.4. Let U = X -  { q } ,  V = 
X - { p } .  By the Van Kampen theorem we can prove that al(X,zo) is a free 
group on two generators a,p, where a,P are presented by circles a and b, 
respectively. 
The following picture is a piece of its universal covering space.

map y' : S1 + X - fn(A) 
(y'(s) = y(s) for s E S') is also nullhomotopic. 
Solution. 
i) Since X is compact and A is closed, A is also compact. Thus it is easy 
to see that f"(A) is compact, closed and connected. Noting that ,,+'(A) c 
f"(A) c A for any n, and that A is compact, we see that B = n fn(A) 
is a nonempty closed subset of A. Suppose that B is not connected. Then 
B = U u V ,  where U and V are disjoint nonempty closed subsets of B. It is 
obvious that U and V are also closed subsets of A. Since A is obviously compact 
and Hausdorff, A is a normal space. Therefore, there exist disjoint open subsets 
of A, Wl and Wz such that U c W1 and V c W2. Thus it follows that 
B c W1 U Wz = W ,  which is an open subset of A. We claim that there exists 
a positive integer N such that fN(A) c W .  For, otherwise, there would be a 
squence in A, {xn}, such that x, E f"(A) but 2, @ W for every n. It means 
that x, E A - W for every n. Since A - W is closed in A and, consequently, is 
a compact subset, there exists at least a limit point 20 of the sequence { x C n } .  
Noting that fn(A) is compact for every n and fn+'(A) c fn(A), 
we can see 
that xo E B c W ,  which is a contradiction. Thus f N ( A )  c W ,  and therefore,

map. Since F(S1 x I) is compact and X - B is open, F(S' x I) is also closed in 

102 
X .  Since X is normal, there exists open sets U and V such that F(S1 x I )  c U 
and B c V .  From the proof for i), it follows that there exists a positive N 
such that fN(A) c V .  Therefore, 
F(S1 x I )  c u c x - fN(A). 
Particularly, y(S') c X - fN(A). The remainder of ii) is obvious.

Define H : RP" x I -+ R" by 
H ( z , t )  (1 - t).T(z) + tpo.

Then H is a homotopy between f and the constant map PO. So fl is null-

X may be identified with the space shown in Fig.2.6, which is obtained by 
identifying the sides of a 2-gon. Let y be the center of the 2-gon, U = X - {y}, 
and V be the interior of the 2-gon. Then, U and V are open subsets, U ,  
V, and U n V are path connected, and V is simply connected. Thus, by 
the Van Kampen theorem, 7rl(X,zl) is isomorphic to the quotient group of 
al(U, 2 1 )  modulo the smallest normal subgroup of R ~ ( U ,  
21) containing the 
image q5,(al(U n V, zl)), 
where q5* is the homomorphism induced by the inclu- 
sion map q5 : U n V -+ U .  It is easy to see that u is a deformation ratract of U .  
Therefore, al(U, zl) 
is an infinite cyclic group on the generator S-luS, where 
S is the equivalence class of a path d connecting 20 and z1. (See Fig.2.6) It 
is also clear that xl(U n V, 
zl) is an infinite cyclic group on the generator y, 
where y is the equivalence class of a closed path c which goes once round the 
point y. It is easy to see that &(y) = lrl(u,zl). Therefore we conclude that 
To compute H , ( X ) ,  we may apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to the pair 
(U, V). The conclusion is that H i ( X )  is an infinite cyclic group for i equal to

104 
Solution. 
(i) Let a : R -+ S1 be the universal covering map defined by ~ ( t )  
= eZrrit, 
and f : S” --+ S1 
be a continuous map. Since al(S”) = 0 for n 2 2, we see that 
there is a lifting of f, 7 
: S” --+ R such that T? = f. Since R is contractible, 
?must be homotopic to a constant map 
: S” -+ R, hence f is homotopic to 
a o c = C, 
which is also a constant map from S” to S1, 
i.e., there does not 
exist any continuous map f : Sn -+ S1 which is not homotopic to a constant 
map. 
(ii) Since al(RPn) = Zz, any continuous map f : RPn -+ S1 induces 
a trivial homomorphism f* : x1(Rrn) -+ al(S1), and, consequently, has a 
lifting 7: 
RP” -+ R such that a o f = f. By the same argument as in (i), f 
must be homotopic to a constant. 
(iii) Denote T = S1 x S1 by T = (e2rritl,e2nit2 
), 0 5 t l ,  t z  5 1. Define 
f :T+S1 by 
f ( p i t l ,  e 2 x i t z  ) =  e27ritl E sl. 
It is easy to see that the induced homomorphism f* : H1(T) -+ H1(S1) maps 
one generator of H1(T) to the generator of H1(S1), and another generator 
to zero. Hence f* is not trivial, which means that f is not homotopic to a 
constant.

A continuous map of topological spaces: p : E -+ B is called a fibration if it 
has the homotopy lifting property - that is, for any pair of continuous maps

a continuous map H : X x I --+ E such that H l x x i o )  = h and pH = G. Let 
p : E -+ B be a fibration, bo E B be a base point, F = p-l(bo) (the “fiber”),

Solution.

where f : I -+ B is a closed path at bo 
which represents a. Let G : I x I --f B be a continuous map defined by

G(t,s) = f ( s t )  for ( s , t )  E I x I ,  and h : I x (0) --+ E be the constant map 
such that h(t,O) 
eo. It is obvious that p h  = GII,{o}. Therefore there 
exists a continuous map H : I x I + E such that H / I x { o }  = h and p H  = G. 
Particularly we have p H ( t ,  1) = f ( t ) .  Let C : I -+ E be a path in E defined 
by c(t) = H ( t ,  1). Then pc = f. Let c(0) = el and c(1) = e2. It is clear that 
el and e2 belong to F. Since F is path-connected, we may choose two paths 
g1 and 92 in F such that gl(0) = e2, gl(1) = el, g2(0) = el and gz(1) = el. 
Thus f = g2 * c * g1* gF1 is a closed path at el, where gF1 is the inverse path 
of g2. Noting that pgl, pg2 and pgz' are all constant path at bo, we have 
- 
P# rfi = bfi = bg21 . b.1 . bg11 . h , l I  = bl = [fl = a, 
which means that p# is surjective. 
(ii) Let a = [f] E .Irl(F,eo). It is obvious that p# . i#(a) = [pf] = [bo], 
where bo is the constant

path at bo. Hence im, c kerp#. On the other hand, 
suppose that G = [f] E kerp#. Then there exists a homotopy G : I x I --+ B 
between pTand the constant path bo such that G(t, 0) = (pT)(t), G(t, 0) = bo, 
and G(0, s )  
G(l, s )  E bo for any s. By the homotopy lifting property, there

exists a continuous map H : I x I --+ E such that P H  = G and H ( t ,  0) = f(t). 
Let c1 = HI{oixr, cg = H11,{1} and c3 = H l { l } x ~ .  Then c1, cg and c3 are 
paths in F and cl(0) = eo, ~ ( 1 )  
= cz(O), ~ ( 1 )  
= ci1(0) and c i 1 ( l )  = eo. 
Hence c = c1 x c2 x c i l  is a closed path in F with base point eo. It is easy to 
see that f is homotopic to C. (See Fig.2.7.) Therefore, G = [fi = [c] = i#[c].

Is the canonical map q : S2 --+ RP2 (which identifies antipodal points of 
S2) nullhomotopic? Why or why not? 
(Indiana) 

106 
Solution. 
It is well-known that q is also the universal covering map from S2 to RP2. 
Suppose that q is nullhomotopic. Then q is homotopic to a constant map 
c : S2 --+ RP2, and therefore q has a lifting < : S2 -+ S2 which is also homotopic 
to the lifting of c, a constant map C : S2 + S2. But it is obvious that f is 
the identity map or the antipodal map from S2 to S2. Hence degg = fl. On 
the other hand, we have degc = degZ = 0. This is a contradiction. Thus we 
conclude that q is not nullhomotopic.

Let p : E ---f B be an universal cover with E and B path-connected and 
locally path-connected. Let T : B + B be a map so that Tn = Id and so that 
T(b) = bfor some b E B. (Here Tn = T o T o - - . o T ,  n times.) Show that there 
is a map ? : E --+ E so that p o T  = T o p  and Tn = Id. 
Solution. 
We have 
T o p(eo) = T ( b )  = b. Since ?rl(E) is trivial, there is a lifting of T o p ,  T : 
( E ,  eo) + ( E ,  eo) such that p o ? = T o p. Since

and 
T"(e0) = T"-'(T(eo)) = T*-'(eo) = ... = T ( e 0 )  = eo, 
we see that @ is a lifting of T" o p  at the base point eo. On the other hand, 
since T" = Id, it follows that identity map Id : (E, 
eo) + ( E ,  eo) is obviously 
a lifting of T n p  at the base point eo. Therefore, by the uniqueness of lifting, 
we conclude that r?;. = Id.

Let T2 = S1 x S1, 
and let X c T2 be the subset S1 x { 1) U (1) x S1. 
Prove 
that there is no retraction of T2 to X .  
Solution. 
We use the reduction to absurdity. Suppose that there is a retraction of T2 
to X ,  denoted by r. Let i : X --t T2 be the inclusion map. Then roi : X --+ X is 
(Indiana) 

107 
the identity map. Hence ~,oi, : r l ( X )  -+ r l ( X )  is the identity homomorphism. 
It is well-known that r1(T2) is abelian and that .1(X) is an non-abelian free 
group on two generators denoted by a and b. Hence we have ab # ba and 
i*(a)i*(b) = z*(b)i*(a). Therefore we have 
which is a contradiction.

Let A c R3 be the union of the x and y-axis,

and let p = ( O , O ,  1). 
a) Compute H1(R3 - A). 
b) Prove that rl(R3 - A , p )  is not abelian. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
Let X = {(x, y, z) I x2 + z2 = 1) be a circular cylindrical surface. pl and 
p2 denote the points (1,0,0) and ( - l , O ,  0) respectively. Then it is easy to see 
that X - {pl,p2) is a deformations retract of R3 - A. It is also clear that 
X - {pl,pz) is homotopically equivalent to the space Y as shown in Fig.2.8. 
Fig.2.8 
a) Y has a structure of a graph with 4 vertices and 6 edges. The Euler 
Characteristic K ( Y )  = 4 - 6 = -2. 
Hence the rank of H I ( Y )  is equal to 
1 - (-2) = 3. Therefore we conclude that H1(R3 - A) M H1(Y) z Y Z  @YZ @Z. 
b) Let e be a point on the arc ab different from a and b. Take U = Y - { c }  
and V = Y - { e } .  Then we have Y = U U V ,  It is easy to see that U has the 

108 
same homotopy type as S1 and that V has the same homotopy type as the 
“eight figure space”. Since U n V is contractible, by the Van Kampen theorem 
we see that ?rl(Y) is a free group generated by ?rl(V) and ?rl(V). Therefore we 
conclude that ?rl(R3 - A,p) M ?rl(Y) is a free group on three generators and, 
consequently, that 
( R3 - A, p )  is not abelian.

that there is a lifting of f, TO : ( X ,  ZO) --+ (Y, 9. Show that there is a second

Let X be the identification space obtained from a unit 2-disk by identifying

Solution. 
Fig.2.9 
Take a point y in the open disk. (See Fig.2.9.) Let U = X - {y} and let 
V be the open disk. Then both U and V are path connected subsets of X 
and X = U U V .  Since V is simply connected, by the Van Kampen theorem, 
r1(X) is isomorphic to the quotient group of r l ( U )  with respect to the least 
normal subgroup containing 4*(rl(U n V ) ) ,  where 4 : (U n V )  + rl(U) is 
the homomorphism induced by the inclusion 4 : U n V -+ U .  Take a point 
z1 E U n V as the base point. (See Fig.2.9.) It is clear that r l ( U  n V, zl) is 
an infinite cyclic group generated by yo the closed path class of a closed path 
c which circles around the point y once. Since the circle a is a deformation 
retract of U ,  it is clear that wl(U, zo) is an infinite cyclic group generated by 
u' the closed path class of a. Therefore r l ( U 1  21) is an infinite cyclic group on 
generator Z = y-'a'y, where y is the path class of a path d from z o  to z1. 
It is also clear that 4+(yc) 
= 3Z. Hence the least normal subgroup containing 
4*(rl(U n V ) )  is isomorphic to 32. It follows that rl(X) NNZG/U =as.

Sketch a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (every nonconstant 
polynomial with complex coefficients has a complex zero) using techniques of 
algebraic topology. 
Solution. 
Let 
denote the complex plane and f (2) be a polynomial of positive degree 
with complex coeficients. We may consider f to be a continuous nonconstant 
map f : a' -+a. Note that I f(z)l + 00 as JzI + 00; hence, we may extend f 
(Indiana) 

110 
to a map of the one-point compactification of (X 
f : s2 -+ s2 
by setting f(m) = 00, where 00 denotes the north pole. Then we may first 
prove that if f(z) = zk, k > 0, then the degree of the extension f : S2 -+ S2 is 
equal to k. Furthermore, we may prove that if f is any polynomial of degree 
k > 0 then the degree of the extension f : S2 -+ S2 is still equal to k. Noting 
the fact that if a continuous map f : S2 + S2 is not surjective then the degree 
off is zero, we may prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra by means of 
the reduction to absurdity.

Let X denote the subspace of R3 that is the union of the unit sphere S2, 
the unit disk D2 in the 2-y plane, and the portion, call it A, of the z axis lying 
within S2.

(b) Compute the integral homology groups of X .  
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(4 
Fig.2.10 
It is clear that X has the homotopy type of the one point union X1 v X2 
where X1 and X2 are each homeomorphic to the union of the unit sphere 
and the portion of the z axis lying within S2. (See Fig.2.10.) To compute 
~ l ( X 1  
v X2), we take U = X1 V X2 - { p }  and V = X 1  V X2 - (4). Then 
we have U u V = X1 V Xz. Since U n V is contractible, by the Van Kampen, 
al(X1 v X 2 )  is a free product of the groups r l ( U )  and T~(V) 
with respect to 
the homomorphisms induced by the inclusion maps. It is obvious that 

111 
Therefore, ?rl(X) is a free product generated by two generators. We can take 
as generators the closed path classes which are determined by the closed paths 
omp and omq respectively. (See Fig.2.10.) 
(b) Applying the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to the pair (V, V), we see that 
Noting that Hi(X1) M Hi(X2) which are infinite cyclic for i equal to 0,1,2 and 
are zero otherwise, we conclude that 
i = 0, 
otherwise. 
Let X be a path-connected space, f : X

Solution. 
Since X is path-connected, there exists a path C : [0,1] ---+ X such that 
c(0) = 20 and c(1) = 2 1 .  Then Z= f o c is a path connecting f(z0) and f(z1) 
in Y .  For any [a] E ?rI(Y,f(zl)), 
where a is a closed path at f ( ~ l ) ,  
cac 
is a 
closed path at f(z0). By the assumption, there is a closed path h at 20 such 
that f*([h]) = [Z?']. It means that f o h and Zu?' 
are homotopic. Thus 
f o (c-'hc) and a are homotopic, and, consequently, f*([c-'hc]) = [a]. Hence

For any 2-fold covering map p : X -+ 
B, let p-l(z0) = {eo,el}. (See

is not difficult to see, by considering the liftings of the circles a and b in X, 
that, 
in substance, X has only two different types as shown in Fig.2.11. Then it is 
easy to see that they are homotopy equivalent to an 3-leaved rose G3. But the 
spaces X and Y shown in Fig.2.11 are not homeomorphic. Otherwise, suppose 
that f : X -+ Y is a homeomorphism. Then X - {eo) is homeomorphic to 
Y - {f(eo)}. Since X - {eo} is contractible and Y - {f(eO)} is obviously not 
contractible, we come to a contradiction.

Let 2 denote the figure 8 space, Z = X V Y ,  X and Y circles. Let x, y E 
TI(.!?, *) be the elements in 2 defined by X ,  Y ,  where * denotes the vertex 
Fig.2.12 
(a) Let h : ~ ' ( 2 ,  
*) -+ Z/62 be the homomorphism satisfying h(z) = 2 and 
h(y) = 3, and let p : 2 -+ 2 denote the covering space corresponding to the 
kernel of h. ( p * ( ~ 1 ( 2 ,  
*)) = ker(h).) If A is a path component of p - ' ( X )  and 
B is a path component of p-'(Y), how many intersection points of A and B 
are there? (i.e., what is the cardinality of the sat A n B?) 
(b) If G is a finite group, h : ~ ' ( 2 ,  
*) -+ G a surjection, and p : 2 -+ 2 the 
corresponding cover, prove that the number of intersection points of a path 
component A of p-'(X) with a path component B of p-'(Y) divides the order 
of G. 
Solution. 
(a) Since h(z) = 2 and h(y) = 3 and T ~ ( Z , * )  
is generated by 2 and y, it 
follows that the homomorphism h is surjective. Thus ~ l ( 2 ,  
*)/ ker h is isomor- 
phic to the group Z/6Z = Zg. Hence the covering space p : 2 -+ 2 is a 6-fold 
cover. We denote p-'(*) by 
- 
- 
(Indiana) 
p-'(*) = {eO,el,e2,e3,e4,e5}. 
Then, from h(z) = 2, we see that the path component of p-'(X) contains 
exactly the points {eO,ez,e4} of p-'(*) which corresponds to the elements 
{0,2,4} of& respectively. By the same reason, we see that the path component 
of p-'(Y) contains exactly the points {eo, e3} of p-'(*). Since 
p-'(x) n p - ' ( Y )  = p-l(*), 
we conclude that A n B = {eo}. 

114 
(b) Since h is a surjection and G is a finite group, the corresponding cover 
p : 5 + 2 is a finite fold cover. Suppose that h(z) = r and h(y) = s. Then 
r generates a subgroup H1 of G and s generates a subgroup of H2 of G. In a 
similar way as in (a), we see that the number of intersection points of A and 
B is equal to the number of elements in H1 n Ha. By Lagrange’s theorem, it 
divides the order of G.

Represent X as the space obtained by identifying the edges of a hexagon, as 
shown in Fig.2.13. Under the identification the edges a become a circle through 
the point 20. Let y be the center point of the hexagon, and let U = X - {y}. 
Let V be the image of the interior of the hexagon under the identification. 
Then, U and V are open subsets, U ,  V ,  and U n V are arcwise connected, and 
V is simply connected. Let 2 1  be a point in UnV. It is clear that U n V  has the 
same homotopy type with S1, 
and that wl(U nV, 21) is an infinite cyclic group 
generated by y, the homotopy class of a closed path c which circles around the 
point y once (see Fig.2.13.) 
Applying the Van Kampen theorem, we conclude that 
$1 : .Irl(U, 2 1 )  -+ .rrl(X, 21) 
is an epimorphism and its kernel is the smallest normal subgroup containing 
the image of the homomorphism 
41 : rl( u n v, 
zl) 
+ r1(U, zl), 

115 
where 
It is obvious that the circle a is a deformation retract of U. Thus ?rl(U, zo) 
is an infinite cyclic group generated by a and, consequently, 7rl(U,zl) is an 
infinite cyclic group generated by a' = ?-'a?, 
where 7 is the homotopy class 
of a path d from zo to 21. 
It is obvious that dl(r) = ar6. Hence the smallest normal subgroup con- 
taining 41(.lrl(U n V, 21)) is isomorphic to U. Thus we conclude that 
and 41 are homomorphism induced by inclusion maps. 
(b) Since x is a finite 2-dimensional cw complex and T ~ ( X )

its 
universal covering space X is a 6-fold covering space and is also a 2-dimensional 
CW complex. It is well-known that the Euler characteristic X ( 2 )  = 6 X ( X ) .  
But it is easy to see that X ( X )  = 1, hence X ( 2 )  = 6. From H o ( 2 )  M I ,  
HI(%) = 0 and H 2 ( 2 )  x H2(X, X ' ) ,  where 2' is the 1-skeleton of 2,

If X is any topological space and S1 denotes the unit circle in the complex 
plane with its usual topology as a topological group with multiplication given 
by the multiplication of complex numbers, then it is known that the set [ X ,  S1]

(a) Define this group operation explicitly and indicate the group identity 
and how inverses are formed. You do not need to prove your assertions. 
(b) Compute this group explicitly for X = point, S1,

(Indiana) 
Solution. 
s1 as 
Then the multiplication of [X, 
S1] 
is defined by [f] - [g] = [f . g], where the 
map f . g : X + S1 is defined by ( f a  g)(z) = f(z) g(z) for any z E X .  Here 
(a) We denote the homotopy class of a map f : X --+ S1 by [f] and write 
s1 = {e2=io ECT I o 5 8 5 1). 

116 
f(z).g(z) is defined by the multiplication of complex numbers. The identity of 
this multiplication is [el, where the map e : X + S1 is defined by e ( z )  E eZni 
for any 3: E X. The inverse of [ f ]  is the homotopy class of a map f, which is 
defined by f(3:) = l/f(z) for any 3: E X .  
(b) If X = point, then [ X ,  S1] obviously has only one element. So the group 
[ X ,  S1] is trivial. For the case of X = S1, 
one can easily prove that 
[S’, S l ]  x “l(S1) xa. 
For the case of X = S2, it is easy to see that each homotopy class [ f ]  can 
be represented by a map f : S2 -+ S1 which maps the northpole N of S2 to 
the point po = eZUi of S1. 
Then by the facts that S2 is simply connected and 
the universal covering space of S1, R is contractible, one can easily prove that 
[S2, S1] 
M r2(S1) = 0. Now we discuss the case of X = T2 = S1 
x S1. 
For any 
map f from S1 
x S1 
-+ S1 we define two maps f1 and f2 from S1 + S1 by 
fl(6) = f(eZnie,po) and fZ(6) = f(pOlezUie) for any e2nie E S1, 
respectively. 
Then let 4 :  [X,S1] +Z@Z is defined by 4([f]) = (degf1,degfz). We have 
4“fI . [sl) = 4Uf. sl) = (deg(f * 911, deg(f .9)2) 
(deg(f1 * Sl), deg(f2 .92)) 
(deg fl + degg1, deg f 2  + deg 92) 
(deg fll deg f 2 )  + (deg 91 
1 deg 92) 
= 
= 
= 
= 4(V1) + Ng1)- 
Therefore, 4 is a homomorphism from [X, S1] to Z @Z. Note that fl can be 
extended to a map from X to S1, 
still denoted by f1, by 
which is homotopic to f under the homotopy map F : X x I -+ S1 
defined by 
1. 
~ ( ~ 2 r r i 0 ,  
e2niG, t )  = f(e2nif31 e2xit+2xi(l-t)+ 
Thus one can easily prove that 4 is a monomorphism. It is clear that 4 
is a epimorphism, and cosequently q3 is an isomorphism. We conclude that 
[X,S1] %Z@Z.

Prove that if X is locally path connected and simply connected then every 
map X 4 S1 is homotopic to a constant. What can you say if we just assume 
that X is path connected, locally path connected and the fundamental group 
of X is finite? 
Solution. 
Let exp : R -+ 6 denote the exponential covering map, i.e., the universal 
covering space of S1. 
Since X is locally path connected and simply connected, 
7r1(X) = 0, and f*(?rlT1(X)) 
= 0 for any map f : X -+ S1. 
Hence there exists a 
lifting of f, ?: X -+ R such that exp(7) = f .  Since R is simply connected, f 
is homotopic to a constant map Z. Denote the homotopy between 7 and E by 
g. 
Then exp(2) is the homotopy between f and c, i.e., f is homotopic to a 
const ant map. 
Suppose that ?rl(X) is finite. Since ?rl(S1) % Z and f * ( ~ l ( X ) )  
is a finite 
subgroup of ?rl(S1), we see that f * ( ~ l ( X ) )  
must be trivial. So the above 
argument still works in this case, and the same conclusion holds.

If all 3 columns and the first two rows are short exact, then the last row is also 
short exact. 
Solution. 
To prove the exactness at C,, we show that 7 2  is injective. Let c E C3 and 
7 2 ( ~ )  = 0. Since b1 is surjective, there is a b E B3 such that c = b1(b). By 
the commutativity we see ,&(b) E kercl. Hence there is an a2 E A2 such that 
~ ~ ( a 2 )  
= Pz(b). Then since 
(Hamud) 
c2(al(a2)) = Pl(EZ(a2)) = Pl(PZ(b)) = 0 
and C2 is injective, we have al(a2) = 0, i.e., a2 E ker 01 = imcyz. Thus there is 
an a E A3 such that az(a) = a2. Since 
P2(62(a) - b) = P262(a) - h ( b )  = w 2 ( a )  - Pz(b) = E z ( a 2 )  - Pz(b) = 0 
and f ~ 2  is injective, we see &(a) = b. Therefore 
c = S,(b) = 6162(u) = 0. 
Hence 7 2  is injective. 

119 
Now we prove that ker y1 c imy2. For any c E ker 7 1 ,  since ~1 is surjective, 
there is an b E B2 such that c = ~ l ( b ) .  
Thus it is easy to see that Pl(b) E ker C1, 
and consequently that there is an a1 E A1 such that &(u1) = Pl(b). Since 
a1 is surjective, there is an a2 E A2 such that al(u2) = ul. Thus by the 
commutativity, we have b - ~2(u2) E kerpl. Therefore there is a b3 E B3 such 
that p 2 ( b 3 )  = b - ~2(u2). Then 
7 2 ( 6 1 ( b 3 ) )  = E l h ( b 3 )  = &l(b) - E1&2(a2) = c. 
Hence c E imy2. In a similar way we may prove that imy2 c ker 71. Thus the 
exactness at C2 is proved. 
We leave the proof of the exactness at C1 to the reader.

By the PoincarC duality theorem, 
for any i. Thus, since i and 2m + 1 - i have different parity, they appear in

Let Xo = T2 x T2, X1 = RP2 x RP2. Denote by uh the connected sum of h 
projective planes. Then it is well-known that X ( U h )  = 2-h. Let X2 = U3 x 174, 
X3 = U3 x Us, and X4 = S2 x S2. Using the fact that

Let X be a topological space. The suspension E X  of X is defined to be 
the identification space obtained from X x [-1,1] by identifying X x (-1) 
to a point and X x { 1) to another point. For example the sphere S" is the 
suspension of S"-' with the north and south poles corresponding to the two 
identification points. 
Compute the homology of E X  in terms of the homology of X .

Solution. 
Let pl and pa be the identification point respectively. Set U = E X  - {pl} 
and V = C X  - { p z } .  Then U and V are open sets of E X ,  and E X  = U UV. It 
is obviously to see that U and V are contractible spaces and X is a deformation 
retractor of U n V .  By Mayer-Vietoris sequence, we have

When n is even, ( T , s , ~ )  E Zn(c) if and only s = t. So Zn(c) = { ( T , s , s )  E 
Noting that imdn+l = {(O,t,t) E C,} for even n, we have H,(c) = Z  for

When n is odd, ( T , s , ~ )  E & ( c )  if and only if s + t = 0. So Zn(c) is

Construct a CW complex which has the following 2-homology groups: 
( Coz~mbia) 
Solution. 
Denote by X1 the "figure eight space" as shown below, 
Let X2 be the space obtained by attaching two 2-cells to X I ,  one by the 
map fi : S' + 20 and the other by the map f2 : S' + a such that f2(z) = z2. 
Therefore, the image of one 2-cell under f1 is homeomorphic to S2, the 2- 
sphere. It is well-known that H1(X1) = Z$Z, 
which has two generators a and 
b, consider the following diagram

The square is commutative and the level rows are exact. Since 
H ~ ( x ~ ,  
x') = imfl, CB imf2, M z 
CBZ, 

122 
imfllsi. = 0 and imf2Isi. = 2!J, we may see that ima, M 22 and kera, zY. 
Since H1(X2,X1) = 0, we have H1(X2) M Z $ Z 2 .  It is also easy to see that 
Now let X be the space obtained by attaching two 3-cells to X2, one by the 
map g1 : S2 --+ 20 and the other by a map g2 : S2 -+ S2 such that degg2 = 3. 
Then in a similar way as above, we may conclude that the space X satisfies 
the requirements in the problem.

When n = 0, So(q) has 
q + 1 points. Then Hp(So(q)) is a free abelian group of rank q for p equal to 
0 and is zero otherwise. In fact 
S"(q + 1) = S"(q) v S". 
Let a E Sn(q) and b E S". It is easy to see that U = Sn(q + 1) - { u }  has 
the homotopy type of Sn(q) and V = Sn(q + 1) - {b} also has the homotopy 
type of S"(q). It is also clear that Sn(q + 1) = U U V and U n V has the 
homotopy type of Sn(q - 1). Thus, when n > 0, by induction on q and the 
Mayer-Vietoris sequence of the pair (U,V), we may prove that gp(Sn(q)) 
is a 
free abelian group of rank q for p equal to n and is zero otherwise, where fip 
is the reduced homology group.

Build a CW complex X by adding two 2-cells to S1, 
one by the map z --+ z4 
(Indiana) 
and the other by the map z --+ z6. What is the homology of this space? 

123 
Solution. 
Fig.2.14 
X is a %dimensional CW complex with %skeleton K 2  = X, 
l-skeleton 
K1 = S1 and O-skeleton KO = { p } .  K 2  is obtained from K 1  by attaching 
two 2-cells via the maps f and g as indicated in Fig.2.14. K 1  is obtained 
from KO by attaching one l-cell. Let K" = K 2  for n 2 3. Then we have 
a chain complex K = {Cn(K),dn}, where Cn(K) = Hn(Kn,KnA1) 
and d, : 
Cn(K) -+ Cn-l(K) is defined to be the composition of homomorphisms, 
where d, is the boundary operator of the pair (Kn,Kn-l) and j,-l 
is the 
homomorphism induced by the inclusion map. It is well-known that H,(X) M 
Hn(K). It is obvious that H n ( X )  = H,(K) = 0 for n >_ 3. To compute H2(h), 
consider the following diagram: 
HZ(K1) --t HZ(K2) 2 
H2(K2, K1) 2 HI(K1) 2 
HI(K1, KO) 
T f* 
T (f  IS^)* 
H2(E2,S1) 3 Hl(S1) 
The square is commutative and it is well known that f, is a monomorphism 
and 8; is an isomorphism. Noting flsi is the map z -+ z4, we see that the 
image of (flSl)* is 4Z. In the same way we see that the image of (glsi), is 6Z. 
Since 
H ~ ( K ' , K ~ )  
M imf, CB img,, 
it follows that imd, is isomorphic to the subgroup 22 of HI(@), and that 
ker 3, is isomorphic to Z @&. 
Thus, since j 2  is injective, we see that 
H2(K2) 
M imj2 M ker 8, M Z @&. 
It is clear that j1 is an isomorphism. Therefore, imd2 M Z. Noting that 
ker d l  % H1(K1, KO) M 2, we have H1(K) M 2/22 M &. Thus we conclude 
that

Let 
X = {(z,y,z) E R3 I zyz = 0). 
a) Compute H ,  ( X ,  X - { 0)). 
b) Prove that any homeomorphism h : X + X must leave the origin fixed. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
a) Let U = D3 n X ,  where 
D3 = {(z, y, z )  E R3 I z2 + y2 + z2 < 2). 
It is easy to see that U is contractible. Thus 
H,(X,X - (0)) M H,(U, u - (0)) = H,-I(U - (0)) 
for any q. Let S = S2 n X ,  where S2 is the unit 2-sphere. Then S is a 
deformation retract of U - (0). So H,(U - (0)) = g*(S). To compute Z*(S), 
let 
Wl = s - ((O,O, I), (O,O, -1)) 
W2 = s - ((-11 0,0),(1,0,0)). 
and 
Applying the Mayer-Vietoris sequence of the pair (W1, Wz), we see that 
b) Let z be any point of X different from the origin. Similarly we obtain 
Z @Z @Z, if z is in a coordinate axis, 
otherwise. 
H z ( X , X  - { X I )  = 
Let h : X + X be any homeomorphism. Since the local homology groups are 
invariant under homeomorphism, 
H2(X, x - (0)) M H2(X, x - (f(0))). 
From the above results, it follows that f(0) = 0.

a) Write down the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in reduced homology which 
relates the spaces S1 x R1, S1 x R1 - {p}, and a disk D in S1 x R1 about the 
point p. (S1 = 1 - sphere) 
b) Use a) to calculate the homology of S1

Solution. 
a) The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is

f gq(S1 X R1) -+ 
Hg-l(D - { p } )  -+ *...

-
 
b) Since S1 x R1 and D - { p }  have the same homotopy type with S1, it 
follows that 
Hg(S1 x R1) x H,(D - { p } )  x Hq(S1). 
Since D is contractible, the nontrivial part of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is 
0 + g1(D- { p } )  3 
x R1 - { p } )  f gl(S1 x R1) + 0,

which is split exact. Thus we have

Let the real projective plane RP2 be embedded in the standard way in the 
real projective 5-space RP5. Compute Hq (R P 5 /R P 2 ) ,  where RP5/RP2 is 
the space obtained from RP5 by identifying RP2 to a point. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
Since RP5 is compact Hausdorff and RP2 is a strong deformation retract 
of a compact neighborhood of RP2 in RP5, we see that 
H, (RP5/RP2) x Hq(RP5, RP2) for any q. 

126 
It is well-known that

q =  0 , 5 ,  
H,(RP5) =

Let 
Y = {(z1,z2) E R2 I 2 1 2 2  = 0 and 2 2  2 0). 
Prove that Y x R is not homeomorphic to R2. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
Let 
Y x R = { ( 2 1 , 2 2 , 2 3 ) E R 3 1 2 1 2 2 = 0 , 2 2  2 0 ) .  
Then the point 0 = (0, 0,O) E Y x R. To compute the local homology groups 
Hi(Y x R,Y x R -  { 0 } ) ,  i = 0 , 1 , 2 , * . * ,  
we take an open neighborhood of the point 0, U = D3 n (Y x R), where D3 
is an open ball centered at 0. Therefore 
- 
Hi(Y x R,Y x R - (0)) M Hi(U, 
U - (0)) M Hi-l(U - { 0 } ) ,  
because U is contractible. Let X be the space as shown in the following figure 

127 
It is easy to see that X is a deformation retract of U - (0) and that 
H I ( X )  X Z  @Z. Thus 
Hz(Y x R,Y x R -  (0)) EZCBZ. 
It is well-known that for any point p E R2 the local homology group 
H2(R2, R2 - ( p } )  GZ. 
Since the local homology groups are isomorphic under homeomorphism, it 
follows that Y x R is not homeomorphic to R2. 
2312 
Let A be a nonempty subset of X and X u C A  be the union of X with the 
cone of A; that is, X U C A  is obtained from the subset X x (0) U A x [0, 11 of 
X x [0, 11 by identifying A x (1) to a point. 
Prove that the reduced homology group g,(X U CA) is isomorphic to 
H,(X, A ) ,  for every n. 
Solution. 
Let Y = X x (0) U A  x [0,1] and B = A x (1). Then X U C A  = Y/B. 
Let ?r : Y -+ Y / B  be the identification map and yo denote the point ?r(B) in 
Y/B. Let U = A x [$,1] c Y .  Then yo is a strong deformation retract of 
?r(U). Thus, in the exact sequence of the triple (Y/B, ?r(U), yo), 
(Indiana) 
* . *  + Hn(?r(U),YO) + H*(Y/B,yo) 
+ H,(Y/B,?r(U)) 
-+ H,-l(?r(U),YO) -+ * * *  
it follows that H,(?r(U), yo) = 0. Hence, the inclusion map of pairs induces an 
isomorphism 
H*(Y/B,YO) = H*(Y/B,?r(U)). 
H*(Y, U )  M H*(Y - v, u - V ) .  
Let V = A x [i, 11. By the excision property, we have an isomorphism 
Since B is a strong deformation retract of U, 
it follows from the exact sequence 
that 
H*(Y, B )  = H*(Y, U ) .  

128 
Thus, we have 
H * ( Y , B )  M H*(Y - v,u 
- V). 
In a similar way the set T(V) may be excised from the pair ( Y / B ,  n-(V)) to 
give an isomorphism 
Now the restriction of the map n- gives a homeomorphism of pairs 
n- : (Y - v, u - V )  + ( Y / B  - T(V), T(V) - .(V)), 
and so an isomorphism of their homology groups. All of these combine to give 
an isomorphism 
H*(Y/B, yo) M H*(Y, B). 
Since Y admits obviously a strong deformation retraction onto X x (0) 
which maps B onto A x { 0 } ,  we have 
H,(Y, B )  M H,(X, A). 
On the other hand, from the exact sequence of the pair (Y/B, yo), it follows 
that 
H*(Y/B,yo) 
x H*(Y/B) = G,(X UCA). 
Therefore, H,(X U CA) is isomorphic to H,(X, A )  for every n.

For any topological space X let EX denote its (unreduced) suspension. 
(EX is the quotient space (X x [0,1]/ -, where - denotes the equivalence 
relation generated by requiring that (2, t )  - (y, s) if s = t = 0 or s = t = 1.) 
Iff : X + Y is a map, let Cf : C X  -+ C Y  be the map of suspensions induced 
by the map ( ~ , t )

(f(z),t) 
of X x [0,1]. 
(i) Prove that if f : X -+ Y is a homotopy equivalence then so is Cf. 
(ii) Using only the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms (Homotopy, Exactness, Ex- 
cision, Dimension) for a homology theory prove that Hi (EX) 
is naturally iso- 
morphic to Ei-l(X). 
(Here Hi denotes reduced singular homology.) 
(Indiana) 

1 29 
Solution. 
(i) Denote by rIx : X x I + C X  the quotient map, and by po, pl the 
equivalence classes of (z, 0) and (z, l), z E X, respectively. Let f : X + Y be 
a continuous map. By the definition we see that 
Cf = rIy 0 (f x id) 0 IIXl, 
where id : I + I is the identity map. Suppose that g : X + Y is another 
continuous map which is homotopic to f by a homotopy G : X x I + Y 
such that G(z,O) = f(z) and G(z, 1) = g(z) for any z E X .  Then define 
c : (X x I) x I -+ 
CY by 
Let H : EX x I --t CY be a map defined by H ( Z ,  s) = E(II&'(%), 
s) for any 
(2, s) E EX x I ,  where, if Z = po or p l ,  lI,'(Z) 
means any point (z,O) or (z, 1). 
It is easy to check that H is well-defined and continuous. It is also easy to see 
that H(Z, 0) = Cf(Z) and H(E, 1) = Eg(Z). Therefore Cf is homotopic to Cg, 
and consequently it follows that if f : X + Y is a homotopy equivalence then 
so is Cf. 
(ii) Let 
1

2 
3 
u = {rIx(z,t) 1 t > -} 
v = {rIx(z,t) 1 t < -}. 
and 
It is obvious that U and V are both open sets of EX and that U and V 
are both contractible. Hence r?.i(U) = g,(V) = 0 for all i. It follows from 
the homology sequence of the pair (EX, U )  that fii(CX) M Hi(EX, U ) .  Let 
W = {IIx(z, t )  1 t 2 2/3}. Then 
c U .  By the excision property we have 
It is easy to see that U - W has the same homotopy type of X .  On the other 
hand, from the homolopy sequence of the pair (V, U - W )  we see that 
Hi(V, u - W )  M E&'(U - W). 
Thus we conclude that k i ( C X )  
k*-l(X).

Consider the following commutative diagram of abelian groups in which 
the row and column are exact sequences. 
Suppose that y and Po are surjective. Prove that a3 is injective. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
Let a3 E A3 such that cyg(a3) = 0. Then from the exactness there is an 
a2 E A2 such that az(u2) = a3. Since y is surjective, there is an a1 E Al such 
that y(a1) = /32(a2). Hence by the commutativity we have 
so al(a1) - a2 E kerP2, and there is a bl E B1 such that P l ( b 1 )  = a(a1) - a2. 
Since PO is surjective, there is a bo E Bo such that Po(b0) = bl. Once again by 
the exactness we have 0 = PlPo(b0) = Pl(bl), which means that al(a1) - a2 = 
0. Hence a3 = ~ 2 ( a 2 )  = a2al(al) = 0. It means that kerag = 0, i.e., a3 is 
injective.

Suppose that a topological space X is expressed as the union U U V of two 
open path-connected subspaces such that U n V  is path connected, H1(U) = 0, 
and the inclusion UnV + V induces a surjective homomorphism H1(UnV) + 
H1(V). (Here H denotes singular homology.) 
a) Prove that H 1 ( X )  = 0. 

131 
b) Give an example to show that the analogous assertion becomes false in 
general if H1 is replaced everywhere by Hz. 
Solution. 
(Indiana) 
a) Consider the Mayer-Vietoris sequence of the pair (U, V)

H ~ ( U  
n v) % H ~ ( u )  
CB H ~ ( v )  
5 H ~ ( x )  
+ H ~ ( U  
n v). 
Since U n V is path-connected, Eo(U n V )  = 0. It means H 1 ( X )  = im$*. By 
the hypothesis, d* is surjective so that 
Therefore im& = 0, i.e., H1(X) = 0. 
b) Let X = S2, the unit 2-sphere7 
1 
u = {(zclg,z) E s2 I z > - 5 )  
and 
1 
2 
v = {(z, y, z )  E s2 I z < -}. 
Then X = U U V .  It is obvious that U ,  V and U n V are path-connected 
and that H z ( U )  = H2(V) = 0. So the homomorphism Hz(U n V )  + H z ( V )  
induced by the inclusion map is surjective. But H2 ( X)  M Z.

Let 
D" = {z E R" 1121 5 1) 
denote the standard unit ball in Euclidean space Rn, and 
denote the standard (n- 1)-sphere. Suppose that f : Dn 
--t D" is a continuous 
map such that the restriction of f to S"-l is a homeomorphism from S"-l to 
s n - 1  . Prove that f is surjective. 
Solution. 
We use the reduction to absurdity. Suppose that there is a point 20 E Dn 
such that zo @ f(D"). By the assumption, we see that 20 E D" - 9 - l .  
(Indiana) 

132 
Therefore Sn-' is a deformation retract of D" - (20). Let T : D" - ( 2 0 )  -+ 
Sn-' be a retraction. Then g = r o f is a continuous map from Dn to S"-l 
and gIs.-1 
: 9 - l  -+ S"-' is just the restriction of f to Sn-', which is 
a homeomorphism. 
Therefore 
g o i : Sn-' -+ 
Sn-' is a homeomorphism. Hence 
Let i : S"-l -+ 
Dn be the inclusion map. 
(g 0 i)* : Hn-l(S"-') 
-+ H,-'(S"-') 
is an isomorphism. But ( g o  i)* = g* o i, and i, : Hn-1(Sn-') 
--t Hn-l(Dn) is 
obviously a trivial homomorphism because of Hn-l(Dn) = 0, and consequently 
(g o i)* is trivial. This is a contradiction.

Let X be a connected CW complex with two 0-cells, three 1-cells, three 
2-cells, and no higher-dimensional cells. Assume H1(X) x Z @Z/3. 
Compute 
the Euler characteristic of X and determine (with proof) all possibilities for 
H2(X). 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
The Euler characteristic of X ,  X ( X )  = 2 - 3 + 3 = 2. On the other hand, 
X(X) = rankHo(X) - rankHl(X) + rankH,(X). 
Therefore rankHz(X) = 2. Let X k  denote the k-skeleton of X .  By the assump- 
tion, we see that H 3 ( X 3 , X 2 )  = 0, and H 2 ( X 2 , X 1 )  =Z$Z@Z. Therefore 
H2(X) M ker{d, : H2(X2, X ' )  --t H1(X1, XO)}, 
where d, is the composition of homomorphisms 
H2(X2, X ' )  3 H1(X1) 2; H1(X1,XO). 
Thus because H 2 ( X 3 , X 1 )  is free abelian, H 2 ( X )  is also a free abelian group 
of rank 2, i.e., H2(X) ZZ $Z.

It is well-known that 
iYk(X;Z) M ker dk/imd"'

Hk+l(X;Z) M ker dk+1/imdk+2. 
By the hypothesis, 
H ' + l ( X k + l , X k )  zz. 
We choose a generator a in Hk+l(Xk+l,Xk). We claim that &+'(a) # 0. 
Otherwise we would have imd'+l = 0. Therefore 
H k ( X ; Z )  M ker dk c H k ( X k ,  X"-'). 
But it is well-known that Hk(Xk,Xk-l) is a free abelian group, and, conse- 
quently, kerdk is trivial or free abelian. It means that H k ( X ; Z )  is not a non- 
trivial finite group and contradicts the hypothesis. Thus we have d'+'(a) # 0. 
It follows that kerd"'

By the excision 
&(X, x - (O,O, 0,O)) M Hi(U, u - (O,O, 0,O)) 
for all i. It is obvious that U is contractible and that U - (0, 0, 0,O) has a 
deformation retract C U D, where 
and 
D = { ( ~ 1 , 2 2 , 2 3 , 2 4 )  E R4 I 24 = 0, 2: + 2: + 2: = 1). 
(See Fig.2.15) 
Fig. 2.15 
Let Wi = C U D - {pl,p2) and W2 = C U D - {p3,p4}. (See Fig.2.15.) 
Then W1 and W2 are open subsets of C U D and W1 u W2 = C u D. It is clear 
that both C and D are homeomorphic to the unit sphere S2 and that D and 
C are deformation retracts of W1 and Wz respectively. It is also clear that S1 
is an deformation retract of W1 n Wz. Therefore, applying the Mayer-Vietoris 
sequence to the pair (W1, W2), we see that 
2 = 0, 
other wise. 
From the homology sequence of the pair (U, U - (0, O,O, 0)), we see that 
Hi+l(U, u - (O,O, 0,O)) = Hi(U - (O,O, 0,O))

Let X be a path connected and locally path connected space and let x E X .  
Let Y = S1 x S1

map f : X 
-+ Y induces the trivial map f* : Hi(X,Z) + H i ( Y , I )  for all i 
different from 0 and 2. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
It is easy to see that R2 x S2 is the universal covering space of Y .  By the 
Kunneth theorem, we have 
It is clear that 
Rl(S1 x s1 x S1) = “l(T2) @ “l(S2) = a  $a. 
Since ?rl(X, x) is finite, the homomorphism f* : R ~ ( X ,  
z) --+ R ~ ( Y ,  
f(z)) must 
be trivial. Therefore, we may lift f to a map 7 
: X -+ R2 x S2 such that 
a o f = f, where R : R2 x S2 -+ Y is the covering map. Hence we have

f* = R, 0 f* : Hl(X,Z) -+ Hi(Y,Z)

By the assumptions, we have 6P = 7a and &a’ = 6’7. Therefore, we have 
(6’6 - &)(P,a’a) = 6’6P - &a’a = 6’ya - 6’ya = 0. 

1 37 
It follows that im(P,a’a) c ker(6’S - E ) .  Let (c, e) E ker(6’6 - E ) ,  i.e., S’6(c) - 
E(e) = 0. By the assumptions, we have im(a,p) = ker(y - 6) and im(a’,y) = 
ker(c - a’). Thus, noting that 
( e ,  6(c)) E ker(E - S’), 
we see that there exists a b E B such that a’(b) = e and y(b) = 6(c). Hence we 
have (b, c) E ker(y - 6). Therefore, there exists an a E A such that a(.) = b 
and p(a) = c, and, consequently, 
(c, e )  = (0, 
a’a)(u) E im(0, a’a). 
It means that

The exactness at C @ E is proved.

Let X be a non-empty compact Hausdorff space and f : X

X be a 
continuous map. Prove that there exists a non-empty closed subset A of X 
such that f ( A )  = A. Give an example to show that compactness is essential 
for this assertion. 
Solution. 
Let F1 = f ( X ) .  Then F1 is a non-empty closed subset of X. We define 
Fn+l = f(Fn) 
inductively for n E Z+. It is clear that {Fn,n E Z+} is a 
sequence of non-empty closed subsets in X and that

Since X is compact, we see that the subset A = n F, is a non-empty closed 
subset of X .  We claim that f ( A )  = A holds. 
We give an example to show that compactness is essential for this assertion. 
Let X = (0,1] and f : X --+ X is defined by f(z) = i z  for z E X. Suppose 
that a non-empty closed A of X satisfies f ( A )  = A. Then there would exist an 
2 0  E A such that z 5 zo for any z E A. In fact zo = sup z. Since f ( A )  = A 
and zo E A, there would exists an z1 E A such that f(z1) = 20, i.e., 20 = 521. 
Therefore zo 2 z1 = 220, which is a contradiction.

Recall that 
H3(S3;Z) x H3(RP3;Z) MZ. 
(RP" is n-dimensional real projective space.) Prove that there is no function 
f : S3 + RP3 inducing an isomorphism on the third homology. 
Solution. 
It is well-known that S3 is the 2-fold universal covering space of RP3. 
Let 7~ : S3 + RP3 denote the universal covering map. Then it is clear that 
the degree of 7r is equal to 2. Let f be a function from S3 to RP3. Since 
7r1(S3) = { 0 } ,  there is a lifting of f, f :  S3 + S3 such that 7 r f =  f .  Denote 
by a and b the generators of H3(S3) and H3(RP3) respectively. Then we have 
f*(a) = 7r*(f*(a)) = degf.r,(a) = 2-deg f .b, 
because deg f E Z, 
it is obvious that f* is not an isomorphism.

(b) Using part a, show that X is not homeomorphic to R2. 
(c) Prove or disprove: X is homotopy equivalent to R2. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) In fact, X = 7 ~ 1  U 7r2 where 7r1 is the plane y = 0 and 7r2 is the plane 
z = 0. Denote by A and B the unit circle in 7rl and a2 respectively. Then 
it is easy to see that A U B is a deformation retract of X - (O,O, 0). Take 
U = A U  B - (0, 0 , l )  and V = A U  B - (0, 0, -1). Therefore, U and V are both 
contractible, U U V = A U B and U n V has four path components which are 
all contractible. Applying the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to the pair (U, V), we 
see that 
H1(X - ( O , O , O ) )  x H1(A U B )  =Z $Z $Z. 
(b) Suppose that there exists a homeomorphism f : X + R2. Then 
flx-(o,o,o) : X - (O,O, 0 )  + R2 - f ( O , O ,  0) is also a homeomorphism, which

(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) Let xo E S2, x1 E S5. Then S2 is obtained by attaching a 2-cell to 
20, and S5 is obtained by attaching a 5-cell to XI. Denote by S2 V S5 the one 
point union of S2 and S5, which can be considered as the space obtained by 
attaching a 2-cell and a 5-cell to the point (20, 
21) E S2 x S5. It is easy to see 
that S2 x S5 is homeomorphic to the space obtained by attaching a 7-cell to 
S2 V S5. Therefore the CW structure on S2 x S5 has a 0-cell, a 2-cell, a 5-cell 
and a 7-cell. Hence it is obvious that Hi(S2 x S5) is an infinite cyclic group 
for i equal to 0, 2, 5, and 7, and is zero otherwise. 
(b) Let X = S 2 x S 5 - { p l , p 2 } ,  U = S2xS5-{p1}andV = S2xS5-{p2}. 
Then U ,  V are both open sets of S2 x S5 and UnV = X, and UUV = S2 x S5. 
It is easy to see that S2VS5 is a deformation retract of both U and V .  Applying 
the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to the pair (U, V) and using the fact that

From the homology sequence of the pair ( S 2  x S2,A), using the above result

Since &(A) = 0, H,(S2 
x S2,A) = 0 for i equal to 0 and 1. By the exactness, 
we have H3(S2 x S 2 ,  A) M keri, and H2(S2 x S 2 ,  A) M Z @Z/irni,, where i, 
is the homomorphism induced by the inclusion map i : A - S2 x S2.

Let

Then the space X may be viewed as a space obtained from X* by attaching 
a 1-cell. It is clear that Hi(X, 
X”) 
is infinite cyclic for i equal to 1 and is zero 
otherwise. It is easy to see that X’ has the homotopy type of 5’. Thus from 
the homology sequence of the pair ( X ,  X”) 
we conclude that Hi(X) 
is infinite 
cyclic for i equal to 0,1,2 and is zero otherwise.

Define the “unreduced suspension” CX of a space X to be the quotient

have T* o i, = id : H1(T2) - H1(T2). In other words, we have the following

C = l,, the identity of C. By the definition of g*(A), we see that

Let F : kerg*(h) -+ ker h be defined by F(l,, a )  = a. It is easy to see that F

The universal covering of the one point union S1VS2 is shown as in Fig.2.18.

V S2 - {the antipodal point of p l }  
and 
V = S2 V S1 
V S2 - {the antipodal point of p 2 }  
(see the above figure). Then it is easy to see that S1 is a deformation retract

The following sequence is exact:

where A is defined by 
A(a’, b) = ;;(a’) - Pn(b) 
for any (a’, b) E A; @ B,. We give the proof of exactness at Bh as follows. 
Let u E ker(6, 07;lojA). 
Then 7;’ o j L ( u) E ker6,. Due to the exactness 
at C,, there exists a b E B, such that jn(b) = 7;’ oj;(u), and consequently, 
7, .jn(b) = jA(b). From the commutativity, we have j ;  o@,(b) = jk(u). Thus 
Pn(b) - u E kerj; and there exists an a’ E A; such that i;(a’) = Pn(b) - u. It 
means that 
u = P,(b) - i;(d) = A(-a’, -b). 

150 
So ker(6, o 7;’ o j ; )  C imA. 
Now we prove 
imA c ker(6, o 7;’ ojk). 
Suppose that u E imA, i.e., u = ih(a’) - P,(b) for some a’ E Ah and 6 E B,. 
Since j; o ih = 0 and j; o Pn = 7, o j, , it is easy to see that 
6, 0 7,’ 0 j L ( U )  = -6, 0 j,(b) = 0. 
Thus the exactness at B; is proved.

Since X x (0) = Y /  - is homeomorphic to Y and is a deformation retract of

DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY OF CURVES

Let a ( s )  be a closed plane curve. Define the diameter d, of a(s) to be 
Now assume that the curvature k(s) 2 1 for all s. 
i) For any N EZ+ sketch an example of such an a(.) with d, > N .  
ii) Assume further that a is a simple closed curve. Prove that d, 5 2 (or 
some other constant independent of a; 2 is the best possible such constant). 
Solution. 
(Indiana) 
i) The following is an example of such an a ( s )  with k ( s )  2 1 and d, > N .  
"t 
Fig.3.1 
ii) From the hypothesis that k(s) 2 1 for all s, we know that the simple 
closed curve a is an oval. 
For every oval, by Blaschke, if we take the origin 0 as shown in the figure 
and denote by p(0) the distance from 0 to the tangent 1 at the point (z,y) 
of the oval, where the oval is counterclockwise orientated and 8 denotes the 
oriented angle from the z-axis to I, then the oval can be parameterized by 8 
as follows 
.(e) = p(e) sin 6 + p'(0) cos 8, 
y(e) = -p(e) cos e + pye) sine. 

154 
p(8) is called the support function of the oval. From this we can conclude that, 
by direct computation, the relative curvature of the oval is k,.(8) = (p(8) + 
(8) ) - 1. 
Fig.3.2 
Now we can prove a more general result of Blaschke: 
Let two ovals C and C1 in a plane be internally tangent at a point 0. 
Suppose that, at every pair of points P and PI where C and C1 have the 
same tangent orientation, the curvatures of C and C1 satisfy the inequality 
kl(Pl) 5 k(P). Then the domain encircled by C1 must contain the domain 
encircled by C. 
Fig.3.3 
In fact, take the tangent point 0 of C and C1 as the origin, and their 
common tangent line as the z-axis. Let p(8) and p l ( 8 )  be the support functions 
of C and C1, respectively. 
From the above, we can say that the support 
function p(8) must be the solution to the following initial value problem of 
ODE 
because p’(8) is exactly the distance from 0 to the normal line of C at point 
(.(a), y(8)). Hence, p(8) can be uniquely determined by k(8) = k,.(8) of C, 

155 
Analogously, for the curve C1, we also have the similar expression of pl(8). 
Thus, 
By the hypothesis, we know that 
As for the sign of sin(8 - b), firstly, if 0 5 8 5 x, then owing to 0 5 4 5 8, 
we have sin(8 - 4) 2 
0. Therefore, pl(8) - p(8) 2 0. Secondly, if x 5 8 5 2x, 
we make the reflections of the oval C and C1 with respect to their common 
tangent line at 0 and reverse the orientation of the z-axis. Then we can get 
pl(8) - p(8) 2 0, where 8 and its corresponding original 8 satisfy 8 + 8 = 27~. 
Hence, we always have pl(8) 2 
p(8). Noticing that every oval is the envelope of 
all its tangent lines, we see that the domain encircled by C must be contained 
in the domain encircled by C1. The assertion of Blaschke is proved. 
If we take a circle with radius 1 and centered at a(sg) + N(so) as C1, and 
take a as C, 
then ii) follows immediately from the above assertion.

Let a be a regular C" curve in lR3 with nonvanishing curvature. Suppose 
the normal vector N ( t )  is proportional to the position vector; that is, N ( t )  = 
c(t)a(t) for all t, where c is a smooth function. Determine all such curves. 
Solution. 
For convenience, we assume that the parameter t is the arc length of the 
curve a. Differentiating both sides of the equality N ( t )  = c(t)cr(t) with respect 
to t ,  we have, by the Frenet formula, 
(Indiana) 
Thus we can immediately obtain k ( t )  = constant, T ( t )  = 0 and c ( t )  = -k. 
Therefore, by the fundamental theorem of the theory of curves, we know that 
the curve a must be a circle (or a part of it).

3103 
A surface S c lR3 is called triply ruled if at every p E S we can find 
three open line segments L1, Lz, L3 lying in S such that L1 n L2 n L3 = {p}. 
Determine all triply ruled surfaces. 
Solution. 
If S is a triply ruled surface, then, by the hypothesis, there are three differ- 
ent asymptotic directions at every point of s. Observe that every asymptotic 
direction (du, dv) satisfies 
(Indiana) 
L(u, w)du2 + 2M(u, v)dudv + N(u, v)dv2 = 0, 
where L(u, v), M(u, v), N(u, v) are the coefficients of the second fundamental 
form of S at point p(u,v). Noticing that the above equation is of 2nd order 
with respect to du : dw and it has two roots, we obtain L(u, w) = M ( u ,  v) = 
N(u, v) = 0 for all (u, v). In other words, every point of S is a planar point. 
Therefore, S must be a plane (or a part of it). 
3104 
Let y : (a,b) 4 
R3 be smooth with [y’l = 1 and curvature k and torsion 
7, both nonvanishing. Denote the Frenet frame by { T , N , B } .  Assume there 
exists a unit vector a E R3 with 
T . a = constant = cos a. 
a) Show that a circular helix is an example of such a curve. 
b) Show that N . a = 0. 
c) Show that k / r  = constant = k tana. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
a) Let a circular helix be parameterized as follows 
y(s) = (Tcosws,Tsinws, hws), 

157 
where T ,  h, w = (r2 + h2)-i are all constants. Then it is easy to verify that s 
is the arc length parameter. Hence 
T ( s )  = (-rwsinws,rwcosws,hw). 
If we take a = (O,O, l), then T ( s )  . a = hw = constant. 
b) Differentiating Tea = constant with respect to the arc length parameter 
s, we obtain k ( s ) N ( s )  .a = 0, from which follows N ( s ) .  a = 0 for all s E (a, b). 
c) By the property of b), we may assume that the constant vector 
a =  cosa.T(s) f s i n a . B ( s ) .  
Differentiating the above equality with respect to s, we have 
0 = (cos a 3 k( s) f 
sin a . T( s))N (s) . 
Thus, for all s E (a,b), k ( s ) / ~ ( s )  
= & tana. 
3105 
Show that if y is a geodesic on the cone t = d m ,  
(z) y) E R2\{0, 0)) 
then y intersects itself at most a finite number of times. 
Solution. 
If we cut the cone along a generator 1 and develop it into a plane, then the 
cone becomes an infinite sector without the vertex, and the geodesic y becomes 
a straight line on the developed infinite sector. Noticing that the central angle 
of the sector is f i r ,  an obtuse angle, and the image of y on the sector must 
be one of the following three cases: 
(Indiana) 
a generator, 
a straight line never intersecting the generator 1, 
two rays which start from the generator I ,  
then we can conclude that y never intersects itself. 
3106 
Let y : (a,b) 4 R3 be a C" 
curve parameterized by arc length, with

# 0 for all 
s E (a,b), and let T and N denote the unit tangent and normal vectors to

y. The curve y is called a Bertrand curve if there exists a regular curve 
7 : (a,b) + IR3 such that for each s E (a,b) the normal lines of y and 7 at s 
are equal. In this case, 7 is called the Bertrand mate of y and we can write 
y(s) = y(s) + T N ( s )  for some T = ~ ( s )  
E IR. (Note that s might not be an arc 
length parameter for 7.) 
(a) Prove that r is constant. 
(b) Prove that if y is a Bertrand curve (with r as above), then there exists

Solution. 
(Indiana) 
(a) From y(s) = y(s) + r ( s ) N ( s )  it follows by differentiation that 
Taking inner products at both sides with N ( s )  = fN(s), we have that r’(s) = 
0, namely r = const. 
(b) From (a), now we have

T ( s )  = -(1-

then by differentiating with respect to s, we obtain

dZ 
ds 
k(s)N(s)- = a’(s)T(s) + (a(s)k(s) + b(s).r(s))N(s) + b’(s)B(s).

ds

Therefore, there exists a constant C such that rk(s) + CT(S) = 1 for all s E

(a, b). 
there exist constants T I ,  rg, C1, C2 such that for all s E (a, b), 
r1k(s) + ClT(9) = 1, 
r2k(s) + C27(5) = 1. 

159 
Because the non-zero constants T I ,  1-2 are not equal, the above system of linear 
algebraic equations has solution k ( s )  = const, ~ ( s )  
= const. Hence y must be 
a circular helix.

is the Fkenet frame field along z(s), and a(s), b(s), c(s) are suitable functions 
to be ascertained later. Differentiating (z(s), z(s)) = R2 with respect to s, we 
have (z(s),T(s)) = 0, from which it follows that u(s) = 0, Vs. Differentiating 
(z(s),T(s)) = 0 with respect to s again, we obtain

Let M c R3 be the torus obtained by rotating the circle ((0, y, z )  : (y -

Is this curve a geodesic on M? Explain without long computations. 
Solution. 
follows 
(Indiana) 
Observe that the geodesic curvature of a curve on M can be computed as 
k, = f k ( t )  sin€J(t), 
where k ( t )  is the curvature of the curve, and @(t) 
is the angle between the 
normal of M and the principal normal of the curve at the point corresponding 
to the parameter t. 
Then, the curve c(t) is not a geodesic on M ,  because neither the top circle 
is a straight line, nor its principal normal, which is orthogonal to the z-axis, is 
parallel to the normal of M along c(t), which is parallel to the z-axis.

Let y : [0,1] -+ lR3 be a C" curve with 1i.l = 1 and nonvanishing curvature. 
(a) Show that y lies in a plane. 
(b) What happens if the curvature is allowed to vanish at a point? 
Assume the torsion 7 = 0. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) 1i.l = 1 implies that the curve is parameterized by arclength s. From 
the Frenet formula we know that the binormal vector field of y, denoted by B ,  
is constant. Thus, -$(y(s)B) = 0, which means that y ( s ) B  = constant, that 
is, y lies in a plane. 
(b) The vanishing curvature at point SO means ? ( S O )  = 0, i.e., SO is a 
stationary point of y's tangent vector field. If the point is the strict extreme 
value point of the tangent vector field, then it is an inflection point of the curve

where O(zp) is the angle between the normal of M and the principal normal 
of the circle of latitude at P. Since every circle of latitude on M is a line of 
curvature, then the corresponding normal curvature Ic, is a principal curvature. 
Thus, Ic, = *$-J implies that cos8(zP) = f l ,  that is, the curve {(z,O, f(z)) : 
z E IR} has a tangent parallel to the z axis at P. Namely, f'(zp) = 0. 

162 
Besides, the meridian passing P is also a line of curvature. Its curvature 
Ic at P is just the other principal curvature of M .  Thus, the second possible

0 E lR3. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
If the position vector a(.) is always a linear combination of the binormal 
and normal vectors, then (T(s), a(.)) 
0. Integrating the obtained equality, 
we have (a(s),a(s)) = const. Therefore, if a ( s )  passes through the origin, we

of a, denoted by &, has the same geodesic curvature kg(s) 3 1. Thus the

more, differentiating

which implies that

Suppose y(t) parameterizes a space curve with curvature function K ( t ) .  
Define a new curve 7 by setting, for each t E lR, r(t) := cy(t/c), where c E lR

Let a : (a, b) + lR3 be a smooth curve with nonvanishing curvature. 
i) Show that if the torsion of a vanishes identically then there is a plane 
?r c lR3 containing a, that is, a(t) E ?r for all t E (a,b). Is ?r unique? 
ii) Is the conclusion of i) still true if the curvature is allowed to vanish at 
a single point c E (a,b)? [Of course, the torsion is not defined at c, but is 
assumed to be zero at all other points.] 
Solution. 
i) Let a be reparameterized by arclength s; namely, suppose a = a(t(s)), 
s E ( ~ 1 , s ~ )  
with t ( s 1 )  = a, t ( s g )  = b. The condition k # 0 means that we can 
define the F’renet frame field {T, N ,  B }  along a. Then the hypothesis T 
0 
implies that B is a constant vector field. Hence, $(all?) = 0, from which 
follows 
(a(t(s)), 
B) = const = (a(t(so)), 
B). 
Therefore, the plane ?r : ( p  - a(t(sg)), B) = 0 contains the curve a. Obviously, 
the connectedness of a and the smoothness of the Frenet frame field imply 
that T is unique. 
ii) If the curvature k is allowed to vanish at a single point c E (a, b), then, 
according to the above discussion, a(t), t E ( a , c )  must be on a plane T I ;  and 
a(t), t E (c,b) must be on another plane a2. Of course, maybe, ?rl # x2. A 
counterexample is as follows. Let

Let a and p be two regular curves in lR3. The curve ,f3 is called an involute 
of a if for all t ,  P(t) lies on the line tangent to a at a(t) and (a’(t),,f3’(t))

Show that every involute of a generalized helix a is a plane curve. (Recall that 
a is a generalized helix if for some constant vector u # 0, (u,a’(s)) E const, 
where s is arclength for a.) 
Solution. 
For convenience, let a and ,B be parameterized by their arclength s and 
s1 respectively, and let s, s1 represent their corresponding points. Then we 
may assume ,B(sl) = a(s) + X(s)T(s). Differentiate the equation with respect 
to s. Using the Frenet formulas and the hypothesis (T(s),Tl(sI)) = 0, we 
can ascertain that P(s1) = a ( s )  + (so - s)T(s). Differentiate the obtained 
expression for ,B successively. Noting that a being a generalized hrelix implies

namely, (a(s) - a(so),n) = 0, which means that the curve a is contained by a

i) Let S2 = { ( 2 1 , 2 2 , 2 3 )  E B3 : 2: + xi + 22 = l}, and B2 be the 
21 o 2 2  plane. For every p E R2, its coordinates with respect to the z1 and 
2 2  axes are denoted by (u,v). Suppose that x : S2\{N} -+ B2 is the stereo- 
graphic projection from the north pole of S2 into the plane lR2, which maps 
(21, ~ 2 ~ 2 3 )

Then the metric of S2\{N} can be expressed by 
4(du2 + dv2) 
ds2 = (22 + 212 + 1)2' 
Now, using the pull back of ds2 by (x-')*, we can obtain a 2-dimensional 
Riemannian manifold (B2, 
(x-')*ds2). Thus, the map x : (S2\{N}, ds2) -+ 
(B2,(x-')*ds2) is an isometry. Since all great circles which do not pass 
through the north pole are closed geodesics on S2\{N}, then their images 
are simple closed geodesics on (E2, 
(x-l)*ds2).

section, then its curvature at z = 0 is L(0) = lk,(O, &)I

among k(O), kn(O, &) and the geodesic curvature k,(O, &)

the Gaussian curvature of M 2  at x = 0 is K(0) = -25; or more directly,

Choose the unit outward pointing normal as the orientation of M .  Let

Let S be a surface diffeomorphic to the ordinary 2-sphere. Suppose there is 
a C" metric of positive curvature on S for which there exist two simple closed 
geodesics y1 and 7 2 .  Show that y1 and yz must intersect. 
Solution. 
(Indiana) 
Here we assume the Jordan curve theorem. 
If y1 and yz do not intersect, then y1 and 72 encircle a domain D such 
that the Euler characteristic x ( D )  = 0 and d D  = 71 uyz. Applying the global 
Gauss-Bonnet formula to the domain D c S and noting that y1 and y2 are 
geodesics of S, we have 
K d c  = 27rx(D) = 0, 
which contradicts the assumption of positive curvature.

Let D be the disk { ( x ,  y )  E lR2 : x2 + y2 < i} and let 0 = (0,O) E D. Let

by 
where h(r, 0) = r2[1 - 2r2 + r4 sin2 01'. 

175 
(a) Prove that this metric extends to a smooth metric on D. 
Hint. Use a smooth coordinate system. 
(b) Show that line segments in D which pass through the origin (suitably 
parameterized) are geodesics. 
Solution. 
(a) Set 
(Indiana) 
x = rCOS8, 
{ y = r sin 8. 
Then 
= r. So, on D\{O}, we can choose (x, y) as the coordinates. From 
dx = cos Bdr - r sin 8d8 
{ dy = sin 8dr + T cos 8d8 
dr = cos dx + sin 8dy 
{ d8 = (cos 8dy - T sin adz). 
follows 
Hence the metric of D\{O} may be rewritten as 
ds2 = dr2 + h(r,8)de2 
= [cos2 8 + (1 - 2r2 + 4r4 sin2 19)~ 
sin2 8)dz2 
+2 cos 8 sin 8[l - (1 - 2r2 + 4r4 sin2 8)2]dxdy

giidx2 + 2lii2dxdy + li22.d~~.

When r + 0, we see that &I = 1 + o(r), g12 = o(T), Z22 = 1 + o(r), and 
%%i 
az = o( l), $& = o( 1). Therefore, this metric can extend to a smooth metric 
on D. 
(b) For any line segment I in D, we can express 2\{O} as the union of 
Il = {(r,e) : 0 < r < :,8 = O0} and l2 = {(r,8) : 0 < T < :,8 = B0 + T } .  
Using ds2 = dr2 + h(r,8)d82, we know that both l1 and 12 are geodesics in 
D\{O}. If we use the extended metric, the geodesic curvature k, of I must be 
a continuous function of the coordinates. Because 11 and 12 are geodesics by 
either metric, we know that kgIo = 0. Hence, as a whole line segment, 1 is a 
geodesic, t 00.

i) Let M be a surface (without boundary) in lR3. Suppose M is inside a 
ball of radius R and suppose a point p E M is on the boundary sphere. Show 
that the Gauss curvature of M at p is 2 &. 
ii) Show that there is no closed minimal surface in lR3. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
i) The surface M and the sphere S2, the boundary of the ball, have the 
same tangent plane at p . Let a be a normal plane of M and S2 at p .  Then, 
using the local canonical forms of the normal section curves M n 7~ and S2 n 7~ 
at p ,  one can easily show that, at p ,  the curvature of M n T is not less than 
that of S2 na = S1, 
and p is an elliptic point of M .  Hence the Gauss curvature 
of M at p is greater than or equal to 6. 
ii) Suppose that M is a closed minimal surface in lR3. Then there is a 
family of spheres that contain the surface M inside and have a fixed center. 
Ler R be the infimum of their radii. Then, there must be at least one common 
point of M and the sphere with radius R and centered at the fixed point. Using 
the result of i), one concludes that the Gauss curvature of M at p ,  K ( p )  2 &-. 
But it contradicts the fact that , for minimal surfaces,

y) = (t, 1) = (d(t), u2(t)) and 
the parallel transport vector field V(t) = (a(t), b(t)) = (wl(t), v2(t)). Then 
V(t) must be the solution to the following initial value problem 
(vl(O),v-yO)) = (0,l). 
Noticing the above expression of rik, along the curve, we see that the problem 
is equivalent to

Consider the hyperboloid S of one sheet x 2  + y2 - z2 = 4. 
(a) Define the Gauss curvature K of S. 
(b) Use the definition from part (a) to compute K at (0,2,0). 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
(a) The Gauss curvature K of S at P is defined by K = klk2, where kl, k2 
are the two principal curvatures of S at P. 
(b) At P = (0,2,0), in the direction of the circle of latitude, the normal 
section is a circle x 2  + y2 = 4. Thus, by taking the outer unit normal vector 
field as the orientation of S, the corresponding principal curvature Icl = -f; 

178 
whereas in the direction of the meridian, the normal section is a component of 
the hyperbola y2 - z2 = 4, thus the corresponding principal curvature k2 = i. 
Therefore, the Gauss curvature K = klk2 = -a.

Using the Descartes coordinates (x,y) in lR2, we can express the metric

What kind of a set could M 2  n {(z, y, t) : z = 0) be? 
Solution. 
i) The hypotheses imply that along the curve a ( s ) ,  the plane {(z,y,z) : 
z = 0) is a tangent plane of the surface M 2 .  Thus, the unit normal vector field 
n(s) of M 2  is constant along a(s). Therefore, along a(s), 
= 0, which 
means that the tangent vector of a ( s )  for every s is an asymptotic direction. 
Hence, a ( s )  is an asymptotic curve on M 2 .  
= -O-a'(s), from 
which the Rodriques equation says that a'(s) is always a principal direction 
with the principal curvature 0. 
iii) If we drop the assumption that M 2  n {(zl yl z )  : t = 0) is a curve, then 
the set M 2  n {(z,y,z) : z = 0) consists of elliptic or parabolic points of M 2 ,

Firstly, we claim that because of the compactness of M 2 ,  there must be a 
point P with K(P) > 0; hence, by the continuity, there exists a domain U of 
P such that KIu > 0. Secondly, we show that there exists another point Q 
with K(Q) < 0. Otherwise, we would have 
a contradiction. Finally, by the connectedness, the continuous function K must 
vanish somewhere on M 2 .

Consider the torus-of-revolution T obtained by rotating the circle ( z - u ) ~  +

Parameterize this torus, compute its Gauss curvature function K, and verify 
that sT KdA = 0 by explicit calculation. 
Solution. 
(Indiana) 
Thus obtained torus-of-revolution T can be parameterized by 
X(u,w) = ((u+rcosu)cosw,(a+rcosu)sinw,rsinu), 
0 < u,w < 27r. 
A straightforward computation gives the coefficients of its first and second

Consider the cone that is tangent to the unit sphere S2 along the curve

in polar coordinates by 0 < p < +m, 0 < 8 < AT. Because the parallel

By the Gauss-Bonnet formula, for any Riemannian metric on S2, we have

i) On the unit sphere, every great circle is a geodesic, because along a, 
the principal normal vector N is parallel to n. On the contrary, owing to the 
uniqueness of the initial value problem 
every geodesic on M ,  that starts from a given point and is tangent to a given 
direction, must be a great circle. 
ii) Since geodesics are intrinsic objects, then if we develop the cylinder to 
a plane, every geodesic must become a straight line. Therefore, every geodesic 
on the cylinder must be a helix, or a circle of latitude, or a straight generating 
line.

Give an example (e.g., draw a picture) to show that a connected surface

Solution. 
Let K be a plane and p, y two points in K. Let T be an interior point of the 
line segment py. Then the surface K\{T} is a case in point. “Completeness” is 
the usual topological hypothesis that prevents this problem.

Define “minimal surface in R3”,

Therefore, the principal curvatures of the graph

188 
ii) Let p(z0, yo, zo) be the “lowest” point on the surface. (The existence of 
such a point follows from the compactness of the surface.) Since the surface is 
above the plane T : z = zo and p is the common point of R and the surface, then 
T is the tangent plane of the surface at p .  By observing the normal section at 
p, it is easy to conclude that any normal curvature of the surface at p is greater 
than or equal to zero, if we take (O,O, 1) as the unit normal of the surface at 
p. Thus the Gauss curvature of the surface at p is not less than zero.

Let M be a 2-dimensional manifold smoothly embedded in lR3 with unit 
normal n. 
a) Prove that for each p E M there exist an open neighborhood Up of p in 
lR3 and a smooth function F : Up -+ B2 such that F-l(O) = Up n M .  
b) Find F if M is the graph of a smooth function f : lR2 + lR. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
Since the inclusion map M + lR3 is an embedding, for each coordinate 
neighborhood V c M of p E M ,  there exists a neighborhood U of p in R3, 
such that V = U 
M .  Using the local coordinates (u, v )  for V and (z, y, z )  
for U ,  we can express this embedding as ( u , ~ )  
-+ 
( z ( u , ~ ) , y ( u , v ) , z ( ~ , v ) ) .  
Noticing that 
we know from the implicit function theorem that there exists a neighborhood 
V, c V of p, such that on V,, 
2 = 2(u,v) 
{ Y = Y(U, 
{ 2) = v(2,y). 
has smooth inverse 
= 4 Z l Y )  
Then, we can find a neighborhood Up c U of p in lR3, such that V, = Up n M ,  
and in terms of the local coordinates (z,y), the embedding can be expressed 
by (2, Y) - (z, Y, f(2, Y)), where f(z, Y) = z(u(2, Y>, 
~ ( 2 ,  
Y)). 
Therefore, setting F : Up ---t R3 by F(z,y,z) = z - f(z,y), we have 
F - ~ ( o )  
= up n M .  

1 89 
b) If M is the graph of a smooth function f : R2 -+ lR, then for each p E M ,  
we can take Up = R3, and F : R3 
-+ R defined by F(z,y,z) = z - f(z,y).

Let M be a 2-dimensional manifold smoothly embedded in R3 with unit 
normal n. Assume that M is the boundary of a bounded convex open set. 
Assume that n is the exterior normal and that the Gauss curvature K of M 
is everywhere positive. [Recall that S C R3 is defined to be convex if for each 
two points of S the line segment joining these points lies in S. You may use 
without proof the fact that M lies on one side of each of its tangent planes.] 
a) Define the Gauss (or sphere) map

b) and c). We first prove that q : M .+ S2 is a local diffeomorphism. 
For each p E M ,  there exist a coordinate neighborhood C c M of p and a 
coordinate map h : C -+ U c B2, which is a diffeomorphism, such that on U 
the Gauss map has the following expression 
(Indiana) 
q 0 h-'(u, .>

where n(u, v) is the unit normal at X ( u ,  v) E C C M .

Since nu x n,, = K X ,  x Xu and K > 0, Xu x Xu # 0, the rank of the

190 
Thus, the implicit function theorem says that 7 o h-l has a smooth inverse on 
a neighborhood of h(p) (which may be smaller than U ) ;  hence 7oh-l is a local 
diffeomorphism. Therefore, in the neighborhood of h(p), q = (7 o h-') o h is a 
diffeomorphism. Thus, on M ,  7 is a local diffeomorphism. 
Next, we show that q : M -+ S2 is surjective. Since 7 : M -+ S2 is a local 
diffeomorphism, q is an open map. Besides, because M is compact and S2 is 
a Hausdorff space, 7 is also a closed map. Thus q ( M )  is an open, closed and 
non-empty set of S 2 .  The connectedness of S2 implies that q ( M )  = S2. 
Now we prove that q : M 
----t S2 is globally one-to-one by leading to a 
contradiction. Suppose that there are two distinct points P, Q E M such that 
q ( P )  = q(Q). From the above argument we know that there are neighborhoods 
C p ,  CQ of P,Q respectively, such that 7Ic, 
: C p  - 7(Cp),qlc, : CQ -+ 
~ ( C Q )  
are diffeomorphisrns. Because P # Q, in M we can choose C ~ , C Q  
so 
small that C p  n CQ = 0. Now take the inverse images of ~ ( C P )  
nq(CQ) under 
q l ~ ,  
and qlcQ, respectively. Namely, set 
u = (vIcp)-1(7(CP) n 7(CQ)), 
v = (vIc*)-'(7(cP) " rl(CQ))- 
Thus, unv = 0 and q ( U )  = q(V), which implies q(M\U) = S2. On the other 
hand, it is easy to show that M is compact, connected and oriented. Then the 
Gauss-Bonnet formula gives 
Kda = 4n, (by noting K > 0), 
1, da = I, 
where da, fi have local expressions 
Hence 
Since 5, Kda > 0, we arrive at a contradiction. 
In the end, noticing that differentiability is a local property, we see that 
the globally one-to-one, surjective local diffeomorphism is naturally a global 
diffeomorphism. 

191 
Remark. In fact, this problem is the famous Hadamard theorem. Using 
Firstly, as the above, show that q : M --t S2 is a local diffeomorphism. 
Since M is compact and S2 is connected, then the local diffeomorphism 
q : M -+ S2 is also a covering map. 
Further, because S2 is simply connected, and M c R3 is connected and 
hence path connected, we know that the covering map q must be a homeomor- 
phism and hence a global diffeomorphism.

(Indiana) 
Solution. 
a) The terminology “intrinsic quantities” means those geometrical quanti- 
ties that are definable only by the first fundamental form of M and its deriva- 
tives. Otherwise, they are called “extrinsic quantities”. In other words, intrin- 
sic quantities are those that are invariant under isometric correspondence, but 
extrinsic ones are not. 
b) The principal curvatures axe not intrinsic; they are extrinsic. For exam- 
ple, consider a plane and a cylinder. 
c) Although the covariant derivative on M is defined by using the covariant 
derivative on R3, 
the last local expression of the covariant derivative of M 
involves the tangent vector field and the Christoffel symbols of M .  Therefore, 
it is intrinsic. 
d) For each p E M ,  let C be a simple closed curve encircling a simply 
connected domain D where p lies. Let Aw denote the angle variance caused by 
a tangent vector after parallel translating it around C once. Using the Hopf’s

Gauss curvature of M at p can be expressed by

Solution. 
The surface M 2  of revolution generated by the curve y is homeomorphic 
to a section of a cylindrical surface. Thus the Euler characteristic number 
x ( M 2 )  = 0. Besides, the boundary of M 2  consists of two circles which are just 
geodesics of M 2 ,  because along these circles the normal vector of M 2  is parallel 
to the principal normal vector of the two circles respectively. Therefore, by 
the famous Gauss-Bonnet formula, we have immediately 
KdA = 0.

A surface C2 immersed in a Riemannian manifold N is said to be ruled if

b) Show it for arbitrary n.

SECTION 3 
DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY OF MANIFOLD 
3301 
Let M" be a Riemannian manifold and R a 2-plane in T, M. 
i) Let { X , Y }  be an orthonormal basis of R. Use this basis to define the 
sectional curvature K ( R )  and show that it depends only on R and not the 
particular basis chosen. 
ii) Define the Riemann curvature tensor in terms of covariant differentia- 
tion. Explain why it is a tensor. 
iii) Recall that if M" c En+' is a hypersurface, then 
R ( X ,  Y ) Z  = (LY, Z ) L X  - ( L X ,  Z)LY, 
where L is the Weingarten map. Using this or any other valid method, compute 
all sectional curvatures of the sphere {z E B4 
: 121 = 3). 
Solution. 
i) The sectional curvature is defined by K ( R )  = - R ( X , Y , X , Y ) ,  where 
R( ) is the Riemannian curvature tensor field of M". If ( 2 , Y )  is another 
orthonormal basis of R ,  then 2 = aX + by, ? = cX + d Y .  Noticing that 
( 1 ) is an orthogonal matrix, and R( ) is a 4th order covariant tensor 
field, we can easily have R ( X ,  Y ,  X ,  Y )  = R ( X ,  Y, X ,  Y ) ,  which proves that 
K ( R )  depends only on R. 
ii) For any vector fields X ,  Y, 2, W on M", define the Riemannian curvature 
operator by R(X, Y)Z = VxVyZ - VyVxZ - V[X,Y]Z and the Riemannian 
curvature tensor field by R ( X ,  Y, 2, W )  = ( R ( X ,  Y ) Z ,  W ) ,  respectively. Then 
for any C" function f on M", using the properties of covariant differentiation 
and of the inner product, we can conclude from straighforward computation 
that 
(Indiana) 
- - - -  
R(fX, y, z, 
W )  = R ( X ,  fY, z, 
W )  = R ( X ,  y, fZ, W )  
R ( X , Y , Z ,  fW) = f R ( X , Y , Z ,  W). 
= 
Thus, in terms of local coordinate frame field, one can show that V p  E M", 
R(X, Y, 
2, W)I, is dependent only on X,, Y,, Z,, W, E T'(M"). Therefore, 

195 
R( ) I p  is a well-defined 4th order multilinear function. Besides, the inner 
product and covariant differentiation are all C". 
Hence, R( ) thus defined is 
a C" tensor field. 
iii) For the sphere M n  = {z E lR4,1zl = 3}, we can regard the position 
vector field 2 as the normal vector field of Mn. 
Let { e i }  be a local orthonormal 
frame field about 3: (as a point) of Mn. 
Then by the original definition of 
covariant differentiation, one can easily show that Veiz = ei, where V denotes 
the covariant differentiation in lR4. Hence, the Weingarten map is L : X F-+ 
L ( X )  = -Vxg = -X/3. Therefore, if { X , Y }  is any orthonormal basis of an 
arbitrary 2-plane T in Tp(Mn),

Let C = {z E lR3 : 0 5 3ci 5 1) be the unit cube in B3. Suppose

therefore has a volume. Justify the following formula:

Let Au be the volume of the parallelopiped spanned by the vectors PzP;, P3Pl

Hence the desired formula follows immediately.

along N ,  using the Cm(M x N)-linearity of the curvature operator, we have 
R ( X ,  Y,

Therefore, the sectional curvature determined by X and Y always vanishes. 
Obviously, here X may involve yp, and Y may involve 2,.

the interior product of a vector field with a form, for example, if R is a pform, 
then Y [R is a ( p  - 1)-form defined by

It is easy to see that f I-, is also a C” function, and by the invariance of the

a) As known, thus defined mapping V is the Riemannian connection. Using 
the properties of V ,  we can prove that V%Y is completely determined by a(t)

dF = (All, A12, A13, A21,A22, A23, A31, A32, A33) where Aij is the algebraic 
complement of the corresponding entry aij of A, we see that rankdF = 1

explain how M can be identified with the unit tangent bundle of 5''. 
(Indiana) 
Solution. 
i) Identify lR6 with {(x, y) : x, y E lR3} and define a map F : R6 
-+ 
IR3 by 
F ( x ,  Y) = (fl, f2, f3) = (11x112, llY1I2, (x, 
Y)). 
It is easy to verify that the Jacobi matrix of the C" map F 

212 
has constant rank three when fl = 11z1(2 = 1, f2 = ( ( ~ ( 1 ~  
= 1 and f3 = (z,y) = 
0. Therefore, F-’(l, 1,O) = M is a closed embedded submanifold of B6. 
Besides, since II(z,y)II = (llzllz + Ilyl12)i = fi which means M is bounded in 
IR6, M must be compact. 
Naturally, for every (z,y) 
E M ,  if we regard z E S2 and y E T,(S2) with 
1)yI) = 1, then we can identify M with the unit tangent bundle of S2. 
ii) Because S2 is orientable, S2 has a covering {(U,,#J~)} of coherently 
oriented coordinate neighborhoods. By using identification of M with the 
unit tangent bundle of S2, for every (z, y) E M ,  z has the local coordinates 
(ui,ui) 
E U,, and y is uniquely determined by the oriented angle 0, at z 
from 4 to the unit tangent vector y E T,(S2). Thus, (U, x I,,& 
x $,) 
is 
a coordinate neighborhood of (2, 
y) E M ,  where I, = (0, - E ,  0, + E )  with E 
being a suitable positive real number and 4, is the map from (2, y) to 0,. 
If (U, x I,, 4, 
x 4,) n (Up x I p ,  #Jp x $ p )  # 0, then the transition function 
has the following J acobian 
au, 
which means that {(Va x I,,dol x 4,)) form a covering of coherently oriented 
neighborhoods. Hence, M is orientable. 
3322 
Let F : M 4 N be a local isometry between connected Riemannian mani- 
folds M and N .  Show that if M is complete, so is N and F is a covering 
map. 
Solution. 
Because F is a local isometry, F ( M )  is open in N .  If y is a limit point of 
F ( M )  in N ,  then there is a point z E M such that there exists a geodesic in 
N connecting F ( z )  and y. The local isometry of F and the completeness of M 
imply that the above geodesic can be uniquely lifted to a geodesic in M starting 
from z, and the image of its end point under F must be y. Therefore, F ( M )  is 
also closed in N .  Thus, the connectedness of N implies that F ( M )  = N ,  i.e., 
F is surjective. Besides, since F maps every geodesic of M into a geodesic of 
N ,  the Hopf-finow theorem means that N is complete, too. 
Next, we show that F is a covering map. For every x’ E N ,  take S > 0 
so small that exp,, : B’(S) -+ Bi is a diffeomorphism, where B’(6) = {v E 
(Indiana) 

21 3 
T,f(N) : IvI < S} and Bi = {y’ E N : d(y’,z’) < 5). Since F is a local 
isometry, F-l(z’) is discrete. Denote F-l(z’) = {z,} 
c M and set Ba(S) = 
{v E T,-((M) 
: lvl < 6) and Br = {y E M : d(y,za) < a}. Then, we claim 
that Bi is an admissible neighborhood of z’ and F is a covering map. 
Firstly, we claim that F-l(Bi) = UB?. In fact, if z E F-’(B;), then 
there is a unique geodesic y : [0,1] -+ B; such that y(0) = F ( z )  and y(1) = 2’. 
Since F is a local isometry, there exists a geodesic y : [0,1] -+ M such that 
F(T(t)) = y(t), Vt. Hence F(y(1)) = z’ and y(1) = z, 
for some a. Besides, 
L(y) = L(y) < S means that z = T(0) E Br, i.e., F-l(B;) c U B r .  On the 
other hand, u Br c F-l(B;) is obvious. Thus the claim is proved. 
0 
a 
0 
Secondly, we say that for any a, F : B,O -+ Bi is a diffeomorphism. Since 
M is complete, we have the following commutative diagram 
and expZe is surjective. Besides, we know that d F ,  exp,, are diffeomorphisms. 
Therefore, F o expZm = expzf odF is a diffeomorphism and hence exp,, 
is 
an immersion. So, expXm is also a diffeomorphism. Hence F = exp,, odF o 
(exp,.)-’ is a diffeomorphism. 
Thirdly, we claim that if Q # ,8, then BF n Bf = 8. Otherwise, if there 
is z E B,” n B f ,  then there exist unique geodesics y,, yp connecting z with 
z,, 
zp respectively. Let y be the unique geodesic in Bi connecting F ( z )  and 
2’. Because both F : B,“ -+ B; and F : B6p 
-+ B; are isometric, we have 
F(y,) = y = F(yp). In other words, ya,yp are the lifts of y through z. The 
uniqueness implies ya = yp. In particular, z, 
= ya(l) = yp(1) = zcp, which 
contradicts a # p. 
Let F : M -+ M be an isometry of a Riemannian manifold M .  
i) Show that each component of X = {z E M : F ( z )  = z} is an embedded 
totally geodesic submanifold of M .  

214 
Hint. Use exponential coordinates. 
ii) Give an example in which the components of X have different dimen- 
sions. 
Solution. 
i) First, we show that X has submanifold structures. For z E X c M ,  
set B(6) = {v E T,(M) : IvI < 6) and Ba = {y E M : d(z,y) < 6}, where 
6 is so small that exp, : B(6) -+ Bg is a diffeomorphism. Define V = {v E 
T,(M) : dF(v) = v}. Thus, V is a subspace of T,(M). Then we claim that 
XnBa = exp,(VnB(6)). If this is proved, because exp,(VnB(G)) is obviously 
a submanifold of M ,  we can assert that X has submanifold structures. In 
order to prove the claim, we first assume that y = X n & and v E B(6) 
such that exp,v = y. Let y : [0,1] 4 M be the unique shortest geodesic 
y(t) = exp,(tv) connecting z and y. Since z,y E X ,  and F is an isometry, 
F ( y )  is also a shortest geodesic connecting F ( z )  = z and F(y) = y. Thus 
the uniqueness implies F ( y )  = y. In particular, d F ( j ( 0 ) )  = j(O), namely, 
d F ( v )  = v. Therefore, v E V which means that y E exp,(V n B(6)), i.e., 
X n Bg c exp,(V n B(6)). On the other hand, suppose that v E V n B(6) and 
y = exp, v. Let the geodesic y : [0,1] 4 
M be defined by y(t) = exp,(tv). 
From dF(v) = v follows dF(T(0)) = j ( 0 ) .  Then, that F is an isometry implies 
F(y) = y. In particular, F(y) = F(y(1)) = y(1) = y, which means that 
y E X n Bg, 
i.e., exp,(V n B(6)) c X n Ba. 
Next, we show that every geodesic y : (a,b) -+ X parameterized by ar- 
clength is also a geodesic of M .  For any SO E (a, b), let <(s) be a geodesic 
of M such that <(so) =  SO), i(so) = ?(SO). 
Since F(<(so)) = (‘(SO), 
dF(((s0)) = ((so) and F is an isometry, then F(<) and < are two geodesics of 
M which satisfy the same initial conditions. Therefore, F(<) = <, i.e., < lies 
in X .  Besides, < is naturally a geodesic of X. Thus, in a neighborhood of SO, 
< = y. Because so is arbitrarily chosen. y is a geodesic of M .  Hence, X is 
totally geodesic.

i) For every p E M ,  take a local coordinate neighborhood about p such 
that the coordinate curves are the integral curves of X and their orthogonal 
trajectories. Namely, we may assume that X = X I &  and g12 = (&, &) = 
0. Because the flow X t  of X for every t is an isometry, the vector field X 
should satisfy the Killing equation Xi,j + Xj,i = 0; i, j = 1,2, or equivalently,

Taking i = 1, j = 2, we obtain 911%

Then, using the Liouville formula, we can compute the geodesic curvature of 
the xl-coordinate curve as follows: 
ak 
where 0 = 0. Therefore, along every integral curve of X, = 0, i.e., Ic, = 
const. 
ii) Analogously, about p ,  take the integral curves of X and Y as the x1 
and x2 coordinate curves, respectively. Then, we have locally X = X I & ,  
Y = Y2&. 
Because their flows are commutative Xt o Y, = Y, o X t ,  that is

element of G. Noting that g(t) is a geodesic of G and Xg(tl = y, 
we have 
obviously 
vx,x = -

Besides, because the metric of G is bi-invariant, we know that V x X  = 0 is 
valid everywhere. Especially, if X = ei + e j ,  then V e i + e j ( e i  + e j )  = 0 implies 
that 
Veiej + Veje, = 0. 
On the other hand, the Levi-Civita connection V satisfies

Thus, we obtain

Show that E is not measurable. 
Solution. 
S1 is an abelian group under the binary operation ([z], [y]) H 
[z + y] and 
the inverse operation. [z] +-+ [-.I. 
For any [z] E S1 
there is by the construction of E a unique element [y] E E 
such that z - y E &. Then [z] = [y] + [r], where T E [0,1) n& is such that 
r G z - y modZ. So we conclude that S1 =

If T ,  s E [0,1) n& are such that ( E  + [TI) n ( E  + [s]) # 0 there are [z], [y] E E 
such that [z] + [T] = [y] + [s]. It follows that z 
y mod& and therefore 
[z] = [y] by the construction of E. Thus [r] = [s], which then implies that 
T = s since -1 < r - s < 1. 
It follows that { E  + [TI 1 T E [0, 1) n&} is a partition of S1. 
Let m denote the natural Lebesgue measure on S1 such that m(S1) = 1.

If there is a to E (O,p(S)) not in the range of p. Let 
P = { A  I A measurable and p(A) < t o } /  -, 
where - is an equivalence relation: A - B if p(A\B) = p(B\A) = 0. Then P

It follows that [A] is an upper bound of Q in P. There is by Zorn’s Lemma

B C S\Ao and p ( B )  > 0. (e.g. p(S\A) > t o  - p(A0)). Let

then cr 2 to-p(A) and there is a decreasing sequence { [Eln]} of S with {p(B,)}

So p ( B )  = a > 0. Therefore p ( B )  > to - p(A0). [B] E R. For any [Cl E S, if

It follows that [B] is a lower bound of S in R. There is by Zorn’s Lemma a 
minimal element [Bo] of R. However, by the assumption that there is a subset

a B E 0 and an M E X such that K C B and p(B\K) < E and such that 
M C B\L and p(B\L) < p ( M )  + E. Then we have 
V). 
K\L c B\L, 
P(B\L) < P(K\L) + E ;  
K n M C K\L, 
p(K\L) < p ( K  M )  + E. 
Thus K\L is regular. 
Step 2. If {E; I 1 5 i 5 n} is a finite class of mutually disjoint, regular

For any E > 0, there are B1,. . . , B, E 0 such that Ei C Bi with

Consequently,

which shows the outer regularity of u Ei. The inner regularity follows from 
the following inequalities 
Step 3. If {En I n E IN} is an increasing sequence of regular sets then 
03 (J En is regular. 
n = l  
00 
Let E = u En. Obviously 
n = l  
p(E) I inf{p(V) I E G V E O}. 
For any E > 0 there are V1,. . , V,, . . . E 0 such that En C Vn and p(Vn) < 
03 
p(En) + &. Let V = U Vn E 0, then 
n= 1 
which shows the outer regularity of E ,  while the inner regularity follows from 
the following inequalities 
co 
Step 4. If {En} is a decreasing sequence of regular sets, then n En is

regular.

Let E = n En. For any E > 0, n E lN, there is a K, E ?E such that

What are the dimensions of the vector spaces L1(p), Lz(p), and L"O(p)? Jus-

Solution. 
We have dimL1(p) = dimL2(p) = 1 and dimLW(p) = 2. Since each func-

at b coincide in L1(p) or L2(p), we conclude that dimL'(p) = dimL2(p) = 1.

If {fn I R. E nV} span a dense subspace of L2(0, l), then {fn} is an orthonomal

is a dense subspace of L2(0, 1) while

(c) True. If neither of f and g is identically zero in R, then both f and g 
have at most countably many zeros in R, and the zeros have no limit point in 
R. Then f(z) . g(z) is not identically zero in R. 
(d) False. A counterexample is f(z) = e", which is analytic in R, and 
continuous on a with If(iy)I E 1. But f(z) is not bounded in R.

for 0 5 z 5 1 and

for 0 I y 5 1, by comparing the real and imaginary parts in the above identity, 
we obtain that f(z+i) = f(z) for 0 5 z 5 1 and f(l+yi) = f(yi) for 0 5 y _< 1. 
Hence f ( z )  can be analytically extended to a double-periodic function by 
f(z) = f ( z  + 1) = f(z + i), 
which is holomorphic in a‘ and satisfies

Let f be continuous on the closure 3 of the unit square 
s = { z  = z + i y E @ ’ :  0 < 2 < l , o  < y < l}, 
and let f be analytic on S. If Rf = 0 on sn ({y = O }  U {y = l)), and if If = 0 
on Sn ({z = 0) U (2 = l}), prove that f = 0 everywhere on S. 
Solution. 
Define F ( z )  = si f(z)dz, where the integral is taken along any curve in 
which has endpoints 0 and z. Then F ( z )  is analytic in S and continuous on 
S. For z E as, we choose the integral path on dS and consider the differential 
form f(z)dz in the integral. Let f = u + i w ,  then 
(Indiana) 
- 
f(z)dz = (udz - vdy) + i(wdz + udy). 
On 3n ({y = 0) U {y = 1)) we have u = 0 and dy = 0, and on sn ({z = 
0) u {z = 1)) we have v = 0 and dz = 0. Hence we obtain Re(f(z)dz) = 0 on 
dS which implies ReF(z) = 0 when z E dS. 
Let G ( z )  = eF(*). Then G(z) is analytic in S and IG(z)I = 1 when z E 85’. 
Because G(z) has no zeros in S, so l/G(z) is also analytic in S and 11/G(z)l = 1 
when z E dS. Apply the maximum modulus principle to both G ( z )  and 
l/G(z), we obtain IG(z)I 
1 for z E S, which implies that G ( z )  is a constant 
of modulus 1. It follows from G(z) = eF(’) that F ( z )  is also a constant. Hence 
f(z) = F’(z) G 0.

(c) Identify on a picture any points z where T ( z )  converges but T ( z )  #

are no such points, is this something special to this example, or a general 
impossibility? Explain and/or give examples. 
(Minnesota) 
Solution. 
(a) When z is in the neighborhood of zo = -4 + 3i, we have 
f(z) = logz = l0g[(-4 + 3i) + (Z + 4 - 3i)]

Hence the Taylor polynomial of f of degree 2 at -4 + 3i is 
co + c1(z + 4 - 3i) + cg(z + 4 - 3 4 2 ,

(b) Denote the Taylor series of f(z) at -4 + 3i by T ( z ) .  Because log z has 
only z = 0 and z = 00 as its branch points, and has no other singular point, the 
radius of convergence R of T ( z )  is equal to the distance between z = -4 + 3i 
and z = 0. Hence R = 5. 
(c) Denote the shaded domain shown in Fig.5.1 by a. When z E Cl = 
{ z  : Iz + 4 - 3i( < 5,Imz < 0 } ,  T ( z )  # f(z). It is because T ( z )  in R is the 
continuation of logz at -4 + 3i in the disk { z  : Iz + 4 - 3il < 5}, while f(z) 
in R is the continuation of log z at -4 + 3i in the slit plane @\(-m, 01. Hence

the difference is 2ai, i.e., T(z) = f(z) + 27ri.

Let f be the analytic function defined in the disk A = { z  : Iz - 41 < 4) so 
that f ( z )  = z i ( z  + 1)i in A and f(z) is positive for 0 < 2 < 8. An analytic 
function g in A is obtained from f by analytic continuation along the path 
starting and ending at z = 4 (see Fig.5.2). Express g in terms of f .

which implies that z = 0 is a removable singular point of f(z). It is obvious 
that z = n2R2 (n = 1 , 2 , .  . .) are poles of f(z). Hence f(z) is single-valued and 
analytic inC\{z = n2r2 : n = 1 , 2 , . . . }  .

(Indiana-Purdue) 
Solution. 
Let I? be an arbitrary simple closed curve in a, and denote by A,r#J(z) the 
change of r#J(z) when z goes continuously along I' counterclockwise once. It is 
known that f and g can be represented by

we have Arf(z) = 0 and Apg(z) = 0. Hence both f(z) and g ( z )  have single- 
valued branches which are holomorphic in Q, and each of f and g has two 
single-valued branches. 
In order to know which of f and g has a single-valued primitive in R, we 
consider the integrals 1, f(z)dz and 1, g(z)dz. If the segment (-1 5 z 5 
1, y = 0) is not inside I?, it is obvious that s, 
f (z)dz = 0 and Sr g(z)dz = 0. 
If the segment (-1 5 z 5 1,y = 0) is inside I?, we consider the Laurent 
expansion of f and g about z = 03:

It follows that sr f(z)dz = 0 and lrg(z)dz = f 2 a .  Hence we obtain that 
both of the single-valued branches of f are the derivatives of single-valued 
holomorphic functions in Q, and the primitives are szt f(z)dz + c, where the 
integral is taken along any curve connecting zo and z in 0. But neither of the 
branches of g is the derivative of a single-valued holomorphic function in a.

(a) Let D c C be the complement of the simply connected closed set

loge = 1. Find log el5. Justify your answer.

integration to an appropriate covering space, give a precise meaning to the

Solution. 
(a) The set {ee+ie I 6 E IR} U (0) is a spiral which intersects the positive 
real axis at {e2nn : n = 0,*1,*2,. 
. a ) .  
The single-valued branch of logz is 
defined by loge = 1. Hence loge15 = loge + Arlogz, where I' is a continuous 
curve connecting z = e and z = el5 in D and A r  log z is the change of log z 
when z goes continuously along r from z = e to z = el5. It follows that 
Arlogz = Aplog IzI + iArargz, and Arlog IzI = 15 - 1 = 14. Because 
e E (e', e2=), el5 E (e4A, e6=), we know that when I' connects e and el5 in D, 
Arargz must be 4a. Hence log el5 = 1 + (14 + 4ai) = 15 + 4ai. 
(b) Define the lift mapping by w = logz which lifts the unit circle y one-to- 
one onto a segment with length 2ir on the imaginary axis of w-plane. Because 
(HUT7NZrd)

both the starting point of y and the single-valued branch of log z on y can be 
arbitrarily chosen, the segment on w-plane can be denoted by [it,i(t + 27r)), 
where t can be any real number. Hence we have

Find the most general harmonic function of the form f(lzI), z E C\O. 
Which 
of these f(I.1) 
have a single valued harmonic conjugate? 
Solution. 
Because f(I.1)

(with real variable t )  has continuous derivatives f’(t) and f”(t). Note that the

where t = IzI. This differential equation is easy to solve, and the solution is 
f ( t )  = Q log t + 0, 
where (Y,P are two real constants. Hence the most general 
harmonic function of the form f( 1.1) 
in C\O is Q log IzI + 0. 
Since log IzI has no single-valued harmonic conjugate inC\O, we know that 
when f( 1.1) 
has a single-valued harmonic conjugate in C\O, it must be a con- 
stant.

Consider the regular pentagram centered at the origin in the complex plane.

Suppose G is a region in C, [0,1] c G, and h : G + lR is continuous. 
hl,qpl] is harmonic, does this implies that h is harmonic on G? 
Solution.

The answer is No. 
A counterexample is h(z) = Red-, 
where the single-valued branch 
of d

is chosen by d m l z = z  
= 4. Since d

Hence h(z) = 0 when z = 2, 0 5 2 5 1, and h ( z )  is continuous onC. But h(z) 
is not harmonic on&, because z = 0 and z = 1 are branch points of d m .  
Remark. If the problem is changed to h : G -+ C is continuous and 
hl~\[o,l] is holomorphic, then h must be holomorphic on G.

Let 7 be an arc of the unit circle. Suppose that u and v are harmonic in 
D = { z  : IzI < 1) and continuously differentiable on D u y. If the boundary 
values satisfy u = v on y and the radial derivatives satisfy

that u = v in D. 
Solution. 
Let u* be a conjugate harmonic function of u in D and v* be a conjugate 
harmonic function of v in D. We know that a variation of Cauchy-Riemann 
equations for f = u + iu* and g = v + iv* are

It follows from the continuous differentiability of u and v on D U y that u* 
and v* can be continuously extended to D U y and then are also continuously 
differentiable on D U y. Let zo be a fixed point on y, and for z E y denote 
the subarc of y from zo to z by yz. Without loss of generality, we may assume 
that u*(zo) = v*(zo) = 0. Then for z E y, 
= lz 
:dB 
= v*(z). 
Hence we obtain two functions f = u + iu* and g = v + iv* which are analytic 
in D and continuous on D Uy, such that f = g on y. Let F = f - g. Then by 
the reflection principle, F can be analytically extended to an analytic function 
on D u y U D*, where D* = {z : IzI > 1). Since F = 0 on y, we obtain F 
0 
on D U y U D*, which implies u = v in D.

It is easy to know that w = -is 
is a conformal mapping of the unit 
disc D = { z  : IzI < 1) onto the upper half plane H = {w : Imw > 0). The 
boundary correspondence is that the negative real axis {w : --oo < w < 0) 
corresponds to the arc I’l = { z  = eie : 0 < 8 < T) and the positive real axis 
{w : 0 < w < +a} 
corresponds to the arc rz = { z  = eie : T < d < 2 ~ } .

Let +(z) = $3 o $2 o #q(z), then @ maps { z  : IzJ < l} conformally onto D 1  
with @(O) = 0, W(0) > 0. After considering the boundary correspondence, we 
know that 1, corresponds to the arc { z  = eit : It( < E }  under the map @. Since 
the symmetric domain of (1.1 
< 1) with respect to arc { z  = eit : It( < E }  is 
(1.1 
> l}, and the symmetric domain of D1 with respect to I, is D2 = (111 < 
l}\n1, by the reflection principle, @(z) can be extended to a conformal map 
of fie onto {C : ICI < 1). Hence the conformal map f in the problem is nothing 
but the inverse of @, and the domain f maps onto (1.1

bounded by circular arcs I, and {C = eie : (01 5 i}.

T is uniquely determined by G and a.

Since f is a conformal map of D onto itself, it can be written as f ( z )  = s,

It follows from f o f = id that b(a + d) = c(a + d) = 0 and a2 + bc = 
d2 + bc # 0. 
If a + d  # 0, then b = c = 0. Hence ad-bc > 0 and a2+bc = d2+bcimpies 
f = id, which contradicts the condition f # id. Thus we have a + d = 0 and 
the inequality ad - bc > 0 can be written as bc + a2 < 0.

cz2 + (d - a)z - b = 0. Since A = (d - a)2 + 4bc is equal to 4bc + 4a2 < 0, we

Since f maps aD into all, we know that %(ei6) = 0. If g ( e i e )  1 0 ,  then 
at point ei6, 
= 2 
= 2 = 0, which implies that g(ei6) = f'(ei0) = 
0. But from (a) it is impossible. If g ( e i e )  < 0 ,  it follows from 7-s = Rg 
aR i6 
that %(e ) < 0. Since R = 1 when r = 1, g ( e i 6 )  < 0 implies that R > 1 
when r < 1. This is also impossible. Hence we obtain 
= 
(c) Because f l a ~  
is a tweto-one map from 8 0  onto aD, &Alzl=largf(z) = 
2, which implies that f(z) has two zeros (counted by multiplicity) in D. Since 
f(0) = f'(0) = 0, z = 0 is a zero of f of multiplicity m = 2. Hence f(z) has 
no zero in (0 < It1 < I}.

Let f be holomorphic in the unit disk (1.1

5 1) 
and If(.)/ 
= 1 whenever (zJ = 1. Prove that f is a rational function. 
(SUNY, Stony Brook) 

414 
Solution. 
If f(z) has infinite many zeros, by the isolatedness of the zeros of holomor- 
phic functions, the zeros must have limit points on the boundary of the unit 
disk. But it will violate the fact that f is continuous in ( 1 . ~ 1  5 1) and If(.)/ 
= 1 
whenever IzI = 1. Hence f has only finite zeros in the unit disk. Denote all 
these zeros by zlr 22,. . . , z,, multiple zeros being repeated, and define 
Then F ( z )  is holomorphic in (1.1 
< 1). continuous in (1.1 
5 1) and IF(z)I = 1 
when IzJ = 1. By the maximum modulus principle, IF(z)I 5 1 in (1.1 
5 1). 
Since F ( z )  has no zero in (IzI 5 1) -L- is also holomorphic in (1.1 
< l}, 
F ( z )  
continuous in ( 1 . ~ 1  5 1) and I&JI 
= 1 when IzI = 1. Application of the 
maximum modulus principle to & yields IF(z)I 2 1 in (1.1 
5 1). Hence 
IF(z)I = 1 holds in ( 1 . ~ 1  5 l}, which implies F ( z )  = eia with Q: a real number. 
So we obtain 
5403 
Let f be a continuous function on v = { z  : IzI 5 1) such that f is analytic 
in U. If f = 1 on the half-circle y = (eie : 0 5 8 5 a}, prove that f = 1 
everywhere in v. 
Solution. 
Define F ( z )  = (f(z) - l)(f(-z) - l), then F ( z )  is also continuous on V and 
analytic in U. When z E dU, we have either f(z) - 1 = 0 or f(-z) - 1 = 0. 
Hence F ( z )  = 0 holds for all z E v, 
which implies either f(z) - 1 
0 or 
f(-z) - 1 
0, we obtain 
f ( z )  
Remark. The condition that “f = 1 on the half-circle y” can be weakened 
to that “f = 1 on an arc y = (eie : 0 5 8 5 f}, where n is a natural number”. 
In this case, the proof is the same except that F(z) is defined by

prove that

(Indiana) 
Solution. 
Because f is a one-to-one conformal map of@\K onto A with f(w) = 0, 
it has a simple zero at z = 00. Since p is a polynomial of degree n, it has a 
pole of order n at z = M. Hence the function F ( z )  = p(z)fn(z) is analytic in 
G\K 
which contains point z = 00. As f(z) maps@\K onto A = { z  : IzJ < l}, 
we have lim lf(z)J = 1. Together with Ip(z)I 5 1 for z E K, we know that the 
limit of IF(.)\ when z tends to K can not be larger than 1. Apply the maximum 
modulus principle to F ( z )  on@\K, we obtain IF(z)I 5 1 for z EG\K, which 
implies Ip(z)I 5 If(z)I-" for all z E@\K.

must be the constant c. 
Without loss of generality, we assume that f is not a constant, and try to 
lead to a contradiction. Since the image of an open set { z  : Iz - 201 < 6) c G 
under f is an open set which contains point f(zo), f(z) assumes all the values 
f(z) = f(z0) + &ei+ for small E > 0 and 0 5 4 < 27r in { z  : Iz - z0I < 6). Then

which implies that g(z) must be a polynomial of degree 1. Hence we have 
sin z - z = ear+bp(z). 
Let z = z+iy and z be fixed. By letting y + +oo and y -+ -oo respectively, 
and comparing the increasing order on both sides, we obtain that Imu < 0 in 
the former case and that Imu > 0 in the latter case. This contradiction implies 
that sin z = z has infinite many solutions in C.

(a) Let f be a non-constant analytic function in the annulus (1 < IzI < 2) 
and suppose that If I = 5 on the boundary. Show that f has at least two zeros. 
(b) I f f  is meromorphic in the annulus, is the statement in part (a) still 
true? 
Solution. 
(a) Let D = { z  : 1 < It1 < 2) and dD = rl U r2, where rl = { z  : IzI = 2) 
is in the counterclockwise sense, and I'2 = { z  : IzI = 1) is in the clockwise 
sense. Because f is non-constant analytic in D and I f 1  = 5 when z E dD, 
we 
know that both f(I'1) and f(rz) 
must be {w : lwl = 5) in the counterclockwise 
sense. Hence &Ap,argf(z) 2 1 and &Ar,argf(z) 2 1. In other words, 
(Stanfod) 
which shows by the argument principle that f has at least two zeros in D. 
(b) If f is meromorphic in D, the statement in (a) is not true. It might 
occur that f(rl) and f(r2) are two subarcs of {w : IwI = 5), or both f(r1) 
and f(r2) are {w : IwI = 5) in the clockwise sense. In the latter case, f has no 
zero in D. The following is a counterexample. Let g(C) be a conformal map of 
{ ( = < + i r l : $ + $ < l ,  

427 
onto {w : IwI > 5) with the normalization g(0) = M, g'(0) > 0. Then 
is a non-constant meromorphic function in D with If I = 5 when t E LID. But 
f has no zero in D.

When n is sufficiently large,

for ICI = :, which implies the numbers of zeros for F(C) and eC in {/(I < :} 
are equal. Since ec has no zero in a', we obtain 
for fixed T and large n. 
(c) From the above discussion, we conclude that for any fixed T > 0, when 
n is sufficiently large, there is no zero of f ( z )  in { IzI > T } .  In other words, all 
the n zeros of f ( z )  are in { IzI 5 T } .

Since f is analytic in R and bounded by lf(z)I < 1, the points z = =kf

7 2  are not homologous to zero (mod R), f * yl and 
f *y2 are also not homologous to zero (mod R). As E tends to zero, f(rl)

f(y2) will tend to either 20 = 5 or 2u = -;,

First of all, we prove the following proposition: If the radius of convergence

is equal to 1 and an 2 0 for all n, then a = 1 is a singular point of f(z). 
Assume the proposition is false, i.e., z = 1 is a regular point of f, then for 
fixed 2 E (0,l) there exists a small real number 6 > 0 such that the power 
series expansion of f at point 3: is convergent at z = 1 + 6. Suppose the series

it is also a singular point of F(ze9"'). In other words, z = e-?4,i is a singular

is dense on {It1 = l}, we 
conclude that the unit circle {IzI = 1) is the natural boundary of F(z).

(b) If each fn is one-to-one on D, show that f is either constant or one-to-

(UC, 
Irvine) 
Solution. 
(a) First of all, we know from Weierstrass’ theorem that f is analytic on 
D .  Suppose f is pot identically zero, but has a zero point zo E D. Since the 
zeros of a non-zero analytic function are isolated, there exists T > 0, such that 
f(z) # 0 when 
z E {Z : 0 < I Z  - 
Z O I  5 T }  C D. 
Let m be the minimum value of If(.)/ 
on 
{ z  : Iz - z01 = T } .  
Then m > 0. As {fn} converges to f(z) uniformly on compact subsets of D, 
we know that for sufficiently large n, 
Ifn(z> - f(z>I < m 5 lf(z>I 
holds on {z : Iz - z0I = T } .  It follows from RouchC’s theorem that fn and 
f have the same number of zeros in { z  : Iz - z0I < T } .  Since zo is a zero of 
f ,  fn must have a zero in { z  : Iz - z0I < T } .  which is a contradiction to the 
assumption that fn(z) # 0 for all z E D. 

439 
(b) Suppose f is not a constant, and is not one-to-one on D. Then there 
exist zl,z2 E D (z1 # zz), such that f(z1) = f(z2) (denote it by u). Choose 
T > 0 sufficiently small, such that 
and f(z) - a  # 0 in {z : 0 < (z - zl( 5 T }  U {z : 0 < Iz - 221 5 T } .  Let rn be 
the minimum value of If(.) - a1 on { z  : IZ - zll = T or Iz - z2) = T } .  Then 
m > 0. With the same reason as in (a), when n is sufficiently large, 
I(fn(z) - a) - (f(z) - .)I 
= Ifn(z) - f(z)I < m L If(.) - al 
holds on { z  : Iz - zll = T or (z - z2( = T } .  It follows from RouchC’s theorem 
that f n  (z) - a and f(z) - a have the same number of zeros in {z : )z - z11 < T }  
and { z  : (z - 221 < T }  respectively. In other words, there exists 
2: E { z  : Iz - 211 < T }  
and 
z: E { z  : (z - z2( < T } ,  
such that fn(Z{) - a = 0 and fn(zi) - u = 0, which implies fn(z{) = fn(zi)

Since { f n ( z ) }  is a normal family, there is a subsequence { f n k ( z ) )  converging

Let T be sufficiently small such that f ( z ) - b  has no zero in { z  : 0 < Iz-u[ 5

uniformly to f on { z  : (z - a1 = T } ,  when Ic is sufficiently large, 
on { z  : Iz - a1 = T } .  By Rouche’s theorem, fnk(z) - b has zero(s) in { z  :

Since z , c  E D can be arbitrarily chosen, we obtain diam f ( D )  5 2, hence 
f(z) E 7, which shows that F is also compact. 
(b) Let { g , }  be any sequence of functions in Q. Then for Gn(z) = e-gn('), 
we have IGn(z)l < 1. Hence there exists a subsequence {Gnk} converging 
uniformly in compact subsets of D to a function G(z) which is either a constant 
or a non-constant analytic function in D. If G(z) is a constant, then the 
constant is e-l because 
~ ( 0 )  
= lim e-gn(') = e-1; 
if G(z) is non-constant analytic, since G,(z) # 0 for all z E D ,  by Hurwitz's 
theorem, we have G(z) # 0 for all z E D .  Hence we can define an analytic 
function g ( z )  = -log G(z), where the single-valued branch is chosen by g(0) = 
- log G(0) = 1, and we conclude that 
n-vw 
gn,(.) = -logGn,(z) 
converges uniformly in compact subsets of D to g ( z ) ,  which shows that family 
Q is normal. But family Q is not compact. First we can choose a sequence of

mapping gn exists and is unique, and it is obvious that gn satisfies all the con- 
ditions required by the family Q. Because the domain sequence {a,} converges 
to R = {w : (w - 11 < a} which is called the kernel of {R,} with respect to 
w = 1, by Caratheodory's theorem, { g n ( z ) }  converges uniformly in compact 
subsets of D to g(z) which is a conformal mapping of D onto 52. Since diam 
g(D) = i, g(z) does not belong to the family 0, which shows that

f(z) = w has a unique solution in { z  : 1x1 < p}. Denote the unique solution

is a meromorphic function whose only singularities in { IzI < N }  are simple

in (1.1

poles with residue n at z = -n. 
Because N can be chosen arbitrarily large, it is obvious that f ( z )  has all

0,1,2,3,. . -)? If Yes, give an explicit formula for g; if No, explain why not. 
(Illinois) 
Solution. 
(a) No. If there exists asequence of polynomials {P,} such that Pn(z) -+ 5 
uniformly on (1 < 1.1

that when n > N ,  IPn(z) - $1

both sides by )zI2, we have 
Because z2Pn(z) - 1 is an analytic function in (1.1 
< 2}, it follows from the 
maximum modulus principle that 
holds for all z E { Izl < 2). The contradiction follows by taking z = 0 in the 
inequality. 
(b) Yes. The function g can be chosen as 
where an = fi(1 + i). 
For any R > 0, let (z( 5 R and choose N > R2. Then when n 2 N ,  
It is easy to see that

Because C 5 converges, we know that 
n=N 
is analytic in {z : IzI < R}, which implies 
m 
is analytic in { z  : IzI < R}. Hence g(z) is analytic in {z : IzI < R}, and its 
zeros in {z : 1z1 < R} are 0,al,a2,...,ak (q 
- 1 5 IC < $). 
Since R can 
be arbitrarily large, we see that g(z) is an entire function with the required

False. 
We prove the assertion by contradiction. 
If for each positive number n there exists an entire function fn such that

Hence {F,(z)} is a normal family in { z  : ( z (  < 2), and there exists a subse- 
quence {Fnk(z)} 
converging locally uniformly to an analytic function F ( z )  in 
{ z  : IzI < 2). Since IFn(z)l 2 
for 15 IzI 5 2, F ( z )  cannot be identically 
zero, and by Hurwitz's theorem F ( z )  has no zero in { z  : 1x1 < 2). But we have

Let G = D\(-1,0], where D = { z  : IzI < 1).

Solution. 
(a) zi is defined by eil0gz. In domain G, single-valued branch of logz can 
be chosen. For example, a single-valued branch of zi in G can be defined by 
(c) Can the polynomials be chosen so that there exists a constant M with

(b) Choose

Because the complement of K, is connected and contains z = 00, we know by 
Runge's theorem that there exists a sequence of polynomials which converges 

449 
uniformly on K, to zi. In other words, we can find a polynomial Pn(z) such 
that 
for all z E K,. 
Hence {Pn(Z); n = 1,2, . .-} converges to zi uniformly on 
compact subsets of G. 
(c) No. If there exists M with IPn(z)l 5 M for all z E G and all n, 
then because Pn(z) are continuous on D, IPn(z)l 5 M for all z E D and 
all n. It follows that {Pn(z)} is a normal family in D, and there exists a 
subsequence P,, ( z )  which converges uniformly on compact subsets of D to an 
analytic function f(z) in D. Since Pn(z) converges to zi in G, hence zi = f(z) 
for z E G, which implies that z' can be extended to a single-valued analytic 
function in D. It is obvious impossible, so the contradiction is obtained.

Then g(z) is an entire function. 
As f(z) and

As the convergence of

the limit of the series for Imy -+ fco can be obtained by taking the limit in

(a) When x E R and 0 < t < 2 3 ,  the domain of dependence for the value

If both 4 and II, satisfy certain compatibility conditions, it is easy to see

equality (*) is valid for all functions f E Lq(B x [0, TI). Hence we have u 
0.

Consider the Cauchy problem for a function u = u(x, t), where x E B and 
t > 0. 
ut + a(z,t)u, = b(x,t), 
u(z, 0) = uo(x) E C(B2). 
a) Show that if b 
TV = “total variation”). 
b) Show that when b $ 0, one still has the bound 
0, then TV(u(., t)) 5 TV(uo(.)) 
for each t > 0 (where 
TV(u(*, 
t)) 5 TV(u0) + 
TV(b(*, 
5))ds.

Solution. 
The characterstic curves of the equation are given by the equation 
dx 
dt - 
= u(2, t), 
along which the solutions to the equation satisfy 
du 
dt - = b(x, t). 
a) Suppose that b 
0. Then u is a constant along a characteristic curve. 
We divide the line t = T into subintervals by the points * * , x - ~ ,  
. . * ,  2-1, zo, 
zl,. 
. . , z,,, -. .. Suppose that the backward characteristic curve through (xi, T) 
meets the line t = 0 at ( < i , O )  (i = - a * , -  
n,..., 
- l , O ,  l , - * - , n , - . . )  
. Then we 
have 
 xi,^) = uo(ti),

Therefore, we get 
TV(U(.,T)) 5 T V ( U O ( ' ) ) ,  
VT > 0. 
b) Let { z i }  and {ti} be given as in a). When b $ 0, we have 
u ( z i , T )  = uo(ti) + Ir 
b(zi(s), s)ds, 
0 
where by z = Zi(t) we denote the characteristic curve through ( z i , ~ ) .  From 
the above inequalities, we get
