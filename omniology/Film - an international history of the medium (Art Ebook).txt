FILM: AN INTERNATIONAL
HISTORY OF THE MEDIUM
hy Robert Sklar
This major new publication presents the entire span of
the film medium, from pre-cinema to the present,
in a
global perspective. By focusing on a historical
approach, yet including in
its framework such themes as
aesthetics, technology, craft, and social impact. Film:.
An International History of the Medium provides a
complete analysis of the principal films, directors, and
national cinemas as well as a thorough grounding in the
social, economic, and political foundations crucial to
an understanding of film as both art and industry.
The insightful, highly readable text covers not only
commercial and narrative film but also animation,
documentaries, art cinema, and the cinematic avant-
garde. All significant periods and styles are explored
extensively, with emphasis on the international relation-
ship among film communities in the areas of personnel,
influence, opposition, and innovation. Entire chapters
are given to the study of, for example, Italian Neo-
realism; the French New Wave; Soviet Silent Cinema;
Hollywood Genres; Documentary, Propaganda, and
Politics; and the Cinema of Liberation, and substantial
sections are devoted to the films of Eastern Europe, Latin
America, Japan, China, Africa, the Middle East, India,
and other non-Western cultures. Fascinating sidebars
amplify ancillary material introduced in the main text,
and six timelines place all the components in a histori-
cal context.
Film: An International History of the Medium is
beautifully designed and strikingly illustrated by more
than 750 film stills, frame enlargements, production
shots, and diagrams. The 120 full-color images include
rare examples of early hand-tinting, pre-cinema tech-
nology, two- and three-color Technicolor, and other
innovations as well as stills from modern films. These
large, stunning illustrations combine with the author's
penetrating analyses, wide-ranging perspective, and
lucid text to assure Film's great appeal to anyone with
an interest in the medium as well as in college-level
courses the world over. Notes, a selected bibliography,
a filmography, and a complete glossary of film terms
round out this extraordinary volume.
768 illustrations, including 120 plates in full color

Preface and Acknowledgments
Cinema
is a medium that refuses boundaries. Filmmakers move
between countries; films combine genres; film practices overstep
the limits of terms such as documentary, fiction, avant-garde. A
history of cinema differs from a dictionary or an encyclopedia in
its capacity to make connections, rather than impose categories.
The interrelations of the film medium at every level— from craft,
artistry, and textual citation to financing, distribution, and exhibi-
tion—shape the organization and argument of this book.
Given restrictions of space, how many films make an appropri-
ate number to include in a history of the medium? After attending
the inaugural Cannes Film Festival
in 1946, French critic and film
theorist Andre Bazin offered this observation: "Out of two or
three thousand full-length films produced in the world every year,
there are perhaps only about fifteen whose titles are worth
remembering, a half dozen that are worthy of mention
in the
future histories of cinema."
In this book, somewhat more than eleven hundred specific
films are mentioned, almost twice as many (extrapolating over
cinema's first century) as Bazin deemed worthy. But the criteria
for inclusion here are broader than his were at that moment.
Bazin was looking for masterpieces. A history of cinema recog-
nizes such great works of art, but also tells a different story: of the
medium's manifold levels of pleasure and function, derived from
elements such as technology, genre, craft, and performance, and
even from
its role in political propaganda.
Even so, more than eleven hundred films do not exhaust the
list of titles for which strong cases could be made. Many worthy
works have had to be excluded, and every reader may recall a
favorite film whose title or director does not appear in the text.
Some of my own favorites are missing.
Some notes on technicalities:
Film histories vary as to their method of assigning a date to a
film; some use year of production, some the year of first public
screening (say, at a festival), some the official release date. Julie
Dash's Daughters of the Dust, for example, was photographed in
1989, edited and completed in 1990, screened at festivals in
1991, and released in 1992. In this book, films are dated accord-
ing to the year of release in the country of origin (thus Daughters
of the Dust is dated
1 992); occasionally production dates are
added to note a gap of years between production and release.
On first mention, film titles are given in the original language,
with the English-language release title,
if any, in parentheses. In
those instances where there
is no English-language release title,
or when the English title varies greatly from the original, a direct
translation
is provided in quotation marks.
Illustrations of specific films are either drawn from publicity
stills or are frame enlargements. Readers should be aware that
publicity stills generally are not actual scenes from films as
recorded by motion picture cameras; rather, they are photographs
taken by still cameras before, during, or after a motion picture
shot. This difference accounts for the frequent discrepancy in
angle or movement that may be noted between a publicity still
and the shot as
it appears in the film.
A history of film depends, to alter a familiar phrase, on the
kindness of scholars.
In nearly every decade since the cinema
emerged, writers have contributed invaluable research or per-

sonal observations to our knowledge of the medium. A glance at
the Selected Bibliography will suggest how the pace of scholar-
ship has accelerated, and
its breadth has expanded, in recent
years. This book owes
its primary debt to all the historians of cin-
ema, past and present. Perhaps among
its readers will be a few
who discover here opportunities to develop and revise the always
incomplete project of cinema's history.
I want to acknowledge more specifically the remarkable
endeavors in film scholarship and screenings by the Italian film
organizations Le Giornate del Cinema Muto,
in conducting the
annual silent film retrospective in Pordenone, and Mostra
internazionale del Nuovo Cinema, organizer of annual festivals
in Pesaro and elsewhere, that have influenced and aided film his-
torians from many countries. Among Italian film scholars at these
organizations and others,
I thank especially Gian Piero Brunetta,
Lorenzo Codelli, Giuliana Muscio, and Vito Zagarrio for their
support and encouragement.
For innumerable courtesies and assistance in introducing me to
Chinese cinema,
I thank Professor Cheng Jihua of Beijing, China,
and Chen Mei, of the China Film Association, currently at the
Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences, Beverly Hills, California.
My approach to film history and historiography has been
developed in mutual exploration with students and colleagues of
the Department of Cinema Studies, Tisch School of the Arts, New
York University. Ann Harris, Cathy Holter, and their staffs at the
department's George Amberg Film Study Center supported this
project in many ways.
I also received invaluable assistance from
Charles Silver and Nancy Barnes of the Film Study Center,
Department of Film, and from Mary Corliss and Terry Geeskin of
the Film Stills Archive, The Museum of Modern Art, New York.
My graduate assistant, Peter Sacks, compiled the Filmography
and carried out other important research tasks for the book.
Others whom
I thank for providing aid and support include Akira
Shimizu, General Secretary, Japan Film Library Council, Tokyo;
Dr. Kyoko Hirano of japan Society, New York; Steve Ricci, Bob
Gitt, and Eric Aijala of the Film and Television Archive,
University of California at Los Angeles; Ellen Alderman, Lizzie
Borden, Gary Crowdus, Charles Musser, Maurice Schell, Leo
Seltzer, Elena Simon, Martin Sklar, George Stoney, and Norman
Wang.
It has been a pleasure to work with the staff of Harry N.
Abrams,
Inc., on this book. Senior Editor Beverly Fazio and
Senior Picture Editor John K. Crowley brought to the project their
enthusiasm and their exacting standards, and
I am grateful for
their commitment.
I thank also Paul Gottlieb, Sheila Franklin
Lieber, Julia Moore, and Bob McKee.
My daughter, Susan Sklar Friedman, a film editor, improved the
book in many ways through her expertise and assistance, and
I
was supported as well by my other children, Leonard Sklar, Kate
Tentler, and Justin Tentler. Adrienne Harris helped me in ways
beyond measure.
I am grateful to George and Norah Harris for
their encouragement.
This book
is dedicated to the memory of my mother, Lilyn
Fuchs Sklar (191 1-1992), and her sister, Frances Fuchs Dolin
(1905-1993), whose father screened movies for immigrant audi-
ences in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

ONE
NEMA, SOCIETY,
We should be wary of talking about
origins. The medium of motion pic-
tures (which here as elsewhere will be
variously and interchangeably called
film, cinema, the movies)
is a case in point. While we seek to
pinpoint exact beginnings to celebrate anniversaries and centen-
nials, the fact remains that large-screen projection of multiple
moving images forming a narrative has existed for centuries,
delivered by a variety of technologies. Claiming to specify where
things started begs more questions than
it answers. Let us speak
instead of an emergence—of cinema arising in a particular
moment out of a prior history, to captivate and dominate an
epoch, and destined perhaps to stand as prehistory to some other
medium of moving images preparing in turn to emerge.
THE PREHISTORY OF CINEMA
A shift away from an emphasis on origins casts new light on cin-
ema's prehistory—the period of motion picture devices and
entertainments before the development of filmmaking apparatus
in the
1 890s.
It makes possible a way of thinking about the past
that does not treat the narrative of time as, inevitably, a story of
progress: as
if we stood on the shoulders of our ancestors, grow-
ing bigger and better with each new generation. Earlier in time
does not have to mean, as
it sometimes has in modern histories,
less sophisticated, less civilized, more crude. While our machin-
ery undoubtedly has grown more sophisticated, the same
is not
necessarily the case for human mind or character, or for people's
capacity to experience what they have in complex and sophisti-
cated ways. We would do well to regard earlier times not as
diminished in relation to our own, but simply in some ways
different.
When this principle
is applied to cinema's prehistory, what
becomes apparent
is a rich and varied world of screen presenta-
tions in the time before movies.
If the cinema was something
new for spectators of the
1 890s, seeing larger-than-life projec-
tions of still and moving images was not. In Asia, shadow-
puppets formed a part of popular entertainment and ceremonies
for centuries; their most widely known manifestation appeared
on the Indonesian island of Java, where intricately perforated
puppets made of thin leather,
in lamplight, cast filigree shadows.
Different kinds of screen entertainment appeared in early modern
Europe. Inventors in the Netherlands in the mid-seventeenth cen-
tury used the sun as a light source (or at night, light from a
candle) to project images painted on a reflecting surface through
a lens onto a wall. Within a few years others had devised a pro-
jector which contained light source, image, and lens all
in one
portable apparatus. This was called the Magic Lantern.
Magic Lanterns
Over the next two centuries magic lanterns and their entertain-
ments became more and more elaborate. One of the most
impressive magic lantern presentations was the Fantasmagorie
(known in English as Phantasmagoria) staged by a Belgian, Etienne
Caspar Robert
( 1 763-1 837), who went by the name Robertson.
It
premiered in Paris in
1 798 and later toured Europe. With his audi-
ence on one side of a translucent screen, Robertson on the other
side had his lantern mounted on wheels. Moving the lantern.

Long before motion pictures
began in the late nineteenth cen-
tury, multiple-image screen
entertainment played a significant
role in popular culture. A travel-
ing exhibitor brings his "peep-
show" to a German country fair
in an 1843 lithograph by
F.
Schlotterbeck.
ANDSCIENCE
adjusting the lens to maintain focus, and using a shutter for dis-
solves, Robertson projected a macabre specter of skeletons,
ghosts, and other frightening figures simulating lifelike motion.
The development in subsequent years of dual- and even
triple-lens projectors made
it possible for operators to surpass
Robertson's spectacle without having to match his athleticism.
These machines smoothed the transition from image to image,
enabling ianternists to construct complex narratives out of multi-
ple slides in a manner not unlike a sequence of shots in a movie.
Magic lantern entrepreneurs put together a full evening's program
with segments such as travel scenes, popular science, art appreci-
ation, comedy, and melodrama.
Motion Toys
As screen entertainment for public consumption expanded in the
years before cinema, so too did devices proliferate for enjoying
moving images privately in the home. These are often thought of
merely as toys: small portable units that came with disks or paper
strips containing a sequence of images which, when set in
motion, gave the illusion of movement. Yet their origins lay in sci-
entific experimentation. Scientists in the
1 820s became intrigued
with a phenomenon thev called persistence of vision—the eye's
capacity to retain a visual image after its source has been
removed. A paper by Peter Mark Roget (1 779-1869, famous later
for his Thesaurus) prompted several efforts to construct mecha-
nisms that could turn separate still pictures into a single moving
image. Though the concept of persistence of vision continues to
appear in film histories, the term
is no longer accepted in the field
of perceptual psychology; the eye's capacity to retain a visual
image has become known as "positive afterimages," and
its con-
nection to the perception of apparent motion
is not clear.' No one
disputes, however, that motion toys produce the illusion of
motion.
Their inventors gave these devices high-sounding, tongue-
twisting names. The Thaumatrope (1 826, attributed to John Ayrton
Paris) was simply a round card attached to a string, with separate
but related drawings on either side: for example, a horse on one,
a rider on the other; when the card was spun, the rider appeared
to be riding the horse. The Phenakistoscope (early 1830s, several
inventors) was a plate-sized, slotted disk with a sequence of draw-
ings around
its circle; when the disk was spun in front of a mirror,
a person looking through the slots would see the drawings appear
to move. The Zoetrope (1 860s, also several inventors) was a
bowl-like device with a strip of drawings around the interior
circumference; when the bowl was spun, viewers peered through
slots in the sides to watch the drawings seemingly in motion. (The
name Zoetrope resurfaced in the 1970s when the United States
producer-director Francis Ford Coppola used
it for his production
company and studio.) The Praxinoscope, developed in the 1870s
in France by Emile Reynaud (1844-1918), was like a Zoetrope
only
it also utilized mirrors.
Theatre Ofptique
The instruments soon outgrew the home. They began to compete*
with magic lanterns in the public entertainment sphere. Reynaud,
after inventing the Praxinoscope, developed a projecting version,
using a reflector and a lens to enlarge the apparatus's moving
images (on the same principles of projection that had been used

for stiil images as far back as the seventeenth century). Continuing
his efforts, he constructed the Theatre Optique, an even more
sophisticated projection system. He drew pictures on long bands
which wound through the apparatus much like a reel of film
moves through
its own projecting device; his individual narratives
contained up to seven hundred separate drawings, and went on
for fifteen minutes. The Theatre Optique made
its debut in Paris in
1892 and lasted until 1900, when
it was undone by competition
from the cinema.
As screen entertainment, the Theatre Optique fell just short of
what cinema was to provide. Only
its lack of a catchy name may
have kept
it from enduring fame as a symbol of technological
futility,
like the Stanley Steamer, the steam-driven automobile that
failed the challenge of the internal-combustion engine.
RECORDED MOVEMENT
What Reynaud's device lacked was images of movement recorded
at the source. Ever since the development of still photography in
the
1 830s, inventors had been exploring ways to take a sequence

The Phenakistoscope was
one of the earliest of the
nineteenth-century motion toys.
A slotted disk with a sequence of
drawings was placed in a device
that rotated the disk; viewed
through a mirror, the rotating
drawings appeared as a single
moving image. The apparatus
is
attributed to several inventors;
this one was made by the French
optician Jules Duboscq.

anorama^
while we focus inevitably on the late
nineteenth centurx's historic transforma-
tion of moving image technology and
culture, the end of the eighteenth centurv'
also marked significant innovation in
screen entertainment. The era of the
1 780s-90s saw not only Robertson's
Fantasmagorie and other enhanced magic
lantern programs, but also the panorama,
a large-scale painting designed to take up
the complete interior circumference of a
circular building. What
is credited as the
first of these opened in Edinburgh,
Scotland,
in
1 788, and the idea spread to
London and France. lOn this principle,
the Walt Disne\ companv opened at
its
Disne\land park in 1955 a circular mov-
ing image photographed by eleven
cameras, called Circarama.) Strictiv
speaking, the early panoramas were not
moving images, but smaller-scale ver-
sions were produced lor home use, some
on scrolls which could be unrolled to
create an illusion of movement.
In the early nineteenth century an ele-
ment of "movement
" was introduced into
public exhibitions of static pictures
through the diorama. (One of its develop-
ers was Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre
[1789-1851], who later became an
inventor of photography.) The diorama
involved either a single painting or a can-
vas painted on both sides. Audiences sat
in front of the work as shifts in lighting
produced changes in the image. In the
case of two-sided paintings especially.
torama :>
diorama shows offered narratives of visual
spectacle—changes in the weather, in
seasons, from day to night—that effected
substantial transformations and lasted up
to fifteen minutes with a single work.
As with the panorama, the magic
lantern, and motion toys, the diorama
concept was developed into products for
home entertainment. A popular diorama
toy was the Polyrama Planoptique, a view-
ing box into which pairs of slides could
be inserted. By manipulating a hinged i!H,
the viewer could shift the light so as to
effect a visual transformation.

of photographs rapidly enough to record a movement in all
its
phases, not just arrest a single image. These efforts gained the
substantial support in the 1870s of the railroad tycoon and for-
mer governor of California Leiand Stanford, who was determined
to find out whether a trotting horse ever had all four legs off the
ground at the same time. To settle the question, he hired British
emigre Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904), well-known
in
California as a wilderness photographer.
Muybridge's Horse
Muybridge's famous experiments, begun in 1872, culminated in
1 878 with a sequence of photographs that proved, yes, a horse
did have all four legs raised at once. He placed twelve cameras
in a row alongside a track, spread threads across the track, and
attached them to a contact with each camera's shutter. As the
horse moved,
its legs broke the threads, causing the cameras to
operate in sequence. The result was a dozen photographs
showing successive phases of a horse's gait. Within a year he
expanded the system to twenty-four cameras with timed elec-
tronic controls, which made the sequence more accurate than
the thread method. The international acclaim for Muybridge's
achievements prompted him to go out on the lecture circuit, and
he joined the world of screen entertainment with his own version
of a magic lantern device, the Zoopraxiscope. This was a pro-
jecting version of the Phenakistoscope, using rotating disks on
which were painted images of horses in motion drawn from his
sequence photographs (he discovered, however, that he had
to elongate the drawings in order for the projected illusion of
movement to look "natural"). Over the next decade he greatly
publicized the possibilities for sequence photography of motion.
Etienne-Jules Marey
Among many whom Muybridge stimulated was the French scien-
tist Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904), a specialist in animal
motion. When he utilized the photographer's methods, however,
Marey found them inadequate for recording birds in flight. He
adopted a device developed by an astronomer, Pierre-Jules-Cesar
Janssen
( 1 824-1 907), for recording the transit of the planet Venus
across the sun. Marey 's version, developed in 1882, was a "pho-
tographic gun" equipped with a disk functioning as a shutter to
record sequential images on a rotating photographic plate. This
worked well to capture the flight of birds, but
it was limited to

twelve separate images. As a next step, Mare\' devised a station-
ar\' camera (called a chronophotographic camera) that could take
a considerably greater number of images superimposed on one
another, producing a single picture of motion for scientific study.
The pace of development quickened. In England, France,
Germany, the United States, and elsewhere during the 1880s
inventors and entrepreneurs worked on machinery
for motion
photography. Key advances in the still photographic field came
from the work of the American inventor and manufacturer
George Eastman (1854-19321. In 1885, with William H. Walker,
Eastman developed a new kind of recording material to replace
individual coated glass or gelatin plates: sensitized paper, coated
with gelatin emulsion, on a roll, called film. In 1888 Eastman
introduced a box camera with the film roll loaded inside
it, under
the trade name "Kodak." A vear later, the paper roll was replaced
bv celluloid, a synthetic plastic material invented in the 1870s,
which utilized the chemical compound cellulose nitrate. Marev
immediately took up this innovation for his chronophotographic
camera, constructing a mechanism that could move roll film
through the apparatus, hold
it still momentarily for an exposure
to be taken, and systematically repeat the operation. This fulfilled
his desire for an ample number of separately recorded images of
movement, for research purposes. Almost alone among the many
experimenters in the medium, Marey was uninterested in carrying
his work forward into the world of screen entertainment.
Thomas Alva Edison
The patent offices in England and the United States began filling
up with plans for motion picture inventions. All eyes naturally
turned toward the famous laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey,
when Thomas Alva Edison
( 1 847-1 93 1
), creator of the phono-
graph and the electric light bulb, staked out his claim for primacy
in the field. Decades of research and debate have considerably
tempered the view, once widely held, that the development of
motion pictures sprang full-blown from Thomas Edison's brow. By
the time Edison expressed interest in the subject he had become
in any case more a business executive than a hands-on scientist,
and the actual labor of invention was assigned to employees in
his lab. Edison brought to the inventors' competition, however,
his own carefully crafted international celebrity and business
21

power, and he was bound to change the way the game was
played.
Edison entered the field in 1888, well behind the stage that
others had attained. His lab in fact wasted a year fruitlessly
attempting to develop a motion picture recording device on the
model of the cylinder with which Edison had constructed a
sound recording machine.
It was not until Edison visited Marey
in 1889 and observed the roll film mechanism that his effort
began to appear practical. Though
roll film was obtained from
George Eastman immediately on Edison's return, the lab was
occupied with other projects until 1891
. In that year Edison's
British employee, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson (1860-1935),
constructed and demonstrated versions of both a motion picture
camera, the Kinetograph, and a machine to view the pictures,
the Kinetoscope.
THE KINETOGRAPH CAMERA.
Dickson's crucial accom-
plishment was the sprocket mechanism for advancing the film.
The celluloid roll was perforated at regular intervals, and a

In 1878 the British photog-
rapher Eadweard Muybridge, at
the behest of California railroad
tycoon Leiand Stanford, set out to
determine by sequence photogra-
phy whether a trotting horse ever
had all four feet off the ground at
once. Workmen set up the experi-
ment at Stanford's farm. The shed

whose shutters are attached to

it trots by, thus tripping the shutter

toothed wheel driven by an electric motor moved the film forward
with precision. (Several other early cameras also had electric
motors, but such cameras were bulky and generally stationary;
these gave way to hand-cranked cameras, lighter and more
mobile, which required individual op)erators to determine film
speed.) Although the first Kinetograph p)ositioned the film hori-
zontally in the motion picture camera (like standard still photo
cameras of a later erai. the improved machine moved the film ver-
tically. With vertical placement of the roll, the Edison labs
decided on a 35mm width for the film strip, which was eventually
to become an industr\ standard. For the time being, however,
early cameras utilized a variety of film widths and camera speeds.
The basis of motion picture cinematography was the exposure
of individual frames on the film roll through a shutter mechanism.
While some early cameras exposed as few as ten frames per sec-
ond (f.p.s.), the Edison/Dickson camera operated at about
40 f.p.s., and that too emerged as something of a norm; later
silent cameras were operated generally
in the range of 18 to
22 f.p.s., and the standard for sound film became 24 f.p.s. The
Edison/Dickson camera in most respects provided the basic

design for recording movement on film that has lasted with
little
change for one hundred years (though the electronic recording of
images by video camera,
is, of course, fundamentally different).
THE BLACK MARIA.
Further improvements in the apparatus
led to public exhibitions in
1 893 and the opening of commercial
viewing parlors in 1894 in the United States, France, and England.
To foster the commercial development of his devices, Edison also
constructed a studio on his laboratory grounds. This was a shed-
like structure built on a turntable to follow the sun, with a roof that
opened to let in sunlight, and walls of black tar paper. The staff
called
it "the Black Maria" because they thought
it resembled the
police patrol wagons of the era, which went by that nickname. In
early
1 894 vaudeville performers came over from New York to
record their acts for Edison's camera. With film rolls 50 feet in
length, these films lasted about twenty seconds, a single shot from
PROJECTED FILMS
By that time, however, the first projected motion pictures had
already been demonstrated in France. The inventors were the
brothers Auguste and Louis Lumiere (1862-1954; 1864-1948),
who ran in Lyons an important firm for manufacturing photo-
graphic equipment. Knowing of Edison's work, they sought to
compete with an apparatus of their own. What they came up with
in early
1 895 was a device whose versatility surpassed any
previous invention. Called the Cinematographe,
it was a light-
weight, hand-cranked machine that advanced the film roll through
a claw mechanism. They found that
it not only could operate as a
camera but could be used to throw large-sized images onto a
screen when
it was linked with projecting equipment familiar from
magic lantern shows. With their Cinematographe, they shot films
and projected them for select groups repeatedly during 1895. At

1893. Using a magic
lantern, individual frames were
projected before an audience of
several hundred; then people
lined up to view the complete
film in the Kinetoscope, one at a
time. This event has led early-
cinema historian Charles Musser
to call Blacksmith Scene "the first
commercial-length modern
motion-picture subject to be pub-
licly exhibited.

a stationary position, without editing or camera movement. At the
same time Edison's company was manufacturing the Kinetoscope
viewing machines. These were box structures containing a motor-
and-shutter mechanism much like the camera's that ran a loop of
positive film past an electric light source. The spectator peered
through a small window to see the image. Originally the machines
could only accommodate, like the cameras, 50 feet (or twenty
seconds) of film, but within a few months some were modified to
hold
1 50 feet of film, about a minute of screen time. Edison made
deals with several firms to sell them both Kinetoscopes and films
to show in them. A Kinetoscope parlor opened in New York in
April 1894.
Edison and Dickson had apparently given
little attention to the
possibility of projecting their images. They continued to operate
from the example of the phonograph, which had successfully
been marketed in public commercial spaces with instruments for
individual listening. The long tradition of magic lantern screen
entertainment, however, with large-sized images projected before
large-sized audiences, suggested both the technical and economic
inferiority of the Kinetoscope "peep shows." Edison's achievement
only spurred others to surpass him by inventing a motion picture
projector. Dickson joined the effort when he left Edison's com-
pany in April 1895.

motion pictures for the general public came on December 28,

Inventors in Germany, England, and the United States were on
their heels. In Berlin, another pair of brothers, Emil and Max
Skladanowsky (1859-1945; 1863-1939), projected films with
their Bioscop apparatus, which featured two film strips whose
frames were alternately exposed, in November 1895. In London,
the Kineopticon projector of Birt Acres
(1 854-1 91 8) showed films
in January 1896;
it was based on a camera that Acres had earlier
developed with Robert W. Paul (1869-1943), which in turn
derived from Marey's chronophotographic camera (Acres went on
to devise in 1899 a low-cost camera, the Birtac, for nonprofes-
sional use—what would later be called "home movies"). The first
American projector was developed by Charles Francis Jenkins
(1 867-1 934) and Thomas Armat (1 866-1 948), later by Armat
alone in a commercial arrangement with Edison. The projector,
the Vitascope, which used sprocket wheels to advance the film,
was marketed as an Edison product and made
its debut on April
23, 1896, at Koster & Bial's Music Hall in New York.

THE ADVENT OF
MOTION PICTURES
Before considering more closely the films exhibited at these early
screenings, we should sto[i back for a moment to reflect once
more on our sui)jecl: the emergence of motion pictures at the end
of the nineteenth century. From our later position in historical
time, we may say that we are observing an awesome moment
launching a phenomenon that changed the world. But w/iy did
26

this happen? In the annals of technologv, industry, and culture, no
triumph
is foreordained, no success guaranteed. F^tent offices are
crammed with models and drawings for inventions that never got
out of the laborator\. There are innumerable stories in the world
of commerce of products introduced with great fanfare that, as
it
turned out, nobody wanted to buy. Along with the press notices
that expressed amazement at projected recordings of movement,
there were other voices predicting that moving pictures, like
man\ another novelty, would have no more than a brief moment
of popularih. then pass from the scene. Let us not take cinema's
triumph for granted: rather lets look for reasons wh\
it managed
to surv ive and grow.
To begin at a basic, industrial level,
it was important that the
principal economic entrepreneurs of rinema—the Lumieres in
France, Edison in the United States—owned major manufacturing
firms with other successful business operations. The\' possessed
"deep pockets" to overcome the innumerable problems that
could arise, and did: shortage or inferiority of films, mechanical
difficulties, inadequac\ of exhibition sites, and audience dissatis-
faction, not to speak of legal battles or political pressures. The
early history of motion pictures was far from an unbroken string
of successes. Hailed at first for their startling simulations of real-
ity, with familiarit\ moving pictures could easily seem inadequate
to their initial premise.
Realism
what was "real" enough for the purposes of Marey's research
mav appear quite different in the realm of screen entertainment.
Unlike the "real" world, the eark moving pictures were black-
and-white (two of the films shown at Edison's first projected
screening were tinted bv hand, frame b\ frame, but this practice
was rare in the first \ears of cinema). Unlike the "real" world,
they were silent unless accompanied bv live music, voice, or
sound effects. With rare exceptions the eark films lasted no more
than a minute or so, providing onk
brief glimpses or quick
vignettes. A full evening's program consisting solely of movies
was implausible from an entertainment point of view. Films were
shown along with magic lantern projections and live presenta-
tions, and integrated as an added attraction to existing
entertainment forms: varieh shows, traveling lectures, carnival
midways, vaudeville programs.
Rep'roducibility
Mavbe "realism," after all, was not what spectators were looking
for from the cinema.
If that was the case, howe\er how could
movies hope to compete w ith the magic lantern? Shows like
Reynaud's Theatre Optique offered the full possibilities of fiction
and fantas\
; thev had color and sound, and thev made for a satis-
factory evening's entertainment. Again, at a basic, industrial level,
the cinema possessed a capacit\' that the magic lantern shows
could not match: reproducibilit\'. A single negative could strike a
large number of prints. They could be screened in many places
simultaneousk. Indeed, within weeks and months of the first pub-
lic exhibition of projected movies, Lumiere representatives and
other operators w ith portable cameras had spread throughout the
world, showing films and photographing new ones. By July 1896
the Cinematographe had reached Bombav, India, and St. Peters-
burg, Russia. Film screenings took place soon thereafter in
Australia, Egypt, China, Japan.
A Global Medium
The cinema became a global phenomenon in a way the magic
lantern never could. Though lantern screen exhibitions may have
been familiar in all those far-flung places, lantern shows were the
work of individual craftsp>ersons, who could not match the vol-
ume and variety of the nascent cinema. In this sense the earlv
motion picture belonged to a different world, not merely of
screen entertainment but also of global communications. The
1 890s also saw the development of the linotype machine for
7.27.

printing of newspapers. A cheap mass press emerged which
made
its money not from circulation but from ad\ertising rev-
enue. The cinema was a part of these end-of-century
transformations in information and consumption.
Visual Reporters
Much of the interest in eark cinema came from
its role as a
visual reporter of current events. B\
1 898 a Lumiere catalogue
(the seventh issued in the space of tvNO \earsi listed one thousand
titles, virtually all of them actuality films shot by the brothers or
acquired from overseas cameramen who used the Cinemato-
graphe or a portable camera from another manufacturer. Most of
these films were simply scenic, but they also recorded,
in the
manner of a later era's television news, such scenes as the
1 896
flood in Lyons and the Russian czar's \ isit to France. The scenics
were also news of a kind; in an era of military and imperial
expansion, spectators in Europe and the United States could have
strategic or personal concerns for faraway places, as well as sim-
ple curiosity. Films also reconstructed important happenings and
took the form, so to speak, of editorial commentarv. Some early
films that have survived have appeared completely inexplicable,
with few internal references to guide the later spectator, but
research in contemporary newspapers indicates that thev were
based on highly publicized events with which spectators of the
time would have been familiar.

Film Propaganda
The medium's ties to newsworthy events was a significant aspect
of its capacity to endure. When such happenings were scarce, cin-
ema slumped. This was the case in New York City in early
1 898,
and vaudeville and variety theaters simply pulled films from their
programs. Then growing hostilities between the United States and
Spain gave American filmmakers a crucial boost. Photographing
patriotic subjects—sometimes just a shot of the American flag
waving—they joined the mass press in fomenting a war spirit over
Spain's colonial possessions in the Caribbean. Using portable,
hand-cranked cameras that Edison and other companies manufac-
tured, several cameramen went to Cuba and photographed sites
of military incidents there. Films of troops marching or preparing
their expedition were supplemented by naval battles staged with
miniature models or sham combat shot in New jersey. Audiences
cheered these films in vaudeville theaters.
Cinema and Urban Society
If information—and propaganda—were apparent aspects of the
cinema's early appeal,
its relation to the growth of cities at the turn
of the twentieth century was also significant, though perhaps less
obvious. Movies,
it was true, could be shown anywhere—projec-
tionists with their own electric generators indeed carried
the medium to remote outposts. But in rural areas cinema was an
occasional program or a special event, while in cities movies
became part of the fabric of daily
life.
The worldwide development of cities involved internal migra-
tion and external immigration, vast movement of peoples,
rootlessness and cultural dislocation.
It created new spaces for
consumption and self-display: restaurants, department stores, cov-
ered arcades for strolling and shopping.
It increased the tempo of

life and the mingling of strangers. Emerging as a new medium on
programs deriving from older entertainment forms (vaudeville,
variety, magic lantern), the cinema slowly began to find a place in
the experience of spectators commensurate with their habits and
needs in city
life.
It was cheaper than many other performance
events, and shorter;
it could squeeze into converted spaces along-
side stores, train stations, and other places that drew the mobile
crowd; spectators who could not read or speak the local language
could
still enjoy the show.
Cinema and Women
Historians have increasingly emphasized the opportunities for
social experience that cinema provided for female spectators.
Theories of cinema had stressed that the medium's pleasures were
almost exclusively male—that the primary place of women was on
screen as objects of men's gaze. By locating cinema as an aspect
of late-nineteenth-century urban consumer culture, however,
it
has been possible to recognize the historical importance of cin-
ema for women. Situated among shops and cafes, the movie
theater extended the world of consumption through
its screen win-
dow on space, fantasy, and narrative. Female spectators, just as
men, could find there the freedoms of pleasure and desire—to see,
and to be seen (not just on screen). Since women have frequently
made up a majority of filmgoers, the cinema's possibilities for
female spectators are surely among the reasons the medium sur-
vived, took root, and thrived in modern culture.
EARLY FILMS
The Lumiere Brothers
what the Lumieres showed at their December 28,
1 895, screening
in Paris was a hit with all categories of spectators. The original
program contained ten films and lasted about twenty minutes.
Since the brothers had many more than ten films by the end of
1895, subsequent programs were constantly changing, and some
films were retitled as well. A compilation film currently circulating
that bills itself as "Films Shown at First Lumiere Program" has pre-
served some of those early films over the decades, even though
it
includes some that were not shown on December 28, and
excludes some that were."
Because of these complications, what came first and what came
a few weeks later no longer particularly matters. However the
Lumieres altered their programs, they began nearly all of them
with La Sortie de I'Usine Lumiere a Lyon (Workers Leaving the
Lumiere Factory), which conveyed, by the numbers pouring out of
the gate, just how big an operation they ran. Work was a subject
of many of the early Lumiere films— including Les Forgerons {The
Blacksmiths) from the first program and a slightly later, better-
known film. Demolition d'un mur {Demolition of a Wall, 1896)
as were also military scenes. The film that had earlier been taken
at and shown to the delegates at the photographers' congress, Le
Debarquement du Congres de Photographie a Lyon (Debarkation
of Photographic Congress Members at Lyon), was also part of the
first and many subsequent programs,
in which were recorded,
among others, the cinema pioneers Marey and Janssen. Le Repas
on the first program,
later renamed Repas de bebe {Feeding the
Baby), provided a contrast to the public scenes of most of the films
with
its intimate glimpse of a mother and father feeding a baby, as
a kind of prototype for home movies (and, for scholars, a glimpse
into bourgeois family
life).

1.29.
The Lumieres' Arrivee d'un
train en gare (Arrival ot a Train at
La Ciotat,
1896), a single-shot
film, shows a train arriving at a
station and the passengers getting
off; despite its apparent simplicity,
it provides evidence of how a
film's visual style is shaped.
Several of the most famous early Lumiere films were not part of
the first program, though often identified as being so. These
include Arroseur et arrose (Waterer and Watered,
1 896), a remake
of Le lardinier (A Little Trick on the Gardener] from the first pro-
gram, and Arrivee d'un train en gare (Arrival of a Train at La
Ciotat,
1 896). Arroseur et arrose dramatizes what was a well-
known cartoon sequence: Boy steps on gardener's hose, stopping
flow of water. Gardener stares into nozzle, wondering what's
wrong. Boy releases pressure, gardener is squirted in the face.
Gardener spanks boy. This comedy was one of the earliest exam-
ples of intertextuality in the cinema—the way a text absorbs and
transforms other texts,
in this case the newspaper cartoon.
Arrivee d'un train en gare is a single shot of a train pulling into
a station and passengers getting off. This film has attracted atten-
tion for its formal properties. From the platform, the camera
observes the train in the distance approaching the station (legend
has
it that some spectators panicked as the engine came "closer").
The train stops;
its passengers alight and move out of camera
range. Rather than passing this off as simply a moment of unmedi-
ated reality, critics have pointed out
its aesthetic implications,
suggesting how every recorded image is an intervention, a media-
tion. As the train arrives, the film becomes a sequence of events,
varying from distance to close-up. Though the events themselves
are accidental, subject to chance (the passengers had not been
coached to act in certain ways), the filmmaker's decision to set up
his camera in a specific place established a certain manner of pre-
senting the unstaged. The filmmaker was,
in a way, a director,
constructing a basic mise-en-scene—the French term, adopted
from the vocabulary of the theater, that
is widely used to denote
the totality of a film's visual style: placement and movement of
camera and performers, decor, lighting,
all that appears before the
camera.
Edison's Program
The first presentation of Edison's Vitascope four months later in
New York did not have the same impact on spectators, nor has
it
provided grist for later critical analysis. Edison mostly put on the
screen films that looked exactly like those that had been appear-
ing in the Kinetoscope viewing machines for the previous several
years—works shot inside the Black Maria against a black back-
ground, presenting moving figures in a kind of spatial void. The
one widely praised film at the Vitascope debut was a shot of
crashing waves at the seaside, and
it had been filmed in England
by Birt Acres and supplied to Edison by Rfjl)ert W. Paul
Edison may have gotten a message when most of the acclaim
went to the wave film (its original title was A Rough Sea at Dover,
but
it was changed to Sea Waves in the United States to make
il
appear a local product). Shortly after the Kosler & Bial screening,
Edison began to rely less on the stationary Black Maria camera
and sent cameramen with portable cameras out into the world to
shoot "actualities" on the model of Acres and the Lumieres.
During
1 896 they filmed Shooting the Chutes at Coney Island, a
waterfall, a train, a fire truck pulled by a horse, farmyard scenes,
and several short outdoor comedies in the manner of Arroseur et
arrose.
Despite the initial successes of projected motion pictures, the
early months were a time of disorder and shakeout in the new
medium. Expectation exceeded technology, and technology out-
ran manufacturing capability. Competition intensified— in addition
to the primary French, British, German, and American projectors,
another important machine came onto the scene: the Biograph,
manufactured by the American Mutoscope Company (the firm
soon changed
its name to American Mutoscope and Biograph
Company and eventually shortened
it to Biograph Company).
Soon another dozen different projecting devices were on i::e
market.
Lumiere remained dominant both in Europe and in North
America, but in early 1897 United States customs officials threat-
ened to prosecute the company's American employees because of
improper customs documents—what could have led to that dra-
conian action?—and Lumiere shut down
its American operations.
Indeed, having put together by
1 898, as we have seen, a cata-
logue of one thousand films, the Lumieres began to curtail their
motion picture activities. There has never been quite a full expla-
nation for this, other than that the company had more than
it
could handle in the manufacturing of photographic and motion
picture film stock. The Lumiere catalogue of 1903 contained more
than two thousand titles; then, in 1905, they abandoned film
production.
Georges Melies
Besides the Biograph company, the most significant newcomer to
motion pictures after the first wave of screen projections was the
magician Georges Melies (1861-1938). He came to filmmaking
from the entertainment field rather than from that of technology
and invention, the background of nearlv all his competitors. Since
1888 Melies had performed magic tricks and shown lantern slides
in his Paris theater (called the Theatre Robert-Houdin, after a
famous nineteenth-century French magician!. When he began
making films in 1896, he worked in the Lumiere manner, shooting
little comedies, everyday scenes, and travel views. But he also
tried out a few of his own and other magicians' tricks on film.
Stage illusions could be accomplished more easily just by stop-
ping the camera and moving or substituting objects, such as in
Escamotage dune dame chez Robert-Houdin
( The Vanishing
Lady, 1896), where a seated woman
is replaced by a skeleton. (In
Edison's 1895 Kinetoscope film Man, Queen of Scots, the camera
was stopped so a dummy could replace a performer before a
beheading was carried out; this substitution, however, was para-
doxically in the service of realism, without having to sacrifice the
life of a performer, while in Melies
its purpose was to go beyond
29

One of the most arcane, yet significant,
aspects of early movie history
is the con-
flict over patent rights. Basically,
inventors apply for patents in order to
insure that they will be able to gain
income from their investment of time,
money, ideas, and labor—that someone
else cannot simply copy the invention
and sell
it at a cheaper price or in a
glitzier package. In the case of motion
pictures, the question of patents revolved
around the work of Thomas A. Edison's
laboratory: could Edison or could he not
claim to patent as his invention the basic
mechanism of the motion picture cam-
era?
After several rejections and extended
legal struggle, Edison's claim was first
upheld in 1897. Though numerous court
battles were to come, Edison was quickly
able to force some competitors out of
business or require them to operate their
equipment only
if licensed by him. One
that was able to resist him, however, then
and for some time after, was the com-
pany operating under several different
official names but generally known as the
Biograph. When the Lumieres gave up
their activities in the United States in
1897, Biograph became the principal
American film company.
Biograph began competing with Edison
in the days before large-screen projection
when
it devised
its own peep-show
viewer, the Mutoscope.
Its film frames
were printed not on a strip or reel (as in
Edison's Kinetoscope) but on separate flip
cards, which were activated by a hand
crank to produce the illusion of motion.
Before they could market the Mutoscope,
however, they needed films, and so they
developed a camera, originally called the
Mutograph. William Kennedy Laurie
Dickson, who had devised the sprocket
mechanism that became the successful
basis for Edison's camera patents, assisted
Biograph in constructing a mechanism
that operated on different principles:
rollers gripped and advanced the film. A
similar apparatus was utilized in the
Biograph projector.

realism, to create a transformation that could not be witnessed
in actuality.)
Melies brought the fantastic to the cinema—he was heir to the
screen tradition of Robertson's Fantasmagorie. He has been cred-
ited as originator or precursor of such long-lasting film genres as
horror, science fiction, and dark comedy.
In the familiar dictum of
film history Melies was the founder of cinema fantasy as the
Lumieres were of film realism. In Jean-Luc Codard's
1 967 film La
Chinoise {The Chinese), however, made in an era when many
truisms were questioned, a scene presents a lecture on the early
history of cinema: Melies
is the founder of realism, the Lumieres
of fantasy. Even such parody or excess can make the point that
the past
is always open to reinterpretation, redefinition of terms,
and the potential transformation of accepted wisdom, just as in a
Melies film.

Primitive cinema
is a name that has often been
H
used to describe the era of filmmaking and the
I
culture of moviegoing in the United States and
^^^^^^^
western Europe from their beginnings up to
around 1910. The term's purpose
is not to
explain the apparent oddities in early films that sometimes pro-
voke laughter from latter-day audiences; rather
it
is to make those
presumed oddities understandable (and thus no longer laughable)
by clarifying some fundamental differences between early cinema
and what followed.
It seeks to replace the notion, once quite com-
mon, that the history of film was a story of something that began
as comically bad and slowly got better and better. The concept of
primitive cinema suggests that early filmmakers held a different
idea about how a film should be made, and that filmmaking did
not "improve" (though there were obvious technical advances) so
much as shift to an entirely new perspective on the medium. From
this viewpoint, early movies become comprehensible within their
own setting; also, the norms of mainstream cinema that have
dominated most of the twentieth century no longer are regarded,
as they sometimes have been, as the apex of an inexorable histori-
cal progress.
REDISCOVERY OF
EARLY CINEMA
As a historical term, primitive cinema came into currency in the
1970s with the discovery and restoration of hundreds of pre-1910
films. This opened the way to a richer and more varied viewpoint
/I

on the period than had been possible with the handful of surviv-
ing prints—some not in their original form—that had previously
been available. The old linear perspective on the evolution of film
style and technique gave way to a recognition that cinema devel-
oped through debate, controversy, and struggle. One such period
of strife erupted around 1910 when the expansion of audiences,
changing industrial structures, and political pressures, among
other factors, exposed deficiencies in primitive cinema and led to
its decline. The decade after 1910 was a time of transition
which,
in the United States, also marked a shift in film production
from east to west coast—that ended with the full-scale emergence
of a new mode, associated with the Hollywood studio system.
This new mode has sometimes been called classical cinema.
Early Cinema and the Avant-Garde
To a certain degree, the revised viewpoint on eady cinema was
formed
in a framework of opposition to the standard Hollywood
product of the studio era.
In the 1970s, when a vigorous and influ-
ential independent film movement flourished, parallels were
drawn between primitive cinema and the modern avant-garde as
common alternatives to the mainstream mode. From the notion of
film history as progressive development, many aspects of early
cinema had been criticized by historians on the supposition that
eady filmmakers only slowly came to understand the stylistic
potentials of the medium. From the new perspective, what had
been seen as inadequate now came to be regarded as authentic
and autonomous ways of representing time and movement on
screen.

2. 1.
Primitive cinema became
popular in amusement parks and
fairgrounds as well as in urban
vaudeville and peep-show enter-
tainments. The Bioscope was an
attraction at a British amusement
pier around 1900:
it was a projec-
tor devised tor Charles Urban
(1871-1942), an American who
worked in Britain after 1898 as a
traveling exhibitor and motion
picture entrepreneur
Film as Spectacle
Central to this reassessment was the notion of primitive cinema
not primarily as a narrative story-telling medium but as a type of
presentation or exhibition— similar to an act on a vaudeville pro-
gram or an attraction on an amusement park midway. What drew
audiences was the allure of spectacle.
in early films, the camera was likely to be stationary and at a
considerable distance from the performers, mimicking the situa-
tion of a seated theatergoer. When the camera moved or a closer
view of action was presented,
it was in the service of spectacle
rather than story, as in Biograph's Photographing a Female Crook
(1904), where the camera (mounted on wheels or tracks) begins
a shot with a distant view of the criminal suspect, and then
advances to show in close-up her horrific grimace. A number of
films, such as Uncle Tom's Cabin (1903), directed by Edwin S.
Porter (1870-1941
), drew on well-known dramatizations and
were likely to follow a format of discrete scenes in the stage
manner, rather than creating a close-knit moment-to-moment
narrative. After the demise of primitive cinema, commentators for
years derided
its adherence to theatrical conventions and
its
inability to construct a distinctive new cinematic "language." In
the revised view, however, early film provided the spectator a
visual and emotional distance, a contemplative stance, whereas
the later mainstream cinema sought to evoke explicit and deter-
mined audience responses.
CINEMATIC TIME
One of the most subtle areas of difference between primitive cin-
ema and the dominant modes of later years lay in their separate
approaches to temporal continuity. The modern cinema has
treated time as a flow. You can leap backward in time (as in flash-
backs, where past scenes are interwoven with a film's temporal
present! or adjust
its tempo (as in sequences where movement
is
slowed down or speeded up), but time inexorably moves forward.
The primitive cinema took an attitude toward time with which we
have once again become familiar through the instant replay of
televised sports. You see an event, time
is temporarily arrested,
then you see the event again, often from camera positions differ-
ent from the first, or "live," presentation. This
is a form of visual
simultaneity outside time's flow. Modern cinema creates an
impression of visual simultaneity v^ithin time's flow through
editing, showing several alternative perspectives on action while
time continues
its movement. Primitive cinema said,
in effect,
let's stop time and look at that from another angle.
Melies
The pioneer French magician-filmmaker Georges Melies (see
Chapter
1
) exemplified primitive cinema's concept of time as
repeatable, rather than endlessly flowing. His 1902 fantasy film
Le Voyage dans la June (A Trip to the Moon) begins with scenes of
preparation for the departure of a rocket to the moon. Then we

Life ofan American Fireman
Perhaps the most extended (and controversial) instance of primi-
tive cinema's different form of temporal continuity came
in
Porter's Life of an American Fireman (1902). This mixture of actu-
ality and fiction footage opens with a series of shots depicting the
operations of a fire station as
its wagons answer a call— a fire
alarm
is pulled, the firemen leap frc^m bed and slide down the
ladder, the wagons roll out of the station and race along the
street. The film's second half, equal
in length to the first, depicts
a rescue scene, with interior and exterior views of the firemen
carrying a woman and child from a burning house.
For years the available prints of Life of an American Fireman
showed this rescue scene (the film's second half) as a thirteen-
shot sequence. After the first shot of the woman inside the house,

The p
.
,
rjrmiton
"The Brighton School"
is a name often
invoked in connection with early film his-
torN'. Primarily
it denotes two filmmakers
who worked in the British seaside resort
Brighton in the first years of cinema:
George Albert Smith (1864-1959. and
lames Williamson (1855-1933). Along
with other British pioneers, they have
often been overshadowed by figures from
countries that became more prominent
and powerful
in the early history of cin-
ema, such as George Melies in France
and Edwin
S. Porter in the United States.
The Brighton filmmakers gained
renewed attention when film historians
began to question traditional claims to
stylistic innovation, particularly those of
D. W. Griffith, who had asserted that he
was the inventor of a host of filmmaking
techniques. A look back at the work of
Smith and Williamson, along with other
early filmmakers, makes clear that certain
cinematic techniques—such as point-of-
view shots, close-ups, and moving
camera shots— occurred much earlier
than Griffith and others had claimed. The
larger point, however,
is that try ing to dis-
cover who went "first," who could be
called the "inventor" of a technique,
is
fruitless. A considerable range of stylistic
elements appeared from the beginning in
earlv cinema and were widely diffused,
though their use was often haphazard;
Griffith deserves credit not for inventing
them but for using them in a completely
different way from the earlier filmmakers,
as part of a new narrative style.
Smith's and Williamson's films shared
the spectacle and presentational aspects
of primitive cinema that marked Porter's
works. In Smith's Grandma's Reading
Class (19001 the gimmick, as
it were, of
seeing what Grandma sees
is the whole
point of the film. Williamson made
Attack on a Chinese Mission Station

event,
in the manner of American films
on the war in Cuba, and
F/'re i1902i as
part of what amounted to a fire-rescue
genre. Both Smith and Williamson made
magic and trick films in the Melies fash-
ion. Like Porter and Melies, their careers
chool
as filmmakers substantially ended with
the transition away from primitive cinema
around 1910.
However, Smith by that time had
become active in developing color film-
making. In 1906 he secured a patent on a
two-color filmmaking process that uti-
lized the Bioscope equipment of Charles
Urban.
It photographed black-and-white
film through a rotating wh€?el with red
and green filters, so that each frame was
alternately exposed to one or the other fil-
ter. The black-and-white positive print
was then projected with red and green
lights, the red light shining on the frames
exposed to the red
filter, and the green
light accordingly. Smith and Urban pub-
licly introduced this system, which they
called Kinemacolor, in 1908. The process
was considered quite effective in giving
the appearance of natural color, and
Kinemacolor films were made and suc-
cessfully exhibited into the 1920s, when
technologies incorporating color into the
film negative began to supersede
it (see
Chapter 8).
as the exciting rescue
is carried out. Allowing the spectator to see
multiple perspectives as the action proceeded, this was \ isual
simultaneitv of a remarkable sophistication for that earl\ day and
was regarded as the finest example of advanced editing tech-
niques in the early cinema. The trouble
is,
it was not the way
Porter put the film together.
This became an issue when a Library of Congress copyright
submission was restored. The film's first half was exactly the same
as in the extant version, but
its second half, the rescue scene, was
presented
in just two shots: first the interior from start to finish,
then, going back in time to the beginning of the rescue, the exte-
rior from start to finish. The authenticity of this two-shot version
was confirmed when an original print of Life of an American
Fireman was discovered in the state of Maine.
It showed that
Porter's concepts of editing and temporality were similar to those
of Melies, and both were different from those of "advanced" edit-
ing and
its notions of visual simultaneity.
When one
is aware of the differing structures of perception that
separate primitive from modern cinema, the way a film like Life at
an American Fireman repeats time from varied perspectives can
be more fully appreciated. After all,
it
is not so alien an idea.
Literary texts employ a similar convention so frequently
it
is
scarcely noticed;
first an event
is narrated from one character's
viewpoint, then
it
is gone over again through the eyes of another
character. But this basic literary device also points up w hv earlv
films can seem confusing to later-day spectators. Temporal repeti-
tions in literature are rooted in points of view that shape and
define the action. Early cinema often failed to provide such
anchors.
The sense of contemplation that early cinema fosters in specta-
tors can easily shift over into bafflement. The screen image at
times simpK provides insufficient information. Who are these
people? What are they doing? Where in the frame
is the signifi-
cant action taking place? EarK audiences may have found answers
to such questions by being familiar w ith the stories; or,
in manv
cases, theaters employed lecturers who narrated the action, fol-
lowing synopses provided by the filmmaker. (There were even
instances when actors were hired to stand behind the screen and
read lines of dialogue.) But as the popularity of cinema grew in
its
first decade, and as the films became longer and their narratives
more complex, spectators at that time also sometimes became
puzzled. Audiences and economics were at the heart of the strug-
gles over primitive cinema that erupted around 1910
hut so too
was a crisis in film style and form.

EDWIN
S. PORTER
I ne ynei histor\ oi pfimiii\t cinema
!s encapsulateo
if
of Edwin S. Porter. Hailed in his own time and b\- f>oste
most important filmmaker oi cinema's tlrst decade. Porter in estiy
1909 was removed from his post as head of tllm production at the
Edison companv and was tired several months later. In the \ ie%N of
his emplovers, his method of filmmaking and his concept of what
a tllm should be had become outmoded. After 1915 he was no
kMiger acti\e in making films, though he lived for another quarter
centurN. Porter's strengths and limitations do not soIeK' account
for, but are central to, both the triumphs and decline of primitive
cinema.
Like mam other eariy tllmmakers. Porter was drawn to cinema
through an interest in its mechanical rather than
its artistic devel-
opment. He began his film career as a projectionist and traveling
exhibitor.
It was his skill with machines that led the Edison com-
pam- to fHrt him in charge of its motion picture production in earh
1901. As he set about organizing the compjarn's new studio in
New York Citv, be helped to define the illmmaker's responsibili-
ties in the eariv \ears. The range of his tasks is also perhap>s one of
the reasons later commentators hav'e linked the primitive cinema
to avant-garde practices: though he often worked with others.
Porter was at various tirries <and sometimes all at oncet the person
who operated the camera, directed the actors, processed the
r>egativ«, edited the tllm, maintained the equipment and paid
the bills.
One thing he was not able to do. at the beginning of his labors
with Edison, was control the wav* his companv's films would
appear on screen. Most films were still quite brief and consisted of
a single shot. To make an attractive program, a theater operator
interspersed films among magic lantern slides, live entertainers,
audierKe sing-ak)ngs: exhibitors might construct a theme or an
order for the various items on a program that relegated a film to a
minor role or gave
it an emphasis different from the filmmaker's
purpose. One of FVxter's challenges was to make kxiger films that
could give cinema more prominence and autorKxnv' in the
exhibition setting: these r>ecessarilv invohed going beyond the
single-shot film, taking a series of separate shots and editing them
together into a 'chain" of images.

Vtore prominent in the popular theatrical and literarv cultures, on
which the movies also drew, was the spectacle of crime and vio-

lence. Porter, like other filmmakers, utilized these subjects fre-
quently, though he was unusual in sometimes treating crime as a
social and moral issue rather than solely a subject for exploitation.
Two examples are The Ex-Convict (1904),
in which a man released
from prison
is driven by ostracism and his family's need to commit
another crime (but finds redemption through a good deed he has
done), and The Kleptomaniac (1905), which shows the justice sys-
tem treating unequally a rich woman and a poor woman who are
caught stealing.
The Great Train Robbery
But
it was crime preeminently as spectacle that Porter emphasized
in the work that was to become the most famous film of the primi-
tive cinema, The Great Train Robbery (1903). This film has
received so many diverse accolades— credited for establishing the
Western genre, the "story" film, indeed the commercial success of
the motion picture medium
itself—that its character as film has
sometimes been
lost sight of. As a genre work, as a story. The
Great Train Robbery was in no sense original: certainly not in rela-
tionship to similar works of popular literature and theater, or even
to earlier films.
Its power lay in
its diverse demonstration of cin-
ema's special strengths.
The Great Train Robbery encapsulated the medium's capacity
to place the spectator within
its space, to simulate the spectator's
"presence"
in movement and action. The camera's eye could situ-
ate the viewer in the midst of a scene, as when, placed atop a
moving train,
it observes robbers entering its field of vision from
the bottom of the frame—behind the spectator's standpoint—and
attacking the engine crew. With separate shots edited together,
moreover, the film could give the spectator an unequaled sense of
spaciousness and breadth, of having access simultaneously to
multiple standpoints: the train from several angles, a station, a
dance hall, several outdoor scenes. And by moving the camera, or
moving the action in relation to the camera,
it offered unprece-
dented visual immediacy: the aura of, and the terror at, witnessing
senseless, violent death, as when one of the train's captured pas-
sengers bolts toward the camera,
is shot by the robbers, and falls
in close view before us. The spectator's vicarious vulnerability
is
vividly reinforced
in the final shot, a close-up of a sheriff taking
aim and shooting point-blank at the camera.
Challenges and Contradictions
The Great Train Robbery, while exemplary of primitive cinema,
also exposed
its contradictions:
its capacity to involve the specta-
tor heightened the elements of spectacle but also broke down the
distanced, contemplative viewpoint that primitive cinema had
inscribed. Yet the involvement
it offered was more visceral than
emotional, providing only fleeting opportunities for feeling, or
identifying with,
its fictional characters.
These contradictions were to be more fully exposed
in Porter's
work over the next few years. The Great Train Robbery's enor-
mous success with audiences marked a decisive turn in primitive
cinema toward narrative, or story films. The Edison company's film
sales (which had actually declined in 1902 from 1901
) began a
gradual improvement that soon turned into a spectacular leap. The
first challenge was an increasing demand for "product," and that
meant determining the variety of subjects an expanding produc-
tion company should offer. Porter's output included further
Westerns, more comedies, "chase" films (these were a type of
comedy that had a brief vogue, chronicling the mishaps of people

versions of classic theater works, fantasy, and trick films.
But the more daunting challenge was to explore the logic of the
contradictions that The Great Train Robbery laid bare. What was
the relation between spectacle and narrative, between identifica-
tion and emotional distancing?
If they grasped the force of these
issues, Porter and the Edison company may have been too pre-
occupied with other demands, such as maintaining volume of
production, to cope with them fully. The "Teddy" Bears (1907)
highlights the difficulty. Part of the film recounts the children's tale
of Goldilocks and the Three Bears; part of
it depicts the United
States president, Theodore Roosevelt,
in a hunting episode that led
to the naming of the "Teddy Bear" doll; and another part
is an
elaborate sequence of "Teddy Bear" dolls animated through stop-
motion photography. Spectacle
is interspersed with narrative,
fantasy turns into realism, and identification becomes emotional
distancing in a way that causes modern audiences to gasp in
astonishment, as fantasy bears with whom we have been led to
identify suddenly become indifferent targets of the president's
rifle. This remarkable film marked a crisis of the primitive mode.
Within less than half a decade Edwin S. Porter went from the
leading filmmaker in the United States to an outmoded and fading

appeared incongruous in indoor

Cooper-Hewitt company had
come into use; these supplied a
diffuse and even light, which

figure. (The Edison company did not survive much longer as a
production entity, so the difficulties were clearly institutional as
well as personal.) A way of putting this phenomenon in context
would be to compare
it with another rapidly expanding and trans-
forming industry, such as computers in the late twentieth century,
where enterprises founded in inventors' garages became multi-
million-dollar businesses, and companies that had once led their
field soon afterward went bankrupt.
In the early cinema, artisans
like Porter who had taken responsibility for every technical,
artistic, and managerial aspect of filmmaking found themselves
especially vulnerable to the industry's changing nature.
THE TRANSFORMATION
OF EARLY CINEMA
The development of early cinema did not exactly take place on
what one would call a level playing field. Edison, having begun to
challenge his competitors in legal actions as early as the 1890s,

Company's studio in Philadelphia, pho-
tographed around 1910. Three scenes are
being shot simultaneously on the glass-
walled stages.
A glance at the accompanying illustra-
tions will indicate why the primitive
cinema's mode of production could not
last. As early as 1907, when the two stu-
dios pictured here were constructed in
the United States, the demand for motion
picture "product
" required an increase in
output that a single individual could not
encompass. As late as 1907, conversely,
Edwin S. Porter attempted to continue
the mode of production he had devel-
oped nearly a decade earlier, as a person
responsible for all facets of the filmmak-
ing process— from preparing the story, to
running the camera, to developing and
cutting the celluloid strips. But under
these methods he was unable to produce
either the volume or quality of films that
new industrial circumstances required,
and
in 1909 the Edison company fired
him.
The mode of production that replaced
the primitive was, to a degree, transi-
tional. Production companies set up
story departments to prepare scenarios
(the word then used to describe outlines,
treatments, or scripts) and write inter-
titles. Cinematography became a
specialization, while postproduction
tasks were given over to technicians.
Directors, however, remained central to
the process:
in the course of working
with performers and the camera operator
they could improvise or alter story lines
and, of course, determine the style of a
film through camera placement, length
of takes, and other on-set decisions.
These directorial prerogatives soon
came into conflict with management
desires that filmmaking be not only artis-
tic but businesslike— that schedules be
adhered to, budgets maintained. A new
position was created, called supervisor.
This figure often came from the ranks of
directors, who were familiar with all
phases of filmmaking, but as the industry
developed what became known as the
"studio system," the title shifted to pro-
ducer and
its holders came from the
business and management side. Pro-
ducers worked most closely with story
departments, since preproduction activi-
ties such as casting, set construction,
budgeting, and schedule making all
depended on what was in the script. By
1913, as the trade journal Motion Picture
News reported, companies were handing
"a working script up to a director with
strict orders to produce
it."
continued after 1900 to file suit after suit alleging patent viola-
tions. Though the courts continued to define his role as inventor
quite narrowly, his tactics harassed and financially hindered other
film companies. In addition, with copyright provisions pertaining
to films vague or nonexistent, companies felt free simply to make
a duplicate print of someone else's film, slap on a new title, and
sell
it as their own. Producers combated this tactic bv placing
their company logos or symbols on the walls of sets, so these
would show up unmistakably in shots. With duping thus hindered,
pirating took the form of reshooting a competitor's film, some-
times on a straight shot-for-shot basis. Some of the large film
companies opened overseas offices, the better to protect rights in
their products, hastening the internationalization of the motion
picture trade.
The Decline ofMelies
Not every film company, even among the most notable, was a
success story. Georges Melies in France, though he was different
from Edwin S. Porter as the owner of his own company rather
than an employee, also had difficulty with the changing circum-
stances of film production. Unlike the Edison company, the
Lumieres, and several other French and British producers, he did
not manufacture related technical devices as an additional source
of income and a capital base. His films were expensive and labor-
intensive—they required multiple changes of costume, elaborate
painted backdrops, and intricate trick photography (which
involved stopping the camera and changing the scene to make
it
appear that an instantaneous magical transformation had
occurred, as in a sequence where a man loses his head,
headlessly hunts for
it, then restores
it).
Economic and structural changes in the film industry, requiring
increased production and greater management organization, were
probably the most severe challenges to Melies's survival, rather
than aesthetic obsolescence. Yet the unchanging conventions of
his magical productions also began to fall out of favor. One of his
most ambitious films, Le Palais des Mille et une Suits
t The Palace
of the Arabian Nights, 1905), displays Melies in all his grandeur
and contradiction. More than twenty minutes long,
it contains

duction company. Originally dealing in the phonograph, the firm
under Charles Pathe (1863-1957) became an important manufac-
turer of motion picture cameras (its professional studio camera,
introduced in 1905, had
its hand crank on the back instead of the
side, and was favored bv cinematographers), and began making
films as vvell. The Pathe company logo, a rooster silhouette, was
for a time the movie industry's most familiar symbol: besides
its
Paris studio, Pathe operated a studio in the United States and pro-
duced films in Russia.
Pathe led the way in 1907 in transforming the relationship
between producers and exhibitors. Instead of selling film prints
outright to theater operators, as had previously been the case,
Pathe rented
its prints, retaining ownership; this change, soon
emulated bv other producers, enabled the companv significantiv
to expand
its distribution network, and
it opened offices in cities
throughout the world to rent
its films. Ferdinand Zecca (1864-
1947) was the companv's production head and principal director.
Though in the forefront in quantity of production, Pathe films
have been regarded bv film historians generally as derivative of
those of other filmmakers, with an output consisting largeK of
simple trick films and comedies— a judgment,
like all others in
cinema history, perhaps open to challenge.
Gaumont
A second French companv, Gaumont, based like Pathe in equip-
ment manufacture, also moved ahead of Melies.
Its founder, Leon
Gaumont (1864-1946), looked upon filmmaking as a sideline,
and so turned production over to his secretary, Alice Guy (1875-
1968), with the proviso (as she later wrote) that
it not interfere
with her secretarial duties. From 1896 to 1905 she was the firm's
only director, and produced as many as four hundred films. Later,
as Alice Guy Blache (she married Herbert Blache, who also
became a film director), she ran her own production companv in
the United States— at Fort Lee, New Jersey— and directed man\
more films from 1910 to 1920.
Britain
In Britain, a similar pattern of transformation occurred, but with a
difference. While earlv leaders such as Robert W. Paul dropped
out of the business in the manner of Porter and Melies, their com-
petitors were not new British entrepreneurs but French and
American producers, who were said bv 1910 to control together
85 percent of the British market. Perhaps the one figure with a
continuous career in the eady decades of British cinema, Cecil
Hepworth (1873-1953), was more like Edison than Porter, a pro-
ducer rather than a director. His most important production
in the
era of primitive cinema was Rescued by Rover {]905), directed by
Lewis Fitzhamon. This was a particularly well constructed "chase"
film with twenty-two separate shots. A gypsv steals a baby from
an inattentive nanny. The dog Rover follows her to a hideaway,
then fetches the baby's father and guides him to the kidnapper's
lair. This was one of many films made in nearly every country
about dangers posed by outsiders and criminals to the bourgeois
family.
United States
Edison's legal challenges against his rivals were the shaping influ-
ence on the first decade of cinema
in the United States. Biograph,
Edison's most formidable competitor, had trouble raising capital
and lost key personnel. The Vitagraph Company of America,
another important early producer, was forced by court decisions
concerning infringements of Edison copyrights and patents to pay
Edison a royally, then to cease production entirely. The firm sur-
vived by operating as exhibitors (showing European films) until
another court case in 1902 limited Edison's patent rights and
allowed Vitagraph to resume production.
Still, given the uncer-
tainty of the legal picture— Edison was continuing to sue others,
and there was always the possibility of new judgments in Edison's
favor—Vitagraph showed
its films only in
its own theaters until
1905, when the expanding market for films persuaded the com-
pany to build a studio in Brooklyn, New York, and offer films to
other exhibitors. Vitagraph's early history
is an example of the way
the development of the medium was held back in the United
States by legal struggles. After being curtailed for more than five
years, the company— headed by
j. Stuart Blackton (1875-1941
)
and Albert E. Smith (1875-1958)— quickly demonstrated a knack
for making popular entertainment films and returned to the top
rank of American producers.

THE NICKELODEON ERA
Throughout the world, around 1905, the primary site of movie
exhibition began to shift from fairgrounds and vaudeville houses
to permanent motion picture theaters.
It
is logical to assume from
this movement that spectators from wealthier and more educated
classes were becoming interested in films and wished to see them
in new, clean, well-appointed theaters. This was certainlv the
case in a number of countries, though
in the United States other
forces were at work as well. A hot debate has been waged for
some time among film historians over the relative extent to which
bourgeois or working-class values and concerns shaped develop-
ments in the American cinema after 1905. Hovve\er one views
the American situation,
it is clear that from an international per-
spective the primitive mode of cinema production was coming
under pressure from both the higher and the lower ends of the
social hierarchy.
What made the United States different in this historical moment
was the rapid expansion of its industries and cities fueled b\ an
influx of immigrants from southern and central Europe. Many of
47

these newcomers came from agricultural regions and were new to
factor\ work and citv lite. Too poori\' paid to afford \audeville
prices and working such long hours that thev had little time for
amusements at all, this population proved a fertile opportunit\ for
entrepreneurs, themseK-es often immigrants, who found a wav to
offer them inexp>ensive popular entertainment—the five-cent
movie theater, or nickelodeon.
It
is no coincidence that these the-
aters first made an impact in such hea\il\ industrialized centers of
immigrant settlement as Pittsburgh and Chicago. Within a couple
of years there were many hundreds of nickelodeons across the
United States.
This expansion of exhibition generated enormous profits—at
first for the exhibitors more than the producers.
It occurred sev-eral
vears before Pathe led the switch from selling to renting films, so
in the beginning of the nickelodeon boom producers received
only their original price for a print, regardless of how many times
the print was screened and how man\ people saw
it. Once the
rental svstem began, payment varied according to length of time,
number of screenings, audience size, and box office receipts (and
the exhibitor's honesty
in reporting these figures). Renting films
necessitated setting up a new
tier of organization, the film
exchange, w hich handled distribution of prints to exhibitors. A
new le\el of complexit\ entered the industn,-: with higher profits
came a demand for increased production, an elaborate s^'stem to
control prints, and, for the first time, critical feedback from audi-
ences, exhibitors, the expanding entertainment trade press, arid
concerned social and cultural organizations.

This critical feedback from different groups marked the emer-

medium's qualities—and deficiencies— now became a focus tor
public debate. Social organizations concentrated on the moral

prices would be given access to films, which would drive cheap
working-class theaters out of business, pleasing the reformers.
Producers would not suffer because fees for film rental would be
raised, and the cut in demand for films would give them more
time to deal with the critique of primitive cinema's film style.
Beginning in late 1907 a series of producers' meetings led to a
pact among Edison and a number of companies who agreed to
become Edison licensees, paying royalties to Edison and partici-
pating in the plan to rationalize the industry. Among the firms
joining were Pathe and Vitagraph; some production companies
and film importers were excluded. A side arrangement was struck
with George Eastman whereby he would supply raw film stock
only to member producers. After months of fierce battles,
Biograph and
its allies also joined, and
in 1908 the Motion
Picture Patents Company, an attempted monopoly over the indus-
try, was formed.

Censorships
One of its first acts was to cooperate with social organizations
in the establishment of a National Board of Censorship. This
voluntary group screened films in advance of release and recom-
mended cutting or, on rare occasion, banning outright those
it
found immoral. One goal of the board was to curtail the prolifera-
tion of municipal and state censorship bodies throughout the
United States. In this
it was not notably successful,
in large part
because local groups considered the board too much in collusion
with producers. The cultured, well-to-do volunteers were perhaps
more effective in applying traditional aesthetic values to the
movies, adding their influential voices to the chorus calling for
higher standards.
The Spectator's Place
As a new power structure emerged for the industry and culture of
cinema— shaped by the producers' monopoly, the censorship
board, social organizations, and critics— where did the spectator,
the paying customer,
fit in? With primitive cinema entering a
period of crisis and decline, some film historians in recent years
have seen the triumph of a monolithic bourgeois ideology with the
imposition of a new narrative cinema that quashed variety, experi-
mentation, and the possibility of cultural resistance. There are
certain conceptual problems, however, with this view.
It
is not
quite accurate to regard primitive cinema as either non-narrative
or antibourgeois, and the influx of working-class patrons into the
nickelodeons only highlighted the need for change.
The history of cinema
is not a case of either/or. The cinema of
spectacle, a feature of the early era, survived primitive cinema's
demise and has remained significant
in mainstream genres as well
as avant-garde films ever since. Though the new narrative system

shaped film texts as more unitary and psychologically involving
viewing experiences, moviegoers do not invariably turn into the
passive, solitary, absorbed spectators postulated by some film the-
ories. Going to the movies can be a communal event where
active, oppositional viewpoints are clearly voiced, and social his-
torians have shown how
it frequently served that purpose for
immigrant and working-class audiences
in the years of early cin-
ema. Nevertheless, we need to avoid romanticizing the "resisting"
spectator as well.

DAVID WARK GRIFFITH
No name
is more closely associated with the development or nar-
rative cinema than that of David Wark Crit'tith (1875-1948).
Though the rediscoveries and reevaluations of early cinema have
called into question many of his claims to stylistic originality, they
have recast our view of his achievement rather than diminished
it.
The idea of originality itself is what
is most suspect: all art
is inter-
textual, and a popular hybrid form such as cinema— with
its early
history of pirating and duping— brazenly so. Griffith may have
originated very
little, but in his sustained accomplishments as a
film director at the Biograph company from 1908 to 1913 he has
few equals in the medium's history.
D. W. Griffith was a poet, playwright, and stage actor before
entering motion picture work as a performer. His assumption
of directorial responsibility at Biograph marked a shift toward

creative personnel from allied arts instead of inventors and
mechanics like Porter.
It also highlighted the increasing subdivi-
sion of creative tasks: someone else operated the camera, another
department supplied the stories, and
if Griffith had a hand in edit-
ing his films, he surely did not have to go into the lab and process
them. This collaborative structure freed him up for his principal
effort—to put on film some twenty to thirty minutes of screen
time per week.
Biograph was committed to releasing two one-reel fiction films
and a shorter half-reel film every week, as part of the Motion
Picture Patent Company's plan to maintain a steady supply of
films to participating exchanges and approved exhibitors. In the
early cinema (and later to become standard terminology) a reel of
film designated the film spool that was loaded onto the projector;
each spool, or reel, could hold 1,000 feet or 305 meters of film.
Because the amount of film on each reel varied, as did projection
speeds, film duration
in the silent cinema was typically given
in
number of reels and/or feet or meter length. With all these vari-
ables, one reel on screen might last from ten to fifteen minutes.
Many films longer than one reel had been produced by 1908, and
the Patent Company's decision to make the one-reel film
its norm
appears to reflect a business rationale— for efficiency, standard-
ization, and product flow— rather than an aesthetic or even a box
office judgment. Griffith's ability to produce distinctive and innov-
ative work under this breakneck schedule assured his and
Biograph's emerging leadership.
The Lonely Villa
Griffith had directed more than one hundred films in less than ten
months when he made perhaps his most important early work,
The Lonely Villa (1909). This is— there
is no other way to describe
it— a direct steal from a 1908 Pathe film that has survived with
its
British
title, Physician of the Castle. But
it
is not a shot-by-shot
remake in old pirating fashion. Though the Bi(jgraph film almost
exactly follows the other's narrative, the well-construe led Pathe
work told
its story with twenty-six shots, while Griffith more than
doubled that number, to fifty-four. Both films recount a well-worn
tale of bourgeois danger. Intent on robbery, or worse, criminals
lure a man away from his isolated home with a false message and
then proceed to terrorize his wife and children— until a last-
minute rescue. Physician of the Castle makes effective, fast-paced
use of both theatrical and exterior space. Using the same ele-
ments of mise-en-scene (inside and outside, constructed and
natural space,
is all there
is), Griffith builds something different,
what we might call narrative or cinematic space.
Cinematic Space
Herein
lies the significance of Griffith's more than doubling the
number of shots in the earlier film. Since the films are approxi-
mately the same running time, shortening the length of individual
shots and increasing their number, coupled with rapid shifts from
one location to another, has the effect of creating a metaspatial
world, a "beyond" space or multispace that exists only on the
cinema screen. Questions of temporal continuity that have been
raised concerning primitive cinema— are these events occurring
simultaneously or sequentially?— now become irrelevant as the
shot chain (the shaping of a narrative through a sequence of sepa-
rate shots) constructs
its own screen-time and the images leap
from location to location
in a rapid flux. The retreating mother
and children futilely barricading doors; the inexorably pursuing
criminals, the madly dashing husband/father, racing against
time—these form a narrative out of time and space.
Analytical Editing Style
The term for alternating among different locations
is called cross-
cutting (that
is, when a series of shots cuts back and forth among
two or more separate spaces). The term for shifting between posi-
tions within the same space
is called shot-countershot, implying
a relation between the camera setups in the sequence, such as
two persons in the same room whose viewpoints are alternately
presented. These practices are both elements of what critics have
called the analytical editing style. This describes the way that an
action or several actions that occur as continuous movements
without interruption are "analyzed" or broken up into a series of
discrete images, involving different camera setups and separate
shots, and then reconstructed at the editing stage from individual
fragments into a multi-image whole, to create a cinematic experi-
ence of time and space different from direct perception.
Narrative Intelligibility
The point was to make a film narrative intelligible without previ-
ous knowledge of its story, without the aid of lecturers, with all
5/

Films in color became
more widely available with the
advent of tinting and toning,
which involved bathing black-
and-white positive film in a dye.
This enabled the full frame
image, and entire sequences, to
be colored, and was less expen-
sive and time-consuming than
hand-tinting individual frames.
Colors were chosen to
fit mood

company of Naples.
the necessary information contained within the frame, on the
screen. In the analytical system of multishot scenes, increased
emphasis was placed on insert shots, which had occurred less
frequently in primitive cinema (such as in The Gay Shoe Clerk,
noted above). These were close-up shots directing the spectator's
attention to a specific element of a wider scene that was of narra-
tive importance and would leave a viewer confused
if
it were not
noticed— for example, a gun hidden
in a pocket, or the location
of a missing object for which characters were searching. Insert
shots could heighten suspense and viewer involvement by giving
the spectator privileged knowledge not possessed by characters
onscreen; they guarded against a problem of the primitive cin-
ema, where key details were sometimes so underemphasized that
spectators were
left puzzling in the dark.
Another element of narrative clarity was the use of intertitles.
These frames of printed text had been utilized occasionally in ear-
lier years but became a standard feature only as an elaboration of
the new narrative system. Intertitles could announce a change of
scene or location, give dialogue lines, guide the spectator by
summarizing in advance the next scene's action, or comment edi-
torially along the lines of, "Such are the wages of sin." Along with
other elements of narrative intelligibility, they placed narrative
control more firmly in producers' hands; they made
it less likely
that exhibitors would cut or reedit films to
fit their own program
requirements, and, as film historian Tom Gunning has written, the
new system of narration worked "as a sort of interiorized film lec-
turer."' Live voice accompaniment gradually disappeared from
movie theaters, except in Japan, where the narrator— called ben-
shi— grew in importance throughout the silent film period.
The shift to the new narrative mode was not an inexorable pro-
gression.
It was perhaps most apparent in contemporary genres
like comedy, crime, and domestic melodrama.
In films drawing
on literary sources there was a tendency to revert toward the
presentational style of primitive cinema. Another of Griffith's sig-
nificant early works, A Corner in Wheat (1909), was based on
writings by the American novelist Frank Norris. Since The Lonely
Villa Griffith had directed nearly seventy films, yet A Corner in
Wheat was made with less than half the number of shots than the

earlier film: twenty-four, as against fifty-four.
It was among the
most trenchant social critiques in early American cinema—the
poor go without bread as "the wheat king" corners the market and
lavishly celebrates his coup— and
it adopted a slower pace with
tableau-like shots of the suffering poor. (The wheat king does suf-
fer the wages of sin, falling by accident into a bin at the granary
and suffocating under the flow of the commodity that made him
rich.)
Griffith's feat of personally directing more than 140 films in
1909 was a remarkable achievement, and the system of film narra-
tion he was developing would transform the medium. Yet from an
industrial perspective his working methods represented the old
primitive cinema as much as or more than they did the new
production practices and filmmaking goals that were becoming
apparent, in terms of production, Vitagraph,
in contrast, utilized
half a dozen directors and twice as many camera operators to
make some 170 films in that same year, pointing to the large-scale
operations that would characterize later studio modes of produc-
tion. Outside the sway of the Motion Picture Patents Company
(which included European producers such as Rathe) filmmakers
were rejecting the one-reel and half-reel lengths as industry stan-
dards. Italian director Giovanni Pastrone (1883-1959) captured
attention
in Europe and the United States with La caduta di Troia
{The Fall of Troy, 1910), a historical epic two reels in length whose
ambition and narrative breadth made the one-reeiers look puny
by comparison. As the changes of 1908-9 eliminated the contra-
dictions of primitive cinema, they introduced new contradictions
of their own:
in particular, a well-regulated, upwardly mobile film
industry could not curtail the desire of filmmakers and audiences
alike for a medium that offered not just quarter-hour entertain-
ments, but a place among the arts.

THREE
LM AS ART AND
The transformation of filmmaking in the decade after 1910
had barely begun before sweeping new claims were made
for the medium
in the realms of culture, philosophy, and
art. Motion pictures were said to be the first new art form
of the modern era. They spoke in images accessible to all nations,
all ages,
all stations in
life. Philosophers linked the movies with
their theories of perception and knowledge; psychologists com-
pared the movies to dreams. Avant-garde writers and visual artists
drew on formal properties of cinema for their own work.
Here was a new medium and art form of almost unlimited
potential,
in the eyes of many, yet in
its everyday reality
it
remained predominantly an inexpensive popular entertainment,
produced for profit. A debate was begun in the decade after 1910
about the relation
in cinema between art and commerce. That
it
could be commerce was already amply proven; that
it could be
art— could achieve aesthetic significance for
its practitioners and
spectators— was becoming more certain year by year. Whether
it
could be both at once, and
in what proportion, was a matter of
contention and continues to be so to the present day.
D. W. GRIFFITH AND
NARRATIVE STYLE
During the decade from 1910 to 1920 few
if any films were made
for other than commercial purposes, yet among commercial film-
makers at least a few claimed for their work the status of art. Chief
among these was D. W. Griffith. He continued as perhaps the
world's most prolific filmmaker, personally directing more than
eighty one-reel films in 1910, more than seventy in 1911, more
than sixty in 1912, and around forty in 1913, when he left
Biograph because the company would not allow him to make
longer films (several two-reel works and one of four reels, Judith
of Bethulia 11914], which Biograph had reluctantly permitted him
to direct, were released after his departure). He joined a produc-
tion firm that gave him the opportunity to make films of four reels
or more.
In his years at Biograph Griffith steadily advanced the narrative
style he had begun to develop with such films as The Lonely Villa.
A notable example was The Lonedale Operator (1911 ), one of the
most intricately edited of the one-reel films with ninety-eight sep-
arate shots. This film definitively laid out the distinction between
a scene, continuous action in one location, and a shot as a seg-
ment of a scene and of a shot chain that breaks up the scene into
numerous shots. A variation on The Lonely Villa theme (thugs
menace here not a bourgeois family but a working woman, a
rail-
road telegrapher), The Lonedale Operator displays a wider range
of analytical editing technique than any film before.
It cuts
rapidly among three or four separate locations, changes camera
position within scenes, and uses close-ups and inserts for narra-
tive information.
Griffith demonstrated his mastery of the one-reel format with
two films made back-to-back
in August-September 1912
The
Painted Lady, a psychological study, and The Musketeers of Pig
Alley, a crime melodrama. In the first film, Blanche Sweet
(1894-1986, the telegraph operator of The Lonedale Operator)
plays the prim, responsible elder daughter of a widower who
misses out on the playful
life of her younger sister. A man courts

her, only to betray her. When a burglar enters the house and she
accidentally shoots him, the victim turns out to be her "sweet-
heart." She becomes mentally unbalanced. Moving the camera
closer for more medium shots (less than a performer's full body,
generally from head to thigh or calf) and close-ups than was
typical, the film focuses on the woman's inner, emotional
life;
it
was one of the earliest to emphasize an actor's interpretation of
character, performance as well as plot.
Though a crime film, The Musketeers of Pig Alley was different
from the hundreds of earlier films that had depicted criminals as
alien invaders of bourgeois family
life.
It was set in the lower-class
ghetto which spawned crime, but where people (as the film
insists) also struggle to maintain respectable lives. Some scenes
were shot on the streets of New York City's Lower East Side
(location shooting had been common
in the primitive cinema,
when several long takes might comprise an entire film, but the
growing emphasis on performance and on multiple camera setups
made the controlled setting of the studio more suitable for the
emerging narrative style); studio sets were constructed to resem-
ble famous photographs by the reformer Jacob Riis of an
underworld hideout. The film features a tense gun battle in a back
alley, but
it also offers touches of character and comic relief for
which Griffith's dramas also became known. As a further display
of his versatility, soon after this Griffith directed a romantic com-
edy, The New York Haf (1912). This film was based on a
free-lance submission from a teen-age girl, Anita Loos, who later
became a Hollywood scriptwriter and wrote the book Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes.
FEATURE FILMS
The trouble was, by the end of 1912 being king of the one-reelers
no longer put you on top of the motion picture trade. While the
producers affiliated with the Motion Picture Patents Company,
such as Biograph, pursued a conservative policy, moving only
cautiously into two-reel films, others were undeterred by their
attempted monopoly. New companies stepped into the vacuum
with longer films. Their inspiration was the international success
of a nearly one-hour (four-reel) film made in France, Les Amours
de la Reine Elisabeth {Queen Elizabeth, 1912), starring the stage
legend Sarah Bernhardt. That
it looked back to the primitive cin-
ema in
its distant camera and tableau style did not impede this
film's popularity.
It carried the aura of its star attraction and the
"higher" art of theater and was more readily acknowledged as
aesthetically significant than, for example, the stylistics of a
Griffith one-reeler. (As early as 1907 a French production com-
pany called itself Film d'Art and offered works made with
performers and directors from the prestigious theater company the
Comedie Fran^aise.)
By 1914, in the United States alone, more than four hundred
feature films of four reels or more were produced by more than
one hundred companies. ("Feature" remains an ill-defined term,
pertaining to the principal attraction on a mixed program, rather
than to any agreed-upon minimum length; over time, however,
the norm for features tended to grow longer, going from less than
one hour in this era to ninety minutes or more.) The best of these
(on the evidence of the few that have survived) went far beyond
Queen Elizabeth in their capacity not only to incorporate but also
to advance the narrative style Griffith had pioneered.
55

3.2.

tion shot from Griffith's The
Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912)
The Wishing Ring
A prime example was The Wishing Ring (1914), written and
directed in the United States by the French filmmaker Maurice
Tourneur (1876-1961
). Because he knew English, Tourneur had
recently been sent by his French production company,
Eclair, to
make films at a studio they had opened
in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
The Wishing Ring (made not for Eclair but for a new American
company. World Film Corp.) pays homage to the theatrical origin
of its story and the prestige accorded filmed plays by enclosing
its
narrative within a theater curtain that opens when the film begins
and closes at the end.
In between, however, the mise-en-scene
develops a sense of cinematic space, based on the shot, rather
than the theatrical space of a film like Queen Elizabeth. This light-
hearted "Idyll of Old England," as
it
is subtitled, utilizes the range
of analytical editing techniques articulated by Griffith — cross-
cutting, changes of shot within a scene,
inserts, and close-ups.
What marks
it further
is a complex use of deep space:
in contrast
to the flat, enclosing rear walls of most studio sets, or action
in
only one spatial area
in outdoor locations, the film's action can
be observed in several planes of space receding from the camera.
Contrasts between different spatial areas are enhanced by the use
of light emanating from sources within the screen image (rather

slowly revealing the entire cast assembled to celebrate the wed-
ding of the romantic leads.
A Volatile Era
The period from 1910 to 1920 was among the most varied and
volatile in film history. While the major transformations in film
style that have captured the attention of scholars were proceeding
at a rapid pace, out of the spotlight the landscape of cinema
changed much more slowly. Though exhibitors began charging
premium prices for special bookings of big new feature films (in
1990s terms, more like the cost of an opera ticket than a movie
ticket), the five- and ten-cent theaters were still the places where
most people saw films. What was shown in those theaters contin-
ued to be mainly one- and two-reelers, and comedies remained
highly popular. Even as new narrative styles took root,
first in the
United States, then more and more internationally, a great many
filmmakers still were content to work
in the older presentational
style, with
little interest in exploring the possibilities of shot
changes, camera movement, or close-ups.
oiind '4 y^)iknts
Silent films were rarely soundless. Often
considerable eft'ort went into preparing
musical scores, sound effects, narrations,
or even spoken dialogue to be performed
at the exhibition site of films that lacked
recorded sound. This
is invariably a sur-
prising discovery to later generations who
are accustomed to seeing silent films
played silently in classrooms or museums,
or to hearing a nostalgic tinkly piano
score accompanying television screenings
of silent comedy classics. By comparison,
as a perhaps unusual example, some
early cinema audiences heard an original
score by the noted symphonic and opera
composer Charles Camille Saint-Saens
(1835-1921
1, commissioned by the
French company Film d'Art to be per-
formed with
its 1908 film L'Assassinat du
Due de Guise
( The Assassination of the
Due de Guise).
A historian of silent film music, Martin
Marks, has analyzed scores written as
early as 1895-96 for the Bioscop presen-
tations of Emil and Max Skladanovvsky in
Germany. But a principal focus of activity
around sound accompaniment to silent
films came in 1908-10, years that saw
the beginning of a transition from the
"primitive" modes of early cinema to new
narrative styles. A dominant concern of
the time was how much explanation and
interpretation the screen images needed.
Lecturers flourished in this period, and
film historian Charles Musser, in a study
of traveling exhibitors prepared in collab-
oration with Carol Nelson, discovered
numerous instances of performers deliver-
ing dialogue and sound effects from
behind the screen. "Humanova Talking
Pictures" was the name of one company
of traveling performers.
The development of new narrative
styles, which included increasing use of
intertitles and visual narrative explanation
through analytical editing, sharply cur-
tailed the roles of lecturers and live
performers. Music, however, became
even more important to motion picture
presentation. In 1910 the American trade
paper Moving Picture World began a col-
umn "Music for the Picture," and by 1912
a production company, Kalem, was offer-
ing to exhibitors lat twentv-five cents a
copyt special piano scores for its releases,
composed by a pianist, Walter Cleveland
Simon (1884-1958). A landmark in film
music was the orchestral score composed
and selected by Joseph Carl Breil for
D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation
(1915), which contributed significantly
to the film's success.
At the same time, inventors in the
United States and Europe were working
on recorded sound for motion pictures.
One system was Thomas A. Edison's
Kinetophone, which harked back to his
ideas of a quarter century earlier for link-
ing the phonograph and motion pictures.
Edison's company made a number of
films in 1913-14 with sound recorded on
phonograph records that were connected
to a projector and a sound amplifier in
theaters. Other systems were developed
and exhibited in France, Germany, and
Britain before World War
I. Problems with
synchronization and amplification were
not satisfactorily solved until the 1920s
(see Chapter 8).

Despite
its importance, this decade
is also the era of film his-
tory about which least
is known. Only a small handful of films by
the best-known directors are in wide circulation, and archival col-
lections are only beginning to be systematically viewed and
evaluated.
It
is possible that directors and films from Brazil or
India or Japan, from the Scandinavian countries or Germany or
Russia, even from the dominant cinemas of France or Italy or the
United States— known now,
if at all, only to a few specialists
will take their place alongside the prominent figures discussed
here. The materials for a full picture of the "teens" decade are
still
to be gathered.
EPIC FILMS
There are films that make their presence felt before they are seen.
One of the earliest was Cabiria (1914), directed by Giovanni
Pastrone for the Itala company of Turin. News of its epic form,
enormous length— its original version
is listed variously at 4,000
meters or eighteen reels, which would make at least three hours
of running time, though later versions were cut by a third— and
massive sets preceded
its actual arrival
in many countries, shaking
the foundations of world cinema like the volcanic eruption of
Mount Etna the film depicts. The Italian cinema had already made
a significant impact in the international market with epic-style
films on historical, biblical, and mythological subjects. The most
successful thus far had been Quo Vadis? (]9]3), directed by Enrico
Guazzoni (1876-1949), based on Henryk Sienkiewicz's 1896
novel about Christians and pagans in imperial Rome during the
first century a.d. Operatic
in
its grandeur, Cabiria was nearly
twice the length of Quo VacZ/si' (released at 2,250 meters).
It
united spectacle and narrative in a manner that has made a per-
manent mark on film style and practices.
Cahiria
The story of Cabiria
is perhaps of less moment to a later era than
to its original audience. (An Italian literary hero of the time, sol-
dier and poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, was hired to write the
intertitles; historians dispute how much work he actually did, but

the tact that he lent his name to the project was of immeasurable
importance to
its prestige and success.)
It
is set in the period of
the Roman Republic, around the third century b.c, when Rome
was engaged
in wars with another city-state, Carthage, located in
North Africa near the present city of Tunis,
in Tunisia. An aristo-
cratic Roman child, Cabiria,
is kidnapped and carried off to
Carthage; a Roman soldier, Fulvius Axilla, and his black slave
Maciste pursue her into the dark heart of the enemy's city; after
many years and innumerable harrowing adventures, they rescue
her. By that time Cabiria
is a beautiful grown-up woman, and she
and Fulvius Axilla have fallen in love.
The awesome splendor of its mise-en-scene
is what keeps
Cabiria remarkably fresh. The city of Carthage was destroyed in
the second century b.c, during the last of its wars with Rome, and
no visual renderings of
it survived; the film's designers were free
to create a space of fantasy and horror. The Carthaginian temple
to the god Moloch
is
its highlight.
Its entrance, approached by a
broad stairway dozens of feet in height,
is through the fanged
mouth of a three-eyed figure; inside
is another huge statue of a
god, a strange winged figure with an elephantine head and a roar-
ing fire in
its belly, into which young children are gruesomely
sacrificed.
Maciste (played by a Caucasian actor in light blackface make-
up) put his superhuman strength
in service to the Romans— and
to the Italian expansionist ideology of the period when the film
was made. Along with similar figures in Quo Vadis^ and a 1913
gladiator film, Spartaco (Spartacusj, Maciste launched a genre of
strongman films that lasted into the 1920s (thirteen titles began
with the character's name between 1915 and 1926) and resur-
faced
in the 1960s with a series again bearing the name of
Maciste. English-language versions called the hero Hercules,
Goliath, Colossus, Samson, Atlas, or simply The Strongest Man in
the World.
The Birth ofa Nation
Among those for whom Cabiria made the ground tremble was
D. W. Griffith. His ambition was to be recognized as the world's
greatest filmmaker; but the Italians were regularly raising the
stakes.
It was the arrival of Quo Vadis? in New York that prompted
him
in 1913 to go beyond Biograph's policy of one-reel films and
make two-reel films and his own biblical epic, Judith of Bethulia.
Merely hearing about Cabiria,
it was reported, led him to begin
planning his own big historical film,
Tine Birth of a Nation (1915),
and actually seeing the Italian work set him to an even more
grandiose project, the omni-historical Intolerance (1916).
The Birth of a Nation came only fifty years— not, as in Cabiria's
case, two millennia— after the events
it depicted.
Still, some back-
ground
is required to place the film in
its historical context. The
United States Civil War of 1861-65 between the northern and
southern states had numerous causes, but many of them stemmed
from the South's attempt to preserve the holding of African-
Americans as chattel slaves. Slavery was abolished in the South by
President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation during
the war, and the victorious North followed a policy of Reconstruc-
tion after the war in the defeated southern states, partly in an effort
to insure rights of citizenship for freed slaves. The Civil War and
Reconstruction were the subjects of Griffith's film. By the early
twentieth century, a new tide of racialism in the United States had
swept away the gains of Reconstruction, segregation between
whites and blacks had become a way of life in the South, and the-
orists of racial purity were advocating a reconciliation between
northern and southern whites who had formerly been enemies.
As a southerner living and working in the North and seeking
national approbation, Griffith chose to emphasize one particular
version of the reconciliation theme: that the southern secession
from the union deserved to be forgiven because southern whites
had demonstrated to northern whiles that their true enemies were
not each other, but the threat of dilution of their common race.
While proclaiming its fidelity to historical accuracy, Griffith's film
subsumes the issues of chattel slavery and the southern secession
within
its larger subject— that racial ec|uality places white women
in danger of sexual assault.
Reviewers in the United States were quick to hail The Birth of a
Nation as superior to Cabiria.
If the motion picture medium had
not yet proven
itself a major cultural force, the film's sweeping
depiction of significant events in United States history put the
matter to rest. The riveting sequence of the Ku Klux Klan's ride to
rescue white maidenhood had the forceful power to sweep the
spectator up at least temporarily into
its racist fantasy of fear and
redemption. However disturbing
its social implications, the

sequence marked the most spectacular instance of analytical edit-
ing yet constructed, with
its cascade of dozens of separate shots,
switching rapidly back and forth between the white woman
besieged by the sexual advances of a mulatto man and the gath-
ering of the white-hooded bands who ride to save her.
The Birth of a Nation was controversial from
its first screening.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP), a recently formed organization concerned with the
rights and development of African-Americans, organized a public
campaign against the film and sought unsuccessfully through legal
action to have
it banned. Even decades later the film often cannot
be screened without protests.
Its historical importance
is undeni-
able, but as the first great American epic
its legacy
is more
troubling than triumphant.
Intolerance
Griffith's Intolerance seems to have been shaped as much by his
resentment against the critics of The Birth of a Nation as by any
larger philosophical viewpoint. While he was working on a con-
temporary story of injustice in an urban ghetto much like the
setting of The Musketeers of Pig Alley (a humanitarian sensitivity
toward immigrants and white ethnic minorities stood in contrast
to his racial views), he decided to create an epic on the subject of
lack of tolerance toward others' beliefs by adding to the present-
day narrative further episodes on the persecution of Jesus, the
massacre of Protestant Huguenots in sixteenth-century France,
and obscure but colorful struggles in ancient Babylon. These four
separate narrative strands were intermingled, with the shift from
one to another signaled by a repeated shot of a woman rocking a
cradle.

Griffith had been spending the winter months since 1910 in the
Southern California community of Hollywood, where a number of
filmmakers had begun to work year-round; after leaving Biograph
he had relocated there for his first feature film work. For the
Babylonian sequence of Intolerance, he built in an open
Hollywood field a set that was his answer to the mammoth
Carthage sets of Cabiria. His Babylon made Moloch's temple in
the Italian film look puny by comparison; he borrowed the motif
of elephantine figures, but made them twice the size of Pastrone's
devouring god. The spectacle of licentiousness and carnage that
he staged on this set was justified, as
it were, by association with
the more pious and humane themes of the other three episodes.
Unlike The Birth of a Nation and the Italian epics. Intolerance
was a commercial failure. One reason audiences did not find
it
satisfactory, ironically, was that its structure challenged the narra-
tive conventions that Griffith more than anyone else had made
the norms of filmmaking practice and spectator expectation.
Cabiria and the Griffith epics profoundly influenced cultural
discourse about cinema, though their impact on the way films
were made was, at least in the short run, limited. The outbreak of
World War
I
in Europe in August 1914 cut off resources for film-
making, curtailing production generally and precluding any grand
projects. In the United States (which did not enter the war until
1917), the development of standard management and production
procedures in the film industry discouraged expensive, time-
consuming projects. The epics mainly affected how people talked

about film: cultural elites who had previously given scant atten-
tion to the medium could now appreciate
its artistic capabilities
in the framework of traditional "high" art forms such as opera,
theater, and symphonic music. While there were still holdouts
who deplored the movies primarily on moral grounds, with the
epics of the mid-teens most educated people throughout the
world accepted cinema not only as a sociological phenomenon
but as the newest form of art.
COMEDY
The vast majority of the world's peoples who had access to cin-
ema theaters did not go to the movies to debate aesthetics. They
went to have a good time. All sorts of films were created to feed
this appetite. As did other arts, cinema as
it developed organized
itself in categories or types of works, distinguished by style or sub-
ject, called genres. Reference works for this period have identified
at least two dozen different genres within the full range of film
production. Among these, a particular pride of place might be

its status as art, one- and two-reel comedies poured out

the laughter of the common filmgoer.
In the trick films, risque comedies, and chase films of the primi-
tive cinema, performers had been anon\ mous figures and the

Italy and became a star as the character Cretinetti, sometimes
translated as Foolshead, with a more slapstick st\ le of perfor-
mance than Linder—the term derived from the stick wielded b\
clowns in Punch-and-Jud\ pupp>et shows and denoted a boister-
ous, sometimes physically violent tvpe of comedy.
Mack Sennett
The slapstick comedv format was developed in the United States
by Mack Sennett
1 1884 -1960 1. a Canadian of Irish extraction,
bom in Quebec. Sennett had joined Biograph as an actor around
the same time as D. \V. Griffith and became an active if minor
member of Griffith's stable of performers. In 1909 he appeared in
more than one hundred Biograph films, usually as a figure in a
group or crowd; later he claimed to have written the script for The
Lonelv Villa, which, as we have seen, copied a Pathe film. Bv
1911
he was directing the half-reel comedies w hile Griffith concen-
trated on one-reel dramas. The next vear two entrepreneurs,
Adam Kessel and Charles Bauman, hired him as director at a new
comedv studio, Kev stone.
Sennett learned the analytical editing stv'ie from Griffith and
applied
it w ith a vengeance. Though he emploved comic person-

rapid cutting, so fast at times that indiv idual shots passed in a

cinema to this breakneck editing st\ le, and exaggerated both to
the point of parodv. One constant was a failure to be solemn

tribute to the working-class audiences who were so important to
the rapid development of cinema in the United States, yet they
have often been described as having universal appeal across lines
of nationality and social class. Chaplin's reputation has gone
through ups and down over the decades. His films have been
criticized for sentimentality and for lacking advanced cinematic
techniques.
Still, his worldwide success was a phenomenon few
other artists have ever attained.
Middle-Class Comedy
Bourgeois comedy was also highly popular in the United States,
reflecting perhaps the growing predominance of spectators from
the middle classes. Vitagraph produced scores of domestic come-
dies, many with the portly comedian John Bunny (1863-19151.
Alice Guy Blache's A House Divided (^9'^3), produced for her
Solax company, was a typical example of the genre: a husband
comes home smelling from the perfume a salesman has tried to
sell to his secretary; the angry wife, after consulting a lawyer,
communicates with her husband onlv bv handwritten note; the
6«

misunderstanding
is solved and they reconcile. This film
is distin-
guished by vivacious performances by wife and secretary, the
latter a gum-chewing snip.
A performer who brought a particularly youthful slant to bour-
geois comedv was Douglas Fairbanks,
Sr. (1883-1939), who
became a highly popular figure in more than two dozen feature
comedies between 1915 and 1919 before turning to costume epics
in the 1920s. Fairbanks was more than a performer, writing (or
signing his name toi self-help books with titles like Laugh and
Live (1917) which stressed developing moral character and physi-
cal strength. His screen persona was a figure who found himself
in comic situations that also addressed the serious question, what
does
it take to be a man? This was often posed in the framework
of a contrast between the constraints of citv
life as compared to
wide-open frontiers.
In the comedy Wild and lVoo//>'ll917), for
example, Fairbanks portrays a seemingly spoiled and effete rich
boy who goes to the West and through imagination and physical
strength proves his worth as a man.

Animation
Another important aspect of screen comedy after 1910 was the
animated film. These films simulated motion through stop-action
photography: each frame was photographed separately, with
imperceptible shifts of position in the image that, when projected,
appeared as movement. An eady form of animation, popular
beginning around 1906, went by the name of "Lightning
Sketches," with cartoonists presenting for the camera exhibitions
of rapid drawing that they gave as live performances. Another
animation style utilized dolls or puppets: the most remarkable
examples in early cinema were the work of Russian animator
Wladyslaw Aleksandrowicz Starewicz (1882-1965). His most
famous film was Mest' kinematograficheskogo operatora {The
Cameraman's Revenge, 1912). The film concerns the infidelities of
Mr. and Mrs. Beetle, one with a dragonfly, the other with a
cricket,
all observed and documented by a grasshopper cinema-
tographer. When the beetles see themselves on screen at an
outdoor cinema, they brawl, and the projector goes up in flames.
The emerging form of animation after 1910, however, involved
frame drawings, individual drawings photographed one frame at a
time. Sometimes these were combined with other animation
forms, as in the films of ^mile Cohl (1857-1938) in France, which
sometimes mingled drawings, puppets, and live action, either
through shots of the artist's hand or scenes showing performers
and animation together through the matte process of printing sep-
arate negatives onto a single positive frame. Cohl's Le Retapeur
de cervelles (Brains Repaired, 1911
) was a film of continual
figure transformations that, like primitive cinema style, found an
echo in later avant-garde animations. Winsor McCay (1871-1934),
an American newspaper cartoonist well-known for comic-strip
series such as "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend" and "Little Nemo
in Slumberland," created an animated Little Nemo ior Vita-
graph in 1911 (another example of cinema's intertextual relation
with comic strips, noted as early as the Lumieres' Arroseur et
arrose). McCay developed his work through the decade with
such films as Gertie (1914), featuring a dinosaur, and The Sinking
of the Lusitania (1918), a kind of animated "actualitv" film con-
cerning a German submarine's sinking of a passenger ship in
1915.
STARS
The success of the comedy genre, and in particular Charlie
Chaplin's rapid rise to international fame, highlighted the basic
underpinnings of cinema as the medium increasingly took on an
industrial character after 1910. The organization of film compa-
nies into larger, more complex units went together with exhibition
practices and audience expectation and desires to establish a pro-
duction system based upon repetition and familiarit\— in other

words, genres and stars. Genres had been part of moviemaking
since the days of Edison's Black Maria;
it was only with the emer-
gence of the new narrative style— which began to emphasize
emotional identification with performers/characters on screen
that stars became a factor in the medium.
Once film producers began to employ stock companies of
performers who appeared frequently in one-reel releases—and
played them close enough to the camera so they became recog-
nizable personalities— spectators expressed preferences for their
favorites. Exhibitors discovered that they could attract audiences
by publicizing the name or face of a popular performer and began
to press producers for promotional materials. Vitagraph players
early in 1910 started making personal appearances at theaters
near their Brooklyn studio. Trade publications began running sec-
tions on "picture personalities," and fan magazines appeared in
1911, beginning with Motion Picture Story Magazine and
Photoplay. There were precedents for star status in other
performance-based arts, but live performers could be in only
one place, while film performers could be seen on many screens
simultaneously.
Female Stars
The mystery of stardom
is that no single variable—beauty, perfor-
mance style, or promotional effort— can predict or determine
public response. Historical accounts of the "first" stars tend actu-
ally to be concerned with the first promotions of stars. Florence
Lawrence (1888-1938), who was known as the Biograph Girl at a
time when that company did not publicize
its players, became
the subject of a promotional campaign
in 1910 when the IMP
(Independent Motion Picture) company hired her away. Vitagraph
countered that same year by promoting Florence Turner (1885-
1946) as the Vitagraph Girl, and these two campaigns have been
credited as the emergence of the star system. But the careers of
both women were short-lived, compared with that of Mary
Pickford (1893-1979), a Canadian who got her start with Griffith
at Biograph and became the most important female star in the
United States with a radiant, youthful style; or of the Italian diva
Francesta Bertini 11888-1985), a dark, fiery Neapolitan who
attained international stardom in such films as the realist drama
Assunta Spina (1915), directed by Gustavo Serena.

The most notorious instance of star promotion of the era
involved a performer named Theda Bara (1890-1955). William
Fox (1879-1952), an exhibitor and distributor launching the Fox
Film Corp. (which would later be merged into Twentieth Century-
Fox), concocted the name for Ohio-born actress Theodosia
Goodman;
its anagram turned out to be "Arab Death," and fanci-
ful tales were told of her exotic origins as daughter of a sheik.
Extensive promotion of Bara as a "vampire" whose seductions
men could not resist preceded release of her first film, A Fool
There Was (1915), whose narrative seemed to confirm the pub-
licity. She popularized the word vamp and made nearly forty films
between 1915 and 1919 before her vogue waned.
Male Stars
By mid-decade a handful of stars had become major attractions
and were commanding extraordinary salaries in keeping with their
importance to a film's success. The comics Linder and Chaplin
were near the head of the
list
(it was perhaps significant that as
directors they had greater control over their screen images, but
audiences knew them only as performers). Besides these comic
personalities and others like Fairbanks, however, few male per-

formers attained star status in this early period— at least few
whose reputation and aura have survived the years. One was
Bartolomeo Pagano (1878-1947), Maciste of Cabiria, who
re-created the popular role at least half a dozen times before 1920;
in /Vljc/sfe ci/p/no (1916), produced by Pastrone, the "friendly
giant" was transmigrated from a black slave to an Italian soldier
fighting on the Austrian front. Another was a cowboy star
spawned by the Western genre in the United States, William
S.
Hart (1862-1946). He was the prototype of the "good-bad man," a
lean, stern loner who values his independence more than
his rep-
utation but always ends up fighting on the side of justice. Hart
also directed most of his films;
in
/Vr//'s Hinges (1916), he created
a remarkable portrait of a corrupt frontier town through which he
stalks, guns bla/ing, until the place
is consumed for
its sins in a
spec tac ular fire.
For nearly
all these figures, especially the men, stardom and
screen character were fused. Basically their screen personas and
roles were the same from picture to picture, unlike many stars of
later eras who played a variety of roles
in difterent genres. One
reason for the difference may
lie in the fact that seriality of screen
character was at
its height in the 1910-20 period.
SERIES AND SERIALS
Seriality occurred through both series— feature-length films that
recounted the adventures of a continuing character— and serials,
one- or two-reel films released on a weekly basis, which often
ended
in moments of crisis and imminent death that would be
resolved only
in the next installment. The most famous series con-
cerned an arch-criminal, Fantomas, who stymies the police in five
four-reel French films made in 1913 and 1914. Director Louis
Feuillade (1873-1925) used a distant camera and static shots to
create a contemplative viewpoint on his urban setting, rather than
spectator involvement with individuals. Perhaps because of this
visual style, though the series gained enormous popularity in
many countries,
it did not achieve international stardom for Rene
Navarre, the actor who played Fantomas. Feuillade went on to
make a ten-part series, Les Vampires,
in 1915-16 and others later
in the decade.
Many of the weekly serials featured women as protagonists.
The one that gained lasting fame was The Perils of Pauline (1914),

Pathe produced this and other serials starring White in the United

It
combined parts of The Perils of Pauline with other White serials
to make a new hybrid for French release, called Les Mysteres de
New-York, that created a sensation
in France in 1915. Later critics
have argued over whether spectators were more enthralled by
White's screen triumphs or her tribulations.
FILM AND WORLD WAR
I
while
it changed the course of history. World War
I also deeply
influenced the development of cinema. Above all,
it affected the
film industries of Europe, several of which had been among the
world leaders in the first two decades of the medium. When war
broke out in August 1914, film activity in France simpiv stopped.
Movie theaters closed, actors and technicians left the studios for
the front. None of the other belligerents reacted in such a drastic
way—and in
Italy, which did not enter the war until April 1915,
production briefly boomed. As the war dragged on longer than
had been expected, filmmaking resumed in France. But overall, as
combat continued until 1918, European film industries increas-
ingly felt the effect of lost personnel,
lost resources,
lost markets.
United States Exyatision
In the United States, which sta\ed out of the war until April
1917,
filmmakers were in a position to take advantage of their competi-
tors' distractions. The industry had changed radically since 1908,
when the Motion Picture Patents Company had been formed to
limit the number of producers, distributors, and exhibitors to
Edison licensees (see Chapter 2i. This effort had completely failed.
Firms excluded from the Edison group continued to make films,
and independent production, distribution, and exhibition com-
panies managed not onK
to survive but to gain strength
in the
years when feature-length filmmaking became more common. In
1912 the United States government brought a suit against the
Patents Company as a monopoly in violation of antitrust laws,
and in October 1915 a federal court decision ordered the com-
pany dissolved.
In the eady part of the decade hundreds of companies had
entered the motion picture business, but by 1916 new forms of
concentration were beginning to take shape. A few companies
from the ranks of the independents were emerging as leaders.
One was formed in a merger that year among two production
companies, Famous Plavers and the Jesse
L. Laskv company, and
a distributor. Paramount. Adoiph Zukor
1 1873-1976) became pres-
ident of the new firm, called Famous Players-Lasky, but the name
Paramount was retained and eventually became the company
name. Another, Universal, united a number of smaller companies
under Cad Laemmie (1867-1939). William Fox's Fox Film Corp.
was a third. Zukor, Laemmie, and Fox had all come into the
motion picture field as exhibitors or distributors. Zukor and Fox in
particular recognized a need to gain ownership of all three ele-

mcnts of the motion picture business— production, exc h.inges,
and theaters— in order to insure a steady flow of films through a
vertically integrated operation.
With war disrupting European production, particularly in the
powerful French film industry, American producers went after
markets in Asia, Australia, and Latin America.
In Europe, too, they
made inroads. The war was a crisis for European civilization;
it
shattered ideals and empires, fostered revolutions,
left cultures
in
shambles. American movies— the comedies of Sennett and
Chaplin, the serials, the Westerns— with their sense of space,
movement, and action, seemed to many a relief from the tragedies
and disappointments of war. Some deplored the violence and
anarchic humor of American movies as further evidence of
civilization's downfall, but they were not among the mass of
moviegoers. By 1918 the United States had emerged as the world
leader of cinema, and
it widened the gap with production
values— elaborate sets and expensive costumes— that European
cinemas could no longer afford.
Expansion produced in the United States a form of industrial
filmmaking that was far removed from Edwin S. Porter's methods
only a few years earlier.
It came to be known as a "producer" sys-
r
j-ixf^ressiomsm
Of all the early-twentieth-century art
movements, the one most closely associ-
ated with cinema,
at least in name,
is
expressionism— and in film as in the arts,
the term
is usually given a national defini-
tion, "German Expressionism." Clearly
the link between expressionism and
C^erman cinema
is an important one: for
one thing,
it helped to give status to
German films after World War
I as
distinctive works of art. But where expres-
sionism
is concerned, neither terminology
nor chronology
is undisputed.
"To try to define Expressionism
is a
thankless task," cultural historian Walter
l.aqueur has written, "given the inchoate
( haracter of the movement." Many critics
have found
it easier to characterize
expressionism not by what
it was but by
what
it was against; naturalism, efforts to
depict reality, the idea that there were
artistic forms through which the "real"
could be represented. The expressionists
were part of pre-World War
I intellectual
ferment, a rebellion against the values of
I uropean bourgeois soc iety of the late
nineteenth century. They believed that art
derived from inner vision rather than from
impressions of a real world or from con-
ventions of artistic practice.
In the visual arts, expressionism began
in Germany around 1905-6 and flour-
ished
in the period 1911-14 with a group
of artists in Munich known as Der Blaue
Reiter ("The Blue Rider"). Among
its lead-
ing figures were the Russian painter
Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944), the
Swiss painter Paul Klee (1879-1940), and
the German painter Franz Marc (1880-
1916), who was killed
in action during
World War
I.
In their 1912 book Der
Blaue Reiter, Kandinsky and Marc
asserted their movement's affinity with
"primitive" art and the necessity of
breaking with artistic traditions. Their
own work in paintings and lithographs
was generally abstract and non-
representational.
Expressionism was also a literary move-
ment, particularly in poetry and theater.
In her book on expressionism
in German
cinema, The Haunted Screen, Lotte
Eisner describes an expressionist play of
1912 as one in which "Mind,
Spirit,
Vision, and Ghosts seem to gush forth,
exterior facts are continually being trans-
formed into interior elements and psychic
events are exteriorized." These same traits
she finds in German films of the World
War
I period and the Weimar era.
Many critics have seen expressionism
in the arts as ending in 1914 with the out-
break of war. From this perspective, the
expressionist mise-en-scene of The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari has been regarded
as contrived and commercial, a calcu-
lated means to attract attention by
novelty. A new viewpoint argues that in
1914-25 there emerged a second genera-
tion of expressionist artists,
still seeking to
express inner vision but more didactic
and political. In any case, only a handful
of films after Caligari followed
its style of
abstract, nonrealist set design; but the
film's contemporary importance was the
attention
it secured to German film under
the rubric of "expressionist art."

tern— so named because the person
in charge was a business
manager who supervised ail aspects of a film's development. This
person acquired story properties, approved scripts, established
budgets, hired creative personnel, approved casting, maintained
shooting schedules, oversaw the director's work, and had final say
over editing and other postproduction work. New creative
responsibilities marked a further division of labor: to the behind-
the-camera jobs of scriptw riter, cinematographer, director, and
editor were added important new roles for costume and set
designers lalso called art directors), who supplied those produc-
tion values that enhanced American films.
Art Direction
A former New York theatrical designer, Wilfred Buckland
(1866-1946), was perhaps the first to receive onscreen credit for
art direction. Director Cecil B. DeMille (1881-1959) hired him to
work on films such as The Girl of the Golden West and The Cheat
(both 1915). Buckland worked closely with DeMille and his cine-
matographer in decisions about lighting, camera angles, and
placement of actors in designing the overall look of a film. Stung
by elite critics who delighted
in attacking motion picture design
for historical inaccuracies and other slips, the American designers
strove for artistry within a realist stvle. The Italian cinema for a
time was more experimental; the director Anton Giulio Bragaglia
(1889-1960) incorporated styles from the contemporary futurist
art movement into set designs for his Thais (1917) and Perfido
incanto
( Wicked Enchantment, 1918).
Danish Film
The war had an impact even on countries that stayed out of
it.
The Nordisk company of Denmark, with
its logo of a white polar
bear astride the globe, was, before 1914, next to Pathe the world's
second largest film producer. Danish films were popular in Russia,
Germany, western Europe, and the United States, where Nordisk's
branch was called the Great Northern film company. Denmark's
neutrality did not protect Nordisk from the effects of war. Perhaps
because the company owned theaters in Germany,
its films were
banned
in France and Russia, and then the Germans took over
the theaters. Nordisk and Danish film never recovered.
Out of this debacle, however, emerged one of the most impor-
tant film directors of the century. A scriptwriter, Carl Th. Dreyer
(1889-1968), got a chance to direct for Nordisk when others left
the declining company. His second film. Blade afSatans bog
{Leaves from Satan's Book, 1919, released 1921
), was indebted to
Intolerance. Like Griffith's film
it had four episodes, three histori-
cal and one contemporary, but Dreyer's came one after another,
rather than interspersed.
Its dark theme
is that Satan
is doomed to
do evil through the ages— first, also as with Griffith,
in the
betrayal of Jesus; then
in the Spanish Inquisition;
in the French
Revolution; and
in the postwar struggle between Reds and Whites
in Finland. Despairing and nihilistic (Satan appears in both
reli-
gious and revolutionary guisel, Dreyer's film displays a mastery of
the screen image, using architectural space and studies of the
human face in ways rarelv before seen
in the cinema.
Postwar German Film
Cinema was also profoundly affected, unsurprisingly, in countries
where political upheaval was the greatest.
In Germany, after polit-
ical turmoil and attempted revolution, a republic was founded
in
1919 in Weimar. During the war, the German government played
a stronger role in film than elsewhere.
It launched a production
company, Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft (Ufa), which went
private under banking control after the war.
After the war, because of the hostility to German cultural prod-
ucts in the victorious allied nations, German filmmakers sought
subjects or styles of such compelling interest that ;hey would
overcome resistance in the export market. One apprrjach was the
sensational costume drama concerning the histories of allied
countries:
if the costumes (or the removing of themj did not
impress, then the behind-the-curtains representations of historical
personages would capture attention. Two such works were
Madame Dubarry (^9^9), concerned with France, and Anna
Boleyn (1920), with England, both directed by Ernst Lubitsch
3.40.

(1892-1947), who gained such international prominence from
them that he was invited to Hollywood to direct a picture for
Mary Pickford; he came, and stayed.
Expressionism
A second approach was the controversial application of avant-
garde aesthetic styles in commercial films. The classic instance
was the expressionist film Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (The
Cabinet of Dr Caligari, 1919), directed by Robert Wiene (1881-
1938). Expressionism was an artistic movement in painting,
theater, and literature. A revolt against naturalism,
it emphasized
the inner vision and personal emotional feelings of the artist. In
theater and also in cinema,
it took the form of abstract set design
and a highlv psychologized narrative. The script for Caligari by
Carl Mayer (1894-1944) and Hans Janowitz was about a mysteri-
ous doctor, Caligari, who displays a somnambulist, Cesare, at
sideshows; Cesare rises at night to murder the doctor's enemies
and rivals. During production a frame structure was created so
that the original narrative became a tale told by an inmate at an
insane asvlum—the doctor,
it turns out, was the head of the asy-
lum, the somnambulist a patient, the murders perhaps a figment
of an insane person's imagination. Or perhaps not.

The designers, Hermann Warm (1889-1976), Walter Rohrig
(1897-1945), and Walter Reimann, were instructed, as one later
put
it, to make the sets as eccentric as possible. They created
grotesquely distorted spaces, tilting houses, misshapen furniture.
Caligari remains an important and widely debated film, both for
its stylistic innovations and tor
its provocative and ambiguous
treatment of the relationships among authority, madness, and
violence.
78

War had transformed the world of cinema. A decade that began
with the first challenges to primitive cinema, and saw in
its mid-
dle vears a decisive shift to feature-length films, ended with new
industrial structures and aesthetic ambitions in place. The United
States was ready to assert its hegemony over world film distribu-
tion; European film industries were seeking artistic forms that
could compete with American commercial products; and other
regions and nations were struggling to establish or defend their
own film cultures in the face of the formidable dominance of the
major film producing countries.

FILMMAKING OUTSIDE
EUROPE AND THE
UNITED STATES
Brazil
Among the most exemplary instances of cinematic practice out-
side Europe and North America
is the early history of filmmaking
in Brazil. Some historians have called the years between 1908
and 191
1
Brazilian cinema's Beb Epoca, or Golden Age. Around
1907, as in the Northern Hemisphere, Brazil experienced an
expansion in movie theaters, followed by local production of
actuality films, a few fiction films, and a unique genre called
/'/'fas
cantatas—singing films. These were movies of operettas and
stage musicals, projected with live singers behind the screen
attempting to lip-synch the filmed performances. They accounted
for about 25 percent of Brazilian production in 1908-10, out-
numbering fiction films, while actuality films made up the
majority.
Changes in distribution methods doomed this brief burst of
Brazilian production. Pathe's earlier shift from selling to renting
its film prints began to affect the Brazilian market around 191 1.
Since European or United States films would have already earned
the bulk of their income in their home countries, foreign produc-
gaucha {Caucho Nobility), directed by Eduardo Marti'nez de la
Pera, Ernesto Cunch, and Humberto Cairo. This epic about the
cowboys of the Argentine pampas was exported throughout the
Hispanic world. Feature-length films were produced in almost all
the Latin American countries during the period, while in Mexico
a famous twelve-part serial. El automovil gris
i The day Car,
1919), directed by Enrique Rosas, Joaquin Coss, and Juan Canals
de Homes, was a dramatization based on actual events—holdups
by a gang driving gray automobiles—similar to contemporary
television docudramas.
]apan
In Japan—which had been opened to the West only in the 1860s
after nearly three centuries of isolation—a clear distinction
between Japanese tradition and Western cultural importations
ensured that Japanese film production would not be stifled, no
matter how many films were brought in from abroad. In the
1910-20 period Japanese films remained strongly tied to theater.
One genre consisted of filmed plays with live performers deliver-
ing the dialogue from behind the screen—something like the
Brazilian
fitas cantatas. Another was the "chain drama," so called
because
it interspersed, like links in a chain, scenes of live the-
atrical performance with filmed segments shot on location, or
involving spectacle elements too elaborate for the stage.
READ OF FILM
ers could lower their rental prices in Brazil below what Brazilian
producers needed to charge local exhibitors in order to recover
their costs. Given the choice of supporting domestic production
or earning higher profits, Brazilian distributors and theater opera-
tors opted for the latter, and argued in justification that overseas
films were superior to those produced in Brazil. Domestic prod-
uct was relegated to a minuscule position in
its own home
market.
By 1913, when Brazilians went to the movies, their opportuni-
ties to see a Brazilian film were infrequent. That year, French and
Italian films equally dominated Brazilian screens.
In 1915, when
French imports disappeared because of a curtailment of produc-
tion at the beginning of World War
I, Italian films increased their
share of the Brazilian market to two-thirds. Then when Italy
entered the war. United States films took over top position in
Brazil, accounting for two-thirds of imported films by 1920, and
their domination grew throughout the 1920s. These develop-
ments in Brazil set a pattern for many countries.
Latin America
There were in fact several so-called golden ages in early Latin
American cinema, most of them coming later than Brazil's,
in
that brief window from
1 91 5 to
1 920 when European film was
weakened but before the big postwar export surge from United
States production companies. In 1915 Argentina produced
among the most popular Latin American silent films, Nobleza
4.1. A scene from the popular
Argentine film Nobleza gaucha
iGaucho Nobility,
1915). an
epic about the cowboys of
Argentina s pampas
Late in the decade a debate developed over introducing a
"new style" of Japanese cinema production utilizing the new nar-
rative styles of American cinema and stories from contemporary
life. One of the points of difference concerned the all-male casts
from traditional Japanese theater. The figure of the oyama (a man
playing a woman's role) was carried over into the cinema, and
it
was a radical departure when women first appeared in Japanese
films in the early 1920s.

Colonialism
A glance at a historical atlas from 1914 would show that much of
the remainder of the world's territories was the colonial posses-
sion of European nations. The effect on the development of film
production under this circumstance was double-edged: on the
one hand, the flow of cultural products from the metropolitan
center was welcomed by colonial elites; on the other, these
works were not likely to represent indigenous cultural values, the
lack of which might create opportunities for local entrepreneurs.
INDIA.
This was the case in India, at that time part of the
British Empire, where one man apparently single-handedly
launched film production
in the country. The story
is told that
Dadasaheb Phaike
(1 870-1 944), executive of an art printing
company, saw a film about the life of Christ and determined that
a film should be made about the Hindi deity Lord Krishna. He
traveled to England for equipment and instruction, met there with
Cecil Hepworth, producer of Rescued by Rover, and returned in
1912 with camera, darkroom equipment, and film stock. For his
first film he chose a story from the popular legend the
Mahabharata, and in 1913 he released a feature-length film run-
ning nearly an hour. Raja Harishchandra (King Harishchandra).
No prints of this film have survived, and later historians have
been unable to describe
it, but segments were discovered that
Phaike had apparently saved for a planned compilation film, and
frame enlargements from these provide a sense of the film's
mythic mise-en-scene. Phaike made many more films and often
carried them as an exhibitor into the countryside. These works

In Europe and the United States the
development of cinema production was
multiple and simultaneous—a number of
figures were working independently at
the same time. In other parts of the
world, where filmmaking began a
decade or more after the first film
screenings,
its emergence can often be
pinpointed precisely to a specific group
or individual. Probably in no other
country' has the founder's mantle been so
unequivocally bestowed as in India,
where film historians honor Dadasaheb
Phaike as "Father of Indian Cinema."
What does
it take to become the patri-
arch of a nation's cinema? Phaike was a
forty-year-old businessman when he
went to a film that changed his
life.
"While the Life of Christ was rolling fast
before my physical eyes," he wrote a few
years later,
"I was mentally visualising
the Cods, Shri Krishna, Shri
Ramchandra, their Gokul and Ayodhya.

shape on the screen. Could this really
happen? Could we, the sois oi India,
ever be able to see Indian images on the
screen?"
Phalke's desire to make an Indian film
became an obsession. He borrcjwed
money to make the trip to England to
buy equipment and learn how to make
films; returning with a camera, a printing
machine, a perforator, and raw film
stock, he made a short test film with his
family and used
it to gain financing for
the feature-length film. Raja Harishchan-
dra [King Harishchandra), he wished to
make. Placing an advertisement in a
Bombay newspaper, "Handsome Faces
Wanted for Films," he found a lew stage
players, but no suitable female perform-
ers answered his call. Though he wanted
women to play female roles, he reverted
to the traditional Indian stage practice of
male actors performing the female part.'
(see fig. 4.6).
"I had to do everything," Phaike said
later.
"I had to teach acting.
I had to
write the scenario, do the photography
and actual projection too. Nobody knew
anything in India about the industry in
1 91
1 ." Shooting in the day, doing lab
work and editing in the evenings, Phaike
completed the film in six months.
Released in 1913,
it was a major suc-
cess.
"I am proud to say that
if
I had not
possessed the artistic and technical fac-
ulties required for film-making and
if
I
had not the courage and daring," he
wrote near the end of his
life, "the film
industry would never have been estab-
lished in India in 1912."
Between 1913 and 1931 Phaike
directed more than one hundred silent
feature films; during the 1930s he made
two sound features before retiring. A few
years later, when a magazine wrote him
requesting information, he replied, "The
industry to which
I gave birth has forgot-
I
ten me." Whether he was right in this
assessment, film historians in India have
restored his claim as the founder of
Indian film.

tries in the big cities. They also were exported to overseas Indian
populations in Singapore and East Africa, and were the precursors
of an indigenous Indian cinema that became after World War
I!
the world leader in total film production.
AUSTRALIA.
In 1900 8 British commonwealth with a popula-
tion predominantly of British origin, Australia as early as 1906
produced a feature-length fiction film, running more than an
hour: The Story of the Kelly Gang, directed by Charles Tait. This
narrative, based on actual events, inaugurated a genre of
"bushranger" films, similar to films about western outlaws in the
United States. As in Brazil, production peaked around 1911, and
began to fall off for somewhat the same reasons: a group of com-
panies came together to dominate distribution and exhibition and
had
little interest in promoting or showing locally made films.
Matters were made worse in 1912 when the police banned
"bushranger" films as harmful to children.
CHINA.
In China, film production was largely in the hands of
western entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, a British possession, and
the treaty port of Shanghai, where European commerce domi-
nated. A firm owned by Americans, the Asia Company, recorded
scenes of military struggle in 1912
in Shanghai,
in the aftermath
of the Manchu dynasty's abdication, and released a film, Shang
hai zhan zheng (War in Shanghai, 1912). The same company pro-
duced a fiction film in
1 91 3, Nan fu nan qi {The Difficult Couple),
with Chinese directors, Zhang Shichuan
(1 889-1 953) and Zheng

(1 888-1 935). In 1916 Zhang set up his own Chinese
company, Huanxian, the first in Shanghai, and produced Hei ai

yuan hun (Wrong Ghosts in an Opium Den), filmed by an Italian
cinematographer who had been in China for a decade shooting
travel films. The Italian owned the camera.
This review of filmmaking in half a dozen countries outside
Europe and North America—a summary' of the principal indus-
tries and efforts—suggests that the notion of a universal medium
reflected at least the reality of an international medium. Film-
makers traveled, from the West to elsewhere and from elsewhere
to the West; films traveled, though more in a one-wav flow. The
question of what was "national
" about films made within the bor-
ders of a country was complicated by the fact that ownership of
production companies and theaters, as well as key creative per-
sonnel, frequently came from other countries and "national"
cultures. What was certain was that the dominance first of Euro-
pean then of United States films in the world market forced a
dialogue on filmmakers in other countries: Should we make films
just like theirs, or be different? How do we find our own voice in
the cinema?
THROUGH WESTERN EYES
An even more serious flaw in the idea of cinema as a universal
language emerges from the fact of domination by Europe and the
United States. All countries and peoples could see films from
western countries, but when the\ appeared as subjects in those
films they were seen, perhaps inevitablv, through western eyes.
If
the western film industries aspired to global leadership in cinema
they did not accompany that desire with an effort to construct a
global perspective on human lives and cultures. While filmmak-
ers were probablv no worse than most political and opinion
leaders on issues of race and ethnic difference, they were rarely
capable of rising above the worst prejudices of their societies.
Their representation of peoples other than themsekes was far
from universal
in spirit;
it was more often narrow, low, and mean.
Race and Ethnicity
Distinctions might be made among three tvpes of racial and eth-
nic distortions found in European and United States films: those
drawn, p>erhaps without reflection, from the common fund of
stereotypes; those based on large-scale geopolitical viewpoints,
which were especially stimulated by the impact of World War
I
on empires, colonies, and new forces in international relations;
and those that may have been affected by specific circumstances,
such as the debate in California, where most American movies
were made, over restricting or totally banning immigration
from Asia. Their sources, to be sure, were often novels, stories,
and plays that had alreadv served to legitimate and popularize
opinions.
The few surviving films and the telltale titles—such as the
sixteen-part United States serial The Yellow Menace (191 6), with
an "arch villain" named Ali Singh—are only the tip of the ice-
berg. For example, the seeming confection Elusive /sabe/(1916)
concerns a plot, according to the Variety review, by "all of the
Latin speaking countries of the world ... to band against the
United States and finallv subdue and rule the territory."'
Sessue Hayakawa
A point of focus for this pervasive but historically elusive subject
is the remarkable film career in the United States of the Japanese
actor Sessue Havakawa
1 1 890-1 9731. As a young man Hayakawa
came to the United States and graduated from the University of
Chicago. He joined a Japanese theater companv in California
and was hired for movie roles.
In an era when acting st\'les were
changing from the vigorous emoting of primitive cinema, with
its
distant camera, to a more compact and concentrated perfor-
mance consistent with the close-up camera of the new narrative
mode, Hayakawa s controlled tension and stillness on screen
made him a notable figure. He appeared in more than forty films
by 1920, manv with his wife, the actress Tsuru .Aoki. In later
years he worked on stage and in European films, became a Zen

Award-nominated performance as commander of a )apanese

II prisoner-of-war camp in The Bridge on the River
Kwai{}957).
Ha\akawa's silent film roles ran the gamut of an earlier era's
stereotv pes about Japanese and other Asians, particularly those
living in the West. He was a valet; he was a valet who was also a
spv: he was a spv who was also a diplomat. iHe does not seem to
have pla\ed a Uni\ersit\ of Chicago graduate,
i Above all, his
movies were clarion calls against sexual relations between Cau-
casian women and Asian men. In film after film nothing but
disaster and traged\ ensue from such unions, married or illicit.
Nevertheless, Hayakawa once wrote that "public acceptance of
me in romantic roles was a blow of sorts against racial intoler-
ance."- More likely, his romantic roles were signs of public
fascination with, and dread of, what was still culturally
forbidden.
THE CHEAT.
The most notorious of Hayakawa 's roies was as a
wealthv Japanese art dealer in Cecil B. DeMille's The Cheat
(191 5
1.
It was so inflammatoPi that Japanese-American groups in
California protested, and in a 1918 rerelease his character was
changed to a "Burmese ivorN' king." He
is a figure in the Long
Island, New York, "smart set" who
is attracted to the spendthrift
wife of a hardworking stock broker. She is custodian of 510,000
in the Red Cross fund to send relief supplies to Belgium, but a
friend persuades her to put
it in the stock market. Disaster strikes
when the money
is completely lost. But the Japanese man offers
to give her monev to cover her disgrace
if she will consent to be
his lover. She accepts.
Unexpectedly her husband has made a success in the market,
and she manages to obtain SI 0,000 to pav back the art dealer,
but he refuses the money. She threatens to
kill herself. He hands
her a gun. In a harrowing scene, thev scuffle; he grabs her by the
hair, and brands her shoulder w ith the signature iron he uses on
his ivories. She fires the gun, wounding him. The husband sud-
denl\ appears, picks up the gun, and
is captured as the assailant.
The husband's trial
is an even more stunning sequence. The
Japanese man testifies falseK that the husband shot him; the hus-
band claims
it happened while he was trying to disarm the art
dealer. The verdict; guiltN. Then the wife steps forward and sa\s
she fired the shot. "This
is mv defense," she savs, and bares the
brand on her shoulder. The men in the courtroom rush at the
Asian man, who
is bareK saved from the riotous crowd. The
judge sets aside the \erdict and dismisses the indictment.
Husband and wife walk together out of the courtroom, applauded
b\ the spectators. As in The Birth of a \ation, all
is forgiven in
defense of racial purit\. The famous dictum of Rudvard Kipling,
"East
is East and West
is West and ne\er the twain shall meet,"
is
one of the film's intertitles.
Broken Blossoms
D. W. Griffith turned to this same theme in his first major post-
World War
I film. Broken Blossoms i^9^9).
It took a markedK
different approach, but came to a similar conclusion. This film
was hailed in
its time, as well as by later historians, as the first
authenticallv "poetic" work of cinema art. Thev were referring to
the camera work of cinematographer Hendrik Sarto\. a former
portrait photographer who used techniques of soft focus (diffus-
ing the image, usually with material covering the lens) and
backlighting (lighting the subject from behind) to complement the
pertormance of Lillian Cish (1893-19931; to the atmospheric sets
of London's dockside district shrouded in smoke and fog; and to
the ubiquitous use of masking 'blocking off parts of the frame
image to create different shafx^ within the framei.
It would be
difficult to imagine that they had in mind the narrative of brutal-
ity, murder, and suicide.
The framing theme
is once again the unbridgeable difference
between East and West. The film opens in a Chinese port city,
where a "sensitive yellow man" (played by Richard Barthelmess)
dreams of carrying a message of peace to barbarous Anglo-
Saxons. His ineffectual attempt to stop a brawl among Caucasian
sailors, where he lands unceremoniously on his backside, reveals
at once the impracticalits of the dream.
In the next scene he
is a
"Chink storekeeper" in a squalid Lond(jn slum
blotting out his
dreams with an opium pipe.
The other protagonists are a prizefighter
i Donald Crisp) and his
daughter (Gishi, whom he constantly abuses. After a cruel whip-
ping at his hands, she takes refuge in the Chinese man's shop. He
takes care of her, dresses her in Asian robes—and desires her
"white skin." One of the most curious and contradictory intertitles
in silent film reads: "His love remains a pure and holy thing
even his worst foe savs this." His foes have no wav of knowing,
and when they find out she is in his shop they assume something
quite different. The prizefighter wrecks the room where his
daughter has been staving and takes her home. She locks herself
in a closet and whirls about the enclosed space in terror as he
smashes in the door with an ax; he drags her out and beats her to
death.
It
is one of the most painful scenes of male violence
against women in cinema histor\. The Chinese man fatally shoots
the prizefighter and carries the daughter's body back with him
before taking his own
life.
Broken Blossoms is a film of manv meanings. On one level
it is
a comment on the brutalization of European society by World
War
I, for which the prizefighter's beha\ ior is a microcosm. Near
the end a policeman
is show n reading a newspaper and remark-
ing, "Better than last week—onlv fort> thousand casualties."
Another scene, where one clerg\ man tells another, "Mv brother
leaves for China tomorrow to con\ert the heathen," surelv
is
meant to be ironic. The Chinese dream of peace is depicted as
spiritually superior but also lacking power, vitalifs, effectiveness.
It
is passive, perhaps effeminate, subject to violation b\ the tur-
moil of the West. Yet the film's center lies in
its subtitle: "The
Yellow Man and the Girl." His fantasy of possessing the "alabaster
Cockney girl
"
is
its emotional core,
in
its way a greater transgres-
sion, more subject to containment and denial, than a father's
murderous brutalit\ toward his child.
German Cinema
The German cinema was also enthralled by the exotic. This mav
have arisen on different grounds than in the United States.
Defeated in the war, Germanv had lost its colonial empire.
Its
view of the relations be^veen East and West was colored by its
position as an outsider in pos^var geopolitics.
Among filmmakers who turned their attention to foreign adven-
tures was the Austrian artist Fritz Lang (1890-19761, who would
become one of the world's most important directors, working in
Germans and the United States. Lang began his film career after
the war in Germany w ith several films on the theme of interracial
romance, including Halbblut (Halthreed) and Harakiri, based on

his most significant work in the genre, the two-part Die Spinnen
{The Spiders, 1919-20)—reconstructed by film historians in the
1970s and rereleased with English intertitles.
THE SPIDERS.
Hero of The Spiders is Kay Hoog, San
Francisco millionaire adventurer, whose nemesis
is the seductive
Lio Sha, female leader of the secret society the Spiders. Part One,
Der goldene See {The Golden Lake), opens in a foreign setting
with a native shooting a white man
in the back with an arrow,
just as the man
is tossing a bottle with a message into the sea.
California Hoog—a film ancestor of Indiana Jones—finds the
message and learns that descendants of the Incas possess unbe-
lievable treasures in Peru. The Spiders steal the message, and
Hoog and his enemies race to South America. There Hoog res-
cues an Inca princess, Naela, from a deadly snake, and brings
her back to San Francisco after all the Incas and Spiders (save Lio
Sha) perish. Lio Sha offers her love to Hoog; after he spurns her.
88

he finds Princess Naela murdered, a spider on her chest.
Shifting attention to Asia, Part Two, Das Brilliantenschiff [The
Diamond Ship), centers on a search tor a diamond resembling
the head of Buddha. Westerners had taken the diamond from
China's Ming d\ nast\
in the sixteenth centurv.
If
it is returned to
Asia b\ a princess,
"Asia will free itself from foreign tyranny." The
Spiders want the diamond, presumably as a means to kick the
foreigners out and themseKes become rulers of Asia. Hoog's
desire to bring the Spiders to justice for Naela's murder leads him
to a secret subterranean Chinese city beneath San Francisco's
Chinatow n, and eventually to the Falkland Islands, where he
finds the diamond. He foils both the Spiders and something
called the "Asian Committee," whose East Indian operatives also
want the diamond.
The film seems to posit western imperialism as a tyranny, but
its hero fights to preserve
it. This contradictory view might be as
revisionist on the subject of East-West relations as a mainstream
western cinema was capable of achieving.
ARCHITECTURAL EXOTICISM
The uni\ersai language ot cinema was also spoken b\ the buildings
in which films were shown. For the first several decades of movies
their space was borrcAved—from stage theaters and music halls
down to sideshow tents and converted stores. Around 1910, how-
ex er, architects were given the challenge to design spaces for the
screening of motion pictures alone. Their choices would do nearly
as much to define the meaning of cinema for twentieth<entury cul-
ture as the films themselves. Almost from the beginning of their
efforts, the symbols of exotic cultures would be their preference as
the fantasv setting to enhance the spectator's pleasure in the
moviegoing experience.
One of the first freestanding theaters constructed for motion pic-
tures established the motif. This was the Cines-Theatre opened in
191
1 on Nollendorfplatz in Berlin, Germany, a countr\ that was
among the leaders in film theater construction.
It was an imposing
stone structure w ith blank walls facing the streets on three sides.
The entrance was recessed and half-domed, surmounted by a
Buddha-like statue."^ New movie theaters in other countries also
utilized western architectural sU les ranging from the classical to the
baroque. In the United States, Thomas W. Lamb i1871-
1 942', a Scottish-born architect, designed se\eral of the famous
Times Square theaters in New York ithe Strand, the Rialto, c;nd the
Rivoli, opened between 1914 and 191 7» in the framework of tradi-
tional European st\ les, as well as theaters in such other cities as
Cincinnati, Kansas Cit\, and San Francisco. B\ the end of the
1910-20 decade, however, "Orientalism" had come to the fore in
motion picture theater design as ,\sian subjects had also done in
the films themselves.
''Atmospfheric" Theaters
The trade term for theaters in the "Oriental" stvie was atmospheric.
The architect most closely associated with this approach was John
Eberson
1 1875-1 954', born in Austria, whose first "atmospheric,"
the Majestic Theatre in Houston, Texas, opened in 1922. While
their side walls and screen prosceniums were exotic renderings
deri\ed from building st\ les across the globe, their interior ceilings
were designed to resemble an outdoor night skv, complete with
^vinkling lights to represent stars and projected images of moving
clouds. Eberson brought the world to the American heartland: he
designed theaters in Akron. Ohio; Louisville, Kentuckv; Detroit,
Kalamazoo, and Flint Michigan; Nashville, Tennessee; Wichita,
Kansas: Omaha, Nebraska; and man\ other cities. Their designs
embodied the universal language theme. Their fantas\ spaces took
spectators out of everyday life and placed them in a world com-
mensurate with the spatial and temporal universalism of the
mo\ ies—where st\ les from .Asia and the Middle East met and min-
gled with Moorish Spain and the American Southwest. "You can
step from Randolph Street—into the glor\ and glamor and romance
of the Orient!" read the opening da\ ad\ertisement crediting one of
many Oriental Theaters with "bringing to Chicago the jeweled
splendor of the Far East."^ The space of fantas\ lacked completely
the fear and disdain western films often expressed toward Asian
peoples.

It's rarely safe to declare that any aspect
of the entertainment world
is gone for-
ever: styles, genres, stories, promotional
campaigns that seem as old as the hills
have a way of coming back (sometimes
in updated technological guise) claiming
to be fresher than ever. But one figure
it
is difficult to imagine will make a return
is the old-fashioned exhibitor, the
"showman" of the early decades of
movies (there were surely "showwomen"
as well, but their history has yet to be
written).
They were personages in their com-
munities. They staged public events to
promote their theaters and individual
films. They took pride in doing more
than just turning on the projector,
shaping varied programs of live enter-
tainment, short films, cartoons, and
newsreels along with the featured pic-
ture. They were the front-line troops of
the movie business, counting the house,
listening to an audience's pleasure or
discontent, hearing individual voices
from the crowds of moviegoers.
Running a theater was one of the best
schools for learning the dogmas of "what
the public wants," and from that founda-
tion a number of exhibitors went into the
production end of the business. The
ranks of movie moguls were filled with
former theater operators; Carl Laemmie
of Universal, Adolph Zukor of Famous

Players-Lasky (Paramount), and William
Fox of the Fox Film Corp., the three
companies that emerged as leaders in
the United States film industry around
World War
I,
all had experience as
exhibitors. Marcus Loew (1870-1927), a
pioneer exhibitor, ran Loew's,
Inc., a the-
ater organization that was the parent
company of M-C-M, whose head of pro-
duction, Louis B. Mayer, also began in
exhibition. The Warner brothers, Harry
M., Albert (1884-1967), Sam
(1 888-1 927), and Jack
L., who led the
way in sound production in the 1920s at
their Warner Bros, studio, started as trav-
eling exhibitors and nickelodeon
operators.
Sid Grauman, of Grauman's Chinese
and other Los Angeles theaters, did not
go into film production, but that did not
mean he was not a producer. He pro-
duced scores of elaborate prologues
between 1918 and
1 934, as live enter-
tainment introductions to feature films,
and produced Hollywood previews that
filled Hollywood Boulevard with crowds
estimated at up to fifty thousand specta-
tors eager to glimpse the stars arriving at
Grauman's Chinese.
Grauman's legendary promotional
legacy was the forecourt of Grauman's
Chinese, in which movie stars implanted
their hand- or footprints into concrete.
The showman
is reputed to have gotten
the idea from a mason working on the
theater construction crew, who made a
special concrete mixture in which he
placed his handprint as a record of his
work on a job. The mason kept his for-
mula a secret, so the story goes, and sold
Grauman a batch whenever a star's
prints were to be enshrined.
Francisco showman (he screened movies in a tent after the 1906
earthquake), he opened a Los Angeles theater, the Million Dollar,
in
1 91 8. The top ticket price was 25 cents.
That same year he began to offer "prologues" to feature films.
These were live stage performances designed to preview and
complement the movie. For example, when the Million Dollar
offered The City of Dim Faces (1 91 8), yet another Sessue Haya-
kawa interracial romance melodrama, set in San Francisco's
Chinatown, Grauman's prologue was a Chinatown street facade
with twenty Chinese performers. Prologues sometimes ran nearly
as long as the feature and often drew more acclaim. These live
performances became a key part of big-city movie programs
throughout the 1920s, and companies formed to produce elabo-
rate prologues that traveled from theater to theater. They were
phased out in the
1 930s, a luxury that exhibitors could no longer
afford in the economic crisis of the Great Depression. One such
prologue producer, Fanchon and Marco, was the prototype for
the company that provided the storyline of a
1 933 musical film,
Footlight Parade.
In 1922 Grauman opened his first fantasy theater on
Hollywood Boulevard, Grauman's Egyptian.
Its screen was
flanked by four immense columns covered by hieroglyphics, and
above the screen were four bands of pictographs stretching from
one side of the auditorium to the other (a number of Egyptian-
style cinemas were also constructed in Britain in the early
1 920s). The most famous of Grauman's fantasy movie palaces,
the Chinese Theater in Hollywood, opened in 1927. Renowned
as a site for klieg-light premieres,
it was also the theater where

is one of the most recognizable sights in cinema
history.
Within months of opening the Chinese Theater, however,
Crauman discovered he could no longer operate
it as an inde-
pendent exhibitor. The major Hollywood studios retained their
important films for first-run release in theaters that thev owned,
denving to the independent Crauman movies of a stature that his
lavish theater demanded. Crauman decided he needed to strike a
deal with one of the major companies, the Fox Film Corp., in
order to gain access to
its hit titles. He sold his Million Dollar
and Egvptian theaters, only to be replaced bv Fox as manager of
the Chinese ithough he later returned).
HOLLYWOOD'S GLOBAL
DOMINATION
\\ hat happened to Sid Crauman in the heart of the United States
motion picture industry was a microcosm of industrial domina-
tion on a global scale. The universal language of cinema had all
the hallmarks of English spoken w ith an American accent.
Several factors had led to the emergence of the United States,
soon after World War
I, as the strongest force in the world film
marketplace: distributors and exhibitors in many countries pre-

ferred to gain higher profits by showing foreign films instead of
supporting local filmmaking; European colonial control over a
considerable part of the globe continued to give central place to
western commerce and culture; and European (particularly
French and Italian) domination of world film markets gave way
because of production cutbacks during World War
i, allowing
United States film companies to
fill the void. Another source of
the new American leadership derived from developments in the
United States itself.
Vertical Integration
Following the demise of the Motion Picture Patents Company,
which had integrated a number of production firms under
its
banner, a new group of independent companies had taken over
leadership of the film industry with the tactic of vertical integra-
tion (see Chapter 3). With Famous Players-Lasky in the forefront,
these companies built and purchased theaters, especially first-run
houses in the big cities. Though they never owned a majority of
the thousands of theaters scattered
in nearly every town and vil-
lage across the United States, their control over the metropolitan
theaters gave them significant advantages in revenues, promo-
tion, and publicity. They could largely determine what spectators
in provincial theaters would want to see. They sold their films to
independent theaters not individually but in "blocks": exhibitors
had to take many mediocre films to get the one or two big hits.
The system operated on volume: theaters in smaller towns played
over
1 00 films in a year.
In 1919 Paramount, the distribution arm
of Famous Players-Lasky, alone distributed 139 features.
This system enabled the major United States companies to
make a profit on most of their films in the domestic market; when
Europe faltered, they had the product and the capital to expand
rapidly into foreign markets. The statistical story of United States
film domination has been recorded in different ways—sometimes
as a percentage of film footage imported, taxed, or viewed by
censors; sometimes as a percentage of film titles imported,
screened, or viewed bv censors; and onlv rarely bv more accu-
94

rate methods, such as share of playdates in theaters or, most spe-
cific of all, percentage of box office admissions. Nevertheless,
these different methods produce generally similar conclusions:
75 to 90 percent of the films screened in most countries during
the period between the two world wars were from the United
States.
The consequences for the international development of film
were, to be sure, enormous. Many countries struggled to retain
the foundation of a "national" film industry, while creative per-
sonnel and film financing capital moved from country to country
seeking greater opportunities ithese themes will be explored fur-
ther in Chapter 6). Hollywood became a magnet for foreign film
professionals. From Britain, Scandinavia, Central Europe, and
elsewhere came not only directors and performers but creative
figures such as cinematographers and art directors who brought
European styles to United States films, creating an international
look to American films that reinforced their claim to speak a uni-
versal language.
Government Intervention
An effort to prevent, or at least curtail. United States domination
arose in the form of government protection of domestic film
industries. Germany, whose government had been closely
involved with developing film production,
in 1921 enacted the
first laws limiting film imports. The quota of foreign films was
1 5
percent of domestic production, measured in footage rather than
film
titles. Though more films came in than the quota strictly per-
mitted, the law did keep American films from flooding the
German market.
Italy, Britain, Portugal, France, Hungary, and Austria also
passed film quota legislation in the 1920s.
Italy's laws sougiit to
require the country's theaters to show only Italian films one week
out of every two months. Britain enacted quotas that applied
both to distributors and to exhibitors; as a base figure, British
films were to constitute 7.5 percent of all films handled by dis-
tributors and 5 percent of films exhibited, and these minimums
were gradually to increase over a period of years. Portugal
required every film program to include at least one domestically
produced one-reel
(ten- to fifteen-minute) film. Legislation in France, Hungary, and
Austria tried to use import quotas as an incentive to produce
domestic films; for every local film a company produced (or
exported),
it was to receive a certain number of licenses to
import foreign films.
Foreign involvement in all branches of film activity in many of
these countries often eroded the laws' effects. In Britain, for
example, production subsidiaries of United States companies
made inexpensive films, called "quota quickies," to insure that
enough "domestic" films were made to meet the quota require-
ments. This made a travesty of the quota's purpose to encourage
development of domestic filmmaking. The advent of recorded
sound films in the late
1 920s put an end to the rhetoric of cin-
ema as a universal language—but
it made little difference in the
distribution of power among the world's film industries.

communications medium emanating
from one country had ever before extended a voice so expan-
sively. No military power, no imperial administration, had cast
its
leadership so far and wide. Only the world's great religions were
comparable forces with such enormous reach. To be sure, these
faiths held an incomparably more important place in the lives of
their adherents than did American movies. Yet films from the
United States were able to connect with spectators of many
beliefs.
A considerable part of this remarkable supremacy derived from
a single word, which came to symbolize the American motion
picture industry: Hollywood. The name was new to history. A
western district of Los Angeles, at the turn of the twentieth century
it had been a rural outpost, a few houses among the fruit groves.
As a burgeoning motion picture community,
it was able to
develop
its own resonance,
its own mystique. New York already
possessed broad cultural significance, as did Rome or Paris or
Berlin. Hollywood meant only one thing: American movies.
THE RISE OF HOLLYWOOD
Hollywood was as much a generic name as a place on the map.
By 1920 probably a majority of United States feature films were
produced
in Hollywood;
still, filmmaking went on all over the Los
Angeles area,
in such places as Culver City, a western suburb, and
an incorporated town in San Fernando Valley owned by Universal
Pictures, called Universal City. Though movies continued to be
produced all over the United States, Hollvwood and
its environs
came more and more to dominate the industry. Southern Califor-
nia offered inexpensive real estate, a sunny climate, and varied
locales.
It made possible a new lifestyle, grounded
in hard work
but emphasizing leisure, sports, and the outdoors. Movie people
came to be called a "colony," a separate community unto
themselves.
New York Production
Throughout the 1920s, New York remained a substantial center for
film production. Vitagraph continued
in Brooklyn, Fox and Para-
mount (Famous Players-Lasky) retained studios in Manhattan, and
the latter firm was soon to open a new studio complex
in the bor-
ough of Queens. Performers from the Broadway theater made
movies in the daytime and appeared on stage at night. (With the
coming of sound at the end of the decade, dozens of actors aban-
doned the theater and went out to Hollywood, where pav was
better and work more steady.) New York partisans complain that
film history has neglected the important contribution of East Coast
production to American cinema. The point
is well taken, though
it
is also the case that film production made up onK
a small part of
New York's cultural activities, while "Hollywood" came to define
a whole new moviemaking way of life.
Hollywood Studios
Hollywood (with Culver City and Universal City) was home to the
vast studio lots that were central to the world's image of American
filmmaking. "Here are found," wrote the Paramount company in a
98

trade advertisement,
"the huge sky-light buildings tor interiors
Ibef'ore sound production made necessary more substantial

departments, acres of out-door locations, whole cities built for

."' You had to see them from an airplane to grasp their
immensit\. Up close,
all that was visible was a nondescript gate
w ith a guard to block entrance, and perhaps a glimpse of a stand-
ing set high above surrounding walls.
Industry Consolidation
There were several dozen such lots, as they were called, around
the Los Angeles area in 1920, though few of course as grand
as Paramount's. In the rapidiv progressing vertical integration of
the American movie industry (described in Chapter 4), con-
solidation was alreadv setting in. More than 750 feature films
were produced in the United States in 1920, slightlv fewer
than in each of the four previous years. Six companies and their
affiliates accounted for nearlv half this number. Fox Film Corp.
and Paramount /Famous Pla\ers-Lasky were approximatelv
equal at the top in terms of total releases, followed b\
Pathe,
Universal, Goidwyn Pictures Corp., and Metro Pictures Corp.
All told, about two-thirds of the films came from fewer than a
dozen companies.
THE FILM DIRECTOR
To highlight the director
is not to endorse an
auteur theory,"
which holds that certain "great
" directors become "authors" of
their films by placing a personal stylistic signature on otherwise
industrial products of the Hollvwood system.
It
is first of all a
recognition of historical circumstance and archival practice: while
most films from the 1920s have been lost,
it
is the films of famous
directors (along with several world- renowned stars) that are most
likely to have been preserved in archives and that continue to be
circulated and screened. These films, even
if by default, form the
canon of classic works. To spotlight the director
is a necessary
step in reexamining the historical record.
It calls attention not sim-
ply to the director's role in Hollywood but, more significantly, to
ho\% that role was debated and struggled over in the years after
World War
I.
Directorial Indcf^endence
If consolidation and concentration were the central developments
in the United States movie industry during the 1920s, then inde-
pendence marked their antithesis. Independent production has
been a kev term in American filmmaking throughout most of the
twentieth century, beginning around 1910 when
it was applied to
N THE
1 920S
This was but a snapshot, because the logic (and power) of con-
centration was o\er\\ helming. Production companies needed
their own theaters; exhibition companies needed a guaranteed
source of production. Smaller companies were swiftiv being
absorbed bv larger. By 1920 Thomas A. Edison's company had
ceased feature film production, as had other important firms from
the early years of cinema. B\ 1924 Gold\\\n and Metro were
absorbed into a new production company, Metro-Goldw\ n-
Mayer (M-G-M), a subsidiary' of Loew's, Inc. The advent of sound
production brought newer companies like Warner Brothers to the
forefront and set off a fresh wave of acquisition and consolidation.
Powerful company heads became known as "movie moguls.
These included Adolph Zukor at Paramount, Louis B. Maver
(1885-1957) of M-G-M, William Fox, and brothers Harr\ M.
Warner (1881-19581 and Jack L. Warner (1892-1978).
Mode ofProduction
How do we find ways of thinking about a film industry that was
producing (when short films such as two-reel comedies are
counted
in) more than one thousand pictures a year? Genres and
stars are two obvious approaches, since these were categories the
motion picture companies themselves used in distribution opera-
tions. Another wa\
is to think in general terms of the mode of
production— how films are planned and produced, the contribu-
tions of craft workers such as cinematographers and film editors to
the visual style and narrative movement of typical films. All these
aspects will occupy our attention. But inevitably we need to raise
the issue of the film director's role in the mammoth production
system Hollywood was becoming.
the production companies outside the Motion Picture Patents
trust. ,A decade later, when former independents like Fox and
Universal and Famous Players-Lask\ had become the industry's
leaders, the independents were small production firms headed by,
or named after, big-name directors and stars.
The Role ofIndep>endents
This new form of independence was out of step w ith vertical inte-
gration of the industry'. These companies did not want to operate
distribution subsidiaries and theaters: their purpose was to gain
big-name directors and stars more mone\ and more creati\e free-
dom. They needed financing to make films, distributors willing to
market them, theaters w illing to show them. In later eras (espe-
cialK
after 1948, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the
system of vertical integration as a violation of antitrust laws), the
studios were more w illing to accommodate and support the inde-
pendents. In the eark
1920s, however, when the monopoK
structure was just forming, the major studios began to gobble
them up. Those that suryi\ed became part of \erticall\
integrated
units that supported independents, such as United Artists, a
financing and distribution company that in the 1920s acquired
theaters, or First National, an exhibitor-owned compan\
that
acquired and distributed films produced b\ independents.
Independence and Film Quality
Did independent production result in better films? Here the rules
of the canon come into play: films from the early 1920s that have
been preserved and valorized b\ cinema histor\ overwhelmingK
have been independent works. Among the productions of leading

Nevertheless, whatever changes in emphasis and evaluation may

A history of women as creative workers in
Hollywood has yet to be written. Less
than a handful of women directors who
worked before the 1980s have been
talked about, even by specialists—Alice
Guy Blache for the early years, Lois
Weber after World War
I, Dorothy Arzner
in the 1930s, Ida Lupino after World
War

.^m
ably more. Women screenwriters are
somewhat better known, but the study of
women in that profession only makes
more clear the fate of women directors
until recently: when a job took on pres-
tige or became high-paying, women were
frequently shunted aside. The World
War
I era was a high point for women
directors, who found more opportunities
then, before the industry consolidated
into a few major companies (and when
women stars
still headed independent
production units). Women screenwriters
remained prominent at the major studios
until the sound era commenced, when
writing, too, became almost entirely a
man's profession.

sympathetic treatment of sexual desire across racial boundaries.

Tourneur's opportunities for independence waned after First
National, which distributed his films in the early 1920s, opened
its
own studio for production. He then went to work for major com-
panies, making Never the Twain Shall Meef (1925) for M-G-M and
Aloma of the South Seas (1926) for Paramount, both about roman-
tic yearnings, eventually frustrated, between South Seas maidens
and North American men. He resisted being placed under the
authority of a producer, however, and in 1927
left an M-C-M film
in midproduction. Returning to his native France, Tourneur
directed more than twenty films in Europe in a career lasting until
the late 1940s, though none gained the prominence of his early
United States silents.
Lois Weber (1882-1939) followed Alice Guy Blache as an
important woman film director (Blache's last film was made in
1920). Directing since the early 1910s, Weber established her pro-
duction company in 1917 and kept
it going through 1921. She
wrote, directed, and produced a number of domestic dramas,
including The Blot (1921
), concerning the family
life of an under-
paid professor. Their genteel poverty

contrast to the bounty enjoyed by a family of fat foreigners living
next door, that she steals a chicken from their kitchen— then puts
it back. Weber's gritty realism proved less popular with audiences
in the 1920s than
it had been
in the World War
I period, and
she had difficulty finding directorial assignments when not her
own boss.
D.
vv. GRIFFITH.
Could the director with the greatest prestige
in United States motion pictures avoid a similar fate? We do not
know the specific details of any tactical errors Tourneur or Weber
may have made in resisting the tide of consolidation, but those of
D. W. Griffith have been thoroughly chronicled. He already had
his own production company; what he wanted was his own stu-
dio, which he acquired
in 1920 not in Hollywood, or even New
York City, but in the suburban isolation of Mamaroneck, New
York. The costs of converting an estate into a functioning motion
picture facility and maintaining the property and staff created a
problem of overhead expenses that other independents, who
rented studio space as needed, did not have.
This affected Griffith's business relationships. Films such as Way
Down East (^920) he chose to open as "road shows" (special
bookings at premium prices before general release) because he
did not want to share income with a distributor. This meant, how-
ever, that he also bore alone the costs of prints and promotion.
It
also had the effect of alienating small exhibitors and cutting into
first-run revenues when the films were officially released.
Griffith's only big money-making film of the early 1920s, Way
Down East, an adaptation of a late-nineteenth-century stage melo-
drama, did not contribute to Griffith's reputation as cinema's great
innovator. But this "Simple Story of Plain People," as
it was sub-
titled, appealed to old-fashioned tastes in a modernizing world.
and continues to exert
its power a century later. A naive country
gid, portrayed by Lillian Gish,
is seduced and abandoned by a city
slicker. She gives birth and her baby dies,
in a sequence with
intertitles such as "Maternity—Woman's Gethsemane." Working
with a farm family when her past
is discovered, she
is banished
into a winter storm by that melodramatic stock figure, the outraged
patriarch who opens the door and points into the swiding snow.
She collapses on an ice floe in a river whose current
is carrying
her inexorably toward a waterfall. Griffith's style of crosscutting to
heighten drama and tension, familiar from The Birth of a Nation
and Intolerance, here records another of its triumphs in this
thrilling sequence of danger and ultimate rescue.
Griffith returned to historical epics with Orphans of the Storm
(1921
), also based on a nineteenth-century melodrama, this one
with the story shifted in time and place into the turmoil of the
French Revolution. Despite continued critical acclaim and box
office success, Griffith could not control his expenses. He fell
deeper into debt from bank loans obtained to finance pictures
which, though popular, did not earn back their high costs. In 1924
he came to the end of the line as his own boss. He became a stu-
dio director for Paramount, where the former giant of American
movies could not accommodate well to working as a subordinate.
Griffith made his last film in 1931.
ERICH VON STROHEIM. Then there was Erich von Stroheim
(1885-1957). An Austrian immigrant who claimed he was an aris-
tocrat and a military officer, he gained success in Hollywood by
playing roles as German villains in World War
I movies (his endur-
ing legend
is as "The Man You Love to Hate," though the origin of
this phrase remains obscure, even to his biographers). After the
war he pitched a script to Universal for a project on which he
would also become the director and star. The film. Blind
Husbands (1919), a love-triangle story involving a neglected
American wife and an aristocratic Austrian officer (played, of
course, by von Stroheim), became one of the most auspicious
debuts in United States film history.
Its critical and financial suc-
cess seemed to justify the director's excesses: over-budget and
over-schedule, he lavished time and money on lengthy rehearsals,

The practice of
hand-coloring individual frames
was largely abandoned in the
1920s. (Foolish Wives was one ol
the few films of the post-World
War
I era in which the method
( ontinued to he used, and only
some of the prints in circulation
were so treated). Given Holly-
wood's scale of operations in the
1920s, wider audiences could
liain access to films in color
when the celluloid image was
mechanically tinted or dvcd. Film
manufacturers such as Eastman
Kodak prepared positive film
stock with different color bases
and dves and suggested how dif-
ferent colors could be used to
enhance dramatic moods i.
details of art direction, and painstaking editing. The result was an
intensity of performance and psychological realism of character
unusual
in American cinema.
But these were a rookie's excesses compared to his third film,
Foolish Wives (1922).
It took almost a year to produce and ran
nearly a million dollars lor close to 400 percent) over the original
budget. A huge set representing the casinos of Monte Carlo, a
resort on the Mediterranean Sea, was built on the back lot of
Universal City. Then a duplicate set was constructed along the
California coast hundreds of miles away, showing the opposite
oceanfront side of the same casinos. The director's cut was over
five hours long and included segments colored by hand (common
in earlier days, hand-coloring had become rare with feature films,
which more frequently used mechanical tinting processes). The
studio cut Foolish lV;Ves by two-thirds before release. In the eyes
of the film industry, von Stroheim, though a talented director, was
irresponsible and insubordinate. To the press and public (aided by
von Stroheim's own pronouncements) he was the first important
director to emerge in Hollywood since the war, a unique artist
thwarted by the narrow business values that increasingly came to
dominate United States filmmaking.
His career over the remainder of the decade oscillated between
these poles: fired at one company, he would receive a generous
offer from another. When he was dismissed in the middle of a pic-
ture at Universal, he signed on with Goldwyn and began work on
a project even more vast than Foolish lV;Ves, a film based on the
1899 novel McTeague by the American naturalist writer Frank
Norris. The result, Creed (1924), cost half as much as Foolish
Wives, but the director wanted to release a nine-hour version.
Goldwyn had been by this time merged into Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer, and the new companv's head of production was none
other than Irving Thalberg (1899-1936i, the young executive who

quarters. Even this pastiche contains some of the most remarkable
sequences of cinematographic realism
in American silent cinema,
from extensive location shooting designed to give portions of the
film the appearance of nonfiction (other segments, meanwhile,
were shot in expressionist style).
These were not von Stroheim's only troubles with the studios.
On The Wedding March (1928), Paramount executives replaced
von Stroheim during editing because the director again wanted to
release a film they considered too long. The von Stroheim legend
was capped
in 1928-29 during the shooting of Queen Kelly, pro-
duced by Joseph
P. Kennedy (father of President John
F. Kennedy)
for the independent company of its star, Gloria Swanson (1899-
1983). Fearful about costs and censorship problems, Kennedy and
Swanson fired von Stroheim midway through production; the film
was completed by others but never shown
in the United States. A

its excesses, von Stroheim's experience— and his fate
defined the terrain. The businessmen were in charge (when had
they not been?). Independence for directors was rarely a produc-
tion possibility within the American film industry over the next
several decades.
THE POWER OF STARS
A few big-name stars were able to hold out longer against indus-
trial consolidation. Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Charles
Chaplin, having established (along with Griffith) their own financ-
ing and distribution company, United Artists, managed to keep
control over their own work, so long as they maintained their box
office appeal— and avoided Griffith's financial excesses. The
enemy, perhaps, was time. Fairbanks and Pickford,
in particular,
had prospered on screen images of vouth. How long could they
remain, respectively, the juvenile and the ingenue? The question
was especially pertinent when, after divorcing their previous
spouses, they married in March 1920,
in Hollywood's first big
celebrity marriage.
Douglas Fairbanks
Fairbanks carried his middle-class boy hero over into his first sev-
eral United Artists efforts, but started transforming
it with The
Mark of Zorro (1920), which marked the beginning of a shift to
historical costume roles. By day he was an effete and idle young
man, by night the fearless masked Zorro, fighter against an oppres-
sive Mexican government in early-nineteenth-century Southern
California. (The story was resurrected for a 1957-59 television
series.)
It was very much a transitional film,
in terms of both
Fairbanks's "double" persona and the fact that director Fred Niblo
(1874-1948) frequently had difficulty capturing the star's athletic
feats within the frame. But
its success led Fairbanks— as he
approached the age of forty— completely to adopt a new screen
role, performing as the great (and ageless) adventure heroes of
wodd literature.
First he was D'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers (1921
), then
the heroes of Robin Hood (]922) and The Thief of Bagdad 0924),
based on the Arabian Nights legends. For Robin Hood, with

among the women. Their careers developed as studio employees,
but both sought the independence that Fairbanks and Picklord
had established tor themselves through United Artists. Valentino's
ett'orts were cut short by his untimely death; Swanson's were
undercut by the debacle of Queen Kelly.
RUDOLPH VALE\Tl,\a.
Valentino's legend as the silent
era's most controversial screen lover, relegated tor decades to the
realm ot tabloid sensationalism, has begun to attract new atten-
tion from the historical study of female spectatorship. He was a
figure perhaps unique in film histon,, a male star whose popular-
its

ol gender and sexuality that made him a signpost of contention
between men and women during his brief career?"
His was a screen p)ersona created bv women, according to one
version of his legend— particulaHy by screenwriter )une Mathis
(1892-1927), who wrote four of his most important films. Thus he
was not a "manK " man, a 'regular guv," so the argument went,
but one w hose screen appearance gave pleasure only to women.
Certainly one asp>ect of his app>eal came from his representation
of the exotic— as an Italian whose characters were frequently
Spanish or Hispanic American, he was the
"Latin lover" whose
screen romances w ith Caucasian women touched the same eth-
nic and racial boundaries as had those of Sessue Havakawa. In
The Sheik (1921

Alary Pickford
Pickford was a decade \ounger than her new husband, but
still
playing child roles in her late twenties. Like him, she tried to
develop her screen persona through historical costume dramas,
which, though successful at the box office, displeased the fans
who wished her forever \oung. Returning as a child, she gave the
part some perverse imagination
in at least one picture, Sparrows
(1926), directed b\ William Beaudine (1892-1970), which com-
bined comedv and melodrama. Pickford plavs the eldest child on
a swampv farm in the deep South where a cruel famiU keeps
orphans and babies stolen from the rich. With bow
lips and long
braided pigtails she leads her charges through harrow ing adven-
tures to a happ\ ending. Personal difficulties with Fairbanks
played a part in ending her career in the early 1930s; they were
divorced in 1936.
New Stars of the '1920s
For publicity and marketing purposes motion picture stars
became even more important during the 1920s, although top-
name players appeared only in a minority of major films.
Prominent in the new generation of \ounger stars were Rudolph

Among the four founders of United Artists, Charles Chaplin
remained active and autonomous the longest. His association
with the company ran through the 1950s, and his filmmaking
career ended in the late 1960s. Chaplin's screen persona, the
tramp, was most immune to the inroads of time, seemingly age-

less
if not timeless. During the 1920s he retained the persona
intact, although the volume of his output diminished. Early in the
decade he completed a
First National contract with four films
his first feature (a film longer than three reels), The /C/cf (1921
), and
a second. The Pilgrim (1922), and the short films The Idle Class
(1921
) and Pay Day (1922). Thereafter all his films were feature-
length. For United Artists he directed a drama, A Woman of Paris
(1923),
in which he played only a token, uncredited role. His
major comedies of the 1920s were The Gold Rush (1925) and The
C/rcus (1928).
Many Chaplin films have remained international favorites for
decades, but the work considered among his greatest— for many,
the outstanding film of his career—was The Cold Rush. Here, the
poignancy and humor of the tramp character were seamlessly
blended, and sustained for more than eighty minutes, his longest
film thus far. The heart of his comedy
is displayed in the "dinner"
scene: the famished prospectors, Charlie and Big )im (Mack
Swain, a former Keystone comic), cook and eat the tramp's shoe.
"Charlie attacks the sole with a gourmet's relish," Chaplin biogra-
pher Theodore Huff describes the scene, "twists the shoe laces
around his fork like spaghetti, and sucks the nails as
if they were
marrow bones."'
Postwar Comedians
Chaplin's competition came mainly from a new postwar genera-
tion of movie comedians. Chief among these were Buster Keaton
(1895-1966) and Harold Lloyd, who, like Chaplin, controlled
every aspect of their productions, even though others were some-
times credited as director. Both portrayed contemporary young
men coping with the modern world— Keaton as a bewildered but
ingenious figure amid the mysteries of machines, Lloyd as a bum-
bling but savvy bourgeois striver. In Sherlock, jr. (1924), Keaton
is
a movie projectionist who falls asleep and dreams himself into the
picture on screen, where he has a series of scrapes based on
rapid cuts from location to location; then he becomes a detective
in a film within the film. The Ceneral (]927), often considered his
finest film, places him back in history in the United States Civil
War, where he becomes a hero through a combination of imagi-
nation and dumb luck on a runaway railway engine. Lloyd's
screen persona gently mocked the middle-class ambitions of the
post-World War
I era. He
is indelibly remembered for precarious
scenes of danger where, out of foolishness, he finds himself hang-
ing from flagpoles and ledges of tall buildings, as in Safety Last
(1923),
in which he
is forced to impersonate a "human fly" and
climb the outside wall of a skyscraper.

Again. He returned to Europe, made several more films, and in
1925 committed suicide.
HOLLYWOOD GENRES
Central to the Hollywood mode of ()roduction was the concept of
genre. A genre
is a category or a type; genres are differentiated
from each other by characteristics of style, technique, or narrative
content. In studio productions, even before directors were
SSk

assigned or performers were cast, films were planned and written
in the framework of genres: What kind of film
is
it? A comedy; a
Western; a mystery; a love story.
Genres did not originate with the movies. They were an intrinsic
aspect of popular entertainment, intensified by the proliferation
and diversification of cultural products in the emerging mass soci-
ety. Genres came ready-made to the movies from theater, dime
novels, and magazine fiction. Writers on film genre generally
list
from six to a dozen basic categories, depending on how fine they
draw distinctions, and are capable of defining seemingly endless
variations. How many kinds of comedy have been identified, for
example? Comedy variants include slapstick, sophisticated, farce,
parody, "comedian" or clown (featuring comic stars or personali-
ties), and what has been called "populist" comedy—about
average people, sometimes with an underlying social message.
Moreover, genres can be amalgams of other genres— comedy-
drama, for instance— and films could, and often did, switch
genres in midreel, when cowboys, say, enter a haunted house.
This welter of generic possibility has led to containment through
theories of genre. One view
is that genres have a kind of life cycle,
in which they grow, mature, and decline. This might help to
explain why Western films, once among the most important
Hollywood genres, have rarely been made in the last quarter of
the twentieth century. Another approach
is to link the popularity
of generic categories with specific cultural and historical circum-
stances, which might account for genres such as horror or science
fiction lying dormant in some periods and flourishing in others.
Still a third places emphasis on factors within the film industry that
create genre cycles leading from innovation to emulation to
exhaustion.
Genre Codes
A fundamental aspect of genre filmmaking
is familiarity through
repetition. Genres develop codes of character type, visual style,
and narrative progression. Spectators become familiar with these
codes, anticipate them, and take satisfaction as they play them-
selves out within structures that allow, but limit, variation. The
history of storytelling
is not a history of incessant originality. To
"make
it new," however, became a supreme value of twentieth-
century high art, and in this context the new mass medium of
movies, as practiced by the Hollywood studios, was seen as hope-
lessly inartistic. We continue to grapple with this question,
designating, as we have seen, the director as the potential artist in
a generic and collaborative setting where writers, performers, art
directors, costume designers, cinematographers, picture and
sound editors, and many others contribute professional skills to the
outcome.
INTERTEXTUALITY. The concept of intertextuality— how texts
relate to other texts— has become central to our understanding of
all the arts, even the most advanced.
In the case of Hollywood,
this concept describes a clear-cut practice in which films refer to
other films: broadly, through shared codes, and minutely, through
specific textual citations (an object, a gesture, a phrase). These
small references were an intentional aspect of film production,
designed to encourage filmgoing by rewarding spectators who
have extensive knowledge of other films.
If we could see all the
Hollywood films made in a single year, or even a generous sam-
pling, the similarities would outweigh the differences—the
intertext looms as more important than the individual texts. In this
sense the films that have survived and make up the canon do not
have to be claimed as masterworks. They can be regarded as films
that may clearly have some special distinction yet also represent a
broad range of others that have been
lost or, though of lesser aes-
thetic stature, share many common traits.
The Woman's Film
Such a work, for example,
is Smouldering Fires (1924), belonging
to that amorphous category, the woman's film. A Universal pic-
ture, directed by Clarence Brown (1890-1987) and featuring

With such varied produc-
tions as the war epic The Big
Parade (1925), the realist drama
The Crowd (1928), and the com-
edy Show People (1928), King
Vidor was one of the most
accomplished directors of the
1920s. Under contract to M-C-M,
however, he also made films such
as the swashbuckler Bardelys the
Magnificent (1926), of which he
later said,
"I was a little ashamed
of It. " (He also satirized it, and
the swashbuckler genre, in Show
People.) Here Vidor (center, with
glasses) directs a shot in a camera
vehicle designed to simulate a

Pauline Frederick (1883-1938) and Laura La Plante (b. 1904),
it
is
distinguished by qualities of pace and craft that critics describe in
only the most general terms and are more easily notable by their
lack. Frederick plays a forty-year-old businesswoman who runs a
factory inherited at an early age from her father; asexual in dress
and appearance, she had no thought for romance until she falls
for a young employee. He,
in turn,
is smitten by her younger sister.
Though the executive and the young man marry, she soon discov-
ers his true feelings and gives him up so that youth can unite
with youth.
Sophisticated Comedy
Sophisticated comedy in the United States received a boost with
the arrival of German director Ernst Lubitsch, hired by Mary
Pickford to direct Rosita (1923), one of her efforts to adopt a more
mature screen persona. Lubitsch credited Chaplin's A Woman of
Paris as inspiration for a series of films that almost formed a sub-
genre on their own— comedies of manners with European
settings, produced by an emerging new company, Warner
Brothers. These included The Marriage Circle (]924) and Lady
Windermere's Fan (1925), the latter with very few intertitles, con-
veying playwright Oscar Wilde's epigrammatic wit through
gesture and expression rather than words.
Romantic Drama
Europe was also the setting, and often supplied the performers, for
romantic dramas set in the past— if far back enough in the past,
they became romantic costume dramas, or historical romances,
or, with sufficient swordplay, "swashbucklers." These were often
the occasion for heroics by male stars such as Fairbanks and
Valentino, but the genre received
its greatest boost with the arrival
in 1925 of Swedish actress Greta Garbo (1905-1990), with a
contract from M-G-M. She brought to the screen an intensity in
performing erotic passion that American cinema had rarely seen
before. In her third Hollywood film. Flesh and the Devil (]927),
she was paired with M-G-M star John Gilbert (1897-1936),
and their well-publicized off-screen romance heightened interest
in their on-screen love scenes.

War Films
Nearly a decade passed after the end of World War
I before a
genre began to take shape dramatizing and assessing the war
experience. Valentino's first starring role in The Four Horsemen of
the Apocalypse (1921
) had dealt partly with the war, but the film
industry shied away from the subject (as
it did with the Vietnam
War half a century later) until the success of the Broadway play
What Price Glory by Maxwell Anderson and Lawrence Stallings
in 1924. M-C-M hired Stallings to write the story for a war movie,
The Big Parade (1925). Directed by King Vidor (1894-1982), this
tale of lost innocence, with
its epic battle scenes and bittersweet
romance, established the recently merged studio and became the
formative work of the genre.
Horror
The horror genre during the 1920s was largely the province of one
performer, Lon Chaney (1883-1930), known as "The Man of a
118

Thousand Faces." For The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) he
wore a painful harness to create the grotesque posture of his char-
acter, Quasimodo. His most famous performance was in the first
film version of The Phantom of the Opera (1925), where again he
endured hardships in creating the gruesome face of the disfigured
phantom. Both works were made at Universal; though Chaney
left
the studio for M-C-M after The Phantom, Universal built on these
early silent triumphs to become a leading producer of horror films
in the sound era.
Melodrama
Dancing Mothers (1926), a Paramount picture directed by Herbert
Brenon
( 1880-1958), was one of a number of "society" melodra-
mas of the Jazz Age that capitalized on the sensational aspects of
that period's changing social and sexual mores. Clara Bow (1905-
1965) plays a wealthy young woman who parties at the same

abroad.
Gangster Films
Contemporary societ\ also played a role in spawning a new type
of crime film, the gangster genre. These films responded to the
changes in urban crime as a result of the post-World War
I
amendment to the United States Constitution prohibiting the
manufacture, distribution, or sale of alcoholic beverages.
Prohibition fostered powerful criminal organizations that supplied
illegal liquor; their highlv publicized exploits found their way into
films in the later 1920s. The classic silent gangster film was
Underworld 0927), directed by Josef von Sternberg (1894-1969)
for Paramount. The director called
it "an experiment in photo-
graphic violence and montage."' Gangster films outnumbered
Westerns by the end of the decade.
Hollywood on Hollywood
If every film was in a sense reflexive of other films, there was,
finally in this partial survey of Hollywood genres of the 1920s, the
self-reflexive genre of films about Hollywood moviemaking. King

the end of the 1920s (long neglected, Michcaux's work has not
yet been fully catalogued). Though Micheaux and other black
filmmakers made entertainment films on the model of Hollywood
genres, the budgets for these works often came to less than a
week's salary for a Hollywood star. The films played
in black
neighborhood theaters in such cities as Chicago and Detroit.
BODY AND SOUL.
Few so-called race films have survived.
One that did, Micheaux's Body and Sou/ (1925), may have been
saved because
it stars the famous actor and singer Paul Robeson
(1898-1976).
It
is a complex and ambiguous work, and the extant
version may have been altered from the original because of
objections from censorship boards. Robeson play two roles, a
young woman's respectable fiance and a vicious ex-convict who
poses as a clergyman and commits rape and murder. Then the
evil preacher
is revealed as a dream figure in a nightmare of the
woman's mother.
Documentary Film
A different kind of alternative— with a different commercial out-
come— was the "documentary" filmmaking of Robert Flaherty
(1884-1951
). A miner, prospector, and explorer in northern
Vidor's Show Peop/e (1928) for M-C-M was a prominent exam-
ple.
It presented several of the significant codes of the genre,
particularly centering on the propensity of female stars to let suc-
cess go to their head and lose touch with their fans, with only the
benign guidance of producers to protect them from disaster.
No wonder producers invariably came out the good guys in
Hollywood self-reflexive films. The United States commercial cin-
ema had become,
in the final analysis, a producers' medium.
Except for the few directors and stars who retained control over
their own creative endeavors,
it was supervising businessmen
who decided what stories would be prepared for screen treat-
ment, who would work on them, how much would be spent to
produce them.
ALTERNATIVES TO
HOLLYWOOD
As a cinema culture, the United States was largely mesmerized by
the Hollywood monolith. Other forms of filmmaking were carried
on: educational films for classroom use, industrial films for train-
ing and promotion, films by government agencies on such
subjects as health or agricultural methods. Amateur "home
movie" filmmaking was getting under way by a small number of
enthusiasts who used newly developed hand-held professional
cameras. But these were regarded as narrow and specialized
activities unrelated to cinema as art and entertainment.
Black Filmmakers
The principal exception came in efforts by African-Americans,
fueled by mainstream cinema's discrimination and neglect, to cre-
ate a film culture for and about black people. The most sustained
achievement in black cinema in the silent period came from nov-
elist and filmmaker Oscar Micheaux (1884-1951
), whose
companies produced several dozen fiction features from 1919 to
5.39.
Robert Flaherty's documen-
tary Nanook of the North (1922)
was a commercial and critical
success, especially in Europe, and
is regarded as a foundation work
of nonfiction film practice. In film-
ing the lives of Eskimo people in
northern Canada, however,
Flaherty was less interested in

recording what he witnessed than
in discovering a "true spirit" of a
people that may have been lost
through modern influence. To this
end he sometimes dressed his
subjects in old-fashioned cos-
tumes and had them reenact for
his camera traditional events that
they no longer practiced.
Canada, Flaherty had begun around 1913 to make films of Eskimo
life. In 1920, financed by a French fur-trading company, he
returned to the north to shoot a feature-length film on the theme
of the Eskimos' triumph of survival
in inhospitable conditions.
Flaherty sought a commercial distributor for the completed film,
Ncinook of the North (1922), and finally found one in Pathe

Exchange. No nonfiction film had received such wide theatrical
distribution since the earliest days of cinema, when actuality film-
making dominated the field. Nanook was greeted, particularly in
Europe, as a masterly depiction of a vanishing "primitive" way of
life. Yet Flahertv's notion of film documentary was not without
controversy. Rather than merely recording what he observed, par-
ticularly among native peoples whose lives had been altered by
European intrusion, he sought the "true spirit" of his subjects by
restoring old-fashioned costume and staging traditional events.
After Nanook, Famous Players-Lasky supported Flahert\
s next
documentary project,
in which he went to an opposite climatic
extreme, the Pacific islands of Samoa, to make Moana (1926).
However, Flaherty had a hard time persuading the distribution
company. Paramount, to release the film; ultimately
it was
released with the promotional
line, "The Love-Life of a South Sea
Siren." Hollywood companies occasionally produced nonfiction
films, though mostly for prestige purposes rather than from any
interest in encouraging alternatives to their standard products.
Flaherty tried to work within the Hollywood system for several
more years, without completing any films. His career resumed in
the 1930s when he went abroad and worked with funding from
British government agencies and film companies (see Chapter 11
).
Art Cinema
In the 1920s, primarily in Europe, film became regarded as a fresh
field of experiment for artists (see Chapter 6). The concept devel-
oped of an art cinema, separate from commercial production,
where a self-styled avant-garde sought to advance the medium by
creating new aesthetic forms, such as abstract images or nonnar-
rative works. In United States filmmaking, however,
it
is almost
impossible to speak of an art cinema apart from the commercial
film industry in the 1920s. One of the very few such films, and
perhaps the first, was the nine-minute work Manhatta (1921 ), by
the photographer Paul Strand (1890-1976) and the painter-
photographer Charles Sheeler (1883-1965). The film illustrated
verses from several Walt Whitman poems with images ot New
York City. Though not abstract, Manhatta attempted to convey a
mood rather than tell a story;
its high-angle shots of skyscrapers,
roofs, and pedestrians viewed from above communicate a sense
of the individual dwarfed by the city's cold immensity. A few
years later King Vidor's M-G-M fiction feature The Crowe/ (1928)
echoed Manhatta in
its opening sequence, with similar views of
the lower Manhattan skyline approached from the Staten Island
ferry and shots of the blank geometric windows of an office
building in which the film's protagonist toils amid vast rows of
desks.
More experimental films may have been made in Hollywood,
by otherwise commercial filmmakers trying out new techniques,
than outside
it. The most prominent was The Life and Death of
9413—A Hollywood Extra (1928), by Robert Florey (1900-1979),
a director born in France, and Slavko Vorkapich (1895-1976), a
Yugoslav film editor. In
its eleven-minute length
it displays a vari-
ety of artistic effects rarely seen
in standard Hollywood products:
expressionist sets (constructed as miniatures on table tops)
and skewed frame images in the Caligari manner; unstable
camera movements representing psychological states of mind;
Japanese-style theatrical masks; rapid editing without regard for
conventions of continuity.
Its theme
is the pathos of the Holly-
wood dream, as an aspirant to stardom gets a number written on
his forehead, fails to find work as an extra, succumbs, and
ascends to heaven, where his number
is removed.
Florey and Vorkapich's ambitions were not avant-garde but
mainstream like their subject's, and theirs came closer to fulfill-
ment. Because of their professional status, A Hollywood Extra
gained some commercial screenings. Florey was hired by
Paramount; at the New York-Astoria studio he codirected the first
Marx Brothers film. The Cocoanuts (1929), and went on to a long
career as a film and television director. Vorkapich worked in
Hollywood as a designer of special montage sequences (rapid
cutting and juxtaposition of images). Their cameraman, Gregg
Toland (1904-1948), became one of the movie industry's most
important cinematographers, and filmed Orson Welles's 1941
classic. Citizen Kane.
In
its own wav, Hollywood was also an innovator.
Its advances
were in the studio mode of production,
in promotion and market-
ing,
in the development of genres and the star system. These
made American movies a communications medium of unprece-
dented reach and power, a phenomenon to which man\ societies
and film cultures were forced to respond, with varying feelings,
from admiration to resentment.

S
I X
HE CINEMAS OF
T
Nowhere did the global cinema hegemony of the
United States come as a greater shock than in
Europe. Since the era of European expansion began
in the late fifteenth century with voyagers like Christopher
Columbus, Europeans had imposed their cultures on other lands,
not the other way around. Other peoples had become familiar
with the experience of cultural assimilation and domination;
when American movies became preponderant in their local movie
theaters,
it was merely another chapter in a long history. Even the
insular Japanese, cut off for several centuries from outside con-
tacts, had quickly proven themselves adept at incorporating the
new flow of western phenomena into their existing culture. Only
to Europeans, unaccustomed to receiving cultural products from
elsewhere on terms other than their own, was the dominance of
American movies seen as a crisis not only of cinema but of
civilization.
The issues were aesthetic, social, and economic. From the per-
spective of art, Europeans wondered whether American films
were intrinsically "better" than their own— whether Hollywood
products possessed a pace, rhythm, and narrative drive that
European cinemas could not match. From the perspective of soci-
ety, Europeans asked
if the popular appeal of American films was
a sign of cultural deterioration, of an emerging mass commercial
culture oriented toward proletarian and "feminine" values. And
from the perspective of economics, Europeans questioned
whether United States dominance was simply the outcome of
trade tactics that Europeans themselves had previously practiced
on other nations, such as cutting film rental prices below those of
local producers, or gaining control of distribution and exhibition
outlets.
Whatever the answers these questions evoked
in the immediate
circumstances after World War
I, from a longer historical perspec-
tive we can say with certainty that Europeans were not deficient,
compared to Americans, as filmmakers. The prominence that so
many Europeans attained in United States film production, begin-
ning with figures such as Alice Guy Blache and Maurice Tourneur
and continuing throughout the century, would suggest,
if any-
thing, their superiority. With the passage of time,
it has become
abundantly clear that the crisis of European cinema was not pri-
marily of filmmaking but of finances— of postwar weaknesses in
national economies that provided insufficient capital to support
domestic film industries. As had occurred earlier in countries such
as Australia and Brazil, motion picture executives who were
more interested in making money than making films found they
could profit more by importing American movies than producing
their own.
GERMAN CINEMA
To this broader pattern, which adversely affected filmmaking in
major prewar film-producing countries such as Denmark,
Italy,
and France, there was one notable exception: Germany. At the
beginning of the 1920s Germany possessed a well-organized film
industry which had been strengthened and strongly supported by
the wartime government and then passed into private hands.
Rampant inflation within Germany rendered that country unprof-
126

itable tor importers (the currency was constantly losing valuei but
also made German exports cheaper. Much as did the United
States. German\
built up
its film industry by aggressively export-
ing films, especially to Central and Eastern Europe. When
currency stabilization occurred in 1924, Germany's film exports
and overall film production weakened, enabling American films
and investments to make significant inroads in Germany as else-
where. Nevertheless, Germany continued to produce around two
hundred films a vear throughout the 1920s, several times more
than any other European nation, and maintain during most years
the leading position in
its home market.
The Weimar Era
Germany marks an exception also in the way historians periodize
the past. For film histor\' in general, the coming of sound in the
late 1920s designates a division between two eras. For the
German national cinema, however, the break is moved forward in
time to 1933, and made on political grounds:
it demarcates the
end of a distinct cinematic phenomenon associated with the rise
and fall of the German republic founded in the city of Weimar
after World War
I. Though not directK a state-controlled industry,
German film from 1919 to 1933, silent and sound,
is called
Weimar cinema.
Nevertheless, no matter how strongly Kracauer's book has been
questioned either on theoretical grounds or historical details,
its thesis has proven compelling. Because the crimes of the Hitler
regime were so horrific, the book leaves the impression that
filmmakers were blameworthy,
if for no other -eason than that
their works sensed and displayed the "deep psychological disposi-
tions" that were bringing fascism to power and yet they were
unable to resist
it. Other historians have gone even further, sug-
gesting that the German film industry "helped pave the way for
Hitler."-
This is a heavy burden for films to bear. Without denying that
films can have powerful ideological and emotional effects,
it
would be wise to think carefully through all the methodological
barriers to sweeping claims for their sp>ecific historical and politi-
cal impact. For example, since in the Weimar years foreign films
made up around half the total screened in German theaters, do
we conclude that foreign filmmakers must shoulder half the
blame? Puzzles such as this have led some historians, without
exactly repudiating Kracauer, to seek to change the terms of
understanding.
If we want to learn about how and why p>eople
make choices— or films— in a historical moment,
it
is fruitless to
analyze them on the basis of what was going to happen years in
the future.
EUROPE
FROM CALICARI TO HITLER. A film historv book pub-
lished
in 1947 by Siegfried Kracauer (1889-1966i encapsulated
the era and the conception in
its famous title: From Caligari to
Hitler. Kracauer's book
is perhaps unique in the annals of film
history. Since perspectives change, and new information
is con-
stantly unearthed about the past, few history books that are nearly
half a centun, old are widely read,
let alone hotly debated. Yet
this book remains at the center of any appraisal of Weimar cin-
ema. The author had himself been a film and cultural critic in the
Weimar era, but had fled Germany after the advent of Hitler's fas-
cist dictatorship in 1933. He spent the World War
II years in the
United States, writing,
in a new language, his history of Weimar
cinema.
It was subtitled A Psychological History ot the German
Film, and the issues
it raised continue to be of consequence for
the understanding not only of German cinema but of film as a
medium of communication in society.
FILM AMD NATIOMAL HISTORY.
Kracauer took as his
thesis the viewpoint that commercial films, because they are
made collaboratively to appeal to mass audiences, reveal more
effectively than any other medium 'deep layers of collective
mentality" in a nation. Thus the study of film exposes "deep psy-
chological dispositions" that led, in the Weimar period, to the
collapse of republican government and the onset of a totalitarian
regime.' To assess this argument fully would require almost a
book in itself— it goes well beyond the role of film in society to
include concepts argued over in cultural studies and psychology,
such as national character or the collective unconscious.
THE Kiso-DEBATTE. On these grounds, the interpretation of
Weimar cinema has shifted radicalK.
It becomes a cinema strug-
gling to establish
itself: as a commercial product differentiated
from popular American films, as an artistic endeavor worthy of
support from the nation's high culture establishment. This per-
spective emphasizes the Kino-Debatte—the debate over the
status of cinema among the arts—that took place in Germany
during the 1920s.
It also stresses the way films of the Weimar cin-
ema were shaped b\' the need to justify their artistic value for
aesthetic elites. Directors in Germany retained the autonomy as
independent artists that their Hollywood counterparts had lost.
Their films were much more strongly stylized— particularly
through cinematography and set design— than the standard
Hollywood product, and they aimed at a far more elevated, or
profound, viewpoint on history and human experience. Weimar
cinema was remarkably, in this interpretation, an "art cinema,"
directed to minority tastes in the face of the mass popular cinema
of Hollywood.
COMMERCIAL CULTURE.
Between the poles of Kracauer's
"collective mentality" approach and the thesis of Weimar cinema
as high art has emerged a third view: recalling that the German
cinema functioned fairly effectively as an industry, releasing two
hundred or more domestic products a year,
it seeks to place
German film production not only w ithin the context of mass psy-
chology or high art but in the framework of twentieth-century
commercial culture. From this perspective Weimar cinema
emerges as a film phenomenon with
its unique aesthetic and
127

national characteristics, yet also one not unlike many others—
a
film industry following accustomed distribution and reception
practices, seeking to build
its appeal on the familiar pillars of
genres and stars.
These debates over Weimar cinema suggest once again how
the past exists in fluid form, constantly altering
its appearance as
we interpret
it in new ways. In this rearrangement, one of the key
concepts that has fallen out of favor
is the notion that "German
Expressionism" can stand as an overall term to describe Weimar
films. The expressionist movement in painting, theater, and litera-
ture around World War
I (see Chapter 3) had made a sensational
cinematic impact in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, with
its distorted
sets and antinaturalistic performances. But only a handful of films
in the early 1920s carried their styiizations forward, and applying
the expressionist label too sweepingly to Weimar films can ham-
per a full sense of their relationship to the genres and intertexts of
international film culture.
STIMMUNC.
Like other cinema industries, Germany produced
its share of comedies, romances, melodramas, social dramas, and
historical epics. These films have captured critics' attention and
been included in the Weimar canon much less frequently than
works in genres regarded as more authentically German— films of
the fantastic, mountain films, street films, and Kammerspiel
(chamber films, or intimate dramas). These key genres are consid-
ered especially to convey the German preoccupation with
Stimmung— an emphasis on mood or feeling, especially of
melancholy.
It was this concern with mood that led German film-
makers to give extraordinary attention to lighting and design, to
communicate feelings through the play of space and light in the
mise-en-scene. After the nucleus of Weimar cinema's creative
talent dispersed— in the 1920s lured by Hollywood, after 1933
exiled by Hitler—what remained as
its legacy to world cinema
was this concern for a charged and often disquieting visual
atmosphere.
German Film and Filmmakers
Categories and generalizations— particularly the perennial ques-
tion, how German
is
it?—tend to fade into the background when
confronted with the complexities of actual films. The work of Fritz
Lang
is a case in point. Lang's early 1920s films are intensely
associated with their time and place and have become classics of
cinema history; yet,
like many major works of the medium, they
are also fundamentally linked to the formulas of international pop-
ular culture. Reviewers in the United States trade paper Variety
were not entirely consumed by nationalist bias when they called
Lang's films "dime-novel stuff" made for "mass appeal."^
LANG AND VON HARBOU.
After completing the two-part
adventure film
Ttie Spiders, Lang worked for the remainder of his
Weimar career with scriptwriter Thea von Harbou (1888-1954);
they were married
in 1924. Their first significant collaboration was
Der mOde 7bd (literally "Weary Death," released
in English-
language versions as Destiny, 1921
).
In
its episodic structure and
bleak fatalism, this film considerably resembles Dreyer's Leaves
from Satan's Bool< (there
is a character. Death, who, like Satan
in
the Danish film,
is weary of the duty he must eternally perform).
Visually the film
is marked by exotic settings (depicting episodes
in Baghdad, Renaissance Venice, and China) created by two of
the Caligari designers, Walter Rohrig and Hermann Warm, along
with Robert Herlth.
Lang and von Harbou turned to contemporary times for Dr
Mabuse, der Spieler (Dr Mabuse, the Gambler, 1922). The film's
scenes of speeding cars and trains, nightclubs and gambling dens,
conveyed a sense of the hedonism, restlessness, and haste of post-
war Germany. Yet
it also utilized the conventions of prewar crime
serials,
like the French series Fantomas, with
its two-part structure
(each part to be shown on successive nights) and
its epic battle of
wits between an intrepid investigator. State Attorney von Wenk,
and an arch criminal, the rogue psychoanalyst Dr. Mabuse,
with many masks and a lust for power. An inside joke in the film
is this exchange,
in the English version's intertitles: "What
is
your attitude toward Expressionism, Doctor?" Mabuse answers:
"Expressionism
is a pastime— but why ever not? Everything
today
is a matter of just passing the time!"
Die Nibelungen (1924) was an ambitious effort by Lang and
von Harbou to retell the ancient Nordic legend of Siegfried that
composer Richard Wagner had used as the basis for his famous
nineteenth-century opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen (in the
original legend, the name Nibelungen refers to Siegfried's land,
his people, and his treasure). The film version differed markedly

narrative of the decline of the gods.
It was also made in two parts
for successive nights' showings: the first, Siegfried, carries the
legend to the hero's death;
in the second, Kriemhild's Rache
(Kriemhild's Revenge), the hero's widow wages an implacable
campaign to avenge his murder. The film
is one of the stunning
triumphs of mise-en-scene in Weimar cinema, a world of myth
created in geometric design— in architecture, costume, and cine-
matographic spectacle.
f.
w. MURNAU.
Along with Lang and Ernst Lubitsch (who
left for Hollywood in 1923), an important filmmaker of early
Weimar cinema was
F. W. (Friedrich Wilhelmi Murnau (1888-
1931). Although Lang and Murnau shared cinematographers and
designers, and von Harbou also wrote several Murnau films,
the two directors' styles were markedly different. Lang's early
films created a world of externals, of visual power; while
Murnau's films did not lack for aesthetic pleasures, they were
based far more than Lang's on character psychology, on interior
states.
Murnau's first major work, Nosferatu (19221, a horror film about
the legendary vampire (drawn from Bram Stoker's novel Dracuia),
plays down the supernatural visual possibilities in favor of a focus
on the subtleties of human desire. The cinematography by Fritz
Arno Wagner (1894-1958), who also filmed Lang's Destiny,
is
surprisingly realist in style considering the subject, with a substan-
tial part of the work shot outdoors and on location. Though there
are moments of expressionist stylization
in decor and camera
angles (and in the cadaverous appearance of the vampire himself,
portrayed by Max Schreck [1879-1936], with bat ears and
grotesque curled fingersi, the film's horror derives much of its
power from
its setting in daily
life.
The basic Dracuia narrative
is familiar enough from having
been retold scores of times in the movies, with every imaginable
variant. Murnau's earliest version, in
its ambiguous treatment of
desire and evil,
in
its knowing simplicity, retains a startling power.
After the vampire has traveled to meet her, spreading plague and
death as he goes, the virtuous Mina reads in The Book of the
Vampire that "A woman pure in heart must offer herself to Nos-
feratu" (in the subtitles of the English-language version), and she
does so. The vampire comes to her, and at morning's light we see
him crouched by her lifeless body, his fangs by her throat, sated.
Too late, he realizes he has exposed himself to sunlight. Rising to
leave, he clutches his heart, and disappears in a puff of smoke.
His longing makes the vampire paradoxically more sympathetic
than the normal, rational characters, and the tryst between Mina
and Nosferatu appears a fulfillment of each one's desire and a
tragic end for both.

No countries with populations so small,
British film historian Forsyth Hardy wrote
in the early 1950s, had made so great a
contribution to world cinema as Sweden
and Denmark (and this was before
Sweden's ingmar Bergman became
famous as a leading director of interna-
tional art cinema). Denmark's Nordisk
company was one of Europe's leading
film producers before World War
I (see
Chapter 3J. Carl Th. Dreyer of Denmark,
whose directing career covered six
decades, ranks among the most impor-
tant figures of film history, and his work
is
treated throughout this book. Danish
actress Asta Nielsen was a star of German
silent cinema; because German films of
the 1910s are so
little known, her fiery,
passionate performances have not
received sufficient recognition.
After World War
I the Swedish com-
pany Svensk Filmindustri, formed in 1919
from a merger of smaller firms, became
the major production center in the
Scandinavian countries. Swedish films
gained international stature through the
work of directors Mauritz Stiller (1883-
1928) and Victor Sjostrom (1879-1960).
Born
in Finland, Stiller began working in
Swedish films in his late twenties. His
principal films include Erotikon (1920), a
comedy of manners, and Cosfa Berlings
saga (known in English as The Story of
Costa Berling or The Atonement of Costa
Berling, 1924). The latter film marked
Greta Garbo's second screen appear-
ance, and Stiller became her mentor.
They went to Hollywood together in 1925
with contracts from M-G-M; whether the
studio hired Stiller only to secure Garbo,
or whether the actress was signed at the
director's insistence, has been a matter of
conjecture ever since. Stiller was able to
finish only one film. Hotel Imperial (1927,
for Paramount), before returning to
Sweden, where he died in 1928.
Sjostrom began directing in 1912 and
also performed
in both his own films and
those of other directors. Two of his early
Swedish films continue to circulate
widely: Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru (lit-
erally "Berg-Ejvind and His Wife," known
in English as The Outlaw and His Wife,
1918), filmed on location
in rugged
mountain terrain and admired for
its real-
ism, and Korkarlen (literally "The
Coachman," known in English as The
Phantom Chariot, 1921).
Sjostrom went to Hollywood in the
1920s and adopted the name Victor
Seastrom; he directed several notable
films, including The W/nc/ (1928) with
Lillian Gish (see Chapter 8). Returning
to Sweden
in 1930, he worked thereafter
mainly as an actor. His last film appear-
ance was in Bergman's Smultronstallet
(Wild Strawberries, 1957; see
Chapter 15).

In 1924 Murnau directed Der letzte Mann (literally "The Last
Man," but given the English-language title The Last Laugh).
Though not the first,
it was the most famous Weimar silent film to
appear without intertitles (in some versions circulating in the
United States a single intertitle has been added, which has con-
fused some commentators into thinking
it appeared in the
original*. Some earlier works in the Kammerspiel genre also went
without titles. The rationale was that in this intimate genre charac-
ters' feelings were conveyed most subtly through performance
and visual effects. These included two films of 1921, Die Hinter-
treppei Backstairs) directed b\ Leopold Jessner (1878-19451 and
Scherben {Shattered), directed by Lupu Pick (1886-1931
). All
three titleless films were made from scripts bv Carl Mayer, the
most important screenwriter of the Weimar cinema, who had also
coauthored the script for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.
The Last Laugh concerns an aging doorman at a posh hotel
who
is demoted to washroom attendant when he
is unable to
handle a heavy trunk. Back in his working-class apartment house
his fancy uniform had been the source of his dignity and vanity,
and
its loss marks a crushing blow to both.
"A non-German mind
will have difficulty in comprehending all
its tragic implications,"
Lotte Eisner wrote in her studv of Weimar cinema. The Haunted
Screen.^ Tragedv or not. The Last Laugh was rather mitigated by a
fantasy ending,
in which the defrocked doorman becomes fabu-
lously rich because an "eccentric American multimillionaire" (so
described in a newspaper article that serves in place of an inter-
title) dies in the hotel washroom and bequeaths his fortune to the
last person who attended him.
The Last Laugh
is regarded as among the greatest of Weimar
silent films not for its unique "German tragedy" or its ironic/
upbeat commercial ending, but as a cinematographic tour de
force.
If Caligari's sets and performances were indeed expressions
of a national aesthetic style. The Last Laugh was less "Germanic"

Far from being incomprehensible to non-German minds, The
Last Laugh heralded a new presence for German films in interna-
tional cinema. By the mid-1920s, the novelty of American cinema
had become routine. Of Variete {Variety in the United States,
Vaudeville in Britain, 1925), a love triangle story among trapeze
artists, by the German director E. A. (Ewald Andre) Dupont (1891-
1956), the American critic Harry Alan Potamkin could write that
it
"burnt
its way through these United States and came near demor-
alizing the matter-of-fact technique of Hollywood," because of its
remarkable cinematography. This was again the work of Karl
Freund, shooting the narrative's high-platform acrobats, as Potam-
kin wrote, "from above, or from a corner, or from beneath, or from
whatever point of view was demanded"— even from a camera
mounted on a high swing.'
Hollywood was not totally demoralized;
it simply intensified
its
importation of German film talent. Murnau and lannings went to

Germany in 1929, after winning the first Oscar for best actor from
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for perfor-
mances in The Way of All Flesh (19271 and The Last Command
(1928). Murnau died prematurely in an auto accident. After a dis-
tinguished career in film, Freund went into early commercial
television, and was the cameraman on Lucille Ball's classic com-
edy series "I Love Lucy."
FRENCH CINEMA
The circumstances for French film culture after World War
I were
fundamentally different from those in Germany. Where Germany
had developed
its film production during the war, France had
essentially sacrificed the world's leading film industry to the war
effort. American films had flooded in and, despite some grum-
bling, generally enthralled both popular audiences and
intellectuals. After the war, the French almost had to rethink their
cinematic goals from the ground up. Should they make films like
FHollvwood's, or strive for something specifically French? Should
films be long or short, popular or for an elite? All these options,
and others, were tried out during the 1920s,
in a period of con-
stant change and experimentation
in French film. Throughout the
decade, France managed to produce roughly one-fourth the num-
ber of films made in Germany.
What was unique in postwar France was the richness of cultural
life surrounding the cinema. Because of the need to reestablish
cinematic institutions, as well as an early recognition of the
importance of cinema to other arts, intellectuals and artists in
France became much more involved
\\ ith film than elsewhere.
Film journals sprang up; cine-clubs formed to screen movies, hear
lectures, and participate in the development of the medium.
Critics became filmmakers, filmmakers became theorists, theorists
became critics, in a fluidity of roles and interests few other coun-
tries could match. In the United States similar activities barely
existed.
In Germany they centered on the /C/no-Debaffe about
film's status among the arts. In France, critics and theorists com-
mitted to cinema had no doubt about
its potential as art, and
debated
its characteristics.
Photogenic
A key concept in the emergence of French film criticism was pho-
togenie— a word with broader connotations than
its nearest
English equivalent, photogenic. The term was coined by Louis
Delluc (1890-1924), regarded as the leading critic of the period,
as well as an emerging filmmaker before his untimely death.
Other important filmmaker-critics who contributed to the theory
and practice oi photogenie included Jean Epstein i1897-1953).
Marcel L'Herbier (1888-1979), and Cermaine Dulac (1882-1942).
One might think of the term as defining a dialogue between the
cinematic apparatus and the actual world. Cinema stylizes actual-
ity, in this concept, and transforms our perception of
it, without
altering actuality itself.
It takes the real world and through cine-
matic techniques such as framing (what one chooses to include
within the image frame and leave outside
it), the close-up, and
editing, makes
it appear differently— imbued with new mystery
and beauty.
As may be suspected from these definitions, French critics of
the photogenie persuasion considered The Cabinet ot Dr. Caligari
a false step in cinema.
Its expressionist-style sets and performance
style they regarded as untrue to actuality; the camera had not
been permitted to fulfill
its function of transforming the actual,
it
merely recorded a staged event. These critics also faulted French
commercial cinema for,
in their view, emulating theatrical con-
ventions. What mattered to them, above all, was movement.
Cinema must be visual, wrote Germaine Dulac, even
if that
sounded redundant. The trouble was that films gave too much
attention to dramatic action, when they should be focusing on
"the value of the image and
its rhythms.'"'
Cinegmi^^hie
The momentum of this tendency in critical thought soon carried
it
away from the dialogue between cinema and actuality, and
toward a concern with the properties of cinema
itself— from
photogenie to cinegraphie. The new theme took one of two
directions: toward a "poetic" cinema, the "pure" movement of
images irrespective of content or story; or toward the utilization
of technique to express interior states otherwise unviewable in the
actual world. Both of these interests came to be associated with
avant-garde cinema, though
it
is worth noting that in the fluidity
of French cinema practice of this period several films now
regarded as avant-garde were produced and exhibited
commercially.
This overall movement in French filmmaking and cinema theory
has traditionally been known as French Impressionism, as a
handy distinction from German Expressionism and also to associ-
ate its principles with the nineteenth-century Impressionist
aesthetic
in painting. But as Expressionism has fallen out of use as
an overarching label for Weimar cinema, so too should
Impressionism be used only with caution to define this aspect of
French films. As early as the mid-1 920s such distinctions had been
erased by German films such as The Last Laugh and Variety, in
which the use of the camera to create images simulating charac-
ters' altered states of perception closely resembled what has been
called French Impressionism. Ironically, these German films
gained more credit for this style than did the French in the interna-
tional marketplace.
Most films of the French avant-garde, however, were not com-
peting in the international film market. What gives them a special
interest
is the fact that they were made by the first group of men
and women who thought and wrote about film, and then sought
to put their ideas into practice as filmmakers. Some of the films
have been dismissed by critics because they fail to fulfill the elab-
orate prescriptions of the filmmaker's theories, but this view
sometimes does injustice to films that have intrinsic value.
Fi EVRE.
Delluc's f/evre ("Fever," 1921
), for example, hardly
matches some of his critical flights of rhetoric about photogenie,
yet
it
is an intense short narrative film of considerable power.
Sailors returning from a voyage tumble into a rough waterfront
bar, attracting a bevy of prostitutes and setting in motion a highly
charged conflict of desire among a sailor; the barmaid, his former
girlfriend; his Asian wife, whom he married (flashbacks tell us)
after she nursed him through an illness; and the bar owner. With
its waterfront setting and exotic Asian character, the film echoes
Broken Blossoms, and
it resembles a Hollywood Western in
its
final sequence of a vicious fight, where the sailor
is killed and the
barmaid unjustly arrested. Throughout the violence the Asian
woman yearns to reach a flower which, when she gets to
it, turns
out to be artificial.

LA SOURIANTE MADAME BEUDET. Among this group of
early films, the one that has entered the film history canon most
centrally
is Dulac's La Souriante Madame Beudet (The Smiling
Madame Beudet, 1923). This
is in part because of feminist schol-
arship's interest in films by women, but Dulac and her film are
sufficiently important without special categorization. Based on a
stage play, the twenty-five-minute film chronicles the unhappy
marriage of a provincial bourgeois wife both by observing her and
by constructing her interior
life. She passes the time by playing
the piano and reading; as she turns magazine pages, photographs
become fantasy images— a car passing over clouds, a tennis
player come to
life. Her husband, depicted often
in tight close-up
with a loutish smile, has the habit of putting an unloaded revolver
to his temple when she vexes him. Unbeknownst to him, she puts
bullets in the gun, but this time he aims at her when he pulls the
trigger. The shot misses, and they briefly regard the horror of their
estrangement. The film's final shot—the couple in overcoats on a
winter day, backs to the camera, walking slowly uphill past a
priest— is an apt exemplar of photogenie,
in the pathos of its
simplicity.
LA ROUE.
Alongside these small, intimate films was a work
that by
its scope and aesthetic ambition was seen to stand as a
landmark in French cinema— a landmark, unfortunately, much
like the films of von Stroheim in the United States. This was La
Roue ("The Wheel," 1923), directed by Abel Cance (1889-1981 ),
who had been working in the commercial film industry since the
early 1910s but was consistently interested
in experimenting with
film form. The premiere screening of the film ran for nine hours
over three days. This complete work apparently made
it into gen-
eral release, but soon afterward the director edited a condensed
version, and over the years the original was lost and a variety
of shorter prints made their way into archives. The print circulat-
ing in the United States
is approximately three and one-half
hours long.
Cance spent nearly a year shooting La Roue, almost entirely on
location.
Its narrative concerns the fate of a train engineer,
Sisif,
and his two children, an artistic boy who makes violins and a girl
whom he rescued as a baby from a train wreck. From surviving
prints
it
is perhaps impossible to recapture the excitement con-
temporaries felt for the film.
It seems a cumbersome amalgam of
Griffith-style sentimentalism (the girl's blond hair made into a
halo by backlighting) and windy philosophy (the wheel as
life
symbol). Yet there are gritty working-class scenes of railyards,
combined with what the critics admired most, "poetic" moments
of montage showing the rhythm and movement of steam locomo-
tives. In a way La Roue remains most fascinating as a work that
evokes the importance of the steam engine and the railroad for
early cinema and industrial culture.

Surrealism and Film
These eruptions of "pure" imagery in Cance s iiim inspired ihe
cinematic avant-garde. A new aspect was the advent of filmmak-
ing by Surrealist artists. Since Surrealism, at
its most basic level,
wanted to undermine the concepts of everyday reality, the
Surrealists found the techniques of cinema ideal for their cause:
the film image could be made to defy conventional reality in
innumerable ways, as trick films had demonstrated from the earli-
est products of the medium.
REn( CLAIR. Among the first films associated with Surrealism
was Pans qui dorM literally "The Paris That Slept," but titled in
English-language versions The Crazy Ray, 1924), directed by Rene
Clair (1898-1981
).
It tells a droll story about a scientist's "ray" that
has frozen people in their tracks; what
is "surreal"
is not so much
its style as
its vision of a normal world radically altered. When a
group of otherwise respectable people discover that they have
escaped the ray's effects, for example, they go on a crime spree.
Clair's fnfr'acfelalso 1924) was a short film originally made to be
screened at a ballet performance; what we now know as a single
film was first shown in two parts, one as a prologue to the ballet
137

and the other between the first and second acts (the title means
"intermission," or literally, "between the acts").
Its Surrealist aim
was again disorientation,
in a raffish comic way. Utilizing fast and
slow motion, stop-action animation of inanimate objects, and
other elements of trick cinematography dating back to Georges
Melies, Entr'acte turned primitive cinema into avant-garde art.
and moving camera shots, superimpositions, and dissolves from
scene to scene that seem to defy conventional continuity; a cen-
terpiece
is a remarkable montage sequence that intersperses
images of time, speed, and the human body. Menilmontant
achieves Louis Delluc's theoretical goals for cinema as completely
as any other film of the era.
MENILMONTANT.
Important contributions to the French
avant-garde also came from Russian artists who emigrated to Paris
after the 1917 revolution. Menilmontant {)926), directed by
Dimitri Kirsanov (1899-1957), was linked to Delluc's Fievre
through
its working-class milieu, brutal violence, and symbolic
use of artificial flowers. Within a realist narrative concerning the
lives of two sisters in the Menilmontant district of Paris,
it displays
a full range of avant-garde techniques, particularly rapid cutting
INTERNATIONAL CINEMA
The presence of Russian emigre filmmakers in Paris was one of
many signs in the mid-1920s of an expanding international circu-
lation of images and styles. Earlier in the decade, the political
passions of World War
I and the reaction to Hollywood's postwar
domination had fueled an emphasis on cinema's importance to
national cultures. While this concern continued to be debated,

filmmakers found
it increasingly necessary to cross national bor-
ders, or draw financing, personnel, or inspiration from elsewhere.
Not all the talent fled to Hollywood: Germany, as well as Paris,
attracted aspirants like the young British film worker Alfred
Hitchcock, who went to Munich to develop his craft.
Germany
The German film industry was itself going through changes, as the
stabilization of its currency in 1924 set off a crisis. With exports
falling and imports rising, film companies facing financial losses
found support in Hollywood, but naturally with strings attached.
Ufa, the large production-distribution company set up during
World War
I (see Chapter 3), received a substantial loan from
Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
In return, the three com-
panies set up a new distribution subsidiary, Parufamet, whose
main purpose was to increase American film imports to Germany.
This and similar deals upset people who wanted films to portray
German national characteristics, and they bought out American
interests in 1927.
FA UST.
Several major films of the period were underrated, at
least in Germany, because they were regarded as culturally more
hybrid than national. Murnau's last German film before his depar-
ture to Hollywood, Fausf (1926), was planned by Ufa with a
strong international flavor. The studio cast a Swedish actor, Gosta
Ekman, as Faust; a French actress, Yvette Guilbert,
in a supporting
role; and unsuccessfully sought Lillian Gish for the part of
Gretchen. Though subtitled "A German Popular Legend," the film
closely follows (without acknowledgment) the version most
Europeans knew best, French composer Charles Fran(;ois
Gounod's nineteenth-century opera. Unmistakably familiar in the

Though Ufa
(Universum Film Aktiengesell-
schaft) operated one of the largest
studios in Europe during the
1920s, the German company was
more significant as a distributor
than as a producer This imposing
complex in Neubabelsberg, out-
side Berlin, began in 1911 as a
studio for the Deutsche Bioscop
company. Ufa was founded in
1917 with financial support from
the German government, became
private in 1918, and began
absorbing smaller firms. Ufa
moved to Neubabelsberg in
1923, when
it took over Decla
Bioscop, which had produced
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and
Fritz Lang's early films there, and
enlarged the studio, as pictured

1928).
These critiques are certainly pertinent, but
in the sweep of cin-
ema history they appear to miss the point. Films can indeed
espouse a philosophy, an ideology, a political theory, but many
of the greatest films are less likely to be paragons of narrative
coherence than they are to be triumphs of spectacle and mise-en-
scene. They communicate through the feelings evoked by their
visual power rather than by logic. This
is the case with Metrop-
olis. Long after one has dismissed
its narrative banalities,
its
powerful images remain: the fabulous city and the horrendous
machinery, run by clocks and steam, for which the workers
function as changeable parts.
Metropolis is the prototype of cinema's science fiction explo-
ration of humanity's place in the modern scientific/industrial
system. A scientist, Rotwang, played by Rudolf Klein-Rogge
(1888-1955), who also portrayed Dr. Mabuse (and who was
married to Thea von Harbou before her marriage to Lang), has
constructed a robot. "Now we have no further use for living work-
ers," he says;
it
is "a machine which no one will be able to tell
from a human being." The Master of Metropolis, a soulless engi-
neer rather than a greedy capitalist, orders the scientist to make
over the robot in the image of Maria; rather than urge the work-
ers toward peaceful change, as the saintly young woman had
done, the robot-Maria will incite violence that will lead to their
destruction.
The two Marias—the ethereal human, the demonic robot
were both portrayed by eighteen-year-old Brigitte Helm ib. 1908)
in her first screen role. They are perhaps the most striking elabora-
tion
in Weimar cinema of the theme of the Doppelganger or
"double," the divided self, which appeared frequently in German
literature and theater; another notable example was Der Student
von PraglThe Student of Prague. 1926), directed by Henrik
Galeen (1882-1949), which was a remake of a 1913 film of the
same title. In Metropolis, the radical opposition of the two Marias

has become the focus tor analyzing the film's complex interplay
of sexuality and technology, gender and ideology. Metropolis has
gained in stature as
its vision continues to resonate over the
decades, both
in cinema and society.
Neue Sachlichkeit
The technological concerns of Metropolis were one sign of a cul-
tural change in Weimar Germany and
its films in the mid-1920s.
This shift has often been described as a movement from Expres-
sionism to Neue Sachlichkeit— rendered
in English usually as
New Objectivity, an emphasis not on mood and feeling, as in
Expressionism, but on function and technique. New Objectivity
is
too sweeping a term to define a new era of Weimar cinema, just
as Expressionism was too broad for the earlier period. But cer-
tainly a new stress on realism in the cinema became evident.
C. w. PABST. A leading figure in the realist trend was C. W.
(Georg Wilhelm) Pabst (1885-1967). An Austrian like Lang, Pabst
also began his career as a film director in Berlin. His first major
work was Die freudlose Casse
( The Joyless Street, 1925), a melo-
dramatic street film with Swedish actress Greta Garbo and Asta
Nielsen (1881-1972), the Danish performer who was Weimar cin-
ema's leading female star. Pabst became a principal director of
contemporary social dramas. For his Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney
(The Love ofJeanne Ney, 1927), concerning Russian revolutionar-
ies in Paris, cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner contributed
exceptional moving camera work in exterior locations, as he had
done on Murnau's Nosferatu.

Box, 1928), was a treatment of sexual psychology based on the

As a concept in film history, "national
cinema"
is simultaneously inevitable and
questionable. Films, film technology, and
filmmakers crossed national borders from
the first moments of the medium. Yet
many governments also regarded cinema
as a kev instrument of national communi-
cations, and filmmakers themselves often
worked within the context of national tra-
ditions, debates, and movements in other
art forms. In principle a supranational
medium,
in practice filmmaking was
helped or hindered by state policies and
by local economic and social conditions.
Italian film in the 1920s provides an
intriguing case study for the idea of
national cinema.
Italy's films had been
among the world's leaders before World
War
I, in both stylistic innovation and the
international marketplace. Numerically
production continued to rise during and
after the war, reaching a peak in 1920.
Then things fell apart. By 1927 only about
a dozen feature-length films were pro-
duced. "The twenties were the most
pathetic decade in Italian film history,"
film historian Elaine Mancini has written.
"The industry lacked imagination, energy,
and contact with
its public:
it became
overcrowded with speculative companies
that closed one after the other, often
without producing anything; and
it
insisted on making films in the same style
and usually with the same techniques of
the earlier decade."
The specific causes of this sorry state,
however, are not always easy to identify.
Surely the social and political turmoil sur-
rounding the Fascist seizure of power in
1922 played a role.
It disrupted financing
and
left the film companies uncertain
about their cultural role, which con-
tributed to their failure to innovate in style
or technique. In a situation of stagnation
talent fled to Berlin and Paris; the most
prominent film made by an Italian abroad
was Prix de Beaute ("Beauty Prize,"
1930), directed in France by Augusto
Genina (1892-1957), with a screenplay
by Rene Clair and G. W. Pabst and star-
ring Louise Brooks. By the late 1920s the
Fascist regime had begun to develop film
policies that slowly began to revive Italian
production
in the 1930s (see Chapter 10).
British cinema was also in a bad state
during the 1920s. In 1926 only 18 British
films were released by major distribution
companies, out of a total of 580. A con-
temporary critic, C. A. Lejeune, wrote in
1931, "The British cinema has been hand-
icapped in every way— with bad brains,
shortage of money, lack of confidence,
injudicious flattery, misdirected talent,
unfortunate legislation." As in
Italy, the
particular combination of difficulties led
to a stylistic and technical conservatism.
The answer to a national cinema's
problems was often found in cinema's
internationalism. Talent went abroad to
learn, as Alfred Hitchcock did to
Germany, and then returned; talent from
abroad saw the opportunity and came to
seize
it, as was the case with Hungarian
producer-director Alexander Korda, who
arrived in London by way of Berlin,
Hollywood, and Paris. Hitchcock and
Korda were among the leaders of British
cinema's recovery in the 1930s (see
Chapter 10).

expressionist dramas. For his Lulu, the director sought a performer
who could portray not the playwright's sexual temptress, but a fig-
ure whose tragedy derives from an innocent, natural sexuality. He
persuaded the young American actress Louise Brooks
(1906-1985) to come to Berlin, and their collaboration was to
become a legend
in film history, for the riveting power of her per-
formance as Lulu and for the transgressive sexual subject matter
of the film.
With her signature cap of shiny black hair, cut in bangs low on
her forehead, Brooks's Lulu was memorable in Pandora's Box pre-
cisely for her childlike spirit, her loose-limbed movement, her
sexual ease and freedom. These qualities, however, were contra-
dicted by the desires of others and the pressures of bourgeois
society. At the end, poverty-stricken
in London, her father sends
her out to prostitution because he wants to eat a Christmas pud-
ding. She meets Jack the Ripper, and
it
is now her desire, perhaps
unconsciously, to end her travail that lures the murderer to
his task.

THE PUNISHMENT
OF WOMEN
Central to the circulation of images during this period, clearly, was
the issue of representing, and constructing narratives about,
female sexuality. Critical scholarship in recent years has devoted
intense theoretical debate to questions concerning the male gaze,
to which women are subjected. But perhaps more attention ought
to be paid to the physical punishments that women are made to
suffer in the films.
In Faust, Cretchen
is accused of killing her baby and
is burned
at the stake;
in Metropolis, robot-Maria
is set on fire as the work-
ers cry, "The witch! The witch!" Lulu encounters a notorious
murderer of women, and serial killings of women are also the
theme of Alfred Hitchcock's first British film as director. The
Lodger {^926), after he had directed two British-German copro-
ductions made in Munich. In The Lodger, the male protagonist
rents a room decorated with sentimental portraits of women. The
last one
is of a bare-breasted woman, guarded b\
a soldier, being
readied for burning at the stake.
Whatever the psychological, social, or aesthetic groundings for
such repeated aggressions, thev reach a culmination with Carl Th.
Dreyer's La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc {The Passion of Joan of Arc,
1928). The Danish director, who had worked in Sweden, Norway,
and Germany during the 1920s, as well as his native countrv, was
given a free hand by French producers to make a film about the
fifteenth-century saint. He brought in a German cinematographer
and designer and cast as Joan a stage comedv actress, Falconetti,
whose memorable performance was her only appearance on film.
Joan was condemned to the stake for theological and political
reasons, but Drever's film, particularly from an intertextual per-
spective,
is also powerfully about gender. The film
is an onslaught
of male oppression. Joan's interrogators are shot in tight close-ups,
from consistently low camera positions, emphasizing their loom-
ing, malign power. The spectator
is placed in the female position,
subjected to the male gaze— except that Joan's face in tight close-
up
is constantly intercut with the men, so the spectator
is
simultaneously in the position of oppressor. Constant pans and
dollies, off-center framings, figures rising into the frame, and the
claustrophobic tight framing of faces and parts of faces make The
Passion ofJoan of Arc one of the most emotionally intense and
visually rewarding works in cinema history.
The gender issues in these films make
it inevitable to ask the
question of cinema, who
is looking? The Surrealist film Un Chien
andalou ("An Andalusian Dog," 19291, made in Paris by the
Spaniards Luis Bunuel (1900-1983) and Salvador Dali (1904-
1989), opens with a notorious sequence depicting a man (Bufiuel)
slicing a woman's eye with a straight razor. This violent act marks
another culmination to a decade of European filmmaking—
a
provocation against the spectator, perhaps against a cinema turn-
ing from silence to sound, but inescapably also against a woman.

ET
Sov
Since the collapse and disappearance of the
Soviet Union as a political entity, perhaps the
most intriguing question
in cinema history
is
how the view of Soviet silent films may be trans-
formed. For most of the twentieth century, the film
practices fostered by the 1917 Bolshevik revolution
in Russia (and,
subsequently, other republics of the former Soviet Union) have
been regarded as one of the medium's grandest experiments. Out
of revolutionary ideology came an avant-garde movement whose
great works challenged and inspired filmmakers throughout the
world. Since that ideology has fallen into disrepute (and, even
more strongly,
its political institutions),
its achievements in the arts
will also inevitably be reexamined. What may help to preserve the
reputation of Soviet silent cinema, by tragic irony,
is that,
like so
much else,
it ultimately was crushed by postrevolutionary politics,
as bureaucracy inexorably triumphed over art.
As every aspect of the 1917 revolution and
its aftermath under-
goes new scrutiny, fresh perspectives on the history of cinema
in
the territories of the former Soviet Union have emerged.
Filmmaking in prerevolutionary Russia, for example, was a subject
long neglected,
if not suppressed.
It turns out to have been of sub-
stantial importance. At the time of the revolution some four
thousand movie theaters were operating in Russia. The French
company Pathe played a strong role in production and distribu-
tion, as in the United States, until the outbreak of World War
I.
Directors such as Evgeni Bauer (1865-1917) developed a
distinctive style featuring a carefully lighted and decorated mise-
en-scene, slow movement, and tragic endings. Following the
revolution many of the old companies moved from the capital,
Moscow, to southern Russia outside Bolshevik control, and con-
CINEMA
tinued to produce films until the early 1920s.
Although Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, was famously
quoted as saying, "Of all the arts, for us the cinema
is the most
important,"
it took several years for the new Soviet state to
develop policies and plans for the medium. The question of
whether control over cinema would be centralized or in local
hands was decided
in favor of nationalization, but that was also
slow in taking effect. One of the first concrete steps was to estab-
lish a state Film School
in Moscow, to replace the trained
personnel who had gone south. Lacking raw film stock (with
severe shortages, what was available went to make propaganda
films, not student work), faculty and students spent their time
theorizing about cinema rather than making films.
AGIT-TRAINS
The most important development for Soviet cinema
in the first
postrevolutionary years were the agit-trains. These were special
trains carrying agitational
(in the political sense, to present an
argument or sustain a viewpoint) and propaganda materials to
peasants in rural areas—there were also agit-trucks, an agit-ship,
and, for severe winter conditions, agit-sleds. They contained
newspapers, pamphlets, political speakers, and film equipment,
both to project films (for many agit-train audiences,
it was their
first experience of movies) and to record images and events.
The agit-train experience was crucial to the formation of a
Soviet cinema sensibility. Many of the future filmmakers went out
on the trains or worked as editors on the footage that came back.
Screening films outdoors under less than optimal conditions
emphasized the need for brevity, speed, and movement; back

the cutting room, the task of taking footage from man\ different
locations and melding
it together into a coherent newsreel or
documentarv stressed the importance of montage, the principle
that images communicate less in themselves than b\ their place-
ment and juxtaposition among other images.
LEV KULESHOV
The first important figure to explore these ideas was Lev Kuleshov
(1899-1970). He was eighteen vears old at the time of the
Bolshevik uprising—the revolution was, in effect, his university'
(nearly all the major Soviet filmmakers were under twent\'-five
during the formative period of political upheaval). The vear
before, when he was seventeen, the \oung art student had landed
a job as set designer with Evgeni Bauer. He also acted, completed
directing a film after Bauer's death, and directed one on his own.
When the old film companies left Moscou, Kulesho\ remained,
casting his future v% ith the revolution. He worked on agit-trains
and on agitkas, the films made for agit-train screenings. One of
the founders of the Film School in Moscow, he formed the
Kuleshov Workshop u ithin
it to work on cinematic theories
and techniques.
The Kuleshov Effect
In the workshop Kulesho\ developed his views on montage. He
took the position that the material of cinema was the celluloid
film strip— pieces of film. Film art consisted of putting these
pieces together to create, through montage and the spectator's
perception, a cinematic composition or idea. The legendary
Kuleshov effect was an illustration of this principle. The film
director V.
I. Pudovkin (1893-1953), then a student in the work-
shop, tells the story about how he and Kuleshov constructed a
film using a close-up of a famous Russian actor juxtaposed with
three different images— a bow
I of soup, a dead woman in a
coffin, a girl playing w ith a toy bear. Spectators, according to
Pudovkin, imagined that the actor was registering hunger touard
the soup, sorrow toward the coffin, jo\ toward the girl. But the
image was exactly the same all three times. The Kuleshov effect
thus describes a phenomenon whereb\ shots acquire their mean-
ing onlv in relation to other shots.
Still hampered b\' lack of film stock, the workshop also prac-
ticed performance exercises before an unloaded camera,
\s ith the
aim of de\eloping a direct, svstematic acting st\ le appropriate to
the brief shots of a montage-based cinema. Finally, after several
years, the newly formed state film organization Coskino offered
Kuleshov and his group a chance to make their first film. This was
the lengthiK' titled Neobvchainive priklucheniva Mistera Vesta v
strane bol'shevikov
i The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in
the Land of the Bolsheviks. 1924). As director, Kuleshov some-
what defensiveK admitted that this propaganda comedv was a
commercial and industrial product rather than a fulfillment of
their experiments and theories.

whatever significance the Bolshevik revo-
lution may come to hold
in world history,
it v^ill surely continue as an important
context for the early history of cinema.
Under the auspices of the revolution and
the state
it established, the Soviet Union,
a major film movement attempted to
forge a revolutionary aesthetic from a rev-
olutionary ideology. Many of its key films,
such as Eisenstein's October and
Pudovkin's The End of St. Petersburg,
celebrated the revolution
itself; others,
like Shub's The Fall of the Romanov
Dynasty, proffered historical justification.
Spectators of Soviet silent cinema need to
know something of the background of the
revolution and
its consequences.
The Russian Empire was a monarchy
whose emperor was known as the czar;
in 1894 the heir to the Romanov dynasty,
Nicholas
II, became czar. Throughout the
nineteenth century revolutionary move-
ments had sprung up among students and
intellectuals opposed to the autocratic
rule of Nicholas's predecessors. Among
the philosophies underlying these move-
ments, the theories of the German
socialist Karl Marx (1818-1883) became
increasingly important.
Marx, along with Friedrich Engels, had
written The Communist Manifesto foWow-
ing the failure of European revolutions in
1848. Later he wrote a three-volume
analysis of the capitalist system. Das
Kapital. In basic terms, Marx held that
history
is governed by laws which shape
economic development; that these laws
divide society into classes; and that the
injustices of capitalism would drive wage
laborers (the working class, or proletariat)
to overthrow the political system that sup-
ported capitalism and put in
its place a
"dictatorship of the proletariat." This
would wipe out capitalism's evils and
pave the way for a classless society,
called Communism.
After Russia suffered a major defeat in
war with Japan
in 1905, a revolutionary
uprising occurred that included the for-
mation of a soviet, or workers' council,
in
St. Petersburg. This revolution was
crushed (Eisenstein's The Battleship
Potemkin depicts one phase of
it), but a
radical left-wing group called Bolsheviks
("majority"), espousing Marxism, contin-
ued to advocate overthrowing the czar,
its leader, Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924),
spent the years from 1897 to 1917 in
exile.
When Russia entered World War
I in
1914, on the side of France and Britain
against Germany,
it again experienced
defeat and social unrest. In March 1917 a
workers' revolt in St. Petersburg deposed
Nicholas (who was later murdered with
his family) and led to the forming of a
provisional government. Returning from
exile, Lenin called for a "dictatorship of
the proletariat," and in October 1917 the
Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional gov-
ernment and seized power. With Lenin at
the head, the new regime in 1918 took
the name All-Russian Communist Party
(of Bolsheviks).
It faced several years of
civil war and,
in the early 1920s, dire
famine. In 1922 the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) was formed,
including non-Russian territories con-
trolled by the Communist party or
its
armies. This state dissolved in 1991 and
its republics became autonomous.
Moscow. "Bury those New York magazines and hang a portrait
of Lenin
in my office," Mr. West wires home. "Long live the
Bolsheviks."
Though not the first Soviet film, Mr West raised clearly for the
first time issues with which every state-controlled cinema has
since grappled: Should films made under state auspices aspire
to be art, ideology, or entertainment? To what extent are they a
society's showpieces for foreign consumption, or utilitarian
products for domestic audiences? Mr. West is a comedy that
provides ample pleasures and scores some broad political
points. But
it
is hardly a work to inspire and challenge
the world.
SERGEI EISENSTEIN
Inspiration and challenge were surelv among the goals of theater
director Sergei Eisenstein (1898-1948) when he turned to full-
time film work around the time of Mr. West. Within a few months
of their release in 1925 his first two films, Stachke {The Strike) and
especially Bronenosets Potemkin [The Battleship Potemkin), had
given notice to the world of an important new presence. These
were works that seemed to represent not onlv a personal triumph
but also a revolutionary art forged
in the aesthetic and ideological
ferment of the new Soviet state. Though Eisenstein was soon to
suffer the proverbial fate of prophets in their own countries, to
those elsewhere who followed cinema and the arts the Soviet
Union never had a more prestigious or persuasive ambassador.
152

Proletkult
Eisenstein's voluminous endeavors as the most important film the-
orist of his era mainlv came later in his career but even in his
earK theater work he was de\ eloping ideas that would have
impact on his films. When his training as an engineer was inter-
rupted by the revolution (he was nineteen), Eisenstein went into
militars service and eventually shitted toward the theater, working
as a designer for agit-train productions. He became associated
with Proletkult (the name stood for "proletarian cultural-educa-
tional organizations"!, a group advocating the de\elopment of a
new culture for the working classes. As designer, sometime actor,
and then director, Eisenstein worked on exp>erimental Proletkult
theater productions. One strand of his efforts drew on an antinatu-
ralistic "biomechanical" performance style, based on actors'
movements rather than expressions of feeling (later, in his film
work, Eisenstein preferred to cast "ordinars p>eople" as performers
rather than professional actors); another borrowed from popular
entertainments like the circus and pantomime.
Theory' ofAIontage
His first published essa\, "The Montage of Attractions" (1923),
though concerned w ith theater rather than film, related closely to
the cinematic debates of the period. Like Kuleshov, Eisenstein
emphasized the centralit\ of the spectator's response. He defined
"attraction" as whatever element of a production "that subjects
the audience to emotional or psychological influence"^ (his ital-
ics). The stress
is not on constructing a narrative or representing
the actual world but on creating a shock that leads to audience
perception and knowledge. In a sense Eisenstein's aesthetic
barkened back to primitive cinema, with
its pla\ of spectacle
rather than orderlv narrative progression.
As he shifted into filmmaking Eisenstein de\eloped and trans-
formed his montage theories. He placed greater emphasis on what
he called "intellectual montage,
' which built on the concept of
"attraction" but w hich aimed,
in the words of the French
Eisenstein scholar Jacques Aumont, at "a conceptual effect ... the
production of meaning."- Among the techniques he favored in
"intellectual montage" were svnecdoche (the part standing for the
whole) and metaphor (in his cinematic usage, the juxtaposition of
unrelated images to generate associations in the spectator's mind).
A famous example of montage as metaphor
is a sequence in
Okt\'abr' (October, 1928),
in which a shot of a soldier in a trench
is intercut with a shot of a tank rolling off an assembly line,
metaphoricallv shaping an intellectual perception that the soldier
is being tor will be) run over by the tank.
Eisenstein moved into film with a proposal from Proletkult to
the state film organization to make a series of seven films on
events leading up to the Bolshevik revolution, "Towards
Dictatorship of the Proletariat." The Strike and The Battleship
Potemkin developed from that plan. The first film vsas a Proletkult
project, but afterward the director and the group had an acrimo-
nious falling-out (ostensibly from a dispute over whether
Eisenstein should get a screenpla\
credit*, and future work went
forward with Eisenstein's own group of coworkers. His cinematog-
rapher Eduard Tisse (1897-1961
) and scriptwriter Crigori
Alexandrov (1903-1984i staved with him.
Still, nearly all the director's films of the silent era grew out of
this Proletkult concept
October, his third released film, was an
assignment to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the 1917
revolution. We might consider the significance of these historical
subjects, particularly from the viewpoint Soviet theonsts placed
such importance on, that of the audience. Eisenstein's historical
films were addressed foremost to Soviet spectators, as works of
interpretation and emotional reinforcement. "Proletarians,
Remember!" exhorts the final intertitle in The Strike, remember
how bad things used to be. They also spoke vividly to sympathiz-
ers elsewhere, who could be inspired to carr> on their own
struggles by visions of Soviet tribulations and triumphs. At the end
of the twentieth centur\, however, what remains of these films'
power?
It's unlikely that their director would have accepted the
idea that their art was separate from their ideology.
Perhaps the simple answer
is that Eisenstein's films, viewed at
far remove from their historical and contemporary struggles, both
gain and suffer from ideology. Writing his own critique of The
Strike some vears later, the director stressed how the film was
among the first to treat collective and mass action, to make the
mass rather than the bourgeois individual the hero. What
it failed
to do, he said, was show the development of the individual within
the collective. Only after the general image of the collective was
established as a screen subject, Eisenstein reflected, could this
deeper meaning be attained.
The Strike
This judicious perspective provides a framework for looking at
Eisenstein's first film. Indeed,
in The Strike the individual
is miss-
ing. There is no humanitv
in the capitalists' total villainy. Yet the
work well illustrates the theor\' of "montage of attractions."
It
invokes the spectator not through ston, or logic but through a
kind of dance of movement and form— movement of the mass
crowds in the mise-en-scene; movement of the camera particu-
larly as
it photographs inanimate objects; and movement of the
editing through rapid cutting, dissolves
editing two shots together
so that one fades while the other emerges', wipes
i editing so that
one shot appears to push another off the screen, double images
(printing one shot over another), irises (darkening part of the
image to reshape the frame and highlight one part of
iti, and such
trick devices as opening up one shot from the center of another
(an unusual kind of w ipei.
In another essav, written shortly after
completing The Strike, Eisenstein defended his controversial inter-
cutting of scenes of police shooting workers with shots of a bull
being killed in a slaughterhouse:
it was, he said, to avoid the false-
ness of human death on screen w hile fully signaling
its bloody
horror (thus, one might add, an early example of metaphorical
montage).
The Battleship Potemkin
The lessons of The Strike were applied immediatek
to The
Battleship Potemkin. Draw n from events that occurred during an
unsuccessful uprising against the Russian monarchy in 1905, the
film depicts a mutiny aboard a naval vessel. In the first of five sep-
arate parts, or "acts," entitled "Men and Maggots," individuals
were created among the sailors, and their discontent was made
human and immediate through the rotten food thev v\ere given
and their officers' crueltv and indifference. The mutinv
itself,
beginning on the ship's foredeck,
is choreographed intimately
rather than massivek, as were the events in The Strike. Though
filled with temp>orai leaps ("real time" becomes "reel time,
" and
can be lengthened or foreshortened for psychological effects) and
visual disjunctions, the editing stvie avoids The Strike's virtuoso

aimed to make collective action
rather than individual figures
its
focus. Though Eisenstein later
savif this approach as a drawback
(or at legist a necessary stepping
stone before individuals could be
shown developing out of the col-
lective). The Strike remains
notable for its remarkable chore-
ography of movement, performed
by actors from Moscow's First
Workers' Theater These shots

director shaped visual forms both
from active and static scenes.

display of effects for their own sake. Not much shorter in length
than The Strike, The Battleship Potemkin has the appearance of a
briefer, more direct work, moving forward tautly with an economy
that seems to absorb
its intricate and complex montage strategies.
ODESSA STEPS SEQUE\CE. The events culminate in the
Odessa Steps sequence, one of the most famous set-pieces in cin-
ema history. As the crowds in the port citv Odessa pour into the
harbor area to view the liberated battleship and mourn a dead
sailor, soldiers appear behind them and march down the steps,
firing their rifles. From the intertitle "Suddenly
.
.
." (in
English-language versions^, which introduces a shot of empty
steps and then soldiers' boots beginning their downward march,
the sequence lasts about tour minutes twenty seconds, and con-
tains approximately 155 separate shots. Though
it may appear a
welter of crowds and individuals, close-ups and long shots, move-
ment up and down,
in ever accelerating tempo, the sequence also
relies on specific narrative and character elements: the mother
whose son
is wounded and trampled, who picks up the child and
confronts the soldiers, only to be shot in cold blood; the mother
with the baby in a carriage, whose fall, after being shot in the
stomach, sends the carriage careening down the steps; the older
woman
in a white scarf and pince-nez glasses, who first proposes
appealing to the soldiers, then
is slashed
in the eye by a soldier's
saber.
The baby carriage segment perhaps deserves most detailed
scrutinv for a sense of Eisenstein's montage principles and editing
stvle. Strict temporality
is discarded. Separate shots of the carriage
wheels, ominously moving and then precariously stopped, are
intercut with the mother's fall, which
is itself presented in sepa-
rate, overlapping shots, elongating and repeating "real time." Over
the years The Battleship Potemkin has received many tributes and
homages from other filmmakers— for one HolK'wood example, a
careening babv carriage in a crucial sequence of Brian De Raima's
The Untouchables (1987i—but few have come close to matching
the intricacy and delicacy of Eisenstein's montage.
Octoher
At twenty-six, Eisenstein perhaps knew that The Battleship
Potemkin would be a hard act to follow. Preliminars work on a
contemporar\ film about Soviet agricultural policy was interrupted
by the assignment to make October ithe film has sometimes been
known in other countries by the title of John Reed's book on the
Bolshevik revolution. Ten Davs That Shook the Worldl More
ambitious in scope than Potemkin, the film inevitably became
caught up in the intense political struggles of the time. Following
Lenin's death in 1924, succession to his leadership was contested
by several factions. Around the time Eisenstein was completing
October, Joseph Stalin emerged as the new Soviet leader, and his
enemies and rivals, no matter how important they had been in the
157

7.10-7.12.
Eisenstein's visual
design for his film celebrating the
tenth anniversary of the Bolshevik
revolution, Oktyabr' COctober,
1928), included scenes of individ-
ual and mass action, of bourgeois
decadence characterizing the
provisional government that took
office following the workers'
uprisings of March 1917, and of
Vladimir Lenin's fiery oratory that
propelled the Bolshevik seizure of
power in October 1917. A man
named Nikandrov (whose first
name seems lost to history) was
selected to portray Lenin (top)
because of his resemblance to the
leader Of this controversial per-
formance the poet Vladimir
Mayakovski wrote, "Nikandrov
doesn 't resemble Lenin, but a
statue of Lenin.

revolution, had to be edited out of the finished filnn. Even for those
historical personages who remained in the film, controversy sur-
rounded their representation by actors. Despite
its dramatic events
and dynamic stylization, October at this distance seems static and
uninvolving.
The Old and the New
The agricultural film appeared in 1929 as Staroe
i novoe [The
Old and the New, also known by Eisenstein's working title. The
General Line). Political pressures also drove this film toward a
heroic treatment of a peasant woman who overcomes the hostility
and sabotage of ignorant neighbors to demonstrate the superiority
of collective farming and mechanized agricultural methods. One
of its anomalies for present-day spectators
is that when the heroine
succeeds in obtaining a tractor from a factory, this triumph of the
Soviet system turns out to be a Ford Motor Company product,
manufactured in the Soviet Union by the giant capitalist firm.
DZIGA VERTOV
Another view of cinema's role in Soviet culture came from Dziga
Vertov (1896-1954), the professional name of Denis A. Kaufman.
Vertov left medical school at the revolution to go into film work in
Moscow. He traveled on agit-trains and as a war correspondent,
and put together newsreels and documentaries from available film
footage. Where Kuleshov had gone from the agit-train experience
through film school teaching to fiction filmmaking, and Eisenstein
through theater to historical films, Vertov learned the creative
importance of film editing, and became a lifelong advocate of
the documentary film.
Kino-Pravda
Vertov entered the Soviet film debates of the early 1920s with vig-
orous attacks on fiction film. With his brother Mikhail Kaufman
(1897-1980) as cameraman and his wife, Elizaveta Svilova
(1900-1976), as coeditor, Vertov formed the Cine-Eye group. They
began producing a newsreel series called Kino-Pravda, named
after the official Soviet newspaper, Pravda (the term meant Cine-
Truth, and was revived decades later for the French documentary
film movement of the 1960s, cinema verite). More than twentv
Kino-Pravda episodes were released between 1922 and 1925.
In
his manifestos, Vertov called for an approach to montage that was
at once scientific and poetic, whose core lay in the organization of
movement into a "rhythmical artistic whole."'' That job belonged
to the film editor, who shapes the movement of the overall work
by determining the "intervals," Vertov's term for the transitions
from one image to another.
Vertov's sharp polemical pen earned him opponents as well as
supporters. He was criticized from many directions: for depriving
images of their status as documents; for using ineffective images
that needed more design and composition; for overemphasizing
intertitles; for attempting to monopolize the documentary field.
One who voiced this last critique was Esfir Shub (1894-1959),
whose career as a film editor and documentary filmmaker has
been largely eclipsed by Vertov's fame as a lone Soviet avatar of
nonfiction film.
In an era before archives and museums preserved
film materials, Shub hunted down discarded footage and put
together historical documentaries. In her first compilation film,
Padenie dinastii Romanovykh
( The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty,
1927), she crafted from what often appeared accidental or innocu-
ous images a compelling narrative of events leading up to the
abdication of the Russian monarch in February 1917. This was fol-
lowed by several similar works on Russian history and Soviet
life.
A Sixth Part of the World
Many of the attacks on Vertov found a focus in his 1926 feature-
length documentarv Shestaya chast' mira iA Sixth Part of the
World). This
is an unabashedly propagandistic work sponsored by
a Soviet trade agency. The spectator is continually addressed as
"you" and
is further positioned bv occasional shots of a movie
audience viewing the film's images on a screen. The film's unique-
ness, perhaps now difficult to appreciate, lay in
its sending
cameramen out to the far reaches of the Soviet north, east, and
south to capture images of non-Russian ethnic groups within the
vast Soviet territory'. Their efforts as hunters and farmers were pro-
ducing export goods, the film declared, to trade for machines to
build "A Model Homeland."
The Alan with the Alovie Camera
For the next several years Verto\ pla\ed a less prominent role in
the intensifying Soviet film debates. He and his Cine-E\e col-
leagues,
it turned out, were preparing a film intended as a visual,
rather than verbal, statement of their documentary- theories. This
was Chelovek s kinoapparatom
{ The Man with the Movie Camera.
1929), produced by a Ukrainian film organization. In the film's
opening credits Vertov proclaimed
it an experiment without
intertitles, script, actors, or sets: a work aimed "to create a truly
international film-language, absolute writing in film, and the
complete separation of cinema from theater and literature."
The Man with the Movie Camera
is one of the most unusual
works in cinema historv.
It
is also perhaps the most difficult of all
major films, almost certainly requiring more than a single viewing
to grasp some of its meanings and pleasures. A coherent summary
of all
it attempts to accomplish
is probablv next to impossible. But
many with an open mind toward the varieties of filmmaking and
an interest in the autonomy of the cinema image will find
it one
of their most memorable film experiences.
Presented on one level as a day in the life of a film team pho-
tographing places and people in Soviet cities. The Man with the
Movie Camera
is basicalK
a film about the recording and viewing
of images.
Its opening sequence establishes the beginning and the
end of the image-making process. A trick shot shows a camera,
and on top of that a tiny cameraman w ith his own camera on a
tripod. Then there are shots of a mo\'ie theater— first empt>, then
filling with spectators—and a projection booth. All these scenes
emphasize the continuity of the act of looking, with metaphors
such as one that links window blinds, a camera lens, and a human
e\e.
The cameraman's work
is related to circularitv. Shots of the
hand-cranked camera are intercut with moving wheels of cars and
bicycles. (Denis Kaufman's pseudonym, Vertov, was derived from
the verb to spin or rotate; the first name, Dziga, mimicked the
sound of a camera crank turning.) A regularly repeated segment
of the film shows the man with the movie camera mounted in the
back of an open car photographing people in a moving car beside
him (perhaps they should have called the film "Two Men with
Movie Cameras," to account for the cameraman in an unseen third
moving car who
is filming the filming).
Soon the work of Elizaveta Svilova as editor is brought into the
picture. Here the materialit>' of the image
is stressed— its existence

(By the Law,
1926), based on a
story by American writer jack
London
on rolls of celluloid that are stored in long rows, studied, cut, hung
from clips. The editor's work
is visually compared to manicuring,
sewing, and spinning. All these subjects are presented
in a dizzy-
ing array of visual techniques— an incomplete
list includes
split-screen (separate images occupying different parts of the
frame) shots, speeded-up action, freeze frames (a moving image
stopped on the screen as
if a
still), images at a slant, stop-motion
trick photography (as when the camera and tripod become ani-
mated and move by themselves), and floods of images flowing at
the spectator, at times with no apparent continuity.
The third term of the image process after photographing and
editing
is viewing, and the audience experience
is continually
reintroduced—the spectators in the theater, the screen, and some-
times on the screen a shot of the audience
itself. And finally there
is the actual world represented amid the world of image-making
and image-consuming.
It shows Soviet people at work and play,
marrying and divorcing, dying and being born (the film contains
one of the earliest shots of a birth
in cinema history). Without
explanatory intertitles, the spectator unable to pick up clues from
Russian-language documents or signs in the frame
is often a bit
lost as to what
is happening.
Still, for all
its avant-garde tech-
niques and theoretical ambitions. The Man with the Movie
Camera
is one of the few silent films that strongly conveys a
sense of everyday
life in Soviet Russia.
OTHER SOVIET FILMMAKERS
By the mid-1920s Soviet cinema was becoming firmly established.
Releases rose from thirteen
in 1923 to over one hundred in 1928,
the first year when domestic films outpaced foreign works in box
office revenues from Soviet theaters. There was a vastly proliferat-
ing body of cinema organizations whose acronyms and initials are
confusing enough, without the frequent name changes that
occurred. Most of the films forming the canon of Soviet silent cin-
ema were produced by the Coskino and Mezhrabpom-Russ stu-
dios
in Moscow; by Sovkino, a national film body formed
in 1924,
with studios in Leningrad and Moscow; and the Ukrainian studio
known as VUFKU,
in Kharkov. The Film School was the training
ground for new film personnel. Periodicals and conferences con-
stantly debated questions of style, theme, and the cinema's social
and ideological role.
The Reaction to Eisenstein
For filmmakers, however, a generally healthy competition in revo-
lutionary zeal and cinematic innovation was almost immediately
skewed by Eisenstein's achievement in The Battleship Potemkin.
Eisenstein had virtually retired the trophy before the race had
begun. Directors were faced with the equally unpromising choices
of trying to emulate him or to outdo him. Kuleshov had fallen into
this dilemma following Eisenstein's The Strike by making an elab-
orate science fiction thriller, Luch smerti (The Death Ray, 1925),
that was heavily criticized and almost caused the Goskino studio
to drop the Kuleshov group.
He sought to recover with a very different, un-Eisensteinian
kind of work, Po zakonu (By the Law, 1926), an intense realist
drama about gold prospectors in the Yukon, based on a story by
the American socialist writer Jack London. With most of the
action taking place in a small cabin, this was a Soviet equivalent
to the German Kammerspiel genre, though
in Kuleshov's style
more emphasis was placed on expressive body movement by
performers. Some critics saw By the Law as the beginning of an
"actors' cinema" as a possible alternative to Eisenstein, who was
less interested in performance than
in casting to type.
Vsevelod Pudovkin
Another potential advocate of "actors' cinema" was Vsevelod
Pudovkin, who had been a performer in the Kuleshov group, a
coworker in the Kuleshov effect experiments, and author of early
163

Vera Baranovskaia portrays
the mother and Nikolai Batalov
her son in Vsevelod Pudovkin's
Mat' (The Mother,
1926).
{The End of St. Petersburg, 1927), a few months ahead of
October. Again Pudovkin built an individualized story line—
a
peasant family forced by poverty to move to the city, whence
members participate in events leading from the World War to the
storming of the Winter Palace. Though much of the film's treat-
ment of the prerevolutionary era seems stylistically hyperbolic,
with exaggerated villains and scenes of stock market speculation
derived from Lang's Dr. Mabuse, the moment of revolutionary
tri-
umph
is surprisingly muted, as family members find each other
among exhausted Soviet soldiers.
Pudovkin's third historical fiction, Potomok Chingis-khana
(lit-
erally "The Heir of Genghis Khan," but titled
in English Storm
over Asia, 1928), was set in the postrevolutionary era, during the
Civil War period of 1918-20 when British forces invaded Soviet
territory from the east. The film retains
its strongest interest in seg-
ments filmed on location
in Mongolia, with documentary scenes
of indigenous religious rituals and ceremonies that give the work
power as an ethnographic record that
its political fiction has long
ago lost. Another film that shifted attention to the east was
pamphlets on film technique that gave considerable attention to
acting. Pudovkin's debut fiction feature as director. Mat' {The
Mother, 1926), was a hybrid of several styles: avant-garde tech-
niques a
la Eisenstein, such as superimpositions; an emphasis on
performance, through frequent use of expressive close-ups; and a
constant recourse to natural symbolism, such as shots of ice
breaking up and water flowing as metaphors for human events.
Based on a novel by the popular Soviet writer Maxim Gorki, The
Mofher dealt with prerevolutionary struggles similar to those of
The Strike. But
it strongly individualized the narrative through a
story of a woman who innocently betrays her son to authorities,
then redeems herself by raising high the flag of rebellion just as
she meets her own death.
Pudovkin outpaced Eisenstein by releasing his film on the tenth
anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, Konets Sankt-Peterburga

Express, 1929), directed by llya Trauberg (1905-1948), which

a society and
its revolutionary potential.
Ahram Room
The triumph of a performance-oriented cinema was Tret'ya
Meshchanskaya {Bed and Sofa, 1927), directed by Abram Room
(1894-1976). Except for a few candid moments, this love-triangle
story might have been
little noticed had
it been made in a
Western country, where romantic melodramas were produced by
the dozens. But in the Soviet Union, where films with contempo-
164

rary everyday settings were scarce, and both heroes and villains
in prestige pictures tended to be stick figures, the film came as a
revelation.
The premise behind this three-character drama
is Moscow's
housing problem. A worker new to the city cannot find a place to
live, but an old army buddy, already shown to be an insensitive
husband, offers him the sofa to sleep on. The husband goes away
on a job assignment, the unhappy wife and the lodger become
friends and soon lovers. When the husband returns and learns of
the new relationship, he moves out, but he cannot find a place
either, and returns—to the sofa. The woman now finds both men
insensitive, and all three sleep alone. She learns she
is pregnant.
She goes to an abortion clinic but abruptly decides to leave the
men and have the baby on her own.
All three performers are worth noting: Nikolai Batalov, who
played the son
in The Mother, as the husband; Vladimir Fogel,
who looked like James Dean and also tragically died young, as
the friend; and Ludmilla Semyonova as the wife. After the very
discreetly handled tryst between the friend and the wife.

/? usStan
If cinema,
in the phrase attributed to
Lenin, was the Soviet Union's "most
important art," a variety of movements
and "isms" also thrived in other art forms,
including painting and sculpture, poetry,
and theater. Some of these movements
were well established before the
Bolshevik revolution, but many artists
became revolutionary enthusiasts and
linked their practice to revolutionary
ideas, as did filmmakers such as
Eisenstein and Vertov. There are conflict-
ing viewpoints on whether the
terminology of movements in other arts
can be applied to cinema, although some
critics and historians confidently do so.
Futurism in prerevolutionary Russia
derived from Italian Futurism, a move-
ment launched in 1909 by Italian poet
Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Disdaining
what they saw as the sentimentality and
nostalgia of nineteenth-century art, futur-
ovement:>
ist poets and visual artists wanted to cre-
ate works that represented the dynamism
of their contemporary world, dominated
by technology, movement, and speed.
The leading Russian futurist was poet
Vladimir Mayakovski (1893-1930), who
broke with traditional rhythm and deco-
rous language to write poetry in street
vernacular. Mayakovski became an avid
supporter of the revolution and was a
popular poet in the 1920s, though the
term "futurism" fell out of favor after 1922
when Italian futurists supported the
Fascist seizure of power in Italy. As also
happened to filmmakers, Mayakovski's
work came under official criticism
in the
late 1920s for
its avant-garde "formalism."
He committed suicide in 1930.
Constructivism, a term that replaced
futurism in the 1920s, was in a way futur-
ism with a Soviet face. This concept
viewed the artist as an "engineer": the
artist united revolutionary ideology with
his or her materials in order simultane-
ously to construct new content and new
form. Even more than in futurism, the
emphasis was on technology and indus-
trial forms. Though constructivism was
especially important in painting, sculp-
ture, and architecture,
it also played a
significant role in Soviet theater through
the work of director Vsevolod Meyerhold
(1874-19401. Even before the revolution
Meyerhold was developing a "biome-
chanical" theory of acting drawn from
industrial motion analysis, emphasizing
body control rather than emotion as the
basis of performance (Eisenstein adapted
this idea for cinema). Meyerhold became
head of theater activities in the Soviet
Union, but like so many other Soviet
artists he was eventually attacked and
purged by the regime. He was arrested
in 1939 and executed in 1940.
Semyonova
is sitting on the bed beside her sleeping lover. She
rests her cheek on the gauze-covered metal bar of the bed frame,
and then impulsively bites at the bar.
It
is one of those unforget-
table moments of performance that remind us of cinema's
capacity to reveal the complexities of human emotions.
Alexander Dovzhenko
Dominated by directors whose careers had begun on agit-trains,
at the Film School, or in Moscow theater work, the Soviet film
world was startled
in 1928 by the emergence of the first major
regional figure, Alexander Dovzhenko (1894-1956). Production
had developed in Ukraine and
in other non-Russian Soviet
republics such as Georgia, yet these films received
little attention
in the main centers of the Soviet industry. Dovzhenko, who came
from a peasant background and had fought with the Bolsheviks
against Ukrainian nationalists in the postrevolutionary civil war,
had made no impact with his first two films, shot at the VUFKU
studio in Odessa. But his third feature, Zvenigora (1928),
propelled him by
its original force into the top rank of Soviet
filmmakers (Zvenigora
is the name of a mountain in Ukraine,
and the film has always gone by
its original title).
In a setting where a range of nonrealist, avant-garde techniques
had by repetition almost become formulas, Zvenigora neverthe-
less managed to display an avant-garde style different from
anything to which Soviet filmmakers and their sophisticated audi-
ences had become accustomed.
Its opening shot of horses
galloping in slow motion signals the spectator to expect disorien-
tation. The film quickly takes on the character of a fable, linking
past and present in a timeless whole and shifting temporality in
the manner of the magic realist style practiced in late-twentieth-
century Latin American and Eastern European literature (magic
realism was in fact a term coined in the European art debates of
the 1920s). And like the later magic realist literary works, the film
directs
its fabulist techniques toward political allegory: in
/66

Zvenigora, the need to discover the strengths of Ukraine's past
and unite them with
its Bolshevik present.
Of cinema's great works, Zvenigora
is among the most
neglected. Like The Man with the Movie Camera,
its cultural ref-
erences are often difficult to decipher. But there
is also much to
reward the spectator, who may be as surprised on
first viewing as
Moscow audiences were in 1928.
Dovzhenko's equivalent to October and The End ot St.
Petersburg as a commissioned film to commemorate the recent
past was Arsenal (The Arsenal, 1929).
Its subject was a 1918 event
in the Ukrainian civil war—the successful defense of the Arsenal
munitions plant in Kiev during a six-day attack. What makes The

Zemlya (The Earth,

Arsenal remarkable as a film intended to be politically correct and
ideologically didactic are two, perhaps connected, aspects. One
is
a style that frequently veers toward the absurd (as when a portrait
hanging on a wall begins to move
its head), giving the film at
times a Surrealist atmosphere. The other
is a completely unroman-
ticized, absolutely grim treatment of violence and death, even
in
revolutionary struggle.
Zemlya (The Earth, 1930)
is Dovzhenko's best-known but also
most controversial film, and the one that earned him a reputation
as a poet of the cinema. Like Eisenstein's The Old and the New,
it
deals with the contentious issue of farm collectivization, and com-
bines a strong emphasis on the cycles of death and renewal
in
life
and nature with touches of Surrealist humor.
Its centerpiece
is a lyric-tragic sequence where Vasyl, the hero
of collective farming,
is walking slowly through the village at
night. Then ho begins to dance, and a scries of shots shows him
dancing alone along the village paths, radiating joy, energy, and
power. Suddenly he crumples to the ground. There
is a cut to a
horse lifting
its head, signaling in this silent film a loud noise like a
gunshot—then back to the shot of the fallen Vasyl, with a person
scuttling off in the background. Vasyl's martyrdom unites the
peasants on the side of collectivization and against the rich farm-
ers who have murdered him.
ART AND IDEOLOGY
The Earth was one of the works that brought to a head a growing
struggle within the Soviet film community. While some criticized
the film for alleged flaws in ideological analysis or political strat-
egy, the overriding issue for filmmakers was one of aesthetics. The
Earth was lumped together with other works that one polemic
called "Formalist obscurantism and mystical Symbolist
nonsense."** (Formalism was a term almost always applied pejora-
tively in Soviet film debates; at the same time
it could be said
accurately to describe works whose emphasis was on form rather
than on story, or acting.) Nevertheless, nearly every filmmaker dis-
168

cussed in this chapter, despite considerable variations in style and
significant emphasis by some on narrative and performance,
came under attack.
At stake was the issue raised when the first Soviet filmmakers
dedicated themselves to creating a revolutionary art: Were films to
be revolutionary as art or revolutionary because of their ideology?
A few films seem to have passed both tests: principally The
Battleship Potemkin. The Mother, and The End of St. Petersburg.
But a great number of other works, perhaps especially among
those admired by Western filmmakers and critics for their avant-
garde style, were condemned as petty bourgeois rather than
proletarian in their orientation.
Socialist Realism
The proletarian standard began increasingly to be raised in the late
1920s as the rationale for cinema in the Soviet state.
In one sense
this represented new policies of the Stalin era (though any com-
parison with Lenin's viewpoint
is purely inferential, since Lenin
died before there was a Soviet cinema for him to criticize); in
another sense
it came from new cadres of film bureaucrats who
were responsible for meeting production goals and pleasing the
political leadership. What mattered was not film art but a cine-
matic practice that could please (and also politically indoctrinate)
a mass audience of workers and peasants. Like mass audiences
everywhere, this one wanted genre entertainment (a desire that in
the early postrevolutionary years had been satisfied by importing
Western films). Bv raising the proletarian standard, the film indus-
try emphasized the production of genre entertainments that were
ideologically correct from a Soviet viewpoint. In the 1930s this
practice was codified under the term socialist realism.
The Problem ofSound
Bureaucrats, both in the film industry and outside
it, began to plav
a more active role in the filmmaking process. Projects had to be
approved for political correctness before resources could be com-
mitted; completed films were subjected to further ideological
tests, and held back from release
if they failed. These difficulties
were exacerbated by the problem of sound. The Soviet cinema
was not as advanced in sound technolog\ as were, particularly,
the United States and Germany (see Chapter 81.
It was difficult,
however, to forge ahead with silent film production while Western
countries converted fully to sound. Production
fell off in 1929,
and the annual number of releases continued to decline for sev-
eral years after that.
Sound technology was also viewed bv many critics as a funda-
mental challenge to the montage principle that lay at the heart of
Soviet cinema's achievements. Early talking pictures, especially
because of technological restraints on movement of both the cam-
era and the actors, seemed to signal a return to the simplest form
of filmed theater. In this context, several years before the first
Soviet sound films appeared, directors Eisenstein and Pudovkin,
along with scriptwriter Alexandrov, jointK released a "Statement
on Sound."
Its purpose was to la\ out several theoretical argu-
ments supporting the continuing primacy of montage in a sound
cinema.
They took the view that sound was not a threat to montage but
an avenue of escape from "blind alleys" into which they thought
montage filmmaking had been headed. These were,
first, a grow-
ing tendency by filmmakers to turn intertitles into elaborate trick
shots (for example, bv making words grow or shrink in size
through the duration 01 an
intertitle, as
ii modulating volume);
and, second, what they called "explanatory sequences" that
slowed down montage rhythm. They advocated the use of contra-
puntal sound.
" The first experiments in sound must aim ai a sharp discord
with the visual images," they wrote (italics in all cases theirs).
They called this a "hammer and tongs" approach to create "a new
orchestral counterpoint of visual and sound images."'
This statement had
little effect except to please a handful of
Western critics who regarded the talking picture as the downfall
of cinematic art. Neither Eisenstein nor Pudovkin was involved in
early Soviet sound films, in 1929 both directors were sent abroad
to exploit the prestige of Soviet silent films in Europe and the
United States. Pudovkin went to Germany, where he performed
the lead role in a film coproduced by Soviet and German compa-
nies, Zhivoi trup {A Living Corpse, 1929, directed by Fyodor
Otsep); later he lectured in Britain and Holland before returning to
the Soviet Union. Eisenstein (along with Tisse and Alexandrov)
stopped in a number of western European countries en route to
Hollywood, where an original plan to study American movies
turned into an effort to make an American movie. His major pro-
ject was an adaptation for Paramount of Theodore Dreiser's novel
An American Tragedy, when producer David O. Selznick read the
script (a collaboration of Eisenstein, Alexandrov, and British writer
Ivor Montagu), he called
it "the most moving script
I have ever
read," but added, "as entertainment,
I don't think
it has one
chance in a hundred."*" Unable to get this or other projects
approved by the studios, Eisenstein went on to Mexico to shoot a
film, "Que Viva Mexico!," sponsored by American socialist writer
Upton Sinclair. This ended
in even greater disappointment when
Sinclair, concerned over costs, cut off further financing and con-
fiscated all the footage on the unfinished film. Eisenstein returned
to the Soviet Union
in 1932, but did not begin shooting another
film until 1936."
EXTHUSIASM. One of the first Soviet filmmakers given a
chance to make a sound film was Vertov. His Simfoniya Donbassa
("The Donbass Symphony," but titled in English-language versions
Enthusiasm, 1930), a documentary about industrial production in
the Don River basin, was, characteristically, a difficult avant-garde
work. There are moments of sound/image counterpoint as advo-
cated in the "Statement on Sound," as when jazz plays on the
soundtrack during religious scenes, but there are many other
sound experiments: synchronous sound (sound recorded simulta-
neously with the imagei shot on location, which was still
relatively uncommon
in Western cinemas, where early sound
films were studio-bound; separate sounds edited to clash lor har-
monize) by occurring at the same time on the soundtrack;
"abstract" sound with no clear source or referent; sound juxta-
posed with a blank screen.
Enthusiasm
is an avant-garde triumph equal to any similar non-
fiction work of the century. But
it did not fare well by the
proletarian standard. Though
it shows many scenes of industrial
and also agricultural labor,
it seems to create less a feeling of joy
in work than of pathos, b\ showing how strenuous and dangerous
such labor often
is. The film came under severe political criticism.
It marked the end point of an effort to create an avant-garde cin-
ema under revolutionary auspices, the lessons of which continue
to be pondered within film cultures of many different political
systems.

Among many films and filmmakers influ-
enced by Soviet silent cinema, one of the
most interesting examples
is a film that
was made contemporaneously by a
Japanese filmmaker who had actually not
yet seen any Soviet films (when they
arrived
in Japan, films such as The
Battleship Potemkin were confiscated by
authorities because of their allegedly sub-
versive political content). The film
is
Kurutta ippeiji [Page of Madness, 1926),
directed by Teinosuke Kinugasa
(1896-1982), a work thought lost for
more than half a century until
its redis-
covery in the 1970s. Kinugasa had read
accounts of Soviet montage theories,
translated from German magazines, and
these impelled him to make what
is
regarded as Japan's first avant-garde film.
The work challenged almost every aspect
of Japanese film conventions:
it cast
women in the parts previously played by
oyama (female impersonators) and
attempted to confound the benshi narra-
tors by adopting a rapid, impressionistic
montage style.
In 1928 Kinugasa went to
Moscow, where he met with Eisenstein,
Pudovkin, and Alexandrov at the time of
their "Statement on Sound."

EIGHT
HE TRANSITION
The shift from silent to sound film at the end of the
1920s marks, so far, the most important transformation
in motion picture history. Despite all the highly visible
technological developments in theatrical and home
delivery of the moving image that have occurred over the decades
since then, no single innovation has come close to being regarded
as a similar kind of v^/atershed.
In nearly every language, however
the words are phrased, the most basic division
in cinema history
lies between films that are mute and films that speak.
Yet this most fundamental standard of historical periodization
conceals a host of paradoxes. Nearly every movie theater, no mat-
ter how modest, had a piano or organ to provide musical
accompaniment to "silent" pictures, in many instances, spectators
in the era before recorded sound experienced elaborate aural pre-
sentations alongside movies' visual images, from the Japanese
benshi crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to original musical
compositions performed by symphony-sized orchestras in Europe
and the United States. For the premiere performance outside the
Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin,
in Berlin, Eisenstein
worked with Austrian composer Edmund Meisel (1874-1930) on
a musical score matching sound to image; the Berlin screenings
with
live music helped to bring the film
its wide international
fame.
Beyond that, the triumph of recorded sound has overshadowed
the rich diversity of technological and aesthetic experiments with
the visual imago that were going forward simultaneously in the
1920s. New color processes, larger or differently shaped screen
sizes, multiple-screen projections, even television, were among
the developments invented or tried out during the period, some-
times with startling success. The high costs of converting to sound
and the early limitations of sound technology were among the fac-
tors that suppressed innovations or retarded advancement in these
other areas. The introduction of new screen formats was put off
for a quarter century, and color, though utilized over the next two
decades for special productions, also did not become a norm until
the 1950s.
Though
it may be difficult to imagine from a later perspective,
a strain of critical opinion in the 1920s predicted that sound film
would be a technical novelty that would soon fade from sight, just
as had many previous attempts, dating back well before World
War
I, to link images with recorded sound. These critics were
making a common assumption—that the technological inade-
quacies of earlier efforts (poor synchronization, weak sound
amplification, fragile sound recordings) would invariably occur
again. To be sure, their evaluation of the technical flaws in 1920s
sound experiments was not so far off the mark; yet they neglected
to take into account important new forces in the motion picture
field that, in a sense, would not take no for an answer.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND
FILM SOUND
These forces were the rapidly expanding electronics and tele-
communications companies that were developing and linking
telephone and wireless technologies in the 1920s.
In the United
States, they included such firms as American Telephone and
Telegraph (with
its subsidiaries Western Electric and Bell
172

Laboratories), General Electric, Radio Corporation of America
iRCAi, Westinghouse. and others. They were interested in all
forms of sound technology and all potential avenues for commer-
cial exploitation. Their competitions and collaborations were
creating the broadcasting industry in the United States, beginning
with the introduction of commercial radio programming in the
early 1920s. With financial assets considerably greater than those
in the motion picture industr\', and perhaps a wider vision of the
relationships among entertainment and communications media,
they revitalized research into recording sound for motion pictures.
Two basic technologies were pursued: sound-on-disc (similar to a
phonograph record; and sound-on-film
the optica! recording of
sound as an element on the celluloid film strip).
Sound-on-disc
In the 1920s sound-on-disc (which had
its antecedents in Edison's
nineteenth-century idea of uniting phonograph with motion pic-
ture camera; was the first to attain practical status for commercial
development. Having solved the problem of adequate amplifica-
tion. Western Electric was readv in 1926 \\ ith a system of disc
recorder and camera powered b> the same motor. The company
teamed with a Hollywood studio. Wanner Bros., to form the
Vitaphone Corporation. At the exhibition end, the Vitaphone sys-
particulaHy as a spin-off of research on radio and telephone
sound transmission for military purposes during World War
I. In
the United States the inventors Lee de Forest (1874-1961
) and
Theodore Case (1888-1944; presented their Phonofilm system in
1923. Case and de Forest ended their work together in 1925, and
the following year Case, with his assistant Earl
I. Sponable
'1895-1977), devised a new sound reproducing head that could
be added to existing (xojectors. A few weeks before Western
Electric and Warner Bros, demonstrated the sound-on-disc
Vitaphone, Fox Film Corporation purchased the rights to Case's
sound-on-film system and called
it Movietone.
Sound in Europe
In the same period as these United States developments, inventors
in Denmark and Germany were making similar progress. The
Danish system, developed by
P. O. Pederson and Vlademar
Poulsen in 1923. at first utilized separate picture and sound film
reels. The Pederson-Poulsen system was utilized in Britain; in
Germany, where
it was known as Tonfilm; and in France, where
the first French sound film was made in 1928 with the Danish
apparatus. A different system that initially put the soundtrack out-
side the perforations on the film roll was de\'elop)ed in Germany
by three inventors, Josef Engl, Joseph Massolle, and Hans Vogt.
TO SOUND
tem utilized a projector and tumtable run bv the same motor, as
well as loudspeakers for sound amplification. The system was
demonstrated in August 1926 with a screening of short musical
films, and Wamer Bros, quicklv expanded into sound feature film
production. Difficulties in the Vitaphone system's technology,
however, soon became amply exposed— discs broke, and projec-
tionists often had trouble correctly s\ nchronizing disc and picture.
By 1930 Wamer Bros, shifted over to sound-on-film.
Sound-on-film
Sound-on-film uas developed using different formats in several
countries. All of these involved the optical recording of sound
turning sound waves into photographic images. Exp>eriments with
this process had been going on since the late nineteenth century.
In simple terms, inventors devised a series of steps by which
sounds were converted into a variable electric current that acti-
vated a modulated light beam projected onto negative film. This
created the wavy streaks of white lines we see when we look at
what
is called a variable-density soundtrack. In the movie projec-
tor, the process
is resersed: light projected onto the soundtrack
activates a variable electrical current that is converted back into
sounds.
Amplification
A working model based on these principles had been demon-
strated as early as 1906. What was principally missing was a
means to amplify the sound, which was not fully developed, as
with sound-on-disc, until the mid-1 920s. In the sears between, a
great many technical improvements were made in the process.
Their process, called Tri-Ergon, was put on the market bv the
Tonbild-Syndikat, known as Tobis, which soon merged with
another firm to become Tobis-Klangfilm. This became the leading
European sound company.
Patent Struggles
Patent disputes among these three systems were likely to be con-
siderably more complicated than e\'en the struggles over early
motion picture technology. Both the Danish and German inven-
tors had secured ke\ patents in the United States that threatened,
even against the might of the American industrial giants, to
involve years of litigation and slow down the pace of sound film
development, as Edison's court battles had hobbled the medium
in the pioneer da\s of cinema. A 1930 Paris conference of patent
holders attempted to reconcile patent claims and allocate rights,
roN'alties, and territories, akin to the Motion Picture Patents Trust
agreements of 1908. Though these arrangements frequentK broke
down over the next few years, industrial fights did not appear to
hinder the advancement of sound in the major film-producing
countries.
Hollywood and Sound
Despite the efforts of Warner Bros, and Fox, the largest
HolK'wood studios. Paramount and Metro-Goldw\'n-Mayer, did
not appear at first nearly so interested in converting to sound.
However, the success of Wamer's features produced with the
Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, and Fox's determination to
switch
its feature film output entirely to sound, persuaded other
companies to join the movement. Rapid consolidation occurred
173

in the motion picture industry as stronger studios sought to
enlarge their base of theaters, distribution exchanges, and produc-
tion facilities in the wake of significant investments in wiring
theaters for sound. Fox for a time took over Loew's Inc., the par-
ent company of M-G-M, but was forced to give
it up because of
government pressure against motion picture monopolies and
financial losses after the 1929 stock market crash. A merger was
discussed, but never accomplished, between Paramount and
Warner Bros. When the dust settled, these four firms
Paramount, M-G-M, Fox, and Warner Bros.—were clearly
established as Hollywood's leading companies, the "majors."
RKO. The conversion to sound created a fifth "major"
Hollywood studio. RCA established a movie company as a vehi-
cle for marketing to theaters
its own sound system, Photophone,
in competition with Vitaphone and Movietone. RCA joined with
Film Booking Office, a small studio, for its production facilities,
and the Keith-Albee-Orpheum vaudeville circuit, in order to
acquire
its theaters and
its control over the American Pathe stu-
dio. The resulting amalgam was called Radio-Keith-Orpheum, or
RKO.
Conversion to Sound
in 1929 the United States motion picture industry released more
than three hundred sound films— a rough figure, since a number
were silent films with music tracks, or films prepared in dual ver-
sions, to take account of the many theaters not yet wired for
sound. At the production
level,
in the United States the conver-
sion was virtually complete by 1930. In Europe
it took a
little
longer, mainly because there were more small producers for
whom the costs of sound were prohibitive, and
in other parts of
the world problems with rights or access to equipment delayed
the shift to sound production for a few more years (though the-
aters in major cities may have been wired in order to play foreign
sound pictures). By 1930, meanwhile, virtually everyone making
sound films had committed to sound-on-film rather than sound-
on-disc, utilizing one or another of the American or European
systems. The triumph of sound cinema was swift, complete, and
enormously popular.
COLOR AND WIDESCREEN
We might pause for a moment and attempt one of those exercises
historians occasionally resort to, the "counterfactual" question:
what
if? What
if the sound amplification problem had not been
solved and sound reproduction had come out so crude and tinny
that nobody liked
it? What
if attention and capital had gravitated
toward other potential innovations? What creative directions
might the silent film have evolved in
if
it had not, like a prehistoric
beast, been marked for extinction?
The world's film archives hold a few tantalizing possible
answers. But most of us have a problem in getting to see the evi-
dence. While important efforts are being made to preserve and
restore classic silent films,
it remains true that major silent film
experiments with color or large-screen formats (known by the
general term widescreen) are only rarely available for general
public viewing in their original form. When they exist in the
16mm or video formats used for classroom or home screening,
they are almost always presented
in black-and-white versions,
with standard screen dimensions.
8. 1.
The documentary Chang
(1927) was one of several films
released in Magnascope, a
widescreen process in which a
special lens dramatically enlarged
the screen image for spectacular
scenes like this elephant stam-
pede through a village in Siam
(now Thailand). Filmmakers
Marian C. Cooper (1894-1973)
and Ernest B. Schoedsack
( 1893-19791 built the structures
and staged this scene, preferring
not to destroy an actual village.

8.2,8.3. One ot several two-
color processes used in film
during the 1920s was Eastman
Kodak s Kodachrome. The film
was shot with two frames side-by-
side, one exposed through a
green filter, the other through
red. A positive print was made of
each, then these prints were again
printed on opposite sides of
double-coated film, one side red,
the other green. These two shots
are examples of the final image.
Magnascope
Some experiences were created not on film but through projec-
tion and can only be re-created using the proper equipment and
setting. An example
is Magnascope, a widescreen process intro-
duced in the 1920s using a special enlarging lens. To prepare a
Magnascope presentation, an extra-large screen was installed to
encompass the entire area within a theater's proscenium arch.
Then the wider areas of this expanse were curtained oft so that
onlv the standard screen was exposed. Two prints of a film were
mounted on separate projectors, one equipped with a
Magnascope lens and stronger illumination to maintain brightness
over a larger area. In moments of spectacular action, such as an
elephant stampede in Chang or the World War
I aerial battles in
Wirigs (both 1927), the Magnascope projector would enlarge the
image to
fill the vast screen space dramatically exposed to view.
Magnascope was rarely seen outside a few big-city picture
palaces,
it was utilized for perhaps half a dozen films in the mid-
1920s and several more times after World War
II.

process Multicolor by financier

"No one mourned the passing of the
silent cartoon," animation historian
Leonard Maltin has written. Following the
pioneer work in animated cartoons before
World War
I by Emile Cohl
in France,
Winsor McCay in the United States, and
others, cartoons became somewhat rou-
tine commercial products, put on theater
screens as part of short film packages that
preceded feature films.
In a broader sense, animation (the film-
ing of a series of still images so as, when
projected, to create the illusion of move-
ment) played a significant role in the
development of avant-garde film.
In
Germany, artists Hans Richter
(1888-1976) and Viking Eggeiing
(1880-1925) gained access to the anima-
tion tables at Ufa studio and made short
films from drawings and graphic designs,
including Richter's Rhythmus 21
(1921-24) and Eggeling's Diagonale
SInfonie (Diagonal Symphony, 1925).
In
the French surrealist movement, artists
made films incorporating animated
designs and objects, including Le Ballet
mecanique (1924), by painter Fernand
Leger (1881-1955); Anemic Cinema
(1926), by Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968);
and Emak Bakia (1927), by American
painter and photographer Man Ray
(1890-1976).
In the United States, where there was
no comparable activity in avant-garde
animation, critical and popular interest in
animation was revived by a cartoon char-
acter named Felix the Cat, created
in
1919 by Otto Messmer and produced by
Pat Sullivan (1887-1933). Felix was the
first animated cartoon character to be
manufactured as a toy for children. Other
significant producers of animated car-
toons in the 1920s included the brothers
Max Fleischer (1883-1972) and Dave
Fleischer (1894-1979), whose main char-
acter in silent animations was Ko-Ko the

Minnie Mouse cranks its tail to
produce the sound, while
Mickey observes.
Clown, and Walt Disney (1901-1966),
whose silent creations included the Alice
in Cartoonland series [a combination of
animation and live action) and Oswald
the Rabbit.
A crisis erupted tor Disney in 1928
when a producer took the popular
Oswald away from him. Disney and his
coworker Ub Iwerks (1901-1971
) created
a new character, Mickey Mouse, and pro-
duced two cartoons on their own. But no
distributor was willing to handle them.
Disney then took a gamble: he would try
to break the logjam by making another
Mickey Mouse cartoon, Steamboat Willie
(1928), as the first animated cartoon with
synchronized sound.
Several cartoons made as siients had
already been released with added sound
tracks, but Disney developed Steamboat
lV/7/;ewith sound completely integrated
into the narrative and animated move-
ment. A bouncing ball was inked in on
the film strip to guide the orchestra con-
ductor's tempo. With neither the Fox nor
Warner Bros, sound systems available to
him, he found another system.
Cinephone, owned by an independent
producer, to record the film, and pre-
miered
it in New York without a
distributor on November 18, 1928.
Thereafter, as Maltin wrote, no one
mourned the passing of the silent
cartoon.
8.6.
Fox Film Company's Gran-
deur system used 70mm film
(rather than the standard 35mml
to enlarge the screen image.
Three Grandeur films were made,
including The Big Trail (1930),
directed by Raoul Walsh, with
John Wayne and Marguerite
Churchill.
Color Experiments
More available to the typical moviegoer in the 1920s were experi-
ments with color— which had received, over the years, nearly as
much attention from inventors as sound. Color technology did not
gain, as did sound, from stepped-up research impelled by military
needs during World War
I. On the other hand, coloring films was
a simpler and less expensive process than adding sound. As early
as 1905 the French Pathe company had begun to replace hand-
tinting of individual film frames with tinting machines through
which entire segments or scenes could be passed, to give them a
"mood" coloring of a single shade— red for fires, blue for night,
yellow for daytime exteriors. Pathe developed a stencil system,
called Pathecolor, that colored films frame-by-frame with several
colors, until a multihued image was achieved. All these processes
added an artistic conception of appropriate colors to an image
photographed
in black-and-white.
Recorded Color
There were also efforts to record on film the original colors of the
photographed subject. As with the Kinemacolor process (see
Chapter 2), these began by using color filters (screens made of
glass or dried gelatin, placed over the lens) both
in recording and
projecting the image. A scene would be photographed using two
lenses, one with a red filter, the other green. A projector with two
lenses would then project the black-and-white print through simi-
lar-colored filters. The blending of colors could produce on the
screen, under optimal circumstances, an acceptably realistic-
seeming color image. The problem, as usual, was that
circumstances were frequently less than optimal.
If the separate
177

images were not pert'ectlv matched, or projector speeds not per-
fectly timed, either the colors or the images would be "out of
register" (examples of this uneven color matching can sometimes
be seen on the Sunday newspaper comics pages).
Technicolor
Inventors worked to overcome these defects by achieving the same
two-color effects with a single lens. Around World War
I the
Technicolor process photographed two frames through one lens,
but adequate projection proved too difficult. In the early 1920s the
two separate color negatives were printed on specially prepared
film strips that were dyed and pasted together to form a single pos-
itive print containing all the colors the spectator would see,
without the necessity of additional filters or complex projection
mechanisms. Technicolor, devised principally by Herbert Kalmus
(1882-1963), was the first widely successful color film process.
Still, the cemented images could be out of line, and the extra
thickness of the print led to problems of scratching or buckling.
These drawbacks were overcome in 1928 with development of a
dye transfer system that could print the separate color negatives
onto a single positive film with precise registration.
The first feature-length all-Technicolor product appeared in
1922, and
its biggest success was a Douglas Fairbanks film. The
Black Pirate 0926). More commonly, the Hollywood studios
utilized Technicolor for special sequences within black-and-
white films. Erich von Stroheim's The Wedding March (1928), the
M-C-M musical The Broadway Melody {]929), and Paramount's
omnibus Paramount on Parade (1930) are among several dozen
films originally released with Technicolor sequences that generally
appear solely in black-and-white in current circulating versions.
Two-color Technicolor peaked
in 1930, with nearly thirty all- or
part-color productions.
Its utilization was scaled back over the
next several years while the company developed a three-color
process,
first tested
in a Walt Disney cartoon, Flowers and Trees
(1932). Three-color Technicolor began to appear in Hollywood
features in the mid-1 930s and remained the dominant color system
for several decades even though
it was used for only a small
minority of films.
Aiulticolor
Technicolor's only competition
in Hollywood came from the
Multicolor process, which used a
"bipack" system (two negative
films placed together in the camera emulsion to emulsion, which,
when exposed by a single camera lens, would record different
portions of the color spectrum; these were then printed on one
positive film). Multicolor had occasional use in color sequences of
films such as the 1929 Fox musical Sunny Side Up. The financier
Howard Hughes bought Multicolor in 1930 and used
it in
sequences of his first film,
hiell's Angels (1930), but the system
soon faded from use.
Larger Film Stock
If sound films had the backing of giant communication compa-
nies, and the big photographic firms were concerned with color
film, widescreen experiments sought support directly from the
motion picture studios, and they were only rarely interested.
Beyond the few Magnascope presentations, widescreen produc-
tions in the late 1920s could be counted on the fingers of both
hands, and after 1931 they went info hibernation for two decades.
One way to expand the screen image was by using film stock
larger than the standard 3.5mm gauge. Several efforts with 70mm
film were marketed under varied trademarks, including Grandeur,
the name the Fox company gave to three widescreen presenta-
tions. Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and Happv Days (both 1929)
and The Big Trail (1930). A variation was 65mm film, used on
such films as the Warner Bros. Kismet and a United Artists release,
The Bat Whispers (both 1930). M-G-M tried out a system
it called
Realife, which photographed film in 65mm and projected
it on
35mm stock with an enlarging lens. King Vidor's Billy the Kid
(1930) was one of only two Realife releases; the other was The
Great Meadow \^93^).
The Anamorp>hic Lens
Major investments in converting production and theaters to sound,
coupled with the beginnings of the Great Depression following the
1929 stock market crash, persuaded movie companies they could
not afford the additional costs involving new cameras, projectors,
and theater screens for widescreen presentations. The process that
was to revolutionize screen dimensions in the 1950s was already
available, but evoked
little interest. This was the anamorphic lens,
whose principles were described in 1927 by Henri Chretien
(1877-1956), a French scientist, and developed bv Chretien and
others soon after. Chretien constructed a lens he called the
Hypergonar, which, when fitted over a regular camera lens,
greatly expanded the lateral range of the image that could be
recorded on standard 35mm film (without affecting the vertical
range). When held in one's hands, or projected with standard
projection lenses, the recorded image looked compressed, or
"squeezed.
" But when an anamorphic lens was placed over the
regular projector lens, as had been done with the camera, the
image would appear in
its normal vertical proportions with a con-
siderably wider horizontal field than could be recorded by regular
lenses.
Aspect Ratios
The standard projected image at that time had \\ hat was known as
an aspect ratio of 1.33:1.
In other words, the screen image was
one-third w ider than
it was high. When a Hollywood studio
acquired the rights to Chretien's anamorphic lens in the 1950s and
named the process CinemaScope, the new aspect ratio reached
2.66:1, twice as wide as standard, or two and two-thirds wider
than high (the soundtrack slightly reduced the picture width, and
man\ theaters had to crop the sides further because their screens
were not wide enough
i.
Napol>eon
The greatest triumph of widescreen experimentation in the era
was conceived b\ French director Abel Gance, who had already
demonstrated visionary ambitions in La Roue. For Slapoleon
(1927), a biographical film on the French general and emperor,
Gance devised a plan utilizing three standard screens side-bv-side
(an aspect ratio of 3.99:1, or half again w ider than anamorphic
widescreen I. The completed film ran over five hours. Though
much of
it appeared on the single center screen, at crucial
sequences the curtains would draw back to rexeal the other two
screens. The screens were used in variable combinations—some-
times three separate images, sometimes a central image flanked by
two parts of another scene,
in climactic moments action (pho-
tographed b\ three separate cameras) sweeping across all three
screens in a single image.

Napoleon ^927;,

ranks as the most elaborate
widescreen project in film history.
It utilized three standard screens
side-by-side. Sometimes three
separate images appeared (top); at
other times a central image was
flanked by scenes that resemble
each other (bottom). At key
moments (not illustrated here) a
single image, photographed by
three separate cameras, con-
sumed all three screens. Lost for

until the American producer-director Francis Ford Coppola put his
resources behind efforts by film historian Kevin Brownlow and
other scholars to find as much as possible of Gance's original.

Napoleon with English-language intertitles premiered in 1979 at
New York's mammoth surviving picture palace. Radio City Music

thus partially re-created and returned to circulation.
MUSIC AND EFFECTS TRACK
With neither color nor widescreen accompanying the transition to
sound, what other "what
ifs" remained as alternatives to talking
pictures? Perhaps the most viable was the possibility of a compro-
mise between silent and sound films, eschewing speaking voices
but with a musical and effects soundtrack. Though
in practical
terms this was generally utilized only when silent films had been
completely shot and the music and effects track added as a stop-
gap,
if held the promise at least of preserving the visual aesthetics
of silent film.
Wings
How the silent film had evolved might be considered by taking a
closer look at the first film to win an Academy Award for best pic-
ture. Wings (1927). In some theaters, as we have seen,
it was
released with Magnascope projection, and a music and effects
score was added that was played variously with sound-on-disc,
sound-on-film, and live accompaniment. But as a visual product
of director William A. Wellman (1896-1975) and his creative per-
sonnel, except for its ambitions as a war spectacle,
it can be
regarded aesthetically as a typical Hollywood product.
What marks Wings is a breadth of stylistic variation that was
soon to be lost in standard talkies. Though the film can attain
stark, even brutal, realism in
its battle scenes,
it also employs a
number of nonrealistic techniques more readily associated with
Soviet avant-garde montage or the impressionistic devices of
French and German cinema than with Hollywood
double expo-
sures or split-screen images, subjective point-of-view shots (a
drunk's out-of-focus vision), trick effects (oversize bubbles rising
from a champagne glass), and symbolic illustrations on intertitles,
such as a drawing of a whirlpool to connote danger or fate.
It may
be that stylistic, technological, or cultural changes would have put
an end to this eclectic stylization, with
its elements of what may
now seem awkward sentimentality, even without the coming of
180

181

sound (recall how Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Alexandrov in their
"Statement on Sound" had complained about filmmakers turning
intertitles into trick shots). But by the late 1920s such devices had
become fairly commonplace in the silent cinema.
Sunrise
The most memorable work of the transition period was
F. W.
Murnau's Sunrise (1927), the German director's first American pro-
duction.
It
is a telling anomaly of film history that this work
is
almost invariably described as a silent film, when in fact
it was
released and widely seen
in
its own time with a Fox Movietone
sound-on-film music and effects track. Sunrise is regarded as one
of the great triumphs of visual aesthetics in silent cinema, though,
technically speaking,
it was a sound film— and when critics write
that the visual effects are so powerful
it
is as
if one can also hear,
they sometimes forget that they did hear.
With a scenario by the German scriptwriter Carl Mayer, Sunrise
recounts a love triangle contrasting city and countryside. A vaca-
tioning city woman— a vamp in the Theda Bara mold— has
ensnared a peasant farmer with beguiling tales of city life (her
words are conjured on screen as impressionistic visual images).
But things turn ugly when she proposes he murder his wife and
make
it appear an accident. The scene where the farmer takes his
wife out on a lake, along with
its inherent drama,
is a key moment
in early sound film. As they leave the shore, the soundtrack several
times mixes the peal of church bells with
its musical themes, and
a church spire can be seen among village buildings in the dis-
tance. He stops the boat, and looms menacingly above her. She
forms her hands in a prayerful gesture. Suddenly he turns away,
and at the same moment bells ring out again on the soundtrack.
This sequence poses significant issues of interpretation, particu-
larly because the film's production history suggests that
it was
completely shot and edited, and Murnau had returned to
Germany, before sound was added. To what extent
is a religious
motif apparent in the images? In the image-sound relationship, do
the bells stop the husband's murderous intent, or are they a sym-
bolic confirmation of his internally directed moral choice? As one
of the earliest recorded music and effects tracks that still survives.
Sunrise calls attention to the strong influence sound can have on
shaping spectator response to the image.
The wife runs away and the husband follows, on a streetcar that
seems magically to whisk them into the city center. They enter a
church where a wedding
is being performed and experience their
own "remarriage." As they leave the church, the scene turns to a
verdant natural backdrop— another of silent cinema's visual pro-
jections of feelings. They stop to kiss, and suddenly the backdrop
fades and they are in the middle of a busy street. Cars slam on
brakes, drivers bang their horns. The soundtrack shifts from harps
and violins to horns, bells, whistles, and even voices yelling "get
out of there."
On the way back a storm comes up and capsizes the boat. The
husband
is safe, but the wife
is missing, and the night scenes of
182

the search for her and her eventual rescue (photographed by
Charles Rosher and Karl Struss) are further instances of Sunrise's
visual power. Scenes such as these were made more effective in
the late silent period by technical developments in film stock and
lighting. Panchromatic negative film, developed for color
photography but which added considerable light sensitivity in
black-and-white, was introduced
in the early 1920s and became
standard in 1927, with an infrared version added
in 1928.
Panchromatic film's light-sensitive properties
let cinematogra-
phers move away from the powerful carbon arc floodlamps
previously used and replace them with incandescent tungsten
bulbs, which gave off a softer, more nondirectional
light.
It also
made possible, as in Sunrise, day-for-night effects— shooting
in sunlight scenes that appear on screen as
if photographed
at night.
The Late Silent Film
Panchromatic film and incandescent tungsten light shifted the late
silent film toward a darker, more subtle image, particulaHy effec-
tive for night scenes and for the play of light and dark contrasts in
the frame, or chiaroscuro (a technical term derived from painting,
describing variations in light and shade). These cinematographic
qualities were especially applied in late silent cinema to enhanc-
ing the almost iconographic status of female stars as objects to be
viewed. One such figure was Lillian Cish, who appeared
in an
important late silent film. The W/nd (19281, directed by Victor

Seastrom, the Americanized name of Swedish director and actor
Victor Sjostrom (see Chapter 6). Another was Greta Garbo, who
through 1929 continued to appear in among the last major
Hollywood films without dialogue, perhaps because of apprehen-
sion about her Swedish accent. In such films as The Kiss (1929),
directed by Jacques Feyder (1894-1948), Garbo's look was also
emphasized through increasing attention to costume styling, here
by the designer Adrian.
Sunrise, The Wind, and The Kiss— Hollywood films made by
European directors— all displayed the range of visual stylization
emblematic of late silent cinema and exemplified by Wings.
There were split-screen images, double exposures, visualizations
of inner thoughts, a blend of symbolism and realism, a stress on
the performance of character psychology, and, above all, careful
attention to the aesthetics of the image through visual contrasts,
shadings, and the play of light. Many of these elements, and par-
ticularly the visual, gave way before the technological demands of
early sound apparatus.

THE ADVENT OF SOUND
The Jazz Singer
"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You ain't heard nothing yet."
These were the prophetic first words of synchronous speech spo-
ken by a performer in a feature fiction motion picture, by Al
lolson (1886-1950)
in The Jazz Singer, released on October 6,
1927. The reason for precision in defining exactly the significance
of Jolson's words lies in the fact that words had been spoken on
screen for more than a year before The Jazz Singer— synchronous
speech in Vitaphone short films and nonsynchronous words on
soundtracks such as that of Sunrise. Jolson's words are important
in cinema history because they were spoken in a compelling fic-
tional narrative. T/ie/azz S/nger convinced spectators that
recorded sound could be more than a short film novelty or feature
accompaniment, that they wanted films to talk.

nothing yet. " A crowd of specta-
tors waits to hear it on opening
night, October 6,
1927, at
Warners' Theatre in New York's
Times Square.
The ground tor Jolson's words had been prepared by months of
activities by both Warner Bros.' sound-on-disc Vitaphone system
and Fox's sound-on-film Movietone. This involved not only begin-
ning to install speakers and amplification
in theaters but also
preparing production facilities to record sound. The technical
conditions for sound recording were worked out in dozens of
short films produced following Vitaphone's premiere in August
1926. Studio stages had to be protected from exterior sounds, and,
because of the noise from
its motors, the camera had to be
soundproofed as well. Before adequate sound-deadening material
was found, the solution was to house the camera inside a large
sound-tight box with a nonreflecting window through which
action could be photographed; this box was the size of a small
room, because
it had to be big enough to hold the technician
who operated the camera, the cinematographer (who was in
overall charge of lighting and camera work), and the film's direc-
tor. These circumstances placed severe restrictions on dollying
and horizontal or vertical panning, the kinds of camera mobility
that were hallmarks of silent film style.
These drawbacks were not particularly noticeable in The jazz
Singer because
it contained only two dialogue scenes, besides
Jolson's songs, in an otherwise nontalking picture. The sentimen-
tal narrative carried spectators swiftly past any subtle technical
critique. The story of a cantor's son who wants to sing jazz songs.

Few legends are more firmly fixed in
motion picture history than the one
immortalized in the 1952 M-G-M musical
Singin' in the Rain: the tempestuous but
squeaky-voiced silent screen star who
gets her (weil-deservedl comeuppance
with the advent of talkies. Some legends
embellish actuality; this one sugarcoats
it.
While there was cautionary anxiety
in
Hollywood about silent performers (par-
ticularly those without stage training)
making the transition to sound, and
reviewers of early talkies passed judg-
^Aiard
ment on voices, very few silent stars lost
their careers because of vocal inade-
quacy. Some did lose their careers, but
for other reasons, which the legend quite
effectively masks.
The emblematic tlgure was John
Gilbert (1897-1936), star of M-G-Ms The
Big Parade (19251 and Greta Garbo's love
interest in Flesh and the Devil, Love (both
1927), and A Woman of Affairs (1929), as
well as briefly off-screen. The principal
issue was not voice, but money. Just
before the advent of sound, Gilbert had
signed a new contract at 5250,000 per
picture. This was an astronomical sum fbr
the time, but competition for leading
pla\ers \sas fierce and he was sought by
other studios.
The problem for Gilbert and M-G-M
was not sound but the economic depres-
sion follouing the 1929 stock market
crash. When the bubble burst on the
excesses of the 1920s, among the real
and imaginar\ tigures on whom the pub-
lic soured uas the character Kpe whom
John Gilbert frequently played: the
romantic lead in swashbuckling costume
dramas of middle-European aristocratic
intrigue. Sound complicated things not
because the dashing heroes had squeaky
voices but because they were asked to
rather than follow generations of ancestors into the synagogue,
spoke powerfully to United States society in the 1920s, with
its
themes of conflict between Old World parents and native-bom
children, as well as the claims of contemporan, popular commer-
cial culture (here, jazz music and theater, but surely also the
movies themselves) against traditional forms.
Jolson's Jakie Rabinowitz becomes Jack Robin in his vaudeville
and stage career, and also falls in love with a woman outside his
own faith— further ramifications on the theme of cultural assimi-
lation. The fact that lolson for his principal song numbers puts on
minstrel-style blackface makeup, complete with nappy hair wig
and oversize white lips, only exaggerates (in a way the filmmakers
almost certainly were unaware of) the cultural contradictions the
film portrays.
Jolson's performance of an African-American stereotype tells us
much about the popular culture of that era. But contemporary
spectators had eyes— and ears— more attuned to the sequence
where Jakie/Jack sings to his mother and sweetly offers to take her
to the amusement park at Coney Island. His father enters the
frame in the background and (in a separate shot) shouts, "Stop!"
Even the soundtrack music seems to falter. The father moves his

looks.
Gilbert's early sound films flopped.
Although his partisans ha\e argued that
M-G-M executives conspired against him,
it seems unlikeK that the studio set out
deliberately to lose money on Gilbert's
films. More plausible is that they were
unable to find a workable formula for him
and unwilling to put much mone\
in
unpromising projects aireadx saddled
with his huge salar\. Rugged t\ pes with
an outdoor, working-class aura, like Clark
Cable, were supplanting him—and at
much lower salaries. Gilbert made his last
film at M-G-M in 1933;
still
in his thirties,
he died of a heart attack in 1936.

it marked a return to filmed stage
plays, because actors were able to move more freely in theaters
than on sound stages. Yet few spectators complained, and more
'all-talkies' quicklv followed.
Sound Improvements
The difficulties involved in making early talkies were quickly over-
come. While engineers worked on developing cameras with
quieter motors, a temporarv expedient for existing cameras was
found bv covering them with thick lavers of sound-insulating
material, called blimps or "bungalows," and the cameras came
out of the oversize box. Then thev were mounted on batterv
operated dollies with rubber tires, which restored panning and
camera mobilitv'. Microphones were hung from long arms, called
booms, which dangled out of camera range above the scene
being filmed; these were also mounted on dollies, so freedom of
movement was restored to performers. Trucks were fitted \\ ith
sound-recording equipment for location work. The Mitchell
Recording Camera vsas developed which could record both image
and sound on a single film strip and was used particularly bv
nevN-sreel companies as the> made the transition to sound along
189

with feature films. Within a year or two after The Jazz S;n^erand
Lights of New York, sound film had completely recovered from the
technical or aesthetic deficiencies the early talkies had demon-
strated in comparison with silent cinema.
THE ART OF SOUND
Talkies, said director Rouben Mamoulian (1898-1987), were not
movies. A stage director, Mamoulian was approached by
Paramount's Long Island, New York, studio to assist film actors in
learning to speak dialogue. He preferred to direct a film, and his
first production. Applause ^929), was among the earliest to restore
movement to the "talking" picture.
Af^fplause
The film's story concerns an aging burlesque queen who contin-
ues to perform in order to support her daughter's education
in a
faraway convent. The key scene from a technological standpoint
occurs when the daughter, at seventeen, returns from the convent
to her mother's seedy show business milieu. The mother sits at the
girl's bedside and sings her a burlesque song in lullaby style, while
to herself the daughter whispers a prayer. Mamoulian, as he
recalled
it, wanted two things the talkies had not before done: a
moving camera shot of the scene, and dual microphones to pick
up both the song and the prayer. The camera box was placed on
rollers, and two mikes put in place.
Though the scene lasts neaHy five minutes as a single shot,
it
has none of the immobile, static feeling that made the long takes
of early "all-talkies" seem interminable. The scene begins in
medium long shot, the camera gradually moves in to close-ups of
mother singing and daughter praying, pulls back to a medium
close-up of the pair, then back again to the medium long shot

recordings were overlapped by laying one negative track on top of
the other and printing the positive as one sound strip.
Applause is tilled with many such sound innovations. Sound

Applause is remarkable for the range of its sound experimenta-
tion. In the American cinema, few sound films would strive for
such a variety of effects. Overall the goal was sound that
appeared
"natural" or realistic, with impressionistic sound devices
reserved for special occurrences. (Mamoulian, however, contin-
ued to experiment. In the op)ening sequence of his 1932 film Love
Me Tonight, the morning sounds of Paris form into a musical

Hallelujah
Among the sound techniques demonstrated in Applause that were
to become standard were location shooting and off-screen sound.
Both were exemplified in an unusual film of 1929, Hallelujah,
directed b\ King Vidor, perhaps the first major production of a
Hollywood studio featuring an entirely black cast. Some of the
outdoor scenes were shot silent with postsynchronized effects
added back in the studio, but there were also exterior scenes
recorded with synchronous dialogue. In these, Vidor laid down a
continuous soundtrack, consisting of music or speech coming
from definite on-screen locations, and then played this sound over
a variety of different shot setups related to, but not showing, the
sound source. The result was an expansion of the visual field, an
increase in the variety of images, while maintaining a steady
soundtrack that frequently comes from off-screen. (Once off-

Alfred Hitchcock's
Blackmail (1929), his first and
Britain's second sound film, ranks
with Applause for its inventive
early use of sound. One instance
can be described as subjective or
"point-of-hearing" sound. A
woman has gone to a man's flat
and, resisting his advances,
stabbed him to death. After
returning home, in the morning at
breakfast she encounters a neigh-
borhood gossip commenting on
the discovery of the victim: "A
good clean, honest whack over
the head with a brick is one thing.
There's something British about
that. But knives. ..." The camera
pans from the speaker to the
woman, then cuts to a close-up of
her, and the soundtrack begins to
represent the woman's auditory
perception: the talk fades to unin-
telligibility except for repetitions
of the word "knife. " Her father's
off-screen voice breaks into her
consciousness, saying,
"Alice, cut
us a bit of bread, will you?" The
camera pans down to show her
hand, picking up the bread knife.
The hand flinches on the next rep-
etition of "knife" and another
"knife" sounds like a shout, star-
tling her and sending the knife
clattering across the room. Anny
Ondra plays the knifeholder
screen sound became familiar,
it no longer required an establish-
ing on-screen shot; the source for off-screen sound could be
left
to the spectator's imagination.)
SOUND AND LANGUAGE
Sound obviously had implications for the notion of cinema as a
universal language. The advent of talkies threatened to render the
medium no more widely comprehensible than the babel of
tongues
it had promised to overcome. Some producers at first
attempted to deal with this problem by shooting films in several
languages, replacing performers on the same set in consecutive
takes. This soon proved economically impractical, and other steps
were taken to overcome language barriers.
In Europe, films in for-
eign languages were commonly dubbed (a term derived from
"vocal doubling," to indicate the postsynchronization of a voice
replacing the original), with native speakers lip-synching new dia-
logue. In the United States, where the audience for foreign films
was largely drawn from immigrants and cinema aesthetes, films
more generally were played in their original versions, with
English-language translations of dialogue printed as subtitles
across the screen bottom.
The Blue Angel
Perhaps the most famous dual-language production was Der
blaue Engel/The Blue Ange/ (1930), which
still circulates in both
German and English-language versions. Directed
in Berlin by the
Austrian-American Josef von Sternberg, the film was a coproduc-
tion of Germany's Ufa and Hollywood's Paramount. The Blue
Angel was more distinctive for
its psychological portraits than for
its use of sound. Emil Jannings, back in Germany after his brief
but highly successful stint in Hollywood silents, plays Professor
Immanuel Rath, a straitlaced teacher destroyed by his attraction to
Lola Lola, a nightclub singer. The German actress who portrayed
Lola Lola, Marlene Dietrich (1901-1992), accompanied Sternberg
on his return to Hollywood, and a series of pictures Sternberg
directed
in the early 1930s launched her career as one of the most
important stars in American cinema.
Early Sound in Germany
In Germany, the leading directors of Weimar cinema came later
to sound than their United States counterparts, but their early
efforts were significant. G. W. Pabst's Kameradschaft
("Comradeship," 1931), a didactic film advocating working-class
unity between German and French coal miners on the border of

freely employing both languages on the soundtrack. The film
is
also visually among the most fluid of early sound films.
Its theme
of breaking down barriers between peoples
is conveyed in the
cinematography of Fritz Arno Wagner, emphasizing spatial mobil-
ity through almost constant panning and tracking.
M.
Fritz Lang turned to sound with M (1931
1— only his third film
since Metropolis— and produced one of the most important
works in cinema history. M has been freighted by the judgment of
some critics that
it portends the imminent triumph of fascism in
Germany, but any single interpretation
is likeK
to be inadequate
for this enigmatic, elusive film.
If there
is any clear frame for
analysis
it may lie in an intertextual, authorial perspective,
in
Lang's long-standing preoccupation— predating his collaboration
with scriptwriter Thea von Harbou— with conflicts between
social authority and a secret criminal underwoHd. In this sense, M
continues some of the central concerns of The Spiders and Dr.
Mabuse the Gambler (see Chapters 4 and 6).
M's narrative focus
is a series of murders of children. As public
hysteria mounts, the police systematically, but fruitlessly, interro-
gate the criminal subculture. Leaders of criminal organizations
call a summit meeting— famously intercut with a meeting of
195

police chiefs, so that the two smoke-filled rooms soon appear
interchangeable— where they determine, for the sake of their
operations, to find the killer themselves. Efficiently they locate
and capture him, then stage a trial
in the cellar of an abandoned
building. There, the killer, portrayed by Peter Lorre (1904-1964),
gives harrowing testimony of his own inner torments, almost
swaying the criminal spectators to sympathy. As the killer tries to
escape the police arrive, and the film ends with a most ambigu-
ous restoration of social authority.
8.32-8.34.
Along with
its mas-
terly use of sound, Fritz Lang's M
(1931) was a visual tour de force.
Peter Lorre, playing a child mur-
derer,
is reflected in a toy-shop
window with a prospective victim
(above right). Later, with the crim-
inal underground on his trail (they
want to alleviate harassment from
the police), he is marked with the
Incriminating "M" when a blind
beggar recognizes his tell-tale
whistle (above). Captured and
tried by the underground in an
abandoned factory (right), the
murderer gives a harrowing
account of his compulsion. An
intertextual footnote: Gustav
Crundgens, who played the crim-
inal leader Schraenker (in bowler
hat), became head of an impor-
tant state theater during the Nazi
era; a fictional version of his
career was dramatized in a 1981
Hungarian film, Mephisto,
directed by Istvan Szabo.

Already a major director, Lang's work with sound demonstrated
significant development as a filmmaker. Where performance and
character delineation had been among the weaker elements of
Lang's silent films, M features complex performances by, among
others, Lorre, Custav GrCindgens (1899-1963) as Shraenker the
criminal chief, and Otto Wernicke '1893-1965; as police inspec-
tor Lohmann, that go far beyond their stereotypical roles.
In visual style, sound enabled Lang to expand his concern with
the relation between the screen frame and off-screen space. M is
among the first films to modulate sound as a marker of distance
and as a unit in the montage construction of a sequence. As a
mother calls the name of a child, the sound of her voice grows
fainter as each shot change reveals a place farther away where
she cannot be found (since each space is empty, the subjective
effect of the lengthening distance from the mrjther
is experienced
only by the spectator, who becomes a stand-in for the absent
child, and for whom the apprehension of danger grows with every
new location). The final shot that symbolically confirms the child
as the killer's latest victim
is soundless. 'One should nrjte here not
only Lang's use of sound but the cinematography of, once again,
Fritz Arno Wagner, who in the same year shrjt Kameradschaft ior

Later, sound
is used to identify the murderer when a blind beggar
hears, off-screen, the killer's characteristic whistle. With M, Fritz
Lang created the sound cinema's first masterpiece.

When talk about the movies turns ethe-
I
real—when words like magic and myth,
glamour and legend crop up— it imme-
diately evokes, for most people, images from 1930s Hollywood.
Astaire and Rogers airborne in a dance step. Carbo in a lover's
embrace. Judy Garland, as Dorothy, and her
little dog Toto on the
yellow brick road. Grant and Hepburn chasing a leopard through
Connecticut. These and scores of similar scenes from American
films of the 1930s are almost invariably the associations that come
to mind when we think of movies not only as enormously suc-
cessful mass entertainment but as creators of a style of living
of dressing, of speaking, of romancing—that affected people
throughout the world, and continues to exert its power.
Yet the world of images that Hollywood constructed—the magi-
cal and glamorous part of
it, at any rate— was far removed from
the surrounding world of actuality. The 1930s began with the most
severe economic depression of the century and ended with the
outbreak of a devastating world war. American motion picture
companies were affected by these disruptions as were all institu-
tions and peoples. Nearly all the Hollywood studios suffered
financial losses during the Great Depression, which struck soon
after the companies had borrowed substantial sums to finance the
conversion to sound. Paramount, Fox, and RKO were among the
firms whose management was temporarily controlled by courts,
banks, or other debt-holders, while filmmaking policies generally
continued
in the hands of experienced studio executives. The stu-
dios were further challenged during the period by accusations
against the morality of their films and the legality of their business
practices.
THE DREAM MACHINE
Still, the Hollywood "dream machine" functioned smoothly in the
public's eyes;
its attraction during an era of social and political
crisis can surely be explained by spectators' desires to "escape"
for a few hours their own and the world's troubles into a make-
believe place where happy endings were the rule. But that wish
is
not limited just to the 1930s. More specific to the era were the
growth of mass society and the increasing cultural importance of
popular commercial entertainment. Though movies had demon-
strated wide appeal
in earlier decades, particularly among young
people, the arrival of sound films, coupled with a crisis
in tradi-
tional values caused by the depression's impact on the economy
and social
life, catapulted the film industry to a position of
acknowledged cultural power
it had not possessed before.
New Talent
Talking pictures— and later, political repression overseas— also
brought to Hollywood new waves of creative and technical talent.
The need for dialogue lured across the continent playwrights,
journalists, novelists, stage performers, and directors to motion
picture work; prominent examples include director George Cukor
(1899-1983), writer-director Preston Sturges (1898-1959), and
performers Paul Muni (1895-1967) and Katharine Hepburn (b.
1907). In Germany, meanwhile, the rise of the fascist Nazi move-
ment to political power sent many of that country's leading film
personnel into exile, some elsewhere in Europe, many to the
United States. The presence in Southern California of refugee
artists in such other fields as literature and music helped to turn
200

the once-isolated movie "colony" into a center where sonne of the
outstanding American and European figures in the literary and
visual arts turned their hands to the popular art of American
movies.
Continuity and Stability
Given the range of transformations experienced by the American
motion picture industry in this period, what
is also remarkable
is
its capacity for continuity and stability. This was most evident at
the top. At several leading film companies, including M-G-M,
Warner Bros., and Columbia Pictures, management remained
in
the same hands for decades; a generation of showmen, fabled as
the "movie moguls," ran the studios from the 1920s, and in some
cases even earlier, right through to the 1950s. Much the same was
true of behind-the-camera personnel: directors, cinematogra-
phers, designers, editors, and other craft workers moved almost
en masse from silent to sound filmmaking with few disruptions.
The consolidations and mergers that occurred
in the late 1920s
with the transition to sound
left an industry that, despite the diffi-
cult depression period, appeared
in
its general structure almost
exactly the same at the end of the 1930s as at the beginning.
be dropped) to gossip columnists. This form of "grooming" often
had
little to do with actual development of screen performance;
in practice, contract players outnumbered good roles, and the
production system depended on the repetition of character types
rather than individuated performances. Any contract player who
broke through to become a star, though well recompensed by any
standard, was nevertheless grossly underpaid in terms of box
office value to the studio, and not even the highest-paid stars of
the 1930s earned salaries comparable to what leading stars had
been paid
in silent days.
THE CLASSICAL ERA
The developing star system of the 1930s marks one of the key ele-
ments of what has frequently been called the classical era of
Hollywood cinema. As applied to the American film industry,
"classic" and "classical" are loose terms with several meanings
and periodizations. Most fundamentally they refer to the mode of
production and aesthetic styles fostered by the vertically inte-
grated studios—those controlling not only production but also
distribution and exhibition— that took shape in the 1910s and
GENRES
The Star System
The profession most affected by the advent of talkies, quite obvi-
ously, was acting (see Chapter 8). Nearly every studio added
several dozen stage-trained players to
its roster during 1929-30;
many flopped, but a few quickly became stars, including Spencer
Tracy (1900-1967) at Fox, Irene Dunne (1898-1990) at RKO, and
James Cagney (1899-1986) at Warner Bros. The arrival of so
many new performers brought changes in the star system. With
beginning players, starting from scratch, the studios sought to gain
firmer control over careers and salaries than
in the 1920s, when
stars' salaries had soared and a few had gained considerable
power to approve scripts and casting decisions. As the sound era
began, virtually every aspirant for leading roles was obliged to
become a "contract player" with a specific studio; only later in
the 1930s did a few outstanding stars, such as Barbara Stanwyck
(1907-1990) and Gary Grant (1904-1986), strike out on their own
as successful "free-lancers."
The host of stage players who came to Hollywood signed con-
tracts that by theater standards were generous, and to the average
person a fortune, but by previous Hollywood norms the salaries
were a mere pittance. As contract players they were generally
bound for up to seven years, but the studios had frequent
"options" to drop them before the contract expired. They could
be loaned out to other studios (at a profit to their employer) and
suspended without pay
if they refused a role. The studios shaped
their public images through publicity staffs who orchestrated cov-
erage in the press and fan magazines and leaked items (not
always favorable,
if performers were making trouble or about to
operated until the 1950s. The "classical Hollywood system" ulti-
mately broke up under the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's
1948 decision in the "Paramount Case," which declared vertical
integration illegal (see Chapter 14), as well as the challenge of
television.
The concept of "classical" stresses determinative norms and
uniform practices. Therefore many who use
it refer only to the
studio era of sound cinema (dated 1928 to 1955), thus ignoring
important transformations such as the shift, with the coming of
sound, away from symbolic and impressionistic stylization.
"Classical"
is more useful as a general term than as a descriptive
and interpretative category.
It helps to call attention to the preva-
lence of institutional procedures and styles; but
if applied too
sweepingly,
it hinders recognition of variety, change, and the
multiple struggles that go into the making of individual works.
To determine which
is more important, continuity or change,
is
a recurrent issue in studies of the past. Perhaps the key word for
American movies in this era
is adaptability. The major companies
and most of their important personnel weathered the changeover
to talkies. They survived the Great Depression. As the 1930s went
on, they rode the wave of an expanding popular commercial cul-
ture to greater profits, popularity, and social influence. Since the
1930s, subsequent waves have carried American motion pictures
to both new depths and new heights. But at no other time in their
history have movies played so pervasive and significant a role in
cultural definition and consciousness. That
is a major reason why
the myths and legends of the 1930s remain so vivid.

GENRE DEVELOPMENTS
The impact of sound on Hollywood's genre system, as with every-
thing else, was contradictory. Things stayed the same and things
became different. Few
if any of the dominant silent film genres
were adversely affected by the advent of talkies. Conversely, few
if any new genres were inaugurated as a result of sound (the one
major exception was the musical with recorded sound;
it drove
out the staged musical prologues that had been an important
exhibition feature in the silent period). There were developments
within genres, to be sure, but in general these derived as much
from cultural and industrial factors as from new technologies; the
principal exception was comedy, where sound technology min-
gled with cultural changes to shape a new, highly verbal comedy
style.
Gangster Films
The gangster genre, for example, responded significantly in the
early 1930s to an increased public concern about crime and to
an emerging literary treatment of legendary gang leaders of the
Prohibition era. At least two dozen gangster pictures appeared
in 1930, capped by the First National production Little Caesar,
directed by Mervyn LeRoy (1900-1987).
It was followed the next
year by The Public Enemy, a Warner Bros, picture directed by
William A. Wellman, and
in 1932 by Scarface, a Howard Hughes
film directed by Howard Hawks (1896-1977). Together these
comprise the trio of works that has defined over the decades the
eady depression era gangster film.
All three films aroused strong public controversy. Reviewers
and moralists were concerned about the graphic depiction of vio-
lence, as well as the possibility that powerful performances could
turn fictional criminals into romantic heroes, whatever their vio-
lent fates. Each work indeed offered powerful performances in
their gangster roles, launching three stage actors toward major
movie careers. Edward G. Robinson (1893-1973) played Rico
Bandello in Little Caesar, James Cagney was Tom Powers in The
Public Enemy, and Paul Muni portrayed Tony Camonte in
Scarface. This last film was delayed, added to, and
in some states
reedited before
it was allowed to be released,
in part because of
Muni's disturbing characterization of the gangster as grotesque
and abnormal.
From that era forward—through decades of the genre's undi-
minished popularity— commentators have pondered the question
of gangster films' social meaning. Do they encourage criminal
behavior or do they suppress
it? Are the gangsters the equivalent
in modern popular culture of figures in Greek drama or
Shakespearen plays, doomed overreachers who play out their fated

destinies, representing excesses of desire and ambition for power-
less spectators to experience vicariously their rise and fall? In an
essay on "The Gangster as Tragic Hero," critic Robert Warshow
wrote, "He
is what we want to be and who we are afraid we may
become."'
Horror Films
The horror genre also surged in popular appeal in the early 1930s.
Should we attempt to characterize spectator identification with
movie monsters? The actor Lon Chaney had dominated Holly-
wood horror films in the 1920s with his remarkable array of
makeup and disguises. With Chaney 's untimely death
in August
1930, at forty-seven, after making only one sound film, the genre
was open to new directions in the talkie era. What was perhaps
most unusual about the first of the classic sound horror films
Dracula (1931
1, a Universal production directed by Tod Browning
(1880-1962)— was that the vampire, far from being a grotesque as
in Murnau's Nosteratu, looked quite normal. As played by the
Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi (1882-1956), the fiend's other-
worldly character was emphasized by lighting his eyes while
leaving the rest of his face in shadow and by his heavy middle-
European accent, which became the stock-in-trade of a thousand
imitators delivering such legendary lines as
"I never drink
.
.
.
wine."

British actor who henceforth would be a fixture of the horror
genre.
These famed works (based on nineteenth-century novels that
had already been made into silent films) have generated over the
decades something like subgenres in themselves. Their countless
remakes, variations, and parodies include Blacula (1972), about
an African prince who passes through Transylvania and becomes
a vampire, and Mel Brooks's comedy Young Frankenstein (1974),

Lromotion and 1
Hollywood motion picture companies
had a word for their promotional and
publicity efforts: exploitation. Much of
this activity was delegated to local movie
theater operators, who were sent "press
books" for individual films that contained
ideas for tie-in events, such as contests for
patrons with film-related themes, and fea-
ture stories complete with headlines that
could be offered to local newspapers. In
the studio era of the 1930s, however,
publicity endeavors became more closely
controlled by the production companies,
who increasingly promoted not only indi-
vidual titles but a glamorous image of the
movie world.

The work of portrait photog-
raphers and gossip columnists
alike often found outlet in
Hollywood fan magazines. Their
contents were generally carefully
controlled by studio publicists,
who knew well enough, however,
that movie fans needed not just
good news but conflict, pathos,
and mystery in the stars' life sto-
ries just as in the fictional roles
they played. Photoplay was the
first of the fan magazines,
founded in 1911; by the 1930s
readers could choose among
such other titles as Motion
Picture, Silver Screen, Screenland,
and Modern Screen, which fea-

up to accommodate throngs of

was another exciting event, com-
bining professional and personal
publicity, as gossip columnists
noted who accompanied whom
as the stars arrived in limousines.
Premieres such as this one for All
This and Heaven Too (1940) at
the Carthay Circle Theatre lured
tourists to Hollywood, but other
cities also got the opportunity to
host premieres which the stars
attended, and local exhibitors
were encouraged to stage their
own, with local celebrities.

perhaps the definitive send-up. Given the historical importance of
these early 1930s horror films,
it
is surprising how quaint they
now appear— in contrast not only to the genre's truly shocking
evolution, but to the enduring power and freshness of early 1930s
gangster films. Their setting
is Hollywood's version of English
upper-class
life (or in Frankenstein, Hollywood's version of the
English upper class masquerading as German aristocrats). Despite
their potential for disturbing visions and the occasional horror
they depict, both films end happily, with none of the principal
"normal" characters very much affected. Mina, the ambiguous
and tragic heroine of Nosferatu, survives the vampire's bite in
Dracula and weds her fiance as
if only a small inconvenience had
occurred.
The Musical
By the early 1930s the new genre of recorded sound musicals had
already gone through one cycle, and
its staying power seemed
uncertain. With the exception of Applause and a few others, early
sound musicals had been hampered by restricted camera move-
ment and the variety format taken over from stage musicals. The
genre made a decisive recovery when Warner Bros, inaugurated
in 1933 a series of musicals with show-business stories featuring
dances and ensemble staging created by choreographer Busby
Berkeley (1895-1976).
The first, 42nd Street, directed by Lloyd Bacon (1890-1955),
told the classic tale of the "raw kid out of the chorus" who gets
her big chance when the leading lady breaks her ankle. "You're
going out a youngster," says the director to young Peggy Sawyer
(played by Ruby Keeler), "but you've got to come back a star."
Besides such familiar, but compelling, stories, the Warner musi-
cals gave free reign to Berkeley's dance spectacles. He completely
freed the musical from adherence to stage conventions; having
tried out overhead shots of dancers in several earlier musicals, he
advanced this style in 42nd Street, and
it reached full flower in
such films as Cold Diggers of 1933 and Footlight Parade (both
1933) and Dames (1934). 42nc/Sfreef also offers a tracking shot
with a male vocalist while the camera passes between the legs of
female dancers. These and similar images from other films have
rtiade Berkeley's dances prime subjects for studies concerned
with the mechanization, objectification, and segmentation of
women's bodies in cinema.
Almost simultaneously with Berkeley's triumphs, a different
musical style, which placed a more contemplative emphasis on
individual performances, was emerging in the Fred Astaire
(1899-1987) and Ginger Rogers (b. 1911) musicals made at RKO.
(Rogers personified the transition, having appeared in 42nd Street
and Gold Diggers of 1933). Fred and Ginger—we seem to know
no other Hollywood couple so familiarly on a first-name basis
danced together in nine films between 1933 and 1939, to music
by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, and
other leading popular composers, with dance direction by
Hermes Pan (1905-1990). Their most prominent successes (and
enduring favorites) included Top F/af (1935), directed by Mark
Sandrich (1900-1945), and Swing Time (1937), directed by
George Stevens (1904-1975).
Comedy
Last in this brief survey of genres, comedy received a strong boost
from new writers and performers who came in with sound.
Representative among the former was playwright Samson
Raphaelson (1896-1983), whose stage play served as source for
The jazz Singer, Raphaelson brought his sardonic dialogue to
director Ernst Lubitsch's sophisticated comedies twitting European
upper-class society, notably Trouble in Paradise (1932), a
Paramount film featuring Miriam Hopkins, Kay Francis, and
Herbert Marshall. Inimitable among the latter was the vaudeville
and Broadway comedy team the Marx Brothers (Croucho, Harpo,
Chico, and Zeppo). The five anarchic comedies they made for

THE PRODUCTION CODE
AND ITS EFFECTS
Between 1933 and 1935 most of the Hollywood film studios that
had suffered financial difficulties in the Great Depression's early
years began to regain their stability. Their struggles shifted from
the economic realm to the social and moral. The movies, as carri-
ers of modernity into traditional communities, had always
encountered hostility from some social groups.
In the early 1920s
the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association
(MPPDA, later renamed Motion Picture Association of America)
appointed as
its president Postmaster-General Will H. Hays

(1879-19541, whose task \%as to tend oft" state censorship and
build good will toward movies. The coming of sound, however,
again exacerbated public concern about movie moralit\' and
social impact.
In 1930, as a counterweight to outside pressure and efforts to
impose federal government censorship ion top of alreadv existing
state censorship boards!, the mo\ie industry strengthened
its self-
regulator\' mechanisms, setting up a Production Code and an
office to monitor scripts and completed films. The Code offered
general principles, such as "No picture shall be produced which
will lower the moral standards of those who see it," and twelve
sections dealing w ith specific prohibitions concerning topics such
as crime, sex, profanit\, and costuming las examples, no nudit\,
and no offensive references to a character's national origin).
Economic pressures, howe\er, led producers to more license
rather than
less: gangster \ iolence, risque dialogue, and sexual
candor were exploited as lures to retain a diminishing audience.
The Ha\s Office had established a Studio Relations Committee in
HolJNAvood to monitor Code compliance, but b\ 1933 critics
regarded
its efforts as ineffecti\e and religious groups threatened
to bovcott mo\ ies.
Production Code Administration
In response to this crisis, Ha\s in 1934 set up a new watchdog
bodv, the Production Code Administration tPCAi, headed bv
Joseph
I. Breen (1890-19651, with power to issue an MPPDA seal
to films deemed in compliance w ith the Code: member compa-
nies of the MPPDA agreed not to release am film w ithout a seal.
Nevertheless, conflicts between the PCA and producers quickls
became heated, as in the exchanges over the RKO production Of
Human Bondage [^93A), adapted from W. Somerset Maugham's
novel of a sexual obsession.
"It deals definitek w ith tangled sex
relations which are highK offensive to the rank and file of our
patrons," the PCA noted in an internal memo. Let them "stop

nnemo, "and
let distinguished, fine novels be produced
in picture
form."- After all this, the finished film was approved as conform-
ing to the Code and presented a stirring performance by a young
actress, Bette Davis (1908-1989), that launched her toward star
status.
The Woman's Film
With stringent Code enforcement (the PCA carefully scrutinized
scripts and costume drawings at the preproduction stage and pre-
viewed every finished film), broader cultural changes, and
different ambitions among producers and filmmakers, American
movies after 1934 moved closer to the social mainstream,
enhancing their role as leaders in representing and defining issues
of ideology and values. A case in point
is the woman's film. This
traditional genre was dominated
in the early 1930s by a cycle
dealing with the "fallen woman." After 1933
it shifted back
toward more conventional society.
One of the last among the genre's controversial early 1930s
works was Christopher Strong, a 1933 RKO production directed
by Dorothy Arzner (1900-1979), Hollywood's only woman direc-
tor in the first sound years. Arzner began her career at Paramount
as a film editor and scriptwriter and directed her first picture while
still
in her twenties. She made eleven films for Paramount from
1927 to 1932 and six more at other studios over the following
decade; many of her works feature a strong, independent-minded
woman who frequently meets a tragic end.
In Christopher Strong
this figure
is portrayed by Katharine Hepburn
in her second
screen role; a famous woman aviator, she falls in love with a mar-
ried man, becomes pregnant, and takes her own
life by removing
her oxygen mask during a flight that sets an altitude record. (Strict
Code enforcement would have prohibited the pregnancy and the
suicide, and the PCA later banned the film from reissue.)
Even as
it began to steer away from some subjects, however,
the woman's genre— now more commonly called melodrama
inevitably touched on others quite as contentious. Imitation of
Lifen934), directed by )ohn M. Stahl (1886-1950) at Universal,
treated race relations. A widowed white woman (Claudette
Colbert) and her African-American housekeeper (Louise Beavers)
establish a successful business selling a pancake mix based on the
black woman's secret recipe. Each has problems with a daughter.
The housekeeper's daughter
is so light-skinned ("Her pappy was a
very, very light colored man," the mother explains) that she wants
to pass for white. She renounces her mother, who dies of a bro-
ken heart. The widow's daughter falls in love with the same man
210

her mother plans to marry, so the mother sends him away. The
genre focused on the broader concerns society had demarcated
as women's issues, including marriage, family, and children.
Though sometimes dismissed as "weepies," melodramas dealt
with fundamental human themes, even
if considerably masked,
as in Imitation of Lite's covert allusion to sexual relations between
whites and blacks.
Screwball Comedy
Also at least partly attributable to the Production Code was a shift
in the comedy genre after 1934 away from the ethnic, often vulgar
style of early sound comedies drawing on vaudeville stage con-
ventions (though the Marx Brothers continued to thrive, their
connoisseurs lamented that they had been tamed) toward a new
type of romantic comedy. Called screwball comedies, these films
often featured quirky members of the affluent classes, held out
the possibility of cross-class romance, or gave wealthy characters
lessons in human values. A prototype was

picture budgets) to become one of Hollywood's "majors."
Columbia's most important contract director, Capra was develop-
ing a special style of comedy based on everyday
life, and
loan-outs from major studios (Gable from M-G-M, Colbert from
Paramount) gave him leading players for whom he could craft
innovative roles. Gable plays a newspaper reporter who encoun-
ters Colbert, an heiress fleeing from an undesired wedding, on a
long-distance bus ride. What begins as a scoop turns into
romance on the American road.
MY MAN GODFREY. One of the most unusual screwball
comedies was My Man Godfrey (1936), a Universal production
directed by Gregory La Cava (1892-1952).
It begins at a garbage
dump along New York's East River. People
in evening clothes, tak-
ing part in a scavenger hunt for a charity event, step out of a
roadster to look for a "forgotten man"— a 1930s term for the
unemployed and homeless. A derelict, after pushing one woman
into an ash heap, agrees to go along with her sister. His dignity
and sardonic humor impress her, and she hires him as butler for
the family's Fifth Avenue mansion. The wealthy family turn out to
be spoiled, selfish, and inane— "empty-headed nitwits," as the
derelict-turned-butler calls them.
He,
it turns out,
is also from a rich family; he landed in the
dump through despondency over a broken love affair. Through his
butler work he pulls his
life together and
in the end opens a posh
nightclub, the Dump, on the dump site to provide employment,
food, and shelter to "forgotten men." The film's predominant
point, however,
is not that the poor are redeemable, but that the
wealthy are.
HOWARD HAWKS.
In the later 1930s director Howard Hawks
emerged as a leading creative figure in the screwball subgenre.
His films were notable for the questioning approach they took
toward gender issues. Relations between women and men,
if they
sometimes appeared to be warlike, actually depended in his films
on recognition of life's playfulness. This gave performers an

Fr/ctay (1940), a Columbia production that remade a hit play and
movie, The Front Page, Hawks changed one of the characters
from male to female. Editor Walter Burns (Grant) and reporter
Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) became ex-husband and wife,
making their battles more focused than
in previous versions on
the vexed, yet creative, relationship between love and work.

you could imagine yourself the same type as a star, but must
always remember that only one in 100,000 succeeded
in
Hollywood.
''Tie-up?s''
For the motion picture companies, movies on screen accounted
for only one part— granted, the first and most important— of the
relationship they sought to build with audiences. Movies served
as the foundation of a cultural concept: screen stories were make-
believe, and their stars were distant and different, yet those stories
and stars could be vicariously emulated. One could acquire the
sheet music (from a subsidiary of the movie studio) and play the
songs the stars sang. One could purchase modestly priced
"knockoff" dresses based on outfits worn by the stars and com-
plexion and makeup products they endorsed. One could buy
furniture, rugs, drapes, lamps— furnish a whole household
modeled on the rooms the stars lived in on-screen. The motion
picture experience extended beyond the theater into everyday
living through the world of "tie-ups," products drawn from the
screen or promoted by film personalities. (However, movies in
that era rarely displayed brand items, because exhibitors protested
that they did not share in fees paid by manufacturers.)
Mise-en-sdne
This cultural and economic emphasis had an unmistakable effect
on American motion picture style in the 1930s.
It was a significant
reason why the sound cinema moved away from the stylizations
and symbolization common
in 1920s silent film. Technique less
and less called attention to itself.
In the 1930s films discussed
here—works that have stood the test of time and remain lively
and entertaining— there are nevertheless few occasions to
exclaim over virtuoso cutting sequences or extraordinary cine-
matography. Superior editing and camera work are indeed amply
present, but at the service of illusion and presentation, of the real-
ity of make-believe. Hollywood's distinctive film style of the
1930s lay not in how one viewed but in what was viewed.
It
marked a triumph of mise-en-scene.
Costume Design
The industry spoke of production values, a term that referred
principally to costumes and sets. In a historical epic like The
Charge of the Light Brigade, a 1936 Warner Bros, film directed by
Michael Curtiz (1888-1962), this meant period gowns, uniforms,
and massed extras in ballroom and battle scenes. But for the eco-
nomic purposes of "tie-ups"
it connoted up-to-date fashions
in
clothes and decor. Edith Head (1907-1981) at Paramount, Adrian
at M-G-M (see Chapter 8), and Orry-Kelly (1897-1964) at Warner
Bros, were among the leading costume designers of the period.
Costume design played a significant role in narrative, representa-
tion, and character development in 1930s movies, and
it carried
over to the commercial marketing of clothing based on movie
models; publicity stills of actress Joan Crawford (1908-1977), for
example, carried detailed captions explaining the stylistic features
of the dresses she wore in her films.
Art Direction
Among the principal art directors were Cedric Gibbons at
M-G-M, Hans Dreicr (1885-1966) at Paramount, William Darling
(1882-1963) at Fox, Anton Grot (1884-1974) at Warner Bros.,
Van Nest Polglase (1898-1968) at RKO, and Richard Day

when French critics of the 1950s debated
issues of film "authorship" (see Chapters
16 and
17) they emphasized the director's
role in shaping a film's visual style,
its
mise-en-scene. In Hollywood's 1930s
mode of production, however, though a
director's influence was paramount over
such elements as camera movement and
the blocking of actors, a considerable
part of a film's visual style might be
established even before a director was
assigned. After a script was approved,
responsibility for translating
it into a
visual design would be placed in the
hands of the art department. Now that
notions of authorship have begun to
encompass not just directors, but the
collaborative nature of crafting a film,
the art director's contribution deserves
further attention, as these three
examples attest.

men in constructing this set at a

studio publicity, a substantial sum
at that time. Goosson and

and designers were seeking aesthetic styles expressive of twenti-
eth-century forms—the city, the machine, abstraction as a mode
of representing reality. Motion picture art directors tended to shift
these concepts into realms of pleasure and fantasy. On vast sound

Producer David O. Selznick

Technicolor than any other
Hollywood executive of the
1930s. His (and Hollywood's)
great triumph of the era was
Cone with the Wind, the epic of
the United States Civil War based
on Margaret Mitchell's novel.
Selznick went through three direc-
tors (Victor Fleming, the middle
one, got the credit) and "author-
ship" of the film could justly he
ascribed to Selznick, production
designer William Cameron Men-
zies, and art director Lyie Wheeler
(all three won Academy Awards,
as did Fleming; the film gained
ten in all). The famous burning of

clear the lot for other sets, with

stages they built nightclubs, ocean liners, apartment interiors
(even the occasional office) of a size, scale, and lavishness that
actuality rarely,
if ever, matched.
In their early decades American
motion picture producers had been criticized for failing accurately
to depict the settings where fashionable people lived. By the
1930s such criticism was moot: the movies were in the vanguard,
themselves helping to shape the fashion standards of the time.
Color
Beginning in mid-decade the studios worked color back into
their visual repertory, though slowly and selectively. RKO in 1935
produced the first full-length feature film using three-strip
Technicolor, Becky Sharp, loosely based on William Makepeace
Thackeray's nineteenth-century British novel Vanity Fair.
Following the death of the original director, Rouben Mamoulian
took over the project and brought his flair for stylistic experimen-

tation evident from Applause and other films. In Becky Sharp this
took the form of subtle changes in color patterns based on shifts
in mood and narrative development. Lacking a compelling
screenplay, however, Becky Sharp failed to excite either audiences
or the industry, and
it became a technological footnote rather
than a landmark.
For the next several years color was utilized primarily in
Westerns and other outdoor films where
it was regarded as
enhancing picturesque landscapes. Producer David O. Selznick
(1902-1965), who had worked at Paramount, M-G-M, and RKO
before setting up his own company, Selznick International, was
most committed to the new technology: he used
it on A Star Is
Born and other films he distributed through United Artists, and
then on the grandest production of the era, the nearly four-hour
Civil War epic Gone With the W/nc/ (1939), released by M-G-M,
with Victor Fleming (1883-1949) credited as director. Also in
1939, and also directed by Fleming, M-G-M's The Wizard of Oz
shifts from black-and-white to Technicolor after a tornado carries
Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto from Kansas to the Land
of Oz. Though
it was not yet clear that color was other than an
occasional novelty,
it had helped to create two popular classics.

AN ESTABLISHMENT CINEMA
In the space of half a decade, Hollywood had gone from some-
thing of an outlaw cinema,
in the eyes of some, to something of
an establishment cinema. As the United States struggled to
recover from the Great Depression, as the rise of European
Fascism and the onset of war caused the nation to reconsider
its
history and values, the movies became increasingly important as
framers of cultural and ideological discourses. Two filmmakers
emerged, to industry and public alike, as key figures in
Hollywood's task of cultural definition: Frank Capra and John
Ford. Both directors were concerned
in separate ways— Capra
through social comedy. Ford with historical films and literary
adaptations— with leadership: how leaders emerge in the
American democratic mythology from humble roots, how they
forge complex and reciprocal relations with those they lead.
Between 1934 and 1941
this pair won six of eight Academy
Awards as best director—three apiece.
Both were from immigrant Catholic backgrounds. Capra was
born
in Sicily and immigrated with his family to Los Angeles when
he was six. Ford (1895-1973) was named Sean Aloysius O'Feeney
when he was born in the state of Maine as the thirteenth child of
Irish immigrant parents. Outsiders who became insiders, they
both possessed ambition and the vision, after careers as journey-
men directors, to seize the opportunity the times and the movie
industry's new role afforded.

events in interior space, where the moral relationships of commu-
nities are contested artd formed: a dinner table in Stagecoach, a
courtroom in Vbur^ Mr. Lincoln, a migrant camp tent in The
Grapes of Wrath. Ford's historical pjerspective emerged in these
communal settings, emphasizing, much like Capra. the necessity
of justice and respect for common people.

European Emigres
Hollywood in the 1930s became a place of refuge as well as
opportunity for European filmmakers fleeing from political or reli-
gious persecution. With another influx of Germans added to
those (like Lubitsch and Murnau) who had migrated during the
silent era, the Weimar cinema's legacy was carried forward as
much or more in Hollywood as in Berlin. The leading figure
among post-1933 refugees was Fritz Lang, who left Germany
reputedly after being asked to head the film industry under Nazi
control (see Chapter 10). Lang directed his first American film.
Fury,

wonders. Along with the films already mentioned here
Cone
With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington, Stagecoach, Young SAr. Lincoln, Drums Along the
Mohawk, Ninotchka— another dozen all-time favorites could eas-
ily be named, ranging from genre works like Howard Hawks's
Only Angels Have Wings to prestige literary adaptations such as
Wuthering Heights, directed by William Wyler (1902-1981
). The
year marked a high point in Hollywood's history for cultural
power and self-confidence. Amid the hundreds of genre films
churned out by the studios, the bedrock of the American motion
picture industry's mode of production, an elite of filmmakers had
coalesced with the talent and desire to create serious, ambitious
films.
Still, not all agreed that this was the best of all possible cinema
worlds. Along with self-confidence, some thought, came self-
importance; along with cultural power, a certain grandiosity. A
more pessimistic assessment of the year of wonders saw a decline
in the energy and excitement of genre production (only the West-
ern was showing some renewed signs of lifel and a static,
unadventurous style in the so-called "quality" films.

ORSON WELLES
If there was complacency in Hollywood,
it was challenged by the
arrival (significantly,
in 1939) of theater and radio's bov genius,
twent>'-four-year-old Orson Welles (1915-1985). Welles had
gained prominence at an extraordinarily youthful age as a gifted
theater director and actor with the Federal Theatre Project and
then his own company. Mercury Theatre Group, formed with
John Houseman (1902-19881. Moving Mercur\' Theatre to net-
work radio, he created front-page headlines when his 1938
Halloween eve radio broadcast adapting H. G. Wells's no\'el The
War of the Worlds convinced many listeners that Martians had
invaded New Jersey. RKO offered him nearK' unprecedented cre-
ative freedom—the opportunitv to be simultaneousK producer,

ishing 25 percent share of his films' gross eamings. HolK^vood

The most significant film
produced in the American com-
mercial cinema, by general
critical consensus,
is Orson
Welles's Citizen Kane il94h. Few
of its stylistic effects were new;
what was dazzling was the way it
brought to bear a variety of inno-
vations in nearly every scene. The
narrative was based on a mvstery:
what was the meaning of media
baron Charles Foster Kane's dying
word, "Rosebud"? The film inves-
tigates the question through a
series of flashbacks as Kane's
associates tell their stories to a
journalist. In the memoir of
financier Walter P. Thatcher

Citizen Kane
Behind the scenes, however, Welles was gifted at gathering
around him talented collaborators. Besides the Mercury Theatre
performers he brought with him— including Joseph Gotten
(b. 1905), Agnes Moorehead (1906-1974), and' Everett Sloane
(1909-1965)— he enlisted established professionals for his first
production, Citizen Kane (1941
). These included writer Herman
Mankiewicz (1898-1953); cinematographer Gregg Toland, who
had worked with John Ford on The Crapes of Wrath, among other
films; and art director Van Nest Polglase. He also gave opportuni-
ties to newcomers Robert Wise (b. 1914) as editor and Bernard
Herrmann (1911-1975) as composer. With a working title of
"American," Citizen Kane was no less serious and ambitious than
the works of Ford and Gapra, a biographical mystery story seeking
to unravel the character and cultural significance of a media
baron whose dying word was "Rosebud."
It incurred the wrath of
a living media baron, newspaper publisher William Randolph
Hearst, who felt, not without reason, that Welles's Gharles Foster
Kane was modeled after him.
Recognized as a major work at
its release, despite the contro-
versy generated by Hearst, Citizen Kane has continued to grow in
stature as the American commercial cinema's most important
film.
It enabled the spectator not only to look through the frame
at a make-believe world, but to see once again, so to speak, the
frame as a constructed image: to take delight not only from stories
but from the virtuosity and splendor of cinematic art.
As with D. W. Griffith's early films, no single aspect of Citizen
Kane was entirely original or previously unknown to filmmakers,
but the work's startling impact came from
its total effect, the con-
centration, comprehensiveness, and unity of its stylistic effort.
Where innovation
in Hollywood tended to occur only
in isolated
sequences and shots, Welles strove with his collaborators to uti-
lize multiple innovations in nearly every shot and scene
throughout the entire film.
These began with the basic narrative, fragmenting the story to
different voices and viewpoints, refusing linearity or unity of per-
spective. This was carried forward through mise-en-scene, the
construction of exceptionally deep sets so that action as well as
narrative could fragment into different planes of space and depth.
It was augmented by long camera takes that enabled greater
movement
in performance and ensemble acting by the Mercury
players.
It was all made possible by Gregg Toland's cinematogra-
phy and lighting, using camera lenses that maintained focus
through the deep space of the sets (Toland gave credit to Welles's
unusually detailed preproduction planning, which was required
for building
c amera locations into sets for extraordinary low- and
high-angle shots lo convey symbolic meaning). And finally,
it was
embedded in the shot continuity, which used sound and lighting
changes as editing devices to avoid direct cuts in favor of sc ene
changes through camera panning or dollying, or overlapping
dissolves.
The Magnificent Amhersons
Welles went on to write and direct (and to narrate, though not to
appear in) The Magnificent Amhersons (1942), set in the early-
twentieth-century American Middle West and based on a novel
by Booth Tarkington. Before editing was completed, the United
States entered World War
II, and Welles went to Mexico and
Brazil to begin work on a documentary entitled
"It's All True,"
jointly sponsored by RKO and the U.S. government to strengthen
ties with Latin America. While he was away from Hollywood,
studio executives ordered The Magnificent Amhersons cut by
one-third; at the same time they lost interest in the documentary
and destroyed some of the footage Welles had delivered. Even the
truncated version of The Magnificent Amhersons that survives
marks a considerable achievement, and researchers have begun
to uncover the remarkable and tragic tale of "It's All True," as well
as some of its lost footage.

TEN
EETING
With the advent of sound, no less than
in the silent era, the prime
challenge to the world's film industries was how to respond to
Hollywood's competition. But as the 1930s progressed, the task
took on a stronger patriotic character. As struggles among nations
once again erupted into armed conflict, and regional wars
expanded to engulf the globe, the motion picture medium came
to be valued more than ever as an important tool of national pur-
pose and a shaper of public consciousness. Governments as well
as individuals turned their attention to nonfiction filmmaking to
serve the ends of propaganda and persuasion (as will be dis-
cussed in Chapter 11
), but the documentary mode rarely reached
as wide an audience as narrative fiction films. This popular art
thus became the focus of political intervention to a far greater
extent than
in any previous era. There had been numerous
instances of film being used for propaganda purposes; the World
War
I period and the Soviet cinema were recent examples. In the
1930s, however, utilization of entertainment to communicate
national ideology became widespread.

STATE CONTROL
OVER CINEMA
The decade's principal innovation was the spread of state control
over cinema. Except tor the Soviet Union, where the state sought
to control
all enterprise, and the short time in Germany during
World War
I when goxernment temporarily took over film produc-
tion for propaganda purposes, the medium had belonged over its
first three decades almost entirelv to private enterprise.
Governments, of course, had intervened in cinematic affairs in
myriad ways, such as quotas, tariffs, and censorship, but decision
making in artistic and financial matters had remained in private
hands.
New models of state power over cinema emerged in the 1930s
in two of the historicallv most important filmmaking countries,
Italy and Germany. Both nations had been taken over by dictator-
ial regimes that exercised different forms of totalitarian, sometimes
brutal, control over institutions and people— in
Italy, the Fascists
under Benito Mussolini, from 1922; in Germany, the National
Socialists (Nazis) under Adolf Hitler, from 1933. In the Soviet
Union, meanwhile. Communism was becoming more blatantiv a
direct subsidies, though
it left artistic control
in private hands.
Production gradually rose, reaching eighty or more films per year
by decade's end.
For years after the Fascist regime collapsed
in World War
II,
critics and historians ignored the films made during its rule. The
works were dismissed either as crude propaganda or as frivolous,
escapist pseudo-Hollywood works featuring lives of the rich in
lavish settings (these latter were called tclefuni bianchi films
because their sets were furnished with white telephones, signifiers
of conspicuous wealth). But a reevaluation of that era's films has
begun, and
it finds a more complex cinematic achievement. Of
all the totalitarian governments. Fascist Italy proved most tolerant
of diversity, at least in the arts. A case in point was the Cenfro
Sperimentale, where, as Italian film historian Gian Piero Brunetta
has written, antifascists were able to study and work. The
regime's interest in Soviet aesthetics enabled Marxist critic
Umberto Barbaro to teach Russian film theories at the school and
espouse a realist aesthetic; among those who studied at the
school during the Fascist period were filmmakers who emerged as
leading figures after World War
II, including Michelangelo
Antonioni, Giuseppe De Santis, Pietro Germi, and Luigi Zampa
(see Chapter 13).
HOLLYWOOD'S
CHALLENGE
totalitarian dictatorship under Joseph Stalin. For all three regimes,
a central purpose was to build film industries that would produce
fiction films to serve state policies.
Italy
The Italian Fascist government took nearly a decade to develop
its
plans for cinema. Throughout the 1920s
it concentrated
its film
activities on newsreel production, while commercial feature film-
making fell into disarray (see Chapter 6). When the state turned
its
attention to the problem in the early 1930s,
it found two strong
models to draw upon— Hollywood and the Soviet Union.
Hollywood's capitalist free enterprise mode of production showed
the ability to make successful popular entertainment efficiently
and
in quantity; the Soviet socialist mode demonstrated the possi-
bility of gaining wide prestige by making films combining art,
ideology, and spectacle. Italy sought to adopt elements of both
systems.
It wanted to encourage films that merged Hollywood and
Soviet styles, communicating ideology and political viewpoints in
the form of popular entertainment.
The Soviet model
fell into place first with the establishment in
1935 of the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, a
school to train filmmakers as well as develop film criticism and
theory. The Hollywood model followed in 1938 with the opening
of Cinecitta, a studio complex on the outskirts of Rome designed
to concentrate and organize the film production process. The
government also supported filmmaking through quota laws and
ALESSANDRO BLASETTi. An effective synthesis of ideology
and popular style was achieved during the Fascist era in the films
of Alessandro Blasetti (1900-1987), a neglected figure in film
history. Beginning with So/e ("Sun," 1929), Blasetti directed a
number of the period's important films; his career continued
through the 1960s. In Terra mac/re ("Mother Earth," 1930) and
1860 (1934), two of his major works, evocative images of the rural
countryside, photographed with lengthy panning camera move-
ments, supported the ideological theme that the land and the
peasantry were foundations for national values. Terra madre con-
cerns an aristocrat who neglects his country estates to live as a
city playboy; an unscrupulous manager plots to steal the land
while the peasants who farm
it are demoralized and indifferent.
Awakened to his responsibility through the love of a country
woman, the aristocrat returns, defeats the villain, and vows to ful-
fill his traditional role, rooted in the land. 1860 is a historical film
about the era when Italy was united as a single nation;
its story of
Giuseppe Garibaldi's campaign to liberate Sicily from foreign rule
focuses less on the hero than on efforts of rural people to achieve
their place in the new nation.
Germany
The situation
in Germany when the Nazis gained power in
January 1933 was different from that of Italy. Though hard hit by
world depression and domestic political turmoil, the German film
industry remained a major force in international cinema, pro-

Fritz Lang returned
to the archcriminal of his 1922
film. Dr. Mabuse der Spieler, for a
sequel he later described as a
parable on Nazi "terror meth-
ods, " Das Testament des Dr.
Mabuse (The Last Will of Dr.
Mabuse, 1933); the Nazis banned
the film on the grounds that it
might encourage terrorism against

ducing over one hundred films yearly and earning a third of its
income from other countries. Hitler's regime was determined to
take over this industry, as well as every other aspect of culture
and society, and utilize cinema
in spreading
its ideology and
strengthening its grip on the country. Within
its first weeks the
Nazi government set up a Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and
Propaganda under Joseph Coebbels. Speaking to film industry
leaders, Coebbels proposed to "radically reform German films"
and praised Eisenstein's Soviet work The Battleship Potemkin for
propagating "even the worst kind of ideas
.
.
. through the
medium of an outstanding work of art."'
A day after his speech, Coebbels banned Fritz Lang's Das
Testament des Or. Mabuse {The Last Will of Dr. Mabuse, 1933).
The official reason given was that
it endangered "public order
and security"; press accounts suggested that the criminal activities
of the demonic Mabuse could encourage terrorist acts against the
state. In later years Lang gave an equally cogent explanation, that
the film "meant to show Hitler's terror methods as a parable."' In
one scene (to which either Coebbels or Lang could have referred)
a demented scientist, possessed by Mabuse's spirit, looks directly
toward the camera and hails the criminal as an
" Obermensch"
(superman) seeking to destroy and rule by terror. Lang claimed
that, after banning the film, Coebbels offered him leadership of
the Cerman film industr\'; though often cited in film histories, this
seems wholly mythical. The Nazis took over the film industr\' by
their practice of Gleichschaltung (coordination), the term used to
describe the placing of cultural and industrial sectors under state
domination.
Lang chose exile, as did many other film workers who opp>osed
Hitler's authoritarianism or feared his anti-Semitic threats. Emigres
included Robert Wiene, director of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari;
screenwriter (later director) Billy Wilder and actors Conrad Veldt
from Dr. Caligari and Peter Lorre from M. Wiene settled in
France, but Wilder, Veidt, and Lorre were among scores of
Cerman film personnel who went on to forge important careers in
Hollywood. (Not all succeeded. C. W. Pabst, director of

Soviet Union
The situation in the Soviet Union differed considerably from that
of Italy or Germanv. As those countries tried to expand their role
in international film culture and displav their ideologies to the
worid, Soviet cinema turned inward; where Italy and Germany
found models in the classic 1920s Soviet silent films, the U.S.S.R.
repudiated those films and criticized their makers. The historv of
1930s Sov iet filmmaking— long hidden through suppression or
distorted bv state-approved versions— is emerging like a forgotten
nightmare.
Soviet cinema went through a fundamental transformation
between 1928 and 1935. Factors such as the political evolution of
the Soviet state, bureaucratic and personal rivalries, and Stalin's
iiKreasinglv cruel and capricious dictatorship all contributed to
rejection of the prev ious decade's achievements as formalism and
a demand for "socialist realism" in cinema isee Chapter 7). In
practice, "realism" often meant a simplified visual style where
both heroes and villains were bigger than
life. Socialist realism's

triumph was signaled in 1936 when Eisenstein's Bezhin lug
Bezhin Meadows was banned and attacked bv Boris Shumvatskv,
head of the Soviet film industrv, as "anti-artistic and politically
quite unsound."' During 1935-36 some thirtv -seven films, fully
one-third of total production, were banned after completion and
held back from release.
The goal of this repression was not only ideological correctness
but also the creation of a popular entertainment cinema, espe-
cially after the imfxxting of foreign films was halted. As in
HollyvvtxxJ, genre films dominated Soviet production; though
many of these were fictional dramas set in the 1917-20 era of rev-
olution and civil W3r (with actors portrav ing Lenin and Stalin as
humble leaders of the peoples there were also musical comedies.

FILMMAKING
OUTSIDE EUROPE
Outside Europe, United States domination in film was maintained
or even grew with the coming of sound (Japan, as noted below,
was a singular exception i. Small and struggling film industries
were burdened not only w ith the costs of acquiring sound equip-
ment and wiring theaters but also in some cases (as in India and
China
I with the problem of multiple languages within national
borders. Delays in converting to sound marked further setbacks
for filmmakers seeking to compete with United States and
European films in their own markets. Even more than the silent
period, the first decade after sound outside Europe and
Hollywood
is a forgotten era of cinema history. Surviving films are
little know n even in their countries of origin, where thev could
serve as a significant cultural legacy. Circulation of such works in
video format in the coming years may make more films part of a
worldwide cinema historv.
What
is important
is that, despite such odds, filmmaking per-
sisted. In some cases
it was lone individuals who struggled, in
others
it was businessmen w ith purelv commercial motives. Many
countries were able to produce onK a handful of films annuallv;
others got up to about a dozen. Mexico, with govemment support
for its film industry and a quota svstem for its theaters, was mak-
ing more than fif^ films a vear bv the late 1930s. B\ 1940 India
had attained third position behind Japan and the United States,
with 171
films released that vear, manv of them song-and-dance
melodramas that drew on Indian popular culture and could
appeal to many different language groups in Indian society.
Japan
No film industry was more capable of responding to Hollvwood's
challenge than the Japanese. Japan rivaled HollvAvood in volume
of film production— each country averaged around five hundred
features a vear during the 1930s—and in industrial organization,
with a powerful privatelv owned, vertically integrated studio sys-
tem. In
its home market the Japanese cinema was as dominant as
Hollvwood was in the United States, partiallv for the same rea-
sons: studios that owned theaters showed their own films in
preference to foreign competition. Domestic films claimed three-
fourths of the box office at the beginning of the 1930s, and their
share kept rising in an era of nationalistic fervor. Where Japanese
films could not match Hollvwood was in world influence, since
few were screened outside the country's island borders.
Sweeping claims have been made for Japanese cinema of the
1930s, in which this cultural isolation plays a part. In a study of
Japanese film published in 1979, theorist Noel Burch argued that
Japan "has produced a cinema which
is in essence unlike that of
any other nation. "" Few film scholars accept this viewpoint.
It
ignores Japan's broad interest in United States and European
films, technologies, and cinematic practices, as well as positing
an overly rigid and monolithic notion of a "Westem" mode of
representation. What remains of greatest value from this endeavor
is
its focus on the outstanding achievements of 1930s Japanese
filmmaking, which deserves to be much more widely known.
One certain way that Japanese filmmaking of the 1930s differed
from HolK"vvood's lav in the status of directors. In contrast to the
HolK-vvood studio practice of placing control in producers' hands,
Japanese directors maintained their artistic autonomy and creative
independence. Like their counterparts in the United States, such
as John Ford and Howard Hawks, Japan's leading directors of this
era got their start in silent films, created some of the classics of
the 1930s, and went on to make important films for nearlv half a
century. Most prominent among these figures were Kenji
Mizoguchi (1898-1956) and Yasujiro Ozu (1903-1963).
KE\ji MIZOGUCHI.
Mizoguchi directed more than forty
films before 1930; of these, only one survives, and this in an
incomplete version. His films of the 1930s frequentlv centered on
social injustices suffered bv women. The first to place this theme
in a contemporary setting was Saniwa ereji iNaniwa Elegy, but
more generallv known in English as Osaka Eleg\, 1936i. His mise-
en-scene of modern offices and fashionablv fumished apartments
is as dark and starklv shadowed as the film noir interiors of post-

soundtrack are ironic counterpoints to the oppression suffered bv

China
Among the many neglected histories of film production before
World War
II, one that has begun to attract international scholarly
attention
is China's. This interest stems in part from efforts to
understand the background to the emergence of an important film
movement in China in the 1980s (see Chapter 24). But
it has been
sustained by discoveries of a significant effort in the 1930s to
make films with strong social purpose. Responding to the
Japanese invasion of northeast China in 1931 and a Japanese
bombing raid on the city of Shanghai
in 1932, progressive
Chinese filmmakers, some associated with the Communist party,
began to make films exposing social problems and promoting
national unity and defense.
Two exemplary works, both made in 1934, were Shen nu {The
Goddess) and Da Lu (The Big Road). The first was a silent film,
the other had sound effects and music, along with dialogue inter-
titles. Starring China's leading film actress, Ruan Lingyo
(1910-1935), The Goddess was the first directorial effort of Wu

In
its early development Mexican cinema
was strongly influenced by films made in
Italy, and the histories of the two film
industries follow somewhat similar pat-
terns: a period of strength around World
War
I, a nadir during the 1920s, and a
revival during the 1930s with state
support.
Bordering the United States, Mexico
was as vulnerable as any country to dom-
ination by American films, but
it also
made
its contribution to American cin-
ema when performers with few
opportunities at home pursued careers
north of the border. These included
Antonio Moreno (1886-1967), a
Hollywood leading man of the 1920s
who was cast as Greta Carbo's lover in
her second American film. The Temptress
(1926); Dolores del Rio (1905-1983),
who played important roles in Hollywood
and Mexican films for more than forty
years; and Lupe Velez (1909-1944), who
was typed as the "Mexican Spitfire" in a
B-picture series of the early 1940s.
With the coming of sound, Hollywood
studios experimented with Spanish-
language production, but these films
foundered,
in part because Latin
American audiences would not accept
the medley of regional accents the
performers offered. The possibility
of reaching an international Spanish-
language market gave new energy to
Mexican filmmaking. Antonio Moreno
returned from Hollywood to direct the
first Mexican sound film, Santa (1932).
The next year more than twenty sound
features were produced at two studios,
with budgets, according to Carl
J. Mora, a
historian of Mexican cinema, averaging
from $5,700 to $8,500 (the cheapest
Hollywood studio films of this period
cost about $150,000 to produce).
In 1934 a new political administration
in Mexico gave financial support to a
production company, CLASA
(Cinematografica Latino Americana, S.A.),
to build a modern studio, but
it did not
fully put in place a state cinema on the
model of Italy, Germany, or the Soviet
Union. Observers at the time noted that
the Mexican cinema's greatest problem
was that private investment looked to
filmmaking for quick profits rather than to
build an industry. Spain soon surpassed
Mexico as the dominant producer of
Spanish-language films.

El compadre Mendoza
(1933), directed by Fernando de
Fuentes (1894-1958),
is regarded
as a classic of early Mexican
sound cinema. Much of the film 's
significance derived from its set-
ting during the 1913-15 struggles
of the Mexican revolution.
Through a narrative of a
landowner's unsuccessful
attempts to balance his relations
with competing forces,
it portrays
the betrayal of revolutionary
ideals.

aborted filmmaking project in
Mexico for a visual style convey-

By the end of the 1930s India, though a
colony of Britain until after World War
II,
becanne the third-largest film-producing
country, behind the United States and
Japan, and laid the groundwork for later
decades when
it moved to the forefront
as the perennial leader in total film
releases. How did this come about, espe-
cially since up until the late 1920s, as in
many other lands, Indian theaters played
mostly Hollywood films?
A primary reason
is that the coming of
sound, rather than causing a crisis or
entrenching United States domination,
created new opportunities. India was a
country of at least fifteen major languages
and many more dialects, and each lan-
guage group was eager to see films with
its own spoken dialogue. "Hear your
Gods and Goddesses talk in your own
language" was a slogan adopted by
regional film producers. Filmmakers also
found, however, that traditional music
which occurred
in two principal forms
widely shared among disparate language
groups— could reach audiences across
narrow linguistic barriers.
Indian sound cinema quickly became
dominated by musical films. Indra Sabha
(1932), for example, contained some sev-
enty songs. Performers had to sing as well
as act, and newcomers with appealing
voices became not only stars but instant
celebrities. Film music
in recordings and
played on radio attained an importance
in Indian popular culture beyond that of
the films themselves. Indian film music,
however, was different from the musical
scores composed for films in the United
States or Europe:
it put emphasis on lyrics
as a continuation of spoken dialogue,
with words in song carrying the narrative.
Below:
10. 15.
Indian film studios
sought to adopt the Hollywood
mode of production, employing
hundreds of creative and craft
workers on a permanent basis.
One of the first firms utilizing this
model was the Prabhat Film
Company, organized in 1929 in
Kolhapur and located in Poona
after 1933. Among its founders
was the director Rajaram
Vanakudre Shantaram, who went
by the professional name
V.
Shantaram (b.
1901). He began
making sound films in 1932, and
his seventh sound feature, Amar
)yoti CEtemal Light,
1936), was
selected for screening at the
fourth Venice film festival in Italy.
A spectacle film set in a mytho-
logical past,
it concerns a woman
who is mistreated by her hus-
band, but whose protests result in
her son being taken from her. She
forms a group of similarly
ill-
treated women who enlist a band
of pirates to fight for their side.
Ultimately she is united with her
son and gives up her power to
him and his bride.

Another important pro-
duction unit. New Theatres Ltd.,
was organized in Calcutta in
1930. One of the filmmakers who
joined it was an independent pro-
ducer, Pramathesh Chandra
Barua (1903-1951), son of a
rajah, who wrote, directed, and
occasionally performed in his
own films. Barua's films dealt with
contemporary social themes and
often featured a doomed hero (or
heroine). One such figure was
portrayed by Pahari Sanyal in
Barua's Maya (Illusion,

Yonggang (1907-1983). Though linked to the "fallen woman"
genre of Hollywood and European cinema, The Goddess was less
a genre picture than a work committed to a presentation of social
conditions. A prostitute, working to support her child's education,
murders a gambler who stole her money. Imprisoned, she
is con-
soled that others have recognized her motives and will aid her
child's future.
The Big Road was written and directed by Sun Yu (1900-1990),
who had attended the University of Wisconsin and studied film at
Columbia University in New York.
It concerns a gang of road
workers who struggle against a collaborationist landlord and "the
enemy," clearly the Japanese. Without spoken dialogue, the film's
experimental soundtrack
is marked by songs and percussion
sounds when the workers touch each other in playful gestures. At
the end, an "enemy" airplane strafes the road and kills several
workers, but their spirits rise from the dead (in superimposition)
to help the survivors continue building the road.
BRITAIN
One national cinema that seemed
in a position to gain from the
coming of sound was Britain's. The British possessed a literary tra-
dition and an imperial history that have served as sources for films
made in many countries over nearly a century. They had superbly
trained stage performers who spoke the English language with an
elegance and clarity few Americans could match. But well-
entrenched industrial patterns made
it difficult for significant
changes to occur. Hollywood motion picture companies domi-
nated British film distribution and about three-quarters of the films
that played in Britain were made in the United States. British
actors were much
in demand across the Atlantic, and many prac-
ticed their precise diction on Hollywood sound stages.
The strongest catalyst for change in British cinema was a 1927
law setting up a quota— a minimum percentage of British films
theaters were required to show. The quota started at 7.5 percent
and rose annually to around 20 percent after a decade. The
Cinematograph Films Act, as
it was called, had an immediate
impact on British production. The percentage of British films
shown in theaters jumped immediately from under 5 percent to
over 12 percent, and climbed to nearly 30 percent by 1936, a
year when total British production surpassed two hundred films.
But what kind of films^ The quota law defined a qualifying film
as anything over three thousand feet in length— just over thirty
minutes. The Hollywood-owned distributors found they could ful-
fill the requirements by financing cheap films of minimal length
and quality, known as "quota quickies," that theaters rented but
played only at off hours, or not at all.
In quantitative terms Britain
had the third-largest volume of films produced during the 1930s,
but a considerable share were films hardly meant to be screened.
Their principal virtue was the experience they provided aspiring
filmmakers. An example
is Michael Powell (1905-1990), a major
British director of the World War
II and postwar periods, who got
his start directing forty-minute quickies in the early 1930s. Powell,
who later formed a partnership with screenwriter Emeric
Pressburger (1902-1988),
is known for works such as The Red
Shoes (1948) and Peeping Tom (1960).
In the 1930s British films were thus, like the products of most
other national cinemas, primarily for domestic consumption.
Particularly successful in regional and small-town theaters were
popular comedies featuring music hall stars.
Still, British filmmak-
ing in
its smaller way was quite as cosmopolitan as Hollywood,

with strong ties especially to Central Europe. International copro-
ductions with German companies were not uncommon in the
late silent and early sound period. The filmmaker who success-
fully developed the cinematic potential of Britain's heritage and
imperial history, Alexander Korda (1893-1956), came from this
international milieu.
Alexander Korda
Korda, a Hungarian-born producer-director, had worked
in
Budapest, Vienna, Berlin, Hollywood for four years, and Paris
before arriving in London
in 1931 with a contract from British
Paramount. He laid his foundation with quota quickies, but his
desire was to crack the Hollywood market, not as the studio
employee he had been, but on his own terms. Starting his own
company, London Films, and backed by a distribution deal with
United Artists, he scored the first big international success for a
British picture with The Private Life of Henry W// (1933).
It was
the first British film nominated for an American Academy Award,
and
its star, Charles Laughton, won the Oscar as best actor.
The Private Life of Henry VIII was perhaps British history as
only a non-Britisher could imagine
it: half historical pageant, half
comic farce. Though
listed as director, Korda by this time was
most heavily involved as a producer, and the picture's "author-
ship" belongs as much to Laughton, who plays the "bluebeard"
monarch with six wives as a likable lout, and
its designer,
Alexander's brother Vincent Korda. Korda's success enabled him
to become a partner in United Artists in 1935, and he produced
more than twenty films for the company over the next five years,
many in the historical and imperial genres he helped to launch.
Alfred Hitchcock
The most important British filmmaker of the 1930s was Alfred
Hitchcock (1899-1980). His early experience as a director of
British-German coproductions (see Chapter 6) led him toward an
expressionist mise-en-scene in his first sound films, but he gradu-
ally abandoned visual— and aural— symbolism for an emphasis
on editing as a means of involving the spectator.
"The screen ought to speak
its own language, freshly coined,"
Hitchcock wrote in 1938, "and
it can't do that unless
it treats an
acted scene as a piece of raw material which must be broken up,
taken to bits, before
it can be woven into an expressive visual pat-
tern.
.
.
. You gradually build up the psychological situation, piece
by piece, using the camera to emphasize first one detail, then
another. The point
is to draw the audience right inside the situa-
tion instead of leaving them to watch
it outside, from a distance."'
Hitchcock's style began distinctively to emerge in The Man
Who Knew Too Much (1934) and The 39 Steps (1935), made for
Gaumont British, one of Britain's "major" studios. Both works
dealt with espionage and international intrigue, subjects not yet
part of Hollywood's genre repertory, which gave them a quality of
freshness they
still retain. Hitchcock utilized classically edited
scene breakdowns to place spectators in a multiple field of com-
mitments to the narrative— as moviegoers, as vicarious members
of audiences within the film, and as potential participants. The

Albert Hall concert sequence of The Man Who Knew Too Much

acter screams, disrupting the concert and foiling an assassination.

lies in
Hitchcock's capacity to unite his style and themes of spectator-
ship and performance. The opening sequence
is exemplary: four
quick shots convey the spectator into a seat

and the line between performer and audience
is blurred; finally,
out of this welter, emerges a man who makes himself visible by

premise of this first sequence. Falsely accused of murder, Hannay

FRANCE
As
it turned out, the strongest response to HolK'wood's challenge
during the 1930s came from France. In one sense, France's lead-
ing role uas obvious;
in another, paradoxically, surprising. The
obvious reasons begin with French film culture—broader, more
\ igorous, more eclectic than anvAvhere else. The French came to
terms more readiK than other national film cultures with the
medium's dual possibilities as popular entertainment and high
art. The\
linked their commercial industr\ more closelv w ith
experimental and avant-garde filmmaking. Thev managed to
admire HolK\%ood's achievement w ithout undue resentment,
w hile also supporting domestic productions. Their capacity for
innovation in both film theorv and practice was spurred bv the
coming of sound.
The surprising part
is that France's film industrv was weak at
the beginning of the decade and ripe for domination. Unable to
finance the transition to sound, the industrv was invaded from
German\ b\ Tobis-Klangfilm and from Holl\A\ood by Paramount.
Each set up studios near Paris to produce films in French and
other languages. For Tobis. Rene Clair, director of the Surrealist
classics Paris qui dort and Entr'acte, made a series of earK sound
features, including Sous les toits de Paris [Under the Root's of
Paris, 19301, Le Million [The Million. 1931
1, and A Nous la liberte
(C/Ve Ls Liljertv, T^Jl
i. At
its Jomviiie studio in France Paramount
made an astonishing one hundred features in a year (many were
multiple productions of the same narrative in different languages).
But economic setbacks caused bv the depression forced
Paramount to abandon
its French effort, ant! Tobis soon after
retreated to Germany with the Nazi takeover of the German film
industry. French filmmaking went back into the hands of the
French.
Film production in France was structured differently than in any
of the other major film-producing countries. After the departure of
Paramount and Tobis, no major studios dominated the scene.
Quot<i regulations were abandoned in the early 1930s, under
considerable American pressure, and the government intervened
little in film production ^except for censorship of completed films).
What emerged was an industry of small producers, able to raise
financing for over one hundred new releases annually through the
1930s.
If state control over cinema was a dominant trend of the
decade, as in Italy and Germam, France went strongly against
the grain, to a svstem of individual filmmakers operating
independently.
Poetic Realism
If French cinema lacked a dominant trend provided by govern-
ment direction or studio methods, however, shared social and
235

aesthetic concerns produced a distinctive style of French filmmak-
ing in the 1930s. This was called poetic realism— a broad term
with many meanings, yet with an overall clarity of purpose.
It
implied first of all fidelity to milieu: to the settings of everyday
life,
usually of working people and lower classes, rather than the lav-
ish fantasy worlds that Hollywood created and the fascist cinemas
of Germany and Italy emulated. Within these authentic atmos-
pheres, characters were driven by destinies larger than
themselves, by implacable fate. This could be understood through
political ideology, or as a form of social determinism. Yet the
"poetic" aspect of this realism was attained not only through the
aesthetic evocation of social ambiance, but also by the charac-
ters' struggles to transcend fate and achieve important life goals.
JEAN
VI CO. One of the most compelling visions of poetic
realism was created by Jean Vigo (1905-1934)
in a brief, tragic
career that included only a single feature-length fiction film. The
son of an anarchist who was murdered in prison during Wodd
War
I, Vigo embodied
in his work the anarchist ideal of forging
unity through the collaboration of free individuals. On his four
films— two short documentaries, the short fiction film Zero de
condulte (Zero for Conduct, 1933), and /.'Afa/anfe (1934)— he
worked with cinematographer Boris Kaufman (1906-1980), a
younger brother of Soviet documentarian Dziga Vertov. Kaufman
later went to Hollywood and won an Academy Award for cine-
matography on On the Waterfront {]954). For his two fiction films
Vigo utilized composer Maurice Jaubert (1900-1940), who went
on to write some three dozen additional scores for French films in
the 1930s. Shaping his film music to the narrative and stylistic
needs of specific films, Jaubert contributed significantly to the
movement of poetic realism. He was killed in action just before
France surrendered to Germany in World War
II.

life. The film's sentimentality
is leavened by
Simon's raucous performance and sometimes leering humor (as in
the scene where the woman explores his cabin and he shows her
his tattoos), as well as by the ambient songs and accordion music
contributed by Jaubert. Circulated for years in cut versions, a
restored L'Atalante was released in 1990 to new acclaim as a
remarkable achievement in cinema history.
MARCEL PACNOL. A different form of realism shaped the
films of Marcel Pagnol (1895-1974); heavy on dialogue, they
seemed stage-bound, but they also languidly explored the every-
day social world. Pagnol was a successful playwright who shifted
to cinema with the coming of sound. Paramount acquired several
of his stage works concerning
life in the southern port city
Marseilles; he wrote the screenplay for one, Marius (1931 ),
directed by Alexander Korda, and produced another, Fanny
(1932), directed by Marc Allegret (1900-1973). But Pagnol
wanted greater artistic control, and
in 1933 he set up his own stu-
dio in Marseilles, where he began also to direct. This venture
marked Pagnol's commitment to regional cinema at a time when
production was being centralized
in film's "capitals": Hollywood,
Tokyo, London, Berlin, Rome. His leisurely, low-key family melo-
dramas may owe as much to this regional flavor as to his
theatrical aesthetics. He directed Cesar (1936), which carried for-
ward the characters of Marius and Fanny; the three works by three
different directors, but united by Pagnol's common narrative, are

Zero de conduite
is less a work of poetic realism than an
anthem for students. With strong ties to 1920s Surrealist films,
it
depicts a boys' boarding school as a world mingling the comic
and grotesque.
It climaxes in a spontaneous dormitory uprising,
where the boys stage a pillow fight shouting,
"It's war! Down with
school! Down with teachers!" The scene ends with a procession
filmed
in slow motion with floating pillow feathers filling the
screen like snowflakes. The next morning the rebels take to the
roof, raise a skull-and-crossbones flag, and bombard the school's
alumni day activities with a shower of tin cans. The censors saw
the film's spirit of revolt as a threat to public order, and
it was
banned in France until 1945.
Made during the director's final illness, L'Atalante
is a work of
overwhelming lyricism and poignancy. The skipper of a river
barge (the barge's name gives the film
its title) marries a provincial
bourgeois woman. Their
life aboard ship
is alternatively idyllic
and troubled, complicated by an irascible, curmudgeonly first
mate, portrayed by one of the stars of 1930s French cinema, actor
Michel Simon (1895-1975). When they dock on the Seine near
Paris, the woman, yearning for the city's lively pleasures, leaves
the boat; miffed, her husband pulls up anchor and leaves without
her. Apart, each
is lonely and miserable. Seeking to reunite the
couple, the first mate hunts for her, and finds her listening to a
known as the "Marseilles trilogy." Though often neglected in film
history, Pagnol's legacy was refreshed in the 1980s when his writ-
ings and films served as sources for director Claude Berri's Jean de
Florette and Manon des sources {Manon of the Spring; both
1986).
MARCEL CARNE. The most characteristic embodiment of
poetic realism, for many critics, came in the films of Marcel Carne
(b. 1909), though the filmmaker's directing career began late in
the 1930s. Three important films in
little more than a year
Le
Quai des brumes (Port of Shadows, 1938), Hotel du nord (1938),
and Lejour se leve {Daybreak, 1939)— seemed to move beyond
the realm of art or entertainment into national symbolism. The
working-class hero of Le lour se leve, portrayed by popular star
Jean Cabin (1904-1976),
is significantly named Franqois— as a
woman he loves
is named Franqoise. Tormented by a diabolical
237

sadist, Frangois, strong and honest but also innocent and passive,
impulsively shoots his antagonist. The film starts with the shoot-
ing and tells
its story in flashback, leading up to police besieging
his room and Frangois's suicide. Though inevitably analyzed as a
metaphor for France's condition on war's eve, the film holds even
greater interest in
its articulation of poetic realism through charac-
ters' feelings and the dynamics of human relations. Came
collaborated closely on this and all but one other of his prewar
films with screenwriter Jacques Prevert (1900-1977). Maurice
Jaubert also composed the scores of all but one; for Le jour se
leve his music was more quiet and atmospheric than what he had
written for Vigo.
Jean Renoir
All labels, poetic realism included, explode before the breadth
and variety of Jean Renoir's cinematic achievement of the 1930s.
It was Renoir (1894-1979) who,
in the face of Paramount and
Tobis incursions, maintained French independent production in
the eady sound period with such films as La Chienne (The Bitch,
1931
) and Boudu sauve des eaux (Boudu Saved from Drowning,
1932); who led the way toward socially committed cinema in the
mid-1930s with Le Crime de M. LangeiThe Crime ot'M. Lange,
1935), the political campaign film La Vie est a nous {Life Is Ours,
also known as People of France, 1936), and Les Bas-fonds (The
Lower Depths, 1936); who raised the issues of war and history in

(1938). He made so many superior films during the decade that
it
is almost impossible to give each
its due, and topped all the rest
with one of the great works of cinema history, La Regie du jeu
{Rules of the Came, 1939). Yet this last prewar work was booed by
French audiences, cut first by the production company and then
by Renoir in an effort to create a less offending version, and
banned as demoralizing by the French government after the out-
break of war.
The two Renoir works that have attained the firmest status as
film classics are Grand Illusion and Rules of the Came. Both mark
the most striking departure in film technique since the Soviet
experiments with montage in the 1920s. Renoir's stylistic reper-
tory included deep space in the frame, also known as deep focus
or depth of field; a constantly moving camera, utilizing rack
focus, or change of focus in a shot; long takes; and dissonant or
contrapuntal use of the sound- and visual tracks. Into the complex
mise-en-scene that this camera style made possible Renoir poured
as rich and varied an array of characters as can be found in
cinema.
The French critic Andre Bazin (1918-1958), writing in the
1950s, distinguished Renoir's style by naming
it "realism" as
opposed to montage, but this simply underlines how slippery and
vague— how variable— notions of film realism usually are. What
Bazin stressed was a style that emphasized "unity of image in
space and time," as opposed to one (such as Alfred Hitchcock
expounded) that breaks down an image into bits and then recon-
structs
it.*^' Bazin found elements of this "realist" style in several
filmmakers, including Hollywood directors William Wyler and
Orson Welles, and indeed isolated aspects appear in man\' films.
But no other director created, as Renoir did, a style so distinctive
and thorough as to become,
in the sum of its parts, virtually the
antithesis of Hollywood's norms.
The narrative of Crand Illusion takes place during World War
I
among French prisoners of war held by the Germans;
it suggests
the core of common humanity shared by ordinar\' people in the
midst of national antagonisms. Yet along with the universality of
this antiwar theme, Crand Illusion also explores boundaries of
nationality and social class.
Its power rests in considerable part
on
its performances, an intertextual feast beginning with
American director Erich von Stroheim in the role of the German
officer von Rauffenstein, and including Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnav
(from Cesar], and even Jean Daste and Dita Parlo, the barge skip-
per and his wife from L'Atalante.
In Rules of the Came Renoir maintained the theme of social
boundaries but avoided using stars and cast himself as Octave,
the mediator between the film's worlds of aristocrats and servants.
its principal setting
is the country estate of the Marquis de la
Chesnaye, where multiple desires play out amid multiple misun-
derstandings on several social levels.
If many films repay several
viewings, the visual complexity of Rules of the Came demands
them, to unveil the film's plural planes of action and feelings in
its
mobile mise-en-scene.
"It
is a war film, and yet there
is no refer-
240

ence to the war," Renoir wrote in his autobiography. "Beneath
its
seemingly innocuous appearance the story attacks the very struc-
ture of our society."
Few spectators saw the film as innocuous, and many recog-
nized
its attack on the structure of society. For some,
it was
enough that he had cast a Jewish actor. Marcel Dalio, and an
Austrian emigre, Nora Gregor,
in the roles of a French marquis
and marquise. For others,
it was the blend of farce and tragedy,
reminiscent of Le Mariage de Figaro, the eighteenth-century
drama by Pierre Beaumarchais in which the play of desire and
misunderstanding across social classes had signaled the exhaus-
tion of an earlier French social structure. Rules of the Came
demonstrated the capacity of individual filmmakers, operating
independently, to shape social meaning with even greater power
than the propaganda works of state cinemas, and the furious reac-
tion to the film and
its subsequent banning indicated the limits of
tolerance for such independence in the crisis of impending war.
Not until 1959 was there a restored version of the film that closely
approximated Renoir's original intentions, before cuts were made
even prior to
its original release.
It was, significantly, on the eve of
the emergence of the French New Wave (see Chapter 17) that the
film's challenge to Hollywood's dominant stylistics began fully to
be recognized.

ELEVEN
OCUMENTARY,
AND
The 1930s marked a revival of documentary, or nonfiction, film-
making. For many filmmakers,
it was an era of social and political
upheaval that cried out for recording as moving images. For gov-
ernments (as noted
in Chapter 10),
it was a moment to utilize the
possibilities of film for propaganda and persuasion. Some part of
this renewed interest derived from the advent of sound: actuality
footage could be enhanced and dramatized with booming
orchestrations and portentous narrations, which critics in later
years would call "the voice of God."
Since the earliest years, when fiction supplanted actualities as
cinema grew toward mass entertainment, documentaries had
played only a minor role in public consciousness of the medium.
Before the coming of sound, no more than a handful of nonfiction
films had gained commercial distribution
in Europe and the
United States. The number of important filmmakers whose work
was identified with documentary was equally small: Robert
Flaherty, the director of Nanook of the North and Mojna, the
most prominent among a few explorers and adventurers who took
their cameras to "exotic" corners of the world; and in the Soviet
Union,
Esfir Shub and Dziga Vertov, the intractable advocate of
the primacy of documentary over fiction. But at the end of the
1920s Flaherty was fighting a losing battle to maintain a foothold
in the American film industry, and Vertov was facing increasing
hostility from a Soviet film bureaucracy decisively committed to
fiction.
Prior to 1930, nonfiction filmmaking was increasingly regarded
as a branch of the emerging avant-garde film movement, rather
than as a genre on
its own or as an important contributor to the
documentation of social actuality. A strong interest of the avant-
garde was to capture the rhythms and contrasts of the modern
city, and the documentary impulse went into a small group of
films that have come to be labeled city symphonies after what
was perhaps the most ambitious of them, Berlin: Die Sinfonie der
Grossstadt (Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, ^927).
THE CITY SYMPHONY
Berlin: Symphony of a Great City involved Carl Mayer,
scriptwriter of Dr Caligari, and Karl Freund, cinematographer on
The Last Laugh and Metropolis, but ultimately
it was the work of
Walther Ruttmann (1887-1941
), who edited the film and was
credited as director. Ruttmann's background was as an abstract
painter and maker of abstract short films, and his interest
in visu-
alizing the modern city was to shape abstract patterns from
its
242

Walther Rultmann's Berlin:
Die Sinfonie der Grossstadt
(Berlin: Symphony of a Great
City,
19271 sought to capture the
kaleidoscopic movement oi urban
lite and gave its name to a group
of films called "city symphonies.
daily activities. The film traces a day in the city's
life, from early
morning, when trains carrying commuters speed toward
its cen-
ter, to nightlife after dark.
It refuses a viewpoint on the experience
it observes, except for
its delight in the movement and juxtaposi-
tion, through editing, of images as abstract forms.
A verv different version of the city symphony was the first )ean
Vigo-Boris Kaufman collaboration, A Propos de Nice {On the
Subject of Nice, 1930). The film
is strongly in the Surrealist mode,
filled with visual jokes and shock cuts— a shoe being shined turns
into a bare foot; a series of shots of a woman, seated in the same
position but each time in a different dress, ends with her nude.
Exuberant and disorderly, the film contrasts the staid, attenuated
life of Nice's posh hotels with the erotic carnivalesque energy of
its working-class back streets.
Historians have pointed out how this, Vigo's first film, presaged
the humanistic triumph of his L'Atalante, while Ruttmann after
1933 pursued his empty abstractionism as a Nazi propagandist.
PROPAGANDA,
POLITICS
Documentaries cannot escape analvsis of their ethical or didactic
purpose. From Vertov's Kino-Pravda newsreels (see Chapter 7) to
a later generation's notion of cinema verite (see Chapter 19), non-
fiction filmmakers have sometimes claimed that pointing a
camera at a subject (or assembling such shots at an editing table)
produced "filmed truth.
" Instead, most documentaries produce a
lively debate about what truth
is and whether the filmmaker has
come close to capturing
it. Unlike fiction films, which often dis-
tract us with their narratives and star performances,
documentaries usually expose the fact that a film's "reality"
is
constructed. They enable us to ask fundamental questions: Why
was the camera placed where
it was? Why did this shot follow
that one? What
is the film trying to tell us, and what means did
the filmmaker employ to present a viewpoint? These are neces-
sary questions for the 1930s revival of the documentary, which
was preeminently about presenting viewpoints.
BRITISH DOCUMENTARY
The first signs of documentary's resurgence came not in the totali-
tarian countries, where film industries were instruments of state
policy, but in Britain, where in a somewhat different manner state
policy decided to make use of film. The Empire Marketing Board
(EMB), a government body responsible for promoting products of
Britain,
its dominions, and
its colonies, began in the 1920s to
explore film as a means, as the board's secretary recalled, "for
bringing the Empire alive to the imagination of the public."
It
commissioned a feature-length film "which began gloriously with
shots of society ladies impersonating the different Dominions in
the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace."' The word "gloriously"
is used
in this context with ironv. A new approach was called for.
John Grierson
Seizing the opportunity was John Grierson (1898-1972), after
Flaherty and Vertov the most important figure in the development
of nonfiction film. Born
in Scotland, Grierson had gone to the
United States on a fellowship in the 1920s to study public opinion
and the media. There he became interested in film as a means of
public communication. Grierson,
in fact,
is credited with coining
the term c/ocumenfarv when he wrote in a 1926 review of
Flaherty's Moana that the film possessed "documentary value."
Inspired by Flaherty and Soviet filmmaking (Eisenstein rather than
Vertov, whose work was
little known outside the Soviet Union),
Grierson proposed to the EMB his plans to communicate social

actuality to a wide public through cinema, and the British docu-
mentary movement was born.
The first step was a pilot project, and Crierson took on the task
himself. The resulting film, Drifters (1929), was the only work of
Crierson's career in which he took primary credit as a filmmaker,
its subject was herring fishing in the North Sea, and though,
like
Flaherty,
it recorded humanity's encounter with the natural world.
Drifters reversed Flaherty's concern with the survival of tradition
in the face of modernity.
Its focus was on change: "Once an
idyll
of brown sails and village harbours," said the opening intertitle,
herring fishing "is now an epic of steam and steel." This, of
course, was in keeping with the EMB's mandate, and the film
stressed this modern industry's capacity to market
its harvest "to
the ends of the earth." Crierson cannily premiered Drifters on the
same program with the first British screening of Eisenstein's The
Battleship Potemkin. With the film's success, he was authorized
to set up an EMB Film Unit.
Crierson chose to make the Film Unit a training ground for
British documentary filmmakers, rather than a site for his own
personal creative work. He functioned thereafter, with few excep-
tions, primarily as a producer. Over one hundred films came out
of the Film Unit over the next four years.
In 1933, when the EMB
was closed, the Film Unit continued
its work for the Ceneral Post
Office (CPO). Fighting resistance from commercial film compa-
nies and exhibitors, Crierson fostered nontheatrical screenings,
traveling exhibitions, film libraries, and journals.
In 1938, after
leaving the CPO, he was commissioned by a newly established
body, the Film Committee of the Imperial Relations Trust, to eval-
uate government film endeavors in Britain's dominions. He went
first to Canada, and recommended the establishment of a govern-
ment film-producing unit there; the following year Canada's
National Film Board was set up, and Crierson accepted an offer
to become
its head. His visits to New Zealand and Australia in
1940 led to similar film boards in those countries.
Flaherty in Britain
Estranged from Hollywood and unsuccessful
in efforts to promote
projects in Cermany and the Soviet Union, Robert Flaherty
approached Crierson
in 1931 about making a film for the EMB.
Crierson eagerly accepted him, for Flaherty brought important
prestige to the new operation. But Flaherty's vision and his work-
ing methods were compatible with neither Crierson's budget nor
his goals, and their collaboration was brief. Flaherty's approach
was to shoot a great deal of footage of images that seemed to him
compelling and gradually develop a concept of what a completed
film might be about; Crierson could offer only limited funds and
film stock, and he had to answer to a government bureaucracy
which required a detailed script and shooting plan. Flaherty's
assigned subject was industrial work, and he became interested
in
the methods of potters and glassblowers, but he ran out of monev
long before he had enough material for a film. Crierson took over
the project, sent out cameramen for additional footage, wrote a
script, and edited the film, which was released as Industrial
Britain (1933). For this film and several others. The EMB struck a
deal with Caumont-British company to obtain access to sound-
recording facilities and add a music track and narration.
In history's light, the deal was not such a good one. Industrial
Britain's soundtrack makes
it the prototype of the heavy-handed
documentary. Though Flaherty's images are frequently memo-
rable, they are overpowered by the music of Beethoven and an
244

actor's voice delivering didactic commentar\' directly addressed
to the spectator: "And so \ou see, the industrial towns are not
quite so drab as they seem.
"
Its ideological message was that
modern industry depended on the personal skills of individual
workers, and
it aimed to give assurance that the British worker
took pride in tradition, craftsmanship, and quality. The film was
credited somew hat disingenuously as a Crierson-Flaherty copro-
duction iFlahertv was now here to be seen after his funds were
exhausted). Flaherty's name has kept
it alive among documentary
classics.
Industry was not really Flaherty's subject; much more vital to
him was the theme of humanity's survival in nature. His EMB
work was important primariK
for giving him access to the British
film industry, where he found producer Michael Balcon
(1896-1977), a key figure of 1930s British cinema who was also
Hitchcock's producer on The Man Who Knew Too Much and The
39 Steps, willing to put up a modest sum for a new documentary
feature. Flaherty wanted to make a film set in the Aran Islands,
in
the Atlantic west of Ireland, where people lived closer to modern
society than did the Eskimos of Nanook ot the North or the
Samoans of Moana, but still needed to wrest their living from the
sea. Setting up on Aran, complete with a makeshift laboratory to
process his rushes, Flaherty cast from the local populace a fic-
tional family (father, mother, son) and shot Man of Aran (1934),
his first sound feature documentary.
'In this desperate environment," reads an opening text, "the
Man of Aran, because his independence
is the most precious
privilege he can win from
life, fights for his existence, bare though
it may be." Though
it has strikingly beautiful footage of Aran's
rocky cliffs battered by waves, wind, and spray, the film was
controversial both in
its production and in
its reception. Critics
charged that Flaherty ignored the actuality of the islands to
substitute his own romantic vision, including the staging of a
long sequence of men in a small canoe capturing a mammoth
shark, an activity islanders had abandoned decades earlier.
In the 1970s American documentary filmmaker George C.
Stoney (b. 1916), whose father was born on Aran, visited the
islands and made with James B. Brown (b. 1950) a film about
Flaherty and Man ot Aran, called How the Myth Was Made
(19781. As a visual text,

analyses of documentary ever made.

Flaherty with his nineteen-
year-old assistant, John Taylor,
who went on to a distinguished
career in Britain as a documen-
tary cameraman, and the
spring-wound Newman Sinclair
camera with which most of Man
of Aran was shot.
It had a maga-
zine capacity of one hundred feet
of 35mm film, with a running
time of a little over one minute.
Dozens of magazines had to be
stored near shooting locations,
and Taylor had to reload after
almost everv take.
"Sometimes you have to
lie," Robert
Flaherty once said of documentary film-
making. "One often has to distort a thing
to catch
its true spirit." For Man of Aran
(1934), Flaherty wanted to capture the
spirit of indomitable people wresting a
living from nature on a barren island
west of Ireland.
It became the most con-
troversial embodiment of his filmmaking
principles— and one of the most docu-
mented of all documentary films,
in his
own writings,
in the memoirs of others,
and in the 1978 film by George C. Stoney
and James B. Brown, How the Myth Was
Made.
Pat Mullen, the Aran Islander whom
Flaherty chose as his go-between
in rela-
tions with other residents, described how
they went about finding people to appear
in the film: "This
is a method which
Flaherty followed in all his films. He
selected a group of the most attractive
and appealing characters he could find to
represent a family and through them he
aimed to tell a story.
It was always a long
and difficult process, this type finding,
for, as Flaherty said himself,
'It
is surpris-
ing how few faces stand the test of the
camera.'" Maggie Dirrane was chosen to
be the mother. Tiger King the father, and
Mikeleen Dillane the son,
in the made-
up family of the film.
Since Flaherty's aim was to show how
difficult was the islanders' struggle for
survival, he sometimes put his players
into situations where survival indeed
became a struggle. The filmmaker
recounted a scene in which "we had
Maggie coming up from the sea with a
heavy load of seaweed dripping on her
back," when she was unexpectedly hit
from behind by a breaking wave and
barely made
it to safety, with bleeding
cuts from having been thrown onto
rocks.
"I should have been shot for what
I
asked these superb people to do for the
film," Flaherty wrote, "for the enormous
risks
I exposed them to, and all for the
sake of a keg of porter and five pounds
apiece. But they were so intensely proud
of the fact that they had been chosen to
act in a film which might be shown all
over the world that there was nothing
they wouldn't do to make
it a success."
A school of basking sharks, averaging
twenty-seven feet in length, appeared off
the coast. "He was determined to include
a spectacular sequence showing the
islanders hunting these creatures with
harpoons," wrote Paul Rotha, a Flaherty
biographer, "even though no living Aran
man had ever handled a harpoon,
let
alone pursued a basking shark with
it.
They would have to be taught." Flaherty
prolonged production for nearly a year in
order to get the shots he wanted.

//.//.
Crierson and his col-
leagues also made films lor
sponsors other than government,
among which two works sup-
ported by the British Commercial
Gas Association were notable.
Housing Problems (1935), by
Arthur Elton and E. H. Anstey
was one of the first documentaries
to interview subjects on location;
here a woman talks about slum
conditions.
Sponsored Films
while continuing their work at the General Post Office, Crierson
and his colleagues sought to branch out and find commercial
sponsors for documentary filmmaking. The British Commercial
Cas Association agreed to finance several films, among which
were Housing Problems (1935), by Arthur Elton and
E. H. Anstey,
and Children at School (1937), produced by Crierson, directed by
Wright. The films dealt with deteriorating housing and schools,
respectively, and called for new construction, a socially progres-
sive proposal also primarily beneficial to the gas industry.
Housing Problems was among the first social documentaries to
use direct address by interview subjects and record ambient
sound on location. A mother talks about slum conditions, while
the baby she holds points at the camera, and a barking dog and
children's voices can be heard in the background.
FILMS OF THE LEFT
Crierson's model of government or commercially sponsored doc-
umentaries never lacked for critics. Particularly from the political
left, he was attacked for drawing filmmakers into a system that
would inevitably defend the status quo. Industrial Britain was a
hymn to the quality of British workers and products;
it had noth-
ing to say about the severe problems of an economic depression
that had put millions out of work. To address such social issues,
and to criticize government or industrial policies they held
responsible, other filmmakers organized in the early 1930s to pro-
duce documentary films.
United States
Leftist political filmmaking was not exactly without sponsorship
either.
In the United States, the Film and Photo League (FPL) was
formed
in 1930 under the auspices of Workers' International
Relief, an international Communist organization that ran
its own
film studio in Moscow and supported filmmaking activities in half
a dozen countries. Histories of leftist filmmaking in the United
States have not yet fully explored
its political party connections,
preferring to stress
its importance in documenting events ignored
or suppressed by Hollywood's newsreels.
The Film and Photo League launched the careers of several
important documentary filmmakers, including Leo Seltzer (b.
1910), Leo T. Hurwitz (1909-1991
), and Ralph Steiner (b. 1899).
Its cameramen covered political rallies and marches, capturing
historic footage of clashes between police and demonstrators, and
the U.S. Army's destruction of the Bonus March encamped
in
11.12.
Children at School (1937),
produced by Crierson and
directed by Wright, emphasized
the importance of schools in chil-
dren 's lives, as can be seen in this
shot of a nurse tending a child.
Washington, D.C.,
in 1932. Carrying hand-held equipment (and
working without sound), the cameramen got close to the action
and sometimes in the middle of confrontations. Footage was
edited and screened
in union halls, churches, and at FPL
branches in New York and other cities. Short films with titles such
as Unemployment Special (1931
) and Bonus March (1932) were
restored
in 1982.
By 1934 the Film and Photo League was split by factional dis-
putes about
its purposes: to concentrate solely on "newsreels and
documents of the class struggle," or to branch out into other forms
of filmmaking, involving, for example, scripts and acted scenes. A
group broke away and formed Nykino (combining New York and
the Russian word for camera) to pursue a more varied cinematic
practice, and, with other defections, the FPL soon dissolved. One
of the earliest experiments by filmmakers associated with Nykino
was Pie in the Sky (^935), a silent political comedy photographed
by Steiner, with Elia Kazan, the future Hollywood director, as one
of the performers.

The Surrealist filmmaker
Luis Bunuel made a documentary
in the 1930s about an impover-
ished region of Spain. Las Hurdes

is a bitter but also satiric com-
mentarv not only on social
conditions but also on the con-
ventions of nonaction
filmmaking.
Europe
European political filmmaking offered several models beyond the
newsreel, though the most prominent works had few imitators.
One was Luis Bunuel's Las Hurdes ithe title refers to a region of
Spain; the film's English title
is Land Without Bread), shot in 1932,
but not released until 1937. This was Bunuel's only nonfiction
film, but
it takes the form less of a straight documentar\' than of a
critique of the basic documentary concept from the perspective
of a Surrealist aesthetics.
B\' photographing a povert\'-stricken
rural region of Spain, and adding a sarcastic, outrageously humor-
ous voice-over narration, Buiiuel aimed to indict filmmakers and
spectators alike for the documentary genre's complicit\' in the suf-

La Vie est a nous (Life

political film sponsored by the
French Communist party for an

it depicts.
In a notorious sequence, a goat grazes on a
mountainside, as the voice-over warns of the steep terrain; then a
long shot shows a goat falling, with a visible puff of smoke sug-
gesting
it was no accident.
Another prominent political effort was La Vie est a nous (1936),
a feature-length film sponsored by the French Communist party
for an election campaign. Often credited to Jean Renoir,
it was a
collective work, with Renoir and three others directing different
segments. The film's strategy was both to expose and to transcend
received notions of documentary actuality.
It opens with a travel-
ogue-like sequence extolling the strengths of French agriculture
and industry, then shifts to a classroom where a teacher (played
by jean Daste, who portrayed the sympathetic teacher in Vigo's
Zero de conduite and the barge captain
in L'Atalante) repeats the
points, as
if the opening shots were from a film shown in school.
Later
it employs Surrealist techniques, showing Hitler and
Mussolini speaking, the former barking like a dog, the latter
sounding like a cannon.
In the film's second part a newspaper editor reads letters from
readers, and these shift into fictional sequences with professional
performers familiar from commercial fiction films. After three
such sequences,
all promoting Communist values and tactics, the
film shifts to speeches by party leaders, interspersed with shots of
the performers from the different acted sequences shown together
as part of an audience. No other film of the era, nor for years to
come, so thoroughly integrated actuality and fiction footage as
part of an overall design.
Joris hens
The most important political filmmaker of the decade— perhaps
of the century— was Joris Ivens (1898-1989). While others may
have matched or exceeded Ivens's more than sixty-year career as
a filmmaker, no one
is likely to have traveled so far and wide:
In
the 1930s alone he made films in his native Netherlands,
Belgium, the Soviet Union, Spain, China, and the United States;
after World War
II he added Australia, Eastern Europe, France,
Italy, Mali, Chile, Cuba, Vietnam, and China several times again.
These were not travel films but films of advocacy, yet always shot
with a visual sensitivity drawn from both his political aesthetic
and his early work as an avant-garde filmmaker.
250

ven :>
lolitical
filmmaker
Joris Ivens began as a filmmaker in the
Netherlands making short abstract films
of city scenes in the manner of Walther
Ruttmann's Berlin: Symphony of a Great
City. In 1927 he joined in forming a film
club in Amsterdam, the Filmliga, whose
aim was to screen new avant-garde works
made in France, Germany, and the Soviet
Union. Soon filmmakers also began
appearing at the screenings, among
whom was Vsevolod Pudovkin (see
Chapter 7), who invited Ivens to show his
films in the Soviet Union.
Ivens went, and he recounted in his
autobiography a screening before an
audience of workers. "One challenging
remark was—'Why are you afraid of
faces?
If you could look at a face with the
same frankness with which you look at a
raindrop you would be wonderful.' " The
comment made a deep impression on
him, Ivens wrote, and so did his other
experiences in the Soviet Union: he made
a film there, Komsomol {Song of Heroes,
1932), and returned as a committed polit-
ical filmmaker who devoted the next half
century largely to making propaganda
films for left-wing causes, many of which
were also outstanding works of documen-
tary art.
If anyone could claim lille to world
filmmaker,
it was Ivens. He made films on
six of the globe's seven continents,
excepting only Antarctica. Many of his
works were produced for government
agencies, including several
in the United
States. His flower and the Land
( 1940),
sponsored by the Rural Electrification
Administration of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, was perhaps the most effec-
tive film made to promote President
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal poli-
cies.
It focuses on a single farm family
and the ways that electricity brings
improvement to their productivity and
their lives. He also worked on a film for
the War Department documentary unit,
headed by Frank Capra, that produced
the "Why We Fight" series; called Know
Your Enemy: Japan,
it was completed but
not released because of changes in
United States policy that made the film's
perspective obsolete.
One of Ivens's longest and most signifi-
cant filmmaking relationships was with
China. After making Tlie 400 Million with
John Ferno in the 1930s, he returned to
China in the late 1950s to make several
short documentary films and again in the
early 1970s when, with Marceline
Loridan, he spent three years shooting
everyday Chinese life during the final
years of the Cultural Revolution. The
result was a series of twelve films, under
the overall
title How Yukong Moved the
Mountains (1972-74), on such subjects as
a Shanghai drugstore, worker discussions
at a generator factory, and a disciplinary
incident at a junior high school.

Misere au Borinage {Misery in Borinage, more generally known
simply as Borinage, 1933), made with Henri Storck, shows Ivens's
style in contrast to the newsreel approach of the American Film
and Photo League. Reporting on a labor struggle in a Belgian min-
ing district, the filmmakers spent a long period
in the community,
filming daily
life and following events as they affected individuals.
This gave the film an intimacy and sense of detail the newsreels
lacked. (Decades later Storck added a voice-over soundtrack to
this silent film, recording the live lecture that once accompanied
its screenings.)
Ivens's major works of the 1930s were The Spanish Earth (1937)
and The 400 Million (1939), a film about China codirected with
John Ferno. Both films were produced in the United States and
involved the participation of leaders in the arts and film industry.
Novelist Ernest Hemingway wrote and spoke the commentary on
The Spanish Earth, with music arranged by composers Marc
Blitzstein and Virgil Thomson, while screenwriter Dudley Nichols
wrote and actor Fredric March spoke the commentary on The 400
Million.
Aided by Hemingway's somber script and low-key delivery, The
Spanish Earth superbly demonstrates Ivens's approach. The film
opens simply,
in a village where people bake bread, farm, and
build an irrigation system. Thus rooted, the work widens out to
the Civil War between Fascist rebels and the Republican govern-
ment, never losing the immediacy of the personal.

tragedy the irrigation work continues, and the film ends with
water flowing into the fields.
Completed two years later. The 400 Million

tional documentary.
Its aim was to inform spectators about an
Asian war much less familiar than the Spanish struggle and the
increasing tensions in Europe. As early as 1931 Japanese troops
had taken control
in the Chinese territory of Manchuria. Full-scale
war between Japan and China broke out in 1937, and Japan's mili-
tary advance that year captured the major cities of Beijing (known
at the time as Peiping) and Shanghai. The 400 Million covers
these events through didactic historical and geographical explana-

tions, including maps with moving lines and actors' voices imper-
sonating Japanese generals. But the filmmakers also had another
purpose, which adds to the film's historical significance: as left-
ists, they wanted to publicize the role of the Chinese Communists
in fighting against the Japanese. They managed to include footage
of Communist leaders such as Zhou Enlai, who became China's
premier after the Communists gained power in 1949.
NAZI DOCUMENTARY
There were also documentaries made on the right wing of the
political spectrum
in the 1930s, notably in Nazi Germany. The
most famous of these are Triumph des Willens
( Triumph of the
Will. 1935) and Olympia (19381, both made by Leni Riefenstahl
(b. 1902). These have aroused more controversy than perhaps any
other nonfiction films yet made. Can we admire a film's artistry
and abhor the ideals
it propagates? "Triumph of the Will ctr\d
Olympia are undoubtedly superb films (they may be the two
greatest documentaries ever made)," Susan Sontag wrote in her
essay "Fascinating Fascism," "but they are not '•eally important in
the history of cinema as an art form."' The statement seems con-
tradictory and requires further exploration.
Riefenstahl was a dancer who began acting in an important
popular genre during the Weimar period, films about mountain
climbing and the mystique of the high Alps. In 1932 she directed
and starred in her own "mountain" film. Das blaue LichtiThe
Blue Light). Adolf Hitler
is said to have admired the spectacular
visual effects she achieved for night scenes with smoke bombs
and special
filters, and he invited her to make a film of the 1933
Nazi rally in Nuremberg for his private use. This led to the major
effort that went into filming the 1934 Nuremberg rally as Triumph
of the Will and the documentary on the 1936 Olympic Games
staged
in Berlin. After World War
II Riefenstahl was detained and
investigated for Nazi activities but ultimately cleared. In later
years she wrote that she had tried to get out of making the films,
and that in the case of Olympia, the Nazi party did not finance
it
and attempted to prevent
its release. Researchers have produced
documents refuting these claims.
Tnump>h of the Will
The 1934 Nazi party rally was not simply an event that was
filmed; rather
it was planned and constructed in considerable part
for the film that was to be made of
it. Later spectators, recalling
Hitler as an invincible dictator until his regime was defeated by
the Allies in World War
II, rarely have knowledge of the historical
context (nor
is the film much help for non-German speakers,
since the original full-length version has never been subtitled in
English). On June 30, 1934, Hitler purged Ernst Rohm, leader of
the SA (Sturmabteilung, or Storm Troopers, a paramilitary unit of
the National Socialist party), and ordered his execution: Rohm
had pushed for sweeping social changes after the Nazis seized
power, challenging Hitler's efforts to forge alliances with tradi-
tional military and conservative elites. Hitler planned the
September rally— and the film— as a carefully choreographed
pageant to show a nation united behind him, with support from
the army and loyal party officials.
Riefenstahl's film was central to this purpose, since
it would
create a vision of the event—beginning with the famous opening
sequence of Hitler's plane descending through the clouds over
Nuremberg—that no participant could have experienced. She
was provided with a staff of more than one hundred, along with
thirty cameras. Special elevators, platforms, ramps, and tracks
were constructed for her camera operators at the parade grounds
and throughout the city. In the resources at
its disposal. Triumph
of the W;7/ dwarfed all previous nonfiction films. The results are
often awesomely apparent, as in

For non-German spectators of the 1930s, what was remarkable
about Triumph of the Will was
its vivid revelation of a new poli-
tics mobilizing masses of people for public spectacle. The film's
style
is dedicated to driving that point home. Much of its last half
consists of parade footage, with images of close-drilled units,
fjags, salutes, and cheering crowds endlessly repeated, and

was given unprecedented support
for a documentary—more than
thirty cameras and events staged
for her film Triumph des Willens
(Triumph of the Will,
1935), a
documentary of the 1934 Nazi
party rally in Nuremberg. A per-
former in and director of a genre
of films about mountain climbing,
Riefenstahl gained the attention
of German dictator Adolf Hitler,
who enlisted her to film the rally
as a carefully choreographed
demonstration of his supporters'

marching music incessantly blaring on the soundtrack. The numb-
ing quality of these sequences seems purposeful, as
if to deprive
the spectator of mental ability, to force acquiescence in the
liter-
ally stunning power of the Nazi appeal. Riefenstahl's adherents
defend the film's artistry, arguing, as has critic Richard Meran
Barsam, that "At times, the spectacle
.
.
. soars beyond the insidi-
ous propaganda."'
Olymfpia
The Olympic Games documentary was planned differently, for a
different purpose. Germany had been awarded the 1936 Games
before Hitler seized power; his racist ideology made the Games
controversial. Riefenstahl's film aimed primarily to demonstrate
that the Berlin Olympics had been a fair and friendly event in
which athletes and spectators from many countries happily took
part. Hitler and other Nazi leaders were shown only as faces in
the crowd, cheering on the competitors.
Assessing Olympia
is complicated by the fact that the film now
exists in multiple versions. Circulating in the United States
is a
two-part film running three and one-half hours, with a voice-over
narration
in English.
In recounting the men's high jump the
English voice says, "America's great Negroes have the field to
themselves," one sign, among several, that in this version at least
the purpose was to highlight sportsmanship, rather than Nazi
Germany's notorious racist ideology.
in shooting and editing, Olympia was a more complex project
even than Triumph of the Will, and the film above all was a great
technical achievement. (German commentators pointed out that
the 1932 Olympics had been held in Los Angeles, home of the
Hollywood industry, but that no comparable effort had been
made to film the Games there.) The self-consciously "art"
sequences that have been extracted from the film— such as the
famous scene of men's diving— make up only a very small part,
and some were shot in empty stadia after the competition had

events, with use of slow-motion cinematography the principal
innovation.
Triumph of the Will and Olympia are important films in the his-
tory of cinema—they have had enormous impact both on films of
political persuasion and on sports films.
If Sontag
is correct in
"Fascinating Fascism" that they are not important in the history
of cinema "as an art form,"
it may be because their artistry
is
compromised by their propaganda goals. To say they are
"undoubtedly superb films"
is to be fascinated more by Fascism
than by film.
UNITED STATES
Among governments, the United States was slow to venture into
documentary filmmaking— except for educational films on sub-
jects such as how to milk a cow. Opposition from a powerful
commercial film industry was one roadblock. But the administra-
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt, establishing
its New Deal program
after 193.3, shared the documentary impulse of governments else-
where.
In 1935 the Resettlement Administration (later called the
Farm Security Administration) of the Department of Agriculture
set up a corps of still photographers to document social problems
and programs for change, and also hired Pare Lorentz (1905-
1992), a journalist and critic with no prior filmmaking experience,
to produce a film about agricultural conditions.
Lorentz turned to filmmakers whose work he knew, Ralph
Steiner, Leo T. Hurwitz, and Paul Strand (1890-1976),
all associ-
ated with the
leftist group Nykino. Conflicts soon emerged
between Lorentz and the others on both political and professional
grounds. Lorentz took their location footage, purchased stock
footage, and worked with composer Virgil Thomson
in coordinat-
ing the assemblage of sequences with a musical score. On the
finished film, The Plow that Broke the Plains (1936), Lorentz took
credit as writer and director. Like Grierson with Drifters, he pre-
miered his film
in Washington, D.C., on a program with European
government documentaries, including an excerpt from Triumph ot
the Will.
On his next project. The /?;Ver (1937), Lorentz used new cine-
matographers, including Floyd Crosby (1889-1985), who had

r/ze March of Time
Government filmmaking was not the onl> documentary innova-
tion of the 1930s. Another was The March of Time, a monthly
documentary series produced by Time magazine that began in
1935 and ran until 1951. Louis de Rochemont (1899-1978), a for-
mer newsreel cameraman and editor, developed the series from
an earlier March of Time radio broadcast. In contrast with the
brief news, sports, and feature clips that made up studio news-
reels, the March of Time releases ran around twenty-five minutes
and in the first years covered three subjects in depth; around 1938
they began focusing on a single topic. The series controversially
interspersed acted scenes and reconstruction of events along with
actuality footage.
Its hyperbolic narration and inverted syntax
were parodied by Orson Welles in the "News on the March"
sequence in Citizen Kane.

ganda, and national morale let no formal distinctions stand in the
way.

TWELVE
LM AND WORLD
Fin
contrast to other twentieth-century wars, World
War
II remains most vivid in popular memory through
its images on film. While novels and poetry shaped
the legacy of World War
I, and television news cover-
age captured the immediacy of later conflicts, the motion picture
camera mediated the 1939-45 war. The styles of genre entertain-
ment movies and actuality documentaries (which, as we have
seen, showed tendencies to mingle in both fiction and nonfiction
political and propaganda films of the 1930s) came even closer
together in the war years, to shape a vision of World War
II that
continues in wide cultural circulation as generations pass.
When World War
II began— as early as the mid-1930s in Asia,
September 1939 in Europe, and December 1941
for the United
States— no nation made the mistake France had done in World
War
I of halting film production. Cinema had risen to the status of
preeminent popular medium (television had begun broadcasting
on a limited experimental basis but was not to be commercially
developed until after the war). Joseph Goebbels's view that propa-
ganda
is best communicated through entertainment was put into
practice by every nation's film industry, while combat operations
were filmed for newsreels, documentaries, and military analysis.
In countries where theaters were still able to operate normally,
motion picture attendance climbed throughout the war, and
reached an all-time peak in the first postwar year.
UNITED STATES
FICTION FILMS
From the 1930s high to the wartime low in 1945, feature film pro-
duction fell by more than 40 percent in Hollywood, but studios
operated as usual, even with a number of key personnel in mili-
tary service, and profits soared. Much of the reduction was in
inexpensive "B pictures," developed
in the 1930s as the second
half of double feature screenings, which were no longer necessary
to attract audiences during the war. Genre production continued
largely as before— comedies, musicals, mysteries, and horror
films often seemed to have nothing to do with the war except to
proclaim that
life could go on as usual despite
it.
Government supervision of Hollywood production was insti-
tuted through a new agency, the Office of War Information
(OWI). Though
it lacked powers of direct censorship, OWI com-
municated war aims and policies to the studios and could block
films
it disliked from overseas distribution. Broadly speaking,
Hollywood welcomed guidance on war-related themes, and a
general consensus prevailed between the government and the
film industry. Among many propagandistic elements in
Hollywood war movies, such as repeated stress on the bravery of
the common soldier in combat, four major questions emerge from
the war films as a whole: What was the United States fighting
against, who was the enemy? How was
it possible for citizens to
understand that fighting the war was a choice for individuals, not
something forced upon them against their will? How was the
home front affected by war, and what changes could soldiers
260

expect on their return? And finally, what were the deeper ideolog-
ical implications of a struggle the United States defined as
between totalitarianism and democracy? We will examine these
principally through significant examples.
The Enemy
American cinema had a full stock of enemy images left over from
World War
I— dictatorial, aggressive, cruel to captive popula-
tions. These characteristics were carried over even into films made
by emigres from Nazi Germany,
in Hitler's Madman (1942),
directed by the former Detlef Sierck, now using the name Douglas
Sirk, and in Fritz Lang's Hangmen Also D/e (1943), with a script
cowritten by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht. Both works
were based on the assassination of Nazi leader Reinhard
Heydrich in occupied Czechoslovakia and the reprisals against
civilians that followed. Representations of the Japanese also fol-
lowed the treatment of treacherous Asians in World War i-era
films like Cecil B. DeMille's The Cheat.
The most significant film about the enemy was made before the
United States entered the war. Charles Chaplin began shooting
The Great D/cfator (1940) just as war broke out in Europe in 1939.
He planned
it as his first speaking performance (not having spo-
ken
in his previous sound films. City Lights and Modern Times).
bet they're asleep in New York.
I'll bet they're asleep all over
America," he adds, not referring to different time zones.'
Casablanca (1943) went into production six months after the
United States entered the war, but
its narrative events were placed
chronologically just before the Pearl Harbor attack. Rick's remarks
point to the nation's unreadiness for war: his later actions exem-
plify a capacity to be roused to fight.
An unlikely adaptation of an unproduced play, with frequent
script changes and an unknown finish until
it was time to shoot
the last scenes, Casablanca became nearly everyone's favorite
WoHd War
II movie.
It drew on familiar patterns in American
popular narrative, stretching across the genres from the detective
to the Western. A mysterious lone man, embittered by the past,
refuses communal solidarity. Then his lost love returns to confront
and console him, and he commits himself anew to his ideals.
With his sardonic style and the ambiguity of his screen image,
Bogart made a persuasive hero, and Swedish actress Ingrid
Bergman gave their love scenes powerful romantic poignancy.
The film was also unobtrusively an all-star production of
European emigre performers, including Conrad Veidt, the som-
nambulist of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, as the Nazi Major
Strasser, and Marcel Dalio, from Renoir's Grand Illusion ar\6
Rules of the Game, as a croupier.
WAR
Its premise was the resemblance, often noted in the 1930s,
between Chaplin and Adolf Hitler, who were coincidentally born
four days apart. Chaplin plays two roles. Adenoid Hynkel, dictator
of Tomainia, and a Jewish barber. The film's treatment of Nazism
through comedy and
its focus on the persecution of Jews were
both more daring than later wartime depictions of the enemy.
Even half a century later the shifts in tone can strike a viewer as
painful.
For cinema history one of The Great Dictator's small delights
is
its parody of Triumph of the Will. Hynkel spouts gibberish
German while crowds cheer on cue and marching music blares,
and children and mothers in peasant garb greet the dictator, with
an off-color embarrassing result. The film also more generally
mocks documentary voice-over narration (not a part of Triumph
of the Will), suggesting even as parody how central documentary
forms would be to fictional representation
in the war years.
The Choice
Before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, United States public
opinion had been sharply divided about participation in the war.
One of the wartime motifs was to show involvement in the war as
a moral transformation of individuals, from indifference to com-
mitment. The decisive event was the Japanese attack itself,
depicted as a betrayal of trust that wiped away petty confusions
and demanded retaliation. "Sam,
if it's December 1941
in
Casablanca, what time
is
it in New York?" Rick (Humphrey
Bogart) says to the piano player portrayed by Dooley Wilson. "I
The Home Front
Though unlike most belligerent countries the continental United
States was not a site of combat, one theme of wartime policy was
to assert a unity between battlefront and "home front." Like so
much else in American ideology and arts, this found
its strongest
expression on the level of the personal.
It was out of individual
relations that any social implications could be drawn.
The epic home front movie was 5/nce You Went Away (1944),
directed by John Cromwell (1887-1979), with a screenplay
by
its producer, David O. Selznick. "This
is a story of the
Unconquerable Fortress: the American Home," the film begins,
and over its three-hour duration
it shows what happens in a
middle-class family, living on Suburban Drive, when a
husband/father goes to war, leaving behind a wife and two teen-
age daughters. The wife (Claudette Colbert) moves from
loneliness and money worries, to news that her husband
is miss-
ing in action, to training as a "lady welder" at a shipyard.
Immensely sentimental, with violins tugging at your heartstrings
(Max Steiner won the Academy Award for musical score), the film
weaves among its private tragedies and triumphs the questions of
society at large: Was the United States fighting to make a better
world, or to restore a
life that war had temporarily disrupted?
Ideology
These questions of why the nation was fighting led to even larger
ones: What sort of people were Americans, and what were their
values?
It was of course enormously difficult to address such
issues in film dramas. Often an attempt took the form of the

With millions of military personnel on the
move during World War
II, film industries
in the belligerent countries made various
efforts to provide motion picture propa-
ganda and entertainment to their armed
forces. The best-documented endeavors
were those of the Hollywood movie com-
panies and their employees. Many
creative and craft workers went into
regular service, others made military
documentaries and combat films. Star
performers went overseas for personal
appearances behind the battlefronts or
promoted government sales of war bonds.
Less than six weeks after the United
States entered the war, actress Carole
Lombard (1908-1942) was killed
in an
airplane crash while returning to
Hollywood from an appearance at a war-
bond rally in Indianapolis.
In the motion picture community, per-
formers Bette Davis and John Garfield
took the lead
in founding the Hollywood
Canteen, emulating the Stage Door
Canteen in New York's theater district.
This was a club open to military person-
nel where movie personalities
entertained, mingled, or performed
chores.
A 1944 Warner Bros, film, Hollywood
Canteen, celebrates the endeavor and
more generally Hollywood's contribution
to the war effort, with several dozen per-
formers appearing in the film as
"themselves."
It opens on a Pacific island
with a motion picture unit arriving with
mail and films. Then servicemen return
on a Red Cross ship and arrive at the
Hollywood Canteen. When a wounded
soldier (a fictional figure in the film, por-
trayed by an actor) meets Bette Davis
there, he refers to her in her fictional role
in Mr. Skeffington (1944) and says,
"I saw
you on the hospital ship before you were
ever released on the mainland. We see
the newest pictures before you do."
Another fictional soldier meets Garfield
and says, "Hi, Johnny.
I saw you
last in
Italy" (where Garfield had gone in 1943
to entertain troops). "Sure," Garfield
replies, "south of Cassino.
I remember."
"I used to figure that Hollywood was a
place with all false fronts," says an actor
performing as an enlisted man. "Nothing
false about them we've seen tonight. All
those famous people being friendly and
democratic."

did not make

returning servicemen's
unabated movie loyalty and
desire. The small print at the

The noted Hollywood
director Frank Capra was called
upon by the United States War
Department to produce a series of
aims explaining to military per-
sonnel the background of World
War II and United States war
aims. The seven titles in the 'Why
We Fight" series were compiled
from existing documentary and
newsreel footage, with acted
scenes, trick effects, and anima-
tion added. Capra directed onl\
the first film. Prelude to War
(1942), which chronicled the rise
of dictatorships in Germany,
Italy,
and Japan with scenes such as
this, depicting an Italian child
being taught to give a Fascist
salute.
"melting pot" platoon or creu, as in Destination Tokyo (1943),
about a submarine reconnaissance mission to )apan; though eth-
nicities and regions varied from film to film, there were typically
an Eastern or Southern European— from Poland, say, or Greece,
both countries invaded by German\— as well as a Jew, a middle
westerner, an l\y Leaguer, and a southerner, subsuming their dif-
ferences in common purpose to win the war. This presupposed an
enemy, so the question came full circle, Americans defining
themselves in opposition to their foe.
Alfred Hitchcock's
/.//iefaoaf (1944i, based on a storv' by novelist
John Steinbeck, was one of the few films that took on the question
head-on. A Nazi U-boat (submarinei torpedoes a freighter, and
survivors gather in a lifeboat: wealthv and working class, men and
women, black and white. They are joined by a German survivor,
the U-boat captain, who conceals his rank, his English, and his
compass. Torn bv jealousy, rivalrv, indecision, lack of leadership,
the "democrats
" are easv prey for the "totalitarian," who takes
command and steers the boat toward his supply ship. Finallv, in a
frenzy of anger \\ hen the German pushes a wounded man over-
board, the others gang up and beat the German to death. The film
ends ambiguouslv, suggesting no more than that an individualist
society
is capable of frantic retaliation when sufficiently provoked
by unmitigated evil.
UNITED STATES
DOCUMENTARIES
HollvAvood entertainment films, no matter how patriotically moti-
vated, could not b\ themselves adequateK represent the war on
film. The documentarv impulse of the 1930s carried over into a
desire to record as much as possible of the war itself, and training
thousands of militarv
recruits also called for visual communica-
tion. Among the filmmakers who went to work in militan,'
documentary' were many from HollsAvood's creative talent and
craft workers, including such major directors as Frank Capra, John
Ford, William Wvler, George Stevens, and John Huston.
Why We Fight
The politicalK most important assignment went to Capra. He uas
asked to superv ise a series of films explaining the background and
goals of United States involvement in the war to service person-
nel, many of whom had scarcely paid attention to world events.
This became the "VVh\ We Fight" series, seven films that all U.S.
Arm> soldiers were required to see and were also released for the-
atrical distribution both in the United States and overseas. These
are remarkable cinematic documents,
in part because the\ were
produced with
little bureaucratic supervision. Capra claims in his
265

autobiography that when he asked the chief of staff, General
George C. Marshall, what to do
if he could not find out what U.S.
policy was, the general replied, "In those cases make your own
best estimate, and see
if they don't agree with you
later."-'
The films, each approximately an hour long, began with
Prelude to War (1942); this was followed by The Nazis Strike,
Divide and Conquer, The Battle of Britain, and The Battle of
Russia in 1943, The Battle of China in 1944, and War Comes to
America in 1945. Capra took full directorial responsibility only for
the inaugural film; Anatol Litvak (1902-1974) and Anthony Veiller
(1903-1965) directed the others. Although he expressed awe at
Triumph of the Will (which he screened after taking his assign-
ment, and from which he took footage), Capra emulated more
The March of Time. Prelude to War was a film of compilation and
montage:
It linked together actuality footage, acted scenes, trick
effects (Japanese troops marching in Washington, D.C.), and
animation.

12.8. Another documentary pro-
duced by Capra's unit. The Negro
Soldier (7944;, directed by Stuart
Heisler extolled the commitment
of blacks to the war effort, with-
out reference to the fact that the
United States armed forces were
racially segregated during World
War
II.
"What made us change our way of living overnight?" asks actor
Walter Huston
in the voice-over narration, and the seven films set
out to answer that question, mostly by depicting the enemy's evil
ambitions. The principles for which the United States was fighting
were stated largely by symbol and inference: religious freedom;
freedom from ideological indoctrination; freedom to be
left alone.
The Negro Soldier
After completing the "Why We Fight" series, the production team
Capra had assembled went on to produce another half-dozen
documentaries, most significantly The Negro Soldier {]944),
directed by Stuart Heisler. This film was fraught with implications:
though the "Why We Fight" series did not explicitly proclaim the
United States a land of justice and equality,
it did condemn the
enemy nations for injustice and inequality, particularly on racial
grounds. Yet one of the U.S. institutions that remained racially seg-
regated was the Army. Thus the film became in effect, "Why
African-Americans Should Fight."

Several Hollywood direc-
tors took hand-held 16mm
cameras tloaded with color film)
to film military action for combat
documentaries. John Ford shot
much of the ground footage for a
film about a major engagement in
the Pacific war The Battle of
Midway (1942); another camera-
man, Kenneth M.
Pier, recorded
scenes of air combat such as the
one pictured here.
Religious freedom was again a touchstone. The film
is framed
as a church service, and
its narrative thread
is a clergyman's ser-
mon.
It gives a capsule history of black involvement in American
military struggles— neglecting to mention the fact of slavery— and
shows black heroes like the high-jump champions of the 1936
Olympic Games (using footage from Olympia). Though
it fol-
lowed conventional compilation documentary style. The Negro
Soldier could not help but be radical
in content.
It could not jus-
tify racial segregation;
it went out of its way to find scenes of
blacks and whites together in military settings. This was a case of
General Marshall's words coming true: President Harry S Truman
integrated the armed forces by executive order after World War
II.

William Wyler, with other

William Wyler (1902-1981

tor on The Negro Soldier but left the project when he got a
chance to make a combat documentary about a B-17
"Flying
Fortress" daylight air raid over Germany. The circumstances
forced a drastic change in technique, especially for Wvler, notori-
ous in Hollwvood as a meticulous director who sometimes shot
the same scene dozens of times before he was satisfied. His
equipment for the documentan.' was hand-held 16mm cameras,
loaded with color stock (John Ford earlier had shot color combat
footage in 1942 for his seventeen-minute film of a decisive naval
engagement in the Pacific, The Battle of Midway). Wvler and two
other cameramen shot the footage, flying on combat missions at
29,000 feet in the unpressurized B-17s, where temperatures fell to

acy in
its low-key directness.
It served as the source for a 1990
British fiction film, Memphis Belle, directed by Michael Caton-
)ones.
John Huston
Director John Huston (1906-1987) made two of the most impor-
tant U.S. war documentaries, though one was altered and the
other suppressed by military authorities. The Battle of San Pietro
(1945) was the record of an infantry operation in southern Italy
that cost heavy casualties.
It has none of the glory or triumph of
war, as even The Memphis Belle does; instead
it shows th.^t war is
hellish and men die. The film was at first withheld, then released
in a half-hour version, a third shorter than
its original length
(some of the cut scenes show children's fear as U.S. forces enter
their village, and American soldiers giving them candy to make
them smile for the camera). Both versions currently circulate.
After the war Huston went to a hospital on Long Island, New
York, to make an Army documentar\ on
"the psychoneurotic sol-
dier"—men who suffered mental disturbance in the war. The tone

Like other forms of filmmaking, animation
lent
its services to the military struggle
during World War
II. One of the first
examples of animation in wartime propa-
ganda was a three-minute film, Musical
Poster if! (1940), made for the British
Ministry of Information by New Zealand
artist and filmmaker Len Lye (1901-1980).
Lye had been making films for the CPO
Film Unit in a style he called "direct film,"
drawing or painting directly onto the cel-
luloid film strip.
In Musical Poster
if I, to a
soundtrack of jazz music, he animated
words to spell out the message, "Careful!
The enemy
is listening to you." The film
ends with animated letters spelling out
"Shh!" with an image of a swastika, a
symbol of Nazi Germany.
The Scottish-born Norman McLaren
(1914-1987), who had been a colleague
of Lye's at the GPO, was invited by John
Grierson to set up an animation unit at
Canada's National Film Board, where he
launched a career as an acclaimed exper-
imental animator with war-related
animations, beginning with Mail Early
and Vfor Victory ibolh 1941). His Keep
Your Mouth Shut (1944) was a more blunt
and disturbing treatment of Lye's theme of
Musical Poster #/: the necessity for
wartime security.
But the most extensive role for anima-
tion during the war was played by
Hollywood's cartoon characters. The U.S.
Treasury Department commissioned a
film from Walt Disney about the impor-
tance of paying taxes, and
it turned into
one of the studio's most memorable films
of the war era, Der Fuehrer's Face (1943),
featuring Donald Duck as a recalcitrant
worker in a country ruled by the Nazis.
It
won an Academy Award for animated
cartoons. Warner Bros, produced more
than two dozen comedy shorts for a
biweekly military film program, the Armv-
Navy Screen Magazine, that played along
with feature films at U.S. military bases;
it
featured a character, Private Snafu, whose
name was the slang acronym for the
phrase "situation normal— all (fouled)
up."
Perhaps the most militant of the car-
toon figures was the Warner Bros,
character Bugs Bunny, the sassy rabbit
with the greeting, "What's up, doc?" Bugs
was shared among several leading car-
toon directors at the studio, including
Chuck Jones (b. 1912) and Fred "Tex"
Avery (1908-1980), but most of Bugs's
war cartoons were directed by Isadore
(Friz) Freleng (b. 1906). These included
Hare Force and Bugs Bunny Nips the
Nips (both 1944), the latter a work that
displayed the racism of wartime propa-
ganda.
Freleng's Herr Meets Hare (1945) has
Bugs burrowing up from underground in
Germany's Black Forest and encountering
the Nazi field marshal Hermann Coring.
Bugs cows the Nazi by impersonating first
Adolf Hitler and then BriJnnhilde, the
goddess of Richard Wagner's Ring cycle

the Nazis a climactic fright by popping

BRITAIN
Britain entered World War
II more than two years before the
United States, declaring war on Germany on September 3, 1939,
after the German invasion of Poland. In Jul\ 1940 Germanx began
bombing British cities, and in September inaugurated Uvo months
of nightly air attacks on London—what the British called the
Blitz, after the German word Blitzkrieg, or lightning warfare. On
the cinema front the response uas a ten-minute film, London Can
Take /f (1940), nan-ated bv American journalist Quentin Reynolds,
and intended primarilv for United States audiences.
As the film shows actualiU footage of London under the bombs
—the blackout, underground shelters, houses destroved, buses
upturned, buildings in rubble— Re\ nolds speaks of "a surging
spirit of courage the likes of w hich the world has never know n."
The film sounded a theme that would shape Britain's wartime ide-
ology', that "the people
" formed an arm\ w hose unconquerable
spirit would prevail.
London Can Take /f carries no credits other than Revnolds's
name.
Its status as a work of reportage might have been undercut
had
it been made clear that the producer was the British Ministry
of Information. The GPO Film Unit isee Chapter 11
1 had been
placed under that ministry earlier in 1940 and renamed the
Crown Film Unit. Harry Watt, of Night Mail, and Humphrey
Jennings codirected the film.
HumphreyJennings
After London Can Take
It, Jennings (1907-1950) emerged as the
leading figure in British wartime documentarv filmmaking.
Though he had joined the GPO Film Unit as early as 1934, other
interests occupied him during the 1930s: He was a Surrealist
painter and poet, and took part in a project called Mass
Observation that combined anthropological and Surrealist interest
in daily living. He developed a poetic but also comic-ironic
approach to evervdav
life that worked effectivelv
in his films to
convev a vision of Britain's popular spirit in wartime.
Jennings's first important film was Listen to Britain (1942), co-
directed w ith Stuart McAlister. "Blended together in one great

ing the film through direct address to the spectator. These words
link Listen to Britain to earlier "city symphonies" such as
Ruttmann's Berlin and Vigo's A Propos de Nice, though those
symphonies had been silent. Jennings and McAlister showed the
value of mixing sound and image. They mingled the music of a
Mozart piano concerto with the noise of a factory, and through
visual editing created a montage of popular and high culture,
industry and the natural landscape, forming harmonious national
unity.
Fires Were Started ^943), at sixty-four minutes Jennings's
longest film, combined actuality footage and acted scenes with
nonprofessionals in a narrative of firefighting (German planes
dropped incendiary bombs so the fires they started could over-
come the blackout and help locate targets). The "players" are the
men and women of the fire brigade, and the film's observations of
their off-duty activities counterpoint the slowly building drama of
the fire,
in which one of the men dies. Fires Were Started was the
most elaborate instance of the documentary form of which Niglit
Mail and The March of Time were prototypes, using performance
to give human depth to the recording of actual events.
Fiction Films
if films like Fires Were Started pushed the documentary in the
direction of fiction, then the necessity of representing war equally
impelled fiction films toward documentary. In Which We Serve
(1942), a fiction film about a Royal Navy ship, opens with a
sequence combining actuality footage, acted scenes, and special
effects cinematography to construct a complex image of battle.
On the ship's bridge one man remarks that the vista of sea and
clouds resembles a calendar illustration; "art parts company with
reality," contradicts the captain, noting dryly that calendar pic-
tures do not include enemy air squadrons. These are surely also
self-reflexive words, highlighting the ways cinema— in a continu-
um from documentary through fiction—mixed artistry and
actuality in
its efforts to portray the experience of war.
War had a positive effect on British cinema. On
its smaller
scale, the British industry went through the same changes as
Hollywood. The drop in production averaged around 40 percent,
but theater attendance reached all-time highs. Audience and
critical responses suggested that fewer pictures resulted in higher-
quality films, and the themes of war and patriotism boosted
exports to commonwealth countries and the United States.
Resources, personnel, and script approval were controlled more
tightly by the Ministry of Information than was the case with OWI
in the United States, and at least one fiction film was partly
financed by the ministry, The 49th Parallel (^94^
), directed by
Michael Powell.
IN WHICH WE SERVE. A representative work of wartime
British cinema, so far as one film can stand in for several hundred,
was In Which We Serve.
It was the most popular British film of
the early war years and also a major success in the United States,
where a special Academy Award was given to Noel Coward
(1899-1973), the actor and playwright who wrote, produced,
and starred
in the film, as well as codirecting with David Lean
(1908-1991
). In Which We Serve was an idealized and ideo-
logical portrait of Britain at war as were Casablanca and Since
You WenMway for the United States, and the differences are
illuminating.
The film centers on a Royal Navy destroyer sunk during the

SOVIET UNION
It
is misleading to suggest that the Soviet Union entered World
War
II
in 1941, since the Soviets attacked Poland and Finland
in
1939 and annexed the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and
Estonia
in 1940. But Germany's invasion of Russia
in June 1941
altered war strategy and brought the Soviets into alliance with
Britain, the United States, and other countries fighting against
Germany and Japan. The Soviet defense of Moscow in late 1941
was the subject of a feature documentary completed in eady
1942, Rjzgrum nemetzkikh voisk pod Moskvoi {Defeat of the
German Armies near Moscow), which as Moscow Strikes Back
won one of several Academy Awards given in 1942 for documen-
tary (along with Prelude to IVtirand The Battle of Midway).
Ivan the Terrible
By the time of the battle of Moscow, the Moscow and Leningrad
film industries had been moved over a thousand miles to Alma-
Ata, an Asian city near the Chinese border.
It was there that Sergei
Eisenstein made Ivan grozny (Ivan the Terrible), the only Soviet
fiction feature of the war years to have circulated widely.
Conceiving the film first in two and then in three parts, Eisenstein
completed Part
I
in 1944.
It was released
in 1945 and won a
major Soviet award, the Stalin Prize,
in 1946. The director finished
Part
II
in early 1946, shortly before he suffered a heart attack.
During his convalescence. Part
II was condemned and sup-
pressed, and completed sections of Part
III destroyed. Ivan the
Terrible, Part
II was finally released in 1958, a decade after
Eisenstein's death.

Few films make tor simple readings, but Ivan the Terrible is
more complicated than most. Are Parts
I and
II separate films, a
two-part unit, or segments of an uncompleted trilogy? Answer: all
of the above. Which takes precedence, the films' politics or their
artistry? Like Alexander Nevsky, Ivan the Terrible was a historical
film with contemporary meaning. The sixteenth-century czar Ivan
IV unified the country, fought wars, and battled against traitors to
his rule— accomplishments the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin might
also have wished to claim.
It
is impossible not to regard Ivan the
Terrible as historical allegory, especially because Stalin personally
disapproved of Part
II on the grounds that the film's czar was
indecisive and insufficiently ruthless against his enemies.
Yet amidst the politics, and perhaps inseparable from them,
stand the films' artistic achievements. Ivan the Terrible is a tri-
umph not of montage but of mise-en-scene— of set design, decor,
273

and costumes; of carefully choreographed framing (as in the
famous conclusion to Part
I, where the czar observes the snaked
columns of supporters bidding him to return to Moscow); and
above all of the strongly theatrical linkage between the images
and Sergei Prokofiev's musical score. In Part
II, Eisenstein shot his
first sequences in color, using
it in expressionist ways to convey
states of mind, rather than with the naturalistic norms of
Hollywood.
GERMANY, ITALY, JAPAN
The wartime cinemas of the countries that were defeated
Germany,
Italy, and Japan— have been to considerable extent
consigned to historical oblivion. This
is understandable. Citizens
of those countries may not wish to remember the artistic products
of regimes that brought defeat, disgrace, and hardship, and peo-
ple from other countries abhor works of propaganda— such as
Germany's anti-Semitic films or Japan's films about military tri-
umphs in Asia— that justify criminal policies. With few exceptions
surviving films are confined to archives and are screened only by
specialists. Yet they are part of the historical record of world cin-
ema and need to be understood no less fully than the films of
countries that were on the winning side.
Nazi Cinema
Germany's wartime films have in particular disappeared from
wider purview. Two notorious anti-Semitic films were made soon
after the war started, Der ewige jude (The Eternal jew, 1940),
described as a documentary, directed by Fritz Hippler, and jud
SiJss (Jew Suss, 1940), a fiction film directed by Viet Harlan
(1899-1964) and featuring, among other performers, Werner
Krauss, who had played Dr. Caligari. After the war Harlan was
twice put on trial by Allied authorities
in occupied Germany for
"crimes against humanity" for his role in making judSuss. This
was considered a test case, but after both trials ended inconclu-
sively for lack of evidence, further prosecutions were not
attempted.
Early in the war several major combat documentaries also were
produced, including Feldzug in Polen (Campaign in Poland,
1939), also directed by Hippler, and Feuertaufe (Baptism of Fire,
1940), directed by Hans Bertram (b. 1906), which presented
Germany's enemies as the aggressors and showed German mili-
tary success as occurring without harm to others. But as war
progressed both overt propaganda and combat documentaries
were supplanted by a policy of making primarily genre fiction
films, especially historical films and contemporary melodramas of

private
life. The historical t'ilms were allegories addressed to ideo-
logical concerns of the Nazi regime, but Propaganda Minister
Joseph Coebbels, who gained even greater power after 1942,
held more strongly than ever that a society that was living the
tenets of National Socialism needed entertainment from
its films.
"On the whole, the film industry abandoned political and military
subjects in favour of love stories and operettas," film historian
David Welch has written;
"it gave the people what they wanted,
but
.
.
. failed to capture the contemporary experiences of the
masses undergoing total war."^
Fascist Italy
The Fascist government's efforts to develop Italian cinema
reached a peak in the war year 1942, when 119 films were
released. But Italy's war fortunes turned earlier than
in Germany
or Japan. Mussolini was ousted
in 1943; his successors surren-
dered to the Allies, but German troops occupied most of the
country (a puppet Fascist regime was set up in northern
Italy), and
war continued until 1945. Under the circumstances, film produc-
tion fell sharply after 1943. Nevertheless, there was a sense of
continuity in Italian cinema, principally because Italian Fascism,
unlike German Nazism, gave certain leeway to diverse viewpoints
among the filmmakers
it trained and allowed to work (see
Chapter 10).
The strongest case in point was Ossessione ("Obsession,"
1942), the first film directed by Luchino Visconti (1906-1976).
Visconti began his film career in the 1930s in France as an assis-
tant to Jean Renoir, who suggested Ossess/one's source, James M.
Cain's hard-boiled American novel The Postman Always Rings
Twice; French director Pierre Chenal had already adapted this for
a film, Le Dernier tournant
( The Last Turning, 1939).
It
is no sur-
prise that Fascist authorities were upset by this tale of adultery and
murder, considering that Hollywood's Production Code
Administration prevented the book from being filmed for over a
decade. For copyright reasons Ossessione was not released
in the
United States or Britain until the mid-1970s (M-G-M owned rights
to the book, and was able to make its own film in 1946);
it was
never given an English-language title and continues to be known
by
its original name.
Though
it was suppressed in Fascist Italy, Ossessione was
allowed to be made, and became one of the most important films
of the war years.
It broke decisively with the "white telephone"
genre of Italian Fascist cinema, as well as the allegorical and his-
torical modes of Blasetti's films.
It was set in a provincial roadside
trattoria, where an unhappy wife and a wandering mechanic
strike up the passion of the film's title. Adapting Renoir's moving
camera and long-take shooting style and utilizing the gritty blunt-
ness of Cain's prose, Visconti constructed a vision of desperation
and rootlessness in contemporary Italy that stood in stark contrast
to Fascist rhetoric and art.
Jap^an
With
its military fighting in China, Japan began making war-
related films as early as 1938. The Japanese military government
took control of the film industry with laws modeled after Nazi
Germany's film policies. Historians have debated to what extent
those laws were actually put into practice— in other words,
whether filmmakers were able to pursue their own artistic goals
275

or were forced to follow military directives. Filmmakers and schol-
ars alike favor the view that
it was possible to circumvent or
undercut the orders, but
it seems clear that few
if any films were
made that did not satisfy military needs.
If directors were unwill-
ing to make so-called national policy films they did not work; one
example was Yasujiro Ozu, who made only two films between
1937 and 1947.
When Hollywood directors like Frank Capra screened Japan's
first propaganda films from 1938, like Chokoreto to heitai
{Chocolate and Soldiers), and Conin no sekkohei {Five Scouts),
they were surprised at how low-key and indirect they were, com-
pared, for example, to the style developed for the "Why We Fight"
series. Rather than focusing on enemy evils, as the U.S. films did,
they centered on the Japanese soldier and the obligations of duty
and self-sacrifice. In this they more greatly resembled British than
American wartime films, and no doubt indicated fundamental dif-
ferences in national ideology and concepts of the individual's
relation to the state.
Fiction films also pursued the same themes, often through the
genre of historical or period dramas. Kenji Mizoguchi directed the
nearly four-hour, two-part Gcnroku Chushingura {The Loyal 47
Ronin, 1941-42), based on a famous eighteenth-century legend
about feudal loyalty that was a fixture of Japanese theater and had
been previously filmed more than a dozen times. Japanese film
historian Tadao Sato expressed a common critical ambivalence
about this and similar works when he wrote, "These historical
movies did not directly endorse militarism and can be considered
progressive because the directors adhered strictly to historical
accuracy. However, [they stressed] the idea of compliance with
the times and the theme of the Japanese people as a fated, com-
mon body."^
The most important debut by a filmmaker in wartime japan was
by Akira Kurosawa (b. 1910), who directed his first film, Sugata
Sanshiro {Sanshiro Sugata),
in 1943. This was also a historical film
but set in the Meiji era of the late nineteenth century.
It recounts
the training and exploits of a judo champion. A remarkable first
film, with a style based on supple pans and tracking shots,
Kurosawa treats
it casually in his autobiography as a work of
entertainment that military censors did not like. Yet one can see
how
its emphasis on dedication, purity, and fate places
it well
within the thematics of the "national policy" films.

In
its military expansion throughout Asia during World War
II,
Japan controlled cinema production in Korea, Manchuria, Taiwan,
and those areas of China and Southeast Asia that
it occupied. This
filmmaking activity has only begun to be studied. In a number of

it exemplifies sev-
eral of the themes of Japan's
wartime "national policy" films.
European countries occupied b\' Germany during World War
II, a
curtain has tigurativeK been drawn over wartime filmmaking. The
principal exception
is the careful scrutiny that has been given to
one of the world's major film industries,
in France, during German
occupation between 1940 and 1944.
France
The situation in France was enormously complex. After the
French surrender in June 1940, only the northern part of the
countrs was directiv occupied bv German forces, while both parts
were run by a collaborationist government based in Vichy.
Meanwhile, French forces outside the country under General
Charles de Gaulle fought on the side of the Allies, and a
Resistance movement organized within. Making films under the
Vichy government was seen by many as an act of collaboration
with the enemy, while others thought that filmmaking could be
oppositional. Meanwhile, Jean Renoir, Rene Clair, Boris Kaufman,
and other directors and film personnel went into exile in
Hollvwood.
On Germany's part, as film historian Evelyn Ehrlich has ana-
lyzed
it, there were positive reasons to encourage French
filmmaking: to provide entertainment for the French population;
to gain profit from investment in French films; to assert the point
that German domination could prove benevolent in fostering
277

indigenous cultural production; and to bolster the one film indus-
try that seemed capable of contesting Hollywood's domination.
More than two hundred films were made in France from 1941
to
1944, with production dropping off sharply after the Allied inva-
sion at Normandy in June 1944.
The most important filmmaker from the prewar era of poetic
realism to remain
in France was Marcel Came. Like filmmakers in
many other countries, he turned from contemporary to historical
themes in his wartime work. The most famous film of his career,
Les Enfants du paradis {Children of Paradise), was produced over
several years during the German occupation but withheld from
release until March 1945. This three-hour epic of theatrical and
boulevard
life in nineteenth-century Paris was a tribute to popular
traditions, and postoccupation France hailed
it as an expression of
the continuity and survival of French spirit.
A far more controversial wartime film was Le Corbeau {The
Raven, 1943), directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot (1907-1977).
The film begins with a sour tone and grows progressively meaner,
nastier, and uglier. A small-town doctor begins to receive anony-

Marcel Carrie's epic Les
Enfants du paradis (Children of
Paradise), made during World
War
II, was hailed on its release
in March 1945 as testimony to
the endurance of the French
spirit. The film's narrative was set
amid the popular culture of
mid-ninetcenth-century fans. An
actress, Carance (portrayed by
Arletty), mingles with admirers on
the Boulevard du Temple, street

turns out, writes them. The doctor, plaved by Pierre Fresnay (who
portra\ed Marius in Pagnol's Marseilles trilogy and Boeldieu in
Renoir's Grand Illusion), seems to grow in moral strength through
his ordeal, but he
is powerless to prevent his betraval of another.
Le Corbeau was attacked b\ the right and the left, bv collabora-
tionists and the Resistance; both ends of the political spectrum
saw the film as a condemnation of the French people, unpatriotic
from one perspecti\e, giving ammunition to the enemy from the
other. In the postwar period
it was the main target for retribution
against filmmakers who worked during the war. Clouzot and
scriptwriter Louis Cha\ance uere banned from further film work;
Fresnay and another performer were put in jail (after a short
period the bans were quietK
lifted, and Clouzot and Fresnav were

With the passage of time, Le Corbeau emerges more clearls as
an antifascist film.
It uses the same metaphorical discourse as
Albert Camus did in his acclaimed 1947 no\'el La Peste
( The
Plaguet. The town
is described (in English subtitles) as infected,
polluted, suffering an epidemic. But "it can be treated and cured
like anv illness," says the doctor. Le Corbeau had the misfortune
of being made in the war years, rather than after. Like Os.<;es$/one,
it refused the allegory of history, and dared to depict the world
around
it.

TALI AN
N EO
Among filmmakers and critics in many countries, the expe-
rience of World War
II sharpened a desire for a cinema of
seriousness and social purpose. Articulations of goals for a
better postwar woHd, combined with revelations of war's horrors,
seemed to preclude a simple return to the old standard methods
of skillfully producing forgettable entertainment. Wartime min-
gling of documentary and fiction— and the use of hand-held
cameras in the midst of action— held the promise of breaking
with studio-bound artificiality and forging a more direct encounter
with social actuality.
It
is perhaps remarkable, given the con-
straints of commercial filmmaking, that a cinematic practice did
emerge as
if in response to these demands, with far-reaching con-
sequences for world cinema.
It was even more surprising that
it
came from a country defeated in the war, which had made
little
discernible impact on the international film scene for decades
from
Italy,
in the form of a movement known as neorealism.
Italian neorealism has probably been the most debated subject
in the history of film. When did
it begin, when did
it end, what
were its sources, what were its characteristics, was
it new, was
it
realism? The questions have been unending. About the only point
not in dispute concerns
its impact. Hollywood's Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave special awards to Vittorio
De Sica's Sciuscia {Shoeshine, 1946) and Ladri di biciclette
{Bicycle Thieves, 1948), and a nomination in the screen story cat-
egory for Riso amaro {Bitter Rice, 1949), directed by Giuseppe De
Santis. On winning a festival prize for Rashomon (1949), a film set
in the distant past, Japanese director Akira Kurosawa was quoted
as saying, "Of course there's nothing like happiness, so I'm happy.
but
if
1 made something more of present-day Japan, such a film as
Bicycle Thieves, and then received a prize, there would be more
meaning to
it and I'd probably be happier."'
Like everything else concerning neorealism, this remark had to
do with politics as well as art. By the time Kurosawa spoke,
in
1951, neorealism had ended as a movement. Among the causes
of its demise was fierce opposition from postwar Italian govern-
ments, which held that neorealist films were besmirching Italy's
international reputation. A law passed in 1949 strengthening
domestic exhibition of Italian films also imposed government
censorship of scripts, restricted production loans to potentially
controversial films, and provided for the withholding of export
licenses for films that were deemed to have "slandered Italy."
Neorealism was in fact a movement very closely tied to specific
historical circumstances of postwar Italy—the years between the
Liberation and the consolidation of power by the conservative
Christian Democrats, 1945 to 1949. These historical ties were
often obscure to contemporaries in other countries who knew the
films but not the Italian context, and they have been further
obscured by critical propensities to discover universal meanings
for humanity in the films, rather than tie them to distant parochial
concerns. English titles given by United States distributors con-
tributed to this universalization. Roberto Rossellini's Roma citta
aperta (1945) became Open City, losing
its historical reference to
Rome, and Ladri di biciclette became The Bicycle Thief, shifting
meaning from the original title's plural thieves to a single one.
Here we will use literal translations: Rome, Open City and
Bicycle Thieves.
282

Neorealism's roots are many. They trace to French poetic real-
ism, as exemplified by Marcel Game's late 1930s films, and to the
long-take, moving-camera style of Jean Renoir (critic Umberto
Barbaro was in fact describing French realism when he coined the
term neo-realismo in 1943).
In Italian terms, they hark back to tra-
ditions of realism in Italian arts such as nineteenth-century literary
verismo and to the location shooting in Italian silent regional film-
making, as in the Naples street scenes in Assunta Spina (1915).
From this strand of literary realism, Italian writers and filmmakers
were drawn to American hard-boiled novelists of the depression
era like James M. Cain, whose The Postman Always Rings Twice
was the source of Luchino Visconti's Ossessione, often regarded
as the first neorealist film (see Chapter 12). They also link to Italian
fascism's interest in the social propaganda of Soviet silent films.
The fascist roots of neorealism are among
its most controversial
aspects. Of the leading neorealist directors, De Sica was a popular
actor and began his filmmaking career in the fascist period, as did
Rossellini, Visconti, Alberto Lattuada, Giuseppe De Santis, and
others. Were elements of what came to be known as neorealist
style apparent in the work of these or other filmmakers under
fascism?
If neorealism was already an aspect of fascist film
aesthetics, what
is
its status as a response to revelations of war's
horrors or aspirations for a better world?
BEGINNINGS OF
NEOREALISM
War
is always confusing, but the end of World War
II in Italy was
more confusing than most.
In 1943 the Allies invaded frrjm the
south, Mussolini was ousted, his successors negrMiated a surren-
der, and Germany invaded from the north. While Italy became a
battleground for the Allies against the Germans, some Italians
fought the Allies, some the Germans, and some each other. Rome
had been considered an "open city"— that
is, a place of sanctuary
because of its status as a holy city— but in July 1943 the Allies
bombed Rome, the government fled south into Allied-held terri-
tory, and the Germans occupied the city. The Allies entered Rome
in June 1944 and Florence in August, but the Germans held the
north until April 1945, when Allied and Resistance forces liber-
ated the remainder of the country.
Roberto Rossellini
These were the events that Roberto Rossellini (1906-1977) sought
to depict in the films that became the first exemplars of neorealism
—Rome, Open City and Paisa (Paisan, 1946). "Open City and
Paisan were films intended to represent a sort of balance
sl.--^et of
REALISM
It must be said that neorealist style,
like most styles, does not
inherently carry a particular political meaning. The most common
stylistic attribute of neorealist films was location shooting. This
was abetted by a practice of postsynchronized sound— dubbing
of dialogue in the studio— which enabled camera movement and
a more open mise-en-scene. A feature of some films was the use
of nonprofessional actors. But there was more to neorealism than
technique. Andre Bazin, the French critic who was one of neo-
realism's strongest advocates, wrote that "neorealism
is more an
ontological position than an aesthetic one. That
is why the
employment of its technical attributes like a recipe do not neces-
sarily produce
it."' In other words, more than an artistic stance,
neorealism embodied an attitude toward
life.
However much one finds traces of neorealist technique in ear-
lier Italian films,
it was this attitude toward
life that emerged from
the historical circumstances of 1945-49 that
is the hallmark of
neorealist cinema. Neorealism
is a film movement of Liberation
hope and post-Liberation disappointment.
It has thus always
offered an ambiguous legacy for Italian cinema. In other coun-
tries, however, and particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,
neorealism has made a greater impact than any other film move-
ment of the sound era.
It provided a model for a cinematic
practice attempting to represent human experience outside the
conventions of entertainment genres, a commitment to the possi-
bility of rendering social actuality as art.
In retrospect, what
is
astonishing
is that a movement of so few films made over so short
a time should have had such an impact on world cinema over half
a century.
that period of history," Rossellini later wrote, "of those twenty
years of Fascism that ended with the great drama of the war, fruit
of something that had been much stronger than us and had over-
whelmed, crushed, and implicated us. Once the balance sheet
had been drawn up, perhaps we could start with a fresh page."'
Rossellini's balance sheet also included a trip to Bedin to make
Germania, anno zero {Germany, Year Zero, 1947). These three
works make up Rossellini's "war trilogy."
Rossellini may have felt he had more reason to turn the page
than others. During the fascist era, Rossellini had become promi-
nent as a director of military propaganda films combining
documentary and fiction
La nave bianca (The White Ship,
1941
), Una pilota ritorna {A Pilot Returns, 1942), and L'uomo
della croce (The Man on the Cross, 1943). There have been as
many opinions on the moral and aesthetic implications of these
works as there have been critics writing about them, but
it seems
clear that the director attempted a humanistic and realistic
approach, within a fascist framework, not fundamentally different
from his humanistic and realistic efforts in his postwar neorealist
films. One looks to Rossellini's war trilogy not for the righteous
fervor of retribution but for the tragic complexity of the war years.
Going to his execution, the priest Don Pietro in Rome, Open City
says, "Oh,
it's not hard to die well.
It's hard to live well!"''

Not infrequently, film movements that are
controversial or undervalued
in their
home countries find advocates and sym-
pathetic interpreters elsewhere. Emerging
in a fractious period of Italian history,
when ideologues of all political hues
demanded that art adhere to doctrine,
neorealism was a movement that particu-
larly needed such foreign friends.
It found
many,
in the United States, Britain, and
France; among critics, none was more
important than the young French writer
Andre Bazin (1919-1958).
Bazin had begun writing film commen-
tary for student publications around 1943,
during the war and the German occupa-
tion of France. He was already working
on his theories of cinematic realism; these
were imbued with a strong element of
what was known as Christian personal-
ism, which held that humans were free
and could perceive but not fully appre-
hend the "real," which retained
its
mystery. His professional career began
after the war simultaneously with the
advent of Italian neorealism, and he
became
its ardent champion.
"Neorealism served Bazin's theories
perfectly," his American biographer,
Dudley Andrew, has written. "He found
that, in nearly duplicating our everyday
perception, neorealism provides the con-
ditions under which experience can
speak of its own accord, unmediated by
the rhetoric of a filmmaker with a point to
make or a story to tell. By choosing an
aspect of reality and continuing to choose
it, the neorealist concentrates on the
screen what
is diffused in
life, allowing us
to engage a subject in all
its mystery."
Bazin's writings on neorealism have
survived as almost the only contemporary
critiques of the movement that are still
read, decades later. They include "An
Aesthetic of Reality: Cinematic Realism
and the Italian School of the Liberation"
and other essays on Rossellini, De Sica,
la terra trema, Bicycle Thieves, and
Umberto D., originally published mainly
in the French Catholic periodical Espirit
(in English, they are collected in What Is
Cinema^ Vol.
II, selected and translated
by Hugh Gray). Bazin sought to add
Rossellini, De Sica, and Visconti to the
group of filmmakers whom he called cin-
ematic realists, which included, among
directors working at that time, Orson
Welles, William Wyler, and lean Renoir.
"As in the films of Welles and
in spite of
conflicts of style, neorealism tends to give
back to the cinema a sense of the ambi-
guity of reality," he wrote. "The means
used by Rossellini and De Sica are less
spectacular but they are no less deter-
mined to do away with montage and to
transfer to the screen the continuum of
reality."
In 1951 Bazin was one of the founders
of the French film magazine Cahiers du
Cinema, and he became a mentor to
such figures as Francois Truffaut and
Jean-Luc Godard, critics who became
French New Wave filmmakers (see
Chapter 17). His theories of cinematic
realism have been extensively analyzed,
but one should not neglect a remark he
made in a 1949 essay on Bicycle Thieves:
"'Realism' can only occupy in art a
dialectical position— it
is more a reaction
than a truth."

It was this atmosphere Rossellini wanted to convev, and
many of the elements of the film's narrative are based on actual

There are moments of surprising earthy humor in the midst of
critical scenes.
Its centerpieces, however, are the most
documentary-like sequences. Scenes of a German raid on an

with an intricate variety of camera locations that make them
appear authentic "documents" even though there are many more
setups than actuality filmmaking would have allowed. Montage
was perhaps the major element of Rossellini's neorealist style
rather than long takes or a moving camera, but, as Bazin argued
in a wider neorealist context, "the assemblage of the film must
never add anything to the existing reality."^ Where a classical
(or Soviet) montage might
fill
in details or point up meanings,
Rossellini's montage multiplied viewpoints while leaving gaps
unfilled. A striking example
is the shocking scene where the
Germans murder Pina, an unwed (and pregnant) mother.

Director
Roberto Rossellini (seated) during
the filming of Germany, Year Zero
seemed like ancient history. "All must unite against a common
enemy," the boy Marcello proclaims, and the film depicts such
unity between the Catholic priest and Manfredi, a Communist
leader of the Committee for National Liberation, both martyrs in
the struggle to free Italy. But with the defeat of the common
enemy, unity between right and
left seemed to many on both
sides a betrayal of their principles.
It was with distance from the
film's historical specificity, particularly in the United States, that
critics and audiences could find
in
it a universalized humanism,
an abstracted vision of solidarity and muted hope.
PAISAN.
Rossellini's next film, also written with Amidei and
Fellini, opened up his historical canvas to the entire Italian penin-
sula. Paisan consists of six episodes in the war, beginning with the
Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 and moving up chronologically
and geographically through Naples, Rome, Florence, a monastery
in the mountains, and lastly the Po delta. Each episode depicts an
encounter between Italians and Americans. Several of the
episodes, particularly the first three in Sicily, Naples, and Rome,
focus on linguistic and cultural barriers to communication that
can lead to misunderstanding, perhaps also to tragedy. The
Florence and Po delta segments emphasize the partisan phase of
the struggle, and here the tragic elements are more implacable,
more fated. The monastery sequence suggests the possibility of
the serenity of eternal values in a time of struggle and change.
The original
title for Paisan
is a colloquial form of the Italian
word paesano,
literally meaning peasant but signifying country-
man and used as a term of greeting. In
its broader sweep,
its
variety of human types (and
its absence of Rome, Open City's
stock heroes and villains), and
its stark physicality of death,
whether in city or countryside, Paisan
is regarded by some critics
as a more important film than Rome, Open City, though
it has not
earned the earlier film's wide acclaim or
its firm place in film
history.
GERMANY,
YEAR ZERO.
For the final film in his war trilogy,
Rossellini traveled to Berlin. He wanted to examine the values he
regarded as the source of the war's suffering, and to depict
its
at the end of the nearly ten-minute sequence of the apartment-
building raid, with German soldiers (and Italian fascists) looking
for members of the Resistance. The style of the sequence
is almost
observational,
its tone set by long and medium-long shots; a
lesser number of medium shots portray character interaction and
leaven the tension with comic touches. Suddenly, Pina sees that
her lover has been captured, runs to him, and
is shot down. With
no break in the visual style, spectators are unprepared for the bru-
tal turn, and in the rapid action no special shots address our
feelings of mourning or rage.
Anna Magna ni (1908-1973), who portrayed Pina, was a profes-
sional, as was Aldo Fabrizi (1905-1990)
in the role of Don Pietro.
The other performers were nonprofessionals, and their scenes of
everyday domestic
life are highlights of the unpretentious ensem-
ble acting neorealism could evoke. Rossellini wrote the script with
Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini.
Considering the status
it has attained as the first great work of
world cinema after World War
II, Rome, Open City was not
greeted warmly in Italy when
it was released in September 1945.

is not so surprising. Rossellini's "balance sheet" already

consequences for Germans. Germany, Year Zero was very much a
message picture. The published version of the script opens with
both a printed text and a voice-over stating the film's themes,
though both are missing from some prints circulating in the
United States. The text begins: "When an ideology strays from
the eternal laws of morality and of Christian charity, which form
the basis of men's lives,
it must end as criminal madness."*
The film demonstrates how this ideology infects the life of a
boy struggling to survive in the rubble and ruin of postwar Berlin.

brother in hiding because of his war record, and a sister who gets
cigarettes from Allied personnel

is a bewildered figure, a waif in the hard, unforgiving street
life of the defeated city. When his father repeats too often what a
burden he

he were dead, the boy puts poison inio his father's tea and kills
him. Later, after further evidence of the city's corruption and his
own alienation, the boy jumps to his death from a building.
Germany, Year Zero is remarkable for its location footage of
Berlin, but
its narrative seems driven more by
its thesis than by
the concern for humanism Rossellini showed in the two previous
films of the war trilogy.

Vittorio De Sica and Cesare Zavattini
If Rossellini brought neorealism to the forefront of world cinema
in the immediate postwar years, the figure who sustained the
movement and became
its center of controversy was Vittorio De
Sica (1902-1974). A popular actor during the revival of Italian cin-
ema under the fascists in the 1930s, De Sica began directing in
the early 1940s. He collaborated with scriptwriter Cesare
Zavattini (1902-1989) on a notable wartime film,
/ bambini ci
guardano (The Children Are Watching Us, 1942), that began a
long-term working relationship extended through all of De Sica's
neorealist films
Shoeshine, Bicycle Thieves, Miracolo a Milano
{Miracle in Milan, 1950), and Umberto D. (1952). De Sica's
efforts to maintain neorealism
in the face of governmental opposi-
tion after 1949 made him the target of political attacks for the last
two of these films.
SHOESHINE.
Along with Rossellini, who featured children
prominently in Rome, Open City and in the Naples episode of
Paisan, De Sica and Zavattini were concerned about the conse-
quences of fascism and war for young people. Shoeshine focuses
on two boys who earn money shining the shoes of American sol-
diers, get caught delivering stolen goods for an adult gang, and
are sent to a reformatory. With nonprofessional performers and
location shooting, the film has a grimmer and more diffuse quality
than Rossellini's work, and there
is little room for humanistic hope
or uplift. When the boys drop off stolen blankets to a fortune
teller, they ask her to read the cards for them, saying, "We have
futures, too." But hope quickly closes down for them, in an
authoritarian reformatory where the director covertly gives fascist
salutes.
Zavattini's scripts frequently had strong elements of symbolism,
and the symbolic role in Shoeshine is given to a horse, which the
boys purchase with the money they received from delivering the
stolen goods. The horse represents freedom and mobility, and at
the end as one boy kills the other in a rage over accumulated
betrayals and estrangements,
it breaks away and vanishes in night
mists. The role of cinema itself is also ambiguously symbolized by
a scene where a projector
is brought into the reformatory to show
movies. In darkness an escape
is made, the projector catches fire,
and while officials cry, "light,
light," a boy
is trampled to death in
the panic.
BICYCLE THIEVES. Cinema also figures in Bicycle Thieves.
When Antonio, the father in the story, gets a job putting up wall
posters, they turn out to be advertising sheets for American
movies, notably Gilda (1946), showing Rita Hayworth in her dark
gown and long gloves. Hollywood movies flooded into Italy after
the war, not only new films but a backlog of wartime production,
and audiences flocked to these rather than to De Sica's bleak neo-
realist work. Shoeshine had been a critical success in foreign
countries but an economic failure in
Italy; De Sica financed his
next film through acting and scriptwriting, reportedly turning
down Hollywood financing because
it would require casting a
Hollywood star.
Bicycle Thieves was the most important film of De Sica's
career, standing in critical estimation alongside Rome, Open City
as a neorealist achievement.
It draws a far wider social portrait
than Shoeshine, and
its mise-en-scene
is considerably more

cate through camera movement and multiple setups in a scene,
it
touches broadly on Italy's institutions and cultures—the govern-
ment bureaucracy, political parties, the Church, popular beliefs,
neighborhoods, the family, soccer. At
its center
is the grinding
poverty of the family
it portrays, exemplified in the relation
between a father and a son.
While Antonio
is putting up his Rita Hayworth poster, his bicy-
cle
is stolen— a brilliantly structured sequence— and with his son
Bruno he searches for the thief and the bicycle. Both father and
son were played by nonprofessionals (as were nearly all the other
roles in the film). At wit's end, needing a bike so he can keep his
job, Antonio too steals a bicycle, but so clumsily that he
is imme-
diately chased down and caught. Reprimanded rather than

his son into a crowd like the horse into the mists of Shoeshine. A
poignant and despairing work, Bicycle Thieves attracted audi-

fell between
the firing lines of the country's ideological debates—to conserva-
tives
it was impermissible to show society's flaws so brazenly, to
the left
it lacked analysis and a clear agenda for social change.
MIRACLE IN MILAN.
The Symbolic and fable-like quality of
Zavattini's writing came further to the fore in Miracle in Milan,
based on one of the scriptwriter's novels. This strange, delightful
film— often described as Chapiinesque for its comic poignancy
was at once a respite from grim neorealism and a riposte against
De Sica's critics, through satire rather than pathos. The film opens
with a title, "Once Upon a Time," and a view of a cottage out of
a fairy tale, but another shot shows behind the cottage a vista of
smokestacks and modern factories of a very contemporary Milan.
An old woman discovers a foundling in her cabbage patch. She
raises the boy. When she dies he goes into an orphanage, which
eventually sends him out to join the city's unemployed and
homeless. The boy, Toto, helps to build a shantytown and forge a
community of the downtrodden, but when oil
is discovered there
they are threatened by the capitalist who owns the land. Using
the magic powers of a white dove brought to him by the old
lady's ghost, Toto helps the shanty dwellers fly away on street
cleaners' broomsticks.
Though any summary makes the film sound like a neorealist
social treatise (until the ending), the entire work
is full of humor
and wonderment. Alessandro Cicognini (b. 1906), who wrote the
music for all De Sica's neorealist films, contributed a score very
different from the first two, with jazz and comic motifs. By expos-
ing power and authority to comic ridicule. Miracle in Milan
constructs in some ways a more devastating critique than the
realist films. Full of magic and fantasy achieved through a most
nonrealistic special effects cinematography, the film nevertheless
forcefully makes
its message clear: postwar Italy offers no place
and no hope for the poor.
UMBERTO
D. De Sica was not in a Strict sense a "political"
filmmaker, in that his films did not represent party doctrines or
deal with issues within the recognizable terms of partisan debate.
In a way they were apolitical moral indictments, and that made
them appear even more dangerous to politicians who were able
to tolerate far more overtly ideological works. As he became, into
the early 1950s, the last practitioner of neorealism, and the one
most honored internationally, De Sica came under increasing crit-
icism (again, both from right and
left). His and Zavattini's last
neorealist collaboration, Umberto D., was a chamber drama, but
its social critique
is as strong as ever.

The film begins with a moment of political failure: a demon-
stration by elderly men demanding increases in their pensions,
quickly and coldly dispersed by police in jeeps. Thereafter
it
is the
story of Umberto D. (portrayed by Carlo Battisti), an old man who
cannot afford to live on his pension, and his relations with his dis-
dainful landlady, a friendly maid, and his faithful dog Flike. His
trip to the dog pound, where unclaimed animals are destroyed,
is
a not-so-subtle metaphor for his own plight. Similar symbolism,
perhaps, can be found
in his landlady's dispossessing him
because of her impending marriage to a movie theater owner.
Himself dispossessed from Italian cinema— at least from financing
for neorealist projects—De Sica accepted Hollywood backing
from producer David O. Selznick for a co-production starring
American performers Jennifer Jones and Montgomery Clift,
Stazione Termini (Indiscretion of an American Wife, 1953; British
title. Indiscretion).
VARIETIES OF NEOREALISM
The question of film movements has sometimes vexed film histori-
ans, because they are never as tidy as scholarship may make
them seem. Italian neorealism
is perhaps as coherent as any
group of films that have been designated a movement:
it stemmed
from specific historical circumstances, shared personnel and aes-
thetic styles, even had a lasting name in
its own heyday (unlike
Soviet silent cinema of the 1920s, which has yet to be given a
satisfactory label, or Hollywood's post-World War
II film noir,
which got
its name years later,
in another country). Yet to all but
specialists, neorealism
is almost always known primarily through
the works of Rossellini and De Sica. Many other styles and
approaches within the movement can be suggested through a
sampling of films from other directors.
The Bandit
The first postwar film of director Alberto Lattuada (b. 1914),
//
bandito (The Bandit, 1946) was associated with neorealism
through
its focus on Italian soldiers returning from German prison
camps and
its location footage in Turin and the Italian Alps. But
stylistically the film fits more into classical than neorealist norms,
dominated by
its tight close-ups of its star performers, Anna
Magnani (from Rome, Open City) and Amedeo Nazzari
(1907-1979), an Errol Flynn lookalike who was a veteran male
lead from fascist cinema. Indeed
it very strongly foreshadows the
emerging Hollywood film noir of the same period, with
its embit-
tered but fundamentally moral war veteran who falls for a femme
fataie and becomes a criminal. His death
in the mountains after a
police hunt also calls to mind the end of Humphrey Bogart's
character in the Warner Bros, gangster film Higii Sierra (1941,
directed by Raoul Walsh). Other Lattuada contributions to neore-
alism include 5enza pieta {Without Pity, 1948) and
// mulino del
Po
( The Mill on the Po, 1949).
La terra trema
After Ossessione in 1942, Luchino Visconti worked as a theater
director until 1947, when with
initial funding from the Italian
Communist party he went to Sicily to make a documentary on
social conditions in one of Italy's poorest areas. Once there, he
developed an ambitious plan to make a three-part film— one on
fishermen, one on farm workers, one on miners. After spending
seven months in the fishing village of Aci Trezza, the filmmaker

was able to complete only the first of these— a two-hour, forty-
minute film. La terra trema (The Earth Trembles, 1948), which,
however, bears a subtitle, Episodio del mare ("Episode of the
Sea"), suggesting a larger whole.
La terra trema
is neorealist aesthetics without compromise:
it
is
filmed entirely on location and performed exclusively by nonpro-
fessionals, Sicilian fishermen and their families.
It even uses the
local dialect on the soundtrack ("The Italian language
is not in
Sicily the language of the poor," a title reads). A voice-over narra-
tor provides translations and commentary for Italian spectators,
which may at times seem redundant to viewers of the text sub-
titled in English, for whom both dialect and voice-over are
translated.
The film resembles Robert Flaherty's 1934 Man of Aran— an
acted documentary, or documentary fiction, about people wrest-
ing a living from the sea. The difference lies, of course, in politics.
Flaherty's people struggle only with nature, Visconti's with the
ideology and practices of capitalism. His fishermen work for
wholesalers who exploit them. One family, the Valastros, mort-
gage their house to buy a boat and break the chain of economic
subservience, but bad weather destroys the boat and the family
is
ruined. Crudely speaking, the film's message
is that you cannot
fight oppression by individualistic means. Near the end the

and posters for Italian neorealist films.
Very
little has been written on this sub-
ject, but one may suggest reasons for
their presence. Black troops in the United
States armed forces may have been of
particular interest to Italians, whose coun-
try had sought to build a colonial empire
in black East Africa and had waged war
against Ethiopia
in the 1930s. Criticism or
ridicule of American forces may have
been easier to focus on black than on
white soldiers, especially since Italians
were familiar with the way many black
characters had been made to look ridicu-
lous in 1930s Hollywood films.
Conversely, blacks as victims of injustice
may have sparked sympathy from Italians
who also had reason to feel victimized
by the cruelties of war.
After Dots M. Johnson played the black
soldier in the Naples episode of Roberto
Rossellini's Paisan (see fig. 13.3), the prin-
cipal black performer in Italian neorealist
films was the African-American actor
John Kitzmiller (1913-1965), who made
his debut in Vivere in pace (To Live in
Peace, 1947), directed by Luigi Zampa
(1905-1990). He portrays an American
prisoner of war who escapes (with a
white buddy) and
is hidden
in an Italian
village guarded by a single German sol-
dier. One night the black man gets drunk
and breaks out of his hiding place,
encountering the German soldier, also
drunk. The two inebriates embrace and
carouse through the village, declaring
prematurely that the war
is over.
Kitzmiller appeared in at least four
other neorealist films, most notably in
Alberto Lattuada's Senza pieta {Without
Pity, 1948),
in which he plays a black
American soldier, Jerry,
in the postwar
setting of the port city Livorno. After
falling in love with an Italian prostitute,
Jerry becomes enmeshed
in the city's
criminal underworld, as the interracial
couple struggles against injustices from
both Americans and Italians. The woman
is killed and Jerry drives a truck into
the sea.
Kitzmiller had a small role as a jazz
musician
in Federico Fellini's directorial
debut, Luci del varieta {Variety Lights.
1951), co-directed with Lattuada. His last
film performance was as a black
American pilot in a Yugoslav production,
Dolina miru {The Valley of Peace, 1956),
by the Solvenian director France Stiglic (b.
1919).

Bitter Rice
Another filmmaker with a strong commitment to Marxism was
Giuseppe De Santis (b. 1917), who had worked with Visconti on
the screenplay for Ossessione. But he applied his principles with a
considerably different style as a director, particularly in his most
famous film, Riso amaro (Bitter Rice, 19491. On one level an
expose of the exploitation of women hired to plant and harvest
rice in a forty-day growing season, more notoriously

the first postwar Italian sex symbol, Sylvana Mangano

breasted scenes that seem to have disappeared from surviving
prints.
Bitter Rice might have followed an approach closer to La terra
trema, according to film scholar Michael Silverman, but the Italian
Communist party, already underwriting Visconti's films, did not
want to put further funds into film production. De Santis was

approached by producer Dino De Laurentiis, who found bank
financing for the project and placed his wife, the teenage starlet
Mangano,
in the lead role. Mangano made the film an interna-
tional sensation and paved the way for the success of such other
Italian actresses as Cina Lollobrigida (b. 1928) and Sophia Loren
(b. 1934). In later years Mangano became an important character
actress in films of Visconti and Pier Paolo Pasolini. But for Bitter
Rice, her presence not only made possible the financing of the
film,
it shifted the focus from the social issue of women workers
to the torrid but distracting themes of sex, crime, murder, and sui-
cide. Among De Santis's other neorealist works were Caccia
tragica
{ Tragic Hunt, 1948) and Non c'e pace tra gli ulivi (No
Peace under the Olives, 1950).
Story ofa Love Affair
It may seem incongruous to conclude this survey on the varieties
of neorealism with the first fiction feature by Michelangelo Anto-
nioni (b. 1912), a director known for later films in a minimalist
style about bourgeois alienation. But Cronaca di un amore {Story
of a Love Affair, 1950)
is of interest as a work closing a circle
begun with Visconti's Ossessione in 1942. Though set in a Milan
fully recovered from war and supporting a hedonistic bourgeoisie,
the film's narrative closely resembles the plot that Visconti took
from James M. Cain's novel. The Postman Alv\/ays Rings Twice:
lovers from different classes scheme to murder the woman's
husband.
Events are set in motion by the husband hiring a detective to
find out about his wife's past. The investigator learns of a suspi-
cious death
in 1943 involving a love triangle, and the inquiry
ironically brings the wife and her former lover together again.
What seems significant
is the notion of interrogating the past and
the precision with which crucial moments are located in the fas-
cist era. A film about the wealthy rather than the poor. Story of a

Love Affair nevertheless creates a portrait of postwar decadence
and amorality firmly linked
in a continuity with fascism— an
updated form of the desperation and rootlessness Visconti
depicted in 1942.
NEOREALISM'S LEGACY
As neoreaiism came to an end as a film movement in
Italy,
its role
as a force in world cinema was just beginning. When films such
as Bicycle Thieves and Rome, Open City reached countries in
Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they struck aspiring filmmakers as
revelations.
In many countries Hollywood movies dominated the
theaters, while struggling domestic film industries sought to copy
Hollywood genre styles. Neoreaiism provided an alternative
model to Hollywood—you did not need lavish sets or expensive
stars; you could make a film inexpensively with your own coun-
try's landscape and people.
Centra Sperimentale
Shortly after World War
II the film school founded in Rome during
the fascist era, Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, reopened
(as did the studio complex Cinecitta) under new auspices.
Neorealism's influence brought to the school numerous young
filmmakers from other countries. One was Fernando Birri
(b.
1925) from Argentina, who enrolled
in 1950. "For me,"
Birri later
recalled, "the great revelation of the neorealist movement was
that, contrary to Hollywood's tenets and example,
it was possible
to make movies on the same artistic level as a play, a novel, or
a poem."" After working as an assistant to De Sica on a 1956
film,

Birri returned to Argentina, where he

297

founded a film school and made an important feature in a neo
realist style, Los inundados (Flooded Out, 1961
); both school and
film helped to stimulate Latin America's filmmaking revival.
Another who came to Centre Sperimentale was Tomas Gutier-
rez Alea (b. 1928) from Cuba, who enrolled in 1951. Gutierrez
Alea went on to become a leading feature filmmaker after the
1959 Cuban revolution. His best-known work
is Memorias del
subdesarrollo (Memories of Underdevelopment, 1968; see
Chapter 18 for a discussion of this film
in the context of the 1960s
"Cinema of Liberation"). "From the beginning of the revolution,"
Gutierrez Alea has said, "our artistic foundation was in fact essen-
tially Italian neorealism."''
Other Influences
Many filmmakers who came of age after World War
II made testi-
monials to neorealism. In India, Satyajit Ray (1921-1992) found
inspiration in Bicycle Thieves for the films he began making in the
1950s that brought international recognition to his country's cin-
ema. In China after the 1949 revolution. Bitter Rice provided a
model for a cinema combining melodrama and social realism.
"My generation," said Nelson Pereira dos Santos (b. 1928), a key
figure in Brazil's Cinema Novo movement of the 1960s, "was pro-
foundly concerned with the problems of the country
.
.
. and was
searching for a form of political participation
in the sense of
transforming reality. The synthesis (between making films and
discussing national reality) was found
in the model of Italian
neorealism."'"
Italian Cinema
Neorealism's legacy for Italian cinema
is surely more compli-
cated. As postwar Italy entered a period of growing prosperity
amid politics as usual, both the terrors and the ideals of the mid-
1940s seemed increasingly remote. Federico Fellini, who had
worked on the scripts of Rossellini's Rome, Open City and
Paisan, emerged as Italy's most internationally acclaimed director
of the 1950s with a more private, subjective style and themes (see
Chapter 15). Filmmakers of the neorealist era survived sometimes
by making sex comedies featuring Italy's new generation of stars.
The film that seemed most strongly to carry forward neorealist
tenets was Accattone (1961
; the title means "beggar," and
is the
lead character's nickname), directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini
(1922-1975), though Pasolini had not participated in the
neorealist movement and spoke
little about
it. A protean figure,
well-known as a poet, novelist, and essayist, Pasolini wrote
screenplays in the 1950s before directing /Accaffoneas his first
film. A story of street youth who hang out and make money as
pimps, Accattone uses nonprofessionals and location shooting,
but
it conveys a claustrophobia and emptiness different from neo-
realism's militancy or pathos. Pasolini's camera roves the faces of
his subjects in medium and tight close-ups,
less searching for
meaning than simply recording their existence. The film breaks
with realism
in a lengthy dream sequence and
in
its use of reli-
gious motifs, such as Bach's St. Matthew's Passion as
its music.
Past as Flashback
Films dealing with the fascist era went through a popular cycle in
the 1970s, beginning with Bernardo Bertolucci's
// conformista
{The Conformist, 1970), but works that touched on the crucial
events of the mid-1 940s appeared less frequently. Those that did
often opened in a present moment and approached the past
through flashback, as a protagonist's personal memory. This
device was used
in Crista si e fermato a Eboli (Christ Stopped at
Eboli, 1979), directed by Francesco Rosi
(b. 1922), who had
worked as an assistant director on Visconti's La terra trema.
It was
also the strategy of La notte di San Lorenzo (The Night of the
Shooting Stars, 1982), codirected by the Taviani brothers, Paolo
(b. 1931
) and Vittorio(b. 1929).
Though set in the 1930s, like most films depicting the fascist
era, Christ Stopped at Eboli derives
its significance from the book
on which
it was based, a memoir by the writer, painter, and
physician Carlo Levi of his experience in a remote village in
southern
Italy, to which he was banished by the fascist govern-
ment in 1935;
it was published
in 1945, with the same title, and
with Rome, Open City served as one of the first artistic mani-
festos of Liberation. The Night of the Shooting Stars touches on
the partisan struggle, the subject of the Florence and Po delta
episodes of Paisan. Set in August 1944, the film has as
its center-
piece a remarkable sequence of fratricidal warfare, a fight
between partisans and fascists in a field of tall wheat. The
Tavianis favored nonprofessionals and location work in the film as
a kind of homage to neorealism, but they also utilized fantasy
sequences, flashbacks as reverie (within the overall flashback
structure of the work), and other non-realist stylistics.
A film that attempted to encapsulate neorealism's legacy both
for Italy and Italian cinema was C'eravamo tanto amati (We All
Loved Each Other So Much, 1974), directed by Ettore Scola
(b. 1931
).
It too uses flashback structure (while parodying the con-
vention). Opening in the present,
it goes back to a brief scene of
partisan fighting, then traces the lives of three young partisans
over the decades. One becomes a hospital orderly and remains
true to his radical principles. Another becomes a wealthy busi-
nessman; this character
is portrayed by Vittorio Gassman
(b. 1922), the villain of Bitter Rice, and he gets his start through
an obese, corrupt developer played by Aldo Fabrizi, the martyred
priest Don Pietro of Rome, Open City.
The last one becomes a junior professor who loses his job
defending Bicycle Thieves against a conservative colleague who
shouts, "Films like this offend taste, poetry, and beauty.
.
. .Dirty
laundry should be washed at home." The fired professor becomes
an expert on neorealism and scores a success on a 1950s quiz
show, but loses everything when he falters on a question about
the boy Bruno in Bicycle Thieves. When asked, "Why
is the boy's
crying so realistic?" he answers: because the director, De Sica, put
cigarette butts in his pockets. The quiz show host rejects this
behind-the-camera anecdote, explaining that the correct answer
is: because his father
is being beaten for stealing a bicycle. Later
we see actuality footage of De Sica explaining to an audience
that, indeed, they got the boy to cry by putting lighted cigarette
butts in his pockets (the film
is dedicated to De Sica, who died
in
the year
it was released).
In
its somewhat ironic approach to neorealism, the film displays
a nonrealistic style. Characters break the realist frame by making
self-reflexive comments as direct address to the camera/spectator
in the middle of acted scenes. Full-frame shots are partially
blacked out to present a single character's internal thoughts, and
shots shift from black-and-white to color and back again. "Our
generation
is a total failure," one of the characters says near the
end, and while
it does not seem likely that director Scola fully
endorses this verdict,
it
is clear that his tribute to neorealism
is
also a farewell.

FOURTEEN
OLLYWOOD'S
u
I
Historians of Hollywood often regard the
I
United States film industry, with consid-
I
erable justice, as a separate case in
cinema history— different from other
national cinemas by
its size,
its structure, and
its success in global
film domination. Yet by looking at Hollywood in comparative per-
spective,
it
is possible to view what happened there after World
War
II as part of a worldwide system of transformations in both
cinema and society at large. Just as with Italian cinema, for exam-
ple, Hollywood was subjected to decisive governmental
interventions, which responded to, and served to deepen, internal
divisions within the industry itself. Though
it began the postwar
era at the height of its success, the U.S. film industry was within
half a decade beleaguered and defensive, only beginning to grasp
the new challenges with which
it was coping.
The events of the 1946-52 period occurred
in a chronological
order, but their origins and causes stretch back in some cases for
decades, and they are perhaps best seen as a whole. Much of
what happened involved completing unfinished business from the
1930s, postponed but also altered by the war. A good deal also
was linked to emerging trends reshaping entertainment and
leisure activities— ultimately, television replacing movies as pri-
mary deliverer of moving image communication. But
it
is
important to bear in mind that television was not the principal
cause of the movie industry's changes:
it became an important
commercial medium only after Hollywood's struggles were well
under way.
POLITICAL CHALLENGES TO
HOLLYWOOD
Governmental pressures experienced by Hollywood culminated
actions initiated before World War
II. One strand was an antitrust
suit begun by the Justice Department in the 1930s that in 1948
reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where a decision was rendered
against the movie industry. Another was a concern with alleged
communist infiltration of the motion picture industry, which had
aroused the interest of a congressional unit, the House Committee
on Un-American Activities (known as HUAC), before the war, and
led to traumatic public hearings beginning in 1947.
The Paramount Case
The government's antitrust suit was known as "the Paramount
case" as shorthand for its full name, United States
v. Paramount
Pictures,
Inc., et al. Filed in 1938, the suit charged not only
Paramount but also all the other major companies (M-C-M/
Loew's, Warner Bros., RKO, Twentieth Century-Fox) with violating
United States laws against monopoly in restraint of trade. The gov-
ernment argued that the structure of the motion picture industry
that had developed during the studio era—the system of vertical
integration, with large companies controlling production, distribu-
tion, and exhibition (through ownership of large city theaters)
was such a monopoly.
As was usual
in cases such as these, a lower court handed
down a so-called consent decree, in which companies agreed to
scale down offending practices.
In this instance, however, the

The allure of television: a

ters of the National Broadcasting
Company, to watch a live trans-

Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II in

their contempt citations were upheld by higher courts and all ten
served up to a year in prison. The motion picture industry, seeking
to head oft further congressional inquiry into movie content,
agreed that
it would no longer employ communists or alleged
subversives. HUAC hearings resumed in 1951, when witnesses
were required to "name names" of others they knew to be
members of the Communist party, or face banishment from the
industry.
It
is estimated that several hundred writers, performers,
and directors lost their employment through the
"blacklist" that
lasted more than a decade. Many others came under suspicion
(for example, for having joined antifascist organizations in the
1930s to which communists belonged) and to keep their jobs had
to write letter? repudiating their past political beliefs. The conse-
quences for motion picture production are difficult to assess, but
certainly Hollywood could
ill afford to reject so many talented
individuals during a period when
its role in entertainment was
under challenge. Some writers were able to continue working
under pseudonyms or by having others take the credit, but this
was not possible for blacklisted performers or directors. A break-
through against the blacklist came in 1960 when one of the
Hollywood Ten, Dalton Trumbo, received screen credit as
scriptwriter for Spartacus, directed by Stanley Kubrick. In the
STRUGGLES
government regarded the decree as too lenient and appealed to
the Supreme Court.
In
its Paramounf decision, the high court sup-
ported the government and ordered decrees that would require
movie studios to divest themselves of all theater ownership. That
process lasted into the mid-1950s and was a major factor in the
demise of the studio system that had been
in place since the
1920s.
The HUAC Hearings
Simultaneously with the Paramount case came the congressional
probe into alleged communist activities in the motion picture
industn,'. That members of the Communist party worked in
Hollywood was well-known;
it was a legal political party, and the
U.S. alliance with the Soviet Union during World War
II had fos-
tered openness and cooperation. But in a rapidly changing
political climate, with a Cold War escalating between the former
Allies and a domestic backlash under way against New Deal
liberalism, conservatives sought to drive leftists from the commu-
nications industry. The House Un-American Activities Committee
hearings of 1947 called both "friendly" witnesses (these included
studio heads and performers such as Robert Taylor, Gary Cooper,
and Ronald Reagan) and witnesses who did not appear voluntar-
ily, deemed "unfriendly." Among the latter, ten were charged with
contempt of Congress after they refused to answer questions such
as, "Are you now or have vou ever been a member of the
Communist party?"
The so-called Hollywood Ten, mainly screenwriters, argued
that the First Amendment of the Constitution's Bill of Rights pro-
tected the privacy of their political beliefs and affiliations, but
changing atmosphere of the 1960s the blacklist broke down and
was regarded retrospectively as a nightmare of American political
repression, which
left behind blighted careers and ruined lives.
Audience Decline
These events came on the heels of Hollywood's most successful
year in
its history, 1946,
in terms of motion picture attendance.
Audience numbers began to decline after that, affected by popu-
lation shifts to the suburbs, returning veterans concentrating on
jobs and establishing families, and growing interest in outdoor
and participatory leisure activities. Sales of television receivers
and the development of television programming became factors in
the further drop in movie attendance beginning around 1948-49.
Hollywood's attempts to counter these trends began with a grad-
ual increase in color motion pictures (color television was not
substantially available until the 1960s).
It reached a crescendo
around 1953 with the introduction of widescreen (actually, rein-
troduction; see Chapter 8 for earlier widescreen innovations) and
three-dimensional processes. This chapter will focus on the post-
war period through 1952; the new technologies and later
developments will be discussed in Chapter 16.
FILM NOIR
This period of difficulty in the American motion picture industry
nevertheless saw the flourishing of perhaps Hollywood's most
famous film movement
film noir. Distinctive in a dark and
oppressive visual style, and in narratives of desperation and
entrapment that defied Hollywood's conventions of happy end-

What was at stake in United States
v.
Paramount Pictures Inc., et al, the case
that led to the breakup of the vertically
integrated Hollywood studio system?
Clearly
it must have been something
more than the typical suit in which the
U.S. Justice Department charges a com-
pany or an industry with violating laws
against monopoly in restraint of trade, in
most instances the consent decrees by
which these cases are settled are allowed
to lapse after about twenty years; with the
motion picture industry, the consent
decrees that settled the Paramount case
lasted nearly forty years, finally lapsing in
the 1980s when motion picture produc-
tion or distribution companies were again
allowed to hold a financial interest in the-
ater ownership.
Challenges to the vertical integration of
the motion picture industry arose almost
as soon as companies began to pursue
the strategy, around World War
I, of own-
ing production studios, distribution
exchanges, and theaters. This was often
instigated by associations of independent
exhibitors. Though the major studios
owned less than 20 percent of the total
number of theaters, they dominated the
first-run houses in the big cities. The pic-
tures they played in these theaters were
highly publicized and eagerly sought after
by thousands of smaller theaters. As dis-
tributors, however, the major companies
required exhibitors to take "blocks" of
films in order to get the ones they
wanted, and to sign up for them sight-
unseen (these practices were called
"block-booking" and "blind-booking").
During the New Deal era of the 1930s,
debate on motion picture industry
practices shifted to the ground of commu-
nities and culture. A strong strand of
thought in the United States holds that
culture should be community-based;
even
if a community does not produce all
of its own culture, as few have ever done,
this viewpoint contends that "community
values" should determine what cultural
products are exhibited or sold. In the era
of live entertainment, even when a show
was produced elsewhere, communities
could decide whether or not to book the
road company. But motion picture indus-
try practices, especially block- and blind-
booking, were seen from tliis perspective
as eroding community choice. The was
one of the perspectives underlying the
Justice Department's persistence in
opening the Paramount case in 1938, sus-
taining
it through various compromise
efforts until the 1948 decision was
achieved that ordered movie companies
to divest their theater ownership, and
continuing the resulting consent decrees
for nearly four decades.
Ironically, however, motion picture
divestment came at just the time com-
mercial television was starting in the
United States, with even greater potential
for undermining community choice in
media. As so-called "networks" emerged
in television as production-distribution
companies, the Federal Communications
Commission limited their ownership of
individual television stations; later the
networks also were restricted from pro-
ducing some entertainment programs.
In
an era of electronic delivery of cultural
products, the issues of community con-
trol over culture,
still very much alive, are
difficult to define or implement.
ings and good triumphing over evil, film noir has influenced
younger filmmakers for decades, and grown
in critical importance
ever since the movement was named, retrospectively, by two
French critics in their 1955 book entitled Panorama du film noir
americainJ (The name derived from a French series of translations
of American hard-boiled detective and crime novels, called "Serie
Noire," which gave rise to the term roman noir, or dark novel,
hence film noir.)
With
its themes of paranoia and betrayal, of suspicious inno-
cence and attractive guilt, of greed and desire in a world whose
moral signposts have disappeared, film noir might appear a
natural outgrowth of Hollywood's postwar troubles. The film
movement got
its start, however, during World War
II {a period to
which, of course, many of its themes also apply), and
its sources
date back to the 1930s. These varied circumstances have gener-
ated a critical debate about the fundamentals of film noir. Was
it
a genre, was
it a movement, was
it a style? How many films
belong to the film noir canon? A reference book on film noir lists
nearly two hundred titles from 1944 to 1952, with 1950 as the
peak year, and a rapid falloff into the mid-1950s.'
If this seems
perhaps too inclusive, there are viewpoints at the other end of the
spectrum whose definitions are so precise that only a half dozen
or so titles qualify as "true" film noir. Somewhere between these
numerical extremes lies a film movement whose distinctive style
and perspective cropped up in a wide variety of existing genres
gangster, crime, private eye, police procedural, and espionage
films, even women's melodramas, historical costume pictures,
and literary adaptations.
Sources ofFilm Noir
One of the anomalies of film noir in
its historical context was that
so many of its important films were drawn from hard-boiled crime
and detective novels of the 1930s. These holdovers from the
depression era were available in part because Hollywood's self-
regulating body, the Production Code Administration, had at first
refused approval for their film adaptation, then grew more lenient
304

(1905-1986), Phantom Udy hy Robert Siodmak (1900-1973),
Ministry of Fear by Fritz Lang;
in 1945, Detour by Edgar G. Ulmer
(1904-1972) and Lang's The Woman in the Window and Scarlet
Street. These directors brought not only expressionist cinematog-
raphy's odd angles and dark shadows but also a pessimism drawn
from witnessing the rise of fascism
in modern mass societies.
Coincidentally, Wilder, as writer, and Siodmak and Ulmer, as co-
directors, had made their film debut on a 1929 work, Menschen
am Sonntag {People on Sunday), on which Fred Zinnemann (b.
1907), later the director of High Noon (1952), also worked.
POSTWAR ANXIETY.
Along with these prewar and foreign
influences, film noir was shaped by the experience of war's hor-
rors, by the deep-rooted anxieties touched off by the dawn of the
nuclear age, and by the difficult postwar adjustment faced by vet-
erans. Moreover, after the HUAC hearings progressive filmmakers
learned to couch their social critiques within familiar genre frame-
works, which may help to account for the surge of noir films
around 1950, just before many of the progressives were driven
from the industry. Not all film noir works were concerned with
criticizing society, to be sure, but in most of them something was
amiss; the individual was out of step with social order and
doomed to pay the consequences.

rama du film noir americain cite as the beginning of film noir The
Maltese Falcon (1941
), directed by John Huston and based on the
1930 novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett. Others
regard the emergence of film noir as dating from two 1944 films,
Double Indemnity, directed by Billy Wilder, and Murder, My
Sweet, directed by Edward Dmytryk; the former was adapted from
the 1936 novel of the same name by James M. Cain, the latter
from the 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler.
Chandler cowrote the script for Double Indemnity with director
Wilder.
GERMAN EMIGRES.
Another source for film noir was
German cinema of the Weimar era, with
its dark psychological
moods and eerie visual effects associated with expressionism.
Many of the key early works of the film noir movement were
directed by German (or Austrian) emigres: in 1944, Double
Indemnity by Wilder (b. 1906), Laura by Otto Preminger
Film Noir Style
Film noir has been defined in terms both of narrative and of visual
style.
Its most common narrative element involves a male protag-
onist's fascination with an alluring, dangerous woman, which
leads him away from certainty and order into a world of lawless-
ness and guilt. Formally, these stories were often told as
flashbacks, with action
in the present alternating with or framing
past events, as the protagonist searches for his lost identity, for the
place where things went wrong. These narratives of psychological
distress and social disruption were also shaped by the films' visual
style. Film noir emphasized dark and claustrophobic framing,
with key lighting from sources within the mise-en-scene casting
strong shadows that both conceal and project characters' feelings.
This visual style marked a sharp break with the brightly lighted
and carefully balanced look of Hollywood films of the 1930s.

J oilywood on
I rial
The anticommunist crusade in the United
States after World War
II
is widely known
by the name McCarthyism, after Senator
Joseph R. McCarthy (1908-1957),
Republican of Wisconsin, who emerged
in 1950 as a leader of the hunt for alleged
subversives. A standard dictionary defines
McCarthyism as follows: "public accusa-
tion of disloyalty to one's country, esp.
through pro-Communist activity,
in many
instances unsupported by proof or based
on slight, doubtful, or irrelevant
evidence."
McCarthy's Senate committee was
not involved in the investigation of
Hollywood, which was centered
in
the House Un-American Activities
Committee (HUACl. Besides
its concern
with movies, HUAC also focused on labor
unions and other organizations that mem-
bers of the Communist party had joined
in the 1930s and the war years. But the
motion picture industry and the commu-
nications field more generally were
special targets of the investigators, who
were supported by conservative interests
opposed to what they regarded as
left-
wing bias in the media.
Concerned that HUAC was going to
make a direct assault on motion picture
content, directors John Huston and
William Wyler and writer Philip Dunne
took the lead in forming the Committee
for the First Amendment, composed of
Hollywood figures committed to defend-
ing filmmakers' artistic freedom. (HUAC
did begin to probe movie content, but
quickly dropped this subject in favor of
concentrating on the political beliefs of
individuals). Many of its members flew to
Washington to be present when Eric
Johnston, head of the producers associa-
tion, was scheduled to testify, but HUAC
crossed them up, calling instead the first
of the "unfriendly" witnesses. The First
Amendment group lost
its zeal as mem-
bers did not want to be branded as,
in the
language of the era, "fellow-travelers" of
the left. Ten "unfriendly" witnesses
refused to answer questions about their
political affiliations and were cited for
contempt of Congress.

Women in Film Noir
A significant trend
in recent criticism has been to explore the rep-
resentation of women
in film noir. The roster of beautiful women
who lure or impel men to transgression
is a long one:
it includes
performances by Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, Joan
Bennett in The Woman in the Window and Scarlet Street, Jane
Greer in Out of the Past {^947, directed by Jacques Tourneur), and
Rita Hayworth in The Lady from Shanghai (1948, directed by
Orson Welles). Hayworth's famous performance in Gilda (1946,
directed by Charles Vidor),
in which she sings the sultry song "Put
the Blame on Mame" while peeling off her long black gloves, has
come to epitomize the femme fatale of film noir, though, curi-
ously, Hayworth's character does not play that role in the film's
narrative. Crudely put, while exciting the spectator this figure also
warned against— and suffered—the dire consequences of sexual
freedom and desire.
One distinctive mark of film noir
is how well many of its works
have stood the test of time. Their mordant approach
is sometimes
despairing, but more often
it leads to a sharpened energy and
surprise in visual technique and performance. For performers
especially, film noir was a tonic. Barbara Stanwyck (1907-1990),
Fred MacMurray (1908-1990), and Edward C. Robinson all used
Double Indemnity lo forge new screen personas. Dick Powell
(1904-1963) shifted from a singing juvenile to a tough guy private
eye in Murder, My Sweet. Dropped by M-G-M, Joan Crawford
signed with Warner Bros, and won the Best Actress Oscar for her
performance in Mildred P/erce (1945, directed by Michael
Curtiz).

Narrative Innovations in Film Noir
Film noir also innovated in narrative techniques. Double Indem-
nity is marked by two temporal movements; of "real" time and
remembered time. The film opens with Walter Neff (MacMurray)
arriving at his office in the middle of the night and delivering into
a dictating machine his confession for killing a man— "for
money" (pause) "and for a woman." These words trigger a flash-
back that is occasionally narrated by his voice-over confession.
Gradually the narrative brings "real" time and memory together,
while the unusual juxtaposition of temporalities gives the specta-
tor a premonition of what will occur/has occurred in the
flashback story. Finally, they meet as Neff is about to die from the
gunshot wound he suffered at the end of his flashback.
In Scarlet Street, another tale of allurement and murder— and a
remake of Jean Renoir's 1931
French film La Chienne—the nov-
elty (under Production Code rules)
is that the murderer gets away
with
it, while another man dies in the electric chair for the crime.
Because of this apparent breach of the Code, the city of Atlanta,
Georgia, tried to stop the film from screening there. In an affidavit
supporting the film, Joseph
I. Breen of the Production Code
Administration wrote,
"It was our contention and belief that in this
particular motion picture, the murderer was adequately punished
by a higher power, working through his own conscience, which
drove him to become a social outcast and a hopeless derelict.
"*
In Detour, the male protagonist's voice-over persistently
addresses an impersonal "you"— giving the spectator the impres-
sion that he or she
is the person spoken to— and assumes that the
listener
is smug, unsympathetic, and unbelieving. A B picture.
produced by one of Hollywood's small companies, that has
become a film noir classic. Detour is significant in part because
its genre traits shine through so strongly, unmediated by the pres-
ence of familiar stars. The man feels passive, controlled by fate
and women's ambitions. His crimes are committed "accidentally"
but out of deep anger and resentment.
Voice-over and flashback were persistent stylistic and narrative
elements of film noir. While Double Indemnity carefully clues the
spectator to who
is speaking, when, and from where, other films
use voice-over and flashback temporality more ambiguously.
Often we need to inquire about the motives of narrative voices,
how much they know and whether they are telling the truth,
when and to whom they are speaking.
If the dominant Hollywood
style provided all the information spectators would need to follow
the narrative, film noir seems to emphasize narrative gaps, and
even the possibility of narratives that can deceive. Invisible
Storytellers, a study of voice-over narration by Sarah Kozloff,
shows that its occurrence in Hollywood films
is closely linked to

Indemnity and Detour, voice-over
is a key narrative aspect of
Mildred Pierce, Cilda, The Lady from Shanghai, and Out of the

others.
The enduring critical question
is how useful
it
is to apply the
film noir label broadly to films of the postwar era. Mildred Pierce,
for example, clearly demonstrates elements of film noir in
its nar-
rative structure (such as
its use of the flashback) and parts of its

INDEPENDENT PRODUCTION
Though
it broke with stylistic norms, the film noir movomcnt Wiis
still very much a product of the system. With few exce(3tions, film
noir works came out of the studio production prcjcess. A signifi-
cant aspect of the postwar era, however, was a desire on the part
of filmmakers to break not only with old norms but with the sys-
tem
itself: to set up as independent producers of their own work.
Director Frank Capra delivered the most prominent public state-
ment of this wish
in an article, "Breaking Hollywood's 'Pattern of
Sameness,'" published
in the New York Times in May 1946. "A
change
is in the making in Hollywood,"
it began, and Capra
forecast that independent production would bring quality and
individuality to American movies.^ There had of course always
been independent producers in Hollywood, distributing their films

visual style, but these aspects should not obscure the work's
important status as a women's melodrama, where the issues of
female representation are considerably different from film noir's
typical concerns with male protagonists lured by temmes fatale.
It
is even more dubious to count such films as Howard Hawks's The
Big Sleep (1946) or )ohn Huston's The Asphalt Jungle (1950) as
film noir
if such designation deflects attention from these works as
part of their primary genres, respectively private eye and crime.
The same holds true for another postwar classic from a small
company, Cun Crazy (1950), directed by Joseph H. Lewis (b.
1900). This film about an adventure-seeking couple who launch a
crime spree contains few film noir aspects, but
it
is revealing to
see from Production Code records how the code enforcement
agency pushed the work in a film noir direction by proposing
changes that would make the man more of an "unwilling victim"
of the woman's "desire for wealth, no matter how this

The exemplary case was Capra's own endeavor. With directors
William Wyler and George Stevens, Capra set up a production
company, Liberty Films, with a distribution deal with RKO. All
three,
it should be noted, had done wartime documentary or
propaganda work for the government, and their experience
undoubtedly contributed to their ambitions. But Wyler had
commitments to other producers he had to fulfill, and Stevens
continued in military service. So
it was up to Capra alone to
make the first step toward independence.
through United Artists or occasionally through a major studio (as
Capra had done with Meet John Doe in 1941
), but after the war
the desire to become independent was widespread. John Ford,
Howard Hawks, and Fritz Lang were among many directors
involved in independent companies; performers such as Hum-
phrey Bogart set up their own independent ventures.
Independence did not produce the results Capra was looking
for. There were economic reasons for bigness (and possibly also
for sameness). The studios spread their overhead costs over many
films; successes balanced out failures. Independents had too
many eggs in one basket. Production delays or budget overruns
could be financially disastrous;
if audiences did not respond to
their work, there was no cushion to fall back on. Though
it was
itself to become the norm within a few years, replacing the old
studio system mode of production, independent production got
off to a rocky start in the immediate postwar years, with more
defeats than triumphs.

it's a WONDERFUL
LIFE. The film he made was
/f's a
Wonderful Life (1946), which drew on his award-winning prewar
films such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) and Mr. Smith Coes
to Washington (1939) as well as his war work.
It told a story of
one of his typical figures, an uncommon common man, George
Bailey, portrayed by James Stewart. Forced to give up his ambi-
tions to travel by the necessity of taking over the family business
(a savings and loan association), he remains at home while his
younger brother becomes a war hero; then the business itself is
threatened by a cruel and unscrupulous competitor. George
attempts suicide but
is saved by a guardian angel, who responds
to George's cry,
"I wish
I had never been born," by showing him
how his community and loved ones would have fared
if he had
not existed. George realizes that
it
is better to have lived, and the
angel tells him, "You've had a wonderful
life." He returns home
on Christmas Eve and finds that his neighbors have chipped in to
save his business.
It's a Wonderful Life was an honored film of 1946 and has
grown
in stature over the years to become a perennial favorite of
the Christmas season. But
its mood of defeat and desperation was
perhaps stronger than the director realized, and audiences did not
respond in sufficient numbers to ensure the future of Liberty
312

Films. In 1948 Capra persuaded his associates to sell the com-
pany's assets to a studio. The failure of Liberty Films was a blow
to Capra's career from which he did not fully recover.
The Best Years of Our Lives
Wyler did not get to make a film for the Liberty venture, but his
first postwar film, The Best Years of Our Lives, made for Samuel
Goldwyn, beat out
It's a Wonderful Life for 1946 honors.
It won
Academy Awards for best picture, director, actor (Fredric March),
supporting actor (Harold Russell), screenplay (Robert E. Sher-
wood), editing (Daniel Mandell), and music (Hugo Friedhofer).
The Best Years was the film Capra's was not (though Capra had
deliberately declined to attempt such a work): an epic statement,
nearly three hours long, on the transition from war to peacetime.
The Best Years
is the story of three men returning from war to
the same hometown. They represent three different branches of
service and three social classes. One of the three was portrayed
by a nonprofessional, Harold Russell, who had lost both hands in
the war and was fitted with prosthetic devices. In addition to his
supporting actor Oscar, he was given a special award for
"bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans" through his
appearance in the film. The narrative centers primarily on the

than three decades as the world's most popular comic actor,
Chaplin had begun to come under attack
in the United States for
his offscreen activities. He had been convicted in a paternity suit
and tried on other morals charges (his biographers consider accu-
sations against him
in both cases to have been false). Meanwhile,
his progressive political views had fallen out of step with the Cold
War turn toward anticommunism.
Chaplin played into his critics' hands with Monsieur Verdoux
(1947), his first film since The Great Dictator. No longer the Little
Tramp and only ambiguously a comic figure, Chaplin's character
seemed to confirm (in a confusion of art and
life) both the moral
and political charges against the actor. He played a man who
murders women for profit and defends himself by saying that his
business was no different from war, which was also murder for
profit. The majority of reviewers and most of the public rejected
the film. He went to work on Limelight (1952), an homage to the

The film was perhaps the most complete expression
in
Hollywood filmmaking of cinematic "realism" as expounded by
Andre Bazin. Photographed by Gregg Toland, the cinematogra-
pher on Citizen Kane,
it strongly favors the style identified with
jean Renoir's work in France, using long takes, a moving camera,
and deep focus, with objects and people photographed
in rela-
tion to each other in different planes of depth within the frame. As
the film noir movement and
It's a Wonderful Life have grown
in
critical estimation, however. The Best Years has not fared as well.
It
is perhaps an overly composed film, too carefully planned so as
to look "natural," as compared to Renoir's fluid and supple mise-
en-scene or the discomposed and artificial worlds of the films
from this period that have endured.
Charles Chaplin
The independent producer with the greatest longevity entering the
postwar era was Charles Chaplin, whose independent company
dated to the founding of United Artists in 1919. But after more
music-hall-comedy tradition, which also featured the silent com-
edy star Buster Keaton.
In 1952, before Limelight was released,
Chaplin sailed for England, and the United States government
rescinded his reentry permit (he remained a British subject) on the
grounds that he was suspected of being an undesirable alien.
Chaplin did not return to the United States for twenty years, until
long after the anticommunist hysteria of the postwar era had
ended.
In 1972 he was given a special Academy Award "for the
incalculable effect he has had
in making motion pictures the art
form of the century."
My Son John
In the political atmosphere in which Chaplin was barred from the
United States, politicians sometimes chided the Hollywood stu-
dios for their failure to produce anticommunist films.
In response,
the studios turned out a few such works, but many were B pic-
tures and most failed at the box office. Typical was an RKO film

The Western
The most influential Western of the early postwar years was Red
/?/Ver(1948), directed by Howard Hawks as an independent pro-
duction. Although Hawks's name
is often associated with the
Western genre, this was the veteran director's first Western after
more than twenty years in Hollywood. On one level an epic tale
of a historical cattle drive, the film's deeper resonance derived
from the performances of John Wayne (1907-1979) as an auto-
cratic Texas rancher and Montgomery Clift (1920-1966) as an
orphan who becomes virtually the older man's son. Their charac-
ters' struggle over leadership involves issues of masculinity and
male love. The film set the tone for the "psychological Western"
that was to become an important phase of the genre in the 1950s.
Red River also was significant, according to Hollywood legend,
because
it persuaded director John Ford that John Wayne could

screwball comedies in the 1930s. Product of a harsh, religious
father and a weak mother, John becomes a communist spv, but
his mother discovers his secret and finds the will to turn him
in.
GENRE REVIVALS
In troubled times, the Hollywood studios turned to traditional
genres. The postwar years saw a revival especially of Westerns
and musicals, which had been partly eclipsed during the war.
These genres put on display what the movie industry saw as its
trump cards over small-screen television: spectacular visual
effects and sumptuous production values in costumes, decor, and
color cinematography. And for filmmakers who feared to address
social concerns directly in an era of political repression, genres
such as the Western offered the opportunity to raise significant
themes within the safer framework of conventional narratives.
act. This anecdote,
like so many others, may not have been true
but held a kernel of meaning: Wayne surely could act, but prior to
Hawks's film, characterizations had not been developed for him
that could draw out and expand his talent. Ford, whose career as
a director of Westerns dated back to 1917, and who had worked
with the actor in the prewar classic Stagecoach (1939), now
crafted new roles for Wavne that helped to forge his status as an
American icon.
These were in Ford's United States cavalrx trilogy
Fort Apache
(1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), and Rio Grande
(1950). The chronology
is a
little tricky here, in terms of the leg-
end, because Fort Apache was released before Red River, but
Hawks's film had been delayed, and Ford had seen Wayne's per-
formance in the editing room before embarking on Fort Apache.
Of the three. She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, a color film,
is the most
important for Wavne's screen persona, with his elegiac portrait of

an aging army officer. Thematically, Fort Ap.iche is more
ambitious, with Wayne playing a subordinate to an arrogant,
insensitive senior officer (portrayed by Henry Fonda) who leads
his troops into a massacre by Indians modeled on (duster's defeat
at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Wayne's character survives and
allows the press to paint the dead officer as a legendary hero. This
introduced a new element of complexity into the Western genre:
simultaneously debunking the myths of United States westward
expansion while suggesting that their preservation was necessary
for national morale.
The development of Westerns as allegory— figurative treatment
of one subject under the guise of another— was well advanced by
the time of High Noon (1952), directed by Fred Zinnemann. Star-
ring Gary Cooper (1901-1961) as a lawman who goes in ninety
minutes from his wedding to a lonely showdown with vengeful
criminals, the film was conceived by scriptwriter Carl Foreman
(1914-1984) as a lesson
in civics. The unwillingness of townspeo-
ple to help the lawman marked a community's failure to support
authority and stand up to outside threats. This theme could be
seen as applying to the Cold War, or, because Foreman was
called to testify before HUAC, as an indictment of Hollywood's
capitulation before the congressional investigators. The film's suc-
cess, however, was due not to these figurative meanings but to
its
taut drama;
it
is one of the rare films in which narrative time and
the film's duration are almost simultaneous.
316

The Musical
The postwar musical can almost be encapsulated in one name:
Arthur Freed (1894-1973). Freed was a lyricist who became head
of the musical production unit at M-C-M, and
it was from that
studio's Freed Unit that most of the postwar era's classic musicals
emerged. Between 1946 and 1952 the Freed Unit produced eigh-
teen musicals, highlighted by The Pirate (1948) and An American
in Par/s (1951
), both directed by Vincente Minnelli (1903-19861,
and Singin' in the Rain (1952), codirected by Gene Kelly (b. 1912)
and Stanley Donen (b. 1924). Key performers in the Freed musi-
cals included Judy Garland (1922-1969), Fred Astaire, and Kelly.
All the Freed musicals were shot in Technicolor, with bright, rich,
saturated hues.

musical—Gene Kelly as Don

"Singin' in the Rain" number of
Singin' in the Rain (1952),
directed by Kelly and
Stanley Donen.
Minnelli was one of the most significant directors in the genre's
history,
in part because he was not solely a musical specialist.
Amid his postwar musicals he also directed several dramatic
films, and in the 1950s he became an important director of melo-
dramas. This experience added a depth of characterization to his
musicals that was not always apparent in other works in the
genre, along with an undercurrent of interest in the meaning and
value of performance itself.
In The Pirate, for example, when Judy
Garland's character discovers that she can be a performer, she
also learns that
it
is through performance that she can express her
deepest feelings.
Kelly and Donen's Singin' in the Rain, however,
is probably the
most famous of all Hollywood musicals ever made— for Kelly's
performance of the title song,
if for nothing else. A satire on the
film industry during the transition to sound, the film expressed a
nostalgia and an attitude of self-reassurance—we came through
that crisis, so we can get through the crisis now.

Hollywood on Hollywood
Singin' in the Rain belongs not only to the musical genre but also
to the genre of Hollywood films about itself. These works were
often self-promotional and self-congratulatory, but among those
that came out in the wake of Hollywood's postwar difficulties
were films dark and despairing enough to be listed as part of the
film noir movement.
Leader in the mordant revisionism of Hollywood was director
Billy Wilder. In Sunset Boulevard (^950) he carried the film noir
style of narrative voice-over to audacious extremes: his narrator
is
a dead man, who begins his flashback story as we see his body
floating in a swimming pool. The film tells of a former silent
screen star. Norma Desmond (portrayed by former silent screen
star Gloria Swanson), who attempts a comeback by enlisting
and ensnaring—the soon-to-be-deceased narrator, a screenwriter
played by William Holden. Performing as Desmond's chauffeur
(and,
in the narrative, her former director and husband) was Erich
von Stroheim, who /lac/ directed Swanson in the ill-fated Queen
Kelly. "We had faces then," Norma Desmond says, and
"I am big.
It's the pictures that got small."
Some in the film community viewed Sunset Boulevard as an
attack on the industry at a moment when
it was most vulnerable.
As legend has
it, M-C-M head Louis B. Mayer shouted at the
director at a preview, "You have disgraced the industry that made
you and fed you."* But
it was also immediately recognized as a
classic, for
its probing insights on ambition, aging, stardom and
its loss, and, not least, the slippage of Hollywood's legendary
aura at midcentury. Sunset Boulevard was as much an elegy for a
lost Hollywood as She Wore a Yellov^ Ribbon was for the old
West. When tempers cooled,
it was nominated for eleven
Academy Awards, including Best Picture and director, and won
three, for story/screenplay, art direction/set decoration, and music
score.
In his next film, Ace in the Hole (also known as The Big
Carnival, 1951
), Wilder widened the scope of his media critique
to include newspapers, radio, and television. A washed-up
Eastern reporter, played by Kirk Douglas (b. 1916), working in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, happens upon a man trapped in a
cave. He seizes on the chance to restore his career by dramatizing
the incident— and prolonging the rescue effort for maximum pub-
licity exposure. Along with the press, hordes of spectators come
to the cave site, where games and rides spring up in a carnival
atmosphere. There are several shots of trucks marked "The Great
American S & M Corp.," a clear sign of Wilder's views (he was
also producer and coscriptwriter) on the sadism and masochism
involved in media-generated spectacle. The trapped man loses
hope and dies, and the crowd vanishes; belatedly appalled by
what he has wrought, the reporter
is stabbed in a struggle and
also dies. Cynical
is a term often used to describe Wilder's films,
though
it seems a
little imprecise; pessimistic and without
illusions are closer to the mark.

(1950), with Gloria Grahame as

In the Hollywood-on-Hollywood genre, sadism, masochism,
and pessimism seemed distressingly to rule. Another dark work
touching on the movie industry (and one that
is also often listed
as a film noir) was In a Lonely Place (1950), directed by Nicholas
Ray (1911-1979). Humphrey Bogart (1899-1957), whose indepen-
dent company produced the film, plays an out-of-work screen-
writer suspected of a murder.
It turns out he
is innocent of crimes
(a last-minute script change during production), but his violent
tendencies and delight in describing murder— from an artistic
perspective— are unsettling to both screen characters and specta-
tors. Hollywood
is more the milieu than the subject of this work,
but by implication
it calls into question movie violence and the
glorification of screen figures (such as Bogart had become) who
use violence acceptably as tough guy heroes.
Minnelli took time out from musicals to direct an important
film about Hollywood, The Bad and the Beautiful {}952). Kirk
Douglas again plays a sadist, a movie producer who abuses cre-
ative talent— in the film, a director, a star, and a writer— in order
to get them to produce their best work. Hating him, but owing
their success to him, the three creative figures are ready to be
beguiled into another project by the producer's imagination and
energy. This was a barely hopeful ending. Hollywood's confi-
dence appeared to be so battered by the onslaught of political,
judicial, and economic challenges that the Hollywood-on-
Hollywood genre seemed more capable of providing ammunition
for the industry's critics than of shoring up
its myths.

FIFTEEN
RTCINEMA
AND
If Hollywood was having troubles after World War
II, the rest of
the world was hardly aware of
it. American films from as far back
as the late 1930s poured into European and Asian countries which
had cut off imports from the United States before the war.
Moreover, two of the strongest prewar film industries—those of
Germany and )apan—were in the control of military occupation
forces: of the United States in Japan, and of four Allied nations in
Germany. Germany's film industry was further weakened as the
Cold War developed and filmmaking in the Soviet zone (where
the Ufa studio complex was located) split off from production in
the French,
British, and American zones. Under these circum-
stances, the powerful currents of nationalism that had shaped
cinema culture before the war began to abate. They were chal-
lenged by a growing conception of a cinema without borders: that
film was an international medium thriving not
in response to the
demands of national governments but through the artistic skills
and aspirations of individuals.
The post-World War
II era saw a revival of the idea of film as
art,
in opposition to widespread utilization of film for propaganda
purposes during the 1930s and the war years. A common term
was art cinema.
Its definition was broad and general; mostly
it
marked a differentiation from the cinema of crass commercialism.
The concept was distinct from "artist's cinema," which implied a
relation to the avant-garde, and from the later notion of the film-
maker as "auteur" (author), which found such figures working in
the Hollywood studio system. Art cinema consisted of narrative
fiction films whose directors brought seriousness of purpose and
a taste for stylistic innovation to their work.
Art cinema was fostered at film festivals, which began to play a
significant role in the postwar years as gathering places for the
international film community and showcases for new work from
many countries. Their prizes helped little-known filmmakers gain
the attention of critics and access to a small but growing world
market for aesthetically challenging films. The Venice Film Festival
in
Italy was the oldest such event, having been founded
in 1932 as
part of Fascism's revival of Italian cinema;
it was canceled from
1943 to 1945 and resumed in 1946. The Cannes Film Festival
in
France began
in 1946 and became important not only for the
competitive prizes
it awarded but as a marketplace for film
financing and distribution deals.
INTERNATIONAL CINEMA
The international character of art cinema was shaped by the min-
gling of filmmakers, performers, producers, and distributors at film
festivals. While a considerable share of film production continued

the pattern of national cinema, to be sure, there were also a num-
ber of circumstances that encouraged international cooperation or
co-production. Distributors frequently held foreign currencies that
could not be exchanged and could only be used in the country of
origin; by assembling an international cast and crew a producer
could often gain financial backing from a number of countries.
The Third Alan
An example of this emerging trend was the film that won the
grand prize at Cannes in 1949, The Third Man (1949). This thriller
was nominally a British film, with direction by Carol Reed (1906-
1976), an original screenplay by novelist Graham Greene, and
primary production responsibility from Alexander Korda at his
London Films-British Lion company. But
it was photographed in
Vienna, Austria; Hollywood's David O. Selznick purchased
United States distribution rights and participated
in the produc-
tion; and the international cast included Americans Orson Welles
and Joseph Gotten (b. 1905) and the Italian actress Alida Valli
(b. 1921
), who had been under contract to Selznick. The film's
visual style was variously compared to Italian neorealism, German
expressionism, and American film noir. Perhaps
its biggest selling
point was
its music score, written and played on a zither by
Anton Karas, which became a European hit song. "The Third Man
theme" remains recognizable decades after the film's release,
and, as Selznick said, "put The Third Man into the language"
as a term relating to Cold War espionage.'
The film's themes were also international.
Its male protagonists
are both Americans, Gotten as Holly Martins, a naive writer of
Western stories, and Welles as Harry Lime, a shadowy dealer in
black-market drugs. They carry forward traditional types of the
innocent American and the Ugly American into the web of Gold
War intrigue. The ever intrusive Selznick was deeply concerned
about another American type, the Ignorant Spectator. He got the
filmmakers to add a prologue explaining the four-power occupa-
tion of Vienna, and to make "the Russians the heavies,
in pursuit
of the girl."^
The Return ofBiimiel
A filmmaker who benefited from a festival prize was Luis Bunuel.
The Surrealist director of the avant-garde Un Chien andalou and
the caustic documentary Las h-lurdes {Land without Bread) had
fallen out of the world's sight for some time. He had aided the los-
ing Republican side in the Spanish Civil War and worked at The
Museum of Modern Art in New York editing Nazi documentaries
for United States distribution, but he was fired from that job when
accused of communist sympathies. Basically, he had not directed
323

a film in fifteen years when he went to Mexico in 1947 and
resumed his directing career. He made more than twenty films in
Mexico over the next two decades before returning permanently
to Europe. His third Mexican film, Los Olvidados (literally "The
Forgotten," originally released in the United States as The Young
and the Damned, 1950), won him a director's prize at Cannes,
restored him to international prominence, and brought Mexican
cinema onto the world stage.
As a film about impoverished street kids, with a strong social
message, Los Olvidados inevitably invites comparison with De
Sica's Shoeshine. But Bunuel was a critic of neorealism. "Neo-
realist reality
is incomplete, conventional, and above all rational,"
he said. "The poetry, the mystery,
all that completes and enlarges
tangible reality,
is utterly lacking."^ (He did praise Bicycle Thieves
and screenwriter Zavattini.) Los Olvidados presents the "real"
in
the form of Surrealism rather than neorealism. "The cinema,"
Bunuel said, "seems to have been invented to express the
life of
the subconscious
Yet
it
is almost never used to do this."^ Mixed
with scenes of abject poverty and cruelty are dreams, surreal
visions, states of consciousness, and a rare (for the era) breaking
of the illusion of cinematic "reality"— a boy throws an egg at the
camera lens, where
it shatters and drips. A film of midcentury,
Los Olvidados unites in a single text the end of the postwar
desire for a social cinema and the emergence in the 1950s of
an art cinema.

Japan's entry into the mainstream of world cinema after World
War
II seems,
in retrospect, even more remarkable than
it may
have appeared at the time. As we have seen, Japan before the war
maintained a film industry second
in size and strength only to the
United States, and in such filmmakers as Kenji Mizoguchi and
Yasujiro Ozu had produced masters of the medium. But their films
were rarely seen outside Japan or Japanese-controlled territories,
and in Europe and North America
it was a cinema barely known
even to specialists. Japan had been defeated in the war, Tokyo
and other cities had been nearly destroyed, and the United States
occupation administration was determined to root out what
it
considered Japan's authoritarian value system and replace
it with
American-style democracy.
Perhaps fortunately, Americans had a healthy respect for the
power of movies. The occupation fostered restoration of the
Japanese film industry.
Its censorship policies forbade "period"
films on the grounds that they reinforced "feudal" values, but as
the Cold War took shape the United States sought to utilize
Japan's strengths rather than totally transform them, and the
Japanese film industry was functioning more or less without con-
straint before the occupation ended in 1952. Japanese social
theorists continue to debate whether the occupation had a posi-
tive or negative impact on Japanese culture (in the realm of
cinema, for example, Japanese filmmakers found American
restrictions less onerous than eadier Japanese censors). As a fur-
ther point of comparison in film culture, postwar German cinema
did not begin to make a mark internationallv until the late 1960s.
Film festivals propelled Japanese cinema toward world recogni-
tion. Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) won the grand prize at
Venice in 1951
(as well as Hollywood's Academv Award for best
foreign-language film), and the director won another award for

British filmmakers seemed poised to play
a significant role in the post-World War
II
emergence of an international art cinema.
Wartime production of morale-building
patriotic fiction films had boosted audi-
ences for domestic features and estab-
lished a group of talented directors,
including Carol Reed, Michael Powell,
David Lean, and the writing-directing
team of Frank Launder (b. 1907) and
Sidney Gilliat (b. 1908). Emulating the
Hollywood majors, the Rank Organi-
sation, a vertically integrated company
headed by
J. Arthur Rank (1888-1972),
was a powerful force in production,
distribution, and exhibition. And an
outstanding group of British performers
was doing screen work, most notable
among whom was Laurence Olivier
(1907-1989), who directed and starred
in
two Shakespeare adaptations, Henry V
(1945) and /-/am/ef (1948), the latter of
which won Hollywood's Academy Award
for best picture (and won for Olivier the
Oscar for best actor).
However, this foundation was not as
solid as
it may have appeared. As usual,
the problem was Britain's relations with
tnema
Hollywood. Concerned about renewed
American inroads on the domestic
market, the British government in 1947
placed a punishing 75 percent tax on the
value of imported films. The U.S. film
industry responded by refusing to send
films to Britain. British producers stepped
up their production commitments to
make up for the absence of American
films. When, after seven months, a com-
promise was reached and the boycott
ended, Hollywood films flooded into
British theaters and domestic producers
suffered severe losses. What was appar-
ently intended as a government policy to
protect domestic filmmakers had actually
harmed them.
In retrospect, the years 1945-48 seem
a small "golden age" of British cinema.
David Lean contributed Brief Encounter
(1945), a poignant, low-key work con-
cerning an unconsummated romance
between a man and a married woman,
with an exceptional performance by Celia
Johnson (1908-1982), as well as two
adaptations of novels by Charles Dickens,
Creaf Expectations (1946) and Oliver
7w/sf (1948). Reed directed Odd Man
Ouf (1947), concerning a hunted Irish
revolutionary portrayed by James Mason
(1909-1984), and The Fallen Idol (1948),
a thriller with the distinguished stage
actor Ralph Richardson (1902-1983).
Powell, with his collaborator Emeric
Pressburger, made among other works an
enormously popular Technicolor film
concerning a young ballet dancer, The
Red Shoes n948).
In subsequent years, comedy became
the most successful British genre in the
international marketplace. The veteran
producer Michael Balcon assembled a
skilled comedy team at Ealing Studios.
Its
key figure was actor Alec Guinness (b.
1914), who had launched his film career
with performances in Lean's two Dickens
films and made the leap to comedy by
playing eight different roles in Ealing's
Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949),
directed by Robert Hamer (1911-1963).
Guinness's other important comedies
included The Lavender Hill Mob (1951
),
directed by Charles Crichton (b. 1910),
and The Man in the White Suit (1951 ),
directed by Alexander Mackendrick
(b. 1912).

It was as
it Italy was passing the torch of
cinematic innovation from the neorealists to the Japanese; but the
Cannes festival also rang in with a best film award in 1954 to
Teinosuke Kinugasa's Jigokumon (Cate of Hell, 1953i, another
Academy Award winner. Two general points can be made about
these prize recipients: Japanese cinema's emphasis on the auton-
omy of directors accorded well with the 1950s' stress on art
cinema; and thev are all period films.
Akira Kurosawa
Kurosawa was working on a period picture, Tora no O o Fumo
Otokatachi {The Man Who Tread on the Tiger's
Tail), when Japan
surrendered; because the film dealt with a banned subject, occu-
pation censors held up
its release until 1952. The director turned
to contemporary themes in a series of postwar films, several of
them highly acclaimed, before returning to a period setting with
Rashomon. In this context one can better appreciate Kurosawa's
remark (quoted in Chapter 13
1 that there would have been more
meaning for him had he received a prize for a film about present-
day Japan— he mentioned as an example Bicycle Thieves, but he
might have spoken of his own Yoidore Tenshi
i Drunken Angel,
1948i, which Japanese critics consider the Bicycle Thieves of
postwar Japan.
If Los Olvidados, made in the same year, stood on the cusp
between social and art cinema, then Rashomon may be regarded
as the premiere work of an art cinema to start off the second half
of the centur\'. Though
its setting in a ruined temple in an indeter-
minate past time (twelfth century in the source story) and other
aspects of the film gave ample evidence to read
it as an allegory,
far more significant was
its narrative method—the telling of an
incident of a rape by five different people, with no effort by the
filmmaker to reconcile the conflicting versions, to arrive at a sin-
gle "truth." The method was not entirely novel
Citizen Kane, for
one example, had different characters narrating their views on
Charles Foster Kane's
life, with an ambiguous ending—but
it
spoke with particular force in postwar Europe and North America
(as well as Japan), where many were declaring their retreat from
ideology in favor of an existential avoidance of big "truths."
The film's sentimental ending,
in which
its common man hero,
the simple woodcutter, takes home an abandoned baby,
also responded to a desire for humanistic action in the face of
indeterminacv.
After Rashomon's prizes, Kurosawa did choose to make a kind
of neorealist film: Ikiru (translated as "To Live," but known by
its
original
title, 1952
1, concerning a dying bureaucrat who wakes up
to existence and struggles through the bureaucratic maze to get a
playground constructed.
It continued the sentimental, humanistic
tone of Rashomon's ending but also presented a devastating view
of bureaucratic complacencv and inertia, which the film's slow
pace accentuated. Kurosawa became known for his mastery of
mise-en-scene in natural settings, as in Rashomon or the remark-
able windswept final confrontation
in Sanshiro Sugata, vet Ikiru
also created a powerful vision of the world of petty officialdom,
in dim, run-down warrens dominated bv hugh stacks of bundled
documents, testimony to inaction.
The director returned to the outdoors with Seven Samurai, an
epic period film and a rousing adventure tale about a beleaguered
village that gathers a small band of warriors to defend against
marauding brigands. (The original film was more than three hours

long; a less impressive version with more than an hour cut out
also circulates.) Kurosawa's rise to prominence employed a regu-
lar company of performers; two who became internationally
known were Toshiro Mifune (b. 1920), who portrayed wild char-
acters in the bandit of Rashomon and the imposter samurai
in
Seven Samurai, and Takashi Shimura (1905-1982), who played
the contemplative figures of the dying bureaucrat in Ikiru and the
samurai leader of Seven Samurai.
Kenji Mizoguchi
while Kurosawa gained world fame within the first decade of his
career, Mizoguchi had been a filmmaker for nearly thirty years
before his prize for The Life ofOharu, his seventy-sixth film. With
support from a new production company aiming at the export
market, he was able to make a series of important films before his
death in 1956 at the age of fifty-eight. Several of these were on
his most persistent themes, the lives of suffering women, often
prostitutes and the Japanese entertainers and companions called
geisha. His most renowned film was Ugetsu, a period work
concerning a potter's encounter with the supernatural.
Ugetsu
is a unique film that bears comparison with European
traditions both of realism and Surrealism. Like Jean Renoir's films,
Ugetsu utilizes a moving camera and depth of field to create an
ample, complex sense of space, and,
like Renoir, Mizoguchi
shows the capacity to mingle farce and tragedy in the same
moment. But the visual style continually bursts the bounds of real-
328

ism by veering into dreams and the supernatural, as with Bufiuel.
Unlike either European tradition, however, or even Mizoguchi's
earlier work,
its tone
is ultimately serene and contemplative. Real
horrors have occurred— particularly to women— but in the end
the potter returns to his wheel, sustained by the ghost of his mur-
dered wife.
Gate ofHell
This multiple prize-winning film was honored primarily for
its use
of color.
It was one of the first Japanese color films and
it utilized
a new color process, Eastmancolor, introduced by Eastman Kodak
Company in 1950. Eastmancolor did not directly replace three-

strip Technicolor (see Chapter 8), since the Technicolor Company
had itself introduced a single lens color film pack in the 1940s,
but
it was considered more effective in low light circumstances
and gave a less brilliant, more muted range of color tones. Cate of
Hell was hailed for demonstrating the possibilities of the new
color process; a period film set in the twelfth century,
it featured
elaborate, flowing, intricately tinted and patterned clothing of the
ancient imperial court. In an unusual gesture,
its color consultant,
Sanzo Wada, won a Hollywood Academy Award for color cos-
tume design.
Its director, Teinosuke Kinugasa, whose career
began
in 1921, even earlier than Mizoguchi's, earned a more firm
place in film history with the rediscovery in the 1970s of his 1926
silent classic. Page of Madness (see Chapter 7).

Yasujiro Ozu
Left out in the international recognition of Japanese filmmakers, at
least initially, was Yasujiro Ozu. He did not lack for appreciation at
home, however. When he resumed filmmaking after the war he
quickly regained the high status he had held among Japanese crit-
ics in the 1930s. Banshun {Late Spring, 1949) and Bakushu {Early
Summer, 1951
) were voted top films of their year in a Japanese crit-
ics' poll, adding to three similar awards he had won before the war.
Ozu's films from Late Spring on look like almost no others in
cinema history. Austere and simple are two words that have
described these films, but they do not do justice to the audacious
artistic choices the director made. Basically, the camera does not
move. There may be two or three camera movements in a film
depicting exterior action—the camera following bicycle riders,
say, as
in Late Spring— but interior shots completely eschew pans
or dollies.
In Hollywood, when an actor rises, so does the camera,
so smoothly that we hardly notice; not in Ozu.
In Renoir's
films, the camera
is constantly, imperceptibly panning or moving
to reframe action; not in Ozu. Characters rise and move, the
camera remains motionless.
This camera style
is deployed in service of narratives in which,
in the conventional sense, very
little happens.
In Late Spring, an
adult daughter who doesn't want to leave her widowed father
is
persuaded to marry.
In Tokyo Monogatari {Tokyo Story, 1953),
generally regarded as Ozu's greatest film from this period, an
elderly couple visit their children
in Tokyo. They get in the way,
go home, the mother sickens and dies, and everyone regrets that
busy, cramped, and narrow lives impinge on family feelings. The
combination of Ozu's style and subject
is both distancing and
intimate;
in a world cinematic practice where family usually
means melodrama, Ozu's work constructs the poignancy of the
everyday as few films do. Chishu Ryo (b. 1906) and Setsuko Hara
(b. 1920) became key figures in Ozu's company of actors, Ryo
playing the elderly father, Hara the dutiful daughter,
in Late
Spring, Tokyo Story, and other films.

ITALY
Though recognition came to Japanese cinema of the postwar
period in terms of individual directors, Japan could
still lay claim
in the 1950s to a national cinema with an industrial mode of pro-
duction as in Hollywood. In Europe, however, that was less and
less the case. Filmmaking had become a series of one-man (and,
on rare occasions, one-woman) turns. Nowhere was this more
obvious than in Italy. Neorealism, as we have seen, became mori-
bund by the early 1950s. After Umberto D., Vittorio De Sica
made only three films in the 1950s; Roberto Rossellini had
become enmeshed in scandal over his affair with actress Ingrid
Bergman, whom he subsequently married, and the 1950s were
also unproductive years for him.

Luchino Visconti
The one neorealist director able to advance his work effectively in
the 1950s was Luchino Visconti. He made few films, but his work-
ing method had always been slow and his output meager. Senso
(1954), admired in
its time as a beautiful Technicolor film but a
retreat from neorealism into historical melodrama (and not
screened in the United States until the late 1960s), has grown in
stature to become regarded as one of the major Italian films of the
postwar era.
Its treatment of the Italian Risorgimento—the
national revival of the mid-nineteenth century that led to the for-
mation of the Italian state— is embedded in a melodrama of
adultery but nevertheless raises fundamental questions of class,
power, and historical meaning that make
it in many ways a more
effective political film than the didactic La terra trema. Visconti's
Rocco e
i suoi fratelli (Rocco and His Brothers, 1960), a remark-
able working-class melodrama three hours in length, had been
heavily cut for international distribution and only began circulat-
ing in
its complete version
in the 1990s.
Federico Fellini
The most remarkable phenomenon of 1950s art cinema— in Italy
or any other place— was the rise to international prominence of
Federico Fellini (b. 1920). Fellini had played a significant role in
neorealism as a coscriptwriter on Rossellini's Rome, Open City
and Paisan, and on important films by other directors. But when
he began his career as director (after a codirecting effort with
Alberto Lattuada), he made a droll absurdist comedy, Lo sceicco
bianco (The White Sheik, 1952). This small work has several
priceless moments, especially a parody on scenes of film produc-
tion: cast and crew go to the beach to shoot a scene, but
it
is for a
magazine that publishes serialized photo-novellas, and when the
director calls out the equivalent of "action!" the actors freeze in
their poses. The film launched the career of Alberto Sordi
(b. 1919), who played the Sheik, as Italy's most po|)ular film per-
sonality of his era (though little-known outside Italy). But
it was
not a film that heralded Fellini's nomination, to use language that
would soon be invoked, as the greatest director of the epoch.
LA STRADA.
That rare acclaim Came with his third film,
/.a
strada (translated as "The Road," but known
in the United States
and Britain as La Strada, 1954).
It may be useful to approach La
Strada first as a phenomenon, then as a film. Greeted as a master-
piece on
its release, decades later
it
is
still placed at the pinnacle
of cinematic achievement by some critics and historians, while
ignored or downgraded by others. La Strada still has fared better
than
its director, whose reputation has not sustained the high level
it reached for a period with this and several subsequent films.
With the passing of time
it
is possible to see Fellini's triumph
with La Strada as a symptom of something other than the film
itself (or the director). La Strada spoke to and for the changing cul-
ture of an era. Whereas neorealist films, including all that Fellini
wrote, were indelibly located in time and place. La Strada,
though nominally set in postwar Italy, was bound by neither time
nor place.
It was not local,
it was universal— not marked by soci-
ety or history, but addressing the "human condition." The Road
was any road and every road. To
its fervent admirers,
it was
not a narrative like a prose work,
it was cinema as poetry.
In La Strada, an itinerant circus strongman, Zampano (played
by American actor Anthony Quinn) buys a child-woman,
Gelsomina, from her mother to be his assistant. Gelsomina was
portrayed by the director's wife, Giulietta Masina (b. 1921), with a
mischievous pantomime style and comic innocence that led to
comparisons with Chaplin and the American silent comic Harry
Langdon. Abused by the strongman, she finds support from a
high-wire performer,
II Matto (The Fool, played by another
American, Richard Basehart). He tells her that in God's eyes
everything, even a stone, has a purpose, and she intuits that

FILM AUTHORS
OF THE 1950S
If Fellini became the first star of 1950s art cinema, he was soon
joined at the top by Sweden's Ingmar Bergman ib. 1918). Together
the pair came to represent this era of cinema, and the debates
over their reputations often reflect critical disagreements about
how to define film art. Though vastly different in background
and temperament— Fellini from a Southern Catholic tradition,
Bergman from Northern Protestantism—the two shared a taste for
universalizing and a desire to place religion at the center of their
filmmaking.
Ingmar Bergman
Bergman began directing films in 1946. Some of the fifteen films
he made in his first decade received wider distribution after he
became famous, but
it was not until Sommarnattens Leende
{Smiles of a Summer Sight, 1955i that he achieved substantial
recognition beyond Scandinavia. Perhaps
it was ironic that a
director later known for brooding, heav\, dark, religious, and
psychological dramas should emerge internationally with a
sophisticated sex comedy, but
it points to a side of Bergman's
sensibilitv that should not be ignored. This tale of sexual rivalry,
jealousN, and enlightenment was indebted to Mozart's The
Marriage of Figaro, among other works, and inspired composer
Stephen Sondheim's Broadwav musical A Little Sight Music as
well as the Woody Allen film A Midsummer Sight's Sex Comedy
(1982).
Bergman followed Smiles of a Summer Sight \\\\.h two films
released in 1957, Det Sjunde Inseglet {The Seventh Seah and
Smultronstallet
{ Wild Strawberries}, that played the same role in
his career as La Strada in Fellini's—thev shifted his focus from
comedy to cosmic themes, and elevated his status to preeminent
cinematic artist. They are like La Strada as well
in dealing with
questions about Cod's presence in the world,
life's absurdities.

and the loneliness and coldness of death. The Seventh Se^l dra-
matizes these issues in medieval times (as in a Japanese period
film). Wild Strawberries was more characteristically for the direc-
tor a contemporary film with links to the past: an elderly professor
of medicine narrates in voice-over his thoughts while en route to
receive an honorary degree. Along with the occurrences on his
drive, he has disturbing symbolic dreams and also dreams in
which he witnesses events of his youth at which he was not pres-
ent. The profundity of its themes
is leavened by a light touch of
comedy, and the film offers the special poignancy of casting as
the professor Victor Sjostrom, the pioneer Swedish film director
who had a brief Hollywood stint in the 1920s (under the name
Seastromi. The professor's age in the film
is exactly Sjostrom's; his
dream reminiscences are also by implication a look back at the
youth of Swedish cinema, at the moment when
it was finally
attaining international recognition.
Carl Th. Dreyer
As
it had with Bunuel, art cinema gave new recognition to a great
but largely inactive filmmaker, Carl Th. Dreyer of Denmark.
Acknowledged as one of the world's most important film artists at
the end of the silent era with The Passion ofJoan of Arc i^928},
Dreyer in his first sound film, Vampyri Vampire, 1932), made an
avant-garde work in the guise of a commercial production. Eleven
years passed before his next completed film, Vredens Dag (Day
of Wrath, 1943), and a decade between Tva Manniskor
( Two
People, 1945) and Ordet ("The Word," but known by its original
title, 1955). This latter film, however, won a prize at Venice and
went on to become the director's biggest commercial success.
Its
narrative about a woman who dies in childbirth and
is brought
back to
life by an act of faith continued Dreyer's focus on reli-
gious themes, dating back to Leaves from Satan's Book {^92^
},
and spoke to the spiritual concerns of 1950s audiences as did
many of the significant films of art cinema.

Satyajit Ray
The strong cinema culture of India, like Japan's, was barely
known
in Europe and North America (though
it exported films to
other Asian countries, Africa, and the Middle East). The term
"national cinema" seems inappropriate for India, since until 1947
it remained a British colony, and after independence (when the
former colony was split into two nations, India and Pakistan) films
were made in several languages and cultural styles.
It took the era
of art cinema to bring Indian film to woHd recognition, not as a
whole, but largely in the person of a single, and hardly typical,
filmmaker, Satyajit Ray (1921-1992).
Born to an intellectual family in Calcutta, Ray started his career
in advertising, and was a founder of the Calcutta Film Society in
1947. His interest in making films began to develop when he met
Jean Renoir in India during the making of Renoir's The River
(1951). Further impetus came during a trip to England (just as pio-
neer Indian filmmaker Dadasaheb Phaike made a similar journey
before making his first film) and from a viewing of De Sica's
Bicycle Thieves, which showed Ray that a film could be made
with location shooting and nonprofessional actors. He began
shooting Father Pancha li (^955), adapted from a popular Bengali
novel. The project took four years and was finally completed with
financial support from the state government of West Bengal. At
Cannes in 1956
it won a prize as "best human document," and
Ray's career was launched.
Father Fanchali eventually became part of "the Apu trilogy"
with /AparayVfo (1956), which won a major prize at Venice, and

Satyajit Ray's breakthrough into the inter-
national art cinema with his first films
inaugurated a debate within Indian film
culture. With an immensely popular
commercial film industry' already in
place, among the issues were: was there
a need or a desire for an art cinema prac-
tice?; who would be the audience for
such films?; how important was interna-
tional recognition and prestige?; and
what would be the cultural significance
of films that might be more popular
overseas than at home? These same ques-
tions have animated many national film
cultures when films that may be contro-
versial or underappreciated among
domestic audiences find success in other
countries.
Ray's triumphs in Europe and North
America did not open doors for other
Indian filmmakers; there was no general
breakthrough for Indian cinema, as was
the case in the 1950s with Japanese film.
This should not obscure the fact that
Indian films were popular in other parts
of Asia, in Africa, and in the Middle East,
or that other filmmakers were gaining
recognition in the Soviet Union and
Soviet bloc countries. Raj Kapoor
(b. 1924), who began his career as a
young actor with the Bombay Talkies
company, became an international figure
wherever popular Indian films were
shown with his third work as a director,
Awara
( The Vagabond, 1951
), a nearly
three-hour melodrama with songs in
which he also performed. The films of
Kapoor and other Bombay filmmakers,
film historian Ro\ Armes has written,
combined "an awareness of the require-
ments of box office success with a
clear sympathy for the poor and the
oppressed."
The situation was more difficult,
according to historians of Indian film, for
filmmakers who attempted to be innova-
tors or artists within the framework of the
commercial film industry', without achiev-
ing the international celebrity of Ray
or Kapoor. Guru Dutt (1925-1964), like
Kapoor a director-performer in the
Bombay cinema, was said to have taken
his own
life because of problems in his
career following the failure of his last film
as director, Kaaghaz ke Phool {Paper
Flowers, 1959), which ironically was con-
cerned with the death of a once-famous
film director who had fallen on hard
times. Ritwak Chatak (1925-1976), a
Bengali who following his death was
characterized by Ray as a filmmaker
entirely without foreign influences (unlike
Ray himself, who credited the impact of
Italian neorealism on his work), sought to
make political films within the conven-
tions of Indian popular melodrama. His
principal works include Ajantrik [Pathetic
Fallacy, 1958) and Meghe Dhaka Tara
( The Cloud Capped Star, 1960).
Mrinal Sen (b. 1923)
is probably the
best-known Indian filmmaker in Europe
and the United States after Satyajit Ray.
Also from Bengal, Sen began his career in
the 1950s but only began to make a mark
with Bhuvan Shome (1969; the title
is the
name of the film's protagonist), a break-
through work that utilized the Hindi
rather than Bengali language and thus
was accessible to wider audiences in
India. A political filmmaker like Chatak,
but more internationally oriented in style.
Sen has gained prizes at festivals such as
Cannes and Berlin.

Apur Sansar (The World of Apu, 1958). (The first two films also
have English-language titles—5ong of the Road and The Unvan-
qu/shec/ respectively— but are generally known by their original
titles, unlike the third.) The films tell the story of a young man,
Apu, from birth and childhood in Father Panchali to youth in
Aparajito and manhood
in The World of Apu. All three show the
influence of neorealism
in their unblinking treatment of poverty
and
its psychological effects on individuals, but they also link
emotional states to visual representation of the natural environ-
ment, as in the symbolic shots of water in Father Fanchali. Indian
composer and sitar player Ravi Shankar wrote and performed the
musical scores for all three films.
Jacques Tati
India's experience with Ray repeated a pattern developing else-
where in the 1950s, of an art cinema existing alongside, and
obviously intersecting, a commercial cinema. In France a signifi-
cant example came in the films of Jacques Tati (1908-1982),
which were both highly popular with audiences and proclaimed
by discerning critics as a special kind of cinematic art. Tati was
director, scriptwriter, and performer in his films. He launched his
enduring screen character, Hulot,
in Les Vacances de Monsieur
HuiotiMr Hulot's Holiday, 1953). This tall, pipe-smoking figure,
who walked as
if listing forward, was not a star comic persona
in
the traditional sense, but more a catalyst and observer of human

camera at a distance and
let the scene unfold and the spectator
discover
its humor without an insistent style of close-ups and
inserts to pinpoint the joke. He played Hulot in three other films,
Mon Oncle ("My Uncle," but known by
its original title, 1958),
P/c3>'f/me(1967), and
Trafic [Traffic, 1971).
Robert Bresson
Another French filmmaker working in the mode of art cinema,
Robert Bresson (b. 1907), won less commercial success but more
critical recognition than Tati, with prizes at Venice ior Journal
d'un cure de campagne [Diary of a Country Priest, 1950) and at
Cannes for Un Condamne a mort s'est echappe (literally "A Con-
demned Man Escapes," but more generally known
in English as A
Man Escaped, 1956). Beginning with the former film, his style
emphasized nonprofessional performers, use of a diary-like
voice-over with very little dialogue, and a concern with religious
themes. A Man Escaped, set during World War
II, recounts the
escape from prison of a Frenchman about to be executed by the
Germans.
It
is not an adventure film so much as an account,
through close observation of small details, of a man's preparation

realism; "The supernatural in film," he said, "is only the real

Andrzej Wajda
One must proceed with caution
in treating the emergence of
postwar cinema in Eastern Europe. Countries with cinematic tradi-
tions such as Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia after 1945
became socialist states and members of the east bloc under Soviet
leadership— an epoch that ended around 1990 and will be sub-
ject to considerable historical revision in years to come. During
the first decade after the war, a period of physical reconstruction
and ideological consolidation, few films were made, and those
under strict government controls.
It remains a mystery not yet fully
explained how a Polish filmmaker, Andrzej Wajda (b. 1926), burst
on the international scene with remarkable films in the late 1950s.
Wajda's first film and two subsequent works
Pokolenie iCen-
eration, 1954), Kanal (1957), and Popiol
i diament (Ashes and
Diamonds. 1958i— all deal with events at the end of the war. As
it seems at this point inevitable to say, Kanal won an award at
Cannes, Ashes and Diamonds a critics' prize at Venice. Such
international recognition overwhelmed the Polish government's
unease about the films. Critics generally focus on the works' dis-
sent from official ideology, with considerably detailed analysis of
their subtle opposition to party line viewpoints. Important as this
independence may have been to critics outside Eastern Europe,
it
could not by itself have brought the films such acclaim. Ashes
and Diamonds in particular was a visual triumph, a virtuoso
example b\ Wajda and director of photograph\' Jerzy Wojcik of
deep-focus and long-take cinematography hardly matched in
world cinema for nearly two decades, since Citizen Kane.

YEARS OF FRUITION
For spectators who followed new developments in cinema, the
second half of the 1950s became years of increasing excitement
and anticipation. Not since the late 1920s, when films by
Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Dovzhenko, and others began to arrive from
the Soviet Union, had there been such a sense of renewal
in the
medium. Filmgoers in the United States also began to participate
in the international art cinema movement; though American audi-
ences had previously been given few opportunities to see foreign
films in the country's Hollywood-dominated iheaters, the bre.ikup
of the studio system and declines in Hollywood production during
the 1950s led a number of theaters
in cities and university towns
to become "art houses" playing new and classic works from over-
seas. Viewing the films of Bergman,
Fellini, and others, a growing
number of Americans learned to regard cinema as a serious form
of art (a recognition that as yet almost no one had granted to the
products of the commercial film industry).
Then, at the turn of the decade,
in the years 1959-60, a series
of films appeared that seemed to confirm every expectation and

herald the arrival of a new era of cinematic art. Several were first
features by French directors and will be discussed in Chapter 17 in
the context of that country's emerging film movement. We will
focus here on two films by directors already mentioned in this
book, Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Fellini's La
dolce vita ("The Sweet Life," but known
in the United States and
Britain as La Dolce Vita, 1960), and Antonioni's L'avventura ("The
Adventure," but known as L'Avventura, 1960) were indexes to
how both the cinema and society had changed since 1945.
La Dolce Vita
Fellini's film was a three-hour epic on Roman decadence— not
ancient Rome, but Rome of 1960. To the coscriptwriter of
Rossellini's 1945 film on wartime Rome,
it had become "Rome,
Wide-Open City."
It was a place of indulgence, emptiness, and
publicity, working together synergistically in a downward spiral.
Witness to, and victim of, this combination was Marcello, por-
trayed by Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni (b. 19241 in a role
that made him a star. La Dolce Vita locates the roots of Rome's
moral decay in Italy's recent history (there are veiled references to
Fascism), but the city, like the film itself, draws on an interna-
tional cast: English, French, German, and Spanish as well as
Italian are spoken on the soundtrack.
The film's sexual candor helped make
it a sensation in 1960
(Hollywood was
still operating on the 1930s Code). Since subse-
quent filmmaking has gone far beyond
it in sexual matters, what
does La Dolce Vita offer to later generations? Critics have noted in
the opening and closing scenes— a helicopter carrying a statue
of Jesus at the beginning, Marcello's inability to hear a young
woman calling to him at the end— echoes of the Divine Comedy,
the great Christian poem by the thirteenth-century Florentine,
Dante Alighieri. Thus the film might be regarded as a journey
through a modern hell. In cinema terms, one might recall Billy
Wilder's Ace in the Hole (1951
), and see in La Dolce Vita a
depiction of contemporary life as a "big carnival" of spectacle,
hype, and death (as when a man
is trampled to death amid the

What of the religious themes that animated La Strada^ At the
site of the recorded vision, a woman says,
"If you look for God,
you find Him everywhere." The characters of La Dolce Vita are
not looking for God, and
if He
is looking for them, they turn away.
The film
is not as insistent on
its religious motifs as
is La Strada.
Nevertheless, at the end the young woman whom Marcello can-
not hear— signifying his lost opportunity to regain contact with
innocence and a fresh start— turns her gaze toward the camera,
implicating us spectators in the question of our own relationship
lo innocence,
lost opportunities, and perhaps to God.
UAvventura
At
its premiere screening at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival,
Antonioni's film was greeted by shouts and whistles from the
audience (its equivalent of boos). This was perhaps a litmus test of
toleration for art cinema— if art and commercialism were at
opposite ends of the cinema spectrum, of how far toward art the
medium could go (and
still remain commercial). But thirty-five
critics and filmmakers, including Roberto Rossellini, issued a
statement supporting the film, and the Cannes jury voted
it a
special prize. The film became a cause celcbre and, after all, a
commercial success.
The complaint against L'Avventura was that "nothing happens."
Indeed, the title must be ironic, for the adventure in the film
is
almost purely visual and psychological:
it probably rejects narra-
tive more thoroughly than any commercial fiction feature film
made to that time. Within the first twenty-five minutes, a woman
disappears while on a boating trip; for nearly two hours more, her
fiance and her best friend— the latter portrayed by Monica Vitti
(b. 1931
)
in her first important screen role— search for her and
form an ambiguous attachment.
The film touches briefly on some of the themes that were
central to La Dolce Vita: the hedonism of the wealthy, a sense of
life's absurdity, celebrity and publicity, women as spectacle. But
it
is a work that communicates primarily through
its visual structure
and mise-en-scene: through tight close-ups framed
in disorienting
ways, contrasted with extraordinary use of deep space and
objects in the distance.
Italy's architectural heritage and natural
scenery become, as a line of dialogue in the film suggests, a
"stage setting" for empty, futile lives.
Arriving within a few months of each other in 1960, these two
films— by Italian directors who had begun as filmmakers under
Fascism, contributed to neorealism, and become leading avatars
of art cinema— seemed to cast a critical eye back across the pro-
found changes that had occurred
in very few years.
If La Dolce
Vita and L'Avventura were triumphs of a successful art cinema
movement that had grown up in the postwar period, they also
assessed the moral costs incurred
in Europe's revival since 1945,
"Year Zero" of the new era.

^^ ^^^ present time center on those
B
areas— such as the histories of Soviet or
Eastern European cinema— where old
orthodoxies have broken down, archives have been opened up,
and new freedoms to see and speak have refashioned knowledge
and viewpoints. Yet even well-known filmmaking practices, about
which information
is plentiful and full candor unimpeded, can
raise complex historical questions. Hollywood in the 1950s
is a
case in point: there
is no comparable film industry or historical
era
in which such a wide gap has opened up between the films
that the industry itself thought important and other, different
works that have become significant for later generations. This gap
already existed in the 1950s, when two distinct viewpoints on
Hollywood came to the fore.
DECLINE OR ARTISTIC
TRIUMPH?
The first view, held within the United States film industry, was
shaped by a continuation of Hollywood's experience of crisis and
decline that began with the postwar drop in movie attendance,
the HUAC hearings, and the Paramount case (see Chapter 14). By
the early 1950s television was clearly in the ascendancy as the
new mass medium of popular choice. Movies appeared to be in
the same situation as the passenger trains that were just at that
time losing out to air travel: a once-colossal force, now obsoles-
cent. By 1960 the weekly average of people going to the movies
had fallen 63 percent since 1946. This decline led in turn to
reductions in production, profits, and employment in the motion
picture industry. The total number of films produced in the United
States by major studios and independent companies fell below
two hundred for the first time in 1959 (until World War
II that fig-
ure had averaged close to five hundred). With movie attendance
no longer a matter of habit but of choice, the industry placed
greater emphasis on technological innovations and on "prestige"
pictures drawn from "pre-sold" properties such as best-selling
novels or Broadway musical
hits. Films with these features were
the ones the industry praised and to which
it gave awards.
A different viewpoint was put forward at the same time, how-
ever, that focused not on decline but on the triumph of individual
filmmakers. Advocated at first only by a few critics writing for a
small film journal
in France, Cahiers du Cinema, over time, and
with substantial modification,
it has achieved a remarkable con-
sensus as the dominant conception not only about Hollywood
in
the 1950s but about American commercial filmmaking as a
whole. The critics of Cahiers du Cinema looked at Hollywood as
others saw the international art cinema: as a cinema of auteurs, of
directors as "authors" of their works.
Although the filmmakers whom the critics found significant
were in every case successful Hollywood directors, they were def-
initely not those most highly honored within the industry
itself.
And they worked within a commercial film industry, not in the
framework of "art cinema" as that term applied to European and
Asian directors of the 1950s. Nevertheless, the French critics
regarded their Hollywood films more highly than they did the
344

works of Europe's contemporarv film artists. In one of the jour-
nal's annual polls ranking the best films of the year, Alfred
Hitchcock's Rear Window {1954) was rated above Fellini's La
Strada; in others, Nicholas Rav's Rebel Without a Cause (1955)
ranked over Visconti's Senso and Bergman's Smiles of a Summer
Night, Orson Welles's Touch of Evil (1958) over Bergman's The
Seventh Seal, and Howard Havvks's Rio Bravo (1959> over
Bergman's Wild Straw berries. Their 1957 poll, as something of a
polemical statement,
listed ten Hollywood films made in 1956-57
among twenty titles.
FulK
to understand this iconoclastic critical stance requires a
sense of its context in French filmmaking and critical discourses
(to be treated in Chapter 17). For now, what
is important
is to
know what the critics admired
in the Hollywood films and film-
makers that they favored. The answer, as Jim Hillier has stressed in
his English-language editions of selected Cahiers du Cinema criti-
cism from the 1950s and 1960s,
is mise-en-scene. "What matters
in a film," said critic Fereydoun Hoveyda, "is the desire for order,
composition, harmony, the placing of actors and objects, the
movements within the frame, the capturing of a movement or a
look; in short, the intellectual operation which has put an initial
emotion and a general idea to work. Mise en scene is nothing
other than the technique invented b\ each director to express the
idea and establish the specific quality of his work."'
concept of technique remains central. This
is in contrast to the
Hollywood film industry perspective of the 1950s, where what
mattered most was not technique but technology.
THREE-DIMENSION AND
WIDESCREEN FILMS
By 1950, nearly two decades had passed without major changes
in the visual or sound technologies of motion pictures: a filmgoer
in that year saw pretty much the same screen image as a spectator
in 1930. A number of small advances had been made in sound
recording, camera lenses, film stocks, and other technical aspects,
to be sure, that had improved the viewing experience or made
possible stylistic shifts in areas such as lighting or depth of field.
Perhaps the most obvious change had been the replacement of
two-strip Technicolor by the three-strip process in the mid-1930s,
but in 1950 the number of color films screened in United States
theaters still represented less than 20 percent of all releases. The
Great Depression of the 1930s and then World War
II perhaps
created circumstances that limited technological innovation in the
movies, but with attendance falling and television threatening in
the postwar years, the time had come to try improving the screen
image as a way to lure patrons back to movie theaters.
N THE
1 950S
In a sense this concept of mise-en-scene, as with much else
written by the Cahiers du Cinema critics, was notoriously vague.
But in another sense
it was completely precise:
it referred to a
director's visual style as the whole of a film, containing of course
the contributions of scriptwriter, art director, cinematographer,
and others, but greater than the sum of its parts. Where the
camera was placed; how the performers were blocked; what
happened when the camera and the actors began to move
these were the director's responsibility, they marked his or her
technique, they were the fundamental decisions that, as Hoveyda
wrote, expressed the ideas and established the quality of the
work.
This was not an viewpoint that sprang solely from watching
Hollywood films.
It derived from Andre Bazin's ideas about cine-
matic realism (see "Bazin and Neorealism," Chapter 13) and
it
never went so far as to put Hollywood directors at the pinnacle of
cinematic achievement; the Cahiers du Cinema critical consensus
valued filmmakers such as Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini,
Carl Th. Dreyer, and Kenji Mizoguchi more highly than any
Hollywood figure as masters of mise-en-scene. But what
is impor-
tant in this context
is
its respectful and closely observant attitude
toward films made in a commercial film industry practice. After
the ideas of the Cahiers du Cinema critics took hold,
it became
much less common for critics to dismiss Hollywood filmmakers as
faceless factory functionaries, or for films to be valued solely for
their scripts or their sets. Although the notion of the auteur has
been considerably modified since
it was put forward in the 1950s,
to take more clearly into account collaborative contributions to
film art and more nuanced ideas about individual creativity, the
3-D
The first new development in the screen image to arrive in the-
aters was 3-D, or third-dimensionality. Like many other motion
picture innovations, this one had a long history. As early as 1897
three-dimensional effects had been created with projected mov-
ing images using the principles of stereoscopy (these may be most
familiar through the nineteenth century viewing devices which,
when held up to the eyes, merged two pictures into a single three-
dimensional image). Applied in the 1890s to magic lanterns and
then to cinema, the process was called the "anaglyph" method.
It
utilized red and blue filters both in projection and in spectacles
worn by viewers. A camera recorded images with two lenses
positioned as far apart as human eyes. The two images were then
projected onto a single screen, superimposed one on the other.
The filters on the spectacles separated the single image back into
two, and the images were then merged in the spectator's brain
(as in the normal process of human seeing) back into one
three-dimensional picture. Similar methods of creating three-
dimensional moving images were revived briefly in the 1920s.
In the 1930s 3-D image-making was advanced through the
principles of polarization, the basis of the Polaroid
still camera.
This also required filters on projectors and the use of spectacles
by viewers; these filters separated the images through so-called
polarizers that passed light only in certain planes.
It enabled
three-dimensional viewing of color images, as the red and blue
filters did not. Polarized stereoscopic movies were screened in
Germany in the 1930s and at the New York World's Fair of
1939-40. In the Soviet Union an inventor developed a process on
the principle of the parallax stereogram that did not require view-

ers to wear spectacles. About a dozen special theaters were con-
structed in the U.S.S.R. during the 1940s for screenings using this
method, using back projection and special grids on both sides of
the screen to perform the separations that filters accomplished
in other methods.
If viewers moved their heads, however, they
might lose the three-dimensional effects, and this system did not
catch on.
The Festival of Britain, held
in London
in 1951, marked the
breakthrough for 3-D processes. The Festival commissioned a
number of short films that were screened with the polarized
stereoscopic method. Their popularity caught the attention of the
United States film industry. By late 1952 the first 3-D feature film,
Bwana Devil, produced and directed by Arch Oboler, was ready
for release; a crude "African adventure" film combining travel-
ogue footage with backlot acted scenes,
it was nevertheless a
novelty sensation, as spectators screamed when spears appeared
to be heading in their direction. All the major studios put 3-D
films into production. Warner Bros, made a huge success in 1953
with House of Wax, a horror thriller that went even further than
Bwana Devil in directing threatening action toward the audience.
(Interestingly, the producer of House of Wax, Bryan Foy, had
directed the first all-talking picture. Lights of New York,
in 1928.)
In
all, twenty-three features were released by Hollywood stu-
dios in 1953
in 3-D. These included works in nearly every major
genre, but featured particularly science fiction films and Westerns,
in which spectacular visual effects could be utilized to draw audi-
ences. In 1954, the number of releases was thirteen, including
Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder. In 1955 the total was
exactly one, and in 1956— zero. The 3-D craze lasted less than
three years. Viewers complained of the spectacles, poor projec-
tion, and, by and large, lousy movies. Over the interim decades,
only a handful of films using stereoscopic processes have been
made. Twentieth-century audiences have not applauded every
technological innovation, at least not always for long. The best of
the 3-D movies survive in "flat" prints, while occasional nostal-
gia screenings of 3-D prints are held to give new generations a
chance to view a film
in the 1950s way, through polarized
spectacles.
Widescreen
Unlike 3-D, the widescreen processes introduced
in the early
1950s did bring about a fundamental transformation in the motion
picture image, even
if most of them did not last a great deal
longer than three-dimensionality. They included Cinerama,
Cinemascope, and Vista Vision, all of which eventually gave way
to a different widescreen system, Panavision, developed in the
early 1950s but not generally put into use until the 1960s.
Widescreen achieved at least one of the goals of the motion
picture industry: marking a fundamental difference between
movies and the commercial television image. After the advent of
widescreen processes, few films were made in the traditional
aspect ratio—the relation of width to height—that prevailed
before the 1950s and was close to the ratio of the television
screen. When widescreen films were released to broadcast televi-
sion (or,
later, as video cassettes) they were reduced to television's
ratio either by cutting off the sides or by "panning and scanning"
to highlight different areas of the frame, a form of editing for tele-
vision that changes the screen image from the original. When
347

movies began to be released for home viewing on laser disks in
the 1980, original vvidescreen ratios were restored through "letter-
boxing," reducing the image in size with black borders on top
and bottom. Letter-boxed movies appeared occasionally on cable
television stations in the early 1990s, and one could hope that
new generations would have a greater chance to see widescreen
films from the 1950s in their original form.
CINERAMA. The search for a workable widescreen technology
led the Hollywood studios back to the processes that had briefly
appeared, then disappeared, around 1930 (see Chapter 8). How-
ever, the first widescreen process to arrive in theaters in the 1950s
was new to the feature film industry.
It had been tried out at the
prewar New York Wodd's Fair in a film presentation called the
Perisphere, utilizing a spherical screen and eleven projectors.
During World War
II
its inventor, Fred Waller (1886-1954),
adapted the process for training in aerial gunnery. In the late
1940s Waller simplified the system down to three cameras and
gave
it a new name. Cinerama.
In Cinerama, the cameras widened the field of vision by pho-
tographing the same image from three different angles. When
projected on a semicircular screen, the images filled the specta-

tor's peripheral vision and created a perceptual response that pro-
duced physical sensations of movement. A curved screen and the
multiple projection system were installed in a New York theater
and the system was previewed with a film,

September 1952. With the opening shots of a roller coaster ride,
spectators experienced a visceral reaction that recalled the
legendary stories of 1890s audiences screaming at scenes of
onrushing locomotives. The realistic effects were enhanced by
stereophonic sound recording utilizing speakers placed around
the theater auditorium. Cinerama became a headline sensation.
Despite
its considerable early success, however. Cinerama was
limited by several factors.
Its special screen and projection system
were installed
in fewer than a dozen theaters in the United States,
along with about thirty in other countries. Problems were
reported in meshing the three projected images, and the only
films made for the process in the first few years were documen-
tary travelogues. Some fiction features were shot in Cinerama in
the early 1960s, but by that time the Walt Disney Company had
installed a full 360-degree circular movie screen, using eleven
cameras, at Disneyland
in California, and other widescreen
processes had become standard. In the mid-1960s Cinerama gave
up
its three-camera/projector process and went to a single image
system.
CINEMASCOPE.
Twentieth Century-Fox acquired the rights
to the anamorphic system developed by French inventor Henri
Chretien as far back as the 1920s— with a camera lens that
"squeezed" a wider image onto standard 35mm film and a pro-
jector lens that "unsqueezed"
it, projecting
it up to twice the
width of traditional screen size. Technologically updated, and
renamed CinemaScope, the process was unveiled in September
1953 with The Robe, directed by Henry Koster. This form of
widescreen required exhibitors only to purchase an anamorphic
projection lens and widen their screens—though often they were
not widened enough to accommodate the full CinemaScope
image— and within two years a majority of the world's screens
was equipped for widescreen.
Fox made the biggest commitment to
its own process, produc-
ing more than 150 CinemaScope films from 1953 to 1960. Most
of the other Hollywood studios also utilized CinemaScope for
their widescreen efforts, though RKO had
its own anamorphic
lenses and released a few films in what
it called SuperScope
(before the company ceased production
in 1958). Paramount,
meanwhile, developed
its own non-anamorphic widescreen
process, called VistaVision. This involved exposing the film hori-
zontally rather than
in the normal vertical fashion, so that the
wide image existed fully on the negative, instead of the anamor-
phic system's squeezed negative image. For positive prints, frames
were reduced
in size so they could
fit vertically on standard
35mm film. VistaVision produced an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (about
midway between standard 1.33:1 and CinemaScope's widest
2.66:1
), which seemed to many exhibitors a more practical screen
size. In all
its formats, widescreen fostered greater use of color
and stereophonic sound, as well as experimentation with larger
film stocks such as 70mm— sometimes in projection prints blown
up from 35mm.
PANAVisiON.
Developed by Robert E. Cottschalk (1918-
1982), Panavision utilized an anamorphic lens with variable
aspect ratios.
It was prized for
its clarity and definition whether

projected anamorphically or as a wider standard image (as in
VistaVision). By 1963 Panavision production outnumbered
Cinemascope, and the latter process was virtually phased out by
1967.
Widescreen served as only a temporary palliative for Holly-
wood's audience decline. Average weekly attendance rose in the
years 1954-56 as spectators returned to theaters to take a look at
highly-publicized new technologies, but when their novelty wore
off the deeper causes for audience loss— lifestyle changes and
television— reasserted themselves. Attendance fell off sharply in
1957 and continued an inexorable drop until
it leveled off in the
early 1970s at a figure approximately one-fourth the total of
moviegoers in Hollywood's best years (these trends and their
significance will be discussed
in later chapters).
Surprisingly
little critical or historical attention has been paid to
the impact of widescreen on filmmaking aesthetics. For those
who emphasized mise-en-scene,
like the Cahiers du Cinema crit-
ics, widescreen was welcomed as a development that seemed to
enhance the long-take and moving-camera style. Others worried
that the wider image would only be further justification for banal
spectacle. As with any technology, what
is significant
is not
its
inherent nature but the artistic and intellectual uses to which
it
is
put. The aesthetics of the widescreen image deserve much closer
study.
HOLLYWOOD AUTEURS
The gap between the French critics' view of Hollywood and
Hollywood's view of itself was not attributable to widescreen or
other technological factors. Directors whom the critics labeled
auteurs made widescreen films, color films, even spectacle films.
The difference lay perhaps in aesthetic criteria of judgment,

having to do with subjective opinions about visual artistry
and thematic significance. But these distinctions also drew
on assumptions about an industry and
its creative workers.
"There are no doubt two Hollywoods," Jacques Rivette wrote
in a 1955 essay, "the Hollywood of sums and the Hollywood of
individuals."'
Cahiers du Cinema critics rated Howard Hawks, Alfred
Hitchcock, and Nicholas Ray as the most important Hollywood
directors. Hawks had received only one Academy Award nomina-

in a career spanning five decades, for his direction of
Sergeant York (1941
); in 1974 he was given a special Oscar as "a
master Annerican filmmaker whose creative efforts hold a distin-
guished place in world cinema," wording that suggests his
overseas recognition. Hitchcock never won an Academy Award
for directing, although he was nominated five times— for Rebecca
(1940), /./Yeboaf (1944), Spellbound {^945), Rear IV/nc/oiv (1954),
and Psycho (1960). In 1967 he received the Irving G. Thalberg
Memorial Award, usually given to producers. Ray was nominated
only once, as the author of the original story for Rebel Without a
Cause (1955).
Auteur Criticism
"The evidence on the screen
is the proof of Hawks's genius,"
begins Rivette's 1953 essay, "The Genius of Howard Hawks."^
Such hyperbole has become outmoded in critical writing, but at
the time
it served a salutary purpose—-it stirred passions, fostered
debate, got people to look at Hollywood films and the creative
personnel behind them with a discriminating scrutiny as rarely
before. Previous criticism had not ignored directors, but was more
oriented toward studios and genres. Eric Rohmer and Claude
Chabrol published a book on Hitchcock in France in 1957, at a
time well before filmmakers became subjects for book-length
studies in the United States (books had appeared about Chaplin,
but more as a screen persona than as a director).
Aufeur critics searched for the individuality of the director's
style and techniques. "In the kingdom of mechanization," Fran-
cois Truffaut wrote of Nicholas Ray in 1955, "he
is the craftsman."
Prefer Hawks to Ray, Rav to Hawks, or admire them both, said
Truffaut; but
if you reject them both, "Stop going to the cinema,
don 't watch any more films, for you will never know the meaning
of inspiration, of a view-finder, of poetic intention, a frame, a
shot, an idea, a good film, the cinema. An insufferable preten-
sion? No: a wonderful certainty"^
(italics in original).
Not every Hollywood hero of the Cahiers du Cinema critics has
achieved cinematic immortality, nor have the critics' thematic
concerns necessarily persisted. But to a remarkable degree, the
figures in whom thev were interested— rather than, for example,
1950s winners of Academy Awards for directing— are those who
have continued to hold critical attention over the years. Their
nearly exclusive focus on directors has been considerably revised,
however; though not discarded as a concept, the idea of the
director as auteur has been modified by greater awareness of
industrial modes of production, studio practices, and the preva-
lence of genres. Yet, as Rivette wrote in 1955, "we see the
majority of young film-makers passing with equal facility from
one genre to another, without paying much attention to their par-
ticular rules and conventions, and dealing with strongly analogous
themes of their own choosing. ...
It
is still better simply to trust
the credits to know where you are."'
Howard Hawks
Hawks's key films of the 1950s, for example, were a musical.
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (19531, and a Western, Rio Bravo
(1959). In the musical, starring Marilyn Monroe and )ane Russell,
Hawks shifted his long-term interest in male friendships to a
friendship between women. Though Monroe and Russell gave
exceptional performances, they were treated as icons of female
beauty, and their goals were represented as wealth and marriage
(the film derived from a stage musical and a 1920s novel by Anita
Loos, who created Monroe's character, Lorelei Lee, and her
maxim, "Diamonds are a girl's best friend"). In the Western, star-
ring John Wayne as a sheriff. Hawks presented a counter-version
of High Noon's treatment of the lone law enforcer and his
community. The director's concern with the way men form rela-
tionships with women and with other men repeats themes— and
dialogue— from his Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and To Have
and Have Not (1944). Out of a sardonic approach to genre formu-
las and a capacity to elicit exceptional performances from his
players. Hawks managed to shape a genre work that is simultane-
ously conventional and original.
Alfred Hitchcock
Hitchcock's major works of the 1950s era were Rear Window,
Verf/go(1958), North by Northwest (}959), and Psycho. Each fits
into a genre framework: respectivelv, crime, detective, espionage,
and horror. Yet they all raise issues that are more common to each
other than to their different genres, particularly self-reflexive ques-
tions about looking: what
it means to use a camera or to be a
spectator, a voyeur who sees while unobserved. None of the films
is successfully reducible to brief summary' {Rear Window: an

Nicholas Ray
Ray's films of the 1950s included Rebel Without a Cause and
Bigger Than Life
1 1956i. A director who emerged after World War
II,
in contrast to silent cinema veterans Hawks and Hitchcock,
Ray helped to develop new perspectives on the family melodrama
genre. Rebel Without a Cause showcases the most important
performance of James Dean i1931-1955i, who was killed in an
automobile crash before the film was released; with only three
film roles, he became an enduring cinema legend. Dean's por-
trayal of Jim Stark, a troubled adolescent searching for the way to
become a man, influenced later views not only of the actor but of
the era. In Bigger Than Life Ray dramatized the pressures that led
a school teacher to abuse a medical drug and develop aggressive
delusions of grandeur. Ray, said studio publicity for the picture,
was "a man keenly interested in the neurosises of our time.

Hollywood was, inevitably, a cinema of genres. Auteur cnUchm,
focused at first solely on directors, eventually gave way to a more
comprehensive view of the varied creative contributions to film-
making: individual artistry in the context of industrial codes and
generic conventions. Though the films and filmmakers Hollywood
honored were not the ones French critics praised, as we have
seen, Hollywood's prize ceremonies of the 1950s did strongly
emphasize the principle of collaborative endeavor. In the 1930s
except when a historic blockbuster like Cone with the Wind
(1939) swept the boards— major awards normally were shared
among a number of films.
In the 1950s, with fewer productions,
and even fewer successes, top films tended more to dominate,
bringing a full range of creative effort into the limelight.

Although most filmgoers readily form
opinions about acting, the subject ot per-
formance
is one of the least analyzed
aspects of film aesthetics. What exactly
do actors contribute to film artistry, and
how do they do
it? Lee Strasberg
(1899-1982), a teacher and theorist of
acting and a leader of the Actors Studio,
suggested that the most effective film
performers were those w ho did not act.
'The\
try not to act but to be themselves,
to respond or react," he said.
This mav be a debatable proposition
in
the sense that performers' images and
roles are invariablv constructed b\ such
factors as studio publicitv and genre
codes, but
it does relate to a central tenet
of the Stanislavski method: actors were
not to emote in the traditional manner of
stage conventions, but to speak and ges-
ture in a manner one would use in private
life. Konstantin Stanislavski, who was a
director at the Moscow Art Theatre, wrote
a number of books on acting, the first of
which. An Actor Prepares, was published
in English translation in 1936. Before
then, however, one of his students,
Richard Boleslawsky (1889-1937),
opened an acting school in New York and
began teaching Stanislavskian principles
(Boleslavsky went on to HolKwood and
directed a number of films in the 1930s).

The first significant performance work
drawing on Stanislavski's ideas was car-
ried out by the Group Theatre, formed in
New York in 1931. The Croup's most
famous production was a play expressing
the militant radical spirit of the 1930s,
Waiting for /.e^fy (1935), by Clifford
Odets (1903-1963), who became a
Hollvwood scriptwriter and occasional
director. The Group did not last beyond
the 1930s, but
its influence continued in
Hollywood and through the formation of
the Actors Studio.
After World War
II, in the context of
the Actors Studio, the Stanisia\ski method
was shorn of its radical political conno-
tations (the Group Theatre became a
particular target of anticommunist
investigators) and emphasized an indi-
\ iduaiized, psychological approach to
acting. The "Method" required a per-
former to draw on his or her own self, on
experiences, memories, and emotions
that could inform a characterization and
shape how a character might speak or
move. Characters were thus shown to
have an interior life; rather than being
stereotvped figures representing a single
concept (the villain, the heroine), they
could become complex human beings
with multiple and contradictory- feelings
and desires.
It was the ability to convey
the complexity— indeed the confusion
of inner feelings that made the Actors
Studio-trained Marlon Brando,
Montgomery Clift, and James Dean such
emblematic figures for the postwar era.

nations overall. Director Elia Kazan (b.
190')) had been a founder
in 1947 of the Actors Studio in New York, where performers were
trained in a "Method" based on the precepts of Russian stage
director Konstantin Stanisiavski (1863-1938). The Method was an
introspective, psychological style,
in which actors were asked to
build on their own past experience in portraying characters'
emotions. Montgomery ("lift, lames Dean, and Marlon Brando (b.
1924) were the most famous Method actors, and their film perfor-
mances revealed a male figure who was rebellious but insecure,
lacking conviction, searching for the wellspring of honor and
courage. Brando won the acting Oscar as the star of On the
Waterfront. Another Actors Studio performer, Eva Marie Saint
(b. 1924), won as supporting actress, and, as a remarkable tribute
to the richness of performance in the film, three players were
nominated
in the supporting actor category, Lee

even more attention, however, as a parable of Hollywood's politi-
cal travails. Brando's character, Terry Ma Hoy,

teers before a crime commission. Three principals of On the

including such others as Bend of the River i^952), The Naked
Spur(1953), and The Far Country {]955). All except Man of the
VVesf starred James Stewart, an actor transfornning his screen per-
sona from the gentle domestic figure of the 1930s and 1940s into
the violent, driven protagonist of Mann's Westerns, who after
considerable travail found reconciliation with the social commu-
nity.
In films such as The Naked Spur Mann constructed what
seemed almost chamber dramas of psychological intensity, but set
in outdoor Western landscapes with the characters rendered small
in deep-space cinematography.
After his cavalry trilogy of 1948-50 (Fort Apache, She Wore a
Yellow Ribbon, Rio Grande), John Ford, the ranking master of the
Western genre, made few Westerns over the next decade, though
he was to return memorably to the genre in the 1960s. However,
The Searchers (1956),
little noticed on
its release, has become in
later critical appraisal one of his most important films and a major
influence on younger directors.
It was Ford's most psychological
Western. John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, like Stewart's charac-
ters an obsessed, bitter figure, searching over years for a niece
kidnapped by Comanches. Having articulated
in Fort Apache
(and as he would again do in the 1962 film The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance) the necessity of preserving the legends of the
West, even when the narrative demonstrates that they are false,
Ford
in The Searchers allowed the narrative to make
its own
unimpeded critique of Western myths.
Its deepest poignancy
derives from Wayne's portrayal of Edwards as a man whose
heroism
is both product and cause of a social estrangement
that cannot be undone. At the end, a closing door separates
Edwards from the family he has helped to reunite, as he stands
awkwardly,
left hand gripping right elbow (a gesture he borrowed
from an actor in silent Westerns, linking his lonely figure to genre
tradition).
The Musical
After
its successes of the 1946-52 period, the musical began to
fade in importance during the later 1950s. The MCM Freed unit
made fewer films—Vincente Minnelli became interested in melo-
drama. Gene Kelly diversified into dramatic roles, and Fred
Astaire,
still a remarkable dancer, was nevertheless past fifty. The
genre shifted away from dance-oriented productions toward films
exploiting popular singing stars like Elvis Presley (1935-1977).
Minnelli nevertheless made several important traditional musi-
cals, including The Band Wagon (1953), with Astaire and Cyd
Charisse (b. 1921
), and the enormously popular Cigi (1958),
based on a novel by Colette, and starring French performers Leslie
Caron (b. 1931
), Louis Jourdan (b. 1919), and Maurice Chevalier
(1888-1972). Gigi won the Academy Award as best picture,
Minnelli won his only Oscar as director, and the film earned more
than any other Freed unit production. Like On the Waterfront
it
was also a collaborative triumph, with ten awards (matched by
1961 's best picture, IVesf Side Story, the dance musical's last
hurrah).
Film Noir
In an era of more spacious screens and more frequent color, the
film noir movement held true to its dark, constrained mise-
en-scene,
its representation of the night world. But such films
appeared less often
in the 1950s and with a change of focus.
Stories of restless men beguiled by femme fatales gave way to
more institutional contexts, with narratives of key 1950s films cen-
16.21.

tering on police. Cold War, and nuclear themes— and bad women
trying harder to be good. Fritz Lang, who was an instigator of the
movement at the end of World War
II and marked
its strong link
to pre-1933 German cinema, directed one of its memorable works
in The Big Heaf (1953). The protagonist
is a policeman fighting
corruption
in the force and police complicity with the mob. After
his wife
is murdered in a bomb attack meant for him, he
is aided
by the ex-girlfriend of a mobster, disfigured when the thug threw
scalding coffee in her face. They form a tenuous connection that
explores the moral ambiguities of character and behavior, as each
discovers unexplored capacities, his for violence, hers for justice.
Samuel Fuller (b. 1911
), a skilled director of action films in several
genres, contributed a typically idiosyncratic work to the film noir
movement with Pickup on South 5freef (1953). A pickpocket on a
subway train steals the wallet of a woman who (unwittingly)
is
carrying communist espionage microfilm, while the FBI trails her.
Agents for both sides need to find the criminal and recover the
stolen goods. The film both exploits and undercuts cold war
mentality in
its juxtaposition of official and criminal codes of
behavior. "Don't you know what treason means?" an agent asks
the pickpocket, when he
is found. "Who cares?"
is his answer.
Director Fuller and actor Richard Widmark (b. 1914) make a case
for the character's defiant selfhood that the individual, rather than
the state, seems better able to protect.
Robert Aldrich (1918-1983) turned the perspective on
its head
in Kiss Me Deadly (1955), featuring the sensationally violent fic-
357

tional detective hero of the 1950s, Mike Hammer, created by
novelist Mickey Spillane. Aldrich kept Hammer's violence and his
rough appeal to women (Ralph Meeker played the role) but made
him a figure lacking knowledge of himself or the world in his
encounter with criminals making off with "the Great Whatsit," a
metaphorical box of nuclear material. The film
is an exemplar of
what the individual artist can bring to a modest work whose pur-
pose was to transfer popular literature into popular film— it
explores the ambiguous status of high culture in the shadow of

nuclear apocalvpse, signaled bv the conflagration with which the
film ends, and in which the hero either does or does not succumb
(there are two versions of the ending).
The last significant work of the film noir movement (leaving
aside later revivals or homages) was Orson Welles's Touch of Evil
(1958). Welles had not directed a film
in the United States in a
decade, and the opportunity he was given bv Universal Studios to
direct what was regarded as a genre feature again sheds light on
the relation of individual artistry to industrial practice.
Recognized as a gifted collaborator as well as a one-man show,
Welles worked with the studio's regular talent in cinematography,
art direction, set decoration, and costumes, and created a dark,
foreboding mise-en-scene quite unlike the studio's brightly
lighted, spacious, widescreen color pictures on which his collabo-
rators usually worked. Set at the Mexican-United States border,
the film brings racial themes into film noir, along with a self-
reflective concern with vision, spectatorship, and voyeurism in
the Hitchcock manner.

r
aence rictton
The revival of the science fiction genre in
the 1950s gave plenty of opportunities to
special effects cinematographers and
their coworkers. Science fiction films
began dominating the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Oscars
for special effects, which previously had
been awarded mainly to war films. The
winner in 1949 was Mighty joe Young,
a giant-gorilla film from Ernest B.
Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper, who
had also made King Kong, and
in 1950
the award went to Destination Moon
(1950), one of the first of the space travel
films, shot in Technicolor.
Other science fiction winners in the
1950s were When Worlds Collide (1951
),
The War of the Worlds (1953), 20,000
Leagues under the Sea (1954), and The
Time Machine {]9bO). Nominated films
included Them! 0954), Forbidden Planet
(1956), and Journey to the Center of the
Earth (1959). Beginning in 1963 the spe-
cial effects award was divided into visual
effects and sound effects.
Science fiction films of the 1950s used
the standard techniques of special effects
cinematographers and artists, such as
miniature sets, matte paintings, model
figures, and stop-action shooting. One
innovation of the 1950s was the blue
screen process, a kind of colored back-
ground that made possible more effective
composite shots (for example, combining
live action, miniatures, and matte back-
grounds in the same shot) in the color
films that were beginning to be made
with more frequency.
L. B. "Bill" Abbott (b. 1908), a veteran
special effects cameraman and director of
photography who headed the special
effects department at Twentieth Century-
Fox from 1957 to 1972, published a
detailed account of how effects are
achieved in the book Special Effects—
Wire, Tape and Rubber Band Style
(1984). For Journey to the Center of the
Earth, for example, he recounts how live
rhinoceros iguanas, about twenty-four
inches long, with specially made sails
glued to their backs, were used to portray
prehistoric monsters. Scenes in which
explorers are menaced by the monsters
were made by shooting live performers
and iguanas separately against blue
screens, then putting the shots together
to make a composite of the action.
Abbott also describes creating the
scenes in another important science fic-
tion film of the era. The Day the Earth
Stood Still (1951
),
in which ships from
outer space land
in Washington, D.C.
Putting in the ships was no problem; the
challenge was to show them casting a
shadow when they landed. The miniature
ship would have to be photographed
twice, and
it would have to descend at
the same speed each time. The solution
was found by what Abbott called "the
wire, tape and rubber band method": the
ship was lowered on fine wires and
its
descent regulated by a metronome. Thus
a prop man was able to repeat the move-
ment exactly. A white ship was shot
against a black background, then painted
black and shot against white. These were
optically printed with location footage to
show the saucer-shaped ships landing on
baseball fields behind the White House.

Science Fiction
A rising genre of the era was science fiction. Prior to the 1950s,
the occasional works in this genre tended to deal with new gad-
getry or discoveries of fantastic creatures, like King Kong (1933).
The ever-present Fritz Lang had made the major works of the
genre in the silent era with Metropolis (1927) and a film about a
rocket trip to the moon. Die Frau im Mond {Woman in the Moon,
1929). After World War
II the development of rocketry, interest in
space travel, and concern over the scientific and human conse-
quences of nuclear power led to an upsurge in production of
science fiction films. Many, to be sure, were low-budget cross-
genre horror films for the expanding drive-in theater market, such
as
/ Married a Monster from Outer Space (1958), that survive as
late-night TV cult classics.
Some of the major works of the genre were made with new
technologies:
It Came from Outer Space (1953) in 3-D, wide-
screen, and stereophonic sound; Forbidden P/anef (1956) in
Cinemascope and color; Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) in
SuperScope. This last film was directed by Don Siegel (1912-
360

1991), an action director like Fuller, who crafted a widescreen
film that looked like a dark, claustrophobic film noir. Regarded as
the most enduring 1950s work in the genre
(it was also remade in
1978 by director Philip Kaufman), Body Snatchers depicts aliens
who arrive as pods and take over the bodies of unsuspecting
humans, turning them into zombie-like conformists. The most
eerie aspect of the film
is
its atmosphere of bland normality, as
humanity succumbs without terror or violence;
like a number of
other films in the genre,
in which creatures from outer space or
gigantic insects menace innocent suburbanites. Invasion ot the
Body Snatchers metaphorically explored social anxieties about
Cold War threats to the stabilty of domestic
life.
Family Melodrama
Quite as significant a genre of the 1950s was family melodrama.
Strongly linked to the traditional woman's picture, the 1950s
melodrama differed in being almost solely focused on family
issues— as opposed to, say, single working women or childless
couples. Relations between parents and children, the transmission
of values or authority between generations, came to the forefront
as in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause and Bigger Than Life.

Along with Ray, the directors most closely associated with the
genre were Vincente Minnelli and Douglas Sirk. Sirk, whom we
saw earlier working in Nazi cinema as Detlef Sierck,
left Germany
in 1937 and began directing in Hollywood
in 1943.
In the 1950s,
as a contract director at Universal, he made a series of melodra-
mas including Magnificent Obsession (1954), All That Heaven
/A/Zows (1955), Written on the W/nc/ (1956), and Imitation of Life
(1959)—the first and last of these titles, significantly, remakes of
1930s Universal genre pictures. Working with the same creative
personnel as Welles in Touch of Evil, Sirk devised a mise-en-
scene using nonnaturalist color, distinctive decor, and reflecting
surfaces to create an undertone of disorientation and disturbance
in his portraits of family
life. Key performers included Rock
Hudson (1925-1985), Jane Wyman (b. 1916), and Lana Turner (b.
1920); Dorothy Malone (b. 1925) won an Academy Award as sup-
porting actress for her role in Written on the Wind as the wild
daughter of an oil tycoon.
Minnelli's melodramas included The Cobweb (1956), Some
Came Running (1959), and Home from the
/-//// (1960). Minnelli
also used mise-en-scene to convey psychological moods, as in
the garish colors and moving camera of the carnival scene in
5ome Came Running. The film, whose main roles were played by
Frank Sinatra (b. 1915), Dean Martin (b. 1917), and Shirley
MacLaine (b. 1934), explores contrasts of class more than do
Sirk's films, presenting in stark terms a gap between cultural
refinement and authentic feelings.

Comedy
No survey of the period's genres
is complete without a look at
comedy, although
it
is true that 1950s comedy has been generally
neglected in critical writing on the era, at least in the United
States. (The split between French and Hollywood perspectives
from the 1950s has subsequently been closed in every respect but
one, the French esteem for comedian Jerry Lewis.) The most sig-
nificant comedy directors were Billy Wilder— in addition to his
work in film noir, just as Minnelli moved between musicals and
melodrama— and Frank Tashlin (1913-1972). Wilder's most
important comedy of the decade was Some Like It Hot {^959),
with Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis (b. 1925), and Jack Lemmon
(b. 1925); one of the most daring works on gender identity in
Hollywood history,
it featured Curtis and Lemmon posing as
women in a generic, comic, and fantasized framework.
A one-time cartoon director, Tashlin became a scriptwriter in
the 1940s and began directing in the 1950s. He directed the Jerry
Lewis and Dean Martin comedy team
in several of their most
effective works, among them Hollywood or Bust (1956). Tashlin
parodied contemporary culture, including the film industry itself.

Hollywood's obsession with well-proportioned blondes, personi-
fied in the film by Jayne Mansfield (1933-1967), and the film
industry's anxiety about television. Actor Tony Randall interrupts
the narrative partway through to address the audience: "Ladies
and gentlemen, this break in our motion picture
is made out of
respect for the TV fans in our audience, who are accustomed to
constant interruptions in their programs for messages from spon-
sors. We want all you TV fans to feel at home and not forget the
thrill you get from watching television on your big 21 -inch
screen." As he speaks the widescreen CinemaScope color image
shrinks drastically to the size of a television screen, whose black-
and-white image then begins a vertical
roll. "Picture trouble," says
Randall.
Poking fun at television was good for laughs, and for morale,
but
it did nothing to alter the movement of audiences away from
movies to the small screen,
first in the United States and then
elsewhere as television broadcasting expanded. The revival of
cinema
in the 1960s and beyond would be initiated not in the
major film industries but from their challengers, even though
mainstream filmmaking would eventually be a beneficiary.

what constitutes a film movement? How do they
I
begin, and what are their characteristics? Film
I
historians rarely raise such questions, because
the issues and criteria are not very clear. Yet a
number of film movements are recognized: Soviet cinema of the
1920s; the cinema of Weimar Germany in the same era; Italian
neorealism after World War
II. They are marked by a burst of cre-
ativity by filmmakers working generally in close proximity and
broadly sharing distinctive styles, techniques, and aesthetic val-
ues. They seem to emerge in the context of dramatic social and
political transformations: respectively,
in the movements cited,
the Russian revolution, Germany's defeat in World War
I,
Italy's
liberation after World War
II. Film noir in Hollywood might be
considered a film movement, and others outside Europe and
North America not yet sufficiently known—such as the upsurge
in Chinese filmmaking during the
1 930s—may someday be
added to the
list.
In the late 1950s a new film movement suddenly broke onto
the scene in world cinema: the French nouvelle vague, or New
Wave. There
is little question that the New Wave fits the criteria
of a film movement, yet
its contradictory aspects were also
apparent.
It was a national movement of French filmmakers, but
its development as part of international art cinema helped to give
it recognition and support.
It exalted notions of cinematic artistry,
yet
it also aimed for popular commercial success.
It was a move-
ment that simultaneously asserted and shared
its distinctiveness.
The name
is significant: neorealism will always carry the label
Italian neorealism no matter where
it
is practiced, while the
French New Wave fostered "new waves" in other countries, and
the name remains open for future appropriation.
What was most unusual about the French New Wave was that
it was a movement made by figures known as critics before they
were widely recognized as filmmakers. Some of their names are
already familiar (see Chapter
1 6) as writers who shaped a new
perspective on
1 950s Hollywood film in the pages of Cahiers du
Cinema: Frangois Truffaut; Jacques Rivette; Eric Rohmer; Claude
Chabrol. They wrote criticism because
it furthered their goals,
while at the same time they directed short films and photo-
graphed, edited, performed
in, and publicized each other's film
work. With a few others—most notably Jean-Luc Godard,
another Cahiers critic—they became the directors of the New
Wave.
CRITIQUE OF
FRENCH CINEMA
Though the critic-filmmakers of Cahiers wrote frequently about
Hollywood directors, their primary concern was the situation of
filmmaking in France. Their position was put most forcefully by
Truffaut in a 1954 article, "A Certain Tendency of the French
Cinema."' Truffaut attacked what he regarded as the dominant
French film practice of the time: literary adaptations in which the
screenplay took artistic precedence over the director's work. This
"Tradition of Quality" was,
in his view, a writers' cinema twice
over, because
it favored both the writer of the source text and the
366

writer of the screenplay. Yet he challenged the idea that this
practice treated the original literary text with "faithfulness."
If a
literary scene was considered "unfilmable," he wrote,
it was
rewritten for the screen, rather than trying to find a way to
express
its meaning visually.
In general, Truffaut's view was that
French film was long on dialogue, short on attention to visual
effects and to mise-en-scene. His solution was to take cinema out
of the hands of litterateurs— literary people—and give
it to film
directors who were auteurs, whose creative efforts focused on
film technique. This argument came to be called the politique
des auteurs,
literally " a ufeur policy," more often rendered in
English as "aufeur theory." Among the auteurs Truffaut cited were
not only Hollywood directors but the French filmmakers )ean
Renoir, Robert Bresson, and Jacques Tati, among others.
Truffaut and his colleagues were remarkably successful, from a
critical standpoint,
in their attack on the dominant French cin-
ema: in subsequent decades, few films associated with the
"Tradition of Quality" have circulated widely and few filmmakers
other than those approved by Cahiers du Cinema have received
much critical attention. Many other writers at the time,
it
is true,
substantially shared the critique of contemporary French films.
Even a film that was hailed as a masterpiece when
it first
appeared, Les Jeux interdits (Forbidden Cames, 1952), directed
THE NEWWAVE BEGINS
The New Wave phenomenon was not greeted with praise in
every quarter. The filmmakers were subjected to the same kind of
polemical attacks they had launched as writers. "The French New
Wave was less a movement than a situation," British critic Ian
Cameron gave a retrospective dismissal; "for a year or two, con-
ditions favored the emergence of new directors willing to work
on frequently illusory budgets at a time when the established
heavyweights were producing poor results."' Within France their
detractors called them unpolitical and self-
promotional, accommodating to producers by working cheap.
Moreover,
it was said—accurately—that the New Wave label had
come to encompass a wide variety of filmmakers who had
little
to do with the core of ex-critics.
No new movement arrives without criticism, as the histories of
neorealism and of Soviet filmmaking of the
1 920s make amply
clear. But the era was disposed toward a fresh vision such as the
New Wave offered. Truffaut (1932-1984), Codard (b. 1930), and
Chabrol (b.
1 930) were under thirty years of age when their first
films made them internationally prominent. They brought to the
screen the perspectives of the generation that came of age after
the war.
N EW WAVE
by Rene Clement (b.
1 91 3), has fallen sharpiv in esteem, on the
grounds that
it
is compromised by an overly literary screenplay.
This neglect of French films of the
1 950s almost certainly
requires some correction, not necessarily to revive the reputation
of the "Tradition of Quality," but to rediscover some important
works by filmmakers such as Jean Renoir and Max Ophuls
(1 902-1 957), the German emigre director who worked in France
after 1933, Hollywood in the 1940s, and France again in the
1950s.
One director who merits renewed attention
is Jean-Pierre Mel-
ville (1 91 7-1 973), whose Bob le tiambeur (Bob the Gambler,
1956) was an inspiration to New Wave directors. Translating a
Hollywood film noir ambience into a Parisian milieu, the film
was a low-budget triumph, with deft cinematography and the
gradually accelerating pace of a thriller.
Its narrative of an old-
time bank robber, out of prison, who gets involved in one last big
heist has similarities to the Raoul Walsh film High Sierra (1 941
),
starring Humphrey Bogart; but Melville shaped a comedy of
manners, as he called
it, rather than a gangster elegy. However,
the director faulted the film on the grounds that he was forced to

"I can't look at Bob le flambeur any more,"
he later said, "and
it
is because of this dialogue, which has aged
terribly."^ Truffaut used Melville's cinematographer (Henri Decae)
and one of his main performers (Guy Decomble) in his first film,
Les Quatre cents coups
( The 400 Blows,
1 959); and in Godard's
debut, A Bout de souffle (Breathless,
1 960), besides sly textual
references to Bob le flambeur, Melville himself was cast as a nov-
elist in an airport interview scene.

Hiroshima, mon amour
The film that restored international attention to French cinema,
preparing the way for the others, was Hiroshima, mon amour.
Given the differences in age and experience between Resnais
and the Cahiers critics-turned-directors, his position as a New
Wave figure has often been questioned. Nevertheless, Resnais
welcomed association with the New Wave, however distinctive
his filmmaking style was from others in the movement. A film-
maker since his teen-age years, he worked in the 1950s as a film
editor and made short documentaries, among them a famous
meditation on the Auschwitz concentration camp, Nuit et
brouillard (Night and Fog,
1 955), that
is closely related to
Hiroshima, mon amour. Resnais was a director for whom the
war still shaped postwar consciousness.
Hiroshima, mon amour was regarded by contemporary critics
and audiences as a landmark in film history, a work of narrative
complexity and philosophical depth such as the cinema had
rarely seen before. With a script by Marguerite Duras, a novelist
and later herself a film director, the film was partly grounded in
the literary approach of the "Tradition of Quality," but Resnais
transformed this emphasis by using a visual style that often played
against the words, utilizing long tracking shots and tight close-
ups familiar from his documentary work. The narrative concerns a
French actress who has an affair with a Japanese man while she
is in Japan to appear in a film about the dropping of the first
atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Rooted in this personal relationship,
its emotions and conversations, are subjects considerably more
vast: history and memory, document and fiction, perception and
visualization, the status of film as a depiction of actuality. An
allusive film, austere and cryptic,
it raises questions about indi-
viduality and identity in a way that film theory would pursue in
the coming decades: what
is human subjectivity, how
is
it
formed? "The art of seeing has to be learned," the actress says,
acknowledging that perception
is a socially based activity. This
profound film suggests how images and utterances both lie and
tell the truth (to paraphrase a line of dialogue), and leaves the
spectator to ponder the consequences of that ambiguity.
The 400 Blows
As a critic Frangois Truffaut had attacked the "Tradition of Qual-
ity"; his first feature film. The 400 Blows, showed an allegiance
to the visual style of filmmakers such as Jean Renoir and Orson
Welles, emphasizing moving camera shots and long takes to
create an open, fluid (what Andre Bazin had called "realist")
mise-en-scene. Perhaps
its strongest affinity was to the films of
Jean Vigo: to the oppressive yet absurd worlds of school and
adults in Zero de conduite, to the joys of popular culture in A
Propos de Nice and L'Atalante.
Its narrative roots were autobio-
graphical: the travails of his young protagonist Antoine Doinel
were close to Truffaut's own. Precocious founder of a cine-club
as a teen-ager, Truffaut had been jailed because of his failure to
pay debts and was released only through the intervention of
Bazin (to whom the film
is dedicated). In the film, Antoine

The h^oraotten
a
French filmmaking of the
1 950s has not
recovered
its reputation from the assault
upon
it by the critics of Cahiers du
Cinema. Waiting to make their break-
through as directors of the New Wave,
they attacked the films of many of their
predecessors as stuffy, wordy, out of
touch—elegant perhaps, but empty. The
critique was so effective that
it has
largely eclipsed the era from historical
view, including the works of filmmakers
whom the New Wave directors admired.
Even the 1950s films of Jean Renoir
the one French "father" whom the New
Wave was willing to acknowledge—have
suffered from this general devaluation.
After leaving France in
1 940 and working
in hlollywood during and after the war,
Renoir did not make a film in France
until French CanCan (1955; the original
title was in English). This was followed by
Elena et les hommes (literally "Elena and
the Men," released
in English as Paris
Does Strange Things, 1956). Instead of
focusing on contemporary society, as in
Renoir's celebrated
1 930s works, these
were period films, both set in the 1880s;
though lavishly praised by New Wave
figures, to others they seemed artificial
and nostalgic, and over the years critics
have generally regarded them with per-
plexity or indifference. They deserve
reconsideration; just as with the revalua-
tion of 1950s Hollywood family
melodrama, their visual extravagance
and artifice may be seen as a strategy for
social critique.
Costume films were in vogue in
French 1950s cinema. Max Ophuls, the
German-born director who became a
French citizen
in 1938, then worked in
Hollywood during the 1940s, returned to
France and made several elegant period
works: La Ronde [Rondelay, 1950);
Le Plaisir {House of Pleasure,
1 952);
Madame de
.
. .( The Earrings of Madame
De, 1953); and /.o/a Monfes (1955).
Viewed initially by critics as beautifully
stylized romantic confections, their
underlying seriousness has more recently
been asserted: "Ophuls' cinema," British
critic Raul Willemen has written, "can be
seen as the dramatisation of repression."
Other figures from the era have been
more thoroughly neglected. An example
is Jacques Becker (1906-1960), who had
been Renoir's assistant in the 1930s and
became a director during World War
II.
Though most of his postwar films dealt
with contemporary France, his most
widely known work. Casque d'Or
(Colden Headpiece, 1952), was also a
period film set at the turn of the century.
The filmmakers on whom the Cahiers
critics centered their opprobrium were
Rene Clement and Claude Autant-Lara
(b. 1903), considered the leading figures
of the era's "Tradition of Quality." More
recently, critic Richard Roud proposed
giving them a fresh evaluation by looking
at what he regarded as their outstanding
works of the decade: for Clement,
Monsieur RIpols (known in English as
Knave of Hearts or Lovers, Happy Lovers,
1954), made in Britain; for Autant-Lara,
La Traversee de Paris (literally "Crossing
Paris," known in English as Four Bags
Full, 1956), a film set in the occupation
period, which even Francois Truffaut
admitted he admired "without any real
reservations."
jailed for stealing a typewriter and held in a center for delinquent
minors, from which he escapes in order to gain his first glimpse
of the sea.
The performance of adolescent Jean-Pierre Leaud (b.
1 944)
is a
key to the film's success. Crave yet comical, wise yet innocent,
his portrayal of Antoine's initiation into a world of callousness
and betrayal gives the film's banal events an exceptional pathos.
A freeze frame on Antoine's face by the sea closes the film and
leaves the future open; over the next two decades spectators got
the opportunity to observe the growth of this character and per-
former in four other appearances of Antoine Doinel.''
Breathless
Even with the critical acclaim for Resnais's and Truffaut's films,
it
was Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless that became the New Wave's
emblematic film, assuring the movement's place in cinema his-
tory and legend. In retrospect the differences seem self-evident,
and perhaps they did at the time: Hiroshima, man amour and
The 400 Blows are concerned with the past, as history, memory,
or autobiography. Breathless caught the moment. Besides
its
intellectual and aesthetic resonances,
it gave spectators opportu-
nities for identification and fantasy.
It blatantly espoused
its alle-
giance to Hollywood commercial cinema, while at the same time
radically challenging conventional narrative codes through jump
cuts (cuts that break temporal continuity in a scene by leaving
gaps in time) and extended long takes shot with a hand-held
camera. Breathless was "trendy" not in the sense of following
fashion but in taking strands of contemporary culture—popular
cinema, existentialism—and shaping them into an artistic cre-
ation that was simultaneously derivative and new. Looking
back with a later era's vocabulary, some critics have called
it
postmodern.
Performance and characterization play key roles in the film's
effects. Jean-Paul Belmondo (b. 1933) as the small-time hood
Michel Poiccard and Jean Seberg (1938-1979) as Patricia Fran-
chini, an American girl in Paris, are both young people searching
for authenticity and a role in
life. He copies the gestural manner-
isms of Humphrey Bogart, commits petty crimes, and in a
spontaneous existentialist moment murders a policeman. She
is
the quintessential American ingenue abroad, at once naive and
rock hard, teetering between respectable ambition and wild
adventure, which may otherwise be a way to improve her French.

The narrative enfolds as
if arbitrary, yet has the fateful inevitabil-
ity of a film noir thriller.
The formulaic aspects of characterization and narrative were,
in a way, the underpinning and counterpoint of the film's chal-
lenge to conventional film style. Breathless put the term jump cut
into the everyday language of film technique. Jump cuts disori-
ented the spectator, leaving gaps in movement and camera
placement. This break with standard shot continuity practice was
aimed at keeping viewers attuned to the movement of performers
and the vantage point from which the camera observed them.
Jump cuts, like virtually every technique, go back a long way in
cinema history (Orson Welles used a version of jump cutting, for
example, in Citizen Kane), but Codard gave them more promi-
nence than ever before, with continual surprises for spectators.
Breathless made the New Wave synonymous with stylistic rule-
breaking, a cinema of the unexpected.
Claude Chabrol
Chabrol launched his directing career earlier than Truffaut or
Godard,
in 1958, and he quickly moved into a commercial film-
making mode. His specialty was the thriller, with a particular
twist. Almost invariably
it involved a surprise murder in which
intimacy played a part, with the spectator invited to sympathize
more with the plight of the murderer than of the victim. His
visual style, shaped in his
first four films with cinematographer
Henri Decac (of Boh Ic thmbcur anc\ The 400 Blows), empha-
sized a kind of heightened realism, a view of urban space that
seems almost documentary yet grows increasingly dark and
disorienting through the events that occur within
it.
' Chabrol
developed a following among filmgocrs who responded to his

stark pessimism, while others deplored what thev saw as a con-
descending amoralism.
His fourth film, Les Bonnes Femmes (I960), was typically con-
troversial. The title literallv means The Good Women," but can
also suggest "The Credulous Women." Four voung women work
in a shop and yearn tor something to happen in their lives. The
men the\ meet are boring or obnoxious, except tor a m\'sterious
motorcyclist who follows the most sh\ woman. He rescues her in
a swimming pool incident and takes her to the country', and they
appear to fall in love. Then he strangles her. The last shot of the
film
is of another woman, dancing w ith a man whose face we
cannot see, and staring into the camera. In Les Bonnes femmes,
women lead hapless or endangered lives, while men are jerks or
killers—perhaps both at once.
Jacques Demy
Jacques Demy (1931-19901 had no direct connection to the
Cahiers critics, but his first feature, Lola (1961
), was immediately
tagged \\ ith the New Wa\'e label. To be sure, this was not entirely
w ithout premeditation on the director's part. The film opens
under the titles w ith shots of a man driving a white Cadillac con-
vertible with the top down: this car had alread\ become a New
Wave signature w ith appearances in Breathless and Les Bonnes
Femmes. A suggestion
is made to a character that he make
friends. He replies (in the English subtitles',
"1 had one. Poiccard.
Cot himself shot," a reference to Belmondo's character in
Breathless. Codard's cinematographer Raoul Coutard shot the
film. In
its fair\ -tale fantas\ of fate and coincidence, w ith a happy
ending for the title character, Lola had
little in common with the
films of Truffaut, Godard, or Chabrol. Nevertheless, Anouk
Aimee (b. 19321 in the role of Lola, dressed like her namesake
Lola-Lola of The Blue Angel in a lacy costume with a dark feather
boa, became an icon of New Wave imager\', along with Leaud
and Belmondo.
Jacques Rivette

two vears awa\' from release. The narrative centers on a woman
pursuing information about a mysterious death that others think
may be related to a worldwide fascist conspiracx'. At the end the
conspiracv turns out to be another character's paranoiac delu-
sion. "Modern art is in a phase in which each work
is a searching
which ends by destroying itself," a Cahiers critic wrote, "and that
is whv Rivette's Paris nous appartient is the most significant and
most resoluteK modern work of the new cinema."" This was a
generous assessment. Rivette himself retrospectively made a
telling appraisal. "The stvie of the dialogue and the resulting stvie
of acting bother me prodigiousK," he told interviewers some
years later. Though he thought at the time he was overturning the
"Tradition of Qualit\," he realized he had done "the same thing
dialogue for effects,
in the worst sense of the term."
By this he
meant dialogue taking precedence o\er visual style, rather than a
d\ namic relationship between language and images.
FRENCH FILM IN THE 1960S
After
its triumphs of 1959-60 the French New Wave was firmly
established as an international phenomenon, regarded by many
filmgoers as setting a new direction for cinema art. But in what
sense did
it hold together as a movement, after the "situation"
that had launched
it was over? As we have noted, earlier film
movements had been closelv linked to social transformations,
which were prominent as subjects in their films. However, New
Wave films seemed more about cinema than society. With their
variety and ambiguous relationship to commercial film conven-
tions, thev carried forward the term New V\'ave more as a brand
name than as a banner. By the early
1 960s
it was possible to
regard the New Wave as the next wave of international art
cinema.

Frangois Truffaut
Truffaut's development illustrates the shift from New Wave chal-
lenge against cinematic orthodoxies to a secure place within an
established filmmaking practice. After The 400 Blows he turned
to a thriller novel by American writer David Coodis as source for
Tirez sur le pianiste {Shoot the Piano Player,
1 960). Early in
1 962
he released another film based on a novel, Jules et Jim (Jules and
Jim). These two films are perhaps the most highly acclaimed of
Truffaut's career, surpassing in critical reputation any of the works
he was to make over the next two decades.
For both films Truffaut utilized Godard's cinematographer
Raoul Coutard, who helped to shape a visual style based on free-
flowing camera movement. At the same time, contrasting to but
also working in conjunction with Coutard's camera work, both
films gave prominence to verbal language,
in extensive voice-
over commentaries—the characters' inner thoughts in Shoot the
Piano Player, an omniscient third-person narrator in Jules and
Jim—and in story-telling monologues within the film action.
These uses of language gave the films a contemplative atmos-
phere, lulling and distancing the spectator into a false sense of
ease just as the narratives turn toward violent action.
This capacity for incongruous juxtaposition was a hallmark of
Truffaut's style. Shoot the Piano Player has bumbling criminals
and corny jokes. A crook
is telling a tall tale about his scarf being
made of metal and says,
"I swear on my old lady's head. May she
die
if
I lied." Immediately there
is a shot of a woman keeling over
(unusually shaped as an oval
iris to give
it the look of a silent
comedy gag). Yet our laughter at this comic death
is undercut by
knowledge of senseless deaths that have occurred in the narra-
tive, and the possibility of the crook's murderous intent.
B(jth films, but especially Jules and Jim in the performance of
Jeanne Moreau (b. 1928), also demonstrate Truffaut's ability to
create portraits of emotionally complex women with whom spec-
tators could empathize. (New Wave films in general are open to
criticism for disdainful treatment of women characters: for exam-
ple, the self-centered American girl |)layed by jean Seberg in
Breathless; the aimless and gullible shopgirls of Les Bonnes
Femmcs; the complaisant dancers/prostitutes of Lola.) Yet
^^'
Truffaut's more appealing figures, Lena (played by Marie Dubois)
in Shoot the Piano Player and Moreau's Catherine, die at the end
of their respective films.
A spectator who saw Jules and Jim without knowing the history
of the previous decade's critical polemics might be surprised to
learn that
its director had excoriated the "Tradition of Quality"
in
French cinema,
its emphasis on poetic dialogue and literary allu-
sion,
its psychological realism,
its treatment of bourgeois lives,
all
seem to locate the film well within the framework of the tradition
Truffaut condemned. Critics who regard Jules and Jim as the
fulfillment of a New Wave aesthetic speak of
its "vitality" and
"feeling" in contrast to 1950s films and even other New Wave
works. Yet from a stylistic viewpoint, this seems to be a case of a
revolution incorporating what
it has overturned.

The film carried forward the movement of Antonioni's
L'Avventura toward avant-garde exploration within the framework
of commercial feature filmmaking. Utilizing a script by Alain
Robbe-Grillet ib. 1922i, like Marguerite Duras a novelist who
would become a filmmaker, Resnais further examined the issues
of memory and perception within a more abstract,
anti-realist visual and narrative st\ie. In a palace-like hotel
sumptuously photographed in widescreen black-and-white by
Sacha Vierny, and with all the performers in formal dress, a man
tries to persuade a woman that they had had an affair the year
before and she had promised to leave her husband and go away
with him. Characters move and talk while others stand frozen.
Jump cuts show the woman standing in the same position but in
different clothes. These visual devices raise questions about what
spectators are seeing— is
it past or present, dream or projection,
his perception or hers? Language
is repeated over and over, and
organ music on the soundtrack lends a melodramatic urgency.
Last Year at Marienbad engrosses the viewer in
its philosophical
puzzles.
Agnes Varda
Among directors whose careers were boosted by the New Wave's
success was Agnes Varda (b.
1 928i. Varda was the first woman
feature film director in France since Cermaine Dulac and joined
the Hollywood actress Ida Lupino (b.
1 916) as the only women
to direct commercial features from World War
II through the
early
1 960s. Because she actually completed her first feature. La
Pointe Courte (named for the fishing village in which
it was shot),
as early as 1955, Varda was sometimes called "mother of the
New Wave," even "grandmother of the New Wave," though she
was the same age as Rivette and onlv ^vo vears older than
Godard and Chabrol.
It took Varda seven years to gain financing for a second feature
(in the interim she made several fiction and documentan,' shorts),
but she became widelv known when Cleo de 5 a 7 iCIeo from 5
to 7, 19621 appeared. Divided into brief "chapters

life of a pop singer who is waiting to hear the results of medical

through the Paris streets.
In a park she meets a soldier about to
return to Algeria to fight
in the French colonial war there; his
proximity to death in war helps to forge a bond between them
that will launch her toward treatment and recovery. With refer-
ences to the Algerian war,
it was one of the few New Wave films
from the period to take notice of contemporary events (historians
are beginning to unearth the censorship policies that prevented
New Wave filmmakers from treating political subjects more
directly).
Varda's Le Bonheur {Happiness, 1965) became a significant
work for the feminist movement emerging in the late 1960s.
Its
focus
is articulated early in the film when a man speaking from a
television screen says, "Happiness may be submitting to the order
of nature." In the context of the film's narrative, "the order of
nature"
is a concept defined by men. A young carpenter has a
happy
life with a wife and two small children, but he takes a
lover and becomes even happier—so much so that he wants to
share his joy by telling his wife, who drowns herself in a pond.
Soon the lover replaces the wife. Varda shows her in a montage
taking on the wifely duties: picking up the kids from school, feed-
ing them and putting them to bed, ironing, maintaining the
house. Shot in color, beginning and ending in beautiful natural
scenery, Le Bonheur suggests that "the order of nature" has been
interpreted to foster men's happiness through women's labors.
Robert Bresson
The New Wave ascendancy also brought added attention to older
filmmakers whom Cahiers critics championed
in the 1950s. This
was particularly the case for Robert Bresson. As interest grew in
distinguishing French filmmaking style from that of Hollywood,
Bresson was acknowledged as a pioneer who, as one critic
wrote, "defined his practice as a break with Hollywood
cinema."" Bresson's practice might be categorized as spare but
unsparing.

he drew the dialogue solely from the texts of Joan's trial and
interrogation, and portrayed the English as cruel instigators of her
martyrdom. In Au hasard Balthazar {^966) the title character
is a
donkey whose life is traced from birth to death. The title might be
translated "The Perils of Balthazar," as the donkey suffers from
many forms of human evil, as do some of the humans in the film,
too. Since many films adopt the visual perspective of their main
protagonist, Au hasard Balthazar ioWows this logic for the don-
key's point of view: much of the work
is photographed at
donkey-eye level, with the first shots of many scenes showing
feet, legs, and torsos before we see people's faces.
JEAN-LUC GODARD
The films of Jean-Luc Godard in the 1960s raise issues that go
considerably beyond the context of the French New Wave: they
are a phenomenon unlike anv other in cinema histor\'. Between
1960 and 1967, after Breathless, Godard directed thirteen fea-
tures plus seven segments in collective projects. The earliest of
these works were slow to make their way into the mainstream of
international cinema, but by the mid-1960s Godard's films had
seized the imaginations of contemporary filmgoers in a manner
different from any before or since. Other filmmakers had been
equally or more prolific, others had put their films forward as cin-
ematic innovation or social commentary, but none had
combined such productivity' with such immediacy. His films were
like bulletins from the battlefront, as audiences eagerly antici-
pated their capacity to render in novel cinematic forms
the exploding transformations of the era.
Yet, with the smoke long cleared from the struggles of the
1960s, a question remains about the lasting status of Godard's
work, other than as symbol and symptom of an age. Perhaps a
price was to be paid for productivity and immediacy: the willing-
ness to report on the contemporar\' whirl had
its costs in depth or
coherence or aesthetic form. Perhaps also what Godard pio-
neered and accomplished has become so widely diffused, so
much a part of common visual experience, that
it
is no longer
easy to recognize in his films the power of novelty that excited
spectators at the time. Since his films are overloaded with self-
reflexive commentary on cinema and the arts, one might l(X)k to
the texts for an aphorism appropriate to the case: in Bande a part
{Band of Outsiders, 1964), a teacher writes on a blackboard,
"classique = moderne" (classical = modern). A student interprets,
"All that
is new
is by that fact automatically traditional."
Godard's filmmaking was the newhat became automatically
traditional. The same kind of claim could be made for him that
had been made for D. W. Griffith half a century earlier: his tech-
niques were not inventions, but he took the innovations of his
time and forged them into a unique style that also became a
touchstone of future film practice. The jump cuts of Breathless
were not as common in subsequent films, but fresh combinations
of techniques marked each new work: the use of the original

writing as significant elements of the text. The growing impor-
tance of structural linguistics and semiotics in French intellectual
life of the 1960s found expression in Godard's emphasis on lan-
guage, from
literar\' quotations to ever\'dav speech on the
soundtrack.

Above all perhaps was the fascination with cinema

is based on the epic Greek poem The Odyssey,
perhaps a parody of the many widescreen epics on classical
themes that the Italian (and Hollywood) film industries were then
producing. There are aphorisms a minute on film history and

Hawks, Hitchcock, Minnelli, Nicholas Ray, Rossellini.

I hear the word culture

suggesting that the effect on culture of gun and checkbook
is sim-
ilar. When he
is introduced as the director of a Western with
Marlene Dietrich (Rancho Notorious, 1952), Lang responds,
"Personally,
I prefer M."

Godard and 1960s Culture
These cinematic references have the effect of distancing the
spectator, providing a regular reminder that one
is watching a
film, but they are not entirely hermetic or self-referential.
Godard's project as
it evolved in the
1 960s linked cinema to a
broad range of social developments. He was among the first film-
makers to explore the consequences of the Baby Boom—the
surge in birthrates after 1945—as those born in the postwar years
became students and workers in the 1960s, integral to his stylis-
tic strategies was the effort to represent new trends in advertising
and consumption, sexual relations, ideologies. His films marked
a response to France's Algerian war and the United States
involvement in Vietnam, the latter well before American film-
makers paid attention. A "chapter" title from Masculin feminin
became famous: "This Film Might Be Called: The Children of
Marx and Coca-Cola."
If Godard's modernism was to become "automatically tradi-
tional," however,
it also broke with the traditional forms of
classical narrative. His films were less narratives than sequences
of fragments, episodes, events, which the chapter divisions, the
self-reflexivity, and the voice-over commentaries were often
designed to emphasize. A paradox of Godard's films
is that their
break with the conventions of cinematic realism
is an effort to
make them more lifelike. The temporal aspect of cinema
is
relaxed and free-flowing in his work. Some of the most memo-
rable scenes are "throw-away" moments, parentheses without
obvious narrative purpose:
in Band of Outsiders when a woman
and her two male friends practice dance steps in a bar, or espe-
cially the sequence of the trio racing through the Louvre to set a
new speed record for art appreciation.

Alphaville
One Codard film from this period that has maintained strong crit-
ical interest
is, also perhaps paradoxically, the most closely
linked to traditional genres. This was Alphavllle ^^965), subtitled
Une Etrarige aventure de Lemmy Caution [A Strange Adventure of
Lemmy Caution). Lemmy Caution was a private detective or gov-
ernment agent in a series of low-budget French thrillers
beginning in 1953, portrayed by Eddie Cor.stantine (1917-1993),
an American expatriate singer turned actor. Constantine's role in
Alpbaville fuses the crime thriller and science fiction genres in a
dystopian film in which the futuristic totalitarian societv ruled bv
the computer "Alpha 60"
is created out of the architecture and
technology of contemporary Paris—and, Codard suggests, the
political tendencies of contemporarv' France. But the film has, for
Codard, an uncharacteristically happy ending as Lemmy rescues
the beautiful heroine portrayed by Anna Karina (b. 1940) and
drives oft to his home galaxy, while upbeat genre music plays
parodically on the soundtrack.
FRENCH CINEMA
AND SOCIETY
New Wave filmmakers besides Codard began to be persuaded
that France was becoming more like "Alphaville." In February
1968 the French government of Charles de Gaulle ousted Henri
Langlois (1914-19771 as director of the Cinematheque Franqaise,
the famous Paris film library. Langlois had founded the Cinema-
theque in 1935; he was one of the inspired film collectors who
have been so important to cinema history, preserving films long
before governments or film companies took an interest, and
teaching the heritage of cinema through screenings of rare works.
New Wave filmmakers called themselves "Children of the Cine-
matheque." The government's action was widely criticized as a
dangerous step toward seizing control over culture.
The Cinematheque Controversy
While filmmakers around the world sent hundreds of telegrams,
demonstrations were held in Paris. On February
14, 1968,
several thousand people on a protest march led by New Wave
filmmakers were blocked bv police, and a number suffered
injuries, including Truffaut and Codard. By April the government
had backed down, and Langlois was restored to his position. A
few weeks later the events of "May '68" began—the student

protests and worker strikes against what was regarded as an auto-
cratic government—that were to reshape French intellectual
life
and profoundly influence film culture and theory. Truffaut later
wrote,
"It seems obvious that the demonstrations for Langlois
were to the events of May '68 what the trailer
is to the feature
film coming soon."'
Weekend
Another preview of coming attractions was Godard's Weekend
(1968), shot in 1967 before the events of February and May
1968. With such films as Made in USA (1966) and La Chinoise
{The Chinese, 1967) Godard had begun to suggest that he had
chosen sides between Marx and Coca-Cola; more precisely, that
he was a child not only of the Cinematheque but also of the
"Little Red Book," the thoughts of Chinese communist chairman
Mao Zedong.
It
is often a mistake to confuse what a filmmaker
puts on screen with what he or she believes. Weekend, however,
does
little to alleviate the confusion.
Wee/cency represents two main subjects: the self-destruction of
middle-class society and a revolutionary struggle against
its polit-
ical and economic institutions. The first half is a surrealistic
treatment of social, moral, and technological breakdown, absurd-
ist and often mordantly funny. A long tracking shot shows a
traffic jam on a country road, with wrecked cars and bodies
strewn on the ground. Strange characters appear from literature
and history, including one who calls himself "God" and
announces "the end of the Grammatical Era and the beginning of
flamboyance in every field—especially the movies." The second
half shifts to tedious voice-overs on political economy and
scenes of a "Liberation Front" operating in the woods outside
Paris. "To overcome the horror of the bourgeoisie you need
still
more horror," says a voice in the film; actual scenes of killing ani-
mals and (presumably) mock scenes of cannibalism either
criticize this view, parody
it, contemplate
it, or endorse
it. Fin de
Cinema (End of the Movies) are the last words on-screen, and the
film did mark for Godard the end of commercial filmmaking for
some time.
Jacques Tati
Another modernist critique of contemporary society appeared
around the same time as Weekend, and from an unexpected
source—Jacques Tati, director/performer of the
1 950s comedy
Mr. Hulot's Holiday. Tati worked nearly ten years on an expen-
sive production. Playtime 0967), which ran for two-and-one-half
hours in
its original release version that was a box office disaster.
Shorter versions later circulated.
In Playtime ihe horrors are of
the spirit. Paris
is portrayed as a city of glass and steel and plastic,
of long blank corridors and bureaucrats in boxy offices. As
it
depicts a group of American tourists on their rounds of the city,
the film suggests that all they get to see of historical Paris
is brief

amlols and the
tnematheqtie
r
j-franaitse
For all the important work that the>' do,
film archivists rarelv become public
celebrities. Henri Langlois was an excep-
tion. He was a legendary figure even
before the French go\emments effort
to remo\e him as head of the
Cinematheque Franqaise led to street
derTK>nstrations that some observers
claim, sparked the student and worker
revolts of May
1 968 in France.
Born in Turke\ to French parents,
Langlois mo\ed to F^ris in the early
1920s and began in his teens to attend
screenings at cine-clubs, where film fans
pooled their funds to rent films unavail-
able in commercial theaters. Fascinated
\\ ith the classics of silent illm. he was
one of man\ cinephiles \sho became
concerned, \s+»en sound films sup>planted
siients, not only that these works would
no longer be screened but that they
might not physicalU surv ive: some old
films were alreads being destro\ed and
reocled for their chemicals. The first
steps to conserve the heritage of cinema
were taken in the earlv
1 930s bv muse-
ums and archives in Sweden, Britain, and
the United States. In France, Langlois
joined \s ith several others in
1 935 to
establish the Cinematheque Fran«;aise. or
French film library. He was t\vent>'-one
\-ears old.
The goals of the Cinematheque went
bevond earlier efforts elsewhere: to pre-
serve old films but also to screen them
for the public. Moreover, while some
other archives limited their collecting to
"great" films, Langlois and his associates
had a more eclertic policv—not v-et to
save evervlhing iwnich in retrospect film
historians wish had been possible) but to
bring in a broad range of works, from art
films to popular genres. In 1938 repre-
sentatives of four film archives—the
Cir>ematheque, the Museum of Modern
Art in New York, the British Film
Institute, and the German Reichs-
filmarchiv—founded the Federation
Internationale des Archives du Film
(FIAFi. which has grown to have scores
of member archives from around the
world.
A cofounder of the Cinematheque was
Georges Franju <1912-1987t. a friend of

and fiction filmmaker. Another important

writing important studies on German

Irascible and contentious. Langlois
made enemies as well as friends. Some
questioned his tactics during World War
II. suggesting that he collaborated with
German occupation forces in order to
safeguard his collection. Nevertheless,
after the war the Cinematheque contin-
ued to grow as a great repositorv of
films and documents relating to film
history, and as a screening place where
several generations of 'Children of
the Cinematheque' have learned to
love film.

flashes of the Eiffel Tower and other "sights" reflected in glass
doors. Monsieur Hulot makes an occasional appearance in a film
which, like Tati's earlier comedies,
lets the spectator search out
moments of humor in a distanced mise-en-scene.
Eric Rohmer
it is perhaps ironic that the last of the Cahiers critics to emerge as
a prominent filmmaker, Eric Rohmer (b. 1920), found success at
the end of the
1 960s with films completely removed from the
contemporary turmoil. Rohmer was in fact the oldest of the
Cahiers group and had been making films for twenty years, but
found wide recognition only with Ma Nuit chez Maud {My Night
at Maud's, 1969) and Le Cenou de Claire {Claire's Knee, 1970).
These were part of what he labeled Six Moral Tales, films made
between
1 963 and
1 972. They were chamber dramas set among
the middle class, in which a man tests his desire for one woman
in the moral framework of attraction to others. Serious but
lighthearted, the films featured conversation about religion, phi-
losophy, fiction, and feelings. They were antidotes to Godard's
apocalyptic trajectory, further evidence that, whatever else
it
accomplished, the New Wave also transformed and carried
forward what
it had once vehemently opposed, the French
"Tradition of Quality" in cinema.
How should we assess the French New Wave?
It was more dif-
fuse than earlier film movements and—with the exception of
Codard— less embattled. Soviet cinema, Weimar cinema, and
Italian neorealism had all been, broadly speaking, ideologically
suppressed; the New Wave played itself out in diversity and indi-
vidual gesture. But
its importance should not be underestimated.
It demonstrated that cinema remained capable of stylistic inno-
vation.
It reinvigorated French filmmaking and marked the
significance of the national context even (or especially) as
it took
part in international art cinema; filmmakers from other countries
could use the French New Wave as a model for a filmmaking
endeavor simultaneously national and international.
It was the
first film movement of the twentieth century's second half, and
it
gave early attention to the economic and social configurations
the turning of culture into commodity, the blending of popular
and high arts—that have marked the "postmodern condition" of
the century's late decades.

c
^^
i
The years 1959-60 were a water-
^^^^
^^B
shed period in international politics,
^^^^^^^r
with consequences quite as profound
for world cinema as events in the realm
of filmmaking. In Africa, the old European colonial empires deci-
sively crumbled, and new independent nations rapidly emerged,
in Latin America, cultural renewal and political debate were
fostered after guerrilla forces in Cuba overthrew the dictatorship of
Fulgencio Batista y Zaidfvar, who had ruled as president or from
behind the scenes for a quarter century; rebel leader Fidel Castro
took power on January
1, 1959. Though the pace of change was
uneven, and in some places social and economic conditions
deteriorated rather than got better, a sense of liberation was in the
air:
it was based on a desire to escape not only traditional imper-
ial domination but the postwar polarization of the world between
the two antagonistic superpowers, the United States and the
Soviet Union. What began in the 1950s as a movement of the
"unaligned" was regarded as a third way, and soon those nations
came to be called Third World.
Though widely used. Third Wodd
is a tricky term for cinema
history. Does
it designate countries that stood outside the two
great blocs of the Cold War era? Does
it denote "underdevel-
oped" or "developing" countries as opposed to advanced
industrialized nations? East instead of West, South rather than
North? All these definitions have been applied to the term Third
World, yet such countries as Cuba, China, Brazil, and Japan meet
some but not others of these criteria.
During the 19GOs filmmakers in these and other countries
devised new names and concepts for the filmmaking practices
N
E M A OF
that had developed
in the wake of political and cultural change.
Cuban director Julio Garcia Espinosa proposed a concept of
"Imperfect Cinema"
in a 1969 essay, "For an Imperfect Cinema."
He was seeking to caution against "the dangers of technique for
technique's sake," as he later explained in an interview, and argu-
ing that "attempts to challenge established conventions and seek
out new approaches" were less likely to attain technical "perfec-
tion."'
In the same year Argentine directors Fernando Solanas
(b. 1936) and Octavio Getino (b. 1935) coined the term Third
Cinema
in an essay, "Towards a Third Cinema." They argued
against both the first cinema, the Hollywood commercial model,
and what they called second cinema— films by auteurs fostering
personal expression, among which they included the works of the
French New Wave. What was needed was a Third Cinema, "out-
side and against the System,
in a cinema of liberation."'
For the subjects of this chapter
I have chosen the title Cinema
of Liberation; though not without ambiguities,
it
is a term that can
broadly encompass the expansion and transformation of film-
making in countries outside the European and North American
mainstreams. By 1960, however, the world context for emerging
cinemas had become more complicated than
it had been, say, for
the postrevolutionary Soviet cinema of the 1920s. Instead of one
mainstream, there were two, as Solanas and Getino suggested,
and each presented both models and dilemmas. Commercial
filmmaking had been joined by international art cinema. The
commercial mainstream provided narrative structures and genre
forms that had proven accessible and popular yet often conveyed
dominant values. International art cinema sought out and hon-
ored innovators, but works that met
its aesthetic criteria often ran

counter to political agendas and popular tastes. At an extreme,
tTlmmakers faced the choice of reaching u ide audiences using tra-
ditional commercial norms, or stri\ ing for artistr\ whose main
impact would come through international recognition.
THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS
If an\ one work can be regarded as exemplif\ ing the achieve-
ments—and ambiguities— of a cinema of liberation,
it
is La
battaglia di Algeri {The Battle of Algiers, 19661, made b\
Italian
director Cillo Pontecorvo ib. 1919i.
It was hailed on
its release as
one of the most remarkable political films in cinema histor\, and
few if any political works made since can stand beside
it.
In Algeria, w hich achie\ed
its independence from France in
1962, an unusual land not uncontro\ersial> step was taken to find
a foreign filmmaker to interpret the nation's re\'olutionar\' struggle.
Vacef Saadi, head of a production compan\, Casbah Films,
approached three p)oliticall\ oriented Italian directors—Luchino
Visconti and Francesco Rosi, in addition to Pontecorvo—before
the latter went on to make the film. ,\s a leader of the National
Liberation Front during the fight for independence, Saadi perhaps
had the prestige and p>o\ver to go outside rather than to one of his
own countr\
s filmmakers, and to gain the public in\oKement that
the film demonstrates. Saadi also performs in the film as a charac-
ter who represents his own role in the fight. In the version
released in the United States, however, Casbah Films
is not
acknow ledged in the production credits.
Pontecorvo and his cinematographer Marcello Catti made an
extraordinarN
effort to give the film the appearance of a non-
fiction document with dark, grainy black-and-white footage, even
though no actualitv material was used. NAore important
is the
work's insistence on the complexity, indeed the traged\, of re\'olu-
tionary struggle. No one
is completely hero or villain: the French
use torture and the Algerians emplo\
terrorist bombs against civil-
ians, and some on each side feel the anguish of these percei\'ed
necessities. The colonial fxjwer appears to achieve its goals in the
events the film depicts; the liberation forces appear defeated. Yet
in the final scenes of a spontaneous demonstration, as surprising
to the NLF as to the French, the film asserts that the struggle has
shaped a popular desire for independence stronger than re\olu-
tionar^ leadership or militan, force. In the script by Franco Solinas
(1927-1982), a revolutionist though captured and destined for
torture and death, can ne\ertheless affirm, "the NLF has more
chances of beating the French army than the French ha\e to stop
historv."^
CHINA
On the ie\ei not of individual works but of national film practice
within the framework of a cinema of liberation. China was among
the first countries to deal with the issues of cinema development
follow ing the Communist victors
in the countrv 's ci\ il war in
1949.
Its model, to be sure, was neither commercial nor art cin-
ema, but filmmaking in the Soviet Union. During the 1950s China
organized
its film industry under total state control, building new
studios and expanding exhibition. In 1958 producfion surpassed
one hundred films (the only year this figure was reached until
1981

Republic, special efforts went into making films that might merit
attention outside China as contributions to film art.
The Lin Family Shop
The most significant of these 1959 works was Linjia puzi
( The Lin
Family Shop), directed bv Shui Hua (b. 1916).
It was based on a
story by China's minister of culture, Mao Dun, that had been pub-
lished in the 1930s. Setting a film in a previous era could make
ideological issues more clear-cut and avoid dealing with con-
temporary controversies. The Lin Family Shop centered on a mer-
chant family beset by debts, official corruption and coercion, and
the consequences of Japanese aggression. The merchant
is less a
capitalist villain than a victim,
\'et the film makes clear— partly
through a voice-over—that his failures led to even greater suffer-
ing among workers and the poor. Though
its ambiguity of charac-
terization was an aspect of its artistry, the film soon came under
criticism for perpetuating an old-fashioned literary model and
inadequately treating the situation of workers and peasants.
Xie Jin
In contrast to the literary emphasis of The Lin Family Shop, direc-
tor Xie Jin (b. 1923) was a successful popular filmmaker using
genre forms to convey political messages. His Hongse niangzijun
{The Red Detachment of Women, 1961
) was also set in the past,
but took the form of a revolutionary action-adventure. American
film hisiorian Jay Leyda, who was working as an adviser in Beijing
at the time, wrote a critical report on the film's "abstract time,
abstract place, stereotyped characters, and illogical action.'"'

Perhaps uniquely among the histories of
national cinemas, Chinese film
is orga-
nized around the concept of generations.
It was onlv with the "fifth generation" of
the 1980s that the work of Chinese
filmmakers became widely known
internationally, as impressive films by
young directors began appearing at festi-
vals (see Chapter 24). Their success
stimulated interest in China's first genera-
tion of the 1930s (see Chapter 10), whose
works had long been unavailable, even
in
China. The middle three generations,
however, remain
little known.
One reason for this lack of recog-
nition
is the damage to careers (and in
some cases,
livesl suffered in all three
generations through political turmoil or
persecution
in the years of the "Cultural
Revolution" from the mid-1960s to
mid-1970s. Members of the second gen-
eration, which began work during the
1940s before the Communists gained
power in 1949, were particularly affected.
Zheng Junii (1911-1969), who directed
two important post-World War
II films,
Yijiang Chunshui Xiang Dong Liu (A
Spring River Flows East, 1947, as co-
director) and Wuya yu maque (Crows
and Sparrows, 1949), died in prison; Cai
Chusheng (1906-1968), Zheng junli's co-
director on A Spring River Flows East,
also died, according to film historian Paul
Clark, "under the pressure of military
harassment." Nor did the third genera-
tion, made up of directors who started
under the new regime in the 1950s, go
unscathed; Shui Hua, director of The Lin
Family Shop, was persecuted in the
Cultural Revolution and did not make a
film between 1965 and 1981.
The fourth generation, Beijing Film
School graduates of the early 1960s, were
harmed in that their careers were post-
poned for more than a decade when
filmmaking was halted during the
Cultural Revolution. This group also suf-
fered artistically, as Xie Fie, vice-president
of Beijing Film Academy and codirector
(with U Lan) of Xiangnu Xiaoxiao (Cirl
from Hunan, 1985), described in a 1984
essay, "My View of the Concept of Film":
"For years we were accustomed to being
saturated with ideas. Our knowledge and
point of view were not gained through
personal experience and independent
thinking; these were swept away by the
mainstream.
It
is natural that the only
thing gained from this was our lack of a
unique and a fresh point of view, and the
lack of personality in our artistic ideas
and styles."
Amid this persecution and disruption a
career of remarkable longevity was forged
bv Xie Jin, who began as an assistant
director in 1948, the era of the second
generation; directed his first film in 1954,
and thus
is designated a member of the
third generation; and continued as an
active filmmaker into the 1990s, as the
only Chinese director prior to the fifth
generation to gain wide international
recognition. After Two Stage Sisters, Xie
Jin was unable to make a fiction feature
over the next twelve years. In 1980 he
directed one of the first Chinese films to
express criticism of abuses of power by
public officials in the People's Republic,
Tianyunshan chuanqi (The Legend of
Tianyun Mountain).

was not a film that would rate a place in international art cinema,
but
it won the top prizes at China's first Hundred Flowers film
awards. In 1965 Xie Jin directed Wutai jiemei (Two Stage Sisters),
a melodrama that was widely admired when
it began to circulate
internationally in the 1980s.
Two Stage Sisters was among the last significant Chinese films
for some years. The Chinese Cultural Revolution plunged the
country into chaos from the mid-1960s for more than a decade,
and was particularly hostile toward artists and intellectuals. Film-
making stopped completely in China during 1967-69, and over
the next few years the only films made were of revolutionary bal-
lets (including a 1971 dance version of The Red Detachment of
Women, not to be confused with Xie )in's 1960 film). Filmmakers
and critics were imprisoned. According to later accounts, critic Ju
Baiyin died from persecutions he suffered because of a 1962 arti-
cle, "Monologue on Cinematic Innovation."'
CINEMA NOVO IN BRAZIL
The most prominent film movement to arise as part of a cinema of
liberation was Cinema Novo (New Cinema)
in Brazil, emerging
in the early 1960s (though Solanas and Cetino in their essay
"Towards a Third Cinema" included Cinema Novo in their second
category, films of personal expression by individual auteurs).
Cinema Novo was not the outgrowth of a revolutionary change in
government, as in China or Algeria, but
it was strongly affected by
388

state policies, both liberal and reactionary. More than almost any
other filmmaking practice, Cinema Novo embodied the multiple
struggles and contradictions involved
in the idea that cinema
could be a liberating force.
Cinema Novo developed
in the aftermath of a failed effort to
establish a commercial film industry in Brazil. A production com-
pany. Vera Cruz, had been set up in 1949 with a plan to import
foreign directors and make expensive prestige productions—
a
kind of instant Tradition of Quality—that could compete in both
the domestic and international markets. The effort collapsed on
both counts, and closed down in 1954. In
its wake, younger film-
makers turned to the Italian neorealist model of low-cost films
concerned with social issues and were buoyed by the French
New Wave's emphasis on auteurs. In a period of political liberal-
ism, when the countr\ 's economic development was widely
debated, filmmakers found bank financing for works dramatizing
the nation's social
ills.
The movement had barely been launched when a military coup
took over in 1964—and tightened
its grip with repressive mea-
sures in 1968. Filmmakers were able to continue their work,
however, and their rhetoric became even more militant. They
began to identify their efforts with Latin America as a whole and
with a Third World struggle against European neocolonialism;
they also proclaimed as a unique cultural expression an indige-
nous "tropicalism"— a conjunction of the cultural forms of native
Brazilian peoples with the popular arts—that set their practice
apart from the European aesthetics of neorealism and the French
New Wave.
Glauber Rocha
The most widely known Cinema Novo filmmaker was Glauber
Rocha (1938-1981
), who also formulated one of the movement's
manifestos in a brief 1965 essay, "An Esthetic of Hunger." There
he speaks of Cinema Novo as "these sad, ugly films, these
screaming, desperate films where reason does not always prevail,"
yet that "will ultimately make the public aware of its own
misery."*" Rocha's reputation rests on four films he made in the
1960s before going into exile from Brazil in 1970: Barravento
("The Turning Wind," but known by
its original
title,
1962), Deus
e o diabo na terra do sol (Black Cod, White Devil, 1964),
Terra
em franse (originally released in English as Land of Anguish.
but more recently known by a more literal translation. Earth
Entranced, 1967), and Antonio das Mortes (1969; known
in English by
its original
title, the name of its lead character).
Barravento is often regarded as Rocha's best film, an under-
standable though problematic judgment, since the director
claimed that he was working on the film only as a producer until
the original writer-director left the project at midpoint and he
stepped in to finish
it. Formally the most traditional of Rocha's
films, Barravento concerns the lives of black men and women in a
fishing community in Bahia,
in Brazil's impoverished northwest.
It
depicts the economic exploitation of the fishermen
in terms simi-
lar to Visconti's La terra trema, but gives greater attention to the
music, myths, and folk religious practices of Afro-Brazilian cul-
ture. The film seems clearly Rocha's in inaugurating what was to
become a pervasive rhetoric of his work—the possibility ol unex-
pected transformation, of a world turned upside down. The
notion of "the turning wind"
is defined
in an opening epigraph:
"Barravento
is the moment of violence when sea and earth
become changed, when
life, love and social standing may be sub-
jected to sudden change."
Black Cod, White Devil and Antonio das Mortes pursue this
concept of reversal. Thev are linked texts—the first black-and-
white, the second color, separated by five years and several
sudden changes in Brazilian politics. They shift the location from
the seacoast of Barravento to the northwest backlands, a region of

legendary outlaws and millennial religious movements. Their
styles expand the ritualism of Barravento toward greater theatrical-
ity and pageantry, with folk ballads on the soundtrack interpreting
events and commenting directly to the spectator. Central to both
works
is the hired killer Antonio das Mortes, a massive, bearded
figure wearing a scarf, a cape, and a leather hat. Refusing intro-
spection
("I know nothing about myself," he says),
in the first film
he hunts down and slays Corisco,
last of the backlands outlaws,
the cangecieros.
In Antonio das Mortes, we learn (Brazilian audiences presum-
ably would already have known this) that the events of Black
God, White Devil were set in the 1930s. Three decades have
gone by, and an older Antonio, haunted by his past, returns to the
backlands. Industry and investment are beginning to make
inroads, but a cangeciero and a religious movement have reap-
peared like ghosts. Antonio experiences a change of heart, seeks
forgiveness for his killing, and says, "Now
I understand who the
real enemy is"—the landowners and other powerful figures who
have hired him to
kill. He also proclaims his own obsolescence,
saying to an intellectual fighting alongside him
in a gun battle,
"Fight with your ideas—they're worth more than
I am." Winner of
a prize at the Cannes Film Festival, Antonio das Mortes evoked
considerable debate over
its "esthetics of violence" (which was an

w-
alternative title sometimes given to Rocha's essay "An Esthetic of
Hunger").
Land of Anguish/Earth Entranced, made between the two back-
lands films,
is concerned with Brazilian intellectual
life, which
Cinema Novo filmmakers began to examine after the 1964 mili-
tary coup.
It focuses on a poet who aspires to be active ana
influential as a journalist and advisor to politicians.
In the opening
sequence, after a coup has ousted his allies, the poet impulsively
refuses to concede defeat. He drives through a police blockade
and
is mortally wounded. The film's central section
is a flashback
retrospective of his political
life, leading up to the crisis with
which
it began. Exploring the relationship between art and power,
it chronicles the failure of an intellectual who played the political
game, rather than, as Antonio das Mortes advised, fighting with
ideas.
Nelson Pereira dos Santos
The filmmaker whose work strikingly represents the shift from
neorealism to "tropicalism"
is Nelson Pereira dos Santos (b. 1928).
A decade older than Rocha, he had made documentaries and fea-
tures in the 1950s and worked as an editor on Barravento. His
Vidas secas {Barren Lives, 1963) dramatized the "esthetics of
hunger" that Rocha had later proclaimed. Based on a classic
391

1930s novel of the northwest backlands, the film depicts a poor
family's struggle to survive in the face of economic exploitation,
police oppression, and a harsh environment. Though the novel
was compared to John Steinbeck's The Crapes of Wrath, the film
has closer affinities to Italian neorealism, which dos Santos
acknowledged. Fabiano, the father of Barren Lives,
is akin to
Antonio, the father of Bicycle Thieves, as well-meaning men
overwhelmed by circumstances, fading into oblivion in an
inhospitable world.
By 1971, dos Santos was challenging European culture in Como
era gostoso o meu Frances (How Tasty Was My Little French-
man). Set in the sixteenth century, and shot in color largely with a
hand-held camera, the film presents "tropicalism" in
its native
state, with
its tribal men and women unclothed. A French man
is
captured by a tribe and made a slave, prior to the time when he
will be killed and eaten. The film presents moments of brutality
and of fellowship in the encounter between European "civiliza-
tion" and tropical "primitivism," while emphasizing through
periodic intertitles Europe's colonial discourse of racial superior-
ity. Conditioned by familiar narrative conventions about the lone
hero among strange peoples, the spectator awaits a "happy end-
ing": his deliverance, perhaps accompanied by his native wife.
But the wife blocks his escape, and the happy ending belongs to
the tribe. Cannibalism
is a social fact, rather than the grisly shock
Godard made
it in Weekend, and also a metaphor: Europe's
presence in the new world has been "digested" and turned into
something no longer recognizable as European.
LATIN AMERICAN CINEMA
Cuba
Besides Brazil's Cinema Novo, the other major new component
in Latin American filmmaking of the 1960s was the Cuban revolu-
tion. Other countries continued to struggle with the traditional
difficulties of cinemas on the margin of the mainstream— foreign
domination of exhibition, inadequate production funding, limited
international recognition. But Cuba, soon after the Castro govern-
ment gained power in 1959, initiated a radical break with
its past,
including these structures of cinematic subordination.
Rapidly escalating mutual antagonism with the United States
led Cuba to align with the Communist bloc. Political tensions rose
to new heights with the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion by Cuban
exiles supported by the United States, followed by the 1962
Cuban missile crisis in which nuclear war was threatened after the
United States discovered that the Soviet Union was building mis-
sile bases in Cuba (the crisis ended when the Soviets agreed to
dismantle the bases). As Castro's government transformed
itself
into a communist regime,
it became clear that Cuba's new model
of socialist filmmaking practiced some of the familiar constraints
of other socialist cinemas, including ideological control and
repression of dissidents. Nevertheless, for many in Latin America
and elsewhere the Cuban experience encouraged renewed ideal-
ism and the possibility of utilizing cinema for social change.
In March 1959 the Castro government established the Instituto
Cubano del Arte y Industria Cinematograficos (Cuban Institute of
Cinematographic Art and Industry), known by
its acronym,
ICAIC. Among
its tasks were the training of filmmakers, docu-
menting the country's political transformation, finding films for
theaters after Hollywood distributors withdrew from the country
because of the U.S. government's prohibition of commerce with
Cuba, and fostering filmmaking styles commensurate with politi-
cal ideology. This latter question became acute after Cuba
defeated the American-backed invaders at the Bay of Pigs.
In
that charged atmosphere, a short film was banned because
it showed scenes of Havana low
life considered offensive to the
"Revolution." The debate that erupted among intellectuals and
artists climaxed when Fidel Castro himself delivered a speech,
"Words to the Intellectuals," which closed with the phrase:
"Within the Revolution, everything, against
it, nothing."^
Nearly a decade passed before Cuba began to produce signifi-
cant fiction feature films. In 1968 Cuban filmmaking made
its
mark with two works that received wide international attention,
Memorlas del subdesarollo (Memories of Underdevelopment),
directed by Tomas Gutierrez Alea (b. 1928), and Lucfa, a film by
Humberto Solas (b. 1942).
MEMORIES OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT.
From his Studies
at Rome's Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia (along with
fellow Cuban Julio Garcfa Espinosa,
later the theorist of
"Imperfect Cinema"), Gutierrez Alea brought back a neorealist
approach to filmmaking. But by the later 1960s, developments
like the French New Wave and Cinema Novo, as well as his own
analysis of Cuban circumstances, led him to a more eclectic, self-
reflexive style. Combining actuality with fiction footage, material
from television and other films, and scenes foregrounding the
making of the text itself. Memories of Underdevelopment is an
exploration of the politics of representation as much as a realist
depiction of a social world. Based on a novel with the same origi-
nal
title (but translated in English as Inconsolable Memories), the
film
is set in the crucial period between the Bay of Pigs and the
following year's missile crisis.
Its protagonist, Sergio,
is a middle-
class man who has refused to flee with his family to Miami but
is
also unable to commit to the new regime. Neither revolutionary
nor counter-revolutionary, he
is "nothing"— a figure formed by
underdevelopment and living detached and alienated, without
meaning. Memories of Underdevelopment is a subtle portrait of
an old Cuba passing away and a new Cuba struggling to be born.
LUcfA.
Solas came from a different generation than Gutierrez
Alea. As a teenager he fought as an urban guerrilla against the
Batista dictatorship, and he began making films at ICAIC before
he was twenty. For Lucfa, his breakthrough work, he developed a
strongly melodramatic approach, while filming with an almost
constantly moving hand-held camera. Committed to a postrevolu-
tionary revision— and revisioning— of Cuba's history, Solas
frames that effort in Lucfa through three episodes concerned with
different women named Lucfa. The first Lucfa
is an unworldly
aristocrat, a fool for love who
is tricked into betraying her country-
men during the 1890s struggle against Spanish colonialism. The
second Lucfa
is an idealistic middle-class woman of the early
1930s whose love for a revolutionary ends in tragedy after the vio-
lent overthrow of an earlier dictator fails to change business as
usual. The third episode
is set in "196-," and
its Lucfa
is a revolu-
tionary in her own right, but she struggles with her bridegroom
against machismo, traditional male privilege and possessiveness
which the Revolution has not (yet) reformed. For
its scope, variety,
and energy, Lucfa remains a vivid achievement of political
cinema.

Argentina
Drawing inspiration from Cuba among other sources, a group in
Argentina called Cine Liberacion (Liberation Cinema) made a
remarkable political film, La hora de los hornos {The Hour of the
Furnaces, 1968), codirected by Fernando Solanas and Octavio
Getino (who the following year published their manifesto
"Towards a Third Cinema"). Though normally classified as a
documentary, the film's purpose in part was to explode such cate-
gorizations in order to make spectators perceive and think freshly,
about both politics and communications forms.
It
is a work of
political advocacy cast in avant-garde style— a collage film utiliz-
ing a wide variety of image/sound juxtapositions and contrast
editing, printed text,
still images, borrowed scenes from fiction
films, acted sequences, advertisements, voice-over, and sound
effects. The full-length film,
in three parts, ran to four hours and
twenty minutes; only Part One, a ninety-minute segment dealing
broadly with the subject of neocolonialism, generally circulates in
the LJnited States. The second and third sections, concerned more
specifically with the Argentine situation, contained suggested
break points for audience discussion.
Part One presents the view that violent rebellion
is an appropri-
ate response to the social disorders caused by existing forms of
domination. Among
its most striking visual sequences
is a mon-
tage of scenes from a slaughterhouse interspersed with shots of
advertisements for foreign products, suggesting that a dependent
culture and economy are linked to a life-destroying system. The
film
is dedicated to Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary killed
in 1967 while leading a guerrilla group in Bolivia, and other
"patriots who have fallen
in the struggle for the liberation of Latin
America." In contrast to
its fast-paced editing style. Part One ends
with a shot of Guevara's face, filmed after his death, held on-
screen for three minutes, while drums beat on the soundtrack.
Bolivia
Another significant work of political advocacy, made as narrative
fiction, was the Bolivian film Yawar Maliku (Blood of the Condor,
1969), directed by Jorge Sanjines (b. 1936).
it dramatized charges
that members of the United States Peace Corps (called "Progress
Corps"
in the film) were sterilizing Indian women without their
consent in an obstetrics clinic. Both the Bolivian and United

States governments sought unsuccessfully to suppress the film,
while experts supported
its accusations. Peace Corps activities
ended in Bolivia two years after the film's release.
AFRICAN CINEMA
With nations throughout the continent achieving independence in
the period around 1960, Africa might have appeared primed to
play a central role in the emerging cinema of liberation. Substan-
tial impediments existed, however, to the growth of filmmaking.
Foremost was the lack of economic development of any sort in
the former European colonies, leaving cinema as a low priority for
scarce financial resources. Moreover, the colonial powers, espe-
cially France in the regions
it had previously ruled, maintained
control over film distribution. As had been the case since the early
twentieth century in countries outside the large film-producing
nations, local theaters played cheap foreign imports in preference
to indigenous works. Filmmaking in the newly independent coun-
tries of Africa barely got under way in the 1960s, and did not
become a significant practice for another decade or more.
Ousmane Sembene
The founder of feature filmmaking in black Africa, or Africa south
of the Sahara desert, was Ousmane Sembene (b. 1923) of
Senegal, a major figure both in literature and film. After fighting
with Free French forces under Charles de Gaulle during World
War
11, Sembene spent the postwar years as a dockworker in
France, where he began publishing fiction written in French.
Around the time of Senegal's independence, he came to the view
that in order to communicate with a substantiallv nonliterate pop-
ulation in his home country, he needed to make films. Sembene
studied filmmaking in Moscow and returned to Africa
in the early
1960s as a writer and film director.
Sembene made the first black African feature film with La Noire
de
. .. [Black Girl, 19661, followed by Mandabi ("The Money
Order," but known by
its original
title, 19681, fm/fa/(1971), Xala
(1974), and Ceddo (1977). Though surely his work belongs to a
cinema of liberation, Sembene largely eschewed the technical
innovations of the Latin Americans. His style has sometimes been
called "classical," but
it
is more accurate to describe
it as "realist"
in the sense that Andre Bazin used the term. He utilized careful
395

composition in the frame, medium shots, and long takes with
lit-
tle camera movement. His mise-en-scene seems tailored for the
audience he wished to reach, providing ample time and space for
spectator interrogation of the image. Through subtle handling of
decor, costume, language, performance, and narrative, he fash-
ioned a critique of colonialism and neocolonialism quite as
powerful as could be found in more modernist filmmaking styles.
BLACK CIRL.
Sembene's first feature dealt with colonialism
in
its production as well as
its narrative. Co-produced by a French
company,
it was shot largely in France, with a French cinematog-
rapher and editor, mostly French performers, and the French
language almost exclusively on the soundtrack. These French con-
tributions, as Senegalese filmmaker and critic Paulin Soumanou
Vieyra has written, were thought to insure "high technical quality,
as per the French brand image.

1966),
directed by Ousmane Sembene.
Sembene's viewpoint shaped the film.
It was based on one of his
novels, which
in turn had been developed from a newspaper
account of an African woman's suicide in France. A young black
woman arrives in France as an employee of a French family for
whom she had worked
in Dakar, Senegal. The imperious wife
inexplicably treats her as a prisoner and drudge, while the alco-
holic husband
is ineffectual. The despairing woman slits her
wrists in a bathtub. The film
is most intriguing as a sketch of colo-
nial mentality, exemplified by a French family that exposes
its
racism and weakness outside the colonial setting.
XALA.
By 1974, the time of Xala, Sembene had an international
reputation as a filmmaker (he was already widely known as a
novelist) and was able to finance the film entirely within Senegal.
Nevertheless, his target was neocolonialism,
in a masterly tragi-
comedy whose seriousness gradually emerges from what seems at
first lighthearted satire. The opening sequence set the tone:
declaring their independence from colonial influence, Senegalese

businessmen kick out the Frenchmen who run their business asso-
ciation; then the French deliver briefcases filled with cash and
return as "advisers."
One of the businessmen,
El Hadj, uses his new wealth to take
on a third wife. "Modernity must not make us lose our Africanity,"
says a colleague, referring to the male practice of polygamy. But El
Hadj has received a curse—the Xala, pronounced ha-la— and
cannot fulfill his sexual duties with his new young wife. His fail-
ures multiply, and he loses both his business and the new wife.
The curse had been placed on him by one of the poor people he
had previously cheated or ignored, and the film ends in a stark
scene of El Hadj submitting to be spat on by beggars, as a means
of lifting the Xala. As in other works, Sembene uses language as a
key to power and consciousness in a neocolonial environment.
El
Hadj, who speaks French with his colleagues, grows angry when
a daughter addresses him
in the native language, Wolof; but
when he
is under attack he asks to defend himself in Wolof and
is told that he
is "racist, sectarian, reactionary."
Egyf^t
in North Africa as well as sub-Sahara Africa distinctions among
filmmaking practices have been made on regional, geopolitical,
cultural,
linguistic, and other grounds. But
it
is
still useful to think
about the whole continent— of Africa, as one regards Latin
America or Asia— while keeping narrower divisions in mind.
In
these terms, Africa's strongest commercial film industry was in
Egypt, which for decades had managed to produce up to forty or
fifty films a year for a small urban audience and African export.
An internationally prominent filmmaker who emerged from this
industry was Youssef Chahine (b. 1926; sometimes spelled
in
English "Shahin"), who had studied acting at the Pasadena Play-
house in California and began directing films in the early 1950s.
In 1953 Chahine gave a first film role to Omar Sharif (b. 1932), an
Egyptian actor who became a popular figure in world cinema.
Changes in internal politics made
it possible for Chahine to shift
from genre work to a neorealist style, and his most important film
of the period, Al-Ard {The Land, 1969), resembled the Brazilian

views were difficult to put into practice.
The building of an African cinema by and
for Africans has been hampered not only
by the legacies of colonialism, which
include foreign domination of film distrib-
ution, but also by the reluctance of some
African governments to foster the
development of free and creative (thus
potentially critical) film cultures.
With the principal exception of
Ousmane Sembene and other Senegalese
directors, African filmmaking in the 1960s
and 1970s consisted to a significant
extent of films made by exiles. Hondo (b.
1936)
is an example. Born
in Mauritania
in northwest Africa (his full name
is
Mohamed Abid Hondo), he launched his
career in France and continued to make
his films there. Writing about the com-
plexities of exile, Hondo has nevertheless
maintained that he had "established a
national cinema, even though conceived
and put together outside my country. For,
if exile remains as the worst thing, what
is
essential, in the heart of that worst,
is to
be conscious of what has to be struggled
against." His films include Soleil O (O
Sun, 1970), Les Bicots-negres, vos voisins
( The Nigger-Arabs, Your Neighbors,
1973), and West Indies (1979). Sarraounia
(1986), a historical film on the colonial
era, was Hondo's first work set in Africa.
Another exile, Haile Cerima (b. 1946),
left Ethiopia to study in the United States
and stayed to become a filmmaker
and educator in the context of black
American cinema. He returned to
Ethiopia in 1974 to make his only African
film, Mirt sost shi amit [Harvest 3,000
Years, 1975), an unusual work, shot with
a 16mm camera, concerning the life of a
peasant family.
Senegal was among the first African
countries to develop a broad film culture,
in part because filmmakers who had
trained in France chose to return. A pio-
neer was Paulin Soumanou Vieyra
(1925-1987), who has been called "the
father of Senegalese cinema." As a
student in France in the 1950s, he codi-
rected a short film made with other black
African filmmakers, Afrique sur Seine
(Africa on the Seine, 1955 1. In Senegal he
made short documentaries and became
the leading historian of African cinema,
with four books published (in French)
between 1969 and 1983. In 1981 he
directed his only feature film, En Resi
dence surveillee {Under House Arrest).
Another Senegalese filmmaker who
studied in France was Safi Faye (b. 1943),
considered the first black African woman
to direct feature-length films. Trained in
ethnography as well as in filmmaking,
she returned to make two documentary
features in Senegal, Kaddu Beykat
{Letter from My Village, 1975) and Fad
Jal {Come and Work, 1979).

THE JAPANESE "NEW WAVE"
To include Japanese filmmaking within a chapter on cinema of
liberation may seem incongruous. Japan had gone through an
occupation, but had not experienced a revolution, nor colonial-
ism or neocolonialism
in the senses that those issues had been
addressed by filmmakers in Latin America or Africa. Nevertheless,
it
is important to recognize the new generation that emerged
in
Japan around 1960 as political filmmakers. Newspaper accounts
designated this group as the Japanese nouvelle vague in imitation
of the French movement that had captured world attention. The
term has stuck, but the Japanese "New Wave" has not gained the
broad international recognition accorded earlier or more recent
Japanese filmmakers. This may be because many of their key films
are topical and devoted to social concerns. A more apt compari-
son than the French New Wave,
if one were necessary, would be
to Brazilian Cinema Novo.
The central figure associated with the Japanese "New Wave,"
Nagisa Oshima (b. 1932), has disputed that the new directors con-
stituted a movement at all. They were young filmmakers who
were going through the traditional course of career development
in Japan by working as assistant directors in the major studios.
Their chance to become directors arose because Japanese film
attendance, as in the United States, was declining, and the studios
hoped that younger directors could make films appealing to the
youth audience. In the late 1950s Oshima, Shohei Imamura
(b. 1926), Masahiro Shinoda (b. 1931
), and others directed their
first films.
Nagisa Oshima
While training as a filmmaker, Oshima had also written polemical
film criticism, which may have been why other writers made the
analogy to the critic/filmmakers of the French New Wave. When
Oshima began directing in 1959 the Shochiku studio, his
employer, got more than
it bargained for. From the beginning his
films raised disturbing social issues and depicted social conflicts.
The studio withdrew his fourth film, Nihon no yoru to kiri (Night
and Fog in Japan, 1960) from circulation within days of its
release. Thereafter Oshima formed his own production company.
NICHT AND FOC IN JAPAN.
This controversial film
focused on student activism in Japan during the 1950s, which was
much stronger in those years in Japan than
in North America or
Europe. Student protests focused on Japan's security treaty with
the United States (known
in Japan as "Ampo") on the grounds that
this alliance might lead to a resurgence of Japanese militarism.
Demonstrations were held against the treaty throughout the 1950s
and these erupted in violence in June 1960 when the agreement
between the two countries was renewed. The film
is set at a wed-
ding where different generations of militants are gathered. In long
takes (there are fewer than fifty shots in the nearly two-hour film)
the camera pans and roves among the guests, who debate past
events that are shown in extended flashbacks. Offering conflicting
accounts of the past, the film as a widescreen color production
occasionally resembles a 1950s Hollywood melodrama, with a
revolutionary group replacing a family as
its center. Oshima's
viewpoint clearly supports the younger generation's critique of the
student movement's failures, which are blamed in part on the
authoritarian tactics of the Japanese communist party. Night and
Fog in Japan condemns the older generation for refusing to face
up to past mistakes. The director at this point had not yet seen
Resnais's documentary Night and Fog (see Chapter 17) from
which he borrowed the name; his point was not to make a com-
parison with World War
II concentration camps but to suggest
that darkness and obfuscation stem from an unwillingness to take
historical responsibility.
DEATH BY HANGING.
Oshima's most critically acclaimed
film of the 1960s was Koshikei [Death by Hanging, 1968), based
on an actual case in which a man born
in Japan to Korean parents
was hanged for murdering a Japanese woman. In the fashion of
Buriuel's Land Without Bread,
it begins as what appears to be an
obsessive documentary on the death penalty and executions.
Then the condemned man survives, and the film changes tone
toward a different kind of surrealism, with Japanese officials
debating law, ethics, and religion with increasing hysteria as they
try to figure out a proper way to hang the man again. Oshima's
target was Japanese racism and
ill treatment of Koreans living in
Japan. Perhaps understandably, critical admiration did not help
the film become a success with Japanese audiences.
399

Shohei Imamura
Within Japan, Imamura has been a more highly regarded film-
maker than Oshima, though
it took several decades for his 1960s
films to begin circulating internationally. Imamura's work viewed
Japanese society through a stance of detached observation, as
opposed to Oshima's impassioned critique. He began his career
at Shochiku
in the early 1950s as an assistant to Yasujiro Ozu on
such films as Tokyo Story (see Chapter 15), and though his style
and interests as a director differed from Ozu's, he was seen as a
similar figure whose works represented qualities authentically
"Japanese." All his films from 1959 through 1968 rated highly in
the annual critics' poll, and two
Nippon konchuki (The Insect
Woman, 1963) and Kamigami no fukaki yokubo {The Profound
Desire of the Cods, 1968)— were ranked first.
THE PORNOCRAPHERS.
Imamura's best-known work from
the 1960s outside Japan has been Jinruigaku nyumon (The
Pornographers, 1966), based on a novel with the same title by
Akuyuki Nozaka that has also been widely translated. An
academic-sounding subtitle, "Introduction to Anthropology,"
indicates the director's typical strategy of detachment from his
subject. Narrating events in the life of a confused, unhappy man
who makes cheap 8mm pornographic films, Imamura's work also
uses a visual style of framing devices to distance the spectator:
long shots taken through windows, doorways, and even through a
fish tank, which holds a carp that also figures significantly in the
film. The Pornographers provided a glimpse at the underside of
Japanese culture— its sexual obsessions, small-time gangsters,
and petty corruptions— conveyed with pathos and humor.
Masahiro Shinoda
Like Imamura, Shinoda got his start at Shochiku as an assistant to
Ozu;
like Oshima, the studio launched him as a director with
youth-oriented subjects. When he was able to establish himself
on his own, however, Shinoda shifted his work toward a formal
exploration of style in period films. His most notable work in this
broad generic framework was Shinju ten no Amijima (Double
Suicide, 1969), the top-ranked film for
its year in the critics' poll.
The film was based on the classic Japanese play by Monzaemon
Chikamatsu, The Love Suicide at Amijima,
first presented in 1720
in the Bunraku puppet theater,
later adapted for the Kabuki stage,
and made into several films.
DOUBLE SUICIDE.
Shinoda's approach was to examine the
historical and aesthetic implications of a human narrative created
for puppet performance.
In the opening credit sequence the direc-
tor himself appears backstage at a Bunraku production, planning
a scene in a telephone conversation with his scriptwriter. He
is
wearing the black clothing and stocking mask of a kuroko, the
stagehands who move about the puppet stage but by convention
are regarded as "invisible." After the credits, however, the narra-
tive commences with human performers rather than puppets.
Nevertheless, kuroko stagehands are present in many shots assist-
ing in the action, and sometimes they are shown in close-ups as a
kind of silent chorus to the narrative movement of character des-
tinies. Shinoda also cast performer Shima Iwashita (b. 1941)
in
dual roles as a man's wife and as his courtesan-lover; this
is a fur-
ther treatment of social and performance conventions, whereby a
man can ignore and betray a woman in one role, and passion-
ately join her in a love suicide in the other. Though set in the past.
Double Suicide's reflexivity also addresses
its contemporary
present:
it depicts a tradition- and rule-bound society in which
rebellion leads to self-destruction rather than liberation.
The legacy of the cinema of liberation that emerged
in the
1960s was profound but contradictory. What
it accomplished
above all,
in the wake of historic movements for national indepen-
dence from colonial rule and other political transformations, was
to give new energy and purpose to filmmaking outside North
America and Europe.
It brought into world cinema culture a new

generation of filmmakers from Africa, Asia, and Latin America
who used both familiar and innovative styles to comment on the
historical traditions and political structures of their societies. They
demonstrated once again the capacit\ of film to represent social
actuality and to express new viewpoints. But to what extent could
thev comprise a "Third Cinema," in the words of Solanas and
Getino, "outside and against the Svstem"? With few exceptions,
the cinema of liberation shaded over into the cinema of auteurs—
a subcategory of the international art cinema, e\en
if a fresh and
exciting one—because of the need for private or government
financing, and critical recognition in the international market-
place, as conditions for
its existence.

NINETEEN
HE NEW DOC
T.
I
The transformations of world society and cinema
I
around 1960 also propelled a significant revival of
I
documentary filmmaking. But why, one may ask, did
the nonfiction film need to revive? When
last exten-
sively observed in these pages, documentary was thriving through
both government-sponsored and political advocacy filmmaking.
The strong sense of social purpose fostered by the war seemed to
provide ample incentive to continue the development of actuality
production
in the postwar period. Yet documentary, having been
so important to world cinema
in the 1930-45 era, suffered
through a generally fallow period from 1945 to 1960. What
happened?
There are two principal answers: the cold war, and broadcast
television. The cold war rivalry between the United States and the
Soviet Union heightened sensitivity in western nations to the pro-
paganda and ideological aspects of nonfiction film. Government
support of filmmaking on social or economic problems (such as
1930s works by the Crown Film Unit in Britain or the U.S. Farm
Security Administration) became too controversial. At the same
time, the advocacy films produced by left-wing groups that had
been active in the depression years largely vanished in the face of
political persecution.
In the United States and Britain documen-
tary filmmaking turned toward nonpolitical treatment of such
subjects as the arts or distant locales. Commercial corporations
played a more significant role as sponsors of nonfiction films; pro-
jects that would have been called propaganda
if governments or
advocacy groups had produced them now were categorized as
"public relations." Standard Oil Company, for example, provided
the funds for Robert Flaherty to make his last film, Louisiana Story
(1948), a documentary on
life in the bayous that integrated drilling
for oil into Flaherty's lifelong themes of traditional folkways and
their relationship with nature.
Television changed cinema's role in visual reporting as well as
filmmakers' techniques and styles. Live television broadcasts of
sports and major public events challenged and quickly van-
quished the short newsreels that had been a part of motion
picture programs in many countries.
In the United States, where
commercial television advanced most rapidly, many theaters had
abandoned newsreels by the early 1950s. Live television gave
viewers a sense of direct experience and participants an opportu-
nity to speak
in their own voices;
it offered the possibility that
something unplanned and unexpected might happen. Eventually
viewers would learn that television rarely provided an unmediated
transmission of actuality, that the medium constructed
its own
perspectives (through commentary, camera position, and editing)
that shaped
its presentation of events.
In the first years of televi-
sion, however, these seemed inconsequential alongside the
newsreels' often hyperactive montage style, booming music,
and obtrusive "voice of Cod" narrations.
Despite the increasing availability of lightweight portable
16mm cameras, the technology for documentary filmmaking
initially did not keep up with the changes brought about by televi-
sion's electronic transmission. Sound recording posed the most
difficult problems. Synchronized sound recorded optically onto
film required a controlled environment and a sound crew—
a
recordist, a mixer, and a boom operator. In Italian neorealist

fiction films this limitation was overcome through postsynchro-
nization, dubbing voices and adding effects in a studio, but this
solution was rarely satisfactory to documentary filmmakers trying
to capture actual events.
During the 1950s, however, technologv began to be developed
for easier on-site sound recording. Magnetic tape replaced optical
recording on film, lightweight recorders that could be operated by
one person were introduced, and svnchronized sound was freed
from a direct cable link to the camera, removing restrictions on
the mobility of image or sound recording. By the end of the 1950s
a technological groundwork was laid for the emergence of new
documentary film st\les that offered even greater immediacy and
directness than was available, at that time, through television
technology.
CINEMA VERITE
The famous term for the new documentarN
style was cinema
verite— literallv, film truth.
It was derived bv French filmmaker
Jean Rouch (b. 1917) from Soviet documentarian Dziga Vertov,
who named a newsreel series Kino Pravda—"Film Truth"— after
the Soviet Communist party newspaper Pravda^'Truth" (see
Chapter 7l. However, when Rouch used the concept for the first
time in Chronique dun ete (Chronicle of a Summer, 1961, made
with Edgar Morini, emphasis was placed not on film as truth, but
(as an English subtitle translates the voice-over) on "an experi-
ment in filming the truth."
Jean Rouch
Rouch's background was as an ethnographic filmmaker working in
Africa after World War
II. One of his most widely known films of
the period was Les Maltres fous {The Mad Masters, 1955), a half-
hour color film about a religious sect in colonial British West
Africa (later Ghanai that performed ceremonies of "possession"
mimicking the protocols of colonial governance. The film was
criticized bv both colonialists and anticolonialists, as well as by
animal rights advocates w ho objected to scenes of rituals in
which a dog's throat
is cut and participants drink
its blood.
CHROSICLE OF A SUMMER. Rouch's critics Suggested that
he turn his attention to the customs of his own country. The Mad
Masters and Rouch's other ethnographic films had been tradi-
tional documentaries whose "voice" belonged to the filmmaker,
through post-synchronized voice-over narration, rather than
to the filmed subjects. In the late 1950s, however, he learned of
innovative work being done w ith new technologies b\ Quebec
filmmakers in the French-language unit of Canada's National Film
Board, and he invited director and cinematographer Michel Brault
(b. 1928) to work with him as camera operator on a documentary
about people living in Paris. The other major collaborator was
Edgar Morin (b. 1921
), a sociologist and film theorist, who
is cred-
ited as codirector.
As "an experiment in filming the truth," Chronicle of a Summer
brought the filmmakers out from behind the camera— or the
off-screen recorded voice-over— and placed them among its sub-
jects. At the beginning Rouch and Morin are shown on screen
discussing with a woman, Marceline, whether
it was possible to
403

h thnograf>hic r
Ethnography
is defined as "a branch of
anthropology dealing with the scientific
description of individual cultures," and
ethnographic film—the creation of a
visual record concerning an individual
culture— has become an expanding part
of the field. What counts as an ethno-
graphic film, however, and what are
appropriate methods and procedures in
making such films, remain open to
intense debate.
Almost all the works designated as
ethnographic films have been made by
Europeans and North Americans ventur-
ing to other parts of the world to film
native cultures. The earliest such films
(though on North American subjects)
were In the Land of the War Canoes
(1914), made by the photographer Edward
S. Curtis (1868-1952) among the KwakiutI
Indians of the Canadian province British
Columbia, and Robert Flaherty's Nanook
of the North (1922). The first films made
explicitly from ethnographic research
were based on thousands of feet of
footage taken by the noted anthropolo-
gists Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead
in Bali and New Guinea during the
1930s;
in 1952 they released six short
films edited from this material, including
Trance and Dance in Ball and Childhood
Rivalry in Bali and New Guinea.
The next generation of ethnographic
filmmakers— exemplified in France by
Jean Rouch and
in the United States by
John Marshall
(b. 1932), who made The
Hunters (1958) among the Bushmen of
the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa
faced new questions raised by changing
theoretical concerns in both ethnography
and documentary film. How much did
the presence of cameras actually alter the
behavior of filmed subjects, thus render-
ing the films "inauthentic"? Could
filmmakers retain the stance of "observer"
or should they record their own interac-
tion with the subjects in a more
"participatory" mode? Was
it in fact pos-
sible to combine ethnographic standards
with effective filmmaking, or did one
have to take precedence over the other?
These issues were debated as ethno-
graphic filmmaking rapidly developed in
the 1960s. One model project involved a
/-^ ilm
collaboration between filmmaker Timothy
Asch and anthropologist Napoleon
Chagnon; after Chagnon completed his
fieldwork among the Yanomamo people
of southern Venezuela, he returned with
Asch to shoot footage illustrating his pub-
lished research, resulting in The Feast
(1970) and other films.
Another experiment was devised by
communications scholar Sol Worth and
anthropologist John Adair to test a theory
that modes of visual expression derive
from the structure of language.
In 1966
they gave cameras to eight Navajo people
in the southwestern United States who
had never made films before. These film-
makers produced twenty short films for
Worth and Adair's "Navajos Film
Themselves" series. The hypothesis had
been that they would communicate visu-
ally the worldview embodied in the
Navajo language and provide an "authen-
tic" ethnographic record, but the results
were inconclusive; for one thing, the film-
makers were familiar with the visual styles
of commercial films and had preconcep-
tions of how a film should look.

conduct a conversation in a "natural" manner with a camera
present. Rouch tells her, "Anything you object to can always be
cut." Morin states that the goal
is to make a film about how peo-
ple live.
Interviewers with microphones confront people on the street
and ask, "Are you happy?" There are discussions around dinner
tables; confessional scenes in tight close-ups; conversations on
factory work, race relations, African independence, the Holo-
caust. At the end the participants are shown gathered
in a
screening room as they comment both for and against a provi-
sional version of the film-in-progress. Morin insists that the film,
"unlike normal cinema, reintroduces us to
life," but
its subject
seems more the filmmakers themselves and their ideas about
making a film about
life. The final shots are of Rouch and Morin,
discussing how difficult their project was and the further troubles
they anticipate.
Chris Marker
Along with Rouch, Chris Marker (b. 1921
)
is also identified as a
leading practitioner of cinema verite, but his work further compli-
cates the concept. His four-hour documentary on Parisian

is more concerned

In other films Marker experimented with documentary form. In
Lettre de Siberie [Letter from Siberia, 1958), he repeats a banal
sequence— a bus and a car at an intersection, a passing man,
workers laying pavement—three times. The first time a voice-over
interprets the scenes in glowing positive terms, the second time
it
is highly critical, and the third time its words are neutral and
"objective." Where
is "film truth" to be found? With animated
footage, a mock advertisement for reindeer, and occasionally
rhyming voice-over. Letter from Siberia sends up conventional
documentary. La Jetee
( The Jetty, 1964)
is a haunting science
fiction film consisting of still photographs and a voice-over
narration. Marker's work
is shaped more bv avant-garde subjectiv-
ity than a search for "film truth.

DIRECT CINEMA
Though
it became a familiar label for the new documentary tech-
niques, cinema verite seemed a term that claimed too much while
defining too
little. Alternative English-language names were
coined that described not the lofty goals of documenting "truth"
but a way of regarding the process of filming with hand-held cam-
eras and synchronized sound. Observational cinema was such a
term, and the one most widely adopted was direct cinema, attrib-
uted to filmmaker Albert Maysles (b. 1926).
Drew Associates
Coinciding with developments in Quebec and France, a group of
United States filmmakers began to work out new documentary
techniques at Drew Associates. Headed by Robert Drew (b.

it was a production unit of the broadcasting division of the
Time-Life publishing corporation.
Its aim was to produce for tele-
vision films on subjects covered
in Life magazine, with the same
immediacy and intimacy for which Lite's photographic style was
noted. Drew was producer, reporter, and narratcjr, while cine-
matography was in the hands of filmmaker Richard Leacock (b.
1921), who had photographed Flaherty's Louisiana Story. Others
joined the group who would later become known as important
documentary filmmakers on their own, including Maysles and
D. A. Pennebaker (b. 1930).
PRIMARY. Drew Associates's first significant film, Primary
(1960), was also their most notable, both as film history and polit-
ical history.
Its subject was the Democratic party's 1960
presidential primary contest in Wisconsin between U.S. Senators
F^ubert H. Humphrey and John
F. Kennedy, who, of course, later
won the nomination and the presidential election. This was the
first behind-the-scenes motion picture view of an American politi-
cal campaign— as Drew's voice-over claims, accurately

elegantly, "seen close-up, as there's never before been captured
by the camera." Four camera teams were utilized, with Leacock,
Maysles, Pennebaker, and Terrence Macartney-Pi Igate (b. 1924), a
British filmmaker who had become a prominent documentary
director with Canada's National Film Board, filming the candi-
dates' activities. The potential for hand-held cameras with
synchronized sound was demonstrated in a famous tracking shot
as a camera operator follows Kennedy making his way through a
crowd of supporters, conveying a visceral sense of the campaign's
excitement, movement, and human variety (the shot has been
credited to Maysles).

Drew Associates closed
down in 1963, after which Leacock and Pennebaker formed
their own production company, and Maysles teamed up in
another company with his brother David (1932-1987). Leacock's
first post-Drew film was A Happy Mother's Day (1963), made
with Joyce Chopra (b. 1938). Like the Drew films,
it was under-
taken with corporate sponsorship, and deals in a similar manner
with a behind-the-scenes look at a newsworthy event (in this
case, the birth of quintuplets to a family in Aberdeen, South
Dakota). A Happy Mother's Day made clear the differences
between American direct cinema and the French cinema verite
effort to depict "life" by filming the private activities of ordinary
people.
It carried forward the direct cinema tendency to make
films on topics that were also involved with press coverage, pub-
licity, or promotion (this may be linked to the fact that many direct
cinema films were produced for television rather than for theatri-
cal exhibition).
D. A. Pennebaker
Pennebaker's feature documentaries also drew on this public con-
text, but
in a way that helped to stimulate exhibitors' interest in
booking nonfiction films for theatrical audiences. Don't Look
Back (1967) and Monterey Pop (1968) were both concerned with
popular music and appealed strongly to young audiences for
whom television and video did not yet provide sufficient images
of their musical favorites. Don't Look Back gave a behind-the-
scenes view of Bob Dylan's 1965 tour of Britain. Photographed
almost entirely by Pennebaker (in contrast to the multiple camera
operators of films such as Primary),
it displays a kinetic visual
style rarely attempted so extensively before— almost constant
camera movement, along with frequent pans, zooms, and refo-
cusing within a shot. Monterey Pop was a concert film of the
1967 Monterey, California, Internationa! Pop Festival.
It presented
thirteen performances by rock and popular music groups, inter-
spersed with shots of the crowd, who by this time in 1960s
culture, in dress, hair, and demeanor, were definitely part of the
show.

Maysles Brothers
The films of Albert and David Maysles, codirected with ChaHotte
Zwerin (b. 1931
), brought into sharper focus the issues arising in
direct cinema documentaries. After several films dealing w^ith
celebrities or musicians in the Drew style, the Maysles brothers
made Salesman (1969), described by Stephen Mamber, a historian
of direct cinema, as "the most important product of American
cinema verite."'
it was among the first works in the new docu-
mentary style to deal with ordinary
life. The filmmakers followed
salesmen from the Mid-American Bible Company on the road
and into the homes of Roman Catholic parishioners, potential
customers for illustrated Bibles. The film centers on the develop-

ing crisis of one salesman, whose success diminishes as his spiels
grow shriller. Member and other critics have raised such questions
as whether the filmmakers' presence caused the crisis, or whether
the film was constructed through fictional techniques to create a
stronger narrative and make a potentially dull subject more dra-
matic. Salesman followed the direct cinema convention (unlike
the films of Rouch or Marker) of keeping the filmmakers off-
screen, maintaining a kind of fiction of invisibility and neutrality.
In Gimme Shelter {]970), a film on the Rolling Stones rock
group and their controversial 1969 concert at Altamont Speedway
in California, the Maysles brothers broke this convention, and
it
is
worth giving attention to their purpose in doing so. They appear
at the opening of the film and periodically thereafter, showing
footage to Mick Jagger and other Stones on a flatbed editing
machine; gradually
it becomes clear that they are watching the
same edited scenes of the concert that we spectators also see.
This material
is a far cry from the mellow Monterey Pop. Two
years had radically changed the music world and American youth
culture. There are shots of selling and taking drugs, bad trips,
nudity, violence, and growing disorder, while musicians plead for
people to "stop hurting each other."
The Maysles had more than twenty cameras at the concert, and
one of them captured on film the fatal stabbing of a man by a
member of the Hells Angels motorcycle group. The filmmakers
show this scene to Jagger on the editing machine, repeating the
image and stopping the frame for him and for us.
"It's so horri-
ble," Jagger comments. This unusual self-reflexivity provides a
way both to use the murder footage and to construct a frame so
that spectators do not experience
it with the immediacy and inti-
macy for which direct cinema normally strove.
Frederick Wiseman
An important filmmaker in the new documentary techniques who
was not associated with the Drew group was Frederick Wiseman
(b. 1930). To distinguish his approach from theirs, Wiseman used
the term "reality fiction," explaining that the filmmaker creates "a
form which has a
life of its own, and that form
is a fiction because
it does not exist apart from the film.""'
Wiseman's films focused on institutions. His first documentary,
Titicut Follies (1967), concerned a prison hospital for the mentally
ill
in Massachusetts. After initial public screenings, the state took
legal action to suppress the film on the grounds that consent had
not been obtained from the subjects who had been photo-
graphed. (The film's defenders countered that Massachusetts did
not want the public to see the horrible conditions that the work
revealed.) Titicut Follies was banned from general distribution for
more than two decades, until an agreement reached
in 1991
per-
mitted
its rerelease. Wiseman's High Schoo/ (1968), filmed at
Northeast High School
in Philadelphia, was also controversial
and withheld from screening in that city. Some saw the film as an
attack on the school, or high schools in general, while others
found exploitative the filmmaker's approach to his subjects.

sparked a revival of propaganda and advocacy filmmaking.

groups, stemmed from the 1930s and World War
II. The impera-
tive to persuade seemed to rule out techniques of cinema verite or
direct cinema, which at least rhetorically presented themselves as
more purely observational or neutral. Traditional documentary
techniques such as musical soundtracks and an emphasis on
montage dominated the first nonfiction films about Vietnam.
These works once again raise questions about the role of tech-
nique in a film's political effectiveness: do we respond to such
films largely through our previous political opinions, or can
effective film technique persuade us to change our views?

almost constant narrative voice-over, as well as speeches by
President Lyndon B. Johnson and other officials. One shot has

it to the world of totalitarian

Nineteen Eighty-Four. After the success of government propa-
ganda documentaries during Wodd War

marked the failure of such efforts to bolster support for United
States policy in Vietnam.'
Hanoi Tuesday the 13th
Films critical of United States involvement in Vietnam used many
of the same types of images as appeared in Why Viet-nam: peas-
ants working in rice fields, suffering children, dead bodies,
flag-draped coffins. What enabled these images to communicate
a certain message in one film and the opposite in another? To a
considerable extent, the answer lies in the shaping context the
filmmaker created through editing and sound accompaniment.

images his birth as a monster.
In contrast, the Vietnam footage
is
accompanied by a gentle, upbeat musical score, without com-
mentary. Hanoi Tuesday the 13th attempts to persuade not
through factual argument or exhortation but by an eclectic mix of
humor, elegy, and shock.

The Image War
The Vietnam war prompted filmmakers in many countries to pro-
duce advocacy works, almost all of them opposed to United
States involvement. Political filmmaker Joris Ivens (see Chapter 11)
made two films in Vietnam, Le Ciel,
la terreiThe Sky, the Earth,
1965) and Le Dix-septieme Parallele {The Seventeenth Parallel,
1968), and contributed footage to Loin du Viet-nam (Far from
Vietnam, 1967), a collective work by French filmmakers produced
by Chris Marker and including segments by Agnes Varda, lean-
Luc Godard, and Alain Resnais, among others. These works, and
some made by the North Vietnamese government, circulated
widely in Europe, although manv were banned from the United
States. After Why Viet-nam, however. United States government
film activities about the war were minimal. Hollywood director
lohn Ford participated
in a project for the United States
Information Agency intended for overseas showing, Vietnam!
Vietnam! (1972), but the film was withdrawn after only a few
screenings. The United States conceded the war of images several
years before
it withdrew from Vietnam.
DOCUMENTARY
RENAISSANCE
The post-1960 period also experienced a renaissance of nonac-
tion filmmaking that was connected to neither the techniques nor
the aesthetic claims of cinema verite. The strongest impetus for
this aspect of the documentary revival, as with the development
of direct cinema in the United States, came from television, which
by the 1960s had almost completely supplanted the feature film
industry as a medium of news and information. Networks and
programming bodies in several countries established documentary
units and financed the production of nonfiction films for television
broadcast. Many of these harked back to earlier documentary
models and used traditional techniques such as interviews and re-
editing existing footage. Some made a lasting mark as films
through the quality of their cinematic style or the significance of
their perspectives. A few were so controversial that they never
made
it to television and were distributed instead as films in the-
atrical release.
Point of Order
Television was the source of the original material used in Point of
Order (1964), a compilation film made by Emile de Antonio
(1920-1989). In 1961 the filmmaker acquired some 188 hours of
footage from the CBS television network of a famous 1954 con-
gressional investigation, the so-called Army-McCarthy hearings,
which had been broadcast live and recorded by filming a televi-
sion screen la motion picture image of a television broadcast was
known as a kinescope recording; before the development of
videotape,
it was the only way to preserve live programs). The
hearings were held by a U.S. Senate subcommittee chaired by
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, whose name often designates the
1950s era of anticommunism in the United States (see Chapter
14). The televised proceedings were believed to have undercut
McCarthy's power by exposing his behavior to a large national
audience, especially after Joseph N. Welch, a counsel for the U.S.
Army at the hearings, responded to one of the senator's accusa-
tions by saying, "Until this moment. Senator,
I think
I never really
gauged your cruelty or your recklessness
.
.
. have you no sense of
decency?"
De Antonio claimed not to have been aware of earlier compila-
tion films— he said he learned of Esfir Shub's 1920s Soviet films
reedited from existing footage (see Chapter 7) only after complet-
ing Point of Order. In reducing thirty-six days of testimony to less
than one hundred minutes of film, de Antonio constructed a
highly condensed version of what an opening voice-over calls
"the greatest political spectacle" in the history of American
democracy. The phrase calls attention not only to the hearings
themselves but also to television's new role in shaping the con-

duct and reception of such events. Point of Order was a success
in theatrical release and restored interest in the compilation
documentary.
In the Year of the Pig
For his documentary on the war in Vietnam,
In the Year of the
Pig (1969), which also circulates as Vietnam in the Year of the Pig,
de Antonio went not to one source but to hundreds. An advocacy
film, opposed to United States policy in Vietnam, the work
survives many others with similar purpose because of its rare
historical footage obtained by the filmmaker from sources in
several countries. One unusual sequence, showing Vietnamese
Communist leader Ho Chi Minh aboard a French warship in
1945, de Antonio claimed to have secretly removed from a French
militarv film archive. Senator |oseph R. McCarthv puts in an
appearance as well, asserting,
"If we lose Indochina, we will lose
the Pacific, and we'll be an island in a Communist sea." Also
using powerful contemporary footage shot for television network
news broadcasts, the film makes
its impact through a collage of
moving and
still images, interviews, and voice-overs.
It was nomi-
nated for an Academy Award as a feature documentary.

Police confront
protesters in The War Game
(1965), Peter Watkins's "docu-
mentary reconstruction" on how
Britain's civil defense preparations
might cope with a future nuclear
war.
The War Game
A work that received an Academy Award for feature documentary
was one of the most controversial nonfiction films of the decade,
The War Came (1965), directed by British filmmaker Peter
Watkins (b. 1935). Watkins had become known as a producer of
"documentary reconstruction" films, restaging and shooting his-
torical events so that
it appeared as
if cameras had been present
in cinema verite fashion. He gained backing from the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the public television entity in
Britain founded by royal charter and ostensibly independent of
government control, to make a film for television about Britain's
civil defense preparation for nuclear war. The film
is shaped as a
documentary reconstruction of a possible future event: a nuclear
attack on Britain. Watkins's strategy was to reverse a standard
practice of similar films that regarded present time as "real" and
the future as a fantasy: instead. The War Came treats the present
as a fantasy (at least concerning the adequacy of civil defense
preparations) and the future
it depicts as all too real.
The War Came
is a polemical film arguing that nuclear war
could happen and that civil defense efforts would not protect
people from
its terrible consequences.
It uses an amalgam of
techniques: hand-held shots with conspicuous panning and track-
ing (here cinema verite style
is evoked to enhance the appearance
of "filmed truth") but also music, printed text, and a dominating
voice-over that speaks menacingly in a future conditional tense:
"This could be the way
.
.
.";
"It
is very possible that
.
.
."; "The
results would be
.
.
. almost inevitable." Drawing on data from the
most damaging bombing raids of World War
II, the film drama-
tizes such potential postwar horrors as police shooting severely

wounded casualties, hunger riots, and executions of civilians by
firing squads. Several hundred nonprofessional performers agreed
to participate in the harrowing production, many wearing grue-
some makeup to appear as victims of radiation burns and other
injuries. The BBC refused to broadcast the film, but
it was
released for theatrical exhibition through the British Film Institute.
The Sorrow and the Pity
Another documentary made for television but banned from
broadcast— at least in the country that was
its subject—was Le
Chagrin et la pitie {The Sorrow and the Pity, 1969), directed by
Marcel Ophuls (b. 1927). Son of the German emigre director Max
Ophuls, the filmmaker was born in Germany and raised in France
and the United States. In the 1960s he directed feature fiction
films in France and worked for German and French television
networks as a journalist and documentary filmmaker. An
independent production. The Sorrow and the Pity was financed
by German and Swiss television.
It focused on the experience of
World War
II in a French town, Clermont-Ferrand. The complete
version ran four and one-half hours in two parts. French television
refused to consider the work, and
it was released in theaters as a
single film cut to just over four hours. In the United States, where
it was among the longest films to play in commercial exhibition
up to that time,
it also was nominated for an Academy Award as a
feature documentary.
The Sorrow and the Pity examined the myths of French politics
and daily
life under the Vichy regime, after France's defeat by
Germany. Ophuls and his crew shot some sixty hours of inter-
views among townspeople with different social backgrounds and
politFcal viewpoints, from collaborators with the Nazis to resis-
tance fighters. They interspersed selections from the interviews
with archival and newsreel footage from the war period.
In
its
slow accumulation of detail. The Sorrow and the Pity became not
a collage like In the Year of the Pig but a meditation, not a
polemic but an elegy. The controversy
it evoked arose from
its
insistence on looking behind the legends and discovering that evil
existed and suffering could be terrible, that history
is more often
grievous than heroic.
Tokyo Olymf^iad
The major feature documentary of the 1960s decade not funded
by or intended for television was Tokyo Orimpikku {Tokyo
Olympiad, 1965), a widescreen color film produced by the
Japanese company Toho and directed by Kon Ichikawa (b. 1915),
a prominent filmmaker who previously had made more than forty
fiction features in a twenty-year career. The occasion was the
1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, the first time this event had been
held in Asia, as the voice-over narration repeats several times.
The production unit employed over five hundred people, used
more than one hundred cameras, and shot seventy hours of film,
which Ichikawa edited into a two-part film running just under
three hours.
It was an enormous box office success and ranked
number two in the Japanese critics' poll of best films of the year.
Inevitably Tokyo Olympiad \nv\Xes comparison with Leni
Riefenstahl's Olympia (see Chapter

). ichikawa's film quietly
evokes memories of the earlier work when, at the end, after a
Japanese runner has finished third in the marathon run, the voice-
over remarks that the Japanese flag was being raised in the main

avoid nationalistic fervor, giving emphasis instead to new African
nations participating in the Games for the first time after gaining
independence: the most intimate sequence concerns a runner
from Chad, a country four years old that sent two athletes and a
coach. Though Japanese athletes are shown competing for— and
sometimes winning— gold medals in gymnastics, wrestling, box-

By the 1960s, Canada was perhaps the
last country to rennain steadfast— or at
least -bureaucratically committed— to the
vision of government-sponsored docu-
mentary filmmaking that had animated
figures such as John Crierson in Great
Britain and Pare Lorentz in the United
States during the 1930s (see Chapter 11
).
State production was a fixture, to be sure,
in socialist countries, and elsewhere gov-
ernment agencies produced films to
further policies and programs, but
Canada's National Film Board (NFB),
founded in 1939 by Crierson, retained and
even strengthened
its purpose (in the
words of a 1950 National Film Act) to
"promote the production and distribution
of films designed to interpret Canada to
Canadians and to other nations."

The political and social turbulence of
the 1960s, however, posed tests for the
coexistence of state sponsorship with film-
makers' free expression. One such test
was the NFB series "Challenge for
Change" inaugurated by filmmaker Colin
Low (b. 1926)
in 1967, whose aim was to
give people who were the subjects of
documentary films the power to shape the
content and form of those films.
In 1969
the government formally mandated
"Challenge for Change" to make films "to
prepare Canadians for social change."
Nevertheless, most films made for the
series were traditional advocacy docu-
mentaries in which filmmakers maintained
control of film technology and their sub-
jects expressed their viewpoints by
speaking on camera. American filmmaker
George C. Stoney, a producer for the
series, was criticized when he actually put
cameras in the hands of Mohawk Indians,
who then staged a demonstration while
making a film. You Are on Indian Land
(1969).
Another test came with the growth of
political radicalism and nationalist feeling
in Quebec. Filmmakers at the NFB's
French-language unit in Montreal had
gained international recognition for docu-
mentary techniques that presaged cinema
verite and direct cinema, and their nonfic-
tion films became increasingly political
in
the 1960s. "It would long remain one of
the most contradictory historical facts that
this boisterous birth of a 'national'
Quebecois cinema occurred inside a
Canadian government apparatus, which
never intended
it and always renounced
it," Quebecois film critic Real La Rochelle
has written. Matters came to a head in
1970 with what Canadian film historian
Peter Morris has called "the most notori-
ous example of direct NFB censorship,"
when the NFB banned On est au coton, a
feature documentary on Quebec textile
workers by Denys Arcand (b. 1941), on
the grounds that
it promoted class warfare
and national disunity; the film was finally
released in 1976.
Meanwhile, the NFB continued to pro-
duce innovative documentaries outside
its
political controversies. Michael Rubbo (b.
1938) made several self-reflexive feature
documentaries, including Waiting for
Fidel {^974),
in which the filmmaker visits
Cuba with a Canadian politician and a
media baron, who never quite get to meet
their host, Cuban President Fidel Castro.

ing, judo, and women's volleyball, the images convey a viewpoint
quite different from the conventional:
it
is as
if these athletes
experience the agony of victory, and the glory of defeat. A
sequence depicting Japan's triumph over the Soviet Union in the
women's volleyball final, for example, only briefly shows the play-
ers' elation after the winning point; this
is followed by lengthier
shots of the Japanese team's male coach standing by himself,
looking awkward and downcast, and then of the Japanese players
crying, with somber music on the soundtrack.
By the end of the 1960s the innovations of cinema verite and
direct cinema had redefined and been incorporated into standard
documentary film practice. Nonfiction filmmaking continued to
thrive into the 1970s,
in the framework of the styles and tech-
niques of the previous decade, though without
its larger claims of
"filmed truth." Hand-held cameras with synchronized sound gave
new life to the documentary' of political advocacy, of which the
most notable work of the 1970s was La Batalla de Chile
( The
Battle of Chile, 1975-79) a three-part film directed by the Chilean
filmmaker Patricio Guzman (b. 1941) on the political struggles in
his country culminating in 1973 with the military overthrow of the
government of Salvador Allende; imprisoned in Chile after the
1973 coup, Guzman went into exile the following year and com-
pleted the film in Cuba.
The rise of the feminist movement in the United States, as well
as the end of the era of McCarthyism, fostered a form of advocacy
filmmaking that often involved autobiography, biography, and his-
torical reminiscence, rediscovering the forgotten or suppressed
histories of feminist and radical political movements in the
American past.
It was not a fallow time, as the period from World
War
II to the 1960s can be described, so much as a time of retro-
spection and revision, an effort to find out what remained valid or
vital from the past, as part of moving forward.

TWENTY
MERICAN
AND TRANS
The image of the United States in the 1960s, even more than for
many other countries,
is of sweeping cultural and social change.
In the popular imagination the era begins in hope and ends in
tragedy, marred by political assassinations, the quagmire and con-
flict of the Vietnam war, and growing racial confrontation; while
drugs, a sexual revolution, and rock 'n'
roll transform the moral
landscape. All these phenomena did
in fact occur, but when, and
whom did they affect? The watershed years of "the sixties,"
broadly speaking, were concentrated late in the decade, and their
most profound effect was on young people. Like many other
established cultural institutions, American commercial films
lagged far behind the vanguard of change. Even as the Hollywood
studios began to participate fully in exploring and representing
new trends, they were going through one of the worst economic
periods in their history.
Indeed, while the 1960s marked an era of widespread achieve-
ment in world cinema— with new wave movements in France
and Japan, Brazil's Cinema Novo, a cinema of liberation, and
important documentaries, among others— for the United States
film industry
it was a decade largely of crisis. We have already
seen how the introduction
in the mid-1950s of technological
innovations such as widescreen only temporarily halted the post-
war decline in motion picture attendance. Average weekly atten-
dance began to stabilize in the 1960s, at less than half the
numbers even of the 1950s. By the mid-1960s operating "four-
wall" (enclosed) movie theaters numbered less than half the figure
of 1945.
In 1963 some 121 feature fiction films were produced in
the United States, an all-time low.
The American motion picture industry was becoming vulner-
able to external economic forces to an extent not encountered
since the early years of the Great Depression. Through decades of
internal struggles and change, many Hollywood studios had
remained rocks of stability: Jack
L. Warner had supervised pro-
duction at Warner Bros, for more than forty years (1923-67), and
other motion picture executives held leadership positions for
nearly as long. But in the 1960s, weakened economically, the
studios became takeover targets. In 1962 MCA Inc., the talent
agency, gained control of Universal. Paramount was acquired by
Gulf -I- Western
in 1966, United Artists by the Transamerica
Corporation
in 1967. Warner Bros, merged with Seven Arts
Productions
in 1967 and was taken over two years later by Kinney
National Service Corporation. These changes marked the begin-
ning of frequent corporate realignments that have continued for
decades.
416

Despite dismal statistics and management turnover, Hollywood
remained the world's most powerful and influential film produc-
tion center. As filmmakers, the movie companies responded to
their multiple challenges mainly by accentuating a defensive posi-
tion. In the early 1960s they became committed more than ever
to the 1950s "prestige" picture mentality, concentrating on big-
budget genre extravaganzas based on popular Broadway
musicals, novels, and classic stories. Twentieth Century-Fox
scored the greatest success with this strategy and also suffered the
biggest disaster.
Its 1965 production The Sound of Music, directed
by Robert Wise (b. 1914), became the outstanding box office tri-
umph
in film history up to that time, nearly doubling the receipts
of the previous leader, M-C-M's 6en-Hur (1959). But Fox also lost
more than $10 million on a single picture, Cleopatra (1963),
which with a production cost of $37 million may rank,
in real dol-
lar terms, as the most expensive motion picture in cinema history.
THE EARLY 1960S
The early years of the 1960s are a neglected period in American
film history, a time with no clear direction. Movements and gen-
res from film noir to the family melodrama had lost their force,
and beneath the top layer of expensive "prestige" pictures the
codes of moviemaking that had shaped Hollywood's mode of
popular filmmaking through the sound era appeared in question.
Amid the uncertainty, a few bold cinematic endeavors stood out.
John Ford
The veteran director John Ford, who had made his first Western in
1917, was among a handful of pioneers entering his sixth decade*
of active filmmaking— others included Raoul Walsh (1887-1980)
and Allan Dwan (1885-1981). In the 1960s Ford opened to ques-
tion the conventions of the Western genre in which he had
worked and, by implication, the historical myths of the American
west. Sergeant Rutledge (1960), though a melodramatic film con-
cerning a black cavalry soldier falsely accused of a crime, had the
merit of bringing more prominently to the screen the role of
African-Americans in western expansion; Woody Strode (b. 1914)
portrayed Sgt. Braxton Rutledge. Cheyenne Autumn (1964) nar-
rated the desperate effort of a small group of Cheyenne Indians to
escape a reservation and return to their home territory. In their
context, these were unusual attempts to revise the standard treat-
ment of racial issues in the Western genre.
The Man Who Shot Liberty Va/ance (1962) more broadly con-
sidered the myths of European expansion in the West—the idea
of how a "wilderness" was transformed into a society. While
Sergeant Rutledge, Cheyenne Autumn, and Ford's other Westerns
of the period were photographed in color. The Man Who Shot

417

Liberty Valance was black-and-white.
Its mood was elegiac,
its
visual tones dark. The cast included performers who had
appeared
in Ford Westerns since the 1930s and were themselves
icons of Western mythology, such as John Wayne, Andy Devine
(1905-1977), and John Carradine (b. 1906). A United States
senator (played by James Stewart) returns to the town of Shinbone
for a funeral.
In flashback, to newspapermen, he recounts the
town's story. As a young attorney, he had championed the law
against violence (personified by the symbolically named outlaw.
Liberty Valance). Ironically, however, his rise to eminence was
based on a mistaken belief that he had killed the outlaw. At the
end of his story, when he asks that the truth be told, a newsman
replies, "This
is the West,
sir. When the legend becomes fact,
print the legend." Yet as many critics have pointed out. Ford
"prints" both sides. The film suggests the inevitability of legends,
but also their costs in deception and inauthenticity, for individuals
as for history.
Alfred Hitchcock
Another veteran, whose career stretched back nearly as many
years as Ford's, Alfred Hitchcock created in The Birds (1963) per-
haps the most enigmatic and protean of his more than fifty films.
It carried to a further level the suspense and menace found
in
Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960);
its external action was more
spectacular,
its psychological motifs more elusive.
In genre terms.
The Birds draws on horror and science fiction: birds such as
crows, sea gulls, and sparrows flock together and attack humans
in the bucolic setting of Bodega Bay, north of San Francisco. Yet
the film does not quite adhere to these traditional genres— it
offers neither explanation nor resolution.
The Birds was a triumph of technique, deriving in part from
new sound technology. The film utilized no background music;
instead composer Bernard Herrmann shaped a soundtrack from
natural and electronic sounds, almost as a score. Rapid montage

and startling overhead shots— as
it from "bird's eye" view— con-
tribute to the film's unsettling effect on spectators. The Birds was
not a political film but
it pointed to underlying concerns about the
fragility of the planet. The film marked a subtle shift from the sci-
ence fiction films of the 1950s that conveyed social and political
themes allegorically through fantasy elements, such as the alien
pods of Invasion of the Body Snatchers or the giant ants mutated
through atomic radiation in Them! The Birds locates
its sense of
anxiety more subtly within everyday
life, implying that humans
more generally may be responsible for disrupting the order of
nature, and that nature will take
its revenge.
Politics and Film
Like The Birds, the films that revived the subject matter of con-
temporary politics in the eaHy 1960s did not inject fantastic
elements into everyday
life so much as they regarded everyday
life as
if
it were itself fantastic. The period's groundbreaking work
was The Manchurian Candidate (1962), directed by John
Frankenheimer (b. 1930). Based on a popular novel, the film took
up the theme of what historians have called "the paranoid style of
American politics."
It opens during the Korean conflict of the
early 1950s and gradually reveals a bizarre episode of brainwash-
ing— a term used to describe the enemy's efforts forcibly to
indoctrinate prisoners of war. The incident
is part of a Communist
plot to gain control of the United States presidency, with the
mother of a brainwashed soldier as the secret agent at the core of
the plan. The film culminates in a tense sequence at a national
political party convention, where the ex-soldier, after discovering
how he has been duped and used, assassinates his mother and
her husband, a candidate, with a long-range rifle, then takes his
own
life. Variety's reviewer proclaimed that The Manchurian
Candidate "restores a topical excitement to American films which
has been almost totally lacking.
.
.
."' However, after the assassi-
nation of President John
F. Kennedy in November 1963, the film
was withdrawn and was not rereleased until the late 1980s.
With The Manchurian Candidate quickly out of circulation, the
film that became emblematic of a new political viewpoint was Dr
Strangelove, or How
I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the
Bomb (1964). Director Stanley Kubrick (b. 1928) took a subject of
even greater worldwide portent, nuclear holocaust, and treated
it
as satiric black comedy. Another avatar of the "paranoid style," a
demented air force general, persuaded that the "international
communist conspiracy"
is out to sap and impurify "all of our pre-
cious bodily fluids," sends a squadron of nuclear bombers on a
preemptive strike against the Soviet Union. As political and mili-
tary leaders strive to prevent catastrophe, a host of contemporary
attitudes are mocked: cold war posturing, macho militarism,
hand-wringing liberalism, Russians and Americans alike. Perhaps
the film's most chilling aspect
is not the absurd behavior
it
parodies but
its representation of conventional behavior: the
matter-of-fact professionalism and ingenuity with which the last
surviving bomber crew, against all obstacles, manages to drop a
bomb on a target. The film ends with a shot of a mushroom cloud
from a nuclear explosion while on the soundtrack are heard the
lyrics of a sentimental popular song, "We'll meet again, don't
know where, don't know when.

standard political wisdom of the era with
its grim humor as effec-
tively as few other films in the history of world cinema.

MOVIES AND SOCIAL
MOVEMENTS
In general, the American film industry was unprepared for the
accelerating pace of change
in the 1960s. During the Great
Depression and World War
II, Hollywood had demonstrated a
remarkable capacity to shape social myths and mediate percep-
tions of public events through memorable narrative fictions;
in the
early 1960s, however, that skill was not available. Turnover in
management and continuing box office decline left the studios
with inexperienced leadership and an uncertain sense of their
audience. Producers favored Broadway musicals and historical
costume dramas. Young people turned to the emerging culture of
rock music for their social myths and viewpoints on public
events.
The Civil Rights Movement
Of all the contemporary movements for social change,
Hollywood was perhaps least able to respond to the civil rights
movement. The struggle of black Americans that had surged in
the late 1950s and early 1960s in protest against racial segregatio.
soon expanded into a wider effort to improve social conditions
and enhance economic opportunity. A historic turning point was
a 1963 march on Washington, D.C., where the Rev. Martin Luther
King,
Jr., delivered a famous speech with the repeated words "I
have a dream" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. These events
marked a challenge to the United States film industry.
It had
traditionally followed a so-called southern strategy of avoiding
subjects or scenes that might disturb dominant white racial atti-
tudes; this was justified on the grounds that otherwise exhibitors
in southern states would cut prints or reject films entirely. The stu-
dios offered generalized appeals for racial understanding, such as
Lilies of the Field (^963), concerning a black workman who helps
European nuns build a chapel
in the desert. African-American
actor Sidney Poitier (b. 1924) won an Academy Award for best
actor for his performance in the film, but there was little of "topi-
cal excitement"— of direct engagement with contemporary
issues— in such works.

Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger), learns
to get along with black
Philadelphia police detective
Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier).
The first 1960s film to significantly treat contemporary black
themes was a non-Hollywood independent production, Nothing
but a Man (1965), which was also important for demonstrating
that feature fiction films made outside the dominant mainstream
could achieve commercial success.
It was a collaboration
between Michael Roemer (b. 1928), credited as director, and
Robert Young (b. 1925), credited as cinematographer; experienced
documentary filmmakers working on their first feature film, they
raised production money from individual investors and a film lab-
oratory. The film centers on the efforts of a black couple (played
by Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln) to establish
life as a family
in a small southern town. Through understated daily events
it
evokes the pain and loss in lives deprived of dignity and human
rights. This small film remains a pioneering work on the African-
American experience.
Hollywood and Racial Issues
Hollywood's breakthrough on racial subjects came in 1967, with
the Academy Award-winning best picture. In the Heat of the
Night, directed by Norman Jewison (b. 1926), and the year's sec-
ond lop box office success, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner^,
directed by Stanley Kramer (b. 1913). These did not focus on the
African-American experience in the manner of Nothing hut a
Man; rather, their narratives concern hostile whites finding racial
reconciliation by encountering a superior black individual, who
is
the only prominent black character in the films. This figure was
portrayed
in both works by Poitier,
in In the Heat of the Night as a
northern homicide detective who gets involved in a murder inves-
tigation
in a southern town,
in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner^
as a scientist engaged to a white woman. Poitier wears a suit and
tie in almost all his scenes in both films.
The Graduate
The surprise hit of 1967-68 was The Graduate (released
in late
1967), directed by Mike Nichols (b. 1931
).
It was second only to
The Sound of Music in box office receipts for the 1960s. The film
struck a chord as no other work of the era with the "baby boom"
generation of young people born after World War
II who were in
college during the 1960s. A twenty-year-old college graduate
returns to the materialistic milieu of his parents and falls into an
affair with the wife of his father's partner. Despite hard work and
scholastic honors, his
life seems without purpose.
"It's like I've
been playing some kind of game," he says, "but the rules don't
make any sense to me. They've been made up by all the wrong
people.
I mean no one makes them up. They seem to have made
themselves up." With soundtrack music by Simon and Garfunkel
and an acclaimed performance by actor Dustin Hoffman (b. 1937)
as the mordant youth. The Graduate seemed to speak for a
generation that was raised in affluence but found itself facing an
uncertain future.
Demise of the Code
The Graduate's affair between a young man and a married older
woman was one of many signs in the mid-1960s that the moral
prohibitions of the Motion Picture Production Code, monitored
since 1934 by the Production Code Administration, had become a
dead letter for Hollywood filmmakers. The Code had been under
challenge since the 1950s, when works of the international art
cinema gained prestige and critical praise with their more sophis-
ticated treatment of sexuality. By the 1960s, the social consensus
that supported the Code had collapsed. Sexual candor was more
apparent in advertising,
literature, and public behavior. Not only
international art films but also independent low-budget "exploita-
tion" films, featuring nudity and sexual escapades, provided
increasing box office competition.
In periods of economic
distress, such as this one was for the motion picture industry, pro-
ducers habitually turned to sensational content in an effort to
attract patrons.
In 1966 lack Valenti, a former special assistant to
President Lyndon B. Johnson, became head of the Motion Picture
Association of America, the producers' organization that operated
the Code, and began an effort to arrive at a new self-regulation
device.
The Rating System
The outcome was the replacement of the Code in 1968 by a rat-
ing system, modeled after similar systems in Britain and other
countries. The original ratings included "G" for general audience;
"M," suggested for mature audiences— adults and mature young
people; "R," restricted, persons under 16 years admitted only with
an adult; and "X", no one under 16 admitted. These have been
periodically revised, so that "M" became "PC," to stress the
importance of "parental guidance" in young people's choice of
motion pictures, and then was divided into "PC" and "PG-13,"
while "X" was replaced
in the early 1990s by "NC-17" to avoid
stigmatizing Hollywood commercial films with a label that had
been eagerly claimed by pornographic works.
422

A Code and Rating Administration took over from the
Production Code Administration and looked at finished films
rather than super\'ising scripts, Ivrics, and costumes, as the PC.\
had done.
Its ratings were ad\ isorv for parents rather than manda-
tor,' for exhibitors: whether ticket sellers \ igilantK enforced the
age limitations or requirements for adult accompaniment
is op>en
to question, though man\ theater operators refused to book films
rated "X." The rating categories reflected specific standards with
regard to such subjects as profanit> or illicit sex, but overall their
application has seemed arbitrary to many filmgoers: gruesome
violence does not disqualif\ a film from a "PC" rating, uhile film-
makers and ratings administrators haggle over a few frames of
sexual explicitness that demarcate an "R" from an "NC-IZ"
The ''Film Generation''
The Graduate's success also seemed to signal renewed excite-
ment about cinema among college-age vouth. The voung
audience's tastes and preferences had an immediate impact, even
on reviewers' judgments. The prime example was Bonnie and
Clyde i^967K directed by Arthur Penn ib. 1922), produced by and
starring the young actor Warren Beatty (b. 1938i.

f-<rom f-KKflottatwn to
exploitation
In the lexicon of the film industry, the
term "exploitation" originally described
special forms of publicity or promotion
for example, people dressed
in costumes
standing outside theaters to attract atten-
tion. Since the 1930s, however, a second
meaning for the term has become domi-
nant: low-budget independent films
dealing with subjects made taboo by the
Production Code, such as drugs and sex
hygiene.
Exploitation films flourished
in the
1950s as production declined at the
major studios. They became regular fare
at many drive-ins and small theaters
catering especially to young audiences
looking for thrills and titillation. A rela-
tively mild version (in historical hindsight)
was the "teenpic" genre of the era, deal-
ing with high school rebels, which was
more transgressive in advertising posters
than in the films themselves.
"Many of the films are overtly 'lower-
class' or 'low-brow'
in content or art
direction," write V. Vale and Andrea Juno
in their introduction to a book on
exploitation films. Incredibly Strange
Films. "However, a high percentage of
these works disdained by the would-be
dictators of public opinion are sources of
pure enjoyment and delight [their italics],
despite improbable plots, 'bad' acting, or
ragged film technique. At issue
is the
notion of 'good taste,' which functions as
a
filter to block out entire areas of experi-
ence judged— and damned— as
unworthy of investigation."
What has been labeled a "break-
through" in the exploitation field came in
1959 when Russ Meyer (b. 1922), a pho-
tographer for Playboy magazine, directed
The Immoral Mr
Teas, concerning a man
who has the ability to view women in
everyday life as
if they were nude (the
spectator, of course, sees what he sees).
Through the 1960s exploitation films
broke down the boundaries of sexual sub-
ject matter along with, but consistently
ahead of, Hollywood films; the genre of
taboo topics merged with the mainstream
when Meyer, "King of the Nudies,"
directed Beyond the Valley of the Dolls
(1970) for Twentieth Century-Fox.
By the 1970s exploitation had largely
become sexploitation—and transgression
had turned into pornography, defined as
"soft-core" or "hard-core" depending on
the degree of explicitness. As critic jim
Morton has written, "there
is no true con-
tinuum from early exploitation films to
modern hardcore porn." The former was
always intended for a theatrical audience,
while the latter grew out of pornographic
films screened privately at clubs and
parties. Despite efforts to prosecute film-
makers or exhibitors of pornographic
films (sometimes successfully), hard-core
became big business in the 1970s, play-
ing openly in theaters in many parts of
the country. With the advent of video-
cassette players, however, the genre
shifted to video and became once again
a private affair.

lar rock songs as the music score, this low-budget film served as a
primer to the counterculture of the late 1960s, as two drug deal-

they meet a brutal destiny on a highway in the American South.

an "X" rating, but that did not deter
it from box office success and
an Academy Award as best picture. The film also introduced
spectators to the urban counterculture when the protagonists
attend a party at the Factory, the loft-studio of artist and indepen-
dent filmmaker Andy Warhol (see Chapter 23).
Political Films
in the midst of the divisive political struggles of the late 1960s,
it
was less likely that filmmakers could construct popular fictions on
the issues that offered the originality and appeal of works like The
Manchurian Candidate or Dr. Strangelove. The era's convulsive
event, the Vietnam war, was largoK avoided as a subject by
American feature filmmakers for over a decade. The principal
exception was The Creen Berets (1968), starring John Wavne,
who also co-directed with Ray Kellogg. Wa\no portrays a U.S.
Army special forces colonel who persuades a skeptical newspa-
perman of the soundness of United States policy in Vietnam.
From a different political viewpoint, cinematographer Haskell
Wexler (b. 1926) made his debut as a director with Medium Cool
(1969). The film combines actuality footage of protests at the 1968
Democratic party national convention in Chicago with a fictional
story of a television cameraman whose attitude that his work
is
simply technical
is altered by his discovery of the moving image's
ideological power and political complicity.
GENRE REVISION
The revision of genres was Holl\'wot)d's form of participation
in the cultural tumult of the late 1960s. Nearly everywhere in
American society the fundamental tenets of social relations and
ideologv were being held up to scrutin\'; HolK'wood's version
of such basic doctrines was the traditional system of genres. Of
course, genres had always lent themselves to interrogation.
Though marked b\' codes and conventions. the\' had also been
malleable and open, able to accommodate through allegory
issues too hot to handle in direct realist form. In a sense (and con-
trary to views holding genres to be locked into rigid formulas or
organic phases), genre ro\ isii^n had been gtiing on throughout the
history of genres, a constats and continuing process keeping
genres vigorous through selt-critique and self-parodv. But genre
revision
in the late
l^>(>Os drew greater attention, liecause ot
its
involvement in the era's cultural debates, as well as
its role in the
film industry's period of crisis.
427

20. 18. Sam Peckinpah's The
Wild Bunch (1969) considerably
raised the level of graphic vio-
lence in mainstream Hollywood
features; here Warren Oates as
Lyie Gorch and Ben Johnson as
Tector Corch take part in a
bloody battle.
The Western
Nowhere was this more clearly seen than with Western films. As
the civil rights movement at home expanded from African-
Americans to other minority groups, including American Indians,
the Vietnam war overseas opened up questions about historical
conflicts over territorial expansion and warfare against indigenous
nonwhite peoples.
If few films other than The Green Berets con-
cerned Vietnam directly, nevertheless the war entered movies
allegorically through the Western, while
it cast new light on the
historical American West. Freed from Production Code restric-
tions, issues of violence and racism entered the late 1960s
Western film
in ways that made John Ford's earlier self-critique
seem tentative by comparison.
THE WILD BUNCH.
Directed by Sam Peckinpah (1925
1984), The Wild Bunch (1969) made Bonnie and Clyde's
treatment of violence appear tame. At the same time,
it presented
a strikingly different viewpoint on violence: whereas in Bonnie
and Clyde violence grew out of social disorder,
in The Wild
Bunch violence appeared fundamental to human behavior. Under
the title credits young boys and girls watch
in awe and delight as
red ants attack and
kill a scorpion, and children figure in the film
as both victims and perpetrators of violence. The film opens and
concludes with the most graphically bloody scenes yet to appear
in an American film. Vietnam
is an unspoken presence as the
work (set in 1914 along the border of Texas and Mexico) places
its
American protagonists, aging outlaws, across the border in the
midst of the Mexican revolution, which
is depicted as a civil war
of guerrilla fighters against corrupt generals.
A technical tour de force, utilizing slow-motion shots and intri-
cate editing to convey
its brutal images of war and death. The
Wild Bunch remains controversial even as
its graphic violence has
become more commonplace in cinema. Some critics hail
it as the
greatest Western ever made; others note
its racism and misogyny,
as well as an uncompelling narrative.
428

LITTLE BIG
A I -A ,\
. The director of Bonnie and Clyde, Arthur
Penn, turned to Western revision in Little Big Man (1970). The
film combines the picaresque tale, the Western tall stor\', and a
more serious effort to reimagine the historical West through the
reminiscences of Jack Crabb, who claims to be 121 years old and
the only white survivor of the epic defeat of the U.S. cavalr\ com-
manded by Gen. George Armstrong Custer b\ Indians at the
Battle of the Little Bighorn. Portrayed bv Dustin Hoffman, Jack
is
a survivor of an Indian raid who
is reared as a member of the
Cheyenne tribe. There he learns to \iew other whites as strange
creatures who "do not seem to know where the center of the
earth
is," as his adoptive grandfather. Chief Old Lodge Skins, tells
him. Little Big Man
is one of se\eral films from the period that
sought to redress Hollywood's traditional treatment of Indians as
murderous savages. Instead
it brings to the foreground actual
instances of atrocities against Indian women and children com-
mitted by U.S. forces in the historical West.
Robert Altman
Director Robert Altman (b. 1925) emerged in the early 1970s
almost as a one-man show of genre revision. He took on, among
others, the war film, the Western, and the detective genre in a
critically acclaimed series of films between 1970 and 1975. His
feature film MM'S'/-/ (19701 retains
its striking originality, even
though
its characters and setting attained worldwide familiarity
through a weekly series of the same name that became one of
the most popular shows in American television history. With an
Academy Award-winning screenplav bv Ring Lardner,
Jr.
(b. 1915), one of the formerly blacklisted Hollywood Ten (see
Chapter 14), the film brought together the Vietnam era's disillu-
sionment, Hollvwood's new candor about sex and violence, and
the stylistic daring of the European art film to create a surreal dark
comedv of war. Displacing
its themes from
its own times to
the early 1950s, at a mobile army surgical hospital during the
Korean war, the film reflexively comments on
its own genre
vood^s Jndiani
Historically speaking, Hollywood's racism
has been no worse—though also no bet-
ter—than the racism in other modes of
communication, such as newspapers or
school textbooks. But in representing
Native Americans, feature films, as a stor\-
telling form, ma\ ha\e had incalculably
greater influence on cultural perceptions
than other media. Indians have not
"merely" been cast as marginal, stereo-
t\ ped figures, as have other ethnic and
minorit\' groups. Rather, in the most sig-
nificant popular narrative of United States
histor>', they pla> a central role, as The
Enemy, whose defeat and decimation are
necessan,' conditions for fulfillment of the
nations destin\.
"We have seen the tipi and the buffalo
hunt, the attack on the wagon train and
the ambush of the stagecoach until they
are scenes so totallv ingrained in the
American consciousness as to be s\ non\-
mous with the very concept of the
American Indian (to non-Indian minds at
any rate and, unfortunately, to many
fndian minds as well)," writes Ward
Churchill, of Creek and Cherokee Metis
background, a critic and essayist in
American Indian studies. Churchill points
out that the representation of American
Indians in Hollywood movies
is largeK
confined to the place and time of the
European population's westward expan-
sion, from the 1820s to the 1880s on the
Great Plains. "There
is no 'before' to this
stor>'," he suggests, "and there
is no
'after.'
Historians of the Western genre have
often seen a progressive trend in the rep-
resentation of Indians after World War
II,
beginning with films such as Broken
Arroiv(1950), directed by Delmer Daves,
and Apache (1954), directed by Robert
Aldrich, and continuing through the
period of broader genre revision of the
late 1960s-early 1970s. "The Western's
increasing emphasis on frontier discrimi-
nation against the Indian paralleled
grouing contemporar\
sensitivity about
social injustice toward blacks," film histo-
rian John H. Lenihan has written.
From the Indian perspective articulated
by Churchill, however, this viewpoint
offers little comfort. He argues that even
films purporting "to provide an
accurate
and sympathetic treatment of the
-American Indian' lof yester\ear)" are
shaped by a "Eurocentric" perspective,
almost always with non-Indians cast in
major Indian roles, and often with the
narrative told through a European's view-
point. He does not exempt from this
critique revisionist Westerns such as
Soldier Blue 0970). directed bv Ralph
Nelson; A Man Called Horse 0970),
directed bv Elliot Sikerstein; and Little Big
Man. "To date,
all claims to the contrar\'
notwithstanding," Churchill writes, "there
has not been one attempt to put out a
commercial film which deals with native
realiU through native eves."
Churchill concedes that Dances With
Wolves (1991
), directed by and starring
Kevin Costner, was a breakthrough pro-
duction, with Indians cast in Indian roles
more than ever before in a HollsAvood
film. Nevertheless, this too. in his eves,
is
a Eurocentric film, a "Lawrence of South
Dakota" to stand beside films of empire
such as Lawrence of Arabia.

films screening at the hospital camp. At the end the loudspeaker
barks out, "Tonight's movie has been M*A*S*H. Follow the zany
antics of our combat surgeons as they cut and stitch their way
along the front lines"— a mordant commentary on war and
its
transformation into cinematic entertainment.
SOUND INNOVATIONS.
In addition to
its contrasting visual
style, with sharp cuts from humor to moments of crisis, M*A*S*H
gave emphasis to new styles in sound editing that had developed
in the 1960s and gained particular prominence in Altman's work.
These included bleeding sound from one image to another, espe-
cially sound that forecast a change of scene; more extended forms
of sound/image juxtaposition; and an overlapping of sounds
so that a medley of voices and background noise or music pre-
vents the spectator/auditor from easily identifying a dominant
communication.
Altman carried this last technique even further in McCabe and
Mrs. Miller {}97]), with Warren Beatty and British actress Julie
Christie (b. 1941). This revisionist Western, set after 1900 in a
Pacific Northwest frontier town, centers on an aspiring small busi-
nessman who runs a saloon and a brothel until he
is destroyed,
literally murdered, by a mining company's hired killers— a frog
swallowed by an eagle,
in one of the film's metaphors. Set mostly
at night, and in snow and rain, the film
is a tragicomedy of a
"lit-
tle guy" who fails to find a miraculous Hollywood happy ending.
Detective Genre
Genre revision was blatant in Altman's The Long Goodbye
(1973), based on a Raymond Chandler novel featuring hard-
boiled detective Philip Marlowe, a figure memorably portrayed on
screen by Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep (1946). Screenwriter
Leigh Brackett (1915-1978), who collaborated on the 1946 clas-
sic, wrote the screenplay for Altman's Marlowe film,
in which the
detective has turned into a bumbling anachronism in 1970s Los
Angeles. Played by Elliott Gould (b. 1938), Marlowe
is confused
and abused until the last moments, when he responds to the
insults of a friend who has betrayed him by pulling out a gun and
calmly shooting the man. The song "Hooray for Hollywood"
sounds over the closing shots.
Kubrick and Science Fiction
Following Dr. Strangelove, director Stanley Kubrick turned to the
science fiction film. Though significant in the 1950s, this
remained a relatively minor genre, associated with B pictures and
movies made for the drive-in audience. Kubrick's 2001: A Space
Odyssey (1968) marked not so much a revision of the genre as a
reinvention. Much of its $11
million production cost went into
special effects cinematography that created spectacular vistas of
spaceships and interplanetary travel and opened new possibilities
for the genre.
Its narrative suggested the necessity for humanity's
rebirth through contact with the unknown of outer (and inner)
space. Partly satirical, partly visionary— and to some critics
murky, pretentious, and overlong (Kubrick cut nineteen minutes
from the film after early unfavorable reviews)
2001: A Space
Odyssey has grown in stature as a landmark work that revived a
genre.
Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971
) was also set in the
future, though
its visionary quality comes through language and
political allegory rather than special visual effects.
It centers on a
youth gang that speaks an argot combining Russian and English
word forms and goes out at night to commit what
its narrator-
protagonist calls "the ultra-violent"— gang fights, robberies, and
assaults. Captured after a murder, the hooligan leader undergoes
behavioral modification treatment designed to make him sick at
the idea of violence (as part of the cure, he
is made to watch
Triumph of the W;7/and Nazi newsreel footage). Ultimately the
government chooses to use his violent character rather than sup-
press
it. Once again Kubrick creates an ambiguous world where
humor coexists with horror, and the film's flamboyance holds
interest beyond
its deficiencies of narrative coherence.
Hollywood Left and Right
It
is always risky to assign political labels like right or left, liberal
or conservative, to commercial fiction films. Most works are open
to multiple interpretations; and the political terms themselves are
often difficult to pin down, especially in relation to fictional narra-
tives. Nevertheless, genre revision does seem clearly linked with
some form of political liberalism. Films that called attention to his-
torical atrocities against Indians (Little Big Man] or the arbitrary
power of large corporations in western development [McCabe
and Mrs. Miller) addressed issues that were being raised by protest
groups in American society. The period of genre revision begin-
ning in the late 1960s was among the most politically progressive
eras of Hollywood filmmaking.
Energized by the revisionists, traditional genre films began a
comeback. Paradoxically,
in the framework of revisionist critique,
more conventional works appeared politically conservative. An
example was Dirty Harry (1971
), directed by Don Siegel, previ-
ously best known for the 1956 genre film Invasion of the Body
Snatchers. After years of working in Italian "spaghetti Westerns"
films set in the American West made in Italy during the 1960s by
Italian directors (often using American-sounding pseudonyms)
Clint Eastwood (b. 1930) emerged
in the film as a major star,
portraying San Francisco police inspector Harry Callahan, a fear-
less, independent figure who in previous eras might have pleased
spectators across the political spectrum. Yet many critics regarded
Harry's heroic efforts to stop a deranged killer, in defiance of his
superiors' caution and legalisms, as a form of right-wing extrem-
ism. A more convincing case for the conservatism of conventional
genre films might be made for The Exorcist 0973), directed by
William Friedkin (b. 1939), a film that brought the horror genre
back into first-run theaters.
It posited the weakness of science and
secular reason against demonic evil, which only religious faith
could combat.
THE "MOVIE BRATS"
In the early 1970s Hollywood began to recover from
its economic
crisis. A central factor was a significant shift in marketing strategy.
For decades the film industry had followed a pattern of releasing
films gradually, a few cities at a time. A film's run would last a
year or more as
it slowly passed through the exhibition system,
from larger to smaller theaters. In the early 1970s, the studios
started to utilize national television advertising, and they placed
films in hundreds of theaters throughout the country simultane-
ously, so as to capitalize on the extensive coverage of their
promotional campaigns. People in smaller towns could see first-
run films at the same time as moviegoers in Los Angeles or New
York. Though advertising and print costs were higher, studios

The heroic individualism
of San Francisco police inspector
Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood)
was regarded by many critics as a
form of right-wing extremism in

20.27.
Linda Blair as Regan, pos-
sessed by the devil in The Exorcist
(1973), directed by William
Friedkin, which brought the hor-
ror genre back to first-run theaters
could demand a greater percentage of the box office in return for
making their top pictures available more widely.
Individual films rarely before had held the possibility of creating
such an immediate nationwide mass impact. Could filmmakers
create works that would justify the promotional effort and sustain
audience interest? The revival of traditional genres was clearly
linked,
in part, to these new marketing techniques. But such
genres now carried a greater weight than they had in the past.
Instead of occupying a series of niches appealing to specific audi-
ence tastes (Westerns for men, melodramas for women, and so
forth), they had to appeal broadly across the fragmented
American cultural scene, and especially to the young people who
made up the largest part of the audience.
To answer this need, the studios turned to a surprising source
young filmmakers recently graduated from university filmmaking
programs. In the crisis of the late 1960s the industry had wel-
comed new talent to an extent not seen since the advent of
sound. Among the many first-time directors of that period, the film
school graduates were particularly prepared to make the big-
budget, genre-oriented films the new marketing required. Though
attuned to youth values, they were not primarily rebels or revi-
sionists; their film studies had forged a link with the industry's
past. Looking back a few years
later, writers Michael Pye and
Lynda Miles called them "movie brats, true children of Hollywood
.
.
. heirs to the great tradition of American cinema."^ Principal
figures among them included Francis Ford Coppola (b. 1939), a
graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles; George
Lucas (b. 1944), a graduate of the University of Southern
California; and Martin Scorsese (b. 1942), a graduate of New York
University. An exception to the film school pattern among the
"movie brats" was Steven Spielberg (b. 1947), a self-taught film-
maker who attended California State University at Long Beach.
Francis Ford Coppola
Like a number of other young filmmakers and performers,
Coppola broke into Hollywood by working for independent pro-
ducer Roger Corman (b. 1926), who became a legendary figure
turning out low-budget horror, science fiction, and other B-movie
genre films for drive-ins. Coppola's first major studio assignments
were as a writer, and he shared an Academy Award for the story
and screenplay of Patton (1970), directed by Franklin
J. Schaffner.
In 1969 he founded a production company in San Francisco,
American Zoetrope, named after the precinema moving-image
device. He produced George Lucas's first science fiction film,
THX-1138 (1971
), and meanwhile directed several films for other
companies. Versatile, independent-minded, but ambitious for
success as Hollywood traditionally measured
it, Coppola was a
pioneer and prototype of the new generation.
Still, Paramount
was taking a chance when the studio picked him to cowrite and
direct a "prestige" project, a film based on Mario Puzo's best-sell-
ing novel about an Italian organized crime family, The Godfather.

Francis Ford Coppola's
path-breaking The Godfather
' 1972) briefly held the record as
all-time box office champion.
Marlon Brando (right) portrayed
the leader of an organized crime
family, Don Vito Corleone, and Al
Pacino his son and successor,
Michael.
THE GODFATHER. Coppola faced several challenges. The
"prestige" formula—top stars in big-budget adaptations— had
grown stale, and a number of expensive films had flopped. In any
case, he had only one star, Marlon Brando, and a cast of
unknowns. Organized crime was a highly conventionalized genre
subject. Moreover, The Godfather 0972) was among the first films
marketed under the new strategy of wide simultaneous national
distribution.
It
is difficult to imagine retrospectively that its suc-
cess was not assured, but no one could have imagined the extent
of its triumph.
It more than vindicated the new marketing plan,
surpassing The Sound of Music as the all-time box office leader (a
position
it held only briefly, as The Exorcist and soon other films
went even higher).
Its theme music, by composer Nino Rota, was
heard ever\'where, and the phrase "I'm going to make him an
offer he can't refuse" became part of the language. The Codfather
became an instant classic, not only for its popularity but as a
powerful, path-breaking film.
Coppola depicted the violence and power of organized crime
but also emphasized strong positive values of ethnic heritage
and family loyalt\. The film offered an epic perspective on mid-
twentieth-centur\' American social history and at the same time
was a studv in character and behavior, abetted bv acclaimed per-
formances by Al Pacino (b. 1940i, Robert Duvall (b. 1931 k and
James Caan (b. 1939), as well as Brando. Neither strictly a tradi-
tional genre film nor a revisionist work. The Codfather iused both
impulses into a new genre synthesis, traditional
in stvie, reflective
in tone, that pleased spectators of nearK every outlook.
George Lucas
Coppola served as executive producer on Lucas's American
Cra/m/ (1973), which also became one of the top popular suc-
cesses of the early 1970s. Lucas's film carried further than The
Codfather a mood of nostalgia for seemingly better past times
in the case of American Craffiti, the earlv 1960s. The film's
narrative takes place over one night in 1962
in a California central
valley town, in a teenage car culture of drive-in restaurants, cruis-
ing the main street, and drag-racing at dawn.
It portrays innocent
vouth on the verge of life decisions. Then
it shatters that aura of
innocence with printed texts at the end, indicating what the future
was to hold for some of its fictional protagonists after the narra-
tive's closure (however, only for the males).
Martin Scorsese
After directing several independent features, including one pro-
duced by Corman, Scorsese made his breakthrough with Mean
Streets (1973). Not a box office hit like Coppola's or Lucas's films,
it was highly esteemed by critics.
It centers on voung men in
Manhattan's Little Italy, a neighborhood from which the soaring
Empire State Building can be seen, but which in Scorsese's film
has the claustrophobia and conservatism of an Italian provincial
village. The film's visual stvIe, emphasizing constant, chaotic
movement within dark, enclosed spaces, helps to shape an ethnic
milieu lacking Coppola's epic mvths of organized crime and fam-
ily values and a youth culture without Lucas's nostalgia and
innocent hope. Mean Streets also brought to prominence a young
actor, Robert De Niro (b. 1943), who gave an unusual perfor-
mance as an irresponsible, trouble-making youth.
Steven Spielberg
Youngest of the "brats,
" Spielberg was hired as a television direc-
tor on the strength of a short film he made as a college student.
One of his made-for-television films. Due/ (1971
), was expanded
for release in theaters overseas;
it was a compelling, surreal horror
film concerning a man driving to a business meeting who
is ter-
rorized by an eighteen-wheel tank truck whose driver's face
is
never seen. Spielberg's feature film debut was The Sugarland
Express (1974), a tragicomic genre film in the tradition of road
movies about doomed young couples on the run. With cine-
435

matography by Vilmos Zsigmond, the film was a visual tour-de-
force, choreographing scores of law enforcement vehicles, their
red lights flashing, as
if they were dancers in a Busby Berkeley
musical.
It updated such predecessors as You Only Live Once
(1937) and They Live by Night {]948) by turning the criminal
chase into a 1970s-style media event with crowd participation,
by-standers kissing the fugitives, giving them presents, or stealing
their possessions as souvenirs.
The Sugarland Express made a strong impression and com-
pleted a transition. Hollywood's doldrums of the 1960s were over.
A new generation of filmmakers was in place, confident of a
future for the American motion picture industry whose contours
no one, as yet, could fully imagine.
In the next few years these
filmmakers, along with a few others, would seek to expand the
styles and the box office potential of the genres they had
inherited.

TWENTY-ONE
UROPEAN
1 960S
As film and the twentieth century passed more or less simultane-
ously through the decades, and new mediums like television rose
to challenge the cinema's status, pundits and promoters stopped
speaking of motion pictures as a universal language. Yet the
medium's standard gauge remained— a technological practice
growing in importance, even
if
it was more and more taken for
granted. Throughout the world most feature fiction films, works
intended for theatrical distribution, were shot on 35mm stock (a
few features used 70mm, and avant-garde and documentary film-
makers frequently shot in 16mm or sometimes 8mm). Basically, a
film made anywhere in the world could be taken directly from
its
shipping can, wound onto a projector, and screened almost
everyplace else.
This standardization may appear so familiar as to be not worth
remarking, but
its significance becomes clearer by comparison
with the lack of standardization in television and video. During
the development of commercial television after World War
II,
countries adopted different standards for the medium's screen
image, and these carried over into multiple formats for receiving
sets, cassette recorders, tapes, and other equipment.
Manufacturers exacerbated differences in the marketing of non-
compatible products. These technological barriers are among the
reasons why
it
is not yet possible to speak of a world television
culture in the same manner that we think of cinema as an interna-
tional phenomenon, even as television has become a more
popular and pervasive medium.
THE INTERNATIONAL
MEDIUM
As television's challenge to cinema attendance expanded from the
United States to other countries in the 1960s and 1970s, interna-
tionalization of the film medium also accelerated. This process
dated to cinema's earliest years, when films, financing, theater
ownership, filmmakers, performers, and technicians crossed inter-
national boundaries almost as soon as the first film prints had
come off the drying rack. In the 1960s, however, the phenome-
non became even more widespread and more public:
international co-productions mingled stars (and financing) from
several countries, directors and performers worked
in a number of
countries (and languages) without emigrating or changing their
citizenship, as had been more commonly the case in the interna-
tional movement of film personnel.

FILMS OF THE
AND
1 970S
Carl Th. Dreyer
A living model of the international filmmaker was Carl Th. Dreyer,
a pioneer (like John Ford) whose career had begun in the World
War
I era and continued into the 1960s. The Danish director had
begun as a scriptwriter when Denmark's film industry was one of
the most powerful in Europe, but the war closed
its markets, and
bv the time Drever began directing his countr\ 's prominence had
passed. He was able to make only fourteen films in a career cov-
ering more than five decades (just five after the advent of sound I,
and fullv half of those outside Denmark, in Germany, France,
Sweden, and Nor\%a\. Dre\er, however, was perhaps one of a
kind, a filmmaker whom few others would be tempted to emulate.
The final film of his career. Cerfrudd 964 1, released when he
was sevent\'-five years old, made that point forcefulK. Based on a
1906 play, the film consists almost entirely of long-take scenes
(fewer than ninet\ individual shots for a nearlv two-hour film) in
which the camera rarel\ pans or mo\es, and the performers are
equally immobile. Produced in Denmark and premiered in
France, the film was sharpK attacked b\
critics in both countries
as "uncinematic." For others, howe\er,
its paucitv of montage or
movement serves to heighten
its emotional intensit\' (and, rather
than standing outside the boundaries of acceptable filmmaking
practices, to expand those boundaries, like an avant-garde film).
Gertrud's title character
is a woman who rejects men who she
feels cannot love her completely, though such complete love
means to her suffering and unhappiness. She finds solace in work
and solitude, \et holds firm to her belief in Amor Omnia: Love
is
Everything. The film's powerful contradictions—moving images
that hardiv move, love that
is everything but seems unattainable
are apt correlati\es for a work looking simultaneously forward
and backward; for spectators who can appreciate those contradic-
tions. Cerfrud can be among their most memorable tllmgoing
experiences.
THE QUESTION OF
NATIONAL CINEMA
The growing internationalization of film production made even
more problematic the question of national cinema. Though coun-
tries no longer blatantK protected their own film industries
through quotas and other restrictive practices, manv were still
concerned with promoting film production as a means of address-
ing national histor\ and cultural values in a popular medium. Yet
441

both prestige and profits could be greater
if films attracted the
interest of the international market. In a further twist, filmmakers
who succeeded internationally would soon be invited to expand
their horizons beyond the nation, toward co-productions, or to
the mecca, Hollywood.
British Cinema
A perennial case study for the question of national cinema
is
Britain, where filmmaking for decades had been subordinated to
Hollywood domination. During World War
II patriotism had fos-
tered a national spirit in British films. By the 1950s, however,
several of the leading directors had shifted toward an international
stance, sometimes called "Mid-Atlantic" cinema—midway, as
it
were, between London and Hollywood. David Lean and Carol
Reed both excelled in Hollywood productions mingling British
and American personnel. Two of Lean's spectacle films dealing
with war and empire won Academy Awards for both best picture
and director. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Lawrence
of Arabia {}9b2).
The ''Angry'' Generation
A new group of young filmmakers emerged in the 1950s seeking
to restore the representation of everyday social
life to the British
cinema. Several got their start as critics (as was the case also in
France) for a short-lived but influential film journal. Sequence,
published by the Oxford University Film Society from 1946 to
1952. Others began as nonfiction filmmakers, participants in the
Free Cinema Movement of the mid-1950s that emphasized docu-
menting working-class
life. Chiefly they lacked a defining promo-
tional label, like the French nouvelle vague; by default thev were
associated with the "Angry Young Men" playwrights and novelists
whose works they frequently adapted for the screen.
TONY RICHARDSON. A key figure in their transition to fea-
ture filmmaking was Tony Richardson (1928-1991
), a stage
director who formed a production company to direct Look Back
in Anger (1959) and The Entertainer {^9b0) from plavs by John
Osborne. His greatest success with adapting British literature,
however, came not with a contemporary work but an eighteenth-
century classic by Henry Fielding: Tom /ones (1963), shot in color
with financing from United Artists, followed Lawrence of Arabia
in winning the Academy Award for best picture, and Richardson
succeeded Lean with the director's award. He, too, had become
"Mid-Atlantic."
An exemplary work of the short-lived British movement to
depict working-class life in fiction features was Saturday Night
and Sunday Morning ^^960), produced by Richardson and
directed by Karel Reisz (b. 1926).
It was adapted from an Alan
Sillitoe novel, and the author wrote the screenplay. Saturday Night
and Sunday Mornings bleak mise-en-scene, dominated by a
noisy factory floor, gritty workers' flats, and raucous pubs, links
it
to traditions of film realism such as Crierson's social documen-
taries, French poetic realism, and Italian neorealism. Sillitoe also
wrote the screenplay for The Loneliness of the Long Distance
Runner (1962), which was based on one of his short stories and
directed and produced by Richardson.
What was often most significant about Britain's early 1960s
social realist films was not their narratives or settings but their

exceptional performances; in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning
actor Albert Finney (b. 1936),
in his first important role, portrayed
the working-class figure Arthur Seaton, a rebellious, hard-drinking
lathe operator. The character has no illusions about social
improvement; he wants onlv to protect what he believes to be his
autonomy and self-empowerment. Finney creates him neither as
hero nor villain but as a man in conflict, who slowly gains aware-
ness of his responsibility toward the women in his
life. The film's
muted ending points him toward family
life, but offers no clear
promise either of autonomy or of responsibility in his future.
Finney gained international recognition for his title role in Tom
Jones; director Reisz followed Richardson into co-production
work. By 1963 the impulse to make socially conscious films about
contemporary British
life had largely waned.
EASTERN EUROPEAN
AND SOVIET FILM
The emergence of Eastern European filmmaking on the interna-
tional film scene during the 1960s marks a different kind of case
study, one that vividly illustrates a premise of this book's approach
to history: present-day change inevitably alters our understanding
of the past. A generation after the 1960s film renaissance, the
socialist regimes of Eastern Europe suddenly disintegrated, their
ideologies repudiated by their own peoples. The startling changes
of the 1990s, transforming sovereignties and boundaries, could
not but cast history, and film history,
in a new light.
The post-World War
II nations of Eastern Europe— here we will
be considering Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and
443

who will have a stake in the history of
filmmaking in the former Communist
regimes of Eastern Europe? In many of the
countries themselves, national identities
and political boundaries have swiftly
been reshaped since the collapse of
Soviet hegemony. With nations such as
East Germany, Yugoslavia, and
Czechoslovakia no longer existing in the
form they did from the end of World War
11 to 1989,
it remains to be seen whether
the films they produced will hold value
for the cultural heritage and historical
memories of new societies.
Among Eastern European countries,
however, one that has strong grounds for
maintaining a vital link to
its recent film
history
is Poland. With Andzrej Wajda as
a world-renowned figure, Poland's film
culture can draw on four decades of a
frequently reflexive and critical filmmak-
ing practice with ties to reform move-
ments in the wider society. Polish critics
and historians have begun taking a fresh
look at films from the Communist period
to see whether changed historical circum-
stances have produced new ways to
interpret and appreciate those works. One
film
little known outside Poland that has
been praised
is Rekopis znaleziony w
Saragossie (The Saragassa Manuscript,
1965), directed by Wojciech Has (b.
1925), a narrative of fantasy adventures
set in the eighteenth century.
Figures from Poland's first postwar gen-
eration of filmmakers whose works merit
renewed attention include Jerzy Kawaler-
owicz (b. 1922) and Andrzej Munk
(1921-1961). Kawalerowicz gained inter-
national recognition second only to
Wajda among Polish directors, winning
prizes at Venice for Pociag [Night Train,
1959), at Cannes for Matka Joanna od
Anioiow (Mother Joan of the Angels,
1961
), and at Berlin for Sm/erc Prezydenta
(Death of a President, 1977). Night Train
and Mother Joan of the Angels are social
parables set in enclosed spaces (a train
car and a convent) that were deliberately
vague as to place and time. Death of a
President is a historical film based on the
assassination of Poland's president in
1922; Polish audiences regarded
it as a
political parable for their own time. Munk
was a prolific filmmaker in the 1950s who
died in an automobile accident while
making Pasazerka (The Passenger), a film
concerning World War
I! death camps;
it
was completed by others and released in
1963.
The early works of Krzysztof Zanussi
(b. 1939), a key figure of Poland's next
generation, also deserve reconsideration.
Zanussi's first feature, Struktura krysztafu
(The Structure of Crystals, 1969) was
named best film of the year by Poland's
critics; like much of his later work,
it
posed issues of science, philosophy, and
morality through intellectual debates
between characters. Other important
films with similar themes included Barwy
ochronne (Camouflage, 1976) and
Constans (The Constant Factor, 1980).
Like Wajda, Zanussi worked frequently
outside Poland in the 1980s, making films
in West Germany with funding from
German state television.
Poland— fell under Soviet influence, and their film industries
became part of the state apparatus. Governments decided who
would make films and what kinds of films they would make; gov-
ernments promoted some films and banned or censored others.
What actually constitutes film history becomes a more pressing
question for these regimes than
in almost any other case.
Is there
a basic narrative of national film history, of creativity and recep-
tion? Only
if
it can include some account of the films made but
shelved and never seen except by censors. How does this version
compare to the narrative of international recognition, based on
those films sent to festivals and overseas exhibition? And how will
either of these versions relate to the histories that
still remain to
be written, of the "national" cinemas in "nations" that proved to
be makeshift and temporary, which nevertheless produced many
long-known works that need to be freshly appraised and long-
suppressed works that need to be discovered and circulated. An
example of the latter, among many, are the films of the Czech
woman director Vera Chytilova (b. 1929), for many years unavail-
able either at home or abroad.
More obviously than elsewhere. Eastern European films are
linked to politics. Though each country had
its own internal
dynamics, the early 1960s (following the near-nuclear confronta-
tion between the United States and the Soviet Union during the
1962 Cuban missile crisis) became in general a period of new cul

Shifting from socialist
realism's heroic themes to small
incidents of everyday life, Miloi

1965) gained
recognition for the Czechoslovak
"New Wave"; Vladimir Pucholt

tural initiatives. Western Europe and the United States discovered
Eastern European cinema; from 1966 to 1969 fully half the titles
nominated for best foreign-language film at the Hollywood
Academy Awards came from Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R. The
most dramatic expression of new filmmaking energies came in
Czechoslovakia, where the film movement that flowered between
1963 and 1968 earned the name, as in France and Japan, "New
Wave." The effort of Czech films to question and revise social val-
ues seemed to presage and herald the political movement of 1968
known as "Prague Spring," when reformers attempted to replace a
dictatorial regime with a new form of "socialist democracy." This
attempt at peaceful political transformation within a Communist
country was countered by Soviet bloc military intervention in
August 1968, and both the Prague Spring and the Czech New
Wave were crushed.
Czechoslovakia
The first signs of the Czech New Wave came in the early films of
Milos Forman (b. 1932). Forman had studied scriptwriting rather
than directing at the state film school, and thereby managed to
escape being inculcated, as most other postwar Czech directors
had been,
in the official aesthetic of Soviet-style "socialist real-
ism." His third film, Lasky jedne plavovlasky (Loves of a Blonde,
1965) won a prize at Venice and gave the New Wave interna-
tional recognition. Instead of socialist realism's heroic themes,
Forman's films focused on small incidents in everyday
life; Loves
of a Blonde concerns the romantic yearnings of a young woman
in a provincial town who works at a shoe factory.
THE firemen's BALL.
Forman's most ambitious New Wave
film was
tio'ri, ma panenko! [The Firemen's Ball, 1967), another
work of small incidents that in this case build into a tragicomedy
of social disintegration, incompetence, and corruption, and shape
a devastating allegorical critique of the socialist system. While fire
officials ogle the women chosen for a beauty contest, a man's
house burns and all the raffle prizes are stolen. In sorting out the
practical and moral issues, someone asks (in the dubbed English-
language version), "What about those people who bought tickets
and didn't steal anything?" The answer comes: "They could have.
There was no one stopping them.
It's their own fault." The
Firemen's Ball, significantly, was an international co-production
between Barrandov Studios in Prague and an Italian company.
Forman was in France preparing another international project
when Soviet bloc troops invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968. He

States, where he won the best director Academy Award for One
Flew over the Cuckoo's Nesf (1975) and made popular works
such as Hair (1979), Ragtime (1981
), and Amadeus (1984). He
also became codirector of the Film Division at Columbia
University in New York.
CLOSELY WATCHED TR A /NS. The Czech New Wave's
emblematic film was Ostfe sledovane vlaky (Closely Watched
Trains, 1966), directed by Jifi Menzel
(b. 1938). Like The
Firemen's Ball
it linked tragicomedy and social critique in the
form of satire, but
it was set during World War
11, and the Nazi
occupiers of Czechoslovakia were safer targets than contempo-
rary bureaucrats. The film's break with socialist conventions,
however, came in
its treatment of sexuality. As with Forman's
films, comic yet profound sexual longings are mingled with the
struggle for freedom; here the heroic sacrifice of a young train dis-
patcher emerges unexpectedly yet seamlessly from his
development as a man. Closely Watched Trains won the 1967
Hollywood Academy Award for best foreign language film.
It was
banned in Czechoslovakia after the 1968 invasion; repudiating his
earlier work, including Closely Watched Trains, Menzel contin-
ued his career in Czechoslovakia.
Yugoslavia
Sexuality was also central to the cinematic approach of Dusan
Makavejev (b. 1932), a Serb who was the first filmmaker to
gain international prominence from Yugoslavia, a country formed
after World War
I that broke up into separate republics in the
early 1990s. In his debut feature film, Covek nije tica (Man Is Not
a Bird, 1966), he shot his performers in the French New Wave
manner, with a hand-held camera alongside passersby in the
street. The film's metaphors of hypnosis, and of man's incapacity
to fly like a bird, hint at the pathos of working-class lives in a
region of mines and factories. After making several more innovat-
ing features on similar themes, Makavejev shifted to a surreal style
treating sexuality and society more generally, and left Yugoslavia
for international production.
Meanwhile,
in 1967 director Aleksandar Petrovic (b. 1929)
made what was hailed as the most important work in Yugoslav
film history, Skupljaci perja
(I Even Met Happy Gypsies), a prize
winner at the Cannes film festival. Also utilizing a hand-held
camera style, the film focused on the lives of Yugoslavia's Gypsy
people, with the soundtrack in Gypsy dialect.
Its title was
poignant and ironic,
like the song lyric from which
it was drawn.

Hungary
Among the most unusual feature film styles originating in Eastern
Europe during the 1960s was that of Hungarian director Miklos
Jancso (b. 1921). His films were not narratives in the conventional
sense, even though many depicted events in Hungarian history
familiar, at least, to domestic audiences. There was
little charac-
terization, performance, or even spoken dialogue, as opposed to
songs or declaimed words. The works were akin to folk ballets,
with choreographed crowd movement, songs, dances, and pat-
terned motion,
all photographed by a constantly moving camera
in lengthy takes. His eighty-four-minute film Meg ker a nep (Red
Psalm, 1972) consists of only twenty-seven shots. Songs, poems,
and declamations, meanwhile, address basic philosophical issues
of Marxism, socialism, and popular struggle. Jancso won the
award for best director at Cannes for Red Psalm.
Other important Hungarian filmmakers included Marta
Meszaros (b. 1931
) and istvan Szabo (b. 1938). Meszaros made
her first feature, Eltavozott nap [The Girl), in 1968 and was one of
the few women filmmakers whose works circulated internationally
during the 1970s. Relationships between women and the social
conditions of women in Hungary formed the themes of a number
of her works, such as Orokbefogadas (Adoption, 1975), concern-
ing an older and a younger woman who are both involved with
the same man. Szabo's characteristic subjects were recent history
and the relationship between the present and the past, as in

of an old house in Budapest recount their dreams and memories,

the life of German actor Gustav GriJndgens (1899-1963), who
played the criminal leader Schraenker in Fritz Lang's A4 and went
on to become a prominent performer-director in the Nazi era.
Soviet Union
If an international perspective on a nation's films inevitably
is
shaped by works that circulate across borders, the Soviet Union
marks a special case. For several decades after 1945 the Soviets
sent abroad only a few films, generally adaptations from classic
Russian writers like Tolstoy or Chekhov, or works stressing what
were called "universal human themes" such as the injustice and
futility of war; an example of the latter was Letyat zhuravli (The
Cranes Are Flying, 1957), a World War
II film directed by Mikhail
Kalatozov (1903-1973), which won the award for best film at
Cannes. These rather bland or safe films did not prepare specta-
tors outside the Soviet Union for the stylistic daring of several
Soviet filmmakers whose works began to circulate internationally
in the mid-1960s and who were immediately hailed as masters of
the medium, even as they experienced obstruction and punish-
ment at home.
SERCEl PARADZHANOV. One of the most Striking Stylistic
achievements in world cinema since World War
II was Teni zaby-
tykh predkov (Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, also known as
Wild Horses of Fire, 1964), directed by Sergei Paradzhanov

studio in Kiev, the Ukraine. Set in an earlier century in the
Carpathian region, the film
is rich
in folkloric elements, costumes,
rituals, and songs. As in Jancso's works, however, narrative hardly
matters, especially since the frequent chants and song lyrics go
untranslated
in subtitled versions. The film
is a visual tour de
force, using symbolic colors and nonrealistic tinting, slow motion,
character viewpoint shots, soundtrack manipulation, multiple
exposure, and a constantly moving hand-held camera that at
times makes rapid full-circle pans,
in part to emphasize themes of
circularity.
A tribute both to the potentialities of cinema and to ethnic tra-
ditions within the Soviet Union, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors
was derided
in
its home country and Paradzhanov's career ham-
pered by authorities. He was finally allowed to make another film,
Sayat nova (The Color of Pomegranates, completed
in 1969), with
similar themes and visual style, but
it was shelved and reedited
by others before
its release in 1972. In 1974 Paradzhanov was
arrested and sentenced to prison on a variety of charges; his per-
secution clearly was related to his championing of ethnic and
national values against the policy of the Soviet government.
International as well as domestic protests gained his release in
1977.
ANDREI TARKOVSKY. The Russian filmmaker Andrei
Tarkovsky (1932-1986) experienced similar though less severe dif-
ficulties over his mystical, highly symbolic style of filmmaking,
and before his early death he had
left the Soviet Union to work
abroad. His historical epic Andrei Rublev (1966), based on the life
of a monk and painter of holy icons who lived in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, was shelved by authorities, who
demanded that scenes depicting nudity and what they regarded
as excessive violence be cut. Requests from foreign festivals won
the film an unofficial screening at Cannes in 1969, where
it won
the international critics' prize, and the circulation of a single print
finally achieved release of the uncut version.
Tarkovsky's Solaris (1971
), a nearly three-hour epic of space
exploration, would make a good (though lengthy) double
feature with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Like most of
Tarkovsky's work, Solaris
is concerned with naturt, childhood,
and history, with dreams, memory, and imagination. "We don't
want other worlds," says one character (in English-language
subtitles), "we want a mirror."
Poland
Andrzej Wajda, the first postwar Eastern European director to gain
international fame in the 1950s (see Chapter 15), returned to that
era as a subject in Cziowiek z marmuru {Man of Marble, 1976). A
student of film directing in her early twenties, portrayed by Polish
actress Krystyna Janda (b. 1952) in her first film role, wants to
make her diploma film on a worker-hero of the early 1950s. She
screens black-and-white footage from the archives (some actuality
material, some artfully re-created, including a 1950s title card
with "A. Wajda" as assistant director) while tracking down figures
from the past. They,
in turn, relate their stories in the Citizen Kane
manner,
in flashback sequences (in color in Man of Marble). The
young filmmaker discovers that the man she investigates, while
originally a "hero" through manipulation and publicity, became
an authentic hero through adversity. Meanwhile, school officials
shelve her uncompleted film. Man of Marble was not shelved, but
it did elicit strong displeasure from the government. Foregoing
showy stylistics, the film synthesized an era of Eastern European
history and filmmaking.
Man of Marble marked what a Polish critic called Wajda's
"second debut"; he went on to make several films dealing with
contemporary Polish political
life, including Bez znieczulenia
(Without Anesthesia, 1978) and Cziowiek z zelaza (Man of Iron,
1981 ), concerning the Gdansk shipyard strike of 1980 and the

EUROPEAN CINEMA
WITHOUT BORDERS
By the late 1960s, the unification of western Europe seemed a
possibility in the realm of cinema, though not yet in the institu-
tions of government. Film had become a medium surpassing
national borders, with international productions almost the rule
rather than the exception.
Blow- Up
The era's famous example, highlighting the trend, was
Michelangelo Antonioni's first film in English, 6/ow-L/p (1966).
The film involved an Italian producer, director, and screenplay;
British location, cast, and crew; and a Hollywood distributor,
M-G-M. But
it was the film's themes, rather than
its behind-the-
scenes components, that made
it seem a transformative work for
contemporary culture as well as for cinema.
Its protagonist
is a fashion photographer who, at the film's
beginning, has just taken photographs inside a men's shelter for a
book oriented toward social realism,
in the manner of British early
1960s working-class films. When he begins to process some last
shots taken
in a park, he discovers through repeated enlargements
what he thinks
is a murder. He wanders through London, taking
in a rock concert and a marijuana party, as questions of what is
real, and how to act, become more and more muddled. At the
end, he encounters a mime troupe, two of whom are panto-
miming a tennis game without a ball. A player motions the
photographer to fetch the imaginary ball. He gestures picking
it
up and throwing
it, and then, with the camera aimed on his face,
the soundtrack conveys the sound of a ball bouncing and striking
a racquet.
If in earlier films, such as L'Avventura, Antonioni was
concerned with vision and perception, here he turns toward the
multiplication and manipulation of images. The photographer has
abandoned realism for a postmodern sensibility. Blow-Up won
the award for best film at the Cannes film festival.
Luis Bumel
The Spanish director Luis Bunuel, after nearly two decades in
Mexico, returned to Europe in the mid-1960s to make a
last
group of films in combinations of French,
Italian, and Spanish
co-production. These works, of which Le Charme discret de la
bourgeoisie {The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, 1972)
is per-
haps the best known, have been grist for political, psychoanalytic,
and other forms of analysis yet resist being pinned down.
The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is both crashingly obvi-
ous and cunningly elusive. Three men and three women are
interrupted on numerous occasions as they prepare to dine; some
incidents turn out to be dreams (only the men are dreamers), and
one dream
is even dreamt within another; the men are drug
smugglers who are protected because one
is an ambassador from
a Latin American dictatorship; periodically the six are shown
walking confusedly on a country road. To label the film "surreal"
would be to go against the grain of its elusiveness, yet one might
say that Bunuel's brand of surrealism remained fresh over nearly
half a century of filmmaking. Like much of his work, the film
is at
once absurd, cruel, pointed, and, above all, funny.
Alain Tanner
Filmmaking in Switzerland gained recognition
in the 1970s
through the works of director Alain Tanner (b. 1929), who utilized
French as well as Swiss production financing, and collaborated
frequently on screenplays with British novelist and art critic John
Berger. In his best-known film, Jonas qui aura 25 ans en I'an 2000
{Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000, 1976), Tanner chroni-
cled four men and four women from the "post-1968" generation
coming together to form a loose collective, with education for the
future, such as for the newly born Jonah, a chief concern. The filn^
proclaims that "politics
is finished"— at least one kind of 1960s
ideological struggle— but
it proposes stylistically what might be
called a politics of the imagination. Through black-and-white
footage inserted among the color narrative, characters' fantasies.

lives.
Una Wertmtiller
Along vi'ith
its preoccupation with the legacy of neorealism (see
Chapter 13), Italian cinema also shifted toward internationalism
during the 1970s. A prominent figure in this trend was Lina
Wertmuller (b. 1928), whose films of the 1970s gained her an
international audience behind only Fellini and De Sica among
postwar Italian directors. They also brought popularity to her fre-
quent lead performer, actor Giancarlo Giannini (b. 1942).
Works such as Travolti da un insolito destino neli'azzurro mare
d'agosto ("Swept Away by a Strange Destiny on an Azure August
Sea," known as Swept Away, 1974) and Pasqualino settebellezze
("Pasqualino Seven Beauties," known as Seven Beauties, 1976),
took on significant political and human themes (in Sei'en
Beauties, the Nazi death camps), though in a style featuring gross
sexuality and grotesque caricatures. These successes led to a
multipicture contract with a Hollywood studio that was canceled
after her first English-language film. The End of the World in Our
Usual Bed in a Night Full of Rain (1978), failed with critics and at
the box office.
Bernardo Bertolucci
The young Italian Bernardo Bertolucci (b. 19401, who had
become a prominent director while still
in his early twenties,
moved into the international sphere in the 1970s with Ultimo
tango a Parigi {Last Tango In Paris, 1972
1, an Italian-French co-
production starring American actor Marion Brando. The film was
promoted as the most sexually explicit mainstream work yet to be
released, though for candor
it could not compete w ith the
hard-core pornographic films just then appearing in theaters.
Nevertheless,
its notoriety made
it a box office success, and
Bertolucci secured the funds to make an epic on Italian history,
Novecento 0900, 1976).
Originally running over five hours, on
its release 7900 was
exhibited in two parts or cut by more than an hour in overseas
distribution; some years later the full-length version again circu-
lated. With Italian, French, and German production financing,
Bertolucci used an international cast that included American per-
formers Robert De Niro, Burt Lancaster (b. 1913), and Sterling
Hayden (1916-1986); Gerard Depardieu (b. 1948) and
Dominique Sanda (b. 1948) from France; Canadian Donald
Sutherland (b. 1934); and, from
ltal>, the pre-World War
I diva
Francesca Bertini. Coming from different generations and modes
of production, the performers had difficulty meshing their accus-
tomed acting styles, and like many star-laden international
productions the film seemed to lose the focus of its narrative, a
452

sweeping effort to portray Italian society from 1900 to the end of
World War
II. International co-productions provided filmmakers
financing and opportunities, but there were often drawbacks
among the gains.
Padre Padrone
Were there alternatives? For financing, one source of support was
government entities, such as Europe's state-run television net-
works. For subjects, a shift from internationalism led to the
internal periphery, to local settings so remote that even "nation"
(from the micro-perspective) might be a questionable category.
Such a trajectory was taken by Padre padrone ("My Father, My
Master," but known as Padre Padrone, ]977), directed by Paolo
and Vittorio Taviani, with financing from the Italian state televi-
sion, RAI (Radiotelevisione Italiana). The film dramatized an
autobiography by a thirty-five-year-old linguistics scholar, Gavino
Ledda, who had been an illiterate shepherd on the Italian island
of Sardinia until he joined the army at age eighteen, where he
learned to read and write, and to speak Italian instead of dialect.
Besides
its unusual subject. Padre Padrone was notable for its use
of sound to render inner consciousness, not only of individuals
but also of groups in a Babel of voices and even of animals.
It
won both the best film award and the international critics' prize at
Cannes.

The Sf^irit of the Beehive
Another \ersion of the peripheral or local were cinemas in coun-
tries outside Europe's center, for political or other reasons. An
example
is Spain, ruled by the dictatorship of General Francisco
Franco from the late 1930s, the end of Spain's Civil War, until his
death in 1975. Without international stars or financing, an out-
standing Spanish film of the era, El espi'ritu de la colmena (The
Spirit of the Beehive. 1973>, directed bv Victor Erice <b. 1940i,
focused on a locality impinged on b\ the \\ ider world,
in the form
of cinema.
Constrained bv censorship, the film dealt with historical and
social issues through visual and aural metaphors, the darkness
and silence of a rural house without electricity around 1940.
Its
thematic metaphor was the 1931
horror classic Frankenstein,
shown in a village hall. Six-year-old Ana iportraved by child per-

Germany had not been able to revive
its strong cinematic her-
itage. Italy had produced neorealism, Fellini, Antonioni, and a
vigorous group of successors. Japan had brought forth (or back)
Mizoguchi, Ozu, Kurosawa, and the New Wave. Germany's cine-
matic heritage, one might say, had emigrated to Hollywood,
\\ here Lang, Wilder, and Sirk were major figures among dozens
of other former German film personnel. In the 1950s West
Germany fostered a genre of Heimat (homeland) films centering
on sentimental domestic themes. Few West German films circu-
lated abroad, and West Germany's film theaters were dominated
by foreign films.
Young German Film
At a 1962 film festi\al a group of West German filmmakers, orga-
nized under the name Young German Film, agitated for state
support of cinema. B\ 1965 an agency had been set up to gram
production loans, and a new generation of West German film-
makers began to make feature films. Significant debuts were
made by directors such as Volker Schlondorff (b. 1939) with Der
junge Torless
( Young Torless, 19651, Alexander Kluge (b. 1932)
with Abschied von gestern diteralK
'Farewell to Yesterday,
" but
released in English as Yesterday Girl, 1966), and Werner Herzog
(b. 1942i with Lebenszeichen iSigns of Life, 1967), among others.
Additional funding came from other government agencies, and in
the 1970s, as elsewhere in Europe, state-operated West German
television added support for feature filmmaking. Young German
Film uas transformed into New German Cinema, and began to
find fame and attract audiences everywhere— except in Germany.
New German Cinema presents the paradox of a filmmaking prac-
tice financed in
its home countr\
that uas principalis discussed
and appreciated abroad— a cinema that was national in produc-
tion and international
in reception. A few filmmakers and
moxements will serve to exemplifx the issues of West German

avant-garde).

emotion.
NEW GERMAN CINEMA
Among European countries in the 1970s, nowhere was the com-
plex dialogue between national cinema and internationalism
more problematic than in Germany—that
is, in West Germany,
known as the Federal Republic of Germanv. This countrv had
been formed from the occupation zones of Britain

Rainer Werner Fassbinder
Perhaps the most remarkable phenomenon of New German
Cinema was the brief but prolific career of Rainer Werner
Fassbinder (1946-1982), who died, apparentK from a drug over-
dose, at age thirty-six. Few other directors in cinema historx ha\e
matched his productivity: in a thirteen-\ear career, from 1969 to
1981, Fassbinder directed nearly forty films for theaters and televi-
sion, counting as only one a miniseries, Berlin Alexanderplatz
(1979-80), that ran fifteen and a half hours in fourteen parts. In
the early years, working with a group of performers u ith whom
he also wrote and directed plavs, Fassbinder made films quickly
and cheapiv, shooting a feature often in less than ten da\s. Yet
even the roughest of these works
is not u ithout compelling inter-
est: Fassbinder and his "anti-theater" companv aimed to
transgress taboos and puncture social and ideological mytholo-
gies.
It
is difficult to single out anv one film as the most
455

representative, the likeliest to endure. "It's the entirety of the oeu-
vre [an artist's complete works) that must say something special
about the time in which
it was made," Fassbinder said, "otherwise
it's worthless."^
What was special about Fassbinder's work might be called, too
grandly, his treatment of the political economy of human desire.
Many of his films dealt with sexuality, and among his controver-
sial works were Die bitteren Tranen der Petra von Kant [The Bitter
Tears of Petra von Kant, 1972), concerning lesbian relations, and
Faustrecht der Freiheit (literally "Fist-Right of Freedom," but
released in English as Fox and His Friends, 1974), about homosex-
ual men. But Fassbinder insisted that his central focus was less on
sexual behavior than on the power relations among people sexu-
ally involved with one another, including elements such as social
class, age, ethnicity, and beauty. Another of his significant films
on this theme was Angst essen Seele auf(Fear Eats the Soul, also
known as AH: Fear Eats the Soul, 1973), which explores the
dynamics of a marriage between a Moroccan working man and a
German woman twenty years his senior.
Fassbinder made a substantial international box office success
for the first time with Die Ehe der Maria Braun (The Marriage of
Maria Braun, 1978), which also brought acclaim to actress Hanna
Schygulla (b. 1943), an early coworker of Fassbinder's who had
appeared in nearly half his films. Set between the war years and
the mid-1950s. The Marriage of Maria Braun marked a turn
toward history for the director: three of his last four features

Marleen (1980), Lola (1981
), and Die Sehnsucht der Veronika
Voss ("The Longing of Veronika Voss," released in English as

Europe after the Allies were victorious in
World War
11. Two fascist governments
that had been founded in the 1930s, but
that did not participate militarily in the
war, managed to last fully another genera-
tion— in Spain, where Francisco Franco
held power from 1936 until his death
in
1975, and in Portugal, where the regime
established by Antonio de Oliveira
Salazar in the early 1930s continued until
1974, four years after Salazar's death.
Unlike Italy and even Nazi Germany in
the 1930s, Spain and Portugal
in the first
postwar years pursued film policies cen-
tering primarily on censorship and
propaganda.
In the early 1960s, however, new cur-
rents emerged in the film cultures of both
countries. Seeking to project an image of
liberalization to strengthen
its links to the
European community, Spain fostered a
"New Spanish Cinema" to correspond
with other new waves of the era. The first
Spanish filmmaker of this generation to
gain international recognition was Carlos
Saura (b. 1932) with La caza (The Hunt,
1966), a film that utilized a hunting party
as an allegory to explore the legacy of
Spain's Civil War. Beginning the following
year with Peppermint frappe, most of
Saura's films over the next decade fea-
tured American actress Geraldine Chaplin
(b. 1944), daughter of Charles Chaplin.
His most notable work of the period was
Crfa Cuervos (literally "Raise Ravens,"
released in English as Cria!,
1976), an
intense family drama with political over-
tones.

important filmmaker, Manoel de Oliveira
(b. 1908), who began directing in the
1930s but had not been permitted to
make a film between 1942 and 1956.
Among his works over the next two
decades that played a leading role in the
development of Portuguese cinema were
O acfo da primavera (Spring Mystery
Play, 1963), combining documentary and
fiction based on traditional passion plays;
O passado e o presente
( The Past and the
Present, 1971), a comedy; Amor de
perdiqao (Doomed Love, 1978), and
Francisca (1981), films that link stylized
decor with narratives of frustrated pas-
sion.
Greece had a shorter experience of
dictatorship in the postwar period when a
military junta seized power and ruled the
country from 1967 to 1974. The political
turmoil leading up to the coup was the
subject of one of the most highly praised
political films of the postwar era, Z
(1969), an Algerian-French co-production
directed by Constantin Costa-Gavras (b.
1933), a Greek-born filmmaker who
became a French citizen and worked in
France and the United States. Despite the
dictatorship, Greece's most significant
filmmaker, Theo Angelopoulos (b. 1935)
began his career in the junta years with
Anaparastassi (Reconstruction, 1970), a
murder mystery that displayed his charac-
teristic style, combining long takes and
tracking shots. Two of Angelopoulos's
films have won the top prize at the
Venice Film Festival, O Megalexandros
(Alexander the Great, 1980) and Topio
stin Omichli (Landscape in the Mist,
1988).

of social and psychological struggles in the postwar period. An
admirer of Hollywood's family melodramas, particularly the work
of the German emigre Douglas Sirk, Fassbinder revived the genre
and infused
it with new political and historical resonance.
Germany in Autumn
One of the unique projects of New German Cinema— perhaps
also in cinema history— was the collective film Deutschland im
Herbst (Germany in Autumn, 1978). There had been numerous
films with multiple directors, even some addressing contemporary
political issues, but few
if any similar works directly responded to
an immediate crisis through such an extensive collaborative
endeavor. Nine directors were credited on the film, including
Fassbinder, Kluge, and Schlondorff. The background was a series

Die Ehe der Maria Braun

1978) was the first of several

post-1945 Germany through the
lives of women; Hanna Schygulla
played the title role.
of events in
fall 1977 involving the kidnapping of an industnaiist,
later found murdered; the hijacking of a passenger jet to Somalia,
where German police stormed the plane and rescued hostages;
and the suicides, or murders, of three urban guerrillas in a prison.
These events threw the Federal Republic into crisis, which the film
sought both to depict and to contest through a complex mix of
documentation, historical analogy, and fictional treatments.
It
would be asking too much to find such a film fully coherent, but
its overall tone was to warn against the state's exercise of authori-
tarian power. Among its most powerful segments
is Fassbinder's,
an intensely autobiographical sequence in which his relations
with his lover and his mother become enmeshed
in political dis-
putes and paranoia.
Women Filmmakers
Individual women directors were working in a number of coun-
tries during the 1970s, but West Germany was among the few
where a women's film practice took root as part of (sometimes in
conflict with) the decade's feminist movement. A key figure was
Helke Sander (b. 1937), who was also editor for some years of
Frauen und Film (Women and Film), the only regularly published
feminist film journal
in Europe. Sander's first feature was Die all-
seitig reduzierte Personlichkelt—Redupers
( The All Round
Reduced Personality—Redupers, 1977), a diary film combining
fiction and documentary, in which the writer-director also played
the leading role as a free-lance photographer in Berlin. The film
is
suffused not only with the struggles of women artists and activists
to gain serious attention for their perspectives but also with an
acute consciousness of a city and a culture splintered by the
omnipresent Berlin Wall (erected by East Germany in 1961, the
wall was torn down
in 1989).
GERMANY, PALE MOTHER. Perhaps the most important fic-
tion film by a West German woman filmmaker was Deutschland,
bleiche Mutter (Germany, Pale Mother, 1979), directed by Helma
Sanders-Brahms (b. 1940).
Its title was taken from a 1933 poem
by Bertolt Brecht, written at the time of Hitler's rise to power, a
457

translation of which reads,
in part, "O Germany, pale mother/
How you
sit defiled / Among the peoples." The film shares traits
both with Redupers and Fassbinder's late historical works: the
narrative takes the form of a family melodrama covering the Nazi
period and the postwar years, while on the soundtrack a woman's
voice comments on events as
if they were scenes from her own
autobiography. Among
its other stylistic features
is a depiction of
Berlin after the war combining actuality footage along with new
material made to appear as
if
it were newsreel shots, part of the
film's approach to issues of representation and perception.

attract New German filmmakers as their movement matured.
Schlondorff's Die Blechtrommel {The Tin Drum, 1979) won the
Hollywood Academy Award for best foreign-language film—
a
landmark recognition for postwar West German cinema— as well
as the prize for best film at Cannes, and the director within a few
years was working mainly in the United States. Herzog had a brief
fling with Hollywood studio distribution with Nosferatu—
Phantom der Nacht {Nosferatu the Vampire, 1979), released
through Twentieth Century-Fox.
WIM WENDERS. The exemplary case of Hollywood's impact
on New German Cinema, however, was Wim Wenders (b. 1945).
In the 1970s Wenders made several films exploring relations
between German and American cultures, including Alice in den
Stadten (Alice in the Cities, 1973) and Der amerikanische Freund
{The American Friend, 1977). One character says to another in his
458

Im Laufder Zeit ("In the Course of Time," released in English as
Kings of the Road, 1976) that the Americans "have colonized our
subconscious."
Wenders went to Hollywood in the late 1970s at Francis Ford
Coppola's invitation to direct HammefM 1982), based on a novel
about the detective fiction writer Dashiell Hammett. After
Coppola, as executive producer, ordered major revisions, only
about one-third of the released film was Wenders's work.
Wenders remained
in the United States for much of the 1980s,
and works such as Paris, Texas (1984) suggested that he had
become, like Schlondorff and the British directors of the early
1960s, a "Mid-Atlantic" filmmaker. But he returned to Germany to
make Der Himmel iJber Bedin ("The Sky over Berlin," released
in
English as Wings of Desire, 1987), a strikingly imaginative film
in
black-and-white and color, for which he won the best director
prize at Cannes. In the sky over Berlin, angels hover unseen by
human adults (but not by children or the film's spectators) and
descend to mingle with people, hearing their inner thoughts.
Falling in love with a trapeze artist in a circus, an angel portrayed
by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz (b. 1941
) gives up his angelhood to
share the human condition—the director's symbolic return to
Europe from the sky over the mid-Atlantic.

was revolutionary in nnany ways. A rev-
olution occurred at the box office, as
new marketing techniques led to unprecedented financial returns
for the most successful films. A revolution took place simultane-
ously for movies as private entertainment: by 1990 more than
two-thirds of United States households had acquired video cas-
sette recorders, and many preferred to watch films on cassettes at
home;
in addition, cable television offered a variety of movie
channels and the opportunity to order recent films on a "pay-
per-view" basis. And a revolution was in the making in industrial
ownership, as Japanese and other foreign companies acquired
major Hollywood studios, and other movie companies merged
with publishing corporations,
in efforts to shape globally oriented
technology/information/entertainment conglomerates. Perhaps the
least revolutionary aspect of United States filmmaking in the
period was what appeared on screen.
FINANCIAL REVOLUTIONS
Box Office
We have already observed (in Chapter 20) how Hollywood came
out of its economic doldrums in the early 1970s through innova-
tive marketing strategies featuring wide simultaneous distribution
of important films, backed by national television advertising. Films
such as The Godfather and The fxorc/sf broke box office records,
but were soon surpassed by an even more striking phenomenon:
films that became marketing events in themselves, spinning off
tie-in products such as clothing and toys, and attracting young
persons to return and see them more than once. The path-
breaking work was yaws (1975), directed by Steven Spielberg,
whose monster shark became an instant artifact of commercial
folklore (greatly aided by John Williams's menacing music for the
film) and later the centerpiece of a motion picture studio theme
park. Jaws was the first film to go over $100 million in domestic
rentals (the distribution company's share of the box office), and
by 1993
it remained eighth on the all-time box office
list.
The implications oi Jaws and the mega-hits that followed were
far-reaching. Filmmakers began to shape more films for the young
spectators who consumed the toys and other tie-in products and
formed the repeat audience. Special effects became increasingly
important to please the same age group, as did films based on
familiar comic book characters, from Superman (1978) to Batman
(1989). Hit films generated sequels— not a new phenomenon,
though
it was novel to name them with Roman numerals (by 1993
Star Trek was up to VI, and other perennial favorites trailed at
V or IV). As movie theaters changed from single-auditorium
houses to "multiplex" layouts with up to a dozen or more screens,
a handful of blockbuster films dominated exhibition more than
ever before, each appearing simultaneously on anywhere from a
thousand to two thousand screens.
Home Video
Yet this form of concentration was countered by the revolution
in
the opposite direction, toward home video consumption of
460

movies. Video cassette recorders went through rapid technologi-
cal development beginning in the 1970s, and became almost a
standard appliance in the United States home. For many
it w^as
accompanied by the "camcorder" video camera, replacing 8mm
or Super-8mm celluloid film as the choice for home moviemak-
ing. But more commonly
it was used for viewing feature films on
cassettes rented or purchased at the video stores that sprouted up
in every town.
Initially producers charged a high price for individ-
ual copies because the principal buyers were video store owners,
but they soon discovered a phenomenon the industry called "sell-
through":
if cassette prices were lowered to compare with the cost
of a book,
it was possible to sell millions of copies to consumers
who wanted to keep a film
in their "video libraries." The Walt
Disney Co.'s estimated net earnings from video sales of its ani-
mated film Beauty and the Beast (1991
) were higher than the net
profits from theatrical box office returns of any film
in history.
In addition, a smaller but still substantial number of film fans
acquired laser disk players, which provided a sharper image than
video and faster scanning to specific scenes of films recorded on
disks. Special editions of films on disk often included extra mate-
rials such as footage that had been cut from release prints, trailers,
screen tests, or interviews, and these features also began to be
added to many video versions of films. Sales of video, laser disk,
pay-per-view, and cable television rights became major sources of
THE NEGLECTED
"GOLDEN AGE"
The changes wrought by the revolutionar/ developments in mar-
keting, distribution, technology, and finance beginning in the
mid-1970s drew attention away from an unusual period of
Hollywood filmmaking, one that coincides with the industry's
revival
in the early 1970s. Film critic Pauline Kael has suggested
that this era, rather than the more commonly designated decades
of the 1930s and 1940s, was Hollywood's authentic "Golden
Age."
It was surely a brief age, half a decade at most. Among the
cultural factors that may have shaped
it was a strong national
mood of self-questioning following the United States defeat in
Vietnam, further exacerbated by President Richard M. Nixon's
resignation
in the wake of the Watergate scandal. In addition, the
postwar baby boom generation, which had developed a taste for
serious popular filmmaking, was at the height of its youth-
audience influence.
Among the most significant films from this mini-"Golden Age"
were Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation and The Godfather
Part II (both 1974); Chinatown (1974), directed by Roman Polanski
(b. 1933); and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver 0976). A common
thread running through these and many of the era's other works
is
RECOVERY
revenue for the major studios and of critical importance for pro-
ducers of lower-budget films; often crowded out of theaters by the
blockbusters, such films could sometimes come close to earning
back their costs from sales of home video and cable television
rights.
The New Conglomerates
The video revolution fostered the notion that "synergy" could be
created between "hardware" and "software"—that technology,
information, and entertainment all could be more effectively uti-
lized through combined endeavor rather than standing alone.
Hollywood studios, which in the 1960s had become subsidiaries
of insurance companies and parking lot chains, now attracted the
interest of publishers and video equipment manufacturers. Major
developments at the end of the 1980s included acquisition of
Twentieth Century-Fox by the News Corp., an international pub-
lishing and broadcasting company based
in Australia; the merger
of Warner Communications, parent of Warner Bros., with Time,
Inc., the publishing firm, to form Time Warner; the purchase of
Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star by the Japanese manufacturer
Sony Corp., and of MCA-Universal by the Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., makers of video products. Although Hollywood
studios in earlier eras had owned record companies or radio sta-
tions that promoted, for example, movie theme songs, these new
conglomerations brought media and communications to unprece-
dented levels of interrelationship. Under the same corporate
umbrella subsidiaries could turn one product into many—
a
movie, a book, a soundtrack album; and newspapers and maga-
zines owned by the same corporation could review them
all.
a concern with the interweaving of personal and institutional
power; most proffer endings suffused with tragedy, pessimism, or
ironic ambiguity.
Francis Ford Copf^ola
After The Godfather, the biggest box office success to that point
in film history, Coppola wrote and directed The Conversation, a
work modeled on the European art film. Antonioni's Blow-Up
was a reference point for Coppola's film, which concerns a man
who works with sound rather than images: an eavesdropping
expert, he records a conversation which, as he reconstructs
it
from many hidden microphones, seems to him to involve plotting
a murder. A film of considerable visual as well as aural subtlety.
The Conversation was a box office flop but has grown
in stature
as a work of cinematic art.
In the same year as The Conversation, Coppola directed one of
the first important sequels of the era. The Godfather Part
II. Like
many sequels
it was less successful financially than the original,
but
its admirers found
it a deeper, darker, more powerful film.
It
carried the Godfather saga both backward and forward in time,
interspersing scenes of the youth and early manhood of Vito
Corleone (Marlon Brando's Godfather figure, now portrayed by
Robert De Niro) with the narrative of his son and successor,
Michael (again, Al Pacino). This film, more sharply than the first,
emphasizes organized crime as a business enterprise, deeply
enmeshed in political manipulation. "We're both part of the same
hypocrisy," Michael tells a United States senator. The work
develops a tragic motif by depicting a profound contradiction in
Michael's inherited ideology of the family, imposing on him a
-467

code of behavior that inexorably destroys his family
life. After The
Godfather revitalized the gangster genre, Part II challenged
it in
the spirit of genre revision.
Roman Polanski
Polanski's Chinatown, from a screenplay by Robert Towne (b.
1936), wais another revisionist work. The Polish director had
become one of the earliest exiles from Eastern European cinema
(see Chapter 21
) after his first feature film, Noz w Wodzic {Knife
in the Water, 1962), a prizewinner at Venice, was attacked by the
Polish government. Working in Europe and the United States,
Polanski made several quirky horror films, jarring but genial, and
brought this macabre style to what seems at first glance a genre
detective film. But Chinatown's private eye,
J.
J. Cittes, portrayed
by Jack Nicholson,
is beyond his depth
in a world of political and
sexual power and corruption. Set in the 1930s, the film's narrative
frame (based on historical events) concerns behind-the-scenes
maneuvering to assure sufficient water supplies for Southern
California's development. The film made "Chinatown" a short-
hand metaphor for hidden links between economic power and
corrupt politics.
Martin Scorsese
Scorsese's Taxi Driver— with a screenplay by Paul Schrader (b.
1946)— was perhaps the most disturbing work among this group.
A Marine Corps veteran, Travis Bickle (portrayed by Robert De
Niro), drives a New York taxi and speaks with growing distur-
bance over what he sees as the city's filth and human scum. His

For a brief moment in Hollywood's short
"Golden Age" of the mid-1970s
it
appeared that director John Cassavetes
(1929-19891 had made
it, on his own
terms, into the mainstream. His film A
Woman Under the Influence (1974),
which he had not only produced but also
managed to distribute through his own
independent company, had won unusual
critical acclaim: in an era when American
commercial cinema seemed unable to
create significant roles for women, here
was a work with a full, intense, emo-
tional, anguishing portrait of a woman
from a working-class family. For her per-
formance as Mabel Longhetti, Cena
Rowlands (b. 1934i, the director's wife,
was nominated for an Academy Award as
best actress and Cassavetes won nomina-
tion as best director— remarkable
recognition for a film that was not
released by a major studio.
Cassavetes's first film. Shadows (1959),
began as an exercise for an improvisa-
tional acting workshop he was teaching
and helped to launch the movement of
independent non-HolKAvood filmmaking
of the 1960s (see Chapter 23). Critic and
filmmaker Jonas Mekas contrasted the
first version of Shadows with Citizen
Kane. Orson VVelles's film was an attempt
at destroving life and creating art, Mekas
said, while Cassavetes's work made an
attempt at catching (and retaining)
life.
"Shadows breaks with official staged cin-
ema, with made-up faces, with written
scripts, with plot continuities," Mekas
wrote. "Even
its inexperience in editing,
sound, and camera work becomes a part
of its style." Though Mekas became angry
with Cassavetes for producing a longer
and more conventional version of
Shadows, his words aptiv describe all of
Cassavetes's best work: improvisational,
unorganized, visceral, with a roughness
(as Mekas wrote) that only life has,
it
resembled few other films in either
independent or Hollywood cinema.
Shadows gave Cassavetes opportunities
to direct Hollywood films, but he was
uncomfortable and generally unsuccess-
ful when working under studio auspices.
Originally an actor, he emulated the tac-
tics of Orson VVelles's later career, taking
on acting assignments to earn money for
his own filmmaking ventures. Among
other roles, he portraved the husband
who makes a pact with the devil in
Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby
(1968).
Cassavetes's moment in the mainstream
(on his own terms) was indeed brief. As
Hollvwood began to consolidate its new
era of blockbuster epics (with fewer pic-
tures taking up more screens), Cassavetes
continued his unorthodox mode of inde-
pendent production and self-distribution.
After A Woman Under the Influence, his
The Killing of a Chinese 6oo/c;e (1976,
revised version 1978) barely made
it into
theatrical release, while Opening Night
(1978) played only one week in one Los
Angeles theater. These three films com-
prise a remarkable trilogy of independent
production; with their release in video
format, one of the most original directors
in American cinema may finally find an
audience.

inchoate rage becomes focused simultaneously on a pimp and a
political candidate, both of whom are linked to women about
whom Travis obsesses,
if the character's voice-over "diary" and
preparations for violence are not enough to rattle the spectator,
the soundtrack
is also suffused with high-pitched New York street
noise and an alternately jazzy and eerie music score by Bernard
Herrmann, composer for Citizen Kane and many Alfred
Hitchcock films. The film's violence, controversial at the time, has
come to seem less distressing than
its psychological atmosphere,
as Travis's taxi glides through white clouds of steam escaping from
manhole covers in the street, metaphors for his compressed anger
and hatred of the city as an "open sewer."
Other ''Golden Age'' Films
Other important films from this condensed "Golden Age"
included Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the
1975 Academy Award best picture; Robert Altman's Nashville
(1975); All the President's Men (1976), directed by Alan Pakula (b.
1928), centering on newspaper reporters investigating the
Watergate scandal; and Network {]976), directed by Sidney
Lumet (b. 1924),
in which an angry television anchorman exhorts
his viewers to open their windows and shout, "I'm mad as hell
and I'm not going to take
it anymore." This phrase became a pro-
motion tag line for the movie and began appearing as a bumper
sticker on automobiles, expressing a widely felt frustration in an
era of political corruption and military defeat.

THE NEW BLOCKBUSTER
"May the Force be u ith \ou." This mystical salutation, hinting of
subordination to a supernatural Higher Power, replaced
Network's angry outcry within a year as Hollywood's most promi-
nent promotional slogan.
It came from Star Wars (1977), directed
by George Lucas, the phenomenal success that surpassed yaws by
50 percent at the box office, realizing a
little less than S200 mil-
lion in rentals and launching the new blockbuster era of United
States cinema. Through 1993
it has been topped only by Steven
Spielberg's E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), which attained $228
million in rentals. By the end of the 1980s decade, of the top ten
all-time box office hits, Lucas and Spielberg had been involved
with eight—Spielberg as director of five, Lucas as director of Star
Wars and producer of five others, including three of Spielberg's
films.

triumph. Blockbuster pictures since the 1950s— including the

drawn from best-selling novels, Broadway musicals, or similar
well-known sources, and had usually featured star performers. In
contrast, Star Wars had an original script (by Lucas) and no stars.
Though there had been some memorable science fiction films in
the previous decade, notably Kubrick's 2001 : A Space Odyssey
and A Clockwork Orange, the genre was not normally a box
office leader. Beyond the film's remarkable special effects, the
secret of its success lay in
its cultural stance. "Like a breath of
fresh air," wrote the trade paper Variety's reviewer, "Star Wars
sweeps away the cynicism that has in recent years obscured the
concepts of valor, dedication and honor. ... An audience,

entertained, can walk out feeling good all over."' Star Wars repu-
diated the bitter realism of the mid-1970s "Golden Age"— and
offered an antidote.
Star Wars was a children's film for ail ages,
it was less a con-
ventional genre movie than a feature-length version of the old
Saturday matinee serials featuring fictional space adventurers like
Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. But
its narrative and imagery also
drew on standard figures out of WoHd War
II films— callow
young men who learn bravery, uncommitted cynics (like Rick in
Casablanca) who throw their weight behind the forces of good. At
one point the Star Wars saga was planned to encompass nine
films, of which, over the next decade, two more were made: The
Empire Strikes Back ^^980), directed by Irvin Kershner (b. 1923),
and The Return of the jedi {]9Qij, directed by British filmmaker
Richard Marquand (1938-1987). These climbed, respectively, to
fifth and third on the all-time box office
list.
Indiana Jones
The adventure blockbusters managed well without big-name per-
formers. Actor Harrison Ford (b. 1942) was one of the few whom
they made into stars. While playing the cynic, Han Solo,
in the
Star Wars trilogy, he created an even more famous screen charac-
ter, Indiana Jones,
in another trio of Saturday serial-type adventure
movies. Raiders of the Lost A^k{^98^
), Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
(1989). All three were collaborations between Spielberg as direc-
tor and Lucas as producer. Though earthbound rather than space
adventures, they were no less dependent on fantasy and special
effects. Set in the World War
11 era, they sometimes uncomfort-
ably dredged up discarded racial stereotypes in their depiction of
non-Caucasian characters. "Indy," however, was all hero as he
fought the good fight against German Nazis. All three films
earned theatrical box office rentals of over $100 million.
E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial
A year after Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spielberg (without Lucas's
participation) made E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, the most successful
film
in cinema history to date.
Its focus
is on two lost boys— the
California suburbanite Elliott, adrift amid a fractured family, and
the extraterrestrial
left behind by his spaceship. Spielberg's
camera views the world from E.T.'s height, observing
its many
oppressive male authority figures mostly from the waist down.
Like Spielberg's earlier Close Encounters of the Third Kind ('\977),
E.T. combined contemporary social themes with
its fantasy and
special effects. A human and an alien child suffer and triumph
together, only to separate at the end. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial may
come closer to sweeping away cynicism once and for all
in the
world than any other motion picture.
Blockbuster Comedies
Comedy became a part of the new blockbuster phenomenon
with the unexpected box office triumph of a spoof on college fra-
ternity
life. National Lampoon's Animal House (1978), directed by
John Landis (b. 1950). Much of its success was credited to the
manic performance style of John Belushi (1949-1982), a comic
actor making his film debut after gaining wide popularity on the
youth-oriented late-night television program Saturday Night Live.
A showcase for young comic performers, the same series also pro-
pelled
Bill Murray (b. 1950) and Dan Aykroyd (b. 1950), both
from Canada, and later Eddie Murphy (b. 1961
) into film careers.
Murray and Aykroyd appeared in the biggest comedy hit of the
1980s, Ghostbusters (1984), directed by Ivan Reitman (b. 1947),
also from Canada. Murphy took the lead role in the second top
comedy hit, Beverly Hills Cop (1984), directed by Martin Brest
(b. 1951).
New Stars
Besides Harrison Ford and the Saturday Night Live comedians,
the new blockbuster created few other stars. One was Sylvester
Stallone (b. 1946), whose first major success was as an aspiring
boxer from Philadelphia in the inspirational film Rocky (^976),
directed bv John G. Avildsen (b. 1936). As author also of the

Charles Chaplin and Orson Welles to receive Academy Award
nominations as both actor and screenwriter for the same film.
Rocky generated numerous sequels, which Stallone also directed
as well as writing and playing the title role i///and /V actually sur-
passed the original as box office hits). Meanwhile, he created
on-screen an even more emblematic cultural figure, the character
John Rambo in First Blood i]982), directed by Ted Kotcheff (b.
1931
), and Rambo: First Blood Part // (1985), directed by George
P. Cosmatos (b. 1941
). An angry, violent Vietnam war hero,
Rambo returns to Vietnam in Part II to wreak vengeance and res-
cue Americans supposedly
still held as prisoners of war. Rambo
became for many an image of national bellicosity and of a desire
to exorcise defeat in Vietnam.
Another performer who became popular with a strong-man
screen persona was the Austrian former weightlifter Arnold
Schwarzenegger ib. 1947). He developed a following in military
and science fiction action films such as The Terminator {]984),
directed by James Cameron (h. 1954), and Predator {]987),
directed by John McTiernan (b. 1951). Unlike Stallone, however,
he brought a slightly ironic performance style to his super-hero
roles, and he became an even bigger star when his capacity for
comedy and a perhaps incongruous intellectuality were built into
his screen characters. These traits became apparent in two films
directed by Ivan Reitman: Twins (1988),
in which the blond strong
man plays the naive and brainy twin brother of short, dark Danny
DeVito; and Kindergarten Cop (1990),
in which he portrays an
undercover policeman who takes over teaching a kindergarten
class in order to protect a child and catch a killer.
U.S. FILMS AND FILMMAKERS
Future historians ma\ give less weight to the new blockbuster
phenomenon than we have here, since box office success has
rarely been a predictor of which films will gain lasting signifi-
cance. But in the 1980s and beyond these works shaped the
context of United States filmmaking. They dominated exhibition;
they set the standards by which others were judged. Stanley
Kubrick, for example, an outstanding filmmaker by any measure,
attempted a blockbuster with The Shining (1980), from a horror
novel by Stephen King. Kubrick expressed the hope his film would
do half as well as The Empire Strikes Bach,
in the end
it earned
less than one-fourth as much at the box office as the Star Wars
sequel. The Shining was a profitable film but failed to satisfy
grandiose aspirations. Production budgets soared in the 1980s, in
part because of similar hopes, yet the trade paper Variety
reported that only one-fourth of films that cost $14 million or
more to produce earned back production costs at the domestic
box office. These factors weighed on filmmakers whether they
aimed at blockbusters or not. Meanwhile, there were many kinds
of American films and filmmakers, and a number for whom
Hollywood was more of a metaphor than a place of work.
Kubrick, for example, was permanently based in Britain, George
Lucas in northern California, and filmmakers such as Woody
Allen and Martin Scorsese in New York.
Woody Allen
The filmmaking and marketing practices of the writer-director-
performer Allen (b. 1935) offered one of the clearest alternatives
to the blockbuster approach. On a small scale, on the east coast.

Academy Awards as director and
coscreenwriter on Annie Hall

nated as best actor for his role as
Aivy Singer in the film, an
unusual feat of individual recogni-
tion; Aivy (right) shown outside
New York's Beekman Theater
he tried to maintain operations similar to those of the former
studio era: he worked steadily, making at least one film a year,
and insisted that they be distributed slowly, city by city,
in the old
"platform
" method. He reasoned sensibly that few of his films
were amenable to a thousand simultaneous openings in suburban
shopping mall theaters (this practice altered in 1992 after Allen's
personal
life became front-page news and he also changed distri-
bution companies; his film Husbands and Wives opened— none
too successfully— in close to a thousand suburban theaters).
Most of Allen's films featured an unprepossessing central figure,
a neurotic urban Jewish man portrayed by Allen himself, who
struggled in a tragicomic way with daily life and the cosmos. His
most significant critical and financial success was Annie Hall
(1977), which beat out Star Wars, among other films, for the
Academy Award as best picture. That year Allen also won awards
as director and coscreenwriter, and was nominated as best actor,
surpassing Stallone (as well as Chaplin and Welles) for breadth of
individual recognition.
Several other Allen films were also box office successes, includ-
ing Manhattan (1979), concerning an older man's infatuation with
a younger woman, and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), which

dealt with the rivalries and desires among three sisters and the
men
in their lives. Perhaps Allen's most innovative and challeng-
ing work was Zelig (1983),
in which the director portrays a
chameleon-like man
in the 1920s who takes on the character of
his surroundings and can pass as, among other things, a baseball
player, a Chinese man, and an intimate of the famous; the work
parodies film biographies while at the same time questioning
social concepts of identify and selfhood.

was controversial both in triumph and disaster. His triumph was
The Deer Hunfer (1978), Academy Award winner as best picture
and widely regarded as the first significant Hollywood fiction film
imaginatively portraying the American experience of the Vietnam
war, at home and overseas. Moving performances by a strong
cast, headed by Robert De Niro, outweighed for many spectators
imbalances in the film's structure and narrative, yet others were
angered by what they regarded as
its racism toward Asians and
flagrant departure from the historical record.
Lingering dispute over The Deer Hunfer affected attitudes
toward Cimino's next film. Heaven's Cafe (1980), which became
a financial flop of historic dimension. With production costs that

rose to around $36 million, the film became symbolic of extrava-
gance and waste in the production process. Running three hours,
thirty-nine minutes, the epic of Wyoming frontier history was
ravaged by critics and lasted only a week in theaters. A version
seventy-two minutes shorter was later released, but the film
earned back only a small fraction of its costs, and in the wake of
its failure the United Artists company, which financed the film,
was taken over by M-C-M. Cimino's advocates compared him to
Erich von Stroheim as a visionary martyred by the Hollywood
system. The original version of Heaven's Gate, fortunately for stu-
dents and scholars of film history, can be seen on video cassette.
Though
it has structural and narrative difficulties similar to The
Deer Hunter, without the performances that carried the earlier
film. Heaven's Cafe deserves attention as an attempt to extend the
revision of the Western genre through an epic reimagining of the
development of the American West.
Martin Scorsese
Among the early 1970s "movie brats," Martin Scorsese most con-
sistently pursued a traditional career as a commercial director
(while Lucas and Spielberg went into producing as well as direct-
ing blockbusters, Coppola tried to establish his own Hollywood
studio, incurring extensive losses that affected his own filmmaking
endeavors). Nevertheless, when two of Scorsese's most interesting
personal projects. The King of Comedy (1983) and After Hours
(1985), made negligible impact at the box office,
it appeared that
his artistic goals might be incompatible with the commercial sys-
tem. He recovered, however, with a more conventional work, the
aptly named The Color of Money (1986), and he managed to sur-
vive substantial public controversy over the portrayal of the life of
Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), based on a novel by
Nikos Kazantzakis.
Eadier, Scorsese directed what many critics cotisidered the out-
standing Hollywood film of the 1980s decade. Raging fiu// (1980),
a dark, pitiless fictional portrait based on the life of prizefighter
Jake La Motta. The film was shot in black-and-white, unusual for
its time, with additional color sequences made to appear as
if
they had been shot by the characters as home movies.
It featured
a remarkable performance by Robert De Niro as La Motta; the
actor, trim ind a'hietic
in youthful sequences, gained weight to
portray the paunchy, jowly older man. From Mean Streets, their
first film together, through Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and The King
of Comedy, Scorsese and De Niro formed one of the most signifi-
cant director-performer working relationships in American film
history.
It continued in CoodFellas (1990), a satirical film concern-
ing the activities of organized crime, and Cape Fear (1991
), a
remake of a 1962 crime drama.
David Lynch
An even more unconventional career within the commercial film
industry was that of David Lynch (b. 1946). He made his first fea-
ture, fraser/)eac/(1976), as a student project at the American Film
Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies. This disturbing,
dreamlike film became a fixture on the "midnight movie" circuit
that sprang up in the mid-1970s in a few big city theaters, cultivat-
ing audiences for offbeat "cult" films.

Raging Bull shot in black-and-white and also based on an actual

David Lynch's The
Elephant Man
( 1980) was based
on an actual life story of a
nineteenth-century British man
who suffered from a grotesquely
disfiguring disease; John Hurt,
swathed in a mask, portrayed the
title chararacter, John Merrick.

life story, this of a nineteenth-century British man who suffered
from a grotesquely disfiguring disease. Blue Velvet (1986) was yet
another unsettling work, using garish colors as a counterpoint to
the mystery and malevolence
it depicted behind the facade of a
"normal" American small town. Critics ranked Blue Ve/vef along-
side Raging Bull among important works of the decade; a British
writer called Lynch "the most provocative and inspired director in
the American mainstream."^ Twin Peaks, a television series con-
cerning mysterious transgressions in a small northwestern town
that Lynch launched in 1989 as producer and sometime director,
offered considerable provocation and occasional inspiration, but
little of either was evident in the feature films Wild at Heart
(1990), a road movie, and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992),
which closed out the television series and solved
its mysteries.

Ridley Scott
British director Ridley Scott ib. 1939) made two significant films in
Hollywood nearly a decade apart, Blade Runner (^982) and
Thelma and Louise (1991
). Both sparked critical and cultural
debate. Based on a novel by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick,
Blade Runner was a futuristic film noir, concerned with crime and
duplicity in a nightmarish urban world eady in the twenty-first
century. Though not particularly successful when
it opened, and
faulted by critics for weak narrative and static images, the film
became increasingly admired and discussed as a "postmodern"
work, portraying a future where technological wizardry marks a
thin veneer over social malaise and decay, while differences
erode between humans and robots. Blade Runner was rereleased
in 1992
in a longer version described as "the director's cut."

ern" vision of Blade Runner

cal wizardry marks a thin veneer
over social malaise and decay.

Bottom: 22.24. Thelma and
Louise (1991), directed by Ridley
Scott, created controversy by
placing two women in the famil-
iar genre role (formerly occupied
by two men, or a male-female
couple) of fugitives on the run
from the law: Thelma Dickinson
was portrayed by Ceena Davis
(left), Louise Sawyer by Susan
Sarandon.
473

Thelma and Louise created immediate furor. With a screenplay
by woman writer Callie Khouri (b. 1958),
it resembled a genre film
concerning fugitives on the run from the law, but
it transmuted
genre conventions by making
its runaways two women. Though
scores of American films had romanticized male characters in
crime films involving car chases, holdups, and violent death (as
well as male and female couples in works such as Gun Crazy and
Bonnie and Clyde), a controversy arose over placing two women
in those mythologized scenarios. Some critics hailed Thelma and
Louise as a feminist work empowering to women, while others
objected to the film's associating women with genre violence.
Oliver Stone
For controversy, however, no Hollywood figure of the era sur-
passed writer-director Oliver Stone (b. 1946). As a scriptwriter for
works such as Midnight Express (1978, directed by Alan Parker)
and Scarface (1983, directed by Brian De Palma), his films had
been notable for their violence and brutality. As a director, his
works took aim at contentious issues in a blunt, punchy, realist
style, mixed with blatant use of caricature and symbolism. A vet-
eran of active service in Vietnam, Stone won the Academy Award
for best picture with Platoon (1986), hailed by many Vietnam vet-
erans as the most authentic rendering in fiction film of their war
experience. No film in decades aroused such acrimony as Stone's
JFK {^99^), which presented the 1963 assassination of President
John
F. Kennedy as a conspiracy among government officials.
Strongly criticized in many editorials and commentaries, /F/C nev-
ertheless reopened a national debate over the assassination and
its political and social consequences, as well as the role of feature
fiction films in representing and interpreting past historical events.

John Hughes
Writer-director John Hughes (b. 1950) merits consideration
particularly in relation to the status of genre filmmaking in
late-
twentieth-century Hollywood. Genres had been at the core of
Hollywood studio production, as we have seen in earlier chapters,
and their influence persisted through the eras of genre revision,
the "movie brats," and the blockbuster. But by the 1980s few film-
makers were content to make just plain genre films (as opposed to
revisionist or reflexive or hybrid works) and even less to carve
out a niche, an identity, as genre filmmakers. Hughes was an
exception. In the mid-1980s he directed a series of "teen" films
among them Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985),
and Pretty in P/n/c (1986)—that depicted the perennial struggles
of teenage life in the setting of affluent suburbia. Then,
in Ferris
Bueller's Day Off 0986), which became his biggest box office
success, Hughes stepped over to the reflexive mode, treating teen
fantasies and anxieties both seriously and as farce comedy. The
film was couched at times in a pseudo-documentary form, with
the leading character lecturing or hectoring the camera/spectator.
Women Directors
Though the rise of a feminist movement in the 1970s did not
greatly alter Hollywood's status as a male-dominated industry,
women did take prominent roles as producers and screenwriters,
and more women directors made commercial features than ever
before. Women directors helped to revitalize the teen film genre
that John Hughes later commanded. Amy Heckerling (b. 1954)
made her feature debut with Fast Times at RIdgemont High
(1982), which featured young actor Sean Penn (b. 1960), while
Martha Coolidge (b. 1946), a former independent feminist docu-
mentary filmmaker, contributed Valley C/'r/(1983) and Real
Genius (1985) to the genre. Coolidge later directed Rambling
Rose (1991
), a film admired for the performances of actresses
Diane Ladd and Laura Dern, who in actuality are mother and
daughter.
Susan Seidelman (b. 1953), whose film Smithereens {]982)
became the first American independent feature accepted
in the
prize competition at the Cannes film festival, began as a commer-
474

cial director with a comedy, Desperately Seeking Susan (1985),
that introduced a young pop singer, Madonna [Ciccone]. Films by
directors such as Heckerling, Coolidge, and Seidelman raised
anew (as in the cases of Lois Weber and Dorothy Arzner decades
earlier) the question of whether women could bring gender-
based sensibilities to the conventionalized Hollywood mode of
production. "Without being a feminist film," Seidelman said of
Desperately Seeking Susan, "Susan has a distinctly female point
of view. ... A man would have directed differently, a man cer-
tainly wouldn't have written that script."'
Independents
A feature of post-1975 United States filmmaking was increased
opportunity for independents to enter the mainstream.
Independent production companies had always existed within the
Hollywood system, but this was different— filmmakers mostly
working outside Hollywood, whose films would previously have
screened on the nontheatrical, museum, or college circuits, now
got a chance at theatrical distribution.
One aegis for this change was a proliferation of North American
film festivals, where independent films gained publicity and
demonstrated audience interest. Among the first was the New
York Film Festival, founded in 1963, followed by even bigger
events in such cities as Chicago, Montreal, San Francisco, and
Toronto.
In 1980 actor Robert Redford (b. 1937) launched the
Sundance Film Festival
in Park City, Utah, solely as a showcase
for independent features and documentaries. From these events
many independent works found theatrical distributors.

In a support-
ing role, pop singer Madonna
made her leap to stardom as the
title character in Susan
Seidelman's Desperately Seeking

While filmmakers such as Martha Coolidge and Susan
Seidelman moved from independent production to Hollywood,
others maintained varying degrees of distance from the dominant
industry. Significant figures included John Sayles (b. 1948) and Jim
Jarmusch (b. 1953), based respectively in Hoboken, New Jersey,
and New York City. A novelist before and during his film career,
Sayles worked within the commercial system as a screenwriter to
help finance his independent features, beginning with Return of
the Secaucus Seven (1980), a rough but energetic work concern-
ing a reunion of 1960s radicals. In later films, such as Matevvan
(1987) and City of Hope [199]
), Sayles continued to deal with
progressive social topics. Jarmusch found backing for a feature
film, Stranger Than Paradise ^^984), from European producers
475

' 'omen with
Hollywood in the 1970s recognized but
was unable to respond to a paradox:
in
American society at large the women's
movement and feminism were having a
major impact, while in commercial films
important roles for women were in signif-
icant decline. A simple (but hardly
sufficient) explanation for this state of
affairs
is that a male-dominated industry
found itself incapable either of perpetuat-
ing traditional conventions for female
characters or of creating new ones. New
opportunities that opened up for women
to direct did not necessarily resolve the
problem, since most women directors
wanted to demonstrate they could handle
any script or genre, not just specialized
women's stories.
What could women performers without
good roles do about
it? A number of male
stars of the era had gained significant
power to shape their projects and even to

direct them; the question was whether
any female stars possessed similar influ-
ence. One woman clearly of that rank
was the singer-actress Barbra Streisand (b.
1942); after she won an Academy Award
for her first film role, as Fanny Brice in
Funny Girl (1968), directed by William
Wyler, she was in fact taken to task by
critics for not choosing more adventurous
roles or working with leading directors
during the 1970s.
In 1983 Streisand undertook to pro-
duce, cowrite, direct, and star in
YentI,
based on a short story by Isaac Bashevis

pursue her studies. Some critics regarded
the film as a "megalomaniac extrava-
gance," while others admired
it and
pointed out that similar projects by male
stars rarely received such dismissive com-
ments. Streisand returned as producer,
director, and star of The Prince of Tides
(1991
), to which responses were also
divided. The film was nominated for an
Academy Award as best picture but
Streisand was not nominated as director.
A television star (on the situation com-
edy Laverne & Shirley), Penny Marshall
(b. 1942) turned to film directing in
the mid-1980s, but not as a director-
performer. She had a considerable
success with her second film. Big (1988),
a sentimental comedy concerning a
twelve-year-old boy who
is transformed
overnight (in size, not in mind) into an
adult; actor Tom Hanks (b. 1957) played
the lead role. Her next films, Awakenings
(1990), concerning a doctor and his
patients in a hospital for neurological dis-
eases, and A League of Their Own
(1992), dealing with women who play
professional baseball in a women's
league during and after World War
II
(with Geena Davis and Madonna among
the lead performers), were also criticized
for sentimentality but became substantial
box office hits.

and television networks, which had become significant supporters
of United States independents. This spare black-and-white film
won praise for
its minimalist irony. Jarmusch brought subtle com-
edy and an international cast of performers to further films, such
as Down by /.aw (1986) and Mystery Train (1989),
in which he
explored contemporary anomie.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN
FILMMAKERS
The openness to independents was particularly significant for
African-American filmmakers. While films such as Nothing but a
Man and performances by Sidney Poitier brought new perspec-
tives to representations of blacks in United States cinema during
the 1960s (see Chapter 20), opportunities had been slower to
come for black directors.
This began to change at the end of the 1960s decade, when
noted magazine photographer Cordon Parks (b. 1912) directed
as well as produced, wrote, and composed the music for
The
Learning Tree (1969), based on his own autobiographical writings.
However, his very different second film, Sha^f (1971
), an urban
crime thriller featuring a black private detective portrayed bv
Richard Roundtree (b. 1937), was considerably more influential. A
surprise box office hit. Shaft launched two sequels, a television
series, and a short-lived film movement known as "blaxploita-
tion" films (the term combined the words blacks and
exploitation).
These violent crime and action films filled a subgenre niche for
urban black audiences for several years before blockbusters began
to dominate exhibition. More than three dozen blaxploitation
films were made in the period from 1972 to 1975; black filmmak-
ers, including Poitier, Ossie Davis (b. 1917), Gordon Parks,
Jr.
(1935-1979), and Ivan Dixon (b. 1931), the male lead performer
in Nothing but a Man, got to direct a few.
477

Mehin Van Peebles
Without minimizing the experience and exposure blaxploitation
films offered black directors and performers,
it
is clear that the
movement was more concerned with traditional genre conven-
tions than
it was with expressing black viewpoints on
contemporary society. A filmmaker who laid the groundwork
more directly for a distinctive black perspective in fiction features
was Melvin Van Peebles (b. 1932). Even earlier than Gordon
Parks, Van Peebles made the first important film of the 1960s by a
black director, La Permission (The Story of a Three-Day Pass,
1968), but
it was produced in France, where Van Peebles had
gone to get his start as a director. His Hollywood opportunity
came with Watermelon Man (1970), a comedy about a white
who turns black.
Its principal (perhaps only) virtue was that
it pro-
vided income Van Peebles used to fund an independent project,
Sweef Sweetback's Bad Asssss Song (1971
),
in which he also
played the lead role.
A violent, controversial film, expressing black anger and dedi-
cated to "all the Brothers and Sisters who had enough of the
Man," Sweef Sweef6ac/f developed myths of rebellion similar to
those in the films of Brazilian Glauber Rocha and other filmmak-
ers of the Cinema of Liberation (see Chapter 18). Independently
distributed,
it became a major success with black audiences.
When "blaxploitation" films swept the market, however. Van
Peebles shifted to television and theater. Nevertheless, 5weef
Sweetback remained as a marker for a new generation when
black independents found
it possible to break into the mainstream
more on their own terms in the 1980s.
Sp>ike Lee
The first black filmmaker to exploit the new opportunities was
Spike Lee (full name Shelton Jackson Lee, b. 1957). Lee made a
distinctive debut with an independent feature. She's Cotta Have It
(1986), a film shot in twelve days, partly in color and partly black-
and-white, on a $175,000 budget funded largely by foundation
grants. Lee was writer, director, editor, and one of the lead per-
formers, and he used four members of his family in the cast and
crew. A skillful promoter, he quickly branched into music video
and book tie-ins for the film, and turned the slight, bespectacled
character he portrayed. Mars Blackmon, into a partner of basket-
ball star Michael Jordan in television commercials that Lee
directed. She's Cotta Have It was not universally applauded:
many critics faulted the work as a sex farce at the expense of its
lead female character.
Gaining backing from a major studio, Lee showed his icono-
clastic approach by making an unconventional, challenging film,
School Daze (1988), a musical set at a black college that centers
on conflicts between light-skinned and dark-skinned blacks. Later
films continued his exploration of controversial issues in race rela-
tions, with an eclectic visual and narrative style combining realist
and anti-realist techniques: Do the Right Thing (1989) deals with
racial violence growing out of tensions at an Italian-American
pizza parlor in a black neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York;
Jungle Fever (1991
) focuses on a love affair between a black man
and an Italian-American woman.

fame in the 1960s, was released. With JFKoi the previous year,
Malcolm X demonstrated how ambitious historical films can sig-
nificantly awaken awareness and revise debate on controversial
recent events.
New Black Filmmakers
Lee's box office success made clear that a substantial audience
existed for films expressing black viewpoints. In 1991, two
decades after Shaft, another black film movement began, one far
more concerned with black perspectives and giving voice to
voung black filmmakers. More than a dozen films by black direc-
tors were released that year, a higher total of mainstream
commercial films than in the entire 1980s decade, and many
were debut features.
The most prominent was Boyz N the Hood (1991
), directed by
twenty-three-year-old John Singleton (b. 1968), which Columbia
Pictures distributed as a mini-blockbuster, opening the film simul-
taneously in nearly one thousand theaters. Boyz N the Hood was
a strongly realist treatment of black
life in south central Los
Angeles, focusing on the struggles of young men to grow up amid
gang violence. Black critic Armand White assessed the film's sig-
nificance, writing that in Boyz N the Hood, "black teens see life
in terms of survival," while in the 1980s teen genre, "white teens
see
it in terms of fun.""*
BEYOND FORMULA
By the early 1990s, a vigorous movement of independent film-
makers appeared to be thriving within the framework of a
dominant commercial filmmaking practice that continued to
emphasize blockbusters, sequels, and traditional genres. Some
film industry executives conceded that their formulas and conven-
tions, while frequently popular and financially successful, lacked
the combination of entertainment and artistry that had been a
hallmark of American commercial cinema in the past.
"Hollywood movies aren't as good as they used to be," said
Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of Walt Disney Pictures.^ A nos-
talgia for more adventurous filmmaking eras was evident, and
some commentators hoped for a revival of the late 1960s atmos-
phere when new talent and new ideas reshaped American film
(though not wishing, one assumes, for the extreme financial dis-
tress the film industry suffered in that period).
While no single awards season makes a trend, some critics saw
a possible sign of renewal
in the prevalence of independent and
foreign films among nominees for Hollywood's 1993 Academy
Awards (at least eight of the twenty nominations for best picture,
actor, actress, and director came from such titlesK Among films
with the most nominations were Howards fnc/(1992), from a
novel by E. M. Forster, by the veteran literary adapters director
lames Ivory (b. 1928) and producer Ismail Merchant (b. 1936),
and The Crying Came (1992), an unusual political thriller by Irish
director Neil Jordan (b. 1950). In the event, the best picture award
went as expected to Unforgiven (1992), in which director and
lead performer Clint Eastwood not only restored vitality to the
Western genre but also demonstrated a capacity for genre revision
reminiscent of the 1960s; Eastwood also won the directing award.

The mixing
board at the Sound One
recording studio in New
York City
When film theorists speak of cinematic
realism, they almost invariably refer
solely to the screen image. Debates over
Italian neorealism, for example, rarely
find any impediment to the concept of
realism
in the fact that sound was not
recorded simultaneously with the image
but added later in a studio (indeed this
has been seen as an enhancement to
realism because
it freed the camera for
mobile location shooting).
Is film sound realistic because
it
resembles our conception of the sounds
of the actual world, because
it enhances
the properties of visual realism, or
because
it
is recorded from actuality?
If
the last of these three definitions
is
chosen, then very
little film sound
is
"real"— in a strict sense, only the sound-
tracks of cinema verite or direct cinema
documentaries (and a few fiction films)
that use only sound directly recorded
with the image. Even
in feature films that
record synchronized dialogue, a sub-
stantial portion of the soundtrack
is
created in postproduction. Two of the
places where that occurs are the Foley
stage and the mixing studio.
Who
is the only person to have a film
credit named after him? The answer
is
lack Foley, an early innovator of special
sound effects in radio and movies. The
men and women who make such effects
have become known (and receive
screen credit) as "Foley artists." Their
job
is to supplement the work of the
sound recordist, who concentrates on
dialogue when a shot
is made. They pro-
duce the incidental noises that make up
the sound background
in a scene, such
as footsteps, doors closing, the rustle of
clothing; their sounds can call attention
to facets of the visual image and
advance the narrative just as insert shots
do. They also create sounds that for
obvious reasons cannot be directly
recorded: Foley artists have a habit of
citing as an example the sound of a
head being hit, which they make by
smashing a watermelon.
All the sounds for a film come
together in the mixing studio to make a
film's single soundtrack; the dialogue
recorded during a shot, additional dia-
logue rerecorded in postproduction
(known as ADR), the Foleys, other
effects (usually from a stock sound
library; for example, the sound of a jet
airplane taking off), and music. As many
as one hundred separate recorded tracks
may be premixed to reduce the number
the mixers work with to two or three
dozen. Each of the premixed tracks
is
connected to a fader on the mixing

TWENTY-THREE
HECINEMATIC
T
H
The French term avanf-garc/e signifies a vanguard
those who march in front, keep ahead of the pack. In
I
the arts,
it defines creators who break with standard
conventions and push beyond accepted limits of form.
In cinema, vanguard filmmakers have been designated by such
terms as "experimental" or "underground." Earlier chapters gave
attention to avant-garde filmmaking from the era prior to World
War
II. Here further manifestations of noncommercial or anti-
mainstream cinema will be traced through the postwar decades.
It
has been a period of diverse and sometimes contradictory trends
for avant-garde filmmaking, containing extreme forms of film
experiment along with greater opportunities for vanguard film-
makers to move closer to the mainstream.
In the World War
II era, fascism and war drove many of
Europe's avant-garde filmmakers into exile. Hollywood companies
played an important role in their support, as the studios also had
done with other film workers. Among pioneer vanguard figures,
for example, Rene Clair, maker of Paris qui dort and Entr'acte (see
Chapter 6), spent the war years in the United States directing fic-
tion features. Luis Bunuel, maker of Un Chien andalou, worked in
New York and later in Hollywood, where he was hired to dub fea-
tures into Spanish. While these circumstances were shaped by
war's disruptions— Clair returned to France after the war and
Bunuel (as we have seen) went on to Mexico and eventually to
Europe—they suggest a more complex relationship between
Hollywood and the avant-garde than one might assume.
Mainstream cinema served not only as an aesthetic antagonist for
vanguard filmmakers but also as a source for imagery, an occa-
sion for commentary or parody, and sometimes a goal. As
it
happened, not entirely by coincidence, the film that launched the
postwar avant-garde movement was made privately in Hollywood
during the war, not far from the studios' doors.
MAYA DEREN
The film was Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), a fourteen-minute
work by Maya Deren (1917-1961
) with Alexander Hammid (b.
1907).
It has become one of the most famous avant-garde films in
cinema history and perhaps the best documented, thanks to a
remarkable publishing project. The Legend of Maya Deren, by
VeVe A. Clark, Millicent Hodson, and Catrina Neiman, which has
compiled
in two volumes more than a thousand pages of docu-
ments, interviews, and film criticism covering the first thirty years
of Deren's
life (with more books to come on her later years).
Born
in Russia and brought to the United States with her family
as a child, Deren was preparing a book on dance and traveling
with a dance company when she arrived in Los Angeles, where
she met and married Hammid, a filmmaker in exile from
Czechoslovakia. Deren took up photography and poetry,
in late
spring 1943, just before moving to New York, the couple decided
to make a film. They shot
it with a 16mm camera without sound
(a music soundtrack was added years later) and without a sce-
nario, planning shots as they went along and performing the roles
themselves.
Meshes of the Afternoon has been described
in many ways
as a film poem, a dream film, a trance film, as a work that forms a
bridge between the prewar European Surrealist avant-garde and
the postwar self-exploratory "New American Cinema." Deren

portrays a woman who enters an apartment, sits down
in an
armchair, and falls asleep. The film's images then become her
increasingly disorienting and violent dreams, shot at odd angles
and in slow motion. Household objects take on ominous charac-
ter in the dream sequences, and her "self" splits into three
identical figures, two of whom appear together in double-expo-
sure shots. Just as one of the dream women appears to stab the
sleeping woman with a kitchen knife, a man (Hammid) intervenes
and waking life seems to return. But at the end the man finds the
woman dead in the armchair. Nearly every shot of Meshes of the
Afternoon conveys a distinct beauty and mystery, and repeated
viewings suggest few pat psychological or symbolic explanations.
In New York, working on her own, Deren continued to make
short dreamlike films and to promote her film aesthetics through
screenings and writings. After the war, communities of filmmak-
ers, critics, and audiences formed in the United States on both
east and west coasts. New York's Cinema 16 was established as a
film society on the model of prewar European "cine-clubs." In
San Francisco, the Museum of Art inaugurated a historic series.
Art in Cinema, that screened European avant-garde classics and
the works of Deren and her contemporaries, such as The Potted
Psalm (1946) by Sidney Peterson ib. 1905
1 and lames Broughton
(b. 1912), who collaborated on this debut film and then went on
separately to careers as independent filmmakers. Another signifi-
cant first appearance was Fireworks (1947i, a symbolically
homoerotic work by a seventeen-year-old filmmaker, Kenneth
Anger (b. 1930), who had been making short films since he was
eleven. An "underground" film culture gradually developed in the
United States in the first decade after the war. But
it was not until
the late 1950s-early 1960s, when the country entered a period of
political and cultural transformations and a crisis in mainstream
filmmaking also became apparent, that independent and avant-
garde films began to make wider impact.
ALTERNATIVE FILMS
OF THE 1960S
Among all the possible designations for the vanguard film move-
ments of the 1960s, "alternative" works best because
it
is most
broad— it encompasses the experimental and the underground,
the filmmakers who called themselves New American Cinema,
the emergence of gay-related films, and any other subcategories
identifiable in the world of noncommercial cinema. What held
them together was expressed in The Connection (1961
), a film by
Shirley Clarke (b. 1925
1, when a character who
is making a docu-
mentary film explains his aesthetic approach: "I'm not interested,"
he says, "in making a Hollywood picture."
Shirley Clarke
Clarke's The Connection brought to the surface of its narrative a
question that was central to nearly all aspects of alternative film-
making: what
it means to shoot a film, and to be filmed—to look
and to be looked at. In adapting Jack Gelber's drama about
heroin addiction, performed on stage and for the film by the
Living Theatre, the director and the playwright (who wrote the
script) added the framing device of a filmmaker and his camera-
man making a film in a drug addicts' pad. In the course of
483

Clarke's film the fictional filmmaker becomes hooked on the drug
himself, and his final words are addressed to the cameraman and,
through the lens, to the spectator:
"It's all yours now." Besides the
implied appeal here both for artistic and for social action. The
Connection amply conveys the potential for danger and destruc-
tiveness in filmmaking, as well as in drug taking.
Stan Brakhage
Another name for alternative filmmaking was "personal" film, to
distinguish
it from the films of an industry and to suggest that an
alternative mode of production could be one person with a cam-
era, or even one person splicing together or scratching on found
footage. Stan Brakhage (b. 1933) once made a film by sticking
flower petals and moth wings between strips of splicing tape
{Mothlight, 1963). Brakhage was perhaps the most direct succes-
sor to Maya Deren as a "film poet," and indeed his film aesthetics
were more closely aligned with contemporary poetry than the
vague notion of "film poet" would suggest.
Prolific as a writer, lecturer, and filmmaker, Brakhage made
more than one hundred films since beginning his career in the
1950s. A centerpiece was Dog Star Man (1964), a multipart film
that links consciousness, nature, and myth through superimposed
images and manual manipulation of the film surface with paint
and scratches. After finishing Dog Star Man, he took the work
apart and made an even longer film. The Art of Vision (1965),
which played the superimposed images separately and then
together in different combinations. Brakhage's concern with see-
ing and being seen was carried forward
in a radically different
style in The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes (1971
), a medita-
tion on autopsies conducted in the Pittsburgh morgue.
Kenneth Anger
The precocious filmmaker of Fireworks took the personal film
in a
different direction from Brakhage, toward magic,
ritual, and a crit-
ical engagement with popular culture through image and sound.
His most widely known film, Scorpio Rising {^963), counter-
pointed
its images with commercial rock-and-roll songs of the
1950s and early 1960s, and the music and his own photographed
scenes of a motorcycle gang initiation were in turn juxtaposed
with
still photographs and clips from Hollywood films and televi-
sion programs. Both comic and portentous, Scorpio Risings
aesthetic
is linked, as several critics have suggested, to Sergei
Eisenstein's "Montage of Attractions" (see Chapter 7),
in which
the shock of perception from the clash of linked images
is more
important than the underlying narrative.

in an all-night session with mem-
bers of the Living Theatre stage
company.
Jonas Mekas
Born
in Lithuania, Jonas Mekas (b. 1922) came to the United
States in 1950 after years in European displaced persons' camps
and became the key organizing figure of New American Cinema,
as well as a filmmaker. He was the founder in 1955 and longtime
chief editor of Film Culture magazine, which chronicled the
underground and avant-garde; an influential columnist on inde-
pendent film for the New York weekly newspaper The Village
Voice (the columns were collected
in his book Movie Journal: The
Rise of a New American Cinema, 1959-1971); an organizer of
the Film-makers Cooperative in 1961, which distributed indepen-
dent films, and the Film-makers Cinematheque in New York in
1963, which exhibited them; and a founder in 1970 of Anthology
Film Archives in New York, which screens films and houses an
archive and library of printed materials pertaining to independent
films.
In 1964 Mekas made The Brig, one of the remarkable films of
the period. Like The Connection,
it derives from a stage produc-
tion by the Living Theatre, of a play by Kenneth Brown set in a
U.S. Marine Corps brig, or base prison. After the play closed,
Mekas restaged
it during a marathon all-night session and shot his
film as he walked among the performers carrying a camera and
sound recording equipment. The result
is a harrowing, claustro-
phobic rendering of dehumanization and oppression.
Michael Snow
Canadian filmmaker Michael Snow (b. 1929), who worked in
New York during the 1960s, was a leading figure in a late 1960s
movement that became known as "structural film."
If, as we have
seen, a central project of alternative filmmaking was to foreground
the act of making a film, the experiences of seeing and being seen
on film, structural
filn^is gave primacy not to the filmmaker's con-
sciousness but to the technological workings of the apparatus. In
structural film, critic
P. Adams Sitney has written, "the shape of
the whole film
is predetermined and simplified, and
it
is that
shape which
is the primal impression of the film."' Snow's
Wavelength (1967)
is a forty-five-minute fixed-camera zoom
(it
consists of several shots spliced together, because of the length
limits of film
rolls) going from the widest to the smallest field of
vision. His <—
» (also known as Back and Forth, 1969) shows a con-
tinual series of panning— movements from
left to right, right to
left.
In both films events occur, sounds are heard, people are
glimpsed; but human activities are decentered, peripheral to the
inexorable movement of the machine for seeing, which takes on
seemingly a
life and a story of its own.

alternative cinema's version of a motion picture studio at the
Factory, his loft space in New York. While standard filmographies

until 1968 (when he was shot and wounded by a woman at the
Factory), and as producer, with Paul Morrissey (b. 1939) as direc-
tor, thereafter, the question of who wrote, shot, or directed which
"Warhol" films
is far from settled, and perhaps irrelevant. They
were as much products of a worldview and a mode of production
as the films of M-G-M—though quite different in nearly every
respect.
Most of Warhol's films were not widely seen when they were
made and for several decades were almost entirely out of circula-
tion. When many became available again after Warhol's death,
they generated considerable interest, and Warhol's work seems
certain to become more familiar. His first films were of stationary
objects, shot without sound and in black-and-white, with no cam-
era movement and
little movement in the screen image. Sleep
(1963) was a six-hour film of a man sleeping, and Empire (1964)
an eight-hour film of the Empire State Building, whose aesthetic
interest derives from the changing gradations of light and darkness
in the black-and-white image. Nearly everyone who came into
the Factory was filmed in static close-up for the length of a film
roll, three and one-half minutes; selections from these moving
image photographs were assembled in The Thirteen Most
Beautiful Women (1964) and The Thirteen Most Beautiful Boys
(1965). "You could do more things watching my movies than with
other kinds of movies," Warhol told an interviewer in 1967. "You
could eat and drink and smoke and cough and look away and
then look back and they'd
still be there.
It's not the ideal movie,
it's just my kind of movie."'
Warhol began making sound films, with scripts and performers,
in 1965. Chelsea Girls (1966) was his most circulated film, and
indeed
it marked a breakthrough of alternative cinema into
commercial exhibition. The film consisted of twelve reels each
thirty-five minutes in duration, but two reels were projected
side-by-side, so the viewing time was about three and one-half
hours. Though a narrative order was later suggested for the reels,
Warhol's original idea was to
let the projectionist decide which
reels to show in whatever order and juxtaposition. Each reel was
set in a separate room of New York's Chelsea Hotel, where figures
from the 1960s "underground" acted out their personas. Among
Warhol's dozens of other films. My Hustler (1965) has attracted
attention as an important early work exploring issues of gay
culture and style through the alternative cinema's inevitable
concerns, looking and being looked at,
in lengthy, single-take
scenes.
EUROPEAN
ALTERNATIVE CINEMA
Alternative cinema played a different role in Europe than in the
United States after World War
11. With festivals fostering an art
film aesthetic within the commercial system, vanguard filmmakers
such as Robert Bresson
in France could find places for themselves
as part of the mainstream. New Wave movements gave opportu-
nities to young filmmakers earlier than
in Hollywood, and
challenging figures ranging from Alain Resnais,
in France at the
end of the 1950s, to Rainer Werner Fassbinder,
in West Germany
at the end of the 1960s, were able to pursue commercial careers.
European experimental and underground filmmaking did signifi-
cantly expand during the 1960s, but few from this group became
well known to international audiences, most notable among them
the Austrian Peter Kubelka (b. 1934) for his intense short abstract
films such as Unsere Afrikareise {Our Trip to Africa, 1966).
It was
only in the 1970s that a distinctive alternative film practice
developed, largely in the context of feminist-oriented filmmaking,
even though some feminist filmmakers released their work
commercially.
488

Jean-Marie Straiib and Daniele Huillet
The most significant precursors to the 1970s movement were
Jean-Marie Straub (b. 1933) and Daniele Huillet (b. 1936), a hus-
band-wife filmmaking team. Born in France, they worked in
Germany during the 1960s and in Italy thereafter. Though they
shared screen credit, with Huillet's name coming first, many
critics referred to their work solely as Straub's— a sign of the
necessity for greater recognition of women's contribution to cin-
ema. Their first feature-length film, Chronik der Anna Magdalena
Bach (Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach, 1968) addressed the
historical subject of a male artist, the eighteenth-century com-
poser Johann Sebastian Bach, through the consciousness of his
wife. A controversial work dealing with recent German history in
a framework of formal experimentation was Nicht Versohnt oder
Es hilft nur Gewalt, wo Cewalt herrschtiNot Reconciled, or Only
Violence Helps Where Violence Rules, 1968). The film condenses
a well-known novel by German author Heinrich Boll, Billiards at
Half-Past Nine, into less than an hour of screen time, mixing
scenes from various historical periods without clear differentia-
tion, and using nonprofessional actors who were coached to
speak their lines in stilted ways.
Its break from conventional narra-
tive coherence and performance style marked Not Reconciled
(the short title by which the film
is known) as among the most
radical avant-garde works produced in Europe since World War
II.
visitors during the day while her teenage son
is away at school.
Portrayed by Delphine Seyrig (1932-1990), who played the
woman in Resnais's Last Year in Marienbad and appeared in films
of Truffaut and Bunuel, the character Jeanne Dielnian follows a
stolid routine without expression. Over the tilm's three-hour, forty-
five-minute screen time, the persevering spectator becomes
immersed in the mundane details of her daily activity and as agi-
tated as she by slight disruptions. Jeanne's final brief eruption into
murderous violence seems grounded in the atmospheric tension
of Akerman's focus on minutiae, rather than psychological expla-
nation or narative logic.
With support from a West German television network, along
with Belgian and French sources, Akerman made a significant but
also ambiguous step from alternative cinema toward the tradi-
tional mainstream European art film with Les Rendez-vous
d'Anna (literally "Anna's Meeting Places," the film circulates
under its original
title, 1978), concerning the travels and emo-
tional
life of a young woman filmmaker. In this and subsequent
films Akerman tried to develop the commercial possibilities of
women's alternative cinema by situating feminist viewpoints
within more conventional narrative and genre frameworks. A
number of other women filmmakers attempted this shift in the
1980s, and British critic Pam Cook assessed the mixed outcome:
"A refusal to compromise aesthetic principles has resulted in the
discovery that minimalist rigour and anti-narrative experiment do
not necessarily travel well." Cook described a "between-cinemas
limbo," neither fully alternative nor completely commercial, as a
zone where some films by European and North American women
filmmakers ended up during this period."*
Laura Mulvey-Peter Wollen
The films cowritten and directed by British filmmakers Laura
Mulvey (b. 1941
) and Peter Wollen (b. 1938) hold interest not only
for their place in a feminist-oriented alternative cinema but
because the filmmakers were also important film theorists. Wollen
wrote Signs and Meaning in the Cinema (1969), a groundbreaking

Among the first filmmakers born after the war to gain prominence
in alternative cinema was Chantal Akerman (b. 1950). Born in
Belgium, Akerman began making films there while in her teens
and in her early twenties spent several years in New York devel-
oping her work in the context of North American vanguard
filmmaking. Her later films synthesized two strands of avant-garde
aesthetics, the poetic subjectivity deriving from Deren and
Brakhage and the rigorous structuralism associated with Snow.
Critics have called her style "minimalist," since her films utilize a
realist mise-en-scene but eschew conventional narrative plots.

work on authorship and film semiology, the science of signs;
Mulvey in 1975 published perhaps the most influential theoretical
article of the era, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," utiliz-
ing psychoanalytic theory to postulate pleasure in narrative
cinema as a consequence of representing women as objects for
men to look at/' As filmmakers, supported by the British Film
Institute (BFI) Production Board, their works, such as Riddles of
the Sphinx (1977), explored feminist themes in a style combining
structural aesthetics and minimalist narrative.
Sally Potter
A short film that gained attention for
its feminist revision of an
opera classic was Thriller {]979}, made by British filmmaker
Sally Potter (b. 1949). The thirty-three-minute work interrogates
Giacomo Puccini's La Boheme, the popular opera set in the
bohemian world of nineteenth-century Paris.
In the opera the
poet Rodolfo and the poor, sickly seamstress Mimi
fall
in love,
separate, then reunite just before Mimi's death.
In Potter's film
Mimi returns after her death to conduct a kind of inquest as to
its
cause. The "reincarnated" Mimi asks herself, "What
if
I had been
the subject of this scenario instead of its object?," questioning the
way she has no choice in the narrative but to be vulnerable, pas-
sive, and doomed, simply because a young woman's death
is a
convenient source of sentimental or thrilling effects. Her inquest
concludes that she was "murdered" by the conventions of popular
narrative. Potter went on to make a feature film. The Cold Diggers

the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), that employed a

(1974), a collage work concerned
with issues of the 1970s feminist
movement in the United States
made by Austrian t'ilmmaker Valie Export (b. 1940). With a
woman photographer-videomaker as
its protagonist, the work
is
linked with Heike Sander's Redupers (see Chapter 21
), which also
features a woman photographer (Sander appears in Invisible
Adversaries in a televised speech). The film
is concerned with the
notion of the human "double." The photographer fears that aliens
have taken over human bodies, as in the 1950s Hollywood sci-
ence fiction film Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In one scene the
woman and her boyfriend are arguing, while their images on
video monitors repeat their words a second
later; then the video
images speak first, and the humans repeat the lines a second later.
The work expands from personal psychology to confront Austria's
twentieth-century history and examine what
it sees as the nation's
repressive institutions.
ALTERNATIVE CINEMA
IN THE 1980S
By the mid-1980s the place of alternative filmmaking in cinema
culture had changed fundamentally from what
it had been only a
decade or so previously. The vitality and visibility of a separate
avant-garde film movement, with a distinct audience and critical
community, had considerably diminished. Yet alternative film-
makers who pursued unconventional styles and espoused
unorthodox viewpoints were finding greater opportunities than
ever before to secure commercial distribution (to be sure, not on a
blockbuster scale, but in "art cinemas"
in big cities and university
towns) and attract mainstream critical attention. As a conse-
quence, distinctions between vanguard cinema and independent
narrative films became blurred.
It seemed possible that the pace
of experimentation in film form had slowed (defining film form in
this context as an aspect of artistic practice, rather than of
commercial innovation
in such areas as computed-generated
manipulation of the image).
Yvonne Rainer
The leading alternative woman filmmaker in the United States
following Maya Deren and Shirley Clarke was Yvonne Rainer (b.
1934), a former dancer who began making short films to screen
during live performances in the 1960s. Her first feature-length
work. Lives of Performers (1972), drew on her performance pieces
and emphasized issues of women's identity and the role of power
in sexual relations that were central to the feminist film movement
(Mangolte was cinematographer on this and two subsequent
Rainer films). Rainer's works have been characterized as collage
cinema. Film About a Woman Who

. (1974), for example,
utilizes image juxtapositions and image/sound contrasts, such as
voice-over with a blank screen,
still frames alternating with mov-
ing images, on-screen text, and voice-overs speaking sentence
fragments. Her subjects ranged from intimate desires to public
policies, and her treatments fulfilled the 1970s feminist tenet, "the
personal
is political." The Man Who Envied Women (1985) inte-
grates fictional segments (in which characters extensively discuss
and quote from contemporary theorists such as Michel Foucault,
the French philosopher whose works explored the relation
between power and knowledge) with actuality footage of a hear-
ing on housing for artists in New York's lower east side.
Lizzie Borden
One of the most unusual films to come out of the feminist film
movement was Born in Flames (1983), a futurist political fantasy
made by Lizzie Borden (b. 1954). In style the work
is a hybrid of
conventional narrative and direct cinema techniques, shaping the
spectator's awareness that what was ostensibly set in the future
quite deliberately concerned the present. In the film's not so dis-
tant future, a social democratic revolution has taken place in the
United States, but women have not benefited. Militant women
organize and protest, suffer repression, and turn to violence. The
work was vigorously debated among political and women's
groups as to whether
it offered serious political analysis or genre
filmmaking with a political veneer. Borden also made Working

Girls (1986), concerning women in a New York brothel, with a
similar amalgam of narrative and documentary styles. Another
feminist filmmaker working with narrative in a vanguard frame-
work was Bette Cordon (b. 1950), whose Variety (1983) focused
on a woman ticket seller at a pornographic movie theater,
ambiguously exploring sexuality and pornography.
Raul Ruiz
Though border crossings by filmmakers had been common
in cin-
ema history, the experience of exile— of separation or expulsion
from one's home country— nevertheless held a special meaning.
Filmmakers had been forced into or had voluntarily chosen exile
from Russia after 1917, from Germany and other European coun-
tries under Fascism, and from Czechoslovakia after 1968, among
many instances; in the world of the avant-garde, prominent exiles
included Dimitri Kirasanov from Russia to Paris in the 1920s (see
chapter 7) and Jonas Mekas from Lithuania to New York in the
1950s. A figure who brought renewed focus on exile and alterna-
tive cinema was Raul Ruiz (b. 1941
), a Chilean filmmaker who
was compelled to leave his country following a violent military
coup in 1973. Ruiz eventually settled
in France and launched a
prolific career in theater, video, and film under the auspices of
L'Institut National de I'Audiovisuel (National Audiovisual
Institute).
The hallmark of Ruiz's filmmaking
is an intense storytelling
style whose purpose seems ironically to call into question the
coherence of narrative, the capacities of stories to tell anything at
all except their own indeterminacy. His narratives often take the
form of seeking an answer to a puzzle that the narrative itself
poses, and the answer turns out to be another philosophical rid-
dle.
In L'Hypothese du tableau vole (The Hypothesis of the Stolen
Painting, 1978) a collector tries to uncover the hidden meaning of
a series of paintings by staging more and more elaborate tableaux
vivant ("living pictures,"
in which people hold the poses of sub-
jects in paintings), which place in question not only narrative but
the moving image itself. Les Trois Couronnes du mateiot (Three
Crowns of the Sailor, 1983) opens with a murder; the murderer, to
effect his escape, agrees to listen to a sailor tell his life story. At
the end of the sailor's strange, disjointed narrative the murderer
murders the storyteller (perhaps a few spectators may have felt the
same urge). But the murdered sailor appears again— incoherent
or not, narrative will always be with us.
Wayne Wang
Support for alternative filmmaking by governments or public
institutions, common in many countries, became a factor in the
United States with the establishment in 1965 of the National
Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and
in 1967 of the American Film
Institute (AFI), which received federal funding through the NEA.
Among films awarded production grants from these two bodies, a
work that gained wide attention was Chan
Is Missing (^983), a
seventy-six-minute feature film produced on a minuscule budget
of $23,000 by Wayne Wang (b. 1949). Born
in Hong Kong, Wang
set out to depict the complex cross-cultural
life of San Francisco's

j^aiighters of the /just
When Daughters of the Dust (1992),
directed by Julie Dash (b. 1952), became
the first feature film by an African-
American woman to attain commercial
theatrical distribution
in the United
States,
it was a case not of alternative
filmmaking accommodating itself to the
mainstream but of the opposite: the main-
stream opening up to new filmmaking
visions. Dash's work on black culture and
family
life on the Sea Islands off the coast
of South Carolina and Georgia, set at the
beginning of the twentieth century, gave
voice in particular to the consciousness
of African-American women as had
rarely,
if ever, been accomplished in a
feature film before.
Even as a special case— as an African-
American woman—Julie Dash in her
development as a filmmaker exemplifies
in many ways the transformations of her
generation. Crowing up in New York
City, in her teenage years she attended a
workshop in filmmaking at the Studio
Museum of Harlem and began shooting
film.
It was the late 1960s-early 1970s
and, "because of the political climate of
the times," as she told an interviewer, the
documentary form was in demand. "You
could just grab a camera and shoot,
shoot, shoot. There was so much stuff on
the street happening and you could just
shoot
it and then come back and edit
it
into story. We had a goal, at one point, of
doing newsreels for the community.
Everything was community oriented."
But Dash discovered there was a differ-
ence between the demand for
issue-related documentaries and what
people in the community would actually
go and see. Though narrative fiction was
in disrepute among young black filmmak-

ers in the era of conventionalized blax-
ploitation action films, nevertheless
audiences wanted narratives— that they
could relate to. After graduating from City
College of New York with a degree in film
production. Dash went to the heart of
narrative fiction filmmaking: Los Angeles.
She won admission to the Center for
Advanced Film Studies at the American
Film Institute and developed her filmmak-
ing style, particularly, she has said, from
working with an international group of
students who eschewed the formulas of
commercial feature films.
Dash gained attention with Illusions
(1983), a thirty-four-minute fiction film
concerning a black woman who passes
for white to become a Hollywood studio
executive during World War
II. She
worked for nearly a decade on Daughters
of the Dust. The film depicts a pivotal
moment when descendants of black
slaves decide to leave the Sea Islands for
the north. The characters are poised
between old and new, between memories
of their African ancestors and the values
of the new world. Dash conveys their
division and reconciliation with dream-
like, magical images, shifts in the tempo
of movement, and close attention to cul-
tural details such as language and
cuisine.
"1 can't really say
it's like any
other film that I've ever seen," Dash has
commented, "but
I knew that
it had to
exist."

Atom Egoyan
After years of assisting co-productions of Hollywood genre films,
Canada's public film agencies helped to support independent and
alternative cinema
in the 1980s. Atom Egoyan (b. 1960,
in Egypt)
was among those who emerged under the aegis of funding from
the Ontario Film Development Corp. and other government
sources. His feature narratives— including Next of Kin (1984),
Family Viewing (1987), Speaking Parts (1989), and The Adjuster
(1991
)— revived alternative cinema's concern with looking and
being looked at,
in a mise-en-scene where modern electronic
communications, from home video to visual teleconferencing,
have attenuated face-to-face relationships. Meanwhile, some
characters struggle to retain artifacts and memories of their ethnic
heritage.

ALTERNATIVE NONFICTION
Among the convergences of cinema practices after the 1970s, one
of the most interesting was a movement within nonfiction film-
making toward the avant-garde. The two kinds of filmmaking had
been linked in the past,
in such works as Ruttmann's 1927 film
Berlin: Symphony of a Great City (see Chapter 11 ). But in the
1960s, with the ascendancy of cinema verite style and the grow-
ing importance of television in financing documentary films, a
rhetoric of "truth" and an ethic of journalistic "objectivity" domi-
nated the nonfiction field. By the 1980s, however, cinema verite
had largely faded as a movement, remaining as a stylistic marker
denoting "documentary authenticity"
in fiction films such as Born
in Flames.
Its legacy in criticism and theory was to open the
debate in nonfiction film about looking and being looked at thai
was taking place more generally in alternative filmmaking
(although, as we have seen, Shirley Clarke had raised the issue as
early as 1961
in The Connection). A few nonfiction filmmakers
explored further the implications of an aesthetic
in which "truth"
and "objectivity" gave way to indeterminacy and subjectivity.
23.22. A scene from Chris
Marker's "film essay, "Sans soleil
(Sunless,
1982), an experiment
in nonfiction form
Chris Marker
For Chris Marker these developments represented not conver-
gence but continuity. Though often discussed as a participant in
the cinema verite movement. Marker had always been no less
close to the avant-garde, as we have seen
in discussing films such
as Letter from Siberia and La Jetee (see Chapter 19). Another of
his works that became a touchstone for formal experimentation
in
the nonfiction form was the 1982 film Sans soleil [Sunless; on
screen the title appears in three languages: Russian, English, and
French). This has been called a "film essay," as adequate or inade-
quate a name as any for a film of which one critic has written,
"the only possible synopsis for Sans soleil would be, as though in
a Borges story, the film itself (and even this would be inade-
quate)."'' Sans soleil consists of a series of interspersed images,
largely scenes from daily
life in )apan, along with sequences shot
in Africa and Iceland, and a segment analyzing Alfred
Hitchcock's Vertigo through stills and shots of the film's San
Francisco locations. On the soundtrack, along with music and
electronic sounds, a woman's voice reads from what are said to
495

be letters from a photographer. The work can also be described as
a meditation, one that leaves room tor the spectator to connect
with his or her own meditations on the many topics which the
film evokes.
First-Person Documentary
Another way nonfiction filmmakers found to move away from
claims of truth and objectivity was to make themselves the center
of their film, with all their prejudices and obsessions— in short,
their subjectivity— on display. Sometimes such works were pre-
sented as salvage jobs, substitutes for conventional documentaries
the filmmakers intended but failed to make. The completed film
would probe the professional and personal problems that pre-
vented the original project from getting made. (Meanwhile, the
spectator would hope that the work on screen would illuminate
themes of greater depth than the filmmaker's self-involvement.)
Roger d^ Me
One independently made nonfiction work, Roger & Me (1989),
linked
its filmmaker's self-involvement with larger issues so suc-
cessfully that a major Hollywood studio purchased the rights to
distribute
it. The filmmaker, Michael Moore (b. 1954), who intro-
duces himself on screen through childhood home movies, was an
unemployed journalist from the city of Flint, Michigan, which had
suffered economic difficulties following the closing of automobile
factories there. Moore's unsuccessful efforts to interview Roger
Smith, then chairman of the General Motors Corp., serve as a
frame for the filmmaker's views on American politics and society.
By presenting himself as a clownish figure in a baseball cap, run-
ning shoes, and battered winter coat, Moore provokes laughs that
sugarcoat the film's political polemic. Some critics complained
that the film dispensed with objective journalistic standards (as in
shifting the temporal order of events), raising again the question of
the nonfiction filmmaker's obligations to "truth."
Errol Morris
A radical approach to this issue was taken by filmmaker Errol
Morris (b. 1948), who frequently expressed the view that cinema
verite had set documentary film back forty years. Morris was
known among followers of nonfiction film for an idiosyncratic
work concerning pet cemeteries, Cafes of Heaven (1978), and
another on a small town, Venice, Florida (1981
), before he gained
national attention
in the United States for The Thin Blue Line
(1988). The film, which aided in securing the release of a man
convicted of murdering a policeman in Dallas, Texas, explores the
1976 events through interviews with the convicted man, his com-
panion on the night of the murder, witnesses, and public officials.
But
its innovative and controversial segments involve reconstruct-
ing events in a highly stylized mise-en-scene with performers
enacting the roles of actual persons, accompanied by a minimalist
musical score by composer Philip Glass. These scenes demon-
strate with minute attention to detail the portentous significance
of slight variations in supposed eyewitness accounts.
The Thin Blue Line straddles a contradiction, aiming at aes-
thetic and practical goals that may seem at odds.
It postulates the
indeterminacy of "truth" on film and in human memory, while
asserting within the framework of legal "truth" that a man was
unjustly convicted for a crime he did not commit.
Its success in
both areas made
it one of the most provocative nonfiction films of
its era.

Thej^uration of
^
In their horror and moral complexity, the
events of World War
II have drawn
extraordinary efforts from nonfiction film-
makers to document and comprehend
them. Filmmakers have shown an excep-
tional need for duration in recording their
search for witnesses and traces, their
interviews and sometimes confrontations
with people whose memories of war are
often clouded by evasion, justification, or
pain. The Sorrow and the Pity (1969),
Marcel Ophuis's film on the French town
of Clermont-Ferrand during World War
II,
ran four and one-half hours (see Chapter
19); more recently German filmmaker
Heike Sander has made a three-and-one-
half-hour film on German women raped
by Russian soldiers at the end of the
war and the children born from those
encounters, Betreier und Befreite /
Krieg-Verwaltigungen-Kinder (Liberators
Take Liberties— War, Rapes and Children,
1992).
One of the longest nonfiction films ever
made— certainly the longest to receive
commercial distribution— is Shoah
("Annihilation," 1985), a work by French
filmmaker Claude Lanzmann (b. 1925) on
the subject of Nazi extermination camps
in Poland during World War
II. Part
I runs
four hours, thirty-four minutes. Part
II four
hours, fifty-two minutes, for a total of
nine hours, twenty-six minutes. The film-
maker has spoken of the film not as a
documentary or as a historical work but
as an allegory, implying that the Nazi
extermination policies of World War
II,
rather than being a historical aberration
or an event fixed firmly
in the past, are
part of a continuum extending into the
present. Nevertheless, the film's tech-
niques are generally similar to those of
Ophuls, Sander, and other documentary
filmmakers, utilizing interviews and a
search for historical traces.
Its uniqueness
lies in
its duration,
its slow, repetitious
compiling of detail and evidence to make
the case that extermination was a deliber-
ate policy, that many people knew of
it,
that the hiolocaust did happen.
hoah
How
is one to evaluate such a film— as
film? Many critics praised Shoah, but few
analyzed
it. There was surprise and dis-
quiet when critic Pauline Kael offered "a
dissenting view." "I found Shoah logy and
exhausting right from the start," she
wrote; "sitting in a theatre seat for a film
as full of dead spaces as this one seems
to me a form of self-punishment."
journalist and historian Timothy Garton
Ash put the issue in another light: "This
deadly repetition, this exhaustion, this
having to sit through
it,
is an essential
part of Lanzmann's creation. He deiibc
ately uses the dictatorial powers of the
director to lock you in a cattle wagon and
send you for nine and a half hours down
the line to Auschwitz." According to critic
J. Hoberman, "The essential question
here
is one of identification. ... In
its
structure Shoah encourages the viewer to
identify with the victims." The spectator's
pain and exhaustion, Hoberman suggests,
is a deliberate outcome of Lanzmann's
"formal intelligence."

Filmmaker Rosa von
Praunheim (left) and Dieter
Dicken (second from left) portray
gay entrepreneurs who downplay
the threat of AIDS because of
possible adverse effects to their
business, a sauna club, in von
Praunheim's Ein Virus kennt keine
Moral (A Virus Knows No Morals,
1989).
GAY AND LESBIAN CINEMA
Changing mores in North America and Europe in the 1970s made
more visible the lives and culture of homosexual men and
women, and the AIDS epidemic beginning in the 1980s brought
to society and cinema an explicitness about sexual behavior that
had hitherto been unrepresented. The development of gay cinema
largely followed this public trajectory, moving from the works of
filmmakers such as Kenneth Anger and Andy Warhol to an exten-
sive and varied film practice that ranged from independent
narrative features to avant-garde works.
Rosa von Praunheim
A filmmaker whose works spanned the decades after 1970 with a
highly individual style was the West German Rosa von
Praunheim, who was born Holger Mischwitzki
in Riga, Latvia (b.
1942). Making films in both Berlin and New York, von Praunheim
adopted from the beginning of his career a confrontational
approach, offering
little comfort to spectators of any persuasion
and explicitly disavowing inspirational and optimistic treatments
of gay
life. In the 1980s he made a series of films concerning
AIDS that, like his earlier works on homosexuality, aimed to pro-
voke outrage and spectator response.
Ein Virus kennt keine Moral (A Virus Knov\/s No Morals, 1989)
took the form of grim satire. Many reactions to the AIDS crisis are
held up to ridicule, including those of the medical profession, the
press, politicians, psychotherapists, and even those of gays
themselves (von Praunheim portrays a gay entrepreneur who
denigrates the AIDS threat because he runs a profitable sauna
club). The film ends in bitter farce as AIDS sufferers are shipped
off to the island of Helgoland (renamed Hellgayland) and a mili-
tant army of the sick kidnaps a politician.
Isaac Julien
A film that brought together many of the trends in alternative cin-
ema during the 1980s was Looking for Langston (1989), by black
British filmmaker Isaac Julien (b. 1960). As a member of the
Sankofa workshop in Britain, Julien had worked on nonfiction
films whose aim was to establish blacks as subjects in cinema
as people who looked, both from behind the camera and on
screen, rather than only being looked at.
Though Looking for Langston may have been launched as a
nonfiction project about the black American poet Langston
Hughes (1902-1967), Julien ended up by shaping the work as an
aesthetic amalgam— at once documentary and fiction, gay cin-
ema, black cinema, narrative, and avant-garde. Juxtaposing
historical actuality footage with a highly stylized mise-en-scene,
the forty-six-minute black-and-white film
is a work of contempla-
tive and troubled exploration, suggesting that race, sexual
preference, and desire are subjects that are difficult to categorize
in simple, programmatic ways.
Lesbian Filmmaking
Works by women in the lesbian independent cinema have
reached general audiences less often than works by von
Praunheim, Julien, and other gay male filmmakers,
in part
because many women's films have been addressed to issues of
identity and spectatorship within their own community. A film
concerning a romantic relationship between two women that
498

gained commercial distribution, Desert Hearts (1985), directed by
Donna Deitch (b. 1945), seemed to some critics more closely
linked to Hollywood narrative conventions than to lesbian film or
cultural practice. New German Cinema (see Chapter 21
), with
its
more fluid relations between narrative and avant-garde styles, and
state television subsidies for subcultural works, perhaps more
clearly offered a place for lesbian filmmaking within art cinema.
In that context. West German filmmaker Ulrike Ottinger (b.
1942) became a significant figure with works such as Madame X:
Eine absolute Herrscherin (Madame X: An Absolute Ruler, 1977),
an adventure fantasy concerning a group of women who heed a
call offering "gold, love, and adventure" and join pirate queen
Madame X on her voyages. Another West German filmmaker,
Monika Treut (b. 1954), brought a spirit of adventure back to the
community in Die jungfraueri Maschine (The Virgin Machine,
1988^, a comic film
in which a German woman journalist enters
the lesbian culture of San Francisco.

TWENTY-FOUR
HE GLOBAL
OF
Cinema at the end of the twentieth century and
its own first cen-
tury presents a choice of perspectives.
If you choose to observe
the medium from a certain angle you are likely to emphasize
Hollywood's resurgence—the worldwide domination of block-
buster movies, the penetration by entertainment conventions into
indigenous cultures in the globe's most remote corners.
If you
shift the viewpoint you might notice, on the contrary, a further
spread of cinematic activity, a rising to respect and recognition of
filmmakers whose nations of origin had rarely before appeared on
the motion picture map. With a
little dexterity you could keep
both angles in view at once, and see that the situation remained
what
it had been for several generations, of interpenetration,
dialogue, and struggle. On one side stand the metropolitan
cinemas, those of Hollywood and Europe, not just profiting but
also assisting and absorbing. On the other stand countries on the
periphery, not necessarily new to cinema but to the international
film marketplace, and filmmakers with new visions facing old
temptations.
For the North American spectator, however, one perspective
is
unequivocal; world cinema
is no longer confined to classrooms
and museums. Films from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Spain
became box office successes in the United States during the
1980s, expanding the experience of overseas filmmaking beyond
the traditional purveyors of foreign art films, France,
Italy, and the
Scandinavian countries. Films from Asia, Africa, and Latin
America were screened on public and cable television and
became available on video cassettes. Widening the horizon of the
North American filmgoer may be a very small step in the larger
picture, yet
it was
still a critical ingredient in the development of a
sophisticated and open view of world filmmaking. People of dif-
ferent national, ethnic, and racial backgrounds were not only
being spoken for and spoken to in cinema, they were speaking in
their own voices, creating their own images— and being seen and
heard.
AUSTRALIAN CINEMA
To choose Australia as a case study to begin a consideration of
late-twentieth-century world cinema may appear unrepresenta-
tive, since that English-speaking country exhibited national, but
not ethnic or racial, characteristics different from the mainstream.
Like Britain
in the 1960s, however, Australia vividly exemplified
the dilemmas of national cinema in the 1980s and beyond.
Australia's achievement in shaping a viable national cinema from
the ground up raised the same questions that British cinema had
faced two decades earlier, and that other cinema movements
500

would confront as they emerged into the international arena: what
kind of success were they aiming at, and where?
Australia,
it could be argued, had been poorer in cinema than
many countries. With
its theaters dominated by United States and
British films, the country produced only a few sound films before
World War
II and barely any in the quarter century after the war.
Finally,
in 1970,
in recognition of cinema's role in national cul-
tural expression and identity,
it set up a government organization,
the Australian Film Development Corp. (later renamed the
Australian Film Commission) to finance domestic filmmaking. The
results were impressive: over one hundred feature films produced
in the 1970s, and by the end of the decade Australian filmmakers
received international recognition
in the form of Hollywood
Academy Award nominations. My Brilliant Career (1979) was
nominated for costume design and Breaker Morant (^980) for
screenplav.
History and Culture
My Brilliant Career, directed by Gillian Armstrong (b. 1950), and
Breaker Morant, directed by Bruce Beresford (b. 1940), were in
certain ways exemplary models for an emergent national cinema

Sybylla Melvyn (Judy
Davis) playing with her
beau Harry Beecham (Sam
Neill) in My Brilliant Career
(1979), directed by Gillian
Armstrong, one of the films
that gained Australian cin-
ema international
recognition. The heroine
turns down her suitor to
pursue a literary career
of the twentieth century when Australia's nationhood was being
formed, and both offered historical insights with contemporary
resonance. My Brilliant Career, directed by a woman and drawn
from a 1901 novel by a young woman writer in which the heroine
chooses her artistic vocation over romance and a respectable
marriage, addressed feminist concerns. Breaker Morant was based
on an actual incident in the Boer War, fought in South Africa,
in
which three Australian men serving in the British Army were con-
victed and executed, so the film asserts, more for geopolitical
reasons than for the war crimes of which they were accused.
Besides
its specifically Australian connotations, the film dealt
broadly with questions of imperialism and the sacrifice of individ-
uals in the name of state power.
These historical dramas were also markers of historical change
in international film culture. The new or resurgent national cine-
mas of the 1960s had offered gritty realism, as in the case of
British cinema, or trenchant treatments of contemporary society,
as in the French, Brazilian, or Japanese new waves. By 1980,
however, nearly all the films made outside the United States that
were successful
in the international market were from two genres:
period works like My Brilliant Career and Breaker Morant, or con-
temporarv comedies. This flight from contemporary realism held
true in Australian cinema for domestic audiences as well. Social
issues were most effectively raised in genre format— in the
apocalyptic futurist dystopias Mad Max (1979) and Mad Max II:
The Road Wamor (1981
), directed by George Miller (b. 1945),
or occult thrillers Picnic at Hanging Rock 0975) and The Last
Wave (1977) by director Peter Weir (b. 1944), which dealt with
relations between Euro-Australians and the country's Aboriginal
people.
''Mid-Pacific'' Cinema
With new visions did indeed come old temptations. By the early
1980s a substantial number of Australian filmmakers had
decamped to Hollywood. Armstrong, Beresford, Miller, and Weir
all began directing in the United States, along with Fred Schepisi
(b. 1939), who had made an important period film on Aboriginal
themes. The Chant ofjimmie Blacksmith (1978). Performers Mel
Gibson (b. 1956) from Mad Max and Mad Max
II, Judy Davis (b.
1956) from My Brilliant Career, and Br\'an Brown (b. 19471 from
Breaker Morant, among others, also made the leap to Hollywood.
Though several of these figures continued to work in both coun-
tries, one heard
little of "Mid-Pacific" cinema in the same manner
as twenty years earlier, when the term "Mid-Atlantic" was coined
to describe the films made in Hollywood by British filmmakers or
in Britain by Hollywood studios. The Pacific was wider than the

Atlantic and Australian culture less familiar (or marketable) than

its intense moment of international recognition,
Australian cinema lost through the defection of its leading film-
makers
its clear delineation as a national cinema: henceforward
its achievements would be regarded as individual rather than
national.
CINEMA OF THE
"THREE CHINAS"
Following Australia's revival of the 1970s, the most significant film
movement of the next decade came from Chinese cinema— not
only from mainland China but also from the film industries of
Hong Kong and Taiwan. These were designated the "three
Chinas" to demarcate the cultural and political differences that
underlay each cinematic practice: China, a socialist country after
1949; Hong Kong, a British colony on the Chinese coast, sched-
uled to become part of China in 1997; Taiwan, an off-shore island
ruled by Nationalist exiles from China since the 1940s. (Some
even spoke of "four Chinas" to include Chinese-American cinema
exemplified by filmmakers such as Wayne Wang.) By the 1990s,
however, there were signs of convergence and collaboration
among these disparate cinemas.
China
Around 1970, filmmaking was as negligible in China as in
Australia, though for wholly different reasons. After the "Cultural
Revolution" instigated by Chinese Communist Party chairman
Mao Zedong had completely shut down the film studios from
1967 to 1969 (see Chapter 18), production gradually resumed
in
the 1970s, but the cultural role of cinema remained uncertain. As
television ownership became more widespread after the early
1980s, motion picture attendance began to drop. Chinese film-
makers sought to retain their audience with an amalgam of
ideology and popular genres: biopics on national heroes, films
about hardship and injustice in the era before Communism, works
on the World War
II struggle against the Japanese (often with
added kung fu action). Veteran director Xie Jin used the conven-
tions of family melodrama for a more critical view of the recent
past in Furong Zhen (Hibiscus Town, 1986), a film that became
controversial because
it traced how families in a rural village suf-
fered over the years (particularly during the Cultural Revolution)
from the excesses of Communist political dogma.
THE FIFTH GENERATION. The most significant develop-
ment for Chinese cinema came with the reopening of the Beijing
Film Academy in 1978, after more than a decade of inactivity.
Many in the entering class, though from privileged backgrounds,
had spent their teen years and early twenties as farm or factory
workers, or even as militant Red Guards during the Cultural
Revolution. As filmmakers they wanted to overthrow what they
regarded as Chinese film's moribund narrative and stylistic formu-
las. Graduating in 1982, their group became known as the "Fifth
Generation" of Chinese filmmakers.
Though film authorship
is generally ascribed to the director.
Fifth Generation collaborations complicate that notion in the case
of Chinese film. Academy graduates worked together in different

roles to create a new visual style for Chinese cinema: a mise-en-
scene of open landscape and the colors of land and sky,
in place
of what they saw as artificial studio interiors in conventional
Chinese film style. Chen Kaige (b. 1952) directed Huang Tudi
(Yellow Earth, 1984), the first Fifth Generation film to gain interna-
tional attention, and Da Yuebing(The Big Parade, 1986), using
Beijing classmate Zhang Yimou (b. 1950) as cinematographer on
both films. Zhang became a director with Hong Gaoling (Red
Sorghum, 1987), using another classmate, Cu Changwei
(b. 1957)
as cinematographer. Gu Changwei also shot Chen Kaige's Haizi
Wang (King of the Children, 1987).
Though Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou worked together and
with common collaborators, their styles differed. Chen's films are
reminiscent of a filmmaker such as Hungary's Miklos Jancso,
using a moving camera, long shots, and long takes to focus on
group activities in open spaces; Zhang's Red Sorghum and later
works are more melodramatic, treating the social context of pri-
vate lives with a rich visual palette of bright colors. But with
others of their generation, they shared a common purpose: to
leave behind the political abstractions and symbolism of earlier
Chinese filmmakers and depict the workings of politics and ideol-
ogy at a more human level. They wanted to put on film the daily
life they had observed in the countryside during the Cultural
Revolution. Yellow Earth and Red Sorghum are emblematic as
titles: both are set in rural China during the 1930s. Chen Kaige's
The Big Parade depicts the arduous efforts of a military squad
training to march
in the annual national day parade in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square. King of the Children concerns a young
man assigned to teach
in a rural school during the Cultural
Revolution.
As Fifth Generation films began to win admirers at overseas fes-
tivals beginning in 1987— a major breakthrough came when Red
Sorghum won the top prize at the Berlin film festival
in 1988
they came under strong criticism
in China. These works were
regarded as insufficiently respectful of official dogma, at the least.
Their aesthetic concern for visual and narrative subtlety was
treated as elitism, overly sophisticated for the dwindling mass
audience. Chinese critics thus repeated the debates about socialist
filmmaking that had begun
in the Soviet Union
in the 1920s:
Should films be propaganda or art? Should they please the masses
or impress the world? By the late 1980s the leading Fifth

Generation directors were facing choices similar to those that
confronted many filmmakers in many countries over the decades:
stay at home with inadequate funding, carping criticism, and
possible censorship, or go abroad, where financing and critical
respect were available (but one's work might lose the cultural
detail and national specificity that had made
it significant in the
first place). These deliberations were placed
in a tragic context
with the so-called Beijing massacre of June 4, 1989, when the
Chinese army crushed the student and workers' movements for
democracy that had broken out throughout China during the
spring. The policies of cultural liberalization that had permitted
students to speak out for political reform had also allowed the
Fifth Generation to flourish, and after June 4 more stringent con-
trols over expression were restored.

WU TIANMINC. One of the most important figures in Chinese
film, Wu Tianming (b. 1939), head of the Xi'an film studio in cen-
tral China, was in the United States on June 4 and spoke out
against the military crackdown. He refused to return to China and
settled in Southern California, where he worked on several film
projects that have not yet been produced. Originally an actor, Wu
began directing films in the 1980s and made one of China's major
works of the decade, Lao Jing
{ The Old Well, 1986), with Zhang
Yimou as a cocinematographer and also a lead performer. Elected
studio administrator by a vote of workers, Wu Tianming brought
Fifth Generation filmmakers to Xi'an by encouraging their projects
(such as Red Sorghum and King of the Children) after other stu-
dios had discouraged or tried to interfere with their previous work.
In addition to Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, Wu Tianming
supported another of their Beijing classmates, director Tian
Zhuangzhuang (b. 1952), in the production of a controversial
work, Daoma Zei (Horse Thief, 1986). International critics
admired
its meditative beauty and ethnographic freshness, while
in China the film was attacked for
its lack of conventional narra-
tive continuity and
its focus on Tibetan Buddhist religious
practices that had been officially suppressed.
CO-PRODUCTIONS. Despite changes in the cultural climate
and the film industry after 1989, Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige
were able to continue making films in China because their inter-
national reputations enabled them to attract foreign funding.

Bian Zou Bian Chang {Life on a String, 1991
) with production
support from British and German sources. All three films were
visually striking, though they lack the political resonances that
energized the filmmakers' earlier work. Zhang Yimou made an
effort to reconnect with Chinese audiences with Qiu Ju Da
Cuansi (The Story ofQiuJu, 1992), a film set in contemporary
rural China concerning a farm woman's struggles with bureau-
cracy, shot in a realistic style (though retaining the director's
characteristic rich color) and using mainly nonprofessional
performers.
Taiwan and Hou Hsiao-hsien
A name appears as an executive producer on Raise the Red
Lantern that might have startled any spectator who recognized
it:
Hou Hsiao-hsien (b. 1947), better known not as a producer but as
Taiwan's most important director of the 1980s. What was this film
director from Taiwan doing on a Hong Kong/China co-production?
The answer lies in the murky territory where cinema meets poli-
tics. The production company was not from Hong Kong but from
Taiwan, though a Hong Kong entity was nominally listed so that
the film did not appear to breach the official enmity between
China and Taiwan. Cinema was pioneering in collaboration where
politics still openly feared to tread.
Along with Edward Yang [Yang Dechang]'
(b. 1947), Hou
Hsiao-hsien launched Taiwan's "new wave"
in the early 1980s,
developing cinema as art and social commentary in a
setting dominated by commercial martial arts films and costume
melodramas. Working under constraints of government censor-
ship, Hou Hsiao-hsien forged an oblique, contemplative style
built around deep-focus cinematography, focusing on intimate
details of family
life and subtle distinctions of class, generation,
and language. Among his significant works were Tongnian
Wangshi (The Time to Live and the Time to Die, 1985), Lainlian
Feng Chen {Dust in the Wind, 1986), and Niluohe Nuer
{Daughter of the Nile, 1987). When restrictions on dealing with
Taiwan's history were eased following the death
in 1988 of
Chiang Ching-Kuo, son of the founder of Nationalist rule on the
island, Hou made one of his most challenging works, Beiqing
Chengshi {A City of Sadness, 1989), dealing with the era after
1945 when the native Taiwanese people passed from being domi-
nated by the Japanese, who had ruled the island as a colony since
1895, to being dominated by the Nationalist Chinese from the
mainland. Edward Yang, who studied filmmaking at the University
of Southern California and works in a more melodramatic style,
has made films about contemporary urban
life such as Quingmei
Zhuma {Taipei Story, 1985) and Kongbufenzi {The Terrorizer,
1986).
Hong Kong
Hong Kong's film industry had centered on commercial martial
arts and genre movies until young filmmakers inaugurated a "new
wave" in the 1980s. More closely tied to commercial filmmaking
than was the case with
its counterparts in Taiwan and mainland
China, Hong Kong's new generation gained international atten-
tion through stylish treatments of familiar themes. Works that
were produced as popular entertainment for the Asian market
such as Yanzhi Kou {Rouge, 1987), a sumptuous ghost story that
moves between Hong Kong in the 1930s and 1980s, directed by
Stanley Kwan [Cuan Jinpang]
(b. 1957)— attracted art cinema
audiences in other countries for their vivid production design,
sensational narratives, and often incisive social commentary. John
Woo [Wu Yusen]
(b. 1948), who began directing action pictures
in his twenties, made an international success with his eighteenth
film, Diexue Shaung Xiong{The Killer, 1989), a violent but also
self- reflexive underworld melodrama. Woman director Ann Hui
|Xu Anhual
(b. 1947) became widely known with a film depicting
brutal treatment of people attempting to escape from Vietnam,
Touben Nuhai {Boat People, 1982), that was controversial
because Hong Kong was frequently the destination of Vietnamese
refugees. She moved the Hong Kong new wave toward a more
personal cinema with an autobiographical work, Haktou Tsauhan
{Song of the Exile, 1989), concerning a woman with a Chinese
father and a Japanese mother.

THE END OF SOVIET CINEMA
The Soviet Union ceased to exist as a political entit\ following the
failure of an attempted coup in August 1991
; shortly thereafter
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev gave up his pest, and with him
into the proverbial dustbin of history went the policies and con-
cepts that had animated the world during the 1980s as Gorbachev
sought to overcome his country's difficulties through glasnost, or
reform. With the former Soviet Union divided into some fifteen
separate republics, most of them attempting to transform state-
supported economies, the status of film production, along with
many other enterprises, was in question. What
is clear
is that 1991
marks an end point, and film historians were only beginning to
assess the impact of g/asnosf on cinema when Soviet film, as
it
had been know n for seven decades, disappeared with the state
that had supported
it.
''Shelved'' Films
The brief history of "glasnost cinema" was epitomized by an
episode at the 1987 Moscow film festival, when director
Alexander Askoldov ib. 1932
1 publicly requested that his first film,
made two decades earlier but never released, be shown at the
festival.
It was, and Askoldov's KowissanThe Commissar, 1967)
became an international success and a svmbol of the Soviet
Union's suppressed cinema.
"Shelved" was the film world's term for films completed but
placed on a shelf in a vault, rather than screened for audiences.
"There had been no reason for shelving them except bureaucratic
caution," wrote a Soviet film historian in a sentence through
which the entire historv of a cinema,
if not of a nation, might be
read." There were reasons aplenty, once the censors determined
that a film contained material contrary to official viewpoints— on
religion, for example, or on ethnicity, morality-, or even editing or
camera work, dn The Commissar, set in 1920 during Russia's civil
war, the censors objected to a sequence in which a character has
a prevision of the Holocaust; when the director refused to cut
it,
the film was shelved.
i
After Askoldov's public plea, a number of films were released
that had been made in the 1960s and 1970s and shelved for a
decade or more. Woman director Kira Muratova ib. 1934i gained
distribution for two works, Korotkiye vstrechi (Brief Encounters,
1968) and Dolgive provodv
i The Long Farewell, 1971
1 that had
been banned because their representation of relations between
men and women was regarded as too gloomy. When she returned
to filmmaking in the glasnost era and caused controversv with
Astenicheskii sindrom
( The Weakness Syndrome. 1989i, which
used profanity and displayed male frontal nudity, the film was
nevertheless released. "Once the censored shelf was emptied,"
write film historians Andrew Horton and Michael Brashinskv, "no
new shelf for glasnost films could be created."^
Rejpentance
Earlier in the glasnost era, important films were still subjected to
delaying tactics on the part of authorities. This was the case with
another controversial work, Monanieba {Repentance), made in
1984 b\ the Georgian director Tenghiz Abuladze (b. 1924) but not
released until 1986.

gives the cold shoulder to her

(Andrei Fomin) in one of the most
sexually candid of Soviet glasnost
films, Malenkaya Vera CLittle Vera,
1988), directed by Vasily Pichul.
Repentance marked the first direct effort by a Soviet filmmaker
to depict the workings of a totalitarian dictatorship within the
Soviet Union
itself. "Immense press coverage, a flow of letters
from the moviegoers, heated debates, tears, blessings, and rejoic-
ing on the best part of the public and the stubborn opposition and
ill-feeling of a minority adhering to the principle, 'Let the sleeping
dogs
lie,' " greeted the film's release in the U.S.S.R., according to
film historian Neya Zorkaya/ The film shapes
its treatment of the
past through surreal comedy and a narrative structure involving
trial testimony, flashbacks, and dreams. The dictator, the mayor of
a town
in the Soviet state of Georgia,
is an all-purpose figure
resembling Hitler and Mussolini as well as the Soviet Union's own
Joseph Stalin. He sings opera arias to his victims, and his police
are spear-carrying knights in armor who greet people they are
about to arrest by saying, "Peace unto this house." Yet the work's
generality and narrative subjectivity do not mitigate
its grim per-
spective on the Stalin era, particularly through the ideological
double-think that clothes terror in platitudes such as (in the
English-language subtitles), "That which serves the common good
is moral," and, "I'm only fulfilling the will of the people."
Little Vera
Prohibitions on dealing with ideology and history were not the
only taboos Soviet filmmakers sought to transgress in the 1980s.
Depicting sexuality was also a goal of the new openness. The
most prominent work to explore this theme was Malenkaya Vera
(Little Vera, 1988), directed by Vasily Pichul
(b. 1961
). The film
was promoted for
its candor in presenting nudity and sexual
relations, yet
it
is equally as revealing for
its social realism,
its
portrayal of a far from Utopian Soviet society of bleak industrial
landscapes and disfunctional family
life marked by alcoholism
and violence.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, an era of socialist aes-
thetics and aspirations in cinema, one of the most significant
shaping forces on the medium, had come to an end
in the place
of its origin (though continuing in various forms in China, Cuba,
and elsewhere). What was ahead for cinema in Russia, Ukraine,
and other former republics of the U.S.S.R.? Hollywood films were
popular in theaters, and entrepreneurs set up "videotheques" to
celebrate the new freedom by showing "erotic" films on video-
tape. Speaking of the situation
in Russia, Vasily Pichul told an
interviewer that unless filmmakers can meet these different
challenges, "we'll go under and we'll be reduced to making
advertisements, pop promos or television programs. There's every
chance that Russian cinema can become an important part of the
cultural
life of the country. That possibility exists, and
if we don't
make use of
it, we'll lose
it."""
INTERNATIONAL
ART CINEMA
With the decline of the socialist model, the strongest remaining
alternative to the Hollywood style of narrative fiction filmmaking
was international art cinema. Supported largely through co-
production by a combination of private capital, governments, and
television networks, by the 1980s this film practice had become
almost a broad-based genre in
itself. Though there were impor-
tant exceptions (to be noted), international art cinema took on a
classic quality, drawing on history and literature for
its sources,
with a high level of visual polish and
little in the way of aesthetic
innovation.
It occupied a third position in the global structure of
mainstream cinema, with Hollywood on one side and various
national film industries, producing popular narratives for domestic
audiences, on the other.
Satyajit Ray and Akira Kurosawa, both of whom had been char-
ter members, so to speak, of international art cinema when
it
formed
in the 1950s, continued working into the 1980s (and
in
Kurosawa's case, the 1990s). During the 1980s new filmmakers
from Japan, North America, and Europe became part of the
movement, as well as from countries not previously associated

"For writers of history text-books," mili-
tary historian Michael Howard has stated,
"1989-1990 will mark a caesura as defin-
itive as those of 1814-15, 1918-19, or
1945." For writers (and readers) of film
history textbooks, the questions that fol-
low the dramatic historical break caused
by the collapse of Communist regimes in
the former Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe are: what happens next in film
production, and who will pay for
it?
One answer came for Romanian direc-
tor Lucian Pintilie (b. 1933) when he
attended a conference organized by the
French Ministry of Culture in 1990 on the
subject of post-Communist cinema in
Eastern Europe. The French government
and private French companies expressed
willingness to finance co-productions,
and Pintilie was offered a grant to make a
film.
"I was speechless," he later told an
interviewer.
Well he might have been. Pintilie had
not made a film for more than a decade.

country's Communist dictatorship, Nela
encounters a polluted land and a morally
indifferent people.
As a young director he had shown excep-
tional ability with his first two films,
Duminica la ora 6 {Sunday at 6, 1965)
and Rccunstituirca (Reconstruction,
1969), the latter of which Mira Liehm and
Antonin
J. Leihm, authors of The Most
Important Art: East European Film After
1945, describe as "the best film to
emerge from Romania during the sixties,
indeed one of the pinnacles of European
cinema during that decade." But his work
was banned or delayed from release, and
in the early 1970s he was sent into exile;
in the 1970s and 1980s he directed plays
for theaters in France and the United
States.
Following the overthrow of the regime
of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
in 1989, Pintilie returned to his homeland
as director of the Cinema Creation Studio
of the Ministry of Romanian Culture.
With his French funding, he said,
"1 took
advantage of these exalted and confused
times, which were the aftermath of the
revolution, to start production immedi-
ately." The result was Le Chene {The Oak,
1992), a film that was shot in Romania
with postproduction work done in
France.
It played at festivals in France and
the United States and was released com-
mercially in the U.S.
in 1993.
The Oak
is set in 1988,
in the next to
last year of the Ceausescu dictatorship.

been a member of the Securitate (secret
police), a young woman carries his ashes

in a journey marked

country polluted morally and physically,

ence. The film's tone
is angry, but
its style
is surreal tragicomedy.
It marks an
assured and impressive beginning for a
possible new era in cinema.
"Co-production
is the only means of
survival for our cinema," Pintilie has said,
"because no matter how high the costs in
Romania, workers can
still be found for
very cheap. Let's take advantage of our
misery. We can
still produce important
films for not a lot of money.
If we do not
understand this,
in two years at most, our
cinema will close shop."

Ray's career in the context of Indian cinema marks a vivid case in
point, and the title of his 1984 film, Ghare-Baire {The Home and
the World), seems to symbolize the two poles of Indian filmmak-
ing.
In the 1980s India produced by far the largest number of films
of any country— nearly one thousand annually.
In the genre
tradition established
in the 1930s, many were highly codified
music-dramas featuring enormously popular stars. Avidly
attended by Indian audiences, these works were seen elsewhere
in Asia and Africa but rarely by non-Indians in North America or
Europe. Ray was the only Indian filmmaker widely known to
international art cinema audiences. His most familiar work
still
remained his earliest, the Apu trilogy (see Chapter 15) and other
films made between 1955 and 1960, when he was an exciting fig-
ure in the art cinema movement then just emerging.
The Home and the World wa-i, Ray's twenty-sixth feature in a
thirty-year career to that point. Funded by the National Film
Development Corporation of India, a government body,
it became
one of the director's most popular films.
It was based on a novel
by Indian writer Rabindraneth Tagore concerning a love triangle
amid political struggles in early twentieth century Bengal. With
subtle color cinematography enhancing
its period mise-en-scene,
the film depicts a clash between two kinds of nationalism, one
presented as narrow and divisive, the other as cosmopolitan and
humane.
It
is not difficult to see the work also as a parable about
two kinds of filmmaking, one for home, one for the world.
Akira Kurosawa
Kurosawa
in Japan was
in a similar position, though by the 1980s
Japan's movie audience had been heavily depleted by competi-
tion from television. More than a decade Ray's senior, Kurosawa
became the medium's ranking elder in the 1980s as had been
Buiiuel
in the previous decade and figures such as Ford and
Hitchcock in the 1960s. Nevertheless, Kurosawa found
it almost

impossible to raise monev for his projects within his own country.
"It was difficult for outsiders to understand why Japan's foremost
director was not working," film historian Audie Bock has written.
"The basic reason was that the Japanese film industry had entered
a decline in the late 1960's and the budget for a Kurosawa film
was no longer affordable."''
This judgment seemed borne out when Kurosawa's
Dodesukaden (1970), running more than four hours, became his
first film to lose money at the box office. Discouraged and beset
by illness, the director attempted suicide in 1971. His film career
was ultimately rescued by overseas financing. Dersu Uzala (1975)
was funded by the Soviet Union and made in that country.
Kagemusha (1980) became possible only when Francis Ford
Coppola and George Lucas persuaded Twentieth Century-Fox to
purchase foreign distribution rights. And Ran (1985) was co-
produced with a French company. These last two works, both set
in feudal Japan, told tragic stories amid visual splendor in cos-
tume and mise-en-scene. Seeming to regain energy as he neared
his eightieth birthday, Kurosawa made Akira Kurosawa's Dreams
(1990) for a Hollywood company and, returning to Japan, directed
Hachigatsu-no-Kyoshikyoku (Rhapsody in August, 1990), a film
concerned with a family's memories of the dropping of an atomic
bomb on Nagasaki, Japan,
in 1945 at the end of World War
11.
Juzo Itami
The principal new figure of Japanese mainstream filmmaking who
became part of international art cinema was Juzo Itami (b. 1933).
An actor and son of a film director, Itami was past fifty when he
completed his first film as director, Ososhiki (The Funeral. 1984).
A popular hit in Japan, the film was a bittersweet comedy about
a modern family's effort to conduct a funeral when a grandfather
dies. They watch an instructional video on how to behave and
make the "correct expressions" at a funeral, finding their legs
unaccustomed to the kneeling and squatting required by tradi-
tional ceremonies. Itami went on to make additional comedies
that gained greater success overseas than
in Japan, including
Tampopo (1986), on the subject of eating, and Marusa no Onna
(A Taxing Woman, 1987), featuring a woman tax Inspector.
Quebec Film
Filmmaking in Canada's French-speaking province of Quebec was
marginal twice over— to the country's dominant English-language
culture, and to the cinema of France.
It was further burdened by
political suppression in the 1970s and thereafter by ill-considered
government policies that hampered the development of Canadian
filmmakers. Nevertheless, followers of the medium were aware
that exceptional work was being produced by Quebecois film-
makers, including films such as ^Aon Oncle Antoine {My Uncle
Antoine, 1971
), directed by Claude Jutra (1930-1986); Les Ordres
(Orders, 1974), directed by Michel Brault, who had been cine-
matographer on the famous French cinema verite film Chronicle
of a Summer, and Les Bons Debarras (Cood Riddance, 1980),
directed by Francis Mankiewicz (b. 1944).
When Canadian film policy changed in the 1980s to support
domestic filmmakers, however, director Denys Arcand seized the
opportunity to gain a foothold in international art cinema with a
film whose title alone assured attention: Le Declin de I'empire
americain
( The Decline of the American Empire, 1986). The work
centered in fact on the sexual lives and frank sexual talk among a
group of history professors; the title derives from a professor's the-
ory that societies decline when personal desires take precedence
over common goals. Choosing to continue working from the mar-
gin, even after this success brought offers from Hollywood and
Europe, Arcand made Jesus de Montreal (Jesus of Montreal,
1989), concerning an actor who portrays Jesus in a Passion Play
and himself becomes a Christ-like critic of materialism and
immorality. Quebec filmmaking's status in international art cin-
ema was enhanced with the critical success at the 1992 Cannes
film festival of Leolo (1992), a film by director Jean-Claude
Lauzon (b. 1953) concerning the difficult family
life of a small boy
in Montreal.

The l-i ilms of
kij< aunsmdki
One of the pleasures of cinema
is the
possibility of discovering the world
through the medium— of continually
finding films from faraway places with
unfamiliar landscapes and fresh perspec-
tives. But in an era of co-productions and
international cinema culture, what
is
it
exactly that one discovers? The question
is prompted by the emergence of Aki
Kaurismaki (b. 1957) of Finland as a sig-
nificant new figure on the world film
scene in the 1990s.
It's probably fair to say that few
if any
Finnish filmmakers attained international
recognition before Kaurismaki and his
brother Mika (b. 1955) began making
films
(first together, then separately) in the
1980s. Their first project was Valehtelija
{The Liar, 1980), Mika's diploma film at
the Hochschule fiJr Fernsehen und Film
(Higher School for Television and Film) in
Munich, Germany, which Aki wrote and
in which he performed. "We were greatly
influenced by Godard and Truffaut," Aki
has said. "We stole shamelessly from
them."
Aki Kaurismaki's own films as a direc-
tor— beginning in 1983, he has made
nine in the period of a decade— have
continued to draw on an eclectic mix of
24.20. From left, bohemians

Aki Kaurismaki's La Vie de
Boheme(1992)
French New Wave, European art cinema,
hlollywood film noir, and B-picture road
movies. As with some other filmmakers of
his generation, his works seem to repre-
sent a heritage of moviegoing rather than
any specific cultural time or place. Yet the
lack of a specific social referent (or per-
haps
it should be described as an excess
of social referents) does not detract from
the pleasures of his films. Two works
released in 1989, Leningrad Cowboys Co
America and Tulitikkutehtaan Tytto(The
Match Factory Cirl), demonstrate his
range and style.
Leningrad Cowboys
is an absurdist
road movie concerning a Soviet rock
band's bumbling travels through the
United States to Mexico. Dressed
in dark
suits, with long pointed shoes and hair
arranged in foot-long forelocks, they carry
with them a coffin containing the body of
a band member who apparently froze to
death while practicing outdoors (the cof-
fin has holes to allow the deceased's long
pointed shoes and forelock, as well as the
handle of his guitar, to protrude, and
is
packed with ice to hold beer). When they
find success playing at Mexican wed-
dings, a sip of tequila revives the
apparent dead man.
The Match Factory Cirl is completely
different.
"I decided to do a picture that
would make Robert Bresson seem like a
director of epic action pictures," Aki
Kaurismaki has said:
in other words, to
make a film that would be more austere
than the most austere. The oppression
and betrayal of a Finnish worker, and her
acts of revenge, are shot with long takes
from a camera that rarely pans or moves.
But the implacable logic of this bleak film
is exhilarating. More recently Kaurismaki
directed

24.21. Pepa Marcos (Carmen
Maura) seems to like the idea of a
bed on tire in Spanish filmmaker
Pedro Almodovar's Mujeres al
borde de un ataque de nervous
(Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown,
1988).
Pedro Almodovar
No filmmaker made a more sensational international debut in the
1980s than Spain's Pedro Almodovar (b. 1951
). In the cultural
ferment following the end of Francisco Franco's dictatorship
in Spain, Almodovar moved from alternative filmmaking in Super-
8 and 16mm formats to a transgressive position within the
Spanish and international art cinemas. His concerns with homo-
sexuality and melodrama made him appear a successor to
Germany's Rainer Werner Fassbinder (see Chapter 21
), but
Almodovar crafted a sunnier, more bizarre combination of com-
edy and disorder: he could be tragic without quite being serious.
A series of features from 1982 to 1987— including works with
provocative titles like Laberinto de pasiones {Labyrinth of
Passioris, 1982) and La ley del deseo [Law of Desire, 1987)—built
a cult following in Europe and North America. He broke through
to wider audiences with Mujeres al borde de un ataque de ner-
vous {Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, 1988). A
key figure in Almodovar's work was Carmen Maura (b. 1946), a
versatile comic performer who appeared in nearly all his features
through Women on the Verge. Subsequent films such as iAtame!
{Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, 1989) and Tascones lejanos {High
Heels, 1991
)— which happened to be without Maura— raised the
question whether Almodovar's style of excess could survive trans-
lation to the mainstream.
THE GLOBAL VOICE
OF CINEMA
By the last decade of the twentieth century, cinema had come
closer to becoming a global medium of communication— not just
a form whereby messages went from the center to the periphery,
but one in which messages from the periphery could reach and
affect the center. In an age of television and facsimile machines,
film might appear expensive, slow, and outmoded for effective
communicative effort, yet as long as imagination and artistry were
powerful tools to open minds and shape visions, cinema
appeared to hold a fundamental place in global culture as the
medium began
its second century.
Yilmaz Giiney
The world has
its share of "unknown" cinemas— unknown not to
their practitioners and audiences but to mainstream criticism and
historiography. Indian film qualified as an unknown cinema in this
sense despite being numerically the world's largest; a similar case
was Turkey, where in the early 1970s nearly three hundred films
were produced annually, mostly action films and popular melo-
dramas (as in India). But Turkey became known to the cinema
community when YoHThe Way, 1982), by filmmaker Yilmaz
Gijney (1937-1984), won a top prize at the Cannes film festival.
GiJney had been a famous actor at the height of Turkey's film
productivity, but when he turned to directing in the 1970s he
clashed with the country's repressive regime. A political activist,
he was accused of sheltering students wanted by police and was
imprisoned more than two years without trial; after his release in
1974 he was almost immediately again arrested on a charge of
murder and sentenced to twenty-four years in prison.
Nevertheless while in prison he was able to prepare the script for
Yol, and Serif Goren took over as director. In 1981 GiJney
escaped and went to Switzerland, where he edited the film (Swiss
and German companies co-produced the work). After Yol he
made his last film, LeMur{The Wall, 1983),
in France. Both Yol
and The Wall deal with prison
life in Turkey, a country the film-
maker accuses of being a prison on both sides of the wall.
Though the films are not completely immune from the power
relations they mean to oppose (for example, they seem to accept
the dependent social status of women
in Turkish society), within
their limited framework they are powerful exposes of oppression.
The Official Story
Another work concerning oppression became the biggest interna-
tional success in Argentina's film history

Official Story, 1985), directed by Luis Puenzo (b. 1949), which
won a Hollywood Academy Award for foreign-language film. The

film
is set in 1983,
in the waning days of the military dictatorship
that ruled Argentina from 1976 and waged a "dirty war" of torture
and murder against alleged subversives.
It centers on a middle-
class teacher of Argentine history in a high school who gradually
discovers that the infant she had adopted was born in prison
to a mother who had been seized and became one of the
"disappeared."
The teacher's crisis of conscience
is echoed
in her classroom.
"No people can survive without memory," she piously tells her
pupils. "History
is the memory of the people." But her sanctimony
is undercut as she learns in her own
life how memory can be
elided, distorted, suppressed. "History," cries a rebellious student,
"is written by assassins." Portraying the painful enlightenment of a
conventional woman, Norma Aleandro (b. 1941), who had herself
fled the country in 1976, won an award for her performance at the
Cannes film festival.
Brazilian Cinema
A military dictatorship lasting several decades ended
in Brazil
in
the 1980s, and Brazilian filmmakers also turned to history as a
setting for their reflections on oppression. Nelson Pereira dos
Santos made Memorias do carcere (Memories of Prison, 1984)
based on memoirs of imprisonment during the 1930s by the
writer whose novel was the source for the director's Cinema Novo
classic Barren Lives (see Chapter 18). Oppression in class and
gender terms was the subject of A hora de estrela (Hour of the
Star, 1985), directed by Suzana Amaral
(b. 1933) from a novel by
Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector. Amaral was an unusual figure
who began filmmaking in her late thirties after raising nine chil-
dren, went to film schools in Brazil and the United States, and
made Hour of the Star, her first feature, past the age of fifty.
Though some critics found the film's treatment of a young peasant
woman's bleak city
life to be in the Cinema Novo tradition, the

director rejected any connection. Her work indeed lacked the mil-
itancy of the earlier movement, yet
it provided ample opportunity

its social and human themes through
a combination of naturalism, fatalism, and fantasy. There was also
a memorable script, by the director and Alfredo Oroz: when her
boW'riend rejects the young woman he tells her, "You're a hair in
my soup."
Middle Eastern Cinema
Among the "unknown" cinemas at the end of the twentieth cen-
tury, in the sense defined above, were those of Middle Eastern
countries— including Iran, the Arab world, and Israel. All films
(including Holl>'\vood's) contain cultural codes that may be
indecipherable to foreigners, but the problem
is exacerbated for
cinemas such as those in the Middle East where the cultures
themselves are not familiar to outsiders. Even in a work widely
distributed internationally, such as the Israeli film hAe'Achorei
Hasoragim iBevond the Walls, 1984), overseas spectators are
likely to overlook the issue of ethnic differences among the Israeli
characters that
is an important narrative element and of which
domestic audiences would be keenlv aware.
Directed by Uri Barbash ib. 1946), Beyond the Wa//s gained
international attention for its treatment of the conflict between
Israelis and Palestinians. Set within a prison (which had become

in the 1980s one of cinema's leading metaphors), the film follows
Yilmaz CiJney in suggesting that society itself has become a
prison— or,
in this case, has shackled
itself through the perpetua-
tion of stereotypes and divisive violence. Though cinematically
conventional and somewhat contrived, Beyond the Walls never-
theless searches for a new basis of cooperation between Israelis
and Palestinians within the symbolic space "beyond the walls."
A Palestinian treatment of similar themes was Noce en Galilee
{Wedding in Galilee, 1987). This was the first feature of
Palestinian director Michel Khieifi (b. 1950), who had studied film
in Belgium and gained funding for the work from Belgian and
French government sources. Set in a West Bank village, under
Israeli military occupation since the 1967 war, the film clearly
represents occupation as a kind of imprisonment (and an old man
recalls that the Turks and the British had been earlier occupiers of
the same territory). The narrative concerns a village leader's
agreement to invite the Israeli military governor to his son's wed-
ding in order to obtain permission to continue the ceremony past
the curfew hour. Though the wedding
is also a kind of metaphori-
cal space, the film widens out to show how politics informs not
only group relations between Palestinians and Israelis but also the
basic ties of family and society, the relations between parents and
children, women and men, even bride and groom.
African Cinema
No less unknown was the cinema of sub-Saharan or black Africa.
Some observers suggested an antipathy on the part of European
festivals and distributors to African films dealing with the history
of European colonialism
in Africa. An example cited
is Camp de
Thiaroye (Camp Thiaroye, 1988), codirected by the noted
Senegalese filmmaker Ousmane Sembene (see Chapter 18) with
Thierno Fatv Sow; the film
is set in Senegal
in 1944 and deals
with discrimination and brutality against black African soldiers
who had fought with the Free French Army during World War
II.
The African films that gained broad international exhibition
in the
1980s were set in enclosed tribal worlds, with apparently timeless
themes.
After Sembene, the most widely known African filmmaker was
Souleymane Cisse (b. 1940) of Mali, who studied for eight years at
the Moscow film school as a photographer, projectionist, and
director. His principal films, FinveiThe Wind, 1982) and Yeelen
(The Light, 1987), emphasized landscape, myth, and cultural tra-
dition.
"I hope in the future to be able to make films in which the
ancient depths of African culture will surge up again," Cisse has
said. "A cinema imitating that of America or Europe will be in
vain. We must immerse ourselves in our own sources." A similar
impulse animated the work of Idrissa Ouedraogo (b. 1954) of
the West African country Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta),
whose films Yaaba (1989) and
T/'/a/ (1990) were also concerned
with traditional village life. Both these works were made as co-
productions with France and Switzerland, with additional funding
support from sources in Britain,
Italy, and Germany.
THE PRESENT AND THE PAST
"We should be wary of talking about origins," were the words
with which this book began. As motion pictures celebrate their
centennial, we should again be wary of making claims not only
for beginnings but also for the present and the future. A hundred
years of cinema comprise a remarkable epoch: they have
witnessed the development of a vast commerce, a dazzling tech-
nology, sophisticated forms of popular entertainment, many
enduring works of art (and documentation), and untold social
consequences. Yet the past guarantees no future. Film history (as
was also noted at the beginning) may become some other
medium's prehistory. "Virtual reality" images and interactive nar-
ratives are already at hand as the twentieth century comes to
a close.
Nor does the present guarantee the past. History
is never fin-
ished, and rarely stays the same for long. As the writing of this
book comes to an end, film history looks different than
it did
when the work was started. Countries and their film cultures have
disappeared, lost or suppressed films have reappeared. The past
is
not a seamless whole, to be packaged and put away, but a site to
be rediscovered, struggled over, and reshaped. This book has
sought to lay the groundwork for readers to participate in the
invigorating and unending task, the remaking of film history.

which an action or ses-eral actions that occur as
continuous movements without interruption are
'analyzed,' or broken up into a series of dis-
crete images, invok ing different camera set-ups
and separate shots, and then reconstructed at
the editing stage from individual fragments into
a multi-image whole, to create a cinematic
experience of time and space different from
direct perception; montage became the more
common term for this editing stvle.

scientist Henri Chretien in the late 1920s which,
when fitted over a regular camera lens, greatly
expanded the lateral range of the image that

recorded with an anamorphic lens looked com-
pressed or "squeezed," but when projected
using an anamorphic lens over the regular f)ro-
jector lens,

the basic tasks of a director are preparing and
positioning performers for a shot, and supervis-
ing other personnel
in establishing the technical
aspects of production (such as camera position-
ing and lighting for a shot) and completing
post-production work (such as editing the film
and preparing the soundtrack), in nonfiction
filmmaking, directors may also carry out such
tasks as cinematography, sound recording, or
editing.
director of photography The person
in charge of
setting up the camera and the lighting on a
shot; in major studio productions, a different
person operates the camera during the shot.
dissolve The transition from one shot to another,
involving fades. A dissolve may be a fade-out to
a blank screen (often black, sometimes white)
and then a fade-in to a new shot, or a lap dis-
solve (short for overlapping),
in which one shot
fades while the next gradually becomes visible.
distribution The aspect of the film business
involving the delivering of films from producers
to theaters (exhibitors); distribution companies
also may finance film production, and bear the
initial costs of advertising and promoting a film.
documentary A term coined in the 1920s and
still widely used to describe nonfiction films,
that
is, films that are made to record or docu-
ment social actuality.
dolly A wheeled vehicle holding the camera and
operator for shots involving camera movement;
also the process of moving the camera on such
wheels.

cal subjects and emphasizing production
values such as extensive location shooting, big
sets, ('labf)rale costumes, and large casts.

location;
it can function as a master shot but
more often precedes
it.

tion of motion picture theaters.
exposure The process of exposing film to light
and recording images through control of the
size and duration of the opening through which
light strikes the photographic film in a camera.
Expressionism A movement in the arts in early-
twentieth-century Europe, especially Germany,
that was opposed to naturalism and efforts to
depict reality. Expressionists believed that art
derived from inner vision rather than from
impressions of a real world or from conventions
of artistic practice. The term has been used to
describe German filmmaking practices after
World War
I, exemplified by The Cabinet of Dr.
Caiigari, that emphasize non-realistic sets,
supernatural themes, and the psychic states of
protagonists.
extreme long shot A location shot taken from a
considerable distance.
fade The gradual change of light signaling the
beginning or end of a shot; a fade-in begins
with a dark screen and brightens to become a
completely visible scene, while a fade-out
begins with a fully lighted scene and darkens to
blackness.
fast motion A shot that makes people or objects
appear to be moving faster than their normal
speed, achieved by photographing fewer feet of
film per second than standard, or by speeding
up projection.
feature The principal attraction on a mixed pro-
gram; in early cinema the term came into use
with films of four reels (40 minutes to one hour)
or more. Over the decades the length of feature
films has increased to a range between 100
minutes and two hours, with many longer.
fill light A light that adds to a scene illumination
to areas that the key light does not cover.
film
Originally, a substance composed of sensi-
tized paper, coated with gelatin emulsion, on a
roll, developed
in 1885 by George Eastman and
William H. Walker;
later, a generic name for the
material on which
still and motion pictures are
photographed; also, a general term for motion
pictures.
film noir A film movement In Hollywood cinema
from World War
II to the late 1950s, perhaps
the only such movement to be named retro-
spectively (by French critics in a 1955 book).
With many sources and definitions, film noir
works are distinguished by their dark and
oppressive visual style and narratives of desper-
ation and entrapment that defied Hollywood's
conventions of happy endings and good
tri-
umphing over evil.
film stock
Sensitized celluloid made into perfo-
rated rolls that are exposed in motion picture
cameras. In the first decades of cinema film
stock was made from cellulose nitrate, which
was highly flammable; this was replaced around
1950 by a cellulose triacetate base. Images are
recorded on a light-sensitive coating on the
celluloid, called emulsion. Changes in the
chemical composition of the emulsion affect
its
sensitivity; the development of panchromatic
negative film
is an example.

is
reprinted on the celluloid strip, so that when
projected
it appears as a
still image.
futurism A movement in the arts launched in
1909 by Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.
Disdaining what they saw as the sentimentality
and nostalgia of nineteenth-century art, futurist
poets and visual artists wanted to create works
that represented the dynamism of their contem-
porary world, dominated by technology,
movement, and speed. Futurism was also
important in Russia.
gaffer The chief electrician on a film crew;

nineteenth-century Impressionist aesthetic in
painting.

entire sequence of shots; intellectual montage
includes techniques such as synecdoche (the
part standing for the whole) and metaphor (in
his cinematic usage, the juxtaposition of unre-
lated images to generate associations in the
spectator's mind).
intercutting A term for interweaving scenes or
sequences from separate times or locations in a
film's continuity; though sometimes
it
is used as
a synonym for crosscutting, the latter term gen-
erally implies a more direct narrative link
between simultaneous events.
intertitles

524

between shots during the silent era (and less fre-
quently later
I to announce a change of scene or
location, give dialogue lines, guide the specta-

scene: high key lighting indicates a brightK
lit
scene low key a darker scene.
Kinemacolor A two-color filmmaking process
introduced in 1908 in Britain b\ George Albert
