Our task must be to free ourselves
from this prison by widening our
circle of compassion to embrace
all living creatures and the
whole of nature in its beauty.
The egg-laying hen on the right has had her eye poked out.
Our task must be to free ourselves
from this prison by widening our
circle of compassion to embrace
all living creatures and the
whole of nature in its beauty.
ALBERT EINSTEIN letter dated 1950, quoted in H. Evesâ€™
Mathematical Circles Adieu, 1977
