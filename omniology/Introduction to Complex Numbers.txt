Where are we going? 
View this lesson on YouTube [1]
•	 We will learn about a new kind of number known as a “complex number”.
•	 We will discover the basic properties of complex numbers and investigate some of their 
mathematical applications.
Complex numbers rest on the idea of the “imaginary unit” i, which is dened via
i =
√
−1
with i satisfying the equation
i2 = −1.
Even though the thought of i may seem crazy, we will see that is a really useful idea.

What is a complex number? 
1.1.2	
Why are complex numbers AWESOME?
There are at least two reasons why complex numbers are AWESOME:-
1.	 their real-world applications;
2.	 their ability to SIMPLIFY mathematics.
For example, i arises in the solutions
x(t) = ei√
k/m t and x(t) = e−i√
k/m t.
to a basic spring-mass dierential equation
md2x
dt2 + kx = 0
where: x = x(t) is the position of the mass at time t; m > 0 is the mass; and k > 0 is the stiffness 
of the spring.
Also, i appears in Fourier transform techniques, which are important for solving partial dierential 
equations from science and engineering.
Complex numbers are AWESOME because they provide a SIMPLER framework from which we can 
view and do mathematics.
As a result, applying methods involving complex numbers can simplify calculations, removing a lot of 
the boring and tedious parts of mathematical work.
For example, complex numbers provides a quick alternative to integration by parts for something like

e−t cos t dt
and gives easy ways of constructing trig formulae, for example
sin(x + y)
=
sin x cos y + cos x sin y
cos 2θ
=
cos2 θ −sin2 θ
so you might never have to remember another trig formula ever again!

Here are some examples of complex numbers:
3 + 2i,
−7 + 3i,
6 −i,
2i,
−1 −4i,
−2 −2i.
The Cartesian form of a complex number z is
x + yi
or
x + iy
where x and y are both real numbers and i is known as the imaginary unit i = √−1 and 
satises i2 = −1. The number x is called the “real part of z”; while y is called the “imaginary 
part of z”.

Basic operations involving complex numbers
2.3.1	
What is the geometric explanation of multiplication?
Let us consider z = 2i and w = 1 + i in the complex plane.
If we compute the distances from z and w to the origin (using Pythagoras) then we see that
|z| = 2,
|w| =
√
2.
Now consider the line segments joining z and w to the origin. If we compute the angles θ1, θ2 
to the postive real axis (using trig) with −π < θk ≤π then we see
θ1 = π/2,
θ2 = π/4.
Now consider zw = −2 + 2i. We have
|zw| = 2
√
2,
θ3 = 3π/4.
We thus see that |zw| = |z| |w| and θ3 = θ1 + θ2.

2.4.1	
How to divide by a complex number
Division of two complex numbers involves multiplying through by a “factor of one” that turns the 
denominator into a real number. To do this, we use the “conjugate” of the denominator.
If z = 2 + i and w = 3 + 2i then
z
w
=
2 + i
3 + 2i
=
2 + i
3 + 2i ∗3 −2i
3 −2i
=
(6 −2i2) + (3i −4i)
(9 −4i2) + (6i −6i)
=
8 −i
13
= 8
13 −i 1
13.
Example.
Observe that the denominator is now real and we can (say) easily plot the complex number z/w.
If we interpret division as a kind of multiplication, then the geometric interpretation of division can also 
be seen through rotation/stretching.

Video 7: What is the complex conjugate?
View this lesson on YouTube [7]
As we saw when performing division of complex numbers, an idea called the conjugate was applied to 
simplify the denominator. Let us look at this idea a bit further.
For a complex number z = x + yi we dene and denote the “complex conjugate of z” by
¯z = x −yi.
Important idea (Complex conjugate).
If z = 3 + i then ¯z = 3 −i. If w = 1 −2i then ¯w = 1 + 2i. If u = −1 −i then ¯u = −1 + i.
For any point z in the complex plane, we can geometrically determine ¯z by re ecting the position of z 
through the real axis.

To measure how “big” certain complex numbers are, we introduce a way of measuring their size, known 
as the modulus or the magnitude.
For a complex number z = x + yi we dene the modulus or magnitude of z by
|z| :=

x2 + y2.
Important idea (Modulus/magnitude of a complex number).
Geometrically, |z| represents the length r of the line segment connecting z to the origin.

How big are complex numbers?
4.1.1	
Properties of the modulus/magnitude
Let z = a + bi and w = c + di. Some basic properties of the modulus are:-
|z|
=
√
a2 + b2 ≥0;
|z|
=
0
iﬀ
z = 0;
|z2|
=
|z|2;
|z + w|
≤
|z| + |w|;
|αz|
=
|α||z| where α is a real number;
|zw|
=
|z||w|;
z¯z
=
|z|2.
Important idea.
If z = 7 + i and w = 3 −i then calculate:
|z + iw|.
Example.
If w = 1 + 4i then calculate the following in Cartesian form x + yi:
|w + 2|.
We have
|w + 2|
=
|3 + 4i|
=

Video 20: Polar trig form of complex number
View this lesson on YouTube [20]
Instead of the Cartesian x + yi form, sometimes it is convenient to express complex numbers in other 
equivalent forms.
Using trigonometry in the complex plane we see that we can express any (non-zero) complex number 
z in the form
z = r(cos θ + i sin θ)
where r is the distance to the origin and θ is the angle to the pos. real axis.
For z = x + yi a polar trig form is z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) where:
r =

x2 + y2 = |z|;
x = r cos θ,
y = r sin θ,
tan θ = y/x.
We denote the angle θ by arg(z) and call arg(z) “an argument of z”.
Important idea (Formulae for polar trig form).
Because cos θ = cos(θ + 2kπ) and sin θ = sin(θ + 2kπ) for all integers k, the angle θ associated 
with a complex number is not unique.
For example, if z = 1 + i then we may represent z in polar trig form via
z =
√
2(cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4))
and
z =
√
2(cos(9π/4) + i sin(9π/4)).
Thus, θ = arg(z) is not uniquely determined by z.

To provide some deniteness, we dene what is known as the principal argument of z.
For any complex number z = x + yi with θ = arg(z) we can always choose an integer k 
such that −π < arg(z)−2kπ ≤π. We denote this special angle by Arg(z) and call Arg(z) 
“the principal argument of z”.
Important idea (arg(z) versus Arg(z)).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Video 21: Polar exponential form of a complex number
View this lesson on YouTube [21]
Instead of the Cartesian form z = x + yi or the polar trig form z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) sometimes 
it is convenient for multiplication and solving polynomials to express complex numbers in yet another 
equivalent form
z = reiθ.
For z = x + yi a polar exponential form is z = reiθ where:
r =

x2 + y2  and tan θ = y/x.
Important idea (Formula for polar exponential form z = reiθ).
If we combine the polar exponential form with the polar trig form then we obtain a special identity 
called “Euler’s formula”
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ
and if θ = π then we obtain the famous formula
eπi = −1.
Because cos θ = cos(θ + 2kπ) and sin θ = sin(θ + 2kπ) for all integers k, the angle θ associated 
with a complex number is not unique.
For example, if z = 1 + i then we may represent z in polar trig and polar exp. form via
z =
√
2(cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)) =
√
2eiπ/4
and
z =
√
2(cos(9π/4) + i sin(9π/4)) =
√
2ei9π/4.
Thus, θ = arg(z) is not uniquely determined by z.

We prove
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ.
Important idea (Euler’s formla).
Let f(θ) := cos θ + i sin θ. Thus, f(0) = 1. Dierentiating f we obtain
f ′(θ)
=
−sin θ + i cos θ
=
i2 sin θ + i cos θ
=
i(cos θ + i sin θ)
=
if(θ).
We have formed a dierential equation/initial value problem. Note that g(θ) := eiθ  also satises the IVP. 
By uniqueness of solutions, f ≡g, that is,
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ.
This also means that the polar exponential form reiθ is an accurate representation of any complex 
number z.

10.1.1	
Regions in the complex plane
We can use equations or inequalities to represent regions within two-dimensional space.
With a bit of care, we can also represent regions in the complex plane via similar techniques.
We know that the modulus |z| of any complex number z is the length of the line segment joining z to 
the origin. Thus, the set
{z ∈C : |z| < 3}
is the set of all complex numbers, whose distance to the origin is less than three units. This is an open 
disc, centred at the origin, with radius three.
Similarly, the set
{z ∈C : |z −(2 + i)| < 3}
is the set of all complex numbers, whose distance to 2 + i is less than three units. This is an open disc, 
centred at the 2 + i, with radius three.
Similarly, the set
{z ∈C : |z −i| = 3}
is the set of all complex numbers, whose distance to i is exactly three units. This is a circle, centered at 
the i, with radius three.
The set
{z ∈C : |z −2| = |z −4|}

Video 42: How to factor complex polynomials
View this lesson on YouTube [42]
The basic theory for complex polynomials of degree n
p(z) := anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0
may be summarized as follows:-
•	 Every polynomial p(z) of degree n has at least one root over C. That is, there is 
at least one α such that p(α) = 0.
•	 The roots of complex polynomials with real coecients appear in conjugate pairs.
•	 If p(α) = 0 for some number α then (z −α) is a factor of p(z).
•	 Every polynomial of degree n can be factored into n linear parts. That is
	
p(z) = an(z −α1)(z −α2) · · · (z −αn)
where the αi are the roots of p(z).

a)	 Show p(2i) = 0;
b)	 Illustrate that z2 +4 is a factor of p(z) (without division) and also find the other 
quadratic factor;
c)	 Thus, factorize p(z) into quadratic factors.
