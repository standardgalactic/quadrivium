0. INTRODUCTION.
In this paper we prove some results about Grothendieck toposes
and geometric morphisms that derive from regarding a Grothendieck
topos (resp., the inverse image part of a geometric morphism) as a
cocomplete category (resp., cocontinuous functor) with additional pro-
perties. Specifically, if S 
is an elementary topos with natural number
object, then the product of two Grothendieck S -toposes coincides with
their "tensor product" as cocomplete S -indexed categories. Moreover if
p : E-&#x3E;S 
is 
a 
geometric 
morphism between elementary toposes
(with natural number objects), then the pullback of a Grothendieck S -
topos F along p coincides with the cocomplete S -indexed category
obtained 
from F 
(regarded 
as 
a cocomplete S -indexed category)
by "changing base along p". An immediate corollary of the latter fact
is 
a result about essential geometric morphisms which generalises a
theorem of Tierney on the pullback of locally connected geometric mor-
phisms (unpublished, but see [12J, V).
These results are seen as favourable evidence for the speculation
that 
one may be 
able 
to describe Grothendieck toposes in terms
of cocomplete categories in a way analogous to that in which Joyal
and Tierney have recently described the theory of locales as part of
the "commutative algebra" of complete lattices and arbitrary sup
preserving maps : 
see [8]. 
Thus replacing locales by Grothendieck
toposes and sups by colimits, Theorems 2.3 and 3.6 below are the
analogues of the results in III.2 and VI.1 of [8]. However the proofs
are not analogous : this is because in the one case they are immediate
corollaries of the characterization of a locale as a certain kind of
commutative monoid in 
the monoidal category of complete lattices
and sup-preserving maps equipped with its tensor product (the monoid
multplication giving binary meet in the locale and the unit giving the

44
top element), whilst we do not know of an analogous characterization
of a Grothendieck topos over the 2-category of cocomplete categories
equipped with its tensor product (and possibly other, more complicated
things). One of the fruitful results of Joyal and Tierney’s characterization
of locales is the ease with which one can deal with locale homomorph-
isms that have left adjoints (and in particular with open continuous
maps), simply because these left adjoints necessarily preserve sups.
Correspondingly here we obtain results about essential geometric mor-
phisms, since the left adjoint of the inverse image part of such a geom-
etric morphisms preserves colimits. A good test of the workability of
any description of Grothendieck toposes over cocomplete categories
would be whether it yielded more results along these lines. We have in
mind for instance, the speculation that if
is a comma square of Grothendieck toposes and geometric morphisms,
then f essential implies k essential (and k1 h*= g*f1 ). Such conjectures
(and their application to proving results about coherent logic) were the
original motivation for the considerations in this paper, but they were
also influenced by Lawvere’s lectures on "extensive and intensive quant-
ities" at Aarhus in June 1983.
Evidently both the statement and the proofs of the results in
this paper necessitate working in "category theory over an element-
ary topos S". The "small" part of this theory is contained within the
internal mathematics of the topos (cf. [7]) and thus can be presented
in an easily digestible form "as though S were the category of sets", or
more precisely, using the language of type theory. The "large" part of
’ category theory over S (and its interplay with the internal logic of S)
requires 
the 
use 
of 
fibrations 
aver S , 
or S -indexed categories ;
its study was initiated about a decade ago by B6nabou-Celeyrette and
Paré-Schumacher (cf. [4, 5, 6, 13]) and is 
still under development. In
particular an appropriate formal language and metatheorems that would
allow automatic transfer of suitably constructive arguments in ordinary
category theory to the S -indexed cas has not been worked out in full
generality. (We have in mind here the analogues of the Mitchell-Benabou
language, Kripke-Joyal semantics, etc. in topos theory.) So we cannot
refer the reader to a description of the formal language of category
theory 
over 
an arbitrary 
base topos 
S . Nevertheless for 
ease of
comprehension, the arguments of the first two sections of this paper
are given in an informal version of such a language, i.e. given "as though
S were the category of (constant) sets" (without of course using
any of the non-constructive properties that it has). In the last section,
where we consider category theory over different base toposes and the

45
connections induced by a geometric morphism between the toposes, of
necessity the use of indexed categories (or fibrations) is more overt.

1. COCONTINUOUS FUNCTORS.
Let S be an elementary topos with natural number object. In this
and the next section we are going to be working in "category theory
over 
S ". Within this context we need to recall some basic facts about
categories with small colimits and functors preserving those colimits,
which follow from the calculus of coends and left Kan extensions (cf.
[9] and 110 J, Chapters IX § X). As noted in the Introduction, the develop-
ment will be given as though S 
were the category of sets, and we
make the following
Convention. In Sections 1 and 2, "category", "functor", "natural transfor-
mation", etc. will mean S--indexed category, functor, natural transforma-
tion, etc. Similarly "small" will mean S-internal . (See the references
cited in the Introduction for an explanation of these concepts.)
Let COCTSS denote the 2-category whose 0-cells are locally small
categories with all small colimits, whose 1-cells are functors preserving
these colimits and whose 2-cells are all natural transformations between
such functors.
If C is a small category and A E COCTSS , then the category of
diagrams of type C in A , denoted [ C, A] , is again in COCTSS and we
have :
(1.1) Lemma. For C a smail category and A E COCTS S , [Cop, A] (resp.
[C, A]) is the tensor (resp. the cotensor) of A by C in the 2-category
COCTSS , i.e. there is an equivalence
(resp. an isomorphism
which is natural in B.
(To be precise, since the first of the above is an equivalence rather 
.
than an isomorphism, we mean "tensor" in the "up to isomorphism"
sense appropriate 
to COCTSS regarded 
as 
a bicategory ; cf [14].)
Proof. For IES 
and A E A, let I.A E A 
be the copower of A by I,
i.e. the coproduct of I copies of A. Thus if H : C-&#x3E; [COP, S] denotes

46
the Yoneda embedding, then for U E C and A E A we have
Then given F
by defining
Conversely given G E [C, COCTSS (A , B)], the coend
defines a functor G E COCTS 5 ([G°p, A], B ).
The assignments 
F l-&#x3E; F and G l-&#x3E;G7 
are functorial and define the
required natural equivalence
The natural isomorphism
is sirnpy the restriction of that for the full functor categories
For A E COCTSS and A E A , sending I E S to the copower I.A of
A by I gives a functor (-).A : S -&#x3E; A which preserves colimits. Conversely
any F E COCTS S(S , A) is determined by F(l) E A, since
The assignments A l-&#x3E; (-).A and F )+ F(l) are functorial and set up an
equivalence of categories :
(1.2) Lemma. There is 
an equivalence A - COCTS S (S, A), 
which is
natural in A E COCTSS . 
0
Combining (1.1) and (1.2) we have :
(1.3) Corollary. [CJP, S J is the free locally small cocomplete category on
the small category C in the sense that restriction along the Yoneda
embedding H : 
C-&#x3E; [C 31:3, S] induces an equivalence
for any A E COCTSS .

47
Given a functor f : C -&#x3E; A , 
the corresponding colimit-preserving
functor [Cop, S ] 
-&#x3E; A is colimHf , the left extension of f along H :
As usual, let S2 E [Cop S] denote the subobject classifier of the
topos of presheaves on the small category C. Thus for U E C, n(U)
is 
the set of sieves 
on U (i.e. the set of subobjects 
R &#x3E;-&#x3E; 
Hu 
in
Cop, SI).
(1.4) Definition. Let P be any collection of sieves on C. Say that a func-
tor f : C -&#x3E; A 
( A e COCTSS ) is P-cocontinuous 
if the corresponding
colimit-preserving functor 
sends each R&#x3E;-&#x3E; 
H 
in P to an isomorphism in A . Let P-cocts(C, A )
denote the full subcategory of 
[C, A] whose objects are such functors.
Remark. It is not hard to see that colim 1-/ feR 
&#x3E;-&#x3E; H ) is an isomorphism
in A iff, regarding R as a full subcategory of C/U, the diagram
(sending a: V -&#x3E; U to f(V)) has
as colimiting cone.
Now suppose that P is a subpresheaf of Q in [COP, S], i.e. that the
collection P of sieves on C is closed under taking pullbacks. Let P &#x3E;-&#x3E;n
denote the Grothendieck topology generated by PP Q . So we have
Shs (C, P), the Grothendieck S -topos of sheaves on the site (C, P)
and an associated sheaf functor
which since it is left adjoint to the inclusion Sh S(C, P) -&#x3E; [COP, S] 
is
a morphism in COCTSS for which the induced functor
is full and faithful (any A e COCTSS ).
We need the following mild generalization (from the case P = P)
of the kind of result to be found in [1], Exp. 111.1 : 
-
(1.5) Proposltion. 
The equivalence of Corollary (..3) restricts along the

48
the full and faithful functors a* and along the inclusion
to an equivalence
Proof. We must show that 
a functor 
f : 
C -&#x3E; A is 
P-cocontinuous
iff the corresponding morphisrn
in COCTS S , 
factors up 
to isomorphism through 
a . 
Since [CP,S J
and Sh s(C, P) have small dense subcategories, colimit-preserving func-
tors from them to 
A E COCTSS have right adjoints. In particular, the
right adjoint of F = colim H f : IC’P, S]-&#x3E;A is
Consequently for any factorization of F through a in COCTSS :
there is a corresponding diagram of right adjoints :
It follows that F factors through a in COCTSS iff for each A E A , FA
is 
a P-sheaf. But since P is a pullback stable collection of sieves, a
presheaf is 
in Sh S(C, P) just in case it satisfies the sheaf condition
for sieves in P. (For a proof of this fact see for example [12], Theorem
24.) So F factors through a iff for all A E A and all 
m : R &#x3E;-&#x3E; Hum
P we have
i.e. iff for all R, 
(Fm )* : A(FHUg A) -&#x3E; A (FR, A) is bijective, all A E A ;
i.e. iff for all R F Hu in P, F(R-&#x3E; H 0 is an isomorphism in A ; i.e. iff
F is P-cocontinuous.

2. PRODUCT AND TENSOR PRODUCT.
For A, B, C E COCTSS, call 
a functor F : AxB-&#x3E;C a bimor-
phism if 
it preserves small colimits in each variable separately ; let
BIM(A, B ; C) denote the category of such functors. Similarly for
small categories C, D and collections P, Q of sieves in C and D
respectively, 
call 
a 
functor C x D -&#x3E; A P, Q- cocontinuous 
iff 
for
all (U, V) E C x D
and
let P,Q-cocts(C, D ; A ) 
denote 
the 
full 
subcategory of [ C x D, A]
whose objects are such functors.
Note that since Q-cocts(D, A) is locally small and the inclusion
Q-cocts(D, A) -&#x3E; [D, A] creates small colimits, we have that
and the exponential adjointness
restricts to
(2.1) Proposition. Suppose that P and Q are pullback stable collections
of sieves in C and D respectlvely ; let P , Q denote the Grothendieck
topologies generated by them and put E = ShS(C, P), F = Sh S(D, Q ).
Then com position with 
gives an equivalence
Proof. Evidently the exponential equivalence
(cf. [11], 
p. 
35) 
restricts 
to 
one between BIM(E, F ; A) and the
category of colimit-preserving functors from E 
to the category of
colimit-preserving functors F-&#x3E; A . So by repeatedly using Proposition
(1.5) and by the Remark above, we have

50
and this composite equivalence is induced by (a x a) o (H x H).

(2.2) Definition. The tensor product A !8) B of A and B in COCTSS 
if it
exists is the domain of the universal bimorphism from A x B , i.e. there
should be a bimorphism O:AxB-&#x3E;AOS B, composition with which
gives an equivalence 
(all C E COCTSS). 
Without imposing further conditions on A and B, it is not clear
that A 03 B always exists. (Recall that we require objects in COCTSS
not only to have small colimits, but also to be locally small.) However
by (1.1) and (1.2) we have
so that A OS. [C, sJ is lc, AJ. In particular [C, S] OS [D, S] 
is
The universal bimorphism
sends (X, Y) E [C, S] x D, S] to X O Y E [CxD, S] where
Note that
is also the product [C, SJxS[D, S] of [C, S] and [ D, S] in the 2-category
GTOPS of Grothendieck (= bounded) S-toposes and geometric morphisms
(cf. [7J, Cor. 4.36). More generally we have :
(2.3) Theorem. For Grothendieck S-toposes E, F, the tensor product
E 0 F of E and F regarded as objects in COCTS s is given by their
product E xS F in GTOP S.
Proof. Suppose E = SHS(C, J), 
F = Sh S (D, K) 
for 
small 
sites (C, J),
(D, K). Then the product E x F can be constructed as the sheaf sub-
topos of the product [(Cx D)OP, sJ of [Cop , S] and I DOP, sJ given by
the smallest Grothendieck topology on C x D that makes both

51
dense. Here
are the product projections (so that P1* is given by precomposition with
the 
projection 
functor (C x D?P + COP 
and similarly 
for p*2 ) 
and
d: 1 &#x3E;-&#x3E; J, d : 1 &#x3E;-&#x3E; K 
are the generic dense monomorphisms in [Cop, S]
and [D °p, 5 J.
The image of the map pf J -+ S¿ classifying pl (d) : 1 &#x3E;-&#x3E; p*J in
[(C x Dpp, S] consists exactly of sieves of the form
Similarly for pl(d): 1 &#x3E;-&#x3E; p*K. Thus with notation as in Section 1,
where P is the (pullback stable) collection
of sieves in C x D. Hence by Proposition (1.5)
naturally in A e COCTSS . The result will 
then 
follow by Proposition
(2.1) if we can show that
But given f : C x D-&#x3E;A, employing the "Fubini" property for iterated
coends (cf. 
[10], IX.8) we have for any V E D and X E [Cop, S] 
that
naturally in X and V. Similarly for U 
J E C
naturally 
in Y E [DOP, 5] and U E 
C. Thus f E P-cocts(CxD, S ) iff for
all U E C, V E D, R E J(U) and S E K(V)
and

52
are isomorphisms in A , i.e.
are isomorphisms, i.e. iff f E J,K-cocts(C, D ; A ).
Remark. Letting
be the product projections in GTOP 5’ then the universal bimorphism
simply sends (
3. CHANGE OF BASE.
Suppose that p : E -&#x3E; S is a geometric morphism between element-
ary toposes (with natural number object). It induces a 2-functor
where for 
B E COCTS F 
, Plt B 
is the S-indexed category whose fibre
over I E S is
and similarly for morphisms in S . By definition of diagram categories
of the form [C, A] , the above equality extends to
for any category C in 5 . 
(3.2) Definition. For A E COCTS, 
p #A 
E COCTSE 
will denote the
left adjoint of p# at If (if 
it exists), in the sense that there is 
a
morphism n : A -&#x3E; pjjp A in COCTSS such that for each B E COCT SE 
the functor
is 
an equivalence. As usual, the universal property ensures that p
is a bicategory homomorphism where defined.
#
As in the case of the tensor product OS, whilst it is not clear that
p 
is always defined, it is on the free objects of COCTSS . Indeed by
Corollary (1.3) and (3.1), we have equivalences

53
which are natural in 
B E COCTSS . So we can take p"[C, S ] to be
[p* C, E]. Now recall ([7], Cor. 4.35) that
is a pullback square of toposes and geometric morphisms, where
is the functor p* applied to prepheaves (= discrete fibrations). Thus for
the presheaf topos [C°p, S], p" [Cop, S] coincides with the pullback of
[Oop, S] E GTOPS along p ; indeed the unit
is given by p* regarded as an 5-indeed functor. We shall see that this
holds for all Grothendieck S -toposes.
(3.4) Definition. Call a diagram of the form
in COCTSS a coinverter diagram if Q is universal with the property that
Q(p is an isomorphism, in the sense that for any D E COCTSS ,
is 
full 
and faithful and has essential image those H: B -+ D for
which Hcp is an isomorphism.
Note that for the, above .coinverter diagram, if pit A and p#B
exist (then so do p F, p G, pl) and if
is a coinverter diagram in COCTSE, then we can take p#C to be D .

54
To apply this when A and B are free on small categories, we need
to examine more closely the morphisms between such free objects in
COCTSS. Up to equivalence these are just B6nabou’s 
profunctors
(or "distributeurs" or "modules" ; cf. [3] and 171, 2.4) ; for by (l.l) and
(1.3) we have
We shall take a profunctor froin C to D to be a diagram f E I DopxC, S I
and denote it 
f : C-&#x3E; D. Let Profs denote the bicategory of internal
categories profunctors and natural transformations in S: the composition
of f : C+-&#x3E; D and 
g : D +-&#x3E;E in Prof 
is given by the usual coend
formula :
Now denoting the- presheaf category [ C9P, S] by C, the assignment
C /+C extends to a homomorphism of bicategories
which is full and faithful in the sense that
is an equivalence. Indeed this equivalence is given by (1.1) and (1.3) :
for f E Prof S(C, D) = [Dop xC, S], f : C-&#x3E; D in COCTSS is given by
(Thus (:)= Profs (1, -) where 1 is the terminal category in S .)
Given a profunctor
uces
and this corresponds to a profunctor p*C+-&#x3E;p*D in E. Tracing through
the equivalence (3.3), one finds that this profunctor is just

55
commutes up to isomorphism.
(3.5) Proposition. Suppose X E [COP, S] : thus X is given by a discrete
fibration over C in S, which we denote by 7 : X -&#x3E;C. Let 7T. denote the
profunctor X+-&#x3E;C induced by 7 viz
(i) Subobjects A &#x3E;-&#x3E; X in [C°P, S] correspond to subobjects D &#x3E;-&#x3E; tt
in Prof S(X, C) which are strict in the sense that for each f : x + y in X
is a pullback square in [Cop,S]. Moreover this correspondence is pre-
served under change of base : if m : A &#x3E;-&#x3E; X corresponds to 1 : 
D &#x3E;-&#x3E; 
tt.
then p*m : p* A 
&#x3E;-&#x3E; p*X corresponds to
(ii) If D &#x3E;-&#x3E; 7, corresponds to A &#x3E;-&#x3E; X as in 0), then
is a coinverter diagram in COCTS S , where J is the least topology
on C making A &#x3E;-&#x3E; X dense, and a is the associated sheaf functor. (So in
particular 
every 
Grothendieck S-topos 
has 
a 
"free presentation"
in COCTSS by a coinverter of the above form.)
Proof. (i) Given A &#x3E;-&#x3E; X, define D &#x3E;-&#x3E; 7, by letting, for each x E X,
be given by the pullback

56
in [Cop, S] (where x, corresponds to x under the Yoneda isomorphism
Evidently D(-, x ) &#x3E;-&#x3E;HttX is natural in x and gives a strict monomorphism
D&#x3E;-&#x3E;tt. 
Conversely 
given 
a 
strict monomorphism 
D &#x3E;-&#x3E;tt. 
for 
each
x E X, let XX: H 
&#x3E;-&#x3E;n classify D(-, x) &#x3E;-*7. (-, x) = HttX : 
Since D F iT. is strict, the maps (Xx l
x E X) form a cone under
But the colimit of this diagram is just X E [Cop S] ; so on taking co-
limits 
over X, 
the 
above pullback squares yield another pullback
square
and hence A = colimxD(-, x) &#x3E;-&#x3E; X is a monomorphism and determines a
subobject of X.
That the above two constructions are mutually inverse is immediate ’
.from their definitions and the usual properties of finite limits and (int-
ernal) colimits in 
a topos. Moreover p* perserves such limits and co-
limits : so if 
i : D P TT. is a strict monomorphism in Prof Sex, C), then
is again one in ProfE (p*X, p*C) and

57
commutes. The last part of (i) follows from this.
(ii) Let 
X: X -n classify A &#x3E;-&#x3E; X 
in [C°p, S], and let 
P &#x3E;-&#x3E;n be
the image of X. Thus P consists precisely of the sieves D(-, x) -&#x3E; H x
(x E X) where D &#x3E;-&#x3E; 1T. is defined from A&#x3E;-&#x3E; X as in (i). So given 
ttX
in COCTS S’ F i is an isomorphism in
iff Fi H is an isomorphism in [X, A], i.e. iff for all x E X,
is an isomorphism in A , i.e. iff F o H : C -&#x3E; A is P-cocontinuous. The
result now follows from proposition (1.5) and the fact ([7], 3.59 (ii))
that P, the least Grothendieck topology containing P, is indeed the
least topology making A &#x3E;-&#x3E; X dense. 
&#x3E;
(3.6) Theorem. Let p : E -+ S be a geometric morphism between element-
ary toposes with natural number objects. Then for any bounded S-topos
F -&#x3E;S, regarding F as an object of COCTSS , p F exists and coincides
with the pullback (in the bicategory of toposes and geometric morphisms)
of F-&#x3E; S along p.
Proof. Suppose F = ShS (C, J), (C, J) 
a site in S . To the generic J-
dense 
monomorphism d : 1 FJ in 
[C°p, S ] 
there corresponds by
(3.5) (i) 
a strict monomorphism 1 : D P tt. in Profs (J, C) ; and by
(3.5) (ii) 
S
is a coinverter diagram in COCTS . Applying p# to r: D &#x3E;-&#x3E; Ti. we get
and since by (3.5) (i), P*l : p*D &#x3E;-&#x3E;p*tt. 
is 
the strict monomorphism
corresponding to p#(d) : 1 P 
p-&#x3E;J in [p* Cop, E] , the above diagram has

58
as its coinverter, where K is the least Grothendieck topology making
p*(d) : 1 -&#x3E; p*J dense. By the remarks after definition (3.4), it follows
that we can take p F to be Sh E( p*C, K). But K is precisely the "pull-
back topology" (cf. [7], 3.59 (iii)), i.e.
are pullback squares of toposes and geometric morphisms.
(3.7) Remark. If 
FE GTOP 5 and
is 
a pullback square, then the unit 11: F-&#x3E;p#p#F is given by q* as
an S-indexed functor.
By an S - essential morphism in GTOPS we mean one f : G -&#x3E; F
for which f *: F-&#x3E; G has an S-indexed left adjoint, denoted f! : C - F.
Thus for F e GTOPS , F -&#x3E; S is S -essential precisely wheri F is a
molecular Grothendieck S -topos (or : when F -&#x3E; S is bounded and loc-
ally connected ) ; 
cf. 
[2]. 
Tierney 
(unpublished) proved 
that 
the
property of being molecular is stable under pullback along a geometric
morphism and that the resulting pullback square
satisfies 
a Beck-Chevalley condition 
for objects, 
i.e. 
the canonical
map f*p* -&#x3E; q*g* 
is an isomorphism, or equivalently, the canonical map
g,q* -&#x3E; p*f, is an isomorphism. (See [12], V, for a proof of the symmetric
case : p b6unded, f locally connected.) More generally, we have :

)f base, 
i.e. given f : G - F 
in GTOPS, forming pullback squares :
we have : if f is S-essential, then g is E-essential. In this case the can-
onical map g’r*-&#x3E; q*f, is an isomorphism. Moreover if f is also connected
(which happens iff f’ is full and faithful, iff the unit of f, -i 
f*is an
isomorphism), then so is g. 
Proof. p# is a homomorphism of bicategories where defined. So
f1 -I f* 
in COCTSS (with counit an isomorphism if f connected)
gives 
In particular, p#(f*) is the inverse image of an E -essential geometric
morphism g : p#G -&#x3E;p#F over E, which is 
connected if 
f is. Further-
more since 
the unit of pll--1 p# 
is natural, in the fibre over 1 E 
S
we have that
commutes up to (canonical) isomorphism, i.e. by (3.7) that
commutes up to (canonical) isomorphism. Thus g is indeed the (essentially
unique) factorization of the pullback square

Applying the naturality of II to ft : G - F in COCTS 5’ we have (in
the fibre over 1 e S) that
