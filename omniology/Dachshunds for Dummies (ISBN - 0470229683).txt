Introduction
D
achshunds: What’s not to love? They’re cute, cuddly, smart,
and friendly, and they’re shaped like hot dogs — which is why
people occasionally call them wiener dogs! (I don’t think they mind.)
They come in all kinds of different colors and patterns, and you’ll
even find them in different sizes. If you like small- to medium-size
dogs with plenty of spunk and compassion, you’ll love Dachshunds.
You don’t have to know diddly-squat about Dachshunds to use 
this book. If you know nothing about dog care, this book has plenty
of information for you to start a rewarding relationship with 
a Dachshund.
And if you’re a seasoned dog-care veteran, I bet you’ll find this
book plenty useful. It’s filled with tips, tricks, and advice for life
with Dachshunds, including a good bit of technical information
about keeping your Dachshund healthy in all stages of its life.
About This Book
This book is your easy-to-understand primer on Dachshund 
care. I describe what Dachshunds are, not only in shape, size, 
and color — the things described in the official breed standard —
but also in terms of personality and temperament so that you can
decide if a Dachshund is the right dog for you. I help you discover
the best ways to find a great Dachshund, and I show you how to take
care of your Dachshund from the day you bring him home. I cover
housetraining, feeding, pest prevention, vet care, obedience training,
and much more. If you have a Dachshund or are considering buying
one, this book has all the information you need.
But this book doesn’t do everything. For one thing, it isn’t a boring
reference book. It isn’t a textbook on Dachshund history, medical
issues, or training (although it covers all those subjects). And it
isn’t a guide on breeding (which I don’t recommend for most pet
owners), on showing dogs, or on the complex ins and outs of dog
competition (although I do talk about plenty of fun dog sports and
activities you can enjoy with your Dachshund). This is a fun book, 
a sometimes irreverent book, a user-friendly book, and most of all 
a book that celebrates Dachshunds. You find out who and what

they are and how you can make the most of your relationship by
choosing the best one for you and taking the best possible care 
of your new pet.
Conventions Used in This Book
Every For Dummies book follows certain conventions, and in this
book, I do a few things to make your reading easier and more fun.
These conventions include the following:
 I use italics to highlight words I go on to define for you, and
when I include key words in a list, I put them in boldface.
 You’ll find all Web and e-mail addresses in monofont.
 Sometimes I call Dachshunds by their common nickname,
“Dachsies.” Some people also spell this nickname “Doxies.”
 When you see “Mini,” don’t think that I’m just being playful
with the Dachshund’s small size. This is a shortened version
of Miniature, which is a type of Dachshund.
 In general, when referring to Dachshunds, I alternate between
male and female pronouns between chapters. In other words,
Dachsies will be “he” in some chapters and “she” in others.
What You’re Not to Read
Okay, you can read the whole book if you want to — every word. 
I won’t mind one bit! But this book does include some information
that isn’t absolutely essential. For one thing, the sidebars (shaded
gray boxes) contain non-essential but fun facts or extra information
that may interest you. Skip them if you like. And when you see a
Technical Stuff icon, that means I’m getting more, well, technical,
so if you aren’t into that kind of thing, you can skip those, too.
But I do hope that you’ll read the rest of the book, because that’s
where the really important stuff lies — the information that will
help you and your Dachshund have a happier and more successful
life together.
Foolish Assumptions
They say a fool and his assumptions are soon parted . . . or maybe
they say that about money. Anyway, I do make some assumptions
about you, which may or may not be foolish. For one thing, I assume
Dachshunds For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
2

you love Dachshunds, or are thinking about falling in love soon. 
I assume you’re interested in being the best possible dog owner,
whether you’ve already brought home your new Dachshund or
you’re about to. I assume you have the time, the will, and the way 
to bring a Dachshund into your life, or that you have a Dachshund
you love and cherish and you want to learn how to improve your
relationship and dog-care skills. I also assume you’re interested in
training your dog — maybe doing some dog sports or possibly just
having the best possible little cuddly lap dog you can have.
I also assume you aren’t interested in becoming a Dachshund
breeder, and that you aren’t picking up a Dachshund to help 
you train for a triathlon, herd sheep, or be your hunting retriever.
(Hunting hound is a different story; your Dachshund can probably
play that role without a hiccup.) You know what Dachshunds are —
or you think you do — but you want to know more. Am I right?
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into parts, each containing related chapters
on a Dachsie topic. The following sections show what I cover in
each part.
Part I: Preparing to Live 
with a Dachshund
I start out by defining the Dachshund and I describe the different
varieties of Dachshunds that you’re likely to encounter. I then pro-
vide advice on where to find the Dachshund that may become your
new friend, and I include a discussion on the pros and cons of work-
ing with rescue shelters.
Part II: Starting Out on 
the Right Paw at Home
Find out how to prepare your home, yourself, and your family for
the fun-filled life with a Dachshund. I help you Dachshund-proof
your home and family, suggest what things to buy to be fully 
supplied, and explain what to expect when you bring your 
wiener-shaped friend home on that very first day.
Introduction

Part III: The Obedient Dachshund
(Not an Oxymoron)
After describing the Dachshund personality and helping you
understand your role as a trainer, I show you how to housetrain
your Dachshund. Then I provide helpful advice on how to teach
your Dachsie basic good manners and all the behaviors that any
good dog should know. I conclude this part with coverage of dog
shows and other fun competitions like agility and earthdog trials.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund
Stay Healthy
In this part, you find out what it takes to keep your Dachshund
happy and healthy, from vaccinations to good grooming to regular
exercise. I also describe in detail the back problems that many
Dachshunds develop, as well as a few other health problems 
some Dachshunds could experience. I then discuss the health
needs of — and joys of owning — older dogs.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book ends with top-ten lists, and this one is 
no exception. I present ten Dachshund books and ten Dachshund-
centric Web sites that you can peruse. Also, I list ten great people
foods Dachshunds can enjoy safely and ten foods no Dachshund
should ever eat.
Icons Used in This Book
Look for the following icons next to tidbits of useful information:
Here you’ll find dog-related tips and common-sense hints to 
make life with your Dachshund easier and more enjoyable.
I place this icon next to information that will help you prevent 
mistakes or warn you against actions that may potentially 
cause problems.
When you see this icon, expect to find interesting tidbits, lore, 
and information about Dachshunds and dogs in general.
Dachshunds For Dummies, 2nd Edition

This icon pops up when I’m describing technical terms and

Where to Go from Here
The great thing about For Dummies books is that they are references
rather than tutorials. I’ve organized this book into self-contained
chapters that you can read in pretty much any order you wish. So
skip around if that’s what you want to do. Of course, the progression
of chapters in the book is logically arranged just in case you want to
read the book from cover to cover.
So you can pick a topic out of the Table of Contents and start 
reading, or you can flip to the first page of Chapter 1 and read till
you get to the end. Either way, I’m sure you’ll enjoy the experience.
If you already know a lot about dog care, feel free to skip around 
and check out whatever Dachshund-related topics catch your fancy.
The detailed Table of Contents and Index should help you out. If you
don’t really know much about Dachshunds, be sure to read the first
part of this book to get the lowdown.

Part I
Preparing to Live
with a Dachshund

In this part . . .
I
begin this book by telling you what the heck a
Dachshund actually is (as deﬁned by the breed 
standard), and then I describe the different kinds of
Dachshunds you’re likely to encounter. I also provide
advice on where to ﬁnd the Dachshund that may become
your new friend, including a discussion on the pros and
cons of working with rescue shelters and other adoption
agencies.

 Choosing between one breed, two sizes
E
verybody loves a Wiener dog! Those funny bodies, those short
little legs, those floppy ears, those pleading eyes, and those
antics. Dachshunds are clowns. They can keep a room in stitches,
and they can coax even the most stolid disciplinarian into slipping
them just one more dog cookie. Dachshunds aren’t big dogs, so 
they don’t take up much room. And they’re so darned cute. Who 
can resist a pet like that?
Apparently, not many of us. As of 2006 (the most current statistics
available at the time of this printing), Dachshunds were the sixth
most popular dog breed in terms of registrations with the American
Kennel Club (AKC). They’ve been a little higher on the list and 
a little lower at times, but for more than a decade, the diminutive
Dachsie has sat comfortably in the top ten.
Many people own Dachshunds, so they can’t be too much trouble,
can they? Of course, a cute face and a good sense of humor aren’t
reasons in and of themselves to take on the 15-year-or-so responsi-
bility of owning a dog. Too many people don’t give pet ownership 
in general, and Dachshund ownership in particular, a lot of thought.
But you’re not like them, because you’ve already begun research 
by picking up this book. Good for you! Before you proceed further 
in your quest for the Dachshund of your dreams, read this chapter
to look closely at the responsibilities of Dachshund servitude
(because, as you’ll soon see, Dachsies own you, not the other 
way around). But what if you already have a Dachsie pup curled 
in your lap? Better late than never: You’re still at the right chapter!

Examining the Pros and Cons 
of Dachshund Ownership
Dachshund ownership is easy to romanticize: You and your cute
little wiener dog, together forever. You see yourself taking leisurely
walks through the park with your Dachsie by your side; relaxing
with a good book and his warm body on your lap; having a loyal
companion and friend, and a playmate for the kids; and having
friends comment on how well-behaved, well-trained, and 
intelligent your dog is.
Well, guess what? Life with a dog isn’t always like that. From 
sleepless nights with a new puppy to expensive medication to treat
health problems in your aging pet (see Chapter 18), having a dog as
a family member is a lot like having a child. It takes a lot of work and
a lot of time. It takes a physical, emotional, and financial commit-
ment. And it often ends in heartbreak, even when your dog lives 
to a ripe old age, because humans usually outlive dogs, and no 
one wants to say goodbye to a best friend.
On the flip side, living with a Dachshund will fill your life with fun.
You’ll always be the object of your Dachshund’s colossal affection.
You just need to be realistic and decide whether you’re ready to 
take on the responsibility. This section helps you put your feelings
in perspective.
Dachshund pros
Here are some major benefits to owning a Dachshund:
 Dachshunds love you unconditionally.
 Studies show that having a pet lowers blood pressure 
and helps to manage stress.
 Fulfilling your dog’s exercise needs may keep you in shape
(see Chapter 16).
 Dachshunds are great companions and listeners.
 Dachshunds can help teach children to respect and be 
kind to animals.
 Dachshunds are good at warning you if someone is 
outside the house — welcome or not.
 If you bring home a rescued Dachshund, you can feel good
about saving a life. And your dog will show his gratitude 
every day (see Chapter 5).

Dachshund cons
A hard fact of life is that the drawbacks to owning a Dachshund
can outweigh the benefits for some people:
 Dachshunds need plenty of attention and affection. They 
want to be with you, not tied to a chain in the backyard.
 Dachshunds aren’t people (even though they may think they
are!) and must be taught how to live with people. Without
proper and consistent teaching and socialization efforts, your
dog may end up becoming an annoyance to you, your family, 
or your neighbors. He may even inflict damage on your 
possessions, other people, or himself.
 Dachshunds must be housebroken, and until they are, 
your carpet or other household surfaces may suffer. (And
housetraining a Dachshund is no picnic; for more, see Part III.)
 Dachshunds cost money. Most people can expect to spend
around $1,000 in the first year to give their new puppies the
proper care and supplies.
 Dachshunds need your time. They require walking, feeding,
training, grooming, and attention every single day to stay
healthy and happy.
 Dachshunds aren’t a commitment to be taken lightly. 
Many live to be 15 years old or more.
 Your Dachshund will probably grow old and die before you
do. You have to make decisions about your Dachsie’s health
care and quality of life, and eventually you must deal with
your own grief.
 Your Dachshund requires regular preventive veterinary care. 
If he becomes ill or injured, you’re also responsible for his care
and treatment. Dachshunds are prone to several serious health
conditions (see Chapters 16 and 17), and the medical costs to
treat these problems can be high.
Chapter 1: Is a Dachshund Right for You? 11
A word about the AKC
The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a nonprofit organization, established in 1884, that’s
devoted to the advancement of purebred dogs. The AKC maintains a record of all 
registered dogs; publishes ideal standards for each recognized breed; sponsors a
variety of dog events, including conformation shows, obedience and field trials, agility
competitions, and the Canine Good Citizen program; and produces educational 
information. (See Chapter 2 for more information on the AKC’s Dachshund standards.)

 Dachshunds tie you down. You can’t just fly off on a sponta-
neous vacation for a long weekend, or decide not to come
home after work without arranging for your dog’s care.
 Dachshunds don’t speak English. You have to learn to 
communicate with your dog in a way he understands.
How’s that for a reality check? Think long and hard about the 
commitment you’re about to make before you bring home 
a Dachshund.
Dachshunds are more stubborn than some breeds, so training
efforts can be frustrating for the beginner. Don’t give up. When 
in doubt, talk to your vet, hire a trainer, and practice, practice,
practice — every day. Eventually, you’ll be speaking the same 
language, and your Dachshund will understand what you want. 
He really does live to please you, even if it sometimes seems like
you live to please him.
Dachshunds: Not Just Any Dog
It’s one thing to prepare for a dog; it’s another thing to prepare for 
a Dachshund. Dachshunds have all the basic needs of a dog, but they
come with a few of their own special quirks and considerations. If
you have your heart set on owning a Dachsie — who can blame you
after seeing a cutie like the pup shown in Figure 1-1? — you must 
be ready to handle a few extras. The following list presents the
common characteristics of Dachshunds:
 Dachshunds have fragile backs. Because of their dwarfism 
(big dog, short legs), Dachshunds are genetically predisposed
to have faulty spines, which can become injured when handled
incorrectly, or sometimes for no apparent reason. Certain
things can be hard on a Dachshund’s back and can even 
result in a paralyzing disk rupture:
• Going up and down stairs
• Jumping off furniture
• Even running quickly around a sharp corner.
Get ready to carry your Dachshund up and down the stairs!
 Dachshunds love to jump. But because jumping is so hard 
on a Dachshund’s back, you need to keep an eye on your
Dachsie to keep him from jumping off high places like beds,
couches, porches, and so on. Some people install ramps in
their homes so their dogs can ascend and descend from high
places without jarring their spines. (For more on making your
home Dachshund-friendly, see Chapter 6.)
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund

 Dachshunds live to eat. Obesity puts further strain on 
a Dachshund’s back — not to mention his heart and entire
body. Cute and pleading as he may be, you must be prepared 
to keep your Dachshund’s eating under control. No, your
Dachshund shouldn’t eat that quarter-pound burger with
cheese, let alone too many extra dog treats!
Dachshunds (like all dogs) have fewer taste buds than humans,
so the taste of food isn’t as intense for them as it is for us. For
this reason, dogs are more likely to eat just about anything,
taste not withstanding.
 Dachshunds bark. Barking is part of their modus operandi.
They were bred to hunt badgers or other small game under-
ground (see Chapter 2). When the game was cornered, a
Dachshund would bark to alert his human. Although you 
can train any dog not to bark excessively, Dachshunds bark
pretty frequently. Get used to it, or don’t get a Dachshund.
 Dachshunds are manipulative. They’re cute, and they know
it. They’re clever, too. They can get you to do just about any-
thing, unless you have rules and you stick to your guns. Your
dog has to know that rules are rules and that what you say
goes. If you’re a big marshmallow when it comes to consis-
tency and rule enforcement, you can’t get angry at your dog
for making his own rules. Somebody has to do it!
Chapter 1: Is a Dachshund Right for You? 13
The Dachsie name game
The name Dachshundis German for “badger dog.” Although plenty of people pronounce
it like dash-hound, the word is correctly pronounced docks-hoont. Yet, in Germany, the
Dachshund isn’t called a Dachshund at all. The dog is a Teckel or Dackel. (Back in 
the 19th century, the Dachshund was even called the Royal Teutonic Dog by some.)
The name Dachshund is somewhat misunderstood. Dachs means “badger” in
German; hund doesn’t, contrary to what you may think, mean “hound.” It simply
means “dog.” Although Dachshunds are, to this day, classified in the Hound group
according to the American Kennel Club, they could arguably fit just as well with the
Terriers. Terrier means “earth dog,” and going underground is what Dachshunds
do best (well, one of the many things they do best). Dachshunds hunt by scent and
have keen noses like their Hound brothers and sisters, but if you’re on the other
side of a door, that bark sounds an awful lot like a Terrier.
In any case, categories don’t really matter. What matters is knowing that your
Dachshund will display characteristics of the Hound and the Terrier. You can call him
anything you like! (How about “good dog”?)

So, what would your Dachsie’s rules be? Here’s a good guess:
• I can do whatever I want to do, whenever I want to do it.
• If I touch it, lick it, chew it, shred it, smell it, or see it, 
it’s mine.
• Humans live to serve me.
Unless those rules sound reasonable to you (Hint: They
shouldn’t!), prepare to accept your role as pack leader.
Figure 1-1: Dachsies, although cute, love to bark, jump, and manipulate.
Understanding a Dachshund’s
Special Needs
Dachshunds have special-care needs related to preserving 
the integrity of their spinal cords. Dachshunds are chondrodys-
trophic, an inherited condition that results in dwarfism and makes
the Dachshund’s spine vulnerable to disc rupture. One hard jump 
off a high bed, a fall from a porch, or even a sudden twisting move-
ment to catch a ball can rupture a disk. The result can range from
severe pain to paralysis — temporary or permanent. (For a more
detailed discussion of disk disease, see Chapter 17.)

Of course, not every Dachshund is doomed to suffer this debilitat-
ing and painful condition, and I hope you won’t be dissuaded from
bringing a Dachshund into your life out of fear. But caution is 
warranted. Here are some steps you can take to care for your dog:
 Avoid long or steep flights of stairs and jumps off high places.
 Steer clear of any activities, like vigorous tug-of-war games,
that can twist the spine.
 Keep your dog slim (for more on diet, see Chapter 8).
 Exercise for fun and for preventive measure. Daily walks 
and plenty of activity are important to keep a Dachshund’s
muscles strong and stable so they can support the spine.
Just be sure that the activities you choose are the kinds 
a Dachshund excels in — brisk walks and hikes, organized
field-trial or earth-dog competitions (see Chapter 15), or 
just playing in the park.
In other words, just like a human with a weak back, Dachshunds
need to exercise properly, eat a healthy diet, and avoid certain
movements to minimize the possibility of injury. If you follow 
these responsible Dachsie-owner rules, chances are your
Dachshund will never have a problem.
What’s Your PQ (Patience
Quotient)?
Living with a Dachshund requires a degree of patience. Let me
emphasize this one: Patience.
Chapter 1: Is a Dachshund Right for You? 15
“How common is this flimsy 
disk problem?”
According to the Dachshund Club of America, Inc. — in its must-have publication
Canine Intervertebral Disk Disease (available from the DCA for free — see Chapter 20
for contact information) — approximately one in four Dachshunds will experience a
disk problem. Evidence suggests that Intervertebral Disk Disease (IVDD) is a genetic
condition. The University of California, Davis, is currently investigating the genetic
nature of this disease. If the link can be determined, scientists may be able to develop
a test to predict which dogs are most likely to suffer from IVDD. Meanwhile, experts
do know that most incidents occur between the ages of 3 and 7, with age 4 being the
most common age of occurrence.

Do you have the patience required not to lose your cool when 
your Dachshund steals your pot roast right off your plate? Or eats
the last half of your book before you get to the exciting conclusion?
Or has an accident in the house again? I’m not saying you can’t get
irritated — or even downright angry — at your Dachshund. But
yelling, screaming, flailing your arms around, and, dog-forbid, 
hitting your pup are activities that will do more harm than good
every single time.
Every time your Dachshund makes a mistake — accidentally or on
purpose — you have an opportunity to teach him something. This 
is especially true when you catch him in the act. But this teaching
has to be performed calmly and rationally. Teaching a Dachshund 
is a lot like teaching a child: Losing your temper will only scare and
confuse your charge. Keeping your cool will prove that you’re the
pack leader and the one with all the power. (For more on training
your Dachshund, head to the chapters of Part III.)
Think long and hard about whether you have a short fuse or a long
one before bringing home a Dachshund. And then, who knows? You
may end up with a perfect little angel, and the whole discussion will
be moot. Better to be prepared, however, because most Dachshunds
are about half-angel, and half-, well . . . you know.
Dachshund Dollars: The 
Financial Commitment
Before you purchase any dog, whether Dachshund or Great Dane, 
be aware that you’ll have to make a financial commitment as well as
emotional and time commitments. Sure, you don’t have to take your
pet to the vet. You won’t be breaking any law if you don’t. But with-
out regular veterinary visits, puppies have a much higher chance of
becoming sick and dying from a serious disease, like parvovirus or
distemper. And throughout their lives, adult and senior dogs need
regular checkups, vaccinations (it is, in fact, against the law to skip
the rabies vaccine), and tests to maintain their health and to catch
health problems in the early stages. In addition, your vet can help
you with wormings, flea control, and heartworm prevention, and 
can give you advice on general issues of care, behavior, and training.
Worth every penny!
Puppies are immune to many diseases while nursing on mother’s
milk. As soon as a puppy is weaned and you take him home, how-
ever, his immunity quickly disappears and he’s vulnerable to a
number of serious diseases until he can build up his own immune
system. Vaccinate your puppy according to your veterinarian’s 
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
16

recommendations to keep him safe during this gap of time. 
(For more on the first vet visit and which vaccinations your 
puppy really needs, see Chapter 16.)
Canine parvovirus is a quick-spreading, highly contagious viral 
disease that comes in two forms: enteric (diarrheal) and myocar-
dial (affecting the heart). Young puppies are particularly vulnerable,
and the disease often is fatal. Distemper is also a virus that spreads
quickly and is highly contagious. In advanced stages, distemper
affects the brain and can cause permanent neurological damage 
and often death. Distemper is the principal cause of disease and
death in unvaccinated dogs.
In addition to a lifetime of regular veterinary care and vaccinations,
you need to spend some of your hard-earned cash on supplies. Dogs
need food — probably your most significant expense, all told — 
as well as feeding supplies, collars and leashes, dens (a crate or
kennel), chew toys, and a number of other necessities and luxuries
(see Chapter 8 for a major discussion on Dachshund necessities and
accessories).
So how much money are we talking? Consider the theoretical break-
down of expenses shown in Table 1-1. Although expenses can vary
dramatically from region to region, I list the approximate costs
somewhere in the middle of the extremes. I also assume that you’ll
buy your puppy from a good breeder for an average price of $600

Sure, you can cut corners here and there, but if you have to cut so
many corners that you compromise the health and welfare of your
dog — or if you aren’t willing to spend money on your pet because
he’s “just a dog” — perhaps you should reconsider bringing a dog
into your life right now. Dogs deserve proper care and a comfort-
able existence just like you do.
The Size of Love: Standards 
versus Minis
A Dachshund decision you need to consider is what size will 
work best for you. Dachshunds come in two sizes — Standard 
and Miniature — according to the official breed standard pub-
lished by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel 
Chapter 1: Is a Dachshund Right for You? 19

Club. Although the AKC doesn’t officially consider the two sizes 
as separate classifications, the sizes are divided by weight for the
purpose of competition:
Miniatures are 11 pounds and under at 12 months of age and
older; Standards are over 11 pounds, usually falling between 
16 and 32 pounds.
Unofficially, many people call Dachshunds between 11 and 16
pounds tweenies, because they’re between the two preferred
Dachshund sizes. Tweenies may not be preferable in the show 
ring, but they’re just as good as the larger Standards and the 
smaller Miniatures as pets. Some pet owners even prefer the
medium size.
In Europe, Dachshunds officially fall into three sizes: Standard,
Miniature, and Rabbit. These sizes are determined not by weight,
but by chest circumference. Rabbits are what Americans would
consider the smallest Miniatures.
What size suits your fancy? Maybe you’ve seen only Standard
Dachshunds, or you like a sturdier dog. Maybe your heart melts 
at the sight of a Mini pup, and you can’t wait to hold one in the palm
of your hand. Maybe you aren’t sure. No matter what, Dachshunds
are a surprisingly sturdy dog and tend to believe they’re much
bigger than they are. Here are some general considerations:
 If you live in an apartment or a house without a fenced-in yard,
a Miniature Dachshund may be best for you. Smaller dogs can
fulfill much of their exercise needs inside the house.
 Minis may need more help with stairs and ledges because
every jump is bigger for them than for a Standard, and they’re
just as prone to disk disease.
 If you like the idea of participating in outdoor activities 
with your Dachshund — things like hiking or long walks, 
for example — you may want to consider a Standard. I’m 
not saying Minis can’t go on walks. On the contrary, they 
have a lot of energy and love to exercise. They may not be
able to keep up with your fast strides, however. Remember
how short their legs are!
The size matter is largely a personal one. Some people just like
smaller or larger dogs — although Standards can hardly be consid-
ered large, even at their biggest and most roly-poly. Whatever size
you choose, a Dachshund is a Dachshund — challenging and fun, full
of mischief, and brimming with love for you (yes, even when he tips
over that trash can). A Dachshund wants only your care, loving
authority, and devoted attention in return.

Are You Ready to Be Owned 
by a Dachsie?
I can almost hear you: “Yes, yes, I’m ready to own a Dachshund!
Sure, Dachshunds have minds of their own, but I can handle one.
How tough could it be with a dog that short?” Ah, but Napoleon

Count up all your responses. If you answered mostly As, you may
not be ready for a Dachshund. Your ideas of what a dog should be
and do may be better fulfilled with another breed. Of course, to
grasp that special Dachshund mode of thinking, you may just 
need to give this book a once-through and then try the quiz 
again. Converts abound.
If you answered mostly Bs, you’re already talkin’ Dachsie. You
already know, or can guess at, what life will be like with a Dachshund
in the house. Challenging? Yes. Fun? Oh, yes. Easy? Oh, no! But as
long as you know what you’re getting into and are ready to trade 
in the easy parts for some great fun, you may be just the kind of
companion a Dachshund needs.
And as for Number 15: Although the answer is F (all the above),
you will be tops on your Dachshund’s list.
Chapter 1: Is a Dachshund Right for You? 23
Body of a hot dog; eye of a tiger
Dachshunds are big fans of adults (although not necessarily strangers), well-behaved
children, other Dachshunds, and often other dogs. A Dachshund may even befriend
the family cat. Everything else, however, is quite literally “fair game.” Neighborhood
cats, rabbits, squirrels, birds, field mice, hamsters, and other small animals look like
prey to your Dachshund. And being bred to hunt, a Dachshund will pursue.

Chapter 2
Defining the Dashing
Dachshund
In This Chapter
 Understanding why Dachshunds look like they do
 Reviewing the Dachsie body
 Exploring the AKC’s breed standard
You know one when you see one. You can easily describe one.
But can you actually define what a Dachshund is? If you read
this chapter, you’ll be able to do just that.
The definition of a breed can mean several things. For example, 
it can mean the breed standard, which is (and this is a mouthful) 
a description of the nonexistent, ideal specimen of a particular
breed, against which actual dogs of the breed are measured for 
the purposes of improving the breed through breeding programs
and for judging the conformation of dogs in dog shows. The defini-
tion can also mean, simply, the qualities that make a breed unique. 
I cover both definitions throughout this chapter.
Hey, Who Stretched Out My Dog?
If you ask anyone on the street to describe a Dachshund, chances
are you’ll get some version of “those long dogs,” “those wiener-
shaped dogs,” or “those short, stretched-out dogs.” Most people
know Dachshunds have unusually short legs and unusually long
bodies (see Figure 2-1). But why on earth would anyone try to
“make” a dog like that?
Dachshund-shaped dogs are nothing new. Some historians claim
that the Dachshund shape existed 4,000+ years ago in ancient Egypt.
But the Dachshunds people know and love today were developed

primarily for one purpose: to hunt. The following sections take you
through the Dachshund’s shape and how a Dachshund is meant to
use that unusual body.
Figure 2-1: Short legs and a long body: That’s a dachshund.
The right stuff for hunting
Although they share many features (and plenty of ancestors) with
the Basset Hound, Dachshunds certainly are unique. Lighter, smaller,
finer-boned, and quicker than their Basset cousins (although some
sources say that, originally, the Dachshund was the larger of the two
breeds), Dachshunds can fit into places a Basset can’t, and they 
usually can move with greater agility.
Dachshunds also have a keen scenting ability, facilitated by their low
stance and long ears. But it’s the Dachshund personality that’s even
more highly prized. Their energy, eagerness, and Terrier-like feisti-
ness in the pursuit of small game have historically distinguished
Dachshunds as excellent hunting companions.
Why Dachshunds have long bodies
The Dachshund’s long body is unusual but useful for its original 
purpose: hunting. Dachshunds had to be large enough to contend
with badgers and other game that could put up a fierce counterat-
tack. On the other hand, Dachshunds had to be low to the ground
and compact to be able to follow the badger into its burrow without
getting stuck. The Dachshund’s long, slender body was the 
perfect solution. Adding length gave the dog more power and weight
while maintaining its low height.

At first, the Dachshund’s long body may seem more of an impedi-
ment to agile movement, but Dachshunds are surprisingly lithe and
light-footed. Their spines are flexible (although they don’t respond
well to sudden movements, hard jolts, or twists — see Chapter 17).
And although Dachshunds are a fairly deep-chested breed, their
bodies are perfect for wriggling. If you have a Dachshund at home,
you’ve probably already seen this wriggling as your Dachshund
slyly makes her way to the foot of your bed underneath the covers.
Why Dachshunds have short legs
Another distinguishing feature of the Dachshund is its short legs.
Dachshunds have short legs to best fit into badger dens and bur-
rows of other small game. But Dachshunds have been used for all
sorts of hunting, not just burrowing, and its characteristically
short legs serve the Dachshund well in several ways:
 Short legs allow a Dachshund to move quickly through dense
brush and into spaces that, even though above ground, would
be tight fits for a taller dog. In fact, Dachshunds have been used
to flush out wild boar, because after the boar is on the loose, the
Dachshunds can hide, protected, under the dense underbrush.
 Underground, the Dachshund’s short legs allow her to maneu-
ver well in a burrow. If the game being pursued turns to attack,
short legs allow the Dachshund to back up.
 The Dachshund’s compact legs serve as powerful excavators.
Dachshunds can dig out anything and dig into or out of 
anywhere.
 A Dachshund’s short legs keep her closer to the ground 
and enhance her ability to catch and follow a scent
Chapter 2: Defining the Dashing Dachshund 27
How breeds are “made”
All purebred dogs are made, to some extent. A tiny Chihuahua and a giant Tibetan Mastiff
are both variations on the same theme, created by humans through selective breeding
to serve a specific purpose. Dachshunds, too, were designed to serve a specific 
purpose: to follow a badger, or other burrowing game, into its tunnel and flush it out or
bark to alert an accompanying human of its whereabouts. German hunters probably
crossed short-legged, long-bodied French hounds like Basset Hounds and Beagles with
Terriers that liked to dig underground and chase vermin, although nobody knows for
sure. We do know they developed Miniature Dachshunds during the 1800s by crossing
in smaller dogs and breeding the smallest Dachshunds together, specifically for 
hunting purposes, too. The Mini’s tiny body could fit into even smaller holes in pursuit of
small game. Of course, the Minis also made (and still make) charming lap dogs, too.

Dachshund Anatomy 101
Although the Dachshund’s unusual form makes it an ideal hunting
dog, and many Dachsies are still used for this purpose (see the pre-
vious section), the Dachshund’s more common role today is one of
companion, friend, and resident court jester. But the Dachshund’s
unusual shape is worth understanding even if you don’t plan to 
hunt a day in your life. Knowing your Dachsie’s anatomy will help
you understand her health needs and prevent or prepare for 
potential problems.
Talking dog anatomy means using plenty of terms that many folks
may not be familiar with, so Figure 2-2 shows a boy Dachshund with
all his parts labeled. And following is a list — a mini Dachs-tionary —
that defines the anatomical terms shown in the figure.
This Dachs-tionary comes in mighty handy when you’re reading
the section “Evaluating the Perfect Dachsie.”
 Cheek: The fleshy area behind the corners of a Dachshund’s
mouth.
 Muzzle: The part of the dog’s head in front of the eyes, 
including the nose and jaws.
 Stop: The place where the muzzle meets the skull.
 Skull: The head bone, of course.
 Crest: The back of the skull where it begins its descent.
 Neck: The area attaching the head to the shoulders and 
upper chest.
 Withers: The highest point of the dog’s shoulder blades, 
used to measure a Dachshund’s height.
 Back: The top of the dog, from withers to tail.
 Loin: The section of the dog between the ribs and hipbones.
 Rump: The area above the hipbones, in front of the base of
the tail.
 Hock: The joint on the rear legs between the second thigh and
the metatarsus (the area between the heel and toes, or rear
pastern), corresponding to the human heel. In a Dachshund,
this joint sticks out from behind.
 Toes: The digits at the ends of the paws.
 Stifle: The dog’s knee — the first leg joint between the thigh
and what’s called the second thigh (see “Hock”).
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
28

 Elbow: The joint between the front arm and forearm.
 Forearm: The lower part of the front leg, between the elbow
and wrist. In a Dachshund, the forearm should be relatively
straight but comfortably shaped around the chest.
 Dewclaw: A functionless fifth toe, which is often — but not
necessarily — removed.
 Pastern: The area of the foot between the wrist and the toes.
 Wrist: The joint between the forearm and the toes.
 Shoulder: The top end of the front legs, connecting the legs 
to the body.

Evaluating the Perfect Dachsie
The American Kennel Club publishes a standard for the
Dachshund that was developed by the Dachshund Club of America,
Inc. (DCA), and that defines and describes — in great detail — the
ideal Dachshund. Every so often, this standard has been updated 
to further improve the breed. The most recent revision officially took
effect in March 2007, the first change to the standard since 1992.
Of course, what’s ideal for one person may not be ideal for all people.
But the breed standard has a specific purpose for all Dachsie lovers:

so that they don’t bring puppies into the world with faults

(some with serious consequences, and others with mostly
cosmetic faults). The standard can further the good health
and good looks of the Dachshund breed.
 The standard serves as a guide for dog-show judges, who 
are judging, in essence, the work of the breeders. Judges 
in dog shows measure each Dachshund they see against 
an imaginary perfect Dachshund, and the dogs that come 
closest to the ideal do the best in competitions. (Chapter 15
goes into greater detail about competitions your Dachshund
could enter.)
 Some aspects of the breed standard detail important qualities
that happen to be particularly relevant for pet owners. For
instance, the breed standard says that a Dachshund should
appear “neither crippled, awkward, nor cramped in his capac-
ity for movement” and that his temperament should be “clever,
lively, and courageous . . .”. In other words, a sound body and
mind make for a wonderful pet as well as a technically correct
Dachshund.
That said, some people do like to know that their dogs are as close
to perfect as possible. And, because it never hurts to understand the
ideal for your breed, this section goes over the AKC breed standard
for the Dachshund in detail. The standard is largely based around
qualities that ensure good health and the betterment of the breed
(the goals of any good breeder). For more on all the characteristics
of a Dachshund, jump over to Chapter 3.
Don’t be too critical of your beloved pet if she doesn’t fit the 
breed standard very well. Who cares if your Dachshund’s eyes 
aren’t perfectly “almond-shaped and dark-rimmed,” if your smooth
Dachshund’s coat is a little too thick, or if your Standard Dachshund
is the biggest one you’ve ever seen; she can still be the most perfect
pet you’ve ever had. Plenty of love, attention, and care — coupled
with proper management and training — are the things that make 
a good pet, not the perfect coat texture or profile.
Reviewing the AKC’s official 
breed standard
The AKC’s official Dachshund breed standard was approved on
January 9, 2007, and became effective on March 1, 2007. Here it 
is, divided into a few specific categories.
 General Appearance: Low to ground, long in body and short 
of leg with robust muscular development. The skin is elastic
and pliable without excessive wrinkling. Appearing neither
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
30

crippled, awkward, nor cramped in her capacity for movement,
the Dachshund is well balanced with bold and confident head
carriage and intelligent, alert facial expression. Her hunting
spirit, good nose, loud tongue, and distinctive build make her
well suited for below-ground work and for beating the bush.
Her keen nose gives her an advantage over most other breeds
for trailing. Note: Inasmuch as the Dachshund is a hunting dog,
scars from honorable wounds shall not be considered a fault.
 Size, Proportion, Substance: Bred and shown in two sizes,
Standard and Miniature, Miniatures aren’t a separate classifica-
tion but compete in a class division for “11 pounds and under
at 12 months of age and older.” Weight of the Standard size is
usually between 16 and 32 pounds.
 Head: Viewed from above or from the side, the head tapers
uniformly to the tip of the nose. The eyes are of medium size,
almond-shaped, and dark-rimmed, with an energetic, pleasant
expression; not piercing; and very dark in color. The bridge
bones over the eyes are strongly prominent. Wall eyes, except
in the case of dappled dogs (see the following section), are 
a serious fault. The ears are set near the top of the head, not
too far forward; of moderate length, rounded; not narrow,
pointed, or folded. Their carriage, when animated, is with the
forward edge just touching the cheek so that the ears frame
the face. The skull is slightly arched, neither too broad nor
too narrow, and slopes gradually with little perceptible stop
into the finely formed, slightly arched muzzle, giving a Roman
appearance. Lips are tightly stretched, well covering the lower
jaw. Nostrils well open. Jaws opening wide and hinged well
back of the eyes, with strongly developed bones and teeth.
 Teeth: Powerful canine teeth; teeth fit closely together in a
scissors bite. An even bite is a minor fault. Any other deviation
is a serious fault.
Different breeds have different bites. In other words, their
upper and lower jaws and teeth meet in different ways. In many
breeds, including Dachshunds, a scissors bite is the preferred
bite. In this bite, the outside of the lower teeth touches the
inner side of the upper teeth when the dog’s mouth is closed. 
In an even bite, also called a level bite, the top and bottom 
teeth meet with no overlapping.
 Neck: Long, muscular clean-cut, without dewlap, slightly
arched in the nape, flowing gracefully into the shoulders 
without creating the impression of a right angle.
The dewlap is the name for loose, pendulous skin that hangs
down from a dog’s throat and neck. Dachshunds shouldn’t
have one.
Chapter 2: Defining the Dashing Dachshund 31

 Trunk: Long and fully muscled. When viewed in profile, the
back lies in the straightest possible line between the withers
and the short, very slightly arched loin. A body that hangs
loosely between the shoulders is a serious fault.
 Abdomen: Slightly drawn up.
 Forequarters: For effective underground work, the front 
must be strong, deep, long, and cleanly muscled.
 Forequarters in detail, Chest: The breastbone is strongly
prominent in front so that on either side a depression or dimple
appears. When viewed from the front, the thorax appears oval
and extends downward to the mid-point of the forearm. The
enclosing structure of the well-sprung ribs appears full and 
oval to allow, by its ample capacity, complete development of
heart and lungs. The keel merges gradually into the line of the
abdomen and extends well beyond the front legs. Viewed in
profile, the lowest point of the breast line is covered by the
front leg.
The keel is the outline of the lower chest (in profile), stretching
from the top of the breastbone to the bottom of the ribs.
 Forequarters in detail, Shoulder Blades: Long, broad, well laid-
back and firmly placed upon the fully developed thorax; closely
fitted at the withers; furnished with hard yet pliable muscles.
 Forequarters in detail, Upper Arm: Ideally the same length as
the shoulder blade and at right angles to the latter; strong of
bone and hard of muscle; lying close to the ribs, with elbows
close to the body, yet capable of free movement.
 Forequarters in detail, Forearm: Short in stature; supplied
with hard yet pliable muscles on the front and outside, with
tightly stretched tendons on the inside at the back, slightly
curved inward. The joints between the forearms and the feet
(wrists) are closer together than the shoulder joints, so that
the front doesn’t appear absolutely straight. The inclined
shoulder blades, upper arms, and curved forearms form
parentheses that enclose the ribcage, creating the correct
“wraparound front.” Knuckling over is a disqualifying fault.
Knuckling over refers to a faulty wrist joint that flexes 
forward when a dog stands. Knuckling over is a serious fault 
in Dachshunds. It weakens what should be strong front legs 
and disqualifies any Dachshund from the show ring.
 Forequarters in detail, Feet: Front paws are full, tight, com-
pact, with well-arched toes and tough, thick pads. They may 
be equally inclined a trifle outward. There are five toes — four
in use — close together with a pronounced arch and strong,
short nails. Front dewclaws may be removed.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
32

 Hindquarters: Strong and cleanly muscled. The pelvis, 
the thigh, the second thigh, and the rear pastern are ideally
the same length and give the appearance of a series of right
angles. From the rear, the thighs are strong and powerful. 
The legs turn neither in nor out.
 Hindquarters in detail, Rear Pasterns: Short and strong, 
perpendicular to the second thigh bone. When viewed from
behind, they’re upright and parallel.
 Hindquarters in detail, Feet/Hind Paws: Smaller than the
front paws, with four compactly closed and arched toes with
tough, thick pads. The entire foot points straight ahead and is
balanced equally on the ball and not merely on the toes. Rear
dewclaws should be removed.
 Hindquarters in detail, Croup: Long rounded and full, sinking
slightly toward the tail.
The croup is the entire pelvic girdle region.
 Hindquarters in detail, Tail: Set in continuation of the spine,
extending without kinks, twists, or pronounced curvature; not
carried too gaily.
 Gait: Fluid and smooth. Forelegs reach well forward, without
much lift, in unison with the driving action of the hind legs. 
The correct shoulder assembly and well-fitted elbows allow the
long, free stride in front. Viewed from the front, the legs don’t
move in exact parallel planes, but incline slightly inward. Hind
legs drive on a line with the forelegs, with the hock joints and
rear pasterns turning neither in nor out. The propulsion of the
hind leg depends on the dog’s ability to carry the hind leg to
complete extension.
Viewed in profile, the forward reach of the hind leg equals the
rear extension. The thrust of correct movement is seen when
the rear pads are clearly exposed during rear extension. Rear
feet don’t reach upward toward the abdomen and there is no
appearance of walking on the rear pasterns. Feet must travel
parallel to the line of motion with no tendency to swing out,
cross over, or interfere with each other. Short, choppy move-
ment, rolling or high-stepping gait, and close or overly wide
coming or going are incorrect.
The Dachshund must have agility, freedom of movement, 
and endurance to do the work for which she was developed.
 Temperament: The Dachshund is clever, lively, and coura-
geous to the point of rashness, persevering in above- and
below-ground work, with all the senses well developed. Any
display of shyness is a serious fault.
Chapter 2: Defining the Dashing Dachshund 33

The most important things to worry about with a Dachshund are
temperament and health. Buying a Dachshund from a breeder can
be a good move, because good breeders breed that classic friendly,
funny, brave Dachshund temperament. They also want dogs that
are sound and free of health problems. For the average pet owner,
those are the really important priorities.
Brushing over special characteristics
of the coat varieties
The Dachshund is bred with three varieties of coat — smooth, wire-
haired, and longhaired — and is shown in two sizes — Standard and
Miniature. All three varieties and both sizes must conform to the
characteristics specified in the previous section. The features in 
the following sections are applicable for each variety.
Smooth Dachshunds
Here are the defining characteristics of the smooth Dachshund:
Coat: Short, smooth and shining. Should be neither too long 
nor too thick. Ears not leathery.
Tail: Gradually tapered to a point; not too richly haired. Long, sleek
bristles on the underside are considered a patch of strong-growing
hair, not a fault. A brush tail is a fault, as is a partly or wholly 
hairless tail.
A brush tail is a tail that’s bushy and heavy with hair. Dachshunds
shouldn’t have one.
Color of hair: Although base color is immaterial, certain patterns
and basic colors predominate. One-colored Dachshunds include red
and cream, with or without a shading of interspersed dark hairs. A
small amount of white on the chest is acceptable, but not desirable.
Nose and nails: Black.
Two-colored Dachshunds
The two-colored smooth coat variety includes black, chocolate, 
wild boar, gray (blue), and fawn (Isabella). Each has deep, rich tan or
cream markings over the eyes, on the sides of the jaw and underlip,
on the inner edge of the ear, front, breast, inside and behind the front
legs, on the paws and around the anus, and from the anus to about
one-third to one-half the length of the tail on the underside. Undue
prominence or extreme lightness of tan markings is undesirable. A
small amount of white on the chest is acceptable, but not desirable.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
34

Dachshund colors, such as red or black, are easy to picture, but
other colors are less well known. Wild boar is more common on
wirehaired Dachshunds but can also occur on smooths. It refers to 
a black or dark outer coat over a lighter-colored undercoat. Isabella
is a fancy word for a fawn color. Some two-color Dachshunds are
fawn with tan markings, called Isabella and tan.
The nose and nails for two-colored dachshunds are as follows: 
in the case of black dogs, the two are black; for chocolate and all
other colors, dark brown, but self-colored is acceptable.
Dappled Dachshunds
The dapple (merle) pattern is expressed as lighter-colored areas 
contrasting with the darker base color, which may be any acceptable
color. Neither the light nor the dark color should predominate. The
nose and nails are the same as for one- and two-colored Dachshunds.
Partial or wholly blue (wall) eyes are as acceptable as dark eyes. A
large area of white on the chest of a dapple is permissible.
Brindle is a pattern (as opposed to a color) in which black or dark
stripes occur over the entire body, although in some specimens
the pattern may be visible only in the tan points.
The sable pattern consists of a uniform dark overlay on red dogs.
The overlay hairs are double-pigmented, with the tip of each hair
much darker than the base color. The pattern usually displays a
widow’s peak on the head. The nose, nails, and eye rims are black.
Eyes are dark — the darker the better.
Wirehaired Dachshunds
Here are the defining characteristics of the wirehair Dachshund:
Chapter 2: Defining the Dashing Dachshund 35
Colors voted out
Double-dappled Dachshunds are dappled Dachshunds with an additional sprinkling
of pure white patches. This used to be an allowed pattern in the breed standard,
but unusual and interesting as they may appear, double dapples are associated with
multiple health problems. In 2007, the Dachshund Club of America voted to remove
the double-dappled pattern from the standard.
Piebald Dachshunds are white with large spots of any color; this color pattern also
isn’t allowed in the breed standard. The Dachshund Club of America voted to add it
in 2007, but the motion failed, with 316 votes for and 431 against.

Coat: With the exception of the jaw, eyebrows, and ears, the whole
body is covered with a uniform tight, short, thick, rough, hard, outer
coat, but with finer, somewhat softer, shorter hairs (undercoat) dis-
tributed between the coarser hairs. The absence of an undercoat is
a fault. The distinctive facial furnishings include a beard and eye-
brows. On the ears, the hair is shorter than on the body, almost
smooth.
The general arrangement of the hair is such that the wirehaired
Dachshund, when viewed from a distance, resembles the smooth.
Any sort of soft hair in the outer coat, wherever found on the 
body — especially on the top of the head — is a fault. The same 
is true of long, curly, or wavy hair, or hair that sticks out irregularly
in all directions.
Tail: Robust, thickly haired, gradually tapering to a point. A flag 
tail is a fault.
A flag tail is a relatively long tail carried high, with feathering on 
it. Dachshunds shouldn’t have one.
Color of hair: Although the most common colors are wild boar,
black and tan, and various shades of red, all colors and patterns
listed in the smooth hair section are admissible. Wild boar appears
as banding of the individual hairs and imparts an overall grizzled
effect, which is most often seen on wirehaired Dachshunds but
may also appear on other coats. Tan points may or may not be 
evident. Variations include red boar and chocolate-and-tan boar.
A small amount of white on the chest, although acceptable, 
isn’t desirable.
Nose and nails: Same as for the smooth variety in most cases. Nose,
nails, and eye rims are black on wild-boar and red-boar Dachshunds.
On chocolate-and-tan-boar Dachshunds, nose, nails, eye rims, and
eyes are self-colored — the darker the better.
Longhaired Dachshunds
Here are the defining characteristics of the longhaired Dachshund:
Coat: The sleek, glistening, often slightly wavy hair is longer under
the neck and on the forechest, the underside of the body, the ears,
and behind the legs. The coat gives the dog an elegant appearance.
Short hair on the ear isn’t desirable. Too profuse a coat — which
masks type — equally long hair over the whole body, a curly coat,
and a pronounced parting on the back are all faults.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
36

Tail: Carried gracefully in prolongation of the spine; the hair attains
its greatest length here and forms a veritable flag.
Color of hair: Same as for the smooth Dachshund variety.
Nose and nails: Same as for the smooth variety.

 Deciding how much dog you need
 Picking out your favorite coat
 Settling on a color and pattern
 Choosing a boy or a girl (or boy and girl)
O
ne of the great things about bringing home a Dachshund is 
that you have so many options: Big or small; longhaired, short-
haired, or wirehaired; and plenty of colors to choose from, too. Do
you want a boy or a girl? A puppy or an older dog? You have some
important choices ahead of you, and you need to think about some
issues and weigh some options before you can choose the Dachsie
that best suits your life. This chapter will help you consider your
options. I also help shed some light on which Dachshund differences
don’t really make any, well, difference, as well as those options that
can make all the difference in the world.
The bottom line when choosing your new family member? All the
cosmetic considerations don’t really matter that much (assuming
you aren’t planning on breeding/showing your dog). Health and 
temperament, health and temperament, health and temperament are
what matter. Make that your mantra as you visit breeders and meet
puppies and their parents (see Chapter 4). The best dogs have two
healthy parents — better yet, four healthy grandparents as well.
They’re raised in a family home by a breeder who makes an effort 
to socialize them. They’re given proper medical care from the begin-
ning of their lives and are bred to exhibit the classic Dachshund 
personality: fun, funny, feisty, fearless, and fantastic (see Chapter 2).
Need I say more?

Size Matters(Or Does It?)
When it comes to Dachshunds, size does matter — at least in some
ways. By North American standards, Dachshunds come in two sizes:
Standard and Miniature, as shown in Figure 3-1. Dachshunds that fall
right in between the Miniature and Standard weights are unofficially
called tweenies by some. Sizes are divided according to weight, 
not height.
By European standards, Dachshunds come in three sizes: Standard,
Miniature, and Rabbit; the Rabbits, the smallest size, are approxi-
mately equivalent to a Miniature Dachshund, and sizes are 
distinguished by chest circumference rather than weight.
Figure 3-1: A Standard and a Miniature Dachshund, in their model poses.
But what difference does size really make? It depends. Standards
and Minis were bred differently, and their personalities and needs,
although similar, aren’t interchangeable. Also, one size may fit your
lifestyle better than another.
The following sections run down the differences between micro- 
and macro-wiener dogs (and those that fall somewhere in between).
But before you dive into the details, take a minute to answer some
questions to get a feel for which Dachshund size may best suit you.
Determining your size match 
before you get the details
Answering the following questions may help you decide which
type of size to focus on in your search for a new pup:
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
40

1. When you imagine yourself bonding with your new
Dachshund puppy, what qualities do you picture 
yourself treasuring most?
A. Energy, playfulness, and the Romp Factor.
B. The clowning, the hilarity of the big watchdog in 
a little package, and, of course, the Cute-as-a-
Button Factor.
C. The combination of independent thinker and devoted
companion.
2. The quality you’re least looking forward to dealing with
in your new Dachshund is
A. Shedding — you can’t stand the thought of dog hair
everywhere.
B. Barking — shrill noises really get to you.
C. Housetraining — yuck. There’s nothing worse than
cleaning up a dog mess.
3. The other members of your family include
A. Kids under 5.
B. One other adult.
C. Another dog and/or a cat.
4. You live
A. On a farm.
B. In an apartment.
C. In a house with a fenced backyard.
5. Your activity level is
A. Pretty high. You like to go on walks, and you like 
to keep moving. You wonder, “Can Dachshunds catch
a Frisbee?”
B. Pretty low. You’re housebound or can’t move too
quickly, for whatever reason. Or maybe you just don’t
like to move more than you have to!
C. About average. You plan to walk your dog every day,
but you’re no athlete.
6. Your house has
A. Plenty of high places — high couches, steep stairs,
high beds, and so on.
Chapter 3: The Long and Short of Dachshund Varieties 41

B. Plenty of low and level places — futon beds and
couches, for example, but no stairs.
C. Some high places and some low places, but the high
places and steep stairs can be modified if necessary
with ramps or some obstacles.
7. You worry most about
A. The costs associated with your Dachshund. You’re
willing to do what it takes, but you wonder, “How
much is this going to run me, anyway?” (Check out
Chapter 8 for some common Dachsie expenses.)
B. Accidentally injuring your Dachshund. “They look 
so delicate.”
C. Training your Dachshund. You’ve heard the breed 
is pretty darned stubborn.
8. Above all, you’re looking for
A. A playmate that can really play. “No wimpy, sissy
dogs for me!”
B. A precious little lap dog to dote on and spoil.
C. A companion to be with you throughout your days
and nights, sharing your life as much as possible.
Now, tally up how many As, Bs, and Cs you have. If you have mostly
As, a Standard is probably the dog for you. Mostly Bs? Consider a
Miniature. If your tally is heavy on the Cs, it probably doesn’t matter
what size you choose. Any size, including tweenies, will work for
you, because you’re just glad to have a Dachshund, period.
But each of the preceding questions brings up some specific issues,
so you need to look closely at each size, one at a time. Pay particular
attention to the size that interests you the most, according to the
quiz. If size truly doesn’t matter to you, read all three of the follow-
ing sections to prepare for any type of dog may you end up with.
In general, your preference for a Standard or a Mini is largely a
matter of personal taste, but if you aren’t sure, visit several breeders
and meet plenty of Dachsies. One size or the other will probably
capture your heart.
If your main concern is to have a dog with the classic Dachshund
personality — an independent and devoted Dachsie, a clown, 
a chow hound, a dog that’s full of mischief and love — it really 
doesn’t matter which size you choose. All sizes reflect the classic
Dachshund personality. But other issues beyond personality may
concern you. Read on to discover how other factors may impact
your decision.

The Standard Dachshund
Standards are bigger and more boisterous than Miniatures; they 
can keep up with you on a walk a little more easily; and they can
probably run farther and play harder than most Minis, too. That’s
not to say that Minis aren’t little balls of Dachshund dynamite. 
But the larger size of the Standard (although keep in mind that 
even Standards aren’t all that big compared to, say, a Labrador
Retriever) may be better suited for a very active lifestyle.
You need to consider a few things with a Standard Dachshund:
 Because they’re bigger, Standards will leave more dog hair on
the furniture, although having a Standard Dachshund around
is nothing like having a large dog when it comes to shedding.
A daily brush-through helps a lot (for more on grooming, see
Chapter 16).
 Standards typically are great with other dogs and with 
kids, although all children should learn how to treat a dog 
and should be instructed in the proper way to pick up a
Dachshund. This is important in order to avoid causing 
a back injury (see Chapter 17).
 Standards need more room to exercise than Minis. Standards
do best with a daily walk or two and some time to romp in a
fenced backyard — and I mean fenced well. “Earth dog” isn’t 
a misnomer when it comes to Dachsies. They love to dig and
dig and dig, and the bigger, stronger Standards are most effi-
cient at burrowing their way out of a yard that you thought 
was secure (although many Minis excel at digging, too).
 Standards cost more to feed than Minis because they’re larger,
but still, a 30-pound dog doesn’t eat too much (see Chapter 8).
Chapter 3: The Long and Short of Dachshund Varieties 43
Kids and Dachshunds
Kids and Dachshunds are made for each other — especially when the Dachshund 
is the more durable Standard size (Miniature Dachshunds can be too small and frag-
ile for very young children). Encourage your children to take an active part in the care,
socialization, and training of your Dachshund. Draw up a feeding schedule and let your
kids measure out or prepare the dog food. Make walks a family affair. Look for local
puppy- or dog-training courses for kids. If your child is a natural, he or she can even
compete as a junior handler in a dog show. (Contact your local dog club or the AKC for
info on how to become a junior handler. Chapter 19 contains the AKC’s contact info.)

The Miniature Dachshund
All Dachshunds are clowns, but there’s something particularly 
hilarious about the antics of the Miniature Dachshund. Of course,
that may depend on your sense of humor. Small-dog aficionados are
particularly charmed by the Mini’s attitude, obstinacy, independ-
ence, and over-confident, rapid-fire barks. And, of course, if you 
love small dogs, a Mini Dachshund really is as cute as they come.
Love cats? Miniature Dachshunds make great cat companions — 
as long as you introduce the two carefully and give each pet its
space until they accept each other. Some people with successful 
cat-Dachshund households claim that it helps if the Dachshund is
second on the scene. If the cat has the home-field advantage, the
Dachshund puppy is more likely to afford his new feline housemate
the respect she deserves.
Not everyone is fond of Minis, however. Although their personalities
are essentially the same as the Standard’s, a few differences exist.
Here are some unique Mini characteristics:
 Minis bark, and their bark can be shrill (particularly the long-
haired Minis). If you’ve had Toy dogs in the past, you know
that many of them like to bark. Perhaps they compensate in
volume for what they lack in size. Perhaps they want to make
sure that you see them. Whatever the reason, if you really,
really hate barking, you may be better off with a Standard
(although all Dachshunds like to bark, really).
 If you have young children, you’re probably better off with a
Standard. Children under 5 (some breeders even say under age
10) usually aren’t able to understand how to properly treat a
dog, and a very small dog can get injured if it’s dropped, fallen
on, or pushed.
Likewise, Minis like to be the center of attention and don’t
take kindly to poking, prodding, and pulling. Small dogs can
injure a small child if they lose patience and decide to snap at
those curious fingers (or that inquisitive face). Parents should
never leave dogs and small children together unsupervised.
Miniature Dachshund puppies are very small, and although
they can act pretty feisty, they’re much more fragile than a
Standard-sized puppy. If you have a Mini puppy around, watch
where you step, watch where you sit, and always put the puppy
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
44

firmly onto the ground after holding him. Letting him jump out
of your arms can result in a back injury or even a broken leg. 
It has happened.
 The Miniature Dachshund’s size makes it particularly suited
to life in an apartment or a small house. When paper-trained,
a Mini Dachshund doesn’t necessarily even need to go outside
at all, which is an advantage for people who are housebound
or who live somewhere that makes forays outdoors inconven-
ient (such as in a high rise). Minis get plenty of exercise dash-
ing around the house, so you don’t need to feel guilty if you
can’t quite muster a daily walk.
A big thing to consider if you have a Mini is the layout of your
home. If you have a lot of stairs, be prepared to cart your Mini
up and down. Too much stair walking, especially if the risers
are steep, can be dangerous for your Mini’s back. Stairs are no
picnic for a Standard Dachsie, either, but the back strain is less
severe. You should also try to keep your Mini from jumping
down off tall beds, chairs, and couches. Consider ramps made
for dogs.
 If cost is a concern, Minis cost less to feed, and vet bills may be
lower because the Mini’s small size requires less medication.
Do I have a tweeny?
You may want to consider what some breeders and fanciers are 
calling tweenies — especially if you like a smaller dog but are intimi-
dated by the very small size of a Mini. Tweenies don’t exactly fit into
the breed standard for show dogs (see Chapter 2). They aren’t big
enough to be Standards or small enough to be Minis. But as a pet,
the tweeny is a wonderful size — not too heavy, not too fragile.
Pick a Coat, Any Coat
Dachshunds come in three coat varieties: smooth, longhaired, and
wirehaired, as shown in Figure 3-2. Coat type makes a difference.
Each type has different grooming needs and subtle differences in
personality. You may have picked which coat you like best at first
glance, but read this section to make sure that you’re prepared for
the necessary responsibilities.
Chapter 3: The Long and Short of Dachshund Varieties 45

Figure 3-2: The many coats of the Dachshund.
Smooth Dachshunds
The smooth Dachshund is the quintessential Dachshund. If you 
say Dachshund, the smooth is what most people picture. The sleek,
shiny coat best shows off the Dachshund’s form, and grooming takes
little effort — an occasional brush along with regular nail clipping
and teeth scrubbing (see Chapter 16.)
When it comes to personality, the smooth is similarly representative.
Breeders like to describe the smooth as the most consistent person-
ality type, and many agree that the smooth is the most Dachshund-
like. Incomparable to any other breed, the smooth-coated Dachsie 
is the Dachshund incarnate.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
46
Which coat came first?
Some historical accounts claim that the smooth Dachshund was the original 
version, with the longhaired developing later and the wirehaired developing later
still. Other accounts put the development of the smooth, longhaired, and wirehaired
at about the same time. In any case, all three coats are well established now and
breeders tend to specialize instead of interbreeding the coat types.

Smooths are perfect for people who don’t have the time or patience
for grooming, who love the stereotypical Dachshund look, and who
simply prefer a sleek, short coat. Smooths do shed but don’t notice-
ably drop their coats to grow in new ones (like the longhairs do).
Daily grooming sessions may seem like overkill on your smooth.
Here’s a trick to add some serious sheen to your smooth
Dachshund’s coat: After brushing, rub a drop or two of baby oil 
in your palms and then smooth the oil over your Dachshund’s
coat. Gorgeous!
Longhaired Dachshunds
If you like to groom, or you don’t mind it and think it’s worth the
time to have a dog with a lovely, silky, flowing coat, a longhaired
Dachshund may be the dog for you. Longhairs are beautiful, and a
longhaired Dachshund puppy is totally adorable. But keeping a long-
haired Dachshund requires a significant grooming commitment.
That gorgeous coat will soon become a mess of tangles and mats if
left unattended. And if your dog likes to romp outside, his coat will
pick up leaves, sticks, burrs, and, yes, ticks (see Chapter 16).
During your daily brushing — a requirement — you may feel 
that you’re constantly picking out tangles, but keeping up the task 
is essential. A matted coat can result in skin problems, a more diffi-
cult time with parasite control, and a dog with an unkempt and
sorry appearance. If you aren’t prepared for the commitment, 
please don’t invest in a longhair. Some Dachshund owners find 
the daily grooming session to be a joy.
Longhairs are notoriously sweet, gentle creatures that love to
spend time with their owners. Yours may revel in the attention he
gets from you as you brush, comb, and tend to his personal beauty
routine. Grooming sessions are a great opportunity for you to bond
with your Dachshund, and you’ll feel good about keeping your dog
looking so lovely.
Longhairs were probably developed by blending the Dachshund
with the Cocker Spaniel, and the longhaired Dachsie has something
of the Spaniel about him. Crazy for the hunt, the longhair has the
endurance of a Spaniel in the field. But he’s also crazy for your atten-
tion and loves to cuddle — some people say he’s the mellowest of
the Dachshunds. Longhairs like nothing better than to have you
stroke that long, luxurious coat. You may sometimes wonder if yours
has Velcro under all that hair, because he practically sticks to you!
Chapter 3: The Long and Short of Dachshund Varieties 47

The longhaired Dachshund’s hair isn’t naturally the same length all
over. The longest hair grows on the Dachshund’s underside — on
the throat and chest — as well as on the ears and behind the legs.
You should groom a longhair to accentuate the areas where his hair
is long, smooth, silky, and flowing. However, the longhair should
never look messy; his coat should lie smooth and flat instead of
appearing curly or in any way inelegant.
Wirehaired Dachshunds
If you like Terriers, you’ll love the wirehaired Dachshund. Influenced
by various Terrier stock, the wirehair takes the Terrier characteris-
tics of the Dachshund to the max. Although all Dachsies make great
earth dogs (see Chapter 15), who better to maneuver through the
bracken than a dog with a wiry coat that’s impervious to wind, rain,
burrs, and brush? Add to that the wirehair’s feisty spirit and a bark
that can cow any small creature into submission, and you have a
mighty hunter — not to mention a pet that will keep you laughing.
Wirehairs shed the least of the three coats, but they require a 
fairly extensive grooming regimen several times a year. Their coats
must be stripped — a process in which the loose, dead undercoat is
plucked out to make room for new growth. Some people like to strip
themselves, but others would rather pay groomers. Wirehairs have 
a distinctive look. They’re typically groomed to keep their eyebrows
and beard long. The rest of the coat stays short.
Wirehairs have a distinctive personality. You want to see energy?
Obstinacy? Hilarity? Wirehairs have it all. They’re little extremists —
always on the go, always vocalizing their opinions, and always ready
for a game of catch or a romp around the yard. They’re plenty
cuddly, too, so don’t be surprised to find your wirehair under 
the covers at your feet when you retire for the night.
Choosing from a Rainbow of 
Color and Pattern Options
Color and pattern are subjects of some controversy among
Dachshund lovers, but they probably matter the least in terms 
of choosing your pet. You like red? Black and tan? Cream? Brindle?
Fine. If you find a dog in the color you like, great. Color and pattern
don’t influence personality, so the choice is purely aesthetic.
Dachshunds can come in just about any color typical of dogs and
can also come in several different patterns — and any color can
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
48

occur in any pattern. Wirehairs tend to come in fewer colors, with
one of the more common being a color called wild boar, which
means that the shorter undercoat is lighter and that the longer 
outer coat is black.
Color and pattern are two different things, though. For the sake 
of clarity, check out the following sections for a description of the
colors and patterns that most often occur in Dachshunds.
Spinning the Dachsie color wheel
Dachshunds come in many different colors and color combinations.
(The more typical colors are usually more successful in the show
ring; see Chapter 15). Here’s the color scoop:
 Red (from strawberry blonde to deep chestnut): Some
shades of red look pretty much like brown, but Dachshund
people still call these dogs red.
 Wheaten: This is really just a very light red.
 Cream: Cream Dachshunds can range from gold to almost
white.
 Wild boar: This is a double color common on wirehaired
Dachshunds. The shorter, softer undercoat is lighter in color,
and the longer, dense, wiry outer coat is black.
 Sable: Similar to the wild boar coat, the sable coat is marked
like a black and tan, but up close you can see that under the
black base coat is a layer of red. In some dogs, the tan points
on the face are so exaggerated that they appear to form a
mask around the eyes or a widow’s peak on the forehead.
 Black and tan: This common color combination is found on
many dogs — from Rottweilers and Dobermans to
Chihuahuas. The Dachshund is black with tan points.
 Chocolate and tan: This combo is just like black and tan, 
but the base color is a chocolate-brown color.
 Isabella and tan: A grayish beige or rosy fawn color with 
tan points.
Noticing a marked difference: 
The patterns
From solid to dappled to brindled, Dachshund markings or patterns
have no influence on a dog’s personality — only his appearance.
Chapter 3: The Long and Short of Dachshund Varieties 49

Pick what you like or don’t worry about it at all. The subtleties are
only relevant to breeders and dog-show judges. Here are the many
patterns a Dachshund can wear with pride:
 Solid: A solid color is really an absence of markings rather
than a marking itself. Solid means the whole dog is one color.
The most common solid color is red, followed by wheaten 
and cream.
 Solid with points: Black, chocolate, fawn, and Isabella dogs
commonly have tan points on their eyebrows, chin, feet, 
and tail.
 Dappled: Dappling, also called merling, is a pattern in which
random, ragged patches of a lighter color (not white) occur
over a darker color. Any color can have dappling on it, and the
dappled patches typically are lighter shades of the base color.
Dapples come in many colors. Black and tan-dappled Dachsies
are dappled with gray. Reds are dappled with lighter red.
Chocolates are dappled with cream. Isabella and tan-dappled
Dachsies are dappled with a lighter silver-gray. The double-
dappled dog has white patches in addition to the colored dap-
pling. In the extreme, these dogs are called piebald and have
very large patches of white (usually considered undesirable).
 Brindled: Brindling is a striped pattern. The stripes typically
are thin and somewhat ragged, not clear and sharp like 
a tiger’s.
Male or Female? The 
Battle of the Sexes
Another consideration when choosing your new Dachsie friend is
whether you want a boy or a girl. In some breeds, gender seems to
make a difference. You hear that the boys are sweeter and more
affectionate, or that the girls are gentler and better with kids — 
or that either gender is more standoffish, yippy, aggressive, or 
independent.
Some breeders describe Dachshunds as bitch-dominant (and they
don’t even giggle when they say it). That means the females some-
times are more independent or seem less needy than the males
(something common in many smaller breeds, I’ve found). But others
claim that any differences in personality are related to individual
dogs, not to gender.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
50

Generally in Dachshunds, both sexes are equally sweet, equally
stubborn, and equally devoted. Females cost more to spay than
males cost to neuter, but this is a one-time expense and probably
shouldn’t figure much into your decision. Also, a neutered boy isn’t
likely to spray or wander, and a spayed female isn’t likely to have a
weight problem, despite what you may have heard or read.
Your best bet is to find a healthy, well-bred litter and then see which
puppy you feel a connection with. Or, better yet, let the puppy pick
you, with the breeder’s guidance. (The breeder can also help you find
a puppy whose temperament best matches your lifestyle.) Boy or girl
really doesn’t matter. The match between you and the puppy is the
most important thing, and either sex may be best suited for you.
Although gender doesn’t affect personality significantly, it becomes
more of a factor when you bring home two Dachshunds. Unneutered
males and unspayed females may not get along well with the same
sex, but they may get along perfectly with a dog of the opposite sex.
Of course, that means you risk the chance of becoming a breeder
without meaning to. But you are going to neuter or spay your dog 
or dogs anyway, right? Don’t delay! (See Chapter 16 for more on 
the procedure.)

R
eady to go hunting? Whoa there, put away that orange 
vest! This kind of hunting is all about locating the very best
Dachshund breeder you can find. Because Dachshunds are popular,
they’re pretty easy to find — but a quality breeder is a different
story. Unfortunately, for-profit breeders often churn out dogs with
quantity in mind rather than quality, resulting in pets with health
and/or temperament issues.
The good news is, great Dachshund breeders also abound, if you
know where to look. A good Dachshund breeder is absolutely crazy
for his or her beloved breed and is working in whatever way possi-
ble to ensure that Dachshunds get better and better with each new
generation — in health, looks, and temperament. How do you know
the good breeder from the not-so-good breeder? Well, that’s what
this chapter is all about. (If you’re more interested in rescuing a
Dachshund from a shelter or rescue group, skip to Chapter 5.)

The point of this chapter is to help you remember that just seeing 
an adorable Mini Dachshund for sale doesn’t mean your search is
over. You have some more work to do, and this work is important.
It’s time to track down the right Dachshund for you — and that hunt
starts with the right breeder.
Finding the Right Breeder
So how do you find a breeder who loves Dachshunds and devotes
his or her life to making Dachshunds stronger, healthier, and more
beautiful? You do a little research, and you ask for help. Many local
and national Dachshund clubs will be happy to provide you with
referrals to breeders they’ve found acceptable. For instance, you
can contact the Dachshund Club of America (DCA), which is a great
resource for Dachshund information and of reputable member
breeders who have signed a strict code of ethics about breeding
practices. Check out its Web site at www.dachshund-dca.org
and click on Breeders/Puppies, or you can go straight to its list of
breeder referral coordinators by state at www.dachshund-dca.org/
breederreferral.html. Also, check out www.dachshund-dca.
org/clubs.html for a list of local branches of the national club. 
A branch in your area may be able to give you the most relevant
information.
Another great way to find a breeder is by visiting a dog show (see
Chapter 15). Dog shows bring many breeders to one place for your
browsing convenience. Ask around and see what names you hear
over and over. What kennel names have a great reputation? What
breeder seems to be great in your area? Dog shows are full of people
who probably have some pretty strong opinions about who the best
breeders are. Be friendly and ask questions (but wait until the breed-
ers or handlers are done showing and have a minute to relax). You
can also ask breeders at a dog show any Dachshund questions you
may have — from inquiring about the suggested price of a healthy
pet to the best diet for a Miniature. But beware: You may get bitten
by the bug and want to buy a champion and start showing!
In other words, you want to go where the Dachshund people go.
You’ll get the low-down.
You may think a “fancy” show breeder will charge a paw and a tail
for a good Dachshund, but think again! Pet stores typically charge
at least as much or more for their purebred dogs, and you won’t be
able to get much after-care advice, let alone see the parents or talk
to the breeder about breeding priorities. And when you buy a dog
from the newspaper or online, you may find a cheaper price, but
how much support are you going to get? What kind of guarantee
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
54

will you get? What happens if something is wrong with the dog?
Will the breeder you find really know what he or she is doing? A
hobby breeder who shows his or her dogs will definitely be your
best investment and the most likely source of a healthy, happy
Dachshund.
Visiting potential breeders
After you obtain some breeder names through your research, 
you can start talking to breeders and evaluating their breeding pro-
grams. Visit several kennels (even if you think you’ve found your
dream Dachsie at the very first place you visit). Ask questions (see
the following section for some possibilities). Look at the puppies,
the parents, and the surroundings. Watch how the puppies interact
with each other and how they behave toward you and the breeder.
You can learn a lot about a breeder just by paying attention.
The following list presents a few red flags to watch for when 
visiting a breeder:
 The puppies shy away from the breeder.
 The adult dogs other than the mother don’t seem approach-
able, or they act nervous.
 The surroundings are very dirty.
 The breeder avoids certain questions or refuses to let you 
see the parents of a litter.
 The breeder is eager to have you take home a Standard
Dachshund puppy younger than 8 weeks or a Miniature
Dachshund puppy younger than 12 weeks.
 The dogs look too thin or sickly, have bare spots in their
coats, or have bloated bellies.
If you notice any of the red flags in the previous list, keep looking 
for better breeders. You may feel sorry for those poor puppies, but
buying one just supports bad breeding, and you’ll likely be in for a
lot of expense and heartaches. The wait to find a really good breeder
is worth it.
Some breeders aren’t worth your time, no matter how cute the
puppies are. If a breeder tells you one thing on the phone (or at a
dog show or other meeting) but you find that the opposite is true
when you visit; if the terms of a sale change when the breeder
learns more about you (perhaps the dog suddenly becomes more
expensive when the breeder sees your sports car, or the dog you
want suddenly isn’t available but a smaller, sicklier-looking pup is
Chapter 4: May the Best Breeder Win 55

conveniently on sale); or if you get any kind of bad feeling about
the situation, trust your intuition and move on. No matter how
fetching and/or bargain-priced the puppies are, dealing with a 
disreputable or irresponsible breeder isn’t worth it.
Good breeders, on the other hand, aren’t out to make a profit. A
“high” price on a Dachshund from a good breeder only seems high
to someone on the outside. A good breeder probably just barely
covers expenses, and many don’t even do that. Plus, most breeders
find that setting higher prices helps to screen out impulse purchases
and people who aren’t really committed to pet ownership.
Putting a breeder checklist to use
You need to ask a potential breeder plenty of questions, and a good
breeder will ask you plenty of questions, too. But what do you ask
in order to figure out whether he or she is breeding responsibly and
producing healthy, happy, well-adjusted puppies? You don’t have to
be a pet detective. Just bring along this checklist to every kennel
and dog show you visit, and don’t be afraid to ask the breeders you
meet every question. You can learn a lot from their answers and
from what they don’t — or won’t — tell you. Here are some things
to ask:
 What do I need to know about Dachshunds in general and
about your Dachshunds in particular? You’ve probably done
plenty of research by this point (or will if you continue with this
book!), but you still want to know what the breeder has to tell
you about the breed. Listen for a couple of things:
• Does the breeder seem very knowledgeable about
Dachshunds, or does he or she tell you only very general
things you already know?
• Does the breeder only tell you the good side of the breed,
or does he or she let you know about the challenging
aspects of Dachshund ownership?
• Can the breeder give you a good idea about the 
specific dogs and lines of his or her kennel? What are the
strengths and weaknesses of his or her particular dogs?
 How long have you been breeding Dachshunds? Find out 
how the breeder got started. If the breeder has been in it for
decades, you’ve probably found somebody established and
very knowledgeable. A breeder new to the game may also have
great intentions and be producing great pups. But plenty of
people try breeding and give it up quickly, so a breeder who
has stood the test of time may be a better bet.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
56

 How often do you breed? A breeder in it for 20 years who has
bred only a handful of litters won’t have “20 years of experi-
ence.” On the other hand, a breeder in the business for only a
few years who has already bred 100 litters probably is going for
profit, not quality; chances are, the dogs he or she produces
aren’t kept in very good conditions. Your best bet: an experi-
enced hobby breeder who breeds one or two litters every year
or two.
 What’s your philosophy of dog breeding? Asking this question
gives you a little insight into what the breeder is all about. No
breeder will say, “Oh, well, you know, I’m just in it for the cold,
hard cash,” But responses that sound ill-informed, vague, or
don’t have anything to do with health and temperament — 
or no response to a question at all — should raise red flags.
Breeders who seem passionate about improving the health of
the breed and enhancing the Dachshund’s friendly and agree-
able temperament — who say things like, “All my dogs would
make great pets because, to me, pet quality means the highest
possible quality” — are probably sources for excellent pets.
 Have any of your dogs suffered from canine intervertebral
disk disease? What are the chances my dog will get it? Disk
disease is a serious issue for Dachshunds, and you need to get
the straight poop. (Also check out Chapter 17 for more on the
issue.) If a breeder answers that yes, he or she has had dogs
with disk disease, that’s no reason to run. In fact, that means
the breeder is being honest. Although some breeders are able
to keep their lines largely free of this disease, the condition is
so common in Dachshunds that most breeders who have been
in the business for a long period of time have experienced it.
Look for a breeder who’s straightforward about disk disease.
Honesty is much more important than waiting for a breeder to
tell you, “In 35 years, none of my Dachshunds have ever had
back problems.” Chances are, if you hear that, you aren’t 
getting the whole truth.
Breeders shouldn’t breed Dachshunds that experience 
canine intervertebral disk disease. Sounds like a clear-cut
rule. However, because disk problems typically don’t manifest
themselves until the average age of 4 years, and because no
test can determine which dogs will suffer from it, Dachshunds
are sometimes bred and then later develop back problems
through no fault of the breeder.
 May I call your veterinarian for a reference? A breeder who
won’t give you the number of his or her vet either doesn’t want
you to know something or doesn’t visit the vet very often. Both
are bad signs. Better to have a breeder who takes puppies and
Chapter 4: May the Best Breeder Win 57

dogs to the vet often than to have a breeder whose dogs are
“so healthy they don’t need a vet.” All dogs need periodic, 
regular vet visits, and good breeders make sure they get them.
When you get the vet’s contact information, call the vet and
ask about the health and temperament of that breeder’s dogs.
The vet has no personal stake in whether the breeder sells a
puppy, so assuming that the vet is a good one, you should get
an unbiased review.
 What kind of health guarantee do you offer? Good breeders
require that new owners take their puppies to the vet right
away — usually within three to seven days, and more often
within a day or two. If the veterinarian finds a serious health
problem, the breeder should be willing to refund your money
or replace the puppy. Of course, you may not want to give up
your puppy, and you may be willing to do whatever it takes to
get your puppy through whatever health crisis has arisen. But
the breeder should make amends if you so desire. Get an
agreement in writing.
 What vaccinations does the puppy have already, and what
will I need to do in terms of future health care? The breeder
should’ve given his or her puppies at least one set of standard
vaccinations and should give you a schedule of vaccinations
to be administered by your vet. Also, be sure to get the name
and number of the breeder’s vet so that your vet can call to
find out what has been given so far.
Puppies need vaccinations, but overvaccinating isn’t good 
for a puppy. If a 7- or 8-week-old puppy has already had three
rounds of vaccines, that’s too much; the breeder may be using
vaccines to try to cover up poor health.
 I plan to keep this puppy forever. If something comes up,
however, that makes it impossible for me to keep the puppy
in the future, will you take it back? Not all breeders will do
so, but many will because they care about their puppies find-
ing and remaining in good homes. That doesn’t mean you’ll
get a refund ten years later, and you shouldn’t expect it. But
most good breeders who truly love their Dachsies will want
them back rather than have them end up in shelters or 
rescue programs.
Of course, you do plan to keep your puppy forever, don’t you?
A commitment on your part is as necessary as a good health
guarantee. A breeder will be looking for signs that you’ll be a
responsible and committed puppy owner, not somebody 
looking for future opportunities to get rid of a canine 
inconvenience.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
58

 When can I take the puppy home? Most good breeders won’t
let you take a puppy home until it’s at least 8 weeks old; most
Miniature breeders prefer to wait until at least 12 weeks. Those
6-week-old puppies in the pet store are simply too young, espe-
cially for a small dog. Between the 9th and 12th weeks, puppies
learn to interact with their littermates; during this time, they
build a healthy foundation for future interaction with other
dogs. This development may even facilitate future socialization
efforts on your part.
In addition to the benefits of sticking by their littermates, 
puppies get important nutritional benefits from nursing longer.
Reserve your puppy, put down a deposit, and wait it out.
 What sizes are your dogs? Because Miniature Dachshunds are
popular, some less-reputable breeders try to pass off tweenies,
or small Standards, as Miniatures. Technically, a Miniature is 
a dog that weighs 11 pounds or less at 1 year of age. Because
you’re probably buying a puppy, you can’t know for certain that
your dog will grow up to be a true Miniature. However, experi-
enced breeders can usually tell whether a puppy is going to 
be a true Miniature. (For more on dog sizes, see Chapter 3.)
The best way to tell that your puppy will be a true Miniature
is to see both parents. Ask to have them weighed in front of
you. If both are true Minis, chances are good that your puppy
will be, too — especially if the puppy’s pedigree has many
champions. Champions in your puppy’s pedigree means the
line is probably breeding true, and your puppy will be more
likely to look like its parents.
 May I see some of your other dogs? A breeder should be
proud to show you his or her dogs. Look for good health and
friendly temperament. The dogs should be approachable and
easygoing. The breeder should be able to take any of the adult
dogs out on a lead, and you should be able to go up to a dog
and pet it without the dog displaying any growling, shying
away, or nipping. These are serious signs of temperament
problems in healthy adult dogs.
One important exception: A part of the breed standard says
that the Dachshund should be bold to the point of brashness.
This characteristic makes new mothers pretty protective, so if
the mother of the litter you like doesn’t seem to want you to
get within six feet of her precious babies, don’t be alarmed.
That’s just nature in action.
Chapter 4: May the Best Breeder Win 59

Don’t be too quick to ask about cost just yet. Just as you don’t want
to buy a puppy from someone breeding only for profit, a breeder
doesn’t want to sell to somebody just looking for the cheapest thing
on four legs. When you determine that you’re working with a good
breeder, you can start talking dollars and cents. Dachshund prices
can vary by geographical region, as well as by how closely a
Dachshund pup fits the breed standard (see Chapter 2). Expect 
to pay between $400 and $800 for a well-bred pet.
Wait a minute . . . the breeder isn’t through with you yet. Don’t think
that you’ll be doing all the interviewing! A good breeder should
screen you just as carefully as you screen him or her. Expect to be
asked where you plan to keep your dog, why you want a dog, and if
you can afford a dog. And get ready for a lecture on the responsibili-
ties of pet ownership. A buyer who has done research and is open to
instruction, and who truly seems to bond with a puppy, will look like
a good prospect to a breeder.
Getting the Real Scoop 
on Contracts
Any lawyer would cringe if you buy an $800 dog without a contract;
however, not all breeders use contracts. Breeders get a sense
about buyers, and vice versa, and if everyone feels good about the
purchase of a pet, both parties may feel a contract is an unneces-
sary formality. I admit that I’ve bought expensive things without a
contract — I even leased a house without one (don’t tell my lawyer).
And perhaps you don’t want to bother with the legal mumbo jumbo.
But a lot of people don’t make purchases or sell dogs without con-
tracts in place, and that’s sensible. However, contracts protect both
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
60
There’s no dog like a show dog
Think you’re buying a show Dachshund? Technically, if a breeder sells you a “show
dog,” he or she is guaranteeing that your dog won’t have any disqualifying faults
(see Chapters 2 and 15). But Dachshunds don’t have many disqualifying faults. 
In fact, they have just one: The front legs shouldn’t knuckle over. Now, a show dog
with potential to win a championship is something else. If you want a show dog with
winning potential, you need to do a little more research on what constitutes a win-
ning Dachshund. Talk to your breeder and consider apprenticing with someone
who’s experienced with dog shows before choosing your potential champion.

you and the breeder and can simplify matters if any issues come up
later — like a health issue, a bounced check, or any other dispute.
Sure, contracts can be broken, but if they’re legal and well-written,
you have recourse if you suffer a loss.
The contract should state, in very specific terms, what will happen 
if something goes wrong and what kinds of matters the buyer or
breeder must take responsibility for. For instance, the contract
could state that if your dog is injured while in your care, the breeder
isn’t responsible; however, if the dog gets sick with something like
parvovirus that she contracted under the care of the breeder, or 
if she has a serious genetic problem, the breeder is responsible.
The contract should also mention the following:
 If something goes wrong, the responsible party should have 
a specified amount of time to correct the problem. This setup
prevents either you or the breeder from rushing to sue the
moment something happens to someone’s dissatisfaction.
 What laws will apply. If you and the breeder live in different
states, the contract should specify which state has jurisdiction
should a conflict arise.
 What constitutes correction of the problem. Will you get 
your money back? Will you get a replacement puppy? Will the
choice be up to you? If you want to keep the dog and pay to
have a genetic problem corrected or an illness treated, will the
breeder help you with the costs?
In general, asking for a contract isn’t a sign that you don’t trust
someone, and no good breeder should be offended if you ask for
one. Most probably already have contracts they always use.
Picking the Best Puppy for You
When you pick a breeder, develop a relationship, and set the terms
of the purchase from your chosen breeder, all you have left to do is
pick a puppy. But how do you know which one to pick? Dachshund
puppies are all so cute (see Figure 4-1). Is one as good as the next?
Yes and no. All the puppies up for sale in a well-bred litter probably
will make great pets. In some cases, however, the temperament and
tendencies of a particular puppy will turn out to be best suited to
you. Who knows the litter best? The breeder, of course.
Chapter 4: May the Best Breeder Win 61

Figure 4-1: Which of these puppies is the pick of the litter?
The breeder can be an invaluable resource in helping you pick the
puppy that will best match you and your situation. Good breeders
get to know their puppies as they care for them, socialize them, and
teach them the ropes of life in a human world. The breeder should
know which puppies tend to be more boisterous, which are quieter,
which love to fetch, which seem fond of cats, and which seem to
adore kids. Let your breeder help you pick based on your needs,
situation, and desires.
Of course, you may focus on one particular puppy and just know
that she’s the one. Or perhaps the puppy will choose you! You can’t
argue with chemistry. If you bond with a particular pup, and she
seems healthy and well-bred and the breeder agrees that the match
would be a good one, go for it. You’ve found your friend for life.
Wondering how to spot a healthy Dachshund puppy? Look for 
the following characteristics:
 A healthy coat with no bald patches
 Bright, shiny eyes that don’t run
 Clean, white, sharp puppy teeth
 Clean ears that are free of parasites
 A clean rear end with no encrusted feces
 Free and easy movement with no limping
 A healthy display of energy and curiosity
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
62

Tempted by that shy or incredibly sleepy puppy — the one that’s
smaller than all the rest? You may be able to nurse the little one
back to boisterous health, but excessive fatigue, lack of energy,
extra-small size, or unusual shyness may be a sign that your puppy
isn’t thriving. You may be asking for heartbreak. Let the breeder
handle that puppy and choose a healthy one instead.
Forming a Good Bond with 
a Dachsie Breeder
Finding a good breeder is like finding gold in the creek bed (okay,
it’s probably easier than that). Not only do you benefit right now,
but you and your Dachshund benefit for the rest of your lives — 
if you play your cards right, invest in your breeder, and proceed
wisely. When you find a good Dachshund breeder, forge a partner-
ship. Good breeders should be happy to provide you with all the
information you need, and most are excited to continue the rela-
tionship. If a problem comes up, the breeder can guide you. If your
dog gets sick or develops a problem, the breeder can tell you what
course of action to take. And most breeders just love getting holiday
cards with photos so they can see how their little puppies have
grown up!
I’m not saying that you should harass your breeder with constant
questions. Breeders have lives — usually pretty busy ones. Because
responsible dog breeding isn’t a profit-making venture, most breed-
ers are in it purely for the love of Dachshunds, so they have to hold
regular jobs, too. They may have families, take their dogs to dog
shows on weekends, and have a tough time getting a full night’s
rest when they have litters of puppies in their homes. Your breeder
won’t have time to talk to you on the phone every day, nursing you
through your Dachshund’s puppyhood trials and tribulations. That’s
why doing your research (like reading this book!) and becoming fully
prepared for the responsibility of puppy ownership is so important.
But the breeder you choose does need to know about health prob-
lems that arise — especially genetic ones that could influence his
or her breeding program. The breeder can help you out, and you
can help out the breeder, too, by keeping in touch and sharing
information about your Dachshund’s health and behavior.
The following tips can help you maintain a good relationship with
your Dachshund’s breeder — ensuring that you, the breeder, and,
Chapter 4: May the Best Breeder Win 63

most importantly, your Dachshund receive the maximum benefit 
of your commitment:
 Don’t call the breeder early in the morning or late at night.
That’s just rude!
 When you call, be polite, not demanding. Express your
awareness that you’re taking up the breeder’s time instead 
of taking the attitude that the breeder is there to serve you.
 Don’t mistake the breeder for your vet. If the problem
involves pain, bleeding, broken bones, or drastic changes in
habits, appetite, activity level, or behavior, please call your
vet first — and fast.
 Don’t assume that the breeder is at fault for a medical 
problem. An accusatory tone puts a person on the defensive.
Simply explain what’s going on and get some feedback.
Make sure, before you buy, that you have in place a health
guarantee that makes arrangements for what will happen in
the event of a health problem. (See the section “Getting the
Real Scoop on Contracts”.)
 Recognize that your breeder loved your puppy first and
helped to bring it into the world. The breeder is more family
than business associate.
How Much Is That Dachsie 
in the Window?
I don’t generally recommend buying a Dachshund from a pet 
store for many reasons:
 You usually can’t see the puppy’s parents.
 You can’t visit the breeder’s breeding facility.
 You can’t ask the breeder questions.
 Most pet store employees don’t know much about individual
dog breeds.
 Pet store puppies often are taken away from their mothers 
and siblings earlier than most breeders and canine behaviorists 
recommend.
 The price to purchase from a pet store usually is significantly
higher.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
64

The problem with not being able to see the dog’s parents, the breed-
ing facility where it was born, or even the breeder is that you can’t
get a sense as to whether the adorable little Dachshund was social-
ized at all, raised in healthy conditions, or bred to minimize health
problems (like disk disease). That Dachsie in the window may turn
out to be a wonderful pet, but your odds for securing a pet with
good health and temperament are better if you buy from a breeder.
However, if you simply can’t resist that Dachshund puppy at the
pet store (you’re only human, after all), and you’re willing to pay
more money for a dog that comes with less background informa-
tion, take a few very important precautions. You won’t be able to
tell everything about a dog from looking — not even a vet can do
that. Health problems like disk disease may not become evident 
for several years. The following list presents some advice if you
insist on buying a pet store puppy:
 Try to get background information. Your pet store puppy
probably won’t have parents on the premises, but the store
should have a written record of the shots and wormings the
puppy has already had. Don’t expect to learn much about the
puppy’s temperament from the pet store, however. The puppy
probably hasn’t been in the store very long, and pet store
employees usually aren’t trained to determine things like 
temperament.
 Give the puppy a once-over. Is the coat clean and shiny? 
Are the puppy’s eyes, ears, nose, and rectum clean? Does the
puppy act happy and energetic? Red flags include small bald
spots; “hot spots” (red, itchy places); dry, scaly patches; runny
or crusty eyes or nose; dirty ears; a dirty rectum; and tired,
slow, low-energy behavior. The puppy could be napping, of
course, so come back later in the day to see if the puppy perks
up and shows interest in you.
 Get a guarantee in writing. Most pet stores will guarantee 
their puppies for a certain amount of time, but that time period
often is pretty short (a day or two or a week or two). Take the
puppy to your vet immediately after purchase with the (writ-
ten) understanding that, should the vet determine the puppy is
in ill-health, you can bring it back for a full refund. If you know
and accept exactly where the pet store’s responsibility begins
and ends in terms of a health guarantee, you won’t run into
misunderstandings later.
 Make a commitment. A pet store puppy, like any other puppy,
may suffer from health problems later on. The dog will need
plenty of socialization, attention, and training. Please make
the commitment to care for your Dachshund and give it the
training and love it deserves

a Dachshund
In This Chapter
 Weighing the benefits of Dachsie adoption

I
n Chapter 4, I talk about purchasing your new dog from a breeder.
As I state there, good breeders are great. But as you probably
already know, buying a Dachshund puppy from a breeder isn’t your
only option. Many Dachshunds are waiting patiently for new homes
in breed rescue programs, in animal shelters, and with families 
who can’t keep them any longer. Many of these dogs are wonderful,
devoted, well-trained family members who got the short end of the
bone for one reason or another and no longer have a place to go.
Common reasons why Dachshunds sometimes lose their homes are
divorce, a death in the family, a move to a place that doesn’t allow
dogs, or an owner who simply can’t handle the responsibility. This
chapter points you in their direction.
On the other hand, some dogs are in rescue programs or shelters
because their owners made mistakes in training and/or socializa-
tion, bought badly bred dogs, or just ignored their dogs until they
became too much trouble. Sad as these scenarios may be, some 
of these dogs may not be reformable, and attempting to train and
socialize any dog that grew up learning bad habits can be tough.
Are you up to the task? This chapter helps you find out.

Making a Friend for Life
Adopting a Dachshund can be one of the most rewarding things you
can ever do as a pet owner. People who’ve adopted often claim that
their dogs seem eternally and exuberantly grateful throughout their
entire lives. Will the dog know what you’ve done for him? Maybe not
in so many words, but a dog who has lost his home and then finds
one with you will probably be as devoted a dog as you’ll find.
Of course, not every rescued or shelter dog comes pretrained, 
presocialized, and ready to accept a new home and owner without
question. Some dogs were abused and/or neglected. Some weren’t
well-trained or socialized in the first place. Some may be sick or
have health problems of some kind. Some were badly bred. Some,
unfortunately, won’t ever make good pets because they have too
many strikes against them.
But many rescued Dachshunds turn out to be wonderful, loving
pets. Some don’t have any behavior issues at all, and others may
need only a little extra TLC to regain that delightful Dachshund
demeanor. If you feel like you need or want to provide a home for a
Dachshund in need, that’s wonderful. And even if you aren’t sure, it
doesn’t hurt to look. Chances are, the Dachshund you’ll find in the
animal shelter or with a rescue group will make a great pet. Even if
you “know” you want a Dachshund puppy from a great breeder, you
may consider visiting an animal shelter and/or calling your local
Dachshund rescue organization just to see what’s out there. (You
can find rescue information on the Dachshund Club of America Web
site at www.dachshund-dca.org/rescue.html.)
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
68
A rescue program’s reason for being
According to the DCA’s rescue program, Dachshund rescue is active around the
country and was established
“. . . to aid Dachshund owners in the recovery of their animals when lost, strayed
or stolen; to keep Dachshunds out of the hands of laboratories, animal dealers,
puppy mills and similar enterprises, and to attempt to keep Dachshunds out of
pounds and animal shelters. Sadly, Rescue is most used to place the hundreds
of Dachshunds that have been abandoned each year and find homes that will
provide the love and care these dogs deserve.”
Help out a rescue program if you can; and if you can’t, please don’t make the problem
worse by abandoning a dog you’ve promised to keep.

Most rescued or shelter Dachshunds are a little older, and there 
are distinct advantages to adopting an older dog. Older dogs may
already be housetrained, they may be used to kids and other pets,
and they may even know a trick or two. Many of these dogs are
friendly, sweet, and well-behaved, and they need only a loving home
to make their lives — and your life — complete. Maybe you can 
provide one!
The Pros and Cons of 
Adopting a Dachsie
Before you run out and sign the papers to adopt a rescued or shelter
Dachshund, put some serious thought into it. Sure, it’s a wonderful
thing to do. However, you don’t want to get into a situation where
you’ll regret the adoption or, even worse, have to give the dog back.
You should consider the pros and cons of adopting a Dachshund,
weighing them against your situation and inclinations before making
a commitment. The very last thing a rescued or shelter Dachshund
needs is to think he has a new home and then end up back in rescue
or in the shelter again. Adopting a dog means being very committed
to keeping that dog until the end of his life. Someone has already
broken that commitment at least once, which is why the Dachshund
is waiting for a home.
Table 5-1 lists some pros and cons involved in adopting a rescued
or shelter Dachshund. Look over the list again and again. Listen to
your heart and to your head. You may feel awfully sorry for that
Dachshund, but if what you really, really want is a puppy from a
breeder, everyone will be better off if you follow your heart.

unless you and the rescue group do a thorough job

You may be thinking that Table 5-1 leaves a lot up in the air. How
can you tell which way a dog will be? Housetrained or not? Well-
socialized or not? Kid lover or not? Healthy or not? Will your
Dachsie be a lifelong family companion like the one in Figure 5-1?
Fortunately, rescue organizations and many animal shelters care-
fully screen the Dachshunds they’re attempting to place, so they
usually can tell you what they’ve observed about the Dachshunds’
behavior, temperament, and health status. Take advantage of the
people who know and ask a lot of questions. Do what you can to
show them that they’ll be placing the dog with someone who won’t
bring him right back in a couple of days.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund

Rescue worker phone etiquette
If you contact a Dachshund rescue organization, please be considerate. These
people usually work out of their homes, so find out what time zone an organization
is in and don’t call early in the morning or late at night. Many rescue people will
have an answering service that allows you to leave your number, but be advised
that they’ll call you back collect. Don’t be offended. Remember, these people aren’t
getting paid, and if they had to pay for every returned phone call, their phone bills
would get pretty hefty. Give them a break and accept all collect calls while you’re
trying to acquire a new family member.

Figure 5-1: Will your adopted Dachsie be a kid lover like this one?
Adopting through a Rescue
Organization
Your best bet to find an available Dachshund for adoption is to
contact a local or regional Dachshund rescue organization (see the
upcoming sidebar for some tips). These organizations are manned
by people who work long hours, usually for no pay, purely for the
love of Dachshunds — to find a good home for every Dachshund
they believe would make a good pet. The job is stressful and often
frustrating. It can also be supremely rewarding, however, when a
wayward dog finally finds the perfect place to live.
Rescue groups aren’t like animal shelters, which have dedicated
facilities and a paid staff (see the following section). Most rescue
groups consist of one or just a handful of dedicated volunteers
who take in abandoned dogs and try to find them homes — often
with the help of volunteer foster “parents.”
Chapter 5: Rescue Me! Adopting a Dachshund 71

Adopting through a rescue group is similar to adopting through a
shelter. Every group is a little different, but in most cases, you’ll
have to fill out a detailed application and answer a lot of personal
questions. The rescue workers want to be sure they’re sending off
their dogs to committed and quality homes. In many cases, the
rescue workers will require a home visit to see where you’ll keep
the Dachshund and what your home environment is like. Full of
wild little kids? No fence? Other large, aggressive dogs? Or is it a
Dachshund heaven?
Adoption usually isn’t a quick process but it should be a thorough
one. If a rescue group wants to give you a dog without any ques-
tions, you should ask some questions of your own to make sure you
and this dog are a good fit and the group has screened the dog for
health and behavior problems. Costs vary widely but usually are
designed to simply cover the costs the rescue group has incurred 
to take in, house, heal, and train the dog.
When you hook up with a Dachshund rescue organization, you’re
likely to find a fantastic network of Dachshund lovers eager to help
you help the displaced Dachshunds of the world. And the cause can
be compelling. You may find yourself deciding to be a Dachshund
foster home or otherwise involved in Dachshund rescue. There are
worse ways to spend your free time!
You can find rescue coordinators by state through the Dachshund
Club of America’s Web site. Check out www.dachshund-ca.org/
Rescue.html or head to www.petfinder.com, a clearinghouse of
shelter and rescue groups that allows you to search by your location
and the breed/age/gender you prefer.
Some rescued Dachshunds have been abused or neglected and may
need some patient, kind, and positive retraining and behavior modi-
fication (see the chapters of Part III for advice). If you’re determined
not to give up on your rescued Dachshund (and I hope you are), be
prepared to exercise supreme patience and exhibit plenty of affec-
tion. Also, consider hiring a canine behavioral consultant, an animal
behaviorist, and/or a private trainer. A professional has experience
with dogs that have been mistreated and can provide you with a
variety of personalized approaches to solving your dog’s particular
problems. Worth every penny, I say!
Working with Animal Shelters
Even if you don’t have a Dachshund rescue program in or near your
town (see the previous section), you probably have an animal shel-
ter. The main difference between adopting from a rescue group and
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
72

from an animal shelter is that the rescue group often specializes in a
particular breed. They may be better at screening for problems, and
they may have more time to give. Many animal shelters, however, do
an amazing job at screening potential pets, and many even have obe-
dience training programs to help make the animals more adoptable.
It all depends on where you live and what’s available to you, but
check out both options: rescue groups and animal shelters.
Sometimes, animal shelters shuttle any purebreds off to rescue
groups. In other cases, they may have purebred dogs, including
Dachshunds, right there in the shelters. Your local shelter may
take your name and contact you if a Dachshund comes in. But
don’t be surprised or offended if it doesn’t; shelter workers, like
rescue workers, often are overworked and underpaid. Your best
bet is to visit the shelter often and keep looking. (If nothing else,
frequent shelter visits will probably convince you to have your
future Dachshund spayed or neutered.)
Some animal shelters are the spectacular culminations of the
efforts of many people who are seriously committed to helping
place the animals they receive and to educating the public. Others
are barely scraping by on tiny budgets and have a hard time han-
dling the load of animals they receive.
Whatever the case in your area, be aware that adopting a shelter
dog often involves a lot of paperwork. You probably can’t just 
walk into the shelter and get one. Many shelters check out living 
situations by calling landlords to ensure that they allow dogs, for
example. It may seem like a pain, but just remember that all the
questions, forms, and red tape are for the protection of the pets. 
The shelter wants to feel confident that you won’t bring the dog
right back in a few weeks or months.
Chapter 5: Rescue Me! Adopting a Dachshund 73
Stick to the books: No 
dogs for college kids
If you’re a college student, you may be frustrated to find out that your local animal shel-
ter won’t let you adopt a dog under any circumstances. Is that fair? I mean, you just
know you’d be a fantastic dog owner. Actually, although many college students would
make great and committed dog owners, students are notorious for abandoning their
animals when they graduate. So many shelters have been burdened by huge influxes
of pets come graduation time that this policy is in place to safeguard the well-being of
the pets. Don’t be offended. Be glad the shelter is working in the overall best interest of
its animals. You can always adopt a pet after you’re settled into your post-school life.

Also, a shelter may not have the time to screen individual dogs for
temperament and health. Buyer beware, in other words. You may
get a great dog, or you may get a short-legged, long-bodied bundle
of trouble. Best to do your research, trust your intuition, and be
prepared for a lot of work, rehabilitation, and retraining (see the
chapters of Part III). Then, if you get a great pet, you’ll be happily
surprised.
Adopting a shelter dog is a wonderful — even noble — thing to do.
So many dogs desperately need good homes, and most of them won’t
ever find one. And the dog isn’t the only one who benefits. Many
people with shelter dogs are devoted to the point of fanaticism to
their rescued pets.
Adopting a shelter dog is a serious commitment, so please don’t
take it lightly. Just because a dog doesn’t cost $500 or $1,000 or
more doesn’t mean it isn’t as deserving of love, good medical care,
and your time. Be ready for a nervous, scared, confused pet that
needs a lot of patience, attention, and consistent and positive train-
ing. Work with your new friend, and you may just discover that you
have a diamond in the rough.
Part I: Preparing to Live with a Dachshund 
74
A Dachshund for life
Wherever you get your Dachshund, after you get it, it should be yours for life.
Dachshunds live a long time — often 12 to 16 years — and you should plan to keep
your new friend through thick and thin, for better or for worse, unless it’s absolutely
impossible to do so. Dachshunds (and all dogs, for that matter) are living, breathing,
sentient beings that form a relationship with their owners, depend on a regular rou-
tine, and look to humans for guidance, care, and affection. They feel pain, loss, and
neglect if they’re hurt, abandoned, or abused. If you take on the responsibility of a
dog, take it on for life. And if you absolutely must give up your dog because of cir-
cumstances beyond your control, at least see that it finds a new home where it can
receive the proper amount of care and love — and won’t be given up again.

n Part II, you ﬁnd out how to prepare your home, your-
self, and your family for a fun-ﬁlled life with a Dachshund.
I tell you how to Dachshund-proof your home and family
(including the kids), what things to buy, and what to expect
when you bring home your energetic friend for the ﬁrst
time.

f you have small children or small siblings, you probably know
all about childproofing the house. You cover electrical outlets,
put childproof latches on the bottom cabinets, stow all the clean-
ers and household chemicals out of reach, and put those covers
over the doorknobs so the little ones don’t open the door and go
wandering away.
But how much consideration have you given to puppy-proofing? 
A new puppy can get into a lot of trouble if the house isn’t puppy-
proofed, and Dachshunds in particular — who joyfully gnaw
through or swallow just about anything they can get their teeth
around and who are too short to jump safely from great heights —
are particularly in need of a safe, secure, Dachs-proofed 
household.
How do you Dachs-proof your home? First, you read this chapter.
Then you get busy and make a few changes before you let that
puppy loose in the house. It only takes a moment for a puppy to
get in trouble when you aren’t watching, so just as with a baby,
better safe than sorry. The extra effort you spend to prepare 
your home for your newest Dachsie resident is well worth it for
everyone.

Considering a Dachs-Eye 
View of Home
The world looks a lot different to a Dachshund than it does to you.
Can you imagine walking around with your eye level less than a
foot above the ground? No? Try it. In fact, the best thing to do
before you change one single thing about your household in prepa-
ration for your new puppy is to get down on your belly and look
around each room in your house. (You may want to vacuum first.
You’ll be sliding around on the floor!)
Find a piece of paper and a pen or pencil; then get on down there.
That’s it, get right down to the floor. All the way down. You’re still
too tall if you’re on your hands and knees. All the way down on
your belly.
Now take a good look around: This is a Dachs-eye view of the world.
Try to think like a Dachshund puppy. Get excited, a little nervous,
and very, very curious. From your Dachshund vantage point, what
do you see that looks like fun? Ooh, a dangling miniblind cord!
Could be perfect for a game of tug of war. Look at that bottle cap
under the couch! Feeling the urge to ferret it out and give it a good
crunch? What about that nice display of China figurines, almost
within reach? Maybe if you jumped. . . .
Make a note of everything you see that could possibly cause trou-
ble for a small dog. Stay down there until you’re sure that you’ve
exhausted the possibilities. Read on for some things to look for
while you’re surveying. Then, after you’re done, you may just feel
the urge to curl up and take a nap. See any comfy pillows? A
Dachshund-friendly house should have at least a few.
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home

The danger of choke chains
I don’t generally recommend choke collars (one end slips through a loop on the
other end so the collar tightens when pulled) because I don’t think they’re neces-
sary when positive training methods are employed. Miniature Dachshunds in par-
ticular can be injured by a choke collar, but these collars can be dangerous for any
Dachshund because of their small size and delicate spines. Plus, a choke collar
could get caught on something with disastrous results. I wouldn’t risk it! A better
option is the Gentle Leader, or Halti Collar. These effective training devices give you
more control over the dog without having to jerk your little one around.

Preparing for Demolition Dog
So you think your sweet little dog couldn’t make too much of a
mess? You’d be surprised. Do you really love your collection of
antique teacups or crystal vases? Then either display them well
above the level any Dachshund can reach or put them away for a
while. Puppies are exuberant and curious, and they haven’t yet
learned what areas are off limits to them (see Figure 6-1). It’s not
the puppy’s fault if he jumps onto that end table to see just what’s
up there and breaks something valuable. Imagine that you have a
toddler in the house and pack away the fragile stuff accordingly.
Figure 6-1: Dachshunds love to get into things, and that includes making a bed
out of your favorite blanket.
Also, although a Dachshund is small, he has a pretty big mouth,
and I don’t just mean he barks a lot. He can also chew to the point
of major destruction. Really. No two ways about it, Dachshunds
love to chew. In fact, they not only love it, but they also consider it
their dog-given right. Your Dachshund will consider anything that
looks chewable to be his own personal property. So you thought
that slipper was yours? Think again. As far as your new puppy is
concerned, if he sees it and decides he wants to chew it, it’s his.
The world is his chew toy
The best way to combat the loss of some of your more valuable
pairs of shoes, not to mention your furniture, is to have a good

supply of acceptable chew toys on hand. Stow them everywhere so
one is always within reach. Look for sturdy chew toys without
small parts that could break off. If you’re consistent about enforc-
ing the house rules, your new puppy will soon learn what is okay
to chew and what isn’t. Then, eventually, he’ll develop enough self-
control to stop himself from chewing that juicy-looking, brand-new
sneaker.
Avoid giving your Dachshund cat toys, even if you have a Mini.
Dachshunds are more enthusiastic chewers than cats and they
have larger mouths and stronger jaws. Cat toys often have small
pieces like bells, feathers, or felt that a Dachshund can easily swal-
low or choke on.
The best way to discourage this sort of destruction in the early
stages is to offer a firm “No” when your Dachshund is in the process
of chewing or clawing; then immediately redirect him to an accept-
able but similar activity. For example, if your Dachsie is chewing
your shoe, say “No!” and then take away the shoe, replacing it with
a chew toy in his mouth. If he chews the chew toy, heap on the
praise.
If you have a piece of furniture or other object that your
Dachshund just won’t leave alone, buy a bottle of chew-deterrent
spray, like Bitter Apple brand spray, and follow the directions. This
spray makes the object taste horrible, and your Dachshund will
probably learn quickly to leave it alone. If this doesn’t work, you
may also try wrapping the area in aluminum foil or keeping a spray
bottle filled with water on hand to deter the behavior. Or you can
keep a can filled with pennies nearby to startle your Dachshund
away from the forbidden area.
If you have a digger, you may want to consider purchasing a few
carpet squares or remnants that are reserved for your Dachshund.
He can dig and scratch on them to his heart’s content. If he
scratches and digs on your carpet or wall, move him immediately
to his carpet — even help move his paws in a digging motion over
it. If he gets it, praise him for all you’re worth. He’ll get the idea . . .
eventually.
Choking hazards
Take a good look around your home for small objects on the floor
or within reach that would fit in your Dachshund’s mouth. Things
like bottle caps, rubber bands, string or thread, loose screws, twist
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
80

ties, small blocks or balls (such as cat toys), and even small wads
of paper trash. All these things can be hazardous to your puppy.
Small, hard objects can lodge in a dog’s throat and block the air
passages. String-like objects can actually cause internal damage.
If your puppy does choke on something, let him try to dislodge it
himself. If your dog isn’t breathing, whether unconscious or not,
try to hook the object out with your finger, if he’ll let you. Just
don’t force the object in farther. If that procedure doesn’t work,
you can try a movement similar to the Heimlich maneuver:
1. Place your Dachshund up on all fours and then lift his
front end slightly off the ground.
2. Put your fist (on a Standard) or thumb (on a Mini) on his
upper abdomen just below his rib cage and then thrust
upward.
Don’t be too rough. You don’t want to injure him. And 
keep doing this procedure a few times to try to get the
object out.
3. Do one of the following:
• If you can dislodge the object, take him straight to 
the vet after your dog can breathe. He may have inter-
nal injuries.
• If you can’t dislodge the object, rush your pet to the
nearest vet or emergency pet care facility. If you can,
take someone with you who can keep trying the 
modified Heimlich maneuver to dislodge the object
en route.
If all this choking talk sounds scary to you, you’re right to feel
alarmed. The best thing to do is keep all choking hazards out of
reach, especially if your puppy tends to try to chew on everything
in sight. Some puppies are more inclined to chew than others, but
chewing is definitely a Dachshund trait.
When you’re looking for potential choking hazards, don’t forget to
look for strangling hazards, too. More cats than dogs are probably
strangled in blind cords, but it can happen. Keep blind cords out 
of reach — especially if you have children. Keep all the little ones
safe: human, canine, and feline. Small dogs can also get caught up
in drapery sashes or miniblinds. Also remove any hook-like objects
that are within reach but off the floor because they may possibly
catch on your puppy’s collar or leash.
Chapter 6: Making Your Home Dachshund-Proof 81

Poisons
Want another thing to worry about with a chew-happy puppy?
Poisons. Even if you keep the drain cleaner and the bleach out of
reach, plenty of other household items and substances can poison
your puppy, from ibuprofen (like Advil) or aspirin tablets to rotten
food in your trashcan. Here are some common household poisons
that you should keep well out of reach from your puppy:
 Cleaners of all types. Some are more toxic than others, but
who wants to wait and see which ones may be okay?
 All human and pet medication. Even if you’re not sure that a
specific medicine is toxic to pets, keep them all out of reach.
Some medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil), are highly toxic
to pets.
 Pesticides of any type. Even your pet’s flea control product
can be toxic if gobbled up. Don’t let your puppy play with or
chew any insect traps or bait, like rat, mouse, or roach traps.
 Certain foods. Dogs can be poisoned by chocolate, onions,
grapes or raisins, and even sugarless gum. Even small
amounts can be fatal.
 Some houseplants. They’re poisonous to varying degrees.
Keep your plants above Dachshund level.
 Some miscellaneous items. Many seemingly innocuous items
can be extremely toxic to a dog, such as potpourri oil, coffee
grounds, fabric softener sheets, dishwashing detergent, bat-
teries, cigarettes, and alcohol.
While doing poison control, don’t forget the yard. Keep your 
puppy off the lawn if you’ve recently sprayed it with insecticides or
fertilizer. Keep all lawn and garden chemicals out of reach (not to
mention sharp objects). Keep your puppy out of the garage, too.
Gasoline, oil, and antifreeze can kill your puppy. Also, the following
common outdoor plants are poisonous to dogs:
 Azalea
 Oleander
 Castor bean
 Sago palm
 Yew plant
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
82

One tablespoon of antifreeze can kill a 20-pound dog, so imagine
how little it would take to harm your Mini Dachshund. Antifreeze
smells and tastes yummy to dogs. So Dachs-proof your garage and
driveway in the winter by keeping antifreeze out of reach. Even
leaking or spilled puddles on the driveway can mean death to your
dog. (Note that you can now buy antifreeze that’s advertised as
safer for pets, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still do every-
thing you can to keep your pet away from it.)
If you know or suspect that your dog has been poisoned, call the
National Animal Poison Control Center (NAPCC), a 24-hour emer-
gency veterinary poison hotline. A $55 consultation fee may be
applied to your credit card. Call 1-888-426-4435. Post this phone
number on your refrigerator with your other emergency numbers.
When you need the number, you’ll need it fast. You can get more
information at the NAPCC Web site, at www.napcc.aspca.org.
Compensating for Stairs
A big thing to consider when Dachs-proofing your home is how to
make your stairs Dachshund-friendly. Stairs are hard on Dachshund
backs (see Chapter 17), especially for the Minis because each step
is a lot bigger to a 7-pound dog than to a 30-pound dog. If you have
stairs in your home, that’s no reason to give up your Dachshund
dreams. But you do need to take a few precautions.
If you have the space and the resources, a ramp is great for
Dachshunds. A ramp is most practical outside, where you can offer
your dog an alternate route off the deck. The problem is that some
Dachshunds ignore that carefully constructed ramp and take the
stairs anyway. (Some gladly use the ramp, though. You just never
know.)
You can install a gate so the ramp is the only way down for your
pet, but now you’re getting pretty fancy. Some gates, made for
small children or pets, bolt onto walls or decks and have an easy-
open swinging mechanism for the convenience of adults. This
option is worth it if you can afford it, but it’s not for everyone.
Inside is a different story. Most people don’t have the space to
build a ramp over half their staircase. The best solution is to install
those pet gates (or baby gates) at the top and bottom of all stair-
cases. The newer ones bolt to the wall and swing open so you
Chapter 6: Making Your Home Dachshund-Proof 83

don’t have to take the whole gate off to go up and down. Most can
be operated easily with one hand. Then, when your Dachsie has 
to go upstairs, you can pick him up and carry him. And when he’s
ready to go back down? Pick him up and carry him again.
Some people aren’t willing to do this task, of course, and others
argue that Dachshunds are built to be natural athletes and should
be able to climb stairs. I won’t argue. Some Dachsies race up and
down the stairs all day long, every day, and never suffer from a
back problem. Others may develop back problems, and you won’t
know whether or not it had anything to do with daily jaunts up and
down your staircase.
Deciding whether or not your Dachsie is allowed to climb the
stairs comes down to risk assessment. Going up and down stairs
can be hard on those Dachshunds who’ll probably have back prob-
lems anyway, and climbing the steps may trigger an incident. Other
dogs, though, will be fine. You can play it safe but expend more
effort, or you can expend a lot of effort to prevent something that
may never happen. As long as you recognize that you’re taking
responsibility for your pet, you can make the decision.
Ledges and Couches 
and Beds, Oh My!
Some Dachshunds are impossible to keep off beds and couches,
and when they decide to get down, they get down before you can
stop them. Some people build little Dachshund ramps from their
beds and couches so their Dachshunds can scamper easily down
from high places. Others recognize that their pets are going to
jump, and these folks just hope for the best. It’s up to you to gauge
your individual situation and determine what works for you and
your pet, but it is possible to train a Dachshund to use a ramp.

eeping your home free of poisons and choking hazards is great
(see Chapter 6), but it won’t do much good if your toddler 
barrels across the room and sits squarely on your new puppy. Even
an adult can unwittingly injure a Dachshund if he or she doesn’t
know how to hold one correctly. And that poor, scared little puppy
will soon be at the mercy of your family.
Are they loud? Are they boisterous? Is your family life a little
chaotic? All families are. But that doesn’t mean you can’t create a
Dachshund oasis for your new puppy, especially when you first
bring her home. Read on.
Giving Your Family 
Dachshund Lessons
After you secure your home environment (for details, see Chapter
6), it’s time to Dachs-proof the occupants. Not everyone in your
family automatically knows how to handle a Dachshund puppy, so
a family meeting is in order. The topic of discussion? Life with a
new Dachshund.
Make sure that everyone gets in on this meeting. Children espe-
cially need to know a few things about Dachshunds before you turn
them loose on the poor, unsuspecting puppy. At the meeting, you
can enumerate the nine no-no’s of Dachshund ownership. The kids
get an extra couple of tips, too.

Because of their unusually long bodies, Dachshunds must be picked
up and held with good support on both ends at all times. Show your
children (and adults, too) how to pick up a Dachshund before they
try it on their own. Put one hand under the Dachshund’s chest. Put
the other hand under the Dachshund’s rump. Lift slowly without
twisting your dog and keep both ends fully supported. See Figure
7-1 for an example. Never lift a Dachshund by the front end only,
allowing her back legs to swing around. This can injure her back.
The nine no-no’s of Dachshund 
ownership
I won’t go so far as to say that you need to require every member
of your family to memorize and recite back to you the following list
of Dachshund no-no’s, but it won’t hurt to post this list somewhere
and make sure that everyone has read it at least once:
 Don’t overwhelm your Dachshund. Dachshunds are rela-
tively small dogs and can be easily scared or confused by lots
of people, loud noises, and chaos. Give your Dachshund a
place to go away from the family uproar. A kennel or crate is a
perfect Dachshund haven.
 Don’t overfeed your Dachshund. Dachshunds are prone to
getting chubby, which wreaks havoc on their spines. Cool it
on the treats and people food. Use pieces of kibble out of your
Dachshund’s daily food ration for treats and training, or vary
her diet a bit with healthy people food like small pieces of raw
carrots, broccoli, apples, and berries. Puppies love chasing a
wayward, rolling blueberry around the kitchen!
However, never give grapes, raisins, onions, or chocolate —
these can be toxic to dogs (more on these and other hazards
in Chapter 6).
 Don’t skimp on quality food. Buy the best food you can find.
Ask your vet for recommendations. Dog food quality is often
directly related to dog food price, although you may occasion-
ally hear otherwise. The more natural and the more meat, the
better. I don’t believe it hurts to add some healthy, fresh,
whole human food to your pet’s diet, either — up to about 
30 percent of the meal and primarily meat — as long as you
adjust kibble portion size accordingly. (See Chapter 8 for
more on what to feed your Dachshund.)
 Don’t be a couch potato. Dachshunds need exercise (just like
you do), so don’t neglect that daily walk. Some playtime in the
fenced backyard is great for your Dachshund’s health, too,
and helps keep obesity at bay.
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
86

 Don’t ignore your Dachshund. Dachsies thrive on human
attention and affection, plus they look to you for guidance on
good behavior. If you decide to bring a Dachshund into your
life, decide to spend time training and simply being with your
dog each day.
 Don’t let your Dachshund escape. Dachshunds are proficient
diggers and can be pretty clever escape artists. They also
can’t be trusted off leash near traffic, no matter how well
trained you think they are. They are hounds and will follow a
scent, oblivious to danger. You’re in charge and must keep
your Dachshund safely enclosed or on a leash. Otherwise, 
you could lose your friend.
 Don’t assume that your Dachshund can speak English or
read your mind. Your friend needs teaching so she can learn
the house rules and proper behavior. That’s your job as the
human end of the Dachshund-human relationship. Figure out
how to train your Dachshund and work on it every day. Puppy
obedience classes are a great place to start. For more on train-
ing a Dachsie, check out Chapters 13 and 14.
 Don’t skip the vet visits. All dogs need routine veterinary
evaluations in addition to their vaccinations in the first year.
As your Dachsie ages, these checkups become even more
important. Keep your pet as healthy as possible by fully 
utilizing your vet’s expertise to catch problems before they
turn serious.
 Don’t ignore a yelp of pain or any sudden signs that your
Dachshund is losing the use of her legs. When an acute disc
herniation occurs, time is of the essence. Waiting it out to see
whether it goes away can mean paralysis for your dog. If you
can’t get her to a vet immediately, put her in her crate and don’t
let her move. (Movement can injure the spinal cord and cause
permanent paralysis when the herniation could otherwise have
been repaired.) Then get her to the vet or emergency-care
facility ASAP. (For more on canine intervertebral disk disease
and what to do if your Dachshund suffers from disc herniation,
see Chapter 17.)
Your vet may have additional helpful tips for family members
about life with a new Dachshund. Choosing a vet with Dachshund
expertise is best. He will know from experience what to look for.
Dachs-proofing your kids
Kids love Dachshunds, and the feeling is mutual, but kids can
sometimes get a little boisterous and rough with a small dog. If all
Chapter 7: Dachs-Proofing Your Family 87

children learned and demonstrated respect for their fellow crea-
tures on this Earth, the world would be a kinder, gentler place. Do
your part by Dachs-proofing your kids. What could result but
family harmony?
Copy this list and give it to your kids. Read it or explain it to the
younger ones. These are rules for your kids to live by:
 Dogs love to play, but sometimes they need to be alone.
Everyone has their limits. After an exuberant playtime, give
your dog some downtime in her den.
If a dog walks away from an approaching child, she’s commu-
nicating that she doesn’t want to be bothered. If the toddler
keeps approaching and no parent intervenes, a bite is proba-
bly imminent. Listen to your Dachshund’s body language!
 Dogs need to have privacy when they eat and sleep. No
poking, prodding, or pulling a dog during dinner. Instinct may
cause her to respond with a snap. Also, no rude awakenings,
please. Dogs need to sleep a lot, and when they’re sleeping,
it’s hands off.
 No junk food. Dogs need healthy food and may get sick if
given candy, sweets, chips, or other unhealthy food. If your
parents generally don’t like you to eat something, or if they
call it a special treat, don’t give it to the dog. No, not even
when Mom and Dad aren’t looking. You wouldn’t want your
dog to get really sick just because of what you fed her.
 Dachshunds — especially Minis and Dachshund puppies —
aren’t as tough as most kids. They must be handled gently,
not roughly. No tug of war for Dachshunds, either. The sharp
back-and-forth movements can hurt their backs. Also,
Dachshunds are small and short. Never drop them from your
arms or from anything else. Hold a Dachshund only while sit-
ting on the floor, and always support the Dachshund’s back
end when carrying her anywhere, even a short distance.
 Never, ever pet any dog you don’t know very well. If you 
see a dog wandering around alone, leave her alone and tell a
grownup. If you see someone walking a dog and think you’d
like to pet her, always ask the owner first; then pet the dog
slowly and talk softly. That’s the way to make friends with 
a dog.
Kids can be a dog’s best friend or a dog’s worst enemy. Some 
kids are great with dogs and quickly become a puppy’s primary
trainer. Others, especially those under the age of 7 or 8, find it 
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
88

very difficult to handle a dog carefully and gently. Because
Miniature Dachshunds are particularly small and can easily be
injured as puppies, most vets and breeders don’t recommend
bringing a Mini into a household with children who aren’t yet in
the first or second grade.
Kid-proofing your Dachsie
Of course, when you mix up kids and dogs, the kids aren’t the only
ones with potential to do some damage. An irritated or injured
Dachshund can snap at a small child (or even a large child), and a
bite can break the skin.
When bringing a Dachshund into a home with children, introduce
her to the kids one at a time. Have the kids approach slowly, pet
gently, and talk softly. Eventually, your Dachshund will know 
everyone and feel comfortable. And remember to show your kids
the proper way to hold a Dachshund. It’s shown in Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1: Hold the Dachshund close to your body 
and support her legs and underbelly.
Chapter 7: Dachs-Proofing Your Family 89

Bringing a new baby into a home where a Dachshund is already
firmly entrenched? Try this: A few days before you bring home the
baby, bring home a receiving blanket with the baby’s smell on it
(don’t wash it after the baby uses it) and let the Dachshund get to
know the smell on the blanket. Then, when you bring the baby
home, hold the baby and dog and let them check each other out.
It’s also a good idea to keep a treat jar in the nursery. This will help
your dog associate the new addition to the family with positive
rewards. She’ll welcome the crying of a newborn, even in the
middle of the night, if it means a treat may be involved.
And don’t forget to pay your Dachshund lots of attention. She’ll be
confused about the change in the family, and she’ll wonder why
you’re suddenly so busy. Reassure her that she still has an impor-
tant place in the family order, and maintain those training sessions,
which double as bonding sessions during this potentially stressful
time (see the chapters of Part III).
Dachs-proofing your other pets
Got cats? Dachshunds love them, especially Miniature Dachshunds
(see Figure 7-2). Got other dogs? Dachshunds love them, too.
However, introductions shouldn’t be too sudden.
Figure 7-2: Most Dachshunds get along with cats just fine, with proper 
introductions.

One good way to introduce your new Dachshund and your other
pets is to let each pet hang around in a room where the other pet
has been for a while before letting them see each other. One vet I
know suggests keeping them in separate rooms with a door
between them so they can hear each other before they see each
other. Curiosity may eventually get the better of any aggressive
impulses.
Another suggestion is placing one of the pets in a large crate in the
middle of the room while the other is free to roam around, and
then switching roles. This can lead to a smoother introduction as
each pet gets used to the presence of the other in a controlled way.
As with many dogs, unneutered males may not get along well with
each other, and unspayed females may not, either. Best to have at
least one (and I suggest all) of your pets altered (see Chapter 16).
Mastering Dachshund-Friendly
Décor
Here’s the really fun part. For many people, Dachshunds are 
more than pets. They’re a way of life. Beyond Dachs-proofing your
home, you can actually design your home around and for your
Dachshund. Why not? If you’ve been in search of a decorating
theme, this one’s a lot of fun.
Making your home a 
Dachshund haven
Your home can be more than safe. It can be a Dachshund dream
house. When you’re Dachs-proofing your home, I recommend that
you get down on your belly and look around for potential hazards
(see Chapter 6). You can do the same thing to make your Dachsie’s
dream house — this time getting down there to look for what a
Dachshund would like to see.
Low furniture, lots of cushions, a Dachshund-sized sofa, enclosed
pet beds that give a sense of security (cat beds are good for Minis),
and lots of blankets and quilts for burrowing all make Dachshunds
feel at home. Who doesn’t love a little luxury?
Chapter 7: Dachs-Proofing Your Family 91

One of the great things about Dachshunds is that they don’t have
that typical doggy smell so characteristic of other hound breeds. 
In fact, Dachshunds usually appear exceptionally clean (unless
you’ve just been tramping through the mud with yours). You might
as well just give in and let her up on the sofa!
A feeding station kept scrupulously clean, a low doggy door for
outdoor forays, a grooming center (especially for longhairs and
wirehairs), and a dish of gourmet dog biscuits (for special occa-
sions only) add the finishing touches to your Dachshund’s haven.
Some of your décor can be just for you, even if your Dachshund
doesn’t appreciate it. Collecting Dachshund paraphernalia is fun
(see the following section). For some reason, you can find more
Dachshund-specific stuff out there than you can find for most
other breeds. (Maybe it’s their irresistible shape!) Dog-themed 
decorating items are abundantly available, from wallpaper with
dog footprints to dog-printed bedding sets. If you’re a dog person
through and through (or if you’re fast becoming one), why not
show your true colors?
Dachshund paraphernalia: 
A collector’s dream!
From framed Dachshund folk art to antique Dachshund-shaped
boot scrapers, Dachshunds make for a great decorating theme and
great collecting opportunities. Scan antique shops and flea mar-
kets for Dachshund items. Tell dealers what you’re looking for, and
they may be able to point you in the right direction. You can also
purchase Dachshund paraphernalia on the Web. Check out the fol-
lowing Web sites:
 Distinctively Dachshund at www.disdox.com. This site has
Basset Hound stuff, too.
 Dachshund Delights at www.doxidelight.com.
 Dachshund Treasures at www.dachshundtreasures.com.
 Dachshund Gifts at www.dachsundgifts.com.
 You can also find a lot of Dachshund stuff on general gift sites,
collectibles sites, or dog merchandise sites. Or, you can
search for Dachshund on www.ebay.com for hours of wiener-
dog browsing. (Hey, it’s more fun than playing solitaire.)

Chapter 8
Purchasing Your Dachshund
Essentials
In This Chapter
 Finding a den that’s truly home sweet home
 Perusing the must-haves and why-nots of pet supplies
 Picking up grooming tools and toys
 Deciding what to feed your Dachshund
I
f you love shopping, this chapter is for you. And even if you
don’t, no need to despair. Many pet catalogs and Internet sites
are at your service! This chapter is all about pet supplies — what
you and your Dachshund need and what you don’t necessarily
need but think would be awfully fun to have. Every dog needs a few
basics, and Dachshunds require a few special supplies. And then
there are the luxuries. If you can afford them, go for it. If you prefer
to keep your dog budget in check, your Dachshund won’t mind. All
she really wants is attention from you (along with exercise and a
few good meals every day, of course).
You may be getting a little nervous. You’ve browsed over all the
main topics in this chapter, and you’re thinking, “How will I afford
all this stuff?” You don’t have to have everything on Day 1 (for
more on the first day, see Chapter 9). Food and a den are all you
really need at first. Grooming tools and toys should follow soon
after, though. You can probably spread out your new dog pur-
chases over a month or two, but do budget for them because 
your Dachshund is worth it. You’ve made a commitment to give
her the best care, which doesn’t mean ignoring her needs in order
to save a few pennies. It means spending what’s necessary to
ensure her good health and happiness. You’d do the same for a
child, wouldn’t you?

Every Dog Needs a Den!
One of the most important pet supplies you’ll buy — and should
buy — before bringing your new Dachshund home is a crate.
Personally, I don’t like the word “crate.” It sounds like something
that should contain cartons of milk or oranges from Florida, not a
living, breathing, beloved pet. It also conjures up images of cruel
confinement, which is exactly what a lot of people imagine when
they’re told they ought to buy them.
Truth is, a “crate” will become your Dachshund’s second best
friend (after you, of course). Dogs are den animals, and they feel
most secure when they have an enclosed, familiar place to retire to
or to escape the fray of family life once in a while. So, I call crates
dens instead, because as far as Dachshunds are concerned, that’s
exactly what they are. (Dens are also invaluable housetraining
tools.)
Never leave a brand-new puppy in her den for more than two or
three hours, even at night. Older puppies can last about four
hours. If you work all day, someone should come home at lunch to
give your pet a potty break. Even adult dogs, although they can
last eight or nine hours in a den, prefer not to spend all day in con-
finement. If you’re gone every day for nine or ten hours, consider
hiring a dog walker or pet sitter to do the lunch duty.
Why dens are kind
Do you ever wish you could be magically transported to a luxuri-
ous bubble bath or steam room or peaceful meditation retreat, far
from the shrieks of small children, ringing telephones, and mal-
functioning appliances? Your Dachshund feels a little like that
sometimes. Well, maybe not exactly. No one can say for certain
how a dog feels (although some people are pretty sure they can
tell, from time to time). But dogs do get overwhelmed, seem to
suffer from stress, and, although social creatures, sometimes
prefer to be alone. But your Dachshund won’t take a bubble bath
at will. Instead, when a dog is feeling overcome by commotion or
simply needs some downtime, nothing feels better than retiring
into the safety and comfort of the good ol’ den.
Let your pet spend some time each day in her den, even when
you’re home, so that she learns that den doesn’t equal you going
away. She may dislike it at first, but after it becomes familiar, her
den will surely be her favorite spot. Unless your dog is sick and
needs your help, let the den truly be hers by never putting your
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
94

hand in there. The less intrusive you are when it comes to your
Dachshund’s space, the more she’ll feel secure in that space.
After you teach your Dachshund that her den is home sweet home
(see Chapter 9 for more tips), you’ll discover other ways the den
can benefit both you and your Dachshund. For instance, the den
will help your Dachshund learn to avoid accidents. Dogs don’t like
to soil where they sleep, so as long as you don’t wait too long, your
puppy usually will refrain from relieving herself until you take her
outside. (Turn to Chapter 13 for more on housetraining.)
Also, if you have a little beggar under your table, your dog can
spend time in her den when your family has dinner. It’s a lot easier
to keep the kids from slipping your Dachshund people food when
you don’t have a Dachshund in the kitchen, nosing around. Putting
her in her den at dinnertime is kind to your pet, because it keeps
her healthier and won’t encourage bad begging habits.
Selecting your den
You can purchase a crate or kennel for your Dachshund at most
pet stores or even at discount-type department stores. You can
also find a huge variety of pet housing on the Internet, ranging in
price from $15.00 or $20.00 to almost $100.00, depending on the
brand, the design, and the store.
When purchasing a Dachshund den, look for a sturdy, well-venti-
lated plastic or metal crate with an easy-open door (easy for you to
open, not your Dachshund). You want to find a size just big enough
that your Dachshund can stand, sit, lie down, and turn around
comfortably, but you don’t want one so huge that she can relieve
herself in one corner and sleep in another.
Because Dachshunds never get too big, get a crate that’s big
enough to house her as an adult. If it looks like too much space for
your puppy, you can put a small box or toy or pillow in the den to
fill up the extra space. Some crates come with dividers so you can
“grow” the den as your puppy grows.
When you have a den picked out, fold up a blanket or buy a nice,
soft cushion or pad for the bottom, and your Dachsie paradise is
all set.
Plastic dens may not be particularly lovely pieces of furniture
(although some brands look attractive), but to most Dachshunds,
plastic dens feel more secure and safe on the inside than open-wire
kennels, which don’t resemble dens very closely. But wire kennels
Chapter 8: Purchasing Your Dachshund Essentials 95

can work just fine if you drape a blanket over the top and three
sides to give your pet a better sense of security. Also, avoid making
your dog stand on a wire grate; the surface is uncomfortable, and
puppies can snag their toes. Cover the bottom of the den with
something soft — a cushion, pad, pillow, or folded blanket — and
wash the material often.
A companion to dens: 
Dog beds for Dachsies
If you’re talking aesthetics, dog beds (see Figure 8-1 for an example)
are much nicer looking than crates and kennels. Some Dachshunds
love them — especially the beds that are more enclosed. (Many
Dachshunds, especially Minis, like those cushy, semi-enclosed cat
beds.) If you want to (and can) get yours used to a bed, that’s fine.
You can buy some beautiful ones — even furniture-quality wooden
beds sized just for small dogs.
Figure 8-1: Some Dachshunds, like these longhairs, like to call 
dog beds home.
But even if your dog sleeps in a dog bed, she’ll still appreciate and
use a den. You’ll appreciate it, too, when you suddenly need to
confine your Dachshund for her own safety, when housetraining
becomes a nightmare, or when you find that your Dachshund
won’t come out from under the kitchen chair because it’s the clos-
est thing to an enclosed den she can find.

Shop ’Til You Drop: A Pet 
Store Checklist
A den is a must. But what other supplies do you need to properly
care for a Dachshund? In this section, I cover all the options — the
must-haves and the why-nots. Take the following lists to the pet
store (or log on to your favorite online pet store) and have fun!
Collecting the “must-haves”
Following is your list of pet supply staples. These items are pretty
much non-negotiable. Your Dachshund needs them. You can spend
a little or a lot on, say, a leash or a food bowl. You can even buy
most of the supplies at garage sales or borrow them from friends
who no longer have dogs. But you need to find the following items,
one way or the other:
 Food: Buy as good a food as you can afford (see the later sec-
tion “Kibble, Kibble, Everywhere . . .” for more about what to
feed your Dachshund).
 Leash (or lead): Dachshunds must be kept on a leash when
near traffic or in an unenclosed area. Keep your pet safe. You
don’t need to spend a lot. Four-foot lengths are good for new
puppies. When your dog gets older, a 6-foot length is perfect.
Choose leather or nylon, whichever you prefer.
 Collar or harness: A leash isn’t much good without a color 
or harness. Harnesses are nice for Dachshunds because you
won’t risk pulling on your pet’s neck. Don’t leave a harness 
on all the time, though. It can rub away at your dog’s coat.
Collars give you a little more control, and some dogs seem to
prefer them.
A collar for identification tags and a harness just for walks is
the perfect combination!
 Identification tags: You probably already know that your
short-legged hound dog shouldn’t go wandering around the
neighborhood, but just in case your little rascal digs out of
your backyard or dashes through an open door and gets away
from you, an identification tag can drastically improve your
Dachsie’s chances for a safe return home. Most pet stores
have forms you can fill out to order ID tags, or you can look in
magazines and pet catalogs.
Chapter 8: Purchasing Your Dachshund Essentials 97

Collars and ID tags can fall off, break off, or get lost. Or per-
haps your Dachshund could escape on that one day you 
took off her collar, “just for a minute.” For these reasons, a
microchip or tattoo may be a better ID tool. Some animal shel-
ters and rescue groups require that your dog have one of
these (see Chapter 5). Microchips encoded with your dog’s
contact information are implanted under her skin, usually in
her neck. Vets and shelters with scanners can scan found
dogs to see if they contain chips. Tattoos identify your dog
with a code on her ear, abdomen, or thigh. Anyone who finds
your dog can contact a national database to find out where
she belongs. Talk to your vet about the best identification
method for your Dachshund.
 Food and water bowls: Any style bowl will do, as long as 
it’s unbreakable and heavy enough so that your Dachshund
doesn’t keep knocking it over when she tries to eat. Weighted
bowls, ceramic bowls, and metal bowls are good choices.
Avoid plastic bowls, which can harbor bacteria and even lead
to skin infections.
 Shampoo: Even if you don’t use it very often (you don’t need
to bathe a smooth hair unless she gets really dirty), you should
have shampoo on hand for those times when you need it. Use
a shampoo made for pets, not for people. People shampoo is
harsh and can irritate your pet’s skin and eyes. (See Chapter
16 for more on grooming.)
 Toothbrush and toothpaste: It may seem silly to you, but
brushing your dog’s teeth is essential for her good health.
Brushing keeps tartar buildup at bay (excessive tartar buildup
must be removed by a vet, often under general anaesthetic,
which is always a risk). Tooth decay and bacteria in your
dog’s mouth can lead to heart disease and other serious
health problems — especially as your Dachshund ages.
Look for a toothbrush and toothpaste made just for dogs.
People toothpaste isn’t good for your Dachshund. A people
toothbrush may work, but dog toothbrushes are longer with
more compact, sturdier bristles, and they’re angled in a way
that makes brushing easier.
You can also buy pet toothbrushes that slip over your finger.
For that matter, a gauze pad wrapped around your finger makes
an effective toothbrush, and most dogs don’t mind you rub-
bing their teeth this way — especially if you get them used to
the process while they’re puppies.
 Nail clippers: A dog with long nails risks a foot injury. Long
nails on hard surfaces spread the footpads too far apart. They
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
98

also make walking more difficult. Keep your dog’s nails nicely
trimmed with a pair of clippers. Ask your vet to show you how
to clip (or have it done professionally once every four to eight
weeks). Buy clippers made for dogs, not for humans. Human
nail clippers can seriously injure your dog and probably aren’t
strong enough to cut your dog’s nails anyway.
 Brush and comb: Your dog’s specific grooming needs depend
on what coat she has (see the section “Choosing Tools for the
Well-Groomed Dachshund” later in this chapter), but a good
natural bristle brush and a steel comb will work for all coat
types.
 Pet gate: A pet gate is a must-have if you have rooms where
your Dachshund isn’t allowed or stairs you want to keep her
from descending or climbing. Baby gates, pet gates — same
thing.
Garage sales are good sources for buying gates, because
people often sell their baby gates when their kids get older.
 Toys: Dachshunds (like girls) just want to have fun! (I can say
that because I’m a girl.) A few toys are a must-have, even if
they’re homemade (see the section “Toys for Playtime!” later
in this chapter).
 Pet stain and odor remover: Accidents happen, but if your
dog smells a previous mistake on your carpet, accidents will
happen again and again. Many pet products will truly remove
the scent of a past indiscretion. Take advantage and make
housetraining easier. Ask your local pet store employee to 
recommend a brand for your Dachshund.
Most Dachshund vets and breeders generally don’t recommend
vitamin supplements. Supplements can throw off the nutritional
balance of your pet’s diet. Unless your vet specifically prescribes
something for your Dachshund, stick with the healthy, complete,
nutritionally balanced food recommended by your vet, as well as
occasional healthy treats. If your Dachshund has a health problem,
a holistic vet may recommend supplements like glucosamine for
joint health or probiotics for improved digestion.
Giving the “why-nots” a whirl
Beyond the must-haves are the “why-nots” — the pet supplies that
are more luxury than necessity. If you want to spend the money,
why not? Some of the items in the following list satisfy some pets
more than others, and some are, admittedly, just for your own
amusement and pleasure. But that’s worth something, too!
Chapter 8: Purchasing Your Dachshund Essentials 99

 Gourmet dog treats: Fancy gourmet dog treats from dedi-
cated dog bakeries are now widely available. If you live in a
big city, you may live near a dog bakery. Here in Iowa, we have
three different dog treat bakers at the local farmer’s market!
Browse around and pick out a few special treats for your
Dachshund.
Don’t overfeed your Dachsie, even if the treats are healthy.
Many gourmet treats are all-natural and made of human-grade
ingredients, but that isn’t an excuse to let your Dachshund
binge. A calorie is a calorie, no matter the source. One treat
every day or so should be fine, but you may want to consider
decreasing the kibble allowance on those days just slightly.
 Puppy training pads: Some people like to use pre-scented
puppy pads that encourage a Dachshund to go on them rather
than the carpet. Not every dog responds to these pads, but if
the pads work for your puppy, they can help a lot with house-
training.
 Retractable leash: This is a very long leash that retracts into
a plastic case with a handle. Retractable leashes are perfect
for walks or hikes in parks, forests, or other natural areas
where your Dachshund will love to go sniffing about. You can
keep her safe while she explores.
A retractable leash isn’t for everyday use, however, because it
isn’t good for teaching your dog to heel (see Chapter 14). And
be sure to follow the directions when you retract so the leash
doesn’t whip around and hit you. Safety first!
Don’t bring your Dachshund to the vet on a retractable leash.
There are so many distractions at the vet’s office, and many
dogs wander too far from their owners and too close to others
on this kind of leash.
 Dog bed and other dog furniture: Yes, companies make dog
furniture. Little chairs, little beds, little fainting couches — 
all very lovely and impressive, and all pretty expensive. But
what better way to make your home a Dachshund haven? Of
course, if you drop a bundle on a fancy bedroom set for your
Dachshund, be prepared. She may ignore it and prefer to curl
up on the people couch instead. After all, that’s where you sit!
 Fancy clothing: A Dachshund in clothes? Sure! Doggy fashion
is big these days — from collars, bows, and sweaters to jack-
ets, coats, and boots — and boutique-y pet stores are full of
options. Dress your dog to match her unique personality.
Behold Figure 8-2 for an example!
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
100

Figure 8-2: For some this is high fashion, and for others it’s campy fun.
If you live in a very cold climate, a few articles of clothing 
are actually more of a necessity than a luxury. Dog sweaters,
jackets, or coats can keep your Dachshund warm on cold
winter walks. Dog boots keep ice crystals and rock salt from
getting between your Dachshund’s footpads (they also pro-
tect your pet from sharp rocks and hot surfaces on summer
hikes). The question is, can you get your dog to wear them? 
If yours won’t, always wipe your Dachshund’s paws with a
warm cloth or even a baby wipe after winter walks. Even when
it isn’t snowing, rock salt and ice crystal residue can get
between your dog’s paws.
Choosing Tools for the Well-
Groomed Dachshund
If you have a smooth Dachshund, you don’t need much in the way
of grooming tools. Longhairs and wirehairs require a little more —
especially if you decide to do all the dog grooming yourself (see
Chapter 3 for more on coat type). You can talk to your vet or a
local groomer for tips on which grooming tools are best for your
dog; for now, this section provides a short list of tools for you. (For
more info on how to groom your Dachshund, see Chapter 16.)
Chapter 8: Purchasing Your Dachshund Essentials 101

Smooth grooming tools
Grooming a smooth Dachshund may be easy, but you still need a
few tools of the trade:
 Natural-bristled brush
 Hound mitt — which has bristles sewn onto the palm — for
pulling out shed hair
 Spray oil made for dog coats — if you want to make your
Dachshund’s coat look extra shiny (a common practice for
show dogs)
You can also use a little baby oil and your hands — but just a
drop or two
 Moisturizing shampoo for smooths with dry skin
Longhaired grooming tools
Grooming a longhaired Dachshund is mostly a matter of keeping 
all those tiny little tangles from becoming great big mats. It takes a
little skill and practice, but mostly it takes a commitment to regular
grooming — preferably a comb-through every day.
Several books give good instructions on grooming longhaired
Dachshunds for the show ring or for pet homes, but nothing 
beats watching someone who knows the ropes demonstrate for
you. Your breeder may be the best person to show you; a profes-
sional dog groomer may also be willing to illustrate the basics. 
You can also talk to breeders at a dog show for tips and 
demonstrations.
Professionals may recommend additional tools, but here are the
basic tools for grooming a longhair:
 Spray conditioner to use before brushing and combing
 Pin brush and/or a natural bristle brush
 Fine-toothed steel comb to work out all the tangles
 Straight scissors with blunt tips for trimming long paw hair
and neatening the ends of the coat
 Mat splitter (hopefully you won’t need it!)
 Shampoo with conditioner or crème rinse to keep tangles 
at bay
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
102

Wirehaired grooming tools
If you don’t care about keeping your dog looking like a show dog, a
wirehaired Dachsie can get by with an electric clipper shave when-
ever her wiry coat gets out of hand. If you want your dog to look
ready for the show ring, however, you need a few other tools —
including your thumb and forefinger, which you’ll use periodically
to pluck the longer hairs from your Dachshund’s coat (it doesn’t
hurt her), or a stripping knife.
Just as with longhairs, you’ll learn a lot by watching a pro demon-
strate for you. (See Chapter 16 for more information about groom-
ing the wirehaired Dachshund.) The list of wirehair grooming tools
is short, but the grooming process is long:
 Natural bristle brush
 Steel comb
 Stripping knife (optional — you can also use your fingers)
 Scissors for neatening stray hairs
 Clippers with a variety of blades, including a #10
Toys for Playtime!
Dachshunds, like all dogs, need toys. Play is a puppy’s work and
the means by which she learns about the world. But not all toys
are created equal. The following list presents the best ones you
should buy (or make) for your Dachshund:
 Something very hard and appealing to chew on, like a hard
rubber Kong toy. The Kongs are great. They have holes you can
fill with dog treats or other tantalizing things; your Dachshund
may work all day at trying to get the treat out of the Kong.
 Something with more “give” to chew on, like a Nylabone or
Gummabone chew toy.
 Something soft, like a made-for-dogs fleece toy. Sure, your
Dachshund probably will shred it and pull out all the stuffing,
but she’ll have a whole lot of fun doing it!
Be very careful with dolls or stuffed animals with plastic parts
or eyes that can come off and pose a choking hazard.
 A ball or other object to chase, if your Dachshund likes to
chase or retrieve.
Chapter 8: Purchasing Your Dachshund Essentials 103

Tug of war with a rope toy may sound like fun, but you should
avoid playing this game with your Dachshund. The sharp back-and-
forth movement can injure her back — even resulting in paralysis.
Plus, some experts believe tug-of-war games can lead to posses-
sion aggression, which can become a major behavioral problem
that’s hard to correct. Stick to ball chasing.
Kibble, Kibble, Everywhere . . .
In the long run, dog food will turn out to be your most expensive
pet supply, so you don’t want to waste your money. But you do
want to choose the best food that you can afford. Choosing the
right food for your Dachshund may seem pretty tricky. So many
brands! Should you choose a natural food? A meat-based or a
grain-based food? And what about making your own dog food 
at home?
The publicity you hear and read about dog diets and pet food
safety is indeed overwhelming, and eventually you’ll have to make
a decision. I can tell you what I’ve learned after several years of
research and writing many articles on the subject — which I do in
the following sections — but in the end, the choice is up to you
because the experts don’t always agree. The best you can do is
find a food that satisfies all the following requirements:
 Your dog likes it.
 You can afford it.
 Your vet recommends it.
 It is nutritionally complete.
Which commercial food is best?
If you choose to feed your dog dry kibble — the easiest option —
the number of choices is astounding. Corn-based, meat-based,
hypoallergenic, natural, meat meal, fresh meat, by-products, no
meat, human-grade ingredients — how do you pick? Well, your 
first job is to learn how to read the labels. The following list
explains how:
 Look for kibble that lists meat or meat meal as the first
ingredient, and preferably also as the second and/or third
ingredient. Fresh meat and meat meal are both high-quality
protein sources.
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
104

Meat by-products have protein and also things dogs in the
wild may eat (organs, bone, skin, cartilage), but they also may
contain ingredients that aren’t good for your dog. You really
don’t know what you’re getting, and many (but not all) vets
discourage the use of food with by-products. Talk to your vet
if this issue concerns you.
Some people are enthusiastic about vegetarian diets for dogs,
but others believe this diet is unnatural and even unsafe for
dogs. I haven’t researched the subject enough to recommend it.
 Avoid grain-based foods. Although whole grains in modera-
tion are probably just fine for your dog (some people don’t
think they are), highly processed grains or foods made mostly
with grains may not contain adequate amounts of digestible
protein. Some people also believe that grains cause skin aller-
gies in many dogs.
 Look for words you understand, like “blueberries” and
“salmon oil” and “kelp.” Plenty of chemical names should
give you pause. Although not all chemicals are bad for your
dog (and many added vitamins sound like chemicals), it
makes sense to me that dogs (and people, too) are designed
to eat foods as close to their natural state as possible.
 Look for a food that’s naturally preserved with vitamins 
E and C rather than chemical preservatives. The verdict is
still out on the effects of chemical preservatives, but naturally
preserved food is so widely available that I don’t see any
reason to take a chance.
 If you find a food advertised as being “nutritionally com-
plete,” it must include a statement on the label that says it’s
appropriate for the maintenance and/or growth stages (in
other words, for adult dogs and/or for puppies). If your food
of choice doesn’t say that, it hasn’t passed the test and isn’t
meant to be a dog’s complete diet.
Even better is a statement that the food has been subjected to
feeding trials by the dog food company and has been proven
to be nutritionally adequate.
If you’re feeling confused, here’s some general advice: Find a good,
quality kibble, naturally preserved, with meat listed first or second
on the ingredient list, and that your dog likes. The higher priced
foods probably are better and actually may be a bargain, because
your Dachshund won’t have to eat as much of them to get the
same amount of nutrition. Plus, cheap foods tend to make for
bulky, stinky poop. Premium foods make your Dachshund’s waste
much nicer to handle. When in doubt, ask your vet to recommend
a food she prefers for her own dogs.
Chapter 8: Purchasing Your Dachshund Essentials 105

Most breeders and vets don’t recommend canned food over kibble
for several reasons. It’s more expensive, it’s less nutritionally dense,
and some think it can promote tooth decay. But it does taste better,
and some picky eaters prefer a spoonful of high-quality canned food
mixed in with their kibble. As long as the types of food you give your
Dachshund are high in quality, you’ll be fine (especially if you brush
your Dachshund’s teeth every day).
Organic, raw, frozen . . . 
does it matter?
Lately, a lot of information is being passed around about organic
diets, raw-food diets, and frozen prepared raw diets. Holistic pet
food is trendy, but a lot of the hype comes from some pretty sensi-
ble ideas — namely that rather than chemicals, a dog’s diet should
contain food in a form as close as possible to the things a dog
would eat in the wild. It may be worthwhile, although no studies
have shown this yet.
The problem is, organic food is much more expensive, although
people who choose organic foods for themselves and their families
are often happy to pay the higher price.
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
106
Popular beliefs about food variety
Perhaps you’ve heard that you should never switch your dog’s food, or if you do,
you should do so gradually. Perhaps you’ve also heard that your dog doesn’t require
any food but her own brand of kibble and that she should never be given anything
else.
Not everyone agrees with this point of view. Dogs don’t eat the same thing every
day in the wild. And, personally, I find it hard to believe that the occasional addition
of healthy people food — especially meat, because very few brands of kibble con-
tain the proportion of meat nature intended for dogs to eat — will do any Dachshund
harm. Sure, if you overdo the treats, you could encourage obesity; the trick is to
keep the calories down and the nutritional density up. For example, avoid giving all
the chicken skin or fat trimmings from your steak to your Dachshund; give him some
of the meat instead. Regarding switching your dog’s food gradually, yes, any change
in diet should be done gradually. Dogs with sensitive systems are more likely to
react adversely to dietary changes than normal, healthy dogs.

Many people worry that raw-food diets — whether they’re home-
made or frozen prepared meals that you can buy in pet stores (they
keep them in freezers) — put dogs at risk of food poisoning. Vets
are deeply divided on this subject, so you should talk to your vet
before you make a decision on this type of diet. Many Dachshunds
with horrible skin allergies have improved dramatically on raw-
food diets, but for others, it doesn’t seem to make any difference —
it could even make them sick. Only you and your vet can decide
what’s right for your Dachsie.
What about homemade diets?
Considering making your dog’s food at home out of natural,
healthy ingredients? Sounds appealing, yes, but it’s time consum-
ing. Of course, if you have one 6-pound Miniature Dachshund,
you’ll spend a lot less time making her food than if you have a
house full of Standards.
The only problem with homemade diets is that if they aren’t nutri-
tionally complete, your dog can suffer. For example, a dog fed only
meat will eventually experience severe health problems. More
subtle nutritional deficiencies can happen, too, if your dog misses
any essential nutrients.
Getting into the finer points of the homemade diet is beyond the
scope of this book, but I can highly recommend a couple books on
the subject that will tell you exactly what to do if you want to make
your dog’s food at home. These books are also filled with great
general health information on dogs:

No matter how much your Dachsie begs, never give her a taste of
that chocolate bar or chocolate chip cookie. Chocolate can cause
dehydration and diarrhea that’s difficult to treat and deadly if not
caught in time. Dogs must also avoid onions, grapes, and raisins,
which can all cause toxic reactions.

The First Day: What to Do 
and What to Expect
In This Chapter
 Driving your Dachshund home
 Delivering the grand tour
 Getting through the first night
 Establishing your new routine the next day
 Finding a vet for your Dachsie
You have the den. You have the food. You have the chew toys.
And now, much to your joy, you have the Dachshund. Yikes!
Suddenly, the responsibility hits you: You have a dog. Now you get
to take him home and begin your new life — your Dachshund-full
life. And you feel like you aren’t even sure how to make it home
with that tiny, dependent puppy in your vehicle. Don’t worry. This
chapter talks you through your first day with your Dachsie, step by
step. In a few short days, you’ll be feeling like a pro.
The first few weeks with a new puppy can be pretty challenging,
and you may sometimes wish you hadn’t signed on for this job! But
keep your eye on the prize. When you and your Dachshund finally
work out the rules and understand each other, life will suddenly
become sweet. You’ll wonder what you ever worried about. “I have
such a good dog,” you’ll tell your friends. But first, you have to 
get through the first day. The chapters of Part III dig deep into the
topic of training, so head there after you get through the first day!
Taking the First Ride Home
Of course you want to cuddle your new puppy all the way home,
but try to refrain. First of all, cute as he is and as much as you want

to hold and cuddle him, he needs to be restrained safely in your
car. You’d restrain your infant when bringing him home from the
hospital, wouldn’t you? Besides, in some states, the law says that
you must.
Most states, however, don’t require your dog to be restrained just
yet. You can make it a family rule, though, and everyone will be
safer if you do.
The two main types of pet restraints are harness seatbelts that
attach to the car’s seatbelts — with or without tethers that attach
to the harness — and pet carriers with slots so car seatbelts can
hold them securely in place. Pet carriers probably are best for
brand-new puppies, because they may feel more secure to a nerv-
ous Dachshund. But either type is safe. (Pet carriers also are good
for older Dachshunds that tend to chew destructively. Don’t think
they aren’t capable of chewing up the seats while you’re concen-
trating on the road!)
If you get in a traffic accident, you probably won’t be able to hold
on to your dog. He can be thrown around inside the vehicle, injur-
ing or killing himself or other passengers. Plus, your dog can serve
as a major distraction, possibly causing you to get in a traffic 
accident.
Nobody thinks they’ll get into an accident, of course. Unfortunately,
many people do. Knowing that, I can’t think of a single argument
not to buckle up your Dachsie — especially because dog seatbelts
and pet carriers are so widely available and inexpensive.
According to a 2004 American Animal Hospital Association pet
owner survey, 67 percent of pet owners say they travel with their
pets, and 37 percent sometimes bring their pets to work with them.
Buckle up, everyone!
Welcoming Your Dachshund Home
When you arrive safely at home, a real welcome is in order! Life has
just changed dramatically for both your family and that little dog 
in your arms, so go ahead and make a bit of a fuss. You don’t want
to overwhelm your new dog, of course, but you do want to show
him around, acquaint him with his new turf, and do what you can
to let him know that he’s in a loving and safe environment with
your family. The following sections help you pull out the welcome
wagon.
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
110

Puppies, like babies, are relatively simple creatures. They need
sleep, food, water, love, and guidance. As long as you provide these
five things on the first day (and for the rest of your puppy’s life,
although later his needs will expand), you’re on the right track.
Giving the grand tour
First on your welcome-home list is the grand tour. This event is for
you and your new pet, helping you to realize and acknowledge the
changing nature of your family. Take your Dachshund from room to
room and show him what is his. Your new Dachshund will want to
see the Dachsie dining area, the sleeping quarters, the toys, the . . .
hold on a minute! Aren’t you forgetting something? That little guy
probably has to piddle. Make your selected bathroom place your
first stop.
First stop: Elimination station
Dogs like to eliminate in the same place all the time, if they can. If
you provide your puppy with a spot in the yard just for this pur-
pose and take him there as soon as you get home — even before
you go inside the house — you’ll set the groundwork for house-
training success.
Pick a spot in the yard, put your Dachsie down, and let him sniff
around and explore (keep that leash on if your yard isn’t fenced).
He may pick a different spot; unless it’s the middle of your flower
garden or some other objectionable place, let him choose. If he
eliminates, praise him. If he doesn’t, give it a few minutes. If he still
doesn’t eliminate, take him inside but don’t put him down on the
floor. Bring him back out 10 or 15 minutes later and try again. Keep
this up until he does his duty. If you can keep him from having an
accident indoors the first day, you’ve made great progress.
I explain crate training, or the method of using his den to teach
your puppy how to control his bladder, in more detail in Chapter
13. For now, take your puppy outside to his elimination station fre-
quently for the first few days — approximately every two hours —
especially on day one. Soon, he’ll learn what that special spot in
the yard is for.
Some people prefer to paper-train their Dachshunds — take the
dog to the newspaper or puppy-training pad indoors, rather than
outside, when it’s potty time. That’s fine. On the first day, just pick
a spot, spread out a newspaper, and take your Dachshund there
first thing — and about every two hours after that. A scented
Chapter 9: The First Day: What to Do and What to Expect 111

puppy-training pad (see Chapter 8) may encourage elimination. 
Put it over the newspaper for added protection.
Your breeder may have used newspapers for the puppies to elimi-
nate on, so even if you aren’t paper-training your Dachshund in 
the house, don’t line his den with newspapers. They may signal to
your Dachshund that the den is his elimination station, and that’s
not what you want. Choose a comfy blanket or cushion for the
crate.
Second stop: The Dachshund dining room
Next up is the dining area. Kitchens and bathrooms are good for
puppy food and water bowls because, frankly, puppies aren’t the
neatest eaters. Set up a big water bowl before you pup gets home
(though not too big — your puppy shouldn’t have to strain to get a
drink) and keep it full of clean water at all times.
After your puppy has eliminated in the yard, bring him in and feed
him. When you get home, after the initial shock, your puppy will
probably be hungry. Puppies need to eat more often than adult
dogs, so if you have a puppy, feed him at least three times a day.
(Make sure that you don’t feed more than the daily amount recom-
mended by your vet, including treats; see Chapter 8.)
A new dog has a lot on his plate, so to speak, so he may not be
very hungry the first day. However, puppies, especially Minis, can’t
afford to go for a day or two without food. If your puppy refuses to
eat for more than 12 hours or acts listless, tired, or very shy or
scared, call your vet immediately. He could be sick and may
require treatment.
Third stop: The rest of the home
After a nice meal, your Dachsie is probably ready to explore the
rest of the house. You’ll show him his sleeping quarters later, but
for now, take him into all the rooms in which he’ll be allowed. If
he’s a young puppy, you may want to limit him, initially, to just a
room or two. Keep him on a leash if he seems nervous, and let him
explore without interruptions from curious kids or other pets.
Show him all the Dachshund-safe areas of the house, and don’t
forget to give him another bathroom break, about 15 or 20 minutes
after his meal.
By now, your Dachshund may have figured out that there are some
other interesting creatures around. Time for introductions!
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
112

Meeting the family
After your dog gets the lay of the land, it’s time for him to meet the
inhabitants. Introduce the members of your family one by one.
Your Dachshund can become overwhelmed if everyone crowds
around at once, so let each family member (especially kids)
approach slowly and gently, speaking in quiet, soothing voices.
Some puppies are fine with a little chaos, but introducing your new
member to the family one at a time gives him a chance to sniff each
person’s hand, check out each person’s face, and enjoy a stroke or
two. This approach may help your puppy learn who’s who with a
little more ease.
Don’t pass your puppy around just yet. Let him sniff from the
safety of your arms or the floor. Children, especially, should never
hold a Dachshund while standing up because of the risk that they
may drop him. Keep introductions on the down-low (in other
words, with kids sitting on the floor).
Approaching the other pets
If you have another dog or cat or two, don’t throw all your pets
together right away. Confine your other pets before bringing your
new Dachshund into the house. Put them in a room with something
that has your new dog’s smell on it — a blanket or mat from his den,
maybe. Let your new Dachshund sniff around your house for at
least an hour or so while the other pets are confined. After they’ve
detected each other by scent, you can bring them face to face.
Hold each pet for a while first to keep the situation controlled.
You may also let each pet have a turn inside a crate while the other
sniffs the surroundings to see what’s going on. Just don’t let your
hands off your new puppy during introductions.
Introducing new pets to resident pets can be tricky. Sometimes
things go off without a hitch, but if somebody gets testy, you need
to be there, immediately ready to separate the two.
Don’t let a tense situation escalate. If either pet seems anxious,
fearful, or aggressive, separate the two and continue to let them
interact for very short sessions (just a few minutes) every few
hours, with both pets firmly under the control of a responsible
adult. Don’t leave them together unsupervised until you’re sure
they’re friendly toward each other.
Chapter 9: The First Day: What to Do and What to Expect 113

Don’t forget to respect your original pet’s space. Your dog or cat
needs reassurance that the new puppy is an addition, not a
replacement. Give your resident pet plenty of love, too!
Allowing for nap time
After the first potty break, the initial tour, snack, and introductions,
your new Dachshund is probably exhausted. Time for a nap. This
is your first opportunity to get your Dachshund used to his den.
Put the den where you plan to keep it and let your puppy sniff
around. Throw a few pieces of kibble inside and let him go in after
them. Don’t slam the door behind him; let him come in and out for
a few minutes. If it’s been awhile, take him outside to his special
bathroom spot for another chance to eliminate. When you return,
be sure the den is lined with a soft blanket, cushion, or mat and
insert your Dachshund. Gently close the door.
You may hear whining. You may hear crying. You may hear frantic
barking. Reassure your puppy in a gentle voice that everything is
okay but that it’s time for a nap. You can stay nearby for a bit if you
don’t make a fuss and you can ignore the whining. When you leave
the room, be strong. Let him whine. He may not know he needs a
break, but he does. Leave him there for at least 20 minutes —
longer if he falls asleep.
When your Dachshund is inside his den, let him be inside. Don’t
talk to him or otherwise disturb him. Because a dog can’t properly
interact with you while in his den, talking to him can cause him
anxiety, especially as he’s getting used to his new situation.
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
114
What if my new Dachshund is an adult?
Adult Dachshunds entering new homes experience the same stress as new pup-
pies. They may or may not be better trained than puppies. They don’t know where
they are or with whom they’re about to share a life. They don’t know where to elim-
inate, where to eat, or where to sleep. And they probably need to get used to a
brand-new den. Follow the same instructions for a new Dachshund of any age; your
new Dachshund will soon be a happy and well-adjusted member of your family,
assuming that he was happy and well-adjusted before. (If not, you may have other
issues to deal with; see Chapter 13.)

When he wakes up, let him out immediately so he doesn’t associ-
ate the den with too much unpleasantness at first. Take him
directly outside to his special spot for a potty break and then come
back in again for more fun and exploration.
Now you can play or try your first training session — something
very simple, such as raising a piece of kibble above your puppy’s
head to make him sit as you say “Sit.” (Chapter 14 has more on
basic commands, including Sit.)
Surviving the First Night
The first night with a new Dachshund puppy, or any new dog, car-
ries its share of burdens and joys. You go to bed, you get up, you
take the puppy out, you go back to bed, you get up, you take the
puppy out, you go back to bed, you get up . . . in between, who can
sleep with that whining and crying? And who can get mad at pup-
pies that don’t seem to need sleep (see Figure 9-1)?
People with new babies don’t sleep much either; fortunately, your
puppy will probably learn to sleep through the night much sooner
than a human infant. And if your Dachshund is older, he’ll learn even
more quickly because he’s simply getting used to a new situation.
Figure 9-1: Sleep? We don’t need no stinking sleep!

You may spend the first night pulling out your hair, wondering
what you’ve gotten yourself into. But don’t call the breeder just yet
to beg for her to take your puppy back. Approach the first night
with optimism and a sense of duty, and you’ll do right by your
Dachshund. Taking your puppy out a couple of times during the
first night is a labor of love and well worth the payoff in the end.
A few strategies can help you sail through that first night, and the
nights to come, with ease. The following sections present these
strategies.
The crying game
One of the hardest parts for dog lovers to endure is the whining.
Your Dachshund will cry, moan, howl, plead, and beg on the first
night. He wants to sleep with you. How can you resist? He sounds
so pitiful, so pathetic, so lonely. If you were in that kennel, you’d
want someone to take you out and cuddle you, too.
But you aren’t in that kennel, and your Dachshund isn’t a human.
Dogs prefer to sleep in enclosed, den-like places. Yours simply
hasn’t grown accustomed to his den yet, and he won’t if you don’t
give him the chance.
If the crying keeps you awake, you can always move your Dachs-
hund to another room, although he’ll probably be happier in the
room with you. If the whining gets frantic, get up and take your
puppy to his special spot in the yard or on the newspaper. Stay
calm and reassuring, but don’t make a big fuss; this will just reward
your Dachshund for his whining.
Don’t ever wake him up to take him out. He needs to learn to sleep
through the night, so let sleeping dogs lie (as they say).
After your Dachshund is trained to sleep through the night without
needing to go out, you have my permission to let him sleep under
the covers with you, unless you really object to the idea. Truth is,
under the covers is where most Dachshunds sleep — whether
their humans originally intended things that way or not.
That doesn’t mean you won’t still use the den. Housetraining, naps
during the day, confinement when you can’t have your dog in the
way, and trips to the vet all make the crate an invaluable resource.
But at night, Dachshunds want to be near their humans and they
love being underneath things, so when yours is sleeping through
the night, you may just decide that the bed is okay. Besides, Dachs-
hunds are insistent. They’re persistent. They very likely will break
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
116

you. And when winter comes, you’ll be glad because there are few
things in life cozier than a warm, snuggly Dachshund next to your
cold feet on a frigid January morning.
But that day hasn’t arrived yet. On the first night, you’re still in the
training stages. When enduring the whining, remember that you
aren’t being cruel; you’re being kind. It just doesn’t feel like it. And
if you do give in and let him sleep with you because you just can’t
stand it, don’t kick yourself. You aren’t the first Dachshund puppy
owner to cave!
In and out, in and out
In general, your puppy needs to go out every two to three hours
during the night if he’s about 8 weeks old — less often if he’s older.
That doesn’t mean he won’t ask to go out more often, however.
He’s lonely and scared, and he doesn’t like being shut in that unfa-
miliar place. If whining can get you out of bed and him out of his
crate, he’ll keep doing it!
Maybe you’ll get lucky. Some puppies sleep straight through the
night or need to go out only once. If yours is more demanding,
don’t despair. Your puppy will soon learn, and in a few days, you’ll
be able to stretch the times between outings to four, six, and, 
hallelujah, eight hours. Most puppies learn in a week or two. Stan-
dards probably will sleep through the night before Minis, just
because they have bigger bladders (see Chapter 3 for more 
differences).
Adult dogs need to eliminate approximately four times per day,
although some get by with fewer trips to the elimination station.
Young puppies need to go more often, but almost always eliminate
sometime within an hour after eating.
Good habits to get into
You can do a few things to help your Dachshund sleep through the
night without the need to eliminate every hour:
 Unless your puppy seems unusually thirsty, limit water con-
sumption after 7 p.m.
 Take your puppy outside to eliminate right before you put him
down for the night.
 Take your puppy out first thing in the morning, at the same
time every day. You can always go back to sleep on the 
Chapter 9: The First Day: What to Do and What to Expect 117

weekends, but your puppy may not be able to hold it if you
decide to sleep in.
 Check your puppy’s bedding frequently in the early days. If he
gets used to sleeping on wet bedding, he’ll be more inclined to
continue having accidents in his crate.
Keep reminding yourself that you’re teaching your puppy to con-
trol his bladder and establish good habits. Then, after he’s learned,
you can relax the reins a bit. In fact, you may even be convinced to
let your Dachshund sleep with you!
The Morning After: 
Starting a Routine
It’s morning . . . already! The sun is up, and you’ve made it through
the first night. Today is your first full day with your new friend. It’s
also the day for setting up the routine you’ll live with most of the
time.
Don’t wait to incorporate your Dachsie into your routine. You don’t
have to make the first few weeks special for your Dachshund. If
you can take time to be home more often, that’s perfect, but don’t
center your entire day around your new dog. When things go back
to normal, your dog won’t understand the sudden change.
Dogs are creatures of habit, and they love routine. Let your new
Dachshund know, from the very first full day, what the schedule
will be. Everyone will get along more easily and happily that way,
and your new dog will be glad to know what to expect. The follow-
ing sections show you the way.
Setting up a family routine
Your new family routine should be a lot like your old family rou-
tine. You simply need to add a few steps here and there. If you’re a
list person, you can write your family’s new schedule on a piece of
paper; insert the following items where they make sense for your
situation.
Young puppies need to go out for a bathroom break about every
two hours during the day and every three to four hours at night, 
so you may need to add more potty breaks to this list (for more on
housetraining, see Chapter 13).
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
118

 Take puppy out (first thing in the morning).
 Give puppy breakfast.
 Take puppy out (about 20 minutes after breakfast).
 Groom puppy.
 Train puppy.
 Pet puppy.
 Give puppy lunch.
 Take puppy out (about 20 minutes after lunch).
 Train puppy again.
 Take puppy for a walk.
 Give puppy dinner.
 Take puppy out (about 20 minutes after dinner).
 Pet puppy.
 Take puppy out (right before bed).
 Put puppy to bed.
 Take puppy out (when necessary in the middle of the night).
Yep, your day is more complicated than it was pre-Dachshund, and
it will take a little more time. That may mean less time for televi-
sion, talking on the phone, or whatever else you do with your
leisure time, but that’s the commitment you made when you
decided to bring a dog into your life.
But keep this in mind: Incorporating your puppy’s routine into your
own is fun. Having a Dachshund around makes life better — just ask
any devoted Dachshund owner. Your time spent will be well worth it.
Also, schedule in some quiet time a few times each day (preferably
at about the same time) with your Dachshund. Pet and talk to him
in a gentle voice without any demands or expectations. Tune out
everything else and focus on your pet. You and your new friend will
both come to anticipate these bonding sessions. Your Dachshund
will grow to feel safe and secure in your presence, and you may
experience some wonderful stress relief. Five minutes twice a day
is plenty. It may well be the best ten minutes of your day!
Becoming creatures of habit
Because dogs respond well to schedules and routines, establishing
a daily order is an important part of making your dog feel like his
Chapter 9: The First Day: What to Do and What to Expect 119

universe is secure and in order. In addition to establishing the rou-
tine, however, you need to make sure that all your tasks occur at
approximately the same times each day.
Keeping a schedule isn’t always easy, but it is important for your
Dachshund, so try your best. Take him out at the same time each
morning, feed him at the same times each day, and train, groom,
walk, and pet him consistently — always in the same order, always
at about the same time. (Okay, you can improvise some on the pet-
ting, but stick with the rest of it!) This kind of life is heaven for a
dog and establishes a firm foundation that will make training
much, much easier.
Grooming: Don’t wait
You may be tempted to wait awhile before grooming your
Dachshund — especially if you have a smooth (see Chapter 3).
Isn’t that too much to do on the first or second day?
Not at all. Grooming is a crucial part of your Dachshund’s routine.
It keeps your pet healthy, accustoms him to handling by you or
anyone else (your vet most importantly), and alerts you to any
lumps, bumps, bald spots, parasites, or other health problems
before they become too serious.
Puppies don’t need much grooming at first, but starting a grooming
routine on the first day helps train your dog to accept and even
enjoy grooming. Even if you plan to have your longhaired or wire-
haired Dachsie professionally groomed, daily maintenance ses-
sions with you are important for your dog’s health and are great
for stay-acquainted time. See Chapter 16 for more information on
grooming your Dachshund.
Training on the first day
Your pup can learn good habits only through your instruction.
Training is something that shouldn’t wait. Why not begin training
on the very first full day with your new Dachsie? Training should
be fun for both you and your Dachshund. Positive reinforcement —
praising the behavior you want rather than punishing the behavior
you don’t want — is a great way to teach your puppy the rules, and
training sessions that use positive reinforcement are enjoyable for
everyone. Check out the chapters of Part III for info on how to train
your new Dachshund.
Part II: Starting Out on the Right Paw at Home 
120

Remaining calm and patient
Dachshunds are adorable but stubborn little creatures, so cultivat-
ing the virtue of patience is a necessity for any new Dachshund
owner hoping to establish a routine. Just when you think your pup
will never learn, he does. (Or he just decides to give in and do what
you want, probably because he figured out there’s something good
in it for him!)
Being impatient and getting irritated at your new pet doesn’t help
teach him how to behave. It only teaches your Dachshund how to
fear you. If you feel yourself getting irritable, stop a training or
grooming session immediately, or give your Dachshund a break in
his den. If you think you can’t stand to clean up one more accident,
rethink your housetraining techniques. If you can’t stand to clean
up the chewed garbage one more time, move the garbage to a
place where your puppy can’t reach it. A lot of this is common
sense if you step back and look at what’s really going on.
Sure, puppy behavior can be frustrating, but in most cases, the
behavior that really needs changing is yours. Your puppy isn’t get-
ting the message, and you need to reexamine your strategy.
Most importantly, don’t lose your temper and get angry with your
dog. There’s never a good reason to strike a dog. Hitting doesn’t
make sense to dogs; it only makes you appear dangerous and unpre-
dictable. Manage your puppy’s behavior in a way that will help
improve the behavior to your liking. You’re in charge. You can do it.
Calling On a Vet
Many breeders, rescue groups, shelters, and pet stores require a
vet visit within the first day or two to activate the health contract.
Whether or not this is required, a vet visit is a must for other rea-
sons. A vet can do the following on your first visit with your new pet:
 Alert you to potential problems with your dog
 Instruct you on proper care
 Set up a schedule for first-year vaccinations
 Do basic maintenance that might be necessary, like de-worming
and vaccinations
 Give you training tips and advice on behavior modification
Chapter 9: The First Day: What to Do and What to Expect 121

Your vet is an invaluable resource in your dog’s care, so take full
advantage and visit often. And if your Dachshund has been under
the care of another vet before he became yours, get that vet’s con-
tact information so your vet can get up to speed on what your
Dachshund needs and what has already been done for him.
If you haven’t found a good vet yet, ask your local rescue organ-
ization, animal shelter, or even local breeder for a recommenda-
tion to a Dachshund-familiar vet. Also talk to friends, especially
fellow Dachshund owners, who use their vets for regular checkups.
Although you can always vet-hop if you don’t like the one you pick,
your best bet — and the best situation for your pet — is to pick
someone who receives rave reviews from experienced pet owners
and who has a lot of experience with Dachshunds.
When you find a candidate, call ahead and ask for a tour of the vet-
erinary hospital. This helps you determine if the staff is friendly, as
they’ll reflect the attitude of the doctors. A good hospital has noth-
ing to hide and the staff will be proud to show you their hospital
and equipment, and they should also be willing to explain their
procedures and policies to you.
Find out if the hospital is a member of the AAHA (American Animal
Hospital Association). These hospitals have voluntarily opened
themselves up for inspection and must meet rigorous standards

During your tour or initial visit, take the following good-vet check-
list with you to make your evaluation and choice easier. Make sev-
eral copies and fill out one for each vet you visit, if you visit more
than one:
 Was it easy to make an appointment?
❑Yes
❑No
 Was the person on the phone friendly and accommodating?
❑Yes
❑No
 Is the vet’s office easy to get to or too far away?
❑Accessible
❑Inaccessible
 How do the prices compare with other vets in the area?
❑Cheaper
❑On par
❑Expensive!
 Does the reception area look and smell clean? (A doggy smell
is natural, but you shouldn’t smell anything unpleasant.)
❑Yes
❑No

 Is the office staff friendly and polite when you visit?
❑Yes
❑No
 Does your Dachshund seem interested when you visit, or 
does she seem nervous? (This isn’t always a good indicator.
Some dogs act nervous in new places, and your Dachshund
may remember a previous vet’s office where she received a
vaccination shot.)
❑Interested
❑Nervous
 Do you have a good feeling about the vet? Is he friendly, open,
and easy to talk to?
❑Yes
❑No
 Does the vet seem to have a genuine interest and love for 
animals?
❑Yes
❑No
 Does the vet seem to bond with you and your dog?
❑Yes
❑No
 Is the vet ready and willing to answer all your questions?
❑Yes
❑No
 Does the vet make you feel like he has plenty of time for you?
❑Yes
❑No
 Is the vet willing to give you references?
❑Yes
❑No
 Is the vet open and forthcoming about his training?
❑Yes
❑No
 Does the vet have any particular experience with Dachshunds?
❑Yes
❑No
 Do you have a good feeling about the whole experience after
you leave?
❑Yes
❑No
Make some notes on the back of your checklist so that you remem-
ber specific things about each individual vet. It’s easy to forget
details when you’ve visited several. If the answers you give look
favorable on the whole, congratulations — it looks like you’ve
found a great vet for your Dachsie!

Understanding the 
Defiant Dachshund
In This Chapter
 Opening the books on a Dachshund’s intelligence
 Accepting that Dachshunds don’t speak English
 Talking to and understanding the Dachshund
 Relating to your individual Dachshund
You’ve heard it from this book (if you’ve read earlier chapters)
and probably from many other places if you’ve been doing
your Dachsie research: Dachshunds are notoriously stubborn. 
You may also have heard the words defiant, willful, obstinate, head-
strong, and intractable. All true, yes, and appropriate in some
Dachshunds more than in others.
But this trait is perfectly natural for a Dachshund; it’s even part of
her considerable charm. This chapter will help you understand
why Dachshunds act the way they do in order to help you come 
to know and train yours better. So-called stubbornness is really a
sign of Dachshund intelligence — of an independent thinker that’s
far more than an obedient automaton. Ask any Dachshund devotee
about the Dachshund’s stubborn streak, and you’ll probably elicit
a smile. Instead of angering those who love her, the stubborn Dachs-
hund engenders affection, even pride, because the Dachshund’s
obstinate nature is anything but malicious. Your little pup is simply
smart as a whip. (Feel free to brag about her!)

Looking for Signs of 
Intelligent Life
I’ve heard trainers, breeders, and behaviorists describe two types
of intelligence in dogs:
 The kind of intelligence that makes a dog highly and easily
trainable (Border Collies, Shelties, and Labrador Retrievers
are this kind of intelligent, for example)
 The kind of intelligence that manifests itself as the ability to
think without requiring direction from humans
Dachshunds tend to fall into the second category, so don’t be
fooled into thinking your stubborn, seemingly untrainable puppy is
stupid. Au contraire. The problem may just be that your
Dachshund is too smart.
Most dogs want to please the people they love, but not to the point
of severe boredom through senseless repetition or through the
performance of an activity that doesn’t seem to have a point.
Dachshunds revel in fun, but what’s so fun about standing in the
middle of the living room floor, being told to sit, stand, sit, stand,
sit, stand, sit, stand? Keep your training sessions short, frequent,
fun, and challenging. If you’re bored, your Dachshund is probably
bored, too. (For more training tips, head to Chapter 11 and keep
going.)
Dachshunds may not be humans, but they aren’t robots, comput-
ers, or animals that enjoy a life of servitude, either. They have
many wants:
 They want to be with you.
 They want something interesting to do with their time.
 They want to enjoy their food, their sleep, and their playtime.
 They want to learn tricks and do what you ask, as long as it
makes sense to their doggy minds.
So, the first thing to remember when approaching your Dachshund
for your early training sessions is that training must be fun, must
have rewards, and must be something you and your Dachshund do
every day together —something you both anticipate and relish.

Why Dachshunds Are 
Independent Thinkers
Different dog breeds have been bred for different reasons. Some
have been developed to be very in-tune to their humans’ every
need — working in close partnership to herd livestock or retrieve
game, for example. Some have been developed to be strong, pro-
tective working dogs. And some have been developed to curl up
and look pretty on the laps or in the sleeves of royalty.
Dachshunds (like most Hounds) have been developed to think for
themselves (see Figure 10-1 for a Dachsie deep in thought).
Traditionally, the best Dachshunds were the ones that could follow
scents without constant supervision, that could go into badger
dens and corner badgers on their own, and that could bark to alert
their human companions that the prey was cornered. It was man
and Dachshund against badger or rabbit or wild boar.
Figure 10-1: This Dachshund is a free (and deep) thinker.

In other words, Dachshunds — even the Minis — were made to
perform reliably and intelligently without too much human inter-
vention. Therefore, the best way to get through to a Dachshund so
that she can learn your house rules and what you desire from her
is to learn how to speak her language. The following sections dive
deep into this topic.
Dachshunds Can’t Obey What 
They Don’t Understand
If only you could tell your Dachsie, “Listen here, Gertrude. When
you feel the urge to eliminate, please let me know ahead of time
and I’ll let you outside.” Or, “This is the deal, Otto. When I say ‘Sit,’
you plant your rump on the ground and stay there. And when I say
‘Come,’ you run right over here as fast as you can. If you do, I’ll
really like it a lot.”
Sadly, dog training isn’t that easy. But it isn’t too hard, either. The
first thing you have to realize is that your Dachshund doesn’t
speak English. Okay, sure, you know that. But have you really con-
sidered what it means? It means that your Dachshund isn’t being
defiant the first time you say “Sit” and she just stares at you with a
look that says, “What planet are you from?” She just doesn’t know
what you’re talking about. Her mother didn’t tell her to Sit. How is
she supposed to understand?
And, even if your Dachshund has learned “Come” in the living
room, she may not understand that when she smells a juicy squir-
rel dashing through the park and runs madly after it and you shriek
“Come!” hysterically that you expect the same response as you did
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
130
Field trials: Independent thinking in action
Watching a Dachshund field trial is a great way to observe the Dachshund’s inde-
pendent nature in action. In Dachshund field trials, Dachshunds compete in pairs to
follow the scent of a rabbit. (The rabbit isn’t caught or killed; usually, it isn’t even
seen by the dogs.) When the dogs catch the scent, or line, of the rabbit, the handlers
aren’t allowed to intervene in any way to direct the Dachshunds. The dogs must trail
the scent all on their own, followed by the watchful judges who determine which
Dachshunds are most capable of following the trail. See Chapter 15 for more on
these field trials.

in the living room. (And no matter how much you practice, your
Dachshund may still chase that squirrel, so keep her leash on 
outside!)
Teaching your Dachshund what behavior you expect when you say
certain words takes work and plenty of consistent practice. It also
takes a certain degree of showing before the telling alone will work.
Never hold a grudge against your Dachshund. After a few seconds,
your dog will have no idea what you’re angry about. Dogs live in
the present, and they only know that you’re angry. If you decide to
punish your pup for chewing your shoe by keeping her locked up
for two hours or by ignoring her all day, your punishment will be
ineffective and even destructive, because your Dachshund will
learn to fear you or avoid you rather than listen to you.
Communicating with 
Your Dachshund
How do you talk Dachshund? First, you have to see the world from
your Dachshund’s point of view. Imagine that you’re a Dachshund,
scampering around about 8 inches off the ground. You’ve suddenly
been uprooted from the home you knew, and here you are in a
strange place with a strange creature who towers above you and
keeps uttering strange, undecipherable sounds. The creature
seems very nice, offering food and petting you. The voice sounds
well-intentioned, and sometimes you get treats.
But sometimes the voice gets mad, irritated, and scary. Sometimes
the creature appears dangerous, waving his or her arms wildly and
yelling. Sometimes the yelling seems to be at you, but you can’t
imagine why. You want to do whatever will make the creature talk
nicely, and you sure want some more of those treats. If only you
knew what to do to elicit that behavior from your creature!
Oh well, you may as well go on exploring your new environment,
relieving yourself when you have to and chewing on whatever you
find that looks tempting. After all, this is what dogs do; you don’t
have any other instructions — at least none you can understand.
To get through to this uneducated and independent-minded little
Dachshund, you have to be very specific in your rewards. The
moment she does something good, praise her, pet her, even give
her the occasional treat. When she’s naughty, redirect her to the
right activity (hand her a chew toy, move her to her outdoor 
Chapter 10: Understanding the Defiant Dachshund 131

bathroom, and so on) without making any fuss. Ignore her until she
does the right thing again and then heap on the praise. Now she’ll
get the message.
Don’t just praise your dog when she does something you ask her
to. Also praise her when she does something well or right when
you didn’t ask. Constant positive reinforcement of good behavior is
integral to developing a good relationship with your Dachshund. If
you spend the whole day yelling “No!” and “Bad dog!” but never
rewarding your Dachshund for the things she does right, she won’t
learn the self-confidence that’s so important to a well-trained and
happy pet. And she certainly won’t learn what you want her to.
The following sections present more communication tips that will
have you speaking Dachsie in no time. For more on the words you
can teach your Dachshund, head to Chapter 14.
Accentuating the positive
Most people use a combination of training methods for their dogs,
depending on the situation. Here are the most common methods of
training:
 Positive reinforcement rewards desired behavior with some-
thing the dog wants, such as a treat or praise.
 Negative reinforcement rewards desired behavior by remov-
ing an unpleasant condition — like when you release a choke
chain after your dog sits.
 Punishment discourages undesired behavior by inflicting
something undesirable, such as a scolding.
 Extinction doesn’t reinforce undesired behavior — like when
you ignore your Dachshund when she jumps up on you.
Positive reinforcement used in conjunction with extinction is consid-
ered by many contemporary trainers to be the most effective, fast,
and humane method of dog training. When your Dachshund does
something you want her to do, reward her immediately and heap on
the praise. When she does something she isn’t supposed to do,
don’t reinforce the behavior. Completely ignore her. She’ll hate that.
Of course, if she’s doing something dangerous or damaging, you
have to stop her immediately. Whisk her outside before she elimi-
nates on your carpet or remove her jaws from your table leg.
Accompany your removal with a firm “No!” But don’t make a big
deal about it. She won’t understand, she’ll get scared, and even if
she does learn not to chew the table in your presence (because
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
132

that’s the only time she gets punished for it), she won’t understand
that she shouldn’t ever chew on the table.
One of the most important things to remember when commu-
nicating with your Dachshund is consistency. If you praise your
Dachshund for obeying your command one day and then ignore
her for obeying your command the next day, she won’t get it. If you
refuse to let her on your bed one day and then let her on your bed
the next day, she won’t get that, either. Make the rules and stick to
them. If you must change them, keep them changed. Dachshunds
don’t understand waffling.
Staying calm and upbeat
If you want to relate to your Dachshund, the most important thing
you can do is stay positive. Getting angry when your Dachshund
eats your loveseat or leaves a puddle on your antique quilt is
understandable, but it won’t do any good. Leave the room, get
angry, get over it, come back, and resolve not to let it happen
again, because (and you may not want to hear this) the whole
thing was your fault anyway.
Dachshunds aren’t malicious. They don’t hold grudges. Your
Dachshund isn’t trying to wreck your stuff or disobey you. When
she does something wrong (wrong according to your rules), 
it’s only because she didn’t understand that the behavior is 
unacceptable.
If you’re always (or at least usually) calm, positive, upbeat, and
happy when teaching your Dachshund the rules, as well as the 
fun things you and she can do together, she’ll get your meaning
much more quickly. Dachshunds are all about reward. What can
they do to get one, and what can they do to get another one? It’s
that simple. Yelling isn’t a reward. A slap on the rump isn’t a
reward. Rubbing her nose in an accident is most certainly not a
reward. But a treat? A pat? A walk? An enthusiastic “What a good,
sweet, darling little puppy dog you are!”? Now those are rewards
that allow you to relate to a Dachshund.
Showing, telling, and reinforcing
Words make sense to a Dachshund only when they’re linked with
something you’ve first shown her how to do. For example, you can
follow this three-step process:
1. Taking your Dachshund to her elimination station every
hour or so the first day you have her is showing her.
Chapter 10: Understanding the Defiant Dachshund 133

2. Associating this action with a word or phrase, such as “Go
potty,” is how showing leads to telling.
3. Praising her and/or offering her a bit of kibble when she
does her duty is positive reinforcement.
Together, these actions result in a Dachshund that knows what you
want and is glad to give it to you.
The most effective method, in my opinion, for showing, telling, and
reinforcing what’s expected of your Dachshund is lure-and-reward
training. You use a lure, such as a piece of kibble or a treat, to guide
your Dachshund into the desired position as you tell her the name
of the position — Sit, Lie Down, Bow, or whatever. When she
achieves the position, Dachsie gets the treat. Show, tell, and rein-
force. Now that isn’t a difficult communication.
Recognizing “Normal” 
Dachshund Behavior
Despite all the generalizations you hear about dogs and Dachshunds,
the fact is, every Dachshund is different. Some are more stubborn
than others. And some are jollier or bigger performers, or more
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
134
Rewarding your good dog with new treats
Tired of the same old pieces of kibble for positive reinforcements? You can use many
things to reward your Dachshund. Here are some ideas:
 Small pieces of lean meat, veggies, berries, a spoonful of plain yogurt or olive
oil with dinner, pieces of whole-grain cereal (oat rings or wheat biscuits, for
example), or bits of scrambled eggs will keep your Dachshund excited about
training.
 A game of fetch or a run around the yard will energize your pup.
 An extra grooming session now and then will be appreciated (most Dachshunds
love to be brushed).
 A walk with you is the ultimate reward for a job well done.
Some trainers don’t believe in using food rewards, but Dachshunds are highly food-
motivated, so as long as your rewards don’t cause your Dachshund to become over-
weight, using food rewards is a great way to train.

retiring, or less likely to enjoy children, or more friendly toward
strangers, and so on.
You can read every book on the planet about Dachshunds, dog
behavior, and training, but until you get to know the personality of
your Dachshund, you’ll have only half the story. Putting any indi-
vidual Dachshund in any individual home will result in a unique
and special situation. The following sections give you some
common Dachshund desires and behaviors and then explain how
differences can occur.
A common Dachshund mentality
Most Dachshunds aren’t complicated. (And neither are most
people, really.) They share many characteristics, which I list here:
 They enjoy pleasurable activities. They require food, water,
sleep, and affection. They absolutely love to go on walks, play
outdoors, chase squirrels, chase balls (but not necessarily
give them back to you), sleep under the bedcovers with you,
and curl up on your lap to watch television. They’ll do just
about anything for your undivided attention.
 They don’t enjoy being hungry, in pain, overly tired, uncom-
fortable, or frightened, and they absolutely hate it when you’re
displeased with them — especially if they don’t know why.
They don’t want to be ignored. They want to be the center of
your universe, and they sincerely believe they deserve to be.
 They don’t know what “Sit” means until you show them. But
they’re smart, so after you show them, they’ll understand.
They don’t know why you want them to do boring, repetitive
things when they could be sniffing around or having lunch.
But they’ll do those things if the reward is big enough. They
want to know why they shouldn’t pull on the leash. So if you
make it clear that pulling on the leash means no walk and that
trotting politely by your side means a long walk, they’ll be
happy to oblige.
And that’s about it. If only raising kids was that easy! (Actually,
positive reinforcement works on kids, too, but that’s a different
book.) All you have to do is practice, practice, practice. Keep train-
ing fun, keep it happy, and keep it rewarding for everyone involved.
Nature versus nurture
Your Dachshund inherited certain traits and tendencies from her
parents. She may be particularly smart or quick or laid-back. But
Chapter 10: Understanding the Defiant Dachshund 135

nurture plays a big part, as well. Everything you do, everything you
say, and the way you and your Dachshund live together shape her
personality. Nurture affects her ability to learn, her desire to please
you, and even her zest for life. Talk about a big responsibility!
However, even if you do everything the way you think (and I say)
you should, your Dachshund may be particularly stubborn and
hard, requiring sharper corrections (though never physical ones).
Perhaps you have a sensitive fellow that practically faints with joy
if you smile in his direction. You’ll probably never need to raise
your voice even slightly with this one, and you may never even
need to use food as a positive reinforcement for training.
Maybe yours doesn’t want to sleep in your bed at all. Maybe she
already knows what you mean when you say “Come,” and you
hardly have to train her.
Maybe she pushes your limits to see how much she can get away
with, even when she knows exactly what you want — just out of
curiosity or tenacity or because she’s particularly precocious.
All you can do is live and learn together, stay positive, and give
yourself a timeout when you get angry (and you’ll probably get
angry from time to time). Keep at it. You and your Dachshund have
a bond of mutual love, respect, and affection, even if you may not
always like each other.
Some dogs seem to be completely untrainable. Well into the first
year, though, their owners suddenly discover that these dogs are
deaf — an affliction that happens sometimes with Dachshunds,
most often in dogs with large areas of white. There are alternate
methods for training deaf Dachshunds, which you can learn from a
professional trainer with experience in this area. The following sec-
tion digs deeper into the topic of health problems.
When training problems 
mean health problems
In some cases, training problems or certain unusual behaviors may
indicate a health problem in your Dachsie. Apart from individual
differences your dog shows, be on the lookout for any of the fol-
lowing behaviors and alert your veterinarian. Better to catch a
health problem in the early stages than to ignore it until it
becomes life-threatening.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
136

Call your vet if your Dachshund
 Never obeys your commands when she can’t see your face.
 Was housetrained but suddenly begins to have accidents
inside the house regularly.
 Behaves aggressively for no good reason, especially if you’ve
trained your Dachshund not to bite or if she has never exhib-
ited aggressive behavior before.
 Suddenly becomes shy around people when she wasn’t 
previously.
 Suddenly seems forgetful or confused, possibly bumping into
furniture (more common in older dogs).
 Suddenly refuses to come, go on a walk, or move at all.
 Yelps when touched.
 Suddenly becomes destructive, fearful, or hysterical when left
alone.
All these behaviors may seem to be training issues, but they could
be signs of a serious health problem — possibly of an acute nature.
Don’t hesitate to call your vet. She’s there to answer your ques-
tions and keep your Dachshund well.
The behaviorist is your ally
If your dog exhibits behavioral problems, seems untrainable
despite your best efforts, or has any of the problems listed in the
preceding section and your vet has ruled out a medical problem,
consider contacting an animal behaviorist. No, it isn’t like taking
your pet in for psychotherapy. Dogs can suffer from very real and
serious behavioral problems, and a behaviorist is trained to deal
with these specific problems.
Don’t be shy about calling a behaviorist. Plenty of people do, and
plenty of people are very glad they did. Many dogs have been
saved through simple behavior-modification techniques. Most
dogs surrendered to animal shelters are there because of behav-
ioral problems their owners couldn’t or wouldn’t handle. Don’t let
your Dachshund suffer this fate. Learn her language, train her, hire
a professional when necessary, and immerse your dog in plenty of
love. Now you’re talking Dachshund.
Chapter 10: Understanding the Defiant Dachshund 137

An animal behaviorist may not have all the answers, but a good
one may know just what to do when you’ve exhausted other
avenues. Sometimes the most serious-seeming problem is really a
simple matter.
Some dog trainers also call themselves canine behavioral consult-
ants. These trainers may not have advanced degrees in animal
behavior like a behaviorist, but they may have a lot of practical
experience with behavior problems. A consultant could be a big
help when you’re trying to solve a training problem, depending on
your situation, but behaviorists generally have more formal educa-
tion. Only behaviorists can prescribe medication, such as a medi-
cine that may be appropriate for separation anxiety or aggression.

Chapter 11
Taking Charge of 
Your Dachsie
In This Chapter
 Understanding your Dachshund’s inborn tendencies
 Recognizing natural Dachsie skills
 Discovering the power of Dachshund wiles
S
ometimes, despite your best efforts, you’ll wonder who’s train-
ing whom when you get to the end of a long day of Dachshund
disobedience. Training a Dachshund is indeed a challenge, and it
helps to keep reminding yourself who’s the boss — as well as how
to be the boss. Nobody ever said training a Dachshund was easy —
but it certainly isn’t impossible.
Your Dachshund won’t mind being the boss, but he’d really prefer
that you do the job — and believe me, your life will be a lot easier if
you do. You don’t want to spend your days subject to the capricious
nature of this tiny tyrant. You must take charge, and this chapter
shows you the reasons.
Knowing Your Dachshund’s
Instincts and Traits
The first step toward taking the reins in the dog-human relationship
is to know your Dachshund. All Dachshunds have unique qualities
and instincts. Knowing them and taking advantage of the character-
istics of the breed will help you take and maintain control. (Chapters
1–3 also give you info so you can get familiar with the Dachshund.)

Each Dachsie persona in this section is probably a part of your
Dachshund’s overall personality. Some traits may sound more like
your pet than others. Whichever types seem dominant in your dog,
use those tendencies in your training and play sessions.
This is one of the advantages of owning a purebred dog. Although
each Dachshund is different in some ways, they’re all basically the
same. Each characteristic in this section carries with it certain train-
ing challenges. (There are also certain games each Dachshund type
enjoys, as well as certain organized competitive dog sports, if you
want to pursue those things. Head to Chapter 15 for more.)
The hunter/tracker
Dachshunds were bred to hunt, to track scents, and to follow their
quarry — with unwavering persistence and courage beyond their
size — until the prize is won. What does this mean for your training?
 Training challenge: If your Dachshund detects a scent 
while you’re working, training, playing, or walking together, 
it will take every ounce of doggie willpower for him not to
dash off after it. Most of the time, he won’t be able to resist.
Your Dachshund is very likely to run away from you if you
don’t keep him on his leash in an open area. It isn’t that he
doesn’t like you. He’s just a hunter and tracker by nature, 
and you can’t easily train out instinct.
 Great games: Dachshunds almost always enjoy games that
mimic a hunting or tracking situation. Show your Dachsie 
a small ball, let him sniff it, and then throw it as far as you 
can (in a safe area). Watch him do his stuff. The tricky part 
is convincing him to give it back to you, but after he learns
that returning the ball to you means another go-around, he’ll 
probably be more than willing (in his own sweet time, that is).
 An edge on the competition: You can use your Dachshund’s
tracking ability for advanced training in competitive tracking,
field trials, and earth dog or den trials. These organized sports
really take advantage of the Dachshund’s natural abilities, 
and Dachshunds love to have challenging work to do. Seeing 
a Dachshund in action, using his natural instincts, is truly
inspiring. (For more on training your Dachshund for competi-
tion and getting involved in competitive dog sports, see
Chapter 15.)
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron)

The digger
If you have a Dachshund and your backyard fence isn’t buried 
at least a foot underground, you probably know all about the
Dachshund’s penchant for digging. Some Dachshunds dig more
than others, but in general, they all love it — after they discover
how fun it is. What does this mean for your training?
 Training challenge: Your Dachshund can behave in the 
most maddening ways: digging under your fence and running
off, digging up your flower beds and vegetable gardens, and
even attempting to dig through your carpeting and furniture.
However, you have no excuse not to prepare. You can line the
bottom of your fence with bricks or rocks or even pour a foun-
dation under the fence. Grow your garden somewhere else or
put a fence around it (dig a foot-deep trench and sink the fence
into it). Sound like a lot of work? Sure, but it’s all part of life
with a Dachshund.
If your Dachshund insists on digging in a specific area on your
carpet or furniture, break out the Bitter Apple or another chew-
deterrent spray and take action (consult your vet and follow
the package directions). Be vigilant and prevent destructive
digging before it gets too destructive. And don’t get mad if your
Dachshund digs. You can’t argue with instinct, and he isn’t
doing it to make you mad. He just thinks it’s really, really fun.
You can relate to that, can’t you?
If your Dachshund loves to dig but you can’t afford to pour a
foundation under your fence, all is not lost. Line the base of
your fence with cinderblocks to make digging more of a chal-
lenge, and then create a diversion. Build a sandbox in your yard
as your Dachsie’s very own digging playground, and train him
to dig there by moving him to the box whenever he’s in digging
mode. Praise any digging attempts he makes in the box. You
can even bury dog treats in the sand, just to inspire him. In
extreme cases, your Dachshund may not be able to go in the
backyard unsupervised, but a little extra vigilance is a small
price to pay to keep your Dachshund safe.
 Great games: If you decide to build a sandbox just for Dachsie
digging, you can play a game to help train him to use it. Show
your Dachshund a toy. Let him sniff it and get him excited
about it. Then go outside with him, bury the toy in the sand-
box while he watches, and cover it up. Now ask your
Dachshund to “find the toy!” Fun for all.
Chapter 11: Taking Charge of Your Dachsie 141

 An edge on the competition: Dachshunds are born for den and
earth dog trials. If your Dachshund really likes to burrow under
things (and what Dachshund doesn’t?), you probably have 
a natural. Earth dog and den trials don’t take much training.
They’re events that utilize a dog’s natural instinct and aren’t 
for exhibiting special skills developed by training (although the
bury-the-toy-in-the-sandbox game probably will help to hone
your Dachshund’s natural instinct).
The athlete
Dachshunds may have delicate backs and may not appear particu-
larly buff, but many are superior athletes (see Figure 11-1 for an
example). Dachshunds are built to work, not to sit around looking
pretty. Even Minis are designed to follow quarry into small dens. No
lap dogs in Dachshund land (although they do love your lap). What
does the Dachshund’s natural athletic ability mean to your training?
Figure 11-1: This Dachsie looks like a natural athlete, no?
 Training challenge: Dachshunds like to move, exercise, 
and use their natural athletic ability, so if you’re a sedentary
person, you’ll have to work to make sure that your Dachshund
gets enough exercise. A Dachshund that doesn’t get enough
exercise is almost certain to cause trouble; he’s got to get 
out all that energy somehow.
This natural athlete is game for training; he’ll love active ses-
sions with practice disguised as doggy sports. He’ll also think
you’re really fun to hang around with.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
142

Athletic as they are, Dachshunds probably shouldn’t engage
in certain activities too often. If a sport or activity involves
running around sharp corners at high speed, shaking the neck
(like in a boisterous game of tug of war), jumping down from
high places, or racing up and down steep stairs, discourage
your Dachshund from getting too rowdy. You want to keep 
his back in good shape.
 Great games: Dachshunds love to play. They’re excellent run-
ners, and some really enjoy jumping up to catch a ball (or grab
your dinner off that low counter). Let your Dachshund refine
his natural athletic abilities by playing active games. Throw a
Frisbee and let him chase it. Set up an obstacle course and let
him maneuver through it to find a favorite toy, ball, or food
treat. And don’t forget the all-important walk (see Chapter 14
for training tips). Your Dachshund loves to be on the move, and
when your daily exercise is over, he’ll be more than happy to
relax, kick back, and allow you to pet him to sleep.
 An edge on the competition: Don’t be fooled into thinking 
that your Dachshund can’t compete in athletic activities, such
as obedience and agility competitions, and in areas of competi-
tion reserved for Dachshunds, such as field and den trials.
Dachshunds have achieved the highest obedience titles, which
takes tremendous athletic ability. And although Dachshunds
aren’t typically thought of as the most agile breed, they can 
and do participate in agility competition as well — if jumps are
adjusted for height. Your local dog club may have other events
your Dachshund can participate in. If you think organized ath-
letics would be fun, and your Dachshund enjoys that kind of
thing, go for it.
The actor within
Your Dachsie is a real clown and is happiest when all eyes are 
on him. You may wonder whether anyone will pay attention to you
again, because since you brought home your Dachshund, he’s been
the star of the household, and he likes it that way, thank you very
much. You may even be tempted to call your little Dachshund 
a diva. What does this mean for your training?
 Training challenge: If you don’t make training sessions 
fun, and if they aren’t all about your Dachshund, forget it.
What does a born performer want with tedium? With sharing
the spotlight? Nothing. Take advantage of your Dachshund’s
showy side and make a big deal out of good behavior. The best
way to discourage bad behavior is to completely ignore it. Your
performer wants to be center stage and hates being ignored
even more than being yelled at, so take advantage of this trait.
Chapter 11: Taking Charge of Your Dachsie 143

 Great games: If it pleases your little performer (and it probably
will), teach him some really flashy tricks that are sure to elicit
oohs, aahs, giggles, and applause from spectators. Tricks are
sure to become a favorite part of your scene-stealing Dachsie’s
repertoire. Chapter 14 has all the details.
 An edge on the competition: Consider looking into a fun 
competitive activity called canine freestyle or canine musical
freestyle. This competition involves a choreographed routine
that includes both you and your Dachshund. Any dog can
compete, but Dachshunds love to show off; if yours is good 
at obedience but you both like the idea of something flashier,
freestyle may be right up your alley. Even if you’re a little shy,
your Dachshund can do most of the fancy footwork. For more
on canine freestyle events, see Chapter 15.
Oh, Those Dachshund Wiles . . .
If you get a Dachshund, you’re dealing with a hunter, a tracker, a
digger, an athlete, and an actor destined for whatever stage you’ll
give him. The combination results in a unique set of what I like to
call “Dachshund wiles.”
Dachshund wiles are hard to define, yet exceedingly powerful.
They make up the force that mysteriously compels you to hand
over half of your hot dog to your devious little darling, even when
you’re still hungry. They keep you from answering the phone when
your Dachshund is curled on your lap. They keep you from staying
angry at your Dachshund for more than five seconds. And they
somehow propel you, each and every night, to the very edge of
your bed, reserving most of the space on your king-sized mattress
for your 8-pound Miniature Dachshund.
A force to be reckoned with, indeed. And certainly a force to con-
sider when training your Dachshund. What can you do in the face
of such power? If you learn how your Dachshund uses his wiles,
you’ll learn how to put some of your own wiles into play.
How Dachsies manipulate
Dogs need certain things, like food, shelter, warmth, and companion-
ship. They also desire certain things, like more food, more warmth,
and a whole lotta companionship. Dogs don’t like other things, like
hunger, standing out in the rain, or being ignored. They’re social
animals, domesticated to enjoy the good life — and oh, how they
love suppertime.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
144

It only makes sense, then, that your Dachshund will do whatever he
can to get more of what he wants and less of what he doesn’t want.
Any creature does this (even you). Some are simply more effective 
in their techniques than others. Your Dachshund will soon learn —
all on his own — what behaviors encourage you to hand over the
goods (treats, kind words, snuggles) and what behaviors cause you
to go off the deep end or purposefully ignore him.
Are you a pushover? Your Dachshund will soon discover whether 
a cute expression accompanied by a slightly cocked head will melt
your heart and cause you to toss another gourmet dog cookie in
his direction. If you’re not careful, he’ll come to learn that barking,
nipping, whining, or jumping results in treats and attention. (To a
Dachshund, even negative attention like yelling is better than being
ignored.)
Always remember to reward the good behavior, not the bad. In
other words, turn the tables on your clever little pet. If he recog-
nizes that begging only gets him ignored, but that lying quietly in
the corner during dinner leads to you serving her dinner, then con-
gratulations. You have the upper hand. When you make him realize
that bad behavior results in nothing, and that good behavior — a
well-behaved greeting when you arrive home, with an eager wag-
ging tail but no jumping, for example — gets him plenty of praise,
stroking, and kisses, you’ll be manipulating him in the best way.
After your Dachshund is well-trained, you’ll be able to bend the
rules now and then. However, if you make it a habit to enforce rules
only when you have the energy, you may as well forget the rules
altogether. Your Dachshund won’t understand inconsistent enforce-
ment. He won’t know how you’ll react when he does something, so
he won’t even try to anticipate. He’ll just do what he wants to do.
Why you must be in charge
If you don’t decide from day one to be in charge of your Dachshund’s
behavior, he’ll take you for a ride. You’ll be a slave to his whims, 
his bad habits, and his begging, barking, chewing, housebreaking
mishaps, and other behaviors that you never dreamed you’d have 
to endure. Remember back in those days when you used to say,
“When I have a dog, he’ll never do that”?
Raising a Dachshund is hard work. It takes vigilance, consistency,
and a refusal on your part to give in. Of course, being consistent and
firm, and steeling against those Dachshund wiles, is easier for some
than for others. You’ll be a step ahead of the game if you first figure
Chapter 11: Taking Charge of Your Dachsie 145

out your personal training style, including your strengths and —
more importantly — your weaknesses. Check out Chapter 12 to
determine your personal training profile, and remember: Stay
strong. Be consistent. You are in charge!

Determining Your 
Trainer Profile

E
very person has a unique nature and personality; attempting to
practice any daily behavior that goes against your personality
is probably futile. If you’re crazy about chocolate, a diet of tofu and
bean sprouts probably won’t last for more than a day or two (just
ask me — I know). You have to find a lifestyle that makes sense for
your personal tastes and level of willpower.
Same thing with dog training. If you’re a big sap, and one look at
that cute little puppy is enough to drop you to your knees, a strict,
regimented, authoritarian training style won’t work for you. You’ll
probably end up with a Dachshund in your bed, and you’ll proba-
bly spend plenty of money on fancy treats and expensive sweaters,
feeling guilty all the while that you’re doing something wrong. But
you’re not! You need to train according to your personal style.
Perhaps you love dogs and they’re a big part of your life, but you
feel that consistency and good behavior are paramount. You have
no trouble making a set of rules and enforcing them. The dog is the
dog and you are the master; your Dachshund can whine or bat her
big, dark eyes at you all day, but you know that extra treats will
make her chubby, and you have no intention of letting her jump on
visitors or beg at the table. (You probably also have very well-
behaved children — or you would.)

Part of the challenge of training a dog — especially a Dachshund —
is recognizing that your personality and training style will impact
your training effectiveness — and your Dachshund’s personality.
This chapter helps you determine your individual training style
and develop a training strategy that’s tailored to your strengths and
weaknesses. You want to help your Dachshund, in your own per-
sonal way, to be the best Dachshund she can be. (For info on apply-
ing your style to Dachshund training, head to Chapters 13 and 14.)
Forming Your Personal 
Training Style
An analysis of your relationship with your Dachshund isn’t complete
without a little self-examination. For some people, training dogs is
easy (perhaps for the owner of the star of Figure 12-1). Others can’t
seem to train the most willing and tractable of pets. What is it about
human behavior that’s sometimes so contrary to communicating
effectively with animal behavior?

Different people have different training styles. Play-based training
or short drills, food rewards or praises and pats, learning tricks or
unlearning bad habits — all are effective and possible as long as the
training is consistent, loving, practiced daily, based on positive rein-
forcement rather than punishment, and fun for both you and your
Dachshund. The following sections allow you to determine your
training profile and form a training plan that will be effective and
long-lasting.
Determining your training profile
You can be better prepared to train your Dachshund if you can 
identify your personal tendencies beforehand. Answer the following
questions to determine your trainer profile. If some of the questions
aren’t relevant yet (for example, if you haven’t brought your new
puppy home yet), imagine how you think you’d react in the situa-
tion and then pick the answer that most closely matches your 
inclinations. Afterward, head to the following section to put your
answers to use:
1. You just brought your new Dachshund puppy home with
you, and you’re introducing her to her new Dachshund
den (see Chapter 9). She doesn’t want to go inside. What
do you do?
A. Throw in some treats, push her inside gently but
firmly, and shut the door. She’ll get used to it.
B. Throw in some treats, offer some encouraging words,
and then ignore her. If you aren’t interesting to play
with, the treats will seem more attractive and she’ll
go inside eventually.
C. Think to yourself, “The crate looks so cold and uninvit-
ing. I can’t possibly leave her in there all alone . . . that
would be so mean.”
2. You and your family are just sitting down to a nice family
dinner. Where is your Dachshund?
A. In her crate. She won’t even get a chance to learn how
to beg in your house!
B. Lying quietly nearby, on the kitchen floor. You’re
determined not to reinforce her begging by giving her
table food, but you hate to have her miss out on the
family dinnertime, because she is part of the family.
Chapter 12: Determining Your Trainer Profile 149

C. Under the table with her front paws on your lap, or
staring winsomely at you and watching your fork with
an eagle eye. She knows where to get the goods. Hey,
is it really fair that you get to eat this good food and
she has to be denied?
3. You give your Dachshund treats
A. During training when she fulfills a request.
B. To reinforce any good behavior.
C. Probably too often, but when she looks at the dog
cookie jar with such longing, you can’t resist. You
want to make her happy.
4. Housebreaking has been
A. A breeze. You crate-trained your Dachshund, and 
she learned the ropes in a week. She never had an
accident inside.
B. Fairly successful. You’re still working on it, but she’s
getting the picture because you take her outside at
the same times every single day. She still makes the
occasional mistake, but you clean it up right away.
C. Um . . . To be honest, you just aren’t comfortable 
with the crate because she whines so pitifully in there,
and you can’t seem to remember to take her out on 
a schedule. But that’s okay, because you don’t mind
cleaning up the messes all that much.
5. Your training sessions are (or will be)
A. Strictly regimented. You hold them at the same time
each day, and you have a planned schedule of what
you’ll cover in each session.
B. Daily, but they’re pretty informal and fun.
C. Wait a minute . . . training? Isn’t that sort of 
authoritarian? But come to think of it, you do ask 
your Dachshund to sit or stay or do whatever seems
fun at the moment.
6. Your goals for your Dachshund are
A. To train her for competition — either in obedience,
agility, field trials, or wherever her talents are (see
Chapter 15).
B. To have a well-behaved family pet that knows and 
follows the house rules most of the time.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
150

C. To have a buddy and best friend. You aren’t too 
concerned about whether she can do tricks. You 
just want her around for cuddling.
7. Your vet tells you your Dachshund is overweight. What
do you do?
A. Immediately restrict her food intake and increase 
the length of her walks.
B. Cut back on the treats and begin measuring her kibble
so that you don’t overestimate. You also become more
careful about walking her every day rather than 
skipping the walks when you don’t feel like it.
C. Buy lower-calorie treats and try to cut back on her
food. But, when she acts like she’s starving, you often
give in and give her just a little bit more. After all, most
people carry a few extra pounds, too. What harm
could it do?
8. Your Dachshund barks at everything — passersby on the
street, trash blowing in the wind, and even at you when
she wants something. How do you handle it?
A. You completely ignore her when she barks or put her
in her den when she gets too loud — especially if she’s
outside disturbing the neighbors. No one should have
to listen to such excessive noise.
B. Recognize that Dachshunds bark but that excessive
barking isn’t tolerable. You keep the blinds shut on
the front windows and ignore her when she barks at
you. You make her come inside if she barks in the
yard. Otherwise, you pay attention because she may
be alerting you to something.
C. You think to yourself, “Dachshunds bark. What about
it?” You don’t mind so much. Besides, if your friends
don’t like it, maybe they really aren’t your friends at all!
9. In your home, nighttime consists of
A. Peace and quiet, with your Dachshund curled up 
in her den, sleeping through the night (after the first
few weeks).
B. An occasional trip outside, but mostly your
Dachshund sleeps nicely under the covers with you.
C. Broken sleep. Every time your Dachshund makes a
noise, you wake up and take her out or give her a toy
to chew. You’ve even found yourself playing with her
at 3 a.m. because she wants to play. You aren’t getting
Chapter 12: Determining Your Trainer Profile 151

much sleep, but you feel like your Dachshund needs
the attention. You only hope she’ll grow out of this
stage and sleep through the night so you can, too.
10. During the day when you’re at work
A. Your Dachshund stays in her den or in an enclosed,
pet-proofed area (see Chapter 6). You either come
home for lunch to let her out or hire a pet sitter or
dog walker to cover the lunch hour.
B. Your Dachshund stays in the kitchen with a baby gate
that keeps her out of the carpeted areas. Sometimes
she chews things, but you’re working on that bad
habit. You come home for lunch as often as you can.
When you don’t, you usually have a mess to clean up.
C. Your Dachshund gets free reign of the house. You feel
so guilty for leaving her that you think she deserves
to shred the trash and have a few accidents. You can’t
blame her.
Letting your Dachshund puppy run free in the house when you’re
away from home can result in more than just property damage. Your
Dachshund can be seriously injured or poisoned if she ingests certain
types of trash or other foreign objects or substances. Dachshund-
proof any room in which your pup will be left unsupervised for any
length of time. Better yet, let her snooze in her den when you’re away.
Developing a personalized 
training plan
After you answer the questions in the preceding section, you can
check out where you stand to develop a personalized training plan.
Tally your answers to determine whether you have mostly As, Bs,
or Cs, and then read the applicable training-strategy discussion
that follows. If you have an equal number of any two letters (or
close to it), read both training-strategy discussions.
If you answer mostly As
You are (or will be) a highly disciplined, efficient, and consistent 
pet owner. You’ve probably always been a schedule person, and you
encourage discipline and respectful behavior in everyone around
you — spouse, children, and pets. For you, a dog is simply another
family member that you expect to follow the rules and behave in an
acceptable manner. If anyone can bring out the best in a Dachshund,
it’s you. Dachshunds crave consistency and want to know the rules.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
152

Take advantage of your tendencies by keeping your Dachshund on
a strict schedule, a healthy diet, and regimented training sessions.
Systematic training is great, because you get a lot accomplished in
the minimum amount of time.
Consider training your Dachshund for professional competition, if
your dog has what it takes (see Chapters 2 and 15). You certainly do.
Your one challenge? Remembering to be fun. Consistency and sched-
ules can get tedious if you don’t maintain your sense of humor when
others aren’t quite as disciplined as you are. When your Dachshund
slips up, gently nudge her back on track. Don’t get angry or irritable
when she doesn’t measure up to your high standards. Instead, keep
working with her (see Chapter 14 for troubleshooting tips). She’ll get
it, and if she can trust you to be kind and loving in your firmness,
she’ll do anything for you.
If you answer mostly Bs
You’re the kind of dog owner most breeders are looking for. You
know what your pet needs, and you do your best to give it to her.
Sometimes you get busy, get off schedule, and bend the rules. You
are human, after all. In general, though, you’re a responsible and
loving Dachshund companion who tries hard to teach your pet
what it means to behave and have a fulfilling family life.
Your training sessions should be fun and full of play, which
Dachshunds love. Your pet will respond quickly to your requests
after she learns what you want.
Your biggest challenge? Keeping a schedule and remembering to
train every day. Dogs thrive on consistency and regularity even
more than humans do, so a routine is important for your dog —
even if you can’t always follow it. You’ll do a great job, however;
your Dachshund is lucky to have a pet owner as caring and 
responsible as you are!
If you answer mostly Cs
You’re probably fully aware that you’re not in charge of your
Dachshund. She’s in charge of you. You need to prepare for a 
life of servitude or change your ways. Don’t be offended. I used 
to be in this category, and I know change is possible. Difficult, yes,
but you don’t have to alter your personality. For the sake of your
Dachshund, you just have to summon up some inner strength and
take charge. Sure, she’s sweet. Sure, she’s charming. Sure, she’s just
about the cutest little thing you’ve ever seen, and you love her to
death. All the more reason to do what’s best for her, which means
not letting her run the show.
Chapter 12: Determining Your Trainer Profile 153

Dogs (like children) will challenge you at every turn, but they want
nothing more than to know, without a doubt, what the rules are.
They also want to know what to expect on a daily basis. Even if you
can’t manage a consistent and regular schedule for yourself (I can’t,
either), you can make a list of things you do each and every day for
and with your Dachshund (see Chapter 9):
 Three meals (measure that kibble, please, or you’ll 
overestimate)
 One grooming session
 One or two walks
 Two or three short training sessions
Do these things not happen at the same time each day? I know
you’re not superman (or superwoman), and that’s okay. Better to do
these important chores daily at whatever time works than not at all.
You owe it to your pet, because she depends on you for structure.
Plenty of love is great, but it isn’t enough to make your Dachshund
happy, healthy, and secure.
Many dogs are surrendered to animal shelters because their owners
never bothered to fully housetrain them, and then they got tired of
cleaning up after them. The next time you think crate-training or
any other housetraining method is cruel, remember that surrender-
ing your Dachshund to an animal shelter is much crueler. Do the
kind thing and housetrain your Dachshund with consistency and
vigilance (see Chapter 13). And remember: Dogs love their dens 
(or, they learn to love them)!
Attending Obedience Classes (For
Your Dachshund and You)
Going to obedience classes when your puppy is about 3 months
old creates a firm foundation for future training. It teaches both
you and your Dachshund good habits and provides a structure 
to follow at home. Classes can help you communicate better with
your pet, because a trained instructor teaches you how to train your
Dachshund. Classes also help you feel more committed to your
dog and invested in your dog’s future behavior. Classes are fun 
and informative, and you get personalized attention to your dog’s
unique needs. Plus, your Dachsie learns how to meet and greet
other dogs nicely.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
154

And if you and your Dachshund love it, you can continue on with
more advanced classes — possibly even training for professional
competition (see Chapter 15).
No matter how good you think you are at training your Dachshund
at home, obedience classes are a great experience for both you and
your Dachshund. Every dog should experience them — as long as
their owners can find good trainers. A seasoned dog trainer should
give you ideas and strategies that hadn’t occurred to you. He or she
can help you deal with individual problems or tendencies of your
own pet — something no book can do. Also, learning good behavior
in a place other than your living room, and in the presence of other
dogs, will help your Dachshund see that training applies every-
where, not just at home.
But not all obedience classes are the same. You need to look for a
teacher who advocates positive training methods rather than rough
methods — such as the use of a choke chain. You certainly should
avoid those who use leash jerks for corrections. Rough methods
aren’t necessary for training Dachshunds, in the opinion of many
contemporary trainers. If used incorrectly or too harshly, they can
injure your Dachshund’s back.
To start the process of finding a good trainer, try the following
sources:
 Ask your vet to recommend a good local trainer.
 Ask your dog’s breeder, who may know just the right person.
 Ask friends with well-behaved dogs where they learned how
to train their pets.
Chapter 12: Determining Your Trainer Profile 155
Have some class: Avoid 
dumping at the shelter
According to a study published in 2000 in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare
Science, the pet owners who relinquished dogs to 12 U.S. animal shelters broke
down into the following categories:
 70 percent said their dogs had never been taught basic commands.
 Less than 6 percent said that they took their dogs to obedience class.
 Only 2 percent said they had their dogs trained by professional trainers.

 Contact the Association of Pet Dog Trainers — an organization
devoted to better dog training through education, and a great
advocator of positive training methods. You can search for an
APDT-certified trainer in your area at www.apdt.com (click on
Dog Trainer Search) or you can give the organization a call at
1-800-PET-DOGS. Call Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
After getting a referral, visit the instructor to gauge your interest.
Ask the instructor running the obedience class to explain his or her
personal philosophy of training. (If he or she is too busy to be inter-
viewed, look elsewhere. Would your child’s teacher refuse a parent-
teacher conference?) What are his or her influences? What methods
have proved most effective? Does he or she have any experience
training Dachshunds? Also, ask for his or her references and check
them. Sometimes, a recommendation or a warning from a previous
customer tells you more than a trainer ever could.
If you hear terms like lure-and-reward training, clicker training, or play
training, that’s a good sign. But watch out for comments about choke
collars, corrections, and discipline. Perhaps your Dachshund may
occasionally need a raised voice, a stern look, or a timeout, but in
obedience class, the training should be all about rewarding the good
stuff. This is how Dachshunds learn best.
Lure-and-reward training is a method in which a lure, such as a treat
or piece of kibble, is used to physically guide your dog into a posi-
tion, such as a sit. Clicker training is a method in which a click from 
a plastic device (called a clicker) is associated with a food treat.
Eventually, the click itself becomes rewarding to the dog and is used
as a positive reinforcement for desired behavior. Play training is a
method in which practice of certain commands is disguised as play.
Don’t forget your intuition. If a trainer just seems wrong, for what-
ever reason, keep looking. If you feel good about a trainer and his or
her methods make sense to you — they seem humane, kind, and in
the best interest of the dogs — feel free to sign up.
Good luck and don’t delay. Start training your Dachshund today!

You’ve been worrying about training your new Dachshund,
haven’t you? What new dog owner doesn’t? Bad behavior is 
a major cause of puppy and dog abandonment to animal shelters,
and the saddest part is that the puppies and dogs aren’t even to
blame. They pay the price for their owners’ lack of knowledge and
commitment to preventing and dealing with behavior problems in
the first place.
But that won’t happen to your Dachshund, because you’re fully pre-
pared to teach him how to behave himself in a human world. Right?
Good. In this chapter, I review all the training tips that you and your
Dachshund can really sink your teeth into. Good luck, and may your
Dachshund soon be the best-behaved dog on the block.
Housetraining 101
Admit it. Housetraining is your biggest worry. Nobody likes to mop
up puppy pee and scoop up puppy poop. And maybe you’ve heard
that Dachshunds are harder to train than some breeds. I’ll admit it,
it’s true — they are. But they aren’t as hard as some breeds, either.

The Mini Dachshund can be the most challenging Dachsie to train,
but all Dachshunds have a stubborn streak. You get to go to the
bathroom inside the house. Why shouldn’t he? But even if you think
he has a point with this Dachshund-centric argument, don’t give in
to stained carpets and a stinky house. You can housetrain your
Dachshund.
Wouldn’t it be great if your Dachshund never had a single accident
in the house? It’s possible. Difficult, but possible. Most importantly,
if you do slip up (notice I say if you slip up, not your pup), don’t
give up hope. Clean up the mess, clean it well, and resolve to not
let it happen again.
Few sights please a new dog owner like the sight of the little guy
doing his duty in the proper location. Others may find this preoccu-
pation slightly repulsive, but when your puppy squats or starts to
poop in the right spot (outside, on the newspaper, or wherever you
decide), don’t be surprised if you suddenly begin to cheer out loud.
And you should! (Just don’t startle the puppy into stopping what
he’s doing.) Each successful bathroom venture puts you one step
closer to housetraining success, and when you’ve housetrained a
Dachshund, you know you’ve accomplished something major.
For some puppies and even adult dogs, housetraining is a long, 
protracted battle between dog and human, sometimes lasting for
months. No one should have to put up with that — human or dog.
And who wants to? You can eliminate elimination battles with a little
knowledge and two to four weeks of extreme vigilance (maybe a
little longer with a Mini Dachshund). The following sections show
you the way. When your Dachshund is sleeping through the night
and asking politely to be let out during the day, you know you have
it made.
Understanding the elimination
process
Puppies don’t pee and poop at random. A very specific process 
happens inside them (and inside dogs and even humans of all ages)
called the gastrocolic reflex, which is the internal mechanism that
governs the elimination process. Eating triggers this reflex. The
body makes room for new food by expelling the remains of old food
in the colon. The result? Somewhere between 5 and 60 minutes after
a puppy eats, he needs to poop. And after your puppy’s tiny bladder
fills up enough from drinking water, he’ll need to pee also.
Every dog is different. Some puppies need to go out a lot, and others
not so often. But the younger a puppy is, the more often he’ll need
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
158

to go. As he gets older, he’ll learn to hold it longer. Your job is to
know your dog’s timetable.
You can figure out your puppy’s timetable by taking him out every
two hours during the first few weeks and watching him carefully.
When you have it down, you’ve conquered a major housetraining
hurdle. Take your puppy out on a regular schedule (see the next
section), and always reward a successful bathroom effort with
praise and the occasional treat; soon enough, your incorrigible
little Dachshund will be fully housetrained — and sooner than 
you expected.
Your detailed guide to housetraining
Now that you have the basic principles down (after reading the 
previous section), you can discover how housetraining will work in
your busy day. Take a look at these guidelines, or post them on your
refrigerator (and for more reading, check out Housetraining For
Dummies, by Susan McCullough [Wiley]).
If you decide to paper-train your Dachshund — or, like one senior
owner I know, allow him to use the extra shower stall as his “litter-
box” — the same guidelines apply, except that you whisk him off to
his inside elimination station.
 Before bringing your puppy inside the house for the very
first time, take him to his elimination station while he’s still
attached to his leash and stay there until he does his duty.
If he won’t eliminate, take him inside, put him in his den, 
close the door, and tell him in a gentle voice that you’ll be back.
Return in 15 minutes and try again. Don’t take him anywhere
else in the house until he has eliminated in his special spot.
 Every two hours during the day for the first week, take him
out to his special spot.
If he doesn’t go, bring him in and put him in his den (nicely —
don’t get mad or none of this will work). Return every 20 to 30
minutes and try again until he goes. (Note: Your puppy may
have a stronger bladder, and you may find that you can take
him out every three or four hours rather than every two. But
start with two-hour intervals until you know your Dachshund’s
tendencies.)
If you have to work all day and nobody will be home, have
someone come by every few hours to let out your puppy. If you
can’t find a willing friend or family member, consider hiring a pet
sitter. These professionals spend much of their days walking and
Chapter 13: Teaching Your Dachshund the House Rules 159

playing with puppies and adult dogs for people who can’t get
home from work for long periods of time.
 Within 30 minutes of a meal, take him outside until he goes.
After you learn your puppy’s e-time (see the section “Timing is
everything”), you can alter this step to fit your puppy’s needs.
 For the first week, take your puppy out every four hours
during the night.
Set your alarm if you have to, but your Dachshund will proba-
bly wake you up. (If he’s sleeping soundly, you can wait it out,
but don’t miss the opportunity when he wakes up.)
 Always take your puppy out first thing in the morning, at
the same time each morning, and immediately before bed-
time, at the same time each evening.
Sorry, that means on weekends, too! Continue this habit
throughout your Dachshund’s life. (You can always go back 
to bed after the bathroom break.)
 Never, ever miss the sniff-and-circle routine.
If you or someone else can’t watch him, let your puppy rest in
his crate where he’ll be much less likely to have an accident.
For the first couple of weeks, be extra vigilant. It could happen
any time, even when an elimination session isn’t scheduled.
After your Dachshund is housetrained, keep the concept in the
back of your mind. Everyone forgets about letting the dog out
every now and then. And note that after an extra-big meal, your
Dachshund may need more outside time than usual.
 For the first couple weeks, keep your Dachshund in uncar-
peted areas whenever he’s out of his den.
Cleanup will be much easier, and the scent won’t last like it
will in carpet. (Purchase a reliable odor remover specifically
designed for pet odors; see Chapter 8.)
 If your Dachshund makes a mistake, remember that it’s
your fault, not your Dachshund’s.
Don’t get mad. You can behave with urgency when whisking
your Dachshund outside if you catch him in the act. You can
say “No!” sternly and even sharply, which may interrupt him
mid-accident so you can get him outside before he finishes.
But don’t yell at him (even if you’re extremely irritated, which
you very well may be), and for your dog’s sake, don’t hit him
or rub his nose in his transgression (or, I should say, your
transgression). He won’t get it. He really won’t. It will just
make things worse, and he’ll learn to fear you.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron)

Dachshunds are fastidious, clean animals, and they lack the typical
hound-dog odor. They don’t want to eliminate in a manner that dis-
pleases you, and they don’t want to mess up their living environ-
ments. They need only a little guidance from you to do what makes
everyone happy. Be a patient, consistent, and loving housetrainer.
To help you keep track of when to take your Dachshund outside in
the first week, make a copy of Table 13-1 (or make your own version)
and circle the appropriate time of each successful elimination. The
chart lists times in two-hour intervals throughout the day and four-
hour intervals throughout the night, assuming that your Dachshund
gets up at 7 a.m. and goes to bed at 11 p.m. Times are approximate.
Modify them for your own schedule.

Common housetraining errors
Don’t fall prey to these common housetraining mistakes and you’ll
have a big-boy puppy in no time:
 Missing your puppy’s sniff-and-circle routine
 Leaving your puppy unattended before he’s fully trained
Chapter 13: Teaching Your Dachshund the House Rules 161

 Not taking your puppy to the same place for elimination each
and every time on his leash
 Allowing your puppy to eat or drink water after about 7 p.m.
If he’s really thirsty, let him drink water but be sure to take
him out again before bedtime.
 Not taking your puppy out immediately before you put him 
in his kennel for the night
 Letting your puppy sleep outside his crate for the first week
Biting, Gnawing, Chewing —
Nixing All Toothy Indiscretions
Puppies bite, and if you didn’t know it before you brought your
Dachshund home, you surely know it by now (see Figure 13-1 for
an example of a Dachsie that may be just waiting to gnaw on some-
thing!). Sometimes called mouthing, puppy biting is really just oral
exploration. Great for puppies. Not so great for new shoes, chair
legs, wall moldings, and the human fingers that are often the 
subjects of their inquiry.
Figure 13-1: Without training, he’ll chew on you and everything you hold dear!

Some people think that puppy mouthing is cute and like to 
excuse it because it’s a puppy’s way of exploring the world. But 
you won’t think the behavior is so cute when your puppy becomes
an adult dog and is still shredding your possessions and nipping at
people whenever they annoy him or he wants their attention. To a
Dachshund, even a “Hey, cut that out!” is better than being ignored.
The following sections inform you of all the necessary biting info
and help you nip the nipping in the bud.
Don’t let him chew on just anything!
Puppy teeth are sharp as needles. That’s just one reason to dis-
courage the mouthing of human flesh and other objects, but there
are other reasons:
 Letting your puppy chew on your fingers teaches him that
chewing is okay. You aren’t doing your puppy any favors.
Others won’t be as indulgent as you, but your puppy won’t
know that. He’ll only know that chewing fingers must be fine
because you let him do it.
The first important measure you must take to nip indiscrimi-
nate mouthing in the bud is to never allow your puppy to chew
on your fingers. If he tries, don’t let him. Keep your hands away
from his mouth. If he accidentally gets a mouth full of fingers,
quickly remove them and say “No!” If he never gets a chance to
chew on you, he’ll be less likely to give it a thought.
If your puppy bites at your fingers, you can try placing your
thumb under his tongue, holding his lower jaw gently but
firmly, and saying “No teeth” for 10 to 20 seconds. This 
usually stops finger biting completely within one week.
 Because puppies love to chew everything, you must make 
it very clear which things are okay to chew and which are 
not. Your puppy must learn that a few select objects are 
chewable — and nothing else. This rule sets the stage for
good oral behavior for the rest of your puppy’s life. Never
vary it.
Objects your puppy shouldn’t chew include furniture, shoes,
toilet paper, string, as well as anything he could choke on,
destroy, or that could injure him. Use your common sense.
Prevention is best.
However, you can’t store your sofa away for the first year of
your puppy’s life. Same goes for the dining room chair, tables,
and any other large piece of furniture your Dachshund takes a
fancy to. If your dog insists on chewing these things, liberally
Chapter 13: Teaching Your Dachshund the House Rules 163

apply some Bitter Apple or other chew-deterrent spray
according to the instructions.
You can also give your puppy a quick, harmless squirt from a
water bottle or shake a soda can with pennies in it to grab his
attention. You can even employ the ultrasonic sound from an
electronic device called Pet Agree. This gets a puppy’s atten-
tion painlessly but effectively so you can redirect him from
what he’s doing. That’s when you employ your secret weapon:
a well-placed chew toy (see the following section).
If your Dachshund has never been a big chewer but suddenly
becomes destructive or chews obsessively (including self-
chewing), he may have a medical problem. Visit your vet and 
have him checked out. Skin problems, allergies, epilepsy, separa-
tion anxiety, or any number of other disorders may be the cause.
Some dogs suffer from a condition, similar to obsessive-compulsive
disorder in humans, that causes them to chew obsessively. Many
conditions can be effectively treated by a veterinarian.
Whatever method you use to nip biting in the bud, you’ll be devel-
oping something called bite inhibition in your young puppy’s brain.
He’ll learn that he’s not supposed to bite. If you never teach him,
he’ll never know this important bit of information about living with
humans — and adult Dachshunds have strong jaws and big teeth.
Harnessing the power of 
a well-placed chew toy
Some Dachshunds chew on things more than others, and some
Dachshunds aren’t interested in any toy but their favorite. For the
exuberant chewers, you can make use of a well-placed chew toy at
every opportunity. Store safe, sturdy chew toys all over the house so
that whenever your Dachshund gets too interested in chewing your
fingers, toes, shoes, or furniture, you can immediately remove him
with a firm “No” and then hand him an acceptable option. When he
chews the toy instead, heap on the praise. “What a good dog!”
Your detailed guide 
to bite prevention
Ah, just what you’ve been waiting for. Here are the detailed guide-
lines to follow with your new dog in order to say good-bye to painful
puppy bites and destructive chewing:
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
164

 From the first moment you meet your new puppy, never, ever
let him chew on you or anyone else.
Pull your fingers away and say “No!” and then give him a chew
toy. Praise him when he chews it.
 From the first moment you meet your new puppy, never,
ever let him chew on anything you don’t want him to chew
on when he becomes an adult.
Apply some chew-deterrent spray according to the instructions
and distribute chew toys around the house.
 Keep chew toys in every room in which your puppy is
allowed — plus one in his den and one in the car if he 
travels with you.
Whenever he even thinks about chewing something forbid-
den, pop a chew toy in his mouth. He’ll soon associate the
chewing urge with a chew toy.
And if you catch him in the act, pull the old switcheroo:
Remove him from the bad object and replace the void with
the good chew toy.
 Not sure how to anticipate when your puppy feels like 
chewing? Watch him.
Some puppies start to chomp their jaws or lick their lips and
look around.
 Never fly off the handle because your puppy has chewed
something forbidden.
You either left an object out when you shouldn’t have or
weren’t supervising his play. Guide him toward good behavior
and don’t reinforce bad behavior by making a big fuss.
Chapter 13: Teaching Your Dachshund the House Rules 165
Help! Dachsie’s a demolition machine!
Some people complain that their Dachshunds destroy things when left alone. If you
have a destructive chewer and must leave him alone, you need to keep him safely
confined when you’re away. Destructive dogs don’t just wreck your stuff, they risk
injuring themselves by choking, mouth and throat lacerations, intestinal obstruc-
tion, and even poisoning. Your Dachshund won’t mind naps in his den, as long as
you don’t keep him in there for more than four or five hours without a break.

That’s it. The tricky part is to be eternally consistent. Always
enforce the rules. If you miss an enforcement opportunity, move on.
Certainly don’t punish your Dachshund; resolve never again to let
him chew anything he shouldn’t chew. I know, you’re only human.
But do your best — the more consistent you are, the faster your
Dachsie will learn.
Convincing Your Little 
Barker to Quiet Down
If you have a Dachshund, you have a barker. Dachshunds bark for
many reasons — some of them reasonable and some of them unrea-
sonable. It isn’t fair to get annoyed or angry at your Dachshund for
occasional barking. He’s been bred to bark for good reasons. But
obsessive or unnecessary barking is something you can address
and, in most cases, resolve. But how do you do it? The first step is 
to understand why your Dachsie is barking. The following sections
take you there and beyond.
Barking too much can be harmful for your Dachshund’s health. If
he barks obsessively, he puts himself under a lot of physical stress.
Obsessive barking can also be a sign of a health problem or a sign
that your Dachshund is particularly insecure or fearful (or just
mind-numbingly bored). Barking also is harmful for you. At best,
you’ll find yourself continually irritated with your Dachshund. At
worst, your neighbors won’t be happy with you, and if you live in
an apartment, you could be asked to leave or even be evicted if the
noise becomes too bothersome.
Understanding why 
Dachshunds bark
Dachshunds bark more than some breeds because barking was 
part of the original Dachshund plan. When used in hunting, a
Dachshund would corner its prey and then bark loudly and sharply
to alert the hunter or farmer to come and finish the job. Sometimes,
the Dachshund’s bark had to be heard across great distances, or
even from underground.
So, even if you don’t hunt with your Dachshund, you’ll still reap the,
ahem, “benefits” of centuries of breeding. It isn’t his fault, but it is
something you should be prepared for.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
166

Today, your Dachshund will bark for many reasons:
 Someone is invading his territory (his house, yard, human).
 Something resembles a threat, and he thinks you should be
alerted.
 Something resembles prey (a squirrel, a cat, a piece of trash
blowing down the street), and he wants to get it.
 He wants to get out of wherever you’ve put him (a pen, a den, 
a room with a gate or closed door, a yard with a fence).
 He wants your attention or wants you to return after 
you’ve left.
 He’s really excited.
 He’s suspicious or fearful of someone or something, such as a
visitor or a noise (for example, a ringing phone or doorbell).
 He’s bored or wants you to stop ignoring him right now.
Some of these reasons are justifiable — even desirable. If a stranger
is invading your property, you want to know about it, and your
Dachshund is just the guy to tell you. In such a case, you can deter-
mine who the invader is, and then you can show your Dachshund
that the person is okay by letting in the visitor, or you can call the
police. Praising your Dachshund for alerting you to the presence of
trespassers (good or bad ones) is perfectly acceptable. “Thank you,
good boy! Now you can be quiet.” However, your Dachshund also
needs to know when to stop.
Removing the cause of 
unwanted barking
Centuries of breeding aside, you shouldn’t have to listen to unrea-
sonable barking all day. You can stop barking by removing the cause.
Doing so involves determining the cause first, of course (see the 
previous section).
But after you determine the cause of your dog’s unreasonable 
barking, you don’t want to encourage it. Heed the following tips:
 If your Dachshund barks at everything that moves outside the
front window, you need only to keep him from looking out the
front window. Draw the blinds or close the curtains, or keep
your Dachshund in another room.
 If a squirrel is teasing your Dachshund in the backyard, bring
your Dachshund inside.
Chapter 13: Teaching Your Dachshund the House Rules 167

 If the neighborhood kids are teasing your Dachshund through
the fence, shame on them. Call their parents.
 If your Dachshund barks frantically whenever you leave him
alone, begin keeping him in his den when you’re away. Also
practice keeping him in his den when you’re home so that he
knows his den is a safe place and doesn’t always indicate your
absence. Don’t talk to your dog when he’s in the den, though.
This increases the likelihood of anxiety problems.
Talk to your vet or a trainer about strategies to address severe
separation anxiety if this is a problem. Separation anxiety 
can be effectively treated by a professional, especially if 
caught early.
 If your Dachshund is really excited and barking up a storm,
calm him down. A few happy barks uttered out of sheer joy
when you and your Dachshund are playing together won’t
hurt anything, however.
 If your Dachshund is bored, give him something to do.
Sometimes a five-minute, rousing game of fetch or a few favorite
toys and a Kong stuffed with a couple of biscuits is all it takes
(see Chapter 14 for more on the importance of play).
If your Dachshund is suspicious or fearful of particular noises, 
you can desensitize him to these sounds by exposing him to them
over and over while keeping him safe and giving him treats. You
want him to associate the sounds with rewards rather than fear.
Desensitization turns a negative into a positive. Ask a behaviorist or
trainer for tips on how to do this — especially if you’re unsure about
it or if your Dachshund seems severely traumatized by harmless
sounds or objects. You don’t want to make the problem worse.
After you eliminate all the causes you can and help your
Dachshund resolve any irrational fears, your next step is to train
your dog not to bark (see the following section).
Generally, I would never recommend having your dog debarked —
a surgical procedure that alters your dog’s vocal cords to lessen
the volume of barking — unless the only alternative is to abandon
the pet or face legal action. In fact, many vets now refuse to do this
surgery because they believe it’s cruel.
Also, shock collars and citrus spray collars are designed to dis-
courage barking, but they punish a dog for behaving according to
instinct. However, in severe cases of obsessive barking, these kinds
of collars may be helpful, distracting the dog from his barking and
giving you a chance to intervene and calm him down or redirect
him. This is certainly preferable to debarking. Talk to your vet for
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
168

more information if you have a severe case, but don’t be too quick
to use any of these solutions. Give training a fair chance first.
Manipulating your Dachshund’s
instincts
Training your dog not to bark requires an effort contrary to your
human instinct. First, when he barks, you must show no emotion
whatsoever except, perhaps, for a quiet disdain. Yelling and making
a big fuss only reinforces his behavior, because he thinks you’re
barking along with him.
Basically, there are two major keys to training your Dachshund not
to bark unreasonably:
 Remember that some barking is justified and desirable.
 Never, ever react to unreasonable or undesirable barking in any
way except to dispassionately remove your Dachshund from
the source of the barking when possible.
That isn’t so hard to remember, is it?
Jumping: Not Joyous for Everyone
Dachshunds get so excited. They want so desperately to capture
their humans’ attention. They want to see what’s going on, and
that’s hard to do when they live so close to the ground. You can
almost hear them thinking: “How can I help but jump up? It’s a fasci-
nating, stimulating, and exhilarating world up there above my head!”
Don’t buy it for a minute. Your Dachshund doesn’t have to jump up
on you or anybody else — ever. He can see just fine, and you, as his
tall friend, have the responsibility of getting down to his level every
so often. It’s only fair if you don’t want him to try to ascend to 
your level.
Fortunately, Dachshunds aren’t very big, so they won’t knock you
down if they jump on you. Jumping is, nonetheless, bad manners,
and your friends and neighbors may not think it’s as cute as you do.
Plus, jumping can put an unnecessary strain on your Dachshund’s
back. If you train your puppy not to jump from day one, everyone
will be impressed with how well-mannered and restrained your little
Dachshund is. Hop on to the following sections to find out how.
Chapter 13: Teaching Your Dachshund the House Rules 169

How you inadvertently 
encourage jumping
If your Dachshund jumps, he does it because you encourage it. Yes,
you do. Encouraging jumping is all too easy. All it takes is a look, a
smile, or any other sign of pleasure or attention that very first time
your Dachshund applies his front paws to your lower legs.
Here’s a scenario for you: You get home after a long afternoon. You
can’t wait to see your new puppy (it’s been since lunch, after all —
or longer if you have a dog walker or pet sitter). You open the door
to his den, and he comes bounding joyfully toward you. Your face
lights up as your puppy leaps up against your legs. How cute! You
smile and say, “Good dog!” And you scoop your puppy into your
arms. You’re both in heaven.
You’ve just “told” your puppy that he gets a great big reward if 
he jumps up on you. Now he’ll do it again and again and try it on
others, and he’ll keep doing it until he’s full grown. If you suddenly
get mad at him when he does it, he won’t understand why. He’ll
think you’re unpredictable and maybe a little bit scary. But he
won’t think, “Oh, I guess now I shouldn’t jump up anymore.”
Re-training your jumper
If you’ve already reacted with positive reinforcement to your jump-
ing puppy, don’t despair. It isn’t too late to reteach your Dachshund
that jumping isn’t allowed. Even jumping adult Dachshunds can
learn not to jump. Getting mad isn’t the way to teach, however.
Every single time you come home or even into a room and your
puppy runs to you and jumps up, you need to do something very
difficult: Completely ignore him. Don’t talk to him and don’t look 
at him. Pretend he isn’t even there. Wait it out. He’ll be confused at
first. He’ll probably try to jump with even greater fervor. Eventually,
though, he’ll give up. Don’t give up before he does.
When your puppy stops jumping on you, turn toward him and
really pile on the praise. Get way down low so he can see your face.
That’s what he was trying to do, anyway. “Helloooo, puppy! Whatta
good doggy! I missed you soooo much!” Pet him, offer him a treat —
whatever will make him happy. You’ve just rewarded him for 
not jumping!
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
170

If, in the process of your praises, he jumps on you again, completely
turn it off. Ignore him again. Don’t look at him and don’t speak.
When he stops jumping on you again, praise him again, giving 
him all your attention.
Your puppy may not get it immediately, but after a few times, he’ll
get the gist. Dachshunds are smart puppies! After that point, never,
ever reward him or pay any attention to him when he jumps on you.
As soon as he stops, however, immediately turn your full attention
on him with all the praise and petting you can muster.
You also can meet jumping with a blank expression and the word
“Sit.” When your dog sits, you can kneel down and praise him 
lavishly as he welcomes you home. (For more on training your
Dachshund how to “Sit,” see Chapter 14.)
If your puppy jumps on other people when they come to visit, have
them do the same thing. Instruct visitors before they come inside
about the plan. When your puppy quits jumping, a visitor can meet,
greet, and pet him.
Teaching an Older Dog New Tricks
If you’ve adopted an adult Dachshund (see Chapter 5), he may
already be housetrained, he may never bite or chew inappropriate
things, he may not bark inappropriately, and he may know never to
jump up on people. Or, more likely, he may need a little work on
any or all of these areas.
Teaching an adult Dachshund is essentially the same as teaching 
a puppy. All the steps and methods that work for puppies work 
for adults, too. Some adults take longer to learn because they’re
changing old habits. Others learn much faster because they’re more
mature and have more life experience with humans than a pup.
Maybe your adult dog used to be housetrained, got out of the habit,
but will remember it quickly. Or maybe he’s very eager to please
you, so he tries extra hard to learn the rules.
In any case, don’t assume that your adult Dachshund is untrain-
able. You know that line about not being able to teach an old dog
new tricks? Forget it. Old dogs are perfectly capable of learning
good house manners.
Chapter 13: Teaching Your Dachshund the House Rules 171

If your adult Dachshund seems to be having severe problems with
behavior, first call your vet to rule out a medical problem. Then con-
sider hiring a professional trainer and/or an animal behaviorist or
canine behavioral consultant. Your adult Dachshund may have expe-
rienced abuse or neglect in the past, or perhaps he’s never been
trained in any way. A professional can help you address his issues
and resolve them in the Dachshund’s best interests. Do everything
you can to help your adult dog adjust happily to his new home so
you can live together in peace. (See Chapters 12 and 14 for more on
this topic.)

 Remembering the importance of fun
A
fter you’ve conquered the house rules (see Chapter 13), you
can move on to more fun training activities. Personally, you
need a dog that’s housetrained and doesn’t bite or destroy things,
but your Dachshund needs stuff to do — a purpose in life. A dog that
can sit, roll over, speak, lie down, and heel on cue feels like she has
important work and loves displaying the tricks that impress family,
friends, and neighbors. (Applause doesn’t hurt a Dachshund’s ego,
after all.)
But training isn’t all about fun and games. It can also be a matter 
of life and death. If your untrained Dachshund slips out the front
door between the legs of someone who isn’t paying attention and
then dashes for a squirrel across the street, all you can do is hope
a car isn’t coming. But, in the case of a well-trained Dachshund,
you just may be able to get her to stop before she hits the street.
Unfortunately, you may not be successful either way, because the
instinct to give chase is strong in the Dachshund. But the better
trained your Dachshund is, the greater her chances for survival.
Add to that the fact that most Dachshunds abandoned to shelters
aren’t trained and you have more than enough reasons to start
teaching your Dachshund some basics today. This chapter is here 
to help.

Considering Obedience Classes
You may be fully committed to training your Dachshund at home.
Good for you. But that doesn’t mean you and your friend won’t both
benefit from a good obedience class. One of the biggest advantages
to an obedience class is the socialization. Obedience classes expose
your Dachshund to other dogs and humans so that your Dachsie
learns more about the world. This is important for molding a stable
and mature adult dog.
Socialization is the process of teaching an animal about the social
world humans live in: what all kinds of other people and animals
are about. This process helps puppies become well-adjusted and
confident, less likely to be fearful or aggressive, and able to make
smart decisions about which people and animals are friendly and
which are threats. Knowledge is power, and that’s exactly what
socialization delivers to your Dachshund.
Obedience classes also teach your pup that you make the rules and
that he must follow your lead no matter where you are. Classes give
you some great new tips and tricks that you may not find in training
books. Plus, I know how it feels to read something about training
that makes perfect sense, only to start training and think, “Now, why
isn’t this working on my dog?” Professional teachers can address
specific problems and see what you may be doing wrong.
Even if you register for nothing more than a puppy kindergarten 
or puppy socialization class, you’ll be glad you did. You and your
Dachshund both need training and a structure for your daily 
sessions.
Puppy kindergarten describes classes for young puppies or dogs
that have never had any obedience training. These classes focus
on socialization, and you may also learn how to teach your puppy
some basic skills. You may even get help with housetraining and
other new-puppy problems you may be experiencing.
Finding a teacher
If you find a teacher with a method you love whose style really
works for you, you may find that you and your Dachshund can go
up, up, up to the highest echelons of obedience competition. Or, if
you’re not into competition, you’ll still have fun and learn a lot.
Finding a good teacher is important. Your veterinarian and/or
breeder can probably recommend an obedience instructor or two.
Also, ask other pet-owning friends which instructors they like and
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
174

why. Some dog trainers will come to your house and help you with
individual problems, which can work great for some Dachsies, but
classes give you both the added benefit of interacting with new
people and dogs.
Look for someone who teaches and uses positive training 
techniques (like praising good behavior) rather than negative 
techniques (like leash jerking). Also, look for someone you feel
comfortable with and whose style you can relate to. Ask to watch 
a class, and talk to the trainer about his or her methods. Cost and
location may also be factors for you, but don’t settle on a teacher
who doesn’t make you feel comfortable just because the class is
cheaper or closer.
Continuing your work at home
Obedience classes work best when you work every day with your
Dachshund at home. Consider it homework. In fact, most obedience
instructors really will give you homework assignments. When your
teacher tells you to practice twice a day for 10 to 20 minutes, she
means it. Otherwise, you’ll find that obedience classes have little 
if any effect on your Dachshund’s behavior. Beyond the essential
element of a positive and fun approach, obedience training is all
about two key concepts: consistency and persistency.
The ideal situation is holding two training sessions each day, 
but even one 5- or 10-minute session per day (adult dogs usually
can’t concentrate for much longer, and puppy sessions may be
much shorter) goes a long way toward establishing a training ritual
for you and your Dachshund. Make training just as important as
brushing your teeth (and brushing your Dachshund’s teeth!). Do 
it every day; you won’t regret it.
But what do you do every day? A good obedience instructor will give
you plenty of suggestions — maybe even a detailed format for your
homework. The training she gives you may resemble some of the
exercises in the following section. And if you haven’t registered for
your classes yet or you just want some variation, the puppy lessons
in the following section are just what you need.
Important Lessons for 
You and Your Puppy
Training your Dachshund keeps her life interesting, keeps her safe,
and keeps her out of the local shelters. This section covers some
Chapter 14: Putting Your Dachshund though Basic Training 175

basic lessons and commands you can teach your Dachsie. Each
lesson is simple, short, and fun — perfect for a puppy that’s just
learning the ropes or an adult dog that hasn’t experienced a training
session before.
For every lesson, be sure that you have a ready store of your dog’s
food (taken from her daily allowance) or very small treats so you
can immediately reinforce good behavior.
No matter how consistent and persistent you are in your training
sessions, if you don’t make training fun for your Dachshund, you can
forget the learning. A positive attitude, plenty of happy praise, and 
a sense of excitement are all essential elements to any Dachshund
training session. If you have an old-fashioned notion of discipline,
it’s time to get modern. The old adage “No pain, no gain” doesn’t
serve you or your Dachshund well. The surest way to tell whether
your Dachshund is having a blast is to consider whether you’re
having a blast. If the training is fun for you, it’s probably fun for
your Dachsie.
Getting a puppy’s attention
Puppies are notoriously distractible. How on Earth are you going
to teach your puppy to sit, let alone get her to pay attention to you
long enough to hear you say the cue “Sit”? First, you teach your
puppy when it’s time to listen:
1. Pick up your puppy and look her in the eye while saying
her name.
Some puppies will look you in the eye immediately — even
hold your gaze for a few seconds before twisting around to
see what else is going on that may be of interest. Others
will look anywhere but your eyes.
2. Follow with one of these actions:
• If she looks at you when you say her name, praise
her and give her a treat.
• If she won’t look you in the eye, start making funny
(nonthreatening) sounds.
Whistle, click your tongue, and say “Beep beep!” or
“Toodleoodleoodle” or whatever other funny sound
amuses you. (Remember, this should be fun for you,
too.) Note: Don’t use your puppy’s name for this one
yet. She probably hears it all the time, and you want
to emit a new sound that will capture her attention.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
176

As soon as she looks at you, smile happily, say “Good
dog!” and give her a treat.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 a couple more times.
4. Try the exercise with the puppy on the floor and you 
sitting in front of her.
When she gives you her attention, be enthusiastic. Play with
her joyfully, give her a treat, pet her gently — whatever she
really loves.
If, in Step 2, you had to go with the second option — making
funny sounds — continue with the rest of these steps.
5. After your Dachsie reliably turns her attention to you
when you make your funny sound, add her name to the
sound.
Do this, for example: “[whistle] Hans!” or “Beep beep, Hans!”
Continue to reward your dog enthusiastically every time she
gives you her attention.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 several times every day.
7. After several days, begin to drop the funny sound every
other time. After a few more days, use only your
Dachshund’s name to grab her attention.
Continue to reward her whenever she gives you her full
attention.
You can practice this lesson during walks, in the car, in the park, 
or wherever else you are with your Dachshund. Eventually, she’ll
learn that when you say her name, it’s in her best interest to pay
attention to you because something great is sure to happen.
Another way you can get a dog’s attention is by showing her a treat
and then holding it at arm’s length to your side. The dog will stare at
your hand and the treat. The instant she looks you in the eye, give
her the treat. This will establish great eye contact and command;
your Dachshund is listening. What will you tell her to do next?
You can, of course, name your dog whatever you like. Short names
(or short nicknames of long names) that are fun and easy to say
are most effective for training, however. Peter, Max, Trixie, and
Sport make better choices than Bartholomew, Zachariah, Veronica,
and Mary Margaret (although Bart, Zach, Vicky, and Meg would all
work well).
Chapter 14: Putting Your Dachshund though Basic Training 177

Teaching “Come”
“Come” is the most essential cue in your Dachshund’s repertoire.
That doesn’t mean she’ll always obey it, though. You’re doing pretty
well if she usually obeys it. However, she must learn it because it can
save her life someday.
The good news? It’s easy to get most puppies to come. Puppies are
curious, and they love people. If you squat down or lie down on the
floor, open your arms wide, and look excited while calling for your
puppy, she’s bound to come, well, bounding over.
The older a puppy gets, however, and the more familiar you get,
the less likely it is that you’ll seem like the most interesting thing 
in the room. (Don’t take it personally!) Your puppy may think, “Oh,
yeah. That guy. But hey, I’ve never seen that new shoe over there
before!” And when you get some serious competition, like a rabbit
in the garden or a robin on the driveway, forget it.
So how do you teach your puppy that “Come!” means come and
always means come, whether she feels like it or not? Habit, pure 
and simple. Dogs thrive on habit and routine. Practice the “Come”
cue every day, again and again, whenever you get the chance.
Always reward it. If you do it often enough, it will become second
nature, and your Dachshund will come without even thinking about
it. If your Dachshund sincerely believes that every time she comes
to you, something great will happen, you’ve made yourself more
interesting than that new shoe — at least for a few moments.
Here are the steps you must repeat for teaching the “Come” cue:
1. Get down close to your Dachshund’s eye level, about 5 
or 6 feet away.
2. Open your arms wide and, with as much excitement and
joy as you can muster, say “[puppy’s name], Come!”
Wave a treat in the air, if necessary. If she comes without
seeing the treat, give her one anyway to reward her.
3. When she comes to you, heap on the praise.
Really heap it on — this is the big one. “Whatta good good
good doggie! What a well-behaved perfect little puppy! She
can come, yes she can!” Pet, kiss, play, and offer a treat —
make it worth your Dachshund’s while.
4. Move back another 5 or 6 feet and try it again.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
178

If your puppy follows you before you’ve said “Come,” say
“Come” as she’s following you. “Come, Spot! Whatta good
Spot! Come! Thatta girl! Come, Spot!”
5. Do it again and again, until your Dachshund loses interest.
Probably five times is the most you’ll get in at once. Work
through the lesson again later. And again and again and
again in the days after.
After your Dachshund understands “Sit” and “Wait” (see the 
following section), you can combine them with “Come.” Have your
Dachshund sit, tell her to wait, and then walk away. Then say
“[puppy’s name], Come!” Three cues for the price of one!
Here are two very important things to remember, so read up:
 Never go for one day without practicing “Come” a few times.
Your goal is to have the sound of the word “Come” induce such
a familiar and practiced response in your Dachshund that she
obeys without even thinking about it.
 If you use food rewards for only one cue, “Come” should be
the one. If you reward your Dachshund in a way that makes a
big impression every single time she comes when you call her,
she’ll be more likely to obey you every single time you call her.
Teaching “Sit”
When your Dachshund has learned to pay attention to you when
you address her (see the previous section), you can begin to add
words to her name to signify different behaviors. But how do you
get your Dachshund to know what you want her to do? Through
the magic of lure-and-reward training.
Even before your Dachshund knows her name, you can lure her into
a sit with a piece of kibble or a treat. You can even try the following
lesson with puppies that you’re visiting at the breeder’s house to see
which ones are most responsive to you:
1. Put your puppy in front of you — preferably up on 
a table so that you can be close to her eye level.
2. If she isn’t standing, lift her up to a standing position.
3. Pick up a piece of kibble and hold it in front of her nose,
as shown in Figure 14-1.
Put it just close enough for her to see and smell it but not
close enough for her to grab it.
Chapter 14: Putting Your Dachshund though Basic Training 179

Figure 14-1: Let your Dachsie see and sniff the kibble before having her sit.
4. When your puppy notices the treat, slowly raise the treat
up in the air and slightly over your puppy’s head.
How can she resist? She must try to follow it. But to do so,
she has to raise her head, and to raise her head, she has 
to sit.
5. As your Dachshund sits, say “Sit” in a relaxed and friendly
manner and then immediately praise her.
“Good sit! Whatta good dog!”
6. When she’s fully seated, give her the treat without delay.
“Whatta good dog! Whatta good little Gretel!”
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 once or twice, and then try the
exercise on the floor.
Eventually, your puppy will associate the action with the
word, but don’t rush to get rid of the treat. Keep practicing
for at least a couple of weeks, and if she doesn’t get it, keep
using the lure for a while longer.
8. When she’s very familiar with the Sit cue, practice holding
the sit.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
180

In other words, after she’s in the sit, don’t give her the food
immediately. Hold it over her head while you say “Wait” in
a friendly and relaxed tone. Wait for two seconds to give
her the treat.
9. Gradually, over the course of several weeks, increase the
time between the sit and the reward.
Go from 2 seconds to 5, 10, 20, and 30 seconds, and then go
for a minute. Vary the wait so she never knows how long it
will be. Sit, wait, reward.
Later on down the road, when you want your Dachshund to
sit for longer periods of time — say, while you get her dinner
prepared or when you have to take a phone call — you can
say “Sit, Wait” and then go about your business. When you
give your pup a treat, you release her. You should also prac-
tice the extended stay by using “Down” rather than “Sit”; it
will be more comfortable for your Dachshund. Find out how
to teach “Down” later in this chapter.
For long sits, accompany the treat reward with a release cue, such
as “Okay!” or “Go Play!” Eventually, you won’t even need the treat.
Your Dachshund will be happy to sit and wait for you. Of course,
she’ll always be happy to take a treat off your hands, too, so you
needn’t abandon the treat if you enjoy offering it occasionally.
Keep her guessing to keep her paying attention!
Teaching “Stand”
The “Stand” cue is great for grooming sessions, for dog shows, or 
for pauses during walks when you want to chat with a neighbor.
Follow the same steps that you use for teaching “Sit” (in the section
“Teaching ‘Sit’”), except that you lure your puppy into position in
the following way:
1. Put your puppy into a sitting position or have her sit 
by giving her the “Sit” cue.
2. After she’s sitting, hold a piece of kibble in front of her
nose until she notices it.
3. Pull the kibble in a straight line, parallel to the floor,
away from her nose.
To follow it, she’ll have to stand up.
4. As she stands, say “Stand” in a relaxed and friendly
manner.
Chapter 14: Putting Your Dachshund though Basic Training 181

5. When she’s fully standing, praise her and immediately
give her the treat.
Heap on the praise. “Good stand! Whatta good Butch!
Whatta good stand!”
6. Add the “Wait” cue, as described in the “Sit” cue section,
and then the release cue.
What a well-behaved Dachshund you have!
Teaching “Down”
The “Down” cue is good for getting your Dachshund under control.
It’s a more submissive position than the sit and can help to calm
your Dachshund when she’s getting overexuberant. Down also is 
an excellent position for extended waits. You can practice the long
down when you watch television, have to work at your computer,
when the family is having dinner, or when friends are visiting and are
ready for adult conversation. (Life can’t be about your Dachshund
all the time!)
Teach the Down cue after your Dachshund has mastered Sit with
the following steps:
1. Tell your Dachshund to sit, reward her when she does,
and then bring another piece of kibble into view.
Hold the new kibble just in front of your Dachshund’s nose.
2. When you have her attention, slowly lower the kibble to
the floor in a diagonal line, away from your puppy’s nose.
If she follows it with her nose but doesn’t lie down, move it
slightly away from her so that she has to lie down to reach 
it. If your Dachshund stands up to follow the kibble, moving
out of the sit, take the treat away and start over with the
“Sit” cue.
3. As she goes down to follow the treat, say “Down” in 
a friendly and relaxed tone.
4. When she lies down, give her the treat and pile on the
praise.
It may take a few tries for your Dachshund to figure out what
you mean. Plus, some Dachsies just don’t like to lie down.
They’d rather be up and at ’em. But when she gets it, make
lying down super rewarding; if you do, even the most active
Dachsie will probably be willing to do it . . . on occasion.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
182

It may help to train for “Down” when your Dachshund 
is tired — like after a walk or play session.
5. When your Dachshund understands “Down” and 
reliably lies down on cue, add the Wait cue.
Gradually extend the time between the down and the
reward — the same procedure you use for the long sit 
(see “Teaching ‘Sit’” for details).
You can add a release cue (like “Okay!”) after a long down
and practice it often. Whenever you plan to be in one place
for more than five minutes, practice the long down.
You can practice the long down during pauses on your daily walk,
but don’t make your Dachshund lie down on hot pavement. Let her
practice the “Down” cue on the grass.
Mastering the Leash
This section’s set of cues are for when you and your Dachshund 
are walking together — you on one end of the leash and your
Dachshund on the other. You may ask “Just who’s walking who?” 
as your Dachsie drags you down the sidewalk. The daily Dachshund
walk can be an immensely enjoyable experience, provided that your
Dachshund is well-behaved. If not, it can become an irritating and
trying task that you’ll probably soon abandon.
Lure-and-reward training doesn’t work with leash lessons because
they involve behaviors or actions that you can’t really lure your
Dachshund into. However, a few simple, alternative strategies will
make your Dachshund’s walk all it should be.
See every walk with your Dachshund as a training opportunity.
Practice the following lessons each and every time you and your
puppy venture outside.
A collar is more likely to strain and even injure your Dachshund’s
neck than a harness that fits around her shoulders and torso. A har-
ness can give you more control over your puppy and may be more
comfortable for your Dachshund. Check your local pet stores, online
pet supply companies, and mail-order pet supply catalogs for avail-
able harnesses. (See Chapter 8 for more on leashes, collars, and
harnesses.)
Chapter 14: Putting Your Dachshund though Basic Training 183

Teaching “Walk”
Few things are more irritating than a dog that continuously pulls
on her leash throughout an entire walk, and few things are more
humiliating than being dragged around the block by a 9-pound
wiener dog. Teach your Dachshund how to heel — walk nicely
beside you without pulling — by positively reinforcing heeling
behavior. Soon, your walks will be a joy. Just follow these steps:
1. Put on your Dachshund’s harness (or collar, if you
choose) and leash and then take her outside.
2. Stand next to your Dachshund with the leash in your
right hand and the Dachshund to your left.
The leash should hang loosely in front of you. Stand still.
Don’t talk to or look at your Dachshund. She’ll probably pull
a little, wander around a little, and sniff a little. Eventually,
she’ll get bored. (If she doesn’t, move to a more boring
location — say, the middle of a wide cement driveway.)
3. When she quits moving around and stands or sits next 
to you, look down happily and say “[puppy name], Walk”
and begin walking.
“Oh, joy!” your Dachshund thinks. “A walk! Hooray!” Off she
dashes.
4. The moment — no, the instant — you feel the tension 
on that leash tighten, stop.
Stand perfectly still. Don’t look at or talk to your Dachshund.
Don’t even say “No.” Just stop.
But this isn’t what your Dachshund expected. She thought
you were going for a walk. What gives? “C’MON!” she’s think-
ing. Don’t budge. Finally, your Dachshund will give up and
come back to you.
5. When she comes back to you, praise her and begin 
walking.
“Good dog! Let’s walk!” “Hooray!” She’ll lunge ahead again.
6. When she lunges ahead again, stop again.
Remain dead still. Now your Dachshund may be getting
pretty frustrated, but let her figure this one out. When she
stays by your side, you move, and the two of you get to walk.
Yippee! But when she pulls and lunges on the leash, you
stop. No walk. Boring!
7. Keep at this stop-and-go routine until she gets it.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
184

If she doesn’t get it today, she’ll get it soon. Every time she
stays at your side, say “Walk” and then walk. That’s the big
reward — one of the biggest in your Dachshund’s mind.
Here are a few more “Walk” tips:
 Never move when your Dachshund pulls on the leash, no
matter how old and experienced she gets. Never make an
exception. Even when she’s 10 years old, stop. Ignore her and
don’t move until she’s back at your side in a mannerly way. As
long as she stays at your side, the two of you can stroll as long
as you like. But if you give a Dachshund an inch, she’ll drag 
you a mile.
 After your Dachshund has learned to stay by your side on
walks, you can throw in a few curves — literally. Walk in an
arc to the right and to the left, walk backward, walk in a circle,
walk in a zigzag. See how well she can learn to tune in to your
movements — even anticipate them. If, at any time, she makes
a wrong move or puts any tension in that leash, always stop.
When your Dachshund has figured out the game, the “Walk”
cue can become great fun — kind of like a challenging guess-
ing game (and Dachsies love a challenge). It can also serve as
an excellent foundation for more advanced obedience work,
including the fun and creative freestyle competition (for more
on freestyle, see Chapter 15).
 After your Dachshund has mastered the “Walk” cue, you
can pick up the pace and change the cue to “Run.” But don’t
run too fast or for very long with your Dachshund. Because
their legs are so short, Dachshunds have to work twice as
hard as other dogs to keep up with you.
Teaching “Wait”
If you’ve been working on the long sit and long down, which I cover
earlier in this chapter, your Dachshund is probably already familiar
with the cue “Wait.” You can use this cue on your walks, too — at
crosswalks or when you stop to chat with a neighbor. Positively rein-
force your Dachshund when she waits patiently at your side in a sit
or a down.
Practice “Wait” on a walk only after your Dachshund has mastered
“Walk”:
1. While on your daily walk, whenever you approach a 
crosswalk or any other stopping point, say “[puppy name],
Wait” and then stop walking.
Chapter 14: Putting Your Dachshund though Basic Training 185

If your Dachshund keeps moving, stand completely still
and ignore her, just like you do when teaching the “Walk”
cue in the previous section.
2. As soon as she figures out that you’ve stopped and comes
to wait at your side, tell her to sit or lie down.
3. When she sits or lies down, praise her and offer her 
a treat.
4. When you’re ready to move again, give the “Walk” cue
and start walking as before. (You can throw in a “Stand”
first if you want to.)
Practice “Wait” a few times on every walk, in conjunction with “Sit”
or “Down” each time. Your neighbors will be so impressed!
Troubleshooting 101: Conquering
Training Problems
It’s easy to read about dog training. It sounds so simple, so obvious,
and so effortless. Then you sit down and try it, and it doesn’t always
go the way the book says.
Often, the problem is that you aren’t in the right mood. Or you just
don’t have the energy to enforce certain rules consistently. Or you
don’t train as regularly as you should, so your Dachshund forgets.
Following are a few common training problems and how to 
address them.
If you’re really having problems, go to obedience class or just give
your trainer a call (see the earlier section “Considering Obedience
Classes”). Many trainers will even come to your house to conduct
training sessions for your dog and for you, too! You’ll soon be back
on track.
 Your Dachshund won’t listen. Don’t be impatient with train-
ing. Go back to Lesson #1 — getting your dog’s attention. If
you don’t have your Dachshund’s attention, you can’t get any-
thing else done. Don’t proceed until she learns that when she
hears her name, something fun and good will come from your
direction. Move up slowly from there.
You can always go back to square one. And remember, your
Dachshund won’t listen to anything you have to say if you say
it like you’re extremely annoyed or bored. But if you have
something fun to say? Something great? Something so exciting
that no Dachshund would ever want to miss out on it? Now
you’re talking. (And your Dachshund is listening!)
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
186

 Your Dachshund won’t follow the lure. Impatience on your
part may be the culprit. You hold the treat in front of your
Dachshund and raise it up. Your Dachshund looks up, sits
halfway, and then stands. Do you say, “Close enough!” and 
give her the treat? Sitting halfway isn’t close enough, however,
and you’ve just rewarded your Dachshund for doing something
incorrectly. Don’t give her a treat, not even once, unless she
does something the way she’s supposed to. If she doesn’t get 
it on the first few tries, try again tomorrow. And the next day.
Some Dachshunds are slower to learn, but yours really does
want that treat, so keep trying until she understands.
Another reason for not following the lure could be that your
Dachshund just isn’t very hungry right now. It may help to train
her before her meal, when she’s hungrier; the treat will be a
more interesting motivation then.
 Your Dachshund has a very short attention span. Of course
she does, especially if she’s a puppy. Have you ever met a
human toddler? You get the point. Don’t worry if your training
sessions are effective for no longer than a couple minutes at
first. A few tries at “Come,” a play break, and one or two “Sits”
makes for a perfectly respectable training session for a young
puppy.
 Your Dachshund refuses to come. Try training in an area 
with fewer distractions. You have to be the most exciting thing
around for “Come” to work. If your backyard has many other
yards, dogs, and wildlife in view, forget it. You can practice
“Come” in the bathroom (put the trash away) or other rela-
tively empty room, with no other people or pets around. Also,
try training before a meal when your Dachshund may be hun-
grier or just after a nap when your Dachshund may be more
alert and well-rested.
If you’re really having a hard time with this cue, don’t use 
the word “Come” unless your puppy is on a leash so you can
slowly and gently pull him toward you. Then give him a treat.
This tactic will keep your puppy from getting confused about
what exactly you mean by Come.
 Kibble treats aren’t good enough. Different Dachshunds 
are food-motivated to varying degrees. If pieces of your
Dachshund’s regular kibble just aren’t motivation enough, try
healthy, homemade or store-bought treats broken into small
bits. Or try small pieces of healthy people food, like baby car-
rots, blueberries, oat cereal circles, or, for the Dachshund that
needs an extra push, very small slivers of cooked poultry or
meat (avoid processed meat like hot dogs and lunchmeat) or
low-fat shredded cheese.
Chapter 14: Putting Your Dachshund though Basic Training 187

 You keep getting angry. Puppies can be so frustrating. If you
can’t keep your cool, though, training simply won’t work. Anger
will only hurt your relationship with your Dachshund. Try train-
ing at a different time of day, when you’ll be in a better mood.
Also, maybe your training sessions are too long. Start with 
sessions that are only a couple minutes long. How irritated can
you get in two minutes? If you’re still having problems, you may
need to get to the root of your irritation. If something else is
bothering you, don’t take out your human troubles on your
innocent, if rambunctious, little Dachshund.
Keep working, keep trying, and never lose your sense of humor.
Most training traumas can be resolved if you stay creative and ask
for professional help when you need it.
Recognizing the Importance 
of Play
I can’t emphasize enough how important it is for you to keep 
training sessions cleverly disguised as play. Whatever you do with
your Dachshund should be fun. If you get bored, your Dachshund
is probably getting bored. If you get angry, your Dachshund is
probably getting frightened or at least thinking she’d like to put
some distance between herself and that big grumpy human.
Although Dachshunds can be stubborn, the way around their hard-
headedness isn’t through intimidation or violence. Manipulate with
charm and teach with joy, and you’ll soon convince your Dachshund
that doing what you say is what she wants more than anything else.
With a little patience and a sense of humor, you can do it. And your
Dachshund can’t wait for you to try!

Advanced Training and
Competing for Fun
In This Chapter
 Getting ready for competitions
 Shooting for a good manners award
 Competing in a variety of shows and athletic events
 Making versatility a priority for your Dachshund
W
ow! It turns out that your Dachshund is great at this training
stuff (see Chapter 14). He loves to learn new tricks, and the
two of you have great chemistry when it comes to training sessions
and obedience. Maybe you have a champion in the making. If you
want something else to do in your spare time that includes your
Dachshund, why not consider a little friendly competition?
The more you explore dog competitions, the more you may be sur-
prised at how endless your options are. You can travel the dog show
circuit, compete in traditional obedience competition — or its new,
easier version called Rally — and participate in field trials, agility
trials, and earthdog tests. Other fun events include canine freestyle,
tracking, and just plain showing off in front of your friends! And for
the truly well-rounded Dachshund (and I don’t mean chubby), 
a versatility award is perhaps the ultimate accomplishment.
But how do you get from interested dog-human team to champion
dog-human team? First, you train. This chapter takes you through
the process and outlines the many competitive and fun options
you have.

Preparing for Competition
If a particular dog sport or area of competition interests you, the
first thing you can do to prepare is to attend some events where
the sport or competition is featured. Your local all-breed dog club
or your regional breed club probably will have information about
the event(s) that interests you. Make a call. You also can look on
the American Kennel Club Web site for dog events near you. Search
simultaneously by area of interest and by state at www.akc.org/
events/search.
When you watch your competition of choice, you’ll probably come
up with a lot of questions about how it works. You can check out 
the section about your area of interest in this chapter and do some
research online by looking at the Web sites of clubs that sponsor 
the event — like the AKC, the UKC, or clubs specifically dedicated 
to your sport of choice. You also can look for books devoted to your
area of interest, which will tell you how to get started.
Depending on where you live, you may also be able to take a class
that will help you and your Dachshund train for events. Because
agility is so popular right now, a lot of local trainers offer agility
training classes. You can search for classes that focus on confor-
mation shows, obedience competition, and training for the Canine
Good Citizen test.
A basic obedience background is essential for any canine sport, 
so be sure your dog at least knows the basics (see Chapter 14). One
good place to start? Taking the Canine Good Citizen test. See the 
following section for details.
Taking the Canine 
Good Citizen Test
The Canine Good Citizen test is an exam that proves a dog has basic
good manners and can act like a good citizen in public. The purpose
of the test is to encourage all dog owners to teach their pets good
manners and proper behavior. If every dog possessed the skills nec-
essary to pass this test, surely the vast numbers of dogs abandoned
to animal shelters would decrease, as would the cases of dog-related
injuries. Any breed and any mixed breed of dog may take the test
and earn the award. Unlike many other types of canine competitions
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
190

where purebred status is a must, the Canine Good Citizen test is 
an equal-opportunity test — even if your Dachsie has a little, say,
Schnauzer blood or Beagle blood or something else.
You can train your Dachshund for the CGC test at home (although
training in a class may be easier). Knowledgeable members of local
dog clubs, 4-H clubs, or other clubs that promote the well being of
our canine friends usually administer the test. It involves ten individ-
ual tests, each determining how well your Dachshund can perform
according to basic good manners:
 Accepting a friendly stranger. Your Dachshund must remain
quiet and well behaved when a friendly but unknown person
approaches, speaks to you, and shakes your hand. While you
and the stranger talk pleasantly, your Dachshund must stay
next to you and not show any sign of guarding you, of shyness,
or of moving toward the stranger (barking and jumping up on
the person are no-nos).
 Sitting politely for petting. In this test, your Dachshund must
sit at your side while someone he doesn’t know approaches
and pets him on the head and body. The stranger must then
walk behind and around you and your Dachshund. Your
Dachshund must not act shy, aggressive, or resentful toward
the stranger. Again, no barking and jumping! (Don’t stop 
reading yet; your Dachsie really can do this!)
 Accepting grooming. The purpose of this test is to show 
that your Dachshund can be safely and easily examined 
and handled by a stranger, such as a vet, groomer, or friend.
The evaluator combs or brushes your Dachshund and gently
examines his ears and each front foot. Your Dachshund must
accept such handling without acting shy or aggressive.
 Controlling your dog for a walk on a loose leash. You must
demonstrate your control over your Dachshund for this test.
Walk with him on either side of you on a loose leash — meaning
no pulling on the leash for either of you. During your walk, you
must make one left turn, one right turn, one about turn (which
is turning around and going back the way you came), one stop
during the middle of the test, and another stop at the end. Your
Dachshund must stay in a good heel and may either sit or stand
during the stops.
 Walking through a crowd. Your Dachshund must demon-
strate his self control in a public place for this test. You 
and your Dachshund must walk around and by at least three
Chapter 15: Advanced Training and Competing for Fun 191

people, during which time your Dachshund may display inter-
est but not excitement, shyness, or resentment. You may direct,
encourage, and/or praise your Dachshund during this test, but
he must not pull on the leash and must remain at your side.
 Sit and Down on cue while staying in place. This test deter-
mines your Dachshund’s knowledge of basic commands. Ask
your Dachshund to sit and to lie down. You may make each
command more than once and may use more than one word.
(You can include your Dachshund’s name in the command, for
example, or add words of encouragement.) Next, you must ask
him to stay, after which you walk down a 20-foot line away from
him. During this walk, he must stay in place, although he can
change position (move from lying down to sitting, for example).
 Coming when called. Your Dachshund must demonstrate his
understanding of “Come” (see Chapter 14). In this test, you
must walk 10 feet from your Dachshund, with or without saying
“Stay.” Turn to face your Dachshund and call him to you. He
must come when called.
 Reacting properly to another dog. For this test, your
Dachshund must demonstrate his good manners around
another dog. No, really, stop laughing! I’m serious. With your
Dachshund on a leash, you must approach another handler
with another dog on a leash, standing approximately 10 yards
away. You and the other handler must stop, shake hands, talk
pleasantly, and then continue past each other for 5 yards. Both
dogs should show casual interest in each other but shouldn’t
leave their respective handlers’ sides and shouldn’t act shy 
or aggressive (or bark, roughhouse, or growl).
 Handling distractions. Distractions are a part of life, and in 
this test, your Dachshund demonstrates how confidently he
can handle them. The evaluator sets up some common distrac-
tions, such as a book being dropped to the floor or a jogger
running by. Your Dachshund must show some natural curiosity
in, and may even appear startled by, the distraction. But he
must not act aggressive or fearful, try to run away, or bark 
at the distraction.
 Staying calm during supervised separation. The last test
determines how well your Dachshund can behave when you
aren’t around to influence him. The evaluator says something
to the effect of “Would you like me to watch your dog?” and you
agree. Hand the leash to the evaluator and walk out of sight.
The evaluator holds your Dachshund’s leash for 3 minutes.
Your Dachshund needn’t maintain a Sit or Down position, but
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
192

he shouldn’t bark excessively, whine and cry, howl, pace, or 
act very nervous. Slight agitation is acceptable, because your
Dachshund really has no idea where you went, and he loves
you so!
During the CGC test, you have one chance at each test. If you 
fail, better luck next time. You can attempt the test again at a later
date. Just keep practicing! Some of the sections are harder for
Dachshunds than others, but many Dachshunds have earned their
Canine Good Citizen awards, and yours can, too. It’s a wonderful
and significant accomplishment, and the training will make your
Dachsie a better companion. Stick with your daily training sessions,
and remember: Patience is a virtue. After your Dachshund has his
CGC, why not aim even higher?
Showing Your Dachshund: 
Isn’t She Lovely!
Maybe you think you have the most beautiful Dachshund you’ve
ever seen (like the owner of the one in Figure 15-1). You may be
right! If your Dachshund is very close to the breed standard (see
Chapter 2) — especially if he has champions in his pedigree — he
may do well in and sincerely enjoy a conformation dog show.
A conformation dog show is a dog show in which a trained judge
analyzes each dog’s conformation to determine which dog most
closely matches the written breed standard. The dog the judge
deems closest to perfection should be the winner.
Show dogs can’t be spayed or neutered. The basic purpose of dog
shows is to evaluate breeding stock. The best breeding specimens
earn a championship, meaning they can put “Ch” before their regis-
tered names as a title. If your Dachshund is spayed or neutered, he
can’t compete in conformation shows unless they’re informal (and
non-title-earning) fun matches.
If you still want to pursue this exciting but extremely competitive
sport, your dog must be registered with a purebred dog registry like
the American Kennel Club (AKC) or the United Kennel Club (UKC).
You can find out more information about AKC conformation shows
at www.akc.org/events/conformation/index.cfm. For more
about UKC conformation shows, head to www.ukcdogs.com/

Shining in Obedience Competitions:
Surprise ’em All!
Maybe beauty contests aren’t your kind of thing. Or perhaps your
Dachshund doesn’t particularly like to sit still and look pretty. But if
he has a particular knack for basic obedience cues and you’re great
at teaching them (see Chapter 14), obedience competition or the
less-competitive sport called Rally may be for you. In Rally, dogs
and their handlers (that’s you) compete on a course designed by
the judge. The judge tells you where to start, and you and your
Dachshund move along at your own speed through 10 to 20 sta-
tions. Each station has instructions about what you have to do to
move on — such as stopping and sitting, doing a U-turn in a particu-
lar direction, weaving around cones or posts, having the dog stay
while you walk around him in a circle, even jumping over hurdles.
You can talk to your dog all you want to try to motivate him to do
the right thing. It’s fun!
At a Rally trial, your dog has the potential to win honors for first,
second, third, fourth, and qualifying prizes, and he can also earn

titles: Rally Novice (RN), Rally Advanced (RA), Rally Excellent (RE),
Rally Advanced Excellent (RAE), and more. For more information on
the requirements for earning titles and all the rules and regulations
for Rally, look to www.akc.org/events/rally/index.cfm.
The point of more formal obedience trials is to show that your
Dachshund has learned how to be a well-mannered and useful
companion. But he must prove it in a much more competitive and
rigorous way than in either the Canine Good Citizen test or a Rally
trial. Advanced obedience work includes tests of tracking ability — 
a Dachshund specialty. (These tests are hard work, so both you and
your Dachshund should be in good shape.)
To attain an obedience title, your Dachshund must earn over half
the points in each specified exercise under three different judges
at licensed or member obedience trials. The titles you can earn in
obedience competition are as follows:
 Companion Dog (CD)
 Companion Dog Excellent (CDX)
 Utility Dog (UD)
 Utility Dog Excellent (UDX)
 Obedience Trial Champion (OTCh.)
 Tracking Dog (TD)
 Tracking Dog Excellent (TDX)
 Variable Surface Tracker (VST)
 Champion Tracker (CT)
To discover more about AKC obedience rules and for more infor-
mation on how to get started, look to www.akc.org/events/
obedience/index.cfm. For information on obedience through 
the UKC, head to www.ukcdogs.com/obedience.htm.
I also recommend that you attend an AKC- or UKC-sanctioned 
obedience competition to see how it works, or attend less-formal
obedience events sponsored by your local dog club.
Spayed or neutered dogs may participate in both Rally and obedi-
ence trials if they’re registered with the appropriate organization.
Some less-formal obedience events by local clubs may not require
any registration. However, puppies less than 6 months of age,
females in heat, and lame, deaf, or blind dogs may not compete.
Dogs that attack other dogs or appear dangerous or overly 
aggressive will be disqualified.

Canine Freestyle for Dramatic
Dachshunds
If your Dachshund is better at funny tricks and garnering apprecia-
tive applause than executing commands with extreme precision, 
and if you’re a music lover with a relative amount of natural grace,
the two of you may love to compete in canine freestyle — a wonder-
ful event that combines obedience moves with choreography. You
pick the song, you make up the moves, and then you and your
Dachshund perform for the crowd . . . and maybe even earn titles!
You should attend a few events to see what it’s all about. You 
also can find out more from the Canine Freestyle Federation
(www.canine-freestyle.org) and the World Canine Freestyle
Organization, Inc. (www.wordcaninefreestyle.org). Because 
you have the music in you!
Competing in Field Trials: 
A Dachshund’s Destiny
Dachshunds are one of only a handful of breeds eligible to 
participate in field trials. The purpose of field trials is to give breeds
designed for field work the opportunity to exercise their natural abil-
ities — their penchant for hunting, following a scent, and cornering
vermin.
Dachshund field trials are different from field trials for other 
dogs, like retrievers. Dachshunds are best at tracking small game
through dense brush and alerting hunters to the location of the
game. In a Dachsie field trial, you reenact this scenario under con-
trolled conditions (no wildlife gets hurt). Dachshund field trials are
based on Brace Beagle field trials, in which a pair, or brace, of dogs
track a rabbit.
Field trials usually are held in a fenced area so the Dachshunds
can’t escape or become lost. Some field trials divide the male and
female Dachshund competitions; others don’t. The following list
explains how the contest begins and ends:
1. A Field Marshall calls each brace to attention.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
196

2. Volunteer brush beaters scare up a rabbit, and whoever
sees the rabbit first shouts, “Tally Ho!”
3. After the rabbit has been spotted and has scurried away,
the Dachshunds are brought to the place where the rabbit
was spotted.
4. Each handler encourages his or her Dachshund to find the
line, or scent, of the rabbit.
5. As soon as the Dachshund catches the scent, the handler
releases the Dachshund; he or she must then stop giving
instructions but may follow the dog — behind the judges
only.
6. When the judges have seen enough to judge the
Dachshund’s ability to follow the scent with persistence
and enthusiasm, they ask the handler to pick up the dog.
The ultimate goal of field trials, beyond having a great time, is 
to earn enough points for the title Field Champion (FC). Versatile
Dachshunds that attain this title and are Champions of Record 
in conformation are considered dual champions. These same
Dachshunds that also earn an obedience championship are 
considered triple champions. (See the section at the end of this
chapter for more on versatility.)
If you’re interested, you should visit a field trial or two to see what
it’s all about. Ask the people running their Dachshunds how you can
train your Dachshund for competition. Usually, you’ll meet friendly
people and get plenty of great advice. To find a field trial in your 
area and to discover more about AKC field trials, check out this site:
www.akc.org/events/field_trials/dachshunds/index.cfm.
You also can call your local dog club for more info.
Chapter 15: Advanced Training and Competing for Fun 197
Tracking tests for sniff-happy hounds
If your Dachshund loves to follow a scent (and what Dachshund doesn’t?), consider
tracking. Tracking is a fun, addictive, outdoorsy sport, a sort of competitive form of
canine search and rescue. Your Dachshund can earn tracking titles, and you’ll have fun
watching him use his natural nasal abilities. For more information on AKC-sponsored
tracking events, check out www.akc.org/events/tracking/index.cfm.

Competing in Agility Trials: 
Poetry in Motion
Agility is hot these days because everyone loves to watch it. Who
can resist dogs jumping through hoops, running over teeter-totters,
and tunneling through chutes all on one fast-paced obstacle course?
The dogs can’t resist it, either. If your Dachshund is athletic and you
think he’d enjoy agility, consider training him for agility work. Many
local trainers offer agility classes because it’s just so fun.
Agility helps both you and your Dachshund stay in great shape. 
It’s also the perfect outlet for your little performer. Any dog may
participate in an agility trial, whether or not it’s registered or
spayed/neutered.
Some Dachshund owners may be nervous about training their
Dachshunds to do agility because of the jumping. Luckily, jumps are
adjusted for the height of the dog, so a healthy, athletic Dachshund
at his ideal weight should have no problem with the jumps. However,
if your Dachshund has had back problems before, or you believe that
he’s at risk for disk disease (see Chapter 17), stick to obedience or
another less stressful activity.
Dogs can earn a number of titles in agility competition, each more
difficult to achieve than the one before:
 Novice Agility (NA)
 Open Agility (OA)
 Agility Excellent (AX)
 Master Agility Excellent (MX)
 Master Agility Champion (MACH)
The obstacle course in an agility trial varies depending on the 
level of competition, but all levels include contact obstacles with
certain areas a dog must touch when going through. Dogs must
achieve the obstacle course in a set amount of time (also depending
on the level of competition) and must successfully maneuver on, in,
over, or through each obstacle. The following list details some of 
the obstacles used in agility events:
 The A-frame: Your Dachshund must go up one panel of the 
A-frame and go down the other panel after touching the contact
zone, in whatever direction the judge orders.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
198

 The dog walk: Your Dachshund must go up one ramp, cross 
a center section, and go down the other ramp after touching
both contact zones, in whatever order the judge specifies.
 The seesaw: Your Dachshund must ascend a plank, cause it 
to seesaw the other way, and then descend, waiting on the
opposite side to touch the ground before getting off — after
touching the contact zone, of course.
 The pause table: Your Dachshund must jump onto a table,
pause for five seconds in a Sit or Down position (according 
to what the judge decrees), and then dismount.
 The open tunnel: A flexible tube must be positioned so 
that your Dachshund can’t see the end of the tunnel when he
enters. He must go in one end of the tunnel (the one the judge
indicates), go through the tunnel, and come out the other side.
 The closed tunnel: This tunnel has a rigid entrance connected
to a soft chute. Your Dachshund must enter the tunnel and
exit through the chute.
 The weave poles: Your Dachshund must go between the first
two poles from right to left, move from left to right between the
next poles, move from right to left between the next poles,
and so on.
 The single bar jumps: Your Dachshund must jump over a set 
of bars without knocking off the top one, in the direction the
judge specifies.
 The panel jump: Your Dachshund must jump over a top board
without knocking it off, in the direction the judge specifies.
 Other single jumps: Courses can include other types of single
jumps for your Dachshund to jump over.
 The double bar jump: Your Dachshund must jump over two
top bars without knocking off either one, in whatever direction
the judge specifies.
 The triple bar jump: Your Dachshund must jump over three
bars of gradually increasing heights without knocking off any,
in whatever direction the judge specifies.
 The tire jump (or circle jump): Your Dachshund must jump
through a tire opening in the direction the judge specifies.
 The window jump: Your Dachshund must jump through 
a window opening in the direction the judge specifies.
 The broad jump: Your Dachshund must jump over a series of
obstacles of varying heights without touching them. He must
enter between marker poles placed near the front and exit
between marker poles placed near the back.

Agility is so much fun that it may become an every-weekend activity
for you and your Dachshund. Why not? Your Dachshund would
rather spend his weekends playing with you than doing just about
anything else. To find out more about AKC-sponsored agility events,
look to the following site: www.akc.org/events/agility/index.

club for agility information.
Competing in Earthdog 
Tests: Born to Burrow
Bottom line: Dachshunds love to dig. But you already know that. 
If yours is a digger extraordinaire, he may have the right stuff for
earthdog tests or den trials. Most Dachshunds do. Earthdog tests
are a lot of fun, and any AKC-registered Dachshund (or Terrier) 
6 months of age or older may participate, including spayed and
neutered dogs. Den trials are similar but sponsored by the
American Working Terrier Association (AWTA), or a local group.
Many Dachshunds need minimal training to excel in this sport — 
it’s in your Dachsie’s genes.
In an earthdog test, a den is set up by digging a trench and tunnel,
placing a 9-inch x 9-inch wood liner in the trench, and covering it
with earth. The tunnel and trench have certain twists and turns, as
required by the level of competition, and at the end of the tunnel
are bars separating a caged rat from the dog (don’t worry, the rat
doesn’t get hurt). The tunnel can be opened at the end so you can
lift your Dachshund out when he’s finished. Tunnels for the higher
levels of competition have false exits, false entrances, and false
scented dens.
To start the competition, your Dachshund is released and must
enter the specially constructed tunnel, following it through to the
end where the rat is caged. He must bark or scratch at the cage, or
work the quarry, for a specified amount of time.
Beginners can start out with the Introduction to Quarry test 
(not required for more advanced levels of competition). This test
requires that your dog get to the rat within two minutes and work
the quarry continuously for at least 30 seconds. This test can help
you determine whether your Dachshund is a natural at earthdog
tests.
Part III: The Obedient Dachshund (Not an Oxymoron) 
200

More advanced levels of competition and titles are as follows:
 Junior Earthdog (JE): For this test, you must release your
Dachshund 10 feet from the den entrance. He has 30 seconds
to reach the rat from the time he’s released, and then he must
work the quarry, staying within 12 inches of it, continuously
for 30 seconds. Tunnels for this level of competition are 30
feet long with three 90-degree turns.
 Senior Earthdog (SE): For this test, you must release your
Dachshund 20 feet from the den entrance. He has 90 seconds
to reach the quarry from the time he’s released, and he must
work the quarry continuously for 90 seconds. Tunnels for this
level of competition are 30 feet long with three 90-degree
turns, but they also include a 7-foot false exit and a false den
consisting of a 4-foot side tunnel with no exit and a heavily
scented bedding area with no rat.
 Master Earthdog (ME): For this test, two dogs work together.
You must release your dog a specified distance from the real
den entrance. However, the den entrance is blocked, and a
false den entrance is available, so part of the test is to see if
your dog can find the real den entrance and bark to be let in.
Dogs that bark at the false den don’t qualify for this title. The
first dog to reach the real den is temporarily removed so the
second dog can have a chance to find it, too.
The first dog is then allowed in the tunnel and must reach the
quarry within 90 seconds and work the quarry for 90 seconds.
While the dog is working the quarry, the judge simulates dig-
ging sounds on the top of the den with a piece of wood for 30
seconds; the dog shouldn’t be distracted by this noise. The first
dog is then removed, and the second dog is given his turn.
The tunnel for this test is the same as the tunnel for the
Senior test except for the blocked entrance. A 20-foot scent
line leads to the entrance, and the false entrance is placed
somewhere along the scent line. Also, within the tunnel is an
18-inch section that narrows to a 6-inch passageway, and the
tunnel contains a suspended PVC pipe obstacle, 6 inches in
diameter, with 9 inches on each side of the pipe’s center line.

Becoming a Versatile Dachshund
Dachshund breeders, like many other breeders, are becoming
increasingly insistent that Dachshunds be beautiful and healthy,
show stoppers and athletes, and always able to perform the func-
tions for which they were originally bred. In an attempt to encour-
age versatility rather than overspecialization, the Dachshund Club
of America has established a versatility program that awards 
a Versatility Certificate (VC) to Dachshunds that distinguish 
themselves in several areas.
To earn a VC, a Dachshund must have 18 or more VC points obtained
from a conformation show and at least three of the following five
groups:
 Field trials
 Obedience (including the Canine Good Citizen award, which 
is a requirement for a VC certificate and equals one point)
 Rally
 Agility
 Earthdog or den trials
 Tracking
Depending on the titles or points earned in each group, a Dachshund
earns varying numbers of VC points. A triple champion (champi-
onships in conformation, field trials, and obedience) automatically
qualifies for a VC.
A Versatility Certificate is a great accomplishment. It encourages
well-rounded Dachshunds, and the hope is that breeders will avoid
breeding just for looks, field abilities, or obedience skill. The more
wide-ranging a dog’s abilities, the healthier and stronger he tends
to be. Plus, a Dachshund with a variety of important jobs is a busy,
happy, challenged Dachshund.

different areas, check out www.dachshund-dca.org/Media/

Your Dachshund is the very picture of health. You find it difficult
to imagine that your bouncing bundle of energy could ever get
sick or injured. However, it’s precisely when animals (and people)
are at their healthiest that preventive measures are most effective.
To keep your Dachshund puppy or dog in glowing health, from the
tip of her nose all the way to the tip of her tail (and that’s quite a
haul, as dogs go!), read this chapter. Here, you find out how to follow
a few basic preventive health measures.
Beyond prevention, the most important thing to take away from 
this chapter is this: Pay attention! The people who know your
Dachshund best are you, your family, and your vet. Always remain
vigilant for signs that something isn’t right. Changes in behavior,
appetite, sleeping habits, water consumption, or movement may be
signs of a health problem. Bumps, lumps, dry patches, bare patches,
and other irregularities you detect during your daily grooming 
examination may also signal a problem. Never hesitate to ask your
vet about your Dachshund’s condition. The sooner you catch 
a problem, the easier it will be to resolve.
Keeping Your Puppy (Or 
Older Dachsie) Healthy
Puppies are vulnerable. They look it when first born, too, but after
they fill out a little and commandeer entire households, bending
each helpless human to their will, they may not seem so helpless.

But regardless of how sturdy and authoritative they look and seem,
Dachshund puppies can easily fall prey to a number of serious, even
life-threatening, diseases. While nursing, they receive immunities
from their mothers, but after weaning, this immune protection drops
off quickly. Until they develop their own immune systems, they’re
particularly susceptible to the most serious contagious diseases.
Puppies can also develop nasty parasite problems, suffer from 
a lack of good grooming, and fall victim to ruptured disks in their
back (although disk problems are more common a few years down
the road; see Chapter 17). How do you keep your puppy healthy?
By taking a few simple measures, which I outline in the following
sections.
Vaccinations
Vaccinations protect your puppy from canine parvovirus, 
distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, and rabies, as well as diseases
that may be more prevalent in your area (such as coronavirus and
Lyme disease). One of the most important things you can do to keep
your puppy healthy is to get her vaccinated first at 5 to 6 weeks 
of age. If you buy your Dachshund from a breeder (see Chapter 4),
she should’ve had the first one or two vaccinations done already.
Continue to vaccinate your puppy according to the regular schedule
suggested by your veterinarian. Different vets will recommend cer-
tain vaccinations at certain stages, so talk to your vet about when
your puppy needs which vaccines.
Canine parvovirus is a highly contagious viral disease that comes 
in a diarrheal form and a cardiac form. If not treated, it’s usually
fatal — especially for puppies. Distemper is another highly conta-
gious and often fatal viral disease that causes severe neurological
damage in its advanced stages. Hepatitis is a highly contagious
virus that begins with a fever and can end in coma and death.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can cause death or severe
kidney, liver, and digestive tract damage. It can also be transmitted
to humans, along with rabies.
A debate is ongoing about vaccinations. Many people claim that
pets are overvaccinated and that some of the vaccines from the
first year last longer than vets previously thought. That could be.
Others claim that serious diseases can result from vaccinations.
That may also be true, especially with vaccinations of older dogs.
But for puppies, that first year’s vaccination schedule is crucial.
You can talk to your vet about how often your dog needs booster
shots after the first year, and you can work out a schedule of less-
frequent vaccinations later, but please don’t neglect these initial
vaccinations.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
206

The one vaccine required by law is the rabies vaccine, so even if
you’re anti-vaccine, you’re required to have proof of this one. You
must show this proof to license your dog, board her in a kennel, and
sometimes even to get veterinary care. Nobody wants to risk rabies,
so be diligent about the rabies vaccine. Many places, like boarding
kennels, doggy daycare, and even dog parks, require proof of other
vaccinations, too. Unless your dog has a serious health problem and
your vet advises against the vaccines, there really is no reason to
ignore the first year of vaccinations.
That’s not to say that vaccinations don’t involve risk. In rare cases,
animals react adversely to vaccinations. The most serious reaction,
an anaphylactic reaction, usually occurs in the first 15 to 60 min-
utes. This can lead to sudden cardiac arrest, so keep a close eye on
your puppy for the first hour after a vaccination. Other less-severe
reactions can happen later, from general fatigue, discomfort, and
loss of appetite to a local infection at the site of the vaccination.
The chances your Dachshund will have a reaction are extremely
slim, though, and most vets agree that the benefits of vaccination
far outweigh the risks. But always watch your Dachshund carefully
for a week or so after vaccines. If your Dachshund changes her
behavior or gets ill in any way following a vaccination, call your 
vet immediately.
Some people suggest that puppies should never be around other
dogs until all vaccinations are complete. But what about puppy
obedience classes? If you bring your puppy to obedience classes 
at 3 or 4 months of age, be sure to choose a class that requires 
all puppy owners to show proof of vaccination. You should be
okay. Better to have a well-trained puppy and take the very small
risk that something may get passed around. Not training or social-
izing your puppy is a bigger risk because you’ll be more likely to
give your Dachshund away when she gets to be too much trouble.
Besides, your Dachshund will already have a few rounds of vacci-
nations under her belt, and she’s already working on building up
her natural immunity — now she can build up her good manners!
Sterilization: Spaying or neutering
your Dachshund
Do you want to become a Dachshund breeder? Are you ready to
devote most of your waking hours to the intense and often heart-
breaking efforts of breeding, whelping, and raising, as well as study-
ing to improve the health and temperament of Dachshunds? Are you
ready to barely break even when you sell the puppies, to take back
any puppy for any reason, to remain committed to every dog out of
Chapter 16: Healthy Dachshund 101 207

litter after litter, and to watch puppies fail to thrive and die in your
arms?
If not, please sterilize your Dachshund. We are in the midst of a crisis
in this country. Pet overpopulation is out of control, and the number
of animals euthanized each year is staggering and saddening.
According to Spay USA (www.spayusa.org), every day 10,000
humans are born in the United States. In the same time frame, 70,000
puppies and kittens are born.
The fact is, Dachshunds like to run, dig, and escape. Even under
the best of conditions, your Dachshund could get free. If a female
does, she could easily come home pregnant. If a male does, he
could easily impregnate the neighbor’s champion Shih Tzu. You
could end up with a litter of unwanted puppies on your hands —
how will you find homes for them? At worst, your neighbor could
take you to court.
Sterilization doesn’t cost much. In fact, many humane societies
offer vouchers to make the procedure even cheaper; give your 
local society a call. Sterilization also is very safe for dogs. There’s a
slight risk to any dog that undergoes general anesthesia, but almost
all dogs come out of it just fine. Sterilization can even improve the
behavior of dogs, and health benefits come with early sterilization
(such as a reduced incidence of mammary tumors and fewer
prostate problems).
I can’t think of any reason why you wouldn’t want to sterilize your
Dachshund, unless you specifically bought a specimen to serve as
the foundation of a breeding program. In this case, you’ve made the
full-fledged commitment to be the best breeder you can be. But that
is the subject of another book.
Pest control
No matter where you live, and no matter how often you keep your
Dachshund inside, your pup probably will have some contact with
some kind of pest. Fleas are everywhere, for instance, and in the
southern states and parts of California, fleas have established a
comfortable and prolific year-round existence.
Ticks are everywhere, too, in the wooded areas of most states.
Lyme disease — a serious and sometimes fatal disease spread by
the deer tick — has been detected in 47 of 50 states. People can
catch it, too, and become seriously debilitated by it. Many puppies,
no matter how well they’re bred, are born with intestinal worms,
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
208

and Dachshunds can easily pick up worms at any time during their
lives. Mites that infect the ears or the skin abound, causing mange
and other painful skin problems. Heartworms, dastardly critters,
can kill your Dachshund by taking up residence in her blood ves-
sels, lungs, or heart after transmission from a single mosquito bite.
In other words, pest control is something every pet owner must
deal with. Pests come in many forms, and none of them are any fun.
But each of them can be dealt with easily, as long as you practice
a little prevention and address any pest problem as soon as you
detect it:
 Fleas: Fleas are uncomfortable for your Dachshund and can
cause complications ranging from severe allergic reactions to
tapeworms. You probably won’t be too fond of fleas jumping on
and off your arms and legs either, and if your Dachshund isn’t
close by, the fleas will be happy to bite you. In rare cases, fleas
can even infect humans with bubonic plague. Yikes!
Flea solutions: Prevention is the best solution. Apply a 
spot-on adulticide flea treatment (ask your vet for a recom-
mendation) every month during flea season. A few drops
between your dog’s shoulder blades will kill the fleas that 
land on your Dachshund, even before they have a chance 
to bite (see Figure 16-1). You can also treat your dog with an
oral insect-growth-regulator treatment once a month all year
round. Any flea that does bite your dog won’t be able to hatch
any eggs, and the flea reproduction cycle will be halted before
it can start. Leading parasitologists are recommending the oral
protein Lufenuron as the core to flea control with topical to kill
adult fleas if you see them, due to the inevitable resistance
fleas are developing to topical agents.
Ask your vet which flea products are best for your Dachshund.
And don’t forget a thorough vacuuming around the house,
along with washing your dog’s bedding in hot water — if you
see any fleas. This combined approach should take care of the
problem pretty quickly.
 Ticks: Ticks can pass on severe diseases. The notorious Lyme
disease is just one of many. Ticks are always dangerous when
you walk with your Dachshund in wooded areas. They range
in size, but sometimes the very smallest, barely visible ticks
are the most dangerous.
Tick solutions: Please don’t try to burn off ticks or yank them
out carelessly with your bare hands. You could injure your dog
or cause an infection if tick parts get left under the skin; you
could even infect yourself if the tick bursts and the blood gets
Chapter 16: Healthy Dachshund 101 209

on you. Instead, use a spot-on product made to kill ticks if 
you go out in tick-infested areas with your Dachshund. If your
Dachshund does get a tick and you find it during your daily
grooming session, pull it straight out slowly with tweezers 
or with your fingers (wear rubber gloves or use a tissue). If
your Dachshund shows signs of listlessness, fatigue, and loss
of appetite, Lyme disease could be the culprit. See your vet
right away.
 Worms: Roundworms, tapeworms, hookworms, and whip-
worms can cause a variety of symptoms, ranging from diarrhea
and vomiting to weight loss, severe fatigue, pneumonia, and
even death. If you aren’t thinking “Yuck!” at the very thought 
of worms, read on. Roundworms look like thin spaghetti, curled
in your dog’s feces. Tapeworms look like 1⁄4- to 1⁄2-inch wiggly 
segments in your dog’s poop or on the skin or hair around the
rectum. Hookworms penetrate your Dachshund’s skin, and the
eggs can be detected under a microscope in your Dachshund’s
feces. Whipworms look like 1-inch threads.
Figure 16-1: A few drops of treatment between the shoulder blades should keep
fleas away.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
210

Worm solutions: Have every new puppy you adopt dewormed,
usually a few times. In many cases, good breeders have this
done for new pet owners. Have your vet check fecal samples 
a few times because worms can shed eggs intermittently, so a
negative sample doesn’t always mean your puppy doesn’t have
intestinal worms. To prevent reinfection, always keep your yard
free of dog feces, and keep your Dachshund from sniffing poop
from other dogs on walks. Many worms are transmitted when
your Dachshund eats, or even sniffs, the feces of another dog
(including your own dogs). A fence will help to keep stray
dogs and their remains out of your yard. Once or twice a year
throughout your Dachshund’s life, continue to have your vet
do a fecal examination to check for the ongoing presence or
arrival of worms.
 Mites: Mites cause severe itching and a variety of unpleasant
and unattractive skin conditions — sometimes referred to col-
lectively as mange. Some mites infect your Dachshund’s ears;
others live in her skin. Suspect ear mites if your Dachshund
shakes her head a lot and scratches at her ears. Dark earwax
is another sign.
Scabies is a skin condition caused by a mite, and humans can
get it, too. Scabies itches and often results in hair loss. Chiggers
are tiny, red mites that live in wooded areas and burrow under
your dog’s skin, causing itching and redness. Other types of
mites cause puppy dandruff, mild itching, and hair loss, and
some live in the hair follicles and infects them.
Mite solutions: See your vet to acquire various types of
creams, drops, dips, or shampoos, depending on the type of
mite he finds. And don’t wait. Your Dachshund won’t enjoy
being bald and itchy.
 Heartworms: Heartworms are transmitted from mosquitoes
and, if left untreated, will kill your Dachshund. They travel 
to your dog’s heart and mature there, reaching lengths of up
to 12 inches. A dog with heartworms can be treated (the treat-
ment isn’t cheap), but if the heartworms are too advanced, 
it may be too late.
Heartworm solutions: First and foremost, prevent, prevent,
prevent. Give your Dachshund a heartworm pill on schedule
every single month, all year round — or always during mos-
quito season — for her entire life. Even if your Dachshund
doesn’t go outside for very long, she can still get a mosquito
bite. In fact, indoor-only Dachshunds have contracted heart-
worm from mosquitoes that got in the house. Also, avoid 
mosquito-infested areas whenever possible; use a product
designed to repel mosquitoes on dogs when you must. 
(Don’t use your human bug spray on your dog, however.)
Chapter 16: Healthy Dachshund 101 211

Heartworm pills are great for preventing heartworms, but 
if your Dachshund already has heartworms, a heartworm pill
could be fatal. Always have your Dachshund tested for heart-
worms before beginning heartworm pills. Most vets recommend
a yearly test just before mosquito season. Never neglect this
yearly test because an extra year or two carrying around 
a heartworm population could make a big difference in how 
treatable the problem will be.
Practicing Good Grooming
Keeping your Dachshund well-groomed is an important part of
maintaining her overall health, for the following reasons:
 A healthy, mat-free coat makes examination of the skin easier
and doesn’t harbor pests, dirt, or bacteria.
 Tartar-free and plaque-free teeth aren’t susceptible to gum
disease. Brushing also prevents more serious conditions like
heart disease, which can result from bacteria in your dog’s
mouth traveling to her heart.
 Short, clipped nails keep your Dachshund’s feet healthy 
and correctly positioned on the ground. They also keep your
Dachshund from sliding on slick surfaces, which could possibly
injure her back.
 Clean ears are less likely to harbor mites and develop infec-
tions. Regular ear examinations help you detect the presence
of such conditions if they occur.
 Emptied anal sacs don’t become impacted or infected.
Grooming can become part of a daily or weekly routine, and it’s 
a good idea to start grooming your puppy the very first day you
bring him home. Your grooming session will differ depending on
your dog’s age and coat, but a regular grooming routine will usually
go something like this:
1. Tell your Dachshund “It’s grooming time” and bring him
to the grooming spot.
Good choices are the bathroom countertop, the back
porch, or a table in a room that can stand a little
Dachshund hair.
2. Gently massage your Dachshund from head to toe, 
feeling for any lumps, bumps, or irregularities.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
212

If you do this task every day, you’ll catch any changes 
as soon as they occur. And don’t forget to examine your
Dachshund’s coat and skin for changes.
3. Pick up each foot and wiggle each toe, feel the footpads,
and then gently examine and rub each ear.
These typically are sensitive areas, and if your Dachshund
is used to having them touched, he’ll be much easier for
your vet to handle.
4. If your Dachshund’s nails need clipping, clip them.
Regularly clipping off the tips of your dog’s nails shouldn’t
be a problem after your puppy gets used to it. On your very
first vet visit, ask your vet to show you how to clip your
Dachshund’s nails so you can do it yourself. It doesn’t hurt
as long as you don’t cut down too far.
Your vet can show you how to avoid cutting the quick,
or the small vein in your dog’s nail. When nails are clipped
frequently (about once every two to four weeks — less often
if your dog walks on cement frequently), the quick retracts
somewhat and you don’t have to worry as much about 
cutting it. If you’re lax in your clipping duties, though, the
quick tends to extend closer to the tip of the nail. If you do
clip the quick, your dog may yelp, and you’ll have to stop
the bleeding. Keep a product on hand for that purpose
(many are available in pet stores).
5. Brush your dog’s coat with a soft-bristled dog brush. 
Add a once-over with a steel comb for longhaired and
wirehaired Dachshunds
Check for any sign of parasites as you brush, and work 
out any tangles with the comb.
6. Brush your dog’s teeth.
7. Apply a pest-control product if it’s time (see the section
on controlling pests in this chapter).
8. Praise your pup for behaving so well!
All dogs have anal sacs on either side of the anus, and these 
sacs are probably responsible for scent identification between
dogs, along with uses in courtship and/or marking territory. The
anal sacs fill up with a thick, extremely smelly liquid that’s usually
drained when dogs excrete feces.
Chapter 16: Healthy Dachshund 101 213

However, some “lucky” breeds — including many of the small breeds
and the beloved Dachshund — tend to develop impacted anal sacs.
Have you seen your Dachshund dragging her rear end around on
your carpet? That’s your first clue.
Your vet can drain the anal sacs, as can your groomer (if you ask
really nicely). Depending on how often your Dachshund’s sacs get
impacted, this procedure should be done every six to eight weeks.
Having someone else do it can get expensive if you’re on a tight
budget, though, so you can do it yourself — although I don’t recom-
mend it if you’re squeamish. If the anal sacs become impacted often
or abscessed more than once, a vet can surgically remove them.
Getting Regular Exercise: Move 
It or Lose It!
Every living thing with muscles needs to exercise. Exercise 
helps keep your Dachshund young, strong, and slim. Couch potato
Dachshunds may be more prone to disk problems (see Chapter 17),
less able to fight off disease, and generally less healthy than their
more athletic counterparts.
How much should your Dachshund weigh? That depends on her 
size (Standard or Miniature), muscle mass, and other factors. In gen-
eral, however, you can tell whether your Dachshund is too fat by
checking periodically (your daily grooming session is the perfect 
opportunity) for the following:
 Look at your Dachshund from the side. Do you see a nice 
tuck where her tummy is, or does her tummy hang down? If it
hangs down, she’s too fat. If her belly looks overly bloated, she
could have worms, so check with your vet before putting her
on a diet.
 Look at your Dachshund from the top (see Figure 16-2).
She should look more like a squash than a sausage. Her body
should get narrower between the back of the rib cage and the
hips. A too-sharp narrowing, however, could signal that your
Dachshund is underweight.
 Feel your Dachshund’s ribs. Can you feel the individual ribs
under a thin but slightly padded layer of skin? Just right. If you
can’t find any sign of ribs, however, your Dachshund is too fat.
If the ribs are very visible without even touching them, your
Dachshund may be too thin.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
214

Figure 16-2: An overweight Dachshund looks more like a jumbo frank than 
a regular wiener.
 Feel your Dachshund’s ribs. Can you feel the individual ribs
under a thin but slightly padded layer of skin? Just right. If you
can’t find any sign of ribs, however, your Dachshund is too fat.
If the ribs are very visible without even touching them, your
Dachshund may be too thin.
Exercise is crucial for overweight Dachshunds. However, if your
Dachshund is overweight, don’t begin a rigorous exercise program
right away. That extra weight puts a strain on her back, as well as 
on all her muscles. She needs to build up strength before she can 
do too much, just like an out-of-shape human. Start with slow, short
walks and watch for signs of excessive fatigue, such as heavy pant-
ing or sitting down and refusing to move. (You can bet a Dachshund
will make her wishes clear!)
If you suspect that your Dachshund is over- or underweight, 
also check with your vet to rule out a health problem (such as 
a thyroid or digestive issue) and formulate a plan of action. A new
diet, new feeding habits, or simply a decrease in treats and table
scraps will probably be the prescription (see Chapter 8). Certainly,
Overweight
Normal
Chapter 16: Healthy Dachshund 101 215

the second part of the prescription — especially if your Dachshund
is overweight — will be an increase in her level of exercise.
But what if you have trouble getting off the couch yourself? How
are you supposed to get your Dachshund to exercise? Following
are some tips:
 A daily walk is good for you and your Dachshund. It doesn’t
have to be fast. Remember, your Dachshund’s legs are a lot
shorter than yours, so she gets far more steps per block than
you do. It doesn’t have to be long, either. A spin around the
block in the morning and, ideally, in the evening is all it takes.
 Going on an errand? Walking down to the neighbor’s house
to borrow a cup of sugar or a power saw? Taking the kids to
the park? Take your Dachshund along. The more opportuni-
ties she gets to move — even for short periods at a time —
the better.
 If you have a fenced-in yard, let your Dachshund spend 
time out there each day to romp around. Go out with her and
throw balls, play chase, and work on tricks. If you just let her
out, she probably won’t get enough exercise on her own
(unless you have other dogs she can play with).
If you don’t have a fenced-in yard, look into installing a fence.
Dachshunds adore being outside without a leash, but it just
isn’t safe without a fence.
Dachshunds dig, so bury that fence a foot or so into the
ground, if possible. If not, stay outside with your Dachshund
or keep a close eye on her.
Training is hard, physical work for your Dachshund. Two or three
daily training sessions, without fail, serve as an excellent form of
exercise. See the chapters of Part III for much more on this topic.
Meditating on Holistic Health Care
When searching for the perfect vet, chances are you’ve encoun-
tered or at least heard about one or more holistic veterinarians in
your area. The movement toward more holistic and natural health
care is big right now — and nowhere more so than in the world of
animal companions.
Holistic veterinarians may practice any or all of a number of differ-
ent holistic healing techniques (most specialize in one or two),
including homeopathy, herbalism, flower essences, acupuncture,
acupressure, pet massage of all types, nutritional therapy, even
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
216

chiropractic treatment, to name some of the more common 
methods.
Homeopathy works on the principle of like treats like — treating
symptoms by using very diluted substances that normally cause
those symptoms to put the system back into balance. Herbalism is
the use of herbs as medicine to balance the system. Flower essences
treat the emotional energies. Acupuncture is the application of nee-
dles to certain energy centers of the body to release blockages, and
acupressure is the application of pressure to those energy centers.
Pet massage helps loosen tight muscles and connective tissue.
Nutritional therapy involves improved diet and supplements to help
prevent and heal disease. Chiropractic treatment aligns the spinal
column and joints to free blocked energy.
Should you use a holistic veterinarian for your Dachshund? Some
Dachshund owners swear by holistic vets and would never take
their pets to a regular vet again. Others wouldn’t consider a holistic
healer for their Dachshunds. The decision is up to you and should
be based on your own personal inclinations and feelings about the
matter. If you use a holistic health practitioner yourself and you
think the methods make sense, your pet may benefit similarly. If
you don’t like the idea for yourself, you won’t feel comfortable
about taking your Dachshund to someone who works in a more
holistic mode.
Some of the strongest proponents and strongest detractors of
holistic health are among those whose Dachshunds have fallen
prey to canine intervertebral disk disease (see Chapter 17).
Testimonials abound about Dachshunds that regained the use of
their legs through holistic techniques after full paralysis. Others
argue that only mainstream medicine should handle such a severe,
acute medical event. Again, the choice is up to you. Go with your 
gut feeling and do what feels right.
The approach I recommend generally is a combination of the two
approaches, often called complementary health care. More and more
vets recommend this approach as well. Holistic healing is great for
preventive medicine, to keep the system healthy and balanced. 
It can also be, in my experience, highly effective for chronic condi-
tions, such as arthritis, degenerative joint diseases, and diabetes, 
for which mainstream medicine has no cure. I know people who
swear by pet acupuncture or herbalism, for example, and sincerely
believe it provided pain relief and a return of function for pets that
the mainstream medical establishment said couldn’t be helped.
Chapter 16: Healthy Dachshund 101 217

For acute conditions, serious injuries, and dangerous illnesses, 
however, I would be more likely to choose the allopathic, or main-
stream, conventional vet. Mainstream medicine in this country is
best in emergency situations and for curing life-threatening condi-
tions through surgery and other procedures requiring extensive skill
and training. However, the more vets learn, and the more they com-
bine their efforts, the more the lines blur. Someday there may be no
difference at all, and every vet may use all available methods for the
greater good of pet health.

Handling Dachshund 
Health Problems

 Debating paralysis and quality of life

I
n general, your Dachshund will probably stay pretty healthy
throughout most of his life. But every dog can fall prey to an
occasional health problem. In this book, I talk a lot about the falli-
ble Dachshund back. Maybe you have a Dachshund that’s already
suffering from disk disease, or maybe you’re a little nervous that
he could experience back trouble. You are right to worry a little, if
worrying will encourage you to take some precautionary measures.
Dachshunds do tend to have back problems, and prevention is
your best course of action.
Dachsies also tend to experience a few other health problems. Yours
probably won’t, but you’ll know what to look for, just in case, after
reading this chapter. Here, I discuss everything from back troubles
to paralysis to conditions and disorders your Dachshund may have
to deal with.
Why Good Backs Go Bad
The title “Why Good Backs Go Bad” is a bit of a misnomer, because
many Dachshunds don’t have good backs to start with. Dachshunds
are a chondrodystrophic breed (along with a handful of other breeds,
like Pekingese, Cocker Spaniels, and Basset Hounds). Any dog — or
any human, for that matter — could experience disk disease, but
because of the way they’re built and because of the nature of their

backbones, Dachshunds are particularly susceptible to canine
intervertebral disk disease (sometimes called IVDD or CIDD).
Canine intervertebral disk disease is a serious problem in
Dachshunds and other chondrodystrophic dogs. Dachshunds 
have a disproportionate skeletal structure. They’re unusually short
and unusually long, so their backs take on an unusual strain. In addi-
tion, their spinal disks are more prone to rupture and degeneration
than other breeds. The weakest part of the disks typically is the side
nearest the spinal cord. One sudden move, one sharp turn around a
corner, or one leap off a bed is sometimes all it takes to cause a disk
to rupture and leak — or, in severe cases, burst out of its covering,
putting pressure on and injuring the delicate spinal cord.
Approximately one in four Dachshunds experiences a disk 
problem — most between the ages of 3 and 7, with 4 being the 
most common age of onset. The following sections dig deeper into
Dachsie back issues and present some strategies for prevention.
Understanding your 
chondrodystrophic canine
Your Dachshund’s spinal column is made up of small bones 
called vertebrae that surround and protect the spinal cord (see
Figure 17-1). His spinal column consists of four primary sections:
the cervical spine, or neck area; the thoracic spine, or chest area;
the lumbar spine, or lower-back area; and the sacral spine, or
pelvic area.
The spinal cord is the information highway of the body, sending
messages from the body to the brain about what’s going on in the
environment and from the brain back to the body telling the body
what to do in response to the environment. In other words, the
spinal cord is the link between what you think and what you do.
Without it, you can hear a car coming but you can’t jump out of 
the way. You can burn your hand but can’t remove it from the 
heat source. You can see something you want but can’t go get it.
Fortunately, spinal columns are very good protectors most of the
time. In addition to the hard, bony vertebrae, fibrous, fluid-filled
cushions in between each vertebra protect the spinal cord. These
cushions are called disks. How do they do their job? They help the
spine move more easily. They also reduce shock to the spine and
spinal cord by absorbing the various jolts, jerks, twists, and turns
all living beings must occasionally experience.

Figure 17-1: The spinal column of a Dachshund.
In some instances, however, a jolt gets through to the spinal cord
and injures it or causes a vertebra or disk to break or rupture. A
ruptured disk is what happens in CIDD, and as soon as it happens,
every second counts. In Dachshunds, the lower spine, or lumbar
region, is the most susceptible to back injury. In fact, five single
disks are responsible for 99 percent of ruptures in Dachshunds.
Spinal cords can’t take much pressure. A ruptured disk that presses
on the cord can quickly cause lasting damage. If the spinal cord
can’t receive blood, oxygen, and glucose, it will eventually die. And 
if the spinal cord dies, information can’t move from the brain to the
body or back again.
If a disk herniates, or bulges out from between the vertebrae, 
the severity is classified into Type I and Type II:
 In a Type I herniation, the disk tears and the inner matter,
called the nucleus, leaks out. This type of herniation is most
common in chondrodystrophic breeds such as Dachshunds,
and it’s a medical emergency. The leaking nuclear material can
put damaging pressure on the spinal cord, and if the damage is
too severe, your Dachshund may become permanently para-
lyzed. Emergency surgery — preferably within the first 12
hours after the injury (and up to 24 hours after) — often is 
successful in restoring function, although it doesn’t come 
with a guarantee.
 Type II herniation is less severe. The disk develops small
tears that allow small amounts of nuclear material to escape,
causing the disk to bulge and press on the spinal cord. This

herniation can develop gradually and may be less obvious
until it becomes severe. It’s common in degenerating disks
and can lead to gradual paralysis. Type II can also be treated
surgically, but some people prefer to keep their pets confined
so the disk can heal itself. Type II ruptures typically manifest
as back pain and respond well to medical therapy and cage
rest, but they eventually recur.
Type II herniations can be dangerous for several reasons, 
however. Too much bulging can cut off nutrients to the spinal
column, causing it to die a slow but permanent death. Also, the
Dachshund’s body could interpret leaking nuclear material as a
foreign invader. In some dogs, the immune system will attack,
causing further damage to the spinal cord.
Preventing disk injury
Can you prevent CIDD in your Dachshund? Maybe. Some dogs will
probably get it no matter what. Others may have a tendency to get
it but won’t. Still others may have no tendency at all, so the first
and best method of prevention is to find a Dachshund that isn’t
prone to CIDD.
The problem is, no one can tell for sure which Dachshunds 
are prone and which ones will stay clear. Scientists do know that
CIDD is genetic, however, so a great prevention method is to pur-
chase a Dachshund with little or no CIDD in his family history. Ask 
a prospective breeder about the occurrence of CIDD in his or her
lines (see Chapter 4 to find a reputable breeder who will be honest).
Most seasoned and reputable breeders have experienced CIDD 
at some point, so be wary of a breeder who says he’s never seen 
it. You’re looking for honest answers. Any good breeder knows not
to breed a Dachshund with CIDD, but because the disease usually
shows up at around 4 years of age, a Dachshund could’ve been bred
several times before the disease manifests. The puppies of that dog,
of course, shouldn’t be bred.
Through hard work and careful planning, some breeders have virtu-
ally eliminated CIDD from their lines, and these are the ones to look
for. Your worst bets?
 A breeder who won’t show you the parents (maybe one or
both are paralyzed).
 A pet store, because many of these dogs are bred with no
thought to eliminating conditions like CIDD, and you don’t get
to see the parents.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
222

 A shelter or humane society, because you can’t possibly know
the Dachshund’s background.
That’s not to say you should never adopt a needy Dachshund from 
a shelter or humane society. You should, however, be aware that the
dog’s risk of developing CIDD may be higher than average (see
Chapter 5 for more on shelters).
Aside from choosing the right breeder, you can do a few more things
to prevent CIDD from crashing into your world:
 Choose a Dachshund that isn’t so dramatically short and
long. The longer the back, the more strained it will be by any
movement. An international humane organization called the
Council of Europe is encouraging European breeders to breed
for taller dogs with shorter backs. The Germans recently
revised their standard accordingly, and many breeders in the
United States are following suit — breeding for less extreme
dimensions in order to ensure healthier, stronger backs.
 Keep your Dachshund at a healthy weight. Obesity puts 
a huge strain on your Dachshund’s back (see Chapter 8).
 Keep your Dachshund from engaging in any sharp twisting
movements, jumping from high places, or running around
sharp turns. Avoid tricks that teach your Dachshund to beg
on his hind legs or do anything else that puts his spine in a
vertical position. Walks are great and exercise is great, but try
to keep your Dachshund’s back relatively straight when he’s
in motion (easier said than done, I know, but you must try).
Keep your Dachshund horizontal whenever possible, even when
picking him up. Place one hand under his chest and the other under
his abdomen or back legs. Lift him carefully, keeping him level, and
hold him in your arms with his spine parallel to the floor. Never 
hold your Dachshund vertically or let his back end swing from your
arms. Teach children in your household how to lift and hold your
Dachshund, too. However, younger children should never lift a
Dachshund and should play with your Dachsie only while sitting 
on the floor. (See Chapter 7 for more on teaching family members
how to live with a Dachsie.)
Treating Disk Disease
Sometimes, despite all the preventive measures in the world, a
Dachshund will suffer a disk herniation. If yours does, you must
know what to do, and you must do it fast. However, you can’t do
anything if you don’t know that your Dachshund is having a 
Chapter 17: Handling Dachshund Health Problems 223

problem in the first place. The following sections explain the signs
and what you can do to act.
Recognizing the warning signs
Dogs have high pain thresholds and an instinct not to reveal when
they’re in pain. After all, in the wild, the obviously injured animal is
the one that gets picked off by the predators. But if you pay atten-
tion, you can tell whether your Dachshund is in pain. Look for the
following signs:
 Shivering — especially when combined with unusual inactivity
 Refusal to get up and play, even for food
 A yelp when you pet your Dachshund or try to pick him up
 A pulled-in head, arched back, or any other strange position
 A refusal to bend down to the food or water dish to eat 
or drink
 Limping of any kind
 A “drunken” rear end, which moves but looks as if it isn’t 
completely under control
 Dragging of the back legs
Taking emergency measures
If your Dachshund shows any of the warning signs from the previous
section, call your vet immediately. In the case of dragging the back
legs or showing any other signs of paralysis or severe pain, drive
immediately to the vet’s office or nearest pet emergency facility.
Don’t wait. You can call on the way.
I’ve talked to people whose Dachshunds showed signs of trouble on
Friday but they decided to wait until Monday to act because their
vets’ offices were closed. Several of them now have paralyzed pets.
I’ve also talked to someone — a reader of the first edition of this
book, in fact — who took her Dachshund to the emergency vet clinic
on a Saturday, even though her regular vet was closed, just because
she read this chapter. Her Dachshund underwent surgery and now
has four fully functioning limbs!
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
224

In short, you have just hours to act. Immediate surgery on a
Dachshund with a Type I ruptured disk has a much better success
rate than a similar surgery on a human. For Dachshunds still feeling
pain (a good sign that the spinal cord is still functioning), the suc-
cess rate for restoring function is 95 percent. The success rate is 50
percent for Dachshunds experiencing total paralysis, as long as the
dog was feeling pain within the last 24 hours. But if you wait longer
than 24 hours after a disk injury, the success rate plummets to a
meager 5 percent. If that isn’t reason enough to rush your injured
Dachsie to treatment, nothing is.
Opting for surgery
Some Dachshund people are anti-surgery, but be advised: Most
vets agree that surgery is the quickest and safest route to recovery
in the case of a Type I disk herniation. It’s a pricey, sure. But many,
many Dachshund owners have paid that price and would do it
again if they had to. (And a few have done it again when their
Dachshunds had more than one disk herniation.)
Surgery is often, very often, successful — if done within 12 to 24
hours. Surgery has a much quicker recovery time than crate rest.
And because the pressure is immediately relieved on the spinal
cord, the real danger is over. Your vet still may call for a short period
of post-surgery crate rest, which you should observe. After that,
however, your Dachshund will probably be, for the most part, back
to normal.
Chapter 17: Handling Dachshund Health Problems 225
Save the leaves (er, your 
Dachsie’s mobility)!
Darryl E. McDonald, DVM — a veterinary neurosurgeon at the Dallas Veterinary
Surgical Center in Dallas, Texas — has performed hundreds of disk surgeries on
Dachshunds. He likes to describe the urgency of surgery with the following analogy:
“When a disk ruptures and damages the spinal cord, it is analagous to a houseplant
that has not been watered for three weeks. It loses half its leaves. So what do you
do? You water it! If you don’t, it will die. Similarly, surgery is needed to remove the
spinal cord pressure. The longer you wait, the more ‘leaves’ are lost and the less
likely your Dachshund will recover.”

Don’t be too quick to take your Dachshund running again, though.
Don’t ignore follow-up visits or the prescribed physical therapy.
Your vet or veterinary surgeon can show you what to do with your
Dachshund to help him regain his strength and the use of his legs.
Exercises are extremely important to help your Dachshund
recover.
The downsides to surgery, other than the high price tag, are the
risk to your Dachshund of enduring a general anesthetic (a small
but real risk) and the risk that the surgery won’t be successful 
(a very small risk when the surgery is performed by an experi-
enced, board-certified veterinary surgeon within 24 hours after the
injury). If surgery is unsuccessful, your Dachshund may be 
paralyzed anyway or may continue to suffer pain.
If your Dachshund needs back surgery, you can’t just take him to
your veterinarian’s office. The surgery is complicated and requires
the experienced hand of a veterinary neurosurgeon or a veterinary
surgeon with an emphasis in orthopedics. If you don’t have a veteri-
nary hospital in your area that specializes in back surgery — or 
at least one that has a surgeon with a lot of relevant experience —
check out your nearest school of veterinary medicine. Chances are,
the school will be associated with someone who’s experienced 
at back surgery in dogs. The better the surgeon, the better your
Dachshund’s chances at recovery. No matter the distance, it will 
be worth the trip.
Crate-and-wait
“Waaait a minute,” you may be thinking. “Just how much is this
surgery going to cost me?” That depends on where you live and
where you take your Dachshund, but the all-inclusive charges
probably will range from $800 to over $2,000 (most are probably
close to $1,500). For many Dachshund owners, surgery isn’t an
affordable option, so is surgery your only choice when your
Dachshund’s disks go bad?
No, although for severe episodes, it has the highest success rate —
by a long shot. The other option is the one used more frequently 
for Type II herniations (see the earlier section “Understanding your
chondrodystrophic canine”). In Dachshund circles, it’s known 
as crate-and-wait, or crate rest. Crate rest means confining your
Dachshund to his den for an extended period of time — usually
between two and four weeks. Three or four times per day, you take
your Dachshund out to relieve himself and then you immediately
return him to his den.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
226

At first, crate rest is easy. Your Dachshund is in pain, and he 
probably doesn’t want to move. But by the second or third day —
especially if your vet has prescribed steroids or pain medication —
your Dachshund is feeling a whole lot better and is getting mighty
tired of that den. He wants to get out! He’ll probably whine, cry,
scratch, dig at the sides, and do anything he can think of to convince
you to let him out.
Keeping your Dachsie confined won’t be easy, but it is essential. 
I repeat: essential. A medicated Dachshund is still extremely vulner-
able to spinal cord injury. That injured disk is still soft, still ruptured,
and perhaps still oozing nuclear material. Movement could cause
permanent damage, and if he isn’t feeling the pain due to medica-
tion, he’ll be much more likely to move in ways he shouldn’t. If you
don’t allow his spinal disks adequate healing time, he could easily
wind up losing the use of his back legs. Keeping him in the den, no
matter how much he begs (remember, you are in charge), gives him
a far better chance of a full and glorious recovery.
Physical therapy is great for Dachshunds recovering from surgery
and for post-crate-rest Dachshunds working to restore lost function.
Commonly prescribed activities include
 Swimming in the bathtub (never leave your Dachshund 
unsupervised because if his legs don’t work correctly when 
he needs them, he could drown)
 Towel walking, in which you hold up your dog’s rear end with
a towel sling draped under his abdomen
Chapter 17: Handling Dachshund Health Problems 227
Insuring your dachshund
Could pet insurance be for you? If you buy pet insurance for your Dachshund puppy
before he ever has any health problems and he develops disk disease, your foresight
could pay off in spades. But if you wait until your dog is full-grown and he has a disk
episode, it becomes a pre-existing condition, making it too late to get insurance that
would cover disk surgery. Of course, you hope that your dog won’t ever have a prob-
lem. I hope so, too! But pet insurance may be a smart bargain, just in case. And
even if your dog stays healthy, pet insurance could help offset the cost of regular
checkups and other health maintenance (depending on the kind of plan you choose).
Put Pet Insurance into an Internet search engine to compare various plans. And if
you register your purebred Dachshund with the American Kennel Club, you get a
free 60-day trial of pet insurance!

 Bicycling your Dachshund’s limbs to exercise his full range 
of motion
 Massaging the affected areas
Also check out a unique invention called the Bottom’s Up Leash
(www.bottomsupleash.com). This leash holds up a weak or para-
lyzed rear end so your Dachshund can still go on walks with you
while recuperating.
Preventive surgery: The debate
In some Dachshunds, back injury looks imminent. X-rays can reveal
calcifications to the spine that may indicate impending disk trouble.
For dogs with one or more parents that suffered, disk disease is
likely. And what about the Dachshund that has already suffered 
one episode? Do you want him to endure surgery a second time?
More and more often, veterinary surgeons are performing a 
preventive surgery called fenestration. This procedure essentially
drains the spinal disks of fluid to prevent any possible future hernia-
tion or rupture. Many vets agree that preventive fenestration can
not only prevent a first or second disk episode from occurring, but
also dramatically relieve the pain and discomfort of degenerating
disks as your Dachshund ages.
The surgery isn’t without risks, however. A surgery gone wrong can
injure a healthy spinal cord. Recovery can be painful, too.
However, a new, experimental technique called laser disk fenestration
shows great promise as a safer alternative with an easier recovery.
Be sure to talk to your doctors about this option.
Other complications include a reaction to the anesthesia or a post-
surgical infection, although these complications aren’t very common.
Your Dachshund could also suffer from arthritis later in life because
his disks won’t work to ease the friction between vertebrae.
In general, a normal, healthy Dachshund has no cause to undergo
preventive fenestration. It’s definitely something to consider, how-
ever, if your Dachshund is already undergoing surgery to prevent a
second incident. The surgeon would fenestrate the afflicted disk as
well as disks in the surrounding area. Or, if genetic or other factors
make rupture particularly likely, fenestration may be a good idea.
Your vet can help you evaluate the benefits and risks.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
228

Five specific disks account for about 99 percent of disk ruptures 
in Dachshunds, so these five are commonly fenestrated during 
surgery for a ruptured disk or as a preventive.
Living with Paralysis: 
Is It a Quality Life?
For some Dachshunds, no matter what preventive measures have
been taken, paralysis becomes an unfortunate reality. You love
your pet dearly. Does paralysis really necessitate euthanasia?
This is a question many Dachshund owners struggle with, and
strong opinions exist on both sides. A paraplegic Dachshund can
still get around, with some help, but also requires more care than 
a fully functional Dachshund. Are you up for it?
You may think you can’t put your Dachshund through it: the surgery,
the pain, the crate rest, the suffering, and so on. This is (arguably)
the least viable reason for having your Dachshund put down, how-
ever. Dogs don’t have all the complicated emotional associations we
do when it comes to pain and paralysis. If they can recover and live
free of pain, even if paralyzed, they’ll be perfectly happy — as long
as they can be with you.
Many, many people have chosen to live with their paralyzed
Dachsies and wouldn’t have it any other way. These dogs are still
capable of great love, affection, and good health apart from their
paralysis. Some paralyzed Dachsies even recover full or partial use
of their legs long after their owners had abandoned all hope that
they would ever walk again. Many other people, on the other hand,
have chosen euthanasia for their pets, for one reason or another —
the desire to avoid suffering for the pet or the owners, lack of knowl-
edge, inability to care for a paralyzed pet, and/or cost of the 
procedure, to name a few.
The choice, obviously, is up to you and your family. A paralyzed
Dachshund and his people must endure certain challenges, even
after the pain is gone. For example, he won’t have bladder or bowel
control and can be more susceptible to bladder infections, urine
scalding (getting burned by the acid urine), and pressure sores
from sitting in one place for a long time.
But remember, to a Dachshund, quality of life means a good meal, a
pat on the head, and you by his side. He doesn’t know to be embar-
rassed by lack of bladder control (although he will know something
is very wrong if you are constantly upset because of this or other
Chapter 17: Handling Dachshund Health Problems 229

associated conditions). He doesn’t care if he can’t walk across the
room to get his favorite ball. He’ll be perfectly happy to have you do
the fetching!
Of course, if your Dachshund continues to be in pain, euthanasia
may be the only humane option. But if the pain resolves, your
Dachshund, with your help, can find a way to have a perfectly satis-
factory, rewarding life. One Dachshund owner I know said it best: If
that Dachshund spirit returns, your dog is telling you he has quality
of life. Period. If you’re struggling with the euthanasia decision, let
your Dachshund tell you what to do and don’t listen to anyone else.
Sometimes, humans have awfully funny ideas about things.
Life with a paralyzed Dachsie is challenging but rewarding, some-
times heartbreaking, sometimes filled with joy, but always an adven-
ture. May you and your special Dachshund have many more happy
years together.
Can’t bear to look at that poor, pitiful dog with his legs dragging
behind him? Carts are available for paralyzed dogs, and these
wheeled contraptions allow paraplegic Dachshunds to get around
quite nicely. Your Dachshund doesn’t know the meaning of the word
pitiful. He’ll adapt, learning to pull himself with his front feet. 
Some tasks are more difficult, but what Dachshund isn’t up for 
a challenge?
Considering Other Dachsie 
Health Issues
Because I’ve spent most of this chapter on it, back problems 
obviously are a Dachshund’s number-one health concern. But
Dachshunds can develop a few other health issues, as well. The 
following sections tell you what symptoms to look for and what
warrants a call to the vet.
Bloat
Bloat, or gastric torsion, is an emergency condition that happens
most often to deep-chested breeds like Dachshunds. For unknown
reasons, the stomach fills with gas and then twists on itself. Without
treatment, bloat is fatal. If your Dachshund suddenly starts pacing,
salivating, and acting upset, nervous, or in pain — or it just seems
like something is very wrong — suspect bloat. Call your vet 
immediately. Emergency surgery could save your dog’s life.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
230

Some experts theorize that you can prevent bloat by keeping a dog
from eating too quickly or from drinking too much water right after
a meal. To reduce the chance of a bloat incident, some recommend
feeding two or three meals per day rather than one. This helps
your Dachshund to be less hungry and less likely to gulp down his
food. Preventing eating and drinking too fast immediately before or
after exercise may also help, although nobody knows for sure.
Canine epilepsy
Canine epilepsy, a seizure disorder, happens in some Dachshunds,
and nobody is sure why. If your Dachshund suddenly goes stiff,
starts shaking, or becomes completely non-responsive or totally
limp, suspect a seizure. Call your vet immediately. You can’t prevent
epilepsy, but it is treatable with medication.
Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is a thyroid gland disorder in which the thyroid
doesn’t secrete enough of its hormone, slowing a dog’s metabolism
and resulting in weight gain, fatigue, sluggish behavior, dry skin, hair
loss, and severe behavioral changes — ranging from aggression to
depression. If your Dachshund exhibits these symptoms, call your
vet for an appointment. Dachshunds, along with many other breeds,
are particularly prone to hypothyroidism. Most dogs develop the
disease in middle age. It can be successfully treated with a synthetic
thyroid hormone, just like humans with the same disease.
If you have a hypothyroid condition, you may be surprised to find
that your little Dachsie friend takes as much or more thyroid med-
ication than you do. Dachshunds need more than humans per
pound to manage their condition.
Progressive retinal atrophy
Some Dachshunds will develop progressive retinal atrophy, a degen-
erative eye disease that eventually results in blindness. The disease
isn’t painful and sometimes has no symptoms until the dog is almost
completely blind; however, some dogs will show reluctance to go
down stairs or go into dark areas (night blindness can be an initial
stage of the disease). In some dogs, the eye lens looks more opaque
or cloudy, but this isn’t always the case.
In particular, longhaired Miniature Dachshunds may be prone to
PRA. The good news is, a DNA test can pinpoint whether a Miniature
longhaired Dachshund is a carrier for PRA, so breeders who do this
Chapter 17: Handling Dachshund Health Problems 231

test should be able to make smarter breeding decisions. Be sure to
ask your breeder whether he or she tests breeding dogs for PRA.
If your breeder would like to know more about this new DNA test for
PRA, send him or her here: www.dachshund-dca.org/health.html.
After a dog develops progressive retinal atrophy, no treatment can
reverse it. However, blind dogs can live a happy life, with a little
extra care.
Allergies
Some Dachshunds have skin problems that a veterinarian will 
diagnose as allergies — possibly to environmental contacts and
inhalants or food. (Many pet owners think their pets have food
allergies, but true food allergies account for only about 5 percent
of allergic skin problems.) Allergies usually show up in the form of
rashes, itchy sores, and plenty of scratching. A switch to a higher
quality food with a single protein source (like lamb, fish, or veni-
son) helps some dogs — not only with food allergies but also with
lessening the severity of environmental contacts and inhalant aller-
gies. It also boosts overall health. Be sure to consult your vet if
your Dachsie shows symptoms.
A recent study suggests that Dachshunds may also be prone to 
vaccine-induced allergies. This ongoing study at Purdue University
is exploring the link. If your Dachshund seems to be having a reac-
tion after a vaccination, call your vet right away. For more informa-
tion and updates on this study, look here: www.dachshund-dca.

Enjoying Your Senior Dachsie
and Saying Goodbye
In This Chapter
 Defining “senior”
 Taking care of an older Dachsie
 Watching for illness during the golden years
 Coping with the loss of a pet
W
hether your Dachsie has been your best friend for years or
you’ve just adopted an older Dachshund, life with a senior
Dachsie isn’t exactly like life with a puppy. Your senior won’t have
quite the energy, the verve, or the capacity for destruction and
mischief. On the other hand, life with a senior Dachsie isn’t as differ-
ent as you may imagine. Some Dachsies act downright puppylike
until the end!
Aging Dachshunds have many of the same challenges as other aging
breeds — and a few unique challenges as well. You want your friend
to enjoy maximum longevity, of course. Knowing what’s to come and
taking a few precautionary measures now and later will help your
Dachshund enjoy a long, healthy, happy life. This chapter is here to
help. I also assist you in making the difficult euthanasia decision and
coping with your loss after you say goodbye.
At What Age Is a Dachsie 
a Golden Oldie?
Different breeds become seniors at different ages, so just when
should you consider your Dachshund a senior citizen? As you may
know, dog longevity is largely based on size. Small dogs often live 14
to 16 years or longer, whereas the bigger breeds often live only half

that long. Because Dachshunds are small, their longevity tends
toward the high side (lucky for us owners); as long as yours is
healthy, she will enjoy life to the fullest up until the very end.
But your Dachshund will begin to show signs of aging well before
her final day. Dachshund owners would be wise to pay special
attention to their pets’ health, behavior, and appetite starting some-
where around her 7th or 8th year. You can consider your 7-year-old
Dachsie middle-aged, and your 8-year-old is just entering her golden
years. This is the age when your Dachshund has fully matured and is
heading into the second half of her life. You may not have to do any-
thing different right away, but do pay attention. Your Dachshund’s
chances of getting age-related diseases are now increasing.
Don’t be alarmed if your Dachshund starts to sprout gray hair
around her 7th or 8th year. This is perfectly normal — it happens
to the best of us — and is no indication of ill health.
The five most common diseases of aging in dogs are kidney disease,
liver disease, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease — all conditions
common to humans, too. Many aging dogs also develop arthritis 
and canine dementia, a neurological disease similar to Alzheimer’s.
Ask your vet about the warning signs and symptoms for these 
age-related conditions so you can prepare and take action when
appropriate.
Addressing a Senior Dachshund’s
Care Needs
The good news is, when she has passed her 7th year of life, your
Dachshund’s chance of developing canine intervertebral disc 
disease (CIDD) decreases (see Chapter 17). The bad news is, her
chance of developing other conditions — such as kidney disease,
liver disease, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, cataracts,
progressive retinal atrophy, and dementia — increases. Fortunately,
many of these age-related conditions are treatable if caught in time.
Conditions like diabetes and liver and kidney disease often are, in
the early stages, detectable only through a blood test. When your
Dachshund starts showing symptoms, these diseases may be
advanced and far less treatable.
Cataract is a general term often used to describe the lens of the 
eye gradually becoming opaque. It actually describes two separate
conditions — one an age-related stiffening of the lens that causes 
a gradual loss of vision and a blue/white cloudiness deep in the eye.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
234

This form usually begins around age 8 and becomes more prominent
as the Dachshund gets older. It limits low-light vision but rarely
leads to total blindness or the need for surgical lens replacement.
True cataracts, however, are crystalline changes of the lens that
happen rapidly with very obvious white alterations deep in the
eye. This type can be associated with diabetes and can occur even
in young dogs. It often leads to blindness but can be reversed with 
surgical lens replacement.
To help prevent age-related health problems, you can take some
precautionary measures:
 Take your Dachshund to the vet for a checkup every six
months — or, at the very least, every year — after she turns 8
years old. Technically, you should take your pet to the vet once
a year anyway, but many people don’t bother if their pets seem
healthy. During the golden years, however, the regular vet visit
is particularly critical for dogs. Only a vet can detect the dis-
eases of aging that may not be readily apparent except through
blood, urine, and heart tests. Be sure to report to your vet any
changes in appetite, water consumption, bathroom habits, and
behavior — all of which could signal health problems.
If you aren’t already doing so, begin a Dachshund diary in
which you record all daily information about your Dachshund’s
habits and behavior. Record what she ate, how much she
drank, how much she exercised, what medications you gave
her, and how she behaved. How was her mood? Later, when
your vet asks you when certain changes first occurred, you’ll
be able to answer with authority.
 Be prepared for behavioral changes, and keep your
Dachshund’s routine as regular as possible. Older dogs tend
to become less flexible and more resentful about changes in
routine, because changes can be confusing. Feed, walk, and
take your Dachshund out at the same times each day. If your
Dachshund’s vision or hearing declines, be sure to keep furni-
ture and her food and water bowls in the same places so she
doesn’t get disoriented.
If you have an older longhaired or wirehaired Dachshund, don’t
yank at mats or strip hair too vigorously. Too much poking and
pulling can irritate your older dog. But don’t eliminate groom-
ing, either. Keep up the daily routine but be aware that your
Dachshund may be more sensitive. A gentle touch, please!
She’ll be comforted by the routine and your familiar touch.
Frequent touching also will keep your pet prepared for more
frequent vet visits and may alert you to skin or other changes.
Chapter 18: Enjoying Your Senior Dachshie and Saying Goodbye 235

 If your Dachshund shows no signs of slowing down, don’t
curb her exercise. If, on the other hand, she tires more easily
or seems to be in pain when exercising, check with your vet
and cut back on the length of your daily walks. But don’t cut
them out altogether unless your vet advises you to do so.
Older dogs need exercise to stay healthy and in good spirits.
Looking at the senior diet
When you browse the dog-food aisles of your local pet store or
supermarket, you probably notice dog foods targeted for senior
dogs. Does your aging Dachshund need a change in diet? As long
as her health is fine, your Dachshund can continue on her regular
diet for her entire life. In fact, switching your Dachshund’s diet
away from the food she thrives on can actually be detrimental.
Some senior formulas are low in protein, but older dogs with healthy
kidneys need protein in order to maintain muscle mass. Only dogs
with kidney problems need to limit their protein intake; don’t limit it
in your Dachshund’s diet just because she has reached middle age.
If your vet tells you to limit your Dachshund’s protein intake due 
to a specific health problem and recommends a senior diet, fine.
Otherwise, forget it.
Senior diets also are lower in calories and fat, which makes sense
because older dogs often are less active than younger dogs, and
because Dachshunds in particular are prone to obesity. An obese,
aging dog has a greater chance of developing certain problems. 
But you don’t need to switch to a senior diet to decrease your
Dachshund’s caloric intake if she has decreased her level of 
exercise. Simply feed her a little less or cut down on the treats.
Treats often are a real problem for older dogs because of how many
owners give them. A treat may be only 30 calories, but if your
Dachsie gets 10 a day, that’s 300 extra calories she takes in a day.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
236
What happens to your senior at the vet?
During a typical geriatric veterinary visit, your vet tests your Dachshund’s kidney
and liver function, blood sugar level, hematacrit, and protein level. Your Dachshund
may receive an electrocardiogram, and the vet will check for changes in weight;
look for lumps, bumps, and skin problems; ask you about your Dachshund’s appetite
and behavior; and take some blood.

The bottom line when it comes to diet is that your healthy senior
Dachsie is no different from the 4-year-old Dachsie down the street.
Keep all things about your aging Dachshund’s life the same unless
your vet instructs you to do otherwise.
Remembering that old 
shouldn’t equal lazy
An aging Dachshund may not be able to get around quite as 
quickly or spryly as she once did, but that doesn’t mean she won’t, 
or shouldn’t, try. Old dogs need to keep moving. If they don’t, they
will experience diminished muscle tone. Moderate exercise helps
keep arthritis symptoms in check and helps a Dachsie keep her
weight down.
Arthritis is common in older dogs, and if your Dachshund has
experienced fenestration of her spinal column during disc surgery
(see Chapter 17), she may, upon aging, suffer some arthritis in her
spine. Some Dachshunds also develop arthritis in their hips, shoul-
ders, and/or leg joints. See your vet if your Dachshund appears to
be in pain.
And note that although exercise shouldn’t be so vigorous that it
causes your Dachshund discomfort, exercise is essential to keep
arthritis symptoms at bay. In the advanced stages, your Dachshund
may need to cease strenuous activity. Always follow your vet’s 
guidance.
Your older Dachshund may not show a single sign of slowing down.
Age isn’t a disease. If your 10-year-old Dachsie races from room to
room when you say “Walk?” and still scuttles eagerly through the
park sniffing for squirrels, let her go for it! Dogs have a pretty good
sense, in general, of how much movement they need and how much
they can handle. Unless your dog has become lazy (because you
haven’t kept her on a regular exercise schedule), her instincts
should be sharp you can usually trust them. When it comes 
to exercise, age alone should have no bearing on how much your
Dachshund can do.
Recognizing When Problems 
Aren’t Just “Old Age”
It’s easy to assume that if your senior dog is slowing down, 
becoming confused, or even occasionally yelping in pain, she’s
Chapter 18: Enjoying Your Senior Dachshie and Saying Goodbye 237

simply experiencing symptoms due to old age. Aging, however,
isn’t a disease. If your Dachshund displays any of the following
signs or symptoms, contact your vet right away, because it isn’t
just old age if your pet
 Acts confused. This could be a sign of dementia — something
dogs can develop just like people. Canine dementia is treatable.
 Yelps in pain. This could be a sign of arthritis, disc disease,
an injury, or any number of other maladies.
 Loses her appetite or drastically increases her appetite 
for more than a day or two. Appetite changes could signal
hypothyroidism (see Chapter 17), liver disease, kidney dis-
ease, depression (itself a symptom of possible illness), or
something else.
 Suddenly increases her intake of water. Diabetes or kidney
disease could be the culprit. Trouble urinating or excessive
urination is a related warning sign. Increased water intake 
can also be a signal of other health problems that your vet
can identify.
 Quickly gains or loses weight. Weight gain or loss — espe-
cially if you can’t trace it directly to food intake — is a warning
sign. Hypo- or hyperthyroidism could be the culprit, but weight
changes can be a signal of many other problems, too.
 Is excessively irritable. If your once-placid Dachshund is 
suddenly growling, nipping, biting, snarling, or bearing her
teeth, she could be suffering from pain, confusion, dementia,
or a combination of ailments.
Losing and Mourning Your Friend
No one with a beloved dog likes to think about the fact that dogs
live much shorter lives than humans. Most of the time, humans will
outlive their Dachshunds, and that means having to lose a friend.
Losing a pet is a hard passage, especially in our society where pets
have become increasingly meaningful in our lives. Pet owners go to
such lengths to make their pets happy and healthy. When we lose
them, it’s heartbreaking.
In the following sections, I help you prepare for that time you and
your Dachshund will someday face together.
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
238

Making the euthanasia decision
Perhaps the most difficult part of losing a pet is making the 
decision to euthanize. If your Dachshund is in severe pain and 
can’t be treated or is otherwise suffering, your vet may recommend
euthanasia. Euthanasia typically involves administering a dose of 
a barbiturate, which is a drug commonly used as an anesthetic.
The dose is sufficient to allow the heart and the breathing to come
to a gradual, peaceful stop.
Veterinary medicine has advanced to the point where much of 
a pet’s suffering can be relieved. Some people choose to let their
Dachshunds die naturally at home while treating pain and other
symptoms. But in some cases, quality of life has diminished to the
point that a pet owner believes his or her Dachshund really is
ready to go. But how do you know for sure?
The decision is a tough one, and it’s all yours. Your vet can make 
a recommendation, but only you can decide. That puts an awful lot
of power in your hands, and sometimes the only way to make the
decision is to listen to what your Dachshund is telling and showing
you — and to your heart.
If you do decide that euthanasia is the best, or only, option, don’t
feel guilty. Sure, you’ll feel a little guilty. Who wouldn’t? This is a
momentous decision. But remember that your Dachshund trusts
you to do what’s best for her. Sometimes, you have to love them
more to let them go.
If your Dachshund requires an extensive, costly medical treatment
that you simply can’t afford, and you think your only option is
euthanasia, consider contacting a local or national Dachshund
rescue group (see Chapter 5 for contact information). Another
person or even the rescue organization itself may be willing to
adopt your Dachshund, pay for the surgery, and then place her
into a good home. Surely this is a better option than euthanasia.
(You can’t, however, expect a rescue organization to pay for the
medical treatment and then return the Dachshund to you.)
Chapter 18: Enjoying Your Senior Dachshie and Saying Goodbye 239
Long live the dachshund
Amos and Archie, the Dachshunds that belonged to painter and pop-culture icon
Andy Warhol, both outlived him. When Warhol died, a friend took the Dachshunds
and cared for them until they died at the ripe old ages of 19 and 20.

Some people struggle with the euthanasia decision more than others.
If you really aren’t sure what to do, wait a little longer until you are
sure. Then, when it is time, if you can bear it, your Dachshund will
feel safer and less stressed if you — the one she loves the most —
are there to hold her, talk to her, and comfort her in her final
moments.
Afterward, your veterinarian can advise you about burial, cremation,
and other options. Sometimes, a memorial to your pet can help with
the grieving process.
Grieving for your Dachsie
If you’ve ever known, loved, and lost a dog, you know how heart-
breaking it can be. People don’t like to admit that they’re grieving
over pets, but why not? Dogs are true companions to humans, and
our society has evolved in such a way that many people consider
their dogs to be members of their families. Of course you’ll be grief-
stricken when a member of your family passes away. It would be
unnatural not to be saddened by such a loss.
Still, people feel silly. Who wants to admit to sobbing alone in a
room because that warm body is no longer at your side? Yet people
do it every day. Fortunately, more and more people are opening up
about the grieving process as it applies to pets. You can even pur-
chase sympathy cards for people who have lost pets. Such a gesture
is usually appreciated far beyond the thank you that you may
receive if you send one.
If you’re the grieving one, you can do some things to help yourself
get through the process. Knowing a little about the stages of the
grieving process may help. You’ll go through the following stages
after your loss — the same stages that anyone who’s lost a loved
one goes through:
 Denial: At first, you won’t quite be able to believe or accept
that your pet is gone. You may forget that she is gone and call
for her or look for her — even prepare her food. This is a pro-
tective mechanism. Your mind is giving you a chance to adjust
to the notion before experiencing the full weight of the grief.
You may also experience this stage if your pet is very ill and
you don’t want to admit to yourself that she probably won’t
pull through.
 Bargaining: This stage is more common in the human grieving
process, but it can still happen with pets. You may make deals
with yourself or with a higher power: “If she lives, I promise
Part IV: Helping Your Dachshund Stay Healthy 
240

never to let her escape from the backyard again.” “If she pulls
through the surgery, I’ll never yell at her again.”
 Anger: This stage may surprise you. You aren’t angry at your
pet, yet you feel abandoned. Sometimes anger manifests as
guilt: “If only I hadn’t . . .” You may be angry at yourself, or
you may blame someone else — a vet or another family
member. Try not to let yourself get caught up in the guilt-and-
blame cycle. It doesn’t help; it will just make you feel worse.
 Grief: After you’ve let go of your anger, the real grief sets in.
You feel an overwhelming sadness. This is the time when you
need support and someone to talk to. If you don’t have an
understanding and sympathetic friend or family member, call
a pet support hotline. Knowing you aren’t the only one who
has ever felt this badly about the loss of a pet will help; even
just talking about your pet will make you feel better. This is a
tough stage, but you can make it through. (See the section on
pet loss resources later in this chapter for more help.)
 Resolution: When your grief begins to fade (it may never go
away entirely), you’ll finally come to a resolution about the
loss. Ending the grieving process doesn’t mean that you’ve
forgotten your beloved friend. It simply means that you’ll
remember the good times more than the bad and that you’ll
find a sense of peace and joy in the memory of your
Dachshund. You’ll recognize that your Dachshund has left you
more, in the form of memories and unconditional love, than
she took with her. You were lucky to share part of your life
with such a wonderful creature. At last, when you reach this
final stage, you’ll feel lucky once again.
Holding some kind of memorial service can be of tremendous 
help. Formal or informal, a memorial service allows all who knew
and loved your pet to come together and remember. Tears and
laughter are common at such events, and the final feeling is often
one of healing.
Utilizing pet-loss resources
Many excellent books and Web sites are there to help with the 
subject of pet loss and bereavement. Here are a few good ones 
I recommend:
 The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement is a nonprofit
group of concerned people who are experienced and knowl-
edgeable in the tender subject of pet death. Members are pro-
fessional counselors as well as pet-loving people from all walks

Most of all, remember that it’s okay to grieve for your lost 
pet. Millions of people understand and have been exactly where
you are. You loved your Dachshund. Your Dachshund understood
you. You’re lonely without your pet. Your grief is a sign of your
love, and even if you feel you made mistakes as a caretaker and
Dachshund companion (we all do), remember that your love made
your Dachshund’s life better. Similarly, your Dachshund made your 
life richer and more amazing than it would’ve been without a
Dachsie at your side.

Ten Good Foods, 
Ten Bad Foods
In This Chapter
 Feeding your Dachshund good people food (occasionally)
 Avoiding dangerous people foods
P
lenty of people can’t resist giving their Dachshunds just a little
bite of this and just a tiny smidgen of that. After all, how can
you turn down those pleading, hungry faces! A little bit of healthy
people food won’t hurt a Dachshund, as long as your Dachsie isn’t
ingesting too many calories. In fact, a variety of healthy foods may
actually be good for your Dachshund. (Many experts disagree, but
it makes sense to me that real whole food is good for dogs on a
processed kibble diet.) But you must avoid making the mistake of
choosing the wrong foods — meals that could actually hurt your
Dachshund. This chapter is your guide to the good foods and 
the bad.
Ten Great People Foods 
for Dachshunds
The foods in the following list may be good foods to give, but always
feed these foods in moderation. Use them as a flavorful addition to
your Dachshund’s regular balanced diet (see Chapter 8):
 Lean meat: Dogs love meat, and some people (including this
book’s illustrious Technical Editor) say they don’t get enough.
Examples include beef, chicken, turkey, or fish. Make sure you
give small pieces.

 Lowfat cottage cheese: Dish out just a spoonful to supplement
meals and treats, unless this method disagrees with your dog.
Many dogs think it’s just great, and it adds protein.
 Olive, canola, or flaxseed oil: Drizzle a teaspoon over your
Dachshund’s kibble. Your dog’s skin and coat will feel sooo soft.
 Nonfat, plain yogurt: One tablespoon mixed with your
Dachshund’s regular food should do the trick. Yogurt is espe-
cially good for dogs that are having a mild stomach issue like
diarrhea. It helps replenish the gut with friendly bacteria.
(Doesn’t sound too appetizing, but it’s true!)
 Scrambled eggs: A few bits left over from your breakfast
makes for a healthy addition to your Dachshund’s regular
food. Some say this is the perfect protein supplement.
 Broccoli florets: Small pieces, raw or cooked, make good
training treats for dogs that like broccoli.
 Lettuce or other greens: Try crunchy bits of Romaine, collards,
or kale. Some Dachshunds won’t eat this treat (they prefer the
meat and beernuts), but some health fanatics love it. (Just 
kidding, don’t give your dog beer nuts!)
 Baby carrots: These are great for treats — they have all the
crunch of a dog cookie but none of the starch and preserva-
tives. Cut them in half for Mini Dachshunds.
 Blueberries: These are good fresh or frozen, and they’re so
fun to play with before they go down the hatch. Some dogs
will bat them around for hours. (And then, inevitably, you’ll
step on one with your bare foot, squishing it into your white
carpet. But, hey, you have a dog . . . why do you have a white
carpet?)
 Peanut butter: Every now and then, your Dachshund may
enjoy licking a little peanut butter off a spoon. Use the natural
kind of peanut butter without the added sugar and salt. Rub
some on a chew toy and keep your Dachsie engaged for twice
as long.
Ten Foods You Should Never 
Feed Your Dachshund
The foods in the following list won’t necessarily harm every dog, 
but many dogs have developed serious illnesses after eating these
seemingly harmless people foods. Why take a chance? I suggest that
Part V: The Part of Tens 
250

you never, ever feed your Dachshund any of these ten foods. If you
believe your dog has ingested any of them, call your vet right away
for advice.
 Chocolate: Both the theobromine and the caffeine in chocolate
can be very harmful to dogs. Baker’s chocolate is the worst, but
even milk chocolate can make a dog sick.
 Grapes and raisins: These “treats” can cause kidney failure 
in some dogs — especially if they eat a lot of them. For a small
dog, even a few could cause toxicity.
 Macadamia nuts: These yummy nuts can be very toxic for
dogs, causing vomiting, pain, and neurological symptoms.
 Onions or garlic: Frequent ingestion of onions can cause
severe anemia and even death. Small amounts can cause gas-
trointestinal distress, because dogs can’t digest onions very
well. Onions may even be more dangerous than garlic, per-
haps because foods often contain more onions than garlic. In
fact, many natural pet foods, treats, and homemade dog food
recipes contain a little garlic. Some people believe garlic can
help ward off fleas. However, neither onions nor garlic should
be a daily part of your dog’s diet.
 Coffee and tea: Don’t let your Dachshund help you drink your
coffee, no matter how cute that may be. The caffeine and other
acids in coffee are very unhealthy for him. The same goes for
your tea. Plus, dogs that eat coffee beans or coffee grounds
can get very ill.
 Alcoholic beverages: The same goes for your beer, your wine,
or your martinis. No, no, and no! (Although I know of one com-
pany that makes a non-alcoholic beer for dogs. I haven’t tried
it, though.)
 High-fat foods: Dogs don’t digest high-fat foods very well, and
too many fatty foods can cause pancreatitis — especially in
smaller dogs. Your Dachsie may look like a hot dog, but high-
fat, processed meats like hot dogs, bacon, and deli meats are
dangerous because of the high sodium and nitrate content.
 Xylitol: This artificial sweetener, which you find in many sugar-
free human foods (like sugar-free gum), is very toxic for dogs. 
If your Dachsie accidentally ingests something with xylitol, call
your vet immediately.
 Avocado: Some pet foods contain avocado, but experts —
including those at the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center —
say that avocado is extremely toxic to some animals, and its
effects aren’t fully understood in dogs and cats. Avoid avocado,
just to be safe.
Chapter 20: Ten Good Foods, Ten Bad Foods 251

 Milk and cheese: Some dogs can eat small amounts of dairy
products without a problem, but many can suffer from intes-
tinal distress from dairy products (other than the fermented
kinds, like yogurt and cottage cheese). Avoid the high-fat, hard
cheeses. And your dog really doesn’t need to finish the milk in
your cereal bowl!

Most people are familiar with smooth Dachshunds,but there are two other coat types:
longhairs,such as the Miniature Dachshund (above),and wirehairs (below).

Smooth Dachshunds are perfect for people who don’t have the time or patience for grooming.
A double-dappled Dachshund is a dappled Dachshund with patches of white.

These wirehair 
pups demonstrate 
the Dachshund’s
lively, curious 
temperament.
Going on an errand?
Take your Dachshund
along.

For a longhaired Dachshund,daily grooming is a must.
This black-and-tan color 
combination is common
in many dog breeds.

Though there’s no denying a
piebald Dachshund’s beauty,
they are disqualified from 
competition in every country
except the United States.
Dachshund puppies
tend to chew,so 
provide them with 
plenty of chew toys.
Daily walks and even the 
occasional swim will keep your
Dachshund healthy.

Dachshunds love to be in the middle of everything.
Some red Dachshunds 
look almost brown,but
Dachshund people still call
these dogs “red.”

Your Dachshund’s daily 
routine should include plenty
of socialization with people.
The Dachshund’s compact legs
serve as powerful excavators.
Dachshunds can dig out anything
and dig into or out of anywhere –
including snow.

Dachshunds feel  at home when they have blankets and quilts for burrowing.
Cream Dachshunds can range from gold to almost white.
