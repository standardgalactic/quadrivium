About the Authors
Mark Middlebrook used to be an engineer but gave it up when he discovered
that he couldn’t handle a real job. He is now principal of Daedalus Consulting,
an independent CAD and computer consulting company in Oakland, California.
(In case you wondered, Daedalus was the guy in ancient Greek legend who built
the labyrinth on Crete. Mark named his company after Daedalus before he real-
ized that few of his clients would be able to pronounce it and even fewer spell
it.) Mark is also a contributing editor for Cadalyst magazine and Webmaster of
markcad.com. When he’s not busy being a cad, Mark sells and writes about
wine for Paul Marcus Wines in Oakland. He also teaches literature and philoso-
phy classes at St. Mary’s College of California — hence “Daedalus.” AutoCAD
2006 For Dummies is his eighth book on AutoCAD.
David Byrnes is one of those grizzled old-timers you’ll find mentioned every
so often in AutoCAD 2006 For Dummies. He began his drafting career on the
boards in 1979 and discovered computer-assisted doodling shortly thereafter.
He first learned AutoCAD with version 1.4, around the time when personal
computers switched from steam to diesel power. Dave is based in Vancouver,
British Columbia, and has been an AutoCAD consultant and trainer for fifteen
years. Dave is a contributing editor for Cadalyst magazine and has been a con-
tributing author to ten books on AutoCAD. He teaches AutoCAD and other
computer graphics applications at Emily Carr Institute of Art + Design and
British Columbia Institute of Technology in Vancouver. Dave has tech edited
six AutoCAD For Dummies titles. AutoCAD 2006 For Dummies is his first
chance to make his own errors.


Dedication
From Mark: To Puck and Pretzel, two absolute AutoCAD dummies who never
cease to inspire and amuse. It was during walks in the woods with them that I
originally worked out some of the details of these chapters. I’m pretty sure
that Puck could learn AutoCAD, if only he could figure out how to manipulate
a mouse. Pretzel, on the other hand, is too interested in squirrels to bother
with mice.
From Dave: To Anna and Delia, the two women in my life, who remind me
there are other things besides keyboards and mice (and sometimes they have
to try REALLY hard).
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Mark thanks Bud Smith, who initiated this book seven editions ago, brought
him in on it along the way, and eventually handed it over to him in toto. Dave
in turn thanks Mark for bringing him on board as co-author, and for asking
him to tech edit the book for the last five editions.
Thanks too to two colleagues and friends at Autodesk, Shaan Hurley and Bud
Schroeder, who never seem to mind being asked even the dumbest questions.
We both thank Terri Varveris, who again shepherded the project through the
development process; her enthusiasm and infectious energy have helped
make each new edition more than just an obligatory update. It was also a
great pleasure to work with our frequent project editor Nicole Sholly and
copy editor Jean Rogers. And by no means least, but someone has to bring
up the rear, thanks to Lee Ambrosius for taking over the tech editing job.
Lee’s expertise is well known and respected in the AutoCAD community, and
we’re delighted to have him with us.

AutoCAD 2006 For Dummies

Introduction
I
t’s amazing to think that AutoCAD came into being over two decades ago,
at a time when most people thought that personal computers weren’t
capable of industrial-strength tasks like CAD. (The acronym stands for
Computer-Aided Drafting, Computer-Aided Design, or both, depending on
whom you talk to.) It’s almost as amazing that, more than 20 years after its
birth, AutoCAD remains the king of the microcomputer CAD hill by a tall
margin. Many competing CAD programs have come to challenge AutoCAD,
many have fallen, and a few are still around. One hears rumblings that the
long-term future of CAD may belong to special-purpose, 3D-based software
such as the Autodesk Inventor and Revit programs. Whether or not those
rumblings amplify into a roar remains to be seen, but for the present and the
near future anyway, AutoCAD is where the CAD action is.
In its evolution, AutoCAD has grown more complex, in part to keep up with
the increasing complexity of the design and drafting processes that AutoCAD
is intended to serve. It’s not enough just to draw nice-looking lines anymore.
If you want to play CAD with the big boys and girls, you need to organize the
objects you draw, their properties, and the files in which they reside in
appropriate ways. You need to coordinate your CAD work with other people
in your office who will be working on or making use of the same drawings.
You need to be savvy about shipping drawings around via the Internet. 
AutoCAD 2006 provides the tools for doing all these things, but it’s not always
easy to figure out which hammer to pick up or which nail to bang on first.
With this book, you have an excellent chance of creating a presentable,
usable, printable, and sharable drawing on your first or second try without
putting a T square through your computer screen in frustration.
What’s Not in This Book
Unlike many other For Dummies books, this one does tell you to consult the
official software documentation sometimes. AutoCAD is just too big and com-
plicated for a single book to attempt to describe it completely. 
AutoCAD is also too big and complicated for us to cover every feature. We
don’t address advanced topics like database connectivity, customization, and
programming in the interest of bringing you a book of a reasonable size —
one that you’ll read rather than stick on your shelf with those other thousand-
page tomes! For this edition, we removed the chapter on 3D that was in 
previous editions in order to make room for a new “A Lap around the CAD

Track” chapter. This new Chapter 3 guides you through the standard sequence
of creating, drawing, editing, and plotting a CAD drawing. Our experience is
that the great majority of AutoCAD users (and virtually all AutoCAD LT users
because AutoCAD LT does not support the creation of 3D objects) use the
software for 2D drafting. But fear not — we’ve posted an updated version of
the 3D chapter on Mark’s Web site. If you’d like to get started with 3D CAD,
just point your browser to www.markcad.com/books/acad2006fd. The Web
site also features other AutoCAD information, sample drawing templates,
add-on utility programs, and articles.
This book focuses on AutoCAD 2006 and addresses its slightly less-capable,
much lower-cost sibling, AutoCAD LT 2006. We do occasionally mention dif-
ferences with previous versions, going back to the highly popular AutoCAD
Release 14, so that everyone has some context and upgraders can more read-
ily understand the differences. We also mention the important differences
between full AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, so that you’ll know what you — or your
LT-using colleagues — are missing. This book does not cover the discipline-
specific features in AutoCAD-based products such as Autodesk Architectural
Desktop, except for some general discussion in Chapter 1, but most of the
information in this book applies to the general-purpose AutoCAD features in
the AutoCAD 2006–based versions of those programs as well.
Who Are — and Aren’t — You?
AutoCAD has a large, loyal, and dedicated group of long-time users. This
book is not for the sort of people who have been using AutoCAD for a decade,
who plan their vacation time around Autodesk University, or who consider
1,000-page-plus technical tomes about AutoCAD as pleasure reading. This book
is for people who want to get going quickly with AutoCAD, but who also know
the importance of developing proper CAD techniques from the beginning.
However, you do need to have some idea of how to use your computer
system before tackling AutoCAD — and this book. You need to have a com-
puter system with AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT (preferably the 2006 version). A
printer or plotter and a connection to the Internet will be big helps, too.
You also need to know how to use Windows to copy and delete files, create a
folder, and find a file. You need to know how to use a mouse to select (high-
light) or to choose (activate) commands, how to close a window, and how to
minimize and maximize windows. Make sure that you’re familiar with the
basics of your operating system before you start with AutoCAD.

How This Book Is Organized
Appearances can be deceptive. For example, if you saw the apparently
random piles of stuff that covered the authors’ desks while they were writing
this book, you might wonder how they could possibly organize a paragraph,
let alone an entire book. But each of us (given some concerted thought)
knows exactly where to put our hands on that list of new dimension vari-
ables, or that bag of 1⁄2" binder clips, or the rest of that bagel and cream
cheese we started at coffee break. 
We hope you’ll find that the book also reflects some concerted thought about
how to present AutoCAD in a way that’s both easy-to-dip-into and smoothly-
flowing-from-beginning-to-end.
The organization of this book into parts — collections of related chapters —
is one of the most important, uh, parts of this book. You really can get to
know AutoCAD one piece at a time, and each part represents a group of
closely related topics. The order of parts also says something about priority;
yes, you have our permission to ignore the stuff in later parts until you’ve
mastered most of the stuff in the early ones. This kind of building-block
approach can be especially valuable in a program as powerful as AutoCAD.
The following sections describe the parts that the book breaks down into.
Part I: AutoCAD 101
Need to know your way around the AutoCAD screen? Why does AutoCAD
even exist, anyway? What are all the different AutoCAD-based products 
that Autodesk sells, and should you be using one of them — for example,
AutoCAD LT — instead of AutoCAD? Is everything so slooow because it’s 
supposed to be slow, or do you have too wimpy a machine to use this
wonder of modern-day computing? And why do you have to do this stuff in
the first place?
Part I answers all these questions — and more. This part also includes what
may seem like a great deal of excruciating detail about setting up a new draw-
ing in AutoCAD. But what’s even more excruciating is to do your setup work
incorrectly and then feel as though AutoCAD is fighting you every step of the
way. With a little drawing setup work done in advance, it won’t.
3
Introduction

Part II: Let There Be Lines
In this part, it’s time for some essential concepts, including object properties
and CAD precision techniques. We know that you’re raring to make some draw-
ings, but if you don’t get a handle on this stuff early on, you’ll be terminally —
or is that monitor-ally? — confused when you try to draw and edit objects. 
If you want to make drawings that look good, plot good, and are good, read
this stuff!
After the concepts preamble, the bulk of this part covers the trio of activities
that you’ll probably spend most of your time in AutoCAD doing: drawing
objects, editing them, and zooming and panning to see them better on the
screen. These are the things that you do in order to create the geometry —
that is, the CAD representations of the objects in the real world that you’re
designing. By the end of Part II, you should be pretty good at geometry, even
if your ninth-grade math teacher told you otherwise.
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk
CAD drawings do not live on lines alone — most of them require quite a bit of
text, dimensioning, and hatching in order to make the design intent clear to
the poor chump who has to build your amazing creation. (Whoever said “a
picture is worth a thousand words” must not have counted up the number of
words on the average architectural drawing!) This part shows you how to
add these essential features to your drawings.
After you’ve gussied up your drawing with text, dimensions, and hatching,
you’ll probably want to create a snapshot of it to show off to your client, con-
tractor, or grandma. Normal people call this process printing, but CAD people
call it plotting. Whatever you decide to call it, we show you how to do it.
Part IV: Share and Share Alike
A good CAD user, like a good kindergartner, plays well with others. AutoCAD
encourages this behavior with a host of drawing- and data-sharing features.
Blocks, external reference files, and raster images encourage reuse of parts 
of drawings, entire drawings, and bitmap image files. AutoCAD 2006’s new
dynamic blocks feature offers unlimited possibilities for creating shareable
blocks that can have actions associated with them, or that can take on differ-
ent appearances. CAD standards serve as the table manners of the CAD pro-
duction process — they define and regulate how people create drawings so
that sharing can be more productive and predictable. AutoCAD’s Internet fea-
tures enable sharing of drawings well beyond your hard disk and local network.
4
AutoCAD 2006 For Dummies 

The drawing and data-sharing features in AutoCAD take you way beyond 
old-style, pencil-and-paper design and drafting. After you’ve discovered how
to apply the techniques in this part, you’ll be well on your way to full CAD-
nerdhood (you may want to warn your family beforehand). 
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part contains guidelines that minimize your chances of really messing
up drawings (your own or others’) and techniques for swapping drawings
with other people and accessing them from other computer programs.
There’s a lot of meat packed into these two chapters — juicy tidbits from
years of drafting, experimentation, and fist-shaking at things that don’t work
right — not to mention years of compulsive list-making. We hope that you
find that these lists help you get on the right track quickly and stay there.
Icons Used in This Book
This icon tells you that herein lies a pointed insight that can save you time
and trouble as you use AutoCAD. In many cases, tip paragraphs act as a
funnel on AutoCAD’s impressive but sometimes overwhelming flexibility:
After telling you all the ways that you can do something, we tell you the way
that you should do it in most cases. 
The Technical Stuff icon points out places where we delve a little more deeply
into AutoCAD’s inner workings or point out something that most people don’t
need to know about most of the time. These paragraphs definitely are not
required reading the first time through, so if you come to one of them at a time
when you’ve reached your techie detail threshold, feel free to skip over them.
This icon tells you how to stay out of trouble when living a little close to the
edge. Failure to heed its message may have unpleasant consequences for you
and your drawing — or maybe for both of you.
There’s a lot to remember when you’re using AutoCAD, so we’ve remembered
to remind you about some of those things that you should be remembering.
These paragraphs usually refer to a crucial point earlier in the chapter or in a
previous chapter. So if you’re reading sequentially, a remember paragraph
serves as a friendly reminder. If you’re not reading sequentially, this kind of
paragraph may help you realize that you need to review a central concept or
technique before proceeding.
This icon points to new stuff in AutoCAD 2006. It’s mostly designed for those
of you who are somewhat familiar with a previous version of AutoCAD and
want to be alerted to what’s new in this version. New AutoCAD users starting
5
Introduction

out their CAD working lives with AutoCAD 2006 will find this stuff interesting,
too — especially when they can show off their new book-learnin’ to the griz-
zled AutoCAD veterans in the office who don’t yet know about all the cool,
new features.
This icon highlights differences between AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD. If you’re
using AutoCAD LT, you’ll find out what you’re missing compared to “full”
AutoCAD. If your friend is using LT, you’ll know where to look to find stuff in
AutoCAD to brag about.
A Few Conventions — Just in Case
You probably can figure out for yourself all the information in this section,
but here are the details just in case.
Text you type into the program at the command line, in a dialog box, in a text
box, and so on appears in boldface type. Examples of AutoCAD prompts
appear in a special typeface, as does any other text in the book that
echoes a message, a word, or one or more lines of text that actually appear
on-screen. Sequences of prompts that appear in the AutoCAD command line
area have a shaded background, like so:
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.0000,0.0000>:
(Many of the figures — especially in Chapters 6 and 7 — also show AutoCAD
command line sequences that demonstrate AutoCAD’s prompts and example
responses.)
Often in this book, you see phrases such as “choose File➪Save As from the
menu bar.” The funny little arrow (➪) separates the main menu name from
the specific command on that menu. In this example, you open the File menu
and choose the Save As command. If you know another way to start the same
command (in this example, type SAVEAS and press Enter), you’re welcome to
do it that way instead. 
Many AutoCAD commands have shortcut (fewer letter) versions for the bene-
fit of those who like to type commands at the AutoCAD command prompt. In
this book, we format command names with the shortcut letters in uppercase
and the other letters in lowercase, so that you become familiar with the
shortcuts and can use them if you want to. So when you see an instruction
like “run the DimLInear command to draw a linear dimension,” it means “for a
linear dimension, type DIMLINEAR, or DLI for short, at the command line,
and then press the Enter key.”

utoCAD is more than just another application pro-
gram; it’s a complete environment for drafting and
design. So if you’re new to AutoCAD, you need to know
several things to get off to a good start — especially how
to use the command line area and set up your drawing
properly. These key techniques are described in this part
of the book.
If you’ve used earlier versions of AutoCAD, you’ll be most
interested in the high points of the new release, including
some newer interface components. The lowdown on
what’s new is here, too.

elcome to the fraternity whose members are the users of one of the
weirdest, wackiest, and most wonderful computer programs in the
world: AutoCAD. Maybe you’re one of the few remaining holdouts who con-
tinues to practice the ancient art of manual drafting with pencil and vellum.
Or maybe you’re completely new to drafting and yearn for the wealth and
fame of the drafter’s life. Maybe you’re an engineer or architect who needs to
catch up with the young CAD hotshots in your office. Or maybe you’re a full-
time drafter whose fingers haven’t yet been pried away from your beloved
drafting board. Maybe you tried to use AutoCAD a long time ago but gave up
in frustration or just got rusty. Or maybe you currently use an older version,
such as AutoCAD 2000 or even (if you like antiques) Release 14. 
Whatever your current situation and motivation, we hope that you enjoy the
process of becoming proficient with AutoCAD. Drawing with AutoCAD is chal-
lenging at first, but it’s a challenge worth meeting. CAD rewards those who
think creatively about their work and look for ways to do it better. You can
always find out more, discover a new trick, or improve the efficiency and
quality of your drawing production.
AutoCAD first hit the bricks in the early 1980s, around the same time as the
first IBM PCs. It was offered for a bewildering variety of operating systems,
including CP/M (ask your granddad about that one!), various flavors of UNIX,
and even Apple’s Macintosh. By far, the most popular of those early versions

was for MS-DOS (your dad can tell you about that one). Eventually, Autodesk
settled on Microsoft Windows as the sole operating system for AutoCAD.
AutoCAD 2006 works with Windows XP — Professional, Home, and Tablet PC
editions — and Windows 2000. 
Because of AutoCAD’s MS-DOS heritage and its emphasis on efficiency for
production drafters, it’s not the easiest program to master, but it has gotten
easier and more consistent. AutoCAD is pretty well integrated into the
Windows environment now, but you still bump into some vestiges of its MS-
DOS legacy — especially the command line (that text area lurking at the
bottom of the AutoCAD screen — see Chapter 2 for details). But even the
command line has gotten kinder and gentler in AutoCAD 2006. This book
guides you around the bumps and minimizes the bruises.
Why AutoCAD?
AutoCAD has been around a long time — since 1982. AutoCAD ushered in the
transition from really expensive mainframe and minicomputer CAD systems
costing tens of thousands of dollars to merely expensive microcomputer CAD
programs costing a few thousand dollars.
AutoCAD is, first and foremost, a program to create technical drawings; draw-
ings in which measurements and precision are important, because these kinds
of drawings often get used to build something. The drawings you create with
AutoCAD must adhere to standards established long ago for hand-drafted
drawings. The up-front investment to use AutoCAD is certainly more expen-
sive than the investment needed to use pencil and paper, and the learning
curve is much steeper, too. Why bother? The key reasons for using AutoCAD
rather than pencil and paper are
 Precision: Creating lines, circles, and other shapes of the exactly correct
dimensions is easier with AutoCAD than with pencils.
 Modifiability: Drawings are much easier to modify on the computer
screen than on paper. CAD modifications are a lot cleaner, too.
 Efficiency: Creating many kinds of drawings is faster with a CAD 
program — especially drawings that involve repetition, such as floor
plans in a multistory building. But that efficiency takes skill and prac-
tice. If you’re an accomplished pencil-and-paper drafter, don’t expect
CAD to be faster at first!
Figure 1-1 shows several kinds of drawings in AutoCAD 2006.
10
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Why choose AutoCAD? AutoCAD is just the starting point of a whole industry
of software products designed to work with AutoCAD. Autodesk has helped
this process along immensely by designing a series of programming inter-
faces to AutoCAD that other companies — and Autodesk itself — have used
to extend the application. Some of the add-on products have become such
winners that Autodesk acquired them and incorporated them into its own
products. When you compare all the resources — including the add-ons,
extensions, training courses, books, and so on — AutoCAD doesn’t have
much PC CAD competition.
The Importance of Being DWG
To take full advantage of AutoCAD in your work environment, you need to be
aware of the DWG file format, the format in which AutoCAD saves drawings.
In some cases, an older version of AutoCAD can’t open a DWG file that’s been
saved by a newer version of AutoCAD.

Chapter 1: Introducing AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT

 A newer version of AutoCAD always can open files saved by an older 
version.
 Some previous versions of AutoCAD can open files saved by the subse-
quent one or two versions. For example, AutoCAD 2004 can open DWG
files saved by AutoCAD 2006. That’s because Autodesk didn’t change the
DWG file format between AutoCAD 2004 and AutoCAD 2006.
 You can use the Save As option in newer versions to save the file to
some older DWG formats.
Table 1-1 shows which versions (described later in this chapter) use which
DWG file formats.

Working with AutoCAD is easier when your co-workers and colleagues in
other companies all use the same version of AutoCAD and AutoCAD-related
tools. That way, your DWG files, add-on tools, and even the details of your CAD
knowledge can be mixed and matched among your workgroup and partners.
In the real world, you may work with people — at least in other companies —
who use AutoCAD versions as old as Release 14.
Many programs claim to be DWG-compatible — that is, capable of converting
data to and from AutoCAD’s DWG format. But achieving this compatibility is a
difficult thing to do well. Even a small error in file conversion can have results
ranging in severity from annoying to appalling. If you exchange DWG files
with people who use other CAD programs, be prepared to spend time finding
and fixing translation problems.
12
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

AutoCAD 2006 can save files as far back as AutoCAD 2000 format. If you need
to go back farther than that (say, for a die-hard client still using Release 14),
you can save to the R12 DXF format, which AutoCAD Release 14 will open —
see Chapter 18 for instructions. An alternative is to download a copy of
Autodesk’s Batch File Converter, which will save your files back to Release 14
DWG. See Chapter 18 for more information.
Seeing the LT
AutoCAD LT is one of the best deals around, a shining example of the old
80/20 rule: roughly 80 percent of the capabilities of AutoCAD for roughly 20
percent of the money. Like AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT runs on mainstream
Windows computers and doesn’t require any additional hardware devices.
With AutoCAD LT, you can be a player in the world of AutoCAD, the world’s
leading CAD program, for a comparatively low starting cost.
AutoCAD LT is a very close cousin to AutoCAD. Autodesk creates AutoCAD LT
by starting with the AutoCAD program, taking out a few features to justify
charging a lower price, adding a couple of features to enhance ease of use
versus full AutoCAD, and testing the result.
13
Chapter 1: Introducing AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
AutoCAD-based applications
Autodesk has expanded AutoCAD into a whole
product line of programs with AutoCAD as a
base and specialized, discipline-specific add-
ons built on top and included as one complete
product. As an AutoCAD 2006 user, you’ll be
looking for the 2006-compatible versions of
these tools, which should appear a few months
after AutoCAD 2006 ships. These discipline-
specific flavors of AutoCAD include Autodesk
Architectural Desktop and Autodesk Building
Systems (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing),
Autodesk Mechanical Desktop, Autodesk Map,
AutoCAD Land Desktop, Autodesk Survey, and
Autodesk Civil Design.
To make matters even more confusing,
Autodesk now offers Autodesk Revit and
Autodesk Inventor, software applications that
compete with Architectural Desktop and
Mechanical Desktop, respectively. Revit and
Inventor are not based on AutoCAD; they 
sacrifice AutoCAD compatibility in favor of a
more fundamentally design- and 3D-oriented
approach to CAD. Whether they ultimately will
replace the traditional AutoCAD-based applica-
tions remains to be seen. Thus far, most com-
panies seem to be sticking with AutoCAD and
the AutoCAD-based Desktop applications.
In addition to the products from Autodesk, thou-
sands of AutoCAD add-on products — both dis-
cipline-specific and general-purpose — are
available from other software developers.
These companion products are sometimes
called third-party applications. Visit partner
products.autodesk.com for more infor-
mation about what’s available.

As a result, AutoCAD LT looks and works much like AutoCAD. The opening
screen and menus of the two programs are nearly identical. (LT is missing a
few commands from the AutoCAD menus.)
In fact, the major difference between the programs has nothing to do with the
programs themselves. The major difference is that AutoCAD LT lacks support
for several customization and programming languages that are used to develop
AutoCAD add-ons. So almost none of the add-on programs or utilities offered
by Autodesk and others are available to LT users.
AutoCAD LT also has only limited 3D support. You can view and edit 3D
objects in AutoCAD LT, so you can work with drawings created in AutoCAD
that contain 3D objects. However, you cannot create true 3D objects in LT.
The lack of 3D object creation in LT is not as big a negative for many users as
you may think. Despite a lot of hype from the computer press and CAD ven-
dors (including Autodesk), 3D CAD remains a relatively specialized activity.
The majority of people use CAD programs to create 2D drawings.
Although you may hear claims that AutoCAD LT is easier to master and use
than AutoCAD, the truth is that they’re about equally difficult (or easy, depend-
ing on your nerd IQ). The LT learning curve doesn’t differ significantly from
that of AutoCAD. AutoCAD was originally designed for maximum power and
then modified somewhat to improve ease of use. AutoCAD LT shares this
same heritage.
Fortunately, the minimal differences between LT and AutoCAD mean that
after you have climbed that learning curve, you’ll have the same great view.
You’ll have almost the full range of AutoCAD’s 2D drafting tools, and you’ll be
able to exchange DWG files with AutoCAD users without data loss.
This book covers AutoCAD 2006, but almost all the information in it applies
to AutoCAD LT 2006 as well. The icon that you see at the left of this paragraph
highlights significant differences. 
Getting Your Kicks with 2006
You should know the following before you upgrade from a previous AutoCAD
release:
 Wash those old Windows: AutoCAD 2006 does not support older ver-
sions of Windows, such as Windows NT, 98, and Me. You must use
Windows XP (Professional, Home, or Tablet PC) or Windows 2000.
14
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

 DWG file compatibility: AutoCAD 2006 uses the AutoCAD 2004 DWG file
format, so you’ll be able to exchange files easily with users of AutoCAD
2004 and 2005. You can use File➪Save As to create DWG files for users of
AutoCAD 2000, 2000i, and 2002, but not for AutoCAD Release 14 and ear-
lier versions. (To get around this limitation, you can save to the Release
12 DXF format — see Chapter 18 for instructions.)
 Application compatibility: If you use third-party applications with a pre-
vious version of AutoCAD, they may not work with AutoCAD 2006. Many
AutoCAD 2004 and 2005 applications, including those developed with
the ARX (AutoCAD Runtime eXtension) and VBA (Visual Basic for
Applications) programming interfaces will work with AutoCAD 2006, 
but older ARX and VBA applications won’t work.
Many LSP (AutoLISP) programs written for the last several versions of
AutoCAD work with AutoCAD 2006.
 Increased computer system requirements: For AutoCAD 2006, Autodesk
recommends an 800 MHz Pentium III or better processor, at least 256MB
of RAM, 1024 x 768 or higher display resolution with True Color graphics,
300MB of available hard disk space, an Internet connection, and Microsoft
Internet Explorer 6.0 with Service Pack 1 or later.
AutoCAD 2006 comes out a mere year after AutoCAD 2005 and thus doesn’t
sport quite as many new features as did some earlier upgrades, many of
which came out at two-year intervals. The new features and feature improve-
ments in AutoCAD 2006, however, are well conceived and worthwhile. Three
especially great new features are 
 Dynamic input: You can almost forget about the command prompt.
AutoCAD 2006 features a heads-up interface that displays command
names, options, prompts, and values right next to the crosshairs. (See
Chapter 2.)
 Improved object selection: AutoCAD provides more positive feedback
than ever before with its new rollover highlighting feature. (See Chapter 7.)
 Dynamic blocks: You no longer need separate blocks for every door or
window size in your drawings. Now you can insert a single block defini-
tion and choose its configuration as you insert it. (See Chapter 13.)
If you’re using any version prior to AutoCAD 2004, the new version definitely
is worth upgrading to. You’ll enjoy a slew of improvements, including a
cleaner, more functional interface (Chapter 2), smoother transitions between
view changes (Chapter 8), and many command enhancements (Chapter 7).
AutoCAD 2006 is a worthy new version. If you’ve been putting off upgrading,
and especially if you’ve been hanging out with an old version such as
AutoCAD 2000 or Release 14, this probably is a good time to take the plunge.

No Express service?
If your menu bar doesn’t include the Express
menu (see Figure 1-1), you should consider
installing the Express Tools from your AutoCAD
CD (AutoCAD LT does not include or support the
Express Tools). 
When you first install AutoCAD 2006, you
choose between a Typical or a Custom instal-
lation. If you choose Typical, the Express Tools
(and the 3D DWF Publish tool) are automati-
cally selected, and will be installed as long as
you don’t uncheck the options during setup. 
If you choose a Custom installation, the Express
Tools are not selected, but you can include 
them later in the installation by checking the
appropriate box. If you do not install the Express
Tools during initial setup, you will have to re-
run AutoCAD 2006’s installation routine. If you
haven’t installed AutoCAD yet, we strongly 
recommend that you choose the Typical instal-
lation option — or at least make sure the
Express Tools box is checked during a Custom
installation.

utoCAD 2006 is a full-fledged citizen of the Windows world, with tool-
bars, dialog boxes, right-click menus, a multiple-document interface,
and all the other trappings of a real Windows program. And it’s becoming
more and more Windows-like with each release. One of the last weird but
essential holdovers from the DOS days is the AutoCAD command line area.
The command line is still there, but in AutoCAD 2006, you’ll be much less
reliant on this “look down here — now look up here” method of interacting
with the program.
AutoCAD 2006, like the fanciest Detroit iron, bristles with heads-up display
features. The new version’s dynamic input system puts much of the command
line information right under your nose (or at least under your crosshairs).
And recently entered data is just a right-click away. 
Like the rest of the book, this chapter is written for someone who has used
other Windows programs but has little or no experience with AutoCAD. If
you’re experienced with recent versions of AutoCAD, some of this chapter is
old hat for you. You’ll have a head start with palettes and some of the new
status bar features. If you have used AutoCAD 2004 or 2005, this chapter will
help you when it comes to dynamic input, which is a new and strange feature.

AutoCAD Does Windows
Finding your way around AutoCAD 2006 can be an odd experience. You recog-
nize from other Windows applications much of the appearance and workings
of the program, such as its toolbars and pull-down menus, which you use for
entering commands or changing system settings. But other aspects of the
program’s appearance — and some of the ways in which you work with it —
are quite different from other Windows programs. You can, in many cases, 
tell the program what to do in at least four ways — pick a toolbar icon, pick
from the pull-down menus, type at the keyboard, or pick from the right-click
menus — none of which is necessarily the best method to use for every task.
The experience is much like that of having to act as several different charac-
ters in a play; you’re likely to forget your lines (whichever “you” you are at
the time!) every now and then.
As with other Windows programs, the menus at the top of the AutoCAD screen
enable you to access most of the program’s functions and are the easiest-to-
remember method of issuing commands. When you want to get real work
18
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Screen test yields high profile
The screen shots and descriptions in this 
chapter reflect the default configuration of
AutoCAD — that is, the way the screen looks if
you use the standard version of AutoCAD (not a
flavored version such as Architectural Desktop)
and haven’t messed with the display settings.
You can change the appearance of the screen
with settings on the Display tab of the Options
dialog box (choose Tools➪Options➪Display)
and by dragging toolbars and other screen com-
ponents.
The main change we’ve made is to configure
the drawing area background to be white
instead of black, because the figures in the book
show up better that way. On your system, 
you’ll probably want to leave your drawing area
background black because the normal range of
colors that appears in most drawings is easier
to see against a black background.
If you’re using a flavored version of AutoCAD, or
if someone has already changed your configu-
ration or added a third-party program to your
setup, your screen may look different than the
figures in this book. You can restore the default
configuration — including display settings —
with the Reset button on the Options dialog
box’s Profiles tab. (AutoCAD LT doesn’t include
the Profiles feature, so LT users are out of luck
here.) But before you click the Reset button,
consider whether the modified configuration
may be useful to someone in the future — 
like you! If so, first click the Add to List button 
to create a new profile. Enter a pithy name 
for the new profile, such as AutoCAD default.
Then select the new profile that you created,
click the Set Current button to make it the cur-
rent profile, and finally click the Reset button. 
In the future, you can switch between your
modified and default configurations with the Set
Current button.

done, you’ll need to combine the pull-down menus with other methods —
especially entering options at the keyboard or choosing them from the right-
click menus. We show you how throughout this book.
And They’re Off: AutoCAD’s 
Opening Screen
When you launch AutoCAD after first installing it, the opening screen, shown
in Figure 2-1, displays an arrangement of menus, toolbars, palettes, and a
new, blank drawing. You can close the Sheet Set Manager and Tool Palettes
for now — we describe how to turn them back on and how to use them later
in this chapter. (If you installed the Express Tools, as we describe at the end
of Chapter 1, you’ll also see a flock of small toolbars labeled ET. You can
safely close all these and use the Express pull-down menu to access all the
Express Tools.)

Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006

If you have a previous version of AutoCAD on your computer, AutoCAD 2006
will display a Migrate Settings dialog box the first time you run the program.
Unless you’re a competent AutoCAD user who is reading this book to find out
about the new features, we recommend that you uncheck all the Migrate
Settings options and start fresh.
Those well-washed Windows 
As shown in Figure 2-1, much of the AutoCAD screen is standard Windows
fare — title bars, a menu bar, toolbars, and a status bar.
A hierarchy of title bars
Like most Windows programs, AutoCAD has a title bar at the top of its program
window that reminds you which program you’re in (not that you’d ever mis-
take the AutoCAD window for, say, Microsoft Word!).
 At the right side of the title bar is the standard set of three Windows
control buttons: Minimize, Maximize/Restore, and Close.
 Each drawing window within the AutoCAD program window has its own
title bar. You use the control buttons on a drawing window’s title bar to
minimize, maximize/un-maximize, or close that drawing, not the entire
AutoCAD program.
As in other Windows programs, if you maximize a drawing’s window, it expands
to fill the entire drawing area. (AutoCAD 2006 starts with the drawing maxi-
mized in this way.) As shown in Figure 2-1, the drawing’s control buttons
move onto the menu bar, below the control buttons for the AutoCAD program
window; the drawing’s name appears in the AutoCAD title bar. To un-maximize
the drawing so that you can see any other drawings that you have open, click
the lower un-maximize button. The result is as shown in Figure 2-2: a separate
title bar for each drawing with the name and controls for that drawing.
20
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Hot-wiring the menu bar
Some standard tips and tricks for Windows are
especially useful in AutoCAD. Control-key short-
cuts for the most popular functions — Ctrl+S to
save, Ctrl+O to open a file, and Ctrl+P to print —
work the same way in AutoCAD as in most other
Windows programs. Use them!
Also worth exploring are the Alt-key shortcuts,
which are available for all menu choices, not
just the most popular ones. To fly around the
menus, just press and hold the Alt key and then
press the letters on your keyboard that corre-
spond to the underlined letters on the menu bar
and in the menu choices. To bring up the
SAVEAS command, for example, just press and
hold the Alt key, press F for File, and then press
A for Save As.

Making choices from the menu bar
The menu bar contains the names of all the primary menus in your version of
AutoCAD. As with any program that’s new to you, it’s worth spending a few
minutes perusing the menus in order to familiarize yourself with the com-
mands and their arrangement. (If your menu bar doesn’t include the Express
menu, see the end of Chapter 1 for installation instructions.)
Cruising the toolbars
As in other Windows programs, the toolbars in AutoCAD provide rapid
access to the most commonly used AutoCAD commands. AutoCAD 2006
ships with toolbars in this default arrangement (as shown in Figure 2-3):
 Standard toolbar: Located on top, just below the menu bar; file manage-
ment and other common Windows functions, plus some specialized
AutoCAD stuff such as zooming and panning.
 Styles toolbar: To the right of the Standard toolbar; analogous to the left
part of the Formatting toolbar in Microsoft programs, but formatting of
AutoCAD’s text, dimension, and table styles. Chapters 9 and 10 cover
these features.
 Layers toolbar: Beneath the Standard toolbar; commands and a drop-
down list for manipulating layers, which are AutoCAD’s fundamental
tools for organizing and formatting objects. Chapter 5 contains the layer
lowdown.
Figure 2-2:

maximized.
21
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006

 Properties toolbar: To the right of the Layers toolbar; analogous to the
right part of the Formatting toolbar in Microsoft programs, but formatting
of AutoCAD’s properties, such as colors, linetypes, and lineweights. See
Chapter 5 when you’re ready to play with AutoCAD’s object properties.
 Draw toolbar: Vertically down the far-left edge of the screen; the most
commonly used commands from the Draw menu. Chapter 6 covers most
of the items on this toolbar.
 Modify toolbar: Vertically down the far-right edge of the screen; the
most commonly used commands from the Modify menu. Chapter 7
shows you how to use almost everything on this toolbar.
 Draw Order toolbar: Beneath the Modify toolbar; commands for con-
trolling which objects appear on top of which other objects. Chapter 13
mentions these features.
You can rearrange, open, and close toolbars as in other Windows programs:
 To move a toolbar, point to its border (the double-line control handle at
the leading edge of the toolbar is the easiest part to grab), click, and drag.
 To open or close toolbars, right-click on any toolbar button and choose
from the list of available toolbars, as shown in Figure 2-3.
The AutoCAD screen in Figure 2-3 shows the default toolbar arrangement,
which works fine for most people. Feel free to close the Draw Order toolbar;
you aren’t likely to use its features frequently. You may want to turn on a
couple of additional toolbars, such as Object Snap and Dimension, as you dis-
cover and make use of additional features. Throughout this book, we point
out when a particular toolbar may be useful.
22
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
The toolbars that ET AutoCAD
If you’ve installed the Express Tools, you’ll also
see a flock of Express Tools toolbars, whose
labels begin with “ET:” floating over the draw-
ing area. These four small toolbars collect some
of the most popular Express Tools. You’ll proba-
bly want to close most of these or at least dock
any favorites along the margin of the AutoCAD
window.
The Express Tools are extensions to AutoCAD,
not part of the core program, so turning the 
toolbars on again after you’ve turned them off
requires one additional step. Right-click in an
empty part of one of the toolbar areas. A right-
click menu displays the names of the two
loaded menu files, ACAD and EXPRESS. The
ACAD list displays the names of all the regular
toolbars: Draw, Standard, and so forth. The
EXPRESS list displays the names of the four
Express Tools toolbars; click the check boxes
next to the names in order to toggle each tool-
bar on or off.

Toolbars and palettes can become hard to manage with a half-dozen or more
open. AutoCAD 2006 lets you lock toolbars and palettes in place — just click
the padlock on the far right of the status bar (see Figure 2-4) to keep your
toolbars and palettes parked. 
If you’re not satisfied with just rearranging the stock AutoCAD toolbars, you
can customize their contents or even create new ones. The procedures are
beyond the scope of this book; they involve bouncing among the Interfaces,
Commands, Toolbars, and Properties areas in the Customize User Interface
dialog box in not entirely intuitive ways. Resist slicing and dicing the stock
AutoCAD toolbars until you’re at least somewhat familiar with them. If you
want to get creative thereafter, go to the Contents tab of the AutoCAD 2006
online help and choose Customization Guide➪Basic Customization➪Customize
the User Interface➪Customize Toolbars.
AutoCAD toolbar buttons provide tooltips, those short text descriptions that
appear in little yellow boxes when you pause the cursor over a toolbar
button. A longer description of the icon’s function appears in the status bar
at the bottom of the screen.

Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006

Looking for Mr. Status Bar
The status bar appears at the bottom of the AutoCAD screen, as shown in
Figure 2-4. The status bar displays and allows you to change several impor-
tant settings that affect how you draw and edit in the current drawing. Some
of these settings won’t make complete sense until you’ve used the AutoCAD
commands that they influence, but here’s a brief description, with pointers to
detailed descriptions of how to use each setting elsewhere in this book:
 Coordinates of the cursor: The cursor coordinates readout displays the
current X,Y,Z location of the cursor in the drawing area, with respect to
the origin point (whose coordinates are 0,0,0). It’s a bit like having a GPS
(Global Positioning System) device in your drawing. Chapter 5 describes
AutoCAD’s coordinate conventions and how to use this area of the
status bar.
If the coordinates in the lower-left corner of the screen are grayed out,
then coordinate tracking is turned off. Click the coordinates so that they
appear in dark lettering that changes when you move the cursor in the
drawing area.
If dynamic input is enabled, the tooltip at the cursor also displays the
current X,Y,Z location of the cursor. This constantly active display is not
affected by changes to coordinate tracking in the status bar.
 SNAP, GRID, and ORTHO mode buttons: These three buttons control
three of AutoCAD’s tools for ensuring precision drawing and editing:
• Snap constrains the cursor to regularly spaced hot spots, enabling
you to draw objects a fixed distance apart more easily.
• Grid displays a series of regularly spaced dots, which serve as a
distance reference.
• Ortho constrains the cursor to horizontal and vertical relative
movement, which makes drawing orthogonal (straight horizontal
and vertical) lines easy.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 

See Chapter 4 for instructions on how to configure these modes and
Chapter 5 for information about why, when, and how to use them in
actual drawing operations.
 POLAR tracking mode button: Polar tracking causes the cursor to
prefer certain angles when you draw and edit objects. By default, the
preferred angles are multiples of 90 degrees, but you can specify other
angle increments, such as 45 or 30 degrees. See Chapter 5 for instruc-
tions to specify the polar tracking angles that you prefer. Clicking the
POLAR button toggles polar tracking on or off. Ortho and polar tracking
are mutually exclusive — turning on one mode disables the other.
 Running Object Snap (OSNAP) and Object Snap Tracking (OTRACK)
buttons: Object snap is another AutoCAD tool for ensuring precision
drawing and editing. You use object snaps to grab points on existing
objects — for example, the endpoint of a line or the center of a circle.
• When you turn on running object snap, AutoCAD continues to hunt
for object snap points. Chapter 5 contains detailed instructions on
how to use this feature.
• When you turn on object snap tracking, AutoCAD hunts in a more
sophisticated way for points that are derived from object snap
points. Chapter 5 briefly describes this advanced feature.
AutoCAD LT doesn’t include the object snap tracking feature, so you
won’t see an OTRACK button on its status bar.
 Dynamic Input (DYN) button: Dynamic input displays commands,
options, prompts, and user input adjacent to the crosshairs in the draw-
ing area and enables you to keep focused on what you’re drawing. In
addition, the dynamic input area displays what you type in response to
prompts. (If you get frustrated with this system, mind you don’t become
a dynamic curser yourself!)
 Lineweight (LWT) display mode button: One of the properties that you
can assign to objects in AutoCAD is lineweight — the thickness that lines
appear when you plot the drawing. This button controls whether you
see the lineweights on the screen. (This button doesn’t control whether
lineweights appear on plots; that’s a separate setting in the Plot dialog
box.) Chapter 5 gives you the skinny (and the wide) on lineweights.
 MODEL/PAPER space button: As we describe in the section, “Down the
main stretch: The drawing area,” later in this chapter, the drawing area
is composed of overlapping tabbed areas labeled Model, Layout1, and
Layout2 by default. The Model tab displays a part of the drawing called
model space, where you create most of your drawing. Each of the remain-
ing tabs displays a paper space layout, where you can compose a plotable
view with a title block. A completed layout will include one or more
viewports, which reveal some or all the objects in model space at a par-
ticular scale.
25
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006

The MODEL/PAPER status bar button (not to be confused with the
Model tab) comes into play after you click one of the paper space layout
tabs. The MODEL/PAPER button provides a means for moving the cursor
between model and paper space while remaining in the particular layout.
• When the MODEL/PAPER button says MODEL, drawing and editing
operations take place in model space, inside a viewport.
• When the button says PAPER, drawing and editing operations take
place in paper space on the current layout.
Don’t worry if you find model space and paper space a little disorienting
at first. The paper space layout setup information in Chapter 4 and plot-
ting instructions in Chapter 12 will help you get your bearings and navi-
gate with confidence.
 Maximize/Minimize Viewport button (paper space layouts only): When
you’re looking at one of the Layout tabs instead of the Model tab, the
status bar displays an additional Maximize Viewport button. Click this
button to expand the current paper space viewport so that it fills the
entire drawing area. Click the button — now called Minimize Viewport —
again to restore the viewport to its normal size. (Chapter 4 describes
viewports.)
 Communication Center: This button opens a dialog box containing
recent AutoCAD-related headlines that Autodesk thinks you may find
useful. The headlines are grouped into categories called channels: Live
Update Maintenance Patches, Articles and Tips, Product Support
Information, and so on. Each headline is a link to a Web page with more
information, such as how to download a software update or fix a prob-
lem. Click the Settings button to select channels you see in the
Communication Center window.
 Lock/Unlock Toolbar Palette Positions: “Now, where did I leave that
Properties palette?” You’ll never have to ask yourself again — AutoCAD
2006 lets you lock toolbars or palettes (which for some reason they’ve
started calling windows) in position so you’ll always know where they are.
 Manage Xrefs: You won’t see this combination button and notification
symbol until you open a drawing that contains xrefs (external DWG files
that are incorporated into the current drawing). Chapter 13 tells you
how to use xrefs and what the Manage Xrefs button does.
 Associated Standards File: You’ll see this button if you’ve enabled CAD
standards checking and configured a drawing standards (DWS) file.
Clicking this button displays the Check Standards dialog box. Chapter 15
tells you how to set up standards checking.
 Status Bar Menu: When you click the easy-to-miss downward-pointing
arrow near the right edge of the status bar, you open a menu with
options for toggling off or on each status bar button. Now you can deco-
rate your status bar to your taste.
26
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

You can open dialog boxes for configuring many of the status bar button
functions by right-clicking the status bar button and choosing Settings.
Chapters 4 and 5 give you specific guidance about when and how to change
these settings.
A button’s appearance shows whether the setting is turned on or off.
Depressed, or down, means on; raised, or up, means off. If you’re unclear
whether a setting is on or off, click its button; its mode will change and the
new setting will be reflected on the command line — <Osnap off>, for 
example. Click again to restore the previous setting.
A smoother ride: Dynamic input
One of the tasks faced by every AutoCAD instructor is the frequent need to
badger students to “Watch The Command Line!” because the command line
can be confusing for people who are new to CAD and computers. To anyone
familiar with any other Windows graphic program, the command line is really
tough to take — a throwback to an earlier time, when the knuckles of 
computer-aided drafters dragged on the ground. The challenge for experi-
enced AutoCAD users now is going to be “Stop Watching The Command Line!”
When dynamic input is enabled, the cursor takes on some extra features: 
 The coordinates of the current pointer location are always visible at 
the cursor. 
 Typed commands appear in the tooltip adjacent to the cursor. 
 When a command is started, you can display options by pressing the
down-arrow key on the keyboard. 
 Values that you type appear in the tooltip, and the dynamic input system
displays dimensions when you’re drawing things or moving them around
(refer to Figure 2-1). 
Dynamic input is enabled by default, so it’s going to be one of the first things
you notice when you get behind the wheel. 
The two elements of the dynamic input system are
 Dynamic Pointer: A coordinate display appears adjacent to the cursor
and updates as you move the pointer. Command options and input
appear in the pointer tooltip.
 Dynamic Dimensions: Distance and angular dimensions display and
constantly update as you move the cursor around the screen.
27
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006

If there’s not enough room at the cursor to show all command options, the
dynamic input tooltip shows a tiny down-arrow icon. Press the down-arrow
key on your keyboard to see more options (see Figure 2-5).
The new DYN status bar button controls AutoCAD 2006’s dynamic input
system. You can toggle off dynamic input by clicking this button, but we rec-
ommend you use it — you won’t have to keep looking down at the command
line nearly so often! 
Dynamic input looks like a great new feature, but it takes some getting used
to. For newcomers to AutoCAD, it’s still a confusing array of information to
deal with. For experienced users, the most disconcerting thing is to see the
command line remain blank as you type commands. 
Let your fingers do the talking: 
The command line area
If the title bars, menu bar, status bar, and dynamic input tooltips are 
the Windows equivalent of comfort food — familiar, nourishing, and 
unthreatening — then the command line area, shown in Figure 2-6, must be
the steak tartare or blood sausage of the AutoCAD screen feast. It looks
weird, turns the stomachs of newcomers, and delights AutoCAD aficionados.
Despite the promise of AutoCAD 2006’s heads-up dynamic input, for now at
least, the hard truth is that you have to come to like — or at least tolerate —
the command line if you want to become at all comfortable using AutoCAD. 
You should cotton on and cozy up to the command line because the com-
mand line is still AutoCAD’s primary communications conduit with you.
Figure 2-5:
Dynamic
cursor with
all the
options.
28
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

AutoCAD sometimes displays prompts, warnings, and error messages in the
command line area that dynamic input doesn’t show — there simply isn’t
room in the dynamic input tooltip to show as much information as you get at
the command line. True, when using dynamic input, you can press the down-
arrow key to see more options, but then which is less efficient — moving
your eyes down the screen to glance at the command line, or taking your
eyes right off the screen to find the down-arrow key on your keyboard? 
The key(board) to AutoCAD success
Despite (or is it because of?) AutoCAD’s long heritage as the most successful
microcomputer CAD software, newcomers are still astonished at the amount
of typing they have to do. Some more modern programs may have much less
dependency on the keyboard than AutoCAD, but as you get used to it, you’ll
find that no other input method gives you as much flexibility as pounding the
ivories . . . oops, wrong keyboard!
Typing at your computer’s keyboard is an efficient way to run some commands
and the only way to run a few others. Instead of clicking a toolbar button or a
menu choice, you can start a command by typing its command name and
then pressing the Enter key. Even better, for most common commands, you
can type the keyboard shortcut for a command name and press Enter. Most
of the keyboard shortcuts for command names are just one or two letters —
for example, L for the LINE command and CP for the COPY command. Most
people who discover how to use the shortcuts for the commands that they
run most frequently find that their AutoCAD productivity improves notice-
ably. Even if you’re not worried about increasing your productivity with this
technique, there are some commands that aren’t on the toolbars or pull-
down menus. If you want to run those commands, you have to type them! 
You also have to use the keyboard to feed some kinds of data to AutoCAD —
you still need to type coordinates, for example. However, dynamic input has
reduced many different kinds of typed data input to just a few. 
After you’ve started a command — whether from a toolbar, from a menu, or by
typing — the dynamic input cursor and the command line are where AutoCAD
prompts you with options for that command. You activate one of these
options by typing the uppercase letter(s) in the option and pressing Enter.
Figure 2-6:
Obey the
command
line.
29
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006

In many cases, you can activate a command’s options by right-clicking in the
drawing area and choosing the desired option from the menu that appears,
instead of by typing the letter(s) for the option and pressing Enter. 
The following sequence demonstrates how you use the keyboard to run com-
mands, and view and select options. Watch the command line and the dynamic
input tooltip (that is, the cursor), and pay attention to messages from AutoCAD.
1. Type L and press Enter.
AutoCAD starts the LINE command and displays the following prompt in
both the dynamic cursor and the command line area:
LINE Specify first point:
2. Click a point anywhere in the drawing area.
The cursor prompts you to specify the next point, and the command line
prompt changes to:
Specify next point or [Undo]:
3. Click another point anywhere in the drawing area.
AutoCAD draws the first line segment.
4. Click a third point anywhere in the drawing area.
AutoCAD draws the second line segment. The command line prompt
changes to:
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
AutoCAD’s dynamic cursor prompt ends in mid-sentence (AutoCAD has
always been grammatically challenged), but its arrow icon indicates that
there’s more. Press the down-arrow key on your keyboard to see the
hidden items. 
AutoCAD’s command line always displays command options in brackets.
In this case, the Undo option appears in brackets. To activate the option,
type the letter(s) shown in uppercase and press Enter. (You can type the
option letter(s) in lowercase or uppercase.)
The command line now displays two options, Close and Undo, separated
by a slash.
5. Type U and press Enter.
AutoCAD undoes the second line segment.
6. Type 3,2 (without any spaces) and press Enter.
AutoCAD draws a new line segment to the point whose X coordinate is 3
and Y coordinate is 2.
7. Click several more points anywhere in the drawing area.
AutoCAD draws additional line segments.
30
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

8. Type X and press Enter.
X isn’t a valid option of the Line command, so AutoCAD displays an
error message at both command line and dynamic cursor and prompts
you again for another point:
Point or option keyword required.
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
Option keyword is programmer jargon for the letter(s) shown in upper-
case that you type to activate a command option. This error message is
AutoCAD’s way of saying “I don’t understand what you mean by typing
X. Either specify a point or type a letter that I do understand.”
9. Type C and press Enter.
AutoCAD draws a final line segment, which creates a closed figure, and
ends the LINE command. The naked command prompt returns, indicat-
ing that AutoCAD is ready for the next command:
Command:
10. Press the F2 key.
AutoCAD displays the AutoCAD Text Window, which is simply an
enlarged, scrollable version of the command line area, as shown in
Figure 2-7.
The normal three-line command line area usually shows you what you
need to see, but occasionally you’ll want to review a larger chunk of com-
mand line history. (“What was AutoCAD trying to tell me a minute ago?!”)
11. Press the F2 key again.
AutoCAD closes the AutoCAD Text Window.
31
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006
AutoCAD is no vin ordinaire
The back and forth needed to get AutoCAD to
draw and complete a line is a great example of
AutoCAD’s power — and its power to confuse
new users. It’s kind of like a wine that tastes a
bit harsh initially, but that ages better than
something more immediately drinkable.
In other programs, if you want to draw a line,
you just draw it. In AutoCAD, you have to press
Enter one extra time when you’re done just to
tell AutoCAD you really are finished drawing.
But the fact that the Line command remains
active after you draw the first line segment
makes it much faster to draw complicated, 
multisegment lines, which is a common activity
in a complex drawing.
This is just one example of how AutoCAD favors
ease of use for power users doing complex
drawings over ease of mastery for beginners,
who frequently forget to hit Enter that extra time
to close out a command.

Here are a few other tips and tricks for effective keyboarding:
 Use the Esc key to bail out of the current operation. There will be times
when you get confused about what you’re doing in AutoCAD and/or
what you’re seeing in the command line area or the dynamic cursor. If
you need to bail out of the current operation, just press the Esc key one
or more times until you see the naked command prompt — Command: at
the bottom of the command line area, with nothing after it. As in most
other Windows programs, Esc is the cancel key. Unlike many other
Windows programs, AutoCAD keeps you well informed of whether an
operation is in progress. The naked command prompt indicates that
AutoCAD is in a quiescent state, waiting for your next command.
 Press Enter to accept the default action. Some command prompts
include a default action in angled brackets. For example, the first prompt
of the POLygon command is
Enter number of sides <4>:
The default here is four sides, and you can accept it simply by pressing
the Enter key. (That is, you don’t have to type 4 first.)
AutoCAD uses two kinds of brackets when it prompts:
• Command options appear in regular brackets: [Close/Undo].
Figure 2-7:
My how
you’ve
grown: F2
expands the
command
line area 
to a com-
mand text
window.
32
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

To activate a command option, type the letter(s) that appear in
uppercase and then press Enter. The dynamic cursor does not 
display options in brackets; instead, you press the down-arrow key
to display additional command options in rows next to the cursor
(refer to Figure 2-5).
• A Default value or option appears in angled brackets: <>.
To choose the default value or option, simply press Enter. Default
values in angled brackets appear in both the dynamic cursor and
the command line prompts.
 Observe the command line. You’ll discover a lot about how to use the
command line simply by watching it after each action that you take.
When you click a toolbar button or menu choice, AutoCAD types the
name of the command automatically, and displays it in the dynamic
cursor and at the command line. If you’re watching the command line,
you’ll absorb the command names more-or-less naturally.
When AutoCAD types commands automatically in response to your tool-
bar and menu clicks, it usually adds one or two extra characters to the
front of the command name.
• AutoCAD usually puts an underscore in front of the command
name (for example, _LINE instead of LINE). The underscore is an
Autodesk programmers’ trick that enables non-English versions of
AutoCAD to understand the English command names that are
embedded in the menus.
• AutoCAD sometimes puts an apostrophe in front of the command
name and any underscore (for example, ‘_ZOOM instead of ZOOM).
The apostrophe indicates a transparent command; you can run the
command in the middle of another command without canceling the
first command. For example, you can start the LINE command, run
the ZOOM command transparently, and then pick up where you
left off with the LINE command.
 Leave the command line in the default configuration initially. The
command line area, like most other parts of the AutoCAD screen, is
resizable and relocateable. The default location (docked at the bottom
of the AutoCAD screen) and size (three lines deep) work well for most
people. Resist the temptation to mess with the command line area’s
appearance — at least until you’re comfortable with how to use the com-
mand line.
 Right-click in the command line area for options. If you right-click in
the command line area, you’ll see a menu with some useful choices,
including Recent Commands — the last six commands that you ran.
 Press the up- and down-arrow keys to cycle through the stack of com-
mands that you’ve typed recently. This is another handy way to recall
and rerun a command. Press the left- and right-arrow keys to edit the
command line text that you’ve typed or recalled.
33
Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006

Down the main stretch: The drawing area
After all these screen hors d’oeuvres, you’re probably getting hungry for the
main course — the AutoCAD drawing area. This is where you do your draw-
ing, of course. In the course of creating drawings, you click points to specify
locations and distances, click objects to select them for editing, and zoom
and pan to get a better view of what you’re working on.
Most of this book shows you how to interact with the drawing area, but you
should know a few things up front.
The Model and Layout tabs (Model and paper space)
One of the initially disorienting things about AutoCAD is that finished draw-
ings can be composed of objects drawn in different spaces, which AutoCAD
indicates with the tabs along the bottom of the drawing area (Model,
Layout1, and Layout2 by default).
 Model space is where you create and modify the objects that represent
things in the real world — walls, widgets, waterways, or whatever.
 Paper space is where you create particular views of these objects for
plotting, usually with a title block around them. Paper space comprises
one or more layouts, each of which can contain a different arrangement
of model space views and different title block information.
When you click the Model tab in the drawing area, you see pure, unadulter-
ated model space, as shown in Figure 2-8. When you click one of the paper
space layout tabs (Layout1 or Layout2, unless someone has renamed or added
to them), you see a paper space layout, as shown in Figure 2-9. A completed
layout usually includes one or more viewports, which are windows that dis-
play all or part of model space at a particular scale. A layout also usually
includes a title block or other objects that exist only in the layout and don’t
appear when you click the Model tab. (Think of the viewport as a window
looking into model space and the title block as a frame around the window.)
Thus, a layout displays model space and paper space objects together, and
AutoCAD lets you draw and edit objects in either space. See Chapter 4 for
information about creating paper space layouts and Chapter 12 for the low-
down on plotting them.
As we describe in the “Looking for Mr. Status Bar” section in this chapter,
after you’ve clicked one of the layout tabs, the status bar’s MODEL/PAPER
button moves the cursor between model and paper space while remaining in
the particular layout. (As shown in Figures 2-8 and 2-9, the orientation icon at
the lower-left corner of the AutoCAD drawing area changes between an X-Y
axis for model space and a drafting triangle for paper space as an additional
reminder of which space the cursor currently resides in.) Chapter 4 describes
the consequences of changing the MODEL/PAPER setting and advises you on
how to use it.

Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2006

This back-and-forth with the MODEL/PAPER button or double-clicking is nec-
essary only when you’re drawing things while viewing one of the paper space
layouts or adjusting the view of the drawing objects within the viewport. In
practice, you probably won’t draw very much using this method. Instead,
you’ll do most of your drawing on the Model tab and, after you’ve set up a
paper space layout, click its layout tab only when you want to plot.
Drawing on the drawing area
Here are a few other things to know about the AutoCAD drawing area:
 Efficient, confident use of AutoCAD requires that you continually glance
from the drawing area to the command line area (to see those all-important
prompts!) and then back up to the drawing area. This sequence is not a
natural reflex for most people, and that’s why the dynamic input tooltip
cursor was introduced in AutoCAD 2006. But you still get information
from the command line that you don’t get anywhere else. Get in the habit
of looking at the command line after each action that you take, whether
picking something on a toolbar, on a menu, or in the drawing area.
 Clicking at random in the drawing area is not quite as harmless in
AutoCAD as it is in many other Windows programs. When you click in
the AutoCAD drawing area, you’re almost always performing some
action — usually specifying a point or selecting objects for editing. Feel
free to experiment, but look at the command line after each click. If you
get confused, press the Esc key a couple of times to clear the current
operation and return to the naked command prompt.
 In most cases, you can right-click in the drawing area to display a menu
with some options for the current situation.
Keeping Tabs on Palettes
Last time around (the pioneers call it AutoCAD 2005), two features called
Properties and DesignCenter, a toolbarlike interface called Tool Palettes, and
the new Sheet Set Manager appeared in spiffy modeless dialog boxes, or
palettes. This time, there are seven, including a brand new feature.
 Properties and DesignCenter: Used to control object properties and
named objects (layers, blocks, and so on), respectively. Chapter 5 shows
you how.
 Tool Palettes: Resembles a stack of painter’s palettes, except that each
palette holds content (drawing symbols and hatch patterns) and/or com-
mands (not regular AutoCAD commands — what would be the point? —
but macros that make commands do specific things) instead of paints.
Chapters 11, 13, and 15 help you unlock your inner Tool Palette artistry.
36
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

 Sheet Set Manager: Provides tools for managing all of a project’s draw-
ings as a sheet set. Chapter 14 gives you the lowdown on why you might
want to use sheet sets and how to do so. (AutoCAD LT does not support
sheet sets.)
 Markup Set Manager: Displays design and drafting review comments
from users of Autodesk DWF Composer. For more information on markup
sets, see the online help.
 Info Palette: Autodesk’s version of Mr Paperclip, the Info Palette pops
up with information about what you’re doing every step of the way. 
 QuickCalc: A handy pushbutton scientific calculator. You’ll know if you
need this.
You toggle these palettes on and off by clicking their respective buttons near
the right end of the Standard toolbar, or by pressing Ctrl+1 (Properties), Ctrl+2
(DesignCenter), Ctrl+3 (Tool Palettes), Ctrl+4 (Sheet Set Manager), Ctrl+5
(Info Palette), Ctrl+7 (Markup Set Manager), or Ctrl+8 (QuickCalc). Figure 2-10
shows some of these palettes toggled on.
Modeless is just a fancy way of saying that these dialog boxes don’t take over
AutoCAD in the way that modal dialog boxes do. Modal dialog boxes demand
your undivided attention. You enter values, click buttons, or whatever, and
then click the OK or Cancel button to close the dialog box. While the modal
dialog box is open, you can’t do anything else in AutoCAD. A modeless dialog
box, on the other hand, can remain open while you execute other commands
that have nothing to do with the dialog box. You return to the modeless
dialog box when or if you need its features.
Manipulating AutoCAD modeless dialog boxes — or palettes — is similar to
manipulating a regular Windows dialog box, except that the title bar is along
the side instead of at the top. Puts a whole new slant on things, doesn’t it?
In other words, you click and drag the title strip along the side to move the
palette. If you experiment with the control buttons at the bottom of this strip
(or right-click anywhere on the strip), you’ll quickly get the hang of what you
can do with these palettes. In particular, turning on the auto-hide feature
causes the dialog box to “roll up” into the strip so that it’s not taking up much
screen space. When you point the cursor at the strip, the palette unfurls again.
Another cool feature — for the Tool Palettes but not the Properties and Design-
Center palettes — is transparency. Right-click the Tool Palettes’ title strip and
choose Transparency to control this feature. With transparency turned on, you
can see your drawing objects behind a faded version of the Tool Palettes. If
you combine transparency with auto-hide, you end up with Tool Palettes that
have a low impact on your drawing area. And if you’re bothered by the amount
of screen space taken by the command line area, you can make it transparent,
too: Undock it, right-click the title bar and turn off Allow Docking, and then
right-click again and choose Transparency. After you’ve set the transparency
to your taste, click and drag the command line area to where you want it.

Driving Miss AutoCAD
Knowing how to read the command line, as described in the section, “Let
your fingers do the talking: The command line area,” is one of the secrets of
becoming a competent AutoCAD user. In reading about and using AutoCAD,
you encounter two additional topics frequently: system variables, which are
AutoCAD’s basic control levers, and dialog boxes, many of which put a friend-
lier face on the system variables.
Under the hood: System variables
System variables are settings that AutoCAD checks before it decides how to
do something. If you set the system variable SAVETIME to 10, AutoCAD auto-
matically saves your drawing file every ten minutes; if you set SAVETIME to
60, the time between saves is one hour. Hundreds of system variables control
AutoCAD’s operations.
Properties palette
DesignCenter palette
Tool palettes
Sheet Set manager
Figure 2-10:

38
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Of these hundreds of system variables in AutoCAD, 70 system variables con-
trol dimensioning alone. (Dimensioning is the process of labeling objects with
their lengths, angles, or special notes. Different professions have different
standards for presenting dimensions on their drawings. Using dimensions is
described in detail in Chapter 10.)
To change the value of a system variable, just type its name at the AutoCAD
command prompt and press Enter. AutoCAD will display the current value of
the system variable setting and prompt you for a new value. Press Enter
alone to keep the existing setting, or type a value and press Enter to change
the setting.
The procedure for entering a system variable is exactly the same as for enter-
ing a command name — type the name and press Enter. The only difference is
what happens afterward:
 A system variable changes a setting.
 A command usually adds objects to the drawing, modifies objects, or
changes your view of the drawing.
Being able to change system variables by typing their names is a boon to
power users and occasionally a necessity for everybody else. The only prob-
lem is finding or remembering what the names are. In most cases, you’ll be
told what system variable name you need to type — by us in this book or by
the local AutoCAD guru in your office.
To see a listing of all the system variables in AutoCAD and their current set-
tings, use the following steps:
1. Type SETvar and press Enter.
AutoCAD prompts you to type the name of a system variable (if you
want to view or change just one) or question mark (if you want to see
the names and current settings of more than one):
Enter variable name or [?]
2. Type ? (question mark) and press Enter.
AutoCAD asks which system variables to list:
Enter variable(s) to list <*>:
3. Press Enter to accept the default asterisk (which means “list all system
variables”).
AutoCAD opens a text window and displays the first group of system
variables and their settings:

If you want to find out more about what a particular system variable controls,
see the System Variables chapter in the Command Reference in the AutoCAD
online help.
The three kinds of system variables are
 Those saved in the Windows Registry. If you change this kind of system
variable, it affects all drawings when you open them with AutoCAD on
your system.
 Those saved in the drawing. If you change this kind, the change affects
only the current drawing.
 Those that aren’t saved anywhere. If you change this kind, the change
lasts only for the current drawing session.
40
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

The System Variables chapter in the online Command Reference tells you
which kind of system variable each one is.
Chrome and gloss: Dialog boxes
Fortunately, you don’t usually have to remember the system variable names.
AutoCAD exposes most of the system variable settings in dialog boxes so that
you can change their values simply by clicking check boxes or typing values
in edit boxes. This approach is a lot more user friendly than remembering an
obscure name like “ACADLSPASDOC.”
For example, many of the settings on the tabs in the Options dialog box,
shown in Figure 2-11, are in fact system variables. If you use the dialog box
quick help (click the question mark in the Options dialog box’s title bar, and
then click an option in the dialog box), the pop-up description not only
describes the setting, but also tells which system variable it corresponds to.

The AutoCAD 2006 Help menu, shown in Figure 2-12, offers a slew of online
help options. We describe most of them here:

 Help: The main AutoCAD 2006 online help system, shown in Figure 2-13,
uses the same help engine as the Microsoft Office programs, Internet
Explorer, and other modern Windows applications. As with these other
programs, AutoCAD’s help is context-sensitive; for example, if you start
the LINE command and just don’t know what to do next, Help will . . . er,
help. Click the Contents tab to browse through the various online refer-
ence manuals, the Index tab to look up commands and concepts, and
the Search tab to look for specific words. In this book, we sometimes
direct you to the AutoCAD online help system for information about
advanced topics.
 Info Palette: This option opens a Quick Help Info Palette, which is the
Autodesk version of the Microsoft paper clip guy who tries to tell you
what to do in Word or Excel at each step along the way. Like paper clip
guy, Info Palette seems helpful — for 30 seconds. Then you get tired of
the distraction and the wasted screen space.

Chapter 3
A Lap around the CAD Track
In This Chapter
 Setting up a simple drawing
 Drawing some objects
 Zooming and panning in your drawing
 Editing some objects
 Plotting your drawing
T
he previous two chapters introduce you to the AutoCAD world and the
AutoCAD interface. The next chapters present the properties and tech-
niques that underlie good drafting practice. By now you’re probably eager to
start moving the cursor around and draw something! This chapter takes you
on a gentle tour of the most common CAD drafting functions: setting up a
new drawing, drawing some objects, editing those objects, zooming and pan-
ning so that you can view those objects better, and plotting the drawing.
Most of the stuff in this chapter will be mysterious to you. Don’t worry — we
tell you where to look for more information on specific topics. But in this
chapter, you’re simply taking AutoCAD out for a test drive to get a taste of
what it can do.
In this chapter, you create a drawing of an architectural detail — a base plate
and column, shown in Figure 3-1. Even if you don’t work in architecture or
building, this exercise gives you some simple shapes to work with and demon-
strates commands you can use. And who knows — if the CAD thing doesn’t
work out, at the very least you’ll know how to put your best footing forward.
Although the drafting example in this chapter is simple, the procedures that
it demonstrates are real, honest-to-CADness, proper drafting practice. We
emphasize from the beginning the importance of proper drawing setup, putting
objects on appropriate layers, and drawing and editing with due concern for
precision. Some of the steps in this chapter may seem a bit complicated at
first, but they reflect the way that experienced AutoCAD users work. Our goal
is to help you develop good CAD habits and do things the right way from the
very start.

The step-by-step procedures in this chapter, unlike those in most chapters of
this book, form a sequence. You must do the steps in order. It’s like learning
to drive, except that here you’re free to stop in the middle of the trip and take
a break.
If you find that object selection or editing functions work differently from
how we describe them in this chapter, you or someone else probably
changed the configuration settings on the Option dialog box’s Selection tab.
Chapter 7 describes these settings and how to restore the AutoCAD defaults.
A Simple Setup
During the remainder of this chapter, we walk you through creating, editing,
viewing, and plotting a new drawing — refer to Figure 3-1 if you want to get an
idea of what the goal looks like.
As Chapter 2 advises, make sure that you pay attention to AutoCAD’s feed-
back. Glance at the dynamic input tooltip and especially the command line
area after each step so that you see the messages that AutoCAD is sending
your way and so that you begin to get familiar with the names of commands
and their options.
Figure 3-1:

Part I: AutoCAD 101 

In this first set of steps, you create a new drawing from a template, change
some settings to establish a 1:10 (1 to 10) scale, and save the drawing. As we
describe in Chapter 4, drawing setup is not a simple task in AutoCAD.
Nonetheless, drawing setup is an important part of the job, and if you don’t
get in the habit of doing it right, you run into endless problems later on —
especially when you try to plot. (See Chapter 12 for the low-down on plotting
your drawings.)
1. Start AutoCAD by double-clicking its shortcut on the Windows desktop.
If you don’t have an AutoCAD shortcut on your desktop, choose Start➪
All Programs (Programs in Windows 2000)➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2006➪
AutoCAD 2006.
The main AutoCAD screen appears with a new, blank drawing in it.
2. If any palettes such as the Tool Palettes or Sheet Set Manager appear,
close them.
3. Choose File➪New.
The Select Template dialog box appears with a list of drawing templates
(DWT files), which you can use as the starting point for new drawings.
Chapter 4 describes how to create and use drawing templates.
4. Select the acad.dwt template, as shown in Figure 3-2, and click the
Open button (for AutoCAD LT, select aclt.dwt).
AutoCAD creates a new, blank drawing with the settings in acad.dwt.
acad.dwt is AutoCAD’s default, “plain Jane” drawing template for draw-
ings in imperial units (that is, units expressed in inches and/or feet).
acadiso.dwt (acltiso.dwt in AutoCAD LT) is the corresponding draw-
ing template for drawings created in metric units. Chapter 4 contains
additional information about these and other templates.
Figure 3-2:

a new

Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

5. Choose Format➪Drawing Limits.
Drawing limits define your working area. AutoCAD prompts you to reset
the Model space limits. The command line reads:
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.0000,0.0000>:
6. Press Enter to keep 0,0 as the lower-left corner value.
AutoCAD prompts for the upper-right corner. The command line reads:
Specify upper right corner <12.0000,9.0000>:
7. Type 100,75 (no spaces) and press Enter.
The values you enter appear in the dynamic input tooltip and the com-
mand line.
100 x 75 corresponds to 10 inches by 7.5 inches (a little smaller than an
8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper turned on its long side) times a drawing
scale factor of 10 (because you’re eventually going to plot at 1:10 scale).
See Chapter 4 for more information about drawing scales.
8. Right-click the SNAP button on the AutoCAD status bar and choose
Settings.
The Snap and Grid tab of the Drafting Settings dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 3-3.
9. Change the values in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-3: Snap On
checked, Grid On checked, Snap X Spacing and Snap Y Spacing set to
0.5, and Grid X Spacing and Grid Y Spacing set to 5.
(When you change the X spacings, the Y spacings automatically update
to the same number, which saves you typing.)
Figure 3-3:
Snap and
Grid
settings.
48
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Snap constrains your cursor to moving in an invisible grid of equally
spaced points (0.5 units apart in this case). Grid displays a visible grid of
little dots on the screen (5 units apart in this case), which you can use
as reference points. The grid doesn’t appear on printed drawings.
10. Click OK.
You see some grid dots, 5 units apart, in the drawing area. If you move
your mouse around and watch the dynamic input tooltip at the cursor,
or the coordinate display area on the status bar, you notice that it
moves in 0.5-unit jumps.
11. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
AutoCAD zooms out so that the entire area defined by the limits — as
indicated by the grid dots — is visible. 
12. Click the Save button on the Standard toolbar or press Ctrl+S.
Because you haven’t saved the drawing yet, AutoCAD opens the Save
Drawing As dialog box. 
13. Navigate to a suitable folder by choosing from the Save In drop-down
list and/or double-clicking folders in the list of folders below it.
14. Type a name in the File Name edit box.
For example, type Detail or My Plate is Base.
Depending on your Windows Explorer settings, you may or may not see
the .dwg extension in the File Name edit box. In any case, you don’t
need to type it. AutoCAD adds it for you.
15. Click the Save button.
AutoCAD saves the new DWG file to the folder that you specify.
Whew — that was more work than digging a post hole — and all just to set up
a simple drawing! Chapter 4 goes into more detail about drawing setup and
describes why all these gyrations are necessary.
Drawing a (Base) Plate
With a properly set up drawing, you’re ready to draw some objects. In this
example, you use the RECtang command to draw a steel base plate and
column, the Circle command to draw an anchor bolt, and the POLygon com-
mand to draw a hexagonal nut. (Both the RECtang and POLygon commands
create polylines — objects that contain a series of straight-line segments
and/or arc segments.)
49
Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

AutoCAD, like most CAD programs, uses layers as an organizing principle for
all the objects that you draw. Chapter 5 describes layers and other object
properties in detail. In this example, you create separate layers for the base
plate, the column, and the anchor bolts, which may seem like layer madness.
But when doing complex drawings, you need to use a lot of layers in order to
keep things organized.
Rectangles on the right layers
The following steps demonstrate how to create and use layers, as well as how
to draw rectangles. You also see how to apply fillets to objects and offset
them. (Chapter 5 describes layers in detail and Chapter 6 covers the RECtang
command. Chapter 7 explains the FILLET and OFFSET commands.) Start by
creating a Column layer and a Plate layer, and then drawing a column on the
Column layer and drawing square base plate on the Plate layer by following
these steps: 
1. Make sure that you complete the drawing setup in the previous sec-
tion of this chapter.
2. Click the Layer button on the Layers toolbar.
The LAyer command starts and AutoCAD displays the Layer Properties
Manager dialog box.
3. Click the New Layer button.
AutoCAD adds a new layer to the list and gives it the default name
Layer1.
4. Type a more suitable name for the layer on which you’ll draw the
column and press Enter.
In this example, type Column, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4:
Creating a
new layer.
50
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

5. Click the color swatch or name (“White”) in the Column layer row.
The Select Color dialog box appears.
6. Click color 5 (blue) in the single, separate row to the left of the
ByLayer and ByBlock buttons, and then click OK.
The Standard Colors dialog box closes and AutoCAD changes the color
of the Column layer to blue.
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 to create a new layer named Plate, and set
its color to 4 (cyan).
8. With layer Plate still highlighted, click the Set Current button (the
green check mark).
Plate becomes the current layer — that is, the layer on which AutoCAD
places objects that you draw from this point forward.
9. Click OK to close the Layer Properties Manager dialog box.
The Layer drop-down list on the Layers toolbar displays Plate as the cur-
rent layer.
Now you can draw a rectangular plate on the Plate layer.
10. Click the Rectangle button on the Draw toolbar.
The RECtang command starts and AutoCAD prompts you to specify the
first corner point. The command line shows:
Specify first corner point or
[Chamfer/Elevation/Fillet/Thickness/Width]:
11. Click in the drawing area at the point 20,20.
By watching the coordinate display on the dynamic input tooltip, you
can see the coordinates of the current cursor location. Because snap is
set to 0.5 units, you can land right on the point 20,20. Picking the point
20,20 gives you enough room to work.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the other corner point. The icon in the
dynamic input tooltip indicates this command has options you can set,
and they appear at the command line:
Specify other corner point or [Area/Dimensions/Rotation]:
12. Type @36,36 (without any spaces) and press Enter.
The @ sign indicates that you’re using a relative coordinate — that is, 36
units to the right and up from the point that you picked in the previous
step. See Chapter 5 for more information about typing absolute and rela-
tive coordinates.
AutoCAD draws the 36 x 36 rectangle, as shown in Figure 3-5. It’s on the
Plate layer and inherits that layer’s cyan color.
51
Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

You draw the column next, but first you have to change layers.
13. Click the Layer drop-down list on the Layers toolbar to display the list
of layers. Click Column to set it as the current layer.
14. Press Enter to repeat the RECtang command.
You can repeat the last command at any time by pressing Enter. In the
next steps, you create a hollow steel column.
15. At the Specify first corner prompt, type 32,29 and press Enter.
16. At the Specify other corner point prompt, type @12,18 and press Enter.
A second rectangle is drawn in the middle of the base plate. Next, you
round the corners of the column with the FILLET command, and then
use OFFSET to give it some thickness.
17. Click the Fillet button on the Modify toolbar.
The FILLET command starts, and AutoCAD prompts to select the first
object. The dynamic input tooltip icon is a reminder to look at the com-
mand prompt to see the options for this command. Apply a 2" radius
fillet to all four corners as follows.
Figure 3-5:
Your (base)
plate is
empty.
52
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

18. Type R and press Enter to set a new fillet radius. Type 2 and press
Enter.
AutoCAD next prompts to select the first object. You could pick each of
the eight lines that need to be filleted, but because the base plate is a
continuous polyline, a more efficient method in this case is to use the
FILLET command’s Polyline option to fillet both ends of all four segments.
19. Type P to choose the Polyline option.
AutoCAD prompts to select a 2D polyline.
20. Select the last rectangle and press Enter.
All four corners of the column are rounded with a 2" radius fillet.
Next, offset the polyline to create a 3⁄4" thick steel column.
21. Click the Offset button on the Modify toolbar.
22. At the Specify offset distance prompt, type .75 and press Enter.
23. At the Select object to offset prompt, click the rounded rectangle. At
the Specify point on side to offset prompt, click anywhere inside the
rectangle. Press Enter to complete the command.
AutoCAD offsets the selected object toward the side where you picked.
24. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
AutoCAD saves the drawing and renames the previously saved version
drawingname.bak — for example, My Plate is Base.bak. .bak is
AutoCAD’s extension for a backup file; Chapter 17 describes BAK files
and how to use them.
Circling your plate
You can use the Circle command to draw a 11⁄2-inch diameter anchor bolt on
the Anchor Bolts layer by following these steps:
1. Repeat Steps 2 through 6 in the previous section to create a new layer
for the anchor bolts and set it current. Give the layer the name
Anchor Bolts and assign it the color 3 (green).
The Layer drop-down list on the Layers toolbar displays Anchor Bolts as
the current layer. 
2. Click the Circle button on the Draw toolbar.
The Circle command starts and AutoCAD prompts you to specify the
center point. The command line shows:
53
Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan 
radius)]:
3. Click in the drawing area at point 26,26.
AutoCAD asks you to specify the size of the circle. The command line
shows:
Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]:
You decide that you want 11⁄2-inch diameter anchor bolts. AutoCAD is
asking for a radius. Although you probably can figure out the radius of 
a 11⁄2-inch circle, specify the Diameter option and let AutoCAD do the
hard work.
The icon on the dynamic input tooltip is a reminder to look at the com-
mand line to see what options are available.
4. Type D and press Enter to select the Diameter option.
AutoCAD prompts you at the command line:
Specify diameter of circle:
5. Type 1.5 and press Enter.
AutoCAD draws the 11⁄2-inch diameter circle. It’s on the Anchor Bolts
layer and inherits that layer’s green color.
6. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
Place your polygon
Every good bolt deserves a nut. Use the POLygon command to draw a hexag-
onal shape on the Nuts layer (well, what else would you call it?). Besides
showing you how to draw polygons, these steps introduce you to a couple of
AutoCAD’s more useful precision techniques: object snaps and ortho.
1. Repeat Steps 2 through 6 in the “Rectangles on the right layers” sec-
tion’s steps to create a new layer for the nuts and set it current. Give
the layer the name Nuts and assign it the color 1 (red).
The Layer drop-down list on the Layers toolbar displays Nuts as the 
current layer. 
You don’t have to create a separate layer for every type of object that
you draw. For example, you can draw both the anchor bolts and nuts on
a layer called Hardware. Layer names and usage depend on industry and
office practices, in addition to a certain amount of individual judgment.
If you end up with too many layers, however, lumping two layers together
is much easier than dividing the objects on one layer into two layers, if
you end up with too few.
2. Click the Polygon button — the one that looks like a plan of the
Pentagon — on the Draw toolbar.
54
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

The POLygon command starts and AutoCAD prompts:
Enter number of sides: <4>
Peek ahead to Figure 3-6 in order to get an idea of how the nut will look
after you draw it. Five-sided nuts can be a little difficult to adjust in the
real world, so we’ll stick with the conventional hexagonal sort.
3. Type 6 and press Enter.
AutoCAD next prompts you for the center of the polygon:
Specify center of polygon or: 
As you move the cursor around near the anchor bolt, notice that
AutoCAD tends to grab certain points briefly, especially on existing
objects. This behavior is the result of running object snaps and tracking,
which we discuss in Chapter 5. 
4. Move the mouse pointer close to the anchor bolt you just drew.
A tooltip should show “Center” and pull the cursor to the center of the
anchor bolt circle. If you’re using the full version of AutoCAD (not LT),
you may also see tracking vectors across the screen from this point —
you can ignore those.
5. Click when the tooltip reads Center — not Center-Intersection or
something similar — just Center.
The POLygon command draws regular closed polygons based on an
imaginary circle; the center of this circle is the point you just picked.
AutoCAD prompts:
Enter an option [Inscribed in circle/Circumscribed about
circle]:
6. Type I and press Enter to accept the Inscribed in circle option.
The Inscribed option draws a polygon whose corners touch the circum-
ference of the imaginary circle. The Circumscribed option draws a poly-
gon whose sides are tangent to the circumference of the circle.
Specify radius of circle: 
7. Turn on Ortho mode by clicking the ORTHO button on the status bar
until it looks popped in and you see <Ortho on> on the command line.
Drag the mouse to the right so the top and bottom sides of the polygon
are horizontal, but don’t click yet.
8. Type 1.5 and press Enter.
AutoCAD draws the nut, as shown in Figure 3-6. It’s on the Nuts layer and
inherits that layer’s red color.
Occasionally, Ortho and running object snaps interfere with drafting 
in AutoCAD. You can disable both features by clicking their status bar
buttons.
55
Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

9. Turn off Ortho mode and running object snaps by clicking the ORTHO
and OSNAP buttons on the status bar until they look popped out and
you see <Ortho off> and <Osnap off> on the command line.
10. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
Not much of a base plate yet, is it? But don’t worry — we cover creating more
nuts and bolts with editing commands later in this chapter. If your brain is
feeling full, now is a good time to take a break and go look out the window. If
you exit AutoCAD, just restart the program and reopen your drawing when
you’re ready to continue.
Get a Closer Look with Zoom and Pan
The example drawing in this chapter is pretty uncluttered and small, but most
real CAD drawings are neither. Technical drawings usually are jam-packed
with lines, text, and dimensions. CAD drawings often get plotted on sheets of
paper that measure two to three feet on a side — that’s in the hundreds of
millimeters, for you metric mavens. Anyone who owns a monitor that large
probably can afford to hire a whole room of drafters and therefore isn’t read-
ing this book. The rest of us need to zoom and pan in our drawings — a lot.
Zooming and panning frequently enables you to see the details better, draw

56
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

more confidently (because you can see what you’re doing), and edit more
quickly (because object selection is easier when a zillion objects aren’t on
the screen).
Fortunately, zooming and panning in AutoCAD is as simple as it is necessary.
The following steps describe how to use AutoCAD’s Zoom and Pan Realtime
feature, which is pretty easy to operate and provides a lot of flexibility.
Chapter 8 covers additional zoom and pan options.
To zoom and pan in your drawing, follow these steps:
1. Click the Zoom Realtime button (the one that looks like a magnifying
glass with a plus/minus sign next to it) on the Standard toolbar.
The Realtime option of the Zoom command starts. The cursor changes
to a magnifying glass and AutoCAD prompts you at the command line:
Press ESC or ENTER to exit, or right-click to display
shortcut menu.
2. Move the cursor near the middle of the screen, press and hold the left
mouse button, and drag the cursor up and down until the plate almost
fills the screen.
As you can see, dragging up increases the zoom magnification and drag-
ging down decreases it.
3. Right-click in the drawing area to display the Zoom/Pan Realtime
menu, shown in Figure 3-7, and choose Pan from the menu.
Figure 3-7:

57
Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

The cursor changes to a hand.
4. Click and drag to pan the drawing until the plate is more or less cen-
tered in the drawing area.
You can use the right-click menu to toggle back and forth between Zoom
and Pan as many times as you like. If you get lost, choose Zoom Original
or Zoom Extents in order to return to a recognizable view. 
5. Right-click in the drawing area and choose Exit from the Zoom/Pan
Realtime menu.
The cursor returns to the normal AutoCAD crosshairs.
Modify to Make It Merrier
When you have a better view of your base plate, you can edit the objects on
it more easily. In the following sections, you use the ARray command to add
more anchor bolts, the Stretch command to change the shape of the plate,
and the Hatch command to add crosshatching to the column.
Hooray for array
Using the ARray command is a great way to generate a bunch of new objects
at regular spacings from existing objects. The array pattern can be either rec-
tangular (that is, columns and rows of objects) or polar (in a circle around a
center point, like the spokes of a wheel around its hub). In this example, you
use rectangular array to create three additional anchor bolts:
1. Click the Array button — the one with four squares — on the Modify
toolbar.
The ARray command starts and AutoCAD displays the Array dialog box.
2. Click the Rectangular Array button.
3. Click the Select Objects button.
The standard AutoCAD object selection and editing sequence — start a
command and then select objects — may seem backward to you until
you get used to it. See Chapter 7 for more information.
The Array dialog box temporarily disappears and AutoCAD prompts you
to select objects.
4. Turn off Snap mode by clicking the SNAP button on the status bar
until it looks popped out and you see <Snap off> on the command line.
Turning off Snap mode temporarily makes selecting objects easier.
58
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

5. Click the anchor bolt and then click the nut.
If you encounter any problems while trying to select objects, press the
Esc key a couple of times to cancel the command, and then restart 
the ARray command. Chapter 7 describes AutoCAD object selection
techniques.
AutoCAD continues to prompt you at the command line:
Select objects: 1 found, 2 total
6. Press Enter to end object selection.
The Array dialog box reappears.
7. Click inside the Rows text box and set the value to 2. Press Tab to
move to the Columns Text box and set the value to 2.
The source object is counted in AutoCAD arrays. The preview shows
you’ve set up a rectangular array of four evenly spaced objects (see
Figure 3-8).
8. In the Row Offset text box, type 24. Click inside the Column Offset
text box and type 24.
9. Click the Preview button.
AutoCAD shows you what the array will look like if you accept the cur-
rent settings and displays a small dialog box with Accept, Modify, and
Cancel buttons.
10. If anything looks wrong, click the Modify button, make changes, and
preview again. When everything looks right, click the Accept button.
AutoCAD adds the additional objects to the drawing, as shown in 
Figure 3-9.

11. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
Perfect! Except that nutbar engineer has decided the column needs to be 18 x
18" instead of 12 x 18". And that means the base plate is too small, and the
anchor bolts are in the wrong place, too. If you were working on the drawing
board, you’d be getting out an eraser and rubbing out all your efforts.
AutoCAD to the rescue!
Stretch out
The Stretch command is powerful but a little bit complicated — it can stretch
or move objects, depending on how you select them. The key to using Stretch
is specifying a crossing selection box properly. (Chapter 7 gives you more
details about crossing boxes and how to use them with the Stretch command.)
Follow these steps to stretch the column and base plate:
1. Click the Stretch button — the one with the corner of the rectangle
being stretched — on the Modify toolbar.
The Stretch command starts and AutoCAD prompts you to select objects.
This is one of those times (and one of those commands) that really do
require you to look at the command line:
Figure 3-9:
Buttoned-
down base

60
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Select objects to stretch by crossing-window or crossing-
polygon...
Select objects: 
2. Click a point above and to the right of the upper-right corner of the
plate (Point 1 in Figure 3-10).
3. Move the cursor to the left.
The cursor changes to a dashed rectangle enclosing a rectangular red
area, which indicates that you’re specifying a crossing box. AutoCAD
prompts you at the command line:
Select objects: Specify opposite corner: 
4. Click a point below the plate, roughly through the center of the
column (Point 2 in Figure 3-10). 
The crossing box needs to cut through the plate and column in order for
the Stretch command to work (refer to Figure 3-10).
AutoCAD prompts you at the command line:
Select objects: Specify opposite corner: 7 found
Select objects:
Point 1
Point 2

5. Press Enter to end object selection.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the base point.
6. Turn on Snap mode, Ortho mode, and running object snap mode by
clicking the SNAP, ORTHO, and OSNAP buttons on the status bar until
they appear pushed in.
7. Click the lower-right corner of the plate.
This point serves as the base point for the stretch operation. Chapter 7
describes base points and displacements in greater detail.
AutoCAD prompts you at the command line:
Specify second point of displacement or <use first point
as displacement>:
8. Move the cursor to the right until the dynamic input tooltip shows a
displacement of 6 units to the right, and then click (see Figure 3-11).
AutoCAD stretches the column and plate by the distance that you indi-
cate and moves the anchor bolts that were completely inside the cross-
ing window rectangle, as shown in Figure 3-11.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 

If your first stretch didn’t work right, click the Undo button on the Stand-
ard toolbar and try again. Stretch is an immensely useful command —
one that makes you wonder how drafters used to do it all with erasers
and pencils — but it does take some practice to get the hang of those
crossing boxes.
9. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
Cross your hatches
Your final editing task is to add some crosshatching to the space between the
inside and outside edges of the column to indicate that the drawing shows a
section of the column. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Turn off Snap and running object snaps by clicking the SNAP and
OSNAP buttons on the status bar until they look popped out.
2. Repeat Steps 2 through 6 in the “Rectangles on the right layer” section
to create a new layer named Hatch. Set its color to 2 (yellow), and
make it the current layer.
3. Click the Hatch button — the one that shows a diagonal line pattern
inside four lines — on the Draw toolbar.
The Hatch and Gradient dialog box appears. In the right side of the
dialog box, click Add Pick points. The dialog box temporarily closes.
4. At the Pick internal point prompt, pick a point between the inside and
outside edges of the column. Zoom in if you need to get closer.
AutoCAD selects the two filleted polylines.
5. Press Enter to end object selection.
The Hatch and Gradient dialog box reappears. To check if the hatch
parameters are correct, click the Preview button. 
Looks like the hatch pattern is too fine.
6. Press Esc to return to the Hatch and Gradient dialog box.
7. In the Scale box, set the value to 5. Click Preview again. If it looks
okay, right-click to accept the hatch pattern.
Your finished column and base plate should look like Figure 3-12.
8. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
AutoCAD zooms out so that the entire area defined by the limits is 
visible. 
9. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.

Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

After some drawing and editing, you may wonder how you’re supposed to
know when to turn off or on the various status bar modes (Snap, Grid, Ortho,
Osnap, and so on). You will start to get an instinctive sense of when each
mode is useful and when it gets in the way. In subsequent chapters of this
book, we give you some more specific guidelines.
Follow the Plot
Looking at drawings on a computer screen and exchanging them with others
via e-mail or Web sites is all well and good. But sooner or later, someone —
maybe you! — is going to want to see a printed version. Printing drawings —
or plotting, as CAD geeks like to call it — is much more complicated than
printing a word processing document or a spreadsheet. That’s because you
have to worry about things such as drawing scale, lineweights, title blocks,
and weird paper sizes. We get into plotting in Chapter 12, but here’s an abbre-
viated procedure that helps you generate a recognizable printed drawing.
The following steps show you how to plot the model space portion of the
drawing. As Chapter 4 describes, AutoCAD includes a sophisticated feature
called paper space layouts for creating arrangements of your drawing that you
Figure 3-12:
Our column
is hatched.
64
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

plot. These arrangements usually include a title block. Because we promised
you a gentle tour of AutoCAD drafting functions, we left the paper space
layout and title block issues for the next chapter. When you’re ready for the
whole plotting enchilada, turn to Chapter 4 for information about how to set
up paper space layouts and Chapter 12 for full plotting instructions.
Follow these steps to plot a drawing:
1. Click the Plot button on the Standard toolbar.
AutoCAD opens the Plot dialog box.
2. Click the More Options button (at the bottom-right corner of the
dialog box, next to the Help button).
The Plot dialog box reveals additional settings, as shown in Figure 3-13.
3. In the Printer/Plotter area, select a printer from the Name list.
4. In the Paper Size area, select a paper size that’s loaded in your printer
or plotter.
Anything Letter size (81⁄2 x 11) or larger works for this example.
5. In the Plot Area, choose Limits.
This is the entire drawing area, which you specified when you set up the
drawing earlier in this chapter.
6. In the Plot Offset area, choose Center the Plot.
Alternatively, you can specify offsets of zero or other amounts in order
to position the plot at a specific location on the paper.
Figure 3-13:

area visible.
65
Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

7. In the Plot Scale area, deselect the Fit to Paper check box and choose
1:10 from the Scale drop-down list.
1:10 is the scale used to set up the drawing (in the earlier section, 
“A Simple Setup”).
8. In the Plot Style Table area, click the Name drop-down list and choose
monochrome.ctb.
The monochrome.ctb plot style table ensures that all your lines appear
solid black, rather than as weird shades of gray. See Chapter 12 for infor-
mation about plot style tables and monochrome and color plotting.
9. Click Yes when a Question dialog box appears, asking, “Assign this
plotstyle table to all layouts?” 
You can leave the remaining settings at their default values (refer to
Figure 3-13).
10. Point to the postage stamp–sized partial preview in the middle of the
Plot dialog box and pause the cursor.
A tooltip appears listing the Paper Size and Printable Area for the printer
and paper size that you selected.
11. Click the Preview button.
The Plot dialog box disappears temporarily and AutoCAD shows how
the plot will look on paper. In addition, AutoCAD prompts you on the
status bar:
Press pick button and drag vertically to zoom, ESC or
ENTER to exit, or right-click to display shortcut
menu.
12. Right-click in the preview area and choose Exit.
13. If the preview doesn’t look right, adjust the settings in the Plot dialog
box and look at the preview again until it looks right.
14. Click OK.
The Plot dialog box closes. AutoCAD generates the plot and sends it to
the printer. After generating the plot, AutoCAD displays a Plot and
Publish Job Complete balloon notification from the right end of the
status bar. (A Click to View Plot and Publish Details link displays more
information about the plot job.)
15. Click the X (close) button in the Plot and Publish Job Complete bal-
loon notification.
The balloon notification disappears.
66
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

If you’re not happy with the lineweights of the lines on your plot at this
point, fear not. You can use the lineweights feature (Chapter 5) or plot
styles (Chapter 12) to control plotted lineweights.
16. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
When you make changes to the plot settings, AutoCAD saves them with
the tab of the drawing that you plotted (the Model tab or one of the
paper space layout tabs). Save the drawing after you plot if you want the
modified plot settings to become the default plot settings the next time
you open the drawing.
Congratulations! You successfully executed your first plot in AutoCAD.
Chapter 12 tells you more — much more — about AutoCAD’s highly flexible
but occasionally perplexing plotting system.

 Creating and using drawing templates
S
urprisingly, drawing setup is one of the trickier aspects of using AutoCAD.
It’s an easy thing to do incompletely or wrong, and AutoCAD 2006 doesn’t
provide a dialog box or other simple, all-in-one-fell-swoop tool to help you do
all of it right. And yet, drawing setup is a crucial thing to get right. Setup steps
that you omit or don’t do right will come back to bite you — or at least gnaw
on your leg — later.
Sloppy setup really becomes apparent when you try to plot your drawing.
Things that seemed more or less okay as you zoomed around on the screen
suddenly are completely the wrong size or scale on paper. And nothing
brands someone as a naive AutoCAD wannabe as quickly as the inability to
plot a drawing at the right size and scale. Chapter 12 covers plotting proce-
dures, but the information in this chapter is a necessary prerequisite to suc-
cessful plotting. If you don’t get this stuff right, there’s a good chance you’ll
find that . . . the plot sickens.
This chapter describes the decisions you need to make before you set up a
new drawing, shows the steps for doing a complete and correct setup, and
demonstrates how to save setup settings for reuse.
Don’t assume that you can just create a new blank DWG file and start drawing
things. In other words, do read this chapter before you get too deep into the
later chapters in this book. Many AutoCAD drawing commands and concepts
depend on proper drawing setup, so you’ll have a much easier time of draw-
ing and editing things if you’ve done your setup homework. A few minutes
invested in setting up a drawing well can save hours of thrashing around
later on. 

After you’ve digested the detailed drawing setup procedures described in
this chapter, use the Drawing Setup Roadmap on the Cheat Sheet at the front
of this book to guide you through the process.
A Setup Roadmap
You need to set up AutoCAD correctly, partly because AutoCAD is so flexible
and partly because, well, you’re doing CAD — computer-aided drafting (or
design). The computer can’t aid your drafting (or design) if you don’t clue it
in on things like system of measure, drawing scale, paper size, and units. In
this context, the following reasons help explain why AutoCAD drawing setup
is important:
 Electronic paper: The most important thing you can do to make using
AutoCAD fun is to work on a correctly set up drawing so that your
screen acts like paper, only smarter. When drawing on real paper, you
constantly have to translate between units on the paper and the real-life
units of the object you’re drawing. But when drawing in AutoCAD, you
can draw directly in real-life units — feet and inches, millimeters, or
whatever you typically use on your projects. AutoCAD can then calcu-
late distances and dimensions for you and add them to the drawing.
You can make the mouse pointer jump directly to hot spots on-screen,
and a visible, resizable grid gives you a better sense of the scale of your
drawing. However, this smart paper function works well only if you tell
AutoCAD some crucial parameters for your specific drawing. AutoCAD
can’t really do its job until you tell it how to work.
 Dead-trees paper: Creating a great drawing on-screen that doesn’t fit
well on paper is all too easy. After you finish creating your drawing on
the smart paper AutoCAD provides on-screen, you usually must then
plot it on the good, old-fashioned paper that people have used for thou-
sands of years. At that point, you must deal with the fact that people like
to use certain standard paper sizes and drawing scales. (Most people
also like everything to fit neatly on one sheet of paper.) If you set up
AutoCAD correctly, good plotting results automatically; if not, plotting
time can become one colossal hassle.
 It ain’t easy: AutoCAD provides templates and Setup Wizards for you,
but the templates don’t work well unless you understand them, and
some of the wizards don’t work well even if you do understand them.
This deficiency is one of the major weaknesses in AutoCAD. You must
figure out on your own how to make the program work right. If you just
plunge in without carefully setting it up, your drawing and printing
efforts are likely to wind up a real mess.
70
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Fortunately, setting up AutoCAD correctly is a bit like following a roadmap to
a new destination. Although the directions for performing your setup are
complex, you can master them with attention and practice. Even more fortu-
nately, this chapter provides a detailed and field-tested route. And soon,
you’ll know the route like the back of your hand.
While you’re working in AutoCAD, always keep in mind what your final output
should look like on real paper. Even your first printed drawings should look
just like hand-drawn ones — only without all those eraser smudges.
Before you start the drawing setup process, you need to make decisions
about your new drawing. The following three questions are absolutely criti-
cal; if you don’t answer them, or you answer them wrong, you’ll probably
need to do lots of reworking of the drawing later:
 What drawing units will you use?
 At what scale — or scales — will you plot it?
 On what size paper does it need to fit?
In some cases, you can defer answering one additional question, but it’s usu-
ally better to deal with it up front: What kind of border or title block does
your drawing require?
71
Chapter 4: Setup for Success
AutoCAD and paper
In other Windows programs, you can use any
scaling factor you want to squeeze content onto
paper. You’ve probably printed an Excel spread-
sheet or Web page at some odd scaling factor,
such as 82.5 percent of full size, because that’s
what it took to squeeze the content onto a single
sheet of paper while keeping the text as large
as possible.
In drafting, your printout needs to use a specific,
widely accepted scaling factor, such as 1:50 or
1⁄4" = 1'–0", to be useful and understandable to
others. But the AutoCAD screen does not auto-
matically enforce any one scaling factor or
paper size. If you just start drawing stuff on the
AutoCAD screen to fit your immediate needs, it’s
unlikely that the final result will fit neatly on a
piece of paper at a desirable scale.
This chapter tells you how to start your draw-
ing in such a way that you’ll like how it ends 
up. With practice, this kind of approach will
become second nature.

If you’re in a hurry, it’s tempting to find an existing drawing that was set up
for the drawing scale and paper size that you want to use, make a copy of
that DWG file, erase the objects, and start drawing. Use this approach with
care, though. When you start from another drawing, you inherit any setup
mistakes in that drawing. Also, drawings that were created in much older ver-
sions of AutoCAD may not take advantage of current program features and
CAD practices. If you can find a suitable drawing that was set up in a recent
version of AutoCAD by an experienced person who is conscientious about
doing setup right, consider using it. Otherwise, you’re better off setting up a
new drawing from scratch.
Choosing your units
AutoCAD is extremely flexible about drawing units; it lets you have them your
way. Usually, you choose the type of units that you normally use to talk about
whatever you’re drawing: feet and inches for a building in the United States,
millimeters for a metric screw, and so on.
Speaking of millimeters, there’s another choice you have to make even before
you choose your units of measure, and that’s your system of measure.
Most of the world abandoned local systems of measure generations ago. Even
widely adopted ones like the imperial system have mostly fallen by the way-
side, just like their driving force, the British Empire. Except, of course, in the
United States, where feet, inches, pounds, gallons, and degrees Fahrenheit
still rule.
72
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Enter the metric system
. . . or, “Let’s forget everything we learned about
measuring stuff and start over again!” All (well,
nearly all) the world is metric. Instead of a
system of linear measure based on twelves, of
volume measure based on sixteens, and of tem-
perature measure based on who knows what,
metric bases all types of measure on tens. Of
course, For Dummies books are in the metric
vanguard because every single For Dummies
title includes a Part of Tens.
The metric system first gained a toe-hold (ten
toes, of course) in France during the Revolution.
Over time it became apparent that some 
standardization was called for, and a mere 
century-and-a-half later, SI Metric became that
standard. SI is short for Systeme International
d’Unites. (That’s International System of Units in
English. Isn’t it great to speak more than one
language?)
The U.S.A. may be late coming to the party, but
the Federal Government has made a commit-
ment to adopt SI Metric. For more information,
point your browser to the National Institute of
Standards and Technology’s Special Publication
814 (http://ts.nist.gov/ts/htdocs/
200/202/pub814.htm).

During drawing setup, you choose two units characteristics: a type of unit —
Scientific, Decimal, Engineering, Architectural, and Fractional — and a preci-
sion of measurement in the Drawing Units dialog box, shown in Figure 4-1.
(We show you how later in this chapter.) Engineering and Architectural units
are in feet and inches; Engineering units use decimals to represent partial
inches, and Architectural units use fractions to represent them. AutoCAD’s
other unit types — Decimal, Fractional, and Scientific — are unitless because
AutoCAD doesn’t know or care what the base unit is. If you configure a draw-
ing to use Decimal units, for example, each drawing unit could represent a
micron, millimeter, inch, foot, meter, kilometer, mile, parsec, the length of the
king’s forearm, or any other unit of measurement that you deem convenient.
It’s up to you to decide.
After you specify a type of unit, you draw things on-screen full size in those
units just as though you were laying them out on the construction site or in
the machine shop. You draw an 8-foot-high line, for example, to indicate the
height of a wall and an 8-inch-high line to indicate the cutout for a doggie
door (for a Dachshund, naturally). The on-screen line may actually be only 2
inches long at a particular zoom resolution, but AutoCAD stores the length as
8 feet. This way of working is easy and natural for most people for whom CAD
is their first drafting experience, but it seems weird to people who’ve done a
lot of manual drafting. If you’re in the latter category, don’t worry; you’ll soon
get the hang of it.
When you use dash-dot linetypes (Chapter 5) and hatching (Chapter 11) in
a drawing, it matters to AutoCAD whether the drawing uses an imperial
(inches, feet, miles, and so on) or metric (millimeters, meters, kilometers,
and so on) system of units. The MEASUREMENT system variable controls
whether the linetype and hatch patterns that AutoCAD lists for you to choose
from are scaled with inches or millimeters in mind as the plotting units. MEA-
SUREMENT=0 means inches (that is, an imperial units drawing), whereas
Figure 4-1:

Drawing
Units dialog
box.

Chapter 4: Setup for Success

MEASUREMENT=1 means millimeters (that is, a metric units drawing). If you
start from an appropriate template drawing, as described later in this chap-
ter, the MEASUREMENT system variable will be set correctly and you won’t
ever have to think about it. 
Weighing your scales
The next decision you should make before setting up a new drawing is choos-
ing the scale at which you’ll eventually plot the drawing. This decision gives
you the drawing scale and drawing scale factor — two ways of expressing the
same relationship between the objects in the real world and the objects plot-
ted on paper. 
You shouldn’t just invent some arbitrary scale based on your CD-ROM speed
or camera’s zoom lens resolution. Most industries work with a fairly small set
of approved drawing scales that are related to one another by factors of 2 or
10. If you use other scales, you’ll at best be branded a clueless newbie — and
at worst have to redo all your drawings at an accepted scale.
74
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Drawing scale versus the drawing scale factor
CAD users employ two different ways of talking
about a drawing’s intended plot scale: drawing
scale and drawing scale factor.
Drawing scale is the traditional way of describ-
ing a scale — traditional in that it existed long
before CAD came to be. Drawing scales are
expressed with an equal sign or colon; for
example 1⁄8" = 1'–0", 1:20, or 2:1. Translate the
equal sign or colon as “corresponds to.” In all
cases, the measurement to the left of the equal
sign or colon indicates a paper measurement,
and the number to the right indicates a CAD
drawing and real-world measurement. In other
words, the imperial drawing scale 1⁄8" = 1'–0"
means that 1⁄8" on the plotted drawing corre-
sponds to 1'–0" in the CAD drawing and in the
real world, assuming that the plot was made at
the proper scale. A metric drawing scale is usu-
ally expressed without units, as a simple ratio.
Thus, a scale of 1:20 means one unit on the plot-
ted drawing corresponds to twenty units in the
real world (or the CAD drawing, since you’re
drawing everything full size, right?). In architec-
tural and engineering drawings, the numbers
usually refer to millimeters. 
Drawing scale factor is a single number that
represents a multiplier, such as 96, 20, or 0.5.
The drawing scale factor for a drawing is the
conversion factor between a measurement on
the plot and a measurement in a CAD drawing
and the real world.
Those of you who did your math homework in
junior high will realize that drawing scale and
drawing scale factor are two interchangeable
ways of describing the same relationship. The
drawing scale factor is the multiplier that con-
verts the first number in the drawing scale into
the second number.

Table 4-1 lists some common architectural drawing scales, using both imper-
ial and metric units. The table also lists the drawing scale factor correspond-
ing to each drawing scale and the common uses for each scale. If you work in
other industries than those listed here, ask drafters or co-workers what the
common drawing scales are and for what kinds of drawings they’re used.

After you choose a drawing scale, engrave the corresponding drawing scale
factor on your desk, write it on your hand (don’t mix those two up, okay?),
and put it on a sticky note on your monitor. You need to know the drawing
scale factor for many drawing tasks, as well as for some plotting. You should
be able to recite the drawing scale factor of any drawing you’re working on in
AutoCAD without even thinking about it.
Even if you will use the Plot dialog box’s Fit to Paper option, rather than a
specific scale factor, to plot the drawing, you need to choose an artificial
scale to make text, dimensions, and other annotations appear at a useful size.
Choose a scale that’s in the neighborhood of the Fit to Paper plotting factor,
which AutoCAD displays in the Plot Scale area of the Plot dialog box. For
example, if you determine that you need to squeeze your drawing down
about 90 times to fit on the desired sheet size, choose a drawing scale of 1⁄8
inch = 1'–0" (drawing scale factor = 96) if you’re using architectural units or
1:100 (drawing scale factor = 100) for other kinds of units.
75
Chapter 4: Setup for Success

Most of the time, for most people, there are way too many scales in the lists
you see in the Viewports toolbar and the Plot dialog box. AutoCAD 2006 has a
handy dandy Edit Scales List dialog box that lets you remove those imperial
scales if you never work in feet and inches. And vice versa, for the metrically
challenged. To run through your scales, choose Format➪Scale List. If you
make a mistake, the Reset button will restore all the default scales.
Thinking about paper
With knowledge of your industry’s common drawing scales, you can choose a
provisional scale based on what you’re depicting. But you won’t know for
sure whether that scale works until you compare it with the size of the paper
that you want to use for plotting your drawing. Here again, most industries
use a small range of standard sheet sizes. Three common sets of sizes exist,
as shown in Figure 4-2 and Table 4-2:
 ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
 Architectural
 ISO (International Standard Organization).

You select a particular set of sheet sizes based on the common practices in
your industry. You then narrow down your choice based on the area required
by what you’re going to draw. For example, most imperial-units architectural
plans are plotted on Architectural D or E size sheets.
If you know the desired sheet size and drawing scale factor, you can calculate
the available drawing area easily. Simply multiply each of the sheet’s dimen-
sions (X and Y) by the drawing scale factor. For example, if you choose an 
11-x-17-inch sheet and a drawing scale factor of 96 (corresponding to a plot
scale of 1⁄8" = 1'–0"), you multiply 17 times 96 and 11 times 96 to get an avail-
able drawing area of 1,632 inches x 1,056 inches (or 136 feet x 88 feet). If your
sheet size is in inches but your drawing scale is in millimeters, you need to
multiply by an additional 25.4 to convert from inches to millimeters. For
example, with an 11-x-17-inch sheet and a scale of 1:200 (drawing scale factor
= 200), you multiply 17 times 200 times 25.4 and 11 times 200 times 25.4 to get
86,360 x 55,880 mm or 86.36 x 55.88 m — not quite big enough for a football
field (United States or European football).
Conversely, if you know the sheet size that you’re going to use and the real-
world size of what you’re going to draw, and you want to find out the largest
plot scale you can use, you have to divide, not multiply. Divide the needed
real-world drawing area dimensions (X and Y) by the sheet’s dimensions (X
and Y). Take the larger number — either X or Y — and round up to the nearest
real drawing scale factor (that is, one that’s commonly used in your industry).
For example, suppose you want to draw a 60-x-40-foot (or 720-x-480-inch) floor
plan and print it on 11-x-17-inch paper. You divide 720 by 17 and 480 by 11 to
get 42.35 and 43.64, respectively. The larger number, 43.64, corresponds in this
example to the short dimension of the house and the paper. The nearest larger
common architectural drawing scale factor is 48 (corresponding to 1⁄4" = 1'–0"),
which leaves a little room for the plotting margin and title block.
77
Chapter 4: Setup for Success

The Cheat Sheet at the front of this book includes two tables that list the
available drawing areas for a range of sheet sizes and drawing scales. Use
those tables to help you decide on an appropriate paper size and drawing
scale, and revert to the calculation method for situations that the tables
don’t cover. If you don’t keep a favorite old calculator on your physical desk-
top, don’t despair — AutoCAD 2006 has one lurking on the Tools menu.
(Choose Tools➪QuickCalc or press Ctrl+8 to access it.)
When you select a sheet size and drawing scale, always leave some extra
room for the following two reasons:
 Most plotters and printers can’t print all the way to the edge of the
sheet — they require a small margin. For example, Mark’s trusty old
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III has a printable area of about 7.9 x 10.5
inches on an 8.5-x-11-inch ANSI A size (letter size) sheet. (You’ll find this
information in the Plot dialog box, as described in Chapter 12.) If you’re
a stickler for precision, you can use the printable area instead of the
physical sheet area in the calculations described earlier in this section.
 Most drawings require some annotations — text, grid bubbles, and so
on — outside the objects you’re drawing, plus a title block surrounding
the objects and annotations. If you don’t leave some room for the anno-
tations and title block, you’ll end up having to cram things together too
much or change to a different sheet size. Either way, you’ll be slowed
down later in the project when you can least afford it. Figure 4-3 shows
an extreme example of selecting a sheet size that’s too small or, con-
versely, a drawing scale that’s too large. In this example, the building is
too long for the sheet, and it overlaps the title block on both the right
and left sides.
Some industries deal with the “sheet-is-too-small/drawing-scale-is-too-large”
problem by breaking drawings up onto multiple plotted sheets.
Don’t be afraid to start with paper. Experienced drafters often make a quick,
throwaway pencil and paper sketch called a cartoon. A drawing cartoon usu-
ally includes a rectangle indicating the sheet of paper you intend to plot on,
a sketch of the title block, and a very rough, schematic sketch of the thing
you’re going to draw. It helps to scribble down the dimensions of the sheet,
the main title block areas, and the major objects to be drawn. By sketching
out a cartoon, you’ll often catch scale or paper size problems before you set
up a drawing, when repairs only take a few minutes, not after you’ve created
the drawing, when fixing the problem can take hours.
78
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Defending your border
The next decision to make is what kind of border your drawing deserves. The
options include a full-blown title block, a simple rectangle, or nothing at all
around your drawing. If you need a title block, do you have one, can you
borrow an existing one, or will you need to draw one from scratch? Although
you can draw title block geometry in an individual drawing, you’ll save time
by reusing the same title block for multiple drawings. Your company may
already have a standard title block drawing ready to use, or someone else
who’s working on your project may have created one for the project.
The right way to draw a title block is in a separate DWG file at its normal plot-
ted size (for example, 36 inches long by 24 inches high for an architectural D
size title block, or 841 mm long by 594 mm high for an ISO A1 size version).
You then insert or xref the title block drawing into each sheet drawing.
Chapter 13 describes how to insert and xref separate DWG files.

Chapter 4: Setup for Success

All system variables go
As Chapter 2 describes, AutoCAD includes a slew of system variables that con-
trol the way your drawing and the AutoCAD program work. Much of the draw-
ing setup process involves setting system variables based on the drawing
scale, sheet size, and other desired properties of the drawing. You can set
some system variables in AutoCAD dialog boxes, but a few must be entered
at the keyboard. Table 4-3 shows the settings that you most commonly need
to change — or at least check — during drawing setup, along with the names
of the corresponding system variables. Later in the chapter, in the “Making
the Most of Model Space” section, we show you the procedure for changing
these settings.

A Template for Success
When you start AutoCAD 2006 with its desktop shortcut or from the Windows
Start menu, AutoCAD creates a new, blank drawing. Depending on where you
live (your country, not your street address!) and the dominant system of mea-
sure used there, AutoCAD will base this new drawing on one of two default
template drawings: acad.dwt (imperial system of measure as used in the
United States) or acadiso.dwt (metric system, used throughout the rest of
the galaxy). When you explicitly create a new drawing from within AutoCAD,
the Select Template dialog box, shown in Figure 4-4, appears by default so
that you can choose a template on which to base your new drawing.
80
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

A template is simply a drawing whose name ends in the letters DWT, which
you use as the starting point for another drawing. When you create a new
drawing from a template, AutoCAD makes a copy of the template file and
opens the copy in a new drawing editor window. The first time you save the
file, you’re prompted for a new filename to save to; the original template file
stays unchanged.
You may be familiar with the Microsoft Word or Excel template documents,
and AutoCAD template drawings work pretty much the same way — because
Autodesk stole the idea from them! (Encouraged, of course, by Microsoft.)
Using a suitable template can save you time and worry because many of the
setup options are already set correctly for you. You know the drawing will
print correctly; you just have to worry about getting the geometry and text
right. Of course, all this optimism assumes that the person who set up the
template knew what he or she was doing. 
The stock templates that come with AutoCAD are okay as a starting point,
but you’ll need to modify them to suit your purposes, or create your own
from scratch. In particular, the stock AutoCAD templates aren’t set up for the
scales that you’ll want to use. The instructions in the rest of this chapter tell
you how to specify scale-dependent setup information.
So the only problems with templates are creating good ones and then later
finding the right one to use when you need it. Later in this chapter, in the
“Making Templates Your Own” section, we show you how to create templates
from your own setup drawings. Here we show you how to use an already cre-
ated template, such as one of the templates that comes with AutoCAD 2006
or from one of your CAD-savvy colleagues. If you’re lucky, someone in your
office will have created suitable templates that you can use to get going
quickly.

Chapter 4: Setup for Success

Follow these steps to create a new drawing from a template drawing:
1. Run the NEW command by pressing Ctrl+N or choosing File➪New.
The Select Template dialog box appears.
The first button on the Standard toolbar runs the QNEW (Quick NEW)
command instead of the ordinary NEW command. Unless you or some-
one else has changed the Drawing Template Settings in the Options
dialog box, QNEW does the same thing as NEW. See the “Making
Templates Your Own” section, later in this chapter, for information
about how to take advantage of QNEW.
2. Click the name of the template that you want to use as the starting
point for your new drawing and then click the Open button.
A new drawing window with a temporary name, such as Drawing2.dwg,
appears. (The template you opened remains unchanged on your hard
disk.)
Depending on which template you choose, your new drawing may open
with a paper space layout tab, not the Model tab, selected. If that’s the
case, click the Model tab before changing the settings described in the
“Making the Most of Model Space” section. The “Plotting a Layout in
Paper Space” section, later in this chapter, describes how to set up and
take advantage of paper space layouts.
3. Press Ctrl+S and save the file under a new name.
Take the time to save the drawing to the appropriate name and
location now.
4. Make needed changes.
For most of the templates that come with AutoCAD, you need to con-
sider changing the units, limits, grid and snap settings, linetype scale,
and dimension scale. See the “Making the Most of Model Space” section
for instructions.
5. Consider saving the file as a template.
If you’ll need other drawings in the future similar to the current one,
consider saving your modified template as a template in its own right.
See the “Making Templates Your Own” section, later in this chapter.
The simplest, no-frills templates are acad.dwt (for people who custom-
arily work in imperial units) and acadiso.dwt (for people who custom-
arily work in metric). Most of the remaining templates that come with
AutoCAD include title blocks for various sizes of sheets. In addition,
most templates come in two versions — one for people who use color-
dependent plot styles and one for people who use named plot styles.
You probably want the color-dependent versions. (Chapter 12 describes
the two kinds of plot styles and why you probably want the color-
dependent variety.) We warned you that this drawing setup stuff would
be complicated!
82
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

If you dig around in the Options dialog box, you may discover a setting that
turns on the old Startup dialog box, which offers several options other than
starting with a template. Among these options are the enticingly named Setup
Wizards. These so-called wizards were lame when they first appeared; they’re
no better now. Autodesk acknowledges as much by making them almost
impossible to find in AutoCAD 2006.
Making the Most of Model Space
Most drawings require a two-part setup:
1. Set up the model space tab, where you’ll create most of your drawing.
2. Create one or more paper space layout tabs for plotting.
After you’ve decided on drawing scale and sheet size, you can perform model
space setup as described in this section.
Setting your units
First, you should set the linear and angular units that you want to use in your
new drawing. The following procedure describes how:
1. Choose Format➪Units from the menu bar.
The Drawing Units dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-5.
Figure 4-5:
The default
unitless
units.
83
Chapter 4: Setup for Success

2. Choose a linear unit type from the Length Type drop-down list.
Choose the type of unit representation that’s appropriate for your work.
Engineering and Architectural units are displayed in feet and inches; the
other types of units aren’t tied to any particular unit of measurement.
You decide whether each unit represents a millimeter, centimeter, meter,
inch, foot, or something else. Your choice is much simpler if you’re
working in metric: Choose Decimal units.
AutoCAD can think in inches! If you’re using Engineering or Architectural
units (feet and inches), AutoCAD understands any coordinate you enter
as a number of inches. You use the ’ (apostrophe) character on your key-
board to indicate a number in feet instead of inches.
3. From the Length Precision drop-down list, choose the degree of 
precision you want when AutoCAD displays coordinates and linear
measurements.
The precision setting controls how precisely AutoCAD displays coordi-
nates, distances, and prompts in some dialog boxes. In particular, the
Coordinates box on the status bar displays the current cursor coordi-
nates using the current precision. A grosser — that is, less precise — 
precision setting makes the numbers displayed in the status bar more
readable and less jumpy. So be gross for now; you can always act a little
less gross later.
The linear and angular precision settings only affect AutoCAD’s display
of coordinates, distances, and angles on the status bar, in dialog boxes,
and in the command line and dynamic cursor areas. For drawings stored
as DWG files, AutoCAD always uses maximum precision to store the
locations and sizes of all objects that you draw. In addition, AutoCAD
provides separate settings for controlling the precision of dimension
text — see Chapter 10 for details.
4. Choose an angular unit type from the Angle Type drop-down list.
Decimal Degrees and Deg/Min/Sec are the most common choices.
The Clockwise check box and the Direction button provide additional
angle measurement options, but you’ll rarely need to change the default
settings: Measure angles counterclockwise and use east as the 0 degree
direction.
5. From the Angle Precision drop-down list, choose the degree of preci-
sion you want when AutoCAD displays angular measurements.
6. In the Drag-and-Drop Scale area, choose the units of measurement for
this drawing.
Choose your base unit for this drawing — that is, the real-world distance
represented by one AutoCAD unit.
7. Click OK to exit the dialog box and save your settings.
84
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Telling your drawing its limits
The next model space setup task is to set your drawing’s limits. You wouldn’t
want it staying out all night and hanging out with just anybody, would you?
The limits represent the rectangular working area that you’ll draw on, which
usually corresponds to the paper size. Setting limits correctly gives you the
following advantages:
 When you turn on the grid (described in the following section), the grid
displays in the rectangular limits area. With the grid on and the limits set
correctly, you always see the working area that corresponds to what you’ll
eventually be plotting, so you won’t accidentally color outside the lines.
 The ZOOM command’s All option zooms to the greater of the limits or
the drawing extents. (The extents of a drawing consist of a rectangular
area just large enough to include all the objects in the drawing.) When
you set limits properly and color within the lines, ZOOM All gives you a
quick way to zoom to your working area.
 If you plot from model space, you can choose to plot the limits area.
This option gives you a quick, reliable way to plot your drawing, but
only if you’ve set limits correctly!
Many CAD drafters don’t set limits properly in their drawings. After you read
this section, you can smugly tell them why they should and how.
You can start the LIMITS command from a menu choice, but all subsequent
action takes place on the command line or the dynamic cursor; despite the
importance of the topic, AutoCAD has no dialog box for setting limits. 
The following procedure shows you how to set your drawing limits:
1. Choose Format➪Drawing Limits from the menu bar to start the LIMITS
command.
AutoCAD prompts you, both with a dynamic cursor tooltip and at the
command line at the bottom of the screen, to reset the model space
limits.
Command: limits
Reset Model space limits:
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.000,0.0000>:
The value at the end of the last line of the command line prompt is the
default value for the lower-left corner of the drawing limits. It appears
according to the units and precision that you selected in the Drawing
Units dialog box — for example, 0'–0" if you selected Architectural units
with precision to the nearest inch.
85
Chapter 4: Setup for Success

2. Type the lower-left corner of the limits you want to use and press
Enter.
The usual value to enter at this point is 0,0. (Type a zero, a comma, and
then another zero, with no spaces.) You can just press Enter to accept the
default value.
Regardless of what you see in the dynamic cursor, when you press Enter
to accept a default value, the value that will be accepted is the one that
shows in the command line, not what you see at the tooltip.
AutoCAD now prompts you for the upper-right corner of the limits:
Specify upper right corner <12.0000,9.0000>:
The initial units offered by AutoCAD correspond to an Architectural A
size sheet of paper in landscape orientation. (Almost no one uses
Architectural A size paper; here’s a classic example of a programmer
choosing a silly default that no one has bothered to change in 22 years!)
If you live in a metric-dominant location, the second prompt will read:
Specify upper right corner <420.0000,297.0000>:
These numbers correspond to an ISO A3 size sheet (much more up-to-
date than those silly, old-fashioned imperial settings!).
3. Type the upper-right corner of the limits you want to use and press
Enter.
You calculate the usual setting for the limits’ upper-right corner by mul-
tiplying the paper dimensions by the drawing scale factor. For example,
if you’re setting up a 1⁄8" = 1'–0" drawing (drawing scale factor = 96) to be
plotted on a 24-x-36-inch sheet in landscape orientation, the upper-right
corner of the limits should be 36 inches times 96, 24 inches times 96.
Okay, pencils down. The correct answer is 3456,2304 (or 288 feet, 192
feet).
Alternatively, you can cheat when specifying limits and read the limits
from the tables on the Cheat Sheet.
If you have the grid turned on, AutoCAD redisplays it in the new limits
area after you press Enter.
If you’re using Architectural or Engineering units and you want to enter
measurements in feet and not inches, you must add the foot designator
after the number, such as 6'; otherwise, AutoCAD assumes that you
mean inches.
4. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
AutoCAD zooms to the new limits.
86
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Making the drawing area 
snap-py (and grid-dy)
AutoCAD’s grid is a set of evenly spaced, visible dots that serve as a visual
distance reference. (As we describe in the preceding section, “Telling your
87
Chapter 4: Setup for Success
Making snap (and grid) decisions
You can set your grid spacing to work in one of
two ways: to help with your drawing or to help
you remain aware of how objects will relate to
your plot. For a grid that helps with your draw-
ing, set the grid points a logical number of mea-
surement units apart. For example, you might
set the grid to 30 feet (10 yards) on a drawing of
a (U.S.) football field. This kind of setting makes
your work easier as you draw.
Another approach is to choose a grid spacing
that represents a specific distance, such as 1
inch or 25 millimeters, on your final plot. If you
want the grid to represent 1 inch on the plot and
your drawing units are inches, enter the draw-
ing scale factor. For example, in a 1⁄4" = 1'–0"
drawing, you’d enter the drawing scale factor
of 48. A 48-inch grid interval in your drawing
corresponds to a 1-inch interval on the plot
when you plot to scale. If your drawing units are
millimeters and you want the grid to represent
25 millimeters on the plot, enter the drawing
scale factor times 25. For example, in a 1:50
drawing, you’d enter 25 x 50, or 1250.
In most cases, you’ll want to set the snap inter-
val considerably smaller than the grid spacing.
A good rule is to start with a snap spacing in the
range of the size of the smallest objects that
you’ll be drawing — 6 inches or 100 millimeters
for a building plan, 0.5 inches or 5 millimeters for
an architectural detail, 1⁄16 inch or 1 millimeter for
a small mechanical component, and so on.
Leaving the grid on in your drawing all the time
is worthwhile because it provides a visual
reminder of how far apart things are. This visual
reference is especially useful as you zoom in
and out.
You don’t always want to leave snap turned on,
however. Some drawings, such as contour
maps, are made up mostly of objects with weird,
uneven measurements. Even drawings with
many objects that fall on convenient spacings
will have some unruly objects that don’t. In 
addition, you sometimes need to turn off snap
temporarily to select objects. Despite these
caveats, snap is a useful tool in most drawings. 
Setting the snap spacing to a reasonable value
when you set up a new drawing is a good idea.
Toggle snap off (by clicking the SNAP button on
the status bar or pressing the F9 key) when you
don’t need it or find that it’s getting in the way.
Toggle snap on before drawing objects that
align with specific spacings, including text and
dimension strings that you want to align neatly.
To use snap effectively, you need to make the
snap setting smaller as you zoom in and work
on more detailed areas, and larger as you zoom
back out. You are likely to find yourself chang-
ing the snap setting fairly frequently. The grid
setting, on the other hand, can usually remain
constant even as you work at different zoom
settings; that keeps you oriented as to how far
zoomed in you are in the drawing.

drawing its limits,” the grid also indicates how far the drawing limits extend.)
AutoCAD’s snap feature creates a set of evenly spaced, invisible hot spots,
which make the cursor move in nice, even increments. Both grid and snap
are like the intersection points of the lines on a piece of grid paper, but grid is
simply a visual reference, whereas snap constrains the points that you can
pick with the mouse. You can — and usually will — set the grid and snap
spacing to different distances.
Set the grid and the snap intervals in the Drafting Settings dialog box with
these steps:
1. Right-click the Snap or Grid button in the status bar and choose
Settings.
The Drafting Settings dialog box appears with the Snap and Grid tab
selected, as shown in Figure 4-6.
The Snap and Grid tab has four parts, but the Snap and Grid sections are
all you need to worry about for most drafting work. 
2. Select the Snap On check box to turn on snap.
This action creates default snaps half a unit apart.
3. Enter the Snap X Spacing for the snap interval in the accompanying
text box.
Use the information in the sections preceding this procedure to decide
on a reasonable snap spacing.
The Y spacing automatically changes to equal the X spacing, which is
almost always what you want.

4. Select the Grid On check box to turn on the grid.
5. Enter the Grid X Spacing for the grid in the accompanying text box.
Use the information in the sections preceding this procedure to decide
on a reasonable grid spacing.
The Y spacing automatically changes to equal the X spacing. As with the
snap spacing, you usually want to leave it that way.
X measures horizontal distance; Y measures vertical distance. The
AutoCAD drawing area normally shows an X and Y icon in case you
forget.
6. Click OK to close the Drafting Settings dialog box.
You can also click the SNAP button on the status bar to toggle snap on and
off; the same goes for the GRID button and the grid setting.
Setting linetype and dimension scales
Even though you’ve engraved the drawing scale factor on your desk and writ-
ten it on your hand — not vice versa — AutoCAD doesn’t know the drawing
scale until you enter it. Keeping AutoCAD in the dark is fine as long as you’re
just drawing continuous lines and curves representing real-world geometry,
because you draw these objects at their real-world size, without worrying
about plot scale.
As soon as you start adding dimensions (measurements that show the size of
the things you’re drawing) and using dash-dot linetypes (line patterns that
contain gaps in them), you need to tell AutoCAD how to scale the parts of the
dimensions and the gaps in the linetypes based on the plot scale. If you
forget this, the dimension text and arrowheads can come out very tiny or
very large when you plot the drawing, and dash-dot linetype patterns can
look waaaay too big or too small. Figure 4-7 shows what we mean.
Figure 4-7:
The
dimension
and linetype
scales need

right.
89
Chapter 4: Setup for Success

The scale factor that controls dash-dot linetypes is found in a system variable
called LTSCALE (as in LineType SCALE). The scaling factor that controls
dimensions is found in a system variable called DIMSCALE. You can change
either of these settings at any time, but it’s best to set them correctly when
you’re setting up the drawing.
The following sequence includes directions for typing system variable and
command names. When the names are mixed case (for example, LTScale),
you can type the full name (LTSCALE) or just the letters shown in uppercase
(LTS) before pressing Enter.
To set the linetype scale at the keyboard, follow these steps:
1. Type LTScale and press Enter.
AutoCAD responds with a prompt, asking you for the scale factor. The
value at the end of the prompt is the current linetype scale setting, as
shown in the following command line example:
Enter new linetype scale factor <1.0000>:
2. Type the value you want for the linetype scale and press Enter.
The easiest choice is to set the linetype scale to the drawing scale factor.
Some people, however, find that the dashes and gaps in dash-dot line-
types get a bit too long when they use the drawing scale factor. If you’re
one of those people, set LTSCALE to one-half of the drawing scale factor.
(Feel free to experiment with this value; some people prefer a linetype
scale of three-quarters the scale factor. If you’re working in metric, try
0.75 times the scale factor instead.)
Alternatively, you can set LTSCALE in the Linetype Manager dialog box: Choose
Format➪Linetype, click the Show Details button, and type your desired line-
type scale in the Global Scale Factor text box.
To change the dimension scale, use the Dimension Style Manager dialog box. We
describe dimensions in detail in Chapter 10, but you should get in the habit of
setting the dimension scale during drawing setup. To do so, follow these steps: 
1. Choose Format➪Dimension Style from the menu bar, or enter
Dimstyle at the command line.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box appears. New drawings contain
the default dimension style named Standard (for English-unit drawings)
or ISO-25 (for metric drawings).
2. Click the Modify button.
The Modify Dimension Style dialog box appears.
3. Click the Fit tab.
The Fit tab options appear, including an area called Scale for Dimension
Features.
90
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

4. In the Scale for Dimension Features area, make sure that the radio
button next to the Use Overall Scale Of setting is selected.
5. In the text box next to Use Overall Scale Of, type the drawing scale
factor for the current drawing.
We told you that you’d be using that drawing scale factor a lot!
6. Click OK to close the Modify Dimension Style dialog box.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box reappears.
7. Click Close.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box closes. Now when you draw
dimensions, AutoCAD will scale the dimension text and arrowheads 
correctly.
Before you start creating dimensions, create your own dimension style(s) for
the settings that you want to use. Chapter 10 explains why and how.
Entering drawing properties
You need to do one last bit of bookkeeping before you’re finished with model
space drawing setup: Enter summary information in the Drawing Properties
dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-8. Choose File➪Drawing Properties to open
the Drawing Properties dialog box and then click the Summary tab. Enter the
drawing scale you’re using and the drawing scale factor, plus any other infor-
mation you think useful.

Plotting a Layout in Paper Space
As we describe in Chapter 2, paper space is a separate space in each drawing
for composing a printed version of that drawing. You create the drawing
itself, called the model, in model space. You then can create one or more plot-
table views, complete with title block. Each of these plottable views is called
a layout. AutoCAD saves separate plot settings with each layout — and with
the Model tab — so that you can plot each tab differently. In practice, you’ll
need to use only one of the paper space layout tabs, especially when you’re
getting started with AutoCAD.
A screen image is worth a thousand paper space explanations. If you haven’t
yet seen an example out in the wild, refer to Figures 2-7 and 2-8 in Chapter 2.
You also may want to open a few of the AutoCAD 2006 sample drawings and
click the Model and Layout tabs to witness the variety of ways in which
paper space is used. A good place to start is Program Files\AutoCAD
2006\Sample\Welding Fixture-1.dwg.
After you complete model space setup, you should create a layout for plot-
ting. You don’t need to create the plotting layout right after you create the
drawing and do model space setup; you can wait until after you’ve drawn
some geometry. You should set up a layout sooner, not later, however. If any
scale or sheet size problems exist, it’s better to discover them early.
In AutoCAD 2006, it’s still possible to ignore paper space layouts entirely and
do all your drawing and plotting in model space. But you owe it to yourself to
give layouts a try. You’ll probably find that they make plotting more consis-
tent and predictable. They’ll certainly give you more plotting flexibility when
you need it. And you’ll certainly encounter drawings from other people that
make extensive use of paper space, so you need to understand it if you plan
to exchange drawings with anyone else.
Creating a layout
Creating a simple paper space layout is straightforward, thanks to the
AutoCAD 2006 Create Layout Wizard, shown in Figure 4-9. (Yes! Finally, a
useful AutoCAD wizard.) The command name is LAYOUTWIZARD, which is
not to be confused with the WAYOUTLIZARD command for drawing geckos
and iguanas! In any event, you can avoid a lot of typing by choosing
Tools➪Wizards➪Create Layout.
92
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Although the Create Layout Wizard guides you step by step through the
process of creating a paper space layout from scratch, it doesn’t eliminate
the necessity of coming up with a sensible set of layout parameters. The
sheet size and plot scale that you choose provide a certain amount of space
for showing your model (see the information earlier in this chapter), and wiz-
ards aren’t allowed to bend the laws of arithmetic to escape that fact. For
example, a map of Texas at a scale of 1 inch = 1 foot won’t fit on an 81⁄2-x-11-
inch sheet, no way, no how. In other words, garbage in, garbage (lay)out.
Fortunately, the Create Layout Wizard lends itself to experimentation, and
you can easily delete layouts that don’t work.
Follow these steps to create a layout:
1. Choose Tools➪Wizards➪Create Layout, or type LAYOUTWIZARD and
press Enter.
2. Give the new layout a name, and then click Next.
In place of the default name, Layout3, we recommend something more
descriptive — for example, D Size Sheet.
3. Choose a printer or plotter to use when plotting this layout, and then
click Next.
Think of your choice as the default plotter for this layout. You can
change to a different plotter later, or create page setups that plot the
same layout on different plotters.
Many of the names in the configured plotter list should look familiar
because they’re your Windows printers (system printers in AutoCAD
lingo). Names with a .pc3 extension represent nonsystem printer dri-
vers. See Chapter 12 for details.
Figure 4-9:
The Create
Layout
Wizard. 
93
Chapter 4: Setup for Success

4. Choose a paper size and specify whether to use inches or millimeters
to represent paper units, and then click Next.
The available paper sizes depend on the printer or plotter that you
selected in Step 3.
5. Specify the orientation of the drawing on the paper, and then click
Next.
The icon showing the letter A on the piece of paper shows you which
orientation is which.
6. Select a title block or None (see Figure 4-10), and then click Next. 
If you choose a title block, specify whether AutoCAD should insert it as a
Block — which is preferable in this case — or attach it as an xref. 
Attaching a title block as an xref is a good practice if your title block
DWG file is in the same folder as the drawing that you’re working on.
The Create Layout Wizard’s title blocks live in the Template folder that’s
stored with the AutoCAD Application Data files under your Windows
user profile, which isn’t — or shouldn’t be — where you keep your pro-
ject files. Thus, in this case Block is a safer choice.
Choose a title block that fits your paper size. If the title block is larger
than the paper, the Create Layout Wizard simply lets it run off the paper.
If you don’t like any of the supplied title blocks, choose None. You can
always draw, insert, or xref a title block later. See Chapter 13 for informa-
tion about inserting or xrefing a title block.
Figure 4-10:
Title block
options in
the Create
Layout
Wizard.
94
Part I: AutoCAD 101 

The list of available title blocks comes from all the DWG files in your
AutoCAD Template folder. You can add custom title block drawings to
this directory (and delete ones that you never use). If you want to know
where to put them, see the “Making Templates Your Own” section, later
in this chapter.
7. Define the arrangement of viewports that AutoCAD should create, and
the paper space to model space scale for all viewports. Then click Next.
A paper space layout viewport is a window into model space. You must
create at least one viewport to display the model in your new layout. For
most 2D drawings, a single viewport is all you need. 3D models often
benefit from multiple viewports, each showing the 3D model from a dif-
ferent perspective.
The default Viewport scale, Scaled to Fit, ensures that all of your model
drawing displays in the viewport but results in an arbitrary scale factor.
Most technical drawings require a specific scale, such as 1:100 or 1⁄8" =
1'–0".
8. Specify the location of the viewport(s) on the paper by picking its cor-
ners. Then click Next.
After you click the Select Location button, the Create Layout Wizard dis-
plays the preliminary layout with any title block that you’ve chosen.
Pick two points to define a rectangle that falls within the drawing area of
your title block (or within the plottable area of the sheet, if you chose no
title block in Step 6).
AutoCAD represents the plottable area of the sheet with a dashed rec-
tangle near the edge of the sheet. If you don’t select a location for the
viewport(s), the Create Layout Wizard creates a viewport that fills the
plottable area of the sheet.
9. Click Finish.
AutoCAD creates the new layout.
Copying and changing layouts
After you create a layout, you can delete, copy, rename, and otherwise manip-
ulate it by right-clicking its tab. Figure 4-11 shows the right-click menu options.
The From Template option refers to layout templates. After you create lay-
outs in a template (DWT) or drawing (DWG) file, you use the From Template
option to import these layouts into the current drawing. For details, see the
LAYOUT command’s Template option in the Command Reference section of
online help.
95
Chapter 4: Setup for Success

Many drawings require only one paper space layout. If you always plot the
same view of the model and always plot to the same device and on the same
size paper, a single paper space layout should suffice. If you want to plot your
model in different ways (for example, at different scales, with different layers
visible, with different areas visible, or with different plotted line characteris-
tics), you may want to create additional paper space layouts.
Some different ways of plotting the same model can be handled in a single
paper space layout with different page setups. See Chapter 12 for more
details. 
If your projects require lots of drawings, you can parlay layouts into sheet
sets — a feature that makes for more sophisticated creation, management,
plotting, and electronic transfer of multi-sheet drawing sets. See Chapter 14
for details.
If you want to add another viewport to an existing layout, you need to
become familiar with the MVIEW command. (See the MVIEW command in
the Command Reference section of AutoCAD online help.) After you have the
concepts down, using the Viewports dialog box (choose View➪Viewports➪
New Viewports) and Viewports toolbar can help you create, scale, and
manage viewports more efficiently.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 

Lost in paper space
After you create a paper space layout, you suddenly have two views of the
same drawing geometry: the view on your original Model tab and the new
layout tab view (perhaps decorated with a handsome title block and other
accoutrements of plotting nobility). It’s important to realize that both views
are of the same geometry. If you change the model geometry on one tab,
you’re changing it on all tabs, because all tabs display the same model space
objects. It’s like seeing double after downing a few too many drinks — the
duplication is in your head, not in the real world (or in this case, in the CAD
world).
When you make a paper space layout current by clicking its tab, you can
move the cursor between paper space (that is, drawing and zooming on the
sheet of paper) and model space (drawing and zooming on the model, inside
the viewport) in several ways, including:
 Clicking the PAPER/MODEL button on the status bar
 In the drawing area, double-clicking over a viewport to move the cursor
into model space in that viewport, or double-clicking outside all view-
ports (for example, in the gray area outside the sheet) to move the
cursor into paper space
 Clicking the Maximize/Minimize Viewport button on the status bar (for
more information, see Chapter 2)
 Entering MSpace or PSpace at the keyboard
When the cursor is in model space, anything you draw or edit changes the
model (and thus appears on the Model tab and on all paper space layout
tabs, assuming that the given paper space layout displays that part of the
underlying model). When the cursor is in paper space, anything you draw
appears only on that one paper space layout tab. It’s as though you were
drawing on an acetate sheet over the top of that sheet of plotter paper — the
model beneath remains unaffected.
This distinction can be disorienting at first — even if you haven’t had a few
too many drinks. To avoid confusion, stick with the following approach (at
least until you’re more familiar with paper space):
 If you want to edit the model, switch to the Model tab first. (Don’t try to
edit the model in a paper space viewport.)
 If you want to edit a particular plot layout without affecting the model,
switch to that layout’s tab and make sure that the cursor is in paper
space.

Making Templates Your Own
You can create a template from any DWG file by using the Save As dialog box.
Follow these steps to save your drawing as a template:
1. Choose File➪Save As from the menu bar.
The Save Drawing As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-12.
2. From the Files of Type drop-down list, choose AutoCAD Drawing
Template (*.dwt).
3. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the drawing.
AutoCAD 2006’s default folder for template drawings is called Template
and is buried deep in the bowels of your Windows user profile. Save
your templates there if you want them to appear in the AutoCAD’s Select
Template list. You can save your templates in another folder, but if you
want to use them later, you’ll have to navigate to that folder each time
to use them. See the Technical Stuff paragraph after this procedure for
additional suggestions.
4. Enter a name for the drawing template in the File Name text box.
5. Click the Save button to save your drawing template.
The drawing is saved as a template. A dialog box for the template
description and units appears.
Figure 4-12:

6. Enter the template’s measurement units (English or Metric).
Enter the key info now; you can’t do it later unless you save the template
to a different name. Don’t bother filling in the Description field. AutoCAD
doesn’t display it later in the Select Template dialog box.
7. Click OK to save the file.
8. To save your drawing as a regular drawing, choose File➪Save As from
the menu bar.
The Save Drawing As dialog box appears again.
9. From the Files of Type drop-down list, choose AutoCAD 2004 Drawing
(*.dwg).
AutoCAD 2006 uses the same DWG file format as AutoCAD 2004, so the
file type is listed that way.
10. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the drawing.
Use a different folder from the one with your template drawings.
11. Enter the name of the drawing in the File Name text box.
12. Click the Save button to save your drawing.
The file is saved. Now, when you save it in the future, the regular file, not
the template file, gets updated.
AutoCAD 2006 includes a command called QNEW (Quick NEW), which, when
properly configured, can bypass the Select Template dialog box and create a
new drawing from your favorite template. The first button on the Standard
toolbar — the one with the plain white sheet of paper — runs the newer
QNEW command instead of the older NEW command. 
To put the Quick into QNEW, though, you have to tell AutoCAD which default
template to use: Choose Tools➪Options➪Files➪Template Settings➪Default
Template File Name for QNEW. AutoCAD 2006’s default setting for Default Tem-
plate File Name for QNEW is None, which causes QNEW to act just like NEW
(that is, QNEW opens the Select Template dialog box). 
AutoCAD 2006 stores template drawings and many other support files under
your Windows user folder. If you want to discover where your Template folder
is, choose Tools➪Options➪Files➪Template Settings➪Drawing Template File
Location. In all likelihood, your Template folder lives under a hidden folder, so
you won’t at first be able to see it in Windows Explorer. If you want to find the
template folder, open Windows Explorer and choose Tools➪Folder Options➪
View. Set the Hidden Files and Folders setting to Show Hidden Files and
Folders, click the OK button, and then choose View➪Refresh. (After you
99
Chapter 4: Setup for Success

snoop around, you’ll probably want to switch back to Do Not Show Hidden
Files and Folders.)
If you want to avoid this nonsense, create a folder where you can find it easily
(for example, C:\Acad-templates or F:\Acad-custom\templates on a net-
work drive). Put the templates that you actually use there and change the
Drawing Template File Location so that it points to your new template folder.
As this chapter demonstrates, there’s quite a bit to drawing setup in AutoCAD.
As with any other initially forbidding task, take it step by step, and soon the
sequence will seem natural. The Drawing Setup Roadmap on the Cheat Sheet
will help you stay on the road and avoid taking the wrong turnoff.

ines, circles, and other elements of geometry make up
the heart of your drawing. AutoCAD offers many dif-
ferent drawing commands, many ways to use them to
draw objects precisely, and many properties for control-
ling the objects’ display and plot appearance. After you
draw your geometry, you’ll probably spend at least as
much time editing it as your design and drawings evolve.
And in the process, you need to zoom in and out and
pan all around to see how the entire drawing is coming
together. Drawing geometry, editing it, and changing the
displayed view are the foundation of the drawing process;
this part shows you how to make that foundation solid.

AD programs are different from other drawing programs. You need to
pay attention to little details like object properties and the precision of
the points that you specify when you draw and edit objects. If you just start
drawing objects without taking heed of these details, you’ll end up with an
unruly mess of imprecise geometry that’s hard to edit, view, and plot. 
This chapter introduces you to the AutoCAD tools and techniques that help
you prevent making CAD messes. This information is essential before you start
drawing objects and editing them, which we describe in Chapters 6 and 7.
Drawing and Editing with AutoCAD
When you first start using AutoCAD, its most daunting requirement is the
number of property settings and precision controls that you need to pay
attention to — even when you draw a simple line. Unlike in many other pro-
grams, it’s not enough to draw a line in a more-or-less adequate location and
then slap some color on it. All those settings and controls can inspire the
feeling that you have to find out how to drive a Formula 1 car to make a trip
down the street. (The advantage is that, after you are comfortable in the
driver’s seat, AutoCAD will take you on the long-haul trips and get you there
faster.) 

The following are the three keys to good CAD drawing practice:
 Pay attention to and manage the properties of every object that you
draw — especially the layer that each object is on.
 Pay attention to and manage the named objects in every drawing — the
layers, text styles, block definitions, and other nongraphical objects that
serve to define the look of all the graphical objects in the drawing.
 Pay attention to and control the precision of every point and distance
that you use to draw and edit each object.
These can seem like daunting tasks at first, but the following three sections
help you cut them down to size.
Managing Your Properties
All the objects that you draw in AutoCAD are like good Monopoly players:
They own properties. In AutoCAD, these properties aren’t physical things;
they’re an object’s characteristics such as layer, color, linetype, and
lineweight. You use properties to communicate information about the charac-
teristics of the objects you draw, such as the kinds of real-world objects they
represent, their materials, their relative location in space, or their relative
importance. In CAD, you also use the properties to organize objects for edit-
ing and plotting purposes.
You can view — and change — all of an object’s properties in the Properties
palette. In Figure 5-1, the Properties palette shows properties for a line object.
Figure 5-1:
A line rich in
properties.
104
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

To toggle the Properties palette on and off, click the Properties button on the
Standard toolbar. Before you select an object, the Properties palette displays
the current properties — properties that AutoCAD applies to new objects
when you draw them. After you select an object, AutoCAD displays the prop-
erties for that object. If you select more than one object, AutoCAD displays
the properties that they have in common.
Putting it on a layer
Every object has a layer as one of its properties. You may be familiar with
layers — independent drawing spaces that stack on top of each other to
create an overall image — from using drawing programs. AutoCAD, like most
CAD programs, uses layers as the primary organizing principle for all the
objects that you draw. Layers organize objects into logical groups of things
that belong together; for example, walls, furniture, and text notes usually
belong on three separate layers, for a couple of reasons: 
 They give you a way to turn groups of objects on and off — both on the
screen and on the plot. 
 They provide the best way of controlling object color, linetype, and
lineweight.
105
Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw
Looking at layers
If you spent any time “on the boards,” as griz-
zled old-timers like to call paper-and-pencil
drafting, you may be familiar with the manual
drafting equivalent of layers. In pin-bar drafting,
you stack a series of transparent sheets, each
of which contains part of the overall drawing —
walls on one sheet, the plumbing system on
another, the electrical system on another, and
so on. You can get different views of the draw-
ing by including or excluding various sheets. 
If you’re too young to remember pin-bar 
drafting — or old enough to prefer not to — you
may remember something similar from a text-
book about human anatomy. There’s the skele-
ton on one sheet, the muscles on the next sheet
that you laid over the skeleton, and so on until
you built up a complete picture of the human
body — that is, if your parents didn’t remove
some of the more grown-up sections.
CAD layers serve a similar purpose: They
enable you to turn on or off groups of related
objects. But layers do a lot more. You use them
in AutoCAD to control other object display and
plot properties, such as color, linetype, and
lineweight. You also can use them to make
some editing tasks more efficient and reduce
the time that it takes AutoCAD to load some
drawings. Take the time to give each of your
drawings a suitably layered look.

So, to work efficiently in AutoCAD, you first create layers, assigning them
names and properties such as color and linetype. Then you draw objects on
those layers. When you draw an object, AutoCAD automatically puts it on the
current layer — the layer that you see in the Layers toolbar drop-down list
when no objects are selected.
Before you draw any object in AutoCAD, you should set an appropriate layer
current — creating it first, if necessary, using the procedure described later
in this section. If the layer already exists in your drawing, you can make it the
current layer by choosing it in the Layers toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Make sure that no objects are selected before you use the Layer drop-down
list to change the current layer. (Press the Esc key twice to be sure.) If objects
are selected, the Layer drop-down list displays (and lets you change) those
objects’ layer. When no objects are selected, the Layer drop-down list dis-
plays (and lets you change) the current layer.
If you forget to set an appropriate layer before you draw an object, you can
select the object and then change its layer by using either the Properties
palette or the Layer drop-down list.

layer before
you draw.

Accumulating properties
Besides layers, the remaining object properties that you’re likely to want to
use often are color, linetype, lineweight, and possibly plot style. Table 5-1
summarizes these four properties.

Long before AutoCAD was able to display lineweights on the screen and
print those same lineweights on paper, object colors controlled the printed
lineweight of objects. AutoCAD 2000 introduced a more logical system, where
you could assign an actual plotted thickness to objects. As logical as that
method seems, the older method, where the color of objects determined
their plotted lineweight, continues to dominate. You may find yourself work-
ing this way even in AutoCAD 2006, for compatibility with drawings (and 
co-workers) that use the old way, as described in the “About colors and
lineweights” sidebar.

Stacking up your layers
How do you decide what to call your layers and
which objects to put on them? Some industries
have developed layer guidelines, and many
offices have created documented layer stan-
dards. Some projects even impose specific
layer requirements. (But be careful; if someone
says, “You need a brick layer for this project,”
that can mean a couple of different things.) Ask
experienced CAD drafters in your office or
industry how they use layers in AutoCAD. If you
can’t find any definitive answer, create a chart
of layers for yourself. Each row in the chart
should list the layer name, default color, default
linetype, default lineweight, and what kinds 
of objects belong on that layer. Chapter 15
includes an example.

AutoCAD gives you two different ways of controlling object properties:
 By layer: Each layer has a default color, linetype, lineweight, and plot
style property. Unless you tell AutoCAD otherwise, objects inherit the
properties of the layers on which they’re created. AutoCAD calls this
approach controlling properties by layer.
 By object: AutoCAD also enables you to override an object’s layer’s
property setting and give the object a specific color, linetype, lineweight,
or plot style that differs from the layer’s. AutoCAD calls this approach
controlling properties by object.
If you’ve worked with other graphics programs, you may be used to assigning
properties such as color to specific objects. If so, you’ll be tempted to use the
by object approach to assigning properties in AutoCAD. Resist the tempta-
tion. Did you catch that? One more time: Resist the temptation.

About colors and lineweights
AutoCAD drafters traditionally have achieved
different printed lineweights by mapping vari-
ous on-screen display colors of drawing objects
to different plotted lineweights. An AutoCAD-
using company may decide that red lines are to
be plotted thin, green lines are to be plotted
thicker, and so on. This indirect approach
sounds strange, but until AutoCAD 2000, it was
the only practical way to plot from AutoCAD
with a variety of lineweights. Also, not many
people plotted in color until recently, so few
folks minded the fact that color was used to
serve a different master.
AutoCAD 2000 added lineweight as an inherent
property of objects and the layers that they live
on. Thus, object display color can revert to
being used for — surprise! — color. You can
use display colors to control plot colors, of
course. But even if you make monochrome
plots, you can use color to help you distinguish
different kinds of objects when you view them
on-screen or to make jazzy on-screen presen-
tations of drawings for others.
Lineweights are handy, but they have quirks.
Watch for these problems as you work with
them:
 Although lineweights may have been
assigned to objects in a drawing that you
open, you won’t necessarily see them on
the screen. You must turn on the Show/Hide
Lineweight button on the AutoCAD status
bar (the button labeled LWT). 
 On a slow computer or with a complex
drawing, showing lineweights may cause
AutoCAD to redraw the screen more slowly
when you zoom and pan. 
 You may need to zoom in on a portion of the
drawing before the differing lineweights
become apparent.

In almost all cases, it’s better to create layers, assign properties to each layer,
and let the objects on each layer inherit that layer’s properties. Here are
some benefits of using the by layer approach:
 You can easily change the properties of a group of related objects that
you put on one layer. You simply change the property for the layer, not
for a bunch of separate objects.
 Experienced drafters use the by layer approach, so if you work with
drawings from other people, you’ll be much more compatible with them
if you do it the same way. You’ll also avoid getting yelled at by irate CAD
managers, whose job duties include haranguing any hapless newbie who
assigns properties by object.
If you take our advice and assign properties by layer, all you have to do is set
layer properties in the Layer Properties Manager dialog box, as shown in
Figure 5-3. Before you draw any objects, make sure the Color Control,
Linetype Control, Lineweight Control, and Plot Style Control drop-down lists
on the Properties toolbar are set to ByLayer, as shown in Figure 5-4.
If the drawing is set to use color-based plot styles instead of named plot styles
(see Chapter 12), the Plot Style Control drop-down list will be inactive and will
display ByColor.

Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw

If you want to avoid doing things the wrong way and getting yelled at by CAD
managers, don’t assign properties to objects in either of these ways:
 Don’t choose a specific color, linetype, lineweight, or plot style from the
appropriate drop-down list on the Object Properties toolbar, and then
draw the objects. 
 Don’t draw the objects, select them, and then choose a property from
the same drop-down lists. 
If you prefer to do things the right way, assign these properties by layer, as
we describe in this section. 
Creating new layers
If a suitable layer doesn’t exist, you need to create one by using the Layer
Properties Manager dialog box. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Layer button on the Layers toolbar; or type LAyer at the com-
mand line and press Enter.
The Layer Properties Manager dialog box appears. A new drawing has
only one layer, Layer 0. You need to add the layers necessary for your
drawing.
2. Click the New Layer button (the little yellow explosion just above the
Status column) to create a new layer.
A new layer appears. AutoCAD names it Layer1, but you can type a new
name to replace it easily, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5:
Adding a
new layer in
the Layer
Properties
Manager
dialog box.
110
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

3. Type a name for the new layer.
For the following reasons, type the layer name with initial caps (only the
first letter of words in uppercase) if you can: 
• Layer names written completely in uppercase are much wider,
which means that they often get truncated in the Layers toolbar’s
Layer drop-down list.
• Uppercase layer names look like they’re SHOUTING, which is not
very polite. 
4. On the same line as the new layer, click the color block or color name
(White) of the new layer.
The Select Color dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
The normal AutoCAD color scheme — AutoCAD Color Index (ACI) —
provides 255 colors. So many choices are nice for rendering work but
are overkill for ordinary drafting. 
For now, stick with the first nine colors — the ones that appear in a single,
separate row to the left of the ByLayer and ByBlock buttons on the Index
Color tab of the Select Color dialog box for the following reasons: 
• These colors are easy to distinguish from one another. 
• Using a small number of colors makes configuring your plot para-
meters easier. (We describe the procedure in Chapter 12.)
AutoCAD (but not AutoCAD LT) provides an even more extravagant set
of color choices than the 255 shown on the ACI tab. In the Select Color
dialog box, the True Color tab offers a choice of more than 16 million
colors, which you can specify by using HSL (Hue Saturation Luminance)
Figure 5-6:

Color dialog
box.

or RGB (Red Green Blue) numbers. The Color Book tab enables you to
use PANTONE and RAL color schemes, which are popular in publishing.
If your work requires tons of colors or close color matching between the
computer screen and printed output, you’re probably familiar with the
relevant color palette and how to use it. If you’re using AutoCAD for ordi-
nary drafting or design, stick with the AutoCAD Color Index palette.
5. Click a color to select it as the color for this layer; then click OK.
The Layer Properties Manager dialog box reappears. In the Name list, the
color for the new layer changes to either the name or the number of 
the color that you selected.
AutoCAD’s first seven colors have both assigned numbers and standard
names: 1 = red, 2 = yellow, 3 = green, 4 = cyan, 5 = blue, 6 = magenta, and
7 = white (but it appears black when displayed on a white background).
The remaining 248 colors have numbers only. You can play fashion
designer and make up your own names for these colors. How about
Overly Oxidized Ocher for color number 16?
6. On the same line as the new layer, click the Linetype name of the new
layer.
The default AutoCAD linetype is Continuous, which means no gaps in
the line.
The Select Linetype dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
If you already loaded the linetypes you need for your drawing, the Select
Linetype dialog box displays them in the Loaded Linetypes list. If not,
click the Load button to open the Load or Reload Linetypes dialog box.
By default, AutoCAD displays linetypes from the standard AutoCAD 2006
linetype definition file — acad.lin for imperial units drawings or
acadiso.lin for metric units drawings. Load the desired linetype by
selecting its name and clicking the OK button.
Figure 5-7:
The Select
Linetype
dialog box.
112
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Unless you have a really good reason (for example, your boss tells you
so), avoid loading or using any linetypes labeled ACAD_ISO. These line-
types are normally used only in metric drawings, and rarely even then.
They overrule everything we’re trying to show you about printed
lineweight in what follows, so if at all possible, just say NO to ACAD_ISO.
We promise, you’ll probably find it easier to use the linetypes with the
more descriptive names: CENTER, DASHED, and so on.
7. Click the desired linetype in the Select Linetype list to select it as the
linetype for the layer; then click OK.
The Select Linetype dialog box disappears, returning you to the Layer
Properties Manager dialog box. In the Name list, the linetype for the
selected layer changes to the linetype you just chose.
8. On the same line as the new layer, click the new layer’s lineweight.
The Lineweight dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-8.
9. Select the lineweight you want from the scrolling list; then click OK.
The lineweight 0.00 mm tells AutoCAD to use the thinnest possible
lineweight on the screen and on the plot. We recommend that, for now,
you leave lineweight set to Default and instead map screen color to plot-
ted lineweight, as described briefly in the “About colors and lineweights”
sidebar earlier in this chapter and in greater detail in Chapter 12. 
The default lineweight for the current drawing is defined in the Lineweight
Settings dialog box. After you close the Layer Properties Manager dialog
box, choose Format➪Lineweight or enter LWeight at the command line to
change the default lineweight.
Figure 5-8:
The
Lineweight
dialog box.
113
Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw

You use the plot style property to assign a named plot style to the layer,
but only if you’re using named plot styles in the drawing (Chapter 12
explains why you probably don’t want to). The final property, Plot, con-
trols whether the layer’s objects appear on plots. Toggle this setting
off for any layer whose objects you want to see on the screen but hide
on plots.
10. If you want to add a description to the layer, scroll the layer list to the
right to see the Description column, click twice in the Description box
corresponding to your new layer, and type a description.
If you choose to use layer descriptions, stretch the Layer Properties
Manager dialog box to the right so that you can see the descriptions
without having to scroll the layer list.
11. Repeat Steps 2 through 10 to create any other layers that you want. 
12. Select the new layer that you want to make current and click the Set
Current button (the green check mark).
The current layer is the one on which AutoCAD places new objects that
you draw.
13. Click OK to accept the new layer settings.
The Layer drop-down list on the Layers toolbar now displays your new
layer as the current layer.
After you create layers, you can set any one of them to be the current layer.
Make sure that no objects are selected, and then choose the layer name from
the Layer drop-down list on the Layers toolbar.
After you create layers and draw objects on them, you can turn a layer off
or on to hide or show the objects on that layer. In the Layer Properties
Manager dialog box, the first three icons to the right of the layer name con-
trol AutoCAD’s layer visibility modes:
 Off/On: Click the light bulb icon to toggle visibility of all objects on the
selected layer. AutoCAD does not regenerate the drawing when you turn
layers back on. (We give you the lowdown on regenerations in Chapter 8.)
 Freeze/Thaw: Click the sun icon to toggle off visibility of all objects on the
selected layer. Click the snowflake icon to toggle visibility on. AutoCAD
regenerates the drawing when you thaw layers.
 Lock/Unlock: Click the padlock icon to lock and unlock layers. When a
layer is locked, you can see but not edit objects on that layer.
114
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Off/On and Freeze/Thaw do almost the same thing — both settings let you
make objects visible or invisible by layer. In the old days, turning layers off
and on was often a faster process than thawing frozen layers because thaw-
ing layers always required regenerating the drawing. But modern computers,
modern operating systems, and recent AutoCAD versions make regenerations
much less of an issue on all but the largest drawings. You’ll probably find it
makes no appreciable difference whether you freeze and thaw layers or turn
them off and on.
You can turn layers off and on, freeze and thaw them, and lock and unlock
them by clicking the appropriate icons in the Layer drop-down list on the
Layers toolbar.
115
Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw
A load of linetypes
Our layer creation procedure demonstrates
how to load a single linetype, but AutoCAD
comes with a whole lot of linetypes, and there
are other ways of working with them. You 
don’t have to go through the Layer Properties
Manager dialog box to load linetypes. You can
perform the full range of linetype management
tasks by choosing Format➪Linetype, which dis-
plays the Linetype Manager dialog box. This
dialog box is similar to the Select Linetype
dialog box described in the layer creation pro-
cedure, but it includes some additional options.
After you click the Load button to display the
Load or Reload Linetypes dialog box, you can
load multiple linetypes in one fell swoop by
holding down the Shift or Ctrl key while you click
linetype names. As in most Windows dialog
boxes, Shift+click selects all objects between
the first and second clicks, and Ctrl+click
enables you to select multiple objects, even if
they aren’t next to each other.
When you load a linetype, AutoCAD copies its
linetype definition — a recipe for how to create
the dashes, dots, and gaps in that particu-
lar linetype — from the acad.lin (imperial
units) or acadiso.lin (metric units) file into
the drawing. The recipe doesn’t automatically
appear in other drawings; you have to load each
linetype that you want to use into each drawing
in which you want to use it. If you find yourself
loading the same linetypes repeatedly into dif-
ferent drawings, consider adding them to your
template drawings instead. (See Chapter 4 for
information about templates and how to create
them.) After you add linetypes to a template
drawing, all new drawings that you create from
that template will start with those linetypes
loaded automatically.
Don’t go overboard on loading linetypes. For
example, you don’t need to load all the linetypes
in the acad.lin file on the off chance that you
might use them all someday. The resulting line-
type list would be long and unwieldy. Most
drawings require only a few linetypes, and most
industries and companies settle on a half dozen
or so linetypes for common use. Your industry,
office, or project may have guidelines about
which linetypes to use for which purposes.
If you’re the creative type and don’t mind edit-
ing a text file that contains linetype definitions,
you can define your own linetypes. Choose
Contents➪Customization Guide➪Custom Line-
types in the AutoCAD 2006 online help system.

If you find yourself using lots of layers, you can create layer filters to make
viewing and managing the layer list easier. AutoCAD provides two kinds of
layer filters: group and property. A group filter is simply a subset of layers
that you choose (by dragging layer names into the group filter name or by
selecting objects in the drawing). A property filter is a subset of layers that
AutoCAD creates and updates automatically based on layer property criteria
that you define (for example, all layers whose names contain the text “Wall”
or whose color is green). To find out more, click the Help button on the Layer
Properties Manager dialog box and read about the New Property Filter and
New Group Filter buttons.
Using AutoCAD DesignCenter
DesignCenter is a dumb name for a useful, if somewhat busy, palette. (Chapter 2
describes how to turn on and work with palettes.) The DesignCenter palette
is handy for mining data from all kinds of drawings. Whereas the Properties
palette, described earlier in this chapter, is concerned with object properties,
the DesignCenter palette deals primarily with named objects: layers, line-
types, block (that is, symbol) definitions, text styles, and other organizational
objects in your drawings.
Named objects
Every drawing includes a set of symbol tables, which contain named objects.
For example, the layer table contains a list of the layers in the current draw-
ing, along with the settings for each layer (color, linetype, on/off setting, and
so on). Each of these table objects, be it a layer or some other type, has a
name, so Autodesk decided to call them named objects (duh!).
Neither the symbol tables nor the named objects appear as graphical objects
in your drawing. They’re like hardworking stagehands who keep the show
running smoothly behind the scenes. The named objects include
 Layers (this chapter)
 Linetypes (this chapter)
 Text styles (Chapter 9)
 Dimension styles (Chapter 10)
116
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 Block definitions and xrefs (Chapter 13)
 Layouts (Chapter 4)
When you use commands such as LAyer, LineType, and Dimstyle, you are cre-
ating and editing named objects. After you’ve created named objects in a
drawing, DesignCenter gives you the tools to copy them to other drawings.
Getting (Design)Centered
The DesignCenter palette (shown in Figure 5-9) consists of a toolbar at the
top, a set of tabs below that, a navigation pane on the left, and a content pane
on the right. The navigation pane displays a tree view with drawing files and
the symbol tables contained in each drawing. The content pane usually dis-
plays the contents of the drawing or symbol table.

117
Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw

The four tabs just below the DesignCenter toolbar control what you see in
the navigation and content panes:
 Folders: This tab shows the folders on your local and network disks,
just like the Windows Explorer Folders pane does. Use this tab to copy
named objects from drawings that you don’t currently have open in
AutoCAD.
 Open Drawings: This tab shows the drawings that are open in AutoCAD.
Use this tab to copy named objects between open drawings.
 History: This tab shows drawings that you’ve recently browsed in
DesignCenter. Use this tab to jump quickly to drawings that you’ve used
recently on the Folders tab.
 DC Online: This tab shows parts libraries that are available on Autodesk’s
and other companies’ Web sites. This tab is essentially an advertising
vehicle for software companies offering to sell you symbol libraries and
manufacturers encouraging you to specify their products. Browse the
offerings on this tab to see whether any of the online libraries can be
useful in your work.
The toolbar buttons further refine what you see in the navigation and content
panes. A few of these buttons toggle off and on different parts of the panes. 
Follow these steps to use DesignCenter:
1. If it isn’t already, open DesignCenter by choosing Tools➪DesignCenter.
You can also click DesignCenter on the Standard toolbar or press Ctrl+2.
2. Load the drawing(s) whose content you want to view or use into the
navigation pane on the left.
If a drawing doesn’t appear on the Open Drawings tab, click the Load
button — the first one on the DesignCenter toolbar — to load it into the
navigation pane.
3. Navigate the symbol tables (such as blocks and layers), viewing their
individual named objects in the content pane on the right.
4. If you need them, drag or copy and paste individual named objects
from the content pane into other open AutoCAD drawings.
Copying layers between drawings
The following steps copy layers from one drawing to another using
DesignCenter. You can use the same technique to copy dimension styles, 
layouts, linetypes, and text styles.
118
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

1. Toggle the DesignCenter palette on by clicking the DesignCenter button
on the Standard toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+2.
2. Open or create a drawing containing named objects you want to copy.
You can also use the Folders tab, the Open button, or the Search button
to load a drawing into DesignCenter without opening it in AutoCAD.
3. Open or create a second drawing to which you want to copy the
named objects.
4. Click the Open Drawings tab to display your two currently opened
drawings in DesignCenter’s navigation pane on the left.
If you used the Folders tab, the Open button, or the Search button in
Step 2, skip this step; DesignCenter already displays the drawing you
selected on the Folders tab.
5. If DesignCenter doesn’t display the symbol tables indented under-
neath the source drawing (the one you opened in Step 2), as shown in
Figure 5-9, click the plus sign next to the drawing’s name to display
them.
6. Click the Layers table to display the source drawing’s layers in the
content pane.
7. Choose one or more layers in the content pane.
8. Right-click in the content pane and choose Copy from the menu to
copy the layer(s) to the Windows Clipboard.
9. Click in the AutoCAD destination drawing’s window (the drawing that
you opened in Step 3).
10. Right-click and choose Paste from the menu.
AutoCAD copies the layers into the current drawing, using the colors,
linetypes, and other settings from the source drawing.
From DesignCenter, you can copy layers in two other ways. You can drag
layers from the content pane to a drawing window. You can also right-click in
the content pane and choose Add Layer(s) from the menu, which adds layers
to the current drawing. The copy-and-paste method in our example requires
the least amount of manual dexterity and less guesswork about which draw-
ing the layers get added to.
If the current drawing contains a layer whose name matches the name of one
of the layers you’re copying, AutoCAD doesn’t change that layer’s definition.
For example, if you drag a layer named Doors whose color is red into a draw-
ing that already includes a layer called Doors whose color is green, the target
drawing’s Doors layer remains green. Named objects from DesignCenter
never overwrite objects with the same name in the destination drawing.
AutoCAD always displays the message “Duplicate definitions will be ignored”
even if there aren’t any duplicates.
119
Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw

If you’re repeatedly copying named objects from the same drawings or fold-
ers, add them to your DesignCenter favorites list. On the Folders tab, right-
click the drawing or folder and choose Add to Favorites from the menu. This
procedure adds another shortcut to your list of favorites. 
 To see your favorites, click the DesignCenter toolbar’s Favorites button.
 To return to a favorite, double-click its shortcut in the content pane.
Precise-liness Is Next to CAD-liness
Drawing precision is vital to good CAD drafting practice, even more than for
manual drafting. If you think CAD managers get testy when you assign proper-
ties by object instead of by layer, wait until they berate someone who doesn’t
use precision techniques when creating drawings in AutoCAD.
In CAD, lack of precision makes later editing, hatching, and dimensioning
tasks much more difficult and time consuming: 
 Small errors in precision in the early stages of creating or editing a draw-
ing often have a big effect on productivity and precision later. 
 Drawings may guide manufacturing and construction projects; drawing
data may drive automatic manufacturing machinery. Huge amounts of
money, even lives, can ride on a drawing’s precision. 
120
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
CAD precision versus accuracy
We often use the words precision and accu-
racy interchangeably, but we think it’s useful to
maintain a distinction. When we use the word
precision, we mean controlling the placement
of objects so they lie exactly where you want
them to lie in the drawing. For example, lines
whose endpoints meet must meet exactly, and a
circle that’s supposed to be centered on the
coordinates 0,0 must be drawn with its center
exactly at 0,0. We use accuracy to refer to the
degree to which your drawing matches its real-
world counterpart. An accurate floor plan is one
in which the dimensions of the CAD objects
equal the dimensions of the as-built house.
CAD precision usually helps produce accurate
drawings, but that’s not always the case. You
can produce a precise CAD drawing that’s inac-
curate because you started from inaccurate
information (for example, the contractor gave
you a wrong field measurement). Or you might
deliberately exaggerate certain distances to
convey the relationship between objects more
clearly on the plotted drawing. Even where you
must sacrifice accuracy, aim for precision.

In recognition of this, a passion for precision permeates the profession.
Permanently. Precision is one of the characteristics that separates CAD from
ordinary illustration-type drawing work. The sooner you get fussy about pre-
cision in AutoCAD, the happier everyone is.
In the context of drawing objects, to use precision means to designate points
and distances exactly, and AutoCAD provides a range of tools for doing so.
Table 5-2 lists the more important AutoCAD precision techniques, plus the
status bar buttons that you click to toggle some of the features off and on.
Precision is especially important when you’re drawing or editing geometry —
the lines, arcs, and so on that make up whatever you’re representing in the
CAD drawing. Precision placement usually is less important with notes, lead-
ers, and other annotations that describe, not show.

needs. 
 A button that looks pushed in indicates that the feature is on.
 A button that looks popped up indicates that the feature is off.
AutoCAD LT lacks the object snap tracking feature of the full version of
AutoCAD.
Keyboard capers: Coordinate entry
The most direct way to enter points precisely is to type numbers at the key-
board. AutoCAD uses these keyboard coordinate entry formats:
 Absolute rectangular coordinates in the form X,Y (for example: 7,4)
 Relative rectangular coordinates in the form @X,Y (for example: @3,2)
 Relative polar coordinates in the form @distance<angle (for example:
@6<45)
AutoCAD locates absolute rectangular coordinates with respect to the 0,0 point
of the drawing — usually its lower-left corner. AutoCAD locates relative rec-
tangular coordinates and relative polar coordinates with respect to the previ-
ous point that you picked or typed. Figure 5-10 demonstrates how to use all
three coordinate formats to draw a pair of line segments that start at absolute
coordinates 2,1; go 3 units to the right and 2 units up; then go 4 units at an
angle of 60 degrees.
AutoCAD also understands absolute polar coordinates in the form
distance<angle, but this format is almost never useful.
You can view coordinate locations by moving the cursor around in the 
drawing area and reading the Coordinates area at the left of the status bar.
Depending on AutoCAD 2006’s dynamic input settings, you may also see the
coordinate locations next to the crosshairs. The X,Y coordinates should
change as you move the cursor. If the coordinates don’t change, click the
Coordinates area until the command line says <Coords on>. Although it’s
not apparent at first, there are in fact two <Coords on> display modes:
absolute coordinates and polar coordinates. If you start a command such as
LINE, pick a point, and then click the Coordinates area a few times, the dis-
play changes from coordinates off to live absolute coordinates (X,Y position)
to live polar coordinates (distance and angle from the previous point). The
live polar coordinates display mode is the most informative most of the time.
122
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

When you type coordinates at the command line, do not add any spaces,
because AutoCAD interprets them as though you’ve pressed Enter. This
“Spacebar = Enter” weirdness is a productivity feature that’s been in
AutoCAD forever. It’s easier to find the spacebar than the Enter key when
you’re entering lots of commands and coordinates in a hurry.
If you’re working in architectural or engineering units, the default unit of
entry is inches, not feet:
 To specify feet, you must enter the symbol for feet after the number, for
example:
6' for 6 feet
 You can enter a dash to separate feet from inches, as architects often do:
6'–6" is 6 feet, 6 inches.

 Both the dash and the inch mark are optional when you’re entering coor-
dinates and distances: 
AutoCAD understands 6'6" and 6'6 as the same as 6'–6".
 If you’re typing a coordinate or distance that contains fractional inches,
you must enter a dash — not a space — between the whole number of
inches and the fraction:
6'6–1/2 (or 6'–6–1/2) represents 6 feet, 61⁄2 inches.
 If all this dashing about confuses you, enter partial inches by using deci-
mals instead:
6'6.5 is the same as 6'6–1/2 to AutoCAD, whether you’re working in
architectural or engineering units.
Grab an object and make it snappy
After you’ve drawn a few objects precisely in a new drawing, the most effi-
cient way to draw more objects with equal precision is to grab points, such as
endpoints, midpoints, or quadrants, on the existing objects. AutoCAD calls
this object snapping, because the program pulls, or snaps, the cursor to a
point on an existing object. The object snapping feature in general, and object
snap points in particular, often are called osnaps.
I’d like to make just one point
AutoCAD provides two kinds of object snapping modes: 
 Single point (or override) object snaps: A single point object snap lasts
just while you pick one point. 
 Running object snaps: A running object snap stays in effect until you
turn it off.
Here’s how you draw precise lines by using single point object snaps:
1. Open a drawing containing some geometry.
2. Turn off running osnap mode by clicking the OSNAP button on the
status bar until the button appears to be pushed out and the words
<Osnap off> appear on the command line.
Although you can use single point object snaps while running object
snap mode is turned on, you should turn off running osnap mode while
you’re getting familiar with single point object snaps. After you’ve gotten
the hang of each feature separately, you can use them together.
124
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

3. Start the LINE command by clicking the Line button on the Draw 
toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you to select the first endpoint of the line:
Specify first point:
4. Hold down the Shift key, right-click anywhere in the drawing area,
and release the Shift key.
If you find the Shift+right-click sequence awkward, you can avoid it by
using the Object Snap toolbar instead. To turn the toolbar on, point to
any toolbar button, right-click, and choose Object Snap. Now you can
activate a single point object snap by clicking its toolbar button.
If you Shift+right-click, the object snap menu appears, as shown in
Figure 5-11.
5. Choose an object snap mode, such as Endpoint, from the object snap
menu.
The object snap menu disappears, and the command line displays an
additional prompt indicating that you’ve directed AutoCAD to seek out,
for example, endpoints of existing objects:
_endp of:
6. Move the cursor slowly around the drawing, pausing over various
lines and other objects without clicking yet.
When you move the cursor near an object with an endpoint, a colored
square icon appears at the endpoint, indicating that AutoCAD can snap
Figure 5-11:
The object

click menu.
125
Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw

to that point. If you stop moving the cursor for a moment, a tooltip dis-
playing the object snap mode (for example, Endpoint) appears to rein-
force the idea.
7. When the endpoint object snap square appears on the point you want
to snap to, click.
AutoCAD snaps to the endpoint, which becomes the first point of the
new line segment that you’re about to draw. The command line prompts
you to select the other endpoint of the new line segment:
Specify next point or [Undo]:
When you move the cursor around the drawing, AutoCAD no longer
seeks out endpoints because single point object snaps last only for a
single pick. Use the object snap right-click menu again to snap the other
end of your new line segment to another point on an existing object.
8. Use the “press Shift, right-click, release Shift” sequence described in
Step 4 to display the object snap menu, and then choose another
object snap mode, such as Midpoint, from the object snap menu.
The command line displays an additional prompt indicating that you’ve
directed AutoCAD to seek, for example, midpoints of existing objects:
_mid of:
When you move the cursor near the midpoint of an object, a colored tri-
angle appears at the snap point. Each object snap type (endpoint, mid-
point, intersection, and so on) displays a different symbol. If you stop
moving the cursor, the tooltip text reminds you what the symbol means.
Figure 5-12 shows what the screen looks like during this step.
9. Draw additional line segments by picking additional points. Use the
object snap right-click menu to specify a single object snap type before
you pick each point.
Try the Intersection, Perpendicular, and Nearest object snaps. If your
drawing contains arcs or circles, try Center and Quadrant.
10. When you’re finished experimenting with single point object snaps,
right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Enter from the
menu to end the LINE command.
There’s a difference between right-clicking and Shift+right-clicking in the
drawing area:
• Right-clicking displays menu options for the current command (or
common commands and settings when no command is active).
• Shift+right-clicking always displays the same object snap menu.
126
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Run with object snaps
Often, you use an object snap mode (such as endpoint) repeatedly. Running
object snaps address this need. These steps set a running object snap:
1. Right-click the OSNAP button on the status bar.
2. Choose the Settings option.
The Object Snap tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 5-13.
3. Select one or more object snap modes by checking the appropriate
boxes.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.

127
Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw

You click the OSNAP button on the status bar to toggle running object snap
mode off and on. After you turn on running object snap, AutoCAD hunts for
points that correspond to the object snap modes you checked in the Drafting
Settings dialog box. As with single point object snaps, AutoCAD displays a
special symbol — such as a square for an endpoint object snap — to indicate
that it has found an object snap point. If you keep the cursor still, AutoCAD
also displays a tooltip that lists the kind of object snap point.
Use single point or running object snaps to enforce precision by making sure
that new points you pick coincide exactly with points on existing objects. In
CAD, it’s not good enough for points to almost coincide or to look like they
coincide. AutoCAD knows the difference between “looks the same” and “is
the same” and will cause you untold amounts of grief if you try to make do
with “looks the same.” You lose points, both figuratively and literally, if you
don’t use object snaps or one of the other precision techniques covered in
this chapter to enforce precision.
Most, but not all, single point object snaps have running object snap equiva-
lents. For example, Endpoint, Midpoint, and Center work as either single
point or running object snaps, but Mid Between 2 Points only works in single
point mode.
Other precision practices
The following are some other AutoCAD precision techniques (refer to
Table 5-2, earlier in this chapter):
Figure 5-13:

128
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 Snap: If you turn on snap mode, AutoCAD constrains the cursor to an
imaginary rectangular grid of points at the spacing that you’ve specified.
Follow these steps to turn on snap mode:
1. Right-click the SNAP button on the status bar.
2. Choose the Settings option.
The Snap and Grid tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box appears.
3. Enter a snap spacing in the Snap X Spacing field, and then
click OK.
Click the SNAP button on the status bar or Press F9 to toggle snap mode
off and on. To use snap effectively, change the snap spacing frequently —
changing to a smaller spacing as you zoom in and work on smaller areas.
You often need to toggle snap off and on because selecting objects and
some editing tasks are easier with snap off.
 Ortho: Ortho mode constrains the cursor to move at right angles (ortho-
gonally) to the previous point. Click the ORTHO button on the status bar
or Press F8 to toggle ortho mode off and on. Because technical drawings
often include lots of orthogonal lines, you’ll use ortho mode a lot.
 Direct distance entry: This “point and type” technique is an easy and
efficient way to draw with precision. You simply point the cursor in a
particular direction, type a distance at the command line, and press
Enter. AutoCAD calls it direct distance entry because it avoids the indirect
keyboard method of specifying a distance by typing relative or polar
coordinates. (We describe this older method earlier in this chapter.) You
can use direct distance entry any time the crosshair cursor is anchored
to a point and the command line or dynamic cursor prompts you for
another point or a distance. You’ll usually use direct distance entry with
ortho mode turned on, to specify a distance in an orthogonal direction
(0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees). You also can combine direct distance entry
with polar tracking to specify distances in non-orthogonal directions
(for example, in angle increments of 45 degrees).
 Object snap tracking: This feature extends running object snaps so that
you can locate points based on more than one object snap point. For
example, you can pick a point at the center of a square by tracking to
the midpoints of two perpendicular sides. (AutoCAD LT lacks the object
snap tracking feature.)
 Polar tracking: When you turn on polar tracking, the cursor jumps to
increments of the angle you selected. When the cursor jumps, a tooltip
label starting with Polar: appears. Right-click the POLAR button on the
status bar and choose the Settings option to display the Polar Tracking
tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box. Select an angle from the Increment
Angle drop-down list, and then click OK. Click the POLAR button on the
status bar or press F10 to toggle polar tracking mode off and on.
129
Chapter 5: Get Ready to Draw

 Polar snap: You can force polar tracking to jump to specific incremental
distances along the tracking angles by changing the snap type from Grid
snap to Polar snap. For example, if you turn on polar tracking and set it
to 45 degrees and turn on polar snap and set it to 2 units, polar tracking
jumps to points that are at angle increments of 45 degrees and distance
increments of 2 units from the previous point. Polar snap has a similar
effect on object snap tracking.
To activate polar snap, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the SNAP button on the status bar.
2. Choose the Settings option.
The Snap and Grid tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box appears.
3. Click the Polar Snap radio button, type a distance in the Polar
Distance text box, and then click OK.
When you want to return to ordinary rectangular snap, as described at
the beginning of this list, select the Grid Snap radio button in the
Drafting Settings dialog box.
 Temporary overrides: Settings such as SNAP, ORTHO, and POLAR remain
on until you turn them off. AutoCAD 2006 introduces an alternative called
temporary overrides, which last only as long as you hold down their key or
key combination. For example, with Ortho turned off, holding down the
Shift key puts AutoCAD into a temporary Ortho mode for as long as you
press Shift. For additional information, look up “temporary override keys”
in the online Help system. 
If you’re new to AutoCAD, its wide range of precision tools probably seems
overwhelming at this point. Rest assured that there’s more than one way to
skin a cat precisely, and not everyone needs to understand all the ways. You
can make perfectly precise drawings with a subset of AutoCAD’s precision
tools. We recommend these steps: 
1. Get comfortable with typing coordinates, ortho mode, direct distance
entry, and single point object snaps. 
2. Become familiar with running object snaps and try Snap mode. 
3. After you have all these precision features under your belt, feel free to
experiment with polar tracking, polar snap, and object snap tracking.
It’s easy to confuse the names of the snap and object snap (osnap) features.
Remember that snap limits the cursor to locations whose coordinates are
multiples of the current snap spacing. Object snap (osnap) enables you to
grab points on existing objects, whether those points happen to correspond
with the snap spacing or not.

A
s you probably remember from your crayon and coloring book days,
drawing stuff is fun. CAD imposes a little more discipline, but drawing
AutoCAD objects is still fun. In computer-aided drafting, you usually start by
drawing geometry — shapes such as lines, circles, rectangles, and so on —
that represent the real-world object that you’re documenting. This chapter
shows you how to draw geometry.
After you’ve created some geometry, you’ll probably need to add some
dimensions, text, and hatching, but those elements come later (in Part III of
this book). Your first task is to get the geometry right; then you can worry
about labeling things.
Drawing geometry properly in AutoCAD depends on paying attention to object
properties and the precision of the points that you specify to create the
objects. We cover these matters in Chapter 5, so if you eagerly jumped to this
chapter to get right to the fun stuff, take a moment to review that chapter first.

Introducing the AutoCAD
Drawing Commands
For descriptive purposes, this chapter divides the drawing commands into
three groups:
 Straight lines and objects composed of straight lines
 Curves
 Points
Table 6-1 offers an overview of most of the drawing commands in AutoCAD,
without the 3D-related commands. It describes the commands’ major options
and shows you how to access them from the command line, the Draw menu,
and the Draw toolbar. (Don’t worry if not all the terms in the table are famil-
iar to you; they become clear as you read through the chapter and use the
commands.)

Many of the choices on the AutoCAD Draw menu open submenus containing
several variations on each drawing command.
AutoCAD’s drawing commands are highly interactive. You need to read and
respond to the prompts at the dynamic cursor or the command line area. (If
“command line area” sounds to you like a place to order cafeteria food, not
an AutoCAD essential concept, see Chapter 2.) Many of the command options
that you see in command line prompts are available as well by pressing the
up- and down-arrow keys to display the options at the dynamic cursor. You
can also right-click and select command options from the context-specific
shortcut menu.
AutoCAD 2006’s Dynamic Input system displays a lot of the information that
you used to have to look down to the command line area to see. To use the
new system, make sure the DYN button on the status bar is pressed in. You’ll
still need to look at the command line some of the time, but not nearly as
much as you do in earlier versions of AutoCAD.
133
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

So what’s the best course: to enter drawing commands from the command
line or to choose them from the menus or toolbars? We suggest that you start
a drawing command the first few times by clicking its button on the Draw
toolbar — until you remember its command name. After you click the button,
fasten your eyes on the command line area so that you see the name of the
command and its command line options. Use the keyboard or the right-click
menus to select options, depending on whether your hand is on the keyboard
or the mouse at that moment. After you’re acquainted with a drawing com-
mand and decide that you like it enough to use it often, find out how to type its
keyboard shortcut (the uppercase letters in the command names in Table 6-1).
A few drawing commands, such as DOnut, aren’t on the Draw toolbar; you
have to type those or choose them from the Draw menu.
The Straight and Narrow: Lines,
Polylines, and Polygons
As we harp on a bunch of times elsewhere in this book, CAD programs are for
precision drawing, so you’ll spend a lot of your AutoCAD time drawing objects
composed of straight-line segments. This section covers these commands:
 Line: Draws a series of straight line segments; each segment is a sepa-
rate object
 PLine: Draws a polyline — a series of straight and/or curved line seg-
ments; all the segments remain connected to each other as a single
object
 RECtang: Draws a polyline in the shape of a rectangle
 POLygon: Draws a polyline in the shape of a regular polygon (that is, a
closed shape with all sides equal and all angles equal)
The following additional straight-line drawing commands also are available in
AutoCAD:
 RAY: Draws a semi-infinite line (a line that extends infinitely in one 
direction)
 XLine: Draws an infinite line (a line that extends infinitely in both 
directions)
134
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The RAY and XLine commands are used to draw construction lines that guide
the construction of additional geometry. Drawing construction lines is less
common in AutoCAD than in some other CAD programs. AutoCAD’s many
precision techniques often provide more efficient methods than construction
lines of creating new geometry.
Toe the line
The Line command in AutoCAD draws a series of one or more connected line
segments. Well, it appears to draw a series of connected segments. In fact,
each segment, or piece of a line with endpoints, is a separate object. This con-
struction doesn’t seem like a big deal until you try to move or otherwise edit
a series of segments that you drew with the Line command; you must select
every piece separately. To avoid such a hassle, use polylines (described later
in this chapter), not lines and arcs, when you want the connected segments
to be a single object.
If you’re used to drawing lines in other programs, you may find it confusing at
first that AutoCAD’s Line command doesn’t stop after you draw a single seg-
ment. AutoCAD keeps prompting you to specify additional points so that you
can draw a series of (apparently) connected segments. When you’re finished
drawing segments, just press the Enter key to finish the Line command. 
Unlike a lot of AutoCAD drawing commands, Line doesn’t offer a bunch of
potentially confusing options. There’s a Close option to create a closed poly-
gon and an Undo option to remove the most recent segment that you drew.
Like all drawing commands, Line puts the line segment objects that it draws
on the current layer, and uses the current color, linetype, lineweight, and plot
style properties.
 Make sure that you’ve set these properties correctly before you start
drawing. (We recommend that you set color, linetype, lineweight, and
plot style to ByLayer.) See Chapter 5 for information on setting the cur-
rent properties with the Object Properties toolbar.
 When you’re doing real drafting as opposed to just experimenting, make
sure that you use one of AutoCAD’s precision tools, such as object snaps,
typed coordinates, or tracking, to ensure that you specify each object
point precisely. Chapter 5 describes these tools.
Follow these steps to draw a series of line segments by using the Line 
command:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the line segments that you’ll draw.
135
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

2. Click the Line button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the Line command and prompts you:
Specify first point:
3. Specify the starting point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
Remember to use one of the precision techniques described in Chapter 5
if you’re doing real drafting. For the first point, object snap, snap, track-
ing, and typing coordinates all work well.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the other endpoint of the first line seg-
ment. The command line shows:
Specify next point or [Undo]:
You can also see command prompts at the Dynamic Input cursor by
pressing the down-arrow key. The arrow icon on the dynamic cursor
tooltip is your indicator that that are options available.
4. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
Again, use one of the AutoCAD precision techniques if you’re doing real
drafting. For the second and subsequent points, all the techniques men-
tioned in the previous step work well, plus ortho and direct distance
entry.
After you specify the third point, AutoCAD adds the Close option. The
command line shows:
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
5. When you’re finished drawing segments, end with one of these steps:
• Press Enter, or right-click anywhere in the drawing area and
choose Enter (as shown in Figure 6-1), to leave the figure open.
• Type C and press Enter, or press the down arrow on your keyboard
and choose Close from the menu, to close the figure.
AutoCAD draws the final segment. The command prompt indicates that
the Line command is finished:
Command:
Connect the lines with polyline
The Line command is fine for some drawing tasks, but the PLine command is
a better, more flexible choice in many situations. The PLine command draws
a special kind of object called a polyline. You may hear CAD drafters refer to a
polyline as a pline because of the command name. (By the way, PLine is pro-
nounced to rhyme with “beeline” — in other words, it sounds like the place
you stand when you’ve drunk a lot of beer at the ball game.)
136
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

The most important differences between the Line and PLine commands are
these:
 The Line command draws a series of single line segment objects. Even
though they appear on the screen to be linked, each segment is a sepa-
rate object. If you move one line segment, the other segments that you
drew at the same time don’t move with it. The PLine command, on the
other hand, draws a single, connected, multisegment object. If you
select any segment for editing, your changes affect the entire polyline.
Figure 6-2 shows how the same sketch drawn with the Line and the
PLine commands responds when you select one of the objects.
Use the PLine command instead of Line in most cases where you need to
draw a series of connected line segments. If you’re drawing a series of
end-to-end segments, there’s a good chance that those segments are log-
ically connected — for example, they might represent the outline of a
single object or a continuous pathway. If the segments are connected
logically, it makes sense to keep them connected in AutoCAD. The most
obvious practical benefit of grouping segments together into a polyline
is that many editing operations are more efficient when you use poly-
lines. When you select any segment in a polyline for editing, the entire
polyline is affected.
Figure 6-1:
Line it up —

137
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

 The PLine command can draw curved segments as well as straight ones.
 You can add width to each segment of a polyline. Polyline segment width
is visually similar to lineweight, except that polyline segment width can
be uniform or tapered. The ability to create polyline segments with line
widths was more important in the old days before AutoCAD had
lineweight as an object property. People used to draw polylines with a
small amount of width to show the segments as somewhat heavier than
normal on plots. Nowadays, it’s easier and more efficient to achieve this
effect with object lineweights (as described in Chapter 5) or plot styles
(as described in Chapter 12).
After you create a polyline, you can adjust its segments by grip editing any of
the vertex points. (The little squares on the vertices in Figure 6-2 are called
grips; see Chapter 7 for details on grip editing.) For more complicated poly-
line editing tasks, you can use the PEdit command to edit the polyline, or you
can convert the polyline to a collection of line and arc segments by using the
eXplode command — although you lose any width defined for each segment
when you explode a polyline.
Drawing polylines composed of straight segments is pretty much like drawing
with the Line command, as demonstrated in the following procedure. The
PLine command has lots of options, so watch the prompts! Use the down-
arrow key to see the options listed at the cursor, or right-click to display the
PLine shortcut menu, or simply read the command line.

Polyline (all segments form one object)

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

To draw a polyline composed of straight segments, follow these steps:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the polyline object that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Polyline button — the one that looks like a fishhook — on
the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the PLine command and prompts you:
Specify start point:
3. Specify the starting point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
AutoCAD displays the current polyline segment line-width at the com-
mand line and prompts you to specify the other endpoint of the first
polyline segment:
Current line-width is 0.0000
Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]:
4. If the current line width isn’t zero, change it to zero by typing W, Enter,
0, Enter, 0, Enter (as shown in the following command line sequence).
Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]: W
Enter Specify starting width <0.0000>: 0
Enter Specify ending width <0.0000>: 0
Enter Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/
Width]:
Despite what you may think, a zero width polyline segment is not the
AutoCAD equivalent of writing with disappearing ink. Zero width means
“display this segment, using the normal, thin line width on the screen.”
AutoCAD still applies object property or plot style lineweights when
you plot.
5. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
After you specify the second point, AutoCAD adds the Close option to
the prompt. The command line shows:
Specify next point or [Arc/Close/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/
Width]:
In addition, you can view and choose options from the dynamic cursor
menu, as shown in Figure 6-3.
6. After you finish drawing segments, either press Enter (to leave the
figure open) or type C and press Enter (to close it).
AutoCAD draws the final segment. The command prompt indicates that
the PLine command is finished:
Command:

Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

In the following procedure, we spice things up a bit and give you a preview of
coming (curvy) attractions by adding an arc segment to a polyline.
Just so you know, curved segments in polylines are circular arcs — pieces of
circles that you can draw with the AutoCAD Arc command. AutoCAD can
draw other kinds of curves, including ellipses and splines, but not within the
PLine command.
To draw a polyline that includes curved segments, follow these steps:
1. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 of the previous procedure.
2. When you’re ready to add one or more arc segments, type A and
press Enter to select the Arc option.
The prompt changes to show arc segment options. Most of these options
correspond to the many ways of drawing circular arcs in AutoCAD; see
the “Arc-y-ology” section, later in this chapter. The command line shows:
Specify endpoint of arc or [Angle/CEnter/CLose/Direction/
Halfwidth/Line/Radius/Second pt/Undo/Width]:
3. Specify the endpoint of the arc by clicking a point or typing 
coordinates.
AutoCAD draws the curved segment of the polyline. The prompts con-
tinue to show arc segment options.
Figure 6-3:

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Specify endpoint of arc or [Angle/CEnter/CLose/Direction/
Halfwidth/Line/Radius/Second pt/Undo/Width]:
Your options at this point include
• Specifying additional points to draw more arc segments
• Choosing another arc-drawing method (such as CEnter or Second pt)
• Returning to drawing straight-line segments with the Line option
In this example, we return to drawing straight-line segments.
Perhaps the most useful of the alternative arc-drawing methods is Second
pt. You can use it to gain flexibility in the direction of the arc, but at the
cost of losing tangency of contiguous segments. Sometimes it’s best not
to go off on a tangent, anyway.
4. Type L and press Enter to select the Line option.
Specify endpoint of arc or [Angle/CEnter/CLose/Direction/
Halfwidth/Line/Radius/Second pt/Undo/Width]: L
The prompt changes back to showing straight-line segment options.
Specify next point or [Arc/Close/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/

5. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
6. After you’re finished drawing segments, either press Enter or type C
and press Enter.

Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

The Line and PLine commands work well for drawing a series of end-to-end
single lines, but what if you want to draw a series of double lines to repre-
sent, for example, the edges of a wall or roadway? Here are some options:
 Use the AutoCAD MLine command to draw multilines — series of two or
more parallel straight lines. The AutoCAD multiline feature was full of
limitations when it debuted over a decade ago, and despite some minor
tweaks in AutoCAD 2006, it hasn’t improved significantly since then.
Look up the MLine and MLSTYLE commands in AutoCAD’s online help
system if you’d like to tangle with this feature, but be prepared to spend
time experimenting and struggling.
 In AutoCAD LT only, use the DLine (Double Line) command to draw pairs
of parallel line and/or arc segments. AutoCAD LT doesn’t include the
MLine command, which, given MLine’s problems, probably is more of a
blessing than a limitation. AutoCAD, on the other hand, doesn’t include
the DLine command. (Score one for the little brother!)
 Use the PLine command to draw a single set of connected line and/or
arc segments, and then use the Offset command to create one or more
sets of parallel segments. Chapter 7 covers the Offset command.
Square off with rectangle
You can use the PLine or Line command to draw a rectangle segment by seg-
ment. In most cases, though, you’ll find it easier to use the special-purpose
RECtang command. The following procedure demonstrates how:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the rectangle that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Rectangle button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the RECtang command and prompts you to specify a
point for one corner of the rectangle. The command line shows:
Specify first corner point or [Chamfer/Elevation/Fillet/
Thickness/Width]:
You can add fancy effects with the additional command options. The
default options work best for most purposes. Look up “RECTANG com-
mand” in the AutoCAD help system if you want to know more about the
options.
3. Specify the first corner by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the other corner of the rectangle — the
one that’s diagonally opposite from the first corner:
Specify other corner point or [Area/Dimensions/Rotation]:
142
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

4. Specify the other corner by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
If you know the size of the rectangle that you want to draw (for example,
100 units long by 75 units high), type relative coordinates to specify the
dimensions (for example, @100,75). (Chapter 5 describes how to type
coordinates.)
AutoCAD draws the rectangle.
Unlike the neglected MLine command, the RECtang command has improved
considerably since its debut. New options let you specify a rotation angle
and — very handy for space planners — you can now provide one dimension
and an area. RECtang will calculate the length of the other side and draw the
rectangle.
Choose your sides with polygon
Rectangles and other closed polylines are types of polygons, or closed figures
with three or more sides. The AutoCAD POLygon command provides a quick
way of drawing regular polygons — polygons in which all sides and angles are
equal. (If regular polygons seem a little square, maybe that’s because a square
is a special case of a regular polygon!)
The following procedure demonstrates the POLygon command:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the polygon that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Polygon button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the POLygon command and prompts you to enter the
number of sides for the polygon:
Enter number of sides <4>:
3. Type the number of sides for the polygon that you want to draw and
press Enter.
The command line prompts you to specify the center point of the 
polygon:
Specify center of polygon or [Edge]:
You can use the Edge option to draw a polygon by specifying one side,
instead of the center and radius of an imaginary inscribed or circum-
scribed circle. The imaginary circle method is much more common.
4. Specify the center point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The command line prompts you to specify whether the polygon will be
inscribed in or circumscribed about an imaginary circle whose radius
you will specify in the following step:
143
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

Enter an option [Inscribed in circle/Circumscribed about
circle] <I>:
5. Type I or C and press Enter.
The command line prompts you to specify the radius of imaginary circle:
Specify radius of circle:
6. Specify the radius by typing a distance or clicking a point.
AutoCAD draws the polygon.
If you type a distance or you click a point with Ortho turned on, the
polygon will be aligned orthogonally, as shown in Figure 6-5. If you click
a point with Ortho turned off, the polygon most likely won’t be aligned
orthogonally.
Figure 6-5 shows the results of drawing plenty of polygons — a practice known
as “polygony,” and which, as far as we know, remains legal in most states.
Rectangles and polygons in AutoCAD are really just polylines that you specify
in a way that’s appropriate to the shape you’re creating. You’ll notice this when
you grip edit a rectangle or polygon and move one of the vertexes: Only the
selected vertex moves. AutoCAD doesn’t make the entire rectangle or polygon
larger or smaller. (See Chapter 7 for information about grip editing.)

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

(Throwing) Curves
Although straight-line segments predominate in many CAD drawings, even
the most humdrum, rectilinear design is likely to have a few curves. And if
you’re drawing car bodies or Gaudí buildings, your drawings will be almost
nothing but curves! This section shows you how to use the following
AutoCAD curve-drawing commands:
 Circle: Draws circles (you were expecting rectangles, maybe?)
 Arc: Draws circular arcs — arcs cut from circles, not from ellipses,
parabolas, or some other complicated curve
 ELlipse: Draws ellipses and elliptical arcs
 SPLine: Draws smoothly flowing curves of a variety of shapes
 DOnut: Draws filled-in annular rings and circles
 REVCLOUD: Draws free-form “clouds,” the most common application of
which is to indicate revised areas in the drawing
The following sections describe each command.
Going full circle
AutoCAD offers an easy way to draw circles, and it also offers . . . other ways.
The easy way is to define the center point of the circle and then to define the
radius or diameter. You can also define a circle by entering one of the follow-
ing options of the command (for those “other” ways):
 3P (3-Point): Specify any three points on the circumference.
 2P (2-Point): Specify the endpoints of a diameter of the circle.
 Ttr (Tangent-Tangent-Radius): Specify two lines or other objects that
are tangent to the circle, and then specify its radius.
Whether these additional circle-drawing methods are useful or superfluous
depends on the kinds of drawings that you make and how geometry is defined
in your industry. Get familiar with the default center point/radius method and
then try the other methods to see whether they may be helpful to you. If you
find yourself going around in circles, you can always draw them the default
way and move them into position with other geometry.
145
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the circle that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Circle button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the Circle command and prompts you to specify the
center point of the circle. Press the down arrow on your keyboard to see
the options at the dynamic cursor. The command line shows:
Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan
radius)]:
The prompts show the methods other than “center point plus radius”
that you can use to draw circles in AutoCAD. (No, “tan tan radius” is not
a mathematician’s dance.) Look up “CIRCLE command” in the online
help if you think you may have a use for these less common circle-draw-
ing methods.
3. Specify the center point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
Use one of the precision techniques described in Chapter 5 if you’re
doing real drafting. Object snap, snap, and typing coordinates all work
well for specifying the center point.
AutoCAD then prompts you to specify the circle’s radius:
Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]:
Type D and press Enter if you prefer to enter the diameter rather than the
radius and you’ve forgotten your twos tables — or, more seriously, if the
diameter is easier to specify with the cursor or to type exactly than
the radius is.
4. Specify the radius by typing a distance or clicking a point.
AutoCAD draws the circle, as shown in Figure 6-6.

Arc-y-ology
Arcs in AutoCAD are, quite simply, pieces of circles. As with circles, AutoCAD
offers you an easy way to define arcs. Just specify three points on-screen to
define the arc, easy as one-two-three. These points tell AutoCAD where to
start the arc, how much to curve it, and where to end it.
Sounds pretty easy, right? So where’s the problem? The trouble is that you
often must specify arcs more exactly than is possible by using this method.
AutoCAD helps you specify such arcs, too, but the procedure ain’t easy.
You can start your arc by specifying the center of the arc or the start point.
If you choose the Center option, AutoCAD prompts you for the center point
first and the start point second. AutoCAD defines arcs counterclockwise, so
pick a start point in a clockwise direction from the end point. After you spec-
ify the center and start point, AutoCAD presents several options you can
choose, including the following:
 Angle: This option specifies the included angle that the arc sweeps out.
A 180-degree angle, for example, is a semicircle.
 Length of chord: This option specifies the length of an imaginary straight
line connecting the endpoints of the arc. Most people use this option
seldom or never.
 Endpoint: This option specifies where the arc ends. It’s the default option
and is often the easiest to use.
If you specify the start point as the first option, you can choose among the
following three command line options as well:
 Center: This option prompts you for the arc’s center point and then fin-
ishes with the three options listed above.
 End: This option specifies the endpoint of the arc. You then need to
define the angle the arc covers, its direction, its radius, or its center
point.
 Second point: This is the default option. The second point you choose is
not the endpoint; instead, it’s a point on the arc that, along with the start
and endpoints, defines how much the arc curves. After you enter the
second point, you must enter an endpoint to complete the arc.
To get a feel for how these permutations can be strung together to create dif-
ferent arc-drawing methods, choose Draw➪Arc and look at the impressive
submenu that unfurls, as shown in Figure 6-7.
147
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

The following example shows how you draw an arc with the default start
point/second point/endpoint method:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the arc that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Arc button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the Arc command and prompts you to specify the first
endpoint of the arc. The command line shows:
Specify start point of arc or [Center]:
3. Specify the start point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify a second point on the arc:
Specify second point of arc or [Center/End]:
4. Specify a second point on the arc by clicking a point or typing 
coordinates.
The second point lies somewhere along the curve of the arc. AutoCAD
determines the exact curvature of the arc after you choose the final end-
point in the following step. To align the second point with an existing
object, use an object snap mode.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

AutoCAD prompts you to specify the other endpoint of the arc; as you
move the cursor around, AutoCAD shows how the arc will look:
Specify end point of arc:
5. Specify the other endpoint of the arc by clicking a point or typing
coordinates.
AutoCAD draws the arc, as shown in Figure 6-7.
Ellipses (S. Grant?)
An ellipse is like a warped circle with a major (long) axis and a minor (short)
axis. These axes determine the ellipse’s length, width, and degree of curva-
ture. An elliptical arc is an arc cut from an ellipse. Some kinds of drawing
geometry require ellipses or elliptical arcs, but many people use AutoCAD
happily for years without ever drawing an ellipse. If you think you’re one of
those people, skip this section.
The AutoCAD ELlipse command provides a straightforward way of drawing
an ellipse: You specify the two endpoints of one of its axes and then specify
an endpoint on the other axis. But like the Arc command, the ELlipse com-
mand offers a bunch of other options:
 Arc: This option generates an elliptical arc, not a full ellipse. You define
an elliptical arc just as you do a full ellipse. The following methods for
creating an ellipse apply to either.
 Center: This option requires that you define the center of the ellipse and
then the endpoint of an axis. You can then either enter the distance of
the other axis or specify that a rotation around the major axis define the
ellipse. If you choose the latter, you can enter (or drag the ellipse to) a
specific rotation for the second axis that, in turn, completely defines the
ellipse.
 Rotation: With this option, you specify an angle, which defines the cur-
vature of the ellipse — small angles make fat ellipses (0 degrees creates
a circle, in fact), and large angles make skinny ellipses. The name of the
option, Rotation, has something to do with rotating an imaginary circle
around the first axis. If you can figure out the imaginary circle business,
then you have a better imagination than we do.
The following command line example creates an ellipse by using the default
endpoints of the axes method. Figure 6-8 shows an ellipse and an elliptical arc.
149
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

Command: ELlipse
Specify axis endpoint of ellipse or [Arc/Center]: pick or
type the first endpoint of one axis
Specify other endpoint of axis: pick or type the other
endpoint of one axis
Specify distance to other axis or [Rotation]: pick or type
the endpoint of the other axis
You can create elliptical arcs (as opposed to the circular arcs that the
AutoCAD Arc command draws) by using the Arc option of the ELlipse com-
mand; it’s perfect for drawing those cannonball trajectories! Alternatively,
you can draw a full ellipse and use the TRIM or BREAK command to cut a
piece out of it.
Splines: The sketchy, sinuous curves
Most people use CAD programs for precision drawing tasks: straight lines,
carefully defined curves, precisely specified points, and so on. AutoCAD
is not the program to free your inner artist — unless your inner artist is
Mondrian. Nonetheless, even meticulously created CAD drawings sometimes
need free-form curves. The AutoCAD spline object is just the thing for the job.
Although PLine is pronounced to rhyme with “beeline,” SPLine rhymes with
“vine.” (If you liked my earlier pronunciation comment, you may want to think
about beer before you say “PLine” and about wine before you say “SPLine.”)
Figure 6-8:

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

You can use AutoCAD splines in two ways:
 Eyeball the location and shape of the curve and don’t worry too much
about getting it just so. That’s the free-form, sketchy, not-too-precise
approach that we describe here.
 Specify their control points and curvature characteristics precisely.
Beneath their easygoing, informal exterior, AutoCAD splines are really
highly precise, mathematically defined entities called NURBS curves
(Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline curves). Mathematicians and some
mechanical and industrial designers care a lot about the precise charac-
teristics of the curves they work with. For those people, the AutoCAD
SPLine and SPlinEdit commands include a number of advanced options.
Look up “spline curves” in the AutoCAD online help if you need preci-
sion in your splines.
Drawing splines is straightforward, if you ignore the advanced options. The
following procedure draws a free-form curve with the SPLine command:
1. Set object properties to the layer and other properties that you want
applied to the spline that you’ll draw.
2. Click the Spline button on the Draw toolbar.
AutoCAD starts the SPLine command and prompts you to specify the
first endpoint of the spline. The command line shows:
Specify first point or [Object]:
3. Specify the start point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify additional points:
Specify next point:
4. Specify additional points by clicking or typing coordinates.
After you pick the second point, press the down-arrow key to display
additional options at the dynamic cursor. The command line shows:
Specify next point or [Close/Fit tolerance] <start tan-
gent>:
Because you’re drawing a free-form curve, you usually don’t need to use
object snaps or other precision techniques when picking spline points.
5. Press Enter after you’ve chosen the final endpoint of your spline.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify tangent lines for each end of the spline:
Specify start tangent:
Specify end tangent:
The Specify start tangent and Specify end tangent prompts can
control the curvature of the start and end points of the spline. In most
cases, just pressing Enter at both prompts to accept the default tangents
works fine.
151
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

6. Press Enter twice to accept the default tangent directions.
AutoCAD draws the spline.
Figure 6-9 shows some examples of splines.
After you’ve drawn a spline, you can grip edit it to adjust its shape. See
Chapter 7 for information about grip editing. If you need finer control over
spline editing, look up the SPlinEdit command in the AutoCAD online help.
Donuts: The circles with a difference
Creating a donut is a simple way to define a single object that consists of two
concentric circles with the space between them filled.
When you start the DOnut command, AutoCAD prompts you for the inside
diameter and the outside diameter — the size of the hole and the size of the
donut, as measured across their widest points. After you’ve entered these
values, AutoCAD prompts you for the center point of the donut. But one
donut is rarely enough, so AutoCAD keeps prompting you for additional
center points until you press Enter (the AutoCAD equivalent of saying, “no,
really, I’m full now!”).
The following example draws a regulation-size donut, with a 1.5-inch hole and
3.5-inch outside diameter. Figure 6-10 shows two kinds of donuts.
Figure 6-9:
A slew of
splines.
152
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Command: DOnut
Specify inside diameter of donut <0.5000>: 1.5
Specify outside diameter of donut <1.0000>: 3.5
Specify center of donut or <exit>: pick or type the center
point of one or more donuts
Specify center of donut or <exit>: 
You can use the DOnut command to create a filled circle — also known as a
jelly-filled donut. Just specify an inside diameter of 0.
Revision clouds on the horizon
It’s customary in many industries to submit a set of drawings at a stage of
completion and then submit them again later with revisions — corrections,
clarifications, and requested changes. Often, the recipients like to locate
changed stuff easily. A common drafting convention in many industries is
to call attention to revised items by drawing free-form clouds around them.
The REVCLOUD command makes quick work of drawing such clouds.
Drawing revision clouds is easy, after you understand that you click with the
mouse only once in the drawing area. That one click defines the starting
point for the cloud’s perimeter. After that, you simply move the cursor
around, and the cloud takes shape. When you return to near the point that
you clicked in the beginning, AutoCAD automatically closes the cloud.
Figure 6-10:
Donuts,
plain and
jelly-filled.
153
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

The following command line example shows you how to draw a revision
cloud. Figure 6-11 shows what revision clouds look like.
Command: REVCLOUD
Minimum arc length: 0.5000  Maximum arc length: 0.5000
Style: Normal
Specify start point or [Arc length/Object/Style] <Object>:
pick a point along the perimeter of your future
cloud
Guide crosshairs along cloud path... sweep the cursor around
to define the cloud’s perimeter
You don’t need to click again. Simply move the cursor around without click-
ing. AutoCAD draws the next lobe of the cloud when your cursor reaches the
Minimum arc length distance from the end of the previous lobe.
Continue moving the cursor around until you return to the point where you
clicked first.
Revision cloud finished.
Here are a few tips for using revision clouds:
 It’s a good idea to put revision clouds on their own layer so that you can
choose to plot with or without the clouds visible.
 You’ll probably find it easier to control the shape of revision clouds if
you turn off ortho mode before you start the command.
Figure 6-11:
Cloud cover.
154
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 You may need to add a triangle and number, as shown in Figure 6-11, to
indicate the revision number. A block with an attribute is a good way to
handle this requirement: Chapter 13 covers blocks and attributes.
If the revision cloud’s lobes are too small or too large, erase the cloud, restart
the REVCLOUD command, and use the command’s Arc length option to
change the minimum and maximum arc lengths. The default minimum and
maximum lengths are 0.5 (or 15 in metric drawings) multiplied by the DIM-
SCALE (DIMension SCALE) system variable setting. If you make the minimum
and maximum lengths equal (which is the default), the lobes will be approxi-
mately equal in size. If you make them unequal, there will be more variation
in lobe size — you’ll get “fluffier” clouds. Fortunately, all of these options are
more than most nonmeteorologists will need. If you’ve set DIMSCALE prop-
erly during your drawing setup procedure (see Chapter 4), REVCLOUD
should do a pretty good job of guessing reasonable default arc lengths.
Scoring Points
We thought about not covering points in this book, but we didn’t want you
complaining that AutoCAD 2006 For Dummies is pointless.
The word point describes two different things in AutoCAD:
 A location in the drawing that you specify (by typing coordinates or
clicking with the mouse)
 An object that you draw with the POint command
Throughout this chapter and most of the book, we tell you to specify points —
that’s the location meaning. This section tells you how to draw point objects.
A point object in AutoCAD can serve two purposes.
 Points often identify specific locations in your drawing to other people
who look at the drawing. A point can be something that displays on the
screen, either as a tiny dot or as another symbol, such as a cross with a
circle around it.
 You can use points as precise object snap locations. Think of them as
construction points. For example, when you’re laying out a new building,
you might draw point objects at some of the engineering survey points
and then snap to those points as you sketch the building’s shape with
the polyline command. You use the NODe object snap mode to snap to
AutoCAD point objects. In this guise, points usually are for your use in
drawing and editing precisely. Other people who view the drawing prob-
ably won’t even be aware that the point objects are there.
155
Chapter 6: Where to Draw the Line

What makes AutoCAD point objects complicated is their almost limitless
range of display options, provided to accommodate the two different kinds of
purposes just described (and possibly some others that we haven’t figured
out yet). You use the Point Style dialog box, shown in Figure 6-12, to specify
how points should look in the current drawing.
DDPTYPE is the command that opens the Point Style dialog box. You can
access it from the menus by choosing Format➪Point Style. The top portion of
the dialog box shows the available point display styles. Most of the choices
do pretty much the same thing. Just click one of the squares that says “hey,
that’s a point!” to you.
The first choice, a single-pixel dot, is hard to see on the screen, and the
second choice, invisible (a stealth point?), is impossible to see. Avoid these
choices if you want your point objects to show up on the screen and on plots.
The single-pixel dot, which is the default display style, works well if you use
point objects as object snap locations and don’t want the points obtrusive
on plots.
The remaining settings in the Point Style dialog box control the size at which
points appear on the screen at different zoom resolutions. The default settings
often work fine, but if you’re not satisfied with them, click the Help button to
find out how to change them.
Figure 6-12:

Style dialog

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

After you specify the point style, placing points on-screen is easy; the follow-
ing example shows you how.
Command: POint
Current point modes: PDMODE=0 PDSIZE=0.0000
Specify a point:  pick or type the coordinates of a location
in the drawing
PDMODE and PDSIZE in the command prompt are system variables that cor-
respond to the point display mode and display size options in the Point Style
dialog box. If you want to know exactly how the system variables correspond
to the dialog box choices, you have all the makings of a successful CAD nerd.
Click the Help button in the Point Style dialog box to find out more (about the
system variables — not about yourself).
If you start the POint command from the Draw toolbar or the Draw➪Point➪
Multiple Point menu, it will repeat automatically — that is, the command line
will prompt you repeatedly to Specify a point. When you’re finished draw-
ing points, press Esc to finish the command for good. If the command doesn’t
repeat automatically and you want to draw more points, press the Enter key
to repeat the POint command and pick another location on the screen. Repeat
as required: Enter, pick, Enter, pick, Enter pick . . . by now you should’ve
gotten the point.

diting objects is the flip side of creating them, and in AutoCAD, you spend
a lot of time editing — far more than drawing objects from scratch. That’s
partly because the design and drafting process is by its nature iterative, and
also because CAD programs make it easy to edit objects cleanly.
When you edit objects in AutoCAD, you need to be just as concerned about
specifying precise locations and distances as you are when you originally
create the objects. Make sure that you’re familiar with the precision tech-
niques described in Chapter 5 before you apply the editing techniques from
this chapter to real drawings.
Commanding and Selecting
AutoCAD offers two main styles of editing:
 Command-first editing
 Selection-first editing
Within the selection-first editing style, you have an additional choice of edit-
ing that uses actual, named commands and direct manipulation of objects
without named commands. The following sections cover these editing styles.

Command-first editing
With command-first editing, you enter a command and then click the objects
on which the command works. This style of editing may seem backwards to
you at first unless you’re a longtime user of AutoCAD. Command-first editing
works well for power users who are in a hurry and who are willing to memo-
rize most of the commands they need to do their work. It’s no surprise that
command-first editing is the default style of editing in AutoCAD.
Selection-first editing
In selection-first editing, you perform the same steps — in the same order —
as in most Windows applications: Select the object first, and then choose the
command.
Selection-first editing tends to be easier to master and makes AutoCAD more
approachable for new and occasional users.
Direct manipulation is a refinement of selection-first editing in which you per-
form common editing operations by using the mouse to grab the selected
object and perform an action on it, such as moving all or part of it to a differ-
ent place in the drawing. No named command is involved; the act of moving
the mouse and clicking the mouse buttons in certain ways causes the editing
changes to happen. AutoCAD supports direct manipulation through a power-
ful but somewhat complicated technique called grip editing. Grips are the
little square handles that appear on an object when you select it. You can use
the grips to stretch, move, copy, rotate, or otherwise edit the object. These
grip-editing techniques can make selection-first editing almost as powerful as
command-first editing. 
Choosing an editing style
This chapter emphasizes command-first editing. (We also discuss grip editing
at the end of the chapter.) AutoCAD is fundamentally a command-first pro-
gram. AutoCAD started out offering only command-first editing and later
added selection-first methods; AutoCAD 2006 inherits this ancestral trait. We
emphasize command-first editing for the following reasons:
 It’s the default AutoCAD editing style.
 It works consistently with all editing commands — some editing com-
mands remain command-first only.
 It provides added object selection flexibility, which is useful when you
work on complicated, busy drawings.
160
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

After you know how to do command-first editing, you can simply reverse the
order of many editing operations to do them selection-first style instead. But if
you don’t get familiar with command-first editing in the beginning, you’ll be
completely bewildered by some very useful AutoCAD commands that work
only in the command-first style, such as TRim and EXtend. (Commands such as
these ignore any already selected objects and prompt you to select objects.)
Much of the information in this chapter assumes that you’re using the default
AutoCAD selection settings. If object selection or grip editing works differ-
ently than we describe in this chapter, check the settings on the Options
dialog box’s Selection tab. Seven check box settings should be turned on (all
other check box settings should be turned off):
 Selection Preview When a Command Is Active
 Selection Preview When No Command Is Active
 Noun/Verb Selection
 Implied Windowing
 Object Grouping
 Enable Grips
 Enable Grip Tips
For information on what these options do, click the small question mark
button beside the Close button at the top-right corner of the Options dialog
box, and then click one of the options.
Grab It
Part of AutoCAD’s editing flexibility comes from its object selection flexibility.
For example, command-first editing offers 16 selection modes! (We describe
the most useful ones in this chapter.) Don’t worry though; you can get by
most of the time with three selection modes:
 Selecting a single object
 Enclosing objects in a window (pick left corner, and then right corner)
 Including part or all objects in a crossing window (pick right corner, and
then left corner)
One-by-one selection
The most obvious way to select objects is to pick (by clicking) them one at a
time. You can build up a selection set cumulatively with this “pick one object
161
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

at a time” selection mode. This cumulative convention may be different from
what you’re used to. In most Windows programs, if you select one object and
then another, the first object is deselected, and the second one selected. Only
the object you select last remains selected. In AutoCAD, all the objects you
select, one at a time, remain selected and are added to the set, no matter how
many objects you pick. (You can change this behavior to make AutoCAD work
like Windows does by turning on the Use Shift to Add to Selection option on
the Option dialog box’s Selection tab, but we suggest you not change it.) Most
editing commands affect the entire group of selected objects.
Selection boxes left and right
Selecting objects one at a time works great when you want to edit a small
number of objects, but many CAD editing tasks involve editing lots of objects.
Do you really want to pick 132 lines, arcs, and circles, one at a time?
Like most Windows graphics programs, AutoCAD provides a selection window
feature for grabbing a bunch of objects in a rectangular area. As you may guess
by now, the AutoCAD version of this feature is a bit more powerful than the
analogous feature in other Windows graphics programs and, therefore, slightly
confusing at first. AutoCAD calls its version implied windowing.
If you click a blank area of the drawing — that is, not on an object — you’re
implying to AutoCAD that you want to specify a selection window, or box. If
you move the cursor to the right before picking the other corner of the selec-
tion box, you’re further implying that you want to select all objects that
reside completely within the selection box. If you move the cursor to the left
before picking the other corner of the selection box, you’re implying that you
want to select all objects that reside completely or partially within the selec-
tion box.
The AutoCAD terminology for these two kinds of selection boxes gets a little
confusing:
 The move-to-the-right, only-select-objects-completely-within-the-box
mode is called window object selection.
 The move-to-the-left, select-objects-completely-or-partially-within-the-
box mode is called crossing object selection.
162
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Fortunately, AutoCAD gives you visual cues that there’s a difference. As you
move to the right, the window box appears as a solid rectangle. As you move
to the left, the crossing box appears as a ghosted, or dashed, rectangle.
In addition to the solid box and dashed box indicators, AutoCAD 2006 also
shades the area within the selection boxes: blue for a window box, and green
for a crossing box.
Figures 7-1 and 7-2 show a window box and a crossing box, respectively, in
action.

You can mix and match selecting individual objects, specifying a window box,
and specifying a crossing box. Each selection adds to the current selection
set, allowing you to build up an enormously complicated selection of objects
and then operate on them with one or more editing commands.
You can press the Shift key in combination with any of the three standard
selection modes — single object, window box, and crossing box — to remove
already selected objects from the selection set. This feature is especially
useful when you’re building a selection set in a crowded drawing; you can
select a big batch of objects by using Window or Crossing, and then hold
down the Shift key while selecting to remove the objects that you want to
exclude from the editing operation.
Perfecting Selecting
When you edit in command-first mode, you have all the selection options
described in the previous section — single object, window box, and crossing

box — plus a slew of others. If you type ? and press Enter at any Select
objects prompt, AutoCAD lists all the selection options at the command line:
Window/Last/Crossing/BOX/ALL/Fence/WPolygon/CPolygon/Group/
Add/Remove/Multiple/Previous/Undo/AUto/Single
Pressing ? at a Select objects prompt has no impact on the dynamic
cursor display. You can see the options if you press the F2 key, but that takes
a lot more screen space than the command line window. If your command
line area is not visible, type COMMANDLINE and press Enter, or use the
Ctrl+9 key combination to turn it on.

prompt, type the uppercase letters corresponding to the option and press

tell AutoCAD that you’ve finished selecting objects and want to start the edit-
ing operation.
Two new object selection features in AutoCAD 2006 remove any doubt about
which objects you’re selecting. Rollover highlighting displays individual objects
with a thick dashed lineweight as the cursor is moved over them. Area selec-
tion displays a transparent, colored highlight over multiple selections using
window and crossing options.

Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

The following example demonstrates how to use the Erase command in 
command-first mode with several different selection options. The selection
techniques used in this example apply to most AutoCAD editing commands:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
If any objects are selected when you start an editing command, the com-
mand in most cases will operate on those objects (selection-first editing)
instead of prompting you to select objects (command-first editing). For
the reasons that we describe earlier in this chapter, you should use the
command-first editing style until you’re thoroughly familiar with it.
Later, you can experiment with selection-first editing if you like. (Just
reverse the sequence of commanding and selecting that we describe in
this chapter.)
2. Click the Erase button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD displays the Select objects prompt at the command line
and the dynamic cursor.
3. Select two or three individual objects by clicking each one.
AutoCAD adds each object to the selection set. All the objects you select
remain ghosted. AutoCAD displays the Select objects prompt.
4. Specify a window selection box that completely encloses several
objects.
Move the cursor to a point below and to the left of the objects, click,
release the mouse button, move the cursor above and to the right of the
objects, and click again.
All objects that are completely within the box are selected.
5. Specify a crossing selection box (Crossing) that encloses a few objects
and cuts through several others.
Move the cursor to a point below and to the right of some of the objects,
click, release the mouse button, move the cursor above and to the left of
some of the objects, and click and release again.
All objects that are completely within or cross through the box are
selected.
6. Type WP and press Enter to activate the WPolygon selection option.
AutoCAD prompts you to pick points that define the selection polygon.
7. Pick a series of points and press Enter.
Figure 7-3 shows an example. After you press Enter, AutoCAD selects all
objects that are completely within the polygon.
8. Press Enter to end object selection.
AutoCAD erases all the selected objects.
166
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Notice how you were able to use a combination of object selection methods
to build up a selection set and then press Enter to execute the command 
on the selected objects. Most AutoCAD editing commands work this way in 
command-first mode.
If, after erasing a selection set, you immediately realize that you didn’t really
mean to do away with so many objects, you can use the Undo button on the
Standard toolbar to restore all of them. But AutoCAD has one additional
unerase trick up its sleeve — the aptly named OOPS command. When you
type OOPS and press Enter, AutoCAD restores the last selection set that you
erased — even if you’ve run other commands after Erase.

The following sections cover the most important AutoCAD editing com-
mands, using command-first editing mode.

Whether you start an AutoCAD editing command by clicking a toolbar
button, choosing a pull-down menu command, or typing a command name,
in almost all cases, the command prompts you for points, distances, and
options at the command line. Read the prompts during every step of the com-
mand, especially when you’re figuring out how to use a new editing com-
mand. Otherwise, you’re unlikely to complete the command successfully.
AutoCAD 2006’s dynamic input system displays command options at the
cursor. When you see a cursor tooltip with an up/down arrow icon, press the
down-arrow key on the keyboard to display the command options in a menu.
You then can use the mouse to select an option (see Figure 7-4). Pressing the
up-arrow key displays previous input.
As we describe in Chapter 5, maintaining precision when you draw and edit is
crucial to good CAD work. If you’ve used a drawing program and are accus-
tomed to moving, stretching, and otherwise editing objects by eye, you’ll
need to suppress that habit when you edit in AutoCAD. Nothing ruins a draw-
ing faster than approximate editing, in which you shove objects around until
they look okay, without worrying about precise distances and points.
The big three: Move, Copy, and Stretch
Moving, copying, and stretching are, for many drafters, the three most
common editing operations. AutoCAD obliges this need with the Move, CoPy,
and Stretch commands.
169
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

Base points and displacements
The Move, CoPy, and Stretch commands all require that you specify how far
and in what direction you want the objects moved, copied, or stretched. After
you’ve selected the objects to be edited and started the command, AutoCAD
prompts you for two pieces of information:
Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:
Specify second point of displacement or <use first point as
displacement>:
In a not-so-clear way, these prompts say that two possible methods exist for
you to specify how far and in what direction you want the objects copied,
moved, or stretched:
 The most common way is to pick or type the coordinates of two points
that define a displacement vector. AutoCAD calls these points the base
point and the second point (hence, it’s called the “base point method”).
Imagine an arrow pointing from the base point to the second point —
that arrow defines how far and in what direction the objects get copied,
moved, or stretched.
 The other way is to type an X,Y pair of numbers that represents a dis-
tance rather than a point. This distance is the absolute displacement
that you want to copy, move, or stretch the objects (thus it’s called the
“displacement method”).
Figure 7-4:

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

How does AutoCAD know whether your response to the first prompt is a base
point or a displacement? It depends on how you respond to the second prompt.
(Is that confusing, or what?) First, you pick a point on-screen or enter coordi-
nates at the Base point prompt. Next, there are a couple of possibilities:
 If you then pick or type the coordinates of a point at the second point
prompt, AutoCAD says to itself, “Aha — displacement vector!” and
moves the objects according to the imaginary arrow pointing from the
base point to the second point.
 If you press Enter at the second prompt (without having typed any-
thing), AutoCAD says, “Aha — displacement distance,” and uses the X,Y
pair of numbers that you typed at the first prompt as an absolute dis-
placement distance.
What makes this displacement business even more confusing is that AutoCAD
lets you pick a point at the first prompt and press Enter at the second prompt.
AutoCAD still says, “Aha — displacement distance,” but now it treats the coor-
dinates of the point you picked as an absolute distance. If the point you picked
has relatively large coordinates, the objects can get moved way outside the
normal drawing area as defined by the limits. The objects fly off into space,
which you probably won’t notice at first because you’re zoomed into part of
your normal drawing area; it just looks to you like the objects have vanished!
In short, be careful when you press Enter during the Move, CoPy, and Stretch
commands. Press Enter in response to the second prompt only if you want
AutoCAD to use your response to the first prompt as an absolute displacement.
If you make a mistake, click the Undo button to back up and try again. You can
use Zoom Extents (described in Chapter 8) to look for objects that have flown
off into space.
When you use the displacement option of the Move, CoPy, or Stretch com-
mand, AutoCAD remembers the displacement distance that you specify and
offers it as the default the next time you use the same command with the dis-
placement option.
Move
The following steps demonstrate command-first editing with the Move com-
mand, using the base point method of indicating how far and in what direc-
tion to move the selected objects. This procedure also gives detailed
recommendations on how to use precision techniques when you edit:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
2. Click the Move button on the Modify toolbar.
The command line displays the Select objects prompt.
3. Select one or more objects.
You can use any of the object selection techniques described in the
“Perfecting Selecting” section, earlier in this chapter.
171
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

4. Press Enter when you’re finished selecting objects.
AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify base point or displacement:
5. Specify a base point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
This point serves as the tail end of your imaginary arrow indicating how
far and in what direction you want the objects moved. After you pick a
base point, it’s fairly easy to see what’s going on because AutoCAD dis-
plays a temporary image of the object that moves around as you move
the cursor. Figure 7-5 shows what the screen looks like.
Specify a base point somewhere on or near the object(s) that you’re
moving. You can use an object snap mode to choose a point exactly on
one of the objects.
AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify second point of displacement or <use first point
as displacement>:
6. Specify the second point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The second point serves as the arrow end of your imaginary displace-
ment arrow. After you specify the second point, AutoCAD moves the
objects.
Don’t press Enter alone at this prompt! If you do, AutoCAD treats the X,Y
coordinates of the first point you picked as an absolute displacement,
and the objects fly off in an unpredictable fashion.
These are common precision techniques for specifying the second point:
 Use an object snap mode to pick a second point exactly on another
object in the drawing.
 Type a relative or polar coordinate, as described in Chapter 5. For exam-
ple, if you type @6,2, AutoCAD moves the objects 6 units to the right and
2 units up. If you type @3<45, AutoCAD moves the objects 3 units at an
angle of 45 degrees.
Use direct distance entry to move objects in an orthogonal or polar tracking
direction. See Chapter 5 for instructions.
Copy
The CoPy command works almost identically to the Move command, except
that AutoCAD leaves the selected objects in place and moves new copies of
them to the new location. The CoPy command creates multiple copies by
default. If you want only one copy, press Enter after placing it in the drawing. 
The CoPy command includes an Undo option with which you can roll back
multiple copies within a single Copy operation.
172
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

Copy between drawings
You can’t copy objects from one drawing to another with the CoPy command.
Instead, you use the COPYCLIP command, together with its companion com-
mand, PASTECLIP. 
COPYCLIP and PASTECLIP use the Windows clipboard to store temporarily
drawing objects from one file so they can be pasted into another file. The
Standard toolbar contains Cut, Copy, and Paste tools, the three standard clip-
board buttons you find in every Windows program.
It’s easy to confuse the CoPy and COPYCLIP commands:
 CoPy is AutoCAD’s primary command for copying objects within a 
drawing.
 COPYCLIP — along with related commands like CUTCLIP and 
PASTECLIP — is AutoCAD’s version of copy and paste via the Windows
Clipboard.
(You can use the Windows Clipboard cut-and-paste method to copy or move
objects within a single drawing, but using the AutoCAD CoPy and Move com-
mands usually gives you better control and precision.)

Stretch
The Stretch command is superficially similar to CoPy and Move; it has the
same inscrutable base point and displacement prompts, and it shifts objects —
or parts of objects — to other locations in the drawing. But it also has impor-
tant differences that often confound new AutoCAD users to the point where
they give up trying to figure out how to use Stretch. That’s a mistake because
Stretch is a valuable command. With it, you can perform editing operations in
seconds that would take many minutes with other commands. Here are the
things you need to know to make Stretch your friend:
 To use Stretch, you must select objects by using a crossing selection box
(or crossing polygon), as described in the section, “Perfecting Selecting,”
earlier in this chapter. See Figure 7-6.
 Stretch operates on the defining points of objects — endpoints of a line,
vertices of a polyline, the center of a circle, and so on — according to
the following rule: If a defining point is within the crossing selection box
that you specify, AutoCAD moves the defining point and updates the
object accordingly.
For example, if your crossing selection box surrounds one endpoint of
a line but not the other endpoint, Stretch moves the first endpoint and
redraws the line in the new position dictated by the first endpoint’s new
location. It’s as though you have a rubber band tacked to the wall with
two pins, and you move one of the pins. 
 Stretch can make lines longer or shorter, depending on your crossing
selection box and displacement vector. In other words, the Stretch com-
mand really combines stretching and compressing.
174
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 You usually want to turn on ortho or polar tracking mode before stretch-
ing. Otherwise, you’ll end up stretching objects in strange directions, as
shown in Figure 7-7.
The following steps describe how to Stretch lines:
1. Draw some lines in an arrangement similar to the dark lines shown in
Figure 7-8.
Start your stretching with simple objects. You can work up to more com-
plicated objects — polylines, circles, arcs, and so on — after you’ve lim-
bered up with lines.

The command line displays the Select objects prompt, with a warn-
ing to use the Crossing or CPolygon object selection mode:

4. Specify a crossing selection box that encloses some, but not all, end-
points of the lines.
Figure 7-8 shows a sample crossing selection box that completely encloses
the two vertical lines on the right side of the figure. This crossing selec-
tion box cuts through the four horizontal lines, enclosing only one end-
point of each.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

You specify a crossing selection box by picking a point, moving your
mouse to the left, and picking a second point.
5. Press Enter to end object selection.
AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:
6. Specify a base point by object snapping to a point on an existing object
or by typing absolute X,Y coordinates.
This step is just like Step 5 in the Move procedure earlier in this chapter.
AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>:
7. Toggle ortho mode on and then off by clicking the ORTHO button on
the status bar; try moving the cursor around first with ortho mode on
and then with it off to see the difference.
Figure 7-8 shows what the screen looks like as you move the cursor
around with ortho off.
8. Toggle ortho mode on and then specify the second point — usually by
using direct distance entry, object snapping to a point on an existing
object, or typing relative X,Y coordinates.
This step is just like Step 6 in the Move procedure earlier in this chapter.
After you pick the second point, AutoCAD stretches the objects. Notice
that the Stretch command moved the two vertical lines because the
crossing selection box contained both endpoints of both lines. Stretch
lengthened or shortened the four horizontal lines because the crossing
selection box enclosed only one endpoint of each.
In AutoCAD 2006, you can select multiple objects for stretching. You still
must use a crossing or crossing-polygon selection mode, but you can make
multiple selections for the same Stretch operation.
The Stretch command takes some practice, but it’s worth the effort. Draw
some additional kinds of objects and practice stretching with different cross-
ing selection box locations as well as different base points and second points.
More manipulations
The commands in this section — ROtate, SCale, ARray, and Offset — provide
other ways (in addition to Move, CoPy, and Stretch) of manipulating objects
or creating new versions of them. The procedures for each command assume
that you’re familiar with the object selection and editing precision techniques
presented in the Move, CoPy, and Stretch procedures (see the previous sec-
tions in this chapter).
177
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

Rotate
The ROtate command “swings” one or more objects around a point that you
specify. Follow these steps to use the ROtate command:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
2. Click the Rotate button on the Modify toolbar.
3. Select one or more objects and then press Enter to end object selection.
AutoCAD prompts you for the base point for rotating the selected objects:
Specify base point:
4. Specify a base point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
The base point becomes the point about which AutoCAD rotates the
objects. You also have to specify a rotation angle:
Specify rotation angle or [Copy/Reference]: <0>
5. Specify a rotation angle by typing an angle measurement and pressing
Enter, or just press Enter to accept the default value shown in angle
brackets.
Alternatively, you can indicate an angle on the screen by moving the
cursor until the Coordinates section of the status bar indicates the
desired angle and then clicking. If you choose this alternative, you will
need to use ortho mode or polar tracking to indicate a precise angle (for
example, 90 or 45 degrees) or an object snap to rotate an object so that
it aligns precisely with other objects.
After you specify the rotation angle by typing or picking, AutoCAD rotates
the objects into their new position.
By default, the ROtate command rotates (duh!) the selected objects to a new
rotation angle. In AutoCAD 2006, the ROtate command’s copy option makes a
rotated copy while leaving the source object in place.
Scale
If you read all our harping on drawing scales and drawing scale factors in
Chapter 4, you may think that the SCale command performs some magical
scale transformation on your entire drawing. No such luck. It merely scales
one or more objects up or down by a factor that you specify. Here’s how it
works:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
2. Click the Scale button on the Modify toolbar.
3. Select one or more objects and then press Enter to end object selection.
178
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

AutoCAD prompts you for the base point about which it will scale all the
selected objects:
Specify base point:
AutoCAD does not scale each object individually around its own base
point (because most AutoCAD drawing objects don’t have individual
base points). Instead, AutoCAD uses the base point that you specify to
determine how to scale all objects in the selection set. For example, if
you select a circle to scale, pick a point outside the circle as the base
point, and then specify a scale factor of 2, AutoCAD not only makes the
circle twice as big, but also moves the circle twice as far away from the
base point that you specified.
4. Specify a base point by picking a point or typing coordinates.
The base point becomes the point about which the objects are scaled.
AutoCAD prompts you for the scale factor:
Specify scale factor or [Copy/Reference] <1.0000>:
5. Type a scale factor and press Enter.
AutoCAD then scales the objects by the factor that you type, using the
base point that you specified. Numbers greater than one increase the
objects’ size. Numbers smaller than one decrease the objects’ size.
Just like the ROtate command, the SCale command also has a copy option
with which you can make enlarged or reduced duplicates of selected objects
without altering the source objects. And both the SCale and ROtate com-
mands remember the last scale factor or rotation angle entered throughout
the drawing session.
Changing the drawing scale factor of a drawing after you’ve drawn it is a
tedious and complicated process in AutoCAD. In brief, you need to change
the scale-dependent system variables described in Chapter 4, and then scale
some, but not all, drawing objects. You don’t scale the real-world geometry that
you’ve drawn, because its measurements in the real world remain the same.
You do scale objects such as text and hatching that have a fixed height or spac-
ing regardless of drawing scale factor. (The SCALETEXT command can help
with this operation; see Chapter 9 for more information.) Because of these com-
plications, try to make sure that you choose a proper scale and set up the draw-
ing properly for that scale before you begin drawing. See Chapter 4 for details.
Array
The ARray command is like a supercharged CoPy: You use it to create a rec-
tangular grid of objects at regular X and Y spacings or a polar wheel of objects
at a regular angular spacing. For example, you can use rectangular arrays to
populate an auditorium with chairs or a polar array to draw bicycle spokes.
The following steps describe how to create a rectangular array, which you’ll
probably do more often than creating a polar array:
179
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
2. Click the Array button on the Modify toolbar.
The Array dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-9.
3. Click the Select Objects button, and then select one or more objects.
Press Enter to end object selection and return to the Array dialog box.
4. Make sure that the Rectangular Array radio button is selected.
If rectangular arrays seem too square, choose the cool Polar Array radio
button instead and experiment with the other array option.
5. Fill in the five text boxes: Rows, Columns, Row Offset, Column Offset,
and Angle of Array.
The Rows and Columns numbers include the row and column of the
original objects themselves. In other words, entries of 1 don’t create any
new objects in that direction. The Row Offset and Column Offset mea-
surements are the distances between adjacent rows and columns.
6. Click the Preview button.
AutoCAD shows what the array will look like by using your current set-
tings and displays a dialog box with Accept, Modify, and Cancel buttons.
7. Click the Accept button if you’re satisfied with the array, or the
Modify button if you want to change the array parameters.
Offset
You use Offset to create parallel copies of lines, polylines, circles, arcs, or
splines. Follow these steps to use Offset:

Alternatively, you can indicate an offset distance by picking two points
on the screen. If you choose this method, you normally should use object
snaps to specify a precise distance from one existing object to another.
AutoCAD prompts you to select the object from which you want to
create an offset copy:
Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>:
3. Select a single object, such as a line, polyline, or arc.
Note that you can select only one object at a time with the Offset com-
mand. AutoCAD asks where you want the offset object:
Specify point on side to offset or [Exit/Multiple/Undo]
<Exit>:
4. Point to one side or the other of the object and then click.
It doesn’t matter how far away from the object the cursor is when you
click. You’re simply indicating a direction.
AutoCAD repeats the Select object prompt, in case you want to offset
other objects by the same distance:
Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>:
5. Go back to Step 3 if you want to offset another object, or press Enter if
you’re finished offsetting objects for now.
Figure 7-10 shows the Offset command in progress.
If you want to offset a series of connected lines (for example, a rectangular
house plan outline or one side of a pathway on a map), make sure that you
either draw it as a polyline or convert the individual line and/or arc segments
into a polyline with the PEdit command. If you draw a series of line segments
with the Line command and then try to offset it, you have to pick each seg-
ment and offset it individually. Even worse, the corners usually aren’t finished
off in the way that you’d expect, because AutoCAD doesn’t treat the seg-
ments as connected. You avoid all these problems by offsetting a polyline,
which AutoCAD does treat as a single object. See Chapter 6 for more informa-
tion about the differences between lines and polylines.

Slicing, dicing, and splicing
The commands in this section — TRim, EXtend, BReak, Fillet, CHAmfer, and
Join — are useful for shortening and lengthening objects, for breaking them
in two, and for putting them back together again.
Trim and Extend
TRim and EXtend are the twin commands for making lines, polylines, and
arcs shorter and longer. They’re the yin and yang, the Laurel and Hardy, the
Jack Sprat and his wife of the AutoCAD editing world. The two commands
and their prompts are almost identical, so the following steps cover both. We
show the prompts for the TRim command; the EXtend prompts are similar:
1. Click the Trim or Extend button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you to select cutting edges that will do the trimming
(or, if you chose the EXtend command, boundary edges for extending to):

Current settings: Projection=UCS, Edge=None

Select objects or <select all>:
2. Press Enter to select all drawing objects to act as the knife for trimming
objects or the wall to which objects will be extended, or select individ-
ual objects by picking them. Press Enter to end object selection.
Figure 7-11 shows a cutting edge (for TRim) and a boundary edge (for
EXtend).
AutoCAD prompts you to select objects that you want to trim or extend:

Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

3. Select a single object to trim or extend. Choose the portion of the
object that you want AutoCAD to trim away or the end of the object
that’s closer to the extend-to boundary.
AutoCAD trims or extends the object to one of the objects that you
selected in Step 2. If AutoCAD can’t trim or extend the object — for exam-
ple, if the trimming object and the object to be trimmed are parallel —
the command line displays an error message such as Object does not
intersect an edge.
TRim and EXtend normally allow you to select only one object at a time
for trimming or extending. The one exception is that you can type F and
press Enter to use the Fence object selection mode (refer to Table 7-1).
Fence is useful for trimming or extending a large group of objects in one
fell swoop.
The command line continues to prompt you to select other objects to
trim or extend:
Select object to trim or shift-select to extend or
[Fence/Crossing/Project/Edge/eRase/Undo]:
4. Choose additional objects, or press Enter when you’re finished trim-
ming or extending.
If you accidentally trim or extend the wrong object and you’re still in the
TRim or EXtend command, type U and press Enter to undo the most
recent trim or extend.
The example in Figure 7-11 shows trimming to a single cutting edge, in which
the end of the trimmed lines gets lopped off. Another common use of the
TRim command is for trimming out a piece of a line between two cutting
edges. In the two-cutting-edges scenario, TRim cuts a piece out of the middle
of the trimmed line.
In AutoCAD 2006, the TRim and EXtend commands give you quicker access
to selection options: ALL is the default, which means that everything in the
drawing becomes a cutting edge. Mind you don’t cut yourself! Fence and
Crossing selection options are also accessible from the command line or
dynamic cursor.
The LENgthen command provides other useful ways to make lines, arcs, and
polylines longer (or shorter). You can specify an absolute distance (or “delta”)
to lengthen or shorten by, a percentage to lengthen or shorten by, or a new
total length. Look up “LENGTHEN command” in AutoCAD’s help system for
more information.
Break
The BReak command isn’t what you use before heading out for coffee. It’s for
breaking pieces out of — that is, creating gaps in — lines, polylines, circles,
arcs, or splines. BReak also comes in handy if you need to split one object
into two without actually removing any visible material.
184
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

If you want to create regularly spaced gaps in an object — so that it displays
dashed, for instance — don’t use BReak. Use an AutoCAD dash-dot linetype
instead. See Chapter 5 for more linetype information.
The following example shows how you BReak an object:
1. Click the Break button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you to select a single object that you want to break:
Select object:
2. Select a single object, such as a line, polyline, or arc.
The point you pick when selecting the object serves double duty: It
selects the object, of course, but it also becomes the default first break
point (that is, it defines one side of the gap that you’ll create). Thus, you
should either use one of the AutoCAD precision techniques, such as an
object snap, to pick the object at a precise point, or use the First point
option (described in the next step) to repick the first break point.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the second break point, or to type F
and press Enter if you want to respecify the first break point:
Specify second break point or [First point]:
3. If the point that you picked in the preceding step doesn’t also corre-
spond to a break point (see the previous tip), type F and press Enter to
respecify the first break point, and then pick the point with an object
snap or other precision technique.
If you do type F and press Enter and then respecify the first break point,
AutoCAD prompts you now to select the second break point:
Specify second break point:
4. Specify the second break point by picking a point or typing 
coordinates.
AutoCAD cuts a section out of the object, using the first and second
break points to define the length of the gap.
If you want to cut an object into two pieces without removing anything, click
the Break at Point button on the Modify toolbar. You first select the object
and then choose a second point that defines where AutoCAD breaks the
object in two. You can then move, copy, or otherwise manipulate each sec-
tion of the original object as a separate object.
Fillet and Chamfer
Whereas TRim, EXtend, and BReak alter one object at a time, the Fillet and
CHAmfer commands require a pair of objects. As Figure 7-12 shows, Fillet cre-
ates a curved corner between two lines, whereas CHAmfer creates an angled,
straight corner. (In case you wondered, it’s pronounced “fill-et,” not “fill-eh.”
Saying that you know how to “fill-eh” may get you a job in a butcher shop, but
it will get you strange looks in a design office.)
185
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

The following steps describe how to use the Fillet command. The CHAmfer
command works similarly except that, instead of specifying a fillet distance,
you specify either two chamfer distances or a chamfer length and angle.
1. Click the Fillet button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD displays the current Fillet settings and prompts you to select
the first object for filleting or specify one of three options:
Current settings: Mode = TRIM, Radius = 0.0000
Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/
Multiple]:
2. Type R and press Enter to set the fillet radius.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the fillet radius that it uses for future
fillet operations:
Specify fillet radius <0.0000>:
3. Type a fillet radius and press Enter.
The number you type will be the radius of the arc that joins the two
lines.
Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/
Multiple]:
Figure 7-12:
Cleaning

corners with
Fillet and
CHAmfer.
186
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

4. Select the first line of the pair that you want to fillet.
AutoCAD prompts you to select the second object for filleting:
Select second object or shift-select to apply corner:
5. Select the second line of the pair that you want to fillet.
AutoCAD fillets the two objects, drawing an arc of the radius that you
specified in Step 3.
You can fillet two lines and specify a radius of zero to make them meet at a
point. If you have lots of lines to fillet, whether with a zero or nonzero radius,
use the Fillet command’s Multiple option to speed the process.
Holding down the Shift key before picking the second line automatically gives
you a clean intersection, the same as if you’d explicitly set the fillet radius to
0. The CHAmfer command has the same Shift-select option.
Join
Use the Join command to fill gaps in lines, arcs, elliptical arcs, splines and
polylines. If the lines are collinear, or the arcs, splines, polylines or elliptical
arcs are on a similarly curved path, Join will create a single new entity to
replace the existing separate pieces, as shown in Figure 7-13.
Figure 7-13:
Joining
sundered
pieces.
187
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

The following steps describe how to use the Join command:
1. Click the Join button on the Modify toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you to select the source object: 
Select source object:
2. Select the object whose properties you want the joined line to assume.
AutoCAD prompts according to the object type selected. If you select a
line, the command prompt shows:
Select lines to join to source:
3. Continue selecting collinear lines to join to the original source line.
AutoCAD continues prompting for additional collinear lines until you
press Enter to end object selection. 
Select lines to join to source:
4. Press Enter to end the command.
AutoCAD joins the selected objects into a single object. The new object
will inherit relevant properties of the source object.
Get a Grip
Although command-first editing is the most flexible and widespread editing style
in AutoCAD, it’s not the only way. Grip editing is a useful adjunct to command-
first editing, especially when you want to modify just one or two objects. You
may have encountered grip editing when using other kinds of graphics pro-
grams. Even if you’re an experienced user of other graphics programs, you’ve
never seen grips used in quite the way that AutoCAD uses them.
Anything that you can do with grip editing can be done with command-first
editing as well. In some situations, grip editing is a little more efficient or con-
venient than command-first editing, but command-first editing always gets
the job done. If you master only one style of editing, make it command-first
style. In other words, feel free to skip this section — at least until you’re com-
fortable with command-first editing.
About grips
Grips are little square or triangular handles that appear on an object after
you select it. 
In their simplest guise, AutoCAD grips work similar to the little squares on
graphical objects in other Windows programs. But in AutoCAD, instead of
188
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

clicking and dragging a grip, you must click, release the mouse button, move
the cursor, and click again at the new location. (By separating the selection of
beginning and ending points into two different operations, AutoCAD allows
you to use different techniques — such as different object snap modes — to
select each point.)
AutoCAD grips are, for sophisticated users, better than the grips found in
most other programs, because you can do so much more with them. You
can, for example, use AutoCAD grips to move, stretch, or copy an object. You
also can use them to rotate an object, scale it to a different size, or mirror an
object — that is, create one or more backwards copies. Grips also act as visi-
ble object snaps, or little magnets that attract the cursor.
The grips feature is expanded in AutoCAD 2006. Selecting an arc, for example,
displays both square and triangular grips. Manipulate the square grips to
move midpoints or endpoints to create new arcs with different radii or center
points. Use the triangular grips to lengthen the arc from each end, or increase
the radius without moving the center.
A gripping example
The following sections cover in detail the five grip-editing modes — Stretch,
Move, Rotate, Scale, and Mirror. Follow these steps to explore the grip-editing
modes:
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are
selected.
AutoCAD displays the naked command prompt — that is, no command
is currently active:
Command:
2. Click an object on-screen to select it and display its grips.
Grips — solid blue squares on the selected object — appear at various
points on the object. Note that the AutoCAD command prompt remains
naked; you haven’t started a command or grip-editing operation yet.
3. Click another object.
Both the newly selected object and the object that you selected previ-
ously display grips.
4. Click one of the grips on either object.
The blue square turns to a red square. This grip is now hot, or ready for
a grip-editing operation.
Grip-editing options now appear on the command line. The first option
to appear is STRETCH.
189
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

5. Press the spacebar repeatedly to cycle through the five grip-editing
options on the command line:
** STRETCH **
Specify stretch point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
** MOVE **
Specify move point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
** ROTATE **
Specify rotation angle or [Base
point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit]:
** SCALE **
Specify scale factor or [Base
point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit]:
** MIRROR **
Specify second point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
The grip-editing option displayed on the command line and the dynamic
cursor changes as you press the spacebar. If you move the cursor (with-
out picking) in between each press of the spacebar, the appearance of
your selected object changes as you display each option. As you can
see, each of the grip-editing operations resembles the ordinary AutoCAD
command of the same name. Choosing STRETCH, for example, causes a
stretched version of the object to appear on-screen.
Pressing the spacebar a bunch of times is a good way to become familiar
with the grip-editing modes, but there’s a more direct way to choose a par-
ticular mode. After you click a grip to make it hot, right-click to display the
grip-editing menu. That menu contains all the grip-editing options plus
some other choices, as shown in Figure 7-14.
Pressing the down-arrow key while cycling through the grip-editing
options displays a dynamic cursor menu from which you can choose
options specific to the current grip-editing function.
6. Press the spacebar until STRETCH (or the option you want) reappears
as the grip-editing option.
7. Move the hot grip in the direction in which you want to stretch (or
otherwise manipulate) your object.
AutoCAD dynamically updates the image of the object to show you what
the modified object will look like before you click the final location.
8. Click again to finish the grip-editing operation.
The selected object with the hot grip updates. The object with the cold
grips doesn’t change.
9. Click the same grip that you chose in Step 4 (now in a different loca-
tion) to make it hot.
190
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

10. This time, move the cursor near one of the grips on the other object.
When you feel the magnetic pull of the grip on the other object, click
again to connect the hot grip with the other grip.
The object point represented by the hot grip now coincides exactly with
the grip on the other object.
11. Press Esc to deselect all objects and remove all grips.
Figure 7-15 shows a hot (red) endpoint grip of a line being connected to the
cold (blue) endpoint grip of another line. The ghosted line shows the original
position of the line being edited, and the continuous line shows the new posi-
tion. Using a grip in this way as a visible object snap offers the same advan-
tage as using single point object snaps, as described in Chapter 5: It ensures
precision by making sure that objects meet exactly.
You can experiment with all the grip-editing options to find out how they
affect a selected object.
Because MOVE and STRETCH are the most useful grip-editing modes, we
cover them more specifically.

Move it!
Back in the days of manual drafting, moving objects was a big pain in the
eraser. You had to erase the stuff you wanted to move and redraw the objects
in their new location. In the process, you usually ended up erasing parts of
other stuff that you didn’t want to move and left smudged lines and piles of
eraser dust everywhere. CAD does away with all the fuss and muss of moving
objects, and AutoCAD grip editing is a great way to make it happen. The fol-
lowing steps describe how to move objects:
1. Select one or more objects.
Use any combination of the three editing modes — single object, window
box, or crossing box — described in the “Grab It” section, earlier in this
chapter.
2. Click one of the grips to make it hot.
At this point in your editing career, it doesn’t matter which grip you
click. As you become more familiar with grip editing, you’ll discover that
certain grips serve as better reference points than others for particular
editing operations.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 

3. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Move from the
cursor menu.
4. Move the cursor to a different location and click.
As you move the cursor around, AutoCAD displays the tentative new
positions for all the objects, as shown in Figure 7-16. After you click, the
objects assume their new positions.
5. Press Esc to deselect all objects and remove all grips.
Copy, or a kinder, gentler Move
If you were paying attention during the section “A gripping example,” earlier
in the chapter, you may have noticed while pressing the spacebar that COPY
was not among the five grip-editing modes. Why not? Because every grip
mode includes a copy option (as the command line prompts shown in the
section, “A gripping example,” earlier in this chapter indicate). In other
words, you can STRETCH with copy, MOVE with copy, ROTATE with copy,
SCALE with copy, and MIRROR with copy.

Chapter 7: Edit for Credit

The copy option leaves the selected objects in place and does the editing
operation on a new copy of the objects.
By far the most common use for the copy option is with the MOVE grip-editing
mode. If you think about “MOVE with copy” for about two seconds, you’ll real-
ize that it’s just a complicated way of saying “copy.” The following steps show
how to copy objects quickly by using grip editing:
1. Select one or more objects.
2. Click any one of the grips to make it hot.
3. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Move from the
menu.
If you want to copy objects in the normal sense of the word “copy,” you
must choose the MOVE grip-editing mode first. Otherwise, you’ll be
copying with the STRETCH grip-editing mode.
4. Right-click again and choose Copy from the menu.
5. Move the cursor to a different location and click.
After you click, new objects appear in the new location.
6. Move the cursor to additional locations and click there if you want to
make additional copies.
7. Press Esc twice — once to end the copying operation and once to 
deselect all objects and remove all grips.
A warm-up Stretch
In AutoCAD, stretching is the process of making objects longer or shorter.
The STRETCH grip-editing operation is really a combination of stretching and
compressing, but the programmers probably realized that STRETCHAND-
COMPRESS didn’t exactly roll off the tongue.
The STRETCH grip-editing mode works differently than the other modes. By
default, it affects only the object with the hot grip on it, not all objects with
grips on them. You can override this default behavior by using the Shift key
to pick multiple hot grips. Follow these steps to get acquainted with using the
STRETCH grip-editing mode to stretch one or more objects:
1. Turn off ortho mode by clicking the ORTHO button on the status bar
until the button appears to be pushed out and the words <Ortho off>
appear on the command line.
Ortho mode forces stretch displacements to be orthogonal — that is,
parallel to lines running at 0 and 90 degrees. During real editing tasks,
you’ll often want to turn on ortho mode, but while you get acquainted
with stretching, leaving ortho mode off makes things clearer.
194
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

2. Select several objects, including at least one line.
3. On one of the lines, click one of the endpoint grips to make it hot.
All the objects remain selected, but as you move the cursor, only the line
with the hot grip changes. Figure 7-17 shows an example.
4. Click a new point for the hot endpoint grip.
The line stretches to accommodate the new endpoint location.
5. On the same line, click the midpoint grip to make it hot.
As you move the cursor, the entire line moves. Using the STRETCH grip-
editing mode with a line’s midpoint “stretches” the entire line to a new
location.
6. Click a new point for the hot midpoint grip.
The line moves to the new midpoint location.
7. On one of the lines, click one of the endpoint grips to make it hot.

8. Hold down the Shift key, and then click one of the endpoint grips on a
different line to make it hot.
Two grips on two different lines are now hot because you held down the
Shift key and clicked the second grip.
You can create more hot grips by holding down the Shift key and clicking
more grips.
9. Release the Shift key and re-pick any one of the hot grips.
Releasing the Shift key signals that you’re finished making grips hot. Re-
picking one of the hot grips establishes it as the base point for the
stretch operation (see Figure 7-18).
10. Click a new point for the grip.
All the objects with hot grips stretch based on the displacement of the
grip that you clicked in Step 9.
Multiple hot grips

11. Turn on ortho mode by clicking the ORTHO button on the status bar
until the button appears to be pushed in and the words <Ortho on>
appear on the command line. Repeat Steps 2 through 10 to see the
effect of ortho mode on stretching.
For most real-world editing situations, you’ll want to turn on ortho or polar
tracking mode before stretching. Ortho mode is good for all kinds of drawing
and editing tasks because it enforces a nice, rectilinear orderliness on your
drawing. Chapter 5 describes how to use ortho mode to draw orthogonal lines.
197
Chapter 7: Edit for Credit
Polishing those properties
When you think of editing objects, you probably
think first about editing their geometry: moving,
stretching, making new copies, and so on. That’s
the kind of editing we cover in this chapter.
Another kind of editing is changing objects’
properties. As we describe in Chapter 5, every
object in an AutoCAD drawing has a set of non-
geometrical properties, including layer, color,
linetype, and lineweight. Sometimes, you need
to edit those properties — when you acciden-
tally draw something on the wrong layer, for
example. Three common ways of editing
objects properties in AutoCAD are
 The Properties palette: This is the most flex-
ible way to edit properties. Select any
object (or objects), right-click in the draw-
ing area, and choose Properties from the
menu. The Properties palette displays a 
tabular grid that lists the names and values
of all properties. Click in the value cell to
change a particular property.
 Layers and Properties toolbars: Another
way to change properties is to select
objects and then choose from the drop-
down lists (Layer, Color, and so on) on the
Layers and the Properties toolbars. See
Chapter 5 for more information.
 Match Properties: You can use the Match
Properties 
button 
on 
the 
Standard
toolbar — the button with the paintbrush on
it — to paint properties from one object to
another. Match Properties works similarly to
the Format Painter button in Microsoft appli-
cations. Match Properties works even when
the objects reside in different drawings.

A Zoom with a View
In This Chapter
 Zooming and panning
 Naming and restoring views
 Zooming and panning in paper space layouts
 Regenerating the display
O
ne of the advantages of CAD over manual drawing is its capability of
giving you different ways to view your drawing. You can zoom in close,
zoom out to a great distance, and pan around. In fact, not only can you zoom
and pan in your drawing, but in most kinds of drawings, you must do it fre-
quently to be able to draw, edit, and view effectively.
Technical drawings are jam-packed with lines, text, and dimensions. Zooming
and panning frequently enables you to see the details better, draw more con-
fidently (because you can see what you’re doing), and edit more quickly
(because object selection is easier when there aren’t a zillion objects on the
screen). This chapter covers AutoCAD’s most useful display control features.
Zoom and Pan with Glass and Hand
Moving your viewpoint in to get a closer view of your drawing data is called
zooming in; moving your viewpoint back to get a more expansive view is
called zooming out.
Zooming in and out of your drawing is one of the big advantages that AutoCAD
offers over manual drawing. You can do detailed work on tiny objects and
then zoom out and move around rooms, houses, or neighborhoods from an
Olympian perspective.

Panning is closely related to zooming. If you zoom in enough that some of
your drawing no longer shows up on-screen, you’re going to want to pan
around — move left, right, up, and down in your drawing — without zooming
in and out. AutoCAD makes panning easy with scroll bars and real-time pan-
ning. And in case you’re wondering what real-time panning might be (as
opposed to pretend-time panning, maybe?), it simply means you can see the
objects coming closer and farther away as you drag the mouse up and down
or back and forth.
Both panning and zooming change what is known as the view. The view is the
current location and magnification of the AutoCAD depiction of your drawing.
Each time you zoom or pan, you establish a new view. You can give a name to
a specific view to make returning to that view easy, as we demonstrate later
in this chapter.
You’ll get a better sense of panning and zooming around a drawing if you actu-
ally have a drawing to look at. Draw some objects on the screen, or open one
of AutoCAD’s sample drawings located in the C:\Program Files\AutoCAD
2006\Sample folder. 
Fortunately, zooming and panning in AutoCAD is as simple as it is necessary.
The following steps describe how to use AutoCAD’s Zoom and Pan Realtime
feature, which is easy to operate and provides a lot of flexibility:
1. Click the Zoom Realtime button (the one that looks like a magnifying
glass with a plus/minus sign next to it) on the Standard toolbar.
The Realtime option of the Zoom command starts. The cursor changes
to a magnifying glass, and AutoCAD prompts you at the command line:
Press ESC or ENTER to exit, or right-click to display
shortcut menu.
2. Move the cursor near the middle of the screen, press and hold down
the left mouse button, and drag the cursor up and down until the
objects you want to see almost fill the screen.
Dragging up increases the zoom magnification and dragging down
decreases it.
3. Right-click in the drawing area and choose Pan from the menu that
appears (shown in Figure 8-1).
The cursor changes to a hand.
4. Click and drag to pan the drawing in any direction.
You can use the right-click menu to toggle back and forth between Zoom
and Pan as many times as you like. If you get lost, choose Zoom Original
or Zoom Extents to return to a recognizable view.
5. Right-click in the drawing area and choose Exit.
The cursor returns to the normal AutoCAD crosshairs.
200
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

In the preceding example, you started with zooming and ended with panning.
You also have the option of doing the reverse: Click the Pan Realtime button
(the one showing a hand), and after you’ve panned, use the right-click menu
to switch to zooming. However you start it, the important thing to realize is
that Zoom and Pan Realtime is a single AutoCAD function. At any time, you
can switch between panning and zooming (or switch to a related function,
such as Zoom Window) by using the right-click menu.
You also can pan and zoom by using your mouse’s scroll wheel (if it has one)
or the middle button of a three-button mouse:
 To zoom in and out, roll the scroll wheel forward (in) or backward (out).
 To zoom to the extents of your drawing, double-click the scroll wheel or
the middle button.
 To pan, hold down the scroll wheel or the middle button as you move
the mouse.
The scroll wheel or middle mouse button zoom and pan operations described
in the preceding list depend on an obscure AutoCAD system variable named
MBUTTONPAN. (See Chapter 2 for a description of what system variables are
and how to change them.) When MBUTTONPAN is set to 1 — the default
value — you can use the middle button to pan and zoom, as we describe in
the preceding list. If you change MBUTTONPAN to 0, clicking the middle
mouse button displays a cursor object snap menu, as it did in older AutoCAD
versions. If you’re not able to zoom or pan with your middle mouse button,
set MBUTTONPAN back to 1. (With MBUTTONPAN set to 1, you use
Shift+right-click to display the cursor object snap menu.)
Realtime zooming and panning is the easiest, most interactive way to get
around in your drawings. In some situations, though, this method is less effi-
cient or precise than the old-fashioned methods, the most important of
which are described in the next section.
Out of the frying pan . . .
Another way to pan in AutoCAD should be familiar from other Windows 
programs — the scroll bars in the drawing area. Scrolling is the same in

Chapter 8: A Zoom with a View

AutoCAD as in any other Windows program; click the arrows in the right and
bottom borders of the drawing window to scroll, or pan, a step at a time; or
click and drag the little square “thumbs” in those borders to pan as little or
as much as you want to.
Time to zoom
Because zooming is such a frequent necessity in AutoCAD, it’s worth knowing
some alternative ways of doing it.
The Zoom command has different options, the most important of which are
the following:
 All and Extents: Zoom Extents zooms out just far enough to show all
the objects in the current drawing. Zoom All does the same thing, unless
the drawings limits are larger than the extents, in which case Zoom All
zooms to show the entire rectangular area defined by the limits. If you’ve
defined your limits properly (see Chapter 4), Zoom All is a good way to
see your whole drawing area. These two options are especially useful
when you zoom in too small or pan off into empty space and want to see
your entire drawing again.
It’s a good idea to Zoom All or Zoom Extents and then save before you
close a drawing. By performing these steps, you ensure the following:
• The next person who opens the drawing — whether it’s you or
someone else — can see the full drawing from the very beginning.
• The drawing preview that displays in the Select File dialog box dis-
plays the full drawing, instead of just a tiny, unidentifiable corner
of it.
 Window: This option is great for zooming in quickly and precisely. It
zooms to a section of your drawing that you specify by clicking two
points. The two points define the diagonal of a window around the area
you want to look at. (Note that the Zoom command’s Window option is
not a click-and-drag operation — unlike in some other Windows pro-
grams and, confusingly, unlike in the Zoom/Pan realtime Zoom Window
option. With the Zoom command’s Window option, you click one corner,
release the mouse button, and then click the other corner.)
 Scale (X/XP): The X option zooms by a percentage of the current display;
values less than 1 cause you to zoom in, values greater than 1 cause you
to zoom out. You can also think of the value as a scaling factor: 0.5X
causes the screen image to shrink to half its apparent size, and 2X causes
the screen image to double its apparent size. (The XP option after a
number is for zooming model space objects in a viewport relative to
paper space; see Chapter 4 for information about paper space.)
202
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

 Realtime: Realtime zooming, the technique described previously, enables
you to zoom in and out by starting a realtime zoom and then moving the
cursor up to zoom in or down to zoom out.
 Previous: This option undoes the last zoom and/or pan sequence. It’s
like going back in time but without the funny costumes!
 Object: This option zooms in close enough to show selected objects as
large as they can be displayed on-screen. Think of zoom object as
AutoCAD’s microscope.
AutoCAD 2006 provides smooth view transitions whenever you use the non-
realtime pan and zoom commands. The thinking is that, sometimes you can
get lost if you do a zoom all from a small, highly magnified area. It’s not a
good idea to leave a trail of breadcrumbs across your screen, so these slow
motion pans and zooms may be a good idea, at least until you do know your
way out of the forest . . . or your drawing. If, like us, you find that this feature
gets old fast, luckily there’s a system variable called VTENABLE that lets you
turn it off. (You knew there’d be one of those, didn’t you?) 
Some of the zoom options take some getting used to. We recommend that
you use realtime zoom and pan for most of your zooming and panning.
Supplement it with Zoom Window to move quickly into a precise area, Zoom
Previous to back up in zoom/pan time, and Zoom All or Zoom Extents to view
your whole drawing.
A View by Any Other Name . . .
If you find yourself repeatedly zooming and panning to the same area, you
probably can get there faster with a named view. A named view is a name that
you assign to a particular region of your drawing. After you create a named
view, you can return to that region quickly by restoring the view. You use the
View command, which displays the View dialog box, to create and restore
named views. Follow these steps to create a named view:
1. Zoom and pan until you find the view that you want to assign a
name to.
2. Choose View➪Named Views.
The View dialog box appears.
3. Click the New button.
The New View dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-2.
203
Chapter 8: A Zoom with a View

4. Type a name in the View Name text box.
5. (Optional) Type a new category in the View Category box, or select an
existing one from the drop-down list.
You use View Categories to organize views and certain display charac-
teristics of views in sheet sets, as described in Chapter 14. Until you use
the sheet sets feature, you can leave this box blank.
6. Select the Current Display radio button, if it’s not selected already.
If you want to name a region other than the currently displayed view,
select the Define Window radio button instead, click the Define View
Window button to the right of it, and pick two corners of the region’s
rectangle (as though you were zooming windows).
7. Confirm or change the choices in the Settings area.
If you turn on the Store Current Layer Settings with View option, then
when you later restore the view, AutoCAD also will restore the layer visi-
bility settings (on/off and freeze/thaw) that were in effect when you cre-
ated the view. (Chapter 5 describes the layer visibility settings.) The two
UCS-related settings are primarily for 3D drawings. If you’re creating 2D
drawings, you can ignore the UCS settings.
8. Click OK.
The New View dialog box disappears, and you see your new named view
in the list in the View dialog box.
9. Click OK.
The View dialog box disappears.
Figure 8-2:
Create a
new view

204
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

To restore a named view, choose View➪Named Views or enter View at the
command line to display the View dialog box. Click the name of the view that
you want to restore, click the Set Current button, and then click OK to close
the dialog box.
You also can plot the area defined by a named view. See Chapter 12 for
instructions on plotting views.
Looking Around in Layout Land
All the zoom, pan, and view operations we describe in this chapter apply to
paper space layouts as well as to model space. (Chapter 4 describes the dif-
ference between model space and paper space and how to navigate between
the two.) One little complication exists, though: In a paper space layout —
that is, any drawing area tab except for the Model tab — it’s possible for
the cursor to be either in paper space or in model space inside a viewport.
Zooming and panning have a different effect depending on which space your
cursor is in at the moment. Experiment with the different effects by following
these steps:
1. Open a drawing that contains at least one paper space layout with a
title block and one or more viewports.
If you don’t have any such drawings handy, try using the AutoCAD sample
drawing located at C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2006\Sample\Welding
Fixture-1.dwg.
2. Click one of the layout tabs — that is, any tab other than the Model tab.
AutoCAD displays the paper space layout for that tab, including any title
block and viewports.
3. Click the PAPER/MODEL button on the status bar until it says PAPER.
Alternatively, you can double-click in the gray part of the drawing area
outside of the layout.
The cursor is now in paper space, so zooming and panning changes the
display of all the objects in the layout, including the title block.
4. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
AutoCAD displays the entire layout, as shown in Figure 8-3.
5. Zoom and pan by using any of the techniques described in this chapter.
Zooming and panning change the appearance of the title block, as
shown in Figure 8-4. The effect is similar to moving a plotted sheet in
and out and all around in front of your face.

6. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
AutoCAD displays the entire layout again.
7. Click the PAPER/MODEL button on the status bar until it says MODEL.
Alternatively, you can double-click with the cursor over a viewport.
The cursor is now in model space, inside the viewport, so zooming and
panning change only the display of the objects that are visible in the
viewport. The display of the title block doesn’t change.
8. Zoom and pan by using any of the techniques described in this chapter.
Zooming and panning don’t change the appearance of the title block, as
shown in Figure 8-5. The result looks as if you’re moving a picture of the
model space geometry in and out and all around behind a frame.
In real drawings, you usually shouldn’t zoom and pan inside viewports
after they’ve been set up (see Chapter 4). Doing so changes the scale of
the viewport, which messes up plotting. We’re asking you to do it here
to illustrate the difference between zooming in paper space and zooming
in a model space viewport.
Model space icon
Figure 8-5:

207
Chapter 8: A Zoom with a View

If the title block is changing when you zoom and pan, someone has locked
the viewport to prevent the kind of mischief that we warn against in the
previous paragraph. (You also see the command line prompt Viewport
is view-locked. Switching to Paper space.) See “viewports, float-
ing, locking” in the AutoCAD online help system if you need to lock — or
unlock — viewports.
9. Choose View➪Zoom➪Previous one or more times until you’ve restored
the original view.
10. Click the PAPER/MODEL button on the status bar until is says PAPER.
Always leave the cursor in paper space when you’re finished.
11. Choose File➪Close and click the No button to close the drawing with-
out saving changes.
In this example, we have you close the drawing without saving changes,
just in case you did mess up the viewport zoom scale.
In most cases, you set up a paper space layout once, as described in Chapter 4,
and then just return to it to plot. You shouldn’t be spending a lot of time zoom-
ing and panning in paper space layouts. You zoom and pan to get a better view
of what you’re drawing and editing, and that’s what the Model tab is for. But if
you do want to zoom in paper space — to get a better look at part of your title
block, for example — make sure that you’re doing it with the PAPER/MODEL
button set to PAPER.
The VPMAX and VPMIN commands allow you to maximize and minimize a
viewport in the current layout. These commands provide an alternative to
switching between the Model and Layout tabs without the potential problems
of zooming inside of paper space viewports. The easiest way to run VPMAX
or VPMIN is to click the Maximize Viewport/Minimize Viewport button
located on the status bar, just to the right of the PAPER button.
Degenerating and Regenerating
As you zoom and pan around your drawing, you may wonder how the image
that you see on-screen is related to the DWG file that AutoCAD saves on the
hard disk. Well, maybe you don’t wonder about that, but we’re going to tell
you anyway!
When you draw and edit objects, AutoCAD stores all their geometrical prop-
erties (that is, location and size) in a highly precise form — technically,
208
Part II: Let There Be Lines 

double floating-point precision. The program always maintains that precision
when you save the DWG file. For computer performance reasons, however,
AutoCAD does not use that high-precision form of the data to display your
drawing on-screen. Instead, AutoCAD converts the highly precise numbers in
the DWG file into slightly less precise integers in order to create the view that
you see on-screen.
The happy consequence of this conversion is that zooming, panning, and
other display changes are a lot faster than they would be otherwise. The
unhappy consequence is that the conversion, which is called a regeneration
(or regen for short), occasionally leaves you with some artifacts to deal with.
In most cases, AutoCAD performs regenerations automatically when it needs
to. You sometimes will see command line messages like Regenerating model
or Regenerating layout, which indicate that AutoCAD is taking care of
regens for you.
If, on the other hand, you see the command line message Regen queued,
then AutoCAD is warning you that it’s not performing a regeneration, even
though one might be advisable now. In addition, you might see a warning
dialog box with the message “About to regen -- proceed?” These mes-
sages are AutoCAD’s way of saying, “What your drawing looks like on the
screen at the moment may not exactly match the real version of the drawing
database that gets stored when you save the drawing. I’ll update the display
version at the next regeneration.”
The REGENAUTO system variable controls whether or not AutoCAD performs
most regenerations automatically (see Chapter 2 if you’re unfamiliar with
system variables or how to change them):
 The default REGENAUTO setting in new drawings, 1, tells AutoCAD to
regenerate your drawing automatically if it’s required to synchronize the
screen display with the drawing database.
 The other REGENAUTO setting, 0 (Off), tells AutoCAD not to regenerate
automatically, but instead to display Regen queued on the command
line and let you force a regeneration with the REgen command if you
want to.
The REGENAUTO off option is for the most part a holdover from much slower
computers and older versions of AutoCAD. You probably don’t need to sub-
ject yourself to the mental contortion of trying to avoid REgens unless you
work on huge drawings and/or use a painfully slow computer.
209
Chapter 8: A Zoom with a View

Don’t confuse the REgen command with the Redraw command. REgen (View➪
Regen) forces the synchronization process described in this section. Redraw
(View➪Redraw) simply repaints the screen, without attempting to synchro-
nize the screen with the drawing database. The Redraw command was useful
in the days of very slow computers and older versions of AutoCAD, which
didn’t handle the display as effectively, but it’s essentially a useless com-
mand now.
The REgenAll command (View➪Regen All) regenerates all viewports in a
paper space layout. If you run the REgenAll command in model space, it has
the same effect as the ordinary REgen command.

T
ext, dimensions, and hatching have long been impor-
tant clarifying elements in drafting. In AutoCAD, these
elements are flexible almost to a fault, and you can edit
and update them quickly as you change the geometry
beneath them. The text, dimension, and hatching annota-
tions that you add “speak” about the geometry so that
others can understand exactly what, how big, and how far. 
After you’ve made some drawings that talk, you’ll proba-
bly send the message around by printing — or as CAD
users call it, plotting — them. AutoCAD 2006’s streamlined
Plot dialog box makes the often-complex task of plotting
a little less daunting. Chapter 12 is your passport to navi-
gating the revised plot process, understanding how the
legacy of AutoCAD plotting influences current practice,
and most of all getting a good-looking, properly scaled
plot onto paper.

lthough it’s often true that “A picture is worth a thousand words,” it’s
also true that adding a few words to your drawing can save you from
having to draw a thousand lines and arcs. It’s a lot easier to write “Simpson
A35 framing clip” next to a simple, schematic representation of a clip than to
draw one in photorealistic detail and hope that the contractor can figure out
what it is!
Most CAD drawings include some text in the form of explanatory notes, objects
labels, and titles. This chapter demonstrates how to add text to drawings and
shows you how to take advantage of AutoCAD text styles and the spelling
checker. Chapter 10 covers text that’s connected with dimensions and leaders.
In most cases, adding text, dimensions, and other descriptive symbols is
something that you should do later in the drafting process, after you’ve
drawn at least some of the geometry. In CAD drawings, text and other annota-
tions usually are intended to complement the geometry, not to stand alone.
Thus, you generally need to have the geometry in place before you annotate
it. Many drafters find that it’s most efficient to draw as much geometry as
possible first, and then add text labels and dimensions to all the geometry at
the same time. In this way, you develop a rhythm with the text and dimen-
sioning commands, instead of bouncing back and forth between drawing
geometry and adding annotations. (It helps if you hum “I’ve got rhythm . . .”
while sliding the mouse back and forth in time.)

Getting Ready to Write
In AutoCAD, adding text to a drawing is only slightly more complicated than
adding it to a word processing document. Here are the steps:
1. Create a new AutoCAD text style, or select an existing style, that
includes the font and other text characteristics you want to use.
2. Make an appropriate text layer current.
3. Run one of these commands to draw text:
• mText draws paragraph (also called multiline) text.
• TEXT draws single-line text.
4. Specify the text alignment points, justification, and height.
5. Type the text.
You’re probably familiar with most of these steps already — especially if you’ve
ever used a word processor. In the next few sections of this chapter, we review
the particularities of AutoCAD text styles, the two kinds of AutoCAD text, and
ways of controlling height and justification.
Simply stylish text
AutoCAD assigns text properties to individual lines or paragraphs of text
based on text styles. These text styles are similar to the paragraph styles in
Microsoft Word: They contain font and other settings that determine the look
and feel of text. An AutoCAD text style includes
 The font
 A font height, which you can set or leave at 0 for later flexibility
 Special effects such as italic
 Really special effects such as vertical and upside down, which almost
nobody uses
Before you add text to a drawing, use the Text Style dialog box — choose
Format➪Text Style to open it — to select an existing style or create a new one
with settings that are appropriate to your purpose. Your AutoCAD notes may
generate strange responses (or no response at all) if they appear in Old Persian
Cuneiform or the Cyrillic alphabet.
214
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Most drawings require very few text styles. You can create one style for all
notes, object labels, and annotations, and another one for special titles. A
title block may require one or two additional fonts, especially if you want to
mimic the font used in a company logo or project logo.
As with layers, your office may have its own text style standards. If so, you’ll
make everyone happy by following those standards. One of the best ways to
make your use of text styles efficient and consistent is to create them in a tem-
plate drawing that you use to start new drawings. (If your office is well orga-
nized, it may already have a template drawing with the company-approved
styles defined in it.) See Chapter 4 for information about creating and using
templates. Another handy technique is to copy existing text styles from one
drawing to another by using the DesignCenter palette. See Chapter 5 for
instructions.
Font follies
When you create a text style in AutoCAD, you have a choice of a huge number
of fonts. AutoCAD can use two different kinds of fonts: native AutoCAD SHX
(compiled SHape) fonts and Windows TTF (TrueType) fonts:
 SHX: In the Text Style dialog box, SHX font names appear with a drafting
compass to the left of the name. SHX fonts usually provide better perfor-
mance because they’re optimized for AutoCAD’s use.
 TTF: In the Text Style dialog box, TrueType font names appear with a
TT symbol to the left of name. TTF fonts give you more and fancier font
options, but they slow down AutoCAD when you zoom, pan, and select
and snap to objects. TrueType fonts also can cause greater complica-
tions when you exchange drawings with other AutoCAD users. Chapter 16
describes the special procedure that you need to use in order to install
custom TrueType fonts.
It’s okay to use a TrueType font sparingly for something like a title block logo,
but in general, you should stick with standard AutoCAD SHX fonts whenever
possible.
The most popular AutoCAD font is ROMANS.SHX (Roman Simplex). (You may
also run into SIMPLEX.SHX, an older version of Roman Simplex.) ROMANS.SHX
is a good, general-purpose font for drafting in AutoCAD. Avoid complicated,
thick fonts. They can slow down AutoCAD, and they’re usually more difficult
to read than the simpler fonts. Remember, you’re doing CAD here — not fancy
graphic design or reproduction of medieval manuscripts!
215
Chapter 9: Text with Character

Whenever possible, avoid custom fonts, which are font files that don’t come
with AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT (both programs come with the same fonts).
AutoCAD installs its standard SHX fonts into the C:\Program Files\
AutoCAD 2006\Fonts folder — as long as you haven’t added any custom
fonts to that folder, you can refer to it for a list of standard fonts. If you use a
custom font, exchanging your drawings with other people will be more com-
plicated. If you’re compelled to use a custom font, make a note of it and
remember either to send it whenever you send the DWG file (assuming that
the font isn’t copyrighted, which many custom fonts are) or to warn the
recipients that the text will appear different on their systems. It’s far less
hassle to eschew custom fonts altogether. See Chapter 16 for additional infor-
mation about how to deal with fonts when you send and receive drawings.
Get in style
The following steps describe how to select an existing text style or create a
new one before you enter text into a drawing. (If you want to experiment
with an existing drawing that contains a variety of text styles, you can use
C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2006\Sample\Hummer Elevation.dwg.)
1. Choose Format➪Text Style.
The Text Style dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-1.
2. In the Style Name drop-down list, select each style in turn to see what
text styles have been created in this drawing.
Note the font name and look at the Preview panel to get a feel for what
the different fonts look like.
3. If you find a suitable text style, select it in the Style Name drop-down
list and then skip to Step 8.
What constitutes a suitable text style depends on industry practices,
office standards, and personal preferences about how the text should
Figure 9-1:
Text with
style.
216
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

look. The information in preceding sections may help you decide. If not,
ask an experienced drafter in your office or look at some printed draw-
ings and try to match the text on those.
The selected text style name becomes the current style.
4. If you don’t find a suitable text style, or if you prefer to create your
own text style, click New.
The New Text Style dialog box appears, with a text box for you to type a
name.
5. Type a name for your new text style and then click OK.
Your new text style is added to the Style Name list and becomes the cur-
rent style.
6. Choose a font from the Font Name list.
ROMANS.SHX is the best all-purpose font for most drafting work. If you’d
like to use a different font, review the font suggestions and warnings in
the previous section.
The font that you choose becomes the font that’s assigned to your new
text style.
7. Set the remaining text style settings as shown in Figure 9-1: Height =
0.0, Width Factor = 1.0, Oblique Angle = 0.0, and all four check boxes
unchecked.
A text style height of 0.0 makes the style variable height, which means
that you can specify the height separately for each single-line text object.
Assigning a fixed (that is, nonzero) height to a text style forces all single-
line text using the style to be the same height. Variable height styles are
more flexible, but fixed height styles usually make it easier to draw text of
consistent height. The decision to use variable height versus fixed height
styles is another aspect of text that depends on office practice, so if you
work with other AutoCAD users, ask around.
8. Click Apply.
9. Click Close.
The Text Style dialog box closes, and the text style that you selected or
created is now the current style for new text objects.
Taking your text to new heights
In Chapter 4, we describe the importance of choosing an appropriate drawing
scale when you set up a drawing. We warn you that you need to know the
drawing scale factor for tasks described in other chapters of this book. This
is one of those chapters, and we’re about to explain one of those tasks!
217
Chapter 9: Text with Character

Drawing scale is the traditional way of describing a scale with an equal sign
or colon — for example 1⁄4" = 1'–0", 1:20, or 2:1. The drawing scale factor repre-
sents the same relationship with a single number such as 48, 20, or 0.5. The
drawing scale factor is the multiplier that converts the first number in the
drawing scale into the second number.
One of the things that distinguishes knowledgeable CAD users is that they
always know the drawing scale factor of any drawing they’re working on.
Make it a point to determine the drawing scale factor of a drawing before you
add text to it.
Plotted text height
Most industries have plotted text height standards. A plotted text height of
1⁄8 inch or 3 mm is common for notes. Some companies use slightly smaller
heights (for example, 3⁄32 inch or 2.5 mm) to squeeze more text into small
spaces.
218
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Attack of the giant text strings
“Why do I need to know the drawing scale
factor in order to draw text?” You may ask —
especially if you’ve spent time “on the boards,”
as we grizzled old-timers like to call manual
drafting. You need to know the drawing scale
factor because you handle scaling of objects
and text in CAD opposite from the way you do in
manual drafting.
In manual drafting, you squeeze real-world
objects (the building, widget, or whatever) down
by a specific scale factor, like 10 or 48, so that
they fit nicely on a sheet of paper. Naturally, you
always draw text the size that you want it
to appear on the paper (for example, 1⁄8 inch or
3 mm high), regardless of the scale of the 
drawing.
In CAD drafting, you draw objects as if they
were at their actual size. Then, when you plot,
you shrink — or, if you make drawings of
tiny things such as microprocessor circuitry,
expand — the entire drawing by that same
scale factor (for example, 10 or 48) to fit on the
paper. When you shrink the whole drawing to fit
on the paper, text shrinks, too. To avoid indeci-
pherably small text, or incredibly large text, you
must create text at a size that’s scaled appro-
priately by the drawing scale factor. (If you’re an
architect, imagine that your text is neon letter-
ing on the side of the building. If you’re a
mechanical designer, think of a brand name
stamped on the side of a screw.)
For example, assume that someone has drawn
a widget at a scale of 1:20 (corresponding to a
drawing scale factor of 20), and you want your
notes to appear 3 mm high when the drawing is
plotted to scale. You need to create text that’s
20 times 3 mm, or 60 mm, high. In a building plan
drawn at a scale of 1⁄4" = 1'–0" (drawing scale
factor equals 48), text that will appear 1⁄8 inch
when plotted needs to be 1⁄8 inch times 48, or 6
inches, high.
This tiny text/enormous text approach seems
peculiar at first, especially if you were schooled
in manual drafting. But it’s a consequence of
CAD’s ability to let you draw and measure the
geometry in real-world units. After all, the
geometry of what you’re representing, not the
ancillary notes, usually is the main point of the
drawing.

Calculating AutoCAD text height
To calculate AutoCAD text height, you need to know the drawing scale factor,
the desired plotted text height, and the location of the multiplication button
on your calculator. Use the following steps to figure out text height:
1. Determine the drawing’s drawing scale factor.
If you set up the drawing, you should know its drawing scale, as described
in Chapter 4. If someone else set up the drawing, try the suggestions in
the nearby sidebar, “Figuring out a drawing’s scale factor.”
2. Determine the height that your notes should appear when you plot
the drawing to scale.
See the “Plotted text height” section for suggestions.
3. Multiply the numbers that you figured out in Steps 1 and 2.
Table 9-1 lists some common drawing scales and text heights for drawings
in imperial and metric units. You should know how to calculate the drawing
scale factors and text heights, but you’re allowed to use the table to check
your work. (Hint: Multiply the number in the second column by the number
in the third column to get the number in the fourth column!) The Cheat Sheet

After you know the AutoCAD text height, you can use it to define the height
of a text style or of an individual text object. If you assign a nonzero height
to a text style (Step 7 in the “Get in style” section, earlier in this chapter), all
single-line text strings that you create with that style will use the fixed height.
If you leave the text style’s height set to zero, AutoCAD asks you for the text
height when you draw each single-line text object.
219
Chapter 9: Text with Character

This discussion of text height assumes that you’re adding text in model space,
which is the most common practice. You may want to add text to a paper
space layout — for example, when you draw text in a title block or add a set of
sheet notes that doesn’t directly relate to the model space geometry. When
you create text in paper space, you specify the actual, plotted height, instead
of the scaled-up height.
One line or two?
For historical reasons (namely, because the AutoCAD text capabilities used to
be much more primitive than they are now), AutoCAD offers two different
kinds of text objects and two corresponding text-drawing commands. Table
9-2 explains the two options.
Table 9-2
The Two Kinds of AutoCAD Text

Paragraph text
mText
Designed for multiple lines, with word-
wrapping. AutoCAD keeps the multiple
lines together as a single object. Other
special formatting, such as numbered
and bulleted lists, is possible.
Single-line text
TEXT
Designed for creating single lines.
Although you can press Enter to create
more than one line of text, each line
becomes a separate text object.
220
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Figuring out a drawing’s scale factor
If you’re adding text to a drawing that someone
else created, you may not immediately know its
drawing scale factor. In some cases, making the
determination is trivial, whereas in other cases
it’s tricky indeed. Here are some methods you
can use:
 Ask the creator of the drawing.
 Look for text or a scale bar on the drawing
that indicates the scale.
 Use an architectural or engineering scale to
measure distances on the plotted drawing,
if you have one.
 Check the value of the DIMSCALE
(DIMension SCALE) system variable, as
described in Chapter 10.
None of these methods is infallible by itself, but
by comparing the evidence, you usually can
figure out the drawing scale factor with rea-
sonable certainty.

Although you may be inclined to ignore the older single-line text option, it’s
worth knowing how to use both kinds of text. The TEXT command is a bit
simpler than the mText command, so it’s still useful for entering short, single-
line pieces of text such as object labels and one-line notes. And it’s the com-
mand of choice for CAD comedians who want to document their one-liners!
Your text will be justified
Both the TEXT and mText commands offer a bewildering array of text justifi-
cation options — in other words, which way the text flows from the justifica-
tion point or points that you pick in the drawing. For most purposes, the
default Left justification for single-line text or Top Left justification for para-
graph text works fine. Occasionally, you may want to use a different justifica-
tion, such as Centered for labels or titles. Both commands provide options
for changing text justification. We point out these options when we demon-
strate the commands later in this chapter.
Using the Same Old Line
Despite its limitations, the TEXT command is useful for labels and other
short notes for which mText would be overkill. The following procedure
shows you how to enter text by using the AutoCAD TEXT command.
You can use TEXT for multiple lines of text: Just keep pressing Enter after you
type each line of text, and TEXT puts the new line below the previous one. The
problem with this approach is that TEXT creates each line of text as a separate
object. If you later want to add or remove words in the multiple lines, AutoCAD
can’t do any word-wrapping for you; you have to edit each line separately, cut-
ting words from one line and adding them to the adjacent line.
AutoCAD’s TEXT command was called DTEXT (Dynamic TEXT) in older ver-
sions of the program (Release 14 and earlier). You may hear AutoCAD old-
timers refer to the DTEXT command instead of TEXT. And you thought they
called it DTEXT because it wasn’t good enough to be A, B, or C text. . . .
The TEXT command does not use a dialog box or a fancy editing window like
the mText command’s Multiline Text Editor. You set options by typing them
into the command line or the dynamic cursor.
Here’s how you enter text with the TEXT command:
1. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 5.
2. Set an appropriate text style current, as described in the section
“Simply stylish text,” earlier in this chapter.
221
Chapter 9: Text with Character

3. Use the OSNAP button on the status bar to turn off running object
snap mode.
You usually don’t want to snap text to existing objects.
4. Choose Draw➪Text➪Single Line Text to start the TEXT command.
The Text button on the Draw toolbar starts the multiline text command,
mText, which we cover in the next section.
AutoCAD tells you the current text style and height settings and prompts
you to select a starting point for the text, or to choose an option for
changing the text justification or current text style first:
Current text style: “Standard” Text height: 0.2000
Specify start point of text or [Justify/Style]:
5. If you want to change justification from the default (lower left), type J,
press Enter, and choose one of the other justification options.
Look up “single-line text, aligning” in the online help system if you need
help with the justification options.
6. Specify the insertion point for the first text character.
You can enter the point’s coordinates from the keyboard, use the mouse
to click a point on-screen, or press Enter to locate new text immediately
below the most recent single-line text object that you created.
AutoCAD prompts you for the text height:
Specify height <0.2000>:
7. Specify the height for the text.
This prompt doesn’t appear if you’re using a text style with a fixed (that
is, nonzero) height. See the “Simply stylish text” section, earlier in this
chapter, for information about fixed versus variable text heights.
AutoCAD prompts you for the text rotation angle:
Specify rotation angle of text <0>:
8. Specify the text rotation angle by typing the rotation angle and press-
ing Enter or by rotating the line on-screen with the mouse.
AutoCAD prompts you to type the text:
Enter text:
9. Type the first line of text and press Enter.
10. Type additional lines of text, pressing Enter at the end of each line.
Figure 9-2 shows text appearing on-screen as you type it.
11. To complete the command, press Enter at the start of a blank line.
AutoCAD adds the new single-line text object — or objects, if you typed
more than one line — to the drawing.
222
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

To align lines of text exactly, make sure that you type in all the lines in one
invocation of the TEXT command, pressing Enter after each line to make the
next line appear just after it. Otherwise, aligning different lines of text pre-
cisely is harder to do (unless you set your snap just right or use a compli-
cated combination of object snaps and point filters).
To edit single-line text after you’ve created it, select the text, right-click, and
choose Edit. 
AutoCAD 2006 replaces the old Edit Text dialog box with a new in-place text
editor. You now edit text at its exact size and location in the drawing. We tell
you more about in-place text editing later in this chapter.
An in-place editing box highlights the selected text object, enabling you to
edit the contents of the text string. If you want to edit other text properties,
such as text height, select the text, right-click, and choose Properties to dis-
play the Properties palette. Use the Properties palette to change parameters
as needed.

Chapter 9: Text with Character

Saying More in Multiline Text
When you just can’t shoehorn your creative genius into one or more one-line
pieces of text, the AutoCAD multiline text object gives you room to go on and
on and on. The following procedure shows you how to create text paragraphs
with the mText (multiline Text) command.
Making it with mText
The first part of the mText command prompts you for various points and
options. The order is a bit confusing, so read these steps and the prompts
carefully.
Here’s how you use the mText command:
1. Set an appropriate layer and text style current and turn off running
object snaps, as in Steps 1 through 3 in the previous section.
2. Click the Multiline Text button on the Draw toolbar.
The command line displays the current text style and height settings
and prompts you to select the first corner of an imaginary rectangle that
will determine the word-wrapping width for the text object:
Current text style:  “S-NOTES”  Text height:  0.125
Specify first corner:
3. Pick a point in the drawing.
The command line prompts you for the opposite corner of the text rec-
tangle that will determine the word-wrapping width and gives you the
option of changing settings first:
Specify opposite corner or [Height/Justify/Line
spacing/Rotation/Style/Width]:
4. Type H and press Enter to change the default text height.
The command line prompts you for a new default text height:
Specify height <0.2000>:
5. Type an appropriate text height.
See the “Taking your text to new heights” section, earlier in this chapter,
for information. If you’re adding text in model space, remember to use
the scaled AutoCAD text height, not the plotted text height.
The prompt for the opposite corner of the mText rectangle reappears.
The command line shows:
Specify opposite corner or [Height/Justify/Line
spacing/Rotation/Style/Width]:
224
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

6. If you want to change justification from the default (top left), type J,
press Enter, and choose one of the other justification options.
Look up “multiline text, aligning, Justify Multiline Text” in the index of
the online help system if you want an explanation of the other justifica-
tion options.
7. Pick another point in the drawing.
Don’t worry about the height of the rectangle that you create by choosing
the second point; the width of the rectangle is all that matters. AutoCAD
adjusts the height of the text rectangle to accommodate the number of
lines of word-wrapped text. Don’t worry too much about the width, either;
you can adjust it later.
The Multiline Text Editor frameless window appears with the tab and
indent ruler above it and the Text Formatting toolbar above that, as
shown in Figure 9-3.

8. Verify the text font and height.
The text font and height should be right if you correctly performed
Steps 1, 4, and 5. If not, you can change these settings in the Font drop-
down list and the Font Height text box in the Text Formatting toolbar.
9. Type text into the text area of the dialog box.
AutoCAD word wraps multiline text automatically. If you want to force a
line break at a particular location, press Enter.
By convention in most industries, text in drawings is always in upper-
case. How many times have you forgotten to press the Caps Lock key
before entering drawing text? How many times have you forgotten to
turn Caps Lock off again when it’s time to type your e-mail? To save
yourself some agony, right-click in the text editor window and choose
AutoCAPS from the menu. 
10. If you want other formatting, select text, right-click, and select the
appropriate option from the menu (as shown in Figure 9-4).

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

11. Click OK in the Text Formatting toolbar (or press Ctrl+Enter).
The Multiline Text Editor window closes, and AutoCAD adds your text to
the drawing.
As you can tell by looking at the Text Formatting toolbar and multiline text
right-click menu — both of which are expanded in AutoCAD 2006 — the
mText command gives you plenty of other options. You can show or hide the
toolbar, the ruler, or the Options buttons, and you can give the in-place editor
an opaque background. Right-clicking gives you access to new numbered and
bulleted lists and a shortcut to the New Features Workshop entry on multi-
line text.
Between them, the Text Formatting toolbar and the right-click menu also
include a Stack/Unstack button for fractions, access to the Indents and Tabs
feature, a Find and Replace utility, tools for changing between lower- and
uppercase, options for applying background masks and inserting fields, a
special Symbol submenu, and an Import Text option for importing text from
a TXT (ASCII text) file or RTF (Rich Text Format) file. 
We discuss background masks and fields in the next section. If you think you
may have a use for any of these other features, choose Contents➪Command
Reference➪Commands➪M Commands➪MTEXT in AutoCAD’s online help.
It slices, it dices . . .
AutoCAD 2005 added two more options to the multiline text right-click menu:
Insert Field and Background Mask. Although these features haven’t changed
in AutoCAD 2006, they’re both useful enough to merit a closer look.
mText dons a mask
When you turn on background masking, AutoCAD hides the portions of any
objects that lie underneath the text. Use these steps to turn on and control
this feature:
1. Right-click in the Multiline Text Editor window and choose
Background Mask from the menu.
The Background Mask dialog box appears.
2. Click the Use Background Mask check box so that this option is
turned on.
227
Chapter 9: Text with Character

3. Either click Use Background (to make the mask the same color as the
drawing area’s background color) or choose a color from the drop-
down list (to make the text appear in a solid rectangle of the specified
color).
4. Click OK to return to the Multiline Text Editor window.
If you’ve turned on background masking but it isn’t having the desired effect,
use the DRaworder or TEXTTOFRONT command to move text “on top of”
other objects.
mText plays the field
The Insert Field option creates a text field that updates automatically every
time you open, save, plot, or regenerate the drawing. These fields can contain
data such as the date, filename, or author. Fields draw information from the
operating system settings, Drawing Properties dialog box, sheet sets feature,
and AutoCAD system variables. (For more information about system vari-
ables, see Chapter 2.) Use the following procedure to add a field while you’re
creating mText:
1. Right-click in the Multiline Text Editor window and choose Insert
Field from the menu.
The Field dialog box appears.
2. Choose a Field Name in the left column.
3. Choose a Format in the right column, or for date fields, type a format
in the Date Format box.
4. Click OK.
AutoCAD adds the field to the mText object that you’re creating or 
editing.
If you see four dashes instead of a valid field value, you probably need to do
one of the following things:
 Regenerate the drawing (see Chapter 8).
 Save the drawing.
 Fill in Drawing Properties dialog box values (see Chapter 4) and then
regenerate the drawing.
 Configure sheet sets (see Chapter 14).
Figure 9-5 shows fields and background masking in action.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Doing a number on your mText Lists
Another advantage of mText is that it supports bulleted and numbered lists.
This feature is especially useful for creating general drawing notes, as shown
in Figure 9-6. AutoCAD 2005 made a start on this type of formatting, with its
hanging indents (still available, if you ever want to add some dangling modi-
fiers). AutoCAD 2006 automates the process of creating numbered lists
almost completely. Here’s how:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 8 in the previous section “Making it with
mText.”
2. Type a title; for example, DESIGN CRITERIA. 
If you’d like to have your title underlined, click Underline on the Text
Formatting toolbar before you type the title, and then click Underline
again to turn it off. Press Enter to go to the next line and Enter again to
leave a little more space.
Figure 9-5:
mText plays
the field and

Chapter 9: Text with Character

3. Right-click inside the text editing window and choose Bullets and Lists
from the menu; then enable Numbering On, Auto-List, and Numbered.
The number 1 followed by a period appears on the current line, and the
cursor jumps to the tab stop visible in the ruler at the top of the
Multiline Text Editor’s frameless window.
Numbered places numerals followed by periods in front of items in a list.
(Bulleted places bullet characters in front of items in a list.) Auto-list
enables automatic numbering — each time you press Enter to move to
a new line, its number increments. 
4. Type the text corresponding to the current number or bullet.
As AutoCAD wraps the text, the second and subsequent lines align with
the tab stop — that is, the text is automatically indented.
5. Press Enter at the end of the paragraph to move to the next line.
Just like creating numbered lists in your favorite word processor,
AutoCAD automatically inserts the next number at the beginning of the
new paragraph, with everything perfectly aligned, as shown in Figure 9-6.

230
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

6. Type the text corresponding to the next number or bullet, and then
press Enter at the end of the paragraph to move to the next line.
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for each subsequent numbered or bulleted
item.
For legibility, you sometimes want to add spaces between the notes. If you
press Enter twice to give yourself a blank line, AutoCAD — like every good
word processor — thinks you’re finished with your list and turns number-
ing off. AutoCAD is smart, so you need to be smarter. If you put the cursor
at the end of the first note and press Enter, you get a blank line. The prob-
lem is, the blank line is now numbered, and your intended Note 2 is now
Note 3. Just press the Backspace key. The number on the blank line disap-
pears, and Note 2 is back to being Note 2 again. When you delete a num-
bered item, the remaining numbers automatically adjust.
If you don’t like the horizontal spacing of the numbers or the alignment
of subsequent lines, you can adjust them easily by manipulating the tab
and indent markers in the Multiline Text Editor’s ruler, as described in
the next step.
8. In the ruler, drag the upper slider (the triangle pointing down) to the
right a short distance. Drag the lower slider (the triangle pointing up)
to the right a slightly greater distance.
The upper slider controls the indentation of the first line in each para-
graph. The lower slider controls the indentation of the second and sub-
sequent lines. An indent of one to two of the short, vertical tick marks
usually works well for the first line. An indent of two to four tick marks
works well for the second and subsequent lines.
9. Click in the ruler just above the lower slider.
A small triangle (pointing right) appears above the lower slider. This tri-
angle shows the tab stop.
Make sure that the corner of the tab stop (right-pointing) triangle aligns
horizontally with the point of the lower slider triangle. If not, click and
drag the tab stop until it aligns. 
If you prefer to type tab and indent distances, not adjust them with the cursor,
use the Indents and Tabs choice on the mText right-click menu. Whichever
way you do it, if you select text first, the tab and indent changes apply to the
selected text. If you don’t select text first, the changes apply to new text from
that point in the multiline text object forward.
AutoCAD’s multiline text feature has come a long, long way since its introduc-
tion over a decade ago. Even so, remember the old adage about using the
right tool for the right job. It’s possible to make a drawing in your favorite
word processor, but AutoCAD is probably a better tool. Likewise, if you’re
contemplating adding pages of text or fancy text formatting to a drawing,
consider putting the text in a separate word processing document instead.
231
Chapter 9: Text with Character

If you absolutely must place the text from a long document on a drawing (on
a general notes sheet, for example), you’ll have to break it up into several
columns, each of which is a separate mText object. Get the text right in a
word processor first and then copy and paste it into AutoCAD.
If you’re tempted to circumvent our warning by pasting a word processing
document directly into an AutoCAD drawing, please read Chapter 17 first.
An alternative to pasting parts or all of a word-processor document is to save
the word-processed text in RTF format and then import it into the Multiline
Text Editor. See Chapter 18 for more information on this technique.
Modifying mText
After you create a multiline text object, you edit it like a single-line text
object: Select the object, right-click, and choose Mtext Edit or Properties.
 The Mtext Edit option opens the Multiline Text Editor window so that
you can change the text contents and formatting.
 The Properties option opens the Properties palette, where you can
change overall properties for the text object.
The easiest way to change the word-wrapping width of a paragraph text
object is to grip edit it. Select the text object, click one of the corner grips,
release the mouse button, move the cursor, and click again. Chapter 7
describes grip editing in detail.
AutoCAD includes two text modification commands that may be useful to you
when you become an AutoCAD textpert. SCALETEXT scales a group of text
objects, similar to the SCale command. The difference is that SCALETEXT
scales each text object around its own base point, whereas SCale uses a
single base point for scaling all objects. SCALETEXT is especially useful when
you have to change the scale of a drawing. JUSTIFYTEXT changes the justifi-
cation of one or more text strings without causing the text to move. Both of
these commands are available on the Modify➪Object➪Text submenu.
Gather ‘Round the Tables
Tables were a new feature in AutoCAD 2005. You don’t know the meaning of
the word “tedious” unless you’ve tried to create a column-and-row data table
in older versions of AutoCAD with the Line and TEXT commands. AutoCAD’s
table object and the TableStyle and TaBle commands for creating it make the
job almost fun.
232
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Tables have style, too
You control the appearance of tables — both the text and the gridlines —
with table styles (just as you control the appearance of standalone text with
text styles). Use the TableStyle command to create and modify table styles.
Follow these steps to create a table:
1. Choose Format➪Table Style.
The Table Style dialog box appears.
2. In the Styles list, select the existing table style whose settings you
want to use as the starting point for the settings of your new style.
For example, select the default table style named Standard.
3. Click the New button to create a new table style that’s a copy of the
existing style.
The Create New Table Style dialog box appears.
4. Enter a New Style Name and click Continue.
The New Table Style dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-7.
5. On the Data tab, specify settings for the data text and gridlines (that
is, for all cells except the column heads and the table title).
The settings you are likely to want to change are Text Style, Text Height,
and perhaps either Text Color or Grid Color. (If you leave colors set to
ByBlock, then the text and grid lines will inherit the color that’s current
Figure 9-7:
Setting the
table.
233
Chapter 9: Text with Character

when you create the table. That color will be the current layer’s color,
if you follow our advice in the “Accumulating properties” section of
Chapter 5.)
6. Repeat Step 5 for the Column Heads tab and the Title tab.
7. Click OK to close the New Table Style dialog box.
The Table Style dialog box reappears.
8. (Optional) Select your new table style from the Styles list, and then
click Set Current.
Your new table style becomes the current table style that AutoCAD uses
for future tables in this drawing.
9. Click Close.
The Table Style dialog box closes. Now you’re ready to create a table, as
described in the next section.
AutoCAD stores table styles in the DWG file, so a style that you create in one
drawing isn’t immediately available in others. You can copy a table style from
one drawing to another with DesignCenter. (Use the “Borrowing existing
dimension styles” procedure in Chapter 10, but substitute Table Styles for
DimStyles.)
Creating and editing tables
After you create a suitable table style, adding a table to your drawing is easy
with the TaBle command. Here’s how:
1. Set an appropriate layer current.
Assuming that you leave the current color, linetype, and lineweight set
to ByLayer, as we recommend in Chapter 5, the current layer’s proper-
ties will control the properties of any parts of the table that you left set
to ByBlock when you defined the table style. (See Step 5 in the preceding
section, “Tables have style, too.”)
2. Choose Draw➪Table.
The Insert Table dialog box appears.
3. Choose a table style from the Table Style Name drop-down list.
4. Choose an Insertion Behavior.
Specify Insertion Point is the easiest method and means that you’ll pick
the location of the table’s upper-left corner (or lower-left corner if you
set Table Direction to Up in the table style). With this method, you spec-
ify the default column width and number of rows in the Insert Table
dialog box.
234
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Specify Window means that you’ll pick the upper-left corner and then
the lower-right corner. With this method, AutoCAD automatically scales
the column widths and determines how many rows to include. 
5. Specify Column & Row Settings.
If you chose Specify Window in Step 4, AutoCAD sets the Column Width
and number of Data Rows to Auto, which means that AutoCAD will figure
them out based on the overall size of the table that you specify in Steps 7
and 8.
6. Click OK.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the insertion point of the table.
7. Click a point or type coordinates.
If you chose Specify Insertion Point in Step 4, AutoCAD draws the table
grid lines, places the cursor in the title cell, and displays the Text
Formatting toolbar.
8. If you chose Specify Window in Step 4, specify the diagonally opposite
corner of the table.
AutoCAD draws the table. Based on the table size that you indicated,
AutoCAD chooses the column width and number of rows.
9. Type a title for the table.
10. Press the arrow keys or tab key to move among cells, and type values
in each cell.
The cell right-click menu offers many other options, including copying
contents from one cell to another, merging cells, inserting rows and
columns, changing formatting, and inserting a block (that is, a graphical
symbol — see Chapter 13 for information about blocks).
The fields feature described earlier in this chapter works for table text,
too — you can insert a field into a table cell. For example, you might
use this feature to create part of a title block, with fields serving as the
“date” and “drawn by” data.
11. Click OK on the Text Formatting toolbar.
Figure 9-8 shows a completed table, along with the Insert Table dialog box.
You can edit cell values later simply by double-clicking in a cell. To change
column width or row height, click on the table grid and then click and move
the blue grips. (To change the width of one column without altering the over-
all width of the table, hold down the Ctrl key while you move the grip.) If you
want to change other aspects of a table or individual cells in it, select the
table or cell and use the Properties palette to make changes.
235
Chapter 9: Text with Character

You can import tables from Microsoft Excel instead of using the Insert Table
dialog box. To import Excel data, in Excel, select the desired cells and choose
Edit➪Copy. Then in AutoCAD, choose Edit➪Paste Special and choose AutoCAD
Entities in the Paste Special dialog box. AutoCAD attempts to copy the Excel
spreadsheet’s formatting along with the cell data, but you’ll probably have to
adjust column widths and perform other cleanup on the imported table.
You can go the other direction — from AutoCAD to Excel or another
program — via a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file. Look up “TABLEEXPORT
command” in AutoCAD’s online help.
In AutoCAD 2006, you can extract attribute data to tables. See Chapter 13 for
information about blocks and attributes. You can also perform simple calcu-
lations in tables, using predefined functions or your own arithmetical expres-
sions. Look up “Use Formulas in Table Cells” in AutoCAD’s online help.
Checking Out Your Spelling
AutoCAD, like almost every other computer program on this planet — and
possibly on other planets and moons in our solar system — has a spelling
checker.
Figure 9-8:
The Insert
Table dialog
box, and the
result of
using it.
236
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Unlike Microsoft Word, AutoCAD’s spelling checker doesn’t make those little
red squiggles under your errors, but it does let you search for spelling errors
in most of the text objects in your drawing. This feature checks single-line
text, paragraph text, and attribute text (described in Chapter 13), but not
dimension text (described in Chapter 10). The following procedure demon-
strates how to use the spell checker:
1. Press the Esc key to deselect any selected objects.
2. Choose Tools➪Spelling to start the SPell command.
This is text spell checking, not casting a spell. (That’s the EYEOFNEWT
command.) The command line prompts you to select objects.
3. Select the objects you want to check.
You can use any of the standard AutoCAD object selection methods to
select text to check. (See Chapter 7 if you’re unfamiliar with object selec-
tion.) Type ALL and press Enter if you want to check the spelling of all
text in the drawing. Don’t worry if you select objects other than text; the
spelling checker ignores any objects that aren’t text. When you’re fin-
ished selecting objects, press Enter to start the spelling check.
If a misspelling is found, the Check Spelling dialog box appears with the
first misspelled or unrecognized word. Figure 9-9 shows an example.
4. Click the dialog box buttons to tell AutoCAD how to handle a 
misspelling.
You probably know which buttons to click from having used other spelling
checkers. If not, use the dialog box help to find out: Click the question
mark on the Check Spelling dialog box’s title bar, and then click the button
that you want to know more about.

Chapter 9: Text with Character

AutoCAD continues with spell checking until it has checked all the
selected text objects. When it finds no further misspellings, the dialog
box disappears, and the Spelling check complete alert appears.
Every industry has its own abbreviations and specialized vocabulary. At first,
AutoCAD complains about perfectly good words (from a drafter’s point of
view) such as thru and S.A.D. (which stands for See Architectural Drawing).
Be prepared to click the Add button frequently during the first few weeks to
tell AutoCAD which words and abbreviations are acceptable in your industry
and office. If you’re patient with it, AutoCAD, like an errant puppy, will gradu-
ally become more obedient. Then you’ll be thru feeling S.A.D.

n drafting — either CAD or manual drafting — dimensions are special text
labels with attached lines that together indicate unambiguously the size of
something. Although it’s theoretically possible to draw all the pieces of each
dimension by using AutoCAD commands such as Line and mText, dimension-
ing is so common a drafting task that AutoCAD provides special commands
for doing the job more efficiently. These dimensioning commands group the
parts of each dimension into a convenient, easy-to-edit package. Even better,
as you edit an object — by stretching it for example — AutoCAD automati-
cally updates the measurement displayed in the dimension text label to indi-
cate the object’s new size, as shown in Figure 10-1.
AutoCAD controls the look of dimensions by means of dimension styles, just
as it controls the look of text with text styles. (AutoCAD also uses text styles
to control the appearance of the text in dimensions.) But dimension styles
are much more complicated than text styles, because dimensions have so
many more pieces that you need to control. After you find or create an appro-
priate dimension style, you use one of several dimensioning commands to
draw dimensions that point to the important points on an object (the two
endpoints of a line, for example).

AutoCAD dimensioning is a big, complicated subject. (It’s so complicated, in
fact, that Autodesk has an especially wise person in charge of dimensioning
in AutoCAD — this person is called the “DimWit.”) Every industry has its own
dimensioning conventions, habits, and quirks. As usual, AutoCAD tries to
support them all and, in so doing, makes things a bit convoluted for every-
one. This chapter covers the essential concepts and commands that you
need to know to start drawing dimensions. Be prepared to spend some addi-
tional time studying how to create any specialized types of dimensions that
your industry uses.
You may be able to avoid getting too deeply into the details of dimensioning
just by copying dimension styles from existing drawings in your office. (We
show you how later in this chapter.) This may also be a good time to get some
advice and coaching from the AutoCAD geek in the cubicle across from yours.
You add dimensions to a drawing after you’ve drawn at least some of the
geometry; otherwise, you won’t have much to dimension! Your dimensioning
and overall drafting efficiency improve if you add dimensions in batches,
rather than draw a line, draw a dimension, draw another line, draw another
dimension. . . .

Discovering New Dimensions
Before digging into the techniques that you use to create dimension styles and
dimensions, we review some AutoCAD dimensioning terminology. If you’re
already familiar with CAD dimensioning lingo, just skim this section and look
at the figures in it. Otherwise, read on.
Anatomy of a dimension
AutoCAD uses the names shown in Figure 10-2 and described in the following
list to refer to the parts of each dimension:
241
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions
Why dimensions in CAD?
You may think that CAD would have rendered
text dimensions obsolete. After all, you comply
with all our suggestions about using AutoCAD
precision techniques when you draw and edit,
and you’re careful to draw each object at its
true size, right? The contractor or machinist can
just use AutoCAD to query distances and angles
in the CAD DWG file, right? Sorry, but no (to the
last question, anyway). Here are a few reasons
why the traditional dimensioning that CAD draft-
ing has inherited from manual drafting is likely
to be around for a while:
 Some people need to or want to use paper
drawings when they build something.
We’re still some time away from the day
when contractors haul computers around on
their tool belts (never mind mousing around
a drawing while hanging from scaffolding).
 In many industries, paper drawings still
rule legally. Your company may supply both
plotted drawings and DWG files to clients,
but your contracts probably specify that 
the plotted drawings govern in the case 
of any discrepancy. The contracts proba-
bly also warn against relying on any dis-
tances that the recipient of the drawings
measures — using measuring commands
in the CAD DWG file or a scale on the plot-
ted drawing. The text dimensions are sup-
posed to supply all the dimensional
information that’s needed to construct the
object.
 Dimensions sometimes carry additional
information besides the basic length or
angle. For example, dimension text can 
indicate the allowable construction toler-
ances or show that a particular distance is
typical of similar situations elsewhere on
the drawing.
 Even conscientious CAD drafters rarely
draw every object its true size. Drafters
sometimes exaggerate distances for graph-
ical clarity. For example, they might draw a
small object larger than its true size so that
it shows up clearly on a scaled plot. In addi-
tion, drafters sometimes settle for approxi-
mate distances because time pressures
(especially late in a project) make it difficult
to be completely accurate.
So remember the old rule of drafting prowess:
“It’s not the size of the drawn object that mat-
ters, but the dimensions that are on it.”

 Dimension text: Dimension text usually is the number that indicates
the actual distance or angle. Dimension text can also include other text
information in addition to or instead of the number. For example, you
can add a suffix such as TYP. to indicate that a dimension is typical of
several similar configurations, or you can insert a description such as
See Detail 3/A2.
 Dimension lines: The dimension lines go from the dimension text out-
ward (parallel to the direction of the object being measured), to indicate
the extent of the dimensioned length. AutoCAD’s default dimension style
settings center the dimension text vertically and horizontally on the
dimension lines (see Figure 10-2), but you can change those settings to
cause the text to appear in a different location — riding above an unbro-
ken dimension line as shown in Figure 10-1, for example. See the section
“Adjusting style settings,” later in this chapter, for instructions.
 Dimension arrowheads: The dimension arrowheads appear at the ends
of the dimension lines and clarify the extent of the dimensioned length.
AutoCAD’s default arrowhead style is the closed, filled type shown in
Figure 10-2, but you can choose other symbols, such as tick marks, to
indicate the ends of the dimension lines. (Don’t get ticked off, but
AutoCAD calls the line ending an arrowhead even when, as in the case
of a tick mark, it doesn’t look like an arrow.)
 Extension lines: The extension lines extend outward from the extension
line origin points that you select (usually by snapping to points on an
object) to the dimension lines. By drafting convention, a small gap usu-
ally exists between the extension line origin points and the beginning of
the extension lines. The extension lines usually extend just beyond
where they meet the dimension lines.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

AutoCAD 2006 adds two enhancements to dimension extension lines. You can
make a set of dimensions look tidier by assigning fixed lengths for the exten-
sion lines. And if you need to dimension to circles or centerlines, you can
assign dash-dot linetypes to either or both extension lines. For more informa-
tion, refer to the online help system.
A field guide to dimensions
AutoCAD provides several types of dimensions and commands for drawing
them. Figure 10-3 shows the most common types, and the following list
describes them:
 Linear dimensions: A linear dimension measures the linear extent of an
object or the linear distance between objects. Most linear dimensions
are either horizontal or vertical, but you can draw dimensions that are
rotated to other angles, too. An aligned dimension is similar to a linear
dimension, but the dimension line tilts to the same angle as a line drawn
through the origin points of its extension lines.
 Radial dimensions: A radius dimension calls out the radius of a circle or
arc, and a diameter dimension calls out the diameter of a circle or arc. You
can position the dimension text inside or outside the curve, as shown in
Figure 10-3. If you position the text outside the curve, AutoCAD by default
draws a little cross at the center of the circle or arc.
 Angular dimensions: An angular dimension calls out the angular mea-
surement between two lines, the two endpoints of an arc, or two points
on a circle. The dimension line appears as an arc that indicates the
sweep of the measured angle.

Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

AutoCAD 2006’s new DIMARC command dimensions arc lengths (see Figure
10-10 later in this chapter for an example). Make sure your industry or office
standards agree with this type of dimensioning — the standard way of dimen-
sioning arcs is with a radius dimension like the one in Figure 10-3.
Other types of AutoCAD dimensions include ordinate, tolerance, center mark,
and leader dimensions. See the “Pointy-Headed Leaders” section at the end of
this chapter for instructions on how to draw leaders. Look up “dimensions,
creating” on the Index tab in the AutoCAD online help system for more infor-
mation about other kinds of dimensions.
Dimension associativity
By default, AutoCAD groups all the parts of each dimension — the extension
lines, dimension lines, arrowheads, and text — into a special associative
dimension object. Associative means two things:
 The different parts of the dimension function as a single object. When
you click any part of the dimension, AutoCAD selects all of its parts.
 The dimension is connected with the points on the object that you speci-
fied when you drew the dimension. If you change the size of the object
(for example, stretch a line), the dimension updates appropriately — the
lines and arrows move, and the text changes to reflect the line’s new size.
The associative dimensions we’re talking about here first appeared in
AutoCAD 2002. Before that, AutoCAD had a more primitive kind of dimension-
ing. Dimensions were single objects, and they did update if you stretched an
object while being very careful to include the dimension itself in the crossing
selection for the Stretch command. Here’s where things can get a bit confus-
ing: AutoCAD used to call these old-style single-object dimensions associa-
tive, but now calls them non-associative. It doesn’t stop there either; what
used to be called non-associative dimensions before AutoCAD 2002 are now
called exploded dimensions. For more information about how to determine
which kind of dimension AutoCAD draws, see the “Controlling and editing
dimension associativity” section, later in this chapter.
Pulling out your dimension tools
The AutoCAD Dimension menu provides access to dimensioning commands. If
you find yourself adding dimensions in batches, the Dimension toolbar is more
efficient because it makes the dimensioning commands more accessible. You
toggle the Dimension toolbar off and on by right-clicking any AutoCAD toolbar
icon and choosing Dimension from the menu. As with other toolbars, you can
move the Dimension toolbar to a different location on the screen or dock it on
any margin of the drawing area.
244
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

All dimensioning commands have long command names (such as DIMARC,
DIMLINEAR, and DIMRADIUS) and corresponding shortened abbreviations
(DAR, DLI, and DRA) that you can type at the command prompt. If you do lots
of dimensioning and don’t want to toggle the Dimension toolbar on and off
repeatedly, memorize the abbreviated forms of the dimension commands
that you use frequently. You’ll find a list of the long command names on
the Contents tab in the AutoCAD online help system. Choose Command
Reference➪Commands➪D Commands. The short names are usually the first,
fourth, and fifth letters of the long names. (In other words, take the first five
letters of the long name and remove IM.)
Doing Dimensions with Style(s)
Creating a usable dimension style that gives you the dimension look you
want is the biggest challenge in using AutoCAD’s dimensioning features. Each
drawing contains its own dimension styles, so changes you make to a dimen-
sion style in one drawing affect only that drawing. However, after you get the
dimension styles right in a drawing, you can use it as a template or starting
point for later drawings.
A dimension style is a collection of drawing settings called dimension vari-
ables, which are a special class of the system variables that we introduce in
Chapter 2.
If you want to see a list of the dimension variable names and look up what each
variable controls, see Contents➪Command Reference➪System Variables➪D
System Variables in the AutoCAD online help system. All the system variables
that begin with DIM are dimension variables.
AutoCAD users, like all computer nerds, like to shorten names. You may hear
them refer to dimstyles and dimvars instead of dimension styles and dimen-
sion variables. You can tell them that doing so makes you think of them as
dimwits — which is actually an honorable title at Autodesk, as we mention
earlier in this chapter.
Borrowing existing dimension styles
If you’re lucky enough to work in an office where someone has set up dimen-
sion styles that are appropriate for your industry and project, you can skip
the pain and strain of creating your own dimension styles. If the ready-made
dimension style that you need lives in another drawing, you can use the
DesignCenter palette to copy it into your drawing, as described in the follow-
ing steps:
245
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

1. Open the drawing that contains the dimension style you want to copy
(the source drawing).
2. Open the drawing to which you want to copy the dimension style (the
destination drawing).
If you already had both drawings open, make sure that you can see the
destination drawing. If you can’t, choose the Window menu and then
choose the destination drawing in order to bring it to the foreground.
3. Click the AutoCAD DesignCenter button on the Standard toolbar.
The DesignCenter palette appears. (Chapter 5 describes this palette in
detail.)
4. In the DesignCenter palette, click the Open Drawings tab.
DesignCenter’s navigation pane displays a list of drawings that you cur-
rently have open in AutoCAD.
5. In the left pane of the DesignCenter palette, click the plus sign next to
the name of the drawing that you opened in Step 1.
A list of copyable objects, including Dimstyles, appears.
6. Click and drag the desired dimension style from the right pane of the
DesignCenter palette into the window containing the drawing that you
opened in Step 2, as shown in Figure 10-4.
If the name of the dimension style that you copy duplicates the name of
an existing dimension style in the destination drawing, AutoCAD refuses
to overwrite the existing dimension style. In that case, you must first
rename the existing dimension style in the destination drawing by using
the information in the following section, “Creating and managing dimen-
sion styles.”
7. Change the Use Overall Scale Of factor on the Fit tab of the Modify
Dimension Style dialog box so that it matches the drawing scale factor
of the current drawing.
See Chapter 4 for detailed instructions on calculating and setting the
scale factor.
If you want a dimension style to be available in new drawings, copy the style
to a template drawing and use that template to create your new drawings.
See Chapter 4 for more information about template drawings.
Creating and managing dimension styles
If you do need to create your own dimension styles, or you want to tweak
ones that you copied from another drawing, you use the Dimension Style
Manager dialog box, shown in Figure 10-5.

Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

Every drawing comes with a default dimension style named Standard (for impe-
rial [feet and inches] drawings) or ISO-25 (for metric drawings). Although you
can use and modify the Standard or ISO-25 style, we suggest that you leave it as
is and create your own dimension style(s) for the settings that are appropriate
to your work. This approach ensures that you can use the default style as a ref-
erence. More important, it avoids a potential naming conflict that can change
the way your dimensions look if the current drawing gets inserted into another
drawing. (Chapter 13 describes this potential conflict.)
The following steps describe how to create your own dimension style(s):
1. Choose Format➪Dimension Style, or click the Dimension Style Manager
button on the Styles toolbar.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box appears.
2. In the Styles list, select the existing dimension style whose settings
you want to use as the starting point for the settings of your new style.
For example, select the default dimension style named Standard or 
ISO-25.
3. Click the New button to create a new dimension style that’s a copy of
the existing style.
The Create New Dimension Style dialog box appears.
4. Enter a New Style Name and click Continue.
The New Dimension Style dialog box appears. (This dialog box is virtually
identical to the Modify Dimension Style dialog box shown in Figure 10-6 in
the following section.)
5. Modify dimension settings on any of the seven tabs in the New
Dimension Style dialog box.
See the descriptions of these settings in the next section of this chapter.
In particular, be sure to set the Use Overall Scale Of factor on the Fit tab
to set the drawing scale factor.
6. Click OK to close the New Dimension Style dialog box.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box reappears.
7. Select your new dimension style from the Styles list, and then click Set
Current.
Your new dimension style becomes the current dimension style that
AutoCAD uses for future dimensions in this drawing.
8. Click Close.
The Dimension Style Manager dialog box closes.
9. Draw some dimensions to test your new dimension style.
248
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Avoid changing existing dimension styles that you didn’t create, unless you
know for sure what they’re used for. When you change a dimension style set-
ting, all dimensions that use that style change to reflect the revised setting.
Thus, one small dimension variable setting change can affect a large number
of existing dimensions! When in doubt, ask the dimension style’s creator what
the dimension style is for and what the consequences of changing it are. If
that’s not possible, instead of modifying an existing dimension style, create a
new style by copying the existing one and modifying the new one.
A further variation on the already baroque dimension style picture is that you
can create dimension secondary styles (also called substyles or style families) —
variations of a main style that affect only a particular type of dimension, such
as radial or angular. You probably want to avoid this additional complication
if you can, but if you open the Dimension Style Manager dialog box and see
names of dimension types indented beneath the main dimension style names,
be aware that you’re dealing with secondary styles. Look up “dimension styles,
creating, Create New Dimension Style Dialog Box” on the Index tab in the
AutoCAD online help system for more information.
Adjusting style settings
After you click New or Modify in the Dimension Style Manager dialog box,
AutoCAD displays a tabbed New/Modify Dimension Style subdialog box with
a mind-boggling — and potentially drawing-boggling, if you’re not careful —
array of settings. Figure 10-6 shows the settings on the first tab, which
we’ve modified from the AutoCAD defaults to conform to one office’s drafting
standards.
Figure 10-6:
Modifying
dimension
settings.
249
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

Fortunately, the dimension preview that appears on all tabs — as well as on
the main Dimension Style Manager dialog box — immediately shows the
results of most setting changes. With the dimension preview and some trial-
and-error changing of settings, you usually can home in on an acceptable
group of settings. For more information, use the dialog box help: Click the
question mark button on the title bar and then click the setting that you want
to know more about.
Before you start messing with dimension style settings, it’s important to
know what you want your dimensions to look like when they’re plotted. If
you’re not sure how it’s done in your industry, ask others in your office or
profession or look at a plotted drawing that someone in the know represents
as being a good example.
The following sections introduce you to the more important New/Modify
Dimension Style tabs and highlight useful settings. Note that whenever you
specify a distance or length setting, you should enter the desired plotted size.
AutoCAD scales all these numbers by the overall scale factor that you enter
on the Fit tab.
Following Lines and Arrows
The settings on the Lines and the Symbols and Arrows tabs control the basic
look and feel of all parts of your dimensions except text. Use these tabs to
change the type and size of arrowheads or the display characteristics of the
dimension and extension lines.
Tabbing to Text
Use the Text tab to control how your dimension text looks — the text style
and height to use (see Chapter 9) and where to place the text with respect to
the dimension and extension lines. You’ll probably want to change the Text
Style setting to something that uses a more pleasing font than the dorky
default Txt.shx font, such as the Romans.shx font. The default Text Height is
too large for most situations — set it to 1⁄8", 3mm, or another height that makes
sense. Figure 10-7 shows one company’s standard text settings.
You must define the text style that you specify for a dimension style with a
height of zero in the Text Style dialog box. (See Chapter 9 for more informa-
tion about variable height and fixed height text styles.) If you specify a fixed
height text style for a dimension style, the text style’s height will override the
Text Height setting in the New/Modify Dimension Style subdialog box. This
behavior is confusing at best and unacceptable at worst. Use a zero-height
style to avoid the problem.
Enter the desired plotted text height. Don’t multiply it by the drawing scale
factor, as you do for ordinary text.
250
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Industry or company standards usually dictate the size of dimension text.
(For example, 1⁄8 inch is common in the architectural industry.) In any case,
make sure you pick a height that’s not too small to read on your smallest
check plot.
Getting Fit
The Fit tab includes a bunch of confusing options that control when and where
AutoCAD shoves the dimension text if it doesn’t quite fit between the dimen-
sion lines. The default settings leave AutoCAD in “maximum attempt at being
helpful mode” — that is, AutoCAD moves the text, dimension lines, and arrows
around automatically so that things don’t overlap. If these guesses seem less
than satisfactory to you, try the modified settings shown in Figure 10-8: Select
the Over Dimension Line, Without Leader radio button under Text Placement
and the Draw Dim Line between Ext Lines check box under Fine Tuning. (You
can always move the text yourself by grip editing it, as we describe later in this
chapter.)
Even at its most helpful, AutoCAD sometimes makes a bad guess about how
you want your dimension text and arrows arranged. In AutoCAD 2006, you
can flip your dimension arrows to the other side of the extension lines. If
you’re having problems getting the look you want, don’t flip your wig — flip
your arrows by selecting the dimension, right-clicking, and choosing Flip
Arrow from the shortcut menu. 
Most important, the Fit tab includes the Use Overall Scale Of setting, as
shown in Figure 10-8. This setting acts as a global scaling factor for all the
other length-related dimension settings. 
Figure 10-7:
Whip your
dimension
text into

251
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

If your drawing includes areas of different scales, you can create multiple
dimension styles, one for each scale. Alternatively, you can select the Scale
Dimensions to Layout radio button and draw dimensions in a paper space
layout, rather than in model space. See the “Trans-spatial dimensioning” sec-
tion, later in this chapter, for more information.
The Use Overall Scale Of setting corresponds to the DIMSCALE system vari-
able, and you’ll hear AutoCAD drafters refer to it as such. AutoCAD accepts
zero as a special DIMSCALE setting for dimensioning in paper space layouts.
Look up the DIMSCALE system variable in the AutoCAD online help system
for more information about additional dimension scale options.
Using Primary Units
The Primary Units tab gives you incredibly — or maybe overly — detailed con-
trol over how AutoCAD formats the characters in the dimension text string.
You usually want to set the Unit format and Precision and maybe specify a
suffix for unit-less numbers, such as mm for millimeters. You may also change
the Zero Suppression settings, depending on whether you want dimension text
to read 0.5000, .5000, or 0.5. (“Zero Suppression!” also makes a great rallying
cry for organizing your fellow AutoCAD drafters.)
Other style settings
If your work requires that you show dimensions in two different units (such
as inches and millimeters), use the Alternate Units tab to turn on and control
Drawing scale factor goes here
Figure 10-8:
Keep Fit and
don’t forget
the Scale.
252
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

alternate units. If your work requires listing construction tolerances (for exam-
ple, 3.5 +/–0.01), use the Tolerances tab to configure the tolerance format that
you want.
The New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box Tolerance tab settings are for
adding manufacturing tolerances (for example, +0.2 or -0.1) to the text of
ordinary dimensions — the kind of dimensions we cover in this chapter.
AutoCAD also includes a separate TOLERANCES command that draws special
symbols called geometric tolerances. If you need these symbols, you probably
know it; if you’ve never heard of them, just ignore them. Look up “Geometric
Tolerance dialog box” on the Index tab in the AutoCAD online help system for
more information.
Drawing Dimensions
After you’ve copied or created a suitable dimension style, you’re ready to
dimension. Fortunately, adding dimensions to a drawing with existing dimen-
sion styles is usually pretty straightforward.
When you want to dimension something in AutoCAD, you can either select
the object, such as a line or polyline segment, or select points on that object,
such as the endpoints of the line or polyline segment. If you select an object,
AutoCAD finds the most obvious points on it to dimension, such as the end-
points of a line. If you choose to select individual points instead, use object
snaps (see Chapter 5). The points that you pick — or that AutoCAD finds for
you — are called the origins of the dimension’s extension lines. When you
change the size of the object (for example, by stretching it), AutoCAD auto-
matically moves the dimension’s origin points and updates the dimension
text to show the new length.
If you don’t use object snaps or another AutoCAD precision technique to
choose dimension points, the dimension text probably won’t reflect the pre-
cise measurement of the object. This lack of precision can cause serious
problems. When in doubt, osnap to it!
When you set up a new drawing, make sure that you change the Use Overall
Scale Of setting on the Fit tab in the New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box
(refer to Figure 10-6) so that it matches the drawing scale factor. Before you
draw any dimensions in a drawing that you didn’t set up, check this setting to
make sure it’s correct.
The AutoCAD dimensioning commands prompt you with useful information
at the command line. Read the command line prompts during every step of
the command, especially when you’re trying a dimensioning command for
the first time.
253
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

Lining up some linear dimensions
Linear dimensions are the most common type of dimensions, and horizontal
and vertical are the most common of those. The following example demon-
strates all the important techniques for creating horizontal and vertical
linear dimensions, as well as aligned dimensions (which are similar to linear
dimensions):
1. Use the LINE command to draw a nonorthogonal line —, that is, a line
segment that’s not horizontal or vertical.
An angle of about 30 degrees works well for this example.
If you want to apply dimensioning to an object other than a line, use
these steps as a general guideline, filling in the appropriate commands
and data as applicable to your drawing.
2. Set a layer that’s appropriate for dimensions as current.
See Chapter 5 for details on setting a layer as current.
3. Set a dimension style that’s appropriate for your needs as current.
Choose an existing dimension style from the Dim Style Control drop-
down list on the Styles toolbar, or create a new style by using the proce-
dure in the section “Creating and managing dimension styles,” earlier in
this chapter.
4. Choose Dimension➪Linear or click the Linear Dimension button on
the Dimension toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify first extension line origin or <select object>:
5. To specify the origin of the first extension line, snap to the lower-left
endpoint of the line by using endpoint object snap.
If you don’t have endpoint as one of your current running object snaps,
specify a single endpoint object snap by holding down the Shift key,
right-clicking, and choosing Endpoint from the menu. (See Chapter 5 for
more about object snaps.)
AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify second extension line origin:
6. To specify the origin of the second extension line, snap to the other
endpoint of the line by using endpoint object snap again.
AutoCAD draws a horizontal dimension — the length of the displace-
ment in the left-to-right direction — if you move the cursor above or
below the line. It draws a vertical dimension — the length of the dis-
placement in the up-and-down direction — if you move the cursor to
the left or right of the line.
254
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify dimension line location or
[Mtext/Text/Angle/Horizontal/Vertical/Rotated]: 
7. Move the mouse to generate the type of dimension you want, horizon-
tal or vertical, and then click wherever you want to place the dimen-
sion line.
When you’re specifying the dimension line location, you usually don’t
want to object snap to existing objects — you want the dimension line
and text to sit in a relatively empty part of the drawing rather than bump
into existing objects. If necessary, temporarily turn off running object
snap (for example, click the OSNAP button on the status bar) in order to
avoid snapping the dimension line to an existing object.
AutoCAD draws the dimension.
If you want to be able to align subsequent dimension lines easily, turn on
Snap and set a suitable snap spacing — more easily done than said! —
before you pick the point that determines the location of the dimension
line. See Chapter 4 for more information about snap.
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 to create another linear dimension of the
opposite orientation (vertical or horizontal).
9. Choose Dimension➪Aligned or click the Aligned Dimension button on
the Dimension toolbar.
The prompt includes an option to select an object instead of picking
two points (you can use this technique with the Linear Dimension com-
mand, too):
Specify first extension line origin or <select object>:
10. Press Enter to choose the select object option.
AutoCAD prompts you:
Select object to dimension:
11. Select the line or other object that you want to dimension.
AutoCAD automatically finds the endpoints of the line and uses them as
the extension line origin points, as shown in Figure 10-9.
AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify dimension line location or
[Mtext/Text/Angle]:
12. Click wherever you want to place the dimension line.
AutoCAD draws the dimension.

Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

Drawing other kinds of dimensions
After you have the hang of ordinary linear dimensions, you should be able to
master other common dimension types quickly. Draw some lines, arcs, and
circles, and try the other dimension commands on the Dimension toolbar or
menu.
To draw a series of side-by-side dimensions whose dimension lines are per-
fectly aligned, use the DimCOntinue command. To draw an overall dimension
above one or more smaller dimensions, use DimBAseline. If you use these
commands often in your work, you may find that the QDIM (Quick DIMension)
command provides a quick way to draw lots of dimensions in one fell swoop.
Figure 10-10 shows some results of using the more common additional dimen-
sioning commands.

Trans-spatial dimensioning
Trans-spatial dimensioning may sound like the latest New Age fad — after all,
most of Autodesk’s programmers do work in California — but actually it’s just
a relatively new (circa AutoCAD 2002) dimensioning feature. There’s an age-
old argument about whether to draw dimensions in model space, where the
geometry that you’re dimensioning usually resides, or paper space. (See
Chapter 4 for information about model space and paper space.) Many people
have settled on dimensioning in model space, but sometimes dimensioning in
paper space offers advantages — for example, when you want to dimension
different parts of the same geometry in different paper space viewports.
Since AutoCAD 2002, the program works much better for dimensioning in
paper space layouts — when you set the DIMSCALE system variable to 1.0
and then draw dimensions in paper space, AutoCAD can associate them with
objects in model space.
Get comfortable with dimensioning in model space first. If you later want to
try dimensioning in paper space, look up “dimensioning, methods” in the
AutoCAD online help system.

Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

Editing Dimensions
After you draw dimensions, you can edit the position of the various parts of
each dimension and change the contents of the dimension text. AutoCAD
groups all the parts of a dimension into a single object.
Editing dimension geometry
The easiest way to change the location of dimension parts is to use grip edit-
ing, which we describe in Chapter 7. Just click a dimension, click one of its
grips, and maneuver away. You’ll discover that certain grips control certain
directions of movement. Experiment a few minutes to see how they work.
If you want to change the look of a dimension part (for example, substitute a
different arrowhead or suppress an extension line), use the Properties
palette. (See Chapter 7 for more on the Properties palette.) All the dimension
settings in the New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box (see “Adjusting style
settings,” earlier in this chapter) are available in the Properties palette when
you select one or more dimensions.
If you select one or more dimensions and right-click, the menu displays a
number of useful options for overriding dimension settings or assigning a dif-
ferent style.
When you change a setting in the Properties palette, you’re overriding the
default style setting for that dimension. If you need to make the same change to
a bunch of dimensions, it’s better to create a new dimension style and assign
that style to them. You can use the Properties palette or the right-click menu to
change the dimension style that’s assigned to one or more dimensions.
You can use the Properties palette to turn on AutoCAD’s background mask
feature, described in Chapter 9, for the text of individual dimensions: Select
the dimensions, display the Text area in the Properties palette, and choose
either Background or a specific color from the Fill Color drop-down list. (To
ensure that dimension text lies on top of other objects, use the DRaworder or
TEXTTOFRONT command — see Chapter 9 for more information.) Note that
turning on background mask in the Multiline Text Editor window, as Chapter 9
tells you to do for regular (nondimension) text, does not work for dimension
text. You must use the Fill Color setting on either the Text tab of the New/
Modify Dimension Style dialog box (as described earlier in this chapter) or
the Properties palette.
The AutoCAD eXplode command on the Modify toolbar will blow a dimension
apart into a bunch of line and multiline text objects. Don’t do it! Exploding a
dimension makes it much harder to edit cleanly and eliminates AutoCAD’s
capability of updating the dimension text measurement automatically.
258
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Editing dimension text
In most cases, you shouldn’t have to edit dimension text. Assuming that
you drew your geometry accurately and picked the dimension points pre-
cisely, AutoCAD displays the right measurement. If you change the size of the
associated object, AutoCAD updates the dimension and its measurement.
However, you occasionally may need to override the dimension text (that is,
replace it with a different measurement) or add a prefix or a suffix to the true
measurement.
AutoCAD creates dimension text as a multiline text (mText) object, so dimen-
sion text has the same editing options as ordinary text. Unfortunately, the
right-click menu for dimension objects doesn’t include a Text Edit option.
You can use the Text Override field in the Properties palette, or type ED (the
keyboard shortcut for the ddEDit command) to edit dimension text in the
Multiline Text Editor window.
The default text is <> (that is, the left and right angled bracket characters),
which acts as a placeholder for the true length. In other words, AutoCAD dis-
plays the true dimension length as text in the actual dimension (and keeps
the text up to date if you change the distance between the dimension’s origin
points). You can override the true length by typing a specific length or other
text string. You can preserve the true length but add a prefix or suffix by
typing it before or after the left- and right-angled bracket characters. In other
words, if you enter <> Max., and the actual distance is 12.00, AutoCAD dis-
plays 12.00 Max. for the dimension text. If you later stretch the object so
that the actual distance changes to 14.50, AutoCAD automatically changes
the dimension text to read 14.50 Max. Now you can appreciate the impor-
tance of drawing and editing geometry precisely!
Avoid the temptation to override the default dimension text by replacing the
angled brackets with a numeric value. Doing so eliminates AutoCAD’s capabil-
ity of keeping dimension measurements current, but even worse, you get no
visual cue that the default distance has been overridden (unless you edit the
dimension text). If you’re overriding dimension text a lot, it’s probably a sign
that the creator of the drawing didn’t pay enough attention to using precision
techniques when drawing and editing. We’re not going to point any fingers,
but you probably know whom to talk to.
Controlling and editing dimension 
associativity
When you add dimensions by selecting objects or picking points on the
objects by using object snap modes, AutoCAD normally creates associative
dimensions, which are connected to the objects and move with them. This is
259
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

the case in new drawings that were originally created in any version of
AutoCAD starting with 2002. 
AutoCAD automatically creates associative dimensions only in AutoCAD 2002
and later drawings. (See the “Dimension associativity” section, earlier in this
chapter, for more information.) If you have to edit drawings created in earlier
versions of AutoCAD, you must set the DIMASSOC system variable to 2 before
AutoCAD 2006 will create the new-style associative dimensions. An easy way
to make this change for the current drawing is to open the Options dialog box
(choose Tools➪Options), click the User Preferences tab, and turn on the
Make New Dimensions Associative setting. Be aware that this setting affects
only new dimensions that you draw from now on. Thus, you’ll end up with
associative new dimensions and non-associative existing dimensions in your
old drawing. Look up “DIMASSOC system variable” in the AutoCAD online
help system for more information.
You aren’t likely to need any of these three commands very often, but if you
do, look up the command name in the online help system:
 DIMREASSOCIATE: If you have dimensions that aren’t currently associa-
tive (probably because they were created in older versions of AutoCAD)
or are associated with the wrong objects, you can use the DIMREASSOCI-
ATE command (Dimensions➪Reassociate Dimensions) to associate them
with points on the objects of your choice.
 DIMDISASSOCIATE: You can use the DIMDISASSOCIATE command to
sever the connection between a dimension and its associated object.
 DIMREGEN: In a few special circumstances, AutoCAD doesn’t automati-
cally update geometry-driven associative dimensions (maybe Autodesk
should call them “usually fully awake but occasionally asleep at the
wheel associative dimensions”). In those cases, the DIMREGEN com-
mand will fix things.
Pointy-Headed Leaders
No, we’re not talking about your boss (or about you, if you happen to be the
boss). We’re talking about arrows that point from your comment to the object
or area about which you’re commenting. AutoCAD treats leaders as a special
kind of dimension object (no jokes about dimwitted leaders, now). You can
draw leaders and text at the same time easily by using the qLEader (Quick
Leader) command, as described in the following steps.
qLEader is an improved version of the old LEADER command, which remains
in AutoCAD 2006 for compatibility reasons. We recommend that you use
qLEader instead of LEADER. Fortunately, the AutoCAD 2006 Dimension menu
and toolbar choices run the qLEader command.
260
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

qLEader is another one of those annoying AutoCAD commands that prompts
you for some information on the command line and some in a dialog box. Pay
close attention to the command line prompts throughout this example:
1. Set a layer that’s appropriate for dimensions current.
See Chapter 5 for the details on setting a layer as current.
2. Set a dimension style that’s appropriate for your needs current.
Choose an existing dimension style from the drop-down list on the Styles
toolbar, or create a new style by using the procedure in the section,
“Creating and managing dimension styles,” earlier in this chapter.
3. Choose Dimension➪Leader or click the Quick Leader button on the
Dimension toolbar.
The command line prompts you to select the first leader point — that is,
the arrowhead point — and gives you the option of changing leader set-
tings first:
Specify first leader point, or [Settings] <Settings>:
If you want to draw curved rather than straight leader lines or choose
a different leader arrowhead style, press Enter now to open the Leader
Settings dialog box.
4. Pick a point that you want to point to.
If you use an object snap mode, such as Nearest or Midpoint, to pick a
point on an object, AutoCAD associates the leader with the object. If you
later move the object, AutoCAD updates the leader so that it points to
the new location.
The command line prompts you for the next point — AutoCAD draws a
shaft from the arrowhead to this point:
Specify next point:
5. Pick a second point.
If you pick a second point that’s too close to the arrowhead point,
AutoCAD doesn’t have enough room to draw the arrowhead, and thus
omits it.
AutoCAD repeats the next point prompt so that you can draw a multiseg-
ment shaft if you want to:
Specify next point:
6. Pick one more point if you want to, or press Enter if you want a leader
with a single shaft.
Pressing Enter tells the qLEader command that you’re finished selecting
the points that define the leader shaft. By default, the qLEader command
lets you pick up to three points (the arrowhead point and two more
261
Chapter 10: Entering New Dimensions

points). You can change this behavior in the Leader Settings dialog box
(refer to Step 3).
The command line prompts you to specify the width for word-wrapping
the text that you’ll attach to the leader:
Specify text width <0.0>:
The default text width, 0.0, turns off word-wrapping and displays your
text on a single line. You can type a width or point and click with the
mouse.
Turning off word-wrapping works fine for short notes that fit on one line.
If you think your note may be longer, specify a width instead of accept-
ing the default value of 0.0.
7. Press Enter to suppress word-wrapping, or move the cursor to the
right or left to specify a width for word-wrapping; then click.
The command line prompts you to type a short note directly at the com-
mand line, or you can press Enter to type your note in the Multiline Text
Editor window:
Enter first line of annotation text <Mtext>:
8. Press Enter to open the Multiline Text Editor window.
9. Enter your comment.
10. Click OK.
The Multiline Text Editor window closes and adds your comment to the
drawing, next to the leader.
Figure 10-11 shows several different leaders with notes.
Figure 10-11:
All leaders
and no
followers.
262
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

If both the leader arrowhead and the text are the wrong size or appear to be
missing entirely, the dimension scale isn’t set correctly in the drawing. (As we
warn you earlier, AutoCAD treats leaders as a special kind of dimension
object.) See Chapter 4 for detailed instructions on how to set the dimension
scale. After you set the dimension scale properly, erase and re-create the
leader and text.
If you add a comment to a drawing and later decide that the comment merits
a leader, you can use the qLEader command to draw the leader so that the
end of the shaft ends up in the vicinity of the existing text object. Then, when
the Multiline Text Editor window appears (Step 8 in the previous steps), click
OK without entering any new text.
A leader and the text that you draw with it are partially associated with each
other. When you move the text, the leader’s shaft follows. Unfortunately, the
converse isn’t true — moving the leader or one of its vertices doesn’t cause
the text to follow.

I
f you were hoping to hatch a plot (or plot a hatch), see Chapter 12 instead.
If you want to hatch an egg, buy our companion book, Raising Chickens For
Dummies. If you need to fill in closed areas of your drawings with special pat-
terns of lines or solid fills, this is your chapter.
Drafters often use hatching to represent the type of material that makes up
an object, such as insulation, metal, concrete, and so on. In other cases,
hatching helps emphasize or clarify the extent of a particular element in the
drawing — for example, showing the location of walls in a building plan, or
highlighting a swampy area on a map so you know where to avoid building a
road. Figure 11-1 shows an example of hatching in a structural detail.
An AutoCAD hatch is a separate object that fills a space, that has an appear-
ance dictated by the hatch pattern assigned to it, and that is associated with
the objects that bound the space, such as lines, polylines, or arcs. If you
move or stretch the boundaries, AutoCAD normally updates the hatching to
fill the resized area.
Don’t go overboard with hatching. The purpose of hatching is to clarify, not
overwhelm, the other geometry in the drawing. If your plots look like a patch-
work quilt of hatch patterns, it’s time to simplify.

Hatching is another kind of annotation of your geometry, similar in purpose
to text and dimensions. As we describe at the beginning of Chapter 9, you’ll
usually be more efficient if you save annotation for later in the drafting
process. Draw as much geometry as possible first, and then hatch the parts
that require it. In other words, batch your hatch.
Hatch . . . Hatch . . . Hatchoo
This section outlines the steps you use to add hatching to a drawing with the
Hatch and Gradient dialog box, shown in Figure 11-2. You can use this infor-
mation to get started quickly with hatching. When you need more informa-
tion about any part of the process, jump to the relevant sections of “Pushing
the Boundary (of) Hatch,” later in this chapter.
The following steps show you how to hatch an enclosed area by using the
“pick points” method of selecting the hatch area:
1. Open a drawing containing geometry that forms fully closed bound-
aries, or draw some boundaries by using the drawing commands we
describe in Chapter 6.
The areas you want to hatch should be completely enclosed. The Circle,
POLygon, and RECtang commands, and the Line and PLine commands
with the Close option, make great hatch boundaries (see Chapter 6 for
details).
Figure 11-1:
A big batch
o’ hatch.
266
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

It’s possible to set an obscure system variable named HPGAPTOL so
that you can hatch an area whose boundaries are not perfectly closed.
We strongly recommend that you ignore this option until you are so pro-
ficient with AutoCAD that you’ll never need it anyway.
2. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 5.
It’s usually best to put hatching on its own layer.
3. Start the Hatch command by clicking the Hatch button on the Draw
toolbar.
The Hatch and Gradient dialog box appears.
4. Choose Predefined, User Defined, or Custom from the Type drop-
down list.
Predefined or User Defined works best for most purposes. See the next
section for details.
5. If you chose Predefined or Custom in the previous step, select any
predefined or custom hatch pattern from the Pattern drop-down list
or the Pattern button just to the right of it. If you chose User Defined,
you don’t need to choose a pattern.
6. Specify an Angle and Scale for the hatch pattern (or, if you chose User
Defined in Step 4, specify Angle and Spacing).
See the section, “Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale,” later in this
chapter, for more information.

7. Click the Pick Points button.
The Hatch and Gradient dialog box (temporarily) disappears, and your
drawing reappears with the following prompt at the command line:
Select internal point:
8. Select a point inside the boundary within which you want to hatch by
clicking it with the mouse.
AutoCAD analyzes the drawing and decides which boundaries to use. In
a complex drawing, this analysis can take several seconds. AutoCAD
highlights the boundary that it finds.
If AutoCAD highlights the wrong boundary, right-click, choose Clear All
from the menu, and try again.
9. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Enter from the
menu to indicate that you’re finished selecting points.
The Hatch and Gradient dialog box reappears.
10. Click the Preview button to preview the hatch.
The Hatch and Gradient dialog box (temporarily) disappears again, and
AutoCAD shows you what the hatch will look like.
Pick or press Esc to return to dialog or <Right-click to
accept hatch>:
11. Click anywhere in the drawing area to return to the Hatch and
Gradient dialog box.
12. Adjust any settings and preview again until you’re satisfied with the
hatch.
13. Click OK.
AutoCAD hatches the area inside the boundary. If you modify the bound-
ary, the hatch automatically resizes to fill the resized area.
Occasionally, AutoCAD gets confused and doesn’t resize a hatch after you
resize the boundary. If that happens, erase and then re-create the hatch in
the resized area.
Pushing the Boundary (of) Hatch
The remainder of this chapter shows you how to refine the techniques pre-
sented in the preceding section. We describe how to copy existing hatching,
take advantage of the various options in the Hatch and Gradient dialog box,
and choose more complicated hatching boundaries.
268
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Hatch from scratch
You can use predefined, user-defined, or custom hatch patterns. Most of the
time, you’ll choose either predefined or user-defined hatch patterns, unless
some generous soul gives you a custom pattern. 
Pick a pattern, any pattern: Predefined hatch patterns
To use AutoCAD’s predefined hatch patterns, select Predefined from the Type
drop-down list at the top of the Hatch tab in the Hatch and Gradient dialog
box. This selection sets the stage for choosing the hatch pattern.
You specify a predefined hatch pattern in one of two ways:
 If you know the name of the hatch pattern, select it from the Pattern
drop-down list. The list is alphabetical, except that SOLID (that is, a
solid fill) is at the very beginning.
 If you don’t know the pattern’s name, or you prefer the visual approach,
click the Pattern button (the tiny button with the ellipsis [three dots] to
the right of the Pattern drop-down list and pattern name) to display the
Hatch Pattern Palette with pattern previews and names.
AutoCAD has about 80 predefined hatch patterns from which to choose.
The list includes ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO
(International Standards Organization) standard hatch patterns. Figure 11-3
shows the some of the Other Predefined hatch patterns, which cover every-
thing from Earth to Escher to Stars. Hatch patterns whose names begin with
AR- are intended for architectural and related industries.
269
Chapter 11: Down the Hatch
Catch a hatch: Copying hatch properties
One slick way to hatch is by using the Inherit
Properties button in the Hatch and Gradient
dialog box to copy hatch properties from an
existing hatch object. Think of it as point and
shoot hatching. If someone — such as you —
added some hatching in the past that’s just like
what you want to use now, click the Inherit
Properties button and pick the existing hatching.
Inherit Properties updates the hatch pattern
settings in the Hatch and Gradient dialog box to
make them the same as the existing hatch pat-
tern object that you picked. You can use the
cloned hatch pattern specifications as is or
modify them by making changes in the Hatch
and Gradient dialog box.
Consistency is a good thing in drafting, espe-
cially in computer-aided drafting, in which some
or all of your drawing may be used for a long
time. Thus, it’s good to use the same hatch pat-
terns, scales, and angles for the same purposes
in all your drawings. Find out whether your pro-
ject, office, company, or profession has hatch-
ing standards that apply to your work.

After you’ve selected a pattern, specify angle and scale, as we describe in the
section, “Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale,” later in this chapter.
It’s up to you: User-defined hatches
A user-defined hatch pattern makes a hatch pattern out of parallel lines. Use
this option to create a simple pattern and specify the space between the lines
in drawing units. For example, you can hatch a wall in a building plan with a
user-defined pattern and specify that the hatch lines be three inches apart.
After you choose User Defined from the Type drop-down list in the Hatch and
Gradient dialog box, you specify the angle and spacing of the lines. You can
select the Double check box to achieve a crosshatching effect (two perpen-
dicular sets of hatching lines).
Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale
Predefined and custom hatch patterns require that you enter the angle and
scale for AutoCAD to generate the hatching. You usually won’t have any trou-
ble deciding on an appropriate angle, but a suitable scale can be tricky.
The hatch scale usually should be a pattern-specific multiplier times the draw-
ing scale factor, as described in Chapter 4. For example, the EARTH pattern
(in the Other Predefined tab of the Hatch Pattern Palette; refer to Figure 11-3)
looks pretty good in a full scale (1 = 1) drawing with a hatch scale of 0.75. If
you’re adding EARTH pattern hatching to a 1" = 1'–0" detail (drawing scale
factor equals 12), try using a hatch scale of 0.75 × 12, or 9.0. This pattern-
specific multiplier and drawing-scale-factor approach ensures that hatching
looks consistent (that the spaces between the lines are the same) at all scales
when you plot.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

271
Chapter 11: Down the Hatch
Make it solid, man
Although you may not guess it, AutoCAD treats
filling an area with a solid color as a type of
hatching. Simply choose SOLID from the top of
the Pattern drop-down list.
Like any other object, a solid hatch takes on the
current object color — or the current layer’s
color if you leave color set to ByLayer. Therefore,
check whether the current object layer and color
are set appropriately before you use the Solid
hatching option (see Chapter 5 for details).
You can create the effect of a solid fill in
AutoCAD in several other ways:
 If you want a filled-in circle or donut, use
the DOnut command and specify an inside
diameter of 0.
 If you want one or more line segments with
either uniform or tapered widths, use the
PLine command’s Width option. (Chapter 6
discusses the DOnut and PLine commands.)
 If you want a pattern that starts out solid but
then fades away (or transitions to a differ-
ent color) in one or more directions, use the
Gradient tab on the Hatch and Gradient
dialog box (not included in AutoCAD LT).
This option creates a gradient fill. You can
control the color(s), direction(s), and angle
of the gradient.
Solid and gradient fills are a good way to mimic
poché — an old hand-drafting technique in
which you shade areas with a lighter colored
pencil (usually red) to make those areas appear
lightly shaded on blueline prints. The following
figure shows some examples of solid and gra-
dient fills.

Assuming that you know your drawing’s scale factor, the only complication is
figuring out what the pattern-specific multiplier should be for a particular
hatch pattern. In a more rational world, the pattern-specific multiplier would
always be something sensible, like 1.0. Unfortunately, that’s not the case for all
hatch pattern definitions. Even worse, there’s no way to predict before you
use a hatch pattern for the first time what an appropriate pattern-specific mul-
tiplier might be. (Autodesk created the hatch patterns whose names begins
with AR- — that is, the ones intended for architectural drawings — with a final
hatch scale of 1.0 in mind, but in some cases, you’ll have to adjust up or down
in order to achieve a suitable scale.) You have to use trial and error the first
time, and then make a note of the hatch pattern and multiplier for future use.
The first time you use a hatch pattern definition, try 1.0 as the multiplier. Don’t
forget to multiply by the drawing scale factor. Preview the hatch and then
adjust the hatch scale iteratively; preview after each change. After you settle
upon a scale for the current drawing, calculate the corresponding multiplier
(for future use); divide the hatch scale by the current drawing’s scale factor.
User-defined patterns require that you enter an angle and spacing, not angle
and scale. Spacing is expressed in the current drawing units.
Do fence me in: Defining hatch boundaries
After you specify the hatch pattern, angle, and scale you want to use, you
define the boundary (or boundaries) into which you want to pour that hatch
pattern in one of two ways: 
 Picking points within the area(s) you want hatched
 Selecting objects that surround those areas
The actual operation involved in using either of these options is confusing to
most people. You’ll probably need a little practice before you get used to it.
The idea behind either definition option is simple when applied to simple
areas — that is, closed areas with no additional objects inside them. To
define the hatch boundary for a simple area, do one of these two things:
 Click the Pick Points button in the Hatch and Gradient dialog box and
then click a point inside the boundary. 
 Click the Select Objects button and select one or more objects that form
a fully closed boundary.
This simple hatching gets more complicated if you have one closed object
inside another, as in Figure 11-4. The AutoCAD hatch preview and a bit of
experimentation will clarify all these potentially puzzling permutations.
272
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

As we warn earlier in this chapter, boundaries should be completely closed
before AutoCAD will hatch them. That’s one of the reasons you should employ
the precision techniques from this book whenever you draw or edit objects.
If the lines surrounding your boundary don’t either meet exactly or cross,
AutoCAD scolds you with a Valid hatch boundary not found error 
message.
The Valid hatch boundary not found error message means that you
need to “repair” lines or other objects so they are a fully closed boundary.
Sometimes you can use the Fillet command with a zero fillet radius to force two
lines to meet exactly. Another possibility is to use grip editing to align one end-
point precisely with another. Chapter 7 discusses these two editing techniques.
Hatching that knows its place
AutoCAD 2006’s Hatch and Gradient dialog box includes a Draw Order drop-
down list that controls where AutoCAD places the hatching with respect to the
boundary. (Refer to Figure 11-2.) The default setting, Send behind Boundary,
puts the hatching “underneath” its boundary for object selection purposes,
and that’s usually exactly what you want.
Pick inside
a simple area.
Pick one point
between two areas.
Pick points
inside both areas.
Select a single
boundary object.
Select one boundary object
with another nested inside.
Select both
boundary objects.

Chapter 11: Down the Hatch

Have palette, will hatch
With Tool Palettes, described in Chapter 2, you can create click-and-drag
hatch palettes. With a hatch palette, you click a tool (a swatch) and drag into
an enclosed boundary to hatch the area. If your hatching needs are simple,
you can create a Tool Palette for the patterns and scales you often use.
See “hatches, adding to tool palettes” in AutoCAD’s online help for more
information. 
Editing Hatch Objects
Editing an existing hatch pattern is simple after you’re familiar with the Hatch
and Gradient dialog box. Follow these steps:
1. Select the hatch object.
2. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Hatch Edit from
the menu.
AutoCAD opens the Hatch Edit dialog box and displays the hatch
object’s current settings.
3. Make any desired changes, use the Preview button to look them over,
and click OK to keep the changes.
Alternatively, you can use the Properties palette (described in Chapter 7) to
make most existing hatch pattern changes. The Properties palette is espe-
cially good for changing several hatches at once.
To make one hatch look like another, use the Match Properties button on the
Standard toolbar.
AutoCAD 2006 has a number of useful enhancements to hatching. You can
easily set a new origin point for hatch objects, you can hatch areas that are
not fully visible on-screen, and you can optionally hatch multiple boundaries
at one go and have the hatches treated as individual objects. Our favorite:
The Properties palette now shows the area of selected hatches.

espite the increasing number of offices with a computer (or two) on
every desk, many people still need to or want to work with printed
drawings. Perhaps you thought that using AutoCAD means you don’t have to
rely on hard-copy versions of drawings, but can view them on-screen instead.
Even if that’s true, you may need to give hard-copy prints to your less savvy
colleagues who don’t have AutoCAD. You may want to make some quick
prints to pore over during your bus ride home. You may find that checking
drawings the old-fashioned way — with a hard-copy print and a red pencil —
turns up errors that managed to remain hidden on the computer screen.
Whatever the reason, you’ll want to print drawings at some point — probably
sooner rather than later. Depending on where you are in a project, plotting is
the pop quiz, midterm, or final exam of your drawing-making semester. This
chapter helps you ace the test.
You Say Printing, I Say Plotting
Plotting originally meant creating hard-copy output on a device that was capa-
ble of printing on larger sheets, such as D size or E size, that measure several
feet on a side. (See Chapter 4 for information about drafting paper sizes.)
These plotters often used pens to draw, robot-fashion, on large sheets of
vellum or drafting film. The sheets could then be run through diazo blueline

machines — copying machines that create blueline prints — in order to
create less-expensive copies. Printing meant creating hard-copy output on
ordinary printers that used ordinary-sized paper, such as A size (letter size,
81⁄2 x 11 inches) or B size (tabloid or ledger size, 11 x 17 inches).
Nowadays, AutoCAD and most CAD users make no distinction between plot-
ting and printing. AutoCAD veterans usually say “plotting,” so if you want to
be hip, you can do so, too.
Whatever you call it, plotting an AutoCAD drawing is considerably more com-
plicated than printing a word processing document or a spreadsheet. CAD
has a larger range of different plotters and printers, drawing types, and
output procedures than other computer applications. AutoCAD tries to help
you tame the vast jungle of plotting permutations, but you’ll probably find
that you have to take some time to get the lay of the land and clear a path to
your desired hard-copy output.
Get with the system
One of the complications you face in your attempts to create a hard copy is
that AutoCAD has two distinct ways of communicating with your plotters and
printers. Operating systems, and the programs that run in them, use a special
piece of software called a printer driver to format data for printing and then
send it to the printer or plotter. When you configure Windows to recognize a
new printer connected to your computer or your network, you’re actually
installing the printer’s driver. (“Bring the Rolls around front, James. And bring
me a gin and tonic and a D-size plot while you’re at it.”) AutoCAD, like other
Windows programs, works with the printers you’ve configured in Windows.
AutoCAD calls these system printers because they’re part of the Windows
system.
But AutoCAD, unlike other Windows programs, can’t leave well enough alone.
Some output devices, especially some larger plotters, aren’t controlled very
efficiently by Windows system printer drivers. For that reason, AutoCAD comes
with specialized nonsystem drivers (that is, drivers that are not installed as part
of the Windows system) for plotters from companies such as Hewlett-Packard,
Xerox, and Océ. These drivers are kind of like nonunion workers. They ignore
the tidy rules for communicating with Windows printers in order to get things
done a bit more quickly and flexibly.
Using already-configured Windows system printer drivers usually is easiest,
and they work well with many devices — especially devices such as laser and
inkjet printers that print on smaller paper. However, if you have a large plotter,
you may be able to get faster plotting, better plot quality, or more plot features
by installing a nonsystem driver. To find out more, choose Contents➪Driver
and Peripheral Guide➪Use Plotters and Printers in the AutoCAD online help
system.
276
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Configure it out
For now, you simply should make sure that AutoCAD recognizes the devices
that you want to use for plotting. The following steps show you how:
1. Launch AutoCAD and open an existing drawing or start a new, blank
drawing.
2. Choose Tools➪Options to open the Options dialog box, and click the
Plot and Publish tab.
3. Click the drop-down arrow to view the list just below the Use As
Default Output Device option, as shown in Figure 12-1.
The list includes two kinds of device configurations, designated by two
tiny, difficult-to-distinguish icons to the left of the device names: 
• A little laser printer icon, with a sheet of white paper coming out
the top, indicates a Windows system printer configuration. 
• A little plotter icon, with a piece of paper coming out the front,
indicates a nonsystem (that is, AutoCAD-specific) configuration.
The nonsystem configuration names always end in .pc3, because they’re
stored in special AutoCAD Printer Configuration version 3 files. So, if you
can’t tell the difference between the icons, look for the .pc3 at the end of
the name.

4. Verify that the list includes the printers and plotters that you want to
have available in AutoCAD.
If not, choose Start➪Printers and Faxes (in Windows XP) or Start➪
Settings➪Printers (in Windows 2000), launch the Add Printer Wizard,
and follow the instructions. If your printer isn’t in the default Windows
list, cancel the wizard and hunt down a driver disk that came with your
printer, or better yet, download the current driver from the printer manu-
facturer’s Web site.
5. Choose the output device that you want to make the default for new
drawings.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and retain any changes that you
made in the previous step.
You use the AutoCAD Plotter Manager Add-A-Plotter Wizard to create nonsys-
tem driver configurations. (Choose File➪Plotter Manager to display a window
containing a shortcut to the wizard.) This wizard is similar to the Windows
Add Printer Wizard; if you can handle adding an ordinary printer in Windows,
you probably can handle adding a nonsystem plotter configuration to
AutoCAD. When you complete the wizard steps, AutoCAD saves the informa-
tion in a PC3 (Plot Configuration version 3) file. If you add an HP Designjet
plotter, you may be advised by the Add-A-Plotter Wizard to install a custom
driver (see the online help for more information). Many people find that the
standard drivers work fine, but as we mention below, custom drivers may
include additional paper sizes as well as other handy settings.
A Simple Plot
Okay, so you believe us. You know that you’re not going to master AutoCAD
plotting in five minutes. That doesn’t change the fact that your boss, employee,
wife, husband, construction foreman, or 11-year-old son wants a quick check
plot of your drawing.
Plotting success in 16 steps
Here’s the quick, cut-to-the-chase procedure for plotting a simple drawing —
a mere 16 steps! This procedure assumes that you plot in model space — that
is, that the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing area shows the drawing in
a way that you want to plot. (We cover plotting paper space layout tabs in
the section, “Plotting the Layout of the Land,” later in this chapter.) This pro-
cedure doesn’t deal with controlling plotted lineweights. (See the “Plotting
Lineweights and Colors” section later in this chapter for those details.) It
should, however, result in a piece of paper that bears some resemblance to
what AutoCAD displays on your computer monitor.
278
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Follow these steps to make a simple, not-to-scale, monochrome plot of a
drawing:
1. Open the drawing in AutoCAD.
2. Click the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing area to ensure that
you’re plotting the model space contents.
We explain model space and paper space in Chapter 4, and we explain
how to plot paper space layouts later in this chapter.
3. Zoom to the drawing’s current extents (choose View➪Zoom➪Extents)
so you can verify the area you’re going to plot.
The extents of a drawing consist of a rectangular area just large enough
to include all the objects in the drawing.
4. To display the Plot dialog box, click the Plot button on the Standard
toolbar.
The Plot dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-2.
5. In the Printer/Plotter area, select a device from the Name drop-down
list.
More options button
Figure 12-2:
The Plot

279
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

6. In the Paper Size area, select a paper size that’s loaded in your printer
or plotter.
Of course, you must make sure that the paper size is large enough to fit
the drawing at the scale you want to plot it at. For example, if you want
to plot a D-size drawing, but you have only a B-size printer, you’re out of
luck — unless you resort to multiple pieces of paper and lots of tape.
7. In the Plot Area area (sponsored by the Department of Redundancy
Department), choose Extents from the What to Plot drop-down list.
If you set limits properly, as we suggest in Chapter 4, then choose Limits
instead to plot the drawing area that you defined. The Window option —
that is, plot a window whose corners you pick — is useful when you
want to plot just a portion of your drawing. 
8. In the Plot Offset area, select the Center the Plot check box.
Alternatively, you can specify offsets of zero or other amounts in order
to position the plot at a specific location on the paper.
9. In the Plot Scale area, either select the Fit to Paper check box, or
uncheck Fit to Paper and specify a scale (by choosing from the drop-
down list or typing into the two text boxes).
For most real plotting, you’ll plot to a specific scale, but feel free to
select the Fit to Paper check box for now. If you do want to plot to a spe-
cific scale, see the “Instead of fit, scale it” section later in this chapter
for guidance.
10. Click the More Options button (at the bottom-right corner of the
dialog box, next to the Help button).
The Plot dialog box reveals additional settings, as shown in Figure 12-3.
Figure 12-3:
The
expanded
Plot dialog

280
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

11. In the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area, choose
monochrome.ctb or monochrome.stb from the drop-down list.
AutoCAD may ask you whether to “Assign this plot style table to all 
layouts?” Answer Yes to make monochrome.ctb (or monochrome.stb)
the default plot style table for the paper space layout tabs as well as
the Model tab, or answer No to make the change apply only to the cur-
rent tab.
The “Plotting with style” section, later in this chapter, describes plot
style tables.
12. In the Plot Options area, make sure that the Plot with Plot Styles
check box is selected and that the Save Changes to Layout check box
is deselected, as shown in Figure 12-3.
Leaving the Save Changes to Layout check box deselected tells AutoCAD
to use any plot settings changes that you make only for this plot —
AutoCAD will revert to the original plot settings the next time you plot
the drawing.
After you become confident with plotting, you may want to select this
check box so that AutoCAD does save your plotting settings changes as
the default. Alternatively, click the Apply to Layout button to make the
current plot settings the default for future plotting of this tab (that is,
the Model tab) in this drawing.
13. In the Drawing Orientation area, choose Portrait or Landscape.
The postage stamp-sized preview in the middle of the Plot dialog box
should help you decide on the right orientation. If not, the full preview in
the next step will tell you for sure.
14. Click the Preview button and check that the drawing displays on the
paper at the correct orientation and size, as shown in Figure 12-4;
then right-click and choose Exit to return to the Plot dialog box.
15. If you found any problems in the preview, adjust the plot settings (for
example, Plot Area, Plot Scale, or Drawing Orientation) and repeat
the preview until the plot looks right.
16. Click OK to create the plot.
When AutoCAD finishes generating and sending the plot, it displays a
Plot and Publish Job Complete balloon notification from the status bar.
If you decide that you don’t want to see these notifications, right-click
the Plot/Publish Details Report Available icon near the right end of the
status bar and deselect Enable Balloon Notification.
281
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

There — 16 steps, as promised. If for some reason your plot didn’t work, well,
we warned you that AutoCAD plotting was complicated and temperamental!
Read the rest of this chapter for all the details about the numerous other
plotting options that can cause plotting to go awry. If you’re in a big hurry,
turn directly to the troubleshooting section, “Troubles with Plotting,” at the
end of the chapter.
Preview one, two
One of the keys to efficient plotting is liberal use of AutoCAD’s preview fea-
ture. (To maintain political fairness, we recommend conservative use of some
other AutoCAD options elsewhere in the book.)
The postage stamp-sized partial preview in the middle of the Plot dialog box
is a quick reality check to make sure your plot fits on the paper and is turned
in the right direction. If the plot area at the current scale is too large for the
paper, AutoCAD displays thick red warning lines along the side(s) of the
sheet where the drawing will be truncated.
Click the Preview button to see a full preview in a separate window. You
see exactly how your drawing lays out on the paper and how the various
Figure 12-4:
Preview of
coming plot-
tractions.
282
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

lineweights, colors, and other object plot properties will appear. You can
zoom and pan around the preview by using the right-click menu. (Any zoom-
ing or panning that you do does not affect what area of the drawing gets 
plotted — zooming and panning is just a way to get a better look at different
areas of the plot preview.)
Instead of fit, scale it
In most real plotting situations, you want to plot to a specific scale rather
than let AutoCAD choose an oddball scale that just happens to maximize the
drawing on the paper. And if you’re going to plot the Model tab of a drawing
to scale, you need to know its drawing scale factor. Chapter 4 describes setup
concepts and Chapter 9 provides some tips for determining the scale factor
of a drawing that someone else created.
If your drawing was created at a standard scale, such as 1:50 or 1⁄4"=1'–0", then
you simply choose the scale from the handy Scale drop-down list in the Plot
dialog box. If your scale is not in the list, then type the ratio between plotted
distance and AutoCAD drawing distance into the two text boxes below the
Scale drop-down list, as shown in Figure 12-5. The easiest way to express the
ratio usually is to type 1 (one) in the upper box and the drawing scale factor
in the lower box. (See Chapter 4 for more information.)
Your CAD manager may have used AutoCAD 2006’s new Edit Scale List dialog
box to add uncommon scales or to remove scales that your company never
uses. If you’re designing espresso machines in Milano, for example, you’ll
probably never need to plot your drawings at 1⁄128"=1'–0".
Creating half-size plots for some purposes is common in some industries. To
plot model space half-size, double the drawing scale factor. For example, a
1⁄8"=1'–0" drawing has a drawing scale factor of 96, which is equivalent to a
plot scale of 1=96. To make a half-size model space plot of it, specify a plot
scale of 1=192 (or choose 1⁄16"=1'–0" from the Scale drop-down list).
Even if you work with drawings that are created to be plotted at a specific
scale, plotting with a Fit to Paper scale may be the most efficient way to make
a reduced-size check plot. For example, drafters in your office might create
drawings that get plotted on D size sheets (24 x 36 inches), whereas you have
access to a laser printer with a B size (11 x 17 inches) paper tray. By plotting
the D size drawings scaled to fit on B size paper, you end up with check plots
that are slightly smaller than half size (11⁄24 size, to be exact). You won’t be able
to measure distances on the check plots with a scale, but you probably will
be able to check them visually for overall correctness.
283
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

Plotting the Layout of the Land
In the previous section, we show you how to plot the model space represen-
tation of your drawing by making sure that the Model tab is active when you
open the Plot dialog box. However, paper space gives you many additional
options for controlling the look of your output, without having to modify the
underlying geometry. So in some drawings, you may want to plot a paper
space layout instead.
About paper space layouts and plotting
As Chapter 4 describes, you can use AutoCAD’s paper space feature to com-
pose one or more layouts for plotting your drawing in particular ways. Each
layout lives on a separate tab, which you click at the bottom of the drawing
area. In addition, AutoCAD saves plot settings (plot device, paper size, plot
scale, and so on) separately for each of the tabs — that is, for each of the
layout tabs as well as the Model tab.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

Whether to plot model space or a paper space layout in a drawing depends
entirely on how the drawing was set up. If you or someone else went through
a layout setup procedure similar to the one in Chapter 4, then you probably
should plot the paper space layout. If not, then plot the Model tab.
Don’t confuse the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing area with the
MODEL/PAPER button on the status bar. The tabs control which view of the
drawing (model space or a paper space layout) fills the drawing area. When
a paper space layout fills the drawing area, the status bar button controls
whether drawing and editing take place in paper space or in model space
inside a viewport. When you plot a layout, it doesn’t matter whether the
MODEL/PAPER button says MODEL or PAPER — AutoCAD always plots the
paper space layout (not just the contents of model space in the viewport).
The presence of a Layout1 tab next to the Model tab at the bottom of the
drawing area doesn’t necessarily mean that the drawing contains an already
set up paper space layout. AutoCAD always displays a Layout1 tab when you
open a drawing created in AutoCAD Release 14 or earlier, and it displays a
Layout1 and Layout2 tab when you open a drawing created in AutoCAD 2000
or later. Layout1 and Layout2 are simply AutoCAD’s default names; the cre-
ator of the drawing may have renamed them to something more descriptive.
If you don’t have any paper space drawings handy, you can use one of the
AutoCAD sample drawings, such as the mechanical drawing stored in
C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2006\Sample\Welding Fixture-1.dwg.
The path to paper space 
layout plotting success
Plotting a paper space layout is pretty much like plotting model space, except
that you need to find the appropriate layout first and make sure that its tab is
selected before you open the Plot dialog box:
1. Click the layout tabs at the bottom of the drawing area until you find a
suitably set up layout.
If no one has set up the layout yet, AutoCAD creates a default layout. (If
the Show Page Setup Manager for New Layouts setting on the Display
tab of the Options dialog box is turned on, you’ll see the Page Setup
Manager dialog box first — just click the Close button.) The default
layout probably won’t be useful for real projects, but you use it to find
out about the layout plotting procedure. Refer to Chapter 4 for instruc-
tions on creating a real layout.
285
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

2. Click the Plot button on the Standard toolbar.
The Plot dialog box appears.
3. Specify a Printer/Plotter Name and a Paper Size.
4. In the What to Plot drop-down list, choose Layout.
5. Specify the Plot Offset (such as zero in both the X and Y directions).
6. In the Plot Scale area, select 1:1 from the Scale drop-down list.
One of the big advantages of layouts is that you don’t need to know any-
thing about drawing scale in order to plot the drawing — hence the name
paper space. Figure 12-6 shows the proper settings for plotting a layout.
To create a half-size plot of a layout, select 1:2 from the Scale drop-down
list. In addition, select the Scale Lineweights check box in order to
reduce lineweights proportionally. (We cover plotting lineweights later
in this chapter.)
If you find that the layout is too big for your plotter’s largest paper size
at a plot scale of 1:1, you can select Extents from the What to Plot drop-
down list and then select the Fit to Paper check box in the Plot Scale
area. Alternatively, you can close the Plot dialog box and fix the problem
if you want to have a paper space layout that permanently reflects a new
paper size. Use the Page Setup dialog box to modify the layout settings,
or copy the layout and modify the new layout.
Scale = 1:1

7. Click the More Options button and change any additional plot options
that you want to.
Refer to Steps 11 through 13 in the section, “Plotting success in 16 steps.” 
8. Click the Preview button, ensure that the drawing displays on the
paper at the correct orientation and size, and then right-click and
choose Exit to return to the Plot dialog box.
If you found any problems in the preview, change your plot settings and
preview again until it looks right.
9. Click OK to create the plot.
Plotting Lineweights and Colors
In previous sections of this chapter, we help you gain some plotting confi-
dence. Those sections show you how to create scaled, monochrome plots
with uniform lineweights in model space or paper space. Those skills may be
all you need, but if you care about controlling plotted lineweights and colors,
or adding special effects such as screening (plotting shades of gray), read on.
Plotting with style
Plot styles provide a way to override object properties with alternative plot
properties. (See Chapter 5 for information about object properties.) The
properties include plotted lineweight, plotted color, and screening (plotting
shades of gray). Figure 12-7 shows the full range of options. Plot styles come
in two exciting flavors:
 Color-dependent plot styles
 Named plot styles
Color-dependent plot styles are based on the standard way of plotting in ear-
lier versions of AutoCAD (before AutoCAD 2000), whereas named plot styles
provide a newer way.
It’s remotely possible that you won’t need to bother with plot styles. If
the drawings you want to plot have layer and object properties (especially
lineweight) that reflect how you want objects to plot, you can dispense
with plot styles. But most people and most drawings use plot styles, so you
should at least be familiar with them.
287
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

A couple of common reasons for using plot styles are to
 Map screen colors to plotted lineweights. If this idea seems completely
loony to you, try to suspend judgment until you’ve read the “Plotting
through thick and thin” section, a bit later in this chapter.
 Create screened lines on monochrome plots. Lines that are screened
display in various shades of gray, not black. Drafters sometimes use
screened lines to de-emphasize secondary objects that otherwise would
overwhelm the main objects in the drawing. Screening is expressed as
a percentage, with 100 percent being completely black and 0 percent
being invisible.
Using plot styles
If you want objects in your drawing to plot with properties that differ from
their display properties, you need plot styles. For example, you can plot with
different lineweights or colors from the ones you’re using for display pur-
poses. Or, as we mention in the preceding section, you may need to map dis-
play colors to plotted lineweights. AutoCAD groups plot styles into plot style
tables, each of which is stored in a separate file.
Color-dependent plot style tables live in Color TaBle (CTB) files and they map
the 255 AutoCAD display colors to 255 plot styles. AutoCAD automatically
attaches the color-dependent plot styles to every object, based on — you
guessed it — the object’s color. (Are those AutoCAD programmers brilliant, or
what?) Color-dependent plot style tables are especially handy for mimicking
Figure 12-7:
Editing a
color-
dependent
plot style
table.
288
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

the old color-mapped-to-lineweight plotting approach of AutoCAD R14 and
earlier releases; this remains the most common method in most companies.
Named plot style tables live in Style TaBle (STB) files. After you’ve created a
named plot style table, you create one or more plot styles and give them
any names you like. Then you can assign the named plot styles to layers or
to individual objects. (See Chapter 5 for more information about object and
layer properties.)
“Named” refers to the plot styles, not to the tables. Both color-dependent
plot style tables and named plot style tables have names because both are
stored in files and files have to have names. But color-dependent plot styles
don’t have names and named plot styles do have names.
To use a plot style table and its included plot styles (whether they’re color-
dependent or named), you must attach it to model space or a paper space
layout. The plot style table then affects plotting only for that tab. This
approach lets you plot the same drawing in different ways by attaching 
different plot styles to different tabs.
You can attach a plot style to model space or a paper space layout by select-
ing its tab at the bottom of the drawing area, opening the Plot dialog box or
Page Setup Manager dialog box, and choosing the plot style table name in the
Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area of the expanded Plot dialog box. See
the section, “Controlling plotted lineweights with screen colors,” later in this
chapter, for an example.
When you start a new drawing in the usual way — that is, by using a template
drawing (see Chapter 4), the template drawing’s plot style behavior deter-
mines whether you can choose CTB or STB files. (That’s why most of
AutoCAD’s stock template drawings come in Color Dependent Plot Styles and
Named Plot Styles versions.) If you want to change from color-dependent plot
styles to named plot styles (or vice versa) in a particular drawing, use the
CONVERTPSTYLES command.
The Plotting tab on the Options dialog box contains a setting called Default
Plot Style Behavior for New Drawings, but it’s practically useless. It doesn’t
change the current drawing and, despite its name, doesn’t even affect new
drawings that you start from a template drawing.
Creating plot styles
If you’re really lucky, you won’t need to use plot styles. If you’re somewhat
lucky, you’ll need to use plot styles, but someone will provide the plot style
table files for you. If that’s the case, you must put the CTB or STB files in your
Plot Styles folder in order for AutoCAD to recognize them. (To find the loca-
tion of your Plot Styles folder, open the Options dialog box, choose the Files
tab, and look for the Printer Support File Path➪Plot Style Table Search Path
setting.)
289
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

If you’re not lucky at all, then you’ll need to be smart — that is, you’ll want to
know how to create your own plot style table files. Here’s how:
1. Choose File➪Plot Style Manager.
The Plot Styles folder opens in a separate window.
2. Double-click the Add-A-Plot Style Table Wizard program shortcut.
3. Read the opening screen and then click Next.
4. Choose the Start From Scratch option, or one of the other three options
if you want to start with settings from another file. Then click Next.
The remaining steps in this procedure assume that you chose Start From
Scratch. If you chose another option, simply follow the wizard’s prompts.
If the creator of a drawing provides you with an AutoCAD R14/AutoCAD
LT 98 PC2 (version 2) or AutoCAD R12/AutoCAD LT 95 PCP (version 1)
file, choose the Use a PCP or PC2 File option. With this option, the
wizard imports color-to-plotted-lineweight settings automatically.
5. Choose whether you want to create a color-dependent plot style table
(CTB file) or a named plot style table (STB file). Then click Next.
Choose Color-Dependent Plot Style Table in order to map screen colors
to plotted lineweights. Choose Named Plot Style Table in order to leave
screen colors alone (so that the colors plot as you see them on-screen)
and to create named plot styles that you can apply to layers or objects.
6. Type a name for the new CTB or STB file, and then click Next.
7. Click the Plot Style Table Editor button.
The Plot Style Table Editor dialog box opens (refer to Figure 12-7).
8. If you created a color-dependent plot style table, assign Lineweight,
Screening, or other plot properties to each color that’s used in the
drawing. If you created a named plot style table, click the Add Style
button, and then assign plot properties to each of the named styles
that you create.
To determine which colors are used in a drawing, switch to the AutoCAD
window and open the Layer Properties Manager dialog box by clicking
the Layers button located on the Object Properties toolbar.
To change a setting for all colors or named styles, select all of them first
by clicking the first color or named style, holding down the Shift key,
scrolling to the end of the list, and then clicking the last color or named
style. Any subsequent changes you make get applied to all the selected
colors or named styles.

9. Click the Save & Close button to close the Plot Style Table Editor
dialog box. Then click Finish to complete the steps for the wizard.
The Plot Styles folder now displays your new CTB or STB file.
10. Close the Plot Styles folder by clicking on the X in its title bar.
Creating your first plot style table can be a harrowing experience, because
you have so many options. Just remember that your most likely reason for
creating one is to map screen colors to plotted lineweights (as we describe
in greater detail in the next section). Also remember that you may be able to
minimize your effort by getting a CTB file from the person who created the
drawing that you want to plot.
In Chapter 5, we recommend that you limit yourself to the first 9 Standard
AutoCAD Colors when defining layers, and not a patchwork of the 255 colors
that AutoCAD makes available. If you follow our advice, your work to create
a color-dependent plot style table will be much reduced, because you’ll have
to assign plot properties for only 9 colors, rather than worrying about 255
of them.
You can use the file found in C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2006\Sample\
Plot Screening and Fill Patterns.dwg for systematic testing of your
CTB files. This drawing shows an array of color swatches for all 255 AutoCAD
colors. Some of the other tabs (such as Grayscale and Screening 25%) also
demonstrate how different CTB files attached to the same layout produce
radically different results.
If you really get carried away and decide to take advantage of the 16 million-
odd colors in AutoCAD’s True Color capability, then you’re not going to be
controlling lineweights with color-dependent plot styles. CTB plot styles
affect the lineweights only of objects that use the traditional 255 colors of the
AutoCAD Color Index palette. If you want True Color, use object lineweights
or named plot styles to control plotted lineweight.
Your life is simpler if you use AutoCAD LT. Only the full version of AutoCAD
supports True Color mode.
Plotting through thick and thin
Long ago, manual drafters developed the practice of drawing lines of different
thicknesses, or lineweights, in order to distinguish different kinds of objects.
Manual drafters did it with different technical ink pen nib diameters or with
different hardnesses of pencil lead and varying degrees of pressure on the
291
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

pencil. Because a computer mouse usually doesn’t come with different diam-
eters of mouse balls or a pressure-sensitive button, the AutoCAD developers
had to figure out how to let users indicate lineweights on-screen and on a
plot. They came up with two different ways to indicate lineweight: 
 Mapping on-screen colors to plotted lineweights. We describe this
common approach in Chapter 5.
 Displaying lineweights on-screen to match what the user can expect to
see on the plot. This approach first appeared in AutoCAD 2000.
Controlling plotted lineweights with object lineweights
Plotting object lineweights is trivial, assuming that the person who created
the drawing took the trouble to assign lineweights to layers or objects (see
Chapter 5 for details). Just make sure that the Plot Object Lineweights check
box in the expanded Plot dialog box is checked. You may also want to dese-
lect the Plot with Plot Styles check box, because plot styles can override the
object lineweights with different plotted lineweights.
As long as you check the Plot Object Lineweights check box, you’ll find that
(those who hate cheap puns, read no further!) the plot thickens! It also thins,
but that’s not as punny.
If you don’t want to plot the lineweights assigned to objects, you must uncheck
both the Plot Object Lineweights and Plot with Plot Styles check boxes in the
Plot Options area of the Plot dialog box. Checking Plot with Plot Styles checks
Plot Object Lineweights as well.
292
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Plotting with plodders
Color-as-color and lineweight-as-lineweight
seem like great ideas, but Autodesk knew when
it added object lineweights back in 1999 that
longtime users of AutoCAD weren’t going to
abandon the old colors-mapped-to-lineweights
approach overnight. Thus, you can still control
plotted lineweight by display color in AutoCAD.
AutoCAD veterans by and large have chosen to
stick with the Old Way for now. They’ve done so
for a variety of reasons, including inertia, plot-
ting procedures and drawings built around
the Old Way, third-party applications that don’t
fully support the newer methods, and the
need to exchange drawings with clients and
subcontractors who haven’t upgraded. In sum-
mary, the ripple effect of those who need to or
want to continue using colors-mapped-to-
lineweights is lasting a long time. Don’t be sur-
prised if you find yourself going with the flow for
a while.
The default setting in AutoCAD 2006 is to plot
object lineweights, so that’s the easiest method
if you don’t have to consider the historical prac-
tices or predilections of other people with whom
you exchange drawings. Mapping screen colors
to lineweights requires some initial work on your
part, but after you’ve set up the mapping scheme,
the additional effort is minimal.

Controlling plotted lineweights with screen colors
To map screen colors to plotted lineweights, you need a color-dependent plot
style table (CTB file), as we describe in the section “Plotting with style,” ear-
lier in this chapter. If you’re plotting a drawing created by someone else, that
someone else may be able to supply you with the appropriate CTB file, or at
least with a PCP or PC2 file from which you can create the CTB file quickly. At
the very least, the creator of the drawing should be able to give you a printed
chart showing which plotted lineweight to assign to each AutoCAD screen
color. Use the instructions in the “Plotting with style” section to copy or
create the required CTB file.
Unfortunately, no industry-wide standards exist for mapping screen colors to
plotted lineweights. Different offices do it differently. That’s why it’s so useful
to receive a CTB, PCP, or PC2 file with drawings that someone sends you.
After you have the appropriate CTB file stored in your Plot Styles folder,
follow these steps to use it:
1. Click the tab that you want to plot — the Model tab or the desired
paper space layout tab.
2. Click the Plot button on the Standard toolbar.
3. In the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area on the expanded Plot
dialog box, select the CTB file from the drop-down list, as shown in
Figure 12-8.
This action attaches the plot style table (CTB file) to the tab that you
clicked in Step 1.

Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

4. Click the Apply to Layout button.
AutoCAD records the plot setting change with the current tab’s configu-
ration information. Assuming that you save the drawing, AutoCAD uses
the CTB that you selected as the default plot style when you (or other
people) plot that tab in the future.
5. Continue with the plotting procedures described earlier in this 
chapter.
If your drawing uses a named plot style table instead of a color-dependent
plot style table, you follow the same procedure, except that you select an
STB file instead of a CTB file in Step 3. 
You can tell whether the current drawing was set up to use color-dependent
plot styles or named plot styles by looking at the Properties toolbar. If the
last drop-down list (Plot Style Control) is grayed out, the drawing can use
color-dependent plot styles. If this list is not grayed out, the drawing can use
named plot styles.
Plotting in color
Plotting the colors that you see on-screen requires no special tricks. In the
absence of a plot style table (that is, if you selected None from the drop-down
list in the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area in the Plot dialog box),
AutoCAD sends color information as it appears on-screen to the plotter. As
long as your output device can plot in color, what you see should be what
you get.
If you attach a plot style table to the tab that you’re plotting (as described in
the previous section), you can — if you really want to — map screen colors
to different plotted colors. In most cases, you don’t want that kind of confu-
sion. Instead, leave the Color property in the plot style table set to Use
Object Color.
If your goal is not to plot color, make sure that you set the Color property for all
plot styles to Black. If you try to plot colors on a monochrome device, you may
find that objects appear in various shades of gray, like in a black and white
newspaper photograph, with lighter colors mapped to lighter shades of gray
and darker colors to darker shades of gray. This process of mapping colors to
shades of gray is called monochrome dithering, and it usually is not what you
want in a CAD drawing. To override it, use the Plot Style Table Editor, as
described in the section “Creating plot styles,” earlier in this chapter, to set the
Color option for all colors to Black (the default setting is Use Object Color). If
you don’t already have a plot style table that you want to use, choose mono-
chrome.ctb (for color-based plot styles) or monochrome.stb (for named plot
styles) from the drop-down list in the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) are of
the Plot dialog box, both of which come with AutoCAD.

To see the full range of AutoCAD colors available on your plotter, or to see
how a particular plot style table affects plotting, open and then plot the file
C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2006\Sample\Plot Screening and Fill
Patterns.dwg. The Screening 100% layout in this drawing contains color
swatches for all 255 AutoCAD colors.
It’s a (Page) Setup!
Page setups specify the plotter, paper size, and other plot settings that you
use to plot a particular tab of a particular drawing. AutoCAD maintains sepa-
rate page setups for model space and for each paper space model layout
(that is, for each tab you see in the drawing area). When you click the Apply
to Layout button in the Plot dialog box (or select the Save Changes to Layout
check box and then click OK to plot), AutoCAD stores the current plot set-
tings as the page setup for the current tab.
295
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens
When in doubt, send it out
Whether you plot to scale or not, with different
lineweights or not, in color or not, consider
using a service bureau for some of your plotting.
In-house plotting on your office’s output devices
is great for small check plots on faster laser or
inkjet printers. Large-format plotting, on the
other hand, can be slow and time consuming. 
If you need to plot lots of drawings, you may 
find yourself spending an afternoon loading
paper, replenishing ink cartridges, and trimming
sheets.
Good plotting service bureaus have big, fast,
expensive plotters that you can only dream
about owning. Also, they’re responsible for
babysitting those fancy devices, feeding them,
and fixing them. As a bonus, service bureaus
can make blueline prints from your plots, if you
need to distribute hard-copy sets to other
people.
The only downside is that you need to coordi-
nate with a service bureau to make sure it gets
what it needs from you and can deliver the kinds
of plots you need. Some service bureaus plot
directly from your DWG files, while others ask
you to make PLT (plot) files. Some service
bureaus specialize in color plotting, while
others are more comfortable with monochrome
plotting and making blueline copies.
When you’re choosing a service bureau, look
for one that traditionally has served drafters,
architects, and engineers. These service
bureaus tend to be more knowledgeable about
AutoCAD, and they should have more plotting
expertise than the desktop publishing, printing,
and copying shops.
Whomever you choose, do some test plots well
before the day when that important set of draw-
ings is due. Talk to the plotting people and get a
copy of their plotting instructions. Have the ser-
vice bureau create some plots of a couple of
your typical drawings and make sure they look
the way you want them to.
If you do lots of plotting with a service bureau,
look into whether you can charge it to your
clients as an expense (just like bluelines or
copying).

You also can give page setups names and save them. The advantage of doing
so is that you can switch quickly between different plot settings and copy
plot settings from one drawing tab to another. Named page setups are stored
with each drawing, but you can copy them from another drawing into the 
current one with the Page Setup Manager dialog box (described later in this
section).
If you want to get fancier, you can create named page setups in order to plot
the same layout (or the model tab) in different ways, or to copy plot settings
from one tab to another or one drawing to another. Click the Add button in
the Plot dialog box to create a named page setup from the current plot set-
tings. After you create a named page setup, you can restore its plot settings
by choosing it from the Page Setup Name drop-down list.
For even greater control, choose File➪Page Setup Manager to create, change,
and copy page setups. In the Page Setup Manager dialog box, shown in Figure
12-9, you can create new page setups and modify existing ones. Click the
Modify button to open the Page Setup dialog box, which is almost identical to
the Plot dialog box. The primary difference is that you’re changing plot set-
tings rather than actually plotting. The Set Current button copies the page
setup that you’ve selected on the Page Setups list to the current layout tab.
With the Import button, you can copy a layout from another drawing or draw-
ing template (DWT) file.

Continuing the Plot Dialog
In previous sections of this chapter, we cover most of the important options
in the Plot dialog box. This section reveals a few more fine points that will
make your plotting life easier. We don’t cover every minute, obscure, useful-
only-at-cocktail party-discussions detail. (And if this sounds like your kind of
cocktail party, remind us that we’re busy that night.) We do point out some
occasionally useful options that will increase your vocabulary when you’re
communicating with the Plot dialog box.
Use the Plot dialog box’s quick help to find out more about any part of the
dialog box: 
1. Click the question mark next to the close button in the dialog box’s
title bar. 
2. Point the cursor at the part of the dialog box that confuses you and
click. 
3. Click the Help button at the bottom of the dialog box if the pop-up
help isn’t enough.
Quickstart help provides information on procedures and concepts for selected
topics in AutoCAD 2006. In the Plot dialog box, click Learn about Plotting for
additional information.
 Printer/Plotter: As we describe in the section “Configure it out,” earlier
in this chapter, you use the Name drop-down list to select the Windows
system printer or nonsystem driver configuration that you want to use
for plotting.
Clicking the Properties button opens the Plotter Configuration Editor
dialog box, with which you can change media (type of paper) and other
properties that are unique to the currently selected plotter or printer. In
particular, you can define custom paper sizes.
As if AutoCAD’s Plot dialog box settings weren’t overwhelming enough,
depending on your plot device, you may also have to deal with the
Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box. Some plotter drivers hide impor-
tant settings in this dialog box. To access them, you typically click the
Custom Properties button near the bottom of the Plotter Configuration
Editor dialog box. (For example, if you’re using the enhanced Windows
system driver for HP plotters, available at www.designjet.hp.com, you
can click the Custom Properties button and then the More Sizes button
to specify which paper sizes are available to you on the Paper Size drop-
down list of the main Plot dialog box.)
297
Chapter 12: The Plot Thickens

To make matters even more confusing, if you make any changes in the
Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box, AutoCAD prompts you to save
the changes to a separate PC3 file. You should choose Save Changes to
the Following File (that is, create a new AutoCAD-specific configuration
that includes the revised settings) and type a configuration name that
you’ll recognize later. When you want to plot with custom settings,
remember to choose the AutoCAD-specific PC3 configuration near the
end of the Printer/Plotter Name drop-down list, and not the original
Windows system printer configuration near the beginning of the list.
 Plot to File: If you need to plot to a file rather than directly to your plot-
ter or network printer queue, select the Plot to File option. When you
click OK to plot, AutoCAD asks you for a plot file name and location.
This option is especially useful when you want to use the ePlot feature
to publish a DWF file on a Web site. You also may need to use this option
to create files to send to a plotting service bureau.
 Plot Stamp On: Use this option to turn on and off and configure the con-
tents of a text string that AutoCAD adds automatically to the corner of
each plot. The plot stamp can include useful information such as the
drawing filename and plot date and time.
 Plot Area: Specify the area of the drawing to plot. Your choices include
Display, Extents, and Window, regardless of whether you’re plotting a
paper space layout or the model space tab. If you defined named views
in the drawing, AutoCAD adds a View option. The additional choice is
Layout for a paper space layout tab or Limits for the model space tab.
• Display means the drawing as it’s currently displayed in the draw-
ing window (including any white space — or black space — around
the drawing objects). 
• Extents means the rectangular area containing all the objects in the
drawing. 
• Limits means the model space area that you specified (or should
have specified) when you set up the drawing, See Chapter 4 for
details. 
• Window means a rectangular area that you specify.
• View means a named view, which you select from the drop-down
list (Chapter 8 describes named views and how to create them). 
Usually, you’ll choose to plot Layout in paper space. For model space,
the choice depends on whether the drawing was set up properly and
what you want to plot. If you set limits properly, as we suggest in
Chapter 4, then plot Limits in order to get the whole drawing area. If
you’re trying to plot a drawing in which the limits weren’t set properly,
try Extents instead. Use Window or View if you want to plot just a por-
tion of model space.
298
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 

 Plot Offset: A plot offset of X=0 and Y=0 positions the plot at the lower-left
corner of the plottable area. If you want to move the plot from this default
position on the paper, enter nonzero numbers or select the Center the
Plot check box. (The Center the Plot check box is available only when you
haven’t selected Layout from the What to Plot drop-down list.)
 Shaded Viewport Options: If your drawing includes viewports showing
shaded or rendered 3D models, use this area to control the plotted
appearance.
 Plot Options: The Plot Object Lineweights and the Plot with Plot Styles
check boxes control whether AutoCAD uses the features described in
the “Plotting with style” and “Plotting through thick and thin” sections,
earlier in this chapter.
The Hide Paperspace Objects check box controls whether AutoCAD
hides objects that are behind other objects when a 3D model is dis-
played in a viewport. If your drawing is entirely 2D, then this option
doesn’t matter. If your drawing includes 3D objects, then selecting this
setting is like applying the 3DOrbit command’s Hidden option to the
plot. Look up “3DORBIT command” on the Index tab in the AutoCAD
online help system for more information. 
 Plot Upside-Down: Select this check box if you want to rotate the plot
180 degrees on the paper (a handy option for plotting in the southern
hemisphere, or for avoiding having to cock your head at an uncomfort-
able angle as you watch plots come out of the plotter).
AutoCAD normally generates plots in the foreground — that is, the plotting
process takes over the program for the entire time that the program is creat-
ing the plot. AutoCAD 2006 includes a background plotting feature that
returns control of the program to you more quickly. If you have a reasonably
fast computer with adequate memory, turn on this feature in the Options
dialog box: Choose Tools➪Options, click the Plot and Publish tab, and select
Plotting in the Background Processing Options area.
If you want to automate plotting for a batch of drawings, check out Chapter 15.
Troubles with Plotting
No matter how many times you read this chapter or how carefully you study
the AutoCAD documentation, you’ll occasionally run into plotting problems.
You’re especially likely to encounter problems when trying to plot other
people’s drawings because you don’t always know what plotting conventions
they had in mind. (Plotting conventions aren’t where spies meet; they’re a
standardized approach to plotting issues.) Table 12-1 describes some of the
more common plotting problems and solutions.

fter you get the lines and text right, you may be justi-
fied in thinking that your work in AutoCAD is done.
But AutoCAD enables you to do so much more! Blocks and
external references help you manage data within drawings,
between drawings, and across a network. AutoCAD’s sheet
sets feature may redefine how people organize drawings on
larger, multisheet projects, so this part devotes a new chap-
ter to it. If you plan to share drawings (whether among
your own projects, with people in your office, or with folks
in other companies), you need to think about consistency
in presentation and drawing organization — in other words,
CAD standards. The Internet is the biggest ongoing swap
meet in human history, and AutoCAD offers some unique
trading possibilities — and potential pitfalls — via e-mail
and the Web. With the information in this part, you’ll be
teaching AutoCAD how to give and receive in no time.

hapter 7 shows you how to copy objects within a drawing or even
to another drawing. That’s one way to use CAD to improve drafting 
efficiency. You can copy a DWG file and then modify it to create a similar
drawing — an even better productivity-booster, as long as you’re in the habit
of making similar drawings. But all those are baby steps compared to the
techniques that we cover in this chapter: treating drawings, parts of draw-
ings, and raster images as reusable and updateable modules. If you want to
make drafting production more efficient with CAD, then you want to know
how to use blocks, xrefs, and raster files.
A block is a collection of objects grouped together to form a single object.
You can insert this collection more than once in the same drawing, and when
you do, all instances of the block remain identical, even after you change the
block definition. Although a block lives within a specific drawing, you can
transfer copies of it into other drawings. You can add fill-in-the-blank text
fields called attributes to blocks.
The most significant new feature in AutoCAD 2006 is undoubtedly dynamic
blocks. Unlike a regular block, in which every instance of a particular block is
geometrically identical, each instance of a dynamic block can display geomet-
ric variations. For example, you can insert one furniture block three times
and have one instance display as a sofa, one as a loveseat, and one as an arm-
chair. We look more closely at block authoring — the process for creating and
editing dynamic blocks — in this chapter.

This is one of those places where AutoCAD LT users should remind them-
selves of how much money they saved by not buying the full version. You
need full AutoCAD to define dynamic blocks, but AutoCAD LT users can view,
print, insert, and manipulate already-created dynamic blocks.
An external reference, or xref, is like an industrial-strength block. An external
reference is a pointer to a separate drawing outside the drawing you’re work-
ing on. The referenced drawing appears on-screen and on plots as part of
your drawing, but it continues to live as a separate document on your hard
disk. If you edit the externally referenced drawing, the appearance of the
drawing changes in all drawings that reference it.
A raster file (also called a bitmap file) stores a graphical image as a series of
dots. Raster files are good for storing photographs, logos, and other images,
whereas CAD vector files are good for storing geometrical objects such as
lines and arcs, along with text and other annotations for describing the geom-
etry. Sometimes it’s handy to combine raster images with CAD vector files,
and AutoCAD’s IMage command makes the process straightforward.
Blocks, external references, and raster images enable you to reuse your work
and the work of others, giving you the potential to save tremendous amounts
of time — or to cause tremendous problems if you change a file on which
other peoples’ drawings depend. Use these features when you can to save
time, but do so in an organized and careful way so as to avoid problems.
The way you use blocks and especially xrefs will depend a lot on the profes-
sion and office in which you work. Some disciplines and companies use these
drawing organization features heavily and in a highly organized way, while
others don’t. Ask your colleagues what the local customs are and follow them.
Rocking with Blocks
First, a little more block theory and then you can rock right into those blocks.
To use a block in a drawing, you need two things: a block definition and one
or more block inserts. AutoCAD doesn’t always make the distinction between
these two things very clear, but you need to understand the difference to
avoid terminal confusion about blocks. (Maybe this syndrome should be
called blockheadedness?)
A block definition lives in an invisible area of your drawing file called the
block table. (It’s one of those symbol tables that we describe in Chapter 5.)
The block table is like a book of graphical recipes for making different kinds
304
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

of blocks. Each block definition is like a recipe for making one kind of block.
When you insert a block, as described later in this chapter, AutoCAD creates
a special object called a block insert. The insert points to the recipe and tells
AutoCAD, “Hey, draw me according to the instructions in this recipe!”
Although a block may look like a collection of objects stored together and
given a name, it’s really a graphical recipe (the block definition) plus one or
more pointers to that recipe (one or more block inserts). Each time you
insert a particular block, you create another pointer to the same recipe.
The advantages of blocks include:
 Grouping objects together when they belong together logically. You
can draw a screw using lines and arcs, and then make a block definition
out of all these objects. When you insert the screw block, AutoCAD
treats it as a single object for purposes of copying, moving, and so on.
 Saving time and reducing errors. Inserting a block is, of course, much
quicker than redrawing the same geometry again. And the less geometry
you draw from scratch, the less opportunity there is to make a mistake.
 Efficiency of storage when you reuse the same block repeatedly. If you
insert the same screw block 15 times in a drawing, AutoCAD stores the
detailed block definition only once. The 15 block inserts that point to
the block definition take up much less disk space than 15 copies of all
the lines, polylines, and arcs.
 The ability to edit all instances of a symbol in a drawing simply by
modifying a single block definition. This one is a biggie. If you decide
that your design requires a different kind of screw, you simply redefine
the screw’s block definition. With this new recipe, AutoCAD then
replaces all 15 screws automatically. That’s a heck of a lot faster than
erasing and recopying 15 screws!
 Varying the appearance of block inserts using AutoCAD 2006’s dynamic
blocks feature. This one is an even bigger biggie. If your design requires
a different kind of screw, you simply change the view of the screw to the
other kind (assuming, of course, you’ve defined your screw as a dynamic
block). Every instance of the screw in the drawing could show a different
kind of screw. And that’s a heck of a lot more efficient than creating 15 dif-
ferent block definitions!
Blocks aren’t as great for drawing elements used in multiple drawings, how-
ever, especially in a situation where several people are working on and shar-
ing parts of drawings with one another. That’s because blocks, after they get
into multiple drawings, stay in each drawing; a later modification to a block
definition in one drawing does not automatically modify all the other draw-
ings that use that block. If you use a block with your company’s logo in a
305
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

number of drawings and then you decide to change the logo, you must make
the change within each drawing that uses the block.
External references enable you to modify multiple drawings from the original
referenced drawing. You can find out more about external references in the
section “Going External,” later in this chapter.
If all you need to do is make some objects into a group so that you can more
easily select them for copying, moving, and so on, use the AutoCAD group fea-
ture. Type Group and press Enter to open the Group Manager dialog box.
Then select some objects, click the Create Group button, and type a name for
the group. When you’re editing drawings containing groups, press Ctrl+H to
toggle “group-ness” on or off. If you’ve toggled “group-ness” on, picking any
object in a group selects all objects in the group. If you’ve toggled it off, pick-
ing an object selects only that object, even if it happens to be a member of
a group.
Creating block definitions
To create a block definition from objects in the current drawing, use the
Block Definition dialog box. (The other way to create a block definition is by
inserting another drawing file into your current drawing as a block, which we
explain in the next section.) The following steps show you how to create a

Layers matter when you create the objects that make up a block. Block
geometry created on most layers retains the characteristics, such as
color and linetype, of those layers. But if you create a block using geom-
etry on Layer 0, that geometry has no characteristics, such as color and
linetype of its own; chameleonlike, it takes on the features of the layer
into which it’s inserted.
2. Type the block definition’s name in the Name text box.
If you type the name of an existing block definition, AutoCAD replaces
that block definition with the new group of objects you select. This
process is called block redefinition.
To see a list of the names of all the current blocks in your drawing, pull
down the Name list.
3. Specify the base point, also known as the insertion point, of the block,
using either of the following methods:
• Enter the coordinates of the insertion point in the X, Y, and Z text
boxes.
• Click the Pick Point button and then select a point on the screen.
(In this case, use an object snap or other precision technique, as
described in Chapter 5, to grab a specific point on one of the
block’s objects.)
The base point is the point on the block by which you insert it later, as
we describe in the next section.
Use an obvious and consistent point on the group of objects for the base
point, such as the lower-left corner, so that you know what to expect
when you insert the block.
4. Click the Select Objects button and then select the objects that you
want as part of the block.
AutoCAD uses the selected objects to create a block definition and dis-
plays an icon showing those objects next to the block name. Figure 13-2
shows the base point and group of selected objects during the process
of creating a new block definition.
5. Select a radio button to tell AutoCAD what to do with the objects used
to define the block: Retain them in place, Convert them into a block
instance, or Delete them.
The default choice, Convert to Block, is usually the best. See Step 9 for a
description of what happens with each choice.
6. Specify the Insert units to which the block will be scaled in the Block
Unit drop-down list.
When you or someone else drags the block from one drawing into another
via the DesignCenter palette (see Chapter 5) or Tool Palette (described
later in this chapter), the units you specify here and the units of the draw-
ing you’re dragging into will control the default insertion scale factor.
307
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

Two new features in AutoCAD 2006’s Block dialog box give you additional
control over what happens to your blocks as they’re inserted. If the Scale
Uniformly check box is selected, blocks can’t be inserted with differing
x, y, or z scale factors. If the Allow Exploding check box is deselected,
blocks can’t be exploded during or after their insertion in a drawing.
7. Enter a description for the block in the Description text area.
Now is the time to think like a database manager and enter a useful
description that will identify the block to yourself and others.
8. Make sure that the Open in Block Editor check box is unchecked.
You don’t need to use the Edit Block Definition dialog box if you’re not
going to add dynamic features to the block. We look at defining dynamic
blocks later in the chapter.
9. Click OK to complete the block definition process.
If you typed the name of an existing block definition in Step 2, AutoCAD
warns you that you’ll redefine that block definition. Click Yes to redefine,
which will update all instances of the block in the current drawing to
match the changed block definition.

AutoCAD stores the block definition in the current drawing’s block
table. If you selected the Convert to Block radio button (the default) in
Step 5, AutoCAD also creates a block insert pointing to the new block
definition — the objects look the same on-screen, but now they’re an
instance of the block rather than existing as separate objects. If you
selected the Retain radio button, the objects remain in place but aren’t
converted into a block insert — they stay individual objects with no con-
nection to the new block definition. If you selected the Delete radio
button, the objects disappear (but the block definition still gets created).
You can include in a block definition a special kind of variable text object
called an attribute definition. When you insert a block that contains one or
more attribute definitions, AutoCAD prompts you to fill in values for the text
fields. Attributes are useful for variable title block information (sheet number,
sheet title, and so on) and symbols that contain different codes or call-outs.
We describe how to create and use attribute definitions later in this chapter.
Keep your common symbol drawings in one or more specific folders that you
set aside just for that purpose. You may want to use one of the following tech-
niques to develop a block library of symbols that you use frequently:
 Create a separate DWG file for each symbol (using Wblock, or simply by
drawing each one in a new drawing). 
 Store a bunch of symbols as block definitions in one drawing and use
DesignCenter to import block definitions from this drawing when you
need them. 
309
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids
Block and Wblock
The Block command, which opens the Block
Definition dialog box, is great for use within a
drawing, but what if you want to use the block
definition in multiple drawings? The easiest
method is to use DesignCenter to copy a block
definition from one drawing to another, as
described in Chapter 5.
Another method involves the Wblock and Insert
commands. We don’t cover this method here
because it’s less intuitive than using
DesignCenter. But you may hear AutoCAD
drafters talk about “wblocking” part of a draw-
ing. So that you can keep these block-y names
straight
 The Block command creates a block defin-
ition from objects in the current drawing.
 The Wblock command creates a new DWG
file from objects in the current drawing,
or from a block definition in the current
drawing.

Inserting blocks
AutoCAD provides a number of ways to insert a block, but the most com-
monly used and most flexible is the Insert dialog box. Here’s the procedure
for inserting a block:
1. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 5.
It’s a good idea to insert each block on a layer that has something to do
with its geometry or purpose: 
• If all the objects in the block definition reside on one layer, then it’s
usually best to insert the block on that layer. 
• If the block geometry spans several layers, choose one of them to
insert the block on.
If any of the block definition’s geometry was created on Layer 0, then
that geometry will inherit the color, linetype, and other object proper-
ties of the layer that you insert the block on. It’s like the chameleon
changing color to match its surroundings or a politician changing his
position to match the day’s opinion polls.
2. Click the Insert Block button on the Draw toolbar.
The Insert dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-3.
3. Enter the block definition name or external filename by using one of
the following methods:
• Use the Name drop-down list to select from a list of block defini-
tions in the current drawing.
• Click the Browse button to select an external DWG file and have
AutoCAD create a block definition from it.
Figure 13-3:
The Insert
dialog box.
310
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

You can use an external drawing to replace a block definition in your
current drawing. If you click Browse and choose a file whose name
matches the name of a block definition that’s already in your drawing,
AutoCAD warns you and then updates the block definition in your draw-
ing with the current contents of the external file. This process is called
block redefinition, and as described in Steps 2 and 9 in the “Creating
block definitions” section, AutoCAD automatically updates all the block
inserts that point to the block definition.
4. Enter the insertion point, scale, and rotation angle of the block.
You can either select the Specify On-Screen check box in each area to
specify the parameters on-screen at the command prompt, or type the
values you want in the Insertion Point, Scale, and Rotation text boxes.
Check the Uniform Scale check box to constrain the X, Y, and Z scaling
parameters to the same value (which in almost all cases you want).
5. If you want AutoCAD to create a copy of the individual objects in the
block instead of a block insert that points to the block definition,
select the Explode check box.
6. Click OK.
7. If you checked the Specify On-Screen check box for the insertion
point, scale, or rotation angle, answer the prompts on the command
line to specify these parameters.
After you insert a block, all the objects displayed in the block insert behave
as a single object. When you select any object in the block insert, AutoCAD
highlights all the objects in it.
Another way to insert a block is to drag a DWG file’s name from Windows
Explorer and drop it anywhere in the current drawing window. AutoCAD then
prompts you to choose an insertion point and optionally change the default
scale factor and rotation angle. Similarly, you can drag a block definition’s
name from the Blocks section of the DesignCenter palette and drop it into
the current drawing window. (Chapter 5 describes DesignCenter.)
AutoCAD provides one additional way of inserting blocks: the Tool Palette,
which is described in Chapter 2. As is true of using Tool Palette for hatching
(Chapter 11), you first must create and configure appropriate tools — that is,
swatches. The easiest method is right-clicking a drawing in DesignCenter and
choosing Create Tool Palette. A new page is added to the Tool Palette area
containing all the block definitions from the drawing that you right-clicked.
Simply click and drag a tool to insert its corresponding block into a drawing.
As with hatching, you don’t get the chance to specify a different insertion
scale. You also can’t use all of AutoCAD’s precision tools to specify the inser-
tion point precisely, so you may need to move the block into place after insert-
ing it. We recommend that you first master the other block insertion methods
311
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

described in this chapter — especially the Insert dialog box and DesignCenter
palette. Then if you find yourself inserting the same blocks frequently, con-
sider creating a Tool Palette containing them. See “tool palettes, adding draw-
ings from” in the AutoCAD online help system for more information.
Be careful when inserting one drawing into another. If the host (or parent)
drawing and the inserted (or child) drawing have different definitions for
layers that share the same name, the objects in the child drawing take on the
layer characteristics of the parent drawing. For example, if you insert a draw-
ing with lines on a layer called Walls that’s blue and dashed into a drawing
with a layer called Walls that’s red and continuous, the inserted lines on the
wall layer will turn red and continuous after they’re inserted. The same rules
apply to linetypes, text styles, dimension styles, and block definitions that
are nested inside the drawing you’re inserting.
If you need to modify a block definition after you’ve inserted one or more
instances of it, use the REFEDIT command (Modify➪Xref and Block Editing➪
Edit Reference In-Place). Look up “REFEDIT” in the AutoCAD online help
system.
Attributes: Fill-in-the-blank blocks
You may think of attributes as the good (or bad) qualities of your significant
other, but in AutoCAD, attributes are fill-in-the-blank text fields that you can
add to your blocks. When you create a block definition and then insert it sev-
eral times in a drawing, all the ordinary geometry (lines, circles, regular text
strings, and so on) in all the instances are exactly identical. Attributes pro-
vide a little more flexibility in the form of text strings that can be different in
each block insert.
For example, suppose that you frequently designate parts in your drawings
by labeling them with a distinct number or letter in a circle for each part. If
you want to create a block for this symbol, you can’t simply draw the number
or letter as regular text using the mText or TEXT command. If you create a
block definition with a regular text object (for example, the letter A), the text
string will be the same in every instance of the block (always the letter A).
That’s not much help in distinguishing the parts!
Instead, you create an attribute definition, which acts as a placeholder for a
text string that can vary each time you insert the block. You include the
attribute definition when you create the block definition (as we demonstrate
in the “Creating block definitions” section, earlier in this chapter). Then each
time you insert the block, AutoCAD prompts you to fill in an attribute value
for each attribute definition.
312
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

The AutoCAD documentation and dialog boxes often use the term attribute to
refer indiscriminately to an attribute definition or an attribute value. We attribute
a lot of the confusion about attributes to this sloppiness. Just remember that
an attribute definition is the text field or placeholder in the block definition,
while an attribute value is the specific text string that you type when you insert
the block.
If you’ve worked with databases, the correspondences in Table 13-1 between
AutoCAD objects (blocks and attributes) and database terminology may help
you understand the concept.

Attribute definitions
You use the Attribute Definition dialog box to create attribute definitions
(clever, huh?). The procedure is similar to creating a text string, except that
you must supply a little more information. Create attribute definitions with
the following steps:
1. Change to the layer on which you want to create the attribute 
definition.
2. Choose Draw➪Block➪Define Attributes to run the ATTDEF command.
The Attribute Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-4.
You rarely need to use any of the Mode settings (Invisible, Constant,
Verify, or Preset). Just leave them unchecked. If you’re curious about
what the modes do, use the dialog box help to find out more.
3. In the Attribute area, type the Tag (database field name), Prompt (user
prompt), and Value (default value).
The name you type into the Tag text box can’t contain any spaces. The
Prompt and Value text boxes may contain spaces.
Attribute values can include automatically updating fields, such as date,
filename, or system variable setting. Click the Insert Field button to 
the right of the Value text box to insert a field. See Chapter 9 for more
information.
313
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

4. In the Text Options area, specify the Justification, Text Style, Height,
and Rotation.
The text properties for attribute definitions are the same as those for
single-line text objects — see Chapter 9.
5. Select Specify On-screen to choose an insertion point for the attribute
definition.
An attribute definition’s insertion point is like a text string’s base point.
Remember to use snap, object snap, or another precision tool if you
want the eventual attribute values to be located at a precise point.
6. Click OK to create the attribute definition.
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 for any additional attribute definitions.
If you need to create a series of attribute definitions in neat rows, create
the first one using Steps 1 through 6, and then select the Align below
Previous Attribute Definition check box for the subsequent definitions.
To make a series of non-adjacent attributes, create the first one using
Steps 1 through 6, and then copy the first attribute definition and edit
the copy with the Properties palette.
You can prevent your attributes from being dragged around the block by
selecting the Lock Position in Block check box in the Attribute Definition
dialog box.
Block definition containing attribute definitions
After you create one or more attribute definitions — and any other geometry
that you want to include in the block — you’re ready to create a block defini-
tion that contains them. Follow the steps in the section “Creating block defin-
itions,” earlier in this chapter.
Figure 13-4:
The
Attribute
Definition
dialog box.
314
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

At Step 4 in the section “Creating block definitions,” select any attribute defi-
nitions first before you select the other geometry. Select each attribute defini-
tion one-by-one (clicking on each attribute definition rather than selecting
multiple attributes with a selection window), in the order that you want the
attribute value prompts to appear in the Enter Attributes dialog box (see
Figure 13-5). If you don’t select the attributes one by one, your block and
attributes will still work, but the order of the attribute prompts in the Enter
Attributes dialog box may not be what you want.
You can use the Block Attribute Manager (choose Modify➪Object➪Attribute➪
Block Attribute Manager) to reorder the attribute definitions in a block defini-
tion. You also can use this dialog box to edit other attribute definition settings,
such as the prompt, text style, or layer. If you get tired of traversing four menu
picks to get to this command, you can type the command name — BATTMAN
(Block ATTribute MANager) — instead. It’s probably only a matter of time
before Autodesk adds a ROBIN (ReOrder Block INsert) command. . . .
Attributes are particularly useful for creating a title block. Use regular AutoCAD
commands, including mText or TEXT, to draw the parts of the title block that
will remain the same in all drawings. Then use ATTDEF to create an attribute
for each text string in the drawing that might change on different sheets.
Insert a block containing attribute definitions
After you create a block definition that contains attribute definitions, you
insert it just like any other block. Follow the steps in the section “Inserting
blocks,” earlier in this chapter. At the end of the steps, AutoCAD should dis-
play the Enter Attributes dialog box, shown in Figure 13-5. The dialog box
contains one row for each of the attribute definitions and has any default
values filled in. You simply edit the values and then click OK.
Figure 13-5:
The Enter
Attributes
dialog box.
315
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

The ATTDIA (ATTribute DIAlog box) system variable controls whether
AutoCAD prompts for attribute values in a dialog box (ATTDIA=1) or at the
command line (ATTDIA=0). If you insert a block and see command line
prompts for each attribute value, type a value and press Enter for each
attribute value. When you return to the Command prompt, type ATTDIA,
press Enter, type 1, and press Enter again. When you insert blocks with
attributes in this drawing in the future, AutoCAD displays the Enter
Attributes dialog box instead of prompting you at the command line.
Edit attribute values
After you insert a block that contains attributes, you can edit the individual
attributes in that block insert with the EATTEDIT command (Enhanced
ATTtribute EDIT — nothing to do with eating). Choose Modify➪Object➪
Attribute➪Single and click on any object in the block insert. AutoCAD dis-
plays the Enhanced Attribute Editor dialog box with the current attribute
values, as shown in Figure 13-6. The most common attribute editing opera-
tion is to edit the text value — that is, the text string that appears in the
block insert. You also can change properties of the attributes, such as layer
and text style.
Many people use attributes in the way we’ve described so far — as fill-in-the-
blank text fields in blocks. But attributes also can serve as data extraction
tools. For example, you can export attribute values, such as part numbers
and quantities, to a text, spreadsheet, or database file for analysis or report-
ing. The Attribute Extraction wizard (Tools➪Attribute Extraction) makes the
process fairly straightforward. If you’re hungry to find out more, look up
“EATTEXT (Enhanced ATTribute EXTtract) command” in the AutoCAD online
help system.
In AutoCAD 2006, attribute data from the current drawing or from sheet sets
can also be extracted to a table in an AutoCAD drawing. We describe tables in
Chapter 9. For more information on sheet sets, see Chapter 14.

Exploding blocks
Apart from AutoCAD 2006’s dynamic blocks, the objects in each block insert
act like a well-honed marching squadron: If you move or otherwise edit one
object in the block insert, all objects move or change in the same way. Usually
this cohesion is an advantage, but occasionally you need to break up the
squadron in order to modify one object without affecting the others.
To explode a block insert into individual objects, click Explode (the firecracker
button) on the Modify toolbar and then select the block insert. When you
explode a block insert, AutoCAD replaces it with all the objects — lines, poly-
lines, arcs, and so on — specified in the block definition. You then can edit the
objects or perhaps use them to make more block definitions.
317
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids
Purging unused block definitions
Each block definition slightly increases the size
of your DWG file, as do other named objects
such as layers, text styles, and dimension styles.
If you delete (or explode) all the block inserts that
point to a particular block definition, then that
block definition no longer serves any purpose.
You should run the PUrge command periodically
in each drawing and purge unused block defin-
itions and other named objects. Choose File➪
Drawing Utilities➪Purge to display the Purge
dialog box, as shown in the following figure.
Click the Purge All button in order to purge all
unused named objects in the current drawing.

Don’t make a habit of exploding blocks cavalierly, especially if you’re working
in someone else’s drawing and aren’t sure why the objects are organized as
blocks. Most people use blocks for a reason, and if you go around exploding
them left and right, you’re likely to be treated the same way that anyone who
blows up a lot of things gets treated.
If you explode a block that contains attributes, the attribute values change
back to attribute definitions. This usually isn’t the sort of change that you
want. If you really need to explode the block insert, you’ll probably want to
erase the attribute definitions and draw regular text strings in their place. If
you’ve installed the AutoCAD Express Tools (not in AutoCAD LT), you can
perform this task automatically with the BURST command (Express➪Blocks➪
Explode Attributes to Text).
Theme and variations: Dynamic blocks
If you’re using the full version of AutoCAD 2006, you can add variety to your
blocks by making them dynamic. (And if you’re using AutoCAD LT, you can
dynamically benefit from the authorship of others.) The two most useful
applications for dynamic blocks are multiple presentations of similar objects
and manipulation of components within individual block inserts.
There’s no question that AutoCAD 2006’s dynamic blocks feature gives a
great deal of flexibility to block creation and insertion. But it’s also a very
complicated system, with its own set of commands and system variables. We
recommend that you make yourself very familiar with the regular block cre-
ation and insertion techniques we describe in the previous sections before
you tackle dynamic blocks.
Spend some time planning your dynamic blocks. Sketch out the geometry
for each variation in appearance (or visibility state) and decide where the
common base point should be. Unless you’re a lot smarter than we are, you’ll
probably find that creating dynamic blocks is complex enough without trying
to design your blocks as you go.
Now you see it . . .
If your drawing shows six different kinds of windows, you need to create six
different standard blocks to represent them all. In AutoCAD 2006, you can
create a single block, and define visibility states to cover all six different types.
The following steps show you how to make your blocks do double (or sextu-
ple?) duty using the Edit Block Definition dialog box:
1. Open a drawing that contains some blocks definitions you’d like to
combine, or draw some simple geometry to make some similar types
of object.
318
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

You can create dynamic blocks from scratch, or you can work with exist-
ing standard (that is, non-dynamic) block definitions. Figure 13-7 shows
a drawing with three non-dynamic blocks. 
2. Choose Tools➪Block Edit to open the Edit Block Definition dialog box.
3. Specify a new block name or click <Current Drawing>, and then click
OK to display the Block Editor window.
The Block Editor is a special authoring environment with its own set of
palettes, a toolbar, and a passel of command-line commands. You also
have access to the rest of AutoCAD’s toolbars, so you can draw and edit
just like you’re in the regular drawing window.
If you enter a new block name, AutoCAD displays an empty block-
authoring environment where you draw geometry or insert existing
blocks. If you instead select <Current Drawing>, AutoCAD places all
drawing objects inside the block-authoring environment.
4. Create some geometry for the first visibility state, or choose Draw➪
Insert and select an existing block definition to serve as the first visi-
bility state. 
When creating geometry from scratch, pay attention to where the
common base point should be. Although you use different blocks to
assemble a multiple view block, they should all have the same base
point (0,0 is a good one for blocks). You don’t want your chairs jumping
around between different insertion points!
5. If you inserted an existing block in Step 4, uncheck all three Specify
On-Screen check boxes, make sure that the Explode check box is not
checked, and then click OK.

6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5, drawing or inserting all the necessary geometry.
At this point, your drawing screen may look pretty strange (see Figure

7. Click the Parameters tab of the Block Authoring palettes, and then
click Visibility Parameter. 
If the Block Authoring palettes are not open, click the Authoring Palettes
button on the Block Authoring toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the parameter location.
8. Click to place the parameter marker somewhere other than the base
point location you chose in Step 4.
The parameter location you specify will be the spot on the block where
the dynamic block option grip will be displayed. It’s not crucial where you
locate this point, but try to pick a sensible location on the object. If you
specify the same point for the parameter location as the base point for the
block, you may have a hard time selecting the dynamic option grip.

As shown in Figure 13-8, the label Visibility appears next to the visibility
parameter marker, and a yellow Alert symbol indicates that no action
has been assigned to the parameter yet. The Visibility States controls
at the right end of the Block Authoring toolbar become active.
10. Click Manage Visibility States on the Block Authoring toolbar. Click
Rename and change VisibilityState0 to something more descriptive.
Click OK.
As is the case with other named objects in AutoCAD, it’s good procedure
to assign useful names rather than accept the default generic labels.
11. On the Block Authoring toolbar, click Make Invisible. At the Select
objects prompt, select the geometry or block inserts that are not asso-
ciated with the current visibility state, and then press Enter.
By default, the invisible objects disappear from the screen. You can view
them in a faded appearance by clicking Visibility Mode on the Block
Authoring toolbar.
12. Click Manage Visibility States again, and then click New to create a
new visibility state. In the New Visibility State dialog box, enter a
descriptive name. Select the Show All Existing Objects in New State
radio button, and then click OK.
All of your geometry should reappear. 
13. Repeat Steps 11 and 12 to create additional visibility states associated
with the remaining geometry or blocks.
The geometry or block insert associated with the last-created visibility
state should be visible on-screen.
14. From the Block Authoring toolbar, click Close Block Editor. Save the
changes to your new block or <Current Drawing>.
AutoCAD closes the block authoring environment and returns to the

Lights! Parameters!! Actions!!!
You can modify the appearance of individual instances of the same block by
defining parameters and actions to move, rotate, flip, or align parts of them.
You can adjust the block’s appearance as you insert it or at any time after-
wards. The following steps show you how to use the Block Editor to add
some action to a block definition: 
321
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

1. Open a drawing that contains some block definitions whose appear-
ance you’d like to spice up a little, or draw some simple geometry that
might make a suitably dynamic block.
Action parameters are most effective in block definitions that contain
groups of related objects — for example, an office desk and chair, or a
furniture arrangement.
2. Choose Tools➪Block Edit or enter the BEdit command to open the
Block Editor.
3. Specify a new block name or click <Current Drawing>, and then
click OK.
4. Create some geometry or insert some blocks. When inserting blocks,
remember to make sure that the Explode check box is not checked,
and then click OK.
Draw the geometry or insert the blocks in a group such that you can
insert the finished arrangement into your drawings — for example,
Figure 13-9 shows the creation of a dynamic block for a coffee shop or
cafeteria.
5. Repeat Step 4 until you’ve drawn all the needed geometry or inserted
all the necessary blocks.
6. Click the Parameters tab of the Block Authoring palettes, and then
click Rotation Parameter. 
If the Block Authoring palettes are not open, click the Authoring Palettes
button on the Block Authoring toolbar.
AutoCAD prompts you to specify the parameter location.
7. Click to place the parameter marker somewhere on the object geome-
try other than the base point location. 
If you specify the same point for the parameter location as the base
point for the block, you may have a hard time selecting the dynamic
option grip.
8. AutoCAD places a parameter marker at the selected point and returns
to the command line.
The parameter marker’s label appears next to the rotation parameter
marker. 
9. Click the Actions tab of the Block Authoring palettes. Click Rotation
Action. Select a base point, a radius, a default rotation angle, and a
location for the action’s label. 
AutoCAD returns to the command prompt. At this point, it’s fine to go
with default values and on-screen pick points.

10. Repeat Steps 6 through 9, trying different parameters and actions. For
example, choose a Point Parameter and a Move Action.
Figure 13-9 shows a set of block components, several of which have
action parameters assigned to them. After the block is inserted, you can
manipulate the components to which you’ve added parameters to vary
the appearance of the blocks. We explain how a little later in this chapter.
11. From the Block Authoring toolbar, click Close Block Editor. Save the
changes to your new block or <Current Drawing>.
AutoCAD closes the block-authoring environment and returns to the

Manipulating dynamic blocks
After a dynamic block has been inserted in a drawing, you can select it and
modify its display through a special set of custom grips. (That’s what AutoCAD
is calling them, so we’re following suit.) 
When you select a standard (that is, non-dynamic) block, you see a single
grip at the insertion point. When you select a dynamic block, you see at least
two — and maybe more — custom grips, as well as the insertion point grip.
The custom grips usually look different than the regular object grips, but not

always, so take care when clicking grips. The following steps show you how
to make your dynamic blocks do the things you just spent all this time teach-
ing them to do:
1. Insert a few blocks that contain some dynamic parameters such as vis-
ibility or action parameters. 
If your block inserts don’t have any action parameters, go to Step 4.
2. Select a block that includes some action parameters.
The block insert displays a number of grips (see Figure 13-10). If the
insert displays only one grip, it is not a dynamic block.
3. Click one of the custom grips — for example, clicking a round grip
opens the rotation parameter of the object. Rotate the component as
required.
4. Select a block that includes a visibility parameter, and then click the
visibility grip. Choose the desired visibility state from the shortcut
menu.
For additional information on manipulating actions and visibility states,
refer to the online help system.
Dynamic blocks, as we’ve suggested more than once, are AutoCAD 2006’s
most powerful new feature and — as we may also have conveyed — one of
its most complicated! The Block Editor palette contains ten selectable para-
meters, eight actions, and twenty parameter sets. We’re thinking of writing a
new book called Block Authoring For Dummies. Until we do, AutoCAD’s online
help system is your best resource for more information on all the possibili-
ties of dynamic blocks. The quickest and most direct way to AutoCAD’s own

help is to click the Learn about Dynamic Blocks button while you’re working
in the Block Editor environment.
Going External
In AutoCAD, an xref, or external reference, is a reference to another, external
file — one outside the current drawing — that you can make act as though
it’s part of your drawing. Technically, a reference is simply a pointer from one
file to another. The xref is the actual pointer, but many people call the combi-
nation of the pointer and the external file the xref.
Drawings that you include as xrefs in other drawings often are called child
drawings. Drawings that contain pointers to the child drawings are called
parent drawings. This family terminology gets a little weird when you realize
that a child drawing can have lots of parent drawings that refer to it — appar-
ently it’s the commune version of family relations. If you find such relation-
ships odd, you can, like the AutoCAD online help system, refer to the parent
drawing as the host drawing. We prefer the terms parent and child, in part
because they’re easily extendable to describing more complex hierarchies,
such as a parent drawing, which xrefs a child drawing, which in turn xrefs a
grandchild drawing.
Xrefs have a big advantage over blocks: If you change a child drawing,
AutoCAD automatically loads the change into all the parent drawings that 
reference the child drawing.
AutoCAD loads all xrefs into the parent drawing each time the parent drawing
is opened. If the child drawing has been changed, AutoCAD automatically
incorporates those changes into the parent drawing.
When you open a drawing containing xrefs, AutoCAD displays a little symbol
(which looks like papers with a binder clip) on the right end of the status bar.
This symbol alerts you to the fact that some of the things you see in the
drawing are actually parts of other, xrefed drawings. If an xref changes while
you have the parent drawing open (because you or someone else opens and
saves the child drawing), the status bar xref symbol displays an External
Reference Files Have Changed balloon notification. (If you want to
change whether the notifications appear and how often AutoCAD checks for
changes, look up XREFNOTIFY and XNOTIFYTIME in the online help.) You can
use the Reload option in the Xref Manager dialog box to show the updated
xrefs. See the “Managing xrefs” section, later in this chapter, for details.
The process of updating xrefs is simplified in AutoCAD 2006. The balloon
notification now contains a Reload Modified Xrefs hyperlink. However, you
can still click the status bar icon and run Xref Manager if you want to choose
which xrefs get reloaded.
325
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

Another advantage of xrefs over blocks is that their contents aren’t stored
in your drawing even once. The disk storage space taken up by the original
drawing (that is, the xref) isn’t duplicated, no matter how many parent draw-
ings reference it. This characteristic makes xrefs much more efficient than
blocks for larger drawings that are reused several times.
You can always buy a larger hard drive, however, so the storage issue isn’t
crucial. The key benefit of xrefs is that they enable you to organize your
drawings in a modular way so that changes you make to a single drawing file
automatically “ripple through” all the parent drawings to which it’s xrefed.
This benefit is even greater on larger projects involving multiple drafters,
each of whose work may be incorporated in part or in whole in the work of
others.
The automatic update feature of xrefs is a big advantage only if you’re orga-
nized about how you use xrefs. Suppose that an architect creates a plan draw-
ing showing a building’s walls and other major features that are common to the
architectural, structural, plumbing, and electrical plan drawings. The architect
then tells the structural, plumbing, and electrical drafters to xref this back-
ground plan into their drawings, so that everyone is working from a consistent
and reusable set of common plan elements. If the architect decides to revise
the wall locations and updates the xrefed drawing, everyone will see the cur-
rent wall configuration and be able to change their drawings. But if the archi-
tect absentmindedly adds architecture-specific objects, such as toilets and
furniture, to the xrefed drawing, or shifts all the objects with respect to 0,0,
everyone else will have problems. If different people in your office share xrefs,
create a protocol for who is allowed to modify which file when, and what com-
munication needs to take place after a shared xref is modified.
Becoming attached to your xrefs
Attaching an external reference is similar to inserting a block, and almost as
easy. Just use the following steps:
1. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 5.
We recommend that you insert xrefs on a separate layer from all other
objects. Note that if you freeze the layer an xref is inserted on, the entire
xref disappears. (This behavior can be either a handy trick or a nasty
surprise.)
2. Choose Insert➪Xref Manager to start the XRef command.
The Xref Manager dialog box appears (see Figure 13-11).
Don’t choose Insert➪External Reference. This menu choice jumps ahead
to Step 4, which will be confusing at this point.
326
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

3. Click the Attach button.
The Select Reference File dialog box appears.
4. Browse to find the file you want to attach, select it, and then click
Open.
The External Reference dialog box appears.
5. Specify the parameters for the xref in the dialog box.
Parameters include the insertion point, scaling factors, and rotation
angle. You can set these parameters in the dialog box or specify them
on-screen, just as you can do when inserting a block, as described ear-
lier in this chapter.
You can select the Attachment or Overlay radio button to tell AutoCAD
how to handle the xref. The choice matters only if you create a drawing
that uses xrefs, and then your drawing is in turn used as an xref.
Attachment is the default choice, and it means that the xrefed file will
always be included with your drawing when someone else uses your
drawing as an xref. Overlay, the other choice, means that you see the
xrefed drawing, but someone who xrefs your drawing won’t see the over-
laid file. By choosing Overlay, you can xref in a map, for example, to your
drawing of a house, but not have the map show up when someone else
xrefs your house drawing. (That person can xref the map, if need be.) We
recommend that you use the default Attachment reference type unless
you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
The Path Type drop-down list provides more flexibility in how the xref’s
path gets stored. See the “Forging an xref path” section later, in this
chapter, for more information. For now, we recommend that you choose
Relative Path instead of the default Full Path.
6. Click OK.
The externally referenced file appears in your drawing.

Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

Layer-palooza
When you attach or overlay an xref, AutoCAD adds new layers to your current
drawing that correspond to the layers in the xrefed DWG file. The new layers
are assigned names that combine the drawing name and layer name; for exam-
ple, if you xref the drawing MYSCREW.DWG, which has the layer names GEOME-
TRY, TEXT, and so on, the xrefed layers will be named MYSCREW|GEOMETRY,
MYSCREW|TEXT, and so on. By creating separate layers corresponding to
each layer in the xrefed file, AutoCAD eliminates the potential problem we
warned you about with blocks when layers have the same name but different
color or linetype in the two drawings.
AutoCAD also creates new linetypes, text styles, dimension styles, and
block definitions for each of these items in the xrefed file — for example,
MYSCREW|DASHED, MYSCREW|NOTES, MYSCREW|A-DIMS, and
MYSCREW|LOGO.
Creating and editing an external
reference file
To create a file that you can use as an external reference, just create a draw-
ing and save it (or use the WBLOCK command to create a new DWG from
geometry in the current drawing). That’s it. You then can create or open
another drawing and create an external reference to the previous one. The
xrefed drawing appears in your parent drawing as a single object, like a block
insert. In other words, if you click any object in the xref, AutoCAD selects the
entire xref. You can measure or object snap to the xrefed geometry, but you
can’t modify or delete individual objects in the xref — you open the xref
drawing in order to edit its geometry.
AutoCAD’s XOPEN command provides a quick way to open an xrefed drawing
for editing. You just start the command and pick on any object in the xref.
Alternatively, you can use the Open button in the Xref Manager dialog box to
open one or more xrefs for editing. See the “Managing xrefs” section, later in
this chapter, for more information.
An alternative to opening the xrefed file when you need to edit it is to use the
REFEDIT command. Look up “REFEDIT” in the AutoCAD online help system.
Forging an xref path
When you attach an xref, AutoCAD by default stores the xref’s full path — that
is, the drive letter and sequence of folders and subfolders in which the DWG
file resides — along with the filename. This default behavior corresponds to
328
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

the Full Path setting in the Path Type drop-down list. (Figure 13-12 shows the
three xref path options.) Full Path works fine as long as you never move files
on your hard disk or network and never send your DWG files to anyone else —
which is to say, it almost never works fine!
At the other end of the path spectrum, the No Path option causes AutoCAD
not to store any path with the xref attachment — only the filename is stored.
This is the easiest and best option if the parent and child drawings reside in
the same folder.
If you prefer to organize the DWG files for a particular project in more than
one folder, then you’ll appreciate AutoCAD’s Relative Path option, shown in
Figure 13-12. This option permits xrefing across more complex, hierarchical
folder structures, but avoids many of the problems that the Full Path option
can cause. For example, you may have a parent drawing H:\Project-X\
Plans\First floor.dwg that xrefs H:\Project-X\Common\Column grid.
dwg. If you choose Relative path, AutoCAD will store the xref path as ..\
Common\Column grid.dwg instead of H:\Project-X\Common\Column
grid.dwg. Now if you decide to move the \Project-X folder and its subfold-
ers to a different drive (or send them to someone else who doesn’t have an H:
drive), AutoCAD will still be able to find the xrefs.
When you use Relative path, you’ll see xref paths that include the special
codes . and .. (single and double period). The single period means “this
parent drawing’s folder” and the double period means “the folder above this
parent drawing’s folder” (in other words, the folder of which the parent draw-
ing’s folder is a subfolder).
You can report on and change xref paths for a set of drawings with the
AutoCAD Reference Manager. See Chapter 16 for more information.
Figure 13-12:
Chart your
path when
you attach
an xref.
329
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

If all these path options and periods have got you feeling punchy, you can
keep your life simple by always keeping parent and child drawings in the
same folder and using the No Path option when you attach xrefs.
Managing xrefs
The Xref Manager dialog box includes many more options for managing xrefs
after you attach them. Important dialog box options include:
 List of external references: You can change between a List and a Tree
view of your drawing’s external references just by clicking the appropri-
ate button at the top of the dialog box. You also can resize the columns
by dragging the column dividers or resort the list by clicking the column
header names, just as in other Windows dialog boxes.
 Detach: Completely removes the selected reference to the external file
from your drawing.
 Reload: Causes AutoCAD to reread the selected xrefed DWG file from the
disk and update your drawing with its latest contents. This feature is
handy when you share xrefs on a network and someone has just made
changes to a drawing that you’ve xrefed.
 Unload: Makes the selected xref disappear from the on-screen display
of your drawing and from any plots you do of it, but retains the pointer
and attachment information. Click the Reload button to redisplay an
unloaded xref.
 Bind: Brings the selected xref into your drawing and makes it a block.
You might use this function, for example, to “roll up” a complex set of
xrefs into a single archive drawing.
In many offices, binding xrefs without an acceptable reason for doing so
is a crime as heinous as exploding blocks indiscriminately. In both cases,
you’re eliminating an important data management link. Find out what
the policies are in your company. When in doubt, keep yourself out of a
bind. And even when you do have a good reason to bind, you generally
should do it on a copy of the parent drawing.
 Open: Opens one or more xref drawings in separate drawing windows
after you close the Xref Manager dialog box. After you edit and save an
xref drawing, return to the parent drawing and use the Reload option in
the Xref Manager dialog box to show the changes.
None of these options (other than opening and editing the xref) affects the
xrefed drawing itself; it continues to exist as a separate DWG file. If you need to
delete or move the DWG file that the xref refers to, do it in Windows Explorer.
330
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

The fact that the xrefed drawing is a separate file is a potential source of
problems when you send your drawing to someone else; that someone else
needs all the files that your drawing depends on, or it will be useless to the
receiving party. Make sure to include xrefed files in the package with your
drawing. See Chapter 16 for a procedure.
AutoCAD (but not AutoCAD LT) includes an additional xref feature called xref
clipping. You can use the XCLIP command to clip an externally referenced file
so only part of it appears in the parent drawing. AutoCAD LT doesn’t include
the XCLIP command, but if you open a drawing containing an xref that was
clipped in AutoCAD, the clipped view will be preserved.
Blocks, Xrefs, and Drawing Organization
Blocks and xrefs are useful for organizing sets of drawings to use and update
repeated elements. It’s not always clear, though, when to use blocks and
when to use xrefs. Applications for xrefs include
 The parts of a title block that are the same on all sheets in a project.
 Reference elements that need to appear in multiple drawings (for exam-
ple, wall outlines, site topography, column grids).
 Assemblies that are repeated in one or more drawings, especially if 
the assemblies are likely to change together (for example, repeated
framing assemblies, bathroom layouts, modular furniture layouts).
 Pasting up several drawings (for example, details or a couple of plans)
onto one plot sheet.
 Temporarily attaching a background drawing for reference or tracing.
On the other hand, blocks remain useful in simpler circumstances. Situations
in which you might stick with a block are
 Components that aren’t likely to change.
 Small components.
 A simple assembly that’s used repeatedly, but in only one drawing. (You
can easily update a block in one drawing with the REDEFIT command.)
 When you want to include attributes (variable text fields) that you can fill
in each time you insert a block. Blocks let you include attribute defini-
tions; xrefs don’t.
Everyone in a company or workgroup should aim for consistency in when and
how they use blocks and xrefs. Check whether guidelines exist for using blocks
and xrefs in your office. If so, follow them; if not, it would be a good idea to
develop some guidelines. Chapter 15 discusses how to start such guidelines.
331
Chapter 13: Playing Blocks and Rasteroids

Mastering the Raster
AutoCAD includes another xreflike feature: the ability to attach raster images
to drawings. This feature is useful for adding a raster logo to a drawing title
block or placing a photographed map or scene behind a drawing. A raster,
or bitmapped, image is one that’s stored as a field of tiny points.
Most AutoCAD drawings are vector images. A vector image is an image defined
by storing geometrical definitions of a bunch of objects. Typical objects
include a line, defined by its two endpoints, and a circle, defined by its center
point and radius. Vector-based images are typically smaller (in terms of the
disk space they occupy) and more flexible than raster images, but also are
less capable of displaying visually rich images such as photographs.
Raster images often come from digital cameras or from other programs, such
as Photoshop. Raster images also can come into the computer from some
kind of scanner that imports a blueline print, photograph, or other image.
Whether you’re doing your scanning yourself or having a service bureau do it
for you, you need to know that AutoCAD handles most of the popular image
file formats including the Windows BMP format, the popular Web graphics
formats GIF and JPEG, the popular PCX and TIFF formats, as well as DIB, FLC,
FLI, GP4, MIL, PNG, RLE, RST, and TGA.
Here are three scenarios to incorporate raster images in your drawing:
 Small stuff: You can add logos, special symbols, and other small images
that you have in raster files.
 Photographs and maps: You can add photographs (such as a future
building site) and maps (for example, showing the project location).
 Vectorization: To convert a raster image into a vector drawing by tracing
lines in the raster image, you can attach the raster image in your drawing,
trace the needed lines by using AutoCAD commands, and then detach the
raster image. (This procedure is okay for a simple raster image; add-on
software is available, from Autodesk and others, to support automatic or
semiautomatic vectorization of more complex images.)
Using raster images is much like using external references. The raster image
isn’t stored with your drawing file; a reference to the raster image file is
established from within your drawing, like an xref. You can clip the image and
control its size, brightness, contrast, fade, and transparency. These controls
fine-tune the appearance of the raster image on-screen and on a plot.
When you attach raster images, you have to make sure that you send the
raster files along when you send your drawing to someone else.
332
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

AutoCAD LT can open, view, and plot drawings containing attached raster
images, but LT can’t do the attaching. Raster masters require full AutoCAD.
Attaching an image
Follow these steps to bring a raster image into AutoCAD:
1. Choose Insert➪Image Manager or type IMage at the command line to
start the IMage command.
The Image Manager dialog box appears (see Figure 13-13).
2. Click the Attach button.
The Select Image File dialog box appears.
3. Browse to find the file you want to attach, select it, and then click Open.
The Image dialog box appears.
Click the Details button in the Image dialog box to see more information
about the resolution and image size of the image you’re attaching.
4. Specify the parameters for the attached image in the dialog box.
Parameters include the insertion point, scale factor, and rotation angle.
You can set these parameters in the dialog box or specify them on-screen,
similar to what you can do with blocks and external references, as
described earlier in this chapter. Use the quick dialog box help (click the
question mark in the dialog box’s title bar and then click the area in the
dialog box for which you want help) or click the dialog box’s Help button
to find out more about specific options.
The IMage command includes the same Full Path, Relative Path, and No
Path options as those for attaching xrefs. (See the “Forging an xref path”
section, earlier in this chapter.)

5. Click OK.
The image appears in your drawing.
6. If you need to ensure that the raster image floats behind other objects
in the drawing, select the raster image, right-click, choose Draw Order,
and then choose Send to Back.
The DRaworder command provides additional options for which objects
appear on top of which other objects. If you need this kind of flexibility,
look up “DRAWORDER command” in the AutoCAD online help system.
Managing your image
You manage the images in your drawing with the Image Manager dialog box.
It includes virtually the same options as the External References dialog box.
You can view a list of image files that appear in the current drawing, detach
(remove) image references, and unload and reload images when needed. You
can’t bind an image to your drawing; it always remains an external file.
You can clip images so that only part of the image is displayed in your draw-
ing. Choose Modify➪Clip➪Image and follow the prompts to clip the image.
You can have multiple overlapping or distinct pieces of any number of images
in your drawing, and only the parts you need are loaded into memory when
you have your drawing open.
Raster image files often are larger than DWG files of corresponding complex-
ity; raster file size can affect performance within AutoCAD because the raster
file loads into memory when you are working on your drawing. Some work-
arounds speed up operations:
 Attach raster images late in the production process. 
 Create a lower-resolution version of the raster file, just large enough to
create the desired effect in your drawing.
 Click the Unload button in the Image Manager dialog box to temporarily
disable an image without losing the attachment information.
In addition, raster files can increase the time that AutoCAD takes to generate
plots (and the plot file sizes) dramatically. Before you settle on using large
raster files in your AutoCAD drawing, do some testing on zooming, editing,
and plotting.

Sheet Sets without Regrets
In This Chapter
 Understanding resource drawings, views, and sheets
 Creating and using sheet sets
 Adding drawings and assembling views
 Adding a sheet list table
A
typical AutoCAD project can include dozens of drawings, scores of
sheets, lots of layouts, copious cross-drawing references, and more
than a few people working on those components at once. How do you create,
manage, update, plot, and generally keep a handle on all that stuff without
going crazy? The sheet sets feature is AutoCAD’s response to this challenge.
Without sheet sets, you must manage project drawings “manually” — that is,
you have to make sure that all the project’s drawings get created, get num-
bered and named correctly, and have up-to-date title block information. You
also have to ensure that cross-sheet references are accurate (for example,
when a plan includes references to details on other sheets). When the time
comes to send drawings to clients or consultants, you must ensure that you
include all the sheets and that all of them are up to date. For a large project
with many drawings, these can be daunting tasks. It’s easy to end up with
missing sheets or sheets that contain obsolete title block or cross-reference
information, especially when you add or renumber sheets later in a project. 
Sheet sets comprise a new palette, a group of completely new commands,
and a few updated existing features. Together, these things make possible a
new approach to managing all the drawings for a project. Sheet sets provide
a single interface that lists all your sheets, their numbers, and their names.
(AutoCAD stores this information, along with the relationships among the
sheets, in a DST file.) You can add and renumber sheets easily. You can create
cross-sheet references that update automatically after you renumber sheets,
and you can create a sheet list on your title sheet that updates automatically
after you change sheet numbers or titles. When you’re ready to send or plot
drawings, a sheet set enables AutoCAD to locate and gather all the required
files.

The sheet sets approach was new in AutoCAD 2005, and it remains to be seen
how quickly (or whether) AutoCAD users adopt it. We predict that companies
with well-managed CAD production staffs that work on larger projects requiring
lots of sheets will find sheet sets compelling and move to adopt them quickly.
Companies whose projects require only a few drawing sheets or whose
AutoCAD users tend to do their own thing with little central organization prob-
ably will continue to deal with sheets as discreet, unconnected DWG files.
Sheet sets rely on other relatively sophisticated AutoCAD features, so make
sure that you’re familiar with the following before you delve into this chapter:
 Paper space layouts (Chapter 4)
 Named views (Chapter 8)
 Tables and text fields (Chapter 9)
 Blocks and attributes (Chapter 13)
 External references (Chapter 13)
Understanding external references and layouts is especially important because
these features are central to the way that the Sheet Set Manager creates and
organizes sheets.
Taming Sheet Sets
Your passport to the brave new world of sheet sets comes in the form of the
Sheet Set Manager palette, shown in Figure 14-1. You use this palette for most
sheet set operations. To toggle the palette on or off, click the Sheet Set
Manager button (which looks like a roll of drawings) on the Standard toolbar
or press Ctrl+4. If you choose to leave the palette on most of the time, you
may want to turn on its auto-hide setting so that it gets out of the way auto-
matically when you’re not using it — refer to Chapter 2 for instructions.
The Sheet Set Manager palette’s three tabs indicate the three major types of
objects you use to create and manage sheet sets:
 Resource Drawings contain subcomponents such as individual plans,
details, and elevations that you use to build your sheets. Resource draw-
ings usually contain geometry and annotations in model space only.
Resource drawings usually don’t include title blocks or paper space lay-
outs. You must add DWG files to the Resource Drawings tab before you
can create Views and add them to Sheets.
 Views are areas of resource drawings that you place on a sheet. A sheet
set view can be the entire resource drawing or just a portion of it that
336
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

you’ve defined, using the AutoCAD named views feature. (Chapter 8
explains named views and shows how to create them.) 
You don’t have to use named views in order to take advantage of sheet
sets, but you may use them to assemble different areas of a resource
drawing onto one or more sheets. For example, if you draw a large plan
that needs to be broken up onto several sheets in order to plot at a legi-
ble scale, you define a named view for each area of the plan and place
each view on a separate sheet.
 Sheets are paper space layouts within drawing files. (Chapter 4 describes
layouts and shows how to create them.) Each entry on the Sheet List tab
corresponds to one physical sheet in the sheet set. With the sheet set
methodology, AutoCAD attaches resource drawings as external refer-
ences (or xrefs — see Chapter 13 for more information) into sheet draw-
ings and creates paper space viewports on a layout in order to show the
desired area of the resource drawing — either a named view or the entire
drawing. You use the Sheet Set Manager to tell AutoCAD which resource
drawings and views to put on which sheets. AutoCAD then does the
attach-xref-and-make-viewport procedure automatically.
AutoCAD stores the settings for all this stuff — the names of files and configu-
ration data that control how the sheet set features work with those files — in
a DST file. Each project has its own DST file, and multiple AutoCAD users can
use one project’s DST file at the same time.

337
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

Using an Existing Sheet Set
The quickest way to get started with sheet sets is to use one that someone
else — such as a CAD manager in your office — has set up. You also can
experiment with Autodesk’s sheet set samples, located in C:\Program
Files\AutoCAD 2006\Sample\Sheet Sets.
To open an existing sheet set configuration, do one of the following:
 Click the menu at the top of the Sheet Set Manager palette and choose
Open. AutoCAD displays a file dialog box, in which you can navigate to
the appropriate folder, select the sheet set data file, and click the Open
button.
 In Windows Explorer, double-click on a DST file.
In either case, AutoCAD displays the sheet set information in the Sheet Set
Manager palette, as shown in Figure 14-1. Click each of the three tabs to get
an idea of how the particular sheet set that you opened is configured.
With a sheet set open, you’re ready to perform tasks such as these:
 Double-click a name on any of the tabs to open the corresponding DWG
file in AutoCAD. Double-clicking a sheet name on the Sheet List tab or a
drawing name on the Resource Drawings tab opens that DWG file, while
double-clicking a view name on the View List tab opens the DWG file and
zooms to the view. Thus, you can use the Sheet Set Manager to navigate
quickly among all the drawings for a project.
 Right-click the sheet set name or a sheet subset name on the Sheet List
tab to create a new sheet, using the template drawing (DWT file) config-
ured for the project or sheet subset. (The “Getting Your Sheets Together”
section, later in this chapter, describes how to specify the DWT file for a
sheet set or subset.)
 Right-click a resource drawing to place it — either the entire drawing or
a named view within it — on a sheet drawing.
 Right-click a sheet or view to rename and renumber it. Names and num-
bers can be linked to labels on the sheets, so that when you change the
names or numbers in the Sheet Set Manager, AutoCAD automatically
updates them in all drawings where they appear. (See the next two para-
graphs for more information.)
 Right-click the sheet set name to add a sheet list table (that is, an index
of the drawings for the project) to the current drawing. AutoCAD uses
the name and number data described in the preceding paragraph to

 On the View List tab, right-click the sheet set name and choose Properties
to specify label blocks and callout blocks. Then you can right-click view
names to place these automatically updating blocks in drawings. Label
blocks show the number and name of a part of a drawing (for example, a
single detail or a plan). Callout blocks reference another part of the draw-
ing set — usually on another sheet (for example, a pointer on a plan to an
elevation or detail on a different sheet). 
 Right-click sheets or subsets to publish them, package them for elec-
tronic transmittal, or archive them for yourself. (Chapter 16 includes
instructions for these tasks.)
The rest of this chapter provides details and procedures for many of these
operations.
You don’t have to use all the features described earlier in order to benefit
from sheet sets. For example, you might use the Sheet Set Manager just to
create a navigational list of your drawings, add a sheet index to the cover
sheet of the drawing set, and batch plot all the sheets.
The Sheet Set Setup
If you don’t have an obliging CAD manager to configure sheets sets for you,
then you’ll have to do it yourself. You use the Create Sheet Set Wizard for this
task. Follow these steps to create a new sheet set:
1. Open the menu at the top of the Sheet Set Manager palette and choose
New Sheet Set. 
The Create Sheet Set Wizard appears.
2. Choose Create a Sheet Set Using Existing Drawings, and then click Next.
The Sheet Set Details page appears, as shown in Figure 14-2.
3. Type a name and description for the sheet set, and then choose a
directory for the DST (sheet set configuration data) file.
By default, AutoCAD stores DST files that you create in your local My
Documents\AutoCAD Sheet Sets folder. Unless you’re the only person
working on a project, you should instead put DST files in a commonly
accessible place on your local network. You can store the DST files for
all projects in a single network folder or simply keep each project’s DST
file in the same folder that holds the project’s DWG files.

Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

4. Click the Sheet Set Properties button, review the other settings, and
click OK.
You can change all this stuff later in the Sheet Set Manager palette, so
don’t worry too much about it now. Use the dialog box help (click the
question mark and then click on a setting) to find out more about any
of the settings.
5. Click Next.
The Choose Layouts page appears. You can click the Browse button to
add any drawing(s) that you’ve already created for the project to the
sheet set, but it’s just as easy to add them later in the Sheet Set Manager
palette. (We show you how in the next section.)
6. Click Next.
The wizard displays a summary of the settings that it saved to the new
DST file.
7. Click Finish.
AutoCAD closes the Create Sheet Set Wizard and opens your new sheet
set in the Sheet Set Manager palette.
The other way to create a new sheet set is to copy one from an existing DST
file. If you choose Create a Sheet Set Using an Example Sheet Set in Step 2,
then you can choose from half a dozen Autodesk samples or open a file
dialog box and browse to other DST files. The Autodesk examples are fine
for experimenting, but you will need to modify them in order to make them
usable on real projects.
To change any of the sheet set properties (which you reviewed in Step 5 in
the preceding list), right-click the sheet set name on the Sheet List tab of the
Sheet Set Manager palette and choose Properties.

Getting Your Sheets Together
A new sheet set without any sheets is a lonely thing indeed, so after you create
a new sheet set, you’ll need to populate the set with drawings. A common way
to get started is to create a drawing with a suitable layout and title block in
paper space and then add it to the set. The other method is to direct the Sheet
Set Manager to create a new drawing, using the template and folder that’s con-
figured in the sheet set properties. We cover both methods here.
Adding existing sheets to a set
Use these steps to add an existing drawing to the sheet set for a project:
1. Create and save at least one properly set up drawing, including a
paper space layout. (See Chapter 4 for details.)
If you delete any unused layout tabs (by right-clicking the tab and choos-
ing Delete), the sheet list will turn out cleaner and less confusing. When
you’re using sheet sets, it’s usually best to set up and use just one layout
per drawing file.
2. Open the Sheet Set Manager palette.
3. (Optional) On the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set Manager palette,
right-click the sheet set name and choose New Subset. Type a subset
name and click OK.
You can use sheets subsets to group your sheets into categories. See the
“Sheet subsets” section after these steps for an explanation and examples.
This isn’t your only chance to assign a sheet to a subset. You can create
the subset later and then drag the sheet into it.
4. Right-click the sheet set name (or the subset name that you created in
the previous step) and choose Import Layout as Sheet.
The Import Layouts as Sheets dialog box appears.
5. Click the browse button (the one with an ellipsis on it).
6. Navigate to and select the drawing that you created in Step 1, and
then click Open.
AutoCAD will report an error if you try to import a drawing that doesn’t
contain any configured layouts.
7. Select one or more layouts to import into the Sheet List and click OK.
AutoCAD adds the layout(s) to the Sheet List, as shown in Figure 14-3.
The sheet name is a combination of the DWG file name (S-sheet-plans-01
in this figure) and layout name (30x42).
341
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

8. Right-click the newly imported sheet and choose Rename and
Renumber.
The Rename and Renumber Sheet dialog box appears.
9. Type a Sheet Number and Sheet Title in the text boxes, and then
click OK.
If you later create a sheet list table — that is, a drawing sheet index —
for your cover sheet, then AutoCAD will use what you type here to
describe the sheet. (We demonstrate this procedure at the end of this
chapter.) You usually should type the sheet number and title as they
will appear in the title block. This information also helps you and others
identify the sheet unambiguously in the Sheet List.
Sheet subsets
On the Sheet List tab, you can create sheet subsets to organize your sheets
into types — for example, plan sheets, elevation sheets, and detail sheets.
The advantages of using subsets are
 On a project with lots of drawings, you can find drawings and under-
stand what kinds of drawings make up the set more easily. This kind of
organization also makes it easy to select a group of related files for plot-
ting or transmitting to someone else.
Figure 14-3:
An

342
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

 You can configure each subset to use a unique template drawing (for
example, DWT file). Thus, when you create new drawings with the Sheet
Set Manager, as described in the next section, different kinds of drawings
can start from different templates. For example, you might use one tem-
plate to start plans and a different one to start details, based on different
scales or other considerations.
 You can configure each subset to create new sheet drawings in different
folders. For example, you might keep your plan sheets and detail sheets
in two different folders.
To configure both of the second two options, right-click the subset name and
choose Properties.
Don’t confuse sheet subsets with sheet selections. You create the latter with
the Sheet Selections button at the top of the Sheet List tab. A sheet selection
is simply a grouping of sheets with a name attached to it. You can use sheet
selections to grab a group of sheets quickly for transmitting, archiving, or
publishing. (Chapter 16 describes these activities.) Sheet selections don’t
store any configuration information and don’t affect the organization of the
Sheet List. Sheet subsets do both of those things.
Creating new sheets for a set
Use the following steps to create a new sheet drawing, using the configura-
tion settings for the sheet set:
1. (Optional) On the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set Manager palette,
right-click the sheet set name and choose New Subset. Type a subset
name and click OK.
2. Right-click the sheet set name or subset name and choose Properties.
The Sheet Set Properties dialog box appears.
3. Verify or change the Sheet Creation properties, and then click OK.
Sheet Storage Location determines where the new sheet DWG file will
get created, and Sheet Creation Template specifies the DWT file that it
gets created from.
4. Right-click the sheet set name or subset name and choose New Sheet.
The New Sheet dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-4.
5. Type a Sheet Number, Sheet Title, and File Name in the text boxes,
and then click OK.
The procedure in the “Adding existing sheets to a set” section (a bit ear-
lier in this chapter) describes what the Sheet Number and Sheet Title
are for. File Name determines the name of the DWG file that AutoCAD
creates. AutoCAD generates the default file name by combining the
343
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

sheet number and sheet title. You probably want to remove the sheet
number from this automatically generated name, for the reasons
described in the following Tip.
Don’t type .DWG in the File Name box. AutoCAD always adds the file exten-
sion, so if you type .DWG, AutoCAD will create a file named Whatever.
Dwg.Dwg. 
If you anticipate ever having to renumber sheets on your project — and even
if you don’t anticipate it, it may happen! — you should name your sheet files
based on their general contents rather than their (current) sheet numbers.
For example, when you create an architectural floor plan that you anticipate
will be sheet A-201, name the sheet file A-FP01.dwg (first floor plan in the
series) instead of A-201.dwg. By giving sheet files names that are indepen-
dent of their sheet numbers, you retain the flexibility to renumber sheets
automatically later with just a few changes in the Sheet Set Manager.
Assembling sheet views from
resource drawings
After you create a new sheet (or add an existing one that doesn’t yet contain
all the necessary drawing components), you use the Resource Drawing tab to
compose views on the sheet. A view can be simply the entire drawing, or it
can be a named view that you’ve created in the resource drawing. In all cases,
the Sheet Set Manager attaches the resource drawing as an xref to the sheet
drawing and creates a properly scaled viewport on the sheet drawing’s
layout. Each sheet can contain one view (for example, a large plan) or more
than one (for example, several elevations or a dozen details).
To place an entire resource drawing on a sheet, follow these steps:
1. On the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set Manager palette, double-click
the sheet to which you want to add the resource drawing.
AutoCAD opens the drawing for editing.
Figure 14-4:

2. Click the Resource Drawings tab.
3. If you haven’t yet specified the folder that contains the resource draw-
ing that you want to use, double-click Add New Location, browse to
the directory, and click the Open button.
You can add more than one folder to the Resource Drawings tab.
4. Right-click the resource drawing that you want to add to the sheet,
choose Place on Sheet, and move the cursor into the sheet drawing’s
layout.
AutoCAD attaches the resource drawing as an xref and creates a view-
port for it. You position the viewport with the cursor. 
5. Right-click.
A scale menu appears, as shown in Figure 14-5.
6. Choose the proper scale for the resource drawing.
AutoCAD rescales the viewport, and you continue to drag it with the
cursor.
Figure 14-5:
Adding a
view to a

345
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

7. Position the viewport where you want it and click.
AutoCAD places the viewport on the sheet.
If you need to adjust the viewport later, select it and use grip editing, the
Properties palette, or the Viewports toolbar to make changes.
8. Click the View List tab on the Sheet Set Manager palette.
AutoCAD has added the resource drawing that you just used to the list
of views for this sheet set.
9. Right-click the new view name and choose Rename and Renumber.
The Rename and Renumber View dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 14-6.
10. Type a View Number and View Title in the text boxes, and then
click OK.
As we describe earlier in this chapter, you can direct the Sheet Set
Manager to use this information to create automatically updating labels.
For example, if you place a detail on a sheet, AutoCAD feeds the informa-
tion in this dialog box to a label block in the sheet drawing that shows
the detail number and title. In addition, you can create callouts on other
sheets that refer to this detail. If you later change the information in this
Figure 14-6:
Specifyin
g a
view’s
number
and title.
346
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

dialog box, the Sheet Set Manager changes it in the detail label as well as
in the callouts that reference the detail. (You create label and callout
blocks in separate drawings, as described in Chapter 13. You then right-
click the sheet set name or a view name and choose Properties to config-
ure the sheet set or view to use these blocks.) Look up “callout blocks
(for sheet views)” and “label blocks (for sheet views)” in the AutoCAD
online help system for detailed instructions. 
AutoCAD 2006’s Attribute Extraction Wizard can search across sheet
sets for data whether the drawings containing the data are open or not.
For example, you could search the entire sheet set for all the window
symbols and extract a schedule.
After you specify callout and label blocks on the View List tab, use the
view’s right-click menu to place either kind of block.
On the View List tab, you can create view categories by right-clicking the
sheet set name and choosing New View Category. Each view category
can use different callout blocks — right-click the view category and
choose Properties to configure callout blocks.
Placing a named view on a layout is just like placing an entire resource draw-
ing, except that on the Resource Drawing tab, you click the plus sign next to
the drawing name to reveal its named views, right-click the desired view, and
choose Place on Sheet. (If you haven’t yet created the named view that you
need, open the drawing by double-clicking it on the Resource Drawing tab,
and choose View➪Named Views to open the View dialog box. See the section
titled “A View by Any Other Name . . .” in Chapter 8 for instructions on how to
create named views.)
Making an Automatic Sheet List
After you create sheets and assemble views on them from resource drawings,
you can take advantage of the additional sheet set features described in the
“Using an Existing Sheet Set” section, earlier in this chapter. For example, you
can batch plot all the sheets for a project by right-clicking the sheet set name
and choosing Publish➪Publish to Plotter. (Chapter 16 describes the PUBLISH
command.)
Before you publish your CAD magnum opus, however, you probably want to
create an index. As long as you’re diligent about filling in the sheet number
and title properties, as we advise in the “Adding existing sheets to a set” and
“Creating new sheets for a set” sections earlier in this chapter, the Sheet Set
Manager will build a drawing index for you automatically. Even better, when
you add, remove, renumber, or rename sheets, AutoCAD updates the index
automatically. The Sheet Set Manager creates the drawing index, using
AutoCAD’s table object, for which reason it’s called a sheet list table. (See
Chapter 9 for information about tables.)
347
Chapter 14: Sheet Sets without Regrets

Use the following steps to create an automatic and automatically updateable
sheet list table:
1. On the Sheet List tab of the Sheet Set Manager palette, double-click
the sheet to which you want to add the drawing index.
AutoCAD opens the drawing for editing.
2. Right-click the sheet set name and choose Insert Sheet List Table.
The Insert Sheet List Table dialog box appears.
3. If you’re not happy with the fonts, text heights, colors, or text align-
ment of the table in the Table Style Settings area, click the ellipsis
button to open the Table Style dialog box, create and configure a new
style, and then click Close to return to the Insert Sheet List Table
dialog box.
Chapter 9 shows how to create table styles.
The default alignment for the data cells is Top Center. You may want to
change it to Top Left (that is, align sheet numbers and titles left flush
rather than centered).
4. If you want to change the number of columns, which data appear in
each column, and what the column headings and table title say, use
the Table Data Settings area to do so.
Click the Add button to create an additional column. Drop-down lists in
the Column Settings area show the types of data that you can include in
the table. (Double-click the entry in the Data Type column to display the
drop-down list.) Much of the additional, optional data come from the
Drawing Properties dialog box, which we describe in Chapter 4. (The
Sheet Number, Title, Description, and Plot data all come from the sheet
set properties.)
5. Click OK.
By default, AutoCAD displays a dialog box reminding you not to edit
the sheet list table manually, because the Sheet Set Manager handles it
automatically.
6. Click OK.
AutoCAD creates the table, and you drag it with the cursor.
7. Position the table where you want it and click.
AutoCAD places the table on the sheet. Each of the data cells is a field
that gets its value from the sheet set properties (see Figure 14-7) or
drawing properties.

After you make changes to the Sheet List, such as adding a sheet or editing a
sheet title, select the table, right-click, and choose Update Sheet List Table.
Now are computers great, or what?! 
If you didn’t quite get the sheet list table properties right on the first try,
select the table, right-click, and choose Edit Sheet List Table Settings.
Sheet sets are poised to profoundly alter the way that people create and
manage drawings in AutoCAD. Like all software innovations that increase the
sophistication of a process and manage dependencies, sheet sets require
some study, some configuration, and significant coordination on everyone’s
part. (One good resource is the group of sheet sets tutorials in Help➪New
Features Workshop.) In this case, those who expend the effort are likely to be
well rewarded.

I
f you’ve ever worked with other people to create a multichapter, visually
complex, frequently updated text document, then you probably under-
stand the importance of coordinating how everyone works on the parts of
the document. Even if you’re someone who churns out documents from your
one-person office or lonely cubicle, you probably try to ensure a reasonably
consistent look and feel in similar documents. You employ consistent fonts,
the same company logo, and the same paper size in most documents — or if
you don’t, you probably at least think that you should!
CAD exacts similar demands for reasonable consistency, only more so:
 Most companies would like to take pride in the clarity and consistency
of their drawings. Sloppy drawings with randomly varying text heights
and lineweights don’t reflect well on you, and they make your drawings
harder to read. 
 CAD drawings that don’t conform with some logically consistent scheme
usually are harder to edit and to reuse by others who work on the pro-
ject and by you when you work on other projects.
This stuff is important enough in CAD that it has a special name: CAD stan-
dards. Those people compulsive enough to fret about it all the time and sadis-
tic enough to impose their fretting on others also have a special name: CAD
managers. This chapter won’t turn you into a CAD manager — a reassurance
you’re probably grateful for — but it does introduce the most important CAD
standards issues. This chapter also suggests some ways to come up with
your own simple CAD standards, in case you’re going it alone and don’t have
the benefit of a ready-made company or project CAD standards document to
guide you. The chapter ends with an overview of AutoCAD tools that can
help you comply with and check conformity to CAD standards.

Why CAD Standards?
Throughout this book, we emphasize things like setting up your drawings
properly, drawing objects on appropriate and consistently named layers, and
specifying suitable text fonts and heights. These practices amount to con-
forming to a CAD standard.
You need to do these things if you work with or exchange drawings with
others. If you don’t, several bad things will happen. You’ll be pegged as a
clueless newbie by experienced drafters, who understand the importance
of CAD consistency. Even if your ego can handle the contempt, you’ll make
everyone’s work slower and more difficult. And if the project has electronic
drawing submittal requirements, you may find that your client rejects your
DWG files and demands that you make them conform to the CAD standards
in the contract.
Even if you work solo and don’t have any particular requirements imposed
from outside, your own work will go more smoothly and look better if you
adhere to a reasonably consistent way of doing things in AutoCAD. You’ll cer-
tainly find plotting easier and more predictable.
CAD standards originally grew out of a desire to achieve a graphical consis-
tency on the plotted drawings that mirrored the graphical consistency on
hand-drafted drawings. Before the days of CAD, most companies had manual
drafting standards that specified standard lettering (text) sizes, dimension
appearance, symbol shapes, and so on. Sometimes these standards were
based on standard industry reference books, such as Architectural Graphic
Standards.
As CAD users became more sophisticated, they realized that CAD standards
needed to incorporate more than just the look of the resulting plot. CAD
drawings contain a lot more organizational depth than printed drawings —
layers, screen colors, blocks, xrefs, text and dimension styles, and the like. If
these things aren’t subject to a modicum of standardization, different people
who work on the same drawings or projects are likely to end up stumbling
over — or throwing things at — one another.
In short, the first job of CAD standards is to impose some graphical consis-
tency on plotted output. CAD standards also encourage consistency in the
way that people create, assign properties to, organize, and display objects in
the CAD file.
352
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

Which CAD Standards?
If CAD standards are as important as we claim, you might expect that indus-
tries would’ve settled on a standardized way of doing things. No such luck.
Although the manual drafting conventions in many professions have carried
over to some degree into CAD, a lot of the things that need standardization
have been left to the imagination of individual companies, departments, or
people. For example, you’ll find that different companies usually name layers
differently and employ different schemes for mapping object screen color to
plotted lineweight (see Chapter 12). In particularly disorganized companies,
you’ll find that different drafters use different layers and color-to-lineweight.
And in the worst cases, the same drafter will do these things differently in dif-
ferent drawings!
As you can imagine, this proliferation of nonstandard standards makes shar-
ing and reusing parts of CAD drawings a lot more difficult. You can at least
minimize the pain within your own office by conforming to any existing CAD
standards or, if there aren’t any, by encouraging the development of some.
(Later in this chapter, we give some suggestions for how to get started.)
353
Chapter 15: CAD Standards Rule
The aesthetics of CAD
Manual drafting veterans frequently complain
that CAD drawings don’t look as good as the
drawings that they used to create by hand. “Too
‘flat,’ too cartoonish, and inconsistent” are
some of the refrains that you hear. These com-
plaints are not just the whining of old-timers.
Good manual drafters were justifiably proud of
the appearance of their drawings. They focused
on making the finished bluelines look sharp and
read well.
When computers and CAD software got into the
act, it became easy for CAD drafters to focus on
the screen image and pay less attention to the
plotted output. In the early days, CAD users
struggled with a new way of making drawings
and didn’t have as much time to make them look
good. By the time that CAD became common-
place, a new crop of CAD users had grown up
without the benefit of discovering how to make
good-looking drawings on paper.
There’s no reason that CAD drawings can’t look
as good as manual drawings. It’s a matter of
understanding the look that you’re after and
caring enough to want to achieve it. If you see
some especially clear and elegant printed
drawings, find out who drew them and take that
person out to lunch. You’ll probably uncover
some techniques that you can translate into
making better CAD drawings. You may also gain
new respect for the skills of those who made
handsome and functional drawings with the
simplest of tools.

Even if you’re lucky or perseverant enough to get a well-rounded set of CAD
standards in your office, that may not be the end of it. CAD-savvy people from
different companies who collaborate on projects often want to minimize the
pain of inconsistency during drawing exchange. Although each company may
have its own house CAD standards in order, there’s no way that all those
standards will be the same. Thus, one or more companies (often the lead con-
sultant) may impose a set of project-specific CAD standards. Project-specific
standards don’t necessarily need to be as detailed as a full-blown company
CAD standards document, but depending on the project and the person who
created the project-specific CAD standards, they might be.
The result of this confusing muddle of industry practices, company CAD stan-
dards, and project-specific CAD standards is that you find yourself switching
among different standards as you work on different projects. Before you start
making drawings, find out whether any particular CAD standards apply. It’s a
lot easier to start off conforming with those standards than to fix noncon-
forming drawings later.

Industry standards
Professional, trade, and governmental groups in
some industries have made an attempt to pro-
mulgate CAD standards for the benefit of every-
one in the industry. For example, the American
Institute of Architects (AIA), together with sev-
eral professional engineering associations,
published a CAD Layer Guidelines document,
which has become part of a so-called National
CAD Standard that’s now promulgated by the
U.S. government’s National Institute of Building
Sciences, or NIBS (see www.nationalcad
standard.org). The International Organiza-
tion for Standardization, or ISO (the acronym
reflects the French ordering of the words), pub-
lishes ISO standards document 13567 (see
www.iso.ch). This document, which comes in
no fewer than three parts, attempts to provide a
framework for CAD layer standards in the build-
ing design industries throughout the world.
These documents may be useful to you in your
search for standards, but they aren’t a panacea.
The majority of CAD-using companies have
ignored officially promulgated CAD standards,
because these companies developed their own
standards and practices years ago and are
loath to change. That doesn’t mean that you
can’t use the officially promulgated standards,
but they won’t suddenly make you a part of
some mythical CAD standards mainstream.
Also, practical implementation of most official
CAD standards in a specific company requires a
generous amount of clarification, modification,
and additional documentation. In other words,
you don’t just buy the document and then get to
work; someone needs to tailor it to your com-
pany and projects. And finally, some of these
officially promulgated CAD standards docu-
ments are shockingly expensive. Apparently,
these organizations haven’t found out that the
way to make something popular is to post it on
the Web for free!

What Needs to Be Standardized?
If you are in a company or on a project without any CAD standards, put
together at least a minimal set of guidelines. First, impose some consistency
on plotted appearance and use of layers. If you make a few rules for yourself
before you start the project, you’ll end up with drawings that are more pro-
fessional looking and easier to edit — and are more likely to be useful on
future projects.
A spreadsheet or word processing program is great for documenting your CAD
standards decisions as they firm up. Many CAD standards components work
best as tabular lists of layers, colors, and so on. (See Tables 15-1 and 15-2 in
this chapter for examples.) Use the cells in a spreadsheet or the tables feature
in a word processor to organize your CAD standards documentation.
Before you start, make sure that you’re familiar with managing properties
(Chapter 5) and plot styles (Chapter 12). You need a good understanding to
make intelligent decisions about your plotting and layer standards. (If you
want to make unintelligent decisions, don’t worry about those chapters!)
Plotting
If you plan to use color-dependent plot styles (most people do), develop a
color-to-lineweight plotting chart like Table 15-1. If you choose the more logi-
cal but lonelier named plot styles approach, make a similar chart, with plot
style names instead of color in the first column. (See Chapter 12 for informa-
tion about color-dependent and named plot styles.) After you complete a
plotting chart, create a plot style table (CBT file for color-dependent plot
styles or STB file for named plot styles), as described in Chapter 12.

Your life will be easier — and your plotting chart will be shorter — if you
limit yourself to a small portion of the 255 colors in the AutoCAD Color Index
(ACI). The first nine colors work well for many people.
If your work requires screened (shaded or faded-out) lines, extend the plot-
ting chart to include a couple of additional AutoCAD colors. For each color,
list the plotted lineweight and screen percentage ranging from 0 percent for
invisible to 100 percent for solid black.
Layers
After you work out your plotting conventions, you’re ready to develop a chart
of layers. A chart of layers takes more thought and work, and you’ll probably
revise it more frequently than the plotting chart. Find a typical drawing from
your office or industry and identify the things you’ll draw — such as walls,
text, dimensions, and hatching. Then decide how you’d like to parse those
objects onto different layers (see Chapter 5). Here are some guidelines:
 Objects that you want to plot with different lineweights go on differ-
ent layers. Assign each layer an appropriate color, based on how you
want the objects to appear on the screen and on plots. If you’re using
object lineweights (Chapter 5) or named plot styles (Chapter 12),
include a column for these settings in your chart. In all cases, let the
objects inherit these properties from the layer.
 Objects whose visibility you want to control separately go on different
layers. Turn off or freeze a layer in order to make the objects on that
layer, and only the objects on that layer, disappear temporarily.
 Objects that represent significantly different kinds of things in the
real world go on different layers. For example, doors should go on 
different layers from walls in an architectural floor plan.
As you make your layer decisions, you’ll develop a layer chart that resembles
Table 15-2. If you use named plot styles instead of color-dependent plot styles,
add a Plot Style column to the chart.

Non-plotting information
The layer chart in Table 15-2 is simpler than the layer systems used by experi-
enced drafters in most companies. The layer names in the table are based on
names in the AIA CAD Layer Guidelines document mentioned in the “Industry
standards” sidebar. That document recommends adding a discipline-specific
prefix to each layer name: A-Walls for walls drawn by the architectural team, 
S-Walls for walls drawn by the structural team, and so on. 
Other stuff
The following settings and procedures deserve some consistency, too:
 Text styles: Decide on text fonts and heights and use them consistently.
(See Chapter 9 for more information.)
Manual CAD drafting standards often specify a minimum text height of
1⁄8 inch or 3 mm, because hand-lettered text smaller than that becomes
difficult to read, especially on half-size prints. Plotted 3⁄32 inch or 2.5 mm
CAD text is quite legible, but half-size plots with these smaller text
heights can result in text that’s on the margin of legibility. Text legibility
on half-size — or smaller — plots depends on the plotter resolution, the
lineweight assigned to the text, and the condition of your eyes. Test
before you commit to using smaller text heights, or use 1⁄8 inch or 3 mm
as a minimum.
357
Chapter 15: CAD Standards Rule

 Dimension styles: Create a dimension style that reflects your preferred
look and feel. (See Chapter 10.)
 Hatch patterns: Choose the hatch patterns that you need and decide on
an appropriate scale and angle for each. (See Chapter 11.)
 Drawing setup and organization: Set up all the drawings on a project
in the same way, and use sheet sets (Chapter 14), blocks, and xrefs
(Chapter 13) in a consistent fashion.
After you make standards, create a simple test drawing and make sure that
the plotted results are what you want. You’ll undoubtedly revise and extend
your standards as you go, especially on your first few projects. In time, you’ll
find a set of standards that works for you.
Cool Standards Tools
Most of the hard CAD standards work happens outside of AutoCAD — think-
ing, deciding, documenting, revising, and so on. But ultimately, you need to
translate that work into your CAD practice, and AutoCAD includes some tools
to make the job easier. Table 15-3 lists standards-related AutoCAD utilities.

Chapter 15: CAD Standards Rule

AutoCAD standards checking tools require an AutoCAD Drawing Standards
(DWS) file. You create a DWS file from a drawing with all the allowed layers,
dimension styles, text styles, and linetypes; choose File➪Save As to save it as
a DWS (not DWG) file. The DWS file defines acceptable named objects for the
Check Standards and Batch Standards Checker utilities. See “standards files,
creating” in AutoCAD’s online help system for more information.
AutoCAD 2006 monitors CAD standards compliance when you’ve specified
standards for the current drawing. By default, a balloon notification appears
from the right end of the status bar. CAD managers can trade the balloon for
a message that offers to fix the mistake. To configure the notification level,
click the Settings button in the Configure Standards dialog box.
If your company does have CAD standards in place, someone may have cre-
ated custom tools to help you comply with those standards. For example, the
CAD manager may have put together template drawings with customized set-
tings or block libraries of standard symbols. CAD managers sometimes create
custom menu choices, scripts, or utility programs for the company’s CAD
standards.

U
nless you’ve been living under a rock for the past ten years, you know
that the Internet is causing major changes in the way that people work.
(And even if you have been living under a rock, someone probably is offering
broadband service to it by now!) Because of the Net, most of us communicate
differently, exchange files more rapidly, and fill out express delivery forms
less frequently.
AutoCAD users were among the online pioneers, well before the Internet
burst onto the public scene. Despite this early adoption, the CAD world has
been relatively slow to take the full-immersion Internet plunge. Exchanging
drawings via e-mail and using the World Wide Web for CAD software research
and support are pretty common nowadays. But it’s still uncommon to find
drawings incorporated into Web pages or Web-centric CAD applications.
That’s partly because CAD drafters have traditionally been somewhat insu-
lated from the general computing community — they spend most of their
time cranking out drawings and leave all that new-fangled Web design stuff to
people who don’t have real work to get done, thank you very much! Even the
more forward-thinking CAD users tend to display a healthy, and often reason-
able, skepticism about whether any particular innovation will help with the
pressing job of getting drawings finished on deadline.
Many of the features described in this chapter have undergone frequent tin-
kering, revision, and refocusing in recent AutoCAD versions. For example,
AutoCAD 2005 added ETRANSMIT and PUBLISH capabilities to keep up with

the new sheet sets feature, which we describe in Chapter 14. The Standard
toolbar includes a Markup Set Manager for those who receive drawing
markups from users of Autodesk DWF Composer. (DWF Composer is
Autodesk’s newest effort to draw more people into using the DWF format.
The idea is that architects, engineers, and others who don’t themselves use
AutoCAD can mark up drawings by using DWF Composer and then transmit
those markups to an AutoCAD drafter, who incorporates the changes into the
DWG files.) Autodesk is aiming DWF Composer squarely at Adobe’s Acrobat
Professional and its familiar PDF file format. We discuss PDF in Chapter 18.
This chapter shows you how — and when — to use AutoCAD’s Internet fea-
tures. We also cover how the Internet features can connect with traditional
CAD tasks, such as plotting. The emphasis of this chapter is on useful, no-
nonsense ways of taking advantage of the Internet in your CAD work.
Your ticket to most of the features described in this chapter is an account
with an Internet service provider (ISP). You probably already have Internet
access through work or a private ISP account — or both; but if not, now is
the time to get connected. Other CAD users will expect to be able to send
drawings to you and receive them from you via e-mail. Software companies,
including Autodesk, expect you to have Web access in order to download
software updates and support information. Dial-up modem access to the
Internet is acceptable, but if you’re doing much drawing exchange or want
to be able to download software updates without waiting all day, consider
springing for broadband access, such as DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or
cable modem.
The Internet and AutoCAD: An Overview
As with all things Internet-y, the Internet features in AutoCAD are a hodge-
podge of the genuinely useful, the interesting but still somewhat immature
or difficult to use, and the downright foolish. We steer you toward features
and techniques that are reliable and widely used today. We warn you about
“stupid pet trick” features that may impress a 12-year-old computer geek
but leave your project leader wondering what planet you come from. On the
other hand, a few of today’s questionable features are likely to become the
reliable, commonplace ones of tomorrow. We give you enough context to
see how everything works and where it may lead. Table 16-1 summarizes
AutoCAD’s Internet features and tells you where in this book to find more
information.

Sending Strategies
E-mail and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) have largely replaced blueline prints,
overnight delivery, floppies, and higher capacity disks as the standard means
of exchanging drawings. Some companies even use specially designed Web-
based services, such as Autodesk’s Buzzsaw, as a repository for project draw-
ings from all the companies working on a particular project. Whether you’re
exchanging drawings in order to reuse CAD objects or simply to make hard-
copy plots of someone else’s drawings, you need to be comfortable sending
and receiving drawings electronically.
Sending and receiving DWG files doesn’t differ much from sending and receiv-
ing other kinds of files, except for the following:
 DWG files tend to be bigger than word processing documents and
spreadsheets. Consequently, you may need to invest in a faster Internet
connection. For instance, if you have dial-up modem access to the
Internet, you may want to consider upgrading to broadband access,
such as DSL or cable modem.
 You can easily forget to include all the dependent files. We tell you in
the next section how to make sure that you send all the necessary files —
and how to pester the people who don’t send you all their necessary files.
 It’s often not completely obvious how to plot what you receive. Read
Chapter 12 and the “Bad reception?” section, later in this chapter, to
solve plotting puzzles.
364
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

Whenever you send DWG files together, follow the Golden Exchange Rule:
“Send files unto others as you would have them sent unto you.” That means
sending all the dependent files along with the main DWG files, sending plot-
ting support files (CTB or STB files — see Chapter 12), and including a
description of what you’re sending. And ask the recipient to try opening the
drawings you sent right away, so you both have more time to respond if
there’s any problem.
Send it with ETRANSMIT
Many people naively assume that an AutoCAD drawing is always contained
in a single DWG file, but that’s often not the case. Each drawing file created in
AutoCAD can contain references to other kinds of files, the most important
of which are described in Table 16-2. Thus, before you start exchanging draw-
ings via e-mail or FTP, you need a procedure for assembling the drawings
with all their dependent files.

As you can see from the table, the consequences of not including a custom
font aren’t that dire: The recipient still will see your text, but the font will be
different. Of course, the new font may look odd or cause text spacing prob-
lems within the drawing. If, on the other hand, you forget to send xrefs or
raster graphics that are attached to your main drawing, the objects con-
tained on those attached files simply will be gone when the recipient opens
your drawing. Not good!
365
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

Table 16-2 doesn’t exhaust the types of files that your DWG files might refer
to. Custom plotter settings (such as custom paper sizes) may reside in PC3
or PMP files. If you use the new sheet sets feature, a DST file contains infor-
mation about the sheet structure. An FMP file controls some aspects of font
mapping. (Like so much else in AutoCAD, the tools and rules for mapping
missing fonts are flexible but somewhat complicated. Look up the “FONTALT”
and “FONTMAP” system variables in the AutoCAD online help system for
detailed information.)
Rapid eTransmit
Fortunately, the AutoCAD ETRANSMIT command pulls together all the files
that your main DWG file depends on. Follow these steps to assemble a draw-
ing with all its dependent files with ETRANSMIT.
1. Open the drawing that you want to run ETRANSMIT on.
If the drawing is already open, save it. ETRANSMIT requires that any
changes to the drawing be saved before you proceed.
2. Choose File➪eTransmit.
The Create Transmittal dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-1.
3. On the Files Tree or Files Table tab, remove the check mark next to
any file that you want ETRANMSIT not to copy with the main drawing.
Unless you have assigned custom font mapping, you can omit the
Acad.fmp file.
Figure 16-1:
Rapid
eTransmit.
366
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

4. Select a transmittal setup from the list.
Transmittal setups contain settings that control how ETRANSMIT
processes the drawings and creates the transmittal package. Click the
Transmittal Setups button to create new or modify existing setups. The
default Standard transmittal setup works fine for many purposes, except
that you probably want to turn on the Include Fonts setting, as described
in the next paragraph. In any case, you should view the settings (click the
Modify button) just to see what options you can change if you need to
later.
If you want AutoCAD to include SHX and TTF font files, including any
custom fonts that you’re using, you must turn on the Include Fonts set-
ting in the transmittal setup. (Click Transmittal Setups, click Modify, and
check the Include Fonts check box.) Note, however, that many SHX and
TTF files are custom fonts, which work like licensed software. Sending
them to others is just like sharing your AutoCAD program CD with
others. No, we don’t mean that it’s easy and fun; we mean that it’s illegal
and unethical. Before you send a custom font file to someone else, find
out what the licensing restrictions are on the font and be prepared to
work within them.
5. Click the View Report button.
You see a report listing the files that ETRANSMIT will copy, along with
warnings about any files that it can’t locate.
6. Review the report and make sure that ETRANSMIT was able to find all
the files.
7. Click OK.
ETRANMSIT displays a file dialog box so that you can specify the name
and location of the transmittal package.
8. Click Save.
ETRANSMIT creates the transmittal package (which is a ZIP file by
default).
Although recent versions of AutoCAD automatically compress DWG files, zip-
ping files manages to compress them even further (about 20 percent more, in
our experience). More importantly, zipping creates a single, tidy package of
all your DWG, raster image, plot style table, and font files. No one likes to
receive an e-mail message carrying an endless cargo of attached files. Do
everyone a favor: Be hip and zip.
The only downside to zipping is that creating a zipped file and extracting files
from it require a separate zip/unzip program. Several good shareware utilities
are available, including WinZip (www.winzip.com).
367
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

Transmitting multiple drawings
In many cases, you’ll want to send more than one drawing to a recipient. In
this situation, you can open each drawing and run ETRANSMIT on each in
turn. (In the transmittal setup, set Transmittal Package Type to Folder (set
of files), specify the Transmittal File Folder to copy the files to, and use
Transmittal Options to control whether the files are copied to one or more
than one folder.) When you’ve processed all the drawings, use a program like
WinZip to package the files into a single zipped file before sending it.
AutoCAD provides a slicker way of transmitting multiple drawings, as long as
you’re using the sheet sets feature (described in Chapter 14). In the Sheet Set
Manager palette, just right-click the sheet set name and choose eTransmit.
The Create Transmittal dialog box then will include an additional Sheets tab,
as shown in Figure 16-2. This tab lists all drawings in the sheet set and
includes them in the transmittal by default.
AutoCAD includes an ARCHIVE command, which functions identically to
ETRANSMIT, but without the transmittal document and without saved setups.
ARCHIVE works only with sheet sets. In the Sheet Set Manager palette, right-
click the sheet set name and choose Archive. You use this command to save
copies of a set of drawings at some milestone during a project — for example,
at a design review or bid set submittal.
FTP for you and me
FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a simple but robust protocol for copying files
over the Internet. A computer that’s connected to the Internet can act as an
FTP server, which means that part of its hard disk is accessible over the
Figure 16-2:
eTransmit
faster with
sheet sets.
368
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

Internet. The person who configures the FTP server can place restrictions so
that only people who enter a particular logon name and password can see
and download files. FTP overcomes the file size limitations that often occur
with e-mail.
Because of all these FTP benefits, it’s increasingly common for people at
larger companies to place drawing files on their company’s FTP site and tell
you to go get them. This approach relieves them of having to e-mail you the
files, and relieves you of waiting for that 10MB e-mail download when you
least expected it.
In most cases, the person making the files available to you via FTP will send
you a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that looks like a Web page address,
except that it starts with ftp:// instead of http://. If you open your Web
browser and enter the FTP URL into the address field, the browser should
connect to the FTP site, ask you for a location and name to use for the file
when it gets copied to your system, and begin downloading the file. If the FTP
site uses password protection, you’ll have to enter a logon name and pass-
word first.
If you want fancier FTP download options, you can use an FTP utility program
such as WS_FTP (www.ipswitch.com).
Even if you work for a small company, you may be able to post files on your
ISP’s FTP server in order to make them available to others. Check with your
ISP to find out whether you can do it and, if so, what the procedures are.
FTP transfers are more prone to user confusion problems than are e-mail file
attachments, especially if the recipient hasn’t used FTP before. For example,
it’s common for the person posting the files to forget to tell the recipient the
logon name and password, or for the recipient not to have an FTP program —
or to not know how to use it. Check with your recipient the first couple of times
you use FTP to transfer files to make sure he or she got the files successfully —
and don’t be surprised if the recipient asks you to use e-mail or overnight deliv-
ery instead.
Bad reception?
Other sections in this chapter focus on sending files to others. What happens
when you’re on the receiving end? Not everyone will be as conscientious as
you are about following the Golden Exchange Rule. You’ll receive drawings
with missing dependent files and no information or support files for plotting.
When you receive an e-mail message or FTP download containing drawings
(zipped, we hope!), copy the file to a new folder on your hard disk or a net-
work disk and unzip the files.
369
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

Check at least a few of the drawings in the package to make sure that all the
xrefs, fonts, and raster image files were included. You can perform this check
by opening each main drawing in that folder. After you open each file, press
the F2 key to view the command line window, and look for missing font and
xref error messages of the following sort:
Substituting [simplex.shx] for [helv.shx].
Resolve Xref “GRID”: C:\Here\There\Nowhere\grid.dwg
Can’t find C:\Here\There\Nowhere\grid.dwg
A Substituting . . . message indicates AutoCAD couldn’t find a font and is
substituting a different font for it. A Can’t find . . . message indicates that
AutoCAD couldn’t locate an xref. Any missing raster files appear as rectangu-
lar boxes with the names of the image files inside the rectangles. Alternatively,
you can open the Xref Manager or Image Manager dialog box, which reveals
any missing xref or raster image files. (See Chapter 13 for details.)
Write down each missing file and then tell the sender to get on the ball and
send you the missing pieces. While you’re at it, tell that person to buy this
book and read this chapter!
Press the F2 key after opening any drawing that you didn’t create so that you
know right away if any fonts and xrefs are missing.
If you receive drawings with custom TrueType font files (files whose exten-
sions are TTF), you must install those files before Windows and AutoCAD
will recognize them. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel. (In Windows XP,
choose Start➪Control Panel, and then click the Switch to Classic View link in
order to see the Fonts applet.) Double-click the Fonts icon to open the Fonts
window, and then choose File➪Install New Font.
Help from the Reference Manager
In Chapter 13, we warn you about the complications of xref paths and the
potential perils of AutoCAD not being able to locate xrefs if you move project
folders around or transfer drawings to or from someone else. A similar
danger exists for raster image files (Chapter 13) and font files (Chapter 9).
The ETRANSMIT command, described earlier in this chapter, does a good job
of gathering together dependent xrefs, raster files, and font files, but it can’t
gather what AutoCAD can’t locate.
AutoCAD’s Reference Manager utility is a real lifesaver if you find yourself suf-
fering from xref, raster image, or font path perils — whether they occur in
your own company or when sending files to or receiving them from others.
370

Reference Manager is a separate utility program, not a command inside
AutoCAD. Follow these steps to launch the utility:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2006➪Reference
Manager.
The Reference Manager program opens, as shown in Figure 16-3.
2. Click the Add Drawings button to add one or more DWG files to the
drawings pane on the left.
3. Click the Export Report button to create a text report listing all the
dependent files and their paths, or click the Edit Selected Paths
button to modify paths.
Click the Help button in Reference Manager to find out more about the
utility’s capabilities.
If you always keep parent and child DWG files in the same folder — the sim-
plest approach to dealing with xref paths — then you probably won’t need to
use the Reference Manager.
Drawing Web Format — 
Not Just for the Web
Earlier in this chapter, we explain how you can exchange drawings via e-mail
and FTP. That’s all the Internet connectivity that many AutoCAD users need,
but if you’re curious about connecting drawings to the Web or sharing draw-
ings with people who don’t have AutoCAD, this section is for you.

Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

The AutoCAD Web features are built on three pieces of technology:
 A special lightweight drawing format called DWF that Autodesk origi-
nally developed especially for putting drawings on the Web.
 A free program from Autodesk called Autodesk DWF Viewer that enables
anyone to view and print DWF files without having AutoCAD.
 A not-free program from Autodesk called Autodesk DWF Composer, for
marking up and reviewing DWF and DWG files. 
All about DWF
The AutoCAD DWG format works well for storing drawing information on
local and network disks, but the high precision and large number of object
properties that AutoCAD uses make for comparatively large files.
To overcome this size problem and encourage people to publish drawings
on the Web, Autodesk developed an alternative lightweight vector format for
representing AutoCAD drawings: DWF (Design Web Format). A DWF file is a
more compact representation of a DWG file. DWF uses less space — and less
transfer time over the Web and e-mail — because it’s less precise and doesn’t
have all the information that’s in the DWG file.
DWF hasn’t exactly taken the Web by storm; Autodesk has gradually recast it
as a format for electronic plotting, or ePlotting, including for sharing drawings
with people who don’t have AutoCAD. In other words, Autodesk is pushing
DWF as a CAD analogue to Adobe’s PDF (Portable Document Format). Thus,
you can create DWF files from your drawings and send the DWFs to people
who don’t have AutoCAD. Your recipients can view and plot the DWF files
after they download the free Autodesk DWF Viewer program, which is avail-

ePlot, not replot
A DWF file captures a single, plotted view of your drawing, so, unlike a DWG
file, it can provide a relatively unambiguous snapshot of what you want to
see on paper. With a DWG file, on the other hand, you have to provide lots
of information to other people — drawing view, scale, plot style settings, and
so on — in order for them to get the same plotting results that you did.
Potential ePlotting scenarios include
 Architects and other consultants on a building project periodically
upload DWF files to the project Web site. Architects and engineers with
some minimal CAD knowledge can review the drawings on-screen and
372
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

create their own hard-copy plots, if necessary. Principals and clients
who don’t want anything to do with CAD, or even with computers, can
have their employees create hard-copy plots for them to examine.
 When Internet-savvy people need hard-copy prints of your drawings,
you e-mail a zipped file containing DWF files, along with the URL for
Autodesk DWF Viewer and simple instructions for creating plots from
the DWF files. (Be ready to walk them through the process by phone the
first time or two to reduce anxiety on everyone’s part.)
 A CAD plotting service bureau encourages its customers to send DWF
files instead of DWG files for plotting. The DWF files are much smaller and
require less intervention on the part of the service bureau’s employees.
The ePlot concept debuted in AutoCAD 2000 and hasn’t yet caught on in a big
way. Autodesk hopes to establish ePlot and the DWF format as a standard for
CAD documents similar to what Adobe’s PDF has become for word process-
ing documents. It remains to be seen whether ePlotting will become a popu-
lar way to generate hard-copy output. In particular, many people outside of
CAD-using companies don’t have access to large-format plotters. They’re lim-
ited to 81⁄2-x-11-inch — or, at best, 11-x-17-inch — reduced-size check plots.
Consequently, many people won’t be able to plot your DWF files to scale, and
may not even be able to plot them large enough to read everything.
Don’t be afraid to try ePlotting with colleagues inside or outside your com-
pany, but don’t become too dependent on it until you see whether the rest of
the CAD world shares your enthusiasm. Otherwise, you risk becoming the
only one who’s willing to use your DWF files for plotting — in which case the
next version of the feature will be called mePlot.
AutoCAD 2006 uses version 6 of the DWF format, which Autodesk introduced
with AutoCAD 2004. (The DWF format changes at least as often as the DWG
format, as Autodesk adds new features to AutoCAD and new Design Web Format
capabilities.) The most important new feature in DWF 6 is multiple sheets in a
single DWF file, as shown in Figure 16-4. It’s like stapling together a set of draw-
ings, except that you never have to worry about your stapler being empty.
Making DWFs with ePlot
As we describe in the previous section, AutoCAD treats DWF files like electronic
plots, or ePlots. You create a DWF file from the current drawing just as if you
were plotting it to a piece of paper, as we describe in Chapter 12. The only dif-
ference is that, in the Plot dialog box’s Printer/Plotter area, you choose the plot-
ter configuration named DWF6 ePlot.pc3, as shown in Figure 16-5. When you
do so, AutoCAD automatically turns on the Plot to File setting. Then when you
click OK to generate the ePlot, AutoCAD displays a file dialog box in which 
you specify a filename and location for the DWF file that gets created. The
location can be a folder on a hard disk or a Web server.
373
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

When you make DWFs with ePlot, pay particular attention to the Scale setting
in the Plot Scale area. If you’re creating a DWF simply for viewing in a browser,
you can turn on the Fit to Paper setting rather than worry about a specific plot
scale. If you want to enable others to plot your DWF file to scale, as described
earlier in this chapter, you need to choose the desired plot scale factor.
Chapter 12 describes how to choose an appropriate plot scale factor.

Making DWFs (or Plots) with PUBLISH
The ePlot method of creating DWF files described in the previous section
works fine for single drawings. But if you want to create DWF files for a lot of
drawings or plot a bunch of drawings the good ol’ fashioned way (on paper,
that is), you can use the Publish dialog box, shown in Figure 16-6, to speed
the process.
Although the Publish dialog box is wired to support DWF as well as regular
(paper) plotting, for now, more people are likely to use it for paper plotting.
(An alternative use is creating plot files to send to a plotting service bureau.)
But if you do decide to go into large-scale DWF publishing, including multi-
sheet DWF files, use the Publish Drawing Sheets dialog box, as in the follow-
ing steps:
1. Choose File➪Publish.
The Publish dialog box appears (refer to Figure 16-6). The dialog box
lists all tabs (model and paper space layouts) of the current drawing for
plotting. The Publish dialog box refers to each tab as a sheet.
2. Click the buttons below the sheet list to preview any sheet, add sheets
from other drawings, remove sheets from the to-be-plotted list, or
rearrange the plotting order.
With the additional buttons, you can save and recall lists of sheets. See
Step 4 for more information.
3. After you specify the sheets that you want to plot, specify whether you
want to plot them to an actual plotter or plot (PLT) file or to a DWF file.
You can select a specific plotter configuration for each sheet by choos-
ing a Page Setup in the sheet list. See Chapter 12 for more information
about page setups.

Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

4. Click the Publish Options button to display a dialog box containing
additional settings.
Most of these options are of concern only if you’re creating DWF files.
The one exception is Default Output Directory, which also applies to 
creating plot (PLT) files.
5. Click the Save Sheet List button to save the current drawings and set-
tings list, if you anticipate having to publish the same group of draw-
ings again.
6. Click the Publish button to start the process.
AutoCAD’s sheet sets feature (described in Chapter 14) includes a direct link
to multisheet publishing. In the Sheet Set Manager palette, right-click the
sheet set name and choose Publish. The submenu includes choices for pub-
lishing directly to a plotter or DWF file and for opening the Publish dialog box
preloaded with all the sheet sets.
Don’t confuse the PUBLISH command (File➪Publish) with the PUBLISH-
TOWEB command (File➪Publish to Web). The PUBLISH command creates
sets of DWF files, plot files, or actual plots. The PUBLISHTOWEB Wizard cre-
ates a Web page containing images of your drawings. The results of this
wizard won’t put any Web designers or programmers out of work, but you
can use it to create primitive Web page paste-ups of your drawings. See 
“PUBLISHTOWEB command” in the AutoCAD online help system if you’d like
to give it a whirl.
Hand-y objects
No Web file format would be complete without hyperlinks, and DWF has those,
too. You can attach a hyperlink to any drawing object in AutoCAD, not just to a
text string. As you pass the cursor over an object with a hyperlink, the cursor
changes from the ordinary pointer to a globe and two links of a chain (as in
“World Wide Web” and “link,” not “world-wide chain gang”). Right-click the
object and select the Hyperlink option from the menu, which opens your
browser and navigates to the URL that’s attached to the object. If you create a
DWF file that includes objects with hyperlinks, Autodesk DWF Viewer embeds
the links in the DWF file so that you can Ctrl+click to navigate to them.
Hyperlinks on objects are a clever trick, but they’re of limited practical value
in most DWG and DWF files:
 The drawing images are so small that it’s difficult to distinguish the
hyperlink on one object from the hyperlink on another object.
 Most people aren’t used to associating hyperlinks with individual lines
and other objects. The interface is likely to leave them perplexed.
376
Part IV: Share and Share Alike 

If you’d like to experiment with hyperlinks in objects, look up “HYPERLINK
command, about” in the online help system.
Autodesk DWF Viewer
After you create DWF files, whether with ePlot or PUBLISH, you or the recipi-
ent of your DWF files can use Autodesk DWF Viewer to view and print them.
Autodesk DWF Viewer, shown in Figure 16-4 earlier in this chapter, is a free
viewer from Autodesk. You can download the current version from Autodesk’s
Web page, www.autodesk.com.
When you install AutoCAD 2006, the setup program by default installs
Autodesk DWF Viewer as well. Choose Start➪Programs➪Autodesk➪Autodesk
DWF Viewer, or simply double-click on a DWF file in Windows Explorer, to
launch it.
The Drawing Protection Racket
Whether you’re sending DWG or DWF files, you may be concerned about
their misuse (that is, by the wrong people or for the wrong purposes), abuse
(for example, modification without your consent), or reuse (on other projects
or by other people without due compensation to you).
AutoCAD has two features for securing your drawings when you send them to
others:
 Password protection enables you to lock a DWG or DWF file so that only
those who type the password that you’ve specified can open, insert, or
xref it.
Add password protection to drawings only when you really need it:
• If you forget the password, then you no longer will be able to open
the drawing. Neither AutoCAD nor Autodesk has any magical way
to extract the password or unlock the drawing.
• After you password-protect a drawing, others can’t insert the
drawing as a block or attach it as an xref.
If you’re using a password, you probably should do it on a copy of the
drawing that you send, and keep an unprotected version for yourself.
 Digital signature is a high-tech way to add an electronic marker to a
DWG file that verifies that someone approved the drawing. AutoCAD’s
digital signature feature relies on fairly new technology by Microsoft.
You must first get an account with a digital certificate provider, who
377
Chapter 16: Drawing on the Internet

serves to authenticate you and your computer. Of course, for this fea-
ture to be useful, you need to send drawings to someone who wants to
receive digitally authenticated drawings from you (or vice versa) and
who has the technological savvy to deal with digital certificates. For
more information, see “digital signatures, learning more about” in the
AutoCAD online help system.
To activate either of these options for the current drawing, choose File➪Save
As to display the Save Drawing As dialog box, and then choose Tools➪Security
Options to display the Security Options dialog box before you save the file. If
you want to add a digital signature and you have a digital ID from a certificate
provider, enter your information on the Digital Signature tab of the Security
Options dialog box. If you want to add a password to the current drawing, just
type it in the text field on the Password tab of the Security Options dialog box.
After you password-protect and save a DWG file, anyone who tries to open,
insert, or xref it will see a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 16-7.
To password-protect a DWF file, use the PUBLISH command and click the
Publish Options button in the Publish dialog box.
Although electronic security features such as the ones described in this 
section can be useful as part of a strategy to protect your work from
misuse, they’re not a substitute for communicating clearly, preferably in
the form of written contracts, what constitutes appropriate use of drawings
that you send to or receive from others. http://markcad.com/autocad/
elecdwgexchange.htm outlines the issues and suggests how to play well
with your drawing exchange buddies.

Chapter 17
Ten Ways to Do No Harm
H
ippocrates of Greece is famous for many things, not least of which is
the Hippocratic oath sworn by doctors. It begins “First, do no harm.”
This is not a bad approach to take when editing existing drawings with
AutoCAD, whether you or someone else originally created the drawings. You
can accidentally undo days or weeks of work by yourself and others in min-
utes. (Of course, you also can purposefully undo days or weeks of work by
yourself and others in minutes, but we can’t give much advice to stop you if
you want to do that!)
Follow these guidelines to avoid doing harm to the hard work of others and
to your own productive potential.
Be Precise
Throughout this book, we remind you that using precision techniques such
as snap, object snaps, and typed coordinates is a fundamental part of good
CAD practice. Don’t try to use AutoCAD like an illustration program, in which
you eyeball locations and distances. Use one of the many AutoCAD precision
techniques every time you specify a point or distance.
Control Properties by Layer
As we describe in Chapter 5, AutoCAD gives you two different ways of con-
trolling object properties such as color, linetype, and lineweight: by layer
and by object. Unless you have a really good reason to assign properties by
object — such as instructions from your company’s CAD manager or the
client for whom you’re creating the drawing — use the by-layer method:
Assign colors, linetypes, and lineweights to layers, and let objects inherit
their properties from the layer on which they reside. Don’t assign explicit
color, linetype, or lineweight to objects.

Know Your Drawing Scale Factor
Chapter 4 describes the importance of choosing an appropriate drawing
scale factor when you set up a drawing. Knowing the drawing scale factor of
any drawing you’re working on is equally important whether you set it up
or not. You need this number in order to calculate lots of scale-dependent
objects, such as text, dimensions, and hatching. Chapter 9 includes tips for
figuring out the drawing scale factor of an existing drawing.
Know Your Space
Understand the difference between model space and paper space (described
in Chapter 2), and know which space the different parts of the drawing you’re
looking at on-screen reside in. Above all, make sure that you draw objects in
the appropriate space. When you’re viewing a paper space layout, keep an
eye on the status bar’s MODEL/PAPER button so that you know which space
the cursor currently is in. (Chapter 4 describes how to keep your model and
paper space bearings.) When you plot, ensure that you’ve selected the right
tab — either the Model tab or one of the paper space layout tabs.
Explode with Care
The eXplode command makes it easy to explode polylines (Chapter 6), dimen-
sions (Chapter 10), hatches (Chapter 11), and block inserts (Chapter 13) into
their constituent objects. The only problem is that someone probably grouped
those objects together for a reason. So until you understand that reason and
know why it no longer applies, leave the dynamite alone.
Don’t Cram Your Geometry
It’s okay to cram for a geometry test, but don’t cram geometry, dimensions,
text, or anything (and everything) else into your drawings. You might be
tempted to put a lot of stuff into every square inch of your drawing, using
AutoCAD’s flexible panning and zooming capabilities to really work over all
the available space. If you succumb to this temptation, however, you’ll dis-
cover that editing is more difficult and adding more information may be
impossible! In addition, the result probably will be harder to read. Instead of
cramming stuff onto the sheet, use white (empty) space to surround areas of
dense geometry. Put details on separate sheets. Attach a page of notes
382
Part V: The Part of Tens 

instead of putting a ton of text onto your drawing. Managing a reasonable
number of drawings with less on each one is easier than having two or three
densely packed sheets crammed with every bit of geometry and annotation
needed for the project.
Freeze Instead of Erase
It’s common to start with an existing drawing from another discipline when
you want to add, say, an electrical system to a floor plan. But if you remove
the landscaping around a building because you don’t need it for the wiring,
you may cause a great deal of rework when the landscaping information is
needed again. And what if the person who did the landscaping work has, in
the meantime, decided to leaf? (Sorry . . . ) Unless you know that objects
are no longer needed, use the AutoCAD Freeze or Off layer setting to make
objects on those layers invisible without obliterating them. These settings
are in the Layer Properties Manager dialog box, as described in Chapter 5.
Use CAD Standards
Become knowledgeable about CAD standards in your industry and company,
and take advantage of any standardized resources and approaches that are
available to you. (See Chapter 15 for suggestions.) By following standards
consistently, you can apply your creativity, expertise, and energy to the inter-
esting parts of the job at hand, not to arguing about which hatching patterns
to use. And if you find that things are a mess in your company because no
one else pays much attention to industry standards, well, knowing those
standards makes you very employable as well.
Save Drawings Regularly
As with all computer documents that you work on, get in the habit of saving
your current AutoCAD drawing regularly. We recommend every 10 minutes or
so. Each time you save, AutoCAD writes the current state of the drawing to
the drawingname.DWG file, after renaming the previously saved version
drawingname.BAK. Thus, you can always recover the next-to-last saved ver-
sion of your drawing by renaming drawingname.BAK to somethingelse.DWG
and opening it in AutoCAD.
383
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Do No Harm

AutoCAD also includes an automatic drawing save feature. It’s useful as a sec-
ondary backup save, but you shouldn’t rely on it exclusively. AutoCAD creates
automatic save files with inscrutable names like Drawing1_1_1_1478.SV$ and
puts them in the folder specified by the Automatic Save File Location setting
on the File tab of the Options dialog box. Save your drawing and save yourself
the pain of lost work and the hassle of trying to locate the right automatic save
file. If you find yourself in the unfortunate position of needing an automatic
save file, move the SV$ files from the automatic save folder to another folder.
Rename the files from SV$ to DWG, open them in AutoCAD, and look for the
one that corresponds to the drawing you’re trying to recover. Note that
AutoCAD deletes the SV$ file after you close the drawing, so it’s usually useful
only after a software or computer crash.
Back Up Drawings Regularly
Backing up your data is prudent advice for any important work that you do
on a computer, but it’s doubly prudent for CAD drawings. A set of CAD draw-
ings is a lot harder and more time consuming to re-create than most other
computer documents (unless you’ve just written the sequel to War and
Peace, that is). Unless you’re willing to lose more than a day’s worth of work,
develop a plan of daily backups onto tape, CD-RW (CD ReWritable) discs, or
another high-capacity medium.
Don’t be lulled into complacency by the increasing reliability of hard disks.
Although hard disk failure is increasingly rare, it still happens, and if it hap-
pens to you sans backup, you’ll quickly understand the full force of the
phrase “catastrophic failure.” Also, backups aren’t just protection against
disk failure. Most of the time, backups help you recover from “pilot error” —
accidentally erasing a file, messing up a drawing with ill-advised editing, and
so on. Even if you’re conscientious and never make mistakes, there’s a good
chance that someone else in your office who has access to your DWG files
hasn’t quite achieved your exalted level of perfection. Protect your work and
minimize recriminations with regular backups.

Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data
with Other People and Programs
A
t various times, you probably need to transfer information from one
kind of document to another. You may even have taken the CAD plunge
because you want to import AutoCAD drawing data into your word process-
ing or other documents. If so, this chapter is for you. It covers exchanging
AutoCAD drawing data with other programs — what works, what doesn’t,
and how to do it. We also tell you when to give up and reach for the scissors
and glue.
This chapter frequently mentions vector and raster graphics file formats:
 A vector format stores graphics as collections of geometrical objects
(such as lines, polygons, and text). Vector graphics are good for high
geometrical precision and for stretching or squeezing images to different
sizes. These two characteristics make vector formats good for CAD.
 A raster format stores graphics as a series of dots, or pixels. Raster
graphics are good for depicting photographic detail and lots of colors.
However, you can’t squeeze or stretch raster images like you can vector
images — if you shrink them too much, you lose pixels, and if you expand
them too much, you stop seeing objects and start seeing gigantic pixels —
even if you’re not pixellated.
Exchanging AutoCAD drawing data with other programs sometimes works
great the first time you try it. Sometimes, you have to try a bunch of tech-
niques or exchange formats to get all the data to transfer in an acceptable way.
Occasionally, no practical exchange method exists for preserving formatting or
other properties that are important to you. Where your exchange efforts fall in
this spectrum depends on the kind of drawings you make, the other programs
you work with, and the output devices or formats that you use. We provide rec-
ommendations in this chapter, but be prepared to experiment.

Table 18-1 lists exchange formats between common programs and AutoCAD.

The remainder of this chapter gives you specific procedures for making most
of the exchanges recommended in this table, as well as others.
DWG
DWG, AutoCAD’s native file format, is the best format for exchanging draw-
ings with other AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT users. Use the SAVE and SAVEAS
commands to create DWG files and the OPEN command to open them.
AutoCAD LT can’t create every kind of object that AutoCAD can — raster
attachments and most 3D objects, for example — but it can successfully read
and save DWG files that contain these objects. 
386
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Out of the box, AutoCAD 2006 can’t save to the AutoCAD Release 14 DWG
format. Apparently, the Autodesk bigwigs figure that the best way to per-
suade R14 users to upgrade is to make their lives as inconvenient and iso-
lated as possible! If you need to send AutoCAD 2006 drawings to AutoCAD
R14 users, save them in R12 DXF format instead of a DWG format. (See the
“DXF” section for instructions.) If you’ve got a lot of drawings you need to
save back to R14 DWG format, you can go to Autodesk’s Web site and down-
load a copy of the Batch Drawing Converter.
Autodesk does not document the native AutoCAD DWG file format and rec-
ommends that all file exchanges between AutoCAD and other CAD programs
take place via DXF files (see the next section). But several companies have
reverse-engineered the DWG format, and it’s now common for other CAD pro-
grams to read and sometimes write DWG files directly, with greater or lesser
accuracy. Because the DWG format is complicated, isn’t documented, and
gets changed every couple of years, no one ever figures it out perfectly. Thus,
exchanging DWG files with non-Autodesk programs always involves some
compatibility risks.
When you send DWG files to other people — whether they use AutoCAD or a
different CAD program — you need to make sure that their software can read
the DWG file version that you’re sending. See Chapter 1 for information about
AutoCAD DWG file versions.
When you send DWG files to other people, remember to use the ETRANSMIT
command to ensure that you send all the dependent files (fonts, xrefs, and
raster images). See Chapter 16 for details.
387
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data with Other People and Programs
Round-trip DWG fare
The most demanding — and elusive — kind of
data exchange is called round-trip transfer.
Round-trip means that you create and save a
file in one program, edit and save it in another
program, and then edit and save it in the first
program again. A perfect round trip is one in
which all the data survives and the users of both
programs can happily edit whatever they want
to. Unfortunately, the perfect round trip, like the
perfect visit to your cousins, rarely happens. 
In CAD, round-trip transfer becomes an issue
when two people want to work on the same
drawings with different CAD programs. AutoCAD
and AutoCAD LT have excellent round-trip com-
patibility, as we explain in Chapter 1. Expect a
bumpier road if you’re exchanging drawings with
users of other CAD programs. Perform some test
transfers before you assume that your drawings
can get from here to there and back again
unscathed.

DXF
DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) is the Autodesk-approved format for
exchanging between different CAD programs. (Some other vector graphics
applications, such as drawing and illustration programs, read and write DXF
files, too.) DXF is a documented version of the DWG format. Because DXF
more-or-less exactly mimics the DWG file’s contents, it’s (usually) a faithful
representation of AutoCAD drawings.
How well DXF works for exchanging data depends largely on the other pro-
gram that you’re exchanging with. Some CAD and vector graphics programs
do a good job of reading and writing DXF files, while others don’t. In practice,
geometry usually comes through well, but properties, formatting, and other
nongeometrical information can be tricky. Test before you commit to a large-
scale exchange, and always check the results.
To create DXF files, use the SAVEAS command (File➪Save As) and choose one
of the three DXF versions in the Files of Type drop-down list. To open a DXF
file, use the OPEN command (File➪Open) and choose DXF from the Files of
Type drop-down list.
DWF
As Chapter 16 describes, DWF is Autodesk’s special “lightweight” drawing
format for posting drawings on the Web or sharing them with people who
don’t have AutoCAD. Those people can use Autodesk’s free DWF Viewer pro-
gram to view and print DWF files. Chapter 16 describes how to create and use
DWF files.
PDF
Adobe’s PDF (Portable Document Format) is the most popular format for
exchanging formatted text documents among users of different computers
and operating systems. PDF also does graphics, as you probably know from
having viewed PDF brochures on Web sites. 
Autodesk has worked hard to make DWF the PDF for CAD drawing exchange,
but DWF hasn’t yet caught on in a big way. When AutoCAD users need to
send drawings to people who don’t have AutoCAD, many prefer to convert
the drawings to PDF files. Most potential recipients are familiar with PDF and
already have the free Adobe Reader installed on their computers, neither of
which can be said of DWF.
388
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Each format has its strengths and weaknesses. PDF files tend to be much larger
than DWFs, while DWFs tend to include more of the drawing’s intelligence.
Current versions of both formats support layering information, markup, and
measuring tools. Both formats are competent and efficient means of sharing
drawing data, but there’s no question that PDF is more prevalent.
If you’re reading this book, you probably already have the software for creat-
ing DWF files — AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. The free Adobe Reader views and
prints PDF files, but won’t create them. In order to convert an AutoCAD draw-
ing (or any other Windows document) into a PDF file, you’ll need additional
software. Adobe sells Acrobat Standard and Professional for this purpose; see
www.adobe.com/acrobat for details and a trial version. Many other compa-
nies offer commercial and shareware PDF-creation programs. One such utility
is Pdf995 (www.pdf995.com), which, despite its under-$10 price, does a good
job of creating PDF files from AutoCAD drawings.
WMF
There are lots of different vector and raster graphics file formats, but Microsoft
has been pretty successful at making its WMF and BMP formats the lingua
franca — or should that be lingua bill-a? — for exchanging graphical informa-
tion in Windows. 
WMF (Windows MetaFile) is a vector format, so it does a decent job of repre-
senting AutoCAD objects such as lines, arcs, and text. 
To create a WMF file showing some or all the objects in a drawing, use the
EXPORT command (File➪Export) and choose Metafile (*.wmf) in the Files
of Type drop-down list. After you create a WMF file in AutoCAD, use the other
program’s file insertion command to place the image in a document. 
AutoCAD puts objects in the WMF file with the colors and display lineweights
that you see on the AutoCAD screen. To create a WMF file that looks like a
monochrome plot — that is, with varying lineweights and all objects black —
you need to set layer and object properties in AutoCAD so the objects look
that way on-screen before you create the WMF file. 
You can go the other direction, from a WMF file into AutoCAD, by using the
WMFIN command (Insert➪Windows Metafile).
389
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data with Other People and Programs

BMP, JPEG, TIFF, and Other
Raster Formats
BMP (BitMaP) is the standard Windows raster format. AutoCAD can create
BMP files from drawing objects (via the EXPORT command) and place BMP
files in drawings (via the IMage command). When you export AutoCAD draw-
ing objects to a BMP file, all the objects get converted to dots. Turning a line
into a bunch of dots isn’t a swell idea if you want to change the line again. But
it is useful if you need to copy a drawing into a company brochure.
One problem with BMP files is their big file size. Unlike some other raster for-
mats, BMP doesn’t offer compression. Because CAD drawings usually are
fairly large in area, they can turn into monstrously large BMP files.
Creating a BMP file showing some or all the objects in a drawing is just like
creating a WMF file: Use the EXPORT command (File➪Export) but choose
Bitmap (*.bmp) in the Files of Type drop-down list. After you create a BMP
file in AutoCAD, you use the other program’s File➪Open to open it or the
graphics file insertion command to place it in an existing document.
If you want to go the other direction and bring a BMP file into an AutoCAD
drawing, use the IMage command (not in AutoCAD LT), as described in
Chapter 13.
Although BMP is a standard Windows format for exchanging raster data, it’s
certainly not the preferred format of many programs. Other common raster
formats include PNG, PCX, JPEG, and TIFF (the latter two appear as JPG and
TIF in Windows). Among their other advantages, these formats offer image
compression, which can reduce the size of raster files dramatically. 
If the program that you’re trying to work with works best with other formats,
or you want to avoid huge BMP files, you have a couple of options:
 Create an AutoCAD-friendly format (such as WMF or BMP) and translate
it to another graphics format with a translation program such as HiJaak
(www.imsisoft.com) or VuePrint (www.hamrick.com).
AutoCAD includes JPGOUT, PNGOUT, and TIFOUT commands for creat-
ing JPG, PNG, and TIF files in the same way that you export WMF and
BMP files. Type the command name, press Enter, specify a raster file-
name, and select the objects to be included in the image file. These 
commands use the current drawing area background color as the back-
ground color for the image. If you want your image background to be
white, make sure that the AutoCAD drawing area color is white when
390
Part V: The Part of Tens 

you run the command. (Choose Tools➪Options➪Display➪Colors to
change display colors.) 
 If you need to convert drawings to a raster format other than BMP or
TIF, the second option is to use the AutoCAD Raster File Format driver.
This driver enables you to “plot” to a file with one of nine raster formats,
including PCX, JPEG, and TIFF. Before you can use the Raster File Format
driver, you must create a new plotter configuration: Choose File➪Plotter
Manager and then run the Add-A-Plotter Wizard. After you create the
Raster File Format driver configuration, you use the Plot dialog box as
described in Chapter 12 to generate “plots” to raster files.
To go the other direction, raster image file into an AutoCAD drawing, use the
IMage command, as described in Chapter 13.
Windows Clipboard
If you need to transfer lots of WMF or BMP figures, you can do it a bit more
quickly with the Windows Clipboard, which bypasses the creation of WMF
and BMP files on disk. Instead, Windows uses your computer’s memory to
transfer the data. Choose Edit➪Copy in the program from which you want to
copy the data, and then choose Edit➪Paste Special in the program into which
you want to paste it. In the Paste Special dialog box, choose Picture to paste
the image in WMF format or Bitmap to paste it in BMP format.
AutoCAD (but not AutoCAD LT) has a set of image manipulation commands.
You can clip images, turn their borders off and on, and generally treat them
like regular AutoCAD objects. However, these image commands work only if
you use the IMage command to load the raster image. If you paste from the
Windows Clipboard, the image comes into AutoCAD as an OLE object (see
the next section), not as an image object, and the additional image com-
mands do not work on OLE objects.
OLE
Microsoft Windows includes a data transfer feature, Object Linking and
Embedding, or OLE. (In case you’re wondering, that’s “OLE” pronounced like
the Spanish cheer, not like the Cockney way of saying hole.) Microsoft touts
OLE as an all-purpose solution to the challenge of exchanging formatted data
between any two Windows programs. 
391
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data with Other People and Programs

If you want to share data between two OLE-aware programs (and most
Windows applications are OLE-aware), creating an embedded or linked docu-
ment shouldn’t be much more complicated than cut and paste. That’s the
theory. 
Here’s how it works. In OLE lingo, the program that you’re taking the data from
is the source. The program that receives the data is called the container. For
example, if you want to place some word processing text from Microsoft Word
into an AutoCAD drawing, Word is the source, and AutoCAD is the container.
In Word, you select the text that you want to put in the AutoCAD drawing and
choose Edit➪Copy to copy it to the Windows Clipboard. Then, you switch to
AutoCAD and choose Edit➪Paste Special. The Paste Special choice displays a
dialog box containing the choices Paste and Paste Link. The Paste option cre-
ates a copy of the object from the source document and embeds the copied
object into the container document. The Paste Link option links the new
object in the container document to its source document so any changes to
392
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Should you shout, “OLE!”?
Unfortunately, OLE is afflicted with several prac-
tical problems: 
 Compound OLE documents can slow 
performance — a lot. If you plan to use OLE,
you should have a fast computer with lots
of memory — or lots of time on your hands. 
 Supporting OLE well is a difficult program-
ming job, and many applications, including
AutoCAD, suffer from OLE design limitations
and bugs. (For example, when you link or
embed a word processing document, only
the first page appears in AutoCAD.)
 In versions of AutoCAD prior to AutoCAD
2005, plotted OLE output often underwent
creative but undesirable transformations. If
you exchange drawings with users of ear-
lier versions, what they see on the screen
and plot may not match what you created.
AutoCAD 2005 and 2006 include a bevy of OLE
improvements, which address some of the 
limitations:
 You can control text size more easily, via the
MSOLESCALE system variable and OLE-
SCALE command.
 Editing of OLE objects with commands such
as Move and CoPy is more consistent with
editing of native AutoCAD objects. 
 You can control the quality of plotted OLE
objects with a setting on the Plot and
Publish tab of the Options dialog box.
Even with the recent OLE improvements, you
should consider carefully and test extensively
before embedding or linking documents into
drawings. If you want to play it safe, use the
alternative methods described in this chapter,
and save OLE for your next trip to Spain.

the source document are automatically reflected in the container document.
In other words, if you link word processing text to an AutoCAD drawing,
changes that you make later in the Word document get propagated to the
AutoCAD drawing automatically. If you embed the same text object in an
AutoCAD drawing, changes that you later make to the text in Word aren’t
reflected in the AutoCAD drawing.
That’s how it’s supposed to work. In practice, the container application some-
times doesn’t display or print all the linked or embedded data correctly. See
the “Should you shout, ‘OLE!’?” sidebar for details.
Screen Capture
If your goal is to show the entire AutoCAD program window, not just the
drawing contained in it, create a screen capture. Most of the figures in this
book are screen captures. You might use similar figures to put together a
training manual or to show your mom all the cool software you use.
Windows includes a no-frills screen capture capability that is okay for an
occasional screen capture. It works like this:
1. Capture the whole screen or active window with one of these steps:
• Press the Print Screen key to capture the entire Windows screen,
including the desktop and taskbar. 
• Hold down the Alt key and press the Print Screen key to capture
just the active program window (for example, AutoCAD). 
Windows copies a bitmap image to the Windows Clipboard. 
2. Paste the bitmap image into another program. You have two options:
• Paste into a paint program (such as the Paint program in
Windows). Use that program to save a raster image as a BMP file
format. 
• Paste the bitmap image directly into a document (such as a Word
document or an AutoCAD drawing) without creating another file.
If you do lots of captures, a screen capture utility program makes the job
faster and gives you more options. You can control the area of the screen that
gets captured, save to different raster file formats with different monochrome,
grayscale, and color options, and print screen captures. Two good screen cap-
ture utility programs are FullShot by Inbit, Inc. (www.inbit.com) and SnagIt
by TechSmith Corp. (www.techsmith.com).
393
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Swap Drawing Data with Other People and Programs

When you create screen captures, pay attention to resolution and colors:
 High screen resolutions (for example, above 1280 x 1024) can make your
captures unreadable when they get compressed onto an 81⁄2-x-11-inch
sheet of paper and printed on a low-resolution printer. 
 Some colors don’t print in monochrome, and a black AutoCAD drawing
area is overwhelmingly dark. For most of the screen captures in this
book, we used 1024 x 768 resolution, a white AutoCAD drawing area, and
dark colors — mostly black — for all the objects in the drawing.
TXT and RTF
TXT (Text, also called ASCII for American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) is the simplest format for storing letters and numbers. TXT files
store only basic text, without such formatting as boldface or special paragraph
characteristics. RTF (Rich Text Format) is a format developed by Microsoft for
exchanging word processing documents (text plus formatting).
Pasting text from a word processor brings it into your drawing in exactly the
form it appeared in the word processor document. So far, so good. However,
what you’ve just pasted is another one of those troublesome OLE objects —
you can’t edit it in AutoCAD’s Multiline Text Editor because it’s not AutoCAD
text. The solution is to save the word-processed text in Rich Text Format
(RTF). Then start AutoCAD’s mText command, right-click inside the Multiline
Text Editor window, and choose Import Text. Find the RTF file and click OK.
The word-processed text is now AutoCAD text. When you import an RTF file,
AutoCAD even brings along most of the text formatting and alignment.
Chapter 9 covers the Multiline Text Editor window.
Because no rational person would use AutoCAD as a word processor, AutoCAD
doesn’t provide any special tools for exporting text. You can select AutoCAD
text, copy it to the Windows Clipboard, and then paste it into another program.
