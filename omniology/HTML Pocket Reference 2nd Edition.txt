HTML Pocket Reference
Introduction
This pocket reference provides a concise, yet thorough, list-
ing of HTML tags and attributes specified by the W3C
HTML 4.01 Specification, Netscape Navigator, and Internet
Explorer.
Using This Book
The majority of this reference is an alphabetical listing of tags
and their attributes with explanations and browser support
information.
The “Tag Groups” section lists tags that are related in func-
tionality, and “Tag Structures” provides examples of how
standard web page elements are constructed.
At the end of the book are useful charts, including character
entities and decimal to hexadecimal conversions.
For Further Reading
More in-depth explanations of HTML and web design can be
found in O’Reilly & Associates’ Web Design in a Nutshell by
Jennifer Niederst and HTML and XHTML: The Definitive
Guide by Chuck Musciano and Bill Kennedy. Also useful is
Webmaster in a Nutshell by Stephen Spainhour and Robert
Eckstein.

HTML Pocket Reference
The browser support information in this book was provided
by the HTML Compendium created by Ron Woodall. I
encourage you to check out the Compendium’s site (http://
www.htmlcompendium.org) for extremely in-depth explana-
tions of HTML tags, attributes, and values and the browsers
that support them.
Conventions Used in This Book
The correct syntax appears to the right of each tag and indi-
cates whether the tag is a container (with an end tag) or
stands alone. Browser support information is indicated
below each tag. Browsers that do not support the tag are
shown in gray. Attribute support is indicated in italics in the
attribute description.
Tag Groups
The following lists group HTML tags by similar function. See
the “Alphabetical Tag List” section for complete descrip-
tions of each tag.
Structural Tags
The following tags are used primarily to give the document
structure.
<!DOCTYPE>
<base>
<body>
<head>
<html>
<link>
<meta>
<title>

Client-Side Imagemap
In the example below, the image graphic.gif is an imagemap
that contains two clickable areas and uses the client-side
imagemap named map1.
<MAP NAME="map1">
        <AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="123,20,234,40"
        HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/">
        <AREA SHAPE="circ" COORDS="111,50,25"
        HREF="index.html">
</MAP>
<IMG SRC="graphic.gif" USEMAP="map1">
Basic Table
The following HTML sample shows the basic structure for a
simple four-cell table. The number of columns is determined
by the number of cells (<td>) that appear within each row
(<tr>). The table in the example below has two rows and two
columns.
<TABLE>
   <TR>
      <TD></TD>
      <TD></TD>
   </TR>
   <TR>
      <TD></TD>
      <TD></TD>
   </TR>
</TABLE>
Framed Document
The following code creates a framed document with two
frames, side by side. The number of columns is established
by the number of measurements listed in the cols attribute.
To create a framed document with horizontal frames, use the
ROWS attribute. For instance, <FRAMESET ROWS="*,*,*"> creates
,ch01.29067  Page 10  Monday, January 7, 2002  1:09 PM

a framed document with three horizontal frames of equal
height.
<HTML>
   <HEAD>
      <TITLE>Frame Document</TITLE>
   </HEAD>
   <FRAMESET COLS="*,*">
      <FRAME SRC="doc1.html">
      <FRAME SRC="doc2.html">
   </FRAMESET>
   <NOFRAMES>Your browser does not support frames.
</NOFRAMES>
</HTML>
Nested frames
You can place one frameset within another as shown in the
following example.
<FRAMESET COLS="*,*">
   <FRAME SRC="doc1.html">
   <FRAMESET ROWS="50,150">
      <FRAME SRC="doc2.html">
      <FRAME SRC="doc3.html">
</FRAMESET>
Adding Style Sheet Information
There are three methods for adding style sheet information
to a document.
External style sheets:
<HEAD>
   <LINK rel="stylesheet" href="url of css file"
   type="text/css">
</HEAD>
Embedded style sheets:
<HEAD>
   <STYLE type="text/css">
   <!--
      selector {property: value}

   -->
   </STYLE>
</HEAD>
Inline styles (using the style attribute in an element tag):
<ELEMENT style="property: value">...</ELEMENT>
Example:
<H1 style="color: blue; font-size: 18pt;">...</H1>
Alphabetical Tag List
A number of attributes in the HTML 4.01 specification are
shared by nearly all elements. To save space, they have been
abbreviated in this book as they are in the specification as
follows.
%coreattrs indicates the collection of core HTML attributes
according to the HTML 4.01 specification:
id
Assigns a unique identifying name to the element
class
Assigns a classification name to the element
style
Associated style information
title
Advisory title/amplification
%i18n stands for “internationalization” (i + 18 characters + n)
and includes attributes related to making documents and ele-
ments accessible in all languages:
lang
Specifies the language for the element by its two-
character language code
dir
Specifies the direction of the element; values are ltr
(left to right) or rtl (right to left)

4.01 Document Type Definition) used by scripting lan-
guages which are applicable to the element:
onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup,
onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress,
onkeydown, onkeyup

Defines an anchor within the document. An anchor is used to link
to another document or web resource. It can also serve to label a
fragment within a document (also called a named anchor), which
serves as a destination anchor for linking to a specific point in an
HTML document.
Attributes
The attributes labeled “HTML 4.01” are new to the HTML 4.01
specification and are generally supported only by Internet
Explorer 5.5 and higher and Netscape 6.

HTML Pocket Reference
accesskey=character
HTML 4.01. Assigns an access key (shortcut key command)
to the link. Access keys are also used for form fields. The
value is a single character. Users may access the element by
hitting Alt-key (PC) or Ctrl-key (Mac).
charset=charset
HTML 4.01. Specifies the character encoding of the target
document.
coords=x,y coordinates
HTML 4.01. Specifies the x,y coordinates for a clickable area
in an imagemap. HTML 4.0 proposes that client-side
imagemaps be replaced by an <object> tag containing the
image and a set of anchor tags defining the “hot” areas (with
shapes and coordinate attributes). This system has not yet
been implemented by browsers.
href=url
Specifies the URL of the destination HTML document or web
resource (such as an image, audio, PDF, or other media file).
hreflang=language code
HTML 4.01. Specifies the base language of the target
document.
id=text
Gives the link a unique name (similar to the name attribute) so
it can be referenced from a link, script, or style sheet. It is
more versatile than
name, but it is not as universally
supported.
name=text
Places a fragment identifier within an HTML document.
rel=relationship
Establishes a relationship between the current document and
the
target
document.
Common
relationships
include
stylesheet, next, prev, copyright, index, and glossary.
rev=relationship
Specifies the relationship from the target back to the source
(the opposite of the rev attribute).

15
shape=rect|circle|poly|default
HTML 4.01. Defines the shape of a clickable area in an
imagemap. This is only used in the <a> tag as part of HTML
4.01’s proposal to replace client-side imagemaps with a
combination of <object> and <a> tags. This system has not yet
been implemented by browsers.
tabindex=number
HTML 4.01. Specifies the position of the current element in
the tabbing order for the current document. The value must
be between 0 and 32,767. It is used for tabbing through the
links on a page (or fields in a form).
target=text
Not supported by WebTV or Internet Explorer 2.0 and earlier.
Specifies the name of the window or frame in which the target
document should be displayed.
title=text
Specifies a title for the target document. May be displayed as
a “tool tip.”
type=MIME type
Specifies the content type (MIME type) of the defined
content.
Link Examples
To a local file:
<A HREF="filename.html">...</A>
To an external file:
<A HREF="http://server/path/file.html">...</A>
To a named anchor:
<A HREF="http://server/path/file.html#fragment">...</A>
To a named anchor in the current file:
<A HREF="#fragment">...</A>
To send an email message:

Deprecated. This tag (first introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0)
is used to place a Java applet on the web page. <applet> and all its
attributes have been deprecated in favor of the <object> element,
but it is still widely used. Some applets require the use of the
<applet> tag. Furthermore, Navigator 4 and earlier and Internet
Explorer 4 do not support Java applets via object tags.
Attributes
%coreattrs
align=left|right|top|middle|bottom
Aligns the applet and allows text to wrap around it (same as
image alignment).
alt=text
Provides alternate text if the applet cannot be displayed.
archive=urls
Provides a space-separated list of URLs with classes to be
preloaded.
code=class
Required. Specifies the class name of the code to be executed.

hspace=number
Holds number pixels space clear to the left and right of the
applet window.
name=text
Names the applet for reference from elsewhere on the page.
object=text
Names a resource containing a serialized representation of an
applet’s state. It is interpreted relative to the applet’s code-
base. The serialized data contains the applet’s class name but
not the implementation. The class name is used to retrieve the
implementation from a class file or archive. Either code or
object must be present. If both code and object are given, it is
an error if they provide different class names.
vspace=number
Holds number pixels space clear above and below the applet
window.
width=number
Required. Width of the initial applet display area in pixels.

Enclosed text is a “blockquote” (lengthy quotation), which is
generally displayed with an indent on the left and right margins
and added space above and below the paragraph.
Note that:
• Some older browsers display blockquote material in italic,
making it difficult to read.
• Browsers are inconsistent in the way they display images
within blockquotes. Some align the graphic with the indented
blockquote margin; others align the image with the normal
margin of paragraph text. It is a good idea to test on a variety
of browsers.

bordercolor="#rrggbb" or color name
Nonstandard. Sets the color for the frame’s borders (if the
border is turned on). Support for this attribute is limited to
Netscape Navigator 3.0+ and Internet Explorer 4.0+.
frameborder=1|0 (IE 3+ and W3C 4.0 Spec.); yes|no (NN 3+ and
IE 4.0+)
Determines whether there is a 3D separator drawn between
the current frame and surrounding frames. A value of 1 (or
yes) turns the border on. A value of 0 (or no) turns the border
off. The default value is 1 (border on). You may also set the
frameborder at the frameset level, which may be more
reliable.
Because Netscape and Internet Explorer support different
values, you need to specify the frameborder twice within
<frame> to ensure full browser compatibility, as follows:
frameborder=yes frameborder=1 ...
longdesc=url
Specifies a link to a document containing a long descrip-
tion of the frame and its contents. This addition to the
HTML 4.01 specification may be useful for nonvisual web
browsers, but it is currently not well supported.
marginwidth=number
Specifies the amount of space (in pixels) between the left and
right edges of the frame and its contents. The minimum value
according to the HTML specification is 1 pixel. Setting the
value to 0 in order to place objects flush against the edge of
the frame works in Internet Explorer, but Netscape will still
display a 1-pixel margin space.
marginheight=number
Specifies the amount of space (in pixels) between the top and
bottom edges of the frame and its contents. The minimum
value according to the HTML specification is 1 pixel. Setting
the value to 0 in order to place objects flush against the edge
of the frame works in Internet Explorer, but Netscape will still

(char) on each line. If a line doesn’t use an alignment char-
acter, it should be horizontally shifted to end at the alignment
position. This attribute is generally not supported by current
browsers.
valign=top|middle|bottom|baseline
Deprecated. Specifies vertical alignment of cell contents.

Defines a table data cell. The end tag is not required but may
prevent unpredictable table display, particularly if the cell
contains images. A table cell can contain any content, including
another table.
Attributes
%coreattrs, %i18n, %events
align=left|center|right|justify|char
Deprecated. Specifies horizontal alignment (or justification) of
cell contents. The default value is left.

background=url
Specifies a graphic image to be used as a tile within the cell.
Netscape’s documentation does not cover this tag, but it is
supported by version 4.0.
bgcolor="#rrggbb" or color name
Specifies a color to be used in the table cell. A cell’s back-
ground color overrides colors specified at the row or table
levels.
colspan=number
Specifies the number of columns the current cell should span.
The default value is 1. According to the HTML 4.01 specifica-
tion, the value zero (0) means the current cell spans all
columns from the current column to the last column in the
table; in reality, however, this feature is not supported in
current browsers.
height=number, percentage
Deprecated. Specifies the height of the cell in number of pixels
or by a percentage value relative to the table height. The
height specified in the first column will apply to the rest of the
cells in the row. The height values need to be consistent for
cells in a particular row. Pixel measurements are more reli-
able than percentages, which only work when the height of
the table is specified in pixels.
nowrap
Deprecated. Disables automatic text wrapping for the current
cell. Line breaks must be added with a <br> or by starting a
new paragraph. This attribute is only supported in Internet
Explorer 5 and higher.
rowspan=number
Specifies the number of rows spanned by the current cell. The
default value is 1. According to the HTML 4.01 specification,
the value zero (0) means the current cell spans all rows from
the current row to the last row; in reality, however, this
feature is not supported by any browsers.
valign=top|middle|bottom|baseline
Deprecated. Specifies the vertical alignment of the text (or
other elements) within the table cell. The default is middle.

width=number
Deprecated. Specifies the width of the cell in number of pixels
or by a percentage value relative to the table width. The width
specified in the first row will apply to the rest of the cells in
the column, and the values need to be consistent for cells in
the column.
Internet Explorer only
bordercolor="#rrggbb" or color name
Defines the border color for the cell.
bordercolorlight="#rrggbb" or color name
Defines the dark shadow color for the cell border.
bordercolordark="#rrggbb" or color name
Defines the light highlight color of the cell border.
New in HTML 4.01
These attributes are part of the HTML standard but are not
supported by current browsers.
abbr=text
Provides an abbreviated form of the cell’s content.
axis=text
Places a cell into a conceptual category, which could then be
used to organize or search the table in different ways.
char=character
Specifies a character along which the cell contents will be
aligned. The default character is a decimal point (language-
appropriate).
charoff=length
Specifies the offset distance to the first alignment character
(char) on each line. If a line doesn’t use an alignment char-
acter, it should be horizontally shifted to end at the alignment
position.
headers=id reference
Lists header cells (by id) that provide header information for
the current data cell. This is intended to make tables more
accessible to nonvisual browsers.

scope=row|col|rowgroup|colgroup
Specifies the table cells for which the current cell provides
header information. A value of col indicates that the current
cell is the header for all the cells that fall below. colgroup indi-
cates the current cell is the header for the column group that
contains it. A value of row means that the current cell is the
header for the cells in the rest of the row. rowgroup means the
current cell is the header for the containing rowgroup. This is
intended to make tables more accessible to nonvisual
browsers.
<textarea>
<textarea>...</textarea>
NN 2, 3, 4, 6
MSIE 2, 3, 4, 5.5, 6
HTML 4.01

Opera5
Defines a multiline text-entry control. The text that is enclosed
within the <textarea> tags is displayed in the text-entry field when
the form initially displays.
Attributes
%coreattrs, %i18n, %events, onblur, onfocus, onchange
accesskey=single character
Assigns an access key to the element. Pressing the access key
gives focus to (jumps to and highlights) the element.
cols=number
Required. Specifies the visible width of the text-entry field,
measured in number of characters. Users may enter text lines
that are longer than the provided width, in which case the
entry scrolls to the right (or wraps if the browser provides
some mechanism for doing so).
disabled
Disables the form element for user input.
name=text
Required. Specifies a name for the text input control. This
name will be sent along with the control content to the form-
processing application.

rows=number
Required. Specifies the height of the text-entry field in number
of lines of text. If the user enters more lines than are visible,
the text field scrolls down to accommodate the extra lines.
tabindex=number
Assigns the position of the current element in the tabbing
order for the current document.
wrap=off|virtual|physical
Nonstandard. Sets word wrapping within the text area. off
turns word wrapping off; users must enter their own line
returns. virtual displays the wrap, but the line endings are
not transmitted to the server. physical displays and transmits
line endings to the server. Some browsers support the propri-
etary value soft as equivalent to virtual, and hard as
equivalent to physical.

Character Entity Chart
Characters not found in the normal alphanumeric character
set, such as © or &, must be specified in HTML using char-
acter entities. Character entities can be defined by name
(&name;) or by numeric value (&#nnn;). The browser inter-
prets the string to display the proper character. Named enti-
ties are preferable because numeric values may be interpreted
differently on different platforms.
Unless otherwise noted, the character entities are part of the
HTML 2.0 and later standards and will work with nearly all
available browsers. A “4.01” in the character’s description
indicates that character entity is part of the HTML 4.0 Speci-
fication and is supported only by Internet Explorer and Navi-
gator versions 4.0 and higher. An “N” in the description
indicates that the character is a nonstandard entity.
