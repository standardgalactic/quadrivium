Primes and modular arithmetic
Primes
Introduction
A prime number (or prime for short) is a natural number that can only be wholly divided by 1
and itself. For theoretical reasons, the number 1 is not considered a prime (we shall see why
later on in this chapter). For example, 2 is a prime, 3 is prime, and 5 is prime, but 4 is not a
prime because 4 divided by 2 equals 2 without a remainder.
The first 20 primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71.
Primes are an endless source of fascination for mathematicians. Some of the problems
concerning primes are so difficult that even decades of work by some of the most brilliant
mathematicians have failed to solve them. One such problem is Goldbach's conjecture, which
states that all even numbers greater than 3 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
Geometric meaning of primes
Let's start with an example. Given 12 pieces of square floor tiles, can we assemble them into a
rectangular shape in more than one way? Of course we can, this is due to the fact that
We do not distinguish between 2×6 and 6×2 because they are essentially equivalent
arrangements.
But what about the number 7? Can you arrange 7 square floor tiles into rectangular shapes in
more than one way? The answer is no, because 7 is a prime number.
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
A theorem is a non-obvious mathematical fact. A theorem must be proven; a proposition that is
generally believed to be true, but without a proof, is called a conjecture.
With those definitions out of the way the fundamental theorem of arithmetic simply states that:
Any natural number (except for 1) can be expressed as the product of primes in one and only
one way.
For example

6
Rearranging the multiplication order is not considered a different representation of the number,
so there is no other way of expressing 12 as the product of primes.
A few more examples
A number that can be factorised into more than 1 prime factor is a called a composite number
(or composite for short). Composite is the opposite of prime.
Think about it
Bearing in mind the definition of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, why isn't the number 1
considered a prime?
Factorisation
We know from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that any integer can be expressed as the
product of primes. The million dollar question is: given a number x, is there an easy way to find
all prime factors of x?
If x is a small number that is easy. For example 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5. But what if x is large? For
example x = 4539? Most people can't factorise 4539 into primes in their heads. But can a
computer do it? Yes, the computer can factorise 4539 in no time. In fact 4539 = 3 × 17 × 89.
There is, indeed, an easy way to factorise a number into prime factors. Just apply the method to
be described below (using a computer). However, that method is too slow for large numbers:
trying to factorise a number with thousands of digits would take more time than the current age
of the universe. But is there a fast way? Or more precisely, is there an efficient way? There may
be, but no one has found one yet. Some of the most widely used encryption schemes today
(such as RSA) make use of the fact that we can't factorise large numbers into prime factors
quickly. If such a method is found, a lot of internet transactions will be rendered unsafe. So if
you happen to be the discoverer of such a method, don't be too forthcoming in publishing it,
consult your national security agency first!
Since computers are very good at doing arithmetic, we can work out all the factors of x by
simply instructing the computer to divide x by 2 and then 3 then by 5 then by 7 then by 11 ...
and so on, and check whether at any point the result is a whole number. Consider the following
three examples of the dividing method in action.
Example 1
x = 21
x / 2 = 10.5 not a whole number

7
x / 3 = 7 hence 3 and 7 are the factors of 21.
Example 2
x = 153
x / 2 = 76.5 hence 2 is not a factor of 153
x / 3 = 51 hence 3 and 51 are factors of 153
51 / 3 = 17 hence 3 and 17 are factors of 153
It is clear that 3, 9, 17 and 51 are the factors of 153. The prime factors of 153 are 3, 3 and 17
(3×3×17 = 153)
Example 3
2057 / 2 = 1028.5
...
2057 / 11 = 187
187 / 11 = 17
hence 11, 11 and 17 are the prime factors of 2057.

Fun Fact -- Is this prime?
Interestingly, due to recent developments, we can tell quickly, with the help of a computer
program, whether a number is prime with 100% accuracy.

8
2, 5 and 3
The primes 2, 5, and 3 hold a special place in factorisation. Firstly, all even numbers have 2 as
one of their prime factors. Secondly, all numbers whose last digit is 0 or 5 can be divided
wholly by 5.
The third case, where 3 is a prime factor, is the focus of this section. The underlying question
is: is there a simple way to decide whether a number has 3 as one of its prime factors? Yes. See
the following theorem
Theorem - Divisibility by 3
A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3
E.g. 272 is not divisible by 3, because 2+7+2=11. And 11 isn't divisible by 3.
945 is divisible by 3, because 9+4+5 = 18. And 18 is divisible by 3. In fact 945 / 3 = 315
Is 123456789 divisible by 3?
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = (1 + 9) × 9 / 2 = 45
4 + 5 = 9
Nine is divisible by 3, therefore 45 is divisible by 3, therefore 123456789 is divisible by 3!
(That this method works is a theorem, though the proof is not given here.)
The beauty of the theorem lies in its recursive nature. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if
the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. How do we know whether the sum of its digits is divisible
by 3? Apply the theorem again! It's too true that "... to recurse, [is] divine".
Try a few more numbers yourself.
info -- Recursion
A prominent computer scientist once said "To iterate is human, to recurse, divine." But
what does it mean to recurse? Before that, what is to iterate? "To iterate" simply means
doing the same thing over and over again, and computers are very good at that. An example
of iteration in mathematics is the exponential operation, e.g. xn means doing x times x times
x times x...n times. That is an example of iteration. Thinking about iteration economically
(in terms of mental resources), by defining a problem in terms of itself, is "to recurse". To
recursively represent xn, we write:
xn = 1 if n equals 0.
if n > 0

9
What is 99? That is 9 times 9 8. But what is 98, it is 9 times 97. Repeating this way is an
example of recursion.

Finding primes
The prime sieve is a relatively efficient method of finding all primes less than or equal to a
specified number. Let say we want to find all primes less than or equal to 50.
First we write out all numbers between 0 and 51 in a table as below
Cross out 1, because it's not a prime.
Now 2 is the smallest number not crossed out in the table. We mark 2 as a prime and cross out
all multiples of 2 i.e. 4, 6, 8, 10 ...

10
Now 3 is the smallest number not marked in anyway. We mark 3 as a prime and cross out all
multiples of 3 i.e. 6, 9, 12, 15 ...
Continue is this way to find all the primes. When do you know you have found all the primes
under 50?
Exercise
1.
The prime sieve has been applied to the table above. Notice that every number situated directly
below 2 and 5 are crossed out. Construct a rectangular grid of numbers running from 1 to 60 so
that after the prime sieve has been performed on it, all numbers situated directly below 3 and 5
are crossed out. What is the width of the grid?
2. Find all primes below 200
Infinitely many primes
We know some numbers can be factorised into primes. Some have only themselves as a prime
factor, because they are prime. So how many primes are there? There are infinitely many! Here
is a classical proof of the infinitude of primes dating back 2000 years to the ancient Greek
mathematician Euclid:

11
Proof of infinitude of primes
Let us first assume that
there are a finite number of primes
therefore
there must be one prime that is greater than all others,
let this prime be referred to as n. We now proceed to show the two assumptions made above
will lead to non-sense, and so there are infinitely many primes.
Take the product of all prime numbers to yield a number x. Thus:
Then, let y equal one more than x:
One may now conclude that y is not divisible by any of the primes up to n, since y differs from
a multiple of each such prime by exactly 1. Since y is not divisible by any prime number, y
must either be prime, or its prime factors must all be greater than n, a contradiction of the
original assumption that n is the largest prime! Therefore, one must declare the original
assumption incorrect, and that there exists an infinite number of primes.
Fun Fact -- Largest known prime
The largest prime known to human is 230402457-1. It has a whopping 9152052 digits! Primes
of the form 2n-1 are called Mersenne primes named after the French monk/amateur
mathematician.
Primes in arithmetic progression
Consider the arithmetic progression
a, a + b, a + 2b, a + 3b ....
if a and b share a common factor greater than 1, then a + kb for any k is not prime. But if a and
b are coprimes, then there are infinitely many k's such that a + kb is prime! For example,
consider a = 3, b = 4,
3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31...
in this rather short list, 3, 7, 11, 19, 23 and 31 are prime and they are all equal to 4k + 3 for
some k. And there are infinitely many primes in this progression (see: proof by contradiction
exercise Mathematical Proofs).

Modular Arithmetic
Introduction
Modular arithmetic connects with primes in an interesting way. Firstly recall clock-arithmetic.
It is a system by which all numbers up to some positive integer, n say, are used. So if you were
to start counting you would go 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , n - 1 but instead of counting n you would start
over at 0. And what would have been n + 1 would be 1 and what would have been n + 2 would
be 2. Once 2n had been reach the number is reset to 0 again, and so on. Very much like the
clocks we have which starts at 1 and continues to 12 then back to 1 again.
The sequence also continues into what would be the negitive numbers. What would have been -
1 is now n - 1. For example, let's start with modulo 7 arithmetic, it's just like ordinary
arithmetic except the only numbers we use are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If we see a number outside
of this range we add 7 to (or subtract 7 from) it, until it lies within that range.
As mentioned above, modular arithmetic is not much different to ordinary arithmetic. For
example, consider modulo 7 arithmetic
The same deal for multiplication
We have done some calculation with negative numbers. Consider 5 × -6. Since -6 does not lie
in the range 0 to 6, we need to add 7 to it until it does. And -6 + 7 = 1. So in modular 7
arithmetic, -6 = 1. In the above example we showed that 5 × -6 = -30 = 5, but 5 × 1 = 5. So we
didn't do ourselves any harm by using -6 instead of 1. Why?
Note - Negatives: The preferred representation of -3 is 4, as -3 + 7 = 4, but using either -3 and
4 in a calculation will give us the same answer as long as we convert the final answer to a
number between 0 and 6 (inclusive).

i.e. find all numbers x such that x2 = 9 (mod 11). There are two solutions, find both.
Inverses
Let's consider a number n, the inverse of n is the number that when multiplied by n will give 1.
Let's consider a simple example, we want to solve the following equation in modulo 7,
the (mod 7) is used to make clear that we doing arithemetic modulo 7. We want to get rid of the
5 somehow, notice that
because 3 multiplied by 5 gives 1, so we say 3 is the inverse of 5 in modulo 7. Now we
multiply both sides by 3
So x = 2 modulo 7 is the required solution.
Inverse is unique

14
From above, we know the inverse of 5 is 3, but does 5 have another inverse? The answer is no.
In fact, in any reasonable number system, a number can have one and only one inverse. We can
see that from the following proof
Suppose n has two inverses b and c
From the above argument, all inverses of n must be equal. As a result, if the number n has
an inverse, the inverse must be unique.
From now on, we will use x-1 to denote the inverse of x if it exists.
An interesting property of any modulo n arithmetic is that the number n - 1 has itself as an
inverse. That is, (n - 1) × (n - 1) = 1 (mod n), or we can write (n - 1)2 = (-1)2 = 1 (mod n). The
proof is left as an exercise at the end of the section.
Existence of inverse
Not every number has an inverse in every modulo arithmetic. For example, 3 doesn't have an
inverse mod 6, i.e., we can't find a number x such that 3x = 1 mod 6 (the reader can easily
check).
Let's consider modulo 15 arithmetic and note that 15 is composite. We know the inverse of 1 is
1 and of 14 is 14. But what about 3, 6, 9, 12, 5 and 10? None of them has an inverse! Note that
each of them shares a common factor with 15!
Let's look at 3, we want to use a proof by contradiction argument to show that 3 does not have
an inverse modulo 15. Suppose 3 has an inverse, which is denoted by x.
We make the jump from modular arithemetic into rational number arithmetic. If 3x = 1 in
modulo 15 arithmetic, then
for some integer k. Now we divide both sides by 3, we get
But this is can't be true, because we know that x is an integer, not a fraction. Therefore 3 doesn't
have an inverse in mod 15 arithmetic. To show that 10 doesn't have an inverse is harder and is
left as an exercise.
We will now state the theorem regarding the existence of inverses in modular arithmetic.
Theorem

15
If n is prime then every number (except 0) has an inverse in modulo n arithmetic.
Similarly
If n is composite then every number that doesn't share a common factor with n has an inverse.
It is interesting to note that division is closely related to the concept of inverses. Consider the
following expresion
the conventional way to calculate the above would be to find the inverse of 3 (being 5). So
Let's write the inverse of 3 as 1/3, so we think of multiplying 3-1 as dividing by 3, we get
Notice that we got the same answer! In fact, the division method will always work if the
inverse exists.
Be very careful though, the expression in a different modulo system will produce the wrong
answer, for example
we don't get 2, as 3-1 does not exist in modulo 9, so we can't use the division method.

5. Find all inverses mod n (n ≤ 19)

Coprime and greatest common divisor
Two numbers are said to be coprimes if their greatest common divisor is 1. The greatest
common divisor (gcd) is just what its name says it is. And there is a quick and elegant way to
compute the gcd of two numbers, called Euclid's algorithm. Let's illustrate with a few
examples:

17
Example 1:
Find the gcd of 21 and 49.
We set up a 2-column table where the bigger of the two numbers is on the right hand side as
follows
smaller
larger
21
49
We now compute 49(mod 21) which is 7 and put it in the second row smaller column, and put
21 into the larger column.
smaller
larger
21
49
7
21
Perform the same action on the second row to produce the third row.
smaller
larger
21
49
7
21
0
7
Whenever we see the number 0 appear on the smaller column, we know the corresponding
larger number is the the gcd of the two numbers we started with, i.e. 7 is the gcd of 21 and 49.
This algorithm is called Euclid's algorithm.

info -- Algorithm
An algorithm is a step-by-step description of a series of actions when performed correctly
can accomplish a task. There are algorithms for finding primes, deciding whether 2
numbers 
are 
coprimes, 
finding 
inverses 
and 
many 
other 
purposes.
You'll learn how to implement some of the algorithms we have seen using a computer in the
chapter Mathematical Programming.

19
Finding Inverses
Let's look at the idea of inverse again, but from a different angle. In fact we will provide a sure-
fire method to find the inverse of any number. Let's consider:
5x = 1 (mod 7)
We know x is the inverse of 5 and we can work out it's 3 pretty quickly. But x = 10 is also a
solution, so is x = 17, 24, 31, ... 7n + 3. So there are infinitely many solutions; therefore we say
3 is equivalent to 10, 17, 24, 31 and so on. This is a crucial observation
Now let's consider
A new notation is introduced here, it is the equal sign with three strokes instead of two. It is the
"equivalent" sign; the above statement should read "216x is EQUIVALENT to 1" instead of
"216x is EQUAL to 1". From now on, we will use the equivalent sign for modulo arithmetic
and the equal sign for ordinary arithmetic.
Back to the example, we know that x exists, as gcd(811,216) = 1. The problem with the above
question is that there is no quick way to decide the value of x! The best way we know is to
multiply 216 by 1, 2, 3, 4... until we get the answer, there are at most 816 calculations, way too
tedious for humans. But there is a better way, and we have touched on it quite a few times!
We notice that we could make the jump just like before into rational mathematics:
We jump into rational maths again
We jump once more
Now the pattern is clear, we shall start from the beginning so that the process is not broken:

20
Now all we have to do is choose a value for f and substitute it back to find a! Remember a is
the inverse of 216 mod 811. We choose f = 0, therefore e = 1, d = 13, c = 40, b = 53 and finally
a = 199! If choose f to be 1 we will get a different value for a.
The very perceptive reader should have noticed that this is just Euclid's gcd algorithm in
reverse.
Here are a few more examples of this ingenious method in action:
Example 1
Find the smallest positive value of a:
Choose d = 0, therefore a = 49.
Example 2 Find the smallest positive value of a:
Choose e = 0, therefore a = -152 = 669
Example 3 Find the smallest positive value of a:

21
Set i = 0, then a = -21 = 34. Why is this so slow for two numbers that are so small? What can
you say about the coefficients?

22
Example 4 Find the smallest positive value of a:
Now d is not an integer, therefore 21 does not have an inverse mod 102.
What we have discussed so far is the method of finding integer solutions to equations of the
form:
ax + by = 1
where x and y are the unknowns and a and b are two given constants, these equations are called
linear Diophantine equations. It is interesting to note that sometimes there is no solution, but if
a solution exists, it implies that infinitely many solutions exist.
Diophantine equation
In the Modular Arithmetic section, we stated a theorem that says if gcd(a,m) = 1 then a-1 (the
inverse of a) exists in mod m. It is not difficult to see that if p is prime then gcd(b,p) = 1 for all
b less than p, therefore we can say that in mod p, every number except 0 has an inverse.
We also showed a way to find the inverse of any element mod p. In fact, finding the inverse of
a number in modular arithmetic amounts to solving a type of equations called Diophantine
equations. A Diophantine equation is an equation of the form
ax + by = d
where x and y are unknown.
As an example, we should try to find the inverse of 216 in mod 811. Let the inverse of 216 be
x, we can write
we can rewrite the above in every day arithmetic
which is in the form of a Diophantine equation.
Now we are going to do the inelegant method of solving the above problem, and then the
elegant method (using Magic Tables).

23
Both methods mentioned above uses the Euclid's algorithm for finding the gcd of two numbers.
In fact, the gcd is closely related to the idea of an inverse. Let's apply the Euclid's algorithm on
the two numbers 216 and 811. This time, however, we should store more details; more
specifically, we want to set up an additional column called PQ which stands for partial
quotient. The partial quotient is just a technical term for "how many n goes into m" e.g. The
partial quotient of 3 and 19 is 6, the partial quotient of 4 and 21 is 5 and one last example the
partial quotient of 7 and 49 is 7.

The tables says three 216s goes into 811 with remainder 163, or symbollically:
811 = 3×216 + 163.
Let's continue:

Reading off the table, we can form the following expressions
811 = 3× 216 + 163
216 = 1× 163 + 53
163 = 3× 53 + 4
53 =13× 4 + 1
Now that we can work out the inverse of 216 by working the results backwards
1 = 53 - 13×4
1 = 53 - 13×(163 - 3×53)

24
1 = 40×53 - 13×163
1 = 40×(216 - 163) - 13×163
1 = 40×216 - 53×163
1 = 40×216 - 53×(811 - 3×216)
1 = 199×216 - 53×811
Now look at the equation mod 811, we will see the inverse of 216 is 199.

The Magic Table is a more elegant way to do the above calculations, let us use the table we
form from Euclid's algorithm

Now we set up the so-called "magic table" which looks like this initially

Now we write the partial quotient on the first row:

We produce the table according to the following rule:
Multiply a partial quotient one space to the left of it in a different row, add the product to the
number two space to the left on the same row and put the sum in the corresponding row.
It sounds more complicated then it should. Let's illustrate by producing a column:
3
1
3
1

4
0

3

We put a 3 in the second row because 3 = 3×1 + 0. We put a 1 in the third row because 1 = 3×0
+ 1.
We shall now produce the whole table without disruption:

I claim
|199×216 - 811×53| = 1
In fact, if you have done the magic table properly and cross multiplied and subtracted the last

26
two column correctly, then you will always get 1 or -1, provided the two numbers you started
with are coprimes. The magic table is just a cleaner way of doing the mathematics.

Chinese remainder theorem
The Chinese remainder theorem is known in China as Han Xing Dian Bing, which in its most
naive translation means Han Xing counts his soldiers. The original problem goes like this:
There exists a number x, when divided by 3 leaves remainder 2, when divided by 5 leaves
remainder 3 and when divided by 7 leaves remaider 2. Find the smallest x.
We translate the question into symbolic form:

28
How do we go about finding such a x? We shall use a familar method and it is best illustrated
by example:
Looking at x = 2 (mod 3), we make the jump into ordinary mathematics
Now we look at the equation modulo 5
Substitute into (1) to get the following
Now look at the above modulo 7
we get
We choose b = 1 to minimise x, therefore x = 23. And a simple check (to be performed by the
reader) should confirm that x = 23 is a solution. A good question to ask is what is the next
smallest x that satisfies the three congruences? The answer is x = 128, and the next is 233 and
the next is 338, and they differ by 105, the product of 3, 5 and 7.
We will illustrate the method of solving a system of congruencies further by the following
examples:
Example 1 Find the smallest x that satifies:

29
Solution
now substitute back into the first equation, we get
we obtain
again substituting back
Therefore 52 is the smallest x that satifies the congruencies.
Example 2
Find the smallest x that satisfies:
Solution

30
substituting back
now solve for b
again, substitue back
Therefore 269 is the smallest x that satifies the Congruences.
Excercises

2. Solve for x
*Existence of a solution*
The exercises above all have a solution. So does there exist a system of congruences such that
no solution could be found? It certainly is possible, consider:
x ≡ 5 (mod 15)
x ≡ 10 (mod 21)

31
a cheekier example is:
x ≡ 1 (mod 2)
x ≡ 0 (mod 2)
but we won't consider silly examples like that.
Back to the first example, we can try to solve it by doing:
the above equation has no solution because 3 does not have an inverse modulo 21!
One may be quick to conclude that if two modulo systems share a common factor then there is
no solution. But this is not true! Consider:
we can find a solution
we now multiply both sides by the inverse of 5 (which is 17), we obtain
obviously, k = 3 is a solution, and the two modulo systems are the same as the first example
(i.e. 15 and 21).
So what determines whether a system of congruences has a solution or not? Let's consider the
general case:
we have

32
essentially, the problem asks us to find k and l such that the above equations are satisfied.
We can approach the problem as follows
now suppose m and n have gcd(m,n) = d, and m = dmo, n = dno. We have
if (a - b)/d is an integer then we can read the equation mod mo, we have:
Again, the above only makes sense if (a - b)/d is integeral. Also if (a - b)/d is an integer, then
there is a solution, as mo and no are coprimes!
In summary: for a system of two congruent equations
there is a solution if and only if
d = gcd(m,n) divides (a - b)
And the above generalises well into more than 2 congruences. For a system of n congruences:
...
for a solution to exist, we require that if i ≠ j
gcd(mi,mj) divides (ai - aj)

33

This chapter has been a gentle introduction to number theory, a profoundly beautiful branch of
mathematics. It is gentle in the sense that it is mathematically light and overall quite easy. If
you enjoyed the material in this chapter, you would also enjoy Further Modular Arithmetic,
which is a harder and more rigorous treatment of the subject.
Also, if you feel like a challenge you may like to try out the Probelem Set we have prepared for
you. On the other hand, the project asks you to take a more investigative approach to work
through some of the finer implications of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Prime Sieve Exercises
1. 
Use the above result to quickly work out the numbers that still need to be crossed out in
the table below, knowing 5 is the next prime:
The next prime number is 5. Because 5 is an unmarked prime number, and 5 * 5 = 25, cross out
25. Also, 7 is an unmarked prime number, and 5 * 7 = 35, so cross off 35. However, 5 * 11 =
55, which is too high, so mark 5 as prime ad move on to 7. The only number low enough to be
marked off is 7 * 7, which equals 35. You can go no higher.

If you know 29 mod 11 = 6.
You can find 210 mod 11 = (2*(29 mod 11)) mod 11 = 2*6 mod 11 = 12 mod 11 = 1.
We can note that 29 = 6 and 210 = 1, we can calculate 62 easily: 62 = 218 = 2^8 = 3. OR by the

Question 1
Show that the divisible-by-3 theorem works for any 3 digits numbers (Hint: Express a 3 digit
number as 100a + 10b + c, where a, b and c are ≥  0 and < 10)
Solution 1 Any 3 digits integer x can be expressed as follows
x = 100a + 10b + c
where a, b and c are positive integer between 0 and 9 inclusive. Now
if and only if a + b + c = 3k for some k. But a, b and c are the digits of x.
Question 2
"A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9." True or false?
Determine whether 89, 558, 51858, and 41857 are divisible by 9. Check your answers.
Solution 2 The statement is true and can be proven as in question 1.

49
Question 4
The prime sieve has been applied to the table of numbers above. Notice that every number
situated directly below 2 and 5 are crossed out. Construct a rectangular grid of numbers running
from 1 to 60 so that after the prime sieve has been performed on it, all numbers situated directly
below 3 and 5 are crossed out. What is the width of the grid?
Solution 4 The width of the grid should be 15 or a multiple of it.
Question 6
Show that n - 1 has itself as an inverse modulo n.
Solution 6
(n - 1)2 = n2 - 2n + 1 = 1 (mod n)
Alternatively
(n - 1)2 = (-1)2 = 1 (mod n)
Question 7
Show that 10 does not have an inverse modulo 15.
Solution 7 Suppose 10 does have an inverse x mod 15,
10x = 1 (mod 15)
2Ã-5x = 1 (mod 15)
5x = 8 (mod 15)
5x = 8 + 15k
for some integer k
x = 1.6 + 3k
but now x is not an integer, therefore 10 does not have an inverse

minus the second is divisible by 11.
Question 2
Show that p, p + 2 and p + 4 cannot all be primes. (p a positive integer)
Solution
We look at the arithmetic mod 3, then p slotted into one of three categories
1st category
we deduce p is not prime, as it's a multiple of 3
2nd category
so p + 2 is not prime
3rd category
therefore p + 4 is not prime

51
Therefore p, p + 2 and p + 4 cannot all be primes.

Solution
Look at the equation mod 5, we have

therefore there does not exist a x such that
Question 5
Let p be a prime number. Show that
(a)
where
E.g. 3! = 1Ã-2Ã-3 = 6
(b) Hence, show that
for p ≡1 (mod 4)
Solution
a) If p = 2, then it's obvious. So we suppose p is an odd prime. Since p is prime, some deep
thought will reveal that every distinct element multiplied by some other element will give 1.
Since
we can pair up the inverses (two numbers that multiply to give one), and (p - 1) has itself as an
inverse, therefore it's the only element not "eliminated"

53
as required.
b) From part a)
since p = 4k + 1 for some positive integer k, (p - 1)! has 4k terms
there are an even number of minuses on the right hand side, so
it follows
and finally we note that p = 4k + 1, we can conclude

Logic
Introduction
Logic is the study of the way we humans reason. In this chapter, we focus on the methods of
logical reasoning, i.e. digital logic, predicate calculus, application to proofs and the (insanely)
fun logical puzzles.
Boolean algebra
In the black and white world of ideals, there is absolute truth. That is to say everything is either
true or false. With this philosophical backdrop, we consider the following examples:
"One plus one equals two." True or false?
That is (without a doubt) true!
"1 + 1 = 2 AND 2 + 2 = 4." True or false?
That is also true.
But what about:
"1 + 1 = 3 OR Sydney is in Australia" True or false?
It is true! Although 1 + 1 = 3 is not true, the OR in the statement made it so that if either part of
the statement is true then the whole statement is true.
Now let's consider a more puzzling example
"2 + 2 = 4 OR 1 + 1 = 3 AND 1 - 3 = -1" True or false?
The truth or falsity of the statements depends on the order in which you evaluate the statement.
If you evaluate "2 + 2 = 4 OR 1 + 1 = 3" first, the statement is false, and otherwise true. As in
ordinary algebra, it is necessary that we define some rules to govern the order of evaluation, so
we don't have to deal with ambiguity.
Before we decide which order to evaluate the statements in, we do what most mathematician
love 
to 
do 
-- 
replace 
sentences 
with 
symbols.
Let 
x 
represent 
the 
truth 
or 
falsity 
of 
the 
statement 
2 
+ 
2 
= 
4.
Let 
y 
represent 
the 
truth 
or 
falsity 
of 
the 
statement 
1 
+ 
1 
= 
3.
Let z represent the truth or falsity of the statement 1 - 3 = -1.
Then the above example can be rewritten in a more compact way:

55
x OR y AND z
To go one step further, mathematicians also replace OR by + and AND by Ã-, the statement
becomes:
Now that the order of precedence is clear. We evaluate (y AND z) first and then OR it with x.
The statement "x + yz" is true, or symbolically
x + yz = 1
where the number 1 represents "true".
There is a good reason why we choose the multiplicative sign for the AND operation. As we
shall see later, we can draw some parallels between the AND operation and multiplication.
The Boolean algebra we are about to investigate is named after the British mathematician
George Boole. Boolean algebra is about two things -- "true" or "false" which are often
represented by the numbers 1 and 0 respectively. Alternative, T and F are also used.
Boolean algebra has operations (AND and OR) analogous to the ordinary algebra that we know
and love.
Basic Truth tables
We have all had to memorise the 9 by 9 multiplication table and now we know it off by heart.
In Boolean algebra, the idea of a truth table is somewhat similar.
Let's consider the AND operation which is analogous to the multiplication. We want to
consider:
x AND y
where and x and y each represent a true or false statement (e.g. It is raining today). It is true if
and only if both x and y are true, in table form:
The AND function
x
y
x AND y
F
F
F
F
T
F
T
F
F
T
T

56
We shall use 1 instead of T and 0 instead of F from now on.
The AND function
x
y
x AND y
0
0
0
0
1
0
1
0
0
1
1

Now you should be able to see why we say AND is analogous to multiplication, we shall
replace the AND by Ã-, so x AND y becomes xÃ-y (or just xy). From the AND truth table, we
have:
0 Ã- 0 = 0
0 Ã- 1 = 0
1 Ã- 0 = 0
1 Ã- 1 = 1
To the OR operation. x OR y is FALSE if and only if both x and y are false. In table form:
The OR function
x
y
x OR y
0
0
0
0
1
1
1
0

We say OR is almost analoguous to addition. We shall illustrate this by replacing OR with +:
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 1 (like 1 OR 1 is 1)

57
The NOT operation is not a binary operation, like AND and OR, but a unary operation,
meaning it works with one argument. NOT x is true if x is false and false if x is true. In table
form:
The NOT function
x
NOT x
0

0
In symbolic form, NOT x is denoted x' or ~x (or by a bar over the top of x).
Alternative notations:
and
Compound truth tables
The three truth tables presented above are the most basic of truth tables and they serve as the
building blocks for more complex ones. Suppose we want to construct a truth table for xy + z
(i.e. x AND y OR z). Notice this table involves three variables (x, y and z), so we would expect
it to be bigger then the previous ones.
To construct a truth table, firstly we write down all the possible combinations of the three
variables:
x
y
z
0
0
0
0
0
1
0
1
0
0
1
1
1
0
0
1
0
1
1
1
0

58
1

1
There is a pattern to the way the combinations are written down. We always start with 000 and
end with 111. As to the middle part, it is up to the reader to figure out.
We then complete the table by hand computing what value each combination is going to
produce using the expression xy + z. For example:
000
x = 0, y = 0 and z = 0
xy + z = 0
001
x = 0, y = 0 and z = 1
xy + z = 1
We continue in this way until we fill up the whole table
The procedure we follow to produce truth tables are now clear. Here are a few more examples
of truth tables.
Example 1 -- x + y + z

59
Example 2 -- (x + yz)'
When an expression is hard to compute, we can first compute intermediate results and then the
final result.
Example 3 -- (x + yz')w

60
Exercise
Produce the truth tables for the following operations:
8. 
NAND: x NAND y = NOT (x AND y)
9. 
NOR: x NOR y = NOT (x OR y)
10. 
XOR: x XOR y is true if and ONLY if one of x or y is true.
Produce truth tables for:
4.

x'y'z'
6.

7. 
xz
8. 
(x + y)'

61
9.

10. 
(xy)'
11. 
x' + y'
Laws of Boolean algebra
In ordinary algebra, two expressions may be equivalent to each other, e.g. xz + yz = (x + y)z.
The same can be said of Boolean algebra. Let's construct truth tables for:
xz + yz
(x + y)z
xz + yz
(x + y)z

62
By comparing the two tables, you will have noticed that the outputs (i.e. the last column) of the
two tables are the same!
Definition
We say two Boolean expressions are equivalent if the output of their truth tables are the same.
We list a few expressions that are equivalent to each other
x + 0 = x
x Ã- 1 = x
xz + yz = (x + y)z
x + x' = 1
x Ã- x' = 0
x Ã- x = x
x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)
Take a few moments to think about why each of those laws might be true.
The last law is not obvious but we can prove that it's true using the other laws:
As Dr Kuo Tzee-Char, Honorary reader of mathematics at the University of Sydney, is so fond
of saying: "The only thing to remember in mathematics is that there is nothing to remember.
Remember that!". You should not try to commit to memory the laws as they are stated, because
some of them are so deadly obvious once you are familiar with the AND, OR and NOT
operations. You should only try to remember those things that are most basic, once a high level
of familiarity is developed, you will agree there really isn't anything to remember.
Simplification
Once we have those laws, we will want to simplify Boolean expressiosn just like we do in
ordinary algebra. We can all simplify the following example with ease:

63
the same can be said about:
From those two examples we can see that complex-looking expressions can be reduced very
significantly. Of particular interest are expressions of the form of a sum-of-product, for
example:
xyz + xyz' + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'z' + x'y'z
We can factorise and simplify the expression as follows
xyz + xyz' + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'z' + x'y'z
It is only hard to go any further, although we can. We use the identity:
x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)
If the next step is unclear, try constructing truth tables as an aid to understanding.
And this is as far as we can go using the algebraic approach (or any other approach). The
algebraic approach to simplication relies on the priniciple of elimination. Consider, in ordinary
algebra:
x + y - x
We simplify by rearranging the expression as follows
(x - x) + y = y

64
Although we only go through the process in our head, the idea is clear: we bring together terms
that cancel themselves out and so the expression is simplified.

65
De Morgan's theorems
So far we have only dealt with expressions in the form of a sum of products e.g. xyz + x'z +
y'z'. De Morgan's theorems help us to deal with another type of Boolean expressions. We revisit
the AND and OR truth tables:
x
y
x Ã- y
x + y
0
0
0
0
0
1
0
1
1
0
0
1
1
1
1
1
You would be correct to suspect that the two operations are connected somehow due to the
similarities between the two tables. In fact, if you invert the AND operation, i.e. you perform
the NOT operations on x AND y. The outputs of the two operations are almost the same:
x
y
(x Ã- y)'
x + y
0
0
1
0
0
1
1
1
1
0
1
1
1
1
0
1

66

67
The connection between AND, OR and NOT is revealed by reversing the output of x + y by
replacing it with x' + y'.
x
y
(x Ã- y)'
x' + y'
0
0
1
1
0
1
1
1
1
0
1
1
1
1
0
0
Now the two outputs match and so we can equate them:
(xy)' = x' + y'
this is one of de Morgan's laws. The other which can be derived using a similar process is:
(x + y)' = x'y'
We can apply those two laws to simplify equations:
Example 
1
Express x in sum of product form
Example 
2
Express x in sum of product form
This points to a possible extension of De Morgan's laws to 3 or more

68
variables.
Example 
3
Express x in sum of product form
Example 
4
Express x in sum of product form
Another thing of interest we learnt is that we can reverse the truth table of any expression by
replacing each of its variables by their opposites, i.e. replace x by x' and y' by y etc. This result
shouldn't have been a suprise at all, try a few examples yourself.
De Morgan's laws
(x + y)' = x'y'
(xy)' = x' + y'

Express in simplified sum-of-product form:
1. 
z = ab'c' + ab'c + abc
2. 
z = ab(c + d)
3. 
z = (a + b)(c + d + f)
4. 
z = a'c(a'bd)' + a'bc'd' + ab'c
5. 
z = (a' + b)(a + b + d)d'
4. 
Show that x + yz is equivalent to (x + y)(x + z)

69
Propositions
We have been dealing with propositions since the start of this chapter, although we are not told
they are propositions. A proposition is simply a statement (or sentence) that is either TRUE or
FALSE. Hence, we can use Boolean algebra to handle propositions.
There are two special types of propositions -- tautology and contradiction. A tautology is a
proposition that is always TRUE, e.g. "1 + 1 = 2". A contradiction is the opposite of a
tautology, it is a proposition that is always FALSE, e.g. 1 + 1 = 3. As usual, we use 1 to
represent TRUE and 0 to represent FALSE. Please note that opinions are not propositions, e.g.
"George W. Bush started the war on Iraq for its oil." is just an opinion, its truth or falsity is not
universal, meaning some think it's true, some do not.
Examples
• "It is raining today" is a proposition.
• "Sydney is in Australia" is a proposition.
• "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 16" is a proposition.
• "Earth is a perfect sphere" is a proposition.
• "How do you do?" is not a proposition - it's a question.
• "Go clean your room!" is not a proposition - it's a command.
• "Martians exist" is a proposition.
Since each proposition can only take two values (TRUE or FALSE), we can represent each by
a variable and decide whether compound propositions are true by using Boolean algebra, just
like we have been doing. For example "It is always hot in Antarctica OR 1 + 1 = 2" will be
evaluated as true.
Implications
Propositions of the type if something something then something something are called
implications. The logic of implications are widely applicable in mathematics, computer science
and general everyday common sense reasoning! Let's start with a simple example
"If 1 + 1 = 2 then 2 - 1 = 1"
is an example of implication, it simply says that 2 - 1 = 1 is a consequence of 1 + 1 = 2. It's like
a cause and effect relationship. Consider this example:
John says: "If I become a millionaire, then I will donate $500,000 to the Red Cross."

70
There are four situations:
5. 
John becomes a millionaire and donates $500,000 to the Red Cross
6. 
John becomes a millionaire and does not donate $500,000 to the Red Cross
7. 
John does not become a millionaire and donates $500,000 to the Red Cross
8. 
John does not become a millionaire and does not donate $500,000 to the Red Cross
In which of the four situations did John NOT fulfill his promise? Clearly, if and only if the second
situation occured. So, we say the proposition is FALSE if and only if John becomes a
millionaire and does not donate. If John did not become a millionaire then he can't break his
promise, because his promise is now claiming nothing, therefore it must be evaluated TRUE.
If x and y are two propositions, x implies y (if x then y), or symbolically
has the following truth table:
x
y
0
0
1
0
1
1
1
0
0
1
1
1
For emphasis, 
is FALSE if and only if x is true and y false. If x is FALSE, it does not
matter what value y takes, the proposition is automatically TRUE. On a side note, the two
propositions x and y need not have anything to do with each other, e.g. "1 + 1 = 2 implies
Australia is in the southern hemisphere" evaluates to TRUE!
If
then we express it symbolically as
.

71
It is a two way implication which translates to x is TRUE if and only if y is true. The if and only
if operation has the following truth table:
x
y
0
0
1
0
1
0
1
0
0
1
1
1
The two new operations we have introduced are not really new, they are just combinations of
AND, OR and NOT. For example:
Check it with a truth table. Because we can express the implication operations in terms of
AND, OR and NOT, we have open them to manipulation by Boolean algebra and de Morgan's
laws.
Example 
1
Is the following proposition a tautology (a proposition that's always true)
Solution 1
Therefore it's a tautology.
Solution 
2
A somewhat easier solution is to draw up a truth table of the proposition, and note that the
output column are all 1s. Therefore the proposition is a tautology, because the output is 1
regardless of the inputs (i.e. x, y and z).

72
Example 
2
Show that the proposition z is a contradiction (a proposition that is always false):
z = xy(x + y)'
Solution
Therefore it's a contradiction.
Back to Example 1, :
. This isn't just a slab of symbols,
you should be able translate it into everyday language and understand intuitively why it's true.

Logic Puzzles
Puzzle is an all-encompassing word, it refers to anything trivial that requires solving. Here is a
collection of logic puzzles that we can solve using Boolean algebra.
Example 1
We have two type of people -- knights or knaves. A knight always tell the truth but the knaves
always lie.
Two people, Alex and Barbara, are chatting. Alex says :"We are both knaves"
Who is who?
We can probably work out that Alex is a knave in our heads, but the algebraic approach to
determine Alex 's identity is as follows:
Let A be TRUE if Alex is a knight

73
Let B be TRUE if Barbara is a knight
There are two situations, either:
Alex is a knight and what he says is TRUE, OR
he is NOT a knight and what he says it FALSE.
There we have it, we only need to translate it into symbols:
A(A'B') + A'[(A'B')'] = 1
we simplify:
(AA')B' + A'[A + B] = 1
A'A + A'B = 1
A'B = 1
Therefore A is FALSE and B is TRUE. Therefore Alex is a knave and Barbara a knight.
Example 2
There are three businessmen, conveniently named Abner, Bill and Charley, who order martinis
together every weekend according to the following rules:
4. 
If A orders a martini, so does B.
5. 
Either B or C always order a martini, but never at the same lunch.
6. 
Either A or C always order a martini (or both)
7. 
If C orders a martini, so does A.
2. 
or AB + A'B' = 1
3. 
B'C + BC' = 1
4. 
A + C = 1

Mathematical proofs
"It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover."
Introduction
Mathematicians have been, for the past five hundred years or so, obsessed with proofs. They
want to prove everything, and in the process proved that they can't prove everything (see this).
This chapter will introduce the techniques of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction
and the axiomatic approach to mathematics.
Mathematical induction
Deductive reasoning is the process of reaching a conclusion that is guaranteed to follow. For
example, if we know
• All ravens are black birds, and
• For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
then we can conclude:
• This bird is a raven, therefore it is black.
• This billiard ball will move when struck with a cue.
Induction is the opposite of deduction. To induce, we observe how things behave in specific
cases and from that we draw conclusions as to how things behave in the general case. For
example:
We know it is true for all numbers, because Gauss told us. But how do we show that it's true for
all positive integers? Even if we can show the identity holds for numbers from one to a trillion
or any larger number we can think of, we still haven't proved that it's true for all positive
integers. This is where mathematical induction comes in, it works somewhat like the dominoes.
If we can show that the identity holds for some number k, and that mere fact implies that the
identity also holds for k + 1, then we have effectively shown that it works for all integers.
Example 1 Show that the identity

77
holds for all positive integers.
Solution Firstly, we show that it holds for integers 1, 2 and 3
1 = 2Ã-1/2
1 + 2 = 3Ã-2/2
1 + 2 + 3 = 4Ã-3/2 = 6
Suppose the identity holds for some number k:
This supposition is known as the induction hypothesis. We assume it is true, and aim to show
that,
is also true.
We proceed
which is what we have set out to show. Since the identity holds for 3, it also holds for 4, and
since it holds for 4 it also holds for 5, and 6, and 7, and so on.
There are two types of mathematical induction: strong and weak. In weak induction, you
assume the identity holds for certain value k, and prove it for k+1. In strong induction, the
identity must be true for any value lesser or equal to k, and then prove it for k+1.

78
Example 2 Show that n! > 2n for n ≥  4.
Solution The claim is true for n = 4. As 4! > 24, i.e. 24 > 16. Now suppose it's true for n = k, k
≥ 4, i.e.
k! > 2k
it follows that
(k+1)k! > (k+1)2k > 2k+1
(k+1)! > 2k+1
We have shown that if for n = k then it's also true for n = k + 1. Since it's true for n = 4, it's true
for n = 5, 6, 7, 8 and so on for all n.
Example 3 Show that
Solution Suppose it's true for n = k, i.e.
it follows that
We have shown that if it's true for n = k then it's also true for n = k + 1. Now it's true for n = 1
(clear). Therefore it's true for all integers.
Exercises
1. Prove that 
2. Prove that for n ≥ 1,

79
where xn and yn are integers.
3. Note that
Prove that there exists an explicit formula for
for all integer m. E.g.
4. The sum of all of the interior angles of a triangle is 
; the sum of all the angles of a
rectangle is 
. Prove that the sum of all the angles of a polygon with n sides, is
.
Proof by contradiction
"When you have eliminated the impossible, what ever remains, however improbable must be
the truth." Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
The idea of a proof by contradiction is to:
6. 
First, we assume that the opposite of what we wish to prove is true.
7. 
Then, we show that the logical consequences of the assumption include a contradiction.
8. 
Finally, we conclude that the assumption must have been false.
Root 2 is irrational
As an example, we shall prove that 
is not a rational number. Recall that a rational number
is a number which can be expressed in the form of p/q, where p and q are integers and q does
not equal 0 (see the 'categorizing numbers' section here).
First, assume that 
is rational:
where a and b are coprimes (i.e. both integers with no common factors). If a and b are not
coprimes, we remove all common factors. In other words, a/b is in simplest form. Now,

80
continuing:
We have now found that a2 is some integer multiplied by 2. Therefore, a2 must be divisible by
two. If a2 is even, then a must also be even, for an odd number squared yields an odd number.
Therefore we can write a = 2c, where c is another integer.
We have discovered that b2 is also an integer multiplied by two. It follows that b must be even.
We have a contradiction! Both a and b are even integers. In other words, both have the
common factor of 2. But we already said that a/b is in simplest form. Since such a contradiction
has been established, we must conclude that our original assumption was false. Therefore, âˆš2
is irrational.
Contrapositive
Some propositions that take the form of if xxx then yyy can be hard to prove. It is sometimes
useful to consider the contrapositive of the statement. Before I explain what contrapositive is
let us see an example
"If x2 is odd then x is is also odd"
is harder to prove than
"if x even then x2 is also even"
although they mean the same thing. So instead of proving the first proposition directly, we
prove the second proposition instead.
If A and B are two propositions, and we aim to prove
If A is true then B is true
we may prove the equivalent statement
If B is false then A is false
instead. This technique is called proof by contrapositive.
To see why those two statements are equivalent, we show the following boolean algebra

81
expressions is true (see Logic)
(to be done by the reader).

p1p2...pm + 3)

This is some basic information to help with reading other higher mathematical literature. ... to

Quantifiers
Sometimes we need propositions that involve some description of rough quantity, e.g. "For all
odd integers x, x2 is also odd". The word all is a description of quantity. The word "some" is
also used to describe quantity.
Two special symbols are used to describe the quanties "all" and "some"
means "for all" or "for any"
means "there are some" or "there exists"
Example 
1
The proposition:
For all even integers x, x2 is also even.
can be expressed symbolically as:
Example 
2
The proposition:
There are some odd integers x, such that x2 is even.
can be expressed symbolically as:

82
This proposition is false.
Example 
3
Consider the proposition concerning (z = x'y' + xy):
For any value of x, there exist a value for y, such that z = 1.
can be expressed symbolically as:
This proposition is true. Note that the order of the quantifiers is important. While the above
statement is true, the statement
is false. It asserts that there is one value of y which is the same for all x for which z=1. The first
statement only asserts that there is a y for each x, but different values of x may have different
values of y.
Negation
Negation is just a fancy word for the opposite, e.g. The negation of "All named Britney can
sing" is "Some named Britney can't sing". What this says is that to disprove that all people
named Britney can sing, we only need to find one named Britney who can't sing. To express
symbolically:
Let p represent a person named Britney
Similarly, to disprove
we only need to find one odd number that doesn't satisfy the condition. Three is odd, but 3Ã-3
= 9 is also odd, therefore the proposition is FALSE and
is TRUE
In summary, to obtain the negation of a proposition involving a quantifier, you replace the
quantifier by its opposite (e.g. 
with 
) and the quantified proposition (e.g. "x is even") by
its negation (e.g. "x is odd").

Axioms and Inference
If today's mathematicians were to describe the greatest achievement in mathematics in the 20th
century in one word, that word will be abstraction. True to its name, abstraction is a very
abstract concept (see Abstraction).
In this chapter we shall discuss the essence of some of the number systems we are familiar
with. For example, the real numbers and the rational numbers. We look at the most
fundamental properties that, in some sense, define those number systems.
We begin our discussion by looking at some of the more obscure results we were told to be true
• 0 times any number gives you 0
• a negative number multiplied by a negative number gives you a positive number
Most people simply accept that they are true (and they are), but the two results above are
simple consequences of what we believe to be true in a number system like the real numbers!
To understand this we introduce the idea of axiomatic mathematics (mathematics with simple
assumptions). An axiom is a statement about a number system that we assume to be true. Each
number system has a few axioms, from these axioms we can draw conclusions (inferences).
Let's consider the Real numbers, it has axioms Let a, b and c be real numbers
For a, b, and c taken from the real numbers
A1: a+b is a real number also (closure)
A2: There exist 0, such that 0 + a = a for all a (existence of zero - an identity)
A3: For every a, there exist b (written -a), such that a + b = 0 (existence of an additive inverse)
A4: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) (associativity of addition)
A5: a + b = b + a (commutativity of addition)
For a, b, and c taken from the real numbers excluding zero
M1: ab (closure)
M2: There exist an element, 1, such that 1a = a for all a (existence of one - an identity)

84
M3: For every a there exists a b such that ab = 1
M4: (ab)c = a(bc) (associativity of multiplication)
M5: ab = ba (commutativity of multiplication)
D1: a(b + c) = ab + ac (distributivity)
These are the minimums we assume to be true in this system. These are minimum in the sense
that everything else that is true about this number system can be derived from those axioms!
Let's consider the following true identity
(x + y)z = xz + yz
which is not included in the axioms, but we can prove it using the axioms. We proceed:
Before we proceed any further, you will have notice that the real numbers are not the only
numbers that satifies those axioms! For example the rational numbers also satify all the axioms.
This leads to the abstract concept of a field. In simple terms, a field is a number system that
satisfies all those axiom. Let's define a field more carefully:
A number system, F, is a field if it supports + and Ã- operations such that:
For a, b, and c taken from F
A1: a + b is in F also (closure)
A2: There exist 0, such that 0 + a = a for all a (existence of zero - an identity)
A3: For every a, there exist b (written -a), such that a + b = 0 (existence of an additive
inverse)
A4: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) (associativity of addition)
A5: a + b = b + a (commutativity of addition)
For a, b, and c taken from F with the zero removed (sometimes written F*)
M1: ab is in F (closure)
M2: There exist an element, 1, such that 1a = a for all a (existence of one - the identity)
M3: For every a there exists a b such that ab = 1 (inverses)
M4: (ab)c = a(bc) (associativity of multiplication)

85
M5: ab = ba (commutativity of multiplication)
D1: a(b + c) = ab + ac (distributivity)
Now, for M3, we do not let b be zero, since 1/0 has no meaning. However for the M axioms,
we have excluded zero anyway.
For interested students, the requirements of closure, identity, having inverses and associativity
on an operation and a set are known as a group. If F is a group with addition and F* is a group
with multiplication, plus the distributivity requirement, F is a field. The above axioms merely
state this fact in full.
Note that the natural numbers are not a field, as M3 is general not satified, i.e. not every natural
number has an inverse that is also a natural number.
Please note also that (-a) denotes the additive inverse of a, it doesn't say that (-a) = (-1)(a),
although we can prove that they are equivalent.
Example 1
Prove using only the axioms that 0 = -0, where -0 is the additive inverse of 0.
Solution 1
0 = 0 + (-0) by A3: existence of inverse
0 = (-0) by A2: 0 + a = a
Example 2
Let F be a field and a an element of F. Prove using nothing more than the axioms that 0a = 0
for all a.
Solution
0 = 0a + (-0a) by A3 existence of inverse
0 = (0 + 0)a + (-0a) by Example 1
0 = (0a + 0a) + (-0a) by distributivity and commutativity of multiplication
0 = 0a + (0a + (-0a)) by associativity of addition
0 = 0a + 0 by A3
0 = 0a by A2.
Example 3
Prove that (-a) = (-1)a.

86
Solution 3
(-a) = (-a) + 0
(-a) = (-a) + 0a by Example 2
(-a) = (-a) + (1 + (-1))a
(-a) = (-a) + (1a + (-1)a)
(-a) = (-a) + (a + (-1)a)
(-a) = ((-a) + a) + (-1)a
(-a) = 0 + (-1)a
(-a) = (-1)a
One wonders why we need to prove such obvious things (obvious since primary school). But
the idea is not to prove that they are true, but to practise inferencing, how to logically join up
arguments to prove a point. That is a vital skill in mathematics.

Mathematical induction exercises
1.
Prove that 12 + 22 + ... + n2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
When n=1,
L.H.S. = 12 = 1
R.H.S. = 1*2*3/6 = 6/6 = 1
Therefore L.H.S. = R.H.S.
Therefore this is true when n=1.
Assume that this is true for some positive integer k,
i.e. 12 + 22 + ... + k2 = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6
Therefore this is also true for k+1.
Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, this holds for all positive integer n.
2. Prove that for n ≥  1,
where xn and yn are integers.

89
When n=1,
Therefore x1=1 and y1=1, which are both integers.
Therefore this is true when n=1.
Assume that this is true for some positive integer k,
i.e. 
where xk and yk are integers.
Because xk and yk are both integers, therefore xk + 5yk and xk + yk are integers also.
Therefore this is true for k+1 also.
Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, this holds for all positive integer n.
3. (The solution assume knowledge in binomial expansion and summation notation)
Note that
Prove that there exists an explicit formula for

It's clear that 11 + 21 + ... = (n+1)n/2. So the proposition is true for m=1.
Suppose that

has an explicit formula in terms of n for all j < k (**), we aim to prove that
also has an explicit formula.
Starting from the property given, i.e.
Since we know the formula for power sum of any power less then k (**), we can solve the
above equation and find out the formula for the k-th power directly.
Hence, by the principle of strong mathematical induction, this proposition is true.
Additional info for question 3
The method employed in question 3 to find out the general formula for power sum is called the
method of difference, as shown by that we consider the sum of all difference of adjacant terms.
Aside from the method above, which lead to a recursive solution for finding the general formula,
there're also other methods, such as that of using generating function. Refer to the last question in the

Infinity and infinite processes
Introduction
As soon as a child first learns about numbers, they become interested in big ones, a million, a
billion, a trillion. They even make up their own, a zillion etc. One of the first mathematical
questions a child asks is "what is the largest number?" This will often lead to a short
explanation that there are infinitely many numbers.
But there are many different types of infinity - in fact, there are infinite types of infinity! This
chapter will try to explain what some of these types mean and the differences between them.
Infinite Sets
How big is infinity?
Infinity is unlike a normal number because, by definition, it is not finite. Dividing infinity by
any positive number (except infinity) gives us infinity. You can also multiply it by anything
except zero (or infinity) and it will not get bigger. So let's look more carefully at the different
types of infinity.
There was once a mathematician called Georg Cantor who created a new branch of
mathematics called set theory in the late 19th century. Set theory involves collections of
numbers or objects. Here's a set:
{1,2,3,4,5}
Is it the same size as this one?
{6,7,8,9,10}
Cantor's notion of sets being "the same size" does not consider whether the numbers are bigger,
but whether there are the same amount of objects in it. You can easily see here that they are the
same size, because you can simply count the number of members in each set. But with an
infinite number of members you cannot, in a finite amount of time, count all the members of
one set to see if they are the same number of them as there are in another set.
In order to decide if two infinite sets have the same number of members we need to think
carefully about what we do when we count. Think of a small child sharing out sweets, between
her and her brother.
"One for you, and one for me, two for you and two for me"
and so on. She knows that they both get the same number of sweets because of the way the
sharing out was done. Even if she runs out of numbers (like if she can only count up to ten) she
can still distribute the candy with the even process of "another one for you and another one for

96
me".
We can use the same idea to compare infinite sets. If we can find a way to pair up one member
of set A with one member of set B, and if there are no members of A without a partner in B and
vice versa then we can say that set A and set B have the same number of members.
Example
Let Set N be all counting numbers. N is called the set of natural numbers. 1,2,3,4,5,6, ... and so
to infinity. Let Set B be the negative numbers -1,-2,-3, ... and so on to -infinity. Can the
members of N and B be paired up? The formal way of saying this is "Can A and B be put into a
one to one correspondance"?
Obviously the answer is yes. 1 in set N corresponds with -1 in B. Likewise:
N   B
1   -1
2   -2
3   -3
and so on.
So useful is the set of counting numbers that any set that can be put into a one to one
correspondence with it is said to be countably infinite.
Let's look at some more examples. Is the set of integers countably infinite? Integers are set N,
set B and 0.
... -3,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
Historically this set is usually called Z. Note that N the set of natural numbers is a subset of Z.
All members of N are in Z, but not all members of Z are in N.
What we need to find out is if Z can be put into a one to one correspondence with N. Your first
answer, given that N is a subset of Z, may be no but you would be wrong! In set theory, the
order of the elements is unimportant. There is no reason why we can't rearrange the elements
into any order we please as long as we don't leave any out. Z as presented above doesn't look
countable, but if we rewrite it as 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3 ..... and so on we can see that it is
countable.
Z   N
 0   1
-1   2
 1   3

97
-2   4
and so on. Strange indeed! A subset of Z (namely the natural numbers) has the same number of
members as Z itself? Infinite sets are not like ordinary finite sets. In fact this is sometimes used
as a definition of an infinite set. An infinite set is any set which can be put into a one to one
correspondence with at least one of its subsets. Rather than saying "The number of
members" of a set, people sometimes use the word cardinality or cardinal value. Z and N are
said to have the same cardinality.
Exercises
1. Is the number of even numbers the same as the natural numbers?
2. What about the number of square numbers?
3. Is the cardinality of positive even numbers less than 100 equal to the cardinality of natural
numbers less than 100? Which set is bigger? How do you know? In what ways do finite sets
differ from infinite ones?
4. Using the idea of one to one correspondance prove that infinity + 1 = infinity, what about infinity
+ A where A is a finite set? What about infinity plus C where C is a countably infinite set?
Is the set of rational numbers bigger than N?
In this section we will look to see if we can find a set that is bigger than the countable infinity
we have looked at so far. To illustrate the idea we can imagine a story.
There was once a criminal who went to prison. The prison was not a nice place so the poor
criminal went to the prison master and pleaded to be let out. She replied:
"Oh all right - I'm thinking of a number, every day you can have a go at guessing it. If you get
it correct, you can leave."
Now the question is - can the criminal get himself out of jail? (Think about if for a while before
you read on)
Obviously it depends on the number. If the prison master chooses a natural number, then the
criminal guesses 1, to first day, 2,the second day and so on until he reaches the correct number.
Likewise for the integers 0 on the first day, -1 on the second day. 1 on the third day and so on.
If the number is very large then it may take a long time to get out of prison but get out he will.
What the prison master needs to do is choose a set that is not countable in this way. Think of a
number line. The integers are widely spaced out. There are plenty of numbers inbetween the
integers 0&5 for example. So we need to look at denser sets. The first set that springs to most
peoples mind are the fractions. There are an infinite number of fractions between 0 and 1 so
surely there are more fractions than integers? Is it possible to count fractions? Let's think about
that possibility for a while. If we try to use the approach of counting all the fractions between 0
& 1 then go on to 1 - 2 and so on we will come unstuck becuase we will never finish counting

98
the ones up to 1 ( there are an infinite number of them). But does this mean that they are
uncountable ? Think of the situation with the integers. Ordering them ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... renders
them impossible to count, but reordering them 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, ... allows them to be counted.
There is in fact a way of ordering fractions to allow them to be counted. Before we go on to it
let's revert to the normal mathematical language. Mathematicians use the term rational number
to define what we have been calling fractions. A rational number is any number that can be
written in the form p/q where p and q are integers. So 3/4 is rational, as is -1/2. The set of all
rational numbers is usally called Q. Note that Z is a subset of Q becuase any integer can be
divided by 1 to make it into a rational. E.g. the number 3 can be written in the form p/q as 3/1.
Now as all the numbers in Q are defined by two numbers p and q it makes sense to write Q out
in the form of a table.
Note that this table isn't an exact representation of Q. It only has the positive members of Q and
has a number of multiple entries.( e.g. 1/1 and 2/2 are the same number) We shall call this set
Q'. It is simple enough to see that if Q' is countable then so is Q.
So how do we go about counting Q'? If we try counting the first row then the second and so on
we will fail because the rows are infinite in length. Likewise if we try to count columns. But
look at the diagonals. In one direction they are infinite ( e.g. 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, ...) but in the other
direction they are finite. So this set is countable. We count them along the finite diagonals, 1/1,
1/2, 2/1, 1/3, 2/2, 3/1....
Exercises
1. Adapt the method of counting the set Q' to show that thet Q is also countable. How will you
include 0 and the negative rationals? How will you solve the problem of multiple entries
representing the same number ?
2. Show that 
(provided that the infinites are both countable)
Can we find any sets that are bigger than N?
So far we have looked at N, Z, and Q and found them all to be the same size, even though N is
a subset of Z which is a subset of Q. You might be beginning to think "Is that it? Are all
infinities the same size?" In this section we will look at an set that is bigger than N. A set that
cannot be put into a one to one correspondence with N no matter how it is arranged.

99
The set in question is R the real numbers. A real number is any number on the number line that
is not in Q. Remember that the set Q contains all the numbers that can be written in the form
p/q with p and q rational. Most numbers can never be put in this form. Examples of irrational
numbers include Ï€,e, and 
.
The set R is huge! Much bigger than Q. To get a feel for the different sizes of these two infinite
sets consider the decimal expansions of a real number and a rational number. Rational numbers
always either terminate:
• 1/8 = 0.125
or repeat:
• 1/9 = 0.1111111......
Imagine measuring an object such as a book. If you use a ruler you might get 10cm. If you take
a bit more care to and read the mm you might get 10.2cm. You'd then have to go on to more
accurate measing devices such as vernier micrometers and find that you get 10.235cm. Going
onto a travelling microscope you may find its 10.235823cm and so on. In general the decimal
expansion of any real measurement will be a list of digits that look completely random.
Now imagine you measure a book and found it to be 10.101010101010cm. You'd be pretty
surprised wouldn't you? But this is exactly the sort of result you would need to get if the book's
length were rational. Rational numbers are dense (you find them all over the number line),
infinite, yet much much rarer than real numbers.
How we can prove that R is bigger than Q
It's good to get a feel for the size of infinities as in the previous section. But to be really sure we
have to come up with some form of proof. In order to prove that R is bigger than Q we use a
classic method. We assume that R is the same size as Q and come up with a contradiction. For
the sake of clarity we will restrict our proof to the real numbers between 0 and 1.We will call
this set R' Clearly if we can prove that R' is bigger than Q then R must be bigger than Q also.
If R' was the same size as Q it would mean that it is countable. This means that we would be
able to write out some form of list of all the members of R (This is what countable means, so
far we have managed to write out all our infinite sets in the form of an infinitely long list). Let's
consider this list.
R1
R2
R3
R4
.

100
.
.
Where R1 is the first number in our list, R2 is the second, and so on. Note that we haven't said
what order the list is to be written. For this proof we don't need to say what the order of the list
needs to be, only that the mermbers of R are listable (hence countable).
Now lets write out the decimal expansion of each of the numbers in the list.
0.r11r12r13r14...
0.r21r22r23r24...
0.r31r32r33r44...
0.r41r42r43r44...
.
.
.
Here r11 means the first digit after the decimal point of the first number in the list. So if our first
number happened to be 0.36921... r11 would be 3, r12 would be 6 and so on. Remember that this
list is meant to be complete. By that we mean that it contains every member of R'. What we are
going to do in order to prove that R is not countable is to construct a number that is not already
on the list. Since the list is supposed to contain every member of R', this will cause a
contradiction and therfore show that R' is unlistable.
In order to construct this unlisted number we choose a decimal representation:
0.a1a2a3a4...
Where a1 is the first digit after the point etc.
We let a1 take any value from 0 - 9 inclusive except the digit r11. So if r11 = 3 then a1 can be 0,
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Then we let a2 be any digit except r22 (the second digit of the second
number on the list). Then a3 be any digit except r33 and so on.
Now if this number, that we have just constructed were on the list somewhere then it would
have to be equal to Rsomething. Let's see what Rsomething it might be equal to. It can't be equal to R1
because it has a different first digit (r11 and a1. Nor can it be equal to R2 because it has a
different second digit, and so on. In fact it can't be equal to any number on the list becuse it
differs by at least one digit from all of them.
We have done what we set out to do. We have constructed a number that is in R but is not on
the "list of all members of R". This means that R is bigger than any list. It is not listable. It is

101
not countable. It is a bigger infinity than Q.
Are there even bigger infinities?
There are but they are difficult to describe. The set of all the possible combinations of any
number of real numbers is a bigger infinity than R. However trying to imagine such a set is
mind boggling. Let's look instead at a set that looks like it should be bigger than R but turns out
not to be.
Remember R', which we defined earlier on as the set of all numbers on the number line
between 0 and 1. Let us now consider the set of all numbers in the plane from [0,0] to [1,1]. At
first sight it would seem obvious that there must be more points on the whole plane than there
are in a line. But in transfinite mathematics the "obvious" is not always true and proof is the
only way to go. Cantor spent three years trying to prove it true but failed. His reason for failure
was the best possible. It's false.
Each point in this plane is specified by two numbers, the x coordinate and the y coordinate; x
and y both belong to R. Lets consider one point in the line. 0.a1a2a3a4.... Can you think of a way
of using this one number to specify a point in the plane ? Likewise can you think of a way of
combining the two numbers x= 0.x1x2x3x4.... and y= 0.y1y2y3y4.... to specify a point on the line?
(think about it before you read on)
One way is to do it is to take
a1 = x1
a2 = y1
a3 = x2
a4 = y2
.

102
.
.
This defines a one to one correspondence between the points in the plane and the points in the
line. (Actually, for the sharp amongst you, not quite one to one. Can you spot the problem and
how to cure it?)
Exercises
1. Prove that the number of points in a cube is the same as the number of points on one of its sides.
Continuum hypothesis
We shall end the section on infinite sets by looking at the Continuum hypothesis. This
hypothesis states that there are no infinities between the natural numbers and the real numbers.
Cantor came up with a number system for transfinite numbers. He called the smallest infinity
with the next biggest one 
and so on. It is easy to prove that the cardinality of N is 
(Write any smaller infinity out as a list. Either the list terminates, in which case it's finite, or it
goes on forever, in which case it's the same size as N) but is the cardinality of the reals = 
?
To put it another way, the hypotheses states that:
There are no infinite sets larger than the set of natural numbers but smaller than the set of real

Limits Infinity got rid of
The theory of infinite sets seems weird to us in the 21st century, but in Cantor's day it was
downright unpalatable for most mathematicians. In those days the idea of infinity was too
troublesome, they tried to avoid it wherever possible.

103
Unfortunately the mathematical topic called analysis was found to be highly useful in
mathematics, physics, engineering. It was far too useful a field to simply drop yet analysis
relies on infinity or at least infinite processes. To get around this problem the idea of a limit
was invented.
Consider the series
This series is called the harmonic series.
Note that the terms of the series get smaller and smaller as you go further and further along the
series. What happens if we let n become infinite? The term would become 
But this doesn't make sense. (Mathematicians consider it sloppy to divide by infinity. Infinity is
not a normal number, you can't divide by it). A better way to think about it (The way you
probably already do think about it, if you've ever considered the matter) is to take this
approach: Infinity is very big, bigger than any number you care to think about. So let's let n
become bigger and bigger and see if 1/n approaches some fixed number. In this case as n gets
bigger and bigger 1/n gets smaller and smaller. So it is reasonable to say that the limit is 0.
In mathematics we write this as
and it reads:
the limit of 1/n as n approaches infinity is zero
Note that we are not dividing 1 by infinity and getting the answer 0. We are letting the number
n get bigger and bigger and so the reciprocal gets closer and closer to zero. Those 18th Century
mathematicians loved this idea because it got rid of the pesky idea of dividing by infinity. At all
times n remains finite. Of course, no matter how huge n is, 1/n will not be exactly equal to zero,
there is always a small difference. This difference (or error) is usually denoted by Îµ (epsilon).
info -- infinitely small
When we talk about infinity, we think of it as something big. But there is also the infinitely
small, denoted by Îµ (epsilon). This animal is closer to zero than any other number.
Mathematicians also use the character Îµ to represent anything small. For example, the
famous Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdos used to refer to small children as epsilons.

104
Examples
Lets look at the function
What is the limit as x approaches infinity ?
This is where the idea of limits really come into its own. Just replacing x with infinity gives us
very little:
But by using limits we can solve it
For our second example consider this limit as x approaches infinity of x3 - x2
Again lets look at the wrong way to do it. Substituting 
into the expression gives
. Note that you cannot say that these two infinities just cancel out to give the
answer zero.
Now lets look at doing it the correct way, using limits
The last expression is two functions multiplied together. Both of these functions approach
infinity as x approaches infinity, so the product is infinity also. This means that the limit does
not exist, i.e. there is no finite number that the function approaches as x gets bigger and bigger.
One more just to get you really familer with how it works. Calculate:
To make things very clear we shall rewrite it as
Now to calculate this limit we need to look at the properties of sin(x). Sin(x)is a function that
you should already be familiar with (or you soon will be) its value oscillates between 1 and -1

105
depending on x. This means that the absolute value of sin(x) (the value ignoring the plus or
minus sign) is always less than or equal to 1:
So we have 1/x which we already know goes to zero as x goes to infinity multiplied by sin(x)
which always remains finite no matter how big x gets. This gives us

Infinite series
Consider the infinite sum 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + .... Do you think that this sum will
equal infinity once all the terms have been added ? Let's sum the first few terms.
Can you guess what 
is ?
Here is another way of looking at it. Imagine a point on a number line moving along as the sum
progresses. In the first term the point jumps to the position 1. This is half way from 0 to 2. In
the second stage the point jumps to position 1.5 - half way from 1 to 2. At each stage in the
process (shown in a different colour on the diagram) the distance to 2 is halved. The point can

106
get as close to the point 2 as you like. You just need to do the appropriate number of jumps, but
the point will never actually reach 2 in a finite number of steps. We say that in the limit as n
approaches infinity, Sn approaches 2.
Zeno's Paradox
The ancient Greeks had a big problem with summing infinite series. A famous paradox from
the philosopher Zeno is as follows:
In the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, we imagine the Greek hero Achilles in a footrace
with the plodding reptile. Because he is so fast a runner, Achilles graciously allows the tortoise
a head start of a hundred feet. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant
speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run a
hundred feet, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point.
During this time, the tortoise has "run" a (much shorter) distance, say one foot. It will then take
Achilles some further period of time to run that distance, during which the tortoise will advance
farther; and then another period of time to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves
ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has farther to
go. Therefore, Zeno says, swift Achilles can never overtake the tortoise.

How big is infinity? exercises
1. The number of even numbers is the same as the number of natural numbers because both are
countably infinite. You can clearly see the one to one correspondence. (E means even numbers
and is not an official set like N)

3. The cardinality of even numbers less than 100 is not equal to the cardinality of natural
numbers less than 100. You can simply write out both of them and count the numbers. Then
you will see that cardinality of even numbers less than 100 is 49 and the cardinality of natural
numbers less than 100 is 99. Thus the set of natural numbers less than 100 is bigger than the set

108
of even numbers less than 100. The big difference between infinite and finite sets thus is that a
finite set can not be put into one to one correspondence with any of it's subsets. While an
infinite set can be put into one to one correspondence with at least one of it's subsets.
4. Each part of the sum is answered below
infinity + 1 = infinity
You can prove this by taking a set with a cardinality of 1, for example a set consisting only of
the number 0. You simply add this set in front of the countably infinite set to put the infinite set
and the inifinite+1 set into one to one correspondence.
N   N+1

infinity + A = infinity (where A is a finite set)
You simply add the finite set in front of the infinite set like above, only the finite set doesn't
need to have a cardinality of one anymore.
infinity + C = infinity (where C is a countably infinite set)
You take one item of each set (infinity or C) in turns, this will make the new list also countably
infinite.
Is the set of rational numbers bigger than N? exercises
1. To change the matrix from Q' to Q the first step you need to take is to remove the multiple
entries for the same number. You can do this by leaving an empty space in the table when
gcd(topnr,bottomnr) ≠ 1 because when the gcd isn't 1 the fraction can be simplified by dividing
the top and bottom number by the gcd. This will leave you with the following table.
Now we only need to add zero to the matrix and we're finished. So we add a vertical row for
zero and only write the topmost element in it (0/1) (taking gcd doesn't work here because

109
gcd(0,a)=a) This leaves us with the following table where we have to count all fractions in the
diagonal rows to see that Q is countably infinite.
2. To show that 
you have to make a table where you put one infinity in the
horizontal row and one infinity in the vertical row. Now you can start counting the number of
place in the table diagonally just like Q' was counted. This works because a table of size AxB
contains A*B places.
Are there even bigger infinities? exercises
1. You have to use a method to map the coordinates in a plain onto a point on the line and the other
way around, like the one described in the text. This method shows you that for every number
on the line there is a place on the plain and for every place on the plain there is a place on the
line. Thus the number of points on the line and the plain are the same. Limits Infinity got rid of

Generating functions
..some motivation to be written
Generating functions, otherwise known as Formal Power Series, are useful for solving
problems like:
x1 + x2 + 2x3 = m
where
; n = 1, 2, 3
how many unique solutions are there if m = 55?
Before we tackle that problem, let's consider the infinite polynomial:
S = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + ... + xn + xn + 1...
We want to obtain a closed form of this infinite polynomial. The closed form is simply a way of
expressing the polynomial so that it involves only a finite number of operations.
So the closed form of
1 + x + x2 + x3 + ...

111
is
We can equate them (actually, we can't. Refer to info).
info - Infinite sums
The two expressions are not equal. It's just that for certain values of x (-1 < x < 1), we can
approximate the right hand side as closely as possible by adding up a large number of terms
on the left hand side. For example, suppose x = 1/2, RHS = 2; we approximate the LHS
using only 5 terms we get LHS equals 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 1.9375, which is close to
2, as you can imagine by adding more and more terms, we will get closer and closer to 2.
For a more detailed discussion of the above, head to Infinity and infinite processes.
Anyway we really only care about its nice algebraic properties not its numerical value. From
now on we will omit the condition for equality to be true when writing out generating
functions.
Consider a more general case:
S = A + ABx + AB2x2 + AB3x3 + ...
where A and B are constants.
We can derive the closed-form as follows:
The following identity as derived above is worth investing time and effort memorising.
Exercises
1. Find the closed-form:

112
(a)1 - z + z2 - z3 + z4 - z5 + ...
(b)1 + 2z + 4z2 + 8z3 + 16z4 + 32z5 + ...
(c)z + z2 + z3 + z4 + z5 + ...
(d)3 - 4z + 4z2 - 4z3 + 4z4 - 4z5 + ...
(e)1 - z2 + z4 - z6 + z8 - z10 + ...
2. Given the closed-form, find a function f(n) for the coefficients of xn:
(a)
 (Hint: note the plus sign in the denominator)
(b)
 (Hint: obtain the generating function for 1/(1 - z^2) first, then multiply by the
appropriate expression)
(c)
 (Hint: break into the sum of two distinct close forms)
Method of Substitution
We are given that:
1 + z + z2 + ... = 1/(1 - z)
and we can obtain many other generating functions by substitution. For example: letting z = x2
we have:
1 + x2 + x4 + ... = 1/(1 - x2)
Similarly
A + ABx + A(Bx)2 + ... = A/(1 - Bx)
is obtained by letting z = Bx then multiplying the whole expression by A.

Linear Recurrence Relations
The Fibonacci series
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55...
where each and every number, except the first two, is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
We say the numbers are related if the value a number takes depends on the values that come
before it in the sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a recurrence relation, it is
expressed as:
where xn is the (n+ 1)th number in the sequence. Note that the first number in the sequence is
denoted x0. Given this recurrence relation, the question we want to ask is "can we find a
formula for the (n+1)th number in the sequence?". The answer is yes, but before we come to
that, let's look at some examples.
Example 1
The expressions
define a recurrence relation. The sequence is: 1, 1, 5, 13, 41, 121, 365... Find a formula for the
(n+1)th number in the sequence.
Solution Let G(z) be generating function of the sequence, meaning the coefficient of each
power (in ascending order) is the corresponding number in the sequence. So the generating
functions looks like this
G(z) = 1 + z + 5z2 + 13z3 + 41z4 + 121z5 + ...
Now, by a series of algebraic manipulations, we can find the closed form of the generating
function and from that the formula for each coefficient

114
by definition xn - 2xn - 1 - 3xn - 2 = 0
by the method of partial fractions we get:
each part of the sum is in a recognisable closed-form. We can conclude that:
the reader can easily check the accuracy of the formula.
Example 2
Find a non-recurrent formula for xn.
Solution Let G(z) be the generating function of the sequence described above.
G(z) = x0 + x1z + x2z2 + ...

115
Therefore xn = 1, for all n.
Example 3
A linear recurrence relation is defined by:
Find the general formula for xn.
Solution Let G(z) be the generating function of the recurrence relation.
G(z)(1 - z - 6z2) = x0 + (x1 - x0)z + (x2 - x1 - 6x0)z2 + ...
G(z)(1 - z - 6z2) = 1 + z2 + z3 + z4 + ...
G(z)(1 - z - 6z2) = 1 + z2(1 + z + z2 + ...)
Therefore
Exercises
1. Derive the formula for the (n+1)th numbers in the sequence defined by the linear recurrence
relations:

116
2. Derive the formula for the (n+1)th numbers in the sequence defined by the linear recurrence
relations:
3. (Optional) Derive the formula for the (n+1)th Fibonacci numbers.
Further Counting
Consider the equation
a + b = n; a, b ≥ 0 are integers
For a fixed positive integer n, how many solutions are there? We can count the number of
solutions:
0 + n = n
1 + (n - 1) = n
2 + (n - 2) = n
...
n + 0 = n
As you can see there are (n + 1) solutions. Another way to solve the problem is to consider the
generating function
G(z) = 1 + z + z2 + ... + zn
Let H(z) = G(z)G(z), i.e.
H(z) = (1 + z + z2 + ... + zn)2
I claim that the coefficient of zn in H(z) is the number of solutions to a + b = n, a, b > 0. The
reason why lies in the fact that when multiplying like terms, indices add.
Consider
A(z) = 1 + z + z2 + z3 + ...
Let

117
B(z) = A2(z)
it follows
B(z) = (1 + z + z2 + z3 + ...) + z(1 + z + z2 + z3 + ...) + z2(1 + z + z2 + z3 + ...) + z3(1 + z + z2 +
z3) + ...
B(z) = 1 + 2z + 3z2 + ...
Now the coefficient of zn (for n ≥ 0) is clearly the number of solutions to a + b = n (a, b > 0).
We are ready now to derive a very important result: let tk be the number solutions to a + b = n
(a, b > 0). Then the generating function for the sequence tk is
T(z) = (1 + z + z2 + ... + zn + ...)(1 + z + z2 + ... + zn + ...)
i.e.
Counting Solutions to a1 + a2 + ... + am = n
Consider the number of solutions to the following equation:
a1 + a2 + ... + am = n
where ai ≥ 0; i = 1, 2, ... m. By applying the method discussed previously. If tk is the number of
solutions to the above equation when n = k. The generating function for tk is
but what is tk? Unless you have learnt calculus, it's hard to derive a formula just by looking the
equation of T(z). Without assuming knowledge of calculus, we consider the following counting
problem.
"You have three sisters, and you have n (n ≥ 3) lollies. You decide to give each of your sisters
at least one lolly. In how many ways can this be done?"
One way to solve the problem is to put all the lollies on the table in a straightline. Since there
are n lollies there are (n - 1) gaps between them (just as you have 5 fingers on each hand and 4
gaps between them). Now get 2 dividers, from the (n - 1) gaps available, choose 2 and put a
divider in each of the gaps you have chosen! There you have it, you have divided the n lollies

118
into three parts, one for each sister. There are 
ways to do it! If you have 4 sisters,
then there are 
ways to do it. If you have m sisters there are 
ways to do
it.
Now consider: "You have three sisters, and you have n lollies. You decide to give each of your
sisters some lollies (with no restriction as to how much you give to each sister). In how many
ways can this be done?"
Please note that you are just solving:
a1 + a2 + a3 = n
where ai ≥ 0; i = 1, 2, 3.
You can solve the problem by putting n + 3 lollies on the table in a straightline. Get two
dividers and choose 2 gaps from the n + 2 gaps available. Now that you have divided n + 3
lollies into 3 parts, with each part having 1 or more lollies. Now take back 1 lollies from each
part, and you have solved the problem! So the number of solutions is 
. More
generally, if you have m sisters and n lollies the number of ways to share the lollies is
.
Now to the important result, as discussed above the number of solutions to
a1 + a2 + ... + am = n
where ai ≥ 0; i = 1, 2, 3 ... m is
i.e.
Example 1
The closed form of a generating function T(z) is

119
and tk in the coefficient of zk is T(z). Find an explicit formula for tk.
Solution
Therefore tk = k
Example 2
Find the number of solutions to:
a + b + c + d = n
for all positive integers n (including zero) with the restriction a, b, c ,d ≥ 0.
Solution By the formula
so
the number of solutions is 
More Counting
We turn to a sligthly harder problem of the same kind. Suppose we are to count the number of
solutions to:
2a + 3b + c = n
for some integer 
, with a, b, also c greater than or equal zero. We can write down the
closed form straight away, we note the coefficient of xn of:

120
is the required solution. This is due to, again, the fact that when multiplying powers, indices
add.
To obtain the number of solutions, we break the expression into recognisable closed-forms by
method of partial fraction.
Example 1
Let sk be the number of solutions to the following equation:
2a + 2b = n; a, b ≥ 0
Find the generating function for sk, then find an explicit formula for sn in terms of n.
Solution
Let T(z) be the generating functions of tk
T(z) = (1 + z2 + z4 + ... + z2n + ...)2
It's not hard to see that
Example 2
Let tk be the number of solutions to the following equation:
a + 2b = n; a, b ≥ 0
Find the generating function for tk, then find an explicit formula for tn in terms of n.
Solution
Let T(z) be the generating functions of tk
T(z) = (1 + z + z2 + ... + zn + ...)(1 + z2 + z4 + ... + z2n + ...)

121
A = -1/4, B = 3/4, C = 1/4

Discrete Probability
Introduction
Probability theory is one of the most widely applicable mathematical theories. It deals with
uncertainty and teaches you how to manage it. It is simply one of the most useful theories you
will ever learn.
Please do not misunderstand. We are not learning to predict things, rather we learn to utilise
predicted chances and make them useful. Therefore, we don't care, what is the probability it
will rain tomorrow?, but given the probability is 60% we can make deductions, the easiest of
which is the probability it will not rain tomorrow is 40%.
As suggested above, a probability is a percentage and it's between 0% and 100% (inclusive).
Mathematicians like to express a probability as a proportion i.e. as a number between 0 and 1.
info - Why discrete?
Probability comes in two flavours, discrete and continuous. The continuous case is
considered to be far more difficult to understand, and much less intuitive, than discrete
probability and it requires knowledge of calculus. But we will touch on a little bit of the
continuous case later on in the chapter.
Event and Probability
Roughly, an event is something we can assign a probability to. For example the probability it
will rain tomorrow is 0.6, in here the event is it will rain tomorrow the assigned probability is
0.6. We can write
P(it will rain tomorrow) = 0.6
as mathematicians like to do we can use abstract letters to represent events. In this case we
choose A to represent the event it will rain tomorrow, so the above expression can be written as
P(A) = 0.6
Another example a fair die will turn up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 equally probably each time it is tossed.
Let B be the event that it turns up 1 in the next toss, we write
P(B) = 1/6
Misconception
Please note that the probability 1/6 does not mean that it will turns up 1 in at most six tries.
Its precise meaning will be discussed later on in the chapter. Roughly, it just means that on
the long run (i.e. the die being tossed a large number of times), the proportion of 1's will be

133
very close to 1/6.
Impossible and Certain events
Two types of events are special. One type are the impossible events (e.g., the sum of digits of a
two-digit number is greater than 18); the other type are certain to happen (e.g., a roll of a die
will turn up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6). The probability of an impossible event is 0, while that of a
certain event is 1. We write
P(Impossible event) = 0
P(Certain event) = 1
The above reinforces a very important principle concerning probability. Namely, the range of
probability is between 0 and 1. You can never have a probability of 2.5! So remember the
following
for all events E.
Complement of an event
A most useful concept is the complement of an event. We use :
 to represent the event that
the die will NOT turn up 1 in the next toss. Generally, putting a bar over a variable (that
represents an event) means the opposite of that event. In the above case of a die:
it means the die will turn up 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 in the next toss has probability 5/6. Please note that
for any event E.
Combining independent probabilities
It is interesting how independent probabilities can be combined to yield probabilities for more
complex events. I stress the word independent here, because the following demonstrations will
not work without that requirement. The exact meaning of the word will be discussed a little
later on in the chapter, and we will show why independence is important in Exercise 10 of this
section.
Adding probabilities
Probabilities are added together whenever an event can occur in multiple "ways." As this is a
rather loose concept, the following example may be helpful. Consider rolling a single die; if we
want to calculate the probability for, say, rolling an odd number, we must add up the

134
probabilities for all the "ways" in which this can happen -- rolling a 1, 3, or 5. Consequently,
we come to the following calculation:
P(rolling an odd number) = P(rolling a 1) + P(rolling a 3) + P(rolling a 5) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 =
3/6 = 1/2 = 50%
Note that the addition of probabilities is often associated with the use of the word "or" --
whenever we say that some event E is equivalent to any of the events X, Y, or Z occurring, we
use addition to combine their probabilities.
A general rule of thumb is that the probability of an event and the probability of its complement
must add up to 1. This makes sense, since we intuitively believe that events, when well-
defined, must either happen or not happen.
Multiplying probabilities
Probabilities are multiplied together whenever an event occurs in multiple "stages" or "steps."
For example, consider rolling a single die twice; the probability of rolling a 6 both times is
calculated by multiplying the probabilities for the individual steps involved. Intuitively, the first
step is simply the first roll, and the second step is the second roll. Therefore, the final
probability for rolling a 6 twice is as follows:
P(rolling a 6 twice) = P(rolling a 6 the first time)
P(rolling a 6 the second time) = 
=
1/36 
2.8%
Similarly, note that the multiplication of probabilities is often associated with the use of the
word "and" -- whenever we say that some event E is equivalent to all of the events X, Y, and Z
occurring, we use multiplication to combine their probabilities.
Also, it is important to recognize that the product of multiple probabilities must be less than or
equal to each of the individual probabilities, since probabilities are restricted to the range 0
through 1. This agrees with our intuitive notion that relatively complex events are usually less
likely to occur.
Combining addition and multiplication
It is often necessary to use both of these operations simultaneously. Once again, consider one
die being rolled twice in succession. In contrast with the previous case, we will now consider
the event of rolling two numbers that add up to 3. In this case, there are clearly two steps
involved, and therefore multiplication will be used, but there are also multiple ways in which
the event under consideration can occur, meaning addition must be involved as well. The die
could turn up 1 on the first roll and 2 on the second roll, or 2 on the first and 1 on the second.
This leads to the following calculation:
P(rolling a sum of 3) = P(1 on 1st roll)
P(2 on 2nd roll) + P(2 on 1st roll)
P(1 on 2nd roll)

135
= 
+ 
= 1/18 
5.5%
This is only a simple example, and the addition and multiplication of probabilities can be used
to calculate much more complex probabilities.
Exercises
Let A represent the number that turns up in a (fair) die roll, let C represent the number that turns
up in a separate (fair) die roll, and let B represent a card randomly picked out of a deck:
1. A die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a 3 i.e. calculate P(A = 3)?
2. A die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a 2, 3, or 5 i.e. calculate P(A = 2) + P(A =
3) + P(A = 5)?
3. What is the probability of choosing a card of the suit Diamonds? 4. A die is rolled and a card
is randomly picked from a deck of cards. What is the probability of rolling a 4 and picking the
Ace of spades, i.e. calculate P(A = 4)×P(B = Ace of spades).
5. Two dice are rolled. What is the probability of getting a 1 followed by a 3?
6. Two dice are rolled. What is the probability of getting a 1 and a 3, regardless of order?
7. Calculate the probability of rolling two numbers that add up to 7.
8. (Optional) Show the probability of C is equal to A is 1/6.
9. What is the probability that C is greater than A?
10. Gareth was told that in his class 50% of the pupils play football, 30% play video games and
30% study mathematics. So if he was to choose a student from the class randomly, he
calculated the probability that the student plays football, video games or studies mathematics is
50% + 30% + 30% = 1/2 + 3/10 + 3/10 = 11/10. But all probabilities should be between 0 and
1. What mistake did Gareth make?
Solutions
1. P(A = 3) = 1/6
2. P(A = 2) + P(A = 3) + P(A = 5) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2
3. P(B = Ace of Diamonds) + ... + P(B = King of Diamonds) = 13 × 1/52 = 1/4
4. P(A = 4) × P(B = Ace of Spades) = 1/6 × 1/52 = 1/312
5. P(A = 1) × P(A = 3) = 1/36
6. P(A = 1) × P(A = 3) + P(A = 3) × P(A = 1) = 1/36 + 1/36 = 1/18

136
7. Here are the possible combinations: 1 + 6 = 2 + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7. Probability of getting each of
the combinations are 1/18 as in Q6. There are 3 such combinations, so the probability is 3 ×
1/18 = 1/6.
9. Since both dice are fair, C > A is just as likely as C < A. So
P(C > A) = P(C < A)
and
P(C > A) + P(C < A) + P(A = C) = 1
But
P(A = C) = 1/6
so P(C > A) = 5/12.
10. For example, some of those 50% who play football may also study mathematics. So we can
not simply add them.
Random Variables
A random experiment, such as throwing a die or tossing a coin, is a process that produces some
uncertain outcome. We also require that a random experiments can be repeated easily. In this
section we shall start using a capital letter to represent the outcome of a random experiment.
For example, let D be the outcome of a die roll, D could take the value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, but it is
uncertain. We say D is a random variable. Suppose now I throw a die, and it turns up 5, we say
the observed value of D is 5.
A random variable is simply the outcome of a certain random experiment. It is usually denoted
by a CAPITAL letter, but its observed value is not. For example let
D1,D2,...,Dn
denote the outcome of n die throws, then we usually use
d1,d2,...,dn
to denoted the observed values of each of Di's.
From here on, random variable may be abbreviated as simply rv (a common abbreviation in
other probability literatures).
The Bernoulli
This section is optional and it assumes knowledge of binomial expansion.
A Bernoulli experiment is basically a "coin-toss". If we toss a coin, we will expect to get a head

137
or a tail equally probably. A Bernoulli experiment is slightly more versatile than that, in that the
two possible outcomes need not have the same probability.
In a Bernoulli experiment you will either get a
success, denoted by 1, with proability p (where p is a number between 0 and 1)
or a
failure, denoted by 0, with probaility 1 - p.
If the random variable B is the outcome of a Bernoulli experiment, and the probability of
getting a 1 is p, we say B comes from a Bernoulli distribution with success probability p and
we write:
For example, if
then
P(C = 1) = 0.65
and
P(C = 0) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35
Binomial Distribution
Suppose we want to repeat the Bernoulli experiment n times, then we get a binomial
distribution. For example:
for i = 1, 2, ... , n. That is, there are n variables C1, C2, ... , Cn and they all come from the same
Bernoulli distribution. We consider:
B = C1 + C2 + ... + Cn
, then B is simply the rv that counts the number of successes in n trials (experiments). Such a
variables is called a binomial variable, and we write
Example 1
Aditya, Gareth, and John are equally able. Their probability of scoring 100 in an exam follows

138
a Bernoulli distribution with success probability 0.9. What is the probability of
i) One of them getting 100?
ii) Two of them getting 100?
iii) All 3 getting 100?
iv) None getting 100?
Solution
We are dealing with a binomial variable, which we will call B. And
i) We want to calculate
P(B = 1)
The probability of any of them getting 100 (success) and the other two getting below 100
(failure) is
but there are 3 possible candidates for getting 100 so
ii) We want to calculate
P(B = 2)
The probability is
but there are 
combinations of candidates for getting 100, so
iii) To calculate
iv) The probability of "None getting 100" is getting 0 success, so

The above example strongly hints at the fact the binomial distribution is connected with the
binomial expansion. The following result regarding the binomial distribution is provided
without proof, the reader is encouraged to check its correctness.

Events
In the previous sections, we have slightly abused the use of the word event. An event should be
thought of as a collection of random outcomes of a certain rv.
Let us introduce some notations first. Let A and B be two events, we define
to be the event of A and B. We also define
to be the event of A or B. As demonstrated in exercise 10 above,
in general.
Let's see some examples. Let A be the event of getting a number less than or equal to 4 when
tossing a die, and let B be the event of getting an odd number. Now
P(A) = 2/3
and
P(B) = 1/2
but the probability of A or B does not equal to the sum of the probabilities, as below

141
as 7/6 is greater than 1.
It is not difficult to see that the event of throwing a 1 or 3 is included in both A and B. So if we
simply add P(A) and P(B), some events' probabilities are being added twice!
The Venn diagram below should clarify the situation a little more,
think of the blue square as the probability of B and the yellow square as the probability of A.
These two probabilities overlap, and where they do is the probability of A and B. So the
probability of A or B should be:
The above formula is called the Simple Inclusion Exclusion Formula.
If for events A and B, we have
we say A and B are disjoint. The word means to separate. If two events are disjoint we have
the following Venn diagram representing them:

142
info -- Venn Diagram
Traditionally, Venn Diagrams are used to illustrate sets graphically. A set being simply a collection
of things, e.g. {1, 2, 3} is a set consisting of 1, 2 and 3. Note that Venn diagrams are usually drawn
round. It is generally very difficult to draw Venn diagrams for more than 3 intersecting sets. E.g.
below is a Venn diagram showing four intersecting sets:
Expectation
The expectation of a random variable can be roughly thought of as the long term average of the
outcome of a certain repeatable random experiment. By long term average it is meant that if we
perform the underlying experiment many times and average the outcomes. For example, let D
be as above, the observed values of D (1,2 ... or 6) are equally likely to occur. So if you were to
toss the die a large number of times, you would expect each of the numbers to turn up roughly
an equal number of times. So the expectation is
. We denote the expection of D by E(D), so
E(D) = 3.5
We should now properly define the expectation.
Consider a random variable R, and suppose the possible values it can take are r1, r2, r3, ... , rn.
We define the expectation to be
E(R) = r1P(R = r1) + r2P(R = r2) + ... + rnP(R = rn)
Think about it: Taking into account the expectation is the long term average of the outcomes.
Can you explain why is E(R) defined the way it is?
Example 1 In a fair coin toss, let 1 represent tossing a head and 0 a tail. The same coin is
tossed 8 times. Let C be a random variable representing the number of heads in 8 tosses? What
is the expectation of C, i.e. calculate E(C)?

Financial Options
Binary tree option pricing
Introduction
We have all heard of at least one stock exchange. NASDAQ, Dow Jones, FTSE and Hang
Sheng. Less well-known, but more useful to many people, are the future exchanges. A stock
exchange allows stock brokers to trade company stocks, while the future exchanges allow more
exotic derivatives to be traded. For example, financial options, which is also the focus of this
chapter.
An option is a contract that gives the holder the choice to buy (or sell) a certain good in some
time in the future for a certain price. What are options for? Initially, they are used to protect
against risk. But they are also used to take advantage foreseeable opportunities, like what
Thales has done1.
Thales, the great Greek philosopher, was credited with the first recorded use of an option in the
western world. A popular anecdote suggests, in one particular year while still in winter, he
forecasted a great harvest of olives in the coming year. He had next to no money, so he
purchased the option for the use of all the olive presses in his area. Naturally, when the time to
harvest came everyone wanted to use the presses he had optioned! Needless to say he made a
lot of money out of it.
Basics
An option is a contract of choice. You can choose whether to exercise the option or not.
If you own an option that states
You may purchase 1 kg of sugar from Shop A tomorrow for $2
suppose tomorrow the market price of sugar is $3, you would want to exercise the option i.e.
buy the sugar for $2. Then you would sell it for $3 on the market and make $1 in the process.
But if the market price for 1 kg of sugar is $1, then you would choose not to exercise the
option, because it's cheaper on the market.
Let us be a little bit more formal about what an option is. In particular there are two types of
option:
Call Option
A call option is a contract that gives the owner the option to buy an 'underlying stock' at the
'strike price', on the 'expiry date'.
Put Option

145
A put option is a contract that gives the owner the option to sell an 'underlying stock' at the
'strike price', on the 'expiry date'.
In the above example, the 'underlying stock' was sugar and the 'strike price' $2 and 'expiry date'
is tomorrow.
We shall represent an option like below
{C or P, $amount, # periods to expiry}
. For example
{C,$3,1}
represents a call option with strike price for some unspecified underlying stock expiring in one
time-unit's time. A time-unit here may be a year, a month, one day or one hour. The important
point is the mathematics we will present later does not really depend on what this time-unit is.
Also, we need not specify the underlying stock either. Another example
{P,$100,2}
represents a put option with strike price $100 for some unspecified underlying stock expiring in
2 time-units' time.
Now that we have a basic idea of what an option is, we can start to imagine a market place
where options are traded. We assume that such a market exists. Also we assume that there is no
fee of any kind to participate in a trade. Such a market is called a frictionless market. Of course,
a market place where the underlying stock is traded is also assumed to exist.
Info -- American or European
Actually there are two major types of options: American or European. An European option
allows you to exercise the option only on the 'expiry date'; while the American version allows
you to exercise the option at any time prior to the 'expiry date'. We shall only discuss European
options in this chapter.
Arbitrage
Another very important concept is arbitrage. In short, an arbitrage is a way to make money out
of nothing. We assume that there is no free-lunch in this world, in other words our market is
arbitrage-free. We will show an example of how to perform an arbitrage later on in the chapter.
The real meat of this chapter is the technique used to price the options. In simple terms, we
have an option, how much should it be? From this angle, we will see that the arbitrage-free
requirement is a very strong one, in that it basically dictates what the price of the option should
be.

146
Option's value on expiry
Pricing the option is about how much is it worth now. Of course the present value of an option
depends on its possible future values. Therefore it is vital to understand how much the option is
worth at expiry, when it is time to choose whether to exercise the option or not. For example,
consider the option
{C,$2,1}
it is the call (buy) option that expires in 1 week's time (or day or year or whatever time period it
is suppose to be). How much should the option be if the market price of the underlying stock on
expiry is $3? What if the market price is $1?
It is sensible to say the option has a value of $1 if the market price (for the underlying stock) is
$3, and the option should be worthless ($0) if the market price is $1.
Why do we say it is sensible to price the option as above? It is because we assume the market is
arbitrage-free. Also in a market, we assume
• there is a bank that's willing to lend you money
• if you repay the bank in the same day you borrowed, no fee will be charged.
With those assumptions, we show that if you price the option any differently, someone can
make money without using any of his/her own money. For example, suppose on expiry, the
market price for the underlying stock is $3 and you decide to sell the option for $0.7 (not $1 as
is sensible). An intelligent buyer would do the following:
Action
Money
Balance
Borrow $2.7
+$2.7
$2.7
Purchase your option for $0.7
-$0.7
$2
Purchase sugar for $2 with option
-$2
$0
Sell 1kg of sugar for $3 in market
+$3
$3
Repay bank $2.7
-$2.7
$0.3
He/she made $0.3 and at no time did he/she use his/her own money (i.e. balance never less than
zero)! This is a free lunch, which is contrary to the assumption of a arbitrage-free market!
Exercises
1. In an arbitrage-free market, consdier an option T = {C,$100,1}.
i) How much should the option be on expiry if the price of the underlying stock is $90.

147
ii) What if the underlying stock costs $110 on expiry.
iii} $100?
2. Consdier an option T = {C,$10,1}.
i) On expiry, would you consider buying the option if it was for sell for $2 if the underlying
stock costs $8?
ii) What if the underlying stock costs $7.
3. Consider the put option T = {P,$2,1}. On expiry the underlying stock costs $1. Jenny owns
T, she decides on the following actions
Borrow $1
Purchase the underlying stock from the market for $1
Exercise the option i.e. sell the stock for $2
Repay $1
Did she do the right thing?
4. In an arbitrage-free market, consider the put option T = {P,$2,1}.
i) On expiry, how much should the option cost if the underlying stock costs $1?
ii) $3?
5. Consider the put option T = {P,$2,1}. On expiry the underlying stock costs $1. And the
option T is on sale for $0.5. Jenny immediately sees an arbitrage oppoturnity. Detail the actions
she should take to capitalise on the arbitrage oppoturnity. (Hint: immitate the Action, Money,
Balance table )
Pricing an option
Consider this hypothetical situation where a company, MassiveSoft, is in negatiation to merge
with another company, Pears. The share price of MassiveSoft currently stands at $7. If the
negotiation is successful, the share price will rise to $11; otherwise it will fall to $5. Experts
predict the probability of a success is 90%. Consider a call option that lets you buy 1000 shares
of MassiveSoft at $8 when the negotiation is finalised. How much should the option be?
Since the market is arbitrage-free, the value of the option at expiry is already determined. Of
course
if the negotiation is successful, the option is valued at (11 - 8) × 1000 = $3000
otherwise, the option should be worthless ($0)

148
the above are the only correct values of the option at expiry or people can "rip you off".

149
Let x be the price of the option at present, we can use the following diagrams to illustrate the
situation,
the diagram shows that the current price of the option should be $x, and if the negotiation is
successful, it will be worth $3000, otherwise it is worthless. In similar fashion, the following
diagram shows the value of the company stock now, and in the future
You may have notice that we didn't put down the probability of success or failure. Interestingly
(and counter-intuitively), they don't matter! Again, the arbitrage-free principle dictates that
what we have in the two diagrams above are sufficient for us to price the option!
How?
What is the option? It is the contract that gives you the option to buy ... Wait, wait, wait. Think
of it from another angle
it is a tradable object that is worth $2000 if the negotiation is successful, and $0 if otherwise
This is the main idea behind how to price the option. The option must be the same price as
another object that goes up to $2000 or down to $0 depending on the success of the negotiation.
Hopefully, this object is something we know the price of. This idea is called constructing a
replicating portfolio.
A portfolio is a collection of tradable things. We want to construct a portfolio that behaves in
the same way as the option. It turns out that we can construst a portfolio that behaves in the
way as the option by using only two things. They are
12. 
MassiveSoft shares
13. 
and money
let's assume that money is tradable in the sense that you can buy a dollar with a dollar. This
concept may seem very unintuitive at first. However let's proceed with the mathematics,
suppose this porfolio consists of y units of MassiveSoft shares and z units of money. If the
negotiation is successful, then each share will be worth $9, and the whole portolio should be

150
worth $2000, as it behaves in the same way as the option, so we have the following
but if the negotiation is unsuccessful then the portfolio is worthless ($0) and MassiveSoft share
prices will fall to $5, giving
we can easily solve the above simultaneous equations. We get
and so
y = 500 and z = − $2500
So this portolio consists of 500 MassiveSoft shares and -$2500. But what is -$2500? This can
be understood as an obligation to pay back some money (e.g. from borrowings) on the expiry
date of the option. So the porfolio we constructed can be thought of as
500 MassiveSoft shares and an obligation to pay $2500
Now, 500 MassiveSoft shares costs $7 × 500 = 3500, so the option should be priced as 3500 -
2500 = $1000.
Let's price a few more options.

pioneering work in portfolio theory with equivalent functions.

Matrices
Introduction
A matrix may be more popularly known as a giant computer simulation, but in mathematics it
is a totally different thing. To be more precise, a matrix (plural matrices) is an array of
numbers. For example, below is a typical way to write a matrix, with numbers arranged in rows
and column and with round brackets around the numbers
The above matrix has 4 rows and 4 columns, so we call it a 4 × 4 (4 by 4) matrix. Also, we can
have matrices of many different shapes. The shape of a matrix is the name for the dimensions
of matrix (m by n, where m is the number of rows and n the number of columns). Here are
some more examples of matrices
This is an example of a 3 × 3 matrix:
This is an example of a 5 × 4 matrix:
This is an example of a 1 × 6 matrix:
The theory of matrices is intimately connected with that of (linear) simultaneous equations. The
ancient Chinese had established a systematic way to solve simultaneous equations. The theory
of simultaneous equations is furthered in the east by the Japanese mathematician, Seki and a
little later by Leibniz, Newton's greatest rival. Later, Gauss (1777 - 1855), one of the three

152
pillars of modern mathematics popularised the use of Gaussian elimination, which is a simple
step by step algorithm for solving any number of linear simultaneous equations. By then the use
of matrices to represent simultaneous equation neatly on paper (as discussed above) has
become quite common[1].
Consider the simultaneous equations:
x + y = 10
x - y = 4
it has the solution x = 7 and y = 3, and the usual way to solve it is to add the two equations
together to eliminate the y. Matrix theory offers us another way to solve the above simultaneous
equations via matrix multiplication (covered below). We will study the widely accepted way to
multiply two matrices together. In theory with matrix multiplication we can solve any number
of simultaneous equations, but we shall mainly restrict our attention to 2 × 2 matrices. But even
with that restriction, we have opened up doors to topics simultaneous equations could never
offer us. Two such examples are
9. 
using matrices to solve linear recurrence relations which can be used to model population
growth, and
10. 
encrypting messages wtih matrices.
We shall commence our study by learning some of the more fundamental concepts of matrices.
Once we have a firm grasp of the basics, we shall move on to study the real meat of this
chapter, matrix multiplication.
Elements
An element of a matrix is a particular number inside the matrix, and it is uniquely located with
a pair of numbers. E.g. let the following matrix be denoted by A, or symbolically:
the (2,2)th entry of A is 5; the (1,1)th entry of A is 1, the (3,3) entry of A is 9 and the (3,2)th
entry of A is 8. The (i , j)th entry of A is usually denoted ai,j and the (i , j)th entry of a matrix B
is usually denoted by bi,j and so on.
Summary
• A matrix is an array of numbers
• A m×n matrix has m rows and n columns

153
• The shape of a matrix is determined by its number of rows and columns
• The (i,j)th element of a matrix is located in ith row and jth column
Matrix addition & Multiplication by a scalar
Matrices can be added together. But only the matrices of the same shape can be added. This is
very natural. E.g.
then
Similarly matrices can be multiplied by a number, we call the number a scalar, this is to
distinguish it from a matrix. The reader need not worry about the definition here, just remember
that a scalar is just a number.
in this case the scalar value is 5. In general, when we do s × A , where s is a scalar and A a
matrix, we multiply each entry of A by s.
Matrix Multiplication
The widely accepted way to multiply two matrices together is definitely non-intuitive. As
mentioned above, multiplication can help with solving simultaneous equations. We will now

154
give a brief outline of how this can be done. Firstly, any system of linear simultaneous
equations can be written as a matrix of coefficients multiplied by a matrix of unknowns
equaling a matrix of results. This description may sound a little complicated, but in symbolic
form it is quite clear. The previous statement simply says that if A, x and b are matrices, then Ax
= b, can be used to represent some system of simultaneous equations. The beautiful thing about
matrix multiplications is that some matrices can have multiplicative inverses, that is we can
multiply both sides of the equation by A-1 to get x = A-1b, which effectively solves the
simultaneous equations.
The reader will surely come to understand matrix multiplication better as this chapter
progresses. For now we should consider the simplest case of matrix multiplication, multiplying
vectors. We will see a few examples and then we will explain process of multiplication
then
Similarly if:
then
A matrix with just one row is called a row vector, similarly a matrix with just one column is
called a column vector. When we multiply a row vector A, with a column vector B, we multiply
the element in the first column of A by the element in the first row of B and add to that the
product of the second column of A and second row of B and so on. More generally we multiply
a1,i by bi,1 (where i ranges from 1 to n, the number of rows/columns) and sum up all of the
products. Symbolically:
(for information on the 
sign, see Summation_Sign)

155
where n is the number of rows/columns.
In words: the product of a column vector and a row vector is the sum of the product of item 1,i
from the row vector and i,1 from the column vector where i is from 1 to the width/height of
these vectors.
Note: The product of matrices is also a matrix. The product of a row vector and column vector
is a 1 by 1 matrix, not a scalar.

Diagonal matrices
A diagonal matrix is a matrix with zero entries everywhere except possibly down the diagonal.
Multiplying diagonal matrices is really convenient, as you need only to multiply the diagonal
entries together.

following

The above examples show that if D is a diagonal matrix then Dk is very easy to compute, all we
need to do is to take the diagonal entries to the kth power. This will be an extremely useful fact
later on, when we learn how to compute the nth Fibonacci number using matrices.

What do you notice?
The Identity & multiplication laws
The exercise above showed us that the matrix:
is a very special. It is called the 2 by 2 identity matrix. An identity matrix is a square matrix,
whose diagonal entries are 1's and all other entries are zero. The identity matrix, I, has the
following very special properties
10. 
11. 
for all matrices A. We don't usually specify the shape of the identity because it's obvious from
the context, and in this chapter we will only deal with the 2 by 2 identity matrix. In the real
number system, the number 1 satisfies: r × 1 = r = 1 × r, so it's clear that the identity matrix is
analogous to "1".
Associativity, distributivity and (non)-commutativity
Matrix multiplication is a great deal different to the multiplication we know from multiplying
real numbers. So it is comforting to know that many of the laws the real numbers satisfy also
carries over to the matrix world. But with one big exception, in general AB ≠ BA.
Let A, B, and C be matrices. Associativity means
(AB)C = A(BC)
i.e. the order in which you multiply the matrices is unimportant, because the final result you get
is the same regardless of the order which you do the multiplications.
On the other hand, distributivity means
A(B + C) = AB + AC

162
and
(A + B)C = AC + BC
Note: The commutative property of the real numbers (i.e. ab = ba), does not carry over to the
matrix world.
Convince yourself
For all 2 by 2 matrices A, B and C. And I the identity matrix.
1. Convince yourself that in the 2 by 2 case:
A(B + C) = AB + AC
and
(A + B)C = AC + BC
2. Convince yourself that in the 2 by 2 case:
A(BC) = (AB)C
3. Convince yourself that:
in general. When does AB = BA? Name at least one case.
Note that all of the above are true for all matrices (of any dimension/shape).
Determinant and Inverses
We shall consider the simultaneous equations:
ax + by = α (1)
cx + dy = β (2)
where a, b, c, d, α and β are constants. We want to determine the necessary conditions for (1)
and (2) to have a unique solution for x and y. We proceed:
Let (1') = (1) × c
Let (2') = (2) × a
i.e.
acx + bcy = cα (1')
acx + ady = aβ (2')

163
Now
let (3) = (2') - (1')
(ad - bc)y = aβ - cα (3)
Now y can be uniquely determined if and only if (ad - bc) ≠ 0. So the necessary condition for
(1) and (2) to have a unique solution depends on all four of the coefficients of x and y. We call
this number (ad - bc) the determinant, because it tells us whether there is a unique solutions to
two simultaneous equations of 2 variables. In summary
if (ad - bc) = 0 then there is no unique solution
if (ad - bc) ≠ 0 then there is a unique solution.
Note: Unique, we can not emphasise this word enough. If the determinant is zero, it doesn't
necessarily mean that there is no solution to the simultaneous equations! Consider:
x + y = 2
7x + 7y = 14
the above set of equations has determinant zero, but there is obviously a solution, namely x = y
= 1. In fact there are infiinitely many solutions! On the other hand consider also:
x + y = 1
x + y = 2
this set of equations has determinant zero, and there is no solution at all. So if determinant is
zero then there is either no solution or infinitely many solutions.
Determinant of a matrix
We define the determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix
to be
Inverses
It is perhaps, at this stage, not very clear what's the use of the det(A). But it's intimately
connected with the idea of an inverse. Consider in the real number system a number b, it has
(multiplicative) inverse 1/b, i.e. b(1/b) = (1/b)b = 1. We know that 1/b does not exist when b =
0.

164
In the world of matrices, a matrix A may or may not have an inverse depending on the value of
the determinant det(A)! How is this so? Let's suppose A (known) does have an inverse B (i.e.
AB = I = BA). So we aim to find B. Let's suppose further that
and
we need to solve four simultaneous equations to get the values of w, x, y and z in terms of a, b,
c, d and det(A).
aw + by = 1
cw + dy = 0
ax + bz = 0
cx + dz = 1
the reader can try to solve the above by him/herself. The required answer is
In here we assumed that A has an inverse, but this doesn't make sense if det(A) = 0, as we can
not divide by zero. So A-1 (the inverse of A) exists if and only if det(A) ≠ 0.
Summary
If AB = BA = I, then we say B is the inverse of A. We denote the inverse of A by A-1. The
inverse of a 2 × 2 matrix
is
provided the determinant of A, det(A) is zero.

165
Solving simultaneous equations
Suppose we are to solve:
ax + by = α
cx + dy = β
We let
we can translate it into matrix form
i.e
Aw = γ
If A's determinant is not zero, then we can pre-multiply both sides by A-1 (the inverse of A)
i.e.
which implies that x and y are unique.

Further Modular Arithmetic
In this chapter we assume the reader can find inverses and be able to solve a system of
congruences (Chinese Remainder Theorem) (see: Primes and Modular Arithmetic).
Introduction
Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics. --
Carl Friedrich Gauss 1777 - 1855
In the Primes and Modular Arithmetic section, we discussed the elementary properties of a
prime and its connection to modular arithmetic. Our attention has been, for the most part,
restricted to arithmetic mod p, where p is prime. But this need not be.
In this chapter, we will start by discussing some more elementary results in arithmetic modulo
p, and then we will move on to discuss those results modulo m where m is composite. In
particular, we will take a closer look at the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and how it allows us
to break arithmetic modulo m into components. From that point of view, the CRT is an
extremely powerful tool that can help us unlock the many secrets of modulo arithmetic (with
relative ease).
Lastly, we will introduce the idea of an abelian group through multiplication in modular
arithmetic and discuss the discrete log problem which underpins one of the most important
cryptographic systems known today.
Wilson's Theorem
Wilson's theorem is a simple result that leads to a number of interesting observations in
elementary number theory. It states that, if p is prime then
We know the inverse of p - 1 is p - 1, so each other number can be paired up by its inverse and
eliminated. For example, let p = 7, we consider
1 × 2 × .. × 6 ≡ (2 × 4) × (3 × 5) × 1 × 6 = 6
What we have done is that we paired up numbers that are inverses of each other, then we are
left with numbers whose inverse is itself. It this case, they are 1 and 6.
But there is a technical difficulty. For a general prime number, p, how do we know that 1 and p
- 1 are the only numbers in mod p which when squared give 1? For m not a prime, there are
more than 2 solutions to x2 ≡1 (mod m), for example, let m = 15, then x = 1, 14, 4, 11 are
solutions to x2 ≡1 (mod m).
We can not say Wilson's theorem is true, unless we show that there can only be (at most) two

181
solutions to x2 ≡1 (mod p) when p is prime. We shall overcome this final hurdle by a simple
proof by contradiction argument. You may want to skip the following proof and come up with
your own justification of why Wilson's theorem is true.
Let p be a prime, and x2 ≡1 (mod p). We aim to prove that there can only be 2 solutions,
namely x = 1, -1
it obvious from the above that x = 1, -1 (≡p - 1) are solutions. Suppose there is another solution,
x = d, and d not equal to 1 or -1. Since p is prime, we know d - 1 must have an inverse. We
substitute x with d and multiply both sides by the inverse, i.e.
but we our initial assumption was that d ≠ -1. This is a contradiction. Therefore there can only
be 2 solutions to x2 ≡1 (mod p).
Fermat's little Theorem
There is a remarkable little theorem named after Fermat, the prince of amateur mathematicians.
It states that if p is prime and given a ≠ 0 then
This theorem hinges on the fact that p is prime. It won't work otherwise. How so? Recall that if
p is prime then a ≠ 0 has an inverse. So for any b and c we must have
if and only if 
A simple consequence of the above is that the following numbers must all be different mod p
a, 2a , 3a, 4a, ..., (p-1)a
and there are p - 1 of these numbers! Therefore the above list is just the numbers 1, 2, ... p - 1 in
a different order. Let's see an example, take p = 5, and a = 2:
1, 2, 3, 4
multiply each of the above by 2 in mod 5, we get
2, 4, 1, 3

182
They are just the original numbers in a different order.
So for any p and using Wilson's Theorem (recall: 1 × 2 × ... × (p-1) ≡ -1),
, we get
on the other hand we also get
Equating the two results, we get
which is essentially Fermat's little theorem.
Modular Arithmetic with a general m
*Chinese Remainder Theorem revisited*
This section is rather theoretical, and is aimed at justifying the arithmetic we will cover in the
next section. Therefore it is not necessary to fully understand the material here, and the reader
may safely choose to skip the material below.
Recall the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) we covered in the Modular Arithmetic section.
In states that the following congruences
have a solution if and only if gcd(n1,n2) divides (b - c).
This deceptively simple theorem holds the key to arithmetic modulo m (not prime)! We shall
consider the case where m has only two prime factors, and then the general case shall follow.
Suppose m = piqj, where p and q are distinct primes, then every natural number below m (0, 1,
2, ..., m - 1) corresponds uniquely to a system of congruence mod pi and mod qj. This is due to
the fact that gcd(pi,qj) = 1, so it divides all numbers.
Consider a number n, it corresponds to

183
for some xn and yn. If r ≠ n then r corresponds to
Now since r and n are different, we must have either xr ≠ xn and/or yr ≠ yn
For example take 
, then we can construct the following table showing the
xn, yn for each n (0, 1, 2 ... 11)

Arithmetic with CRT
Exercise 2 above gave the biggest indication yet as to how the CRT can help with arithmetic
modulo m. It is not essential for the reader to fully understand the above at this stage. We will
proceed to describe how CRT can help with arithmetic modulo m. In simple terms, the CRT
helps to break a modulo-m calculation into smaller calculations modulo prime factors of m. We

185
will see what we mean very soon.
As always, let's consider a simple example first. Let 
and we see that m
has two distinct prime factors. We should demonstrate multiplication of 51 and 13 modulo 63
in two ways. Firstly, the standard way
Alternatively, we notice that
and
We can represent the two expressions above as a two-tuple (6,2). We abuse the notation a little
by writing 51 = (6,2). Similarly, we write 13 = (4,6). When we do multiplication with two-
tuples, we multiply component-wise, i.e. (a,b) Ã- (c,d) = (ac,bd),
Now let's solve
and
we write x = 6 + 9a, which is the first congruence equation, and then

186
therefore we have a = 3 + 7b, substitute back to get
which is the same answer we got from multiplying 51 and 13 (mod 63) the standard way!
Let's summarise what we did. By representing the two numbers (51 and 13) as two two-tuples
and multiplying component-wise, we ended up with another two-tuple. And this two-tuple
corresponds to the product of the two numbers (mod m) via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
We will do two more examples. Let 
, and lets multiply 66 and 40 in two
ways. Firstly, the standard way
and now the second way, 40 = (0,7) and 66 = (4,0) and
For the second example, we notice that there is no need to stop at just two distinct prime
factors. We let 
, and multiply 900 and 647 (mod 975),
For the other way, we note that 900 ≡ 0 (mod 3) ≡ 0 (mod 25) ≡ 3 (mod 13), and for 647 ≡ 2
(mod 3) ≡ 22 (mod 25) ≡ 10 (mod 13),
now if we solve the following congruences

187
then we will get x ≡ 225!
Why? If anything, breaking modular arithmetic in m into smaller components seems to be quite
a bit of work. Take the example of multiplications, firstly, we need to express each number as a
n-tuple (n is the number of distinct prime factors of m), multiply component-wise and then
solve the resultant n congruences. Surely, it must be more complicated than just multiplying the
two numbers and then reduce the result modulo m. So why bother studying it at all?
By breaking a number m into prime factors, we have gained insight into how the arithmetic
really works. More importantly, many problems in modular m can be difficult to solve, but
when broken into components it suddenly becomes quite easy, e.g. Wilson's Theorem for a
general m (discussed below).
Exercises
1. Show that addition can also be done component-wise.
2. Multiply component-wise 32 and 84 (mod 134).

Euler totient
To discuss the more general form of Wilson's Theorem and Fermat's Little Theorem in mod m
(not prime), it's nice to know a simple result from the famous mathematician Euler. More
specifically, we want to discuss a function, called the Euler totient function (or Euler Phi),
denoted ϕ.
The ϕ functions does a very simple thing. For any natural number m, ϕ(m) gives the number of
n < m, such that gcd(n,m) = 1. In other words, it calculates how many numbers in mod m have
an inverse. We will discuss the value of ϕ (m) for simple cases first and then derive the formula
for a general m from the basic results.
For example, let m = 5, then ϕ (m) = 4. As 5 is prime, all non-zero natural numbers below 5
(1,2,3 and 4) are coprimes to it. So there are 4 numbers in mod 5 that have inverses. In fact, if
m is prime then ϕ (m) = m - 1.
We can generalise the above to m = pr where p is prime. In this case, we try to employ a
counting argument to calculate ϕ (m). Note that there are pr natural numbers below m (0, 1, 2 ...
pr - 1), and so ϕ (m) = pr - (number of n < m such that gcd(n,m) ≠ 1). We did that because it is
easier to count the number of n 's without an inverse mod m.
An element, n, in mod m does not have an inverse if and only if it shares a common factor with

188
m. But all factors of m (not equal to 1) are a multiple of p. So how many multiples of p are
there in mod m? We can list them, they are

189
where the last element can be written as (pr-1 - 1)p, and so there are 
multiples of p.
Therefore we can conclude
We now have all the machinery necessary to derive the formula of ϕ (m) for any m.
By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, any natural number m can be uniquely expressed
as the product of primes, that is
where pi for i = 1, 2 ... r are distinct primes and ki are positive integers. For example 1225275 =
3Ã-52Ã-17Ã-312. From here, the reader should try to derive the following result (the CRT may
help).
Euler totient function ϕϕϕϕ
Suppose m can be uniquely expressed as below
  
then
  
Wilson's Theorem
Wilson's Theorem for a general m states that the product of all the invertible element in mod m
equals -1 if m has only one prime factor, or m = 2pk for some prime p
equals 1 for all other cases
An invertible element of mod m is a natural number n < m such that gcd(n, m) = 1. A self-
invertible element is an element whose inverse is itself.
In the proof of Wilson's Theorem for a prime p, the numbers 1 to p - 1 all have inverses. This is
not true for a general m. In fact it is certain that (m - 1)! ≡0 (mod m), for this reason we instead
consider the product of all invertible elements in mod m.
For the case where m = p is prime we also appealed to the fact 1 and p - 1 are the only elements
when squared gives 1. In fact for m = pk, 1 and m - 1 (≡-1)are the only self-invertible elements
(see exercise). But for a general m, this is not true. Let's take for example m = 21. In arithmetic
modulo 21 each of the following numbers has itself as an inverse
1, 20, 8, 13
so how can we say the product of all invertible elements equal to 1?
We use the CRT described above. Let us consider the case where m = 2pk. By the CRT, each

190
element in mod m can be represented as a two tuple (a,b) where a can take the value 0 or 1
while b can take the value 0, 1, ..., or pk - 1. Each two tuple corresponds uniquely to a pair of
congruence equations and multiplication can be performed component-wise.
Using the above information, we can easily list all the self-invertible elements, because (a,b)2
≡1 means (a2,b2) = (1,1), so a is an invertible element in mod 2 and b is an invertible element in
mod pk, so a ≡1 or -1, b ≡1 or -1. But in mod 2 1 ≡-1, so a = 1. Therefore, there are two
elements that are self invertible in mod m = 2pk, they are (1,1) = 1, and (1, -1) = m - 1 . So in
this case, the result is the same as when m has only a single prime factor.
For the case where m has more than one prime factors and m≠ 2pk. Let say m has n prime
factors then m can be represented as a n-tuple. Let say m has 3 distinct prime factors, then all
the self-invertible elements of m are
14. 
(1,1,1)
15. 
(1,1,-1)
16. 
(1,-1,1)
17. 
(1,-1,-1)
18. 
(-1,1,1)
19. 
(-1,1,-1)
20. 
(-1,-1,1)
21. 
(-1,-1,-1)
their product is (1,1,1) which corresponds to 1 in mod m.
Exercise
1. Let p be a prime. Show that in arithmetic modulo pk, 1 and pk - 1 are the only self-invertible
elements.

Fermat's Little Theorem
As mentioned in the previous section, not every element is invertible (i.e. has an inverse) mod
m. A generalised version of Fermat's Last Theorem uses Euler's Totient function, it states
for all a ≠ 0 satisfying gcd(a,m) = 1. This is easy to see from the generalised version of
Wilson's Theorem. We use a similar techique from the prove of Fermat's Little Theorem. We
have
where the bi's are all the invertible elements mod m. By Wilson's theorem the product of all the
invertible elements equals to, say, d (= 1 or -1). So we get
whihc is essentially the statement of Fermat's Little Theorem.
Although the FLT is very neat, it is imprecise in some sense. For example take m = 15 = 3 Ã- 5,
we know that if a has an inverse mod 15 then aϕ(15) = a8 ≡1 (mod 15). But 8 is too large, all we
need is 4, by that we mean, a4 ≡1 (mod 15) for all a with an inverse (the reader can check).
The Carmichael function Î»(m) is the smallest number such that aÎ»(m) ≡1 (mod m). A question
in the Problem Set deals with this function.

Two-torsion Factorisation
It it quite clear that factorising a large number can be extremely difficult. For example, given
that 76372591715434667 is the product of two primes, can the reader factorise it? Without the
help of a good computer algebra software, the task is close to being impossible. As of today,
there is no known efficient all purpose algorithm for factorising a number into prime factors.
However, under certain special circumstances, factorising can be easy. We shall consider the
two-torsion factorisation method. A 2-torsion element in modular m arithmetic is a number a
such that a2 ≡1 (mod m).
Let's consider an example in arithmetic modulo 21. Note that using the CRT we can represent
any number in mod 21 as a two-tuple. We note that the two-torsion elements are 1 = (1,1), 13 =
(1,-1), 8 = (-1,1) and 20 = (-1,-1). Of interest are the numbers 13 and 8, because 13 + 1 = (1,-1)

192
+ (1,1) = (2,0). Therefore 13 + 1 = 14 is an element sharing a common factor with 21, as the
second component in the two-tuple representation of 14 is zero. Therefore GCD(14,21) = 7 is a
factor of 21.
The above example is very silly because anyone can factorise 21. But what about 24131?
Factorising it is not so easy. But, if we are given that 12271 is a non-trivial (i.e. ≠ 1 or -1) two-
torsion element, then we can conclude that both gcd(12271 + 1,24131) and gcd(12271 -
1,24131) are factors of 24131. Indeed gcd(12272,24131) = 59 and gcd(12270,24131) = 409 are
both factors of 24131.
More generally, let m be a composite, and t be a non-trivial two-torsion element mod m i.e. t ≠
1, -1. Then
gcd(t + 1,m) divides m, and
gdc(t - 1,m) divides m
this can be explained using the CRT.
We shall explain the case where m = pq and p and q are primes. Given t is a non-trivial two-
torsion element, then t has representaion (1,-1) or (-1,1). Suppose t = (-1,1) then t + 1 = (-1,1) +
(1,1) = (0,2), therefore t + 1 must be a multiple of p therefore gcd(t,m) = p. In the other case
where t - 1 = (-1,1) - (1,1) = (-2,0) and so gcd(t - 1,m) = q.
So if we are given a non-trivial two-torsion element then we have effectively found one (and
possibly more) prime factors, which goes a long way in factorising the number. In most modern
public key cryptography applications, to break the system we need only to factorise a number
with two prime factors. In that regard two-torsion factorisation method is frightening
effectively.
Of course, finding a non-trivial two-torsion element is not an easy task either. So internet
banking is still safe for the moment. By the way 76372591715434667 = 224364191 Ã-
340395637.

Mathematical programming
Before we begin
This chapter will not attempt to teach you how to program rigorously. Therefore a basic
working knowledge of the C programming language is highly recommended. It is
recommended that you learn as much about the C programming language as possible before
learning the materials in this chapter.
Please read the first 7 lessons of "C Programming Tutorial" by About.com
http://cplus.about.com/library/blctut.htm
if you are unfamiliar with programming or the C programming language.
Introduction to programming
Programming has many uses. Some areas where programming and computer science in general
are extremely important include artificial intelligence and statistics. Programming allows you to
use computers flexibly and process data very quickly.
When a program is written, it is written into a textual form that a human can understand.
However, a computer doesn't directly understand what a human writes. It needs to be
transformed into a way that the computer can directly understand.
For example, a computer is like a person who reads and speaks German. You write and speak
in English. The letter you write to the computer needs to be translated for the computer to
speak. The program responsible for this work is referred to as the compiler.
You need to compile your English-like instructions, so that the computer can understand it.
Once a program has been compiled, it is hard to "un-compile" it, or transform it back into
English again. A programmer writes the program (to use our analogy, in English), called source
code, which is a human-readable definition of the program, and then the compiler translates this
into "machine code". We recommend using the widely available gcc compiler.
When we look at mathematical programming here, we will look at how we can write programs
that will solve some difficult mathematical problems that would take us normally a lot of time
to solve. For example, if we wanted to find an approximation to the root of the polynomial
x5+x+1 - this is very difficult for a human to solve. However a computer can do this no sweat --
how?

Discrete Programming
Discrete programming deals with integers and how they are manipulated using the computer.
Understanding integral division
In C, the command
int number;
number = 3 / 2;
will set aside some space in the computer memory, and we can refer to that space by the
variable name number. In the computer's mind, number is an integer, nothing else. After
number = 3 / 2;
numbers equals 1, not 1.5, this is due to that fact that / when applied to two integers will give
only the integral part of the result. For example:
5 / 2 equals 2
353 / 3 equals 117
99 / 7 equals 14
-19 / 2 equals -9
78 / -3 equals -29
in C.
Exercises Evaluate x
a) x = 7 / 2
b) x = -9 / -4
c) x = 1000 / 999
d) x = 2500 / 2501
Modelling Recursively defined functions
The factorial function n! is recursively defined:
0! = 1
n! = nÃ-(n-1)! if n ≠¥ 1

195
In C, if fact(n) is the functions as described above we want
fact(0) = 1;
fact(n) = n * fact(n âˆ’ 1); if 
we should note that all recursively defined functions have a terminating condition, it is the case
where the function can give a direct answer to, e.g. fact(0) = 1.
We can model the factorial functions easily with the following code and then execute it:
int fact (int n)
{
if (n == 0)
return 1;
if (n >= 1)
return n * fact(n - 1);
}
The C function above models the factorial function very naturally. To test the results, we can
compile the following code:
#include <stdio.h> /* STanDard Input & Output Header file */
int fact (int n)
{
if (n == 0)
return 1;
if (n >= 1)
return n * fact(n - 1);
}
void main()
{
int n = 5;
printf("%d", fact(n)); /* printf is defined in stdio.h */

196
}
We can also model the Fibonacci number function. Let fib(n) return the (n + 1)th Fibonacci
number, the following should be clear
fib(0) should return 1
fib(1) should return 1
fib(n) should return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); for n ≥ 2
we can model the above using C:
int fib (int n)
{
if (n == 0 || n == 1) /* if n = 0 or if n = 1 */
return 1;
if (n >= 2)
return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
Again, you shall see that modelling a recursive function is not hard, as it only involves
translating the mathematics in C code.
Modelling non-recursive functions
There are functions that involve only integers, and they can be modelled quite nicely using
functions in C. The factorial function
f(n) = n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... 3Ã-2Ã-1
can be modelled quite simply using the following code
int n = 10;  //get factorial for 10
int f = 1;   //start f at 1
while(n > 0) //keep looping if n bigger then 0
{
   f = n * f; //f is now product of f and n
   n = n - 1; //n is one less (repeat loop)
}

Basic counting
Counting
All supplementary chapters contain materials that are part of the standard high school
mathematics curriculum, therefore the material is only provided for completeness and
should mostly serve as revision.
Ordered Selection
Suppose there are 20 songs in your mp3 collection. The computer is asked to randomly selected
10 songs and play them in the order they are selected, how many ways are there to select the 10
songs? This type of problems is called ordered selection counting, as the order in which the
things are selected is important. E.g. if one selection is
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10
then
2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10
is considered a different selection.
There are 20 ways to choose the first song since there are 20 songs, then there are 19 ways to
choose the second song and 18 ways to choose the third song ... and so on. Therefore the total
number of ways can be calculated by considering the following product:
20 Ã- 19 Ã- 18 Ã- 17 Ã- 16 Ã- 15 Ã- 14 Ã- 13 Ã- 12 Ã- 11
or denoted more compactly:
Here we use the factorial function, defined by 0! = 1 and 
. (In other
words, 
)
In general, the number of ordered selections of m items out of n items is:
The idea is that we cancel off all but the first m factors of the n! product.

199
Unordered Selection
Out of the 15 people in your mathematics class, five will be chosen to represent the class in a
school wide mathematics competition. How many ways are there to choose the five students?
This problem is called an unordered selection problem, i.e. the order in which you select the
students is not important. E.g. if one selection is
Joe, Lee, Sue, Britney, Justin
another selection is
Lee, Joe, Sue, Justin, Britney
the two selections are considered equivalent.
There are
ways to choose the 5 candidates in ordered selection, but there are 5! permutations of the same
five candidates. (That is, 5! different permutations are actually the same combination).
Therefore there are
ways of choosing 5 students to represent your class.
In general, to choose (unordered selection) m candidates from n, there are
ways. We took the formula for ordered selections of m candidates from n, and then divided by
m! because each unordered selection was counted as m! ordered selections.
Note: 
is read "n choose m".
Examples
Example 1 How many different ways can the letters of the word BOOK be arranged?
Solution 1 4! ways if the letters are all distinct. Since O is repeated twice, there are 2!
permutations. Therefore there are 4!/2! = 12 ways.

200
Example 2 How many ways are there to choose 5 diamonds from a deck of cards?
Solution 2 There are 13 diamonds in the deck. So there are 
ways.
Binomial expansion
The binomial expansion deals with the expansion of following expression
(a + b)n
Take n = 3 for example, we shall try to expand the expression manually we get
(a + b)3
= (aa + ab + ba + bb)(a + b)
= aaa + aab + aba + abb + baa + bab + bba + bbb
= aaa + aab + aba + abb + baa + bab + bba + bbb
We deliberately did not simplify the expression at any point during the expansion, we didn't
even use the well known (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2. As you can see, the final expanded form has 8
terms. They are all the possible terms of powers of a and b with three factors!
Since there are 3 factors in each term and all the possibles terms are in the expanded
expressoin. How many terms are there with only one b? The answer should be 
, i.e. from
3 possible positions, choose 1 for b. Similarly we can work out all the coefficient of like-terms.
So
(a + b)3
And more generally
(a + b)n
or more compactly using the summation sign (otherwise known as sigma notation)

Method of Partial Fractions
All supplementary chapters contain materials that are part of the standard high school
mathematics curriculum, therefore the material is only provided for completeness and
should mostly serve as revision.
Introduction
Before we begin, consider the following: 
How do we calculate this sum? At first glance it may seem difficult, but if you think carefully
you will find: 
Thus the original problem can be rewritten as follows,
So all terms except the first and the last cancelled out, and therefore
In fact, you've just done partial fractions! Partial fractions is a method of breaking down
complex fractions that involve products into sums of simpler fractions.

respectively.

204
More on partial fraction
Repeated factors
On the last section we have talked about factorizing the denominator, and have each factor as
the denominators of each term. But what happens when there are repeating factors? Can we
apply the same method? See the example below:
Indeed, a factor is missing! Can we multiply both the denominator and the numerator by that
factor? No! Because the numerator is of degree 1, multiplying with a linear factor will make it
become degree 2! (You may think:can't we set A+B+C=0? Yes, but by substituting A+B=-C,
you will find out that this is impossible)
From the above failed example, we see that the old method of partial fraction seems not to be
working. You may ask, can we actually break it down? Yes, but before we finally attack this
problem, let's look at the denominators at more detail.
Consider 
the 
following 
example:
We can see that the power of a prime factor in the product denominator is the maximum power
of that prime factor in all term's denominator.
Similarly, let there be factor P1,P2,...,Pn, then we may have in general case:

205
If 
we 
turn 
it 
into 
one 
big 
fraction, 
the 
denominator 
will 
be:
Back to our example, since the factor (x+2) has a power of 2, at least one of the term has (x +
2)2 as the denominator's factor. You may then try as follows:
But again, we can't set B=0, since that would means the latter term is 0! What is missing? To
handle it properly, let's use a table to show all possible combinations of the denominator:
Possible combinations of denominator
 Power of (x+2)
Power of (x-1)

So, we now know that X/(x+2) is missing, we can finally happily get the answer:
Therefore by matching coefficient of like power of x, we have
As a conclusion, for a repeated factor of power n, we will have n terms with their denominator
being X^n, X^(n-1), ...,X^2, X
Works continuing, don't distrub :)
Alternate method for repeated factors
Other than the method suggested above, we would like to use another approach to handle the
problem. We first leave out some factor to make it into non-repeated form, do partial fraction
on it, then multiply the factor back, then apply partial fraction on the 2 fractions.

208
Then we do partial fraction on the latter part:
By matching coefficients of like powers of x, we have
Substitute A=4-B into (2),
   2B − (4 − B) = − 1
Hence B = 1 and A = 3.
We carry on:

209
Now we do partial fraction once more:
By matching coefficients of like powers of x , we have:
Substitute A=-B into (2), we have:
2B-(-B) = 1
Hence B=1/3 and A=-1/3
So finally,

Summation sign
Summation Notation
All supplementary chapters contain materials that are part of the standard high school
mathematics curriculum, therefore the material is only provided for completeness and
should mostly serve as revision.
We normally use the "+" sign to represent a sum, but if the sum expression involved is complex
and long, it can be confusing.
For example:
Writing the above would be a tedious and messy task!
To represent expression of this kind more compactly and nicely, people use the summation
notation, a capital greek letter "Sigma". On the right of the sigma sign people write the
expression of each term to sum, and write the upper and lower limit of the variable on top and
under the sigma sign.
Example 
1: 
Misconception: From the above there is a common misconception that the number on top of the Sigma
sign is the number of terms. This is wrong. The number on top is the number to subsitute back in the
last term.
Example

Complex numbers
Introduction
All supplementary chapters contain materials that are part of the standard high school
mathematics curriculum, therefore the material is only provided for completeness and
should mostly serve as revision.
Although the real numbers can, in some sense, represent any natural quantity, they are in
another sense incomplete. We can write certain types of equations with real number
coefficients which we desire to solve, but which have no real number solutions. The simplest
example of this is the equation:
Your high school math teacher may have told you that there is no solution to the above
equation. He/she may have even emphasised that there is no real solution. But we can, in fact,
extend our system of numbers to include the complex numbers by declaring the solution to that
equation to exist, and giving it a name: the imaginary unit, i.
Let's imagine for this chapter that 
exists. Hence x = i is a solution to the above
question, and i2 = - 1.
A valid question that one may ask is "Why?". Why is it important that we be able to solve these
quadratics with this seemingly artificial construction? It is interesting delve a little further into
the reason why this imaginary number was introduced in the first place - it turns out that there
was a valid reason why mathematicians realized that such a construct was useful, and could
provide deeper insight.
The answer to the question lies not in the solution of quadratics, but rather in the solution of the
intersection of a cubic and a line. The mathematician Cardano managed to come up with an
ingenious method of solving cubics - much like the quadratic formula, there is also a formula
that gives us the roots of cubic equations, although it is far more complicated. Essentially, we
can express the solution of a cubic x3 = 3px + 2q in the form
An unsightly expression, indeed!
You should be able to convince yourself that the line y = 3px + 2q must always hit the cubic y =
x3. But try solving some equation where q2 < p3, and you run into a problem - the problem is

214
that we are forced to deal with the square root of a negative number. But, we know that in fact
there is a solution for x; for example, x3 = 15x + 4 has the solution x = 4.
It became apparent to the mathematician Bombelli that there was some piece of the puzzle that
was missing - something that explained how this seemingly perverse operation of taking a
square root of a negative number would somehow simplify to a simple answer like 4. This was
in fact the motivation for considering imaginary numbers, and opened up a fascinating area of
mathematics.
The topic of Complex numbers is very much concerned with this number i. Since this number
doesn't exist in this real world, and only lives in our imagination, we call it the imaginary unit.
(Note that i is not typically chosen as a variable name for this reason.)
The imaginary unit
As mentioned above

Complex numbers as solutions to quadratic equations
Consider the quadratic equation:
The x we get as a solution is what we call a complex number. (To be nitpicky, the solution set
of this equation actually has two complex numbers in it; either is a valid value for x.) It consists
of two parts: a real part of 3 and an imaginary part of 
. Let's call the real part a and the
imaginary part b; then the sum 
is a complex number.
Notice that by merely defining the square root of negative one, we have already given ourselves
the ability to assign a value to a much more complicated, and previously unsolvable, quadratic
equation. It turns out that 'any' polynomial equation of degree n has exactly n zeroes if we
allow complex numbers; this is called the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
We denote the real part by Re. E.g.:

Arithmetic with complex numbers
Addition and multiplication
Adding and multiplying two complex number together turns out to be quite straightforward.
Let's illustrate with a few examples. Let x = 3 - 2i and y = 7 + 11i, and we do addition first
and now multiplication
Let's summarise the results here.
• When adding complex numbers we add the real parts with real parts, and add the imaginary
parts with imaginary parts.
• When multiplying two complex numbers together, we use normal expansion. Whenever we see
i2 we put in its place -1. We then collect like terms.
But how do we calculate:
Note that the square root is only above the 5 and not the i. This is a little bit tricky, and we shall

217
cover it in the next section.
Exercises:
Compute:
6. x + y
7. x - y
8. x2
9. y2
10. xy
11. (x + y)(x - y)
Division
One way to calculate:
is to rationalise the denominator:
Utilising a similar idea, to calculate
we realise the denominator.

218
The denominator is the sum of two squares. We get:
If somehow we can always find a complex number whose product with the denominator is a
real number, then it's easy to do divisions.
If
and
Then zw is a real number. This is true for any 'a' and 'b' (provided they are real numbers).
Exercises
Convince yourself that the product of zw is always a real number.
Complex Conjugate
The exercise above leads to the idea of a complext conjugate. The complex congugate of a + ib
is a - ib. For example, the conjugate of 2 + 3i is 2 - 3i. It is a simple fact that the product of a
complex number and its conjugate is always a real number. If z is a complex number then its
conjugate is denoted by 
. Symbolically if
z = a + ib
then,
The conjugate of 3 - 9i is 3 + 9i.
The conjugate of 100 is 100.
The conjugate of 9i - 20 is -20 - 9i.
Conjugate laws
Here are a few simple rules regarding the complex congugate

219
and
The above laws simply says that the sum of congugates equals the congugate of the sum; and
similarly, the congugate of the product equals the product of the congugates.
Consider this example:
(3 + 2i) + (89 âˆ’ 100i) = 92 âˆ’ 98i
and we can see that
which equals to
This confirms the addition conjugate law.
Exercise
Convince yourself that the multiplication law is also true.
The complex root
Now that you are equipped with all the basics of complex numbers, you can tackle the more
advanced topic of root finding.
Consider the question:
Express w in the form of a + ib.
That is easy enough.

220
Solve (1) and (2) simultaneously to work out a and b.
Observe that if, after solving for a and b, we replace them with -a and -b respectively, then they
would still satisfy the two simultaneous equations above, we can see that (as expected) if w = a
+ ib satisfies the equation w2 = z, then so will w = -(a + ib). With real numbers, we always take
the non-negative answer and call the solution 
. However, since there is no notion of
"greater than" or "less than" with complex numbers, there is no such choice of 
. In fact,
which square root to take as "the" value of 
depends on the circumstances, and this choice
is very important to some calculations.
info -- Finding the square root
Finding the root of a real number is a very difficult problem to start with. Most people have
no hope of finding a close estimate of 
without the help of a calculator. The modern
method of approximating roots involves an easy to understand and ingenius piece of
mathematics called the Taylor series expansion. The topic is usually covered in first year
university maths as it requires an elementary understanding of an important branch of
mathematics called calculus. The Newton-Raphson method of root finding is also used
extensively for this purpose.
Now consider the problem
Express w in the form of "a + ib".
Using the methodology developed above we proceed as follows,

221
It turns out that the simultaneous equations (1) & (2) are hard to solve. Actually, there is an
easy way to calculate the roots of complex numbers called the De Moivre's theorem, it allows
us to calculate the nth root of any complex number with ease. But to set the method, we need
understand the geometric meaning of a complex number and learn a new way to represent a
complex number.
Exercises

10. Find (1 + 1i)1/2
11. Find i1/3
The complex plane
Complex numbers as ordered pairs
It is worth noting, at this point, that every complex number, a + bi, can be completely specified
with exactly two real numbers: the real part a, and the imaginary part b. This is true of every
complex number; for example, the number 5 has real part 5 and imaginary part 0, while the
number 7i has real part 0 and imaginary part 7. We can take advantage of this to adopt an
alternative scheme for writing complex numbers: we can write them as ordered pairs, in the
form (a, b) instead of a+bi.

222
These should look familiar: they are exactly like the ordered pairs we use to represent poins in
the plane. In fact, we can use them that way; the plane which results is called the complex
plane. We refer to its x axis as the real axis, and to its y axis as the imaginary axis.

223
The complex plane
We can see from the above that a single complex number is a point in the complex plane. We
can also represent sets of complex numbers; these will form regions on the plane. For example,
the set
is a square of edge length 2 centered at the origin (See following diagram).
Complex-valued functions
Just as we can make functions which take real values and output real values, so we can create
functions from complex numbers to real numbers, or from complex numbers to complex
numbers. These latter functions are often referred to as complex-valued functions, because they
evaluate to (output) a complex number; it is implicit that their argument (input) is complex as
well.
Since complex-valued functions map complex numbers to other complex numbers, and we
have already seen that complex numbers correspond to points on the complex plane, we can see
that a complex-valued function can turn regions on the complex plane into other regions. A
simple example: the function
f(z) = z + (0 + 1i)
takes a point in the complex plane and shifts it up by 1. If we apply it to the set of points
making up the square above, it will move the entire square up one, so that it "rests" on the x-
axis.
{To make more complicated examples, I will first have to go back and introduce the polar
representation of complex numbers. Makes for much more interesting functions, :-) You can
use the diagrams below or modify them to make new diagrams. I will make links to these
diagrams in other places in Wikibooks:math. In the 2nd diagram showing the point, r=4 and

224
theta= 50 degrees. These types of diagrams can be used to introduce phasors, which are
notations for complex numbers used in electrical engineering.}
de Moivre's Theorem
If
z 
= 
reiÎ¸ 
= 
r(cos(Î¸) 
+ 
isin(Î¸))
then
zn = rn(cos(nÎ¸) + isin(nÎ¸))

225
Complex root of unity
The complex roots of unity to the nth degree is the set of solutions to the equation x^n = 1.
Clearly they all have magnitude 1. They form a cyclic group under multiplication. For any
given n, there are exactly n many of them, and they form a regular n-gon in the complex plane
over the unit circle.
A closed form solution can be given for them, by use of Euler's formula: u^n =
{cos(2*pi*j/n)+i*sin(2*pi*j/n) | 0 <= j < n}
The sum of the nth roots of unity is equal to 0, except for n=1, where it is equal to 1.
The product of the nth roots of unity alternates between -1 and 1.

possible bytes)

Differentiation
Differentiate from first principle
All supplementary chapters contain materials that are part of the standard high school
mathematics curriculum, therefore the material is only provided for completeness and
should mostly serve as revision. This section and the *differentiation technique* section can
be skipped if you are already familiar with calculus/differentiation.
In calculus, differentiation is a very important operation applied to functions of real numbers.
To differentiate a function f(x), we simply evaluate the limit
where the 
means that we let h approach 0. However, for now, we can simply think of it as
putting h to 0, i.e., letting h = 0 at an appropriate time. There are various notations for the result
of differentiation (called the derivative), for example
and
mean the same thing. We say, f'(x) is the derivative of f(x). Differentiation is useful for many
purposes, but we shall not discuss why calculus was invented, but rather how we can apply
calculus to the study of generating functions.
It should be clear that if
g(x) = f(x)
then
g'(x) = f'(x)
the above law is important. If g(x) a closed-form of f(x), then it is valid to differentiate both
sides to obtain a new generating function.
Also if
h(x) = g(x) + f(x)

234
then
h'(x) = g'(x) + f'(x)
This can be verified by looking at the properties of limits.
Example 1
Differentiate from first principle f(x) where
f(x) = x2
Firstly, we form the difference quotient
We can't set h to 0 to evaluate the limit at this point. Can you see why? We need to expand the
quadratic first.
We can now factor out the h to obtain now
from where we can let h go to zero safely to obtain the derivative, 2x. So
f'(x) = 2x
or equivalently:
(x2)' = 2x
Example 2
Differentiate from first principles, p(x) = xn.
We start from the difference quotient:
By the binomial theorem, we have:

235
The first xn cancels with the last, to get
Now, we bring the constant 1/h inside the brackets
and the result falls out:
= nxn - 1
Important Result
If
p(x) = xn
then
p'(x) = nxn - 1
As you can see, differentiate from first principle involves working out the derivative of a
function through algebraic manipulation, and for that reason this section is algebraically very
difficult.
Example 3
Assume that if
h(x) = f(x) + g(x)
then
h'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)
Differentiate x2 + x5
Solution Let h(x) = x2 + x5
h'(x) = 2x + 5x4
Example 4
Show that if g(x) = AÃ-f(x) then

236
g'(x) = AÃ-f'(x)

5. Prove the result assumed in example 3 above, i.e. if
f(x)=g(x)+h(x)
then
   f′(x)=g′(x)+h′(x).
Hint: use limits.
Differentiating f(z) = (1 - z)^n
We aim to derive a vital result in this section, namely, to derive the derivative of
f(z) = (1 - z)n
where n ≥ 1 and n an integer. We will show a number of ways to arrive at the result.
Derivation 1
Let's proceed:
f(z) = (1 - z)n
expand the right hand side using binomial expansion

238
differentiate both sides
now we use 
and there are some cancelling
take out a common factor of -n, and recall that 1! = 0! = 1 we get
let j = i - 1, we get
but this is just the expansion of (1 - z)n-1
f'(z) = - n(1 - z)n - 1
Derivation 2
Similar to Derivation 1, we use instead the definition of a derivative:
expand using the binomial theorem

239
factorise
take the limit inside (recall that [Af(x)]' = Af'(x) )
the inside is just the derivative of zi
exactly as derivation 1, we get
f'(z) = - n(1 - z)n - 1
Example Differentiate (1 - z)2
Solution 1
f(z) = (1 - z)2 = 1 - 2z + z2
f'(z) = - 2 + 2z
f'(z) = - 2(1 - z)
Solution 2 By the result derived above we have
f'(z) = -2(1 - z)2 - 1 = -2(1 - z)
Exercises
Imitate the method used above or otherwise, differentiate:
1. (1 - z)3
2. (1 + z)2
3. (1 + z)3
4. (Harder) 1/(1 - z)3 (Hint: Use definition of derivative)

240
Differentiation technique
We will teach how to differentiate functions of this form:
i.e. functions whose reciprocals are also functions. We proceed, by the definition of
differentiation:
Example 1
by
where g is a function of z, we get
which confirmed the result derived using a counting argument.

241
Exercises

1. 1/(1-z)2
2. 1/(1-z)3
3. 1/(1+z)3
4. Show that (1/(1 - z)n)' = n/(1-z)n+1
Differentiation applied to generating functions
Now that we are familiar with differentiation from first principle, we should consider:
we know
differentiate both sides
therefore we can conclude that
Note that we can obtain the above result by the substituion method as well,
letting z = x2 gives you the require result.

242
The above example demonstrated that we need not concern ourselves with difficult
differentiations. Rather, to get the results the easy way, we need only to differentiate the basic
forms and apply the substitution method. By basic forms we mean generating functions of the
form:
for n ≥  1.
Let's consider the number of solutions to
a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an = m
for ai ≥  0 for i = 1, 2, ... n.
We know that for any m, the number of solutions is the coefficient to:
as discussed before.
We start from:
differentiate both sides (note that 1 = 1!)
differentiate again
and so on for (n-1) times
divide both sides by (n-1)!

243
the above confirms the result derived using a counting argument.
Differentiate from first principle
1. . f'(z) = 3z2 (We know that if p(x) = xn then p'(x) = nxn − 1)
2.
f(z) = (1 − z)2 = z2 − 2z + 1
f'(z) = 2z − 2
3.

f(z) = (1 − z)3 = − z3 + 3z2 − 3z + 1
f'(z) = − 3z2 + 6z − 3

f(x)=g(x)+h(x)
then
Differentiating f(z) = (1 - z)^n

f(z) = (1 − z)3 = − z3 + 3z2 − 3z + 1
2.
f(z) = (1 + z)2 = z2 + 2z + 1

f(z) = (1 + z)3 = z3 + 3z2 + 3z + 1

this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications
made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to
a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent
if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited
only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-
generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

248
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
"Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions
whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you
make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must
also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other
material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
(directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original
publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

249
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of
the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a
network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied
from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--
for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them
all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the
end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same
adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements."
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of
this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to
the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent
of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and
the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License
or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title
(section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any
later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation
