Introduction
Introduction
This book is partly based on lectures I gave at NUI Galway and
Trinity College Dublin between 1998 and 2000. It is by no means a
comprehensive guide to all the mathematics an engineer might en-
counter during the course of his or her degree. The aim is more to
highlight and explain some areas commonly found diÔ¨Écult, such
as calculus, and to ease the transition from school level to uni-
versity level mathematics, where sometimes the subject matter is
similar, but the emphasis is usually diÔ¨Äerent. The early sections
on functions and single variable calculus are in this spirit. The
later sections on multivariate calculus, diÔ¨Äerential equations and
complex functions are more typically found on a Ô¨Årst or second
year undergraduate course, depending upon the university. The
necessary linear algebra for multivariate calculus is also outlined.
More advanced topics which have been omitted, but which you will
certainly come across, are partial diÔ¨Äerential equations, Fourier
transforms and Laplace transforms.

Introduction
This short text aims to be somewhere Ô¨Årst to look to refresh
your algebraic techniques and remind you of some of the principles
behind them. I have had to omit many topics and it is unlikely
that it will cover everything in your course. I have tried to make
it as clean and uncomplicated as possible.
Hopefully there are not too many mistakes in it, but if you Ô¨Ånd
any, have suggestions to improve the book or feel that I have not
covered something which should be included please send an email

Preliminaries
1.1
Number Systems: The Integers, Ratio-
nals and Reals
Calculus is a part of the mathematics of the real numbers. You
will probably be used to the idea of real numbers, as numbers on
a ‚Äúline‚Äù and working with graphs of real functions in the product
of two lines, i.e. a plane. To deÔ¨Åne rigorously what real numbers
are is not a trivial matter. Here we will mention two important
properties:

Preliminaries
‚Ä¢ The reals are ordered. That is, we can always say, for deÔ¨Ånite,
whether or not one real number is greater than, smaller than,
or equal to another. An example of the properties that the
ordering satisÔ¨Åes is that if x < y and z > 0 then zx < zy
but if x < y and z < 0 then zx > zy. This is important for
solving inequalities.
‚Ä¢ A real number is called rational if it can be written as p
q for
integers p and q (q Ã∏= 0). The reals, not the rationals, are the
usual system in which to speak of concepts such as limit and
continuity of functions, and also notions such as derivatives
and integrals. This is because they have a property called
completeness which means that if a sequence of real numbers

Preliminaries
looks like it has a limit (i.e. the distance between successive
terms can always be made to be smaller than a given positive
real number after a certain point) then it does have a limit.
The rationals do not have this property.
The real numbers are denoted by R and the rational numbers are
denoted by Q. We also use the notation N for the set of natural
numbers {1, 2, 3, . . .} and Z for the set of integers {. . . , ‚àí2, ‚àí1, 0,
1, 2, . . .}. For any positive integer n, ‚àön is either an integer, or it
is not rational. That is, it is an irrational number.
We will deal with two other number systems of numbers which de-
pend on the reals: vectors of real numbers, and complex numbers.

Preliminaries
1.2
Working With the Real Numbers
In this section we will introduce notation that is used throughout
the book and explain some basics of using the real numbers.
1.2.1
Intervals
An interval is a ‚Äúconnected‚Äù subset of R and can be bounded i.e.
of the form
‚Ä¢ [x, y] = {r in R | x ‚©Ωr ‚©Ωy} (closed),
‚Ä¢ (x, y) = {r in R | x < r < y} (open),
‚Ä¢ [x, y) = {r in R | x ‚©Ωr < y} (half-open) or
‚Ä¢ (x, y] = {r in R | x < r ‚©Ωy} (half-open).
or unbounded i.e. of the form
‚Ä¢ (‚àí‚àû, x] = {r in R | r ‚©Ωx},
‚Ä¢ (‚àí‚àû, x) = {r in R | r < x},
‚Ä¢ [x, ‚àû) = {r in R | r ‚©æx},
‚Ä¢ (x, ‚àû) = {r in R | r > x} or
‚Ä¢ (‚àí‚àû, ‚àû) = R.
1.2.2
Solving Inequalities
When solving inequalities, as opposed to equations, if you
multiply an inequality by a negative number then it reverses
the direction of the inequality.
For example x > 1 becomes ‚àíx < ‚àí1. People often remember to
do this if they are multiplying by a constant but not when they
multiply by a variable such as x, whose value is not known so it

could be positive or negative. So it is very important to split your
working into two cases if you have to multiply an inequality by a
variable.
Example 1.2.1 Find all real numbers x such that
12
x+4 ‚©æ2.
If x+4 < 0 then 12/(x+4) < 0 < 2. If x+4 = 0 then 12/(x+4) is
not deÔ¨Åned. Therefore x + 4 > 0, i.e. x > ‚àí4. Since x + 4 > 0 we
can multiply the inequality by x+4 without changing the direction
of inequality. This gives 12 ‚©æ2(x + 4) = 2x + 8. Hence 2x ‚©Ω4
which means that x ‚©Ω2. The solution set for the inequality is thus
the interval (‚àí4, 2].
Sketching a graph is a good way to double-check your answer.
The portion of the graph above the dotted horizontal line corre-
spons to the correct range of values.
1.2.3
Absolute Value
Let x be a real number. The absolute value or modulus of x, written
|x|, is the distance between x and 0 on the number line. So it is
always positive. It is deÔ¨Åned by
|x| =

1.2.4
Inequalities Involving Absolute Value
If y ‚©æ0 then the statement |x| < y means ‚àíy < x < y, that is,
x ‚àà(‚àíy, y). Consider the following graph to see why this is true.
Similarly
‚Ä¢ |x| ‚©Ωy means ‚àíy ‚©Ωx ‚©Ωy.
‚Ä¢ |x| > y means x > y or x < ‚àíy.
‚Ä¢ |x| ‚©æy means x ‚©æy or x ‚©Ω‚àíy.
‚Ä¢ |x| = y means x = y or x = ‚àíy (it is usual to write x = ¬±y).
Example 1.2.2
1. Find all x ‚ààR for which |x ‚àí1| ‚©Ω3.
We have |x ‚àí1| ‚©Ω3 if and only if ‚àí3 ‚©Ωx ‚àí1 ‚©Ω3. Adding 1,
‚àí2 ‚©Ωx ‚©Ω4 and the solution set is the interval [‚àí2, 4]. We
can check this by drawing a graph.
2. Find all real numbers x ‚ààR for which |x + 2| ‚©æ2.
If |x+2| ‚©æ2 then either x+2 ‚©Ω‚àí2 or x+2 ‚©æ2, i.e. x ‚©Ω‚àí4
or x ‚©æ0. So x satisÔ¨Åes the inequality if and only if it lies in
the set (‚àí‚àû, ‚àí4] ‚à™[0, ‚àû).

3. Find all x ‚ààR for which |x2 ‚àí4| > 3.
Suppose that |x2 ‚àí4| > 3. Then either x2 ‚àí4 > 3 or x2 ‚àí4 <
‚àí3.
If x2 ‚àí4 > 3 then either x >

x ‚àà(‚àí‚àû, ‚àí

7, ‚àû). If x2 ‚àí4 < ‚àí3 then x2 < 1 which
implies that x ‚àà(‚àí1, 1). Thus the complete solution set to
the inequality is

7, ‚àû),
1.3
Complex Numbers
1.3.1
Imaginary Numbers
There is only space here to give a brief overview of the complex
numbers. It is the number system formed when we want to in-
clude all square roots of the number system inside the system it-
self. Remarkably we can do this by adding a single extra number i
(standing for imaginary) such that i2 = ‚àí1. Of course there is no
real number with this property as squaring a real number always
results in something greater than or equal to zero.
Let y < 0. Then for some m > 0,
‚àöy =
‚àö
‚àím =
‚àö
‚àí1 ¬∑ ‚àöm = i‚àöm
A number of the form yi for y ‚ààR is called a purely imaginary
number. So square roots of real numbers are always real or purely
imaginary.

The Complex Number System and its Arith-
metic
What if we consider roots of purely imaginary numbers? Note that
(1 + i)2 = 12 + 2i + i2 = 1 + 2i ‚àí1 = 2i
So the expression on the left hand side, a sum of a real number
and a purely imaginary number, can be thought of as the square
root of a purely imaginary number.
A complex number is an expression of the form x+yi where x
amd y are real numbers and i2 = ‚àí1. The complex number
system is denoted by C.

Preliminaries
To add, subtract and multiply complex numbers, we use ordi-
nary rules of arithmetic and algebra and whenever it appears, we
substitute i2 with ‚àí1. For example
(3 ‚àí2i) + (5 + i)
=
8 ‚àíi
(6 + i) ‚àí(6 ‚àí2i)
=
3i
(2 ‚àíi)(3 + 2i)
=
6 ‚àí3i + 4i ‚àí2i2 = 8 + i
To divide a complex number by another complex number Ô¨Årst mul-
tiply the numerator and denominator by what is called the complex
conjugate of the complex number.
If z = a + ib then the complex conjugate of z, written z, is
a ‚àíib.
The properties of the complex conjugate are as follows.
‚Ä¢ zz = a2 + b2, which is real.
‚Ä¢ z + z = 2a, also real.
‚Ä¢ z ‚àíz = 2bi, which is purely imaginary.
For the purposes of division the Ô¨Årst of these properties is the most
important. For example
1 ‚àíi
2 + i ¬∑ 2 ‚àíi
2 ‚àíi
=
1
22 + 12 (1 ‚àíi)(2 ‚àíi)

Preliminaries
If the discriminant b2 ‚àí4ac < 0 then there are no real roots. But
in this case we in fact have two complex roots. For example x2 +
4x + 5 = 0 gives ‚àí2 ¬± 1
2
‚àö‚àí4 = ‚àí2 ¬± i.
It can be shown that the roots of such a quadratic equation, with
negative discriminant, always occur in conjugate pairs, i.e. they
are conjugates of each other.
We should also mention (but not
prove, as it is diÔ¨Écult) the following
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:
Given a polynomial
equation such as
xn + an‚àí1xn‚àí1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + a1x + a0,
the equation has at most n roots, all of which are in C.
So by introducing a single quantity, the imaginary square root of
‚àí1, we get a lot in return - all polynomial equations can now be
solved.
1.3.4
Geometry of Complex Numbers
A complex number z = x+iy can be plotted as (x, y) in the plane.
This plane is called the Argand diagram or the complex plane (c.f.
the real line). With this geometric interpretation,
‚Ä¢ z is the reÔ¨Çection of z in the x-axis.
‚Ä¢ |z| =

x2 + y2 is the modulus of z, the length of the
line segment from the origin to z.
‚Ä¢ for z Ã∏= 0, the argument of z, written arg z, is the
angle the same line segment makes with the real axis,
measured anti-clockwise.
So the modulus generalises the idea of the absolute value of a real
number, and argument generalises the idea of the sign of a real
number, in the sense that a complex number is a real number
x > 0 if and only if it has argument 0, and it is a real number

Preliminaries
x < 0 if and only if it has argument œÄ
2 . For example, |i| = 1 and
arg i = œÄ
2 . We can write any complex number in polar form, i.e. as
z = r(cos Œ∏ + i sin Œ∏) where r is |z| and Œ∏ is arg z. In general,
‚Ä¢ arg zw = arg z + arg w
‚Ä¢ |zw| = |z||w|
If x Ã∏= 0 then arg(z) = tan‚àí1( y
x). But it is important not to just
put the relevant values into your calculator and work out inverse
tangent because it will give you the wrong answer half of the time.
You need to draw a picture and work out which quadrant of the
complex plane the complex number is in. For example,

Preliminaries
The following is used to Ô¨Ånd roots (not just square ones) of
complex numbers:
De Moivre‚Äôs Theorem: (cos Œ∏ + i sin Œ∏)n = cos nŒ∏ + i sin nŒ∏
For example, to calculate the Ô¨Åfth roots of unity (one), we write
z = r(cos Œ∏ + i sin Œ∏) and seek to solve the equation
z5 = r5(cos Œ∏ + i sin Œ∏)5 = 1
So r = 1, because r > 0 is real, and by de Moivre‚Äôs theorem we
have
cos 5Œ∏ + i sin 5Œ∏ = 1.
Importantly, 5Œ∏ = arg1 does not just mean 5Œ∏ = 0 but that 5Œ∏ =
2œÄm for any integer m. This gives Œ∏ = 2œÄm
5
and m = 0, 1, 2, 3 and
4 all give unique values. So there are Ô¨Åve Ô¨Åfth roots of 1:
‚Ä¢ z1 = cos 0 + i sin 0 = 1
‚Ä¢ z2 = cos 2œÄ
5 + i sin 2œÄ
5
‚Ä¢ z3 = cos 4œÄ
5 + i sin 4œÄ

‚Ä¢ z4 = cos ‚àí4œÄ
5
+ i sin ‚àí4œÄ
5
‚Ä¢ z5 = cos 2œÄ
5 + i sin 2œÄ

We can plot them on an Argand diagram as follows: As an exercise,
try to calculate the sixth and seventh roots of 1, and the Ô¨Åfth roots
of ‚àí1.

Vectors and Matrices
Vectors and matrices can be thought of as generalisations of num-
bers. They have their own rules of arithmetic, like numbers, and a
number can be thought of as a vector of dimension 1 or a 1 by 1
matrix.
2.1
Vectors
Geometrically vectors are something with direction as well as mag-
nitude. More abstractly they are lists of real numbers. In diÔ¨Äerent
situations it helps to think of them as one or the other, or both. For
calculations treat them as lists of numbers. But it sometimes can
help intuition to think of them as geometric objects. The vector
x =
 a
b

has magniutude, more commonly called modulus,
|x| =

a2 + b2.
We will illustrate vector operations using vectors of length two or
three. Vectors can have any number of entries but the operations
on them are similar. Except for the cross product which is only
deÔ¨Åned for vectors of length three.

Another useful concept is the dot product or scalar product of
two vectors. This is deÔ¨Åned as
 a
b

¬∑
 c
d

= ac + bd
Note that the answer is a real number, not a vector.
The set of vectors of length n is denoted by Rn.
If x and y are vectors in Rn then we have
x ¬∑ y = |x||y| cos Œ∏
where Œ∏ is the angle between x and y. In particular,
‚Ä¢ If x and y are unit vectors (vectors whose modulus is 1) then
we have x ¬∑ y = cos Œ∏, so the dot product tells us the length
of the perpendicular projection of x onto y, and vice versa.
‚Ä¢ If x and y are perpendicular, then cos Œ∏ = 0 so the dot prod-
uct of the vectors is zero. Moreover, if |x| Ã∏= 0 and |y| Ã∏= 0
then x ¬∑ y = 0 implies that x and y are perpendicular.

Matrices and Determinants
2.2.1
Arithmetic of Matrices
Matrices are things which transform vectors to other vectors. If
we have a 2-dimensional vector, for example, we have to say where
each component of the vector goes to, which means 2 lots of 2. So
the obvious thing is to represent a matrix as a square of numbers,
like this:
 a
b
c
d

This means that
 x
y

goes to
 ax + by
cx + dy

under the transfor-
mation. If we follow it by another transformation
 e
f
g
h

we get
 e(ax + by) + f(cx + dy)
g(cx + dy) + h(ax + by)

=
 ea + fc
eb + fd
ga + hc
gb + hd
  x
y

And this shows us how to multiply matrices. You don‚Äôt need
to remember this, just the pattern of how it works.
When multiplying matrices, to get the entry in row p and
column q of the product of two matrices MN, form the dot
product of row p of M with column q of N.
The same rule works for multiplying n √ó m matrices by m √ó p
matrices. The product of two matrices is only deÔ¨Åned when the
number of columns of the Ô¨Årst is equal to the number of rows of
the second.
If a real number is not zero, we can divide another real number by
it, which is the opposite of multiplication. Similarly, there is an
opposite operation to multiplying by a matrix. It is just a bit more
involved, as is the criterion for when and when you can‚Äôt do it.

Inverse Matrices and Determinants
There is a special matrix called I, the identity matrix. For 2 √ó 2
matrices it is

and it has the property that for every 2 √ó 2 matrix A, IA = AI =
A.
The n √ó n identity matrix is written In and is the obvious
generalization of this.
A matrix B is called the inverse of a matrix A if AB =
BA = I. If a matrix A has an inverse then it is unique and
it is written as A‚àí1.
There is a test for whether or not a matrix A has an inverse.
You calculate something called the determinant of the matrix,
det A, sometimes written as |A|. For the 2 √ó 2 matrix
A =
 a

det A is equal to ad ‚àíbc.

The Cross Product
The cross product or vector product is a construction on vectors
but it has been included here because you need to know about
determinants to calculate them. You multiply two vectors and get
another vector, unlike the dot product where the answer is a scalar.
It is only deÔ¨Åned for three-dimensional vectors. If a = (ax, ay, az)
and b = (bx, by, bz) are vectors in R3 then their vector product
is written a √ó b and it is calculated by evaluating the following
‚Äúdeterminant‚Äù. The top row of the matrix contains unit vectors
i,j and k, so it isn‚Äôt the determinant of a real matrix but it is
calculated in the same way.

Row Reduction
There is a systematic way to solve the system of equations called
row reduction (sometimes it is also called Gaussian elimination).
You are allowed to use one of three moves:
‚Ä¢ multiply a row by a nonzero number
‚Ä¢ exchange two rows
‚Ä¢ add a multiple of a row to another row
We aim to reduce the matrix and the right hand side to ‚Äúrow-
echelon‚Äù form which means that all entries below the leading diag-
onal of the matrix (from the top left to the bottom right) should
be zero. To do this

‚Ä¢ Get zeros in the Ô¨Årst column below the diagonal, by
adding multiples of the Ô¨Årst row to each other row in
turn
‚Ä¢ Get zeros in the second column, by adding multiples
of the second row to each other row in turn (there is
only one other row for a 3 √ó 3 matrix).
‚Ä¢ And so on, if the matrix is larger than 3 √ó 3.
Once the system is row echelon form, the solution can be simply
read oÔ¨Ä.
A solution to a linear system of three equations in three unknowns
can be either
‚Ä¢ a point, i.e. a unique solution
‚Ä¢ a line of solutions, if one of the variables is unconstrained
‚Ä¢ a plane of solutions, if two of the variables are unconstrained
‚Ä¢ the entire three dimensional space, if all of the variables are
unconstrained
For row reduction it is common to omit the x, y and z and use a
bar to separate the left hand side from the right hand side. This
notation is called an ‚Äúaugmented‚Äù matrix.

Finding The Inverse of a Matrix Using Row
Reduction.
Row reduction can also be used to Ô¨Ånd the inverse of a matrix
eÔ¨Éciently. To do this we make another type of augmented matrix
with the identity matrix on the right hand side. When we use row
reduction to reduce the left hand side to the identity, the right hand
side becomes the inverse matrix. If it is not possible to reduce the
left hand side to the identity then that is because the left hand side
is not an invertible matrix.

Bases
A basis is like a linear co-ordinate system. Every vector in R2 can
be written as a(1, 0) + b(0, 1) for some real numbers a and b. The
pair (0, 1) and (1, 0) are called the standard basis of R2. But there
are many other pairs of vectors, like (1, 0) and (0, 1), that also
have this property. For example, (1, 2) and (3, 4) will do. To write
(x, y) = a(1, 2)+b(3, 4) we solve the system of equations x = a+3b
and y = 2a + 4b which gives
a = 3y ‚àí4x
2
, b = x ‚àíy
2.
Moreover, for any (x, y) the required a and b is unique.
A basis of R2 is a pair of vectors (v, w) in R2 such that every
vector in R2 can be written uniquely as av + bw.
Of course, we can speak similarly about a basis of Rn for any n, the
standard basis in Rn, which has the obvious deÔ¨Ånition, and it turns
out that any basis for Rn has to consist of precisely n vectors.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Suppose that we have a linear transformation T which sends the
basis B = {v1, v2} to {av1 + bv2, cv1 + dv2}. Then the matrix of T
with respect to B is
 a
b
c
d

In particular, if T sends B to {Œª1v1, Œª2v2} then B is called an
eigenbasis of T, Œª1 and Œª2 are called eigenvalues of T and v1 and
v2 are called eigenvectors of T.
That is, Tv1 = Œª1v1 and Tv2 = Œªv2. This is useful because we
can more easily Ô¨Ånd powers and limits of a matrix representing
T. With respect to an eigenbasis the matrix of a transformation
is diagonal, meaning all entries not on the leading diagonal are 0.
For example,
A =

There is a process for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors which
relies on (a) calculating determinants (b) row reduction. Eigenval-
ues Œª of an n√ón matrix A, and corresponding eigenvectors v satisfy
Av = Œªv, which can be rewritten as (A ‚àíŒªIn)v = 0. This is a sys-
tem of linear equations with zeros in the right hand side, and has
a solution if and only if that solution is non-unique. That is

roots. A typical exam question would ask to calculate the eigenval-
ues and eigenvectors of a 3 √ó 3 matrix. This entails the following

Recall from the section on solving systems of equations that the
solution can either be a point, a line, a plane or all of three dimen-
sions (for a system of three equations in three variables). We saw
in that section an example where the solution was a point (i.e. a
unique solution). In this case the solution is a line. This is because
the bottom row says 0z = 0, which tells us nothing about z, mean-
ing that z is unconstrained. When Ô¨Ånding eigenvectors the solution
sets always turn out to be at least one-dimensional. This is because
any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector, by the
deÔ¨Ånition of an eigenvector.

Functions
3.1.1
DeÔ¨Ånition of a function.
Let X and Y be sets. A function f : X ‚ÜíY assigns a unique value
of y to every value of x. So technically, f is actually a certain type
of set of pairs of points (x, y) with x ‚ààX and y ‚ààY . That is all.
X is called the domain of f and Y is called the range of f.
Example 3.1.1 Let X = Y be the set of all people who have ever
lived. Suppose that we deÔ¨Åne f : X ‚ÜíX by the rule: f(x) is the
father of x. Then this is a well deÔ¨Åned function (everyone has a
father, and only one father). On the other hand, we may deÔ¨Åne
c : X ‚ÜíX by deÔ¨Åning c(x) to be the child of x. This is not a
function since a given individual may have (a) no children or (b)
more than one child.
Example 3.1.2 Let X = Y = R.
Then f(x) = x2 deÔ¨Ånes a
function whereas f(x) = ‚àöx does not, since every nonzero real
number has two square roots.
We usually write f for a function and f(x) for the value of f at
x. We must be careful when specifying functions. Often whether

or not something is deÔ¨Åned as a function depends on the domain.
For example, f(x) = 1
x is not a function from R to R because f(0)
is not deÔ¨Åned. It is, however, a function from (‚àí‚àû, 0) ‚à™(0, ‚àû) to
R.

Piping Functions Together
There are a few ways of constructing new functions from old ones.
One of these is called composition. Given two functions f : R ‚ÜíR
and g : R ‚ÜíR we may construct a third function g ‚ó¶f : R ‚ÜíR,
called g composed with f by the rule
g ‚ó¶f(x) = g(f(x)).
For example, if f(x) = x2 and g(x) = x + 1 then g ‚ó¶f(x) = x2 + 1
whereas f ‚ó¶g(x) = (x + 1)2.
Also, if f and g are both functions from R to R then we can deÔ¨Åne
functions
1. f + g : R ‚ÜíR by (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x),
2. f ‚àíg : R ‚ÜíR by (f ‚àíg)(x) = f(x) ‚àíg(x),
3. fg : R ‚ÜíR by (fg)(x) = f(x)g(x),
4.

g : R ‚ÜíR by f
g (x) = f(x)

6. fk : R ‚ÜíR by (fk)(x) = (f(x))k (where deÔ¨Åned).
Later, as we meet rules for manipulating limits, derivatives and
integrals, you will see that they are usually concerned with building
functions up in the ways above.

Inverse Functions
A function f : R ‚ÜíR is injective if f(x1) = f(x2) always implies
that x1 = x2. If f(x) = 2x then f is injective because if 2x1 = 2x2
then x1 = x2. If we draw a horizontal line across the graph of an
injective function the line will never meet more than one point of
the graph. The function g : R ‚ÜíR, g(x) = x2 is not injective. For
example, g(‚àí1) = g(1).
We say that f : R ‚ÜíR is surjective if for every y ‚ààR there is
an x ‚ààR with f(x) = y. The function f(x) = x3 is surjective,
since given y ‚ààR the number y
1
3 maps onto y (every real number
has a unique cube root, unlike the case for square roots). In the
graph of a surjective function, every horizontal line intersects the
graph in at least one point, as in the graph of x3. The function
f(x) = sin(x) is an example of a function from R to R which is
not surjective. For example, there is no real number x such that
sin(x) = 2.
If f is both injective and surjective then we say it is bijective, or
that it is a bijection. For example, f(x) = 2x and f(x) = x3 both
have this property. In order for us to be able to deÔ¨Åne an inverse
for f (i.e. a function f‚àí1 such that f‚àí1 ‚ó¶f(x) = x for all x), f
must be a bijection. For example, f(x) = sin(x) has no inverse
f‚àí1 : R ‚ÜíR, although we can deÔ¨Åne
sin‚àí1 : [‚àí1, 1] ‚Üí[‚àíœÄ/2, œÄ/2].

Functions and Limits
3.2
Limits
The formal deÔ¨Ånition of a limit of a function is technical and has
been omitted. We speak of the limit of a function as it tends to
either ‚àû, ‚àí‚àûor some real number, often 0. It is perhaps easier to
see the need for the Ô¨Årst two cases. But the third is also useful when
deÔ¨Åning derivatives and similar constructions where you let ‚àÜbe
a small quantity or change, then take the limit of some function as
‚àÜtends to zero.
Example 3.2.1
1. Let f(x) = e‚àíx2, f : R ‚ÜíR, which has the
following graph:
As x becomes arbitrarily large, f(x) becomes arbitrarily close
to 0. This also occurs as x becomes arbitrarily negative. We
write
limx‚Üí‚àûf(x) = 0
and
limx‚Üí‚àí‚àûf(x) = 0.
2. Let f(x) = 1
x, f : (‚àí‚àû, 0) ‚à™(0, ‚àû) ‚ÜíR:

As x becomes arbitrarily close to 0, either from the left or
from the right, y does not become arbitrarily close to any
value. In fact it becomes arbitrarily far away from any value!
In this situation we say that
limx‚Üí0f(x)
does not exist.
3. Let f(x) = x2.
As x becomes arbitrarily large, so does f(x). Here we say
that
limx‚Üí‚àûf(x)
does not exist. Similarly,
limx‚Üí‚àí‚àûf(x)
does not exist.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Continuity
Informally, a real function is continuous if the graph does not sud-

That is, a very
small change in x will only produce a very small change in f(x).
More precisely, f : X ‚ÜíR is said to be continuous if for all a in

Rules of Continuity Let f : R ‚ÜíR and g : R ‚ÜíR be
functions which are continuous at x0 ‚ààR. Then
1. f + g and f ‚àíg are continuous at x0
2. fg is continuous at x0
3. kf is continuous at x0 for any k ‚ààR.
4. If g(x) is never 0 then f
g is continuous at x0.
5. fp is continuous at x0 for any p ‚ààR where deÔ¨Åned
6. If g is continuous at f(x0) then g ‚ó¶f is continuous at
x0.
Most functions that you are familiar with are continuous.
For
example all polynomial functions f(x) = anxn + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ a1x + a0 are
continuous, sin, cos, the exponential and logarithmic functions are
all continuous, and rational functions
f(x) = anxn + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ a1x + a0
bmxm + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ b1x + b0
are continuous at all points x where bmxm +¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ b1x+b0 Ã∏= 0. They
are not deÔ¨Åned at the points x where bmxm + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ b1x + b0 = 0, so
it doesn‚Äôt make sense to ask whether or not they are continuous
there. For example, the function f : (‚àí‚àû, 0) ‚à™(0, ‚àû) ‚ÜíR deÔ¨Åned
by f(x) = 1
x is continuous. However if we let L be any real value
then the function f : R ‚ÜíR deÔ¨Åned by
f(x) =

1
x
if x Ã∏= 0
L
if x = 0
is not.
The Intermediate Value Theorem Let f : [a, b] ‚ÜíR be
a continuous function. Then for all y ‚ààR between f(a) and
f(b) there exists a value x ‚àà[a, b] such that f(x) = y.

This theorem is used for showing that roots of equations exist.
Example 3.3.2 The function f(x) = x3 ‚àíx ‚àí1 is continuous
because it is a polynomial function.
f(1) = ‚àí1 and f(2) = 5.
Since 0 ‚àà[‚àí1, 5] there exists x0 ‚àà[1, 2] such that f(x0) = 0, i.e.
the equation x3 ‚àíx ‚àí1 = 0 has a root in [1, 2]. In fact the root is
about 1.324718.
The conclusion of the intermediate value theorem is only true for
continuous functions. For example let f : [‚àí1, 1] ‚ÜíR be deÔ¨Åned
by
f(x) =
 1
if x ‚àà[‚àí1, 0]
‚àí1
if x ‚àà(0, 1].
If we choose any value y ‚àà(‚àí1, 1) then there is no x ‚àà[‚àí1, 1] with
f(x) = y.

Calculus of One Variable
For example, what is the gradient of the graph of f(x) = |x|
at x = 0? Is it 1? -1? Or should we take an average of these and
say that the gradient is 0? None of those make sense, particularly,
so we just say it is not deÔ¨Åned. The mathematical name for being
able to deÔ¨Åne a gradient at a point a of the graph of a function
f : R ‚ÜíR is diÔ¨Äerentiability at a.
Recall how the gradient to a curve at a point is deÔ¨Åned.
The tangent to the graph at x is approximated by the line which
extends the sloping side of the triangle shown. The gradient of this
approximation is
f(x + h) ‚àíf(x)
h
.
We want to take the limit of this as h ‚Üí0, if the limit exists.
f : R ‚ÜíR is diÔ¨Äerentiable at x ‚ààR if this limit exists:
lim
h‚Üí0
f(x + h) ‚àíf(x)
h
If the limit does exist, then we deÔ¨Åne the derivative of f
at x, written f‚Ä≤(x), to be the value of the limit. This is also
written as
d
dxf(x).
If f is diÔ¨Äerentiable at all points x ‚ààR then we say that it
is diÔ¨Äerentiable and deÔ¨Åne the derivative of f to be the
function f‚Ä≤ given by
f‚Ä≤(x) = lim
h‚Üí0
f(x + h) ‚àíf(x)
h

Example 4.1.1
1. Let f(x) = |x|, whose graph is as above.
Then
f(0 + h) ‚àíf(0)
h
= |h|
h
The graph of g : (‚àí‚àû, 0) ‚à™(0, ‚àû) ‚ÜíR given by g(h) = |h|/h
is as follows.
We see that limh‚Üí0+ g(h) = 1 whereas limh‚Üí0‚àíg(h) = ‚àí1.
Hence limh‚Üí0 g(h) doesn‚Äôt exist, or these one sided limits
would both give the same value. Thus f is not diÔ¨Äerentiable
at 0.
2. Let f(x) = x2. Then
f(x + h) ‚àíf(x)
h
= (x + h)2 ‚àíx2
h
We saw in section 1.2 that this limit exists and is equal to
2x.
Thus the derivative of f is the function f‚Ä≤ given by
f‚Ä≤(x) = 2x. We can show similarly that if n is any natural
number then
f(x) = xn is diÔ¨Äerentiable and f‚Ä≤(x) = nxn‚àí1.
DiÔ¨Äerentiability at a point implies continuity at that point.
It
follows that diÔ¨Äerentiable functions are continuous. However, con-
tinuous functions need not neccessarily be diÔ¨Äerentiable, as the
example of the function f given by f(x) = |x| shows.

The Chain Rule
The chain rule tells us how to diÔ¨Äerentiate the composition of two
functions.
The Chain Rule: If f and g are functions from R to R, f
is diÔ¨Äerentiable at x ‚ààR and g is diÔ¨Äerentiable at f(x) then
g o f is diÔ¨Äerentiable at x and
(g ‚ó¶f)‚Ä≤(x) = g‚Ä≤(f(x))f‚Ä≤(x)
This theorem is also true for functions only deÔ¨Åned on subsets of
R, provided that we can compose them.
Thus if f and g are diÔ¨Äerentiable (everywhere) then so is g ‚ó¶f and
we have
(g ‚ó¶f)‚Ä≤ = (g‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶f)f‚Ä≤.
We can now prove the power rule for all rational indices p.
The power rule is
d
dx(xp) = pxp‚àí1 (x Ã∏= 0 if p < 1).
We did this for x2 from Ô¨Årst principles. It follows by induction for
all p ‚ààN by the product rule, since
d
dx(xp)
=
d
dx(x.xp‚àí1)
=
(p ‚àí1)xp‚àí2.x + 1.xp‚àí1 (by the product rule)
=
(p ‚àí1 + 1)xp‚àí1
=
pxp‚àí1.
If p = 0,
d
dx(1) = 0 everywhere (this can‚Äôt be incorporated into the
power rule if x = 0).

DiÔ¨Äerentiating Inverse Functions
If f is diÔ¨Äerentiable and bijective, and hence has an inverse function
f‚àí1, then we can show that f‚àí1 is also diÔ¨Äerentiable at points
where f‚Ä≤(x) Ã∏= 0. In fact since f‚àí1(f(x)) = x for all x we have
d
dx

f‚àí1(f(x))

= d
dx(x) = 1.
and by the chain rule, if we write y = f(x) then
(f‚àí1)‚Ä≤(y) =
1
f‚Ä≤(x)
provided f‚Ä≤(x) Ã∏= 0, i.e. we have
(f‚àí1)‚Ä≤ = 1
f‚Ä≤
For example, if we let y = sin(x) then we can diÔ¨Äerentiate sin‚àí1(x)
using this method. Recall from chapter 1 that
sin : [‚àíœÄ
2 , œÄ
2 ] ‚Üí[‚àí1, 1]
is a bijection, so sin‚àí1 is diÔ¨Äerentiable everywhere in its domain
[‚àí1, 1] except at ‚àí1 and 1, where dy
dx = 0.
We have

Implicit DiÔ¨Äerentiation
1. DiÔ¨Äerentiate the entire equation, possibly using the
chain rule.
2. Rearrange the result to get the desired derivative.
Sometimes we may have a curve deÔ¨Åned implicitly. For instance
in the (x, y)-plane, the circle of radius 1 is the set of all points
(x, y) such that x2 + y2 = 1. Here we would say that y is given
implicitly in terms of x as opposed to if it appears in the form
y = f(x) for some function x, where we would say that y is given
explicitly. Note that the graph of the above curve is not the graph
of a function. For instance (0, 1) and (0, ‚àí1) are both points on
the graph with x-co-ordinate equal to 0. In the graph of a function
there can only be one such point.
In general y appears implicitly in terms of x whenever F(x, y) =
0 for some function F : R2 ‚ÜíR. For instance, above we have
F(x, y) = x2 + y2 ‚àí1.
However, even though this does not always deÔ¨Åne y as a function
of x we can still diÔ¨Äerentiate an implicit formula for y in terms of
x, by using the chain rule.
Example 4.5.1 DiÔ¨Äerentiating the formula

with respect to x, we obtain
2x + 2y dy
dx = 0
which gives
dy
dx = ‚àíx
y .
This is only valid for y Ã∏= 0. The values where y = 0 are when
x = 1 and x = ‚àí1. In both of these places the graph of the circle
has a vertical tangent and so its gradient at these points is not
deÔ¨Åned.
Notice also that if y Ã∏= 0 and |y| ‚©Ω1 there are two values of y
for a given value of x and that one is +
‚àö
1 ‚àíx2 and the other is
‚àí
‚àö
1 ‚àíx2. This allows us to deÔ¨Åne two functions (called branches)
f+ : [‚àí1, 1] ‚ÜíR deÔ¨Åned by f+(x) = +
‚àö
1 ‚àíx2 and f‚àí: [‚àí1, 1] ‚Üí
R deÔ¨Åned by f‚àí(x) = ‚àí
‚àö
1 ‚àíx2. The two possible values of dy/dx
for each value of x are just the derivatives of each of these functions
at x.
For most implicit formulae there are many diÔ¨Äerent branches and
many diÔ¨Äerent values of the derivative for a given x. For such for-
mulae you should either specify a branch or refer to the ‚Äúderivative
at (x, y)‚Äù
Example 4.5.2 DiÔ¨Äerentiate
(y + x)5 = sin(x7)e3y.
We have
5(y + x)4(dy
dx + 1) = 7x6 cos(x7)e3y + sin(x7).3dy
dxe3y.
Therefore
dy
dx(5(y + x)4 ‚àí3e3y sin(x7)) = 7x6 cos(x7)e3y ‚àí5(y + x)4
which gives
dy
dx = 7x6 cos(x7)e3y ‚àí5(y + x)4
5(y + x)4 ‚àí3e3y sin(x7) .

Logarithmic DiÔ¨Äerentiation
1. Take logs of the whole equation and apply the loga-
rithmic manipulation rules.
2. DiÔ¨Äerentiate implicitly.
3. Rearrange to get the desired derivative.
Try to diÔ¨Äerentiate xx. You can‚Äôt treat this as a polynomial be-
cause the power is not constant. Similarly you can‚Äôt treat it as an
exponential function. Let y = xx. Taking logs we have
log(y) = x log x
and diÔ¨Äerentiating implicitly we obtain

dx = 1 + log(x)

hence
dy
dx = y(1 + log(x)) = xx(1 + log(x))
This illustrates the principle of logarithmic diÔ¨Äerentiation, really
just a special case of implicit diÔ¨Äerentiation.
It can be used to
simplify the number of operations you have to perform when dif-
ferentiating a complicated product or quotient.
Example 4.6.1 Suppose that we want to diÔ¨Äerentiate
y =
‚àö
x2 + 1(x + 5)3
(x + 1)2
First take logs and use logarithm manipulation rules:
log(y) = 1
2 log(x2 + 1) + 3 log(x + 5) ‚àí2 log(x + 1)
Then diÔ¨Äerentiate implicitly:
1
y
dy
dx = 1
2.
2x
x2 + 1 +
3
x + 5 ‚àí
2
x + 1
Rearranging,
dy
dx
=
y(
x
x2 + 1 +
3
x + 5 ‚àí
2
x + 1)
=
‚àö
x2 + 1(x + 5)3
(x + 1)2
(
x
x2 + 1 +
3
x + 5 ‚àí
2
x + 1).
Of course this is not a particularly elegant expression, but using
the quotient rule would require similar simpliÔ¨Åcation.

1. DiÔ¨Äerentiate implicitly
cos(y2) = sin(y3)

Note that the functions in (b) and (c) are not the same. It is
a coincidence that they have the same value for x = 2; 22 = 4
so (22)2 = 42 = 16 and 2(22) = 24 = 16. However, 33 = 27

Higher Derivatives
A function f : R ‚ÜíR is twice diÔ¨Äerentiable if f is diÔ¨Äerentiable
and f‚Ä≤ is diÔ¨Äerentiable. The derivative of f‚Ä≤ is denoted by f‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ and
is called the second derivative of f. We may similarly deÔ¨Åne
an n-times diÔ¨Äerentiable function and denote the nth derivative
of such a function by f(n)(x).
The n should be in brackets to
distinguish from the nth power of f.
If y = f(x) then we also
denote f(n)(x) by
dny
dxn .
A function which is n-times diÔ¨Äerentiable for all n is called smooth.
For example, polynomials, sin, cos and exponential functions are
smooth.

L‚ÄôHÀÜopital‚Äôs Rule
To Ô¨Ånd limits of some quotients you can diÔ¨Äerentiate the
numerator and denominator Ô¨Årst, and the limit stays the
same.
Quite often when we try to Ô¨Ånd a limit using the quotient rule we
obtain an ‚Äúanswer‚Äù like
0
0, ‚àû
‚àû, 0 √ó ‚àû, ‚àû‚àí‚àû, 1‚àû, 00, ‚àû0, or 0‚àû.
The above pieces of nonsense are called indeterminate forms. If
you obtain an indeterminate form you have to resort to some other
means of Ô¨Ånding the limit.
Example 4.8.1 Find
lim
x‚Üí0
sin(x)
x
.
We see that as x ‚Üí0, both sin(x) and x tend to 0, leading to the
indeterminate form 0
0.
Based on diÔ¨Äerentiation, l‚ÄôHÀÜopital‚Äôs Rule is a very useful and pow-
erful technique for evaluating these kind of limits.
When the relevant limits exist, are deÔ¨Åned and are nonzero
if in the denominator, and the relevant functions are diÔ¨Äer-
entiable,
1.
lim
x‚Üíx0
f(x)
g(x) = f‚Ä≤(x0)
g‚Ä≤(x0) .
2.
lim
x‚Üíx0
f(x)
g(x) = lim
x‚Üíx0
f‚Ä≤(x)
g‚Ä≤(x) .
3. If f‚Ä≤(x)
g‚Ä≤(x) ‚Üí‚àûas x ‚Üíx0 then f(x)
g(x) ‚Üí‚àûas x ‚Üíx0.
4. If f‚Ä≤(x)
g‚Ä≤(x) ‚Üí‚àí‚àûas x ‚Üíx0 then f(x)
g(x) ‚Üí‚àí‚àûas x ‚Üíx0.

We can also use the same rules to calculate left-hand and right-
hand limits.
Example 4.8.2
1. Let f(x) = sin(x) and let g(x) = x. Both
functions are diÔ¨Äerentiable. f(0) = g(0) = 0 and g‚Ä≤(0) = 1 Ã∏=
0. Thus
lim
x‚Üí0
sin(x)
x
= cos(0)
1
= 1.
2. Find
lim
x‚Üí0
cos(x) ‚àí1
x
Let f(x) = cos(x) ‚àí1 and let g(x) = x. f(0) = g(0) = 0 so
by l‚ÄôHÀÜopital‚Äôs rule we have
lim
x‚Üí0
cos(x) ‚àí1
x
=
‚àísin(0)
1
= 0
3. Alternatively, if we assume the above limits we can diÔ¨Äeren-
tiate sin(x) from Ô¨Årst principles.
Let f(x) = sin(x). Then
f‚Ä≤(x)
=
lim
h‚Üí0
sin(x + h) ‚àísin(x)
h
=
lim
h‚Üí0
sin(x) cos(h) ‚àícos(x)sin(h) ‚àísin(x)
h
=
lim
h‚Üí0
sin(x)(cos(h) ‚àí1) + cos(x) sin(h)
h
=
lim
h‚Üí0

sin(x).cos(h) ‚àí1
h

+ lim
h‚Üí0

cos(x).sin(h)
(h)

(by the sum rule for limits)
=
sin(x).0 + cos(x).1 (by the product rule for limits)
=
cos(x).
There are also forms of l‚ÄôHÀÜopital‚Äôs rule to deal with (a) limits of
quotients of functions which both tend to ‚àû(b) limits of quotients
as x ‚Üí‚àû.

Taylor Series
Polynomials are easy to diÔ¨Äerentiate and integrate. It is easy to Ô¨Ånd
limits of rational functions (quotients of polynomials). We would
therefore like to be able to approximate functions by polynomials.
Recall that a polynomial is an expression of the form
anxn + an‚àí1xn‚àí1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + a1x + a0,
where a0, . . . , an are constants. The simplest case is to take T0(x) =
a0, i.e. T0(x) is a constant function with value a0.

Clearly we have not taken much of the behaviour of f into
account. If f is also diÔ¨Äerentiable at x0 then we can improve our
approximation by deÔ¨Åning
T1(x) = f0 + (x ‚àíx0)f‚Ä≤(x0)
to be the tangent line to f at x0.
The constant function T0 is a degree 0 polynomial whose graph
passes through f(x0). The tangent line is a degree 1 polynomial
whose graph passes through f(x0), and whose derivative matches
that of f at x0. The idea of the nth Taylor polynomial Tn is that
it continues this sequence of approximations.
Example 4.9.1
1. Suppose that f(x) = ex and we want a de-
gree 2 polynomial (quadratic) T2(x) satisfying
T2(0)
=
f(0) = 1
T ‚Ä≤
2(0)
=
f‚Ä≤(0) = 1
T ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
2 (0)
=
f‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(0) = 1
Let
T2(x) = a2x2 + a1x + a0.
Then we have
T ‚Ä≤
2(x)
=
2a2x + a1

2 (x)

These equations hold for all x, in particular for x = 0. Sub-
stituting x = 0 in every equation gives a0 = 1, a1 = 1 and
a2 = 1
2. We therefore have
T2(x) = 1 + x + x2
2
If you like think of this as the ‚Äútangent quadratic‚Äù to f at
0, although ‚Äútangent‚Äù now means that the second deriva-
tive of the quadratic also matches that of ex. The name of
this quadratic is the second Taylor polynomial of f at 0.
2. What is the second Taylor polynomial T2 to f at 2, i.e. the
quadratic analogue of the tangent line at 2? Denote this also
by
T2(x) = a2x2 + a1x + a0
We require
T2(2)
=
f(2) = e2
T ‚Ä≤
2(2)
=
f‚Ä≤(2) = e2
T ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
2 (2)
=
f‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(2) = e2
The reason the previous calculation was easy was because
when we substituted x = 0, every expression involving x
vanished. Substituting x = 2 will not have this eÔ¨Äect. So we
‚Äúcheat‚Äù and move the y-axis! Suppose that we let y = x ‚àí2.

Then we still have T2(y) = a2y2 + a1y + a0. Now, as in the
previous example we have
T2(y)

a2y2 + a1y + a0
T ‚Ä≤
2(y)
=
2a2y + a1
T ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
2 (y)
=
2a2
When x = 2, y = 0 so we have 2a2 = T ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
2 when y = 0. This
is equal to T ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
2 when x = 2, i.e. equal to f‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(2) = e2. Thus
a2 = e2/2. Similarly, a1 = e2 and a0 = e2. The second Taylor
polynomial of f at x = 2 is hence given by
T2(y) = e2 + e2y + e2y2
2
where y = x ‚àí2.

If a = 0 then the above series is called a MacLaurin series.
We are interested in when this series deÔ¨Ånes a function from I to
R and when it is equal to f. It deÔ¨Ånes such a function precisely
when it converges everywhere on I.
Example 4.9.5 We can‚Äôt calculate a Maclaurin series for f(x) =
1
x because f(0) is not deÔ¨Åned. However, we can calculate a Taylor
series for f at a = 1. The kth derivative of f is given by
f(k)(x) = (‚àí1)k.k!.x‚àí(k+1)
(If this general formula seems diÔ¨Écult, calculate the Ô¨Årst few deriva-
tives and the pattern will become apparent).
Hence f(k)(1) =
(‚àí1)k.k!. The Taylor series is then given by
f(1) + f‚Ä≤(1)(x ‚àí1) + f‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(1)

let [a, b]min denote the minimum value.
We take two approximations to the area. Let n be a positive integer
and divide [a, b] into n equal intervals.
First take the following
shaded area.

Antiderivatives
Let f be a real function. A diÔ¨Äerentiable real function F is an an-
tiderivative or indeÔ¨Ånite integral of f if for all x, F ‚Ä≤(x) = f(x).
Antiderivatives are unique, up to possibly adding a constant func-
tion.
We write

f(x)dx = F(x) + C
to mean that F(x) is the unique derivative of x, up to possibly
adding a constant C. Note that this is the same notation as used for
the area under a curve. This is because of the fundamental theorem
of calculus which states formally that integration (Ô¨Ånding areas
under curves) and diÔ¨Äerentiation (Ô¨Ånding gradients) are inverse
operations of each other.

To Ô¨Ånd antiderivatives there are various techniques. The sim-
plest is to reverse the formulae for derivatives.
Example 5.3.1

xndx = xn+1
n + 1 + C
since
d
dx
 xn+1
n + 1

= n + 1
n + 1xn = xn.
Using this process, we obtain the following list of standard inte-
grals:
f(x)
F(x) =

f(x)dx
cosx
sinx + C
sinx
‚àícosx + C

‚àícotx + C
secx tan

‚àícotx + C
ex

Certain rules hold for antiderivatives; these come from the corre-
sponding rules for derivatives.

f(x)dx (for a constant k)

(f(x) + g(x))dx

The product rule for diÔ¨Äerentiation tells us that

(f‚Ä≤(x)g(x) + f(x)g‚Ä≤(x))dx = f(x)g(x) + C
To deal with integrals of products we require integration by parts
(later). Similarly,
 f(x)
g(x) dx
does not have a simple formula.
The technique which corresponds to operating the chain rule back-
wards is called integration by substitution in the next section, which
will deal with integrals of the form

f‚Ä≤(x)g‚Ä≤(f(x))dx.
Examples 5.3.2
1. Using the product rule for diÔ¨Äerentiation
backwards,

Integration by Substitution
We saw in the last section that the chain rule may be applied in
reverse to Ô¨Ånd antiderivatives.
It can be diÔ¨Écult to do this by
inspection. A good way of keeping track is to use substitution. For
example, suppose that we wish to integrate

x8(x9 + 1)2dx
We recognise that the integrand
x8(x9 + 1)2
looks like the derivative of
(x9 + 1)3.
So we substitute u = x9 + 1 in the integral.

The important thing to notice is that we now have to integrate
with respect to u and not x. So we calculate

27(x9 + 1)3 + C

27.3(x9 + 1)2.9x8 + 0,
which is correct.
Formally, we are using the following rule, which is essentially the
chain rule.

f(g(x))g‚Ä≤(x)dx =

f(u)du where u = g(x).
Substitution is a versatile technique - we now look at some more
examples.

Partial Fractions
The method of partial fractions is an algebraic technique which can
be thought of as ‚ÄúÔ¨Ånding a common denominator in reverse‚Äù. It
allows us to express rational functions as sums of simpler rational
functions.
Example 5.5.1
1. Find real numbers A and B such that for
all x we have
x + 1
(x ‚àí1)(x ‚àí7) =
A
x ‚àí1 +
B
x ‚àí7
Multiply throughout by (x-1)(x-7) to get x + 1 = A(x ‚àí7) +
B(x ‚àí1). Let x = 7 to make the coeÔ¨Écient of A equal to
0. This gives 8 = 6B and so B = 4
3. Let x = 1 to make
the coeÔ¨Écient of B equal to 0. This gives 2 = ‚àí6A. Thus
A = ‚àí1
3. Hence
x + 1
(x ‚àí1)(x ‚àí7) =
‚àí1
3(x ‚àí1) +
4
3(x ‚àí7)
You can check that the expression is correct by Ô¨Ånding a
common denominator on the right hand side.
2. Find A and B such that
2 ‚àíx
(x + 1)(x ‚àí3) =
A
x + 1 +
B
x ‚àí3

Essential Engineering Mathematics
94 
Calculus of One Variable
We have 2 ‚àíx = A(x ‚àí3) + B(x + 1). x = 3 gives B = ‚àí1
4
and x = ‚àí1 gives A = ‚àí3
4. Thus
2 ‚àíx
(x + 1)(x ‚àí3) =
‚àí3
4(x + 1) +
‚àí1
4(x ‚àí3)
The main application of partial fractions is to integration of ratio-
nal functions.
Example 5.5.2 Find

2 ‚àíx
(x + 1)(x ‚àí3)dx
Using expression as partial fractions the integral becomes

3
4(x + 1) +

dx
x ‚àí3

4log|x ‚àí3| + C
Note the modulus signs in the log expressions. If x can take values
less than 0 then
 dx
x = log|x| + C.
There are various other possibilities when Ô¨Ånding partial fractions.

Calculus of One Variable
This gives 6x + 7 = A(x + 2) + B = Ax + 2A + B.
CoeÔ¨Écients of x give A = 6. CoeÔ¨Écients of 1 give B = ‚àí5.
Thus
6x + 7
(x + 2)2 =
6
x + 2 ‚àí

(x + 2)2

Integration by Parts
Integration by parts is a substitute for having no product rule for
integration. Let u and v be functions of the real variable x. The
product rule for diÔ¨Äerentiation is
(uv)‚Ä≤ = uv‚Ä≤ + u‚Ä≤v
Which we can integrate to get
uv =

uv‚Ä≤dx +

u‚Ä≤vdx
or

u‚Ä≤vdx = uv ‚àí

uv‚Ä≤dx
Example 5.6.1 Find

xexdx
Let u(x) = ex and v(x) = x. Then

xexdx = xex ‚àí

ex.1dx = xex ‚àíex + C = (x ‚àí1)ex + C
If we had done it the other way, i.e. u(x) = x and v(x) = ex we
would have got
x2
2 ex ‚àí1

x2exdx
which is worse!
Sometimes we have to apply the formula more than once.

Reduction Formulae
Integration by parts becomes tedious for integrals with large powers
e.g.

x6cosxdx

x259exdx
For such integrals it is better to use a reduction formula. These are
best understood by example. Suppose that we want an expression
for
In =

xnexdx
in terms of
In‚àí1 =

xn‚àí1exdx.
We Ô¨Årst use integration by parts to derive the formula, i.e.
In
=

xnexdx
=
xnex ‚àí

nxn‚àí1exdx
(let u = ex and v = xn)
=
xnex ‚àín

xn‚àí1exdx
=
xnex ‚àínIn‚àí1
Now we can use the formula to integrate, say

x3exdx
We have
I3
=
x3ex ‚àí3I2
=
x3ex ‚àí3(x2ex ‚àí2I1)
=
x3ex ‚àí3x2ex + 6(xex ‚àíI0)
=
x3ex ‚àí3x2ex + 6xex ‚àí6I0
But I0 =

exdx = ex + C. Hence
I3 = x3ex ‚àí3x2ex + 6xex ‚àí6ex + C
We can also derive reduction formulae for deÔ¨Ånite integrals.

However, consider the following graph. All of the area under the
curve is above the x-axis so we should get a positive answer.
What has gone wrong?
There are two types of integral which come under the name of
improper integrals. One is an integral in which one or both of the
limits of integration are inÔ¨Ånite, e.g.

In such an integral we are integrating over an unbounded interval.
The other type is where we integrate over a bounded interval but
the function which we are integrating is unbounded on this interval,

These areas may or may not be Ô¨Ånite.

But both integrals must converge. The reason we got a nonsensi-
cal answer at the start of the lecture was because neither integral
did converge. We were using an antiderivative which we weren‚Äôt
allowed to, because it wasn‚Äôt deÔ¨Åned at 0. Antiderivatives must be
deÔ¨Åned for every point in the interval we integrate over.

Calculus of Many Variables
Chapter 6
Calculus of Many
Variables
Calculus of many variables concerns functions f : Rn ‚ÜíRm be-
tween sets of vectors. Two important types of functions which fall
into this category are
‚Ä¢ scalar Ô¨Åelds which are functions f : Rn ‚ÜíR
‚Ä¢ vector Ô¨Åelds which are functions f : Rn ‚ÜíRn
This section generalises the single-variable calculus of functions
f : R ‚ÜíR and involves a mixture of techniques from single-variable
calculus and from linear algebra, the theory of vectors and matrices.
In each case when we express derivatives and partial derivatives of
these functions we will assume that the functions are suÔ¨Éciently
diÔ¨Äerentiable.
6.1
Surfaces and Partial Derivatives
The simplest case is a function f : R2 ‚ÜíR. Geometrically, this
can be viewed as a surface z = f(x, y).
Given such a surface
we can set y to be a constant y0, and this gives a function f(x),
which geometrically represents the cross section of the surface by

112 
Calculus of Many Variables
the plane y = y0. The gradient of this function f is then given by
d
dxf(x). Partial diÔ¨Äerentiation allows us to write down a function
of x and y such that this gradient is given at any point (x, y). All
we have to do is treat y as if it were a constant and diÔ¨Äerentiate
f(x, y) with respect to x to obtain a function denoted by ‚àÇf
‚àÇx or
fx(x, y), the partial derivative of f with respect to x. Similarly we
can deÔ¨Åne ‚àÇf
‚àÇy = fy(x, y).
Example 6.1.1 If f(x, y) = x2y + 2y2x3 then
‚àÇf
‚àÇx
=
2xy + 6y2x2
‚àÇf
‚àÇy
=
x2 + 4yx3

6.2
Scalar Fields
A scalar Ô¨Åeld, i.e. a function f : Rn ‚ÜíR, is something more general
than the surfaces from the previous section, although if we could
visualize more than three dimensions it would be a direct analogy
of a surface. Suppose that a scalar Ô¨Åeld be given by f(x1, . . . , xn).
Then we can deÔ¨Åne the gradient of f, which is denoted by ‚àáf and
is deÔ¨Åned by
‚àáf = (‚àÇf
x1
, . . . , ‚àÇf
xn
).
Or it may just be written as ‚àáf, but it is underlined here to remind
us that it is a vector operator. The gradient is a vector Ô¨Åeld, that
is a function Rn ‚ÜíRn. It has a geometric interpretation for n = 2:
the value of ‚àáf(x, y) at a point (x, y) is a vector pointing
in the direction where the surface slopes the most steeply
upwards
Example 6.2.1 If we take the function f(x, y) = x2y + 2y2x3 as
in the last section then
‚àáf(x, y) = (2xy + 6y2x2, x2 + 4yx3)
You might like to try to visualise this surface. For example, at
(x, y) = (1, 1), ‚àáf(x, y) = (8, 5). You might also like to consifer
what happens at (0, 0).
It is also possible to deÔ¨Åne the slope of the surface at (x, y) in any
direction. Suppose that ÀÜu is a unit vector (i.e. |ÀÜu| = 1). Then
the slope of the surface at (x, y) in the direction of ÀÜu is called
the directional derivative of f in the direction ÀÜu. We write it as
‚àáÀÜuf(x, y) and it is given by
‚àáÀÜuf(x, y) = ‚àáf(x, y) ¬∑ ÀÜu.

Vector Fields
Recall that a vector Ô¨Åeld is a function f : Rn ‚ÜíRn. It is more
commonly denoted by
v = (v1(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , vn(x1, . . . xn)).
We have already seen one example, the gradient of a scalar Ô¨Åeld.
If a vector Ô¨Åeld v can be obtained as v = ‚àáf for some scalar Ô¨Åeld
f then it is called a conservative Ô¨Åeld and f is called a (scalar)
potential for f. It will be apparent later why such Ô¨Åelds are called
conservative, when we study many-variable integration.
We can view vector Ô¨Åelds by showing the vector values on a grid
There are two commonly used diÔ¨Äerential operators on vector Ô¨Åelds,
the divergence and the curl of a vector Ô¨Åeld. The latter is deÔ¨Åned
in terms of the cross product and hence is only deÔ¨Åned on vector
Ô¨Åelds v : R3 ‚ÜíR3.
The divergence of a vector Ô¨Åeld v is a scalar Ô¨Åeld given by
div
div v = ‚àá¬∑ v = ‚àÇv1
x1
+ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ‚àÇvn
xn
The curl of a vector Ô¨Åeld v : R3 ‚ÜíR3, which will be written as
(vx(x, y, z), vy(x, y, z), vz(x, y, z))
is a vector Ô¨Åeld given by
curl v = ‚àá√ó v =
‚àÇvz
‚àÇy ‚àí‚àÇvy
‚àÇz , ‚àÇvx
‚àÇz ‚àí‚àÇvz
‚àÇx , ‚àÇvy
‚àÇx ‚àí‚àÇvx
‚àÇy

Curl has a nice interpretation. If you imagine the vector Ô¨Åeld as a
Ô¨Çuid, then the curl of the vector Ô¨Åeld at a point is the axis a ball
would spin around if it were inside the Ô¨Çuid at that point.

Jacobians and The Chain Rule
This section concerns functions f : Rn ‚ÜíRm for arbitrary m and
n. Such a function can be written as
f(x1, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , xn) = (f1(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , fm(x1, . . . , xn))
Given such a (diÔ¨Äerentiable) function we can write down an m √ó n
matrix of partial derivatives called the Jacobian matrix of f:
Jf =
Ô£Æ
Ô£ØÔ£∞
‚àÇf1
‚àÇx1

Recall the chain rule for functions f : R ‚ÜíR and g : R ‚ÜíR, that
d
dx(g(f(x)) = dg
dx (f(x)) ¬∑ df
dx(x)
In a very aesthetically pleasing way, this translates into something
about Jacobian matrices for functions f : Rn ‚ÜíRm where the
product in the ordinary chain rule is replaced by a matrix product.
Note that if g : Rm ‚ÜíRp then g ‚ó¶f : Rn ‚ÜíRp. Let a be a point
in Rn. Then
Theorem 6.4.1 (Multivariate Chain Rule)
J[g ‚ó¶f](a) = Jg(f(a))Jf(a).
Example 6.4.2 Let f(x, y) = (x + y, xy), f : R2 ‚ÜíR2, and let
g(x, y) = (x + y)2, g : R2 ‚ÜíR. Then
g ‚ó¶f(x, y) = (x + y + xy)2
We have
J[g ‚ó¶f](x, y)
=
‚àáT [g ‚ó¶f](x, y)
=
(2x + 2y + 4xy + 2y2 + 2xy2,

Line Integrals
A line integral is an integral done on a vector Ô¨Åeld. It has a physical
interpretation in the case where the Ô¨Åeld represents a force; the
value of the line integral is the work against the vector Ô¨Åeld in
moving from a point a to another point b. Line integrals are of the
form
 b
a
v ¬∑ dr
where v is a vector Ô¨Åeld, and r is a curve from a to b. It is not
easy to work with in this form; usually the curve is parameterized
as r(Œª) = (x(Œª), y(Œª), z(Œª)) for Œªa ‚©ΩŒª ‚©ΩŒªb. We can then write
down a function f : R ‚ÜíR
f(Œª) = v(x(Œª), y(Œª), z(Œª)) ¬∑ (x(Œª), y(Œª), z(Œª))
and treat it as a normal deÔ¨Ånite integral

A special case is where a = b and the integral is over a closed curve

In the case where v is a conservative Ô¨Åeld, the value of the line
integral only depends on the endpoints, not the curve r. It follows
that a circulation integral over a conservative Ô¨Åeld is always zero.

Surface and Volume Integrals
Analogous to line integrals, we can also deÔ¨Åne surface integrals and
volume integrals over a vector Ô¨Åeld. A surface integral looks like

S
v ¬∑ dS
where v is a vector Ô¨Åeld and S is a smooth surface. dS means the
rate of change of the normal vector to the surface S. A normal
vector to S at a point p on S is a vector perpendicular to the
tangent plane to S at p. Like with line integrals, it helps if we have
a of S parameterisation of S. A parameterisation of S takes the
form
s(Œª, ¬µ) = (x(Œª, ¬µ), y(Œª, ¬µ), z(Œª, ¬µ))
where Œª and ¬µ are real numbers. The normal is given by the cross
product
n(Œª, ¬µ) = sŒª(Œª, ¬µ) √ó s¬µ(Œª, ¬µ),
where
sŒª

We typically integrate over an area of the surface S demarcated
by allowing Œª and ¬µ to vary within intervals Œª ‚àà[Œªa, Œªb] and ¬µ ‚àà
[¬µa, ¬µb]. Thus, as with a line integral we can rephrase the surface
integral as some more easily understood real integrals

f(Œª, ¬µ)d¬µdŒª
where
f(Œª, ¬µ) = v(s(Œª, ¬µ)) ¬∑ n(Œª, ¬µ)

surface integral of the curl of a vector Ô¨Åeld in terms of a line integral

over the boundary of the surface. One word of warning. There are
in fact two possible normal vectors. A choice which varies smoothly
over the surface S is called an orientation of S. Not all surfaces
possess an orientation. If you are interested then google ‚Äúmobius
band‚Äù. In the following theorem C must be oriented in the same
way as S (otherwise there will be a sign error).
Theorem 6.6.1 (Stokes‚Äô Theorem) If S is a smooth ori-

Ordinary Differential Equations
Chapter 7
Ordinary DiÔ¨Äerential
Equations
DiÔ¨Äerential equations involve a function and its derivatives. The
solution to such an equation is not a number but a function. Dif-
ferential equations are important in engineering. There are many
kinds which can be solved algebraically but it is often not possible.
Linear equations are often more easily solved than nonlinear equa-
tions. There are also ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equations (ODE) and
partial diÔ¨Äerential equations (PDE). The solution to the former is
a function in one variable. The latter contain partial derivatives
and their solution is a function of more than one variable. We will
not cover partial diÔ¨Äerential equations in this text as they are a
topic in their own right.

d2y
dx2 + dy
dx ‚àí2y = 0
The characteristic equation is
p2 + p ‚àí2 = 0

The characteristic equation is p2 + 6p + 9 = 0

tions with Constant CoeÔ¨Écients:
The
Inhomogenous Case

dx + by = f(x)
To solve this type of equation we
1. Solve the corresponding homogenous equation, that is when
f(x) = 0, as in the previous section. This solution is called
the complementary function
2. Find a particular integral. We will shortly see how to do this.
3. Write down the general solution as complementary function

The second step in this process involves using a trial solution. De-
pending on the function f there are diÔ¨Äerent trial functions you
can use. The most common are as follows
f(x)

polynomial of degree n
polynomial of degree n
k sin x or k cos x
K cos x + L sin x

Note that the Ô¨Årst case includes

We found the complementary function in the last section, that is
y(x) = Ae‚àí2x + Bex.
A trial solution should be Kx2 + Lx + M. Substituting into the
diÔ¨Äerential equation, we get
2K + (2Kx + L) ‚àí2(Kx2 + Lx + M) = x2
Comparing coeÔ¨Écients of 1, x, x2 we get

supplied with enough information to determine the constants in
the solution (e.g. A and B in the previous section). Suppose that

we are also told that y(0) = 2 and dy

Recall that complex numbers are written z = x+iy where i2 = ‚àí1.
Suppose that we are given a complex function f : C ‚ÜíC, so that
w = f(z). Then in general we can write w = u(x, y) + iv(x, y). u
is the real part of f and v is the imaginary part of f. For example,
z2 = (x + iy)2 = x2 + 2xyi + i2y2 = (x2 ‚àíy2) + i(2xy)
So in this case, u(x, y) = x2 ‚àíy2 and v(x, y) = 2xy. We use power

By manipulating power series we can prove that certain identities
from the real case carry through to the complex case, such as:
ezew
=
ez+w
sin(‚àíz)
=
‚àísin z
cos(‚àíz)
=
cos z
sin(z + w)
=
sin z cos w + cos w sin z
cos(x + w)
=
cos z cos w ‚àísin z sin w
Most importantly we have Euler‚Äôs formula
eiz = cos z + i sin z
In particular for Œ∏ ‚ààR, eiŒ∏ = cos Œ∏ + i sin Œ∏ giving the famous
identity eiœÄ = ‚àí1, and de Moivre‚Äôs theorem
(cos Œ∏ + i sin Œ∏)n = cos nŒ∏ + i sin nŒ∏
Also, ez = ex+iy = exeiy gives
ez = ex(cos y + i sin y)
Thus |ez| = ex and Arg(ez) = y. It follows that ez, like its real
counterpart, is never equal to zero. Recall that the real function

sin is periodic. This means that there is a number 0 Ã∏= a ‚ààR with
sin(x + a) = sin x. The least such a is 2œÄ and is called the period
of sin. Since
ez+2œÄi = eze2œÄi = ez
we have the following fact
ez is periodic, with period 2œÄi.
So the complex function ez displays behaviour like both the real
exponential function and the real trigonometric functions.
We could also deÔ¨Åne the complex logarithm using a power series.
But it is more revealing to deÔ¨Åne it as the inverse of the exponential
function. Suppose that w ‚ààC satisÔ¨Åes ew = z. Let z = reiŒ∏ and
let w = u + iv. Then
ew = eu+iv = eueiv = reiŒ∏

So r = eu which gives u = log r, and eiv = eiŒ∏ implies that
v = Œ∏ + 2nœÄ for n ‚ààZ. That is,
log z = log r + i(Œ∏ + 2nœÄ), n ‚ààZ
Note that the complex logarithm is many-valued. If we restrict
to imaginary parts within the interval (‚àíœÄ, œÄ] we obtain what is
called the principal logarithm.
The complex logarithm allows us to deÔ¨Åne complex powers of com-
plex numbers. Since zw = elogzw = ew log z, this serves as a deÔ¨Åni-
tion:
zw = ew log z
For example, ii = ei log i = ei(i œÄ

2 .
There is also a simple ezpression for the complex sin and cos func-
tions. Recall the deÔ¨Ånitions of the hyperbolic functions
sinh x = 1
2(ex ‚àíe‚àíx), cosh x = 1
2(ex + e‚àíx)
from
eiz = cos z + i sin z, e‚àíiz = cos z ‚àíi sin z
we obtain
cos z = 1
2(eiz + e‚àíiz), sin z = 1
2i(eiz ‚àíe‚àíiz)
giving
cos(iy) = cosh y, sin(iy) = i sinh y
Since
sin z = sin(x + iy) = sin x cos(iy) + cos x sin(iy)

8.2
The Cauchy-Riemann Equations
There is a similar notion of diÔ¨Äerentiability for complex functions
to the one for real functions. f : C ‚ÜíC is diÔ¨Äerentiable at z ‚ààC
if the limit
lim
h‚Üí0
f(z + h) ‚àíf(z)
h

exists; if it does them the limit is called the derivative f‚Ä≤(z) = df
dz
of f at z.
The only diÔ¨Äerence from the real case is that h can
tend to 0 in any manner, i.e.
along any curve. By taking two
diÔ¨Äerent limits, in the direction of the real axis, and in the direction
of the imaginary axis, we obtain two diÔ¨Äerent expressions for the
derivative:
Let f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y). If f is diÔ¨Äerentiable at z =
(x, y) then
f‚Ä≤(z)
=
ux(x, y) + ivx(x, y)
=
vy(x, y) ‚àíiuy(x, y)
It follows that if f : C ‚ÜíC is diÔ¨Äerentiable then the following
partial diÔ¨Äerential equations hold for u and v.
The Cauchy-Riemann Equations
ux = vy, vx = ‚àíuy
Examples 8.2.1
1. Let f(z) = ¬Øz, the complex conjugate of
z. Then f(z) = x ‚àíiy which means that u(x, y) = x and
v(x, y) = ‚àíy.
Since ux = 1 and vy = ‚àí1, the Cauchy-
Riemann equations are not satisÔ¨Åed, so f is not diÔ¨Äerentiable.
2. Let f(z) = sin z = sin z cosh y + i cos x sinh y. Then we can
diÔ¨Äerentiate f to get
f‚Ä≤(z)
=
ux(x, y) + ivx(x, y)
=
cos x cosh y ‚àísin x sinh y
=
cos z

Check that you get the same answer using
f‚Ä≤(z) = vy(x, y) ‚àíiuy(x, y).
As an exercise, try to show that
d

d
dz(cos z) = ‚àísin z
and
d

z.
Recall that the partial diÔ¨Äerential equation ‚àá2u = uxx + uyy = 0
is called Laplace‚Äôs equation. If f is a diÔ¨Äerentiable complex func-
tion (whose components are suÔ¨Écently diÔ¨Äerentiable) then by the
Cauchy-Riemann equations,
uxx + uyy = vyx ‚àívxy = 0
Because by the theorem of mixed partial derivatives vyx = vxy.
Thus u (and similarly v) is a solution to Laplace‚Äôs equation, what
is called a harmonic function. If two harmonic functions are the
real and imaginary parts of a complex function then they are called
harmonic conjugates.
Example 8.2.2 Let u(x, y) = x3 ‚àí3xy2.
Then uxx = 6x and
uyy = ‚àí6x so u is harmonic. To Ô¨Ånd a harmonic conjugate v for
u we solve the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We have vy = ux =
3x2 ‚àí3y2 and vx = ‚àíuy = 6xy. From the second of these,
v(x, y) =

vxdx = 3x2y + g(y).
DiÔ¨Äerentiating with respect to y, we obtain vy = 3x2+g‚Ä≤(y), giving
g‚Ä≤(y) = ‚àí3y2. So g(y) = ‚àíy3 + c for any constant c. Taking c = 0
gives v(x, y) = 3x2y ‚àíy3. Hence
f(z)

x3 ‚àí3xy2 + i(3x2y ‚àíy3)

Complex Integrals
In this Ô¨Ånal section we will only touch on the ideas of complex
integration. Complex integrals are similar to line integrals, that
is they are performed on a curve in the complex plane. In this
context the curve is usually called a contour. It is often convenient
to parameterize using the complex exponential.
Example 8.3.1
1. Let C be the circle |z| = r, with centre
a ‚ààC parameterized in an anticlockwise direction.
Then
z = a + reiŒ∏ on C, for 0 ‚©ΩŒ∏ ‚©Ω2œÄ. We wish to evaluate

Theorem 8.3.2 (Cauchy‚Äôs Integral Formula) Let f

any simple closed contour C which encloses (but doesn‚Äôt pass
through) the point a ‚ààC. Then

Cauchy‚Äôs integral formula is very powerful - it allows us to integrate
most contour integrals in terms of the value of the function we
are integrating at a singularity (given that we can express it as a
function with a Taylor series (called an analytic function divided
by z. But you might ask
‚Ä¢ What happens for a function which can be expressed by a
Taylor series (without having to divide by z)?
‚Ä¢ What about functions divided by other powers of z?
In the Ô¨Årst case we simply get 0. You can look at this two ways.
Firstly the computation above with, say, ez instead of ez
z will clearly
give 0. On the other hand complex functions can be thought of as
vector Ô¨Åelds R2 ‚ÜíR2. In the analytic case, they correspond to
conservative Ô¨Åelds. We don‚Äôt have room here for the details, but
to address the second point you can do a similar calculation which
results in the following generalized formula.
Theorem 8.3.3 Let C and f be as in the statement of
Cauchy‚Äôs integral formula. Then

(z ‚àía)k dz = 2œÄif(k‚àí1)(a)
(k ‚àí1)!
Here, f(k‚àí1) denotes the (k ‚àí1)th derivative of f.
All of these ideas lead up to the most powerful theorem for comput-
ing complex integrals, called the Theorem of Residues. If you learn
any theorem about complex integrals then learn this one! It basi-
cally says that we can evaluate a complex integral by computing

the function we are integrating.
Suppose that

where g is diÔ¨Äerentiable on and inside a circle of radius r > 0
about a. Then

the residue at the pole a.
