About the Author
Lisa Swallow is a professor, CPA, CMA, community volunteer, and writer 
based in Missoula, Montana. She takes an active role in many aspects of her 
local green business community, including consulting with local businesses 
and serving as a board member on the Sustainable Business Council and 
Sustainable Campus Committee. Lisa is also a past board member and presi-
dent of homeWORD, a nonprofi t that develops affordable green housing and 
advocates for best-practice policies in housing.
She co-writes a column on the green global economy, which appears the 
fi rst of each month in the “In Business” section of her local newspaper, The 
Missoulian. She has also written chapters on sustainable marketing and sus-
tainable business for a leading Principles of Business textbook.
Lisa is at the forefront of promoting sustainability literacy curriculum at 
the University of Montana and teaches two classes adopted into UM’s inter-
disciplinary Climate Change Studies minor. She is the Program Director for 
Accounting Technology at UM College of Technology and integrates sustain-
able business concepts into all the courses she teaches.
She has long been an advocate that the economy, the environment, and 
social justice can all be well-served by smart, strategic business thinking 
that focuses on long-term solutions rather than solely on short-term prof-
its. In 2005, she discovered the exemplary Bainbridge Graduate Institute on 
Bainbridge Island, Washington — one of the fi rst institutions of higher educa-
tion in the U.S. to offer course work with an emphasis in sustainable develop-
ment. Lisa received a graduate certifi cate in Sustainable Business from BGI in 
2006. She also has a Master of Science in Accountancy from California State 
University, Chico.

Dedication
To my best friend and lifetime partner, Dann Swallow, for his unwavering sup-
port and belief in my ability to complete this project, and to my teenagers, 
Dylan and Dante, for all the times I had to say, “I’m writing — catch me later!” 
Also, to my Texas family members for their unequivocal enthusiasm for this 
project, even when mine had dwindled.

Author’s Acknowledgments
“Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”
— William Butler Yeats
Writing a book about something I feel so passionate about has been 
extremely rewarding — the incessant educator in me has found an outlet that 
many folks only get to image.
I’m blessed to work with hundreds of students every year. Their eager minds, 
desire to be a part of the solution to the challenges facing our world, and 
insightful and provocative questions drive me to be the best that I can be in 
order to inspire their generation toward creative and sustainable thinking.
This book would have been unthinkable fi ve short years ago. My deepest 
gratitude goes out to Gifford and Libba Pinchot for their vision of a business 
school (Bainbridge Graduate Institute) that embraces environmental and 
social responsibility and to Jill Bamburg for inspiring me from the fi rst day I 
landed there. I’d also like to thank Eric Ziegler, a fellow student at BGI, who 
got my foot in the door for my fi rst writing gig on sustainability.
The research on sustainable business is exploding, and I can’t begin to thank 
all the professionals and scholars whose work I relied on to guide, solidify, 
and inspire my work. I’m in awe of many of the creative entrepreneurs and 
managers who are positioning their companies to fl ourish in the face of sig-
nifi cant global challenges. Without your success stories, there would be no 
case for a sustainable business model.
On a personal level, I want to thank my dear friend, Niki Robinson, for help-
ing me redirect my career and research when I was fl oundering. Her insight 
helped me to think holistically about how to bring together my passion 
for the environment and social justice with my long-term profession as an 
accountant and businesswoman.
Lastly, this book would never have gotten off my computer and into print 
if it weren’t for the ceaseless prodding, cajoling, and counseling of Kristin 
DeMint, my project editor. I’d also like to give a big shout out to Mike Baker 
at Wiley for being so receptive to my ideas for the book, as well as to Jen 
Tebbe for her editorial comments, corrections, and ideas. This book was a 
collaborative effort, to say the least, and would never have come together 
without true partnering.

(considering all stakeholders — people, planet, and profit — rather than just 
shareholders), Green Business Practices For Dummies can be your how-to guide.
Converting a company to a sustainable business model is largely a matter of 
transformative thinking — looking at how to accomplish economic goals in a 
way that recognizes and respects the constraints of the planet. Some of the 
resulting action items are easy to implement; others aren’t so easy. But the 
beauty of starting to think and act sustainably is that the ripple effect of both 
becomes apparent pretty quickly: Employees start offering creative, green 
ideas; external partners see your progress and hop on the green bandwagon; 
and customers query you about your new green ethos and how that will 
impact new products and processes.
If achieving sustainability is a journey (and it is!), then by virtue of buying 
this book, you’re now on the green path. I commend you for taking the ini-
tiative to become informed on sustainable business and for all the small, 
yet significant, steps you’ll take in the future as a result of this information. 
Although no one can predict how your unique business can take advantage 
of the opportunities inherent in sustainable development, I can promise you 
one thing: You’ll never have felt so great about going to work in the morning 
as you will when you truly become a disciple of triple-bottom-line thinking!
About This Book
The purpose of this book is to give you guidance on how to think about busi-
ness decisions, strategies, products/services, and policies within a wider, 
greener lens. Sound like a tall order while trying to generate profits to stay 
alive another day? There’s no single guiding model as to what a green busi-
ness should look like. But there are great stories of companies that have 
embraced sustainable development and flourished in ways they’d never imag-
ined (think GE, Patagonia, Dow Chemical, IKEA, Volvo, and Herman Miller).
Green Business Practices For Dummies is not only going to convince you that 
greening your business is important but it’s also going to show you exactly 
how to do that. This book provides examples, tangible action items, check-
lists, ideas, and frameworks that you can use to develop your own unique

Green Business Practices For Dummies 
spin on greening your organization in a way that makes sense for you, your 
employees, and your operating environment. It offers you salient how-to 
advice on topics like
 
✓ Creating a sustainability plan
 
✓ Motivating employees through ecoefforts
 
✓ Strengthening your sustainable marketing endeavors
 
✓ Greening your daily office practices
I wrote this book primarily for all the small and mid-sized business owners 
and managers I know and work with who want to embrace green business 
practices but don’t know where to start or what that really even means. 
Green Business Practices For Dummies contains tons of information about 
ways you can make your unique business greener — and gain a competitive 
advantage in the process.
Conventions Used in This Book
All For Dummies books employ similar conventions for a sense of continuity 
and familiarity. Here’s what the following conventions alert you to:
 
✓ Web addresses appear in a typeface called monofont. If the URL wraps 
to a second line of text, type the address in exactly how it’s presented. 
Hyphens are inserted only when they’re included in the Web address.
 
✓ Bold text indicates key words, phrases, or concepts and makes critical 
pieces of info easy to find.
 
✓ When a new term is introduced, it appears in italics and is followed by 
an explanatory phrase or sentence.
Also, as you go through the book, you’ll notice I use the phrases green busi-
ness practices and sustainable business practices interchangeably in order to 
heighten your awareness that different people you encounter throughout 
your greening process will use different terminology. Don’t worry that you’re 
missing out on anything though. Both phrases mean the exact same thing.
What You’re Not to Read
The main text is full of relevant, helpful tips, ideas, lists, and specifics for 
greening your small or mid-sized business, so don’t miss one juicy word! On 
the other hand, the Technical Stuff icon indicates ecodata or other techie 
details that you can safely skip and still get the complete gist of the book. If, 

3
 Introduction
however, techie talk is your cup of green tea, be sure to check out the para-
graphs marked with this icon.
The sidebars contain information that’s supplementary and relevant, but not 
absolutely imperative to greening your business. You can skip these bits of 
info without missing an ecobeat and still have lots of practical suggestions in 
your grab bag.
Foolish Assumptions
Any businessperson knows to keep the client foremost in mind, and an 
author is no different. So as I wrote this book for you, I made the following 
assumptions about you and your organization:
 
✓ Your first priority is to stay in business and to do that you must remain 
solvent and profitable.
 
✓ You’re concerned with your company’s impact on the environment and 
want to do all you can to reduce that footprint.
 
✓ You value your stakeholders — employees, customers, communities, 
creditors, owners, and suppliers — and want to contribute to their 
overall well-being through your business’s efforts.
 
✓ You believe that lots of small changes add up to big impact and are 
ready to take on the role of change agent in your organization.
 
✓ You understand that the media, as well as Wall Street, are on the 
ecobandwagon and want to know how to take advantage of the oppor-
tunities inherent in that.
 
✓ You find yourself wary of putting your works up on a pedestal and are 
heartily committed to self-reflection to ensure your ecosteps remain 
true to your company’s mission and sustainability goals.
 
✓ You perceive sustainability to be a good business strategy, even though 
you may not be able to define it.
How This Book Is Organized
Green Business Practices For Dummies is organized into five parts and 
designed so that you can easily read any part by itself and feel fully informed 
on that topic without any other background. Take a gander at the following 
overview and then dive on in depending on your individual interests.

4
Green Business Practices For Dummies 
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary 
Way to Grow a Business
Chapter 1 introduces you to the business case for sustainability and addresses 
why sustainability is not only a good business model but also one that’ll prevail 
in years to come. It also explains how your company can get onboard. Chapter 
2 gives you an overview of the most challenging issues facing businesses 
today, identifies how these situations were created, and guides you in navigat-
ing these new waters. Chapter 3 shows you what it means to think like an eco-
minded businessperson and helps you identify other like-minded individuals in 
order to build a green team to lead your sustainability efforts. It also explains 
the key frameworks that guide green business strategies. Chapter 4 helps you 
develop a very important document — your company’s sustainability plan! It 
walks you through the process of conducting a SWOT analysis to assess your 
business’s current state of sustainability and then leads you through crafting 
long-term goals, initiatives to reach them, and indicators to measure them. 
Chapter 5 explains the regulatory pressures and policymakers that are influ-
encing sustainable development in the commercial world and how you can 
make your voice heard.
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: 
Implementation
Part II gets you started with the nuts ’n’ bolts of greening your organization. 
Although every company begins its sustainability efforts in the area that 
makes the most sense for that individual organization, many companies start 
by looking at their daily office practices, their product development and 
production processes, and the physical facilities that house their operations. 
There are many financial aspects and transactions in your business that offer 
green opportunity as well. The four chapters in this part offer you practical 
guidance on how to approach tangible action items for each of these areas.
Part III: Involving Stakeholders 
in Your Sustainability Efforts
This part takes your sustainability efforts out into the world and aids you in 
greening business relationships with your key stakeholders. Chapter 10 helps 
you identify which of your customers, distribution channels, and messaging 
methods are most appropriate to change. Marketing is a critical area to get 
right because of the inordinate amount of misleading green information out

 Introduction
there. Educating your customers through your marketing initiatives is thus a 
core component of a sustainable business. Chapter 11 helps you see how to 
develop community relationships to enhance your sustainability efforts by 
encouraging other like-minded organizations to gather together and harvest 
the triple-bottom-line effects of the buy-local movement that’s sweeping the 
U.S. Chapter 12 guides you through the process of finding, forming, and nur-
turing relationships with nonprofits in order to expand your scope of influ-
ence. Finally, Chapter 13 outlines how to develop your employees, as well as 
your human resource policies and procedures, in a sustainable manner. The 
info in this chapter is absolutely essential because the core of your sustain-
able development resides with your employees.
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results
Making huge green strides means little without a way to measure and com-
municate your results, so Part IV walks you through how to do just that. 
Chapter 14 introduces you to the standards that are being established for 
different aspects of greening your business, as well as some overarching 
ecocertifications you can apply for. Chapter 15 introduces you to ways of 
accumulating and conveying data in order to measure your sustainability 
progress. For companies that are pretty far down the green path, Chapter 16 
leads you through how to design, write, and distribute a sustainability report 
that both informs and impresses your key stakeholders.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book contains this part, which features a couple enter-
taining and informative lists of tens. Turn to Chapter 17 to gather inspiration 
from the success stories of (more than) ten truly green corporate visionaries. 
(I promise you, one look at this list to see how ordinary people have accom-
plished extraordinary sustainable business goals, and you’ll be feeling inspired 
about where your business can go.) Chapter 18 highlights ten common myths 
people have about sustainable business practices; it also arms you with good 
ways of refuting these myths in a gentle and articulate manner.

Part I
Sustainability: The 
Visionary Way to 
Grow a Business

In this part . . .
A
 potent part of moving toward a sustainable world is 
the greening of the business model, a process that 
requires businesses to not only meet today’s commercial 
goals but also consider how they’ll flourish in the future in 
the face of many global challenges and changes. This type 
of consideration involves carefully crafting a plan that will 
guide your greening efforts from start to finish. It also 
requires you to keep abreast of the ever-evolving public 
policies related to sustainability.
In this part, I provide an overview of the most compelling 
issues facing commerce in the 21st century and examine 
why sustainable business makes so much sense. I also 
help you with the sustainability-planning process, from 
doing the background work necessary to create your plan 
to communicating your plan to key stakeholders. Finally, I 
show you how to navigate the sustainable public policy 
realm.

Chapter 1
What’s in It for My Company; 
What’s in It for My World?
In This Chapter
▶ Delving into what sustainable development really means
▶ Defining the environmental and social challenges shaping today’s world
▶ Identifying how your company can benefit from green business practices
▶ Seeing how going green creates value and opportunity for your company
M
ajor newspapers announce that “green is the new black,” and adver-
tisements encourage consumers to “get their green on.” TV entices 
viewers to use their ecoimaginations, and bumper stickers implore drivers to 
“live locally, think globally.” Phrases like carbon neutral and global warming 
are becoming everyday terms. Being bombarded with all this different media 
challenges people to look at their homes, cars, schools, food, and businesses 
with a new sense of how to live on this Earth a bit lighter.
Your business has probably experienced some shifts in the availability and 
pricing of natural resources of late. Perhaps you see that continued reliance 
on increasingly expensive fossil fuels puts your business at long-term risk. 
Combined with stakeholders, regulators, customers, and markets that are 
becoming more sophisticated about the green movement, the imperative to 
revisit your old business model has never been stronger. On the flip side, the 
opportunities for doing so have never been greater either.
You may have heard about various organizations “going green” in recent years, 
but the paradigm shift, as a whole, is still in its infancy. (Although some say 
the Green Revolution’s impact on daily life will dwarf the changes caused by 
the Industrial and Information Revolutions combined.) Adapting to a new, 
green business model takes both radically fresh ways of thinking (in long-
term, systems-based ways) and innovative methods for measuring success.

Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
For companies that get it, so to speak, the rewards can be substantial — for 
people, the planet, and your organization’s profitability. But before you can 
reap those rewards, it helps to know why taking the plunge into green business 
practices (also known as sustainable business practices) is worthwhile — 
and even necessary — and how exactly they can add to your company’s 
overall value.
Looking at the Three Ps of Sustainability
Most business managers and owners have some ideas about what sustain-
ability is, but often can’t define it. Perhaps you yourself are hard-pressed to 
characterize what a sustainable business is, or to identify specific actions 
you can take to green your own company. You have a vague sense that you 
should be doing just that — you’re just not sure how to add “go green” to 
your to-do list. Never fear! The time has come to demystify this process and 
start you down the path to increasing both your profits and your contribu-
tions to the planet and its people.
 
Sustainability is generally defined as meeting your current needs while allow-
ing future generations the capacity to meet theirs. Painstakingly simply, right? 
Sustainable development acknowledges that your company’s commercial 
achievement is intricately linked to ecological and social successes. The driv-
ing idea behind sustainability is that humans can’t deplete the Earth’s natural 
capital (water, minerals, soil, and the like) faster than its capacity to regener-
ate because eventually those natural resources are going to run out. Business 
not only needs to operate within natural capital’s constraints but it also must 
acknowledge the potential it has to serve as a restorative force to mitigate the 
problems of the past.
Companies are realizing that three equally important and interrelated bottom 
lines each need to be maximized to achieve true long-term sustainability. 
This triumvirate is now recognized as the triple bottom line (also referred 
to in some circles as TBL, Triple E, or the Three Ps). Coined in 1994 by John 
Elkington, the triple bottom line captures the idea that a sustainable business 
considers the needs of all stakeholders (including other species) instead of 
solely maximizing profit for shareholders. Here’s how all the various termi-
nology relates:

Equity 
Human capital

Environment

11
 Chapter 1: What’s in It for My Company; What’s in It for My World?
 
The triple bottom line is made up of the following:
 
✓ People: Business viability requires healthy communities, strong supplier 
connections, empowered employees, and sound customer relationships. 
Consequently, a business that wants to succeed sustainably must have a 
heightened commitment to providing products or services that comply 
with social norms and rules while contributing to an enhanced quality of 
life for all stakeholders.
 
✓ Planet: A company that strives to keep this category in mind offers 
products or services that contribute to the rejuvenation of the Earth’s 
ecosystems. It includes sustainability as a core element of its business 
plan and adapts to the planet’s new challenges. A planet-focused busi-
ness also identifies ways to mitigate some of the problems caused by 
past actions (climate change, pollution, overflowing landfills, and so on). 
Steps some businesses are taking to lighten their impact on the planet 
include decreasing waste flows and reducing their use of energy and 
other nonrenewable resources.
 
✓ Profit: Of course, a company must generate profit and cash flow in order 
to remain solvent and continue its operations. Triple-bottom-line strat-
egy shows the deep interconnectedness of long-term profitability, strong 
relationships with people, and a commitment to improving the planet. For 
example, conducting business in a green facility improves employee pro-
ductivity and health and decreases energy and water bills, thereby improv-
ing your company’s bottom line. Additionally, offering ecofriendly products 
and services as solutions to problems and authentic needs creates satis-
fied customers, which ultimately results in increased profitability from an 
expanded product or service line that operates within nature’s constraints.
Figure 1-1 shows the intersection of the three elements of sustainability 
(people, planet, and profit). As you can see, a deep interrelationship exists 
between your organization’s financial success and the health of the planet 
and its people.

Considering the Need and Opportunity 
for Change from a Business Perspective
Because of the tremendous challenges facing the global village, your business 
may be looking toward sustainable development as a way to position itself 
for the future. Now is definitely the time to reduce future risk, increase your 
access to capital, realize opportunities inherent in green innovation, cut costs 
through ecoefficiencies, and show your stakeholders that you’re positioned 
to be a player in the emerging green market. Why? Because all three kinds of 
capital necessary for commerce — natural, human, and financial (see the pre-
ceding section) — are changing in response to the new business paradigm.
Businesses need materials to operate, and many of these natural resources 
are either running out or becoming much more expensive to extract. Consum-
ers are adjusting their decisions and habits in response to increased environ-
mental concerns and energy worries, and businesses need to react quickly 
to these purchasing-pattern shifts in order to take advantage of this opportu-
nity. Formal market mechanisms integral to capitalism — such as how insur-
ance policies are rated and priced, how access to capital is granted, and what 
sorts of environmental and social issues are regulated — are shifting dramati-
cally as well. That’s why today’s not too late to start the process of thinking 
and acting sustainably. Fortunately, you can do so with minimal effort by 
reviewing the factors I highlight in the following sections.
Crucial resources are dwindling
Almost all businesses rely on some sort of natural capital, so one of the big-
gest economic concerns for your business may be the nagging reminder that 
the natural resources and raw materials you need to operate are becoming 
more expensive and difficult to source. You probably don’t need to look far-
ther than your utility bills to see this truth in action!
One of the easiest ways to understand natural capital and its limits is to think 
of a trust fund. You have a chunk of change that’s generating income. All’s 
well — as long as you’re living off of the interest that the fund is earning. The 
minute you start to spend down the principal, you’re on a potentially slip-
pery slope because the interest you’ll receive next period will be less. Less 
interest means that next month you’ll have to dip into more principal to con-
tinue your current level of consumption, thereby accelerating the depletion 
of your trust fund.
When it comes to the planet’s natural capital, society has dipped pretty heav-
ily into its trust fund. The various ecosystem services (such as pollination, 
water filtration, and flood control) that the Earth so generously provides 
for free are a result of natural capital. Although Mother Nature charitably 

13
 Chapter 1: What’s in It for My Company; What’s in It for My World?
produces minerals, groundwater, and fertile topsoil, she doesn’t do it very 
quickly. Thanks to the pace of technological innovation, humanity’s rate of 
consumption has increased much more rapidly than the planet’s ability to 
support it.
 
Particularly in the United States, but in a growing number of other highly 
populated countries as well, people engage in a disposable-resource-intensive 
lifestyle. In fact, according to the ecological footprint model developed by 
Mathis Wackernagel and William Reese, mankind requires nearly one and a 
half planets to support its current level of activity, with some western nations 
living as if the Earth contained six or seven planets’ worth of resources. Yikes!
 
For your business to flourish in the long term, you need to be prepared for the 
changes in access to natural capital. Thinking about reducing your company’s 
reliance on fresh water, fossil fuels (particularly expensive foreign oil), and 
virgin raw materials today will help you prepare for the future. Companies 
that aren’t actively acknowledging and planning for change in the global busi-
ness model may find that they aren’t positioned to take advantage of the 
various opportunities this model presents (like designing products that use 
recycled materials).
Key stakeholders are a-changin’
As access to affordable natural capital diminishes and education about envi-
ronmental and social problems increases, key stakeholders in commerce are 
becoming much more astute, proactive, and demanding. I clue you in to these 
stakeholders from the larger entities on down to individuals in the following 
sections.
Government and regulators
You’re probably already well aware, but policymakers at federal, state, and 
local levels are influencing how you conduct business.
 
✓ Tax incentives are being employed extensively to encourage the devel-
opment of renewable energy, waste-reduction systems, green buildings, 
and water/energy conservation initiatives.
 
✓ Additional tax burdens are in the works for carbon emissions and waste-
stream creation (and in fact, they already exist for pollution).
 
✓ Trade policies are being created to encourage local economic develop-
ment, alternative fuel creation, and other sustainably oriented projects.
Companies that are pursuing sustainability are no longer satisfied with 
simple regulatory compliance. Instead, they’re constantly being proactive 
with policy and taking a leadership role in developing new methods for 
reducing regulatory burden by greatly exceeding expectations.

14
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Activist shareholders
They’re passionate about the environment, they’re educated, and they hold 
shares of stock in your business. In recent years, activist shareholders have 
driven many companies to go green and stop certain nonsustainable activi-
ties, so you can easily imagine how you might one day be affected by them, if 
you haven’t been already.
Institutional shareholder activism in particular is on the rise, with big players 
demanding that companies disclose their carbon exposure, environmental 
records, and labor practices. Although this scenario may be far up the feed-
ing chain from your organization, trickledown occurs quickly. Look for the 
trend to continue and filter down to the many small and mid-sized companies 
that provide products and services to the larger multinational corporations.
 
If you’re part of a smaller organization that supplies the big guys, you may 
have a great chance to position your company as a sustainable vendor on 
their supply chain lists. You benefit from a steady stream of business, and 
your customers benefit from telling their shareholders that they’re greening 
their supply chain. In short, everyone wins — people, planet, and profit.
Consumers
Decreasing thermostat temperature, turning off electronics when not in use, 
and flipping off lights when not in a room are the most common of American 
consumers’ modest behavior changes, according to the Natural Marketing 
Institute, which tracks green behavior patterns. But these changes are affect-
ing more than just household behaviors — they’re increasing the demand 
for products with green attributes. Need proof? Fifty percent of Americans 
polled by Information Resources say that they consider at least one sustain-
ability factor when making purchases.
People are simultaneously looking for ways to insulate their pocketbooks 
from escalating natural resource prices and align their purchasing behavior 
with their newly green values. Hence the resurgence in local commerce and 
green purchasing (and the downfall of conspicuous consumption — buying 
fancy objects to show off your wealth or status).
Consumer demographics can be stratified to the nth degree, but a good start-
ing point is to look at the three major categories of green consumers:
 
✓ Pine Greens: These uber-informed consumers are astute and sophisti-
cated about market niches such as ecotourism and whole foods. What’s 
more, they’re growing in number after stagnating for many years.
 
 Pine Greens are also identified under a more formal market demo-
graphic known as LOHAS, or the Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability 
sector. An estimated 60 to 70 million Americans who actively support 
green and ethical businesses and products fall into this category. LOHAS 
consumers purchase products primarily because of their healthful and 

15
 Chapter 1: What’s in It for My Company; What’s in It for My World?
sustainable attributes, and they spend more than $200 billion annually 
on green goods and services, an amount that’s expected to double in 
size by 2010 and quadruple in size by 2015. (LOHAS spending is still a 
spot on the wall compared to annual consumer spending of $10 trillion, 
but the speed at which it’s growing is what’s garnering attention.)
 
✓ Jungle Greens: Trendy and ecofriendly, the Jungle Greens will grow in 
number in the coming years. Why? Because they’re professional, edu-
cated, have disposable income, and are hearing a lot about green these 
days in the popular media.
 
✓ Moss Greens: At the bottom of the green buying chain, Moss Greens 
(the environmentally apathetic consumers) are either unconcerned with 
social and ecological issues or unmotivated to change their behaviors or 
spend money on sustainable products and services. They typically only 
enter the green marketplace in search of ways to stretch their dollars, 
such as seeking out energy savings.
 
As for what consumers consider when deciding whether to purchase a partic-
ular good or service, the following three factors play a huge role:
 
✓ The product/service itself: How a product performs, the quality of a ser-
vice, and the price of that product or service are still strong motivators 
in your customers’ purchasing decisions. On the other hand, factors 
such as a product’s amount of packaging, recyclability, and whether it 
came from virgin raw materials are important considerations for more 
and more consumers all the time.
 
✓ The seller’s and/or manufacturer’s practices: Four out of five 
Americans agree that companies need to be not only profitable but 
also mindful of their impact on the environment and society. More 
consumers are punishing companies they’d previously purchased their 
products from by switching brands after hearing about a business’s 
sweatshop labor practices or its relocation of manufacturing facilities to 
a country with sparse environmental laws. The effect is often immediate 
when a company’s poor corporate social responsibility (CSR) is publicly 
spotlighted. (CSR refers to pursuing commercial success while empha-
sizing your company’s environmental and social contributions.)
 
 In recent years, this negative publicity has been primarily due to the spate 
of media about abhorrent business ethics, sweatshop labor, out-of-control 
executive salaries, and excessive profits at the pump. In contrast, Whole 
Foods (a sustainable grocery chain that caps executive salaries at 19 
times the lowest earner, features organic food, and sports a strong corpo-
rate citizenship profile) has experienced phenomenal growth over the last 
decade, whereas most grocery store sales have remained fairly flat.
 
✓ The origin of the product: Many consumers these days prefer to buy 
regional or local goods. The business model of days gone by relied on 
extremely cheap oil to transport items back and forth across the ocean 
for production in order to exploit inexpensive labor. Nowadays, consumer 

16
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
concerns about huge trade deficits, unsafe products from foreign coun-
tries, and the loss of many local businesses are creating the renais-
sance of farmers’ markets, community finance, and local shops that 
provide building supplies, clothes, crafts, and household items. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture tracks farmers’ markets and shows an almost 
19 percent increase nationally in the last decade, which illustrates the 
phenomenal growth of a distribution channel that’s making locally 
grown food very accessible.
As you can see, the opportunities for taking advantage of this growing con-
sumer shift are vast. Just check out Table 1-1, which shows the growing 
green presence in almost every industry sector, to see where your organiza-
tion may be able to find its green niche.

Traditionally, access to capital has been based on short-term profitability 
projections, usually presented on a quarterly basis. You present your cash 
flow projections to a lender, and the lender grants credit based on those 
forecasts. For investments to produce sustainable yields in the long term, 
however, you need to conduct a thorough internal review of all of your com-
pany’s environmental and social impacts. This internal analysis may turn up 
potentially litigious areas and identify places to cut costs through ecoefficien-
cies, thus increasing your business’s long-term solvency potential.

Sustainable business practices equate with proactive risk management in 
the eyes of investors, creditors, and financiers. In addition to understanding 
financial returns, these sources of capital increasingly want to know how 
your business is positioned to respond to environmental and social chal-
lenges. I delve into these subjects in more detail in the following sections.
Increasing access to capital
Four of the United States’ biggest banks (Citigroup, Bank of America, 
JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) and 60 institutions worldwide have 
adopted the Equator Principles. These voluntary principles help financial 
institutions manage the environmental and social risks of their projects 
and give equal consideration to each aspect of the triple bottom line when 
making financing choices (see the “Looking at the Three Ps of Sustainability” 
section, earlier in this chapter, for more on the triple bottom line).
 
Capital sources are actively asking investees about how they’re prepared 
for a carbon-constrained future. The next time you apply for a line of credit 
or a loan, or find an underwriter for your equity offering, be ready to answer 
questions regarding your renewable energy goals or energy-efficiency targets. 
Look for loan applications to ask about your environmental performance and 
benchmarks and internal lines of accountability for triple-bottom-line perfor-
mance. Not considering these questions may make you less competitive for 
capital. If you run a nonprofit, you may have noticed that many grants are now 
including allocable points based on your sustainability efforts. Again, if these 
are issues you haven’t even considered, you may find yourself losing funding 
from previously stable revenue streams.
 
Want to diverge from the traditional funding routes? Then you’ll be glad to 
know that institutions are sprouting up specifically for the purpose of financ-
ing ecoentrepreneurs. New Resource Bank and ShoreBank Pacific are early 
examples of such lending institutions. If you’re considering green product 
development or sustainable expansion, these are the capital sources for you.
Ensuring that you stay insured at a price you can afford
Controlling insurance costs is yet another benefit of sustainable busi-
ness practices. Some of the items that the United Nations Environmental 
Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI, a global partnership between the UN 
and the financial sector) considers to be the most critical in terms of risk and 
protection in the 21st century include
 
✓ Climate change
 
✓ Environmental liability
 
✓ Man-made risks
 
✓ Recycling

The UNEP FI report details the challenges and opportunities inherent in a busi-
ness’s transition to sustainability from an insurer’s perspective. One thread 
emerges clearly and is very pertinent to businesspeople: Insurability will increas-
ingly be linked to internal evidence that a company understands its environmen-
tal and social risks and is developing ways to mitigate them. If you’re not, you may 
face difficulties keeping your company insured down the road.
Recognizing the growing importance of socially responsible investing
Socially responsible investing (an investing model that takes environmental 
and social factors into account, in addition to traditional financial analysis) 
is becoming far more mainstream — resulting in an infusion of billions of 
new dollars into environmentally and socially just organizations. Investors 
now have a multitude of places to look if they’re interested in greening 
their investment portfolios. Following are some of the main green investing 
opportunities to date to help you better understand this shift toward socially 
responsible investing:
 
✓ Trading markets dedicated to sustainability: The sophisticated needs 
of green investors are now being met by the Dow Jones Sustainability 
North America Index, which tracks the leading 20 percent of the 600 big-
gest North American companies in the World Index in terms of sustain-
ability. In early 2009, the Green Exchange will offer trading capacity for 
environmental products designed to deal with pollution and alternative 
energy and offset climate change damage.
 
✓ Green mutual funds: At their investors’ requests, almost all major mutual 
fund families are adding a green fund that offers investors opportunities to 
embrace the environment, help eradicate poverty, or contribute to climate 
change adaptation and mitigation. From small cap green sector funds to 
climate change funds based on global warming indices, the focus is on com-
panies that can offer solutions to the major challenges facing today’s world. 
Some of these funds focus on clean energy, some on the largest clean tech 
companies, and some on community participation and human rights.
 
✓ Clean tech venture capital: The nature of clean tech (or green tech) 
investing is that it requires highly specialized technology, lots and lots 
of start-up capital, and technically adept employees. Following are the 
five broad categories of clean tech investing:
 
• Renewable energy production, storage, and distribution
 
• Air quality monitoring and purification
 
• Water quality monitoring and purification
 
• Waste control, capture, and conversion to fuel
 
• Sustainable products that reduce energy and manage resources
 
 Clean tech start-ups backed by venture capital have doubled in value 
between 2005 and 2007. If you want to take advantage of clean tech ven-
ture capital, plug that phrase into your web browser and see what pops

 Chapter 1: What’s in It for My Company; What’s in It for My World?
up that’s regionally appropriate. Then check out the venture capital 
source’s Web site for business plan submission guidelines.
 
✓ Green angel investors: High-net-worth individuals who primarily invest 
in start-up companies are considered angel investors. They pool their 
money and invest in projects that are too small for traditional venture 
capital backing, and their number is growing. Money from green angel 
investors is finding its way into small social ventures and diverse areas 
such as media, healthcare, organic food, and renewable energy. Try 
doing an Internet search for “green angel capital” and your regional area 
to see what opportunities arise.
Understanding How Sustainable 
Practices Boost Your Business’s Value
The argument for sustainable development as a path to success in the 21st 
century is widely documented. Companies with sound environmental man-
agement systems and corporate social responsibility policies and procedures 
outperform businesses that don’t have either. Why? Because overall, the 
management of an organization that considers these issues is well-rounded, 
attuned to global challenges, and positioned to make ethical product design 
choices.
What challenges you may ask? Climate change, international strife, huge 
trade deficits, and growing income disparity are just a few of the develop-
ments that come to mind. Quite frankly, they’re all bad for business prosper-
ity in the long term. Fortunately, fresh ways of thinking and doing business 
are evolving, and I share these new ideas in the following sections.
Bettering your bottom line
 
The most common area for a business to see immediate and tangible results 
from its implementation of green business practices is in cost savings. Reducing 
expenses clearly and directly impacts your bottom line, or net profit figure. 
Because cutting costs is the easiest sell for top management (if the sugges-
tions are coming from some other area of the company, that is), this step is 
often perceived as the best place to start.
The term ecoefficient, coined by the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development, refers to a management philosophy geared toward producing 
goods and services that use fewer resources. Because fewer raw materials 
and energy go into the production process and less waste is produced, an 
ecoefficient company has a clear competitive advantage by cutting its costs.

20
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Opportunities for ecoefficiency abound at all phases of your product and 
company life cycle. So how do you make the most of them? To embrace eco-
efficiency, you need to look at three broad objectives and identify how each 
functional area within your business can achieve the following:
 
✓ Doing more with less: Looking at ways to decrease your business’s use 
of energy, water, and land; improve product recyclability and durability; 
and close the loop on raw materials usage are all ways you can strive to 
do more with less.
 
✓ Reducing waste: Business waste is a cost that has no value-added 
capacity. Eliminating waste always contributes directly to an increased 
bottom line due to expense reductions.
 
✓ Enhancing product functionality: By focusing on selling your customers 
what they actually need, you can use fewer resources while maintaining 
the same (if not better) product value.
 
Identifying ways to make your company more ecoefficient isn’t a take-it-or-
leave-it mechanism, once-over, or series of rigid rules to comply with. It isn’t 
even a framework, per se, but rather a way of thinking about how exactly you 
can deliver value to your customers while using fewer resources — or in other 
words, how you can strive for continuous improvement by using less.
Skyrocketing the top-line trajectory
Sustainability has the potential to greatly enhance your company’s top line. In 
other words, green business practices can impact your revenue (and corre-
sponding business value) in a number of important and tangible ways, such as
 
✓ Enhancing your market share through innovation: Applying sustain-
able principles to the product design process often leads to identifying 
entirely new product lines to bring to market. For example, thinking 
deeply about environmental and social principles while engaging in 
product research and development (R&D) may lead your office furniture 
company to consider using organic, hemp, or other plant-based textiles. 
This entirely new product line may open up new markets and expand 
your thoughts to even more fresh and creative potential.
 
 Innovating to solve problems is also a key component of sustainable 
product design. For example, when a textile firm’s foreign supplier could 
no longer produce dyes because of European Union environmental regu-
lations, the firm developed an alternative, nontoxic color palette that’s 
now one of its strongest product lines.
 
✓ Bringing the look and feel of nature into your product: The idea that 
merging biological principles with product design is a visionary way to 
incorporate the lessons nature has already learned in nearly four billion 
years of evolution and adaptation is receiving more and more recognition 

21
 Chapter 1: What’s in It for My Company; What’s in It for My World?
these days. That’s why you can now find adhesives that are as strong as 
mollusk shells, binding agents as tough as a spider’s web, and buildings 
with underground chambers like termite mounds for natural cooling. For 
more on sustainable product design, see Chapter 7.
 
✓ Identifying massive markets in the developing world: Still another 
opportunity for green product development resides in meeting the basic 
needs of much of the developing world. The market for water purifica-
tion, environmentally benign household products, efficient fuels, and 
high-yield foods is astronomical in the Third World.
 
✓ Creating a competitive advantage by differentiating yourself: Although 
the proliferation of companies that are self-identifying as green has 
grown by leaps and bounds recently, you still have tremendous oppor-
tunity to separate yourself from the pack through your green business 
practices and sustainable product offerings. Being completely truthful 
about your effort with product R&D, operational changes, and corpo-
rate value shift makes you credible to your customers. As consumers 
become more green-savvy, they’ll continue to ferret out companies that 
greenwash (state that they’re green without taking the actions necessary 
to back up that statement) — and make those companies pay the price 
for it through lost revenue.
 
✓ Facilitating closed-loop customer relationships: Today’s consumers are 
increasingly interested in developing and maintaining relationships with 
companies that show a commitment to corporate social responsibility. 
Early sustainability advocates, such as Patagonia and The Body Shop, 
have built fanatically loyal customer bases. Survey after survey contin-
ues to indicate that Americans take corporate citizenship and sustain-
able product attributes into account when making purchasing decisions.
Fostering a desirable workplace 
for top-notch employees
Recruiting and retaining high-performing employees is obviously a key com-
ponent of building a profitable and sustainable business. But did you know 
that more and more forward-thinking employees are interested in working 
alongside colleagues with similar values at a company that clearly promotes 
social and environmental responsibility?
As your lighting fixture company offers sustainable and efficient light-
ing education to old-timer electricians, or your small medical clinic offers 
naturopathic and homeopathic services in addition to traditional western 
medicine, you’ll find like-minded employees clamoring to be a part of your 
progressive team. Why? Because top-notch green recruits want to work for 
companies that are reducing their carbon footprints and looking for nontoxic 
alternatives through green chemistry research. And here’s how you can ben-
efit as a result:

22
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
✓ Linking sustainability with pride: Because your company showcases 
its sustainability initiatives, employees become more invested in the 
company and stretch themselves and their co-workers to discover more 
creative ways to implement sustainable practices.
 
✓ Enhancing employee productivity: Research shows that employees 
who work in LEED-accredited buildings (see Chapter 8 for the scoop 
on this certification) or at companies with a high level of emphasis on 
corporate social responsibility are more likely to enjoy their jobs, have 
reduced rates of absenteeism, and indicate a much higher level of com-
mitment to their employers’ organizational missions.
 
✓ Encouraging innovation: After you start asking questions about how 
your business can operate in the most environmentally benign and 
socially just manner, creativity will be unleashed from within and out-
side of your firm. Just ask almost any business owner or manager who 
has taken this step.
 
✓ Providing passion in the workplace: You want your employees to be 
passionate about what you do, right? If your mid-sized company sells 
commercial real estate, you want your producers and support staff to 
believe in the product, your company, and its values. So why not hook 
up with a company that offers green mortgages and give a gift basket at 
closings that includes a smart power strip and a pack of compact fluo-
rescent light bulbs? I can guarantee you that with a simple jump-start, 
your employees will be offering up ideas on how your business can push 
the green envelope even further.
Finding the Best Focal Points for Your 
Business: A Preliminary Assessment
This book isn’t about instituting practices and procedures to lessen your 
unsustainable behavior; it’s about encouraging you to actively engage in 
redefining what the world will look like tomorrow. After all, being less bad 
isn’t the same as being good.
Clearly all the challenges and trends the global village faces today are interre-
lated; fixing one stand-alone problem may easily come at the expense of exac-
erbating another. For example, farmland is being diverted to create biofuels 
in response to fossil fuel prices. In turn, grain prices are increasing, leading to 
more global food insecurity.
For business, developing sustainably requires looking at the whole picture 
and understanding the symptoms of a flawed system. When looking at your 

23
 Chapter 1: What’s in It for My Company; What’s in It for My World?
business, you need to devote some systems-based thinking toward address-
ing problems such as excessive waste output and over-reliance on rapidly 
depleting natural resources. For example, if your manufacturing process is 
reliant on hazardous materials, the impact of this dependence will ripple 
through all aspects of the triple bottom line.
 
To maximize effects on people, planet, and profit, you may want to consider 
the following types of questions to stimulate preliminary conversation about 
where your business has the most opportunity for change:
 
✓ How can your company help people and the planet to flourish in the 
future? Instead of focusing on changing negative behaviors, this ques-
tion helps you identify new market possibilities.
 
✓ Do your products and services fill authentic needs? As new raw materi-
als become harder to source and waste streams become more difficult 
to handle, consumption is going to steer toward items that truly meet 
human needs and away from purely materialistic items. Quit trying to 
create new products for the already oversaturated and indulged con-
sumer and focus on determining whether your product or service can 
meet real needs.
 
✓ Can you measure your business success by broader terms than prof-
itability and increased sales? Positive impact on the planet and its 
people is just as important as positive financial statements for a truly 
sustainable business.
 
✓ Is your company making meaningful efforts to decrease its energy use 
through efficiency and conservation efforts? Essentially, how depend-
able is your energy supply? Identifying where you can access alternative 
energy will position you ahead of the curve in the coming decades.
 
✓ How reliable is your water supply? How dependent are your produc-
tion processes or facility operations on cheap and available water? What 
sort of efficiency mechanisms and processes do you have in place to 
regulate your use of water? Identifying long-term options to access water 
and reducing your need for freshwater is an important systems-wide 
concern. Particularly in arid locales, requiring tremendous amounts of 
water for operations is a big area of exposure.
 
✓ What concern might your customers have about toxicity in your facili-
ties, products, or services? Your potential for litigation from communities, 
shareholders, employees, and customers is increased if your company uses 
hazardous materials. Systems-based thinking may compel you to explore 
plant-based alternatives to the toxins currently used in your business.
 
✓ How much greenhouse gas does your company emit annually? What 
are you doing to reduce these emissions, and how will your business 
absorb the increased cost associated with emitting carbon in the future?

24
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
✓ Are your products, services, and facilities poised competitively for a 
carbon-constrained future? Consider whether you offer products and 
services that can help consumers mitigate and adapt to global warming. 
You just may wind up opening the door to innovative new products and 
services.
 
✓ How dependent is your business on forests, farmland, and fish? Look 
at ways you can cut back your dependence on natural capital in order to 
preserve these precious resources.

How Nature’s Laws Are 
Dictating Change
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding mankind’s impact on the environment and how you can help mitigate it
▶ Gauging the Earth’s response and what you can do to improve the current trend
I
n order to craft a vision of how your business can benefit from the 
opportunities inherent in combating global challenges, it’s important to 
honestly examine the state of today’s world. Certain undeniable biological 
and physical laws are dictating the changes you’re seeing in governmental 
policies, intercontinental commerce, individual behaviors, and grassroots 
movements everywhere. The law of diminishing returns, Newton’s third 
law of motion (for every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction), and 
the laws of thermodynamics (on energy creation and waste) are magnifying 
humanity’s wasteful ways. This imperiled planet is suffering from overexploi-
tation and downright carelessness. It seems almost impossible that humans 
could have such a negative impact on so very many complex planetary func-
tions. The bright side to the story, however, is that mankind also possesses 
the capacity to have a positive impact and reverse negative trends while con-
tributing to solving the world’s problems.
The Deeds: Human Forces behind 
the Green Movement
No one wants to look in the mirror and see the cause of many of the world’s 
environmental and social ills staring back. Yet although human behavior 
has driven and accelerated many of the perilous situations facing the world 
today, the capacity for solutions lies in those same hands. Global poverty, 
natural resource depletion, and toxic waste streams are all human-propelled 
problems that businesses can play a significant role in fixing. The following 
sections guide you through the most pressing problems facing businesses in 
the 21st century — and what you can do about them.

26
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Grasping globalization
The rise of the global business model, although touted as a way to boost eco-
nomic growth for many of the world’s poor, has actually increased income 
disparity both internationally and within individual countries’ boundaries. 
Many large, polluting companies have resettled in countries with few or no 
environmental laws as part of the race to the bottom, the business tactic of 
moving manufacturing facilities offshore in order to get around environmen-
tal and workers’ rights laws found in the developed world. These compa-
nies’ polluting activities intensify as a result — as do their odds of creating 
ecorefugees (people driven from their homes due to serious environmental 
disruptions) and stripping native citizens of their ability to fish or practice 
subsistence farming.
 
The other side of the globalization problem is that the Earth’s population isn’t 
declining. In fact, population projections show that anywhere from 9 to 10 
billion people worldwide will be relying on increasingly scarce water, forests, 
fuel, food, and fertile land by 2050, according to current growth rates. Add 
to this projection the fact that currently 800 million people are chronically 
hungry; 2 billion people live on less than a dollar per day; and 30,000 people 
die every day because they’re too poor to stay alive.
These aren’t shock-and-awe statistics. Rather, they reflect the reality of 
today’s world. With such factors in play, it’s not surprising that most people 
look at conserving the environment as a very distant second to scraping 
together enough calories to get through the day.
 
Working toward meaningful policies for poverty reduction is critical to the 
long-term sustainability of the Earth and its people. Yet the nagging questions 
remain: If this unchecked growth continues, people can’t prosper economi-
cally, right? Environmentalists, free-market capitalists and social welfare folks 
can’t all work toward common goals, can they? The unbelievable simplicity 
and solidity of sustainable development is the unequivocal response. Mankind 
A snapshot of the world at large
More than 6.5 billion people currently occupy 
the Earth, according to the World Clock found

the world’s approximate population, the World 
Clock provides an ongoing picture of the amount 
of oil extracted from the Earth, carbon dioxide 
emissions, the Earth’s temperature, the rate of 
forest depletion, money spent on military items, 
and other rough snapshots of mankind’s impact 
on the planet on a moment-by-moment basis.

can have it all. Maybe, just maybe, however, “all” looks a little different from 
what everyone thinks! Maybe the focus isn’t on growing consumption but 
on developing community-based commerce, technology that lets people live 
lighter, and products that serve the world’s poorest people. Perhaps your 
company can play a part in using its resources and innovative capabilities 
to reduce waste, increase the productivity of precious raw materials, and 
improve the lives of billions of people at the same time.
Many products, such as hand-held, solar-powered water purifiers and insecti-
cide-treated malaria nets, are enhancing the triple bottom line for companies 
that are targeting improving the quality of life for the world’s poorest (see 
Chapter 1 for the basics on the triple bottom line). Growing service-oriented 
sectors, like microfinance and microinsurance, are reshaping funding models 
in meaningful ways in the developing world. If your business is part of the 
supply chain for any of the big corporations, or if you have a vision for how 
to solve more localized problems, you too can be a part of the bigger solution 
to the challenges caused by globalization.
Focusing on the fate of fossil fuels
Fossil fuels, including crude oil (petroleum), coal, and natural gas, are a finite 
natural resource created under the Earth’s surface during the last 200 million 
years by plant matter and great pressure. Since the discovery of coal a short 
250 years ago, most of the planet’s easily extractable petroleum has been 
removed.
Petroleum is a finite resource, and many people believe that the height of 
global oil production — what’s called the peak oil period — is past and that 
petroleum extraction has entered a period of gradual but constant decline. 
Although oil still exists, it continues to be more difficult to extract and of 
lower quality. As oil exploration and extraction becomes more expensive and 
demand continues to grow, price will only be pushed higher and higher. In 
fact, many believe that the days of cheap energy sources are gone, replaced 
by permanent energy woes.
 
The crucial consideration for business is that much of commerce relies on stable 
and cheap fossil fuels. If your organization uses coal or petroleum as a raw mate-
rial or relies heavily on it to power facilities and transport raw materials and/or 
products, now may be the time to look at how your company will be positioned in 
the future. Relying on a tenuous fossil fuel future may expose you to risk.
 
Start looking at ways to shift your energy consumption from fossil fuels to 
renewable, or alternative, energy. Also, consider making other changes to 
lessen your business’s dependency on fossil fuels. For example, establish pro-
duction and distribution centers that are close by each other.

28
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Renewable energy relies on the Earth’s ecosystems. The most common forms 
of it are
 
✓ Biofuels (ethanol and cellulosic)
 
✓ Biomass (including algae and waste products)
 
✓ Geothermal power
 
✓ Hydrogen and fuel cells
 
✓ Hydropower (including wave and tidal power)
 
✓ Solar power
 
✓ Wind power
Keep in mind that each of these renewable energy sources has pros and 
cons, and that the applicability, cost, and benefits of each are dependent on 
your situation. Part II covers the reduction of fossil-fuel reliance in your facili-
ties; product research, development, and design; and transportation, deliv-
ery, and office practices.
Wading through waste
When the trash company comes and removes the unsightly garbage from 
your front curb, it’s either taking that trash to a landfill or an incineration 
plant. Neither of these options is sustainable in the long term. Landfill space 
itself is decreasing; methane (a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to 
climate change) is released from existing landfills; and toxins are emitted into 
the air when trash is incinerated.
 
The second law of thermodynamics states that matter and energy tend to 
disperse. Eventually, all matter introduced into society will be reprocessed 
by natural systems. That means everything that doesn’t naturally biodegrade 
(reabsorb into the biosphere quickly and organically) will be around, some-
times for thousands of years, including materials like polystyrene and many of 
the 75,000 synthetic chemicals used in North America (legally!) today.
Some researchers estimate that an astounding 70 percent of garbage consists 
of recyclable items. Yet less than one-third of all businesses in the U.S. have 
formal recycling programs. The cost of all that waste to the environment and 
the businesses is astronomical.
There is, however, a way to break this cycle of depletion and waste, and 
commerce (that’s you!) will be a driving force in this transition. As a busi-
ness owner, you probably already know that waste costs money. So why not 
rethink your business model to focus on both gaining profit and protecting 
the planet and its people? By eliminating as much of your solid waste as pos-
sible, you can achieve positive triple-bottom-line results. By engaging in such 

29
 Chapter 2: How Nature’s Laws Are Dictating Change
sustainable business practices, you also have tremendous opportunities to 
design new kinds of products — ones that aren’t wasteful or degenerative, 
and will meet your customers’ needs without hurting the environment.
Pondering pollution and the 
Tragedy of the Commons
Sheltering, feeding, transporting, and producing products for the global vil-
lage releases tons of chemicals and greenhouse gases into the air. Large-scale 
corporate agriculture relies on pesticides to protect crops — pesticides that 
leach into groundwater or run off into waterways — and overfertilizes in 
coastal regions, resulting in dead zones and algae plumes. Approximately 2.2 
billion huge cargo ships shuttle goods back and forth overseas, spreading 
garbage, leaking pollutants, and occasionally wrecking and dispersing what-
ever contaminants and products they’re carrying onboard in the process.
What’s worse is that atmospheric, soil, and oceanic pollution prove difficult 
to control because no one owns the air, land, and seas. Consequently, no one 
country or entity is accountable for keeping them clean. Instead, these areas 
simply become dumping grounds for human waste, resulting in a phenom-
enon known as the Tragedy of the Commons.
As international companies develop green business practices on a large 
scale, the result will be a significant reduction in worldwide pollution levels. 
Corporate greenhouse gas reduction policies will help curb the air pollution 
that leads to global warming; the development of strategies to replace toxic 
materials and chemicals with more plant-based alternatives will reduce the 
pollution of both land and sea. Additionally, the technological innovations 
originating primarily from the business world will continue to offer exciting 
ways to convert landfill and animal waste into fuels.
Tackling toxins in everyday 
products and food sources
In the U.S. alone, 110,000 toxic chemicals are legally cleared for use, but only 
5 percent of them have been tested by the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) for their effect on human health. These toxins are present in such 
items as carpets, electronics, furniture, bedding, paints, toys, household plas-
tics, cosmetics, and cleaning supplies — just to name a few.
Increasing press on these hazardous materials in daily life has contributed 
to the explosion of green products in homes, businesses, yards, cars, offices, 
nurseries, hotels, restaurants, and even cemeteries. So what can you do 

30
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
to contribute? The leaders of companies that are moving toward sustain-
ability use gray and black lists to screen undesirable chemicals. Gray is for 
chemicals they want to phase out; black is for chemicals they refuse to allow 
in their products to begin with. Chemicals finding their way onto this list 
include cancer-causing agents, toxins that mimic hormones, and susbstances 
that can increase the frequency of mutations in future generations.
On the food side of the equation, factory farming, which involves the wide-
spread use of synthetic hormones and other chemical additives to create low 
costs and high growth yields, has become the norm for the large-scale raising 
of farm animals in many parts of the world. These unnatural diets turn cows 
and chickens into petroleum products because the animals are now receiving 
their sustenance from food that has been sprayed with fertilizers and pesti-
cides and not allowed to grow naturally. They also cause digestive-system 
damage that weakens the animals’ immune systems and creates deadly gas 
bloating. Because factory-farm animals are raised so closely together, they 
also receive antibiotics for disease prevention.
 
If your business is involved in any way with food products, look at how you 
can capitalize on the growing movement toward slow food, organic products, 
and locally produced foodstuffs. Media discussions surrounding tainted food 
are alarming for many people, leading to a renewed interest in knowing who’s 
producing your food and how they’re doing it. For example, many grocery 
stores now have store brands that are oriented toward organic products. 
Chapter 11 delves into the growing consumer movement away from corporate 
food and toward local production and processing.
Interesting odds ’n’ ends
To get a feel for the environmental impact of the 
average American consumer, check out these 
statistics:
 ✓ On average, individual Americans emit 
22 tons of carbon dioxide per year. (The 
International Panel on Climate Change 
states that carbon dioxide must be reduced 
80 percent by 2050 to stabilize the climate.)
 ✓ If Americans drove autos that got a meager 
three miles per gallon more, the U.S. would 
save one million barrels of oil per day. 
(That’s more than what the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge is projected to produce in 
totality.)
 ✓ If every American household bought one 
roll of post-consumer-waste toilet paper 
per year, 155,000 virgin trees would be 
saved.
 ✓ If each human being used his or her “‘fair 
Earth share” of resources, it would come 
to about 4.6 acres. (Americans typically use 
about 23.7 acres each.)
 ✓ Americans constitute about 4 percent of the 
world’s population and emit about 25 per-
cent of its carbon dioxide.
 ✓ Americans throw away about 4.6 pounds of 
garbage per day.

The Industrial Revolution enhanced the quality of life for many people 
throughout the past 250 years. Unfortunately, the rate at which humans have 
extracted oil, water, and natural resources in response to newfound technol-
ogies is causing Mother Earth to rebel at an alarming rate. In the next several 
sections, I highlight the major reactions affecting life on the planet today.
Warming up the globe
The most talked about international crisis of the times is global warming, a 
slight but continuing increase in the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere. 
In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; a panel of 160 
scientists from 130 countries, appointed by their respective governments) 
released its fourth in a series of reports spanning 20 years. The group’s most 
worrisome finding about climate change was how incredibly far-reaching 
it is. Every single living being is interconnected, and when one ecosystem 
is thrown off the slightest bit, the whole system starts falling apart at the 
seams, escalating in speed. The IPCC concluded that there’s a 90-percent 
chance the acceleration of global warming is due in large part to mankind’s 
release of greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere.
 
Six primary greenhouse gasses form a shield in the atmosphere and trap the 
solar heat that reflects from the Earth’s surface, much like a greenhouse. 
They’re emitted when people and businesses burn fossil fuels, primarily coal.
Off the cuff, most people think that cars are the heaviest contributors to 
greenhouse gas emissions. But oh, how wrong they are. In fact, building, 
operating, deconstructing, and renovating structures account for 47 percent 
of the greenhouse gas emissions in North America, which is 7 percent more 
than the transportation and agriculture industries combined. The primary 
contributors to greenhouse gas emissions are the buildings people live and 
work in (about 47 percent) and transportation (about 27 percent). Other big 
contributors include large-scale agricultural practices, deforestation, and 
industrial production.
If carbon dioxide emissions aren’t cut drastically (some say 80 percent by 
2050), all sorts of global instability may occur, including escalating drought 
(think more intense wildfire seasons, less arable land, and an alarming global 
food insecurity), increased flooding, and oceanic warming. For more on the 
effects of global warming, see the nearby “Climate surprises” sidebar.

Almost every proactive step you take (including greening your daily office 
practices, analyzing your product line for ways to ecoimprove, and developing 
sustainable employment policies) will help decrease your organization’s 
carbon dioxide emissions. For example, lessening raw material input reduces 
the amount of fossil fuels embedded in transporting products. Increasing 
energy efficiency cuts down on emissions. Lessening water saves emissions 
because most industrial pumps are powered by electricity. Implementing vir-
tually any suggestion you find in this book will lighten your business’s carbon 
footprint.
Shrinking the Earth’s usable water supply
The amount of usable water sources worldwide is dwindling, largely due to a 
global demand that’s rising at roughly two times the rate of the Earth’s popu-
lation growth. Many scientists predict that groundwater depletion and fresh-
water salinization (the contamination of freshwater with salt) pose a growing 
threat. They see the wars of the future being fought over water rather than 
oil. Due to shrinking glaciers attributable to global warming, the IPCC’s most 
recent report shows that water systems that rely on capturing snowmelt will 
be particularly at risk in the future.
Closer to home, some scientists expect the water-starved American Southwest 
(where population growth is outpacing the availability of resources to support 
it) will vie for dwindling supplies from its lakes and reservoirs. The Great 
Lakes are already experiencing algae blooms due to phosphate runoff from 
Climate surprises
Global warming models show many predictable 
trends, such as oceanic temperature change 
and biodiversity migration northward. However, 
the truly scary things are the unknowns, called 
climate surprises — climate events that sci-
entists can’t accurately predict and that even 
the most sophisticated computer models can’t 
forecast. The two big unknowns are
 ✓ How the warming of the oceans will affect 
the oceanic conveyor belts — those mass 
figure-eight currents that swirl around the 
globe — and the impact that permanently 
altering these natural currents will have 
on marine life, storms, and global weather 
patterns.
 ✓ What impact the melting of the West 
Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) will have on 
global sea levels. Although modeling can 
show what happens when the ocean levels 
rise 1 meter, 2 meters, or 6 meters, the 
actual impact of losing the WAIS is impos-
sible to predict.

33
 Chapter 2: How Nature’s Laws Are Dictating Change
sewage and detergents. The demand for groundwater, like the giant Ogallala 
Aquifer that runs from Texas to South Dakota, pits agricultural interests 
against tourism, hydropower, industrial concerns, and the needs of urban 
areas.
 
Businesses have tremendous impact on water quality and supply. For exam-
ple, giant agricultural interests threaten whole aquifers, and groundwater 
pollution attributable to runoff from toxic chemicals is a threat in many parts 
of the world. Consequently, analyzing your business’s reliance on freshwater 
access is an important first step to helping improve the Earth’s usable water 
supply.
 
If your production process is reliant on an uninterrupted supply of water, you 
may want to look at alternative processes or new materials that don’t require 
such intensive reliance on water. Additionally, small daily changes in your 
office, such as installing low-flow plumbing fixtures and native landscaping 
(rather than water-intensive sod) can add up to big water reductions.
Accelerating the loss of biodiversity
Much of the world’s natural capital (water, minerals, soil, and the like) has 
been overharvested to increase companies’ short-term profits and meet a 
more demanding global population. This situation is disturbing because 
so many products — from medicines and building materials to food and 
clothing — partially come from the Earth’s rich tapestry of biodiversity. I 
touch on three distinct ways biodiversity is fading in the following sections.
The dilemma of deforestation
Trees are arguably the world’s most perfect creation. They feed on renew-
able solar energy, are aesthetically beautiful, and help control erosion and 
the hydrology cycle. They also sequester, or capture, carbon dioxide from 
the air. As the intensity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the 
role of trees becomes more and more vital in controlling greenhouse gas 
concentration.
Unfortunately, deforestation is occurring at a truly alarming rate, particu-
larly in richly biodiverse areas such as the Amazon. Forestry experts predict 
that by the middle of the 21st century, 95 percent of the wet tropics will be 
lost forever (which is extremely unfortunate because we need more trees to 
sequester carbon, not less). Add to that the effects of natural disasters such 
as Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed approximately 320 million trees in 
2005 and released as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as all U.S. for-
ests sequester in an entire year.

34
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
But there’s hope! Because of the increased interest in assigning monetary 
value to carbon in the form of carbon markets (financial venues for the trad-
ing of carbon dioxide emissions), old-growth forests that have tons of seques-
tered carbon may be worth more for their carbon value than their timber, so 
deforestation might be greatly slowed!
The lack of fresh farmland
In much of North America, dirt doesn’t seem to be a precious commodity. 
However, in some regions, it can take thousands of years for one inch of fer-
tile topsoil to be produced. Worldwide demand for food, coupled with the 
transition to a heavier, meat-based diet in the developed world, has degraded 
much of the Earth’s agricultural and grazing land. Consequently, precious 
little potential remains for expanding cultivation.
 
In fact, arable land has been lost to sprawl, erosion, monocultures (particularly 
cotton), and salinization at a pace that’s much more rapid than the Earth’s 
capacity to reproduce it. Today, 6.5 billion people are fed on 80 percent of the 
land that was available in 1950, when the world supported 2.5 billion people.
Sustainable agriculture, aquaculture, and organic fibers (like hemp) are 
showing promise for decreasing the impact on farmland. Additionally, busi-
nesses that are introducing organic and natural foods and products are help-
ing to create demand for items that are more environmentally benign.
The case of the disappearing marine life
Birds, turtles, sharks, mammals, and many inedible fish are captured on the 
miles and miles of baited hooks found at long-line fisheries. By vacuuming the 
ocean of its contents, this practice is accelerating the extinction potential of 
many marine species.
If fishing practices continue at the current pace (with about 60 percent of the 
world’s fisheries practicing unsustainable operations), biologists and ocean-
ographers estimate that global fishing stocks will completely collapse by the 
mid-21st century. What was once thought of as the great protein source to 
feed a hungry world may utterly cease to exist.
Fortunately, big distributors and retailers are now demanding Marine 
Stewardship Council (MSC)–certified seafood products, which is helping 
advance the movement toward sustainable fisheries — a huge step in the 
right direction.

Preparing to Create Your 
Sustainability Plan
In This Chapter
▶ Immersing yourself in the sustainability mindset
▶ Understanding well-known frameworks for green change
▶ Forming a team of people to blaze an ecoplanning trail for others to follow
▶ Addressing budgetary planning concerns
Jumping into any new endeavor (like, say, greening your business) 
requires a good deal of foresight and planning — especially in regards to 
creating your plan. To have a shot at ecosuccess, you first need to establish a 
sustainable mindset and a solid framework for your actions. The sustainabil-
ity frameworks I present in this chapter have helped some of the most vision-
ary companies around stimulate creativity, add significant business value, 
and operate with new overall social and environmental goals in mind.
Of course, greening your business isn’t a solo effort. Every company needs 
change agents to drive the ecoshift — this chapter helps you identify those 
folks and bring them together to form your green team.
Becoming a Sustainable Thinker
In order to successfully plan and implement sustainable business practices, 
you have to be an organized and action-oriented manager. In order to innovate, 
develop, create, and lead your business in its ecotransition, you must dial into 
where the actions originate: your mind. Yes, technically you can flip to any chap-
ter in this book and start executing the changes I recommend without giving 
them much deep thought, but your efforts won’t be as effective as they could be.
Most sustainability champions possess at least some of the traits described 
in the following sections. I’ve grouped them into personality traits and leader-
ship and business-related skills to help you navigate through them.

36
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Personality traits
 
Sustainable thinkers usually have some common characteristics pertaining to 
their interests, motivations, and convictions. By and large, these character-
istics center on the idea of selflessness — or at least a pursuit of the greater 
good for the greatest number of beneficiaries. Some of the most common 
sustainability-related personality traits include the following:
 
✓ A desire for information: The world of sustainability is constantly 
evolving, so being committed to staying in the loop on all things green is 
invaluable. On average, ecothinkers have been exposed to at least one 
pivotal piece of sustainability literature, such as Hawken’s The Ecology 
of Commerce, McDonough and Braungart’s Cradle to Cradle, Banyus’s 
Biomimicry, Ellkington’s Cannibals with Forks, or Hart’s Capitalism at the 
Crossroads. And usually one such work isn’t enough — these folks keep 
on devouring whatever information they can get their hands on. They 
also stay up to speed on the latest trends in sustainability, which gives 
them not only the necessary foundational knowledge in environmental 
and social issues but also an awareness of the larger, evolving green pic-
ture and a strong business base.
 
✓ A strong sense of empathy and justice: One of the overarching premises 
of triple-bottom-line thinking is that each element — the people affected 
by your commercial transactions, the environment, and your business’s 
profitability — has equal and viable importance. Sustainable thinkers 
have a strong sense of identification with stakeholders and communities 
that may share little in common with their personal or cultural norms. 
Because empathy conveys the ability to imagine oneself in another per-
son’s situation, it’s a highly desirable trait when dealing with employees, 
impacted communities, and foreign suppliers and subcontractors, for 
example.
 
✓ Patience: If you’ve ever gotten exasperated when trying to convince 
someone to donate to your favorite charity or support the company’s 
volunteering program, chances are you’ve seen firsthand why patience and 
consistency are essential for building support for your cause. And because 
green thinking doesn’t come naturally to everyone — and in fact has 
been polarized as the enemy of traditional free market capitalism — 
patience is even more essential when building support for sustainable 
business practices.
 
✓ A willingness to stick to principles: Initiating true change and garnering 
others’ buy-in is only possible if you have an unwavering dedication to 
your core values — in this case, the idea that people, planet, and profit 
can only be sustained through concerted and innovative business efforts.
 
✓ An extraordinarily strong work ethic: Although their work is tremen-
dously important and at times arduous, green leaders don’t quit advo-
cating for sustainability — even when faced with negative reactions from 
senior management, peers, or external stakeholders. Such perseverance 

37
 Chapter 3: Preparing to Create Your Sustainability Plan
is essential when promoting ecochange. Without it, there’d be no hope 
of ever getting a project off the ground or effecting widespread cultural 
shifts.
 
✓ A passion for spearheading outcomes that maximize the triple bottom 
line (benefits to people, planet, and profit): Much of a sustainability 
champion’s success is based on the fact that you’ll usually find her fol-
lowing her passion, diligently trying to “bring along” those around her. 
Another characteristic is the knowledge that passion must be married to 
high-impact solutions.
 
✓ A willingness to share success: The sustainability champion recognizes 
that multiple people play a part in greening a company and that every-
one should share in the kudos for efforts expended. Green advocates 
acknowledge everyone who contributes to a particular green project, 
no matter how minor the input may have been or how early or late the 
person got involved.
Leadership and business-related skills
 
Leadership coaches say that attitude is half the battle in any endeavor, but 
some measure of social skills and business savvy is an important part of form-
ing ideals, finding practical ways to meet them, inspiring others to collaborate 
with you, and achieving success. Following are skill sets that are crucial to 
possess when greening business practices, whether you’re in the top ranks of 
your business or trying to get your grassroots efforts in motion:
 
✓ An understanding of risk/reward trade-offs: High levels of risk can 
lead to big rewards, but not everyone can stomach this kind of business 
roulette. A sustainability champion isn’t afraid of doing what it takes to 
make his working environment a little greener, even if that means taking 
a personal risk (like presenting Chapter 1’s business case for sustainabil-
ity to senior management) or taking a risk that’s more far-reaching (such 
as agreeing to oversee the reconfiguration of the entire company’s prod-
uct packaging). When this person sees an opportunity for benefiting the 
triple bottom line (and often himself as well), he isn’t afraid to take it.
 
✓ A gift for selling an idea: Sometimes what you say isn’t as important 
as how you present it, or how you craft your case to meet potential 
resistance. A good sustainability champion can speak eloquently and 
persuasively. He also knows how deep to delve into an issue — being 
particularly conversant on the molecular structure of a toxin isn’t impor-
tant so long as you can make a sound case as to why the toxin shouldn’t 
be in your company’s product line in the first place.
 
✓ A knack for building team spirit: The old “my way or no way” philoso-
phy doesn’t fly in the world of sustainability. To truly make any ecosteps 
forward, both an understanding of the value of teamwork and the ability 
to bring like-minded folk together are essential. Sustainability champions 

38
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
typically have both in spades — and better yet, they tend to put these 
skills into action in fun and engaging ways. They seek allies from any 
rung of the company ladder, from the janitor to the CEO or majority 
shareholder.
 
✓ A talent for project management: Transitioning your business to a 
green model is the result of many activities — brainstorming the idea, 
planning for it, acquiring the capital needed to turn it into reality, imple-
menting the idea, communicating the change to stakeholders, evaluating 
the impact the change has had on the company, and so many more. The 
sustainability advocate can usually balance all these parts — and see 
the holistic connection between them — because he can both see and 
communicate the bigger ecopicture.
 
✓ An appreciation for incremental change: Sweeping, all-encompassing 
green change usually results in a sustainability plan that falls flat. 
Because most people are resistant to change and often mistakenly see 
going green as a huge change, you need to take baby steps if you want 
better odds for success. A true sustainability champion knows to start 
small, build a history of successful initiatives, and keep all the research, 
lessons learned, and project-assessment data clear and accessible.
 
✓ An ability to see the bigger picture: Sustainability isn’t limited to just one 
aspect or department of your business. That’s why aligning sustainability 
priorities among departments is hugely important, as is the ability to 
design green initiatives that are easily replicable (with small modifica-
tions) in other areas of the company. Sustainability champions can take 
the task at hand to the next level. If, for example, that task is examining 
the ramifications of eliminating toxins from the office building and grounds, 
true sustainability champions can see the bigger picture and consider 
how to eliminate the toxins from all products and all processes.
 
✓ An ability to think outside the box: The old, standard ways of doing 
business are part of what has lead to today’s global challenges and 
threats. Therefore, you can’t rely on these old methods if you want to 
bring about ecochange. True sustainability champions aren’t afraid to 
brainstorm their own ideas or research ways that other companies’ 
solutions can be applied to the sustainability challenges facing their 
workplaces. They subscribe to the notion that sometimes pressing chal-
lenges must be addressed by revolutionary ideas.
Recognizing Common Frameworks 
for Sustainable Development
To help you form your green value system and inspire or institute change at 
your place of business, I present to you two sustainability frameworks, or sets 
of guiding green principles. Many large companies, such as Ikea and Volvo, 

39
 Chapter 3: Preparing to Create Your Sustainability Plan
have followed a sustainability framework as a way to align their business tac-
tics with an overall sustainability strategy. When planning for new product 
lines, markets, facilities, or processes, the principles inherent in these frame-
works channel your green team’s energy toward identifying how to accom-
plish the task at hand while considering nature’s constraints.
The Natural Step
The Natural Step (TNS) is a set of system conditions that outlines how busi-
ness must align operations with ecological constraints in order to negoti-
ate a place in the future. It was created in 1989 by Dr. Karl-Henrik Robèrt, a 
leading cancer scientist in Sweden, as an all-encompassing set of principles 
necessary for ecological and societal sustainability. The entire framework for 
making strategic sustainable business decisions according to TNS is encom-
passed by adhering to certain system conditions. You may suspect that this 
is a lengthy list. Au contraire! Although the Earth’s ecosystem is extraordi-
narily complex, the ways in which humans (and businesses by default) are 
contributing to its destruction are deceptively simple.
 
The TNS framework helps guide you in examining how your business can 
become sustainable, and therefore prosper in the long term, by describing 
four system conditions that must be complied with in order to maintain a sus-
tainable society:
 
✓ The Earth’s biosphere isn’t increasingly subjected to substances that 
are removed from the Earth’s crust.
 
✓ The Earth’s biosphere isn’t increasingly subjected to substances pro-
duced by society.
 
✓ The Earth’s biosphere isn’t systematically impoverished by physical dis-
placement, overharvesting, or other forms of ecosystem manipulation.
 
✓ Resources are disbursed fairly and efficiently in order to meet the basic 
needs of all members of the global population.
These conditions for sustainability are most readily applicable to product 
design (see Chapter 7 for more on this topic), but are used by many green 
business visionaries as guidance for decisions affecting daily operations, 
facilities, corporate strategy, governance, and the creation of competitive 
marketing advantage. Billion-dollar companies such as Volvo and Rohm and 
Haas subscribe wholeheartedly to TNS as their sustainability framework of 
choice, but the true beauty of TNS is found in its wide applicability to any 
size organization.
The following sections delve into the four system conditions of the TNS 
framework in more detail.

40
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Minimizing usage of natural resources
The first system condition of TNS addresses the issue that mankind is remov-
ing natural resources from the Earth more quickly than they can be replaced. 
Think about it. The Earth took billions of years to create and sequester min-
erals, heavy metals, and fossil fuels in its crust. Now society is extracting 
these materials from the Earth’s crust and redistributing them into the soil, 
water, and air at a rate faster than the ecosphere can absorb them, which is 
leading to the gradual destruction of the very ecosystems upon which soci-
ety depends. For example, removing fossilized carbon (coal) and burning it is 
contributing to climate change, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss, inten-
sifying natural disasters, and leading to less food security via desertification, 
flooding, and the like.
 
How does this system condition pertain to business? For business to flourish in 
the long term, the distribution of the Earth’s natural resources must be regu-
lated. Because natural resources have been used to power commercial facili-
ties and manufacture products for years, the business world has boundless 
opportunities for creating a balance between what’s taken out of the Earth and 
what goes back into it. Your company’s choice of raw materials (new versus 
recycled and reused), choice of energy sources (renewable versus nonrenew-
able), method of product manufacturing and distribution (cradle to cradle 
or cradle to grave), and embrace of technological innovation to increase 
resource productivity can all make a difference.
Limiting production of harmful chemicals and excess waste
The advancement of human technology and the growth of the global popula-
tion have lead to increased production of harmful substances and excess 
waste — which is precisely what the second system condition of TNS addresses. 
Nature has no experience in assimilating synthetic compounds produced by 
humans. Thus, the rate at which nonbiodegradable substances are being pro-
duced by humans far exceeds the Earth’s capacity to incorporate them into 
living systems. Whole new families of toxins are being introduced into the 
Earth’s rivers, air, soil, and seas — even at this very moment. Additionally, 
solid waste “disposal” (I use that term loosely; there’s really no “away” when 
throwing trash away), whether the garbage is incinerated, dumped in the 
ocean, or sent to a landfill, is occurring with a frequency that’s destabilizing 
natural systems at an alarming pace.
 
How does this system condition pertain to business? Any business owner has 
had experience with this system condition in the form of compliance with 
waste-disposal regulations. You know there’s a financial price to pay if you 
don’t follow the law. However, excess production of harmful chemicals and 
waste has hidden costs as well — negative health effects caused by persistent 
pollutants and increased insurance and capital costs. When combined, these 

41
 Chapter 3: Preparing to Create Your Sustainability Plan
costs add up to billions of dollars a year in unnecessary business expenses. So 
you can see that there are some specific, strategic advantages inherent in less-
ening (and eventually eliminating) your company’s waste production.
Balancing consumption with rejuvenation
The third system condition of TNS focuses on the idea of balance and being 
grateful for what Mother Nature so generously provides. Just think about the 
vast array of products and services, valued at trillions of dollars per year, 
that comes from nature: Pharmaceuticals, food, pollination, flood and erosion 
control, topsoil, water, fibers, and timber are but a handful. Throughout his-
tory, mankind has taken advantage of these gifts, but particularly in the last 
century, society has operated with a “take, take, and take some more” mind-
set — without pausing to think about how these harmful consumption pat-
terns are altering the very resources it depends on. As grasslands, wetlands, 
fisheries, and forests give way to sprawl, blacktop, monocultures, and the 
like, mankind is imperiling its own ability to survive.
 
How does this system condition pertain to business? This system condition is 
designed to engage you in taking better care of nature and rejuvenating it at 
every level and across every function of your organization. For example, if you 
use forest products in your catalogues, construction, or packaging, be sure to 
source from a vendor that practices sustainable harvesting. Likewise, when 
planning expansion activities of any sort, attach high importance to maintain-
ing the integrity of natural ecosystems.
Treating the Earth’s human resources equally
Sustainability isn’t just about protecting the environment. A fundamental 
aspect of sustainability is the equal and humane treatment of all members 
of society. In today’s world, however, overconsumers (citizens of developed 
nations) and underconsumers (citizens of developing nations) are far from 
equal — which is where the fourth TNS system condition comes into play. 
True sustainability can’t be achieved without social transformation that 
acknowledges the value of each human life as equally valuable.
 
How does this system condition pertain to business? This fourth and final system 
condition challenges business to explore how it can increase positive human 
impact by providing solutions to the world’s neediest. Some organizations are 
already making progress in this arena. For example, Grameen Bank has a spe-
cialized program to provide microcapital to beggars; Nike is actively working 
on enhancing youth athletic programs on Native American reservations; and 
Proctor & Gamble’s new clothes rinse product sold to the rural poor radically 
reduces the amount of time women must spend finding and hauling water. 
Additionally, countless organizations are finding market value in designing 
products to meet developing countries’ needs or in collaborating with non-
profits to lessen this gripping global crisis (see Chapter 12 for ways your com-
pany can partner with a nonprofit).

42
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Natural Capitalism
Natural Capitalism was the first framework designed to show businesses 
how the new century’s profits would be drawn from engaging in socially and 
environmentally responsible behaviors. Whereas TNS (described earlier in 
this chapter) is a science-based definition of how to sustain society, Natural 
Capitalism outlines how commerce can transform itself by enhancing value 
through capitalizing on green opportunities.
The sustainability framework of Natural Capitalism evolved out of a 1999 
book of the same name penned by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter 
Lovins. The basic premise of the framework is that not only must business 
quit depleting the Earth’s natural capital (water, minerals, soil, and the like) 
but it must also reinvest in natural capital to replenish and mitigate the 
degradation of the past. Natural Capitalism is a meaningful framework that 
can help guide you in thinking strategically about your business, much like 
Interface, Inc. (the world’s largest commercial flooring covering company), 
which swears by it.
 
This sustainability framework calls for four primary shifts in the way business 
operates:
 
✓ Use new technology to increase resource productivity.
 
✓ Rethink production processes.
 
✓ Move toward a service and flow business model.
 
✓ Invest in natural capital.
All four of these transformations are interdependent and equally vital to 
pursuing sustainable economic development. Together they recognize that 
business depends on environmental and human resources to flourish. The 
deep interrelationship of these resources with financial success is becoming 
increasingly clear. The question of whether to go green or value natural capital 
is being replaced with a new set of questions: How does my company make 
this transition — quickly, efficiently, and with the fewest economic costs?
I explain the four tenets of Natural Capitalism in greater detail in the follow-
ing sections.
Using new technology to increase resource productivity
Natural capital essentially describes one or more of the natural resources 
you rely on to keep the wheels and cogs of your operation running. But 
because natural capital is being used faster than the Earth can replenish it, 

43
 Chapter 3: Preparing to Create Your Sustainability Plan
business must play a part in developing and employing technology that uses 
essential resources like water and wood products many more times effi-
ciently than they currently are.
For example, instead of supplying your headquarters with water by power-
ing pumps to draw even more water from a rapidly depleting aquifer, why 
not design or purchase a system to collect and recycle your rainwater in 
a constant stream? As a result, you’ll have heating, cooling, and flushing 
capacity built into one system — which saves you money in operation and 
repair costs for fancy heating and cooling systems. These reduced costs 
(and accompanying profits!) accrue over time, providing your company with 
the funds needed to further propel innovation associated with increasing 
resource efficiency.
Rethinking production processes
If production processes more clearly emulated nature, there’d be no waste at 
all because nature recycles everything. Every element in nature serves a pur-
pose. From tiny micro-organisms to keystone species (those at the top of the 
feeding chain), every species is part of the intricate and complex ecological 
web. Remove one cog in the wheel (or introduce a non-native species) and 
the biological machine disintegrates. For example, soil becomes sterile when 
nitrogen is removed by mass irrigation and the burning and clearing of grass-
lands and forests before planting (common practices in huge agricultural 
organizations).
Just imagine if your product was made entirely of recycled raw materials so 
that every part of it (including the packaging) could be recycled, resulting in 
zero waste. Strive to turn your business into a closed-loop system where no 
waste is generated by designing a product that can be fully used as raw mate-
rial for another product at the end of its useful life. The savings inherent in 
this business model allow your company to push the sustainability envelope 
even further by challenging product designers to think up new ways to use 
recycled raw materials, thereby decreasing waste-removal expenses and raw 
materials costs.
Moving toward a service and flow business model
Modern society is overly concerned with owning goods, which leads to 
more goods being produced (and thus more natural capital being spent) 
than necessary. Is it really so important for a law firm to own the carpet in 
its commercial building, or do the partners just want the service that a floor 
covering provides? The idea behind a service and flow economy is that pro-
ducers give consumers the service of an item rather than the product itself. 
The producer thus has all sorts of incentives to innovate and recycle, and the 
customer has none of the hassles and all of the utility.

44
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
To go about implementing this business model at your company, you first 
need to consider whether you sell products that you could really lease and 
whether you currently purchase any items for your business that you don’t 
care to own and could lease instead. The benefit of this model is that both 
the producer’s and the consumer’s interests are aligned. For example, Pitney 
Bowes sells the service of processing your company’s mail. The customer 
gets the desired service without owning assets that are unimportant to the 
core business strategy, and the producer has a reason to maximize the pro-
ductivity of existing resources to increase profit.
Investing in natural capital
At one time, natural resource availability seemed boundless — clean water, 
timber, fish, minerals, and the like were harvested with abandon and appeared 
to replenish adequately for more taking. However, the per capita availability 
of all these resources is declining dangerously, putting a strain on commerce 
to find raw material sources to continue production. Capital investments 
in pollution and climate change mitigation, restoration of depleted and 
degraded biological systems, and the expansion of stocks of natural capital 
must occur for continued business sustainability.
Building a Green Team
Ask around any organization that’s actively pursuing sustainability where 
this whole hullaballoo started, and I can guarantee you that many fingers 
will point to one person or a small team of people. You have much to gain by 
identifying these people within your company and bringing them together 
as members of a green team, which is a group of organizational stakeholders 
that establishes, communicates, and measures ecogoals. In a mid-sized com-
pany, a green team should have anywhere from 11 to13 members; more than 
13 becomes unmanageable, and less than 11 can make the effort feel thin and 
unimportant if meetings aren’t fully attended. If you operate a smaller com-
pany, you’ll need to adjust these numbers accordingly.
 
Building and fostering a green team is important for any business, from the 
smallest mom-and-pop shop to the largest of organizations, because employee 
participation is crucial to any long-term, core cultural change — which is pre-
cisely what transitioning to a green business is all about!
Unless someone within your business has sustainability expertise, or you’re 
really super-tight on budget, your green team’s kick-off meeting (and ide-
ally its initial follow-up meeting too) should be facilitated by an external 
sustainability consultant. Many formal planning processes are facilitated by 
a consultant, so don’t worry that this is an unusual request. Note: If budget 
limitations mean all you can afford is one session with the consultant, never 

45
 Chapter 3: Preparing to Create Your Sustainability Plan
fear — you’re still getting a great start. One to two sessions will give your 
green team a great basis for continuing the sustainability-planning process 
on its own.
 
If you’re lucky enough to have an in-house sustainability expert, you can 
forego hiring a consultant and use your internal expertise — and save some 
cash in the process.
The next three sections help you identify and develop change agents to promote 
social and environmental endeavors through proposed business solutions.
Choosing your green team members
Part of selecting your green team members involves knowing what types of 
people to look for, specifically those who are concerned with sustainability 
issues and who display the qualities and skills I outline at the beginning of 
this chapter, in the “Becoming a Sustainable Thinker” section. Keep in mind 
that these green leaders may come from any and all parts of your company. 
Sure, you may find them in such expected departments as environmental 
design or facilities, but you’re just as likely to find them calculating in the 
accounting department or toiling away under a biohood in your research lab.
 
Both passion and position are important — which is more compelling depends 
on your business’s size, corporate culture, structure (centralized versus decen-
tralized), and a host of other organization-specific items. Regardless, the key 
isn’t whether the person has passion or occupies a certain position but that 
he or she has the core personality traits and business-related skills of a sus-
tainable thinker. Potential green team members’ commonality lies in the fact 
that they’re just as (if not more) concerned about your business’s potential 
for doing environmental and societal good as they are about personal wealth 
or career advancement.
 
After you know what types of people to approach, grab an organizational 
chart of your company and sketch out your ideal participants for your green 
team. Try to sketch out positions rather than specific people. If you merely 
target employees who are proven leaders, your green team may not be an 
accurate reflection of your company, and you may overlook your sustainable 
thinkers. Also, by focusing on positions, you can spread the responsibility for 
achieving and maintaining sustainability throughout your company.
If your business is large enough to employ a few people in each of several 
departments, make sure that all business systems are represented (HR, 
accounting, marketing, investor relations, information technology, and so 
on). Operational areas, particularly facilities, purchasing, and product or 
service design, must have a presence as well. If you have managers in place 

46
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
in each department, ask them to nominate at least one person whom they 
supervise for membership on the green team. If no one responds to the 
department’s call for volunteers, ask the department manager to serve as 
the department’s green team representative.
 
Don’t forget to ask one or two highly visible executives to participate. Having 
management onboard can lend credibility to your greening initiative by show-
ing other green team members that top management has bought in to the 
endeavor and is supportive of the team’s time commitment. If your executives 
are unavailable to participate (or perhaps in addition to your execs’ support), 
consider asking a board member who has expressed an interest in pursuing 
sustainability to join the team. Just remember that even if the exec(s) and 
board member(s) can’t commit to the full process, they should be present at 
the kick-off day, as well as at the initial follow-up meeting because green team 
members need to feel that their participation is recognized and supported by 
higher-ups.
Of course, if you employ only a few people (or if you’re all you’ve got), then 
your options are a bit limited. In this case, you may have to rely on a pas-
sionate, proactive person to step up and initiate leadership in effecting green 
change, or you may be forced to mandate that everyone in the company must 
participate on the green team.
Convincing them to come onboard
Getting people to sign on the green dotted line can be a challenge. If your 
company doesn’t have an ecohistory, people may be very unfamiliar and 
therefore unwilling to join the green team. If you’re lucky enough to identify 
sustainable thinkers from your group, use their infectious energy — this is 
your key asset when roping in other green team members.
If you don’t have a sustainability champion or top-management mandate, you 
need to garner interest in the green team by making joining seem
 
✓ Enticing: Try to make the project as relevant to overall corporate well-
being (and by default, individual job security) as possible. Point to com-
petitors or highly admired local companies that have already taken up 
the green torch as examples. Be prepared to offer a small incentive for 
participation in the effort (this expense is included in your sustainability-
planning budget).
 
✓ Easy: Reassure hesitant green team prospects that the green team is 
a steering committee and that project teams for the implementation of 
initiatives will be made up of different people within the organization. 
For example, if the team identifies waste reduction as a cluster group (in 

47
 Chapter 3: Preparing to Create Your Sustainability Plan
other words, a sustainability priority area) during the planning process, 
a project team to spearhead initiatives aimed at assessing and then 
reducing solid waste would be separate from the original green team.
 
 Certainly green team members may participate in project teams, but 
the two teams are not one and the same. Obviously, though, you must 
make the most of your resources, so if you have only a few business 
colleagues, you must distribute responsibilities however seems best for 
your particular situation.
 
✓ Un-time-consuming: Let people know you aren’t forcing them to sign 
their lives away. Ask green team prospects for a nine-month commit-
ment to the planning process — no more, no less.
Although the green team isn’t stuck with implementing every idea, someone 
from within your organization must be willing to oversee the company’s sus-
tainability efforts and serve as the green team leader. Without an identified 
leader, many of these efforts start with great intentions and then fizzle out. 
The green team leader generally spends five hours less per week on his or 
her own job and must be passionate about sustainability planning.
Hiring a consultant to lead the way
A good sustainability consultant can offer your green team a broad educa-
tional overview, including providing an electronic presentation or handouts 
for posting on your company’s intranet site. He or she can also work with 
your green team to start members thinking about the fit between sustainabil-
ity and your organization. This sustainability expert will lead your green team 
through a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analy-
sis of your organization via a sustainability lens. (If your green team members 
have been involved in strategic planning before, they may be happy to once 
again get acquainted with this familiar tool, which I delve into in Chapter 4.)
If you aren’t fortunate enough to have an in-house sustainability expert, 
never fear! Sustainability consultants are readily available in many areas of 
the U.S. (such as the Pacific Northwest, California, Illinois, and Vermont). 
In other places, however, tracking one down may be much more difficult. 
Unfortunately, there isn’t one particular Web site organized by state for the 
purposes of helping business owners find sustainability consultants. There 
are, however, informal networks of people everywhere working toward sus-
tainable business, lifestyles, governments, and communities. Tapping into 
one of these networks is guaranteed to lead you to an expanded web of other 
professionals committed to sustainability in your area.
 
If you prefer to let your fingers do the searching for you, check out these 
Internet search tips to get some leads as to who’s who in sustainability in your 
neck of the woods:

48
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
✓ Type your state’s name and “sustainability consultant” into your favor-
ite Internet search engine and see what you get. Some states have hubs 
where consultants post their practices and client portfolios.
 
✓ Key the name of your area and “sustainable business council” or “local 
business alliance” into Google or another search engine. These types of 
groups are teeming with sustainability aficionados.
 
✓ Type your state’s name and the phrase “businesses for social responsi-
bility” into a search engine. BSR, an international sustainability research 
and consulting organization, has inspired regional networks in many 
states and may be a great resource for finding a sustainability consultant 
in your area.
In many cases, these Web searches may direct you to a university in your area 
that’s working on sustainability projects. Contact the professor or depart-
ment to network your way to someone who’s in the know. I can almost bet 
that after you find someone who’s active in the local sustainability scene, you 
can get the names of folks who may be interested in leading your green team 
through its kick-off and initial follow-up meetings as an external consultant.
 
If your company is housed in a large metropolitan area, one of the big 
four international accounting firms (Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, 
Pricewaterhouse Coopers, and KPMG) may have a sustainability consulting 
division in your city. Get in touch with them to find out.
After you’ve done some research and identified potential consultant(s), make 
sure to do your due diligence by checking on references, asking to see any other 
educational information the prospect may have prepared, and giving his or her 
Web site a thorough once-over. Specifically, ask the following questions:
 
✓ How much real-life sustainability consultant experience does the candi-
date have?
 
✓ What are the candidate’s references? Because no specific accrediting 
agency exists for sustainable business consultants, references and testimo-
nials are particularly important. Look for projects similar in scope to yours.
 
✓ Is the candidate organized, professional, knowledgeable, and pleasant? 
Because this person will be facilitating a collaborative planning session, 
he or she should be likable, articulate, and knowledgeable about both 
sustainability and the planning process.
Budgeting for the Planning Process
 
When you’re ready to take a shot at preparing a budget for the planning pro-
cess, remember this fact: This budget isn’t an implementation budget; it’s 
a budget for the sustainability-planning process. Don’t worry about trying 

49
 Chapter 3: Preparing to Create Your Sustainability Plan
to envision what sorts of initiatives you may want to develop or how much 
they’ll cost. One step at a time!
 
When preparing the planning budget, you must consider two aspects that 
affect your business: the outright financial needs of the planning process and 
the cost of the green team members’ time commitment to the effort. Not pre-
senting a credible planning budget will most certainly undermine your efforts. 
Be thorough in your resource planning and be prepared to stick to it, espe-
cially if you must seek approval for your budget from higher-ups. You don’t 
want to go back and ask the Powers That Be for more moola, so be forthright 
about what you need from the get-go.
Monetary costs
 
Planning to take your company in a new, green direction costs money. Period. 
When budgeting for the planning process, be sure to include the following:
 
✓ Facility costs: These expenses include renting a meeting room and 
bringing in a catering service to supply coffee and/or a meal. If your 
office or warehouse is large enough, you may be able to avoid the cost 
of renting a meeting space.
 
✓ Incentive costs: Plan to pay for small incentives for green team mem-
bers. Don’t break the bank, but do look for incentives that tie back into 
sustainability, like a gift certificate to an area restaurant that features 
locally grown foods.
 
✓ Printing fees: Of course, a sustainable planning session minimizes paper 
usage, but if you absolutely must have a few hard-copy handouts, be 
sure to factor in the cost of printing them.
 
✓ Sustainability consultant–related charges: Factor in the consultant’s 
fees as well as travel and per diem.
 
✓ Technology-related expenses: You’ll mostly likely need a computer, 
LCD panel, screen, and wireless access for the area, so be sure to budget 
in what the meeting site doesn’t offer for free. Also, don’t forget to ask 
your consultant what he or she needs to facilitate.
Time costs
 
Make sure to account for the following in your planning budget:
 
✓ Time cost for meetings: You absolutely have to be upfront and frank 
about green team members’ time commitments. To figure out what 
those should be, multiply some reasonable hourly figure for an average 
employee’s time by the number of hours you plan on having the green 

50
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
team meet per month. Use Figure 3-1 as your guide, based on the size of 
your business. Set a date for your first planning session and allow about 
a half day for it; then plan for a follow-up meeting of about three hours. 
After that, regular meetings should last about one and a half to two hours.

collect baseline data, which is a current assessment of your company’s 
state of sustainability in identified priority areas (see Chapter 4 for more 
information on determining priority areas).
 
✓ Time cost for the team leader to fulfill leadership responsibilities: The 
team leader is in charge of synthesizing information, serving as the coor-
dinator between different cluster groups, working with the consultant 
and Webmaster, and presenting findings on an ongoing basis to execu-
tive management or the board. Typically, this person needs three to five 
hours per week to devote to these tasks.

ustainability is a journey, not a destination. But like any significant 
organizational undertaking, you absolutely have to have a plan in place. 
The purpose of sustainability planning is not only to assess the impact of 
global trends on your business but also to commit to sustainability as a 
creative strategy for dealing with the challenges and opportunities inherent 
in these trends. The result should be a comprehensive and practical tool that 
guides everyone in your company — from top management on down — in 
efforts to green the organization. This chapter helps you formulate your 
sustainability plan. (If you already have a sustainability plan in place for your 
organization and are looking for suggestions on implementing your prioritized 
goals, turn to Part II.)
 
There’s no best place to start your greening efforts. In some organizations, 
sustainability naturally emanates from office practices, because someone in 
the office starts a recycling program and it grows. Sometimes a product engi-
neer comes up with a new design concept that emphasizes green principles 
and the movement expands from there. Regardless of where your sustain-
ability movement begins, everyone in your office should have a triple-bottom-
line consciousness when going about daily office and administrative tasks. 
Thinking simultaneously about people, planet, and profit yields immediate 
cost savings (called low-hanging fruit) and sows the seeds for long-term shifts 
in organizational culture.

Laying the Foundation for Your Plan
Developing a sustainability plan is a far-reaching and often intense process. 
The prep work for it is demanding in and of itself, but it’s crucial to your 
success. Trust me, the time you and your green team spend planning is well 
worth the enhanced efficiency of your greening efforts down the road (not 
to mention the impact this well-thought-out planning will have on your triple 
bottom line). Your sustainability plan does a great deal; it
 
✓ Outlines your areas of focus and your goals within those target areas
 
✓ Identifies the initiatives you’re going to implement and details how to 
execute them
 
✓ Explains how to assess the success of your efforts, thereby allowing you 
to modify your plan based on those assessments
Before you dig in, though, you need to create a green team, a group of 
employees to help guide the planning process, and you need to draw up a 
planning budget to account for the monetary costs, as well as the time costs, 
of planning. Chapter 3 walks you through these early preparatory steps.
 
After you establish a green team and negotiate a budget, you need to follow these 
specific steps, in order, to successfully create an effective sustainability plan:
 
1. Assess your business’s current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, 
and threats from a sustainability perspective.
 
2. Identify target cluster groups.
 
3. Set goals for each cluster group.
 
4. Choose key performance indicators.
 
5. Conduct a baseline assessment with the key performance indicators 
(using external factors as benchmarks for comparison purposes).
 
6. Prioritize your plan goals by assessing the goals’ complexity and your 
current ability to achieve them.
 
7. Outline and prioritize specific initiatives, including approximate costs.
 
8. Communicate your plan to employees and other stakeholders.
After implementing your sustainability plan, you need to spend time assess-
ing the impact of your efforts so that you can modify and reprioritize your 
goals, indicators, and initiatives as necessary for the future. In doing so, 
you’ll probably generate a series of suggestions that are more long-term in 
nature and can be tackled in phases — and that’s a good thing!

53
 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
 
Don’t forget to share the results of your sustainability efforts with all of your 
stakeholders. Celebrate the steps your business has made toward sustain-
ability; communicate the lessons learned from those initiatives that didn’t pro-
duce as you’d hoped; and move on to the new and improved version of your 
sustainability plan.
 
After you go through at least one review cycle for each initiative, you should 
be able to see, pretty clearly, what’s working and what isn’t. For those proj-
ects that are wildly successful, propose formal policies or procedures through 
existing business-system channels to adopt your sustainability initiatives. 
Make sure to involve IT and accounting folk, particularly if your new initiative 
is something you want to scale up and deploy in a cross-departmental way 
(like a sustainable paper purchasing policy, for example).
Now it’s time to jump right in with your green team, get your hands dirty, and 
start writing the plan that will put you on the ecopath to success!
Assessing Your Business’s Current 
State of Sustainability
The first step in creating an effective sustainability plan is multifaceted. It 
involves getting a lay of your business’s green (or not so green) land in order 
to identify which areas you’re already making progress in and which items 
you can improve upon. Understanding where you’re at today allows you to 
look back to this jumping-off point and measure your subsequent success 
accordingly.
For example, if you’re making a case for installing energy-saving “smart strip” 
power strips throughout your office, you want to show that they’ve resulted 
in a decrease in monthly kilowatt usage. To do that, you have to establish a 
gauge (called a baseline) — today’s energy usage. It’s really the same with 
any plan, whether it’s a weight-loss plan, a sustainability plan, or a training 
program for an athletic event. You have to know where you’re coming from in 
order to have a sense for where you’re going
 
The goal of your green team’s first meeting is to develop a broad sustainability 
framework for your organization by conducting a SWOT analysis. This 
strategic-planning tool will help your green team think about the organiza-
tion’s Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats as they relate to 
sustainability.

54
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
A well-executed SWOT analysis allows a green team to
 
✓ Assess the current state of organizational sustainability and produce a 
list of ecostrengths and ecoweaknesses
 
✓ Identify external factors that impact your organization’s green status 
(for example, vendors’, subcontractors’, regulatory agents’ and/or inves-
tors’ policies and procedures) and whether they’ll have a positive or 
negative effect on your business’s overall sustainability plan
The following sections walk you through how to gather the information you 
need to begin your SWOT analysis, as well as how to use this strategic-
planning tool with your green team.
Getting stakeholders’ perception of 
your company’s sustainability
So your green team is assembled, and you’re all sitting around the Energy 
Star–certified laptop with Fair Trade Certified snacks, just looking at each 
other and wondering where to start. Here’s a hint: Because your key stake-
holders are the ones who’ll be evaluating your sustainability progress, go on 
out there and ask them what their problems, concerns, and informational 
needs are.
But who exactly are your key stakeholders? The answer is simple: anyone 
and everyone who’s impacted in any way by your company’s operations, 
products, or facilities — whether inside your company or out. The people 
whom your business impacts the most are the people you want to mine for 
information and advice. They’re not only your target audience but also your 
collaborators. Projects evolve with stakeholders as you bring them into the 
process. For example, you may decide to institute a project with suppliers to 
green your raw material lines, or to team up with your community’s leaders 
to bring renewable energy sources to your area.
 
Asking people for their opinions implies that you’re eventually going to ade-
quately address their concerns — so don’t ask if you don’t have a vision for 
ensuring quality stakeholder engagement and aren’t ready to follow through! 
No, a particular problem or issue won’t automatically be off the ol’ to-do list 
by next week, but by talking with both internal and external folks, you can 
better set targets to improve upon and come up with a reasonable way to 
measure how you’re doing.
Deciding whom to talk to
You certainly can talk to just about anyone, but your results will be more 
effective if you brainstorm whom you think should be consulted within each 
of the following stakeholder groups:

55
 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
 
✓ Employees: Are you going to approach all employees, including part-
time, temporary, and fresh-in-the-door type folks? Or only full-timers 
with a year or more under their belts? Do you want to include inde-
pendent contractors who do significant work for your company but 
aren’t on the actual payroll, as well as trade union reps?
 
 Which specific employees you talk to isn’t as important as ensuring you 
have far-reaching representation that includes employees who have 
varying influence levels and are from different departments. Because 
greening your business may impact many aspects of employees’ work 
lives, you must solicit and value their opinions.
 
✓ Suppliers: Are you going to reach out to each and every one of your sup-
pliers? Engaging your key suppliers in the input process is critical. You can 
determine who your key suppliers are by either setting an actual minimum 
dollar amount of annual business or establishing a percentage of inventory 
purchased from them. As you continue to grow your greening efforts, you 
may establish supplier programs that reward their green behavior.
 
✓ Shareholders, investors, and creditors: It may be too much to ask to 
approach every single shareholder, investor, and creditor, so how do 
you decide who to include? Anyone who has a material and vested finan-
cial interest in your organization should be party to the input stage. Who 
exactly that is is up to you to define. You can establish percentage of 
ownership (say 5 percent or greater) as the parameter, or you can con-
sider how long they’ve held an investment in your company. If you don’t 
have an inordinate number of shareholders, investors, or creditors, feel 
free to engage them all, as time permits.
 
✓ Customers: Do you approach everyone who’s ever purchased a prod-
uct or service from you, or only those who’ve been repeat customers? 
Again, you need to decide the scope of the input you want. If four or five 
customers constitute 70 percent of your revenue, that’s pretty clear-
cut. On the other hand, if your revenue base is comprised of thousands 
of smallish transactions, a random sample of your customers might be 
more appropriate. Ideally, you’re already tuned in to your customers’ 
needs and concerns regarding your company. But this is your chance 
to really expand that conversation and let them have some free-form 
dialogue surrounding what they want to see as far as your company’s 
environmental and social performance.
 
✓ Community members: Are you planning on talking to your nonprofit 
partners, city government leaders, and local business organizations? 
What about business professors at universities and colleges in your 
town? (After all, kids in the classroom today will be businesspeople in 
your community very soon.) You can glean some very interesting infor-
mation regarding your company’s impact on the community that you do 
business in by engaging in dialogue with these folks.
 
Having a way to record and organize your chosen stakeholders’ responses is 
important, too. Be sure to iron out the system that works for your green team 
before contacting anyone.

56
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Getting what you need from them
After pulling together your working list of targeted key stakeholders, discuss 
your environmental and social goals with them so that they have some idea 
that you have a sustainability vision that holds their best interests (and the 
community’s) paramount. By having everyone on the same page, your stake-
holders can respond to you with confidence. Also, if your targeted stakehold-
ers don’t have a working knowledge of sustainable business performance, 
you may want to provide them with a list of potential key performance indica-
tors (KPIs) and state what you’re trying to accomplish by measuring each of 
them. Then ask stakeholders to rank the KPIs by importance or comment on 
them in a scaled format.
After educating these stakeholders a bit about sustainability, you can ask a 
variety of questions with the goal of getting the answer to one essential ques-
tion: “What are your concerns regarding social, environmental, and economic 
issues as they relate to our company?”
 
You may need to draw stakeholders into the conversation by mentioning 
issues that have general social or environmental relevance. It’s important, 
however, not to lead them by mentioning specific items of concern — doing 
so would invalidate the input process. So, even if water conservation is very 
important to you, don’t guide stakeholders’ input by asking, “Is water conser-
vation an area of concern for you?”
Allow stakeholders enough time to answer questions that are applicable to 
your industry sector in regards to the triple bottom line. Also, be sure to 
offer them an opportunity to talk about any topic in a free-flow format.
 
If you have quite a large group of key stakeholders to chat with, you may want 
to provide them with an electronic copy of the questions so they can type out 
their key topics and concerns. If, however, you’re a privately held company 
with, say, a working capital line of credit at the local bank, obviously this par-
ticular stakeholder dialogue would occur in a more informal setting. You want 
the bank’s input on what sorts of performance indicators it may look to in 
order to assess how you’re doing.
 
A combination of informal and formal surveys and focus groups may be the 
best way to gather customer input, specifically. You may be surprised to find 
out that a bunch of your customers want sustainable decking or fencing mate-
rials because they’re tired of the upkeep on traditional products, or that more 
folks than you thought are willing to pay a premium for products made in 
North America.
Be sure to document your responses from the various stakeholder groups 
and take time to outline their main points of concern. You don’t need to men-
tion every single suggestion or complaint you received. Instead, focus on 
those points that were repeated enough times among the various groups to 
identify them as bona fide focus areas. Note: This is the summarized input 
you’ll work from as you move into the SWOT-analysis process.

57
 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
 
A quick follow-up after your stakeholder meeting is crucial. Make sure to 
thank each participant for his or her input. After all, engaging with stakehold-
ers shows that you care about their concerns and rights; responding shows 
that you have a desire for them to flourish as a result of your operations.
Conducting a SWOT analysis 
with your green team
Every business consultant, sustainability-minded ones included, has a differ-
ent style and technique for facilitating a SWOT analysis. The sustainability 
consultant you hire will probably lead your green team to consider each of 
the SWOT quadrants in an open and informal style and will likely use the 
chart shown in Figure 4-1 to get the group thinking about what’s going on 
inside and outside the business from both positive and negative standpoints. 
If people are stumped and conversation dies down, the sustainability consul-
tant can easily offer ideas to capture sustainable organizational attributes in 
each of the areas.
After the consultant has guided your group through this process, he or she 
will merge the summarized input from your stakeholders (which you gather 
as described in the earlier section “Getting stakeholders’ perception of your 
company’s sustainability”) to the appropriate quadrants. The consultant will 
have had access to the stakeholders’ results in advance of the meeting and 
will have compiled comments in a cohesive way to prepare for this analysis. 
What emerges is thus a visual synthesis of internal and external input.
A solid SWOT analysis is guaranteed to produce good ideas about where to 
target your company’s sustainability endeavors. Your consultant will lead 
you through the quadrants with a solid explanation of how to define each 
item and what their differentiating characteristics are, but a brief definition of 
each quadrant follows:
 
✓ Strengths: Your organizational strengths are internally embedded 
attributes that will be helpful to achieving your sustainability goals, for 
example a corporate commitment to using nontoxic raw materials.
 
✓ Weaknesses: Your organizational weaknesses are internally embedded 
attributes that may be harmful to achieving your green objectives, such 
as significant investment in equipment that can’t easily be converted 
to manufacture green products (think about automobile manufacturers 
trying to recalibrate production toward hybrids).
 
✓ Opportunities: Your organizational opportunities are external factors 
that will be helpful in achieving your sustainability goals, for example 
the ready availability of high-quality local raw materials as an alternative 
to materials that have to travel thousands of miles to your facility.

✓ Threats: Your organizational threats are external aspects that may be 
harmful to achieving your eco-objectives, for example, a lack of recy-
cling facilities in your area.

Identifying Target Cluster Groups
After you assess your business’s current state of sustainability (head back to 
that earlier section if you skipped this important step), you need to identify 
cluster groups, also known as sustainability priority areas, that you want to 
target. These groups serve as a green framework for outlining your goals.
Each cluster group should be broadly identified, but designated with some 
forethought given to how you’re going to assess performance in that arena. 
Following is a list of some common cluster groups, most of which are appli-
cable to any business. Be careful, though, not to choose a cluster group from 

59
 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
this list just because it’s common — the groups you choose should be impor-
tant to your company.
 
✓ Customers and community
 
✓ Employees and workplace
 
✓ Environmental impact
 
✓ Organizational governance
 
✓ Sustainability education and communication
 
✓ Supply chain management
Because every company is unique in its scope, location, operating environ-
ment, and limitations, you may find additional cluster groups that are appro-
priate to your line of business. The possibilities are limitless, which is why I 
can’t offer all the suggestions. Simply consider the most common groups; if 
additional ideas spring to mind, add them. If not, don’t try to force ’em.
Setting Goals within Each Cluster Group
If you have a good idea of the cluster groups you want to address, you can 
set specific goals within each of these priority areas. Think about what kind 
of goals you can set in relation to the cluster groups you’ve already identified 
for your organization. This is your (and your employees’) chance to put your 
thought process into action — these goals will be the concrete catalysts for 
change within your organization.
If budget allows, you may choose to have the sustainability consultant walk 
you through this process as well. If resources are tight, have the consultant 
focus on facilitating your SWOT analysis (a process described earlier in this 
chapter).
 
Though setting a lot of sky-high goals is a swell way to spend an afternoon 
around the conference table, eventually you have to drill down to what’s most 
important and achievable for your company. Make a final decision on goals 
based on what’s attainable within your company’s resources of time, talent, 
and treasure.
 
Your green team should be careful to include all pertinent goals, even if some 
of them feel very lofty or long-range or don’t fit with other goals.
The SWOT analysis left you with four lists, one from each of the quadrants, 
focusing on your business’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and 
threats. Refer to these lists when considering solutions to the following four 
questions:

60
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
✓ How can the internal strengths be used to set the sustainability agenda? 
Build on the sustainable activities your business is already engaging in. 
For example, if one of your business’s strengths is that your current prod-
uct line already features complementary green products, “more rapidly 
expanding green product line” may be at the top of your sustainability 
to-do list.
 
✓ How can the internal sustainability weaknesses be converted to 
strengths? A typical weakness for companies that are just dipping their 
toes into ecowaters is a lack of knowledge about what exactly “going 
green” entails. If your green team identifies lack of employee knowledge 
as a weakness toward achieving your sustainability objective, counter 
that by deciding to set “developing employee sustainability education 
plan” as one of your paramount goals.
 
✓ How can each external opportunity be expanded into action? Look 
to the outside stimulus for ideas on how to expand your green plan. For 
example, if one opportunity is a strong community recycling program, 
reducing solid waste by 25 percent within 24 months may be a viable goal.
 
✓ How can we creatively deflect each external threat? External threats 
often come from city, state, and federal regulations, or demands from inves-
tors and shareholders. If your state is very close to instituting a carbon tax 
and you’re a long way from being carbon neutral (like many businesses), 
brainstorm the kinds of immediate action can you take to reduce your com-
pany’s carbon emissions by 15 percent within 24 months.
 
Because each organization’s culture differs widely, only you know how read-
ily the green team’s sustainability ideas will be accepted by staff. Is your 
company into brainstorming sessions and creative visioning? If so, you’re in 
luck — possibilities are darn near limitless and solutions may emerge quickly 
more often than not. Alternatively, is your business chock-full of the “we’ve 
always done it this way” folks? Then finding out your colleagues’ concerns and 
using them as a basis for project development is essential (and something you 
should’ve already accomplished in the “Assessing Your Business’s Current 
State of Sustainability” step).
 
If your green team has trouble thinking up sustainable goals and opportuni-
ties, suggest members tap into the best resource available — their co-workers! 
Some of the best ideas come from the folks on the front line. They see waste, 
inefficiencies, stakeholder dissatisfaction, and bear the burden of regulatory 
compliance. Ask them how they view the goals you’ve outlined. What would 
they change, add, delete? These folks can also be instrumental in helping your 
green team finalize goals before moving on.
Each goal must begin with an action verb to clearly identify that it’s an active 
goal you want to pursue and not just a theoretical concept. Check out Figure 
4-2 for some examples to get you thinking.

Conjuring up a name for your planning effort is a good idea at this point. Is it a 
Sustainability Strategic Plan or a Triple Bottom Line Plan? Whatever name you 
prefer, it should be something you imagine will resonate with all stakeholders.
 
Seeing whether your company has any peer groups that are engaged in sus-
tainability planning or reporting is worthwhile — after all, they may be a 
source for great benchmarks, external factors against which to measure your 
performance. For example, if you’re a small utility, check out Seattle City 
Light’s Sustainability Plan. If you’re a retailer, take a peek at Wal-Mart’s 
published sustainability plan, complete with a sustainability progress update. 
To see who’s doing what out there, look to your trade association’s Web site 
and print materials, or do an Internet search on your industry and the phrase 
“sustainability plan.”

Choosing Key Performance Indicators
The fourth step in creating your sustainability plan is all about determining 
your key performance indicators (KPIs), a series of metrics that your green 
team will use to help define and measure your business’s progress toward 
each sustainability goal set in the third step (see the preceding section for 
more on goal-setting). Your company’s KPIs should reflect the concerns 
stakeholders have expressed that may not yet be incorporated in the sustain-
ability plan.
Identifying KPIs is consistent with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) 
standards for sustainability reporting and will help you way down the road 
when you reach the point of reporting your sustainability progress. See 
Chapter 16 for more details on the GRI and sustainability reporting.
In the following sections, I familiarize you with some of the most common 
performance indicators, explain how to develop your broad list of options, 
show you how to select the right KPIs for your business, and help you figure 
out how to handle KPIs that seem to conflict with each other. Because of the 
lack of developed frameworks and systems in this area, you may find that 
you can soon add the title “trailblazer” to your résumé!
Recognizing common types 
of performance indicators
Performance indicators are often developed to help companies measure 
efforts toward broad organizational goals that are sometimes difficult to 
quantify. Typically, they fall into one of three main categories: ecological, 
social, and economic. As you strive to develop KPIs within each category, it 
may be easiest to think of them by mentally referencing traditional financial 
indicators. For example, a conventional economic objective is to increase 
shareholder wealth. Indicators of this objective are items such as net income 
and earnings per share.
I delve into the three categories of indicators as they relate to the triple 
bottom line in the next few sections.
Ecological indicators
Ecological indicators communicate your company’s environmental dimension. 
They demonstrate whether your business is environmentally sustainable and 
gauge your level of impact on the Earth’s ecological systems (biodiversity, 
water, air, and land). Ecological indicators are quantifiable and are generally 
based on scientific principles and guidance.

63
 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
Your choice of ecological indicators is very dependent on your type of com-
pany, but should address (or at least acknowledge if you haven’t started 
working on them yet) the following aspects:
 
✓ Energy, water, and waste
 
✓ Biodiversity
 
✓ Products and services
 
✓ Transportation of people and products
 
✓ Regulatory issues
 
Make sure to keep your ecological indicators highly relevant to stated stake-
holder objectives. If reducing greenhouse gases weighs heavily on stake-
holders’ minds, state your objective as “reduction of carbon emissions by 15 
percent by the year 2015.” Your indicator would most likely be tons of carbon 
dioxide emitted or carbon emitted per dollar of sales.
Social indicators
Social indicators convey the impact of your organization on the social sys-
tems within which your business operates. They address your social 
sustainability and how your company contributes to society’s quality of life, 
community improvement, and human rights enhancement. Social indicators 
are based on either quantitative or qualitative data and often are formulated 
in response to commentary from stakeholders.
Social indicators may address items such as the following:
 
✓ Organizational governance and transparency
 
✓ Diversity and equality in the workplace
 
✓ Health, safety, and welfare in the workplace
 
✓ Societal impact of operations
 
✓ Human rights
 
✓ Nonprofit collaborations
 
✓ Sustainable purchasing, including suppliers’ ethics and green practices
 
Presenting your company’s social performance on a scale is acceptable. For 
example, if your stakeholders tell you that a key area of concern is to increase 
employee work-life balance, your corresponding social indicator may be 
employee level of satisfaction. A score of 0 shows no satisfaction, whereas 4 
reveals a very high level of satisfaction.

64
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Economic indicators
Economic indicators communicate your company’s ability to be financially 
sustainable and are generally based on quantitative data. This is where you 
look to financial beacons to tell your story. They’re usually the most familiar 
to readers. Although individual organizational economic indicators, such as 
sales growth, net income, and market share, illustrate the primary economic 
impacts of your company, key stakeholders may be interested in a wide 
range of economic indicators that have broader sustainability implications, 
such as
 
✓ Percentage of inventory purchases that come from local suppliers.
 
✓ Percentage of gross or net income that you donate to your community. 
How does that compare to the last three years? What’s your target for 
next year?
 
✓ The compensation matrix and how that fits with local living wage 
estimates.
 
✓ Government subsidies, credits, or programs that you’re involved in.
 
✓ Supplier relations, including timely payment, long-term relationships, 
and supplier satisfaction with the relationship.
For example, how does your organization contribute to overall community 
economic development or industry-sector sustenance? If your cement plant 
is a key employer in your area, what are the future impacts of increased 
green-building techniques?
Developing your broad list of KPIs
Finding the most efficient KPIs and establishing the appropriate ones for your 
ecological, social, and economic goals may require some outside research 
and consultation in order to determine the metric option that works best 
for your company’s needs. For example, say you operate a company in the 
Southwest. Chances are water usage bubbles up as one of your areas of con-
cern. What’s the best way to measure your company’s current water usage? 
Is it charting your last 24 months of water bills on a spreadsheet? Or if you 
run a sales-focused operation out in the suburbs, how best can you approach 
calculating employees’ emissions from company travel and commuting? On a 
per-employee basis? By carbon emitted per sales dollar? Research how other 
companies are measuring ratios of emissions to number of employees.
According to conventional wisdom, KPIs should meet a number of criteria 
referred to as SMART, which stands for
 
✓ Specific: They need to directly identify the metric. Something like 
“energy usage” is inadequate, whereas “average kilowatts used per 
month over prior 18 months” is appropriate.

65
 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
 
✓ Measurable: They need to be broken into discrete areas that can be 
calculated. A KPI such as “human rights” should be broken down into 
something like “number of foreign manufacturing plants that have third-
party certification.”
 
✓ Achievable: They must look credible. If a KPI addresses the number of 
employees telecommuting, but there’s no program in place to allow tele-
commuting, that isn’t very achievable.
 
✓ Realistic: They should look authentic. Reducing water consumption 
to zero is probably unrealistic; reducing paper usage to zero may be 
entirely possible.
 
✓ Timely: Some KPIs need to specifically address the time period over 
which they’ll be measured. In order to show triple-bottom-line trends, 
your accounting team may come up with metrics that can be measured 
over time such as
 
• Carbon emitted per unit sold
 
• Energy usage per square footage of facilities
 
• Greenhouse gas emissions per employee
 
• Miles traveled per unit of product sold
 
• Number of hours of volunteer service provided in the community
 
• Waste created per square footage of facilities
Feel free to jot down multiple KPIs for any given concern or issue. Your green 
team can winnow them down as it goes. For example, if a focus group of key sup-
plier stakeholders has expressed concern that your company doesn’t adequately 
source from certified minority and/or women-owned businesses, your task is to 
figure out what measurement ties directly into this objective. Number of certified 
suppliers? Dollars spent with these suppliers? Ratio of certified suppliers to all 
suppliers? Try on a few KPIs to see what fits best with your situation.
 
In my experience, economic KPIs are fairly easy to establish because that’s 
what traditional business models are generally based on. Environmental KPIs 
are almost always wrapped around measuring water, waste, and energy usage. 
However, people seem to get stuck on how to develop social KPIs. Looking for 
ideas in existing documents and program plans may help. Check out your
 
✓ Employment policies and guidelines
 
✓ Programs you’re implementing to improve verification of labor 
practices, particularly in foreign countries
 
✓ Plans to enhance the health and safety of your employees and supply chain
 
✓ Employee training, career advancement, and educational opportunities
 
✓ Formal diversity and tolerance policies (ratios are often a good way to 
present this data)

66
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
Consider having discussions with stakeholders as you go. For example, if 
you’re trying to determine how to measure progress toward serving disadvan-
taged customers, try asking the customers who fall into that category. What 
do they believe would be indicative of success for that goal? More services? 
Expanded hours? Dedicated help lines? Use information gleaned from stake-
holders to help direct the development of your KPIs.
Selecting your KPIs
The quality of your KPIs is critical, because these are the metrics you use to 
measure your success, so plan to spend more than one meeting selecting the 
KPIs you’re going to incorporate into your sustainability plan.
The key to selecting the right KPIs from your broad list of possibilities is to 
make sure you’re not overzealous when initially outlining them. Because 
each cluster group contains multiple goals, you may have more than one KPI 
per goal. However, fewer and well-thought-out KPIs are much more desirable 
than a whole litany of them. For a sample of how you can organize goals and 
KPIs in each cluster group, take a look at Figure 4-3. (As for using your KPIs to 
measure your company’s progress, turn to Chapter 15.)

 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
 
The number of KPIs isn’t nearly as important as making sure you have the right 
ones. Quality over quantity is the motto. There’s no right or wrong here — the 
hope is that your green team members have generated significant discussion 
to flesh out the most important points and engaged in research when needed 
to get you to this point.
 
For expediency’s sake, you may want to break your green team into two groups 
at this point, each tackling half of the cluster groups identified by the green 
team as a whole. Because your green team is cross-functional (meaning it fea-
tures members from various departments), expect each department’s represen-
tative to brainstorm ideas that relate to his or her respective area of expertise.
 
The KPIs your green team is generating aren’t engraved in gold. They may change 
and evolve as the team delves further into the sustainability-planning process.
Addressing conflicting KPIs
As you start compiling a list of your chosen KPIs, situations can arise in which 
they’re at odds. This occurrence means that a tactic designed to increase 
results from one KPI may adversely affect another one, and improving that 
one may mean impeding another’s progress. In the following example, one 
KPI is market share percentage, and another is pounds of nonrecyclable 
packaging used. To increase the market share of your small microelectronics 
manufacturing firm, you have to scale up your distribution chain. Suppose 
a national big-box store wants to carry your product, but in order to ship it 
over long distances, you need to add a layer of protective packaging. Reduced 
packaging and increased market share is an example of conflicting KPIs.
Determining which KPI should be pursued may well be one of the first tests 
of your triple-bottom-line thinking. In a traditional business model, the deci-
sion that increases the economic bottom line is given more weight than other 
factors. However, a sustainable planning process necessitates that you have 
a more balanced approach to economic, social, and environmental indica-
tors. When KPIs are at odds, look back to your evolving sustainability plan 
and attempt to balance your judgment with your stakeholders’ input to see 
whether you can find a way to reconcile the benefits of each KPI.
Conducting a Baseline Assessment with 
Your Key Performance Indicators
The next step is gathering data and conducting a baseline assessment of your 
current performance in regard to each of your goals. This assessment is more 
specific than your SWOT analysis (which simply allows you to determine 

68
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
your business’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as they 
relate to sustainability). In this step, you’re using your chosen key perfor-
mance indicators (KPIs) to provide an overview of your sustainability perfor-
mance, thereby allowing you to identify which goals need the most attention 
and in what order.
At the same time, the baseline assessment helps you see whether the KPIs 
you’ve chosen are truly reliable. Assessing them is vital to your initial plan-
ning stage, because your KPIs are the cornerstone of your plan.
Gathering internal data for the assessment
Compiling baseline data may seem like an overwhelming process. If you’re 
interested in enhancing work-life balance, you need to establish a baseline as 
to current level of satisfaction. If you want to push your locally made product 
line, understanding the level of customer interest is critical. In these scenarios, 
you have to gather data. In some instances, though, utilities or local waste 
management facilities are willing to conduct appraisals, assessments, or audits 
regarding water usage, waste output, or energy usage (usually for free).
 
When you gather data, make sure it’s valid; you’ll use it in the future for moni-
toring your progress and ultimately reporting on your results. (Chapter 15 
explains how to ensure the validity of your data.)
 
If interest is starting to wane, or collection of data for all of your KPIs looks to 
be too great a task, then feel free to prioritize a few goals within each cluster 
group and go after the baseline data for the associated KPIs.
Chances are not all of your KPIs will have accessible quantitative data, so you 
have to build in time for the green team to accurately accumulate it. Be pre-
pared to do the legwork or pay someone else to do the data mining for you.
 
If you decide not to gather baseline data for all KPIs, don’t despair! The work 
you’ve already done identifying them won’t be lost; it’ll still be there for future 
development. Make sure to keep the planning process fluid and responsive 
to green team members’ concerns relating to time or scope constraints so no 
one burns out.
Using external factors as benchmarks
As you gather data, you may run into some gold standards known as 
benchmarks — external factors (such as standards or performance param-
eters) against which you can measure your own company’s results. After you 
name the benchmarks against which you’re measuring your success, you can 
create some targets and goals in the short term (upcoming year) and interim 

69
 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
targets for longer-term goals. By using external benchmarks, you can strive 
for results that are already out there and help your stakeholders see how 
you’re doing in comparison to others.
For example, scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) agree that in order to stabilize the Earth’s temperature, greenhouse 
gas emissions must be reduced by 80 percent by the year 2050. This is the 
benchmark you can use to evaluate your company’s performance in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Many sustainability goals don’t have specific benchmarks available because 
they’re unique to your company. Depending on your industry sector, how-
ever, common benchmarks you may want to consider are as follows:
 
✓ Specific third-party certification of materials, processes, or products 
(for example, wood purchased from Forest Stewardship Council–certified 
sources or an Environmental Management System that’s ISO14001 
compliant)
 
✓ International greenhouse gas reduction standards
 
✓ Widely held goals such as zero waste
 
✓ Facilities standards such as LEED (U.S.) or Green Globe (Canada)
 
✓ Local or regional green awards or standards
 
✓ Regional data on employee performance, productivity, or healthfulness
Rating your performance 
according to your KPIs
After you identify a KPI and gather the data that pertains to it, you can score 
your organization’s performance in that particular KPI via a simple scale. To 
make the rating objective, try to work out a mathematical score (see Figure 4-4 
for an example). If you’re not quite sure how your performance scores against 
a chosen benchmark, use your collective, albeit subjective, green team judg-
ment to give it a score.
When you rate a KPI, use the following simple scale:
 
✓ 1 – Way below-average performance.
 
✓ 2 – Below-average performance, or no data available. (If no data is avail-
able for your indicator, give it a 2 [which is standard].)
 
✓ 3 – Average performance, complies with regulations. Used to establish 
baseline for first year and assumed to be on par with peer-group 
performance.

70
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
✓ 4 – Above-average performance.
 
✓ 5 – Superior performance.
Figure 4-4 identifies what sorts of benchmarks may be appropriate for your 
evaluation purposes and shows how you might rate and assess your KPIs. 
As you find benchmarks that can help you look more intimately at how your 
KPIs are performing, drop that info into the corresponding column. (Note: 
Benchmarks aren’t necessarily available for each KPI you come up with.) In 
the next column, you should evaluate how your KPI is performing compared 
to your chosen benchmark. You can then rate each baseline assessment 
according to the previously provided scale. (If no benchmark exists, standard 
practice is to assign a rating of 2.0.)

Summarizing your findings
After you’ve gone through the rating process, average the ratings for each of 
the cluster groups and summarize your findings so you can include a brief 
snapshot of each in your final plan. The summary of your baseline assess-
ment should show each cluster group with specific goals, KPIs, and current 
scores using those indicators. The format should look similar to what you see 
in Figure 4-5.

3.6 + 1.8 2
Prioritizing Your Goals
After conducting a baseline assessment of your key performance indicators 
(KPIs), your green team can easily see which goals take priority and demand 
immediate attention (those with the lowest score need the greatest amount 
of improvement). The order in which you plan to tackle them, however, 
doesn’t solely depend on need for improvement.
When you prioritize your goals, you assess them from a holistic perspec-
tive by looking at their complexity, your current ability to achieve them, and 
other similar factors that provide a realistic vantage point. I suggest that 
you use a simple rating scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being “none or not at all” and 5 
being “a lot or significant,” to address the following questions:
 
✓ How much of the goal do you think can be accomplished with existing 
resources?
 
✓ How critical is this issue to your company’s core mission?

72
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
✓ How much risk does your company incur if you don’t move on this issue?
 
✓ How important is this issue to external stakeholders?
 
 You may need to do some broad research to adequately answer this 
question. Choose three employees, three vendors, and three community 
members and provide them with a copy of your current KPIs and baseline 
data (without the scores) and ask them to first prioritize goals within each 
cluster group and then prioritize the cluster groups themselves.
Assigning scores based on this scale gives you a rudimentary prioritization of 
your sustainability goals, as well as a clear idea of how you’re currently doing 
on each of those goals. Well done!
Identifying Specific Initiatives
If you’ve made it this far, you’re in the home stretch of creating your sustain-
ability plan. You’ve outlined and prioritized all of your goals, so now you 
just need to create and prioritize the specific initiatives you’ll take to work 
toward those goals. Depending on the size of your organization, you may 
decide to tackle one cluster group thoroughly and split the prioritized goals 
among working groups. Or you may choose to target one or two goals in each 
of your cluster groups.
This decision is a tactical one that you must make based on your earlier pri-
oritization of goals (see the preceding section), as well as your take on the 
culture in which you operate. For example, if you know you’re going to get 
a lot of internal resistance to auditing foreign manufacturing firms for labor 
standards compliance, don’t start there. If you’ve heard a ton of grumbling 
about needing to improve your office’s energy efficiency, then do start there.
The next few sections explain how to brainstorm ideas for specific initiatives, 
work out the details of each one, and then prioritize them according to your 
company’s needs.
Brainstorming ideas
My first piece of advice when brainstorming about specific programs and 
initiatives is to go for it — nothing is off limits, and nothing is too far out. My 
second piece of advice is to be realistic. Obviously, your company’s set of 
initiatives will be unique to your organization in terms of scope and focus. So 
consider factors such as implementation costs and reaction from management 
and employees. How is it possible to consider both? Realistically, if you come

 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
forward right now with a series of recommendations that are going to cost a 
ton and seem pretty out there to your average Jane or Joe, they won’t fly.
 
Keep cost in mind as you move into discussions at this stage, noting that 
today’s far-fetched ideas may be attainable in a few years’ time. Make sure 
you capture all the ideas on paper, even if some of them will clearly be tucked 
away until a later date. Recording every idea keeps your green team’s synergy 
in motion.
Based on how many folks are on your green team and where the areas of 
interest are consolidated, split the team into two to three working groups 
to develop specific sustainability initiatives. Don’t forget to include team 
members’ individual knowledge bases when divvying people into groups. For 
example, your facilities person is the best person to address greenhouse gas 
emissions from your plant, whereas your HR rep is the best person to review 
your labor rights cluster group.
 
Prior to breaking into working groups, distribute a template for documenting 
initiative ideas and estimating the approximate costs and savings of those 
ideas. When you reunite to consolidate your ideas, everything will look the 
same in your word-processing software and spreadsheets.
Say for example, that two of your goals were flagged in the prioritization pro-
cess and that the individual working group you’re in is given the responsibil-
ity for suggesting initiatives that will help you to achieve these two specific 
goals. You can create a summary table of what you already know (like the 
one shown in Figure 4-6) to better evaluate which initiative ideas are most 
appropriate for immediate implementation.

After you take a look at the summarized information, determine where a good 
point of entry is. For example, if you have plans in place to upgrade your fleet, 
that’s a great arena for easing your sustainability plan into action because 
you’ve already identified that action as a specific goal. If the goal doesn’t 
coincide with current strategic priorities, establish ways to impact it with-
in your resource constraints. For example, are there options to use rail or 
modify your logistics to minimize the distance needed to transport products?
 
Your working group members may or may not have any expertise in the area 
you’ve been assigned to investigate, so be ready to rely on further investiga-
tion or on the knowledge of other employees and stakeholders.
Continuing with the preceding example, if you do have the logistics person 
in your working group (lucky you!), he or she can provide an overview of the 
issues surrounding product transportation. If you don’t have this internal 
expertise, your working group needs to bring the logistics person in for a 
consultation.
 
Be sure to consider the following when you’re brainstorming possible 
initiatives:
 
✓ Outline pertinent questions. In this example, you may ask how many 
trucks, what kind of trucks, how many miles per year are driven, how 
many average miles does each unit of product travel, where are distribu-
tion centers, are there alternatives, what are the costs, and so on.
 
✓ Research what other companies have done. Check out big delivery 
companies’ Web sites to view their sustainable transportation plans. 
Your working group should be creative in exploring ideas and suggest-
ing where to make inquiries. Assign specific legs of research to different 
team members and then reassemble and share what you’ve discovered 
and the ideas you’ve come up with.
 
✓ Set realistic expectations. Clearly, you need to set interim targets for 
each year to attain long-term goals. If you’re trying to reduce your 
greenhouse gas emissions, for example, begin by establishing modest 
percentage-reduction goals (such as 2 percent reduction per year) that 
are attainable through conservation and the use of today’s technology, 
realizing that you’re aiming toward targets farther down the road.
 
Sustainability initiatives shouldn’t be long, convoluted, or important sound-
ing. Instead, they should be quite concise and include very specific items like: 
“Replace current distribution fleet with hybrid alternatives over the next ten 
years.” Keep your language simple upfront so you can then expound on the 
thought behind the initiative.
At this point, the diligent efforts of the various working groups will have 
resulted in small start-up projects. You should also have a list of more 
comprehensive initiatives for the identified priority goals.

 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
Selecting the best initiatives 
from your brainstormed list
After you create a list of possible initiatives, you need to select those that 
will reap the most benefit for the triple bottom line because they’re the ones 
you’ll move forward with. The next two sections show you the two options 
most businesses use.
Getting a visual cue: Plotting cost against 
overall sustainability benefit
A rudimentary way to analyze sustainability projects is to construct a visual 
graph. Name the x-axis Cost and the y-axis Sustainability Impact. Then, based 
on estimated costs and perceived sustainability benefit, label where pro-
posed projects belong on the graph. Finally, using the bubbles in Figure 4-7 
as a guide, decide which initiatives to move forward with and when.

Number crunching: Assessing the weighted 
average of the triple-bottom-line benefit
One good way of analyzing initiative options within the context of how they’ll 
benefit the triple bottom line is to use a simple weighted-average criteria chart.
 
1. Create a chart like the one in Figure 4-8 with the initiative options 
you’re considering as the column heads following the TBL Criteria 
and Weight of TBL Criteria columns.
 
 In this example, the three initiative options are meant to increase the 
efficiency of a business’s fleet.

76
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
2. Allocate a weight to each aspect of the triple bottom line (based on a 1 
to 10 scale, with 1 being least important and 10 being most important) 
based on which aspect is of chief concern to your company for the 
particular initiative in question.
 
 The business in this scenario determined that the impact on profit was 
its top concern, so they rated that a 10. Planet was the next concern for 
this efficiency-related goal, so it received a 7. The impact on people was 
important but not critical, so it got a 2 — reflective that in this example, 
there isn’t much effect on people.
 
3. Evaluate each option against the impact on people, planet, and profit, 
assigning a numerical score to each.
 
 This score is obviously subjective, but it helps you to succinctly com-
pare each of the three options to each other. When used in combination 
with the weight you place on each of the elements of the triple bottom 
line, you have a mathematically deeper analysis than just a simple 
straight ranking.
 
 Don’t mire yourself down in statistical detail here. This chart is a fore-
cast and, as such, is simply an educated guess.
 
4. Multiply the weight of each TBL criteria by the weight of each option.
 
 Record the result within the gray box that corresponds with that TBL 
criteria and the option in question. So, for example, People is assigned 
a weight of 2, and in Option 1, it’s multiplied by 5 for a score of 10. In 
Option 2, the weight of People is multiplied by 0 to get 0, and in Option 3, 
it’s multiplied by 10 to get 20. Work through the same process with the 
remaining TBL criteria.
 
5. Add the numbers of the gray boxes within each column.
 
 Enter the sum in the box for that option within the line designated Total. 
You wind up with the weighted average for each of the three options. 
This info allows you to compare the forecasted performance based on 
your assumptions.
You can easily see in Figure 4-8 that the most financially beneficial option 
doesn’t maximize the triple bottom line. This weighted-average chart may be 
an uncomfortable model to use, but it should serve as a guide as you transi-
tion to a new and sustainable decision-making framework. The highest score 
is going to yield you the most desirable initiative according to the weight you 
assigned your criteria.
Outlining the details
 
To wind up with the specific initiatives you’re going to proceed with, you need 
to outline the details involved with each option. Sustainability initiatives for 
each prioritized goal need to include the following details:

✓ The significance that the initiative would have in contributing to the 
attainment of the sustainability goal: No need to make this an intricate 
process. Simply state how the initiative contributes to attaining the 
overall goal. The more succinct your statement, the better.
 
✓ An assessment of how complex it will be to implement the initiative: 
Nothing fancy is involved here either. All you really need is a simple bul-
leted list of the steps required to implement the initiative. Your project 
team (the group charged with carrying out the initiative) can then deter-
mine the complexity of the project based on the outlined steps.
 
✓ Which organizational units/business systems need to be involved: 
Use common sense and your business acumen to identify which spe-
cific areas, such as HR, accounting, logistics, or marketing, need to be 
involved in the implementation of the initiative.
 
✓ The internal capacity for implementing the action plan: The most 
important piece of advice I can give you at this juncture is that you 
should make sure a particular person is responsible for spearhead-
ing implementation of each sustainability initiative. Ideally, this point 
person is the lead on the project team charged with overseeing that 
particular initiative. He or she should have a clear timetable, chain of 
command, and budget. Without this accountability, all the green team’s 
planning work can collapse into a heap of good intentions.
 
 You also need to determine whether you’re going to ask outside stake-
holders to participate on the project team to help guide the initiative 
through its implementation phase. Although project teams are typically 

78
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
made up primarily of employees, feel free to invite suppliers, investors, 
community members, and customers to come onboard.
 
✓ A timetable for the initiative: When setting the timetable, you need 
to establish whether there are going to be phases of implementation 
and whether you’re going to measure results at the end of each phase. 
Without a set timetable, your initiative may never get off the ground.
 
✓ A description of how results will be measured: Build a solid assessment 
mechanism into your implementation plan and prepare either a formal 
or informal tool to determine how far you’ve come from your baseline 
assessment. Communicate your project’s efforts far and wide as you go.
 
✓ The budget impact of the initiative: As in any planning endeavor, you 
must attach a budget to everything you do. As you think about resource 
needs, make sure to
 
• Identify which members of the organization would be ideal candidates 
to work on the project team charged with overseeing the initiative.
 
• Include the costs of outside consultants.
 
• Itemize required asset purchases and line out ongoing expenses 
needed to make the initiative fly.
 
• Identify savings that will accrue from reducing waste output, 
energy usage, and anything else associated with this project and 
net that out against the cost of implementing the initiative.
 
• Include a timetable for full implementation of your plan.
 
• Outline the chain of command that exists in your organization to 
apportion these resources.
Prioritizing your initiatives
As you look at different initiatives, compare the complexity of implementa-
tion against the urgency of taking action. Small but strong projects garner 
interest, so attack the easiest and most urgent first.
When you prioritize your initiatives based on complexity and urgency, the 
projects that make their way to the top of the to-do list are those that are 
easiest to implement and address a critical need. If you’re trying to prioritize 
the remaining initiatives in the future, I suggest being patient and seeing how 
implementation of the first set of projects goes because follow-up or phased-
in projects from your to-do list may naturally follow. For example, if you 
determine that conducting a carbon footprint evaluation is a priority goal, 
then projects to decrease emissions will follow.

79
 Chapter 4: Creating Your Sustainability Plan
Spreading the Word about Your Plan
For your sustainability plan to work, you must be prepared to help your 
stakeholders understand why you prioritized your sustainability initiatives 
the way you did. Then you need to offer them a compelling case as to how 
this prioritization is going to strengthen the company, the community, and, 
yes, each person’s individual well-being.
With a workable sustainability action plan, you can communicate to every-
body, in an authentic manner, how you’re positioning your business for 
the future. Showcase your work with local policymakers and media — let 
everyone know, for example, that you’re crafting carbon-neutral commuting 
options. Take advantage of press releases and opinion pieces in the local 
paper to highlight your good work and reach out to the blogging world. See 
whether other businesses are interested in bringing a corporate car-share 
program to town. Who knows — other companies may even contact you to 
get ideas for their programs!
Communicating your green initiatives occurs whenever someone walks into 
your place of business, not just when the media reports on them or when 
they’re described in marketing materials. Therefore, demonstrating a com-
mitment to all of your stakeholders through daily activities goes a long way 
toward making the right impression and creating buy-in. (This approach 
applies to employees, too; I cover bringing them onboard in Chapter 13). 
Communicate the green team’s progress, taking every opportunity to share 
all the ecoevents occurring in your company. Talk about your sustainable 
Making far-fetched ideas seem reasonable
Sometimes a particular sustainability initiative 
seems unrealistic, whether that’s due to its 
exorbitant costs, way-out technology require-
ments, a lack of resources for implementing it, 
or something else. Before you cross that idea 
off the list, try to figure out whether it can be 
presented in a different light.
For example, suppose that one of your initia-
tives is to replace your current distribution fleet 
with hybrid alternatives over the next ten years, 
but a lot of your research shows that current 
trucking logistics is transitioning toward a new 
generation of vehicle, and that hybrid 18-wheel-
ers will be rolling off the assembly lines in 24 
to 36 months. The projected cost of replacing 
your fleet with these new rigs is $2.3 million. Do 
you scrap the idea completely, knowing that the 
cost would prohibit consideration? No, but your 
action plan to meet the goal of “increased fleet 
efficiency” could include a fleet-replacement ini-
tiative that calls for all new purchases to adhere to 
certain internal guidelines for carbon emissions.
If gathering age- and longevity-related data for 
each truck within your fleet is fairly easy, then you 
can propose the approximate time span within 
which this transition would occur, showing that 
over ten years you can be fully converted. Fuel 
savings from each new purchase may fund the 
next replacement and make the initiative look 
more viable to stakeholders or top management.

80
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
product rollout, the number of employees biking to work, or your new green 
advertising firm whenever and wherever you can!
 
If you need to communicate difficult subjects related to your sustainability 
plan, such as rolling out a preferred green supplier program that may require 
significant changes on the part of your existing vendors, couch them in a posi-
tive tone that stresses how going green is part of a long-range strategy. Tell 
folks how your plans to remain economically viable in the changing world are 
a benefit to them and focus on green collaborative potential.
 
Communication is a two-way street, so why not get stakeholders involved? 
Asking your stakeholders, particularly those from the community in which 
your business operates, to serve on a corporate sustainability advisory panel 
is a great way to get input and bring lots of different types of people together.
To ensure that the best practices become policy, make sure to formally follow 
through with your stakeholders. Set out a suggestion box. Engage stake-
holders with sustainability training to make sure everyone’s on the same 
page with the initiatives. Conduct check-ins as the initiative progresses to 
see whether it’s on track. Remember: Creating your plan is only the first step 
in making sure all of your sustainability goals become reality — following up 
on it is the key to success.
Creating project teams to foster collaboration
To build excitement and buy-in potential, pre-
pare a summary chart to reflect your working 
groups’ efforts to see whether any initiatives 
offer coordination potential. For example, every 
working group is probably going to come up with 
ideas for dealing with greenhouse gas emission 
reductions. Do you want to create a project team 
to work on this issue that crosses over cluster-
group boundaries? Figure out your strategy and 
create an easy-to-understand chart that lets 
everyone know his or her responsibilities.
Note: Depending on what venue you need to go 
through to obtain approval for the creation of 
project teams and approved budgets, setting up 
prospective project teams may very well be one 
of your green team’s final roles. Transitioning 
to project teams that oversee the various ele-
ments of the sustainability plan begins with the 
approval of the proposed initiatives.
Remember: Although potential project team mem-
bers were identified by your green team during 
the creation of specific initiatives, you may still 
need input from advisors. Pull up your list of key 
stakeholders whom you may have had conversa-
tions with regarding the outcome of the SWOT 
analysis because these folks may make good 
external advisors as your project teams evolve.
The green team should plan on meeting quarterly 
with the project teams to review how implemen-
tation is functioning, as well as to examine the 
results and suggest modifications accordingly.
In your follow-up meetings, you may modify your 
key performance indicators after finding that 
more appropriate measurements exist for partic-
ular goals. Likewise, you may come up with new 
benchmarks to compare your business against 
after researching other organizations’ work. Keep 
everything dynamic and open to change!

Paying Attention to Public Policy 
and the Regulatory Realm
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the value of understanding the big green-policy picture
▶ Identifying how current and impending policies affect your business
▶ Deciding how to respond to and influence policymakers
S
ustainable business development is a necessary model shift that 
demands operating within the Earth’s sustainable carrying capacity. 
It requires more reliance on regional trade, financial incentives to value 
ecosystem services, greenhouse gas reduction policies, and an emphasis on 
equity in international relationships. The great news is that you can be a part 
of it! And quite honestly, you should, because the fiscal implication of these 
policies hits you where it counts: your wallet. Addressing the scope of acts 
being considered and passed is impossible, but suffice it to say that they’re 
occurring at every level of government and will filter down the supply chain 
to affect every size business enterprise.
The Basics on the Green Movement 
and Public Policy
In order to bring about real change in response to the shifting global business 
model, public policies that guide participation in the green transformation 
are crucial. Many aspects of commercial trade will be affected as a result 
of these policies — taxation structures; free trade agreements; oil, gas, and 
other natural resource leases; and new markets (for carbon and green 
products). Realizing that umbrella solutions must exist under which every 
business and consumer can move ahead to face common challenges, all kinds 
of government agencies, investor groups, businesses, trade associations, and 
individuals are jumping into the policy game.

82
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
In the next few sections, I show you who the main players are, how their 
decisions and actions affect your business, and how you can respond.
Who’s running the show
 
Many sustainability advocates believe that a combination of deep understand-
ing, commitment, and concerted action from four key groups is the only real 
chance for coloring the global environment green. Each of these sectors must 
possess a keen willingness to be part of the change and recognize that it has a 
unique and equally potent role to play:
 
✓ Business: With most of the world’s trade based on a capitalistic system, 
business is clearly a key driver in the transition to a sustainable global 
economy. Private enterprise encourages creativity, innovation, investment, 
and technological improvements. Sustainability adds a new way of 
thinking about all these things and is thus a crucial business model for 
the 21st century.
 
 Currently, capitalism doesn’t integrate the full cost associated with 
production into the actual product. For example, the product prices of 
petroleum refining companies and timber companies reflect only the 
overhead associated with extracting the raw material, not the full cost, 
which includes mitigating climate change. Some economists believe that 
this skews the market, because the product is inappropriately priced.
 
 Thanks to a growing number of various green consumers (you can 
read all about them in Chapter 10), the demand for green product lines, 
service offerings, and business operations is growing. However, if 
businesses choose not to make the effort to meet this demand in favor 
of sticking to the old business model of short-term, purely profit-based 
thinking, the continued decimation of natural resources and the growth 
of global inequity will escalate, causing potentially irreversible damage 
to the planet and the world’s population.
 
✓ Government: The influence of government at all levels is important as a 
unifying force to tip the playing field toward sustainable development. 
Why? Because fiscal policies, such as subsidies, taxes, and credits for 
research and development (R&D), as well as regulatory guidelines, are 
the responsibility of different government entities, and they can have 
intense impact on how businesses operate.
 
 On the micro level, a progressive local city council can spur innovative 
green neighborhood developments, which in turn spawn green builders, 
carpenters, planners, and landscapers. On the macro level, policies that 
move toward climate change mitigation and adaptation may require 
countries to limit carbon emissions or meet waste targets, requiring 
businesses and individuals to adapt quickly.

83
 Chapter 5: Paying Attention to Public Policy and the Regulatory Realm
 
✓ Nonprofits: In many areas of public policy, nonprofits are leading the 
move for shifts toward a more sustainable future. Many nonprofits have 
even become large and powerful financial forces with international 
membership numbering in the tens of thousands.
 
 When these organizations partner with companies, investors, and 
policymakers, their potential to inspire real change is significant. For 
example, the Sierra Club and the Citizens for Tax Justice partnered to 
expose subsidies to industry sectors that left taxpayers with clean-up 
costs, thereby reversing an alarming trend of citizens bailing out 
pollution remediation.
 
✓ Individuals: Of course, instilling values about environmental and social 
stewardship and purchasing power changes at the grassroots level 
are essential for true, widespread change. Particularly pertinent in the 
movement toward a global green economy is the influence of share-
holders, both large and small.
 
 Institutional investors, as well as individuals holding 50 shares of a com-
pany’s stock in an IRA, have started to tap into the power of resolutions 
and activist agendas (see the later section “Targeting your efforts” for 
more on shareholder resolutions). Because of the changes effected by 
these initiatives, individuals are becoming recognized as a force to be 
reckoned with in the movement toward sustainable development.
How the greening of public 
policy affects business
A number of policy mechanisms can urge consumers and producers alike to 
change their behaviors toward sustainability, but what really comes first — 
the change in behaviors or the policies themselves? Opinions diverge when 
discussions dial in on incentivizing versus regulating. Some taxpayers believe 
that incentives, like tax credits and subsidies, encourage innovation without 
mandating particular ways of getting there. Others see newly imposed taxes 
as yet another impediment to maintaining a profit margin adequate to keep 
their businesses solvent.
Regulations such as imposing new taxes on old behaviors (like generat-
ing garbage) probably isn’t the first place government would turn to effect 
change, because of business owners’ natural resistance to new taxes. 
However, new fiscal policies actually institute change at no or low cost to 
businesses. For example, plastic bags used in retail outlets are being elimi-
nated from entire cities, and even countries, by placing a surtax on them. The 
businesses aren’t suffering because they have a new commodity to sell (reus-
able bags) and are completely eliminating the cost of providing plastic bags 
to customers.

84
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
If given enough time, incentive-based tax models are effective in bringing 
about green change in some scenarios. However, regulation often brings about 
immediate (albeit antagonistic) change. Many tax models are bandied about 
in policy circles these days, but a hybrid of the following is likely to yield the 
most efficient path toward sustainable development and innovation:
 
✓ Tax shifting: The premise of tax shifting is simple: Stop taxing positive 
behaviors (like earning income and accruing net worth) and start taxing 
negative behaviors that require society to bear the external costs (like 
generating pollution and waste). Named after economist Arthur Pigou, 
these Pigovian taxes are usually associated with ecotaxes or sin taxes. 
Some economists believe that this type of revenue-neutral tax shifting is 
more immediate and effective than regulation, because it offers continu-
ing incentive to pollute less.
 
✓ Credits and deductions that incentivize solutions: In a divisive arena, 
almost every policymaker agrees that incentives must exist. These 
incentives normally take the form of tax deductions or tax credits, most 
often for practicing energy efficiency and using renewable energy. Tax 
credits are also available in different states for constructing green build-
ings, employing at-risk individuals, and using recycled materials. Some 
jurisdictions are even considering tax breaks for sustainable corpora-
tions that have voluntarily adopted the triple bottom line as part of their 
corporate policies.
 
 The Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (www.
dsireusa.org) features a comprehensive listing of renewable energy 
and energy efficiency income and property tax breaks, by state, for indi-
viduals and companies. Check it out to see what incentives are offered 
where your company is headquartered.
Ways you can respond
Business owners and employees are generally fearful of impending govern-
ment regulations and mandates, because the policymakers possess great 
collective power. But that doesn’t mean you should sit submissively on the 
sidelines — ample opportunities exist to have an equally potent voice at the 
policymaking table. Joining trade associations or green business groups, 
attending local city council meetings, and supporting like-minded politicos 
are all viable avenues for influencing the development of green policies. But 
in order to play ball, you must understand the implications of the macro poli-
cies being discussed in your area and how they may impact the future of a 
particular business or industry sector.
 
Because businesses are uniquely poised to work with the other core groups 
(governments, nonprofits, and individuals) responsible for creating and imple-
menting green policies, you have two options:

85
 Chapter 5: Paying Attention to Public Policy and the Regulatory Realm
 
✓ Position your company to deal with the policies being proposed. You’ll 
be better off in the long term if you pay attention to proposed policies, 
because if a particular regulation is approved, your company won’t have 
to hustle to meet new requirements. In light of carbon-tax discussions, 
for example, you’d want to begin the process of lightening your carbon 
footprint slowly and with purpose instead of responding in a panic when 
new laws are passed.
 
✓ Try to do your best to influence the policies. By being a part of associa-
tions or groups that are working toward specific regulatory changes, 
you can advocate on behalf of policies that will be most beneficial for 
your business.
Every aspect of your business will be affected as sustainability-oriented poli-
cies, laws, and tax changes begin to unfold. I encourage you to be optimistic 
and look to the opportunity-laden side of the coin, regardless of where you 
personally stand on the issue of government regulations.
What Green Policies Focus On 
in the Business World
As you think about how public policies will affect the greening of your busi-
ness practices, I imagine you’re pretty concerned about one or more of the 
following:
 
✓ Corporate and partnership taxation
 
✓ International trade
 
✓ Energy security and renewable energy development
 
✓ Future availability and pricing of water
 
✓ Incentives to develop products or services for the green market
 
✓ Raw material accessibility
 
✓ Waste management models, including new disposal pricing modes
Government is now stepping up to the plate on these and other key issues. 
Because discussions surrounding many of these areas of concern are in the 
infancy stage, you can have a real hand, particularly at the local or state 
level, in crafting policies that have strategic importance for your business.
Policies to spur economic development through green-collar job growth, 
alternative transportation R&D, biofuels, solar and wind manufacturing, and 
other sustainable maneuvers are making their way to the forefront of legis-
lative agendas. The vast number of pending bills range in focus from green

chemistry to high-performing green buildings and the introduction of sustain-
ability into higher-education institutions. You may find that one or more of 
these proposed bills directly affects your small or mid-sized enterprise.
The next several sections offer some insight into what’s been done and 
what’s on the upcoming roster regarding several areas of concern to the 
average business owner.
Natural resources usage
The usage of natural resources is a vast and complex field that will only con-
tinue to grow in importance as timber, water, and ore become more precious. 
No matter what size your organization is or what industry sector it’s in, you 
undoubtedly use water, energy, and other natural resources. Therefore, con-
tinued access to and affordable pricing of these items are crucial to the long-
term survival of your company.
 
If your business depends on any natural resource, you need to follow pending 
regional and federal legislation affecting the material in question. One policy 
model in particular — the shifting of subsidization from oil, chemicals, and 
corporate agriculture to renewable energy and alternative transportation — 
has received a lot of attention.
 
The scope of the policies at hand is too broad to address in this book, but 
you can use an Internet search engine and type in your state’s name and the 
phrase “Department of Natural Resources” to connect to natural resource 
regulations in your state. Because energy law pertains to converting natural 
resources into energy and is such a hot topic, you should also check out the 
breadth of partnerships, programs, pending legislation, and initiatives listed 
by state at the Department of Energy’s state-specific Web site (apps1.eere.
energy.gov/states).
Energy sources
At the most fundamental level, practically all businesses are understandably 
concerned with the pricing, accessibility, volatility, and security of energy. 
Many companies, particularly small ones, operate on a razor-thin margin that’s 
sorely strained with 10 and 20 percent hikes in key budget line items — namely 
utilities and transportation. Of course, raw materials also have increased 
energy costs embedded in them as well.

87
 Chapter 5: Paying Attention to Public Policy and the Regulatory Realm
 
Tremendous controversy surrounds federal- and state-level approaches to 
energy policy, and you need to know what your state’s legislators, governor, 
and public utility commission are discussing. If you belong to a trade associa-
tion, consider encouraging the development of a subcommittee to focus on 
energy policy and crafting a statement of support for the policy that you 
believe will best benefit your business. If your state is trying to deregulate (or 
regulate) energy and you have reason to believe the outcome won’t be in your 
organization’s best interest, show up at public hearings, write letters to your 
local paper and legislators, and do an Internet search for other like-minded 
business owners in your area.
Looking toward the future, green tags may one day be required as part of 
carbon-reduction strategies for business. Green tags, or Renewable Energy 
Certificates, represent one megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewably generated 
electricity. They can be traded, and the owner of the tag may accurately 
claim to have purchased renewable energy. I recommend staying on top of 
the development of green tags to better understand how the implementation 
of this greenhouse gas reduction policy may affect you down the line.
The scoop on minerals and water
If your company depends on minerals, such as 
titanium, or water to turn a profit, here are some 
special policies and initiatives to keep an eye 
out for:
 ✓ Businesses that rely on minerals for 
manufacturing need to follow proposed 
environmental regulations surrounding 
lighter-impact mining techniques, as well 
as how those regulations may impact your 
vendors, future pricing, and raw materi-
als availability. Keeping tabs on the move 
in policy may also be a great impetus for 
your product development team to analyze 
alternative, more sustainable raw materials
that can be used in place of the mineral in 
question. See Chapter 7 for more details 
on greening your approach to product 
development.
 ✓ If water factors into your business needs, 
pay special attention to initiatives being 
considered by the U.S. Center for Strategic 
and International Studies (CSIS). It’s broker-
ing water and exporting it from Canada to 
the U.S. — despite the fact that Canada has 
its own regional shortages. International 
water brokering is going on behind the 
scenes and can have big implications for 
your business’s water needs in the future.

Currently, 25 states have Renewable Portfolio Standards, which require electric 
companies to procure a certain percent of their electricity from renewables 
by a certain year. For example, New York has a 24-percent requirement by the 
year 2013. Electric companies’ compliance with Renewable Portfolio Standards 
is important to you as a business owner because to operate a truly sustainable 
business, you should source your electricity from renewable sources. Also, 
as more electric companies make the switch to renewable sources, your 
business’s energy bills may be positively impacted.
Greenhouse gas emissions
In the U.S., more than 100 pieces of legislation are pending that contain cli-
mate change provisions. The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act pro-
poses cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 
2050, whereas the Climate Stewardship & Innovation Act of 2007 aims to cut 
them by 30 percent from 2000 to 2050. Many other proposals contain less 
sweeping language but still set big reduction goals, particularly considering 
the Earth’s population is continuing to grow. Although these proposals aren’t 
specifically targeting greenhouse gas emission reduction among corpora-
tions, the implications of such legislation should it pass are greatest for the 
business world.
On the proactive side, the U.S. Climate Action Partnership is applying pres-
sure in Washington, D.C., to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize 
the climate. As more big corporations and nonprofits join, this effort will only 
continue. On a more local level, at last count, mayors representing almost 80 
million citizens in 850 cities had signed the Mayors Climate Protection Act, a 
Kyoto Protocol–type treaty aimed at rolling back greenhouse gas emissions 
to 1990 levels. Many cities are also creating Sustainability Director positions 
to lead their local movements. (Chapter 11 explores this burgeoning move-
ment to expand local economies and lessen reliance on products that travel 
thousands of miles, causing tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the process.)
In most parts of the developed world, climate change concerns have already 
resulted in far-reaching sustainability-oriented laws. Europe, Canada, and 
Australia are much more progressive than the U.S., and it looks like it may 
take a while to garner political consensus on how to proceed. The primary 
federal policy tools being explored include cap and trade and carbon taxing, 
both of which are explained in the following sections.
Setting a cap on carbon emissions allowed: Cap and trade
 
Cap and trade is a tool designed to regulate carbon emissions in absolute 
metric tons from any point of emission. There are three general ways to 
approach cap and trade:

89
 Chapter 5: Paying Attention to Public Policy and the Regulatory Realm
 
✓ Allocation of tons of emission: Companies receive a set number of tons, 
and if your company doesn’t use them all, you have a sellable commodity. 
If you need more, you buy them. (The Chicago Climate Exchange can 
broker greenhouse gases for you.)
Renewable energy policies around the U.S.
The potential for job growth and increased 
national security associated with developing 
renewable energy is great and will be an area 
that many smaller businesses will eventually be 
a part of. Your business may find itself purchas-
ing renewable energy in the future (if you don’t 
already) or being one of the many businesses 
that will be a part of the supply chain for these 
rapidly growing industry sectors. If you believe 
that renewable energy is an area that holds sig-
nificant promise for energy security and reliabil-
ity, consider this: The U.S. government allocates 
about $1.5 billion dollars annually for renewable 
energy R&D. This may sound like a big number, 
but consider that ExxonMobil generates that in 
revenues in just one and a half days.
The Energy Independence & Security Act of 
2007 is focused on research in combined heat 
and power (CHP) fuels. It sets national goals, 
in billions of gallons of renewable fuels created 
through 2022, focusing on new technologies like 
advanced biofuels, waste recovery, and cellu-
losic ethanol. Examples of state-level progres-
sive policies that have already been enacted 
include the following:
 ✓ California’s Air Resource Board uses a 
combination of market mechanisms and 
regulations to ensure a 25-percent reduc-
tion in greenhouse gasses by the year 
2020.
 ✓ Georgia launched Conserve Georgia, a mar-
keting campaign aimed at getting residents 
and businesses to conserve water, energy, 
and land.
 ✓ Illinois and New York have laws requiring 
the use of green cleaning supplies within 
public schools.
 ✓ Montana requires plans from all govern-
ment entities as to how they propose to 
reduce energy consumption 20 percent by 
the year 2010.
 ✓ Washington and Maine have product-
stewardship laws that make electronics 
manufacturers responsible for taking back 
equipment at the end of its life.
Because of the magnitude of effort swelling 
up around new technologies, businesses need 
to start considering a shift toward using and 
developing them, thinking out of the box that oil 
won’t always be the only main energy source. 
When it comes to renewable energy, start 
asking questions like, “Where can I buy it?”, 
“How much will it cost?”, and “How effective 
and reliable is it?”
Many individuals and companies purchase 
green power through green tags (described 
in the nearby “Energy sources” section). That 
doesn’t mean the companies are directly get-
ting power from a wind farm, for example, 
but it does mean that they’ve purchased one 
megawatt-hour of renewable energy from 
somewhere. You can accurately claim to be 
using 20 percent green power if you’re buying 
green tags equal to 20 percent of your aver-
age monthly electricity usage. Go to apps3.
eere.energy.gov/greenpower to find 
green tags to purchase in your area.

Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
✓ An auction of units of emissions: A total number of tons of emission is 
calculated, and the government conducts an auction of sorts, where 
corporations bid for the carbon units.
 
✓ Cap and dividend: This approach is the same as the first method, where 
your company gets a set amount of emissions, but you receive a rebate 
if your company doesn’t use its allocated amount.
The positive side of this policy model is that there’s an absolute cap on the 
number of tons of emissions agreed upon by the policymakers. The target 
is widely known and ideally in line with the reductions needed to achieve 
climate neutrality. However, opponents of this policy claim that it provides 
little motivation to be creative about how to reduce emissions below pre-
determined targets. They also argue that most companies that do reduce 
emissions below their targets will sell their unused emissions rather than let 
the share expire, thereby contributing unneeded greenhouse gases into the 
atmosphere.
Taxing for carbon emissions by the ton
 
A carbon tax is an example of a type of pollution tax. Each emitted ton of 
carbon (and other greenhouse gases) is taxed in an effort to encourage com-
panies to reduce the amounts they emit. Some people believe these taxes 
could be most easily sold as an income tax rebate: Collect carbon taxes and 
then rebate them to taxpayers.
Proponents of the carbon tax point to the success of other pollution taxes 
in altering behavior. Naysayers, however, state that carbon taxes give 
corporations and individuals the right to pollute as long as they can afford it. 
Furthermore, many policymakers are justifiably nervous about the longevity of 
their careers when they utter the dread t-word, particularly in an election year.
One current example of a carbon tax is in British Columbia, where residents 
now pay a $10-per-ton tax on carbon-based fuels. This tax is applied to gaso-
line, diesel, natural gas, and home-heating fuel and is anticipated to increase 
$5 a ton per year until reaching a cap of $30 a ton in 2012. The government 
claims that income tax offsets for businesses and individuals make this a 
revenue-neutral policy. Yet this law is still new and will need to be analyzed 
in subsequent years to gauge its effectiveness in cutting net emissions.
Waste generation
Green policies regarding the generation of waste are currently all across the 
board. Thousands of “paying as you throw” (PAYT) programs are scattered 
across urban and rural North America. PAYT is a trash tax, meaning the more 
solid waste you generate, the more you pay. A full 25 percent of all communi-
ties nationwide have a PAYT system that converts trash disposal from a right 
to a fee-based service.

91
 Chapter 5: Paying Attention to Public Policy and the Regulatory Realm
I personally like the approach used in East Hampton, New York: There is no 
trash service. Each resident and business owner must sort and prepare his 
or her recycling and trash and then haul it to the recycling center or dump as 
appropriate. Can you imagine how resourceful you’d become at eliminating 
trash if you had to personally handle it through its end of life?
In an industry-specific bend, Europe has recently passed legislation requiring 
electronics manufacturers to take responsibility for what happens to their 
products at the end of life. Because these items, called e-waste, contain heavy 
metals, e-waste is an arena that U.S. states are also regulating because of 
the potential groundwater leaching and hazardous material issues. (Turn to 
Chapter 6 for tips on disposing of your business’s e-waste.)
Corporate social responsibility
Corporate social responsibility issues such as human rights violations, cli-
mate change, and executive compensation pepper the topics that spring 
up repeatedly in shareholder resolution filings. The Interfaith Center on 
Corporate Responsibility is a leader in this area. You can see the green focus 
of the topics that topped its most recent agenda by going to www.iccr.org 
and clicking the Shareholder Resolutions tab at the top of the page.
 
In terms of taxes, tax credits and other incentives aimed at growing the green 
economic sector will likely be passed in greater numbers in the future. So keep 
your eye on this area if your business is involved, currently or prospectively, 
with growth in wind or solar power, aquaculture, alternative transportation, 
or local food and/or landscaping so you can reap some well-deserved benefits 
for your greening efforts.
Greenhouse gas reduction initiatives in practice
Specific initiatives designed to reduce the 
amount of greenhouse gases being emitted 
include the following:
 ✓ Boulder, Colorado has a Green Points & 
Green Building ordinance that triggers 
changes in how residential building permits 
are granted based on energy efficiency 
and recycled-content usage, among other 
techniques.
 ✓ Chicago, Illinois is committed to using 20 
percent renewable energy by 2010.
 ✓ Leaf Rapid, Manitoba no longer allows 
nonbiodegradable bags.
 ✓ Vancouver, British Columbia’s recycling 
program recognizes that society bears 
the burden of cleanup and that the manu-
facturer should be the one to develop and 
submit a plan to manage certain products 
(like solvents, pesticides, paint, tires, and 
others) through their end of life. The incen-
tive is now on the producer to use less 
harmful materials and to make them easy 
to remediate.

92
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
Additionally, economic think tanks and university studies alike have been 
claiming that North America will see significant growth in green-collar jobs 
in the upcoming decade. With any luck, these new jobs will provide employ-
ment for the myriad of people who’ve lost their jobs due to downsizing or 
outsourcing.
In 2007, the first federal piece of legislation targeting green-collar jobs was 
passed. The Green Jobs Act was included as part of a comprehensive energy 
bill; it’s geared toward providing job training in renewable energy, flexible 
vehicles, and green construction. About 20 percent of the funds are ear-
marked for hard-to-hire folks like former prisoners, welfare recipients, and 
high-risk youth.
Cities and states are coming onboard as they begin to understand the oppor-
tunity inherent in developing this new economic niche. Oakland, California’s 
Green Jobs Corps and the Richmond, Virginia job training program are both 
being heralded as innovative programs to develop at-risk citizens into employ-
able green-collar workers. Additionally, Iowa has passed job-training bonds for 
biofuel job creation, and Oregon is focusing on training wind technicians.
How and Where to Make 
Your Voice Heard
In many ways, grassroots movements have shown a high degree of success in 
bringing about meaningful change. A classic example is the coalition of moth-
ers in Niagra Falls, New York who banded together to hold a company liable 
for its negligent handling of toxic waste. The result of their union was the 
passage of the Superfund Act, which requires polluters to pay for the cleanup 
of toxic materials.
More so now than ever before, ecodriven grassroots movements are crop-
ping up and influencing change for global benefit. Whether you’re working 
individually or joining up with your local trade association, professional affili-
ate, or other small or mid-sized enterprises in your area, consider working to 
effect change in any of the following ways:
 
✓ Reward innovation in energy efficiency and renewable technologies.
 
✓ Implement policies to reduce solid waste and appropriately recycle 
e-waste.
 
✓ Pass a carbon policy to decrease future market risk surrounding this 
issue.
 
✓ Stop water brokering and encourage regional solutions to water 
problems.

93
 Chapter 5: Paying Attention to Public Policy and the Regulatory Realm
 
✓ Incentivize the use of high-recycled content materials.
 
✓ Encourage innovative product design and certification.
 
✓ Require municipal and state government agencies to impose green 
procurement policies, decrease energy usage, and add sustainability 
training for all employees.
In the following sections, I help you find like-minded businesspeople to join 
forces with and show you how to take part in pressuring policymakers for 
green change that benefits you. I also outline the changes being made in 
green public policy through the involvement of various levels of government 
and influential stakeholders.
Joining with like-minded businesspeople
Businesses gain power when they join together with other businesses that 
have similar values and goals. Perhaps that’s why a number of organizations 
proactively working on the greening of business (as opposed to waiting for 
lawmakers to step up to the plate) are out there just waiting for you to join:
 
✓ Professional or trade associations: My guess is that no matter what 
industry sector you’re in, your professional or trade association is 
working on something green. For example, as fisheries declined signifi-
cantly in the late 1990s, large fish product purchasers got together with 
the Marine Stewardship Council to design programs to certify that fish 
were harvested using sustainable methods. The companies involved 
not only crafted policy (instead of waiting for government regulations) 
but also began the critical steps necessary to preserve their long-term 
raw material source.
 
 If you’re not sure what kind of green projects your professional or 
trade association is up to, run a search within the group’s Web site. If 
you’re the chief partner in a law firm, you may be surprised to know 
that the American Bar Association has a Climate Change, Sustainable 
Development, and Ecosystems Committee that’s in the process of craft-
ing a model sustainability policy/implementation guide.
 
✓ Sustainable business organizations: Although a significant number 
of organizations are working to help businesses develop sustainably, 
here’s a smattering of ones that can offer you a place to craft policy with 
other like-minded businesses:
 
• Social Venture Network: With a mission statement of “Transforming 
the way the world does business,” the Social Venture Network is one 
of the grandfathers of the sustainable business movement. Its Web 
site (www.svn.org) has a searchable database of case studies and 
best practices, as well as an action page that can get you hooked up 
with other members to achieve carbon neutrality. The group also 
holds annual conferences that are great networking opportunities.

94
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
• U.S. Business Council for Sustainable Development: This heavy-
hitting organization has five policy platforms — energy, water, 
byproduct synergy, value chain, and ecosystem services. You can 
get involved in the issue that’s important to your company by visit-
ing www.usbcsd.org.
 
• Net Impact: This group is focused on joining business leaders 
together to solve day-to-day sustainability challenges at the office 
and to effect change at higher-education institutions. Net Impact is 
a good fit for small and mid-sized enterprises. Visit www.net
impact.org to take a look at its focus initiatives.
Pressuring policymakers for change
 
Whenever a comprehensive carbon-reduction policy is negotiated by the 
federal government, companies that haven’t been proactive in at least antici-
pating the effects of these policies will be left in the proverbial dust. Don’t let 
your company meet this fate. Instead, make a stand for your business by pres-
suring lawmakers at all levels to institute the policies that work for both your 
company and the environment.
Following are two organizations that are working with lawmakers to stimulate 
change:
 
✓ ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability: This global organization 
helps local governments develop sustainably (check out www.iclei-
usa.org/about-iclei to find out more). Getting involved as a key 
player in this group by providing input on discussions and proposing 
funding initiatives can be a very positive move for your company as 
you go green. After all, only you know which of the various legislative 
concerns are most important for your business. Whatever they may be, 
you can bet that any potential changes may affect your bottom line. So 
why not try to have a hand in helping local lawmakers craft policy rather 
than simply reacting to it?
 
✓ Investor Network on Climate Risk: Considered a rather influential 
group, INCR represents some of the biggest institutional investors in the 
U.S. Managing more than $6.5 billion in assets, INCR calls on legislators 
to fulfill three specific tasks in response to climate change:
 
• Reduce regulatory uncertainty. Everyone knows that carbon will 
be regulated one day, but INCR thinks that the markets are bearing 
the uncertainty of what that’s going to look like. After policymak-
ers firmly commit to a set reduction and establish a system to 
promote reduction, business entities will respond and markets will 
adjust accordingly.

95
 Chapter 5: Paying Attention to Public Policy and the Regulatory Realm
 
• Reward solutions. INCR wants legislators to propose a comprehen-
sive bill that would provide incentives to companies implementing 
innovative ideas.
 
• Minimize risk. As other developed countries are changing their 
business modalities to reduce carbon, INCR believes the U.S. is 
becoming more exposed to future economic risk due to its lack of a 
cohesive policy.
Targeting your efforts
Where you invest your persuasive efforts is wholly dependent on what busi-
ness you’re in. In the following list, I outline ways the various levels of gov-
ernment and other influential folks are generally getting involved in the world 
of sustainability. Consult your state or province’s congressional Web site to 
see a list of pending legislation. If you’re really committed, call or e-mail your 
representative or senator directly to obtain a specific list of green legislation 
you can use to help determine where your energies are best directed.
 
✓ Federal government: The U.S. and Canadian governments officially rec-
ognize climate change and stable energy as prevailing national security 
and economic issues. Accordingly, hundreds of pieces of legislation are 
pending in both Congress and Parliament.
 
 The easiest place to follow federal legislative activity in the U.S. is to 
go to thomas.loc.gov and key in “green” or “sustainable.” To track 
Canada’s federal, provincial, and territorial legislative status on sustain-
ability-oriented issues, join EcoLog Environmental Resources Group at 
www.ecolog.com/sustainability.
 
✓ State government: Many states are aggressively pursuing the transition 
to sustainability, whereas others are doing little. Sustainable purchas-
ing policies and energy efficiency are areas of interest for many state 
agencies that are going green, but specific policies really tend to run the 
gamut.
 
 A comprehensive list of states working on greening efforts isn’t available, 
so plug in the name of your state and “sustainable” or “green” into an 
Internet search engine to see what’s going on in your neck of the woods.
 
 Don’t forget about powerful state coalitions working on a host of issues. 
The Western Governors Association, for example, is committed to sound 
water, energy, and climate change policies; the Northeast Governors 
are looking to increase rail capacity as a cornerstone of sustainable 
development.

96
Part I: Sustainability: The Visionary Way to Grow a Business 
 
✓ City councils and such: Even cities are jumping on the green band-
wagon. Across North America, mayoral leadership is generating busi-
ness and community support for policies that encourage sustainable 
economies and cut greenhouse gas emissions. With environmentally 
preferable purchasing policies arising from many of these efforts, look 
for increased opportunities for your green business to serve government 
agencies.
 
✓ Shareholders: Although shareholder resolutions have showed up on 
dockets for almost 40 years, the scope and intensity with which they’re 
shaping sustainable corporate policy agendas of late is truly amazing. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allows any stockholder 
who holds at least $2,000 in stock for a minimum of one year to file a 
shareholder resolution. (Obviously, however, there’s more impact if 
individuals collaborate.) Most resolutions are generally filed in order 
to raise public awareness and effect change in environmental or human 
rights practices.
 
 Even though many resolutions fail, and often the ones that pass aren’t 
generally binding, they bring a lot of attention, sometimes adversely, 
to the company. Fortunately, after management grasps the inherent 
marketing and image-enhancement value in making some of the changes 
contained in the resolution, the triple-bottom-line impact of shareholder 
resolutions can shine through. For example, a major computer/electron-
ics firm committed to removing all persistent toxic chemicals from its 
product line as the result of a shareholder resolution suit. This decision 
resulted in a plethora of free press spotlighting the company’s progres-
siveness compared to its competitors and a reduction in the company’s 
need for expensive hazardous material disposal.
 
 Shareholder resolutions and proxies may not directly impact your busi-
ness, but as sustainability increasingly becomes the business model for 
larger corporations, the trickle-down effect is inevitable. Sometime soon, 
your key customers will be asking for your sustainability plan or award-
ing points to your bid based on green agenda items.
 
 Though these scenarios typically occur for companies that are publicly 
held, overall community awareness is growing, creating new opportuni-
ties for your small or mid-sized enterprise to do sustainable business 
with the big guys. Identify which of your value chain members are going 
green and see how you can serve their needs.

Pushing Up Your 
Green Sleeves: 
Implementation

In this part . . .
T
 he most effective way to green a business is to look 
at the big picture and then roll up your sleeves and 
craft small, achievable goals for each functional area. 
That’s why this part takes you through the basics of 
greening some of your business’s most integral functional 
areas, starting with your daily office practices. From offer-
ing tips on handling e-waste to showing employees how 
altering paper margins can result in reduced paper waste, 
here I clue you in to the many opportunities for high-
impact, low-cost initiatives you can undertake to incre-
mentally effect big change.
Engaging in sustainable product development, which is 
geared toward modifying design strategies to encompass 
new thinking, is another way you can institute sustainabil-
ity at your company. Eking more out of natural resources, 
reducing waste, and minimizing energy and materials 
usage are all core values of green design. Facilities man-
agement and accounting practices are some of the other 
key organizational areas in which you can effect eco-
change, perhaps by implementing some of the suggestions 
I offer in the following pages.

Chapter 6
Small Steps, Big Change: 
Office Practices
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know the basics of greening your office practices
▶ Conserving electricity at your office
▶ Cutting down on office waste
▶ Giving your purchasing policies on office supplies an ecofriendly face-lift
▶ Trimming the carbon impact of office travel
L
ooking at your daily routines, as incorporated in office policies and 
procedures, is often a visible and tangible way to begin the transition to 
a green business model. Greening your office practices deepens employee 
knowledge, saves you money, and serves as an integral part of overall com-
pany ecoimprovements. As is true in all comprehensive cultural shifts, small 
daily behavior modifications add up to sweeping changes and potentially 
big cost savings. In this chapter, I introduce you to the breadth of the most 
common changes in the office practices arena and show you how to imple-
ment these changes while getting your colleagues onboard.
Greening Office Practices: What You 
Can Do and Why You Should Do It
Sustainability efforts in the office usually center on key areas such as energy 
efficiency, waste reduction, purchasing practices, and company travel 
policies. Most action items in the office arena, as well as organizational 
areas, have multiple layers of positive impact. For example, engaging in a 
paper-reduction policy saves energy and reduces waste. Establishing new 
procurement parameters for office equipment enhances energy efficiency 
and contributes to easier recycling of electronic waste, or e-waste. Moving 
to nontoxic office cleaners improves indoor air quality and provides a more 
healthful work environment for your employees.

Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
If you want to take sustainable steps in other areas of your operation, then 
you absolutely need to make some basic green changes in your daily office 
practices. After all, how can you expect stakeholders to get onboard with pro-
gressive changes like sustainable product design if you don’t recycle or prac-
tice temperature control in the office? By making the commitment to green 
your internal practices as well as those that affect external stakeholders, 
you’re letting all stakeholders know that sustainability is here to stay at your 
company.
Because most employees (unless they’re at a remote site) will be engaged in 
some way with office greening efforts, this is a great way to bring everyone 
onboard and introduce the opportunities inherent in practicing green behav-
iors in the workplace. Not only can you secure staff’s buy-in but you can also 
begin looking for those ecominded individuals who might be good candidates 
for furthering green change throughout your organization. (For help spotting 
the characteristics of a sustainable thinker, see Chapter 3.)
Where to Begin? Getting 
the Lay of the Land
Projecting triple-bottom-line benefits from individual initiatives may help 
guide you in what to do first. However, prioritization in office sustainability 
efforts is based on the location and culture of your organization, the nature 
of your operations, and the structure under which you operate. Prices for 
energy vary greatly among different geographic areas. For example, some 
company cultures might easily embrace a change to corporate travel policy, 
whereas others might be very resistant. You have to be able to decide in 
which areas change will be the most visible and the most well received.
With all that said, however, most companies begin greening their office prac-
tices by promoting energy conservation. Because of the tremendous amount 
of personal and commercial concern as to energy prices and volatility — as 
well as the immediate impact on utility bills — improving energy efficiency 
through tactics like lightening up on your lighting usage and greening your 
IT department is an easy way to start greening your office practices. Picking 
the low-hanging fruit by introducing energy-usage-reduction projects is often 
a way to showcase immediate economic savings. These great starter projects 
allow opportunities for outreach to employees and help bring them onboard 
with the green movement. Many times, energy-reduction projects generate 
additional cash from utility savings, and those funds can provide seed capital 
for further work.

 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
Simplifying sustainability initiatives in the office environment is the key to 
successfully implementing change in your office practices. You can’t over-
whelm your employees with a big long list of mandates (If you do, you’ll likely 
be managing a small-scale revolt rather than generating interest in greening 
your office.) The best approach is to ease people into working sustainably by 
making the changes small, easy, and rewarding. Then, as you introduce the 
more complex or high-barrier ideas, your team will (theoretically, at least) be 
less resistant and on track with the bigger picture.
 
Here are my recommendations on what to do when you’re first starting to 
green your daily office practices:
 
✓ Ensure that the cost-benefit analysis makes sense (for example, in some 
rural areas, recycling glass isn’t environmentally sound because a solid 
reuse market doesn’t exist).
 
✓ Find easy-to-implement practices first.
 
✓ Be able to show a cost savings from early efforts.
 
✓ Don’t require tons of behavior changes early on.
 
Ultimately, increasing office sustainability benefits the triple bottom line 
(people, planet, and profit; see Chapter 1 for more on the triple bottom line). 
Be prepared, however, to justify initial outlays of capital for some of these 
projects, realizing that savings generated over the long term will more than 
amply provide for your original upfront expenditure. Depending on how 
resource allocation works in your company (which is highly dependent on 
your organization’s size and corporate structure), you may be running expen-
diture requests through your direct superior, the finance director, or execu-
tive management.
Increasing Energy Efficiency
These days, you can’t enter a room without spotting at least one electrical 
outlet on a wall. What you don’t see is that a majority of those outlets are 
powered by coal plants that emit a disturbing amount of carbon dioxide, 
which is a major contributor to climate change. Good energy management 
is good business. Depending on your industry sector, energy costs, and 
geographic location, utility bills can be a significant line item on your Profit 
& Loss Statement. Even a small percentage reduction can have big dollar 
impact.

102
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Consequently, it’s not surprising that reducing energy usage is on the global 
business population’s mind lately. You can take steps toward decreasing 
your business’s greenhouse gas emissions (and its resulting effect on climate 
change) and increasing your cash flow by setting up a well-crafted, long-term 
energy conservation plan for your office that focuses on eventually becoming 
carbon neutral. To achieve this status, you need to develop a three-pronged 
approach:
 
✓ Practice energy conservation. This term refers to becoming more effi-
cient with the energy you currently use. Depending on how efficient 
your facilities and operations have been in the past, aggressive energy 
management efforts can, in certain parts of the country, yield up to 30 
percent savings, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
 
✓ Convert all or a part of your usage to renewable energy sources. 
However aggressive your energy-conservation initiatives may be, you’ll 
still have some energy needs. Because of the uncertainty surrounding 
carbon taxes and restrictions in the future (see Chapter 5 for more on 
pending policy discussions), all businesses need to be thinking about 
ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Position yourself for the 
future by turning to renewable energy sources as much as possible. (See 
Chapter 8 for the scoop on renewable energy sources.) Most parts of 
the U.S. have some renewable energy that can be purchased, with prices 
varying widely depending on your geographic location. Although renew-
able energy may cost you more now, you’re beginning the process of 
weaning your company off of oil and coal, which sets you up for stability 
in the future.
 
✓ Offset any traditional energy that you can’t convert to renewables. 
This step, known as carbon offsetting, refers to purchasing an instrument 
to absorb any carbon you continue to emit, despite your efficiency and 
conservation efforts.
 
Why not plan for the future while you’re at it? Make sure to expressly request 
that any savings generated by increased energy efficiency at your office be 
allocated to future sustainability efforts, which may require more seed capital 
than the easy and obvious projects described in the following sections.
Finding out the amount of 
energy you currently use
To practice energy efficiency effectively, you first need to get a handle on the 
amount of energy you currently use. You may think this amount is fairly 
obvious, but I’m going to let you in on the dirty little secret about office 
energy: Most of those machines plugged into your walls are sucking power 
even when they aren’t in use.

103
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
The best way to start gauging your current energy usage is to gather a rudi-
mentary baseline assessment. Using the last 12 to 24 months of energy bills, 
enter your kilowatt usage and total electricity cost per month on a simple 
spreadsheet. Doing so gives you an idea what your utility usage patterns are 
and provides you with a jumping-off point as you begin to implement ideas 
from the next few sections.
Traditional 8-to-5 companies use the most electricity when rates are at their 
highest. This is called your peak amount. If you’re charged a demand rate 
on your electric bill, you pay a fee based on your peak amount of electricity 
consumption. Lowering your peak rate of usage can save you some big-time 
cash. Note: Peak times are unique to certain parts of the country, so you may 
not have to deal with this issue at all.
 
When you pull your utility bill, look for surcharges or demand rate add-ons. 
Call your utility company to clarify if you don’t understand certain charges.
As you plan your energy-conservation measures, make sure to keep a keen 
eye out for any energy-sucking operations or tasks that could be repositioned 
at another time of day. When you look at your next 12 months of energy bills 
after implementing some of these simple measures (with all other variables 
being equal, of course), you should see a decrease in kilowatt usage com-
pared to the same month in the prior year.
 
For extra impact, use a carbon calculator to convert kilowatts to tons of 
carbon emitted per month. The resulting number will serve as the basis for 
assessing the success of your energy-reduction efforts. A great carbon calcula-
tor to use is currently available at www.safeclimate.net/calculator/
biz_calc_form1.php. The best one isn’t up and running yet as of this writ-
ing, but keep checking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Web 
site (www.epa.gov) and searching for its Office Carbon Footprint Calculator.
Your baseline assessment of office energy usage gives you glimpses of the 
canvas, but by no means does it paint the full picture of your organizational 
impact on climate change. To comprehensively catalog your business’s 
greenhouse gas emissions, a full inventory is your next step. Inventorying 
greenhouse gases is a fairly time-consuming and complex task, and goes 
much further than baseline energy assessments.
Conducting a full inventory of your company’s greenhouse gas emissions is 
generally only desirable for small to mid-sized businesses if
 
✓ You’re really serious about significantly reducing your business’s envi-
ronmental impact and you want to establish a baseline assessment 
because you intend to expand your market into areas or niches that will 
make purchasing choices based on your efforts. (See Chapter 10 for a 
run-down on the various types of green consumers who might base their 
purchasing decisions on your initiatives.)

104
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ A key customer has asked for it as part of greening its supply chain.
 
✓ You’re anxious to market your greening efforts and want to share data 
with stakeholders as to your overall greenhouse gas reduction goals and 
accomplishments.
 
The big six greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Reduction 
targets are outlined in the Kyoto Protocol, a global greenhouse gas reduction 
treaty signed by more than 180 countries since 1997. It voluntarily calls on 
signatory countries to reduce their greenhouse gas levels to at or below 1990 
emissions.
 
Most power companies are willing to conduct a once-in-a-lifetime free energy 
audit of each building that they service in their area. I recommend finding out 
whether yours does and getting on its waiting list now. If your power company 
doesn’t offer this service, a private company in your area may be willing to 
perform this function for a fee. However, there’s no reason to do both: Use the 
free audit if you can and turn to the fee-for-service option if you must.
A professional audit should include an evaluation of your utility bills and 
current energy-conservation methods via interviews and observation. It 
should also include an analysis conducted with specialized equipment such 
as blower doors (which measure air leaks in the building envelope) and pos-
sibly infrared cameras that can identify hard-to-spot air pockets or missing 
insulation. The output should be an analysis that identifies specific projects, 
including cost estimates and related energy savings.
After the audit is complete, you’ll receive a report (each report differs based 
on the unique company that issues it) that offers some energy-saving tips and 
gives suggestions as to how you can
 
✓ Increase the efficiency of the energy-consuming systems you have in place
 
✓ Conserve energy by sealing external air leaks, adding insulation, and 
implementing weatherization measures
 
✓ Purchase green power to offset the traditional energy you use
Starting with the low-hanging fruit
Prioritize the energy-conservation ideas that seem easiest and least costly 
to implement and get going on ’em. These low-hanging fruits are an easy sell 
to the higher-ups and provide tangible and immediate savings in the form of 
reduced utility bills. They also have impact on employees. Some of the 
projects mentioned in this section involve minor disruptions; others may 
constitute (in certain individuals’ minds) sincere sacrifice.

105
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
 
Because all fundamental shifts come with some amount of sacrifice, make sure 
your employees see that the burden is spread equitably among all levels of 
employees. Model efficiency in all that you do and spearhead the communica-
tion effort, continually emphasizing how important it is that your company 
takes responsibility for its own energy future. Acknowledge that some of the 
changes may be frustrating at first, but will soon become routine.
Following are some examples of simple tasks you can do that require minimal 
time and effort:
 
✓ Install “smart strip” power strips. These savvy little energy-saving 
power strips work between your main device (such as your PC) and the 
main outlet. All of your PC’s peripherals (like scanner, fax, printer, and 
PDA) plug into the other receptacles of the “smart strip.” When the main 
device is off, all other energy flow is stopped, saving up to 75 percent 
of the previously wasted energy. Although relatively new to the market, 
bloggers and marketers alike are saying that these $30 to $40 gadgets 
can pay for themselves in just six short weeks.
Counting your company’s carbon emissions with 
the GHG Protocol
Ten years ago, the World Resources Institute 
joined forces with the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development to create the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) as a 
way to help government and business leaders 
comprehend, measure, and manage green-
house gas emissions. After scads of industry 
input, the GHG Protocol working group has 
released a user-friendly tool that’s both non-
technical and consistent with proposals by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) for greenhouse gas emission invento-
rying. It provides greenhouse gas standards, 
including some industry-specific calculation 
tools.
You can check out the wide array of good 
calculation tools by registering (a simple and 
free two-minute process) and then accessing 
the information at this Web site: www.ghg
protocol.org/calculation-tools. 
Unlike the many Web sites out there that claim 
to be carbon calculators for businesses but 
are actually sales tools for carbon offsets, the 
calculators published by the GHG Protocol are 
the real deal.
What’s neat about the tools is that you can 
calculate one facet of your company at a time, 
if that’s the approach you’ve designated. For 
example, if you’ve identified business travel 
as an area of concern, there’s a calculator to 
help you understand your company’s impact 
from that activity. The same goes for employee 
commuting or purchased electricity.
The GHG Protocol also has a great resource for 
small, office-based organizations that includes 
spreadsheets and guidance. You can find it 
here: www.ghgprotocol.org/down
loads/calcs/working9-5.pdf.

Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Turn off lights in unused spaces, including restrooms, breakrooms, 
and boardrooms. This idea sounds pretty basic, but make a mental note 
in your daily life to flip lights off as you exit a room. You’ll start to notice 
how many uninhabited spaces are lit. Ridiculous, huh? The amount of 
energy and cash you can save by keeping uninhabited spaces unlit is 
worth adding this task to your routine.
 
✓ Impose a policy of turning all computers and lights off at night. Even 
though most new computers have sleep or hibernate modes, the offi-
cials who provide Energy Star ratings (see the later section “Replacing 
old equipment with green alternatives” for more on Energy Star certi-
fication) still assert that turning off your computer at night maximizes 
energy savings. Even in sleep mode, a computer uses about 3 watts per 
hour, so shut it off completely on weekends and at night. Assign a differ-
ent person each week (or month) to make sure all computers and lights 
are turned off at night until the practice becomes a habit for everyone. 
You can certainly mandate that all PCs and desktops be turned off even 
though servers may need to be on for backup purposes.
 
✓ Moderate the thermostats by a few degrees. Optimal temperature in 
your office depends, of course, on what part of the country you operate 
in. However, the suggested “responsible” indoor temperatures for com-
mercial and residential facilities are 64 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter 
and 78 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. Energy savings can be dra-
matic for even a one or two degree shift in average indoor temperature. 
Make sure to let staff know that tweaking the temp is an integral part of 
your business’s overall energy-efficiency efforts. They’ll figure out how 
to dress appropriately pretty quickly.
 
Always be sure to evaluate the impact implementing an energy-efficiency 
idea will have on your organization as a whole — including your employees. 
Potential problems arise when the response to a new temperature policy 
yields a rash of under-the-desk space heaters. Depending on the type of per-
sonal space heater, these devices can suck more energy than you’re saving 
with a facility-wide temperature reduction. Policing the office for violations 
gets awkward, so save yourself the potential frustration and definite expenses 
by consistently directing green messaging toward your employees.
 
To make the green sell easier to your staff, show them the summarized results 
of your baseline energy audit (described in the preceding section) and track 
the progress you’re making together toward reducing monthly kilowatt usage 
on a chart in the breakroom or in the monthly newsletter. People tend to feel 
great when they can see the results of their efforts. Tie the reduced energy 
usage into cost savings and reiterate that your company is positioning itself 
for the future by becoming less reliant on volatile energy. Take some of the 
savings and host a quarterly get-together to celebrate your group efforts. In 
any event, continually reinforce that together, as a group, you’re making your 
company stronger by your efforts.

107
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
Lightening up on your lighting
Looking at the lighting in your office space as a platform for increasing sus-
tainability can yield some real triple-bottom-line results. In an average office 
building, lighting can consume up to 50 percent of total energy used. The 
impact, therefore, of conserving energy through lighting retrofits can be quite 
significant. Also, increased worker productivity due to decreased eye strain 
from natural lighting (a key component of sustainable lighting) is another 
key benefit. The triple-bottom-line impact is rounded out by reduced carbon 
emissions from more efficient lighting.
If the idea of sustainable lighting increasing worker productivity seems a bit 
hard to swallow, consider that when furniture company Herman Miller built 
its new LEED-certified furniture plant in Zeeland, Michigan, the lighting (fea-
turing daylighting and state-of-the-art sustainable lighting) was widely given 
credit for increased employee productivity in the ensuing year. Although 
productivity can be difficult to measure accurately, one statistic stands tall: 
More than 50 percent of the employees had perfect attendance records in the 
subsequent year. With the combined productivity increase and cost savings 
from a green building, the facility paid for itself within the first year of opera-
tions. At $525 per square foot, that wasn’t a small feat!
 
Not up for a major office overhaul at this point? Don’t worry. The easiest way 
to lessen energy expended by lighting, without major retrofitting, is to encour-
age habit-changing behaviors in everyone down the corridor. Lowering watt-
age and reducing the amount of time lights are actually on are the two most 
effective energy-reduction techniques that can be made, according to the 
American Lighting Association.
Check out the following list to get some additional ideas of minor lighting 
conversions that pack a big energy-savings punch:
 
✓ Replacing incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent light 
bulbs (CFLs): This advice may sound trite, but changing out your old 
incandescents for CFLs immediately reduces your expended lighting 
energy by 50 to 80 percent. Additionally, a single 18-watt CFL (replacing 
a 75-watt incandescent) generates a $45 lifetime savings (assuming an 
8-cent-per-killowatt-hour energy cost). When multiplied by the number 
of standard bulbs in your company, my guess is that savings tallies to a 
significant number.
 
✓ Adding dimmers, motion sensors, or automatic shut-offs on existing 
lights: Don’t feel like relying on yourself or your staff to turn off lights? 
Hand the task over to technology! These lighting controls don’t increase 
the energy required to operate the unit, but (depending on the specifics 
of what you install) they can reduce the amount of time any given light 
is on, thereby increasing efficiency.

108
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Converting desk lamps to cutting-edge LED lamps: This new lighting 
technology, which relies on light-emitting diodes, is even more highly effi-
cient than compact fluorescents. It’s also coming down in price and wid-
ening in availability. In the old days, LEDs were only used as indicator 
lights. However, as the materials used in LEDs have grown more sophis-
ticated, LEDs have become bright enough to be used for illumination in 
lamps and other lighting fixtures.
 
✓ Decreasing lighting used in overlit areas: Simply switching from four-
lamp fixtures to three- or even two-lamp fixtures can reduce both energy 
inefficiencies and their associated costs.
Selecting the most efficient lighting for your office requires balancing a 
complicated stew of ingredients, which include lamp ballast platform per-
formance (as measured in lumens per watt), color-rendering indices, task 
assessment, lamp life, and, oh yeah — cost!
Ousting old office equipment
It’s fairly common knowledge that commercial buildings contribute signifi-
cantly to carbon dioxide emissions in North America. What you may not 
realize is that the office equipment within them represents the third largest 
energy draw within these structures, after lighting and heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Additionally, if the building isn’t vented 
properly, the heat all this equipment produces ramps up the structure’s air 
conditioning requirements significantly.
What office isn’t virtually humming with PCs, servers, printers, and peripher-
als? Office equipment is an area of tremendous energy drain with big cost 
implications. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy states 
that the daily workhorses in society’s offices directly consume 7 percent of 
total commercial electric energy, which translates to an astounding $1.8 bil-
lion in electricity costs to businesses annually.
The Energy Star labeling program has identified the following pieces of equip-
ment as high-priority items: computers, monitors, printers, fax machines, 
copiers, scanners, and multifunction devices. Identifying which exact piece in 
your office is ripe for replacement is completely dependent on the age, make, 
and usage of that item. Copiers use more energy per unit that any other piece 
of office equipment, so set it to sleep mode, if you have that option, when you 
close the office for the day.
In the next two sections, I help you figure out how to turn your energy-guzzling 
office equipment into active components of your overall sustainability plan.

109
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
Making a list of life-expectancy expiration dates
If you have an idea of when computers, faxes, copy machines, and the like 
may be on their way out the door, you can more easily construct a green 
replacement strategy, which is then reflected in your new purchasing policies.
Start by pulling an inventory of your office equipment as it stands today. 
The easiest way to acquire this info is probably by grabbing it from the 
depreciation schedule (typically housed with accounting staff) or from your 
purchasing manager, if he or she is charged with asset management. (If you 
operate a very small business, turn to your tax returns for this info instead.) 
Then assign an estimated life expectancy to each asset based on the date the 
equipment was purchased so that you can efficiently plan for green replace-
ments in your budget. Note: This step will likely require a conversation with 
the office manager, purchasing guru, or company accountant — all of whom 
should have the appropriate records if you don’t.
Taking stock of your current office equipment’s expiration dates can also 
help you get a grasp on your e-waste volume and address the own-or-lease 
question outlined in the later “Opting for utility over ownership” section.
A quick primer on choosing and disposing of CFLs
If there’s one icon of the green movement, it’s 
the swirly, ice cream cone–looking compact 
fluorescent light bulb (CFL). This little guy can 
cut your energy expenses by up to 80 percent 
simply by installing it. Shopping for anything, 
whether it’s for personal or professional life, 
is always a little daunting the first go around. 
Because CFLs have only been on the scene a 
few years, I provide you with some guidance as 
to what you should be looking for in the sea of 
new lighting lingo and labels:
 ✓ Choose the color temperature of the bulb. 
Around 2700K is a warm white (which looks 
just like an incandescent), and around 
5000K constitutes a cool white (which gives 
off a white-blue light).
 ✓ Choose the appropriate number of watts. 
Watts measure energy used, whereas 
lumens measure light strength. A quick rule 
of thumb when converting incandescent 
wattage to CFL wattage is to divide by four. 
So, for example, if you want to switch from 
a 100-watt incandescent, you’ll be safe with 
about a 25-watt CFL.
 ✓ Choose the right shape for your fixture. 
CFLs are available in a variety of shapes to 
fit a range of lamps and lighting fixtures.
 ✓ Find a local place to recycle CFLs. These 
efficient little bulbs have one problem — 
they contain trace amounts of mercury. 
Recycling is available at IKEA (find the 
store closest to you at www.ikea.com) 
and possibly at your local hardware store 
or recycling center.

Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Replacing old equipment with green alternatives
Your primary purchasing policy modification may mandate an office equip-
ment replacement policy that requires obsolete office pieces (think the junky 
copier that only works three days out of the week, or the fax machine that 
long since stopped printing every page) be replaced with a certified Energy 
Star equivalent. Products with Energy Star ratings, on average, use 25 to 50 
percent less energy than their traditional counterparts. And depending on 
the item in question, this energy savings can quickly offer a significant contri-
bution to the return on your capital investment.
Of course, choosing a model that meets your operational needs varies as 
widely as the type of tasks you’re asking the equipment to perform. When 
comparing costs of certified versus noncertified equipment, keep in mind 
that Energy Star–labeled computers, monitors, fax machines, copiers, or 
printers usually save more than $80 per product, per year.
 
If you’re prioritizing replacement by projected savings, consider the following 
high-impact change-outs:
 
✓ Copiers: These gluttons use more energy per unit than any other piece 
of office equipment. Without power management, most of the energy is 
expended when the copier is inactive. To receive Energy Star certifica-
tion, a copier must have automatic duplexing capabilities because it 
takes ten times as much energy to produce a piece of paper as it does to 
place an image on one.
 
✓ Computers: Consider requiring that all new computer purchases be 
Energy Star–certified. Because of the huge amount of hours computers 
are used every day, the EPA’s requirements for computers and their 
peripherals are very demanding. The Energy Star logo assures you that 
energy savings are embodied in a qualifying computer’s stand-by, sleep, 
and active modes, and that more efficient internal power supplies are 
used.
 
✓ Monitors: More than 50 percent of energy expended on a desktop com-
puter system is attributable to the monitor. An Energy Star–qualified 
monitor uses 90 percent less electricity than a monitor without power 
management.
 
✓ Printers and fax machines: Printers can only be assessed based on 
which category they belong to. Each category yields a wide range of 
energy-consumption patterns. For instance, laser and LED printers with 
power-management systems can use less than half the energy of a con-
ventional laser model. But the real efficient worker is the old-fashioned 
ink jet, which uses less energy because it doesn’t require heat fusion to 
function. In general, printers that have earned the Energy Star certifica-
tion use 60 percent less energy than their competitors.

111

Don’t be fooled by the abundance of pseudo Energy Star logos (“energy 
smart,” “energy solutions,” and so on) that may trick you into thinking an item 
has complied with EPA energy-reduction parameters. The only EPA-
sanctioned logo is Energy Star. Visit www.energystar.gov, click the 
Buildings & Plants link, and then click the Purchasing & Procurement link in 
the Quick Finder box on the right-hand side of the page. From there, simply

your office.
Greening your IT department
For companies with an IT department, a ton of opportunities exist to radically 
reduce energy consumption — and save money in the process. Involving 
your IT professional in a discussion surrounding any comprehensive mid- 
and long-term design strategies is imperative if you want to green the depart-
ment successfully.
 
Here are some questions you can pose to IT pros to get the conversation 
flowing:
 
✓ Do we need the server on 24/7? Actively managing your server for 
energy efficiency may be an energy-reduction target area for you. The 
average server costs $700 per year to run in a low utility rate area, 
according to Ken Brill with the Uptime Institute. Between 10 and 30 
percent of the energy consumption in a typical data center is for servers 
and storage that most businesses don’t actively manage.
Decoding Energy Star and EPEAT
As you investigate more sustainable office 
equipment and products, you’re probably going 
to run across the terms Energy Star and EPEAT 
quite frequently. Here’s what they mean and 
why they’re relevant:
 ✓ Energy Star is an ecolabeling program 
developed and administered by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
The logo, which you can read more about 
and see in Chapter 10, is now used in 
many countries. It signifies that the item in 
question possesses a high level of energy 
efficiency. The Energy Star rating is available 
in more than 50 product categories, including 
appliances, computers/peripherals, build-
ings, and many consumer products.
 ✓ EPEAT is a system developed by the Institute 
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers to 
help purchasers assess desktops, moni-
tors, and notebooks. Check out the EPEAT 
Registered Products Search Tool found at 
www.epeat.net to see at a glance how 
the listed product categories match up with 
three tiers of environmental performance.

112
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Where is the data center housed? Heat management in data centers is 
a trying issue for all companies. Analyze it from both facilities’ and IT’s 
requirement standpoints to ensure that the location within the facility 
optimizes the HVAC system as well as IT needs.
 
There’s a whole new movement of IT professionals collaborating on how to 
maximize computing performance while reducing environmental impact. 
To catch the wave (or to find such an IT pro if you don’t already have one 
onboard), check out the Association of Information Technology Professionals

two days of sustainability-oriented discussions. Also, try signing up for 
Greener Computing (www.greenercomputing.com), a free weekly e-news-
letter that offers a column and access to all the current green techie journal 
articles you can possibly ingest.
Reducing Waste
 
As your company begins to recognize that reducing usage on the front end also 
reduces the need to manage waste on the back end, your costs will begin to 
decrease. Cost considerations include employee/contractor time for folks who 
manage recycling efforts and the cost of receptacles, as well as the opportunity 
cost of space dedicated to recycling (if it takes potential workspace). Also, 
purchasing nondisposable items, such as office and breakroom supplies, for 
example) may cost more upfront, but doing so yields savings in the long term.
Office waste is often heavily made up of paper, nonfunctional electronics, 
disposable supplies, and packaging. Cutting down on all that miscellaneous 
waste requires figuring out ways to reuse products, reduce absolute usage 
(as well as reliance on disposable products), and recycle those objects that 
can’t be reused or cut back on as easily. In the following sections, I show you 
how to zero in on the amount of waste currently generated at your office and 
how to cut that number down through waste-reduction and recycling efforts.
Obviously, some money will need to be thrown into this effort, but keeping 
it to a minimum is a good idea. When considering the design of a recycling 
center, for example, you don’t need the most expensive, heavy-duty bins if 
your center is located inside the building. Also, sometimes recycling services 
provide complimentary bins. If yours doesn’t, you can use large cardboard 
appliance boxes; these serve the receptacle purpose perfectly well.
 
Behavior change is one thing, more work is another. The more convenient you 
make behavior change for your employees, the more likely they’ll climb onboard 
the waste-reduction train and come up with innovative ways to decrease your 
company’s waste stream. Diffusing resistance to change isn’t always easy. The 
best advice I can give is to ease into changes slowly and offer lots of accolades 
for the efforts being made. Keep communicating about the importance of 
becoming a green company that’s poised to function in the new ecoera.

Use the following tips to expand your communication efforts to new and 
existing employees:
 
✓ Train new employees. Communicate your expectations that resources 
should be used carefully and that each person should fully participate 
in waste-reduction programs. Explain how to prevent waste and recycle 
materials.
 
✓ Use employee events and gatherings to promote waste reduction. 
Show what’s being done well and what areas need improvement.
 
✓ Solicit ideas from employees. Involve your workforce in the company’s 
waste-reduction efforts to give them ownership of the program.
 
✓ Ask employees to sign a waste-reduction pledge. Research shows that 
when a person signs his or her name to something, that individual has a 
higher propensity to carry through with the action.
Conducting a waste assessment
Getting a grasp on where to look for areas where you can cut back your 
waste is simpler than you may think. Start by compiling a list of all the dif-
ferent places waste originates (taking a close look at workrooms, restrooms, 
cafeterias, breakrooms, and individual offices), specifically addressing
 
✓ Discarded office supplies, packaging, and other general personal waste. 
Look at the contents of central collection bins where individual baskets 
are dumped.
 
✓ Obsolete equipment and furniture and fixtures.
 
✓ Lawn and garden detritus. Try to get an idea of the quantity and size of 
leaves, grass, and other trimmings that are dumped. How many bags 
per week are dumped, and how many weeks per year does this dumping 
occur?
 
The key to lassoing in the amount of waste generated in your office is to first 
figure out the source point: Where is waste generated?
 
You may want to actually take a close peek at your facility’s dumpsters to get 
a preliminary idea as to what’s in ’em. Figure 6-1 offers a sample worksheet 
you can use to fill in what you see.
After you know how much waste your business is generating, determine 
how much of it is potentially recyclable. This amount will be specific to your 
locale and may require a call to your waste-removal provider or recycling 
service to get a list of potential recyclables. Additionally, many communities 
have a special center for lawn trimmings. You may consider letting grass 
trimming mulch rather than wasting costly and unnecessary lawn bags, as 
well as landfill space.

Exploring quick and easy 
waste-reducing actions
Not all waste-reduction projects are time-intensive. Some general tips of the 
trade for reducing office waste (and causing an immediate impact on your 
triple bottom line!) include
 
✓ Reducing business junk mail: You can start by checking out the 
resources found at the Business Junk Mail Reduction Project (your.
kingcounty.gov/solidwaste/nwpc; click the Reduce Business 
Junk Mail link). You can also register your company’s name and mailing 
address to get employees who’ve left your organization off of mailing 
lists via the EcoLogical Mail Coalition’s Web site (www.ecological
mail.org). The service is free, but be prepared to give it six months 
before you see a direct reduction in business junk mail.
 
✓ Banning colored papers, high-gloss products, and the like that aren’t 
recyclable: Notice that many product tags, labels, and inserts, as well as 
marketing materials, are now imprinted on unbleached, recycled paper.
 
✓ Making cloth tote bags available so that plastic bags aren’t needed 
for office shopping trips: Depending on how many quick trips you 
make from your office, you could wind up saving quite a few bags every 
month.
 
✓ Ridding the office of disposable items: Compostable alternatives are 
available for many disposable breakroom products, such as paper 
plates, napkins, plastic cutlery, and cups. Office supplies, such as refill-
able pens, are much greener than throwaways. Batteries should be 
rechargeable; 15 billion batteries are produced a year and a large major-
ity of them are alkaline disposables. Question anything that’s disposable 
and ask your vendor or office supply store if there are any reusable or 
compostable alternatives to the product in question.

115
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
 
✓ Ending your supply of Styrofoam cups for coffee and asking employ-
ees to bring their own coffee mugs: You’ll be reducing your business’s 
footprint and encouraging staff to actively engage in a greening effort 
that’s easy and feels good.
 
✓ Removing bottled water from vending machines and office refrigera-
tors: Interestingly enough, the Environmental Protection Agency’s stan-
dards for tap water are more stringent than standards set forth by the 
Food & Drug Administration for bottled water, so get rid of the bottled 
water and return to good old water from the tap. If your company is 
located in a place where tap water doesn’t taste good or may be of a 
suspicious quality, install a faucet filter to remove trace chemicals and 
bacteria.
 
 The amount of fossil fuels consumed in the extraction, production, 
packaging, and transportation of bottled water is truly stunning. Then 
there’s that nasty disposal problem. Estimates on the number of dispos-
able water bottles that wind up in American landfills range from 10 to 28 
billion (yes, with a b). Peter Gleick, a water policy expert and director at 
the Pacific Institute, estimates that when you add up the energy impact 
of the entire life cycle of a bottle of water, it’s like “filling up a quarter 
of every bottle with oil.” Additionally, it takes approximately 3 liters of 
extracted water to produce 1 actual liter of bottled water.
 
 Have a local vendor make hard-plastic water bottles with your logo and 
company name on them and give ’em out as Christmas presents. Make 
sure they’re the new Bisphenol A (BPA) free bottles, available from a 
prominent outdoor hydration company.
Minimizing paper waste
As you’re looking to decrease usage of natural capital in your daily office 
life, minimizing paper used plays an important role. Those reams of paper 
come from trees that sequester carbon dioxide, which helps to minimize 
the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Fewer trees mean more carbon in 
the atmosphere. In addition, milling, packaging, and transporting paper are 
all highly energy-intensive activities. For example, the Palo Alto Research 
Center’s study shows that it takes the equivalent of 60 watt-hours of energy 
to produce one single sheet of paper. That’s for production only — not for 
transporting that sheet or imprinting an image on it. The real shocker comes 
from the nonprofit Conservatree (www.conservatree.com): A ton of (non-
recycled) printing and office paper uses 24 trees (a mix of softwood and hard-
wood trees standing 40 feet tall and 6 to 8 inches in diameter).
Recycling paper saves trees and uses 60 percent less energy than manufac-
turing paper from virgin timber. In addition, producing recycled paper causes 
74 percent less air pollution and 35 percent less water pollution, and it cre-
ates five times the number of jobs as producing virgin paper does.

116
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
Despite the benefits of recycling paper, make reducing your paper use your 
true goal. Why? Because recycling paper is still energy intensive. Whether you 
establish a company-wide goal or ask each department for a reduction goal 
depends on your company size and organizational culture.
 
To help identify your opportunities for reducing paper waste, ask for three to 
five specific paper-reduction strategies from each department of the company 
so you can investigate the ideas for potential. After all, most managers know 
intuitively where the majority of their paper usage is concentrated. If HR still 
runs paper paychecks, this department may submit “converting to electronic 
checks” as one of its ideas. Likewise, marketing may have long considered 
changing up its advertising mix to focus more on an online presence and less 
on largely ineffective, paper-wasting mass mailers.
Want to get the ball rolling without waiting for the feedback of various 
departments? Try implementing some of these simple ways to decrease the 
amount of paper generated in your office:
 
✓ Edit documents on your PC rather than on hard copies. This is an easy 
and efficient way to save paper. In fact, the more you do it, the easier it 
becomes.
 
✓ Take paper that has been printed on one side and convert it to note 
pads. By doing so, you get two lives out of one piece of paper. If printing 
hard copies is absolutely necessary, you can also print drafts of docu-
ments on the back sides of printed paper. When you’re done with the 
draft, recycle it instead of trashing it.
 
✓ Require 
1⁄2-inch margins on all documents. This move can save up to 
one page for every three pages printed. Pretty impressive for a couple 
clicks of a mouse! The easiest way to make this change is to adjust the 
defaults to Narrow if you’re using Microsoft Word. Doing so sets margins to 
a 
1⁄2 inch on the top, bottom, left, and right portions of the page. In other 
programs, look for the screen to set margins in and choose Custom. The 
view may take a bit to get used to because there’s more text on the page, 
but after a month, you’ll feel like your documents have always looked 
this way.
 
✓ Print on both sides of the paper. Double-sided printing is a no-brainer 
and deserves to be a mandatory policy in your office. Review your 
printer’s manual to make sure it can automatically handle duplex print-
ing (a fancy term for double-sided). Alternatively, you can check out the 
print dialog area in word-processing documents. Click the Properties 
menu, review the options, and scan for Duplex Printing or Two-Sided 
Printing. If you see either term, then your printer is configured to handle 
automatic duplex printing. (Note: If you have several printers, you need 
to check out each one individually to assess its automatic double-sided 
copying potential. However, if your printer also functions as a copier 
and is capable of double-sided copying, you’re probably good to go for 
automatic duplexing.)

117
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
 
 If your printer isn’t equipped for automatic duplexing, you’ll have to do 
your double-sided printing manually — meaning you first send a print 
job and print the odd-numbered pages Then you flip those pages over 
and print the even-numbered pages. To do this, go to the print dialog 
box and check Manual Duplex. It may take a few practice sessions to 
figure out how to pull the paper out and flip it so that the second page is 
right side up on the back of the first page. After you’ve figured it out for 
your printer, post a note nearby so that everyone in your office can 
easily see how to manually print double-sided.
 
 Certain older printers don’t support duplex printing in any format. When 
you send this printer to e-waste heaven, make sure that your procurement 
policy states that all future printers must be capable of duplex printing.
 
✓ Invest in green printing software. Some printers are now being bundled 
with green printing software called GreenPrint. This program neatly 
identifies and eliminates unnecessary pages (like those containing only a 
legal disclaimer, URL address, or Web banners) and converts files auto-
matically to PDF format for easy document sharing. It also tracks the 
number of pages and associated costs so you can capture the savings 
and toot your own green horn. The average savings per user is about 
$90 and 1,400 pieces of paper annually. You can check out the details at 
www.printgreener.com.
Purchasing environmentally friendly goods
You may be hesitant to lay out more money upfront for a green product that 
doesn’t appear to enhance business value in the short term. But as you move 
toward triple-bottom-line thinking, you’ll start to see the value in measuring 
purchases in longer time frames and by their impact on people, planet, and 
profit. Purchasing products that don’t end up in your waste stream and need 
to be repurchased again and again is clearly beneficial to all three bottom lines.
Following are some environmentally friendly office products for your con-
sideration. Note: It doesn’t matter which of these items you start using first; 
using any of ’em is an important ecostep in the right direction!
 
✓ Solar-power devices: These solar chargers can contribute to reducing 
waste from disposed batteries and nonrenewable energy usage. They 
sport onboard battery packs that juice up while the solar cells are har-
vesting those wonderful renewable rays. The battery packs then deliver 
the power, on demand, to your device of choice. The options for on-the-
go solar power are growing, so be sure to check them out carefully.
 
 These devices are new to the market, but you can keep abreast of new 
discussion out there in cyberspace at blogs.consumerreports.org/
electronics. Just type “solar power mobile” (or whatever particular 
device you’re interested in seeing others’ opinions of) into the search 
engine and see who’s saying what.

118
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Rechargeable electronics and a battery charger: By investing in 
rechargeables, you can eliminate an unnecessary source of office waste 
in a snap. After all, just consider the number of office products that 
require batteries: cell phones, office tools, Bluetooth devices, laptops, 
digital and video camcorders, and PDAs.
 
✓ Recycled toner cartridges: Lots of outlets sell toner and offer price 
breaks on new cartridges for trading in the old ones. The old cartridges 
are then refilled and sold at a discount. The number of times a particular 
type of cartridge can be refilled is limited. For example, laser printers 
come with a drum that in most cases can only be refilled once or twice.
 
 Unfortunately, using refilled cartridges in new equipment will void the 
manufacturer’s warranty should a problem arise, so you may want 
to wait until a printer’s warranty expires to begin using recycled car-
tridges. In the meantime, save your spent cartridges because they can 
be refilled and used when the warranty is up.
 
✓ Undated and erasable wall calendars: Forget those disposable paper cal-
endars and make the one-time investment in an item that virtually never 
needs to be replaced. This is a super-easy to eliminate waste at your office.
 
✓ Paper that’s responsibly produced: The three most important factors to 
look at when seeking out responsibly produced office paper include the 
following:
 
• Post-consumer waste (PCW) paper: Based on your printing volume 
and the price differential, begin the transition to PCW paper. This 
may be something you phase into. For example, a transitional 
period may include a plan to immediately institute a minimum 
PCW content of 50 percent, with 100 percent as the goal within 12 
months. Always look for unbleached paper.
 
• Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification: The Council is 
a nonprofit organization that certifies forest products that use 
responsibly harvested fibers. When purchasing virgin paper, look 
for the FSC stamp (shown in Chapter 10). However, purchasing 
recycled paper over virgin paper should always be a priority.
 
• Bleaching method: When purchasing white paper, look for non-
chlorine-based bleaches. PCF (which stands for processed chlorine 
free) is the most desirable for recycled fiber; TCF (which stands for 
totally chlorine free) is the way to go for virgin fiber.
Developing an office recycling program
 
When it comes to starting up an office recycling program, first and foremost, 
you have to solicit senior management’s buy-in to the whole recycling scene. 
Not only do you require their support but you also need to garner their 
budget approval for your start-up costs. Resource allocation is a must, with 
the goal being to grow the organizational and environmental impact as the 

119
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
plan increases in scope. Office recycling is an imperative program when your 
company is greening, and it’s easy to tie in from a mission-congruence stand-
point (less waste, better for the environment).
The next few sections outline how you can design a comprehensive recycling 
program for your place of business.
Identifying your recycling program’s leadership
To have a successful office recycling program, you need to appoint a recycling 
coordinator who can manage all facets of the effort. The most critical criterion 
in selecting this person is that he or she is truly interested in the program. The 
obvious place to look within your organization is the facilities department, but 
that’s not mandatory. The recycling coordinator can come from any depart-
ment, but be aware that as the program grows, it may be necessary to modify 
this person’s job description accordingly. Try using encouraging phrases like 
“This is a great opportunity to demonstrate leadership skills” and offering 
incentivizing caveats when you begin recruiting for your program’s leadership.
The recycling coordinator may need to organize a recycling task force. 
Depending on the size of your organization, this task force may include rep-
resentation from each department within the company. Make sure to get the 
building custodians’ input and concerns right upfront. They’re the ones who’ll 
have the skinny on content, process, and ways to streamline any preliminary 
ideas, because they’re mostly in charge of the day-to-day waste handling.
Designing a collection system for recyclables
An efficient and effective office recycling program also requires a game plan. 
That’s why designing an internal collection system for recyclables within your 
organization is essential. Your system will vary based on the size of your orga-
nization and whether you occupy seven floors in a Manhattan high rise; are 
disbursed over two office campuses in Puget Sound; or are a small, remote, rural 
operation north of El Paso. The person who designs the system will also depend 
on your individual organization’s characteristics. If your business is quite small, 
then the recycling coordinator designs the program; if your business is mid-
sized, you can probably have the whole recycling task force chip in.
 
Regardless, the primary consideration for all entities is the same: You need to 
make recycling as convenient as possible for both the employees and the col-
lection staff.
Carefully consider the following:
 
✓ What you’re going to collect the recyclable materials in: As you con-
duct your waste assessment (see the earlier related section within this 
chapter), notice the volume of each type of recyclable and attempt to 
identify what sort of receptacle may be appropriate, according to size 
and ease of use. Office paper requires a different bin than broken-down 
boxes. Some considerations include

120
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
• How much space you have available
 
• How many of each type of bin will be necessary
 
✓ Where the containers are going to be located: Placement is para-
mount, so locate recycling bins close to individual workstations as well 
as within areas of concentrated waste generation — cafeterias, break-
rooms, and copying/printing centers. Make sure to use the space effi-
ciently. Too many bins are a waste of space; not enough bins results in 
chronically full tubs and a lack of employee participation.
 
✓ How you’ll instruct staff to separate the landfill-bound office debris 
from the recyclable stuff, and the different types of recyclables from 
one another: Signage by recycling bins is very important, because the 
collection area is an important space to display educational materials. 
Tell people what can and can’t go into each bin. Lots of folks simply 
don’t know that paper clips don’t belong in office-paper recycling or that 
plastic bottles need to be emptied of all liquids before chucking them in 
the container.
 
✓ Who’s responsible for the collection and how often will collection 
take place: For example, who’s going to move the recycling containers 
from workstations, the cafeteria, the lawn maintenance area, and the like 
to the centralized storage area for collection or delivery? (See the later 
section “Designating a centralized storage area for the collection” for 
more on assigning your centralized spot.) The other side of the equation 
is the frequency of your collection. Try to coordinate pickups when the 
bins have reached their capacity, knowing that the timing may vary by 
time of year or location.
 
✓ How you’ll get recyclables to their final destination: Depending on 
where your company is located, some materials will be picked up 
curbside, and some will need to be processed (bundled, shredded, or 
crushed) in preparation for the end users. Does this processing 
require any specialized equipment? How often do these tasks need to be 
performed? Who will do that, and after the materials are ready to move 
on to recycling heaven, how are they moved there? These are all questions 
you’ll need to think about so that your recycling efforts can be the 
shining green star in your office’s ecoefforts.
 
Modifications to your system will be necessary, so don’t be discouraged when 
the need arises to make some.
Designating a centralized storage area for the collection
Most recycling services pick up from one area, so you need to designate a 
specific spot as the go-to point for your recycling efforts. Will this recycling 
center be located inside your facility or outside of it? If inside, allocate ample 
space for the selected receptacles. If outside, make sure the bins have covers 
to provide security against local critters. Depending on your part of the coun-
try, anything from bears or raccoons to rats can invade your recycling stash, 
leaving a less-than-pretty sight in its wake.

121
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
Pitching the idea to the higher-ups
Unfortunately, an officewide recycling program isn’t the easiest project to 
sell upper management on. Setting up such a program often requires initial 
capital outlay, ongoing maintenance, an internal person (or team) committed 
to getting it going, and behavioral changes. However, if you’ve already picked 
some of the low-hanging fruit from the energy-conservation tree (see the 
section “Starting with the low-hanging fruit,” earlier in this chapter), you can 
point to those savings to fund the initial resources needed to get the office 
recycling gig going.
Or you can always attempt to sway management with some real-life success 
stories, like that of Ben Franklin Press in Napa, California. This company insti-
tuted a program to distribute leftover paper/scrap to local schools and recy-
cle all cardboard and uncoated paper. Its waste-reduction efforts reduced 
the company’s waste-disposal fees by $500 per month and benefitted local 
schoolchildren. Talk about a triple-bottom-line winner!
 
Following are some tips to help you pitch your recycling program idea:
 
✓ Get your foot in the door. Meeting with the right people is critical and 
usually doable in a small business. In mid-sized organizations, the right 
folks aren’t always apparent, so you have to seek them out.
 
✓ Determine which decision-makers are crucial to your waste-reduction 
program. Depending on your company’s size, the CEO, owner, or other 
senior managers have the ability to make decisions about operations, 
purchasing, products, packaging, and services. Figure out who makes 
those calls in your company and start there.
 
✓ Network. If you don’t have direct access to the decision-makers, find 
people in your organization who do. Ask for their suggestions on 
approach. For example, ask whether you should make a presentation. If 
so, should that presentation contain details or a mere overview? (Some 
managers like to approve general concepts; others want statistics and 
research before considering a new idea).
 
✓ Make your presentation clear, factual, and persuasive. Stress the fact 
that if waste can’t be reduced voluntarily today, the business may face 
mandated changes in the future.
As you implement your plan, incrementally or in total, make sure to leave 
room for assessing its performance. Use a formal evaluation tool that asks 
maintenance staff, accounting folks, employees, and waste managers (proces-
sors, haulers, or end users) to help you calculate the percentage of waste 
reduction the program has generated. You should have an idea of what your 
company’s waste volume looks like on a weekly basis thanks to your baseline 
assessment (see the earlier section “Conducting a waste assessment” if you 
skipped this step). Anything being recycled and diverted from the landfill 
should be considered a success!

122
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Arranging for end-of-life 
recycling for electronics
A critical piece of analyzing the environmental footprint of your office is to 
consider in advance what’s going to happen to your office electronics when 
you’re done using them. Electronic waste (known as e-waste) now poses 
the fastest growing element of manufacturing waste in North America due 
to a number of unique problems. Circuit boards, batteries, monitors, color 
cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and batteries all contain heavy metals such as 
mercury, hexavalent chromium, and lead. When these metals are improperly 
disposed of (that is, thrown in a landfill), toxins may leach into groundwater 
or be released into the air.
As the volume of e-waste (and society’s understanding of its negative impact) 
has mounted, more businesses are trying to figure out how to responsibly 
handle this new waste stream. In the European Union, for example, a new 
directive mandated that the producers of electronic products take them back 
and deal with their end-of-life liability issues. Guess what happened in the EU 
in response? The focus of product design for electronics shifted to easy dis-
assembly and recyclability, because disposal of heavy, metal-laden articles is 
no longer an option.
 
Ask your office equipment vendor whether it has a take-back policy, a type of 
voluntary policy (or a law in some states) that requires a manufacturer to take 
back its products at the end of their useful lives, thereby placing the onus for 
disposal on the original producer.
 
You can also consider taking advantage of the booming electronics recycling 
business. But before you hand off your e-waste, be sure to research the col-
lection firm. Many of these so-called recycling businesses are selling the old 
electronics to e-waste “brokers.” The discarded electronics are then shipped 
to developing countries with negligible environmental standards (primarily 
India, Kenya, and China) where 25-cent-per-hour laborers (often children) 
remove valuable parts like circuit boards and burn off the plastic on electrical 
cords over charcoal fires to harvest the copper wire. The remaining worthless 
parts are dumped and remain to contaminate the local area. These “recyclers” 
are in fact expending a ton of fossil fuels to move heavy metals from North 
American landfills to the “disposal sites” of the developing world.
 
To find a reputable e-waste recycler, go to the list of e-stewards found at the 
Basel Action Network (BAN) Web site (www.ban.org). BAN is a nonprofit 
group that monitors the global toxic waste trade, providing a qualified list of 
North American recyclers called e-stewards — responsible recyclers that have 
signed the BAN pledge and met all disassembly and recycling environmental 
regulations. Many of these organizations have mail-in service for electronics 
recycling. (Note: Recycling e-waste is a budgetary line item. I’m not going to 
kid you about that. It should be incorporated in the IT budget.)

Changing Purchasing Practices 
for Office Supplies
Implementing green office purchasing policies goes a long way toward reduc-
ing your office’s carbon footprint. Major water, waste, and energy-reduction 
initiatives can all be driven in large part by your company’s purchasing poli-
cies. Chapter 7 offers detailed coverage of how your company can green its 
supply chain, so suffice it to say that many of the action items referred to in 
this chapter (such as rethinking whether ownership of office equipment is 
necessary and adopting sustainable office supply purchasing policies) origi-
nate from within your company rather than from without.
 
In very small organizations, one or two people may purchase the office sup-
plies. In a mid-sized organization, however, you can probably find a central-
ized purchasing department. Modifications in procurement policy play a big 
role in either setup.
Opting for utility over ownership
One of the four premises of Natural Capitalism (see Chapter 3 for a more in-
depth explanation of this sustainability framework) is converting a product-
based economy to a service and flow economy. A service and flow economy 
contributes to increased value for the customer and betters the bottom line 
for the vendor, because both parties’ interests are now aligned. Basically, it 
favors the concept of opting for utility over ownership.
Ownership of many items that businesses rely on to conduct operations isn’t 
necessarily desirable. Often what businesses want are the services that the items 
provide. For example, many small and mid-sized enterprises aren’t necessarily 
interested in owning copiers, faxes, computers, HVAC units, commercial carpets, 
or office furniture. Instead, they want the utility of those items — they desire the 
functions these objects can provide for their businesses.
Transferring responsibilities of ownership to the company that produces the 
goods you need changes all the rules of the game. Suddenly, these compa-
nies are intimately vested in producing high-quality, durable products that 
efficiently provide the services they’re intended to. Additionally, companies 
become interested in their products’ end-of-life liability issues, disposal 
costs, recyclability, and so on.
Just look at what one company was able to do. Ray Anderson, president of 
the international flooring systems company Interface, Inc., was a visionary in 
reconfiguring the company’s primary product — commercial carpet tiles — 
into a service. Instead of selling commercial carpeting, Interface leases 
the tiles, replacing high-traffic-area tiles as they wear out. The old tiles are 

124
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
remanufactured into new tiles as part of the lease costs. In this closed-loop 
system, raw material use decreases dramatically and zero waste becomes an 
achievable goal. In short, everyone wins!
 
Ask your vendors about leasing programs or actively solicit new vendors that 
engage in them.
 
An added bonus of opting for utility over ownership is that the customer thus 
converts a capital expenditure (which is written off over time through depre-
ciation expense) into an immediate deduction, thereby decreasing his taxable 
income and reducing his corporate tax bill. Doing more with less doesn’t 
sound half bad now, huh?
Considering the source of your supplies
One aspect of sustainability includes the source of products or services, in an 
environmental capacity as well as a socially responsible capacity. Acquiring 
your office supplies from a sustainable vendor counts just as much toward 
positioning yourself as a truly green business as the sustainability of the end 
product you offer your customers. Fortunately, you have control over the 
sourcing of your office supplies.
 
✓ Choose to source your office supplies as close to home as possible. 
Ideally, your office essentials should come from your local region or 
from within North America. If you require a certain item that has to 
come from far away, make sure to look for sweatshop-free designations, 
usually offered by reputable third parties.
 
✓ Incorporate specific sustainability requirements when requesting 
bids. Depending on what it is you’re sourcing, identify what green 
attributes you want to see incorporated in that product or service and 
specify that in the bid. For example, tell office equipment vendors that 
you want a fax machine that handles PCW paper or insist that your lawn 
care company use natural fertilizers.
 
✓ Specify Energy Star–certified or EPEAT–qualified products in your 
contracts or purchase orders. The Energy Star rating signifies that the item 
in question possesses a high level of energy efficiency. EPEAT provides a 
similar assessment for computers (both desktop and laptop) and monitors.
 
It may be helpful to award your office contracts based on a point system. Of 
course, that leads to the question of how many points do you allocate for 
green product attributes and how many do you give to a vendor that actively 
practices corporate social responsibility. The answer is truly up to you and 
your individual business needs and preferences. Depending on what you 
decide you want to emphasize and how your procurement system works, 
assigning additional points for desirable attributes can be a way to lean 
toward selecting greener suppliers.

Shelling out for sustainable 
and nontoxic office items
Purchasing environmentally sound office products, both for daily use 
(supplies) as well as long-term use (furniture and fixtures) is an important 
part of greening your office. The costs may be higher for some of these 
products. However, as the number of suppliers and available alternatives 
increase, prices are decreasing for many items. In each of the next few sec-
tions, I cover the specific cost-benefit issues related to common office items 
that you can replace with green alternatives. Of course, any recycled-content 
or local purchases you make are an integral part of messaging your company 
as one that isn’t just thinking sustainably but is also acting accordingly.
Ecofriendly office décor
When considering decorating your office with sustainable purchases, you may 
find that seemingly similar items cost more upfront. But at the same time, the 
overall costs are less because that bamboo bookcase will last longer than its 
cheaper, foreign alternative. Consequently, you’ll get more lifetime usage from it, 
thereby decreasing the item’s overall costs. Additionally, depending on the par-
ticulars of the product, green office décor items don’t contribute to poor indoor 
air quality through the distribution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Textiles should be from a readily renewable and natural source (such as 
bamboo, hemp, wool, or organic cotton). Picture frames should be made 
from recyclable parts and be easy to disassemble and recycle. (Wood frames 
in particular should be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.) Glues, 
foams, adhesives, coatings, and solvents should be water- or biobased, mean-
ing they’re nontoxic and don’t release VOCs.
 
Lots of companies are jumping onboard and touting green pieces in their 
product lines, so when shopping for sustainable office décor, make sure to 
ask questions to protect yourself against greenwashing (when a business 
states that it’s green without taking the actions necessary to back up that 
statement). Probe as to third-party certifications and what specific attributes 
make a product sustainable.
Green cleaning supplies
Environmentally friendly office cleaning supplies were forever fairly obscure, 
very expensive, and often not as effective as their chemically based counter-
parts. Luckily, this product group has evolved dramatically — in large part 
due to the nasty side effects of toxins and VOCs found in traditional cleaning 
supplies, which read like a laundry list of health hazards.

126
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Purchasing green cleaning products is an issue that’s making a big splash in 
the media of late. You may be questioning why your business would want 
to spend the extra money to purchase these items. Consider the following 
triple-bottom-line ramifications:
 
✓ Worker safety and health issues: The list of hazardous chemicals con-
tained in traditional cleaning supplies is truly staggering. Exposure to 
these toxins, particularly if your office facilities don’t have adequate ven-
tilation, can directly affect workers’ health, productivity, and morale. So 
clearly switching to green cleaning supplies is a boon for the people part 
of the triple bottom line.
 
✓ Disposal costs: This one affects both the planet and profit aspects of 
the triple bottom line. Any leftover toxic office products must be dis-
posed of in an approved manner. You can’t pour them down the drain, 
into storm sewers, or in the trash because of the polluting compounds 
they’re made of. Recycling and disposing of hazardous materials isn’t 
free, but with nontoxic cleaning supplies, these costs disappear.
Raising the bar on office furniture
Herman Miller has won a number of design 
awards, including a Smithsonian National 
Design Award, for its beautiful, green office fur-
niture. This furniture manufacturer, with more 
than $1.5 billion in annual revenues, produces 
its furniture in a LEED-certified green building 
in Zeeland, Michigan. The company’s sustain-
ability efforts are encompassed in its “Perfect 
Vision Program: 2020” — an internal deadline 
to achieve an ambitious range of sustainabil-
ity targets, including zero landfill impact, zero 
hazardous waste generation, zero carbon emis-
sions from manufacturing, and a minimum LEED 
Silver certification for all facilities.
Herman Miller already uses 100-percent green 
energy to meet its power needs and has formally 
instituted a Design for the Environment product 
evaluation method (see Chapter 7 for more on 
this approach to product design). Its protocol for 
sustainability looks at each proposed product in 
terms of material chemistry, ease of disassem-
bly, recyclability, and recycled content.
The company’s award winning Mirra chair is 
96-percent recyclable and contains 42-percent 
recycled material. It has no polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) and is produced using green energy. The 
textile is hemp, which doesn’t require pesticides. 
New work surface materials were introduced in 
2004, including bamboo veneer. Herman Miller’s 
quest for sustainability is apparent in everything 
it does and is a real inspiration to all companies 
looking to increase their greening efforts.
Herman Miller has been honored with Business 
Ethics magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens 
designation and has been repeatedly cited by 
Fortune magazine as the Most Admired com-
pany in its industry. The laundry list of awards it 
has received is a testament to how well Herman 
Miller’s greening efforts have served its corpo-
rate image. You can see this list for yourself 
by going to www.hermanmiller.com, 
clicking the About Us link (in the Just brows-
ing column), clicking the Who We Are link, and 
then clicking the Awards and Recognition link 
on the right-hand side of the page.

So what exactly are natural cleaners?
 
✓ They’re made from natural, renewable resources such as citrus oils, 
coconuts, and other plant-based materials.
 
✓ Their ingredients are all biodegradable.
 
✓ They’re cruelty free, meaning no animals were used in their testing.
 
✓ They’re completely (or almost completely) free of petroleum, and 
they’re totally free of phosphorus and bleach.
 
✓ They don’t use aerosols.
 
If your cleaning supplies manufacturer claims that its components are organic, 
sustainably harvested, toxin free, and/or recyclable, great! But who says so? 
Always double-check that all certifications are legit. If your inquiries provoke 
discomfort or a downright blank look, you can feel reasonably sure that this 
line of supposed green products is a marketing tactic and not the real deal. If 
your vendor is comfortable giving you frank answers, you can use those 
responses to determine the credibility of product claims and compare the 
product with others on the market.
 
If you really want to verify the authenticity of green cleaning supplies, look for 
the Green Seal. This certification, provided by the organization of the same 
name, is the stamp of authenticity when it comes to toxin-free cleaning prod-
ucts. All products bearing the Green Seal have been scientifically evaluated 
for their health impacts. Go to www.greenseal.org/findaproduct/
cleaners.cfm to access the organization’s list of certified cleaning products.
Cutting the Carbon Impact 
of Company Travel
Business travel significantly contributes to carbon emissions, so cutting 
down on your business’s carbon impact by revamping your company travel 
policies — including employee commuting — is valuable for profits, people, 
and the planet. After all, global airfare prices are on the rise; so are the costs 
of hotels, restaurants, and rental vehicles.
Companies of all sizes are building up their corporate social responsibility 
efforts by purchasing carbon offsets (which I explain in the “Increasing 
Energy Efficiency” section, earlier in this chapter) to diminish the impact of 
business travel. The investment firm Sustainable Asset Management is work-
ing toward complete elimination of business travel emissions — a fact it’s 
touting on all of its marketing materials! Although that good PR isn’t directly 
measurable, it’s an integral part of the company’s overall green image.

128
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Because carbon offsets cost additional dollars, the financial benefits from 
greening your company’s travel primarily accrue from reduction efforts (for 
instance, engaging in telecommuting or train travel rather than air travel).
I delve into different green travel-related policies you can explore within the 
following sections.
Conferencing electronically 
instead of in person
 
Certainly much can be said about the networking that transpires when 
people physically meet and engage in business transactions and events at a 
personal level. But is this in-person networking necessary every time? Not 
at all. The potential for significantly reducing your office’s carbon footprint 
by using telephone-based and Internet-based conferencing rather than jump-
ing on a plane is significant. If your company is engaged in significant long-
distance air travel (particularly international), it may not take long for you to 
recoup the costs of this additional technology.
If the sale of teleconferencing equipment is any indication (with two large 
suppliers reporting a 40 to 60 percent annual increase in sales), same-time 
communication via phone, audio, or Web conferencing systems is a modality 
that’s becoming a highly accepted alternative to traditional business travel.
Triple-bottom-line benefits of teleconferencing include
 
✓ A reduced environmental footprint: The more meetings you hold by 
phone or Internet, the less people have to hop on a train or plane that emits 
greenhouse gases. The planetary benefits on this one are a no-brainer!
 
✓ Increased productivity from employees: Employees who don’t have to 
spend as much time traveling can spend that newly found time working 
instead.
 
✓ Reduced travel costs: Travel is often cited as one of the top five 
expenses of doing business, depending on your industry sector, size, 
and location. Clearly anything you can do to cut back on this expense is 
a boon on the profit side of your Profit & Loss Statement.
The increased capabilities of Web conferencing, including sharing applica-
tions, VOIP (voice over internet protocol, such as Skype), electronic white-
boards, and text chat for live Q & A sessions has led many companies to 
consider teleconferencing as a green alternative to physical travel.

129
 Chapter 6: Small Steps, Big Change: Office Practices
 
Want to make an impact on your company’s travel policies? Check out the 
costs associated with purchasing the necessary telecommunications equip-
ment and compare that to the associated travel savings. You can then use 
your findings to show that conferencing electronically is a clear triple-bot-
tom-line winner on all counts.
Investing in sustainable company cars
If your company owns or leases a fleet of automobiles (for salespeople or 
for executives), considering a sustainable fleet-replacement policy may be 
important. As these cars come up for replacement, will you purchase more of 
the same, or is it time to rethink the corporate fleet?
 
The real debate is whether making the change from traditional cars to green 
ones is worth the effort. Consider that single-passenger vehicles (particularly 
full-size ones that aren’t fuel efficient) aren’t ecofriendly. Vehicles are esti-
mated to supply 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions that significantly con-
tribute to climate change. In 1950, there were 50 million cars on the road; now, 
more than 700 million dot the globe — a number that’s growing exponentially 
with the increased affluence of citizens in the developing world. According to 
the Earth Island Journal, the world’s car population is increasing five times as 
fast as the human population.
 
To effectively determine whether switching to fuel-efficient company cars is 
right for your business, do some quick math to calculate your potential total 
savings annually.
 
1. Determine the average number of miles your current fleet vehicle gets 
and subtract that from the number of miles per gallon the average 
hybrid car gets.
 
 So if your average fleet vehicle gets 24 miles per gallon and your com-
pany autos travel 30,000 miles per year, how many gallons per year will 
you save if you convert to a hybrid (assuming this vehicle gets 50 miles 
to the gallon)? In this example, you’d save 26 (50 – 24) miles per gallon.
 
2. Divide that total by the total number of miles traveled by all fleet 
vehicles per year and multiply your answer by the average regional 
price for a gallon of gas in your area.
 
 Sticking with the previous example, here’s how the equation would look:
 
 30,000 ÷ 26 = 1,154 Gallons × Average Regional Price for a Gallon of Gas = 
$__________ in Total Annual Savings
 
 Assuming static gas prices, you can then easily calculate how long it will 
take to pay for any sticker-price differential between a hybrid and a tra-
ditional vehicle.

130
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Reducing your company’s carbon footprint is dependent on your staff’s driv-
ing habits, the region where the cars are traveling, and how the vehicles are 
maintained. However, a rough estimate is that one mile driven in an average, 
well-maintained hybrid vehicle emits about one pound of carbon dioxide. So 
not only do you double your efficiency by making the switch to fuel-efficient 
company cars but you also halve your business’s carbon footprint.
Instituting green corporate travel policies
When employees must travel, craft sustainable travel policies to guide them 
when they’re out of the office.
 
✓ Mandate fuel-efficient rentals if car rental is absolutely necessary. 
These vehicles now comprise 50 percent of two major car rental agen-
cies’ rentals. Look for hybrids to join the ranks soon.
 
✓ Prioritize mass transit as the transportation mode of choice in metro 
areas instead of renting individual passenger vehicles. If employees 
are going to a conference, meeting, or event, consider requiring mass 
transit to transport them between the airport or train station and the 
hotel and event location.
 
✓ Require travel by train rather than by plane when feasible. Planes’ 
emissions have a particularly strong impact on climate change due to 
the altitude at which they’re released.
 
✓ Book rooms at hotels that belong to the “Green” Hotels Association 
(or are Green Seal–certified). You can find these hotels at www.green
hotels.com or at www.greenseal.org/programs/lodging.cfm, 
respectively.
 
 On a side note, if you’re planning on holding a conference at a hotel, 
be sure to ask whether it has ecofriendly meeting rooms available. 
Characteristics of ecofriendly meeting spaces include in-room recycling 
bins, compact fluorescent light bulbs, and the use of china and cutlery 
rather than disposable products.

eveloping new products for the green market is an exciting challenge 
for businesses new to sustainability. Designing a product with 
ecoattributes as its driving force will stimulate lots of new discussions about 
your product line. Great products are a result of superior design; extraordi-
nary green products take that stellar design to the next level.
As your organization increases its commitment to sustainability, prodding 
your product design team to transition to sustainably oriented thinking will 
edge its way to the top of your to-do list. Now is a great time to start capitaliz-
ing on green product opportunities while reducing your company’s exposure 
to external threats, such as increased raw material costs and changing mar-
kets, posed by your less-than-sustainable merchandise.
In this chapter, I preview the variety of ways you can green your product 
design practices, explain why greening your product line is an important part 
of your business’s overall sustainability plan, and show you how to make 
changes, from simple yet effective ones to more concerted efforts.

Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Surveying the Three Main Aspects of 
Sustainable Product Development
One of the goals of sustainable product design is to create a comprehensive 
bill of materials through a green lens, which means looking at your products’ 
content by measuring greenhouse gas emissions, recycled content, virgin 
natural resource requirements, water usage, waste produced, packaging per 
unit, and the like. Of course, your suppliers will be assessed in this light as 
well, because most companies rely on other companies to provide input for 
their products and services. You’ll also want to review the effects of the vari-
ous production processes on the triple bottom line (benefits to people, planet, 
and profit, as described in Chapter 1).
Both raw material inputs and production processes used are of grave impor-
tance when looking holistically at sustainable product design. They’re viewed 
as a package rather than independent units because production processes 
rely on the raw materials that constitute the input.
Products
The paramount thing to understand about sustainable product design is that 
it isn’t an add-on concept. Rather, it’s a “be all” strategy. Modifying existing 
products to tack on elements of sustainability is not what the whole idea’s 
about. Truly green products are designed from the get-go with ecological 
sustainability as a driving force. You have to constantly pose questions as 
to how to minimize inputs, reduce reliance on virgin raw materials, decrease 
impact during the period the product is being used, and extend responsibility 
(as the producer) through the item’s end of life. The intent of green design is 
that a product will either be recycled into compostable (biological) nutrients 
or upcycled into another product at the end of its useful life, without any 
harmful waste being generated. (Upcycled refers to using waste material as 
components of new and viable products.)
Developing sustainable products also means giving ongoing attention to 
deleting any harmful items from the bill of materials and keeping an eye out 
for ways to innovate natural products. Just consider the case of a small pet 
care products business that incorporated sustainable thinking into its design 
phase and came up with the idea of using a fuzzy stuffing for its pet beds 
that’s made of recycled plastic soda bottles rather than the synthetic alter-
native. This design consideration not only saves money but it also greatly 
reduces the company’s carbon footprint and diverts hundreds of tons of plas-
tic bottles from landfills. It has also managed to stimulate other ecofriendly 
pet products as well.

133
 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
 
Simply put, sustainable product design looks to minimize raw materials input 
and the processing needed to convert raw materials into a final product. It 
also looks to create products that are less harmful to people and the environ-
ment and can be used for the betterment of society. Ultimately, it envisions 
what the product’s next life will look like.
Consider another example: Rohner Textil AG, a textile mill in the Swiss Alps, 
was formerly under pressure from Swiss regulatory agencies to clean up the 
toxins found in its factory trimmings. The company opted to collaborate with 
DesignTex (a U.S. furniture products operation) in order to analyze all of its 
1,600 dyes for toxic content. By the end of the analysis, only 16 dyes were 
identified as nontoxic; Rohner proceeded to eliminate all the hazardous dyes 
from its inventory. The resulting natural fabric produced by the company has 
earned DesignTex and Rohner many awards, and the water leaving the Swiss 
factory is now actually cleaner than the water entering the plant. Because the 
tailings are now nontoxic, they can be used as a byproduct in other textile 
operations.
 
Putting green product design at the forefront is imperative because it can 
lead to simplification of both inputs needed and processes required. Doing so 
can also save you money and showcase your company as a leader in its field. 
Green product design is manifested through
 
✓ Materials choices: Reducing packaging and virgin raw materials is a key 
consideration, as is having an emphasis on using local products when-
ever possible. Selecting biobased and nontoxic materials in exchange for 
synthetic and hazardous materials is also key. (Many flooring choices, 
such as synthetic carpets and linoleum, have toxic components that as 
a whole can’t be upcycled because the next generation of product won’t 
want to mix toxic and nontoxic materials.)
 
✓ Foregoing unnecessary bells and whistles: Such add-ons require more 
tools, machine calibration, and processing, yet add little real value for 
the end user. It’s best to just cut them out of your design process 
wherever possible.
 
✓ Creating products with longer lives and more adaptability to a wide 
variety of needs: This approach results in a more sustainable manufactur-
ing process, because if your products are more far-reaching in their usabil-
ity and last longer, you can create fewer of them. Patagonia perfected this 
notion in that its products are meant to have very long lives and be layered 
for different levels of activity, without being trendy or mod.
 
✓ How the product’s structure will affect its lifelong sustainability: 
Analysis includes how much energy it will take to get the product in con-
sumers’ hands, how easy replacement parts are to access, how durable 
the prodcut is, and how long its useful life will be. For example, cars 
manufactured on heavy chassis don’t get good mileage throughout their 

134
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
lives —no matter how efficiently the motor functions — because of the 
weight. An Energy Star–rated dishwasher takes just as much raw mate-
rials (casing, sensors, pump, and the like) as a traditional dishwasher, 
but during its life cycle, the true sustainability attribute shines through 
because it uses much less energy and water.
 
 Only products that truly add value to customers’ lives are envisioned in 
the green product design process. Disposable, feel-good-for-a-moment 
items that quickly become obsolete or require an inordinate amount of 
materials or processing are undesirable ideas; discard these concepts 
immediately.
Talk about a leader in green product development: Nike took the lead in sus-
tainable shoe design by challenging its product engineers with some revolu-
tionary design parameters. According to these new mandates, Nike shoes can 
no longer contain PVC or incorporate toxic ingredients in the formulation of 
their rubber shoe soles. The shoes now have to be designed so that they can 
either be recycled or become a new product at their end of life — all without 
losing any element of performance or increasing the shoes’ final price point.
As a result of rethinking product engineering, Nike designed a line of shoes, 
named Considered, that was the first major design of its type to commit to 
water-based adhesives (thereby eliminating volatile organic compounds). 
The company also launched Nike Grind, a program that slices shoes into 
three components at their end of life: rubber, foam, and fabric. All of these 
end-of-life products circle back into production as flooring, baseball fields, 
tennis courts, and padding under hardwood basketball floors.
Processes
Many industrial manufacturing processes aren’t configured to maximize effi-
ciency because they rely on outdated design. Whole industrial parks are now 
designed to employ the concept of closed-loop manufacturing, which creates 
new products from reused materials in perpetuity. With physical proximity of 
raw material production/extraction to the assembly line, transportation costs 
are negligible.
For example, powder coat tailings from an industrial painting process 
can be used as a dye in greeting cards. Fly ash, a byproduct of producing 
coal, is used as a strengthening component in construction-grade cement. 
Spent grain from a brewery provides a growing medium for mushrooms. 
Concurrently, the used mushroom substrate becomes worm fodder, which is 
used to manufacture biodegradable detergents and is also packaged and sold 
in home composting kits.

135
 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
Eliminating or lessening environmental harm
Much of the work being done on sustainable process development revolves 
around reducing energy used (and therefore greenhouse gases emitted) and 
toxins released from a particular course of action. A sustainable manufacturing 
process is one that has maximized energy efficiency through equipment selec-
tion, facilities layout, materials handling systems, and supply chain control.
 
If you use toxic materials in your current production process, eliminating their 
use in future designs is critical. If dangerous materials are part of your indus-
try and natural alternatives aren’t available, you need to consider the safe 
manufacture, transportation, and disposal of them.
Minimizing water and atmospheric pollution is also an important 
consideration — and one that has ongoing regulatory compliance issues for 
most manufacturing entities. Future product and process design discussions 
should consider ways to enhance your company’s opportunity to purify the 
water it uses and cut greenhouse gas emissions through reduced energy usage.
Reducing waste
From a manufacturing standpoint, all waste is an expenditure that adds no 
value and therefore should be eliminated. Clearly, reducing waste has triple-
bottom-line effects because if a particular material isn’t incorporated into the 
next loop of manufacturing, it’s either incinerated or diverted to a landfill. 
Some waste streams (like e-waste, which I cover in Chapter 6) have strident 
impacts on people in other countries (where the process of extracting valu-
able metals occurs in a way that’s harmful to human health.)
Lean manufacturing, or lean production, is a sustainable manufacturing model 
in which sustainable product engineers look at waste elimination when 
analyzing processes. Any use of resources that doesn’t create value for the 
consumer is considered economically and environmentally unsound and is 
automatically a red flag area to target for improvement. Technological capac-
ity is increasing every day, and new materials, coatings, machine-cutting 
tools, and finishing processes are being innovated to focus on waste-
reduction methods as a result.
Increasing resource productivity
In crafting your new product design paradigm, you should analyze every 
input (think energy, water, and raw materials) for the potential to eke more 
productivity out of fewer resources. Fortunately, technology has the capacity 
to increase the utility of natural resources 5, 10, or even 100 times more than 
what it is currently. Advances in refrigeration technology in the last 30 years 
have increased energy efficiency an astounding 98 percent. New lighting 
technology, such as LEDs and compact fluorescent light bulbs, has decreased 
energy usage tremendously in homes, plants, and offices.

136
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
Electric motors are widespread throughout many industry sectors. They move 
materials, power pumps, and energize grinders, compressors, and mills — and 
account for tremendous costs and emissions for lots of companies. By invest-
ing in more efficient motors, or by retrofitting existing ones to decrease 
energy used per unit of output, your company has significant capacity to 
reduce inefficiencies and yield savings.
Ways to envision increasing resource productivity include looking at
 
✓ How much more output can be achieved from one unit of energy: For 
example, a Rocky Mountain microbrewery captures steam emitted from 
the brewing process to heat its building. In the Midwest, pumps in an 
industrial process have been reconfigured to minimize energy usage 
without impacting production quality or quantity.
 
✓ How materials input used can be reduced (which almost always 
reduces energy used as well): The wood products industry offers a stel-
lar example of this consideration thanks to a new honeycomb-type design 
that creates structural support equivalent to that of solid wood, without 
requiring as much virgin material. Also, less energy is needed to transport 
this lighter material. If you require further inspiration, consider how new 
solar technology is poised to manufacture nonsilicon solar panels by 
imprinting a thin layer of microscopic solar cells onto aluminum foil-like 
metal sheets. The result is a lighter weight, more efficient solar panel.
Supply chain
Extended product responsibility is based on the concept that everyone — 
suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers — shares the responsibility for 
reducing the environmental impacts of a product throughout its life cycle. 
As you dial into each of your raw material sources, asking your suppliers 
whether they’re having the same conversations with their product design 
teams is prudent. In many cases, reducing toxins in your final product requires 
in-depth conversations with suppliers about how they’re approaching their 
materials throughout the whole spectrum: manufacture, use, distribution, 
and disposal.
You may be surprised at how many companies (particularly if you source 
from large multinational organizations) are already deep into greening their 
product design. For example, a gigantic chemical company is spending 
millions to research biotechnology alternatives to synthetic chemicals. 
An international furniture company is working as a key member of the 
Sustainable Packaging Coalition to minimize packing materials and use only 
recycled ones.

137
 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
 
Consider requiring your suppliers to judiciously label all materials for 
their recyclability (particularly plastics) so that end users can see how 
components may have different recycling or upcycling capacity. Also, make 
sure your suppliers are forthright as to the content of the raw materials you 
purchase from them.
Recognizing the Value of Sustainable 
Product Development
Nothing speaks more loudly about your company than your product line. 
As more media attention is lavished on products that are adversely affecting 
the planet, as well as on those that are helping to rejuvenate it, more and 
more people will start caring where your company stands on the topic of 
green product development. Depending on where your company is in the 
sustainability-planning process (which I outline in Chapter 4), greening your 
product design efforts will have an effect on public relations, networking 
potential, and new customer growth.
 
Following are the major potential benefits you can accrue by greening your 
product line. Of course, you may not see all of these benefits from each 
product design modification.
 
✓ Reduced expenses: Well-designed products minimize use of raw materi-
als by squeaking out the most productivity possible from each unit of 
input. Modifying your design process so that manufacturing, materials 
movement, storage, and distribution decrease energy usage and either 
minimize or eliminate waste are expense-reducing maneuvers. Waste 
is an unnecessary business expense and a burden on the environment; 
many times it’s also toxic to the community. Reduced waste-disposal 
expenses on one hand and decreased raw material costs on the other 
make zero-waste design a triple-bottom-line winner.
 
 Of course, reduced expenses also add up to increased savings. A stellar 
example of this savings involves Interface Ltd. When the company built 
its factory in Shanghai, China, it was able to reduce a particular indus-
trial process that required 14 pumps. It redesigned the system from 
small pipes and big pumps to big pipes and small pumps, increasing 
energy efficiency by 92 percent and saving tons of capital investment.
 
✓ Additional revenue: Identifying a second-hand use for waste can 
effectively give you another product, possibly generating additional 
revenues. For example, sawdust byproduct from a mill can be used to 
manufacture pressboard, lyocell fabric, and other items, thereby creating 
a second market for what was previously treated as waste.

138
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Business position within green supply chains: Your small or mid-sized 
enterprise may not feel very influential in the larger commercial world 
where the power of your influence seems pretty limited. But consider 
how your products play into the needs of the many large corporations 
that are going green. Look at your key customers and analyze where 
they’re heading. Check out these examples to see what I mean:
 
• When a company such as Ford Motor Company (with more than 
$100 billion in annual purchase orders) announces the greening of 
its supply chain, you can bet tens of thousands of vendors down 
the supply chain are taking notice and reconsidering how they can 
make compliant products.
 
• Seventh Generation assesses its manufacturers’ processes with 
an audit-type tool, giving preference to the organizations that can 
provide sustainable materials and services. This tactic is called 
environmentally preferable purchasing. Determining whether any of 
your key customers are heading toward these policies is definitely 
worthwhile.
 
✓ Expanded customer base and increased customer satisfaction: 
Developing products with a keen eye toward the emerging green market 
offers you tons of creative opportunities because the market for green 
products is exploding. The value of sustainable product/service purchasing 
is estimated at more than $200 billion in the U.S. alone. Yet a 2007 National 
Technology Readiness Survey shows that 42 percent of adults have 
difficulty finding the green products and services that they’re interested 
in buying! That’s a big disparity. (Turn to Chapter 10 for a peek at the 
minds and behaviors of the burgeoning green consumer base.)
 
 Additionally, business value accrues to organizations that employ Cradle 
to Cradle, a high-visibility approach to product design that promotes 
strong customer relationships that arise from superior, safe, and durable 
products that reduce product liability exposure and material input. I go 
into greater detail about this approach later in this chapter.
 
✓ Reduced legal risk: Activist shareholder lawsuits are on the rise. These 
lawsuits center on everything from workers’ rights to product liability 
to environmental degradation and ethics violations. Domini Mutual 
Funds alone has filed more than 140 shareholder resolutions with more 
than 60 corporations. These lawsuits are targeted toward such topics as 
product safety, natural resource protection, and energy conservation. 
Because sustainable product design takes engineers through the pro-
cess of looking at many of these design aspects, it reduces your overall 
legal exposure.
 
 Bottom line: Litigation from hazardous materials (either those materials 
used in production or those created as a byproduct of it) eats up a 
tremendous amount of financial resources. Why waste funds and time 
(and cause yourself a lot of angst in the process) when you can instead 
explore and develop natural alternatives to your components to alleviate 
this concern completely?

139
 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
 
✓ Less negative publicity: News of mistreated employees litigating, haz-
ardous material cleanup efforts gone awry, international labor viola-
tions, or other insidious business transactions can undo the effects of 
positive advertising dollars. Remember how Greenpeace launched a 
mock Apple Web site highlighting egregious amounts of waste associ-
ated with iPod production and packaging? This move created scads of 
negative press for Apple right before the tech giant’s biggest product 
start in years.
Taking Stock of Your Current Product 
Line: Three Approaches
To create energy-efficient, sustainable products, you may need to administer 
a radical dose of rethinking to the design of your product and production 
process. Although sustainable product design aspires to much more than 
bare-bones compliance, approaches to sustainable design can be a good 
jumping-off point for analyzing how your products and processes can not 
only conform but also add value. Luckily, some very well-respected systems 
can guide you in developing innovative new products. The next few sections 
identify some of the approaches you can use when brainstorming ways to 
revamp your product line. They include the following:
 
✓ Life cycle assessment (LCA): LCA refers to the analysis of each phase 
of your product’s life for its environmental load, which means quantify-
ing greenhouse gas emissions, waterborne emissions, solid wastes, raw 
materials, and energy required. This technique can be used to analyze 
existing products and develop new products. Companies like Sony, 
Volvo, and Xerox have been using the LCA approach for years to reduce 
emissions, lower energy requirements, and decrease ecological impact.
 
 LCA is a fairly complex assessment requiring materials or energy spe-
cialists to flesh out where exactly the carbon footprint, for example, 
lies in your production process. If you make postcards for the tourism 
industry, how much carbon is involved in making and transporting the 
paper? Obtaining the photos? Embossing the photos on the paper? 
Transporting the postcards to various shops? Sending the postcard 
(that is, using the product)? Disposing of the product? You get the idea.
 
✓ Cradle to Cradle (C2C) design: This is a product design strategy that 
stretches the innovator to think of the product design system as a whole 
rather than the sum of its parts. It encourages design engineers to pre-
think where the product will end up at the end of its useful life. So many 
products currently on the market are intended to end up in the landfill. 
In this zero-waste model, that thinking becomes obsolete. At the end of 
a product’s life cycle, all of its components have a new life, and no part 
of the product is considered waste. The ultimate goal of the C2C design 
approach is a zero-waste product.

140
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Design for the Environment (DfE): This is an EPA program that works 
with different industry sectors to select technologies, materials, and 
processes that reduce energy used and chemical risk involved. These 
industry sector and government partnerships cover the gamut, from nail 
salons and low-VOC adhesive companies to wire/cable insulation com-
panies and industrial and institutional laundromats.
 
Good design requires thoughtful analysis of a product’s entire life cycle. 
Analyze a product from inception to disposal to see where energy inefficien-
cies exist or where waste is produced and create steps to change the unsus-
tainable practices.
Considering each phase of a product’s life 
cycle: Life cycle assessment (LCA)
The objective of conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA; see the basics 
of this tactic in the preceding section) is to decrease total environmental 
burden by quantitatively determining where the highest-impact improve-
ments on reducing inefficiencies can be found. Conducting an LCA (including 
an analysis of your supply chain) allows you to easily see which areas should 
be addressed first so you can focus on producing the highest results and 
then move progressively through other identified areas to reduce impacts. 
LCA produces a list that quantifies the pollutants at each of the product’s life 
stages, as well as the amount of energy and materials used.
By looking at the life cycle phases of your product when reviewing product 
design, you can easily see which design considerations to prioritize. Stages 
that have the highest negative environmental impact are given priority for 
change and design modifications. For example, say you ship assembled pow-
ertrain units from China to Washington, but you know that shipping them 
from Kentucky to Washington causes fewer atmospheric and waterborne 
emissions. LCA gets you thinking about whether the shipping weight can be 
reduced, whether you can tighten distribution to eliminate such long-
distance shipping requirements, and whether you have any options for 
alternate assembly locations.
Cutting overall emissions, for example, requires identifying carbon dioxide 
equivalent emissions at every stage of a product’s life because looking at one 
total emission number for a unit of product isn’t helpful in assessing where to 
begin decreasing that number. Only when you can see the parts that make up 
the sum can you easily pigeonhole where the highest-impact areas are.
Often the results of your LCA may be surprising: Your product may have 
most of its impact in a stage other than the one you imagined, giving you 
fodder for creative ideas on how to minimize emissions at that stage of the 
life cycle.

141
 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
Conducting the analysis
 
The standard life cycle phases that you should look at are as follows:
 
✓ Extracting or producing the product’s raw materials: This phase takes 
you all the way back to the start of your product’s story. For example, 
if the product in question is a cotton shirt in a typical chain store, your 
company may identify the cotton as having come from Uzbekistan. The 
cotton is a heavily fertilized crop (and the fertilizer contains petroleum, 
so there’s some negative environmental impact there) and has been 
shipped across Asia to a manufacturing plant (again requiring the use 
of fossil fuels, but this time for transportation). There’s also a negative 
impact on the groundwater in the valley in Uzbekistan due to runoff 
from overfertilized soil. Additionally, you have a possible violation of 
workers’ rights laws because children are being employed to harvest the 
cotton.
 
✓ Manufacturing or assembling the product: This phase looks at and doc-
uments the aspects of the processing stage that are potentially harm-
ful to the environment. Say your cotton has arrived in Korea (which 
causes atmospheric pollution because of the fossil fuels used to ship it 
there). The environmental laws in Korea may not require scrubbers on 
the stack that fuels the plant, resulting in significant emissions during 
conversion of the raw materials into the final product. Additionally, 
some toxins are included in the finish that’s applied to the product, and 
they’re packaged in layers of plastic for shipping.
 
✓ Distributing the product: This phase requires reviewing how the prod-
uct is disbursed to its final markets. This distribution may be multistep 
via warehouses, or it may be directly to the end consumer. Because final 
distribution of the cotton shirts is in the U.S. (and therefore rail isn’t an 
option), the shirts are most likely put on container ships that run on 
fossil fuels and have many negative impacts on oceanic health.
 
✓ Using the product: This phase involves determining what the final user 
is intent on doing with the product and what the potential effects of that 
use are on the environment. The cotton shirt may have a life of only two 
years, considering it’s an animal of the fashion world and is designed 
to have a short life. In that time frame, it’ll be washed 40 times, which 
means using water, energy, and detergents that possibly contain phos-
phates (which have negative watershed implications).
 
✓ Disposing of the product: This phase is all about figuring out the envi-
ronmental impact of the product’s end of life process. The shirt may see 
a second life in the rag bag in your consumer’s home, or it may end up in 
a second-hand shop; most likely it’ll go the landfill where it will become 
part of methane emissions.
You should assess each life cycle phase in regard to these three considera-
tions. Note: These categories may be different among companies and may 
pertain regionally to appropriate issues such as smog or water toxicity.

142
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Where the most energy is embodied (and carbon emitted)
 
✓ Where the most waste is expended
 
✓ Where other environmental load may be created
Because LCA is a tool to help decision-makers better understand the full 
impact of a product, you should use it with other decision criteria, such as 
cost, price, and performance, to make the best product development deci-
sions possible.
Comparing results of the analysis
 
After you’ve gathered raw data through your assessment, you may convert it 
to categories that allow comparison between areas of impact. For example, 
the toxic impact of different heavy metals on soil needs to be expressed in 
common terms. Likewise, the effect of all sorts of greenhouse gasses should 
be expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. Although a full-blown LCA can 
be quite complex and costly (and may require the assistance of an external 
expert), application of the principles in the form of a simple chart (for each of 
the five life cycle stages) may easily and graphically illustrate for your man-
agement team which areas of focus will yield the greatest improvement in 
product design.
Even without an LCA expert, a simple compilation of all the information out-
lined in the preceding section provides an overview of where the problem 
areas are, allowing your design team to visualize where its energies should be 
used in order to have the highest impact.
You can also use a chart to gauge products in comparison to one another. 
One of your products may be very energy intensive in the production stage 
but relatively benign in all other stages and get a bad rap simply because pro-
duction is a high-visibility area. When doing LCA, you may find that another 
product that has little waste and relatively light emissions at the production 
stage turns out to have heavy impact on the raw materials extraction stage, a 
fact that doesn’t automatically jump out of corporate data.
Figure 7-1 illustrates each stage of the life cycle of two hypothetical products 
and analyzes current and proposed emissions from both. Notice how this 
chart takes a visual snapshot of the stages of a product’s life and lets design-
ers, managers, suppliers, and employees all easily see where design modifi-
cations should focus as they pertain to carbon dioxide emissions. The same 
sort of analysis can be done for waterborne pollution, heavy metal release, 
and so on.

Rethinking how products are designed: 
Cradle to Cradle (C2C)
To understand William McDonough and Michael Braungart’s Cradle to Cradle 
(C2C) design paradigm, you have to understand that traditional product 
design theory has long relied on a linear, extract-consume-dispose model 
called cradle to grave. This model seemed perfectly acceptable in the 1800s 
and 1900s because raw materials such as minerals, timber, coal, land, wa-
ter, and so on appeared inexhaustible and fossil fuels for processing were 
cheap and readily available. Now, however, many natural resources are limited, 
and the planet is warming, which I explain in more detail in Chapter 2.
Some studies show that 90 percent of all extracted materials go to waste 
in producing durable goods in North America, leaving a scant 10 percent 
for actual consumption. Historically, many companies have even built in 
obsolescence during the product design phase by creating new-generation 
technology that requires upgrading to current models and throwing away the 
old items. Additionally, chemicals used in many household products release 
carcinogenic compounds and weaken human immune systems.

144
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
According to McDonough and Braungart, manufacturers’ response to most 
of these problems has centered on reducing or minimizing the amount of 
pollutants or the impact of the product. McDonough is famously quoted as 
saying “less bad is not good.” Decreasing pollutants, for example, still results 
in pollution.
Instead, McDonough and Braungart suggest that product design as a whole 
must be radically rethought in order to minimize environmental impact 
with a particular eye to what happens at the end of a product’s life cycle. To 
achieve this goal, they recommend segregating a product’s materials into two 
major types: biological and technical nutrients. Biological nutrients decom-
pose organically; technical nutrients, usually synthetics or ores, can be easily 
extracted and become part of a closed-loop manufacturing system. Both 
types of nutrients are used in endless cycles.
Today, the C2C design protocol is being used for everything from packaging 
materials to toys to the reconfiguration of complex integrated manufacturing 
plants. Packaging materials that eliminate all toxins can be endlessly recycled 
and need not ever become part of a landfill. Toys that are made from sustain-
ably harvested wood and painted with biologically based dyes can be cycled 
through a continuous loop. In the context of manufacturing processes, C2C 
gives product design folks an overview of how to configure facilities so that 
waste from one process serves as food (in other words, an input) for another 
while minimizing energy required and retooling machines to work with new 
materials that contain no toxins.
 
Although relatively new on the green scene, C2C is a concept that some very 
old processes are built on. Permaculture, an agricultural method that uses 
shade from one plant to protect another, natural pest control, and sophisti-
cated rotation methods to preserve soil integrity, is a grand example of C2C 
that has worked for centuries. All the end products are endlessly looped 
backed into the next generation of products.
In Europe, many manufacturers are already responsible for what happens at 
the end of their products’ lives. Not so — yet — in the U.S., but stay tuned. 
Chapter 5 addresses the changing regulatory environment in greater detail.
Assessing overall environmental impact: 
Design for the Environment (DfE)
Begun by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Design for 
the Environment (DfE) program is a practical approach to product design 
that looks at decreasing the overall environmental impact of a product 
throughout its life cycle as well as eliminating chemicals as much as possible. 
The EPA uses this program to work with industry sectors to reduce chemical 
exposure risk and improve energy efficiency. Because it is so industry specific, 

145
 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
the practical methods used to decrease environmental impact (primarily 
through reduced emissions) and chemical risk vary by industry.
One DfE program works with detergent manufacturers to reduce the amount 
of unsafe surfactants (nonylphenol ethoxylates) contained in traditional 
detergents. Under the Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative, the EPA recog-
nizes those companies committed to using safe surfactants that are nonpol-
luting (and therefore have minimal impact on groundwater and aquatic life). 
In partnering with the dry cleaning industry, the EPA has helped provoke 
research about natural alternatives to traditional chemicals and encouraged 
folks to share technologies and research progress.
The DfE program offers industry partners access to expertise and research 
models, unique technical tools, and a scientific review team in order to effect 
change in manufacturing processes and products. The program has part-
nered with 200,000 business facilities and more than 2 million workers to 
date. In 2006, the DfE program had successfully reduced the use of persistent 
chemicals by approximately 183 million pounds.
Any product bearing the DfE label, as shown in Figure 7-2, has undergone a 
thorough EPA review and contains only those chemical ingredients that are 
the least problematic in their class.
 
Figure 7-2:

this label.
 
Partnerships with the EPA usually originate through trade associations or a 
coalition of industry leaders, research institutions, universities, and nonprofit 
groups that need technical support for an industry-wide issue that impacts 
human or environmental health. Go to www.epa.gov/oppt/dfe and click 
the Partnership Projects link on the left-hand side to see whether your indus-
try sector currently has a working partnership with the EPA.
 
If your company thinks that the whole industry can benefit from a collabora-
tion with the EPA, gauge the interest of your trade or technical association by 
contacting the officers and putting forth an informal member e-mail survey. If 
member interest seems hopeful, contact the DfE program for information on 
proposing a partnership and submitting a proposal to the governing group of 
your trade association.

Biomimicry: Letting nature stimulate design
Over a decade ago, Janine Benyus (a natural 
sciences writer by trade) proposed bringing 
biologists and ecologists to the table with prod-
uct designers. Why? Because she believed 
that inspiration for creating products and solv-
ing human problems lies in looking deeply at all 
the genius found in the natural world. Product 
designers that subscribe to biomimicry (and 
there are now thousands of them linked through 
The Biomimicry Institute) are coming up with 
amazing ideas based on the study of nature. 
After all, each of today’s living organisms is the 
result of 4 billion years of adaptation!
Biomimicry is a term coined from bios (life) 
and mimesi (imitate), and the concept is gain-
ing international acceptance as a design 
order that studies nature’s best ideas and then 
emulates them. The idea is that for mankind to 
continue to occupy this planet in a sustainable 
manner, people must become more attuned to 
natural processes and use them for bioinspired 
design.
The Biomimicry Institute houses a growing 
database (check it out at www.biomimicry
institute.org/case-studies) of 
more than 2,100 biomimicry-inspired innova-
tions. Choosing just a few to highlight is a chal-
lenge, but here are some of my favorites:
 ✓ Flipper power: The bumps on a hump-
back whale’s flippers allow the creature to 
streamline a tremendous amount of energy. 
This natural feature is thus being incorpo-
rated into the design of fans, propellers, 
and wind turbines to increase aerodynamic 
efficiency.
 ✓ Like a lung: Product engineers are working 
to design filters that eliminate 90 percent 
of carbon dioxide from flue stacks by using 
technology that imitates the human pulmo-
nary process.
 ✓ Quiet like a kingfisher: The bullet train in 
West Japan was designed to reduce noise 
(and electricity usage) by shaping its “nose” 
like a kingfisher’s beak. Nakatsu, the chief 
engineer on the project, was inspired after 
watching a kingfisher dive into the water 
at great speeds and yet create very little 
splash.
 ✓ Weeds and seeds: Velcro was invented 
when a Swiss engineer closely examined 
the burrs sticking to him and his dog after 
a hike in the Alps. After seeing hundreds 
of tiny hooks, he invented the well-known 
hook-and-loop fastening system.
 ✓ Repellants without chemicals: By copying 
the tiny bumps on a lotus leaf’s surface, 
shields applied to paints, glass, and textiles 
reduce the need to use harmful chemi-
cals to keep the surfaces clean. Water is 
repelled so effectively that it pulls attached 
dirt off of these surfaces as it goes.
Worldwide interest in biomimicry is growing, 
and the body of research in bioinspired design is 
likewise expanding. In order to facilitate shared 
research, The Biomimicry Institute is planning a 
portal (which is currently in the prototype phase 
but accessible if you go to www.biomimicry
institute.org and click the Design Portal 
link on the left-hand side) to catalogue how 
nature’s systems meet global design chal-
lenges and allow international collaboration 
to enhance the progress of design work. Keep 
your eye on this site, which is intended to con-
nect people around the world engaged in sus-
tainable design based on biomimicry.

 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
Beginning to Green Your Product Line: 
The First Steps
You may be wondering how you can possibly start redesigning your products
and rethinking your product development process to align with your company’s 
sustainability vision. Think of all steps in the green direction as progress! 
Although reworking your existing product line may not be in the immediate
future, consider a review of what you already have on the market (using 
one of the approaches outlined earlier in this chapter, if appropriate to your 
industry). Also, begin rethinking the design of new products in the pipeline.
 
Involving everyone in your new sustainable product design venture is an 
important part of gaining buy-in. When you sit down to analyze a new or exist-
ing product through a green lens, bringing together customers, distributors, 
employees, and product designers increases creative potential exponentially. 
Consider holding a charrette, a way of getting input on your design process 
from a multitude of stakeholders. Charrettes are usually multiday, beginning 
with a big group meeting and then splitting off into smaller groups for design 
brainstorming. Each subgroup then presents its work to the full group as 
material for future dialogue. Because of the different perspectives brought 
to the table, charrettes are growing in popularity as a way to build synergy 
around green product design.
Of course, any time you facilitate a group, costs are involved for food, rooms, 
and facilitators. If you want to hold a charette, you must budget for it. Because 
the possible benefits of creating new green products are intangible, base the 
costs of your charette on the future benefits that may result from ecoefficiencies 
and enhanced revenue from new products.
 
Your design ambitions must be matched by your demonstrated commitment 
to growing your staff’s capacity to see your product line through new eyes. All 
product design folks know, for example, that matter doesn’t disappear — it 
simply changes form (incinerated waste generates air pollutants; landfill waste 
becomes methane). Unfortunately, in a traditional capitalist system, this trans-
formation is inconsequential. As long as the company isn’t directly respon-
sible for the cost of waste disposal or toxin remediation, those costs aren’t a 
concern when designing new product. Exposing your employees to a new and 
greener way of thinking opens them up to the full life cycle design approach. 
See Chapter 13 for more thorough coverage of training your employees in sus-
tainability and providing incentives for action.
In the following sections, I walk you through the process of gathering and 
brainstorming ideas you can use to enhance the sustainability of your prod-
uct line. I also present the value of crafting new guidelines that challenge 
your product design folks to consider the ecological effects of all aspects of 
product design.

148

Gathering ideas from outside resources
 
Don’t waste time reinventing the wheel or struggling to find resources that are 
already out there. Consider the following organizations as a jumping-off point 
for gathering all kinds of ideas related to implementing sustainable product 
design at your company:
 
✓ The Biomimicry Guild: Closely linked with The Biomimicry Institute, 
the Biomimicry Guild conducts workshops, coordinates research, and 
engages in consulting in order to help product developers figure out 
how to think about design by examining ecosystem models. It offers cor-
porate education with deliverables, including a feasibility analysis and 
implementation plan for companies interested in pursuing bioinspired 
design. Go to www.biomimicryguild.com and click the Services link 
at the top of the page. Then click the Complete List of Services link on 
the left-hand side of the page that follows.
 
✓ Centre for Sustainable Design: An initiative of the University for 
Creative Arts in England, the Centre for Sustainable Design is considered 
an informational clearinghouse. It brings together international research 
on sustainable design in easy-to-read white papers and reports and has 
served as a catalyst for some of western Europe’s finest sustainable 
design work. This organization offers educational materials and online 
networking capability at its Web site, www.cfsd.org.uk.
 
✓ Engineers for a Sustainable World: This organization’s aim is to pro-
mote sustainable thinking in all the young engineers coming of age 
today. This group has a presence on college campuses; it also hosts an 
annual national conference to network engineers who are interested 
in sustainable design. The ESW’s influence can be seen in programs at 
Cornell, the Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Texas, 
and Stanford, to name a few. Visit www.eswusa.org to find out more 
about the ESW.
 
✓ MBDC: This organization, founded by Cradle to Cradle creators William 
McDonough and Michael Braungart, offers workshop training to edu-
cate product design teams and green-minded folks on how to approach 
sustainable design. Get the scoop on these educational opportunities at 
www.mbdc.com/train/index.htm.
 
✓ Specific professional associations: Depending on your particular indus-
try, trade associations can have significant political, regulatory, and 
business power. They can also serve to unite like-minded professionals 
in the field. Associations such as the American Institute of Chemical 
Engineers (AIChE), the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and the 
American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) are involved in edu-
cation and outreach to their members in the form of virtual seminars 
and networking opportunities regarding sustainable product design 
efforts. Look for similar movements within your own industry niche.

149
 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
 
✓ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: The EPA annually sponsors 
a National Sustainable Design Expo to showcase work done by student 
groups at universities across the U.S. These student groups partner with 
government, private agencies, and nonprofits to facilitate their research.

Establishing new green guidelines 
for product design
Establishing additional or new guidelines for designers to consider can help 
jump-start a green product design process. In addition to existing product design 
standards, think about what new guidelines you may want to give your engineers 
or suppliers to work with. The first section in this chapter, “Surveying the Three 
Main Aspects of Sustainable Product Development,” provides several guidelines 
to get you started. Essentially, you should challenge your in-house engineers or 
parts suppliers to minimize waste, reduce energy, reduce water, and consider 
nontoxic materials. Your company may already incorporate industrial engineer-
ing techniques, inventory systems, or business-efficiency theories (such as 
Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, or Just in Time) that already contribute to 
reduced environmental impact by increasing production efficiency. If so, seeing 
the fit between continuous improvement inherent in these models and designing 
green products is quite easy.
 
Including new design parameters in your company’s research and develop-
ment process doesn’t happen overnight. Your design team is going to need 
training opportunities and the ability to network with other product designers 
who are working through the same issues, so see Chapter 13 for the scoop on 
HR’s role in designing sustainability-oriented training sessions.
 
Above all, foster a can-do attitude. Your company absolutely must encourage 
and reward innovative, out-of-the-box thinking to help your product design 
team transition to sustainability. So many folks seem quicker to toss out a hun-
dred reasons why something can’t be done differently than to identify the one 
way change can actually happen. Seek out sustainably minded thinkers within 
your organization and benefit from their ecopassion and ecoknowledge. (Turn 
to Chapter 3 for tips on identifying these thinkers within your company.)
Brainstorming ideas
As you brainstorm ideas for greening your product development process, 
let your new quality and sustainability parameters guide your thinking in 
ways that may have not been on the table before. Try using your new model 
as the driving force behind your product design team’s strategy session for 

150
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
your next project and see what comes out of it. Let your designers explore 
out-of-the-box ideas and see what sorts of new discussions arise. Envisioning 
the future doesn’t mean all proposed ideas are realistic today, but it does 
encourage product developers to dream about what a perfect product looks 
like to them.
How about posing queries such as the following to help get those creative 
juices flowing?
 
✓ How can we minimize waste at every stage? Finding uses for manufac-
turing byproducts is a great way to reduce waste. Think about where 
your waste may be useful. Can it be used to create energy or serve as 
a raw material input to another process? Can a product design or pro-
cess be slightly changed to make previously unusable waste ready for 
a future life? For example, a dairy farm in western Montana installed 
two 30,000-gallon anaerobic digester tanks to create its own energy. 
Additionally, the digested outputs are nitrogen-rich and sold as soil 
amendments. Quite a story for manure!
 
 When considering ways to cut down on waste, consider reducing or 
eliminating your product packaging. Either move is a great way to cut 
down on your company’s waste. And don’t forget about the resources 
and research available when you become a member of the Sustainable 
Packaging Coalition (see www.sustainablepackaging.org).
 
✓ Can we explore new materials, particularly recycled or post-consumer 
waste materials? If so, by what percentage? This is an important 
question to put out there because closed-loop manufacturing (a core 
component of sustainable product design) is all about using recycled 
and reclaimed raw materials rather than virgin materials and feeding 
the product in question into another cycle at its end of life. Continuous 
recycling of materials is the goal. Responding to growth in the natural 
lawn and garden market, TerraCycle sells plant food composed of worm 
detritus. The product is packaged in reused plastic bottles and shipped 
in boxes that other companies would chuck out.
 
✓ Are the technical and biological nutrients easily separable? As 
explained in the earlier “Rethinking how products are designed: Cradle 
to Cradle (C2C)” section, considering a product’s end of life is critical, 
and the need to easily separate components for their next lives is a core 
concept of extended product responsibility and C2C thinking. Can you 
easily distinguish the biological and technical components in your prod-
ucts? How might you look at your design process if you knew you had to 
segregate out these two elements at the end of life?
 
✓ Is our product easy to disassemble and therefore able to serve as a 
component for another like-kind product or the next generation of a 
similar product? An office chair constructed of natural fibers and fillers 
that are grafted to postindustrial steel tubing can easily be disassembled 
at life’s end because of the attachment choices made in the design 
phases (the natural coverings attach to the steel tubing with a snap 

151
 Chapter 7: Lean Green Product Development Machine
system). At end of life, the natural fabrics are detached and sent to the 
compost bin, and the steel tubing is reused for the next generation of 
office furniture.
 
 Don’t forget about hazardous waste and e-waste issues. Think of ways to 
mitigate hazardous waste issues by using more natural alternatives and 
consider the recyclability of any electronics you use and/or produce. 
Disposing of hazardous waste is incredibly expensive, and eliminating 
this step will almost always decrease costs for your company.
 
✓ Can we cut greenhouse gas emissions as part of the manufacturing 
process? Decreasing energy used is obviously very important. Consider 
ways your company can decrease weight for shipping purposes and 
think about where you can decrease the need for heating, cooling, 
machining, and the like. Also look at whether you have the capability 
to generate renewable energy in order to decrease your reliance on 
fossil fuels. For example, a Rocky Mountain brewery uses 100-percent 
wind power to run its operations. It analyzed the difference in carbon 
dioxide emissions between using wind power and capturing and reusing 
heat generated via its fermentation process and found that wind had six 
times the capacity to reduce emissions than the recycled heat did.
 
✓ How can we minimize transportation costs? Exploring whether oppor-
tunities exist to source alternative raw materials closer to your area is 
well worth it. You can also look at the other side of the equation and 
determine that distributing final products to far-away places isn’t desir-
able and thus step up your efforts to develop regional markets, acknowl-
edging that serving customers across the globe will become increasingly 
more expensive as energy prices continue to rise. Or you may address 
materials handling and find that processing your product in stages at 
different locations is unwise from a transportation standpoint.
 
✓ Which of our vendors may be willing to partner with us in innovative 
ways? Explore whether there are any ways that existing vendors might 
increase their market share by filling your company’s green needs. 
For example, your local telecommunications co-op may find that your 
commitment to reducing corporate travel (see Chapter 6 for more on 
greening this particular office practice) generates a need for video con-
ferencing. Consequently, your vendor decides that interactive video 
applications will be growing as more companies cut air travel and their 
product line development focuses on video conferencing.
 
✓ Do our current products and processes put us at risk legally? 
Prethinking and rethinking how you create products that are environ-
mentally and socially regenerative keeps bad press off your back and 
can in fact lead to really positive press if you’re truly visionary. So 
perform a critical review of potential legal issues and make any neces-
sary changes to avoid getting into potential hot water. Note: This is 
particularly pertinent to producers that handle toxic materials, dispose 
of hazardous waste, engage in production processes that may impact 
water and air pollution, and use subcontractors that operate in foreign 
countries with potential human rights issues.

152
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
 You may own or manage a small, privately owned company and not feel 
exposed to legal risks related to the environmental and social impacts of 
your products, but take a peek up your supply chain. Who do you design 
products for, and do they have any big potential problems on the horizon?
 
 For example, if you’re involved in supplying catalogue copy or doing 
graphic design work for one of the companies targeted by the Forest 
Ethic’s campaign to cut virgin timber used for catalogues, your business 
may be imperiled. Home Depot’s wood suppliers felt the pressure when 
the chain store was targeted by the Rainforest Alliance to remove wood 
products that were unsustainably harvested. Often the ramifications of 
this type of pressure for the supply chain can be very broad in scope.
 
 On the flip side, an eye toward reducing litigation exposure may lead 
you to fall into obvious new sustainable product lines. NaturaLawn, 
founded by one of the old field managers for Chemlawn, capitalizes on 
customers’ desires to eliminate pesticides from their lawns and has 
more than 50,000 clients in 25 states.

T
he intense interest surrounding green construction arguably gives it one 
of the highest profiles of all green business initiatives. Whether you’re 
considering upgrading minor aspects of your facility to green what you have, 
remodeling your existing space, or building a brand-new sustainable facility, 
this chapter gives you what you need. It presents the various aspects you 
must consider, from the systems you can target and professionals you need 
to involve to the factors that determine how extensive your changes are — 
and then some! (If concern about financial resources immediately springs to 
mind, head to Chapter 9, where I provide coverage on accessing ecocapital 
for sustainability efforts.) First, however, I expound on the myriad benefits of 
greening your facility.
Why Greening Your Facility 
Is a Good Idea
With natural capital (water, mineral, soils, and the like) depleting rapidly, and 
the availability of future nonrenewable energy very much up in the air (no 
pun intended), the need to include sustainable facilities design in your over-
all green business plan has never been stronger. Consider these facts:

154
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ The life cycle of a building (construction, operation, renovation, and 
deconstruction) is responsible for 45 percent of the world’s carbon 
dioxide emissions — believe it or not, that’s more than automobiles!
 
✓ Buildings use around 15 percent of the annual global water supply.
 
✓ Construction waste makes up 40 percent of landfill space, and a quarter 
of the globe’s virgin wood goes to fuel the world’s construction industry.
 
✓ A shocking 60 percent of the United States’ electricity consumption 
occurs in commercial buildings.
The biggest argument for greening your building, quite simply, is that you 
can’t afford not to! When you consider how long you plan on being in your 
commercial office space, distribution center, or manufacturing plant, you 
can see pretty quickly that occupying a high-performing space that generates 
annual savings on energy, waste, and water will result in substantial savings 
over the next 75 to 100 years.
On the present-day end of the spectrum, productivity and performance stud-
ies show an increase in employee output and satisfaction among individuals 
who work in a sustainable facility. Additionally, a green building (depending 
on its particular features) yields immediate reductions in operating costs 
through savings in water, energy, and waste disposal bills. Green buildings 
retain their asset value much more than their inefficient counterparts do.
Furthermore, depending on location, structure, and other variables, green 
buildings can be up to 30 percent more energy efficient, on average, than 
traditional buildings. If your current utility charges are 8 cents per kilowatt 
hour, simply reducing energy consumption by 30 percent knocks your costs 
down to 30 cents per square foot per year. Now that packs a punch for the ol’ 
corporate pocketbook!
The advantages of green buildings include
 
✓ An excellent return on your investment: Depending on your building’s 
original costs, utility infrastructure, and location, the payback period (how 
long it takes you to recoup your additional investment with the dollars 
you’ve saved through ownership and maintenance costs) required to 
retrofit old buildings or construct new ones can run from one to seven 
years. After the payback period, you can enjoy some green gravy!
 
✓ Enhanced employee health, happiness, and productivity: Because green 
buildings employ natural daylighting, employee morale is improved and 
absenteeism is reduced. Additionally, the increased indoor air quality 
found in green buildings and the decreased eye strain associated with 
natural lighting contribute dramatically to enhanced employee 
productivity. Extracting data on the correlation between employee health 
and sustainable buildings is difficult, but literally hundreds of articles 
and reports have found a lower rate of illness (particularly fewer cases of 
respiratory sickness, allergies, and asthma) in green buildings.

155
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
 
✓ An opportunity to certify your green efforts and garner recognition 
from environmental leaders: If you want to get some free public-
ity and credit for your company’s sustainable facility, and show your 
stakeholders that your company practices what it preaches, acquiring 
official green-building certification is invaluable. Not only can individual 
components of your green building be certified as sustainable (wood, 
adhesives, wall coverings, paints, and carpets, to name a few) but also 
the entire building can be accredited by the U.S. Green Building Council 
as a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design structure — more 
commonly known as a LEED building. More and more people are growing 
familiar with this terminology as cities and universities in the U.S. and 
Canada start adopting green-building requirements as the norm for their 
facilities. (I delve into the details of certification in this chapter’s “LEED-
certification specifics” sidebar.)
 
✓ Piqued stakeholder interest and increased stakeholder respect: News 
of a glistening new headquarters or renovated production facility is sure 
to arouse the curiosity of your stakeholders. In fact, many businesses 
with LEED-certified buildings, including banks, production facilities, and 
retail outlets, report that leading tours of their sustainable buildings is 
practically a full-time job. Not a bad way to get customers, investors, 
and other stakeholders in the door to educate them about your com-
pany’s green vision, huh?
 
 As consumers become more knowledgeable about green living and busi-
ness, their attention increasingly turns to trading with and investing in 
businesses that are recognized for their sustainable facilities. Perhaps 
that’s because green buildings help stakeholders feel good about a com-
pany’s commitment to corporate social responsibility. Regardless, inves-
tors are increasingly assessing companies based on their preparedness 
for the future and are clearly interested in how they’re mitigating expo-
sure to energy volatility. Green construction is such a compelling part 
of the solution to many of the crises facing the global community today 
(and has so much media exposure) that it’s an easily understandable 
way to showcase your sustainability efforts to stakeholders.
Making Preliminary Decisions
If your company’s green business initiatives include improving the perfor-
mance of your facilities, you essentially have three options: make greener 
choices with what you have, renovate certain areas or systems in your 
building, or build a new facility altogether. In Chapter 6, I present options 
for greening your office practices and instituting other small-scale changes, 
like incorporating energy-efficient lighting fixtures. Here, I help you decide 
whether renovating your current facility or building a brand-new one is in 
your company’s best interests.

156
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Another decision you have to make is whether you want to certify your new 
or renovated facility as a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) building. This certification is a widely recognizable stamp of authen-
ticity that your company is the real green deal and not simply engaged in 
greenwashing (stating that your business is green without taking the actions 
necessary to back up that statement).
To renovate, or to build?
Analyzing whether to engage in one or more green renovation projects on 
your existing structure(s) or to jump into the fire with both feet and build a 
new facility requires an understanding of what’s really involved in a remodel 
or new building project.
 
Remodeling requires fewer materials and therefore produces a lighter carbon 
footprint than new construction (although deconstruction waste can be signif-
icant). Remodeling thus allows you to incrementally green your current busi-
ness abode by analyzing its performance and identifying projects within your 
scope. Stringing projects together year after year may be a perfectly viable 
alternative to building a brand-new structure.
If you do decide to build a new green facility, whether it be a coffee shop on 
a walking mall or a mid-sized dental instrumentation production facility, it’ll 
be a significant effort for your company. Your image is reflected in your new 
building, and the time and financial commitment inherent in this process 
goes without saying. Among other factors, you must consider cost, busi-
ness interruption, and the chaos of construction, not to mention a plethora 
of choices: building materials, site selection, energy and water efficiencies, 
waste reduction, and indoor air quality.
In green construction, the costs of a facility’s entire life cycle are weighed 
against the upfront capital outlay necessary to get the project started. Green 
construction decreases ownership and maintenance costs over a building’s 
life. So although the initial costs of building or remodeling sustainably may 
be higher, these costs are recouped (and often quickly!), which provides a 
triple-bottom-line win for people, planet, and profit. How so? Not only are 
your total ownership and maintenance costs decreased but also your busi-
ness gets to leave a lighter carbon footprint, and your employees get to work 
in an environment that sports high indoor air quality and natural daylighting.
 
After you’ve looked at all the angles affecting your decision (both internal and 
external, as explained in the following sections), communicate your decision 
to renovate or build adequately to all of your stakeholders. Don’t forget inves-
tors, employees, customers, and community members.

157
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
Assessing your internal capabilities
Environmentally sound design requires thinking in broad brush strokes about 
what it is you’re designing and how that fits into your long-term, strategic 
green plan. Designing a green building thus means thinking upfront about 
materials, natural resources usage, site selection, and the handling of waste.
 
In order to effectively evaluate your internal capabilities to determine 
whether renovating or building makes the most sense, you need to revisit 
your long-term business plan and thoroughly analyze the performance of your 
current facility.
 
Also, try taking a stab at answering these questions, being careful to work 
from the top of the list (the most important questions) on down:
 
✓ How is your building’s current performance? Do you have any impend-
ing issues like major structural deficiencies, hazardous material problems, 
or environmental remediation that need to be addressed? If so, you may 
be better off starting from scratch with a new green facility than trying to 
remediate these problems to make them code-worthy and sustainable.
 
✓ What does your forecasted growth look like? If you have aggressive 
growth plans for your company, retrofitting your existing building to 
incorporate green features may not be worth the investment if you’re 
poised to outgrow it within ten years. On the other hand, if you can 
accommodate moderate growth by renovating and adding on to an existing 
structure, your costs and carbon footprint will be less to stay in the 
current building If you’re unsure about what your projected growth looks 
like, revisit your business plan to concoct solid forecasts before moving on.
 
✓ What are your future plans regarding the sales potential of the business 
itself? If your goal is to turn the business over to new owners within five 
to seven years, you may not recoup the front-loaded costs of a new green 
building. You may, however, easily see a return on green remodeling 
endeavors.
 
✓ What will the impact on your cash flow be? Specifically, you should 
consider how likely you’d be able to make debt payments for either type 
of project — a renovation or a new facility. Have your accountant run 
some rough numbers based on rudimentary projections. This approach 
gives you an idea what your payments may be based on loan length, 
project cost, and interest rates.
 
 Energy systems in new construction are obviously of paramount interest. 
Both wind and solar energy, for example, have come down significantly in 
price in the last few years, and many people project the price will continue 
to decline — so these two options are good ones to consider. If you decide 
to revamp your energy sources, though, make sure to compare costs 
per kilowatt hour (multiplied by your new building’s estimated monthly 
requirements) against the price differential for installing the different 
options.

158
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Are any loan or grant programs available to subsidize your green-
building costs? The Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 
provides the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) with funds 
designated to help small businesses purchase renewable energy systems. 
Contact your state SBA branch for more info. Also, a growing number of 
states are implementing grant and loan programs for sustainable 
commercial building features. Use the Internet search engine of your 
choice and type in your state’s name and “loans grants green commercial 
building” to see what’s available in your area. Each program is different, 
so make sure to ascertain whether grant money is attainable for new 
construction and/or renovations.
 
✓ What will your workforce look like in the future? Do you need to build 
more office space, or should you invite discussion about alternative 
employment models? (See Chapter 13 for details on these models, such 
as telecommuting.) If you foresee a shift away from 8-to-5 workers, you 
may not want all that extra workspace down the road, making renova-
tion a more desirable option. Try to find out what digital capabilities 
exist for workers in your industry sector.
 
✓ Are there any areas of concern specific to your business? Making the 
decision to move your business to a new facility has some pretty exten-
sive costs associated with it, particularly depending on the number 
of people you employ. If your business involves a couple of CPAs and 
paraprofessionals who rely on computers to perform their daily tasks, 
moving them is more cost efficient than moving a manufacturing facility, 
for example.
 
 Don’t forget to factor in the costs of moving the physical contents of 
your building when you’re making this very important decision, as 
well as how long your business will be interrupted during the move or 
remodel. Lost revenue from days of downtime during the renovation 
or construction process should be clearly calculated into the project’s 
total cost.
If you’ve been playing with the idea of new construction for a while, you may 
feel overwhelmed with all the information bombarding you about building 
green. If your organization is making the transition to a sustainable business 
model and you feel like you only have so much cash to invest in ecoendeav-
ors at this time, you may want to consider the following: The true principles 
of sustainability aren’t about buying the newest hot technology or having the 
flashiest facility; they’re about doing more with less and conserving wherever 
possible.
 
Don’t feel pressured into investing in a new green building to meet your mis-
sion of being a sustainable business — that may be an oxymoron! Many exist-
ing structures have tons of potential with well-thought-out remodels. You can 
be just as sustainable if you remodel the right way, plus you’ll have spent less 
money (leaving more money to invest in other areas of your business) and 
used fewer raw materials and natural resources.

159
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
Considering external factors that affect your decisions
As you debate the value of renovating or constructing a new green facility, 
you need to have a big picture of the opportunities, resource availability, and 
threats that may impact your decision. Primary factors to look at, from most 
important on down, include
 
✓ Your location: The location of your facility affects both the availability 
and effectiveness of the various sustainability options you have to work 
with. For example, in regard to renewable energy, a lot of neat technol-
ogy is in the works, but storage and distribution issues make much of it 
unavailable in many areas. Also, some types of renewable energy work 
better in certain geographical areas than others. For instance, solar 
power is most effective in the southwestern U.S., and hydropower is 
only available around dams. If your current building isn’t situated to 
tap into passive solar energy and that’s a viable method in your area, 
that may be a strike against renovating if solar energy is the wave of the 
energy future.
 
✓ Your city’s master planning initiatives: What kinds of transporta-
tion plans are in the works, where are the majority of your employees 
coming from, and what sorts of zoning ordinances are on the table? 
The answers to these questions may very well affect your renovation or 
construction plans. Availability of alternative transportation and access 
to raw materials and distribution channels (if applicable) are important 
considerations as well when deciding whether you should rebuild. If 
you’re guaranteed access to sustainable transportation where you’re at 
now, you may want to stay put. If, however, that’s an issue for you cur-
rently and your region’s master plan contains caveats that may enhance 
access for you if you relocate your operation, then constructing a new, 
sustainable facility in a different location may be a better plan.
 
✓ Tax credit availability: Research available property and income tax 
incentives for building green in your area. Make sure to look at state, 
county, and city possibilities. Some tax credits exist for renovation 
efforts as well, so make sure to compare them in your particular state.
 
✓ Plans for new industrial or business parks, green or otherwise: If your 
business can be a part of a planned green neighborhood that’s zoned for 
multiuse, or if it can be considered as the anchor in a new green shop-
ping area, now may be a good time to seriously look at the opportunity 
to build a green facility.
 
✓ What sorts of business models might be incorporated into future 
plans: If you’re in the business of selling retail products or services, 
think about whether putting up brick-and-mortar storefronts is an 
absolute necessity. Other sales strategies, such as Internet or catalogue 
sales, may be more sustainable. (And even if you don’t necessarily want 
to be Internet-based, the market you’re in may drive you that direction.) 
If you go with either of these strategies, renovating your current space 
rather than building and maintaining new square footage may be wise.

160
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Potential resale value: Future real estate market considerations are 
always important, whether you want to renovate or build new. Think 
about whether the area you’re currently in is on its way out of popular-
ity or whether it’s coming into its own because of its proximity to the 
city’s new light rail system. The answer may help drive your decision to 
green your existing facility or look for a new location that’s more in line 
with your sustainable vision.
 
If your business has geographically scattered buildings, factor increasing fuel 
costs into your future strategy. Businesses strewn over multiple locales must 
analyze the movement of people and products between facilities. New green 
distribution centers and warehouses may reduce operational costs, but they 
won’t cut your exposure to volatile fossil fuel costs.
LEED-certification specifics
The LEED rating system has evolved at a very 
rapid pace to feature new categories for dif-
ferent types of green construction projects. 
Currently, the available certification options 
include
 ✓ LEED-CI (for commercial interiors)
 ✓ LEED-CS (for core and shell)
 ✓ LEED-EB (for existing buildings)
 ✓ LEED-H (for homes)
 ✓ LEED-NC (for new construction and major 
renovation)
 ✓ LEED-ND (for neighborhood development)
 ✓ LEED-R (for retail)
The U.S. Green Building Council determines 
a project’s LEED-certification status level by 
dividing attainable points into six categories. 
There are various options for attaining points 
within each of these categories:
 ✓ Sustainable siting
 ✓ Water conservation
 ✓ Energy and atmosphere
 ✓ Materials and resources
 ✓ Indoor environmental quality
 ✓ Green design innovation
The number of points earned per category on 
a project drives the level of certification your 
project receives. (To see a full list of how points 
can be gained in each category, go to www.
usgbc.org.) Based on the points you attain, 
your building may be recognized as one of the 
following:
 ✓ LEED Certified
 ✓ LEED Silver
 ✓ LEED Gold
 ✓ LEED Platinum
If the LEED-certification waters still seem 
murky, know that you can get help from a 
LEED Accredited Professional (AP). LEED APs 
have undergone rigorous testing on sustain-
able design and construction and understand 
the LEED rating system. To see a list of APs, 
visit www.gbci.org and click the LEED AP 
Directory link at the top of the page.
Hot off the press: Tweaks to LEED certification 
for 2009 involve a point system that reflects 
regional differences, such as drought, which 
helps to address one of the main points of con-
cern from the green-building community.

161
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
To certify, or not to certify?
Although green-building certification programs are popping up all over the 
place, LEED is by far the most widely recognized one in the U.S. In Canada, 
the same may be said for Green Globes. Pursuing LEED certification is some-
thing you should think about carefully in advance of deciding whether to ren-
ovate your existing facility or construct a new green one. Because you want a 
specialist in all LEED plans from the get-go, and because certification can add 
costs, the decision to pursue LEED certification must be a consideration from 
the beginning.
Strategically, LEED certification means your facility gets listed on a national 
registry of all LEED-certified buildings. For your efforts and expenses, 
you receive a plaque bearing the LEED logo, as well as free publicity and 
increased respect from your green-minded stakeholders. Also, by inviting 
the U.S. Green Building Council (which provides the stamp of approval on all 
LEED certifications) in to certify your efforts, public perception is that your 
commitment to transparency will carry over to other facets of your operations.
 
Note that pursuing LEED certification is a financial decision as well as a 
strategic one. Aside from standardized costs, such as registering a project, 
the price of obtaining certification varies according to the various types of 
LEED-certifiable construction projects (described in the nearby sidebar). 
Because some of the costs necessary to attain the higher levels of certification 
are a bit exorbitant (and are mostly associated with jumping through paper-
work hoops like a trained terrier), some companies are opting to simply 
construct their buildings according to LEED guidelines and not spend the 
money for certification.
 
So is going for LEED-certified status worth it for you and your company? Ask 
yourself the following:
 
✓ What percentage of your total budget is applicable to the LEED-
certification process? For example, $15,000 may seem like a daunting 
figure, but it may be only 2 percent of your project’s total cost. When 
expressed as a percentage, this certification cost may appear less 
fearsome.
 
✓ What will a LEED-registered project do for your mortgage-negotiation 
capabilities? Chapter 9 pursues this question in more depth, but con-
sider that many lenders view a LEED-certified building as a less-risky 
investment and may be amenable to negotiating based on that.
 
✓ How much free publicity might LEED certification garner for your 
organization? In my community, two financial institutions almost 
simultaneously announced that they were pursuing LEED projects. I 
can’t even begin to tell you the number of articles, awards, and accolades 
these companies have accrued based on their projects. Always factor 
in the value of free press when considering the cost of pursuing LEED 
certification.

162
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ What sort of increased value might LEED certification add to your 
building? Because LEED is a widely recognized certification system that 
identifies your building as energy, water, and waste efficient, consider 
how your facility’s future fair market value may be impacted by the 
rising costs associated with energy and other natural resources.
Surveying Your Options: Specifics 
You Can Target
If you’re like most businesspeople, when you begin strategizing ways to make 
your facility (or parts of it) sustainable, you’re not quite sure where to begin. 
The next few sections give you an overview of the five defining characteristics 
of green buildings: sustainable materials, water conservation, energy 
conservation, renewable energy sourcing, and enhanced indoor air quality. 
Which characteristic(s) you pick depends on your overall goals and the 
resources you have available. I help you make decisions in light of those 
factors earlier in this chapter (see the “Making Preliminary Decisions” 
section); here, I simply lay out your options.
Waste reduction is, of course, a very important component of constructing 
and running a green building, but I cover it in Chapter 6. There, I explain how 
to reduce solid waste in an office space, as well as how to design and where 
to locate in-house recycling centers to handle appropriate recyclable materials 
within your facility. When it comes to construction waste, reducing waste 
on-site is primarily achieved by employing a construction-site recycling firm 
to reuse and recycle construction and demolition debris.
Choosing sustainable materials
Before you can start renovating or building, you must first identify which 
characteristics from the following list are most important to you when 
selecting sustainable materials:
 
✓ Harvested or manufactured locally
 
✓ Sustainably grown or harvested
 
✓ Nontoxic and natural
 
✓ High recycled content
 
✓ Easily recycled at its end of life
 
✓ Low or no ongoing maintenance

163
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
 
Sometimes you can only afford to focus on one characteristic, so you need to 
have an idea of what’s available, what your contractor knows how to work 
with and find, your budget, and your aesthetic goals before you really start 
researching materials.
The vast array of green building materials coming onto the market daily 
makes any attempt at listing them grossly incomplete. However, there are 
some big-ticket items in your building that should be addressed:
 
✓ Framing: Depending on your particular project, you may be choosing 
between steel, engineered lumber, and traditional wood framing. Each 
of these materials has different environmental considerations and long-
term impact on your building’s operations and maintenance. For exam-
ple, steel is extremely energy intensive to manufacture, but is very easy 
to recycle. Wood comes from trees, and you want to keep trees standing 
because they’re carbon eaters.
 
 If you do go with solid wood, make sure it’s certified by the Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC), an international agency that independently 
certifies forest products as harvested from sustainably managed for-
ests. Go to www.fsc.org to see the particulars of FSC-certified wood 
and look for the seal shown in Figure 8-1 on all of your wood products, 
including framing lumber, trim, and plywood.

✓ Roofing: Your choice of roofing can have a strong impact on the overall 
energy efficiency of your building. Dark roofs absorb and emanate much 
more heat than their light-colored counterparts, greatly increasing cool-
ing costs for your building. When identifying roofing possibilities, con-
sider high recycled content, recycled rubber shingles, spray-on foam, 
and solar shingles.
 
✓ Walls: Consider using either 100-percent recycled gypsum or recycled-
content drywall paper for your walls. Structured Insulated Panels (SIPs) 
are another option. These panels come to a worksite precut; are highly 
durable; won’t crack, buckle, or warp; and contain an expanded core of 

164
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
insulation bound on both sides by oriented strand board or plywood 
“skins.” Make sure that the SIP you select uses formaldehyde-free foam 
insulation cores.
 
✓ Insulation: A key component of an energy-efficient building is 
insulation — and a ton of it. Many new types of formaldehyde-free and 
recycled-content insulation are out there (including shredded blue 
jeans, recycled newspaper, cellulose, and recycled cotton), so check out 
commercial-grade green insulation materials.
 
✓ Flooring: Toss away the notion that your facility’s floor needs to look 
like all other commercial facilities’ floors. Based on your business’s 
specific needs, you can choose your flooring from a multitude of options 
that include reclaimed wood, bamboo, cork, PVC-free carpet tiles, and 
colored concrete.
Conserving water
Water conservation in and around your building is of paramount concern. 
Most outdoor water planning issues have to do with maintaining your 
commercial landscaping and managing stormwater. Inside your facility, you’ll 
be most concerned with designing your internal plumbing, fixtures, and 
water-transfer system.
You may not have the funds or desire to incorporate all of the following 
water-conservation methods, but at least consider which one(s) might 
benefit your business the most:
 
✓ Water-conserving plumbing fixtures: Certain plumbing fixtures can 
conserve as much as 50 percent of water used for that particular feature. 
For example, dual-flush toilets allow you to control the water that 
flushes out of and into your tank to limit needless water use. Low-flow 
faucets or shower heads (if you have an in-house gym or showering 
facility) are also important contributors to lowering water usage.
 
✓ Water-efficient landscaping: Native landscaping reduces the need for 
energy- and water-intensive sprinkler systems. Landscaping for outdoor 
buildings should emphasize water-efficient plants, trees, and shrubs. 
Turf should only be used where absolutely necessary (such as in a play 
area for an on-site day care). If you must water turf, make sure to do so 
at night, when evaporation potential is low.
 
✓ A used-water recycling system: A variety of methods are out there for 
collecting and purifying used water from commercial buildings (but not 
from toilets or cafeterias). These various systems recycle the used water 
for flushing toilets, running appliances, watering landscaping, or main-
taining production processes.
 
 Commonly referred to as living machines, hydroponic ponds are systems 
that recycle graywater (used water from restroom sinks and showers, for 

165
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
example) and process stormwater runoff polluted by pesticides, petro-
leum residues, and other toxins. Through a series of ponds, bacteria, 
snails, and plants act like a natural wetland to cleanse and recycle these 
waters into clean liquid. Not only is a hydroponic pond incredibly water 
efficient but it’s also aesthetically beautiful. It can be built outdoors 
in warmer climates and in a greenhouse in colder areas. (As an added 
bonus, the interest level in and free press generated by hydroponic 
ponds is extraordinarily high.)
 
✓ Rainwater harvesting: By combining roof and gutter design with cis-
terns to harvest and store rainwater, April showers can be used in and 
around commercial buildings. Recycled rainwater can be used for func-
tions such as watering landscaping and flushing toilets.
 
✓ A water-conserving procurement policy: This is a purchasing policy 
that states that as any appliance or plumbing fixture wears out, it must 
be replaced with a water-saving model.
Reducing energy usage
Energy conservation is embodied in every aspect of a green building, and 
you may be surprised by how much you can dramatically reduce energy by 
employing green-building techniques aimed at energy conservation. Your 
team of hired, professional advisors (see the later section “Professional Help 
You May Need” for more on these folks) can work with you to prioritize the 
features that will yield the greatest energy savings for your building.
Plan on having lengthy conversations surrounding the
 
✓ Building envelope: Optimal energy performance comes from a solid 
infrastructure, or building envelope (wall systems, windows, doors, 
insulation, and roofing components). A building envelope that provides 
adequate ventilation for indoor air quality while maximizing energy 
conservation is key to a high-performing building.
 
✓ Lighting system: An energy-efficient lighting system includes dimmers, 
timers, bulbs, ballasts, task-specific lighting, and integrated natural 
daylight.
 
✓ Heat-recovery systems: Depending on how much hot water your facility 
uses, this feature can be a no-brainer. A heat-recovery system is a coil 
installed in the water outflow drain that absorbs heat from hot water 
and circulates it back into the building where it can be used in radiant 
floor heating or manufacturing processes.
 
✓ Heating and cooling systems: A full 60 to 70 percent of your build-
ing’s energy may be expended to keep it at the proper temperature. 
Nonrenewable energy systems, including gas and electricity, are the 
most common methods for heating water and air and powering the 
pumps and fans used to heat and cool your building.

166
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
 If you need to go with a traditional mechanical system, be sure to choose 
one that’s Energy Star–certified. Of course, conduct a thorough cost-benefit 
analysis of ground source heat pumps (that use underground water’s natu-
rally modulated temperature to reduce the amount of energy needed) and 
radiant floor heating before making a final choice.
Getting energy from renewable sources
 
Many entrepreneurs, owners, and managers are beginning to realize that oil 
addiction will soon require a serious 12-step program. But contrary to the 
theory on how to wean a person from a substance, going cold turkey simply 
isn’t an option when it comes to fossil fuels. Instead, you have to limit energy 
usage where you can and then consider the next step — ensuring that what-
ever energy does need to be expended relies heavily on renewable resources. 
Renewable energy refers to energy from resources that can’t be depleted, 
such as wind, sunlight, biomass, heat stored beneath the Earth’s surface, and 
flowing and/or hot water. These natural energy sources can be converted into 
mechanical, electrical, or chemical energy.
Unlike fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide into the air and contribute to 
everything from biodiversity loss to coral bleaching to climate change (see 
Chapter 2 for more details), renewables are clean and don’t emit greenhouse 
gases. So which one is best to use?
The future of energy conservation: 
Demand-response technology
Facilities of the future will most likely include 
demand-response technology. These are sys-
tems designed to protect businesses against 
energy interruption and maximize energy effi-
ciency. Demand-response technology allows 
the existing electrical grid to “talk” to your 
business’s computers, appliances, and other 
power-sucking devices — even asking them 
to respond to peak energy-consumption peri-
ods by adjusting your building’s temperatures 
and lighting to avoid brownouts. On the supply 
side, the smart power grid refers to the use of 
communication software to make the current 
electrical power grid operate more efficiently. 
You can actually view your facility’s energy 
consumption through a smart-grid meter.
Already rolled out in housing markets in Toronto 
and coming in 2009 to Boulder, Colorado, 
demand-response technology may be worth 
investigating for your business. See how you 
can be a part of it by visiting www.gridwise.

Energy–funded pilot project going on in the 
northwest United States.

 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
Often, the best renewable energy portfolio choice is a mix of several options.
 
✓ Wind: Wind is the world’s fastest growing renewable. Wind turbines 
convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity. As turbine capac-
ity grows, the cost of wind power decreases, making wind more attrac-
tive as a renewable energy source. The indications are that pursuit of 
wind power will accelerate in the next three to five years in the U.S. and 
Canada, further driving down the price.
 
✓ Solar: By almost any measure, sunlight is the greenest of the renewable 
energies. It’s perpetually available, produces no emissions or waste, 
and can be converted into either heat or electricity. Also, it’s being har-
vested, stored, and distributed in new and innovative ways, including 
the use of solar shingles that combine solar cells with slate, metal, or 
asphalt roofing. You can benefit from solar power through both active 
methods (such as using silicon wafers) and passive methods (like orient-
ing your facility to absorb and use direct sunlight).
 
 The capability to manufacture solar cells is growing globally. Silicon 
wafer production facilities are springing up in North America, adding to 
the significant manufacturing capacity already found in Germany and 
Japan. As this capacity continues ramping up to meet demand, the price 
of solar energy will fall, causing many energy brokers to predict that 
solar energy will outpace wind power within a decade.
 
✓ Biomass: Plant matter or biodegradable waste used to generate electricity 
(or produce biofuels) is referred to as biomass energy. Of particular 
promise in the U.S. is the use of wood biomass in timber-intensive states.
 
✓ Geothermal: Generating power from heat that’s naturally stored 
beneath the Earth’s surface is a promising source of renewable energy. 
Ground source heat pumps harvest this energy to heat and cool build-
ings. The great thing about geothermal energy is that you can supply 
your building with warm water by using the byproduct of the energy-
generation process. There’s a lot of interest in geothermal systems due 
to their reasonable cost of installation and maintenance, as well as their 
energy-efficient properties.
 
✓ Hydropower: Hydropower refers to energy derived from the force of 
moving water. Turbines located in the water flow harness this energy for 
use in many capacities. Hydropower is a significantly developed source 
of energy in the U.S. and Canada already and is very reasonably priced.
 
Certain challenges are inherent in using almost every type of renewable energy. 
Early wind turbines were tied to migratory bird deaths; hydropower is currently 
controversial for its impact on wild fisheries; and ethanol is partially responsible 
for an escalating global food crisis. Make sure to do your homework on the pros 
and cons of the renewable energy source you’re considering using.

Cleaning up indoor air quality
Providing good indoor air quality is essential if you want to be considered a 
socially responsible corporation and have healthy, productive employees. 
Poor indoor air leads to Sick Building Syndrome (SBS). People with this con-
dition complain of acute health discomfort. Complaints consist primarily of 
headaches; difficulty concentrating; irritation in the eyes, nose, or throat; dry 
coughs; itchy skin; dizziness; nausea; fatigue; and ultra-sensitivity to odors. 
Introducing living buildings and green roofs
Some visionary designers are already looking 
past green buildings to the next generation of 
structures — living buildings. This holistic type 
of architecture applies to buildings that act like 
natural organisms, with components that sense 
and react to differing levels of temperature, 
carbon dioxide, water runoff, and other eco-
logical occurrences. The structures themselves 
are self sustaining and even give back to the 
environment. Imagine a building that’s actually 
ecologically restorative! Think of structures that 
capture and recycle rainwater endlessly, using 
it to create a rooftop habitat that increases 
biodiversity in urban areas. Sound far-fetched 
and hopelessly futuristic? Think again — such 
structures are already here! To find out more 
about living buildings, visit the Cascadia Region 
Green Building Council’s Web site at www.
cascadiagbc.org/lbc.
Some design ideas already being explored will 
surely be incorporated into living buildings of 
the future:
 ✓ Smart shades: Made of metal compos-
ites that are highly sensitive to thermal 
changes, these shades curl up in the winter 
and expand for full coverage in the summer, 
thereby controlling a building’s interior solar 
rays depending on the season.
 ✓ Windows embedded with carbon 
dioxide–sensitive sensors: An electric 
current activated by carbon dioxide causes 
a contraction of wires that slightly open 
slits etched into the window. When proper 
ventilation is achieved, the electric current 
subsides, the slits close, and the sensitive 
wires return to normal.
Green, or living, roofs are a very progressive 
alternative you may want to consider as well. 
Green roofs have been incorporated in projects 
ranging from urban office spaces to the huge, 
industrialized Ford Rouge River revitalization 
project taking place in Dearborn, Michigan. 
Living roofs have a multitude of benefits:
 ✓ Reduced heating and cooling costs (during 
winter months, a green roof can reduce 
heat loss by 25 percent or more)
 ✓ A longer life span than their conventional 
counterparts
 ✓ Provision of a natural habitat and consump-
tion of carbon dioxide
 ✓ Significant decrease in stormwater runoff
 ✓ Aesthetic beauty that can add value to your 
facility, including providing a habitat for 
butterflies and birds
Although the individual design of green roofs 
may vary, they all share basic similarities. 
Check out www.greenroofs.com for the 
latest in technology, new projects, consultants, 
and other resources related to green roofs.

 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
If an unprecedented number of your employees complain of these health 
issues, your building may be giving them SBS. What can cause this condition?
 
✓ Inadequate ventilation: If your original building design didn’t con-
tain provisions for adequate ventilation, contaminated indoor air has 
nowhere to go. Proper ventilation is a key element of sustainable design. 
Be sure to incorporate a mechanical engineer’s advice on providing for 
an adequate mix of indoor and outdoor air.
 
✓ Chemical contaminants from indoor sources: From the glues and adhe-
sives in flooring to the textiles in your office furniture and the paint on 
the walls, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are swirling around most 
indoor work environments. These VOCs, including formaldehyde, are 
toxic indoor pollutants. Considering most people spend 80 percent of 
their lives indoors, improving indoor air quality is one of the most com-
pelling social benefits of greening your facility.
 
✓ Chemical contaminants from outdoor sources: The outdoor air that enters 
a building can contain pollutants from motor vehicle exhausts, plumbing 
vents, and building exhausts (found primarily in restrooms and cafeterias).
 
✓ Biological contaminants: Unseen nasties like bacteria, molds, pollen, and 
viruses may be hiding in your building’s ducts, or any place that water 
has permeated, such as carpeting, insulation, or ceiling tiles. Biological 
contaminants can also emanate from insect, bird, or rodent droppings.
Any of these items can act together to intensify the effect of SBS on human 
health. However, this condition can be difficult to diagnose, and even when 
it is diagnosed, pinpointing the specific source of the complaint, much less 
remediating the problem, is even more challenging.
 
One step you can take to combat SBS, especially if you can’t afford a brand-
new building right now, is to ensure that your adhesives, paints, flooring, and 
wall coverings contain few or no VOCs. Look for the GREENGUARD certifica-
tion, shown in Figure 8-2, on these products or their packaging.
 
Figure 8-2: 
The GREEN
GUARD 
certification 
ensures few 
or no-VOCs 
are included 
in a variety 
of building 
materials.

Professional Help You May Need
If you determine that constructing a new, green facility, or renovating an existing 
space, is in fact the best tactic for your company, keep in mind that you aren’t 
embarking on this journey alone. You’re going to have a team of experienced 
sustainable building professionals working for you and guiding you through the 
process of designing and constructing your green facility or remodel.
The following sections highlight some of the folks you may need to consult, 
depending on the type and breadth of the greening you want to do. And of 
course you’ll want to make sure these pros understand that your facility is 
a core part of your green strategy and your organization’s commitment to a 
sound sustainability policy.
 
Always perform the following due diligence on prospective members of your 
green-building team before finalizing your selections:
 
✓ Request a reference list and make calls. Follow a prepared script of 
questions that delves into how well the candidate stuck to budgets and 
timelines, how he or she managed a worksite, how pleasant the candi-
date was to work with, and especially how well he or she listened and 
responded to client needs. Ask the referrals direct questions relating to 
the depth and breadth of the candidate’s sustainable design knowledge. 
If feasible, go visit the sites and see the candidate’s work for yourself.
 
✓ Interview each prospective candidate. Ask specific questions pertain-
ing to green building — how many ecoprojects the candidate has been 
involved with, how much continuing education has he or she received in 
sustainable construction/design, and what are his or her greatest green 
accomplishments. Provide a brief description of your project and ask 
for ideas upfront about what sorts of sustainability-oriented features the 
candidate recommends.
Architect
Whether or not to hire an architect is arguably one of the most important 
decisions you’ll make because an architect can guide you through design, 
contractor negotiations, and a myriad of other critical steps in your project. 
The different services an architect provides depend on your individual situa-
tion and the extent of your remodeling or new construction project. Cost and 
internal expertise will drive your decision as to whether to hire an architect 
for these sorts of projects.
 
By law, you must have an architect onboard if your proposed renovation will 
impact the building inhabitants’ safety, such as structural modifications or 
changes to entrances and exits. If your renovation project won’t put anyone’s 
safety in danger, the decision to hire an architect is completely up to you.

171
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
Architects offer a wide set of services. You may contract an architect to
 
✓ Conduct a sustainability assessment of your current facility: This 
assessment involves conducting energy modeling on the structure to 
evaluate interventions and see how well they might perform. An effec-
tive assessment measures potential energy savings against the cost of 
upgrades that may be available in a retrofit situation and is a valuable 
tool for analyzing your current facility’s performance.
 
✓ Make general suggestions and provide counsel on the direction of a 
project: Architects are a great resource for reigning in or encouraging 
your company’s vision. They can offer practical guidance (as well as 
advice based on zoning regulations) on issues such as parking, 
accessibility, and the positioning of your facility on the property.
 
✓ Create a full set of drawings: Architects can transpose preliminary 
sketches into full-scale architectural drafts, including product 
specifications.
 
An architect’s advice is essential during the site-selection process, so if you’re 
thinking about hiring an architect, plan on interviewing and hiring him or her 
way in advance of your anticipated project start-up date.
 
A good starting point in locating a commercial architect who understands 
sustainable design is to scan a list of LEED-certified commercial buildings in 
your region. In many areas of the U.S., only a handful of firms tend to spearhead 
green-building projects, so they’ll jump off the page at you. In other parts of 
the country, you may have a plethora of firms to choose from.
To legally call oneself an architect, a person must be licensed by his or 
her state’s licensure agency. This designation indicates that the person 
passed a rigorous test and possesses a standardized level of competency. 
Unfortunately, sometimes people use the term “architectural draftsper-
son” without having undergone state licensure. To ensure that the person 
you’re considering for your project has been appropriately recognized as a 
bona fide architect, go to your preferred Internet search engine and type in 
“licensed architects” and your state’s name.
The best current indicator that a person has exposure to green-building con-
cepts is the LEED Accredited Professional (AP) certification (see the earlier 
“LEED-certification specifics” sidebar for tips on finding a LEED AP). This is, 
however, a generalist accreditation and doesn’t necessarily address specific 
competencies such as energy modeling or passive solar assessment.
 
Belonging to the American Institute of Architects (AIA), although profession-
ally enriching to the individual, simply means that the person has paid his or 
her dues to the national association. In no way does AIA membership indicate 
the architect in question is competent or experienced.

172
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
Ask your architect whether his or her firm includes a landscape architect and/
or a biomechanical engineer. If an architectural firm is indeed tapped into sus-
tainable design, it either directly employs this expertise or subcontracts for it. 
If the firm doesn’t seem to have a handle on this level of expertise, consider 
that a red flag and look to the next architect on your list.
Contractor
Your contractor, or builder, takes the design work prepared by your archi-
tect and converts that pretty paper or digital picture into your new physical 
space by coordinating materials purchasing and delivery, supplier payment, 
worksite safety, subcontracted labor, and the like.
If your remodel is small and tightly scoped, you may not need a general con-
tractor, who usually adds 10 percent onto the subcontractors’ bids. After 
all, do you really want to incur that extra surcharge on a highly specific sus-
tainable renovation project, such as adding insulation and a metal roof? On 
bigger, more complex remodels and additions, however, you may be working 
with 20 or more different subcontractors. In this scenario, the extra fees of a 
general contractor who can oversee all the subs are worthwhile.
 
In the absence of a general contractor, you, as the building owner, become the 
de facto general contractor.
If and when you’re ready to start the contractor hunt, gather a list of contrac-
tors in your area who’ve been involved in commercial green-building proj-
ects. Solicit referrals from your architect and do your own research as well 
by contacting your county or city building department to inquire whether a 
green-builder education program is available in your area. If one is, obtain a 
list of certified green builders from the program’s facilitator.
 
After you’ve whittled down your prospects to a list of three to six contractors 
(depending on the size and complexity of your project), ask each candidate 
to price out the project both with and without individual sustainable features. 
For example, solar panels, graywater recycling systems, or ground source 
heat pumps are features that should be lined out on the bid sheet individu-
ally. This proposal method allows you to prioritize which green attributes are 
most important to your company if the total project numbers come in higher 
than your expectations. It also provides you with the opportunity to see more 
clearly how individual components contribute to total project costs.

173
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
Also, ask which subcontractors your general contractor prospects use 
for the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) work. The American 
Subcontractors Association gives out annual awards for “Best MEP,” so 
ask your candidate whether he or she knows of any subs who’ve received 
this award. Or check it out for yourself by searching for “American 
Subcontractors Association” and your area’s name on the Internet and see 
whether that particular region provides a list of recent recipients.
 
Don’t make your final choice based on price alone. Particularly with green 
construction, less is by no means the best. The bids you receive from your 
narrowed list of potential contractors should be pretty tightly clustered. If one 
bid is significantly below the others (by say 15 to 20 percent or more), make 
sure that the contractor understood the specs or didn’t forget to include 
something big. Otherwise you could end up with a subpar job or miss out on a 
sustainable feature you really wanted to incorporate.
Interior designer
Although sustainably harvested wood and a ground source heat pump are 
crucial components of your green building, most of your clients, employees, 
and other stakeholders don’t see ’em. What they do see is your office furni-
ture, cabinetry, restrooms, cafeteria, breakroom, floors, and window cover-
ings. Choosing an interior designer who understands sustainable design is a 
critical finishing touch to your green building.
Some projects will necessarily involve an interior designer. For example, if 
you’re interested in renovating a large, open work area that’s going to be 
refurnished, you’ll need help designing workflow and lighting. In this case, 
you may go right to an interior designer without first hiring an architect or 
contractor.
On more comprehensive projects, you may want to hire an interior designer 
to give you an overview of what your design considerations entail. Full-
service consultation includes not only a design plan but also a professional 
to liaise with vendors, coordinate purchases, and make recommendations to 
fulfill your sustainable interior needs.
 
If you have in-house expertise and want to save on professional fees, you may 
want to contract for an interior-design consultation and the production of a 
design plan. This way you get the benefit of expert guidance and save money 
by implementing the plan internally.

174
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
Be sure to test out your prospective interior designer’s green knowledge by 
asking about his or her prior experience with PVC-free and natural carpets 
and floor coverings, organic textiles, low-VOC paints/finishes, and recycled/
reclaimed woods. If your questions solicit a look of incomprehension, you may 
want to rethink your choice.
Getting Down to Business
 
Assessing your renovation needs requires considering what specifically is 
mandated by law and what’s guided by aesthetic desire. If you’re changing any 
corridors that affect exiting, modifying points of access, or structurally alter-
ing any part of your building, you must have an architect onboard to guide 
you through the process (see the earlier “Architect” section for help hiring 
one). If you’re replacing windows and doors, painting, changing out plumbing, 
or doing cosmetic renovation without an architect, you may take your renova-
tions one step at a time.
What goes on in the space around your building is just as important as 
what goes on inside it. Visit different undeveloped and commercial tracts 
of land, parcels in business parks, urban areas ripe for transformation, and 
even brownfield sites (contaminated areas usually available at a good price 
because of the associated clean-up costs). Imagine the different ways you 
could build your facility to complement existing wind and solar patterns, 
water flow, and biological elements.
Of course, green building and remodeling present some interesting chal-
lenges. As with anything innovative, you’re better off acknowledging these 
challenges upfront and preparing for them accordingly. Here are some of the 
most common challenges you may run into:
 
✓ Mechanical features in a green building may not respond to manual 
change as quickly as employees are used to. Some of the switches and 
gauges in green buildings may not provide results as quickly as the sys-
tems you currently use. For example, HVAC units that rely on radiant heat 
or natural cooling won’t immediately adjust the temperature the moment 
an employee touches a dial. Alert employees to expect some slowdown in 
certain areas so they’re not disappointed if the office’s new green features 
don’t provide the immediate satisfaction they’re accustomed to.
 
✓ Some aspects of greening your facility require mitigating their adverse 
effects. Green construction has special challenges. For example, siting 
a building to maximize daylighting requires adding other features to 
reduce the resulting glare. Likewise, installing a living roof (see the 
earlier sidebar) requires adding more structural support to the building. 
Being aware of the pros and cons to any specific features or systems 
you’re installing helps you prepare building inhabitants (and executive 
management) for what to expect.

175
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
 
✓ New green products may require staff training. Sustainable products, 
such as dual-flush toilets and solar hot water heaters, don’t function like 
their traditional counterparts — a fact that may cause anxiety for users. 
If you’re looking at such products, have a plan in place to train staff in 
the use of your building’s new green features.
 
✓ Certain sustainable features may look odd to the unaccustomed eye. 
Not all green features are going to appear familiar to your customers, 
employees, and investors. For example, most people are used to seeing 
uniform, freshly mown lawns surrounding office buildings. By contrast, 
native landscaping (like long grass prairie) may appear scruffy or unten-
ded. You may want to place placards around and about these areas that 
explain how much water and energy this landscaping saves, as well as 
the fact that it’s free of pesticides. Using placards simultaneously gener-
ates interest in the project and provides educational value.
 
The best way to address any challenges associated with green features is to 
be prepared to openly address them and help stakeholders understand that 
new technology sometimes takes a while to get used to.
Picking renovation projects
If you’ve chosen to renovate certain aspects of your existing facility, you can 
benefit from two good assessment tools designed to help you identify your 
building’s key performance problems, as well as solutions that may help you 
maintain and improve its long-term performance. After you have the results 
of one of the following assessment tools, you can begin prioritizing what’s 
most crucial to deal with first:
 
✓ Green Globes Continual Improvement Tool for Existing Buildings 
(Green Globes-CIEB) is a Web-based tool that guides you through the 
creation of a baseline of your building’s performance and identification 
of persistent problems. In an interactive way, you can walk through 
potential improvement scenarios and plan for and monitor the success 
of your prioritized green remodeling projects. This tool has been used 
in Canada for years and is just being introduced to the U.S. To see a free 
teaser version, go to www.thegbi.org/lp/freetrial.asp.
 
✓ LEED for Existing Building: Operations & Maintenance is adminis-
tered by the U.S. Green Building Council and incorporates the organiza-
tion’s trademark rating system to help building owners create a plan 
to transition their current structure to a high-performing one. This tool 
captures physical systems (like mechanical systems and land use) and 
the manner in which the building is used (waste stream and commuting 
programs) in developing a plan to enhance the building’s sustainable 
performance potential. Check out what this tool looks like by going to 
www.usgbc.org/leed, clicking the LEED Rating Systems link at the 
top of the page, and then clicking the Existing Buildings: Operations & 
Maintenance link on the right-hand side.

Alternatively, you can browse this list of different projects for some initial 
remodeling ideas. Just make sure you always analyze the costs versus the ben-
efits. For example, a new heating and air conditioning system is a big-ticket 
remodel, but it may yield a payback within three to five years.
 
✓ Install water-efficient plumbing fixtures such as dual-flush toilets, water-
less urinals, or low-flow faucets.
 
✓ Install on-demand water heaters (meaning the water is only heated when 
it’s needed) or solar water heaters.
 
✓ Retrofit lighting systems incrementally (via programmable timers and 
compact fluorescent light bulbs) or in totality.
 
✓ Replace floor coverings with carpet tiles or commercial-grade bamboo.
 
✓ Install energy-pinching mechanical systems such as an Energy Star fur-
nace, air conditioning system, or solar hot water heater.
 
✓ Upgrade windows and doors to high-efficiency models to reduce heating 
and cooling loss.
 
✓ Blow in more recycled content or natural insulation.
 
✓ Install programmable thermostats.
 
✓ Update roofing material from heat-absorbing asphalt shingles to high-
recycled content metal or other recycled-content shingles.
 
✓ Add automated shades to maximize daylighting while reducing glare.
 
✓ Weatherize existing windows.
 
✓ Trade out your pesticide-laden, water-intensive lawn for native 
landscaping to add visual interest and habitat on your commercial 
grounds.
Planning the site for your new building
 
Site planning takes an aesthetic eye as well as technical expertise, usually in 
the form of a biomechanical or bioclimatic engineer. When planning out a new 
location for your facility, pay close attention to
 
✓ Biodiversity needs: Retaining as much natural native vegetation as 
possible is always the best way to preserve existing biodiversity. Aim 
high — set goals to increase habitat availability. As much as possible, 
incorporate existing trees and native landscaping.

177
 Chapter 8: Looking Closely at the Brick and Mortar: Facilities
 
✓ Wind, water, thermal, and solar patterns: In warmer climates, design 
your site to augment cooling breezes; likewise, in colder areas, design 
your site to block arctic winds. If you’re in a part of the country with 
good solar potential, site your building so you can harness this free and 
renewable energy (south facing exposures are great for solar panels or 
shingles, for example). Heat energy can be stored in materials referred 
to as thermal mass, such as masonry and water, and you should con-
sider this info when outlining the materials you want to use and the 
angle at which you want to place your new construction.
 
✓ Access to the property: Predetermine the easiest ways to get to and 
from your facility by methods other than single-passenger vehicles. Can 
supplies, inventory, customers, and employees easily access your facil-
ity by using alternative transportation? If that’s not feasible in all cases, 
strive to shorten the length of road you need to construct.
 
✓ Minimization of stormwater runoff: Stormwater runoff is accelerated in 
many commercial buildings because of the large square footage of park-
ing lots. As the water hits the asphalt and runs off, it accumulates pol-
lutants on the ground that mix together in a pretty toxic stew. Managing 
this flow naturally is part of your site-planning process and can be done 
by using some fairly simple (and very ancient) methods. Also, asphalt 
contributes to heat islands and is made from petroleum, so minimizing 
its usage is an important consideration in green construction.
 
✓ Security: This consideration depends on the exposure of your facility to 
potential security breaches. If your organization has high-profile secu-
rity needs, you may want to engage an architect who has experience in 
designing buildings that have antiterrorist characteristics, for example.
 
✓ Noise barriers: Natural noise barriers, like berms and plantings, may 
decrease noise marginally. However, the only true way to decrease noise is 
by distance, which may or may not be a feasible variable in your situation.
 
✓ Daylighting potential: Early on in the design phase, it’s important to 
understand building orientation as it pertains to the location of doors 
and windows that will serve as shade providers. Increased daylighting 
reduces the need for artificial lighting, may result in lower heating and 
cooling costs, and is a gentler, more pleasant light to work under.
 
✓ Views: Siting a building to maximize your view is valuable, albeit 
secondary to most of the previously listed considerations.

Sustainable deconstruction
Most renovations generate a tremendous 
amount of waste, and disposing of that waste 
costs money. Because you’re a good environ-
mental steward, when deconstructing part of 
an existing building with the anticipation of 
remodeling, decide what can be reused in the 
remodel effort. Lots of components, including 
cabinetry, beams, flooring, shingles, and so on, 
can be reused.
Think you’ll need a hand developing a good 
construction-waste-elimination plan? Run an 
Internet search using the name of your town 
and “deconstruction services” to see what 
resources you can find. The cost of recycling 
on-site often offsets conventional waste-dis-
posal costs.
When refurbishing an existing facility, consider 
the following:
 ✓ Make sure your general contractor and 
subcontractors understand sustainability. 
From the subs on-site to the designers and 
project planners, everyone on the project 
needs to know the importance of reducing 
waste.
 ✓ Use a crusher on-site to recycle shingles, 
concrete, stone, and the like. Reprocess 
existing demolished materials for reuse as 
landscaping and roadfill.
 ✓ Use excavated materials for contouring 
and landscaping. As an added bonus, you 
can create sound and privacy barriers by 
using these materials.
 ✓ Reuse deconstructed material creatively. 
The only limit to using deconstructed mate-
rial is one’s imagination, so think outside 
the box. Old brick can be used as an inter-
esting component in garden pathways; old 
wood can live anew as flooring or cabinetry 
fronts.
 ✓ Work with suppliers and contractors who 
have a take-back policy. Look for people on 
your building team who accept surplus sup-
plies. Don’t expect a credit for the returned 
goods but know that, from a sustainability 
standpoint, ensuring the materials are used 
in another project is better than letting them 
go into a landfill.

▶ Figuring out where to turn for start-up capital for your green projects
N
egotiating sustainable financing and leasing packages, developing 
green banking relationships, and repositioning your portfolio to feature 
socially responsible companies offer tons of sustainable development oppor-
tunities. Engaging in such green accounting practices also provides access 
to new and creative financing instruments, chances to develop partnerships 
with other forward-thinking businesspeople, and occasions to enhance your 
company’s image as a green business and elevate your branding efforts.
Moving your money, loans, credit cards, and investment portfolio to sustain-
able counterparts isn’t something you can accomplish overnight. But that 
doesn’t mean you shouldn’t prioritize these tasks, all of which fall on your 
accounting team. In this chapter, I outline the various sustainable account-
ing and financing options available and explain their value so you can decide 
how you want to incorporate them into your business structure.
Understanding What Green 
Finances Entail
 
Green financial service providers exhibit evidence of triple-bottom-line 
manifestation in their operations, products, and policies. If you work with a 
particular financial institution and don’t observe examples that specifically 
address all three aspects of the triple bottom line (people, planet, and profit; 
see Chapter 1 for more on the triple bottom line), then you should reconsider 
whether working with that institution is really in your business’s best interest.

180
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Following are some hallmarks of green financial service providers:
 
✓ People: To serve the people aspect of the triple bottom line, financial 
service providers mandate employee/customer policies that center on 
sustainable ideals. Examples of such policies and programs include
 
• Helping lower-income folks purchase their first homes through 
Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), which operate like an IRA.
 
• Participating in other community-development programs, such as 
donating 1 percent of net income to philanthropic causes.
 
• Having a stringent policy against predatory lending — programs 
such as pay-day or car title loans that have extremely high interest 
rates and potentially devastating results on low-income earners.
 
• Matching employees’ charitable dollars or volunteer hours up to a 
certain limit.
 
• Giving a percentage of bank-sponsored credit card transaction fees 
to local environmental organizations.
 
✓ Planet: Financial institutions may engage in the following environmen-
tally conscious activities:
 
• Providing debit and credit cards made from biobased raw materials.
 
• Offering online banking and other green options, such as direct 
deposit of paychecks and new ATMs that don’t use envelopes or 
receipts.
 
• Issuing bank statements, financial statements, and sustainability 
reports online instead of in hard-copy form.
 
• Renovating existing facilities to employ green-building concepts 
rather than using virgin resources to build new structures.
 
• Implementing greener operational strategies with the aim of 
becoming carbon neutral.
 
• Offering green accounts, mortgages, credit cards, and other services.
 
• Providing financial support for green projects and organizations 
through the bank’s foundation.
 
✓ Profit: Clearly, the traditional bottom line also needs to be addressed. 
Green financial institutions focus on supporting organizations and projects 
that merge environmental and social concerns with profit enhancement by
 
• Sanctioning projects that have the triple bottom line embedded 
in their proposals and working with noncompliant companies and 
organizations to bring them up to green speed.

181
 Chapter 9: Greening Your Accounting Practices
 
• Focusing on relocalization, which is a fancy way of saying looking 
to your local vendors and distributors for products and services. 
The financial institution supports relocalization by creating new, 
locally owned, independent businesses in your community to keep 
profits circulating in your area. (Because relocalization is the cor-
nerstone of many sustainable business practices, I’ve devoted a 
whole chapter to it; see Chapter 11 for more information on this 
hot topic.)
Working with a green financial service provider not only showcases true 
commitment to greening your organization but it also contributes to enhance-
ment of societal benefits.
Why Green Your Accounting Practices?
 
So what’s in it for you and your business when it comes to greening your cor-
porate accounting practices? Connections for one thing! Bankers and financial 
institutions that have a keen eye toward the emerging green sector can serve 
as powerful liaisons for you to meet other like-minded businesspeople.
You may be surprised how delving into new financial relationships based 
on green parameters draws you into a whole new circle of people who can 
enhance your business’s sustainability potential. When you begin meeting 
your community’s green-finance players, the networking possibilities become 
endless because of the number of other local businesses they deal with. 
These new ecocontacts — think up-and-coming green marketing firms, 
sustainable builders, and other businesses that are transitioning to green 
practices — have the potential to develop into good partners for your 
business.
Another big reason is the perception stakeholders get when the Chief 
Financial Officer of an organization announces that corporate account-
ing is going green. Even though the budget doesn’t just emanate from the 
accounting team, such an announcement allows your outside ecoimage to tie 
together. When customers and employees see not only green products and 
sustainable operations but also alliances with green financial institutions and 
credit card companies, the cohesiveness of a truly green organization is 
readily apparent.

How to Green Your Accounting 
Practices: The Basics
Regardless of the size of your business, in order to effectively implement 
green accounting policies and practices, someone — whether that’s one 
person or a team of folks from your business service area — must understand 
the importance of developing new financial relationships and decision-
making tools to support your company’s broader greening endeavors. The 
accounting staff is responsible for communicating how sustainable decision-
making considers triple-bottom-line layers of impact instead of focusing on 
traditional short-term profit.
Tracking sustainable companies’ performance in 
the financial markets
The flow of capital into companies formed to 
market sustainable products, technologies, and 
services has gone from a trickle to a deluge in 
the last couple years. One can only imagine that 
even more formalized markets will emerge in 
response to this groundswell of interest.
Here are some of the avenues through which 
you can follow the performance of ecocompa-
nies that are firmly committed to a sustainable 
business model:
 ✓ Dow Jones Sustainability North America 
Index: This index tracks more than 100 of the 
600 largest organizations in North America 
in terms of sustainable operations. Based 
on the Dow Jones World Sustainability 
Index, this index started its North American 
performance tracking in 2005. Visit www.
sustainability-index.com to see 
a list of tracked companies and an encour-
aging comparison of these companies’ 
performance over time compared to other 
major market indices.
 ✓ The Green Exchange: This exchange has 
recently commenced operations as part 
of the New York Mercantile Exchange 
(NYMEX). With big investment brokerage 
firms partnering with the NYMEX, the Green 
Exchange will provide trading capacity for 
environmental products, specifically those 
designed to deal with pollution reduction, 
renewable energy technologies, and cli-
mate change damage mitigation.
Looking to the future, keep an eye out for the BX 
public stock exchange, which is currently in the 
works. This exchange is a creation of B Lab, a 
nonprofit organization that provides a company-
wide certification for sustainable businesses 
known as B Corporation certification (which I 
describe in much greater detail in Chapter 14). 
The B Lab cofounders are modeling the BX 
public stock exchange on the United Kingdom’s 
Social Stock Exchange and are deeply commit-
ted to developing a private stock exchange that 
will evolve into a public marketplace with only 
value-congruent companies listed. Not only are 
they working with some high-profile financial 
institutions, venture capitalists, and investment 
intermediaries to make this exchange a real-
ity but they’re also helping these companies 
to become B Corporations themselves, thus 
adding more credence to companies pursuing 
a socially responsible model.

183
 Chapter 9: Greening Your Accounting Practices
In annual budget preparation, for example, the accounting team can generate 
conversation about how investing in big-ticket items today (like renewable 
energy technologies for your plant) has triple-bottom-line payoffs later due 
to reduced total ownership and maintenance costs, increased environmental 
stewardship, and creation of local green-collar jobs.
Budgeting in most companies is based on existing organizational structure — 
department, geographic area, or product line, for example. Creating a mentality 
(and system) for incentivizing managers to consider budget requests that can 
benefit the whole company and are based on measurable data and resulting 
sustainability improvements is a feat that should rest with your accounting 
folks. After all, with the various measurements they’ve created for the numer-
ous facets of your organization’s sustainability operations, they’re the ones 
who have the closest relationship to your data and your budget.
Your accounting team doesn’t operate in a vacuum, though, and it isn’t nec-
essarily the gatekeeper of all things budgetary. Don’t be afraid to spark your 
own creative thoughts on how to incentivize green behavior and then track 
interdepartmental impacts. Try some of these ideas on for size:
 
✓ Paying for managers to attend sustainability training may come out of 
the HR budget and yet provoke your lead engineer to design your next 
best-selling product because she became intrigued with biomimicry 
(emulating nature in product design). How do you track this? Follow up 
the training in six months with a questionnaire asking for direct work-
related changes attributable to the training sessions. Craft a colorful 
chart highlighting sustainability accomplishments that arose from the 
training, with dollars spent per employee training hour translated into 
economic gain and increased employee satisfaction.
 
✓ Engaging third-party certifiers to assess your supply chain partners’ 
sustainability comes out of the production budget. But sales increase 
because a new distributor is interested in carrying your authentic green 
product line. Data presentation should link the new expense with the 
increased sales and illustrate the percentage of supply chain partners 
now authenticated.
 
✓ The budget for cleaning up a brownfield (contaminated site) you own 
comes out of your Environmental Management budget, but corporate 
commercial liability insurance premiums decrease 8 percent due to 
decreased risk exposure. Getting managers together quarterly to discuss 
ripple effects of sustainability initiatives will flesh this out.
 
Budgeting for sustainability initiatives gets caught up in the ripple effect that 
occurs between departments. That’s why you should cross-departmentally 
track benefits that accrue from sustainability investments as much as possi-
ble. Doing so gives you what you need to go back to the higher-ups, showcase 
results, and ask for green capital in the future!

184
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
When you’re ready to green your company’s accounting team, do so in phases 
instead of issuing a blanket list of transformative mandates. Also, focus on one 
or two of the goals that seem most relevant to your business based on what’s 
already on the company’s future workplan. For example, if your lease is 
coming due in the next year, that may be a good place to center the account-
ing department’s green efforts (see the later “Encouraging your lender to offer 
green mortgages” sidebar for related tips). If you have some additional credit 
or refinancing projects that you’re looking at in the next operating cycle, those 
projects may be good places to start implementing green accounting prac-
tices. Where you begin greening your accounting practices isn’t nearly as 
important as actually jumping in and starting to effect change.
Choosing Green Financial Institutions
Greening your banking involves transitioning to a socially and environmen-
tally responsible financial institution, capitalizing on financing opportunities 
for your sustainability efforts, and making your money work harder by choos-
ing financial products that embody triple-bottom-line benefits. You may even 
want to consider moving your money to local financial institutions as part of 
focusing on a core sustainability principle: buying local (more on that topic 
in Chapter 11.)
In the following sections, I survey the facets of sustainable financial relationships 
so you can evaluate both current and prospective business partners and 
decide whether you’ll make changes to your day-to-day financial relationships 
(and if so, how you’ll go about doing that). If, after this cursory glance, you’re 
not feeling satisfied with your current financial institution’s sustainability 
efforts, maybe it’s time to look at other banking options (preferably within 
your local area) by adding these questions to all the typical economic 
evaluative criteria you always use when choosing a bank.
Focusing on practices
How can you assess whether a financial institution’s values are green? Start 
by typing in “green” or “sustainable” on the internal search engine of your 
bank’s Web site and see whether anything pops up. Then do some back-
ground research on the company to find answers to these questions:
 
✓ Does the institution have a formal sustainability or corporate social 
responsibility plan?
 
✓ What percentage of the bank’s loans (specifically those being made with 
your company’s deposits) is local?

185
 Chapter 9: Greening Your Accounting Practices
 
✓ Which company does the institution use to administer its credit card 
(see the later “Green credit cards” section for guidance on progressive 
green financial institutions)?
 
✓ Does the bank have a policy restricting its portfolio investments from 
funding unethical endeavors (like companies that engage in animal test-
ing or the manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction)?
 
✓ Has the institution engaged in predatory lending practices? Find out 
by searching the Center for Responsible Lending’s Web site (www.
responsiblelending.org), which provides an updated list of these 
financial institutions. (Remember: Like anything, the presence of an 
institution on this list is a red flag, not a definitive sign to cross the bank 
off your list. This is one consideration you really need to think about 
to decide whether you’re comfortable with your bank engaging in such 
practices.)
Considering investment locale
Because a core concept of sustainability is using local vendors (including 
financial institutions) as much as possible, you should always give your 
community banks and credit unions the first shot at your business. The 
biggest benefit is that you’re channeling your money where your mouth is. 
You’re also engaging in yet another tangible ecoaction to convey your green 
commitment to your stakeholders. Local banks lend to other local businesses, 
thereby expanding your sphere of green influence and contributing directly to 
the triple bottom line of one of your primary stakeholders — your local com-
munity. Community finance has virtually no drawbacks and with the collapse 
of several reputable national and international institutions, many organizations 
are feeling that local finance is a much less risky place to park their capital.
If you want to bank locally, you have two options: Community Development 
Banks (CDBs) and Community Development Credit Unions (CDCUs). These 
institutions may look and feel like the big bank next door, but their business 
models focus on permanent, long-term economic development of low- and 
moderate-income members of the community.
 
✓ Community Development Banks: CDBs offer all the products and ser-
vices that the giant conglomerates do (cash management, commercial 
checking accounts, certificates of deposit, lending, FDIC-insured money 
market accounts, and the like), but they provide one important addi-
tional service — programs geared toward enhancing economic justice 
for all in the community. They do this by designing specific programs 
targeted at community development, advocating at the state legisla-
ture to eliminate the availability of predatory funds, and listening and 
responding to your region’s unique capital needs.

186
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
 
✓ Community Development Credit Unions: CDCUs, which are nonprofit 
organizations owned by members (residents of a particular town or 
employees of a select employer), offer another sustainable option to 
super-sized financial institutions. They regularly rate high on consumer 
satisfaction surveys for their low fees, friendly service, and community 
commitment.
 
CDCUs may earn a few extra sustainability points because being member-
owned allows a wide constituency to participate in the benefits of ownership, 
compared with CDBs in which a few shareholders may own all the stock.
Credit unions may also specialize in ethically sound investments or use 
social and environmental screens to aid in their loan decisions. For example, 
Co-operative Financial Services (CFS) in the United Kingdom works with the 
local prison population to teach prisoners basic financial skills. It also places 
fee-free ATMs in low-income neighborhoods. Both programs were developed 
to maximize the credit union’s triple bottom line — and they’ve succeeded. 
CFS contributes to empowering socially impoverished people, offers oppor-
tunities to access financial services without travel, and increases profitability 
while developing a very loyal customer base.
 
You may have tapped into a network of fiscal progressives in the process of 
asking questions about a particular financial institution’s sustainability prac-
tices (see the preceding section). If so, these folks should be able to direct you 
to regional sources of sustainably minded financiers.
 
If you like a particular bank chain that’s not a CDB or CDCU and you want to 
know whether it keeps its money local, try taking a look at where that chain 
is headquartered. If its HQ is in your community, odds are good its money is 
staying there.
Finding Green Lenders and 
Financial Services
By and large, the sustainable financial products available today come in the 
form of green mortgages and credit cards, although green bank accounts are 
increasingly popular offerings.
 
When evaluating a particular financial institution’s green products, you may 
want to find out whether it’s familiar with green mortgages and whether it 
offers them or can link you to a mortgagor that can. You may also want to ask 
whether the institution provides information on or directly administers one 
of the new sustainable credit card programs that are springing up these days. 
Both products promote your business’s own sustainability efforts.

187
 Chapter 9: Greening Your Accounting Practices
Green bank accounts are primarily a means for the financial institution to 
incorporate sustainable operations — most of which center on carbon-reduc-
ing operational practices such as offering paperless statements and free 
online banking (although these perks are becoming much more status quo in 
traditional accounts). Some progressive banks, such as Umpqua in Portland, 
Oregon, are offering customers a chance to willingly donate interest from 
their checking accounts to an environmental organization, so keep your eyes 
open for emerging opportunities along these lines.
If you’re in need of financing for a particular green initiative —whether that’s 
retrofitting your building, converting your packaging line to a new sustainable 
material, or prototyping a new green product — lots of sustainably oriented 
loan programs are available through numerous banks and credit unions. 
Financial institutions such as Good Capital, ShoreBank Pacific, and New 
Resource Bank lead the way in traditional bank financing for green projects.
For now though, I focus on the two sustainable financial products you’re 
most likely to encounter — green mortgages and green credit cards.
Green mortgages
If your company is looking into sustainable building or remodeling, or if 
you’re thinking about purchasing a green facility, you may be a great fit for a 
green mortgage. Although many in the financing field are still scrambling to 
define a green mortgage, the generally accepted concept is that lenders give 
better rates for homes that are either already green (meaning the structure 
is energy efficient and has other sustainable design features) or are going to 
be newly built to incorporate such sustainable features. If you’re considering 
building or buying a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 
structure, or if you’re remodeling with the intent of obtaining LEED certifica-
tion, you may have a number of financing options in addition to your tradi-
tional ones. Chapter 8 covers LEED in greater detail.
Almost all green mortgages require the building in question to be highly energy 
efficient due to the immediate financial savings involved. The decreased oper-
ating costs inherent in owning an energy-efficient building make a green mort-
gage less risky due to the increased cash flow to the mortgagee because of his 
or her decreased utility costs. Anytime a mortgagee’s operating expenses are 
reduced, cash flow is increased, and the mortgagee’s ability to repay the debt 
is enhanced. (Flip to Chapter 8 for more on green buildings.)
 
The EcoBroker designation certifies that a licensed real estate agent has ful-
filled a set of requirements that include training in energy and environmental 
issues, as well as marketing. A real estate agent with this designation should 
have liaisons within the green mortgage industry. To find an EcoBroker–
certified realtor in your area, go to www.ecobroker.com and click the Find 
Your Local EcoBroker link in the column on the left-hand side of the page.

Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
Green credit cards
If your company uses credit cards for any purpose, you have yet another 
golden opportunity to get your green on. Not only are the physical green 
credit cards typically made of corn-based materials but they also offer an 
easy way to incorporate sustainability into the accounting functions of your 
company through at least one of the following ways:
 
✓ Banking miles to donate to environmental causes
 
✓ Participating in green-power projects
 
✓ Buying carbon offsets
 
✓ Contributing a percentage of each transaction to a philanthropic activity
 
If your current institution offers green credit cards, great! If not, the availabil-
ity (or lack thereof) of green credit cards isn’t something on which to solely 
base your banking-relationship decisions. After all, there aren’t many green 
credit cards out there yet, which means there’s no monitoring or certifying 
agency. Consider greening your banking relationship based on a financial 
institution’s sustainable practices and whether it keeps its money in the local 
community (by using the info found earlier in this chapter) and simply pick-
ing up a green credit card wherever you can get one.
You may want to consider one of the following green credit card options:
Encouraging your lender to offer green mortgages
If your lender isn’t currently onboard with green 
mortgages, encourage her to explore this new 
market by explaining that going green is shifting 
the industry. Her bank can ecoblaze a trail for 
others in the area to follow — and gain recog-
nition for it. Because of these perceived ben-
efits to the mortgagor, your negotiating power 
increases. Use these talking points to buy down 
the origination fee or interest rate for a mort-
gage, or to garner other loan concessions:
 ✓ Green buildings have enhanced value 
retention because of their extraordinarily 
high quality.
 ✓ Sustainable buildings have lower lifetime 
operating costs. Therefore, the mortgagee 
has increased solvency to make debt 
payments.
 ✓ A higher percentage of LEED-certified 
buildings are owner occupied, reducing 
risk to the mortgagor.
 ✓ Many analysts believe that the green capi-
tal market is poised to shift very quickly as 
oil prices continue to rise, energy and water 
worries escalate, and skepticism about the 
North American real estate market contin-
ues to grow. (As an added tidbit, share that 
in late 2007, Wells Fargo publicly released a 
statement that it had a cumulative portfolio 
of $1 billion in green commercial loans.)

 Chapter 9: Greening Your Accounting Practices
All about green leases
If you’re truly striving for sustainability, then the 
space your business occupies needs to reflect 
an alignment with your organization’s ecoval-
ues. So hats off to you if you decide to rent a 
green space! Look for the landlord to structure 
the rental agreement in a manner that encour-
ages you to occupy the space in a way that 
aligns with the building’s design strategy.
Building owners and managers are just begin-
ning to create templates for green leases that 
address issues such as:
 ✓ Using and maintaining energy systems in an 
appropriate manner
 ✓ Maintaining indoor air quality by requiring 
natural cleaning products to be used so 
that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are 
kept out of the air flow
 ✓ Promoting tenant recycling
 ✓ Requiring that any leasehold improvements 
(changes to convert the space to a tenant’s 
specific needs) by renters be submitted for 
LEED-CI certification (you can read up on this 
specific LEED certification in Chapter 8)
For an in-depth look at green lease terms, check 
out www.squarefootage.net/pdfs/
articles/8_25_06_Green_Lease.
pdf.
If you’re leasing your business facility and it 
doesn’t incorporate sustainable design, you 
may not be able to renovate, but you can ask for 
specific provisions to ensure that the building 
will be operated in an environmentally sound 
manner. Many landlords of traditional buildings 
are willing to negotiate sustainable lease provi-
sions with the understanding that these issues 
enhance the building’s value and their reputa-
tion as well. Think about the following items 
when negotiating specific facets of your lease:
 ✓ Ask to be submetered for electricity use so 
that savings from green leasehold improve-
ments accrue to you.
 ✓ Create a space (especially if the building is 
made up of shared space) for a recycling 
center.
 ✓ Ask for bike racks and prime parking spots 
for hybrids, electric cars, scooters, and 
motorcycles.
 ✓ Discuss a building upgrade plan and 
investigate whether the landlord is will-
ing to consider phasing in efficient lighting 
or replacing carpets with PVC-free floor 
coverings.
Advocating on behalf of a green lease is usually 
an educational experience. The more you can 
illuminate your landlord, the more likely he or 
she is to see the benefits that accrue to land-
lords as a result of green leases.
 
✓ Brighter Planet Visa: Offered by Bright Planet (in partnership with Bank 
of America), this card is aimed at fighting climate change.
 
✓ GreenCard Visa: Offered by Repay International through its ClimaCount 
program, this card actually calculates the amount of carbon embedded 
in your purchases. Then, for no extra cost, the company offsets those 
emissions by planting trees. You have to pay a one-time start-up fee, 
but after that, you benefit from no annual fees and competitive interest 
rates. The GreenCard Visa recently expanded into the U.S. market from 
its home base in Holland.

Putting Your Money Where Your 
Mouth Is: Investing Responsibly
Your controller or CFO probably has an investment committee that helps 
him or her manage your company’s extra cash. Analyzing your investments 
through an ecolens establishes your company as the real green deal and 
shows that you’re contributing to the trillion-dollar sector known as socially 
responsible investing, which helps grow other green businesses. How’s that 
for triple-bottom-line benefits?
 
Based on the investment parameters that you work with, you may have a little 
or a lot of latitude as to what your company’s investment portfolio can partici-
pate in. At the bare minimum, you should employ negative screens that elimi-
nate any companies or funds related to products or services that
 
✓ Employ child, slave, or penal labor
 
✓ Sell tobacco, pornography, alcohol, or firearms
 
✓ Profit from war or other human misery
 
✓ Have a shoddy environmental history
If your company happens to allow for direct investing in other companies, 
look into businesses that are traded on The Green Exchange or tracked on 
the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Otherwise, green mutual 
funds may be worthwhile for a portion of your business’s portfolio.
Green mutual funds are offering lots of options to invest in products that 
regenerate the environment, eradicate poverty, alleviate global health con-
cerns, or contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Almost all 
major fund families have added at least one sustainability-oriented fund in 
response to investor requests. Of course, doing all the usual research is still 
important, so investigate fees, performance, managers, and the fund’s 
objectives and goals. Comparing socially responsible funds can be a chal-
lenge because in addition to traditional comparative features, you want to 

191
 Chapter 9: Greening Your Accounting Practices
ascertain whether the fund is really as socially responsible as it claims. After 
all, its parameters may not be the same as yours.
Natural Investments’s Social Ratings are helpful for seeing how your prospec-
tive mutual fund rates. Emulating Morningstar’s mutual fund rating based on 
one to five stars, Natural Investments assigns one to five hearts. Ratings can 
be found on the firm’s Web site at www.naturalinvesting.com.
 
Many funds say they’re green without taking the actions necessary to back 
up that statement, so beware of such greenwashing. For example, shunning 
investment in the oil sands of Alberta while propping up a corporation that 
makes gaming machines may not be as socially responsible as you’d prefer.
 
Convert your company’s investment portfolio incrementally. Start with a small 
amount, tightly analyze the investment’s performance, ensure that it’s an 
appropriate mix in your portfolio, and then set target percentages for greening 
your investment portfolio annually.
Accessing Seed Capital for 
Your Sustainability Efforts
If you’re doing something green and innovative, or if you’re in need of funds 
to position your company for a sustainable future, accessing capital pools 
specifically designed for companies that are pursuing sustainability may be 
easier than you think. Businesses rolling out green products, particularly those 
that contribute to solving some of the biggest global challenges, have a unique 
opportunity to access the new capital sources sprouting up everywhere.
External seed capital primarily comes from two sources: venture capitalists 
and green angel investors, both of which I explain in the following sections.
Venture capitalists
A venture capitalist (also known as a VC) is an investment firm or individual 
person that invests in companies poised for high growth or expansion, typically 
in return for a majority ownership. The companies that VCs invest in are past 
the “sweat equity” stage (in which friends, family, and credit cards fund their 
startup) but are too early on to raise capital in public markets. VCs usually look 
for an exit strategy within five years and bring managerial and technical exper-
tise to their investments, typically commanding a significant board presence.
 
Many say that Pratt’s Guide to Private Equity & Venture Capital Sources (pub-
lished by Venture Economics; editions updated annually) is an invaluable 
asset for anyone seeking VC funding, but it’s quite pricy. For a cheaper way of 

192
Part II: Pushing Up Your Green Sleeves: Implementation 
finding VCs who might be interested in funding your operation, try doing an 
Internet search for your specific region and “venture capital.” (If you’re in 
Austin, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; or California’s Silicon Valley, then you’re in 
luck — these areas are home to clusters of intense venture-capital action.) 
Starting with regional firms is often best to cut down on your travel expenses; 
it’s also often easier to sell your story to someone who understands the 
regional market you’re in.
 
Because of the number of unsolicited business plans that many VCs receive, 
consider seeking a reference from a business advisor, such as an accountant, 
attorney, insurance or financial products counselor, or banker, to help get 
your business plan reviewed.
Venture capital conferences bring together a plethora of young companies 
looking for capital with the organizations that fund these sorts of upstarts. 
Conferences can be the result of university collaborations or independent 
endeavors by many VCs that have gotten together in a particular region or 
specific industry sector.
The sheer volume of upcoming venture capital conferences is fairly stag-
gering. See for yourself by visiting www.greenvc.org/conference_and_
events_greentech_cleantech/index.html. The site’s home page is an 
e-letter with scads of info on the clean tech venture capital world. After you 
find a conference you want to target, delve into this Web site to see whether 
there’s a prescreening process for your business plan and whether you need 
to submit an executive summary of your business plan or complete a stan-
dard application because procedures tend to differ by conference.
Green angel investors
Many small communities are finding, to their great surprise and delight, a 
proliferation of green angel investors, philanthropists and investors who pool 
their funds to provide the very earliest seed capital for local green projects. 
This money is finding its way into small social and environmental ventures 
in diverse areas such as local foods, wineries and breweries, healthcare, 
community finance, renewable energy, alternative transportation, and local 
media, to name a few.
 
Unfortunately, green angel investors aren’t organized in an easy-to-search 
database, so if you find one, consider that your lucky day. Although many of 
these people remain fairly low-key, you can try searching for them by tapping 
into every sustainable business network, alliance, and trade association you 
can in your area. These groups are fabulous resources for introductions into 
the world of sustainability, and their events usually feature local fare and fun, 
drawing you ever farther down the path toward sustainability.

Involving 
Stakeholders in 
Your Sustainability 
Efforts

 nvolving all of your company’s stakeholders — con-
sumers, employees, shareholders, and more — is an 
important part of corporate stewardship. Your overall 
marketing strategy dictates how you communicate to 
many of these stakeholders, and educating them through 
your marketing initiatives is a core component of a sus-
tainable business. But you must shift your marketing and 
messaging carefully due to the inordinate amount of mis-
leading green information out there. I guide you through 
that process in this part.
I also show you how to help revitalize your local economy 
by collaborating with other businesses to encourage com-
munity members to buy local for the benefit of everyone 
in your area. And if you’ve never before considered part-
nering with a nonprofit organization as a way to effect 
change in your community, I introduce you to the ecoben-
efits involved in such a relationship. Finally, because 
recruiting, training, retaining, and evaluating your employ-
ees through a green lens depends in large part on your 
Human Resource team’s efforts, here I help you identify 
how to make steps in that direction.

Y
ou’re on track with a sustainability plan and boy are you motivated to let 
the word out that you’re going green! You want to talk about your green 
goods or services, differentiate yourself from the competition, and showcase 
your socially and environmentally responsible operations through your 
marketing message, which you can do through the classic marketing mix.
 
✓ Product: The product you’re providing needs to be convenient, perform 
well, and meet a need.
 
✓ Price: The price needs to reflect your product’s perceived value.
 
✓ Place: The point of purchase must be convenient and accessible for con-
sumers.
 
✓ Promotion: The promotion efforts should encompass your company’s 
brand image and offer product-differentiation messaging.
This four-fold marketing strategy takes on a new look when viewed through 
the lens of sustainability. After you feel confident that you’ve addressed 
all the traditional aspects of the marketing mix, you can begin to focus on 
each aspect with an eye to its green attributes. Sustainable marketing isn’t 
so much about creating a new strategy as it is about considering what you 
already do from a green perspective.

196
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
In doing so, you want to take into account how your customers feel about 
your environmentally friendly business practices, educate consumers enough 
to bring them onboard with your new green product or service line, and 
spread the word about your environmental efforts. Not sure how to proceed? 
Never fear! I clue you in on these tactics and much more in this chapter.
Greening Your Marketing 
Model: The Basics
Taking your business to the next level requires understanding the complexi-
ties of the evolving green marketplace. Although recent marketing surveys 
indicate a definitive shift toward sustainability, many open-ended questions 
still remain as to how to incorporate it into your marketing model.
That’s why you have to consider the following:
 
✓ How green your customer base is and what options your company has 
for going green: Who exactly is a green consumer, and does this person 
come in different shades? What makes a product or service green? What 
sort of premium will consumers pay for these attributes? Where are con-
sumers shopping for sustainable products, and where are they turning 
for sustainable services?
 
✓ What to focus your marketing on: Should you promote your company’s 
social and environmental responsibility efforts, the green products and 
services themselves, or both?
 
✓ How integrally to embed your green messaging within your overall 
marketing plan: Are you trying to find your green self, or do you already 
know you’re 100 percent strategically committed to this initiative? Has 
your board and/or top management issued a “go for it” directive, or are 
you feeling them out?
 
✓ How you’ll communicate your green message: Will you be layering a 
green message on top of your existing marketing efforts or crafting a 
whole new marketing message? Will your labeling and packaging reflect 
a new direction, or are you taking the add-on approach? Should you use 
your traditional labeling and materials but design a defining look for the 
green product line so as to tie the new with the old?
 
However you proceed with greening your marketing model, make sure to 
actively engage in consumer education and outreach in your messaging efforts 
so that your customers see how and why your green product or service offering 
is different and how it’s making a contribution to solving social or environmental 
problems.

197
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
Color-Coding Your Customers 
by Their Shade of Green
Your job when engaging in marketing is to anticipate where consumer 
demand is heading. But to do that, you first need to understand your cus-
tomer base’s current green leanings. Then you must decide whether you’re 
trying to position your green products and services to appeal to the full 
range of potential customers or only the segments already interested in or 
committed to sustainable purchasing. This decision impacts all facets of the 
classic marketing mix: which product to develop, how to price it, where to 
sell it, and how to promote it. (See Chapter 7 for in-depth coverage on the 
product development process.)
 
You can expect to have a smallish percentage of hard-core green consumers 
asking the tough questions and rewarding you with their purchasing power if 
your products or services truly meet their green screen. A larger percentage 
of your customers may fall in the middle ground, a group that enjoys exploring 
the idea of sustainability. A much larger segment of your customer base is 
likely the group that doesn’t remotely identify social or environmental con-
cerns as a relevant part of a purchasing decision. Your job is thus to deter-
mine: Where do your existing consumers lie? Where will you position your 
newly greened products or services?
In the following sections, I delve into ways you can find the answers to these 
questions and outline the most current demographic data about green con-
sumers. With this information, you can begin to get a feel for where your 
existing customer base falls and start thinking about how that relates to your 
planned sustainability initiatives. The challenges you face when determining 
which groups of consumers to target are clear, but the rewards will be well 
worth your efforts if you can craft a strategy that meets the needs of one or 
more of these consumer segments.
Conducting green marketing research
Before you can assign a shade of green to your existing (or desired) customer 
base, you first need to figure out how these people are thinking. Lucky for 
you there are tons of ways to do just that.
If you have the cash but not the time to conduct your own research, you 
may be happy to know that green marketing research is now available for 
purchase. But buying marketing data gets expensive, and with this particular 
market poised to explode, purchasing green data is no exception. To find a 
wide variety of segmented reports, check out the LOHAS Consumer Reports 
at www.lohas.com.

198
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
For a cheaper way to get a feel for green consumers and where your products 
and services may fit best in the market, take advantage of others’ observa-
tions. You can easily do this secondary research by
 
✓ Subscribing to a credible marketing journal, such as the Journal of 
Marketing, where a quick search revealed 17 green articles in the prior 
12 months; or a tightly scoped green marketing journal, such as the 
LOHAS Journal
 
✓ Joining a blog focused on green marketing like sustainablemarketing.
com/blog
 
✓ Perusing a prominent daily newspaper, such as The Wall Street Journal 
or The New York Times online, and searching for green articles
Conducting primary research is an option that allows you to gather either 
qualitative or quantitative data. A good way to gather qualitative consumer 
input is to hold a focus group made up of a slice of your customers (commer-
cial, individual, online, and so on). Focus groups usually consist of approxi-
mately 6 to 12 individuals and a facilitator who administers a set of questions 
and solicits comments and responses from the participants.
 
To get the most from your focus group, consider having participants
 
✓ Define a green product, including identifying specific attributes and 
benefits
 
✓ Denote green features they’d find desirable if added to your current 
product line
 
✓ Identify what premium (as a percentage) they’d be willing to pay for the 
desirable attributes
 
✓ Indicate how they’d like to see your green products positioned in a 
shop — next to other green products or alongside traditional products 
(for the sake of comparison and comfort)
 
✓ Describe their purchasing behaviors toward companies that are perceived 
as being socially responsible (or not!)
Pine Greens: The uber-informed consumer
 
LOHAS (Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability) is the acronym for the esti-
mated 60 to 70 million American consumers who make purchasing decisions 
due to a product’s sustainable or healthful characteristics. Call ’em the Pine 
Greens — individuals who are very well educated about environmental and 
social issues and require honest and comprehensive product information. 
They want data on

199
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
 
✓ How your product is made
 
✓ What type of energy is used to make it
 
✓ How much recycled content is embedded in it
 
✓ What laborers’ working conditions are
 
✓ Whether your product contains toxins, petroleum, or harmful ingredients
 
✓ Whether it is locally grown
 
✓ Whether it is tested on animals
The Pine Greens are the core folks behind the rise in organic foods, ecot-
ourism, hybrid cars, and natural body and bath products. Oddly enough, 
some people in this group don’t actually know they’re in it. In other words, 
I may choose a solar-powered water heater over the conventional alterna-
tive because I’m worried about future energy prices or availability. Although 
I may not consider myself a Pine Green consumer (or even know what the 
heck that means), an underlying reason that I bought the appliance is that it 
relies on renewable energy, and I’m concerned about a volatile energy future.
 
The major marketing challenge is that this group employs a sophisticated pur-
chasing screen and isn’t bogged down by too much information. Au contraire! 
Pine Greens can sniff out a false claim of being green faster than a hound can 
tree a cat. Nor are they interested in the general term green; they want your 
product or service to showcase specific ecoattributes. So the more info you 
have out there about your product, the better for these folks.
Jungle Greens: The trendy, 
ecofriendly consumer
The Jungle Greens are a market ripe for the picking, because they’re inter-
ested but not fully engaged in the sustainability scene. This group perceives 
green as trendy, but may not know exactly why it’s so popular. Generally, 
they’re okay with
 
✓ Doing the supposed “right thing” — as long as it’s easy: Because this 
demographic is heavily weighted in the thirtysomething professional 
category, the Jungle Greens want the convenience of a strip mall, but 
with local products. Think fast-food drive-throughs with tasty organic 
tidbits in compostable packaging.
 
✓ Finding out about what makes a business green: They don’t need any-
thing technical — just some easy-to-read signage. A poster that points 
out the dangers of perchloroethylene (perc) — and by the way, can you 
smell how fresh it is in here? — is perfect in a dry cleaning shop that’s 
trying to go green.

200
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
✓ Paying a premium if you tell ’em why it’s necessary: Your Fair Trade 
Certified coffee may be $1 more expensive per pound than the competi-
tion’s, but if you tell Jungle Greens that the Guatemalan farmers produc-
ing it are making a living wage and sending the first generation of kids in 
that region to school, then you’ve just scored a new customer base.
 
Jungle Greens may have general environmental and social concerns and are 
looking for easy solutions. Your task is to teach them why green is good and 
offer solutions to everyday problems. This group wants to
 
✓ Find out more about your product and its green features
 
✓ Understand the gist of why these features matter
 
✓ See the environmental benefit of purchasing your product and feel that 
it is significant
 
✓ Understand whether the green features change your product’s perfor-
mance
 
✓ Know how to find out more information
 
Above all, you want to help Jungle Greens equate their choices and lifestyle to 
being socially and environmentally responsible. These are smart people, so 
make your product plugs subtle but smart as well.
The primary challenge with this group is convincing Jungle Greens to change 
purchasing patterns that include sacrificing time. Shopping at a farmers’ 
market eats up most of your Saturday morning. But buying green power by 
checking a box online the next time you pay your energy bill is feel-good and 
quick. Although it may mean a 5 to 8 percent increase in monthly energy 
expenditures, it’s exactly the type of behavior change these folks want to 
green-drop into the conversation over pomegranate martinis at happy hour.
Moss Greens: The environmentally 
apathetic consumer
The Moss Greens either believe the seriousness of the environmental state 
of affairs is overplayed or that it’s someone else’s problem to fix. Your chal-
lenge is to convince them that considering green products and services is in 
their best interest.
These folks are primarily concerned with bargains and convenience. Any inter-
est that they have in sustainability is solely tied up in how it impacts their 
finances and their time. It’s not that Moss Greens don’t have a conscience; 
they’re just generally guided in their purchases by the demands of everyday 
existence. Demographics also indicate these folks are clustered quite easily by 
geographic and ethnic concentration, as well as socioeconomic status.

201
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
 
To really sell your product or service to this group, you need to make Moss 
Greens
 
✓ See a true financial benefit to going green: Showing the cash conve-
niences of sustainability is growing easier because increasing energy 
costs are embedded in almost every product or service imaginable. 
Compact fluorescent light bulbs, cold water detergents, and hand-push 
mowers are flying off the shelves everywhere. Focus on cost savings, but 
engage in education at the same time, because deep down even the most 
frugal consumer wants to be part of saving the planet.
 
✓ Understand what they may be losing or missing out on by not already 
using your product or service: Moss Greens don’t seek out environmen-
tally related details, so if you want them to know that your green clean-
ing products make a home smell citrusy (instead of like a high school 
chem lab) and that they keep customers from having to worry about 
babies and pets being affected by those hard-to-pronounce toxic compo-
nents, then you have to get out there and tell them that.
 
✓ Recognize that obtaining your product or service is as convenient as 
purchasing traditional products: This consumer group isn’t going to go 
out of its way to find sustainable products or services. You need to bring 
Spotting common ground among green consumers
An abundance of green market research data 
is out there, along with numerous ways to slice 
and dice consumer profiles. Attempts to apply 
standard demographic analysis often fall short 
of the mark, because green consumers are 
found across all typical segments, such as age, 
religion, income, and geography. So take any 
analysis you find concerning green consumer 
demographics for what it is — a blurry snap-
shot of an evolving scene.
However, a few interesting commonalities 
within the green marketplace have been 
reported:
 ✓ Women are much more likely than men 
to respond to environmentally charged 
marketing campaigns.
 ✓ “Wanting to make a difference” ranks 
consistently high as a driving force behind 
buying green. People feel overwhelmed 
with environmental and societal problems 
and see using their cash as a tangible way 
to be a part of the solution.
 ✓ Overall willingness to pay a premium for 
green products is growing, but a disparity 
still exists between how much consumers 
say they’re willing to pay for green products 
and how much they actually cough up at 
the cash register.
Studies show that although consumers are 
increasingly indicating an interest in green 
goods and services, many can’t explain what 
green is. But guess what? This finding shows 
you have tremendous marketing and educa-
tional opportunities as you dive into the world 
of green business.

202
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
’em to them. Locate your green goods or services in a convenient outlet 
where Moss Greens are already stopping for other items (think big-box, 
one-stop store).
 
Because competitive cost is your biggest challenge with Moss Greens, you 
need to be very sure they understand that a price point above that of non-
green products actually yields them proportionate savings in the long run. So 
instead of merely saying, “You’ll spend 30 percent less on electricity over the 
life of this dishwasher,” translate that savings into how much money the end 
user will save monthly on his or her electric bill. After factoring in these elec-
tricity savings, the consumer should net a savings when comparing payments 
on your dishwasher to payments on your competitor’s.
Using the buy-local and buy-organic movements 
to your marketing advantage
Often your ecominded customers face a 
dilemma when packing up the hybrid car and 
heading out for a day of shopping: Buy local or 
buy organic? To solve this conundrum, they try 
to determine whether it’s more important to
 ✓ Keep dollars circulating in the local econ-
omy, even though the product may not be 
certified as organic or sustainable by a 
third party
 ✓ Buy sustainably certified products that are 
being mass marketed at big-box stores
How you make use of your customers’ buy-
local versus buy-organic dilemma depends 
on whether you’re involved in a franchise or 
global business or you’re a small business 
owner. Obviously, you can’t claim to be a local 
store if you’re owned by a conglomerate in 
Holland, but you can feature local products 
in your store (if your franchise allows it). Buy-
local campaigns are growing in numbers and 
influence, and the concept of building regional 
self-reliance is a strong marketing thread for 
many local businesses.
For example, food is, of course, the biggest buy-
local push in North America today. Restaurants, 
coffee shops, and even whole events featur-
ing local food are growing in number and 
visibility. If you’re undertaking marketing for a 
food-centered organization, you should have a 
keen understanding that folks want assurance 
of the origination of their foodstuffs. After all, 
recent studies show that the 16 most common 
crops grown in a Midwestern state travel about 
1,500 miles as an import to chain groceries in 
that state. Consequently, the average item on 
your dinner plate, even if it was grown in your 
home state, has journeyed out of state to a 
processing plant, then to a distribution center 
elsewhere, and then back to the place you pur-
chased it from near your home. So even when 
you buy local, the item you buy may still have 
traveled a long way to get to you! Imagine being 
a Nebraskan sitting down to a dinner of Chilean 
beef. Weird, huh?

203
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
Balancing Premium Pricing 
with Consumer Demand
A great deal of confusion tends to surround the question of how products 
that contain less (think fewer pesticides, no preservatives, less packaging, 
and the like) can possibly cost more. The quick-and-dirty answer is that many 
sustainable products aren’t mass-produced or mass-marketed, so the over-
head captured in them may be significantly more on a per-unit basis. This 
fact requires you to educate your consumers at every turn so that they know 
why they’re paying more for your product or service.
Say you sell kids’ clothing and lots of these clothes are made from cotton, 
one of the most heavily fertilized and water-intensive crops known to man-
kind. Oh yeah, and lots of cotton is picked by young children in the develop-
ing world who are, well, picking cotton rather than going to school. So you 
decide to carry an organic line of cotton clothing, grown and harvested in the 
country. The problem is that your new trendy tots line prices out at about 45 
percent more than the not-so-earth-friendly alternatives. Is that necessarily 
bad? Breathe deep and repeat after me: “No, it’s not.”
 
Although many people say they’ll pay a premium for a green product, most 
can’t name a single brand that they consider to be green. Add that to the fact 
that the only consistent thread in green marketing surveys is that consumers 
insist they want to make a difference with their purchases. The result? You 
now have an awesome opportunity to build an image in consumers’ minds 
that your products and services are green and that purchasing them posi-
tively impacts the world.
When introducing a new green product or service, your marketing approach 
should be to make sure your messaging conveys quality while giving you an 
opportunity to educate consumers on the environmental pluses of choosing 
the very features that make your product or service sustainable. You may 
be a bit worried about pushing your product because your customers are 
price conscious, and you don’t honestly know whether they’re full-fledged 
Pine Greens or not (here’s where doing your market research helps; see the 
earlier section “Color-Coding Your Customers by Their Shade of Green” for 
more info).
 
Don’t try to explain the premium away. Instead, showcase the product or ser-
vice as part of a new and forward-thinking line that complements what you 
already carry or provide by doing the following:

204
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
✓ Place a placard spotlighting the issue next to your in-store display. 
The placard should be pretty simple and highlight the main green attri-
butes of the product or service and the connection to why those are 
good. Signage decrying “Made with 50-percent renewable energy” should 
be tied to verbiage like “Climate-friendly” or “Do your part in reducing 
global warming.” If you’re in the food business, you may prefer sig-
nage that states “Slate harvested within 50-mile radius,” which links to 
“Providing jobs for your neighbors” or “Less distance — less fuel — less 
cost – more Earth-friendly.” The purpose of your placard is to make the 
connection for your customers.
 
✓ Highlight your new product or service in your monthly newspaper 
spot or your electronic newsletter. Education is the key here as well. 
Don’t just tout the green features of your product. Use your precious 
promotional space to concisely convey how the green attributes of 
your product or service make a positive impact on the environment in 
easy-to-remember bullets. This isn’t the place for displaying lengthy cli-
mate change stats, but it is the place for dropping tidbits on sustainable 
bamboo harvesting and its impact on the habitat of panda bears.
 
✓ Encourage your employees to tell the product or service’s story to 
browsing consumers. Of course, it helps if your employees are well edu-
cated about your product or service. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve 
been eager to learn about bamboo ( a highly renewable floor covering) 
or inquired about a locally made artisanal cheese only to have a disinter-
ested employee grunt, “I dunno,” in response to my question.
You can’t be all things to all people, but if consumers associate paying a 
premium with making a difference, you’ve established yourself as a business 
that understands sustainability and market trends. Pat yourself on the back 
for that one!
Recognizing That Placement 
Is Paramount
Where your sustainable products are distributed is an incredibly important 
factor in getting your green products to market. Although the actual distribu-
tion of them is logistically a supply chain management function, determining 
distribution channels is primarily a marketing decision. You need to consider 
whether you (as the producer) are going to market your green goods straight 
to consumers or whether you’re going to move your items through a retailer 
or wholesaler-retailer partnership. I share what you need to keep in mind 
during this decision-making process in the following sections.

205
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
Channeling sustainable products 
through a retailer
Distributing your product through a retailer is a common way to reach 
consumers in a comfortable and traditional manner, but it’s only effective 
if you find the right retailer to work with, leaving you with some options to 
consider. Are you going all-out green by marketing your holistic pet food 
products exclusively through a natural foods store, or do you think that a tra-
ditional, intensive distribution mode is best?
 
Try to find a connection that gives a retailer a reason to carry your product 
line. For instance, your green wedding products may fit nicely with the local 
floral shop, or your organic table linens may provide a natural enhancement at 
an organic foods store. Don’t forget to look into mainstream stores that are 
featuring sustainable counterparts to existing products.
 
Focusing on the retail locations where your target customers are more likely 
to shop is another good move. Although little formal research is available on 
this topic, you can rest assured that the Pine Greens congregate at the pure-
green retailers, whereas the Moss Greens frequent the chain stores. Jungle 
Greens go either way, with higher-income consumers gravitating toward pure-
green and hybrid retailers and those with lighter wallets visiting the chain 
stores in search of organic foods, textiles, and toys.
Check out the next several sections for help making your decision on which 
distributor is most appropriate for your product and target market.
Distributing through pure-green retailers
Many dedicated green retailers, both online and storefront, have emerged in 
response to the growing green market. Additionally, many stores featuring 
natural landscaping products, sustainably harvested home furnishings and 
textiles, and the like are receptive to products that embody green living. You 
just have to figure out how to get into them.
Pine Green consumers, motivated by the desire to purchase healthful and 
sustainable items, actively seek out organizations that feature products 
and services that reflect their values. If you anticipate these folks being a 
key component of your market, check out some of the existing online-based 
green retailers. Pick up a copy of the green version of The Purple Book (not-
so-surprisingly found at www.thepurplebook.com) for a comprehensive 
overview of ecofriendly online shopping.
Distributing through hybrid retailers
Hybrid retailers are those traditional retail outlets that have branched out to 
distribute some green product lines. They don’t deal in green goods exclu-
sively, which in my opinion makes them prime hunting grounds for Jungle 

206
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Green shoppers. Your choices, and they certainly aren’t mutually exclusive, 
for distributing sustainable goods to the Jungle Greens are
 
✓ General online merchandisers that feature a green section within their 
existing lineup
 
✓ General retailers that integrate green products with existing products
 
✓ General retailers that segregate green products into discrete sections of 
the store
If you already have existing relationships with these retailers, that will get 
you in the door to talk about your new sustainable product line. Many tradi-
tional retailers that are looking at greener business models themselves are 
actively prospecting for innovative green products and would be happy to 
hear your pitch.
Distributing through the big-box chain stores
Many big-box stores are now developing their own green lines to ecocomple-
ment existing products. Because of their bargain prices and easy acces-
sibility, these ultra-large, big-box stores provide the only likely outlet for 
capturing the Moss Greens. And with the tightening of many consumers’ bud-
gets, you may even find more Jungle Greens knocking at these doors as well.
Of course, you can always try to influence change by pitching your product 
to the big-box big guys (see the nearby sidebar for tips). If your product is 
made in the local area or in the country, however, you may be excited to 
know that some chain stores are allocating square footage to locally made 
products. Firsthand research is really important in this category, so rely on 
your own observations. The folks that manage these stores respond to con-
sumer interest by carrying products to meet these demands.
Look for evidence that the shift toward sustainability has begun in your 
community by being observant as you make your daily forays into shops. 
Ask questions everywhere you go and engage managers and employees in 
dialogue. For example, while the employee at the seafood counter wraps up 
your fresh fish, inquire about Marine Stewardship Council Certified seafood 
and ask whether a mercury content chart is posted somewhere. Popping 
into a home improvement shop? Ask whether it carries ecofriendly paints 
and “smart strip” power strips. Believe me, the more customers inquire 
about sustainability-related items, the wider the door will open for green 
goods and services.
 
Repeat requests for sustainable alternatives can make an impact. If you 
want to receive more calls from big-box stores for distributing your prod-
uct, encourage friends and family to remind their favorite large retailer that 
they were the ones asking for the toxin-free glue or 100-percent organic 
hand towels.

207
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
Selling directly to consumers
If you directly channel your products and services to consumers — through a 
storefront, catalogue operation, or online shop — you have a particular abil-
ity to control your customer relationships. Such control is rather attractive 
from an educational perspective because you have a dedicated opportunity 
to develop your consumers’ green knowledge. As is true of almost all aspects 
of a green business, some rule-bending comes into play regarding the innova-
tive ideas emerging in product placement for sustainable items.
Pitching your product to the big-box bigwigs
If you have an idea, product line, or prototype 
and want to get it in the hands of big-box retail-
ers, start by searching your target nationwide or 
global company’s Web site for a sustainability 
creed, a policy on corporate social responsibil-
ity, or a job title in the organizational chart like
 ✓ Sustainability Director
 ✓ VP of Corporate Social Responsibility
 ✓ Environmental Management Officer
Often the job of screening green products and 
processes for inclusion in the chain’s lineup 
goes to these big shots. Remember: Persistence 
is the key here. Don’t be put off by their sec-
retary telling you that the retailer doesn’t take 
new, unsolicited product ideas. Instead, con-
duct a search on its Web site for press releases 
related to “green” or “sustainability” and see 
who the internal corporate players are so you 
can contact them directly. See whether the 
retailer has any job postings for interns or posi-
tions related to sustainability and follow that 
line. Companies are seeking out ways to go 
green — convince them you’re a part of their 
solution!
Some of these companies are releasing vision-
ary plans for future stores, like including wind 
turbines in parking lots to harvest clean energy 
and charge the batteries of customers’ electric 
cars while they shop. Your job? Convince these 
big-box retailers that your ecoconscious prod-
uct line is exactly what they’re looking for.
When pitching your product, make sure you’re 
clear on the exact green product attributes 
you’re offering. Do your homework on how 
your product compares to its traditional coun-
terparts for price point, performance, and con-
venience. A short and concise presentation 
should include a
 ✓ Quick lesson in green demographics. 
Consider sharing the info in the earlier 
“Color-Coding Your Customers by Their 
Shade of Green” section and definitely 
throw out the current size of the LOHAS 
(Pine Green) market and its growth expec-
tations.
 ✓ Snapshot of which group your product is 
positioned to target.
 ✓ Value comparison between your product 
and the primary competitors.
 ✓ Wrap-up that features a quick reference 
to how the business case for sustainability 
means a partnership between your com-
pany and the big-box retailer makes sense 
for the triple bottom line. (Refer to Chapter 
1 for thorough coverage of this topic.)

208
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
Although no longer epitomized by two neighbors chatting across a fence, 
word-of-mouth advertising is still an incredibly effective way to market. In fact, 
many companies hoping to spread their green message are using YouTube, 
blogs, social networking Web sites, and environmentally and socially oriented 
online forums to generate a buzz about their sustainable behaviors and prod-
ucts. Companies are banding together online to offer free samples of green 
products, highlight ethical behaviors, share knowledge, and draw attention to 
companies engaged in greenwashing (stating that they’re green without taking 
the actions necessary to back up that statement). So if you dabble in this prac-
tice, watch out because dodgy claims will only be exposed more frequently on 
consumer blogs and Web sites as time marches on.
Rethinking your inventory: Do you need 
one of everything to make the sale?
 
One of the prevalent ideas behind sustainability is using fewer resources to 
accomplish the same results. To this end, interest is growing in heating, cool-
ing, and lighting small, smartly designed storefronts that showcase only one 
or two items of each featured product rather than maintaining square footage 
sufficient to carry an entire product line.
If you have a full product line, ask yourself whether you really need to carry 
inventory representing every item in every conceivable color and size. 
Instead, consider inventive ways to sell your product in a smaller environ-
ment. For example, in an ecochic boutique, the customer may touch, try on, 
cuddle with, or generally connect with the tangible item. Then an in-house 
interactive digital display illustrates the sizes, styles, and colors that the 
product’s available in. The customer can order on the spot and receive the 
product by mail.
Slashing your on-hand inventory may be appropriate for your business if
 
✓ The items you sell aren’t something your customer needs to use right now
 
✓ A small number of higher-end pieces allows your customer to get a feel 
for your full range of products
 
✓ Your distribution facility’s costs and natural resource efficiency are sig-
nificantly lower than your retail counterparts
Determining where to locate your display space: 
To integrate, or to segregate?
Where you place your product display within a store goes a long way toward 
arousing consumers’ interest. After all, securing placement for your products 
in retail outlets, as well as cyberspace, is a significant part of the success or 
demise of a product.

209
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
When marketing green goods, you have three options:
 
✓ Design a separate, segregated green spot to showcase sustainable 
products.
 
✓ Integrate your sustainable products with existing product lines.
 
✓ Engage in a hybrid of the two tactics.
Table 10-1 provides further insight into what you get out of segregating or 
integrating your selling space.
Table 10-1 
Segregation versus Integration and the 
 
Potential Effect on Green Goods’ Sales
Segregation
Integration
You have lots of educational opportunities 
to showcase your company’s social and 
environmental responsibility, along with 
the products themselves.
Customers don’t have to actively 
seek out a new area of the store; 
they’ll probably just happen through 
the area where your green goods 
are being sold.
Customers are enticed to check out the 
new kid on the block, and it may feel like 
an adventure to visit this area of the store. 
The look, feel, and labeling information will 
probably be brand-new to many of your 
customers.
You don’t have to worry about 
displays looking unfamiliar and 
being ignored.
Green products can stand on their own 
merit, giving consumers a chance to 
process the benefits they may be buying 
for the premium price.
Consumers can compare 
sustainable products to their 
traditional counterparts on a 
side-by-side basis.
Photo shoots for marketing pieces are 
easy to do.
If you have limited store space, you 
don’t have to worry about coming 
up with a dedicated green area.
 
Individual experiences are very valuable when trying to explore the pros and 
cons of integration versus segregation. Some members of your focus group 
(see the “Conducting green marketing research” section earlier in this chapter 
for the basics on focus groups) may have favorite stores with wonderful areas 
devoted to sustainable products that they seek out purposefully. Others may 
want to see solar tubes in the same section as incandescent lighting so they 
can compare features and pricing. At any rate, you’re guaranteed to capture a 
wide range of opinions from the members of your focus group. Just remember 
that it’s your job to translate the findings from your focus group into a product-
placement plan for your sustainably oriented merchandise.

210
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Product placement is something to think out very carefully. As you go about 
your daily life, check out how sustainable products are displayed, particu-
larly in supermarkets and building supply stores. Does your supermarket dis-
play its organic produce separately or side by side? Are the low-VOC paints 
displayed next to the traditional paints at your local hardware store? If they 
are, is the price differential great enough to scare off all but the most dedi-
cated green consumers?
You can create a lot of value by educating your customers about the merits 
of green products, but in order to do so, you have to get them to read the 
label, check out the locally made placard, or ask why your green product’s 
worth the extra money when they just want to get a job done.
 
I believe that the best way to sell your customers on your green product is to 
get them immersed in the experience of a green product display area that 
engages them in touching products, reading educational materials, and finding 
out the story behind your innovative new product line. For suggestions on 
how to accomplish this task, see “Balancing Premium Pricing with Consumer 
Demand” earlier in this chapter.
Considering rebranding
Outlining the objectives of your green mes-
sage is critical if you want consumers to get it. 
Is your goal to introduce a product, showcase 
your sustainability plan, or change your market-
ing strategy completely? When you’ve reached 
the point of rebranding, you’ve ascertained that 
there’s no time like the present to show your 
sustainable side. Now all you need to do is 
convince your consumers that you have the 
solutions to what they need.
The purpose of branding (name, mark, or logo) 
is to create a distinctive identity for your firm 
and to secure brand loyalty from your custom-
ers. You can identify your entire group of prod-
ucts, as well as your company, as green in a 
comprehensive approach, or you can individu-
ally brand your green products without a full 
company-wide rebranding endeavor.
When considering whether rebranding is right 
to better promote your product or service, you 
may find that you want to go all the way — 
differentiating your company and its operations 
and products by going all green. Or you may 
feel more comfortable transitioning slowly into 
the green market. At any rate, I’m willing to bet 
you can explore expansion into more sustain-
able product lines within your own business, 
because many industry sectors are experienc-
ing an explosion in the green niche of larger, 
established markets. Just try doing an Internet 
search for your product line and sustainabil-
ity. You’ll be surprised to see what surfaces. 
Try “shoes and sustainability” or “weddings 
and sustainability” or “roofing materials and 
sustainability” — well, you get the point!
Warning: Deciding whether to take the green 
rebranding plunge can easily be one of your 
most critical decisions because doing so 
also has big risks. If you’re going whole-hog 
green, make sure that your intent is to stay the 
sustainable course. A gigantic oil company

Promoting Your Green Product or Service
In the broadest sense, getting your green message out there should be geared 
toward developing and maintaining a positive relationship between your 
company and its stakeholders. Note that I didn’t just say customers. Your 
marketing endeavors should facilitate warm fuzzies with all sorts of groups 
from investors and customers to employees and community organizations. 
Ensuring that your message is forthright (“We’re just starting on this new 
sustainability thing”) and resonates with credibility (“This is a path we’re on, 
and we’ve got a lot of learning to do”) is important.
recently engaged in a nine-figure green energy 
rebranding campaign, only to find that when 
the original visionary leader stepped down and 
was replaced, the company’s focus reverted 
back to petroleum. The adverse press has been 
crippling.
Branding far surpasses simply showcasing 
your products or company; it embodies all 
perceptions that cause consumers to form 
expectations and mental associations about 
your organization. Heady stuff, huh? Decisions 
to reinvent your brand image should thus never 
be taken lightly.
Some very high-profile companies in industry 
sectors as diverse as autos, consumer prod-
ucts, and energy are rebranding themselves as 
environmentally and socially astute, complete 
with new logos, slogans, and marketing blitzes. 
Such comprehensive rebranding is only appro-
priate if these circumstances are in place:
 ✓ You have strong commitment from your 
board and executive management team. 
For a sizable company, this sort of endeavor 
usually emanates from a farsighted leader 
willing to convince shareholders and the 
public that his or her vision will take the 
company into the future. Small or privately 
owned companies in this category don’t 
have as many stakeholders to pull along, 
so often personal charisma and vision drive 
the marketing and branding efforts.
 ✓ You have a significant allocation of finan-
cial resources to comprehensively green 
your product line and internal operations. 
Rebranding your business as green may 
well require hiring an outside company 
to guide you through the PR aspect of the 
rebranding process, something that’s a bit 
beyond most companies’ internal scope.
Remember: Quite a few different internal pro-
cedures and processes require an overhaul to 
match up to the mission of corporate sustain-
ability. After all, finding new ways of doing 
business — reconfiguring delivery routes to 
minimize fuel usage or finding new sustain-
able vendors, just to name two — doesn’t just 
happen overnight. So as you weigh the pros 
and cons of rebranding, keep in mind that test-
ing the green waters within your industry sector 
by rolling out a few green products or services 
and assessing customer response is perfectly 
acceptable.
Rebranding your entire organization as green 
can have some big rewards. If you’re already 
a recognized brand, your rebranding effort 
should be harmonious with the current per-
ception of your organization. Rebranding in 
this manner helps consumers judge your new 
products based on their experiences with your 
prior products. Some of the rewards you may 
receive for your efforts include being seen as 
a forerunner in the sustainable movement and 
being able to clearly differentiate your business 
from the competition.

212
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
One of the essential elements of starting down the green path is to repeatedly 
communicate your ecoinitiatives, big and small alike. Many companies balk at 
this step, thinking that what they’re doing is insignificant or uninteresting to 
shareholders, vendors, and customers. Nothing could be farther from the 
truth. In fact, increasingly these groups are looking at the greenness of your 
company before they make the decision to do business with you.
In the next few sections, I reveal how to spread the word positively and avoid 
green marketing pitfalls.
Deciding what to focus on
Educating your consumers about what you’re doing to make your com-
pany carbon neutral or more socially responsible isn’t going to happen by 
Saturday, because it’s an evolutionary process. But as your firm balances 
economic return with social responsibility, you’ll notice that increased prof-
its, media recognition, and satisfied customers and employees are but a few 
of the benefits of pursuing sustainability.
Whether you’re showcasing corporate social responsibility or environmentally 
friendly products and services, use the activities you’re already engaging in as a 
jumping-off point (and score some great PR to boot). For example, let everyone 
know that your Employee of the Year award includes a 12-month free train or 
bus pass. Or use trade shows as an opportunity to distribute recycled or locally 
made items featuring your logo. Believe me, these items stand out in a sea of 
disposable, logo-laden, plastic throwaways and reinforce your green image.
 
Stating ambitious goals is fine, but make sure to focus on what you’ve actually 
accomplished today versus what’s in the hopper. Keep your customers posted 
on your progress. Celebrate your successes, focus on areas of improvement, 
and always be truthful.
The following sections offer some tips on how to effectively maximize your 
message, depending on your focus.
Playing up product attributes
As you work with suppliers to build a product line that sustains natural and 
human resources, educating consumers along the way is critical. Present 
human and environmental health impacts in a nonjudgmental way. Don’t 
patronize or lecture. Instead, help your customers understand why the 
laptop without heavy metals is the obvious choice for their middle-schooler. 
Bring them down the ecopath with you by enticing them with the tidbits of 
knowledge embedded in your message.

213
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
 
The kind of clear-cut product differentiation that you’re after revolves around 
promoting what makes you different from other products that essentially do 
the same thing. Focus on the following:
 
✓ Educating consumers about the connection between your product and 
how it lowers their costs
 
✓ Encouraging your customers to question whether the features they love 
about their favorite nongreen products are really better compared to 
your environmentally healthy offering
 
✓ Identifying your product’s attributes that stand out from a competitor’s 
that customers don’t see as terribly different
 
✓ Underscoring the harmony between your company’s social or environ-
mental responsibility and your finished product
 
In playing up your product’s attributes, you want to be making a link in your 
customers’ minds between your product and the triple bottom line. As identi-
fied in Chapter 1, the triple bottom line refers to maximizing the benefits of 
your business decisions on people, the planet, and your profit.
For example, say your focus group results show that all that polystyrene pack-
aging your frames come in just gets thrown away. So you decide to convert to 
recycled, unbleached cardboard for protective-packaging purposes. An insert 
in each frame box can then highlight the key points — that you’ve changed up 
your packaging, that this move is good for the environment, and that your cus-
tomers can do their own research to find out more about sustainable packaging:
Our new packaging contains 80 percent fewer resources. Packaging is 
a major source of landfill waste. Reduced packaging helps us keep our 
prices low. Packaging has no impact on performance. Check out www.
sustainablepackaging.org for more info.
 
Be careful with your messaging if you’re rolling out a green alternative to an 
existing product or service. After all, you don’t want to compromise the posi-
tion of your current products or services. For example, if your print shop 
introduces a green alternative, will you risk making your regular printing ser-
vices look downright irresponsible because you don’t offer 100-percent post-
consumer-waste paper, recyclable bindings, and nonvolatile inks on all jobs? 
Be clear on what benefits the green option provides and carefully track your 
consumers’ responses.
Conveying corporate social responsibility
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to an organization’s attempt to 
balance the needs of all its stakeholders while enhancing commercial suc-
cess. CSR was once purely synonymous with corporate philanthropy, but in 
today’s reality, charitable giving is only a blip on the CSR screen. Aside from 
direct giving, CSR refers to a company’s efforts at promoting community 

214
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
development, enhancing stakeholders’ quality of life, contributing to a sound 
ethical marketplace, and building a strong environment. Proponents of CSR 
also point out that as businesses craft solid ethical foundations, government 
is less likely to intervene and regulate behaviors.
 
From a marketing perspective, CSR is a brand-differentiation tactic. It’s all about 
what sets you aside from the other roofers, hair stylists, or grocers in your area. 
Building your business based on strong ethical values, although an intangible 
asset for sure, adds value in many ways. So focus your CSR messaging on
 
✓ Linking your company with corporate concern for employee and envi-
ronmental health and community involvement
 
✓ Letting consumers know that your business is committed to transpar-
ency and making progress in areas that need work
 
✓ Establishing a strong link between the economic and social facets of the 
triple bottom line
 
✓ Offering specific sustainability traits of both your product or service and 
your operations by letting the public know that your company’s differ-
ent and explaining why that’s the case
 
Whatever your marketing focus is, ensure that it’s congruent with your inter-
nal, employee-oriented messaging. Although your short-term thinking is small, 
your long-term plans are larger, so you want all of your media (both internal 
and external) to tie together.
Lending validity to your message 
with ecolabeling certification
What’s natural about a chicken whose beak has been removed, or what 
makes the phosphate-based detergent in a PVC-laced container planet 
friendly? These are valid consumer questions that clearly require truth-in-
advertising guidelines as well as (in some cases) third-party certification.
Ecolabeling certification, which conveys compliance with various organi-
zations’ environmental and/or social standards, looks to become a real 
hotbed of activity in the future. As companies increasingly tout their social 
and environmental responsibility and resulting product attributes, collec-
tive consumer suspicion heightens. Advocacy groups anxious to curb false 
green marketing, fickle consumers, and organizations dedicated to corporate 
accountability, among others, are aspiring to develop various ecolabeling 
certification schemes.
For a quick-and-dirty look at the groups working to standardize claims like 
“energy efficient,” “ecofriendly,” and “sustainably harvested,” as well as the 
various ecolabels these organizations provide, check out Table 10-2.

If you decide to go the ecolabeling route, be an involved participant with the 
sponsoring organization. Pooled resources spent on a cruelty-free or buy-local 
campaign have the potential to yield big green — in more ways than one! You 
can also rest assured that banding together with like-minded organizations 
offers more media and marketing opportunities, including lots of educational 
and promotional activities, than what you can accomplish on your own.
Some research suggests that consumers may already be struggling with 
green fatigue, so make sure to frame your message in a way that ties in your 
claims with believable and provable statements. For example, although 
Energy Star is a bona fide EPA ecocertification given to appliances and homes 
that meet certain standards, claiming that something is “Energy Smart” 
means nothing.
 
Touting recyclability is another green marketing boon. If you want to promote 
your product or its packaging as recyclable or reusable, let your consumers 
know about that characteristic in an easy way by imprinting a recycling 
symbol on the product packaging and in your marketing materials.
Optimizing effectiveness 
with a positive tone
The way in which you say something makes all the difference in what your 
listener hears. With all the news about global warming, the disappearance of 
natural resources, and the overfilling of landfills, some consumers may easily 
take your green message as a slap on the wrist or a guilt trip rather than the 
empowering and educational sales pitch you want it to be. That’s why com-
municating your green message in a positive way is paramount.
Your challenge? Being optimistic and realistic all at once. Building credibility 
involves transparency, and that includes acknowledging your shortcomings. 
However, the fact that you’re fleshing out solutions to those issues is what 
sets you apart.
 
✓ Craft a green vision statement and offer it up for all to see.
 
✓ Let folks know if you’re accessing outside standards to guide your green 
journey. (See Chapter 14 for the most widely recognized agencies offer-
ing sustainability standards.)
 
✓ Provide concrete examples that your company and/or specific products 
are getting greener. Always emphasize that it’s a journey; you’re not 
there yet, but you’re working on it.
 
✓ Highlight how your internal actions reinforce the message of sustainability 
(your new recycling plan, purchasing 20-percent locally generated wind 
power, and the like).

Table 10-3 highlights some of the steps you should and shouldn’t take when 
talking to your customers.
Table 10-3 
The Do’s and Don’ts of Positive 
 
Green Communication
Do
Don’t
Accentuate the positive aspect of 
environmental and social stewardship.
Play to the fear factor of environmental 
disaster or social calamity.
Showcase your company’s or 
product’s accomplishments.
Overstate your undertakings.
Engage in education and outreach.
Ply consumers with a full social and 
environmental manifesto.
Talk about why your green products 
or services are superior.
Talk about how horrible traditional 
counterpart products are.
Bring your consumers into the fold 
with a “we can make a difference 
together” type of approach.
Preach to your customers.
 
Never underestimate your customers. Even though they may not have a high 
level of sophistication with green product attributes or triple-bottom-line 
theory, they do know when they’re being fed a line. If the ’70s taught society 
anything, other than how bad disco could really be, it was that false environ-
mental claims (like stating something is biodegradable when it actually has 
polystyrene content) are bad PR and can be potentially fatal for a company’s 
greening efforts.
Building consumers’ trust
 
To build customers’ trust in your product or service, be sure to always tell the 
truth when it comes to your green business practices. Your company’s mar-
keting materials should reflect your commitment to sustainability and should 
never make claims that can’t be substantiated or that exaggerate the impact of 
a program you’ve implemented.
 
The fastest way to turn off customers is to raise suspicions that you aren’t 
really doing what you say you are. Self-identifying as a green corporation or 
claiming to be the model of corporate social responsibility are difficult asser-
tions to uphold. Releasing ads featuring a new sustainable product line or 

219
 Chapter 10: Marketing to a Greener World
highlighting sponsorship of employee diversity training is much more believ-
able. These tactics show that you’re on the same striving-to-be-greener journey 
as your customers.
You also want to be sure to practice what you preach, in all situations. If you 
want to discourage consumers from purchasing your competitor’s product 
by spilling the beans that the competitor leaves a high carbon footprint, (the 
environmental impact defined by the amount of greenhouse gases emitted 
by an entity), be sure you know your own company’s carbon footprint first. 
Or when attending environmental events to promote your service, consider 
showing up in an environmentally friendly vehicle or on a bike rather than in 
a super-sized SUV.
 
Affairs like trade shows are a bit tougher, because you don’t get to control the 
logistics of the event — you just show up. But in this situation, ensure that any 
giveaways imprinted with your name (think pens and shopping totes) are utili-
tarian and made of recycled materials.
If you aren’t careful to always communicate the truth and practice what you 
preach, you can fall into the trap of greenwashing all too easily. Greenwashing 
comes in several shapes and forms:
 
✓ Actively misrepresenting your company’s environmental or social 
behaviors or products.
 
✓ Telling outright lies or blatantly exaggerating the positive impact of your 
product or service on the environment.
 
✓ Offering hazy product descriptions, like “holistic” or “natural” that leave 
consumers confused.
 
✓ Making a naturally dangerous product appear healthy. Can you say 
organic cigarettes?
 
✓ Leaving key info out of the picture, such as not mentioning that although 
your hybrid SUV gets 17 miles to the gallon rather than 14, categorizing 
any gas-guzzler as ecofriendly is still very difficult.
 
As sustainability continues to grow as a trendy proposition, the inclination to 
greenwash consumers will only increase. Not only is greenwashing bad karma, 
but trying to pull the ecofriendly wool over increasingly savvy consumers’ 
eyes can only hurt your credibility in the long term. Report after report shows 
that the public would much rather know about what your challenges are on 
the road to corporate social responsibility than have you gloss over them.

Highlighting Overall Sustainability 
Results in Your Marketing Materials
Your marketing materials (brochures, tip sheets, Web pages, flyers, and so 
on) are excellent ways to educate consumers and showcase your sustainabil-
ity results. Consider the trusty brochure as an example. This is the place to 
synthesize some of the key points from your sustainability report in a clear, 
understandable, bulleted list–type format.
 
Like your sustainability report (which I give you the tools to compile in 
Chapter 16), your marketing material should be suited for all the folks who are 
new to sustainability. The kinds of factors it should address are:
 
✓ What are your core commitments, specifically as they pertain to the 
triple bottom line? You want your marketing pieces to be educational, 
and the easy way to do that is to tell folks how your greening efforts have 
improved people, planet, and profit. How are you specifically attempting 
to reduce your carbon footprint and combat social inequalities?
 
✓ How are you doing with achieving objectives in each of these areas? 
Choose a few highlights and don’t overwhelm your readers with a ton of 
scientific benchmarks or compliance standards. Tell them, for example, 
that you set a goal of increasing the diversity of management recruits 
to emulate the region in which you operate. Then present a very simple 
table showing demographic breakdown versus your employment data. 
Maybe include some bullets underneath your table to indicate how you 
plan on improving next year.
You also want to guarantee your pieces are eye-catching yet informative. You 
can achieve that by
 
✓ Publishing photographs: Pictures can easily clarify ecoconcepts that 
may be more difficult to understand with words alone. If you want to 
tout the living machine at your factory, be sure to show it because 
simply describing sewage-loving bacteria and hydroponic plants isn’t 
going to be clear to most folks.
 
✓ Filling readers in on any specific programs you’ve developed: Provide 
the programs’ highlights and be brutally honest as to their challenges 
and successes.
 
Not everyone wants to read the full text; some people just want the short ver-
sion. Make it easy for them to get just the info they really need, and you’ll be 
rewarded with buzz and new customers.

I
n response to the forest of chain stores peppering the landscape of any 
U.S. town in which people outnumber livestock, an exploding number 
of self-described independent businesses are popping up. Those that have 
weathered chain-store mania are banding together to create their own retail 
force to be reckoned with. From community groups to whole regional areas, 
hometown teams are committed to revitalizing their local economies. In fact, 
independent business alliances across the U.S. are predicting that buy-local 
movements will make as big of an impact as buy-organic movements have 
in recent years. Buying local may seem like a rather quaint idea, much like 
typewriters and poodle skirts. Au contraire! It’s more than a movement; it’s a 
revolution — an opportunity that’s loaded with potential and serves as a key 
component of a sustainable business model.
By infusing their local economies with a surge of enthusiasm and commit-
ting to using one another as resources, hometown businesses are bringing 
the focus back to Main Street. You can harness the same local enthusiasm 
by offering a wide variety of products and services that are produced and/
or distributed by independent entrepreneurs. After you have an idea of what 
relocalization means to you and your community, you can employ education 
and outreach efforts (such as community-based social marketing campaigns 
oriented toward changing behaviors) to help get consumers onboard. In this 
chapter, I show you how to make your business part of the buy-local move-
ment and how to encourage your stakeholders to jump onboard.

222
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
What Relocalization Means 
and Why It Matters
Relocalization is a big word to describe the return to a very old concept: 
looking to your local vendors and distributors for products and services. 
Depending on the size of your community, local may be defined as 50 per-
cent or more community ownership and a location within a 50-mile radius 
of the community. (Of course, this definition may not be very relevant in 
a sprawling urban area. In that situation, a more expansive definition may 
be desirable.) Buy-local movements are garnering ever-expanding interest 
as more and more consumers express concerns about foreign products 
(particularly foodstuffs and children’s toys) and the outflow of dollars and 
profits to out-of-area interests.
 
A localized economy has lots of different meanings and connotations, but 
generally it has the following characteristics:
 
✓ Local ownership: Businesses that participate are majority owned by 
local citizens.
 
✓ Direct control: The business owners have the right to choose their sup-
pliers and vendors, marketing campaigns, store design, and product lines. 
This freedom of choice is important because one of the basic premises of 
relocalization is that businesses purchase as much as possible from local 
vendors. After all, buying local accounting services and local media time 
stimulates local economic development. Also, the business owners have 
the freedom to offer products that your specific community’s consumers 
demand, as opposed to some nationally mandated product mix.
 
✓ Regional sourcing: As much product as possible is sourced regionally, 
recognizing that some items aren’t available in the region or even coun-
try and so they must come from foreign shores.
When it works well, relocalization can change the retail power structure of a 
community back to the mom-and-pop stores. Relocalization efforts encour-
age people to realize that the majority of North American businesses are 
human-scale and local — and that most jobs and innovation arise from these 
enterprises. That’s why the concept of relocalization is vital not only to small 
communities but also to the well-being of the U.S. economy at large.
All efforts that you’re making to green your business should fit into the 
triple-bottom-line model of considering the impact of your business on 
people, planet, and profit. (Flip to Chapter 1 for the full scoop on the triple 
bottom line.) Relocalization fits this model well because both the buyers 
and sellers who participate in it can contribute to the triple bottom line — 
socially, environmentally, and financially.

223
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
 
✓ People: From a social standpoint, sustaining a vibrant, local economy 
increases the quality of life of your employees, customers, and other 
key stakeholders. This improvement is the direct result of reduced 
sprawl and congestion, community building through the establishment 
of consumer relationships with vendors, and a sense of connectedness 
that occurs when shopping in smaller, more specialized environments.
 
✓ Planet: From an environmental standpoint, local products use fewer 
fossil fuels to transport and store products, thereby emitting less carbon 
dioxide, which causes global warming. Local products also often require 
less packaging and therefore don’t contribute as much refuse to land-
fills. Additionally, local businesses are generally located close to hubs of 
alternative transportation so that customers can shop without getting 
into single-passenger vehicles and contributing to traffic congestion and 
carbon dioxide emissions.
 
✓ Profit: From a financial standpoint, keeping commerce at the local level 
results in the multiplier effect, whereby dollars are recycled through the 
community instead of being removed from it. Consequently, profit 
comes back to your store again and again. Chalk one up for a truly local 
economy!
What’s all the buzz about big-box stores?
When big-box stores came on the scene in the 
late ’80s, no one predicted the U.S. would trans-
form from a nation of shop owners into a nation 
of clerks. Likewise, no one knew that formulas 
dictated from far-away corporate headquarters 
would determine what products you’d buy; how 
the outskirts of your town would look; or that 
the printing, accounting, and banking would all 
be done in distant lands. People generally didn’t 
think about these things because the allure of 
lots and lots of choices at uber-low prices in 
big, gleaming stores was, well, cool!
Unfortunately, many towns have seen the 
demise of their homegrown enterprises as a 
result of the big-box model. Studies show that 
about 1.4 jobs are lost in the local retail sector 
for every one job gained when the biggest of the 
big-box stores comes to town. Not only that, but 
some studies show downward pressure on all 
wages from the proliferation of big-box stores.
The controversy surrounding the seemingly 
endless glut of big-box stores and the impact 
on locally owned businesses is one that’s likely 
to continue into the future. On one hand, there 
appears to be widespread belief that big-box 
stores add jobs and tax revenue to a commu-
nity and significantly support local charitable 
organizations. On the other hand, studies have 
shown that net jobs actually decrease as the 
finite retail pie is reallocated to big-box stores, 
meaning local stores eventually go out of 
business.
There’s also the issue of big-box blight. Millions 
of empty square feet of chronically vacant chain 
store space are unsightly and costly. Between 
1990 and 2005, the amount of retail space per 
capita in the U.S. doubled, whereas income 
grew by just about 28 percent. At some point, 
market saturation occurs, which is apparently 
the stage the U.S. is in now.

224
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
A substantial part of relocalization efforts, buy-local campaigns are primar-
ily geared toward two actions: increasing customer awareness about all the 
upsides of choosing local products and then getting customers to modify 
their purchasing behavior accordingly. Certainly you can list many items in 
daily life that simply can’t be procured from your local environment. So your 
goal should be to get your customers asking “Can I buy this item locally?” as 
they go about their daily lives.
 
The relocalization trend has been incredibly effective for the buy-local food 
market. If your customers have heard any buy-local buzz, it’s most likely sur-
rounding local sustainable agriculture. See the later sidebar “Sustainable 
strides for agriculture” for more information on this topic.
How to Become a Buy-Local Business
Some businesses have a natural fit that encourages consumers to buy locally. 
For instance, if you own a ranching supply shop in Wyoming, you’re selling a 
product that meets a need for your community. Same goes for an optometry 
service in a Florida retirement community, a beachwear boutique in Orange 
County, California, or a rock ’n’ roll music store in Cleveland, Ohio. But then 
again, maybe the company you’re greening doesn’t have a clear-cut link. Does 
that mean buying local isn’t a part of your sustainability plan? Certainly not! 
It just means you can find your buy-local power by associating and cooper-
ating with other like-minded entrepreneurs. Becoming a buy-local business 
means joining with others to build awareness and opportunity for locally 
based consumer behavior, as well as purchasing your supplies and services 
from local businesses when possible.
 
The cornerstone of relocalization is getting involved with other business 
owners. After all, capitalizing on buy-local momentum isn’t a job you can do all 
by yourself. Think of your fellow business owners as a lovely little chain of 
islands that together make one great, sunny destination. You can join forces 
with your fellow local business owners in several ways:
 
✓ Become part of an independent business alliance. An independent busi-
ness alliance is a network of locally owned businesses committed to con-
sumer education in order to alter purchasing behavior to favor goods 
and services from the local community. From small towns to big cities, 
businesses are banding together to create vital city centers and healthy 
economies reliant on preserving community character. Currently, more 
than 30 independent business alliances are operating in the U.S.

225
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
 
✓ Join a local living economy network. A local living economy network 
is a vibrant, healthy community that relies on community-based capi-
tal, local businesses, environment-protecting incentives, and active 
community members — all of which are held legally accountable by a 
democratically elected government. These networks are working toward 
developing local human-scale economies that rely on independent busi-
nesses that respect all of their stakeholders. To date, the U.S. is home 
to more than 50 local living economy networks comprised of more than 
15,000 entrepreneurs.
 
✓ Participate in a co-operative, or co-op. A co-op is a buy-local model 
that involves the cooperation of several different kinds of groups and 
retailers; the term refers to similar businesses joining together to take 
advantage of the purchasing-power benefits that come from buying 
in volume. Co-ops can be formalized (such as a well-known hardware 
group whereby each locale has an individual owner but a shared brand 
and combined purchasing power) or informal (like a group of farmers 
coming together to sell local food).
In the following sections, I share the how-to info you need to start collabo-
rating with like-minded businesses, as well as suggestions for incorporating 
local resources into your business.
Joining or starting an independent 
business alliance
If becoming part of an independent business alliance sounds right for you, 
start investigating whether one already exists in your community. To find 
one, check out the organizations listed in the next section or try doing an 
Internet search using keywords such as “sustainable,” “green,” “network,” or 
“business,” plus the name of your local area.
Can’t track down a local alliance? Get on the stick and get one going! More 
formal alliances and associations help you relocalize your economy and 
develop greener business practices.
 
The first step in forming a local alliance is to pull together an initial steering 
committee to create a buy-local network for your community. Make sure to 
include representatives from all the different industry sectors and geographi-
cal parts of town. After you have a solid steering committee in place, you can 
delve into the nitty-gritty details I present in the following sections.

226
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Obtaining guidance from official organizations
As you work to get your independent business alliance off the ground, you 
may find it helpful to seek guidance from an official organization that can 
focus your efforts and offer some best practices. Although joining up with 
such a group costs money, doing so can save you time trying to figure out 
what works and what doesn’t. Trust me, that alone is well worth your fledg-
ling group’s hard-earned start-up capital.
 
Check out these organizations and consider becoming a card-carrying member:
 
✓ AMIBA: The American Independent Business Alliance is a nonprofit 
group that helps citizens launch and then operate independent business 
alliances. An AMIBA representative will come to your area and hold a 
workshop for interested parties to kick-start the burgeoning interest in 
your community. Membership includes templates, checklists, and all the 
how-to-get-it-off-the-ground info you can ingest. For more info, visit www.
amiba.net.
 
✓ BALLE: The Business Alliance for Local Living Economies is the world’s 
fastest-growing network of sustainable businesses. BALLE’s core group 
focuses on increasing the number of communities committed to going 
local, providing network opportunities, and catalyzing members new to 
the concepts of sustainable and just economies. To find out more about 
BALLE, visit www.livingeconomies.org.
Gathering info for a collective brainstorming session
To ensure your independent business alliance has a successful first brain-
storming session (described in the following section), you may want to assign 
some of these early research tasks to your steering committee members:
 
✓ Investigate whether your community has a buy-local food movement that 
can give you momentum and advice and share its membership data. The 
food industry is almost always where the first seeds of a buy-local move-
ment are sown, so it’s a great place to start seeking out resources and info.
 
✓ Examine what other like-sized and like-minded communities have done to 
relocalize their economies. (Note: Approaches tend to differ by the area of 
the country you’re in, so keep that in mind when seeking out examples.)
 
✓ See whether any regional opportunities exist in your area’s emerging 
green economy. These sorts of opportunities (think biomass conversion 
plants, photovoltaic silicon chip manufacturing, aquaculture, and so on) 
may be incorporated in regional or statewide economic development 
plans. Places to begin asking about sustainable development opportuni-
ties in your area may include
 
• Your local community development corporation
 
• Your local Chamber of Commerce

227
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
 
• Community financial institutions
 
• Downtown associations
 
Make sure to split up the task of going out into the community to talk to differ-
ent folks about your ideas among every steering committee member, because 
everyone has unique connections and insight. Also, provide each member 
with clear direction on documenting the conversations so that they can be 
easily brought back to the group. If you live in a metro area, make sure to hit 
all the different geographic areas where local indie businesses are clustered, 
not just the traditional downtown area.
Your research may point you in interesting directions, so stay open to making 
connections happen. For example, your emerging buy-local group may find 
that the proposed small-scale wind farm in your area could readily meet the 
needs of the new whole foods store. What about the local community college’s 
curriculum incorporating green-collar job training, including wind-turbine 
mechanics? The sky’s the limit when considering all the possibilities!
Creating a vision and brainstorming ideas for implementation
Because the goal of your independent business alliance is to promote place-
based consumer behavior, you must develop an outreach campaign aimed at 
broadening awareness within your community about who’s local and why local 
is good. Armed with the results of your research (see the preceding section for 
tips on acquiring info if you haven’t done so already), find a place to meet and 
keep your agenda focused on getting everyone’s initial ideas as to what “buy 
local” is and how there might be commercial strength in your numbers.
 
In the early days of getting together and talking about your alliance’s direction, 
you want to come up with a group definition of the benefits of local enterprise 
in your community. Also, make sure to do the following:
 
✓ Define what “local” means. The definition may seem self-evident, but 
it’s an important distinction. Many retailers are independently owned 
and locally operated, but they don’t carry locally made items. For 
example, your local bookstore probably doesn’t print and bind the 
books it sells; nonetheless, the bookstore can be considered local. Some 
franchises are locally owned but their vendors, accounting, advertis-
ing, and the like are all contracted by out-of-state franchise agreements. 
Additionally, some seemingly local businesses may be owned in large 
part by out-of-state parties.
 
 The definition of “local” gets much more complicated with food, where 
“local agriculture” can mean food grown anywhere from a 50- to 250-mile 
radius, depending on which expert you’re quoting.
 
✓ Determine whether you’re including a reference to sustainability in 
your buy-local group. If you are, everyone must be in agreement as to 
what sustainability means and how the alliance will assess whether a busi-
ness is committed to sustainable business practices. One way to assess 

228
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
a company’s sustainability is by providing a checklist or assessment 
instrument that the business can use to identify ways it’s practicing sus-
tainability. After all, paying dues and saying “I’m green” doesn’t qualify an 
organization as sustainable.
 
✓ Settle on what your membership fee structure is going to look like. 
Consider whether you want to price membership on a sliding-fee scale 
based on revenue or number of employees, or whether you want to have 
different fees for nonprofits versus entrepreneurial shops. Also, deter-
mine whether you want fees to be paid in kind or in cash.
 
✓ Figure out what your initial focus will be. Identify how your buy-local 
campaign will set you, as an aligned group, apart from the competition. 
For example, have everyone come up with some speaking points that 
define why consumers should buy from a group of local shops instead 
of going to the big-box stores or the mall. Examine what benefits your 
member organizations will realize and use that list as the jumping-off 
point to help you hone in on your alliance’s primary mission.
 
✓ Assign start-up tasks or form subcommittees. An organized indepen-
dent business alliance is an effective one. Right off the bat, determine 
who’s going to apply for nonprofit status; where your marketing plan 
and list of membership benefits will come from; who’s going to approach 
prospective members, bill them, and then collect from them; and who’s 
responsible for preparing a rough fundraising plan. These preliminary 
steps will save you time in the long run so you can spend more time 
engaging in member outreach and community education and less time 
making things up as you go.
Finding a level playing field on Uncle Sam’s turf
Locally owned independent businesses have 
found out the hard way that not only do their 
cities and states often fail to offer incentives 
for local enterprises but also that many govern-
ments actually create laws to relieve local busi-
ness’ big-box competitors of tax burdens. This 
loophole, which in some states allows chain 
stores to transfer their income to out-of-state 
subsidiaries (thereby reducing their taxable 
income and state income tax liability), creates 
an unfair competitive advantage for the chain 
stores.
Without getting thigh-high into tax theory, the 
good news is that a number of states are now 
closing this loophole and requiring that busi-
nesses follow a combined reporting method 
that doesn’t allow for this reduction in taxable 
profit. Vermont led the way in 2004, with four 
more states following in 2006. A number of 
states are now considering this major reform in 
corporate income tax law.
Local independent business alliances have 
helped bring these tax inequities to policymak-
ers’ attention of late and been part of effecting 
the tax changes. This action levels the playing 
field, from an income-tax standpoint at least, 
between locally owned businesses and chain 
stores.

229
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
 
Different kinds of people coming together with a common goal is great stuff. 
But it also brings diverse thoughts and approaches to the same table, and 
that means disagreements are bound to occur. For example, the owner of 
your local spa and pool company may not be completely on the same page as 
the manager of the downtown electrical engineering firm. Focus on what 
binds you together —the drive to revitalize your local economy — not what 
differentiates you.
Combining your product or service with 
others’ as a package deal: Co-ops
Co-ops are a type of entity that’s owned by more than one person and that 
relies on the group for decision-making. The co-op is a wonderful business 
model that uses all members’ skills to harness larger rewards than a single 
business would be able to achieve alone. It also shares the risks of business 
ownership unilaterally. You may choose to incorporate a consensual style of 
decision-making rather than the traditional “majority wins” democratic-style 
format. Joint marketing efforts, volume-discount buying, and the opportunity 
to take advantage of each member’s skills are the three key benefits of par-
ticipating in a co-op.
Most people associate co-ops with food. Credit unions are another commonly 
recognized form of co-op in that one person equates to one ownership share 
and thus one vote. The co-op concept is centered on the traditional buy-local 
motive: keep local capital in the community in which it operates. (Financial 
co-ops are a big part of European and Australian financial systems, and 
they’re springing up everywhere, including the U.S.)
Forming a local living economy network
Because local living economy networks often 
start with a hearty independent business alli-
ance movement, forming such a network may 
be a “down the road” goal for your community. 
But if you live in a very progressive community 
(such as Boulder, Colorado or Austin, Texas) 
that has nailed the buy-local movement through 
independent business alliances and is ready to 
move on to the next step, contact the Business 
Alliance for Local Living Economies about its 
advanced program. This program welcomes 
folks who are interested in strategizing about 
holistic concepts such as community-based 
finance and local economic development. Go 
to www.livingeconomies.org and click 
the Find a Network button to search for a net-
work in your regional area.

230
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
If you’re not a farmer or banker, don’t sweat it. Get creative and find a way 
to incorporate your business into a cooperative model. You’re local, so 
think about
 
✓ The connections between your business and the unique history and 
culture of the community in which you operate: For example, look for 
multigenerational businesses or ones that build on your area’s unique 
culture or resources. If several businesses in your community specialize 
in selling Eastern European products or serving Cubano food and drinks, 
take advantage of that heritage.
 
✓ Ways to pool your business’s and other local businesses’ limited mar-
keting resources and create a brand around them: Many businesses 
that join a co-op don’t have the financial capacity to buy media spots 
on a solo basis. Hence, one of the major benefits of co-ops is providing 
members with a chance to go more high-profile than they’d be able to 
alone. Make sure that the marketing efforts focus on what you have in 
common to help promote a homegrown food, locally spun wool clothing, 
or ethnically unique artesian household items branding opportunity.
 
As in all collaborative efforts, circumstances can always go awry. Watch out 
for these common co-op problems:
 
✓ Going into business with too many folks or people you don’t have strong 
background knowledge of can sometimes yield nasty surprises. Protect 
your business by doing your research on potential collaborators.
 
✓ Businesses in the co-op can have differing visions for the entity. 
Encourage a representative of each member business to come to the 
table as you craft your co-op’s mission statement together in a fluid 
and fun way.
 
✓ Marketing and purchasing power sometimes don’t seem worth the time 
and effort necessary to participate in the co-op. Be realistic about the 
true volume-discount purchasing potential.
Sustainable strides for agriculture
If you’re engaged in a business that’s impacted 
by food in any way, you’re probably aware that 
the buy-local food movement has truly arrived. 
Emphasis on regional food is making quite a 
comeback, particularly due to widespread 
consumer dissatisfaction with tainted meat and 
poisoned produce. As this local-food emphasis 
has grown, so has the number of farmers’ mar-
kets and other cooperative models. The number 
of farmers’ markets has almost doubled from 
1996 to 2008, an indication that people are very 
interested in having a personal relationship 
with the producers of their food.

231
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
Incorporating local goods and services 
into your business operations
As more companies become committed to sustainability in their own opera-
tions, they’ll strive to green their supply chains as a part of developing 
greener business-to-business practices. Finding sustainable sources for raw 
materials naturally requires businesses to look locally. If the raw material 
doesn’t exist in your region now, is there the potential to develop it? Often 
businesses coexist in the same town for years and are unaware of the possi-
bility for materials exchanges or that they can meet many of their purchasing 
needs without reaching beyond the local area.
 
You can always make use of the services and products your fellow community 
members offer. Food is a particularly easy means for local sourcing. For exam-
ple, if you run a day care, hotel, brewery, airport, nursing home, school, gym, 
hospital, restaurant, coffee shop, or bar, you may consider featuring about 10 or 
20 percent locally and sustainably produced food. As your relationships grow 
with your community’s sustainable food producers, you may think of new and 
innovative ways to partner with folks in your local agricultural scene to increase 
your reliance on locally grown food. Suddenly, everyone is in on the local-
food-buying game, creating stronger relationships throughout the community.
How else can your business relocalize its supply chain? First, I suggest you 
check out the Internet and see whether a search for your area’s name and 
the phrase “business material exchange” yields any results. What you find 
may be limited, because the buy-local movement is a relatively new concept 
in most areas of the U.S. (and it’s usually driven by a small number of people 
who craft concepts specific to their own towns). But don’t let that discourage 
you! You can also take a gander at the supplies and raw materials you use in

The more you can show your customers that you’re on the buy-local band-
wagon, the more they’ll evaluate you in a positive light and ask the same of 
your competitors.
Increasingly, city and even state governments are mandating buy-local pro-
curement policies, meaning that preference or points (if a bid system is in 
place) are given to regional or local vendors. This practice recognizes that 
even though a locally made product may cost a bit more, the long-term net 
financial impact for the government is more favorable.
Convincing Consumers to Buy Locally
Relocalization is all about putting the power of purchasing back into the 
hands of consumers who are willing to spend their dollars locally. Thanks to 
the dominance of big-box retailers in today’s markets, convincing consumers 
to turn away from chain retailers and service providers in favor of their local 
counterparts has become a two-part process. All the grassroots marketing 
ideas in the world won’t work unless you can impart a strong, unified mes-
sage to your customers by combining education with your marketing efforts 
for a powerful punch.
 
Educating consumers on their buying habits and showing them how buying 
locally can change those habits for the better is essential, so think carefully 
about what you want prospective buyers to know about the fundamentals of 
buying local. Because many consumers have no idea of the true costs of 
spending a significant portion of their budget on big-box store items, perhaps 
making that connection for them is the best place for you to start the educa-
tion process.
Doing so isn’t easy considering many folks’ purchasing decisions are moti-
vated primarily by cost. For example, an Iowan who visits a regional super-
market and finds peaches from Mexico priced 25 cents less per pound than 
the peaches grown 15 miles from his hometown is usually going to go with 
the cheaper option. Your job is to convince this shopper that even though he 
saved a quarter today, by buying fruit shipped in from another country, he’s 
going to pay for that savings both environmentally (through more fossil fuels 
consumed) and financially (through a reduced local tax base) in the long run.
 
Of course, including plenty of information about the benefits to the commu-
nity and environment is great, but discussing the direct benefits to the con-
sumer is just as important. In other words, force yourself to answer the 
question, “What’s in it for the customer?” Purchasing decisions are ultimately 
based on this notion of “what’s in it for me,” and rightfully so. Be prepared to 
answer triple-bottom-line questions, but also be ready to talk about the bene-
fits of buying local to everyone, including the end user.

233
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
The following sections prepare you to successfully engage your employees in 
the buy-local movement (after all, they’re the ones making the sales to your 
customers), use community-based social marketing to develop a targeted buy-
local campaign, and make behavior change as easy as possible for customers.
Getting your employees fired 
up for the community
One of the most important tools in your buy-local education and marketing 
campaign is the team of people working for you. Whether that’s just you and 
your spouse, or you plus 50 faithful employees, you have a valuable market-
ing arsenal on your hands — but only if you get your employees onboard, 
motivated, and even downright giddy about the buy-local agenda.
 
Here are some more quick and easy ways to build excitement within your team:
 
✓ Include “why buy local” information in employee training sessions.
 
✓ Each month, train employees on a featured local product so that they 
can discuss it thoroughly and excitedly with customers. (I always ask to 
see local or American-made products in a store and am astounded how 
very few clerks can point me in the right direction.)
 
✓ Spotlight stories about the successes of buy-local campaigns in com-
pany newsletters and on your corporate Web site.
 
✓ Sponsor an employee competition and reward whoever gets the most 
people to sign a pledge to buy local with a gift certificate for a massage 
or other service from a local provider.
 
✓ Give a couple hours per month of compensated time to employees who 
want to be more involved with your town’s local independent business 
alliance.
 
However you decide to pump up employees’ enthusiasm for buying local, just 
be sure to do it. Because you aren’t necessarily going to be the one behind the 
cash register for every sale, or the one providing every service, you absolutely 
need everyone in your organization to smile and say, “Thanks, Mrs. Jones, for 
buying locally today.” (If you’re into pieces of flair like the restaurant manager 
in Office Space, you can even make ’em wear a “Think local, buy local” pin.) 
Show that buying local is something you’re behind 110 percent and that you 
expect everyone to join you in evangelizing the concept. People tend to have a 
lot on their minds, so you need to keep the buy-local idea front and center in 
all that you do.

234
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Attracting consumers with a 
targeted buy-local campaign
Encouraging consumers to change their behaviors, including their purchas-
ing choices, is the primary goal of community-based social marketing, which 
focuses on using social norms and influences to get people to commit to 
a desired activity. As you probably know, changing someone’s ingrained 
behaviors is difficult. Frankly, sometimes even getting folks to question where 
they purchase their daily items can be a stretch.
 
Community-based social marketing is a response to historical evidence that 
mass media campaigns have often failed to provoke significant social and envi-
ronmental change. Asking people to alter their behaviors (and getting 
responses) requires a clever blend of subtly overcoming their objections to 
the behavior change while getting them to commit to the desirable activity. 
Folks also need to feel that the behavior is more socially acceptable in the tar-
geted community than the current behavior.
 
Instead of throwing your hands in the air in despair, take the following steps 
to help you develop a targeted campaign that entices community members to 
engage in buying locally:
 
1. Identify consumers’ barriers to buying local.
 
 You can’t get people to buy locally if you don’t understand why they 
aren’t buying local in the first place. According to informal studies, many 
consumers simply don’t know what buying local really means, which 
leads them to perhaps mistakenly perceive “local” big-box stores to be 
cheaper, have better selections, or be more convenient. But don’t just 
take my word for it. Ask a random sampling of residents around your 
community simple questions like
 
• What’s the number one reason you choose to shop at a particular 
store? (Ask this question first so you don’t lead the person into the 
buy-local answer!)
 
• Do you ever consider buying locally first?
 
• Would you consider buying locally first if I told you . . . ? (Rattle 
off a few compelling statistics here, like the ones in the following 
section.)
 
2. Develop a strategy that encourages customers to identify with “being 
local.”
 
 Information campaigns alone rarely bring about behavior change. Yes, 
education is an important component, but community-based social mar-
keting asks you to go beyond that and get your customers to identify with 
“being” something and to proactively commit to taking action. (A written 
commitment is more effective than a verbal one if you can get it.)

235
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
 
 The key is to get people to perceive that what you’re asking them to 
do — in this case, to buy local — is the norm. If Joe the Plumber sees 
other people asking about the availability of locally produced goods, 
he’s more likely to think, “Hey this is the norm; I should behave like 
that.” Work to combat consumers’ barriers to buying local by doing 
something like printing buy-local totes and asking high-profile com-
munity members to commit to carrying them on their shopping forays 
around town. The more consumers who are hesitant about buying 
local see others sending the message that it’s a socially acceptable 
thing to do, the more likely they’ll be to start buying local themselves. 
When it gets to the point that asking for plastic or paper bags at the 
store seems ridiculous, you know your community-based social 
marketing has triumphed!
 
3 Pilot your buy-local strategy within a small segment of your community.
 
 Hand out flyers about what buying local means at the local farmers’ 
market, or give out coupon books featuring independent businesses 
and ask people to commit to finding a local outlet for their needs. Get 
people to agree to try buying local and then follow up with them to find 
out what their experience was. Ascertain what you want to scale up and 
what doesn’t appear to be working.
 
4. Evaluate the impact of your buy-local program after it has been imple-
mented across a community.
 
 Try to determine how many people have heard of your campaign, how 
many randomly chosen community members now think about buying 
local because of your efforts, and how many of them are actually doing it. 
Share your impressive results with your key stakeholders and keep at it!
 
The more you focus your buy-local campaign on the benefits of buying local, as 
opposed to the downsides of shopping big-box stores, the more you dominate 
the conversation. Keep your campaign positive and focused on why buying 
local is such a good thing, as well as on what you are, not what you aren’t. 
Never ever engage in putting down the big-box stores. Instead, talk about what 
ties you to all of your different kinds of customers — the fact that you all call 
your local community home. Keep Main Street on the minds of your custom-
ers, and they won’t have time to think about shopping at the local price club.
After you have the outline of your buy-local marketing strategy ready to go, 
you need to start filling in the details. The next couple sections offer facts 
you can share with consumers as well as some media and public relations 
techniques you can implement as part of your campaign.
Arming consumers with some basic buy-local facts
Wondering how to pitch the relocalization message to consumers? Focus on 
the benefits to both your customers and the community at large. Let your 
customers know that

236
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
✓ Small businesses are the largest employer in North America. (That alone 
is a powerful statement.)
 
✓ Local businesses are owned by people vested in the community (like 
you!). These people are more likely to stay in the community and feel 
a part of its future. In fact, studies show that entrepreneurs and skilled 
workers have more of a tendency to settle in a community that’s tied to 
preserving its distinctive character.
 
✓ Hometown entrepreneurs contribute up to 2.5 times as much to local 
nonprofits as chain stores.
 
✓ About 45 percent of money spent at a local business stays in the com-
munity compared to only 14 percent of dollars spent at a big-box store. 
These dollars not only cycle through the community many times but 
they also produce tax revenues to fund schools and safe streets. (Local 
businesses do much more to enhance the local economy than big-box 
stores, contrary to all the media blitz you may have seen.)
 
✓ The unique shops and services available in your community are part of 
what brings tourists and their checkbooks to your locale.
 
✓ Local businesses quite often hire employees with better product knowl-
edge and more interest in getting to know the customers.
Spreading your marketing message here, there, and everywhere
Buy-local messaging isn’t a one-time endeavor. You want your customers to 
see these facts and figures repeatedly — on brochures, bookmarks, blogs, Web 
sites, posters, and so on. Take your buy-local message, complete with a quick-
and-dirty list of why buying local is advantageous, to anyone who’ll listen.
Reaping the benefits of big-box stores 
acknowledging relocalization strategies
As consumers begin to change their buying 
habits to accommodate growing interest in 
local products and services, you may notice 
your local big-box competition reaching out 
to local vendors and asking whether it can 
feature the vendors’ locally made goods in 
its stores. For example, an unnamed humon-
gous chain store regularly reserves some 
space for local products in each of its stores 
as part of its strategic operational plan. This 
acknowledgement of relocalization strategies 
creates more opportunities for local products 
to reach mass markets and hopefully spark 
consumer interest in further exploring local 
products. You may want to approach your big-
box competitors and ask for an opportunity to 
showcase your local wares in their locations. 
If they come to you, then you know you have a 
righteous movement on your hands.

237
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
In order to get your customers thinking (or rethinking) about where they buy 
basic necessity items, particularly building products, clothing, and food, tap 
into the wonders of free media. The buy-local movement is gaining promi-
nence in many communities, and local media folks are eager to join the fray 
not only for the value of local, feel-good news but also because they too have 
faced the realities of larger corporations taking over the local beat.
 
Consider tapping into these free media opportunities to spread the buy-
local word:
 
✓ Pen an Op-Ed to your local newspaper. If you’re a good writer, or if you 
know someone who knows someone who’s a good writer, sharpen up 
the #2 pencils and get yourself front and center in the daily rag. Make 
sure to sprinkle your articulate argument for an economy based on local 
business (that means no harsh judgments on big-box stores, regardless 
of how you may feel) with facts and figures as to how buying local ben-
efits everyone in the community.
 
✓ Create a short program featuring local vendors on a community access 
TV show. Community access TV allows programming initiated in and of 
interest to the local community to be broadcast to the public. To find 
your local community access TV station, check out www.community
media.se/cat/linksus.htm.
 
✓ Be a guest on a local talk show. Many communities have an early morn-
ing radio show that welcomes local guests for the purpose of discussing 
community events and the like. Identify a partner to join you. I bet if you 
call up your local farmers’ market coordinator and say, “Let’s partner 
on Ruth’s a.m. show at KGRN to talk about buying local,” that he or she 
would jump at the chance.
 
✓ Spotlight all of your events on TV and radio community calendars. 
Take advantage of community calendars to promote your holiday 
buy-local campaign or to tout your Independence Day celebration of 
American-made goods.
 
✓ Issue a Public Service Announcement. PSAs are forms of free advertis-
ing and usually are part of a bigger public awareness campaign about 
an issue that affects your community, such as the importance of buying 
local. They can be released on radio or TV (or both); now you can even 
find them on youtube.com. Although the media time for PSAs is free, 
producing them isn’t. However, PSAs can be powerful components of 
your buy-local messaging thread.
You can also launch a grassroots buy-local public relations campaign to tie 
in to your media relations efforts. Band together with other local businesses 
(like the members of your independent business alliance or co-op; see the 
earlier related sections in this chapter for more details on these groups) to 

238
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
take advantage of cross-marketing opportunities. Offer a flyer at every store 
that advertises everyone in the co-op or alliance and make handing it out and 
talking about it part of the checkout experience. Or you can design a logo for 
window clings and posters that are easy to spot in order to inform potential 
customers that your shop is independently and locally owned.
 
Don’t forget about the influence of your city council. Request that your city 
government purchase locally when it can, serve locally grown food at events, 
and get its green power from the local wind farm. Make yourself heard, have 
your buy-local fact sheet in hand, and go for it. (If you want to go even further 
and try to impact local policies, check out Chapter 5 for specific tips on target-
ing your efforts.)
Making consumer behavior 
change easy and enticing
In order to encourage consumers to change their shopping habits and sup-
port local businesses, you need to make doing so easy for them. Take the 
guesswork out of finding out about the local co-ops, farm stands, and home-
town retailers with ideas like the following:
 
✓ Offer a green-mart (lucky you if it can be open year-round) and adver-
tise it liberally. In green-marts, folks shop at local companies that model 
sustainable business practices. Instead of sitting in traffic to get to a 
big-box store to purchase products made in a far-away place, imagine a 
green multiuse building that’s easily accessible by alternative transpor-
tation. Green-marts house many local businesses, which provides cus-
tomers with one-stop shopping for organic food, natural body products, 
and sustainable building materials, as well as green pet products, books, 
and baked goods.
 
 Green-marts aren’t impossible visions; people all over the U.S. are pursu-
ing this idea. Join forces with them and dare to dream big. Make the 
green-mart just as obvious to consumers as the local grocery store.
 
✓ Provide car service to the local green-mart and/or sustainable retailers 
for customers who can’t drive themselves. Organize a green taxi service 
made up of hybrids or a ride-share program to your sustainable business 
outlet. Anything you can do to get people out into the independent busi-
ness alliance’s stores is valuable. It also helps you share community with 
your fellow citizens and feel pretty progressive while doing so.

239
 Chapter 11: Revitalizing Your Local Economy
 
✓ Put together a coupon book featuring all the organizations that have 
joined your buy-local network. Consumers who are new to your buy-
local campaign need guidance. What better way to provide that than to 
offer an easy-to-reference booklet of participating organizations. Often 
companies that join a buy-local alliance give small discounts to fellow 
member organizations or to consumers who are consciously trying to 
modify their purchasing behaviors by buying local.
After all that hard work, you may still get the response, “I love the idea of 
buying local, but it’s so time consuming/expensive/hard to find everything 
I need.” Bring in the big guns and find even more ways to make buying local 
really enticing. Make it downright sexy, patriotic, moral, or whatever else you 
think will appeal most to your customer base. You can
 
✓ Create special offers that directly benefit consumers. Offer a “buy one 
meal, get one free” night at the local diner that features local produce, 
brews, and meats. Work out a deal with your co-op buddies to offer a deal 
to consumers for shopping at their stores. The possibilities are endless.
 
✓ Make free samples part of the local shopping experience. Give out 
samples at the local green mart, artesian craft co-op, or farm stand.
 
✓ Consider creating a local gift card redeemable at every business that’s 
participating in the community’s local independent business alliance. 
Show your customers how this idea gives recipients a wide variety of 
options as to where to spend instead of limiting them to one chain store. 
Time your efforts to coincide with big consumer-spending rushes such 
as back-to-school or holiday shopping.
 
✓ Get well-respected local celebs (even if your best local celebrity is the 
high school football coach) to buy local and appear in some of your 
marketing efforts. Make the connection between the local celeb in the 
ad and the fact that more local purchasing lines the community’s coffers 
and enhances the parks and libraries that everyone enjoys.
 
✓ Feature second- and third-generation businesses (ideally with histori-
cal pictures) in materials that are linked to the buy-local campaign. 
This tactic highlights your unique community and the role commerce 
has played in its history.
 
✓ Get people to feel a sense of common purpose by asking them to sign 
a pledge to buy local. Such a pledge is typically a short statement of 
commitment to consider local vendors first.
 
✓ Provide actual results in your marketing campaign. For example, you 
can say that thanks to buy-local consumers, your town decreased its 
overall carbon footprint by 20 percent in the last year. Celebrate triple-
bottom-line successes any time you can!

240
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Buy-local movements are a proven success
Outreach campaigns aimed at educating con-
sumers about supporting independent, unique 
businesses are really working. The following 
anecdotal evidence provides a pretty telling 
story:
Prior to the local independent business alli-
ance’s Think Local First campaign, many 
Bellingham, Washington residents couldn’t even 
define what buying local meant. Even fewer 
residents bothered to consider local alterna-
tives first when making purchasing decisions. 
After four years of the campaign, 69 percent 
of Bellingham residents cited familiarity with 
the program, and three out of five households 
indicated that they’d changed their purchasing 
behavior because of the crusade. Not only are 
individual consumers in this community buying 
in to buying local but also 89 percent of par-
ticipating businesses say they now “always” or 
“often” consider whether a product or business 
is locally made, grown, or owned when decid-
ing on a purchase. Talk about a significant cul-
tural shift!
Here’s another great example: The Independent 
Business Forum conducted a nationwide survey 
of 1,382 independent retailers and reported 
that a desire to support locally owned busi-
nesses is emerging as a key aspect of consum-
ers’ shopping choices. Retailers in cities with 
active buy-local campaigns reported much 
larger increases in holiday sales on average 
than those in cities without such campaigns. 
Independent retailers (meaning non-big-box 
retailers) in cities with buy-local campaigns 
reported an average gain in sales of about 2 
percent over the prior holiday season, whereas 
those in cities without such campaigns saw an 
increase of less than 0.5 percent.

▶ Identifying strong partnership opportunities and picking the best partner
▶ Securing a mutually beneficial partnership and spreading the word about it
▶ Ensuring your partnership will stand the test of time
T
he old model of the rich, evil corporation and the benevolent nonprofit 
is a thing of the past. Identifying collaborative projects and partnerships 
with nonprofit organizations is a cornerstone of forming a sustainable busi-
ness. Doing so not only builds your corporation’s image of sustainability but 
it also contributes to society’s well-being. Both for-profits and nonprofits are 
seeing phenomenal success because partnering magnifies each side’s poten-
tial for positive social, environmental, and economic impact. The big pluses 
for you? You get free press, which in turn magnifies your work and garners 
attention, and you help build community around your sustainability efforts 
and those of your partner nonprofit.
 
Partnering with a nonprofit is a way of doing business that involves engaging 
with a chosen organization to accomplish both parties’ interests. Financial 
contributions may be a part of the picture, but they definitely aren’t the whole 
painting. Being a good partner organization means being proactive in leading 
your company to meet the societal expectations customers exceedingly have 
of who they buy from, not just throwing money at a cause. It also means being 
smart and ensuring that the issue you choose to tackle has an immediate and 
relevant tie-in to your product or service.

242
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
The Form and Function of a 
Successful Collaboration
In order to fully understand the value that a traditional business-nonprofit 
partnership brings, and to decide whether a partnership is right for your 
business, you need to know what such a partnership entails. Both parties’ 
responsibilities are crucial to fostering mutual benefits — if one party doesn’t 
fulfill its duties, the partnership doesn’t work.
The vital tasks for long-term success are finding and building upon a partner-
ship that will be synergistic and contribute to enhanced capacity for both 
parties. (Synergy is that great creative energy that’s unleashed when two 
parties bring mutually advantageous talents to the table; it drives them to be 
better than the sum of their parts.) Both partners should harness synergy to 
leverage each other’s resources and elevate each other’s respective capaci-
ties to a new level. A sustainability-oriented partnership is all about enhanc-
ing the triple bottom line.
For example, say you operate a regional energy company and decide to 
partner with a local agency that prepares at-risk teenagers to transition into 
adulthood. Your contribution is to teach the teens how to conduct energy 
audits. The triple-bottom-line results (as in the benefits to people, planet, and 
profit; see Chapter 1 for more details on the triple bottom line) are evident 
everywhere. Here’s how they break down:
 
✓ People: You’re providing a specific vocational skill for teenagers who 
might not otherwise gain it.
 
✓ Planet: You’re taking part in the reduction of future carbon emissions.
 
✓ Profit: You’re simultaneously training your next workforce generation 
and reaping the rewards of publicity surrounding your nonprofit col-
laboration
To see some real-life examples at work (and the benefits therein), check out 
these high-profile partnerships:
 
✓ Greenpeace and Coca-Cola are working to eliminate hydrofluoro-
carbons and chlorofluorocarbons from refrigerators. Benefits accrue 
to both parties: Greenpeace is attaining its environmental goals, and 
Coca-Cola is garnering invaluable free press. Note that both partners 
bring specific competencies and/or resources to the table. Greenpeace 
has environmental scientists and skills, whereas Coca-Cola has a cap-
tive audience and significant resources dedicated to furthering social 
and environmental initiatives.

243
 Chapter 12: Partnering with a Nonprofit
 
✓ The Rainforest Alliance and Chiquita are working to greatly improve 
labor conditions in Latin America. Value accrues to the nonprofit 
because its mission includes ecological preservation through transform-
ing land-use practices, and Chiquita has a happier and more productive 
workforce.
The following sections delve into greater detail about what each of you (the 
for-profit business and the nonprofit organization) bring to the partnership 
table.
How you help the nonprofit
Many nonprofits (which are sometimes referred to as nongovernmental orga-
nizations, or NGOs) are finding that access to additional revenue streams 
through partnerships with for-profit organizations is an integral part of a 
sustainable fundraising plan. After spending countless hours planning annual 
events that barely break even, or after receiving the dismal news that a sig-
nificant grant source is drying up, many nonprofit leaders turn to the idea of 
partnering with for-profit organizations. Here’s what they’re looking for:
 
✓ Products that may assist them in implementing the nonprofit’s mis-
sion: The nonprofit needs financial resources to acquire goods it can 
distribute to its constituents. For example, an agency committed to 
reducing deforestation in developing nations may turn to your outdoor 
gear company because it manufactures camping stoves. Together you 
can design and market a clean-burning, affordable cook stove that the 
agency can then donate to the population it serves. Or maybe the local 
branch of Habitat for Humanity comes to you because you own a hard-
ware shop; you can provide the nonprofit with thermal water heater 
wraps and compact fluorescent light bulbs.
 
✓ People (from the part-time, hourly employee to the CEO) and services 
to assist them in implementing the nonprofit’s mission: Nonprofits often 
need manpower to make things happen; your organization has employees 
who can lend a hand. Consider incorporating a matching plan for employ-
ees who volunteer (perhaps one hour paid for every hour volunteered, 
up to a monthly cap). Or think about sharing nonprofit information with 
key investors to persuade them to donate their time and/or money. If your 
staff’s already tapped out with volunteering, consider making your new 
nonprofit partnership a discussion item when you next meet with your 
key suppliers; they may want to be involved, too.
 
✓ Industry expertise: Nonprofits are often in search of people with indus-
try-specific or technical know-how that applies to particular tasks they 
want to accomplish. Here’s where you (or another representative of 

244
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
your business) can jump in. For example, a nonprofit board for an orga-
nization that develops affordable green housing by using low-income 
housing tax credits would gladly welcome the expertise of a mortgage 
banker or local developer.
 
✓ Expanded networking capacity: Nonprofits are always looking to 
build donor and volunteer databases, as well as spread their messages. 
Working with for-profit businesses helps them do both. Partnering is a 
particularly good way for nonprofits to gain access to new markets that 
they may not otherwise be able to penetrate, such as young professionals.
How the nonprofit helps you
At the same time you’re providing resources to help further the nonprofit’s 
mission, the nonprofit is also helping you. Your partner nonprofit’s image, 
capacity to connect with your like-minded customers, and community con-
nections will help your business
 
✓ Set ambitious and attainable goals to achieve a higher level of corporate 
social responsibility
 
✓ Find new ways of stimulating your own business capacity by tapping 
into creative thoughts about the nonprofit’s mission
 
✓ Demonstrate how to do good, mission-driven work by providing an easy 
way to tap into marketing capacity that you probably wouldn’t have 
tapped on your own
 
Additionally, partnering with a wisely selected, like-minded nonprofit organi-
zation can serve to strengthen your ties to the triple bottom line. Following 
are the main reasons that your company may find these nonprofit partner-
ships profitable on all three levels:
 
✓ Capacity for free publicity (of sorts): Sure the relationship may cost you 
money in terms of financial donations or lost profits from donated goods 
or services, but the extra, free publicity you’ll receive from being tied to 
an organization that’s tackling timely, relevant, and meaningful issues 
within the community is extremely beneficial. Because you’re partnering 
to solve the issue at hand, your leadership will be spotlighted and your 
reputation enhanced — for far less than you’d spend on advertising.
 
 Just consider what happens when a highly visible national environmen-
tal organization pairs with a consumer products conglomerate to get the 
word out about the latter’s new line of green cleaning products. By mass 

245
 Chapter 12: Partnering with a Nonprofit
e-mailing its large constituency, the nonprofit spreads the word of these 
new, environmentally sound cleaners in a way that would’ve cost the 
for-profit company tens of millions in advertising dollars.
 
✓ New markets for your sustainable products or services: Partnering 
with nonprofits creates additional opportunities for your company to 
network with other influential folks and identify new populations that 
may have an interest in your product or service due to your association 
with the nonprofit they support. Many times businesses find that their 
target market doesn’t necessarily intersect with the specific market a 
particular nonprofit serves, so by partnering with the nonprofit, they 
gain access to a whole new realm of potential clients or customers.
 
 When a local farm partners with an organization that provides com-
munity housing for seniors, for example, the farmer has a steady new 
stream of customers, meaning he or she can in turn put more money 
back into the local economy. At the same time, the seniors get to eat 
healthy, local food.
 
✓ Improved customer loyalty due to a sense of community and shared 
ethics: Community action is a powerful thing, and public sentiment in 
response to real and tangible change is a strong driver of consumer loy-
alty. This reciprocity between your business and the community-serving 
nonprofit revolves around a strong sense of mutual purpose, which cus-
tomers can sense. Survey results strongly indicate that consumers favor 
socially responsible companies and hold back from supporting compa-
nies with potential ethical issues.
 
 For example, as the owner of a fly shop, you can offer those who support 
your nonprofit partner (a bayou watershed education group) discounted 
rods with their nonprofit membership card, or a free fly when they 
commit to making a monthly electronic contribution to the nonprofit of 
$50 or more. Your new customers already feel a sense of camaraderie 
with your business due to a shared interest in healthy water, and you 
secure their loyalty further by offering them discounts that only like-
minded people will receive.
 
✓ Creative stimulation of ideas for new products or services: Frequently 
collaborations with nonprofits inspire ideas for new projects or prod-
ucts that will diversify your revenue stream. How so? Well, pretend 
you’re the entrepreneur for a small accessories boutique located next to 
the site of a proposed performing arts center. You approach your com-
munity cultural council to discuss collaborative efforts. The end result? 
An embroidered organic cotton tote that bears your logo next to the 
council’s — a perfect marketing piece that arts supporters will carry as 
they go about their daily shopping chores. Now that’s mobile advertis-
ing with a message!

Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Identifying Good Opportunities 
for Partnership
When searching for good nonprofit partnership opportunities, you want to 
look for thoughtful, relevant collaborations with established organizations 
that you believe in and that naturally complement your business. Don’t just 
jump on the bandwagon of every nonprofit that comes a’knocking, because 
you might not get what you need out of the relationship. (See the preceding 
section for details of what you should get from a good partnership with the 
right nonprofit.)
 
Finding the best nonprofit to partner with is going to take some research on 
the part of your company’s green team (for tips on building a green team, see 
Chapter 3). Your first priority is making sure your nonprofit affiliate meets 
your sustainability goals, so look for commonalities with potential nonprofit 
partners. You’re engaged in a for-profit endeavor, and your potential partner 
exists to provide services for a target population; however, the tie-in between 
your two organizations should be seamless.
With that said, don’t be afraid to be open to a wide range of organizations 
in your initial search for a nonprofit partner. Exploring the not-so-obvious 
opportunities can turn up some interesting bedfellows. These collaborations 
often broaden exposure, diversify and grow revenue streams, and develop 
new constituents for both parties — so long as your ideals are firmly rooted 
on the same page as your potential partner’s.
 
Partnerships can develop and flourish around a shared need, such as assets 
(vehicles or specialized equipment), office space, or expertise. Before you 
get caught up in what you want from this relationship, look at the proposed 
partnership from the nonprofit’s point of view. Doing so helps you antici-
pate possible conflicts or risk factors (like incongruent missions, differing 
scopes of influence, potential conflicts of interest, and any prior image 
problems either entity brings to the table) that may hinder the formation of 
a successful partnership.
Put simply, think about what you can contribute and who might need that 
(and vice versa) by asking these questions:
 
✓ What part of your mission are you currently not meeting as fully as 
you’d prefer?
 
✓ What areas of business do you want to focus on improving or expanding, 
and are there scale-up opportunities inherent in the potential partnership?
 
✓ What expertise or resources do you need but currently lack?
 
✓ What means of collaboration will best help achieve your objectives?

247
 Chapter 12: Partnering with a Nonprofit
 
✓ Who are your customers, and what are they likely interested in?
 
✓ What customer or client base do you most want to build up, and does 
your potential partner help you in that capacity?
 
✓ What will increase your public exposure in a way that has lots of posi-
tive potential and very little negative risk?
Following are a few examples of some potential partnerships to help get you 
thinking:
 
✓ If you own a local pharmacy, a natural partnership fit is to work with a 
low-income children’s healthcare organization because you both exist, in 
part or on the whole, to positively affect your community’s healthfulness.
 
✓ If you manufacture or sell PCs, you may want to partner with an organiza-
tion that’s dedicated to finding answers to the mounting e-waste problem.
 
✓ If you run a chain of assisted living facilities, your best nonprofit partner 
may be a group that’s working on Alzheimer’s research.
 
What to do if an initial green team brainstorming session doesn’t yield a stand-
out collaborative prospect? Try going to national.unitedway.org/myuw 
to find your local United Way organization. It won’t have an exhaustive list of 
nonprofits in your area, but its database is a solid starting point if you want to 
identify who’s who in your community’s nonprofit arena. Your local Chamber 
of Commerce or sustainable business council may also be able to give you an 
idea of nonprofits in your area by type of client served or mission focus. 
Additionally, many states and urban areas have nonprofit associations; find 
them by running a Web search with the name of your area or state and the 
keyword “nonprofit association” and see what pops up. Finally, if you’re 
located in a larger area, check out your local newspapers and journals 
because they often spotlight local nonprofits.
Assessing the Candidates and 
Narrowing Your Options
After you’ve identified some potential nonprofit partners, you need to make 
an intelligent partnering choice by doing some background research on the 
candidates so that you can better assess their qualities and narrow down 
your options. First, you need to conduct a prescreen to ensure that the 
potential collaboration is even worth pursuing. Then you must evaluate the 
potential nonprofit partner’s financial and operational health, as well as its 
image within the local community. Conducting this entire process, known as 
due diligence, is essential to choosing the right partner organization, and I 
walk you through each step in the following sections.

248
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Prescreening before moving ahead
Before you dive into in-depth research surrounding a potential partner-
ship and a corresponding series of meetings and discussions, you should 
conduct a prescreening review of your possible partner. Consider pulling a 
team together to sit down and go through the following list of questions. The 
ensuing discussion will help guide your decision to move ahead (or not!) with 
the more formalized assessment process that follows in the next sections on 
looking at your potential partner’s financial and operational solidity.
 
✓ How does their mission fit with your mission? Your company’s values 
must be congruent with those of your nonprofit affiliate. Additionally, 
the link between missions must be natural enough for people to make. 
Pet groomers supporting the Humane Society makes sense; pet groom-
ers supporting disabled vets may be difficult for customers to grasp, and 
therefore to remember the connection.
 
✓ How long has the organization been in the community? You abso-
lutely must be assured that the collaboration is with a strong, reputable, 
highly respected community group. Just because a potential partner is 
new doesn’t mean it doesn’t have these attributes; it just means there’s 
more risk involved because of the organization’s unproven record.
 
✓ What type of reputation do the nonprofit’s leaders have? Check out 
the board’s composition and investigate any other relationships the 
nonprofit may already have. Keep a keen eye out for any potentially 
controversial board members or executive directors. Nonprofit lead-
ers who’ve been involved in high-profile litigation or been accused of 
inappropriate financial or ethical actions can harm your business image 
if you partner with their organization. Conversely, if the nonprofit has 
well-respected and well-known community members sitting on its board, 
that’s a major boon to you should you choose to partner with the group.
 
✓ What, specifically, is potentially synergistic about your collaboration? 
Before moving forward with any partnership, you need to determine 
how it would be mutually beneficial. Do you envision engaging in public 
service projects together, giving money and/or time, or showcasing the 
nonprofit in your catalogues or storefronts?
 
A good prescreen usually results in up to five nonprofits that you feel comfort-
able moving through to the next stage.

249
 Chapter 12: Partnering with a Nonprofit
Sizing up financial and operational health
After creating your shortlist of candidates via prescreening (described in the 
preceding section), your next step is to determine whether a potential non-
profit partner is financially solvent and has a solid management team and a 
strong board. Review the organization’s health by determining
 
✓ Employee turnover percentage: High employee turnover costs a 
company money and time and may be the result of a poor (or nonex-
istent) human resource policy or inadequate management training. 
Low employee turnover almost always equates to satisfied, produc-
tive employees and strong retention efforts. Ask the nonprofit’s HR or 
accounting personnel for the organization’s employee-retention stats.
 
 Be sure to look at the length of time the nonprofit’s executive director 
(ED) has been in place, because employee turnover can be even more 
detrimental in that position. Lots of ED turnover may be indicative of 
tension between the ED and the board, or of a not-very-thorough execu-
tive hiring process. On the other hand, don’t assume that a long-time ED 
means all is well — sometimes that actually indicates stagnation within 
the organization. If the group has a long-time, widely respected ED, make 
sure to ask questions surrounding new visions and interests that the 
organization may be pursuing. And if you’re not sure how long the ED 
has been in place, just ask.
 
✓ Level of board involvement: The board of directors is typically the 
driving force behind a nonprofit organization; it’s also responsible for 
keeping the ED in check. High turnover of board members, low rates 
of meeting attendance, or lackadaisical financial and executive com-
mittees generally shows a disinterested or dysfunctional board and a 
nonprofit that’s neither highly effective nor closely managed. Promising 
signs include a vital subcommittee structure, good meeting attendance, 
annual retreats, and significant board giving.
 
 Gauge a potential partner’s board member involvement by reviewing 
board minutes for attendance and membership composition. For exam-
ple, is there a legal advisor? An accountant? A few professionals in the 
actual field of work? Identify the committee structure, looking specifi-
cally for a Finance Committee and an Executive Committee that meet 
regularly (as evidenced by subcommittee minutes). You may also want 
to conduct an interview with a past board president to gather the unoffi-
cial scoop on the level of board involvement.

250
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
✓ Solvency as evidenced by financial statements: A nonprofit’s financial 
statements can tell you a lot. Increasing liabilities and decreasing rev-
enue streams are red flags that you can easily spot on multiyear finan-
cial statements. Promising signs are manifested in desirable trends such 
as additional revenue sources, an increase in permanent endowment 
dollars, and stabilized expenses as a percentage of revenues. Ask your 
potential partner for three years of audited financial statements and 
search for these signs.
 
If this is your first go at a nonprofit partnership (and assuming you’re a 
newbie on the green path), I heartily recommend that you put together an 
outline of what you want to cover in your due-diligence process. Using the 
outline gives you and your green team the added benefit of easily comparing 
nonprofits and making an objective decision as to which organization is the 
best partnership fit for you. Be sure to include the items in the preceding list, 
as well as any other factors that are important to you. Also, consider assign-
ing a score to each of the preceding items to help you rank the candidates.
 
One of the easiest ways to do your background research on potential partners 
is to check out the local newspaper — pull all the press you can find about 
your various nonprofit candidates. Additionally, take a peek at the following 
Web sites; they’re strong resources that can help you evaluate the financial 
and operational health of existing nonprofits.
 
✓ www.guidestar.org: Visit this Web site to gather an overview of a 
nonprofit’s mission, verify a nonprofit’s legitimacy, and view a scanned 
copy of the organization’s recent 990 (a nonprofit tax return) to help 
understand the entity’s financial position. The site offers three levels of 
service. The premium and select versions will cost you, but frankly, you 
should be able to glean all the info you need from the basic level of ser-
vice, which is free.
 
✓ www.charitynavigator.org: This Web site shows evaluation results 
based on two criteria: how efficiently the nonprofit is using its financial 
resources today and to what extent it’s growing programs and services 
over time.
Getting a feel for the 
community’s response
A potential nonprofit partner’s reputation within your local community is 
extremely important to the success of your partnership. Your chosen non-
profit partner’s image should be harmonious with what you want to project.
Ask friends, family, and professional affiliates what they know about your 
individual nonprofit candidates and watch what sorts of responses you 
get when you mention prospective partners’ names to others. If you get a 

251
 Chapter 12: Partnering with a Nonprofit
vaguely disconcerting reaction from some folks, probe and ask why they 
have that opinion. If you observe a generally positive reaction, find out what 
people like or know about the organization. Also, take a look at your local 
newspaper and search the archives for stories (both positive and negative) 
to help you gauge the nonprofit’s reputation within the community.
 
If no one has even heard of a particular nonprofit candidate, you may want to 
question how much capacity- and image-building that organization will be able 
to bring to the table.
 
Gauging community image is more an art than a science and is consequently 
very hard to qualify. However, by merging the hard research described in the 
preceding section with this more intangible information, you should see a pat-
tern that will help shape your overall decision.
Choosing which candidates 
to proceed with
After sizing up your top candidates’ financial and operational health, as well 
as the community’s response to them, you should narrow your list of poten-
tial candidates down to no more than three organizations. Then, you need to 
compare them to each other to determine which partnership can bring the 
most benefit to you both.
 
Because one of the reasons for pursuing a partnership is to increase triple-
bottom-line results, think about prioritizing which of the three areas — 
people, planet, or profit — is most critical to you. Each potential partner 
offers different opportunities for your company, so you need to have a clear 
idea of how those opportunities match up with your unique goals. For exam-
ple, if you’re working hard to build a reputation for social justice, Amnesty 
International’s local chapter is arguably a better fit than a community land 
trust. In addition to weighing triple-bottom-line priorities, you should have a 
strong belief that your candidates have a true understanding of sustainable 
business development in general.
Meeting with the Nonprofit’s Leadership
The face-to-face meeting is the next step after you’ve narrowed down your 
potential nonprofit partners to just a few candidates. This stage happens in 
two parts: a casual meeting where your respective boards and/or top-level 
management have their first “how do you do” moment with each other, and 
a meeting (either casual or formal) where you assess whether your prospec-
tive partner meets the social and environmental criteria you’ve outlined.

252
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
✓ The meet and greet: The goal of your first meeting is multipurpose: 
to banter, to get to know each other, to exchange business cards, and 
above all — to get in touch with your basic gut feelings about the organiza-
tion. Make sure to share mission statements and specifics of your green-
ing plans. Figure out where enhancing key stakeholder relationships 
comes in to play. Finally, identify organizational capacity and discern 
whether an innate connection exists among the people who are going to 
be involved.
 
 Be sure to focus on the general vibes you get from this meeting. If you 
aren’t feeling all warm and fuzzy about the partnership prospects, pro-
ceeding to the next stage probably isn’t a good idea.
 
✓ The sustainability values meeting: This meeting is where you use the 
research you’ve already conducted (see the earlier section “Assessing 
the Candidates and Narrowing Your Options” if you haven’t done this 
research) to gauge in person whether solid collaborative potential exists. 
By conducting this social and environmental screen, you and the non-
profit representative are identifying each other’s organization’s sustain-
ability principles or values, accomplishments, collaborative ideas, and 
expectations in each area of the triple bottom line. Depending on your 
preference, these discussions can either focus on discrete processes or 
on mutual sustainability values and goals.
 
 You’re meeting with someone who’s potentially going to help you move 
forward with your sustainability efforts. This person needs to talk the 
talk and prove he or she can walk the walk — and demonstrate a capac-
ity to evaluate you through the same lens. Your contact should appear 
capable of growing your capacity as an ethically responsible organiza-
tion, not just capable of taking whatever you’re willing to offer.
What to bring with you
The sustainability values meeting requires a bit more preparation than is 
necessary when you’re merely meeting and greeting a nonprofit candidate’s 
leadership. Prior to this meeting, work up a set of talking points to express 
what value your company brings to the table. After all, you aren’t the only 
one evaluating the partnership potential. A judicious board of directors and 
executive director will be looking at you just as critically to see what you and 
your business can offer to benefit the nonprofit’s mission.
 
Be sure to bring hard evidence (press releases, media clippings, financial 
statements, business plan, and the like) along to back up any statements 
regarding your business’s community reputation, financial health, or overall 
vision. This combination of strong talking points and good documentation 
exhibits your professionalism and allows your potential partner to ask the 
right questions of you.

253
 Chapter 12: Partnering with a Nonprofit
If for some reason you didn’t share your mission statement or the specifics of 
your greening plans during your first meeting, bring hard copies of these doc-
uments along and have talking points prepared to highlight the key concepts. 
If you’ve engaged in any sustainability planning or specific ecoinitiatives, 
now’s the time to mention them.
What questions to consider
 
In order to make your final decision about which nonprofit to partner with, 
you need to pull together all the information you’ve gathered and ask yourself 
some key questions:
 
✓ Does the research you’ve conducted indicate financial and operational 
solidity?
 
✓ Do your management team and the nonprofit’s leadership click and 
seem enthusiastic about shared goals?
 
✓ Do you care about the same constituents?
 
✓ Can this relationship take advantage of a deep sharing of expertise and 
resources?
 
✓ Can you generate a broad action plan of objectives you want to achieve 
together?
 
✓ Will partnering with this organization further your sustainability endeav-
ors by enhancing capacity in that arena?
Solidifying the Partnership
Drafting effective partnering documentation can be an expensive, drawn-out 
process that involves attorneys and accountants. Some partnership-forma-
tion efforts, typically those involving small stakeholders, may find any sort of 
documentation too onerous. In that case, proceeding on a handshake is okay 
so long as both parties feel comfortable without written documentation.
But there is a middle ground — a straightforward way to indicate that you 
intend to pursue a common goal with your nonprofit (and vice versa) in the 
manner you both promised. This is called a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU). An MOU is a document that outlines partners’ respective responsibili-
ties — a type of old-fashioned gentlemen’s agreement, if you will. It implies 
intent and isn’t generally contractually binding.
 
Despite its fancy name, the MOU shouldn’t be chock-full of legalese. Overly 
lawyered documents quickly lose meaning.

254
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
The outline that follows describes topics an MOU should cover (or what you 
should sketch out verbally if you’re proceeding without written documentation):
 
✓ What your missions are: Briefly describe each organization’s mission 
and state why you’re entering into this mutually beneficial relationship. 
This language may be as simple as “We will enter this partnership to 
promote sustainable values in both our organizations as they pertain to 
enhancing animal welfare.”
 
✓ What both of you are trying to accomplish: Be frank and open about 
the reason for your collaboration. If you’re trying to expand your cus-
tomer contacts by partnering with a nonprofit that has a green donor 
base, then say so. Identifying where your missions overlap is critical.
 
✓ How you both plan to achieve your goals: Setting goals is great, but 
good luck achieving them if you don’t identify which partner is going to 
take the lead on which project. The language can be as simple as “I’ll be 
the lead sponsor on your annual cruelty-free products event” or “We’ll 
put our logos together on marketing materials to fundraise for your capi-
tal campaign for the new animal shelter.” You may also want to provide 
a clear line of responsibility for who pays the expenses by including 
verbiage such as “Each party to this MOU is responsible for covering its 
own expenses in relation to actions contained within this MOU.”
 
✓ Who’s going to be involved from both organizations: If specific people 
from both organizations need to be charged with carrying out specific 
action plans, indicate that on the MOU. Also, if a particular project 
requires a larger team, identify who will be on that team. Be sure to 
document contact information for both organizations’ representatives.
 
✓ How decisions will be made: Clarify the scope of responsibility of both 
side’s representatives. For example, do you have full authority to make 
decisions on behalf of your organization, or do certain project ideas 
have to be run up the company president’s flagpole? Be sure to specify 
how financial decisions will be made in particular. Set a dollar limit if 
necessary (by using language such as “No decisions that involve more 
than $1,000 can be made without additional line approval”) and then 
state who manages that limit. For instance, if larger-ticket endeavors 
require approval from the board president or ED (for the nonprofit) and 
the financial director (for your company), spell that out in the MOU.
 
✓ How often your boards will meet: Specify any planned retreats, debrief-
ings, and regularly scheduled joint board meetings. Also, plan to hold 
some type of formalized meeting at least semiannually.
 
✓ How to jointly assess your progress in the future: Identify upfront how 
you plan to determine whether the partnership is working. As in any 
new relationship, keep your goals flexible (especially if they’re quan-
titative, such as increasing revenue from new green products). If your 
company states that “We hope to enhance our image as an organization 

255
 Chapter 12: Partnering with a Nonprofit
concerned with animal rights,” identify how you’ll assess whether that’s 
being achieved through your nonprofit partnership. For example, will 
you conduct focus groups or customer surveys? Either way, this assess-
ment can be done at regular joint board meetings or at a separate time.
Sharing Your News
In order to give your new nonprofit partnership credibility and integrity, you 
need to make your company’s entire value chain (including vendors, inves-
tors, and customers) aware of your initiative. You aren’t trying to be like an 
anonymous donor; you, very publicly, want to celebrate your contribution to 
solving an identified societal problem with your partner.
Pepper the daily newspaper, local independent papers, community TV and 
radio spots, and nonprofit roundup forums with news about your collabora-
tion. Use free media as much as possible and ask your nonprofit partner who 
it has ties to as well. You may be astounded at how local media strives to 
focus on the positive goings-on in the community — and how being part of 
that focus boosts both your image and your desire to do more to increase the 
exponential power of community involvement.
 
In order to avoid the perception of greenwashing (stating that your business 
is green without taking the actions necessary to back up that statement), and 
to leverage your partnership to the hilt, make the congruency between your 
two organizations’ missions obvious to stakeholders. Saying “We’re vested in 
the capital campaign for the new animal shelter because we’re moving into 
a line of cruelty-free products” is a much more persuasive pitch than “We 
want to go green because of the compelling problems associated with climate 
change.” You always sound more credible when there’s an evident reason for 
your company to be involved in the issues and the work that the nonprofit 
engages in.
All the community goodwill that you generate must be sustained in order to 
have lasting effects on your customers, vendors, employees, and community 
members. Your partnering efforts are intended to not only influence these 
people but also to have a synergistic effect on your individual organizations’ 
further work and community reputations. Tuning up furnaces for low-income 
day cares may not sound media worthy, but most community newspapers 
have a weekly nonprofit roundup that such a collaboration could be a great 
fit for. When your customers see your name in the paper, your logo in the 
day care’s newsletter, and members of your management team working an 
early childhood education event (in a T-shirt that clearly indicates they rep-
resent your company, no less), the pieces of the puzzle start to fall together, 
forming a lasting impression.

256
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Nurturing the Partnership 
and Monitoring Success
Your business and your nonprofit partner may come together in a honey-
moon period where you’re working diligently toward the same goals — only 
to find out that you diverge down the road on approach or implementation. 
As in any new venture, be aware that certain factors can threaten your part-
nership’s success. Like all relationships, you need to assess your nonprofit 
partnership, either formally or informally, to determine whether the mutual 
benefits are accruing as anticipated. You also need to know how to recognize 
potential sources of conflict so you can resolve them early on.
Assessing the relationship
 
Complex quantitative models exist that can guide you through measuring a 
partnership’s success, but each of them center on the answers to four key-
stone questions:
 
✓ Are we meeting the goals we established collaboratively as outlined 
and on a timely basis? Go back to the original targets and goals identi-
fied when the original agreement was drafted (see the earlier section 
“Solidifying the Partnership” for more on this process) and figure 
out specifically which have, and have not, been accomplished. Of the 
ones that haven’t been accomplished, try to assess why not by asking 
whether the time frame was realistic and whether adequate resources 
were allocated.
 
✓ Are the projects’ results authentic and of high quality? This assess-
ment is qualitative by nature and requires you to clarify what kind of 
effect you’re attempting to have, not how much of it. Probing questions 
that provoke conversation about how to identify exactly what it is both 
parties want to achieve are often required. For example, measuring the 
number of new hits on your Web site that’s linked to your partner’s site 
in no way indicates whether they originate from the demographic pool 
you’re targeting. Instead, try to measure where the hits are coming from 
(for example, .edu indicates a university affiliation, and .org shows 
that there’s a nonprofit connection).
 
✓ Is there effective leadership in the project? Because many business-
nonprofit partnering opportunities rely upon a key relationship formed by 
representatives from both organizations, their relationship is paramount. 
Look at this team’s project-leadership style. Is it multidimensional, 

257
 Chapter 12: Partnering with a Nonprofit
flexible, and responsive to suggestions by affected parties? Are team 
members accessible by formal and informal communication channels? 
Are they creative and innovative? Do they invite feedback on the project’s 
progress?
 
✓ Are both parties contributing their fair share of resources (human, 
natural, and financial) toward the end goals? Cost-benefit analysis is 
inherent in all partnerships. In your ongoing assessment, both parties 
should be able to single out what has been contributed on their respec-
tive ends. If you were to line out a scorecard, these lists should be 
roughly equivalent.
 
There’s a reason you’re in business for profit and your partner is pursuing 
social or environmental goals, but don’t let that natural difference sway you. 
Redefine your mutual interests and leverage your successes to keep focused 
on building a good relationship.
Recognizing and resolving conflicts
Because all partnerships (and the people managing them) are unique, 
each dispute, of course, has its own particular nuances. The most common 
sources of potential dissension are
 
✓ Feeling like you’re giving more than you’re getting: Perhaps the non-
profit begins asking for more and more without necessarily providing 
extra benefit on behalf of your company. Avoid this conflict through 
strong communication centered on analyzing costs and benefits on both 
parties’ sides on a regular basis.
 
✓ Disagreeing with implementation methods: Although you outlined your 
common purposes and scope in your original partnership agreement, 
you may quickly find your implementation methods differing. To get 
your partnership back on track, be prepared to discuss what specifically 
you’re having trouble with and how you’d accomplish the mutual goals 
differently. Listen to your partner’s concerns and continue to come back 
to the reason that you partnered in the first place. Define what each of 
your roles and responsibilities are and outline any parameters that may 
help reel in the other party’s actions.
 
✓ Losing trust in your partner organization: If missed deadlines, half-
truths, or hidden agendas are creeping into the partnership, either you 
or the nonprofit may feel disrespected and become distrustful. A lack of 
trust erodes the foundation of a partnership quickly. Both parties must 
come together in open and honest dialogue to identify what the primary 
issues leading up to the lost trust entailed and how they can be allevi-
ated in the future.

258
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
✓ Experiencing unexpected negative outcomes: If you worked on a proj-
ect or event and, for whatever reason, experienced unexpected negative 
results, that can take away from the good work you’ve come together to 
do. Debrief immediately if a situation like this develops and identify why 
it happened, what perpetrated it, and how to avoid it in the future. Avoid 
pointing fingers and instead focus on how not to repeat the actions that 
resulted in the unwanted outcome.
 
If disputes and disagreements arise, employ the following tactics to resolve 
them:
 
✓ Revisit your congruent mission and reasons for forming the partnership. 
Nothing grounds you in your nonprofit partnership like remembering why 
you came together. Discuss your accomplishments and define why they 
were successful, being as specific as possible.
 
✓ Identify your short-term goals. You may find that you now have new 
long-term goals or that the operating environment has changed. This 
realization may require reanalyzing immediate action plans to get you 
both refocused on what you need to do right now to move ahead.
 
Collaborative efforts that further the nonprofit’s mission and enhance your 
company’s reputation must be sustained to accomplish both organizations’ 
economic, social, and environmental goals.

▶ Understanding the value of an ecofriendly workforce
▶ Crafting HR policies that connect sustainable job performance to wages
▶ Recruiting, training, and retaining exceptional green talent
▶ Aligning HR practices with overall corporate sustainability goals
H
uman capital (a company’s employees) and the systems surrounding it 
are the true cornerstones of building a sustainable business. Sure, you 
can argue that businesses are sustainable because of their operations and cul-
ture, but it’s the employees who craft and execute those ecopolicies and create 
that green corporate culture. Without developing personnel and implementing 
sustainable strategies, it’s rather difficult to go green successfully. That’s why 
human resource (HR) practices are a key component of sustainable business 
development.
Training and educating employees, eliciting and developing their ideas, and 
using corporate social responsibility initiatives as a way to recruit top-notch 
talent are all core workforce-related functions. Yet many companies are slow 
to embrace the notion that sustainability strategy is deeply tied to the hiring, 
training, and retention of staff. Transitioning your existing HR practices or 
developing new ones that parallel your sustainability goals is essential for 
ecosuccess. This chapter can help you accomplish either task by highlighting 
the compensation-, recruitment-, training-, and policy-related initiatives that 
can affect your overall green business efforts.

Recognizing the Importance of 
Developing an Ecosavvy Workforce
The time has never been riper to tap into the talent that’s searching for a 
green company to work for, and the signs are in the stats. For example, a 
Mortgage Lenders Network USA poll taken in 2007 shows that 72 percent of 
working women expressed a strong preference in working for green employ-
ers; 64 percent of men said the same. Other research shows that young 
professionals, in particular, want to make a difference in their chosen profes-
sions. A 2007 poll on green employment done by MonsterTRAK.com found 
that 92 percent of students and entry-level applicants preferred to work for a 
sustainable company and 80 percent of young professionals were interested 
in securing a job with a positive impact on the environment.
Consequently, using sustainability to build a positive employment brand in 
a tight recruiting market is a clever move. After all, the visionary and highly 
motivated entrepreneur-type prospects are naturally attracted to companies 
that pursue a socially and environmentally just agenda. (Flip to Chapter 3 to 
dive more fully into the mindset of a sustainability-oriented thinker.)
 
Having sustainably oriented employees offers several competitive advantages:
 
✓ More inspired problem solving: Employees who bring a sustainability 
lens to business decisions allow for a broader perspective that sparks 
innovative solutions to both common and newly emerging climate 
change–related business problems.
 
✓ Increased desirability as an employer: Intellectually knowing what 
sustainability is and practicing it in daily decision-making are two dif-
ferent animals. As you become known as a desirable green employer, 
you’ll have your pick of the green talent pool — individuals who already 
understand sustainability and have practice in maximizing people, 
planet, and profit through business strategy. Bringing them onboard 
gives you a powerful market edge. Just look at Patagonia, a company 
that receives thousands of applicants for each posted job opening. The 
synergy that builds from green-minded employees working together in a 
business can be unbelievable.
 
✓ Less stressed budget: Many employees who are committed to sustain-
able careers are amenable to flexible compensation and benefits, often 
preferring alternative transportation, flex work schedules, and other 
low-cost benefits over hard dollar cost-of-living increases. These options 
can give you more bend in your budget.
 
✓ Improved employee retention: Many green companies these days boast 
low turnover rates compared to their nonsustainable counterparts. 
That’s not just talk. In a green workplace survey conducted by the 

261
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 61 percent of respon-
dents who worked for an environmentally conscientious company said 
they were “likely” or “very likely” to stay at the business because of 
those practices.
Understanding What Green 
HR Practices Entail
If your business offers sustainability training, actively recruits green think-
ers for new openings, does a good job of aligning HR systems with the new 
sustainability agenda, and adequately communicates all of this, employees 
(both current and prospective) will warm to your company’s ecoideals. As 
your workforce becomes cohesive in its efforts, you can bank on benefits to 
your triple bottom line (people, planet, and profit; see Chapter 1 for the scoop 
on this).
 
Employee motivation is affected by a wide variety of factors, including HR poli-
cies, corporate culture, development opportunities, management style, and, of 
course, other employees. To pack the biggest punch when greening your HR 
practices, be sure to address the following areas:
 
✓ Training and motivation of current employees: In order to set your 
green initiatives in motion, you need the help of the folks who imple-
ment them on a daily basis — your current staff. Spotting the green bug 
in existing employees wherever you can is important. As you cull them 
and build on their interest, the enthusiasm will gather momentum, build 
capacity, and effect scaled-up change.
 
✓ Recruitment of like-minded folks: A couple years ago, recruiting green-
minded staffers would’ve hardly been worth a mention in print, because 
the list of institutions that turned out ecograduates may not have war-
ranted a mention in any book. Recently, however, the halls of academia, 
from which your business is surely recruiting, have responded to the 
greening of the general marketplace in a particularly progressive and 
visionary way. Universities and colleges across North America are by 
and large engaged in significant greening efforts in core areas: cur-
riculum; research and development; and development of operations, 
faculty, and staff. Other initiatives, such as carbon-reduction programs, 
sweatshop-free logo wear, and green dorms, have been led by student 
groups. Recruiting from these universities means bringing in young pro-
fessionals who’ve been inundated with sustainable living and are already 
focused on basics like reducing waste, conserving water and energy, and 
creating a more equitable world.

262
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
✓ Alignment of HR policies and practices with sustainability goals: 
Because recruiting and training sustainably minded employees are cru-
cial activities for the success of your green goals, your basic HR policies 
should reflect an ecofocus. Wages are a powerful motivating factor in 
the world of business, so what better way to improve the odds of your 
greening effort’s success than by connecting employees to green accom-
plishments through their paychecks? On the flip side, spouting your 
business’s energy-efficiency efforts in the breakroom while planning a 
company picnic filled with nonrecyclable materials from vendors half a 
world away won’t get you very far in the eyes of your staff.
Going Green with Current Employees
Filling newly created or freshly opened spots with employees who have a 
passion for green is great, but what about your existing staff?
When your employees come to work in the morning, they don’t leave their 
value systems at the door. They bring them to the offices, assembly lines, 
sales meetings, research labs, and retail outlets that compose your business. 
Because sustainability is such an all-encompassing framework, for personal 
as well as commercial life, one of HR’s jobs is to inundate personnel with 
ecothinking.
In this way, working for an organization that’s committed to going green sig-
nificantly impacts employees, who in turn find outside stimulus to bring back 
to the company, thereby contributing to a cycle of sustainability. The follow-
ing sections show you how to jump-start that cycle within your company; 
the process includes a complex mix of training, communication, reward, and 
recognition.
Introducing sustainability and 
encouraging participation
Your task is to find out what people are interested in and move upon that, 
starting small but thinking big. Note that keeping your company’s ecoagenda 
in front of staff day in and day out is a challenge. Instead of relying on depart-
ment heads or divisional managers to keep the green ball rolling (unless 
you’re lucky enough to have everyone onboard, of course), turn to the hiring 
folks to spearhead this endeavor.

263
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
Depending on their current knowledge of and interest in all things green, 
many existing employees may perceive widespread discussion of plans, 
policy shifts, and trendy training sessions focused on the latest green man-
agement technique as bothersome (at best) or a complete turnoff (at worst). 
How can you gauge where they’re at before you dive in full-bore? Ask for 
their opinions!
 
Marry employee inquiry and a training plan with a little firsthand research in 
the form of a very simple sustainability interest survey, like the one shown in 
Figure 13-1. Ask your hiring folks to administer it and use the results to deter-
mine where your existing employees are at regarding sustainability.
 
Figure 13-1: 
A survey 
for gauging 
employee 
interest in 
sustain-
ability 
efforts.
 
Sustainability Interest Survey
Very concerned:  I am interested in participating in a discussion group over
lunch twice per month aimed at envisioning how our company can increase
its sustainability actions.
Moderately concerned:  I am interested in receiving information and
research on how to integrate green thinking in my daily work life.
Mildly concerned:  I am interested in completing a sustainability survey to
provide information on what I am willing to take action on now.
Too much on my plate right now:  I know that sustainability is important but
am pressed for time.   The thing I am most concerned with regarding how our
company operates from an environmental and/or social standpoint
is_________________________________________.  If there’s one thing I’d
like to change it would be__________________________________________. 
Please e-mail me with follow-up information
at______________________________________.
By reviewing the results of this survey, you can gather an idea, albeit infor-
mally, about what sustainability-related concerns people in your organization 
have. This is a rudimentary way to ferret out which employees have aware-
ness and concern; it also gives you a chance to dial in on the most attention-
worthy issues in your employees’ eyes.
Beginning the discussions
 
The people handling HR procedures for your company can start informal edu-
cation and communication by asking to facilitate a discussion on green busi-
ness practices at various departmental meetings and functions. Their 
purpose? To make the case for sustainability as an emerging trend that each 
department should perhaps consider.

264
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
A great way to get the dialogue flowing in this setting is to start by providing 
employees with an essential informational article. I recommend using one of 
the following:
 
✓ “The NEXT Industrial Revolution” by William McDonough and Michael 
Braungart
 
✓ “A Road Map for Natural Capitalism” by Amory B. Lovins, L. Hunter 
Lovins, and Paul Hawken
 
✓ “A Deeper Look at the Four Systems Conditions” by Jill Rosenblum
Then, discuss how the article applies to your business. Be sure to bring in 
examples of best practices of companies already operating sustainably in 
your industry sector.
 
As you engage in discussions and follow up on the sustainability interest 
survey, always meet people where they are. Just because you’ve been eating, 
breathing, and living a green ethos doesn’t mean everyone else has. Lots of 
people are just starting to become aware that some big changes are afoot. 
Transitioning them from awareness to behavior modification will take time.
Harnessing the enthusiasm of ecointrapreneurs
An entrepreneur is someone who’s willing to 
take full financial risk to see a business pros-
pect explored, developed, and grown. He or 
she is willing to be accountable for all aspects 
of the operation and thus enjoy the success 
(or lack thereof) associated with the outcome. 
A successful entrepreneur has the ability to 
organize existing financial, human, and natural 
resources in a way that adds value to the mar-
ketplace where it didn’t exist previously.
Intrapreneur is a New Age term to describe 
entrepreneurs housed inside your company. 
Identifying them as socially or ecologically ori-
ented (hence the eco prefix) puts yet another 
spin on the term. The typical ecointrapreneur 
isn’t a zealot who forces his or her ideas down 
others’ throats but a passionate person who 
leads by example, sowing the seeds of cultural 
shift in day-to-day work life. Ecointrapraneurs 
don’t risk personal capital; instead, they expose 
themselves to risk by pursuing cutting-edge 
practices within your company.
Both ecointrapreneurs and ecoentrepreneurs 
have had the epiphany that business has the 
power to be the champion of change and is an 
integral part of a larger, sustainable society. But 
unlike their externally focused counteraprts, 
ecointrapreneurs aren’t vested with authority 
per se; they effect change through their passion 
for sustainability.
As a leader in your business, your job is to seek 
out these individuals and capitalize on their 
enthusiasm as you roll out your sustainability 
plan. Make sure to elicit the best these folks 
have to give by
 ✓ Offering them the opportunity to organize 
cross-departmental teams for projects that 
have a visionary component
 ✓ Encouraging risk-taking and rewarding 
out-of-the-box thinking
 ✓ Showcasing their work in high-profile 
organizational events

265
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
 
If the people who aren’t yet buying into the need to go green aren’t immedi-
ately integral to moving ahead with your sustainability agenda, it may be best 
to work by example and let projects speak for themselves. Many times ideals 
change when people see how well sustainability initiatives actually work. You 
can create credibility by offering realistic expectations of the impact of proj-
ects and training efforts. Don’t ever patronize or lecture though — that’s a 
surefire turnoff!
Making implementation easy and enjoyable
One of the most widely touted changes in HR policies nowadays is the growth 
of telecommuting, also known as e-work, an arrangement whereby workers 
perform tasks for their employers via a telecommunication link. It’s a highly 
popular phenomenon that will likely continue to increase in status as the 
costs of commuting to work in single-passenger vehicles (in both dollars 
and emissions) continues to rise. Telecommuting is especially good for jobs 
that involve computer design, online sales, and Web-based education and 
outreach. It’s also beneficial for markets that rely on the Internet for digital 
databases, such as financial products.
 
For all of its benefits, telecommuting has a couple caveats: a lessened sense of 
team camaraderie and perhaps some upfront costs to provide employees with 
the tools they need to work from home. The shift in the office dynamic can be 
easily handled — schedule physical get-togethers so that a sense of team 
cohesiveness still exists. You can also try limiting telecommuting to one or 
two days per week rather than all five. Implementing even a minor telecom-
muting option can lead to significant savings.
Unless your business is a candidate for becoming a virtual office (a business 
without a physical location), some employees must commute to and from 
work. As part of your office’s greening process, introducing ways to reduce 
fossil fuel emissions associated with this activity is a responsible and proac-
tive maneuver. Some different strategies that may encourage staff to change 
their commuting habits include
 
✓ Allowing flexible workweeks: Flexible workweeks, particularly four ten-
hour shifts, cut employee commuting expenses and carbon emissions by 20 
percent. Often they reduce the overhead burden for the business as well.
 
✓ Establishing a car-pool program: Use the company e-newsletter or 
breakroom to get folks chatting about driving together, even a few days 
a week. Reward this behavior with recognition or small financial incen-
tives (for ideas, see the following “Offering bonus incentives” section).
 
✓ Offering free or discounted alternative transportation passes: Look 
into the deals your local bus, passenger ferry, railway, or subway might 
be willing to offer your company.
 
✓ Providing bike racks, showers, and a free helmet program: This move 
encourages staff to cycle to work, which is healthy for them, the envi-
ronment, and your budget.

266
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
✓ Adding car sharing as an employee benefit: Approximately 600 cities in 
the U.S. support shared-vehicle programs. Such programs give employ-
ees who commute via alternative transportation a means to accomplish 
errands during the workday without relying on their individual vehicles. 
Some programs even provide access to a vehicle after hours or for week-
end outings.
 
✓ Setting up Transportation Savings Accounts: These accounts can be 
used to pay for employees to commute by mass transit or van pool. The 
limit that can be put away pretax (like an IRA) for transportation costs 
is $110 per month; this amount changes annually based on tax law. 
Employees get a tax-free transportation benefit, and employers receive a 
tax deduction for their contributions and associated payroll tax savings.
Following are a few other ways to encourage sustainable behavior that you 
may want to consider:
 
✓ Feature socially responsible mutual fund families for retirement 
investment options. Offer your employees the option of funding their 
401(k) or SIMPLE by investing in some of the oldest and most-proven 
green fund families out there: Winslow, Calvert, PAX, or Dominici.
 
✓ Offer unique community-oriented benefits. These benefits could 
include
 
• Promising employees a few paid hours per month to volunteer
 
• Matching employee charitable contributions, within reasonable 
limits
 
• Collectively choosing a social or environmental organization that’s 
value-congruent with your company and then matching group 
donations
 
✓ Promote sustainability competitions between departments with gift 
certificates to local businesses awarded to the winning group. Try 
contests like logging the number of commutes per month not made in a 
single-person vehicle. If you have multiple sites, challenge employees to 
see who can reduce energy or solid waste by the biggest percentage.
Offering bonus incentives
Regardless of how your employees are compensated, there’s always a way to 
incorporate sustainability into your compensation system by offering extra 
incentives. Innovation with rewards, cash and noncash pay, and benefits are 
musts, but designing these rewards, incentives, and recognition methods for 
employees who take on innovative sustainability efforts may require some 
out-of-the-box thinking. Consider HR-minded folks the creative leads when it 
comes to acknowledging employee performance, an ecowork ethic, and com-
munity participation.

267
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
Whether you add a component that ties attainment of specific sustainability 
initiatives as part of the review and reward system is highly dependent on 
your organization’s sustainability goals. But no matter how lowly or lofty 
those goals may be, your HR-minded employees can craft a benefit package 
that rewards staff for changing behaviors.
 
Following are just some of the ways you can spice up your benefit package:
 
✓ Set out a green suggestion box. As you implement a green sugges-
tion, return a portion of the savings that accrue from its results to the 
employee who provided the idea.
 
✓ Celebrate employment anniversaries with ecofriendly gifts. Rather 
than the useless bauble or yet another cake break, consider recognizing 
employee anniversaries with a gift certificate to the local natural food 
store or a free bus pass. New Belgium Brewing, for example, gives all 
employees a custom cruiser bike after one year of employment.
 
✓ Reward the use of alternative transportation in employees’ office 
commutes. It may be helpful to structure this reward around an accrued 
point system. For example, Clif Bar awards points to employees for 
each commute where they walk, bike, or use alternative transportation. 
Employees can then redeem the green points for on-site massages, 
company merchandise, gift cards to local shops, or public transporta-
tion passes.
 
✓ Restructure commissions. If your objective is to promote green product 
sales, construct the commission structure so that sales reps get the 
most commission money from pushing your green goods.
 
✓ Provide bonus pay. Be willing to give employees extra money if they 
meet certain sustainable goals. Outline specific parameters for each 
department and allocate bonuses based upon attaining scores in each 
area. Or you can consider taking part of the savings you accrue from 
sustainable initiatives and giving that money to the workers who made it 
possible.
 
✓ Offer financial incentives for employees who embrace energy-efficient 
cars. Consider offering rebates to employees when they purchase a 
hybrid car, like Bank of America does, or give employees cash to put 
toward cars that get aggressive gas mileage, like Google does.
 
✓ Create incentives for employees to change behaviors off the clock. 
Any motivation you can provide employees to take green behaviors 
home with them is great. Consider ways to encourage them to person-
ally recycle, downsize the family car, or increase home energy efficiency. 
Clif Bar, for example, gives employees up to $1,000 per year to help them 
add insulation, replace windows, or buy solar water heaters or Energy 
Star appliances for their homes.

268
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
 
Don’t forget to reward the staff members who are involved in developing 
benchmarks and indicators surrounding sustainability accomplishments. 
(This brainstorming occurs during the sustainability-planning process, which I 
describe in Chapter 4.)
 
After you’ve determined which ecobenefits pack the biggest punch, market 
them aggressively. You can use all the classic employee messaging modes, 
such as newsletters, blurbs on the corporate Web site or blog, and old-fash-
ioned posters in the breakroom.
Providing sustainability training
Training sessions, using both out-of-house and in-house resources, are a huge 
part of sustained outreach with employees about a company’s green initia-
tives and overall ecoethic. When it comes to outside training opportunities, 
you’d have been hard-pressed five years ago to find a conference or webinar 
to attend if you or one of your employees were interested in sustainable 
development. Now you have to pick and choose wisely because in this new 
age of numerous green training opportunities around the globe, your com-
pany’s financial resources are the constraint, not the availability of training.
Pretty soon your facilities manager may want to go to the U.S. Green Building 
Council’s national conference in a major metropolitan city with 25,000 of her 
closest friends. Your marketing assistant may ask permission to attend a two-
day workshop in Toronto to learn about sustainable branding with some of 
the biggest-name international leaders on green marketing. Or perhaps your 
controller is ready to formally use the Global Reporting Initiative’s sustain-
ability-reporting standards (which I delve into in Chapter 16) and wants to 
attend a seminar led by western European leaders who’ve been working with 
them for five years already. These are all great training opportunities, but 
most employers don’t have the cash on hand to fund every single one that 
comes up.
Sooner or later you’ll have to propose a sustainability training package budget, 
a fund pool that’s been set aside for training employees about green initia-
tives in business. Approach this budget like you would any other educational 
budget proposal (meaning you still need to run it up the senior-management 
flagpole if that’s standard procedure at your organization). Some companies
 
✓ Budget employee training as a percentage of gross payroll (and then a 
certain percentage of that number is used for sustainability training)
 
✓ Allocate different annual amounts based on job positions
 
✓ Ask for employees to request specific training and approve educational 
funds on a request-by-request basis

269
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
 
If your company can’t afford to send employees here, there, and everywhere 
for training, rest assured that there are plenty of ways to educate them about 
sustainability in-house. Here are just a few ideas:
 
✓ Bring in a consultant. If your whole staff is eager to learn what’s new in 
sustainability, you may want to consider bringing in an internal sustain-
able development expert. A recent Internet scan revealed an amazing 
772,000 hits for green business consultants, so you can have your pick 
of who to hire. Often in-house training, particularly of a cross-functional 
nature, can provoke innovative green synergy between departments.
 
 Because consultancy costs are totally dependent on location, scope, and 
your business’s needs, addressing a specific cost-benefit analysis is dif-
ficult, but here’s why brining a consultant onboard may be worthwhile:
 
• Consultants have often seen your specific challenges and opportu-
nities in other arenas and can bring that experience to your table.
 
• They offer an objective view of which initiatives will pack the 
biggest punch and which can be put into the “mid- to long-term” 
category.
 
• Their insight may lead them to suggest new ideas or ways to mas-
sage existing initiatives to meet your individual green goals.
 
• Their enthusiasm for green business can be infectious. A good 
facilitator not only shares her knowledge but also her passion.
 
✓ Organize a quarterly brown bag luncheon ecoseries. Bring in general-
interest speakers like a local contractor who works on green buildings, a 
recycling coordinator from your local university, and the town expert on 
alternative transportation, for example.
 
✓ Set up a book nook in the cafeteria that focuses on sustainability. Put 
out the Fair Trade Certified coffee or some relaxing teas and make it a 
welcoming place to read and browse. Make sure there’s tons of natural 
daylighting and select reading materials that can be ingested in pieces 
so an employee can get some value from spending time there, even if it’s 
only 20 minutes or so.
 
✓ Subscribe to a popular industry-based sustainability journal and 
ensure it makes the rounds among staff. Following are two journals to 
check out:
 
• Sustainable Industries Journal, www.sustainableindustries.com
 
• Green Business Quarterly, www.greenbusinessquarterly.com
 
✓ Designate a go-to person for sustainability questions. Employees need 
to know where to turn if they have green questions. If you don’t have 
a Sustainability Director or VP of Environmental Management, you can 
still easily centralize responsibility for answering daily sustainability 

270
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
questions. One person, most likely someone in the office, should have 
access to answers about what can be recycled, green office supplies, 
who coordinates the company car share program, and how to use two-
sided printing, for example.
 
 Don’t force anyone into this role. Instead, look for the opportunity to 
give an ecopassionate employee a shot at demonstrating his or her lead-
ership ability.
 
Retention of visionary and progressive employees is enhanced when a firm is 
committed to sustainability. To keep the corporate sustainability commitment 
in front of newly hired employees, make sure your orientation sessions con-
tain a significant green focus. Provide all new employees with a sustainability 
overview (possibly combined with education on the topic, depending on their 
familiarity with sustainability) and an idea of the tangible initiatives already in 
place. Be quick to point out references to green procedures and policies in 
your orientation package, which should include a mission and/or vision state-
ment, a sustainability policy (if you’re to that point yet), and an employee 
handbook. If you’ve established specific recycling policies, a green incentive 
package, or sustainability-oriented benefits, make sure to point those features 
out, too. And if you’re really moving down the green path with a company-
wide initiative like reducing greenhouse gases or creating products for the 
green marketplace, focus extensively on that in your orientation conversation.
Maintaining the green momentum 
with ongoing dialogue
Keeping an open dialogue with employees about your green business goals 
and initiatives is essential to avoid unnecessary conflict. Although few people 
are outright hostile to the general idea of sustainability, there are always 
those who are defiant of change in and of itself. The people handling HR for 
your business should reassure these individuals that company-wide sustain-
ability efforts aren’t about putting another to-do item on their lists. They 
should also ask questions as to why employees are skeptical and then actu-
ally listen to the answers. After all, in order to counter others’ arguments, 
you have to understand where their thought processes are coming from.
 
All the great green programs in the world are meaningless unless you estab-
lish formal communication modes to share your sustainability progress. After 
you begin incorporating green business practices, be sure to continue commu-
nicating the positive tone and continued emphasis of green in your company. 
According to SHRM, two-thirds of U.S. companies with a written corporate 

271
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
social responsibility policy regularly communicate with employees about their 
efforts. Strive to include a discussion of your company’s sustainability prog-
ress to date in traditional employee communication vehicles, like newsletters 
and blogs, as well as during events, training sessions, or meetings where top 
management is present. Based on what your goals are, powerful potential 
exists when the CEO announces that your company’s carbon footprint has 
been reduced by 7 percent this year, or that the recycled content of your 
product has gone from 12 to 30 percent in the last two years.
You’ve probably already established formal and informal lines of communica-
tion with your employees. Now, to the best of your ability, add a green twist:
 
✓ Write a “Going Green” column in the company newsletter outlining 
goals and objectives, progress to date, fun green facts gleaned from a 
newsy green blog or journal, and any stats that show your company is 
really getting its green on. If you’re tracking something like decreased 
kilowatt hours used per month or the number of employees using alter-
native transportation, that’s the kind of data that can foot the bill here.
 
✓ Post actual signage around your facility such as “Notice our paper 
towels are now brown; that’s because there’s no harmful chlorine in 
them” in the breakroom or “This new paper feels a bit different because 
it’s 80-percent recycled content” by the printer. Affix a green logo on all 
the signage to tie it together.
 
✓ Have a link right from your Web site’s home page that outlines what 
your company’s greening efforts are to date. Post the name of this 
month’s green transportation award winner and show a spreadsheet of 
the company’s energy usage (both before and after simple energy-saving 
ideas were implemented). These moves can help folks see that their 
parts in the greening efforts are paying off.
 
Education is also key to generating an ongoing dialogue about sustainability. 
When you come upon an interesting blog, e-zine, or article, pass it around, 
give people a couple days to look at it, and then ask them whether they’ve 
read it, all the while trying to generate further sustainability discussion. Of 
course, make sure nothing is too politicized or potentially offensive to folks 
who aren’t sold on sustainability. Keep the readings simple and informational 
in nature.
 
Burnout risk is high if you feel compelled to get every single person onboard 
with the sustainability mission. That’s simply unrealistic. Instead, continue to 
share research, model green behavior, and work with internal marketing staff 
to circulate informational and inspirational articles, columns, and other mate-
rials to employees on a regular basis.

Recruiting Ecosavvy Candidates
Increasingly, public tax dollars and private donations are infusing the United 
States’ more than 4,100 colleges and universities with sustainability in the 
form of green curriculums, research, and events. As a result, graduates with 
degrees in climate change, sustainable business, green chemistry, and renew-
able energy will have a clear and direct impact on public policy, technology, 
and the market in general.
If you want to win these ecosavvy grads’ attention for your company, now’s 
the time to start actively scouting green prospects and identifying what you 
want them to be able to bring to your organization.
 
Actively pursuing a sustainability agenda and marketing your company accord-
ingly offers you lots of opportunity to gain competitive advantage for the truly 
top-notch prospects. Just remember to be strategic not only with your image 
but also in identifying where these desirable candidates can be found.
 
If you’re interested in finding sustainability-oriented employees, practice cor-
porate social responsibility (CSR) in a transparent way. (CSR refers to pursu-
ing commercial success while emphasizing your company’s environmental 
and social contributions.) Make sure that your Web site and other research 
tools available for candidate access clearly outline your greening endeavors. 
Doing so gives your prospective employees a chance to develop questions 
and comments surrounding your business’s social and ecological commit-
ments. Clearly reflecting your sustainability agenda in your job descriptions 
and tailoring your interview questions to flesh out potential compatibility with 
your company’s green goals are also part of the HR function of hiring top-
notch green-minded employees.
 
Touting yourself as sustainable is great, but the candidates searching for green 
dream jobs can spot greenwashing (stating that your business is green without 
taking the actions necessary to back up that statement) a mile away. A spokes-
person for SHRM’s CSR and Sustainability Special Expertise panel credits pro-
spective employees with doing thorough sustainability background checks.
Greening your job descriptions
Fleshing out specifics in a job description to match desirable sustainability 
attributes with a prospect’s qualifications can be difficult. Often, embedding 
the necessary sustainability lingo in the job descriptions of senior manage-
ment as an obvious requirement for positions like Sustainability Director or 
Chief Environmental Officer is the easiest approach.

273
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
But what if you’re looking for a new product engineer or fiscal analyst and 
want the job description to reflect your green bend? Here’s the lowdown on 
common sections of a job description and how to make them mirror your 
business’s sustainability agenda:
 
✓ Job title and chain of command: This info helps prospects identify 
the nature of the position and who it reports to. It’s not a section that 
will be impacted by your ecoemphasis (unless of course you have a 
Sustainability Department with a director who’ll be overseeing green-
related jobs).
 
✓ Job purpose: This section addresses why the job exists within the com-
pany and what makes it unique; it must contain a reference to sustain-
ability. For example, if you want an engineer who designs with a green 
focus, you want to include the phrase “be leader of sustainable product 
design team.”
 
✓ Essential tasks or functions of the job: This area covers the primary 
duties associated with the position and needs to highlight specific 
ecoaspects of the job. For example, if you want a fiscal analyst who 
employs sustainability metrics, or a product engineer who cuts waste 
and considers secondary market potential for byproducts, state those 
desires clearly in this section. Each description should be tightly written 
to reflect the position’s specific green duties. For example, “monitor and 
conserve office energy” may be part of the Office Manager’s job descrip-
tion. The position’s compensation plan may then tie in a portion of com-
pensation to quarterly energy reductions.
 
✓ Job qualifications: Here’s where you specify the skills, abilities, educa-
tion, and experience necessary for the position. A green job qualifica-
tion section contains specific references to sustainability practices. You 
may want to cite familiarity with specific techniques, such as life cycle 
assessment for the fiscal analyst or biomimicry (design that emulates 
nature) for the engineer; I cover both of these approaches to product 
design in Chapter 7. However, because of the infancy of many of these 
fields, you may want to list them as preferred qualifications rather than 
required ones.
 
When you have the right sustainable job requirements and preferences 
crafted, you need to be able to explain them in your want ads. Refer to your 
company’s commitment to sustainable development in your advertising and 
ask that all résumés contain evidence that the prospects have contributed to 
triple-bottom-line enhancement in prior positions. Use a prescreening instru-
ment to determine which of the résumés received will get an interview and 
assign points to sustainable criteria, just like you would for any other skill set 
you’re seeking.

274
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Finding green prospects
If you want to secure visionary new recruits for your entry-level positions, go 
straight to the higher-education institutions that are pumping out students 
schooled in green theories and ideas. If you have a list of schools that you 
primarily recruit from already, search the schools’ Web sites using “green” 
or “sustainable” as keywords. You can also try contacting the institutions’ 
career-placement liaisons and asking about sustainability initiatives, curricu-
lum efforts, or specific majors that prepare their graduates for the new green 
marketplace.
 
Actual degrees and departments in sustainable development are fairly new 
(and still mostly centered in MBA programs). That’s why the best place to 
look for students who’ve had sustainability-specific classes is on www.aashe.
org, a Web site operated by the Association for the Advancement of 
Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), a group of American and Canadian 
colleges and universities working to create a sustainable future.
Each year the group publishes a report outlining the state of sustainability at 
member institutions; the most recent edition is available at www.aashe.org. 
Scroll down the page until you see the Top Resources column on the right-
hand side; then click the AASHE Digest 2007 link. After pulling up the file, 
turn to the index for news on the newest curriculum efforts at member insti-
tutions. You can also look for recruiting potential in specific areas, such as 
sustainable product design or renewable energy. The end of the curriculum 
chapter even features links to other reports that are helpful for recruiting 
specific employees, like individuals with green MBAs.
 
Many people conduct their job searches online these days, so if you want to 
catch the seasoned pros with a passion for sustainability, you need to post 
your positions where they’re looking.
 
✓ Green Dream Jobs: This Web site, which claims to be the only sustain-
able business job service, seems to be the most comprehensive listing 
for ecopositions at socially responsible firms. Visit www.sustainable
business.com/jobs to take a look.
 
✓ GoodWork Canada: This online job service, found at www.goodwork
canada.ca, posts jobs that run the gamut. The organization prefers 
that you pay to post your positions on its site, but if your company just 
can’t afford the extra expense (which isn’t that much for small organiza-
tions), the good folks at GoodWork Canada let you post your openings 
anyway.
 
✓ GreenBiz.com: This Web site, located at jobs.greenbiz.com, features 
easy-to-see industry sectors.

275
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
Interviewing candidates and 
assessing their responses
 
How exactly can you determine whether your prospective candidates have a 
clue about sustainability? Just ask ’em. Structure your interview questions to 
encourage the candidates to showcase their knowledge in this area. Consider 
including the following questions in the interview:
 
✓ What sort of direct sustainability education and experiences have 
you had?
 
✓ Who is your biggest ecobusiness influence and why?
 
✓ What do you feel are the two biggest opportunities within this position 
to contribute to the triple bottom line?
 
I also recommend asking a question that specifically targets triple-bottom-line 
thinking in the area a particular candidate is applying for, such as, “How 
would you envision increasing sales by 12 percent next year while decreasing 
our company’s carbon footprint by 5 percent?”
When it comes time to judge a candidate’s answers, you should gauge how 
comfortable the candidate seems to be with sustainability-centered ideas 
based on his or her responses — regardless of whether every question was 
fully answered. Focus on assessing prospects’ abilities to showcase that 
they’ve considered how their skill sets can contribute to a greener business 
environment.
Aligning HR Policies with 
Sustainability Goals
A business’s human resources professionals play a crucial role in leading 
that organization’s green movement. Being passionate isn’t enough (although 
that certainly helps). HR pros have to turn passion into concrete action and 
real deliverables and make sure that all the business systems are aligned 
with the company’s green culture. In addition to recruiting, training, evaluat-
ing, and compensating, topics covered earlier in this chapter, the following 
sections outline a couple additional matters for your hiring folks and human 
resources policymakers to consider.

276
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
Upholding fair wage standards
Setting and administering employee compensation often falls under HR 
policies, so whoever handles these tasks for your company should also be 
charged with ensuring employees receive a living wage. This is the calculated 
amount necessary to pay for housing, food, transportation, and healthcare 
in a specific locale. Living wage isn’t the same as minimum wage, but it does 
vary by area. You can run a rough estimate for your area using the Living 
Wage calculator found at www.livingwage.geog.psu.edu.
Additionally, a solid green HR policy may include a reference to wage differen-
tial, which is how many multiples your highest-paid worker makes over your 
lowest-paid worker. In the U.S., this multiple can often be in the hundreds of 
times, whereas in Japan, for example, the average wage differential between a 
CEO and the lowest paid worker is eight times.
If your company is committed to limiting wage differentials to a certain mul-
tiple (such as 10 or 20 times), make sure to sing your own praises from on 
high. This is a fairly unique policy that plays to a cornerstone of triple-bot-
tom-line theory: the integration of people, planet, and profit.
Tying compensation and benefits 
to green practices
A key HR duty is establishing wage ranges and rates for individual job posi-
tions, a process that’s referred to as compensation administration. As you 
strive to implement sustainable business practices, consider adding a vari-
able pay element to your compensation system by linking pay to ecoper-
formance. By including elements of sustainability in your compensation 
program, you can promote the behaviors you want to encourage in your 
employees.
Assuming you already have a good performance evaluation system in 
place, your next step is to make sure management and HR personnel agree 
on what percentage of the performance evaluation should be related to 
sustainability. This percentage should be large enough to be meaningful, 
but not overwhelming. A good starting point may be 10 percent. So, for 
example, if your employee-assessment system is based on points, about 10 
percent of the total points would be based on sustainability performance 
under this model. For jobs specifically created to further sustainability 
goals (think Recycling Coordinator or Green Chemist), you don’t need to 
have a specific green assessment allocation because all the position’s tasks 
are sustainability-oriented.

277
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
 
Because of the wide variety of jobs that can incorporate some component of 
sustainability, there’s no one formula for assessing green accomplishments. 
That’s why it’s important to have specific goals tied to specific incentives. 
How an employee achieves his or her sustainability goals is a matter of indi-
vidual innovation, resource constraints, and corporate culture.
 
Try tying senior management’s pay for performance compensation to meeting 
environmental and societal goals. Doing so sends a strong message that shifts 
priorities from short-term profits and daily share prices to long-term sustain-
ability planning (which ultimately benefits your triple bottom line). Xcel 
Energy, a renewable energy company that’s a member of the Dow Jones 
Sustainability North America Index, has 33 percent of its senior executives’ 
incentive compensation rely on meeting environmental goals. These goals 
fluctuate, but they’ve included meeting yearly targets for reducing carbon 
dioxide emissions and developing innovative technologies. The goals are 
clearly outlined in the company’s sustainability plan; each executive is then 
measured and compensated based on whether his or her department met 
those targets.
Greening the lingo on performance 
evaluations
Because performance evaluations are usually tied to accomplishing specific 
tasks outlined in job descriptions, be sure to update your job descriptions 
with references to specific green goals and tasks. See the earlier section, 
“Greening your job descriptions,” for more info.
 
Always tread lightly when adding green performance criteria to the evalua-
tions of current employees. A good way to handle reworking performance 
evaluations is to form a compensation team (which alleviates the perception 
that tying green achievements to compensation is a purely top-down man-
date). Members of this compensation team should include someone who han-
dles HR policies, a mid-level management representative, and various staff and 
line-level peers. You also need someone who understands the potential green 
aspects of different jobs. Ideally, you can harness internal expertise for this 
slot on the compensation team, but if no one jumps out at you, hire an exter-
nal consultant (see the earlier “Providing sustainability training” section for 
more on hiring this outside help; then check out Chapter 3 for tips on how to 
find a sustainability consultant).
 
Make sure any new ecotasks or activities that are assigned to an existing posi-
tion have a training budget attached to them. You can’t go in and require 
people to perform new activities that have been written into job descriptions 
if they haven’t been given the opportunity to learn how to do them. Phasing in 
new tasks over a particular time period may also be appropriate so employ-
ees’ job descriptions don’t appear to be altered overnight.

278
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
As always, communicate every step of the way. Members of the compensa-
tion team should be forthright and open about what their responsibilities are. 
They should also conduct in-depth interviews with employees to gather their 
opinions on existing job tasks and functions.
 
Ask employees to bring specific green ideas pertaining to their individual jobs 
to their performance evaluation meetings. Brainstorm together how these 
ideas can be incorporated into objectives for the upcoming year. Make it clear 
how much of next year’s performance evaluation will be dependent on attain-
ing these goals.
Setting an example with internal 
corporate events
As you consider ways to engage employees in sustainable thinking, set an 
example by making green front and center in your internal company events. 
When planning each internal corporate event, target reducing its associated 
waste output and energy usage, restricting its carbon footprint, and employ-
ing local food and fare as appropriate.
 
Include a short educational announcement that you’re making every effort to 
green this summer’s BBQ or quarterly seminar as part of the welcome to the 
event. Then cover what you’ve done in each of the target areas to work 
toward that goal. Be sure to have signs posted everywhere indicating what 
you’ve done to promote sustainability. Highlight the venue’s sustainability fea-
tures, such as new super-efficient lighting or the salvaged wood used to 
refloor the meeting area.
Limiting waste
Cutting down on the waste from internal corporate events is by far the most 
simple and visually effective way of showing employees how easy it is to 
decrease waste. Most events generate a tremendous amount of throwaway 
junk — styrofoam or plastic coffee cups, plates and utensils, plastic water 
bottles, office gunk, and other assorted landfill-bound items, most of which is 
completely unnecessary.
The educational impact comes from participants actively splitting their gar-
bage into three well-labeled bins and seeing how little actually goes into the 
bound-for-the-landfill receptacle. Set up three bins, two mid-sized and one 
small. Line them with the new-on-the-market, sugar-spun garbage bags that 
dissolve completely and clearly label each bin to reflect what contents it 
should receive.

279
 Chapter 13: Greening Your Workforce and Your Human Resource Policies
Here’s what to put in the various bins:
 
✓ Compost: Place your compostable paper plates, napkins, cups, and uten-
sils (called bioplastics), and all green garbage into one of the mid-sized 
cans. Green garbage is anything that’s vegetable- or grain-based. This 
compost winds up at your local farm, community composting effort, or 
university-based composting project. To find out who takes compost 
in your area (often local folks pick up compost from events), try calling 
your local government cooperative office or your regional university’s 
agricultural department. You can also check out the United States 
Composting Council’s Web site at www.compostingcouncil.org for 
information on members and education.
 
 To ensure everything in this bin is compostable, napkins and paper 
towels should be unbleached and made of 100-percent post-consumer 
waste. Check to see whether your bioplastic utensils (available online as 
well as in many local stores) are certified biodegradable by the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO). If they are, they’ll 
blend in with uneaten veggies and grains and be worm fodder in no time. 
Avoid placing meat products into your compost at all times.
 
✓ Recycling: Use the other mid-sized bin for recycling, preferably of alumi-
num cans. You may also need to provide glass or plastic recycling bins, 
but because you’re providing all the products for the event, you can 
choose beverages housed in aluminum or drinks that can be poured into 
rice- or corn-based compostable cups.
 
✓ Landfill-bound items: Those few things that can’t be composted or recy-
cled belong in the small bin. Generally, this category consists of meat 
byproducts and anything people have brought with them to the event.
 
Next to the three bins, I usually set out a small cardboard receptacle labeled 
“recycled office paper” for handouts people don’t want, or any other office 
paper waste. Because your handouts are all double-sided with 1/2-inch margins 
and available electronically anyway (see Chapter 6 if they aren’t), there 
shouldn’t be much content in here.
Decreasing an event’s carbon footprint
Powering an event (and the transportation of attendees and speakers to and 
from it) is the primary carbon footprint generated by your average business 
event. To quickly estimate how many tons of emissions your internal event 
will generate, use The Climate Trust’s Carbon Calculator for Events (found at 
www.climatetrust.org/content/calculators/Event_Calculator.
pdf). The Climate Trust is a nonprofit organization that focuses on advocat-
ing for sound carbon offset policy and investing in stable offset projects. 
Don’t worry about being pressured to purchase offsets by this organization.

280
Part III: Involving Stakeholders in Your Sustainability Efforts 
After you have this number in hand, you can buy green tags from a regional 
provider to cut your reliance on nonrenewable energy to power the event. 
Green tags, a renewable-energy instrument that indicates investment in or 
purchase of a certain number of kilowatts of renewable energy, allow you to 
invest in regional renewable energy. Although they don’t, in all areas, directly 
provide you with green power, they do provide capital for green power proj-
ects, thereby increasing the supply of renewable energy and contributing to 
downward price pressure for everyone. If this option doesn’t appeal to you, 
you can always purchase carbon offsets for transportation-oriented carbon.
 
Depending on where your event is being held, you may have little to no con-
trol over the energy source used. However, if you do have the ability to supply 
your own energy source (say, by renting a biomass generator for a street 
dance you’re sponsoring) or choose an energy-efficient venue (like booking a 
local meeting venue that gets its energy from solar panels for your annual 
stockholders’ meeting), by all means go for it and loudly proclaim your renew-
able energy sourcing to anyone who’ll listen.
Using local vendors for products and services
Set “100 percent local” as your goal for sourcing products and services nec-
essary to put on your internal corporate event. You may not hit that target, 
but having it keeps everyone focused on looking for local options. One place 
to start looking is with the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies 
(BALLE). Visit www.livingeconomies.org to find the location of the chap-
ter nearest you and turn to Chapter 11 for the full scoop on this organization.
You can also check to see whether local business alliances exist (particularly 
surrounding food). Be creative with your Internet searches and try plugging 
in the following terms in conjunction with your particular area:
 
✓ “Local food”
 
✓ “Green event planners”
 
✓ “Buy local”
 
✓ “Sustainable business alliance”

Part IV
Measuring and 
Reporting Results

In this part . . .
L
 ike many other ventures in this world, green busi-
ness is governed by standards. These standards are, 
however, still in the development stage and therefore 
need to be carefully applied. Adopting and applying stan-
dards can lend credibility to your greening efforts — so 
can applying for official certification as a sustainable com-
pany, as long as you’re working with credible organiza-
tions. This part takes you through the different entities 
that set sustainability standards and provide company-
wide green certifications.
On the other hand, all the great green progress in the 
world means little without a way to measure and commu-
nicate your results. If you spend time collecting data that 
tracks your progress toward achieving your various sus-
tainability goals, you’ll have an easier time pulling 
together an annual sustainability report to share with 
your employees, customers, and other stakeholders. 
That’s why this part also introduces you to the process of 
conducting a formal assessment and compiling your mea-
surements and commentary into an informative, easy-to-
read sustainability report.

Governing Bodies: Getting 
to Know the Standards 
and Certifications
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at standards and certifications that indicate sustainable development
▶ Figuring out how to pick standards to follow and certifications to apply for
▶ Holding your suppliers accountable to the same standards
S
tandards exist for pretty much everything in the commercial world: 
items you purchase, vendors you do business with, and transactions 
you conduct. It’s probably no surprise, then, that standards are evolving to 
govern how green business is defined and conducted.
Certification shows compliance with established standards and is necessary 
because often assessing whether a company’s green assertion is true is 
impossible. For example, it’s great to rely on third-party certifiers to stamp 
“Certified Organic” on meat or “Fair Trade” on coffee beans and chocolate 
without having to delve further into the company’s reputation.
This chapter introduces you to both green business standards and certifica-
tions, explains why and what you need to know about them, and tells you 
how you can use them as part of your sustainability plan, particularly when it 
comes to working with your suppliers.
The Basics on Standards 
and Certifications
When adopting standards and attaining certifications, what you’re really 
doing is creating a set of governing principles that guide all of your sustain-
able business efforts, from selecting suppliers to establishing employee 

284
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
policies. Basically, you’re laying out broad brush strokes to steer future 
ecoprojects across the board. Some companies refer to this set of guiding 
principles as a corporate social responsibility policy, a sustainability policy, or 
a corporate consciousness policy. Whatever the name, the theory’s the same.
The overarching purpose of incorporating such standards into your sustain-
ability plan is to achieve credibility in the eyes of your stakeholders. Doing 
so may not appear to mean a lot today, but it’ll become more important as 
time rolls on and green business standards evolve to become the norm. 
The next few sections give you the rundown on what exactly standards and 
certifications are and what they mean for your business, who creates and 
manages them, and why they’re beneficial to your sustainability plan.
What they are
Green business standards, sometimes known as sustainability standards, are 
essentially yardsticks developed by objective third parties against which you 
can measure your business’s sustainability. They primarily have two 
common goals:
 
✓ Making sure a company is constantly striving to improve its business 
performance and acting in a way that sustains (and even rejuvenates) 
the environment and treats stakeholders with respect and dignity. In 
short, they encourage a business to embrace the triple-bottom-line busi-
ness model, which considers people, planet, and profit. (You can find out 
more about the triple bottom line in Chapter 1.)
 
✓ Generating a common platform for understanding often overused terms 
such as corporate social responsibility, sustainability, and green business 
practices.
 
Standards are helpful for uniting efforts, maintaining focus, guiding managers, 
and crafting future expectations. When you’re developing a sustainability plan 
(see Chapter 4 for more info on doing so) or a corporate social responsibility 
policy for your business, pointing stakeholders to a backbone of standards 
gives stability to your efforts internally and lends credibility externally.
Standards can also help your organization recognize various business 
challenges and possibilities. For example, ISO14004 (see the later sidebar on 
“Familiarizing yourself with common standards”) identifies environmental 
risks and opportunities. It sets standards only for those elements that can 
be independently verified and strives to move a company forward with 
continuous improvement in environmental performance. If your company’s 
efforts to meet this standard are effectively planned and executed, your 
overall environmental impact will be reduced over time.

285
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
Additionally, standards are grounded in organizations that provide wonderful 
networking opportunities. Adopting standards and collaborating with 
other like-kind organizations is a key component of developing a sound 
sustainability plan.
 
Of course, green business standards don’t just involve setting forth a philoso-
phy to follow. They also affect the day-to-day business operations of your 
company, as well as its overall corporate culture of sustainability (meaning the 
values, dictums, attitudes, and beliefs you and your employees espouse). Your 
company’s image, as well as your operational policies and procedures, will be 
shaped by the standards that you choose to follow.
You may choose to adopt green business standards that
 
✓ Promote social responsibility regarding human and labor rights, organi-
zational ethics, and your company’s impact on biodiversity
 
✓ Enforce sustainability reporting standards (see Chapter 16 for more info 
on sustainability reporting)
 
✓ Regulate occupational health and safety management systems
 
✓ Encourage social accountability through the practice of collective 
bargaining, employee safety, and disciplinary practices
 
✓ Develop and provide guidance on administering an Environmental 
Management System
 
✓ Measure your company’s impact on the community in which you 
operate
 
✓ Show loyalty to suppliers who engage in Fair Trade practices and 
environmental innovation and offer quality products at an ethical price
 
Green business standards aren’t regulations. They’re just guidelines. The 
sustainability police won’t come knocking on your company’s door if you 
don’t comply with them. However, such standards do offer you a powerful 
vehicle to demonstrate your commitment to being green. They may also help 
you alleviate consumer concerns that you’re just another company engaged in 
greenwashing, stating that your business is green without taking the actions 
necessary to back up that statement.
Aside from adopting the standards set forth by a governing body such as the 
United Nations Global Compact or the International Labour Organization, you 
can also become certified by any one of a number of bodies that specializes 
in making you “official.” Certification indicates that your company has devel-
oped policies and procedures to manage the issues covered by the certifica-
tion, including solid methods of documenting how you’re ensuring 
compliance.

286
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
You should know that getting certified costs money. The number one consid-
eration as to whether to pursue certification generally revolves around 
resources. But because certification shows your stakeholders that you’re 
willing to walk the walk in your greening efforts, applying for certification 
shows you’re putting your money where your mouth is.
As for whether you should pursue certification for your business, the deci-
sion is really up to you. I can tell you that many businesses and government 
agencies are writing new facility protocols to require that all new buildings 
comply with LEED standards, but are foregoing applying for the actual certifi-
cation from the U.S. Green Building Council because of its cost. On the other 
hand, certification does allow you to display a stamp of approval that shows 
authentic third-party endorsement. Depending on your industry sector and 
customer base, this physical symbol of external approval may be important.
Where they come from
The standards that a green business may adopt didn’t just drop out of the 
sky like a diver without a parachute. They were created by (and continue to 
be managed by) all kinds of organizations and certifying entities. Some of 
these groups working to establish frameworks and standards for business 
sustainability focus on the environmental aspect; others concentrate on 
social issues; and still others offer corporate social responsibility (CSR) out-
lines. (CSR refers to conducting business in a way that considers impact on 
stakeholders and the environment while maintaining commercial success.)
The following standard-setting groups can benefit your organization by 
helping you make persuasive arguments for sustainability (based on their 
frameworks and standards) to your upper management or board and by 
giving your greening efforts authenticity in the public eye:
 
✓ Global Reporting Initiative (GRI): Covered at great length in Chapter 16, 
the GRI provides standards for sustainability reporting.
 
✓ International Labour Organization (ILO): The ILO seeks to promote 
human and labor rights throughout the world through 22 conventions in 
areas such as worker safety, maternity protection, and indigenous 
rights. Its standards are used for setting the people piece of your CSR 
policy.
 
✓ International Organization for Standardization (ISO): The ISO is an 
independent, nongovernmental federation of national standards bodies. 
It establishes principles that respond to identified international needs 
and have global applicability. Technical committees made up of 
experts from the industry sector requesting the standard lead the 
efforts. International and regional organizations may ask to participate. 

287
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
A proposed standard becomes an accepted ISO International Standard 
when two-thirds of the ISO national members that participated in its 
development reach a consensus. To date, the ISO has developed more 
than 17,000 International Standards, and more than 1,000 new standards 
are published every year.
 
✓ Social Venture Network (SVN): The SVN, created in 1987, has developed 
a written set of standards for conducting business in a responsible and 
ethical manner. The SVN Standards of Corporate Social Responsibility 
provide a comprehensive set of guidelines that can be used by a com-
pany looking to become more socially responsible. They offer principles, 
practices, and resources centered on nine topics: Ethics, Accountability, 
Governance, Financial Returns, Employment Practices, Business 
Relationships, Products and Services, Community Involvement, and 
Environmental Protection.
 
✓ United Nations Global Compact: First envisioned in 2000, the United 
Nations Global Compact is an affiliation of more than 3,300 companies, 
governments, and labor organizations that have adopted ten principles 
of CSR, making the compact the single largest voluntary CSR initiative in 
the world. If you have foreign partners or source materials outside of the 
U.S., this fact is particularly pertinent to your company. Businesses that 
follow the compact’s principles (listed in the nearby sidebar) consider 
their impact on stakeholders and the environment, which makes them 
credible foreign partners for your continued sustainability efforts.
 
 Just because a company participates in the United Nations Global 
Compact doesn’t mean that it’s certified as complying with the organiza-
tion’s principles. This fact is an important distinction, because a 
company that complies with principles isn’t the same as one that’s 
working toward compliance (that is, participating). On the other hand, 
a company’s participation lets you know that it’s engaged in policy 
dialogue surrounding CSR and that it belongs to a formal network.
As for where certifications come from, the entities that provide them (and by 
them I mean everything from overall green business certifications to certifica-
tions for sustainable products and facilities) are evolving rapidly. Why? 
Because as more companies tout themselves as green, the pressure to 
increase accountability for that statement is advancing. Some new certifying 
agencies are being born, and some older ones (such as Green America) are 
growing and developing in response to emerging green industry sectors.
 
States are starting to get into the certification mix too. California, for example, 
has published Green Business Standards that companies must meet if they 
want to receive official certification from the state as a truly green business.

Why they’re beneficial to your 
sustainability efforts
At some point, you may decide that bringing individual projects and diverse 
efforts together under one umbrella in the form of standardization is impor-
tant. Not only do you want to create some form of governing philosophy 
but you also want to be able to apply that philosophy to every aspect of 
your business operations. Why is that so beneficial you may ask? For a lot of 
reasons!
 
Adopting widely known and publicized standards and acquiring recognized 
certifications provide the following benefits to your company:
 
✓ Anyone from the outside looking in (from potential customers to the 
local news media) can see that sustainability is a priority for your com-
pany because you’re dedicating time and resources to setting up and 
adhering to standards by which to run your business.
Introducing the ten guiding principles of 
the United Nations Global Compact
With all the various green business standards 
out there, it helps to have a lay of the land 
regarding the overarching standards espoused 
by some of today’s standard-setting bigwigs. 
Following is a rundown of the United Nations 
Global Compact’s ten core principles, which 
participating companies adhere to:
 ✓ Support and protect internationally 
recognized human rights.
 ✓ Ensure participating companies aren’t 
complicit in human rights abuses.
 ✓ Uphold the right to freedom of association 
and collective bargaining.
 ✓ Eliminate forced labor.
 ✓ Eliminate child labor.
 ✓ Eliminate discrimination in employment and 
occupation.
 ✓ Support a precautionary approach to envi-
ronmental challenges.
 ✓ Initiate actions to promote environmental 
responsibility.
 ✓ Encourage the development and diffusion 
of environmentally friendly technologies.
 ✓ Develop anticorruption policies that target 
extortion and bribery.
With this breakdown, you can easily see which 
of these principles has applicability to your 
business or your suppliers and other value 
chain members. Use those principles to develop 
tangible actions. For expanded information on 
each of the ten principles, go to www.
unglobalcompact.org.

289
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
 
✓ You can better achieve triple-bottom-line results because more and 
more companies are only doing business with other certified companies. 
For example, many widely known chains are asking their suppliers to 
certify their products and/or companies in order to continue doing 
business with them.
 
✓ Your sustainability efforts receive added credibility because everyone in 
your organization can access the guidelines to determine where you’re 
going, sustainably speaking.
 
✓ You can better guide employees when they pose the question, “Is this 
product, process, or decision that I’m about to make congruent with our 
sustainability mission?”
 
✓ Standards often ask hard questions or demand arduous preparations, 
like conducting energy audits and generating long lists of best practices, 
which often focus your green commitments into ecoactions.
Choosing Standards for Your Business
You can adopt green business standards in one of two ways: Use the 
standards set forth by a larger, international organization to build your own 
personal standards philosophy, or work with an accredited body to get 
officially certified in regards to your practices.
 
Developing your own set of standards isn’t a task for the faint of heart. Do so 
only if you can’t adapt existing frameworks to address your unique needs. 
Make sure to thoroughly peruse the Social Venture Network’s standards 
before going it on your own. You can find them by visiting www.cauxround
table.org/resources.html. Click the Guide to CSR and Business Ethics 
Codes link; on the next page, click the Social Venture Network Standards of 
Corporate Social Responsibility link.
 
The agencies described in the earlier “Where they come from” section have 
thrown lots of resources at standards development and gathered tons of 
expertise in order to create and publish their standards. Rather than re-create 
social or environmental standards to include in your sustainability plan, have 
your green team spend time looking at the standards that are most pertinent 
to your team’s prioritized goals and determining which are the most relevant 
to your organization. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel — just borrow 
someone else’s tires!
As a small or mid-sized business, you may be surprised what you can pick up 
from the standards offered by organizations such as the United Nations 
Global Compact, the Social Venture Network, or the ISO. After all, many of the 
same principles apply whether your company employs 100 people or 100,000.

290
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
Say, for example, that you want to adopt an anticorruption standard as a 
policy in your company. Because of your sustainability commitment to 
corporate governance, you feel it’s important to have a set of persuasive talk-
ing points and rational arguments that will help your employees make good 
choices when dealing with decisions that cross into this area. Great! But how 
do you do that?
For starters, you can look up the United Nations Global Compact or Social 
Venture Network standard on this issue. Doing so gives you a brief value 
statement in the form of a principle that can broadly guide you in your next 
steps. In other words, it can help you practice what you preach so you can 
better develop a specific set of performance criteria to direct top manage-
ment as to hiring and firing practices, corporate privacy, and the allocation of 
company funds. As part of pursuing the standard, you also want to address 
how it affects your employees in relation to topics of bribery, embezzlement, 
or extortion. Ultimately, your anticorruption standard can provide a measure 
of success (see Chapter 15 for more on metrics) on your company’s path 
toward sustainability.
 
Even if you think things like corruption don’t happen in small companies, 
providing guidance for your organization is invaluable. Cover any such issue 
with a standard.
Your challenge at this point is to identify whether any of the standards set 
forth by the governing organizations presented in this chapter are good 
guidelines to use for your benchmarks (see Chapter 4 for details on using 
benchmarks effectively).
A bit of guidance for creating your 
own green business standards
If you’re intent on going it alone and crafting 
your own green business standards, start by 
using the cluster groups (sustainability priority 
areas) you and your green team designated 
during the sustainability-planning process (see 
Chapter 4 for more on this topic) as a staging 
point. From there, use the Social Venture 
Network’s strategy to identify the various 
dimensions of a standard.
 1. Draft a brief value statement to support 
your cluster group.
 2. Brainstorm as to what specific practices 
could be used to enhance your company’s 
sustainability efforts in that cluster group.
 3. Identify how you’re going to assess how 
well those efforts are going.

291
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
Many of the green business standards being cooked up these days may seem 
applicable only to large, multinational corporations. With the exception 
of B Lab and Green America (which I describe in the later “Considering 
Certifications” section), most of the standard-setting bigwigs and third-party 
certifiers covered in this chapter impact mid- to large-sized corporations. But 
just because you manage a smaller company with 5 employees as opposed to 
5,000 doesn’t mean you can’t run with the big dogs and adapt the same green 
business standards that they do.
Familiarizing yourself with common standards
Following are some examples of specific green 
business standards:
 ✓ SA8000 is a global and auditable standard 
for decent working conditions; it’s based on 
the ILO’s Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. More than 100 companies have 
adapted SA8000, which is administered by 
Social Accountability International. This 
standard provides specific criteria pertain-
ing to labor laws, health and safety, free-
dom of association, discrimination, 
disciplinary practices, working hours, com-
pensation, and management systems. The 
interesting fact about SA8000 is that it per-
tains not only to your company but also to 
all of your suppliers and subsuppliers.
 ✓ ISO14000 is a series of standards that speci-
fies what an Environmental Management 
System should look like. (All the ISO’s 
standards, by the way, are further broken 
down into specific standards under the over-
arching standard.) ISO14000 has many parts, 
as shown in the following table. In order to 
comply with ISO14000, a program must be 
structured to truly minimize the environmen-
tal impact of a company’s operations. If your 
company is interested in creating a program 
to accurately convey the environmental attri-
bute of your product, for example, you’d be 
interested in ISO 14020–14025.
 ✓ ISO26000 will be the first international 
standard to provide operable guidelines 
for social responsibility. The anticipated 
publication date of this standard is 2010. 
Because of the global visibility that the ISO 
has, the expectation is that lots of compa-
nies will move to this standard for assess-
ing how they’re doing with social policies 
and CSR reporting.

Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
Considering Certifications
As you become more familiar with the standard-setting organizations, you 
may start wondering whether becoming certified by one or another accredit-
ing body that can certify your entire business as green is best for you. Before 
moving forward with any such decision, you need to carefully consider the 
cost-benefit trade-off of pursuing certification.
For small to mid-sized businesses, certifying with either of the organizations 
described in the later “Reviewing two fairly new company-wide certifications” 
section is fairly low cost. What you get in return for that expense is a network 
of other companies to share information with and a way of showcasing your 
efforts to stakeholders.
 
Certification entities that are willing to certify your entire business as green 
without regard to your industry sector are popping out of the woodwork. 
(I found one that was willing to certify my business in just a few minutes!) This 
myriad of agencies may make it difficult for new green consumers, suppliers, 
and investors to know whether any certification you’ve received is from a 
valid agency. Such doubt can lessen the impact of your certification, negating 
any cost-benefits that came along with it. Answering a questionnaire about 
office recycling, carpooling, and computer sleep modes doesn’t provide 
enough info to certify a company as green. Pay close attention to the different 
programs that claim to have the capacity to certify your business as green, 
and you’ll find that very few are worth your time and effort.
 
To help you determine whether a particular certification-labeling scheme 
is authentic, visit www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels/eco-home.
cfm. This is a cool Web site that lets you plug in an ecolabel’s name to see 
whether it’s in the Consumer Reports database. If it is, you can pull up info and 
history on it.
 
Be mindful that reliable third-party certifications usually involve some sort of 
facility inspection and independent testing — consider these the auditing 
hoops you have to jump through. Authentic certifying bodies should also 
expect you to engage in follow-up assessments at regular intervals in order to 
keep your industry-specific certification intact.

293
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
Reviewing two fairly new company-wide 
certifications
The certifications you’re considering at this point aren’t product-related or 
industry-sector dependent. Instead, they apply holistically to your business’s 
entire social and environmental realm. Certainly products and services are a 
key part of your social and environmental impact (see Chapter 10 for a listing 
of certifications available for individual products), but the certifications I 
present in the following sections apply to your company as a whole.
Becoming a B Corporation
If your company wants to be recognized for the green thread woven through-
out it, and you want a way to showcase that you’re not engaging in green-
washing, the B Corporation certification may be for you.
The B Corporation certification is a third-party certification for businesses 
that are truly committed to fundamentally changing the way they do business 
by embracing a sustainable model. It’s managed by B Lab, a nonprofit organi-
zation formed in 2007 by three very successful entrepreneurs. B Lab works 
with companies that want to differentiate themselves from the pack because 
of an ingrained commitment to sustainability. Founding B Corporations 
include Seventh Generation, Method, Good Capital, and TBL Capital.
A company that’s interested in becoming a B Corporation should have a busi-
ness plan that reflects the desire to “create a public benefit” by virtue of its 
operations. Recertification is required every two years. To become a B 
Corporation, a company must
 
✓ Meet comprehensive social and environmental standards.
 
✓ Change its legal documents (such as articles of incorporation or partner-
ship agreements) to reflect the fact that the company is committed to 
maximizing benefits for stakeholders (rather than just shareholders). 
The term stakeholders includes community members, employees, 
customers, suppliers, and the environment.
Here’s how to apply for B Corporation certification:
1. Register at the Web site, which is www.bcorporation.net.
 
2. Fill out a 60-minute survey to assess your current level of environ-
mental and social performance.
 
 If you score 80 out of 200 points, you may go on to the documentation 
template.

294
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
3. Proceed through the documentation template in order to modify your 
legal documents to reflect your corporate commitment to greening.
 
 The founders of B Lab feel strongly that amending your corporate or 
partnership documents to reflect your business’s commitment to a wide 
array of stakeholders is necessary to reflect your sustainability pledge.
If your business’s request for certification is approved, you receive the 
following:
 
✓ The ability to exhibit the B Corporation logo, as shown in Figure 14-1, 
in your marketing materials, on your packaging, and in your corporate 
facility
 
✓ Access to a network of like-minded businesses to help grow your 
company in a sustainable manner
Figure 14-1:
The B 
Corporation 
logo.
 
 
B Lab’s rating system, which assesses whether you’re meeting comprehensive 
social and environmental goals, uses measurements and standards found in 
the Global Reporting Initiative, Wiser Business (a project of the Natural Capital 
Institute), and the Social Venture Network. So although the B Corporation 
certification is a newcomer on the sustainability-certification scene (and so far 
the only one geared toward small businesses), it has highly credible roots.
Getting the Green America Seal of Approval
The Green America Seal of Approval is available to screened and approved 
members of the Green Business Network, a membership organization that 
aids companies with demonstrated commitment to corporate social respon-
sibility. The Seal tells your stakeholders that your organization is leading its 
industry in social and environmental commitment and links consumers inter-
ested in stewardship with like-minded companies. Founded in 1982, Green 
America hosts green business conferences, makes ecomarketing reports 
available, and publishes the National Green Pages, a directory that links green 
producers and consumers (check it out at www.greenpages.org).

295
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
Before you can apply for the Seal, you must first join the Green Business 
Network. Go to www.greenamericatoday.org, hold your mouse over the 
Support Us link toward the top of the page, and click Join the Green Business 
Network. Fill in your information, pay a one-time screening fee of $95, and 
then budget in an annual membership fee (based on your annual revenues).
Seeking the Seal is your next step. Green America’s board of directors 
appoints and supervises the screening team, which examines your company 
in order to answer the following questions. (Note: The screening committee 
often seeks third-party data to verify information provided by an applying 
company.)
 
✓ How familiar is your company with the social and environmental impact 
of your operations, products, and facilities?
 
✓ What level of commitment have you shown to mitigating negative 
impacts?
 
✓ What tangible actions has your company taken in relationship to this 
commitment?
One of the numerous benefits to receiving the Seal is that your company is 
then qualified to be listed in the National Green Pages. Another key benefit is 
that you get to include the widely recognized seal (shown in Figure 14-2) on 
your Web site, storefront, and tradeshow displays.

Surveying your certification 
options by industry sector
Organizations are popping up all over the place for the purpose of certifying 
businesses that operate sustainably within specific industry sectors. On one 
hand, this situation is a good thing because greening a hotel requires meeting 
wholly different standards than operating a sustainable day care. But to your 
consumers who stay in hotels and take a child to day care, the myriad of 
certifying bodies may serve to confuse them. They may wonder why one 
umbrella organization can’t be in charge of verifying the sustainability of all 
industry sectors.

296

 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
Personalizing Standards 
for Your Business
 
When looking at various standards, use what’s applicable to your individual 
business situation and scrap the rest. Keep an open mind and an eye on how 
to downsize the macro stuff to make it applicable to your company. For 
example, international human rights treaties may have no relevance for your 
roofing company in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but standards regarding work-
place diversity or employee health and safety may have tons of significance 
and belong in your CSR policy or green mission statement. Although you may 
not be ready to implement a full-fledged Environmental Management System, 
info on the standard-setting bigwigs’ Web sites may lead you to consider 
actions you might not have otherwise.
If your organization is interested in personalizing standards espoused by 
some of the standard-setting organizations presented earlier in this chapter, 
first determine the goal or objective you’re trying to achieve per the stan-
dard, such as “Improve workplace diversity.” Doing so helps you think about 
the issues you need to craft a good standard.
 
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) offers a checklist of 
the four guiding principles inherent in setting a strong sustainability standard. 
Here’s how you can make use of it:
 
✓ Commitment and Policy: Think about who will be accountable for 
upholding the standard and where the resources for meeting it will 
come from. For example, “The board of directors will analyze perfor-
mance annually. The training budget necessary to develop workforce 
diversity will come from a 3.5 percent increase allocable to the HR 
department beginning next calendar year.”
 
✓ Planning: Outline concrete interim objectives and corresponding meth-
ods of identifying the plan’s impact. Something like “We seek to mirror 
the community from which we recruit in our management training pro-
gram” is a great start, but you also want to craft specific ways to attract 
minorities with outreach and engagement efforts.
 
✓ Implementation and Operation: Consider what procedures are in place 
to achieve your targets and what documentation is required. Outlining 
interim measurements to see how you’re doing is extremely important. 
Here’s a good example: “At the end of each quarter, we hope to increase 
minority enrollment in our training programs by 6 percent, as shown by 
enrollment numbers.”

298
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
✓ Checking and Corrective Action: Have a strong and systematic monitor-
ing system in place to ensure that your programs and procedures are 
working. “If we haven’t attained a 6-percent growth rate for minorities 
in our training program by the end of the first quarter, our outreach 
efforts will shift from using HR resources to marketing the program on 
the company intranet.”
Applying Standards to 
Your Supply Chain
A green company is both accountable to its stakeholders and willing and 
motivated to extend that responsibility up and down its supply chain. 
Greening the supply chain refers to working with your suppliers, vendors, and 
logistics partners (distribution and warehousing) to ensure they’re commit-
ted to sustainability practices. You absolutely must understand the environ-
mental policies and processes of your suppliers, the conditions under which 
their workers labor, and their commitment level to greening their suppliers 
as you draft your sustainability plan.
Although you may not directly employ workers on a global scale, it’s a fair 
bet that some of your suppliers do. If they operate in countries that have 
ratified the International Labour Organziation’s (ILO) standards, they’re 
bound by ’em. (For a quick look at which countries have ratified the ILO stan-
dards, go to www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/docs/declworld.htm.) The 
ILO’s standards are compiled under the umbrella of four broad conventions 
that cover
 
✓ Freedom of association and collective bargaining
 
✓ Elimination of forced and compulsory labor
 
✓ Elimination of discrimination
 
✓ Abolition of child labor
 
When you’re chatting with a supplier about its corporate greening efforts, 
inquire as to the following. Of course, if a supplier can provide you with green 
information about each of these topics, that demonstrates the company is 
willing to take action to match its ecoclaims — and that’s exactly the kind of 
green supply partnership you want!
 
✓ Its willingness to be innovative to help meet your unique needs for 
sustainable raw materials: For example, you may want a finish for the 
cabinets in your woodworking business that’s biobased and nontoxic. If 
your supplier is resistant to the idea of sourcing these kinds of products 
for you, it may be time to either look at some alternatives or present the 
business case for sustainability (which I share in Chapter 1) to get your 
current vendor onboard.

299
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
 
✓ How it processes its manufacturing waste: Minimizing waste streams 
throughout the supply chain is a primary goal of greening the supply 
chain. If your supplier’s scrap becomes raw material for another supply 
chain, you’re working with an efficient business that’s on its way to 
becoming green.
 
✓ What design processes and protocols it uses for proposing and craft-
ing new products: If it follows Cradle to Cradle protocol or assesses its 
product’s life cycle to determine how to reduce usage of energy, natural 
resources, and water, you’re dealing with a company that’s on the right 
track. (Flip to Chapter 7 for more on these approaches to product 
design.)
 
✓ The degree to which it engages in formal sustainability planning: 
Does your supplier have a green team (see Chapter 3 for more on this 
essential element of the sustainability-planning process)? How about 
assessment instruments to chart ecoprogress and resources allocated 
to sustainability training? If your supplier has any of these things, that 
shows a commitment to sustainable corporate development.
 
✓ The company’s knowledge of and/or affiliation with any of the 
standard-setting or networking organizations: Such organizations 
include the Global Reporting Initiative, Social Venture Network, Business 
for Social Responsibility, and the ILO. If a supplier has adopted an 
international organization’s standards, that indicates the company has 
a powerful commitment to expanding its sustainability networking and 
knowledge. If the company has joined a sustainable business network, 
it’s dedicated to learning about other companies’ best practices and 
reaching out for education and connections in the green commercial 
world.
 
✓ Its industry-specific certification status: Is your supplier certified by 
one of the organizations listed in the earlier “Surveying your certifica-
tion options by industry sector” section? If your supplier’s industry 
isn’t mentioned there, you can still find the certification potential within 
your supplier’s specific industry by doing an Internet search for “green,” 
“certification,” and the type of industry.
Consider creating a preferred policy for suppliers working toward improved 
human and environmental practices. You may choose to quantify your 
supplier-assessment process by allocating points for formal environmental 
programs, active waste- and energy-reduction programs, certifications from 
reliable organizations, or work that they do with their own suppliers. You can 
even spark suppliers’ interest in greening their own companies by offering to 
share sustainable educational resources. Let them know you’ll do everything 
you can to help them get on the green bandwagon.

300
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
However you decide to proceed, make sure that members of your supply 
chain understand what your sustainability goals are and let them know how 
many points in your preferred policy are based on their diligence in helping 
you reach your targets (reduced energy, decreased packaging, or alternative 
components, for example).
 
Because greening your supply chain involves more than just your direct 
suppliers, be sure to ask whether your vendors use foreign manufacturers. 
Suppliers that aren’t diligent about ensuring workplace standards are upheld 
throughout their supply chain can be negatively linked to your company, 
particularly if they suffer from adverse media exposure.
Some questions you may want to ask suppliers with foreign manufacturing 
partners include the following:
 
✓ Are you affiliated with the United Nations Global Compact? If they’re 
participating in it, that’s a good sign they’re committed to social and 
environmental responsibility.
 
✓ Do you have a written policy indicating compliance with applicable 
ILO conventions? The ILO emphasizes helping people attain decent work 
(a phrase that addresses workers’ aspirations for opportunity, income, 
workplace fairness, personal development, and gender equality). 
A written policy statement shows commitment to global sustainable 
development and reflects suppliers’ understanding of the social aspect 
of the triple bottom line.
 
✓ Does your purchasing policy favor suppliers that are compliant with 
SA8000 or ISO 14001 standards? Suppliers that follow a sustainable 
business model are more advantageous for a number of reasons. In 
particular, those that have attained certification pose much less risk for 
your company because you can rest assured that they’re socially and/or 
environmentally astute. If your suppliers have been certified under the 
SA800 standard in particular, you know they’re maintaining reasonable 
evidence that companies throughout their supply chains are complying 
with the procedures as well.
Every situation is unique and many of your raw materials may not have 
multiple sources, but if you’re truly committed to greening your business, 
you should share your vision and do all you can to engage not only your sup-
pliers but also your suppliers’ suppliers in your programs designed to green 
your value chain. The talking points you use to persuade your supply chain 
partners that sustainability is a compelling business model are the same ones 
you use to engage the top dogs at your company: enhanced revenue through 

301
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know the Standards and Certifications
new green consumers, reduced expenses through ecoefficiencies, decreased 
risk to volatile energy and raw material supplies, improved employee produc-
tivity, increased innovation, and enhanced access to capital markets. See 
Chapter 1 for the full scoop on each of these points.
 
If, despite all of your efforts, you find that some suppliers are resistant to 
embracing ecochange, you may need to consider how exposed you’ll be in 
the future to sourcing materials and components from vendors that are 
ill-prepared for a carbon- and resource-constrained 21st century. When you’re 
struggling to decide whether to stay in a particular supply chain partnership, 
ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ Is it worth it to continue to pursue a relationship that may lead my 
company to more risk down the road?
 
✓ Might my company’s time be better spent developing supply chain 
relationships with like-minded vendors?
 
Many companies are performing environmental audits on their supply chain 
partners and outlining basic rules of green conduct to compare suppliers’ 
actions against.

Measuring Results and 
Tweaking Your Plan
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the value of measuring your sustainability progress
▶ Discovering how to compile the data you need
▶ Looking critically at your results and adapting your sustainability plan (if necessary)
G
reening your business practices, like any commercial endeavor, is a 
fluid and dynamic process of setting goals, assessing success, modi-
fying according to new information gleaned, and setting next year’s goals. 
Assessing and communicating the results of your early sustainability projects 
is therefore critical — whether the news is of success or failure. Observation 
and informal conversations, in addition to statistical data, are the tools you 
need to measure the bigger green picture across all parts of your organiza-
tion affected by your sustainability initiatives.
Quite frankly, there’s very little you can’t measure if you know how to appre-
ciate the value of formal assessments and are happy using qualitative (as well 
as quantitative) data. You can pull all the data together and evaluate your 
current progress with an eye toward the future, so read on for the guidance 
you need to start making your sustainability plan even stronger.
Understanding the Function 
of Formal Assessments
You may be wondering why spending time assessing the results of your efforts 
is worthwhile. After all, if one of your goals is to reduce your company’s
waste output and you know that the number of metric tons your company 
puts out is smaller than when you started, why do you need to engage in a 
formal assessment process to showcase those results?

304
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
Well, the short answer is that you want to be able to track how well your 
company is performing in regard to the sustainability plan you created. The 
long answer is that you can use what you find out to do everything from 
rethinking your strategies and reaffirming your goals to cutting programs 
that don’t work and putting more capital into ones that appear to be provid-
ing strong results. And although every business has its own unique identity 
and goals, the purpose of measuring is universal: to see where you’ve been 
and where you’re going.
When you create your sustainability plan, you decide which key performance 
indicators (KPIs) you’ll use to measure the success of your various initia-
tives. In the assessment phase, you simply gather data that applies to those 
KPIs, measure your current results, and compare your current standing to 
your preliminary results from the planning stage. (I explain all the fundamen-
tals of the planning stage, including how to choose KPIs, in Chapter 4.)
This process is very similar to that of conducting employee performance 
evaluations, with new objectives evolving based on the addition of other 
targets and the knowledge gained from the previous year’s efforts. I recom-
mend conducting a full-fledged annual evaluation with interim (preferably 
quarterly) spot checks to give you a heads up about whether you’re heading 
in the right direction with your current actions.
If you happen to be measuring something like the impact of your plant’s 
wastewater on biodiversity, you probably aren’t going to conduct a compre-
hensive analysis on a quarterly basis. Instead, you’re better off taking a few 
random samples for water purity and holding off on the full assessment until 
the end of the fiscal year.
 
Regardless of when you choose to measure, your measurement process 
should focus on
 
✓ Highlighting accomplishments: This portion of the process is about 
digging into your data and finding a reason to smile. If you’re spearhead-
ing your ecoefforts in a concerted way, I bet you’ll find a ton of great 
reasons to pat yourself (and your employees) on the back when you 
review all that measurable data you’ve been accumulating. Accentuating 
your company’s accomplishments is one great reason to measure your 
efforts.
 
✓ Recognizing shortcomings: There is, of course, always room for 
improvement, and looking at measurable data is a terrific way to identify 
the results your company can improve in the future. After all, if you can’t 
come to terms with the actions that need improvement, you’ll never be 
able to rack up more wins in the successes column. Sometimes your best 
accomplishments are the direct results of your failures. Again, taking a 
look at your sustainability plan can point you in the right direction.

 Chapter 15: Measuring Results and Tweaking Your Plan
Highlighting sustainability accomplishments within the current accounting 
system used in North America can be a challenge. Traditional measure-
ments are remiss in culling out data that focuses on sustainability initiatives, 
and often budgeting and financial analysis ignore sustainability implica-
tions. Additionally, financial statements prepared using generally accepted 
accounting principles (or their derivatives) may misguide readers because of 
omissions that greatly influence green decision-making.
 
To fully report on your company’s triple-bottom-line performance (meaning 
your impact on people, planet, and profit), you may want to compile a sus-
tainability report. This document showcases how your business is doing in 
relation to its green goals by disclosing how those goals were established and 
what the key developments and trends over the past year looked like. See 
Chapter 16 for the full scoop on these reports.
Gathering Data
You can use measurements to chart your progress in virtually all priority 
areas of your sustainability plan, including employee training; customer satis-
faction; waste, water, and energy reduction; supply chain greening; and com-
munity outreach. However, you must have something quantifiable in hand 
before you can measure it. That’s precisely where data collection comes in.
Collect data using a systematic method and design process to ensure that 
the data is reliable. If you’ve created a sustainability plan, chances are you’re 
already well on the way to accumulating baseline data. Now your task is to 
analyze the results from your various initiatives to see how you’re coming 
on your goals. The next few sections help you break down data-collection 
responsibilities, ensure you have data you can work with, and measure your 
progress toward achieving your goals.
Assigning responsibilities 
for data collection
Theoretically, each specific sustainability initiative at your company is being 
implemented by a project team that formed during the planning process 
and is charged with meeting prioritized goals (see Chapter 4 for more on 
project teams). Each individual team is therefore responsible for collecting 
data related to its assigned initiative. Team members may in turn decide to 
appoint another logical assessment overseer. For example, if mitigating the 
effects of stormwater runoff is a priority area, the project team in charge of 
that initiative may have a hydrologist or facilities expert measure and assess 
runoff before and after the new swales are constructed.

306
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
Assigning accountability for these tasks depends on the expertise of individual 
project team members, the availability of consultants, and your company’s 
resource constraints. Likewise, doling out specific data-collection assignments 
depends on what you’re measuring.
If you want to measure something that’s fairly easy for an accountant to 
handle (like charting electric bills on a spreadsheet), you have a couple 
choices. If a member of the accounting department is on your project team, 
then you’re in luck! If not, you can always request that a member of your 
accounting staff work with the most logical project team candidate to help 
him or her develop the simple skills needed to read and chart the business’s 
electric bills.
 
If your company is quite small and you don’t have an accounting staff, per-
haps your external CPA firm or bookkeeper can help you out. Just be sure to 
include any potential expense in your sustainability-budgeting process.
Some assignments, however, by their very nature need to be disbursed 
among a few folks. For example, gathering employee satisfaction surveys 
is most logically handled by having project team members administer the 
survey within their respective departments. One person from the team can 
then be delegated to compile all the data.
Lastly, some data collection is clearly beyond the scope of any in-house 
capacity. Unless you have an ecologist on your staff, identifying exactly 
how your local watershed’s flora and fauna is going to be affected by adding 
scrubbers to your manufacturing facility is probably way out of your knowl-
edge realm. Hiring an ecologist to help you identify which tests will most 
accurately depict and measure that impact is probably your only choice. Of 
course, you want to make sure that what you’re measuring is an attainable 
proposition.
Acquiring data that’s reliable 
and measurable
At this stage, you simply measure the same things you did before you imple-
mented your sustainability initiatives, back when you did your baseline 
assessment of your key performance indicators (KPIs). Because your plan 
includes all sorts of KPIs and goals, you can measure everything from how 
much energy you saved in the company fleet by purchasing hybrids to how 
many trees you saved by converting to 100-percent post-consumer-waste 
paper products. These goals, which are set up to be measured over time, 
help keep your assertions that you’re going green honest and credible.

307
 Chapter 15: Measuring Results and Tweaking Your Plan
 
When gathering data, use a wide variety of data sources, such as environmen-
tal and employee training records, purchasing records, financial reports, 
inventory/production reports, interviews, regulatory commentary, employee 
and customer satisfaction surveys, and so on. For quantitative data, the KPIs 
you decided on when creating your sustainability plan will show you directly 
where you need to pull the numbers from.
 
Sometimes, however, the data you need to collect isn’t quantitative — rather, 
it’s qualitative, which means you need to quantify the results as much as is 
feasible without skewing the data so that you can better measure and plot 
your progress. You usually have to go through this conversion with social 
goals because you’re measuring opinions, not numerical data. So how do you 
gather the information and convert it to a format you can measure? Create 
informal surveys and interviews to gather human responses to existing pro-
grams and proposed solutions.
When attempting to gather data regarding stakeholder satisfaction with a 
certain program, frame your questions so that interviewees may scale their 
responses (a 5 means strongly agree, a 1 means strongly disagree, and so 
on), thereby allowing for some objective reporting on qualitative data. Be 
concise. For example, if you’re gathering workers’ thoughts on a proposed 
pay-for-performance plan, don’t just ask people what they think. Instead, 
conduct a short survey of pointed and direct questions that will allow you to 
determine whether your compensation plan modifications accomplish what 
the employees hope they will.
For example, say your CPA firm has designed an online tax-interview process 
that replaces the need for your client to drive to the firm and physically meet 
with her accountant to hand over documents and discuss tax-planning issues. 
Your firm estimates this online procedure will reduce 100 tons of greenhouse 
gas emissions in the upcoming tax season. To assess clients’ responses to this 
program, first ask questions about program specifics and then request clients 
rate their satisfaction with these elements on a scale of 1 to 5.
 
Whether you’re using existing data (like how much you already drive the com-
pany car) or need to collect new data (like how much you’ve saved on energy 
bills since installing efficient light bulbs and programmable thermostats), 
remember that data integrity is essential for any report to be credible. Your 
data must be authentic and easy to read.
 
When possible, use a third party to ensure the data’s integrity by involving 
outside objective documentation in your data compilation. For example, 
energy bills showing decreased kilowatt usage are based on verifiable third-
party data (the energy provider’s invoices). An informal supplier interview 
conducted by your purchasing agent isn’t dependent on a third-party verifier. 
If, however, you ask your suppliers to be in a focus group facilitated by a coor-
dinator, then your survey falls under the independent-verifier category.

308
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
Measuring progress based on 
the data you’ve gathered
Measuring your sustainability efforts in order to gauge your progress toward 
achieving your green goals is a process that involves many different players 
within your organization. Each department plays a part in your company’s 
overall sustainability picture, especially the accounting or finance depart-
ment. The accounting staff’s function within a green business is one of the 
least defined or developed elements, but it’s also one of the most important 
when it comes to measuring data.
 
Identifying the impact of sustainability initiatives on budget, as well as creat-
ing formal financial statements, is a critical job that lands squarely on your 
accounting staffers’ shoulders. Their task is to design and test new measure-
ment tools needed to assess environmental and social performance, in con-
gruence with the project team overseeing a particular initiative.
Practices vary widely, depending on what specifically your company is 
measuring and what your current accounting information system looks like. 
However, there are some common first-step efforts in this area. Many compa-
nies engaged in sustainable development target energy-efficiency measures 
because of their immediate financial and environmental impact. Therefore, 
measuring electricity and gas usage (in both dollars of expense and kilowatts 
used per month) is important and fairly easy to chart.
After you have a handle on tracking the monthly numbers over time (your 
baseline and after six months of energy-conservation initiatives), you can 
start to play with how to present your data to show impact. Common choices 
include percentage change over current month of the prior year (comparing 
October to October, for example) or as a percentage of gross sales. You can 
also use this practice to follow trends for water and waste. As you begin to 
have a feel for the impact of your initiatives, you’ll be better able to tighten 
future goals.
 
Regardless of how you choose to measure the data your project team has 
gathered, assess whether the initiative
 
✓ Has a measurable sustainability impact: This point is kind of a no-
brainer. After all, you can’t gauge the effects of a particular initiative on 
your triple bottom line if it doesn’t have a measurable characteristic 
that you can tie to sustainability. As stakeholders begin to figure out 
what a green company is, your initiatives should help them see what 
the ramifications of going green are for your company’s pocketbook, its 
ecological impact, and its influence on people. Not every initiative will 

309
 Chapter 15: Measuring Results and Tweaking Your Plan
touch on all three elements of the triple bottom line (people, planet, and 
profit), but when determining how to assess your initiatives, keep these 
elements in mind. For example, replacing the carpet in your office facil-
ity is all well and good, but you’ll have difficulty tying that initiative to 
your sustainability efforts unless you can measure the improved health 
and efficiency of employees thanks to your new PVC-free carpet tiles.
 
✓ Can be replicated: The cost savings associated with crafting initiatives 
that can be used in multiple situations is what makes this consideration 
important. Initiatives that can be modified slightly and used in many 
different scenarios are more valuable to a company. The less time you 
have to spend reinventing the wheel the better so that you can devote 
more energy and focus to furthering your company’s sustainability 
progress. For instance, evaluate whether that education program you 
designed to teach your suppliers about green practices can be used with 
your employees and community members as well. If so, this initiative is 
more desirable than one that has no applicability beyond its singular, 
targeted purpose.
 
✓ Contains achievements that are easy to describe: Part of compiling 
data and measuring your results involves looking at initiatives with a 
critical eye toward whether you can tout your company’s ecosuccess 
in that arena to an audience of stakeholders that has a differing degree 
of knowledge about all things green. Determine whether the initiative in 
question has either obvious results or results that can be made more 
obvious to stakeholders by tying them to traditional business measure-
ments or by using charts and other tools.
 
✓ Has raised the social and environmental consciousness of the organiza-
tion: Successful initiatives need to yield tangible results and should con-
tribute to cultural shift. Poor initiatives like esoteric production process 
changes that no one understands won’t generate the buzz you want. On 
the other hand, successful initiatives often spawn water-cooler talk over 
time, which is where that qualitative data comes into play. If you’re hear-
ing more people talking about the triple-bottom-line benefits of recycling 
or using alternative transportation, then you know the initiative in ques-
tion has stirred the green consciousness of your employee base.
Here’s a comprehensive example: If one of your company’s goals is to reduce 
stormwater runoff by 40 percent (so as to preserve groundwater quality in 
the region of your facility), you’d do the following:
 
✓ Assess whether you met the goal. To do this, you’d measure current 
stormwater runoff and compare it to the runoff you measured during 
your earlier baseline assessment, which was done before the installation 
of your new graywater system.

310
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
✓ Gauge the triple-bottom-line impact of your progress. In this case, 
you’d look at the reduced environmental degradation and the fact that 
your investment costs in the graywater system are being recaptured 
by decreased water costs and improved water quality that’s better for 
people’s health.
 
✓ Determine whether you can replicate this same initiative elsewhere. 
Evaluate whether you can apply this initiative to other facilities you own 
or whether you can share this data with your suppliers to build a case 
for their own conversions.
Social footprinting makes its debut
Many folks in the sustainable business world 
have long (and eagerly I might add) awaited 
the release of the Social Footprint, a measure-
ment and reporting tool that appears destined 
to become as common as carbon footprinting 
within the next five years or so. And guess 
what. It’s now available to help you quantify 
your business’s social sustainability. In other 
words, it can help you determine your com-
pany’s impact on society.
What the Ecological Footprint was to measur-
ing organizational impact on natural capital, 
the Social Footprint is to measuring impact on 
anthro capital, defined as the basic facets that 
humans rely on to enhance their well-being.
A company that’s committed to improving its 
social bottom line should target initiatives 
(developed as part of the sustainability-plan-
ning process described in Chapter 4) aimed at 
improving the following three facets of anthro 
capital:
 ✓ Human capital: This facet refers to all 
activities that affect personal health, skill, 
human rights, and so on. Essentially, it has 
to do with a company’s direct contributions 
to its workers.
 ✓ Social capital: This facet refers to a com-
pany’s impact on social networks like 
educational groups or child care co-ops. 
It’s concerned with a company’s direct 
contribution to groups that are extraneous 
to your organization, such as nonprofits 
(see Chapter 12 for more on partnering up 
with nonprofits).
 ✓ Constructed capital: This facet refers to 
the material things people build, such as 
infrastructures and technologies, and the 
choices they make regarding whether to 
build and of what quality to build to (for 
instance, going whole-hog green or shoot-
ing for as cheap as you can make the proj-
ect). Constructed capital impact favors a 
company that considers existing rail for 
distribution versus putting up a new distri-
bution facility, for example.
The Social Footprint takes a quotients approach, 
which means that it defines a need for improved 
social capital. For example, say your textile firm 
has identified development and administration of 
an adult literacy project as its charitable giving 
target. The program requires $75,000 per year 
in funding (the denominator), and you’re able to 
provide $50,000 for the project (the numerator).
In this example, the quotient approach returns 
a ratio of .67 (50,000/75,000). Anything less than 1.0 
is unsustainable because there’s a shortfall. 
Theoretically, this method can be used to 
quantify all areas of anthro capital to define 
minimum required needs and which activities 
are unsustainable.

311
 Chapter 15: Measuring Results and Tweaking Your Plan
Using Your Measurements to Make 
Strategic Plan Changes
After you’ve measured your company’s progress toward various sustain-
ability goals, what exactly do you do with all that info? Present your data 
(even if you just share the numbers with yourself at this point) so that you 
can take stock of what they mean to your organization. Doing so allows you 
to apply what you know about your sustainability efforts to tweaking vital 
components of your business operation, such as your budget, as well as your 
sustainability plan for the future.
 
Take into consideration how the numbers you came up with for each set of 
data (whether goal-related or otherwise) affect how your company is going to 
move forward with meeting its identified sustainability goals. That may mean 
revisiting your original goals in light of the success (or failure) of specific ini-
tiatives, resources needed, new impending regulations, competitive forces, 
market changes, or altered corporate priorities.
If a particular goal was attained, the project team whose initiative was 
responsible for the achievement should identify the next period’s goals to 
continue on the sustainability course charted by your green team during the 
planning process.
If the goal wasn’t met, can you figure out why not? Determining whether the 
initiative was off-target or whether the KPI used to measure it was inappro-
priate can be particularly trying. I recommend your project team start by 
gathering qualitative data (through interviews) as to how stakeholders and 
participants viewed the success of the initiative.
For example, if the recycling effort just never took off at your regional chain 
of nursing homes, the people to ask what worked and what didn’t are the 
residents, staff members, and facilities workers at each of the homes. If the 
numbers you’re charting show an unsuccessful program but the participants 
all feel that the initiative was of high quality, then you should turn to the KPI as 
the culprit. Maybe measuring reduced waste stream in terms of tonnage isn’t 
indicative of success or failure because of new statutes requiring disposable 
bedding.
 
Assessing where an initiative has gone awry isn’t a linear process by any 
means. The interaction of lots of variables (which some attribute to luck or 
good timing) can play into the success or failure of any business goal. Common 
mistakes with sustainability initiatives include setting overly ambitious goals. 
If progress looked promising but the big goal wasn’t met, maybe a phased-in 
approach is most appropriate. Ask yourself whether the resources you needed 
to attain the goal were adequate. Did you have a hard time soliciting buy-in from 
folks who were essential to making the initiative work? Perhaps situations out-
side your control simply affected the attainability of the goal in a negative way.

312
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
Make sure to include any outside consultants who helped in the measurement 
process to get their opinion on whether the initiative has innate problems or 
whether the correct KPIs are being used. These experts can often guide your 
project team to consider facets they otherwise wouldn’t have.
If you determine that an initiative has potential but that the KPI used to 
measure success is off-base, you should have some experience under your 
belt now that may help redirect you to another KPI. If that one is completely 
unrelated to the first, you may need to accumulate baseline data again. If the 
new KPI is in the same scope as the old (albeit unsuccessful) one, you may 
determine that a shortened time is necessary to accumulate baseline data 
(so perhaps you opt for charting employee turnover for three months rather 
than collecting employee satisfaction surveys for six months).
Maybe one of your prioritized goals is to eliminate all toxic raw material 
components from your product line. Say your elimination efforts come in at 
60 percent rather than the full 100 percent you were hoping for. First, make 
sure that that goal wasn’t overly ambitious to begin with. A 60-percent reduc-
tion is still significant, so analyze your data to determine whether the trend 
lines look like they’re continuing down the path that will lead to more results 
in the future. Perhaps you find that although you’ve been diligently work-
ing with suppliers to meet this goal, one of your key suppliers is struggling 
to find a high-quality replacement for the toxic raw material it sells to you. 
Therefore, maybe progress isn’t charted only by elimination percentage, but 
by the number of suppliers making efforts to find alternative materials. You 
may need to widen your parameters in order to reassess and modify your 
goals accordingly.
 
The road to measuring success doesn’t come to a dead end after you collect 
data, measure your business’s performance against it, and decide how you’ll 
adjust your efforts for the future. Now you need to think about how to pres-
ent your results and findings to the people they affect the most — namely key 
stakeholders, including shareholders, creditors, employees, suppliers, and 
customers. Chapter 16 guides you in creating reports that effectively inform 
your stakeholders of your efforts and engage them with your sustainability 
vision.

R
emember getting a report card in grade school? Running home to find 
your mom sitting at the kitchen table with that look on her face was 
always a nerve-racking experience, even if you were an A student. Although 
you sweated it a bit, those reports helped her see how you were progress-
ing in school and whether you were making the right choices when it came 
to your studies. Now that you’re all grown up and working on greening your 
business, you have the opportunity to self-report regarding your company’s 
ecoprogress. You can use this reporting mechanism to provide a snapshot to 
yourself and your stakeholders showing exactly how you’re doing in relation 
to attaining the goals of your overall sustainability plan. Note: Even if sustain-
ability reporting is a ways off for your company, you should clearly define it 
as an objective at some point in the future.
The Basics of Sustainability Reporting
Before you jump right into the wonderful world of sustainability reporting, 
you first need to understand the concept of it. By finding out more about the 
what and why of this type of reporting, you can make stronger decisions when 
you sit down to create your business’s account of its green performance.
Sustainability reporting helps make the correlation between your business’s 
financial success and its environmental and social performance. A sustainabil-
ity report is an objective document that details your triple-bottom-line perfor-
mance (meaning your impact on people, planet, and profit; see Chapter 1 for 

314
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
more on the triple bottom line) over a fixed time period, usually a year. This 
report goes by different names, such as triple-bottom-line report, corporate 
citizenship report, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) report.
 
Thinking in a big picture sort of way, an effective sustainability report leaves 
readers with an understanding of what the plans for your company were in 
the year being covered and how well you did in achieving those goals. A good 
internal sustainability-reporting system measures and reports with due dili-
gence and a constant eye toward improvement.
 
Most companies report on their CSR endeavors on an annual basis; some 
choose to offer biannual reports. When trying to determine when you should 
issue your sustainability report, why not coordinate with your financial 
reporting cycle?
The following sections delve into the topic of sustainability reporting in 
greater detail, including what reports usually include and why these docu-
ments are so valuable to your corporate greening efforts.
Understanding the functions 
of sustainability reports
Current traditional financial statements aren’t designed to capture the infor-
mation you need to assess your organization’s sustainability performance, 
which is why sustainability reports are important if you want to showcase 
your efforts (and you should!).
A sustainability report gives your stakeholders a peek at your overall triple-
bottom-line strategy and management approach to improving financial, 
social, and environmental performance so they can understand how you 
ascertain whether you’re meeting your goals and whether trends are improv-
ing. Following are some of the myriad specific reasons stakeholders may use 
a sustainability report:
 
✓ Benchmarking: To see how your performance stacks up in comparison 
to existing external standards, codes, and initiatives.
 
✓ Gauging sphere of influence: To identify how deeply ingrained sustain-
ability consciousness is in your company via its actions. Stakeholders 
want to get an idea whether all of your company’s employees are striving 
to have a positive impact on society through your business and at what 
level your business is involved with external organizations that are com-
mitted to being a part of the paradigm shift toward greener businesses.

315
 Chapter 16: Creating Sustainability Reports That Wow Stakeholders
 
✓ Judging comparability: To seek information so they can compare 
your triple-bottom-line performance with that of similar companies. 
Stakeholders want to be able to assess you in comparison to other like-
kind companies, meaning those that are the same size, target the same 
demographics, and/or belong to the same industry sector.
 
✓ Assessing opportunities and risks: To understand how you’re positioned 
to take advantage of opportunities. Seemingly negative trends such as 
skyrocketing oil costs and climate change actually create business oppor-
tunity. Conversely, these same issues pose risks. In-tune-with-the-times 
stakeholders want to know how you’re reducing your company’s expo-
sure to variables beyond your control.
Recognizing the value of 
reporting your progress
More than anything, sustainability reporting helps your investors and stake-
holders track your sustainability efforts. Granted, investors are very con-
cerned with what your past environmental and social performance looks like. 
But they’re also super interested in how you might respond to future scenar-
ios, such as wildly fluctuating fossil fuel prices or the limited availability of 
raw materials. This knowledge gives them an indication of your future ability 
to flourish in a very uncertain world and provides them with the basis they 
need to determine whether they want to enter into (or continue) a relation-
ship with your business.
Providing sustainability reports to your stakeholders also enhances your cor-
porate image as a transparent company that’s dedicated to measuring and 
communicating its sustainability progress and maintaining a high level of CSR 
accountability. By creating a reporting system, you not only augment your sus-
tainability work but also keep it in the forefront of your stakeholders’ minds.
With recent research linking companies that perform socially and environ-
mentally with those that perform well financially, expect to see your inves-
tors, creditors, suppliers, and the like asking for sustainability reports in the 
future. They want to know what’s going on in your firm past the details avail-
able on your financial statements. After all, free markets flourish in great part 
due to investors’ reliance on accurate and timely information, and a sustain-
ability report is where they can get just that.
 
Lots of folks think sustainability reports are used only as external communi-
cation pieces. Nothing could be farther from the truth! The folks who benefit 
from sustainability reports the most are you and your employees. Many stud-
ies have shown that sustainability reporting yields significant internal ben-
efits. Remember the old business adage “what gets measured gets managed”? 

316
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
It’s a spot-on comment when it comes to integrating sustainability reporting 
within your company. In the process of creating a report, you find that you’re 
addressing not only what’s getting measured but also how you’re tackling 
improvement in that arena. You also begin tightening up your action plan to 
improve your company’s sustainability performance.
Depending on where your employees’ interests lie, a sustainability report can 
provoke stimulating ideas for them to become further involved with corpo-
rate sustainability initiatives. Areas in which an employee can jump right in 
with ideas and energy include
 
✓ Identifying ways to serve new and greener customers
 
✓ Expanding your product line to embrace more sustainable products or 
services
 
✓ Exploring ways that suppliers can be a part of ecoprogress
 
✓ Suggesting potential modifications to the area in which they operate
 
✓ Becoming engaged in small daily office behavior modifications that 
result in overall improved corporate environmental performance
 
Employee buy-in is part of Sustainability 101. Without it, you’re destined to 
fail. But organizational communication can often be a challenging proposal at 
best — and downright nonexistent at worst. Because your sustainability 
report brings together the rich package of your core commitments, programs, 
initiatives, and objectives, all bound together by a clear overview of what 
you’re succeeding at and what you’re not, be sure to share this powerful tool 
with your employees.
 
Another great benefit of creating a sustainability report is the fact that you can 
use its content for other purposes, namely as a corporate marketing piece. As 
you spearhead the sustainability-reporting process, use what you discover 
about your business to spread the word to potential suppliers, investors, and 
customers.
Visualizing the big picture: An overview 
of the primary disclosures
As you go about preplanning, designing, writing, and publishing your sustain-
ability report, you may want to obtain some direction from the guidelines 
promoted by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI; a nonprofit organization 
that develops and disseminates sustainability-reporting standards globally). 
The GRI, based in Holland, is the internationally recognized patriarch of sus-
tainability reporting.

317
 Chapter 16: Creating Sustainability Reports That Wow Stakeholders
There’s no right or wrong way to draft your sustainability report; the GRI 
simply offers guidance, inspiration, and structure for writing and designing 
such reports. Rather than mandates, this global organization provides the 
now universally accepted framework that can help get you started. You can 
modify this framework and use it as a basis for preparing something meaning-
ful for either your family-owned vineyard or your small indie newspaper.
The most recent version of the GRI’s sustainability-reporting framework, the 
G3 Guidelines, is designed to
 
✓ Outline principles for describing report content and ensuring informa-
tion is credible
 
✓ Identify key performance indicators and other items of disclosure
 
✓ Provide guidance on specific technical topics
Why traditional financial statements don’t 
work for sustainability reporting
Financial statements crafted around generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have 
been the norm for reporting and assessing a 
company’s performance for over a century. Yet 
these statements provide very little evaluative 
potential for the reader regarding a company’s 
social and environmental performance. In fact, 
they can even mislead the uninformed reader.
Most shortcomings inherent in GAAP-based 
financial statements are due to the fact that 
natural capital or ecological services often 
aren’t given any value. Consider some of these 
aberrations:
 ✓ The value of the services that a wetland 
provides, such as flood control, water purifi-
cation, and biodiversity enhancement goes 
unrecorded as an asset on a traditional 
balance sheet. Instead, it’s paved over with 
an asphalt parking lot (that’s made up of 
petroleum and bitumen no less) to handle 
increased traffic to a new retail outlet. The 
loss never hits the income statement.
 ✓ Product costs for naturally harvested prod-
ucts are often grossly undervalued. For 
example, seafood product prices incor-
porate all the overhead associated with 
harvest, but they assign no cost to the raw 
material itself, skewing free market supply-
and-demand forces. This fact has led to a 
dangerous global depletion of fisheries.
 ✓ Dumping toxic pesticides and petroleum-
based fertilizers on agricultural land 
increases yield, which is reflected as an 
increase in sales on the income state-
ment. What isn’t reflected is a commensu-
rate liability on the balance sheet showing 
future groundwater remediation costs or 
increased exposure to lawsuits due to rami-
fications on human health.

Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
Although you have wide latitude when designing your report, the GRI suggests 
companies include the following bigger-picture disclosures in order to pro-
duce a strong sustainability report:
 
✓ Corporate strategy and analysis: Feature statements from the most 
senior executives in the business regarding the relevance and impor-
tance of sustainability to the organization. This analysis should cover 
trends, variables, risks, key achievements, and lessons learned. Major 
challenges and opportunities for the upcoming period should also be 
addressed.
 
✓ Organizational profile: Introduce your readers to the overall context 
in which you’re operating. Include where you operate, what type of 
legal entity you are, and a quick overview of what you do. Also cover 
where your offices are located, what your core operational areas are, 
and what’s happening with your research and development endeavors. 
Finally, consider whether you’re embracing any guiding sustainability 
standards (see Chapter 14 for an overview of these).
 
✓ Report parameters: Provide readers with an overview as to how you’re 
going to organize the topics you want to address. Let them know the 
scope of the information included, the reporting period, any changes 
in reporting style from the previous report, and the data-measurement 
techniques and models used. This disclosure should also feature a brief 
overview of the organization’s management approach to each of the per-
formance areas.
 
✓ Governance, commitment, and engagements: Inform readers how the 
organization is governed, who the highest sustainability-decision-maker 
is, and how stakeholders can provide recommendations. The sustainabil-
ity principles you’re adhering to and the networking bodies your com-
pany is a member of should be disclosed under this umbrella as well.
 
✓ Categories of sustainable business along with key performance indica-
tors (KPIs): Address the following six categories:
 
• Environmental
 
• Human rights
 
• Labor practices and decent work
 
• Product responsibility
 
• Governance
 
• Economics
 
 For each category, use KPIs to help stakeholders assess how well your 
organization is doing in meeting its social, ecological, and economic 
goals. Your KPIs can be either quantitative or qualitative (or both, if 
you prefer). Either way, they denote how you’re going to measure the 
accomplishment of your goals in each area of the triple bottom line.

319
 Chapter 16: Creating Sustainability Reports That Wow Stakeholders
 
✓ Management approach: Provide your readers with an overview as to 
how you manage the sustainability topics you’re addressing. Will KPIs 
be used to assess success? What training and awareness programs do 
you have surrounding the issue, and does your company have estab-
lished policies regarding the category? How does your company develop 
programs, policies, and goals surrounding sustainability performance?
 
To access a handy two-page reference guide that walks you through the 
details of these disclosures, visit www.globalreporting.org. Hold your 
mouse over the Reporting Framework tab at the top of the page and click 
G3 Guidelines on the drop-down menu. On that page, click the More G3 
Resources link and then click the G3 quick reference sheet link that follows 
the bulleted list.
Getting into the nitty-gritty 
details of report structure
Sustainability reports vary widely because every company presents its con-
tent in a way that makes sense for that particular business. Also, sometimes 
constraints — a lack of resources, data availability, and the like — may dictate 
how the actual document is laid out.
 
Regardless of the various factors in play, your sustainability report should 
highlight each element of the triple bottom line (people, planet, and profit). It 
should also include the following specific items:
 
✓ A table of contents: This overview of the document’s setup is essential, 
especially for stakeholders who are new to sustainability reports. A 
reader should easily be able to find the primary disclosures described in 
the preceding section.
 
✓ Commentary and overview from the board and/or top management: 
This section is a direct report from the perspective of executive manage-
ment and the board chair. It may contain a review of the company’s sus-
tainability vision and strategy. Just be sure to address accomplishments 
and challenges in each of the triple-bottom-line areas (social, environ-
mental, and economic) from the company leaders’ points of view.
 
✓ An executive summary: A condensed version of the whole report, an 
executive summary includes
 
• Major developments and trends
 
• A timeline of past events and future goals
 
• Identification of external variables impacting sustainable devel-
opment (such as political movements or significant regulatory, 
market, or social reform)

320
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
✓ A rundown of stakeholders: Describe each of the parties affected by 
your sustainability efforts. Be sure to include commentary on your cus-
tomers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, creditors, and community 
groups, as well as the organizations you’re partnering with to achieve 
your goals.
 
✓ A description of core developments and trends: This portion of your 
sustainability report centers on the most crucial components of your 
sustainability progress. Identify key internal and external developments. 
If you’ve been tracking particular KPIs over time (such as number of 
customer complaints, percentage of staff attending multicultural training 
sessions, and so on), show them in an easy-to-read chart or line graph. 
Make sure to not only present data but to also comment on the ethical, 
commercial, and/or ecological aspects and implications of that data.
 
✓ A comparison of benchmarks and targets: Help readers see what indi-
cators are being measured against and how you’re setting your targets. 
For example, if the trade association for your industry sector releases 
customer satisfaction survey results, you can use this as a point of 
reference to discuss how well your company is meeting consumers’ 
expectations. Voilà! You can now easily segue into a rundown of the sus-
tainability goals you’ve established as they pertain to consumers’ needs 
for the upcoming year.
The preceding isn’t really an earth-shattering list, considering that it looks 
suspiciously like the early days when generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples were being designed to guide the content and format of financial state-
ments. But it’s important to keep in mind as you set about identifying the 
who, what, when, where, and why to include in your sustainability report.
 
As for how many pages to take up with these nitty-gritty details, there’s really 
no minimum or maximum number. Although the issues are often complex and 
interconnected, overanalyzing or exploring every facet of an issue is certain to 
confuse sustainability-reporting newbies, so you may want to operate under 
the theory that less is more.
Preparing to Write Your Report
All well-executed business endeavors require a planning stage, and sustain-
ability reporting is no different. Start off by identifying who’s going to be 
involved (green team members, accounting staff, marketing folks, product 
design engineers, and so on). If you’ve never been through the process 
before, then envisioning who all will have an impact on your report may be 
difficult. From an overview standpoint, try to think more holistically rather 
than narrowly as to who all may be required. Then check out the next few 
sections for further direction on setting a budget for the reporting process, 
taking advantage of reporting frameworks, and singling out core develop-
ments and trends to highlight in your report.

321
 Chapter 16: Creating Sustainability Reports That Wow Stakeholders
Creating a budget for the 
reporting process
Because you have a vested interest in producing a sustainability report 
year after year, you want to create a budget for the reporting process. A 
sustainability-reporting budget primarily includes employee time; in certain 
situations, it takes direct financial resources into account in the form of con-
sultants to help you with data identification, procurement, and compilation.
 
You’ll need to hire a consultant if you plan on measuring and reporting on 
greenhouse gas emissions by type, waste streams by category, water or soil 
analysis, materials testing, and the like. Basically, measuring anything that 
appears scientifically complex or unattainable with internal expertise may 
require the assistance of an outside consultant. Chapter 3 tells you what to 
look for in a qualified consultant and how to find one.
Compile a tracking sheet to log internal folks’ time. Also, be sure to set up a 
mechanism within your accounting department so you can determine how 
much a sustainability report costs you to produce. You’ll probably involve 
employees from many departments in its production, so think holistically 
here. Depending on your organization, you’ll probably need to accumulate 
time logs from
 
✓ Accounting staff: These people typically coordinate everyone else’s 
efforts. They compile information, fit it into the chosen report format, 
and keep everyone on track with their assigned tasks.
 
✓ Operations and purchasing folks: They help you gather data as to your 
facility’s energy and water usage, waste streams, and purchasing poli-
cies. Because they work closely with suppliers, they can also highlight 
those vendors that may have human rights and/or child labor issues.
 
✓ Human resource personnel: These folks are helpful when compiling 
data related to training hours, discrimination lawsuits, workforce cat-
egorization, and benefits.
 
✓ Marketing staff: These creative minds can provide you with info on 
product labeling, compliance with marketing-communication laws, and 
voluntary industry standards. They may also serve as the central hub in 
your organization for conducting customer satisfaction surveys.
 
✓ Information technology (IT) whizzes: These invaluable individuals can 
help you establish a way for those working on the report to communi-
cate and share documents electronically so everyone has access to the 
latest and greatest material.
 
Jot down what you think you’ll need from each department in the way of hours, 
preferably on a monthly basis, and then track the actual hours spent. Of course, 
all you can do right now is guesstimate how much time you’ll need from folks, 
but why not use what you know about the focus areas of your business to help 

322
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
you out? For example, if you’re engaged in heavy life cycle assessment with 
your products (see Chapter 7 for more on this approach to product design), 
you know you’ll need quite a bit of info from your product engineer.
After the first cycle, I promise you’ll have a much better idea of how 
much time preparing your sustainability report is actually going to take. 
Additionally, your data-compilation infrastructure will be in place, so the 
needs for IT time, formatting time, and so on will be greatly reduced (as well 
as the corresponding financial costs).
Obtaining big-picture guidance from other 
businesses and reporting entities
 
Studying other businesses’ reports is one way to find out more about what 
makes a successful sustainability report. For some sustainability-reporting 
inspiration, including ideas on how to present and format your info, check 
out Spheres of Influence, Seventh Generation’s 2007 Corporate Consciousness 
Report. Just go to www.seventhgeneration.com, click the Corporate 
Responsibility link at the bottom of the page, and make your way to the report. 
For a look at a really professional and incredibly well-documented report, 
check out Co-operative Group’s latest CSR report at www.co-operative.
coop/en/corporate. Simply click the Sustainability link toward the top of 
the page to access the 2007/08 report.
Strangely enough, you may find out just as much from an inadequate report 
as a well-done one. Recognizing information gaps and insufficient reporting 
techniques helps you to chart your own course and avoid common mistakes.
 
After taking a look at reports for businesses comparable to your own, you’ll 
start to see some trends in the reporting. All successful reports should have 
the following four governing attributes:
 
✓ Materiality: Is the information in your sustainability report really rel-
evant to the environmental and social issues at hand? Some material 
information may not be available; your system should incorporate a 
way to reflect that. Ensure that the report is complete with regard to all 
sustainability-oriented areas.
 
✓ Standardization: Can an outsider look at your company’s sustainabil-
ity report and easily evaluate it against your competitor’s? Is it pos-
sible to make a solid appraisal as to how you compare to each other? 
Standardization can be particularly challenging to achieve when data is 
aggregated to present different stores or distribution centers all within 
one snapshot.

323
 Chapter 16: Creating Sustainability Reports That Wow Stakeholders
 
✓ Stakeholder inclusiveness: Can the reader easily identify the stakehold-
ers and see that his or her interests and questions have been reasonably 
addressed?
 
✓ External verification: Is there someone besides your company that says 
the information in this document is for real? Can you guarantee that the 
report gives a credible view of your company’s sustainability profile?
 
The field of sustainability reporting is evolving rapidly. There are a plethora 
of different ways of looking at your firm’s green journey and telling your story 
to others. Hence, being creative and visionary while simultaneously imparting 
useful information in a meaningful and user-friendly format is the name of 
the game.
Although not a mandatory report structure, many companies use the cor-
nerstones of the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) sustainability-reporting 
principles in preparing their annual sustainability reports to help identify key 
issues and organize and present data. Why? Because the GRI does an excel-
lent job providing an overview of what to report and how to report it. The 
cornerstones of the GRI’s reporting principles and guidelines provide the 
following suggestions:
 
✓ Showcase your accomplishments and identify your shortcomings. You 
have to be prepared to bare all in this process. You may not want all 
of your stakeholders to know your actual carbon emissions have been 
going up on an annual basis, or that food waste in one of your employee 
cafeterias is around 16 percent. However, transparently identifying all 
of your business’s risks and challenges (as well as its accomplishments 
and opportunities) is the foundation of a truly sustainable business.
 
 Fill your readers in on what programs you have in process, how you’re 
training employees or working with suppliers, where accountability lies in 
your firm, and what applicable certifications and regulations are out there.
 
✓ Identify and address all stakeholders. You must identify and categorize 
all possible stakeholders and show that company representatives have 
made an honest attempt to have open dialogue with all affected parties 
about their concerns and issues regarding the business’s operations.
 
✓ Keep it short, sweet, and relevant. Throwing all the data you can at 
your readers is counter-productive. The information contained within 
your report should be couched within the context of improving sustain-
able performance. Tight correlations between what you’re talking about 
and the company’s triple-bottom-line performance keep stakeholders 
interested, whereas nebulous connections simply puzzle them.

324
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
✓ Present results across the breadth of the value chain. Exploring the full 
scope of impact up and down the value chain in order to convey your 
company’s full sustainability footprint requires pulling it all together for 
a reader. Leaving big gaps out because you don’t know what to report 
on or you haven’t made any progress on an issue doesn’t lend credibility 
to your report. For example, a recent report released by a big account-
ing firm shows that although 90 percent of firms mention climate change 
in their sustainability reports, only 20 percent of them mention it as one 
of their business risks. They focus only on climate change opportunities, 
which clearly doesn’t paint a complete picture.
The GRI’s full sustainability-reporting framework can be a bit overwhelming 
for small or mid-sized enterprises to use because it’s primarily applicable to 
large organizations. That’s why some companies are adopting trimmed-down 
versions of this extensive framework. Affectionately referred to as GRI-Lite, 
these versions embrace the idea of adapting comprehensive GRI standards to 
meet the needs of smaller organizations. GRI-Lite tones down to a less rigor-
ous framework, but it’s a great entry point for a small or mid-sized company 
that’s new to sustainability reporting. The result more accurately reflects 
the unique challenges small companies face, as well as their progress toward 
meaningful change.
Although the GRI isn’t a certifying agency, you can declare the level at which 
you applied GRI standards to your report. Essentially, you can tell your read-
ers whether you’re an advanced reporting entity, one that’s just starting out, 
or one that has some experience (just not a ton). Simply self-declare which 
level (A, B, or C) your report complies with. (Note: You can only declare 
your report at an A+, B+ or C+ level if you’ve worked with a third party to 
verify the authenticity of your data.) Go to www.globalreporting.org/
GRIReports/ApplicationLevels to see how to self-assess which level 
you’re at and don’t be upset if you have to declare at level C your first time 
out the gate. That’s pretty common among sustainability-reporting newbies.
 
Whether you’re working with the full GRI guidelines or the GRI-Lite version, 
the obvious tendency may be to cut and paste them into a spreadsheet and 
start down the list, checking off protocols as you go. However, doing so 
doesn’t promote a systems-based vision for sustainability in your business. 
Use the checklist as a guide for the types of factors your company should con-
sider and report on. Just don’t make it into a glorified sustainability to-do list. 
If you stay in the traditional mode of ticking off items you’ve accomplished, 
you’ll be locked into the old linear model of thinking. Although dotting i’s 
and crossing t’s is good, sustainability integration in your business will only 
be truly successful if you can transcend that approach. So use your report-
ing process to encourage collective thinking about big-picture stuff, like how 
your company can be regenerative, have positive impact on stakeholders, or 
develop employees’ personal sustainable behavior. After all, you don’t want to 
limit future goal-setting or brainstorming sessions with a checklist.

325
 Chapter 16: Creating Sustainability Reports That Wow Stakeholders
 
Ultimately, the reporting systems you design and implement should meet your 
stakeholders’ identified needs (which you discover during the planning pro-
cess described in Chapter 4). If you keep this fact in mind, you’re guaranteed 
to ensure greater transparency, effective responsiveness to stakeholders, and 
improved overall organizational performance.
Identifying core developments and trends
You can’t have an effective sustainability report without clearly defining the 
developments your company has made over the last year and mentioning 
trends you see in relation to your greening efforts. You want to first focus 
on the strides you’ve made that are most important to the success of your 
business. Some examples of developments you can list (as they relate to the 
triple bottom line, of course) are as follows:
 
✓ People: Present your progress toward your established social goals, 
such as enhanced customer reputation, examples of how you’ve helped 
improve human rights and labor standards, involvement in community 
initiatives, and the enhancement and diversification of your workforce.
 
✓ Planet: Outline ecological programs and policies that you’re engaged 
in, such as greenhouse gas or energy audits, water-reduction efforts, 
and waste-minimization projects. Also, list your company’s progress on 
specific targets, such as becoming a paperless office or transitioning 50 
percent of employees to alternative transportation.
 
✓ Profit: Describe key financial strategies that you’re pursuing, such as 
increasing revenues through expanded product lines, entry into new 
markets, enhanced profits, or earnings per share or debt reduction.
 
Make sure to be honest about trends, both positive and negative, so that your 
report’s credibility is strong. For areas where targets haven’t been achieved 
(for example, raw materials waste has decreased 10 percent when the prior 
year’s goal was 18 percent), outline progress toward the goal and detail how 
efforts will be stepped up in the subsequent year to achieve it.
Putting Your Facts and Figures 
into a Presentable Format
The ability to critically reflect on the past year’s performance and set aggres-
sive but achievable targets for the next year should be woven throughout
your sustainability report. Readers should easily see their concerns 
reflected, indicators established, and high-quality, meaningful data gathered 

326
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
to assess how well your business is progressing toward achieving each of its 
goals. Also, an ever-increasing level of sustainability consciousness should be 
reflected in ambitious targets for subsequent periods.
It may seem counterintuitive, but you want to consider adding some of the 
beginning elements of your report at the end of your compiling process. Parts 
such as the table of contents are hard to craft until you know the page loca-
tion of each item. Likewise, the report from top management and the execu-
tive summary, see the earlier “Getting into the nitty-gritty details of report 
structure” section for more on these parts, may be easier to write after you 
know the big picture of your overall report.
 
The support of management is vital to creating a sound sustainability report, 
so keep top management apprised of your report-writing process. That way 
they won’t be surprised when you ask them to craft an executive summary. 
If you’re the top management at your organization, keep in mind that your 
report isn’t complete without the addition of your bird’s eye view from the big 
shot’s chair.
 
In the spirit of sustainability, avoid printing and sending out your report in 
a paper format. Instead, make it available in a standard electronic format, 
such as .pdf, or make it accessible via popular word-processing software. If 
you want to be progressive, you can even prepare your sustainability report 
book-style by using Flash software. Some companies choose to publish their 
comprehensive reports online and include an executive summary, table of key 
ratios, and a management analysis of sustainability strategy in the form of a 
paper report accompanying their annual financial statements.
The following sections highlight how to compile a sustainability report that 
your stakeholders can readily understand.
Making the data easily accessible
When it comes to communicating your data and measurements to the 
decision-makers, advisors, and investors who help make your business hum, 
you have a myriad of options. You can present data in easy-to-read formats, 
such as bar charts or pie graphs, or in a tabular format that allows readers 
to see concrete numbers on an annual basis. Some reports include a simple 
key next to each major development area that shows whether the trend is 
increasing, staying static, or decreasing. If you use benchmarks (which I 
describe in Chapter 4), always be sure to cite their sources.

327
 Chapter 16: Creating Sustainability Reports That Wow Stakeholders
 
A sustainability report with easily accessible info
 
✓ Shows trends in picture form with graphs or charts: When presented 
over time, this information can be used to assess the success of par-
ticular programs or initiatives. For example, you may present a distribu-
tion graph to illustrate employees’ degree of satisfaction with work life. 
What does this ratio look like over the last three years? Or, if you’re just 
starting, provide the data for the current year and identify targets for 
improvement.
 
✓ Compiles complex raw data into easy-to-read tables: The goal of your 
sustainability report is to provide a readable and meaningful overview 
of your sustainability efforts and performance. Thus, more isn’t better in 
this case. Particularly with energy, waste, and water calculations, show-
case your results — not the volumes of data tracking factory waste or 
embedded fuel in raw materials. For all but the biggest die-hards, such 
info is a big yawn (at best) or a deal breaker (at worst).
 
✓ Allows for easy comparison with other companies’ sustainability 
reports: If you can benchmark any aspects of your sustainability perfor-
mance against those of other companies or standard-setting agencies, 
go for it! Showing how you’re doing with minority recruitment is great, 
but establishing that you’re beating statewide norms is potent.
Say you’ve charted data on recycled materials by type for the five preceding 
years. Offer your report’s readers a glimpse of what’s behind the numbers via 
commentary, but also present the actual data in tabular form (see Figure 16-1). 
If part of your sustainability plan is “Being zero waste by 2020” (which some 
progressive companies are in fact stating as a goal), make sure the graphical 
presentation addresses this goal.
 
Having one of these charts for one initiative in each of the cluster groups you 
selected during your sustainability-planning stage (see Chapter 4) is quite 
helpful. Note that not only does this table present recycling trends but it also 
addresses the fact that recycling progress is measured in comparison to tradi-
tional financial data (waste costs as a percentage of sales). Always think out-
side the box when presenting data.
As the saying goes, a picture’s worth a thousand words. Instead of throwing 
a lot of statistics at your readers, show them how your metric tons of recy-
clables on an annual basis are doing with a visual overview. As you can see in 
Figure 16-2, a simple graphical representation helps folks understand the full 
impact of your recycling program.

Anecdotal commentary personalizes data, so incorporate it where appropri-
ate. Tell a story about how you were part of a group that developed an indus-
trial park byproducts market and that’s part of the reason your recycling 
numbers are looking so promising. Fill readers in on how many manufactur-
ing companies have joined the byproducts consortium and the fact that the 
resulting recycling activity has generated eight new jobs within your com-
munity. (See the “Adding commentary to balance out shortcomings” section, 
later in this chapter, for more guidance on this topic.)
Helping stakeholders interpret the data
 
Members of your management team, as well as external stakeholders, need 
to be drawn into trends and analyses that show what you’re trying to do and 
how well you’re doing it. They need you to be to be simple, succinct, and easy 
to understand. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
 
✓ Use internationally recognized measurements. Obscure, industry-
specific metrics aren’t helpful. Instead, refer to easily recognizable 
units, such as tons of carbon dioxide emissions or number of employees 
impacted.
 
✓ Present triple-bottom-line benefits whenever possible (maximizing 
people, planet, and profit simultaneously). For example, say you’ve 
discovered that defect rates have decreased 4 percent since your 
facility-wide lighting retrofit intended to decrease carbon emissions. 
The increased productivity is the result of happier workers responding 
to more natural lighting, and the decreased rework costs will pay for 
the lighting in the next 18 months. A project oriented toward reduced 
energy costs has therefore yielded a triple-bottom-line winner and 
should be conveyed in your report.
 
✓ Tie in social and environmental data to traditional financial trends. 
Everyone is used to tracking gross sales. Take this traditional financial 
info a step further and show quarterly ecological ratios as a portion of 
that. For example, you can show carbon emissions as a percentage of 
gross sales. Couching the info this way is more meaningful than absolute 
data (tons of carbon emitted). It also gets folks familiar with reviewing 
environmentally oriented data and thinking about how that fits with tra-
ditional financial data.
 
✓ Make sure the data are relevant to the goal. If your goal is to minimize 
waste but you’ve just expanded your facility, reporting total waste isn’t 
going to accurately reflect the results of your waste-reduction strategies 
because clearly with more employees, production, and/or square foot-
age, your waste stream will likely increase. Instead, try presenting solid 
waste produced per square foot of commercial space. Plot it on a trend

Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
 
You don’t have to incorporate sustainability metrics in your formal financial 
statements; you can always present them as a supplement to your financial 
statements. Formalizing your data is a great long-term goal, but don’t get 
cowed by such magnanimous change. Instead, work on designing a page of 
key ratios that paints a picture about the triple-bottom-line issues your com-
pany is working on.
Adding commentary to balance 
out shortcomings
 
Your sustainability report can’t be all moonlight and roses. Because businesses 
are run by human beings and sustainability is a journey, you’re going to have 
hiccups along the way to achieving green greatness. Your investors and other 
stakeholders realize that and will appreciate your honesty when mentioning 
your company’s sustainability shortcomings. Tell them the following:
 
✓ What limitations and challenges you faced
 
✓ What lessons you learned
 
✓ How you’re reprioritizing to achieve your goals in the upcoming year
For example, perhaps you didn’t hit your target of lower over-the-road ship-
ping costs. Mention that, but then follow up by saying that you made great 
strides in that department and reduced those costs by 20 percent, partially 
due to incorporating rail in your shipping plan (which leads to reduced carbon 
emissions). The great part about owning up to your company’s shortcomings 
is that you have the opportunity to create some new goals and targets for the 
next year.
 
Many companies fall short with supply chain efforts because of the need to 
secure buy-in and commitment from other companies’ management teams. 
Address these issues by stressing systems and initiatives you’re designing to 
achieve greater sustainability collaboration and lining out how you’re helping 
your suppliers develop a culture of sustainability. For example, invite their 
employees to participate in a sustainability training you’re sponsoring at your 
facility. As your employees mingle with your suppliers’ employees and listen to 
the same presentation on greening your supply chain, they’ll begin to establish 
a common ground and form a partnership geared toward attaining green goals.
Social goals are also often hard to meet because of a series of factors, includ-
ing the complexity inherent in changing human values and behaviors and 
the difficulty in conducting multiple initiatives simultaneously. Continue to 
stress your new programs and talk about how many employees have joined

 Chapter 16: Creating Sustainability Reports That Wow Stakeholders
the walk-at-lunch group or taken advantage of the dollar-for-dollar match to 
purchase a commuter bike. Keep conducting surveys so you can report in on 
new employee behaviors and, of course, log progress on the actual targets 
(such as reduced absenteeism and increased productivity).
Going the extra mile with a green audit 
or an assurance
As more publicly traded companies (over half 
the Standard & Poor’s 500 so far) issue sustain-
ability reports, stakeholder pressure for third-
party report verification will grow. Standards will 
likely develop at a rapid pace, but for right now, 
companies are relatively on their own for ensur-
ing the credibility of their sustainability reports. 
If pursuing third-party verification of your report 
is something you’re interested in, you can either 
go for a green audit or an assurance.
The word audit strikes fear in the heart of 
anyone who pays taxes, but in the sustainabil-
ity world, it’s not anything to be afraid of. Audits 
involve a third party assessing the validity, 
reliability, and relevance of information that’s 
being provided. The outcome of an audit is to 
express an opinion on the information as well 
as the internal controls in place in the company. 
The scope of a formal sustainability audit can 
vary, depending on what you feel your company 
needs to address. You can hire outside accoun-
tants to
 ✓ Ensure the integrity of data-collection pro-
cesses and systems
 ✓ Address the quality and reliability of key 
performance indicators (KPIs)
 ✓ Conduct a full audit of your report to see 
whether it conforms to the Global Reporting 
Initiative’s (GRI) standards, which are 
widely acknowledged as a comprehensive 
framework for sustainability reporting
Expect a formal sustainability audit to include a 
thorough review of the sustainability-reporting 
process, including an analysis of benchmarks, 
KPIs, and targets. When the audit is complete, 
you receive a letter outlining a series of rec-
ommendations, internal control improvement 
suggestions, and policies and procedures that 
you can institute to strengthen your company’s 
sustainability effort in the upcoming year.
Because sustainability reporting is such a 
new field and isn’t yet required in the U.S. and 
Canada, traditional auditors (found in account-
ing firms) have yet to significantly develop sus-
tainability auditing services in North America. 
Realistically, however, most small or mid-sized 
companies aren’t able to commit resources to 
a formal audit; therefore, they rely on informal 
approaches such as external stakeholder inter-
views to provide a sense of authenticity, called 
assurance, to their reports.
Assurance is a term used to express the result 
of an audit, but the two terms are used inter-
changeably to identify a third party’s stamp of 
approval. External assurance is designed to 
complement the GRI’s sustainability-report-
ing framework. It’s an open-source standard 
that encourages input from all parties in its 
development. External assurance can also be 
expressed in the form of advisory panels made 
up of stakeholders (who can play an important 
role in the assurance process because they’re 
third parties who are vested in the process and 
the credibility of the information).

332
Part IV: Measuring and Reporting Results 
Although financial statements have a formal 
engagement and assurance process, sustain-
ability reporting requires the use of many kinds 
of professionals, such as scientists, sociolo-
gists, organizational behavioralists, and engi-
neers. The qualifications for the different kinds 
of people involved in the external assurance of 
your sustainability report are highly dependent 
on your industry sector.
Interview stakeholders to solicit their responses 
in order to draft reports. Specifically, ask them 
whether all relevant issues are covered to their 
satisfaction and presented in a balanced, unbi-
ased way. Publish highlights of the interviews. 
This is an informal yet authentic way of offering 
an independent assessment of your report’s 
quality and can be very helpful in ensuring its 
credibility.
Only one of the Big Four CPA firms (Deloitte 
Touche Tohmatsu, KPMG, Pricewaterhouse
Coopers, and Ernst & Young) offers assurance 
services for sustainability reports in the U.S.

AccountAbility, a UK-based standard-set-
ting group, is one of the first organizations 
to publish formal assurance standards, 
known as the AA1000 Assurance Standard. 
CorporateRegister.com maintains an 
electronic directory of sustainability reports 
that have been tested against this standard; 
it’s worth checking out to glean what you can 
from other folks’ sustainability reports. More 
than 150 companies use or refer to the AA1000 
Assurance Standard in their reporting, so you 
have plenty of opportunities for inspiration.

of the visionaries, authors, CEOs, financiers, and 
entrepreneurs who make up my list of the (more than) ten 
socially responsible giants of the sustainable business 
world. And because you’re bound to encounter myths 
about sustainability as you strive to move your company

ten most common myths about climate change, sustain-
ability, and business — along with credible ways to refute 
these claims.

Chapter 17
More than Ten Green 
Business Visionaries and 
Their Success Stories
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the contributions of some of the most influential green business leaders
▶ Seeing how the written ideas of green thinkers have affected the green business movement
A
ll great paradigm shifts throughout history have their heroes, and the 
Green Revolution is no different. Its heroes are the men and women 
with overarching visions for their businesses, fields of study, and society as 
a whole. These people understand the complexity and interdependencies of 
the challenges facing commerce today. Their mindset is such that they easily 
move past the traditional short-term, profit-driven mentality and envision 
how sustainability can create competitive advantage, new revenue streams, 
and innovative design capacity — all while recognizing the Earth’s limits.
Most of these heroes were considered mavericks in their time, driving 
through green agendas before anyone really had a concept of what that 
meant. And yet, without exception, these people engendered fiercely loyal 
followers in their employees, colleagues, and stakeholders. In this chapter, I 
share (in alphabetical order) the stories of some of these early green giants. I 
hope that they may serve as inspiration for you, as they have for me, on your 
path to creating an economically, environmentally, and socially just business.
Ray Anderson, CEO, Interface, Inc.
In 1994, Canadian businessman Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface, Inc. (the 
world’s largest commercial carpeting manufacturer), read Paul Hawken’s The 
Ecology of Commerce. This book presents not only the historical scope of 
environmental destruction by industry but it also acknowledges the power 
of business to propel change and grow sustainably. Reading it brought about 

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Anderson’s self-proclaimed epiphany, and from that point forward, he was 
driven to reduce the company’s operational impact, create ecoinnovative 
products, and involve all the company’s stakeholders in his efforts.
Anderson’s guidance has since lead Interface to the forefront of meeting 
the sustainability challenge. A firm believer in industrial ecology and closed-
loop manufacturing (zero-waste production methods based on the constant 
recycling of materials), Anderson has spearheaded a 33-percent reduction 
in Interface’s organizational waste over the last decade. His strong commit-
ment to eliminating petroleum from the company’s product line has sparked 
a firestorm of creativity in recyclable materials, including the creation of 
Entropy — a carpet inspired by the asymmetrical patterns found in nature. 
Developed with help from Janine Benyus, an expert in biomimicry (described 
later in this chapter), this green product has become Interface’s top-selling 
carpet line, representing about 40 percent of its overall carpet tile sales.
One of the basic precepts of natural capitalism (which I fully explain in 
Chapter 3) is to move toward a service and flow economy and away from 
a product-based economy (see Chapter 6 for more on these two economic 
models), and Interface is a front runner in implementing this idea. It leases 
commercial floor coverings (as opposed to making an outright sale) and 
installs carpet squares instead of laying huge quantities of carpet. This busi-
ness model allows for replacing commercial carpeting tiles in heavy-traffic 
areas without having to pull up perfectly good carpet.
One thing’s certain: With Interface’s goal of complete sustainability by 2020, 
this company and its green leader are worth watching.
Joan Bavaria, CEO, Trillium 
Asset Management
A former TIME Magazine Hero for the Planet, Joan Bavaria (founder and CEO 
of Trillium Asset Management) is to socially responsible investing (SRI) what 
Sir Isaac Newton was to physics — minus the apple. Other people dabbled 
around the perimeter of ecofinancial markets, but no one created the alli-
ances, energy, and fund families that went mainstream like Bavaria.
Bavaria’s company is the United States’ oldest independent SRI firm. 
Managing more than $1 billion in assets, Trillium has been instrumental in 
effecting corporate change through shareholder resolutions that target social 
and environmental improvements. It also donates 5 percent of its profits to 
philanthropic endeavors.

337
 Chapter 17: More than Ten Green Business Visionaries
In addition to running the employee-owned Trillium, Bavaria founded two 
powerful nonprofit players in the SRI field:
 
✓ Social Investment Forum: This organization is a national association with 
more than 500 members (including foundations, financial advisors, and 
portfolio managers) that furthers research on and publication about SRI.
 
✓ Coalition of Environmentally Responsible Economies: CERES is the 
organization responsible for publishing the CERES Principles, a set of 
standards for corporate environmental management. Transnational 
companies (including General Motors and Bank of America) endorse 
these principles, which have served as the basis for many companies’ 
desires to engage in sustainability reporting, transparency, and corpo-
rate social responsibility.
As Trillium continues to grow in asset base, its influence on the capital mar-
kets will grow commensurately. But even more profound than dollars of 
assets managed is the foundation that Trillium provided for the hundreds 
of firms and funds now dedicated to the green financial market. It’d be hard 
to imagine how far down the ecopath U.S. capital markets would be without 
Bavaria’s visionary leadership.
Janine Benyus, Scientist 
and Author, Biomimicry
Janine Benyus, an avowed naturalist and a scientist by training, coined the 
term biomimicry in 1997. Biomimicry (from bios meaning life and mimesi 
meaning imitate) is now a widely used term in product design labs and inter-
national boardrooms alike. Benyus’s book of the same name counsels engi-
neers and designers to look to nature’s nearly four billion years of experience 
for the answers to their most challenging design problems.
With clients like Nike, Hewlett Packard, and the British government, Benyus is 
widely sought after as both a speaker and a consultant to introduce product 
engineers to nature-inspired designs. (See Chapter 7 for a closer look at some 
of the amazing products inspired by Benyus’s biomimicry.) In her spare time, 
Benyus founded The Biomimicry Institute, a nonprofit, open-source organiza-
tion that links people from all corners of the globe who are working on sus-
tainable technologies. She was honored as one of TIME International’s Heroes 
of the Environment in 2007 — joining the ranks of past heroes Al Gore, Robert 
Redford, and Amory Lovins — for her innovative work in biomimicry.

Sir John Browne, Former CEO, 
British Petroleum
Oil drilling, refining, and chemical production are environmentally dangerous 
industries that are susceptible to ecoregulations and heavily peppered with 
climate change naysayers. But when Sir John Browne announced, one year 
after becoming CEO, that British Petroleum (BP) was leaving the American oil 
industry’s lobby group because it acknowledged the reality of global climate 
change and intended to do something about it by setting greenhouse gas 
emission reduction targets, the industry took a giant green step forward.
In 2000, Browne spearheaded a $200 million rebranding campaign at BP, 
focusing future strategies around renewable energy development and chang-
ing the behemoth’s name to Beyond Petroleum. Although BP isn’t without 
its share of controversy, it has earned a “best of class” rating among socially 
responsible investment funds.
Browne has since stepped down from his role at BP, but he’ll forever be 
known as a leading petrochemical executive who stopped questioning cli-
mate change science and started positioning his company for competitive 
advantage in solar, wind, and alternative fuels. With $250 billion in annual 
sales, the impact BP will have on revolutionizing energy at the global scale 
can only be imagined.
Yvon Chouinard, Founder, 
Patagonia, Inc.
In the 1960s, Yvon Chouinard turned a passion for rock climbing into a fledging 
company called Chouinard Equipment, which used its catalogue to stress the 
importance of clean climbing (leaving no scar on the rock). Chouinard under-
stood early on that customer education was crucial to sustained behavioral 
change.
Patagonia — a company now known worldwide for its innovation, social and 
environmental friendliness, and the superb quality of its outdoor gear — 
evolved after the sale of Chouinard Equipment. As Chouinard traveled inter-
nationally to surf, fish, ice climb, and kayak, the rapidity with which environ-
mental and native community destruction was occurring across the globe 
prompted him to analyze how Patagonia could reduce its impact.
During the 1990s, Chouinard led the company in aligning business practices 
with values by addressing how to mitigate the environmental harm it was 
causing. Patagonia’s basic values, including the idea of striving to do no 

339
 Chapter 17: More than Ten Green Business Visionaries
harm, emerged as a result. Patagonia has since developed core philosophies 
in product design, production, distribution, HR, finance, and management to 
guide business conduct in each area. One of the outcomes was that Patagonia 
became the first company to make catalogues from recycled paper.
Chouinard’s enduring legend also includes cofounding 1% For The Planet, 
an affiliation of businesses that pledges to contribute at least one percent 
of annual revenues to grassroots environmental organizations. Building an 
amazingly profitable business that taxes itself and works diligently to operate 
in conjunction with nature and indigenous communities is quite an inspira-
tion. Perhaps that’s why Chouinard’s brainchild receives 3,000 applications 
on average for just one job opening. Not bad results for a small climbing com-
pany that aspired to conduct business in a sustainable way, huh?
Paul Hawken, Author, 
The Ecology of Commerce
Paul Hawken, although influential in many arenas, has had the most impact 
on sustainable development as an author. His first book, The Ecology of 
Commerce, was not only used extensively in business schools but also widely 
touted as the authority on establishing environmental policy as it applies to 
commerce. It introduced the concept of comprehensive outcome — the idea 
that in order to truly gauge the impact of a business transaction, the decision-
maker must analyze all affected parties by using systems-based thinking. This 
idea was a significant break with the simplistic notion that the driving goal of 
business is to maximize shareholder wealth, and it contributed significantly to 
the development of full-cost accounting, the practice of accumulating all costs 
(social, environmental, and economic) in the cost basis of a product. For exam-
ple, anything made with petroleum would need to take into account the costs 
of climate change, groundwater remediation, and impact on biodiversity.
Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, which he coau-
thored with Hunter Lovins and Amory Lovins, established consideration of 
the Earth’s limits and carrying capacity as a key constraint in business deci-
sion-making. Hawken’s 2007 book, Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement 
in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming, identifies the 
union of the social and environmental movements as the most impactful 
social movement ever.
Aside from writing, Hawken travels and speaks widely on behalf of Wiser 
Earth, an organization he recently founded that connects the millions of orga-
nizations working on environmental and social issues. He has been a schol-
arly, guiding voice for many students, entrepreneurs, and businesspeople 
over the years, and he is widely considered one of the pivotal influences in 
the sustainability movement.

Jeffrey Hollender, President, 
Seventh Generation
Winner of the 2008 Fast Company/Monitor Group Social Capitalist Award for 
“using the tools of business to solve the world’s most pressing problems,” 
Jeffrey Hollender is President and Chief Inspired Protagonist of Seventh 
Generation. Commanding about 25 percent of the natural household prod-
ucts and cleaners’ $150 million annual market, Seventh Generation has made 
inroads with such giants as Safeway, Wal-Mart, and Kroger. Hollender is also 
an author and founder of the Household Toxins Institute, which conducts 
research on the impact of household chemicals on human health.
Hollender’s Burlington, Vermont–based company incorporates sustainability 
at every turn. Long before anyone mainstream thought of unbleached paper 
towels or natural dishwashing soap, Hollender and cofounder Alan Newman 
tallied sales of $1 million from their first year in business. The company 
has certainly had its ups and downs, but what sets Hollender and Seventh 
Generation apart is leadership’s firm commitment to sustainability reporting 
and full transparency and its exceptional efforts to educate suppliers, con-
sumers, and employees about the benefits of sustainable products and prac-
tices. Hollender has dared to enter his products into the mainstream market 
and has the market share and profits to show for it.
Jeffrey Immelt, CEO, General Electric
Chairman of the Board and CEO of General Electric (GE), Jeffrey Immelt is one 
of the founders of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership. In this alliance, he and 
his cohorts have pressured the federal government to control greenhouse 
gases through policy and regulation. Suffice it to say these actions haven’t 
won him favor in some industry circles.
Undaunted, Immelt launched GE’s Ecoimagination campaign, which famously 
declared that “Green is green” in May 2005. He has also actively led GE in pur-
suit of a sustainable agenda that embraces four measurable action items, all 
anticipated to occur between 2004 and 2010:
 
✓ Doubled investment in clean tech R&D between 2004 and 2010, peaking 
at $1.5 billion annually
 
✓ Increased introduction of products and services that exhibit marked 
environmental performance through the Ecoimagination line of products
 
✓ Significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through usage of prod-
ucts both in consumers’ hands and in company facilities and operations
 
✓ Complete and total transparency to the public about how the campaign 
is quantitatively meeting its proclaimed goals

341
 Chapter 17: More than Ten Green Business Visionaries
Not only has Immelt repositioned GE to be a leader in climate change solu-
tions (including solar power, water-purification systems, and a plethora of 
energy-efficient jet and locomotive initiatives) but he has also inspired many 
other high-profile business leaders to manage in an environmentally and 
socially responsible way.
Amory Lovins, Coauthor, 
Natural Capitalism
Amory Lovins is that rare blend of visionary and realist — and one who has 
stayed true to the course he set out for himself more than 40 years ago. By 
the 1970s, he was already writing, talking, and testifying about the need for 
new North American energy policies. Combining an education in physics, 
ardent environmentalism, and a knack for business, Lovins created a buzz as 
a consultant for major international firms. Of the many books he has coau-
thored, Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution is arguably 
the most influential for its wide application as a sustainability framework for 
businesses of all shapes and sizes. (For more info on natural capitalism and 
how it’s used as a working business framework, flip to Chapter 3.)
In the 1990s, Lovins cofounded the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a not-for-
profit energy consultancy firm. RMI’s headquarters is located in a south-facing 
compound that’s so energy efficient an adequate interior temperature is main-
tained from sunlight alone — even with Colorado’s subzero winter tempera-
tures. In fact, the building houses semitropical and tropical indoor plants!
Lovins continues to have a big impact on the world’s largest corporations 
and governments by guiding such giants as Wal-Mart, Motorola, and the 
Australian and Canadian governments in their quests for sustainability.
William McDonough & Michael 
Braungart, Authors, Cradle to Cradle
When architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart pub-
lished their book, Cradle to Cradle, in 2002, the fact that their very basic 
premise hadn’t been explored previously was simply astounding. The theory? 
That by emulating the natural world, all outputs should become inputs for 
another process, thereby completely eliminating the concept of waste.
According to this business model, green design concepts should be applied 
universally — whether you’re consulting with a developer on the construc-
tion of a small subdivision or reconfiguring an auto manufacturer’s production 

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
facility. Pollution and toxins are thus simply and completely eliminated, and 
any waste byproducts are deliberately introduced as raw materials for another 
process or product.
Guided by the idea that nothing goes to waste, McDonough and Braungart 
recommend that all design incorporate thoughtfulness about what happens 
to an item at the end of its useful life. They urge manufacturers to create 
products that can be easily disassembled so biological nutrients can return 
to the soil for natural decomposition. They also stress that technical nutrients, 
or noncompostable items, should be separated and used in an endless cycle 
of production. Using nature as a model for ecologically sound design has 
driven this team’s work with Nike, Herman Miller, Ford, and Oberlin College, 
just to name a few of the well-known organizations they counsel.
Muhammad Yunus, Nobel Laureate 
and Founder, The Grameen Bank
Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, Muhammad Yunus (also known as 
the Banker to the Poor) has been instrumental in fueling sustainable eco-
nomic development in the Third World. He realized early on that lack of 
access to capital was a key impediment to eradicating poverty. For example, 
in his native Bangladesh, most of the rural poor could only source funds to 
start a small business from predatory street lenders. So Yunus decided to use 
his own money to grant the first microloans to basket weavers, giving birth to 
the Grameen Bank in the process.
Instead of following the western model of signing notes and offering collateral — 
a system that’s irrelevant for many developing nations due to their high levels 
of poverty and illiteracy — the Grameen Bank model asks borrowers to have 
community members vouch for their character and offer a verbal commitment 
to repay the loan. Grameen Bank sports a repayment rate any commercial 
lender would be proud of, and it has lent out more than $7 billion and been 
profitable in all but three years since its inception in 1983. Today, the bank dis-
burses 97 percent of its funds to women.
Not only has Yunus’s Grameen Bank helped hundreds of thousands of people 
out of poverty and given them dignity to earn their own living but it has 
also provided a microfinance model that stresses cultural relevance, female 
empowerment, and community development — a model that’s being repli-
cated in more than 100 countries worldwide.

Chapter 18
Countering Ten Myths 
about Going Green
In This Chapter
▶ Capitalizing on the business case for sustainability
▶ Illustrating how even small changes can have a big impact
N
o matter how far down the green path you may be, you’re sure to 
encounter skepticism and maybe even scorn from colleagues, bosses, 
and business partners. Such negative reaction is usually fueled by concerns 
about cost and an increased workload.
Following are ten of the most common myths about greening a commercial 
endeavor. You may hear them on occasion, or your mind may even wander 
toward these thoughts when you’re feeling less than inspired. Believe me, I 
know that some days it seems much easier to talk about all the reasons your 
business can’t go green than to get moving and implement actions. However, 
I’m here to dispel these nasty rumors so you can move forward without a 
doubt that striving for sustainability is indeed worthwhile.
The Costs Outweigh the Profits
The idea that the costs of greening your business outweigh any potential 
profits is a very general argument that’s actually part myth and part fact. 
Some projects, such as those designed to reduce waste production, energy 
usage, excessive materials use, or water usage, can actually save your com-
pany money. (These projects are referred to as the low-hanging fruit of green 
business practices.) The key is to focus on what can be done quickly and 
easily now — with low cost and big impact! (For a list of easy ways to green 
your daily office practices, consult Chapter 6.)
Other projects, specifically longer-range efforts, like installing a ground 
source heat pump, retrofitting all of your lighting ballasts, or even building a 
green facility, clearly have price tags associated with them. For these 

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
projects, make sure to convey the concept that as savings accrue from pick-
ing the low-hanging fruit, the company will have seed capital to invest in 
other green projects that may require start-up funding. Emphasize the win-
win nature of using short-term savings to fund long-term projects. After all, 
long-term triple-bottom-line benefits accrue from a portfolio of both short- 
and long-term projects.
 
Obviously, if you walk into your CEO’s office with a blanket statement like, 
“Let’s go green,” you probably won’t get the buy-in you want. Instead, try to 
convince him or her to look at an alternative business paradigm by talking 
the language. Triple-bottom-line thinking (giving equal consideration to people, 
planet, and profit) is a new model for many executives and managers. The way 
to work them into it is by starting with what they understand: the profit part 
of the equation. So get proficient with the business case outlined in Chapter 
1 and relate these five compelling reasons as to why your boss should green 
your company:
 
✓ Increased revenues through the development of new products to meet 
evolving green consumers’ needs
 
✓ Decreased expenses through the savings inherent in cutting water 
usage, waste output, and energy usage
 
✓ Increased access to business capital by tapping into the new pools of 
money aimed at funding green businesses
 
✓ Good positioning to meet future challenges, particularly those pertain-
ing to energy volatility, so as to decrease future risk
 
✓ Happier and more productive employees working in a socially just and 
healthy environment
Going Green Requires Extensive 
Ecoknowledge
With words such as eco, sustainable, and green bombarding people day in and 
day out in the mass media, it’s hard not to believe that going green means 
speaking an entirely different language and acquiring a vast, new knowledge 
base. However, the basic concepts of going green in the business world 
are rather easy to understand because they relate to subjects any business 
owner already knows all about: increasing revenues, decreasing expenses, 
meeting customers’ needs, and establishing a game plan for the future.
 
When faced with this myth, respond with a series of irrefutable snippets that 
are easy to grasp, painless to remember, and simple to repeat. The following 
few sum up all you need to know about greening business practices in order 
to start convincing the naysayers:

345
 Chapter 18: Countering Ten Myths about Going Green
 
✓ Green business is about focusing on the triple bottom line, which con-
sists of people, planet, and profit, rather than looking solely at short-
term profit. Thinking in these terms positions your company to cope 
with all the changes that are occurring in the business world.
 
✓ Reducing water usage, waste production, energy usage, and excessive 
materials use are all big parts of going green that save you money, both 
in the short and long term.
 
✓ Becoming sustainable is a journey, not a destination, so don’t worry if 
you don’t understand it all now. Your company will evolve as you make 
the transition.
Our Employees Are Too Busy to 
Implement Green Initiatives
The myth of employees who are too swamped to help green their companies 
isn’t entirely far from the truth. If you take a snapshot of most companies 
now compared to ten years ago, you find that fewer people are doing more 
work for pay that hasn’t kept pace with inflation. So what incentive is there 
for employees to participate in green team meetings or sort departmental 
recycling on top of their daily tasks? (Here’s a hint: Preaching about how 
going green is the right thing to do isn’t the answer!)
To mitigate employee resistance and incorporate greening efforts easily, 
make changes as simple as possible to implement, particularly in the intro-
ductory phase of greening your business. For example, if your recycling plan 
makes it easier to toss items in a recycling bin rather than throw them in the 
garbage, you’ll have nearly full staff buy-in. Likewise, if you show employees 
how they can save $50 per week by carpooling, you’ll pique their interest.
 
Avoid starting with projects or programs that add a ton of tasks to your staff 
members’ to-do lists. On Day One, you must make change easy or you’ll just 
be wasting everyone’s time. As your employees’ ecoconscious spirits awaken 
through small start-up initiatives, then you can play with ideas that require 
asking something of them.
My Business Is Too Small to Matter
I often hear businesspeople spout the myth that their companies are too 
small to effect powerful green change. Although I understand it’s hard to 
imagine how setting 1/2-inch margins to save office paper will have any impact 
on global issues such as social inequality and climate change, the truth is 

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
that any step toward sustainability (no matter how small) makes a difference. 
If all companies make small strides, the cumulative impact will be bigger than 
if they didn’t start at all.
Many of the small beginner initiatives (like altering company printing practices 
to save paper or turning off lights in unused spaces) actually save companies 
money. Combine that savings with the lower expenses, higher profits, better 
job security, and superior positioning for the future that comes from greening 
a business, and even the smallest company can see how embracing sustainabil-
ity can have an impact on both the environment and the corporate coffers.
Why Start Now? The Earth 
Is Already Doomed
It seems these days that lots of people have gone from a big collective yawn 
on the doom-and-gloom front to the “We’re dust, why even bother?” state 
of mind. Although the changes in nature (described in Chapter 2) are worth 
being concerned about, staying focused on the positive is important. The 
exciting part of the story is how much opportunity exists for businesses to 
meet the challenges of the 21st century, craft solutions to some of the world’s 
most pressing problems, and enjoy competitive advantages while doing so.
 
The next time you encounter some corporate honcho spouting off this myth, 
refer this person to the business case for sustainability (found in Chapter 1) 
so as to outline precisely how his or her business can cash in on the opportu-
nities inherent in going green — starting today.
This Climate Change Thing Will Pass
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of 160 scientists 
from all over the world, has been studying the issue of climate change for 
20 years. Its increasingly solid conclusion? The planet is warming at a rate 
that most species can’t adapt to, and there’s a 90 percent likelihood that this 
warming is caused by human activities. However, some people you encoun-
ter will insist that human-accelerated climate change is just a passing phase. 
Chances are they’ll have their own scientific evidence too because there are 
small-scale studies out there that show contrary results.

347
 Chapter 18: Countering Ten Myths about Going Green
 
Unless you’re a climatologist, forget debating the science. That’s a no-win situ-
ation. Instead, focus on the fact that climate change, whether human acceler-
ated or not, poses many challenges and opportunities for business moving 
forward. Speculating, even if just for a moment, as to what one’s business will 
look like if the price of oil rises to $250 a barrel or if carbon emissions are 
capped is well worth any manager’s time. Always redirect conversation about 
this myth toward scenario analysis and away from science.
Not to Worry — Technology 
Will Provide the Answers!
To assert that technology is the stand-alone answer to the tests facing busi-
ness today (such as how to cope with climate change, peak oil, and trade 
deficits) is an easy out. Yes, investing in alternative transportation and 
fuels, sustainable agriculture, and green construction and building materi-
als is essential to crafting a sustainable future. However, these technological 
investments aren’t instead of conserving energy and water.
 
Technological advancements don’t replace the need to reduce waste, use 
recycled materials, close the global equity gap, and treat foreign employees 
with dignity. All these different sustainability components work together. 
Minimizing your business’s impact on nature’s systems, via technology or not, 
is always important.
Our Shareholders Just Want 
Short-Term Results
Because of the commercial and cultural emphasis on immediate gratification, 
especially when it comes to short-term financial results, you may find people 
claiming that any initiatives requiring long-term thinking just won’t fly with the 
company’s shareholders. That’s simply not true. Just invite a calculation of 
total returns over the lifetime of a green project versus its immediate impact.
If you point out that when current energy, carbon, or waste costs are fac-
tored in, there’s a high likelihood of much bigger costs to deal with in the 
future, you’ll have these folks’ attention. (After all, whether your company 
succeeds or fails financially in the long run has an impact on them, too.) That 
societal need for immediate gratification will go right out the window — or at 
least to the back of people’s minds for the time being.

348
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The Whole Green Scene Is a 
Ploy by Whiny Ecoliberals
The false idea that the green movement is a stunt being pulled by left-
wingers is a result of mass media’s passion for segregating and categorizing 
the greater population to create controversy. After all, without controversy, 
there are no stories. The move toward greening business, however, can’t 
truly be politicized with any credibility. How can increasing profits while 
lessening corporate impact on the Earth and contributing to community 
development possibly be political in nature?
Don’t get caught up in this myth. Disarm any cynic who tries to defend it with 
a few choice facts that illustrate how sustainable businesses are outperforming 
their counterparts on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, or 
how major multibillion-dollar corporations (think BP, Nike, Hewlett Packard, 
and GE) have fully embraced a green agenda to position their companies for 
the 21st century by being the first to enter and capture green niche markets.
 
Above all, stay positive and focused on the reality of the business case for sus-
tainability. Dispute is difficult if you stay out of the political arena and remain 
centered on business.
This Problem Isn’t Ours to Solve
This myth belongs to a particular demographic group that questions why 
businesses should be forced to figure out their own sustainability strategies 
when government policies have been so remiss over the years in encourag-
ing sustainable behavior. For example, it doesn’t seem fair to many business 
owners why they should be left to absorb increased energy costs when gov-
ernment has passed on many opportunities to invest in alternatives.
This group thinks the nation’s elected representatives need to lead the way 
in going green by enacting massive programs to encourage green building, 
sustainable product design, and research and development for renewable 
energy. It also believes the government should mandate prohibitive taxes on 
plastic bags, waste, and fossil fuel emissions.
In reality, the challenges and opportunities inherent in instituting green change 
on a nationwide scale are so great that it will take power, persuasion, policy, 
and behavior change on the part of everyone involved. To truly effect change 
that will enable a sustainable future, nonprofits; federal, state, and municipal 
governments; businesses; and individuals all need to contribute their resources 
and wisdom to that end. (To see how you and your business can start helping 
set policy that applies to the future of business overall, see Chapter 5.)
