About the Authors
Edward C. Baig writes the weekly Personal Technology column in USA
TODAY and is co-host of the weekly USA TODAY’s Talking Tech podcast. He is
also the author of Macs For Dummies, 9th Edition, for Wiley Publishing. Before
joining USA TODAY as a columnist in 1999, Ed spent six years at Business
Week, where he wrote and edited stories about consumer tech, personal
ﬁnance, collectibles, and travel, among other topics. He received the Medill
School of Journalism 1999 Financial Writers and Editors Award for contribu-
tions to the “Business Week Investor Guide to Online Investing.” That fol-
lowed a three-year stint at U.S. News & World Report, where Ed was the lead
tech writer for the News You Can Use section but also dabbled in other sub-
jects. He recalls fondly putting together features on baseball card investing,
karaoke machines, and the odd things people collect, including Pez dis-
pensers, vintage radios, and magic memorabilia.
Ed began his journalist career at Fortune magazine, gaining the best basic
training imaginable during his early years as a fact checker. Through the
dozen years he worked at the magazine, Ed covered leisure-time industries,
penned features on the lucrative dating market and the effect of religion on
corporate managers, and also started up Fortune’s Products to Watch
column.


Bob LeVitus, often referred to as “Dr. Mac,” has written or co-written 50 pop-
ular computer books, including Dr. Mac: The OS X Files and Mac OS X Leopard
For Dummies for Wiley Publishing; Stupid Mac Tricks and Dr. Macintosh for
Addison-Wesley; and The Little iTunes Book, 3rd Edition and The Little iDVD
Book, 2nd Edition for Peachpit Press. His books have sold more than a million
copies worldwide.  Bob has penned the popular Dr. Mac column for the
Houston Chronicle for the past ten years and has been published in dozens of
computer magazines over the past ﬁfteen years. His achievements have been
documented in major media around the world. (Yes, that was Bob juggling a
keyboard in USA Today a few years back!) 
Bob is considered one of the world’s leading authorities on Mac OS. From
1989 to 1997, he was a contributing editor and columnist for MacUser maga-
zine, writing the Help Folder, Beating the System, Personal Best, and Game
Room columns at various times. In his copious spare time, Bob heads up a
team of expert technical consultants who do nothing but provide technical
help and training to Mac users via telephone, e-mail, and Internet-enabled
remote control software, which allows them to see and control your Mac no
matter where in the world you may be. If you’re having problems with your
Mac, you ought to give them a try. You’ll ﬁnd them at www.boblevitus.com

Dedications
I dedicate this book to my beautiful wife, Janie, for making me a better person
every day I am with her. And to my incredible kids: my adorable little girl,
Sydney (one of her ﬁrst words was “iPod”), my infant son, Samuel (who is all
smiles from the moment he wakes up in the morning), and, of course, my
“canine” son, Eddie. I am madly in love with you all.
—Ed Baig
This book is dedicated to my wife, Lisa, who taught me almost everything I
know about almost everything except computers. And to my children, Allison
and Jacob, who love their Macs almost as much as I love them (my kids, not
my Macs).
—Bob LeVitus

iPhone For Dummies 

Introduction
P
recious few products ever come close to generating the kind of buzz
seen with the iPhone. Its messianic arrival received front-page treatment
in newspapers and top billing on network and cable TV shows. People lined
up days in advance just to ensure landing one of the first units. Years from
now, people will insist, “I was one of them.”
But we trust you didn’t pick up this book to read yet another account about
how the iPhone launch was an epochal event. We trust you did buy the book
to find out how to get the very most out of your remarkable new device.
Our goal is to deliver that information in a light and breezy fashion. We
expect you to have fun using your iPhone. We equally hope you will have fun
spending time with us.
About This Book
Let’s get one thing out of the way right from the get-go. We think you’re pretty
darn smart for buying a For Dummies book. That says to us you have the con-
fidence and intelligence to know what you don’t know. The Dummies fran-
chise is built around the core notion that all of us feel insecure about certain
topics when tackling them for the first time, especially when those topics
have to do with technology.
As with most products coming out of Apple, the iPhone is beautifully
designed and intuitive to use. And though our editors may not want us to
reveal this dirty little secret (especially on the first page, for goodness sakes),
the truth is you’ll get pretty far just by exploring the iPhone’s many functions
and features on your own, without the help of this or any other book.
Okay, now that we spilled the beans, let’s tell you why you shouldn’t run back
to the bookstore and request a refund. This book is chock full of useful tips,
advice, and other nuggets that should make your iPhone experience all the
more pleasurable. So keep this book nearby and consult it often.
Conventions Used in This Book
So let’s tell you how we go about our business. iPhone For Dummies makes
generous use of numbered and bulleted lists and pictures. Web addresses are
shown in a special monofont typeface, like this. 

2
iPhone For Dummies 
We’ve also included a few sidebars with information that is not required read-
ing (not that any of the book is) but that we hope will provide a richer under-
standing of certain subjects. Overall, we aim to keep technical jargon to a
minimum, under the guiding principle that with rare exceptions you need not
know what any of it really means.
How This Book Is Organized
Here’s something we imagine you’ve never heard before: Most books have a
beginning, middle, and end, and you’ll do well by adhering to that linear
structure. Unless you’re one of those knuckleheads out to ruin it for the rest
of us by revealing Harry Potter’s fate.
Fortunately, there is no ending to spoil in a For Dummies book. So while you
may well want to digest this book from start to finish — and we hope you 
do — we won’t penalize you for skipping ahead and jumping around. Having
said that, we organized iPhone For Dummies in an order that we think makes
the most sense, as follows.
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone
In the introductory chapters of Part I, you tour the iPhone inside and out,
find out how to activate the phone with Apple’s partner AT&T, and get hands-
on (or, more precisely, fingers-on) experience with the iPhone’s unique 
virtual multitouch display.
Part II: The Mobile iPhone
There’s a reason the iPhone has phone in its name. Part II is mostly about all
the ways you can make and receive calls on the device. But you’ll also dis-
cover how to exchange text messages and play with the Calendar, Clock, and
Calculator applications.
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone
Part III is where the fun truly begins. This is the iPhone as an iPod, meaning
music, videos, movies, pictures, and other diversions come to life.
Part IV: The Internet iPhone
Part IV covers the mobile Internet. You’ll master the Safari browser, e-mail,
maps, and more.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone
In Part V you find out how to apply your preferences through the iPhone’s
internal settings as well as discover where to go for troubleshooting assis-
tance if and when the iPhone starts misbehaving.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Otherwise known as the Dummies answer to David Letterman. The lists pre-
sented in Part VI steer you to terrific iPhone-related Web sites, provide handy
tips and shortcuts, and offer our own suggestions on how you’re newly
favored device might get even better.
Icons Used in This Book
Little round pictures (icons) appear in the left margins throughout this book.
Consider these icons miniature road signs, telling you a little something extra
about the topic at hand or really hammering a point home.
Here’s what the four different icons used in this book look like and mean.
These are the juicy morsels, shortcuts, and recommendations that might
make the task at hand faster or easier.
This tip emphasizes the stuff we think you ought to retain. You may even jot
down a note to yourself in the iPhone.
Put on your propeller beanie hat and pocket protector; this text includes the
truly geeky stuff. You can safely ignore this material, but if it weren’t interest-
ing or informative, we wouldn’t have bothered to write it.
You wouldn’t intentionally run a stop sign, would you? In the same fashion,
ignoring warnings may be hazardous to your iPhone and (by extension) your
wallet. There, you now know how these warning icons work, for you have just
received your very first warning!

iPhone For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
Why straight to Chapter 1, of course, (without passing Go).
In all seriousness, we wrote this book for you, so please let us know what you
think. If we screwed up, confused you, left something out, or heaven forbid
made you angry, drop us a note. And if we hit you with one pun too many, it
helps to know that as well.
Since writers are people too (believe it or not), we also encourage posi-
tive feedback if you think it is warranted. So kindly send e-mail to Ed at 
baigdummies@aol.com and to Bob at iPhoneLeVitus@boblevitus.com.
We’ll do our best to respond to reasonably polite e-mail in a timely fashion.
Most of all, we want to thank you for buying our book. Please enjoy it along
with your new iPhone.
Note: At the time we wrote this book, we covered the only iPhone model that
was available and the latest version of iTunes. Apple is likely to introduce a
new iPhone model or new version of iTunes between book editions. If you’ve
bought a new iPhone or your version of iTunes looks a little different, be sure
to check out the companion Web site (www.dummies.com/go/iphone1e) for
updates on the latest releases from Apple.

Part I
Getting to Know
Your iPhone

You have to crawl before you walk, so con-
sider this part basic training for crawling.
The three chapters that make up Part I serve as a
gentle introduction to your iPhone.
We start out nice and easy, with a big-picture
overview. In Chapter 1 we look at what’s in the box.
Then we examine just some of the cool things your
iPhone can do. We ﬁnish things off with a quick-
and-dirty tour of the hardware and the software.
Next, after you’re somewhat familiar with where
things are and what they do, we move right along
to a bunch of useful iPhone skills, such as turning
the darn thing on and off (which is very impor-
tant) and locking and unlocking your phone
(which is also very important). Chapter 2 ends
with useful tips and tricks to help you master
iPhone’s unique multitouch interface so you can
use it effectively and efﬁciently.
Then, in Chapter 3, we explore the process of 
synchronization and how to get data — contacts,
appointments, movies, songs, podcasts, and 
such — from your computer into your iPhone
quickly and painlessly.

In This Chapter

C
ongratulations. You’ve selected one of the most incredible handheld
devices we’ve ever seen — and one that is much more than just a great
wireless phone. Of course, the iPhone is one heck of a wireless telephone,
complete with a capable 2-megapixel digital camera. But it’s actually three
awesome handheld devices in one. In addition to being a killer cell phone, it’s
a gorgeous widescreen video iPod and the smallest, most powerful Internet
communications device yet.
In this chapter, we offer a gentle introduction to all three “products”
that make up your iPhone, plus overviews of its revolutionary
hardware and software features.
The Big Picture
The iPhone has many best-of-class features, but per-
haps its most unusual feature is the lack of a physi-
cal keyboard or stylus. Instead, it has a 31⁄2-inch
super-high-resolution touchscreen (160 pixels per
inch if you care about such things) that you operate
using a pointing device you’re already intimately famil-
iar with: namely, your finger.
And what a display it is. We venture that you’ve never seen a
more beautiful screen on a handheld device in your life.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Bob interjects:
I am rarely tongue-tied but I could barely form coherent sentences during my first
encounter with a real live iPhone at Macworld Expo last January. In fact, I had
to explain to the Apple executives conducting my briefing, VP of Worldwide iPod
Product Marketing Greg Joswiak and VP of Worldwide Mac Product Marketing
David Moody, that while I knew it was completely unprofessional for a journalist
to gush and drool, I just couldn’t help myself.
Another feature that knocked our socks off was the iPhone’s built-in sensors.
An accelerometer detects when you rotate the device from portrait to land-
scape mode and adjusts what’s on the display accordingly. A proximity
sensor detects when the iPhone gets near your face, so it can turn off the dis-
play to save power and prevent accidental touches by your cheek. And a light
sensor adjusts the display’s brightness based on the current ambient lighting
situation. Let’s see your Palm Treo or RIM Blackberry do that!
In this section we take a brief look at just some of the iPhone’s features,
broken down by product category.
What’s in the box
Somehow we think you’ve already opened the
handsome black box that the iPhone came in.
But if you didn’t, here’s what you can expect to
find inside:
 Stereo headset: Used for music videos and,
yes, phone calls. The headset contains a
built-in microphone for making yourself
heard during phone calls. More on the use
of this headset in Chapter 7.
 Dock (and dock connector–to–USB cable):
When the iPhone is not being used, slip it
into this handy little white home to charge it.
The dock connects to your PC or Macintosh
via USB through the aptly named dock 
connector–to–USB cable.
 USB power adapter: You can use the afore-
mentioned cable to plug the iPhone into a
standard power outlet.
 Some Apple logo decals: Of course.
 Cleaning cloth: Expect the iPhone to get
smudges on it. Use the cloth to wipe it clean.
We’d steer clear of Lemon Pledge.
 Finger Tips pamphlet: You’ll find handy tips
from Apple on using the new object of your
affection.
 Important Product Information Guide pam-
phlet: Well it must be important because it
says so right on the cover. You’ll find basic
safety warnings, a bunch of legalese, war-
ranty information, and info on how to dis-
pose of or recycle the iPhone. What! We’re
getting rid of it already? A few other pieces
of advice: Don’t drop the iPhone if you can
help it, keep the thing dry, and — as with all
cell phones — give full attention to the road
while driving.
 iPhone: You were starting to worry. Yes, the
iPhone itself is also in the box.

The iPhone as a phone and a digital camera
On the phone side, the iPhone synchronizes with the contacts and calendars
on your Mac or PC. It includes a full-featured QWERTY soft, or virtual, key-
board, which makes typing text easier than ever before — for some folks.
Granted, the virtual keyboard takes a bit of time to get used to. But we think
that many of you will eventually be whizzing along at a much faster pace than
you thought possible on a mobile keyboard of this type.
The 2-megapixel digital camera is accompanied by a sophisticated photo
management application, so taking and managing digital photos is a pleasure
rather than the nightmare it can be on other phones. Plus, you can automati-
cally synchronize iPhoto photos with the digital photo library on your Mac 
or PC.
Finally, one of our favorite phone accoutrements is visual voicemail. (Try
saying that three times fast.) This feature lets you see a list of voicemail mes-
sages and choose which ones to listen to or delete without being forced to
take in every message in your voice mailbox in sequential order. Now that’s
handy!
Those are merely a few of the iPhone’s excellent telephony features. Because
we still have many more chapters to go, we’ll put the phone coverage on hold
for now (pun intended).
The iPhone as an iPod
We agree with Steve Jobs on this one: The iPhone is a better iPod than any
that Apple has ever made. (Okay, we can quibble about wanting more stor-
age.) You can enjoy all of your existing iPod content — music, audiobooks,
audio and video podcasts, music videos, television shows, and movies — on
the iPhone’s gorgeous high-resolution color display, which is bigger, brighter,
and richer than any iPod display that’s come before it.
Bottom line: If you can get the content — be it video, audio, or whatever —
into iTunes on your Mac or PC, you can synchronize it and watch or listen to
it on your iPhone.
The iPhone as an Internet communications device
But wait — there’s more! Not only is the iPhone a great phone and a stellar
iPod, it’s also a full-featured Internet communications device with — we’re
about to drop a bit of industry jargon on you — a rich HTML e-mail client
that’s compatible with most POP and IMAP mail services. Also on board is a
world-class Web browser (Safari) that, unlike other phones, makes Web surf-
ing fun and easy.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Another cool Internet feature is Maps, a killer mapping application based on
Google Maps. You can view maps and satellite imagery and obtain driving
directions and traffic information regardless of where in the United States
you happen to be. You can also find businesses such as gas stations, restau-
rants, hospitals, and Apple stores with just a few taps.
You might also enjoy using Stocks, a built-in application that delivers near
real-time stock quotes and charts anytime and anyplace.
In other words, the Internet experience on an iPhone is far superior to the
Internet experience on any other handheld device.
Technical specifications
One last thing before we proceed. Here’s a list of everything you need before
you can actually use your iPhone:
 An iPhone (D'oh!)
 A wireless contract with AT&T (formerly Cingular)
 Internet access (required) or broadband Internet access (recommended)
Plus you need one of the following:
 A Mac with a USB 2.0 port; Mac OS X version 10.4.10 or later; and iTunes
7.3 or later
 A PC with a USB 2.0 port; Windows Vista Home Premium, Business,
Enterprise, or Ultimate Edition or Windows XP Home or Professional
with Service Pack 2 or later; and iTunes 7.3 or later
A Quick Tour Outside
The iPhone is a harmonious combination of hardware and software, so let’s
see just what it’s made of. In this section we take a brief look at what’s on the
outside. In the next section, we peek at the software.
On the top
On the top of your iPhone, you’ll find the headset jack, the SIM card tray, and
the Sleep/Wake button, as shown in Figure 1-1:

 The Sleep/Wake button: This button is used to lock or unlock your
iPhone and to turn your iPhone on or off. When your iPhone is locked,
you can still receive calls and text messages but nothing happens if you
touch its screen. When your iPhone is turned off, all incoming calls go
directly to voicemail.
 SIM card tray: The SIM card tray is where you remove or replace the SIM
card inside your iPhone.
A SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card is a removable smart card used
to identify mobile phones. It allows users to change phones by moving
the SIM card from one phone to another.
 Headset jack: The headset jack lets you plug in the included iPhone
headset, which looks a lot like white iPod earbuds. Unlike the iPod ear-
buds, however, the iPhone headset has a microphone so you can use it
to talk as well as to listen.
The headset jack is recessed, so most third-party earphones (such as
those made by Shure, Etymotic, and Future Sonics) don’t work with it.
Fortunately, for around $11 (at press time), you can buy an adapter from
companies such as Belkin that enables you to use just about any brand
or style of earphones you like with your iPhone.
Figure 1-1: The top side of the iPhone.
On the bottom
On the bottom of your iPhone, you’ll find the speaker, dock connector, and
microphone, as shown in Figure 1-2:
 Speaker: The speaker is used by the iPhone’s built-in speakerphone and
plays audio — music or video soundtracks — if no headset is plugged in.
It also plays the ringtone you hear when you receive a call.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Figure 1-2: The bottom side of the iPhone.
 Dock connector: The dock connector has two purposes. One, you can
use it to recharge your iPhone’s battery. Simply connect one end of the
included dock connector–to–USB cable to the dock connector and the
other end to the USB power adapter. Two, you can use the dock connec-
tor to recharge your iPhone’s battery as well as synchronize. Connect
one end of the same cable to the dock connector and the other end to a
USB port on your Mac or PC.
 Microphone: The microphone lets callers hear your voice when you’re
not using a headset.
On the front
On the front of your iPhone you’ll find the following (labeled in Figure 1-3):
 Ring/Silent switch: The Ring/Silent switch, which is on the left side of
your iPhone, lets you quickly switch between ring mode and silent
mode. When the switch is set to ring mode — the up position, with no
orange dot — your iPhone plays all sounds through the speaker on the
bottom. When the switch is set to silent mode — the down position,
with an orange dot visible on the switch — your iPhone doesn’t make a
sound when you receive a call or when an alert pops up on the screen.
The only exceptions are alarms you set in the built-in Clock application,
which do sound regardless of the Ring/Silent switch setting.
If your phone is set to ring mode and you want to silence it quickly, you
can press the Sleep/Wake button on the top side of the iPhone or press
one of the Volume buttons.
 Volume buttons: Two Volume buttons are just below of the Ring/Silent
switch. The upper button increases the volume, the lower one decreases
it. You use the Volume buttons to raise or lower the loudness of the
ringer, alerts, sound effects, songs, and movies. And during phone calls,
they adjust the loudness of the person you’re speaking with, regardless
of whether you’re listening through the receiver, the speakerphone, or a
headset.
Dock connector
Microphone
Speaker

 Receiver: The
receiver is the
speaker that the
iPhone uses for
telephone calls. It
naturally sits close
to your ear when-
ever you hold your
iPhone in the “talk-
ing on the phone”
position.
You should be the
only one who hears
sound coming from
the receiver. If you
have the volume 
set above about 50
percent and you’re
in a location with
little or no back-
ground noise, 
someone standing
nearby may be 
able to hear the 
sound too. So be
careful.
If you require privacy during phone calls, the headset is a better bet.
 Touchscreen: You find out how to use the iPhone’s gorgeous high-
resolution color touchscreen in Chapter 2. All we have to say at this 
time is try not to drool all over it.
 Home button: No matter what you’re doing, you can press the Home
button at any time to display the Home screen, which is the screen
shown in Figure 1-3.
 Application buttons: Each of the sixteen buttons launches an iPhone
application. You’ll read more about them later in this chapter and
throughout the rest of the book.
On the back
On the back of your iPhone is the camera lens. It’s the little circle in the top-
left corner. For more on the camera, see Chapter 9.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Status bar
The status bar, which is at the top of the screen, displays tiny icons that pro-
vide a variety of information about the current state of your iPhone:
 Cell signal: The cell signal icon tells you whether you’re within range of
the AT&T cellular network and therefore can make and receive calls. The
more bars you see (five is the highest), the stronger the cellular signal. If
you’re out of range, the bars are replaced with the words No service.
If you have only one or two bars, try moving around a little bit. Even
moving just a few feet can sometimes mean the difference between no
service and three or four bars.
 Airplane mode: You’re allowed to use your iPod on a plane after the cap-
tain gives the word. But you can’t use your cell phone except when the
plane is in the gate area before takeoff or after landing. Fortunately, your
iPhone offers an airplane mode, which turns off all wireless features of
your iPhone — the phone, Internet access, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth — and
makes it possible to enjoy music or video during your flight.
 Wi-Fi: If you see the Wi-Fi icon, it means your iPhone is connected to the
Internet over a Wi-Fi network. The more semicircular lines you see (up
to three), the stronger the Wi-Fi signal. Once again, if you have only one
or two bars of Wi-Fi strength, try moving around a bit. If you don’t see
the Wi-Fi icon in the status bar, Internet access is not currently available.
 EDGE: This icon tells you that AT&T’s EDGE network is available and
you can use it to connect to the Internet. If you don’t see the EDGE icon
in the status bar, Internet access is not currently available.
 Lock: This icon tells you when your iPhone is locked. See Chapter 2 for
information on locking and unlocking your iPhone.
 Play: This icon informs you that a song is currently playing. You find out
more about playing songs in Chapter 7.
 Alarm: This icon tells you that you have set one or more alarms in the
Clock application.
 Bluetooth: This icon indicates the current state of your iPhone’s
Bluetooth connection. If it’s blue, Bluetooth is on and a device (such as a
wireless headset or car kit) is connected. If the icon is gray, Bluetooth is
turned on but no device is connected. If you don’t see a Bluetooth icon,
Bluetooth is turned off. More on this in Chapter 15.
 Battery: This icon reflects the level of your battery’s charge. It’s com-
pletely filled when your battery is fully charged, and then empties out as
your battery becomes depleted. You’ll see a lightning bolt inside it when
your iPhone is recharging.

The iPhone’s Sweet Sixteen
The Home screen displays sixteen icons, each representing a different appli-
cation or function. Because the rest of the book covers all of them in greater
detail, we merely provide brief descriptions here.
Starting at the top left, the applications on your Home screen are as follows:
 Text: The Text application lets you exchange text messages with almost
any other cell phone user. We’ve used a lot of mobile phones in our day
and this application is as good as it gets.
 Calendar: No matter what calendar program you prefer on your PC or
Mac (as long as it’s iCal, Microsoft Entourage, or Microsoft Outlook), you
can synchronize events and alerts between your computer and your
iPhone. Create an event on one and it’s automatically synchronized with
the other the next time they’re connected. Neat stuff.
 Photos: This application is the iPhone’s terrific photo manager. You can
view pictures that you take with the iPhone’s built-in camera or photos
transferred from your computer. You can zoom in or out, create slide-
shows, e-mail photos to friends, and much more. Other phones may let
you take pictures; the iPhone lets you enjoy them in many ways. 
 Camera: Use this application when you want to shoot a picture with the
iPhone’s fine 2-megapixel camera.
 YouTube: This application lets you watch videos from the popular
YouTube Web site. You can search for a particular video or browse
through thousands of offerings. It’s a great way to waste a lot of time.
 Stocks: If you follow the market, this application lets you monitor your
favorite stocks, which are updated in near real time.
 Maps: This application is among our favorites. View street maps or satel-
lite imagery of locations around the globe, or ask for directions, traffic
conditions, or even the location of a nearby pizza joint. The only thing
that would make it even better would be GPS.
 Weather: This application monitors the six-day weather forecast for as
many cities as you like.
 Clock: This program lets you see the current time in as many cities as
you like, set one or more alarms for yourself, and use your iPhone as a
stopwatch or a countdown timer.
 Calculator: The Calculator application lets you perform addition, sub-
traction, multiplication, and division. Period.
15
Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone

16
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 Notes: This program lets you type notes while you’re out and about. You
can send the notes to yourself or anyone else through e-mail or just save
them on your iPhone until you need them.
 Settings: Use this application to adjust your iPhone’s settings. If you’re a
Mac user, think System Preferences; if you’re a Windows person, think
Control Panel.
 Phone: Tap this application icon to use the iPhone as a phone. What a
concept!
 Mail: This application lets you send and receive e-mail with most POP3
and IMAP e-mail systems.
 Safari: Safari is your Web browser. If you’re a Mac user, you know that
already; if you’re a Windows user, think Internet Explorer on steroids.
 iPod: Last but not least, this icon unleashes all the power of a video iPod
right on your phone.
Okay then. Now that you and your iPhone have been properly introduced, it’s
time to turn it on, activate it, and actually use it. Onward!

 Turning the device on and off
 Locking your iPhone
 Activating the iPhone
 Mastering multitouch
T
he last time you bought a cell phone, the process probably went some-
thing like this: You wandered into a wireless store unsure what you
wanted. You checked out a few models in your price range and chose one
that met your budget, feature requirements, and sense of style. You waited
patiently while the friendly (we hope) salesperson recorded some vital infor-
mation and eventually activated the phone.
By now, of course, you know that the iPhone is a very different
deal. Amidst extraordinary buzz, you plotted for months
about how to land one. After all, the iPhone is the ultimate
fashion phone, and the chic device also hosts a bevy of
cool features. (Keep reading this book for proof.) To
snatch the very first version, you may have had to
save your pennies — or at least said “the budget be
damned.” Owning the hippest and most hyped hand-
set on the planet comes at a premium cost com-
pared with rival devices.
Something else is different about the iPhone purchas-
ing experience: the way it’s activated. No salesperson
is going to guide you through the process, whether you
picked up your newly prized possession in an Apple retail
store, an AT&T retail store, or on the Web. Instead, you are
supposed to handle activation solo, in the comfort of your 
own home.

Fortunately, as with most products with an Apple pedigree, the process of
getting up to speed with the iPhone is dirt simple and fun. Although hiccups
are possible — just ask some of the folks who bought an iPhone in the days
following its June 29, 2007 debut — activation should go smoothly. If you do
need assistance, let this chapter be your guide.
Turning the iPhone On and Off
Apple has taken the time to partially charge your iPhone, so you’ll get some
measure of instant gratification. After taking it out of the box, press and hold
the Sleep/Wake button on the top-right edge. (Refer to Chapter 1 for the loca-
tion of all buttons.) The famous Apple logo should show up on your screen,
followed a few seconds later by a stunning image of Earth.
Not so subtle message: Apple has ambitious aspirations about capturing
global market share.
The words Activate iPhone appear at the top of the screen above the home
planet, accompanied by a message to Connect to iTunes.
You are permitted at this initial stage to make an emergency call by using
your finger to slide the arrow at the bottom of the display to the right. It’s a
bit startling to see the emergency option on this early screen. Here’s hoping
that your first act as an iPhone owner will not land you or a loved one in the
hospital.
To turn the device completely off, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button
again until a red arrow appears at the top of the screen. Then drag the arrow
to the right with your finger.
Locking the iPhone
A naked cell phone in your pocket is asking for trouble. Unless the phone has
some locking mechanism, you may inadvertently dial a phone number. Try
explaining to your boss why he or she got a call from you at 4 A.M. Fortunately,
Apple makes it a cinch to lock the iPhone so that this scenario won’t happen 
to you.
In fact, you don’t need to do anything to lock the iPhone; it happens automat-
ically, as long as you don’t touch the screen for a minute.

Can’t wait? To lock the iPhone immediately, press the Sleep/Wake button. To
unlock it, press the Sleep/Wake button again. Or press the Home button on
the front of the screen, and then drag the onscreen slider to the right with
your finger.
By now you’re picking up on the idea that your fingers play an important role
in controlling your iPhone. We talk more about the role your digits play later
in this chapter.
Activating the iPhone
There are two prerequisites for enjoying the iPhone. First, you have to
become or already be an AT&T (U.S.), T-Mobile (Germany), O2 (U.K.), or
Orange (France) customer. Read the sidebar titled “The Great Escape: Bailing
out of your wireless contract,” later in this chapter, if you are in the middle of
a contract with a rival wireless phone company.
Second, make sure you download the latest version of iTunes software onto
your PC or Mac. Apple doesn’t supply the software in the box, so head to
www.apple.com/itunes if you need to fetch a copy or launch your current
version of iTunes, and choose Check for Updates. You’ll find it under the Help
menu on a Windows machine and the iTunes menu on a Mac.
For the uninitiated, iTunes is the nifty Apple jukebox software that iPod
owners and many other people use to manage music, videos, and more.
iTunes is at the core of the iPhone as well, because an iPod is built into the
iPhone. You’ll employ iTunes to synchronize a bunch of stuff on your com-
puter and iPhone: contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, bookmarks, photos,
videos, and of course music. And from the get-go, you’ll use iTunes to acti-
vate the phone.
Here’s how to proceed with setup:
1. Locate an available USB port on your PC or Mac to connect the dock.
Slide the iPhone into its dock.
Hold your excitement as the first Welcome toYour New iPhone greeting is
displayed inside iTunes, as shown in Figure 2-1.
2. Click Continue to get on with the show.
3. Select whether or not you are already an AT&T (or Cingular) wireless
customer, and then click Continue.
The screen displayed in Figure 2-2 appears.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Figure 2-1: Welcome to the iPhone, you lucky dog.
Figure 2-2: Requesting or renewing your AT&T credentials.

4. Based on the decision in Step 3, select among the following options.
Then click Continue.
If you’re in the AT&T stable, you can either add a new line to an existing
account or replace your current phone with the iPhone. If you’re an
AT&T newbie, you can activate either a single iPhone or — you’d be the
envy of your neighborhood — two or more iPhones under a family plan.
5. (Optional) You have the option of transferring an existing cell phone
number from another wireless provider to the iPhone, a process that
Apple says may take up to six hours.
If you want to do so, select the Transfer Existing Mobile Number box and
fill in your existing phone number, account number, zip code, and
account password (if applicable). There are plenty of good reasons for
keeping your old number, not least of which is to brag to friends that
they’re calling you on an iPhone. Although you’ll be able to make outgo-
ing calls at this juncture, you won’t be able to receive any until the trans-
fer is complete. Then proceed with Step 7.
6. Click Continue.
7. Choose your monthly wireless plans from AT&T, and then click
Continue.
Figure 2-3 shows the most common options for voice minutes and text
messages as of this writing. Click the arrow next to More Minutes to
check out higher-priced plans. Click Less Minutes to return to the lower-
priced options.
Pay heed to the fine print. You better learn to love AT&T because, for
better or worse, they’re going to be your wireless carrier for at least the
next two years. The iPhone is not compatible with Verizon Wireless,
Sprint, or any other US carrier.
8. If you have an Apple ID, type your Apple ID and password. Then click
Continue.
9. Enter your date of birth and select the appropriate boxes if you want
to receive e-mail on new releases and additions to the iTunes Store or
special offers and information about other Apple products. Then click
Continue.
10. Well, you knew they would get around to it sooner or later. In the next
screens, enter your billing address and acknowledge that you have
read both Apple’s iPhone Terms & Conditions and AT&T’s Service
Agreement (if you’re new to AT&T). Click Continue to move from
screen to screen.
I don’t know anyone without a law degree who actually reads these
things. But high up in the AT&T agreement you learn that you’re subject
to a $175 early termination fee should you decide to bail out of your con-
tract. Ouch!

11. You get one more shot to review your information. If your address
and the iPhone plan are accurate, click Submit to authorize AT&T to
perform a credit check and initiate service (again, if you’re new to
AT&T).
Click Go Back to make changes. Processing the activation could take up
to three minutes, assuming there are no snags.
If you don’t pass the credit check, all is not lost. As this book was being
prepared, AT&T was offering a prepaid plan for the iPhone (though the
rates are not as attractive). The plan is not available to customers
whose credit is A-OK.

12. If all is peachy, your new mobile number, assuming you didn’t keep
your old one, is displayed on the computer screen.
Meanwhile, the iPhone will notify you when activation is complete and
send an e-mail to the address you designated.
13. Click Continue to begin syncing your iPhone with your contacts, cal-
endars, e-mail accounts, bookmarks, music, photos, and pictures.

The Great Escape: Bailing out of your 
wireless contract
In most instances, a wireless provider will sell
you a deeply discounted phone or even issue
you a free model. But there’s one expensive
catch. You’re subject to hefty termination fees if
you bail out of your (typical) two-year contract
early.
The iPhone is one Cingular . . . make that AT&T
sensation (bad pun intended), so you’ll have to
wave sayonara to Sprint, Verizon, or other car-
riers if you want a device. But breaking a cell
phone contract is not easy, and some of the
options for doing so may not be quite the outs
you had in mind: You can enlist in the military,
move overseas, even die. (But then AT&T’s cov-
erage may not reach heaven.)
Fortunately, there are other options, though
none are guaranteed to work:
 Complain loudly and often: If you’ve been
having problems with your existing carrier,
contact the phone company and tell them
how lousy your coverage is. Document your
complaints in writing and be as specific 
as possible about spots where your calls
drop out.
 Keep an eye out for price hikes: If the car-
rier ups rates dramatically on text messag-
ing, say, you may have a legal out in your
contract. The Consumerist.com Web
site advises you to read any notices of
changes to your Terms of Service that come
your way. These may void the original
agreement and you’ll have about a month to
cancel your contract.
 Use online matchmaking: Sites such as
www.celltradeusa.com and www.cell
swapper.com are in the business of
matching users who want to get out of their
contract with other folks who are seeking a
bargain. The person trying to ditch a con-
tract pays a modest fee to these sites. The
motivation for the person who takes the
contract off your hands? They need not pay
an activation fee to the carrier and have no
long-term commitment of their own.
 Roam, roam on the range: If you keep using
your phone outside your carrier’s network,
it may become uneconomical for them to
want to keep you. That’s because your
phone company picks up expensive roam-
ing charges.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Mastering the Multitouch Interface
Virtually every cell phone known to mankind has a physical (typically plas-
tic) dialing keypad, if not also a more complete QWERTY-style keyboard, to
bang out e-mails and text messages. The iPhone dispenses with both. Apple
is once again living up to an old company advertising slogan to “Think
Different.”
Indeed, the iPhone removes the usual physical buttons in favor of a so-called
multitouch display. It is the heart of many things you do on the iPhone, and
the controls change depending on the task at hand.
Unlike other phones with touchscreens, don’t bother looking for a stylus. You
are meant, instead — to lift another ancient ad slogan — to “let your fingers
do the walking.”
The first thing to note is that there are actually three keyboard layouts: the
alphabetical keyboard, the numeric and punctuation keyboard, and the more
punctuation and symbols keyboard. All three are shown in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4: The three faces of the iPhone keyboard.
Delete
(Backspace) key     
Return key     
Shift key     
Toggle key     

There are four keys that don’t actually type a character: the Shift, Toggle,
Delete, and Return keys:
 Toggle key: Switches between the different keyboard layouts.
 Shift key: If you’re using the alphabetical keyboard, the Shift key
switches between uppercase and lowercase letters. If you’re using either
of the other two keyboards, pressing Shift switches to the other one.
To turn on Caps Lock and type in all caps, you first need to enable Caps
Lock. You do that by tapping the Settings icon, then tapping General,
and then tapping Keyboard. Tap the Enable Caps Lock item to turn it on.
Once the Caps Lock setting is enabled (it’s disabled by default), you
double-tap the Shift key to turn on Caps Lock. (The Shift key turns blue
whenever Caps Lock is on.) Tap the Shift key again to turn off Caps Lock.
To disable Caps Lock completely, just reverse the process by turning off
the Enable Caps Lock setting (tap Settings, General, Keyboard).
 Delete key: Erases the character immediately to the left of the cursor.
If you hold down the Delete key for a few seconds, it begins erasing
entire words rather than individual characters.
 Return key: Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
The incredible, intelligent, and 
virtual iPhone keyboard
Before we consider how to actually use the keyboard, we’d like to share a bit
of the philosophy behind its so-called intelligence. Knowing what makes this
keyboard smart will help you make it even smarter when you use it:
 It has a built-in English dictionary that even includes words from today’s
popular culture.
 It adds your contacts to its dictionary automatically.
 It uses complex analysis algorithms to predict the word you’re trying 
to type.
 It suggests corrections as you type. It then offers you the suggested
word just below the misspelled word. When you decline a suggestion
and the word you typed is not in the iPhone dictionary, the iPhone will
add that word to its dictionary and offer it as a suggestion if you mistype
it in the future.
Remember to decline suggestions — doing so helps your intelligent key-
board become even smarter.

Chapter 2: Basic Training

26
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 It reduces the number of mistakes you make as you type by intelligently
and dynamically resizing the touch zones for certain keys. You can’t see
it, but it is increasing the zones for keys it predicts might come next and
decreasing the zones for keys that are unlikely or impossible to come
next.
Training your digits
Rice Krispies has Snap! Crackle! Pop! Apple’s response for the iPhone is Tap!
Flick! and Pinch! Yikes, another ad comparison.
Fortunately, tapping, flicking, and pinching are not challenging gestures, so
you’ll be mastering many of the iPhone’s features in no time:
 Tap: Tapping serves multiple purposes, as will become evident through-
out this book. You can tap an icon to open an application from the Home
screen. Tap to start playing a song or to choose the photo album you
want to look through. Sometimes you will double-tap (tapping twice in
rapid succession), which has the effect of zooming in (or out) of Web
pages, maps, and e-mails.
 Flick: Just what it sounds like. A flick of the finger on the screen itself
lets you quickly scroll through lists of songs, e-mails, and picture thumb-
nails. Tap on the screen to stop scrolling or merely wait for the scrolling
list to stop.
 Pinch: Place two fingers on the edges of a Web page or picture to
enlarge the images or make them smaller. Pinching is a cool gesture that
is easy to master and sure to wow an audience. If you need practice,
visit the Apple iPhone blogs at www.theiphoneblogs.com/2007/
01/12/practice-your-apple-iphone-pinch/.
Finger-typing
Apple’s multitouch interface just might be considered a stroke of genius. And
it just might as equally drive you nuts, at least initially.
If you’re patient and trusting, you’ll get the hang of finger-typing in a week or
so. You have to rely on the virtual keyboard (which appears when you tap a
text field) to enter notes, compose text messages, type the names of new con-
tacts, and so forth.
Apple’s own recommendation — which we concur with — is to start typing
with just your index finger before graduating to two thumbs.

The good news is that Apple has built a lot
of intelligence into its virtual keyboard, so it
can correct typing mistakes on-the-fly and
take a stab at predicting what you are about
to type next. The keyboard isn’t exactly
Nostradamus, but it does a pretty good job
in coming up with the words you have in
mind.
As you press your finger against a letter or
number on the screen, the individual key
you press gets bigger and practically jumps
off the screen, as shown in Figure 2-5. That
way, you know that you struck the correct
letter or number.
Alas, mistakes are common at first. Say you
meant to type a sentence in the Notes appli-
cation that reads, “I am typing a bunch of
notes.” But because of the way your fingers
struck the virtual keys, you actually entered
“I am typing a bunch of npyrs. Fortunately,
Apple knows that the o you meant to press
is next to the p that showed up on the 
27
Chapter 2: Basic Training
Fingers or thumbs?
There is one last thing: Should you use your fin-
gers or thumbs to type? The answer is: Both. It
seems somewhat easier to hold the iPhone in
your nondominant hand (that is, your left hand if
you’re right handed or vice versa) and type with
the index finger of your dominant hand, espe-
cially when you’re first starting out with the
iPhone. And that’s what we suggest you try first.
Later, when you get the hang of typing with one
index finger, you can try to speed things up by
using both hands. There are two possible ways
you can do it:
 Set the iPhone on a sturdy surface (such as
a desk or table) and tap with both index fin-
gers. Some users prefer this technique. But
you can’t easily use it when you’re standing
up with no sturdy surface of the proper
height available.
 Cup the iPhone with both hands and type
with both thumbs. This technique has the
advantage of being possible in almost any
situation with or without a sturdy surface.
The downside is that your thumbs are bigger
than your fingers so it takes more practice
to type accurately with them.
Which is better? Don’t ask us — try it both ways
and use the method that feels the most comfort-
able or lets you type with the best accuracy.
Better still, master both techniques and use
whichever is more appropriate at the time.
Figure 2-5: The ABC’s of virtual typing.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
keyboard, just as t and y and the e and the r
are side-by-side. So the software determines
that notes was indeed the word you had in
mind and places it in red under the suspect
word, as shown in Figure 2-6. To accept the
suggested word, merely tap the Space key.
And if for some reason you actually did mean
to type npyrs instead, tap on the suggested
word (notes in this example) to decline it.
Moreover, because Apple knows what you
are up to, the virtual keyboard is fine-tuned
for the task at hand. If you’re entering a Web
address, for example, the keyboard inside the
Safari Web browser (see Chapter 10) includes
dedicated period, forward slash, and .com
keys but no Space key. If you’re using the
Notes application (see Chapter 5), the key-
board does have a Space key. And if you’re
composing an e-mail message, a dedicated 
@ key pops up on the keyboard.
When you’re typing notes or sending e-mail
and want to type a number, symbol, or
punctuation mark, you have to tap the .?123
key to bring up an alternative virtual key-
board. Tap the ABC key to return to the first
keyboard. It’s not hard to get used to, but
some may find this extra step irritating.
Editing mistakes
It’s a good idea to type with reckless aban-
don and not get hung up over the characters
you mistype. Again, the self-correcting key-
board will indeed fix many errors. That said,
plenty of typos will likely turn up, especially
in the beginning, and you’ll have to make
corrections manually.
A neat trick for doing so is to hold your
finger against the screen to bring up the
magnifying glass shown in Figure 2-7. Use it
to position the pointer to the spot where you
need to make the correction.
There, you’ve survived basic training. Now
the real fun is about to begin.

you out.

to and from Your iPhone
In This Chapter
 Starting your first sync
 Disconnecting during a sync
 Synchronizing contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, and bookmarks manually
 Synchronizing music, podcasts, video, and photos
W
hen you have activated your iPhone and have passed basic training
(in Chapter 2), the next thing you’re likely to want to do is get some or
all of your contacts, appointments, events, mail settings, bookmarks, music,
movies, TV shows, podcasts, and photos into your iPhone.
We have good news and . . . more good news. The good news
is that you can easily copy any or all of those items from
your computer to your iPhone. And the more good
news is that once you do that, you can synchronize
your contacts, appointments, and events so they are
kept up-to-date automatically in both places — on
your computer and your iPhone — whenever you
make a change in one place or the other. So when
you add or change an appointment, an event, or a
contact on your iPhone, that information automati-
cally appears on your computer the next time your
iPhone and computer get together.
This process is called syncing (short for synchronizing)
your iPhone and computer. Don’t worry: It’s easy, and we’re
going to walk you through the entire process in this chapter.
But wait. There’s even more good news. Items you manage on your computer —
such as music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, photos, and e-mail account 
settings — are synchronized only one way: from your computer to your 
iPhone, which is the way it should be.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Starting to Sync
Synchronizing your iPhone with your computer is a lot like syncing an iPod
with your computer. If you’re an iPod user, the process will be a piece of cake.
But it’s not too difficult even for those who’ve never used an iPod:
1. Start by connecting your iPhone to your computer using the dock and
the dock connector–to–USB cable, both of which were in the box with
your iPhone.
Technically, the dock is optional. You can just plug the dock connector
on the cable into your iPhone. Synchronization (and recharging) will
work perfectly either way, so it’s up to you.
When you connect your iPhone to your computer, iTunes should launch
automatically. If it doesn’t, chances are you plugged the cable into a USB
port on your keyboard, monitor, or hub. Try plugging it into one of the
USB ports on your computer instead. Why? Because USB ports on your
computer supply more power to a connected device than USB ports on a
keyboard, monitor, or most hubs.
If iTunes still doesn’t launch automatically, try launching it manually.
One last thing: If you’ve taken any photos with your iPhone since the
last time you synced it, your photo management software (iPhoto on the
Mac; Adobe Photoshop Album or Elements on the PC) will launch and
ask if you want to import the photos from your phone. You’ll find out all
about this later in the chapter.
2. Select your iPhone in the iTunes source list.
You see the Set Up Your iPhone pane, as shown in Figure 3-1.
If you don’t see an iPhone in the source list, and you’re sure it’s con-
nected to a USB port on your computer (not the keyboard, monitor, or
hub), restart your computer.
3. Name your iPhone.
We’ve cleverly named this one MyiPhone.
4. Decide whether you want iTunes to automatically synchronize 
your iPhone and your contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, and 
bookmarks.
• If that’s what you want, just select the check box, click Done, and
continue with the “Synchronizing Your Media” section.
• If you want to synchronize manually, click Done. The “Synchronizing
Your Data” section tells you all about how to configure your con-
tacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, and bookmarks manually.
We’ve chosen to not select the check box because this computer has
four e-mail accounts and we don’t want all of them to synchronize with
the iPhone.

Figure 3-1: This is the first thing you’ll see in iTunes.
After you click the Done button, the Summary pane should appear. If it
doesn’t, make sure your iPhone is still selected in the source list and
click the Summary tab near the top of the window, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: The Summary pane is pretty painless.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
5. If you want iTunes to sync your iPhone automatically whenever you
connect it to your computer, select the Automatically Sync When This
iPhone Is Connected check box (in the Options area).
Don’t select it if you want to sync manually by clicking the Sync button
at the bottom of the window.
6. If you want to sync only items that are selected in your iTunes library,
select the Only Sync Checked Items check box.
Your choice in Step 5 not set in stone. If you select the Automatically Sync
When This iPhone Is Connected check box, you can still prevent your iPhone
from syncing automatically in several different ways:
 Way #1: After you connect the iPhone to your computer, click the
Summary tab in iTunes and then deselect Automatically Sync When This
iPhone Is Connected. This will also prevent iTunes from opening auto-
matically when you connect the iPhone. If you use this method, you can
still start a sync manually.
 Way #2: Launch iTunes, and then before you connect your iPhone to
your computer, press and hold Command+Option (Mac) or Shift+Control
(PC) until you see your iPhone in the iTunes source list. This method
prevents your iPhone from syncing automatically just this one time,
without changing any settings.
And, of course, if you uncheck the Automatically Sync When This iPhone Is
Connected check box, you can always synchronize manually by clicking the
Summary tab and then clicking the Sync button in the bottom-right corner of
the window.
By the way, if you’ve changed any sync settings since the last time you syn-
chronized, the Sync button will instead say Apply.
Disconnecting the iPhone
When the iPhone is syncing with your computer, its screen says Sync in
progress and iTunes displays a message that says it’s syncing with your
iPhone. When the sync is finished, iTunes displays a message that the iPhone
sync is complete and it’s okay to disconnect your iPhone.
If you disconnect your iPhone before a sync is completed, all or part of the
sync may fail.
To cancel a sync so you can safely disconnect your iPhone, drag the slider on
the iPhone (the one that says Slide to Cancel) during the sync.

If you get a call while you’re syncing, the sync is canceled automatically so
you can safely disconnect your iPhone and answer the call. When you’re 
finished with the call, just reconnect your iPhone to restart the sync.
Synchronizing Your Data
Did you choose to set up data synchronization manually (by not selecting the
Automatically Sync Contacts, Calendars, Email Accounts, and Bookmarks
check box in the Set Up Your iPhone pane shown in Figure 3-1)? If so, your
next order of business is to tell iTunes what data you want to synchronize
between your iPhone and your computer. You do this by clicking the Info tab,
which is to the right of the Summary tab.
The Info pane has five sections: Contacts, Calendars, Mail Accounts, Web
Browser, and Advanced. Let’s take a look at them one by one.
Contacts
The Contacts section of the Info pane determines how synchronization is
handled for your contacts. One method is to synchronize all of your contacts,
as shown in Figure 3-3. Or you can synchronize any or all groups of contacts
you’ve created in your computer’s address book program; just click the
appropriate check boxes and only those groups will be synchronized.
Figure 3-3: Want to synchronize your contacts? This is where you set things up.
The iPhone syncs with the following address book programs:
 Mac: Address Book and other address books that sync with Address
Book, such as Microsoft Entourage and Yahoo! Address Book
 PC: Yahoo! Address Book, Windows Address Book (Outlook Express),
and Microsoft Outlook
33
Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone

34
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
If you use Yahoo! Address Book, click Configure to enter your Yahoo! ID and
password. Also, syncing will never delete a contact from your Yahoo! Address
Book if it has a Messenger ID, even if you delete that contact on the iPhone or
on your computer.
To delete a contact that has a Messenger ID, log in to your Yahoo! account
with a Web browser and delete the contact in Yahoo! Address Book.
Calendars
The Calendars section of the Info pane determines how synchronization is
handled for your appointments and events. You can synchronize all of your
calendars, as shown in Figure 3-4. Or you can synchronize any or all individ-
ual calendars you’ve created in your computer’s calendar program. Just click
the appropriate check boxes.
Figure 3-4: Set up sync for your calendar events here.
The iPhone syncs with the following calendar programs:
 Mac: iCal, plus any tasks or events that currently sync with iCal on your
Mac, such as events and tasks in Microsoft Entourage
 PC: Microsoft Outlook
One cool thing about syncing your calendar is that if you create reminders,
alerts, or alarms in your computer’s calendar program, they appear (and
sound) on your iPhone at the appropriate date and time.
Mail accounts
You can sync account settings for your e-mail accounts in the Mail Accounts
section of the Info pane. You can synchronize all of your e-mail accounts 
(if you have more than one), or you can synchronize individual accounts 
as shown in Figure 3-5. Just click the appropriate check boxes.

Figure 3-5: Transfer e-mail account settings to your iPhone here.
The iPhone syncs with the following mail programs:
 Mac: Mail and Microsoft Entourage
 PC: Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express
E-mail account settings are synchronized only one way: from your computer
to your iPhone. If you make changes to any e-mail account settings on your
iPhone, the changes will not be synchronized back to the e-mail account on
your computer. Trust us, this is a very good feature and we’re glad Apple did
it this way.
By the way, the password for your e-mail account may or may not be saved
on your computer. If you sync an e-mail account and the iPhone asks for a
password when you send or receive mail, do this: Tap Settings on the Home
screen, tap Mail, tap your e-mail account’s name, and then type your pass-
word in the appropriate field.
Web browser
The Web Browser section has but a single check box, which asks if you want
to sync your bookmarks. Select it if you do; don’t select it if you don’t.
The iPhone syncs bookmarks with the following Web browsers:
 Mac: Safari
 PC: Microsoft Internet Explorer and Safari
Advanced
Every so often the contacts, calendars, mail accounts, or bookmarks on 
your iPhone get so screwed up that the easiest way to fix things is to erase
that information on your iPhone and replace it with information from your
computer.
35
Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone

36
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
If that’s the case, just click the appropriate check boxes, as shown in 
Figure 3-6. Then the next time you sync, that information on your iPhone 
will be replaced with information from your computer.
Figure 3-6: Replace the information on your iPhone with the information on your computer.
Because the Advanced section is at the bottom of the Info pane and you have
to scroll down to see it, it’s easy to forget that it’s there. Try not to. Although
you probably won’t need to use this feature very often (if ever), you’ll be
happy you remembered that it’s there if you do need it.
Synchronizing Your Media
If you’re among the readers who chose to let iTunes manage synchronizing
their data automatically, welcome back. Now let’s look at how you get your
media — your music, podcasts, video, and photos — from your computer to
your iPhone.
Music, podcasts, and video (but not photos) are synced only one way: from
your computer to your iPhone. Deleting any of these items from your iPhone
will not delete them from your computer when you sync.
Music, podcasts, and video
You use the Music, Podcasts, and Video panes to specify the media that you
want to copy from your computer to your iPhone. To view any of these
panes, make sure that your iPhone is still selected in the source list and then
click the Music, Podcasts, or Video tab near the top of the window.
Music
To transfer music to your iPhone, select the Sync Music check box in the
Music pane. Then you can choose all songs and playlists or only selected
playlists. You can also choose to include music videos. See Figure 3-7.

Figure 3-7: Use the Music pane to copy music from your computer to your iPhone.
If you choose All Songs and Playlists and have more songs in your iTunes
library than storage space on your iPhone — just over 7GB on an 8GB iPhone
— you’ll see one or both of the error messages shown in Figure 3-8 when you
try to sync.
Figure 3-8: If you have more music than your iPhone has room for, this is what you’ll see when
you sync.
37
Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone

38
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
To avoid these errors, select playlists that total less than 3 or 7 gigabytes.
Music, podcasts, and video are notorious for chewing up massive amounts of
storage space on your iPhone. If you try to sync too much media, you’ll see
lots of error messages like the ones in Figure 3-8. Forewarned is forearmed.
Podcasts
To transfer podcasts to your iPhone, select the Sync check box in the
Podcasts pane. Then you can choose all podcasts or only selected playlists,
as shown in Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-9: The Podcasts pane determines which podcasts will be copied to your iPhone.
Regardless of whether you choose to sync all podcasts or only selected pod-
casts, a pop-up menu allows you to specify which episodes you want to sync,
as shown in Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-10: This menu determines how podcasts are synced with your iPhone.

Video
To transfer TV shows and movies to your iPhone, select the appropriate
check boxes in the Video pane, as shown in Figure 3-11.
Figure 3-11: Your choices in the Video pane determine which TV shows and movies are copied
to your iPhone.
The procedure for syncing TV shows is slightly different from the procedure
for syncing movies. First, select the Sync check box to enable TV show sync-
ing. Then choose either All TV Shows or Selected. If you go with Selected, you
can then choose between TV Shows and Playlists from the pop-up menu
(which says TV Shows in Figure 3-11).
Next, choose how many episodes you want to sync from the pop-up menu
shown in Figure 3-12 (which says 3 Most Recent Unwatched in Figure 3-11).
Figure 3-12: This menu determines how TV shows are synced with your iPhone.
39
Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone

40
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
To sync movies, you need to first select the Sync Movies check box, and then
select the check boxes of the individual movies you want to sync.
Photos
Syncing photos is a little different from syncing other media because your
iPhone has a built-in camera and you may want to copy pictures you take
with the iPhone to your computer as well as copy pictures stored on your
computer to your iPhone.
The iPhone syncs photos with the following programs:
 Mac: iPhoto version 4.03 or later, Aperture, and any folder that contains
images
 PC: Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 or later, Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0
or later, and any folder that contains images
To sync photos, click the Photos tab near the top of the window. In the Photos
pane, select the Sync Photos From check box and then choose an application
or folder from the pop-up menu (which says iPhoto in Figure 3-13).
Figure 3-13: The Photos pane determines which photos will be synchronized with your iPhone.

If you choose an application that supports photo albums, as we have in
Figure 3-13, you can select specific albums. If you choose a folder full of
images, you can create subfolders inside it which will appear as albums on
your iPhone. But if you choose an application that doesn’t support albums,
or a single folder full of images (with no subfolders), it’s all or nothing.
You can rearrange the album list by clicking an album name and dragging it
up or down in the list.
If you’ve taken any photos with your iPhone since the last time you synced it,
the appropriate program will launch (or the appropriate folder will be
selected) and you’ll have the option of downloading the pictures to your
computer. The process is the same as when you download pictures from your
digital camera.
How much space did I use?
If you’re interested in knowing how much free space is available on your
iPhone, look near the bottom of the iTunes window while your iPhone is
selected in the source list. You’ll see a chart that shows the contents of your
iPhone, color-coded for your convenience. As you can see in Figure 3-14, this
8GB iPhone has roughly 3.73GB of free space available.
Figure 3-14: This handy chart tells you how much space is being used on your iPhone.
The chart appears at the bottom of the iTunes window regardless of which
pane is currently selected.
For those who are wondering, Other is the catchall category for contacts, cal-
endars, appointments, events, bookmarks, and e-mail stored on your phone.
In our case, the total of these items is a mere 37MB, a tiny fraction of the total
storage space available on this iPhone.

The Mobile iPhone

Your iPhone is ﬁrst and foremost a mobile
phone, so in this part we explore how to use
typical mobile phone features, starting with all the
neat ways to make an outgoing phone call. You
also ﬁnd out how to answer or ignore the calls
that come in and discover iPhone’s clever visual
voicemail feature, which lets you take in messages
on your terms, rather than in the order in which
the messages arrived on the phone. You also
ﬁgure out how to juggle calls, merge calls, and
decide on a ringtone.
Then, after you’ve mastered all the calling and 
listening stuff, you are ready to become a whiz at
sending and retrieving what are called SMS text
messages. As journalists, we especially appreciate

ments and — thanks to a built-in alarm clock —
show up for them on time.

You may well have bought an iPhone for its spectacular photo viewer,
marvelous widescreen iPod, and the best darn pocket-size
Internet browser you’ll ever come across. Not to mention its
overall coolness.
For most of us, though, cool goes only so far. The
iPhone’s most critical mission is the one from which
its name is derived — it is first and foremost a cell
phone. And no matter how capable it is at all those
other things, when push comes to shove you had
best be able to make and receive phone calls.
That puts a lot of responsibility in the hands of AT&T
(formerly Cingular Wireless), the iPhone’s exclusive
wireless carrier. As with any cell phone, the strength of
the wireless signal depends a great deal on your location
and the robustness of the carrier’s network.
As noted in Chapter 1, the cell signal status icon at the upper-
left corner of the screen can clue you in on what your phone calling 
experience may be like. Simply put, more bars equates to a better experience.
What you hope to avoid are those two dreaded words, No Service.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Cell coverage aside, this chapter is devoted to all the nifty ways to handle
wireless calls on an iPhone.
Somewhere Alexander Graham Bell is beaming.
Making a Call
Start by tapping the Phone icon on the Home screen. You can then make calls
by tapping on any of the icons that show up at the bottom of the screen:
Favorites, Recents, Contacts, Keypad, or Voicemail. Depending on the circum-
stances, one of these could be the most appropriate method. Let’s take them
one by one.
Contacts
If you read the chapter on syncing (Chapter 3), you know how to get the
snail-mail addresses, e-mail addresses, and (most relevant for this chapter)
phone numbers that reside on your PC or Mac into the iPhone. Assuming you
went through that drill already, all those addresses and phone numbers are
hanging out in one place. Their not-so-secret hiding place is revealed when
you tap the Contacts icon inside the Phone application.
Here’s how to make those contacts work to your benefit:
1. Inside the Phone application, tap Contacts.
2. Flick your finger so that the list of contacts on the screen scrolls
rapidly up or down, loosely reminiscent of the spinning Lucky 7s 
(or other pictures) on a Las Vegas slot machine.
Think of the payout you’d get with that kind of power on a One-Armed
Bandit.
Alternatively, you can tap one of the teeny-tiny letters to the right side of
your Contacts list to jump to names that begin with that letter.
3. When you’re at or near the appropriate contact name, stop the
scrolling by tapping the screen.
Note that when you tap to stop the scrolling, that tap doesn’t select an
item in the list. That may seem counterintuitive the first few times you
try it, but we got used to it and now we really like it this way.
4. Tap the name of the person you want to call.
As shown in Figure 4-1, you’ll notice a bunch of fields with the individ-
ual’s phone numbers, physical and e-mail addresses, and possibly even
their mug.

And since odds are pretty good that the
person has more than one phone number, the
hardest decision you must make is choosing
which of those to call. When you’ve reached a
decision, tap the number, and the iPhone initi-
ates the call.
Your own iPhone phone number, lest you
forget it, is always shown at the top of the
Contacts list.
You can also initiate text messages and
e-mails from within Contacts. Those topics
are discussed in greater depth in Chapters 5
and 11, respectively.
Favorites
Consider Favorites the iPhone equivalent of
speed dialing. It’s where you can keep a list of
the people and numbers you dial most often.
Merely tap the person’s name in Favorites and
your iPhone calls the person.
You can set up as many favorites as you need
for a person. So, for example, you may create separate favorites listings for
your spouse’s office phone number and cell number.
Setting up favorites is a breeze. You may have noticed a button on the
Contacts screen labeled Add to Favorites. When you tap that button, all the
phone numbers you have for that person pop up. Tap the number you want
to make a favorite and it will turn up on the list.
You can rearrange the order in which your favorites are displayed. Tap Edit,
and then, to the right of the person you want to move, press your finger
against the symbol that looks like three short horizontal lines stacked on top
of one another. Drag that symbol to the place on the list where you want your
favorite contact to appear.
You can designate new favorites from within the Favorites application by tap-
ping on the + symbol at the upper-right corner of the screen. Doing so brings
you back to Contacts. From there, choose the appropriate person and number.
47
Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
Figure 4-1: Contact me.

48
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
If one of your chosen folks falls out of favor,
you can easily kick them off the Favorites
roster. Here’s how.
1. Tap the Edit button in the upper-left
corner of the screen.
You’ll notice that a red circle with a 
horizontal white line appears to the left
of each name in the list.
2. Tap the circle next to the A-lister 
getting the heave-ho.
The horizontal white line is now verti-
cal and a red Remove button appears to
the right of the name, as shown in
Figure 4-2.
3. Tap Remove.
The person (or one of their given phone
numbers) is no longer afforded the privi-
lege of being in your iPhone inner circle.
Booting someone off the Favorites list does
not remove them from the main Contacts list.
Recents
Tapping the Recents icon displays the iPhone call log. The Recents feature
will house logs of all the, well, recent calls made or received, as well as calls
that you missed. Here’s a tricky concept: Tap All to show all the recent calls
and Missed to show just those you missed. Under the All list, completed calls
are shown in black and missed calls are in red.
By tapping the small blue circle with the right-pointing arrow next to the list,
you can access information about the time a call was made or missed, as well
as any known information about the caller from your Contacts information.
To return a call, just tap anywhere on the name.
If one of the calls you missed came from someone who isn’t already in your
Contacts, you can add him or her. Tap the right-pointing arrow, and then tap
the Create New Contact button.
If the person is among your Contacts but has a new number, tap the Add to
Existing Contact button.
When the list gets too long, tap Clear to clean it up.
Figure 4-2: I don’t like you anymore.

Keypad
From time to time, of course, you have to
dial the number of a person or company
who hasn’t earned a spot in your Contacts.
That’s when you’ll want to tap the keypad
icon to bring up the large keys of the virtual
touch-tone keypad you see in Figure 4-3.
Despite what you may have read elsewhere,
we find it surprisingly simple to manually
dial a number on this keypad. Just tap the
appropriate keys and tap Call.
About our only quibble is that you won’t be
able to dial without looking at the screen;
dialing without looking is possible on at
least some of the handsets with physical
keypads.
You can use the iPhone’s keypad also to
remotely check your voicemail at work or
home.
Come to think of it, what a perfect segue to
the next section. It’s on one of our favorite
iPhone features, visual voicemail.
Visual voicemail
How often have you had to listen to four or five (or more) voicemail mes-
sages before getting to the message you really want, or need, to hear? As
shown in Figure 4-4, the iPhone’s clever visual voicemail presents a list of
your voicemail messages in the order in which calls were received. But you
need not listen to those messages in order.
How do you even know you have a voicemail? There are a few ways:
 A red circle showing the number of pending messages awaiting your
attention appears above the Phone icon on the Home screen, or above
the Voicemail icon from within the Phone application.
 You may also see a message on the iPhone display that says something
like, “New voicemail from Ed (or Bob).”
Whatever draws you in, tap that Voicemail icon to display the list of voice-
mails. You see the caller’s phone number, assuming this info is known
through CallerID, and in some cases his or her name. Or you see the 
word Unknown.
49
Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
Figure 4-3: A virtually familiar way 
to dial.

50
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Figure 4-4: Visual voicemail in action.
The beauty of all this, of course, is that you can ignore or at least put off lis-
tening to certain messages. We are not in the advice-giving business on what
calls you can safely avoid. In other words, ignore messages from the IRS or
your parole officer at your own risk.
A blue dot next to a name or number signifies that you haven’t heard the
message yet.
To play back a voicemail, tap the name or number in question. Then tap the
tiny play/pause button that shows up to the left. Tap once more to pause the
message; tap again to resume. Tap the Speaker button if you want to hear the
message through the iPhone’s speakerphone.
The tiny playhead along the scrubber bar (refer to Figure 4-4) shows you the
length of the message and how much of the message you’ve heard. If you
hate when callers ramble on forever, you can drag the playhead to rapidly
advance through a message. Perhaps more importantly, if you miss some-
thing, you can replay that segment.
Returning a call is as simple as tapping the green Call Back button. And you
can delete a voicemail by pressing Delete.

If you have no phone service, you’ll see a message that says Visual Voicemail
is currently unavailable.
You can listen to your iPhone voicemail from another phone. Just dial your
iPhone number and, while the greeting plays, enter your voicemail password.
You can set up such a password by tapping Settings from the Home screen
and then tapping Phone. Tap Change Voicemail Password. You’ll be asked 
to enter your current voicemail password, if you already have one. If one
doesn’t exist yet, tap Done. If it does exist, enter it and then tap Done. You’ll
then be asked to type the new password and tap Done, twice.
Recording a greeting
You have two choices when it comes to the voicemail greeting your callers
will hear. You can accept a generic greeting with your phone number by
default. Or you can create a custom greeting in your own voice. The steps:
1. Inside the voicemail application, tap the Greeting button.
2. Tap Custom.
3. Tap Record and start dictating a clever, deserving-of-being-on-the-
iPhone voicemail greeting. 
4. When you have finished recording, tap Stop.
5. Review the greeting by pressing Play. 
6. If the greeting is worthy, tap Save. If not, tap Cancel and start over at
Step 1.

Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
The globetrotting iPhone
Apple’s device is a quad-band GSM (850, 900,
1800, 1900 MHz) world phone. Before you break
into a sweat over the terminology, know that all
we’re really talking about is a phone you can use
to make calls while traveling abroad. You’ll have
to have AT&T turn on something called interna-
tional roaming. Contact AT&T for the latest
rates, which were fairly harsh at the time 
this book was being prepared. Go to www.wire
less.att.com/learn/international
for details.
If you’re calling the U.S. while overseas, you can
take advantage of International Assist. It’s a fea-
ture that automatically adds the proper prefix to
U.S. numbers dialed from abroad. Tap Settings,
Phone and then International Assist. Make sure
you see the blue On button instead of the white
Off button.
At least one company, Jajah, is providing a far
cheaper workaround for making international
calls from the U.S. (and elsewhere) with an
iPhone. Check out www.jajah.com for the
skinny.

52
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Receiving a Call
It’s wonderful to have numerous options for making a call. But what are your
choices when somebody calls you? The answer depends on whether you are
willing to take the call or not.
Accepting the call
To accept a call, you have three options:
 Tap Answer and greet the caller in whatever language makes sense.
 If the phone is locked, drag the slider to the right.
 If you are donning the stereo earbuds that come with the iPhone, click
the microphone button.
If you are listening to music in your iPhone’s iPod when a call comes in, the
song stops playing and you have to decide whether to take the call. If you do,
the music will resume from where you left off once the conversation ends.
Rejecting the call
We’re not going to assume that you are a cold-hearted person out to break a
caller’s heart. Rather, we assume that you are a busy person who will call
back at a more convenient time. 
Keeping that positive spin in mind, here are three ways to reject a call on the
spot and send the call to voicemail:
 Tap Decline. Couldn’t be easier than that.
 Press the Sleep/Wake button twice in rapid succession. (The button is
on the top of the device.)
 Using the supplied headset, press and hold the microphone button for a
couple of seconds and then let go. Two beeps let you know that the call
was indeed rejected.
Sometimes you’re perfectly willing to take a call but you need to silence the
ringer or turn off the vibration. To do so, press the Sleep/Wake button a
single time, or press one of the volume buttons. You’ll still have the opportu-
nity to answer.

Choosing ringtones
At the time this book was written, Apple included 25 ringtones in the iPhone,
ranging from the sound of crickets to an old car horn. To choose a ringtone:
1. From the Home screen, tap Settings.
2. Tap Sounds.
3. Tap Ringtone to access the list of avail-
able ringtones, shown in Figure 4-5.
4. Flick your finger to move up or down
the list.
5. Tap any of the ringtones to hear what
it will sound like.
A checkmark appears next to the ring-
tone you’ve just listened to.
6. If satisfied, you need do nothing more.
Unbeknownst to you, you have just
selected that ringtone. If not pleased,
try another.
You can easily assign specific ringtones to
individual callers. From Contacts, choose
the person to whom you want to designate a
particular ringtone. Tap Edit and then tap
Assign Ringtone. This displays the aforemen-
tioned list of ringtones. Choose the one that
seems most appropriate (a barking dog, say,
for your father-in-law).
To change or delete the ringtone for a specific person, go back into Contacts,
and tap Edit. Either tap the right arrow to choose a new ringtone for that
person or tap the red circle and Delete to remove the custom ringtone 
altogether.
53
Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
Figure 4-5: Ring my chimes: the
iPhone’s ringtones.
iTunes and ringtones
As of this writing, there is no way to turn the
music in your iTunes library into custom ring-
tones. The hurdles aren’t so much technical as
economic — cell phone carriers charge a lot for
ringtones — and it all boils down to who owns
the digital rights to the music you thought was
yours. You can buy ringtones from the iTunes
Store for 99 cents each, but you need to pay the
99 cents even if you’ve already purchased the
complete song. That doesn’t seem quite fair to
us, but that’s the way it works.

54
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
While on a Call
You can do lots of things while talking on an
iPhone, such as consulting your Calendar,
taking notes, or checking the weather. Tap
the Home button to get to these other appli-
cations. You’ve just witnessed the multitask-
ing marvel that is the iPhone.
If you’re using Wi-Fi, you can also surf the
Web (through Safari) while talking on the
phone. But you can’t if your only outlet to
cyberspace is the EDGE network.
Other options:
 Mute a call: From the main call screen
(shown in Figure 4-6) tap mute. Now you
need not mutter under your breath
when a caller ticks you off; they can’t
hear you. Tap mute again to un-mute the
sound.
 Tap contacts to display the Contacts
list.
 Place a call on hold: Again, pretty self-
explanatory. Just tap hold. Tap hold
again to take the person off hold. You
might put a caller on hold to answer another incoming call or to make 
a second call yourself. The next section deals with more than one call at
a time.
 Tap keypad to bring back the keypad: This is useful if you have to type
touch-tones to access another voicemail system or respond to an auto-
mated menu system. Heaven forbid you actually get a live person when
calling an insurance company or airline. But we digress . . .
 Use the speakerphone: Tap speaker to listen to a call through the
iPhone’s internal speakers without having to hold the device up to 
your mouth.
 Make a conference call: Read on.
Juggling calls
You can field a new call when you’re already talking to somebody. Or ignore it
(by tapping Ignore).
Figure 4-6: Managing calls.

To take the new call while keeping the first
caller on hold, tap the Hold Call + Answer
button that appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
You can then toggle between calls (placing
one or the other on hold) by tapping either
the Swap button or the first call at the top of
the screen.
If this is too much for you and that second
caller is really important, tap End Call +
Answer to ditch caller number one.
Merging calls
Now suppose caller number one and caller
number two know each other. Or you’d like
to play matchmaker so they get to know
each other. Tap Merge Calls so all three of
you can chitchat.
Conference calls
Now let’s assume you have to talk to your
whole sales team at once. It may be time to
initiate a conference call, which effectively
takes this merge call idea to its extreme. You
can merge up to five calls at a time. In fact, creating such a conference call on
the iPhone may be simpler than getting the same five people in a physical
room at the same time.
Here’s how you do it. Start by making a call and then placing the caller on
hold as noted in “Juggling calls.” Tap Add Call to make another call and then
Merge Calls to bring everybody together. Repeat this exercise to add the
other calls.
Other conference call tidbits:
 iPhone is actually a two-line phone, and one of the available lines can be
involved in a conference call.
 If you want to drop a call from a conference, tap Conference and then
tap the red circle with the little picture of the phone in it that appears
next to the call. Tap End Call to make that caller go bye-bye.
55
Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
Figure 4-7: Swapping calls.

56
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 You can speak privately with one of the callers in a conference. Tap
Conference, and then tap Private next to the caller you want to go hush-
hush with. Tap Merge Calls to bring the caller back into the Conference
so everyone can hear him or her.
 You can add a new incoming caller to an existing conference call by 
tapping Hold Call + Answer followed by Merge Calls.
There’s even more you can do with iPhone the phone. Check out Chapter 13
for extra phone tips. Meanwhile, we recommend that you read the next 
chapter to figure out how to become a whiz at text messaging.

Texting 1, 2, 3: SMS Messages 
and Notes
In This Chapter
 Sending and receiving SMS text messages
 Using the Notes application
T
here has never been a device like the iPhone, so chances are this is your
first experience with an intelligent virtual keyboard. In the beginning, it
will probably feel awkward. Within a few days, however, many iPhone users
report that they not only have become comfortable using it but have become
proficient virtual typists as well.
By the time you finish this chapter we think you’ll feel comfortable
and proficient, too. You discover all about using the virtual key-
board in Chapter 2. In this chapter we focus on two of the
iPhone applications that use text, namely Text (SMS) and
Notes. 
Texting
The Text application lets you exchange short text
messages with any cell phone that supports the SMS
protocol (which is almost all cell phones today).
SMS is the acronym for the Short Message Service pro-
tocol, often known as text messaging or just plain texting.
Typing text on a cell phone with a 12-key numeric keypad is an
unnatural act, which is why many people have never sent a single SMS 
text message. The iPhone will change that. The intelligent virtual keyboard makes
it easy to compose short text messages, and the big, bright, high-resolution
screen makes it a pleasure to read them.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
But before we get to the part where you send or receive SMS messages, let’s
go over some SMS basics:
 Both sender and receiver need SMS-enabled mobile phones. Your iPhone
qualifies, as does almost any mobile phone made in the past four or five
years. Keep in mind that if you send SMS messages to folks with a phone
that doesn’t support SMS, they will never get your message nor will they
know you even sent a message.
 Some phones (not the iPhone, of course) limit SMS messages to 160
characters. If you try to send a longer message to one of these phones,
your message may be truncated or split into multiple shorter messages.
The point is that it’s a good idea to keep SMS messages brief.
 Most iPhone plans include 200 SMS text messages per month. If you use
more than 200, you’ll be charged extra for each message over 200. 
Each individual message in a conversation counts against this total even
if it’s only a one-word reply such as “OK,” or “CUL8R” (which is teenager
for “see you later”).
 You can increase the number of SMS messages in your plan for a few
more dollars a month. This is almost always less expensive than paying
for them a la carte.
 You can send or receive SMS messages only over the AT&T network. 
Put another way, SMS messages can’t be sent or received over a Wi-Fi
connection.
Okay. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s start with how to send SMS
text messages.
You send me: Sending SMS text messages
Tap the Text (SMS) icon on the Home screen to launch the Text application,
and then tap the little pencil and paper icon in the top-right corner of the
screen to start a new text message.
At this point, the To field is active and awaiting your input. You could do
three things at this point:
 If the recipient isn’t in your Contacts list, type his or her cell phone
number.
 If the recipient is in your Contacts list, type the first few letters of the
name. A list of matching contacts appears. Scroll through it if necessary
and tap the name of the contact.

The more letters you type, the shorter the list becomes.
 Tap the blue plus icon on the right side of the To field to select a name
from your contact list.
There’s a fourth option if you want to compose the message first and address
it later. Tap the text entry field, which is just above the keyboard and to the
left of the Send button, and type your message. When you’ve finished typing,
you’ll need to tap the To field and use one of the preceding techniques to
address your message.
When you have finished addressing and composing, tap the Send button to
send your message on its merry way. And that’s all there is to it.
Being a golden receiver: Receiving 
SMS text messages
First things first. If you want to hear an alert sound when you receive an SMS
text message, tap the Settings icon on your Home screen, tap Sounds, and then
turn on the New Text Message item. (If you don’t want to hear an alert when 
an SMS message arrives, turn it off. ) Remember, though, that even if the New
Text Message option is turned on, you won’t hear any alert sound when an SMS
message arrives if the Ring/Silent switch is off.
Two things happen when you receive an SMS text message. First, when you
wake up your iPhone, all or part of the text will appear on the unlock screen.
Second, after you unlock the phone, the Text icon on the Home screen dis-
plays the number of unread messages.
To read your message, tap the Text icon and the Text Messages screen
appears. Tap the message to read it. If you want to reply to the message, tap
the text entry field to the left of the Send button, and the keyboard appears.
Type a reply and then tap Send.
Your conversation is saved as a series of text bubbles. Your messages appear
on the right side of the screen in green bubbles; the other person’s messages
appear on the left in gray bubbles, as shown in Figure 5-1.
You can delete a conversation in two ways :
 If you’re viewing the conversation: Tap the Clear button at the top right
of the conversation screen.
 If you’re viewing the list of text messages: Tap the Edit button at the
top left of the Text Messages list, and then tap the red minus icon that
appears next to the conversation.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Figure 5-1: This is what an SMS conversation looks like.
Smart SMS tricks
Here are some more things you can do with SMS text messages:
 To send an SMS text message to someone in your Favorites or Recents
list, tap the Phone icon on the Home screen, and then tap Favorites or
Recents, respectively. Tap the blue > icon to the right of a name or
number, and then tap Text Message at the bottom of the Info screen.
 To call or e-mail someone to whom you’ve sent an SMS text message, tap
the Text icon on the Home screen, and then tap the message in the Text
Messages list. Tap the Call button at the top of the conversation to call
the person, or tap the Contact Info button and then tap an e-mail
address to send an e-mail.
You can use this technique only if the contact has an e-mail address.
 To add someone to whom you’ve sent an SMS text message to your
Contacts list, tap their name or phone number in the Text Messages list
and then tap the Add to Contacts button.
Other person’s reply
Your message

 If an SMS message includes a URL, tap it to open that Web page in Safari.
 If an SMS message includes a phone number, tap it to call that number.
 If an SMS message includes an e-mail address, tap it to open a pre-
addressed e-mail message in Mail.
 If an SMS message includes a street address, tap it to see a map in Maps.
And that’s all there is to it. You are now an official SMS text message maven.
Take Note of Notes
Notes is an application that creates text notes that you can save or send
through e-mail. To create a note, first tap the Notes icon on the Home screen,
and then tap the plus button in the top-right
corner to start a new note. The virtual 
keyboard appears. Type the note. When
you’re finished, tap the Done button in 
the top-right corner to save the note. See
Figure 5-2.
After a note is saved, you can do the 
following:
 Tap the Notes button at the top-left
corner of the screen to see a list of all
your notes. When the list is onscreen,
just tap a note to open and view it.
 Tap the left or right arrow button at
the bottom of the screen to read the
previous or next note.
 Tap the letter button at the bottom of
the screen to e-mail the note to some-
one with the Mail application (see
Chapter 11).
 Tap the trash can button at the bottom
of the screen to delete the note.
And that’s all there is to it. You now know
all there is to know about creating and 
managing notes with Notes.

Calendars and Calculators 
and Clocks, Oh My
In This Chapter
 Understanding the calendar’s different views
 Calculating with your iPhone
 Using the clock as an alarm, a stopwatch, and a timer too
T
he iPhone is a smartphone. And as a smart device it can remind you of
appointments, tell you the time where you live or halfway around the
world, and even solve simple arithmetic.
Over the next few pages we’ll take a look at three of the iPhone’s core — if
frankly unsexy — applications. Indeed, we’d venture to say none
of you actually bought an iPhone because of its calendar, cal-
culator, or clock. Just the same, it’s awfully handy having
these programs around.
Working with the Calendar
The Calendar program lets you keep on top of your
appointments and events (birthdays, anniversaries,
and the like). You get there by tapping the Calendar
icon on the Home screen. The icon is pretty smart in
its own right because it changes daily; the day of the
week and date are displayed.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
You have three main ways to peek at your calendar: List, Day, and Month
views. Choosing one is as simple as tapping on the List, Day, or Month button
at the top of the Calendar screen. From each view, you can always return to
the current day by tapping the Today button.
A closer look . . .
List view
Nothing complicated with the List view. As
the name indicates, the List view, shown in
Figure 6-1, presents current and future
appointments in a list format. You can drag
the list up or down with your finger. Or flick
to rapidly scroll through the list. The List
view pretty much compensates for the lack
of a week-at-a-glance view, though Apple
could certainly add such a feature, perhaps
even by the time you read this book.
Frankly, we’d have loved for Apple to
include multiple calendars, rather than just
the single one here. A to-do list function
would have also been nice. (Hey, nothing
wrong with wanting more; in fact we devote
Chapter 16 to our wish list.) You have our
permission to lobby the gang in Cupertino.
If you’re a Mac user who uses iCal, only
part of this applies. You can create multiple
calendars in iCal and choose which ones to
sync with your phone (as described in
Chapter 3). 
But be careful: To-do items created in iCal are
not synced and won’t appear on your iPhone. And even more unfortunately, all
events from all of your iCal calendars show up on the single iPhone calendar
after a sync.
Figure 6-1: The List view.

Day view
The Day view, shown in Figure 6-2, reveals the appointments of a given 
24-hour period (though you’ll have to scroll up or down to see an entire 
day’s worth of entries).
Month view
By now you’re getting the hang of this. In Month view you can see appoint-
ments from January to December. In this monthly calendar view, you’ll see a
dot on any day that has appointments or events. Tap that day to see the list
of activities that the dot represents. It’s just below the month in view, as
shown in Figure 6-3.

Adding Calendar Entries
In Chapter 3 you discover pretty much everything there is to know about
syncing your iPhone. And that includes syncing calendar entries from your
Windows machine (via the likes of Microsoft Outlook) or Mac (via iCal or
Microsoft Entourage).
Of course, in plenty of situations you’ll want to enter appointments on-the-fly.
It’s very easy to add appointments directly to the iPhone:
1. Tap the Calendar icon at the top of
the screen, and then tap the List, Day,
or Month button.
2. Tap the + button at the upper-right
corner of the screen.
The + appears whether you are in 
List, Day, or Month view. Tapping + dis-
plays the Add Event screen, shown in
Figure 6-4.
3. Tap the Title/Location field and
finger-type as much or as little infor-
mation as you feel is necessary.
Tapping displays the virtual keyboard.
4. Tap Save.
5. If your calendar entry has a start time
or end time (or both):
a. Tap the Starts/Ends field.
b. In the bottom half of the screen 
that appears (Figure 6-5), choose 
the time the event starts and
then the time it ends.
Use your finger to roll separate
wheels for the date, hour, minute (in 5-minute intervals), and AM
or PM. It’s a little like manipulating one of those combination 
bicycle locks.
c. Tap Save when you are finished.
Figure 6-4: You are about to add an
event to your iPhone.

6. If you are entering a birthday or
another all-day milestone, tap the All-
day button so that On (rather than
Off) is showing. Then tap Save.
Since the time isn’t relevant for an all-
day entry, you’ll note that the bottom
half of the screen now has wheels for
just the month, day, and year.
7. If you are setting up a recurring
entry, such as an anniversary, tap the
Repeat window. Tap to indicate how
often the event in question recurs,
and then tap Save.
The options are Every Day, Every
Week, Every 2 Weeks, Every Month,
Every Year.
8. If you want to set a reminder or alert
for the entry, tap Alert. Then tap on a
time, and then tap Save.
Alerts can be set to arrive on the actual
date of an event, 2 days before, 1 day
before, 2 hours before, 1 hour before, 30
minutes before, 15 minutes before, or 5
minutes before. At Alert time, you’ll
hear a sound and see a message like the
one shown in Figure 6-6.
Are you the kind of person who
needs an extra nudge? You can
set another reminder by tapping
on the Second Alert field.
9. If you want to enter notes about
the appointment or event, tap
Notes. Type your note, and then
tap Save.
A virtual keyboard pops up so you can type in those notes.
10. Tap Done when you have finished entering everything.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
You can turn off a calendar alert by tapping Settings, tapping Sounds, and
then making sure the Calendar Alerts button is turned Off.
And if you want to modify an existing calendar entry, tap the entry, tap Edit,
and then make whatever changes need to be made. To wipe out a calendar
entry, tap Edit and then tap Delete Event. You’ll get a chance to tap Cancel in
case you tapped Delete Event by mistake.
Finally, calendar entries you create on your iPhone are synchronized with the
calendar you specified in the iTunes Info pane.
Calculate This
Quick, what’s 3467.8 times 982.3? Why the answer of course is 3406419.94.
We can solve the problem thanks to the iPhone’s calculator, buried (until
needed) under another of those Sweet Sixteen Home screen icons. Truth is,
it’s not the most advanced calculator you’ll ever use. Go elsewhere for a sine
or a square root. But for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, the
iPhone calculator does just fine. Numbers and symbols (such as C for clear,
and M+ for memory) are large and easy to see.
It’s nice to know a smartphone can make you feel so much smarter.
Punching the Clock
We know what you must be thinking. “So the iPhone has a clock. Big deal.
Doesn’t every cell phone have a clock?”
Well, yes, every cell phone does have a clock. But not every phone has a
“world clock” that lets you display the time in multiple cities on multiple con-
tinents. And not every cell phone has an alarm, a stopwatch, and a timer to
boot.
Let’s glance at those functions on your iPhone.
World clock
Want to know the time in Beijing or Bogota? Tapping on World Clock (inside
the Clock application) lets you display the time in numerous cities around
the globe, as shown in Figure 6-7.

Tap the + symbol at the upper-right corner
of the screen and start typing a city name
with the virtual keyboard. The moment you
type the first letter, in fact, the iPhone dis-
plays a list of cities or countries that begin
with that letter. So typing V will bring up
both Vancouver, Canada and Caracas,
Venezuela, among myriad other possibili-
ties. You can create clocks for as many
cities as you like, though the times in only
four cities appear in a single screen. To see
times in other cities, scroll up or down.
To remove a city from the list, tap Edit, and
then tap the red circle with the white hori-
zontal line in it to the left of the city you
want to drop. Then tap Delete.
You can also rearrange the order of the
cities displaying the time. Press your finger
against the symbol with three horizontal
lines to the right of the city you want to
move up or down in the list and then drag
it to its new spot.
Alarm clock
Ever try and set the alarm in a hotel room? It’s remarkable how complicated
setting an alarm can be on even the most inexpensive clock radio. As with
most things, the procedure is dirt simple on the iPhone:
1. Tap Clock on the Home screen to display the Clock application.
2. Tap the Alarm icon at the bottom of the screen.
3. Tap the + sign at the upper-right corner of the screen.
4. Choose the time of the alarm by rotating the wheel on the bottom half
of the screen.
This is similar to the action required to setting the time an event starts
or ends in your calendar.
5. If you want the alarm to go off on other days, tap Repeat and tell the
iPhone the days you want the alarm to be repeated.
69

Budapest?

6. Tap Sound to choose the ringtone (see Chapter 4) that will wake 
you up.
This is a matter of personal preference, but we can tell you that the ring-
tone with the appropriate name Alarm managed to wake Ed out of a
deep sleep.
7. Tap Snooze to have the alarm appear on the screen accompanied by a
Snooze button.
Tap the Snooze button to shut up the alarm for 10 minutes.
8. If you want to call the alarm something other than, um, Alarm, tap the
Label field and use the virtual keyboard to type another descriptor.
9. Tap Save when the alarm settings are to your liking.
You’ll know an alarm has been set and activated thanks to the tiny status
icon — surprise, surprise, it looks like a clock — that appears in the upper-
right corner of the screen.
An alarm will take precedence over any tracks you are listening to on the
iPod. So songs will momentarily pause when an alarm goes off and resume
when you turn off the alarm (or press the Snooze button).
Seems obvious, but to hear an alarm, make sure your iPhone’s volume is
turned up.
Stopwatch
If you’re helping a loved one train for a marathon, your iPhone’s Stopwatch
function can provide an assist. It’s accessible by tapping Stopwatch in the
Clock application.
Just tap Start to begin the count and tap Stop at the finish line. You can also
tap a Lap button to monitor the times between laps.
Timer
Cooking a hard-boiled egg or Thanksgiving turkey? Again, the iPhone comes
to the rescue. Tap Timer (within the Clock app) and then rotate the hour and
minute wheels until the time you have in mind is highlighted. Tap When
Timer Ends to choose the ringtone that will signify that time’s up.

After you’ve set up the length of the timer, tap Start when you’re ready to
begin. You can watch the minutes and seconds wind down on the screen if
you have nothing better to do.
But you if you’re doing anything else on the iPhone — admiring photos, 
say — you’ll hear the ringtone and see a Timer Done message on the screen
at the appropriate moment. Tap OK to silence the ringtone.
Now it’s time to move on to the stuff that makes the iPhone really sexy.

Part III
The Multimedia
iPhone

Your iPhone is arguably the best iPod ever
invented. So in this part we look at the multi-
media side of your phone — audio, video, and still
pictures, too. There has never been a phone that
was this much fun to use; in this part we show you
how to wring the most fun out of every multimedia
bit of it.
First we explore how to enjoy listening to music,
podcasts, and audiobooks on your iPhone. Then
we look at some video, both literally and ﬁgura-
tively. We start off with a quick segment about
how to ﬁnd good video for your iPhone. We follow
that with instructions for watching video on your
iPhone. 
Before we leave the video scene, you also see how
to have a blast with video from the infamous
YouTube Web site using iPhone’s built-in YouTube
application. We wrap this multimedia part up with
everything you always wanted to know about
photos and iPhones: how to shoot photos well,
how to store them, how to sync them, and how to
do all kinds of other interesting things with them.

on Your iPhone
In This Chapter
 Introducing the iPod inside your iPhone
 Taking control of your tunes
 Customizing your audio experience
A
s we mentioned elsewhere, your iPhone is also one heck of an iPod with
video. In this chapter we show you how to use your iPhone for audio; in
Chapter 8 we cover video.
We start with a quick tour of the iPhone’s iPod application. Then we look at
how to use your iPhone as an audio player. After you’re nice and
comfy with using it this way, we show you how to customize
the listening experience so it’s just the way you like it.
Finally, we offer a few tips that will help you get the most
out of using your iPhone as an audio player.
We’re going to assume that you’ve synced your
iPhone with your computer and that your iPhone
contains audio content — songs, podcasts, or audio-
books. If you don’t have any audio on your iPhone
yet, we humbly suggest that you get some (flip back
to Chapter 3 and follow the instructions) before you
read the rest of this chapter — or the next chapter for
that matter.
Okay, now that you have some audio content on your 
iPhone to play with, are you ready to rock?

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Introducing the iPod inside Your iPhone
To use your iPhone as an iPod, just tap the iPod icon in the bottom-right
corner of the Home screen. At the bottom of the screen that appears, you
should see five icons: Playlists, Artists, Songs, Video, and More.
If you don’t see these icons, tap the Back button in the top-left corner of the
screen (the one that looks like a little arrow pointing to the left).
Or, if you’re holding your iPhone sideways (the long edges parallel to the
ground), rotate it 90 degrees so it’s upright (the short edges parallel to the
ground).
You’ll understand why your iPhone’s orientation matters when you read the
section on Cover Flow, which is coming up in a few pages.
Playing with playlists
Tap the Playlists icon at the bottom of the screen and a list of playlists
appears. If you don’t have any playlists on your iPhone, don’t sweat. Just
know that if you had some, this is where they’d be. (Playlists let you organize
songs around a particular theme or mood: opera arias, romantic ballads,
British invasion, whatever.)
Tap a playlist and you see a list of the songs it contains. If the list is longer
than one screen, flick upwards to scroll down. Tap a song in the list and it
plays.
And that’s all there is to selecting and playing a song from a playlist.
Artistic license
Now let’s find and play a song by the artist’s name instead of by playlist. Tap
the Artists icon at the bottom of the screen and a list of artists appears.
Tap an artist’s name and a list of songs by that artist appears. If the list is
longer than one screen, flick upwards to scroll down. Tap a song in this list
and it plays.
Are you starting to see a pattern here?

Song selection
Finally, let’s find a song by its title and play it. Tap the Songs icon at the
bottom of the screen and a list of songs appears.
Now chances are your list of songs is quite a bit longer than your lists of
playlists and artists. So in addition to flicking upwards to scroll down, you
can tap a letter on the right side of the screen to jump to songs that start
with that letter. In Figure 7-1, for example, that letter is T.
Figure 7-1: Tap the T on the right side of the 
screen to jump to song titles that begin with T.
Taking Control of Your Tunes
Now that you have the basics down, let’s look at some of the other things you
can do when your iPhone is in its iPod mode.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Go with the (cover) flow
Finding tracks by playlist, artist, or song is cool, but finding them with Cover
Flow is even cooler. Cover Flow lets you browse your music collection by its
album artwork. To
use Cover Flow, turn
your iPhone sideways
(that is, long edges
parallel to the
ground). As long as
you’re not browsing
or viewing video
(and, of course,
you’ve tapped the
iPod icon on the
Home screen so your
iPhone behaves like
an iPod), Cover Flow
fills the screen, as
shown in Figure 7-2.
It’s simple to scan your cover art in Cover Flow. All you have to do is drag or
flick your finger left or right on the screen and the covers go flying by. Flick or
drag quickly and the covers whiz by; flick or drag slowly and the covers
move leisurely. Or tap a particular cover on the left or right of the current
(centered) cover and that cover jumps to the center.
Try it, you’ll like it! Now here’s how to put Cover Flow to work for you:
 To see the tracks (songs) on an album, tap the cover when it’s centered
or tap the info button (the little i) in the lower-right corner of the screen.
The track list appears.
 To play a track, tap its name in the list. If the list is long, scroll by drag-
ging or flicking up and down on it.
 To go back to Cover Flow, tap the title bar at the top of the track list or
tap the little i button again.
 To play or pause the current song, tap the play/pause button in the
lower-left corner.
If no cover art exists for an album in your collection, the iPhone displays a
plain-looking cover decorated with musical notes. The name of the album
appears below this generic cover.
Figure 7-2: Go with the Cover Flow.

And that, friends, is all there is to the iPhone’s cool Cover Flow mode.
Flow’s not here right now
As you saw earlier in
the chapter, when
you hold your iPhone
vertically (the short
edges parallel to the
ground) and tap the
Playlists, Artists, or
Songs button, you see
a list instead of Cover
Flow.
The controls are 
different depending
on which way you
hold your iPhone as
well. When you hold
your iPhone vertically,
as shown in Figure 7-3,
you see controls that
don’t appear when
you hold your
iPhone sideways.
And furthermore,
the controls you see when viewing the Playlists, Artists, or Songs lists are
slightly different than the controls you see when a song is playing.
Here’s how to use the controls that appear when the iPhone is vertical :
 Back button: Tap this to return to whichever list you used last —
Playlists, Artists, or Songs.
 Switch to track list button: Tap this to switch to a list of tracks.
If you don’t see the next three controls — the repeat button, the scrub-
ber, and the shuffle button — tap the album cover once to make them
appear.
 Repeat button: Tap once to repeat songs in the current album or list.
The button turns blue. Tap it again to repeat the current song over and
over again; the blue button displays the number 1 when it’s in this
mode. Tap it again to turn it off. The button goes back to its original
color, gray.

 Scrubber bar: Drag the little dot (the playhead) along the scrubber bar
to skip to any point within the song.
 Shuffle button: Tap once to shuffle songs and play them in random order.
The button turns blue when shuffling is enabled. Tap it again to play
songs in order again. The button goes back to its original color, gray.
You can also shuffle tracks in any list of songs — such as playlists or
albums — by tapping the word Shuffle, which appears at the top of the
list. Regardless of whether the shuffle button has been tapped, this tech-
nique always plays songs in that list in random order.
 Restart/previous track/rewind button: Tap this once to go to the begin-
ning of the track. Tap it twice to go to the start of the previous track in
the list. Touch and hold it to rewind through the song at double speed.
 Play/pause button: Tap this to play or pause the song.
 Next track/fast-forward button: Tap this to skip to the next track in the
list. Touch and hold it to fast forward through the song at double speed.
 Volume control: Drag the little dot left or right to reduce or increase the
volume level.
If you’re using the headset included with your iPhone, you can squeeze the
mic to pause, and squeeze it again to play. You can also squeeze it twice in
rapid succession to skip to the next song. Sweet!
When you tap the switch to
track list button, the iPhone
screen and the controls
change, as shown in Figure
7-4. And here’s how to use
those controls:
 Switch to now playing
button: Tap this to
switch to the Now
Playing screen for the
current track (refer to
Figure 7-3).
 Rating bar: Drag across
the rating bar to rate
the current track with
zero to five stars. The
track shown in Figure
7-4 has a four-star
rating.
Switch to

Figure 7-4: Tap the switch to track list button and these

The tracks are the songs in the current list (album, playlist, artist, and so on)
and the current track indicator shows you which song is currently playing (or
paused). Tap any song in a track list to play it.
And that, friends, is pretty much all you need to know to enjoy listening to
music (and podcasts and audiobooks, too) on your iPhone.
Customizing Your Audio Experience
We should cover a few more things before you move on to the video side of
your iPhone-as-an-iPod in Chapter 8. In this section you find a bunch of stuff
you can do to make your listening experience even better.
If you still want more . . .
If you’d prefer to browse through your audio collection by criteria other 
than playlists, artists, or songs, there is a way. That way is to tap the More
button at the bottom-right corner of the screen. The More list appears. Tap 
a choice in the list — albums, audiobooks, compilations, composers, genres,
or podcasts — and your audio collection is organized by your criterion.
But wait, there’s more. You can swap out the Playlists, Artists, Songs, and
Video buttons for ones that better suit your needs. So, for example, if you
listen to a lot of podcasts and never watch video, you can replace the Video
button with a Podcasts button.
Here’s how:
1. Tap the More button at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
2. Tap the Edit button at the top-left corner of the screen.
3. Drag any button on the screen — Albums, Podcasts, Audiobooks,
Genres, Composers, Compilations — onto the button at the bottom of
the screen that you want it to replace.
4. You can also rearrange the five buttons now by dragging them to the
left or right.
5. When everything is just the way you like it, tap the Done button to
return to the More list.
You can always browse your audio collection by buttons you replace this way
by tapping the More button and choosing the item that corresponds to the
button you replaced in the More list.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Setting preferences
You can change a few preference settings to customize your iPhone-as-an-
iPod experience.
Play all songs at the same volume level
iTunes has an option called Sound Check that automatically adjusts the level
of songs so they play at the same volume relative to each other. That way,
one song never blasts out your ears even if the recording is much louder than
the song before or after it. To tell the iPhone to use these volume settings,
you first have to turn on the feature in iTunes on your computer. Here’s how
to do that:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (PC).
2. Click the Playback tab.
3. Select the Sound Check check box to enable it.
Now you need to tell the iPhone to use the Sound Check settings from iTunes.
Here’s how to do that:
1. Tap the Settings icon on the iPhone’s Home screen.
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
3. Tap Sound Check to turn it on.
Set the audiobook playing speed
You can make audiobooks play a bit faster or slower than usual if you like. To
do so:
1. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
3. Tap Audiobook in the list of iPod settings.
4. Tap Slower of Faster to slow down or speed up audiobook playback.
Choose an equalizer setting
An equalizer increases or decreases the relative levels of specific frequencies
to enhance the sound you hear. Some equalizer settings emphasize the bass
notes (low end) in a song; other equalizer settings make the higher frequen-
cies more apparent. The iPhone has more than a dozen equalizer presets,
with names such as Acoustic, Bass Booster, Bass Reducer, Dance, Electronic,
Pop, and Rock. Each one is ostensibly tailored to a specific type of music.

The way to find out whether you prefer using equalization is to listen to
music while trying out different settings. To do that, first start listening to a
song you like. Then, while the song is playing:
1. Tap the Home button on the front of your iPhone.
2. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
3. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
4. Tap EQ in the list of iPod settings.
5. Tap different EQ presets (Pop, Rock, R&B, Dance, and so on) and
listen carefully to the way it changes how the song sounds.
6. When you find an equalizer preset you think sounds good, tap the
Home button and you’re finished.
If you don’t like any of the presets, tap Off at the top of the EQ list to turn off
the equalizer.
If you’ve set an equalizer preset for a song using the Track Info window in
iTunes, that setting is applied automatically to the song when you sync it to
your iPhone. That’s pretty cool.
Set a volume limit for music (and videos)
You can instruct your iPhone to limit the loudest listening level for audio or
video. To do so:
1. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
3. Tap Volume Limit in the list of iPod settings.
4. Drag the slider to adjust the maximum volume level to your liking.
5. (Optional) Tap Lock Volume Limit to assign a four-digit passcode to
this setting so others can’t easily change it.
The Volume Limit setting only limits the volume of music and videos. It 
doesn’t apply to podcasts or audiobooks. And although it does work with 
any headset, headphones, or speakers plugged into the headset jack on 
your iPhone, it does not affect sound played through your iPhone’s internal
speaker.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Make a playlist on your iPhone
Of course you can make playlists in iTunes and sync them with your iPhone,
but you can also create playlists on your iPhone when you’re out and about.
Here’s how:
1. Tap the iPod icon in the bottom-right corner of the Home screen.
2. Tap the Playlists button at the bottom of the screen.
3. Tap the first item in the list, On-the-Go.
An alphabetical list of all the songs on your iPhone appears. To the right
of each song is a little plus sign.
4. Tap the plus sign next to a song name to add the song to your On-the-
Go playlist.
To add all of these songs to your On-the-Go playlist, tap the plus sign
next to the first item in the list, Add All Songs.
5. Tap the Done button in the top-right corner.
If you create an On-the-Go playlist and then sync your iPhone with your com-
puter, that playlist will be saved both on the iPhone and in iTunes on your
computer. The first time you save one it will be named On-the-Go 1 automati-
cally. Subsequent lists you create will be auto-named On-the-Go 2, On-the-Go 3,
and so on.
The playlists remain until you delete them from iTunes. To do that, select the
playlist’s name in the source list and then press Delete or Backspace.
You can also edit your On-the-Go playlist. To do so, first tap the Playlists
button at the bottom of the screen, tap the first item in the list, On-the-Go,
and tap the Edit button. Then:
 To move a song up or down in the On-the-Go playlist: A little icon with
three gray bars appears to the right of each song. Drag the icon up to
move the song higher in the list or down to move the song lower in 
the list.
 To add more songs to the On-the-Go playlist: Tap the plus button in the
top-left corner.
 To delete a song from the On-the-Go playlist: Tap the minus sign to the
left of the song name. Note that deleting a song from the On-the-Go
playlist doesn’t remove the song from your iPhone.
 To clear the On-the-Go playlist of all songs: Tap the first item in the list,
Clear Playlist.

When you’ve finished editing, tap the Done button in the top-right corner.
And that’s all there is to creating and managing On-the-Go playlists.
Set a sleep timer
If you like to fall asleep with music playing but don’t want to leave your
iPhone playing music all night long, you can turn on its sleep timer.
Here’s how:
1. Tap the Clock button on the Home screen.
2. Tap the Timer icon in the lower-right corner.
3. Set the number of hours and minutes you want the iPhone to play,
and then tap the When Timer Ends button.
4. Tap the first item in the list, Sleep iPod.
5. Tap the Set button in the top-right corner.
6. Tap the big green Start button.
That’s it! After the appropriate period of time your iPod will stop playing and
your iPhone will go to sleep.

ning. And all eyes are fixed on the iPhone.
Okay, here comes the reality check. The iPhone is not going to replace a 
wall-sized high-definition television as the centerpiece of your home theater.
But we do want to emphasize that with its glorious widescreen 31⁄2-inch 
display — the best we’ve seen on a handheld device — watching
movies and other videos on the iPhone can be a cinematic
delight.
Let’s get on with the show!
Finding Stuff to Watch
The video you’ll watch on the iPhone generally falls
into one of four categories:
 Movies, TV shows, and music videos that reside
in iTunes software on your PC or Mac that you
synchronize with your iPhone. (For more on syn-
chronization, refer to Chapter 3.) You can watch these 
by tapping the iPod icon at the bottom of the Home screen
and then tapping Videos.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Apple’s own iTunes Store features dedicated sections for purchasing
episodes of TV shows (from The Larry Sanders Show to Teletubbies) and
movies (such as Finding Nemo or The Queen). Typical price as of this
writing are $1.99 per episode for TV shows and $9.99 for feature films.
 The boatload of video podcasts, just about all of them free, featured in
the iTunes Store. Podcasts started out as another form of Internet radio,
though instead of listening to live streams you downloaded files onto
your computer to take in at your leisure. There are still lots of audio
podcasts, but the focus here is on video.
 Homegrown videos from the popular YouTube Internet site. Apple
obviously thinks highly of YouTube because it devoted a dedicated
Home screen icon to the site. More on YouTube’s special place in the
iPhone later in this chapter.
 The movies you’ve created in iMovie software on the Mac or other
programs on the PC. Plus all the other videos you may have down-
loaded from the Internet.
Are we compatible?
Sidebars in this book are considered optional
reading, but we secretly hope you’ll digest every
word because you may discover something or
be entertained or both. But you can safely skip
the material contained herein, no matter how
much you want to curry favor with your teach-
ers, um, authors.
Still, we present this list of video formats sup-
ported by the iPhone as a courtesy to those with
geek aspirations (you know who you are). And
just to point out how absurd the world of tech can
sound sometimes — even from a consumer-
friendly company such as Apple — we are lifting
this passage from Apple’s Web site verbatim:
Video formats supported: H.264 video, up to 1.5
Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second,
Low-Complexity version of the H.264 Baseline
Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz,
stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats;
H.264 video, up to 768 Kbps, 320 by 240 pixels, 30
frames per second, Baseline Profile up to Level
1.3 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz,
stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats;
MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels,
30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-
LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in
.m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats
Got all that? Here’s the takeaway message: The
iPhone works with a whole bunch of video,
though not everything you’ll want to watch will
make it through. And you may not know if it will
play until you try. Indeed, several Internet video
standards, notably Adobe Flash, Java, Real, and
Windows Media Video, were not supported
when this book was in production. (This may
have changed by the time you read this.)
However, if something doesn’t play now it may
well in the future because Apple has the ability
to upgrade the iPhone through software.

You may have to prepare these videos so that they’ll play on your iPhone. To
do so, highlight the video in question after it resides in your iTunes library.
Go to the Advanced menu in iTunes, and click Convert Selection for iPod.
For more on compatibility, check out the “Are we compatible?” sidebar 
(but read it at your own risk).
Playing Video
Now that you know what you want to watch, here’s how to watch it:
1. On the Home screen, tap the iPod
icon and then tap the Videos icon.
Your list of videos pops up. As shown
in Figure 8-1, videos are segregated by
category (Movies, TV Shows, Music
Videos, Podcasts) and accompanied
by thumbnail images and the length of
the video.
2. Flick your finger to scroll through the
list, and then tap the video you want
to play. You’ll see a spinning circle
for just a moment and then the video
will begin.
3. Turn the device to its side because
the iPhone plays video only in land-
scape, or widescreen, mode.
For movies, this is a great thing. You
can watch flicks as the filmmaker
intended, in a cinematic aspect ratio.
4. Now that the video is playing, tap the
screen to display the controls shown
in Figure 8-2.
5. Tap the controls that follow as
needed:
• To play or pause the video, tap the play/pause button.
• Drag the volume slider to the right to raise the volume and to the
left to lower it. Alternatively, use the physical Volume buttons to
control the audio levels. If the video is oriented properly, the but-
tons will be to the bottom left of the iPhone.

watch.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Figure 8-2: Controlling the video.
• Tap the restart/rewind button to restart the video or tap and hold
the same button to rewind.
• Tap and hold the fast-forward button to advance the video. 
You can skip ahead also by dragging the playhead along the 
scrubber bar.
• Tap the scale button to toggle between filling the entire screen
with video or fitting the video to the screen. Alternatively, you can
double-tap the video to go back and forth between fitting and fill-
ing the screen.
Here’s the distinction between fitting and filling. Fitting the video
to the screen displays the film in its theatrical aspect ratio. But you
may see black bars above or below the video (or to its sides),
which some people don’t like. On the other hand, filling the entire
screen with the video may crop or trim the sides or top of the pic-
ture, so you aren’t seeing the complete scene that the director
shot.
6. Tap the screen again to make the controls go away (or just wait for
them to go away on their own).
7. Tap Done when you’ve finished watching (you’ll have to summon the
controls back if they’re not already present).
You return to the iPhone’s video menu screen.

If you make it to the end of a movie or other video — so did the butler do it,
or what? — the iPhone generously offers to delete the film to free up space,
as shown in Figure 8-3. Tap Keep or Delete depending on your preference. If
you tap Delete, the iPhone will ask whether you’re sure. Don’t sweat it. If you
ever change your mind, just sync the movie again from iTunes.
Figure 8-3: Making room for the next flick.
To manually delete a video, swipe left or right over the video listing. Then tap
the small red Delete button that materializes. To confirm your intention, tap
the larger Delete button that appears.
Sometimes you want to hear a song from a music video but don’t want to
watch it. Instead of tapping the Videos icon to grab that selection, choose the
ditty by tapping the Songs or Artists icon instead.
Hey You, It’s YouTube
YouTube has come to define video sharing on the Internet. The wildly popu-
lar site, now owned by Google, has become so powerful that American presi-
dential hopefuls and even politicians in other countries campaign and hold
debates there. As you might imagine, YouTube has also generated contro-
versy. The site has been banned in some foreign countries. And Viacom sued
YouTube for more than $1 billion over alleged copyright infringements. (We’ll
leave that fight to the lawyers.)
All the while, of course, YouTube staked a humongous claim on mainstream
culture. That’s because YouTube is, well, about you and us and our pets and
so on. It is the cyberdestination, as YouTube boldly proclaims, to “Broadcast
Yourself.”

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Apple has afforded YouTube its own cherished icon on the Home screen. The
company announced that more than 10,000 YouTube streaming videos were
available on the iPhone at the time of its end-of-June 2007 launch, with the
full catalog promised by the fall of 2007.
Why the delay? The back catalog of YouTube videos are being converted to
the H.264 video compression standard that the iPhone (and another Apple
product called Apple TV) can recognize.
As with other videos, you can tap the screen when a YouTube video plays to
bring up hidden video controls. Many of these controls are identical to the
controls in Figure 8-2. But as Figure 8-4 shows, YouTube displays special con-
trols of its own, notably for adding bookmarks and sending e-mail links of the
video you’re watching.
Figure 8-4: YouTube video controls.
Hunting for YouTube gems
So where exactly do YouTubers find the videos that will offer them a blissful,
albeit brief, respite from the rest of their day? By tapping on any of the 
following:
 Featured: Videos recommended by YouTube’s own staffers.
 Most Viewed: What the YouTube community is watching. Tap All to see
the most watched YouTube videos of all time. Tap Today or This Week to
check out the videos most currently in vogue.
Bookmark
E-mail

 Bookmarks: After stumbling on a video
you like, bookmark it by tapping the
Bookmark control.
 Search: Tap the Search icon, and then
tap the blank YouTube search field at
the top of the screen. Up pops one of
the iPhone’s virtual keyboards. Type a
search phrase and then tap the Search
button to generate results. (In Figure
8-5, we typed Steve Jobs.)
 More: Tapping More leads to more but-
tons or icons. As in those that follow . . .
 Most Recent: Newly submitted videos.
 Top Rated: The people’s choice.
YouTube’s audience chooses the best.
 History: Videos you recently viewed.
Only four YouTube icons (besides the More
button) appear at the bottom of the screen
at any one time. But say you are more likely
to tap the Top Rated icon rather than the
Bookmarks icon to get to videos you want
to check out. Rather than having to tap
More each time you want to tap Top Rated,
you can make it one of your Fab Four icons.
To change the icons shown on that first YouTube screen, tap More and then
tap Edit. Then simply drag your preferred icon (Top Rated in this example)
over the one you want to relegate to the YouTube bench (Bookmarks in this
case). You can also rearrange the order of the icons by dragging them left or
right.
While the movie you’ve selected is downloading — and how fast it arrives
depends on your network coverage from AT&T or Wi-Fi, as discussed in
greater detail in Chapter 10 — you see a black-and-grey screen with video
controls and the YouTube logo. This screen is shown in Figure 8-6. The con-
trols disappear once the movie starts playing.

Sharing YouTube videos
We were as enthralled as that harshest of critics Simon Cowell was by 
Paul Potts, the British mobile phone worker turned opera singer. His star turn
on the American Idol-like Britain’s Got Talent has been immortalized on
YouTube by millions.
You can share such a video as you are watching it, by tapping the e-mail
button (refer to Figure 8-4). When you do so, one of the iPhone’s virtual key-
boards pops up. iPhone has already filled in the e-mail subject line with the
name of the video. And the body of the message is populated with a link to
the video on YouTube. All you need to do is fill in the To field with the e-mail
address of the person you are sending the link to along with any additional
comments.
Alternatively, from the list of videos, tap the blue button with the right-
pointing arrow to see all sorts of details on a particular video. You’ll see a
description of the video, the number of people who viewed it, the date it was
added, and other information. From there, tap the Share button to bring up
the e-mail program described in the preceding paragraph.
With that, let’s roll the closing credits to this chapter.

amera phones may outsell dedicated digital cameras nowadays, but
with relatively few exceptions, they’re rather mediocre picture takers.
Come to think of it, most mobile phones don’t show off digital images all
that well either.
Of course, most mobile phones aren’t iPhones.
The device you have recently purchased (or are lust-
ing after) is a pretty spectacular photo viewer. And
though its built-in digital camera isn’t the one we’d
rely on for snapping pictures during an African
safari, say, or even Junior’s fast-paced soccer game,
the iPhone in your steady hands can produce per-
fectly acceptable photos.
Over the next few pages, you discover how best to
exploit the iPhone’s camera. We then move on to the
real magic — making the digital photos that reside on the
iPhone come alive — whether you imported them from your
computer or captured them with the iPhone’s camera.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Taking Your Best Shot
Like many applications on the iPhone, you’ll find the Camera application icon
on the Home screen. It’s positioned on the upper row of icons all the way to
the right and adjacent to its next-of-kin, the Photos icon. We’ll be tapping
both icons throughout this chapter.
Let’s snap an image now:
1. Tap the Camera icon on the Home screen to turn the iPhone into the
rough equivalent of a Kodak Instamatic, minus the film and flash, of
course.
2. Keep your eyes fixed on the iPhone’s display.
The first thing you’ll notice on the screen is something resembling a
closed camera shutter. But that shutter will open in about a second,
revealing a window into what the camera lens sees. In case you were
wondering, the lens is hiding behind the small foxhole at the top-left
corner of the back of the iPhone. (The position of the camera lens is
shown in Chapter 1, Figure 1-3.)
3. Aim the camera at whatever you want to shoot, using the iPhone’s
brilliant 31⁄2-inch display as your viewfinder.
We’ve been marveling at the display throughout this book; the camera
application gives us another reason to do so.
4. When you are satisfied with what’s in the
frame, tap the camera icon at the bottom
of the screen (see Figure 9-1) to snap the
picture.
You’ll experience momentary shutter lag,
so be sure to remain still. When the shutter
reopens, you’ll see the image you have just
shot, but just for a blink. The screen will again function as a viewfinder
so you can capture your next image.
And that’s it, you’ve snapped your very first iPhone picture.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to capture additional images.
If you position the iPhone sideways while snapping an image, the picture is
saved in landscape mode.

Figure 9-1: Say cheese.

There are a couple more things to keep in mind while snapping pictures with
the iPhone.
In our experience, the iPhone camera button is super sensitive. We have acci-
dentally taken a few rotten snapshots because of it. So be careful; a gentle tap
is all that’s required to snap an image.
Moreover, we’re not sure Apple had this in mind, but the dock that was sup-
plied with the iPhone doubles as a handy mini-tripod (albeit without three
legs to stand on). It’s hardly a perfect solution, but you can leave the iPhone
docked and take a picture, without worrying too much about keeping the
camera steady.

Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
Tasty pixels and other digital camera treats
The iPhone is a 2-megapixel digital camera. And
if you’ve been shopping for a digital camera of
any type, you are already aware that megapixels
are marketed like chocolate chips. You know,
the more of them, the tastier the cookie, or in the
case of digital photography, the better the
camera. But that may not always be true. The
number of megapixels counts for sure, but so do
a bevy of other factors, including lens quality
and shutter lag.
The important thing to remember about
megapixels is that they are a measure of a
camera’s resolution, or picture sharpness,
which becomes particularly important to folks
who want to blow up prints well beyond snap-
shot size. For example, you’d probably want at
least a 4-megapixel standalone digital camera if
you hope to print decent 8-by-10-inch or larger
photos.
Which brings us back to the iPhone. From a
camera phone perspective, 2 megapixels is still
considered fairly decent, though you can cer-
tainly find more and more cell phones with a
higher megapixel count. Still, we figure most of
you will be more than satisfied with the pictures
you take with the iPhone, so long as you keep
your expectations in check and don’t expect to
produce poster-size images.
We’re obliged to point out, however, that the dig-
ital camera in the initial iPhone lacks some fea-
tures found on rival camera phones, notably a
flash and the ability to shoot short video clips.
There are no advanced editing features either.
All that said, those other camera phones can’t
hold a candle to the iPhone when it comes 
to showing off those images, as the rest of this
chapter proves. The iPhone’s high-resolution 480-
x-320 screen — yep, it’s measured in pixels —
is simply stunning.

98
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Importing Pictures
You needn’t use only the iPhone’s digital camera to get pictures onto the
device, of course, and in most cases, we suspect that you won’t. Instead, you
can synchronize photos from a PC or Macintosh using the iTunes Summary
pane, which is described in Chapter 3. (The assumption here is that you
already know how to get pictures onto your computer.)
Quickie reminder: On a Mac you can sync photos via iPhoto software version
4.03 or later and Aperture. And on a PC, you can sync with Adobe Photoshop
Album 2.0 or later and Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 or later. Alternatively,
with both computers, you can sync with any folder containing pictures.
When iPhoto is connected to your computer, click the Photos tab in the
Summary pane. Then click the appropriate check boxes to specify the pic-
tures and photos you want to synchronize. Or choose All Photos and Albums,
if you have enough storage on the iPhone to accommodate them.
Syncing pictures is a two-way process, so photos captured with the iPhone’s
digital camera can also end up in the photo library on your computer.
Where Have All My Pictures Gone?
So where exactly do your pictures hang out on the iPhone? The ones you
snapped on iPhone end up in a photo album appropriately dubbed the
Camera Roll. Of course, the photos you imported are readily available too
(and grouped in the same albums they were on the computer). We’ll show
you not only where they are, but how to display them and share them with
others — and how to dispose of the duds that don’t measure up to your lofty
photographic standards.
So get ready to literally get your fingers on the pix (without having to worry
about smudging them):
1. From the Camera application, tap the Camera Roll icon (refer to
Figure 9-1). Or you can tap the Photos icon on the Home screen, and
then tap Camera Roll or any other album in the list of Photo Albums.
The shutter closes for just an instant and is replaced by the screen
depicted in Figure 9-2, which shows thumbnail images of the complete
roll of pictures you’ve shot with the iPhone. This is the Camera Roll.

Using the first method, you can access
only the Camera Roll. Using the second
method, you can access the Camera
Roll and all your other photo albums.
2. Browse through the thumbnail
images in the album until you find the
picture you want to display.
If the thumbnail you have in mind
doesn’t appear on this screen, flick
your finger up or down to scroll
through the pictures rapidly or use a
slower dragging motion to pore
through the images more deliberately.
3. Tap the appropriate thumbnail.
The picture you’ve selected fills the
entire screen.
4. Tap the screen again.
The picture controls appear, as shown
in Figure 9-3. We discuss what these do
later.
5. To make the controls disappear, tap
the screen again, or just wait a few
seconds and they’ll go away on 
their own.
6. To transform the iPhone back into a picture-taker rather than a picture-
viewer, make sure the picture controls are displayed and then tap the
camera icon at the upper-right.
Note that this option is available only if you arrived at the Camera Roll
from the Camera application. If you didn’t, you have to back out of this
application altogether and tap the Home button and then the Camera
application icon to call the iPhone’s digital camera back into duty.
7. To return to the thumbnails view of your Camera Roll or the thumb-
nails for any of your other albums, make sure the picture controls are
displayed. Then tap the Camera Roll button at the upper left.
The Camera Roll button will carry the name of one of your other photo
albums if you are trying to return to that collection of pictures instead.

Admiring Pictures
Photographs are meant to be seen, of course, not buried in the digital equiva-
lent of a shoebox. And the iPhone affords you some neat ways to manipulate,
view, and share your best photos.
We already know from the preceding section how to find a photo and view it
full-screen and bring up picture controls. But you can do a lot of maneuvering
of pictures without summoning those controls. Here are some options:
 Skipping ahead or viewing the previous picture: Flick your finger left
or right or tap the left or right arrow controls.
 Landscape or portrait: The iPhone’s wizardry (or more specifically, the
device’s accelerometer sensor) is at work. When you turn the iPhone
sideways, the picture automatically reorients itself from portrait to land-
scape mode, as the images in Figure 9-4 show. Pictures shot in landscape
mode fill the screen when you rotate the iPhone. Rotate the device back
to portrait mode, and the picture readjusts accordingly.

 Zoom: Double-tap to zoom in on an image and make it larger. Do so again
to zoom out and make it smaller. Alternatively, take your thumb and
index finger and pinch to zoom in, or un-pinch the photo to zoom out.
 Pan and scroll: This cool little feature is practically guaranteed to make
you the life of the party. Once you’ve zoomed in on a picture, drag it
around the screen with your finger. Besides impressing your friends, you
can bring the part of the image you most care about front and center.
That’ll let you zoom in on Fido’s adorable face as opposed to, say, the
unflattering picture of the person holding the dog in his or her lap.
Figure 9-4: The same picture in portrait and landscape modes.
Launching Slideshows
Those of us who store a lot of photographs on computers are familiar with
running slideshows of those images. It’s a breeze to replicate the experience
on the iPhone:
1. Choose your Camera Roll or another album from the Photo Albums list.
To do so, tap the Photos icon from the Home screen or tap the Camera
Roll button in the Camera application.
2. If you see the play button at the bottom of the thumbnails screen, tap
it and you’re finished.
3. If you don’t see the play button at the bottom of the thumbnails screen,
tap a thumbnail to choose a photo, and then tap the play button.
You may have to tap the picture a second time to bring up the play button.
Enjoy the show.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Special slideshow effects
You can alter the length of time each slide is shown, change the transition
effects between pictures, and display images in random order. Here’s how.
From the Home screen, tap Settings and then scroll down and tap Photos.
Then tap any of the following to make changes:
 Play Each Slide For: You have five choices (2 seconds, 3 seconds, 
5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds). Tap the Photos button when you
are finished to return to the main Settings screen for Photos.
 Transition: This is the effect you see when you move from one slide to
the next. Again, there are five choices (cube, dissolve, ripple, wipe
across, wipe down). Why not try them all to see what you like? Tap the
Photos button when you are finished.
 Repeat: If turned on, the slideshow continues to loop until you stop it. If
off, the slideshow for your Camera Roll or album plays just once. The
Repeat control may be counterintuitive for some. If Off is showing, tap it
to turn on the Repeat function. If On is showing, tap it to turn off the
Repeat function.
 Shuffle: Turning this feature on plays slides in random order. As with the
Repeat feature, tap Off to turn on shuffle or tap On to turn off random
playback.
Tap the Home button to leave Settings and return to the Home screen.
Adding music to your slideshow
Ed loves backing up slideshows with Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, or Sarah
McLachlan, among numerous other artists. Bob loves using Beatles songs 
or stately classical music.
Adding music to a slideshow couldn’t be easier. Just tap iPod and begin play-
ing a song. Then return to the Photo application to start up a slideshow as
described in the beginning of the “Launching Slideshows” section.
Deleting pictures
We told a tiny fib by intimating that photographs are meant to be seen. We
should have amended that by saying that some pictures are meant to be
seen. For others, you can’t get rid of them fast enough. Fortunately, the
iPhone makes it a cinch to bury the evidence:

1. From the appropriate photo album, tap the objectionable photograph.
2. Tap to display the picture controls, provided they’re not already 
displayed.
3. Tap the trash can icon.
4. Tap Delete (or Cancel if you change your mind).
The photo gets sucked into the trash can and mercifully disappears.
More (Not So) Stupid Picture Tricks
You can take advantage of the photos on the iPhone in three more ways. In
each case you tap the picture and make sure the picture controls are dis-
played. Then tap the icon at the bottom left — the one that looks like an
arrow trying to escape from a rectangle. That displays the trio of choices
shown in Figure 9-5. Let’s explore these now.
 Use as Wallpaper: The default back-
ground image on the iPhone when you
unlock the device is a gorgeous view of
Earth. Dramatic though it may be, you
probably have an even better photo-
graph to use as the iPhone’s wallpaper.
A picture of your spouse, your kids, or
your pets, perhaps?
When you tap the Use as Wallpaper
button, you see what the present image
will look like as the iPhone’s back-
ground picture. And as Figure 9-6
shows, you are given the opportunity
to move the picture around and resize
it, through the now familiar action of
dragging or pinching against the screen
with your fingers. When you’re satisfied
with what the wallpaper will look like,
tap the Set Wallpaper button. Per usual,
you also have the option to tap Cancel.
More on Wallpaper in Chapter 13.
 Email Photo: Some photos are so pre-
cious that you just have to share them
with family members and friends.
When you tap Email Photo, the picture

is automatically embedded in the body
of an outgoing e-mail message. Use the
virtual keyboard to enter the e-mail
addresses, subject line, and any addi-
tional comments you’d like to add. You
know, something profound like, “Isn’t
this a great looking photo?” (Skip to
Chapter 11 for more info on using
e-mail.)
 Assign to Contact: If you assign a pic-
ture to someone in your Contacts list,
this image will pop up when you
receive a call from the person. To make
it happen, tap Assign to Contact. Your
list of contacts appears on the screen.
Scroll up or down the list to find the
person who matches the picture of the
moment. As with the wallpaper exam-
ple, you can drag and resize the picture
to get it just right. Then tap Set Photo.
As you may recall from Chapter 4, you
can also assign a photo to a contact by
starting out in Contacts. As a refresher,
start by tapping Phone, and then tap-
ping Contacts. From Contacts, choose
the person, tap Edit, and then tap Add
Photo. At that point, you can take a new picture with the iPhone’s digital
camera or select an existing portrait from one of your onboard picture
albums.
To change the picture you’ve assigned to a person, tap his or her name
in the Contacts list, tap Edit, and then tap the person’s thumbnail pic-
ture, which also carries the label Edit. From there, you can take another
photo with the iPhone’s digital camera, select another photo from one of
your albums, edit the photo you are already using (by resizing and drag-
ging it to a new position), or delete the photo.
You have just passed Photography 101 on the iPhone. We trust the course-
work was a, forgive the pun, snap.

The Internet
iPhone

T
he commercials for the iPhone say it provides
you with the real Internet — and it does. So in
this part we look at the Internet components of
your phone, starting with a chapter covering the
best Web browser ever to grace a handheld
device, Safari. We see how to take advantage of
links and bookmarks and how to open multiple
Web pages at the same time. We show you how to
run a Web search on an iPhone. And we spend
time discussing EDGE and Wi-Fi too, the wireless
networks that are compatible with the device.
Then we visit the Mail program and see how easy
it is to set up e-mail accounts and to send and
receive real honest-to-goodness e-mail messages
and attachments.
Finally, we examine three superb Web-enabled
applications. In Maps, you determine the busi-
nesses and restaurants you’d like to visit, and get
driving directions and the trafﬁc en route. In
Weather, you get the forecast for all the cities you
live in or plan on visiting. And in Stocks, you can
get the lowdown on how well the equities in your
portfolio are performing.

“T

That’s what Apple promised the iPhone would bring to the public when 
the product was announced in January 2007. Steve Jobs & Co. have come 
tantalizingly close to delivering on that pledge.
For years, the cell phone industry has been offering some
sort of watered-down mobile version of the Internet, but
the approaches fall far short of what you’ve come to
experience sitting in front of a computer.
Apple, however, has managed to replicate the real-
deal Internet with the iPhone. Web pages look like
Web pages do on a Windows PC or Macintosh, right
down to swanky graphics and pictures — and at
least some of the video.
Let’s find out more about navigating through cyber-
space on an iPhone.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Surfin’ Dude
A version of Apple’s Safari Web browser is a major reason the Net is the Net
on the iPhone. Safari for the Mac, and of late Windows, is one of the best Web
browsers in the computer business. And in our view it has no rival as a cell
phone browser.
Exploring the browser
It is worth starting our cyberexpedition with a quick tour of the Safari
browser. Take a gander at Figure 10-1. Not all the browser controls found on a
PC or Mac are present. Still, the iPhone’s Safari has a familiar look and feel.
We get to these and other controls throughout this chapter.

Chapter 10: Going On a Mobile Safari
Living on the EDGE
You can’t typically make or receive phone calls
on a wireless phone without tapping into a cel-
lular network. And you can’t prowl the virtual
corridors of cyberspace (or send e-mail) on a
mobile phone without accessing a wireless data
network. The iPhone is compatible with two
such data networks, Wi-Fi and AT&T’s EDGE. (It
also works with a third wireless technology
called Bluetooth, addressed in Chapter 13.)
The iPhone automatically hops onto the fastest
available network, which is almost always Wi-
Fi. Wi-Fi is the friendly moniker applied to the far
geekier 802.11 designation. And “eight-oh-two-
dot-eleven” (as it is pronounced) is followed by
a letter, typically (but not always) b, g, or n. So
you’ll see it written as 802.11b, 802.11g, and so
on. The letters relate to differing technical stan-
dards that have to do with the speed and range
you can expect out of the Wi-Fi configuration.
But we certainly wouldn’t have you lose any
sleep over this, if you haven’t boned up on this
geeky alphabet.
For the record, the iPhone adheres to 802.11b
and 802.11g standards, which means it works
with most common Internet routers available to
the masses and most public and private Internet
hotspots, found at airports, colleges, coffee-
houses, and elsewhere. If you have to present 
a password to take advantage of a for-fee
hotspot, you can enter it via the iPhone’s virtual
keyboard.
The problem with Wi-Fi is that it is far from ubiq-
uitous, which leads us right back to EDGE. If
you’re ever on a million dollar game show and
have to answer the question, EDGE is shorthand
for Enhanced Datarate for GSM Evolution. It’s
based on the global GSM phone standard.
AT&T describes EDGE as a speedy 3G, or third-
generation, data network, though you’ll get
plenty of arguments to the contrary. Some
describe EDGE as a 2.5G or 2.75G network
because it is far pokier than some rival high-
speed data networks.
The bottom line is this: Depending on where you
live or work, you may feel like you are teetering
on the EDGE in terms of acceptable Internet
coverage. We’ve used the iPhone in areas
where Web pages load really slowly, not-so-
vaguely reminiscent of dial-up telephone
modems for your computer.
So why did Apple and AT&T choose EDGE for
the iPhone? One reason is that EDGE is darn
pervasive, at least according to AT&T; it says its
network is available in more than 13,000 cities
and towns and along 40,000 miles of highways.
The 3G networks also hog more power than
EDGE, a potentially serious hit on the iPhone’s
battery life. (Of course, Wi-Fi can put strains 
on a battery too.) And 3G networks weren’t 
standardized until pretty far into iPhone’s 
development.
There is already speculation about when Apple
will unveil a true 3G-capable iPhone, but the
company is characteristically mum on its future
plans. Unfortunately, although Apple can fix
bugs and upgrade certain iPhone features
through software, they would have to introduce
new hardware to take advantage of zippier 
networks.
Before plunging in, we recommend a little detour. Read the “Living on the
EDGE” sidebar to find out more about the wireless networks that let you surf
the Web on the iPhone in the first place.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Blasting off into cyberspace
So we’ve told you how great Web pages look on the iPhone and you’re eager
to get going. We won’t hold you back much longer.
When you start by tapping the address field, the virtual keyboard appears.
You may notice one thing about the keyboard right off the bat. Because so
many Web addresses end with the suffix .com (pronounced “dotcom”), the
virtual keyboard has a dedicated .com key. But for other common Web suf-
fixes such as .edu, .gov, .net, and .org, you’ll have to tap out all the letters.
Of equal importance, both the . (period) and the / (slash) are on the virtual
keyboard, because they too are frequently entered in Web addresses.
The moment you tap a single letter, you see
a list of Web addresses that match those 
letters. For example, if you tap the letter E as
we did in the example in Figure 10-2, you’ll
see Web listings for EarthLink, and eBay, and
so on. Tapping U or H instead may bring up
URLs for USA TODAY or the Houston
Chronicle, shameless plugs for the newspa-
pers where Ed and Bob are columnists.
The iPhone has two ways to determine
Web sites to suggest when you tap letters.
One method is the Web sites you’ve
already bookmarked from the Safari or
Internet Explorer browsers on your com-
puter (and synchronized as described in
Chapter 3). More on bookmarks later in
this chapter.
The second method is sites from the
History list, those cyberdestinations you’ve
recently hung your hat in. Because history
repeats itself, we’ll also tackle that topic
later in the chapter.
Figure 10-2: Matching Web pages.

Let’s open our first Web page now — and a full HTML page at that, to borrow
from techie lingo:
1. Tap the Safari icon at the bottom of the Home screen.
It’s another member of the Fantastic Four (along with Phone, Mail, and
iPod).
2. Tap the address field (labeled in Figure 10-1).
If you can’t see the address field, tap the status bar or scroll to the top of
the screen.
3. Begin typing the Web address, or URL (Uniform Resource Locator for
you trivia buffs), on the virtual keyboard that slides up from the
bottom of the screen.
4. Do one of the following:
a. To accept one of the bookmarked (or other) sites that show up on
the list, merely tap the name.
Safari automatically fills in the URL in the address field and takes
you where you want to go.
b. Keep tapping the proper keyboard characters until you’ve
entered the complete Web address for the site you have in mind,
and then tap Go at the bottom-right corner of the keyboard.
It is not necessary to type www at the beginning of a URL. So to
visit www.theonion.com, for example, entering theonion.com is
sufficient. You are transported to the site in question.
Even though Safari on the iPhone can render Web pages the way they are
meant to be displayed on a computer, every so often you may run into a site
that will serve up the light, or mobile, version of the Web site, sometimes
known as a WAP site. Graphics may be stripped down on such sites. Alas, the
producers of these sites may be unwittingly discriminating against you for
dropping in on them via a cell phone. Never mind that the cell phone in this
case is an iPhone. You have our permission to berate them with letters,
e-mails, and phone calls until they get with the program.
I Can See Clearly Now
Now that you know how to open up a Web page, we’ll show you how radically
simple it is to zoom in on the pages so you can read what you want to read
and see what you want to see, without enlisting a magnifying glass.

Chapter 10: Going On a Mobile Safari

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Try these neat tricks:
 Double-tap the screen so
that that portion of the text
fills up the entire screen:
It’ll take just a second before
the screen comes into focus.
By way of example, check
out Figure 10-3. It shows 
two views of the same Sports
Illustrated Web page. In the
first view, you see what the
page looks like when you
first arrive. In the second,
you see how the middle
column takes over the screen
after you double-tapped on 
it. To return to the first view,
double-tap the screen again.
 Pinch the page: Sliding your thumb and index finger together and then
spreading them apart (or as we like to say, un-pinching) also zooms in
and out of a page. Again, wait just a moment for the screen to come 
into focus.
 Press down on a page and drag it in all directions, or flick through 
a page from top to bottom: You are panning and scrolling, baby.
 Rotate the iPhone
to its side: Watch
what happens to
the White House
Web site shown 
in Figure 10-4. It
reorients from
portrait to a
widescreen view.
The keyboard is
also wider, making
it a little easier to
enter a new URL.
Figure 10-3: Doing a double-tap dance zooms in
and out.
Figure 10-4: Going wide.

Opening multiple Web pages at once
When we surf the Web on a desktop PC or laptop, we rarely go to a single
Web page and call it a day. In fact, we often have multiple Web pages open at
the same time. Sometimes it’s because we choose to hop around the Web
without closing the pages we’ve visited.
Sometimes a link (see the next section)
automatically opens a new page without
shuttering the old one. (If they’re advertise-
ments, these additional pages aren’t always
welcome.)
Safari on the iPhone lets you open multiple
pages simultaneously. Tap the pages icon
(labeled in Figure 10-1), which is on the
right side of the navigation bar at the
bottom of the screen, and then tap New
Page on the screen that pops up next. Tap
the address field and type a URL for your
new page.
The number inside the pages icon lets you
know how many pages are open. To see the
other open pages, flick your finger to the
left or right as shown in Figure 10-5. Tap a
page to have it take over the full screen.
To close one of your open Web pages, tap
the white x in the red circle, which appears
in the upper-left corner.
Lovable links
Surfing the Web would be a real drag if you had to enter a URL each time you
wanted to navigate from one page to another. That’s why bookmarks are so
useful. And it’s why handy links are welcome too. Because Safari functions on
the iPhone the same way browsers work on your PC or Mac, links on the
iPhone pretty much behave the same way too.
Text links that transport you from one site to another are usually underlined
in blue. Merely tap the link to go directly to that site.
But tapping on some other links leads to different outcomes:
 Open a map: Tapping on a map launches the Google Maps application
that will be, um, addressed in Chapter 12.
113
Chapter 10: Going On a Mobile Safari
Figure 10-5: All open for business.

114
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 Prepare an e-mail: Tap an e-mail address and the iPhone opens the Mail
program (see the next chapter), and pre-populates the To field with that
address. The virtual keyboard is also summoned so you can add other
e-mail addresses and compose a subject line and message.
 Make a phone call: Tap a phone number embedded in a Web page, and
the iPhone offers to dial it for you. Just tap Call to make it happen or
Cancel to forget the whole thing.
To see the URL for a link, press your finger against the link and keep it there.
This is also a way to determine if a picture has a link.
Not every Web link will cooperate with the iPhone. As of this writing, the
iPhone didn’t support some common Web standards, notably Adobe Flash
video and Java. It’s a void we hope is addressed — and Apple can apply such
an upgrade if it so chooses through a software update. In the meantime, if
you come upon an incompatible link, nothing may happen or a message will
be displayed about having to install a plug-in.
Book(mark) ’em Dano
You already know how useful bookmarks are
and how you can synchronize bookmarks
from the browsers on your computer. It’s
equally simple to bookmark a Web page
directly on the iPhone:
1. With the page you want to bookmark
open, tap the + in the upper-left corner
of the screen.
Scroll to the top of the screen if the + is
not visible. The Add Bookmark screen
appears, as shown in Figure 10-6, with a
default name and folder location.
2. To accept the default bookmark name
and default bookmark folder, tap Save.
3. To change the default bookmark name,
tap the x in the circle next to the name
and enter the new title with the virtual
keyboard. Then tap Save.
4. To change the location where the
bookmark is saved, tap the > in the
Bookmarks field and then tap the
folder where you want the bookmark
kept. Then tap Save.
Figure 10-6: Turning into a bookie.

To open a bookmarked page after you’ve set it up, tap the bookmarks icon at
the bottom of the screen (labeled in Figure 10-1) and then tap the appropriate
bookmark.
If the bookmark you have in mind is buried inside a folder, tap the folder
name first and then the bookmark.
Altering bookmarks
If a bookmarked site is no longer meaningful, you can change it or get rid of it :
 To remove a bookmark (or folder), tap the bookmarks icon and then tap
Edit. Tap the red circle next to the bookmark you want to toss off the list
and then tap Delete.
 To change a bookmark name or location, tap Edit and then tap the book-
mark. The Edit Bookmark screen appears with the name, URL, and loca-
tion of the bookmark already filled in. Tap the fields you want to change.
In the name field, tap the x in the gray circle and then use the keyboard
to enter a new title. In the location field, tap the > and scroll up or down
the list until you find a new home for your bookmark.
 To create a new folder for your bookmarks, tap Edit and then tap the
New Folder button. Enter the name of the new folder and choose where
to put it.
 To move a bookmark up or down on a list, tap Edit and then drag the
three bars to the right of the bookmark name.
Letting History repeat itself
Sometimes you want to revisit a site that you failed to bookmark. But you
can’t remember what the darn destination was called or what led you there in
the first place. Good thing you can study the history books.
Safari records the pages you visit and keeps the logs on hand for several
days. Tap the bookmarks icon, tap History, and then tap the day you think
you hung out at the site. When you find it, tap the listing. You are about to
make your triumphant return.
To clear your history so nobody else can trace your steps — and just what is
it you are hiding? — tap Clear at the bottom of the History list. Alternately,
tap Settings on the Home page, tap Safari, and then tap Clear History. In both
instances, per usual, you’ll have a chance to back out without wiping the
slate clean.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Launching a mobile search mission
Most of us spend a lot of time on the Internet with search engines. And the
search engines we summon most often are Google and Yahoo! So it goes on
the iPhone.
Although you can certainly use the virtual
keyboard to type google.com or yahoo.com
in the Safari address field, Apple doesn’t
require that tedious effort. Instead, you tap
into Google or Yahoo! via the dedicated
search box shown in Figure 10-7. The default
search engine of choice on the iPhone is
Google, with Yahoo the first runner-up.
To conduct a Web search on the iPhone, tap
the address field and then tap the Google (or
Yahoo!) search field. Enter your search term
or phrase and then tap the Google (or
Yahoo!) button at the bottom-right of the
keyboard to generate pages of results. Tap
any search results that look promising.
To switch the search box from Google to
Yahoo! and vice versa, tap Settings on the
Home page, scroll down and tap Safari, tap
Search Engine, and then tap to choose one
search behemoth over the other.
Smart Safari Settings
Along with the riches galore found on the Internet are places in cyberspace
where you’ll get hassled. Some of you may take pains to protect your privacy
and maintain your security.
Let’s return to Settings, by tapping the Settings icon on the Home page. Now
tap Safari.
We’ve already discovered how to change the default search engine and clear
the record of the sites we’ve visited through Settings. Now let’s see what else
we can do:
Figure 10-7: Conducting a Google
search about iPhone on the iPhone.

 Clear cookies: We’re not talking about crumbs you may have acciden-
tally dropped on the iPhone. Cookies are tiny bits of information that a
Web site places on the iPhone when you visit so that they’ll recognize
you when you return. You need not assume the worst; most cookies are
benign. But if this concept wigs you out, you can do a few things.
Tap Clear Cookies at the bottom of the screen and then tap it again
(instead of tapping Cancel). Separately, tap Accept Cookies and then tap
Never. Theoretically, you will never receive cookies on the iPhone again.
A good middle ground is to accept cookies only from the sites you visit.
To do so, tap From Visited. You can also tap Always to accept cookies
from all sites.
If you don’t set the iPhone to accept cookies, certain Web pages won’t
load properly.
Tap Safari to return to the main Safari settings page.
 Clear the cache: The cache stores content from some Web pages so
they load faster the next time you stop by. Tap Clear Cache and then tap
Clear Cache again on the next screen to, you guessed it, clear the cache.
 Turn JavaScript on or off: This setting is on when the blue On button is
showing and off when the white Off button is showing. Programmers use
JavaScript to add various functionality to Web pages, from displaying
the date and time to changing images when you mouse over them.
However, some security risks have also been associated with JavaScript.
 Turn plug-ins on or off: These are typically associated with certain
types of video.
 Block pop-ups: Pop-ups are those Web pages that show up whether you
want them to or not. Often they are annoying advertisements. But at
some sites you’ll welcome the appearance of pop-ups, so remember to
turn blocking off under such circumstances.
Taming Safari is just the start of exploiting the Internet on the iPhone. In
upcoming chapters, you discover how to master e-mail, maps, and more.

The E-Mail Must Get Through
In This Chapter
 Setting up your accounts
 Sending e-mail messages
 Reading and managing e-mail messages
 Setting e-mail preferences
You saw how well your iPhone sends SMS text messages in Chapter 5. But
SMS text messages aren’t the iPhone’s only written communication trick,
not by a long shot. One of the niftiest things your iPhone can do is send and
receive real, honest-to-gosh e-mail, using Mail, its modern e-mail application.
It’s designed not only to send and receive text e-mail messages, but also to
handle rich HTML e-mail messages — formatted e-mail messages complete
with font and type styles and embedded graphics.
Furthermore, your iPhone can read several types of file
attachments, including PDF, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft
Excel documents. Better still, all this sending and receiv-
ing of text, graphics, and documents can happen in the
background, so you can surf the Web or talk to a
friend while your iPhone quietly and efficiently han-
dles your e-mail behind the scenes.
Prep Work: Setting Up 
Your Accounts
First things first. To use Mail you need an e-mail address. If
you have broadband Internet access (that is, a cable modem
or DSL), you probably received one or more e-mail addresses 
when you signed up. If you are one of the handful of readers who 
don’t already have an e-mail account, you can get one for free from Yahoo!
(http://mail.yahoo.com), Google (http://mail.google.com), and many
other service providers.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Using Yahoo mail has a small advantage. The free accounts it offers are
known as “push” e-mail, which means your messages are delivered to your
iPhone as soon as they are received by the mail server. With other e-mail
accounts, your iPhone doesn’t check for new messages until you ask it to.
Many (if not all) free e-mail providers add a small bit of advertising at the end
of your outgoing messages. If you’d rather not be a billboard for your e-mail
provider, either use the address(es) that came with your broadband Internet
access (yourname@comcast.net, yourname@att.net, and so on) or pay a few
dollars a month for a premium e-mail account that doesn’t tack advertising
(or anything else) onto your messages.
Set up your account the easy way
Remember way back in Chapter 3, you had the option of automatically sync-
ing the e-mail accounts on your computer with your iPhone? If you chose to
do so, your e-mail accounts should be configured on your iPhone already.
You can go directly to the “Darling, You Send Me (E-Mail)” section.
If you didn’t choose that option but would like to set up your account the
easy way now, go back to Chapter 3 and reread that section, sync your
iPhone, and then you, too, can go directly to the “Darling, You Send Me 
(E-Mail)” section.
Set up your account the less easy way
If you don’t want to sync the e-mail accounts on your computer, you can set
up an e-mail account on your iPhone manually. It’s not quite as easy as click-
ing a box and syncing your iPhone, but it’s not rocket science either.
If you have no mail accounts on your iPhone, the first time you launch Mail
you’ll be walked through the following procedure. If instead you have one or
more mail accounts on your iPhone already and want to add a new account
manually, start by tapping Settings on the Home screen, and then tap Mail,
Accounts, and Add Accounts.
Either way, you should now be staring at the Add Account screen, which is
shown in Figure 11-1. Proceed to one of the next two sections, depending on
your e-mail account.

Setting up a mail account with Yahoo!,
Google, .Mac, or AOL
If your account is with Yahoo!, Google,
.Mac, or AOL, tap the appropriate button
on the Add Account screen now. If your
account is with a provider other than these
four, tap the Other button and skip ahead
to the next section.
Enter your name, e-mail address, and 
password, as shown in Figure 11-2. There’s
a field for a description of this account
(such as work or personal), but it’s
optional so feel free to leave it blank if 
you want.
Tap the Save button in the top-right corner
of the screen. You’re finished. That’s all
there is to setting up your account.
Setting up an account with another
provider
If your e-mail account is with a provider
other than Yahoo!, Google, .Mac, or AOL,
you have a bit more work ahead of you to
set up an account.
You’re going to need a bunch of information about your e-mail account that
you may not know or have handy. 
We suggest that you scan the following instructions, note the items you don’t
know, and go find them out before you continue. To find them, look at the
documentation you received when you signed up for your e-mail account 
or visit the account provider’s Web site and search there. If you work in a
business and are trying to access your business e-mail, try contacting your
company’s IT (information technology) person or department to get the 
necessary information.

Figure 11-1: Tap a button to add an
account.

122
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Figure 11-2: Just fill ’em in, tap Save, and you’re ready to rock.
Now here’s how you set up an account:
1. On the Add Account screen, tap the Other button.
2. Tap the button at the top of the screen that denotes the type of 
e-mail server this account uses: IMAP, POP, or Exchange, as shown 
in Figure 11-3.
3. Enter the e-mail address for this account.
4. (Optional) Enter a description of this account (such as work or 
personal).
5. Enter the Internet host name for your incoming mail server, which
should look something like mail.providername.com.
6. Enter the Internet host name for your outgoing mail server, which
should look something like smtp.providername.com.
7. Enter your user name and password for both servers.
8. Tap the Save button in the upper-right corner to create the account.
Optional
field 

Some outgoing mail servers don’t need
your user name and password. The fields
for these items on your iPhone note that
they are optional. Still, we suggest that you
fill them in anyway. It will save you from
having to add them later if your outgoing
mail server does require an account name
and password, which many do these days.
If your mail server is an Exchange server, it
has to be configured for IMAP. Don’t worry
if you don’t know what that means. Because
Exchange servers are almost always
deployed in large organizations, it’s more
than likely you have an IT person or depart-
ment that can help. Just remember that if
your Exchange server isn’t set up for IMAP,
you won’t be able to use this account with
your iPhone.
Indeed, around the time of the iPhone’s
early summer 2007 launch, many employers
were cautiously taking a wait-and-see atti-
tude before letting the troops send and
receive company e-mail on the device.
Apple has been working with major corpo-
rations on pilot programs to address any
e-mail concerns they might have. By the
time you read this, many more companies
may have embraced e-mail on the iPhone.
Darling, You Send Me (E-Mail)
Now that your account or accounts are set up, let’s look at how to use your
iPhone to send e-mail.
Makin’ messages
There are several subspecies of messages: pure text, text with a photo, a par-
tially finished message you want to save and complete later (called a draft), a
reply to an incoming message, forwarding an incoming message to someone
else, and so on. Let’s examine these subsets one at a time.
Sending an all-text message
To compose a new e-mail message, tap Mail on your Home screen. You
should see a screen that looks pretty much like the one in Figure 11-4.
123
Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
Figure 11-3: If you’re not a Yahoo!,
Google, .Mac, or AOL user you have
slightly more fields to fill in before
you can rock.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Figure 11-4: The mailboxes screen.
Don’t worry if yours doesn’t look exactly like this or if your folders have dif-
ferent names.
Now to create a new message:
1. Tap the new message button (labeled in Figure 11-4) in the lower-right
corner of the screen.
A screen like the one shown in Figure 11-5 appears.
2. Type the names or e-mail addresses of the recipients in the To or CC
(carbon copy) field, or tap the + button on the right side of the To or
CC field to choose a contact from your iPhone’s address book.
If you start typing an e-mail address, e-mail addresses that match what
you’ve typed appear in a list below the To or CC field. If the correct one
is in the list, tap it to use it.

3. Type a subject in the Subject field.
The subject is optional but it’s consid-
ered poor form to send an e-mail mes-
sage without one.
4. Type your message in the message
area.
The message area is immediately
below the Subject field.
5. Tap the Send button in the top-right
corner of the screen.
Your message will wing its way to its recipi-
ents almost immediately. If you are not in
range of a Wi-Fi network or the AT&T EDGE
data network when you tap Send, the mes-
sage is sent the next time you are in range
of either network.
Sending a photo with a text message
Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand
words. When that’s the case, here’s how 
to send an e-mail message with a photo
enclosed.
Tap the Photos icon on the Home screen
and then find the photo you want to send.
Tap the button that looks like a little rectangle with a curved arrow springing
out of it in the bottom-left corner of the screen, and then tap the Email Photo
button.
An e-mail message appears on the screen with the photo already attached.
Just address the message and type whatever text you like, as you did for an
all-text message in the preceding section, and then tap the Send button.
Saving an e-mail message so you can send it later
Sometimes you start an e-mail message but don’t have time to finish it. When
that happens you can save it as a draft and finish it some other time.

appears ready for you to start typing
the recipient’s name.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Here’s how: Start an e-mail message as described in one of the two previous
sections. When you’re ready to save it as a draft, tap the Cancel button in the
top-left corner of the screen. Now tap the Save button if you want to save this
message as a draft and complete it at another time. If you tap the Cancel
button, you’ll cancel the cancel command and go right back to the message
and can continue working on it now.
If you tap the Don’t Save button, the message disappears immediately with-
out a second chance. Don’t tap Don’t Save unless you mean it.
To work on the message again, tap the Drafts mailbox. A list of all the mes-
sages you’ve saved as drafts appears. Tap the one you want to work on and it
reappears on the screen. When you’re finished, you can tap Send to send it,
or tap Cancel to save it as a draft again.
The number of drafts appears on the right of the Drafts folder, the same way
that the number of unread messages appears on the right of other mail fold-
ers such as your Inbox.
Replying to or forwarding an e-mail message
When you receive a
message and want
to reply to it, open
the message and
then tap the
reply/reply all/for-
ward button, which
looks like a curved
arrow at the bottom
of the screen, as
shown in Figure
11-6. Then tap either
the Reply, Reply All,
or Forward button.
The Reply button
creates a blank e-mail
message addressed
to the sender of the
original message.
The Reply All button
creates a blank e-mail
message addressed to the sender and all other recipients of the original mes-
sage. In both cases the subject is retained with a Re: prefix added. So if the origi-
nal subject was iPhone Tips, the reply’s subject would be Re: iPhone Tips.

Figure 11-6: Reading and managing an e-mail message.

Tapping the Forward button creates an unaddressed e-mail message that 
contains the text of the original message. Add the e-mail address(es) of the
person or people you want to forward the message to, and then tap Send. In
this case, instead of a Re: prefix, the subject is preceded by Fwd:. So this time
the subject would be Fwd: iPhone Tips.
You can edit the subject line of a reply or a forwarded message or edit the
body text of a forwarded message the same way you would edit any other
text. It’s usually considered good form to leave the subject lines alone (with
the Re: or Fwd: prefix intact), but there may be times when you want to
change them. Now you know that you can.
To send your reply or forwarded message, tap the Send button as usual.
Settings for sending e-mail
Four settings involve sending e-mail. Here’s what they do and where to find
them:
 To hear an alert when you successfully send a message: Tap the Sound
icon on the Home screen, and then turn on the Sent Mail setting. If you
want to change other settings, tap the Settings button in the top-left
corner of the screen. If you’re finished setting settings, tap the Home
button on the front of your iPhone.
The preceding paragraph is similar for all of the settings I discuss in this
section and later sections, so I won’t repeat them again. To summarize, if
you want to continue using settings, you tap whichever button appears
in the top-left corner of the screen — sometimes it’s called Settings, or
Mail, or Mailboxes, or something else. The point is that the top-left
button always returns you to the previous screen so you can change
other settings. And the same applies to pressing the Home button on the
front of your iPhone when you’re finished setting a setting. That always
saves the change you’ve just made and returns you to the Home screen.
 To add a signature line, phrase, or block of text to every e-mail mes-
sage you send: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, and
then tap Signature. The default signature is Sent from my iPhone. You can
add text before or after it, or delete it and type something else. Your sig-
nature is now affixed to the end of all of your outgoing e-mail.
 To have your iPhone send you a copy of every message you send: Tap
the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, and then turn on the
Always Cc Myself setting.
127
Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 To set the default e-mail account for sending e-mail from the Photos or
Maps applications: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail,
and then tap Default Account. Tap the account you want to use as the
default. Note that this setting applies only if you have more than one
e-mail account on your iPhone.
And that’s what you need to know about settings that apply to sending mail.

Working with Messages
The other half of the mail equation is receiving and reading the stuff.
Fortunately, you’ve already done most of the heavy lifting when you set up
your e-mail accounts. Getting and reading your mail is a piece of cake.
You can tell when you have unread mail by looking at the Mail icon, in the
bottom row of your Home screen. The number of unread messages appears
in a little red circle on the top-right of the icon.
Reading messages
To read your mail, tap the Mail icon on the Home screen. The mailboxes list
appears, and the Inbox in that list displays the number of unread messages in
a blue oval to the right of its name.
If you have more than one e-mail account, you may have to tap the Mailboxes
button in the upper-left corner and then choose the appropriate e-mail
account before you see the Inbox with the unread messages.
To see the list of unread messages, tap Inbox in the list of mailboxes and then
tap a message to read it. When a message is on the screen, buttons for man-
aging incoming messages appear below it (refer to Figure 11-6).
Managing messages
When a message is on your screen, you can do the following in addition to
reading it (all buttons are labeled in Figure 11-6):
 View the next message by tapping the next message button.
 View the previous message by tapping the previous message button.

 Check for new messages by tapping the check for new messages button.
 File this message in another folder by tapping the file message button.
When the list of folders appears, tap the folder where you want to file
the message.
 Delete this message by tapping the delete message button.
 Reply, reply to all, or forward this message (as discussed previously) by
tapping the reply/reply all/forward button.
 Create a new e-mail message by tapping the new message button.
You can delete e-mail messages without opening them in two ways:
 Swipe left or right across the message and then tap the red Delete
button that appears to the right of the message.
 Tap the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the screen, tap the red
minus (–) button to the left of the message, and then tap the red Delete
button that appears to the right of the message.
Don’t grow too attached to attachments
Your iPhone can even receive e-mail messages with attachments in a wide
variety of file formats. What file formats does the iPhone support? Glad you
asked. It can read and display .c, .cpp, .diff, .doc, .docx, .h, .hpp, .htm, .html,
.m, .mm, .patch, .pdf, .txt, .xls, .and xlsx.
If the attachment is a file format not supported by the iPhone (for example, a
Photoshop .psd file), you’ll see the name of the file but you won’t be able to
open it on your iPhone.
Here’s how to read an attachment:
1. Open the mail message containing the attachment.
2. Tap the attachment (it appears at the bottom of the message so you’ll
probably need to scroll down to see it).
The attachment downloads to your iPhone and opens automatically, as
shown in Figure 11-7.
3. Read the attachment.
4. Tap the Message button in the upper-left corner of the screen to
return to the message text.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
More things you can do with messages
But wait! You can do even more with your
incoming e-mail messages:
 To see all the recipients of a message,
tap the word Details (displayed in
blue) to the right of the sender’s name.
If all recipients are displayed, the word
in blue will be Hide rather than Details.
Tap it to hide all names but the
sender’s.
 To add an e-mail recipient or sender to
your contacts, tap the name or e-mail
address at the top of the message and
then tap either Create New Contact or
Add to Existing Contact.
 To mark a message as unread, tap Mark
as Unread, which appears near the top
of each message in blue with a blue dot
to its left. When you do, the message
will again be included in the unread
message count on the Mail icon on
your Home screen and its mailbox and
will again have a blue dot next to it in
the message list for that mailbox.
 To zoom in, double-tap the place you want to zoom in on. Double-tap
again to zoom out.
For more precise control over zooming, pinch and un-pinch instead of
double-tapping.
 To follow a link in a message, tap the link. Links are typically displayed
in blue. If the link is a URL, Safari opens and displays the Web page. If the
link is a phone number, the Phone application opens and offers to dial
the number. If the link is a Map, Maps opens and displays the location.
And last but not least, if the link is an e-mail address, a new pre-
addressed blank e-mail message is created.
If the link opens Safari, Phone, or Maps and you want to return to your
e-mail, press the Home button on the front of your iPhone and then tap
the Mail icon.

Word file that was attached to an
incoming e-mail message.

Setting your message and account settings
Our last lesson on Mail involves more settings, this time settings that affect
viewing and checking e-mail and messages that deal with your e-mail
accounts themselves.
Checking and viewing e-mail settings
Seven settings involve checking and viewing e-mail. You might want to modify
one or more, so here’s what they do and where to find them:
 To set how often the iPhone checks for new messages: Tap the Settings
icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, and then tap Auto-Check. Your
choices are Manual, Every 15 Minutes, Every 30 Minutes, or Every Hour.
Tap the one you prefer.
If you have Yahoo! e-mail, this setting is irrelevant. Your messages are
sent to your iPhone automatically as soon as they hit the Yahoo! mail
server.
 To hear an alert sound when you receive a new message: Tap the
Sound icon on the Home screen, and then turn on the New Mail setting.
 To set the number of recent messages that appears in your Inbox: Tap
the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, and then tap Show. Your
choices are 25, 50, 75, 100, or 200. Tap the number you prefer.
You can always see more messages in your Inbox regardless of this set-
ting by scrolling all the way to the bottom and tapping Download More.
 To set the number of lines of each message that are displayed in the
message list: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, tap
Preview, and then choose a number. Your choices are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
lines of text. The more lines of text you display in the list, the fewer mes-
sages you can see at a time without scrolling. Think before you choose 4
or 5.
 To set the font size for messages: Tap the Settings icon on the Home
screen, tap Mail, and then tap Minimum Font Size. Your options are
Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, or Giant. Use trial and error to find
out which size you prefer. Choose one and then read a message. If it’s
not just right, choose a different size. Repeat until you’re happy.
 To set whether or not the iPhone shows the To and Cc labels in mes-
sage lists: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, and then
turn the Show To/Cc Label setting on or off.
131
Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through

132
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 To turn the Ask Before Deleting warning on or off: Tap the Settings
icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, and then turn the Ask Before Deleting
setting on or off. If this setting is turned on, you need to tap the trash
can icon at the bottom of the screen and then tap the red Delete button
to confirm the deletion. When it’s turned off, tapping the trash can icon
deletes the message and you never see a red Delete button.
Altering account settings
The last set of settings we explore deals with your e-mail accounts. Most of
you will never need most of these settings, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t at
least mention them briefly. So here they are, whether you need ’em or not:
 To stop using an e-mail account: Tap the Settings icon on the Home
screen, tap Mail, and then tap the account name. Tap the switch to turn
off the account.
This setting doesn’t delete the account; it only hides it from view and
stops it from sending or checking e-mail until you turn it on again.
 To delete an e-mail account: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen,
tap Mail, and then tap the account name. Scroll to the very bottom and
tap the red button that says Delete Account. You’ll be given a chance to
reconsider. Tap Delete Account if you’re sure you want this account
blown away or Cancel if you change your mind and want to keep it.
The last four settings are somewhat advanced and are all reached the same
way: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, and then tap the
name of the account you want to work with. Then:
 To set how long until deleted messages are removed permanently
from your iPhone: Tap Advanced, and then tap Remove. Your choices
are Never, After One Day, After One Week, or After One Month. Tap the
choice you prefer.
 To set whether drafts, sent messages, and deleted messages are stored
on your iPhone or on your mail server: Tap Advanced, and then
choose the setting (Stored on iPhone or Stored on Server) for Drafts,
Sent Messages, and Deleted Messages. If you choose to store any or all
of them on the server, you won’t be able to see them unless you have an
Internet connection (Wi-Fi or EDGE). If you choose to store them on your
iPhone, they’ll always be available whether or not you have Internet
access.

We strongly recommend that you not change these next two items
unless you know exactly what you’re doing and why. If you’re having
problems with sending or receiving mail, start by contacting your ISP
(Internet service provider), e-mail provider, or corporate IT person or
department. Then, only change these settings if they tell you to.
 To reconfigure mail server settings: Tap Host Name, User Name, or
Password in the Incoming Mail Server or Outgoing Mail Server section of
the account settings screen and make your changes.
 To adjust Incoming or Outgoing SSL, Authentication, or IMAP Path 
settings: Tap Advanced, and then tap the appropriate item and make the
necessary changes.
And that, as they say in baseball, retires the side. You are now fully qualified
to set up e-mail accounts and send and receive e-mail on your iPhone.

Monitoring Maps, Scrutinizing
Stocks, and Watching Weather
In This Chapter
 Mapping your route with Maps
 Getting quotes with Stocks
 Watching the weather with Weather
I
n this chapter we look at three of the iPhone’s Internet-enabled applica-
tions: Maps, Stocks, and Weather. We call them Internet-enabled because
they display information collected over your Internet connection — whether
Wi-Fi or EDGE — in real (or in the case of Stocks, near-real) time.
Maps Are Where It’s At . . .
Maps has turned out to be the sleeper hit of our iPhone
experience and an application we both use more than
we expected. That’s because it’s so darn handy. With
Maps, you can quickly and easily find nearby restau-
rants and businesses, get turn-by-turn driving
instructions from any address to any other address,
and see real-time traffic information for any location.
Finding a person, place, 
or thing with Maps
Tap the Maps icon on the Home screen, and then tap the
search field at the top of the screen to make the keyboard 
appear. Now type what you’re looking for. You can search for 
addresses, zip codes, intersections, towns, landmarks, businesses by 
category and by name, and combinations, such as New York, NY 10022, pizza
60645 or Auditorium Shores Austin TX.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
If the letters you type match names in your
Contacts list, the matching contacts appear
in a list below the search field. Tap a name
to see a map of that contact’s location.
Maps is smart about it, too; it displays only
the names of contacts with a street address.
When you finish typing, tap Search. After a
few seconds, a map appears. If you
searched for a single location, it is marked
with a single pushpin. If you searched for a
category (pizza 60645, for example), you
see multiple pushpins, one for each match-
ing location, as shown in Figure 12-1.
So that’s how to find just about anything
with Maps. Now let’s look at some of the
ways you can use what you find.
Views, zooms, and pans
Let’s start by finding out how to work with
what you see on the screen. Three views are
available at any time: Map, Satellite, and
List. (Figure 12-1 shows the Map view.)
Select the one you want by tapping its
button at the bottom of the screen.
In Map or Satellite view, you can zoom to see more or less of the map, or
scroll (pan) to see what’s above, below, or to the left or right of what’s on the
screen:
 To zoom out: Pinch the map or double-tap using two fingers. To zoom
out even more, pinch or double-tap using two fingers again.
This is a new concept. To double-tap with two fingers, merely tap twice
in rapid succession with two fingers rather than the usual one finger.
(That’s a total of four taps, two taps per finger.)
 To zoom in: Un-pinch the map or double-tap (the usual way — with just
one finger) the spot you want to zoom in on. Un-pinch or double-tap
with one finger again to zoom in even more.
Figure 12-1: Search for pizza 60645
and you see pushpins for all nearby
pizza joints.

An un-pinch is the opposite of a pinch. Start with your thumb and a
finger together and then flick them apart.
You can also un-pinch with two fingers or two thumbs, one from each
hand, but you’ll probably find that a single-handed pinch and un-pinch is
handier.
 To scroll: Flick or drag up, down, left, or right.
Maps and contacts
Maps and contacts go together like peanut butter and jelly. For example, if
you want to see a map of a contact’s street address, tap the little bookmark
icon in the search field, tap the Contacts button at the bottom of the screen,
and then tap the contact’s name.
Or type the first few letters of the contact’s name in the search field and then
tap the name in the list that automatically appears below the search field.
After you find a location by
typing an address into Maps, you
can add that location to one of
your contacts. Or you can create
a new contact with a location
you’ve found. To do either, tap
the location’s pushpin on the
map, and then tap the little > in a
blue circle to the right of the
location’s name or description,
as shown in Figure 12-2, to dis-
play its Info screen as shown in 
Figure 12-3.
Now tap either the Create New Contact button or the Add to Existing Contact
button on the Info screen. You’ll probably have to scroll to the bottom of the
Info screen to see these buttons (shown on the right in Figure 12-3).
You work with your contacts by tapping the Phone icon on your Home
screen, and then tapping the Contacts icon at the bottom of the Phone
screen.
You can also get driving directions from any location including a contact’s
address to any other location including another contact’s address. You’ll see
how to do that in the “Smart map tricks” section.

Timesaving map tools
Maps offers three tools that can save you from having to type the same loca-
tions over and over again. All three appear in the Bookmarks screen, which is
displayed when you tap the little blue bookmark icon on the right side of any
search field.
At the bottom of the screen you’ll find three buttons: Bookmarks, Recents,
and Contacts. Here’s the lowdown.
Bookmarks
Bookmarks in the Maps application work like bookmarks in Safari. When you
have a location you want to save as a bookmark so you can reuse it later
without typing a single character, tap the little > in a blue circle to the right of
its name or description to display the Info screen for that location. Tap the
Add to Bookmarks button on the Info screen. (You’ll probably have to scroll
down the Info screen to see the Add to Bookmarks button.)
Once you add a location to your Bookmarks list, you can recall it at any time.
To do so, tap the bookmarks icon in any search field, tap the Bookmarks
button at the bottom of the screen, and then tap the bookmark name to see a
map of it.

The first things you should bookmark are your home and work address and
your zip codes. These are things you’ll be using all the time with Maps, so
you might as well bookmark them now to avoid typing them over and over.
Use zip code bookmarks to find nearby businesses. Choose the zip code
bookmark, and then type what you’re looking for, such as 78729 pizza, 
60645 gas station, or 90201 Starbucks.
To manage your bookmarks, first tap the Edit button in the top-left corner of
the Bookmarks screen. Then:
 To move a bookmark up or down in the Bookmarks list: Drag the little
icon with three gray bars that appears to the right of the bookmark
upward to move the bookmark higher in the list or downward to move
the bookmark lower in the list.
 To delete a bookmark from the Bookmarks list: Tap the minus sign to
the left of the bookmark’s name.
When you’re finished using bookmarks, tap the Done button in the top-right
corner of the Bookmarks screen to return to the map.
Recents
Maps automatically keeps track of every location you’ve searched for in its
Recents list. To see this list, tap the bookmarks icon in any search field, and
then tap the Recents button at the bottom of the screen. To see a map of a
recent item, tap the item’s name.
To clear the Recents list, tap the Clear button in the top-left corner of the
screen, and then tap the Clear All Recents button.
When you’re finished using the Recents list, tap the Done button in the top-
right corner of the screen to return to the map.
Contacts
To see a map of a contact’s location, tap the bookmarks icon in any search
field, and then tap the Contacts button at the bottom of the screen. To see a
map of a contact’s location, tap the contact’s name in the list.
To limit the Contacts list to specific groups (assuming you have some groups
in your Contacts list), tap the Groups button in the top-left corner of the
screen and then tap the name of the group. Now only contacts in this group
are displayed in the list.

When you’re finished using the Contacts list, tap the Done button in the top-
right corner of the screen to return to the map.
Smart map tricks
The Maps application has more tricks up its sleeve. Here are a few nifty fea-
tures you may find useful.
Get route maps and driving directions
You can get route maps and driving directions to any location from any loca-
tion in a couple of ways.
One way is to tap a pushpin on a map, and
then tap the little > in a blue circle to the
right of the name or description to display
the item’s Info screen, as shown in Figures
12-2 and 12-3. Now tap the Directions to
Here or Directions from Here button to 
get directions to or from that location,
respectively.
If you’re looking at a map screen, there’s
another way to get directions. Tap the little
up and down arrow icon at the bottom-left
corner of the map screen. The Start and End
fields appear at the top of the screen.
Type the starting and ending points, as
shown in Figure 12-4 (or choose them from
your bookmarks, recent maps, or contacts if
you prefer). If you want to swap the starting
and ending locations, tap the little swirly
arrow button to the left of the Start and End
fields.
When the start and end locations are cor-
rect, tap the Route button in the bottom-
right corner of the screen and the route
map appears, as shown in Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-4: Type a starting and 
ending location.

If you need to change the start or end location, tap the Edit button in the top-
left corner. If everything looks right, tap the Start button in the top-right
corner to receive turn-by-turn driving directions, as shown in Figure 12-6.
When you’re finished with the step-by-step directions, tap the little up and
down arrows icon in the bottom-left corner to return to the regular map
screen.

start and end locations shown in 
by-step driving directions for the 
Figure 12-4.
route shown in Figure 12-5.
Get traffic info in real time
You can find out the traffic conditions for whatever map you’re viewing by
tapping the little car icon in the bottom-right of the screen. When you do,
major roadways are color-coded to inform you of the current traffic speed.
Here’s the key:
141
Chapter 12: Monitoring Maps, Scrutinizing Stocks, and Watching Weather

142
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 Green: 50 or more miles per hour
 Yellow: 25–50 miles per hour
 Red: Under 25 miles per hour
 Gray: No data available at this time
Traffic info doesn’t work in every location, but the only way to find out is to
give it a try. If no color codes appear, assume that it doesn’t work for that
particular location.
More about the Info screen
If a location has a little > in a blue circle to the right of its name or description
(refer to Figure 12-2), you can tap it to see the location’s Info screen.
You’ve already seen that you can get directions to or from that location, add
the location to your bookmarks or contacts, or create a new contact from it,
but there are still two more things you can do with a location from its Info
screen:
 Tap its phone number to call it
 Tap its URL to launch Safari and view its Web site
Taking Stock with Stocks
Stocks is another Internet-enabled application on your iPhone. It’s a one-trick
pony, but if you need its trick — information about specific stocks — it’s a
winner.
Every time you open the Stocks application by tapping its icon on the Home
screen, it displays the latest price for your stocks, with two provisos:
 The quotes may be delayed by up to 20 minutes.
 The quotes are updated only if your iPhone can connect to the Internet
via either Wi-Fi or the AT&T EDGE data network.
So tap that Stocks icon and let’s take a peek.

The first time you open Stocks you’ll see information for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (^DJI), Apple (APPL), Google (GOOG), Yahoo (YHOO), and
AT&T (T). Because the chances of you owning that exact group of stocks are
slim, let’s look at how you can add your own stocks and delete any or all of
the default stocks.
Here’s how to add a stock:
1. Tap the i button in the bottom-right corner of the initial Stocks screen.
The i is for info.
2. Tap the + button in the top-
left corner of the Stocks
screen.
3. Type a stock symbol, or a
company, index, or fund
name.
4. Tap the Search button.
Stocks finds the company or
companies that match your
search request. 
5. Tap the one you want to add.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until
you’re through adding stocks.
In Figure 12-7, we added John
Wiley & Sons (JW-A).
6. Tap the Done button in the
top-right corner.
And here’s how to delete a stock:
1. Tap the i button in the
bottom-right corner of the 
initial Stocks screen.
2. Tap the – button to the left of the stock’s name.
3. Tap the Delete button that appears to the right of the stock’s name.
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until all unwanted stocks have been deleted.
4. Tap the Done button.

That’s all there is to adding and deleting stocks.
Here are a few more things you can do with Stocks. By default, Stocks dis-
plays the change in a stock’s price in dollars. You can see the change
expressed as a percentage in two ways. The easy way is to tap the number
next to any stock (green numbers are positive; red numbers are negative).
That toggles the display for all stocks. So if they’re currently displayed as dol-
lars, tapping any one of them switches them to percent and vice versa.
The second way accomplishes the same
thing, but takes more steps. Tap the i
button in the bottom-right corner of the ini-
tial Stocks screen. Tap the % or Numbers
button at the bottom of the screen. The
numbers are displayed in the manner you
choose. Tap the Done button in the top-
right corner.
Now refer back to Figure 12-7 and note the
chart at the bottom of the window. At the
top of the chart, you see a bunch of num-
bers and letters, namely 1d, 1w, 1m, 3m,
6m, 1y, and 2y. They are buttons you can
tap to change the time period shown on the
chart. They stand for 1 day, 1 week, 1
month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2
years, respectively. Tap one of them and
the chart reflects that period of time.
Finally, to look up additional information
about a stock at Yahoo.com, first tap the
stock’s name to select it, and then tap the
Y! button in the lower-left corner of the
screen. Safari launches and displays the
Yahoo.com finance page for that stock, as
shown in Figure 12-8.
Figure 12-8: The Yahoo.com finance
page for Apple (APPL).

Weather Watching
Weather is a simple application that provides you with the current weather
forecast for the city or cities of your choice. By default you see a six-day fore-
cast for the chosen city, as shown in Figure 12-9.
If the background for the forecast is blue, as
shown in Figure 12-9, it’s daytime (between
6 a.m. and 6 p.m.) in that city; if it’s a deep
purple, it’s nighttime (between 6 p.m. and 
6 a.m.).
To add a city, first tap the i button in the
bottom-right corner. Tap the + button in the
upper-left corner and then type a city and
state or zip code. Tap the Search button in
the bottom-right corner of the screen. Tap
the name of the found city. Add as many
cities as you want this way.
To delete a city, tap the i button in the
bottom-right corner. Tap the red – button to
the left of its name, and then tap the Delete
button that appears to the right of its name.
You can also choose between Fahrenheit
and Celsius on this screen by tapping either
the °F or °C button near the bottom of the
screen.
When you’re finished, tap the Done button
in the top-right corner of the screen.
If you have added more than one city to Weather, you can switch between
them by flicking your finger across the screen to the left or the right.
See the seven little dots — one white and six gray — at the bottom of the
screen in Figure 12-9? They denote the number of stored cities (which is
seven in the figure).

Last but not least, to see detailed weather information about a city at
Yahoo.com, tap the Y! button in the lower-left corner of the screen. Safari
launches and displays the Yahoo.com weather page for the current city, as
shown in Figure 12-10.

T
his part is where we show you what’s under
the hood and how to conﬁgure your iPhone to
your liking. Then we look at the things to do if
your iPhone ever becomes recalcitrant. 
In Chapter 13 we explore every single iPhone set-
ting that’s not discussed in depth elsewhere in the
book. iPhone offers dozens of different preferences
and settings you can customize to make your
iPhone your very own; by the time you ﬁnish with
Chapter 13, you’ll know how to customize every
part of your iPhone that can be customized. 
iPhones are well-behaved little beasts for the most
part, except when they’re not. Like the little girl
with the little curl, when they’re good they’re very
very good, but when they’re bad they’re horrid. 
So Chapter 14 is your comprehensive guide to 
troubleshooting for the iPhone. It details what to
do when almost anything goes wrong, offering
step-by-step instructions for speciﬁc situations as
well as a plethora of tips and techniques you can
try if something else goes awry. You may never
need Chapter 14 (and we hope you won’t), but
you’ll be very glad we put it here if your iPhone
ever goes wonky on you.

re you a control freak? The type of person who must have it your way?
Boy have you have landed in the right chapter.
Throughout this book we’ve had an occasion to drop in on Settings, kind of
the makeover factory for the iPhone. For example, we’ve come to
Settings (by tapping its Home screen icon) to set ringtones,
change the phone’s background or wallpaper, and specify
Google or Yahoo! as the search engine of choice. We’ve
also altered security settings in Safari and tailored
e-mail to our liking, among other modifications.
Note: Settings on the iPhone is roughly analogous to
the Control Panel in Windows and System Prefer-
ences on a Mac.
Because we’ve covered some settings elsewhere, we
won’t dwell on every setting here. But there’s plenty
still to discover to help you make the iPhone your own.

Sky-High Settings
When you first arrive in Settings you see the scrollable list shown in Fig-
ure 13-1. In all but airplane mode at the very top of the list, a greater than
symbol (>) appears to the right of each listing. That tells you that the listing
has a bunch of options. You tap the > symbol throughout this chapter to
check out those options.
Figure 13-1: Presenting your list of Settings.
Airplane mode
Using a cell phone on an airplane is a no-no. But there’s nothing verboten
about using an iPod on a plane to listen to music, watch videos, and peek at
pictures. At least once you’ve reached cruising altitude.

So how do you take advantage of the iPhone’s built-in iPod (among other
capabilities) while temporarily turning off its phone, e-mail, and Internet func-
tions? By turning on airplane mode.
To do so, merely tap Airplane Mode on the Settings screen so that On rather
than Off is displayed.
That act disables each of the iPhone’s wireless radios: Wi-Fi, cell phone, and
Bluetooth. While in airplane mode, you won’t be able to make or receive
calls, surf the Web, watch YouTube, or do anything else that requires an
Internet connection. The good news is that airplane mode will keep your bat-
tery running longer — particularly useful if the flight you’re on is taking you
halfway around the world.
The appearance of a tiny airplane
icon in the status bar at the upper
left reminds you that airplane mode
is turned on. Just remember to turn it
off when you’re back on the ground.
If you plug the iPhone into an iPod
accessory that isn’t necessarily com-
patible because of possible interfer-
ence from the iPhone’s wireless
radios, it offers to turn on airplane
mode for you, as the message dis-
played in Figure 13-2 indicates.
Wi-Fi
As previously discussed, Wi-Fi is one of the two wireless networks you can
use to surf the Web, send e-mail, and so on. It’s faster than AT&T’s EDGE data
network, your other path to the Internet on the iPhone.
You use the Wi-Fi setting to determine which Wi-Fi networks are available to
you and which one to exploit based on its signal.
Tap Wi-Fi and all Wi-Fi networks in range are displayed, as shown in Figure 13-3.
(Alternatively, you can reach this screen by tapping the General setting, tap-
ping Network, and then tapping Wi-Fi.)

Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings

152
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
A signal strength indicator can help you
choose the network to connect to if more
than one is listed; tap the appropriate Wi-Fi
network when you’ve reached a decision. If
a network is password-protected, you’ll see
a lock icon.
You can also turn the Ask to Join Networks
setting on or off. Networks that the iPhone
is already familiar with are joined automati-
cally regardless of which you choose. If the
Ask feature is on, you are asked before join-
ing a new network. If off, you have to manu-
ally select a network.
If you no longer want the iPhone to join a
particular network you’ve used before
automatically, tap the > symbol next to the
network in question within Wi-Fi settings
and then tap Forget This Network. The
iPhone develops a quick case of amnesia.
In some instances you have to supply other
technical information about a network you
hope to glom onto. You’ll encounter a
bunch of nasty sounding terms: DHCP, Boot
IP, Static, IP Address, Subnet Mask, Router,
DNS, Search Domains, Client ID, and HTTP Proxy. Chances are that none of
this info is at the tip of your tongue, and that’s okay. For one thing, most of
you will never need to know this stuff. What’s more, even if you do have to fill
in or adjust these settings, a network administrator or techie friend can prob-
ably help you out.
Sometimes you may want to connect to a network that is closed and not
shown on the Wi-Fi list. If so, tap Other and use the keyboard to enter the net-
work name. Then tap to choose the type of security setting the network is
using (if any). Your choices are WEP Password, WEP hex or ASCII, WPA, and
WPA2. Again, not exactly the friendliest terminology, but we hope someone
nearby can provide assistance.
If no Wi-Fi network is available, you have to rely on EDGE. If that’s not avail-
able either, you won’t be able rocket into cyberspace until you regain access
to a network.
Figure 13-3: Checking out your Wi-Fi
options.

Using Usage
Think of the Usage setting as one of the places to go on the iPhone for statis-
tics on how you actually employ the device. It’s not the only place to tap the
Settings screen for user stats; you get other information in the About setting
(under General on the Settings screen), described later in this chapter.
You can scroll up or down the Usage list to discover the following:
 The amount of time since you last fully charged your iPhone: This is
indicated in days and hours, both for the time when the iPhone has been
unlocked and used and when it’s been locked and in standby mode.
 Call time: Shown for the current period and the lifetime of the product.
 EDGE stats: The amount of network data you’ve sent and received over
EDGE. You can reset these statistics by tapping the Reset Statistics
button at the bottom of the screen.
Settings for Your Senses
The next set of settings have to do with what the iPhone looks like and
sounds like.
Sounds
Consider Sounds the iPhone’s sound stage. Here’s where you can turn audio
alerts on or off for a variety of functions: new voicemails, new text messages,
new mail, sent mail, and calendar alerts. This is also where you set ringtones
(as described in Chapter 4).
Other options: You can decide whether you want to hear lock sounds and
keyboard clicks. You can determine whether the iPhone should vibrate when
you get a call. And you can drag the volume slider to determine how loud
your ringer and alerts will be. 
There is an alternative: You can also use the physical Volume buttons on the
side of the iPhone for this purpose, provided you’re not already on a call or
using the iPod to listen to music or watch video.

Brightening up your day
Who doesn’t want a bright vibrant screen?
Alas, the brightest screens exact a tradeoff.
Before you drag the brightness slider
shown in Figure 13-4 to the max, remember
that brighter screens sap the life out of
your battery more quickly.
That’s why we recommend tapping the
Auto-Brightness control so that it is On. It
adjusts the screen according to the lighting
conditions around the iPhone while being
considerate to your battery.
Wallpaper
Choosing wallpaper is a neat way to dress
up the iPhone according to your taste. You
can sample the pretty patterns and designs
that the iPhone has already chosen for 
you by tapping the thumbnails shown in
Figure 13-5. Of course, although the Mona
Lisa is one of your choices, DaVinci has
nothing over the masterpieces in your own
photo albums (as described in Chapter 9).
After making a selection, tap the image and
then tap Set Wallpaper.
Figure 13-5: Choosing a masterpiece background.
Figure 13-4: Sliding this control
adjusts screen brightness.

In General
Certain miscellaneous settings are difficult to pigeonhole. Apple wisely
lumped these under the General settings moniker. Let’s take a look.
About About
You are not seeing double. This section is all about the setting known as
About. And About is full of trivial and not-so-trivial information about the
device. What you’ll find here:
 Name of your network.
 Number of songs stored on the device.
 Number of videos.
 Number of photos.
 Storage capacity used and available. Because of the way the device 
is formatted, you’ll always have a little less storage than the 4 or 
8 gigabytes of flash memory advertised.
 Software version. You probably think you own version 1.0 of the iPhone,
and in fact that’s so. But as the software gets tweaked and updated, 
your device goes a little beyond that 1.0 starting point. So in parenthe-
ses next to the version number, you’ll see something like 1A543a. That
(or another string of numbers and letters) is the build number of the
software version you have. It changes when the iPhone’s software is
updated.
 Serial and model numbers.
 Wi-Fi address.
 Bluetooth address. More on Bluetooth shortly.
 IMEI and ICCID. Say what? These stand for the International Mobile
Equipment Identity and Integrated Circuit Card Identifier (or Smart
Card) numbers. Hey, we warned you some of this was trivial.
 Modern firmware. The version of the cellular transmitter.
 Legal. You had to know that the lawyers would get their two cents in
somehow. All the fine print is here. And fine print it is. Although you can
flick to scroll through these lengthy legal notices, you can’t pinch the
screen to enlarge the text. Not that we can imagine more than a handful
of you will bother to read this legal mumbo-jumbo.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Date and time
In our neck of the woods, the time is reported as 11:32 PM or whatever time it
happens to be. But in some circles, it’s reported as 23:32. If you prefer the
latter format on the iPhone’s status bar, tap the 24-Hour Time setting (under
Date & Time) so that it is On.
This is just one of the settings you can adjust under Date & Time. You can
also have the iPhone set the time automatically using the time reported by
the cellular network (and adjusted for the time zone you are in).
If turned off, you’ll be asked to choose the time zone and set the date and
time manually. Here’s how:
1. Tap Set Automatically so that it is Off.
You see fields for setting the time zone and the date and time.
2. Tap the Time Zone field so that the current time zone and virtual key-
board are shown.
3. Tap out the letters of the city or country whose time zone you want to
enter until the one you have in mind appears. Then tap the name of
that city or country.
The Time Zone is automatically filled in for that city.
4. Tap the Set Date & Time field so that the time is shown. Then roll the
bicycle lock–like controls until the proper time is displayed.
5. Tap the date shown so that the bicycle lock–like controls pop up for
the date. Then roll the wheels for the month, day, and year until the
correct date appears.
6. Tap the Date & Time button to return to main Date & Time settings
screen.
The last set of date and time controls concern your calendar. You get to
choose whether to turn the Time Zone Support feature on or off. If on, the
events in your calendar are displayed according to the time zone you
selected for your calendar. If off, those entries are displayed according to
your current whereabouts.
Auto-lock
You can set the amount of time before the phone automatically locks or turns
off the display. Your choices are five minutes before, four minutes before, and
so on all the way down to one minute. Or you can set it so that the iPhone
never locks automatically.

Don’t worry if the iPhone is locked. You can still get calls and text messages
and adjust the volume.
Passcode
You can choose a passcode to prevent people from unlocking the phone. Tap
Passcode Lock. Then use the virtual keypad to enter a 4-digit code. During
this setup, you have to enter the code a second time before it is accepted.
You can change the passcode or turn it off later, but you need to know the
present passcode to apply any changes. If you forget the passcode, you have
to restore the iPhone’s software, as described in the next chapter.
FYI on VPN
A virtual private network, or VPN, is a way for you to securely access your
company’s network behind the firewall. The iPhone supports some VPN pro-
tocol configurations (pretty much the same ones as those on the Mac) and
we’re about to tell you their names, not that they’ll mean much to anyone
lacking network administration or IT credentials.
Here goes: The iPhone supports protocols known as L2TP (layer 2 tunneling
protocol) and PPTP (point-to-point tunneling protocol).
You get to these by tapping General, Network, VPN, and then Settings. Then
using configuration settings provided by your company, fill in the appropriate
server information, account, password, encryption level (if appropriate), and
so on. Better yet, lend your iPhone to the techies at the place you work and
let them fill in the blanks on your behalf.
Once configured, you can turn VPN on or off by tapping the VPN On or Off
switch inside Settings.
Brushing up on Bluetooth
Of all the peculiar terms you may encounter in techdom, Bluetooth is one of
our favorites. The name is derived from a tenth-century Viking king named
Harald Blatand, who, the story goes, helped unite warring factions. (And
Bluetooth is all about collaboration between different types of devices, get
it?) We’re told Blatand translates to Bluetooth in English.
157
Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings

158
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Blatand was obviously ahead of his time, though we can’t imagine he ever
dialed a cell phone. But today he has an entire short-range wireless technol-
ogy named in his honor. On the iPhone, you can use Bluetooth to communi-
cate wirelessly with a compatible Bluetooth headset or hands-free car kit.
Such optional headsets and kits are made by Apple and others.
To ensure that the iPhone works with one of these devices, they have to be
coupled, or paired. With the optional iPhone Bluetooth headset that Apple
sells, you can automatically pair the devices by placing the iPhone and head-
set into a dual dock (supplied with the headset), which you connect to your
computer.
If you’re using a third-party accessory, follow the instructions that came with
that headset or car kit so that it becomes discoverable, or ready to be paired
with your iPhone Then turn on Bluetooth under General on the Settings
screen so that the iPhone can find such
nearby devices, and the device can find the
iPhone. Bluetooth works up to a range of
about 30 feet.
You’ll know Bluetooth is turned on when
you see the Bluetooth icon in the status bar.
If the symbol is blue or black, the iPhone is
communicating wirelessly with a connected
device. If it is gray, Bluetooth is turned on in
the iPhone but a paired device is not nearby
or on.
To unpair a device, select it from the device
list shown in Figure 13-6 and tap Unpair.
As of this writing, Bluetooth on the iPhone
was limited compared to the Bluetooth
capabilities of some other devices. It does
not work with stereo Bluetooth headsets.
You can’t use Bluetooth to exchange files or
sync with a computer wirelessly. Nor can
you use it to print stuff from the iPhone
through a Bluetooth printer. That’s because
the iPhone does not support any of the
Bluetooth profiles required to allow such
wireless stunts to take place.
Figure 13-6: Falling out of love.
Unpairing devices.

Keyboard
You can do two main things under Keyboard settings. You can turn Auto-
Capitalization on or off and turn Enable Caps Lock on or off.
Auto-capitalization, which the iPhone turns on by default, means that the first
letter of the first word you type after ending a previous sentence with a
period, question mark, or exclamation point will be capitalized.
If Cap Locks is enabled, all letters will be uppercased LIKE THIS if you double-
tap the shift key. The shift key is the one with the arrow pointing north.
Reset
As little kids playing sports, we’d end an argument by agreeing to a “do-over.”
Well the Reset settings on the iPhone are one big do-over. Now that we’re
(presumably) grown up, think long and hard about the consequences before
implementing do-over settings. That said, you may encounter good reasons
for starting over; some of these are addressed in the troubleshooting chapter
following this one.
Here are your reset options:
 Reset All Settings: Tapping here resets all settings, but no data or media
is deleted.
 Erase All Content and Settings: This resets all settings and wipes out all
your data.
 Reset Dictionary: As we pointed out early on, the iPhone’s keyboard is
intelligent. And part of the reason it’s so smart is that it learns from you.
So when you reject words that the iPhone keyboard suggests, it figures
the words you specifically banged out ought to be added to the key-
board dictionary. Tapping Reset here removes those added words from
the dictionary.
 Reset Network Settings: This deletes the current network settings and
restores them to their factory defaults.
Phoning In More Settings
We’ve already covered most of the remaining settings in previous chapters
devoted to the iPod (photos and music), Safari, and e-mail.
159
Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings

160
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
But way back in Chapter 4, we tipped our hand and indicated that we’d save
a few more phone tricks — those found in Phone settings — for this chapter.
So tap Phone now to review some of the choices we didn’t get to previously.
Be aware you’ll have to scroll down the screen to find Phone settings.
Sorting and displaying contacts
Do you think of us as Ed and Bob or Baig and LeVitus? The answer to that
question will probably determine whether you choose to sort your Contacts
list alphabetically by last name or first.
Tap Sort Contacts, and then tap either Last, First or First, Last. Tap the Phone
button to return to the main Phone settings screen.
You can also determine whether you want to display a first name or last
name first. Tap Display Contacts and then choose First, Last or Last, First.
Tap the phone button when you are finished.
Call forwarding
If you expect to spend time in an area with poor cell phone coverage or none
at all, you may want to temporarily forward calls to a landline or other
portable handset. Here are the simple steps:
1. On the Settings screen, tap Phone and then tap Call Forwarding.
2. Tap to turn on Call Forwarding.
3. Use the virtual keypad to enter the number where you want incoming
calls to ring.
4. Tap the Call Forwarding button to return to the main Call Forwarding
screen.
To change the forwarding number, tap the circle with the x in the phone
number field to get rid of the old number, and then enter a new one.
Remember to turn off Call Forwarding to receive calls directly on your iPhone
again.
You must have cellular coverage while setting the call forwarding feature.

Call waiting
Tap the Call Waiting button to turn the feature on or off. If Call Waiting is off
and you are speaking on the phone, the call is automatically dispatched to
voicemail.
Displaying Caller ID
Don’t want your name or number displayed on the phone you are calling?
Make sure to tap Show My Caller ID so it is Off. If privacy isn’t a concern, you
can leave this setting On.
TTY
Folks who are hearing impaired sometimes rely on a teletype, or TTY
machine, to hold conversations. You can use the iPhone with standard TTY
devices by plugging a cable from the TTY device to an optional $19 iPhone
TTY adapter and then plugging the adapter into the iPhone. Make sure the
TTY setting on the phone is turned On.
Locking your SIM
The tiny SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card inside your iPhone holds
your phone number and other important data. Tap to turn on SIM PIN and
enter a password with the keypad. That way, if someone gets hold of your
SIM, he or she can’t use it in another phone without the password. Be aware
that if you assign a PIN to your SIM, you have to enter it to turn the iPhone off
and on again.
AT&T Services
There’s a major difference between the iPhone and all the other Apple prod-
ucts you might buy. That’s because you are entering into a relationship not
only with Apple but also with the phone company. Tap AT&T Services and
then tap any of the following for a shortcut phone call to
 Check Bill Balance: The phone dials *225# and, if all goes according to
plan, you receive a text message with the due date and sum owed, as
shown in Figure 13-7. Such text messages are not counted against your
messaging allotment.
161
Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings

162
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 Call Directory Assistance: The phone
dials 411.
 Pay My Bill: The iPhone dials *729 and
you are connected to an automated
voice system. You can pay your bill
with a checking account, debit card, or
credit card by following the voice
prompts.
It’s important to note that you are
billed for phone service from AT&T, not
Apple. Of course any music or other
content purchased in iTunes from your
computer is paid to Apple, as with any
iPod.
 View My Minutes: This time *646# is
called. You again receive a text reply
that doesn’t count against your mes-
saging allotment.
 Voice Connect: The iPhone dials *08 to
connect you to automated news,
weather, sports, quotes, and more. Just
bark out the kind of information you’re
looking for, such as “finance,” and
follow voice prompts for stock quotes,
business news, and so on. Or say
“sports” and follow voice prompts to
get the latest scores from your favorite team.
Not all AT&T Services make a phone call. If you tap the AT&T MyAccount
button, Safari opens an AT&T account management page on the Web.
We trust that you control freaks are satisfied with all the stuff you can
manage inside Settings. Still, the iPhone may not always behave as you want.
For the times when things get out of control, we highly recommend the next
chapter.

n our experience, iPhones are usually reliable devices. And most users
we’ve talked to have reported trouble-free operation. Notice our use of the
word most. That’s because every so often, a good iPhone goes bad — but it’s
not a common occurrence. So in this chapter we look at all the types of bad
things that can happen: problems with the phone itself; problems making 
or receiving calls; issues with wireless networks; and trouble with 
synchronization, computers (both Mac and PC), or iTunes.
After all the troubleshooting, we tell you how to get even
more help if nothing we’ve suggested does the trick.
And finally, if your iPhone is so badly hosed that it
needs to go back to the mothership for repairs, we
offer ways to survive the experience with a mini-
mum of stress or fuss.
iPhone Issues
Our first category of troubleshooting techniques applies
to an iPhone that is frozen or otherwise acting up. The
recommended procedure when this happens is to perform
the six R’s in sequence. What are the six R’s? Glad you asked.

So if your iPhone acts up on you — if it freezes, won’t wake up from sleep,
won’t do something it used to do, or in any other way acts improperly — this
section describes the things you should try in the order we (and Apple) rec-
ommend you try them.
If the first technique doesn’t do the trick, go on to the second. If the second
one doesn’t work, try the third. And so on.
Recharge
If your iPhone acts up in any way, shape, or form, the first thing you should
try is to give its battery a full recharge.
Don’t plug the iPhone’s dock connector–to–USB cable into a USB port on
your keyboard, monitor, or USB hub. You need to plug it into one of the USB
ports on your computer itself because USB ports on your computer supply
more power than the other ports.
You can use the included USB power adapter to recharge your iPhone from
an AC outlet rather than from a computer.
Restart
If you recharge your iPhone and it still misbehaves, the next thing to try is
restarting it. Just as restarting a computer often fixes problems, restarting
your iPhone sometimes works wonders.
To do so:
1. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button.
2. Slide the red slider to turn the iPhone off, and then wait a few 
seconds.
3. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button again until the Apple logo
appears on the screen.
4. If your iPod is still frozen, misbehaves, or doesn’t start, press and
hold the Home button for 6 to 10 seconds to force any frozen applica-
tions to quit, and then perform Steps 1 to 3 again.

If this doesn’t get your iPhone back up and running, move on to the third R,
resetting your iPhone.
Reset your iPhone
To reset your iPhone, merely press and hold the Sleep/Wake button while you
press the Home button on the front. When you see the Apple logo, release
both buttons.
Resetting your iPhone is like forcing your computer to restart after a crash.
Your data shouldn’t be affected by a reset and in many cases it will cure
whatever was ailing your iPhone. So don’t be shy about giving this technique
a try. In many cases, your iPhone will be back to normal after you’ve reset it
this way.
Unfortunately, sometimes resetting doesn’t do the trick. When that’s the case,
you have to take stronger measures.
Remove content
Up to now, nothing you’ve done should have taken more than a minute or
two. We hate to tell you, but this is about to change. Because the next thing
you should try is removing some or all of your data to see whether perhaps
it’s the cause of your troubles.
To do so, you’ll need to sync your iPhone and reconfigure it so that some or
all of your files are not synchronized (which will remove them from the
phone). The problem could be contacts, calendar data, songs, photos,
videos, or podcasts. If you suspect a particular data type — for example, you
suspect your photos because whenever you tap the Photos icon on the Home
screen your iPhone freezes — try removing that data first.
Or, if you have no suspicions, uncheck every item and sync. When you’re fin-
ished your iPhone should have no data on it.
If that fixed it, try restoring your data one type at a time. If the problem
returns, you have to keep experimenting to determine which particular data
type or file is causing the problem.
If you’re still having problems, the next step is to reset your iPhone’s settings.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Reset settings and content
This is actually two steps: The first one, resetting your iPhone settings, resets
every iPhone setting to its default — the way it was when you took it out of
the box. Resetting the iPhone’s settings doesn’t erase any of your data or
media. The only downside is that you may have to go back and change some
settings afterwards. So this is a step you can try without trepidation. To do it,
tap the Settings icon on your Home screen, and then tap General, Reset, and
Reset All Settings.
Be careful not to tap Erase All Content and Settings, at least not yet. Erasing
all content takes more time to recover from (because your next sync takes a
long time), so you should try Reset All Settings first.
Now, if resetting all settings didn’t cure your iPhone, you have to try Erase All
Content and Settings. You’ll find it in the same place as Reset All Settings 
(tap Settings, General, Reset).
This will delete everything from your iPhone — all of your data, media, and
settings. Because all of these things are stored on your computer, at least in
theory, you should be able to put things back the way they were with your
next sync. But you will lose any photos you’ve taken, as well as contacts, 
calendar events, and On-the-Go playlists you’ve created or modified since
your last sync.
After using Erase All Content and Settings, check to see whether your iPhone
works properly. If it doesn’t cure what ails your iPhone, the final R is restor-
ing your iPhone using iTunes.
Restore
Before you give up the ghost on your poor, sick iPhone, you can try one more
thing. Connect your iPhone to your computer as though you were about to
sync. But when the iPhone appears in the iTunes source list, click the Restore
button on the Summary tab. This will erase all of your data and media, and
reset all of your settings as well.
Because all of your data and media still exists on your computer (except
photos you’ve taken, and contacts, calendar events, and On-the-Go playlists
you’ve created or modified since your last sync, as noted previously), you
shouldn’t lose anything by restoring. Your next sync will take longer than
usual, and you may have to reset settings you’ve changed since you got your
iPhone. But other than those inconveniences, restoring shouldn’t cause you
any additional trouble.

Okay. So that’s the gamut of things you can do when your iPhone acts up. If
none of this worked, skim through the rest of the chapter to see whether any-
thing else we recommend looks like it might help. If not, your iPhone proba-
bly needs to go into the shop for repairs.
Never fear, gentle reader. Be sure and read the last section in this chapter, “If
Nothing We Suggested Worked.” Your iPhone may be very sick, but we’ll help
ease the pain by sharing some tips on how to minimize the discomfort.
Problems with Calling or Networks
If you’re having problems making or receiving calls, problems sending or
receiving SMS text messages, or problems with Wi-Fi or AT&T’s EDGE data 
network, this section may help. The techniques here are short and sweet —
except for the last one, restore. Restore, which we described in the previous
section, is still inconvenient and time consuming, and it still entails erasing
all of your data and media and then restoring it.
But first, here are some simple steps that may help. Once again, we suggest
you try them in this order (and so does Apple).
1. Check the cell signal icon in the top-left corner of the screen.
If you don’t have at least one or two bars, you may not be able to use the
phone or SMS text message function.
2. Make sure you haven’t left your iPhone in airplane mode, as
described in the Chapter 13.
In airplane mode, all network-dependent features are disabled, so you
can’t make or receive phone calls, send or receive SMS text messages, 
or use any of the applications that require a Wi-Fi or EDGE network 
connection (that is, Mail, Safari, Stocks, Maps, and Weather).
3. Try moving around.
Changing your location by as little as a few feet can sometimes mean the
difference between four bars and zero bars, or being able to use the
EDGE data network or not. If you’re inside, try going outside. If you’re
outside, try moving ten or twenty paces in any direction. Keep an eye on
the cell signal icon as you move around and stop when you see more
bars than you saw before.
167
Chapter 14: When Good iPhones Go Bad

168
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
4. Turn airplane mode on by tapping Settings on the Home screen and
then tapping the Airplane Mode On/Off switch to turn it on. Wait 15
or 20 seconds and then turn it off again.
Toggling airplane mode on and off like this resets both the Wi-Fi and
EDGE wireless connections. So if your network connection was the prob-
lem, toggling airplane mode on and off may very well correct it.
5. Restart your iPhone.
If you’ve forgotten how, refer to
the “Restart” section a few
pages back. As we mentioned,
restarting your iPhone is often
all it takes to fix whatever was
wrong.
6. Make sure your SIM card is
firmly seated.
A SIM (Subscriber Identity
Module) card is a removable
smart card used to identify
mobile phones. It allows users
to change phones by moving
the SIM card from one phone to
another.
To remove the SIM card, find a
very fine gauge paper clip,
straighten one end, and then
stick the straight end gently
into the hole on the SIM tray, as
shown in Figure 14-1.
When the SIM tray slides out,
carefully lift out the SIM card and then reinsert it, making sure it’s firmly
situated in the tray before you gently push the tray back in until it locks.
If none of the preceding fixed your network issues, try restoring your iPhone
as described previously in the “Restore” section.
Performing a restore deletes everything on your iPhone — all of your data,
media, and settings. You should be able to put things back the way they were
with your next sync. If that doesn’t happen for whatever reason, you can’t
say we didn’t warn you.
Figure 14-1: Removing the SIM tray.

Sync, Computer, or iTunes Issues
Our last category of troubleshooting techniques applies to issues that
involve synchronization and computer/iPhone relations. If you’re having
problems syncing or your computer doesn’t recognize your iPhone when you
connect it, here are some things to try.
Once again we suggest that you try these procedures in the order they’re pre-
sented here.
1. Recharge your iPhone.
If you didn’t try it previously, try it now. Go back to the “iPhone Issues”
section at the beginning of the chapter and read what we said about
recharging your iPhone. Every word there also applies here.
2. Try a different USB port or a different cable if you have one available.
It doesn’t happen often, but occasionally USB ports and cables go bad.
When they do, it invariably causes sync and connection problems. So
it’s always a good idea to make sure that a bad USB port or cable isn’t to
blame.
If you don’t remember what we’ve said about using USB ports on your
computer rather than the ones on your keyboard, monitor, or hub, we
suggest you reread the “Recharge” section, earlier in the chapter.
3. Restart your iPhone and try to sync again.
We describe restarting in full and loving detail in the “Restart” section,
earlier in the chapter.
4. Reinstall iTunes.
Even if you have an iTunes installer handy, it’s probably a good idea to
visit the Apple Web site and download the latest and greatest version,
just in case. You’ll always find the latest version of iTunes at www.
apple.com/itunes/download/.
More Help on the Apple Web Site
If you’ve tried everything suggested so far and are still having problems,
don’t give up just yet. Here are a few more places you may find help. We 
recommend that you check out some or all of them before you throw in the
towel and smash your iPhone into tiny little pieces (or ship it back to Apple
for repairs, as described in the next section).
169
Chapter 14: When Good iPhones Go Bad

170
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
First, Apple offers an excellent set of support resources on its Web site at
www.apple.com/support/iphone. You can browse support issues by cate-
gory, search for a problem by keyword, or use the iPhone Troubleshooting
Assistant to resolve common problems, as shown in Figure 14-2.
We wouldn’t put a
lot of hope in the
Troubleshooting
Assistant. If you’ve
tried everything
we’ve suggested in
this chapter, you’ve
probably tried
everything the
Troubleshooting
Assistant will sug-
gest. However, since
it’s easier to update
a Web site than it is
to update a book,
the Troubleshooting
Assistant could
offer techniques we
didn’t know when
we wrote this. So
although it may just
repeat things you
already know, it
could also have something new. Give it a try.
While you’re visiting the Apple support pages, another section could be helpful:
the discussion forums. You’ll find them at http://discussions.apple.com,
and they’re chock full of questions and answers from other iPhone users. It’s
been our experience that if you can’t find an answer to a support question
elsewhere, you can often find something helpful in these forums. You can
browse by category, as shown in Figure 14-3, or search by keyword.
Either way, you’ll find thousands of discussions about almost every aspect of
using your iPhone. Better still, you’ll frequently find the answer to your ques-
tion or a helpful suggestion, as shown in Figure 14-4.
Figure 14-2: Apple’s iPhone support pages offer several kinds of
helpful information.

Figure 14-3: Page 1 of 58 pages of discussions about integrating the iPhone into your 
digital life.
Now for the best part. If you can’t find a solution by browsing or searching,
you can post your question in the appropriate Apple discussion forum. Check
back in a few days (or even a few hours) and some helpful iPhone user may
very well have replied with the answer. If you’ve never tried this fabulous
tool, you’re missing out on one of the greatest support resources available
anywhere.
Last, but certainly not least, before you give up the ghost you might want to
try a carefully worded Google search. It couldn’t hurt and you might just find
the solution you’ve spent hours searching for.

Figure 14-4: A typical discussion in an iPhone discussion forum.
If Nothing We Suggested So Far Helped
If you’ve tried every trick in the book (this one) and still have a malfunction-
ing iPhone, it’s time to consider shipping it off to the iPhone hospital (better
known as Apple, Inc.). The repair will be free if your iPhone is still under its
one-year limited warranty.

You can extend your warranty to up to two years from the original purchase
date if you want. To do so, you need to buy the AppleCare Protection Plan for
your iPhone. You don’t have to do it when you buy the phone, but you must
buy it before your one-year limited warranty expires. The cost is $69.
Here are a few things you should know before you take your phone in to be
repaired:
 Your iPhone will be erased during its repair, so you should sync your
iPhone with iTunes before you take it in if you can. If you can’t and
you’ve entered data on the phone since your last sync, such as a contact
or an appointment, the data won’t be there when you restore your
iPhone upon its return.
 Remove any third-party accessories such as a case or screen protector.
 Remove the SIM card from your iPhone (as described in the “Problems
with Calling or Networks” section) and keep it in a safe place.
Do not under any circumstances forget this step. Apple will not guaran-
tee that your SIM card will be returned to you after a repair. If you do
forget this step, Apple suggests that you contact your local AT&T store
and obtain a new SIM card with the proper account information. Ouch.
Although you may be able to get your iPhone serviced by AT&T or by mail,
we recommend that you take it to your nearest Apple Store for two reasons:
 No one knows your iPhone like Apple. One of the geniuses at the Apple
Store may be able to fix whatever is wrong without sending your iPhone
away for repairs.
 Only the Apple Store offers a loaner phone while yours is in for repairs.
It’s called the AppleCare Service Phone, and you can use one until your
iPhone comes back for just $29.
If you choose to borrow an AppleCare Service Phone, there’s no activation
required and the loaner will have the same phone number as the phone that’s
in the shop. Just pop your SIM card into the loaner and away you go.
You can sync your AppleCare Service Phone with iTunes on your computer to
fill it with the data and media files you had on your sick iPhone. When you
get your iPhone back after repairs, just reverse the process. Pop the SIM card
into it and sync it with iTunes on your computer and you’re good to go.

The Part of Tens

I
t’s written in stone somewhere at Wiley world
headquarters that we Dummies authors must
include a Part of Tens in every single Dummies
book we write. It is a duty we take quite seriously.
So in this part, you ﬁnd our wish list — all the
things we wish the iPhone had that it doesn’t (yet),
from being able to tap into a speedier cell phone
network to offering a swappable battery. Because
as infatuated as we are with the iPhone, we are
obliged to point out that it is less than perfect.
We then move on to our diverse collection of ten
fabulous Web resources every iPhone user should
know about. We tell you about online destinations
to practice typing on iPhone’s multitouch display,
calculate tips, and compile a shopping list. Even
your very fortune awaits you in these next few
pages.
We close the show with one of our favorite topics:
hints, tips, and shortcuts that make life with your
iPhone even better. Among the ten, you discover
how to look at the capacity of your newly-favored
device in different ways, ﬁnd out how to share
Web pages, and pick up another trick or two on
using iPhone’s virtual keyboard. (Ten points if you
can guess what these three photos have in
common.)

nquestionably, Apple deserves high praise for the
iPhone. It’s a fabulous device that breaks new
ground and will likely spur innovation in the entire cell
phone industry. We think that’s terrific.
But we wouldn’t be doing our jobs as journalists if
we didn’t point out shortcomings. As smitten as we
are over what is really a handheld computer more
than a cell phone, the fact is version 1.0 of the
iPhone isn’t flawless. Some features that we would
have wanted to see were left out, while others could
simply perform better.
In that spirit, we submit ten items for an iPhone wish list.
The good news is that Apple can beef up certain features 
and correct bugs through software upgrades. For example, 
Apple could upgrade the iPhone so that it can support Flash 
video, among other Internet standards.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
It’s possible that by the time you read this chapter, Apple or AT&T will have
addressed some of the things on our list.
But not all. So while we’re certainly not advising you to hold off buying an
iPhone if you haven’t purchased one yet, the truth is you won’t be punished
by waiting. The next iteration of the iPhone, and the one after that — when-
ever Apple gets around to introducing new models — will almost certainly be
better than their predecessors. Quite possibly cheaper too.
Hey, this is a chapter for wishful thinkers.
A Faster Network
If critics have consistently taken Apple to task on anything iPhone-related, it
is the too-often plodding EDGE data network run by partner AT&T. In Chapter
10, we describe how EDGE is not quite a true 3G, or third-generation, data
network.
AT&T is already working with faster networks than EDGE, even if those are
not nearly as ubiquitous today. They are based on technologies known as
UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone System) and HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink
Packet Access). Although AT&T claims typical speeds for EDGE of 75 to 135
kilobits per second, UMTS can deliver 220 to 320 kbps and HSDPA, 400 to 700
kbps. That puts the networks in the same ballpark as the broadband Internet
service you may be experiencing at home through a cable modem or DSL.
We can’t predict when the AT&T and Apple union will lead to a true 3G
iPhone. There are lingering issues. For one, too few potential customers have
access to these faster networks at the moment.
And Steve Jobs himself, while wishing for faster service, told the Wall Street
Journal that the early 3G chipsets were not “low-enough power” (affecting
battery life) and “took up too much physical space.”
In the meantime, there’s always Wi-Fi, if you happen to have access to a 
network.
Freedom of Choice
You are currently limited to using an iPhone with AT&T in the U.S., O2 in the
U.K., T-Mobile in Germany, and Orange in France. If you’d rather give your
business to another wireless carrier — well, you’re out of luck.

Now we have nothing against those four wireless operators per se. But when
it comes to cell phone carriers, we are decidedly pro-choice. Other smart-
phones are sold across multiple carriers. So why not the iPhone? Weíre
already wondering out loud if the agreement between the companies has a
loophole that would let Apple make iPhones available through other wireless
phone companies. Only time will tell.
iTunes Ringtones and Music Downloads
It would seem like a natural: using snippets of music from your iTunes library
for ringtones After all, one of the chief ways people personalize cell phones is
through ringtones. And with iTunes you have this fabulous stash of music.
Not so fast.
There’s no obvious technical reason stopping Apple from letting you pluck
ringtones from your very own iTunes collection. But certain issues need to be
resolved, such as the ever-sticky matter of digital rights and who owns what
songs for what purpose. And pricing; it’s astounding to us how much money
is spent on ringtones.
While you can’t convert songs in your iTunes Library into ringtones, you can
create your own custom 30-second ringtones from certain songs you pur-
chase from the iTunes Store (about 500,000 at this writing). Songs that can be
made into ringtones are designated by a little “bell” symbol in iTunes; click
the bell symbol to bring up iTunes’ ringtone editor. Alas, each ringtone costs
99 cents, even if you’ve purchased the same song previously. 
On a quasirelated topic, kudos to Apple for its recent introduction of the
iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, which lets you purchase and download music to
your iPhone and then sync it with your PC or Mac later. That said, you can
perform this magic only if you have access to a Wi-Fi network — it won’t
work when you’re connected via the EDGE cellular data network.
Furthermore, you can’t buy video this way, only audio.
So we have three wishes: 
1. To create ringtones from our own songs without paying for them
again.
2. To buy music over the EDGE cellular network.
3. To buy video content from our iPhones.
179
Chapter 15: Ten Things for the Wish List

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Games
Whether you are surfing the Web, listening to music, watching videos, or
composing e-mail, the iPhone gives you plenty of things to do while you’re
killing time commuting or waiting to board an airplane.
But the iPhone left out one diversion: the ability to play iPod games. Apple
already sells a bunch of games in iTunes for video iPods. You can find Sudoku
and Ms. Pac-Man to Tetris and Texas Hold ’em, most for $4.99 a pop. We don’t
see why these and other titles couldn’t be made available for the iPhone.
In all fairness, we have to admit that we’ve found many enjoyable Web-based
games to play on our iPhones, including the following:
 Diamenty: http://diamenty.myiphone.pl/
 Scenario Poker: http://iphone.scenario.com/
 Solitaire: http://www.iphone-solitaire.com/
 Brickshooter: http://www.brickshooter.com/online/?iphone
Although these online games may not be quite as polished as five dollar iPod
games, they have a distinct advantage: They’re all free.
The Ability to Use My Own Headphones
Not everyone likes the earbuds Apple supplies with its iPods and now the
iPhone. Some folks have trouble keeping them in their ears. Some want richer
sound. That’s why a lot of people purchase their own headphones. But
because of the way the headphone jack is recessed on the iPhone, not all of
those third-party headphones can be plugged in.
You can already purchase inexpensive adapters that will let you plug in your
headphones of choice. But some of these jut out awkwardly. We think an
accessible jack that is compatible with all popular headphones ought to be
standard on a future iPhone.
Of course, we’re also in favor of dispensing with the wires altogether and let-
ting you use state-of-the-art Bluetooth headphones instead. But the iPhone
doesn’t support Bluetooth stereo as of this writing.

A Built-in GPS
Don’t get us wrong — the Maps application built into the iPhone rocks. But
having experienced GPS-based navigation systems in our cars, we’d love to
see a next-generation iPhone with a built-in GPS (Global Positioning System).
GPS would offer at least two big advantages over the current Maps app:
 You wouldn’t need to know (or type) your current location. You’d open
the Maps application and it would know where you are.
 Your iPhone would know what street you are on and be able to issue and
update driving directions on-the-fly based on your current location.
Mobile devices with GPS are already available; it would be great to see it on
the iPhone.
More Storage
Another thing we’d love to see are iPhones with more than the current maxi-
mum of 8GB of storage. It’s not the end of the world having to pick and
choose which audio, video, and photo files to sync with your 8GB iPhone, but
it sure would be nice not to have to pick and choose at all.
For example, Bob’s iPod video contains almost 30GB of music, podcasts,
photos, and video. The size of Ed’s iPod media collection is roughly the same.
Nothing would be better than to have all of it available on our iPhones.
Who knows, maybe Apple will add a slot to a future iPhone for memory cards
that would let you bolster storage capacities — or build an iPhone with a
small hard drive.
Voice Dialing
Of all the things Apple left out of the iPhone, the lack of voice dialing puzzles
us. Most mobile phones have it. Mac OS X has superb voice recognition soft-
ware built into it. And unlike many mobile phones, the iPhone comes with a
reasonably high-quality microphone. So we were surprised to find that we
couldn’t voice dial with the iPhone.
181
Chapter 15: Ten Things for the Wish List

182
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
We’re both big fans of wireless Bluetooth headsets and have enjoyed using
them for voice dialing on our previous phones. Imagine you’re driving and
need to make a call. There’s no doubt that pulling out your phone, looking at
its screen, and choosing or dialing a number on it is dangerous — and possi-
bly illegal. With voice dialing, you leave the phone in your pocket. To make a
call, you just tap a button on your headset and say the person’s name. A few
seconds later, you’re connected to that person.
We’re going to go out on a limb and predict that Apple adds voice dialing
before the end of 2007 via a software update to the iPhone. You heard it here
first.
Removable Batteries
We both have iPhone battery rechargers in our homes, our offices, and our
cars. Even so, there are times when it would be more convenient to slap in a
fresh battery than hook the phone up to a power source for an hour or two.
Users would love it, and it would be another profitable accessory for Apple.
We expect that someday the iPhone will include removable batteries. As far
as we’re concerned, the sooner the better.
A Video Camera
The lack of a video camera also puzzles us. Many mobile phones shoot video.
Apple embeds a video camera in every notebook computer. And the iPhone is
one of the best handheld devices for watching video. So why can’t the
camera built into the iPhone shoot video?
We know the video quality would be nothing to write home about, but we’d
still love to shoot video with our iPhones.

Wi-Fi Hotspot Finder Extraordinaire
Sure, you can use the Maps application to
find a Wi-Fi hotspot in a pinch. Just tap
Maps, then type hotspot and the zip code
you want to search. Assuming that zip code
has some Wi-Fi hotspots, a map full of
pushpins appears.
But Maps doesn’t discern between free
hotspots and ones you have to pay for. And
Maps doesn’t offer a review of the hotspot’s
signal quality. And although Maps is plenty
easy to use, we know an ever better, easier
way. It’s called JiWire Wi-Fi Finder, which
has a clean, easy-to-use interface that
makes it easy to search for hotspots in
more than 150,000 locations in 135 coun-
tries. It also allows you to limit your search
to free hotspots, as shown in Figure 16-1.
After tapping the Go button, a list of hotspot
locations appears. Tap the name of a found
hotspot, and you see another screen with its
name, address, phone number, and three but-
tons: Call, Map, and Info. The Call and Map
buttons do what you’d expect: dial the phone
number and display the location in the Maps
application, respectively. But the Info button is the best; it tells you more about
the business and the quality of its wireless network, as shown in Figure 16-2.
It’s easy to use, it’s elegant, it does stuff Maps doesn’t, and best of all, it’s
free. How can you not love that? Go to http://iphone.jiwire.com.
Figure 16-2: Most hotspots have mini-reviews.
Figure 16-1: JiWire Wi-Fi Finder is a
better way to find Wi-Fi hotspots.

A Double-Threat for Everything iPhone
If you’re looking for a Web site that offers a little bit of almost everything an
iPhone user might want, look no further than iPhoneAppr. If you visit the site
on a Mac or a PC, you’ll see a full-scale Web site with news, chat forums,
applications, tutorials, and a blog, as shown in Figure 16-3.
But if you use your iPhone to visit the site, you get a streamlined interface
designed for the device that focuses on the latest and greatest applications
(that is, Web sites), as shown in Figure 16-4.

iPhoneAppr is updated several times a day
and always seems to have the scoop on the
latest and newest sites for the iPhone.
Several other sites have lists of iPhone
applications, but iPhoneAppr is slicker,
easier to use on both the computer and the
iPhone, and usually more timely than the
others.

Fast, Easy Shopping with
OneTrip Shopping List
No matter how good an iPhone typist you
are, we have a faster, easier way to make
shopping lists. It’s called OneTrip Shopping
List. Rather than typing items for a list, you
tap them. Here’s how it works. First, tap a
category. Then tap an item or items in the
category, as shown in Figure 16-5.
Figure 16-5: First tap a category (left), and then tap an item
or items in that category (right).
Figure 16-4: The iPhone look of
iPhoneAppr.

At the store, you tap the items as you toss them into your shopping cart, and
a check mark magically appears next to their name, as shown in Figure 16-6.
You can edit a list any time you like, and you can type any item not included in
one of the categories. And with another tap you can e-mail the list to yourself
or anyone you want.
OneTrip Shopping List has one last great feature — it’s free. Go to http://
onetrip.org/onetrip/.
Figure 16-6: A OneTrip Shopping List shopping list.
Calculating Tips Has Never Been Easier
Sure you can use the iPhone’s calculator to figure out how much of a tip to
leave, but using Danny Goodman’s Tip Calculator, at http://dannyg.com/
iphone/tipCalc, is a whole lot easier. Just tap the Food & Bevs or Tax field
and a numeric keypad pops up on the screen, as shown in Figure 16-7.
After you specify the number of diners and the amounts for food and tax, the
Tip Calculator does the rest, calculating the gratuity, total, and total amount
per diner, as shown in Figure 16-8.

diners and the amount of food, drink, 
and tax; the Tip Calculator does the
rest. 
If you tap the little i to the left of Gratuity you can even choose how the tip is
calculated — as a percent of the food and beverage total or as a multiple of
the sales tax.
Tip Calculator, like the other items in this chapter, is 100% free of charge,
leaving you extra cash to be a generous tipper.
Match Three Gems (Free)
Bejeweled, at www.popcap.com, is a free “match three gems” game you play
on your iPhone. If you’ve ever played Bejeweled on the Mac or the PC, it's the
same but designed for your iPhone.

For those unfamiliar with this enjoyable and addictive game, the goal is to
arrange three or more matching gems in a line either horizontally or verti-
cally. To move the gems, you tap one, and then tap any adjacent gem to swap
their places, as shown in Figure 16-9.
A swap occurs only if it will form a line of three or more matching gems. In
Figure 16-9, swapping the yellow and green gems creates a horizontal line of
three green gems as shown in Figure 16-10. The three green gems will then
disappear, the gems above them will slide downward to fill in the gaps, and
new gems fall from the top of the board to fill in any gaps.
The more lines of three or more gems you make, the higher your score. The
game ends when no more lines of three or more matching gems can be created.

three green gems will now disappear,

Practice Typing
By now you’ve probably done a fair share
of typing using the iPhone’s multitouch
keyboard. Some of you may still be strug-
gling with it. For others, let’s just say
you’re getting a tad cocky. “Look at me. I’m
hot stuff. This keyboard thing is really a
piece of cake.”
Think so? Why not put your skills to the
test? That’s what the iPhone Typing Test
site (http://www.iphonetypingtest.
com/) is all about. You can try your hand,
um, fingers at two types of tests.
In the first test, your goal is to type a sen-
tence as quickly and accurately as possi-
ble. The sentence appears in a yellow box
at the top of the screen. The test begins
when you tap inside the blue field just
below the yellow field. At that moment,
the sentence you are trying to match and
the virtual keyboard appear simultane-
ously, as Figure 16-11 shows.
When you are finished typing, tap Done to
see how you fared, as shown in Figure 16-12.
Are you still feeling cocky?
Figure 16-12: You get to see how fast you 
are — and accurate.
The second exam is a freestyle test in which you get to type anything you
want for as long as you want. When you tap Done, your words-per-minute are
calculated. Before leaving the site, check out the typing tips section.
Figure 16-11: Try to match the sentence
in the yellow field by typing in the blue
field.

An Instant Messaging Workaround
We were surprised that instant messaging was among the features Apple left
out when the iPhone was launched. Apple has long included a fine IM pro-
gram called iChat on Macs. And IM is a popular feature on some rival cell
phones.
Apple may well add a version of iChat on the iPhone, possibly even by the
time you read this. But if they haven’t gotten around to it yet, check out
JiveTalk from BeeJive (http://iphone.beejive.com/).
The site was still in an early alpha testing
stage as this book was being prepared, but
you could already head there and log onto
your existing AOL Instant Messenger (AIM),
Google Talk, ICQ, Jabber, MSN Messenger,
and Yahoo Messenger accounts.
It’s easy to set up these accounts so they’ll
work through JiveTalk. Tap the + button at
the JiveTalk home screen, and then tap the
downward arrow next to the Network field
to choose an IM network from the list that
appears at the bottom of the screen, as
shown in Figure 16-13. Tap Done and enter
your username and password. If you so
choose, tap the Save Account checkbox so
you don’t have to enter this information
every time you want to engage in an IM 
session.
You can log into all your IM accounts at the
same time. Your compadres across all your
accounts appear in one integrated buddy list
(shown in Figure 16-14); the little icon next
to a name indicates which IM account he or
she is associated with.
As Figure 16-15 shows, the virtual keyboard slides up from the bottom the
moment you tap the text box to type a message to a buddy. Per usual, the
keyboard offers suggestions if it thinks you mistyped a word (which, as we
discovered in the preceding section, does indeed happen). The actual IM
dialog appears in text bubbles.

looks like inside JiveTalk.
Through the JiveTalk’s settings, you can choose whether or not to display
offline buddies, show status messages, and display emoticons (smiley faces
and the like).
Wassup with Widgets?
Lots of sites can help you find iPhone widgets, those “lite” but useful mini
applications that range from a handy little version of the periodic table of the
elements to a cheap gas finder.
One of the most comprehensive widget finders we’ve come across is the
aptly named iPhone Widget List, at http://iphonewidgetlist.com/. 
Figure 16-16 shows what the site looks like.
Listed apps carry user ratings and status updates (the widget works, roughly
working, proof of concept, beta, and so on). You can also tap a See it Now
button to get a closer peek at the widget.

iPhone Network Speed Tester
Ever wonder if your Internet connection — Wi-Fi or EDGE — was faster or
slower than average? If so, you’re going to enjoy using the iPhone Network
Test at http://www.iphonenetworktest.com/. Just tap the Start Test link
on the front page, and after a few seconds your network speed appears, as
shown in Figure 16-17.
Kbps (kilobits per second) are a common measure of your data transfer rate.
A kilobit is 1000 bits, so one kilobit per second equals 1000 bits per second. 
If you tap the link for EDGE or Wi-Fi below the words “How are you connected
to the Internet,” your EDGE or Wi-Fi speed is recorded for posterity. Then, if
you tap the Results button that appears (and also appears on the front page
of the site), you see the average speeds for all network tests, all Wi-Fi tests,
and all EDGE tests, as shown in Figure 16-18.

for the average speed for all tests, all 
Wi-Fi tests, and all EDGE tests.
What can we discern from all this? Well, our Wi-Fi speed of 1541.5 kbps is
around 1.5 times the average Wi-Fi test speed. Put another way, this Wi-Fi
connection is pretty darn fast.
Read Your Fortune
“Your great attention to detail is both a blessing and a curse.” “It takes more
than good memory to have good memories.” “There is a true and sincere
friendship between you and your friends.”
Profound thoughts, huh?
We picked up these pearls of wisdom at iPhone Fortune Cookie 1.0, at
http://m.digitaljoven.com/fortune/index.html. When you first 
arrive at this amusing site, you see the fortune cookie shown at the top of
Figure 16-19. 

Figure 16-19: Your fortune is hidden inside this cookie until you rotate your iPhone 
sideways to break it in half.
Then when you rotate the phone to landscape mode, the cookie breaks in
half and your fortune is revealed, as shown in the figure on the bottom.
Repeat this little drill to request another fortune. Alas, some of the fortunes
are as stale as the cookies we’ve eaten in real Chinese restaurants. Samples:
“A pleasant surprise is in store for you.” “You will live a long, happy life.”
Guess that’s just the way the cookie crumbles. (Hey, we couldn’t help 
ourselves.)

Do the Slide for Accuracy 
and Punctuation
Here’s a tip that will help you type faster in two ways. First, it
will help you type more accurately; second, it will let you type
punctuation and numerals faster than ever before.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Over the course of this book you’ve found out how to tap, how to double-tap,
and even how to double-tap with two fingers. Now we want to introduce you
to a new gesture we like to call “the slide.”
To do the slide, you start by performing the first half of a tap. That is, you
touch your finger to the screen but don’t lift it up. Now, without lifting your
finger, slide it onto the key you want to type. You’ll know you’re on the right
key because it will pop up (enlarge).
First try it during normal typing. Stab at a key and if you miss, rather than lift-
ing off, backspacing, and trying again, do the slide onto the proper key. Once
you get the hang of it, you’ll see that it saves a lot of time and improves your
accuracy as well.
Now here’s the best part: You can use the slide to save time with punctuation
and numerals, too. The next time you need to type a punctuation mark or
number, try this technique:
1. Start a slide action with your finger on the .?123 key (the key to the
left of the Space key when the alphabetical keyboard is active).
This is a slide, not a tap, so don’t lift your finger just yet.
2. When the punctuation and numeric keyboard appears on the screen,
slide your finger onto the punctuation mark or number you want to
type.
3. Lift your finger.
The cool thing is that the punctuation and numeric keyboard disappears and
the alphabetical keyboard reappears all without tapping the .?123 key to dis-
play the punctuation and numeric keyboard, and without tapping the ABC
key (the key to the left of the Space key when the punctuation and numeric
keyboard is active).
Practice these two techniques and we guarantee that in a few days you’ll be
typing faster and more accurately.
Don’t Bother with Don’t
While on the subject of punctuation, you can type dont to get to don’t, and
cant to get to can’t. We’ve told you to put some faith in the iPhone’s auto-
correction software. And that applies to contractions. In other words, let 
the iPhone’s intelligent keyboard insert the apostrophes on your behalf for
these and other common words and save time.

We’re aware of at least one exception. The iPhone cannot distinguish
between it’s the contraction of “it is” and its the possessive adjective and pos-
sessive pronoun.
Here you thought you were buying a tech book and you get a grammar lesson
thrown in at no extra charge. Just think of us as full service authors.
Three Ways to View the iPhone’s Capacity
When your iPhone is selected in the source list in iTunes, you see a colorful
chart at the bottom of the screen that tells you how your iPhone’s capacity is
being used by your media and other data.
By default, the chart shows the amount of space your audio, video, and
photo files use on your iPhone in GB or MB. But you knew that. What you
probably don’t know is that when you click the colorful chart, it cycles
through two slightly different displays. The first click changes the display
from space used to the number of items. The second click changes the dis-
play to the total playing time (Audio and Video only), as shown in Figure 17-1.
This is particularly helpful before you go on a trip. Knowing that you have 5.5
hours of video and 1.8 days of audio is far more useful than knowing how
many gigabytes you’re packing.
Figure 17-1: Click the colorful chart, and what’s stored on 
your iPhone is expressed in different ways.

So You Want to Sync Notes, Do You?
As you’ve no doubt discovered by now, there’s no easy way to synchronize
notes between iPhone’s Notes application and your computer.
If you’d like to sync a note or notes, though, we know of a kludge. Rather than
using the Notes application, you use your contact manager program and the
Contacts list in the Phone application. Each contact has its own notes field
and each notes field can contain a pretty good amount of text.
Assault on batteries
Because this is a chapter of tips and hints, and
we consider it important to help you not run out
of juice before you’re ready, we’d be remiss if
we didn’t include some ways you can extend
your battery life (even if it does cause this “Part
of Tens” chapter to contain more than ten
items).
First and foremost: If you use a carrying case for
your iPhone, charging the phone while it’s in that
case may generate more heat than is healthy for
your phone. Overheating is bad for both battery
capacity and battery life, so if your iPhone gets
a little toasty when you charge it in its case, take
it out of the case before you charge it.
Bluetooth consumes power even when it’s not
being used. If you’re not using a Bluetooth
device (such as a headset or car kit), make sure
Bluetooth is turned off. To do so, tap Settings on
the Home screen, tap General, tap Bluetooth,
and then tap the On/Off switch if necessary to
turn off Bluetooth.
Just as Bluetooth consumes power even when
you’re not using it, so does Wi-Fi, so turn it off
when you’re not using it. Tap Settings on the
Home screen, then tap General, Network, Wi-Fi,
and then tap the On/Off switch if necessary to
turn off Wi-Fi.
Activating Auto-Brightness allows the screen
brightness to adjust based on current lighting
conditions. This can be easier on your battery
than cranking it up and leaving it set to a bright
setting. To activate this feature, tap Settings on
the Home screen, tap Brightness, and then tap
its On/Off switch if necessary to turn it on.
Finally, turning on EQ (equalizer; see Chapter 7
for details) when you listen to music can make it
sound better, but it also uses more processing
power. Turning off EQ will help your battery last
longer. If you’ve added EQ to tracks in iTunes via
the Track Info window and you want to retain
the EQ from iTunes, set the EQ on your iPhone to
flat. Since you’re not turning off EQ, your battery
life will be slightly worse. But your songs will
sound just the way you expect them to sound.
Either way, to alter your EQ settings, tap Settings
on the Home screen, tap iPod, and then tap EQ.
According to Apple, a properly maintained
iPhone battery will retain up to 80% of its origi-
nal capacity after 400 full charge and discharge
cycles. But you can replace the battery at any
time if it no longer holds sufficient charge to
meet your needs.
Your one-year limited warranty includes the
replacement of a defective battery. If you
choose to extend your coverage to two years
with the AppleCare Protection Plan for the
iPhone, Apple will replace the battery if it drops
below 50% of its original capacity.
If your iPhone is out of warranty, Apple will
replace the battery for $79.00, plus $6.95 ship-
ping, plus local tax, and then dispose of your old
battery in an environmentally friendly manner.

So the kludge is to create fake contacts and use their notes fields for notes
you want to sync. Then, after you sync, and assuming you remember the
name(s) of your fake contact(s), the notes will appear on both your phone
and your computer.
It may not be the most elegant solution, but it does work.
Tricks with Links and Phone Numbers
The iPhone does something special when it encounters phone numbers or URLs
in e-mail and SMS text messages. For example, the iPhone interprets as a phone
number any sequence of numbers that looks like a phone number — #-###-###-
####, ###-####, #.###.###.#### and so on. The same goes for sequences of
characters that look like a Web address (URL), such as http://www.WebSite
Name.com or www.WebSiteName.com. When that happens they appear as blue
links on your screen. Tap them and the iPhone does the right thing. It launches
the Phone application and dials the number for phone numbers, or launches
Safari and takes you to the appropriate Web page for URLs.
That’s useful but somewhat expected. What’s more useful and not so expected
is the way Safari handles phone numbers and URLs.
Let’s start with phone numbers. When you encounter a phone number on a
Web page, give it a tap. A little dialog box appears on the screen displaying
that phone number and offering you a choice of two buttons: Call or Cancel.
Tap Call to switch to the Phone application and dial the number; tap Cancel
to return to the Web page.
Here’s another cool Safari trick, this time with links. If you press and hold on
a link rather than tapping it, a little floating text bubble appears and shows
you the underlying URL.
The same thing happens if you press and hold on a URL in Mail or Text,
which we find even more useful because it enables you to spot bogus links
without switching to Safari or actually visiting the URL.
Share the Love
Ever stumble upon a Web page you just have to share with a buddy? The
iPhone makes its dead simple. From the site in question, tap the address field
at the top of the browser. Then tap the Share button that appears in the
upper-left corner of the screen. Upon doing so, the Mail program opens. The
subject line is already pre-populated with the name of the Web site you’re vis-
iting. And the URL appears in the area in which you can compose a message.
Type whatever you want to say and supply your pal’s e-mail address. Send it
along like any e-mail.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Make Web Browsing with EDGE 
Up to Five Times Faster!
When we saw this tip on the Web (at www.iPhonePOV.com), we tried it imme-
diately and were thrilled to discover that it really does make Web surfing
over AT&T’s EDGE data network much faster.
While having the “real” Internet on your iPhone is a blessing, the preponder-
ance of pages with complex JavaScripts and annoying blinking ads can make
using EDGE to access those pages a curse. Unfortunately, EDGE just doesn’t
have the bandwidth for such frippery.
So here’s the workaround: The trick is to access the Web via a proxy server
that strips all the stuff you don’t need, such as blinking ads, pop-ups, and
other flashy but useless components, leaving only the good content for you
to enjoy. More or less.
Fortunately, one of iPhonePOV’s graphic designers has a cousin who knows
someone who works at Google, and they convinced her to have Google set up
a proxy server for the iPhone and keep it a secret from every Web site except
iPhonePOV.com.
We’d like to pause here for a moment to thank both iPhonePOV and Google.
You ROCK!
To surf the Web up to five times faster, follow these instructions to access the
Google Mobile proxy server on your iPhone:
1. Tap the Safari icon on your Home screen.
2. Enter the URL: http://www.google.com/m.
The m stands for mobile.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap Mobile under the words
“View Google in.” 
If you can’t tap Mobile because it’s not a link, you’re already viewing
Google in its Mobile mode. 
4. Tap the link for Settings a couple of lines above “View Google in.”
5. Find the Format Pages for Your Mobile Phone setting and tap the
button to turn it on.
6. Scroll down and tap the Save button at the bottom of the page.
The Google Mobile page reappears and from this point forward, anything you
search for or link to from Google Mobile is formatted for faster loading by

Google’s Mobile proxy server. Use the Search box on the Google Mobile page
and every site on the Web is diddled to appear quickly on your iPhone.
If you visit a page through the proxy server and know you want to revisit it
someday, bookmark it. Tap that bookmark and the faster-loading Google
Mobile version of the page loads.
The only downside is that every so often you actually want to see the frip-
pery that the Google Mobile proxy server strips off a page. No problem. Just
scroll to the bottom of the Google Mobile page, look for “View Google in,” and
tap the link to Classic. The “real” version of Google loads and you can search
for and visit pages the old, slower way.
If you are interested in the back-story on why this works (which has to do with
older mobile phones and something called WAP), we suggest you read the orig-
inal tip at: http://www.iphonepov.com/2007/06/iphone-browsing-with-
edge-5x-faster.html.
Once again, thanks to iPhonePOV and Google for taking some of the sting out
of using EDGE.
Choosing a Home Page for Safari
You may have noticed that there’s no home page Web site on the iPhone ver-
sion of Safari as there is in the Mac and PC version of the browser (and for
that matter every other Web browser we know of). Instead, when you tap the
Safari icon, you return to the last site you visited.
The folks at Macworld have a suggested workaround. Just create a bookmark
for your favorite site and drag it to the top of the bookmarks list (following
the instructions in Chapter 10). It’s not a perfect remedy, but it will get you
home that much faster.
Storing Files
A tiny Massachusetts software company known as Ecamm Network is selling
an inexpensive piece of Mac OS X software that lets you copy files from your
computer to your iPhone and copy files from the iPhone to a computer.
(There is no Windows version.) Better still, you can try the $9.95 program
called iPhoneDrive for a week before deciding whether you want to buy it. 
Go to www.ecamm.com to fetch the free demo.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In a nutshell, here’s how it works. After downloading the software onto your
Mac, double-click the program’s icon to start it. You’ll see the window dis-
played in Figure 17-2.
Figure 17-2: The iPhoneDrive file browser and toolbar.
To transfer files and folders to the iPhone (assuming there’s room on the
device), click the Copy to iPhone button on the toolbar and click to select the
files you want to copy. The files are copied into the appropriate folder on the
iPhone. Alternatively, drag files and folders from the Mac desktop or a Finder
window into the iPhoneDrive browser.
To go the other way and copy files from your iPhone to your computer, high-
light the files or folders you want copied, and click the Copy from iPhone
button on the toolbar. Select the destination on your Mac where you want to
store the files and then click Save.
You can also drag files or folders from the iPhoneDrive browser into a Finder
window or the desktop. Or double-click a file to download it to the Mac’s
Documents folder.
But there are limitations. iPhoneDrive doesn’t provide access to music
synced in iTunes or photos taken with iPhone’s camera. What’s more,
iPhoneDrive is for storage only, so you can’t access any data on the iPhone’s
screen.

Stupid Dock Tricks
Ostensibly the purpose of the iPhone dock is to synch the device with your
computer and, oh yeah, charge the device while doing so (provided your
computer hasn’t fallen asleep or isn’t in standby mode).
But while the iPhone lets you listen to music through its internal speakers,
you may want to take advantage of the dock’s line out connector on the back
to hook up superior powered speakers.
By the way, we ran across one posting at www.iphonetipoftheday.com sug-
gesting that plugging the iPhone into its cradle acts as a mini-subwoofer to
amplify music played back through the iPhone ‘s own speakers. Frankly, we
had a hard time hearing any difference.
Apple itself maintains that speakerphone calls sound better when the iPhone
is docked because of something called audio porting.
Separate from all that, we discovered one other unintended if imperfect bene-
fit of a docked iPhone; you can snap a picture without the camera shaking.
