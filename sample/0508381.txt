ABSTRACT

Sphere packings in high dimensions interest mathematicians and physicists and have

direct applications in communications theory. Remarkably, no one has been able to provide

exponential improvement on a 100-year-old lower bound on the maximal packing density due
to Minkowski in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd. The asymptotic behavior of this bound
is controlled by 2−d in high dimensions. Using an optimization procedure that we introduced
earlier [TS02] and a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings in Rd,
we obtain a conjectural lower bound on the density whose asymptotic behavior is controlled
by 2−0.77865...d, thus providing the putative exponential improvement of Minkowski’s bound.
The conjecture states that a hard-core nonnegative tempered distribution is a pair correlation
function of a translationally invariant disordered sphere packing in Rd for asymptotically
large d if and only if the Fourier transform of the autocovariance function is nonnegative.

The conjecture is supported by two explicit analytically characterized disordered packings,

numerical packing constructions in low dimensions, known necessary conditions that only have

relevance in very low dimensions, and the fact that we can recover the forms of known rigorous

lower bounds. A byproduct of our approach is an asymptotic conjectural lower bound on the
average kissing number whose behavior is controlled by 20.22134...d, which is to be compared
to the best known asymptotic lower bound on the individual kissing number of 20.2075...d.

Interestingly, our optimization procedure is precisely the dual of a primal linear program

devised by Cohn and Elkies [CE03] to obtain upper bounds on the density, and hence has

implications for linear programming bounds. This connection proves that our density estimate

can never exceed the Cohn-Elkies upper bound, regardless of the validity of our conjecture.

Introduction

A collection of congruent spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd is called a sphere
packing P if no two of the spheres have an interior point in common. The packing density or
simply density φ(P ) of a sphere packing is the fraction of space Rd covered by the spheres.
We will call

φ(P )

φmax = sup
P ⊂Rd
the maximal density, where the supremum is taken over all packings in Rd. The sphere
packing problem seeks to answer the following question: Among all packings of congruent
spheres, what is the maximal packing density φmax, i.e., largest fraction of Rd covered by the
spheres, and what are the corresponding arrangements of the spheres [Rog64, CS98]? The

(1)

sphere packing problem is of great fundamental and practical interest, and arises in a variety

of contexts, including classical ground states of matter in low dimensions [CL95], the famous

Kepler conjecture for d = 3 [Hal98], error-correcting codes [CS98] and spherical codes [CS98].

For arbitrary d, the sphere packing problem is notoriously diﬃcult to solve. In the case

of packings of congruent d-dimensional spheres, the exact solution is known for the ﬁrst three

space dimensions. For d = 1, the answer is trivial because the spheres tile the space so

that φmax = 1. In two dimensions, the optimal solution is the triangular lattice arrangement
(also called the hexagonal packing) with φmax = π/√12.
In three dimensions, the Kepler
conjecture that the face-centered cubic lattice arrangement provides the densest packing with
φmax = π/√18 was only recently proved by Hales [Hal98]. For 3 < d < 10, the densest known
packings of congruent spheres are lattice packings (deﬁned below). However, for suﬃciently

large d, lattice packings are likely not to be the densest.

Indeed, this paper suggests that

disordered sphere arrangements may be the densest packings as d

.

→ ∞

We review some basic deﬁnitions that we will subsequently employ. A packing is saturated

if there is no space available to add another sphere without overlapping the existing particles.
The set of lattice packings is a subset of the set of sphere packings in Rd. A lattice Λ in Rd is
a subgroup consisting of the integer linear combinations of vectors that constitute a basis for
Rd. A lattice packing PL is one in which the centers of nonoverlapping spheres are located at
the points of Λ. In a lattice packing, the space Rd can be geometrically divided into identical
regions F called fundamental cells, each of which contains the center of just one sphere. Thus,
the density of a lattice packing φL consisting of spheres of unit diameter is given by

φL =

v1(1/2)
Vol(F )

,

2

(2)

where

v1(R) =

πd/2
Γ(1 + d/2)

Rd

(3)

is the volume of a d-dimensional sphere of radius R and Vol(F ) is the volume of a fundamental

cell. We will call

φL
max = sup
PL⊂Rd
the maximal density among all lattice packings in Rd. For a general packing of spheres of
unit diameter for which a density φ(P ) exists, it is useful to introduce the number (or center)

φ(PL)

(4)

density ρ deﬁned by

ρ =

φ(P )
v1(1/2)

,

(5)

which therefore can be interpreted as the average number of sphere centers per unit volume.

Three distinct categories of packings have been distinguished, depending on their be-

havior with respect to nonoverlapping geometric constraints and/or externally imposed vir-

tual displacements: locally jammed, collectively jammed, and strictly jammed [TS01, TDS03,

DTSC04]. Loosely speaking, these jamming categories, listed in order of increasing stringency,

reﬂect the degree of mechanical stability of the packing. A packing is locally jammed if each

particle in the system is locally trapped by its neighbors; i.e., it cannot be translated while

ﬁxing the positions of all other particles. Each sphere simply has to have at least d + 1 con-

tacts with neighboring spheres, not all in the same d-dimensional hemisphere. A collectively

jammed packing is any locally jammed conﬁguration in which no ﬁnite subset of particles can

simultaneously be continuously displaced so that its members move out of contact with one

another and with the remainder set. A strictly jammed packing is any collectively jammed

conﬁguration that disallows all globally uniform volume-nonincreasing deformations of the

system boundary. Importantly, the jamming category is generally dependent on the type of

boundary conditions imposed (e.g., hard wall or periodic boundary conditions) as well as the

shape of the boundary. The range of possible densities for a given jamming category decreases

with increasing stringency of the category. Whereas the lowest-density states of collectively

and strictly jammed packings in two or three dimensions are currently unknown, one can

achieve locally jammed packings with vanishing density [B¨or64]. This classiﬁcation of pack-

ings according to jamming criteria is closely related to the concepts of “rigid” and “stable”

packings found in the mathematics literature [CBB98].

In the next section, we summarize some previous upper and lower bounds on the maxi-

mal density. For large d, the asymptotic behavior of the well-known Minkowski lower bound
[Min05] on the maximal density is controlled by 2−d. Thus far, no one has been able to provide

3

exponential improvement on this lower bound. Using an optimization procedure and a con-

jecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings in high dimensions, we obtain

conjectural lower bounds that yield the long-sought asymptotic exponential improvement on

Minkowski’s bound. We believe that consideration of truly disordered packings is the key

notion that will yield exponential improvement on Minkowski’s lower bound. A byproduct of

our approach is an asymptotic conjectural lower bound on the average kissing number that is

superior to the best known asymptotic lower bound on the individual kissing number.

2 Some Previous Upper and Lower Bounds

The nonconstructive lower bounds of Minkowski [Min05] established the existence of reason-
ably dense lattice packings. He found that the maximal density φL

extensions and generalizations of (6) have been obtained [DR47, Bal92, CS98], but none of
these investigations have been able to improve upon the dominant exponential term 2−d. It
is useful to note that the density of a saturated packing of congruent spheres in Rd for all d
satisﬁes

φ

2d .

(7)

≥
The proof is trivial. A saturated packing of congruent spheres of unit diameter and density φ
in Rd has the property that each point in space lies within a unit distance from the center of
some sphere. Thus, a covering of the space is achieved if each sphere center is encompassed
by a sphere of unit radius and the density of this covering is 2dφ

1. Thus, the bound (7),

which is sometimes called the “greedy” lower bound, has same the dominant exponential term

≥

as (6). In Section 4.1, we show that there exists a construction of a disordered packing of
congruent spheres that realizes the weaker lower bound of (7), i.e., φ = 2−d.

The best currently known lower bound on φL

max was obtained by Ball [Bal92]. He found

Nontrivial upper bounds on the maximal density φmax for any sphere packing in Rd
have been derived. Blichfeldt [Bli29] showed that the maximal packing density for all d

satisﬁes φmax ≤
by an analysis of the Voronoi cells. For large d, Rogers’ upper bound asymptotically becomes

limit d

yields φmax ≤

linear programming upper bounds, which provided improvement over Rogers’ upper bound for

dimensions 4 through 36. They also conjectured that their approach could be used to prove

sphere packing in

to prove that the Leech lattice is the unique densest lattice in

sharp bounds in 8 and 24 dimensions. Indeed, Cohn and Kumar [CK04] used these techniques
24. They also proved that no
24 can exceed the density of the Leech lattice by a factor of more than
8. Table 2

3 Realizability of Point Processes

As will be described in Section 5, our new approach to lower bounds on the density of sphere
packings in Rd rests on whether certain one- and two-point correlation functions are realizable
by sphere packings. As we will discuss, a sphere packing can be regarded to be a special

case of a point process and so a more general question concerns the necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for the realizability of point processes in Rd. Before discussing the realizability of

5

point processes, it is useful to recall some basic results from the theory of spatial stochastic
(x1, x2, . . . xd) denote a vector position in Rd. Consider a
(or random) processes. Let x

3.1 Ordinary Stochastic Processes

We will assume that the stochastic process is translationally invariant (i.e., statistically ho-

mogeneous in space). Let us further assume that the mean µ =

exist, where angular brackets denote an expectation, i.e., an average over all realizations. The
fact that the mean µ and autocovariance function χ(r) are independent of the variable x is a

consequence of the translational invariance of the measure. Clearly,

χ(r) is continuous at the point r = 0, the process Y (x) on Rd will be mean square continuous,

r = 0, it is continuous for all r.

Does every continuous positive semideﬁnite function f (r) correspond to a translationally
invariant ordinary stochastic process with a continuous autocovariance χ(r)? The answer is

6

yes, and a proof is given in the book by Lo`eve [Lo`e63] for stochastic processes in time. Here

we state without proof the generalization to stochastic processes in space.

Theorem 3.1 A continuous function f (r) on Rd is an autocovariance function of a transla-
tionally invariant ordinary stochastic process if and only if it is positive semideﬁnite.

Remark:

Assuming that f (r) is positive semideﬁnite, one needs to show that there exists a random
variable Y (x) on Rd such that
that there exists a Gaussian (normal) process for every autocovariance function [Lo`e63]. A

crucial property of a Gaussian process is that its full probability distribution is completely

determined by its mean and autocovariance.

The nonnegativity condition (12) is diﬃcult to check. It turns out that it is easier to es-

tablish the existence of an autocovariance function by appealing to its spectral representation.

3.2 Generalized Stochastic Processes

The types of autocovariance functions that we are interested in must allow for generalized

functions, such as Dirac delta functions. The Weiner-Khintchine theorem has been extended

to autocovariances in the class of generalized functions called tempered distributions, i.e.,

continuous linear functionals on the space S of inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions Φ(x) such
that Φ(x) as well as all of its derivatives decay faster than polynomially. Nonnegative tempered
distributions are nonnegative unbounded measures ν on Rd such that

unit diameter is simply a point process in which any pair of points cannot be closer than a

unit distance from one another.

It is known that the probability measure on (X,

of n-point correlation functions ρn, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . meet certain conditions [Len73, Len75a,
Len75b]. The n-point correlation function ρn(r1, r2, . . . , rn) is the contribution to the ex-

Note that for a translationally invariant Poisson point process, gn is unity for all values of its

As we indicated in the beginning of this section, the ﬁrst two correlation functions,
ρ1(r1) = ρ and ρ2(r1, r2) = ρ2g2(r), for translationally invariant point processes are of central
concern in this paper. If the point process is also rotationally invariant (statistically isotropic),

then g2 depends on the radial distance r =

and is referred to as the radial distribution function. Strictly speaking, one should use diﬀerent

notation for the left and right members of Eq. (22), but to conform to conventional statistical-
mechanical usage, we invoke the common notation for both. Because ρ2(r1, r2)/ρ = ρg2(r) is
a conditional joint probability density, then

Note that the radial distribution function g2(r) (or any of the ρn) for a point process must be
able to incorporate Dirac delta functions. We will speciﬁcally consider those radial distribution

10

functions that are nonnegative distributions. For example, g2(r) for a lattice packing is the
rotational symmetrization of the sum of delta functions at lattice points at a radial distance

r from any lattice point [TS03].

For a translationally invariant point process, the autocovariance function χ(r) is related

to the pair correlation function via

χ(r) = ρδ(r) + ρ2h(r),

is the total correlation function. This relation is obtained using deﬁnitions (9) and (16) with
Y (x) = n(x). Note that χ(r) = ρδ(r) (i.e., h = 0) for a translationally invariant Poisson point

process. Positive and negative pair correlations are deﬁned as those instances in which h is

positive (i.e., g2 > 1) and h is negative (i.e., g2 < 1), respectively. The Fourier transform of
the distribution-valued function χ(r) is given by

˜χ(k) = ρ + ρ2˜h(k),

(28)

where ˜h(k) is the Fourier transform of h(r). It is common practice in statistical physics to
deal with a function trivially related to the spectral function ˜χ(k) called the structure factor

S(k), i.e.,

S(k)

(29)

A natural question to ask at this point is the following: Given a positive number density ρ
and a pair correlation function g2(r), does there exist a translationally invariant point process
in Rd with measure
for which ρ and g2 are one-point and two-point correlation functions,
respectively. Two obvious nonnegativity conditions [TS02] that must be satisﬁed are the

(28) and (29). However, for realizability of point processes in arbitrary dimension d, the

two standard conditions (30) and (31) are only necessary, not necessary and suﬃcient. The

11

same state of aﬀairs applies to the theory of random sets [Tor02], where it is known that the

Wiener-Khintchine theorem only provides a necessary condition on realizable autocovariance
functions. The simplest example of a random set is one in which Rd is partitioned into two
disjoint regions (phases) but with an interface that is only known in a probabilistic sense. (A

packing can therefore be viewed as a special random set). Thus, a random set is described

by a random variable that is the indicator function for a particular phase, i.e., it is a binary

stochastic process. The class of autocovariances that comes from a binary stochastic process

is a subclass of the total class that comes from an ordinary process

meets the existence condition of Theorem 3.2. Similarly, the class of autocovariances that

comes from a point process is a subset of of a generalized process

therefore the existence condition of Theorem 3.2 is only necessary.

It has recently come to light that a positive g2 for a positive ρ must satisfy an uncount-
able number of necessary and suﬃcient conditions for it to correspond to a realizable point

process [CL04]. However, these conditions are very diﬃcult (or, more likely, impossible) to
check for arbitrary dimension. In other words, given ρ1 = ρ and ρ2 = ρ2g2, it is diﬃcult to
ascertain if there are some higher-order functions ρ3, ρ4, . . . for which these one- and two-point
correlation functions hold. Thus, an important practical problem becomes the determination

of a manageable number of necessary conditions that can be readily checked.

One such additional necessary condition, obtained by Yamada [Yam61], is concerned with

This inequality is a consequence of the fact that the number of points N(A) within a window

at some ﬁxed position is an integer, not a continuous variable, and sets a lower limit on the

number variance. We note in passing that the determination of the number variance for lattice

point patterns is an outstanding problem in number theory [Ken48, KR53, SS05]. The number

variance for a speciﬁc choice of A is necessarily a positive number and generally related to the
total pair correlation function h(r) for a translationally invariant point process [TS03]. In the
special case of a spherical window of radius R in Rd, it is explicitly given by

12

R whose centers are separated by a distance r divided by v1(R). We will call α2(r; R) the
scaled intersection volume. The lower bound (33) provides another integral condition on the

pair correlation function.

For large R, it has been proved that σ2(R) cannot grow more slowly than γRd−1, where

γ is a positive constant [Bec87]. This implies that the Yamada lower bound in (33) is always

satisﬁed for for suﬃciently large R for any d
2. In fact, we have not been able to construct

any examples of a pair correlation function g2(r) at some number density ρ that satisfy the
two nonnegativity conditions (30) and (31) and simultaneously violate the Yamada condition

for any R and any d
2. Thus, it appears that the Yamada condition is most relevant
in one dimension, especially in those cases when σ2(R) is bounded. We note that point
Rd−1 for large R are examples
processes (translationally invariant or not) for which σ2(R)

(34)

The scaled intersection volume α2(r; R) appearing in (33) will play a prominent role in
this paper. It has support in the interval [0, 2R), the range [0, 1] and the following integral

representation:

Before closing this section, it is useful to note that there has been some recent work that

demonstrates the existence of point processes for a speciﬁc ρ and g2 provided that ρ and g2
meet certain restrictions. For example, Ambartzumian and Sukiasian proved the existence

of point processes that come from Gibbs measures for a special g2 for suﬃciently small ρ
[AS91]. Determinantal point processes have been considered by Soshnikov [Sos00] and Costin

and Lebowitz [CL04]. Costin and Lebowitz have also studied certain one-dimensional renewal

point processes [CL04]. Stillinger and Torquato [ST04] discussed the possible existence of

a general interparticle pair potential (associated with a Gibbs measure) for a given ρ and

g2 using a cluster expansion procedure but did not address the issue of convergence of this
expansion. Koralov [Kor05] indeed proves the existence of a pair potential on a lattice (with

the restriction of single occupancy per lattice site) for which ρ is the density and g2 is the
pair correlation function for suﬃciently small ρ and g2. There is no reason to believe that
Koralov’s proof is not directly extendable to the case of a point process corresponding to
a sphere packing in Rd, where the nonoverlap condition is the analog of single occupancy
on the lattice. Thus, we expect that one can prove the existence of a pair potential in Rd

14

corresponding to a sphere packing for a given ρ and g2 provided that ρ and g2 suﬃciently
small.

4 Disordered Packings in High Dimensions and the Decor-

relation Principle

In this section, we examine the asymptotic behavior of certain disordered packings in high

dimensions and show that unconstrained spatial correlations vanish asymptotically, yielding
a decorrelation principle. We deﬁne a disordered packing in Rd to be one in which the pair
−d−ε for some
correlation function g2(r) decays to its long-range value of unity faster than
ε > 0. The decorrelation principle as well as a number of other results (that will be discussed

r

|

|

in Section 5) motivate us to propose a conjecture in Section 5 that describes the circumstances

in which the two standard nonnegativity conditions (30) and (31) are necessary and suﬃcient

to ensure the existence of a disordered sphere packing.

4.1 Example 1: Disordered Sequential Packings

First we show that there exists a disordered sphere packing that realizes the greedy lower
bound (7) (φ = 1/2d) for all d. Then we study the asymptotic properties of the n-particle

correlation functions in the large dimension limit.

The disordered packing that achieves the greedy lower bound is a special case of a general-

ization of the so-called random sequential addition (RSA) process [Tor02]. This generalization,

which we introduce here, is a subset of the Poisson point process. Speciﬁcally, the centers of
“test” spheres of unit diameter arrive continually throughout Rd during time t
to a translationally invariant Poisson process of density per unit time η, i.e., η is the number

0 according

≥

of points per unit volume and time. Therefore, the expected number of centers in a region

of volume Ω during time t is ηΩt and the probability that this region is empty of centers is

exp(

ηΩt). However, this Poisson distribution of test spheres is not a packing because the

spheres can overlap. To create a packing from this point process, one must remove test spheres

−

such that no sphere center can lie within a spherical region of unit radius from any sphere

center. Without loss of generality, we will set η = 1.

There is a variety of ways of achieving this “thinning” process such that the subset of

points correspond to a sphere packing. One obvious rule is to retain a test sphere at time t only

15

if it does not overlap a sphere that was successfully added to the packing at an earlier time.
This criterion deﬁnes the well-known RSA process in Rd [Tor02], and is clearly a statistically
homogeneous and isotropic sphere packing in Rd with a time-dependent density φ(t). In the
limit t
, the RSA process corresponds to a saturated packing with a maximal or saturation

density φs(

it have been obtained via computer experiments for low dimensions [Tor02]. However, as we

will discuss below, the standard RSA process at small times (or, equivalently, small densities)

can be analyzed exactly.

Another thinning criterion retains a test sphere centered at position r at time t if no other
test sphere is within a unit radial distance from r for the time interval κt prior to t, where κ

is a positive constant in the interval [0, 1]. This packing is a subset of the RSA packing, and

therefore we refer to it as the generalized RSA process. Note that when κ = 0, the standard

RSA process is recovered, and when κ = 1, a relatively unknown model due to Mat´ern [Mat86]

is recovered. The latter is amenable to exact analysis.

The time-dependent density φ(t) in the case of the generalized RSA process with κ = 1

is easily obtained. (Note that for any 0 < κ

1, the generalized RSA process is always an

≤
unsaturated packing.) In this packing, a test sphere at time t is accepted only if does not

overlap an existing sphere in the packing as well as any previously rejected test sphere (which

we will call “ghost” spheres.) An overlap cannot occur if a test sphere is outside a unit radius

of any successfully added sphere or ghost sphere. Because of the underlying Poisson process,

the probability that a trial sphere is retained at time t is given by exp(

v1(1)t), where v1(1) is
the volume of a sphere of unit radius having the same center as the retained sphere of radius

−

1/2. Therefore, the expected number density ρ(t) and packing density φ(t) at any time t are

respectively given by

and details are given elsewhere [TS06].

It is useful to note that at small times or, equivalently, low densities, formula (40) yields
(t3), which when inverted yields

attribute and subsequently formulate what we refer to as a “decorrelation principle.”

4.2 Example 2: The Classic Gibbsian Hard-Sphere Packing

The statistical mechanics of the classic Gibbsian hard-sphere packing is well established (see

[Tor02] and references therein). The purpose of this subsection is simply to collect some results
that motivate the decorrelation principle. Let ΦN (rN ) be the N-body interaction potential
for a ﬁnite but large number of particles with conﬁguration rN
in a volume
V in Rd at absolute temperature T . A large collection of such systems in which N, V and
T are ﬁxed but in which the particle conﬁgurations are otherwise free to vary is called the

r1, r2, . . . , rN }

≡ {

Gibbs canonical ensemble. Our interest is in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., the distinguished

limit in which N

and V

such that the number density ρ = N/V exists. For a

→ ∞

→ ∞

Gibbs canonical ensemble, when the n-particle densities ρn (deﬁned in Section 3) exist, they
are entirely determined by the interaction potential ΦN (rN ). For a hard-sphere packing, the
interaction potential is given by a sum of pairwise terms such that

ΦN (rN ) =

Thus, the particles do not interact for interparticle separation distances greater than or equal

to unity but experience an inﬁnite repulsive force for distances less than unity. The hard

spheres have kinetic energy, and therefore a temperature, but the temperature enters in a

trivial way because the conﬁgurational correlations between the spheres are independent of the

temperature. We call this the classic equilibrium sphere packing, which is both translationally

and rotationally invariant.

In one dimension, the n-particle densities ρn for such packings are known exactly in
the thermodynamic limit. The density φ lies in the interval [0, 1] but this one-dimensional

Figure 3: The radial distribution function for the classic three-dimensional equilibrium packing

at φ = 0.49 as obtained from molecular dynamics computer simulations. The graph is adapted

from Figure 3.15 of Torquato [Tor02].

packing is devoid of a discontinuous (ﬁrst-order) transition from a disordered (liquid) phase to

an ordered (solid) phase. Although a rigorous proof for the existence of a liquid-to-solid phase

transition in two or three dimensions is not yet available, there is overwhelming numerical

evidence (as obtained from computer simulations) that such a transformation takes place at

suﬃciently high densities. The maximal densities for equilibrium sphere packings in two and
three dimensions are φmax = π/√12 and φmax = π/√18, respectively, i.e., they correspond to
the density of the densest sphere packing in the respective dimension.

Figure 3 shows the three-dimensional radial distribution function as obtained from com-

puter simulations for a density φ = 0.49, which is near the maximum value for the stable

disordered branch. It is seen that the packing exhibits short-range order [i.e., g2(r) has both
positive and negative correlations for small r], but g2(r) decays to its long-range value expo-
nentially fast after several diameters. By contrast, in the limit d
, it has been shown that

the “pressure” [Rue99] of an equilibrium packing is exactly given by the ﬁrst two terms of its

asymptotic low-density expansion for some positive density interval [0, φ0] [WRF87, FP99].
(Roughly speaking, the pressure is the average force per unit area acting on an “imaginary

planar wall” in the packing due collisions between the spheres and the wall.) Frisch and Percus
[FP99] have established, albeit not rigorously, that φ0 = 1/2d. This result for the pressure
implies that the leading-order term of the low-density expansion of the radial distribution

Again, as in the generalized RSA example with κ = 1, gn factorizes into products involving

the same low-density expansions of the gn through terms of order φ and therefore the same
asymptotic expressions (59) and (60).

4.3 Decorrelation Principle

The previous two examples illustrate two important and related asymptotic properties that

are expected to apply to all disordered packings:

1. the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of g2 is the same as the asymptotic behavior
in the low-density limit for any ﬁnite d, i.e., unconstrained spatial correlations, which

exist for positive densities at ﬁxed d, vanish asymptotically for pair distances beyond

the hard-core diameter in the high-dimensional limit;

2. and gn for n

3 asymptotically can be inferred from a knowledge of only the pair

correlation function g2 and number density ρ.

≥

What is the explanation for these two related asymptotic properties? Because we know from

the Kabatiansky and Levenshtein (1979) asymptotic upper bound on the maximal density that
φ must go to zero at least as fast as 2−0.5990d for large d, unconstrained spatial correlations

between spheres must vanish, i.e., statistical independence is established.

(An example of

constrained spatial correlations is described below.) Such a decorrelation means that the gn
for n
3 are determined entirely from a knowledge of the decorrelated pair correlation function

g2. In the speciﬁc examples that we considered, the gn factorize into products involving only
g2’s, but there may be other decompositions. For example, the gn for n
3 can be functionals
that only involve ρ and g2. We will call the two asymptotic properties the decorrelation
principle for disordered packings. This principle as well as other results described in Section

≥

5 leads us to a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings in high

dimensions, which we state in Section 5.1.

An example of constrained spatial correlations that would not vanish asymptotically is

illustrated in Fig. 4, where we show the pair correlation function g2(r) for a three-dimensional
sphere packing near the so-called maximally random jammed state [TTD00, Tor02]. A special

feature of g2(r) for a maximally random jammed packing is a delta-function contribution
at r = 1, which reﬂects the fact that the average kissing number (i.e., average number of

contacting particles per particle) is eﬀectively six for this collectively jammed packing, meaning

that the packing is isostatic [DST05]. A positive average kissing number is required if the
packing is constrained to be jammed and in Rd this means that the average kissing number
is 2d for either collective or strict jamming [DST05]. Isostatic packings are jammed packings

with the minimum number of contacts for a particular jamming category. According to the

Decorrelation Principle, as d tends to inﬁnity, g2 for a maximally random jammed packing

explicitly shown) corresponds to an average kissing number of about six.

asymptotic limit of a step function Θ(r

crucial. We note that maximally random jammed packings contain about 2–3% rattler spheres,

i.e., spheres trapped in a cage of jammed neighbors but free to move within the cage.

5 New Approach to Lower Bounds

The salient ideas behind our new approach to the derivation of lower bounds on φmax were
actually laid out in our earlier work [TS02]. The main objective of that work was to study

sphere packings in three dimensions in which long-range order was suppressed and short-
3) using so-called g2-invariant
range order was controlled (i.e., disordered sphere packings in
processes. A g2-invariant process is one in which a given nonnegative pair correlation g2(r)
function remains invariant for all r over the range of densities

The terminal density φ∗ is the maximum achievable density for the g2-invariant process subject

g2’s had been considered, which incorporated the known features of core exclusion, contact
pairs, and damped oscillatory short-range order beyond contact. The problem of ﬁnding the

maximal packing fraction φ∗ was posed as an optimization problem: maximize φ over the set

of parameters subject to the constraints (30) and (31). We noted in passing that when the

damped-oscillatory contribution to g2 was set equal to zero, the optimization problem could
be solved analytically for all space dimensions, leading to a terminal density φ∗ = (d+2)/2d+1.
Under the assumption that such a g2 was a realizable packing, we also observed that this φ∗
(d + 2)/2d+1]
was a lower bound on the maximal density for any sphere packing [i.e., φmax ≥
because the terminal density would have been higher by including the damped-oscillatory

contribution to g2. This conjectural lower bound was noted to provide linear improvement
over Minkowski’s lower bound, but we were not aware of Ball’s similar lower bound [Bal92]

at the time. Since our original 2002 paper, we also learned about other necessary conditions

for the realizability of a point process for a given number density ρ and g2, such as Yamada’s
condition (32). In any event, our brief remarks about lower bounds on sphere packings were

not intended to be mathematically rigorous.

It is our intent here to make our optimization methodology to obtain lower bounds on φmax
more mathematically precise, especially in light of recent developments and the considerations

of the previous two sections. We then apply the optimization procedure to provide alternative

derivations of previous lower bounds as well as a new bound.

We will consider those “test” g2(r)’s that are distributions on Rd depending only on the
1. For any test g2(r), we want to maximize the

radial distance r such that h(r) = g2(r)
corresponding density φ satisfying the following three conditions:

We will call the maximum density the terminal density and denote it by φ∗.

Remarks:

1. The conditions (i)–(iii) are just recapitulations of (25), (30), and (31) for this class of test

functions. We will call condition (ii) the hard-core constraint.

2. When there exist sphere packings with g2 satisfying conditions (i)–(iii) for φ in the interval

[0, φ∗], then we have the lower bound on the maximal density given by

φmax ≥
The best lower bound would be obtained if one could probe the entire class of test functions.

In practice, we will consider here only a small subset of test functions and in particular those

that are amenable to exact asymptotic analysis. In some instances, we will associate with the

terminal density φ∗ an optimized average kissing number Z∗. Thus, whenever inequality (62)
applies, the maximal kissing number Zmax is bounded from below by Z∗, i.e.,

Zmax ≥
In the next subsection, we put forth a conjecture that states when the conditions (i)–(iii) are

necessary and suﬃcient for the existence of disordered sphere packings.

3. Remarkably, the optimization problem deﬁned above is identical to one formulated by Cohn

[Coh02]. In particular, it is the dual of the primal inﬁnite-dimensional linear program that

Cohn employed with Elkies [CE03] to obtain upper bounds on the maximal packing density.

One need only replace S(k) with ˆg

cδ(k), where c plays the role of number density, g is a

tempered distribution and ˆg is its Fourier transform in Cohn’s notation. Thus, even if there

−

does not exist a sphere packing with g2 satisfying conditions (i)–(iii), our formulation has
implications for upper bounds on φmax, which we discuss in Section 6. For ﬁnite-dimensional
linear programs (and many inﬁnite-dimensional ones) there is no “duality gap,” i.e., the optima

of the primal and dual programs are equal. However, in this inﬁnite-dimensional setting, it

is not clear how to prove that there is no duality gap [Coh02]. Therefore, it is rigorously

true that the terminal density φ∗ can never exceed the Cohn-Elkies upper bound, which is a

desirable feature of our formulation, otherwise the terminal density could never correspond to

a rigorous lower bound.

We will show that for the test radial distribution functions considered in this paper, the

Yamada condition (32) is only relevant in one dimension, and even then in just some cases.

A remark about the Yamada condition for sphere packings is in order here. In earlier work

[TS03], we observed that for any sphere packing of congruent spheres, the number variance

for a spherical window of radius R deﬁned by (33) obeys the lower bound

for any R. This is a tight bound for suﬃciently small R and is exact for R
we note here that provided that 2dφRd

5.1 Existence of Disordered Packings in High Dimensions

We have seen that a necessary condition for the existence of a translationally invariant point
process with a speciﬁed positive ρ and nonnegative g2 is that S(k) is nonnegative [cf. (31)].
In other words, given ρ and g2, it does not mean that there are some higher-order functions
g3, g4, . . . for which these one- and two-point correlation functions hold. The function g2
speciﬁes how frequently pair distances of a given length occur statistically in Rd. The third-
order function g3 reveals how these pair separations are linked into triangles. This additional
information generally cannot be inferred from the knowledge of ρ and g2 alone, however.
The fourth-order function g4 controls the assembly of triangles into tetrahedra (and is the
lowest-order correlation function that is sensitive to chirality) but g4 cannot be determined
by only knowing ρ, g2 and g3. In general, gn for any n
3 is not completely determined from
a knowledge of the lower-order correlations functions alone. This is to be contrasted with

≥

general stochastic processes in which nonnegativity of ﬁrst- and second-order statistics (mean

and autocovariance) are necessary and suﬃcient to establish existence because one can always

ﬁnd a Gaussian process with such given ﬁrst- and second-order statistics. For a Gaussian

process, ﬁrst- and second-order statistics determine all of the high-order statistics.

There are a number of results that suggest it is reasonable to conclude that the gener-

ally necessary nonnegativity conditions for the existence of a disordered sphere packing be-

come necessary and suﬃcient for suﬃciently large d. First, the decorrelation principle of the

previous section states that unconstrained correlations in disordered sphere packings vanish

asymptotically in high dimensions and that the gn for any n
a knowledge of ρ and g2. Second, as we noted in Section 4, the necessary Yamada condition
appears to only have relevance in very low dimensions. Third, we will demonstrate below that

3 can be inferred entirely from

≥

other new necessary conditions also seem to be germane only in very low dimensions. Fourth,

we will describe numerical constructions of conﬁgurations of disordered sphere packings on the

torus corresponding to certain test radial distributions functions in low dimensions for den-

sities up to the terminal density. Finally, we will show that certain test radial distributions

functions recover the asymptotic forms of known rigorous bounds. In light of these results,

we propose the following conjecture:

→ ∞

2. Employing the aforementioned optimization procedure with a certain test function g2 and
this conjecture, we obtain in what follows conjectural lower bounds that yield the long-sought

asymptotic exponential improvement on Minkowski’s bound. Before obtaining this result, we

ﬁrst apply the procedure to two simpler test functions that we examined in the past.

5.2 Step Function

The simplest possible choice for a radial distribution function corresponding to a disordered

packing is the following unit step function:

g2(r) = Θ(r

1).

−

(66)

This states that all pair distances beyond the hard-core diameter are equally probable, i.e.,

spatial correlations vanish identically. The corresponding structure factor [cf. condition (iii)]

for this test function in any dimension d is given by [TS02]

S(k) = 1

φ23νΓ(1 + ν)
kν

−

Jν(k),

(67)

where ν = d/2. Since there are no parameters to be optimized here, the terminal density φ∗ is

readily obtained by determining the highest density for which the condition (31) is satisﬁed,

yielding

φ∗ =

1
2d .

Now we show that the Yamada condition (32) is satisﬁed in any dimension for 0

2−d. Consider the more general class of radial distribution functions:

(74)

which provides an alternate derivation of the elementary bound (7).

Using numerical simulations with a ﬁnite but large number of spheres on the torus, we

have been able to construct particle conﬁgurations in which the radial distribution function

(sampled at discretized pair distances) is given by the test function (66) in one, two and

three dimensions for densities up to the terminal density [CTS03, OST06]. The existence

of such a discrete approximation to (66) of course is not conclusive proof of the existence

of such packings in low dimensions, but they are suggestive that the standard nonnegativity

conditions may be suﬃcient to establish existence in this case for densities up to φ∗.

29

5.3 Step Plus Delta Function

An important feature of any dense packing is that the particles form contacts with one another.

Ideally, one would like to enforce strict jamming (see Introduction). The probability that a

pair of particles form such contacts at the pair distance r = 1 for the test function (66) is

strictly zero. Accordingly, let us now consider the test radial distribution function given by

the previous test function plus a delta-function contribution as follows:

g2(r) = Θ(r

1) +

−

Z
s1(1)ρ

δ(r

1).

−

(75)

Here s1(r) is the surface area of a d-dimensional sphere of radius r given by (24) and Z is a
parameter, which is the average kissing number. Because we allow for interparticle contacts
via the second term in (75), the terminal density is expected to be greater than 2−d, which

will indeed be the case. The corresponding structure factor [cf. (iii)] for this test function in

any dimension d is given by [TS02]

S(k) = 1

Jν(k) +

Under the constraint that the minimum of S(k) occurs at k = 0, then we have the exact

results

φ∗ =

2d+1 ,

Z∗ =

d
2

.

(79)

We see that at the terminal density, the average kissing number Z∗ = d/2, which does not

even meet the local jamming criterion described in the Introduction.

The Yamada condition (32) is violated only for d = 1 for the test function (75) at the

terminal density speciﬁed by (79). It is easy to verify directly that the Yamada condition

becomes less restrictive as the dimension increases from d = 2. Interestingly, we have also

shown via numerical simulations that there exist sphere packings possessing radial distribution

functions given by the test function (75) (in the discrete approximation) in two and three

dimensions for densities up to the terminal density [OST06]. This is suggestive that Conjecture

5.1 for this test function may in fact be stronger than is required.

30

In the high-dimensional limit, we invoke Conjecture 5.1 and the terminal density given

by (79), yielding the conjectural lower bound

φmax ≥

d + 2
2d+1 .

(80)

This lower bound provides the same type of linear improvement over Minkowski’s lower bound

as does Ball’s lower bound [Bal92].

5.4 Step Plus Delta Function with a Gap

The previous test function (75) provided an optimal average kissing number Z∗ = d/2 that did

not even meet the local jamming criterion. Experience with disordered jammed packings in low

dimensions reveals that the kissing number as well as the density can be substantially increased

if there is there is a low probability of ﬁnding noncontacting particles from a typical particle at

radial distances just larger than the nearest-neighbor distance. This small-distance negative

correlation is clearly manifested in the graph of g2(r) for the three-dimensional maximally
random jammed packing (Figure 4) for values of r approximately between 1.1 and 1.5. We

would like to idealize this small-distance negative correlation in such a way that it is amenable

to exact asymptotic analysis. Accordingly, we consider a test radial distribution function that

is similar to the previous one [cf. (75)] but one in which there is a gap between the location

of the unit step function and the delta function at ﬁnite d, i.e.,

g2(r) = Θ(r

σ) +

−

Z
s1(1)ρ

δ(r

1).

−

(81)

The expression contains two adjustable parameters, σ

1 and Z, which must obviously be

constrained to be nonnegative. According to the decorrelation principle of Section 4, the

≥

location of the step function r = σ must approach unity asymptotically, i.e., it must approach

the previous test function (75). However, as we have emphasized, the manner in which the test

function (81) approaches (75) is crucial. Indeed, we will see that the presence of a gap between

the unit step function and delta function will indeed lead asymptotically to substantially higher

terminal densities.

The structure factor is given by

(82)

The goal now is to ﬁnd the optimal values of the the adjustable nonnegative parameters Z and

σ that maximize the density φ subject to the constraint (iii). This search in two-dimensional

31

parameter space can be reduced by imposing the further condition that a minimum of the

structure factor occurs at k = 0. The MacLaurin expansion of expression (82) gives

the real solutions of (89). Figure 5 shows the optimized structure factor for d = 12 and

d = 24. Our numerical examination of S(k) for a wide range of d values has consistently

shown that the ﬁrst minimum for positive k is the deepest one. Although we have not proven

this rigorously, we assume that this is a general result.

We should note that the Yamada condition (32) is violated only for d = 1 for the test

function (81) for the terminal density φ∗ and associated optimized parameters σ∗ and Z∗

[calculated via (84)]. One can again verify directly that the Yamada condition becomes less

restrictive as the dimension increases from d = 2. However, although the test function (81)

for d = 2 with optimized parameters φ∗ = 0.74803, σ∗ = 1.2946 and Z∗ = 4.0148 satisﬁes the

Yamada condition, it cannot correspond to a sphere packing because it violates local geometric

constraints speciﬁed by σ∗ and Z∗. Speciﬁcally, for an average kissing number of 4.0148, there

must be particles that are in contact with at least ﬁve others. But no arrangement of the ﬁve

exists which is consistent with the assumed pair correlation function (step plus delta function

with a gap from 1 to 1.2946). Simple geometric considerations show that either some pairs

of the ﬁve would be forced into the gap, or they would be restricted to ﬁxed separations that

would correspond to undesired delta functions beyond the gap. To our knowledge, this is

the ﬁrst example of a test radial distribution function that satisﬁes the two standard non-

negativity conditions (30) and (31) and the Yamada condition (32), but cannot correspond to

a point process. Thus, there is at least one previously unarticulated necessary condition that

has been violated in the low dimension d = 2.

In three dimensions one obtains φ∗ = 0.5758254, σ∗ = 1.246997, and Z∗ = 7.932582.

The last of these requires that some nonzero fraction of the spheres must have at least 8

contacting neighbors. We have veriﬁed that valid arrangements of both 8 and 9 contacts are

possible, thereby avoiding the analog of the violation encountered in d = 2. As is the case

with the Yamada condition (32), this additional necessary condition appears to lose relevance

as d increases.

The terminal density φ∗ and the associated optimized parameters σ∗ and Z∗ are listed

in Table 3 for selected values of the space dimension between d = 3 and d = 200. Note that

for d

56, the terminal density lies below the density of the densest known packing. For

×

d = 56, the densest arrangement is a lattice (designated by L56,2(M) [Neb98]) with density
10−11, which is about twice as large as φ∗, as shown in the table. However,
φ = 2.327670
for d > 56, φ∗ can be larger than the density of the densest known arrangement. For d = 60,
the densest known packing is again a lattice (designated by L56,2(M) [CS98]) with density
10−13, which is about ﬁve times smaller than φ∗, as shown in the table. The
φ = 2.966747
next dimension for which data is available is d = 64, where the densest known packing is the
10−12, which is about six times larger than
Ne64 lattice [Neb98] with density φ = 1.326615
φ∗. The table also reveals exponential improvement of the terminal density φ∗ over the one
for the gapless case, i.e., φ∗ = (d + 2)/2d+1. The crucial question is whether such exponential
improvement persists in the high-dimensional limit.

This formula provides an excellent approximation for kmin. For example, for d = 200 (or

1.003189733 as well as the numerical search solution σ∗ = 1.008510 into this formula predicts
kmin = 108.4368917. This value is to be compared to the numerical search solution of kmin =
108.4395. This supports the fact that the higher-order terms in the aforementioned linearized

forms of the Bessel functions are negligibly small. Indeed, we expect that this can be rigorously

proved, but we shall not do so here. We will assume the validity of the linearized forms in the

asymptotics displayed below.

the maximal kissing number of 20.2075...d [Wyn65]. Note that such a disordered packing would

be substantially hyperstatic (the average kissing number is greater than 2d [DST05]) and

therefore would be appreciably diﬀerent from a maximally random jammed packing [TTD00,

Tor02], which is isostatic (see Section 4.3) and hence signﬁcantly smaller in density.

6 Discussion

Our results have immediate implications for the linear programming bounds of Cohn and

Elkies [CE03], regardless of the validity of Conjecture 5.1. As we noted earlier, our optimiza-

tion procedure is precisely the dual of the their primal linear programming upper bound. The

existence of our test functions (75) and (81) that satisfy the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of

Section 5 for densities up to the terminal density φ∗ narrows the duality gap [cf. (79) and

(115)]. In particular, inequality (115) provides the greatest lower bound known for the dual

linear program. Moreover, the existence of the inequalities (80) and (115) proves that linear

programming bounds cannot possibly match the Minkowski lower bound for any dimension d.

38

Finally, this link to the Cohn-Elkies formulation proves that the terminal density φ∗ can never

exceed the Cohn-Elkies upper bound, which obviously must be true if the terminal density

corresponds to a rigorous lower bound.

Conjecture 5.1 concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings is plausible for a

number of reasons: (i) the decorrelation principle of Section 4.3; (ii) the necessary Yamada

condition appears to only have relevance in very low dimensions; (iii) other new necessary

conditions described in Section 5.4 also seem to be germane only in very low dimensions; (iv)

there are numerical constructions of conﬁgurations of disordered sphere packings on the torus

corresponding to these test radial distributions functions in low dimensions for densities up to

the terminal density [CTS03, OST06]; and (v) the test radial distributions functions (66) and

(75) recover the asymptotic forms of known rigorous bounds. Concerning the latter point, if

Conjecture 5.1 is false, it is certainly not revealed by the results produced by the test functions

(66) and (75) because the forms of known rigorous results, obtained using completely diﬀerent

techniques, are recovered. If Conjecture 5.1 is false, why would it suddenly be revealed by the

introduction of a gap in the test radial distribution function [cf. (81)] relative to (75)? This

would seem to be unlikely and lends credibility to the conjecture in our view.

Conjecture 5.1, the particular choice (81) and our optimization procedure leads to a lower

bound on the maximal density that improves on the Minkowski bound by an exponential

factor. Our results suggest that the densest packings in suﬃciently high dimensions may be

disordered rather than periodic, implying the existence of disordered classical ground states

for some continuous potentials. A byproduct of our procedure is an associated lower bound

on the maximal kissing number, which is superior to the currently best known result. By

no means is the choice (81) optimal. For example, one may be able to improve our putative

lower bound by allowing the test function to be some positive function smaller than unity for

1

r

≤

≤

σ. Of course, it would be desirable to choose test functions that make asymptotic

analysis exactly rather than numerically tractable.

Our putative exponential improvement over Minkowksi’s bound is striking and should

provide some impetus to determine the validity of Conjecture 5.1. As a ﬁrst step in this

direction, it would be fruitful if one could show that for suﬃciently small densities, the two

standard nonnegativity conditions on the pair correlation function g2 are suﬃcient to assure
the existence of a point process, whether it is a sphere packing or not. Another problem
worth pursuing is the demonstration of the existence of a pair interaction potential in Rd
corresponding to a sphere packing for a given ρ and g2 provided that ρ and g2 are suﬃciently
small. Such a proof may be possible following the methods that Koralov [Kor05] used for the

39

lattice setting. It would also be proﬁtable to pursue the construction of disordered sphere
packings with densities that exceed 1/2d for suﬃciently large d.

The ﬁrst term of the expansion (A-20) is the dominant one and is identical to the estimate

given in (A-16). The ﬁrst term of (A-20) is about 66 times larger than the second term in

absolute value and the second term is about 7 times larger than the third term in absolute

value. Substitution of the constant a1 into (A-20) yields the more reﬁned estimate

C1 =

1.123958144.

(A-21)

This reﬁned estimate diﬀers from the dominant ﬁrst-term estimate given in (A-19) in the third

signiﬁcant ﬁgure. One could continue correcting this estimate by including additional terms

in the asymptotic expansion but this quickly becomes tedious and is not necessary because,

as we show at the end of Section 5, the precise value of C1 is not relevant for the putative
exponential improvement of Minkowski’s lower bound on the density, as speciﬁed by (116).
