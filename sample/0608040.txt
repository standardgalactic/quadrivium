Introduction

Let X be a nice topological space (for example, a CW complex). One goal of algebraic topology is to study
the topology of X by means of algebraic invariants, such as the singular cohomology groups Hn(X; G) of X
with coeﬃcients in an abelian group G. These cohomology groups have proven to be an extremely useful
tool, due largely to the fact that they enjoy excellent formal properties (which have been axiomatized by
Eilenberg and Steenrod, see [26]), and the fact that they tend to be very computable. However, the usual
deﬁnition of Hn(X; G) in terms of singular G-valued cochains on X is perhaps somewhat unenlightening.
This raises the following question: can we understand the cohomology group Hn(X; G) in more conceptual
terms?

As a ﬁrst step toward answering this question, we observe that Hn(X; G) is a representable functor
of X. That is, there exists an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(G, n) and a universal cohomology class η ∈
Hn(K(G, n); G) such that, for any nice topological space X, pullback of η determines a bijection

[X, K(G, n)] → Hn(X; G).

Here [X, K(G, n)] denotes the set of homotopy classes of maps from X to K(G, n). The space K(G, n) can
be characterized up to homotopy equivalence by the above property, or by the the formula

πkK(G, n) ≃

if k 6= n
∗
G if k = n.

(

In the case n = 1, we can be more concrete. An Eilenberg MacLane space K(G, 1) is called a classifying
space for G, and is typically denoted by BG. The universal cover of BG is a contractible space EG, which
carries a free action of the group G by covering transformations. We have a quotient map π : EG → BG.
Each ﬁber of π is a discrete topological space, on which the group G acts simply transitively. We can
summarize the situation by saying that EG is a G-torsor over the classifying space BG. For every continuous
X : EG ×BG X has the structure of a G-torsor on X: that is, it is a space
map X → BG, the ﬁber product
endowed with a free action of G and a homeomorphism
X/G ≃ X. This construction determines a map
from [X, BG] to the set of isomorphism classes of G-torsors on X. If X is a well-behaved space (such as a
CW complex), then this map is a bijection. We therefore have (at least) three diﬀerent ways of thinking
about a cohomology class η ∈ H1(X; G):

e

e

(1) As a G-valued singular cocycle on X, which is well-deﬁned up to coboundaries.

(2) As a continuous map X → BG, which is well-deﬁned up to homotopy.

(3) As a G-torsor on X, which is well-deﬁned up to isomorphism.

These three points of view are equivalent if the space X is suﬃciently nice. However, they are generally quite
diﬀerent from one another. The singular cohomology of a space X is constructed using continuous maps
from simplices ∆k into X. If there are not many maps into X (for example if every path in X is constant),
then we cannot expect singular cohomology to tell us very much about X. The second deﬁnition uses maps
from X into the classifying space BG, which (ultimately) relies on the existence of continuous real-valued
functions on X. If X does not admit many real-valued functions, then the set of homotopy classes [X, BG]
is also not a very useful invariant. For such spaces, the third approach is the most powerful: there is a good
theory of G-torsors on an arbitrary topological space X.

There is another reason for thinking about H1(X; G) in the language of G-torsors: it continues to make
X is a G-torsor on a topological
sense in situations where the traditional ideas of topology break down. If
X with a
space X, then the projection map
X determines an action of G on F. The sheaf F (with its G-action)
sheaf of sets F on X. The action of G on
and the space
X (with its G-action) determine each other, up to canonical isomorphism. Consequently, we
can formulate the deﬁnition of a G-torsor in terms of the category ShvSet(X) of sheaves of sets on X, without

X → X is a local homeomorphism; we may therefore identify

ever mentioning the topological space X itself. The same deﬁnition makes sense in any category which bears
for example, in any
a suﬃciently strong resemblance to the category of sheaves on a topological space:
Grothendieck topos. This observation allows us to construct a theory of torsors in a variety of nonstandard
contexts, such as the ´etale topology of algebraic varieties (see [2]).

Describing the cohomology of X in terms of the sheaf theory of X has still another advantage, which comes
into play even when the space X is assumed to be a CW complex. For a general space X, isomorphism classes
of G-torsors on X are classiﬁed not by the singular cohomology H1
sing(X; G), but by the sheaf cohomology
H1
sheaf(X; G) of X with coeﬃcients in the constant sheaf G associated to G. This sheaf cohomology is deﬁned
more generally for any sheaf of groups G on X. Moreover, we have a conceptual interpretation of H1
sheaf(X; G)
in general: it classiﬁes G-torsors on X (that is, sheaves F on X which carry an action of G and locally admit
a G-equivariant isomorphism F ≃ G) up to isomorphism. The general formalism of sheaf cohomology is
extremely useful, even if we are interested only in the case where X is a nice topological space: it includes,
for example, the theory of cohomology with coeﬃcients in a local system on X.

Let us now attempt to obtain a similar interpretation for cohomology classes η ∈ H2(X; G). What should
play the role of a G-torsor in this case? To answer this question, we return to the situation where X is a CW
complex, so that η can be identiﬁed with a continuous map X → K(G, 2). We can think of K(G, 2) as the
classifying space of a group: not the discrete group G, but instead the classifying space BG (which, if built
in a suﬃciently careful way, comes equipped with the structure of a topological abelian group). Namely, we
can identify K(G, 2) with the quotient E/BG, where E is a contractible space with a free action of BG. Any
cohomology class η ∈ H2(X; G) determines a map X → K(G, 2) (which is well-deﬁned up to homotopy),
and we can form the pullback
X as a torsor over X: not for the discrete
group G, but instead for its classifying space BG.

X = E ×BG X. We now think of

e

To complete the analogy with our analysis in the case n = 1, we would like to interpret the ﬁbration
X → X as deﬁning some kind of sheaf F on the space X. This sheaf F should have the property that for
each x ∈ X, the stalk Fx can be identiﬁed with the ﬁber
Xx ≃ BG. Since the space BG is not discrete (or
homotopy equivalent to a discrete space), the situation cannot be adequately described in the usual language
e
of set-valued sheaves. However, the classifying space BG is almost discrete: since the homotopy groups πiBG
vanish for i > 1, we can recover BG (up to homotopy equivalence) from its fundamental groupoid. This
suggests that we might try to think about F as a “groupoid-valued sheaf” on X, or a stack (in groupoids)
on X.

e

e

Remark. The condition that each stalk Fx be equivalent to a classifying space BG can be summarized by
saying that F is a gerbe on X: more precisely, it is a gerbe banded by the constant sheaf G associated to G.
We refer the reader to [31] for an explanation of this terminology, and a proof that such gerbes are indeed
classiﬁed by the sheaf cohomology group H2

sheaf(X; G).

For larger values of n, even the language of stacks is not suﬃcient to describe the nature of the sheaf F
associated to the ﬁbration
X → X. To address the situation, Grothendieck proposed (in his infamous letter
to Quillen; see [35]) that there should be a theory of n-stacks on X, for every integer n ≥ 0. Moreover, for
every sheaf of abelian groups G on X, the cohomology group Hn+1
sheaf(X; G) should have an interpreation as
classifying a special type of n-stack: namely, the class of n-gerbes banded by G (for a discussion in the case
n = 2, we refer the reader to [13]; we will discuss the general case in §7.2.2). In the special case where the
space X is a point (and where we restrict our attention to n-stacks in groupoids), the theory of n-stacks on
X should recover the classical homotopy theory of n-types: that is, CW complexes Z such that the homotopy
groups πi(Z, z) vanish for i > n (and every base point z ∈ Z). More generally, we should think of an n-stack
(in groupoids) on a general space X as a “sheaf of n-types” on X.

e

When n = 0, an n-stack on a topological space X simply means a sheaf of sets on X. The collection of
all such sheaves can be organized into a category ShvSet(X), and this category is a prototypical example of
a Grothendieck topos. The main goal of this book is to obtain an analogous understanding of the situation
for n > 0. More precisely, we would like answers to the following questions:

(Q1) Given a topological space X, what should we mean by a “sheaf of n-types” on X?

2

(Q2) Let Shv≤n(X) denote the collection of all sheaves of n-types on X. What sort of a mathematical object

is Shv≤n(X)?

(Q3) What special features (if any) does Shv≤n(X) possess?

Our answers to questions (Q2) and (Q3) may be summarized as follows (our answer to (Q1) is more

diﬃcult to summarize, and we will avoid discussing it for the moment):

(A2) The collection Shv≤n(X) has the structure of an ∞-category.

(A3) The ∞-category Shv≤n(X) is an example of an (n + 1)-topos: that is, an ∞-category which satisﬁes
higher categorical analogues of Giraud’s axioms for Grothendieck topoi (see Theorem 6.4.1.5).

Remark. Grothendieck’s vision has been realized in various ways, thanks to the work of a number of
mathematicians (most notably Brown, Joyal, and Jardine: see for example [41]), and their work can also
be used to provide answers to questions (Q1) and (Q2) (for more details, we refer the reader to §6.5.2).
Question (Q3) has also been addressed (at least in limiting case n = ∞) by To¨en and Vezzosi (see [78]) and
in published work of Rezk.

To provide more complete versions of the answers (A2) and (A3), we will need to develop the language
of higher category theory. This is generally regarded as a technical and forbidding subject, but fortunately
we will only need a small fragment of it. More precisely, we will need a theory of (∞, 1)-categories: higher
categories C for which the k-morphisms of C are required to be invertible for k > 1. In §1, we will present
such a theory: namely, one can deﬁne an ∞-category to be a simplicial set satisfying a weakened version of
the Kan extension condition (see Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4; simplicial sets satisfying this condition are also called
weak Kan complexes or quasicategories in the literature). Our intention is that §1 can be used as a short
“user’s guide” to ∞-categories: it contains many of the basic deﬁnitions, and explains how many ideas from
classical category theory can be extended to the ∞-categorical context. To simplify the exposition, we have
deferred many proofs until later chapters, which contain a more thorough account of the theory. The hope
is that §1 will be useful to readers who want to get the ﬂavor of the subject, without becoming overwhelmed
by technical details.

In §2 we will shift our focus slightly: rather than study individual examples of ∞-categories, we consider
families of ∞-categories {CD}D∈D parametrized by the objects of another ∞-category D. We might expect
such a family to be given by a map of ∞-categories p : C → D: given such a map, we can then deﬁne each
CD to be the ﬁber product C ×D{D}. This deﬁnition behaves poorly in general (for example, the ﬁbers CD
need not be ∞-categories), but it behaves well if we make suitable assumptions on the map p. Our goal in
§2 is to study some of these assumptions in detail, and show that they lead to a good relative version of
higher category theory.

One motivation for the theory of ∞-categories is that it arises naturally in addressing questions like (Q2)
above. More precisely, given a collection of mathematical objects {Fα} whose deﬁnition has a homotopy-
theoretic ﬂavor (like n-stacks on a topological space X), we can often organize the collection {Fα} into an
∞-category (in other words, we can ﬁnd an ∞-category C whose vertices correspond to the objects Fα).
Another important example is provided by higher category theory itself: the collection of all ∞-categories
can itself be organized into a (very large) ∞-category, which we will denote by Cat∞. Our goal in §3 is to
study Cat∞ and to show that it can be characterized by a universal property: namely, functors χ : D → Cat∞
are classiﬁed, up to equivalence, by certain kinds of ﬁbrations C → D (see Theorem 3.2.0.1 for a more precise
statement). Roughly speaking, this correspondence assigns to a ﬁbration C → D the functor χ given by the
formula χ(D) = C ×D{D}.

Classically, category theory is a useful tool not so much because of the light it sheds on any particular
mathematical discipline, but instead because categories are so ubiquitous: mathematical objects in many
diﬀerent settings (sets, groups, smooth manifolds, etcetera) can be organized into categories. Moreover,
many elementary mathematical concepts can be described in purely categorical terms, and therefore make
sense in each of these settings. For example, we can form products of sets, groups, and smooth manifolds:

3

each of these notions can simply be described as a Cartesian product in the relevant category. Cartesian
products are a special case of the more general notion of limit, which plays a central role in classical category
theory. In §4, we will make a systematic study of limits (and the dual theory of colimits) in the ∞-categorical
setting. We will also introduce the more general theory of Kan extensions, in both absolute and relative
versions; this theory plays a key technical role throughout the later parts of the book.

In some sense, the material of §1 through §4 of this book should be regarded as purely formal. Our main
results can be summarized as follows: there exists a reasonable theory of ∞-categories, and it behaves in
more or less the same way as the theory of ordinary categories. Many of the ideas that we introduce are
straightforward generalizations of their ordinary counterparts (though proofs in the ∞-categorical setting
often require a bit of dexterity in manipulating simplicial sets), which will be familiar to mathematicians
who are acquainted with ordinary category theory (as presented, for example, in [52]). In §5, we introduce
∞-categorical analogues of more sophisticated concepts from classical category theory: presheaves, Pro and
Ind-categories, accessible and presentable categories, and localizations. The main theme is that most of the
∞-categories which appear “in nature” are large, but are determined by small subcategories. Taking careful
advantage of this fact will allow us to deduce a number of pleasant results, such as an ∞-categorical version
of the adjoint functor theorem (Corollary 5.5.2.9).

In §6 we come to the heart of the book: the study of ∞-topoi, the ∞-categorical analogues of Grothendieck
topoi. The theory of ∞-topoi is our answer to the question (Q3) in the limiting case n = ∞ (we will also
study the analogous notion for ﬁnite values of n). Our main result is an analogue of Giraud’s theorem, which
asserts the equivalence of “extrinsic” and “intrinsic” approaches to the subject (Theorem 6.1.0.6). Roughly
speaking, an ∞-topos is an ∞-category which “looks like” the ∞-category of all homotopy types. We will
show that this intuition is justiﬁed in the sense that it is possible to reconstruct a large portion of classical
homotopy theory inside an arbitrary ∞-topos. In other words, an ∞-topos is a world in which one can “do”
homotopy theory (much as an ordinary topos can be regarded as a world in which one can “do” other types
of mathematics).

In §7 we will discuss the relationship between our theory of ∞-topoi and ideas from classical topology.
We will show that, if X is a paracompact space, then the ∞-topos of “sheaves of homotopy types” on X
can be interpreted in terms of the classical homotopy theory of spaces over X. Another main theme is
that various ideas from geometric topology (such as dimension theory and shape theory) can be described
naturally in the language of ∞-topoi. We will also formulate and prove “nonabelian” generalizations of
classical cohomological results, such as Grothendieck’s vanishing theorem for the cohomology of Noetherian
topological spaces, and the proper base change theorem.

Prerequisites and Suggested Reading

We have made an eﬀort to keep this book as self-contained as possible. The main prerequisite is familiarity
with the classical homotopy theory of simplicial sets (good references include [56] and [32]; we have also
provided a very brief review in §A.2.7). The remaining material that we need is either described in the
appendix, or developed in the body of the text. However, our exposition of this background material is often
somewhat terse, and the reader might beneﬁt from consulting other treatments of the same ideas. Some
suggestions for further reading are listed below.

Warning. The list of references below is woefully incomplete. We have not attempted, either here or in
the body of the text, to give a comprehensive survey of the literature on higher category theory. We have
also not attempted to trace all of the ideas presented to their origins, or to present a detailed history of the
subject. Many of the topics presented in this book have appeared elsewhere, or belong to the mathematical
folklore; it should not be assumed that uncredited results are due to the author.

• Classical Category Theory: Large portions of this book are devoted to providing ∞-categorical
generalizations of the basic notions of category theory. A good reference for many of the concepts we
use is MacLane’s book [52] (see also [1] and [54] for some of the more advanced material of §5).

4

• Classical Topos Theory: Our main goal in this book is to describe an ∞-categorical version of
topos theory. Familiarity with classical topos theory is not strictly necessary (we will deﬁne all of the
relevant concepts as we need them), but will certainly be helpful. Good references include [2] and [53].

• Model Categories: Quillen’s theory of model categories provides a useful tool for studying speciﬁc
examples of ∞-categories, including the theory of ∞-categories itself. We will summarize the theory
of model categories in §A.2; more complete references include [40], [38], and [32].

• Higher Category Theory: There are many approaches to the theory of higher categories, some
of which look quite diﬀerent from the theory presented in this book. Several other possibilities are
presented in the survey article [48]. More detailed accounts can be found in [49], [71], and [75].

In this book, we consider only (∞, 1)-categories: that is, higher categories in which all k-morphisms
are assumed to be invertible for k > 1. There are a number of convenient ways to formalize this idea:
via simplicial categories (see for example [21] and [7]), via Segal categories ([71]), via complete Segal
spaces ([64]), or via the theory of ∞-categories presented in this book (other references include [43],
[44], [60], and [10]). The relationship between these various approaches is described in [8], and an
axiomatic framework which encompasses all of them is described in [76].

• Higher Topos Theory: The idea of studying a topological space X via the theory of sheaves of
n-types (or n-stacks) on X goes back at least to Grothendieck ([35]), and has been taken up a number
of times in recent years. For small values of n, we refer the reader to [31], [74], [13], [45], and [61]. For
the case n = ∞, we refer the reader to [14], [41], [39], and [77]. A very readable introduction to some
of these ideas can be found in [4].

Higher topos theory itself can be considered an abstraction of this idea: rather than studying sheaves
of n-types on a particular topological space X, we instead study general n-categories with the same
formal properties. This idea has been implemented in the work of To¨en and Vezzosi (see [78] and
[79]), resulting in a theory which is essentially equivalent to the one presented in this book. (A rather
diﬀerent variation on this idea in the case n = 2 can be also be found in [11].) The subject has also
been greatly inﬂuenced by the unpublished ideas of Charles Rezk.

Terminology

A few comments on some of the terminology which appears in this book:

• The word topos will always mean Grothendieck topos.

• We let Set∆ denote the category of simplicial sets. If J is a linearly ordered set, we let ∆J denote
the simplicial set given by the nerve of J, so that the collection of n-simplices of ∆J can be identiﬁed
with the collection of all nondecreasing maps {0, . . . , n} → J. We will frequently apply this notation
when J is a subset of {0, . . . , n}; in this case, we can identify ∆J with a subsimplex of the standard
n-simplex ∆n (at least if J 6= ∅; if J = ∅ then ∆J is empty).

• We will refer to a category C as accessible or presentable if it is locally accessible or locally presentable

in the terminology of [54].

• Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the term ∞-category will be used to indicate a higher category in which all

n-morphisms are invertible for n > 1.

• We will study higher category theory in Joyal’s setting of quasicategories. However, we do not always
follow Joyal’s terminology. In particular, we will use the term ∞-category to refer to what Joyal calls a
quasicategory (which are, in turn, the same as the weak Kan complex of Boardman and Vogt); we will
use the terms inner ﬁbration and inner anodyne map where Joyal uses mid-ﬁbration and mid-anodyne
map.

5

• Let n ≥ 0. We will say that a homotopy type X (described by either a topological space or a Kan
complex) is n-truncated if the homotopy groups πi(X, x) vanish for every point x ∈ X and every i > n.
By convention, we say that X is (−1)-truncated if it is either empty or (weakly) contractible, and
(−2)-truncated if X is (weakly) contractible.

• Let n ≥ 0. We will say that a homotopy type X (described either by a topological space or a Kan
complex) is n-connective if X is nonempty and the homotopy groups πi(X, x) vanish for every point
x ∈ X and every integer i < n. By convention, we will agree that every homotopy type X is (−1)-
connective.

• More generally, we will say that a map of homotopy types f : X → Y is n-truncated (n-connective) if

the homotopy ﬁbers of f are n-truncated (n-connective).

Remark. For n ≥ 1, a homotopy type X is n-connective if and only if it is (n − 1)-connected (in the usual
terminology). In particular, X is 1-connective if and only if it is path connected.

Warning. In this book, we will often be concerned with sheaves on a topological space X (or some
Grothendieck site) that take values in an ∞-category C. The most “universal” case is that in which C
is the ∞-category of S of spaces. Consequently, the term “sheaf on X” without any other qualiﬁers will
typically refer to a sheaf of spaces on X, rather than a sheaf of sets on X. We will see that the collection of
all S-valued sheaves on X can be organized into an ∞-category, which we denote by Shv(X). In particular,
Shv(X) will not denote the ordinary category of set-valued sheaves on X; if we need to consider this latter
object, we will denote it by ShvSet(X).

Chapter 1

An Overview of Higher Category
Theory

This chapter is intended as a general introduction to higher category theory. We begin with what we feel
is the most intuitive approach to the subject, based on topological categories. This approach is easy to
understand, but diﬃcult to work with when one wishes to perform even simple categorical constructions.
As a remedy, we will introduce the more suitable formalism of ∞-categories (called weak Kan complexes in
[10] and quasi-categories in [43]), which provides a more convenient setting for adaptations of sophisticated
category-theoretic ideas. Our goal in §1.1.1 is to introduce both approaches and to explain why they are
equivalent to one another. The proof of this equivalence will rely on a crucial result (Theorem 1.1.5.13)
which we will prove in §2.2.

Our second objective in this chapter is to give the reader an idea of how to work with the formalism of
∞-categories. In §1.2 we will establish a vocabulary which includes ∞-categorical analogues (often direct
generalizations) of most of the important concepts from ordinary category theory. To keep the exposition
brisk, we will postpone the more diﬃcult proofs until later chapters of this book. Our hope is that, after
reading this chapter, a reader who does not wish to be burdened with the details will be able to understand
(at least in outline) some of the more conceptual ideas described in §5 and beyond.

1.1 Foundations for Higher Category Theory

1.1.1 Goals and Obstacles

Recall that a category C consists of the following data:

(1) A collection {X, Y, Z, . . .} whose members are the objects of C. We typically write X ∈ C to indicate

that X is an object of C.

(2) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, a set HomC(X, Y ) of morphisms from X to Y . We will typically
write f : X → Y to indicate that f ∈ HomC(X, Y ), and say that f is a morphism from X to Y .

(3) For every object X ∈ C, an identity morphism idX ∈ HomC(X, X).

(4) For every triple of objects X, Y, Z ∈ C, a composition map

HomC(X, Y ) × HomC(Y, Z) → HomC(X, Z).

Given morphisms f : X → Y and g : Y → Z, we will usually denote the image of the pair (f, g) under
the composition map by gf or g ◦ f .

These data are furthermore required to satisfy the following conditions, which guarantee that composition

is unital and associative:

(5) For every morphism f : X → Y , we have idY ◦f = f = f ◦ idX in HomC(X, Y ).

(6) For every triple of composable morphisms

we have an equality h ◦ (g ◦ f ) = (h ◦ g) ◦ f in HomC(W, Z).

The theory of categories has proven to be a valuable organization tool in many areas of mathematics.
Mathematical structures of virtually any type can be viewed as the objects of a suitable category C, where the
morphisms in C are given by structure-preserving maps. There is a veritable legion of examples of categories
which ﬁt this paradigm:

• The category Set whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are maps of sets.

• The category Grp whose objects are groups and whose morphisms are group homomorphisms.

• The category Top whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are continuous maps.

• The category Cat whose objects are (small) categories and whose morphisms are functors. (Recall that
a functor F from C to D is a map which assigns to each object C ∈ C another object F C ∈ D and
to each morphism f : C → C′ in C a morphism F (f ) : F C → F C′ in D, so that F (idC) = idF C and
F (g ◦ f ) = F (g) ◦ F (f ).)

• . . .

In general, the existence of a morphism f : X → Y in a category C reﬂects some relationship that exists
between the objects X, Y ∈ C. In some contexts, these relationships themselves become basic objects of
study, and can themselves be fruitfully organized into categories:

13

Example 1.1.1.1. Let Grp be the category whose objects are groups and whose morphisms are group
homomorphisms. In the theory of groups, one is often concerned only with group homomorphisms up to
for every pair of groups G, H ∈ Grp,
conjugacy. The relation of conjugacy can be encoded as follows:
there is a category Map(G, H) whose objects are group homomorphisms from G to H (that is, elements
of HomGrp(G, H)), where a morphism from f : G → H to f ′ : G → H is an element h ∈ H such that
hf (g)h−1 = f ′(g) for all g ∈ G. Note that two group homomorphisms f, f ′ : G → H are conjugate if and
only if they are isomorphic when viewed as objects of Map(G, H).

Example 1.1.1.2. Let X and Y be topological spaces, and let f0, f1 : X → Y be continuous maps. Recall
that a homotopy from f0 to f1 is a continuous map f : X × [0, 1] → Y such that f |X × {0} coincides with
f0 and f |X × {1} coincides with f1. In algebraic topology, one is often concerned not with the category Top
of topological spaces, but with its homotopy category: that is, the category obtained by identifying those
pairs of morphisms f0, f1 : X → Y which are homotopic to one another. For many purposes, it is better to
do something a little bit more sophisticated: namely, one can form a category Map(X, Y ) whose objects are
continuous maps f : X → Y and whose morphisms are given by (homotopy classes of) homotopies.

Example 1.1.1.3. Given a pair of categories C and D, the collection of all functors from C to D is itself
naturally organized into a category Fun(C, D), where the morphisms are given by natural transformations.
(Recall that, given a pair of functors F, G : C → D, a natural transformation α : F → G is a collection of
morphisms {αC : F (C) → G(C)}C∈C which satisfy the following condition: for every morphism f : C → C′
in C, the diagram

F (C)

F (f )

F (C′)

αC

αC′

G(C)

G(f )

/ G(C′)

commutes in D.)

In each of these examples, the objects of interest can naturally be organized into what is called a 2-
category (or bicategory): we have not only a collection of objects and a notion of morphisms between objects,
but also a notion of morphisms between morphisms, which are called 2-morphisms. The vision of higher
category theory is that there should exist a good notion of n-category for all n ≥ 0, in which we have not
only objects, morphisms, and 2-morphisms, but also k-morphisms for all k ≤ n. Finally, in some sort of
limit we might hope to obtain a theory of ∞-categories, where there are morphisms of all orders.

Example 1.1.1.4. Let X be a topological space, and 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. We can extract an n-category π≤nX
(roughly) as follows. The objects of π≤nX are the points of X. If x, y ∈ X, then the morphisms from x to
y in π≤nX are given by continuous paths [0, 1] → X starting at x and ending at y. The 2-morphisms are
given by homotopies of paths, the 3-morphisms by homotopies between homotopies, and so forth. Finally,
if n < ∞, then two n-morphisms of π≤nX are considered to be the same if and only if they are homotopic
to one another.

If n = 0, then π≤nX can be identiﬁed with the set π0X of path components of X. If n = 1, then our
deﬁnition of π≤nX agrees with usual deﬁnition for the fundamental groupoid of X. For this reason, π≤nX is
often called the fundamental n-groupoid of X. It is an n-groupoid (rather than a mere n-category) because
every k-morphism of π≤kX has an inverse (at least “up to homotopy”).

There are many approaches to realizing the theory of higher categories. We might begin by deﬁning
a 2-category to be a “category enriched over Cat.” In other words, we consider a collection of objects
together with a category of morphisms Hom(A, B) for any two objects A and B, and composition functors
cABC : Hom(A, B)× Hom(B, C) → Hom(A, C) (to simplify the discussion, we will ignore identity morphisms
for a moment). These functors are required to satisfy an associative law, which asserts that for any quadruple

14

(A, B, C, D) of objects, the diagram

Hom(A, B) × Hom(B, C) × Hom(C, D)

/ Hom(A, C) × Hom(C, D)

Hom(A, B) × Hom(B, D)

/ Hom(A, D)

commutes; in other words, one has an equality of functors

cACD ◦ (cABC × 1) = cABD ◦ (1 × cBCD)

from Hom(A, B) × Hom(B, C) × Hom(C, D) to Hom(A, D). This leads to the deﬁnition of a strict 2-category.
At this point, we should object that the deﬁnition of a strict 2-category violates one of the basic philo-
sophical principles of category theory: one should never demand that two functors F and F ′ be equal to
one another. Instead one should postulate the existence of a natural isomorphism between F and F ′. This
means that the associative law should not take the form of an equation, but of additional structure: a col-
lection of isomorphisms γABCD : cACD ◦ (cABC × 1) ≃ cABD ◦ (1 × cBCD). We should further demand that
the isomorphisms γABCD be functorial in the quadruple (A, B, C, D) and satisfy certain higher associativity
conditions, which generalize the “Pentagon axiom” described in §A.1.3. After formulating the appropriate
conditions, we arrive at the deﬁnition of a weak 2-category.

Let us contrast the notions of “strict 2-category” and “weak 2-category.” The former is easier to deﬁne,
since we do not have to worry about the higher associativity conditions satisﬁed by the transformations
γABCD. On the other hand, the latter notion seems more natural if we take the philosophy of category
theory seriously.
In this case, we happen to be lucky: the notions of “strict 2-category” and “weak 2-
category” turn out to be equivalent. More precisely, any weak 2-category is equivalent (in the relevant sense)
to a strict 2-category. The choice of deﬁnition can therefore be regarded as a question of aesthetics.

We now plunge onward to 3-categories. Following the above program, we might deﬁne a strict 3-category
to consist of a collection of objects together with strict 2-categories Hom(A, B) for any pair of objects A
and B, together with a strictly associative composition law. Alternatively, we could seek a deﬁnition of weak
3-category by allowing Hom(A, B) to be only a weak 2-category, requiring associativity only up to natural
2-isomorphisms, which satisfy higher associativity laws up to natural 3-isomorphisms, which in turn satisfy
still higher associativity laws of their own. Unfortunately, it turns out that these notions are not equivalent.
Both of these approaches have serious drawbacks. The obvious problem with weak 3-categories is that
an explicit deﬁnition is extremely complicated (see [33], where a deﬁnition is given along these lines), to
the point where it is essentially unusable. On the other hand, strict 3-categories have the problem of not
being the correct notion: most of the weak 3-categories which occur in nature are not equivalent to strict
3-categories. For example, the fundamental 3-groupoid of the 2-sphere S2 cannot be described using the
language of strict 3-categories. The situation only gets worse (from either point of view) as we pass to
4-categories and beyond.

Fortunately, it turns out that major simpliﬁcations can be introduced if we are willing to restrict our
attention to ∞-categories in which most of the higher morphisms are invertible. Let us henceforth use
the term (∞, n)-category to refer to ∞-categories in which all k-morphisms are invertible for k > n. The
∞-categories described in Example 1.1.1.4 (when n = ∞) are all (∞, 0)-categories. The converse, which
asserts that every (∞, 0)-category has the form π≤∞X for some topological space X, is a generally accepted
principle of higher category theory. Moreover, the ∞-groupoid π≤∞X encodes the entire homotopy type of
X. In other words, (∞, 0)-categories (that is, ∞-categories in which all morphisms are invertible) have been
extensively studied from another point of view: they are essentially the same thing as “spaces” in the sense
of homotopy theory, and there are many equivalent ways to describe them (for example, we can use CW
complexes or simplicial sets).

Convention 1.1.1.5. We will often refer to (∞, 0)-categories as ∞-groupoids and (∞, 2)-categories as ∞-
bicategories. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the generic term ∞-category will mean (∞, 1)-category.

In this book, we will restrict our attention almost entirely to the theory of ∞-categories (in which we

have only invertible n-morphisms for n ≥ 2). Our reasons are threefold:

(1) Allowing noninvertible n-morphisms for n > 1 introduces a number of additional complications to the
theory, at both technical and conceptual levels. As we will see throughout this book, many ideas from
category theory generalize to the ∞-categorical setting in a natural way. However, these generalizations
are not so straightforward if we allow noninvertible 2-morphisms. For example, one must distinguish
between strict and lax ﬁber products, even in the setting of “classical” 2-categories.

(2) For the applications studied in this book, we will not need to consider (∞, n)-categories for n > 2. The
case n = 2 is of some relevance, because the collection of (small) ∞-categories can naturally be viewed
as a (large) ∞-bicategory. However, we will generally be able to exploit this structure in an ad-hoc
manner, without developing any general theory of ∞-bicategories.

(3) For n > 1, the theory of (∞, n)-categories is most naturally viewed as a special case of enriched
(higher) category theory. Roughly speaking, an n-category can be viewed as a category enriched over
(n − 1)-categories. As we explained above, this point of view is inadequate because it requires that
composition satisﬁes an associative law up to equality, while in practice the associativity only holds up
to isomorphism or some weaker notion of equivalence. In other words, to obtain the correct deﬁnition
we need to view the collection of (n − 1)-categories as an n-category, not as an ordinary category.
Consequently, the naive approach is circular: though it does lead to the correct theory of n-categories,
we can only make sense of it if the theory of n-categories is already in place.

Thinking along similar lines, we can view an (∞, n)-category as an ∞-category which is enriched over
(∞, n − 1)-categories. The collection of (∞, n − 1)-categories is itself organized into an (∞, n)-category
Cat(∞,n−1), so at a ﬁrst glance this deﬁnition suﬀers from the same problem of circularity. However,
because the associativity properties of composition are required to hold up to equivalence, rather than
up to arbitrary natural transformation, the noninvertible k-morphisms in Cat(∞,n−1) are irrelevant for
k > 1. We may therefore view an (∞, n)-category as a category enriched over Cat(∞,n−1), where the
latter is regarded as an ∞-category by discarding noninvertible k-morphisms for 2 ≤ k ≤ n. In other
words, the naive inductive deﬁnition of higher category theory is reasonable, provided that we work in
the ∞-categorical setting from the outset. We refer the reader to [75] for a deﬁnition of n-categories
which follows this line of thought.

The theory of enriched ∞-categories is a useful and important one, but will not be treated in this
book. Instead we refer the reader to [50] for an introduction using the same language and formalism
we employ here.

Though we will not need a theory of (∞, n)-categories for n > 1, the case n = 1 is the main subject matter
of this book. Fortunately, the above discussion suggests a deﬁnition. Namely, an ∞-category C should be
consist of a collection of objects, and an ∞-groupoid MapC(X, Y ) for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C. These
∞-groupoids can be identiﬁed with “spaces”, and should be equipped with an associative composition law.
As before, we are faced with two choices as to how to make this precise: do we require associativity on
the nose, or only up to (coherent) homotopy? Fortunately, the answer turns out to be irrelevant: as in the
theory of 2-categories, any ∞-category with a coherently associative multiplication can be replaced by an
equivalent ∞-category with a strictly associative multiplication. We are led to the following:

Deﬁnition 1.1.1.6. A topological category is a category which is enriched over CG, the category of compactly
generated (and weakly Hausdorﬀ) topological spaces. The category of topological categories will be denoted
by Cattop.

More explicitly, a topological category C consists of a collection of objects, together with a (compactly
generated) topological space MapC(X, Y ) for any pair of objects X, Y ∈ C. These mapping spaces must be
equipped with an associative composition law, given by continuous maps

MapC(X0, X1) × MapC(X1, X2) × . . . MapC(Xn−1, Xn) → MapC(X0, Xn)

16

(deﬁned for all n ≥ 0). Here the product is taken in the category of compactly generated topological spaces.

Remark 1.1.1.7. The decision to work with compactly generated topological spaces, rather than arbitrary
spaces, is made in order to facilitate the comparison with more combinatorial approaches to homotopy theory.
This is a purely technical point which the reader may safely ignore.

It is possible to use Deﬁnition 1.1.1.6 as a foundation for higher category theory: that is, to deﬁne an
∞-category to be a topological category. However, this approach has a number of technical disadvantages.
We will describe an alternative (though equivalent) formalism in the next section.

1.1.2 ∞-Categories

Of the numerous formalizations of higher category theory, Deﬁnition 1.1.1.6 is the quickest and most trans-
parent. However, it is one of the most diﬃcult to actually work with: many of the basic constructions of
higher category theory give rise most naturally to (∞, 1)-categories for which the composition of morphisms
is associative only up to (coherent) homotopy (for several examples of this phenomenon, we refer the reader
to §1.2). In order to remain in the world of topological categories, it is necessary to combine these construc-
tions with a “straightening” procedure which produces a strictly associative composition law. Although it
is always possible to do this (see Theorem 2.2.5.1), it is much more technically convenient to work from
the outset within a more ﬂexible theory of (∞, 1)-categories. Fortunately, there are many candidates for
such a theory, including the theory of Segal categories ([71]), the theory of complete Segal spaces ([64]),
and the theory of model categories ([40], [38]). To review all of these notions and their interrelationships
would involve too great a digression from the main purpose of this book. However, the frequency with which
we will encounter sophisticated categorical constructions necessitates the use of one of these more eﬃcient
approaches. We will employ the theory of weak Kan complexes, which goes back to Boardman-Vogt ([10]).
These objects have subsequently been studied more extensively by Joyal ([43] and [44]), who calls them
quasicategories. We will simply call them ∞-categories.

To get a feeling for what an ∞-category C should be, it is useful to consider two extreme cases. If every
morphism in C is invertible, then C is equivalent to the fundamental ∞-groupoid of a topological space X.
In this case, higher category theory reduces to classical homotopy theory. On the other hand, if C has no
nontrivial n-morphisms for n > 1, then C is equivalent to an ordinary category. A general formalism must
capture the features of both of these examples. In other words, we need a class of mathematical objects
which can behave both like categories and like topological spaces. In §1.1.1, we achieved this by “brute
force”: namely, we directly amalgamated the theory of topological spaces and the theory of categories, by
considering topological categories. However, it is possible to approach the problem more directly using the
theory of simplicial sets. We will assume that the reader has some familiarity with the theory of simplicial
sets; a brief review of this theory is included in §A.2.7, and a more extensive introduction can be found in
[32].

The theory of simplicial sets originated as a combinatorial approach to homotopy theory. Given any
topological space X, one can associate a simplicial set Sing X, whose n-simplices are precisely the continuous
maps |∆n| → X, where |∆n| = {(x0, . . . , xn) ∈ [0, 1]n+1|x0 + . . . + xn = 1} is the standard n-simplex.
Moreover, the topological space X is determined, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by Sing X. More
precisely, the singular complex functor X 7→ Sing X admits a left adjoint, which carries every simplicial set
K to its geometric realization |K|. For every topological space X, the counit map | Sing X| → X is a weak
homotopy equivalence. Consequently, if one is only interested in studying topological spaces up to weak
homotopy equivalence, one might as well work simplicial sets instead.

If X is a topological space, then the simplicial set Sing X has an important property, which is captured

by the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 1.1.2.1. Let K be a simplicial set. We say that K is a Kan complex if, for any 0 ≤ i ≤ n and

there exists a dotted arrow as indicated rendering the diagram commutative. Here Λn

i ⊆ ∆n denotes the ith

The singular complex of any topological space X is a Kan complex: this follows from the fact that the
i | is a retract of the simplex |∆n| in the category of topological spaces. Conversely, any Kan complex
horn |Λn
K “behaves like” a space: for example, there are simple combinatorial recipes for extracting homotopy groups
from K (which turn out be isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the topological space |K|). According to
a theorem of Quillen (see [32] for a proof), the singular complex and geometric realization provide mutually
inverse equivalences between the homotopy category of CW complexes and the homotopy category of Kan
complexes.

The formalism of simplicial sets is also closely related to category theory. To any category C, we can
associate a simplicial set N(C), called the nerve of C. For each n ≥ 0, we let N(C)n = MapSet∆(∆n, N(C))
denote the set of all functors [n] → C. Here [n] denotes the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , n}, regarded as a
category in the obvious way. More concretely, N(C)n is the set of all composable sequences of morphisms

C0

f1→ C1 . . .

fn→ Cn

having length n. In this description, the face map di carries the above sequence to

C0

f1→ C1 . . .

fi−1→ Ci−1

fn→ Cn

while the degeneracy si carries it to

C0

f1→ C1 . . .

fi→ Ci

fi+1→ Ci+1

fi+2→ . . .

fn→ Cn.

It is more or less clear from this description that the simplicial set N(C) is just a fancy way of encoding
the structure of C as a category. More precisely, we note that the category C can be recovered (up to
isomorphism) from its nerve N(C). The objects of C are simply the vertices of N(C); that is, the elements
of N(C)0. A morphism from C0 to C1 is given by an edge φ ∈ N(C)1 with d1(φ) = C0 and d0(φ) = C1.
The identity morphism from an object C to itself is given by the degenerate simplex s0(C). Finally, given a
ψ
→ C2, the edge of N(C) corresponding to ψ ◦ φ may be uniquely characterized by the fact
diagram C0
that there exists a 2-simplex σ ∈ N(C)2 with d2(σ) = φ, d0(σ) = ψ, and d1(σ) = ψ ◦ φ.

φ
→ C1

It is not diﬃcult to characterize those simplicial sets which arise as the nerve of a category:

Proposition 1.1.2.2. Let K be a simplicial set. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) There exists a small category C and an isomorphism K ≃ N(C).

(2) For each 0 < i < n and each diagram

Proof. We ﬁrst show that (1) ⇒ (2). Let K be the nerve of a small category C, and let f0 : Λn
i → K be a map
of simplicial sets where 0 < i < n. We wish to show that f0 can be extended uniquely to a map f : ∆n → K.
For 0 ≤ k ≤ n, let Xi ∈ C be the image of the vertex {k} ⊆ Λn
i . For 0 < k ≤ n, let gk : Xk−1 → Xk be the
morphism in C determined by the restriction f0|∆{k−1,k}. The composable chain of morphisms

X0

g2→ . . .

gn→ Xn

determines an n-simplex f : ∆n → K. We will show that f is the desired solution to our extension problem
i = f0, then f ′ must
(the uniqueness of this solution is evident: if f ′ : ∆n → K is any other map with f ′|Λn
correspond to the same chain of morphisms in C, so that f ′ = f ). It will suﬃce to prove the following, for
every 0 ≤ j ≤ n:

(∗j) If j 6= i, then

f |∆{0,...,j−1,j+1,...,n} = f0|∆{0,...,j−1,j+1,...,n}.

To prove (∗j), it will suﬃce to show that f and f0 have the same restriction to ∆{k,k′}, where k and k′
adjacent elements of the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , j − 1, j + 1, . . . , n} ⊆ [n]. If k and k′ are adjacent in
[n], then this follows by construction. In particular, (∗) is automatically satisﬁed if j = 0 or j = n. Suppose
instead that k = j − 1 and k′ = j + 1, where 0 < j < n.
If n = 2, then j = 1 = i and we obtain a
contradiction. We may therefore assume that n > 2, so that either j − 1 > 0 or j + 1 < n. Without loss of
generality, j − 1 > 0, so that ∆{j−1,j+1} ⊆ ∆{1,...,n}. The desired conclusion now follows from (∗0).

We now prove the converse. Suppose that the simplicial set K satisﬁes (2); we claim that K is isomorphic

to the nerve of a small category C. We construct the category C as follows:

(i) The objects of C are the vertices of K.

(ii) Given a pair of objects x, y ∈ C, we let HomC(x, y) denote the collection of all edges e : ∆1 → K such

that e|{0} = x and e|{1} = y.

(iii) Let x be an object of C, Then the identity morphism idx is the edge of K deﬁned by the composition

∆1 → ∆0 e→ K.

(iv) Let f : x → y and g : y → z be morphisms in C. Then f and g together determine a map σ0 : Λ2

1 → K.
In view of condition (2), the map σ0 can be extended uniquely to a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → K. We deﬁne
the composition g ◦ f to be the morphism from x to z in C corresponding to the edge given by the
composition

∆1 ≃ ∆{0,2} ⊆ ∆2 σ→ K.

We ﬁrst claim that C is a category. To prove this, we must verify the following axioms:

(a) For every object y ∈ C, the identity idy is a unit with respect to composition. In other words, for every
morphism f : x → y in C and every morphism g : y → z in C, we have idy ◦f = f and g ◦ idy = g.
These equations are “witnessed” by the 2-simplices s1(f ), s0(g) ∈ HomSet∆(∆2, K).

(b) Composition is associative. That is, for every sequence of composable morphisms

we have h ◦ (g ◦ f ) = (h ◦ g) ◦ f . To prove this, let us ﬁrst choose 2-simplices σ012 and σ123 as indicated
below:

It follows that C is a well-deﬁned category. By construction, we have a canonical map of simplicial sets
φ : K → N C. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that φ is an isomorphism. We will prove,
by induction on n ≥ 0, that φ induces a bijection HomSet∆ (∆n, K) → HomSet∆(∆n, N C). For n = 0 and
n = 1, this is obvious from the construction. Assume therefore that n ≥ 2, and choose an integer i such that
0 < i < n. We have a commutative diagram

HomSet∆ (∆n, K)

HomSet∆(∆n, N C)

HomSet∆(Λn

i , K)

/ HomSet∆(Λn

i , N C).

Since K and N C both satisfy (2) (for N C, this follows from the ﬁrst part of the proof), the vertical maps
are bijective. It will therefore suﬃce to show that the lower horizontal map is bijective, which follows from
the inductive hypothesis.

We note that condition (2) of Proposition 1.1.2.2 is very similar to Deﬁnition 1.1.2.1. However, it is
i with
i → K extend

diﬀerent in two important respects. First, it requires the extension condition only for inner horns Λn
0 < i < n. Second, the asserted condition is stronger in this case: not only does any map Λn
to the simplex ∆n, but the extension is unique.

Remark 1.1.2.3. It is easy to see that it is not reasonable to expect condition (2) of Proposition 1.1.2.2 to
hold for “outer” horns Λn
i , i ∈ {0, n}. Consider, for example, the case where i = n = 2, and where K is the
nerve of a category C. Giving a map Λ2

2 → K corresponds to supplying the solid arrows in the diagram

and the extension condition would amount to the assertion that one could always ﬁnd a dotted arrow
rendering the diagram commutative. This is true in general only when the category C is a groupoid.

We now see that the notion of a simplicial set is a ﬂexible one: a simplicial set K can be a good model
for an ∞-groupoid (if K is a Kan complex), or for an ordinary category (if it satisﬁes the hypotheses of
Proposition 1.1.2.2). Based on these observations, we might expect that some more general class of simplicial
sets could serve as models for ∞-categories in general.

Consider ﬁrst an arbitrary simplicial set K. We can try to envision K as a generalized category, whose
objects are the vertices of K (that is, the elements of K0), and whose morphisms are the edges of K (that
is, the elements of K1). A 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → K should be thought of as a diagram

φ

>~~~~~~~

Y

θ

(cid:31)@@@@@@@

/ Z

together with an identiﬁcation (or homotopy) between θ and ψ◦φ which renders the diagram “commutative”.
(Note that, in higher category theory, this is not merely a condition: the homotopy θ ≃ ψ ◦ φ is an additional
datum.) Simplices of larger dimension may be thought of as verifying the commutativity of certain higher-
dimensional diagrams.

Unfortunately, for a general simplicial set K, the analogy outlined above is not very strong. The essence
of the problem is that, though we may refer to the 1-simplices of K as “morphisms”, there is in general no
way to compose them. Taking our cue from the example of N(C), we might say that a morphism θ : X → Z
is a composition of morphisms φ : X → Y and ψ : Y → Z if there exists a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → K as in the
diagram indicated above. We must now consider two potential diﬃculties: the 2-simplex σ may not exist,
and if it does it exist it may not be unique, so that we have more than one choice for the composition θ.

The existence of σ can be formulated as an extension condition on the simplicial set K. We note that a
1 → K. Thus, the assertion that
1 → K can

composable pair of morphisms (ψ, φ) determines a map of simplicial sets Λ2

The uniqueness of θ is another matter. It turns out to be unnecessary (and unnatural) to require that θ
be uniquely determined. To understand this point, let us return to the example of the fundamental groupoid
of a topological space X. This is a category whose objects are the points x ∈ X. The morphisms between
a point x ∈ X and a point y ∈ X are given by continuous paths p : [0, 1] → X such that p(0) = x and
p(1) = y. Two such paths are considered to be equivalent if there is a homotopy between them. Composition
in the fundamental groupoid is given by concatenation of paths. Given paths p, q : [0, 1] → X with p(0) = x,
p(1) = q(0) = y, and q(1) = z, the composite of p and q should be a path joining x to z. There are many
ways of obtaining such a path from p and q. One of the simplest is to deﬁne

r(t) =

p(2t)
q(2t − 1)

(

if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
2
if 1
2 ≤ t ≤ 1.

However, we could just as well use the formula

r′(t) =

p(3t)
q( 3t−1
2 )

(

if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
3
if 1
3 ≤ t ≤ 1

to deﬁne the composite path. Because the paths r and r′ are homotopic to one another, it does not matter
which one we choose.

The situation becomes more complicated if we try to think 2-categorically. We can capture more infor-
mation about the space X by considering its fundamental 2-groupoid. This is a 2-category whose objects are
the points of X, whose morphisms are paths between points, and whose 2-morphisms are given by homo-
topies between paths (which are themselves considered modulo homotopy). In order to have composition of
morphisms unambiguously deﬁned, we would have to choose some formula once and for all. Moreover, there
is no particularly compelling choice; for example, neither of the formulas written above leads to a strictly
associative composition law.

The lesson to learn from this is that in higher-categorical situations, we should not necessarily ask for
a uniquely determined composition of two morphisms.
In the fundamental groupoid example, there are
many choices for a composite path but all of them are homotopic to one another. Moreover, in keeping
with the philosophy of higher category theory, any path which is homotopic to the composite should be just
as good as the composite itself. From this point of view, it is perhaps more natural to view composition
as a relation than as a function, and this is very eﬃciently encoded in the formalism of simplicial sets: a
2-simplex σ : ∆2 → K should be viewed as “evidence” that d0(σ) ◦ d2(σ) is homotopic to d1(σ).

Exactly what conditions on a simplicial set K will guarantee that it behaves like a higher category?
Based on the above argument, it seems reasonable to require that K satisfy an extension condition with
respect to certain horn inclusions Λn
i , as in Deﬁnition 1.1.2.1. However, as we observed in Remark 1.1.2.3,
this is reasonable only for the inner horns where 0 < i < n, which appear in the statement of Proposition
1.1.2.2.

Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4. An ∞-category is a simplicial set K which has the following property: for any 0 < i < n,
any map f0 : Λn

i → K admits an extension f : ∆n → K.

Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4 was ﬁrst formulated by Boardman and Vogt ([10]). They referred to ∞-catgories as
weak Kan complexes, motivated by the obvious analogy with Deﬁnition 1.1.2.1. Our terminology places more
emphasis on the analogy with the characterization of ordinary categories given in Proposition 1.1.2.2: we
require the same extension conditions, but drop the uniqueness assumption.

Example 1.1.2.5. Any Kan complex is an ∞-category. In particular, if X is a topological space, then
we may view its singular complex Sing X as an ∞-category: this is one way of deﬁning the fundamental
∞-groupoid π≤∞X of X, introduced informally in Example 1.1.1.4.

Example 1.1.2.6. The nerve of any category is an ∞-category. We will occasionally abuse terminology by
identifying a category C with its nerve N(C); by means of this identiﬁcation, we may view ordinary category
theory as a special case of the study of ∞-categories.

The weak Kan condition of Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4 leads to a very elegant and powerful version of higher
category theory. This theory has been developed by Joyal in the papers [43] and [44] (where simplicial sets
satisfying the condition of Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4 are called quasi-categories), and will be used throughout this
book.

Notation 1.1.2.7. Depending on the context, we will use two diﬀerent notations in connection with simpli-
cial sets. When emphasizing their role as ∞-categories, we will often denote them by calligraphic letters such
as C, D, and so forth. When casting simplicial sets in their diﬀerent (though related) role of representing
homotopy types, we will employ capital Roman letters. To avoid confusion, we will also employ the latter
notation when we wish to contrast the theory of ∞-categories with some other other approach to higher
category theory, such as the theory of topological categories.

1.1.3 Equivalences of Topological Categories

We have now introduced two approaches to higher category theory: one based on topological categories,
and one based on simplicial sets. These two approaches turn out to be equivalent to one another. However,
the equivalence itself needs to be understood in a higher-categorical sense. We take our cue from classical
homotopy theory, in which we can take the basic objects to be either topological spaces or simplicial sets.

22

It is not true that every Kan complex is isomorphic to the singular complex of a topological space, or that
every CW complex is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of a simplicial set. However, both of these
statements become true if we replace the words “isomorphic to” by “homotopy equivalent to”. We would like
to formulate a similar statement regarding our approaches to higher category theory. The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd
a concept which replaces “homotopy equivalence”. If F : C → D is a functor between topological categories,
under what circumstances should we regard F as an “equivalence” (so that C and D really represent the
same higher category)?

The most naive answer is that F should be regarded as an equivalence if it is an isomorphism of topological
categories. This means that F induces a bijection between the objects of C and the objects of D, and a
homeomorphism MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(F (X), F (Y )) for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C. However, it is
immediately obvious that this condition is far too strong; for example, in the case where C and D are
ordinary categories (which we may view also as topological categories, where all morphism sets are endowed
with the discrete topology), we recover the notion of an isomorphism between categories. This notion does
not play an important role in category theory. One rarely asks whether or not two categories are isomorphic;
instead, one asks whether or not they are equivalent. This suggests the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 1.1.3.1. A functor F : C → D between topological categories is a strong equivalence if it is an
equivalence in the sense of enriched category theory. In other words, F is a strong equivalence if it induces
homeomorphisms MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(F (X), F (Y )) for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, and every object
of D is isomorphic (in D) to F (X) for some X ∈ C.

The notion of strong equivalence between topological categories has the virtue that, when restricted to
ordinary categories, it reduces to the usual notion of equivalence. However, it is still not the right deﬁnition:
for a pair of objects X and Y of a higher category C, the morphism space MapC(X, Y ) should itself only be
well-deﬁned up to homotopy equivalence.

Deﬁnition 1.1.3.2. Let C be a topological category. The homotopy category hC is deﬁned as follows:

• The objects of hC are the objects of C.

• If X, Y ∈ C, then we deﬁne HomhC(X, Y ) = π0 MapC(X, Y ).

• Composition of morphisms in hC is induced from the composition of morphisms in C by applying the

functor π0.

Example 1.1.3.3. Let C be the topological category whose objects are CW-complexes, where MapC(X, Y )
is the set of continuous maps from X to Y , equipped with the (compactly generated version of the) compact-
open topology. We will denote the homotopy category of C by H, and refer to H as the homotopy category
of spaces.

There is a second construction of the homotopy category H, which will play an important role in what

follows. First, we must recall a bit of terminology from classical homotopy theory.

Deﬁnition 1.1.3.4. A map f : X → Y between topological spaces is said to be a weak homotopy equivalence
if it induces a bijection π0X → π0Y , and if for every point x ∈ X and every i ≥ 1, the induced map of
homotopy groups

πi(X, x) → πi(Y, f (x))

is an isomorphism.

Given a space X ∈ CG, classical homotopy theory ensures the existence of a CW-complex X ′ equipped
with a weak homotopy equivalence φ : X ′ → X. Of course, X ′ is not uniquely determined; however, it is
unique up to canonical homotopy equivalence, so that the assignment

X 7→ [X] = X ′

23

determines a functor θ : CG → H. By construction, θ carries weak homotopy equivalences in CG to isomor-
phisms in H. In fact, θ is universal with respect to this property. In other words, we may describe H as
the category obtained from CG by formally inverting all weak homotopy equivalences. This is one version
of Whitehead’s theorem, which is usually stated as follows: every weak homotopy equivalence between CW
complexes admits a homotopy inverse.

We can now improve upon Deﬁnition 1.1.3.2 slightly. We ﬁrst observe that the functor θ : CG →
H preserves products. Consequently, we can apply the construction of Remark A.1.4.3 to convert any
topological category C into a category enriched over H. We will denote this H-enriched category by hC, and
refer to it as the homotopy category of C. More concretely, the homotopy category hC may be described as
follows:

(1) The objects of hC are the objects of C.

(2) For X, Y ∈ C, we have

MaphC(X, Y ) = [MapC(X, Y )].

(3) The composition law on hC is obtained from the composition law on C by applying the functor θ :

CG → H.

Remark 1.1.3.5. If C is a topological category, we have now deﬁned hC in two diﬀerent ways: ﬁrst as an
ordinary category, and then as a category enriched over H. These two deﬁnitions are compatible with one
another, in the sense that hC (as an ordinary category) is the underlying category of hC (as an H-enriched
category). This follows immediately from the observation that for every topological space X, there is a
canonical bijection π0X ≃ MapH(∗, [X]).

If C is a topological category, we may imagine that hC is the object which is obtained by forgetting
the topological morphism spaces of C and remembering only their (weak) homotopy types. The following
deﬁnition codiﬁes the idea that these homotopy types should be “all that really matter”.

Deﬁnition 1.1.3.6. Let F : C → D be a functor between topological categories. We will say that F is a
weak equivalence, or simply an equivalence, if the induced functor hC → hD is an equivalence of H-enriched
categories.

More concretely, a functor F is an equivalence if and only if:

• For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the induced map

MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(F (X), F (Y ))

is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces.

• Every object of D is isomorphic in hD to F (X), for some X ∈ C.

Remark 1.1.3.7. A morphism f : X → Y in D is said to be an equivalence if the induced morphism in hD
is an isomorphism. In general, this is much weaker than the condition that f be an isomorphism in D; see
Proposition 1.2.4.1.

It is Deﬁnition 1.1.3.6 which gives the correct notion of equivalence between topological categories (at
least, when one is using them to describe higher category theory). We will agree that all relevant properties of
topological categories are invariant under this notion of equivalence. We say that two topological categories
are equivalent if there is an equivalence between them, or more generally if there is a chain of equivalences
joining them. Equivalent topological categories should be regarded as “the same” for all relevant purposes.

24

Remark 1.1.3.8. According to Deﬁnition 1.1.3.6, a functor F : C → D is an equivalence if and only if
the induced functor hC → hD is an equivalence. In other words, the homotopy category hC (regarded as a
category which is enriched over H) is an invariant of C which is suﬃciently powerful to detect equivalences
between ∞-categories. This should be regarded as analogous to the more classical fact that the homotopy
groups πi(X, x) of a CW complex X are homotopy invariants which detect homotopy equivalences between
CW complexes (by Whitehead’s theorem). However, it is important to remember that hC does not determine
C up to equivalence, just as the homotopy type of a CW complex is not determined by its homotopy groups.

1.1.4 Simplicial Categories

In the previous sections we introduced two very diﬀerent approaches to the foundations of higher category
theory: one based on topological categories, the other on simplicial sets. In order to prove that they are
equivalent to one another, we will introduce a third approach, which is closely related to the ﬁrst but shares
the combinatorial ﬂavor of the second.

Deﬁnition 1.1.4.1. A simplicial category is a category which is enriched over the category Set∆ of simplicial
sets. The category of simplicial categories (where morphisms are given by simplicially enriched functors)
will be denoted by Cat∆.

Remark 1.1.4.2. Every simplicial category can be regarded as a simplicial object in the category Cat.
Conversely, a simplicial object of Cat arises from a simplicial category if and only if the underlying simplicial
set of objects is constant.

Like topological categories, simplicial categories can be used as models of higher category theory. If C is a
simplicial category, then we will generally think of the simplicial sets MapC(X, Y ) as “spaces”, or homotopy
types.

Remark 1.1.4.3. If C is a simplicial category with the property that each of the simplicial sets MapC(X, Y )
is an ∞-category, then we may view C itself as a kind of ∞-bicategory. We will not use this interpretation
of simplicial categories in this book. Usually we will consider only ﬁbrant simplicial categories: that is,
simplicial categories for which the mapping objects MapC(X, Y ) are Kan complexes.

The relationship between simplicial categories and topological categories is easy to describe. Let Set∆
denote the category of simplicial sets and CG the category of compactly generated Hausdorﬀ spaces. We
recall that there exists a pair of adjoint functors

Set∆

||

Sing

/ CG

which are called the geometric realization and singular complex functors, respectively. Both of these functors
commute with ﬁnite products. Consequently, if C is a simplicial category, we may deﬁne a topological
category | C | in the following way:

• The objects of | C | are the objects of C.

• If X, Y ∈ C, then Map| C |(X, Y ) = | MapC(X, Y )|.

• The composition law for morphisms in | C | is obtained from the composition law on C by applying the

geometric realization functor.

Similarly, if C is a topological category, we may obtain a simplicial category Sing C by applying the
singular complex functor to each of the morphism spaces individually. The singular complex and geometric
realization functors determine an adjunction between Cat∆ and Cattop. This adjunction should be understood
as determining an “equivalence” between the theory of simplicial categories and the theory of topological

25

/
o
o
categories. This is essentially a formal consequence of the fact that the geometric realization and singular
complex functors determine an equivalence between the homotopy theory of topological spaces and the
homotopy theory of simplicial sets. More precisely, we recall that a map f : S → T of simplicial sets is said
to be a weak homotopy equivalence if the induced map |S| → |T | of topological spaces is a weak homotopy
equivalence. A theorem of Quillen (see [32] for a proof) asserts that the unit and counit morphisms

S → Sing |S|

| Sing X| → X

are weak homotopy equivalences, for every (compactly generated) topological space X and every simplicial
set S. It follows that the category obtained from CG by inverting weak homotopy equivalences (of spaces) is
equivalent to the category obtained from Set∆ by inverting weak homotopy equivalences. We use the symbol
H to denote either of these (equivalent) categories.

If C is a simplicial category, we let hC denote the H-enriched category obtained by applying the functor
Set∆ → H to each of the morphism spaces of C. We will refer to hC as the homotopy category of C. We
note that this is the same notation that was introduced in §1.1.3 for the homotopy category of a topological
category. However, there is little risk of confusion: the above remarks imply the existence of canonical
isomorphisms

hC ≃ h| C |

hD ≃ hSing D

for every simplicial category C and every topological category D.

Deﬁnition 1.1.4.4. A functor C → C′ between simplicial categories is an equivalence if the induced functor
hC → hC′ is an equivalence of H-enriched categories.

In other words, a functor C → C′ between simplicial categories is an equivalence if and only if the
geometric realization | C | → | C′ | is an equivalence of topological categories. In fact, one can say more. It
follows easily from the preceding remarks that the unit and counit maps

C → Sing | C |

| Sing D | → D

induce isomorphisms between homotopy categories. Consequently, if we are working with topological or
simplicial categories up to equivalence, we are always free to replace a simplicial category C by | C |, or
a topological category D by Sing D. In this sense, the notions of topological and simplicial category are
equivalent and either can be used as a foundation for higher category theory.

1.1.5 Comparing ∞-Categories with Simplicial Categories

In §1.1.4, we introduced the theory of simplicial categories and explained why (for our purposes) it is
equivalent to the theory of topological categories. In this section, we will show that the theory of simplicial
categories is also closely related to the theory of ∞-categories. Our discussion requires somewhat more
elaborate constructions than were needed in the previous sections; a reader who does not wish to become
bogged down in details is urged to skip ahead to §1.2.1.

We will relate simplicial categories with simplicial sets by means of the simplicial nerve functor

N : Cat∆ → Set∆,

originally introduced by Cordier (see [16]). The nerve of an ordinary category C is characterized by the
formula

HomSet∆(∆n, N(C)) = HomCat([n], C);

26

here [n] denotes the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , n}, regarded as a category. This deﬁnition makes sense also
when C is a simplicial category, but is clearly not very interesting: it makes no use of the simplicial structure
on C. In order to obtain a more interesting construction, we need to replace the ordinary category [n] by a
suitable “thickening”, a simplicial category which we will denote by C[∆n].

Deﬁnition 1.1.5.1. Let J be a ﬁnite nonempty linearly ordered set. The simplicial category C[∆J ] is
deﬁned as follows:

• The objects of C[∆J ] are the elements of J.

• If i, j ∈ J, then

MapC[∆J ](i, j) =

∅
N(Pi,j )

(

if j < i
if i ≤ j.

Here Pi,j denotes the partially ordered set {I ⊆ J : (i, j ∈ I) ∧ (∀k ∈ I)[i ≤ k ≤ j])}.

• If i0 ≤ i1 ≤ . . . ≤ in, then the composition

MapC[∆J ](i0, i1) × . . . × MapC[∆J ](in−1, in) → MapC[∆J ](i0, in)

is induced by the map of partially ordered sets

Pi0,i1 × . . . × Pin−1,in → Pi0,in

(I1, . . . , In) 7→ I1 ∪ . . . ∪ In.

In order to help digest Deﬁnition 1.1.5.1, let us analyze the structure of the topological category | C[∆n]|.
The objects of this category are elements of the set [n] = {0, . . . , n}. For each 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, the
topological space Map| C[∆n]|(i, j) is homeomorphic to a cube; it may be identiﬁed with the set of all functions
p : {k ∈ [n] : i ≤ k ≤ j} → [0, 1] which satisfy p(i) = p(j) = 1. The morphism space Map| C[∆n]|(i, j) is
empty when j < i, and composition of morphisms is given by concatenation of functions.

Remark 1.1.5.2. Let us try to understand better the simplicial category C[∆n] and its relationship to the
ordinary category [n]. These categories have the same objects, namely the elements of {0, . . . , n}. In the
category [n], there is a unique morphism qij : i → j whenever i ≤ j. In virtue of the uniqueness, these
elements satisfy qjk ◦ qij = qik for i ≤ j ≤ k.

In the simplicial category C[∆n], there is a vertex pij ∈ MapC[∆n](i, j), given by the element {i, j} ∈ Pij .
We note that pjk ◦ pij 6= pik (unless we are in one of the degenerate cases where i = j or j = k). Instead,
the collection of all compositions

pinin−1 ◦ pin−1in−2 ◦ . . . ◦ pi1i0 ,

where i = i0 < i1 < . . . < in−1 < in = j constitute all of the diﬀerent vertices of the cube MapC[∆n](i, j). The
weak contractibility of MapC[∆n](i, j) expresses the idea that although these compositions do not coincide,
they are all canonically homotopic to one another. We observe that there is a (unique) functor C[∆n] → [n]
which is the identity on objects, and that this functor is an equivalence of simplicial categories. We can
summarize the situation informally as follows: the simplicial category C[∆n] is a “thickened version” of [n],
where we have dropped the strict associativity condition

qjk ◦ qij = qik

and instead have imposed associativity only up to (coherent) homotopy. (We can formulate this idea more
precisely by saying that C[∆•] is a coﬁbrant replacement for [•] with respect to a suitable model structure
on the category of cosimplicial objects of Cat∆.)

The construction J 7→ C[∆J ] is functorial in J, as we now explain.

27

Deﬁnition 1.1.5.3. Let f : J → J ′ be a monotone map between linearly ordered sets. The simplicial
functor C[f ] : C[∆J ] → C[∆J ′

] is deﬁned as follows:

• For each object i ∈ C[∆J ], C[f ](i) = f (i) ∈ C[∆J ′

].

• If i ≤ j in J, then the map MapC[∆J ](i, j) → MapC[∆J′ ](f (i), f (j)) induced by f is the nerve of the

map

Pi,j → Pf (i),f (j)

I 7→ f (I).

Remark 1.1.5.4. Using the notation of Remark 1.1.5.2, we note that Deﬁnition 1.1.5.3 has been rigged so
that the functor C[f ] carries the vertex pij ∈ MapC[∆J ](i, j) to the vertex pf (i)f (j) ∈ MapC[∆J′ ](f (i), f (j)).

It is not diﬃcult to check that the construction described in Deﬁnition 1.1.5.3 is well-deﬁned, and com-

patible with composition in f . Consequently, we deduce that C determines a functor

∆ → Cat∆

∆n 7→ C[∆n],

which we may view as a cosimplicial object of Cat∆.

Deﬁnition 1.1.5.5. Let C be a simplicial category. The simplicial nerve N(C) is the simplicial set described
by the formula

HomSet∆ (∆n, N(C)) = HomCat∆ (C[∆n], C).

If C is a topological category, we deﬁne the topological nerve N(C) of C to be the simplicial nerve of Sing C.

Remark 1.1.5.6. If C is a simplicial (topological) category, we will often abuse terminology by referring to
the simplicial (topological) nerve of C simply as the nerve of C.

Warning 1.1.5.7. Let C be a simplicial category. Then C can be regarded as an ordinary category, by
ignoring all simplices of positive dimension in the mapping spaces of C. The simplicial nerve of C does not
coincide with the nerve of this underlying ordinary category. Our notation is therefore potentially ambiguous.
We will adopt the following convention: whenever C is a simplicial category, N(C) will denote the simplicial
nerve of C, unless we specify otherwise. Similarly, if C is a topological category, then the topological nerve
of C does not generally coincide with the nerve of the underlying category; the notation N(C) will be used
to indicate the topological nerve, unless otherwise speciﬁed.

Example 1.1.5.8. Any ordinary category C may be considered as a simplicial category, by taking each of
the simplicial sets HomC(X, Y ) to be constant. In this case, the set of simplicial functors C[∆n] → C may
be identiﬁed with the set of functors from [n] into C. Consequently, the simplicial nerve of C agrees with
the ordinary nerve of C, as deﬁned in §1.1.2. Similarly, the ordinary nerve of C can be identiﬁed with the
topological nerve of C, where C is regarded as a topological category with discrete morphism spaces.

In order to get a feel for what the nerve of a topological category C looks like, let us explicitly describe

its low-dimensional simplices:

• The 0-simplices of N(C) may be identiﬁed with the objects of C.

• The 1-simplices of N(C) may be identiﬁed with the morphisms of C.

commutative)

/ Z.

To give a 2-simplex of N(C) having this speciﬁed boundary is equivalent to giving a path from fXZ to
fY Z ◦ fXY in MapC(X, Z).

The category Cat∆ of simplicial categories admits (small) colimits. Consequently, by formal nonsense,
the functor C : ∆ → Cat∆ extends uniquely (up to unique isomorphism) to a colimit-preserving functor
Set∆ → Cat∆, which we will denote also by C. By construction, the functor C is left adjoint to the simplicial
nerve functor N. For each simplicial set S, we can view C[S] as the simplicial category “freely generated” by
S: every n-simplex σ : ∆n → S determines a functor C[∆n] → C[S], which we can think of as a homotopy
coherent diagram [n] → C[S].

Example 1.1.5.9. Let A be a partially ordered set. The simplicial category C[N A] can be constructed
using the following generalization of Deﬁnition 1.1.5.1:

• The objects of C[N A] are the elements of A.

• Given a pair of elements a, b ∈ A, the simplicial set MapC[N A](a, b) can be identiﬁed with N Pa,b, where
Pa,b denotes the collection of linearly ordered subsets S ⊆ A with least element a and largest element
b, partially ordered by inclusion.

• Given a sequence of elements a0, . . . , an ∈ A, the composition map

MapC[N A](a0, a1) × . . . × MapC[N A](an−1, an) → MapC[N A](a0, an)

is induced by the map of partially ordered sets

Pa0,a1 × . . . × Pan−1,an → Pa0,an

(S1, . . . , Sn) 7→ S1 ∪ . . . ∪ Sn.

Proposition 1.1.5.10. Let C be a simplicial category having the property that, for every pair of objects
X, Y ∈ C, the simplicial set MapC(X, Y ) is a Kan complex. Then the simplicial nerve N(C) is an ∞-
category.

Proof. We must show that if 0 < i < n, then N(C) has the right extension property with respect to the
i ⊆ ∆n. Rephrasing this in the language of simplicial categories, we must show that C has the
inclusion Λn
right extension property with respect to the simplicial functor C[Λn
i ] → C[∆n]. To prove this, we make use
of the following observations concerning C[Λn

i ], which we view as a simplicial subcategory of C[∆n]:

• The objects of C[Λn

i ] are the objects of C[∆n]: that is, elements of the set [n].

• For 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n, the simplicial set MapC[Λn

i ](j, k) coincides with MapC[∆n](j, k) unless j = 0 and

k = n (note that this condition fails if i = 0 or i = n).

MapC[∆n](0, n)

Since the simplicial set on the right is a Kan complex by assumption, it suﬃces to verify that the left vertical
map is anodyne. This follows by inspection: the simplicial set MapC[∆n](0, n) can be identiﬁed with the
cube (∆1){1,...,n−1}, and MapC[Λn
i ](0, n) can be identiﬁed with the simplicial subset obtained by removing
the interior of the cube together with one of its faces.

Remark 1.1.5.11. The proof of Proposition 1.1.5.10 yields a slightly stronger result:
functor between simplicial categories which induces Kan ﬁbrations MapC(C, C′) → MapD(F (C), F (C′)) for
every pair of objects C, C′ ∈ C, then the associated map N(C) → N(D) is an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets
(see Deﬁnition 2.0.0.3).

Corollary 1.1.5.12. Let C be a topological category. Then the topological nerve N(C) is an ∞-category.

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 1.1.5.10, since the singular complex of any topological
space is a Kan complex.

We now cite the following theorem, which will be proven in §2.2.4 and reﬁned in §2.2.5:

Theorem 1.1.5.13. Let C be a topological category, and let X, Y ∈ C be objects. Then the counit map

is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces.

| MapC[N(C)](X, Y )| → MapC(X, Y )

Assuming Theorem 1.1.5.13, we can now explain why the theory of ∞-categories is equivalent to the
theory of topological categories (or, equivalently, simplicial categories). The adjoint functors N and | C[•]|
are not mutually inverse equivalences of categories. However, they are homotopy inverse to one another. To
make this precise, we need to introduce a deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.1.5.14. Let S be a simplicial set. The homotopy category hS is deﬁned to be the homotopy
category hC[S ] of the simplicial category C[S]. We will often view hS as a category enriched over the
homotopy category H of spaces via the construction of §1.1.4: that is, for every pair of vertices x, y ∈ S, we
have MaphS (x, y) = [MapC[S](x, y)]. A map f : S → T of simplicial sets is a categorical equivalence if the
induced map hS → hT is an equivalence of H-enriched categories.

Remark 1.1.5.15. In [44], Joyal uses the term “weak categorical equivalence” for what we have called a
“categorical equivalence”, and reserves the term “categorical equivalence” for a stronger notion of equivalence.

Remark 1.1.5.16. We have introduced the term “categorical equivalence”, rather than simply “equivalence”
or “weak equivalence”, in order to avoid confusing the notion of categorical equivalence of simplicial sets
with the (more classical) notion of weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

Remark 1.1.5.17. It is immediate from the deﬁnition that f : S → T is a categorical equivalence if and
only if C[S] → C[T ] is an equivalence (of simplicial categories), if and only if | C[S]| → | C[T ]| is an equivalence
(of topological categories).

We now observe that the adjoint functors (| C[•]|, N) determine an equivalence between the theory of
simplicial sets (up to categorical equivalence) and that of topological categories (up to equivalence).
In
other words, for any topological category C the counit map | C[N(C)]| → C is an equivalence of topological
categories, and for any simplicial set S the unit map S → N | C[S]| is a categorical equivalence of simplicial
sets. In view of Remark 1.1.5.17, the second assertion is a formal consequence of the ﬁrst. Moreover, the
ﬁrst assertion is merely a reformulation of Theorem 1.1.5.13.

Remark 1.1.5.18. The reader may at this point object that we have achieved a comparison between the
theory of topological categories with the theory of simplicial sets, but that not every simplicial set is an
∞-category. However, every simplicial set is categorically equivalent to an ∞-category. In fact, Theorem
1.1.5.13 implies that every simplicial set S is categorically equivalent to the nerve of the topological category
| C[S]|, which is an ∞-category (Corollary 1.1.5.12).

1.2 The Language of Higher Category Theory

One of the main goals of this book is to demonstrate that many ideas from classical category theory can be
adapted to the setting of higher categories. In this section, we will survey some of the simplest examples.

1.2.1 The Opposite of an ∞-Category
If C is an ordinary category, then the opposite category Cop is deﬁned in the following way:

• The objects of Cop are the objects of C.

• For X, Y ∈ C, we have HomCop(X, Y ) = HomC(Y, X). Identity morphisms and composition are deﬁned

in the obvious way.

This deﬁnition generalizes without change to the setting of topological or simplicial categories. Adapting
this deﬁnition to the setting of ∞-categories requires a few additional words. We may deﬁne more generally
the opposite of a simplicial set S as follows: For any ﬁnite, nonempty, linearly ordered set J, we set Sop(J) =
S(J op), where J op denotes the same set J endowed with the opposite ordering. More concretely, we have
n = Sn, but the face and degeneracy maps on Sop are given by the formulas
Sop

(di : Sop

n → Sop

n−1) = (dn−i : Sn → Sn−1)

(si : Sop

n → Sop

n+1) = (sn−i : Sn → Sn+1).

The formation of opposite categories is fully compatible with all of the constructions we have introduced

for passing back and forth between diﬀerent models of higher category theory.

It is clear from the deﬁnition that a simplicial set S is an ∞-category if and only if its opposite Sop is an
i ⊆ ∆n if and

∞-category: for 0 < i < n, S has the extension property with respect to the horn inclusion Λn
only if Sop has the extension property with respect to the horn inclusion Λn

n−i ⊆ ∆n.

The construction S 7→ Sop determines an automorphism of the ∞-category of ∞-categories. We will

later see that this is (essentially) the only nontrivial automorphism (see Theorem 5.2.9.1).

1.2.2 Mapping Spaces in Higher Category Theory

If X and Y are objects of an ordinary category C, then one has a well-deﬁned set HomC(X, Y ) of morphisms
from X to Y . In higher category theory, one has instead a morphism space MapC(X, Y ). In the setting of
topological or simplicial categories, this morphism space (either a topological space or a simplicial set) is
an inherent feature of the formalism. In the setting of ∞-categories, it is not so obvious how MapC(X, Y )
should be deﬁned. However, it is at least clear what to do on the level of the homotopy category.

Deﬁnition 1.2.2.1. Let S be a simplicial set containing vertices x and y, and let H denote the homotopy
category of spaces. We deﬁne MapS(x, y) = MaphS (x, y) ∈ H to be the object of H representing the space
of maps from x to y in S. Here hS denotes the homotopy category of S, regarded as a H-enriched category
(Deﬁnition 1.1.5.14).

Warning 1.2.2.2. Let S be a simplicial set. The notation MapS(X, Y ) has two very diﬀerent meanings.
When X and Y are vertices of S, then our notation should be interpreted in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.2.2.1,
so that MapS(X, Y ) is an object of H. If X and Y are objects of (Set∆)/S, then we instead let MapS(X, Y )
denote the simplicial mapping object

Y X ×SX {φ} ∈ Set∆,

where φ denotes the structural morphism X → S. We trust that it will be clear in context which of these
two deﬁnitions applies in a given situation.

32

We now consider the following question: given a simplicial set S containing a pair of vertices x and y, how
can we compute MapS(x, y)? We have deﬁned MapS(x, y) as an object of the homotopy category H, but for
many purposes it is important to choose a simplicial set M which represents MapS(x, y). The most obvious
candidate for M is the simplicial set MapC[S](x, y). The advantages of this deﬁnition are that it works in all
cases (that is, S does not need to be an ∞-category), and comes equipped with an associative composition law.
However, the construction of the simplicial set MapC[S](x, y) is quite complicated. Furthermore, MapC[S](x, y)
is usually not a Kan complex, so it can be diﬃcult to extract algebraic invariants like homotopy groups, even
when a concrete description of its simplices is known.

In order to address these shortcomings, we will introduce another simplicial set which represents the
homotopy type MapS(x, y) ∈ H, at least when S is an ∞-category. We deﬁne a new simplicial set HomR
S (x, y),
the space of right morphisms from x to y, by letting HomSet∆ (∆n, HomR
S (x, y)) denote the set of all z :
∆n+1 → S such that z|∆{n+1} = y and z|∆{0,...,n} is a constant simplex at the vertex x. The face and
degeneracy operations on HomR

S (x, y)n are deﬁned to coincide with corresponding operations on Sn+1.

We ﬁrst observe that when S is an ∞-category, HomR

S (x, y) really is a “space”:

Proposition 1.2.2.3. Let C be an ∞-category containing a pair of objects x and y. The simplicial set
HomR

C (x, y) is a Kan complex.

Proof. It is immediate from the deﬁnition that if C is a ∞-category, then M = HomR
extension condition for every horn inclusion Λn
complex (Proposition 1.2.5.1).

C (x, y) satisﬁes the Kan
i ⊆ ∆n where 0 < i ≤ n. This implies that M is a Kan

Remark 1.2.2.4. If S is a simplicial set and x, y, z ∈ S0, then there is no obvious composition law

HomR

S (x, y) × HomR

S (y, z) → HomR

S (x, z).

We will later see that if S is an ∞-category, then there is a composition law which is well-deﬁned up to a
contractible space of choices. The absence of a canonical choice for a composition law is the main drawback of
HomR
S (x, y), in comparison with MapC[S](x, y). The main goal of §2.2 is to show that, if S is an ∞-category,
then there is a (canonical) isomorphism between HomR
S (x, y) and MapC[S](x, y) in the homotopy category
H. In particular, we will conclude that HomR

S (x, y) represents MapS(x, y), whenever S is an ∞-category.

Remark 1.2.2.5. The deﬁnition of HomR
general. Instead we deﬁne HomL
that z|∆{0} = x and z|∆{1,...,n+1} is the constant simplex at the vertex y.

Sop(y, x)op, so that HomL

S (x, y) is not self-dual: that is, HomR

S(x, y) = HomR

Sop(x, y) 6= HomR
S (y, x) in
S(x, y)n is the set of all z ∈ Sn+1 such

Although the simplicial sets HomL

S (x, y) are generally not isomorphic to one another,
they are homotopy equivalent whenever S is an ∞-category. To prove this, it is convenient to deﬁne a third,
self-dual, space of morphisms: let HomS(x, y) = {x} ×S S∆1
×S {y}. In other words, to give an n-simplex of
HomS(x, y), one must give a map f : ∆n × ∆1 → S, such that f |∆n × {0} is constant at x and f |∆n × {1}
is constant at y. We observe that there exist natural inclusions

S(x, y) and HomR

HomR

S (x, y) ֒→ HomS(x, y) ←֓ HomL

S(x, y),

which are induced by retracting the cylinder ∆n × ∆1 onto certain maximal dimensional simplices. We
will later show (Corollary 4.2.1.8) that these inclusions are homotopy equivalences, provided that S is an
∞-category.

1.2.3 The Homotopy Category

For every ordinary category C, the nerve N(C) is an ∞-category. Informally, we can describe the situation as
follows: the nerve functor is a fully faithful inclusion from the bicategory of categories to the ∞-bicategory
of ∞-categories. Moreover, this inclusion has a left adjoint:

33

Proposition 1.2.3.1. The nerve functor Cat → Set∆ is right adjoint to the functor h: Set∆ → Cat, which
associates to every simplicial set S its homotopy category hS (here we ignore the H-enrichment of hS ).

Proof. Let us temporarily distinguish between the nerve functor N : Cat → Set∆ and the simplicial nerve
functor N′ : Cat∆ → Set∆. These two functors are related by the fact that N can be written as a composition

The functor π0 : Set∆ → Set is a left adjoint to the inclusion functor Set → Set∆, so the functor

Cat

i
⊆ Cat∆

N′
→ Set∆ .

Cat∆ → Cat

C 7→ hC

is left adjoint to i. It follows that N = N′ ◦i has a left adjoint, given by the composition

Set∆

C[•]
→ Cat∆

h→ Cat,

which coincides with the homotopy category functor h : Set∆ → Cat by deﬁnition.

Remark 1.2.3.2. The formation of the homotopy category is literally left adjoint to the inclusion Cat ⊆
Cat∆. The analogous assertion is not quite true in the setting of topological categories, since the functor
π0 : CG → Set is a left adjoint only when restricted to locally path connected spaces.

Warning 1.2.3.3. If C is a simplicial category, then we do not necessarily expect that hC ≃ hN(C). However,
this is always the case when C is ﬁbrant, in the sense that every simplicial set MapC(X, Y ) is a Kan complex.

Remark 1.2.3.4. If S is a simplicial set, Joyal ([44]) refers to the category hS as the fundamental category
of S. This is motivated by the observation that if S is a Kan complex, then hS is the fundamental groupoid
of S in the usual sense.

Our objective, for the remainder of this section, is to obtain a more explicit understanding of the homotopy
category hS of a simplicial set S. Proposition 1.2.3.1 implies that hS admits the following presentation by
generators and relations:

• The objects of hS are the vertices of S.

• For every edge φ : ∆1 → S, there is a morphism φ from φ(0) to φ(1).

• For each σ : ∆2 → S, we have d0(σ) ◦ d2(σ) = d1(σ).

• For each vertex x of S, the morphism s0x is the identity idx.

If S is an ∞-category, there is a much more satisfying construction of the category hS . We will describe
this construction in detail, since it nicely illustrates the utility of the weak Kan condition of Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4.
Let C be an ∞-category. We will construct a category π(C) (which we will eventually show to be equivalent
to the homotopy category hC). The objects of π(C) are the vertices of C. Given an edge φ : ∆1 → C, we
shall say that φ has source C = φ(0) and target C′ = φ(1), and write φ : C → C′. For each object C of C,
we let idC denote the degenerate edge s0(C) : C → C.

Let φ : C → C′ and φ′ : C → C′ be a pair of edges of C having the same source and target. We will say

that φ and φ′ are homotopic if there is a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → C, which we depict as follows:

In this case, we say that σ is a homotopy between φ and φ′.

Proposition 1.2.3.5. Let C be an ∞-category, and let C and C′ be objects of π(C). Then the relation of
homotopy is an equivalence relation on the edges joining C to C′.

Proof. Let φ : ∆1 → C be an edge. Then s1(φ) is a homotopy from φ to itself. Thus homotopy is a reﬂexive
relation.

Suppose next that φ, φ′, φ′′ : C → C′ are edges with the same source and target. Let σ be a homotopy
from φ to φ′ and σ′ a homotopy from φ to φ′′. Let σ′′ : ∆2 → C denote the constant map at the vertex C′.
We have a commutative diagram

∆3.

Since C is an ∞-category, there exists a 3-simplex τ : ∆3 → C as indicated by the dotted arrow in the
diagram. It is easy to see that d1(τ ) is a homotopy from φ′ to φ′′.

As a special case, we may take φ = φ′′; we then deduce that the relation of homotopy is symmetric. It

then follows immediately from the above that the relation of homotopy is also transitive.

Remark 1.2.3.6. The deﬁnition of homotopy that we have given is not evidently self-dual; in other words,
it is not immediately obvious a homotopic pair of edges φ, φ′ : C → C′ of an ∞-category C remain homotopic
when regarded as edges in the opposite ∞-category Cop. To prove this, let σ be a homotopy from φ to φ′,
and consider the commutative diagram

/ C

Λ3
2(cid:127)

∆3.

The assumption that C is an ∞-category guarantees a 3-simplex τ rendering the diagram commutative. The
face d2τ may be regarded as a homotopy from φ′ to φ in Cop.

We can now deﬁne the morphism sets of the category π(C): given vertices X and Y of C, we let
Homπ(C)(X, Y ) denote the set of homotopy classes of edges φ : X → Y in C. For each edge φ : ∆1 → C, we
let [φ] denote the corresponding morphism in π(C).

We deﬁne a composition law on π(C) as follows. Suppose that X, Y , and Z are vertices of C, and that
1 → C. Since C is an

we are given edges φ : X → Y , ψ : Y → Z. The pair (φ, ψ) determines a map Λ2
∞-category, this map extends to a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → C. We now deﬁne [ψ] ◦ [φ] = [d1σ].

Proposition 1.2.3.7. Let C be an ∞-category. The composition law on π(C) is well-deﬁned. In other words,
the homotopy class [ψ] ◦ [φ] does not depend on the choice of ψ representing [ψ], the choice of φ representing
[φ], or the choice of the the 2-simplex σ.

Proof. We begin by verifying the independence of the choice of σ. Suppose that we are given two 2-simplices
σ, σ′ : ∆2 → C, satisfying

Since C is an ∞-category, there exists a 3-simplex τ as indicated by the dotted arrow. It follows that d1τ is
a homotopy from d1σ to d1σ′.

We now show that [ψ] ◦ [φ] depends only on ψ and φ only up to homotopy. In view of Remark 1.2.3.6, the
assertion is symmetric with respect to ψ and φ; it will therefore suﬃce to show that [ψ] ◦ [φ] does not change
if we replace φ by a morphism φ′ which is homotopic to φ. Let σ be a 2-simplex with d0σ = ψ, d2σ = φ,
and let σ′ be a homotopy from φ to φ′. Consider the diagram

Again, the hypothesis that C is an ∞-category guarantees the existence of a 3-simplex τ as indicated in the
diagram. Let σ′′ = d1τ . Then [ψ] ◦ [φ′] = [d1σ′]. But d1σ = d1σ′ by construction, so that [ψ] ◦ [φ] = [ψ] ◦ [φ′]
as desired.

Proposition 1.2.3.8. If C is an ∞-category, then π(C) is a category.

Proof. Let C be a vertex of C. We ﬁrst verify that [idC ] is an identity with respect to the composition law
on π(C). For every edge φ : C′ → C in C, the 2-simplex s1(φ) veriﬁes the equation

This proves that idC is a left identity; the dual argument (Remark 1.2.3.6) shows that [idC] is a right identity.
The only other thing we need to check is the associative law for composition in π(C). Suppose given a

Since C is an ∞-category, there exists a 3-simplex τ rendering the diagram commutative. Then d2(τ ) veriﬁes
the equation [ψ′] ◦ [φ] = [θ], so that

([φ′′] ◦ [φ′]) ◦ [φ] = [θ] = [φ′′] ◦ [ψ] = [φ′′] ◦ ([φ′] ◦ [φ])

as desired.

We now show that if C is an ∞-category, then π(C) is naturally equivalent (in fact isomorphic) to hC.

Proposition 1.2.3.9. Let C be an ∞-category. There exists a unique functor F : hC → π(C) with the
following properties:

(1) On objects, F is the identity map.

(2) For every edge φ of C, F (φ) = [φ].

Moreover, F is an isomorphism of categories.

Proof. The existence and uniqueness of F follows immediately from our presentation of hC by generators
and relations. It is obvious that F is bijective on objects and surjective on morphisms. To complete the
proof, it will suﬃce to show that F is faithful.

We ﬁrst show that every morphism f : x → y in hC may be written as φ for some φ ∈ C. Since the
morphisms in hC are generated by morphisms having the form φ under composition, it suﬃces to show
that the set of such morphisms contains all identity morphisms and is stable under composition. The ﬁrst
assertion is clear, since s0x = idx. For the second, we note that if φ : x → y and φ′ : y → z are composable
edges, then there exists a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → C, which we may depict as follows:

φ

 @@@@@@@@

/ z.

Thus φ′ ◦ φ = ψ.

Now suppose that φ, φ′ : x → y are such that [φ] = [φ′]; we wish to show that φ = φ′. By deﬁnition,

there exists a homotopy σ : ∆2 → C joining φ and φ′. The existence of σ entails the relation

idy ◦φ = φ′

in the homotopy category hS , so that φ = φ′ as desired.

1.2.4 Objects, Morphisms and Equivalences

As in ordinary category theory, we may speak of objects and morphisms in a higher category C. If C is a
topological (or simplicial) category, these should be understood literally as the objects and morphisms in
the underlying category of C. We may also apply this terminology to ∞-categories (or even more general
simplicial sets): if S is a simplicial set, then the objects of S are the vertices ∆0 → S, and the morphisms of
S are edges ∆1 → S. A morphism φ : ∆1 → S is said to have source X = φ(0) and target Y = φ(1); we will
often denote this by writing φ : X → Y . If X : ∆0 → S is an object of S, we will write idX = s0(X) : X → X
and refer to this as the identity morphism of X.

If f, g : X → Y are two morphisms in a higher category C, then f and g are homotopic if they determine
the same morphism in the homotopy category hC. In the setting of ∞-categories, this coincides with the
notion of homotopy introduced in the previous section. In the setting of topological categories, this simply
means that f and g lie in the same path component of MapC(X, Y ).
In either case, we will sometimes
indicate this relationship between f and g by writing f ≃ g.

A morphism f : X → Y in an ∞-category C is said to be an equivalence if it determines an isomorphism
in the homotopy category hC. We say that X and Y are equivalent if there is an equivalence between them
(in other words, if they are isomorphic as objects of hC).

If C is a topological category, then the requirement that a morphism f : X → Y be an equivalence is

quite a bit weaker than the requirement that f be an isomorphism. In fact, we have the following:

Proposition 1.2.4.1. Let f : X → Y be a morphism in a topological category. The following conditions
are equivalent:

(1) The morphism f is an equivalence.

(2) The morphism f has a homotopy inverse g : Y → X; that is, a morphism g such that f ◦ g ≃ idY and

g ◦ f ≃ idX .

(3) For every object Z ∈ C, the induced map MapC(Z, X) → MapC(Z, Y ) is a homotopy equivalence.

(4) For every object Z ∈ C, the induced map MapC(Z, X) → MapC(Z, Y ) is a weak homotopy equivalence.

(5) For every object Z ∈ C, the induced map MapC(Y, Z) → MapC(X, Z) is a homotopy equivalence.

(6) For every object Z ∈ C, the induced map MapC(Y, Z) → MapC(X, Z) is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Proof. It is clear that (2) is merely a reformulation of (1). We will show that (2) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (4) ⇒ (1); the
implications (2) ⇒ (5) ⇒ (6) ⇒ (1) follow using the same argument.

To see that (2) implies (3), we note that if g is a homotopy inverse to f , then composition with g gives
a map MapC(Z, Y ) → MapC(Z, X) which is homotopy inverse to composition with f . It is clear that (3)
implies (4). Finally, if (4) holds, then we note that X and Y represent the same functor on hC so that f
induces an isomorphism between X and Y in hC.

Example 1.2.4.2. Let C be the category of CW-complexes, considered as a topological category by endowing
each of the sets HomC(X, Y ) with the (compactly generated) compact open topology. A pair of objects
X, Y ∈ C are equivalent (in the sense deﬁned above) if and only if they are homotopy equivalent (in the
sense of classical topology).

If C is an ∞-category (topological category, simplicial category), then we shall write X ∈ C to mean that
X is an object of C. We will generally understand that all meaningful properties of objects are invariant
under equivalence. Similarly, all meaningful properties of morphisms are invariant under homotopy and
under composition with equivalences.

In the setting of ∞-categories, there is a very useful characterization of equivalences which is due to

Joyal.

Proposition 1.2.4.3 (Joyal [44]). Let C be an ∞-category, and φ : ∆1 → C a morphism of C. Then φ is an
0 → C such that f0|∆{0,1} = φ, there exists
equivalence if and only if, for every n ≥ 2 and every map f0 : Λn
an extension of f0 to ∆n.

The proof requires some ideas which we have not yet introduced, and will be given in §2.1.2.

1.2.5 ∞-Groupoids and Classical Homotopy Theory

Let C be an ∞-category. We will say that C is an ∞-groupoid if the homotopy category hC is a groupoid: in
other words, if every morphism in C is an equivalence. In §1.1.1, we asserted that the theory of ∞-groupoids
is equivalent to classical homotopy theory. We can now formulate this idea in a very precise way:

Proposition 1.2.5.1 (Joyal [43]). Let C be a simplicial set. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The simplicial set C is an ∞-category and its homotopy category hC is a groupoid.

38

(2) The simplicial set C satisﬁes the extension condition for all horn inclusions Λn

(3) The simplicial set C satisﬁes the extension condition for all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n for 0 ≤ i < n.
i ⊆ ∆n for 0 < i ≤ n.

(4) The simplicial set C is a Kan complex; in other words, it satisﬁes the extension condition for all horn

inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.

Proof. The equivalence (1) ⇔ (2) follows immediately from Proposition 1.2.4.3. Similarly, the equivalence
(1) ⇔ (3) follows by applying Proposition 1.2.4.3 to Cop. We conclude by observing that (4) ⇔ (2) ∧ (3).

Remark 1.2.5.2. The assertion that we can identify ∞-groupoids with spaces is less obvious in other for-
mulations of higher category theory. For example, suppose that C is a topological category whose homotopy
category hC is a groupoid. For simplicity, we will assume furthermore that C has a single object X. We
may then identify C with the topological monoid M = HomC(X, X). The assumption that hC is a groupoid
is equivalent to the assumption that the discrete monoid π0M is a group. In this case, one can show that
the unit map M → ΩBM is a weak homotopy equivalence, where BM denotes the classifying space of
the topological monoid M . In other words, up to equivalence, specifying C (together with the object X) is
equivalent to specifying the space BM (together with its base point).

Informally, we might say that the inclusion functor i from Kan complexes to ∞-categories exhibits
the ∞-category of (small) ∞-groupoids as a full subcategory of the ∞-bicategory of (small) ∞-categories.
Conversely, every ∞-category C has an “underlying” ∞-groupoid, which is obtained by discarding the non-
invertible morphisms of C:

Proposition 1.2.5.3 ([44]). Let C be an ∞-category. Let C′ ⊆ C be the largest simplicial subset of C having
the property that every edge of C′ is an equivalence in C. Then C′ is a Kan complex. It may be characterized by
the following universal property: for any Kan complex K, the induced map HomSet∆(K, C′) → HomSet∆ (K, C)
is a bijection.

Proof. It is straightforward to check that C′ is an ∞-category. Moreover, if f is a morphism in C′, then f
has a homotopy inverse g ∈ C. Since g is itself an equivalence in C, we conclude that g belongs to C′ and is
therefore a homotopy inverse to f in C′. In other words, every morphism in C′ is an equivalence, so that C′
is a Kan complex by Proposition 1.2.5.1. To prove the last assertion, we observe that if K is an ∞-category,
then any map of simplicial sets φ : K → C carries equivalences in K to equivalences in C. In particular, if K
is a Kan complex, then φ factors (uniquely) through C′.

It follows from Proposition 1.2.5.3 that the functor C 7→ C′ is right adjoint to the inclusion functor from
Kan complexes to ∞-categories. It is easy to see that this right adjoint is an invariant notion: that is, a
categorical equivalence of ∞-categories C → D induces a homotopy equivalence C′ → D′ of Kan complexes.

Remark 1.2.5.4. It is easy to give analogous constructions in the case of topological or simplicial categories.
For example, if C is a topological category, then we can deﬁne C′ to be another topological category with
the same objects as C, where MapC′(X, Y ) ⊆ MapC(X, Y ) is the subspace consisting of equivalences in
MapC(X, Y ), equipped with the subspace topology.

Remark 1.2.5.5. We will later introduce a relative version of the construction described in Proposition
1.2.5.3, which applies to certain families of ∞-categories (Corollary 2.4.2.5).

Although the inclusion functor from Kan complexes to ∞-categories does not literally have a left adjoint,
it does have a left adjoint in a higher-categorical sense. This left adjoint is computed by any “ﬁbrant
replacement” functor (for the usual model structure) from Set∆ to itself, for example the functor S 7→ Sing |S|.
The unit map u : S → Sing |S| is always a weak homotopy equivalence, but generally not a categorical
equivalence. For example, if S is an ∞-category, then u is a categorical equivalence if and only if S is a
Kan complex. In general, Sing |S| may be regarded as the ∞-groupoid obtained from S by freely adjoining
inverses to all the morphisms in S.

39

Remark 1.2.5.6. The inclusion functor i and its homotopy-theoretic left adjoint may also be understood
using the formalism of localizations of model categories. In addition to its usual model category structure,
the category Set∆ of simplicial sets may be endowed with the Joyal model structure which we will deﬁne
in §2.2.5. These model structures have the same coﬁbrations (in both cases, the coﬁbrations are simply
the monomorphisms of simplicial sets). However, the Joyal model structure has fewer weak equivalences
(categorical equivalences, rather than weak homotopy equivalences) and consequently more ﬁbrant objects
(all ∞-categories, rather than only Kan complexes). It follows that the usual homotopy theory of simplicial
sets is a localization of the homotopy theory of ∞-categories. The identity functor from Set∆ to itself
determines a Quillen adjunction between these two homotopy theories, which plays the role of i and its left
adjoint.

1.2.6 Homotopy Commutativity versus Homotopy Coherence

Let C be an ∞-category (topological category, simplicial category). To a ﬁrst approximation, working in C is
like working in its homotopy category hC: up to equivalence, C and hC have the same objects and morphisms.
The main diﬀerence between hC and C is that in C, one must not ask whether or not morphisms are equal;
instead one should ask whether or not they are homotopic. If so, the homotopy itself is an additional datum
which we will need to consider. Consequently, the notion of a commutative diagram in hC, which corresponds
to a homotopy commutative diagram in C, is quite unnatural and usually needs to be replaced by the more
reﬁned notion of a homotopy coherent diagram in C.

To understand the problem, let us suppose that F : I → H is a functor from an ordinary category I into
the homotopy category of spaces H. In other words, F assigns to each object X ∈ I a space (say, a CW
complex) F (X), and to each morphism φ : X → Y in I a continuous map of spaces F (φ) : F (X) → F (Y )
(well-deﬁned up to homotopy), such that F (φ ◦ ψ) is homotopic to F (φ) ◦ F (ψ) for any pair of composable
morphisms φ, ψ in I. In this situation, it may or may not be possible to lift F to an actual functor
F from
F induces a functor I → H which is naturally
I to the ordinary category of topological spaces, such that
F ,
isomorphic to F . In general there are obstructions to both the existence and the uniqueness of the lifting
even up to homotopy. To see this, let us suppose for a moment that
F exists, so that there exist homotopies
kφ :
F (φ) ≃ F (φ). These homotopies determine additional data on F : namely, one obtains a canonical
e
homotopy hφ,ψ from F (φ ◦ ψ) to F (φ) ◦ F (ψ) by composing

e

e

e

e

F (φ ◦ ψ) ≃

F (φ ◦ ψ) =

F (φ) ◦

F (ψ) ≃ F (φ) ◦ F (ψ).

e

e

e

The functor F to the homotopy category H should be viewed as a ﬁrst approximation to
F ; we obtain a
second approximation when we take into account the homotopies hφ,ψ. These homotopies are not arbitrary:
the associativity of composition gives a relationship between hφ,ψ, hψ,θ, hφ,ψ◦θ and hφ◦ψ,θ, for a composable
triple of morphisms (φ, ψ, θ) in I. This relationship may be formulated in terms of the existence of a certain
higher homotopy, which is once again canonically determined by
F (and the homotopies kφ). To obtain
the next approximation to
F , we should take these higher homotopies into account, and formulate the
associativity properties that they enjoy, and so on. Roughly speaking, a homotopy coherent diagram in C is
e
a functor F : I → hC, together with all of the extra data that would be available if we were able to lift F to
a functor

F : I → C.

e

e

The distinction between homotopy commutativity and homotopy coherence is arguably the main diﬃculty
in working with higher categories. The idea of homotopy coherence is simple enough, and can be made precise
in the setting of a general topological category. However, the amount of data required to specify a homotopy
coherent diagram is considerable, so the concept is quite diﬃcult to employ in practical situations.

e

Remark 1.2.6.1. Let I be an ordinary category and C a topological category. Any functor F : I → C
determines a homotopy coherent diagram in C (with all of the homotopies involved being constant). For
many topological categories C, the converse fails: not every homotopy-coherent diagram in C can be obtained
in this way, even up to equivalence. In these cases, it is the notion of homotopy coherent diagram which is
fundamental; a homotopy coherent diagram should be regarded as “just as good” as a strictly commutative

40

diagram, for ∞-categorical purposes. As evidence for this, we remark that given an equivalence C′ → C, a
strictly commutative diagram F : I → C cannot always be lifted to a strictly commutative diagram in C′;
however it can always be lifted (up to equivalence) to a homotopy coherent diagram in C′.

One of the advantages of working with ∞-categories is that the deﬁnition of a homotopy coherent diagram
is easy to formulate. We can simply deﬁne a homotopy coherent diagram in an ∞-category C to be a map
of simplicial sets f : N(I) → C. The restriction of f to simplices of low dimension encodes the induced map
on homotopy categories. Specifying f on higher-dimensional simplices gives precisely the “coherence data”
that the above discussion calls for.

Remark 1.2.6.2. Another possible approach to the problem of homotopy coherence is to restrict our
attention to simplicial (or topological) categories C in which every homotopy coherent diagram is equivalent
to a strictly commutative diagram. For example, this is always true when C arises from a simplicial model
category (Proposition 4.2.4.4). Consequently, in the framework of model categories it is possible to ignore
the theory of homotopy coherent diagrams, and work with strictly commutative diagrams instead. This
approach is quite powerful, particularly when combined with the observation that every simplicial category
C admits a fully faithful embedding into a simplicial model category (for example, one can use a simplicially
enriched version of the Yoneda embedding). This idea can be used to show that every homotopy coherent
diagram in C can be “straightened” to a commutative diagram, possibly after replacing C by an equivalent
simplicial category (for a more precise version of this statement, we refer the reader to Corollary 4.2.4.7).

1.2.7 Functors between Higher Categories

The notion of a homotopy coherent diagram in an higher category C is a special case of the more general
notion of a functor F : I → C between higher categories (speciﬁcally, it is the special case in which I is
assumed to be an ordinary category). Just as the collection of all ordinary categories forms a bicategory
(with functors as morphisms and natural transformations as 2-morphisms), the collection of all ∞-categories
can be organized into an ∞-bicategory. In particular, for any ∞-categories C and C′, we expect to be able
to construct an ∞-category Fun(C, C′) of functors from C to C′.

In the setting of topological categories, the construction of an appropriate mapping object Fun(C, C′) is
quite diﬃcult. The naive guess is that Fun(C, C′) should be a category of topological functors from C to C′:
that is, functors which induce continuous maps between morphism spaces. However, we saw in §1.2.6 that
this notion is generally too rigid, even in the special case where C is an ordinary category.

Remark 1.2.7.1. Using the language of model categories, one might say that the problem is that not every
topological category is coﬁbrant. If C is a “coﬁbrant” topological category (for example, if C = | C[S]| where
S is a simplicial set), then the collection of topological functors from C to C′ is large enough to contain
representatives for every ∞-categorical functor from C to C′. Most ordinary categories are not coﬁbrant
when viewed as topological categories. More importantly, the property of being coﬁbrant is not stable under
products, so that naive attempts to construct a mapping object Fun(C, C′) need not give the correct answer
even when C itself is assumed coﬁbrant (if C is coﬁbrant, then we are guaranteed to have “enough” topological
functors C → C′ to represent all functors between the underlying ∞-categories, but not necessarily enough
natural transformations between them; note that the product C ×[1] is usually not coﬁbrant, even in the
simplest nontrivial case where C = [1].) This is arguably the most important technical disadvantage of the
theory of topological (or simplicial) categories as an approach to higher category theory.

The construction of functor categories is much easier to describe in the framework of ∞-categories. If
C and D are ∞-categories, then we can simply deﬁne a functor from C to D to be a map p : C → D of
simplicial sets.

Notation 1.2.7.2. Let C and D be simplicial sets. We let Fun(C, D) denote the simplicial set MapSet∆ (C, D)
parametrizing maps from C to D. We will use this notation only when D is an ∞-category (the simplicial
set C will often, but not always, be an ∞-category as well). We will refer to Fun(C, D) as the ∞-category

41

of functors from C to D (see Proposition 1.2.7.3 below). We will refer to morphisms in Fun(C, D) as natural
transformations of functors, and equivalences in Fun(C, D) as natural equivalences.

Proposition 1.2.7.3. Let K be an arbitrary simplicial set.

(1) For every ∞-category C, the simplicial set Fun(K, C) is an ∞-category.

(2) Let C → D be a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories. Then the induced map Fun(K, C) → Fun(K, D)

is a categorical equivalence.

(3) Let C be an ∞-category, and K → K ′ a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets. Then the induced

map Fun(K ′, C) → Fun(K, C) is a categorical equivalence.

The proof makes use of the Joyal model structure on Set∆, and will be given in §2.2.5.

1.2.8 Joins of ∞-Categories
Let C and C′ be ordinary categories. We will deﬁne a new category C ⋆ C′, called the join of C and C′. An
object of C ⋆ C′ is either an object of C or an object of C′. The morphism sets are given as follows:

HomC(X, Y )
HomC′(X, Y )
∅
∗

if X, Y ∈ C
if X, Y ∈ C′
if X ∈ C′, Y ∈ C
if X ∈ C, Y ∈ C′ .

HomC ⋆ C′(X, Y ) = 



Composition of morphisms in C ⋆ C′ is deﬁned in the obvious way.

The join construction described above is often useful when discussing diagram categories, limits, and
colimits. In this section, we will introduce a generalization of this construction to the ∞-categorical setting.

Deﬁnition 1.2.8.1. If S and S′ are simplicial sets, then the simplicial set S ⋆ S′ is deﬁned as follows: for
each nonempty ﬁnite linearly ordered set J, we set

(S ⋆ S′)(J) =

S(I) × S′(I ′),

aJ=I∪I ′
where the union is taken over all decompositions of J into disjoint subsets I and I ′, satisfying i < i′ for
all i ∈ I, i′ ∈ I ′. Here we allow the possibility that either I or I ′ is empty, in which case we agree to the
convention that S(∅) = S′(∅) = ∗.

More concretely, we have

(S ⋆ S′)n = Sn ∪ S′

n ∪

Si × S′
j.

The join operation endows Set∆ with the structure of a monoidal category (see §A.1.3). The identity
for the join operation is the empty simplicial set ∅ = ∆−1. More generally, we have natural isomorphisms
φij : ∆i−1 ⋆ ∆j−1 ≃ ∆(i+j)−1, for all i, j ≥ 0.

i+j=n−1
[

Remark 1.2.8.2. The operation ⋆ is essentially determined by the isomorphisms φij , together with its
behavior under the formation of colimits: for any ﬁxed simplicial set S, the functors

T 7→ T ⋆ S

T 7→ S ⋆ T

commute with colimits, when regarded as functors from Set∆ to the undercategory (Set∆)S/ of simplicial
sets under S.

42

Passage to the nerve carries joins of categories into joins of simplicial sets. More precisely, for every pair

of categories C and C′, there is a canonical isomorphism

N(C ⋆ C′) ≃ N(C) ⋆ N(C′).

(The existence of this isomorphism persists when we allow C and C′ to be a simplicial or topological categories
and apply the appropriate generalization of the nerve functor.) This suggests that the join operation on
simplicial sets is the appropriate ∞-categorical analogue of the join operation on categories.

We remark that the formation of joins does not commute with the functor C[•]. However, the simplicial
category C[S ⋆ S′] contains C[S] and C[S′] as full (topological) subcategories, and contains no morphisms
from objects of C[S′] to objects of C[S]. Consequently, there is unique map φ : C[S ⋆ S′] → C[S] ⋆ C[S′] which
reduces to the identity on C[S] and C[S′]. We will later show that φ is an equivalence of simplicial categories
(Corollary 4.2.1.4).

We conclude by recording a pleasant property of the join operation:

Proposition 1.2.8.3 (Joyal [44]). If S and S′ are ∞-categories, then S ⋆ S′ is an ∞-category.

i → S ⋆ S′ be a map, with 0 < i < n. If p carries Λn

Proof. Let p : Λn
i entirely into S ⊆ S ⋆ S′ or into
S′ ⊆ S ⋆ S′, then we deduce the existence an extension of p to ∆n by invoking the assumption that S and S′
are ∞-categories. Otherwise, we may suppose that p carries the vertices {0, . . . , j} into S, and the vertices
{j + 1, . . . , n} into S′. We may now restrict p to obtain maps

∆{0,...,j} → S

∆{j+1,...,n} → S′,

which together determine a map ∆n → S ⋆ S′ extending p.

Notation 1.2.8.4. Let K be a simplicial set. The left cone K ⊳ is deﬁned to be the join ∆0 ⋆ K. Dually,
the right cone K ⊲ is deﬁned to be the join K ⋆ ∆0. Either cone contains a distinguished vertex (belonging
to ∆0), which we will refer to as the cone point.

1.2.9 Overcategories and Undercategories

Let C be an ordinary category, and X ∈ C an object. The overcategory C/X is deﬁned as follows: the objects
of C/X are morphisms Y → X in C having target X. Morphisms are given by commutative triangles

Y

 @@@@@@@

X

/ Z

~~~~~~~~

and composition is deﬁned in the obvious way.

One can rephrase the deﬁnition of the overcategory as follows. Let [0] denote the category with a single
object, possessing only an identity morphism. Then specifying an object X ∈ C is equivalent to specifying
a functor x : [0] → C. The overcategory C/X may then be described by the following universal property: for
any category C′, we have a bijection

Hom(C′, C/X ) ≃ Homx(C′ ⋆[0], C),

where the subscript on the right hand side indicates that we consider only those functors C′ ⋆[0] → C whose
restriction to [0] coincides with x.

We would like to generalize the construction of overcategories to the ∞-categorical setting. Let us begin
by working in the framework of topological categories. In this case, there is a natural candidate for the

43

 
/
~
relevant overcategory. Namely, if C is a topological category containing an object X, then the overcategory
C/X (deﬁned as above) has the structure of a topological category, where each morphism space MapC/X (Y, Z)
is topologized as a subspace of MapC(Y, Z) (here we are identifying an object of C/X with its image in C).
This topological category is usually not a model for the correct ∞-categorical slice construction. The problem
is that a morphism in C/X consists of a commutative triangle

Y

 @@@@@@@

X

/ Z

~~~~~~~~

of objects over X. To obtain the correct notion, we should allow also triangles which commute only up to
homotopy.

Remark 1.2.9.1. In some cases, the naive overcategory C/X is a good approximation to the correct con-
struction: see Lemma 6.1.3.13.

In the setting of ∞-categories, Joyal has given a much simpler description of the desired construction
(see [43]). This description will play a vitally important role throughout this book. We begin by noting the
following:

Proposition 1.2.9.2 ([43]). Let S and K be simplicial sets, and p : K → S an arbitrary map. There exists
a simplicial set S/p with the following universal property:

HomSet∆(Y, S/p) = Homp(Y ⋆ K, S),

where the subscript on the right hand side indicates that we consider only those morphisms f : Y ⋆ K → S
such that f |K = p.

Proof. One deﬁnes (S/p)n to be Homp(∆n ⋆ K, S). The universal property holds by deﬁnition when Y is a
simplex. It holds in general because both sides are compatible with the formation of colimits in Y .

Let p : K → S be as in Proposition 1.2.9.2. If S is an ∞-category, we will refer to S/p as an overcategory
of S, or as the ∞-category of objects of S over p. The following result guarantees that the operation of
passing to overcategories is well-behaved:

Proposition 1.2.9.3. Let p : K → C be a map of simplicial sets, and suppose that C is an ∞-category.
Then C/p is an ∞-category. Moreover, if q : C → C′ is a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories, then the
induced map C/p → C′

/qp is a categorical equivalence as well.

The proof requires a number of ideas which we have not yet introduced, and will be postponed (see

Proposition 2.1.2.2 for the ﬁrst assertion and §2.4.5 for the second).

Remark 1.2.9.4. Let C be an ∞-category. In the particular case where p : ∆n → C classiﬁes an n-simplex
σ ∈ Cn, we will often write C/σ in place of of C/p. In particular, if X is an object of C, we let C/X denote
the overcategory C/p, where p : ∆0 → C has image X.

Remark 1.2.9.5. Let p : K → C be a map of simplicial sets. The preceding discussion can be dualized,
replacing Y ⋆ K by K ⋆ Y ; in this case we denote the corresponding simplicial set by Cp/ which (if C is an
∞-category) we will refer to as an undercategory of C. In the special case where K = ∆n and p classiﬁes a
simplex σ ∈ Cn, we will also write Cσ/ for Cp/; in particular, we will write CX/ when X is an object of C.

Remark 1.2.9.6. If C is an ordinary category and X ∈ C, then there is a canonical isomorphism N(C)/X ≃
N(C/X ). In other words, the overcategory construction for ∞-categories can be regarded as a generalization
of the relevant construction from classical category theory.

1.2.10 Fully Faithful and Essentially Surjective Functors

Deﬁnition 1.2.10.1. Let F : C → D be a functor between topological categories (simplicial categories,
simplicial sets). We will say that F is essentially surjective if the induced functor hF : hC → hD is
essentially surjective (that is, if every object of D is equivalent to F (X) for some X ∈ C).

We will say that F is fully faithful if hF is a fully faithful functor of H-enriched categories. In other
words, F is fully faithful if and only if, for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the induced map MaphC(X, Y ) →
MaphD(F (X), F (Y )) is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H.
Remark 1.2.10.2. Because Deﬁnition 1.2.10.1 makes reference only to the homotopy categories of C and
D, it is invariant under equivalence and under operations which pass between the various models for higher
category theory that we have introduced.

Just as in ordinary category theory, a functor F is an equivalence if and only if it is fully faithful and

essentially surjective.

1.2.11 Subcategories of ∞-Categories

Let C be an ∞-category, and let (hC)′ ⊆ hC be a subcategory of its homotopy category. We can then form
a pullback diagram of simplicial sets

C′

C

N(hC)′

/ N(hC).

We will refer to C′ as the subcategory of C spanned by (hC)′. In general, we will say that a simplicial subset
C′ ⊆ C is a subcategory of C if it arises via this construction.

Remark 1.2.11.1. We say “subcategory”, rather than “sub-∞-category”, in order to avoid awkward lan-
guage. The terminology is not meant to suggest that C′ is itself a category, or isomorphic to the nerve of a
category.

In the case where (hC)′ is a full subcategory of hC, we will say that C′ is a full subcategory of C. In this
0 of those objects X ∈ C which belong to C′. We will then say that C′ is

case, C′ is determined by the set C′
the full subcategory of C spanned by C′
0.

It follows from Remark 1.2.2.4 that the inclusion C′ ⊆ C is fully faithful. In general, any fully faithful

functor f : C′′ → C factors as a composition

→ C′ f ′′
where f ′ is an equivalence of ∞-categories and f ′′ is the inclusion of the full subcategory C′ ⊆ C spanned by
the set of objects f (C′′

C′′ f ′

→ C,

0 ) ⊆ C0.

1.2.12

Initial and Final Objects

If C is an ordinary category, then an object X ∈ C is said to be ﬁnal if HomC(Y, X) consists of a single
element, for every Y ∈ C. Dually, an object X ∈ C is initial if it is ﬁnal when viewed as an object of Cop.
The goal of this section is to generalize these deﬁnitions to the ∞-categorical setting.

If C is a topological category, then a candidate deﬁnition immediately presents itself: we could ignore
the topology on the morphism spaces, and consider those objects of C which are ﬁnal when C is regarded as
an ordinary category. This requirement is unnaturally strong. For example, the category CG of compactly
generated Hausdorﬀ spaces has a ﬁnal object: the topological space ∗, consisting of a single point. However,
there are objects of CG which are equivalent to ∗ (any contractible space) but not isomorphic to ∗ (and
therefore not ﬁnal objects of CG, at least in the classical sense). Since any reasonable ∞-categorical notion
is stable under equivalence, we need to ﬁnd a weaker condition.

Deﬁnition 1.2.12.1. Let C be a topological category (simplicial category, simplicial set). An object X ∈ C
is ﬁnal if it is ﬁnal in the homotopy category hC, regarded as a category enriched over H. In other words,
X is ﬁnal if and only if for each Y ∈ C, the mapping space MaphC(Y, X) is weakly contractible (that is, a
ﬁnal object of H).

Remark 1.2.12.2. Since the Deﬁnition 1.2.12.1 makes reference only to the homotopy category hC, it is
invariant under equivalence and under passing between the various models for higher category theory.

In the setting of ∞-categories, it is convenient to employ a slightly more sophisticated deﬁnition, which

we borrow from [43].

Deﬁnition 1.2.12.3. Let C be a simplicial set. A vertex X of C is strongly ﬁnal if the projection C/X → C
is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

In other words, a vertex X of C is strongly ﬁnal if and only if any map f0 : ∂ ∆n → C such that f0(n) = X

can be extended to a map f : ∆n → S.

Proposition 1.2.12.4. Let C be an ∞-category containing an object Y . The object Y is strongly ﬁnal if
and only if, for every object X ∈ C, the Kan complex HomR

C (X, Y ) is contractible.

Proof. The “only if” direction is clear: the space HomR
C (X, Y ) is the ﬁber of the projection p : C/Y → C
over the vertex X. If p is a trivial ﬁbration, then the ﬁber is a contractible Kan complex. Since p is a right
ﬁbration (Proposition 2.1.2.1), the converse holds as well (Lemma 2.1.3.4).

Corollary 1.2.12.5. Let C be a simplicial set. Every strongly ﬁnal object of C is a ﬁnal object of C. The
converse holds if C is an ∞-category.

Proof. Let [0] denote the category with a single object and a single morphism. Suppose that Y is a strongly
ﬁnal vertex of C. Then there exists a retraction of C⊲ onto C, carrying the cone point to Y . Consequently,
we obtain a retraction of (H-enriched) homotopy categories from (hC) ⋆ [0 ] to hC, carrying the unique object
of [0] to Y . This implies that Y is ﬁnal in hC, so that Y is a ﬁnal object of C.
To prove the converse, we note that if C is an ∞-category then HomR

C (X, Y ) represents the homotopy
type MapC(X, Y ) ∈ H; by Proposition 1.2.12.4 this space is contractible for all X if and only if Y is strongly
ﬁnal.

Remark 1.2.12.6. The above discussion dualizes in an evident way, so that we have a notion of initial
objects of an ∞-category C.

Example 1.2.12.7. Let C be an ordinary category containing an object X. Then X is a ﬁnal (initial) object
of the ∞-category N(C) if and only if it is a ﬁnal (initial) object of C, in the usual sense.

Remark 1.2.12.8. Deﬁnition 1.2.12.3 is only natural in the case where C is an ∞-category. For example, if
C is not an ∞-category, then the collection of strongly ﬁnal vertices of C need not be stable under equivalence.

An ordinary category C may have more than one ﬁnal object, but any two ﬁnal objects are uniquely
isomorphic to one another. In the setting of ∞-categories, an analogous statement holds, but is slightly
more complicated because the word “unique” needs to be interpreted in a homotopy theoretic sense:

Proposition 1.2.12.9 (Joyal). Let C be a ∞-category, and let C′ be the full subcategory of C spanned by the
ﬁnal vertices of C. Then C′ is either empty or a contractible Kan complex.

Proof. We wish to prove that every map p : ∂ ∆n → C′ can be extended to an n-simplex of C′. If n = 0,
this is possible unless C′ is empty. For n > 0, the desired extension exists because p carries the nth vertex
of ∂ ∆n to a ﬁnal object of C.

1.2.13 Limits and Colimits

An important consequence of the distinction between homotopy commutativity and homotopy coherence is
that the appropriate notions of limit and colimit in a higher category C do not coincide with the notion of
limit and colimit in the homotopy category hC (where limits and colimits often do not exist). Limits and
colimits in C are often referred to as homotopy limits and homotopy colimits, to avoid confusing them with
ordinary limits and colimits.

Homotopy limits and colimits can be deﬁned in a topological category, but the deﬁnition is rather
complicated. We will review a few special cases here, and discuss the general deﬁnition in the appendix
(§A.2.8).

Example 1.2.13.1. Let {Xα} be a family of objects in a topological category C. A homotopy product
α Xα is an object of C equipped with morphisms fα : X → Xα which induce a weak homotopy
X =
equivalence

Q

for every object Y ∈ C.

MapC(Y, X) →

MapC(Y, Xα)

α
Y

Passing to path components and using the fact that π0 commutes with products, we deduce that

HomhC(Y, X) ≃

HomhC(Y, Xα),

α
Y
so that any product in C is also a product in hC. In particular, the object X is determined up to canonical
isomorphism in hC.

In the special case where the index set is empty, we recover the notion of a ﬁnal object of C: an object

X for which each of the mapping spaces MapC(Y, X) is weakly contractible.

Example 1.2.13.2. Given two morphisms π : X → Z and ψ : Y → Z in a topological category C, let us
deﬁne MapC(W, X ×h
Z Y ) to be the space consisting of points p ∈ MapC(W, X), q ∈ MapC(W, Y ), together
with a path r : [0, 1] → MapC(W, Z) joining π ◦ p to ψ ◦ q. We endow MapC(W, X ×h
Z Y ) with the obvious
topology, so that X ×h
Z Y can be viewed presheaf of topological spaces on C. A homotopy ﬁber product for X
and Y over Z is an object of C which represents this presheaf, up to weak homotopy equivalence. In other
words, it is an object P ∈ C equipped with a point p ∈ MapC(P, X ×h
Z Y ) which induces weak homotopy
equivalences MapC(W, P ) → MapC(W, X ×h

Z Y ) for every W ∈ C.
We note that, if there exists a ﬁber product (in the ordinary sense) X ×Z Y in the category C, then
this ordinary ﬁber product admits a (canonically determined) map to the homotopy ﬁber product (if the
homotopy ﬁber product exists). This map need not be an equivalence, but it is an equivalence in many
good cases. We also note that a homotopy ﬁber product P comes equipped with a map to the ﬁber product
X ×Z Y taken in the category hC (if this ﬁber product exists); this map is usually not an isomorphism.

Remark 1.2.13.3. Homotopy limits and colimits in general may be described in relation to homotopy
limits of topological spaces. The homotopy limit X of a diagram of objects {Xα} in an arbitrary topological
category C is determined, up to equivalence, by the condition that there exist a natural weak homotopy
equivalence

MapC(Y, X) ≃ holim{MapC(Y, Xα)}.

Similarly, the homotopy colimit of the diagram is characterized by the existence of a natural weak homotopy
equivalence

MapC(X, Y ) ≃ holim{MapC(Xα, Y )}.

For a more precise discussion, we refer the reader to Remark A.3.3.13.

In the setting of ∞-categories, limits and colimits are quite easy to deﬁne:

47

Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4 (Joyal [43]). Let C be an ∞-category and let p : K → C be an arbitrary map of
simplicial sets. A colimit for p is an initial object of Cp/ and a limit for p is a ﬁnal object of C/p.

Remark 1.2.13.5. According to Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4, a colimit of a diagram p : K → C is an object of
Cp/. We may identify this object with a map p : K ⊲ → C extending p. In general, we will say that a map
p : K ⊲ → C is a colimit diagram if it is a colimit of p = p|K. In this case, we will also abuse terminology by
referring to p(∞) ∈ C as a colimit of p, where ∞ denotes the cone point of K ⊲.

If p : K → C is a diagram, we will sometimes write lim
−→

(p) to denote a colimit of p (considered either
(p) to denote a limit of p (as either an object of C/p or an object
as an object of Cp/ or of C), and lim
←−
of C). This notation is slightly abusive, since lim
(p) is not uniquely determined by p. This phenomenon is
−→
familiar in classical category theory: the colimit of a diagram is not unique, but is determined up to canonical
isomorphism. In the ∞-categorical setting, we have a similar uniqueness result: Proposition 1.2.12.9 implies
that the collection of candidates for lim
−→

(p), if nonempty, is parametrized by a contractible Kan complex.

Remark 1.2.13.6. In §4.2.4, we will show that Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4 agrees with the classical theory of
homotopy (co)limits, when we specialize to the case where C is the nerve of a topological category.

Remark 1.2.13.7. Let C be an ∞-category, C′ ⊆ C a full subcategory, and p : K → C′ a diagram. Then
p/ = C′ ×C Cp/. In particular, if p has a colimit in C, and that colimit belongs to C′, then the same object
C′
may be regarded as a colimit for p in C′.

Let f : C → C′ be a map between ∞-categories. Let p : K → C be a diagram in C, having a colimit
x ∈ Cp/. The image f (x) ∈ C′
f p/ may or may not be a colimit for the composite map f ◦ p. If it is, we will
say that f preserves the colimit of the diagram p. Often we will apply this terminology not to a particular
diagram p but some class of diagrams: for example, we may speak of maps f which preserve coproducts,
pushouts, or ﬁltered colimits (see §4.4 for a discussion of special classes of colimits). Similarly, we may ask
whether or not a map f preserves the limit of a particular diagram, or various families of diagrams.

We conclude this section by giving a simple example of a colimit-preserving functor.

Proposition 1.2.13.8. Let C be an ∞-category, q : T → C and p : K → C/q two diagrams. Let p0 denote
the composition of p with the projection C/q → C. Suppose that p0 has a colimit in C. Then:

(1) The diagram p has a colimit in C/q, and that colimit is preserved by the projection C/q → C.

(2) An extension

p : K ⊲ → C/q is a colimit of p if and only if the composition

e

is a colimit of p0.

K ⊲ → C/q → C

p0 : K ⊲ → C
Proof. We ﬁrst prove the “if” direction of (2). Let
p with a map K ⋆ ∆0 ⋆ T → C.
is a colimit of p0. We wish to show that
For this, it suﬃces to show that for any inclusion A ⊆ B of simplicial sets, it is possible to solve the lifting
problem depicted in the following diagram:
e

p : K ⊲ → C/q be such that the composite map

p is a colimit of p. We may identify

We now prove (1). Let

1.2.14 Presentations of ∞-Categories

e

e

Like many other types of mathematical structures, ∞-categories can be described by generators and relations.
In particular, it makes sense to speak of a ﬁnitely presented ∞-category C. Roughly speaking, C is ﬁnitely
presented if it has ﬁnitely many objects and its morphism spaces are determined by specifying a ﬁnite number
of generating morphisms, a ﬁnite number of relations among these generating morphisms, a ﬁnite number
of relations among the relations, and so forth (a ﬁnite number of relations in all).

Example 1.2.14.1. Let C be the free higher category generated by a single object X and a single morphism
f : X → X. Then C is a ﬁnitely presented ∞-category with a single object, and HomC(X, X) = {1, f, f 2, . . .}
is inﬁnite and discrete. In particular, we note that the ﬁnite presentation of C does not guarantee ﬁniteness
properties of the morphism spaces.

Example 1.2.14.2. If we identify ∞-groupoids with spaces, then giving a presentation for an ∞-groupoid
corresponds to giving a cell decomposition of the associated space. Consequently, the ﬁnitely presented
∞-groupoids correspond precisely to the ﬁnite cell complexes.

Example 1.2.14.3. Suppose that C is a higher category with only two objects X and Y , and that X and
Y have contractible endomorphism spaces and that HomC(X, Y ) is empty. Then C is completely determined
by the morphism space HomC(Y, X), which may be arbitrary. In this case, C is ﬁnitely presented if and only
if HomC(Y, X) is a ﬁnite cell complex (up to homotopy equivalence).

The idea of giving a presentation for an ∞-category is very naturally encoded in the theory of simplicial
sets; more speciﬁcally, in Joyal’s model structure on Set∆, which we will discuss in §2.2.4. This model
structure can be described as follows:

• The ﬁbrant objects of Set∆ are precisely the ∞-categories.

• The weak equivalences in Set∆ are precisely those maps p : S → S′ which induce equivalences C[S] →

C[S′] of simplicial categories.

If S is an arbitrary simplicial set, we can choose a “ﬁbrant replacement” for S; that is, a categorical
equivalence S → C where C is an ∞-category. For example, we can take C to be the nerve of the topological
category | C[S]|. The ∞-category C is well-deﬁned up to equivalence, and we may regard it as an ∞-category
which is “generated by” S. The simplicial set S itself can be thought of as a “blueprint” for building C. We
may view S as generated from the empty (simplicial) set by adjoining nondegenerate simplices. Adjoining
a 0-simplex to S has the eﬀect of adding an object to the ∞-category C, and adjoining a 1-simplex to S
has the eﬀect of adjoining a morphism to C. Higher dimensional simplices can be thought of as encoding
relations among the morphisms.

1.2.15 Set-Theoretic Technicalities

In ordinary category theory, one frequently encounters categories in which the collection of objects is too large
to form a set. Generally speaking, this does not create any diﬃculties so long as we avoid doing anything
which is obviously illegal (such as considering the “category of all categories” as an object of itself).

The same issues arise in the setting of higher category theory, and are in some sense even more of a
nuisance. In ordinary category theory, one generally allows a category C to have a proper class of objects,

49

but still requires HomC(X, Y ) to be a set for ﬁxed objects X, Y ∈ C. The formalism of ∞-categories treats
objects and morphisms on the same footing (they are both simplices of a simplicial set), and it is somewhat
unnatural (though certainly possible) to directly impose the analogous condition; see §5.4.1 for a discussion.
There are several means of handling the technical diﬃculties inherent in working with large objects (in

either classical or higher category theory):

(1) One can employ some set-theoretic device which enables one to distinguish between “large” and “small”.

Examples include:

– Assuming the existence of a suﬃcient supply of (Grothendieck) universes.

– Working in an axiomatic framework which allows both sets and classes (collections of sets which

are possibly too large to themselves be considered sets).

– Working in a standard set-theoretic framework (such as Zermelo-Frankel), but incorporating a
theory of classes through some ad-hoc device. For example, one can deﬁne a class to be a collection
of sets which is deﬁned by some formula in the language of set theory.

(2) One can work exclusively with “small” categories, and mirror the distinction between “large” and

“small” by keeping careful track of relative sizes.

(3) One can simply ignore the set-theoretic diﬃculties inherent in discussing “large” categories.

Needless to say, approach (2) yields the most reﬁned information. However, it has the disadvantage of
burdening our exposition with an additional layer of technicalities. On the other hand, approach (3) will
sometimes be inadequate, since we will need to make arguments which play oﬀ the distinction between a
“large” category and a “small” subcategory which determines it. Consequently, we shall oﬃcially adopt
approach (1) for the remainder of this book. More speciﬁcally, we assume that for every cardinal κ0, there
exists a strongly inaccessible cardinal κ ≥ κ0. We then let U(κ) denote the collection of all sets having rank
< κ, so that U(κ) is a Grothendieck universe: in other words, U(κ) satisﬁes all of the usual axioms of set
theory. We will refer to a mathematical object as small if it belongs to U(κ) (or is isomorphic to such an
object), and essentially small if it is equivalent (in whatever relevant sense) to a small object. Whenever
it is convenient to do so, we will choose another strongly inaccessible cardinal κ′ > κ, to obtain a larger
Grothendieck universe U(κ′) in which U(κ) becomes small.

For example, an ∞-category C is essentially small if and only if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

• The set of isomorphism classes of objects in the homotopy category hC has cardinality < κ.

• For every morphism f : X → Y in C and every i ≥ 0, the homotopy set πi(HomR

C (X, Y ), f ) has

cardinality < κ.

For a proof and further discussion, we refer the reader to §5.4.1.

Remark 1.2.15.1. The existence of the strongly inaccessible cardinal κ cannot be proven from the standard
axioms of set theory, and the assumption that κ exists cannot be proven consistent with the standard axioms
for set theory. However, it should be clear that assuming the existence of κ is merely the most convenient
of the devices mentioned above; none of the results proven in this book will depend on this assumption in
an essential way.

1.2.16 The ∞-Category of Spaces

The category of sets plays a central role in classical category theory. The main reason is that every category
C is enriched over sets: given a pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, we may regard HomC(X, Y ) as an object of Set. In
the higher categorical setting, the proper analogue of Set is the ∞-category S of spaces, which we will now
introduce.

50

Deﬁnition 1.2.16.1. Let Kan denote the full subcategory of Set∆ spanned by the collection of Kan com-
plexes. We will regard Kan as a simplicial category. Let S = N(Kan) denote the (simplicial) nerve of Kan.
We will refer to S as the ∞-category of spaces.

Remark 1.2.16.2. For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ Kan, the simplicial set MapKan(X, Y ) = Y X is a Kan
complex. It follows that S is an ∞-category (Proposition 1.1.5.10).

Remark 1.2.16.3. There are many other ways to obtain a suitable “∞-category of spaces”. For example,
we could instead deﬁne S to be the (topological) nerve of the category of CW-complexes and continuous
maps. All that really matters is that we have a ∞-category which is equivalent to S = N(Kan). We have
selected Deﬁnition 1.2.16.1 for deﬁniteness and to simplify our discussion of the Yoneda embedding in §5.1.3.

Remark 1.2.16.4. We will occasionally need to distinguish between “large” spaces and “small” spaces. In
such contexts, we will let S denote the ∞-category of small spaces (deﬁned by taking the simplicial nerve of
S the ∞-category of large spaces (deﬁned by taking the simplicial
the category of small Kan complexes), and
S is even
nerve of the category of all Kan complexes). We observe that S is a large ∞-category, and that
bigger.

Chapter 2

Fibrations of Simplicial Sets

Many classes of morphisms which play an important role in the homotopy theory of simplicial sets can be
deﬁned by their lifting properties (we refer the reader to §A.1.2 for a brief introduction and a summary of
the terminology employed below).

Example 2.0.0.1. A morphism p : X → S of simplicial sets which has the right lifting property with respect
to every horn inclusion Λn
i ⊆ ∆n is called a Kan ﬁbration. A morphism i : A → B which has the left lifting
property with respect to every Kan ﬁbration is said to be anodyne.

Example 2.0.0.2. A morphism p : X → S of simplicial sets which has the right lifting property with
respect to every inclusion ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n is called a trivial ﬁbration. A morphism i : A → B has the left lifting
property with respect to every trivial Kan ﬁbration if and only if it is a coﬁbration; that is, if and only if i
is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

By deﬁnition, a simplicial set S is a ∞-category if it has the extension property with respect to all horn
i ⊆ ∆n with 0 < i < n. As in classical homotopy theory, it is convenient to introduce a relative

inclusions Λn
version of this condition.

Deﬁnition 2.0.0.3 (Joyal). A morphism f : X → S of simplicial sets is

• a left ﬁbration if f has the right lifting property with respect to all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, 0 ≤ i < n.

• a right ﬁbration if f has the right lifting property with respect to all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, 0 < i ≤ n.

• an inner ﬁbration if f has the right lifting property with respect to all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n,

0 < i < n.

A morphism of simplicial sets i : A → B is

• left anodyne if i has the left lifting property with respect to all left ﬁbrations.

• right anodyne if i has the left lifting property with respect to all right ﬁbrations.

• inner anodyne if i has the left lifting property with respect to all inner ﬁbrations.

Remark 2.0.0.4. Joyal uses the terms mid-ﬁbration and mid-anodyne morphism for what we have called
inner ﬁbrations and inner anodyne morphisms.

The purpose of this chapter is to study the notions of ﬁbration deﬁned above, which are basic tools in
the theory of ∞-categories. In §2.1, we study the theory of right (left) ﬁbrations p : X → S, which can be
viewed as the ∞-categorical analogue of categories (co)ﬁbered in groupoids over S. We will apply these ideas
in §2.2 to show that the theory of ∞-categories is equivalent to the theory of simplicial categories.

52

There is also an analogue of the more general theory of (co)ﬁbered categories, whose ﬁbers are not
necessarily groupoids: this is the theory of (co)Cartesian ﬁbrations, which we will introduce in §2.4. Cartesian
and coCartesian ﬁbrations are both examples of inner ﬁbrations, which we will study in §2.3.

Remark 2.0.0.5. To help orient the reader, we summarize the relationship between many of the classes
of ﬁbrations which we will study in this book. If f : X → S is a map of simplicial sets, then we have the
following implications:

f is a trivial ﬁbration

f is a Kan ﬁbration

ggggggggggggggggggg
w ggggggggggggggggggg

/WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

f is a left ﬁbration

f is a right ﬁbration

f is a coCartesian ﬁbration

f is a Cartesian ﬁbration

/WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

ggggggggggggggggggg
w ggggggggggggggggggg

f is a categorical ﬁbration

In general, none of these implications is reversible.

f is an inner ﬁbration.

Remark 2.0.0.6. The small object argument (Proposition A.1.2.5) shows that every map X → Z of
simplicial sets admits a factorization

X

p
→ Y

q
→ Z,

where p is anodyne (left anodyne, right anodyne, inner anodyne, a coﬁbration) and q is a Kan ﬁbration (left
ﬁbration, right ﬁbration, inner ﬁbration, trivial ﬁbration).

Remark 2.0.0.7. The theory of left ﬁbrations (left anodyne maps) is dual to the theory of right ﬁbrations
(right anodyne maps): a map S → T is a left ﬁbration (left anodyne map) if and only if the induced map
Sop → T op is a right ﬁbration (right anodyne map). Consequently, we will generally conﬁne our remarks in
§2.1 to the case of left ﬁbrations; the analogous statements for right ﬁbrations will follow by duality.

2.1 Left Fibrations

In this section, we will study the class of left ﬁbrations between simplicial sets. We begin in §2.1.1 with a
review of some classical category theory: namely, the theory of categories coﬁbered in groupoids (over another
category). We will see that the theory of left ﬁbrations is a natural ∞-categorical generalization of this idea.
In §2.1.2 we will show that the class of left ﬁbrations is stable under various important constructions, such
as the formation of slice ∞-categories.

It follows immediately from the deﬁnition that every Kan ﬁbration of simplicial sets is a left ﬁbration.
The converse is false in general. However, it is possible to give a relatively simple criterion for testing whether
or not a left ﬁbration f : X → S is a Kan ﬁbration. We will establish this criterion in §2.1.3 and deduce
some of its consequences.

The classical theory of Kan ﬁbrations has a natural interpretation in the language of model categories:
a map p : X → S is a Kan ﬁbration if and only if X is a ﬁbrant object of (Set∆)/S, where the category
(Set∆)/S is equipped with its usual model structure. There is a similar characterization of left ﬁbrations:
a map p : X → S is a left ﬁbration if and only if X is a ﬁbrant object of (Set∆)/S with respect to certain
model structure, which we will refer to as the covariant model structure. We will deﬁne the covariant model
structure in §2.1.4, and give an overview of its basic properties.

2.1.1 Left Fibrations in Classical Category Theory

Before beginning our study of left ﬁbrations, let us recall a bit of classical category theory. Let D be a small
category, and suppose we are given a functor

χ : D → Gpd,

where Gpd denotes the category of groupoids (where the morphisms are given by functors). Using the functor
χ, we can extract a new category Cχ via the classical Grothendieck construction:

• The objects of Cχ are pairs (D, η), where D ∈ D and η is an object of the groupoid χ(D).

• Given a pair of objects (D, η), (D′, η′) ∈ Cχ, a morphism from (D, η) to (D′, η′) in Cχ is given by a pair
(f, α), where f : D → D′ is a morphism in D, and α : χ(f )(η) ≃ η′ is an isomorphism in the groupoid
χ(D′).

• Composition of morphisms is deﬁned in the obvious way.

There is an evident forgetful functor F : Cχ → D, which carries an object (D, η) ∈ Cχ to the underlying
object D ∈ D. Moreover, it is possible to reconstruct χ from the category Cχ (together with the forgetful
functor F ), at least up to equivalence; for example, if D is an object of D, then the groupoid χ(D) is
canonically equivalent to the ﬁber product Cχ ×D{D}. Consequently, the Grothendieck construction sets
up a dictionary which relates functors χ : D → Gpd with categories Cχ admitting a functor F : Cχ → D.
However, this dictionary is not perfect; not every functor F : C → D arises via the Grothendieck construction
described above. To clarify the situation, we recall the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 2.1.1.1. Let F : C → D be a functor between categories. We say that C is coﬁbered in groupoids
over D if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) For every object C ∈ C and every morphism η : F (C) → D in D, there exists a morphism

η : C →

D

such that F (

η) = η.

(2) For every morphism η : C → C′ in C and every object C′′ ∈ C, the map

e

HomC(C′, C′′) → HomC(C, C′′) ×HomD(F (C),F (C ′′)) HomD(F (C′), F (C′′))

e

e

is bijective.

54

Example 2.1.1.2. Let χ : D → Gpd be a functor from a category D to the category of groupoids. Then
the forgetful functor Cχ → D exhibits Cχ as ﬁbered in groupoids over D.

Example 2.1.1.2 admits a converse: suppose we begin with a category C ﬁbered in groupoids over D.
Then, for every every object D ∈ D, the ﬁber CD = C ×D{D} is a groupoid. Moreover, for every morphism
f : D → D′ in D, it is possible to construct a functor f! : CD → CD′ as follows: for each C ∈ CD, choose
a morphism f : C → C′ covering the map D → D′, and set f!(C) = C′. The map f may not be uniquely
determined, but it is unique up to isomorphism and depends functorially on C. Consequently, we obtain a
functor f!, which is well-deﬁned up to isomorphism. We can then try to deﬁne a functor χ : D → Gpd by
the formulas

D 7→ CD

f 7→ f!.

Unfortunately, this does not quite work: since the functor f! is determined only up to canonical isomorphism
by f , the identity (f ◦ g)! = f! ◦ g! holds only up to canonical isomorphism, rather than up to equality. This
is merely a technical inconvenience; it can be addressed in (at least) two ways:

• The groupoid χ(D) = C ×D{D} can be described as the category of functors G ﬁtting into a commu-

tative diagram

z

G
z

z

{D}

C

=z

F

/ D .

If we replace the one point category {D} with the overcategory DD/ in this deﬁnition, then we obtain
a groupoid equivalent to χ(D) which depends on D in a strictly functorial fashion.

• Without modifying the deﬁnition of χ(D), we can realize χ as a functor from D to an appropriate

bicategory of groupoids.

We may summarize the above discussion informally by saying that the Grothendieck construction estab-

lishes an equivalence between functors χ : D → Gpd and categories ﬁbered in groupoids over D.

The theory of left ﬁbrations should be regarded as an ∞-categorical generalization of Deﬁnition 2.1.1.1.

As a preliminary piece of evidence for this assertion, we oﬀer the following:

Proposition 2.1.1.3. Let F : C → D be a functor between categories. Then C is coﬁbered in groupoids over
D if and only if the induced map N(F ) : N(C) → N(D) is a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

Proof. Proposition 1.1.2.2 implies that N(F ) is an inner ﬁbration. It follows that N(F ) is a left ﬁbration if
and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to Λn
0 ⊆ ∆n for all n > 0. When n = 1, the relevant
lifting property is equivalent to (1) of Deﬁnition 2.1.1.1. When n = 2 (n = 3) the relevant lifting property
is equivalent to the surjectivity (injectivity) of the map described in (2). For n > 3, the relevant lifting
0 → S extends uniquely to ∆n when S is isomorphic to the nerve of a
property is automatic (since a map Λn
category).

Let us now consider the structure of a general left ﬁbration p : X → S. In the case where S consists of
a single vertex, Proposition 1.2.5.1 asserts that p is a left ﬁbration if and only if X is a Kan complex. Since
the class of left ﬁbrations is stable under pullback, we deduce that for any left ﬁbration p : X → S and
any vertex s of S, the ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s} is a Kan complex (which we can think of as the ∞-categorical
analogue of a groupoid). Moreover, these Kan complexes are related to one another. More precisely, suppose
that f : s → s′ is an edge of the simplicial set S and consider the inclusion i : Xs ≃ Xs × {0} ⊆ Xs × ∆1.

Restricting the dotted arrow to {1} × Xs, we obtain a map f! : Xs → Xs′ . Of course, f! is not unique, but
it is uniquely determined up to homotopy.

Lemma 2.1.1.4. Let q : X → S be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. The assignment

s ∈ S0 7→ Xs

f ∈ S1 7→ f!

determines a (covariant) functor from the homotopy category hS into the homotopy category H of spaces.

Proof. Let f : s → s′ be an edge of S. We note the following characterization of the morphism f! in H. Let K
be any simplicial set, and suppose given homotopy classes of maps η ∈ HomH(K, Xs), η′ ∈ HomH(K, Xs′ ).
Then η′ = f! ◦ η if and only if there exists a map p : K × ∆1 → X such that q ◦ p is given by the composition

η is the homotopy class of p|K × {0}, and η′ is the homotopy class of p|K × {1}.

Now consider any 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → S, which we will depict as

K × ∆1 → ∆1 f

→ S,

We note that the inclusion Xu × {0} ⊆ Xu × ∆2 is left-anodyne (Corollary 2.1.2.7). Consequently there
exists a map p : Xu × ∆2 → X such that p|Xu × {0} is the inclusion Xu ⊆ X and q ◦ p is the composition
Xu × ∆2 → ∆2 σ→ S. Then f! ≃ p|Xu × {1}, h! = p|Xu × {2}, and the map p|Xu × ∆{1,2} veriﬁes the
equation

h! = g! ◦ f!

in HomH(Xu, Xw).

We can summarize the situation informally as follows. Fix a simplicial set S. To give a left ﬁbration
q : X → S, one must specify a Kan complex Xs for each “object” of S, a map f! : Xs → Xs′ for each
“morphism” f : s → s′ of S, and “coherence data” for these morphisms for each higher-dimensional simplex
of S. In other words, giving a left ﬁbration ought to be more or less the same thing as giving a functor from
S to the ∞-category S of spaces. Lemma 2.1.1.4 can be regarded as a weak version of this assertion; we will
prove something considerably more precise in §2.1.4 (see Theorem 2.2.1.2).

We close this section by establishing two simple properties of left ﬁbrations, which will be needed in the

proof of Proposition 1.2.4.3:

Proposition 2.1.1.5. Let p : C → D be a left ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let f : X → Y be a morphism
in C such that p(f ) is an equivalence in D. Then f is an equivalence in C.

in C. It follows that g ◦ f ≃ idX , so that f admits a left homotopy inverse. Since p(g) = g is an equivalence in
D, the same argument proves that g has a left homotopy inverse. This left homotopy inverse must coincide
with f , since f is a right homotopy inverse to g. Thus f and g are homotopy inverse in the ∞-category C,
so that f is an equivalence as desired.

Proposition 2.1.1.6. Let p : C → D be a left ﬁbration of ∞-categories, let Y be an object of C, and let
f : X → p(Y ) be an equivalence in D. Then there exists a morphism f : X → Y in C such that p(f ) = f
(automatically an equivalence, in view of Proposition 2.1.1.5).

Proof. Let g : p(Y ) → X be a homotopy inverse to f in C. Since p is a left ﬁbration, there exists a morphism
g : Y → X such that g = p(g). Since f and g are homotopy inverse to one another, there exists a 2-simplex
of D which we can depict as follows:

2.1.2 Stability Properties of Left Fibrations

The purpose of this section is to show that left ﬁbrations of simplicial sets exist in abundance. Our main
results are Proposition 2.1.2.1 (which is our basic source of examples for left ﬁbrations) and Corollary 2.1.2.9
(which asserts that left ﬁbrations are stable under the formation of functor categories).

Let C be an ∞-category, and let S denote the ∞-category of spaces. One can think of a functor from C
to S as a “cosheaf of spaces” on C. By analogy with ordinary category theory, one might expect that the
basic example of such a cosheaf would be the cosheaf corepresented by an object C of C; roughly speaking
this should be given by the functor

D 7→ MapC(C, D).

As we saw in §2.1.1, it is natural to guess that such a functor can be encoded by a left ﬁbration
There is a natural candidate for

C: the undercategory CC/. Note that the ﬁber of the map

e

f : CC/ → C

C → C.

e

over the object D ∈ C is the Kan complex HomL
consequence of the following more general result:

C(C, D). The assertion that f is a left ﬁbration is a

Proposition 2.1.2.1 (Joyal). Suppose given a diagram of simplicial sets

K0 ⊆ K

p
→ X

q
→ S

where q is an inner ﬁbration. Let r = q ◦ p : K → S, p0 = p|K0, and r0 = r|K0. Then the induced map

is a left ﬁbration. If the map q is already a left ﬁbration, then the induced map

Xp/ → Xp0/ ×Sr0/ Sr/

is a left ﬁbration as well.

X/p → X/p0 ×S/r0

S/r

Proposition 2.1.2.1 immediately implies the following half of Proposition 1.2.9.3, which we asserted earlier

without proof:

Corollary 2.1.2.2 (Joyal). Let C be an ∞-category and p : K → C an arbitrary diagram. Then the
projection Cp/ → C is a left ﬁbration. In particular, Cp/ is itself an ∞-category.

Proof. Apply Proposition 2.1.2.1 in the case where X = C, S = ∗, A = ∅, B = K.

We can also use Proposition 2.1.2.1 to prove Proposition 1.2.4.3, which was stated without proof in §1.2.4.

Proposition. Let C be an ∞-category, and φ : ∆1 → C a morphism of C. Then φ is an equivalence if and
only if, for every n ≥ 2 and every map f0 : Λn
0 → C such that f0|∆{0,1} = φ, there exists an extension of f0
to ∆n.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that φ is an equivalence, and let f0 be as above. To ﬁnd the desired extension of f0, we
must produce the dotted arrow in the associated diagram

{0}(cid:127)

∆1

/ C/∆n−2

C/ ∂ ∆n−2 .

The projection map p : C/ ∂ ∆n−2 → C is a right ﬁbration (Proposition 2.1.2.1). Since φ′ is a preimage of
φ under p, Proposition 2.1.1.5 implies that φ′ is an equivalence. Because q is a right ﬁbration (Proposition
2.1.2.1 again), the existence of the dotted arrow follows from Proposition 2.1.1.6.

We now prove the converse. Let φ : X → Y be a morphism in C, and consider the map Λ2

0 → C indicated

in the following diagram:

The assumed extension property ensures the existence of the dotted morphism ψ : Y → X and a 2-simplex
σ which veriﬁes the identity ψ ◦ φ ≃ idX . We now consider the map

τ0 : Λ3
0

(•,s0φ,s1ψ,σ)

−→ C .

Once again, our assumption allows us to extend τ0 to a 3-simplex τ : ∆3 → C, and the face d0τ veriﬁes the
identity φ ◦ ψ = idY . It follows that ψ is a homotopy inverse to φ, so that φ is an equivalence in C.

We now turn to the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.1. It is an easy consequence of the following more basic

observation:

Lemma 2.1.2.3 (Joyal [44]). Let f : A0 ⊆ A and g : B0 ⊆ B be inclusions of simplicial sets. Suppose either
that f is right anodyne, or that g is left anodyne. Then the induced inclusion

is inner anodyne.

h : (A0 ⋆ B)

(A ⋆ B0) ⊆ A ⋆ B

aA0⋆B0

Proof. We will prove that h is inner anodyne whenever f is right anodyne; the other assertion follows by a
dual argument.

Consider the class of all morphisms f for which the conclusion of the lemma holds (for any inclusion
g). This class of morphisms is weakly saturated; to prove that it contains all right-anodyne morphisms, it
suﬃces to show that it contains each of the inclusions f : Λn
j ⊆ ∆n for 0 < j ≤ n. We may therefore assume
that f is of this form.

Now consider the collection of all inclusions g for which h is inner anodyne (where f is now ﬁxed). This
class of morphisms is also weakly saturated; to prove that it contains all inclusions, it suﬃces to show that
the lemma holds when g is of the form ∂ ∆m ⊆ ∆m. In this case, h can be identiﬁed with the inclusion
Λn+m+1

⊆ ∆n+m+1, which is inner anodyne because 0 < j ≤ n < n + m + 1.

j

The following result can be proven by exactly the same argument:

Lemma 2.1.2.4 (Joyal). Let f : A0 → A and g : B0 → B be inclusions of simplicial sets. Suppose that f
is left anodyne. Then the induced inclusion

is left anodyne.

(A0 ⋆ B)

(A ⋆ B0) ⊆ A ⋆ B

aA0⋆B0

Proof of Proposition 2.1.2.1. After unwinding the deﬁnitions, the ﬁrst assertion follows from Lemma 2.1.2.3
and the second from Lemma 2.1.2.4.

For future reference, we record the following counterpart to Proposition 2.1.2.1:

Proposition 2.1.2.5 (Joyal). Let π : S → T be an inner ﬁbration, p : B → S a map of simplicial sets,
i : A ⊆ B an inclusion of simplicial sets, p0 = p|A, p′ = π ◦ p, and p′
0 = π ◦ p0 = p′|A. Suppose that either i
is right anodyne, or π is a left ﬁbration. Then the induced map

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration.

φ : Sp/ → Sp0/ ×Tp′

0/ Tp′/

59

Proof. Consider the class of all coﬁbrations i : A → B for which φ is a trivial ﬁbration for every inner ﬁbration
(right ﬁbration) p : S → T . It is not diﬃcult to see that this is a weakly saturated class of morphisms; thus,
it suﬃces to consider the case where A = Λm

i , B = ∆m, for 0 < i ≤ m (0 ≤ i ≤ m).

Let q : ∂ ∆n → Sp/ be a map, and suppose given an extension of φ◦q to ∆n. We wish to ﬁnd a compatible

extension of q. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we are given a map

r : (∆m ⋆ ∂ ∆n)

(Λm

i ⋆ ∆n) → S

aΛm
i ⋆∂ ∆n
which we wish to extend to ∆m ⋆ ∆n in a manner that is compatible with a given extension ∆m ⋆ ∆n → T
of the composite map π ◦ r. The existence of such an extension follows immediately from the assumption
that p has the right lifting property with respect to the horn inclusion Λn+m+1

⊆ ∆n+m+1.

i

The remainder of this section is devoted to the study of the behavior of left ﬁbrations under exponenti-
ation. Our goal is to prove an assertion of the following form: if p : X → S is a left ﬁbration of simplicial
sets, then so is the induced map X K → SK, for every simplicial set K (this is a special case of Corollary
2.1.2.9 below). This is an easy consequence of the following characterization of left anodyne maps, which is
due to Joyal:

Proposition 2.1.2.6 (Joyal [44]). The following collections of morphisms generate the same weakly saturated
class of morphisms of Set∆:

(1) The collection A1 of all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, 0 ≤ i < n.

(2) The collection A2 of all inclusions

(∆m × {0})

(∂ ∆m × ∆1) ⊆ ∆m × ∆1.

a∂ ∆m×{0}

(3) The collection A3 of all inclusions

(S′ × {0})

(S × ∆1) ⊆ S′ × ∆1,

aS×{0}

where S ⊆ S′.

Proof. Let S ⊆ S′ be as in (3). Working cell-by-cell on S′, we deduce that every morphism in A3 can be
obtained as an iterated pushout of morphisms belonging to A2. Conversely, A2 is contained in A3, which
proves that they generate the same weakly saturated collection of morphisms.

To proceed with the proof, we must ﬁrst introduce a bit of notation. The (n + 1)-simplices of ∆n × ∆1

are indexed by order-preserving maps

We let σk denote the map

[n + 1] → [0, . . . , n] × [0, 1].

σk(m) =

(m, 0)
(m − 1, 1)

(

if m ≤ k
if m > k.

We will also denote by σk the corresponding (n + 1)-simplex of ∆n × ∆1. We note that {σk}0≤k≤n are
precisely the nondegenerate (n + 1)-simplices of ∆n × ∆1.

We deﬁne a collection {X(k)}0≤k≤n+1 of simplicial subsets of ∆n × ∆1 by descending induction on k.

We begin by setting

X(n + 1) = (∆n × {0})

(∂ ∆n × ∆1).

a∂ ∆n×{0}

60

Assuming that X(k + 1) has been deﬁned, we let X(k) ⊆ ∆n × ∆1 be the union of X(k + 1) and the simplex
σk (together with all the faces of σk). We note that this description exhibits X(k) as a pushout

X(k + 1)

∆n+1,

aΛn+1

k

and also that X(0) = ∆n × ∆1. It follows that each step in the chain of inclusions

X(n + 1) ⊆ X(n) ⊆ . . . ⊆ X(1) ⊆ X(0)

is contained in the class of morphisms generated by A1, so that the inclusion X(n + 1) ⊆ X(0) is generated
by A1.

To complete the proof, we show that each inclusion in A1 is a retract of an inclusion in A3. More

speciﬁcally, the inclusion Λn

i ⊆ ∆n is a retract of

(∆n × {0})

(Λn

i × ∆1) ⊆ ∆n × ∆1,

aΛn
i ×{0}

so long as 0 ≤ i < n. We will deﬁne the relevant maps

∆n j

→ ∆n × ∆1 r→ ∆n

and leave it to the reader to verify that they are compatible with the relevant subobjects. The map j is
simply the inclusion ∆n ≃ ∆n × {1} ⊆ ∆n × ∆1. The map r is induced by a map of partially ordered sets,
which we will also denote by r. It may be described by the formulae

r(m, 0) =

m if m 6= i + 1
if m = i + 1
i

(

r(m, 1) = m.

Corollary 2.1.2.7. Let i : A → A′ be left-anodyne, and let j : B → B′ be a coﬁbration. Then the induced
map

is left-anodyne.

(A × B′)

(A′ × B) → A′ × B′

aA×B

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.3.2.1, which characterizes the class of left-anodyne maps
as the class generated by A3 (which is stable under smash products with any coﬁbration).

Remark 2.1.2.8. A basic fact in the homotopy theory of simplicial sets is that the analogue of Corollary
2.1.2.7 holds also for the class of anodyne maps of simplicial sets. Since the class of anodyne maps is generated
(as a weakly saturated class of morphisms) by the class of left anodyne maps and the class of right anodyne
maps, this classical fact follows from Corollary 2.1.2.7 (together with the dual assertion concerning right
anodyne maps).

Corollary 2.1.2.9. Let p : X → S be a left-ﬁbration, and let i : A → B be any coﬁbration of simplicial sets.
Then the induced map q : X B → X A ×SA SB is a left ﬁbration. If i is left anodyne, then q is a trivial Kan
ﬁbration.

61

Corollary 2.1.2.10 (Homotopy Extension Lifting Property). Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets.
Then p is a left ﬁbration if and only if the induced map

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

X ∆1

→ X {0} ×S{0} S∆1

For future use, we record the following criterion for establishing that a morphism is left anodyne:

Proposition 2.1.2.11. Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets, let s : S → X be a section of p, and let
h ∈ HomS(X × ∆1, X) be a (ﬁberwise) simplicial homotopy from s ◦ p = h|X × {0} to idX = h|X × {1}.
Then s is left anodyne.

Proof. Consider a diagram

where q is a left ﬁbration. We must show that it is possible to ﬁnd a map f rendering the diagram commu-
tative. Deﬁne F0 : (S × ∆1)
S×{0}(X × {0}) to be the composition of g with the projection onto S. Now
consider the diagram

Since q is a left ﬁbration and the left vertical map is left anodyne, it is possible to supply the dotted arrow
F as indicated. Now we observe that f = F |X × {1} has the desired properties.

2.1.3 A Characterization of Kan Fibrations

Let p : X → S be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. As we saw in §2.1.1, p determines for each vertex s of S a
Kan complex Xs, and for each edge f : s → s′ a map of Kan complexes f! : Xs → Xs′ (which is well-deﬁned
up to homotopy). If p is a Kan ﬁbration, then the same argument allows us to construct a map Xs′ → Xs,
which is a homotopy inverse to f!. Our goal in this section is to prove the following converse:

Proposition 2.1.3.1. Let p : S → T be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The map p is a Kan ﬁbration.

(2) For every edge f : t → t′ in T , the map f! : St → St′ is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H

of spaces.

Lemma 2.1.3.2. Let p : S → T be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Suppose that S and T are Kan
complexes, and that p is a homotopy equivalence. Then p induces a surjection from S0 to T0.

Proof. Fix a vertex t ∈ T0. Since p is a homotopy equivalence, there exists a vertex s ∈ S0 and an edge e
joining p(s) to t. Since p is a left ﬁbration, this edge lifts to an edge e′ : s → s′ in S. Then p(s′) = t.

Lemma 2.1.3.3. Let p : S → T be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Suppose that T is a Kan complex.
Then p is a Kan ﬁbration.

Proof. We note that the projection S → ∗, being a composition of left ﬁbrations S → T and T → ∗, is a left
ﬁbration, so that S is also a Kan complex. Let A ⊆ B be an anodyne inclusion of simplicial sets. We must
show that the map p : SB → SA ×T A T B is surjective on vertices. Since S and T are Kan complexes, the
maps T B → T A and SB → SA are trivial ﬁbrations. It follows that p is a homotopy equivalence and a left
ﬁbration. Now we simply apply Lemma 2.1.3.2.

Lemma 2.1.3.4. Let p : S → T be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Suppose that for every vertex t ∈ T ,
the ﬁber St is contractible. Then p is a trivial Kan ﬁbration.

Proof. It will suﬃce to prove the analogous result for right ﬁbrations (we do this in order to keep the notation
we use below consistent with that employed in the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6).

Since p has nonempty ﬁbers, it has the right lifting property with respect to the inclusion ∅ = ∂ ∆0 ⊆ ∆0.
Let n > 0, f : ∂ ∆n → S any map, and g : ∆n → T an extension of p ◦ f . We must show that there exists
an extension

f : ∆n → S with g = p ◦

f .

Pulling back via the map G, we may suppose that T = ∆n and g is the identity map, so that S is an
∞-category. Let t denote the initial vertex of T . There is a unique map g′ : ∆n × ∆1 → T such that
g′|∆n × {1} = g and g′|∆n × {0} is constant at the vertex t.

e

Since the inclusion ∂ ∆n × {1} ⊆ ∂ ∆n × ∆1 is right anodyne, there exists an extension f ′ of f to
∂ ∆n × ∆1 which covers g′| ∂ ∆n × ∆1. To complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that we can extend f ′ to
f ′ : ∆n × ∆1 → S (such an extension is automatically compatible with g′ in view of our assumptions
a map
that T = ∆n and n > 0). Assuming this has been done, we simply deﬁne

f ′|∆n × {1}.

f =

Recall the notation of the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6, and ﬁlter the simplicial set ∆n × ∆1 by the

e
simplicial subsets

e

e

X(n + 1) ⊆ . . . ⊆ X(0) = ∆n × ∆1.
We extend the deﬁnition of f ′ to X(m) by a descending induction on m. When m = n + 1, we note that
X(n + 1) is obtained from ∂ ∆n × ∆1 by adjoining the interior of the simplex ∂ ∆n × {0}. Since the boundary
of this simplex maps entirely into the contractible Kan complex St, it is possible to extend f ′ to X(n + 1).
Now suppose the deﬁnition of f ′ has been extended to X(i + 1). We note that X(i) is obtained from
X(i + 1) by pushout along a horn inclusion Λn+1
⊆ ∆n+1.
If i > 0, then the assumption that S is an
∞-category guarantees the existence of an extension of f ′ to X(i). When i = 0, we note that f ′ carries
the initial edge of σ0 into the ﬁber St. Since St is a Kan complex, f ′ carries the initial edge of σ0 to an
equivalence in S, and the desired extension of f ′ exists by Proposition 1.2.4.3.

i

Proof of Proposition 2.1.3.1. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed, and let f : t → t′ be an edge in T . Since
p is a right ﬁbration, the edge f induces a map f ∗ : St′ → St, which is well-deﬁned up to homotopy. It is
not diﬃcult to check that the maps f ∗ and f! are homotopy inverse to one another; in particular, f! is a
homotopy equivalence. This proves that (1) ⇒ (2).

Assume now that (2) is satisﬁed. A map of simplicial sets is a Kan ﬁbration if and only if it is both a
right ﬁbration and a left ﬁbration; consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that p is a right ﬁbration. According
to Corollary 2.1.2.10, it will suﬃce to show that
q : S∆1

→ S{1} ×T {1} T ∆1

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. Corollary 2.1.2.9 implies that q is a left ﬁbration. By Lemma 2.1.3.4, it suﬃces to
show that the ﬁbers of q are contractible.

Fix an edge f : t → t′ in T . Let X denote the simplicial set of sections of the projection S ×T ∆1 → ∆1,
where ∆1 maps into T via the edge f . Consider the ﬁber q′ : X → St′ of q over the edge f . Since the q and
q′ have the same ﬁbers (over points of S{1} ×T {1} T ∆1
whose second projection is the edge f ), it will suﬃce
to show that q′ is a trivial ﬁbration for every choice of f .

Consider the projection r : X → St. Since p is a left ﬁbration, r is a trivial ﬁbration. Because St is
a Kan complex, so is X. Lemma 2.1.3.3 implies that q′ is a Kan ﬁbration. We note that f! is obtained
by choosing a section of r and then composing with q′. Consequently, assumption (2) implies that q′ is a
homotopy equivalence, and thus a trivial ﬁbration, which completes the proof.

63

Remark 2.1.3.5. Lemma 2.1.3.4 is an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.1.3.1, since any map between
contractible Kan complexes is a homotopy equivalence. Lemma 2.1.3.3 also follows immediately, since if T
is a Kan complex, then its homotopy category is a groupoid, so that any functor hT → H carries edges of
T to invertible morphisms in H.

2.1.4 The Covariant Model Structure

In §2.1.2, we saw that a left ﬁbration p : X → S determines a functor χ from hS to the homotopy category
H, carrying each vertex s to the ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s}. We would like to formulate a more precise relationship
between left ﬁbrations over S and functors from S into spaces. For this, it is convenient to employ Quillen’s
language of model categories. In this section, we will show that the category (Set∆)/S can be endowed with
the structure of a simplicial model category, whose ﬁbrant objects are precisely the left ﬁbrations X → S.
In §2.2, we will give an ∞-categorical version of the Grothendieck construction, provided by a suitable right
Quillen functor

(Set∆)C[S] → (Set∆)/S

which we will prove to be a Quillen equivalence (Theorem 2.2.1.2).

Warning 2.1.4.1. We will assume throughout this section that the reader is familiar with the theory of
model categories, as presented in §A.2. We will also assume familiarity with the model structure on the
category Cat∆ of simplicial categories (see §A.3.2).

`

Deﬁnition 2.1.4.2. Let f : X → S be a map of simplicial sets. The left cone of f is the simplicial set
X X ⊳. We will denote the left cone of f by C⊳(f ). Dually, we deﬁne the right cone of f to be the
S
simplicial set C⊳(f ) = S

X X ⊳.

Remark 2.1.4.3. Let f : X → S be a map of simplicial sets. There is a canonical monomorphism of
simplicial sets S → C⊳(f ). We will generally identify S with its image under this monomorphism, and
thereby regard S as a simplicial subset of C⊳(f ). We note that there is a unique vertex of C⊳(f ) which does
not belong to S. We will refer to this vertex as the cone point of C⊳(f ).

`

Example 2.1.4.4. Let S be a simplicial set, and let idS denote the identity map from S to itself. Then
C⊳(idS) and C⊲(idS) can be identiﬁed with S⊳ and S⊲, respectively.
Deﬁnition 2.1.4.5. Let S be a simplicial set. We will say that a map f : X → Y in (Set∆)/S is a:

(C) covariant coﬁbration if it is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

(W ) covariant equivalence if the induced map

is a categorical equivalence.

X ⊳

S → Y ⊳

S

aX

aY

(F ) covariant ﬁbration if it has the right lifting property with respect to every map which is both a covariant

coﬁbration and a covariant equivalence.

Lemma 2.1.4.6. Let S be a simplicial set. Then every left anodyne map in (Set∆)/S is a covariant equiv-
alence.

Proof. By general nonsense, it suﬃces to prove the result for a generating left anodyne inclusion of the form
Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, where 0 ≤ i < n. In other words, we must show any map

i : (Λn

i )⊳

S → (∆n)⊳

S

aΛn

is a categorical equivalence. We now observe that i is a pushout of the inner anodyne inclusion Λn+1
∆n+1.

Proposition 2.1.4.7. Let S be a simplicial set. The covariant coﬁbrations, covariant equivalences, and
covariant ﬁbrations determine a left proper, combinatorial model structure on (Set∆)/S.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that conditions (1), (2), and (3) of Proposition A.2.6.13 are met. We consider each
in turn:

(1) The class (W ) of weak equivalences is perfect. This follows from Corollary A.2.6.12, since the functor

X 7→ X ⊳

X S commutes with ﬁltered colimits.

(2) It is clear that the class (C) of coﬁbrations is generated by a set. We must show that weak equivalences
are stable under pushouts by coﬁbrations. In other words, suppose we are given a pushout diagram

which is homotopy coCartesian, since Cat∆ is a left proper model category. Since the upper horizontal
map is an equivalence, so it the bottom horizontal map; thus j′ is a covariant equivalence.

`

X S] and C[Y ⊳

(3) We must show that a map p : X → Y in Set∆, which has the right lifting property with respect to
every map in (C), belongs to (W ). We note in that case that p is a trivial Kan ﬁbration, and therefore
admits a section s : Y → X. We will show that p and s induce mutually inverse isomorphisms between
C[X ⊳
Y S] in the homotopy category hCat∆; it will then follow that p is a covariant
equivalence.
`
Let f : X → X denote the composition s ◦ p; we wish to show that the map C[X ⊳
X S] induced by
f is equivalent to the identity in hCat∆. We observe that f is homotopic to the identity idX via a
homotopy h : ∆1 × X → X. It will therefore suﬃce to show that h is a covariant equivalence. But h
admits a left inverse

`

`

which is left anodyne (Corollary 2.1.2.7) and therefore a covariant equivalence by Lemma 2.1.4.6.

X ≃ {0} × X ⊆ ∆1 × X

Proposition 2.1.4.8. The category (Set∆)/S is a simplicial model category (with respect to the covariant
model structure and the natural simplicial structure).

Proof. We will deduce this from Proposition A.3.1.7. The only nontrivial point is to verify that for any
X ∈ (Set∆)/S, the projection X × ∆n → X is a covariant equivalence. But this map has a section X × {0} →
X × ∆n, which is left anodyne and therefore a covariant equivalence (Proposition 2.1.4.9).

We will refer to the model structure of Proposition 2.1.4.7 as the covariant model structure on (Set∆)/S.
We will prove later that the covariantly ﬁbrant objects of (Set∆)/S are precisely the left ﬁbrations X → S
(Corollary 2.2.3.12). For the time being, we will be content to make a much weaker observation:

Proposition 2.1.4.9. Let S be a simplicial set.

(1) Every left anodyne map in (Set∆)/S is a trivial coﬁbration with respect to the covariant model structure.

(2) Every covariant ﬁbration in (Set∆)/S is a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

(3) Every ﬁbrant object of (Set∆)/S determines a left ﬁbration X → S.

Proof. Assertion (1) follows from Lemma 2.1.4.6, and the implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) are obvious.

Our next result expresses the idea that the covariant model structure on (Set∆)/S depends functorially

on S:

Proposition 2.1.4.10. Let j : S → S′ be a map of simplicial sets. Let j! : (Set∆)/S → (Set∆)/S′ be the
forgetful functor (given by composition with j), and let j∗ : (Set∆)/S′ → (Set∆)/S be its right adjoint, which
is given by the formula

Then we have a Quillen adjunction

j∗X ′ = X ′ ×S′ S.

(Set∆)/S

j!

j∗

/ (Set∆)/S′

(with the covariant model structures).

Proof. It is clear that j! preserves coﬁbrations. For X ∈ (Set∆)S, the pushout diagram

S

X S

/ X ⊳

X S′

`
is a homotopy pushout (with respect to the Joyal model structure). Thus j! preserves covariant equivalences.
It follows that (j!, j∗) is a Quillen adjunction.

`

Remark 2.1.4.11. Let j : S → S′ be as in Proposition 2.1.4.10. If j is a categorical equivalence, then the
Quillen adjunction (j!, j∗) is a categorical equivalence. This follows from Theorem 2.2.1.2 and Proposition
A.3.3.8.

Remark 2.1.4.12. Let S be a simplicial set. The covariant model structure on (Set∆)/S is usually not
self-dual. Consequently, we may deﬁne a new model structure on (Set∆)/S as follows:

(C) A map f in (Set∆)/S is a contravariant coﬁbration if it is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

(W ) A map f in (Set∆)/S is a contravariant equivalence if f op is a covariant equivalence in (Set∆)/Sop.

(F ) A map f in (Set∆)/S is a contravariant ﬁbration if f op is a covariant ﬁbration in (Set∆)/Sop.

We will refer to this model structure on (Set∆)/S as the contravariant model structure. Propositions 2.1.4.8,
2.1.4.9 and 2.1.4.10 have evident analogues in the contravariant setting.

2.2 Simplicial Categories and ∞-Categories

For every topological category C and every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, Theorem 1.1.5.13 asserts that the counit
map

u : | MapC[N(C)](X, Y )| → MapC(X, Y )

is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces. This result is the main ingredient needed to establish
the equivalence between the theory of topological categories and the theory of ∞-categories. The goal of
this section is to give a proof of Theorem 1.1.5.13 and to develop some of its consequences.

We ﬁrst replace Theorem 1.1.5.13 by a statement about simplicial categories. Consider the composition

MapC[N(C)](X, Y ) v→ Sing Map| C[N(C)]|(X, Y )

Sing(u)

→ Sing MapC(X, Y ).

Classical homotopy theory ensures that v is a weak homotopy equivalence. Moreover, u is a weak homotopy
equivalence of topological spaces if and only if Sing(u) is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.
Consequently, u is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces if and only if Sing(u) ◦ v is a weak
homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets. It will therefore suﬃce to prove the following simplicial analogue of
Theorem 1.1.5.13:

Theorem 2.2.0.1. Let C be a ﬁbrant simplicial category (that is, a simplicial category in which each mapping
space MapC(x, y) is a Kan complex), and let x, y ∈ C be a pair of objects. The counit map

u : MapC[N(C)](x, y) → MapC(x, y)

is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

The proof will be given in §2.2.4 (see Proposition 2.2.4.1). Our strategy is as follows:

(1) We will show that, for every simplicial set S, there is a close relationship between right ﬁbrations S′ → S
and simplicial presheaves F : C[S]op → Set∆. This relationship is controlled by the straightening and
unstraightening functors which we introduce in §2.2.1.

(2) Suppose that S is an ∞-category. Then, for each object y ∈ S, the projection S/y → S is a right
ﬁbration, which corresponds to a simplicial presheaf F : C[S]op → Set∆. This simplicial presheaf F is
related to S/y in two diﬀerent ways:

(i) As a simplicial presheaf, F is weakly equivalent to the functor x 7→ MapC[S](x, y).
(ii) For each object x of S, there is a canonical homotopy equivalence F(x) → S/y ×S {x} ≃

HomR

S (x, y). Here the Kan complex HomR

S (x, y) is deﬁned as in §1.2.2.

(3) Combining observations (i) and (ii), we will conclude that the mapping spaces HomR

S (x, y) are homo-

topy equivalent to the correpsonding mapping spaces HomC[S](x, y).

(4) In the special case where S is the nerve of a ﬁbrant simplicial category C, there is a canonical map

HomC(x, y) → HomR

S (x, y), which we will show to be a homotopy equivalence in §2.2.2.

(5) Combining (3) and (4), we will obtain a canonical isomorphism MapC(x, y) ≃ MapC[N(C)](x, y) in the
homotopy category of spaces. We will then show that this isomorphism is induced by the unit map
appearing in the statement of Theorem 2.2.0.1.

We will conclude this section with §2.2.5, where we apply Theorem 2.2.0.1 to construct the Joyal model
structure on Set∆ and to establish a more reﬁned version of the equivalence between ∞-categories and
simplicial categories.

67

2.2.1 The Straightening and Unstraightening Constructions (Unmarked Case)

In §2.1.1, we asserted that a left ﬁbration X → S can be viewed as a functor from S into a suitable ∞-
category of Kan complexes. Our goal in this section is to make this idea precise. For technical reasons, it will
be somewhat more convenient to phrase our results in terms of the dual theory of right ﬁbrations X → S.
Given any functor φ : C[S]op → C between simplicial categories, we will deﬁne an unstraightening functor
U nφ : SetC
∆ → (Set∆)/S. If F : C → Set∆ is a diagram taking values in Kan complexes, then the associated
map U nφ F → S is a right ﬁbration, whose ﬁber at a point s ∈ S is homotopy equivalent to the Kan complex
F(φ(s)).

Fix a simplicial set S, a simplicial category C and a functor φ : C[S] → Cop. Given an object X ∈ (Set∆)/S,

let v denote the cone point of X ⊲. We can view the simplicial category

M = C[X ⊲]

Cop

C[X]
a

as a correspondence from Cop to {v}, which we can identify with a simplicial functor

This functor is described by the formula

StφX : C → Set∆ .

(StφX)(C) = MapM(C, v).

We may regard Stφ as a functor from (Set∆)/S to (Set∆)C. We refer to Stφ as the straightening functor
associated to φ. In the special case where C = C[S]op and φ is the identity map, we will write StS instead
of Stφ.

By the adjoint functor theorem (or by direct construction), the straightening functor Stφ associated to
φ : C[S] → Cop has a right adjoint, which we will denote by U nφ and refer to as the unstraightening functor.
We now record the obvious functoriality properties of this construction.

Proposition 2.2.1.1.

(1) Let p : S′ → S be a map of simplicial sets, C a simplicial category, and φ :
C[S] → Cop a simplicial functor, and let φ′
: C[S′] → Cop denote the composition φ ◦ C[p]. Let
p! : (Set∆)/S′ → (Set∆)/S denote the forgetful functor, given by composition with p. There is a natural
isomorphism of functors

Stφ ◦ p! ≃ Stφ′

from (Set∆)/S′ to SetC
∆.

(2) Let S be a simplicial set, π : C → C′ a simplicial functor between simplicial categories, and φ : C[S] →

Cop a simplicial functor. Then there is a natural isomorphism of functors

Stπop◦φ ≃ π! ◦ Stφ

from (Set∆)/S to SetC′
given by composition with π.

∆ . Here π! : SetC

Our main result is the following:

Proof. It is easy to see that Stφ preserves coﬁbrations and weak equivalences, so that the pair (Stφ, U nφ)
is a Quillen adjunction. The real content of Theorem 2.2.1.2 is the ﬁnal assertion. Suppose that φ is an
equivalence of simplicial categories; then we wish to show that (Stφ, U nφ) is a Quillen equivalence. We will
prove this result in §2.2.3 as a consequence of Proposition 2.2.3.11.

2.2.2 Straightening Over a Point

In this section, we will study behavior of the straightening functor StX in the case where the simplicial set
X = {x} consists of a single vertex. In this case, we can view StX as a colimit-preserving functor from the
category of simplicial sets to itself. We begin with a few general remarks about such functors.

Let ∆ denote the category of combinatorial simplices and Set∆ the category of simplicial sets, so that
Set∆ may be identiﬁed with the category of presheaves of sets on ∆. If C is any category which admits small
colimits, then any functor f : ∆ → C extends to a colimit-preserving functor F : Set∆ → C (which is unique
up to unique isomorphism). We may regard f as a cosimplicial object C• of C. In this case, we shall denote
the functor F by

S 7→ |S|C •.

Remark 2.2.2.1. Concretely, one constructs |S|C • by taking the disjoint union of Sn × Cn and making
the appropriate identiﬁcations along the “boundaries”. In the language of category theory, the geometric
realization is given by the coend

Sn × Cn.

Z[n]∈∆

The functor S 7→ |S|C • has a right adjoint which we shall denote by SingC • . It may be described by the

formula

SingC •(X)n = HomC(Cn, X).

Example 2.2.2.2. Let C be the category CG of compactly generated Hausdorﬀ spaces, and let C• be the
cosimplicial space deﬁned by

Cn = {(x0, . . . , xn) ∈ [0, 1]n+1 : x0 + . . . + xn = 1}.

Then |S|C • is the usual geometric realization |S| of the simplicial set S and SingC • = Sing is the functor
which assigns to each topological space X its its singular complex.

Example 2.2.2.3. Let C be the category Set∆, and let C• be the standard simplex (the cosimplicial object
of Set∆ given by the Yoneda embedding):

Cn = ∆n.

Then ||C • and SingC • are both (isomorphic to) the identity functor on Set∆.

Example 2.2.2.4. Let C = Cat, and let f : ∆ → Cat be the functor which associates to each ﬁnite nonempty
linearly ordered set J the corresponding category. Then SingC • = N is the functor which associates to each
category its nerve, and ||C • associates, to each simplicial set S, the homotopy category hS as deﬁned in
§1.2.3.

Example 2.2.2.5. Let C = Cat∆, and let C• be the cosimplicial object of C given in Deﬁnitions 1.1.5.1 and
1.1.5.3. Then SingC • is the simplicial nerve functor, and ||C • is its left adjoint

S 7→ C[S].

69

Let us now return to the case of the straightening functor StX , where X = {x} consists of a single vertex.
The above remarks show that we can identify StX with the geometric realization functor ||Q• : Set∆ → Set∆,
for some cosimplicial object Q• in Set∆. To describe Q• more explicitly, let us ﬁrst deﬁne a cosimplicial
simplicial set J • by the formula

J n = (∆n ⋆ {y})

{x}.

The cosimplical simplicial set Q• can then be described by the formula Qn = MapC[J n](x, y).

In order to proceed with our analysis, we need to understand better the cosimplicial object Q• of Set∆.

a∆n

It admits the following description:

• For each n ≥ 0, let P[n] denote the partially ordered set of nonempty subsets of [n], and K[n] the
simplicial set N(P ) (which may be identiﬁed with a simplicial subset of the (n + 1)-cube (∆1)n+1).
The simplicial set Qn is obtained by collapsing, for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n, the subset

(∆1){j:0≤j<i} × {1} × (∆1){j:i<j≤n} ⊆ K[n]

to its quotient (∆1){j:i<j≤n}.

• A map f : [n] → [m] determines a map Pf : P[n] → P[m], by setting Pf (I) = f (I). The map Pf in turn
induces a map of simplicial sets K[n] → K[m], which determines a map of quotients Qn → Qm when f
is order-preserving.

Remark 2.2.2.6. Let Q• = |Q•| denote the cosimplicial space obtained by applying the (usual) geometric
realization functor to Q•. The space Qn may be described as a quotient of the cube of all functions p : [n] →
[0, 1] satisfying p(0) = 1. This cube is to be divided by the following equivalence relation: p ≃ p′ if there
exists a nonnegative integer i ≤ n such that p|{i, . . . n} = p′|{i, . . . , n} and p(i) = p′(i) = 1.

Each Qn is homeomorphic to an n-simplex, and these homeomorphisms may be chosen to be compatible
with the face maps of the cosimplicial space Q•. However, Q• is not isomorphic to the standard simplex
because it has very diﬀerent degeneracies. For example, the product of the degeneracy mappings Qn → (Q1)n
is not injective for n ≥ 2.

Our goal for the remainder of this section is to study the functors SingQ• and ||Q• and to prove that
they are “close” to the identity functor. More precisely, there is a map π : Q• → ∆• of cosimplicial objects
of Set∆. It is induced by a map K[n] → ∆n, which the nerve of the map of partially ordered sets P[n] → [n]
which carries each nonempty subset of [n] to its largest element.

Proposition 2.2.2.7. Let S be a simplicial set. Then the map pS : |S|Q• → S induced by π is a weak
homotopy equivalence.

Proof. Consider the collection A of simplicial sets S for which the assertion of Proposition 2.2.2.7 holds.
Since A is stable under ﬁltered colimits, it will suﬃce to prove that every simplicial set S having only ﬁnitely
many nondegenerate simplices belongs to A. We prove this by induction on the dimension n of S, and the
number of nondegenerate simplices of S of dimension n. If S = ∅, there is nothing to prove; otherwise we
may write

S ≃ S′

∆n

a∂ ∆n

|S|Q• ≃ |S′|Q•

|∆n|Q• .

a| ∂ ∆n|Q•

Since both of these pushouts are homotopy pushouts, it suﬃces to show that pS′, p∂ ∆n , and p∆n are weak
homotopy equivalences. For pS′ and p∂ ∆n, this follows from the inductive hypothesis; for p∆n, we need only
observe that both ∆n and |∆n|Q• = Qn are weakly contractible.

Remark 2.2.2.8. The strategy used to prove Proposition 2.2.2.7 will reappear frequently throughout this
book: it allows us to prove theorems about arbitrary simplicial sets by reducing to the case of simplices.

Proposition 2.2.2.9. The adjoint functors Set∆

determine a Quillen equivalence from the cat-

Proof. We ﬁrst show that the functors (||Q• , SingQ• ) determine a Quillen adjunction from Set∆ to itself. For
this, it suﬃces to prove that the functor S 7→ |S|Q• preserves coﬁbrations and weak equivalences. The case
of coﬁbrations is easy, and the second case follows from Proposition 2.2.2.7. To complete the proof, it will
suﬃce to show that the left derived functor L||Q• determines an equivalence from the homotopy category
H to itself. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.2.2.7, which implies that L||Q• is equivalent to the
identity functor.

Corollary 2.2.2.10. Let X be a Kan complex. Then the counit map

v : | SingQ• X|Q• → X

is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Remark 2.2.2.11. Let S be a simplicial set containing a vertex s. Let C be a simplicial category, φ :
C[S]op → C a simplicial functor, and C = φ(s) ∈ C. For every simplicial functor F : C → Set∆, there is a
canonical isomorphism

(U nφ F) ×S {s} ≃ SingQ• F(C).
In particular, we have a canonical map from F(C) to the ﬁber (U nφ F)s, which is a homotopy equivalence if
F(C) is ﬁbrant.
Remark 2.2.2.12. Let C and C′ be simplicial categories. Given a pair of simplicial functors F : C → Set∆,
F′ : C′ → Set∆, we let F ⊠ F′ : C × C′ → Set∆ denote the functor described by the formula

(F ⊠ F′)(C, C′) = F(C) × F′(C′).

Given a pair of simplicial functors φ : C[S]op → C, φ′ : C[S′]op → C′, we let φ ⊠ φ′ denote the induced map
C[S × S′] → C × C′. We observe that there is a canonical isomorphism of functors

Restricting our attention to the case where S′ = ∆0 and φ′ is an isomorphism, we obtain an isomorphism

U nφ⊠φ′(F ⊠ F′) ≃ U nφ(F) × U nφ′(F′).

for every simplicial set K. In particular, for every pair of functors F, G ∈ SetC

∆, we have a chain of maps

U nφ(F ⊠K) ≃ U nφ(F) × SingQ• K,

HomSet∆(K, MapSetC

(F, G)) ≃ HomSetC

(F ⊠K, G)
→ Hom(Set∆)/S (U nφ(F ⊠K), U nφ G)

→ Hom(Set∆)/S (U nφ(F) × K, U nφ G)
≃ HomSet∆(K, Map(Set∆)/S (U nφ(F), U nφ(G)).

This construction is natural in K, and therefore determines a map of simplicial sets

MapSetC

∆

(F, G) → Map(Set∆)/S (U nφ F, U nφ G).

Together, these maps endow the unstraightening functor U nφ with the structure of a simplicial functor from

The cosimplicial object Q• of Set∆ will play an important role in our proof of Theorem 1.1.5.13. To
explain this, let us suppose that C is a simplicial category and S = N(C) is its simplicial nerve. For every
pair of vertices x, y ∈ S, we can consider the right mapping space HomR
S (x, y). By deﬁnition, giving an
n-simplex of HomR
S (x, y) is equivalent to giving a map of simplicial sets J n → S, which carries x to x and y
to y. Using the identiﬁcation S ≃ N(C), we see that this is equivalent to giving a map C[J n] into C, which
again carries x to x and y to y. This is simply the data of a map of simplicial sets Qn → MapC(x, y).
Moreover, this identiﬁcation is natural with respect to [n]; we therefore have the following result:
Proposition 2.2.2.13. Let C be a simplicial category, and let X, Y ∈ C be two objects. There is a natural
isomorphism of simplicial sets HomR
N(C)(X, Y ) ≃ SingQ• MapC(X, Y ).

2.2.3 Straightening of Right Fibrations

Our goal in this section is to prove Theorem 2.2.1.2, which asserts that the Quillen adjunction

(Set∆)/S

Stφ

Unφ

/ SetC
∆

is a Quillen equivalence when φ : C[S] → Cop is an equivalence of simplicial categories. We ﬁrst treat the
case where S is a simplex.

Lemma 2.2.3.1. Let n be a nonnegative integer, let [n] denote the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , n}, regarded
as a (discrete) simplicial category, and let φ : C[∆n] → [n] be the canonical functor. Then the Quillen
adjunction

(Set∆)/∆n

Stφ

Unφ

/ Set∆

[n]

is a Quillen equivalence.

Proof. It follows from the deﬁnition of the contravariant model structure that the left derived functor LStφ :
h(Set∆)/∆n → hSet[n]
∆ is conservative. It will therefore suﬃce to show that the counit map LStφ ◦RU nφ → id
is an isomorphism of functors from hSet[n]
∆ to itself. For this, we must show that if F : [n] → Set∆ is
projectively ﬁbrant, then the counit map

StφU nφ F → F

is an equivalence in Set[n]
wish to prove that each of the induced maps

∆ . In other words, we may assume that F(i) is a Kan complex for i ∈ [n], and we

is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.
Let ψ : [n] → [1] be deﬁned by the formula

vi : (StφU nφ F)(i) → F(i)

ψ′(j) =

0
1

(

if 0 ≤ j ≤ i
otherwise.

Then, for every object X ∈ (Set∆)/∆n, we have isomorphisms

(StφX)(i) ≃ (Stψ◦φX)(0) ≃ |X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n}|Q• ,
where the twisted geometric realization functor ||Q• is as deﬁned in §2.2.2. Taking X = U nφ F, we see that
vi ﬁts into a commutative diagram

|X ×∆n {n − i}|Q•

|X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n}|Q•

Here the upper horizontal map is an isomorphism supplied by Corollary 2.2.2.11, and the right vertical map
is a weak homotopy equivalence by Proposition 2.2.2.10. Consequently, to prove that the map vi is a weak
homotopy equivalence, it will suﬃce to show that the left vertical map is a weak homotopy equivalence. In
view of Proposition 2.2.2.7, it will suﬃce to show that the inclusion

X ×∆n {n − i} ⊆ X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n}

is a weak homotopy equivalence. In fact, X ×∆n {n − i} is a deformation retract of X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n}: this
follows from the observation that the projection X → ∆n is a right ﬁbration (Proposition 2.1.4.9).

It will be convenient to restate Lemma 2.2.3.1 in a slightly modiﬁed form. First, we need to introduce a

bit of terminology.

Deﬁnition 2.2.3.2. Suppose given a commutative diagram of simplicial sets

X

p

(cid:31)@@@@@@@

f

S,

Y

(cid:127)~~~~~~~

q

where p and q are right ﬁbrations. We will say that f is a pointwise equivalence if, for each vertex s ∈ S, the
induced map Xs → Ys is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes.

Remark 2.2.3.3. In the situation of Deﬁnition 2.2.3.2, the following conditions are equivalent:

(a) The map f is a pointwise equivalence of right ﬁbrations over S.

(b) The map f is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/S.

(c) The map f is a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets.

The equivalence (a) ⇔ (b) follows from Corollary 2.2.3.13 (see below), and the equivalence (a) ⇔ (c) from
Proposition 3.3.1.5.

Lemma 2.2.3.4. Let S′ ⊆ S be simplicial sets. Let p : X → S be any map, and let q : Y → S be a right
ﬁbration. Let X ′ = X ×S S′ and Y ′ = Y ×S S′. The restriction map

φ : Map(Set∆)/S (X, Y ) → Map(Set∆)/S′ (X ′, Y ′)

is a Kan ﬁbration.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that φ is a right ﬁbration. It will suﬃce to show that φ has the right lifting property
with respect to every right anodyne inclusion A ⊆ B. This follows from the fact that q has the right lifting
property with respect to the induced inclusion

i : (B × S′)

(A × S) ⊆ B × S,

aA×S′

since i is again right anodyne (Corollary 2.1.2.7).

Applying the preceding argument to the inclusion ∅ ⊆ S′, we deduce that the projection map

Map(Set∆)/S′ (X ′, Y ′) → ∆0

is a right ﬁbration. Proposition 1.2.5.1 implies that Map(Set∆)/S′ (X ′, Y ′) is a Kan complex. Lemma 2.1.3.3
now implies that φ is a Kan ﬁbration as desired.

Lemma 2.2.3.5. Let U be a collection of simplicial sets. Suppose that:

(i) The collection U is stable under isomorphism. That is, if S ∈ U and S′ ≃ S, then S′ ∈ U.

(ii) The collection U is stable under the formation of disjoint unions.

(iii) Every simplex ∆n belongs to U.

(iv) Given a pushout diagram

in which X, X ′, and Y belong to U. If the map f is a monomorphism, then Y ′ belongs to U.

(v) Suppose given a sequence of monomorphisms of simplicial sets

X(0) → X(1) → . . .

If each X(i) belongs to U, then the colimit lim
−→

X(i) belongs to U.

Then every simplicial set belongs to U.

Proof. Let S be a simplicial set; we wish to show that S ∈ U. In view of (v), it will suﬃce to show that
each skeleton skn S belongs to U. We may therefore assume that S is ﬁnite dimensional. We now proceed
by induction on the dimension n of S. Let A denote the set of nondegenerate n-simplexes of S, so that we
have a pushout diagram

Proof. The implication (b) ⇒ (a) is clear (any homotopy inverse to f determines homotopy inverses for the
maps fs : Xs → Ys, for each vertex s ∈ S), and the implication (c) ⇒ (b) follows from Proposition 1.2.4.1.
We will prove that (a) ⇒ (c). Let U denote the collection of all simplicial sets A such that, for every map
A → S, composition with f induces a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes

Map(Set∆)/S (A, X) → Map(Set∆)/S (A, Y ).

We will show that U satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 2.2.3.5, and therefore contains all simplicial sets.
Conditions (i) and (ii) are obvious, and conditions (iv) and (v) follow from Lemma 2.2.3.4. It will therefore
suﬃce to show that every simplex ∆n belongs to U. For every map ∆n → S, we have a commutative diagram

Map(Set∆)/S

(∆n, X)

Map(Set∆)/S

(∆n, Y )

Map(Set∆)/S ({n}, X)

/ Map(Set∆)/S ({n}, Y ).

Since the inclusion {n} ⊆ ∆n is right anodyne, the vertical maps are trivial Kan ﬁbrations. It will therefore
suﬃce to show that the bottom horizontal map is a homotopy equivalence, which follows immediately from
(a).

Lemma 2.2.3.7. Let φ : C[∆n] → [n] be as in Lemma 2.2.3.1. Suppose given a right ﬁbration X → ∆n, a
projectively ﬁbrant diagram F ∈ Set[n]
∆ , and a weak equivalence of diagrams α : StφX → F. Then the adjoint
map X → U nφ F is a pointwise equivalence of left ﬁbrations over ∆n.

Proof. For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, let X(i) = X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n} ⊆ X. We observe that (StφX)(i) is canonically
isomorphic to the twisted geometric realization |X(i)|Q• , where Q• is deﬁned as in §2.2.2. Since X → ∆n
is a right ﬁbration, the ﬁber X ×∆n {i} is a deformation retract of X(i). Using Proposition 2.2.2.7, we
conclude that the induced inclusion |X ×∆n {n − i}|Q• → |X(i)|Q• is a weak homotopy equivalence. Since
α is a weak equivalence, we get weak equivalences |X ×∆n {n − i}|Q• → F(i) for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n. Using
Proposition 2.2.2.9, we deduce that the adjoint maps X ×∆n {n − i} → SingQ• F(i) are again weak homotopy
equivalences. The desired result now follows from the observation that SingQ• F(i) ≃ (U nφ F) ×∆n {n − i}
(Remark 2.2.2.11).

Notation 2.2.3.8. For every simplicial set S, we let RFib(S) denote the full subcategory of (Set∆)/S
spanned by those maps X → S which are right ﬁbrations.

Proposition 2.1.4.9 implies that if p : X → S exhibits X as a ﬁbrant object of the contravariant model
category (Set∆)/S, then p is a right ﬁbration. We will prove the converse below (Corollary 2.2.3.12). For
the moment, we will be content with the following weaker result:

Lemma 2.2.3.9. For every integer n ≥ 0, the inclusion i : (Set∆)◦

where F ∈ Set[n]
∆ is a projectively ﬁbrant diagram. Lemma 2.2.3.7 implies that the adjoint map X → U nφ F
is a pointwise equivalence of right ﬁbrations in ∆n, and therefore a homotopy equivalence in RFib(∆n)
(Lemma 2.2.3.6). It now suﬃces to observe that U nφ F ∈ (Set∆)◦

suﬃce to show that φS is an equivalence.

Let U denote the collection of simplicial sets S for which φS is an equivalence. We will show that U
satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 2.2.3.5, and therefore contains every simplicial set S. Conditions (i) and
(ii) are obviously satisﬁed, and condition (iii) follows from Lemma 2.2.3.10 and Proposition A.3.1.10. We

We conclude this section with one more result which will be useful in studying the Joyal model structure
on Set∆. Suppose that f : X → S is any map of simplicial sets, and {s} is a vertex of S. Let Q• denote the
cosimplicial object of Set∆ deﬁned in §2.2.2. Then we have a canonical map

|Xs|Q• ≃ (St{s}Xs)(s) → (StSX)(s).

Proposition 2.2.3.15. Suppose that f : X → S is a right ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Then for each vertex
s of S, the canonical map φ : |Xs|Q• → (StSX)(s) is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

Proof. Choose a weak equivalence StSX → F, where F : C[S]op → Set∆ is a projectively ﬁbrant diagram.
Theorem 2.2.1.2 implies that the adjoint map X → U nS(F) is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/S.
Applying the “only if” direction of Corollary 2.2.3.12, we conclude that each of the induced maps

Xs → (U nS F)s ≃ SingQ• F(s)

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes. Using Proposition 2.2.2.9, we deduce that the adjoint map
|Xs|Q• → F(s) is a weak homotopy equivalence. It follows from the two-out-of-three property that φ is also
a weak homotopy equivalence.

2.2.4 The Comparison Theorem

Let S be an ∞-category containing a pair of objects x and y, and let Q• denote the cosimplicial object of
Set∆ described in §2.2.2. We have a canonical map of simplicial sets

Moreover, in the special case where S is the nerve of a ﬁbrant simplicial category C, the composition

f : | HomR

S (x, y)|Q• → MapC[S](x, y).

| HomR

S (x, y)|Q•

f
→ MapC[S](x, y) → MapC(x, y)

can be identiﬁed with the counit map

| SingQ• MapC(x, y)|Q• → MapC(X, Y ),

and is therefore a weak equivalence (Proposition 2.2.2.10). Consequently, we may reformulate Theorem
2.2.0.1 in the following way:

Proposition 2.2.4.1. Let S be an ∞-category containing a pair of objects x and y. Then the natural map

is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

f : | HomR

S (x, y)|Q• → MapC[S](x, y)

f ′′ : (StSS/y)(x) → MapC[S](x, y).

| HomR

S (x, y)|Q• ≃ (St{x}S/y ×S {x})(x) → (StSS/y)(y).

Since the projection S/y → S is a right ﬁbration, the map f ′ is a weak homotopy equivalence (Proposition
2.2.3.15). It will therefore suﬃce to show that f ′′ is a weak homotopy equivalence. To see this, we consider
the commutative diagram

It follows that i is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/S
which is right anodyne by Corollary 2.1.2.7.
(Proposition 2.1.4.9), so the map g is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets. Since the map h is an
isomorphism, the map f ′′ is also a weak homotopy equivalence by virtue of the two-out-of-three property.

2.2.5 The Joyal Model Structure

The category of simplicial sets can be endowed with a model structure for which the ﬁbrant objects are
precisely the ∞-categories. The original construction of this model structure is due to Joyal, who uses
purely combinatorial arguments ([44]). In this section, we will exploit the relationship between simplicial
categories and ∞-categories to give an alternative description of this model structure. Our discussion will
make use of a model structure on the category Cat∆ of simplicial categories, which we review in §A.3.2.

Theorem 2.2.5.1. There exists a left proper, combinatorial model structure on the category of simplicial
sets with the following properties:

(C) A map p : S → S′ of simplicial sets is a coﬁbration if and only if it is a monomorphism.

(W ) A map p : S → S′ is a categorical equivalence if and only if the induced simplicial functor C[S] → C[S′]

is an equivalence of simplicial categories.

Moreover, the adjoint functors (C, N) determine a Quillen equivalence between Set∆ (with the model

structure deﬁned above) and Cat∆.

Our proof will make use of the theory of inner anodyne maps of simplicial sets, which we will study in

detail in §2.3. We ﬁrst establish a simple Lemma.

Lemma 2.2.5.2. Every inner anodyne map f : A → B of simplicial sets is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. It will suﬃce to prove that if f is inner anodyne, then the associated map C[f ] is a trivial coﬁbration
of simplicial categories. The collection of all morphisms f for which this statement holds is weakly saturated
(Deﬁnition A.1.2.2). Consequently, we may assume that f is an inner horn inclusion Λn
i ⊆ ∆n, 0 < i < n.
We now explicitly describe the map C[f ]:

80

'
7
/
• The objects of C[∂ Λn

i ] are the objects of C[∆n]: namely, elements of the linearly ordered set [n] =

{0, . . . , n}.

• For 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n, the simplicial set MapC[Λn

i ](j, k) is equal to MapC[∆n](j, k) unless j = 0 and k = n.

In the latter case,

MapC[Λn

i ](j, k) = K ⊆ (∆1)n−1 ≃ MapC[∆n](j, k),

where K is the simplicial subset of the cube (∆1)n−1 obtained by removing the interior and a single
face.

We observe that C[f ] is a pushout of the inclusion EK ⊆ E(∆1)n−1 (see §A.3.2 for an explanation of this
notation). It now suﬃces to observe that the inclusion K ⊆ (∆1)n−1 is trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets
(with respect to the usual model structure on Set∆).

Proof of Theorem 2.2.5.1. We ﬁrst show that C carries coﬁbrations of simplicial sets to coﬁbrations of simpli-
cial categories. Since the class of all coﬁbrations of simplicial sets is generated by the inclusions ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n,
it suﬃces to show that each map C[∂ ∆n] → C[∆n] is a coﬁbration of simplicial categories. If n = 0, then the
inclusion C[∂ ∆n] ⊆ C[∆n] is isomorphic to the inclusion ∅ ⊆ ∗ of simplicial categories, which is a coﬁbration.
In the case where n > 0, we make use of the following explicit description of C[∂ ∆n] as a subcategory of
C[∆n]:

• The objects of C[∂ ∆n] are the objects of C[∆n]: namely, elements of the linearly ordered set [n] =

{0, . . . , n}.

• For 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n, the simplicial set HomC[∂ ∆n](j, k) is equal to HomC[∆n](j, k) unless j = 0 and

k = n. In the latter case, HomC[∂ ∆n](j, k) consists of the boundary of the cube

(∆1)n−1 ≃ HomC[∆n](j, k).

In particular, the inclusion C[∂ ∆n] ⊆ C[∆n] is a pushout of the inclusion E∂(∆1)n−1 ⊆ E(∆1)n−1, which is

a coﬁbration of simplicial categories (see §A.3.2 for an explanation of our notation).

We now declare that a map p : S → S′ of simplicial sets is a categorical ﬁbration if it has the right lifting
property with respect to all maps which are coﬁbrations and categorical equivalences. We now claim that
the coﬁbrations, categorical equivalences, and categorical ﬁbrations determine a left proper, combinatorial
model structure on Set∆. To prove this, it will suﬃce to show that the hypotheses of Proposition A.2.6.13
are satisﬁed:

(1) The class of categorical equivalences in Set∆ is perfect. This follows from Corollary A.2.6.12, since
the functor C preserves ﬁltered colimits, and the class of equivalences between simplicial categories is
perfect.

(2) The class of categorical equivalences is stable under pushouts by coﬁbrations. Since C preserves coﬁ-

brations, this follows immediately from the left-properness of Cat∆.

(3) A map of simplicial sets which has the right lifting property with respect to all coﬁbrations is a
In other words, we must show that if p : S → S′ is a trivial ﬁbration of
categorical equivalence.
simplicial sets, then the induced functor C[p] : C[S] → C[S′] is an equivalence of simplicial categories.
Since p is a trivial ﬁbration, it admits a section s : S′ → S. It is clear that C[p] ◦ C[s] is the identity; it
therefore suﬃces to show that

C[s] ◦ C[p] : C[S] → C[S]

is homotopic to the identity.

Let K denote the simplicial set MapS′(S, S). Then K is a contractible Kan complex, containing points
x and y which classify s◦p and idS. We note the existence of a natural “evaluation map” e : K ×S → S,

81

such that s ◦ p = e ◦ ({x} × idS), idS = e ◦ ({y} × idS). It therefore suﬃces to show that the functor
C carries {x} × idS and {y} × idS into homotopic morphisms. Since both of these maps section the
projection K × S → S, it suﬃces to show that the projection C[K × S] → C[S] is an equivalence of
simplicial categories. Replacing S by S × K and S′ by S, we are reduced to the special case where
S = S′ × K and K is a contractible Kan complex.
By the small object argument, we can ﬁnd an inner anodyne map S′ → V , where V is an ∞-category.
The corresponding map S′ × K → V × K is also inner anodyne (Proposition 2.3.2.1), so the maps
C[S′] → C[V ] and C[S′ × K] → C[V × K] are both trivial coﬁbrations (Lemma 2.2.5.2). It follows
that we are free to replace S′ by V and S by V × K. In other words, we may suppose that S′ is
an ∞-category (and now we will have no further need of the assumption that S is isomorphic to the
product S′ × K).
Since p is surjective on vertices, it is clear that C[p] is essentially surjective. It therefore suﬃces to
show that for every pair of vertices x, y ∈ S0, the induced map of simplicial sets MapC[S](x, y) →
MapC[S′](p(x), p(y)) is a weak homotopy equivalence. Using Propositions 2.2.4.1 and 2.2.2.7, it suﬃces
to show that the map HomR
S′ (p(x), p(y)) is a weak homotopy equivalence. This map is
obviously a trivial ﬁbration if p is a trivial ﬁbration.

S (x, y) → HomR

By construction, the functor C preserves weak equivalences. We veriﬁed above that C preserves coﬁbra-

tions as well. It follows that the adjoint functors (C, N) determine a Quillen adjunction

Set∆

C

N

/ Cat∆

.

To complete the proof, we wish to show that this Quillen adjunction is a Quillen equivalence. According to
Proposition A.2.5.1, we must show that for every simplicial set S and every ﬁbrant simplicial category C, a
map

is a categorical equivalence if and only if the adjoint map

u : S → N(C)

v : C[S] → C

is an equivalence of simplicial categories. We observe that v factors as a composition

C[S]

C[u]
→ C[N(C)] w→ C .

By deﬁnition, u is a categorical equivalence if and only if C[u] is an equivalence of simplicial categories.
We now conclude by observing that the counit map w is an equivalence of simplicial categories (Theorem
2.2.0.1).

We now establish a few pleasant properties enjoyed by the Joyal model structure on Set∆. We ﬁrst note
that every object of Set∆ is coﬁbrant; in particular, the Joyal model structure is left proper (Proposition
A.2.4.2).

Remark 2.2.5.3. The Joyal model structure is not right proper. To see this, we note that the inclusion
Λ2
1 ⊆ ∆2 is a categorical equivalence, but it does not remain so after pulling back via the ﬁbration ∆{0,2} ⊆
∆2.

Corollary 2.2.5.4. Let f : A → B be a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets, and K an arbitrary
simplicial set. Then the induced map A × K → B × K is a categorical equivalence.

82

/
o
o
Proof. Choose an inner anodyne map B → Q, where Q is an ∞-category. Then B × K → Q × K is also inner
anodyne, hence a categorical equivalence (Lemma 2.2.5.2). It therefore suﬃces to prove that A× K → Q × K
is a categorical equivalence. In other words, we may suppose to begin with that B is an ∞-category.

Now choose a factorization A

f ′′
→ B where f ′ is an inner anodyne map and f ′′ is an inner ﬁbration.
Since B is an ∞-category, R is an ∞-category. The map A × K → R × K is inner anodyne (since f ′ is), and
therefore a categorical equivalence; consequently, it suﬃces to show that R × K → B × K is a categorical
equivalence. In other words, we may reduce to the case where A is also an ∞-category.

f ′
→ R

Choose an inner anodyne map K → S, where S is an ∞-category. Then A×K → A×S and B×K → B×S
are both inner anodyne, and therefore categorical equivalences. Thus, to prove that A × K → B × K is a
categorical equivalence, it suﬃces to show that A × S → B × S is a categorical equivalence. In other words,
we may suppose that K is an ∞-category.

Since A and K are ∞-categories, h(A × K ) ≃ hA × hK ; similarly h(B × K ) ≃ hB × hK . It follows that
A × K → B × K is essentially surjective, provided that f is essentially surjective. Furthermore, for any pair
of vertices (a, k), (a′, k′) ∈ (A × K)0, we have

HomR

A×K((a, k), (a′, k′)) ≃ HomR

A(a, a′) × HomR

K(k, k′)

HomR

B×K((f (a), k), (f (a′), k′)) ≃ HomR

B(f (a), f (a′)) × HomR

K(k, k′).

It follows that A × K → B × K is fully faithful, provided that f is fully faithful, which completes the
proof.

Remark 2.2.5.5. Since every inner anodyne map is a categorical equivalence, it follows that every categor-
ical ﬁbration p : X → S is a inner ﬁbration (see Deﬁnition 2.0.0.3). The converse is false in general; however,
it is true when S is a point. In other words, the ﬁbrant objects for the Joyal model structure on Set∆ are
precisely the ∞-categories. The proof will be given in §2.4.6, as Theorem 2.4.6.1. We will assume this result
for the remainder of the section. No circularity will result from this, since the proof of Theorem 2.4.6.1 will
not use any of the results proven below.

The functor C[•] does not generally commute with products. However, Corollary 2.2.5.4 implies that C

commutes with products in the following weak sense:

Corollary 2.2.5.6. Let S and S′ be simplicial sets. The natural map

C[S × S′] → C[S] × C[S′]

is an equivalence of simplicial categories.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that there are ﬁbrant simplicial categories C, C′ with S = N(C), S′ = N(C′). In this
case, we have a diagram

C[S × S′]

f
→ C[S] × C[S′]

g
→ C × C′ .

By the two-out-of-three property, it suﬃces to show that g and g ◦f are equivalences. Both of these assertions
follow immediately from the fact that the counit map C[N(D)] → D is an equivalence for any ﬁbrant simplicial
category D (Theorem 2.2.5.1).

In the general case, we may choose categorical equivalences S → T , S′ → T ′, where T and T ′ are nerves
of ﬁbrant simplicial categories. Since S × S′ → T × T ′ is a categorical equivalence, we reduce to the case
treated above.

Let K be a ﬁxed simplicial set, and let C be a simplicial set which is ﬁbrant with respect to the Joyal
model structure. Then C has the extension property with respect to all inner anodyne maps, and is therefore
a ∞-category. It follows that Fun(K, C) is also an ∞-category. We might call two morphisms f, g : K → C

83

homotopic if they are equivalent when viewed as objects of Fun(K, C). On the other hand, the general theory
of model categories furnishes another notion of homotopy: f and g are left homotopic if the map

can be extended over a mapping cylinder I for K.

K → C

Proposition 2.2.5.7. Let C be a ∞-category and K an arbitrary simplicial set. A pair of morphisms
f, g : K → C are homotopic if and only if they are left-homotopic.

Proof. Choose a contractible Kan complex S containing a pair of distinct vertices, x and y. We note that
the inclusion

K

K ≃ K × {x, y} ⊆ K × S

g : K

exhibits K × S as a mapping cylinder for K. It follows that f and g are left homotopic if and only if the
K → C admits an extension to K × S. In other words, f and g are left homotopic if and
map f
only if there exists a map h : S → CK such that h(x) = f and h(y) = g. We note that any such map factors
through Z, where Z ⊆ Fun(K, C) is the largest Kan complex contained in CK. Now, by classical homotopy
theory, the map h exists if and only if f and g belong to the same path component of Z. It is clear that this
holds if and only if f and g are equivalent when viewed as objects of the ∞-category Fun(K, C).

We are now in a position to prove Proposition 1.2.7.3, which was asserted without proof in §1.2.7. We

ﬁrst recall the statement.

Proposition. Let K be an arbitrary simplicial set.

(1) For every ∞-category C, the simplicial set Fun(K, C) is an ∞-category.

(2) Let C → D be a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories. Then the induced map Fun(K, C) → Fun(K, D)

is a categorical equivalence.

(3) Let C be an ∞-category, and K → K ′ a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets. Then the induced

map Fun(K ′, C) → Fun(K, C) is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (1). To show that Fun(K, C) is an ∞-category, it suﬃces to show that it has the
extension property with respect to every inner anodyne inclusion A ⊆ B. This is equivalent to the assertion
that C has the right lifting property with respect to the inclusion A × K ⊆ B × K. But C is an ∞-category
and A × K ⊆ B × K is inner anodyne (Corollary 2.3.2.4).

Let hSet∆ denote the homotopy category of Set∆, taken with respect to the Joyal model structure. For
each simplicial set X, we let [X] denote the same simplicial set, considered as an object of hSet∆. For every
pair of objects X, Y ∈ Set∆, [X × Y ] is a product for [X] and [Y ] in hSet∆. This is a general fact when X
and Y are ﬁbrant; in the general case, we choose ﬁbrant replacements X → X ′, Y → Y ′, and apply the fact
that the canonical map X × Y → X ′ × Y ′ is a categorical equivalence (Proposition 2.2.5.7).

If C is an ∞-category, then C is a ﬁbrant object of Set∆ (Theorem 2.4.6.1). Proposition 2.2.5.7 allows us
to identify HomhSet∆([X], [C]) with the set of equivalence classes of objects in the ∞-category Fun(X, C). In
particular, we have a canonical bijections

HomhSet∆([X] × [K], [C]) ≃ HomhSet∆([X × K], [C]) ≃ HomhSet∆([X], [Fun(K, C)]).
It follows that [Fun(K, C)] is determined up to canonical isomorphism by [K] and [C] (more precisely, it is
an exponential [C][K] in the homotopy category hSet∆), which proves (2) and (3).

Our description of the Joyal model structure on Set∆ is diﬀerent from the deﬁnition given in [44]. Namely,
Joyal deﬁnes a map f : A → B to be a weak categorical equivalence if, for every ∞-category C, the induced
map

hFun(B , C) → hFun(A, C)

is an equivalence (of ordinary categories). To prove that our deﬁnition agrees with his, it will suﬃce to prove
the following.

84

Proposition 2.2.5.8. Let f : A → B be a map of simplicial sets. Then f is a categorical equivalence if and
only if it is a weak categorical equivalence.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that f is a categorical equivalence. If C is an arbitrary ∞-category, Proposition 1.2.7.3
implies that the induced map Fun(B, C) → Fun(A, C) is a categorical equivalence, so that hFun(B , C) →
hFun(A, C) is an equivalence of categories. This proves that f is a weak categorical equivalence.

Conversely, suppose that f is a weak categorical equivalence. We wish to show that f induces an
isomorphism in the homotopy category of Set∆ with respect to the Joyal model structure. It will suﬃce
to show that for any ﬁbrant object C, f induces a bijection [B, C] → [A, C], where [X, C] denotes the set
of homotopy classes of maps from X to C. By Proposition 2.2.5.7, [X, C] may be identiﬁed with the set
of isomorphism classes of objects in the category hFun(X , C). By assumption, f induces an equivalence of
categories hFun(B , C) → hFun(A, C), and therefore a bijection on isomorphism classes of objects.

Remark 2.2.5.9. The proof of Proposition 1.2.7.3 makes use of Theorem 2.4.6.1, which asserts that the
(categorically) ﬁbrant objects of Set∆ are precisely the ∞-categories. Joyal proves the analogous assertion
for his model structure in [44]. We remark that one cannot formally deduce Theorem 2.4.6.1 from Joyal’s
result, since we need Theorem 2.4.6.1 to prove that Joyal’s model structure coincides with the one we have
deﬁned above. On the other hand, our approach does give a new proof of Joyal’s theorem.

Remark 2.2.5.10. Proposition 2.2.5.8 permits us to deﬁne the Joyal model structure without reference to
the theory of simplicial categories (this is Joyal’s original point of view [44]). Our approach is less elegant,
but allows us to easily compare the theory of ∞-categories with other models of higher category theory, such
as simplicial categories. There is another approach to obtaining comparison results, due to To¨en. In [76], he
shows that if C is a model category equipped with a cosimplicial object C• satisfying certain conditions, then
C is (canonically) Quillen equivalent to Rezk’s category of complete Segal spaces. To¨en’s theorem applies in
particular when C is the category of simplicial sets, and C• is the “standard simplex” Cn = ∆n. In fact,
Set∆ is in some sense universal with respect to this property, since it is generated by C• under colimits and
the class of categorical equivalences is dictated by To¨en’s axioms. We refer the reader to [76] for details.

2.3

Inner Fibrations

In this section, we will study the theory of inner ﬁbrations between simplicial sets. The meaning of this notion
is somewhat diﬃcult to motivate, because it has no counterpart in classical category theory: Proposition
1.1.2.2 implies that every functor between ordinary categories C → D induces an inner ﬁbration of nerves
N(C) → N(D).

In the case where S is a point, a map p : X → S is an inner ﬁbration if and only if X is an ∞-category.

Moreover, the class of inner ﬁbrations is stable under base change: if

X ′

p′

S′

/ X

p

/ S

is a pullback diagram of simplicial sets and p is an inner ﬁbration, then so is p′. It follows that if p : X → S
is an arbitrary inner ﬁbration, then each ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s} is an ∞-category. We may therefore think of
p as encoding a family of ∞-categories parametrized by S. However, the ﬁbers Xs depend functorially on s
only in a very weak sense.
Example 2.3.0.1. Let F : C → C′ be a functor between ordinary categories. Then the map N(C) → N(C′) is
an inner ﬁbration. Yet the ﬁbers N(C)C = N(C ×C′{C}) and N(C)D = N(C ×C′ {D}) over objects C, D ∈ C′
can have wildly diﬀerent properties, even if C and D are isomorphic objects of C′.

In order to describe how the diﬀerent ﬁbers of an inner ﬁbration are related to one another, we will intro-
duce the notion of a correspondence between ∞-categories. We review the classical theory of correspondences
in §2.3.1, and explain how to generalize this theory to the ∞-categorical setting.

In §2.3.2, we will prove that the class of inner anodyne maps is stable under smash products with arbitrary
coﬁbrations between simplicial sets. As a consequence, we will deduce that the class of inner ﬁbrations (and
hence the class of ∞-categories) is stable under the formation of mapping spaces.

In §2.3.3, we will study the theory of minimal inner ﬁbrations, a generalization of Quillen’s theory
of minimal Kan ﬁbrations.
In particular, we will deﬁne a class of minimal ∞-categories and show that
every ∞-category C is (categorically) equivalent to a minimal ∞-category C′, where C′ is well-deﬁned up
to (noncanonical) isomorphism. We will apply this theory in §2.3.4 to develop a theory of n-categories for
n < ∞.

2.3.1 Correspondences
Let C and C′ be categories. A correspondence from C to C′ is a functor

M : Cop × C′ → Set .

If M is a correspondence from C to C′, we can deﬁne a new category C ⋆M C′ as follows. An object of C ⋆M C′
is either an object of C or an object of C′. For morphisms, we take

HomC(X, Y )
HomC′(X, Y )
M (X, Y )
∅

if X, Y ∈ C
if X, Y ∈ C′
if X ∈ C, Y ∈ C′
if X ∈ C′, Y ∈ C .

HomC ⋆M C′(X, Y ) = 



Composition of morphisms is deﬁned in the obvious way, using the composition laws in C and C′, and the
functoriality of M (X, Y ) in X and Y .

Remark 2.3.1.1. In the special case where F : Cop × C′ → Set is the constant functor taking the value ∗,
the category C ⋆F C′ coincides with the ordinary join C ⋆ C′.

86

(cid:15)
(cid:15)

For any correspondence M : C → C′, there is an obvious functor F : C ⋆M C′ → [1] (here [1] denotes
the linearly ordered set {0, 1}, regarded as a category in the obvious way), uniquely determined by the
condition that F −1{0} = C and F −1{1} = C′. Conversely, given any category M equipped with a functor
F : M → [1], we can deﬁne C = F −1{0}, C′ = F −1{1}, and a correspondence M : C → C′ by the formula
M (X, Y ) = HomM(X, Y ). We may summarize the situation as follows:

Fact 2.3.1.2. Giving a pair of categories C, C′ and a correspondence between them is equivalent to giving a
category M equipped with a functor M → [1].

Given this reformulation, it is clear how to generalize the notion of a correspondence to the ∞-categorical

setting.

Deﬁnition 2.3.1.3. Let C and C′ be ∞-categories. A correspondence from C to C′ is a ∞-category M
equipped with a map F : M → ∆1 and identiﬁcations C ≃ F −1{0}, C′ ≃ F −1{1}.

Remark 2.3.1.4. Let C and C′ be ∞-categories. Fact 2.3.1.2 generalizes to the ∞-categorical setting in
the following way: there is a canonical bijection between equivalence classes of correspondences from C to
C′ and equivalence classes of functors Cop × C′ → S, where S denotes the ∞-category of spaces. In fact, it is
possible to prove a more precise result (a Quillen equivalence between certain model categories), but we will
not need this.

To understand the relevance of Deﬁnition 2.3.1.3, we note the following:

Proposition 2.3.1.5. Let C be an ordinary category, and let p : X → N(C) be a map of simplicial sets.
Then p is an inner ﬁbration if and only if X is an ∞-category.

Proof. This follows from the fact that any map Λn

i → N(C), 0 < i < n, admits a unique extension to ∆n.

It follows readily from the deﬁnition that an arbitrary map of simplicial sets p : X → S is an inner
ﬁbration if and only if the ﬁber of p over any simplex of S is an ∞-category. In particular, an inner ﬁbration
p associates to each vertex s of S an ∞-category Xs, and to each edge f : s → s′ in S a correspondence
between the ∞-categories Xs and Xs′ . Higher dimensional simplices give rise to what may be thought of as
compatible “chains” of correspondences.

Roughly speaking, we might think of an inner ﬁbration p : X → S as a functor from S into some
kind of ∞-category of ∞-categories, where the morphisms are given by correspondences. However, this
description is not quite accurate, since the correspondences are required to “compose” only in a weak sense.
To understand the issue, let us return to the setting of ordinary categories. If C and C′ are two categories,
then the correspondences from C to C′ themselves constitute a category, which we may denote by M (C, C′).
There is a natural “composition” deﬁned on correspondences. If we view an object F ∈ M (C, C′) as a functor
Cop × C′ → Set, and G ∈ M (C′, C′′), then we can deﬁne (G ◦ F )(C, C′′) to be the coend

F (C, C′) × G(C′, C′′).

ZC ′∈C′

If we view F as determining a category C ⋆F C′ and G as determining a category C′ ⋆G C′′, then C ⋆G◦F C′′

is obtained by forming the pushout

(C ⋆F C′)

(C′ ⋆G C′′)

C′
a

and then discarding the objects of C′.

Now, giving a category equipped with a functor to [2] is equivalent to giving a triple of categories C, C′,
C′′, together with correspondences F ∈ M (C, C′), G ∈ M (C′, C′′), H ∈ M (C, C′′) and a map α : G ◦ F → H.
But the map α need not be an isomorphism. Consequently, the above data cannot literally be interpreted
as a functor from [2] into a category (or even a higher category) in which the morphisms are given by
correspondences.

87

If C and C′ are categories, then a correspondence from C to C′ can be regarded as a kind of generalized
functor from C to C′. More speciﬁcally, for any functor f : C → C′, we can deﬁne a correspondence Mf by
the formula

Mf (X, Y ) = HomC′ (f (X), Y ).
This construction gives a fully faithful embedding MapCat(C, C′) → M (C, C′). Similarly, any functor g :
C′ → C determines a correspondence Mg given by the formula Mg(X, Y ) = HomC(X, g(Y )); we observe that
Mf ≃ Mg if and only if the functors f and g are adjoint to one another.

If an inner ﬁbration p : X → S corresponds to a “functor” from S to a higher category of ∞-categories
with morphisms given by correspondences, then some special class of inner ﬁbrations should correspond to
functors from S into an ∞-category of ∞-categories with morphisms given by actual functors. This is indeed
the case, and the appropriate notion is that of a (co)Cartesian ﬁbration which we will study in §2.4.

2.3.2 Stability Properties of Inner Fibrations

Let C be an ∞-category and K an arbitrary simplicial set.
In §1.2.7, we asserted that Fun(K, C) is an
∞-category (Proposition 1.2.7.3). In the course of the proof, we invoked certain stability properties of the
class of inner anodyne maps. The goal of this section is to establish the required properties, and deduce
some of their consequences. Our main result is the following analogue of Proposition 2.1.2.6:

Proposition 2.3.2.1 (Joyal [44]). The following collections all generate the same class of morphisms of
Set∆:

(1) The collection A1 of all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, 0 < i < n.

(2) The collection A2 of all inclusions

(∆m × Λ2
1)

(∂ ∆m × ∆2) ⊆ ∆m × ∆2.

a∂ ∆m×Λ2

1

(3) The collection A3 of all inclusions

(S′ × Λ2
1)

(S × ∆2) ⊆ S′ × ∆2,

aS×Λ2

1

where S ⊆ S′.

Proof. We will employ the strategy that we used to prove Proposition 2.1.2.6, though the details are slightly
more complicated. Working cell-by-cell, we conclude that every morphism in A3 belongs to the weakly
saturated class of morphisms generated by A2. We next show that every morphism in A1 is a retract of a
morphism belonging to A3. More precisely, we will show that for 0 < i < n, the inclusion Λn
i ⊆ ∆n is a
retract of the inclusion

(∆n × Λ2
1)

(Λn

i × ∆2) ⊆ ∆n × ∆2.

i ×Λ2
aΛn
1

To prove this, we embed ∆n into ∆n × ∆2 via the map of partially ordered sets s : [n] → [n] × [2] given by

(j, 0)
(j, 1)
(j, 2)

if j < i
if j = i
if j > i.

s(j) = 


and consider the retraction ∆n × ∆2 → ∆n given by the map

j
r(j, k) = 



if j < i, k = 0
if j > i, k = 2
otherwise.

We now show that every morphism in A2 is inner anodyne (that is, it lies in the weakly saturated class of
morphisms generated by A1). Choose m ≥ 0. For each 0 ≤ i ≤ j < m, we let σij denote the (m + 1)-simplex
of ∆m × ∆2 corresponding to the map



fij : [m + 1] → [m] × [2]

fij(k) = 

(k, 0)
(k − 1, 1)
(k − 1, 2)

if 0 ≤ k ≤ i
if i + 1 ≤ k ≤ j + 1
if j + 2 ≤ k ≤ m + 1.

For each 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ m, we let τij denote the (m + 2)-simplex of ∆m × ∆2 corresponding to the map



gij : [m + 2] → [m] × [2]

gij(k) = 

(k, 0)
(k − 1, 1)

if j + 2 ≤ k ≤ m + 2.

Let X(0) = (∆m × Λ2
1)

∂ ∆m×Λ2
1

(∂ ∆m × ∆2). For 0 ≤ j < m, we let



`

X(j + 1) = X(j) ∪ σ0j ∪ . . . ∪ σjj .

We have a chain of inclusions

X(j) ⊆ X(j) ∪ σ0j ⊆ . . . ⊂ X(j) ∪ σ0j ∪ . . . ∪ σjj = X(j + 1),

each of which is a pushout of a morphism in A1 and therefore inner anodyne. It follows that each inclusion
X(j) ⊆ X(j + 1) is inner-anodyne. Set Y (0) = X(m), so that the inclusion X(0) ⊆ Y (0) is inner anodyne.
We now set Y (j + 1) = Y (j) ∪ τ0j ∪ . . . ∪ τjj for 0 ≤ j ≤ m. As before, we have a chain of inclusions

Y (j) ⊆ Y (j) ∪ τ0j ⊆ . . . ⊆ Yj ∪ τ0j ∪ . . . ∪ τjj = Y (j + 1)

each of which is a pushout of a morphism belonging to A1. It follows that each inclusion Y (j) ⊆ Y (j + 1)
is inner anodyne. By transitivity, we conclude that the inclusion X(0) ⊆ Y (m + 2) is inner anodyne. We
conclude the proof by observing that Y (m + 2) = ∆m × ∆2.

Corollary 2.3.2.2 (Joyal [44]). A simplicial set C is an ∞-category if and only if the restriction map

is a trivial ﬁbration.

Fun(∆2, C) → Fun(Λ2

1, C)

Proof. By Proposition 2.3.2.1, C → ∗ is an inner ﬁbration if and only if S has the extension property with
respect to each of the inclusions in the class A2.

Remark 2.3.2.3. In §1.1.2, we asserted that the main function of the weak Kan condition on a simplicial
set C is that it allows us to compose the edges of C. We can regard Corollary 2.3.2.2 as an aﬃrmation of this
philosophy: the class of ∞-categories C is characterized by the requirement that one can compose morphisms
in C, and the composition is well-deﬁned up to a contractible space of choices.

89

Corollary 2.3.2.4 (Joyal [44]). Let i : A → A′ be an inner anodyne map of simplicial sets, and let j : B → B′
be a coﬁbration. Then the induced map

is inner anodyne.

(A × B′)

(A′ × B) → A′ × B′

aA×B

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.3.2.1, which characterizes the class of inner anodyne
maps as the class generated by A3 (which is stable under smash products with any coﬁbration).

Corollary 2.3.2.5 (Joyal [44]). Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration, and let i : A → B be any coﬁbration
of simplicial sets. Then the induced map q : X B → X A ×SA SB is an inner ﬁbration. If i is inner anodyne,
then q is a trivial ﬁbration. In particular, if X is a ∞-category, then so is X B for any simplicial set B.

2.3.3 Minimal Fibrations

One of the aims of homotopy theory is to understand the classiﬁcation of spaces up to homotopy equivalence.
In the setting of simplicial sets, this problem admits an attractive formulation in terms of Quillen’s theory
of minimal Kan complexes. Every Kan complex X is homotopy equivalent to a minimal Kan complex, and
a map X → Y of minimal Kan complexes is a homotopy equivalence if and only if it is an isomorphism.
Consequently, the classiﬁcation of Kan complexes up to homotopy equivalence is equivalent to the classi-
ﬁcation of minimal Kan complexes up to isomorphism. Of course, in practical terms, this is not of much
use for solving the classiﬁcation problem. Nevertheless, the theory of minimal Kan complexes (and, more
generally, minimal Kan ﬁbrations) is a useful tool in the homotopy theory of simplicial sets. The purpose
of this section is to describe a generalization of the theory of minimal models, in which Kan ﬁbrations are
replaced by inner ﬁbrations. An exposition of this theory can also be found in [44].

We begin by introducing a bit of terminology. Suppose given a commutative diagram

u /
/ X
>~
~

p

A

i

B

~

~
v

S

of simplicial sets where p is an inner ﬁbration, and suppose also that we have a pair f, f ′ : B → X of
candidates for the dotted arrow which render the diagram commutative. We will say that f and f ′ are
homotopic relative to A over S if they are equivalent when viewed as objects in the ∞-category given by the
ﬁber of the map

X B → X A ×SA SB.
Equivalently, f and f ′ are homotopic relative to A over S if there exists a map F : B × ∆1 → X such that
F |B × {0} = f , F |B × {1} = f ′, p ◦ F = v ◦ πB, F ◦ (i × id∆1) = u ◦ πA, and F |{b} × ∆1 is an equivalence
in the ∞-category Xv(b) for every vertex b of B.

Deﬁnition 2.3.3.1. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. We will say that p is minimal if
f = f ′ for every pair of maps f, f ′ : ∆n → X which are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n over S.

We will say that an ∞-category C is minimal if the associated inner ﬁbration C → ∗ is minimal.

Remark 2.3.3.2. In the case where p is a Kan ﬁbration, Deﬁnition 2.3.3.1 recovers the usual notion of a
minimal Kan ﬁbration. We refer the reader to [32] for a discussion of minimal ﬁbrations in this more classical
setting.

Remark 2.3.3.3. Let p : X → ∆n be an inner ﬁbration. Then X is an ∞-category. Moreover, p is a
minimal inner ﬁbration if and only if X is a minimal ∞-category. This follows from the observation that
for any pair of maps f, f ′ : ∆m → X, a homotopy between f and f ′ is automatically compatible with the
projection to ∆n.

Remark 2.3.3.4. If p : X → S is a minimal inner ﬁbration and T → S is an arbitrary map of simplicial
sets, then the induced map XT = X ×S T → T is a minimal inner ﬁbration. Conversely, if p : X → S is an
inner ﬁbration and if X ×S ∆n → ∆n is minimal for every map σ : ∆n → S, then p is minimal. Consequently,
for many purposes the study of minimal inner ﬁbrations reduces to the study of minimal ∞-categories.

Lemma 2.3.3.5. Let C be a minimal ∞-category, and let f : C → C be a functor which is homotopic to the
identity. Then f is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

Proof. Choose a homotopy h : ∆1 × C → C from idC to f . We prove by induction on n that the map f
induces an injection from the set of n-simplices of C to itself. Let σ, σ′ : ∆n → C be such that f ◦ σ = f ◦ σ′.
By the inductive hypothesis, we deduce that σ| ∂ ∆n = σ′| ∂ ∆n = σ0. Consider the diagram

(∆2 × ∂ ∆n)

2 × ∆n is given by amalgamating h ◦ (id∆1 ×σ) with h ◦ (id∆1 ×σ′), and G0|∆2 × ∂ ∆n is given

∆2 × ∂ ∆n → ∆1 × ∂ ∆n σ0→ ∆1 × C h→ C .
Since h|∆1 × {X} is an equivalence for every object X ∈ C, Proposition 2.4.1.8 implies the existence of the
map G indicated in the diagram. The restriction G|∆1 × ∆n is a homotopy between σ and σ′ relative to
∂ ∆n. Since C is minimal, we deduce that σ = σ′.

Lemma 2.3.3.6. Let C be a minimal ∞-category, and let f : C → C be a functor which is homotopic to the
identity. Then f is an isomorphism of simplicial sets.

Proof. Choose a homotopy h : ∆1 × C → C from idC to f . We prove by induction on n that the map f
induces a bijection from the set of n-simplices of C to itself. The injectivity follows from Lemma 2.3.3.5, so
it will suﬃce to prove the surjectivity. Choose an n-simplex σ : ∆n → C. By the inductive hypothesis, we
may suppose that σ| ∂ ∆n = f ◦ σ′

0 : ∂ ∆n → C. Consider the diagram

indicated in the diagram follows from Proposition 2.4.1.8; if n = 0 it is obvious. Now let σ′ = G|{0} × ∆n.
To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that f ◦ σ′ = σ.

The existence of the dotted arrow H follows once again from Proposition 2.4.1.8. The restriction H|∆{1,2} ×
∆n is a homotopy from f ◦ σ′ to σ relative to ∂ ∆n. Since C is minimal, we conclude that f ◦ σ′ = σ as
desired.

Proposition 2.3.3.7. Let f : C → D be an equivalence of minimal ∞-categories. Then f is an isomorphism.

Proof. Since f is a categorical equivalence, it admits a homotopy inverse g : D → C. Now apply Lemma
2.3.3.6 to the compositions f ◦ g and g ◦ f .

The following result guarantees a good supply of minimal ∞-categories:

Proposition 2.3.3.8. Let p : X → S be a inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Then there exists a retraction
r : X → X onto a simplicial subset X ′ ⊆ X with the following properties:

(1) The restriction p|X ′ : X ′ → S is a minimal inner ﬁbration.

(2) The retraction r is compatible with the projection p, in the sense that p ◦ r = p.

(3) The map r is homotopic over S to idX relative to X ′.

(4) For every map of simplicial sets T → S, the induced inclusion X ′ ×S T ⊆ X ×S T is a categorical

equivalence.

Proof. For every n ≥ 0, we deﬁne a relation on the set of n-simplices of X: given two simplices σ, σ′ :
∆n → X, we will write σ ∼ σ′ if σ is homotopic to σ′ relative to ∂ ∆n. We note that σ ∼ σ′ if and only if
σ| ∂ ∆n = σ′| ∂ ∆n and σ is equivalent to σ′ where both are viewed as objects in the ∞-category given by a
ﬁber of the map

X ∆n

→ X ∂ ∆n

×S∂ ∆n S∆n

.

Consequently, ∼ is an equivalence relation.

Suppose that σ and σ′ are both degenerate, and σ ∼ σ′. From the equality σ| ∂ ∆n = σ′| ∂ ∆n we deduce
that σ = σ′. Consequently, there is at most one degenerate n-simplex of X in each ∼-class. Let Y (n) ⊆ Xn
denote a set of representatives for the ∼-classes of n-simplices in X, which contains all degenerate simplices.
We now deﬁne the simplicial subset X ′ ⊆ X recursively as follows: an n-simplex σ : ∆n → X belongs to X ′
if σ ∈ Y (n) and σ| ∂ ∆n factors through X ′.

Let us now prove (1). To show that p|X ′ is an inner ﬁbration, it suﬃces to prove that every lifting

problem of the form

Λn
i

|

∆n

X ′

=|

s

|

σ
|

/ S

with 0 < i < n has a solution f in X ′. Since p is an inner ﬁbration, this lifting problem has a solution
0 = diσ : ∆n−1 → X be the induced map. Then
σ′ : ∆n → X in the original simplicial set X. Let σ′
0 is homotopic over S, relative to ∂ ∆n−1 to some map
σ′
0| ∂ ∆n−1 factors through X ′. Consequently, σ′
σ0 : ∆n−1 → X ′. Let g0 : ∆1 × ∆n−1 → X be a homotopy from σ′
0 to σ0, and let g1 : ∆1 × ∂ ∆n → X be
the result of amalgamating g0 with the identity homotopy from s to itself. Let σ1 = g1|{1} × ∂ ∆n. Using
Proposition 2.4.1.8, we deduce that g1 extends to a homotopy from σ′ to some other map σ′′ : ∆n → X
with σ′′| ∂ ∆n = σ1. It follows that σ′′ is homotopic over S relative to ∂ ∆n to a map σ : ∆n → X with the
desired properties. This proves that p|X ′ is an inner ﬁbration. It is immediate from the construction that
p|X ′ is minimal.

We now verify (2) and (3) by constructing a map h : X × ∆1 → X such that h|X × {0} is the identity,
h|X × {1} is a retraction r : X → X with image X ′, and h is a homotopy over S and relative to X ′. Choose
an exhaustion of X by a transﬁnite sequence of simplicial subsets

X ′ = X 0 ⊆ X 1 ⊆ . . .

by induction on α. By the inductive hypothesis, we may suppose that we have already deﬁned h<α =
∂ ∆n ∆n corresponding
h|X <α × ∆1. If X = X <α, then we are done. Otherwise, we can write X α = X <α
to some nondegenerate simplex τ : ∆n → X, and it suﬃces to deﬁne hα|∆n × ∆1. If τ factors through X ′,
we deﬁne hα|∆n × ∆1 to be the composition

Otherwise, we use Proposition 2.4.1.8 to deduce the existence of the dotted arrow h′ in the diagram

∆n × ∆1 → ∆n σ→ X.

Let τ ′ = h′|∆n × {1}. Then τ ′| ∂ ∆n factors through X ′. It follows that there is a homotopy h′′ : ∆n ×
∆{1,2} → X from τ ′ to τ ′′, which is over S and relative to ∂ ∆n, and such that τ ′′ factors through X ′. Now
consider the diagram

∂ ∆n × ∆2 → ∂ ∆n × ∆1 h<α→ X.

Using the fact that p is an inner ﬁbration, we deduce that there exists a dotted arrow H rendering the
diagram commutative. We may now deﬁne hα|∆n × ∆1 = H|∆n × ∆{0,2}; it is easy to see that this extension
has all the desired properties.

We now prove (4). Using Proposition 3.2.2.8, we can reduce to the case where T = ∆n. Without loss of
generality, we can replace S by T = ∆n, so that X and X ′ are ∞-categories. The above constructions show
that r : X → X ′ is a homotopy inverse of the inclusion i : X ′ → X, so that i is an equivalence as desired.

We conclude by recording a property of minimal ∞-categories which makes them very useful for certain

applications.

Proposition 2.3.3.9. Let C be a minimal ∞-category, and let σ : ∆n → C be an n-simplex of C such that
σ|∆{i,i+1} = idC : C → C is a degenerate edge. Then σ = siσ0 for some σ0 : ∆n−1 → C.

Proof. We work by induction on n. Let σ0 = di+1σ and let σ′ = siσ0. We will prove that σ = σ′. Our ﬁrst
goal is to prove that σ| ∂ ∆n = σ′| ∂ ∆n; in other words, that dj σ = djσ′ for 0 ≤ j ≤ n. If j = i + 1 this is
obvious; if j /∈ {i, i + 1} then it follows from the inductive hypothesis. Let us consider the case i = j, and set
σ1 = diσ. We need to prove that σ0 = σ1. The argument above establishes that σ0| ∂ ∆n−1 = σ1| ∂ ∆n−1.
Since C is minimal, it will suﬃce to show that σ0 and σ1 are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n−1. We now observe
that

Since σ and σ′ coincide on ∂ ∆n, to prove that σ = σ′ it will suﬃce to prove that σ and σ′ are homotopic

relative to ∂ ∆n. We now observe that

(snσ′, . . . , si+2σ′, siσ′, siσ, si−1σ, . . . , s0σ)

We can interpret Proposition 2.3.3.9 as asserting that in a minimal ∞-category C, composition is “strictly
unital”. For example, in the special case where n = 2 and i = 1, Proposition 2.3.3.9 asserts that if f : X → Y
is a morphism in an ∞-category C, then f is the unique composition idY ◦f .

2.3.4 n-Categories
The theory of ∞-categories can be regarded as a generalization of classical category theory: if C is an ordinary
category, then its nerve N(C) is an ∞-category which determines C up to canonical isomorphism. Moreover,
Proposition 1.1.2.2 provides a precise characterization of those ∞-categories which can be obtained from
ordinary categories. In this section, we will explain how to specialize the theory of ∞-categories to obtain a
theory of n-categories, for every nonnegative integer n. (However, the ideas described here are appropriate
for describing only those n-categories which have only invertible k-morphisms, for every k ≥ 2.)

Before we can give the appropriate deﬁnition, we need to introduce a bit of terminology. Let f, f ′ :
K → C be two diagrams in an ∞-category C, and suppose that K ′ ⊆ K is a simplicial subset such that
f |K ′ = f ′|K ′ = f0. We will say that f and f ′ are homotopic relative to K ′ if they are equivalent when
viewed as objects of the ∞-category Fun(K, C)×Fun(K ′,C) {f0}. Equivalently, f and f ′ are homotopic relative
to K ′ if there exists a homotopy

with the following properties:

(i) The restriction h|K ′ × ∆1 coincides with the composition

h : K × ∆1 → C

K ′ × ∆1 → K ′ f0→ C .

(ii) The restriction h|K × {0} coincides with f .

(iii) The restriction h|K × {1} coincides with f ′.

(iv) For every vertex x of K, the restriction h|{x} × ∆1 is an equivalence in C.

We observe that if K ′ contains every vertex of K, then condition (iv) follows from condition (i).

Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. Let C be a simplicial set and n ≥ −1 an integer. We will say that C is an n-category if
it is an ∞-category and the following additional conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) Given a pair of maps f, f ′ : ∆n → C, if f and f ′ are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n, then f = f ′.

(2) Given m > n and a pair of maps f, f ′ : ∆m → C, if f | ∂ ∆m = f ′| ∂ ∆m, then f = f ′.

It is sometimes convenient to extend Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 to the case where n = −2: we will say that a

simplicial set C is a (−2)-category if it is a ﬁnal object of Set∆: in other words, if it is isomorphic to ∆0.

Example 2.3.4.2. Let C be a (−1)-category. Using condition (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1, one shows by
induction on m that C has at most one m-simplex. Consequently, we see that up to isomorphism there are
precisely two (−1)-categories: ∆−1 ≃ ∅ and ∆0.

94

Example 2.3.4.3. Let C be a 0-category, and let X = C0 denote the set of objects of C. Let us write x ≤ y
if there is a morphism φ from x to y in C. Since C is an ∞-category, this relation is reﬂexive and transitive.
Moreover, condition (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 guarantees that the morphism φ is unique if it exists. If x ≤ y
and y ≤ x, it follows that the morphisms relating x and y are mutually inverse equivalences. Condition (1)
then implies that x = y. We deduce that (X, ≤) is a partially ordered set. It follows from Proposition 2.3.4.5
below that the map C → N(X) is an isomorphism.

Conversely, it is easy to see that the nerve of any partially ordered set (X, ≤) is a 0-category in the sense
of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. Consequently, the full subcategory of Set∆ spanned by the 0-categories is equivalent to
the category of partially ordered sets.

Remark 2.3.4.4. Let C be an n-category, and let m > n + 1. Then the restriction map

θ : HomSet∆ (∆m, C) → HomSet∆(∂ ∆m, C)

is bijective. If n = −1, this is clear from Example 2.3.4.2; let us therefore suppose that n ≥ 0, so that m ≥ 2.
The injectivity of θ follows immediately from part (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. To prove the surjectivity, we
consider an arbitrary map f0 : ∂ ∆m → C. Let f : ∆m → C be an extension of f0|Λm
1 (which exists since C
is an ∞-category, and 0 < 1 < m). Using condition (2) again, we deduce that θ(f ) = f0.

The following result shows that, in the case where n = 1, Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 recovers the usual deﬁnition

of a category:

Proposition 2.3.4.5. Let S be a simplicial set. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The unit map u : S → N(hS ) is an isomorphism of simplicial sets.

(2) There exists a small category C and an isomorphism S ≃ N(C) of simplicial sets.

(3) The simplicial set S is a 1-category.

Proof. The implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) are clear. Let us therefore assume that (3) holds, and show that
f : S → N(hS ) is an isomorphism. We will prove, by induction on n, that the map u is bijective on
n-simplices.

For n = 0, this is clear. If n = 1, the surjectivity of u obvious. To prove the injectivity, we note that if
f (φ) = f (ψ), then the edges φ and ψ are homotopic in S. A simple application of condition (2) of Deﬁnition
2.3.4.1 then shows that φ = ψ.

Now suppose n > 1. The injectivity of u on n-simplices follows from condition (3) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1, and
the injectivity of u on (n−1)-simplices. To prove the surjectivity, let us suppose given a map s : ∆n → N(hS ).
Choose 0 < i < n. Since u is bijective on lower-dimensional simplices, the map s|Λn
i factors uniquely through
s : ∆n → S. Since N(hS ) is the nerve
S. Since S is an ∞-category, this factorization extends to a map
of a category, a pair of maps from ∆n into N(hS ) which agree on Λn
i must be the same. We deduce that
u ◦

s = s, and the proof is complete.

Remark 2.3.4.6. The condition that an ∞-category C be an n-category is not invariant under categorical
equivalence. For example, if D is a category with several objects, all of which are uniquely isomorphic to one
another, then N(D) is categorically equivalent to ∆0, but is not a (−1)-category. Consequently, there can
be no intrinsic characterization of the class of n-categories itself. Nevertheless, there does exist a convenient
description for the class of ∞-categories which are equivalent to n-categories; see Proposition 2.3.4.18.

Our next goal is to establish that the class of n-categories is stable under the formation of functor
categories. In order to do so, we need to reformulate Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 in a more invariant manner. Recall
that for any simplicial set X, the n-skeleton skn X is deﬁned to be the simplicial subset of X generated by
all the simplices of X having dimension ≤ n.

Proposition 2.3.4.7. Let C be an ∞-category and n ≥ −1. The following are equivalent:

95

(1) The ∞-category C is an n-category.

(2) For every simplicial set K and every pair of maps f, f ′ : K → C such that f | skn K and f ′| skn K are

homotopic relative to skn−1 K, we have f = f ′.

Proof. The implication (2) ⇒ (1) is obvious. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed and let f, f ′ : K → C be as in
the statement of (2). To prove that f = f ′ it suﬃces to show that f and f ′ agree on every nondegenerate
simplex of K. We may therefore reduce to the case where K = ∆m. We now work by induction on m. If
m < n, there is nothing to prove. In the case m = n, the assumption that C is an n-category immediately
implies that f = f ′. If m > n, the inductive hypothesis implies that f | ∂ ∆m = f ′| ∂ ∆m, so that (1) implies
that f = f ′.

Corollary 2.3.4.8. Let C be an n-category and X a simplicial set. Then Fun(X, C) is an n-category.

Proof. Proposition 1.2.7.3 asserts that Fun(X, C) is an ∞-category. We will show that Fun(X, C) satisﬁes
condition (2) of Proposition 2.3.4.7. Suppose given a pair of maps f, f ′ : K → Fun(X, C) such that f | skn K
and f ′| skn K are homotopic relative to f | skn−1 K. We wish to show that f = f ′. We may identify f and
f ′ with maps F, F ′ : K × X → C. Since C is an n-category, to prove that F = F ′ it suﬃces to show that
F | skn(K × X) and F ′| skn(K × X) are homotopic relative to skn−1(K × X). This follows at once, since
skp(K × X) ⊆ (skp K) × X for every integer p.

When n = 1, Proposition 1.1.2.2 asserts that the class of n-categories can be characterized by the

uniqueness of certain horn ﬁllers. We now prove a generalization of this result.

Proposition 2.3.4.9. Let n ≥ 1, and let C be an ∞-category. Then C is an n-category if and only if it
satisﬁes the following condition:

• For every m > n and every diagram

where 0 < i < m, there exists a unique dotted arrow f as indicated, which renders the diagram

0 < i < m and m > n. We wish to prove that f = f ′. Since Λm
i
it will suﬃce (by Proposition 2.3.4.7) to show that f and f ′ are homotopic relative to Λm
immediately from the fact that the inclusion Λm
Now suppose that every map f0 : Λm

i ⊆ ∆m is a categorical equivalence.

i , where
contains the (n − 1)-skeleton of ∆m,
i . This follows

i → C, where 0 < i < m and n < m, extends uniquely to an
m-simplex of C. We will show that C satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. Condition (2) is
obvious: if f, f ′ : ∆m → C are two maps which coincide on ∂ ∆m, then they coincide on Λm
1 and are therefore
equal to one another (here we use the fact that m > 1 because of our assumption that n ≥ 1). Condition (1)
is a bit more subtle. Suppose that f, f ′ : ∆n → C are homotopic via a homotopy h : ∆n × ∆1 → C which is
constant on ∂ ∆n × ∆1. For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, let σi denote the (n + 1)-simplex of C obtained by composing h with
the map

we conclude that σi = sidiσi, so that diσi = di+1σi. A dual argument establishes the same equality for
0 < i. Since n > 0, we conclude that diσi = di+1σi for all i. Consequently, we have a chain of equalities

i+1 is equivalent to the restriction (sidiσi)|Λn+1

f ′ = d0σ0 = d1σ0 = d1σ1 = d2σ1 = . . . = dnσn = dn+1σn = f

so that f ′ = f , as desired.

Corollary 2.3.4.10. Let C be an n-category and let p : K → C be a diagram. Then C/p is an n-category.

Proof. If n ≤ 0, this follows easily from Examples 2.3.4.2 and 2.3.4.3. We may therefore suppose that n ≥ 1.
Proposition 1.2.9.3 implies that C/p is an ∞-category. According to Proposition 2.3.4.9, it suﬃces to show
that for every m > n, 0 < i < m, and every map f0 : Λm
i → C/p, there exists a unique map f : ∆m → C/p
extending f . Equivalently, we must show that there is a unique map g rendering the diagram

commutative. The existence of g follows from the fact that C/p is an ∞-category. Suppose that g′ : ∆m ⋆K →
C is another map which extends g0. Proposition 1.1.2.2 implies that g′|∆m = g|∆m. We conclude that g
and g′ coincide on the n-skeleton of ∆m ⋆ K. Since C is an n-category, we deduce that g = g′ as desired.

We conclude this section by introducing a construction which allows us to pass from an arbitrary ∞-
category C to its “underlying” n-category, by discarding information about morphisms of order > n. In
the case where n = 1, we have already introduced the relevant construction: we simply replace C by its
homotopy category (or, more precisely, the nerve of its homotopy category).

Notation 2.3.4.11. Let C be an ∞-category and let n ≥ 1. For every simplicial set K, let [K, C]n ⊆
Fun(skn K, C) be the subset consisting of those diagrams skn K → C which extend to the (n + 1)-skeleton
of K (in other words, the image of the restriction map Fun(skn+1 K, C) → Fun(skn K, C)). We deﬁne an
equivalence relation ∼ on [K, C]n as follows: given two maps f, g : skn K → C, we write f ∼ g if f and g are
homotopic relative to skn−1 K.

Proposition 2.3.4.12. Let C be an ∞-category and n ≥ 1.

(1) There exists a simplicial set hnC with the following universal mapping property: Fun(K, hnC) =

[K, C]n/ ∼.

(2) The simplicial set hnC is an n-category.

(3) If C is an n-category, then the natural map θ : C → hnC is an isomorphism.

(4) For every n-category D, composition with θ induces an isomorphism of simplicial sets

ψ : Fun(hnC, D) → Fun(C, D).

Proof. To prove (1), we begin by deﬁning hnC([m]) = [∆m, C]n/ ∼, so that the desired universal property
holds by deﬁnition whenever K is a simplex. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, to check the universal property for
a general simplicial set K we must verify the following fact:

(∗) Given two maps f, g : ∂ ∆n+1 → C which are homotopic relative to skn−1 ∆n+1, if f extends to an

(n + 1)-simplex of C, then g extends to an (n + 1)-simplex of C.

This follows easily from Proposition A.2.3.1.

We next show that hnC is an ∞-category. Let η0 : Λm

wish to show that η0 extends to an m-simplex η : ∆m → C. If m ≤ n + 2, then Λm
can be written as a composition

i → hnC be a morphism, where 0 < i < m. We

The existence of η now follows from our assumption that C is an ∞-category.
HomSet∆(Λm

i , hnC) ≃ HomSet∆ (∆m, hnC) by construction, so there is nothing to prove.

If m > n + 2, then

We next prove that hnC is an n-category. It is clear from the construction that for m > n, any two
m-simplices of hnC with the same boundary must coincide. Suppose next that we are given two maps
f, f ′ : ∆n → hnC which are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n. Let F : ∆n × ∆1 → hnC be a homotopy from f to
f ′. Using (∗), we deduce that F is the image under θ of a map
F | ∂ ∆n × ∆1
factors through the projection ∂ ∆n × ∆1 → ∂ ∆n. Since n > 0, we conclude that
F is a homotopy from
F |∆n × {0} to
e

F |∆n × {1}, so that f = f ′. This completes the proof of (2).

F : ∆n × ∆1 → hnC, where

e

To prove (3), let us suppose that C is an n-category; we prove by induction on m that the map C → hnC
is bijective on m-simplices. For m < n, this is clear. When m = n it follows from part (1) of Deﬁnition
e
2.3.4.1. When m = n + 1, surjectivity follows from the construction of hn C, and injectivity from part (2) of
Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. For m > n + 1, we have a commutative diagram

where the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism by the inductive hypothesis, the left vertical map is an
isomorphism by construction, and the right vertical map is an isomorphism by Remark 2.3.4.4; it follows
that the upper horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.

To prove (4), we observe that if D is an n-category, then the composition

is an inverse to φ, where the second isomorphism is given by (3).

Fun(C, D) → Fun(hnC, hnD) ≃ Fun(hnC, D)

Remark 2.3.4.13. The construction of Proposition 2.3.4.12 does not quite work if n ≤ 0, since there may
exist equivalences in hn C which do not arise from equivalences in C. However, it is a simple matter to give
an alternative construction in these cases which satisﬁes conditions (2), (3), and (4); we leave the details to
the reader.

Remark 2.3.4.14. In the case n = 1, the ∞-category h1C constructed in Proposition 2.3.4.12 is isomorphic
to the nerve of the homotopy category hC.

We now apply the theory of minimal ∞-categories (§2.3.3) to obtain a characterization of the class of
∞-categories which are equivalent to n-categories. First, we need a deﬁnition from classical homotopy theory.

Deﬁnition 2.3.4.15. Let k ≥ −1 be an integer. A Kan complex X is k-truncated if, for every i > k and
every point x ∈ X, we have

πi(X, x) ≃ ∗.

By convention, we will also say that X is (−2)-truncated if X is contractible.

Remark 2.3.4.16. If X and Y are homotopy equivalent Kan complexes, then X is k-truncated if and only
if Y is k-truncated. In other words, we may view k-truncatedness as a condition on objects in the homotopy
category H of spaces.

Example 2.3.4.17. A Kan complex X is (−1)-truncated if it is either empty or contractible.
It is 0-
truncated if the natural map X → π0X is a homotopy equivalence (equivalently, X is 0-truncated if it is
homotopy equivalent to a discrete space).

Proposition 2.3.4.18. Let C be an ∞-category and n ≥ −1. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) There exists a minimal model C′ ⊆ C such that C′ is an n-category.

(2) There exists a categorical equivalence D → C, where D is an n-category.

(3) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the mapping space MapC(X, Y ) ∈ H is (n − 1)-truncated.

Proof. It is clear that (1) implies (2). Suppose next that (2) is satisﬁed; we will prove (3). Without loss of
generality, we may replace C by D and thereby assume that C is an n-category. If n = −1, the desired result
follows immediately from Example 2.3.4.2. Choose m ≥ n and an element η ∈ πm(MapC(X, Y ), f ). We can
represent η by a commutative diagram of simplicial sets

∂ ∆m(cid:127)

/ {f }

∆m

s

/ HomR

C (X, Y ).

We can identify s with a map ∆m+1 → C whose restriction to ∂ ∆m+1 is speciﬁed. Since C is an n-category,
the inequality m + 1 > n shows that s is uniquely determined. This proves that πm(MapC(X, Y ), f ) ≃ ∗, so
that (3) is satisﬁed.

To prove that (3) implies (1), it suﬃces to show that if C is a minimal ∞-category which satisﬁes (3),
then C is an n-category. We must show that the conditions of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 are satisﬁed. The ﬁrst
of these conditions follows immediately from the assumption that C is minimal. For the second, we must
show that if m > n and f, f ′ : ∂ ∆m → C are such that f | ∂ ∆m = f ′| ∂ ∆m, then f = f ′. Since C is
minimal, it suﬃces to show that f and f ′ are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆m. We will prove that there is a map
g : ∆m+1 → C such that dm+1g = f , dmg = f ′, and dig = dismf = dismf ′ for 0 ≤ i < m. Then the sequence
(s0f, s1f, . . . , sm−1f, g) determines a map ∆m × ∆1 → C which gives the desired homotopy between f and
f ′ (relative to ∂ ∆m).

To produce the map g, it suﬃces to solve the lifting problem depicted in the diagram

e : (∆1)m ≃ MapC[∆m+1](X, Y ) → MapD(G0(X), G0(Y )).

The obstruction to constructing e lies in πm−1(MapD(G0(X), G0(Y )), p) for an appropriately chosen base
point p. Since (m − 1) > (n − 1), condition (3) implies that this homotopy set is trivial, so that the desired
extension can be found.

Corollary 2.3.4.19. Let X be a Kan complex. Then X is (categorically) equivalent to an n-category if and
only if it is n-truncated.

Proof. For n = −2 this is obvious. If n ≥ −1, this follows from characterization (3) of Proposition 2.3.4.18
and the following observation: a Kan complex X is n-truncated if and only if, for every pair of vertices
x, y ∈ X0, the Kan complex

{x} ×X X ∆1

×X {y}

of paths from x to y is (n − 1)-truncated.

Corollary 2.3.4.20. Let C be an ∞-category and K a simplicial set. Suppose that, for every pair of objects
C, D ∈ C, the space MapC(C, D) is n-truncated. Then the ∞-category Fun(K, C) has the same property.

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.3.4.18 and Corollary 2.3.4.8, since the functor

preserves categorical equivalences between ∞-categories.

2.4 Cartesian Fibrations

Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Each ﬁber of p is an ∞-category, and each edge
f : s → s′ of S determines a correspondence between the ﬁbers Xs and Xs′. In this section, we would like
to study the case in which each of these correspondences is associated to a functor f ∗ : Xs′ → Xs. Roughly
speaking, we can attempt to construct f ∗ as follows: for each vertex y ∈ Xs′ , we choose an edge
f : x → y
lifting f , and set f ∗y = x. However, this recipe does not uniquely determine x, even up to equivalence, since
there might be many diﬀerent choices for
f . More
f . To get a good theory, we need to make a good choice of
e
f be a p-Cartesian edge of X. In §2.4.1, we will introduce the deﬁnition of
precisely, we should require that
p-Cartesian edges and study their basic properties. In particular, we will see that a p-Cartesian edge
f is
determined up to equivalence by its target y and its image in S. Consequently, if there is a suﬃcient supply
of p-Cartesian edges of X, then we can use the above prescription to deﬁne the functor f ∗ : Xs′ → Xs. This
leads us to the notion of a Cartesian ﬁbration, which we will study in §2.4.2.

In §2.4.3, we will establish a few basic stability properties of the class of Cartesian ﬁbrations (we will
discuss other results of this type in §3, after we have developed the language of marked simplicial sets). In
§2.4.4 we will show that if p : C → D is a Cartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, then we can reduce many
questions about C to similar questions about the base D and about the ﬁbers of p. This technique has
many applications, which we will discuss in §2.4.5 and §2.4.6. Finally, in §2.4.7, we will study the theory of
biﬁbrations, which is useful for constructing examples of Cartesian ﬁbrations.

2.4.1 Cartesian Morphisms
Let C and C′ be ordinary categories, and let M : Cop × C′ → Set be a correspondence between them. Suppose
that we wish to know whether or not M arises as the correspondence associated to some functor g : C′ → C.
This is the case if and only if, for each object C′ ∈ C′, we can ﬁnd an object C ∈ C and a point η ∈ M (C, C′)
having the property that the “composition with η” map

ψ : HomC(D, C) → M (D, C′)

is bijective, for all D ∈ C. Note that η may be regarded as a morphism in the category C ⋆M C′. We will say
that η is a Cartesian morphism in C ⋆M C′ if ψ is bijective for each D ∈ C. The purpose of this section is to
generalize this notion to the ∞-categorical setting and to establish its basic properties.

Deﬁnition 2.4.1.1. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Let f : x → y be an edge in X.
We shall say that f is p-Cartesian if the induced map

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration.

X/f → X/y ×S/p(y) S/p(f )

Remark 2.4.1.2. Let M be an ordinary category, and let p : N(M) → ∆1 be a map (automatically an
inner ﬁbration), and let f : x → y be a morphism in M which projects isomorphically onto ∆1. Then f is
p-Cartesian in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.4.1.1 if and only if it is Cartesian in the classical sense.

We now summarize a few of the formal properties of Deﬁnition 2.4.1.1:

Proposition 2.4.1.3.
p-Cartesian.

(1) Let p : X → S be an isomorphism of simplicial sets. Then every edge of X is

of simplicial sets, where p (and therefore also p′) is an inner ﬁbration. Let f be an edge of X ′. If q(f )
is p-Cartesian, then f is p′-Cartesian.

(3) Let p : X → Y and q : Y → Z be inner ﬁbrations, and let f : x′ → x be an edge of X such that p(f ) is

q-Cartesian. Then f is p-Cartesian if and only if f is (q ◦ p)-Cartesian.

Proof. Assertions (1) and (2) follow immediately from the deﬁnition. To prove (3), we consider the commu-
tative diagram

X/f

ψ′

'NNNNNNNNNNNN

ψ

X/x ×Z/(q◦p)(x) Z/(q◦p)(f )

ψ′′

4jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj

X/x ×Y/p(x) Y/p(f ).

The map ψ′′ is a pullback of

Y/p(f ) → Y/p(x) ×Z/(q◦p)(x) Z/(q◦p)(f )
and therefore a trivial ﬁbration, in view of our assumption that p(f ) is q-Cartesian. If ψ′ is a trivial ﬁbration,
it follows that ψ is a trivial ﬁbration as well, which proves the “only if” direction of (3).

For the converse, suppose that ψ is a trivial ﬁbration. Proposition 2.1.2.1 implies that ψ′ is a right
ﬁbration. According to Lemma 2.1.3.4, it will suﬃce to prove that the ﬁbers of ψ′ are contractible. Let t be
a vertex of X/x ×Y/p(x) Y/p(f ), and let K = (ψ′′)−1{ψ′′(t)}. Since ψ′′ is a trivial ﬁbration, K is a contractible
Kan complex. Since ψ is a trivial ﬁbration, the simplicial set (ψ′)−1K = ψ−1{ψ′′(t)} is also a contractible
Kan complex. It follows that the ﬁber of ψ′ over the point t is weakly contractible, as desired.

Remark 2.4.1.4. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Unwinding the deﬁnition, we see
that an edge f : ∆1 → X is p-Cartesian if and only if for every n ≥ 2 and every commutative diagram

In particular, we note that Proposition 1.2.4.3 may be restated as follows:

(∗) Let C be a ∞-category, and let p : C → ∆0 denote the projection from C to a point. A morphism φ of

C is p-Cartesian if and only if φ is an equivalence.

In fact, it is possible to strengthen assertion (∗) as follows:

Proposition 2.4.1.5. Let p : C → D be an inner ﬁbration between ∞-categories, and let f : C → C′ be a
morphism in C. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The morphism f is an equivalence in C.

(2) The morphism f is p-Cartesian and p(f ) is an equivalence in D.

Proof. Let q denote the projection from D to a point. We note that both (1) and (2) imply that p(f ) is an
equivalence in D, and therefore q-Cartesian by (∗). The equivalence of (1) and (2) now follows from (∗) and
the third part of Proposition 2.4.1.3.

Corollary 2.4.1.6. Let p : C → D be an inner ﬁbration between ∞-categories. Every identity morphism of
C (in other words, every degenerate edge of C) is p-Cartesian.

We now study the behavior of Cartesian edges under composition.

Proposition 2.4.1.7. Let p : C → D be an inner ﬁbration between simplicial sets, and let σ : ∆2 → C be a
2-simplex of C, which we will depict as a diagram

Suppose that g is p-Cartesian. Then f is p-Cartesian if and only if h is p-Cartesian.

Proof. We wish to show that the map

is a trivial ﬁbration if and only if

i0 : C/h → C/C2 ×D/p(C2)

D/p(h)

i1 : C/f → C/C1 ×D/p(C1)

D/p(f )

is a trivial ﬁbration. The dual of Proposition 2.1.2.1 implies that both maps are right ﬁbrations. Conse-
quently, by (the dual of) Lemma 2.1.3.4, it suﬃces to show that the ﬁbers of i0 are contractible if and only
if the ﬁbers of i1 are contractible.

For any simplicial subset B ⊆ ∆2, let XB = C/σ|B ×Dσ|B

D/σ. We note that XB is functorial in B, in
the sense that an inclusion A ⊆ B induces a map jA,B : XB → XA (which is a right ﬁbration, again by
Proposition 2.1.2.1). We note that j∆{2},∆{0,2} is the base change of i0 by the map D/p(σ) → D/p(h), and
that j∆{1},∆{0,1} is the base change of i1 by the map D/σ → D/p(f ). The maps

D/p(f ) ← D/p(σ) → D/p(h)

are both surjective on objects (in fact, both maps have sections). Consequently, it suﬃces to prove that
j∆{1},∆{0,1} has contractible ﬁbers if and only if j∆{2},∆{0,2} has contractible ﬁbers. Now we observe that the
compositions

X∆2 → X∆{0,2} → X∆{2}

X∆2 → XΛ2

1

→ X∆{1,2} → X∆{2}

coincide. By Proposition 2.1.2.5, jA,B is a trivial ﬁbration whenever the inclusion A ⊆ B is left anodyne.
we deduce that j∆{2},∆{0,2} is a trivial ﬁbration if and only if j∆{1,2},Λ2
is a trivial ﬁbration. Consequently,
it suﬃces to show that j∆{1,2},Λ2

is a trivial ﬁbration if and only if j∆{1},∆{0,1} is a trivial ﬁbration.

Since j∆{1,2},Λ2

is a pullback of j∆{1},∆{0,1}, the “if” direction is obvious. For the converse, it suﬃces to

show that the natural map

is surjective on vertices. But this map is a trivial ﬁbration, since the inclusion {1} ⊆ ∆{1,2} is left anodyne.

Our next goal is to reformulate the notion of a Cartesian morphism in a form which will be useful later.
For convenience of notation, we will prove this result in a dual form. If p : X → S is an inner ﬁbration
and f an edge of X, we will say that f is p-coCartesian if is Cartesian with respect to the morphism
pop : X op → Sop.

Proposition 2.1.2.6; in particular, the ﬁltration

X(n + 1) ⊆ . . . ⊆ X(0) = ∆n × ∆1

of ∆n × ∆1. We construct h|X(m) by descending induction on m. To begin, we set h|X(n + 1) = f . Now,
m ⊆ ∆m+1. If
for each m the space X(m) is obtained from X(m + 1) by pushout along a horn inclusion Λn+1
m > 0, the desired extension exists because p is an inner ﬁbration. If m = 0, the desired extension exists
because of the hypothesis that e is a p-coCartesian edge.

We now prove the “if” direction. Suppose that e satisﬁes the condition in the statement of the Proposition.
We wish to show that e is p-coCartesian. In other words, we must show that for every n ≥ 2 and every

Moreover, F ′ carries {0} × ∆1 to a degenerate edge; such an edge is automatically coCartesian (by Corollary
2.4.1.6, since S is an ∞-category), and therefore there exists an extension of F ′ to all of ∆n × ∆1 by the
ﬁrst part of the proof.

Remark 2.4.1.9. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets, x a vertex of X, and f : x′ → p(x) an
edge of S ending at p(x). There may exist many p-Cartesian edges f : x′ → x of X with p(f ) = f . However,
there is a sense in which any two such edges having the same target x are equivalent to one another. Namely,
any p-Cartesian edge f : x′ → x lifting f can be regarded as a ﬁnal object of the ∞-category X/x ×S/p(x) {f },
and is therefore determined up to equivalence by f and x.

We now spell out the meaning of Deﬁnition 2.4.1.1 in the setting of simplicial categories.

Proposition 2.4.1.10. Let F : C → D be a functor between simplicial categories. Suppose that C and D
are ﬁbrant, and that for every pair of objects C, C′ ∈ C, the associated map

is a Kan ﬁbration. Then:

MapC(C, C′) → MapD(F (C), F (C′))

(1) The associated map q : N(C) → N(D) is an inner ﬁbration between ∞-categories.

(2) A morphism f : C′ → C′′ in C is q-Cartesian if and only if, for every object C ∈ C, the diagram of

simplicial sets

MapC(C, C′)

MapC(C, C′′)

is homotopy Cartesian.

MapD(F (C), F (C′))

/ MapD(F (C), F (C′′))

Proof. Assertion (1) follows from Remark 1.1.5.11. Let f be a morphism in C. By deﬁnition, f : C′ → C′′
is q-Cartesian if and only if

θ : N(C)/f → N(C)/C ′′ ×N(D)/F (C′′ ) N(D)/F (f )

is a trivial ﬁbration. Since θ is a right ﬁbration between right ﬁbrations over C, f is q-Cartesian if and only
if for every object C ∈ C, the induced map

θC : {C} ×N(C) N(C)/f → {C} ×N(C) N(C)/C ′′ ×N(D)/F (C′′ ) N(D)/F (f )

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes. This is equivalent to the assertion that the diagram

N(C)/f ×C {C}

N(C)/C ′′ ×N(C) {C}

N(D)/F (f ) ×N(D) {F (C)}

/ N(D)/F (C ′′) ×N(D) {F (C)}

is homotopy Cartesian. In view of Theorem 1.1.5.13, this diagram is equivalent to the diagram of simplicial
sets

MapC(C, C′)

MapC(C, C′′)

This proves (2).

In some contexts, it will be convenient to introduce a slightly larger class of edges:

Deﬁnition 2.4.1.11. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration, and let e : ∆1 → X be an edge. We will say that
e is locally p-Cartesian if it is a p′-Cartesian edge of the ﬁber product X ×S ∆1, where p′ : X ×S ∆1 → ∆1
denotes the projection.

Remark 2.4.1.12. Suppose given a pullback diagram

if and only if its image f (e) is locally p-Cartesian.

We conclude with a somewhat technical result which will be needed in §3.1.1:

Proposition 2.4.1.13. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Let f : x → y be an edge of
X Suppose that there is a 3-simplex σ : ∆3 → X such that d1σ = s0f and d2σ = s1f . Suppose furthermore

2.4.2 Cartesian Fibrations

In this section, we will introduce the study of Cartesian ﬁbrations between simplicial sets. The theory
of Cartesian ﬁbrations is a generalization of the theory of right ﬁbrations studied in §2.1. Recall that if
f : X → S is a right ﬁbration of simplicial sets, then the ﬁbers {Xs}s∈S are Kan complexes, which depend
in a (contravariantly) functorial fashion on the choice of vertex s ∈ S. The condition that f be a Cartesian
ﬁbration has a similar ﬂavor: we still require that Xs depend functorially on s, but weaken the requirement
that Xs be a Kan complex; instead, we merely require that it is an ∞-category.

Deﬁnition 2.4.2.1. We will say that a map p : X → S of simplicial sets is a Cartesian ﬁbration if the
following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The map p is an inner ﬁbration.

(2) For every edge f : x → y of S and every vertex
f ) = f .

y of X with p(

y) = y, there exists a p-Cartesian edge

e
We say that p is a coCartesian ﬁbration if the opposite map pop : X op → Sop is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

e

e

e

e

e

If a general inner ﬁbration p : X → S associates to each vertex s ∈ S an ∞-category Xs and to each
edge s → s′ a correspondence from Xs to Xs′ , then p is Cartesian if each of these correspondences arise from
an (canonically determined) functor Xs′ → Xs. In other words, a Cartesian ﬁbration with base S ought to
be roughly the same thing as a contravariant functor from S into an ∞-category of ∞-categories, where the
morphisms are given by functors. One of the main goals of §3 is to give a precise formulation (and proof) of
this assertion.

Remark 2.4.2.2. Let F : C → C′ be a functor between (ordinary) categories. The induced map of simplicial
sets N(F ) : N(C) → N(C′) of simplicial sets is automatically an inner ﬁbration; it is Cartesian if and only if
F is a ﬁbration of categories in the sense of Grothendieck.

The following formal properties follow immediately from the deﬁnition:

Proposition 2.4.2.3.

(1) Any isomorphism of simplicial sets is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

(2) The class of Cartesian ﬁbrations between simplicial sets is stable under base change.

(3) A composition of Cartesian ﬁbrations is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

Recall that an ∞-category C is a Kan complex if and only if every morphism in C is an equivalence. We

now establish a relative version of this statement:

Proposition 2.4.2.4. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The map p is a Cartesian ﬁbration and every edge in X is p-Cartesian.

(2) The map p is a right ﬁbration.

(3) The map p is a Cartesian ﬁbration and every ﬁber of p is a Kan complex.

Proof. In view of Remark 2.4.1.4, the assertion that every edge of X is p-Cartesian is equivalent to the
n ⊆ ∆n for all n ≥ 2. The requirement that
assertion that p has the right lifting property with respect to Λn
p be a Cartesian ﬁbration further imposes the right lifting property with respect to Λ1
1 ⊆ ∆1. This proves
that (1) ⇔ (2).

Suppose that (2) holds. Since we have established that (2) implies (1), we know that p is Cartesian.
Furthermore, we have already seen that the ﬁbers of a right ﬁbration are Kan complexes. Thus (2) implies
(3).

We complete the proof by showing that (3) implies that every edge f : x → y of X is p-Cartesian. Since p
is a Cartesian ﬁbration, there exists a p-Cartesian edge f ′ : x′ → y with p(f ′) = p(f ). Since f ′ is p-Cartesian,
there exists a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → X which we may depict as a diagram

/ y,

where p(σ) = s0p(f ). Then g lies in the ﬁber Xp(x), and is therefore an equivalence (since Xp(x) is a Kan
complex). It follows that f is equivalent to f ′ as objects of X/y ×S/p(y) {p(f )}, so that f is p-Cartesian as
desired.

Corollary 2.4.2.5. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration. Let X ′ ⊆ X consist of all those simplices σ of
X such that every edge of σ is p-Cartesian. Then p|X ′ is a right ﬁbration.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that p|X ′ is an inner ﬁbration. It suﬃces to show that p|X ′ has the right lifting property
with respect to every horn inclusion Λn
i , 0 < i < n. If n > 2, then this follows immediately from the fact the
fact that p has the appropriate lifting property. If n = 2, then we must show that if f : ∆2 → X is such that
1 factors through X ′, then f factors through X ′. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.4.1.7.
f |Λ2
We now wish to complete the proof by showing that p is a right ﬁbration. According to Proposition
2.4.2.4, it suﬃces to prove that every edge of X ′ is p|X ′-Cartesian. This follows immediately from the
characterization given in Remark 2.4.1.4, since every edge of X ′ is p-Cartesian when regarded as an edge of
X.

In order to verify that certain maps are Cartesian ﬁbrations, it often convenient to work in a slightly

more general setting.

Deﬁnition 2.4.2.6. A map p : X → S of simplicial sets is a locally Cartesian ﬁbration if it is an inner
ﬁbration and, for every edge ∆1 → S, the pullback X ×S ∆1 → ∆1 is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

In other words, an inner ﬁbration p : X → S is a locally Cartesian ﬁbration if and only if, for every

vertex x ∈ X and every edge e : s → p(x) in S, there exists a locally p-Cartesian edge s → x which lifts e.

Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. It is clear that every p-Cartesian morphism of
X is locally p-Cartesian. Moreover, Proposition 2.4.1.7 implies that the class of p-Cartesian edges of X is
stable under composition. Then following result can be regarded as a sort of converse:

case where S = ∆2. In this case, g is locally p-Cartesian if and only if it is p-Cartesian, and likewise for h.
We now conclude by applying Proposition 2.4.1.7.

The implication (2) ⇒ (3) is obvious. We conclude by showing that (3) ⇒ (1). We must show that
η : X/f → X/x ×S/p(x) S/p(f ) is a trivial ﬁbration. Since η is a right ﬁbration, it will suﬃce to show
that the ﬁber of η over any vertex is contractible. Any such vertex determines a map σ : ∆2 → S with
σ|∆{1,2} = p(f ). Pulling back via σ, we may suppose that S = ∆2.

It will be convenient to introduce a bit of notation: for every map q : K → X, let Y/q ⊆ X/q denote
the full simplicial subset spanned by those vertices of X/q which map to the initial vertex of S. We wish to
show that the natural map Y/f → Y/x is a trivial ﬁbration. By assumption, there exists a locally p-Cartesian
morphism g : x′′ → x′ in X covering the edge ∆{0,1} ⊆ S. Since X is an ∞-category, there exists a 2-simplex
τ : ∆2 → X with d2(τ ) = g and d0(τ ) = f . Then h = d1(τ ) is a composite of f and g, and assumption (3)
guarantees that h is locally p-Cartesian. We have a commutative diagram

Moreover, all of these maps in this diagram are trivial ﬁbrations except possibly ζ, which is known to be a
right ﬁbration. It follows that ζ is a trivial ﬁbration as well, which completes the proof.

In fact, we have the following:

Proposition 2.4.2.8. Let p : X → S be a locally Cartesian ﬁbration. The following conditions are equiva-
lent:

(1) The map p is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

if f and g are locally p-Cartesian, then h is locally p-Cartesian.

(3) Every locally p-Cartesian edge of X is p-Cartesian.

Proof. The equivalence (2) ⇔ (3) follows from Lemma 2.4.2.7, and the implication (3) ⇒ (1) is obvious. To
prove that (1) ⇒ (3), let us suppose that e : x → y is a locally p-Cartesian edge of X. Choose a p-Cartesian
edge e′ : x′ → y lifting p(e). The edges e and e′ are both p′-Cartesian in X ′ = X ×S ∆1, where p′ : X ′ → ∆1
denotes the projection. It follows that e and e′ are equivalent in X ′, and therefore also equivalent in X.
Since e′ is p-Cartesian, we deduce that e is p-Cartesian as well.

Remark 2.4.2.9. If p : X → S is a locally Cartesian ﬁbration, then we can associate to every edge s → s′

functors.

Corollary 2.4.2.10. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Then p is Cartesian if and only
if every pullback X ×S ∆n → ∆n is a Cartesian ﬁbration, for n ≤ 2.

Proof. Suppose given a vertex x′′ ∈ X and an edge e0 : y → p(x′′) in Y . It is clear that we can construct
a 2-simplex σ in X satisfying (i) through (iii), with p(e) = q(e0). Moreover, σ is uniquely determined up
to equivalence. We will prove that e is locally r-Cartesian. This will prove that r is a locally Cartesian
ﬁbration, and the “if” direction of the ﬁnal assertion. The converse will then follow from the uniqueness (up
to equivalence) of locally r-Cartesian lifts of a given edge (with speciﬁed terminal vertex).

To prove that e is locally r-Cartesian, we are free to pull back by the edge p(e) : ∆1 → S, and thereby
reduce to the case S = ∆1. Then p and q are Cartesian ﬁbrations. Since e′′ is p-Cartesian and r(e′′) is
q-Cartesian, Proposition 2.4.1.3 implies that e′′ is r-Cartesian. Remark 2.4.1.12 implies that e′ is locally
p-Cartesian. It follows from Lemma 2.4.2.7 that e is locally p-Cartesian as well.

Remark 2.4.2.12. The analogue of Proposition 2.4.2.11 for Cartesian ﬁbrations is false.

2.4.3 Stability Properties of Cartesian Fibrations

In this section, we will prove the class of Cartesian ﬁbrations is stable under the formation of overcategories
and undercategories. Since the deﬁnition of a Cartesian ﬁbration is not self-dual, we must treat these results
separately, using slightly diﬀerent arguments (Propositions 2.4.3.2 and 2.4.3.3). We begin with the following
simple lemma.

Lemma 2.4.3.1. Let A ⊆ B be an inclusion of simplicial sets. Then the inclusion

({1} ⋆ B)

(∆1 ⋆ A) ⊆ ∆1 ⋆ B

a{1}⋆A

is inner anodyne.

Proof. Working by transﬁnite induction, we may reduce to the case where B is obtained from A by adjoining
a single non-degenerate simplex, and therefore to the universal case B = ∆n, A = ∂ ∆n. Now the inclusion
in question is isomorphic to Λn+2

1 ⊆ ∆n+2.

Proposition 2.4.3.2. Let p : C → D be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and let q : K → C be a
diagram. Then:

(1) The induced map p′ : C/q → D/pq is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

(2) An edge f of C/q is p′-Cartesian if and only if the image of f in C is p-Cartesian.

Proof. Proposition 2.1.2.5 implies that p′ is an inner ﬁbration. Let us call an edge f of Cq/ special if its
image in C is pCartesian. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that:

(i) Given a vertex q ∈ C/q and an edge

f : r′ → p′(q), there exists a special edge f : r → q with p′(f ) =

(K ′, GK ′ ) ≤ (K ′′, GK ′′ ) if K ′ ⊆ K ′′ and GK ′ is a restriction of GK ′′ . Invoking Zorn’s lemma, we deduce
the existence of a maximal element (K ′, GK ′) of P . If K ′ = K, then the proof is complete. Otherwise, it
is possible to enlarge K ′ by adjoining a single nondegenerate m-simplex of K. Since (K ′, GK ′′ ) is maximal,
we conclude that the associated lifting problem

(2) An edge f of C/q is p′-coCartesian if and only if the image of f in C is p-coCartesian.

image in C is p-coCartesian. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that:

and therefore contains a maximal element (L, fL). If L 6= K, then we can choose a simplex σ : ∆n → K of

2.4.4 Mapping Spaces and Cartesian Fibrations

Let p : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories, and let X and Y be objects of C. Then p induces a map

φ : MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(p(X), p(Y )).

Our goal in this section is to understand the relationship between the ﬁbers of p and the homotopy ﬁbers of
φ.

Lemma 2.4.4.1. Let p : C → D be an inner ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let X, Y ∈ C. The induced map
φ : HomR

D(p(X), p(Y )) is a Kan ﬁbration.

C (X, Y ) → HomR

Proof. Since p is an inner ﬁbration, the induced map
Proposition 2.1.2.1. We note that φ is obtained from
Thus φ is a right ﬁbration; since the target of φ is a Kan complex, φ is a Kan ﬁbration by Lemma 2.1.3.3.

φ : C/X → D/p(X) ×D C is a right ﬁbration by
φ by restricting to the ﬁber over the vertex Y of C.

e

e
Suppose the conditions of Lemma 2.4.4.1 are satisﬁed. Let us consider the problem of computing the ﬁber
D(X, Y ). Suppose that there is a p-Cartesian edge e : X ′ → Y

of φ over a vertex e : p(X) → p(Y ) of HomR
lifting e. By deﬁnition, we have a trivial ﬁbration

ψ : C/e → C/Y ×D/p(Y )

D/e .

Consider the 2-simplex σ = s1(e), regarded as a vertex of D/e. Passing to the ﬁber, we obtain a trivial
ﬁbration

F → φ−1(e),

where F denotes the ﬁber of C/e → D/e ×D C over the point (σ, X). On the other hand, we have a trivial
C/X ′ by Proposition 2.1.2.5. Passing to the ﬁber again, we obtain a trivial
ﬁbration C/e → D/e ×D/p(X)
ﬁbration F → HomR

(X, X ′). We may summarize the situation as follows:

Cp(X)

Proposition 2.4.4.2. Let p : C → D be an inner ﬁbration of ∞-categories. Let X, Y ∈ C, let e : p(X) →
p(Y ) be a morphism in D, and let e : X ′ → Y be a locally p-Cartesian morphism of C lifting e. Then in the
homotopy category H of spaces, there is a ﬁber sequence

MapCp(X) (X, X ′) → MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(p(X), p(Y )).

Here the ﬁber is taken over the point classiﬁed by e : p(X) → p(Y ).

Proof. The edge e deﬁnes a map ∆1 → D. Note that the ﬁber of the Kan ﬁbration HomR
C (X, Y ) →
HomR
D(pX, pY ) does not change if we replace p by the induced projection C ×D∆1 → ∆1. We may therefore
assume without loss of generality that e is p-Cartesian, and the desired result follows from the above analysis.

A similar assertion can be taken as a characterization of Cartesian morphisms:

Proposition 2.4.4.3. Let p : C → D be an inner ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let f : Y → Z be a morphism
in C. The following are equivalent:

(1) The morphism f is p-Cartesian.

(2) For every object X of C, composition with f gives rise to a homotopy Cartesian diagram

MapC(X, Y )

MapC(X, Z)

MapD(p(X), p(Y ))

/ MapD(p(X), p(Z)).

D/p(f ) be the canonical map; then (1) is equivalent to the assertion that
Proof. Let φ : C/f → C/Z ×D/p(Z)
φ is a trivial ﬁbration. According to Proposition 2.1.2.1, φ is a right ﬁbration. Thus, φ is a trivial ﬁbration
if and only if the ﬁbers of φ are contractible Kan complexes. For each object X ∈ C, let

φX : C/f ×C{X} → C/Z ×D/p(Z)

D/p(f ) ×C{X}

be the induced map. Then φX is a right ﬁbration between Kan complexes, and therefore a Kan ﬁbration;
it has contractible ﬁbers if and only if it is a homotopy equivalence. Thus, (1) is equivalent to the assertion
that φX is a homotopy equivalence for every object X of C.

We remark that (2) is somewhat imprecise: although all the maps in the diagram are well deﬁned in
the homotopy category H of spaces, we need to represent this by a commutative diagram in the category of
simplicial sets before we can ask whether or not the diagram is homotopy Cartesian. We therefore rephrase
(2) more precisely: it asserts that the diagram of Kan complexes

C/f ×C{X}

C/Z ×C{X}

D/p(f ) ×D{p(X)}

/ D/p(Z) ×D{p(X)}

is homotopy Cartesian. Lemma 2.4.4.1 implies that the right vertical map is a Kan ﬁbration, so the homotopy
limit in question is given by the ﬁber product

C/Z ×D/p(Z)

D/p(f ) ×C{X}.

Consequently, assertion (2) is also equivalent to the condition that φX be a homotopy equivalence for every
object X ∈ C.

Corollary 2.4.4.4. Suppose given maps C p
→ E of ∞-categories, such that both q and q ◦ p are locally
Cartesian ﬁbrations. Suppose that p carries locally (q ◦ p)-Cartesian edges of C to locally q-Cartesian edges
of D, and that for every object Z ∈ E, the induced map CZ → DZ is a categorical equivalence. Then p is a
categorical equivalence.

→ D q

Proof. Proposition 2.4.4.2 implies that p is fully faithful. If Y is any object of D, then Y is equivalent in
the ﬁber Dq(Y ) to the image under p of some vertex of Cq(Y ). Thus p is essentially surjective and the proof
is complete.

Corollary 2.4.4.5. Let p : C → D be a Cartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories. Let q : D′ → D be a categorical
equivalence of ∞-categories. Then the induced map q′ : C′ = D′ ×D C → C is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. Proposition 2.4.4.2 immediately implies that q′ is fully faithful. We claim that q′ is essentially
surjective. Let X be any object of C. Since q is fully faithful, there exists an object y of T ′ and an
equivalence e : q(Y ) → p(X). Since p is Cartesian, we can choose a p-Cartesian edge e : Y ′ → X lifting e.
Since e is p-Cartesian and p(e) is an equivalence, e is an equivalence. By construction, the object Y ′ of S
lies in the image of q′.

Corollary 2.4.4.6. Let p : C → D be a Cartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories. Then p is a categorical
equivalence if and only if p is a trivial ﬁbration.

Proof. The “if” direction is clear. Suppose then that p is a categorical equivalence. We ﬁrst claim that p
is surjective on objects. The essential surjectivity of p implies that for each Y ∈ D there is an equivalence
Y → p(X), for some object X of C. Since p is Cartesian, this equivalence lifts to a p-Cartesian edge
Y → X
of S, so that p(

Y ) = Y .

Since p is fully faithful, the map MapC(X, X ′) → MapD(p(X), p(X ′)) is a homotopy equivalence for any
pair of objects X, X ′ ∈ C. Suppose that p(X) = p(X ′). Then, applying Proposition 2.4.4.2, we deduce
that MapCp(X) (X, X ′) is contractible. It follows that the ∞-category Cp(X) is nonempty with contractible
morphism spaces; it is therefore a contractible Kan complex. Proposition 2.4.2.4 now implies that p is a
right ﬁbration. Since p has contractible ﬁbers, it is a trivial ﬁbration by Lemma 2.1.3.4.

e

e

We have already seen that if a ∞-category S has an initial object, then that initial object is essentially

unique. We now establish a relative version of this result.

Lemma 2.4.4.7. Let p : C → D be a Cartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let C be an object of C. Suppose
that D = p(C) is an initial object of D, and that C is an initial object of the ∞-category CD = C ×D{D}.
Then C is an initial object of C.

Proof. Let C′ be any object of C, and let D′ = p(C′). Since D is an initial object of D, the space MapD(D, D′)
is contractible. In particular, there exists a morphism f : D → D′ in D. Let
D → C′ be a p-Cartesian
lift of f . According to Proposition 2.4.4.2, there exists a ﬁber sequence in the homotopy category H:

f :

MapCD (C,

D) → MapC(C, C′) → MapD(D, D′).

e

e

Since the ﬁrst and last space in the sequence are contractible, we deduce that MapC(C, C′) is contractible
e
as well, so that C is an initial object of C.

where p is a Cartesian ﬁbration and n > 0. Suppose that f0(0) is an initial object of the ∞-category
Xg(0) = X ×S {g(0)}. Then there exists a map f : ∆n → S as indicated by the dotted arrow in the diagram,
which renders the diagram commutative.

Proof. Pulling back via g, we may replace S by ∆n and thereby reduce to the case where S is an ∞-category
and g(0) is an initial object of S. It follows from Lemma 2.4.4.7 that f0(v) is an initial object of S, which
implies the existence of the desired extension f .

Proposition 2.4.4.9. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Assume that, for each
vertex s of S, the ∞-category Xs = X ×S {s} has an initial object.

(1) Let X ′ ⊆ X denote the full simplicial subset of X spanned by those vertices x which are initial objects

of Xp(x). Then p|X ′ is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

(2) Let C = MapS(S, X) be the ∞-category of sections of p. An arbitrary section q : S → X is an initial

object of C if and only if q factors through X ′.

Proof. Since every ﬁber Xs has an initial object, the map p|X ′ has the right lifting property with respect
to the inclusion ∅ ⊆ ∆0. If n > 0, then Lemma 2.4.4.8 shows that p|X ′ has the right lifting property with
respect to ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n. This proves (1). In particular, we deduce that there exists a map q : S → X ′ which
is a section of p. In view of the uniqueness of initial objects, (2) will follow if we can show that q is an initial
object of C. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we must show that for n > 0, any lifting problem

2.4.5 Application: Invariance of Undercategories

Our goal in this section is to complete the proof of Proposition 1.2.9.3 by proving the following assertion:

(∗) Let p : C → D be an equivalence of ∞-categories, and let j : K → C be a diagram. Then the induced

map

is a categorical equivalence.

We will need a lemma.

Cj/ → Dpj/

Lemma 2.4.5.1. Let p : C → D be a fully faithful map of ∞-categories, and let j : K → C be any diagram
in C. Then, for any object x of C, the map of Kan complexes

Cj/ ×C{x} → Dpj/ ×D{p(x)}

is a homotopy equivalence.

Proof. For any map r : K ′ → K of simplicial sets, let Cr = Cjr/ ×C{x} and Dr = Dpjr/ ×D{p(x)}.

Choose a transﬁnite sequence of simplicial subsets Kα of K, such that Kα+1 is the result of adjoining a
α<λ Kα whenever λ is a limit ordinal (we include the case

single nondegenerate simplex to Kα, and Kλ =
where λ = 0, so that K0 = ∅). Let iα : Kα → K denote the inclusion. We claim the following:

S
(1) For every ordinal α, the map φα : Ciα → Diα is a homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

(2) For every pair of ordinals β ≤ α, the maps Ciα → Ciβ and Diα → Diβ are Kan ﬁbrations of simplicial

sets.

We prove both of these claims by induction on α. When α = 0, (2) is obvious and (1) follows since both
sides are isomorphic to ∆0. If α is a limit ordinal, (2) is again obvious, while (1) follows from the fact that
both Ciα and Diα are obtained as the inverse limit of a transﬁnite sequence of ﬁbrations, and the map φα
is an inverse limit of maps which are individually homotopy equivalences.
Assume that α = β + 1 is a successor ordinal, so that Kα ≃ Kβ

∂ ∆n ∆n. Let f : ∆n → Kα be the

induced map, so that

Ciα = Ciβ ×Cf | ∂ ∆n Cf

Diα = Diβ ×Df | ∂ ∆n Df .

We note that the projections Cf → Df | ∂ ∆n and Cf → Df | ∂ ∆n are left ﬁbrations by Proposition 2.1.2.1,
and therefore Kan ﬁbrations by Lemma 2.1.3.3. This proves (2), since the class of Kan ﬁbrations is stable
under pullback. We also note that the pullback diagrams deﬁning Xiα and Yiα are also homotopy pullback
diagrams. Thus, to prove that φα is a homotopy equivalence, it suﬃces to show that φβ and the maps

Cf | ∂ ∆n → Df | ∂ ∆n

Cf → Df

are homotopy equivalences. In other words, we may reduce to the case where K is a ﬁnite complex.

We now work by induction on the dimension of K. Suppose that the dimension of K is n, and that the
result is known for all simplicial sets having smaller dimension. Running through the above argument again,
we can reduce to the case where K = ∆n. Let v denote the ﬁnal vertex of ∆n. By Proposition 2.1.2.5, the
maps

Cj → Cj|{v}

Dj → Dj|{v}

are trivial ﬁbrations. Thus, it suﬃces to consider the case where K is a single point {v}. In this case, we have
Cj = HomL
D(p(j(v)), p(x)). It follows that the map φ is a homotopy equivalence,
since p is assumed fully faithful.

C(j(v), x) and Yj = HomL

Proof of (∗). Let p : C → D be a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories, and j : K → C any diagram. We
have a factorization

Lemma 2.4.5.1 implies that Cj/ and Dpj/ ×D C are ﬁberwise equivalent left-ﬁbrations over C, so that f is a
categorical equivalence by Corollary 2.4.4.4 (we note that the map f automatically carries coCartesian edges
to coCartesian edges, since all edges of the target Dpj/ ×D C are coCartesian). The map g is a categorical
equivalence by Corollary 2.4.4.5. It follows that g ◦ f is a categorical equivalence, as desired.

Our main goal in this section is to prove the following result:

Theorem 2.4.6.1. Let C be a simplicial set. Then C is ﬁbrant for the Joyal model structure if and only if
C is an ∞-category.

The proof will require a few technical preliminaries.

Lemma 2.4.6.2. Let p : C → D be a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories and m ≥ 2 an integer. Suppose
given maps f0 : ∂ ∆{1,...,m} → C and h0 : Λm
0 → D with h0| ∂ ∆{1,...,m} = p ◦ f0. Suppose further that the
restriction of h to ∆{0,1} is an equivalence in D. Then there exist maps f : ∆{1,...,m} → C, h : ∆m → D,
with h|∆{1,...,n} = p ◦ f , f0 = f | ∂ ∆{1,...,m}, h0 = h|Λm
0 .

Proof. We may regard h0 as a point of the simplicial set D/p◦f0 . Since p is a categorical equivalence,
Proposition 1.2.9.3 implies that p′ : C/f0 → D/p◦f0 is a categorical equivalence. It follows that h0 lies in
the essential image of p′. Consider the linearly ordered set {0 < 0′ < 1 < . . . < n} and the corresponding
simplex ∆{0,0′,...,n}. By hypothesis, we can extend f0 to a map f ′
→ C and h0 to a map
0 : ∆{0,0′} ⋆ ∂ ∆{1,...,m} → D such that h′

0|∆{0′,1} is an equivalence in C. Proposition
0 determines a map

Lemma 2.4.6.3. Let p : C → D be a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories and A ⊆ B any inclusion of
simplicial sets. Let f0 : A → C, g : B → D be any maps, and let h0 : A × ∆1 → D be an equivalence from
g|A to p ◦ f0. Then there exists a map f : B → C and an equivalence h : B × ∆1 → D from g to p ◦ f , such
that f0 = f |A and h0 = h|A × ∆1.

Proof. Working cell-by-cell with the inclusion A ⊆ B, we may reduce to the case where B = ∆n, A = ∂ ∆n.
If n = 0, the existence of the desired extensions is a reformulation of the assumption that p is essentially
surjective. Let us assume therefore that n ≥ 1.

We consider the task of constructing h : ∆n × ∆1 → D. Consider the ﬁltration

X(n + 1) ⊆ . . . ⊆ X(0) = ∆n × ∆1

described in the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6. We note that the value of h on X(n + 1) is uniquely prescribed
by h0 and g. We extend the deﬁnition of h to X(i) by descending induction on i. We note that X(i) ≃
∆n+1. For i > 0, the existence of the required extension is guaranteed by the assumption
X(i + 1)
that D is an ∞-category. Since n ≥ 1, Lemma 2.4.6.2 allows us to extend h over the simplex σ0 and to
deﬁne f so that the desired conditions are satisﬁed.

Lemma 2.4.6.4. Let C ⊆ D be an inclusion of simplicial sets which is also a categorical equivalence. Suppose
further that C is an ∞-category. Then C is a retract of D.

Proof. Enlarging D by an inner anodyne extension if necessary, we may suppose that D is an ∞-category.
We now apply Lemma 2.4.6.3 in the case where A = C, B = D.

Proof of Theorem 2.4.6.1. The “only if” direction has already been established (Remark 2.2.5.5). For the
converse, we must show that if C is an ∞-category, then C has the extension property with respect to every
inclusion of simplicial sets A ⊆ B which is a categorical equivalence. Fix any map A → C. Since the Joyal
model structure is left-proper, the inclusion C ⊆ C
A B is a categorical equivalence. We now apply Lemma
2.4.6.4 to conclude that C is a retract of C
A B.

We can state Theorem 2.4.6.1 as follows: if S is a point, then p : X → S is a categorical ﬁbration (in
other words, a ﬁbration with respect to the Joyal model structure on S) if and only if it is an inner ﬁbration.
However, the class of inner ﬁbrations does not coincide with the class of categorical ﬁbrations in general.
The following result describes the situation when T is an ∞-category:

`

Corollary 2.4.6.5 (Joyal). Let p : C → D be a map of simpicial sets, where D is an ∞-category. Then p
is a categorical ﬁbration if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The map p is an inner ﬁbration.

(2) For every equivalence f : D → D′ in D, and every object C ∈ C with p(C) = D, there exists an

equivalence f : C → C′ in C with p(f ) = f .

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that p is a categorical ﬁbration. Then (1) follows immediately (since the inclusions
i ⊆ ∆n are categorical equivalences for 0 < i < n). To prove (2), we let D0 denote the largest Kan
Λn
complex contained in D, so that the edge f belongs to D. There exists a contractible Kan complex K
D′ and a map q : K → D such that q(
D} ⊆ K is a

indicated which renders the diagram commutative. We ﬁrst observe that condition (1), together with our
assumption that D is an ∞-category, guarantee that C is an ∞-category. Applying Theorem 2.4.6.1, we can
extend g0 to a map g′ : B → C, not necessarily satisfying h = p ◦ g′. Nevertheless, the maps h and p ◦ g′
have the same restriction to A. Let

H0 : (B × ∂ ∆1)

(A × ∆1) → D

aA×∂ ∆1

be given by (p ◦ g′, h) on B × ∂ ∆1, and by the composition

A × ∆1 → A ⊆ B h→ D

on A × ∆1. Applying Theorem 2.4.6.1 once more, we deduce that H0 extends to a map H : B × ∆1 → D.
The map H carries {a} × ∆1 to an equivalence in D, for every vertex a of A. Since the inclusion A ⊆ B is
a categorical equivalence, we deduce that H carries {b} × ∆1 to an equivalence, for every b ∈ B.

Let

G0 : (B × {0})

(A × ∆1) → C

We construct the desired extension G working cell-by-cell on B. We start by applying assumption (2)
to construct the map G|{b} × ∆1 for every vertex b of B (that does not already belong to A); moreover, we
ensure that G|{b} × ∆1 is an equivalence in C.

2.4.7 Biﬁbrations

As we explained in §2.1.2, left ﬁbrations p : X → S can be thought of as covariant functors from S into an
∞-category of spaces. Similarly, right ﬁbrations q : Y → T can be thought of as contravariant functors from
T into an ∞-category of spaces. The purpose of this section is to introduce a convenient formalism which
encodes covariant and contravariant functoriality simultaneously.

Remark 2.4.7.1. The theory of biﬁbrations will not play an important role in the remainder of the book.
In fact, the only result from this section that we will actually use is Corollary 2.4.7.12, whose statement
makes no mention of biﬁbrations. A reader who is willing to take Corollary 2.4.7.12 on faith, or supply an
alternative proof, may safely omit the material covered in this section.

Deﬁnition 2.4.7.2. Let S, T , and X be simplicial sets, and p : X → S × T a map. We shall say that p is

such that πS ◦ f maps ∆{n−1,n} ⊆ ∆n to a degenerate edge of T , there exists a dotted arrow as
indicated, rendering the diagram commutative. Here πS denotes the projection S × T → S.

Remark 2.4.7.3. The condition that p be a biﬁbration is not a condition on p alone, but refers also to a
decomposition of the codomain of p as a product S × T . We note also that the deﬁnition is not symmetric
in S and T : instead, p : X → S × T is a biﬁbration if and only if pop : X op → T op × Sop is a biﬁbration.

Remark 2.4.7.4. Let p : X → S × T be a map of simplicial sets. If T = ∗, then p is a biﬁbration if and
only if it is a left ﬁbration. If S = ∗, then p is a biﬁbration if and only if it is a right ﬁbration.

Roughly speaking, we can think of a biﬁbration p : X → S ×T as a bifunctor from S ×T to an ∞-category

of spaces; the functoriality is covariant in S and contravariant in T .

Lemma 2.4.7.5. Let p : X → S × T be a biﬁbration of simplicial sets. Suppose that S is an ∞-category.
Then the composition q = πT ◦ p is a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Furthermore, an edge e of X is
q-Cartesian if and only if πS(p(e)) is an equivalence.

Proof. The map q is an inner ﬁbration, since it is a composition of inner ﬁbrations. Let us say that an
edge e : x → y of X is quasi-Cartesian if πS(p(e)) is degenerate in S. Let y ∈ X0 be any vertex of X, and
e : x → q(y) an edge of S. The pair (e, s0q(y)) is an edge of S × T whose projection to T is degenerate;
consequently, it lifts to a (quasi-Cartesian) edge e : x → y in X. It is immediate from Deﬁnition 2.4.7.2 that
any quasi-Cartesian edge of X is q-Cartesian. Thus, q is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

Now suppose that e is a q-Cartesian edge of X. Then e is equivalent to a quasi-Cartesian edge of X;
it follows easily that πS(p(e)) is an equivalence. Conversely, suppose that e : x → y is an edge of X and
that πS(p(e)) is an equivalence. We wish to show that e is q-Cartesian. Choose a quasi-Cartesian edge
e′ : x′ → y with q(e′) = q(e). Since e′ is q-Cartesian, there exists a simplex σ ∈ X2 with d0σ = e′, d1σ = e,
and q(σ) = s0q(e). Let f = d2(σ), so that πS(p(e′)) ◦ πS(p(f )) ≃ πSp(e) in the ∞-category S. We note that
f lies in the ﬁber Xq(x), which is left-ﬁbered over S; since f maps to an equivalence in S, it is an equivalence
in Xq(x). Consequently, f is q-Cartesian, so that e = e′ ◦ f is q-Cartesian as well.

q
Proposition 2.4.7.6. Let X

biﬁbrations, and that p induces a homotopy equivalence X(s,t) → Y(s,t) of ﬁbers over each vertex (s, t) of
S × T . Then p is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. By means of a standard argument (see the proof of Proposition 2.2.2.7) we may reduce to the case
where S and T are simplices; in particular, we may suppose that S and T are ∞-categories. Fix t ∈ T0, and
consider the map of ﬁbers pt : Xt → Yt. Both sides are left-ﬁbered over S × {t}, so that pt is a categorical
equivalence by (the dual of) Corollary 2.4.4.4. We may then apply Corollary 2.4.4.4 again (along with the
characterization of Cartesian edges given in Lemma 2.4.7.5) to deduce that p is a categorical equivalence.

Proposition 2.4.7.7. Let p : X → S × T be a biﬁbration, let f : S′ → S, g : T ′ → T be categorical
equivalences between ∞-categories, and let X ′ = X ×S×T (S′ × T ′). Then the induced map X ′ → X is a
categorical equivalence.

Proof. We will prove the result assuming that f is an isomorphism. A dual argument will establish the result
when g is an isomorphism, and applying the result twice we will deduce the desired statement for arbitrary
f and g.

Given a map i : A → S, let us say that i is good if the induced map X ×S×T (A × T ′) → X ×S×T (A × T ′)
is a categorical equivalence. We wish to show that the identity map S → S is good; it will suﬃce to show
that all maps A → S are good. Using the argument of Proposition 2.2.2.7, we can reduce to showing that
every map ∆n → S is good. In other words, we may assume that S = ∆n, and in particular that S is an
∞-category. By Lemma 2.4.7.5, the projection X → T is a Cartesian ﬁbration. The desired result now
follows from Corollary 2.4.4.5.

We next prove an analogue of Lemma 2.4.6.3.

q
Lemma 2.4.7.8. Let X
→ S × T satisfy the hypotheses of Proposition 2.4.7.6. Let A ⊆ B be a
coﬁbration of simplicial sets over S × T . Let f0 : A → X, g : B → Y be morphisms in (Set∆)/S×T and let
h0 : A × ∆1 → Y be a homotopy (again over S × T ) from g|A to p ◦ f0.

p
→ Y

Then there exists a map f : B → X (of simplicial sets over S × T ) and a homotopy h : B × ∆1 → T

(over S × T ) from g to p ◦ f , such that f0 = f |A and h0 = h|A × ∆1.

Proof. Working cell-by-cell with the inclusion A ⊆ B, we may reduce to the case where B = ∆n, A = ∂ ∆n.
If n = 0, we may invoke the fact that p induces a surjection π0X(s,t) → π0Y(s,t) on each ﬁber. Let us assume
therefore that n ≥ 1. Without loss of generality, we may pull back along the maps B → S, B → T , and
reduce to the case where S and T are simplices.

We consider the task of constructing h : ∆n × ∆1 → T . We now employ the ﬁltration

X(n + 1) ⊆ . . . ⊆ X(0)

described in the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6. We note that the value of h on X(n + 1) is uniquely prescribed
by h0 and g. We extend the deﬁnition of h to X(i) by descending induction on i. We note that X(i) ≃
∆n+1. For i > 0, the existence of the required extension is guaranteed by the assumption
X(i + 1)
that Y is inner-ﬁbered over S × T .

We note that, in view of the assumption that S and T are simplices, any extension of of h over the
simplex σ0 is automatically a map over S × T . Since S and T are ∞-categories, Proposition 2.4.7.6 implies
that p is a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories; the existence of the desired extension of h (and the map

Chapter 3

The ∞-Category of ∞-Categories

The power of category theory lies in its role as a unifying language for mathematics: nearly every class of
mathematical structures (groups, manifolds, algebraic varieties, etcetera) can be organized into a category.
This language is somewhat inadequate in situations where the structures need to be classiﬁed up to some
notion of equivalence less rigid than isomorphism. For example, in algebraic topology one wishes to study
topological spaces up to homotopy equivalence; in homological algebra one wishes to study chain complexes
up to quasi-isomorphism. Both of these examples are most naturally described in terms of higher category
theory (for example, the theory of ∞-categories developed in this book).

Another source of examples arises in category theory itself. In classical category theory, it is generally
regarded as unnatural to ask whether two categories are isomorphic; instead, one asks whether or not they
are equivalent. The same phenomenon arises in higher category theory. Throughout this book, we generally
regard two ∞-categories C and D as “the same” if they are categorically equivalent, even if they are not
isomorphic to one another as simplicial sets. In other words, we are not interested in the ordinary category
of ∞-categories (a full subcategory of Set∆), but in an underlying ∞-category which we now deﬁne.
Deﬁnition 3.0.0.1. The simplicial category Cat∆

∞ is deﬁned as follows:

(1) The objects of Cat∆

∞ are (small) ∞-categories.

(2) Given ∞-categories C and D, we deﬁne MapCat∆

∞

the ∞-category Fun(C, D).

(C, D) to be the largest Kan complex contained in

We let Cat∞ denote the simplicial nerve N(Cat∆

∞). We will refer to Cat∞ as the ∞-category of (small)

∞-categories.

Remark 3.0.0.2. By construction, Cat∞ arises as the nerve of a simplicial category Cat∆
∞, where composi-
tion is strictly associative. This is one advantage of working with ∞-categories: the correct notion of functor
is encoded by simply considering maps of simplicial sets (rather than homotopy coherent diagrams, say), so
there is no diﬃculty in composing them.

Remark 3.0.0.3. The mapping spaces in Cat∆

∞ are Kan complexes, so that Cat∞ is an ∞-category (Propo-

Remark 3.0.0.4. By construction, the objects of Cat∞ are ∞-categories, morphisms are given by functors,
and 2-morphisms are given by homotopies between functors. In other words, Cat∞ discards all information
about noninvertible natural transformations between functors. If necessary, we could retain this information
by forming an ∞-bicategory of (small) ∞-categories. We do not wish to become involved in any systematic
discussion of ∞-bicategories, so we will be content to consider only Cat∞.

Our goal in this chapter is to study the ∞-category Cat∞. For example, we would like to show that Cat∞
admits limits and colimits. There are two approaches to proving this assertion. We can attack the problem

124

directly, by giving an explicit construction of the limits and colimits in question: see §3.3.3 and §3.3.4.
Alternatively, we can try to realize Cat∞ as the ∞-category underlying a (simplicial) model category A, and
deduce the existence of limits and colimits in Cat∞ from the existence of homotopy limits and homotopy
colimits in A (Corollary 4.2.4.8). The objects of Cat∞ can be identiﬁed with the ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects
of Set∆, with respect to the Joyal model structure. However, we cannot apply Corollary 4.2.4.8 directly,
because the Joyal model structure on Set∆ is not compatible with its (usual) simplicial structure. We will
remedy this diﬃculty by introducing the category Set+
∆ of marked simplicial sets. We will explain how to
endow Set+
∆ with the structure of a simplicial model category in such a way that there is an equivalence of
simplicial categories Cat∆
∆)◦. This will allow us to identify Cat∞ with the ∞-category underlying
Set+

∆, so that Corollary 4.2.4.8 can be invoked.
We will introduce the formalism of marked simplicial sets in §3.1.

In particular, we will explain the
construction of a model structure not only on Set+
∆)/S of marked
simplicial sets over a given simplicial set S. The ﬁbrant objects of (Set+
∆)/S can be identiﬁed with Cartesian
ﬁbrations X → S, which we can think of as contravariant functors from S into Cat∞. In §3.2, we will justify
this intuition by introducing the straightening and unstraightening functors which will allow us to pass back
and forth between Cartesian ﬁbrations over S and functors from Sop to Cat∞. This correspondence has
applications to both the study of Cartesian ﬁbrations and to the study of the ∞-category Cat∞; we will
survey some of these applications in §3.3.

Remark 3.0.0.5. In the later chapters of this book, it will be necessary to undertake a systematic study
of ∞-categories which are not small. For this purpose, we introduce the following notational conventions:
Cat∞ will denote the simplicial nerve of the category of small ∞-categories, while
Cat∞ denotes the the
simplicial nerve of the category of ∞-categories which are not necessarily small.

3.1 Marked Simplicial Sets

The Joyal model structure on Set∆ is a powerful tool in the study of ∞-categories. However, in relative
situations it is somewhat inconvenient. Roughly speaking, a categorical ﬁbration p : X → S determines a
family of ∞-categories Xs, parametrized by the vertices s of S. However, we are generally more interested in
those cases where Xs can be regarded as a functor of s. As we explained in §2.4.2, this naturally translates
into the assumption that p is a Cartesian (or coCartesian) ﬁbration. According to Proposition 3.3.1.7, every
Cartesian ﬁbration is a categorical ﬁbration, but the converse is false. Consequently, it is natural to to try
to endow (Set∆)/S with some other model structure, in which the ﬁbrant objects are precisely the Cartesian
ﬁbrations over S.

Unfortunately, this turns out to be an unreasonable demand. In order to have a model category, we need
in other words, we need the ability to enlarge an arbitrary map

to be able to form ﬁbrant replacements:
p : X → S into a commutative diagram

where q is a Cartesian ﬁbration generated by p. A question arises: for which edges f of X should φ(f ) be
q-Cartesian edge of Y ? This sort of information is needed for the construction of Y ; consequently, we need
a formalism in which certain edges of X have been distinguished, or marked.

Deﬁnition 3.1.0.1. A marked simplicial set is a pair (X, E) where X is a simplicial set and E is a set of
edges of X which contains every degenerate edge. We will say that an edge of X will be called marked if it
belongs to E.

A morphism f : (X, E) → (X ′, E′) of marked simplicial sets is a map f : X → X ′ having the property

that f (E) ⊆ E′. The category of marked simplicial sets will be denoted by Set+
∆.

Every simplicial set S may be regarded as a marked simplicial set, usually in many diﬀerent ways. The
two extreme cases deserve special mention: if S is a simplicial set, we let S♯ = (S, S1) denote the marked
simplicial set in which every edge of S has been marked, and S♭ = (S, s0(S0)) the marked simplicial set in
which only the degenerate edges of S have been marked.

Notation 3.1.0.2. Let S be a simplicial set. We let (Set+
equipped with a map to S (which might otherwise be denoted as (Set+

∆)/S♯).

∆)/S denote the category of marked simplicial sets

Our goal in this section is to study the theory of marked simplicial sets, and in particular to endow each
(Set+
∆)/S with the structure of a model category. We will begin in §3.1.1 by introducing the notion of a
marked anodyne morphism in Set+
∆. In §3.1.2, we will establish a basic stability property of the class of
marked anodyne maps, which implies the stability of Cartesian ﬁbrations under exponentiation (Proposition
3.1.2.1). In §3.1.3 we will introduce the Cartesian model structure on (Set+
∆)/S, for every simplicial set S.
In §3.1.4, we will study these model categories; in particular, we will see that each (Set+
∆)/S is a simplicial
model category, whose ﬁbrant objects are precisely the Cartesian ﬁbrations X → S (with Cartesian edges
of X marked). Finally, we will conclude with §3.1.5, where we compare the Cartesian model structure on
(Set+
∆)/S with other model structures considered in this book (such as the Joyal and contravariant model
structures).

3.1.1 Marked Anodyne Morphisms
In this section, we will introduce the class of marked anodyne morphisms in Set+
∆. The deﬁnition is chosen
so that the condition that a map X → S have the right lifting property with respect to all marked anodyne
morphisms is closely related to the condition that the underlying map of simplicial sets X → S be a Cartesian

ﬁbration (we refer the reader to Proposition 3.1.1.6 for a more precise statement). The theory of marked
anodyne maps is a technical device which will prove useful when we discuss the Cartesian model structure
in §3.1.3: every marked anodyne morphism is a trivial coﬁbration with respect to the Cartesian model
structure, but not conversely. In this respect, the class of marked anodyne morphisms of Set+
∆ is analogous
to the class of inner anodyne morphisms of Set∆.

Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1. The class of marked anodyne morphisms in Set+

∆ is the smallest weakly saturated (see

(1) For each 0 < i < n, the inclusion (Λn

∆{n−1,n}.

(4) For every Kan complex K, the map K ♭ → K ♯ is marked anodyne.

Remark 3.1.1.2. The deﬁnition of a marked simplicial set is self-dual. However, Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1 is not
self-dual: if A → B is marked anodyne, then the opposite morphism Aop → Bop need not be marked-anodyne.
This reﬂects the fact that the theory of Cartesian ﬁbrations is not self-dual.

Remark 3.1.1.3. In part (4) of Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1, it suﬃces to allow K to range over a set of representatives
for all isomorphism classes of Kan complexes with only countably many simplices. Consequently, we deduce
that the class of marked anodyne morphisms in Set+
∆ is of small generation, so that the small object argument
applies (see §A.1.2). We will reﬁne this observation further: see Corollary 3.1.1.8, below.

Remark 3.1.1.4. In Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1, we are free to replace (1) by

(1′) For every inner anodyne map A → B of simplicial sets, the induced map A♭ → B♭ is marked anodyne.

Proposition 3.1.1.5. Consider the following classes of morphisms in Set+
∆:

(2) All inclusions

(Λn

n, E ∩(Λn

n)1) ⊆ (∆n, E),

where n > 0 and E denotes the set of all degenerate edges of ∆n, together with the ﬁnal edge ∆{n−1,n}.

(2′) All inclusions

(2′′) All inclusions

(A♭ × (∆1)♯)

(B♭ × {1}♯) ⊆ B♭ × (∆1)♯,

aA♭×{1}♯
where A ⊆ B is an inclusion of simplicial sets.

The classes (2′) and (2′′) generate the same weakly saturated class of morphisms of Set+

∆, which contains
the weakly saturated class generated by (2). Conversely, the weakly saturated class of morphisms generated
by (1) and (2) from Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1 contains (2′) and (2′′).

127

Proof. To see that each of the morphisms speciﬁed in (2′′) is contained in the weakly saturated class generated
by (2′), it suﬃces to work cell-by-cell with the inclusion A ⊆ B. The converse is obvious, since the class of
morphisms of type (2′) is contained in the class of morphisms of type (2′′). To see that the weakly saturated
class generated by (2′′) contains (2), it suﬃces to show every morphism in (2) is a retract of a morphism in
(2′′). For this, we consider maps

→ ∆n × ∆1 r
Here j is the composition of the identiﬁcation ∆n ≃ ∆n × {0} with the inclusion ∆n × {0} ⊆ ∆n × ∆1, and
r may be identiﬁed with the map of partially ordered sets

→ ∆n.

Now we simply observe that j and r exhibit the inclusion

((Λn

((∆n)♭ × {1}♯) ⊆ (∆n)♭ × (∆1)♯.

n)♭×{1}♯

a(Λn

To complete the proof, we must show that each of the inclusions

((∂ ∆n)♭ × (∆1)♯)

((∆n)♭ × {1}♯) ⊆ (∆n)♭ × (∆1)♯

a(∂ ∆n)♭×{1}♯

of type (2′) belongs to the weakly saturated class generated by (1) and (2). To see this, we consider the
ﬁltration

Yn+1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ Y0 = ∆n × ∆1
which is the opposite of the ﬁltration deﬁned in the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6. We let Ei denote the
class of all edges of Yi which are marked in (∆n)♭ × (∆1)♯.
It will suﬃce to show that each inclusion
fi : (Yi+1, Ei+1) ⊆ (Yi, Ei) lies in the weakly saturated class generated by (1) and (2). For i 6= 0, the map fi
is a pushout of (Λn+1

n+1−i)♭ ⊆ (∆n+1)♭. For i = 0, fi is a pushout of

(Λn+1

n+1, E ∩(Λn+1

n+1)1) ⊆ (∆n+1, E),

where and E denotes the set of all degenerate edges of ∆n+1, together with ∆{n,n+1}.

We now characterize the class of marked-anodyne maps:

Proposition 3.1.1.6. A map p : X → S in Set+
anodyne maps if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

∆ has the right lifting property with respect to all marked

(A) The map p is an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

(B) An edge e of X is marked if and only if p(e) is marked and e is p-Cartesian.

(C) For every object y of X and every marked edge e : x → p(y) in S, there exists a marked edge e : x → y

of X with p(e) = e.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove the “only if” direction. Suppose that p has the right lifting property with respect to
all marked anodyne maps. By considering maps of the form (1) from Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1, we deduce that (A)
holds. Considering (2) in the case n = 0, we deduce that (C) holds. Considering (2) for n > 0, we deduce
that every marked edge of X is p-Cartesian. For the converse, let us suppose that e : x → y is a p-Cartesian
edge of X and that p(e) is marked in S. Invoking (C), we deduce that there exists a marked edge e′ : x′ → y

128

with p(e) = p(e′). Since e′ is Cartesian, we can ﬁnd a 2-simplex σ of X with d0(σ) = e′, d1(σ) = e, and
p(σ) = s1p(e). Then d2(σ) an equivalence between x and x′ in the ∞-category Xp(x). Let K denote the
largest Kan complex contained in Xp(x). Since p has the right lifting property with respect to K ♭ → K ♯, we
deduce that every edge of K is marked; in particular, d2(σ) is marked. Since p has the right lifting property
with respect to the morphism described in (3) of Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1, we deduce that d1(σ) = e is marked.

Now suppose that p satisﬁed the hypotheses of the proposition. We must show that p has the right
lifting property with respect to the classes of morphisms (1), (2), (3), and (4) of Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1. For (1),
this follows from the assumption that p is an inner ﬁbration. For (2), this follows from (C) and from the
assumption that every marked edge is p-Cartesian. For (3), we are free to replace S by (∆2)♯; then p is a
Cartesian ﬁbration over an ∞-category S and we may apply Proposition 2.4.1.7 to deduce that the class of
p-Cartesian edges is stable under composition.

Finally, for (4), we may replace S by K ♯; then S is a Kan complex and p is a Cartesian ﬁbration, so the
p-Cartesian edges of X are precisely the equivalences in X. Since K is a Kan complex, any map K → X
carries the edges of K to equivalences in X.

By Quillen’s small object argument, we deduce that a map j : A → B in Set+

∆ is marked anodyne if and
only if it has the left lifting property with respect to all morphisms p : X → S satisfying the hypotheses of
Proposition 3.1.1.6. From this, we deduce:

Corollary 3.1.1.7. The inclusion

is marked anodyne.

i : (Λ2

2)♯

(∆2)♭ ֒→ (∆2)♯

a(Λ2
2)♭

Proof. It will suﬃce to show that i has the left lifting property with respect to any of the morphisms
p : X → S described in Proposition 3.1.1.6. Without loss of generality, we may replace S by (∆2)♯; we now
apply Proposition 2.4.1.7.

The following somewhat technical corollary will be needed in §3.1.3:

Corollary 3.1.1.8. In Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1, we can replace the class of morphisms (4) by

(4′) the map j : A♭ → (A, s0A0

{f }), where A is the quotient of ∆3 which co-represents the functor

HomSet∆(A, X) = {σ ∈ X3, e ∈ X1 : d1σ = s0e, d2σ = s1e}

S

and f ∈ A1 is the image of ∆{0,1} ⊆ ∆3 in A.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that for every Kan complex K, the map i : K ♭ → K ♯ lies in the weakly saturated class
of morphisms generated by (4′). We note that i can be obtained as an iterated pushout of morphisms having
the form K ♭ → (K, s0K0
{e}), where e is an edge of K. It therefore suﬃces to show that there exists a
map p : A → K such that p(f ) = e. In other words, we must prove that there exists a 3-simplex σ : ∆3 → K
with d1σ = s0e and d2σ = s1e. This follows immediately from the Kan extension condition.

S

To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the map j is marked anodyne. To do so, it suﬃces to

prove that for any diagram

Deﬁnition 3.1.1.9. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. We let X ♮ denote the marked
simplicial set (X, E), where E is the set of p-Cartesian edges of X.

Remark 3.1.1.10. Our notation is slightly abusive, since X ♮ depends not only on X but also on the map
X → S.

Remark 3.1.1.11. According to Proposition 3.1.1.6, a map (Y, E) → S♯ has the right lifting property with
respect to all marked anodyne maps if and only if the underlying map Y → S is a Cartesian ﬁbration and
(Y, E) = Y ♮.

We conclude this section with the following easy result, which will be needed later:

Proposition 3.1.1.12. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and let f : A → B be a
marked anodyne morphism in Set+
∆, let q : B → X be map of simplicial sets which carries each marked edge
of B to a p-Cartesian edge of X, and q0 = q ◦ f . Then the induced map

is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

X/q → X/q0 ×S/pq0

S/pq

Proof. It is easy to see that the class of all morphisms f of Set+
∆ which satisfy the desired conclusion is
weakly saturated. It therefore suﬃces to prove that this class contains collection of generators for the weakly
saturated class of marked anodyne morphisms. If f induces a left anodyne map on the underlying simplicial
sets, then the desired result is automatic. It therefore suﬃces to consider the case where f is the inclusion

as described in (2) of Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1. In this case, a lifting problem

3.1.2 Stability Properties of Marked Anodyne Morphisms

Our main goal in this section is to prove the following stability result:

Proposition 3.1.2.1. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and let K be an arbitrary
simplicial set. Then:

(1) The induced map pK : X K → SK is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

(2) An edge ∆1 → X K is pK-Cartesian if and only if, for every vertex k of K, the induced edge ∆1 → X

is p-Cartesian.

We could easily have given an ad-hoc proof of this result in §2.4.3. However, we have opted instead to

give a proof using the language of marked simplicial sets.

Deﬁnition 3.1.2.2. A morphism (X, E) → (X ′, E′) in Set+
of simplicial sets is a coﬁbration.

∆ is a coﬁbration if the underlying map X → X ′

The main ingredient we will need to prove Proposition 3.1.2.1 is the following:

Proposition 3.1.2.3. The class of marked anodyne maps in Set+
∆ is stable under smash products with
arbitrary coﬁbrations. In other words, if f : X → X ′ is marked anodyne, and g : Y → Y ′ is a coﬁbration,
then the induced map

is marked anodyne.

(X × Y ′)

(X ′ × Y ) → X ′ × Y ′

aX×Y

Proof. The argument is tedious, but straightforward. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that f
belongs either to the class (2′) of Proposition 3.1.1.5, or one of the classes speciﬁed in (1), (3), or (4) of
Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1. The class of coﬁbrations is generated by the inclusions (∂ ∆n)♭ ⊆ (∆n)♭ and (∆1)♭ ⊆ (∆1)♯;
thus we may suppose that g : Y → Y ′ is one of these maps. There are eight cases to consider:

(A1) Let f be the inclusion (Λn

i )♭ ⊆ (∆n)♭ and g the inclusion (∂ ∆n)♭ → (∆n)♭, where 0 < i < n. Since the
class of inner anodyne maps between simplicial sets is stable under smash products with inclusions,
the smash product of f and g is marked-anodyne (see Remark 3.1.1.4).

(A2) Let f denote the inclusion (Λn

i )♭ → (∆n)♭, and g the map (∆1)♭ → (∆1)♯, where 0 < i < n. Then the

smash product of f and g is an isomorphism (since Λn

i contains all vertices of ∆n).

(B1) Let f be the inclusion

({1}♯ × (∆n)♭)

((∆1)♯ × (∂ ∆n)♭) ⊆ (∆1)♯ × (∆n)♭,

a{1}♯×(∂ ∆n)♭

and let g be the inclusion (∂ ∆n)♭ → (∆n)♭. Then the smash product of f and g belongs to the class
(2′′) of Proposition 3.1.1.5.

(B2) Let f be the inclusion

({1}♯ × (∆n)♭)

((∆1)♯ × (∂ ∆n)♭) ⊆ (∆1)♯ × (∆n)♭,

a{1}♯×(∂ ∆n)♭

and let g denote the map (∆1)♭ → (∆1)♯. If n > 0, then the smash product of f and g is an isomorphism.
If n = 0, then the smash product may be identiﬁed with the map (∆1 × ∆1, E) → (∆1 × ∆1)♯, where
E consists of all degenerate edges together with {0} × ∆1, {1} × ∆1, and ∆1 × {1}. This map may be
obtained as a composition of two marked anodyne maps: the ﬁrst is of type (3) in Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1
(adjoining the “diagonal” edge to E) and the second is the map described in Corollary 3.1.1.7 (adjoining
the edge ∆1 × {0} to E).

(C1) Let f be the inclusion

(Λ2

(∆2)♭ → (∆2)♯,

and let g the inclusion (∂ ∆n)♭ ⊆ (∆n)♭. Then the smash product of f and g is an isomorphism for
n > 0, and isomorphic to f for n = 0.

(Λ2

(∆2)♭ → (∆2)♯,

and let g be the canonical map (∆1)♭ → (∆1)♯. Then the smash product of f and g is a pushout of the
map f .

(D1) Let f be the map K ♭ → K ♯, where K is a Kan complex, and let g the inclusion (∂ ∆n)♭ ⊆ (∆n)♭.
Then the smash product of f and g is an isomorphism for n > 0, and isomorphic to f for n = 0.

(D2) Let f be the map K ♭ → K ♯, where K is a Kan complex, and let g be the map (∆1)♭ → (∆1)♯. The

smash product of f and g can be identiﬁed with the inclusion

(K × ∆1, E) ⊆ (K × ∆1)♯,

where E denotes the class of all edges e = (e′, e′′) of K × ∆1 for which either e′
: ∆1 → K or
e′′ : ∆1 → ∆1 is degenerate. This inclusion can be obtained as a transﬁnite composition of pushouts
of the map

(Λ2

(∆2)♭ → (∆2)♯.

a(Λ2

We now return to our main objective:

Proof of Proposition 3.1.2.1. Since p is a Cartesian ﬁbration, it induces a map X ♮ → S♯ which has the right
lifting property with respect to all marked anodyne maps. By Proposition 3.1.2.3, the induced map

(X ♮)K ♭

→ (S♯)K ♭

= (SK)♯

has the right lifting property with respect to all marked anodyne morphisms. The desired result now follows
from Remark 3.1.1.11.

3.1.3 The Cartesian Model Structure

Let S be a simplicial set. Our goal in this section is to introduce the Cartesian model structure on the
category (Set+
∆)/S of marked simplicial sets over S. We will eventually show that the ﬁbrant objects of
(Set+
∆)/S correspond precisely to Cartesian ﬁbrations X → S, and that they encode (contravariant) functors
from S into the ∞-category Cat∞.

The category Set+

∆ is Cartesian-closed; that is, for any two objects X, Y ∈ Set+

∆, there exists an internal

mapping object Y X equipped with an “evaluation map” Y X × X → Y which induces bijections

HomSet+

(Z, Y X ) → HomSet+

∆

(Z × X, Y )

for every Z ∈ Set+
∆. We let Map♭(X, Y ) denote the underlying simplicial set of Y X , and Map♯(X, Y ) ⊆
Map♭(X, Y ) the simplicial subset consisting of all simplices σ ⊆ Map♭(X, Y ) such that every edge of σ is a
marked edge of Y X . Equivalently, we may describe these simplicial sets by the mapping properties

(1) The functor f is a categorical equivalence.

(2) For every simplicial set K, the induced map Fun(K, C) → Fun(K, D) is a categorical equivalence.

(3) For every simplicial set K, the functor Fun(K, C) → Fun(K, D) induces a homotopy equivalence between
the largest Kan complex contained in Fun(K, C) and the largest Kan complex contained in Fun(K, D).

Proof. The implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) are obvious. Suppose that (3) is satisﬁed. Let K = D. According
to (3), there exists an object x of Fun(K, C) whose image in Fun(K, D) is equivalent to the identity map
K → D. We may identify x with a functor g : D → C having the property that f ◦ g is homotopic to the
identity idD. It follows that g also has the property asserted by (3), so the same argument shows that there
is a functor f ′ : C → D such that g ◦ f ′ is homotopic to idC. It follows that f ◦ g ◦ f ′ is homotopic to
both f and f ′, so that f is homotopic to f ′. Thus g is a homotopy inverse to f , which proves that f is an
equivalence.

Proposition 3.1.3.3. Let S be a simplicial set, and let p : X → Y be a morphism in (Set+
following are equivalent:

Proof. Since Map♯

S(X, Z ♮)K

identiﬁcation

Map♭

S(M, Z(K)♮) ≃ Map♭

S(M, Z(K)♮).

The largest Kan complex contained in the right hand side is Map♯
natural map

S(M, Z(K)♮). On the other hand, the

Map♯

S(Y, Z(K)♮) → Map♯

S(X, Z(K)♮)

is homotopy equivalence by assumption (2).

We will say that a map X → Y in (Set+

∆)/S is a Cartesian equivalence if it satisﬁes the equivalent

conditions of Proposition 3.1.3.3.

133

Remark 3.1.3.4. Let f : X → Y be a morphism in (Set+
∆)/S which is marked anodyne when regarded
as a map of marked simplicial sets. Since the smash product of f with any inclusion A♭ ⊆ B♭ is also
marked-anodyne, we deduce that the map

φ : Map♭

S(Y, Z ♮) → Map♭

S(X, Z ♮)

is a trivial ﬁbration for every Cartesian ﬁbration Z → S. Consequently, f is a Cartesian equivalence.

Let S be a simplicial set and let X, Y ∈ (Set+

∆)/S. We will say a pair of morphisms f, g : X → Y are
strongly homotopic if there exists a contractible Kan complex K and a map K → Map♭
S(X, Y ), whose image
contains both of the vertices f and g. If Y = Z ♮, where Z → S is a Cartesian ﬁbration, then this simply
means that f and g are equivalent when viewed as objects of the ∞-category Map♭

S(X, Y ).

Proposition 3.1.3.5. Let X

(1) The map p induces a Cartesian equivalence X ♮ → Y ♮ in (Set+

∆)/S.

(2) There exists a map r : Y → X which is a strong homotopy inverse to p, in the sense that p ◦ r and

r ◦ p are both strongly homotopic to the identity.

(3) The map p induces a categorical equivalence Xs → Ys, for each vertex s of S.

Proof. The equivalence between (1) and (2) is easy, as is the assertion that (2) implies (3). It therefore
suﬃces to show that (3) implies (2). We will construct r and a homotopy from r ◦ p to the identity. It then
follows that the map r satisﬁes (3), so the same argument will show that r has a right homotopy inverse; by
general nonsense this right homotopy inverse is automatically homotopic to p and the proof will be complete.
β<α S(β)
by adjoining a single nondegenerate simplex (if such a simplex exists). We construct rα : Y ×S S(α) → X
and an equivalence hα : (X ×S S(α)) × ∆1 → X ×S S(α) from rα ◦ p to the identity, by induction on α. By
this device we may reduce to the case where S = ∆n, and the maps

in such a way that ψ carries {x} × ∆1 to an equivalence in X, for every object x of X. We note that this
last condition is vacuous for n > 0.

If n = 0, the problem amounts to constructing a map Y → X which is homotopy inverse to p: this is
possible in view of the assumption that p is a categorical equivalence. For n > 0, we note that any map
φ : Z → X extending φ0 is automatically compatible with the projection to S (since S is a simplex and

Z ′ contains all vertices of Z). Since the inclusion Z ′ ⊆ Z is a coﬁbration between coﬁbrant objects in the
model category Set∆ (with the Joyal model structure), and X is a ∞-category (since q is an inner ﬁbration
and ∆n is a ∞-category), Proposition A.2.3.1 asserts that it is suﬃcient to show that the extension φ exists
up to homotopy. Since Corollary 2.4.4.4 implies that p is an equivalence, we are free to replace the inclusion
Z ′ ⊆ Z with the weakly equivalent inclusion

(X ×∆n ∂ ∆n × {1}) ⊆ X × ∆1.

Since φ0 carries {x} × ∆1 to a (q ◦ p)-Cartesian edge of X, for every vertex x of X, the existence of φ follows
from Proposition 3.1.1.5.

property with respect to p. Equivalently, we must show that Z ♮ → S has the right lifting property with
respect to the inclusion

(B♯ × X)

(A♯ × Y ) ⊆ B♯ × Y.

aA♯×X

This follows from Proposition 3.1.2.3, since the inclusion A♯ ⊆ B♯ is marked anodyne.

Proposition 3.1.3.7. Let S be a simplicial set. There exists a left proper, combinatorial model structure
on (Set+

∆)/S, which may be described as follows:

(C) The coﬁbrations in (Set+

∆)/S are those morphisms p : X → Y in (Set+

∆)/S which are coﬁbrations when

regarded as morphisms of simplicial sets.

(W ) The weak equivalences in (Set+

∆)/S are the Cartesian equivalences.

(F ) The ﬁbrations in (Set+

∆)/S are those maps which have the right lifting property with respect to every

map which is simultaneously a coﬁbration and a Cartesian equivalence.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that the hypotheses of Proposition A.2.6.13 are satisﬁed by the class (C) of
coﬁbrations and the class (W ).

(1) The class (W ) of Cartesian equivalences is perfect, in the sense of Deﬁnition A.2.6.10. To prove this,
we ﬁrst observe that the class of marked anodyne maps is generated by the classes (1), (2), (3) of
Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1 and (4′) of Corollary 3.1.1.8. By Proposition A.1.2.5, there exists a functor T from
(Set+

∆)/S to itself and a (functorial) factorization

X

iX→ T (X)

jX→ S♯

where iX is marked anodyne (and therefore a Cartesian equivalence) and jX has the right lifting
property with respect to all marked anodyne maps, and therefore corresponds to a Cartesian ﬁbration
over S. Moreover, the functor T commutes with ﬁltered colimits. According to Proposition 3.1.3.5, a
map X → Y in (Set+
∆)/S is a Cartesian equivalence if and only if, for each vertex s ∈ S, the induced
map T (X)s → T (Y )s is a categorical equivalence. It follows from Corollary A.2.6.12 that (W ) is a
perfect class of morphisms.

Since p is a Cartesian equivalence, the bottom horizontal arrow is a homotopy equivalence. According
to Lemma 3.1.3.6, the right vertical arrow is a Kan ﬁbration; it follows that the diagram is homotopy
Cartesian and so the top horizontal arrow is an equivalence as well.

(3) A map p : X → Y in (Set+

∆)/S which has the right lifting property with respect to every map in (C)
belongs to (W ). Unwinding the deﬁnition, we see that p is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and
that an edge e of X is marked if and only if p(e) is a marked edge of Y . It follows that p has a section
s, with s ◦ p ﬁberwise homotopic to idX . From this, we deduce easily that p is a Cartesian equivalence.

Warning 3.1.3.8. Let S be a simplicial set. We must be careful to distinguish between Cartesian ﬁbrations
of simplicial sets (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.4.2.1) and ﬁbrations with respect to the Cartesian model
structure on (Set+
∆)/S (in the sense of Proposition 3.1.3.7). Though distinct, these notions are closely related:
for example, the ﬁbrant objects of (Set+
∆)/S are precisely those objects of the form X ♮, where X → S is a
Cartesian ﬁbration (Proposition 3.1.4.1).

Remark 3.1.3.9. The deﬁnition of the Cartesian model structure on (Set+
quently, we can deﬁne another model structure on (Set+

∆)/S as follows:

∆)/S is not self-opposite. Conse-

(C) The coﬁbrations in (Set+

∆)/S are precisely the monomorphisms.

(W ) The weak equivalences in (Set+

∆)/S are precisely the coCartesian equivalences: that is, those morphisms

op

is a Cartesian equivalence in (Set+

∆)/Sop.

(F ) The ﬁbrations in (Set+

∆)/S are those morphisms which have the right lifting property with respect to

every morphism satisfying both (C) and (W ).

We will refer to this model structure on (Set+

∆)/S as the coCartesian model structure.

3.1.4 Properties of the Cartesian Model Structure

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that X is ﬁbrant. The small object argument implies that there exists a marked
anodyne map j : X → Z ♮ for some Cartesian ﬁbration Z → S. Since j is marked anodyne, it is a Cartesian
equivalence. Since X is ﬁbrant, it has the extension property with respect to the trivial coﬁbration j; thus
X is a retract of Z ♮. It follows that X is isomorphic to Y ♮, where Y is a retract of Z.

Now suppose that Y → S is a Cartesian ﬁbration; we claim that Y ♮ has the right lifting property
∆)/S. Since j is a Cartesian equivalence, the
S(A, Y ♮) is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes. Hence, for any map
S(A, Z ♮). Let
A×{1}♯(B × {1}♯) ⊆ B × (∆1)♯. We observe that e and g together determine a map

with respect to any trivial coﬁbration j : A → B in (Set+

f : A → Z ♮, there is a map g : B → Z ♮ such that g|A and f are joined by an edge e of Map♯

The left vertical arrow is marked anodyne, by Proposition 3.1.2.3. Consequently, there exists a dotted arrow
F as indicated. We note that F |B × {0} is an extension of f to B, as desired.

We now study the behavior of the Cartesian model structures with respect to products.

Proposition 3.1.4.2. Let S and T simplicial sets, and let Z be an object of (Set+

∆)/T . Then the functor

(Set+

∆)/S → (Set+

∆)/S×T

preserves Cartesian equivalences.

X 7→ X × Z

Proof. Let f : X → Y be a Cartesian equivalence in (Set+
∆)/S. We wish to show that f × idZ is a Cartesian
∆)/S×T . Let X → X ′ be a marked anodyne map where X ′ ∈ (Set+
equivalence in (Set+
∆)/S is ﬁbrant. Now
X Y → Y ′, where Y ′ ∈ (Set+
choose a marked-anodyne map X ′
∆)/S is ﬁbrant. Since the product maps
X × Z → X ′ × Z and Y × Z → Y ′ × Z are also marked anodyne (by Proposition 3.1.2.3), it suﬃces to show
that X ′ × Z → Y ′ × Z is a Cartesian equivalence. In other words, we may reduce to the situation where X
and Y are ﬁbrant. By Proposition 3.1.3.5, f has a homotopy inverse g; then g × idY is a homotopy inverse
to f × idY .

in (Set+
∆)/S is trivial if either i is a Cartesian equivalence of j is a weak homotopy equivalence. If i is trivial,
this follows immediately from Corollary 3.1.4.3. If j is trivial, the same argument applies, provided that we

for every ∞-category Z, the restriction map

θ : Map♯(Y ′♯, Z ♮) → Map♯(Y ♯, Z ♮)

can be identiﬁed with the restriction map

Since j is a weak homotopy equivalence, this map is a trivial ﬁbration.

Remark 3.1.4.5. There is a second simplicial structure on (Set+
are given by Map♭
for ﬁxed X ∈ (Set+

∆)/S, where the simplicial mapping spaces
S(X, Y ). This simplicial structure is not compatible with the Cartesian model structure:
∆)/S, the functor

A 7→ A♭ × X

does not carry weak homotopy equivalences (in the A-variable) to Cartesian equivalences. It does, however,
carry categorical equivalences (in A) to Cartesian equivalences, and consequently (Set+
∆)/S is endowed with
the structure of a Set∆-enriched model category, where we regard Set∆ as equipped with the Joyal model
structure. This second simplicial structure reﬂects the fact that (Set+
∆)/S is really a model for an ∞-
bicategory.

Remark 3.1.4.6. Suppose S is a Kan complex. A map p : X → S is a Cartesian ﬁbration if and only if it is
a coCartesian ﬁbration (this follows in general from Proposition 3.3.1.8; if S = ∆0, the main case of interest
for us, it is obvious). Moreover, the class p-coCartesian edges of X coincides with the class of p-Cartesian
edges of X: both may be described as the class of equivalences in X. Consequently, if A ∈ (Set+

∆)/S, then

Map♭

S(A, X ♮) ≃ Map♭

Sop(Aop, (X op)♮)op,

where Aop is regarded as a marked simplicial set in the obvious way. It follows that a map A → B is a
Cartesian equivalence in (Set+
∆)/Sop . In
other words, the Cartesian model structure on (Set+
∆)/S is self-dual when S is a Kan complex. In particular,
if S = ∆0, we deduce that the functor

∆)/S if and only if Aop → Bop is a Cartesian equivalence in (Set+

A 7→ Aop
determines an autoequivalence of the model category Set+

∆ ≃ (Set+

∆)/∆0 .

3.1.5 Comparison of Model Categories

Let S be a simplicial set. We now have a plethora of model structures on categories of simplicial sets over S:

(0) Let C0 denote the category (Set∆)/S of simplicial sets over S endowed with the Joyal model structure
deﬁned in §2.2.5: the coﬁbrations are monomorphisms of simplicial sets, and the weak equivalences are
categorical equivalences.

(1) Let C1 denote the category (Set+

∆)/S of marked simplicial sets over S, endowed with the marked
model structure of Proposition 3.1.3.7: the coﬁbrations are maps (X, EX ) → (Y, EY ) which induce
monomorphisms X → Y , and the weak equivalences are the Cartesian equivalences.

(2) Let C2 denote the category (Set+

∆)/S of marked simplicial sets over S, endowed with the following
localization of the Cartesian model structure: a map f : (X, EX ) → (Y, EY ) is a coﬁbration if the
underlying map X → Y is a monomorphism, and a weak equivalence if f : X ♯ → Y ♯ is a marked
equivalence in (Set+

∆)/S.

138

(3) Let C3 denote the category (Set∆)/S of simplicial sets over S, which is endowed with the contravariant
model structure described in §2.1.4: the coﬁbrations are the monomorphisms, and the weak equivalences
are the contravariant equivalences.

(4) Let C4 denote the category (Set∆)/S of simplicial sets over S, endowed with the usual homotopy-
theoretic model structure: the coﬁbrations are the monomorphisms of simplicial sets, and the weak
equivalences are the weak homotopy equivalences of simplicial sets.

The goal of this section is to study the relationship between these ﬁve model categories. We may

summarize the situation as follows:

Theorem 3.1.5.1. There exists a sequence of Quillen adjunctions

C0

F0→ C1

F1→ C2

F2→ C3

F3→ C4

C0

G0← C1

G1← C2

G2← C3

G3← C4

which may be described as follows:

(A0) The functor G0 is the forgetful functor from (Set+

∆)/S to (Set∆)/S, which ignores the collection of
marked edges. The functor F0 is the left adjoint to G0, which is given by X 7→ X ♭. The Quillen
adjunction (F0, G0) is a Quillen equivalence if S is a Kan complex.

(A1) The functors F1 and G1 are the identity functors on (Set+

∆)/S.

(A2) The functor F2 is the forgetful functor from (Set+

∆)/S to (Set∆)/S, which ignores the collection of
marked edges. The functor G2 is the right adjoint to F2, which is given by X 7→ X ♯. The Quillen
adjunction (F2, G2) is a Quillen equivalence for every simplicial set S.

(A3) The functors F3 and G3 are the identity functors on (Set+

∆)/S. The Quillen adjunction (F3, G3) is a

Quillen equivalence whenever S is a Kan complex.

The rest of this section is devoted to giving a proof of Theorem 3.1.5.1. We will organize our eﬀorts as
follows. First, we verify that the model category C2 is well-deﬁned (the analogous results for the other model
structures have already been established). We then consider each of the adjunctions (Fi, Gi) in turn, and
show that it has the desired properties.

Proposition 3.1.5.2. Let S be a simplicial set. There exists a left proper, combinatorial model structure
on the category (Set+

∆)/S which may be described as follows:

(C) A map f : (X, EX ) → (Y, EY ) is a coﬁbration if and only if the underlying map X → Y is a monomor-

phism of simplicial sets.

(W ) A map f : (X, EX ) → (Y, EY ) is a weak equivalence if and only if the induced map X ♯ → Y ♯ is a

Cartesian equivalence in (Set+

∆)/S.

(F ) A map f : (X, EX ) → (Y, EY ) is a ﬁbration if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect

to all trivial coﬁbrations.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that the conditions of Proposition A.2.6.13 are satisﬁed. We check them in turn:

(1) The class (W ) of Cartesian equivalences is perfect, in the sense of Deﬁnition A.2.6.10. This follows from
Corollary A.2.6.12, since the class of Cartesian equivalences is perfect, and the functor (X, EX ) → X ♯
commutes with ﬁltered colimits.

(2) The class of weak equivalences is stable under pushouts by coﬁbrations. This follows from the analogous
property of the Cartesian model structure, since the functor (X, EX ) 7→ X ♯ preserves pushouts.

139

(3) A map p : (X, EX ) → (Y, EY ) which has the right lifting property with respect to every coﬁbration
is a weak equivalence. In this case, the underlying map of simplicial sets is a trivial ﬁbration, so the
induced map X ♯ → Y ♯ has the right lifting property with respect to all trivial coﬁbrations, and is a
Cartesian equivalence as observed in the proof of Proposition 3.1.3.7.

Proposition 3.1.5.3. Let S be simplicial set. Consider the adjoint functors

described by the formulas

(Set∆)/S

F0

G0

/(Set+

∆)/S

F0(X) = X ♭
G0(X, E) = X.

The adjoint functors (F0, G0) determine a Quillen adjunction between (Set∆)/S (with the Joyal model struc-
ture) and (Set+
∆)/S (with the Cartesian model structure). If S is a Kan complex, then (F0, G0) is a Quillen
equivalence.

Proof. To prove that (F0, G0) is a Quillen adjunction, it will suﬃce to show that F1 preserves coﬁbrations
and trivial coﬁbrations. The ﬁrst claim is obvious. For the second, we must show that if X ⊆ Y is a
categorical equivalence of simplicial sets over S, then the induced map X ♭ → Y ♭ is a Cartesian equivalence
in (Set+

∆)/S. For this, it suﬃces to show that for any Cartesian ﬁbration p : Z → S, the restriction map

Map♭

S(Y ♭, Z ♮) → Map♭

S(X ♭, Z ♮)

is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. In other words, we must show that for every inclusion A ⊆ B of
simplicial sets, it is possible to solve any lifting problem of the form

may rephrase the lifting problem as the problem of constructing the dotted arrow indicated in the following
diagram:

By Proposition 3.3.1.7, p is a categorical ﬁbration, and the lifting problem has a solution in virtue of the
assumption that X ⊆ Y is a categorical equivalence.

Now suppose that S is a Kan complex. We want to prove that (F0, G0) is a Quillen equivalence. In
other words, we must show that for any ﬁbrant object of (Set+
∆)/S corresponding to a Cartesian ﬁbration
Z → S, a map X → Z in (Set∆)/S is a categorical equivalence if and only if the associated map X ♭ → Z ♮ is
a Cartesian equivalence.

Suppose ﬁrst that X → Z is a categorical equivalence. Then the induced map X ♭ → Z ♭ is a Cartesian
It therefore suﬃces to show that Z ♭ → Z ♮ is a Cartesian

equivalence, by the argument given above.

in Z. The marked edges of Z ♮ are precisely the edges which belong to K, so we have a pushout diagram

K ♭

K ♯

Z ♭

/ Z ♮.

It follows that Z ♭ → Z ♮ is marked anodyne, and therefore a Cartesian equivalence.
Now suppose that X ♭ → Z ♮ is a Cartesian equivalence. Choose a factorization X

g
→ Z, where f is a
categorical equivalence and g is a categorical ﬁbration. We wish to show that g is a categorical equivalence.
Proposition 3.3.1.8 implies that Z → S is a categorical ﬁbration, so that X ′ → S is a categorical ﬁbration.
Applying Proposition 3.3.1.8 again, we deduce that Y → S is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Thus we have a
factorization

f
→ Y

X ♭ → Y ♭ → Y ♮ → Z ♮

where the ﬁrst two maps are Cartesian equivalences by the arguments given above, and the composite map is
a Cartesian equivalence. Thus Y ♮ → Z ♮ is an equivalence between ﬁbrant objects of (Set+
∆)/S, and therefore
admits a homotopy inverse. The existence of this homotopy inverse proves that g is a categorical equivalence,
as desired.

Proposition 3.1.5.4. Let S be a simplicial set, and let F1 and G1 denote the identity functor from (Set+
to itself. Then (F1, G1) determines a Quillen adjunction between C1 and C2.

∆)/S

Proof. We must show that F1 preserves coﬁbrations and trivial coﬁbrations. The ﬁrst claim is obvious. For
the second, let B : (Set+

∆)/S be the functor deﬁned by

∆)/S → (Set+

B(M, EM ) = M ♯.

We wish to show that if X → Y is a Cartesian equivalence in (Set+
equivalence.

∆)/S, then B(X) → B(Y ) is a Cartesian

We ﬁrst observe that if X → Y is marked anodyne, then the induced map B(X) → B(Y ) is also marked
anodyne: by general nonsense, it suﬃces to check this for the generators described in Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1, for
which it is obvious. Now return to the case of a general Cartesian equivalence p : X → Y , and choose a
diagram

X

q

$IIIIIIIIII

j

X Y

/ Y ′

in which X ′ and Y ′ are (marked) ﬁbrant and i and j are marked anodyne. It follows that B(i) and B(j) are
`
marked anodyne, and therefore Cartesian equivalences. Thus, to prove that B(p) is a Cartesian equivalence,
it suﬃces to show that B(q) is a Cartesian equivalence. But q is a Cartesian equivalence between ﬁbrant
objects of (Set+
∆)/S, and therefore has a homotopy inverse. It follows that B(q) also has a homotopy inverse,
and is therefore a Cartesian equivalence as desired.

Remark 3.1.5.5. In the language of model categories, we may summarize Proposition 3.1.5.4 by saying
that the model structure of Proposition 3.1.5.2 is a localization of the Cartesian model structure on (Set+
∆)/S.

F2(X, E) = X
G2(X) = X ♯.

The adjoint functors (F2, G2) determines a Quillen equivalence between C2 and C3.

Proof. We ﬁrst claim that F2 is conservative: that is, a map f : (X, EX ) → (Y, EY ) is a weak equivalence in
C2 if and only if the induced map X → Y is a weak equivalence in C3. Unwinding the deﬁnition, f is a weak
equivalence if and only if X ♯ → Y ♯ is a Cartesian equivalence. This holds if and only if, for every Cartesian
ﬁbration Z → S, the induced map

φ : Map♯

S(Y ♯, Z ♮) → Map♯

S(X ♯, Z ♮)

is a homotopy equivalence. Let Z 0 → S be the right ﬁbration associated to Z → S (see Corollary 2.4.2.5).
S(Y ♯, Z ♮) ≃ MapS(Y, Z 0), Map♯
There are natural identiﬁcations Map♯
S(X ♯, Z ♮) ≃ MapS(X, Z 0). Conse-
quently, f is a weak equivalence if and only if, for every right ﬁbration Z 0 → S, the associated map

MapS(Y, Z 0) → MapS(X, Z 0)

is a homotopy equivalence. Since C3 is a simplicial model category for which the ﬁbrant objects are precisely
the right ﬁbrations Z 0 → S (Corollary 2.2.3.12), this is equivalent to the assertion that X → Y is a weak
equivalence in C3.

To prove that (F2, G2) is a Quillen adjunction, it suﬃces to show that F2 preserves coﬁbrations and trivial
coﬁbrations. The ﬁrst claim is obvious, and the second follows because F2 preserves all weak equivalences,
by the above argument.

To show that (F2, G2) is a Quillen equivalence, we must show that the unit and counit

LF2 ◦ RG2 → id

id → RG2 ◦ LF2

are weak equivalences.
In view of the fact that F2 = LF2 is conservative, the second assertion follows
from the ﬁrst. As to the ﬁrst, it suﬃces to show that if X is a ﬁbrant object of C3, then the counit map
(F2 ◦ G2)(X) → X is a weak equivalence. But this map is an isomorphism.

Proposition 3.1.5.7. Let S be a simplicial set, and let F3 and G3 denote the identity functor from (Set∆)/S
to itself. Then (F3, G3) gives a Quillen adjunction between C3 and C4. If S is a Kan complex, then (F3, G3)
is a Quillen equivalence (in other words, the model structures on C3 and C4 coincide).

Proof. To prove that (F3, G3) is a Quillen adjunction, it suﬃces to prove that F3 preserves coﬁbrations and
weak equivalences. The ﬁrst claim is obvious (the coﬁbrations in C3 and C4 are the same). For the second, we
note that both C3 and C4 are simplicial model categories in which every object is coﬁbrant. Consequently,
a map f : X → Y is a weak equivalence if and only if, for every ﬁbrant object Z, the associated map
Map(Y, Z) → Map(X, Z) is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes. Thus, to show that F3 preserves
weak equivalences, it suﬃces to show that G3 preserves ﬁbrant objects. A map p : Z → S is ﬁbrant as an
object of C4 if and only if p is a Kan ﬁbration, and ﬁbrant as an object of C3 if and only if p is a right
ﬁbration (Corollary 2.2.3.12). Since every Kan ﬁbration is a right ﬁbration, it follows that F3 preserves
weak equivalences. If S is a Kan complex, then the converse holds: according to Lemma 2.1.3.4, every right
ﬁbration p : Z → S is a Kan ﬁbration. It follows that G3 preserves weak equivalences as well, so that the
two model structures under consideration coincide.

3.2 Straightening and Unstraightening

Let C be a category, and let χ : Cop → Cat be a functor from C to the category Cat of small categories. To
this data, we can associate (by means of the Grothendieck construction discussed in §2.1.1) a new category
C which may be described as follows:

• The objects of

C are pairs (C, η) where C ∈ C and η ∈ χ(C).

e

• Given a pair of objects (C, η), (C′, η′) ∈

C is a pair (f, α),
where f : C → C′ is a morphism in the category C and α : η → χ(f )(η′) is a morphism in the category
χ(C).

C), a morphism from (C, η) to (C′, η′) in

e

e

e

• Composition is deﬁned in the obvious way.

This construction establishes an equivalence between Cat-valued functors on Cop and categories which are
ﬁbered over C. (To formulate the equivalence precisely, it is best to view Cat as a bicategory, but we will not
dwell on this technical point here.)

The goal of this section is to establish an ∞-categorical version of the equivalence described above. We
will replace the category C by a simplicial set S, the category Cat by the ∞-category Cat∞, and the notion
of “ﬁbered category” with the notion of “Cartesian ﬁbration”. In this setting, we will obtain an equivalence
of ∞-categories, which arises from a Quillen equivalence of simplicial model categories. On one side, we have
the category (Set+
∆)/S, equipped with the Cartesian model structure (a simplicial model category whose
ﬁbrant objects are precisely the Cartesian ﬁbrations X → S; see §3.1.4). On the other, we have the category
of simplicial functors

C[S]op → Set+
∆,

equipped with the projective model structure (see §A.3.3), whose underlying ∞-category is equivalent to
Fun(Sop, Cat∞) (Proposition 4.2.4.4). The situation may be summarized as follows:

Theorem 3.2.0.1. Let S be a simplicial set, C a simplicial category, and φ : C[S] → Cop a functor between
simplicial categories. Then there exists a pair of adjoint functors

structure) and (Set+

(2) If φ is an equivalence of simplicial categories, then (St+

φ ) is a Quillen equivalence.

φ and U n+

We will refer to St+

φ as the straightening and unstraightening functors, respectively. We will
give a construct these functors in §3.2.1, and establish part (1) of Theorem 3.2.0.1. Part (2) is more diﬃcult
and requires some preliminary work; we will begin in §3.2.2 by analyzing the structure of Cartesian ﬁbrations
X → ∆n. We will apply these analyses in §3.2.3 to complete the proof of Theorem 3.2.0.1 in the case where
S is a simplex. In §3.2.4, we will deduce the general result, using formal arguments to reduce to the special
case of a simplex.

In the case where C is an ordinary category, the straightening and unstraightening procedures of §3.2.1
can be substantially simpliﬁed. We will discuss the situation in §3.2.5, where we provide an analogue of
Theorem 3.2.0.1 (see Propositions 3.2.5.18 and 3.2.5.21).

3.2.1 The Straightening Functor
Let S be a simplicial set, and let φ : C[S] → Cop be a functor between simplicial categories, which we regard as
∆)C
ﬁxed throughout this section. Our objective is to deﬁne the straightening functor St+
and its right adjoint U n+
∆)/S associates ∞-categories to vertices of
S in a homotopy coherent fashion, and the functor St+
φ “straightens” this diagram to obtain an ∞-category
valued functor on C. The right adjoint U n+
φ should be viewed as a forgetful functor, which takes a strictly
commutative diagram and retains the underlying homotopy coherent diagram.

∆)/S → (Set+

φ : (Set+

The functors St+

φ are more elaborate versions of the straightening and unstraightening functors
introduced in §2.2.1. We begin by recalling the unmarked version of the construction. For each object
X ∈ (Set∆)/S, form a pushout diagram of simplicial categories

(C, ∗)

where ∗ denotes the cone point of X ⊲.

We will deﬁne St+

φ by designating certain marked edges on the simplicial sets (StφX)(C), which depend
in a natural way on the marked edges of X. In order to describe this dependence, we need to introduce a
bit of notation.

Notation 3.2.1.1. Let X be an object of (Set∆)/S. Given an n-simplex σ of the simplicial set MapCop(C, D),
we let σ∗ : (StφX)(D)n → (StφX)(C)n denote the associated map on n-simplices.

Let c be a vertex of X, and C = φ(c) ∈ C. We may identify c with a map c : ∆0 → X. Then
X , which we may identify

c ⋆ id∆0 : ∆1 → X ⊲ is an edge of X ⊲, which determines a morphism C → ∗ in Cop
with a vertex

c ∈ (StφX)(C).

Similarly, suppose that f : c → d is an edge of X, corresponding to a morphism

e

C F→ D

in the simplicial category Cop. We may identify f with a map f : ∆1 → X. Then f ⋆ id∆1 : ∆2 → X ⊲
determines a map C[∆2] → CX , which we may identify with a diagram (not strictly commutative)

Proof. We must show that i has the left lifting property with respect to every map p : X → S satisfying the
hypotheses of Proposition 3.1.1.6. This is simply a reformulation of Proposition 2.4.1.8.

Lemma 3.2.1.9. Let K be a simplicial set, K ′ ⊆ K a simplicial subset, and A a set of vertices of K. Let
E denote the set of all degenerate edges of K × ∆1, together with the edges {a} × ∆1 where a ∈ A. Let
K ′×{1}(K × {1}) ⊆ K × ∆1. Suppose that, for every nondegenerate simplex σ of K, either
B = (K ′ × ∆1)
σ belongs to K ′, or the ﬁnal vertex of σ belongs to A. Then the inclusion

`

(B, E ∩B1) ⊆ (K × ∆1, E)

is marked anodyne.

Proof. Working cell-by-cell, we reduce to Lemma 3.2.1.8.

Lemma 3.2.1.10. Let X be a simplicial set, and let E ⊆ E′ be sets of edges of X containing all degenerate
edges. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The inclusion (X, E) → (X, E′) is trivial coﬁbration in Set+

∆ (with respect to the Cartesian model

structure).

(2) For every ∞-category C and every map f : X → C which carries each edge of E to an equivalence in

C, f also carries each edge of E′ to an equivalence in C.

Proof. By deﬁnition, (1) holds if and only if for every ∞-category C, the inclusion

j : Map♭((X, E′), C♮) → Map♭((X, E), C♮)

is a categorical equivalence. Condition (2) is the assertion that j is an isomorphism. Thus (2) implies (1).
Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed, and let f : X → C be a vertex of Map♭((X, E), C♮). By hypothesis, there exists
an equivalence f ≃ f ′, where f ′ belongs to the image of j. Let e ∈ E′; then f ′(e) is an equivalence in C.
Since f and f ′ are equivalent, f (e) is also an equivalence in C. Consequently, f also belongs to the image of
j, and the proof is complete.

coﬁbration. It will suﬃce to prove this under the assumption that f is one of the generators for the class
of marked anodyne maps, as given in Deﬁnition 3.1.1.1. Using Proposition 3.2.1.4, we may reduce to the

φ′ : C[S′] → (C′)op simplicial functors; let φ ⊠ φ′ denote the induced functor C[S × S′] → (C × C′)op. For

φ⊠φ′(M × M ′) → St+

φ (M ) ⊠ St+

φ′(M ′)

is a weak equivalence of functors C × C′ → Set+
∆.

Proof. Since both sides are compatible with the formations of ﬁltered colimits in M , we may suppose that
M has only ﬁnitely many nondegenerate simplices. We work by induction on the dimension n of M and
the number of n-dimensional simplices of M . If M = ∅ there is nothing to prove. If n 6= 1, we may choose
(∂ ∆n)♭(∆n)♭. By
a nondegenerate simplex of M having maximal dimension and thereby write M = N
the inductive hypothesis we may suppose that the result is known for N and (∂ ∆n)♭. The map sM,M ′ is
`
a pushout of the maps sN,M ′ and s(∆n)♭,M ′ over s(∂ ∆n)♭,M ′ . Since Set+
∆ is left-proper, this pushout is a
homotopy pushout; it therefore suﬃces to prove the result after replacing M by N , (∂ ∆n)♭, or (∆n)♭. In
the ﬁrst two cases, the inductive hypothesis implies that sM,M ′ is an equivalence; we are therefore reduced
to the case M = (∆n)♭. If n = 0, the result is obvious. If n > 2, we set

K = ∆{0,1}

The inclusion K ⊆ ∆n is inner anodyne, so that K ♭ ⊆ M is marked-anodyne. By Proposition 3.2.1.11, we
deduce that sM,M ′ is an equivalence if and only if sK ♭,M ′ is an equivalence, which follows from the inductive
hypothesis since K is 1-dimensional.

We may therefore suppose that n = 1. Using the above argument, we may reduce to the case where M
consists of a single edge, either marked or unmarked. Repeating the above argument with the roles of M
and M ′ interchanged, we may suppose that M ′ also consists of a single edge. Applying Proposition 3.2.1.4,
we may reduce to the case where S = M , S′ = M ′, C = C[S]op, and C′ = C[S′]op.

Let us denote the vertices of M by x and y, and the unique edge joining them by e : x → y. Similarly, we
let x′ and y′ denote the vertices of M ′, and e′ : x′ → y′ the edge which joins them. We note that the map
sM,M ′ induces an isomorphism when evaluated on any object of C × C′ except (x, x′). Moreover, the map

sM,M ′ (x, x′) : St+

∆
is left proper, we may reduce to the case where M = M ′ = (∆1)♭. The result now follows from a simple
explicit computation.

We now study the situation in which S = ∆0, C = C[S], and φ is the identity map. In this case, St+

φ may

be regarded as a functor T : Set+

∆ → Set+

∆. The underlying functor of simplicial sets is familiar: we have

T (X, E) = (|X|Q• , E′),

where Q denotes the cosimplicial object of Set∆ considered in §2.2.2. In that section, we exhibited a natural
map |X|Q• → X which we proved to be a weak homotopy equivalence. We now prove a stronger version of
that result:

Proposition 3.2.1.14. For any marked simplicial set M = (X, E), the natural map |X|Q• → X induces a
Cartesian equivalence

T (M ) → M.

Proof. As in the proof of Proposition 3.2.1.13, we may reduce to the case where M consists of a simplex
of dimension ≤ 1 (either marked or unmarked). In these cases, the map T (M ) → M is an isomorphism in
Set+
∆.

Corollary 3.2.1.15. Let S be a simplicial set, C a simplicial category, φ : C[S] → Cop a simplicial functor,
and X ∈ (Set+

∆)/S an object. For every K ∈ Set+

∆, there is a natural equivalence

St+

φ (M × K) → St+

φ (M ) ⊠ K

of functors from C to Set+
∆.

Proof. Combine the equivalences of Proposition 3.2.1.14 (in the case where S′ = ∆0, C′ = C[S′]op, and φ′ is
the identity ) and Proposition 3.2.1.15.

We can now complete the proof that (St+

φ , U n+

φ ) is a Quillen adjunction:

Corollary 3.2.1.16. Let S be a simplicial set, C a simplicial category, and φ : C[S]op → C a simplicial
functor. The straightening functor St+

equivalences in (Set+

φ carries Cartesian equivalences in (Set+

Proof. Let f : M → N be a Cartesian equivalence in (Set+

M N → N ′, with N ′ ﬁbrant. Since St+

φ (N ′) is an equivalence. In other words, we may replace M by M ′ and N by N ′, thereby
reducing to the case where M and N are ﬁbrant.

φ (M ′) → St+

Since f is an Cartesian equivalence of ﬁbrant objects, it has a homotopy inverse g. We claim that St+

φ (g)

φ (g) is homotopic
to the identity; applying the same argument with the roles of f and g reversed will then establish the desired
result.

3.2.2 Cartesian Fibrations over a Simplex

A map of simplicial sets p : X → S is a Cartesian ﬁbration if and only if the pullback map X ×S ∆n → ∆n
is a Cartesian ﬁbration, for each simplex of S. Consequently, we might imagine that Cartesian ﬁbrations
X → ∆n are the “primitive building blocks” out of which other Cartesian ﬁbrations are built. The goal of this
section is to prove a structure theorem for these building blocks. This result has a number of consequences,
and will play a vital role in the proof of Theorem 3.2.0.1.

Note that ∆n is the nerve of the category associated to the linearly ordered set

[n] = {0 < 1 < . . . < n}.

Since a Cartesian ﬁbration p : X → S can be thought of as giving a (contravariant) functor from S to ∞-
categories, it is natural to expect a close relationship between Cartesian ﬁbrations X → ∆n and composable
sequences of maps between ∞-categories

In order to establish this relationship, we need to introduce a few deﬁnitions.

Suppose given a composable sequence of maps

A0 ← A1 ← . . . ← An.

φ : A0 ← A1 ← . . . ← An

150

of simplicial sets. The mapping simplex M (φ) of φ is deﬁned as follows. If J is a nonempty ﬁnite linearly
ordered set with greatest element j, then to specify a map ∆J → M (φ) one must specify an order-preserving
map f : J → [n] together with a map σ : ∆J → Af (j). Given an order-preserving map p : J → J ′ of
partially ordered sets containing largest elements j and j′, there is natural map M (φ)(∆J ′
) → M (φ)(∆J )
which carries (f, σ) to (f ◦ p, e ◦ σ), where e : Af (j′) → Af (p(j)) is obtained from φ in the obvious way.

Remark 3.2.2.1. The mapping simplex M (φ) is equipped with a natural map p : M (φ) → ∆n; the ﬁber of
p over the vertex j is isomorphic to the simplicial set Aj.

Remark 3.2.2.2. More generally, let f : [m] → [n] be an order-preserving map, inducing a map ∆m → ∆n.
Then M (φ) ×∆n ∆m is naturally isomorphic to M (φ′), where the sequence φ′ is given by

Af (0) ← . . . ← Af (m).

Notation 3.2.2.3. Let φ : A0 ← . . . ← An be a composable sequence of maps of simplicial sets. To give
an edge e of M (φ), one must give a pair of integers 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n and an edge e ∈ Aj . We will say that e
is marked if e is degenerate; let E denote the set of all marked edges of M (φ). Then the pair (M (φ), E) is a
marked simplicial set which we will denote by M ♮(φ).

Remark 3.2.2.4. There is a potential ambiguity between the terminology of Deﬁnition 3.1.1.9 and that of
Notation 3.2.2.3. Suppose that φ : A0 ← . . . ← An is a composable sequence of maps and that p : M (φ) → ∆n
is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Then M (φ)♮ (Deﬁnition 3.1.1.9) and M ♮(φ) (Notation 3.2.2.3) do not generally
coincide as marked simplicial sets. We feel that there is little danger of confusion, since it is very rare that
p is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

Remark 3.2.2.5. The construction of the mapping simplex is functorial, in the sense that a commutative
ladder

φ : A0

f0

ψ : B0

. . .

. . .

fn

Bn

induces a map M (f ) : M (φ) → M (ψ). Moreover, if each fi is a categorical equivalence, then f is a categorical
equivalence (this follows by induction on n, using the fact that the Joyal model structure is left proper).

Deﬁnition 3.2.2.6. Let p : X → ∆n be a Cartesian ﬁbration, and let

φ : A0 ← . . . ← An

be a composable sequence of maps. A map q : M (φ) → X is a quasi-equivalence if it has the following
properties:

(1) The diagram

is commutative.

(2) The map q carries marked edges of M (φ) to p-Cartesian edges of S; in other words, q induces a map

M ♮(φ) → X ♮ of marked simplicial sets.

(3) For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, the induced map Ai → p−1{i} is a categorical equivalence.

The goal of this section is to prove the following:

Proposition 3.2.2.7. Let p : X → ∆n be a Cartesian ﬁbration.

(1) There exists a composable sequence of maps

φ : A0 ← A1 ← . . . ← An

and a quasi-equivalence q : M (φ) → X.

(2) Let

φ : A0 ← A1 ← . . . ← An
be a composable sequence of maps and q : M (φ) → X a quasi-equivalence. For any map T → ∆n, the
induced map

M (φ) ×∆n T → X ×∆n T

is a categorical equivalence.

We ﬁrst show that, to establish (2) of Proposition 3.2.2.7, it suﬃces to consider the case where T is a

simplex:

Proposition 3.2.2.8. Suppose given a diagram

X → Y → Z

of simplicial sets. For any map T → Z, we let XT denote X ×Z T and YT denote Y ×Z T . The following
statements are equivalent:

(1) For any map T → Z, the induced map XT → YT is a categorical equivalence.

(2) For any n ≥ 0 and any map ∆n → Z, the induced map X∆n → Y∆n is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. It is clear that (1) implies (2). Let us prove the converse. Since the class of categorical equivalences
is stable under ﬁltered colimits, it suﬃces to consider the case where T has only ﬁnitely many nondegenerate
simplices. We now work by induction on the dimension of T , and the number of nondegenerate simplices
∂ ∆n ∆n. By the
contained in T . If T is empty, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, we may write T = T ′
inductive hypothesis, the maps

`

XT ′ → YT ′

X∂ ∆n → Y∂ ∆n

are categorical equivalences, and by assumption X∆n → Y∆n is a categorical equivalence as well. We note
that

XT = XT ′

X∆n

aX∂ ∆n

YT = YT ′

Y∆n .

Since the Joyal model structure is left-proper, these pushouts are homotopy pushouts, and therefore cate-
gorically equivalent to one another.

aY∂ ∆n

Suppose p : X → ∆n is a Cartesian ﬁbration, and q : M (φ) → X is a quasi-equivalence. Let f : ∆m → ∆n
be any map. We note (see Remark 3.2.2.5) that M (φ) ×∆n ∆m may be identiﬁed with a mapping simplex
M (φ′), and that the induced map

M (φ′) → X ×∆n ∆m

is again a quasi-equivalence. Consequently, to establish (2) of Proposition 3.2.2.7, it suﬃces to prove that
every quasi-equivalence is a categorical equivalence. First, we need the following lemma.

152

Lemma 3.2.2.9. Let

φ : A0 ← . . . ← An
be a composable sequence of maps between simplicial sets, where n > 0. Let y be a vertex of An, and let the
edge e : y′ → y be the image of ∆{n−1,n} × {y} under the map ∆n × An → M (φ). Let x be any vertex of
M (φ) which does not belong to the ﬁber An. Then composition with e induces a weak homotopy equivalence
of simplicial sets

MapC[M(φ)](x, y′) → MapC[M(φ)](x, y).

Proof. Replacing φ by an equivalent diagram if necessary (using Remark 3.2.2.5), we may suppose that the
map An → An−1 is a coﬁbration. Let φ′ denote the composable subsequence

Let C = C[M (φ)] and let C− = C[M (φ′)] ⊆ C. There is a pushout diagram in Cat∆

A0 ← . . . ← An−1.

C[An × ∆n−1]

C[An × ∆n]

C−

/ C .

This diagram is actually a homotopy pushout, since Cat∆ is a left proper model category and the top
horizontal map is a coﬁbration. Form now the pushout

C[An × ∆n−1]

/ C[An × (∆n−1

{n−1} ∆{n−1,n})]

C−

`

/ C0 .

This diagram is also a homotopy pushout. Since the diagram of simplicial sets

{n − 1}

∆{n−1,n}

∆n−1

/ ∆n

is homotopy coCartesian (with respect to the Joyal model structure), we deduce that the natural map C0 → C
is an equivalence of simplicial categories. It therefore suﬃces to prove that composition with e induces a
weak homotopy equivalence

MapC0 (x, y′) → MapC(x, y).

Form a pushout square

C[An × {n − 1, n}]

C[An] × C[∆{n−1,n}]

C0

F

/ C′ .

The left vertical map is a coﬁbration (since An → An−1 is a coﬁbration of simplicial sets), and the upper
horizontal map is an equivalence of simplicial categories (Corollary 2.2.5.6). Invoking the left-properness of
Cat∆, we conclude that F is an equivalence of simplicial categories. Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove
that MapC′ (F (x), F (y′)) → MapC′ (F (x), F (y)) is a weak homotopy equivalence. We now observe that this
map is an isomorphism of simplicial sets.

Proposition 3.2.2.10. Let p : X → ∆n be a Cartesian ﬁbration, let

φ : A0 ← . . . ← An

be a composable sequence of maps of simplicial sets, and let q : M (φ) → X be a quasi-equivalence. Then q
is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. We proceed by induction on n. The result is obvious if n = 0, so let us assume that n > 0. Let φ′
denote the composable sequence of maps

A0 ← A1 ← . . . ← An−1

which is obtained from φ by omitting An. Let v denote the ﬁnal vertex of ∆n, and let T = ∆{0,...,n−1}
denote the face of ∆n which is opposite v. Let Xv = X ×∆n {v} and XT = X ×∆n T .

We note that M (φ) = M (φ′)

An×T (An × ∆n). We wish to show that the simplicial functor

F : C ≃ C[M (φ)] ≃ C[M (φ′)]

`

C[An × ∆n] → C[X]

C[An×T ]
a

is an equivalence of simplicial categories. We note that C decomposes naturally into full subcategories
C+ = C[An × {v}] and C− = C[M (φ′)], having the property that MapC(X, Y ) = ∅ if x ∈ C+, y ∈ C−.

Similarly, D = C[X] decomposes into full subcategories D+ = C[Xv] and D− = C[XT ], satisfying
MapD(x, y) = ∅ if x ∈ D+ and y ∈ D−. We observe that F restricts to give an equivalence between
C− and D− by assumption, and gives an equivalence between C+ and D+ by the inductive hypothesis. To
complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that if x ∈ C− and y ∈ C+, then F induces a homotopy equivalence

MapC(x, y) → MapD(F (x), F (y)).

We may identify the object y ∈ C+ with a vertex of An. Let e denote the edge of M (φ) which is the
image of {y} × ∆{n−1,n} under the map An × ∆n → M (φ). We let [e] : y′ → y denote the corresponding
morphism in C. We have a commutative diagram

MapC−(x, y′)

MapC(x, y)

MapD−(F (x), F (y′))

/ MapD(F (x), F (y)).

Here the left vertical arrow is a weak homotopy equivalence by the inductive hypothesis, and the bottom
horizontal arrow (which is given by composition with [e]) is a weak homotopy equivalence because q(e) is
p-Cartesian. Consequently, to complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that the top horizontal arrow (given
by composition with e) is a weak homotopy equivalence. This follows immediately from Lemma 3.2.2.9.

To complete the proof of Proposition 3.2.2.7, it now suﬃces to show that for any Cartesian ﬁbration
p : X → ∆n, there exists a quasi-equivalence M (φ) → X. In fact, we will prove something slightly stronger
(in order to make our induction work):

Proposition 3.2.2.11. Let p : X → ∆n be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets and A another simplicial
set. Suppose given a commutative diagram of marked simplicial sets

of the previous diagram, such that f is a quasi-equivalence.

Proof. The proof goes by induction on n. We begin by considering the ﬁber s over the ﬁnal vertex v of ∆n.
The map sv : A → Xv = X ×∆n {v} admits a factorization

A

g

→ An h→ Sv

where g is a coﬁbration and h is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. The smash product inclusion

({v}♯ × (An)♭)

((∆n)♯ × A♭) ⊆ (∆n)♯ × (An)♭

a{v}♯×A♭

is marked anodyne (Proposition 3.1.2.3). Consequently, we deduce the existence of a dotted arrow f0 as
indicated in the diagram

Corollary 3.2.2.12. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and let q : Y → Z be a
coCartesian ﬁbration. Deﬁne new simplicial sets Y ′ and Z ′ equipped with maps Y ′ → S, Z ′ → S via the
formulas

HomS(K, Y ′) ≃ Hom(X ×S K, Y )
HomS(K, Z ′) ≃ Hom(X ×S K, Z).

Then:

(1) Composition with q determines a coCartesian ﬁbration q′ : Y ′ → Z ′.

(2) An edge ∆1 → Y ′ is q′-coCartesian if and only if the induced map ∆1 ×S X → Y carries p-Cartesian

edges to q-coCartesian edges.

Proof. Let us say that an edge of Y ′ is special if it satisﬁes the hypothesis of (2). Our ﬁrst goal is to show
that there is a suﬃcient supply of special edges in Y ′. More precisely, we claim that given any edge e : z → z′
in Z ′ and any vertex

z ∈ Y ′ covering z, there exists a special edge

3.1.2.1).

To complete the proofs of (1) and (2), it will suﬃce to show that q′ is an inner ﬁbration and that every

special edge of Y ′ is q′-coCartesian. For this, we must show that every lifting problem

which admits a solution in virtue of Proposition 3.1.2.1.

Corollary 3.2.2.13. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and let q : Y → S be a
coCartesian ﬁbration. Deﬁne a new simplicial set T equipped with a map T → S by the formula

HomS(K, T ) ≃ HomS(X ×S K, Y ).

Then:

(1) The projection r : T → S is a coCartesian ﬁbration.

(2) An edge ∆1 → Z is r-coCartesian if and only if the induced map ∆1 ×S X → ∆1 ×S Y carries

p-Cartesian edges to q-coCartesian edges.

Proof. Apply Corollary 3.2.2.12 in the case where Z = S.

We conclude by noting the following additional property of quasi-equivalences, using the terminology of

§3.1.3:

Proposition 3.2.2.14. Let S = ∆n, let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration, let

φ : A0 ← . . . ← An

be a composable sequence of maps, and let q : M (φ) → X be a quasi-equivalence. The induced map M ♮(φ) →
X ♮ is a Cartesian equivalence in (Set+

∆)/S.

Proof. We must show that for any Cartesian ﬁbration Y → S, the induced map of ∞-categories

Map♭

S(X ♮, Y ♮) → Map♭

S(M ♮(φ), Y ♮)

is a categorical equivalence. Because S is a simplex, the left side may be identiﬁed with a full subcategory
of Y X and the right side with a full subcategory of Y M(φ). Since q is a categorical equivalence, the natural
map Y X → Y M(φ) is a categorical equivalence; thus, to complete the proof, it suﬃces to observe that a map
of simplicial sets f : X → Y is compatible with the projection to S and preserves marked edges if and only
if q ◦ f has the same properties.

equivalence from Set+

∆ to itself.

∆ → Set+

∆ has a right adjoint U , and the pair (T, U ) is a Quillen

Proof. We have already established the existence of the unstraightening functor U in §3.2.1, and proved that
(T, U ) is a Quillen adjunction. To complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that the left derived functor of T
(which we may identify with T , since every object of Set+
∆ is coﬁbrant) is an equivalence from the homotopy
category of Set+

The horizontal arrows are marked anodyne. It therefore suﬃces to show that

∆n(∆{n−1,n})♯

induces Cartesian equivalences when evaluated at any i < n. This follows from an easy computation.

Choose a ﬁbrant replacement for X: that is, a Cartesian equivalence X → Y ♮ where Y → ∆n is a

Cartesian ﬁbration. According to Proposition 3.2.2.7, there exists a composable sequence of maps

θ : A0 ← . . . ← An

and a quasi-equivalence M ♮(θ) → Y ♮. Proposition 3.2.2.14 implies that M ♮(θ) → Y ♮ is a Cartesian equiva-

∆n F)s with U (F(s)), where U is the right adjoint to T . By Lemma
3.2.3.1, Xs → U (F(s)) is a Cartesian equivalence if and only if the adjoint map T (Xs) → F(s) is a Cartesian
equivalence. This map factors as a composition

T (Xs) → St+

∆n(X)(s) → F(s).

The map on the left is a Cartesian equivalence by Lemma 3.2.3.3, and the map on the right in virtue of the
assumption that St+

3.2.4 Straightening in the General Case
Let S be a simplicial set and φ : C[S] → Cop an equivalence of simplicial categories. Our goal in this section
is to complete the proof of Theorem 3.2.0.1 by showing that (St+
φ ) is a Quillen equivalence between
∆)C. In §3.2.3, we handled the case where S was a simplex (and φ an isomorphism), by
(Set+
verifying that the unit map id → RU n+

φ is an isomorphism of functors from h(Set+

∆)/S and (Set+

∆)/S to itself.

φ induces an equivalence from the homotopy category of (Set+

∆)/S. According to Proposition 3.2.3.4, this is true whenever S is a simplex. In the general case, we
∆)/S as somehow built out of pieces which are associated to simplices,
φ is an equivalence because it is an equivalence on each piece. In order to make this
∆)/S, but

the pair (φ!, φ∗) is a Quillen equivalence between (Set+

of (Set+
would like to regard (Set+
and deduce that U n+
argument work, it is necessary to work not just with the homotopy categories of (Set+
with the simplicial categories which give rise to them.

∆)C and (Set+

∆)C and (Set+

and (Set+

We recall that both (Set+

∆)C and (Set+

∆)/S are simplicial model categories with respect to the simplicial

mapping spaces deﬁned by

HomSet∆(K, Map(Set+

∆)C(F, G)) = Hom(Set+

∆)C (F ⊠K ♯, G)

HomSet∆ (K, Map(Set+

∆)S

(X, Y )) = HomSet∆ (K, Map♯

S(X, Y )) = Hom(Set+

∆)/S

(X × K ♯, Y ).

The functor St+
in the sense that there is a natural map

φ is not a simplicial functor. However, it is weakly compatible with the simplicial structure

St+

φ (X ⊠ K ♯) → (St+

φ X) ⊠ K ♯

for any X ∈ (Set+
Passing to adjoints, we get natural maps

∆)/S, K ∈ Set∆ (according to Corollary 3.2.1.15, this map is a weak equivalence in (Set+

∆)C).

Map(Set+

∆)C(F, G) → Map♯

S(U n+

φ F, U n+

φ G).

In other words, U n+
deduce the following:

φ does have the structure of a simplicial functor. We now invoke Proposition A.3.1.10 to

Lemma 3.2.4.1. Let S be a simplicial set, C a simplicial category, and φ : C[S] → Cop a simplicial functor.
The following are equivalent:

(1) The Quillen adjunction (St+

φ , U n+

φ ) is a Quillen equivalence.

161

(2) The functor U n+

φ induces an equivalence of simplicial categories

(U n+

φ )◦ : ((Set+

where ((Set+

∆)/S)◦ denotes the full (simplicial) subcategory of (Set+

∆)C) consisting of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant
∆)/S consisting of ﬁbrant-

Consequently, to complete the proof of Theorem 3.2.0.1, it will suﬃce to show that if φ is an equivalence
φ )◦ is an equivalence of simplicial categories. The ﬁrst step is to prove that

of simplicial categories, then (U n+
(U n+

φ )◦ is fully faithful.

Lemma 3.2.4.2. Let S′ ⊆ S be simplicial sets, and let p : X → S, q : Y → S be Cartesian ﬁbrations. Let
X ′ = X ×S S′ and Y ′ = Y ×S S′. The restriction map

Map♯

S(X ♮, Y ♮) → Map♯

S′(X ′♮, Y ′♮)

is a Kan ﬁbration.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that the map Y ♮ → S has the right lifting property with respect to the inclusion

(X ′♮ × B♯)

(X ♮ × A♯) ⊆ X ♮ × B♯,

aX ′ ♮×A♯
for any anodyne inclusion of simplicial sets A ⊆ B.

But this is a smash product of a marked coﬁbration X ′♮ → X ♮ (in (Set+

∆)/S) and a trivial marked
∆), and is therefore a trivial marked coﬁbration. We conclude by observing that
∆)/S (Proposition 3.1.4.1).

an equivalence of simplicial categories. Lemma A.3.6.17 implies that the left vertical map is an equivalence.
Using Lemma 2.2.3.6 and Remark A.3.2.14, we deduce that the right vertical map is also an equivalence. It
will therefore suﬃce to show that φS is an equivalence.

Let U denote the collection of simplicial sets S for which φS is an equivalence. We will show that U
satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 2.2.3.5, and therefore contains every simplicial set S. Conditions (i) and
(ii) are obviously satisﬁed, and condition (iii) follows from Lemma 3.2.4.1 and Proposition 3.2.3.4. We will
verify condition (iv); the proof of (v) is similar.

φ which does not share this
defect. Our goal in this section is to introduce this simpler construction, which we call the marked relative
nerve F 7→ N+

F (C), and to study its basic properties.

Remark 3.2.5.1. To simplify the exposition which follows, the relative nerve functor introduced below will
actually be an alternative to the opposite of the unstraightening functor

F 7→ (U n+

φ Fop)op,

which is a right Quillen functor from the projective model structure on (Set+
structure on (Set+

∆)/ N(C).

∆)C to the coCartesian model

Deﬁnition 3.2.5.2. Let C be a small category, and let f : C → Set∆ be a functor. We deﬁne a simplicial
set Nf (C), the nerve of C relative to f , as follows. For every nonempty ﬁnite linearly ordered set J, a map
∆J → Nf (C) consists of the following data:

(1) A functor σ from J to C.
(2) For every nonempty subset J ′ ⊆ J having a maximal element j′, a map τ (J ′) : ∆J ′

→ F(σ(j′)).

(3) For nonempty subsets J ′′ ⊆ J ′ ⊆ J, with maximal elements j′′ ∈ J ′′, j′ ∈ J ′, the diagram

∆J ′′

τ (J ′′)

f (σ(j′′))

∆J ′

τ (J ′)

/ f (σ(j′))

is required to commute.

Remark 3.2.5.3. Let I be denote the linearly ordered set [n], regarded as a category, and let f : I → Set∆
correspond to a composable sequence of morphisms φ : X0 → . . . → Xn. Then Nf (I) is closely related to the
mapping simplex M op(φ) introduced in §3.2.2. More precisely, there is a canonical map Nf (I) → M op(φ)
compatible with the projection to ∆n, which induces an isomorphism on each ﬁber.

Remark 3.2.5.4. The simplicial set Nf (C) of Deﬁnition 3.2.5.2 depends functorially on f . When f takes
the constant value ∆0, there is a canonical isomorphism Nf (C) ≃ N(C). In particular, for any functor f ,
there is a canonical map Nf (C) → N(C); the ﬁber of this map over an object C ∈ C can be identiﬁed with
the simpicial set f (C).

Remark 3.2.5.5. Let C be a small ∞-category. The construction f 7→ Nf (C) determines a functor from
(Set∆)C to (Set∆)/ N(C). This functor admits a left adjoint, which we will denote by X 7→ FX (C) (the
existence of this functor follows from the adjoint functor theorem). If X → N(C) is a left ﬁbration, then
FX (C) is a functor C → Set∆ which assigns to each C ∈ C a simplicial set which is weakly equivalent to the
ﬁber XC = X ×N(C) {C}; this follows from Proposition 3.2.5.18 below.
Example 3.2.5.6. Let C be a small category, and regard N(C) as an object of (Set∆)/ N(C) via the identity
map. Then FN(C)(C) ∈ (Set∆)C can be identiﬁed with the functor C 7→ N(C/C ).
Remark 3.2.5.7. Let g : C → D be a functor between small categories and let f : D → Set∆ be a diagram.
There is a canonical isomorphism of simplicial sets Nf ◦g(C) ≃ Nf (D)×N(D)N(C). In other words, the diagram
of categories

the functor given by pullback along the map of simplicial sets N(g) : N(C) → N(D).

Remark 3.2.5.8. Combining Remarks 3.2.5.5 and 3.2.5.7, we deduce that for any functor g : C → D
between small categories, the diagram of left adjoints

(Set∆)D

g!

(Set∆)C

F•(D)

F•(C)

(Set∆)/ N(C)

commutes up to canonical isomorphism; here g! denotes the functor of left Kan extension along g, and the
bottom arrow is the forgetful functor given by composition with N(g) : N(C) → N(D).

Notation 3.2.5.9. Let C be a small category, and let f : C → Set∆ be a functor. We let f op denote the
functor C → Set∆ described by the formula f op(C) = f (C)op. We will use a similar notation in the case
where f is a functor from C to the category Set+

∆ of marked simplicial sets.

Remark 3.2.5.10. Let C be a small category, let S = N(C)op, and let φ : C[S] → Cop be the counit map.
For each X ∈ (Set∆)/ N(C), there is a canonical map

αC(X) : StφX op → FX (C)op.

The collection of maps {αC(X)} is uniquely determined by the following requirements:

(1) The morphism αC(X) depends functorially on X. More precisely, suppose given a commutative diagram

of simplicial sets

Then the diagram

(2) The transformation αC depends functorially on C in the following sense: for every functor g : C → D,

if φ′ : C[(N D)op] → Dop denotes the counit map and X ∈ (Set∆)/ N(C), then the diagram

StφX op

(3) Let C be the category associated to a partially ordered set P , and let X = N(C), regarded as an object
of (Set∆)/ N(C) via the identity map. Then (StφX op) ∈ (Set∆)C can be identiﬁed with the functor
p 7→ N Xp, where for each p ∈ P we let Xp denote the collection of nonempty ﬁnite chains in P having
largest element p. Similarly, Example 3.2.5.6 allows us to identify FX (C) ∈ (Set∆)C with the functor
p 7→ N{q ∈ P : q ≤ p}. The map αC(X) : (StφX op) → FX (C)op is induced by the map of partially
ordered sets Xp → {q ∈ P : q ≤ p} which carries every chain to its smallest element.

To see that the collection of maps {αC(X)}X∈(Set∆)/ N(C) is determined by these properties, we ﬁrst note
that because the functors Stφ and F•(C) commute with colimits, any natural transformation βC : Stφ(•op) →
F•(C)op is determined by its values βC(X) : Stφ(X op) → FX(C)op in the case where X = ∆n is a simplex.
In this case, any map X → N C factors through the isomorphism X ≃ N[n], so we can use property (2) to
reduce to the case where the category C is a partially ordered set and the map X → N(C) is an isomorphism.
The behavior of the natural transformation αC is then dictated by property (3). This proves the uniqueness
of the natural transformations αC; the existence follows by a similar argument.

The following result summarizes some of the basic properties of the relative nerve functor:

Lemma 3.2.5.11. Let I be a category and let α : f → f ′ be a natural transformation of functors f, f ′ : C →
Set∆.

(1) Suppose that, for each I ∈ C, the map α(I) : f (I) → f ′(I) is an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Then

the induced map Nf (C) → Nf ′ (C) is an inner ﬁbration.

(2) Suppose that, for each I ∈ I, the simplicial set f (I) is an ∞-category. Then Nf (C) is an ∞-category.

(3) Suppose that, for each I ∈ C, the map α(I) : f (I) → f ′(I) is a categorical ﬁbration of ∞-categories.

Then the induced map Nf (C) → Nf ′(C) is a categorical ﬁbration of ∞-categories.

Proof. Consider a commutative diagram

If α(I) is an inner ﬁbration and 0 < i < n, then we conclude that this lifting problem admits a solution.
This proves (1). To prove (2), we apply (1) in the special case where f ′ is the constant functor taking the
value ∆0. It follows that Nf (C) → N(C) is an inner ﬁbration, so that Nf (C) is an ∞-category.

We now prove (3). According to Corollary 2.4.6.5, an inner ﬁbration D → E of ∞-categories is a

categorical ﬁbration if and only if the following condition is satisﬁed:

(∗) For every equivalence e : E → E′ in E, and every object D ∈ D lifting E, there exists an equivalence

e : D → D′ in D lifting e.

We can identify equivalences in Nf ′ (C) with triples (g : I → I ′, X, e : X ′ → Y ) where g is an isomorphism
in C, X is an object of f ′(I), X ′ is the image of X in f ′(I ′), and e : X ′ → Y is an equivalence in f ′(I ′).
Given a lifting X of X to f (I), we can apply the assumption that α(I ′) is a categorical ﬁbration (and
→ Y in f (I ′). This produces the desired equivalence
Corollary 2.4.6.5) to lift e to an equivalence e : X

collection of all edges e of Nf (C) with the following property: if e : C → C′ is the image of e in N(C), and
σ denotes the edge of f (C′) determined by e, then σ is a marked edge of F(C′). We will refer to N+

F′ (C), the image of σ in F′(C′) is marked. Since the map F(C′) → F′(C′) is a trivial ﬁbration

X ≃ X ♭.

(2) Let e be an edge of Nf (C), covering a morphism C → C′ in C. Then e is p-coCartesian if and only if

the corresponding edge of f (C′) is an equivalence.

3.3 Applications

The purpose of this section is to survey some applications of technology developed in §3.1 and §3.2. In §3.3.1,
we give some applications to the theory of Cartesian ﬁbrations. In §3.3.2, we will introduce the language of
classifying maps which will allow us to exploit the Quillen equivalence provided by Theorem 3.2.0.1. Finally,
in §3.3.3 and §3.3.4, we will use Theorem 3.2.0.1 to give explicit constructions of limits and colimits in the
∞-category Cat∞ (and also in the ∞-category S of spaces).

3.3.1 Structure Theory for Cartesian Fibrations

The purpose of this section is to prove that Cartesian ﬁbrations between simplicial sets enjoy several pleasant
properties. For example, every Cartesian ﬁbration is a categorical ﬁbration (Proposition 3.3.1.7), and cate-
gorical equivalences are stable under pullbacks by Cartesian ﬁbrations (Proposition 3.3.1.3). These results
are fairly easy to prove for Cartesian ﬁbrations X → S in the case where S is an ∞-category. Theorem
3.2.0.1 provides a method for reducing to this special case:

Proposition 3.3.1.1. Let p : S → T be a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets. Then the forgetful
functor

∆)/T
and its right adjoint p∗ induce a Quillen equivalence between (Set+

∆)/S → (Set+

p! : (Set+

∆)/S and (Set+

∆)/T .

Proof. Let C = C[S]op and D = C[T ]op. Consider the diagram of model categories and left Quillen functors:

(Set+

∆)/S

p!

(Set+

∆)/T

.

St+
S

C

C[p]!

St+
T

/ D

According to Proposition 3.2.1.4, this diagram commutes (up to natural isomorphism). Theorem 3.2.0.1
implies that the vertical arrows are Quillen equivalences. Since p is a categorical equivalence, C[p] is an
equivalence of simplicial categories, so that C[p]! is a Quillen equivalence (Proposition A.3.3.8). It follows
that (p!, p∗) is a Quillen equivalence as well.

Corollary 3.3.1.2. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and let S → T be a categorical
equivalence. Then there exists a Cartesian ﬁbration Y → T , and an equivalence of X with S ×T Y (as
Cartesian ﬁbrations over X).

Proof. Proposition 3.3.1.1 implies that the right derived functor Rp∗ is essentially surjective.

As we explained in Remark 2.2.5.3, the Joyal model structure on Set∆ is not right proper.

In other
words, it is possible to have a categorical ﬁbration X → S and a categorical equivalence T → S such that
the induced map X ×S T → X is not a categorical equivalence. This poor behavior of categorical ﬁbrations
is one of the reason that they do not play a prominent role in the theory of ∞-categories. Working with a
stronger notion of ﬁbration corrects the problem:

Proposition 3.3.1.3. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration, and let T → S be a categorical equivalence.
Then the induced map X ×S T → X is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. We ﬁrst suppose that the map T → S is inner anodyne. By means of a simple argument, we may
i ⊆ ∆n, where 0 < i < n. According Proposition
reduce to the case where T → S is a middle horn inclusion Λn
3.2.2.7, there exists a sequence of maps

φ : A0 ← . . . ← An

(cid:15)

and a map M (φ) → X which is a categorical equivalence, such that M (φ) ×S T → X ×S T is also a
categorical equivalence. Consequently, it suﬃces to show that the inclusion M (φ) ×S T ⊆ M (φ) is a
i ⊆ An × ∆n, which is inner
categorical equivalence. But this map is a pushout of the inclusion An × Λn
anodyne.

We now treat the general case. Choose an inner anodyne map T → T ′ where T ′ is an ∞-category. Then
T S → S′, where S′ is also an ∞-category. The map S → S′ is inner
choose an inner anodyne map T ′
anodyne; in particular it is a categorical equivalence, so by Corollary 3.3.1.2 there is a Cartesian ﬁbration
X ′ → S′ and an equivalence X → X ′ ×S′ S of Cartesian ﬁbrations over S. We have a commutative diagram

Consequently, to prove that v is a categorical equivalence, it suﬃces to show that every other arrow in
the diagram is a categorical equivalence. The maps u and v′ are equivalences of Cartesian ﬁbrations, and
therefore categorical equivalences. The other three maps are special cases of the assertion we are trying
to prove., For the map u′′, we are in the special case of the map S′ → T ′, which is an equivalence of ∞-
categories: in this case we simply apply Corollary 2.4.4.5. For the maps u′ and v′′, we need to know that the
assertion of the proposition is valid in the special case of the maps S → S′ and T → T ′. Since these maps
are inner anodyne, the proof is complete.

Corollary 3.3.1.4. Let

X

S

X ′

p′

/ S′

be a pullback diagram of simplicial sets, where p′ is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Then the diagram is homotopy
Cartesian (with respect to the Joyal model structure).

Proof. Choose a categorical equivalence S′ → S′′, where S′′ is an ∞-category. Using Proposition 3.3.1.1, we
may assume without loss of generality that X ′ ≃ X ′′ ×S′′ S′, where X ′′ → S′′ is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Now
choose a factorization

S θ′

→ T θ′′

→ S′′

where θ′ is a categorical equivalence and θ′′ is a categorical ﬁbration. The diagram

T → S′′ ← X ′′

is ﬁbrant. Consequently, the desired conclusion is equivalent to the assertion that the map X → T ×S′′ X ′′
is a categorical equivalence, which follows immediately from Proposition 3.3.1.3.

We now prove a stronger version of Corollary 2.4.4.4, which does not require that the base S is a ∞-

category.

where p and q are Cartesian ﬁbrations, and f carries p-Cartesian edges to q-Cartesian edges. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map f is a categorical equivalence.

(2) For each vertex s of S, f induces a categorical equivalence Xs → Ys.

(3) The map X ♮ → Y ♮ is a Cartesian equivalence in (Set+

∆)/S.

Proof. The equivalence of (2) and (3) follows from Proposition 3.1.3.5. We next show that (2) implies (1).
In virtue of Proposition 3.2.2.8, we may reduce to the case where S is a simplex. Then S is an ∞-category
and the desired result follows from Corollary 2.4.4.4. (Alternatively, we could observe that (2) implies that
f has a homotopy inverse.)

To prove that (1) implies (3), we choose an inner anodyne map j : S → S′, where S′ is an ∞-category. Let
X ♮ denote the object of (Set+
∆)/S associated to the Cartesian ﬁbration p : X → S, and let j!X ♮ denote the
∆)/T . Choose a marked anodyne map j!X ♮ → X ′♮,
same marked simplicial set, regarded as an object of (Set+
where X ′ → S′ is a Cartesian ﬁbration. By Proposition 3.3.1.1, the map X ♮ → j∗X ′♮ is a Cartesian
equivalence, so that X → X ′ ×S′ S is a categorical equivalence. According to Proposition 3.3.1.3, the map
X ′ ×S′ S → X ′ is a categorical equivalence; thus the composite map X → X ′ is a categorical equivalence.

Similarly, we may choose a marked anodyne map

X ′♮

j!Y ♮ → Y ′♮

aj!X ♮

for some Cartesian ﬁbration Y ′ → S′. Since the Cartesian model structure is left-proper, the map j!Y ♮ → Y ′♮
is a Cartesian equivalence, so we may argue as above to deduce that Y → Y ′ is a categorical equivalence.
Now consider the diagram

We have argued that the vertical maps are categorical equivalences. The map f is a categorical equivalence
by assumption. It follows that f ′ is a categorical equivalence. Since S′ is an ∞-category, we may apply

Proof. Consider a diagram

Corollary 3.3.1.2, there exists a Cartesian ﬁbration q : Y → T such that Y ×T S is equivalent to X. Thus,

Consider the composite map

Since f ′ is homotopic to f ′′, and v ◦ u is homotopic to the identity, we conclude that f ′′′|A is homotopic to
f0 (via a homotopy which is ﬁxed over S). Since p is a Cartesian ﬁbration, we can extend h to a homotopy
from f ′′′ to the desired map f .

In general, the converse to Proposition 3.3.1.7 fails: a categorical ﬁbration of simplicial sets X → S need
not be a Cartesian ﬁbration. This is clear, since the property of being a categorical ﬁbration is self-dual
while the condition of being a Cartesian ﬁbration is not. However, in the case where S is a Kan complex,
the theory of Cartesian ﬁbrations is self-dual, and we have the following result:

Proposition 3.3.1.8. Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets, where S is a Kan complex. The following
assertions are equivalent:

(1) The map p is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

(2) The map p is a coCartesian ﬁbration.

(3) The map p is a categorical ﬁbration.

Proof. We will prove that (1) is equivalent to (3); the equivalence of (2) and (3) follows from a dual argument.
Proposition 3.3.1.7 shows that (1) implies (3) (for this implication, the assumption that S is a Kan complex
is not needed).

Now suppose that (3) holds. Then X is an ∞-category. Since every edge of S is an equivalence, the
p-Cartesian edges of X are precisely the equivalences in X. It therefore suﬃces to show that if if y is a
vertex of X and e : x → p(y) is an edge of S, then e lifts to an equivalence e : x → y in S. Since S is a Kan
complex, we can ﬁnd a contractible Kan complex K and a map q : K → S such that e is the image of an
edge e′ : x′ → y′ in K. The inclusion {y′} ⊆ K is a categorical equivalence; since p is a categorical ﬁbration,
we can lift q to a map q : K → X with q(y′) = y. Then e = q(e′) has the desired properties.

3.3.2 Universal Fibrations

In this section, we will apply Theorem 3.2.0.1 to construct a universal Cartesian ﬁbration. Recall that Cat∞
is deﬁned to be the nerve of the simplicial category Cat∆
∆)◦ of ∞-categories. In particular, we
∆)Cat∆
may regard the inclusion Cat∆
∞. Applying the
, we obtain a ﬁbrant object of (Set+
unstraightening functor U n+
∞ , which we may identify with
Catop
∞
Cartesian ﬁbration q : Z → Catop
∞. We will refer to q as the universal Cartesian ﬁbration. We observe that
the objects of Cat∞ can be identiﬁed with ∞-categories, and that the ﬁber of q over an ∞-category C can be
identiﬁed with U (C), where U is the functor described in Lemma 3.2.3.1. In particular, there is a canonical
equivalence of ∞-categories

∞ = (Set+
∆ as a (projectively) ﬁbrant object F ∈ (Set+

∞ ֒→ Set+

∆)/ Catop

Thus we may think of q as a Cartesian ﬁbration which associates to each object of Cat∞ the associated
∞-category.

C → U (C) = Z ×Catop

∞ {C}.

Remark 3.3.2.1. The ∞-categories Cat∞ and Z are large. However, the universal Cartesian ﬁbration q is
small in the sense that for any small simplicial set S and any map f : S → Catop
∞, the ﬁber product S ×Qop Z
is small. This is because the ﬁber product can be identiﬁed with U n+

Deﬁnition 3.3.2.2. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. We will say that a functor
f : S → Catop

∞ classiﬁes p if there is an equivalence of Cartesian ﬁbrations X → Z ×Catop

∞ S ≃ U n+

Dually, if p : X → S is a coCartesian ﬁbration, then we will say that a functor f : S → Cat∞ classiﬁes p

S f .

if f op classiﬁes the Cartesian ﬁbration pop : X op → Sop.

Remark 3.3.2.3. Every Cartesian ﬁbration X → S between small simplicial sets admits a classifying map
φ : S → Catop
∞, which is uniquely determined up to equivalence. This is one expression of the idea that
Z → Catop
∞ is a universal Cartesian ﬁbration. However, it is not immediately obvious that this property
characterizes Cat∞ up to equivalence, because Cat∞ is not itself small. To remedy the situation, let us
consider an arbitrary uncountable regular cardinal κ, and let Cat∞(κ) denote the full subcategory of Cat∞
spanned by the κ-small ∞-categories. We then deduce the following:

(∗) Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration between small simplicial sets. Then p is classiﬁed by a functor
χ : S → Cat∞(κ)op if and only if, for every vertex s ∈ S, the ﬁber Xs is essentially κ-small. In this
case, χ is determined uniquely up to homotopy.

Enlarging the universe and applying (∗) in the case where κ is the supremum of all small cardinals, we
deduce the following property:

(∗′) Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration between simplicial sets which are not necessarily small. Then p
∞ if and only if, for every vertex s ∈ S, the ﬁber Xs is essentially

is classiﬁed by a functor χ : S → Catop
small. In this case, χ is determined uniquely up to homotopy.

This property evidently determines the ∞-category Cat∞ (and the Cartesian ﬁbration q : Z → Catop
equivalence.

∞) up to

Warning 3.3.2.4. The terminology of Deﬁnition 3.3.2.2 has the potential to cause confusion in the case
where p : X → S is both a Cartesian ﬁbration and a coCartesian ﬁbration. In this case, p is classiﬁed both
by a functor S → Catop
∞ (as a Cartesian ﬁbration) and by a functor S → Cat∞ (as a coCartesian ﬁbration).
The category Kan of Kan complexes can be identiﬁed with a full (simplicial) subcategory of Cat∆
∞.
Consequently we may identify the ∞-category S of spaces with the full simplicial subset of Cat∞, spanned
Sop be the restriction of the universal
by the vertices which represent ∞-groupoids. We let Z0 = Z ×Catop
Cartesian ﬁbration. The ﬁbers of q0 : Z0 → Sop are Kan complexes (since they are equivalent to the ∞-
categories represented by the vertices of S). It follows from Proposition 2.4.2.4 that q0 is a right ﬁbration.
We will refer to q0 as the universal right ﬁbration.

∞

Proposition 2.4.2.4 translates immediately into the following characterization of right ﬁbrations:

Proposition 3.3.2.5. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. The following conditions
are equivalent:

(1) The map p is a right ﬁbration.

(2) Every functor f : S → Catop

∞ which classiﬁes p factors through Sop ⊆ Catop
∞.

(3) There exists a functor f : S → Sop which classiﬁes p.

Consequently, we may speak of right ﬁbrations X → S being classiﬁed by functors S → Sop, and left

ﬁbrations being classiﬁed by functors S → S.

The ∞-category ∆0 corresponds to a vertex of Cat∞ which we will denote by ∗. The ﬁber of q over this
point may be identiﬁed with U ∆0 ≃ ∆0; consequently, there is a unique vertex ∗Z of Z lying over ∗. We
note that ∗ and ∗Z belong to the subcategories S and Z0. Moreover, we have the following:

176

Proposition 3.3.2.6. Let q0 : Z0 → Sop be the universal right ﬁbration. The vertex ∗Z is a ﬁnal object of
the ∞-category Z0.
Proof. Let n > 0, and let f0 : ∂ ∆n → Z0 have the property that f0 carries the ﬁnal vertex of ∆n to ∗Z. We
wish to show that there exists an extension

(in which case the map f automatically factors through Z0).
Let D denote the simplicial category containing Sop

object X, with the morphisms given by

∆ as a full subcategory, together with one additional

MapD(K, X) = K

MapD(X, X) = ∗

MapD(X, K) = ∅

for all K ∈ Sop
∆ . Let C = C[∆n ⋆ ∆0], and let C0 denote the full subcategory C0 = C[∂ ∆n ⋆ ∆0]. We will
denote the objects of C by {v0, . . . , vn+1}. Giving the map f0 is tantamount to giving a simplicial functor
F0 : C0 → D with F0(vn+1) = X, and constructing f amounts to giving a simplicial functor F : C → D
which extends F0.

We note that the inclusion MapC0 (vi, vj) → MapC(vi, vj) is an isomorphism, unless i = 0 and j ∈

{n, n + 1}. Consequently, to deﬁne F , it suﬃces to ﬁnd extensions

MapC0 (v0, vn)

MapD(F0(v0), F0(vn))

such that the following diagram commutes:

MapC(v0, vn) × MapC(vn, vn+1)

MapD(F0(v0), F0(vn)) × MapD(F0(vn), F0(vn+1))

MapC(v0, vn+1)

/ MapD(F0(v0), F0(vn+1)).

We note that MapC(vn, vn+1) is a point. In view of the assumption that f0 carries the ﬁnal vertex of
∆n to ∗Z, we see that MapD(F (vn), F (vn+1)) is a point. It follows that, for any ﬁxed choice of j′, there
is a unique choice of j for which the above diagram commutes. It therefore suﬃces to show that j′ exists.
Since MapD(F0(v0), X) is a Kan complex, it will suﬃce to show that the inclusion MapC0(v0, vn+1) →
MapC(v0, vn+1) is an anodyne map of simplicial sets. In fact, it is isomorphic to the inclusion

({1} × (∆1)n−1)

(∆1 × ∂(∆1)n−1) ⊆ ∆1 × ∆n−1,

a{1}×∂(∆1)n−1

which is the smash product of the coﬁbration ∂(∆1)n−1 ⊆ (∆1)n−1 with the anodyne inclusion {1} ⊆ ∆1.

Proof. Combine Propositions 3.3.2.6 and 4.4.4.5.

Corollary 3.3.2.8. Let p : X → S be a left ﬁbration between small simplicial sets. Then there exists a map

3.3.3 Limits of ∞-Categories
The ∞-category Cat∞ can be identiﬁed with the simplicial nerve of (Set+
∆)◦. It follows from Corollary 4.2.4.8
that Cat∞ admits (small) limits and colimits, which can be computed in terms of homotopy (co)limits in
the model category Set+
∆. For many applications, it is convenient to be able to construct limits and colimits
while working entirely in the setting of ∞-categories. We will describe the construction of limits in this
section; the case of colimits will be discussed in §3.3.4.

Let p : Sop → Cat∞ be a diagram in Cat∞. Then p classiﬁes a Cartesian ﬁbration q : X → S. We
(p) ∈ Cat∞ can be identiﬁed with the ∞-category of

∞ a diagram in the ∞-category of spaces,
X → K ⊲ a Cartesian ﬁbration classiﬁed by p, and X = X ×K ⊲ K. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The diagram p is a colimit of p = p|K.

(2) The restriction map

is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

θ : Map♭

K ⊲ ((K ⊲)♯, X

♮

) → Map♭

K(K ♯, X ♮)

Proof. According to Proposition 4.2.3.14, there exists a small category C and a coﬁnal map f : N(C) → K;
let C = C ⋆[0] be the category obtained from C by adjoining a new ﬁnal object, and let f : N(C) → K ⊲ be
the induced map (which is also coﬁnal). The maps f and f are contravariant equivalences in (Set∆)/K ⊲ , and
therefore induce Cartesian equivalences

We have a commutative diagram

N(C)♯ → K ♯

N(C)♯ → (K ⊲)♯.

Using Proposition 3.3.3.1, we can easily deduce an analogous characterization of limits in the ∞-category

Corollary 3.3.3.3. Let K be a simplicial set, p : K ⊳ → S a diagram in the ∞-category of spaces, and
X → K ⊳ a left ﬁbration classiﬁed by p. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The diagram p is a limit of p = p|K.

(2) The restriction map

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes.

MapK ⊳ (K ⊳, X) → MapK ⊳ (K, X)

Proof. The usual model structure on Set∆ is a localization of the Joyal model structure. It follows that
the inclusion Kan ⊆ Cat∆
∞ preserves homotopy limits (of diagrams indexed by categories). Using Theorem
4.2.4.1, Proposition 4.2.3.14, and Corollary 4.2.4.7, we conclude that the inclusion S ⊆ Cat∞ preserves
(small) limits. The desired equivalence now follows immediately from Proposition 3.3.3.1.

Corollary 3.3.3.4. Let p : K → S be a diagram in the ∞-category S of spaces, and let X → K be a left

3.3.4 Colimits of ∞-Categories

In this section, we will address the problem of constructing colimits in the ∞-category Cat∞. Let p :
Sop → Cat∞ be diagram, classifying a Cartesian ﬁbration f : X → S. In §3.3.3, we saw that lim
(p) can be
←−
identiﬁed with the ∞-category of Cartesian sections of f . To construct the colimit lim
(p), we need to ﬁnd an
−→
∞-category which admits a map from each ﬁber Xs. The natural candidate, of course, is X itself. However,
because X is generally not an ∞-category, we must take some care to formulate a correct statement.

Lemma 3.3.4.1. Let

Proof. Choose a coﬁbration S′ → K, where K is a contractible Kan complex. The map q factors as a
composition

S′ q′

→ S × K

q′′
→ S.

It is obvious that the projection X ♮ × K ♯ → X ♮ is a Cartesian equivalence. We may therefore replace S by
S × K and q by q′, thereby reducing to the case where q is a coﬁbration. Proposition 4.1.1.3 now implies
that q is left-anodyne. It is easy to see that the collection of coﬁbrations q : S′ → S for which the desired
conclusion holds is weakly saturated. We may therefore reduce to the case where q is a horn inclusion
Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, where 0 ≤ i < n.

We now apply Proposition 3.2.2.7 to choose a sequence of composable maps

and a quasi-equivalence M (φ) → X. We have a commutative diagram of marked simplicial sets

φ : A0 ← . . . ← An

Using Proposition 3.2.2.14, we deduce that the horizontal maps are Cartesian equivalences. To complete
the proof, it will suﬃce to show that i is a Cartesian equivalence. We now observe that i is a pushout of
i )♯ × (An)♭ ⊆ (∆n)♯ × (An)♭. It will therefore suﬃce to prove that i′′ is a Cartesian
the inclusion i′′ : (Λn
equivalence. Using Proposition 3.1.4.2, we are reduced to proving that the inclusion (Λn
i )♯ ⊆ (∆n)♯ is a
Cartesian equivalence. According to Proposition 3.1.5.7, this is equivalent to the assertion that the horn
inclusion Λn

i ⊆ ∆n is a weak homotopy equivalence, which is obvious.

Proposition 3.3.4.2. Let K be a simplicial set, p : K ⊳ → Catop
∞ be a diagram in the ∞-category Cat∞,
X → K ⊳ a Cartesian ﬁbration classiﬁed by p, and X = X ×K ⊳ K. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The diagram p is a limit of p = p|K.

(2) The inclusion X ♮ ⊆ X

(3) The inclusion X ♮ ⊆ X

Since i is a Cartesian equivalence in (Set+

equivalence of Cartesian ﬁbrations over K ⊳. Since q induces an isomorphism over each vertex of K, this is
equivalent to:

(2′) The map qv : Yv → X v is an equivalence of ∞-categories, where v denotes the cone point of K ⊳.

Lemma 3.3.4.1 implies that the vertical maps are Cartesian equivalences. It follows that (2′) ⇔ (3), so that
(2) ⇔ (3).

To complete the proof, we will show that (1) ⇔ (2). According to Proposition 4.2.3.14, there exists a
small category C and a map p : N(C) → K such that pop is coﬁnal. Let C = [0] ⋆ C be the category obtained
by adjoining an initial object to C. Consider the diagram

Lemma 3.3.4.1 implies that the vertical maps are Cartesian equivalences (in Set+
∆). It follows that the upper
horizontal inclusion is a Cartesian equivalence if and only if the lower horizontal inclusion is a Cartesian
equivalence. Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove the equivalence (1) ⇔ (2) after replacing K by N(C).
Using Corollary 4.2.4.7, we may further suppose that p is the nerve of a functor F : C → (Set+

∆)◦. Let
φ : C[K ⊳] → C be the counit map, and let φ : C[K] → C be the restriction of φ. Without loss of generality, we

where G and G′ are restriction functors. Let F and F ′ be the left adjoints to G and G′, respectively.
According to Theorem 4.2.4.1, assumption (1) is equivalent to the assertion that F lies in the essential image
of F . Since each of the vertical functors is equivalence of categories (Theorem 3.2.0.1), this is equivalent
to the assertion that X lies in the essential image of F ′. Since F ′ is fully faithful, this is equivalent to the
assertion that the counit map

F ′G′X → X

is an isomorphism in h(Set+

∆)/K ⊳), which is clearly a reformulation of (2).

Corollary 3.3.4.3. Let p : K op → Cat∞ be a diagram, classifying a Cartesian ﬁbration X → K. Then
there is a natural isomorphism lim
−→

(p) ≃ X ♮ in the homotopy category in hCat∞.

Proof. Let p : (K op)⊲ → Cat∞ be a colimit of p, classifying a Cartesian ﬁbration X → K ⊳. Let v denote the
cone point of K ⊳, so that lim
(p) ≃ X v. We now observe that the inclusions

are both Cartesian equivalences (Lemma 3.3.4.1 and Proposition 3.3.4.2).

Warning 3.3.4.4. In the situation of Corollary 3.3.4.3, the marked simplicial set X ♮ is usually not a ﬁbrant
object of Set+

∆, even when K is an ∞-category.

Using exactly the same argument, we can establish a version of Proposition 3.3.4.2 which describes

colimits in the ∞-category of spaces:

Proposition 3.3.4.5. Let K be a simplicial set, p : K ⊲ → S be a diagram in the ∞-category of spaces,
X → K ⊲ a left ﬁbration classiﬁed by p, and X = X ×K ⊲ K. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The diagram p is a colimit of p = p|K.

(2) The inclusion X ⊆ X is a covariant equivalence in (Set∆)/K ⊲ .

(3) The inclusion X ⊆ X is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

Proof. Using the small object argument, we can construct a factorization

i
֒→ Y

j
→ K ⊲

X

where i is left anodyne, j is a left ﬁbration, and the inclusion X ⊆ Y ×K ⊲ K is an isomorphism. Choose a
dotted arrow q as indicated in the diagram

X(cid:127)

i

{

Y

{

q
{

/ X
={

K ⊲.

Since i is a covariant equivalence in (Set∆)/K ⊲ , condition (2) is equivalent to the assertion that q is an
equivalence of left ﬁbrations over K ⊲. Since q induces an isomorphism over each vertex of K, this is
equivalent to the assertion that qv : Yv → X v is an equivalence, where v denotes the cone point of K ⊲. We
have a commutative diagram

Yv

Y

qv

q

X v

/ X.

Proposition 4.1.2.14 implies that the vertical maps are right anodyne, and therefore weak homotopy equiv-
alences. Consequently, qv is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if q is a weak homotopy equivalence.
Since the inclusion X ⊆ Y is a weak homotopy equivalence, this proves that (2) ⇔ (3).

To complete the proof, we will show that (1) ⇔ (2). According to Proposition 4.2.3.14, there exists a
small category C and a coﬁnal map N(C) → K. Let C = C ⋆[0] be the category obtained from C by adjoining
a new ﬁnal object. Consider the diagram

X ×K N(C)(cid:31)

X ×K ⊲ N(C)

X

/ X.

Proposition 4.1.2.14 implies that X → K ⊲ is smooth, so that the vertical arrows in the above diagram are
coﬁnal.
In particular, the vertical arrows are weak homotopy equivalences, so that the upper horizontal
inclusion is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the lower horizontal inclusion is a weak homotopy
equivalence. Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove the equivalence (1) ⇔ (2) after replacing K by N(C).

Using Corollary 4.2.4.7, we may further suppose that p is obtained as the nerve of a functor F : C → Kan.
Let φ : C[K ⊲] → C be the counit map, and let φ : C[K] → C be the restriction of φ. Without loss of

Limits and Colimits

This chapter is devoted to the study of limits and colimits in the ∞-categorical setting. Our goal is to provide
tools for proving the existence of limits and colimits, for analyzing them, and for comparing them to the
(perhaps more familiar) notion of homotopy limits and colimits in simplicial categories. We will generally
conﬁne our remarks to colimits; analogous results for limits can be obtained by passing to the opposite
∞-categories.

We begin in §4.1 by introducing the notion of a coﬁnal map between simplicial sets. If f : A → B is
a coﬁnal map of simplicial sets, then we can identify colimits of a diagram p : B → C with colimits of the
induced diagram p ◦ f : A → C. This is a basic maneuver which will appear repeatedly in the later chapters
of this book. Consequently, it is important to have a good supply of coﬁnal maps. This is guaranteed by
Theorem 4.1.3.1, which can be regarded as an ∞-categorical generalization of Quillen’s “Theorem A”.

In §4.2, we introduce a battery of additional techniques for analyzing colimits. We will explain how to
analyze colimits of complicated diagrams in terms of colimits of simpler diagrams. Using these ideas, we can
often reduce questions about the behavior of arbitrary colimits to questions about a few basic constructions,
which we will analyze explicitly in §4.4. We will also explain the relationship between the ∞-categorical
theory of colimits and the more classical theory of homotopy colimits, which can be studied very eﬀectively
using the language of model categories.

The other major topic of this chapter is the theory of Kan extensions, which can be viewed as relative
versions of limits and colimits. We will study the properties of Kan extensions in §4.3, and prove some
fundamental existence theorems which we will need throughout the later chapters of this book.

Let C be an ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a diagram in C indexed by a simplicial set K. In §1.2.13 we

−→
a simpler diagram without changing the colimit lim
(p). In this section, we will introduce a general formalism
−→
which will allow us to make replacements of this sort: the theory of coﬁnal maps between simplicial sets. We
begin in §4.1.1 with a deﬁnition of the class of coﬁnal maps, and show (Proposition 4.1.1.8) that if a map
q : K ′ → K is coﬁnal, then there is an equivalence lim
(p◦ q) (provided that either colimit exists). In
−→
§4.1.2 we will reformulate the deﬁnition of coﬁnality, using the formalism of contravariant model categories
(§2.1.4). We conclude in §4.1.3 by establishing an important recognition criterion for coﬁnal maps, in the
special case where K is an ∞-category. This result can be regarded as a reﬁnement of Quillen’s “Theorem
A”.

4.1.1 Coﬁnal Maps

The goal of this section is to introduce the deﬁnition of a coﬁnal map p : S → T of simplicial sets, and study
the basic properties of this notion. Our main result is Proposition 4.1.1.8, which characterizes coﬁnality in
terms of the behavior of T -indexed colimits.

Deﬁnition 4.1.1.1 (Joyal [44]). Let p : S → T be a map of simplicial sets. We shall say that p is coﬁnal if,
for any right ﬁbration X → T , the induced map of of simplicial sets

is a homotopy equivalence.

MapT (T, X) → MapT (S, X)

Remark 4.1.1.2. The simplicial set MapT (S, X) parametrizes sections of the right ﬁbration X → T . It
may be described as the ﬁber of the induced map X S → T S over the vertex of T S corresponding to the map
p. Since X S → T S is a right ﬁbration, the ﬁber MapT (S, X) is a Kan complex. Similarly, MapT (T, X) is a
Kan complex.

We begin by recording a few simple observations about the class of coﬁnal maps:

Proposition 4.1.1.3.

(1) Any isomorphism of simplicial sets is coﬁnal.

(2) Let f : K → K ′ and g : K ′ → K ′′ be maps of simplicial sets. Suppose that f is coﬁnal. Then g is

coﬁnal if and only if g ◦ f is coﬁnal.

(3) If f : K → K ′ is a coﬁnal map between simplicial sets, then f is a weak homotopy equivalence.

(4) An inclusion i : K ⊆ K ′ of simplicial sets is coﬁnal if and only if it is right anodyne.

Proof. Assertions (1) and (2) are obvious. We prove (3). Let S be a Kan complex. Since f is coﬁnal, the
composition

MapSet∆(K ′, S) = MapK (K ′, S × K) → MapK(K, S × K) = MapSet∆(K, S)

is a homotopy equivalence. Passing to connected components, we deduce that K and K ′ co-represent the
same functor in the homotopy category H of spaces. It follows that f is a weak homotopy equivalence, as
desired.

We now prove (4). Suppose ﬁrst that i is right-anodyne. Let X → K ′ be a right ﬁbration. Then the
induced map HomK ′(K ′, X) → HomK ′ (K, X) is a trivial ﬁbration, and in particular a homotopy equivalence.

186

Conversely, suppose that i is a coﬁnal inclusion of simplicial sets. We wish to show that i has the left
lifting property with respect to any right ﬁbration. In other words, we must show that given any diagram
of solid arrows

s

{

{

{

K(cid:127)

K ′

/ X
={

K ′,

for which the right-vertical map is a right ﬁbration, there exists a dotted arrow as indicated, rendering the
diagram commutative. Since i is coﬁnal, the map s is homotopic to a map which extends over K ′. In other
words, there exists a map

compatible with the projection to K ′, such that s′|K × {0} coincides with s. Since the inclusion

s′ : (K × ∆1)

(K ′ × {1}) → X,

aK×{1}

(K × ∆1)

(K ′ × {1}) ⊆ K ′ × ∆1

aK×{1}

is right-anodyne, there exists a map s′′ : K ′ × ∆1 → X which extends s′, and is compatible with the
projection to K ′. The map s′′|K × {0} has the desired properties.

Warning 4.1.1.4. The class of coﬁnal maps does not satisfy the “two-out-of-three” property. If f : K → K ′
and g : K ′ → K ′′ are such that g ◦ f and g are coﬁnal, then f need not be coﬁnal.

Our next goal is to establish an alternative characterization of coﬁnality, in terms of the behavior of

colimits (Proposition 4.1.1.8). First, we need a lemma.

Lemma 4.1.1.5. Let C be an ∞-category, and let p : K → C, q : K ′ → C be diagrams. Deﬁne simplicial
sets M and N by the formulas

Hom(X, M ) = {f : (X × K) ⋆ K ′ → C : f |(X × K) = p ◦ πK , f |K ′ = q}

Hom(X, N ) = {g : K ⋆ (X × K ′) → C : f |K = p, f |(X × K ′) = q ◦ πK ′ }.

Here πK and πK ′ denote the projection from a product to the factor indicated by the subscript.

Then M and N are Kan complexes, which are (naturally) homotopy equivalent to one another.

Proof. We deﬁne a simplicial set D as follows. For every ﬁnite, nonempty, linearly ordered set J, to give a
map ∆J → D is to supply the following data:

• A map ∆J → ∆1, corresponding to a decomposition of J as a disjoint union J−

J+, where J− ⊆ J

is closed downwards and J+ ⊆ J is closed upwards.

`

• A map e : (K × ∆J−) ⋆ (K ′ × ∆J+ ) → C such that e|K × ∆J− = p ◦ πK and e|K ′ × ∆J+ = q ◦ πK ′.

We ﬁrst claim that D is an ∞-category. Fix a ﬁnite linearly ordered set J as above, and let j ∈ J be
neither the largest nor the smallest element of J. Let f0 : ΛJ
j → D be any map; we wish to show that
there exists a map f : ∆J → D which extends f0. We ﬁrst observe that the induced projection ΛJ
j → ∆1
extends uniquely to ∆J (since ∆1 is isomorphic to the nerve of a category). Let J = J−
J+ be the induced
decomposition of J. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that j ∈ J−. In this case, we may identify
f0 with a map

j ⊆ ∆J− is right anodyne.

j ⊆ K × ∆J−

The ∞-category D has just two objects, which we will denote by x and y. We observe that M =
HomR
D(x, y) and N = HomL
D(x, y). Proposition 1.2.2.3 implies that M and N are Kan complexes. Proposi-
tions 2.2.2.7 and 2.2.4.1 imply each these Kan complexes is weakly homotopy equivalent to MapC[D](x, y),
so that M and N are homotopy equivalent to one another as desired.

Remark 4.1.1.6. In the situation of Lemma 4.1.1.5, the homotopy equivalence between M and N is
furnished by the composition of a chain of weak homotopy equivalences

which is functorial in the triple (C, p : K → C, q : K ′ → C).

M ← |M |Q• → HomC[D](x, y) ← |N |Q• → N,

Proposition 4.1.1.7. Let v : K ′ → K be a coﬁnal map and p : K → C a diagram in an ∞-category C. Then
the map φ : Cp/ → Cpv/ is an equivalence of left ﬁbrations over C: in other words, it induces a homotopy
equivalence of Kan complexes after passing to the ﬁber over every object x of C.

Proof. We wish to prove that the map

Cp/ ×C{x} → Cpv/ ×C{x}

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes. Lemma 4.1.1.5 implies that the left hand side is homotopy
equivalent MapC(K, C/x). Similarly, the right hand side can be identiﬁed with MapC(K ′, C/x). Using the
functoriality implicit in the proof of Lemma 4.1.1.5 (see Remark 4.1.1.6), it suﬃces to show that the restriction
map

MapC(K, C/x) → MapC(K ′, C/x)

is a homotopy equivalence. Since v is coﬁnal, this follows immediately from the fact that the projection
C/x → C is a right ﬁbration.

Proposition 4.1.1.8. Let v : K ′ → K be a map of (small) simplicial sets. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The map v is coﬁnal.

(2) Given any ∞-category C and any diagram p : K → C, the induced map Cp/ → Cp′/ is an equivalence

of ∞-categories, where p′ = p ◦ v.

(3) For every ∞-category C and every diagram p : K ⊲ → C which is a colimit of p = p|K, the induced map

p′ : K ′⊲ → C is a colimit of p′ = p′|K ′.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. Let p : K → C be as in (2). Proposition 4.1.1.7 implies that the
induced map Cp/ → Cp′/ induces a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes, after passing to the ﬁber over
any object of C. Since both Cp/ and Cp′/ are left-ﬁbered over C, Corollary 2.4.4.4 implies that Cp/ → Cp′/ is
a categorical equivalence. This proves that (1) ⇒ (2).

188

Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed, and let p : K ⊲ → C be as in (3). Then we may identify p with an
initial object of the ∞-category Cp/. The induced map Cp/ → Cp′/ is an equivalence, and therefore carries
the initial object p to an initial object p′ of Cp′/; thus p′ is a colimit of p′. This proves that (2) ⇒ (3).

It remains to prove that (3) ⇒ (1). For this, we make use of the theory of classifying right ﬁbrations
(§3.3.2). Let X → K be a right ﬁbration. We wish to show that composition with v induces a homotopy
equivalence MapK(K, X) → MapK(K ′, X).
It will suﬃce to prove this result after replacing X by any
equivalent right ﬁbration. Let S denote the ∞-category of spaces. According to Corollary 3.3.2.8, there is a
classifying map p : K → Sop and an equivalence of right ﬁbrations between X and (S∗/)op ×Sop K, where ∗
denotes a ﬁnal object of S.

The ∞-category S admits small limits (Corollary 4.2.4.8). It follows that there exists a map p : K ⊲ → Sop
which is a colimit of p = p|K. Let x denote the image in S of the cone point of K ⊲. Let p′ : K ′⊲ → Sop be
the induced map. Then, by hypothesis, p′ is a colimit of p′ = p′|K ′. According to Lemma 4.1.1.5, there is a
(natural) chain of weak homotopy equivalences relating MapK(K, X) with (Sop)p/ ×Sop {y}. Similarly, there
is a chain of weak homotopy equivalences connecting MapK(K ′, X) with (Sop)p′/ ×Sop {y}. Consequently,
we are reduced to proving that the left vertical map in the diagram

(Sop)p/ ×Sop {y}

(Sop)p/ ×Sop {y}

(Sop)x/ ×Sop {y}

(Sop)p′/ ×Sop {y}

(Sop)p′/ ×Sop {y}

/ (Sop)x/ ×Sop {y}

is a homotopy equivalence. Since p and q are colimits of p and q, the left horizontal maps are trivial ﬁbrations.
Since the inclusions of the cone points into K ⊲ and K ′⊲ are right anodyne, the right horizontal maps are
also trivial ﬁbrations. It therefore suﬃces to prove that the right vertical map is a homotopy equivalence.
But this map is an isomorphism of simplicial sets.

Corollary 4.1.1.9. Let p : K → K ′ be a map of simplicial sets, and q : K ′ → K ′′ a categorical equivalence.
Then p is coﬁnal if and only if q ◦ p is coﬁnal. In particular, (taking p = idS′) q itself is coﬁnal.

Proof. Let C be an ∞-category, r′′ : K ′′ → C a diagram, and set r′ = r′′ ◦ q, r = r′ ◦ p. Since q is a categorical
equivalence, Cr′′/ → Cr′/ is a categorical equivalence. It follows that Cr/ → Cr′′/ is a categorical equivalence
if and only if Cr/ → Cr′/ is a categorical equivalence. We now apply the characterization (2) of Proposition
4.1.1.8.

Corollary 4.1.1.10. The property of coﬁnality is homotopy invariant. In other words, if two maps f, g :
K → K ′ have the same image in the homotopy category of Set∆ obtained by inverting all categorical equiv-
alences, then f is coﬁnal if and only if g is coﬁnal.

Proof. Choose a categorical equivalence K ′ → C, where C is an ∞-category. In view of Corollary 4.1.1.9, we
may replace K ′ by C and thereby assume that K ′ is itself an ∞-category. Since f and g are homotopic, there
exists a cylinder object S equipped with a trivial ﬁbration p : S → K, a map q : S → C, and two sections
s, s′ : K → S of p, such that f = q ◦ s, g = q ◦ s′. Since p is a categorical equivalence, so is every section of
p. Consequently, s and s′ are coﬁnal. We now apply Proposition 4.1.1.3 to deduce that f is coﬁnal if and
only if q is coﬁnal. Similarly, g is coﬁnal if and only if q is coﬁnal.

Corollary 4.1.1.11. Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets. The following are equivalent:

(1) The map p is a coﬁnal right ﬁbration.

(2) The map p is a trivial ﬁbration.

Proof. Clearly any trivial ﬁbration is a right ﬁbration. Furthermore, any trivial ﬁbration is a categorical
equivalence, hence coﬁnal by Corollary 4.1.1.9. Thus (2) implies (1). Conversely, suppose that p is a coﬁnal
right ﬁbration. Since p is coﬁnal, the natural map MapS(S, X) → MapS(X, X) is a homotopy equivalence of

Kan complexes. In particular, there exists a section f : S → X of p such that f ◦ p is (ﬁberwise) homotopic
to the identity map of X. Consequently, for each vertex s of S, the ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s} is a contractible
Kan complex (since the identity map Xs → Xs is homotopic to the constant map with value f (s)). The
dual of Lemma 2.1.3.4 now shows that p is a trivial ﬁbration.

Corollary 4.1.1.12. A map X → Z of simplicial sets is coﬁnal if and only if it admits a factorization

where X → Y is right-anodyne and Y → Z is a trivial ﬁbration.

X

f
→ Y

g
→ Z,

Proof. The “if” direction is clear: if such a factorization exists, then f is coﬁnal (since it is right anodyne),
g is coﬁnal (since it is a categorical equivalence), and consequently g ◦ f is coﬁnal (since it is a composition
of coﬁnal maps).

For the “only if” direction, let us suppose that X → Z is a coﬁnal map. By the small object argument

(Proposition A.1.2.5), there is a factorization

X

f
→ Y

g
→ Z

where f is right-anodyne and g is a right ﬁbration. The map g is coﬁnal by Proposition 4.1.1.3, and therefore
a trivial ﬁbration by Corollary 4.1.1.11.

Corollary 4.1.1.13. Let p : S → S′ be a coﬁnal map, and K any simplicial set. Then the induced map
K × S → K × S′ is coﬁnal.

Proof. Using Corollary 4.1.1.12, we may suppose that p is either right anodyne or a trivial ﬁbration. Then
the induced map K × S → K × S′ has the same property.

4.1.2 Smoothness and Right Anodyne Maps

In this section, we explain how to characterize the classes of right anodyne and coﬁnal morphisms in terms
of the contravariant model structures studied in §2.1.4. We also introduce a third class of maps between
simplicial sets, which we call smooth.

We begin with the following characterization of right anodyne maps:

Proposition 4.1.2.1. Let i : A → B be a map of simplicial sets. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map i is right anodyne.

(2) For any map of simplicial sets j : B → C, the map i is a trivial coﬁbration with respect to the

contravariant model structure on (Set∆)/C .

(3) The map i is a trivial coﬁbration with respect to the contravariant model structure on (Set∆)/B.

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) follows immediately from Proposition 2.1.4.9, and the implication (2) ⇒ (3)
is obvious. Suppose that (3) holds. To prove (1), it suﬃces to show that given any diagram

such that p is a right ﬁbration, one can supply the dotted arrow f as indicated. Replacing p : X → Y by
the pullback X ×Y B → B, we may reduce to the case where Y = B. Corollary 2.2.3.12 implies that X is
a ﬁbrant object of (Set∆)/B (with respect to contravariant model structure) so that the desired map f can
be found.

and j is a coﬁbration, then j is right-anodyne.

j

Proof. By Proposition 4.1.2.1, i and j ◦ i are contravariant equivalences in (Set∆)/C . It follows that j is a

f f ′′ is right anodyne by Proposition 4.1.2.1 again.

`

Proof. Let f : A → B be a ﬁltered colimit of right anodyne morphisms fα : Aα → Bα. According to
Proposition 4.1.2.1, each fα is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/B. Since contravariant equivalences are
stable under ﬁltered colimits, we conclude that f is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/B so that f is right
anodyne by Proposition 4.1.2.1.

Proposition 4.1.2.1 has an analogue for coﬁnal maps:

Proposition 4.1.2.5. Let i : A → B be a map of simplicial sets. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map i coﬁnal.

(2) For any map j : B → C, the inclusion i is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/C .

(3) The map i is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/B.

Proof. Suppose (1) is satisﬁed. By Corollary 4.1.1.12, i admits a factorization as a right anodyne map
followed by a trivial ﬁbration. Invoking Proposition 4.1.2.1, we conclude that (2) holds. The implication
(2) ⇒ (3) is obvious. If (3) holds, then we can choose a factorization

A i′

→ A′ i′′

→ B

of i, where i′ is right anodyne and i′′ is a right ﬁbration. Then i′′ is a contravariant ﬁbration (in Set∆/B)
and a contravariant weak equivalence, and is therefore a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. We now apply
Corollary 4.1.1.12 to conclude that i is coﬁnal.

Corollary 4.1.2.6. Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets, where S is a Kan complex. Then p is coﬁnal
if and only if it is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Proof. By Proposition 4.1.2.5, p is coﬁnal if and only if it is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/S. If S is
a Kan complex, then Proposition 3.1.5.7 asserts that the contravariant equivalences are precisely the weak
homotopy equivalences.

Let p : X → Y be an arbitrary map of simplicial sets. In §2.1.4 we showed that p induces a Quillen
adjunction (p!, p∗) between the contravariant model categories (Set∆)/X and (Set∆)/Y . The functor p∗ itself
has a right adjoint, which we will denote by p∗; it is given by

p∗(M ) = MapY (X, M ).

The adjoint functors (p∗, p∗) are not Quillen adjoints in general. Instead we have:

Proposition 4.1.2.7. Let p : X → Y be a map of simplicial sets. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) For any right-anodyne map i : A → B in (Set∆)/Y , the induced map A ×Y X → B ×Y X is right-

anodyne.

(2) For every Cartesian diagram

Proof. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed; let us prove (2). Since property (1) is clearly stable under base change,
we may suppose that p′ = p. Let u : M → N be a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/Y . If M and N are
ﬁbrant, then u is a homotopy equivalence, so that p∗(u) : p∗M → p∗N is also a homotopy equivalence. In
the general case, we may select a diagram

where M ′ and N ′ are ﬁbrant, and the maps i and j are right anodyne (and therefore i′ is also right anodyne).
Then p∗(v) is a contravariant equivalence, while the maps p∗(i), p∗(j), and p∗(i′) are all right anodyne; by
It follows that p∗(u) is a contravariant
Proposition 4.1.2.1 they are contravariant equivalences as well.
equivalence.

To prove (3), it suﬃces to show that p′∗ preserves coﬁbrations and trivial coﬁbrations. The ﬁrst statement
is obvious, and the second follows immediately from (2). Conversely the existence of a Quillen adjunction
(p′∗, p∗) implies that p′∗ preserves contravariant equivalences between coﬁbrant objects. Since every object
of (Set∆)/Y ′ is coﬁbrant, we deduce that (3) implies (2).

Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed, and let i : A → B be a right-anodyne map in (Set∆)/Y as in (1). Then
i is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/B. Let p′ : X ×Y B → B be base change of p; then (2) implies that
the induced map i′ : p′∗A → p′∗B is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/B×Y X . By Proposition 4.1.2.1,
the map i′ is right anodyne. Now we simply note that i′ may be identiﬁed with the map A ×Y X → B ×Y X
in the statement of (1).

Deﬁnition 4.1.2.8. We will say that a map p : X → Y of simplicial sets is smooth if it satisﬁes the
(equivalent) conditions of Proposition 4.1.2.7.

Remark 4.1.2.9. Let

X ′

be a pullback diagram of simplicial sets. Suppose that p is smooth and that f is coﬁnal. Then f ′ is
coﬁnal: this follows immediately from characterization (2) of Proposition 4.1.2.7 and characterization (3) of
Proposition 4.1.2.5.

We next give an alternative characterization of smoothness. Let

q′

be a Cartesian diagram of simplicial sets. Then we obtain an isomorphism Rp′∗Rq∗ ≃ Rq′∗Rp∗ of right-
derived functors, which induces a natural transformation

ψp,q : Lq′

!Rp′∗ → Rp∗Lq!.

Proposition 4.1.2.10. Let p : X → Y be a map of simplicial sets. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map p is smooth.

(2) For every Cartesian rectangle

q′

q

/ Y,

the natural transformation ψp′,q is an isomorphism of functors from the homotopy category of (Set∆)/Y ′′
to the homotopy category of (Set∆)/X ′ (here all categories are endowed with the contravariant model
structure).

Proof. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed, and consider any Cartesian rectangle as in (2). Since p is smooth, p′ and
p′′ are also smooth. It follows that p′∗ and p′′∗ preserve weak equivalences, so they may be identiﬁed with
their right derived functors. Similarly, q! and q′
! preserve weak equivalences, so they may be identiﬁed with
their left derived functors. Consequently, the natural transformation ψp′,q is simply obtained by passage to
the homotopy category from the natural transformation

!p′′∗ → p′∗q!.
q′

But this is an isomorphism of functors before passage to the homotopy categories.

Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Let q : Y ′′ → Y ′ be a right-anodyne map in (Set∆)/Y , and form the
!Rp′′∗ and Rp′∗Lq! on the object
Cartesian square as in (2). Let us compute the value of the functors Lq′
!Rp′′∗ is easy: because Y ′′ is ﬁbrant and X ′′ = p′′∗Y ′′ is coﬁbrant, the
Y ′′ of (Set∆)/Y ′′ . The composite Lq′
result is X ′′, regarded as an object of (Set∆)/X ′ . The other composition is slightly trickier: Y ′′ is coﬁbrant,
but q!Y ′′ is not ﬁbrant when viewed as an object of (Set∆)/Y ′ . However, in view of the assumption that q

Rp′∗Lq! with the object p′∗Y ′ = X ′ of (Set∆)/X ′ . Condition (2) now implies that the natural map X ′′ → X ′
is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/X ′ . Invoking Proposition 4.1.2.1, we deduce that q′ is right anodyne,
as desired.

Remark 4.1.2.11. The terminology “smooth” is suggested by the analogy of Proposition 4.1.2.10 with the
smooth base change theorem in the theory of ´etale cohomology (see, for example, [28]).

Proposition 4.1.2.12. Suppose given a commutative diagram

X X ′′ → S is smooth.

Proof. This follows immediately from Corollary 4.1.2.3 and characterization (1) of Proposition 4.1.2.7.

`

Proposition 4.1.2.13. The collection of smooth maps p : X → S is stable under ﬁltered colimits in (Set∆)/S.

Proof. Combine Corollary 4.1.2.4 with characterization (1) of Proposition 4.1.2.7.

Proposition 4.1.2.14. Let p : X → S be a coCartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Then p is smooth.

Proof. Let i : B′ → B be a right anodyne map in (Set∆)/S; we wish to show that the induced map
B′ ×S X → B ×S X is right anodyne. By general nonsense, we may reduce ourselves to the case where i is
i ⊆ ∆n where 0 < i ≤ n. Making a base change, we may suppose that S = B. By Proposition
an inclusion Λn
3.2.2.7, there exists a composable sequence of maps

and a quasi-equivalence M op(φ) → X. Consider the diagram

The left vertical map is right-anodyne, since it is a pushout of the inclusion A0 × Λn
i ⊆ A0 × ∆n. It follows
that f is coﬁnal, being a composition of a right-anodyne map and a categorical equivalence. Since g is
coﬁnal (being a categorical equivalence) we deduce from Proposition 4.1.1.3 that h is coﬁnal. Since h is a
monomorphism of simplicial sets, it is right-anodyne by Proposition 4.1.1.3.

Proposition 4.1.2.15. Let p : X → S × T be a biﬁbration. Then the composite map πS ◦ p : X → S is
smooth.

Proof. For every map T ′ → T , let XT ′ = X ×T T ′. We note that X is a ﬁltered colimit of XT ′ , as T ′ ranges
over the ﬁnite simplicial subsets of T . Using Proposition 4.1.2.13, we can reduce to the case where T is ﬁnite.
Working by induction on the dimension and the number of nondegenerate simplices of T , we may suppose
∂ ∆n ∆n, where the result is known for T ′ and for ∂ ∆n. Applying Proposition 4.1.2.12, we
that T = T ′
can reduce to the case T = ∆n. We now apply Lemma 2.4.7.5 to deduce that p is a coCartesian ﬁbration,
and therefore smooth by Proposition 4.1.2.14.

Lemma 4.1.2.16. Let C be an ∞-category containing an object C, and let f : X → Y be a covariant
equivalence in (Set∆)/ C. The induced map

is also a covariant equivalence in C/C .

X ×C C/C → Y ×C C/C

Proof. It will suﬃce to prove that for every object Z → C of (Set∆)/ C, the ﬁber product Z ×C C/C is a
homotopy product of Z with C/C in (Set∆)/ C (with respect to the covariant model structure). Choose a
factorization

Z i→ Z ′ j

→ C,

where i is left anodyne and j is a left ﬁbration. According to Corollary 2.2.3.12, we may regard Z ′ as a
ﬁbrant replacement for Z in (Set∆)/ C. It therefore suﬃces to prove that the map i′ : Z ×C C/C → Z ′ ×C C/C
is a covariant equivalence. According to Proposition 4.1.2.5, it will suﬃce to prove that i′ is left anodyne.
The map i′ is a base change of i by the projection p : C/C → C; it therefore suﬃces to prove that pop is
smooth. This follows from Proposition 4.1.2.14, since p is a right ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

Lemma 4.1.2.16 implies that the bottom horizontal map is a covariant equivalence. The vertical maps are
both pullbacks of the right anodyne inclusion {C} ⊆ C/C along smooth maps, and are therefore right anodyne.
In particular, the vertical arrows and the bottom horizontal arrow are all weak homotopy equivalences; it
follows that the map XC → YC is a weak homotopy equivalence as well.

4.1.3 Quillen’s Theorem A for ∞-Categories

Suppose that f : C → D is a functor between ∞-categories, and that we wish to determine whether or not
f is coﬁnal. According to Proposition 4.1.1.8, the coﬁnality of f is equivalent to the assertion that for any
diagram p : D → E, f induces an equivalence

One can always deﬁne a morphism

(p ◦ f ) → lim
−→

(p)

(provided that both sides are deﬁned); the question is whether or not we can deﬁne an inverse ψ = φ−1.
(p ◦ f ), indexed by
Roughly speaking, this involves deﬁning a compatible family of maps ψD : p(D) → lim
−→
D ∈ D. The only reasonable candidate for ψD is a composition

p(D) → (p ◦ f )(C) → lim
−→

(p ◦ f ),

where the ﬁrst map arises from a morphism D → f (C) in C. Of course, the existence of C is not automatic.
Moreover, even if C exists, it may is usually not unique. The collection of candidates for C is parametrized
by the ∞-category CD/ = C ×D DD/. In order to make the above construction work, we need the ∞-category
CD/ to be weakly contractible. More precisely, we will prove the following result:

Theorem 4.1.3.1 (Joyal [44]). Let f : C → D be a map of simplicial sets, where D is an ∞-category. The
following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The functor f is coﬁnal.

(2) For every object D ∈ D, the simplicial set C ×D DD/ is weakly contractible.

We ﬁrst need to establish the following lemma:

Lemma 4.1.3.2. Let p : U → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Suppose that for every vertex s
of S, the ﬁber Xs = p−1{s} is weakly contractible. Then p is coﬁnal.

Proof. Let q : N → S be a right ﬁbration. For every map of simplicial sets T → S, let XT = MapS(T, N )
and YT = MapS(T ×S U, N ). Our goal is to prove that the natural map XS → YS is a homotopy equivalence
of Kan complexes. We will prove, more generally, that for any map T → S, the map φT : YT → ZT is a
homotopy equivalence. The proof goes by induction on the (possibly inﬁnite) dimension of T . Choose a
β<α T (β)
transﬁnite sequence of simplicial subsets T (α) ⊆ T , where each T (α) is obtained from T (< α) =
by adjoining a single nondegenerate simplex of T (if such a simplex exists). We prove that φT (α) is a
homotopy equivalence by induction on α. Assuming that φT (β) is a homotopy equivalence for every β < α,
we deduce that φT (<α) is the homotopy inverse limit of a tower of equivalences, and therefore a homotopy
∂ ∆n ∆n. Then
equivalence. If T (α) = T (< α), we are done. Otherwise, we may write T (α) = T (< α)
φT (α) can be written as a homotopy pullback of φT (<α) with φ∆n over φ∂ ∆n . The third map is a homotopy
equivalence by the inductive hypothesis. Thus, it suﬃces to prove that φ∆n is an equivalence. In other
words, we may reduce to the case T = ∆n.

`

S

By Proposition 3.2.2.7, there exists a composable sequence of maps

θ : A0 ← . . . ← An

196

and a quasi-equivalence f : M (θ) → X ×S T , where M (θ) denotes the mapping simplex of the sequence θ.
Given a map T ′ → T , we let ZT ′ = MapS(M (θ) ×T T ′, N ). Proposition 3.3.1.7 implies that q is a categorical
ﬁbration. It follows that, for any map T ′ → T , the categorical equivalence M (θ) ×T T ′ → U ×S T ′ induces
another categorical equivalence ψT ′ = YT ′ → ZT ′ . Since YT ′ and ZT ′ are Kan complexes, the map ψT ′
is a homotopy equivalence. Consequently, to prove that φT is an equivalence, it suﬃces to show that the
composite map

XT → YT → ZT

is an equivalence.

Consider the composition

u : X∆n−1

u′
→ Z∆n−1

→ MapS(∆n−1 × An, N ) u′′′
u′′

→ MapS({n − 1} × An, N )

Using the fact that q is a right ﬁbration and that An is weakly contractible, we deduce that u and u′′′ are
homotopy equivalences. The inductive hypothesis implies that u′ is a homotopy equivalence. Consequently,
u′′ is also a homotopy equivalence. The space ZT ﬁts into a homotopy Cartesian diagram

ZT

v′′

Z∆n−1

u′′

MapS(∆n × An, N )

/ MapS(∆n−1 × An, N ).

It follows that v′′ is a homotopy equivalence. Now consider the composition

v : X∆n

v′
→ Z∆n

→ MapS(∆n × An, N ) v′′′
v′′

→ MapS({n} × An, N ).

Again, because q is a right ﬁbration and An is weakly contractible, the maps v and v′′′ are homotopy
equivalences. Since v′′ is a homotopy equivalence, we deduce that v′ is a homotopy equivalence, as desired.

Proof of Theorem 4.1.3.1. Using the small object argument, we can factor f as a composition

C f ′

→ C′ f ′′

→ D

where f ′ is a categorical equivalence and f ′′ is an inner ﬁbration. Then f ′′ is coﬁnal if and only if f is coﬁnal
(Corollary 4.1.1.10). For every D ∈ D, the map DD/ → D is a left ﬁbration, so the induced map CD/ → C′
D/
is a categorical equivalence (Proposition 3.3.1.3). Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that (1) ⇔ (2) for
the morphism f ′′ : C′ → D. In other words, we may assume that the simplicial set C is an ∞-category.

Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed, and choose D ∈ D. The projection DD/ → D is a left ﬁbration,
and therefore smooth (Proposition 4.1.2.14). Applying Remark 4.1.2.9, we deduce that the projection
C ×D DD/ → DD/ is coﬁnal, and therefore a weak homotopy equivalence (Proposition 4.1.1.3). Since DD/
has an initial object, it is weakly contractible. Therefore C ×D DD/ is weakly contractible, as desired.

We now prove that (2) ⇒ (1). Let M = Fun(∆1, D) ×Fun({1},D) C. Then the map f factors as a

composition

→ M f ′′
where f ′ is the obvious map and f ′′ is given by evaluation at the vertex {0} ⊆ ∆1. Note that there is
a natural projection map π : M → C, that f ′ is a section of π, and that there is a simplicial homotopy
h : ∆1 × M → M from idM to f ′ ◦ π which is compatible with the projection to C. It follows from Proposition
2.1.2.11 that f ′ is right anodyne.

C f ′

→ D

Corollary 2.4.7.12 implies that f ′′ is a Cartesian ﬁbration. The ﬁber of f ′′ over an object D ∈ D is
isomorphic to C ×D DD/, which is equivalent to C ×D DD/ and therefore weakly contractible (Proposition
4.2.1.5). By assumption, the ﬁbers of f ′′ are weakly contractible. Lemma 4.1.3.2 asserts that f ′′ is coﬁnal.
It follows that f , as a composition of coﬁnal maps, is also coﬁnal.

Using Theorem 4.1.3.1 we can easily deduce the following classical result of Quillen:

Corollary 4.1.3.3 (Quillen’s Theorem A). Let f : C → D be a functor between ordinary categories. Suppose
that, for every object D ∈ D, the ﬁber product category C ×D DD/ has weakly contractible nerve. Then f
induces a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets N(C) → N(D).

Proof. The assumption implies that N(f ) : N(C) → N(D) satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 4.1.3.1. It
follows that N(f ) is a coﬁnal map of simplicial sets, and therefore a weak homotopy equivalence (Proposition
4.1.1.3).

4.2 Techniques for Computing Colimits

In this section, we will introduce various techniques for computing, analyzing, and manipulating colimits.
We begin in §4.2.1 by introducing a variant on the join construction of §1.2. The new join construction is
(categorically) equivalent to the version we are already familiar with, but has better formal behavior in some
contexts. For example, they permit us to deﬁne a parametrized version of overcategories and undercategories,
which we will analyze in §4.2.2.

In §4.2.3, we address the following question: given a diagram p : K → C and a decomposition of K into
(p) related to the colimits of those pieces? For example, if K = A ∪ B, then

“pieces”, how is the colimit lim
−→
it seems reasonable expect an equation of the form

lim
−→

(p) = (lim
−→

p|A)

(lim
−→

p|B).

alim−→(p|A∩B)

Of course there are many variations on this theme; we will lay out a general framework in §4.2.3, and apply
it to speciﬁc situations in §4.4.

Although the ∞-categorical theory of colimits is elegant and powerful, it can be be diﬃcult to work
with because the colimit lim
(p) of a diagram p is only well-deﬁned up to equivalence. This problem can
−→
sometimes be remedied by working in the more rigid theory of model categories, where the notion of ∞-
categorical colimit should be replaced by the notion of homotopy colimit (see §A.3.3).
In order to pass
smoothly between these two settings, we need to know that the ∞-categorical theory of colimits agrees with
the more classical theory of homotopy colimits. A precise statement of this result (Theorem 4.2.4.1) will be
formulated and proven in §4.2.4.

4.2.1 Alternative Join and Slice Constructions

In §1.2.8, we introduced the join functor ⋆ on simplicial sets.
In [44], Joyal introduces a closely related
operation ⋄ on simplicial sets. This operation is equivalent to ⋆ (Proposition 4.2.1.2) but is more technically
convenient in certain contexts. In this section we will review the deﬁnition of the operation ⋄ and to establish
some of its basic properties (see also [44] for a discussion).

Deﬁnition 4.2.1.1 ([44]). Let X and Y be simplicial sets. The simplicial set X ⋄ Y is deﬁned to be pushout

X

(X × Y × ∆1)

Y.

aX×Y ×{0}

aX×Y ×{1}

We note that since X × Y × (∂ ∆1) → X × Y × ∆1 is a monomorphism, the pushout diagram deﬁning
X ⋄ Y is a homotopy pushout in Set∆ (with respect to the Joyal model structure). Consequently, we deduce
that categorical equivalences X → X ′, Y → Y ′ induce a categorical equivalence X ⋄ Y → X ′ ⋄ Y ′.

The simplicial set X ⋄ Y admits a map p : X ⋄ Y → ∆1, with X ≃ p−1{0} and Y ≃ p−1{1}. Consequently,
there is a unique map X ⋄ Y → X ⋆ Y which is compatible with the projection to ∆1 and induces the identity
maps on X and Y .

Proposition 4.2.1.2. For any simplicial sets X and Y , the natural map φ : X ⋄ Y → X ⋆ Y is a categorical
equivalence.

Proof. Since both sides are compatible with the formation of ﬁltered colimits in X, we may suppose that X
contains only ﬁnitely many nondegenerate simplices. If X is empty, then φ is an isomorphism and the result
is obvious. Working by induction on the dimension of X and the number of nondegenerate simplices in X,
we may write

X = X ′

∆n,

a∂ ∆n

199

and we may assume that the statement is known for the pairs (X ′, Y ) and (∂ ∆n, Y ). Since the Joyal model
structure on Set∆ is left-proper, we have a map of homotopy pushouts

(X ′ ⋄ Y )

(∆n ⋄ Y ) → (X ′ ⋆ Y )

(∆n ⋆ Y ),

and we are therefore reduced to proving the assertion in the case where X = ∆n. The inclusion

a∂ ∆n⋄Y

a∂ ∆n⋆Y

∆{0,1}

. . .

∆{n−1,n} ⊆ ∆n

a{n−1}
is inner anodyne. Thus, if n > 1, we can conclude by induction. Thus we may suppose that X = ∆0 or
X = ∆1. By a similar argument, we may reduce to the case where Y = ∆0 or Y = ∆1. The desired result
now follows from an explicit calculation.

a{1}

Corollary 4.2.1.3. Let S → T and S′ → T ′ be categorical equivalences of simplicial sets. Then the induced
map

S ⋆ S′ → T ⋆ T ′

is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 4.2.1.2, since the operation ⋄ has the desired property.

Corollary 4.2.1.4. Let X and Y be simplicial sets. Then the natural map

is an equivalence of simplicial categories.

C[X ⋆ Y ] → C[X] ⋆ C[Y ]

Proof. Using Corollary 4.2.1.3, we may reduce to the case where X and Y are ∞-categories. We note
that C[X ⋆ Y ] is a correspondence from C[X] to C[Y ]. To complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that
MapC[X⋆Y ](x, y) is weakly contractible, for any pair of objects x ∈ X, y ∈ Y . Since X ⋆ Y is an ∞-category,
we can apply Theorem 1.1.5.13 to deduce that the mapping space MapC[X⋆Y ](x, y) is weakly homotopy
equivalent to HomR

X⋆Y (x, y), which consists of a single point.

For ﬁxed X, the functor

Y 7→ X ⋄ Y
Set∆ → (Set∆)X/
preserves all colimits. By the adjoint functor theorem (or by direct construction), this functor has a right
adjoint

(p : X → C) 7→ Cp/ .

Since the functor Y 7→ X ⋄ Y preserves coﬁbrations and categorical equivalences, we deduce that the passage
from C to Cp/ preserves categorical ﬁbrations and categorical equivalences between ∞-categories. Moreover,
Proposition 4.2.1.2 has the following consequence:

Proposition 4.2.1.5. Let C be an ∞-category, and let p : X → C be a diagram. Then the natural map

is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Cp/ → Cp/

According to Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4, a colimit for a diagram p : X → C is an initial object of the ∞-category
Cp/. In view of the above remarks, an object of Cp/ is a colimit for p if and only if its image in Cp/ is an
initial object; in other words, we can replace Cp/ by Cp/ (and ⋆ by ⋄) in Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4.

By Proposition 2.1.2.1, for any ∞-category C and any map p : X → C, the induced map Cp/ → C is a

left ﬁbration. We now show that Cp/ has the same property:

200

Proposition 4.2.1.6. Suppose given a diagram of simplicial sets

K0 ⊆ K

p
→ X

q
→ S

where q is a categorical ﬁbration. Let r = q ◦ p : K → S, p0 = p|K0, and r0 = r|K0. Then the induced map

is a left ﬁbration.

φ : X p/ → X p0/ ×Sr0/ Sr/

Proof. We must show that q has the right lifting property with respect to every left-anodyne inclusion
A0 ⊆ A. Unwinding the deﬁnition, this amounts to proving that q has the right lifting property with respect
to the inclusion

Since q is a categorical ﬁbration, it suﬃces to show that i is a categorical equivalence. The above pushout is
a homotopy pushout, so it will suﬃce to prove the analogous statement for the weakly equivalent inclusion

i : (A0 ⋄ K)

(A ⋄ K0) ⊆ A ⋄ K.

aA0⋄K0

(A0 ⋆ K)

(A ⋆ K0) ⊆ A ⋆ K.

aA0⋆K0

But this map is inner anodyne (Lemma 2.1.2.3).

Corollary 4.2.1.7. Let C be an ∞-category, and let p : K → C be any diagram. For every vertex v of C,
the map Cp/ ×C{v} → Cp/ ×C{v} is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes.

Proof. The map Cp/ → Cp/ is a categorical equivalence of left ﬁbrations over C; now apply Proposition
3.3.1.5.

Corollary 4.2.1.8. Let C be an ∞-category containing vertices x and y. The maps

HomR

C (x, y) → HomC(x, y) ← HomL

C(x, y)

are homotopy equivalences of Kan complexes (see §1.2.2 for an explanation of this notation).

Proof. Apply Corollary 4.2.1.7 (the dual of Corollary 4.2.1.7) to the case where p is the inclusion {x} ⊆ C
(the inclusion {y} ⊆ C).

Remark 4.2.1.9. The above ideas dualize in an evident way; given a map of simplicial sets p : K → X, we
can deﬁne a simplicial set X /p with the universal mapping property

HomSet∆(K ′, X /p) = Hom(Set∆)K/ (K ′ ⋄ K, X).

4.2.2 Parametrized Colimits

Let p : K → C be a diagram in an ∞-category C. The goal of this section is to make precise the idea that the
(p) exists). We will prove this in a very general
colimit lim
−→
context, in which not only the diagram p but also the simplicial set K is allowed to vary. We begin by
introducing a relative version of the ⋄-operation.

(p) depends functorially on p (provided that lim

We observe that the operation ⋄S is compatible with base change in the following sense: for any map

T → S of simplicial sets and any objects X, Y ∈ (Set∆)/S, there is a natural isomorphism

(XT ⋄T YT ) ≃ (X ⋄S Y )T ,

where we let ZT denote the ﬁber product Z ×S T . We also note that in the case where S is a point, the
operation ⋄S coincides with the operation ⋄ introduced in §4.2.1.

Fix K ∈ (Set∆)/S. We note that functor (Set∆)/S → ((Set∆)/S)K/ deﬁned by

where pT denotes the induced map KT → YT . In particular, the ﬁber of Y pS / over a vertex s of S can be
identiﬁed with the absolute slice construction Y ps/

Remark 4.2.2.2. Our notation is somewhat abusive: the simplicial set Y pS / depends not only on the map
pS : K → Y , but also on the simplicial set S. We will attempt to avoid confusion by always indicating the
simplicial set S by a subscript in the notation for the map in question; we will only omit this subscript in
the case S = ∆0, in which case the functor described above coincides with the deﬁnition given in §4.2.1.

Proof. Invoking Proposition 3.1.2.1, we may replace q : Y → S by the induced map Y A → SA, and thereby
reduce to the case where A = ∆0. We now recall the notation introduced in the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6:
more speciﬁcally, the family {σi}0≤i≤n of nondegenerate simplices of ∆n × ∆1. Let B(0) = B, and more
generally set B(n) = B ∪ σn ∪ . . . ∪ σn+1−i so that we we have a ﬁltration

B(0) ⊆ . . . ⊆ B(n + 1) = ∆n × ∆1.

A map f0 : B(0) → Y has been prescribed for us already; we construct extensions fi : B(i) → Y by induction
on i. For i < n, there is a pushout diagram

Λn+1

Thus, the extension fi+1 can be found in virtue of the assumption that q is an inner ﬁbration. For i = n,
we obtain instead a pushout diagram

and the desired extension can be found in virtue of the assumption that f0 carries the edge ∆{n−1,n} × {1}

to show that the inclusion

Remark 4.2.2.6. The hypothesis on s in Proposition 4.2.2.4 can be weakened: all we need in the proof is
existence of maps M op(φ) → K ×S ∆n which are universal categorical equivalences (that is, induce categorical
equivalences M op(φ) ×∆n T → K ×S T for any T → ∆n). Consequently, Proposition 4.2.2.4 remains valid
when K ≃ S ×K 0, for any simplicial set K 0 (not necessarily an ∞-category). It seems likely that Proposition
4.2.2.4 remains valid whenever s is a smooth map of simplicial sets, but we have not been able to prove this.

We can now express the idea that the colimit a diagram should depend functorially on the diagram (at

least for “smoothly parametrized” families of diagrams):

Proposition 4.2.2.7. Let q : Y → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration, let pS : K → Y be a diagram. Suppose that:

(1) For each vertex s of S, the restricted diagram ps : Ks → Ys has a colimit in the ∞-category Ys.

(2) The composition q ◦ pS is a coCartesian ﬁbration.

4.2.3 Decomposition of Diagrams

Let C be an ∞-category, and p : K → C a diagram indexed by a simplicial set K. In this section, we will try
to analyze the colimit lim
(p|KI )}, where {KI} is some family
−→
of simplicial subsets of K. In fact, it will be useful to work in slightly more generality: we will allow each
KI to be an arbitrary simplicial set mapping to K (not necessarily via a monomorphism).

(p) (if it exists) in terms of the colimits {lim
−→

Throughout this section, we will ﬁx a simplicial set K, an ordinary category I, and a functor F : I →
(Set∆)/K. It may be helpful to imagine that I is a partially ordered set and that F is an order-preserving map
from I to the collection of simplicial subsets of K; this will suﬃce for many but not all of our applications.
We will denote F (I) by KI, and the tautological map KI → K by πI .

Our goal is to show that, under appropriate hypotheses, we can recover the colimit of a diagram p : K → C
in terms of the colimits of diagrams p ◦ πI : KI → C. Our ﬁrst goal is to show that the construction of these
colimits is suitably functorial in I. For this, we need an auxiliary construction.

Notation 4.2.3.1. We deﬁne a simplicial set KF as follows. A map ∆n → KF is determined by the
following data:

(i) A map ∆n → ∆1, corresponding to a decomposition [n] = {0, . . . , i} ∪ {i + 1, . . . , n}.

(ii) A map e− : ∆{0,...,i} → K.

(iii) A map e+ : ∆{i+1,...,n} → N(I), which we may view as a chain of composable morphisms

in the category I.

(iv) For each j ∈ {i + 1, . . . , n}, a map ej which ﬁts into a commutative diagram

I(i + 1) → . . . → I(n)

Moreover, for j ≤ k we require that ek is given by the composition

∆{0,...,i} ej→ KI(j) → KI(k).

Remark 4.2.3.2. In the case where i < n, the maps e− and {ej}j>i are completely determined by ei+1,
which can be arbitrary.

The simplicial set KF is equipped with a map KF → ∆1. Under this map, the preimage of the vertex {0}
is K ⊆ KF , and the preimage of the vertex {1} is N(I) ⊆ KF . For I ∈ I, we will denote the corresponding
vertex of N(I) ⊆ KF by XI . We note that, for each I ∈ I, there is a commutative diagram

KI

I

πI

π′
I

K(cid:127)

/ KF

where π′

I carries the cone point of K ⊲

I to the vertex XI of KF .

Let us now suppose that p : K → C is a diagram in an ∞-category C. Our next goal is to prove
Proposition 4.2.3.4, which will allow us to extend p to a larger diagram KF → C which carries each vertex
XI to a colimit of p ◦ πI : KI → C. First, we need a lemma.

Lemma 4.2.3.3. Let C be an ∞-category, and let σ : ∆n → C be a simplex having the property that σ(0) is
an initial object of C. Let ∂ σ = σ| ∂ ∆n. The natural map Cσ/ → C∂ σ/ is a trivial ﬁbration.

Proof. Unwinding the deﬁnition, we are reduced to solving the extension problem depicted in the diagram

(∂ ∆n ⋆ ∆m)

C

∆n ⋆ ∆m.

We can identify the domain of f0 with ∂ ∆n+m+1. Our hypothesis guarantees that f0(0) is an initial object
of C, which in turn guarantees the existence of f .

Proposition 4.2.3.4. Let p : K → C be a diagram in an ∞-category C, let I be an ordinary category, and
let F : I → (Set∆)/K be a functor. Suppose that, for each I ∈ I, the induced diagram pI = p ◦ πI : KI → C
has a colimit qI : K ⊲

I → C.

There exists a map q : KF → C such that q ◦ π′

I = qI and q|K = p. Furthermore, for any such q, the

induced map Cq/ → Cp/ is a trivial ﬁbration.

Proof. For each X ⊆ N(I), we let KX denote the simplicial subset of KF consisting of all simplices σ ∈ KF
such that σ ∩ N(I) ⊆ X. We note that K∅ = K and that KN(I) = KF .

Deﬁne a transﬁnite sequence Yα of simplicial subsets of N(I) as follows. Let Y0 = ∅, and let Yλ =

γ<λ Yγ
when λ is a limit ordinal. Finally, let Yα+1 be obtained from Yα by adjoining a single nondegenerate simplex,
provided that such a simplex exists. We note that for α suﬃciently large, such a simplex will not exist and
we set Yβ = Yα for all β > α.

S

We deﬁne a sequence of maps qβ : KYβ → C so that the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) We have q0 = p : K∅ = K → C.

(2) If α < β, then qα = qβ|KYα.

(3) If {XI} ⊆ Yα, then qα ◦ π′

I = qI : K ⊲

I → C.

Provided that such a sequence can be constructed, we may conclude the proof by setting q = qα for α
suﬃciently large.

The construction of qα goes by induction on α. If α = 0, then qα is determined by condition (1); if α is a
(nonzero) limit ordinal, then qα is determined by condition (2). Suppose that qα has been constructed; we
give a construction of qα+1.

There are two cases to consider. Suppose ﬁrst that Yα+1 is obtained from Yα by adjoining a vertex XI .

In this case, qα+1 is uniquely determined by conditions (2) and (3).

Now suppose that Xα+1 is obtained from Xα by adjoining a nondegenerate simplex σ of positive dimen-

sion, corresponding to a sequence of composable maps

in the category I. We note that the inclusion KYα ⊆ KYα+1 is a pushout of the inclusion

I0 → . . . → In

KI0 ⋆ ∂ σ ⊆ KI0 ⋆ σ.

Consequently, constructing the map qα+1 is tantamount to ﬁnding an extension of a certain map s0 : ∂ σ →
CpI / to the whole of the simplex σ. By assumption, s0 carries the initial vertex of σ to an initial object
of CpI /, so that the desired extension s can be found. For use below, we record a further property of our
construction: the projection Cqα+1/ → Cqα/ is a pullback of the map (CpI /)s/ → (CpI /)s0/, which is a trivial
ﬁbration.

We now wish to prove that for any extension q with the above properties, the induced map Cq/ → Cp/ is a
trivial ﬁbration. We ﬁrst observe that the map q can be obtained by the inductive construction given above:
namely, we take qα to be the restriction of q to KYα. It will therefore suﬃce to show that, for every pair of
ordinals α ≤ β, the induced map Cqβ / → Cqα/ is a trivial ﬁbration. The proof of this goes by induction on
β: the case β = 0 is clear, and if β is a limit ordinal we observe that the inverse limit of transﬁnite tower of
trivial ﬁbrations is itself a trivial ﬁbration. We may therefore suppose that β = γ + 1 is a successor ordinal.
Using the factorization

Cqβ / → Cqγ / → Cqα/

and the inductive hypothesis, we are reduced to proving this in the case where β is the successor of α, which
was treated above.

Let us now suppose that we are given diagrams p : K → C, F : I → (Set∆)/K as in the statement of
Proposition 4.2.3.4, and let q : KF → C be a map which satisﬁes the conclusions of the Proposition. Since
Cq/ → Cp/ is a trivial ﬁbration, we may identify colimits of the diagram q with colimits of the diagram p (up
to equivalence). Of course, this is not useful in itself, since the diagram q is more complicated than p. Our
objective now is to show that, under the appropriate hypotheses, we may identify the colimits of q with the
colimits of q| N(I). First, we need a few lemmas.

Lemma 4.2.3.5 (Joyal [44]). Let f : A0 ⊆ A and g : B0 ⊆ B be inclusions of simplicial sets, and suppose
that g is a weak homotopy equivalence. Then the induced map

is right anodyne.

h : (A0 ⋆ B)

(A ⋆ B0) ⊆ A ⋆ B

aA0⋆B0

Proof. Our proof follows the pattern of Lemma 2.1.2.3. The collection of all maps f which satisfy the
conclusion (for any choice of g) forms a weakly saturated class of morphisms. It will therefore suﬃce to
prove that the h is right anodyne when f is the inclusion ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∂ ∆n. Similarly, the collection of all maps
g which satisfy the conclusion (for ﬁxed f ) forms a weakly saturated class. We may therefore reduce to
the case where g is a horn inclusion Λm
i ⊆ ∆m. In this case, we may identify h with the horn inclusion
Λm+n+1

i+n+1 ⊆ ∆m+n+1, which is clearly right-anodyne.

Lemma 4.2.3.6. Let A0 ⊆ A be an inclusion of simplicial sets, and let B be weakly contractible. Then the
inclusion A0 ⋆ B ⊆ A ⋆ B is right anodyne.

208

Proof. As above, we may suppose that the inclusion A0 ⊆ A is identiﬁed with ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n. If K is a point,
then the inclusion A0 × B ⊆ A × B is isomorphic to Λn+1

n+1 ⊆ ∆n+1, which is clearly right-anodyne.

In the general case, B is nonempty, so we may choose a vertex b of B. Since B is weakly contractible,
the inclusion {b} ⊆ B is a weak homotopy equivalence. We have already shown that A0 ⋆ {b} ⊆ A ⋆ {b} is
right anodyne. It follows that the pushout inclusion

is right anodyne. To complete the proof, we apply Lemma 4.2.3.5 to deduce that the inclusion

A0 ⋆ B ⊆ (A ⋆ {b})

(A0 ⋆ B)

aA0⋆{b}

(A ⋆ {b})

(A0 ⋆ B) ⊆ A ⋆ B

aA0⋆{b}

is right anodyne.

Notation 4.2.3.7. Let σ ∈ Kn be a simplex of K. We deﬁne a category Iσ as follows. The objects of
Iz are pairs (I, σ′), where I ∈ I, σ′ ∈ (KI )n, and πI (σ′) = σ. A morphism from (I ′, σ′) to (I ′′, σ′′) in Iσ
consists of a morphism α : I ′ → I ′′ in I with the property that F (α)(σ′) = σ′′. We let I′
σ ⊆ Iσ denote
the full subcategory consisting of pairs (I, σ′) where σ′ is a degenerate simplex in KI. Note that if σ is
nondegenerate, I′

σ is empty.

Proposition 4.2.3.8. Let K be a simplicial set, I an ordinary category, and F : I → (Set∆)/K a functor.
Suppose further that:

(1) For each nondegenerate simplex σ of K, the category Iσ is acyclic (that is, the simplicial set N(Iσ) is

weakly contractible).

(2) For each degenerate simplex σ of K, the inclusion N(I′

σ) ⊆ N(Iσ) is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Then the inclusion N(I) ⊆ KF is right anodyne.

Proof. Consider any family of subsets {Ln ⊆ Kn} which is stable under the “face maps” di on K (but not
necessarily the degeneracy maps si, so that the family {Ln} does not necessarily have the structure of a
simplicial set). We deﬁne a simplicial subset LF ⊆ KF as follows: a nondegenerate simplex ∆n → KF
belongs to LF if and only if the corresponding (possibly degenerate) simplex ∆{0,...,i} → K belongs to
Li ⊆ Ki (see Notation 4.2.3.1).

We note that if L = ∅, then LF = N(I). If L = K, then LF = KF (so that our notation is unambiguous).
Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that for any L ⊆ L′, the inclusion LF ⊆ L′
F is right-anodyne. By
general nonsense, we may reduce to the case where L′ is obtained from L by adding a single simplex σ ∈ Kn.
We now have two cases to consider. Suppose ﬁrst that the simplex σ is nondegenerate. In this case, it is
F is a pushout of ∂ σ ⋆ N(Iσ) ⊆ σ ⋆ N(Iσ). By hypothesis, N Iz

not diﬃcult to see that the inclusion LF ⊆ L′
is weakly contractible, so that the inclusion LF ⊆ L′

F is right anodyne by Lemma 4.2.3.6.

In the case where σ is degenerate, we observe that LF ⊆ L′

F is a pushout of the inclusion

(∂ σ ⋆ N(Iσ))

(σ ⋆ N(I′

σ)) ⊆ σ ⋆ N(Iσ),

a∂ σ⋆N(I′
σ )

which is right anodyne by Lemma 4.2.3.5.

Remark 4.2.3.9. Suppose that I is a partially ordered set, and that F is an order-preserving map from I
to the collection of simplicial subsets of K. In this case, we observe that I′
σ = Iσ whenever σ is a degenerate
simplex of K, and that Iσ = {I ∈ I : σ ∈ KI} for any σ. Consequently, the conditions of Proposition
4.2.3.8 hold if and only if each of the partially ordered subsets Iσ ⊆ I has a contractible nerve. This holds
automatically if I is directed and K =

I∈I KI .

209

Corollary 4.2.3.10. Let K be a simplicial set, I a category, and F : I → (Set∆)/K a functor which satisﬁes
the hypotheses of Proposition 4.2.3.8. Let C be an ∞-category, p : K → C any diagram, and let q : KF → C
be an extension of p which satisﬁed the conclusions of Proposition 4.2.3.4. The natural maps

Cp/ ← Cq/ → Cq| N(I)/

are trivial ﬁbrations. In particular, we may identify colimits of p with colimits of q| N(I).

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 4.2.3.8, since the right anodyne inclusion N I ⊆ KF is
coﬁnal and therefore induces a trivial ﬁbration Cq/ → Cq| N(I)/ by Proposition 4.1.1.8.

We now illustrate the usefulness of Corollary 4.2.3.10 by giving a sample application. First, a bit of
terminology. If κ and τ are regular cardinals, we will write τ ≪ κ if, for any cardinals τ0 < τ , κ0 < κ,
we have κτ0
0 < κ (we refer the reader to Deﬁnition 5.4.2.8 and the surrounding discussion for more details
concerning this condition).

Corollary 4.2.3.11. Let C be an ∞-category and τ ≪ κ regular cardinals. Then C admits κ-small colimits
if and only if C admits τ -small colimits and colimits indexed by (the nerves of ) κ-small, τ -ﬁltered partially
ordered sets.

Proof. The “only if” direction is obvious. Conversely, let p : K → C be any κ-small diagram. Let I denote
the partially ordered set of τ -small simplicial subsets of K. Then I is directed and
I∈I KI = K, so that
the hypotheses of Proposition 4.2.3.8 are satisﬁed. Since each pI = p ◦ πI has a colimit in C, there exists
a map q : KF → C satisfying the Proposition 4.2.3.4. Since Cq/ → Cp/ is an equivalence of ∞-categories,
p has a colimit if and only if q has a colimit. By Corollary 4.2.3.10, q has a colimit if and only if q| N(I)
has a colimit. It is clear that I is a τ -ﬁltered partially ordered set. Furthermore, it is κ-small provided that
τ ≪ κ.

S

Similarly, we have:

Corollary 4.2.3.12. Let f : C → C′ be a functor between ∞-categories, and let τ ≪ κ be regular cardinals.
Suppose that C admits κ-small colimits. Then f preserves κ-small colimits if and only if it preserves τ -small
colimits, and all colimits indexed by (the nerves of ) κ-small, τ -ﬁltered partially ordered sets.

We will conclude this section with another application of Proposition 4.2.3.8, in which I is not a partially
ordered set, and the maps πI : KI → K are not (necessarily) injective. Instead, we take I to be the category
of simplices of K. In other words, an object of I ∈ I consists of a map σI : ∆n → K, and a morphism from
I to I ′ is given by a commutative diagram

}{{{{{{{{

For each I ∈ I, we let KI denote the domain ∆n of σI , and we let πI = σI : KI → K.

Lemma 4.2.3.13. Let K be a simplicial set, and let I denote the category of simplices of K (as deﬁned
above). Then there is a retraction r : KF → K which ﬁxes K ⊆ KF .

Proof. Given a map e : ∆n → KF , we will describe the composite map r ◦ e : ∆n → K. The map e classiﬁes
the following data:

(i) A decomposition [n] = {0, . . . , i} ∪ {i + 1, . . . , n}.

(ii) A map e− : ∆i → K.

∆mi+1 → . . . → ∆mn → K.

(iv) A compatible family of maps {ej : ∆i → ∆mj }j>i, having the property that each composition ∆i ej→

∆mj → K coincide with e−.

If i = n, we set r ◦ e = e−. Otherwise, we let r ◦ e denote the composition

∆n f

→ ∆mn → K

where f : ∆n → ∆mn is deﬁned as follows:

• The restriction f |∆i coincides with en.

• For i < j ≤ n, we let f (j) denote the image in ∆mn of the ﬁnal vertex of ∆mj .

Proposition 4.2.3.14. For every simplicial set K, there exists a category I and a coﬁnal map f : N(I) → K.

Proof. We take I to be the category of simplices of K, as deﬁned above, and f to the composition of the
inclusion N(I) ⊆ KF with the retraction r of Lemma 4.2.3.13. To prove that f is coﬁnal, it suﬃces to show
that the inclusion N(I) ⊆ KF is right anodyne, and that the retraction r is coﬁnal.

To show that N(I) ⊆ KF is right anodyne, it suﬃces to show that the hypotheses of Proposition 4.2.3.8
are satisﬁed. Let σ : ∆J → K be a simplex of K. We observe that the category Iσ may be described as
follows: its objects consist of pairs of maps (s : ∆J → ∆M , t : ∆M → K) with t ◦ s = σ. A morphism from
(s, t) to (s′, t′) consists of a map

α : ∆M → ∆M ′
with s′ = α ◦ s, t = t′ ◦ α. In particular, we note that Iσ has an initial object (id∆J , σ). It also has a ﬁnal
object: namely, a pair (s, t) such that s is surjective and t : ∆M → K is nondegenerate. It follows that
N(Iσ) is weakly contractible for any simplex σ of K. Moreover, if z is degenerate, then any ﬁnal object of
Iσ belongs to I′
σ) is weakly contractible when
σ is degenerate, so that the inclusion N(I′
σ) ⊆ N(Iσ) is a weak homotopy equivalence. This completes the
veriﬁcation of the hypotheses of Proposition 4.2.3.8.

σ (and is therefore a ﬁnal object of I′

σ). We conclude that N(I′

We now show that r is coﬁnal. According to Proposition 4.1.1.8, it suﬃces to show that for any ∞-
category C and any map p : K → C, the induced map Cq/ → Cp/ is a categorical equivalence, where q = p ◦ r.
This follows from Proposition 4.2.3.4.

Variant 4.2.3.15. Let K be a simplicial set, and let I be the category of simplices of K as above. Let I′ be
the full subcategory of I spanned by the nondegenerate simplices of K. The inclusion I′ ⊆ I has a left adjoint
L. It follows immediately from Theorem 4.1.3.1 that the inclusion N(I′) ⊆ N(I) is coﬁnal. Consequently,
we obtain also a coﬁnal map f : N(I′) → K. The simplicial set N(I′) can be identiﬁed with the barycentric
subdivision of K. The assertion that f is coﬁnal can be regarded as a generalization of the classical fact that
barycentric subdivision does not change the weak homotopy type of a simplicial set.

Note the category of nondegenerate simplices of N(I′) can be identiﬁed with a partially ordered set.
The nerve of this partially ordered set can be identiﬁed with the second barycentric subdivision K (2) of K.
Applying the above argument twice, we conclude that there is a coﬁnal map K (2) → K. Consequently, we
obtain the following reﬁnement of Proposition 4.2.3.14: for every simplicial set K, there exists a partially
ordered set A and a coﬁnal map N(A) → K.

4.2.4 Homotopy Colimits

Our goal in this section is to compare the ∞-categorical theory of colimits with the more classical theory of
homotopy colimits in simplicial categories (see Remark A.3.3.13). Our main result is the following:

Theorem 4.2.4.1. Let C and I be ﬁbrant simplicial categories and F : I → C a simplicial functor. Suppose
given an object C ∈ C and a compatible family of maps {ηI : F (I) → C}I∈I. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The maps ηI exhibit C as a homotopy colimit of the diagram F .

(2) Let f : N(I) → N(C) be the simplicial nerve of F , and f : N(I)⊲ → N(C) the extension of f determined

by the maps {ηI }. Then f is a colimit diagram in N(C).

Remark 4.2.4.2. For an analogous result (in a slightly diﬀerent setting), we refer the reader to [39].

The proof of Theorem 4.2.4.1 will occupy the remainder of this section. We begin with a convenient

criterion for detecting colimits in ∞-categories:

Lemma 4.2.4.3. Let C be an ∞-category, K a simplicial set, and p : K ⊲ → C a diagram. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(i) The diagram p is a colimit of p = p|K.

(ii) Let X ∈ C denote the image under p of the cone point of K ⊲, let δ : C → Fun(K, C) denote the diagonal
embedding, and let α : p → δ(X) denote the natural transformation determined by p. Then, for every
object Y ∈ C, composition with α induces a homotopy equivalence

φY : MapC(X, Y ) → MapFun(K,C)(p, δ(Y )).

Proof. Using Corollary 4.2.1.8, we can identify the mapping space MapFun(K,C)(p, δ(Y )) with the ﬁber
Cp/ ×C{Y }, for each object Y ∈ C. Under this identiﬁcation, the map φY can be identiﬁed with the
ﬁber over Y of the composition

→ Cp/ φ′′
where φ′ is a section to the trivial ﬁbration Cp/ → CX/. The map φ′′ is a left ﬁbration (Proposition 4.2.1.6).
Condition (i) is equivalent to the requirement that φ′′ be a trivial Kan ﬁbration, and condition (ii) is
equivalent to the requirement that each of the maps

CX/ φ′

→ Cp/,

Y : Cp/ ×C{Y } → Cp/ ×C{Y }.
φ′′

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan compexes (which, in view of Lemma 2.1.3.3, is equivalent to the requirement
that φ′′
Y be a trivial Kan ﬁbration). The equivalence of these two conditions now follows from Lemma
2.1.3.4.

The key to Theorem 4.2.4.1 is the following result, which compares the construction of diagram categories

in the ∞-categorical and simplicial settings:

Proposition 4.2.4.4. Let S be a small simplicial set, C a small simplicial category, and u : C[S] → C an
equivalence. Suppose that A is a combinatorial simplicial model category, and let U be a C-chunk of A (see
Deﬁnition A.3.4.9). Then the induced map

is a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets.

N(UC)◦ → Fun(S, N(U◦))

212

Remark 4.2.4.5. In the statement of Proposition 4.2.4.4, it makes no diﬀerence whether we regard AC as
endowed with the projective or injective model structure.

Remark 4.2.4.6. An analogous result was proved by Hirschowitz and Simpson; see [39].

Proof. Choose a regular cardinal κ such that S and C are κ-small. Using Lemma A.3.4.15, we can write U
as a κ-ﬁltered colimit of small C-chunks U′ contained in U. Since the collection of categorical equivalences is
stable under ﬁltered colimits, it will suﬃce to prove the result after replacing U by each U′; in other words,
we may suppose that U is small.

According to Theorem 2.2.5.1, we may identify the homotopy category of Set∆ (with respect to the
Joyal model structure) with the homotopy category of Cat∆. We now observe that, because N(U◦) is an ∞-
category, the simplicial set Fun(S, N(U◦)) can be identiﬁed with an exponential [N(U◦)][S] in the homotopy
category hSet∆. We now conclude by applying Corollary A.3.4.14.

One consequence of Proposition 4.2.4.4 is that every homotopy coherent diagram in a suitable model

category A can be “straightened”, as we indicated in Remark 1.2.6.2.

Corollary 4.2.4.7. Let I be a ﬁbrant simplicial category, S a simplicial set, and p : N(I) → S a map. Then
it is possible to ﬁnd the following:

(1) A ﬁbrant simplicial category C.

(2) A simplicial functor P : I → C.

(3) A categorical equivalence of simplicial sets j : S → N(C).

(4) An equivalence between j ◦ p and N(P ), as objects of the ∞-category Fun(N(I), N(C)).

Proof. Choose an equivalence i : C[S] → C0, where C0 is ﬁbrant; let A denote the model category of simplicial
presheaves on C0 (endowed with the injective model structure). Composing i with the Yoneda embedding of
C0, we obtain a fully faithful simplicial functor C[S] → A◦, which we may alternatively view as a morphism
j0 : S → N(A◦).

We now apply Proposition 4.2.4.4 to the case where u is the counit map C[N(I)] → I. We deduce that

the natural map

N(AI)◦ → Fun(N(I), N(A◦))

is an equivalence. From the essential surjectivity, we deduce that j0 ◦ p is equivalent to N(P0), where
P0 : I → A◦ is a simplicial functor.

We now take C to be the essential image of C[S] in A◦, and note that j0 and P0 factor uniquely through

maps j : S → N(C), P : I → C which possess the desired properties.

We now return to our main result.

Proof of Theorem 4.2.4.1: Let A denote the category SetC
∆, endowed with the projective model structure.
Let j : Cop → A denote the Yoneda embedding, and let U denote the full subcategory of A spanned by
those objects which are weakly equivalent to j(C) for some C ∈ C, so that j induces an equivalence of
simplicial categories Cop → U◦. Choose a trivial injective coﬁbration j ◦ F → F ′, where F ′ is a injectively
ﬁbrant object of AIop
. Let f ′ : N(I)op → N(U◦) be the nerve of F ′, and let C′ = j(C), so that the maps
{ηI : F (I) → C}I∈I induce a natural transformation α : δ(C′) → f ′, where δ : N(U◦) → Fun(N(I)op, N(U◦))
denotes the diagonal embedding. In view of Lemma 4.2.4.3, condition (1) admits the following reformulation:

(1′) For every object A ∈ U◦, composition with α induces a homotopy equivalence

MapN(U◦)(A, C′) → MapFun(N(I)op,N(U◦))(δ(A), f ′).

Using Proposition 4.2.4.4, we can reformulate this condition again:

213

(1′′) For every object A ∈ U◦, the canonical map

is a homotopy equivalence, where δ′ : A → AIop

denotes the diagonal embedding.

MapA(A, C′) → MapAIop (δ′(A), F ′)

Let B ∈ A be a limit of the diagram F ′, so we have a canonical map β : C′ → B between ﬁbrant objects
of A. Condition (2) is equivalent to the assertion that β is a weak equivalence in A, while condition (1′′) is
equivalent to the assertion that composition with β induces a homotopy equivalence

MapA(A, C′) → MapA(A, B)

for each A ∈ U◦. The implication (2) ⇒ (1′′) is clear. Conversely, suppose that (1′′) is satisﬁed. For each
X ∈ C, the object j(X) belongs to U◦, so that β induces a homotopy equivalence

C′(X) ≃ MapA(j(X), C′) → MapA(j(X), B) ≃ B(X).

It follows that β is a weak equivalence in A as desired.

Corollary 4.2.4.8. Let A be a combinatorial simplicial model category. The associated ∞-category S =
N(A◦) admits (small) limits and colimits.

Proof. We give the argument for colimits; the case of limits follows by a dual argument. Let p : K → S
be a (small) diagram in S. By Proposition 4.2.3.14, there exists a (small) category I and a coﬁnal map
q : N(I) → K. Since q is coﬁnal, p has a colimit in S if and only if p ◦ q has a colimit in S; thus we may
reduce to the case where K = N(I).

Using Proposition 4.2.4.4, we may suppose that p is the nerve of a injectively ﬁbrant diagram p′ : I → A◦.
Let p′ : I ⋆{x} → AI be a limit of p′, so that p′ is a homotopy limit diagram in A. Now choose a trivial
ﬁbration p′′ → p′ in AI, where p′′ is coﬁbrant. The simplicial nerve of p′′ determines a colimit diagram
f : N(I)⊲ → S, by Theorem 4.2.4.1. We now observe that f = f | N(I) is equivalent to p, so that p also
admits a colimit in S.

214

4.3 Kan Extensions

Let C and I be ordinary categories. There is an obvious “diagonal” functor δ : C → CI, which carries an
object C ∈ C to the constant diagram I → C taking the value C. If C admits small colimits, then the functor
δ has a left adjoint CI → C. This left adjoint admits an explicit description: it carries an arbitrary diagram
f : I → C to the colimit lim
(f ). Consequently, we can think of the theory of colimits as the study of left
−→
adjoints to diagonal functors.

More generally, if one is given a functor i : I → I′ between diagram categories, then composition with i
→ CI. Assuming that C has a suﬃcient supply of colimits, one can construct a left

induces a functor i∗ : CI′
adjoint to i∗. We then refer to this left adjoint as left Kan extension along i.

In this section, we will study the ∞-categorical analogue of the theory of left Kan extensions. In the
extreme case where I′ is the one-object category ∗, this theory simply reduces to the theory of colimits
introduced in §1.2.13. Our primary interest will be at the opposite extreme, when i is a fully faithful
embedding; this is the subject of §4.3.2. We will treat the general case in §4.3.3.

With a view toward later applications, we will treat not only the theory of absolute left Kan extensions,
but also a relative notion which works over a base simplicial set S. The most basic example is the case of a
relative colimit which we study in §4.3.1.

4.3.1 Relative Colimits

In §1.2.13, we introduced the notions of limit and colimit for a diagram p : K → C in an ∞-category C. For
many applications, it is convenient to have a relative version of these notions, which makes reference not to
an ∞-category C but to an arbitrary inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

Deﬁnition 4.3.1.1. Let f : C → D be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets, let p : K ⊲ → C be diagram, and
let p = p|K. We will say that p is an f -colimit of p if the map

Cp/ → Cp/ ×Df p/

Df p/

is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. In this case, we will also say that p is an f -colimit diagram.

Remark 4.3.1.2. Let f : C → D and p : K ⊲ → C be as in Deﬁnition 4.3.1.1. Then p is an f -colimit of
p = p|K if and only if the map

φ : Cp/ → Cp/ ×Df p/

Df p/

is a categorical equivalence. The “only if” direction is clear. The converse follows from Proposition 2.1.2.1
(which implies that φ is a left ﬁbration), Proposition 3.3.1.7 (which implies that φ is a categorical ﬁbration),
and the fact that a categorical ﬁbration which is a categorical equivalence is a trivial Kan ﬁbration.

Observe that Proposition 2.1.2.1 also implies that the map

Df p/ is a homotopy
is a left ﬁbration. Using Propositions 3.3.1.3 and 3.3.1.7, we conclude that Cp/ ×Df p/
ﬁber product of Cp/ with Df p/ over Df p/ (with respect to the Joyal model structure on Set∆). Consequently,
we deduce that p is an f -colimit diagram if and only if the diagram of simplicial sets

Df p/ → Df p/

is homotopy Cartesian.

Example 4.3.1.3. Let C be an ∞-category and f : C → ∗ the projection of C to a point. Then a diagram
p : K ⊲ → C is an f -colimit if and only if it is a colimit in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4.
Example 4.3.1.4. Let f : C → D be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and let e : ∆1 = (∆0)⊲ → C be an
edge of C. Then e is an f -colimit if and only if it is f -coCartesian.

The following basic stability properties follow immediately from the deﬁnition:

Proposition 4.3.1.5.

(1) Let f : C → D be a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Then every diagram

p : K ⊲ → C is an f -colimit.

(2) Let f : C → D and g : D → E be inner ﬁbrations of simplicial sets, and let p : K ⊲ → C be a diagram.

Suppose that f ◦ p is a g-colimit. Then p is an f -colimit if and only if p is a g ◦ f -colimit.

(3) Let f : C → D be an inner ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let p, q : K ⊲ → C be diagrams which are
equivalent when viewed as objects of the ∞-category Fun(K ⊲, C). Then p is an f -colimit if and only if
q is an f -colimit.

since ψ and ψ′ are coCartesian ﬁbrations.

The next pair of results can be regarded as a generalization of Proposition 4.1.1.8. They assert that,

when computing relative colimits, we are free to replace any diagram by a coﬁnal subdiagram.

Proposition 4.3.1.7. Let p : C → D be an inner ﬁbration of ∞-categories, let i : A → B be a coﬁnal map,
and let q : B⊲ → C be a diagram. Then q is a p-colimit if and only if q ◦ i⊲ is a p-colimit.

Proof. Recall (Remark 4.3.1.2) that q is a relative colimit diagram if and only if the diagram

Cq/

Cq/

Dq0/

/ Dq0/

is homotopy Cartesian with respect to the Joyal model structure. Since i and i⊲ are both coﬁnal, this is
equivalent to the assertion that the diagram

Cqi⊲/

Cqi/

Dq0i⊲/

/ Dq0i/

is homotopy Cartesian, which (by Remark 4.3.1.2) is equivalent to the assertion that q ◦i⊲ is a relative colimit
diagram.

Proposition 4.3.1.8. Let p : C → D be a coCartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, let i : A → B be a coﬁnal
map, and let

B

B⊲

q

q0

Proof. Let q0 = q0|B. We have a commutative diagram

f

Cqi/ ×Dpqi/

Dpq/

Cqi/

Dq0/

/ Dq0/

/ Dq0i/

where the horizontal maps are categorical equivalences (since i is coﬁnal, and by Proposition 3.3.1.3). Propo-
sition 2.4.3.2 implies that the vertical maps are coCartesian ﬁbrations, and that f preserves coCartesian
edges. Applying Proposition 3.3.1.5 to f , we deduce that the map φ : Cq/ ×Dq0/ {q0} → Cqi/ ×Dq0 i/ {q0i⊲}
is a categorical equivalence. Since φ is essentially surjective, we conclude that there exists an extension
q : B⊲ → C of q which covers q0, such that q ◦ i⊲ is a p-colimit diagram. We now apply Proposition 4.3.1.7
to conclude that q is itself a p-colimit diagram.

Let p : X → S be a coCartesian ﬁbration. The following results will allow us to reduce the theory of

p-colimits to the theory of ordinary colimits in the ﬁbers of p.

Proposition 4.3.1.9. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of ∞-categories, K a simplicial set, and
h : ∆1 × K ⊲ → X a natural transformation from h0 = h|{0} × K ⊲ to h1 = h|{1} × K ⊲. Suppose that:

(1) For every vertex x of K ⊲, the restriction h|∆1 × {x} is a p-coCartesian edge of X.

(2) The composition

∆1 × {∞} ⊆ ∆1 × K ⊲ h→ X

p
→ S

is a degenerate edge of S, where ∞ denotes the cone point of K ⊲.

Then h0 is a p-colimit if and only if h1 is a p-colimit.

Proof. Let h = h|∆1 × K, h0 = h|{0} × K, and h1 = h|{1} × K. Consider the diagram

According to Remark 4.3.1.2, it will suﬃce to show that the left vertical map is a categorical equivalence
if and only if the right vertical map is a categorical equivalence. For this, it will suﬃce to show that
each of the horizontal arrows is a categorical equivalence. Because the inclusions {1} × K ⊆ ∆1 × K and
{1} × K ⊲ ⊆ ∆1 × K ⊲ are right anodyne, the horizontal maps on the right are trivial ﬁbrations. We are
therefore reduced to proving that φ and ψ are categorical equivalences.

Let f : x → y denote the edge of X obtained by restricting h to the cone point of K ⊲. The map φ ﬁts

into a commutative diagram

Xh/

φ

Xh0/

Xf /

/ Xx/.

Since the inclusion of the cone point into K ⊲ is right anodyne, the vertical arrows are trivial ﬁbrations.
Moreover, hypotheses (1) and (2) guarantee that f is an equivalence in X, so that the map Xf / → Xx/ is a
trivial ﬁbration. This proves that φ is a categorical equivalence.

The map ψ admits a factorization

Xh/ ×Sph/ Sph/

ψ′
→ Xh0/ ×Sph0/ Sph/

ψ′′
→ Xh0 ×Sph0/ Sph0/.

To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that ψ′ and ψ′′ are trivial ﬁbrations of simplicial sets. We ﬁrst
observe that ψ′ is a pullback of the map

Xh/ → Xh0/ ×Sph0/ Sph/,

which is a trivial ﬁbration (Proposition 3.1.1.12). The map ψ′′ is a pullback of the left ﬁbration ψ′′

Proposition 4.3.1.10. Let q : X → S be a locally coCartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, let s be an object
of S, and let p : K ⊲ → Xs be a diagram. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map p is a q-colimit diagram.

(2) For every morphism e : s → s′ in S, the associated functor e! : Xs → Xs′ has the property that e! ◦ p

is a colimit diagram in the ∞-category Xs′ .

Proof. Assertion (1) is equivalent to the statement that the map

θ : Xp/ → Xp/ ×Sqp/ Sqp/

is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Since θ is a left ﬁbration, it will suﬃce to show that the ﬁbers of θ
are contractible. Consider an arbitrary vertex of Sqp/, corresponding to a morphism t : K ⋆ ∆1 → S. Since
{0} ∆1 and t|K ⋆ {0} is constant, we may assume without
K ⋆ ∆1 is categorically equivalent to (K ⋆ {0})
loss of generality that t factors as a composition

`

K ⋆ ∆1 → ∆1 e→ S.

Here e : s → s′ is an edge of S. Pulling back by the map e, we can reduce to the problem of proving the
following analogue of (1) in the case where S = ∆1:

(1′) The projection h0 : Xp/ ×S {s′} → Xp/ ×S {s′} is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

Choose a coCartesian transformation α : K ⊲ × ∆1 → X from p to p′, which covers the projection

Consider the diagram

K ⊲ × ∆1 → ∆1 ≃ S.

Xα/ ×S {s′}

Xp′/ ×S {s′}

h0

h

h1

Xp/ ×S {s′}

Xα/ ×S {s′}

Xp′/ ×S {s′}.

Note that the vertical maps are left ﬁbrations (Proposition 2.1.2.1). Since the inclusion K ⊲ × {1} ⊆ K ⊲ × ∆1
is right anodyne, the upper right horizontal map is a trivial ﬁbration. Similarly, the lower right horizontal
map is a trivial ﬁbration. Since α is a coCartesian transformation, we deduce that the left horizontal maps
are also trivial ﬁbrations (Proposition 3.1.1.12). Condition (2) is equivalent to the assertion that h1 is a
trivial ﬁbration (for each edge e : s → s′ of the original simplicial set S). Since h1 is a left ﬁbration,
and therefore a categorical ﬁbration (Proposition 3.3.1.7), this is equivalent to the assertion that h1 is a
categorical equivalence. Chasing through the diagram, we deduce that (2) is equivalent to the assertion that
h0 is a categorical equivalence, which (by the same argument) is equivalent to the assertion that h0 is a
trivial ﬁbration.

Corollary 4.3.1.11. Let p : X → S be a coCartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let K be a simplicial
set. Suppose that:

(1) For each vertex s of S, the ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s} admits colimits for all diagrams indexed by K.

(2) For each edge f : s → s′, the associated functor Xs → Xs′ preserves colimits of K-indexed diagrams.

Then for every diagram

Proof. Consider the map K × ∆1 → K ⊲ which is the identity on K × {0} and carries K × {1} to the cone
point of K ⊲. Let F denote the composition

K × ∆1 → K ⊲ f

→ S,

and let Q : K × ∆1 → X be a coCartesian lifting of F to X, so that Q is a natural transformation from q to
a map q′ : K → Xs, where s is the image under f of the cone point of K ⊲. In view of assumption (1), there
exists a map q′ : K ⊲ → Xs which is a colimit of q′. Assumption (2) and Proposition 4.3.1.10 guarantee that
q′ is also a p-colimit diagram, when regarded as a map from K ⊲ to X.

We have a commutative diagram

(K × ∆1)

(Q,q′)

/ S.

The left vertical map is an inner ﬁbration, so there exists a morphism r as indicated, rendering the diagram
commutative. We now consider the map K ⊲ × ∆1 → (K × ∆1)⊲ which is the identity on K × ∆1 and carries
the other vertices of K ⊲ × ∆1 to the cone point of (K × ∆1)⊲. Let Q denote the composition

K ⊲ × ∆1 → (K × ∆1)⊲ r→ X,

and let q = Q|K ⊲ × {0}. Then Q can be regarded as a natural transformation q → q′ of diagrams K ⊲ → X.
Since q′ is a p-colimit diagram, Proposition 4.3.1.9 implies that q is a p-colimit diagram as well.

Proposition 4.3.1.12. Let p : X → S be a coCartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let q : K ⊲ → X be a
diagram. Assume that:

(1) The map q carries each edge of K to a p-coCartesian edge of K.

(2) The simplicial set K is weakly contractible.

Then q is a p-colimit diagram if and only if it carries every edge of K ⊲ to a p-coCartesian edge of X.

Proof. Let s denote the image under p ◦ q of the cone point of K ⊲. Consider the map K ⊲ × ∆1 → K ⊲ which
is the identity on K ⊲ × {0} and collapses K ⊲ × {1} to the cone point of K ⊲. Let h denote the composition

K ⊲ × ∆1 → K ⊲ q

→ X

p
→ S,

which we regard as a natural transformation from p ◦ q to the constant map with value s. Let H : q → q′
be a coCartesian transformation from q to a diagram q′ : K ⊲ → Xs. Using Proposition 2.4.1.7, we conclude
that q′ carries each edge of K to a p-coCartesian edge of X, which is therefore an equivalence in Xs.

Let us now suppose that q carries every edge of K ⊲ to a p-coCartesian edge of X. Arguing as above,
we conclude that q′ carries each edge of K ⊲ to an equivalence in Xs. Let e : s → s′ be an edge of S and
e! : Xs → Xs′ an associated functor. The composition

K ⊲ q′

→ Xs

e!→ Xs′

carries each edge of K ⊲ to an equivalence in Xs, and is therefore a colimit diagram in Xs′ (Corollary 4.4.4.10).
Proposition 4.3.1.10 implies that q′ is a p-colimit diagram, so that Proposition 4.3.1.9 implies that q is a
p-colimit diagram as well.

For the converse, let us suppose that q is a p-colimit diagram. Applying Proposition 4.3.1.9, we conclude
In particular, q′ is a colimit diagram in the ∞-category Xs. Applying

that q′ is a p-colimit diagram.

Corollary 4.4.4.10, we conclude that q′ carries each edge of K ⊲ to an equivalence in Xs. Now consider an
arbitrary edge f : x → y of K ⊲. If f belongs to K, then q(f ) is p-coCartesian by assumption. Otherwise,
we may suppose that y is the cone point of K. The map H gives rise to a diagram

in the ∞-category X ×S ∆1. Here q′(f ) and φ′ are equivalences in Xs, so that q(f ) and φ are equivalent as
morphisms ∆1 → X ×S ∆1. Since φ is p-coCartesian, we conclude that q(f ) is p-coCartesian, as desired.

Lemma 4.3.1.13. Let p : C → D be an inner ﬁbration of ∞-categories, let C ∈ C be an object, and let
D = p(C). Then C is a p-initial object of C if and only if (C, idD) is an initial object of C ×D DD/.

Proof. We have a commutative diagram

where the vertical arrows are left ﬁbrations, and therefore categorical ﬁbrations (Proposition 3.3.1.7). We
wish to show that φ is a trivial ﬁbration if and only if φ′ is a trivial ﬁbration. This is equivalent to proving
that φ is a categorical equivalence if and only if φ′ is a categorical equivalence. For this, it will suﬃce to
show that ψ is a categorical equivalence. But ψ is a pullback of the trivial ﬁbration DidD / → DD/, and
therefore itself a trivial ﬁbration.

r-Cartesian morphisms.

Let C ∈ C be an object, D = p(C), and E = q(C). Let CE = C ×E{E}, DE = D ×E{E}, and pE : CE →

DE the induced map. Suppose that C is a pE-initial object of CE. Then C is a p-initial object of C.

Proof. Our hypothesis, together with Lemma 4.3.1.13, implies that (C, idD) is an initial object of

CE ×DE (DE)D/ ≃ (C ×D DD/) ×EE/ {idE}.

We will prove that the map φ : C ×D DD/ → EE/ is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Since idE is an initial object of
EE/, Lemma 2.4.4.7 will allow us to conclude that (C, idD) is an initial object of C ×D DD/. We can then
conclude the proof by applying Lemma 4.3.1.13 once more.

It remains to prove that φ is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Let us say that a morphism of C ×D DD/ is special
if its image in C is q-Cartesian. Since φ is obviously an inner ﬁbration, it will suﬃce to prove the following
assertions:

(1) Given an object X of C ×D DD/ and a morphism f : Y → φ(X) in EE/, we can write f = φ(f ) where

f is a special morphism of C ×D DD/.

(2) Every special morphism in C ×D DD/ is φ-Cartesian.

To prove (1), we ﬁrst identify X with a pair consisting of an object C′′ ∈ C and a morphism D → p(C′′)

in D, and f with a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → E which we depict as a diagram:

Since q is a Cartesian ﬁbration, the morphism g can be written as q(g) for some morphism g : C′ → C′′ in
C. We now have a diagram

so that the above diagram can be completed to a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → D such that r(σ) = σ.

We now prove (2). Suppose n ≥ 2, and we have a commutative diagram

4.3.2 Kan Extensions along Inclusions

In this section, we introduce the theory of left Kan extensions. Let F : C → D be a functor between ∞-
categories, and let C0 be a full subcategory of C. Roughly speaking, the functor F is a left Kan extension
of its restriction F0 = F | C0 if the values of F are as “small” as possible, given the values of F0. In order to
make this precise, we need to introduce a bit of terminology.
Notation 4.3.2.1. Let C be an ∞-category, and let C0 be a full subcategory. If p : K → C is a diagram, we
let C0
/C denotes the full
subcategory of C/C spanned by the morphisms C′ → C where C′ ∈ C0.

This diagram does not commute, but the functors FC ◦ G and FC ′ ◦ G′ are equivalent in the ∞-category
D(C0
. Consequently, FC ◦G is a p-colimit diagram if and only if FC ′ ◦G′ is a p-colimit diagram (Proposition
4.3.1.5). Since g and g′ are coﬁnal, we conclude that FC is a p-colimit diagram if and only if FC ′ is a p-colimit
diagram (Proposition 4.3.1.7).

Lemma 4.3.2.6.

(1) Let C be an ∞-category, p : D → D′ an inner ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and F, F ′ :
C → D be two functors which are equivalent in DC. Let C0 be a full subcategory of C. Then F is a
p-left Kan extension of F | C0 if and only if F ′ is a p-left Kan extension of F ′| C0.

(2) Suppose given a commutative diagram of ∞-categories

be a commutative diagram of ∞-categories, where the left horizontal maps are inclusions of full subcate-
gories, the right horizontal maps are inner ﬁbrations, and the vertical maps are categorical equivalences.
Then F is a p-left Kan extension of F | C0 if and only if F ′ is a p′-left Kan extension of F ′|C′0

.

Proof. Assertion (1) follows immediately from Proposition 4.3.1.5. Let us prove (2). Choose an object C ∈ C,
and consider the diagram

We claim that the upper left horizontal map is a p-colimit diagram if and only if the bottom left horizontal
map is a p′-colimit diagram. In view of Proposition 4.3.1.6, it will suﬃce to show that each of the vertical
maps is an equivalence of ∞-categories. For the middle and right vertical maps, this holds by assumption.
To prove that the left vertical map is a categorical equivalence, we consider the diagram

The bottom horizontal map is a categorical equivalence by Proposition 1.2.9.3, and the vertical maps are
inclusions of full subcategories. It follows that the top horizontal map is fully faithful, and its essential image

G0 is essentially surjective, this is the whole of C′0
/G(C).

It follows that if F ′ is a p′-left Kan extension of F ′|C′0

, then F is a p-left Kan extension of F | C0.
Conversely, if F is a p-left Kan extension of F | C0, then F ′ is a p′-left Kan extension of F ′|C′0
at G(C), for
every object C ∈ C. Since G is essentially surjective, Lemma 4.3.2.5 implies that F ′ is a p′-left Kan extension
of F ′|C′0

at every object of C′. This completes the proof of (2).

as in Deﬁnition 4.3.2.2, where F is a left Kan extension of F0 relative to p. Then the induced map

is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. In particular, we may identify p-colimits of F with p-colimits of F0.

Proof. Using Lemma 4.3.2.6, we may reduce to the case where C is minimal. Let us call a simplicial subset
E ⊆ C complete if it has the following property: for any simplex σ : ∆n → C, if σ|∆{0,...,i} factors through
C0 and σ|∆{i+1,...,n} factors through E, then σ factors through E. Note that if E is complete, then C0 ⊆ E.
We next deﬁne a transﬁnite sequence of complete simplicial subsets of C

C0 ⊆ C1 ⊆ . . .

α<λ Cα. If Cα = C, then we set Cα+1 = C. Otherwise, choose
as follows: if λ is a limit ordinal, we let Cλ =
some simplex σ : ∆n → C which does not belong to Cα, where the dimension n of σ is chosen as small as
possible, and let Cα+1 be the smallest complete simplicial subset of C containing Cα and the simplex σ.

Let Fα = F | Cα. We will prove that for every β ≤ α the projection

φα,β : DFα/ → D′

pFα/ ×D′

pFβ /

DFβ /

is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Taking α ≫ β = 0, we have Cα = C and the proof will be complete.

Our proof proceeds by induction on α. If α = β, then φα,β is an isomorphism and there is nothing to
prove. If α > β is a limit ordinal, then the inductive hypothesis implies that φα,β is the inverse limit of a
transﬁnite tower of trivial ﬁbrations, and therefore a trivial ﬁbration. It therefore suﬃces to prove that if
φα,β is a trivial ﬁbration, then φα+1,β is a trivial ﬁbration. We observe that φα+1,β = φ′
α,β ◦ φα+1,α, where
φ′
α,β is a pullback of φα,β and therefore a trivial ﬁbration by the inductive hypothesis. Consequently, it will
suﬃce to prove that φα+1,α is a trivial ﬁbration. The result is obvious if Cα+1 = Cα, so we may assume
without loss of generality that Cα+1 is the smallest complete simplicial subset of C containing Cα together
with a simplex σ : ∆n → C, where σ does not belong to Cα. Since n is chosen to be minimal, we may suppose
that σ is nondegenerate, and that the boundary of σ already belongs to Cα.

By construction there is an induced map C′ → C, which is easily shown to be a monomorphism of simplicial
sets; we may therefore identify E′ with its image in C. Since C is minimal, we can apply Proposition 2.3.3.9
to deduce that C′ is complete, so that C′ = Cα+1. Let G denote the composition

/C is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and therefore coﬁnal. Since F is a p-left

Kan extension of F0 at C, we conclude that σ′(0) is a q-initial object of E.

To prove that ψ is a trivial ﬁbration, it will suﬃce to prove that ψ has the right lifting property with
respect to the inclusion ∂ ∆m ⊆ ∆m, for each m ≥ 0. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, this amounts to the
existence of a dotted arrow as indicated in the diagram

Then F is a p-left Kan extension of F | C1 if and only if F is a p-left Kan extension of F | C0.

Proof. Let C be an object of C; we will show that F is a p-left Kan extension of F | C0 at C if and only if F

a∂ ∆m×∂ ∆n

where each Y (i + 1) is obtained from Y (i) by adjoining a single nondegenerate simplex whose boundary

Lemma 4.3.2.12. Consider a diagram of ∞-categories

with the property that the functor F : C → D, determined by evaluating f0 at the vertex {0} ⊆ ∂ ∆n, is a
p-left Kan extension of F | C0. Then there exists a dotted arrow f rendering the diagram commutative.

Proof. The proof uses the same strategy as that of Lemma 4.3.2.7. Using Lemma 4.3.2.6 and Proposition
A.2.3.1, we may replace C by a minimal model and thereby assume that C is minimal. As in the proof of
Lemma 4.3.2.7, let us call a simplicial subset E ⊆ C complete if it has the following property: for any simplex
σ : ∆n → C, if σ|∆{0,...,i} factors through C0 and σ|∆{i+1,...,n} factors through E, then σ factors through E.
Let P denote the partially ordered set of pairs (E, fE), where E ⊆ C is complete and fE is a map rendering

that P has a maximal element (E, fE). If E = C, we may take f = fE and the proof is complete. Otherwise,
choose a simplex σ : ∆m → C which does not belong to E, where m is as small as possible. It follows that σ

F | C0). It follows that g0(0, 0) is ψ0-initial when regarded as a vertex of X{0}. Applying Proposition 4.3.1.14,
we deduce that g0(0, 0) is ψ-initial when regarded as a vertex of X. Lemma 4.3.2.10 now guarantees the
existence of the dotted arrow g, contradicting the maximality of (E, fE).

The following result addresses the existence problem for left Kan extensions:

extension of F0.

(2) For every object C ∈ C, the diagram given by the composition

admits a p-colimit.

/C → C0 F0→ D

Proof. It is clear that (1) implies (2). Let us therefore suppose that (2) is satisﬁed; we wish to prove that
F0 admits a left Kan extension. We will follow the basic strategy used in the proofs of Lemmas 4.3.2.7
and 4.3.2.12. Using Proposition A.2.3.1 and Lemma 4.3.2.6, we can replace the inclusion C0 ⊆ C by any
categorically equivalent inclusion C′0
⊆ C′. Using Proposition 2.3.3.8, we can choose C′ to be a minimal
model for C; we thereby reduce to the case where C is itself a minimal ∞-category.

We will say that a simplicial subset E ⊆ C is complete if it has the following property: for any simplex
σ : ∆n → C, if σ|∆{0,...,i} factors through C0 and σ|∆{i+1,...,n} factors through E, then σ factors through E.

This partially ordered set satisﬁes the hypotheses of Zorn’s lemma, and therefore has a maximal element
which we will denote by (E, fE). If E = C, then fE is a p-left Kan extension of F0 and the proof is complete.
Suppose that E 6= C. Then there is a simplex σ : ∆n → C which does not factor through E; choose such
a simplex where n is as small as possible. The minimality of n guarantees that σ is nondegenerate, that
σ| ∂ ∆n factors through E, and (if n > 0) that σ(0) /∈ C0. Form a pushout diagram

This diagram induces a map E′ → C, which is easily shown to be a monomorphism of simplicial sets; we may
therefore identify E′ with its image in C. Since C is minimal, we can apply Proposition 2.3.3.9 to deduce
that E′ ⊆ C is complete. Since (E, FE) ∈ P is maximal, it follows that we cannot extend FE to a functor

of such an extension follows from assumption (2). If n > 0, let C = σ(0); then the projection C0

where the horizontal arrows are categorical equivalences. Since (E, fE) ∈ P , (r ◦ g0)(0) is a p′′-initial vertex of
Dq′/. Applying Proposition 4.3.1.6, we conclude that g0(0) is a p′-initial vertex of Dq/, which guarantees the
existence of the desired extension g. This contradicts the maximality of (E, fE) and completes the proof.

Corollary 4.3.2.14. Let p : D → E be a coCartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories. Suppose that each ﬁber
of p admits small colimits, and that for every morphism E → E′ in E, the associated functor DE → DE′
preserves small colimits. Let C be a small ∞-category, and C0 ⊆ C a full subcategory. Then every functor
F0 : C0 → D admits a left Kan extension relative to p.

Proof. This follows immediately from Lemma 4.3.2.13 and Corollary 4.3.1.11.

Combining Lemmas 4.3.2.12 and 4.3.2.13, we deduce:

Proposition 4.3.2.15. Suppose given a diagram of ∞-categories

C → D′ p

← D,

where p is an inner ﬁbration. Let C0 be a full subcategory of C. Let K ⊆ MapD′ (C, D) be the full subcategory
spanned by those functors F : C → D which are p-left Kan extensions of F | C0. Let K′ ⊆ MapD′ (C0, D) be
the full subcategory spanned by those functors F0 : C0 → D with the property that, for each object C ∈ C,
/C → D has a p-colimit. Then the restriction functor K → K′ is a trivial ﬁbration of
the induced diagram C0
simplicial sets.

Corollary 4.3.2.16. Suppose given a diagram of ∞-categories

C → D′ p

← D,

where p is an inner ﬁbration. Let C0 be a full subcategory of C. Suppose further that, for every functor
F0 ∈ MapD′(C0, D), there exists a functor F ∈ MapD′(C, D) which is a p-left Kan extension of F0. Then
the restriction map i∗ : MapD′(C, D) → MapD′(C0, D) admits a section i!, whose essential image consists of
precisely of those functors F which are p-left Kan extensions of F | C0.

In the situation of Corollary 4.3.2.16, we will refer to i! as a left Kan extension functor. We note that
Proposition 4.3.2.15 proves not only the existence of i!, but also its uniqueness up to homotopy (the collection
of all such functors is parametrized by a contractible Kan complex). The following characterization of i!
gives a second explanation for its uniqueness:

Proposition 4.3.2.17. Suppose given a diagram of ∞-categories

C → D′ p

← D,

where p is an inner ﬁbration. Let i : C0 ⊆ C be the inclusion of a full subcategory, and suppose that
every functor F0 ∈ MapD′(C0, D) admits a p-left Kan extension. Then the left Kan extension functor i! :
MapD′(C0, D) → MapD′ (C, D) is a left adjoint to the restriction functor i∗ : MapD′ (C, D) → MapD′ (C0, D).

Proof. Since i∗ ◦ i! is the identity functor on MapD′ (C0, D), there is an obvious candidate for the unit

u : id → i∗ ◦ i!

of the adjunction: namely, the identity. According to Proposition 5.2.2.8, it will suﬃce to prove that for
every F ∈ MapD′(C0, D), G ∈ MapD′ (C, D), composition with u induces a homotopy equivalence

MapMapD′ (C,D)(i!F, G) → MapMapD′ (C0,D)(i∗i!F, i∗G) u→ MapMapD′ (C0,D)(F, i∗G)

in the homotopy category H. This morphism in H is represented by the restriction map

HomR

MapD′ (C,D)(i!F, G) → HomR

MapD′ (C0,D)(F, i∗G)

which is a trivial ﬁbration by Lemma 4.3.2.12.

Remark 4.3.2.18. Throughout this section we have focused our attention on the theory of (relative) left
Kan extensions. There is an entirely dual theory of right Kan extensions in the ∞-categorical setting, which
can be obtained from the theory of left Kan extensions by passing to opposite ∞-categories.

4.3.3 Kan Extensions along General Functors

Our goal in this section is to generalize the theory of Kan extensions to the case where the change of diagram
category is not necessarily given by a fully faithful inclusion C0 ⊆ C. As in §4.3.2, we will discuss only the
theory of left Kan extensions; a dual theory of right Kan extensions can be obtained by passing to opposite
∞-categories.

The ideas introduced in this section are relatively elementary extensions of the ideas of §4.3.2. However,
we will encounter a new complication. Let δ : C → C′ be a change of diagram ∞-category, f : C → D a
functor, and δ!(f ) : C′ → D its left Kan extension along δ (to be deﬁned below). Then one does not generally
expect that δ∗δ!(f ) to be equivalent to the original functor f . Instead, one has only a unit transformation
f → δ∗δ!(f ). To set up the theory, this unit transformation must be taken as part of the data. Consequently,
the theory of Kan extensions in general requires more elaborate notation and terminology than the special
case treated in §4.3.2. We will compensate for this by considering only the case of absolute left Kan extensions.
It is straightforward to set up a relative theory as in §4.3.2, but we will not need such a theory in this book.

Deﬁnition 4.3.3.1. Let δ : K → K ′ be a map of simplicial sets, let D be an ∞-category, and let f : K → D
be a diagram. A left extension of f along δ consists of a map f ′ : K ′ → D and a morphism f → f ′ ◦ δ in the
∞-category Fun(K, D).

Equivalently, we may view a left extension of f : K → D along δ : K → K ′ as a map F : M op(δ) → D
K×{1} K ′ denotes the mapping cylinder of δ.

such that F |K = f , where M op(δ) = M (δop)op = (K × ∆1)

Deﬁnition 4.3.3.2. Let δ : K → K ′ be a map of simplicial sets, and let F : M op(δ) → D be a diagram in
an ∞-category D (which we view as a left extension of f = F |K along δ). We will say that F is a left Kan
extension of f along δ if there exists a commutative diagram

Remark 4.3.3.3. In the situation of Deﬁnition 4.3.3.2, the map p : K → ∆1 is automatically a coCartesian
ﬁbration. To prove this, choose a factorization

M (δop)♮

i→ (K′)♯ → (∆1)♯

where i is marked anodyne, and K′ → ∆1 is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Then i is a quasi-equivalence, so that
Proposition 3.2.2.7 implies that M (δop) → K′ is a categorical equivalence. It follows that K is equivalent to
(K′)op (via an equivalence which respects the projection to ∆1), so that the projection p is a coCartesian
ﬁbration.

The following result asserts that the condition of Deﬁnition 4.3.3.2 is essentially independent of the choice

of K.

Proposition 4.3.3.4. Let δ : K → K ′ be a map of simplicial sets, and let F : M op(δ) → D be a diagram in
an ∞-category D which is a left Kan extension along δ. Let

M op F ′′

"EEEEEEEE

K

be a diagram where F ′′ is both a coﬁbration and a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets. Then F = F ′◦F ′′,
for some map F ′ : K → D which is a left Kan extension of F ′| K ×∆1{0}.

Proof. By hypothesis, there exists a commutative diagram

∆1

where K′ is an ∞-category, F = G′ ◦ G′′, and G′′ is a categorical equivalence, and G′ is a left Kan extension
of G′| K′ ×∆1{0}. Since K′ is an ∞-category, there exists a map r as indicated in the diagram such that
G′′ = r ◦ F ′′. We note that r is a categorical equivalence so that the commutativity of the lower triangle
p = q ◦ r follows automatically. We now deﬁne F ′ = G′ ◦ r, and note that part (2) of Lemma 4.3.2.6 implies
that F ′ is a left Kan extension of F ′| K ×∆1{0}.

We have now introduced two diﬀerent deﬁnitions of left Kan extensions: Deﬁnition 4.3.2.2, which applies
in the situation of an inclusion C0 ⊆ C of a full subcategory into an ∞-category C, and Deﬁnition 4.3.3.2
which applies in the case of a general map δ : K → K ′ of simplicial sets. These two deﬁnitions are essentially
the same. More precisely, we have the following assertion:

Proposition 4.3.3.5. Let C and D be ∞-categories, and let δ : C0 → C denote the inclusion of a full
subcategory.

(1) Let f : C → D be a functor, f0 its restriction to C0, so that (f, idf0 ) can be viewed as a left extension of
f0 along δ. Then (f, idf0) is a left Kan extension of f0 along δ if and only if f is a left Kan extension
of f0.

(2) A functor f0 : C0 → D has a left Kan extension if and only if it has a left Kan extension along δ.

Proof. Let K denote the full subcategory of C ×∆1 spanned by the objects (C, {i}) where either C ∈ C0 or
i = 1, so that we have inclusions

M op(δ) ⊆ K ⊆ C ×∆1.
To prove (1), suppose that f : C → D is a left Kan extension of f0 = f | C0 and let F denote the composite
map

K ⊆ C ×∆1 → C f

→ D .

It follows immediately that F is a left Kan extension of F | C0 ×{0}, so that F |M op(δ) is a left Kan extension
of f0 along δ.

To prove (2), we observe that the “only if” follows from (1); the converse follows from the existence

criterion of Lemma 4.3.2.13.

Suppose that δ : K 0 → K 1 is a map of simplicial sets, D an ∞-category, and that every diagram K 0 → D

admits a left Kan extension along δ. Choose a diagram

M op(δ)

j

∆1

K

~~~~~~~~~

where j is inner anodyne and K is an ∞-category, which we regard as a correspondence from K0 = K ×∆1{0}
to K1 = K ×∆1{1}. Let C denote the full subcategory of Fun(K, D) spanned by those functors F : K → D
such that F is a left Kan extension of F0 = F | K0. The restriction map p : C → Fun(K 0, D) can be written
as a composition of C → DK0
(a trivial ﬁbration by Proposition 4.3.2.15) and Fun(K0, D) → Fun(K 0, D)
(a trivial ﬁbration since K 0 → K0 is inner anodyne), and is therefore a trivial ﬁbration. Let δ! be the
composition of a section of p with the restriction map C ⊆ Fun(K, D) → Fun(M op(δ), D), and let δ! denote
the composition of δ! with the restriction map Fun(M op(δ), D) → Fun(K 1, D). Then δ! and δ! are well-
deﬁned up to equivalence, at least once K has been ﬁxed (independence of the choice of K will follow from
the characterization given in Proposition 4.3.3.7). We will abuse terminology by referring to both δ! and δ!
as left Kan extension along δ (it should be clear from context which of these functors is meant in a given
situation). We observe that δ! assigns to each object f0 : K 0 → D a left Kan extension of f0 along δ.
Example 4.3.3.6. Let C and D be ∞-categories, and let i : C0 → C be the inclusion of a full subcategory.
Suppose that i! : Fun(C0, D) → Fun(C, D) is a section of i∗, which satisﬁes the conclusion of Corollary
4.3.2.16. Then i! is a left Kan extension along i in the sense deﬁned above; this follows easily from Proposition
4.3.3.5.

Left Kan extension functors admit the following characterization:

Proposition 4.3.3.7. Let δ : K 0 → K 1 be a map of simplicial sets, let D be an ∞-category, let δ∗ :
Fun(K 1, D) → Fun(K 0, D) be the restriction functor, and let δ! : Fun(K 0, D) → Fun(K 1, D) be a functor of
left Kan extension along δ. Then δ! is a left adjoint of δ∗.
Proof. The map δ can be factored as a composition

K 0 i→ M op(δ) r→ K 1
where r denotes the natural retraction of M op(δ) onto K 1. Consequently, δ∗ = i∗ ◦ r∗. Proposition 4.3.2.17
implies that the left Kan extension functor δ! is a left adjoint to i∗. By Proposition 5.2.2.6, it will suﬃce
to prove that r∗ is a right adjoint to the restriction functor j∗ : Fun(M op(δ), D) → Fun(K 1, D). Using
Corollary 2.4.7.12, we deduce that j∗ is a coCartesian ﬁbration. Moreover, there is a simplicial homotopy
Fun(M op(δ), D) × ∆1 → Fun(M op(δ), D) from the identity to r∗ ◦ j∗, which is a ﬁberwise homotopy over
Fun(K 1, D).
It follows that for every object F of Fun(K 1, D), r∗F is a ﬁnal object of the ∞-category
Fun(M op(δ), D) ×Fun(K 1,D) {F }. Applying Proposition 5.2.4.3, we deduce that r∗ is right adjoint to j∗ as
desired.

Let δ : K 0 → K 1 be a map of simplicial sets and D an ∞-category which which that left Kan extension δ! :
Fun(K 0, D) → δ! Fun(K 1, D) is deﬁned. In general, the terminology “Kan extension” is perhaps somewhat
unfortunate: if F : K 0 → D is a diagram, then δ∗δ!F need not coincide with F , even up to equivalence. If δ
is fully faithful, then the unit map F → δ∗δ!F is an equivalence: this follows from Proposition 4.3.3.5. We
will later need the following more precise assertion:
Proposition 4.3.3.8. Let δ : C0 → C1 and f0 : C0 → D be functors between ∞-categories, and let f1 : C1 →
D, α : f0 → δ∗f1 = f1 ◦ δ be a left Kan extension of f0 along δ. Let C be an object of C0 such that, for every
C′ ∈ C0, the functor δ induces an isomorphism

MapC0(C′, C) → MapC1 (δC′, δC)

in the homotopy category H. Then the morphism α(C) : f0(C) → f1(δC) is an equivalence in D.

Proof. Choose a diagram

M op(δ) G

#GGGGGGGGG

M

F

∆1

where M is a correspondence from C0 to C1 associated to δ, F is a left Kan extension of f0 = F | C0, and
F ◦ G is the map M op(δ) → D determined by f0, f1, and α. Let u : C → δC be the morphism in M given
by the image of {C} × ∆1 ⊆ M op(δ) under G. Then α(C) = F (u), so it will suﬃce to prove that F (u) is an
equivalence. Since F is a left Kan extension of f0 at δC, the composition

(C0

/δC )⊲ → M F→ D

is a colimit diagram. Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that u : C → δC is a ﬁnal object of C0
the diagram

/δC . Consider

/C ← C0
C0
/u

q
→ C0

/δC .

The ∞-category on the left has a ﬁnal object idC , and the map on the left is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial
sets. We deduce that s0u is a ﬁnal object of C0
/δC , it will suﬃce to show that q is an
equivalence of ∞-categories. We observe that q is a map of right ﬁbrations over C0. According to Proposition
3.3.1.5, it will suﬃce to show that for each object C′ in C0, the map q induces a homotopy equivalence of
Kan complexes

/u. Since q(s0u) = u ∈ C0

C0
/u ×C0 {C′} → C0

/δC ×C0 {C′}.

This map can be identiﬁed with the map

MapC0 (C′, C) → MapM(C′, δC) ≃ MapC1(δC′, δC),

in the homotopy category H, and is therefore a homotopy equivalence by assumption.

We conclude this section by proving that the construction of left Kan extensions behaves well in families.

f1 : Y → C, α : f0 → f1 ◦ δ be a left extension of f0. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The transformation α exhibits f1 as a left Kan extension of f0 along δ.

(2) For each vertex s ∈ S, the restriction αs : f0|Xs → (f1 ◦ δ)|Xs exhibits f1|Ys as a left Kan extension

have a unit map

u : M op(δ) → M ×S′S.
Theorem 3.2.0.1 implies that the induced maps u0 : X → M0 ×S′S, u1 : Y → M1 ×S′S are equivalences
of coCartesian ﬁbrations. Proposition 3.3.1.3 implies that the maps M0 ×S′S → M0, M1 ×S′S → M1 are
categorical equivalences.

Let u′ denote the composition

0 : X → M0, u′

are categorical equivalences. Consequently, the map u′ is a quasi-equivalence of coCartesian ﬁbrations over
∆1, and therefore a categorical equivalence (Proposition 3.2.2.7). Replacing M by the product M ×K if
necessary, where K is a contractible Kan complex, we may suppose that u′ is a coﬁbration of simplicial sets.
Since D is an ∞-category, there exists a functor F : M → D as indicated in the diagram below:

Consequently, we may reformulate condition (1) as follows:

(1′) The functor F is a left Kan extension of F | M0.

Proposition 3.3.1.5 now implies that, for each vertex s of S, the map Xs → M0

s is a categorical equivalence.
Similarly, for each vertex s of S, the inclusion Ys → M1
s is a categorical equivalence. It follows that the
inclusion M op(δ)s → Ms is a quasi-equivalence, and therefore a categorical equivalence (Proposition 3.2.2.7).
Consequently, we may reformulate condition (2) as follows:

(2′) For each vertex s ∈ S, the functor F | Ms is a left Kan extension of F | M0
s.

Using Lemma 4.3.2.6, it is easy to see that the collection of objects s ∈ S′ such that F | Ms is a left Kan
s is stable under equivalence. Since the inclusion S ⊆ S′ is a categorical equivalence, we

extension of F | M0
conclude that (2′) is equivalent to the following apparently stronger condition:

(2′′) For every object s ∈ S′, the functor F | Ms is a left Kan extension of F | M0
s.

The equivalence of (1′) and (2′′) follows from Lemma 4.3.3.9.

4.4 Examples of Colimits

In this section, we will analyze in detail the colimits of some very simple diagrams. Our ﬁrst three examples
are familiar from classical category theory: coproducts (§4.4.1), pushouts (§4.4.2), and coequalizers (§4.4.3).
Our fourth example is slightly more unfamiliar. Let C be an ordinary category which admits coproducts.
Then C is naturally tensored over the category of sets. Namely, for each C ∈ C and S ∈ Set, we can
deﬁne C ⊗ S to be the coproduct of a collection of copies of C, indexed by the set S. The object C ⊗ S is
characterized by the following universal mapping property:

HomC(C ⊗ S, D) ≃ HomSet(S, HomC(C, D)).

In the ∞-categorical setting, it is natural to try to generalize this deﬁnition by allowing S to an object of S.
In this case, C ⊗ S can again be viewed as a kind of colimit, but cannot be written as a coproduct unless S
is discrete. We will study the situation in §4.4.4.

Our ﬁnal objective in this section is to study the theory of retracts in an ∞-category C. In §4.4.5, we
will see that there is a close relationship between retracts in C and idempotent endomorphisms, just as in
classical homotopy theory. Namely, any retract of an object C ∈ C determines an idempotent endomorphism
of C; conversely, if C is idempotent complete, then every idempotent endomorphism of C determines a retract
of C. We will return to this idea in §5.1.4.

4.4.1 Coproducts

In this section, we discuss the simplest type of colimit: namely, coproducts. Let A be a set; we may regard
A as a category with

HomA(I, J) =

∗
∅
(

if I = J
if I 6= J.

We will also identify A with the (constant) simplicial set which is the nerve of this category. We note a
functor G : A → Set∆ is injectively ﬁbrant if and only if it takes values in the category Kan of Kan complexes.
If this condition is satisﬁed, then the product

α∈A G(α) is a homotopy limit for G.

Let F : A → C be a functor from A to a ﬁbrant simplicial category; in other words, F speciﬁes a collection
{Xα}α∈A of objects in C. A homotopy colimit for F will be referred to as a homotopy coproduct of the objects
{Xα}α∈A. Unwinding the deﬁnition, we see that a homotopy coproduct is an object X ∈ C equipped with
morphisms φα : Xα → X such that the induced map

Q

MapC(X, Y ) →

MapC(Xα, Y )

Yα∈A
is a homotopy equivalence for every object Y ∈ C. Consequently, we recover the description given in Example
1.2.13.1. As we noted earlier, this characterization can be stated entirely in terms of the enriched homotopy
category hC: the maps {φα} exhibit X as a homotopy coproduct of the family {Xα}α∈A if and only if the
induced map

is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H of spaces, for each Y ∈ C.

Yα∈A

MapC(X, Y ) →

MapC(Xα, Y )

Now suppose that C is an ∞-category, and let p : A → C be a map. As above, we may identify this with
a collection of objects {Xα}α∈A of C. To specify an object of Cp/ is to give an object X ∈ C together with
morphisms φα : Xα → X for each α ∈ A. Using Theorem 4.2.4.1, we deduce that X is a colimit of the
diagram p if and only if the induced map

MapC(X, Y ) →

MapC(Xα, Y )

{Xα}α∈A.

In either setting, we will denote the (homotopy) coproduct of a family of objects {Xα}α∈A by

It is well-deﬁned up to (essentially unique) equivalence.
Using Corollary 4.2.3.10, we deduce the following:

Proposition 4.4.1.1. Let C be an ∞-category, and let {pα : Kα → C}α∈A be a family of diagrams in C
indexed by a set A. Suppose that each pα has a colimit Xα in C. Let K =
Kα, and let p : K → C be the
result of amalgamating the maps pα. Then p has a colimit in C if and only if the family {Xα}α∈A has a
coproduct in C; in this case, one may identify colimits of p with coproducts

4.4.2 Pushouts

Let C be an ∞-category. A square in C is a map ∆1 × ∆1 → C. We will typically denote squares in C by
diagrams

p

Y ′

X

q

/ Y,

with the “diagonal” morphism r : X ′ → Y and homotopies r ≃ q ◦ p′, r ≃ p ◦ q′ being implicit.

We have isomorphisms of simplicial sets

(Λ2

0)⊲ ≃ ∆1 × ∆1 ≃ (Λ2

2)⊳.

Consequently, given a square σ : ∆1 × ∆1 → C, it makes sense to ask whether or not σ is a limit or colimit
diagram. If σ is a limit diagram, we will also say that σ is a pullback square or a Cartesian square, and we
will informally write X ′ = X ×Y Y ′. Dually, if σ is a colimit diagram, we will say that σ is a pushout square
or a coCartesian square, and write Y = X

Now suppose that C is a (ﬁbrant) simplicial category. By deﬁnition, a commutative diagram

is a homotopy pullback square in Kan. Using Theorem 4.2.4.1, we can reduce questions about pushout
diagrams in an arbitrary ∞-category to questions about homotopy pullback squares in Kan.

The following basic transitivity property for pushout squares will be used repeatedly throughout this

book:

Suppose that the left square is a pushout in C. Then the right square is a pushout if and only if the outer

Proof. For every subset A of {x, y, z, x′, y′, z′}, let D(A) denote the corresponding full subcategory of ∆2 ×
∆1, and let σ(A) denote the restriction of σ to D(A). We may regard σ as determining an object
σ ∈

The map on φ is the composition of the trivial ﬁbration

Our next objective is to apply Proposition 4.2.3.8 to show that in many cases, complicated colimits may

be decomposed as pushouts of simpler colimits. Suppose given a pushout diagram of simplicial sets

and a diagram p : K → C, where C is an ∞-category. Suppose furthermore that p|K ′, p|L′, and p|L admit
colimits in C, which we will denote by X, Y , and Z, respectively. If we suppose further that the map i is
a coﬁbration of simplicial sets, then the hypotheses of Proposition 4.2.3.4 are satisﬁed. Consequently, we
deduce:

Proposition 4.4.2.2. Let C be an ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a map of simplicial sets. Suppose given
a decomposition K = K ′
L′ L, where L′ → L is a monomorphism of simplicial sets. Suppose further that
p|K ′ has a colimit X ∈ C, p|L′ has a colimit Y ∈ C, and p|L has a colimit Z ∈ C. Then one may identify
colimits for p with pushouts X

Y Z.

Remark 4.4.2.3. The statement of Proposition 4.4.2.2 is slightly vague. Implicit in the discussion is that
identiﬁcations of X with the colimit of p|K ′ and Y with the colimit of p|L′ induce a morphism Y → X in
C (and similarly for Y and Z). This morphism is not uniquely determined, but it is determined up to a
contractible space of choices: see the proof of Proposition 4.2.3.4.

It follows from Proposition 4.4.2.2 that any ﬁnite colimit can be built using initial objects and pushout

squares. For example, we have the following:

Corollary 4.4.2.4. Let C be an ∞-category. Then C admits all ﬁnite colimits if and only if C admits
pushouts and has an initial object.

Proof. The “only if” direction is clear. For the converse, let us suppose that C has pushouts and an initial
object. Let p : K → C be any diagram, where K is a ﬁnite simplicial set: that is, K has only ﬁnitely many
nondegenerate simplices. We will prove that p has a colimit. The proof goes by induction: ﬁrst on the
dimension of K, then on the number of simplices of K having the maximal dimension.

If K is empty, then an initial object of C is a colimit for p. Otherwise, we may ﬁx a nondegenerate
∂ ∆n ∆n. By the inductive
simplex of K having the maximal dimension, and thereby decompose K ≃ K0
hypothesis, p|K0 has a colimit X and p| ∂ ∆n has a colimit Y . The ∞-category ∆n has a ﬁnal object, so
p|∆n has a colimit Z (which we may take to be p(v), where v is the ﬁnal vertex of ∆n). Now we simply
apply Proposition 4.4.2.2 to deduce that X

Y Z is a colimit for p.

`

Using the same argument, one can show:

`

Corollary 4.4.2.5. Let f : C → C′ be a functor between ∞-categories. Assume that C has all ﬁnite colimits.
Then f preserves all ﬁnite colimits if and only if f preserves initial objects and pushouts.

We conclude by showing how all colimits can be constructed out of simple ones.

Proposition 4.4.2.6. Let C be an ∞-category. Suppose that C admits pushouts and κ-small coproducts.
Then C admits colimits for all κ-small diagrams.

Proof. If κ = ω, we have already shown this as Corollary 4.4.2.4. Let us therefore suppose that κ > ω, and
that C has pushouts and κ-small sums.

Let p : K → C be a diagram, where K is κ-small. We ﬁrst suppose that the dimension n of K is ﬁnite:
that is, K has no nondegenerate simplices of dimension > n. We prove that p has a colimit, working by
induction on n.

If n = 0, then K consists of a ﬁnite disjoint union of fewer than κ vertices. The colimit of p exists by the

assumption that C has κ-small sums.

Now suppose that every diagram indexed by a κ-small simplicial set of dimension n has a colimit. Let
p : K → C be a diagram, with the dimension of K equal to n + 1. Let K n denote the n-skeleton of K, and
K ′
n+1 ⊆ Kn+1 the set of all nondegenerate (n + 1)-simplices of K, so that there is a pushout diagram of
simplicial sets

By Proposition 4.4.2.2, we can construct a colimit of p as a pushout, using colimits for p|K n, p|(K ′
∂ ∆n+1), and p|(K ′
of diagrams which possess colimits.

n+1 ×
n+1 × ∆n+1). The ﬁrst two exist by the inductive hypothesis; the last, because it is a sum

Now let us suppose that K is not necessarily ﬁnite dimensional. In this case, we can ﬁlter K by its
skeleta {K n}. This is a family of simplicial subsets of K indexed by the set Z≥0 of nonnegative integers.
By what we have shown above, each p|K n has a colimit xn in C. Since this family is directed and covers K,
Corollary 4.2.3.10 shows that we may identify colimits of p with colimits of a diagram N(Z≥0) → C which
we may write informally as

x0 → x1 → . . .

Let L be the simplicial subset of N(Z≥0) which consists of all vertices, together with the edges which
join consecutive integers. A simple computation shows that the inclusion L ⊆ N(Z≥0) is a categorical
equivalence, and therefore coﬁnal. Consequently, it suﬃces to construct the colimit of a diagram L → C.
But L is 1-dimensional, and is κ-small since κ > ω.

243

The same argument proves also the following:

Proposition 4.4.2.7. Let κ be a regular cardinal, and let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories,
where C admits κ-small colimits. Then f preserves κ-small colimits if and only if f preserves pushout squares
and κ-small coproducts.

Let D be an ∞-category containing an object X, and suppose that D admits pushouts. Then DX/ admits
pushouts, and these pushouts map be computed in D. In other words, the projection f : DX/ → D preserves
pushouts. In fact, this is a special case of a very general result; it requires only that f is a left ﬁbration and
the simplicial set Λ2

0 is weakly contractible.

Lemma 4.4.2.8. Let f : C → D be a left ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let K be a weakly contractible
simplicial set. Then any map p : K ⊲ → C is an f -colimit diagram.

Proof. Let p = p|K. We must show that the map

φ : Cp/ → Cp/ ×Df ◦p/

Df ◦p/

is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. In other words, we must show that we can solve any lifting problem
of the form

(K ⋆ A)

K⋆A0

K ⊲ ⋆ A

(K ⊲ ⋆ A)

C

f

D .

Since f is a left ﬁbration, it will suﬃce to prove that the left vertical map is left anodyne, which follows
immediately from Lemma 4.2.3.5.

Proposition 4.4.2.9. Let f : C → D be a left ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let p : K → C be a diagram.
Suppose that K is weakly contractible. Then:

(1) Let p : K ⊲ → C be an extension of p. Then p is a colimit of p if and only if f ◦ p is a colimit of f ◦ p.

(2) Let q : K ⊲ → D be a colimit of f ◦ p. Then q = f ◦ p, where p is an extension ( automatically a colimit,

in virtue of (1) ) of p.

Proof. To prove (1), ﬁx an extension p : K ⊲ → C. We have a commutative diagram

φ

Cp/

/ Cp/ ×Df p/

Df p/

ψ′

Cp/

/ Df p/ .

Lemma 4.4.2.8 implies that φ is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. If f ◦ p is a colimit diagram, the map ψ is a trivial
ﬁbration. Since ψ′ is a pullback of ψ, we conclude that ψ′ is a trivial ﬁbration. It follows that ψ′ ◦ φ is a
trivial ﬁbration, so that p is a colimit diagram. This proves the “if” direction of (1).

To prove the converse, let us suppose that p is a colimit diagram. The maps φ and ψ′ ◦ φ are both trivial
ﬁbrations. It follows that the ﬁbers of ψ′ are contractible. Using Lemma 4.2.3.6, we conclude that the map
θ is a trivial ﬁbration, and therefore surjective on vertices. It follows that the ﬁbers of ψ are contractible.
Since ψ is a left ﬁbration with contractible ﬁbers, it is a trivial ﬁbration (Lemma 2.1.3.4). Thus f ◦ p is a
colimit diagram and the proof is complete.

To prove (2), it suﬃces to show that f has the right lifting property with respect to the inclusion
i : K ⊆ K ⊲. Since f is a left ﬁbration, it will suﬃce to show that i is left anodyne, which follows immediately
from Lemma 4.2.3.6.

4.4.3 Coequalizers

Let I denote the category depicted by the diagram

X

F

G

/ Y .

In other words, I has two objects, X and Y , with HomI(X, X) = HomI(Y, Y ) = ∗, HomI(Y, X) = ∅, and
HomI(X, Y ) = {F, G}.

To give a diagram p : N(I) → C in an ∞-category C, one must give a pair of morphisms f = p(F ),
g = p(G) in C, having the same domain x = p(X) and the same codomain y = p(Y ). A colimit for the
diagram p is said to be a coequalizer of f and g.

Applying Corollary 4.2.3.10, we deduce the following:

Proposition 4.4.3.1. Let K and A be a simplicial sets, and let i0, i1 : A → K be embeddings having disjoint
images in K. Let K ′ denote the coequalizer of i0 and i1; in other words, the simplicial set obtained from K
by identifying the image of i0 with the image of i1. Let p : K ′ → C be a diagram in an ∞-category S, and
let q : K → C be the composition

K → K ′ p

→ S.

Suppose that the diagrams q ◦ i0 = q ◦ i1 and q possess colimits x and y in S. Then i0 and i1 induce maps
j0, j1 : x → y (well-deﬁned up to homotopy); colimits for p may be identiﬁed with coequalizers of j0 and j1.

Like pushouts, coequalizers are a basic construction out of which other colimits can be built. More

speciﬁcally, we have the following:

Proposition 4.4.3.2. Let C be an ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. Then C has all κ-small colimits if
and only if C has coequalizers and κ-small coproducts.

In view of Proposition 4.4.2.6, it suﬃces to show that C has pushouts. Let p : Λ2

Proof. The “only if” direction is obvious. For the converse, suppose that C has coequalizers and κ-small

pushout diagram in C. We note that Λ2
∆{0,2} obtained by identifying the initial
vertex of ∆{0,1} with the initial vertex of ∆{0,2}. In view of Proposition 4.4.3.1, it suﬃces to show that
∆{0,2}) and p|{0} possess colimits in C. The second assertion is obvious. Since C has ﬁnite sums,
p|(∆{0,1}
to prove that there exists a colimit for p|(∆{0,1}
∆{0,2}), it suﬃces to prove that p|∆{0,1} and p|∆{0,2}
possess colimits in C. This is immediate, since ∆{0,1} and ∆{0,2} both have ﬁnal objects.

0 is the quotient of ∆{0,1}

`

`

`

Using the same argument, we deduce:

Proposition 4.4.3.3. Let κ be a regular cardinal and C be an ∞-category which admits κ-small colimits.
A full subcategory D ⊆ C is stable under κ-small colimits in C if and only if D is stable under coequalizers
and under κ-small sums.

4.4.4 Tensoring with Spaces

Every ordinary category C can be regarded as a category enriched over Set. Moreover, if C admits coproducts,
then C can be regarded as tensored over Set, in an essentially unique way. In the ∞-categorical setting, one
if C is an ∞-category which admits all small limits, then C may be regarded as
has a similar situation:
tensored over the ∞-category S of spaces. To make this idea precise, we would need a good theory of
enriched ∞-categories, which lies outside the scope of this book. We will instead settle for a slightly ad-hoc
point of view which nevertheless allows us to construct the relevant tensor products. We begin with a few
remarks concerning representable functors in the ∞-categorical setting.

245

/
/

Deﬁnition 4.4.4.1. Let D be a closed monoidal category, and let C be a category enriched over D. We
will say that a D-enriched functor G : Cop → D is representable if there exists an object C ∈ C and a map
η : 1D → G(C) such that the induced map

MapC(X, C) ≃ MapC(X, C) ⊗ 1D → MapC(X, C) ⊗ G(C) → G(X)

is an isomorphism, for every object X ∈ C. In this case, we will say that (C, η) represents the functor F .

Remark 4.4.4.2. In the situation of Deﬁnition 4.4.4.1, we will sometimes abuse terminology and simply
say that the functor F is represented by the object C.

Remark 4.4.4.3. The dual notion of a corepresentable functor is may be deﬁned in an obvious way.

Deﬁnition 4.4.4.4. Let C be an ∞-category, and let S denote the ∞-category of spaces. We will say that
a functor F : Cop → S is representable if the underlying functor

hF : hCop → hS ≃ H

of ( H-enriched ) homotopy categories is representable. We will say that a pair C ∈ C, η ∈ π0F (C) represents
F if the pair (C, η) represents hF .

C, C = f (

can be identiﬁed, in the homotopy category H, with the map MapC(D, C) → F (C). The map φD is a

equivalence, and therefore a trivial ﬁbration. It follows that the ﬁbers of φ are contractible. Since φ is a right

ﬁbration, it is a trivial ﬁbration (Lemma 2.1.3.4). This proves that

C is right anodyne, and therefore a contravariant equivalence
by Proposition 4.1.2.1. Thus (2) ⇒ (3). Conversely, suppose that (3) is satisﬁed. The inclusion {idC } ⊆ C/C

Remark 4.4.4.7. All of the above ideas dualize in an evident way, so that we may speak of corepresentable
functors and corepresentable left ﬁbrations in the setting of ∞-categories.

Notation 4.4.4.8. For each diagram p : K → C in an ∞-category C, we let Fp : hC → H denote the
H-enriched functor corresponding to the left ﬁbration Cp/ → C.

If p : ∗ → C is the inclusion of an object X of C, then we write FX for Fp. We note that FX is the functor

corepresented by X:

FX (Y ) = MapC(X, Y ).

Now suppose that X is an object in an ∞-category C, and let p : K → C be a constant map taking the
value X. For every object Y of C, we have an isomorphism of simplicial sets (Cp/) ×C {Y } ≃ (CX/ ×C{Y })K.
This identiﬁcation is functorial up to homotopy, so we actually obtain an equivalence

Fp(Y ) ≃ MapC(X, Y )[K]

in the homotopy category H of spaces, where [K] denotes the simplicial set K regarded as an object of H.
Applying Proposition 4.4.4.5, we deduce the following:

Corollary 4.4.4.9. Let C be an ∞-category, X and object of C, and K a simplicial set. Let p : K → C be
the constant map taking the value X. The objects of the ﬁber Cp/ ×C{Y } are classiﬁed, up to equivalence,
by maps ψ : [K] → MapC(X, Y ) in the homotopy category H. Such a map ψ classiﬁes a colimit for p if and
only if it induces isomorphisms

in the homotopy category H, for every object Z of C.

MapC(Y, Z) ≃ MapC(X, Z)[K]

In the situation of Corollary 4.4.4.9, we will denote a colimit for p by X ⊗ K, if such a colimit exists. We
note that X ⊗K is well deﬁned up to (essentially unique) equivalence, and that it depends (up to equivalence)
only on the weak homotopy type of the simplicial set K.

Corollary 4.4.4.10. Let C be an ∞-category, let K be a weakly contractible simplicial set, and let p : K → C
be a diagram which carries each edge of K to an equivalence in C. Then:

(1) The diagram p has a colimit in C.

(2) An arbitrary extension p : K ⊲ → C is a colimit for C if and only if p carries each edge of K ⊲ → C to

an equivalence in C.

Proof. Let C′ ⊆ C be the largest Kan complex contained in C. By assumption, p factors through C′. Since K
is weakly contractible, we conclude that p : K → C′ is homotopic to a constant map p′ : K → C′. Replacing
p by p′ if necessary, we may reduce to the case where p is constant, taking value equal to some ﬁxed object
C ∈ C.

Let p : K ⊲ → C be the constant map with value C. Using the characterization of colimits in Corollary
4.4.4.9, we deduce that p is a colimit diagram in C. This proves (1), and (in view of the uniqueness of colimits
up to equivalence) the “only if” direction of (2). To prove the converse, we suppose that p′ is an arbitrary
extension of p which carries each edge of K ⊲ to an equivalence in C. Then p′ factors through C′. Since K ⊲ is
weakly contractible, we conclude as above that p′ is homotopic to a constant map, and is therefore a colimit
diagram.

4.4.5 Retracts and Idempotents

Let C be a category. An object Y ∈ C is said to be a retract of an object X ∈ C if there is a commutative
diagram

i

>~~~~~~~

X

idY

r

 @@@@@@@

Y

Y

in C. In this case we can identify Y with a subobject of X via the monomorphism i, and think of r as a
retraction from X onto Y ⊆ X. We observe also that the map i ◦ r : X → X is idempotent. Moreover,
this idempotent determines Y up to canonical isomorphism: we can recover Y as the equalizer of the pair of
maps (idX , i ◦ r) : X → X (or, dually, as the coequalizer of the same pair of maps). Consequently, we obtain
an injective map from the collection of isomorphism classes of retracts of X to the set of idempotent maps
f : X → X. We will say that C is idempotent complete if this correspondence is bijective for every X ∈ C:
that is, if every idempotent map f : X → X comes from a (uniquely determined) retract of X. If C admits
equalizers (or coequalizers), then C is idempotent complete.

These ideas can be adapted to the ∞-categorical setting in a straightforward way. If X and Y are objects
of an ∞-category C, then we say that Y is a retract of X if it is a retract of X in the homotopy category hC.
Equivalently, Y is a retract of X if there exists a 2-simplex ∆2 → C corresponding to a diagram

i

>~~~~~~~

X

 AAAAAAA

Y

As in the classical case, there is a correspondence between retracts Y of X and idempotent maps f : X → X.
However, there are two important diﬀerences: ﬁrst, the notion of an idempotent map needs to be interpreted
in an ∞-categorical sense. It is not enough to require that f = f ◦ f in the homotopy category hC. This
would correspond to the condition that there is a path p joining f to f ◦ f in the endomorphism space of
X, which would give rise to two paths from f to f ◦ f ◦ f . In order to have a hope of recovering Y , we need
these paths to be homotopic. This condition does not even make sense unless p is speciﬁed; thus we must
take p as part of the data of an idempotent map. In other words, in the ∞-categorical setting, idempotence
is not merely a condition, but involves additional data (see Deﬁnition 4.4.5.4).

The second important diﬀerence between the classical and ∞-categorical theory of retracts is that in the
∞-categorical case, one cannot recover a retract Y of X as the limit (or colimit) of a ﬁnite diagram involving
X.

Example 4.4.5.1. Let R be a commutative ring, and let C•(R) be the category of complexes of ﬁnite free

. . . → M1 → M0 → M−1 → . . .

such that each Mi is a ﬁnite free R-module, and Mi = 0 for |i| ≫ 0; morphisms in C•(R) are given by
morphisms of chain complexes. There is a natural simplicial structure on the category C•(R), for which
the mapping spaces are Kan complexes; let C = N(C•(R)) be the associated ∞-category. Then C admits
all ﬁnite limits and colimits (C is an example of a stable ∞-category; see [50]). However, C is idempotent
complete if and only if every ﬁnitely generated projective R-module is stably free.

The purpose of this section is to deﬁne the notion of an idempotent in an ∞-category C, and to obtain a

correspondence between idempotents and retracts in C.

Deﬁnition 4.4.5.2. The simplicial set Idem+ is deﬁned as follows:
for every nonempty, ﬁnite, linearly
ordered set J, HomSet∆ (∆J , Idem+) can be identiﬁed with the set of pairs (J0, ∼), where J0 ⊆ J and ∼ is
an equivalence relation on J0 which satisﬁes the following condition:

(∗) Let i ≤ j ≤ k be elements of J such that i, k ∈ J0, and i ∼ k. Then j ∈ J0, and i ∼ j ∼ k.

Let Idem denote the simplicial subset of Idem+, corresponding to those pairs (J0, ∼) such that J = J0.
Let Ret ⊆ Idem+ denote the simplicial subset corresponding to those pairs (J0, ∼) such that the quotient
J0/ ∼ has at most one element.

Remark 4.4.5.3. The simplicial set Idem has exactly one nondegenerate simplex in each dimension n
(corresponding to the equivalence relation ∼ on {0, 1, . . . , n} given by (i ∼ j) ⇔ (i = j) ), and the set of
nondegenerate simplices of Idem is stable under passage to faces. In fact, Idem is characterized up to unique
isomorphism by these two properties.

Deﬁnition 4.4.5.4. Let C be an ∞-category.

(1) An idempotent in C is a map of simplicial sets Idem → C. We will refer to Fun(Idem, C) as the

∞-category of idempotents in C.

(2) A weak retraction diagram in C is a map of simplicial sets Ret → C. We will refer to Fun(Ret, C) as

the ∞-category of weak retraction diagrams in C.

(3) A strong retraction diagram in C is a map of simplicial sets Idem+ → C. We will refer to Fun(Idem+, C)

as the ∞-category of strong retraction diagrams in C.

We now spell out Deﬁnition 4.4.5.4 in more concrete terms. We ﬁrst observe that Idem+ has precisely
two vertices. Once of these vertices, which we will denote by x, belongs to Idem, and the other, which we
will denote by y, does not. The simplicial set Ret can be identiﬁed with the quotient of ∆2 obtained by
collapsing ∆{0,2} to the vertex y. A weak retraction diagram F : Ret → C in an ∞-category C can therefore
be identiﬁed with a 2-simplex

where X = F (x) and Y = F (y). In other words, it is precisely the datum that we need in order to exhibit
Y as a retract of X in the homotopy category hC.

To give an idempotent F : Idem → C in C, it suﬃces to specify the image under F of each nondegenerate
simplex of Idem in each dimension n ≥ 0. Taking n = 0, we obtain an object X = F (x) ∈ C. Taking n = 1,
we get a morphism f : X → X. Taking n = 2, we get a 2-simplex of C corresponding to a diagram

The simplicial set Idem+ can be thought of as “interweaving” its simplicial subsets Idem and Ret, so

that giving a strong retraction diagram F : Idem+ → C is equivalent to giving a weak retraction diagram

Lemma 4.4.5.5. Let J ⊆ {0, . . . , n}, and let K ⊆ ∆n be the simplicial subset spanned by the nondegenerate
simplices of ∆n which do not contain ∆J . Suppose that there exist 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n such that i, k ∈ J,
j /∈ J. Then the inclusion K ⊆ ∆n is inner anodyne.

Proof. Let P denote the collection of all subset J ′ ⊆ {0, . . . , n} which contain J ∪ {j}. Choose a linear
ordering

of P , with the property that if J(i) ⊆ J(j), then i ≤ j. Let

It follows that the inclusions K(i − 1) ⊆ K(i) are inner anodyne. Therefore the composite inclusion K =
K(0) ⊆ K(m) = ∆n is also inner anodyne.

Proposition 4.4.5.6. The inclusion Ret ⊆ Idem+ is an inner anodyne map of simplicial sets.

Proof. Let Retm ⊆ Idem+ be the simplicial subset deﬁned so that (J0, ∼) : ∆J → Idem+ factors through
Retm if and only if the quotient J0/ ∼ has cardinality ≤ m. We observe that there is a pushout diagram

where K ⊆ ∆2m denote the simplicial subset spanned by those faces which do not contain ∆{1,3,...,2m−1}.
If m ≥ 2, Lemma 4.4.5.5 implies that the upper horizontal arrow is inner anodyne, so that the inclusion
Retm−1 ⊆ Retm is inner anodyne. The inclusion Ret ⊆ Idem+ can be identiﬁed with an inﬁnite composition

Ret = Ret1 ⊆ Ret2 ⊆ . . .

of inner anodyne maps, and is therefore inner anodyne.

Corollary 4.4.5.7. Let C be an ∞-category. Then the restriction map

Fun(Idem+, C) → Fun(Ret, C)

from strong retraction diagrams to weak retraction diagrams is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets.
particular, every weak retraction diagram in C can be extended to a strong retraction diagram.

In

We now study the relationship between strong retraction diagrams and idempotents in an ∞-category C.

We will need the following lemma, whose proof is somewhat tedious.

Proof. Suppose given 0 < i < n and a map Λn
{(Jk, ∼k)}k6=i, where Jk ⊆ {0, . . . , k−1, k+1, . . . , n} and ∼k is an equivalence relation Jk deﬁning an element
of HomSet∆(∆{0,...,k−1,k+1,...,n}, Idem+). Let J =
Jk, and deﬁne a relation ∼ on J as follows: if a, b ∈ J,
then a ∼ b if and only if either

(∃k 6= i)[(a, b ∈ Jk) ∧ (a ∼k b)]

S

or

(a 6= b 6= i 6= a) ∧ (∃c ∈ Ja ∩ Jb)[(a ∼b c) ∧ (b ∼a c)].

We must prove two things:
{0, . . . , k − 1, k + 1, . . . , n} coincides with (Jk, ∼k) for k 6= i.

that (J, ∼) ∈ HomSet∆ (∆n, Idem+), and that the restriction of (J, ∼) to

We ﬁrst check that ∼ is an equivalence relation. It is obvious that ∼ is reﬂexive and symmetric. Suppose

that a ∼ b and that b ∼ c; we wish to prove that a ∼ c. There are several cases to consider:

• Suppose that there exists j 6= i, k 6= i such that a, b ∈ Jj, b, c ∈ Jk, and a ∼j b ∼k c. If a 6= k, then
also a ∈ Jk and a ∼k b, and we may conclude that a ∼ c by invoking the transitivity of ∼k. Therefore
we may suppose that a = k. By the same argument, we may suppose that b = j; we therefore conclude
that a ∼ c.

• Suppose that there exists k 6= i with a, b ∈ Jk, that b 6= c 6= i 6= b and there exists d ∈ Jb ∩ Jc with
a ∼k b ∼c d ∼b c. If a = b or a = c there is nothing to prove; assume therefore that a 6= b and a 6= c.
Then a ∈ Jc and a ∼c b, so by transitivity a ∼c d. Similarly, a ∈ Jb and a ∼b d so that a ∼b c by
transitivity.

• Suppose that a 6= b 6= i 6= a, b 6= c 6= i 6= b, and that there exist d ∈ Ja ∩ Jb and e ∈ Jb ∩ Jc such
that a ∼b d ∼a b ∼c e ∼b c. It will suﬃce to prove that a ∼b c. If c = d, this is clear; let us therefore
assume that c 6= d. By transitivity, it suﬃces to show that d ∼b e. Since c 6= d, we have d ∈ Jc and
d ∼c b, so that d ∼c e by transitivity, and therefore d ∼b e.

To complete the proof that (J, ∼) belongs to HomSet∆ (∆n, Idem+), we must show that if a < b < c,
a ∈ J, c ∈ J, and a ∼ c, then also b ∈ J and a ∼ b ∼ c. There are two cases to consider. Suppose ﬁrst that
there exists k 6= j such that a, c ∈ Jk and a ∼k c. These relations hold for any k /∈ {i, a, c}. If it is possible
to choose k 6= b, then we conclude that b ∈ Jk and a ∼k b ∼k c as desired. Otherwise, we may suppose that
the choices k = 0 and k = n are impossible, so that a = 0 and c = n. Then a < i < c, so that i ∈ Jb and
a ∼b i ∼b c. Without loss of generality we may suppose b < i. Then a ∼c i, so that b ∈ Jc and a ∼c b ∼c i
as desired.

We now claim that (J, ∼) : ∆n → Idem+ is an extension of the original map Λn

i → Idem+. In other
words, we claim that for k 6= i, Jk = J ∩ {0, . . . , k − 1, k + 1, . . . , n} and ∼k is the restriction of ∼ to Jk. The
ﬁrst claim is obvious. For the second, let us suppose that a, b ∈ Jk and a ∼ b. We wish to prove that a ∼k b.
It will suﬃce to prove that a ∼j b for any j /∈ {i, a, b}. Since a ∼ b, either such a j exists, or a 6= b 6= i 6= a
and there exists c ∈ Ja ∩ Jb such that a ∼b c ∼a b. If there exists j /∈ {a, b, c, i}, then we conclude that
a ∼j c ∼j b and hence a ∼j b by transitivity. Otherwise, we conclude that c = k 6= i and that 0, n ∈ {a, b, c}.
Without loss of generality, i < c; thus 0 ∈ {a, b} and we may suppose without loss of generality that a < i.
Since a ∼b c, we conclude that i ∈ Jb and a ∼b i ∼b c. Consequently, i ∈ Ja and i ∼a c ∼a b, so that i ∼a b
by transitivity and therefore i ∼c b. We now have a ∼c i ∼c b so that a ∼c b as desired.

Remark 4.4.5.9. It is clear that Idem ⊆ Idem+ is the full simplicial subset spanned by the vertex x, and
therefore an ∞-category as well.

According to Corollary 4.4.5.7, every weak retraction diagram

in an ∞-category C can be extended to a strong retraction diagram F : Idem+ → C, which restricts to give
an idempotent in C. Our next goal is to show that F is canonically determined by the restriction F | Idem.
Our next result expresses the idea that if an idempotent in C arises in this manner, then F is essentially

unique.

Lemma 4.4.5.10. The ∞-category Idem is weakly contractible.

Proof. An explicit computation shows that the topological space | Idem | is connected, simply connected, and
has vanishing homology in degrees greater than zero. (Alternatively, we can deduce this from Proposition
4.4.5.15 below.)

Lemma 4.4.5.11. The inclusion Idem ⊆ Idem+ is a coﬁnal map of simplicial sets.

Proof. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it will suﬃce to prove that the simplicial sets Idemx/ and Idemy/ are
weakly contractible. The simplicial set Idemx/ is an ∞-category with an initial object, and therefore weakly
contractible. The projection Idemy/ → Idem is an isomorphism, and Idem is weakly contractible by Lemma
4.4.5.10.

Proposition 4.4.5.12. Let C be an ∞-category, and let F : Idem+ → C be a strong retraction diagram.
Then F is a left Kan extension of F | Idem.

Remark 4.4.5.13. Passing to opposite ∞-categories, it follows that a strong retraction diagram F :
Idem+ → C is also a right Kan extension of F | Idem.

Proof. We must show that the induced map

is a colimit diagram. Consider the commutative diagram

(Idem/y)⊲ → (Idem+

/y)⊲ G→ Idem+ F→ C

Idem/y

Idem+
/y

Idem

/ Idem+ .

The lower horizontal map is coﬁnal by Lemma 4.4.5.11, and the vertical maps are isomorphisms: therefore
the upper horizontal map is also coﬁnal. Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that F ◦ G is a colimit diagram,
which is obvious.

We will say that an idempotent F : Idem → C in an ∞-category C is eﬀective if it extends to a map
Idem+ → C. According to Lemma 4.3.2.13, F is eﬀective if and only if it has a colimit in C. We will say
that C is idempotent complete if every idempotent in C is eﬀective.

Corollary 4.4.5.14. Let C be an ∞-category, and let D ⊆ Fun(Idem, C) be the full subcategory spanned by
the eﬀective idempotents in C. The restriction map Fun(Idem+, C) → D is a trivial ﬁbration. In particular,
if C is idempotent complete, then we have a diagram

Fun(Ret, C) ← Fun(Idem+, C) → Fun(Idem, C)

of trivial ﬁbrations.

Proof. Combine Proposition 4.4.5.12 with Proposition 4.3.2.15.

By deﬁnition, an ∞-category C is idempotent complete if and only if every idempotent Idem → C has a
colimit. In particular, if C admits all small colimits, then it is idempotent complete. As we noted above, this
is not necessarily true if C admits only ﬁnite colimits. However, it turns out that ﬁltered colimits do suﬃce:
this assertion is not entirely obvious, since the ∞-category Idem itself is not ﬁltered.

Proposition 4.4.5.15. Let A be a linearly ordered set with no largest element. Then there exists a coﬁnal
map p : N(A) → Idem.

Proof. Let p : N(A) → Idem be the unique map which carries nondegenerate simplices to nondegenerate
simplices. Explicitly, this map carries a simplex ∆J → N(A) corresponding to a map s : J → A of linearly
ordered sets to the equivalence relation (i ∼ j) ⇔ (s(i) = s(j)). We claim that p is coﬁnal. According to
Theorem 4.1.3.1, it will suﬃce to show that the ﬁber product N(A) ×Idem Idemx/ is weakly contractible.
We observe that N(A) ×Idem Idemx ≃ N(A′), where A′ denote the set A × {0, 1} equipped with the partial
ordering

(α, i) < (α′, j) ⇔ (j = 1) ∧ (α < α′).

For each α ∈ A, let A<α = {α′ ∈ A : α′ < α} and let

A′

α = {(α′, i) ∈ A′ : (α′ < α) ∨ ((α′, i) = (α, 1))}.

By hypothesis, we can write A as a ﬁltered union

observe that this linearly ordered set is κ-ﬁltered).

Presentable and Accessible
∞-Categories

Many categories which arise naturally, such as the category A of abelian groups, are large: they have a
proper class of objects, even when the objects are considered only up to isomorphism. However, though A
itself is large, it is in some sense determined by the much smaller category A0 of ﬁnitely generated abelian
groups: A is naturally equivalent to the category of Ind-objects of A0. This remark carries more than simply
philosophical signiﬁcance. When properly exploited, it can be used to prove statements such as the following:

Proposition 5.0.0.1. Let F : A → Set be a contravariant functor from A to the category of sets. Then F
is representable by an object of A if and only if it carries colimits in A to limits in Set.

Proposition 5.0.0.1 is valid not only for the category A of abelian groups, but for any presentable cat-
egory: that is, any category which possess all (small) colimits and satisﬁes mild set-theoretic assumptions
(such categories are referred to as locally presentable in [1]). Our goal in this chapter is to develop an ∞-
categorical generalization of the theory of presentable categories, and to obtain higher-categorical analogues
of Proposition 5.0.0.1 and related results (such as the adjoint functor theorem).

The most basic example of a presentable ∞-category is the ∞-category S of spaces. More generally, we
can deﬁne an ∞-category P(C) of presheaves (of spaces) on an arbitrary small ∞-category C. We will study
the properties of P(C) in §5.1; in particular, we will see that there exists a Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C)
which is fully faithful, just as in ordinary category theory. Moreover, we give a characterization of P(C) in
terms of C: it is, in some sense, freely generated by the essential image of j under (small) colimits.

The presheaf ∞-categories P(C) are all presentable. Conversely, any presentable ∞-category can be
obtained as a localization of some presheaf ∞-category P(C) (Proposition 5.5.1.1). To make sense of this
statement, we need a theory of localizations of ∞-categories. We will develop such a theory in §5.2, as part
of a more general theory of adjoint functors between ∞-categories.

In §5.3 we will introduce, for every small ∞-category C, an ∞-category Ind(C) of Ind-objects of C.
Roughly speaking, this is an ∞-category which is obtained from C by freely adjoining colimits for all ﬁltered
diagrams. It is characterized up to equivalence by the fact that Ind(C) contains a full subcategory equivalent
to C, which generates Ind(C) under ﬁltered colimits and consists of compact objects.

The construction of Ind-categories will be applied in §5.4 to the study of accessible ∞-categories. Roughly
speaking, an ∞-category C is accessible if it is generated under (suﬃciently) ﬁltered colimits by a small
subcategory C0 ⊆ C. We will prove that the class of accessible ∞-categories is stable under a various
categorical constructions. Results of this type will play an important technical role later this book: they
generally allow us to dispense with the set-theoretic aspects of an argument (such as cardinality estimation),
and to focus instead on the more conceptual aspects.

We will say that an ∞-category C is presentable if C is accessible and admits (small) colimits. In §5.5, we
will describe the theory of presentable ∞-categories in detail. In particular, we will generalize Proposition

254

5.0.0.1 to the ∞-categorical setting, and prove an analogue of the adjoint functor theorem. We will also
study localizations of presentable ∞-categories, following ideas of Bousﬁeld. The theory of presentable
∞-categories will play a vital role in the study of ∞-topoi, which is the subject of the next chapter.

255

5.1 ∞-Categories of Presheaves

The category of sets plays a central role in classical category theory. The primary reason for this is Yoneda’s
lemma, which asserts that for any category C, the “Yoneda embedding”

j : C → SetCop

C 7→ HomC(•, C)

is fully faithful. Consequently, objects in C can be thought of as a kind of “generalized sets”, and various
questions about the category C can be reduced to questions about the category of sets.

If C is an ∞-category, then the mapping sets of the above discussion should be replaced by mapping
spaces. Consequently, one should expect the Yoneda embedding to take values in presheaves of spaces,
rather than presheaves of sets. To formalize this, we introduce the following notation:

Deﬁnition 5.1.0.1. Let S be a simplicial set. We let P(S) denote the simplicial set Fun(Sop, S); here S
denotes the ∞-category of spaces deﬁned in §1.2.16. We will refer to P(S) as the ∞-category of presheaves
on S.

Remark 5.1.0.2. More generally, for any ∞-category C, we might refer to Fun(Sop, C) as the ∞-category
of C-valued presheaves on S. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the word “presheaf” will always refer to a S-valued
presheaf. This is somewhat nonstandard terminology: one usually understands the term “presheaf” to refer
to a presheaf of sets, rather than a presheaf of spaces. The shift in terminology is justiﬁed by the fact that
the important role of Set in ordinary category theory is taken on by S in the ∞-categorical setting.

Our goal in this section is to establish the basic properties of P(S). We begin in §5.1.1 by reviewing
two other possible deﬁnitions of P(S): one via the theory of right ﬁbrations over S, another via simplicial
presheaves on the category C[S]. Using the “straightening” results of §2.2.3 and §4.2.4, we will show that all
three of these deﬁnitions are equivalent.

The presheaf ∞-categories P(S) are examples of presentable ∞-categories (see §5.5). In particular, each
P(S) admits small limits and colimits. We will give a proof of this assertion in §5.1.2, by reducing to the
case where S is a point.

The main question regarding the ∞-category P(S) is how it relates to the original simplicial set S. In
§5.1.3 we will construct a map j : S → P(S), which is an ∞-categorical analogue of the usual Yoneda
embedding. Just as in classical category theory, the Yoneda embedding is fully faithful. In particular, we
note that any ∞-category C can be embedded in a larger ∞-category which admits limits and colimits; this
observation allows us to construct an idempotent completion of C, which we will study in §5.1.4.

In §5.1.5, we will characterize the ∞-category P(S) in terms of the Yoneda embedding j : S → P(S).
Roughly speaking, we will show that P(S) is freely generated by S under colimits (Theorem 5.1.5.6). In
particular, if C is a category which admits colimits, then any diagram f : S → C extends uniquely (up to
homotopy) to a functor F : P(S) → C. In §5.1.6, we will give a criterion for determining whether or not F
is an equivalence.

5.1.1 Other Models for P(S)
Let S be a simplicial set. We have deﬁned the ∞-category P(S) of presheaves on S to be the mapping space
Fun(Sop, S). However, there are several equivalent models which would serve equally well; we discuss two of
them in this section.

Let P′

∆(S) denote the full subcategory of (Set∆)/S spanned by the right ﬁbrations X → S. We deﬁne
P′(S) to be the simplicial nerve N(P′
∆(S) is a ﬁbrant simplicial category, P′(S) is an
∞-category. We will see in a moment that P′(S) is (naturally) equivalent to P(S). In order to do this, we
need to introduce a third model.

with the projective model structure deﬁned in §A.3.3. With respect to this structure, SetC
∆(φ) = (SetC

objects, and we deﬁne P′′(φ) to be the simplicial nerve N(P′′

∆ is a simplicial
∆)◦ denote the full simplicial subcategory consisting of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant

∆(φ)).

We are now ready to describe the relationship between these diﬀerent models:

Proposition 5.1.1.1. Let S be a simplicial set, and let φ : C[S]op → C be an equivalence of simplicial
categories. Then there are (canonical) equivalences of ∞-categories

P(S)

f
← P′′(φ)

g
→ P′(S).

Proof. The map f was constructed in Proposition 4.2.4.4; it therefore suﬃces to give a construction of g.

Recall that the category (Set∆)/S of simplicial sets over S is endowed model structure, the contravariant
model structure deﬁned in §2.1.4. Moreover, this model structure is simplicial (Proposition 2.1.4.8) and the
ﬁbrant objects are precisely the right ﬁbrations over S (Corollary 2.2.3.12). Thus, we may identify P′
∆(S)
with the simplicial category (Set∆)◦

/S of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects of (Set∆)/S.
According to Theorem 2.2.1.2, the straightening and unstraightening functors (Stφ, U nφ) determine a
Quillen equivalence between (Set∆)C and (Set∆)/S. Moreover, for any X ∈ (Set∆)/S and any simplicial set
K, there is a natural chain of equivalences

Stφ(X × K) → (StφX) ⊗ |K|Q• → (StφX) ⊗ K.

(The fact that the ﬁrst map is an equivalence follows easily from Proposition 3.2.1.13.) It follows from Propo-
sition A.3.1.10 that U nφ is endowed with the structure of a simplicial functor, and induces an equivalence
of simplicial categories

(SetC

∆)◦ → (Set∆)◦

/S.

We obtain the desired equivalence g by passing to the simplicial nerve.

5.1.2 Colimits in ∞-Categories of Functors

Let S be an arbitrary simplicial set. Our goal in this section is to prove that the ∞-category P(S) of
presheaves on S admits small limits and colimits. There are (at least) three approaches to proving this:

(1) According to Proposition 5.1.1.1, we may identify P(S) with the ∞-category underlying the simplicial
. We can then deduce the existence of limits and colimits in P(S) by invoking

model category Set
Corollary 4.2.4.8.

C[S]op
∆

(2) Since the ∞-category S classiﬁes left ﬁbrations, the ∞-category P(S) classiﬁes left ﬁbrations over Sop:
in other words, homotopy classes of maps K → P(S) can be identiﬁed with equivalence classes of
left ﬁbrations X → K × Sop. It is possible to generalize Proposition 3.3.4.5 and Corollary 3.3.3.3 to
describe limits and colimits in P(S) entirely in the language of left ﬁbrations. The existence problem
can then be solved by exhibiting explicit constructions of left ﬁbrations.

(3) Applying either (1) or (2) in the case where S is a point, we can deduce that the ∞-category S ≃ P(∗)
admits limits and colimits. We can then attempt to deduce the same result for P(S) = Fun(Sop, S)
using a general result about (co)limits in functor categories (Proposition 5.1.2.2).

Although approach (1) is probably the quickest, we will adopt approach (3) because it gives additional
information: our proof will show that the formation of limits and colimits in P(S) are computed pointwise.
The same proof will also apply to ∞-categories of C-valued presheaves in the case where C is not necessarily
the ∞-category S of spaces.

Lemma 5.1.2.1. Let q : Y → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, and let C = MapS(S, Y ) denote
the ∞-category of sections of q. Let p : S → Y be an object of C having the property that p(s) is an initial
object of the ﬁber Ys for each vertex s of S. Then p is an initial object of C.

257

Proof. By Proposition 4.2.2.4, the map Y pS / → S is a Cartesian ﬁbration. By hypothesis, for each vertex
s of S, the map Y pS / ×S {s} → Ys is a trivial ﬁbration. It follows that the projection Y pS / → Y is an
equivalence of Cartesian ﬁbrations over S, and therefore a categorical equivalence; taking sections over S we
obtain another categorical equivalence

MapS(S, Y pS /) → MapS(Y, S).

But this map is just the left ﬁbration j : Cp/ → C; it follows that j is a categorical equivalence. Applying
Propostion 3.3.1.5 to the diagram

we deduce that j induces categorical equivalences Cp/ ×C{t} → {t} for each vertex t of Q. Thus the ﬁbers
of j are contractible Kan complexes, so that j is a trivial ﬁbration (by Lemma 2.1.3.4) and p is an initial
object of C, as desired.

Proposition 5.1.2.2. Let K be a simplicial set, q : X → S a Cartesian ﬁbration, and p : K → MapS(S, X)
a diagram. For each vertex s of S, we let ps : K → Xs be the induced map. Suppose, furthermore, that each
ps has a colimit in the ∞-category Xs. Then:

(1) There exists a map p : K ⋄ ∆0 → MapS(S, X) which extends p and induces a colimit diagram p :

K ⋄ ∆0 → Xs, for each vertex s ∈ S.

(2) An arbitrary extension p : K ⋄∆0 → MapS(S, X) of p is a colimit for p if and only if each ps : K ⋄∆0 →

Xs is a colimit for ps.

Proof. Choose a factorization K → K ′ → MapS(S, X) of p, where K → K ′ is inner anodyne (and therefore a
categorical equivalence) and K ′ → CS is an inner ﬁbration (so that K ′ is an ∞-category). The map K → K ′
is a categorical equivalence, and therefore coﬁnal. We are free to replace K by K ′, and may thereby assume
that K is an ∞-category.

We apply Proposition 4.2.2.7 to the Cartesian ﬁbration X → S and the diagram pS : K × S → X

determined by the map p. We deduce that there exists a map

pS : (K × S) ⋄S S = (K ⋄ ∆0) × S → X

having the property that its restriction to the ﬁber over each s ∈ S is a colimit of ps; this proves (1).

The “if” direction of (2) follows immediately from Lemma 5.1.2.1. The “only if” follows from (1) and

the fact that colimits, when they exist, are unique up to equivalence.

Corollary 5.1.2.3. Let K and S be simplicial sets, and let C be an ∞-category which admits K-indexed
colimits. Then:

(1) The ∞-category Fun(S, C) admits K-indexed colimits.

(2) A map K ⊲ → Fun(S, C) is a colimit diagram if and only if, for each vertex s ∈ S, the induced map

K ⊲ → C is a colimit diagram.

Proof. Apply Proposition 5.1.2.2 to the projection C ×S → S.

Corollary 5.1.2.4. Let S be a simplicial set. The ∞-category P(S) of presheaves on S admits all small
limits and colimits.

5.1.3 Yoneda’s Lemma

In this section, we will construct the ∞-categorical analogue of the Yoneda embedding, and prove that it is
fully faithful. We begin with a somewhat naive approach, based on the formalism of simplicial categories.
We note that an analogoue of Yoneda’s Lemma is valid in enriched category theory (with the usual proof).
Namely, suppose that C is a category enriched over another category E. Then there is an “enriched Yoneda
embedding”

i : C → ECop

X 7→ MapC(•, X).

Consequently, for any simplicial category C, one obtains a fully faithful embedding i of C into the simplicial
category MapCat∆ (Cop, Set∆) of simplicial functors from Cop into Set∆. In fact, i is fully faithful in the strong
sense that it induces isomorphisms of simplicial sets

MapC(X, Y ) → MapSetCop

∆

(i(X), i(Y )),

rather than merely weak homotopy equivalences. Unfortunately, this assertion does not necessarily have
any ∞-categorical content, because the simplicial category SetCop
∆ does not generally represent the correct
∞-category of functors from Cop to Set∆.

Let us describe an analogous construction in the setting of ∞-categories. Let K be a simplicial set, and

let C = C[K]. Then C is a simplicial category, so

(X, Y ) 7→ Sing | HomC(X, Y )|

determines a simplicial functor from Cop × C to the category Kan. The functor C does not commute with
products, but there exists a natural map C[K op × K] → Cop × C. Composing with this map, we obtain a
map of simplicial sets

C[K op × K] → Kan .

Passing to the adjoint, we obtain a map of simplicial sets K op × K → S, which we can identify with

j : K → Fun(K op, S) = P(K).

We shall refer to j (or, more generally, any map equivalent to j) as the Yoneda embedding.

Proposition 5.1.3.1 (∞-Categorical Yoneda Lemma). Let K be a simplicial set. Then the Yoneda embed-
ding j : K → P(K) is fully faithful.

Proof. Let C′ = Sing | C[K op]| be the “ﬁbrant replacement” for C = C[K op]. We endow SetC′
projective model structure described in §A.3.3.

∆ with the

We note that the Yoneda embedding factors as a composition

K

j′
→ N((SetC′

∆ )◦)

j′′
→ Fun(K op, S),

where j′′ is the map of Proposition 4.2.4.4 and consequently a categorical equivalence. It therefore suﬃces
to prove that j′ is fully faithful. For this, we need only show that the adjoint map

J : C[K] → SetC′
∆ .

is a fully-faithful functor between simplicial categories. We now observe that J is the composition of an
equivalence C[K] → (C′)op with the (simplicial enriched) Yoneda embedding (C′)op → SetC′
∆ , which is fully
faithful in virtue of the classical (simplicially enriched) version of Yoneda’s Lemma.

We conclude by establishing another pleasant property of the Yoneda embedding:

259

Proposition 5.1.3.2. Let C be a small ∞-category, and j : C → P(C) the Yoneda embedding. Then j
preserves all limits which exist in C.

Proof. Let p : K → C be a diagram having a limit in C. We wish to show that j carries any limit for p to a
limit of j ◦ p. Choose a category I and a coﬁnal map N (Iop) → K op (the existence of which is guaranteed
by Proposition 4.2.3.14) Replacing K by N(I), we may suppose that K is the nerve of a category. Let
p : N(I)⊳ → C be a limit for p.

We recall the deﬁnition of the Yoneda embedding. It involves the choice of an equivalence C[C] → D,
where D is a ﬁbrant simplicial category. For deﬁniteness, we took D to be Sing | C[C]|. However, we could just
as well choose some other ﬁbrant simplicial category D′ equivalent to C[C] and obtain a “modiﬁed Yoneda
embedding” j′ : C → P(C); it is easy to see that j′ and j are equivalent functors, so it suﬃces to show that j′
preserves the limit of p. Using Corollary 4.2.4.7, we may suppose that p is obtained from a functor between
simplicial categories q : {x} ⋆ I → D by passing to the nerve. According to Theorem 4.2.4.1, q is a homotopy
limit of q = q| I. Consequently, for each object Z ∈ D, the induced functor

is a homotopy limit of qZ = qZ | I. Taking Z to be the image of an object C of C, we deduce that

qZ : I 7→ HomD(Z, q(I))

N(I)⊳ → C j′

→ P(C) → S

is a limit for its restriction to N(I), where the map on the right is given by “evaluation at C”. Proposition
5.1.2.2 now implies that j′ ◦ p is a limit for j′ ◦ p, as desired.

5.1.4 Idempotent Completions

Recall that an ∞-category C is said to be idempotent complete if every functor Idem → C admits a colimit in
C (see §4.4.5). If an ∞-category C is not idempotent complete, then we can attempt to correct the situation
by passing to a larger ∞-category.

Deﬁnition 5.1.4.1. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories. We will say that f exhibits D as
an idempotent completion of C if D is idempotent complete, f is fully faithful, and every object of D is a
retract of f (C), for some object C ∈ C.

Our goal in this section is to show that ∞-category C has an idempotent completion D, which is unique
up to equivalence. The uniqueness is a consequence of Proposition 5.1.4.9, proven below. The existence
question is much easier to address.

Proposition 5.1.4.2. Let C be an ∞-category. Then C admits an idempotent completion.

Proof. Enlarging the universe if necessary, we may suppose that C is small. Let C′ denote the full subcategory
of P(C) spanned by those objects which are retracts of objects which belong to the image of the Yoneda
embedding j : C → P(C). Then C′ is stable under retracts in P(C). Since P(C) admits all small colimits,
It follows that C′ is idempotent complete.
Corollary 4.4.5.16 implies that P(C) is idempotent complete.
Proposition 5.1.3.1 implies that the Yoneda embedding j : C → C′ is fully faithful, and therefore exhibits C′
as an idempotent completion of C.

We now address the question of uniqueness for idempotent completions. First, we need a few preliminary

results.

Lemma 5.1.4.3. Let C be an ∞-category which is idempotent complete, and let p : K → C be a diagram.
Then C/p and Cp/ are also idempotent complete.

260

Proof. By symmetry, it will suﬃce to prove that C/p is idempotent complete. Let q : C/p → C be the
associated right ﬁbration, and let F : Idem → C/p be an idempotent. We will show that F has a limit. Since
C is idempotent complete, q ◦ F has a limit q ◦ F : Idem⊳ → C. Consider the lifting problem

Idem(cid:127)

C .

The right vertical map is a right ﬁbration, and the left vertical map is right anodyne (Lemma 4.2.3.6), so
that there exists a dotted arrow F as indicated. Using Proposition 4.4.2.9, we deduce that F is a limit of
F .

Lemma 5.1.4.4. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories which exhibits D as an idempotent
completion of C, and let p : K → D be a diagram. Then the induced map f/p : C ×D D/p → D/p exhibits
D/p as an idempotent completion of C ×D D/p.

Proof. Lemma 5.1.4.3 asserts that D/p is idempotent complete. We must show that every object D ∈ D/p
is a retract of f/p(C), for some C ∈ C ×D D/p. Let q : D/p → D be the projection, and let D = q(D). Since
f exhibits D as an idempotent completion of C, there is a diagram

f (C)

in D, where g is an equivalence. Since q is a right ﬁbration, we can lift this to a diagram

in D/q. Since g is q-Cartesian and g is an equivalence, g is ann equivalence. It follows that D is a retract of
f (C). By construction, f (C) = f/p(C) for an appropriately chosen object C ∈ C ×D D/p.

Lemma 5.1.4.5. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories which exhibits D as an idempotent
completion of C. Suppose that D has an initial object ∅. Then C is weakly contractible as a simplicial set.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that C is a full subcategory of D and that f is the
inclusion. Since f exhibits D as an idempotent completion of C, the initial object ∅ of D admits a map
f : C → ∅, where C ∈ C. The ∞-category CC/ has an initial object, and is therefore weakly contractible.
Since composition

Cf / → CC/ → C
is both a weak homotopy equivalence (in fact, a trivial ﬁbration) and weakly nullhomotopic, we conclude
that C is weakly contractible.

Lemma 5.1.4.6. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories which exhibits D as an idempotent
completion of C. Then f is coﬁnal.

Proof. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it suﬃces to prove that for every object D ∈ D, simplicial set C ×D DD/
is weakly contractible. Lemma 5.1.4.4 asserts that fD/ is also an idempotent completion, and Lemma 5.1.4.5
completes the proof.

Lemma 5.1.4.7. Let F : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories, and let C0 ⊆ C be a full subcategory
such that the inclusion exhibits C as an idempotent completion of C0. Then F is a left Kan extension of
F | C0.

Proof. We must show that for every object C ∈ C, the composite map

(C0

/C )⊲ → (C/C )⊲ G→ C F→ D

is a colimit diagram in D. Lemma 5.1.4.4 guarantees that C0
/C ⊆ C/C is an idempotent completion, and
therefore coﬁnal by Lemma 5.1.4.6. Consequently, it suﬃces prove that F ◦ G is a colimit diagram, which is
obvious.

Lemma 5.1.4.8. Let C and D be ∞-categories which are idempotent complete, and let C0 ⊆ C be a full
subcategory such that the inclusion exhibits C as an idempotent completion of C0. Then any functor F0 :
C0 → D has an extension F : C → D.

Proof. We will suppose that the ∞-categories C and D are small. Let P(D) be the ∞-category of presheaves
on D (see §5.1), j : D → P(D) the Yoneda embedding, and D′ the essential image of j. According to
Proposition A.2.3.1, it will suﬃce to prove that j ◦ F0 can be extended to a functor F ′ : C → D′. Since P(D)
admits small colimits, we can choose F ′ : C → P(D) to be a left Kan extension of j ◦ F0. Every object of C
is a retract of an object of C0, so that every object in the essential image of F ′ is a retract of the Yoneda
image of an object of D. Since D is idempotent complete, it follows that the F ′ factors through D′.

Proposition 5.1.4.9. Let f : C → D be a functor which exhibits D as the idempotent completion of C, and
let E be an ∞-category which is idempotent complete. Then composition with f induces an equivalence of
∞-categories f ∗ : Fun(D, E) → Fun(C, E).

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that f is the inclusion of a full subcategory. In this case,
we combine Lemmas 5.1.4.7, 5.1.4.8, and Proposition 4.3.2.15 to deduce that f ∗ is a trivial ﬁbration.

Remark 5.1.4.10. Let C be a small ∞-category, and let f : C → C′ be an idempotent completion of C. The
proof of Proposition 5.1.4.2 shows that C′ is equivalent to a full subcategory of P(C), and therefore locally
small (see §5.4.1). Moreover, every object of hC′ is the image of some retraction map in hC; it follows that
the set of equivalence classes of objects in C′ is bounded in size. It follows that C′ is essentially small.

5.1.5 The Universal Property of P(S)
Let S be a (small) simplicial set. We have deﬁned P(S) to be the ∞-category of maps from Sop into the ∞-
category S of spaces. Informally, we may view P(S) as the limit of a diagram in the ∞-bicategory of (large)
∞-categories: namely, the constant diagram carrying Sop to S. In more concrete terms, our deﬁnition of P(S)
leads immediately to a characaterization of P(S) by a universal mapping property: for every ∞-category C,
there is an equivalence of ∞-categories (in fact an isomorphism of simplicial sets)

Fun(C, P(S)) ≃ Fun(C ×Sop, S).

The goal of this section is to give a dual characterization of P(S):
it may also be viewed as a colimit of
copies of S, indexed by S. However, this colimit needs to be understood in an appropriate ∞-bicategory of
∞-categories where the morphisms are given by colimit preserving functors. In other words, we will show
that P(S) is in some sense “freely generated” by S under small colimits (Theorem 5.1.5.6). First, we need
to introduce a bit of notation.

Notation 5.1.5.1. Let C be an ∞-category and S a simplicial set. We will let FunL(P(S), C) denote the
full subcategory of Fun(P(S), C) spanned by those functors P(S) → C which preserve small colimits.

The motivation for this notation is as follows: in §5.2.6, we will use the notation FunL(D, C) to denote
the full subcategory of Fun(D, C) spanned by those functors which are left adjoints. In §5.5.2, we will see

262

that when D = P(S) (or, more generally, when D is presentable), then a functor D → C is a left adjoint if
and only if it preserves small colimits (see Corollary 5.5.2.9 and Remark 5.5.2.10).

We wish to prove that if C is an ∞-category which admits small colimits, then any map S → C extends
in an essentially unique fashion to a colimit-preserving functor P(S) → C. To prove this, we need a second
characterization of the colimit-preserving functors f : P(S) → C: they are precisely those functors which are
left Kan extensions of their restriction to the essential image of the Yoneda embedding.

Lemma 5.1.5.2. Let S be a small simplicial set, let s be a vertex of S, let e : P(S) → S be the map given by
evaluation at s, and let f : C → P(S) be the associated left ﬁbration (see §3.3.2). Then f is corepresentable
by the object j(s) ∈ P(S), where j : S → P(S) denotes the Yoneda embedding.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that S is an ∞-category. We make use of the equivalent
model P′(S) of §5.1.1. Observe that the functor f : P(S) → S is equivalent to f ′ : P′(S) → S, where f ′ is
the nerve of the simplicial functor P′
∆(S) → Kan which associates to each left ﬁbration Y → S the ﬁber
Ys = Y ×S {s}. Furthermore, under the equivalence of P(S) with P′(S), the object j(s) corresponds to a
left ﬁbration X(s) → S which is corepresented by s. Then X(s) contains an initial object x lying over s.
The choice of x determines a point η ∈ π0f ′(X(s)). According to Proposition 4.4.4.5, to show that X(s)
corepresents f ′, it suﬃces to show that for every left ﬁbration X → S, the map

MapS(X(s), Y ) → Ys,

given by evaluation at x, is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes. We may rewrite the space on the right
hand side as MapS({x}, Y ). According to Proposition 2.1.4.8, the covariant model structure on (Set∆)/S
is compatible with the simplicial structure. It therefore suﬃces to prove that the inclusion i : {x} ⊆ X(s)
is a covariant equivalence. But this is clear, since i is the inclusion of an initial object and therefore left
anodyne.

Lemma 5.1.5.3. Let S be a small simplicial set, and let j : S → P(S) denote the Yoneda embedding. Then
idP(S) is a left Kan extension of j along itself.

Proof. Let C ⊆ P(S) denote the essential image of j. According to Proposition 5.1.3.1, j induces an equiva-
lence S → C. It therefore suﬃces to prove that idP(S) is a left Kan extension of its restriction to C. Let X
be an object of P(S); we must show that the natural map

φ : C⊲

/X ⊆ P(S)⊲

/X → P(S)

is a colimit diagram.

According to Proposition 5.1.2.2, it will suﬃce to prove that for each vertex s of S, the map

φs : C⊲

/X → S

given by composing φ with the evaluation map is a colimit diagram in S. Let D → C⊲
/X be the pullback
of the universal left ﬁbration along φs, and let D0 ⊆ D be the preimage in D of C/X ⊆ C⊲
/X . According
to Proposition 3.3.4.5, it will suﬃce to prove that the inclusion D0 ⊆ D is a weak homotopy equivalence of
simplicial sets.

Let C = j(s). Let E = C⊲

/X ×P(S) P(S)C/, let E0 = C/X ×C CC/ ⊆ E, and let E1 = C/X ×C{idC } ⊆ E0.

Lemma 5.1.5.2 implies that the left ﬁbrations

D → C⊲

/X ← E

are equivalent. It therefore suﬃces to show that the inclusion E0 ⊆ E is a weak homotopy equivalence. To
prove this, we observe that both E and E0 contain E1 as a deformation retract (that is, there is a retraction
r : E → E1 and a homotopy E ×∆1 → E from r to idE, so that the inclusion E1 ⊆ E is a homotopy equivalence;
the situation for E0 is similar).

be a diagram of simplicial sets. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map f is a covariant equivalence in (Set∆)/S.

(2) For every diagram p : S → C taking values in an ∞-category C, and every limit p ◦ g : B⊳ → C of p ◦ g,

the composition p ◦ g ◦ f ⊳ : A⊳ → C is a limit diagram.

(3) For every diagram p : S → S taking values in the ∞-category S of spaces, and every limit p ◦ g : B⊳ → S

of p ◦ g, the composition p ◦ g ◦ f ⊳ : A⊳ → S is a limit diagram.

Proof. The equivalence of (1) and (3) follows from Corollary 3.3.3.4 (and the deﬁnition of a contravariant
equivalence). The implication (2) ⇒ (3) is obvious. We show that (3) ⇒ (2). Let p : S → C and p ◦ g be as
in (2). Passing to a larger universe if necessary, we may suppose that C is small. For each object C ∈ C, let
jC : C → S denote the composition of the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C) with the map P(C) → S given
by evaluation at C. Combining Proposition 5.1.3.2 with Proposition 5.1.2.2, we deduce that each jC ◦ p ◦ g
is a limit diagram. Applying (3), we conclude that each jC ◦ p ◦ g ◦ f ⊳ is a limit diagram. We now apply
Propositions 5.1.3.2 and 5.1.2.2 to conclude that p ◦ g ◦ f ⊳ is a limit diagram, as desired.

Lemma 5.1.5.5. Let S be a small simplicial set, j : S → P(S) the Yoneda embedding, let C denote the
full subcategory of P(S) spanned by the objects j(s), where s is a vertex of S, and let D be an arbitrary
∞-category.

(1) Let f : P(S) → D be a functor. Then f is a left Kan extension of f | C if and only if f preserves small

colimits.

(2) Suppose that D admits small colimits, and let f0 : C → D be an arbitrary functor. There exists an

extension f : P(S) → D which is a left Kan extension of f0 = f | C.

Proof. Assertion (2) follows immediately from Lemma 4.3.2.13, since the ∞-category C/X is small for each
object X ∈ P(S). We will prove (1). Suppose ﬁrst that f preserves small colimits. We must show that for
each X ∈ P(S), the composition

C⊲

/X

δ→ P(S)

f
→ D

is a colimit diagram. Lemma 5.1.5.3 implies that δ is a colimit diagram; if f preserves small colimits, then
f ◦ δ is also a colimit diagram.

Now suppose that f is a left Kan extension of f0 = f | C. We wish to prove that f preserves small colimits.
Let K be a small simplicial set, and let p : K ⊲ → P(S) be a colimit diagram. We must show that f ◦ p is
also a colimit diagram.

Let

E = C ×Fun({0},P(S) Fun(∆1, P(S)) ×Fun({1},P(S)) K ⊲,

and let E = E ×K ⊲ K ⊆ E. We have a commutative diagram

where the vertical arrows are coCartesian ﬁbrations (Corollary 2.4.7.12). Let η : E ⋄K ⊲ K ⊲ → P(S) be the
natural map, and η = η| E ⋄KK. Proposition 4.3.3.10 implies that f ◦ η exhibits f ◦ p as a left Kan extension
of f ◦ (η| E) along q| E. Similarly, f ◦ η exhibits f ◦ p as a left Kan extension of f ◦ (η|E). It will therefore
suﬃce to prove that every colimit of f ◦ (η|E) is also a colimit of f ◦ (η| E). According to Lemma 5.1.5.4, it
suﬃces to show that the inclusion E ⊆ E is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/ C.

Since the map E → K ⊲ × C is a bivariant ﬁbration, we can apply Proposition 4.1.2.15 to deduce that the
map Eop
→ Cop is smooth. Similarly, Eop → Cop is smooth. According to Proposition 4.1.2.17, the inclusion
E ⊆ E is a contravariant equivalence if and only if, for every object C ∈ C, the inclusion of ﬁbers EC ⊆ EC is
a weak homotopy equivalence. Lemma 5.1.5.2 implies that EC → K ⊲ is equivalent to the left ﬁbration given
by the pullback of the universal left ﬁbration along the map

K ⊲ p

→ P(S) s→ S .

We now conclude by applying Proposition 3.3.4.5, noting that p is a colimit diagram by assumption and that
s preserves colimits by Proposition 5.1.2.2.

Theorem 5.1.5.6. Let S be a small simplicial set, and let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits.
Composition with the Yoneda embedding j : S → P(S) induces an equivalence of ∞-categories

Proof. Combine Corollary 4.3.2.16 with Lemma 5.1.5.5.

FunL(P(S), C) → Fun(S, C).

Deﬁnition 5.1.5.7. Let C be an ∞-category. A full subcategory C′ ⊆ C is stable under colimits if, for any
small diagram p : K → C′ which has a colimit p : K ⊲ → C in C, the map p factors through C′.

Let C be an ∞-category which admits all small colimits. Let A be a collection of objects of C. We will
say that A generates C under colimits if the following condition is satisﬁed: for any full subcategory C′ ⊆ C
containing every element of A, if C′ is stable under colimits, then C = C′.

We say that a map f : S → C generates C under colimits if the image f (S0) generates C under colimits.
Corollary 5.1.5.8. Let S be a small simplicial set. Then the Yoneda embedding j : S → P(S) generates
P(S) under small colimits.

Proof. Let C be the smallest full subcategory of P(S) which contains the essential image of j and is stable
under small colimits. Applying Theorem 5.1.5.6, we deduce that the diagram j : S → C is equivalent to
F ◦ j, for some colimit-preserving functor F : P(S) → C. We may regard F as a colimit preserving functor
from P(S) to itself. Applying Theorem 5.1.5.6 again, we deduce that F is equivalent to the identity functor
from P(S) to itself. It follows that every object of P(S) is equivalent to an object which lies in C, so that
C = P(S) as desired.

5.1.6 Complete Compactness

Let S be a small simplicial set, and f : S → C a diagram in an ∞-category C. Our goal in this section
is to analyze the following question: when is the diagram f : S → C equivalent to the Yoneda embedding
j : S → P(S)? An obvious necessary condition is that C admit small colimits (Corollary 5.1.2.4). Conversely,
if C admits small colimits, then Theorem 5.1.5.6 implies that f is equivalent to F ◦ j, where F : P(S) → C
is a colimit-preserving functor. We are now reduced to the question of deciding whether or not the functor
F is an equivalence. There are two obvious necessary conditions for this to be so: f must be fully faithful
(Proposition 5.1.3.1), and f must generate C under colimits (Corollary 5.1.5.8). We will show that the
converse holds, provided that the essential image of f consists of completely compact objects of C (see
Deﬁnition 5.1.6.2 below).

We begin by considering an arbitrary simplicial set S and a vertex s of S. Composing the Yoneda

embedding j : S → P(S) with the “evaluation map”

P(S) = Fun(Sop, S) → Fun({s}, S) ≃ S,

265

we obtain a map js : S → S. We will refer to js as the functor corepresented by s.

Remark 5.1.6.1. The above deﬁnition makes sense even when the simplicial set S is not small. However,
in this case we need to replace S (the simplicial nerve of the category of small Kan complexes) by the (very
S is the simplicial nerve of the category of all Kan complexes (not necessarily
large) ∞-category
small).

S, where

Deﬁnition 5.1.6.2. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits. We will say that an object C ∈ C
is completely compact if the functor jC : C →

S corepresented by C preserves small colimits.

The requirement that an object C of an ∞-category C be completely compact is very restrictive (see
Example 5.1.6.9 below). We introduce this notion not because it is a generally useful one, but because it is
relevant for the purpose of characterizing ∞-categories of presheaves.

b

Our ﬁrst goal is to establish that the class of completely compact objects of C is stable under retracts.

Lemma 5.1.6.3. Let C be an ∞-category, K a simplicial set, and p, q : K ⊲ → C a pair of diagrams. Suppose
q is a colimit diagram, and p is a retract of q in the ∞-category Fun(K ⊲, C). Then p is a colimit diagram.

Proof. Choose a map σ : ∆2 × K ⊲ → C such that σ|{1} × K ⊲ = q and σ|∆{0,2} × K ⊲ = p ◦ πK ⊲ . We have a
commutative diagram of simplicial sets:

Cσ/

Cσ|∆2×K/

Cσ|∆{1,2}/×K ⊲

Cσ|{2}×K ⊲/

f

f ′

Cσ|∆{1,2}×K/

/ Cσ|{2}×K/ .

We ﬁrst claim that both vertical compositions are categorical equivalences. We give the argument for

the right vertical composition; the other case is similar. We have a factorization

Cσ|∆2×K/

g′
→ Cσ|∆{0,2}×K/

g′′
→ Cσ|{2}×K/

where the g′ is a trivial ﬁbration, and g′′ admits a section s, where s is also a section of the trivial ﬁbration
C/σ|∆{0,2}×K → C/σ|{0}×K. Consequently, s and therefore also g′′ are categorical equivalences. It follows
that the map f ′ is a retract of f in the homotopy category of Set∆ (taken with respect to the Joyal model
structure).

The map f sits in a commutative diagram

Cσ|∆{1,2}/×K ⊲

f

Cσ|∆{1,2}/×K

Cq/

/ Cq/

where the vertical maps and the lower horizontal map are trivial ﬁbrations. It follows that f is a categorical
equivalence. Since f ′ is a retract of f , f ′ is also a categorical equivalence. Since f ′ is a left ﬁbration, we
deduce that f ′ is a trivial ﬁbration (Corollary 2.4.4.6), so that p is a colimit diagram as desired.

Lemma 5.1.6.4. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits. Let C and D be objects of C.
Suppose that C is completely compact, and that D is a retract of C (that is, there exist maps f : D → C and
r : C → D with r ◦ f ≃ idD. Then D is completely compact. In particular, if C and D are equivalent, then
D is completely compact.

Proof. Let j : Cop → SC denote the Yoneda embedding (for Cop). Since D is a retract of C, j(D) is a retract
of j(C). Let p : K ⊲ → C be a diagram. Then j(D) ◦ p : K ⊲ → S is a retract of j(C) ◦ p : K ⊲ → S in the
∞-category Fun(K ⊲, S). If p is a colimit diagram, then j(C) ◦ p is a colimit diagram (since C is completely
compact). Lemma 5.1.6.3 now implies that j(D) ◦ p is a colimit diagram as well.

In order to study the condition of complete compactness in more detail, it is convenient to introduce a

slightly more general notion.

Deﬁnition 5.1.6.5. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits, and let φ :
ﬁbration. We will say that φ is completely compact if it is classiﬁed by a functor C →
colimits.

be a diagram of left ﬁbrations over C, which is a homotopy pullback square ( with respect to the covariant
model structure on (Set∆)/ C ). If F → C is completely compact, then F′ → C is completely compact.

Proof. Replacing the diagram by an equivalent one if necessary, we may suppose that it is Cartesian and
that f is a Kan ﬁbration. Let p : K ⊲ → C be a colimit diagram, and let F : C →
S be a functor which
classiﬁes the left ﬁbration F′. We wish to show that F ◦ p is a colimit diagram in
S.

of simplicial sets, which is homotopy Cartesian (with respect to the usual model structure on Set∆) since
the horizontal maps are pullbacks of f . Since F is completely compact, Proposition 3.3.4.5 implies that
the inclusion ψ is a weak homotopy equivalence. It follows that ψ′ is also a weak homotopy equivalence.
Applying Proposition 3.3.4.5 again, we deduce that F ◦ p is a colimit diagram as desired.

Lemma 5.1.6.7. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, p : K → C be a small diagram, and let X ∈ C/p be an
object whose image in C is completely compact. Then X is completely compact.

Proof. Let p : K ⊳ → C be a limit of p, carrying the cone point to an object Z ∈ C. Then we have trivial
ﬁbrations

C/Z ← C/p → C/p .

Consequently, we may replace the diagram p : K → C with the inclusion {Z} → C.

We may identify the object X ∈ C/Z with a morphism f : Y → Z in C. We have a commutative diagram

where φ is a trivial ﬁbration, and φ′ is a pullback of the left ﬁbration left ﬁbration φ′′ : CY / → C. Since Y
is completely compact, φ′′ is completely compact. The projection C/Z → C is equivalent to C/Z → C, and
therefore commutes with colimits by Proposition 1.2.13.8. It follows that φ′ is completely compact, which
completes the proof.

Proposition 5.1.6.8. Let S be a small simplicial set, and let j : S → P(S) denote the Yoneda embedding.
Let C be an object of P(S). The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The object C ∈ P(S) is completely compact.

(2) There exists a vertex s of S such that C is a retract of j(s).

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. Let S/C = S ×P(S) P(S)/C . According to Lemma 5.1.5.3, the
natural map

S⊲
/C

j′
→ P(S)⊲

/C → P(S)

is a colimit diagram. Let f : P(S) → S be the functor corepresented by C. Since C is completely compact.
f (C) can be identiﬁed with a colimit of the diagram f |S/C . The space f (C) is homotopy equivalent to
MapP(S)(C, C), and therefore contains a point corresponding to idC . It follows that idC lies in the image
of MapP(S)(C, j′(
s classiﬁes a vertex s ∈ S
equipped with a morphism α : j(s) → C. It follows that there is a commutative triangle

in the ∞-category P(S), so that C is a retract of j(s).

Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. According to Lemma 5.1.6.4, it suﬃces to prove that j(s) is completely
compact. Using Lemma 5.1.5.2, we may identify the functor P(S) → S co-represented by j(s) with the functor
given by evaluation at s. Proposition 5.1.2.2 implies that this functor preserves all limits and colimits that
exist in P(S).

Example 5.1.6.9. Let C be the ∞-category S of spaces. Then an object C ∈ S is completely compact if
and only if it is equivalent to ∗, the ﬁnal object of S.

We now use the theory of completely compact objects to give a characterization of presheaf ∞-categories.

Proposition 5.1.6.10. Let S be a small simplicial set and C an ∞-category which admits small colimits.
Let F : P(S) → C be functor which preserves small colimits, and f = F ◦ j its composition with the Yoneda
embedding j : S → P(S). Suppose further that:

(1) The functor f is fully faithful.

(2) For every vertex s of S, the object f (s) ∈ C is completely compact.

Then F is fully faithful.

Proof. Let C and D be objects of P(S). We wish to prove that the natural map

ηC,D : MapP(S)(C, D) → MapC(F (C), F (D))

is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H. Suppose ﬁrst that C belongs to the essential image of j.
Let G : P(S) → S be a functor co-represented by C, and let G′ : C → S be a functor co-represented by
F (C). Then we have a natural transformation of functors G → G′ ◦ F . Assumption (2) implies that G′
preserves small colimits, so that G′ ◦ F preserves small colimits. Proposition 5.1.6.8 implies that G preserves
small colimits. It follows that the collection of objects D ∈ P(S) such that ηC,D is an equivalence is stable
under small colimits. If D belongs to the essential image of j, then assumption (1) implies that ηC,D is an
equivalence. It follows from Lemma 5.1.5.3 that the essential image of j generates P(S) under small colimits;
thus ηC,D is an isomorphism in H for every object D ∈ P(S).

We now prove the result in general. Fix D ∈ P(S). Let H : P(S)op → S be a functor represented
by D, and let H ′ : Cop → S be a functor represented by F D. Then we have a natural transformation of
functors H → H ′ ◦ F op, which we wish to prove is an equivalence. By assumption, F op preserves small
limits. Proposition 5.1.3.2 implies that H and H ′ preserve small limits. It follows that the collection P of
objects C ∈ P(S) such that ηC,D is an equivalence is stable under small colimits. The special case above
established that P contains the essential image of the Yoneda embedding. We once again invoke Lemma
5.1.5.3 to deduce every object of P(S) belongs to P , as desired.

Corollary 5.1.6.11. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits. Let S be a small simplicial set
and F : P(S) → C a colimit preserving functor. Then F is an equivalence if and only if the following
conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The composition f = F ◦ j : S → C is fully faithful.

(2) For every vertex s ∈ S, the object f (s) ∈ C is completely compact.

(3) The set of objects {f (s) : s ∈ S0} generates C under colimits.

Proof. If (1), (2), and (3) are satisﬁed, then F is fully faithful (Proposition 5.1.6.10). Since P(S) is admits
small colimits, and F preserves small colimits, the essential image of F is stable under small colimits.
Using (3), we conclude that F is essentially surjective and therefore an equivalence of ∞-categories. For
the converse, it suﬃces to check that idP(S) : P(S) → P(S) satisﬁes (1), (2), and (3). For this, we invoke
Propsition 5.1.3.1, Proposition 5.1.6.8, and Lemma 5.1.5.3, respectively.

Corollary 5.1.6.12. Let C be a small ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a diagram, and let p′ : K → P(C)
be the composition of p with the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C), and let f : C/p → P(C)/p′ be the induced
map. Let F : P(C/p) → P(C)/p′ be a colimit-preserving functor such that F ◦ j′ is equivalent to f , where
j′ : C/p → P(C/p) denotes the Yoneda embedding for C/p (according to Theorem 5.1.5.6, F exists and is
unique up to equivalence). Then F is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Proof. We will show that the f satisﬁes conditions (1) through (3) of Corollary 5.1.6.11. The assertion that
f is fully faithful follows immediately from the assertion that j is fully faithful (Proposition 5.1.3.1). To
prove that the essential image of f consists of completely compact objects, we use Lemma 5.1.6.7 to reduce

269

to proving that the essential image of j consists of completely compact objects of P(C), which follows from
Proposition 5.1.6.8. It remains to prove that P(C)/p′ is generated under colimits by f . Let X be an object
of P(C)/p′ and X its image in P(C). Let D ⊆ P(C) be the essential image of j, and D the inverse image of
D in P(C)/p′ , so that D is the essential image of f . Using Lemma 5.1.5.3, we can choose a colimit diagram
q : L⊲ → P(C) which carries the cone point to X such that q = q|L factors through D. Since the inclusion
of the cone point into L⊲ is right anodyne, there exists a map q′ : L⊲ → P(C)/p′ lifting q, which carries the
cone point of L⊲ to X. Proposition 1.2.13.8 implies that q′ is a colimit diagram, so that X can be written
as the colimit of a diagram L → D.

5.2 Adjoint Functors

Let C and D be (ordinary) categories. Two functors

C

F /
G

/ D

are said to be adjoint to one another if there is a functorial bijection

HomD(F (C), D) ≃ HomC(C, G(D))

deﬁned for C ∈ C, D ∈ D. Our goal in this section is to extend the theory of adjoint functors to the
∞-categorical setting.

By deﬁnition, a pair of functors F and G (as above) are adjoint if and only if they determine the same

correspondence

Cop × D → Set .
In §2.3.1, we introduced an ∞-categorical generalization of the notion of a correspondence. In certain cases,
a correspondence M from an ∞-category C to an ∞-category D determines a functor F : C → D, which
we say is a functor associated to M. We will study these associated functors in §5.2.1. The notion of a
correspondence is self-dual, so it is possible that the correspondence M also determines an associated functor
G : D → C. In this case, we will say that F and G are adjoint. We will study the basic properties of adjoint
functors in §5.2.2.

One of the most important features of adjoint functors is their behavior with respect to limits and colimits:
left adjoints preserve colimits, while right adjoints preserve limits. We will prove an ∞-categorical analogue
of this statement in §5.2.3. In certain situations, the adjoint functor theorem provides a converse to this
statement: see §5.5.2.

The theory of model categories provides a host of examples of adjoint functors between ∞-categories.
In §5.2.4, we will show that a simplicial Quillen adjunction between a pair of model categories (A, A′)
determines an adjunction between the associated ∞-categories (N(A◦), N(A′◦)). We will also consider some
other examples of situations which give rise to adjoint functors.

In §5.2.5, we study the behavior of adjoint functors when restricted to overcategories. Our main result
(Proposition 5.2.5.1) can summarized as follows: suppose that F : C → D is a functor between ∞-categories
which admits a right adjoint G. Assume further that the ∞-category C admits pullbacks. Then for every
object C, the induced functor C/C → D/F C admits a right adjoint, given by the formula

(D → F C) 7→ (GD ×GF C C → C).

If a functor F : C → D has a right adjoint G, then G is uniquely determined up to equivalence. In §5.2.6,

we will prove a strong version of this statement, phrased as an (anti)equivalence of functor categories.

In §5.2.7, we will restrict the theory of adjoint functors to the special case in which one of the functors
is the inclusion of a full subcategory. In this case, we obtain the theory of localizations of ∞-categories.
This theory will play a central role in our study of presentable ∞-categories (§5.5), and later in the study of
∞-topoi (§6). It is also useful in the study of factorization systems on ∞-categories, which we will discuss
in §5.2.8.

Finally, in §5.2.9, we will apply some of the ideas of this and earlier sections to analyze the ∞-category
of equivalences from Cat∞ to itself. The main result (Theorem 5.2.9.1) is that there is essentially only one
nontrivial self-equivalence of Cat∞: namely, the operation which carries each ∞-category C to its opposite
Cop.

5.2.1 Correspondences and Associated Functors

Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. In §3.3.2, we saw that p is classiﬁed by a functor
Sop → Cat∞. In particular, if S = ∆1, then p determines a diagram

G : D → C

271

o
o
in the ∞-category Cat∞, which is well-deﬁned up to equivalence. We can obtain this diagram by applying
the straightening functor St+
S to the marked simplicial set X ♮, and then taking a ﬁbrant replacement. In
general, this construction is rather complicated. However, in the special case where S = ∆1, it is possible to
give a direct construction of G; that is our goal in this section.

Deﬁnition 5.2.1.1. Let p : M → ∆1 be a Cartesian ﬁbration, and suppose given equivalences of ∞-
categories h0 : C → p−1{0} and h1 : D → p−1{1}. We will say that a functor g : D → C is associated to M
if there is a commutative diagram

s

such that s| D ×{1} = h1, s| D ×{0} = h0 ◦ g, and s|{x} × ∆1 is a p-Cartesian edge of M for every object x
of D.

Remark 5.2.1.2. The terminology of Deﬁnition 5.2.1.1 is slightly abusive: it would be more accurate to
say that g is associated to the triple (p : M → ∆1, h0 : C → p−1{0}, h1 : D → p−1{1}).

Proposition 5.2.1.3. Let C and D be ∞-categories, and let g : D → C be a functor.

(1) There exists a diagram

sets, where the marked edges are precisely the equivalences. We set

N = (D♮ ×(∆1)♯)

C♮ .

aD♮ ×{0}♯

The small object argument implies the existence of a factorization

N → N (∞) → (∆1)♯,

where the left map is marked anodyne and the right map has the right lifting property with respect to all
marked anodyne morphisms. We remark that we can obtain N (∞) as the colimit of a transﬁnite sequence
of simplicial sets N (α), where N (0) = N , N (α) is the colimit of the sequence {N (β)}β<α when α is a limit
ordinal, and each N (α + 1) ﬁts into a pushout diagram

where the left vertical map is one of the generators for the class of marked anodyne maps given in Deﬁnition
3.1.1.1. We may furthermore assume that there does not exist a dotted arrow as indicated in the diagram. It
follows by induction on α that N (α)×∆1 {0} ≃ C♮ and N (α)×∆1 {1} ≃ D♮. According to Proposition 3.1.1.6,
N (∞) ≃ M♮ for some Cartesian ﬁbration M → ∆1. It follows immediately that C ≃ M{0}, D ≃ M{1}, and
that g is associated to M.

We now prove (2). The “if” direction is immediate from the deﬁnition. Conversely, suppose that g is
associated to M. To show that g is associated to M′, we need to produce the dotted arrow indicated in the
diagram

According to Proposition A.2.3.1, we may replace M′ by the equivalent ∞-category M; the desired result
then follows form the assumption that g is associated to M.

To prove (3), we take M to be the correspondence constructed in the course of proving (1). It will suﬃce
to construct an appropriate categorical equivalence M → M′; the same argument will construct the desired
map M → M′′. Consider the diagram

(Here we identify N with its underlying simplicial set by forgetting the class of marked edges, and the top
horizontal map exhibits g as associated to M′.) In the terminology of §3.2.2, the maps s and s′ are both
quasi-equivalences. By Proposition 3.2.2.10, they are categorical equivalences. The projection M′ → ∆1
is a categorical ﬁbration and s′ is a trivial coﬁbration, which ensures the existence of the arrow s′′. The
factorization s = s′′ ◦ s′ shows that s′′ is a categorical equivalence, and completes the proof.

Proposition 5.2.1.3 may be informally summarized by saying that every functor g : D → C is associated
to some Cartesian ﬁbration p : M → ∆1, and that M is determined up to equivalence. Conversely, the
Cartesian ﬁbration also determines g:

Proposition 5.2.1.4. Let p : M → ∆1 be a Cartesian ﬁbration, and let h0 : C → p−1{0} and h1 : D →
p−1{1} be categorical equivalences. There exists a functor g : D → C associated to M. Any other functor
g′ : C → D is associated to p if and only if g is equivalent to g′ as objects of the ∞-category CD.

By Proposition 3.1.2.3, the left vertical map is marked anodyne, so the dotted arrow exists. Consider the
map s0 : s| D ×{0} : D → p−1{0}. Since h0 is a categorical equivalence, there exists a map g : D → C such
that the functions h0 ◦ g and s0 are equivalent. Let e : D ×∆1 → M be an equivalence from h0 ◦ g to s0. Let

Because left vertical map is marked anodyne there exists a morphism e′′ as indicated, rendering the diagram

The left vertical map is marked anodyne, so there exists a dotted arrow f ′′ as indicated; then the map
f ′′| D ×∆{0,2} exhibits that g′ is associated to p.

Proposition 5.2.1.5. Let p : M → ∆2 be a Cartesian ﬁbration, and suppose given equivalences of ∞-
categories C → p−1{0}, D → p−1{1}, and E → p−1{2}. Suppose that M ×∆2∆{0,1} is associated to a functor
f : D → C, and that M ×∆2∆{1,2} is associated to a functor g : E → D. Then M ×∆2∆{0,2} is associated to
the composite functor f ◦ g.

Proof. Let X be the mapping simplex of the sequence of functors

E g

→ D f

→ C .

Since f and g are associated to restrictions of M, we obtain a commutative diagram

1 ⊆ E ×∆2, which is inner anodyne. Since p is inner anodyne,
The left vertical inclusion is a pushout of E ×Λ2
there exists a dotted arrow s as indicated in the diagram. The restriction s|X ×∆2 ∆{0,2} exhibits that the
functor f ◦ g is associated to the correspondence M ×∆2∆{0,2}.

Remark 5.2.1.6. Taken together, Propositions 5.2.1.3 and 5.2.1.4 assert that there is a bijective corre-
spondence between equivalence classes of functors D → C and equivalence classes of Cartesian ﬁbrations
p : M → ∆1 equipped with equivalences C → p−1{0}, D → p−1{1}.

5.2.2 Adjunctions

In §5.2.1, we established a dictionary that allows us to pass back and forth between functors g : D → C and
Cartesian ﬁbrations p : M → ∆1. The dual argument shows if p is a coCartesian ﬁbration it also determines
a functor f : C → D. In this case, we will say that f and g are adjoint functors.

Deﬁnition 5.2.2.1. Let C and D be ∞-categories. An adjunction between C and D is a map q : M → ∆1
which is both a Cartesian ﬁbration and a coCartesian ﬁbration, together with equivalences C → M{0} and
D → M{1}.

Let M be an adjunction between C and D, and let f : C → D and g : D → C be functors associated to

M. In this case, we will say that f is left adjoint to g and g is right adjoint to f .

Remark 5.2.2.2. Propositions 5.2.1.3 and 5.2.1.4 imply that if a functor f : C → D has a right adjoint
g : D → C, then g is uniquely determined up to homotopy. In fact, we will later see that g is determined up
to a contractible ambiguity.

We now verify a few basic properties of adjunctions:

In view of the assumption that S = ∆n, there is a unique morphism g0 : p(y) → p(z). Let g : y′ → z be

a locally p-Cartesian edge lifting g0. We have a commutative diagram

Using the two-out-of-three property, we are reduced to proving that both of the diagonal arrows are homotopy

Cartesian. For the arrow on the right, it suﬃces to show that the composition g ◦ e′ is locally p-coCartesian,

Corollary 5.2.2.4. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. An edge e : x → y of X is
p-coCartesian if and only if it is locally p-coCartesian (see the discussion preceding Proposition 2.4.2.8).

Corollary 5.2.2.5. Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The map p is a coCartesian ﬁbration.

(2) For every edge f : s → s′ of S, the induced functor f ∗ : Xs′ → Xs has a left adjoint.

Proof. By deﬁnition, the functor corresponding to an edge f : ∆1 → S has a left adjoint if and only if
the pullback X ×S ∆1 → ∆1 is a coCartesian ﬁbration. In other words, condition (2) is equivalent to the
assertion that for every edge f : s → s′ and every vertex
s of X lifting s, there exists a locally p-coCartesian
edge
f is automatically p-coCartesian, so that
(2) is equivalent to (1).

Proposition 5.2.2.6. Let f : C → D and f ′ : D → E be functors between ∞-categories. Suppose that f has

Proof. Let φ denote the composable sequence of morphisms

Let M (φ) denote the mapping simplex, and choose a factorization

M (φ) s→ X

q
→ ∆2

where s is a quasi-equivalence and X → ∆2 is a Cartesian ﬁbration (using Proposition 3.2.2.11). We ﬁrst
show that q is a coCartesian ﬁbration. In other words, we must show that for every object x ∈ C and every
morphism e : q(x) → y, there is a q-Cartesian edge e : x → y lifting e. This is clear if e is degenerate. If
e = ∆{0,1} ⊆ ∆2, then the existence of a left adjoint to g implies that e has a locally q-coCartesian lift e.
Lemma 5.2.2.3 implies that e is q-coCartesian. Similarly, if e = ∆{1,2}, then we can ﬁnd a q-coCartesian
lift of e. Finally, if e is the long edge ∆{0,2}, then we may write e as a composite e′ ◦ e′′; the existence
of a q-coCartesian lift of e follows from the existence of q-coCartesian lifts of e′ and e′′. We now apply
Proposition 5.2.1.5 and deduce that the adjunction X ×∆2 ∆{0,2} is associated to both g ◦ g′ and f ′ ◦ f .

In classical category theory, one can spell out the relationship between a pair of adjoint functors f : C → D
and g : D → C by specifying a unit transformation idC → g ◦ f (or, dually, a counit f ◦ g → idD). This
concept generalizes to the ∞-categorical setting as follows:

Deﬁnition 5.2.2.7. Suppose given a pair of functors

C

f

g

/ D

between ∞-categories. A unit transformation for (f, g) is a morphism u : idC → g ◦ f in Fun(C, C) with the
following property: for every pair of objects C ∈ C, D ∈ D, the composition

MapD(f (C), D) → MapC(g(f (C)), g(D))

u(C)
→ MapC(C, g(D))

is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H.

Proposition 5.2.2.8. Let f : C → D and g : D → C be a pair of functors between ∞-categories C and D.
The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The functor f is a left adjoint to g.

277

/
o
o
(2) There exists a unit transformation u : idC → g ◦ f .

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. Choose an adjunction p : M → ∆1 which is associated to f and g;
according to (1) of Proposition 5.2.1.3 we may identify M{0} with C and M{1} with D. Since f is associated
to M , there is a map F : C ×∆1 → M such that F | C ×{0} = idC and F | C ×{1} = f , with each edge
F |{c} × ∆1 p-coCartesian. Similarly, there is a map G : D ×∆1 → M with G| D ×{1} = idD, G| D ×{0} = g,
2 × C → M be such that F ′|∆{0,2} × C = F
and G|{d} × ∆1 is p-Cartesian for each object d ∈ D. Let F ′ : Λ2
and F ′|∆{1,2} × C = G ◦ (f × id∆1). Consider the diagram

∆1.

Using the fact F ′|{c} × ∆{1,2} is p-Cartesian for every object c ∈ C, we deduce the existence of the indicated
dotted arrow F ′′. We now deﬁne u = F ′| C ×∆{0,1}. We may regard u as a natural transformation idC → g◦f .
We claim that u is a unit transformation. In other words, we must show that for any objects C ∈ C, D ∈ D,
the composite map

MapD(f C, D) → MapC(gf C, gD) u→ MapC(C, gD)
is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H of spaces. This composite map ﬁts into a commutative
diagram

MapD(f (C), D)

MapD(g(f (C)), g(D))

/ MapD(C, g(D))

MapM (C, D)

/ MapM (C, D).

The left and right vertical arrows in this diagram are given by composition with a p-coCartesian and a
p-Cartesian morphism in M , respectively. Proposition 2.4.4.2 implies that these maps are homotopy equiv-
alences.

We now prove that (2) ⇒ (1). Choose a correspondence p : M → ∆1 from C to D which is associated to

the functor g, via a map G : D ×∆1 → M as above. We have natural transformations

idC

u→ g ◦ f

G◦(f ×id∆1 )

−→ f.

Let F : C ×∆1 → M be a composition of these transformations. We will complete the proof by showing that
F exhibits M as a correspondence associated to the functor f . It will suﬃce to show that for each object
C ∈ C, F (C) : C → f C is p-coCartesian. According to Proposition 2.4.4.3, it will suﬃce to show that for each
object D ∈ D, composition with F (C) induces a homotopy equivalence MapD(f (C), D) → MapM (C, D).
As above, this map ﬁts into a commutative diagram

MapD(f (C), D)

MapD(g(f (C)), g(D))

/ MapD(C, g(D))

MapM (C, D)

/ MapM (C, D)

where the upper horizontal composition is an equivalence (since u is a unit transformation) and the right
vertical arrow is an equivalence (since it is given by composition with a p-Cartesian morphism). It follows
that the left vertical arrow is also a homotopy equivalence, as desired.

Proposition 5.2.2.9. Let C and D be ∞-categories, and let f : C → D and g : D → C be adjoint functors.
Then f and g induce adjoint functors hf : hC → hD and hg : hD → hC between (H-enriched) homotopy
categories.

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 5.2.2.8, since a unit transformation idC → g ◦ f induces a
unit transformation idhC → (hg) ◦ (hf ).

The converse to Proposition 5.2.2.9 is false. If f : C → D and g : D → C are functors such that hf and hg
are adjoint to one another, then f and g are not necessarily adjoint. Nevertheless, the existence of adjoints
can be tested at the level of (enriched) homotopy categories.

Lemma 5.2.2.10. Let p : M → ∆1 be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets, giving a correspondence between
the ∞-categories C = M{0} and D = M{1}. Let c be an object of C, d an object of D, and f : c → d a
morphism. The following are equivalent:

(1) The morphism f is p-Cartesian.

(2) The morphism f gives rise to a Cartesian morphism in the enriched homotopy category hM; in other

words, composition with p induces homotopy equivalences

MapC(c′, c) → MapM(c′, d)

for every object c′ ∈ C.

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.4.4.3.

Lemma 5.2.2.11. Let p : M → ∆1 be an inner ﬁbration, so that M can be identiﬁed with a correspondence
from C = p−1{0} to D = p−1{1}. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map p is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

(2) There exists a H-enriched functor functor g : hD → hC and a functorial identiﬁcation

MapM(c, d) ≃ MapC(c, g(d)).

Proof. If p is a Cartesian ﬁbration, then there is a functor D → C associated to M; we can then take g to
be the associated functor on enriched homotopy categories. Conversely, suppose that there exists a functor
g as above. We wish to show that p is a Cartesian ﬁbration. In other words, we must show that for every
object d ∈ D, there is an object c ∈ C and a p-Cartesian morphism f : c → d. We take c = g(d); in view of
the identiﬁcation MapM(c, d) ≃ MapC(c, c), there exists a morphism f : c → d corresponding to the identity
idc. Lemma 5.2.2.10 implies that f is p-Cartesian, as desired.

Proposition 5.2.2.12. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories. Suppose that the induced functor
of H-enriched categories hf : hC → hD admits a right adjoint. Then f admits a right adjoint.

Proof. According to (1) of Proposition 5.2.1.3, there is a coCartesian ﬁbration p : M → ∆1 associated to f .
Let hg be the right adjoint of hf . Applying Lemma 5.2.2.11, we deduce that p is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Thus
p is an adjunction, so that f has a right adjoint as desired.

5.2.3 Preservation of Limits and Colimits

Let C and D be ordinary categories, and let F : C → D be a functor. If F has a right adjoint G, then F
preserves colimits; we have a chain of natural isomorphisms

HomD(F (lim

Cα), D) ≃ HomC(lim

In fact, this is in some sense the deﬁning feature of left adjoints: under suitable set-theoretic assumptions,
the adjoint functor theorem asserts that any colimit preserving functor admits a right adjoint. We will prove
an ∞-categorical version of the adjoint functor theorem in §5.5.2. Our goal in this section is to lay the
groundwork, by showing that left adjoints preserve colimits in the ∞-categorical setting. We will ﬁrst need
to establish several lemmas.

ψ : MP/ → Mp/

ψ1 : MP/ ×∆1{1} → Mp/ ×∆1{1}.

Proof. If K is a point, then the assertion of the Lemma reduces immediately to the deﬁnition of a coCartesian
edge. In the general case, we note that ψ and ψ1 are both left ﬁbrations between ∞-categories. Consequently,
it suﬃces to show that ψ1 is a categorical equivalence. In doing so, we are free to replace ψ by the equivalent
1 : MP/ ×∆1{1} → Mp/ ×∆1{1} is a trivial ﬁbration, we must show
map ψ′ : MP/ → Mp/. To prove that ψ′

Lemma 5.2.3.2. Let q : M → ∆1 be a correspondence between ∞-categories C = q−1{0} and D = q−1{1},

We order these pairs by setting (L, s) ≤ (L′, s′) if L ⊆ L′ and s = s′|L. By Zorn’s lemma, there exists a pair
(L, s) which is maximal with respect to this ordering. To prove (1), it suﬃces to show that L = K. Otherwise,
∂ ∆n ∆n ⊆ K by adjoining a single nondegenerate simplex.
we may obtain a larger simplicial subset L′ = L

Lemma 5.2.3.3. Let q : M → ∆1 be a correspondence between the ∞-categories C = q−1{0} and D =

that the upper horizontal map carries {n} × ∆1 to an r-Cartesian edge of Mp/, which also follows from
assertion (2) of Lemma 5.2.3.2.

Lemma 5.2.3.4. Let q : M → ∆1 be a Cartesian ﬁbration, and let C = q−1{0}. The inclusion C ⊆ M
preserves all colimits which exist in C.

Proof. Let p : K ⊲ → C be a colimit of p = p|K. We wish to show that Mp/ → Mp/ is a trivial ﬁbration.
Since we have a diagram

of left ﬁbrations, it will suﬃce to show that the induced map

Mp/ → Mp/ → M

Mp/ ×M{d} → Mp/ ×M{d}

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes, for each object d of M. If d belongs to C, this is obvious. In
general, we may choose a q-Cartesian morphism f : c → d in M. Composition with f gives a commutative
diagram

[Mp/ ×M{c}]

[Mp/ ×M{c}]

[Mp/ ×M{d}]

/ [Mp/ ×M{d}]

in the homotopy category H of spaces. The upper horizontal map is a homotopy equivalence since p is a
colimit of p in C. The vertical maps are homotopy equivalences by Lemma 5.2.3.3. Consequently, the bottom
horizontal map is also a homotopy equivalence, as desired.

Proposition 5.2.3.5. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories which has a right adjoint g : D → C.
Then f preserves all colimits which exist in C, and g preserves all limits which exist in D.

Proof. We will show that f preserves colimits; the analogous statement for g follows by a dual argument.
Let p : K ⊲ → C be a colimit for p = p|K. We must show that f ◦ p is a colimit of f ◦ p.

Let q : M → ∆1 be an adjunction between C = M{0} and D = M{1} which is associated to f and g. We

wish to show that

φ1 : Df p/ → Df p/

is a trivial ﬁbration. Since φ1 is a left ﬁbration, it suﬃces to show that φ1 is a categorical equivalence.

Since M is associated to f , there is a map F : C ×∆1 → M with F | C ×{0} = idC, F | C ×{1} = f , and
F |{c} × ∆1 a q-coCartesian morphism of M for every object c ∈ C. Let P = F ◦ (p × id∆1) be the induced
map K ⊲ × ∆1 → M, and let P = P |K × ∆1.

Consider the diagram

Mp/

v

M

P /

u

φ′

/ Mp/

v

/ Mf p/ .

We note that every object in this diagram is an ∞-category with a map to ∆1; moreover, the map φ1 is
obtained from φ by passage to the ﬁber over {1} ⊆ ∆1. Consequently, to prove that φ1 is a categorical
equivalence, it suﬃces to verify three things:

(1) The bottom vertical maps u and u are trivial ﬁbrations. This follows from the fact that K × {1} ⊆

K × ∆1 and K ⊲ × {1} ⊆ K ⊲ × ∆1 are right anodyne inclusions (Proposition 2.1.2.5).

(2) The upper vertical maps v and v are trivial ﬁbrations when restricted to D ⊆ M. This follows from

Lemma 5.2.3.1, since F carries each {c} × ∆1 to a q-coCartesian edge of M.

(3) The map φ′ is a trivial ﬁbration, since p is a colimit of p in M according to Lemma 5.2.3.4.

Remark 5.2.3.6. Under appropriate set-theoretic hypotheses, one can prove a converse to Proposition
5.2.3.5. See Corollary 5.5.2.9.

5.2.4 Examples of Adjoint Functors

In this section, we describe a few simple criteria for establishing the existence of adjoint functors.

Lemma 5.2.4.1. Let q : M → ∆1 be a coCartesian ﬁbration associated to a functor f : C → D, where
C = q−1{0} and D = q−1{1}. Let D be an object of D. The following are equivalent:

(1) There exists a q-Cartesian morphism g : C → D in M, where C ∈ C.

(2) The right ﬁbration C ×D D/D → C is representable.

Proof. Let F : C ×∆1 → M be a p-coCartesian natural transformation from idC to f . Deﬁne a simplicial
set X so that for every simplicial set K, HomSet∆(K, X) parametrizes maps H : K × ∆2 → M such that

h = H|K × {0} factors through C, H|K × ∆{0,1} = F ◦ (h|(K × {0}) × id∆1), and H|K × {2} is the constant
map at the vertex D. We have restriction maps

C ×M M/D

which are both trivial ﬁbrations (the map on the right because M is an ∞-category, the map on the left
because F is a p-coCartesian transformation). Consequently, (2) is equivalent to the assertion that the ∞-
category C ×M M/D has a ﬁnal object. It now suﬃces to observe that a ﬁnal object of C ×M M/D is precisely
a q-Cartesian morphism C → D, where C ∈ C.

Proposition 5.2.4.2. Let F : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories. The following are equivalent:

(1) The functor F has a right adjoint.

(2) For every pullback diagram

C

p′

D

p

C

F /

/ D,

if p is a representable right ﬁbration, then p′ is also a representable right ﬁbration.

Proof. Let M be a correspondence from C to D associated to F , and apply Lemma 5.2.4.1 to each object of
D.

Proposition 5.2.4.3. Let p : C → D be a Cartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let s : D → C be a
section of p such that s(D) is an initial object of CD = C ×D{D} for every object D ∈ D. Then s is a left
adjoint of p.

Proof. Let C0 ⊆ C denote the full subcategory of C spanned by those objects C ∈ C such that C is initial
in the ∞-category Cp(C). According to Proposition 2.4.4.9, the restriction p| C0 is a trivial ﬁbration from
C0 to D. Consequently, it will suﬃce to show that the inclusion C0 ⊆ C is left adjoint to the composition
s ◦ p : C → C0. Let M ⊆ C ×∆1 be the full subcategory spanned by the vertices (C, {i}) where i = 1 or
C ∈ C0. Let q : M → ∆1 be the projection. It is clear that q is a coCartesian ﬁbration which is associated
to the inclusion C0 ⊆ C. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that q is also a Cartesian ﬁbration
which is associated to s ◦ p.

We ﬁrst show that q is a Cartesian ﬁbration. It will suﬃce to show that for any object C ∈ C, there
is a q-Cartesian edge (C′, 0) → (C, 1) in M. By assumption, C′ = (s ◦ p)(C) is an initial object of Cp(C).
Consequently, there exists a morphism f : C′ → C in Cp(C); we will show that f × id∆1 is a q-Cartesian edge
of M. To prove this, it suﬃces to show that for every n ≥ 2 and every diagram

Since g0 carries the initial vertex v of ∆n to an initial object of the ﬁber Cg(v), Lemma 2.4.4.8 implies the
existence of the indicated map g rendering the diagram commutative. This gives rise to a map G : ∆n → M
with the desired properties, and completes the proof that q is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

We now wish to show that s ◦ p is associated to q. To prove this, it suﬃces to prove the existence of a
map H : C ×∆1 → C such that p ◦ H = p ◦ πC, H| C ×{1} = idC, and H|C × {0} = s ◦ p. We construct the
map H inductively, working cell-by-cell on C. Suppose that we have a nondegenerate simplex σ : ∆n → C
and that H has already been deﬁned on skn−1 C ×∆1. To deﬁne H ◦ (σ × id∆1), we must solve a lifting
problem that may be depicted as follows:

We now consider the ﬁltration

∂ ∆n×{0}(∆n × {1}). For i > 0, the inclusion
deﬁned in the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6. Let Y (i) = X(i)
Y (i + 1) ⊆ Y (i) is a pushout of the inclusion X(i + 1) ⊆ X(i), and therefore inner anodyne. Consequently,
we may use the assumption that p is an inner ﬁbration to extend h0 to a map deﬁned on Y (1). The inclusion
Y (1) ⊆ ∆n × ∆1 is a pushout of ∂ ∆n+1 ⊆ ∆n+1; we then obtain the desired extension h by applying Lemma
2.4.4.8.

`

Proposition 5.2.4.4. Let M be a ﬁbrant simplicial category equipped with a functor p : M → ∆1 (here we
identify ∆1 with the two-object category whose nerve is ∆1), so that we may view M as a correspondence
between the simplicial categories C = p−1{0} and D = p−1{1}. The following are equivalent

(1) The map p is a Cartesian ﬁbration.

(2) For every object D ∈ D, there exists a morphism f : C → D in M which induces homotopy equivalences

for every C′ ∈ C.

MapC(C′, C) → MapM(C′, D)

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.4.1.10, since nonempty morphism spaces in ∆1 are
contractible.

Corollary 5.2.4.5. Let C and D be ﬁbrant simplicial categories, and let

be a pair of adjoint functors F : C → D ( in the sense of enriched category theory, so that there is a natural
isomorphism of simplicial sets MapC(F (C), D) ≃ MapD(C, G(D)) for C ∈ C, D ∈ D ). Then the induced
functors

Proof. Let M be the correspondence associated to the adjunction (F, G). In other words, M is a simplicial
category containing C and D as full (simplicial) subcategories, with

MapM(C, D) = MapC(C, G(D)) = MapD(F (C), D)

MapM(D, C) = ∅
for every pair of objects C ∈ C, D ∈ D. Let M = N(M). Then M is a correspondence between N(C) and
N(D). By Proposition 5.2.4.4, it is an adjunction. It is easy to see that this adjunction is associated to both
f and g.

The following variant on the situation of Corollary 5.2.4.5 arises very often in practice:

Proposition 5.2.4.6. Let A and A′ be simplicial model categories, and let

A

F /
G

/A′

be a (simplicial) Quillen adjunction. Let M be the simplicial category deﬁned as in the proof of Corollary
5.2.4.5, and let M◦ be the full subcategory of M consisting of those objects which are ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant (either
as objects of A or as objects of A′). Then N(M◦) determines an adjunction between N(A◦) and N(A′◦).
Proof. We need to show that N(M◦) → ∆1 is both a Cartesian ﬁbration and a coCartesian ﬁbration. We
will argue the ﬁrst point; the second follows from a dual argument. According to Proposition A.2.3.1, it
suﬃces to show that for every ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object D of A′, there is a ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object C of A
and a morphism f : C → D in M◦ which induces weak homotopy equivalences

MapA(C′, C) → MapM(C′, D)

for every ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object C′ ∈ A. We deﬁne C to be a coﬁbrant replacement for GD:
in other
words, we choose a coﬁbrant object C with a trivial ﬁbration C → G(D) in the model category A. Then
MapA(C′, C) → MapM(C′, D) = MapA(C′, G(D)) is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets, whenever C′ is a
coﬁbrant object of A.

Remark 5.2.4.7. Suppose that F : A → A′ and G : A′ → A are as in Proposition 5.2.4.6. We may
associate to the adjunction N(M ◦) a pair of adjoint functors f : N(A◦) → N(A′◦) and g : N(A′◦) → N(A◦).
In this situation, f is often called a (nonabelian) left derived functor of F , and g a (nonabelian) right derived
functor of G. On the level of homotopy categories, f and g reduce to the usual derived functors associated
to the Quillen adjunction (see §A.2.5).

5.2.5 Adjoint Functors and Overcategories

Our goal in this section is to prove the following result:

Proposition 5.2.5.1. Suppose given an adjunction of ∞-categories

C

F /
G

/ D

.

Assume that the ∞-category C admits pullbacks, and let C be an object of C. Then:

(1) The induced functor f : C/C → D/F C admits a right adjoint g.

(2) The functor g is equivalent to the composition

D/F C g′

→ C/GF C g′′

→ C/C ,

where g′ is induced by G and g′′ is induced by pullback along the unit map C → GF C.

286

Proposition 5.2.5.1 is an immediate consequence of the following more general result, which we will prove

at the end of this section:

Lemma 5.2.5.2. Suppose given an adjunction between ∞-categories

C

F /
G

/ D

.

Let K be a simplicial set, and suppose given a pair of diagrams p0 : K → C, p1 : K → D, and a natural
transformation h : F ◦ p0 → p1. Assume that C admits pullbacks and K-indexed limits. Then:

(1) Let f : C/p0 → D/p1 denote the composition

C/p0 → D/F p0 ◦α→ D/p1 .

Then f admits a right adjoint g.

(2) The functor g is equivalent the composition

D/p1 g′

→ C/Gp1 g′′

→ C/p0 .

Here g′′ is induced by pullback along the natural transformation p0 → Gp1 adjoint to h (see below).

We begin by recalling a bit of notation which will be needed in the proof. Suppose that q : X → S is
an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets and pS : K → X is an arbitrary map, then we have deﬁned a map of
simplicial sets X /pS → S, which is characterized by the following universal property: for every simplicial set
Y equipped with a map to S, there is a pullback diagram

HomS(Y, X /pS )

HomS(Y ⋄S S, X)

{p}

/ HomS(S, X).

We refer the reader to §4.2.2 for a more detailed discussion.

Lemma 5.2.5.3. Let q : M → ∆1 be a coCartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, classifying a functor F from
C = M ×∆1{0} to D = M ×∆1{1}. Let K be a simplicial set, and suppose given a commutative diagram

K × ∆1

g∆1

which restricts to give a pair of diagrams

C g0← K

g1→ D .

Then:

(1) The projection q′ : M/g∆1 → ∆1 is a coCartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, classifying a functor
F ′ : C/g0 → D/g1 . Moreover, an edge of M/g∆1 is q′-coCartesian if and only if its image in M is
q-coCartesian.

(2) Suppose that for every vertex k in K, the map g∆ carries {k} × ∆1 to a q-coCartesian morphism in
M, so that g∆1 determines an equivalence g1 ≃ F ◦ g0. Then F ′ is homotopic to the composite functor

C/g0 → D/F g0 ≃ D/g1 .

(3) Suppose that M = D ×∆1, and that q is the projection onto the second factor, so that we can identify
F with the identity functor from D to itself. Let g : K × ∆1 → D denote the composition g∆1 with the
projection map M → D, so that we can regard g as a morphism from g0 to g1 in Fun(K, D). Then the
functor F ′ : D/g0 → D/g1 is induced by composition with g.

Proof. Assertion (1) follows immediately from Proposition 4.2.2.4.

We now prove (2). Since F is associated to the correspondence M, there exists a natural transformation
α : C ×∆1 → M from idC to F , such that for each C′ ∈ C, the induced map αC : C′ → F C′ is q-coCartesian.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that g∆1 is given by the composition

K × ∆1 g0→ C ×∆1 α→ M .

In this case, α induces a map α′ : C/g0 ×∆1 → M/g∆1 , which we may identify with a natural transformation
from idC/g0 to the functor C/g0 → D/F g0 determined by F . To show that this functor coincides with F ′, it
will suﬃce to show that α′ carries each object of C/g0 to a q′-coCartesian morphism in M/g∆1 . This follows
immediately from the description of the q′-coCartesian edges given in assertion (1).

We next prove (3). Consider the diagram

D/g0 p

← D/g p′

→ D/g1 .

By deﬁnition, “composition with g” refers to a functor from D/g0 to D/g1 obtained by composing p′ with a
section to the trivial ﬁbration p. To prove that this functor is homotopic to F ′, it will suﬃce to show that
F ′ ◦ p is homotopic to p′. For this, we must produce a map β : D/g ×∆1 → M/g∆1 from p to p′, such that
β carries each object of D/g to a q′-coCartesian edge of M/g∆1 . We observe that D/g ×∆1 can be identiﬁed
with M/h∆1 , where h : ∆1 × ∆1 → M ≃ D ×∆1 is the product of g with the identity map. We now take β
to be the restriction map M/h∆1 → M/g∆1 induced by the diagonal inclusion ∆1 ⊆ ∆1 × ∆1. Using (1), we
readily deduce that β has the desired properties.

We will also need the following counterpart to Proposition 4.2.2.4:

S = q ◦ pS. Then the map q′ : X /pS → Y /p′
Let p′
q′-Cartesian if and only if its image in X is q-Cartesian.

S is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Moreover, an edge of X /pS is

X ♮. Using Proposition 3.1.1.6 again (and our assumption that q is a Cartesian ﬁbration), we are reduced to
proving that the map j induces a marked anodyne map

(A × (K × ∆1)♭)

(B × (K × ∂ ∆1)♭) → B × (K × ∆1)♭.

aA×(K×∂ ∆1)♭

Since i is marked anodyne by assumption, this follows immediately from Proposition 3.1.2.3.

Lemma 5.2.5.5. Let q : M → ∆1 be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, associated to a functor G from
D = M ×∆1{1} to C = M ×∆1{0}. Suppose given a simplicial set K and a commutative diagram

if and only if its image in M is q-Cartesian.

(2) The associated functor D/g1 → C/g0 is homotopic to the composition of the functor G′ : D/g1 → C/Gg1

induced by G and the equivalence C/Gg1 ≃ C/g0 determined by the map g∆1.

Proof. Assertion (1) follows immediately from Lemma 5.2.5.4. We will prove (2). Since the functor G is
associated to q, there exists a map α : D ×∆1 → M which is a natural transformation from G to idD, such
that for every object D ∈ D the induced map αD : {D} × ∆1 → M is a q-Cartesian edge of M. Without loss
of generality, we may assume that g coincides with the composition

K × ∆1 g1→ D ×∆1 α→ M .

In this case, α induces a map α′ : D/g1 ×∆1 → M/f∆1 , which is a natural transformation from G′ to the
identity. Using (1), we deduce that α′ carries each object of D/g1 to a q′-Cartesian edge of M/f∆1 . It follows
that α′ exhibits G′ as the functor associated to the Cartesian ﬁbration q′, as desired.

Proof of Lemma 5.2.5.2. Let q : M → ∆1 be a correspondence from C = M ×∆1{0} to D = M ×∆1{1},
which is associated to the pair of adjoint functors F and G. The natural transformation h determines a map
map α determines a map α : K × ∆1 → M, which is a natural transformation from p0 to p1. Using the fact
that q is both a Cartesian and a coCartesian ﬁbration, we can form a commutative square σ:

in the ∞-category Fun(K, M), where the morphism φ is q-Cartesian and the morphism ψ is q-coCartesian.
Let N = M ×∆1. We can identify σ with a map σ∆1×∆1 : K × ∆1 × ∆1 → M ×∆1. Let N′ = N/σ∆1 ×∆1 .
Proposition 4.2.2.4 implies that the projection N′ → ∆1 × ∆1 is a coCartesian ﬁbration, associated to some

Lemma 5.2.5.3 allows us to identify the functors in the lower triangle, so we see that the horizontal compo-
sition is homotopic to the functor f . To complete the proof of (1), it will suﬃce to show that the functors
f ′ and f ′′ admit right adjoints. To prove (2), it suﬃces to show that those right adjoints are given by g′ and
g′′, respectively. The adjointness of f ′ and g′ follows from Lemma 5.2.5.5.

It follows from Lemma 5.2.5.3 that the functor f ′′ : C/p0 → C/Gp1 is given by composition with the
transformation h′ : p0 → Gp1 which is adjoint to h. The pullback functor g′′ is right adjoint to f ′′ by
deﬁnition; the only nontrivial point is to establish the existence of g′′. Here we must use our hypotheses on
the ∞-category C. Let p0 : K ⊳ → C be a limit of p0, let Gp1 : K ⊳ → C be a limit of Gp1. Let us identify h′
′
: K ⊳ × ∆1 → C which is a natural transformation from
with a map K × ∆1 → C, and choose an extension h
p0 to Gp1. Let C ∈ C denote the image under p0 of the cone point of K ⊳, let C′ ∈ C denote the image under
Gp1 of the cone point of K ⊳, and let j : C → C′ be the morphism induced by h

5.2.6 Uniqueness of Adjoint Functors

We have seen that if f : C → D is a functor which admits a right adjoint g : D → C, then g is uniquely
determined up to homotopy. Our next result is a slight reﬁnement of this assertion.

Deﬁnition 5.2.6.1. Let C and D be ∞-categories. We let FunL(C, D) ⊆ Fun(C, D) denote the full sub-
category of Fun(C, D) spanned by those functors F : C → D which are left adjoints. Similarly, we deﬁne
FunR(C, D) to be the full subcategory of Fun(C, D) spanned by those functors which are right adjoints.

Proposition 5.2.6.2. Let C and D be ∞-categories. Then the ∞-categories FunL(C, D) and FunR(D, C)op
are (canonically) equivalent to one another.

Proof. Enlarging the universe if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality that C and D are small.
Let j : D → P(D) be the Yoneda embedding. Composition with j induces a fully faithful embedding

i : Fun(C, D)→ Fun(C, P(D)) ≃ Fun(C × Dop, S).

The essential image of i consists of those functors G : C × Dop → S with the property that, for each C ∈ C,
the induced functor GC : Dop → S is representable by an object D ∈ D. The functor i induces a fully faithful
embedding

i0 : FunR(C, D) → Fun(C × Dop, S)

whose essential image consists of those functors G which belong to the essential image of i, and furthermore
satisfy the additional condition that for each D ∈ D, the induced functor GD : C → S is corepresentable by
an object C ∈ C (this follows from Proposition 5.2.4.2). Let E ⊆ Fun(C × Dop, S) be the full subcategory
spanned by those functors which satisfy these two conditions, so that the Yoneda embedding induces an
equivalence

FunR(C, D) → E .

We note that the above conditions are self-dual, so that the same reasoning gives an equivalence of ∞-
categories

FunR(Dop, Cop) → E .
We now conclude by observing that there is a natural equivalence of ∞-categories FunR(Dop, Cop) ≃
FunL(D, C)op.

We will later need a slight reﬁnement of Proposition 5.2.6.2, which exhibits some functoriality in C. We

begin with a few preliminary remarks concerning the construction of presheaf ∞-categories.

Let f : C → C′ be a functor between small ∞-categories. Then composition with f induces a restriction
functor G : P(C′) → P(C). However, there is another slightly less evident functoriality of the construction

C 7→ P(C). Namely, according to Theorem 5.1.5.6, there is a colimit-preserving functor P(f ) : P(C) → P(C′),
uniquely determined up to equivalence, such that the diagram

C

f

/ C′

P(C)

P(f )

/ P(C′)

commutes up to homotopy (here the vertical arrows are given by the Yoneda embeddings).
The functor P(f ) has an alternative characterization in the language of adjoint functors:

Proposition 5.2.6.3. Let f : C → C′ be a functor between small ∞-categories, let G : P(C′) → P(C) be the
functor given by composition with f . Then G is right adjoint to P(f ).

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that G admits a left adjoint. Let e : P(C) → Fun(P(C)op,
S) denote the Yoneda
embedding. According to Proposition 5.2.4.2, it will suﬃce to show that for each M ∈ P(C), the composite
functor e(M ) ◦ G is corepresentable. Let D denote the full subcategory of P(C) spanned by those objects
M such that G ◦ eM is corepresentable. Since P(C) admits small colimits, Proposition 5.1.3.2 implies that
the collection of corepresentable functors on P(C) is stable under small colimits. According to Propositions
5.1.3.2 and 5.1.2.2, the functor M 7→ e(M ) ◦ G preserves small colimits. It follows that D is stable under
small colimits in P(C). Since P(C) is generated under small colimits by the Yoneda embedding jC′ : C → P(C)
(Corollary 5.1.5.8), it will suﬃce to show that jC(C) ∈ D for each C ∈ C. According to Lemma 5.1.5.2,
e(jC(C)) is equivalent to the functor P(C) →
S given by evaluation at C. Then e(jC(C)) ◦ G is equivalent to
the functor given by evaluation at f (C) ∈ C′, which is corepresentable (Lemma 5.1.5.2 again). We conclude
that G has a left adjoint F .

To complete the proof, we must show that F is equivalent to P(f ). To prove this, it will suﬃce to show

that F preserves small colimits and that the diagram

f

C

C′

P(C)

F /

/ P(C′)

commutes up to homotopy. The ﬁrst point is obvious: since F is a left adjoint, it preserves all colimits
which exist in P(C) (Proposition 5.2.3.5). For the second, choose a counit map v : F ◦ G → idP(C′). By
construction, the functor f induces a natural transformation u : jC → G ◦ jC′ ◦ f . To complete the proof, it
will suﬃce to show that the composition

θ : F ◦ jC

u→ F ◦ G ◦ jC′ ◦ f v→ jC′ ◦ f

is an equivalence of functors from C to P(C′). Fix objects C ∈ C, M ∈ P(C′). We have a commutative
diagram

MapP(C′)(jC′(f (C)), M )

/ MapP(C)(G(jC′ (f (C))), G(M ))

MapP(C)(jC(C), G(M ))

MapP(C′)(jC′(f (C)), M )

/ MapP(C′)(F (G(jC′ (f (C)))), M )

/ MapP(C′)(F (jC(C)), M )

in the homotopy category H of spaces, where the vertical arrows are isomorphisms. Consequently, to prove
that the lower horizontal composition is an isomorphism, it suﬃces to prove that the upper horizontal com-
position is an isomorphism. Using Lemma 5.1.5.2, we reduce to the assertion that M (f (C)) → (G(M ))(C)
is an isomorphism in H, which follows immediately from the deﬁnition of G.

Remark 5.2.6.4. Suppose given a functor f : D → D′ which admits a right adjoint g. Let E ⊆
Fun(C × Dop, S) and E′ ⊆ Fun(C ×(D′)op, S) be deﬁned as in the proof of Proposition 5.2.6.2, and consider

Here the middle vertical map is given by composition with idC ×f . The square on the right is manifestly

observe that the square in question is given by applying the functor Map(C, •) to the diagram

where G is given by composition with f and the horizontal arrows are given by the Yoneda embedding.
Let P0(D) ⊆ P(D) and P0(D′) denote the essential images of the Yoneda embeddings. Proposition 5.2.4.2
asserts that G carries P0(D′) into P0(D), so that it will suﬃce to verify that the diagram

D

into a commutative diagram

In particular, P(f ) carries P0(D) into P0(D′) and therefore restricts to give a left adjoint F 0 : P0(D) →
P0(D′) which veriﬁes the desired commutativity.

We conclude this section by establishing the following consequence of Proposition 5.2.6.3:

Corollary 5.2.6.5. Let C be a small ∞-category, D a locally small ∞-category which admits small colimits.
Let F : P(C) → D be a colimit-preserving functor, let f : C → D denotes the composition of F with the
Yoneda embedding of C, and let G : D → P(C) be the functor given by the composition

Then G is a right adjoint to F . Moreover, the map

f = F ◦ j → (F ◦ (G ◦ F )) ◦ j = (F ◦ G) ◦ f

exhibits F ◦ G as a left Kan extension of f along itself.

The proof requires a few preliminaries:

Lemma 5.2.6.6. Suppose given a pair of adjoint functors

C

f

g

/ D

between ∞-categories. Let T : C → X be any functor. Then T ◦ g : D → X is a left Kan extension of T along
f .

Proof. Let p : M → ∆1 be a correspondence associated to the pair of adjoint functors f and g. Choose a
p-Cartesian homotopy h from r to idM , where r is a functor from M to C; thus r| D is homotopic to g. It
will therefore suﬃce to show that the composition

T : M r→ C T→ X

is a left Kan extension of T | C ≃ T . For this, we must show that for each D ∈ D, the functor T exhibits
T (D) as a colimit of the diagram

(C ×M M/D) → M T→ X .
We observe that C ×M M/D has a ﬁnal object, given by any p-Cartesian morphism e : C → D. It therefore
suﬃces to show that T (e) is an equivalence in X, which follows immediately from the construction of T .

Lemma 5.2.6.7. Let f : C → C′ be a functor between small ∞-categories and X an ∞-category which admits
small colimits. Let H : P(C) → X be a functor which preserves small colimits, and h : C → X the composition
of F with the Yoneda embedding jC : C → P(C). Then the composition

C′ jC′

→ P(C′)

◦f
→ P(C)

H
→ X

is a left Kan extension of h along f .

Proof. Let G : P(C′) → P(C) be the functor given by composition with f . In view of Proposition 4.3.2.8, it
will suﬃce to show that H ◦ G is a left Kan extension of h along jC ◦ f .

Theorem 5.1.5.6 implies the existence of a functor F : P(C) → P(C′) which preserves small colimits, such
that F ◦ jC ≃ jC′ ◦ f . Moreover, Lemma 5.1.5.5 ensures that F is a left Kan extension of f along the fully
faithful Yoneda embedding jC. Using Proposition 4.3.2.8 again, we are reduced to proving that H ◦ G is a
left Kan extension of H along F . This follows immediately from Proposition 5.2.6.3 and Lemma 5.2.6.6.

Proof of Corollary 5.2.6.5. The ﬁrst claim follows from Proposition 5.2.6.3. To prove the second, we may
assume without loss of generality that D is minimal, so that D is union of small full subcategories {Dα}.
It will suﬃce to show that, for each index α such that f factors through Dα, the restricted transformation
f → ((F ◦ G)| Dα) ◦ f exhibits (F ◦ G)| Dα as a left Kan extension of f along the induced map C → Dα,
which follows from Lemma 5.2.6.7.

5.2.7 Localization Functors

Suppose we are given a ∞-category C and a collection S of morphisms of C which we would like to invert.
In other words, we wish to ﬁnd an ∞-category S−1 C equipped with a functor η : C → S−1 C which carries
each morphism in S to an equivalence, and is in some sense universal with respect to these properties. One
can give a general construction of S−1 C using the formalism of §3.1.1. Without loss of generality, we may
suppose that S contains all the identity morphisms in C. Consequently, the pair (C, S) may be regarded as
a marked simplicial set, and we can choose a marked anodyne map (C, S) → (S−1 C, S′), where S−1 C is an
∞-category and S′ is the collection of all equivalences in S−1 C. However, this construction is generally very
diﬃcult to analyze, and the properties of S−1 C are very diﬃcult to control. For example, it might be the
case that C is locally small and S−1 C is not.

Under suitable hypotheses on S (see §5.5.4), there is a drastically simpler approach: we can ﬁnd the

desired ∞-category S−1 C inside of C, as the full subcategory of S-local objects of C.

Example 5.2.7.1. Let C be the (ordinary) category of abelian groups, p a prime number, and let S denote
the collection of morphisms f whose kernel and cokernel consist entirely of p-power torsion elements. A
morphism f lies in S if and only if it induces an isomorphism after inverting the prime number p. In this
case, we may identify S−1 C with the full subcategory of C consisting of those abelian groups which are
uniquely p-divisible. The functor C → S−1 C is given by

M 7→ M ⊗Z Z[

1
p

].

In Example 5.2.7.1, the functor C → S−1 C is actually left adjoint to an inclusion functor. We will take

this as our starting point.

Deﬁnition 5.2.7.2. A functor f : C → D between ∞-categories is a localization if f has a fully faithful
right adjoint.

Warning 5.2.7.3. Let f : C → D be a localization functor, and let S denote the collection of all morphisms
α in C such that f (α) is an equivalence. Then, for any ∞-category E, composition with f induces a fully
faithful functor

Fun(D, E)

◦f
→ Fun(C, E)

whose essential image consists of those functors p : C → E which carry each α ∈ S to an equivalence in E
(Proposition 5.2.7.12). We may describe the situation more informally by saying that D is obtained from C
by inverting the morphisms of S.

Some authors use the term “localization” in a more general sense, to describe any functor f : C → D in
which D is obtained by inverting some collection S of morphisms in C. Such a morphism f need not be a
localization in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.2.7.2; however, it is in many cases (see Proposition 5.5.4.15).

If f : C → D is a localization of ∞-categories, then we will also say that D is a localization of C. In this
case, a right adjoint g : D → C of f gives an equivalence between D and a full subcategory of C (the essential
image of g). We let L : C → C denote the composition g ◦ f . We will abuse terminology by referring to L as
a localization functor if it arises in this way.

The following result will allow us to recognize localization functors:

Proposition 5.2.7.4. Let C be a ∞-category, and let L : C → C be a functor with essential image L C ⊆ C.
The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) There exists a functor f : C → D with a fully faithful right adjoint g : D → C, and an equivalence

between g ◦ f and L.

(2) When regarded as a functor from C to L C, L is a left adjoint of the inclusion L C ⊆ C.

295

(3) There exists a natural transformation α : C ×∆1 → C from idC to L such that, for every object C of C,

the morphisms L(α(C)), α(LC) : LC → LLC of C are equivalences.

Proof. It is obvious that (2) implies (1) (take D = L C, f = L, and g to be the inclusion). The converse
follows from the observation that, since g is fully faithful, we are free to replace D by the essential image of
g (which is equal to the essential image of L).

We next prove that (2) implies (3). Let α : idC → L be a unit for the adjunction. Then, for each pair of

objects C ∈ C, D ∈ L C, composition with α(C) induces a homotopy equivalence

MapC(LC, D) → MapC(C, D),

and in particular a bijection HomhC(LC, D) → HomhC(C, D). If C belongs to L C, then Yoneda’s lemma
implies that α(C) is an isomorphism in hC. This proves that α(LC) is an equivalence for every C ∈ C. Since
α is a natural transformation, we have obtain a diagram

C

α(C)

LC

α(C)

Lα(C)

LC

α(LC)

/ LLC.

Since composition with α(C) gives an injective map from HomhC(LC, LLC) to HomhC(C, LLC), we conclude
that α(LC) is homotopic to Lα(C); in particular, α(LC) is also an equivalence. This proves (3).

Now suppose that (3) is satisﬁed; we will prove that α is the unit of an adjunction between C and L C.
In other words, we must show that for each C ∈ C and D ∈ C, composition with α(C) induces a homotopy
equivalence

φ : MapC(LC, LD) → MapC(C, LD).

By Yoneda’s lemma, it will suﬃce to show that for every Kan complex K, the induced map

HomH(K, MapC(LC, LD)) → HomH(K, MapC(C, LD))

is a bijection of sets, where H denotes the homotopy category of spaces. Replacing C by Fun(K, C), we are
reduced to proving the following:

(∗) Suppose that α : idC → L satisﬁes (3). Then, for every pair of objects C, D ∈ C, composition with

α(C) induces a bijection of sets

φ : HomhC(LC, LD) → HomhC(C, LD).

We ﬁrst show that φ is surjective. Let f be a morphism from C to LD. We then have a commutative

diagram

C

f

LD

α(C)

α(LD)

LC

Lf

/ LLD,

so that f is homotopic to the composition (α(LD)−1 ◦ Lf ) ◦ α(C); this proves that the homotopy class of f
lies in the image of φ.

We now show that φ is injective. Let g : LC → LD be an arbitrary morphism. We have a commutative

diagram

so that g is homotopic to the composition

α(LD)−1 ◦ Lg ◦ α(LC) ≃ α(LD)−1 ◦ Lg ◦ Lα(C) ◦ (Lα(C))−1 ◦ α(LC)
≃ α(LD)−1 ◦ L(g ◦ α(C)) ◦ (Lα(C))−1 ◦ α(LC)

In particular, g is determined by g ◦ α(C) up to homotopy.

Remark 5.2.7.5. Let L : C → D be a localization functor and K a simplicial set. Suppose that every
diagram p : K → C admits a colimit in C. Then the ∞-category D has the same property. Moreover, we can
give an explicit prescription for computing colimits in D. Let q : K → D be a diagram, and let p : K → C
be the composition of q with a right adjoint to L. Choose a colimit p : K ⊲ → C. Since L is a left adjoint,
L ◦ p is a colimit diagram in D, and L ◦ p is equivalent to the diagram q.

We conclude this section by introducing a few ideas which will allow us to recognize localization functors,

when they exist.

Deﬁnition 5.2.7.6. Let C be an ∞-category and C0 ⊆ C a full subcategory. We will say that a morphism
f : C → D in C exhibits D as a C0-localization of C if D ∈ C0, and composition with f induces an
isomorphism

in the homotopy category H, for each object E ∈ C0.

MapC0(D, E) → MapC(C, E)

Remark 5.2.7.7. In the situation of Deﬁnition 5.2.7.6, a morphism f : C → D exhibits D as a localization
of C if and only if f is an initial object of the ∞-category C0
C/ = CC/ ×C C0. In particular, f is uniquely
determined up to equivalence.

Proposition 5.2.7.8. Let C be an ∞-category and C0 ⊆ C a full subcategory. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) For every object C ∈ C, there exists a localization f : C → D relative to C0.

(2) The inclusion C0 ⊆ C admits a left adjoint.

Proof. Let D be the full subcategory of C ×∆1 spanned by objects of the form (C, i), where C ∈ C0 if i = 1.
Then the projection p : D → ∆1 is a correspondence from C to C0 which is associated to the inclusion functor
i : C0 ⊆ C. It follows that i admits a left adjoint if and only if p is a coCartesian ﬁbration. It now suﬃces to
observe that if C is an object of C, then we may identify p-coCartesian edges f : (C, 0) → (D, 1) of D with
localizations C → D relative to C0.

Remark 5.2.7.9. By analogy with classical category theory, we will say that a full subcategory C0 of an
∞-category C is a reﬂective subcategory if the hypotheses of Proposition 5.2.7.8 are satisﬁed by the inclusion
C0 ⊆ C.

Example 5.2.7.10. Let C be an ∞-category which has a ﬁnal object, and let C0 be the full subcategory of
C spanned by the ﬁnal objects. Then the inclusion C0 ⊆ C admits a left adjoint.

Corollary 5.2.7.11. Let p : C → D be a coCartesian ﬁbrations between ∞-categories, let D0 ⊆ D be a full
subcategory, and let C0 = C ×D D0. If the inclusion D0 ⊆ D admits a left adjoint, then the inclusion C0 ⊆ C
admits a left adjoint.

Proof. In view of Proposition 5.2.7.8, it will suﬃce to show that for every object C ∈ C, there a morphism
f : C → C0 which is a localization of C relative to C0. Let D = p(C), let f : D → D0 be a localization of

297

D relative to D0, and let f : C → C0 be a p-coCartesian morphism in C lifting f . We claim that f has the
desired property. Choose any object C′ ∈ C0, and let D′ = p(C′) ∈ D0. We obtain a diagram of spaces

MapC(C0, C′)

MapD(D0, D′)

φ

ψ

MapC(C, C′)

/ MapD(D, D′)

which commutes up to preferred homotopy. By assumption, the map ψ is a homotopy equivalence. Since f
is p-coCartesian, the map φ induces a homotopy equivalence after passing to the homotopy ﬁbers over any
pair of points η ∈ MapD(D0, D′), ψ(η) ∈ MapD(D, D′). Using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups
associated to the vertical ﬁbrations, we conclude that φ is a homotopy equivalence, as desired.

Proposition 5.2.7.12. Let C be an ∞-category, let L : C → C be a localization functor with essential image
L C. Let S denote the collection of all morphisms f in C such that Lf is an equivalence. Then, for every
∞-category D, composition with f induces a fully faithful functor

ψ : Fun(L C, D) → Fun(C, D).

Moreover, the essential image of ψ consists of those functors F : C → D such that F (f ) is an equivalence in
D, for each f ∈ S.

Proof. Let S0 be the collection of all morphisms C → D in C which exhibit D as an L C-localization of C.
We ﬁrst claim that, for any functor F : C → D, the following conditions are equivalent:

(a) The functor F is a right Kan extension of F |L C.

(b) The functor F carries each morphism in S0 to an equivalence in D.

(c) The functor F carries each morphism in S to an equivalence in D.

The equivalence of (a) and (b) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions (since a morphism f : C → D
exhibits D as an L C-localization of C if and only if f is an initial object of (L C)×C CC/ ), and the implication
(c) ⇒ (b) is obvious. To prove that (b) ⇒ (c), let us consider any map f : C → D which belongs to S. We
have a commutative diagram

C

D

f

LC

f

/ LD.

Since f ∈ S, the map Lf is an equivalence in C. If F satisﬁes (b), then F carries each of the horizontal maps
to an equivalence in D. It follows from the two-out-of-three property that F f is an equivalence in D as well,
so that F satisﬁes (c).

Let Fun0(C, D) denote the full subcategory of Fun(C, D) spanned by those functors which satisfy (a), (b),
and (c). Using Proposition 4.3.2.15, we deduce that the restriction functor φ : Fun0(C, D) → Fun(L C, D)
is fully faithful. We now observe that ψ is a right homotopy inverse to φ. It follows that φ is essentially
surjective, and therefore an equivalence. Being right homotopy inverse to an equivalence, the functor ψ must
itself be an equivalence.

5.2.8 Factorization Systems

Let f : X → Z be a map of sets. Then f can be written as a composition

f ′
→ Y

f ′′
→ Z

X

where f ′ is surjective and f ′′ is injective. This factorization is uniquely determined up to (unique) isomor-
phism: the set Y can be characterized either as the image of the map f , or as the quotient of X by the
equivalence relation R = {(x, y) ∈ X 2 : f (x) = f (y)}. We can describe the situation formally by saying that
the collections of surjective and injective maps form a factorization system on the category Set of sets (see
Deﬁnition 5.2.8.8). In this section, we will describe a theory of factorization systems in the ∞-categorical
setting. These ideas are due to Joyal and we refer the reader to [44] for further details.

Deﬁnition 5.2.8.1. Let f : A → B and g : X → Y be morphisms in an ∞-category C. We will say that f
is left orthogonal to g, or that g is right orthogonal to f , if the following condition is satisﬁed:

and X with the corresponding objects of CA/ /Y .)

(B, X) is contractible. (Here we abuse notation by identifying B

morphism g : X → Y if, for every commutative diagram

Remark 5.2.8.5. Let C be an ordinary category containing a pair of morphisms f and g. If f ⊥ g, then
f has the left lifting property with respect to g, and g has the right lifting property with respect to f . It
follows that for any collection S of morphisms in C, we have inclusions S⊥ ⊆ S⊥ and ⊥S ⊆⊥ S, where the
latter classes of morphisms are deﬁned in §A.1.2.

Applying Remark 5.2.8.3 to an ∞-category C and its opposite, we obtain the following result:

Proposition 5.2.8.6. Let C be an ∞-category and S a collection of morphisms in C.

(1) The sets of morphisms S⊥ and ⊥S contain every equivalence in C.

(2) The sets of morphisms S⊥ and ⊥S are closed under the formation of retracts.

Deﬁnition 5.2.8.8 (Joyal). Let C be an ∞-category. A factorization system on C is a pair (SL, SR), where
SL and SR are collections of morphisms of C which satisfy the following axioms:

(1) The collections SL and SR are stable under the formation of retracts.

(2) Every morphism in SL is left orthogonal to every morphism in SR.

We will call SL the left set of the factorization system, and SR the right set of the factorization system.

Example 5.2.8.9. Let C be an ∞-category. Then C admits a factorization system (SL, SR), where SL is
the collection of all equivalences in C, and SR consists of all morphisms of C.

Remark 5.2.8.10. Let (SL, SR) be a factorization system on an ∞-category C. Then (SR, SL) is a factor-
ization system on the opposite ∞-category Cop.

SL = ⊥SR and SR = S⊥

Proof. By symmetry, it will suﬃce to prove the ﬁrst assertion. The inclusion SL ⊆ ⊥SR follows immediately
from the deﬁnition. To prove the reverse inclusion, let us suppose that h : X → Z is a morphism in C which

Since h ⊥ g, we can complete this diagram to a 3-simplex of C as indicated. This 3-simplex exhibits h as a

Remark 5.2.8.12. It follows from Proposition 5.2.8.11 that a factorization system (SL, SR) on an ∞-
category C is completely determined by either the left set SL or the right set SR.

Remark 5.2.8.14. It follows from Corollary 5.2.8.13 that a factorization system (SL, SR) on C determines a
pair of subcategories CL, CR ⊆ C, each containing all the objects of C: the morphisms of CL are the elements
of SL, and the morphisms of CR are the elements of SR.

Example 5.2.8.15. Let p : C → D be a coCartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories. Then there is an associated
factorization system (SL, SR) on C, where SL is the class of p-coCartesian morphisms of C, and SR is the
class of morphisms g of C such that p(g) is an equivalence in D. If D ≃ ∆0, this recovers the factorization
system of Example 5.2.8.9; if p is an isomorphism, this recovers the opposite of the factorization system of
Example 5.2.8.9.

Example 5.2.8.16. Let X be an ∞-topos and let n ≥ −2 be an integer. Then there exists a factorization
system (SL, SR) on X, where SL denotes the collection of (n + 1)-connective morphisms of X and SR the
collection of n-truncated morphisms of C. See §6.5.1.

More precisely, we have the following result:

Proposition 5.2.8.17. Let C be an ∞-category and let SL and SR be collections of morphisms in C. Suppose
that SL and SR are stable under equivalence in Fun(∆1, C), and contain every equivalence in C. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(1) The pair (SL, SR) is a factorization system on C.

(2) The restriction map p : Fun′(∆2, C) → Fun(∆{0,2}, C) is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. Here Fun′(∆2, C)

The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 5.2.8.17. We begin with a few

preliminary results.

Lemma 5.2.8.19. Let C be an ∞-category and let (SL, SR) be a factorization system on C. Let D be the
full subcategory of Fun(∆1, C) spanned by the elements of SR. Then:

(1) The ∞-category D is a localization of Fun(∆1, C); in other words, the inclusion D ⊆ Fun(∆1, C) admits

a left adjoint.

system that for every object h ∈ Fun(∆1, C), there exists a morphism α : h → g satisfying the condition
stated in (2), which therefore exhibits g as a D-localization of h. Invoking Proposition 5.2.7.8, we will deduce
(1). Because a D-localization of h is uniquely determined up to equivalence, we will also deduce the “only
if” direction of assertion (2).

Suppose given a commutative diagram

f

e

h

Z ′

/ Y

g

/ Z

where f ∈ SL, g ∈ SR, and e is an equivalence, and let g : Y → Z be another element of SR. We have a

MapC(Z, Z)

ψ

ψ0

MapFun(∆1,C)(h, g)

/ MapC(Z ′, Z)

which commutes up to canonical homotopy. We wish to prove that ψ is a homotopy equivalence.

Since e is an equivalence in C, the map ψ0 is a homotopy equivalence. It will therefore suﬃce to show
that ψ induces a homotopy equivalence after passing to the homotopy ﬁbers over any point of MapC(Z, Z) ≃
MapC(Z ′, Z). These homotopy ﬁbers can be identiﬁed with the homotopy ﬁbers of the vertical arrows in
the diagram

MapC(Y, Y )

MapC(X, Y )

MapC(Y, Z)

/ MapC(X, Z).

It will therefore suﬃce to show that this diagram (which commutes up to speciﬁed homotopy) is a homotopy
pullback. Unwinding the deﬁnition, this is equivalent to the assertion that f is left orthogonal to g, which
is part of the deﬁnition of a factorization system.

Lemma 5.2.8.20. Let K, A, and B be simplicial sets. Then the diagram

K × B

K × (A ⋆ B)

B

/ (K × A) ⋆ B

is a homotopy pushout square of simplicial sets (with respect to the Joyal model structure).

K × B

K × (A ⋄ B)

K × (A ⋆ B)

B

/ (K × A) ⋄ B

/ (K × A) ⋆ B.

The square on the left is a pushout square in which the horizontal maps are monomorphisms of simplicial
sets, and therefore a homotopy pushout square (since the Joyal model structure is left proper). The square
on the right is a homotopy pushout square, since the horizontal arrows are both categorical equivalences
(Proposition 4.2.1.2). It follows that the outer square is also a homotopy pushout, as desired.

Notation 5.2.8.21. In the arguments which follow, we let Q denote the simplicial subset of ∆3 spanned by
all simplices which do not contain ∆{1,2}. Note that Q is isomorphic to the product ∆1 × ∆1 as a simplicial
set.

Lemma 5.2.8.22. Let C be an ∞-category, and let σ : Q → C be a diagram, which we depict as

A

X

/ Y.

Then there is a canonical categorical equivalence

θ : Fun(∆3, C) ×Fun(Q,C) {σ} → MapCA/ /Y

(B, X)

In particular, Fun(∆3, C) ×Fun(Q,C) {σ} is a Kan complex.

Proof. We will identify MapCA/ /Y
for every simplicial set K, we have a pullback diagram of sets

(B, X) with the simplicial set Z deﬁned by the following universal property:

HomSet∆ (K, Z)

HomSet∆ (∆0 ⋆ (K × ∆1) ⋆ ∆0, C)

∆0

/ HomSet∆(∆0 ⋆ (K × ∂ ∆1) ⋆ ∆0, C).

The map θ is then induced by the natural transformation

K × ∆3 ≃ K × (∆0 ⋆ ∆1 ⋆ ∆0) → ∆0 ⋆ (K × ∆1) ⋆ ∆0.

We wish to prove that θ is a categorical equivalence. Since C is an ∞-category, it will suﬃce to show

that for every simplicial set K, the rightmost square of the diagram

K × (∆{0}

∆{3})

K × C

K × ∆3

`

∆{0}

∆{3}

/ ∆0 ⋆ (K × ∂ ∆1) ⋆ ∆0

/ ∆0 ⋆ (K × ∆1) ⋆ ∆0

is a homotopy pushout square (with respect to the Joyal model structure). For this we need only verify
that the left and outer squares are homotopy pushout diagrams, which follows from repeated application of
Lemma 5.2.8.20.

Proof of Proposition 5.2.8.17. We ﬁrst show that (1) ⇒ (2). Assume that (SL, SR) is a factorization system
on C. The map p : Fun′(∆2, C) → Fun(∆{0,2}, C) is obviously a categorical ﬁbration. It will therefore suﬃce
to show that p is a categorical equivalence.

Let D be the full subcategory of Fun(∆1 × ∆1, C) spanned by those diagrams of the form

f

g

/ Z

where f ∈ SL, g ∈ SR, and e is an equivalence in C. The map p factors as a composition

and p′′ is given by restriction to the left vertical edge of the diagram. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce
to show that p′ and p′′ are categorical equivalences.

We ﬁrst show that p′ is a categorical equivalence. The map p′ admits a left inverse q, given by composition
with an inclusion ∆2 ⊆ ∆1 × ∆1. We note that q is a pullback of the restriction map q′ : Fun′′(∆2, C) →
Fun(∆{0,2}, C), where Fun′′(∆2, C) is the full subcategory spanned by diagrams of the form

X

Z ′

 @@@@@@@@

e

/ Z

where e is an equivalence. Since q′ is a trivial Kan ﬁbration (Proposition 4.3.2.15), q is a trivial Kan ﬁbration,
so that p′ is a categorical equivalence as desired.

We now complete the proof by showing that p′′ is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. Let E denote the full subcategory
of Fun(∆1, C)×∆1 spanned by those pairs (g, i) where either i = 0 or g ∈ SR. The projection map r : E → ∆1
is a Cartesian ﬁbration associated to the inclusion Fun′(∆1, C) ⊆ Fun(∆1, C), where Fun′(∆1, C) is the full
subcategory spanned by the elements of SR. Using Lemma 5.2.8.19, we conclude that r is also a coCartesian
ﬁbration. Moreover, we can identify

D ⊆ Fun(∆1 × ∆1, C) ≃ Map∆1(∆1, E)

with the full subcategory spanned by the coCartesian sections of r. In terms of this identiﬁcation, p′′ is
given by evaluation at the initial vertex {0} ⊆ ∆1, and is therefore a trivial Kan ﬁbration as desired. This
completes the proof that (1) ⇒ (2).

have proved the following:

(∗) A morphism f of C belongs to SL if and only if sL(f ) is an equivalence in C.

It follows immediately from (∗) that SL is stable under the formation of retracts; similarly, SR is stable
under the formation of retracts. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that f ⊥ g whenever f ∈ SL
and g ∈ SR. Fix a commutative diagram σ :

4.3.2.15 twice, we deduce that the restriction functor Fun(∆2 × ∆1, C) → Fun(∆3, C) induces a trivial Kan

q : D ⊆ Fun(∆2 × ∆1, C) → Fun(∆{0,2} × ∆1, C).

5.2.9 Application: Automorphisms of Cat∞
In §1.2.1, we saw that for every ∞-category C, the opposite simplicial set Cop is again an ∞-category. We
will see below that the construction C 7→ Cop determines an equivalence from the ∞-category Cat∞ to itself.
In fact, this is essentially the only nontrivial self-equivalence of Cat∞. More precisely, we have the following
result due to To¨en (see [76]):

Theorem 5.2.9.1. Let E denote the full subcategory of Fun(Cat∞, Cat∞) spanned by the equivalences. Then
E is equivalent to the (nerve of the) discrete category {id, r}, where r : Cat∞ → Cat∞ is a functor which
associates to every ∞-category its opposite.

Our goal in this section is to give a proof of Theorem 5.2.9.1. We ﬁrst outline the basic strategy. Fix
an equivalence f from Cat∞ to itself. The ﬁrst step is to argue that f is determined by its restriction
to a reasonably small subcategory of Cat∞. To prove this, we will introduce the notion of a subcategory
C0 ⊆ C which strongly generates C (Deﬁnitions 5.2.9.2 and 5.2.9.6). We will then show that Cat∞ is strongly
generated by the subcategory consisting of nerves of partially ordered sets (in fact, it is generated by an even
smaller subcategory: see Theorem 5.2.9.9). This will allow us to reduce to the problem of understanding the
category of self-equivalences of the category of partially ordered sets, which is easy to tackle directly: see
Proposition 5.2.9.14.

We begin by introducing some deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 5.2.9.2. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories. We will say that f is strongly
generates the ∞-category D if the identity transformation id : f → f exhibits the identity functor idD as a
left Kan extension of f along f .

Remark 5.2.9.3. In other words, a functor f : C → D strongly generates the ∞-category D if and only
if, for every object D ∈ D, the evident diagram (C ×D D/D)⊲ → D⊲
/D → D exhibits D as a colimit of the
diagram (C ×D D/D) → C f
→ D . In particular, this implies that every object of D can be obtained as the
colimit of a diagram which factors through C. Moreover, if C is small and D is locally small, then the diagram
can be assumed small.

Remark 5.2.9.4. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories, where C is small, D is locally small,
and D admits small colimits. In view of Theorem 5.1.5.6, we may assume without loss of generality that f
factors as a composition

C j

→ P(C) F→ D,

where j denotes the Yoneda embedding and F preserves small colimits. Corollary 5.2.6.5 implies that F has
a right adjoint G, given by the composition

D j′

→ Fun(Dop, S)

◦f
→ P(C),

where j′ denotes the Yoneda embedding for D; moreover, the transformation

f = F ◦ j → (F ◦ (G ◦ F )) ◦ j ≃ (F ◦ G) ◦ f

307

(cid:15)
(cid:15)
/
(cid:15)
(cid:15)
/
exhibits (F ◦ G) as a left Kan extension of f along itself. It follows that f strongly generates D if and only
if the counit map F ◦ G → idD is an equivalence of functors. This is equivalent to the requirement that the
functor G is fully faithful.

In other words, the functor f : C → D strongly generates D if and only if the induced functor F : P(C) →
D exhibits D as a localization of P(C). In particular, the Yoneda embedding C → P(C) strongly generates
P(C), for any small ∞-category C.

Remark 5.2.9.5. Let f : C → D be as in Remark 5.2.9.4, and let E be an ∞-category which admits small
colimits. Let Fun0(D, E) denote the full subcategory of Fun(D, E) spanned by those functors which preserve
small colimits. Then composition with f induces a fully faithful functor Fun0(D, E) → Fun(C, E). This
follows from Theorem 5.1.5.6, Proposition 5.5.4.20, and Remark 5.2.9.4.

Deﬁnition 5.2.9.6. Let C be an ∞-category. We will say that a full subcategory C0 ⊆ C strongly generates
C if the inclusion functor C0 → C strongly generates C, in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.2.9.2.

Remark 5.2.9.7. In other words, C0 strongly generates C if and only if the identity functor idC is a left
Kan extension of idC | C0. It follows from Proposition 4.3.2.8 that if C0 ⊆ C1 ⊆ C are full subcategories and
C0 strongly generates C, then C1 also strongly generates C.

Example 5.2.9.8. The ∞-category S of spaces is strongly generated by its ﬁnal object; this follows imme-
diately from Remark 5.2.9.4.

The main ingredient in the proof of Theorem 5.2.9.1 is the following result, which is of interest in its own

right:

Theorem 5.2.9.9. The ∞-category Cat∞ is strongly generated by the full subcategory consisting of the
objects {∆n}n≥0.

Remark 5.2.9.10. It follows from Theorem 5.2.9.9 that the theory of ∞-categories can be obtained as a
suitable localization of the model category Fun(∆op, Set∆) of bisimplicial sets. It is possible to describe this
localization precisely: this leads to Rezk’s theory of complete Segal spaces, which is another model for the
theory of higher categories where every k-morphism is assumed to be invertible for k > 1. For more details,
we refer the reader to [64].

Proof of Theorem 5.2.9.9. We can identify the full subcategory in question with N(∆), the (nerve of) the
category of simplices. The fully faithful embedding f : N(∆) → Cat∞ can be extended (up to equivalence)
to a colimit-preserving functor F : P(N(∆)) → Cat∞, which admits a right adjoint G (this follows from
Corollary 5.5.2.9, but an explicit description will be given below). In view of Remark 5.2.9.4, it will suﬃce
to show that the unit transformation id → F ◦ G is an equivalence.

We now reformulate the desired conclusion in the language of model categories. We can identify Cat∞
with the underlying ∞-category A◦ of the simplicial model category A = Set+
∆ of marked simplicial sets,
with the Cartesian model structure described in §3.1. The diagram f is then obtained from a diagram
f : ∆ → A, given by the cosimplicial object [n] 7→ (∆n)♭. Since A is a simplicial model category (with
respect to the simplicial structure given by the formula X ⊗ K = X × K ♯), we can extend f to a colimit
preserving functor

F : Fun(∆op, Set∆) → A.
Here Fun(∆op, Set∆) can be identiﬁed with the category of bisimplicial sets. Since the cosimplicial object f ∈
Fun(∆, A) is Reedy coﬁbrant (see §A.2.9), the functor F is a left Quillen functor if we endow Fun(∆op, Set∆)
with the injective model structure (Example A.2.9.28). The functor F has a right adjoint G, given by the
formula

G(X)m,n = HomA((∆m)♭ × (∆n)♯, X).
This right adjoint induces a functor from A◦ to Fun(∆op, Set∆)◦, which (after passing to the simplicial
nerve) is equivalent to the functor G : Cat∞ → P(N(∆)) considered above. Consequently, it will suﬃce to

308

show that the counit map LF ◦ RG → idhA is an equivalence of functors, where LF and RG denote the left
and right derived functors of F and G, respectively. Since every object of Fun(∆op, Set∆) is coﬁbrant, we
can identify F with its left derived functor. We are therefore reduced to proving the following:

(∗) Let X = (X, M ) be a ﬁbrant object of the category A of marked simplicial sets. Then the counit map

ηX : F GX → X is a weak equivalence in A.

Since X is ﬁbrant, the simplicial set X is an ∞-category and M is the collection of all equivalences in X.
Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we can identify F GX with the marked simplicial set (Y, N ) described as follows:
(a) An n-simplex of Y is a map of simplicial sets ∆n × ∆n → X, which carries every morphism of {i} × ∆n

to an equivalence in C, for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.

(b) An edge ∆1 → Y belongs to N if and only if the corresponding map ∆1 × ∆1 → X factors through

the projection onto the second factor.

In terms of this identiﬁcation, the map ηX : (Y, N ) → (X, M ) is deﬁned on n-simplices by composing

with the diagonal map ∆n → ∆n × ∆n.

Let N ′ denote the collection of all edges of Y which correspond to maps from (∆1 × ∆1)♯ into X. The

map ηX factors as a composition

(Y, N ) i→ (Y, N ′)

η′
X→ (X, M ).

We claim that the map i is a weak equivalence of marked simplicial sets. To prove this, it will suﬃce to
show that for every edge α which belongs to N ′, there exists a 2-simplex σ :

This is possible because X 0 is a Kan complex and the left vertical map is a weak homotopy equivalence.
This completes the proof that i is a weak equivalence. By the two-out-of-three property, it will now suﬃce
to show that η′
X

: (Y, N ′) → (X, M ) is an equivalence of marked simplicial sets.

We now deﬁne maps R≤, R≥ : ∆1 × Y → Y as follows. Consider a map g : ∆n → ∆1 × Y , corresponding
g : ∆n × ∆n → X. We then deﬁne R≤ ◦ g to be the n-simplex of
g ◦ τ : ∆n × ∆n → X, where τ : ∆n × ∆n → ∆n × ∆n is deﬁned on vertices by

The map R≤ deﬁnes a homotopy from idY to an idempotent map r≤ : Y → Y . Similarly, R≥ deﬁnes a
homotopy from an idempotent map r≥ : Y → Y to the identity map idY . Let Y≤, Y≥ ⊆ Y denote the images

a deformation retract of (Y, N ′) in the category of marked simplicial sets. Similarly, the map R≥ exhibits

(Y≤ ∩ Y≥, N ′

is a weak equivalence of marked simplicial sets. We now complete the proof by observing that this composite
map is an isomorphism.

It follows from Remark 5.2.9.7 and Theorem 5.2.9.9 that Cat∞ is strongly generated by the full subcat-
egory spanned by those ∞-categories of the form N P , where P is a partially ordered set. Our next step is
to describe this subcategory in more intrinsic terms.

Proposition 5.2.9.11. Let C be an ∞-category. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The ∞-category C is equivalent to the nerve of a partially ordered set P .

(2) For every ∞-category D and every pair of functors F, F ′ : D → C such that F (x) ≃ F ′(x) for each

object x ∈ D, the functors F and F ′ are equivalent as objects of Fun(D, C).

(3) For every ∞-category D, the map of sets

π0 MapCat∞(D, C) → HomSet(π0 MapCat∞ (∆0, D), π0 MapCat∞ (∆0, C))

is injective.

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) is obvious, and (3) is just a restatement of (2). Assume (2); we will show
that (1) is satisﬁed. Let P denote the collection of equivalence classes of objects of C, where x ≤ y if the
space MapC(x, y) is nonempty. There is a canonical functor C → N P . To prove that this functor is an
equivalence, it will suﬃce to show the following:

(∗) For every pair of objects x, y ∈ C, the space MapC(x, y) is either empty or contractible.

310

To prove (∗), we may assume without loss of generality that C is the nerve of a ﬁbrant simplicial category
C. Let x and y be objects of C such that the Kan complex K = MapC(x, y) is nonempty. We deﬁne a new
(ﬁbrant) simplicial category D so that D consists of a pair of objects {x′, y′}, with

MapD(x′, x′) ≃ MapD(y′, y′) ≃ ∆0

MapD(x′, y′) ≃ K MapD(y′, x′) ≃ ∅.

: D → C be simplicial functors such that F (x′) = F

We let F , F
induces the identity map from MapD(x′, y′) = K = MapC(x, y) to itself, while F
induces a constant map
induce functors F and F ′ from N(D) to C. It follows from assumption (2)
from K to itself. Then F and F
that the functors F and F ′ are equivalent, which implies that the identity map from K to itself is homotopic
to a constant map; this proves that K is contractible.

(x′) = x, F (y′) = F

Corollary 5.2.9.12. Let σ : Cat∞ → Cat∞ be an equivalence of ∞-categories, and let C be an ∞-category
(which we regard as an object of Cat∞). Then C is equivalent to the nerve of a partially ordered set if and
only if σ(C) is equivalent to the nerve of a partially ordered set.

Lemma 5.2.9.13. Let σ, σ′ ∈ {id∆, r} ⊆ Fun(∆, ∆), where r denotes the reversal functor from ∆ to itself.
Then

HomFun(∆,∆)(σ, σ′) =

∅
{id}

(

if σ = σ′
if σ = σ′.

Proof. Note that σ and σ′ are both the identity at the level of objects. Let α : σ → σ′ be a natural
transformation. Then, for each n ≥ 0, α[n] is a map from [n] to itself. We claim that α[n] is given by the
formula

α[n](i) =

i
n − i

(

if σ = σ′
if σ 6= σ′.

To prove this, we observe that a choice of i ∈ [n] determines a map [0] → [n], which allows us to reduce to
the case n = 0 (where the result is obvious) by functoriality.

It follows from the above argument that the natural transformation α is uniquely determined, if it exists.
Moreover, α is a well-deﬁned natural transformation if and only if each α[n] is an order-preserving map from
[n] to itself; this is true if and only if σ = σ′.

Proposition 5.2.9.14. Let P denote the category of partially ordered sets, and let σ : P → P be an
equivalence of categories. Then σ is isomorphic either to the identity functor idP or the functor r which
carries every partially ordered set X to the same set with the opposite ordering.

Proof. Since σ is an equivalence of categories, it carries the ﬁnal object [0] ∈ P to itself (up to canonical
isomorphism). It follows that for every partially ordered set X, we have a canonical bijection of sets

ηX : X ≃ HomP([0], X) ≃ HomP(σ([0]), σ(X)) ≃ HomP([0], σ(X)) ≃ σ(X).

We next claim that σ([1]) is isomorphic to [1] as a partially ordered set. Since η[1] is bijective, the partially
ordered set σ([1]) has precisely two elements. Thus σ([1]) is isomorphic either to [1] or to a partially ordered
set {x, y} with two elements, neither larger than the other. In the second case, the set HomP(σ([1]), σ([1]))
has four elements. This is impossible, since σ is an equivalence of categories and HomP([1], [1]) has only
three elements. Let α : σ([1]) → [1] be an isomorphism (automatically unique, since the ordered set [1] has
no automorphisms in P).

The map α ◦ η[1] is a bijection from the set [1] to itself. We will assume that this map is the identity, and
prove that σ is isomorphic to the identity functor idP. The same argument, applied to σ ◦ r, will show that
if α ◦ η[1] is not the identity, then σ is isomorphic to r.

311

To prove that σ is equivalent to the identity functor, it will suﬃce to show that for every partially ordered
set X, the map ηX is an isomorphism of partially ordered sets. In other words, we must show that both ηX
and η−1
X are maps of partially ordered sets. We will prove that ηX is a map of partially ordered sets; the
same argument, applied to an inverse to the equivalence σ, will show that η−1
X is a map of partially ordered
sets. Let x, y ∈ X satisfy x ≤ y; we wish to prove that ηX (x) ≤ ηX (y) in σ(X). The pair (x, y) deﬁnes a
map of partially ordered sets [1] → X. By functoriality, we may replace X by [1], and thereby reduce to
the problem of proving that η[1] is a map of partially ordered sets. This follows from our assumption that
α ◦ η[1] is the identity map.

Proof of Theorem 5.2.9.1. Let C be the full subcategory of Cat∞ spanned by those ∞-categories which are
equivalent to the nerves of partially ordered sets, and let C0 denote the full subcategory of C spanned by the
objects {∆n}n≥0. Corollary 5.2.9.12 implies that every object σ ∈ E restricts to an equivalence from C to
itself. According to Proposition 5.2.9.14, σ| C is equivalent either to the identity functor, or to the restriction
r| C. In either case, we conclude that σ also induces an equivalence from C0 to itself.

Using Theorem 5.2.9.9 and Remark 5.2.9.5, we deduce that the restriction functor E → Fun(C0, C0) is
fully faithful. In particular, any object σ ∈ E is determined by the restriction σ| C, so that σ is equivalent to
either id or r by virtue of Proposition 5.2.9.14. Since C0 is equivalent to the nerve of the category ∆, Lemma
5.2.9.13 implies the existence of a fully faithful embedding from E to the nerve of the discrete category {id, r}.
To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that this functor is essentially surjective. In other words, we
must show that there exists a functor R : Cat∞ → Cat∞ whose restriction to C is equivalent to r.

∞ to itself; instead we have a canonical isomorphism MapCat∆

To carry out the details, it is convenient to replace Cat∞ by an equivalent ∞-category with a slightly more
elaborate deﬁnition. Recall that Cat∞ is deﬁned to be the simplicial nerve of a simplicial category Cat∆
∞,
(X, Y ) is the largest Kan complex contained in Fun(X, Y ).
whose objects are ∞-categories, where MapCat∆

nerve of Cat⊤
∞ is an ∞-category equipped with a canonical equivalence
Cat∞ → Cat′

5.3 ∞-Categories of Inductive Limits

Let C be a category. An Ind-object of C is a diagram f : I → C where I is a small ﬁltered category. We will
informally denote the Ind-object f by

[lim
−→

Xi]

where Xi = f (i). The collection of all Ind-objects of C forms a category, where the morphisms are given by
the formula

HomInd(C)([lim
−→

Xi], [lim
−→

Yj ]) = lim
←−

lim
−→

HomC(Xi, Yj).

We note that C may be identiﬁed with a full subcategory of Ind(C), corresponding to diagrams indexed by the
one-point category I = ∗. The idea is that Ind(C) is obtained from C by formally adjoining colimits of ﬁltered
diagrams. More precisely, Ind(C) may be described by the following universal property: for any category D
F : Ind(C) → D, whose
which admits ﬁltered colimits, and any functor F : C → D, there exists a functor
restriction to C is isomorphic to F , and which commutes with ﬁltered colimits. Moreover,
F is determined
up to (unique) isomorphism.

e

Example 5.3.0.1. Let C denote the category of ﬁnitely presented groups. Then Ind(C) is equivalent to
the category of groups. (More generally, one could replace “group” by any type of mathematical structure
described by algebraic operations which are required to satisfy equational axioms.)

e

Our objective in this section is to generalize the deﬁnition of Ind(C) to the case where C is an ∞-category.
If we were to work in the setting of simplicial (or topological) categories, we could apply the deﬁnition given
above directly. However, this leads to a number of problems:

(1) The construction of Ind-categories does not preserve equivalences between simplicial categories.

(2) The obvious generalization of the right hand side in equation above is given by

lim
←−

lim
−→

MapC(Xi, Yj).

While the relevant limits and colimits certainly exist in the category of simplicial sets, they are not
necessarily the correct objects: really one should replace the limit by a homotopy limit.

(3) In the higher-categorical setting, we should really allow the indexing diagram I to be a higher category
as well. While this does not result in any additional generality (Corollary 5.3.1.16), the restriction to
the diagrams indexed by ordinary categories is a technical inconvenience.

Although these diﬃculties are not insurmountable, it is far more convenient to proceed diﬀerently, using
the theory of ∞-categories. In §5.1, we showed that if C is a ∞-category, then P(C) can be interpreted as
an ∞-category which is freely generated by C under colimits. We might therefore hope to ﬁnd Ind(C) inside
of P(C), as a full subcategory. The problem, then, is to characterize this subcategory, and to prove that it
has the appropriate universal mapping property.

We will begin in §5.3.1, by introducing the deﬁnition of a ﬁltered ∞-category. Let C be a small ∞-category.
In §5.3.5, we will deﬁne Ind(C) to be the smallest full subcategory of P(C) which contains all representable
presheaves on C and is stable under ﬁltered colimits. There is also a more direct characterization of which
presheaves F : C → Sop belong to Ind(C): they are precisely the right exact functors, which we will study in
§5.3.2.

In §5.3.5, we will deﬁne the Ind-categories Ind(C) and study their properties. In particular, we will show

that morphism spaces in Ind(C) are computed by the naive formula

HomInd(C)([lim
−→

Xi], [lim
−→

Yj ]) = lim
←−

lim
−→

HomC(Xi, Yj).

Unwinding the deﬁnitions, this amounts to two conditions:

(1) The (Yoneda) embedding of j : C → Ind(C) is fully faithful (Proposition 5.1.3.1).

313

(2) For each object C ∈ C, the corepresentable functor

HomInd(C)(j(C), •)

commutes with ﬁltered colimits.

It is useful to translate condition (2) into a deﬁnition: an object D of an ∞-category D is said to be compact
if the functor D → S corepresented by D commutes with ﬁltered colimits. We will study this compactness
condition in §5.3.4.

One of our main results asserts that the ∞-category Ind(C) is obtained from C by freely adjoining colimits
of ﬁltered diagrams (Proposition 5.3.5.10). In §5.3.6, we will describe a similar construction in the case where
the class of ﬁltered diagrams has been replaced by any class of diagrams. We will revisit this idea in §5.5.8,
where we will study the ∞-category obtained from C by freely adjoining colimits of sifted diagrams.

5.3.1 Filtered ∞-Categories

Recall that a partially ordered set A is ﬁltered if every ﬁnite subset of A has an upper bound in A. Diagrams
indexed by directed partially ordered sets are extremely common in mathematics. For example, if A is the
set

of natural numbers, then a diagram indexed by A is a sequence

Z≥0 = {0, 1, . . .}

X0 → X1 → . . . .

The formation of direct limits for such sequences is one of the most basic constructions in mathematics.

In classical category theory, it is convenient to consider not only diagrams indexed by ﬁltered partially
ordered sets, but also more general diagrams indexed by ﬁltered categories. A category C is said to be ﬁltered
if it satisﬁes following conditions:

(1) For every ﬁnite collection {Xi} of objects of C, there exists an object X ∈ C equipped with morphisms

φi : Xi → X.

(2) Given any two morphisms f, g : X → Y in C, there exists a morphism h : Y → Z such that h◦f = h◦g.

Condition (1) is analogous to the requirement that any ﬁnite part of C admits an “upper bound”, while

condition (2) guarantees that the upper bound is unique in some asymptotic sense.

If we wish to extend the above deﬁnition to the ∞-categorical setting, it is natural to strengthen the

second condition.

Deﬁnition 5.3.1.1. Let C be a topological category. We will say that C is ﬁltered if it satisﬁes the following
conditions:

(1′) For every ﬁnite set {Xi} of objects of C, there exists an object X ∈ C and morphisms φi : Xi → X.

(2′) For every pair X, Y ∈ C of objects of C, every nonnegative integer n ≥ 0, and every continuous map
Sn → MapC(X, Y ), there exists a morphism Y → Z such that the induced map Sn → MapC(X, Z) is
nullhomotopic.

Remark 5.3.1.2. It is easy to see that an ordinary category C is ﬁltered in the usual sense if and only if it
is ﬁltered when regarded as a topological category with discrete mapping spaces. Conversely, if C is a ﬁltered
topological category, then its homotopy category hC is ﬁltered (when viewed as an ordinary category).

Remark 5.3.1.3. Condition (2′) of Deﬁnition 5.3.1.1 is a reasonable analogue of condition (2) in the
deﬁnition of a ﬁltered category. In the special case n = 0, condition (2′) asserts that any pair of morphisms
f, g : X → Y become homotopic after composition with some map Y → Z.

314

Remark 5.3.1.4. Topological spheres Sn need not play any distinguished role in the deﬁnition of a ﬁltered
topological category. Condition (2′) is equivalent to the following apparently stronger condition:

(2′′) For every pair X, Y ∈ C of objects of C, every ﬁnite cell complex K, and every continuous map
K → MapC(X, Y ), there exists a morphism Y → Z such that the induced map K → MapC(X, Z) is
nullhomotopic.

Remark 5.3.1.5. The condition that a topological category C be ﬁltered depends only on the homotopy
category hC, viewed as a H-enriched category. Consequently if F : C → C′ is an equivalence of topological
categories, then C is ﬁltered if and only if C′ is ﬁltered.

Remark 5.3.1.6. Deﬁnition 5.3.1.1 has an obvious analogue for (ﬁbrant) simplicial categories: one simply
replaces the topological n-sphere Sn by the simplicial n-sphere ∂ ∆n. It is easy to see that a topological
category C is ﬁltered if and only if the simplicial category Sing C is ﬁltered. Similarly, a (ﬁbrant) simplicial
category D is ﬁltered if and only if the topological category | D | is ﬁltered.

We now wish to study the analogue of Deﬁnition 5.3.1.1 in the setting of ∞-categories.

It will be

convenient to introduce a slightly more general notion:

Deﬁnition 5.3.1.7. Let κ be a regular cardinal, and let C be a ∞-category. We will say that C is κ-ﬁltered
if, for every κ-small simplicial set K and every map f : K → C, there exists a map f : K ⊲ → C extending
f . (In other words, C is κ-ﬁltered if it has the extension property with respect to the inclusion K ⊆ K ⊲, for
every κ-small simplicial set K.)

We will say that C is ﬁltered if it is ω-ﬁltered.

Example 5.3.1.8. Let C be the nerve of a partially ordered set A. Then C is κ-ﬁltered if and only if every
κ-small subset of A has an upper bound in A.

Remark 5.3.1.9. One may rephrase Deﬁnition 5.3.1.7 as follows: an ∞-category C is κ-ﬁltered if and only
if, for every diagram p : K → C, where K is κ-small, the slice ∞-category Cp/ is nonempty. Let q : C → C′
be a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories. Proposition 1.2.9.3 asserts that the induced map Cp/ → C′
q◦p/
is a categorical equivalence. Consequently Cp/ is nonempty if and only if C′
q◦p/ is nonempty. It follows that
C is κ-ﬁltered if and only if C′ is κ-ﬁltered.

Remark 5.3.1.10. An ∞-category C is κ-ﬁltered if and only if, for every κ-small partially ordered set A,
C has the right lifting property with respect to the inclusion N(A) ⊆ N(A)⊲ ≃ N(A ∪ {∞}). The “only if”
direction is obvious. For the converse, we observe that for every κ-small diagram p : K → C, the ∞-category
Cp/ is equivalent to Cq/, where q denotes the composition K ′′ p′
p
→ C. Here K ′′ is the second barycentric
subdivision of K and p′ is the map described in Variant 4.2.3.15. We now observe that K ′′ is equivalent to
the nerve of a κ-small partially ordered set.

→ K

Remark 5.3.1.11. We will say that an arbitrary simplicial set S is κ-ﬁltered if there exists a categorical
equivalence j : S → C, where C is a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category. In view of the Remark 5.3.1.9, this condition is
independent of the choice of j.

Our next major goal is to prove Proposition 5.3.1.13, which asserts that an ∞-category C is ﬁltered if

and only if the associated topological category | C[C]| is ﬁltered. First, we need a lemma.

Lemma 5.3.1.12. Let C be an ∞-category. Then C is ﬁltered if and only if it has the right extension
property with respect to every inclusion ∂ ∆n ⊆ Λn+1

n+1, n ≥ 0.

Proof. The “only if” direction is clear: we simply take K = ∂ ∆n in Deﬁnition 5.3.1.7. For the converse, let
us suppose that the assumption of Deﬁnition 5.3.1.7 is satisﬁed whenever K is the boundary of a simplex;
we must then show that it remains satisﬁed for any K which has only ﬁnitely many nondegenerate simplices.

315

We work by induction on the dimension of K, and then by the number of nondegenerate simplices of K.
If K is empty, there is nothing to prove (since it is the boundary of a 0-simplex). Otherwise, we may write
K = K ′

∂ ∆n ∆n, where n is the dimension of K.

Choose a map p : K → C; we wish to show that p may be extended to a map

p : K ⋆ {y} → C. We
ﬁrst consider the restriction p|K ′; by the inductive hypothesis it admits an extension q : K ′ ⋆ {x} → C. The
restriction q| ∂ ∆n ⋆ {x} together with p|∆n assemble to give a map

By assumption, the map r admits an extension

s : (K ′ ⋆ {x})

denote the result of amalgamating r with

p. We note that the inclusion

is a pushout of

(K ′ ⋆ {x})

(∂ ∆n ⋆ {x} ⋆ {y}) ⊆ K ′ ⋆ {x} ⋆ {y},

and therefore a categorical equivalence by Lemma 2.4.3.1. It follows that s admits an extension

(∆n ⋆ {y}) → C,

Proposition 5.3.1.13. Let C be a topological category. Then C is ﬁltered if and only if the ∞-category N(C)
is ﬁltered.

e

e

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that N(C) is ﬁltered. We verify conditions (1′) and (2′) of Deﬁnition 5.3.1.1:

(1′) Let {Xi}i∈I be a ﬁnite collection of objects of C, corresponding to a map p : I → N(C), where I is
p : I ⋆ {x} → N(C),

regarded as a discrete simplicial set. If N(C) is ﬁltered, then p extends to a map
corresponding to an object X = p(x) equipped with maps Xi → X in C.

(2′) Let X, Y ∈ C be objects, n ≥ 0, and Sn → MapC(X, Y ) a map. We note that this data may be
identiﬁed with a topological functor F : | C[K]| → C, where K is the simplicial set obtained from
∂ ∆n+2 by collapsing the initial face ∆n+1 to a point. If N(C) is ﬁltered, then F extends to a functor
F
deﬁned on | C[K ⋆ {z}]|; this gives an object Z =
F (z) and a morphism Y → Z such that the induced
map Sn → MapC(X, Z) is nullhomotopic.
e

e

e
For the converse, let us suppose that C is ﬁltered. We wish to show that N(C) is ﬁltered. By Lemma
5.3.1.12, it will suﬃce to prove that N(C) has the extension property with respect to the inclusion ∂ ∆n ⊆
Λn+1
n+1, for each n ≥ 0. Equivalently, it suﬃces to show that C has the right extension property with respect
to the inclusion | C[∂ ∆n]| ⊆ | C[Λn+1
n+1]|. If n = 0, this is simply the assertion that C is nonempty; if n = 1,
this is the assertion that for any pair of objects X, Y ∈ C there exists an object Z equipped with morphisms
X → Z, Y → Z. Both of these conditions follow from part (1) of Deﬁnition 5.3.1.1; we may therefore assume
that n > 1.

A0 ⊆ A1 ⊆ A2 ⊆ A3 .

We will make use of the description of A3 given in Remark 1.1.5.2: its objects are integers i satisfying
0 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, with MapA3(i, j) given by the cube of all functions p : {i, . . . , j} → [0, 1] satisfying p(i) =
p(j) = 1 for i ≤ j, andHomA3 (i, j) = ∅ for j < i. Composition is given by amalgamation of functions.

We note that A1 and A2 are subcategories of A3 having the same objects, where:

• MapA1 (i, j) = MapA2(i, j) = MapA3(i, j) unless i = 0 and j ∈ {n, n + 1}.
• MapA1 (0, n) = MapA2 (0, n) is the boundary of the cube MapA3 (0, n) = [0, 1]n−1.

• MapA1 (0, n + 1) consists of all functions p : [n + 1] → [0, 1] satisfying p(0) = p(n + 1) = 1 and

(∃i)[(1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1) ∧ p(i) ∈ {0, 1}].

• MapA2 (0, n+1) is the union of MapA1(0, n+1) with the collection of functions p : {0, . . . , n+1} → [0, 1]

satisfying p(0) = p(n) = p(n + 1) = 1.

Finally, we note that A0 is the full subcategory of A1 (or A2) whose set of objects is {0, . . . , n}.
We wish to show that any topological functor F : A0 → C can be extended to a functor

F : A2 → C.
Let X = F (0), Y = F (n). Then F induces a map Sn−1 ≃ MapA0 (0, n) → MapC(X, Y ). Since C is ﬁltered,
there exists a map φ : Y → Z such that the induced map f : Sn−1 → MapC(X, Z) is nullhomotopic.

e

Now set

F (n + 1) = Z; for p ∈ MapA1 (i, n + 1), we set

F (p) = φ ◦ F (q), where q ∈ MapA1(i, n) is such
that q|{i, . . . , n − 1} = p|{i, . . . , n − 1}. Finally, we note that the assumption that f is nullhomotopic allows
us to extend

e
F from MapA1(0, n + 1) to the whole of MapA2(0, n + 1).

Remark 5.3.1.14. Suppose that C is a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category, and let K be a simplicial set which is categor-
ically equivalent to a κ-small simplicial set. Then C has the extension property with respect to the inclusion
K ⊆ K ⊲. This follows from Proposition A.2.3.1: to test whether or not a map K → S extends over K ⊲, it
suﬃces to check in the homotopy category of Set∆ (with respect to the Joyal model structure), where we
may replace K by an equivalent κ-small simplicial set.

Proposition 5.3.1.15. Let C be a ∞-category with a ﬁnal object. Then C is κ-ﬁltered for every regular
cardinal κ. Conversely, if C is κ-ﬁltered and there exists a categorical equivalence K → C, where K is a
κ-small simplicial set, then C has a ﬁnal object.

Proof. We remark that C has a ﬁnal object if and only if there exists a retraction r of C⊲ onto C.
If C
is κ-ﬁltered and categorically equivalent to a κ-small simplicial set, then the existence of such a retraction
follows from Remark 5.3.1.14. On the other hand, if the retraction r exists, then any map p : K → C admits
an extension K ⊲ → C: one merely considers the composition K ⊲ → C⊲ r→ C .

A useful observation from classical category theory is that, if we are only interested in using ﬁltered
categories to index colimit diagrams, then in fact we do not need the notion of a ﬁltered category at all: we
can work instead with diagrams indexed by ﬁltered partially ordered sets. We now prove an ∞-categorical
analogue of this statement.

Proposition 5.3.1.16. Suppose that C is a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category. Then there exists a κ-ﬁltered partially
ordered set A and a coﬁnal map N(A) → C.

Proof. The proof uses the ideas introduced in §4.2.3, and in particular Proposition 4.2.3.8. Let X be a set
of size ≥ κ, and regard X as a category with a unique isomorphism between any pair of objects. We note
that N(X) is a contractible Kan complex; consequently the projection C × N(X) → C is coﬁnal. Hence, it
suﬃces to produce a coﬁnal map N(A) → C × N(X) with the desired properties.

317

Let {Kα}α∈A be the collection of all simplicial subsets of K = C × N(X) which are κ-small and possess
a ﬁnal vertex. Regard A as a partially ordered by inclusion. We ﬁrst claim that A is κ-ﬁltered and that
α∈A Kα = K. To prove both of these assertions, it suﬃces to show that any κ-small simplicial subset

L ⊆ K is contained in a κ-small simplicial subset L′ which has a ﬁnal vertex.
S

Since C is κ-ﬁltered, the composition

L → C × N(X) → C

extends to a map p : L⊲ → C. Since X has cardinality ≥ κ, there exists an element x ∈ X which is not in
p : L⊲ → K which extends the inclusion L ⊆ K × N(X)
the image of L0 → N (X)0 = X. Lift p to a map
p is injective, so that we
and carries the cone point to the element x ∈ X = N (X)0. It is easy to see that
may regard L⊲ as a simplicial subset of K × N(X). Moreover, it is clearly κ-small and has a ﬁnal vertex, as
desired.

e

Now regard A as a category, and let F : A → (Set∆)/K be the functor which carries each α ∈ A to the
simplicial set Kα. For each α ∈ A, choose a ﬁnal vertex xα of Kα. Let KF be deﬁned as in §4.2.3. We claim
next that there exists a retraction r : KF → K with the property that r(Xα) = xα for each I ∈ I.

e

The construction of r proceeds as in the proof of Proposition 4.2.3.4. Namely, we well-order the ﬁnite
B by induction on B. Moreover, we will select r so that it
B) ⊆ Kβ.

linearly ordered subsets B ⊆ A, and deﬁne r|K ′
has the property that if B is nonempty with largest element β, then r(K ′

If B is empty, then r|K ′

B = r|K is the identity map. Otherwise, B has a least element α and a largest
element β. We are required to construct a map Kα ⋆ ∆B → Kβ, or a map rB : ∆B → Kid |Kα/, where the
values of this map on ∂ ∆B have already been determined. If B is a singleton, we deﬁne this map to carry
the vertex ∆B to a ﬁnal object of Kid |Kα/ lying over xβ. Otherwise, we are guaranteed that some extension
exists by the fact that rB| ∂ ∆B carries the ﬁnal vertex of ∆B to a ﬁnal object of Kid |Kα/.

Now let j : N(A) → K denote the restriction of the retraction of r to N(A). Using Propositions 4.2.3.4

and 4.2.3.8, we deduce that j is a coﬁnal map as desired.

A similar technique can be used to prove the following characterization of κ-ﬁltered ∞-categories:

Proposition 5.3.1.17. Let S be a simplicial set. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The simplicial set S is κ-ﬁltered.

(2) There exists a diagram of simplicial sets {Yα}α∈I having colimit Y and a categorical equivalence S → Y ,

where each Yα is κ-ﬁltered and the indexing category I is κ-ﬁltered.

(3) There exists a categorical equivalence S → C where C is a κ-ﬁltered union of simplicial subsets Cα ⊆ C

such that each Cα is an ∞-category with a ﬁnal object.

Proof. Let T : Set∆ → Set∆ be the “ﬁbrant replacement” functor given by

T (X) = N(| C[X]|).

There is a natural transformation jX : X → T (X) which is a categorical equivalence every simplicial set X
the map jX is a categorical equivalence. Moreover, each T (X) is an ∞-category. Furthermore, the functor
T preserves inclusions and commutes with ﬁltered colimits.

It is clear that (3) implies (2). Suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Replacing the diagram {Yα}α∈I by
{T (Yα)}α∈I if necessary, we may suppose that each Yα is an ∞-category. It follows that Y is an ∞-category.
If p : K → Y is a diagram indexed by a κ-small simplicial set, then p factors through a map pα : K → Yα
for some α ∈ I, in virtue of the assumption that I is κ-ﬁltered. Since Yα is a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category, we can
ﬁnd an extension K ⊲ → Yα of pα, hence an extension K ⊲ → Y of p.

Now suppose that (1) is satisﬁed. Replacing S by T (S) if necessary, we may suppose that S is an ∞-
category. Choose a set X of cardinality ≥ κ, and let N(X) be deﬁned as in the proof of Proposition 5.3.1.16.
The proof of Proposition 5.3.1.16 shows that we may write S × N(X) as a κ-ﬁltered union of simplicial
subsets {Yα}, where each Yα has a ﬁnal vertex. We now take C = T (S × N(X)), and let Cα = T (Yα): these
choices satisfy (3), which completes the proof.

318

By deﬁnition, a ∞-category C is κ-ﬁltered if any map p : K → C, whose source K is κ-small, extends
over the cone K ⊲. We now consider the possibility of constructing this extension uniformly in p. First, we
need a few lemmas.

Lemma 5.3.1.18. Let C be a ﬁltered ∞-category. Then C is weakly contractible.

Proof. Since C is ﬁltered, it is nonempty. Fix an object C ∈ C. Let | C | denote the geometric realization of
C as a simplicial set. We identify C with a point of the topological space | C |. By Whitehead’s theorem,
to show that C is weakly contractible, it suﬃces to show that for every i ≥ 0, the homotopy set πi(| C |, C)
consists of a single point. If not, we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite simplicial subset K ⊆ C containing C such that the map
f : πi(|K|, C) → πi(| C |, C) has nontrivial image. But C is ﬁltered, so the inclusion K ⊆ C factors through
a map K ⊲ → C. It follows that f factors through πi(|K ⊲|, C). But this homotopy set is trivial, since K ⊲ is
weakly contractible.

Lemma 5.3.1.19. Let C be a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a diagram indexed by a κ-small
simplicial set K. Then Cp/ is κ-ﬁltered.

Proof. Let K ′ be a κ-small simplicial set, and p′ : K ′ → Cp/ a κ-small diagram. Then we may identify
p′ with a map q : K ⋆ K ′ → C, and we get an isomorphism (Cp/)p′/ ≃ Cq/. Since K ⋆ K ′ is κ-small, the
∞-category Cq/ is nonempty.

Proposition 5.3.1.20. Let C be an ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. Then C is κ-ﬁltered if and only
if, for each κ-small simplicial set K, the diagonal map d : C → Fun(K, C) is coﬁnal.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that the diagonal map d : C → Fun(K, C) is coﬁnal, for any κ-small simplicial set K.
Choose any map j : K → C; we wish to show that j can be extended to K ⊲. By Proposition A.2.3.1, it
suﬃces to show that j can be extended to the equivalent simplicial set K ⋄ ∆0. In other words, we must
produce an object C ∈ C and a morphism j → d(C) in Fun(K, C).
It will suﬃce to prove that the ∞-
category D = C ×Fun(K,C) Fun(K, C)j/ is nonempty. We now invoke Theorem 4.1.3.1 to deduce that D is
weakly contractible.

Now suppose that S is κ-ﬁltered, and that K is a κ-small simplicial set. We wish to show that the
diagonal map d : C → Fun(K, C) is coﬁnal. By Theorem 4.1.3.1, it suﬃces to prove that for every object
X ∈ Fun(K, C), the ∞-category Fun(K, C)X/ ×Fun(K,C) C is weakly contractible. But if we identify X with
a map x : K → C, then we get a natural identiﬁcation

which is κ-ﬁltered by Lemma 5.3.1.19 and therefore weakly contractible by Lemma 5.3.1.18.

Fun(K, C)X/ ×Fun(K,C) C ≃ Cx/,

5.3.2 Right Exactness

Let A and B be abelian categories. In classical homological algebra, a functor F : A → B is said to be right
exact if it is additive, and whenever

A′ → A → A′′ → 0

is an exact sequence in A, the induced sequence

F (A′) → F (A) → F (A′′) → 0

is exact in B.

The notion of right exactness generalizes in a natural way to functors between categories which are not
assumed to be abelian. Let F : A → B be a functor between abelian categories, as above. Then F is
additive if and only if F preserves ﬁnite coproducts. Furthermore, an additive functor F is right exact if
and only if it preserves coequalizer diagrams. Since every ﬁnite colimit can be built out of ﬁnite coproducts

319

and coequalizers, right exactness is equivalent to the requirement that F preserves all ﬁnite colimits. This
condition makes sense whenever the category A admits ﬁnite colimits.

It is possible to generalize even further, to the case of a functor between arbitrary categories. To simplify
the discussion, let us suppose that B = Setop. Then we may regard a functor F : A → B as a presheaf
of sets on the category A. Using this presheaf we can deﬁne a new category AF , whose objects are pairs
(A, η) where A ∈ A and η ∈ F (A), and morphisms from (A, η) to (A′, η′) are maps f : A → A′ such that
f ∗(η′) = η, where f ∗ denotes the induced map F (A′) → F (A). If A admits ﬁnite colimits, then the functor
F preserves ﬁnite colimits if and only if the category AF is ﬁltered.

Our goal in this section is to adapt the notion of right-exact functors to the ∞-categorical context. We

begin with the following:

Deﬁnition 5.3.2.1. Let F : A → B be a functor between ∞-categories and κ a regular cardinal. We will say
that F is κ-right exact if, for any right ﬁbration B′ → B where B′ is κ-ﬁltered, the ∞-category A′ = A ×B B′
is also κ-ﬁltered. We will say that F is right exact if it is ω-right exact.

Remark 5.3.2.2. We also have an evident dual notion of left exact functor.

Remark 5.3.2.3. If A admits ﬁnite colimits, then a functor F : A → B is right exact if and only if F
preserves ﬁnite colimits (see Proposition 5.3.2.9 below).

We note the following basic stability properties of κ-right exact maps.

Proposition 5.3.2.4. Let κ be a regular cardinal.

(1) If F : A → B and G : B → C are κ-right exact functors between ∞-categories, then G ◦ F : A → C is

κ-right exact.

(2) Any equivalence of ∞-categories is κ-right exact.

(3) Let F : A → B be a κ-right exact functor, and let F ′ : A → B be homotopic to F . Then F ′ is κ-right

exact.

Proof. Property (1) is immediate from the deﬁnition. We will establish (2) and (3) as a consequence of the
following more general assertion: if F : A → B and G : B → C are functors such that F is a categorical
equivalence, then G is κ-right exact if and only if G ◦ F is κ-right exact. To prove this, let C′ → C be a right
ﬁbration. Proposition 3.3.1.3 implies that the induced map

A′ = A ×C C′ → B ×C C′ = B′

is a categorical equivalence. Thus A′ is κ-ﬁltered if and only if B′ is κ-ﬁltered.

We now deduce (2) by specializing to the case where G is the identity map. To prove (3), we choose a
contractible Kan complex K containing a pair of vertices {x, y} and a map g : K → BA with g(x) = F ,
g(y) = F ′. Applying the above argument to the composition

A ≃ A ×{x} ⊆ A ×K G→ B,

we deduce that G is κ-right exact. Applying the converse to the diagram

A ≃ A ×{y} ⊆ A ×K G→ B

we deduce that F ′ is κ-right exact.

The next result shows that the κ-right exactness of a functor F : A → B can be tested on a very small

collection of right ﬁbrations B′ → B.

Proposition 5.3.2.5. Let F : A → B be a functor between ∞-categories and κ a regular cardinal. The
following are equivalent:

320

(1) The functor F is κ-right exact.

(2) For every object B of B, the ∞-category A ×B B/B is κ-ﬁltered.

Proof. We observe that for every object B ∈ B, the ∞-category B/B is right-ﬁbered over B and is κ-
ﬁltered (since it has a ﬁnal object). Consequently, (1) implies (2). Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Let
T : (Set∆)/ B → (Set∆)/ B denote the composite functor

(Set∆)/ B

StB→ (Set∆)C[Bop] Sing |•|

→ (Set∆)C[Bop] UnB→ (Set∆)/ B.

We will use the following properties of T :

(i) There is a natural transformation jX : X → T (X), where jX is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/ B

for every X ∈ (Set∆)/ B.

(ii) For every X ∈ (Set∆)/ B, the associated map T (X) → B is a right ﬁbration.

(iii) The functor T commutes with ﬁltered colimits.

We will say that an object X ∈ (Set∆)/ B is good if the ∞-category T (X) ×B A is κ-ﬁltered. We now make
the following observations:

(A) If X → Y is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/ B, then X is good if and only if if Y is good. This
follows from the fact that T (X) → T (Y ) is an equivalence of right ﬁbrations, so that the induced
map T (X) ×B A → T (Y ) ×B A is an equivalence of right ﬁbrations and consequently a categorical
equivalence of ∞-categories.

(B) If X → Y is a categorical equivalence in (Set∆)/ B, then X is good if and only if Y is good. This

follows (A), since every categorical equivalence is a contravariant equivalence.

(C) The collection of good objects of (Set∆)B is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits. This follows from the fact
that the functor X 7→ T (X) ×B A commutes with κ-ﬁltered colimits (in fact, with all ﬁltered colimits)
and Proposition 5.3.1.17.

(D) If X ∈ (Set∆)/ B corresponds to a right ﬁbration X → B, then X is good if and only if X ×B A is

κ-ﬁltered.

(E) For every object B ∈ B, the overcategory B/B is a good object of (Set∆)/ B. In view of (D), this is

equivalent to the assumption (2).

(F ) If X consists of a single vertex x, then X is good. To see this, let B ∈ B denote the image of X. The
natural map X → B/B can be identiﬁed with the inclusion of a ﬁnal vertex; this map is right anodyne
and therefore a contravariant equivalence. We now conclude by applying (A) and (E).

(G) If X ∈ (Set∆)/ B is an ∞-category with a ﬁnal object x, then X is good. To prove this, we note that
{x} is good by (F ) and the inclusion {x} ⊆ X is right anodyne, hence a contravariant equivalence. We
conclude by applying (A).

(H) If X ∈ (Set∆)/ B is κ-ﬁltered, then X is good. To prove this, we apply Proposition 5.3.1.17 to deduce
the existence of a categorical equivalence i : X → C, where C is a κ-ﬁltered union of ∞-categories
with ﬁnal objects. Replacing C by C ×K if necessary, where K is a contractible Kan complex, we may
suppose that i is a coﬁbration. Since B is an ∞-category, the lifting problem

has a solution. Thus we may regard C as an object of (Set∆)/ B. According to (B), it suﬃces to show
that C is good. But C is a κ-ﬁltered colimit of good objects of (Set∆)B (by (G)), and is therefore itself
good (by (C)).

Now let B′ → B be a right ﬁbration, where B′ is κ-ﬁltered. By (H), B′ is a good object of (Set∆)/ B.

Applying (D), we deduce that A′ = B′ ×B A is κ-ﬁltered. This proves (1).

Our next goal is to prove Proposition 5.3.2.9, which gives a very concrete characterization of right
exactness under the assumption that there is a suﬃcient supply of colimits. We ﬁrst need a few preliminary
results.

Lemma 5.3.2.6. Let B′ → B be a Cartesian ﬁbration. Suppose that B has an initial object B and that B′
is ﬁltered. Then the ﬁber B′

B = B′ ×B{B} is a contractible Kan complex.

Proof. Since B is an initial object of B, the inclusion {B}op ⊆ Bop is coﬁnal. Proposition 4.1.2.14 implies
B)op ⊆ (B′)op is also coﬁnal, and therefore a weak homotopy equivalence. It now suﬃces
that the inclusion (B′
to prove that B′ is weakly contractible, which follows from Lemma 5.3.1.18.

Lemma 5.3.2.7. Let f : A → B be a right exact functor between ∞-categories, and let A ∈ A be an initial
object. Then f (A) is an initial object of B.
Proof. Let B be an object of B. Proposition 5.3.2.5 implies that A′ = B/B ×B A is ﬁltered. We may identify
MapB(f (A), B) with the ﬁber of the right ﬁbration A′ → A over the object A. We now apply Lemma 5.3.2.6
to deduce that MapB(f (A), B) is contractible.

Lemma 5.3.2.8. Let κ be a regular cardinal, f : A → B a κ-right exact functor between ∞-categories, and
p : K → A be a diagram indexed by a κ-small simplicial set K. The induced map Ap/ → Bf p/ is κ-right
exact.

Proof. According to Proposition 5.3.2.5, it suﬃces to prove that for each object B ∈ Bf ◦p/, the ∞-category
A′ = Ap/ ×Bf p/ (Bf p/)/B is κ-ﬁltered. Let B denote the image of B in B, and let q : K ′ → A′ be a diagram
indexed by a κ-small simplicial set K ′; we wish to show that q admits an extension to K ′⊲. We may regard
p and q together as deﬁning a diagram K ⋆ K ′ → A ×B B/B. Since f is κ-ﬁltered, we can extend this to a
map (K ⋆ K ′)⊲ → A ×B B/B, which can be identiﬁed with an extension q : K ′⊲ → A′ of q.

Proposition 5.3.2.9. Let f : A → B be a functor between ∞-categories and let κ be a regular cardinal.

(1) If f is κ-right exact, then f preserves all κ-small colimits which exist in A.

(2) Conversely, if A admits κ-small colimits and f preserves κ-small colimits, then f is right exact.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that f is κ-right exact. Let K be a κ-small simplicial set, and let p : K ⊲ → A be a
colimit of p = p|K. We wish to show that f ◦ p is a colimit diagram. Using Lemma 5.3.2.8, we may replace
A by Ap/ and B by Bf p/, and thereby reduce to the case K = ∅. We are then reduced to proving that f
preserves initial objects, which follows from Lemma 5.3.2.7.

Now suppose that A admits κ-small colimits, and that f preserves κ-small colimits. We wish to prove
that f is κ-right exact. Let B be an object of B and set A′ = A ×B B/B. We wish to prove that A′ is
κ-ﬁltered. Let p′ : K → A′ be a diagram indexed by a κ-small simplicial set K; we wish to prove that p′
extends to a map p′ : K ⊲ → A′. Let p : K → A be the composition of p′ with the projection A′ → A, and
let p : K ⊲ → A be a colimit of p. We may identify f ◦ p and p′ with objects of Bf p/. Since f preserves
κ-small colimits, f ◦ p is an initial object of Bf p/, so that there exists a morphism α : f ◦ p → p′ in Bf ◦p/.
The morphism α can be identiﬁed with the desired extension p′ : K ⊲ → A′.

Remark 5.3.2.10. The results of this section all dualize in an evident way: a functor G : A → B is said to
be κ-left exact if the induced functor Gop : Aop → Bop is κ-right exact. In the case where A admits κ-small
limits, this is equivalent to the requirement that G preserves κ-small limits.

Remark 5.3.2.11. Let C be an ∞-category, and let F : C → Sop be a functor, and let
C → C be the
associated right ﬁbration (the pullback of the universal right ﬁbration Q0 → Sop). If F is κ-right exact,
C is κ-ﬁltered (since Q0 has a ﬁnal object). If C admits κ-small colimits, then the converse holds: if
then
C is κ-ﬁltered, then F preserves κ-small colimits by Proposition 5.3.5.3, and is therefore κ-right exact by
Proposition 5.3.2.5. The converse does not hold in general: it is possible to give an example of right ﬁbration
C → C such that

C is ﬁltered, yet the classifying functor F : C → Sop is not right exact.

indexing diagrams in other categories. This is because the colimits of ﬁltered diagrams enjoy certain exactness
properties which are not shared by colimits in general. In this section, we will formulate and prove these
exactness properties in the ∞-categorical setting. First, we need a few deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 5.3.3.1. Let κ be a regular cardinal. We will say that an ∞-category C is κ-closed if every
diagram p : K → C indexed by a κ-small simplicial set K admits a colimit p : K ⊲ → C.

In a κ-closed ∞-category, it is possible to construct κ-small colimits functorially. More precisely, suppose
that C is an ∞-category and that K is a simplicial set with the property that every diagram p : K → C has a
colimit in C. Let D denote the full subcategory of Fun(K ⊲, C) spanned by the colimit diagrams. Proposition
4.3.2.15 implies that the restriction functor D → Fun(K, C) is a trivial ﬁbration.
It therefore admits a
section s (which is unique up to a contractible ambiguity). Let e : Fun(K ⊲, C) → C be the functor given by
evaluation at the cone point of K ⊲. We will refer to the composition

Fun(K, C) s→ D ⊆ Fun(K ⊲, C) e→ C

as a colimit functor; it associates to each diagram p : K → C a colimit of p in C. We will generally denote
colimit functors by lim

: Fun(K, C) → C.

−→K

Lemma 5.3.3.2. Let F ∈ Fun(K, S) be a corepresentable functor (that is, F lies in the essential image of
the Yoneda embedding K op → Fun(K, S)), and let X ∈ S be a colimit of F . Then X is contractible.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that K is an ∞-category. Let
classiﬁed by F . Since F is corepresentable,
Corollary 3.3.4.6 implies that there is an isomorphism
also contractible.

Proposition 5.3.3.3. Let κ be a regular cardinal and let I be an ∞-category. The following conditions are
equivalent:

e

(1) The ∞-category I is κ-ﬁltered.

(2) The colimit functor lim

−→I : Fun(I, S) → S preserves κ-small limits.

Proof. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed. According to Proposition 5.3.1.16, there exists a κ-ﬁltered partially
ordered set A and a coﬁnal map i : N(A) → S. Since i is coﬁnal, the colimit functor for I admits a
factorization

Fun(I, S) i∗

→ Fun(N(A), S)→ S .

Proposition 5.1.2.2 implies that i∗ preserves limits. We may therefore replace I by N(A) and thereby reduce
to the case where I is itself the nerve of a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set A.

We note that the functor lim

−→I : Fun(I, S) → S can be characterized as the left adjoint to the diagonal
functor δ : S → Fun(I, S). Let A denote the category of all functors from A to Set∆; we regard A as a
simplicial model category with respect to the projective model structure described in §A.3.3. Let φ∗ : Set∆ →

323

A denote the diagonal functor which associates to each simplicial set K the constant functor A → Set∆ with
value K, and let φ! be a left adjoint of φ∗, so that the pair (φ∗, φ!) gives a Quillen adjunction between A
and Set∆. Proposition 4.2.4.4 implies that there is an equivalence of ∞-categories N(A◦) → Fun(I, S), and
δ may be identiﬁed with the right derived functor of φ∗. Consequently, the functor lim
−→I may be identiﬁed
with the left derived functor of φ!. To prove that lim
−→I preserves κ-small limits, it suﬃces to prove that lim
−→I
preserves ﬁber products and κ-small products. According to Theorem 4.2.4.1, it suﬃces to prove that φ!
preserves homotopy ﬁber products and κ-small homotopy products. For ﬁber products, this reduces to the
classical assertion that if we are given a family of homotopy Cartesian squares

Wα

Xα

Yα

/ Zα

in the category of Kan complexes, indexed by a ﬁltered partially ordered set A, then the colimit square

W

Y

X

/ Z

is also homotopy Cartesian. The assertion regarding homotopy products is handled similarly.

Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Let K be a κ-small simplicial set and p : K → Iop a diagram; we
wish to prove that Iop
/p is nonempty. Suppose otherwise. Let j : Iop → Fun(I, S) be the Yoneda embedding,
let q = j ◦ p, and let q : K ⊳ → Fun(I, S) be a limit of q, and let X ∈ Fun(I, S) be the image of the cone
point of K ⊳ under q. Since j is fully faithful and Iop
/p is empty, we have MapSI (j(I), X) = ∅ for each I ∈ I.
Using Lemma 5.1.5.2, we may identify MapSI(j(I), X) with X(I) in the homotopy category H of spaces.
We therefore conclude that X is an initial object of Fun(I, S). Since the functor lim
−→I : Fun(I, S) → S is a left
−→I X is an initial object of S. On the other hand, if
adjoint, it preserves initial objects. We conclude that lim
−→I ◦q : K → S. For
lim
−→I preserves κ-small limits, then lim
each vertex k in K, Lemmas 5.1.5.2 and 5.3.3.2 imply that lim
−→I q(k) is contractible, and therefore a ﬁnal
−→I X is also a ﬁnal object of S. This is a contradiction, since the initial object
object of S. It follows that lim
of S is not ﬁnal.

5.3.4 Compact Objects

Let C be a category which admits ﬁltered colimits. An object C ∈ C is said to be compact if the corepre-
sentable functor

HomC(C, •)

commutes with ﬁltered colimits.

Example 5.3.4.1. Let C = Set be the category of sets. An object C ∈ C is compact if and only if is ﬁnite.

Example 5.3.4.2. Let C be the category of groups. An object G of C is compact if and only if it is ﬁnitely
presented (as a group).

Example 5.3.4.3. Let X be a topological space, and let C be the category of open sets of X (with morphisms
given by inclusions). Then an object U ∈ C is compact if and only if U is compact when viewed as a
topological space: that is, every open cover of U admits a ﬁnite subcover.

Remark 5.3.4.4. Because of Example 5.3.4.2, many authors call an object C of a category C ﬁnitely
presented if HomC(C, •) preserves ﬁltered colimits. Our terminology is motivated instead by Example 5.3.4.3.

Deﬁnition 5.3.4.5. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small, κ-ﬁltered colimits. We will say a functor
f : C → D is κ-continuous if it preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits.

Let C be an ∞-category containing an object C, and let jC : C →

S denote the functor corepresented by
C. If C admits κ-ﬁltered colimits, then we will say that C is κ-compact if jC is κ-continuous. We will say
that C is compact if it is ω-compact (and C admits ﬁltered colimits).

The basic properties of κ-compact left ﬁbrations are summarized in the following Lemma::

Lemma 5.3.4.8. Let κ be a regular cardinal.

(1) Let C be an ∞-category which admits small, κ-ﬁltered colimits, and let C ∈ C be an object. Then C is

κ-compact if and only if the left ﬁbration CC/ → C is κ-compact.

inverse limits of towers.

e

A ∪ {∞} → Kan

is stable under κ-small homotopy limits in the diagram category (Set∆)A∪{∞}, which follows easily from our
assumption that A is κ-ﬁltered.

Our next goal is to prove a very useful stability result for κ-compact objects (Proposition 5.3.4.13). We

ﬁrst need to establish a few technical lemmas.

325

Lemma 5.3.4.9. Let κ be a regular cardinal, let C be an ∞-category which admits small, κ-ﬁltered colimits,
and let f : C → D be a morphism in C. Suppose that C and D are κ-compact objects of C. Then f is a
κ-compact object of Fun(∆1, C).

Proof. Let X = Fun(∆1, C) ×Fun({1},C) Cf /, Y = Fun(∆1, CC/), and Z = Fun(∆1, C) ×Fun({1},C) CC/, so that
we have a (homotopy) pullback diagram

Fun(∆1, C)f /

Y

X

/ Z

of left ﬁbrations over Fun(∆1, C). According to Lemma 5.3.4.8, it will suﬃce to show that X, Y , and Z are
κ-compact left ﬁbrations. To show that X is a κ-compact left ﬁbration, it suﬃces to show that Cf / → C is
a κ-compact left ﬁbration, which follows since we have a trivial ﬁbration Cf / → CD/, where D is κ-compact
by assumption. Similarly, we have a trivial ﬁbration Y → Fun(∆1, C) ×C(0) CC/, so that the κ-compactness
of C implies that Y is a κ-compact left ﬁbration. Lemma 5.3.4.8 and the compactness of C immediately
imply that Z is a κ-compact left ﬁbration, which completes the proof.

Lemma 5.3.4.10. Let κ be a regular cardinal, and let {Cα} be a κ-small family of ∞-categories having
product C. Suppose that each C admits small, κ-ﬁltered colimits. Then:

(1) The ∞-category C admits κ-ﬁltered colimits.

(2) If C ∈ C is an object whose image in each Cα is κ-compact, then C is κ-compact as an object of C.

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is obvious, since colimits in a product can be computed pointwise. For the second,
choose an object C ∈ C whose images {Cα ∈ Cα} are κ-compact.

The left ﬁbration CC/ → C can obtained as a κ-small product of the left ﬁbrations C ×Cα (Cα)Cα/ → C.

Lemma 5.3.4.8 implies that each factor is κ-compact, so that the product is also κ-compact.

Lemma 5.3.4.11. Let S be a simplicial set, and suppose given a tower

. . . X(1)

f1→ X(0)

f0→ S

where each fi is a left ﬁbration. Then the inverse limit X(∞) is a homotopy inverse limit of the tower
{X(i)} with respect to the covariant model structure on (Set∆)/S.

Proof. Construct a ladder

the maps f ′
is a covariant equivalence. Since both X(∞) and X ′(∞) are left-ﬁbered over S, this can be tested by passing
to the ﬁbers over each vertex s of S. We may therefore reduce to the case where S is a point, in which case
the tower {X(i)} is already ﬁbrant (since a left ﬁbration over a Kan complex is a Kan ﬁbration; see Lemma
2.1.3.3).

Lemma 5.3.4.12. Let κ be an uncountable regular cardinal, and let

. . . → C2 f2→ C1 f1→ C0
be a tower of ∞-categories. Suppose that each Ci admits small κ-ﬁltered colimits, and that each of the
functors fi is a categorical ﬁbration which preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits. Let C denote the inverse limit of the
tower. Then:

(1) The ∞-category C admits small κ-ﬁltered colimits, and the projections pn : C → Cn are κ-continuous.
(2) If C ∈ C has κ-compact image in Ci for each i ≥ 0, then C is a κ-compact object of C.

Proof. Let q : K ⊲ → C be a diagram indexed by an arbitrary simplicial set, let q = q|K, and set qn = pn ◦ q,
qn = pn ◦ q. Suppose that each qn is a colimit diagram in Cn. Then the map Cq/ → Cq/ is the inverse limit
of a tower of trivial ﬁbrations Cn

qn/, and therefore a a trivial ﬁbration.

qn/ → Cn

To complete the proof of (1), it will suﬃce to show that if K is a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category, then any diagram
q : K → C can be extended to a map q : K ⊲ → C with the property described above. To construct q, it
suﬃces to construct a compatible family qn : K ⊲ → Cn. We begin by selecting arbitrary colimit diagrams
n : K ⊲ → Cn which extend qn. We now explain how to adjust these choices to make them compatible with
q′
one another, using induction on n. Set q0 = q′
0. Suppose next that n > 0. Since fn preserves κ-ﬁltered
colimits, we may identify qn−1 and fn ◦ q′
qn−1/. It follows that there exists an
qn−1/. The map fn induces a categorical ﬁbration Cn
equivalence e : qn−1 → fn ◦ q′
qn−1/, so that
n in Cn
e lifts to an equivalence e : qn → q′
qn/. The existence of the equivalence e proves that qn is a colimit
diagram in Cn, and we have qn−1 = fn ◦ qn by construction. This proves (1).

n with initial objects of Cn−1

qn/ → Cn−1

Now suppose that C ∈ C is as in (2), and let Cn = pn(C) ∈ Cn. The left ﬁbration C/C is the inverse

n in Cn−1

limit of a tower of left ﬁbrations

C 1/ ×C1 C → C0
Using Lemma 5.3.4.8, we deduce that each term in this tower is a κ-compact left ﬁbration over C. Proposition
2.1.2.1 implies that each map in the tower is a left ﬁbration, so that CC/ is a homotopy inverse limit of a
tower of κ-compact left ﬁbrations, by Lemma 5.3.4.11. We now apply Lemma 5.3.4.8 again to deduce that
CC/ is a κ-compact left ﬁbration, so that C ∈ C is κ-compact as desired.

C 0/ ×C0 C .

Proposition 5.3.4.13. Let κ be a regular cardinal, let C be an ∞-category which admits small κ-ﬁltered
colimits, and let f : K → C be a diagram indexed by a κ-small simplicial set K. Suppose that for each vertex
x of K, f (x) ∈ C is κ-compact. Then f is a κ-compact object of Fun(K, C).

Proof. Let us say that a simplicial set K is good if it satisﬁes the conclusions of the lemma. We wish to
prove that all κ-small simplicial sets are good. The proof proceeds in several steps:

(1) Given a pushout square

K ′

i

L′

K

where i is a coﬁbration and the simplicial sets K ′, K, and L′ are good, the simplicial set L is also
good. To prove this, we observe that the associated diagram of ∞-categories

Fun(L, C)

Fun(L′, C)

Fun(K, C)

/ Fun(K ′, C)

is homotopy Cartesian, and every arrow in the diagram preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits (by Proposition
5.1.2.2). Now apply Lemma 5.4.5.7.

the forgetful functor

Fun(K ′, C) → Fun(K, C) is an equivalence of ∞-categories, and therefore detects κ-compact objects.

(3) Every simplex ∆n is good. To prove this, we observe that the inclusion

∆{n−1,n} ⊆ ∆n

(4) If {Kα} is a κ-small collection of good simplicial sets having coproduct K, then K is also good. To

prove this, we observe that Fun(C) ≃

(5) If K is a κ-small simplicial set of dimension ≤ n, then K is good. The proof is by induction on n. Let

(6) Every κ-small simplicial set K is good. If κ = ω, then this follows immediately from (5), since every

κ-small simplicial set is ﬁnite dimensional. If κ is uncountable, then we have an increasing ﬁltration

K (0) ⊆ K (1) ⊆ . . .

which gives rise to a tower of ∞-categories

having (homotopy) inverse limit Fun(K, C). Using Proposition 5.1.2.2, we deduce that the hypotheses
of Lemma 5.3.4.12 are satisﬁed, so that K is good.

Corollary 5.3.4.14. Let κ be a regular cardinal, and let C be an ∞-category which admits small, κ-ﬁltered
colimits. Suppose that p : K → C is a κ-small diagram with the property that for every vertex x of K, p(x)
is a κ-compact object of C. Then the left ﬁbration Cp/ → C is κ-compact.

Proof. It will suﬃce to show that the equivalent left ﬁbration Cp/ → C is κ-compact. Let P be the object of
Fun(K, C) corresponding to p. Then we have an isomorphism of simplicial sets

Cp/ ≃ C ×Fun(K,C) Fun(K, C)P/.

Proposition 5.3.4.13 asserts that P is a κ-compact object of Fun(K, C), so that the left ﬁbration

Fun(K, C)P/ → Fun(K, C)

is κ-compact. Proposition 5.1.2.2 implies that the diagonal map C → Fun(K, C) preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits,
so we can apply part (2) of Lemma 5.3.4.8 to deduce that Cp/ → C is κ-compact, as well.

Corollary 5.3.4.15. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small, κ-ﬁltered colimits, and let Cκ denote the
full subcategory of C spanned by the κ-compact objects. Then Cκ is stable under the formation of all κ-small
colimits which exist in C.

Proof. Let K be a κ-small simplicial set, and let p : K ⊲ → C be a colimit diagram. Suppose that, for each
vertex x of K, the object p(x) ∈ C is κ-compact. We wish to show that C = p(∞) ∈ C is κ-compact, where
∞ denotes the cone point of K ⊲. Let p = p|K, and consider the maps

Cp/ ← Cp/ → CC/ .

Both are trivial ﬁbrations (the ﬁrst because p is a colimit diagram, and the second because the inclusion
{∞} ⊆ K ⊲ is right anodyne). Corollary 5.3.4.14 asserts that the left ﬁbration Cp/ → C is κ-compact. It
follows that the equivalent left ﬁbration CC/ is κ-compact, so that C is a κ-compact object of C as desired.

Remark 5.3.4.16. Let κ be a regular cardinal, and let C be an ∞-category which admits κ-ﬁltered colimits.
Then the full subcategory Cκ ⊆ C of κ-compact objects is stable under retracts. If κ > ω, this follows from
Proposition 4.4.5.15 and Corollary 5.3.4.15 (since every retract can be obtained as a κ-small colimit). We
give an alternative argument that works also in the most important case κ = ω. Let C be κ-compact, and let
D be a retract of C. Let j : Cop → Fun(C,
S) is a retract
of j(C). Since j(C) preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits, then Lemma 5.1.6.3 implies that j(D) preserves κ-ﬁltered
colimits, so that D is κ-compact.

The following result gives a convenient description of the compact objects of an ∞-category of presheaves:

Proposition 5.3.4.17. Let C be a small ∞-category, κ a regular cardinal, and C ∈ P(C) an object. The
following are equivalent:

(1) There exists a diagram p : K → C indexed by a κ-small simplicial set, such that j ◦ p has a colimit D

in P(C), and C is a retract of D.

(2) The object C is κ-compact.

Proof. Proposition 5.1.6.8 asserts that for every object A ∈ C, j(A) is completely compact, and in particular
κ-compact. According to Corollary 5.3.4.15 and Remark 5.3.4.16, the collection of κ-compact objects of P(C)
is stable under κ-small colimits and retracts. Consequently, (1) ⇒ (2).

Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Let C/C = C ×P(C) P(C)/C . Lemma 5.1.5.3 implies that the composition

p : C⊲

/C → P(S)⊲

/C → P(S)

is a colimit diagram. As in the proof of Corollary 4.2.3.11, we can write C as the colimit of a κ-ﬁltered
diagram q : I → P(C), where each object q(I) is the colimit of p| C0, where C0 is a κ-small simplicial subset
of C/C . Since C is κ-compact, we may argue as in the proof of Proposition 5.1.6.8 to deduce that C is a
retract of q(I), for some object I ∈ I. This proves (1).

We close with a result which we will need in §5.5. First, a bit of notation: if C is a small ∞-category and

κ a regular cardinal, we let Pκ(C) denote the full subcategory consisting of κ-compact objects of P(C).

Proposition 5.3.4.18. Let C be a small, idempotent complete ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. The
following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The ∞-category C admits κ-small colimits.

(2) The Yoneda embedding j : C → Pκ(C) has a left adjoint.

329

Proof. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed. For each object M ∈ P(C), let FM : P(C) →
S denote the associated
corepresentable functor. Let D ⊆ P(C) denote the full subcategory of P(C) spanned by those objects M
such that FM ◦ j : C →
S is corepresentable. According to Proposition 5.1.2.2, composition with j induces a
limit-preserving functor

b

b

Fun(P(C),

S) → Fun(C,

S).

Applying Proposition 5.1.3.2 to Cop, we conclude that the collection of corepresentable functors on C is stable
under retracts and κ-small limits. A second application of Proposition 5.1.3.2 (this time to P(C)op) now shows
that D is stable under retracts and κ-small colimits in P(C). Since j is fully faithful, D contains the essential
image of j. It follows from Proposition 5.3.4.17 that D contains Pκ(C). We now apply Proposition 5.2.4.2
to deduce that j : C → Pκ(C) admits a left adjoint.

Conversely, suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Let L denote a left adjoint to the Yoneda embedding, let
p : K → C be a κ-small diagram, and let q = j ◦ p. Using Corollary 5.3.4.15, we deduce that q has a colimit
q : K ⊲ → Pκ(C). Since L is a left adjoint, L ◦ q is a colimit of L ◦ q. Since j is fully faithful, the diagram p
is equivalent to L ◦ q, so that p has a colimit as well.

5.3.5 Ind-Objects

Let S be a simplicial set. In §5.1.5, we proved that the ∞-category P(S) is freely generated under small
colimits by the image of the Yoneda embedding j : S → P(S) (Theorem 5.1.5.6). Our goal in this section is
to study the an analogous construction, where we allow only ﬁltered colimits.

Deﬁnition 5.3.5.1. Let C be a small ∞-category and let κ be a regular cardinal. We let Indκ(C) denote
the full subcategory of P(C) spanned by those functors f : Cop → S which classify right ﬁbrations
C → C
C is κ-ﬁltered. In the case where κ = ω, we will simply write Ind(C) for Indκ(C). We
where the ∞-category
will refer to Ind(C) as the ∞-category of Ind-objects of C.

Remark 5.3.5.2. Let C be a small ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. Then the Yoneda embedding
j : C → P(C) factors through Indκ(C). This follows immediately from Lemma 5.1.5.2, since j(C) classiﬁes
the right ﬁbration C/C → C. The ∞-category C/C has a ﬁnal object and is therefore κ-ﬁltered (Proposition
5.3.1.15).

Proposition 5.3.5.3. Let C be a small ∞-category, and let κ be a regular cardinal. The full subcategory
Indκ(C) ⊆ P(C) is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits.

∆(C)) also belongs to Ind′

∆(C) spanned by right ﬁbrations

Proof. Let P′
C → C. According
∆(C) denote the full subcategory of (Set∆)/ C spanned by the right ﬁbrations
to Proposition 5.1.1.1, the ∞-category P(C) is equivalent to the simplicial nerve N(P′
κ(C)
denote the full subcategory of P′
C is κ-ﬁltered. It will suﬃce
to prove that for any diagram p : I → N(Ind′
∆(C)) indexed by a small κ-ﬁltered ∞-category I, the colimit
of p in N(P′
κ(C). Using Proposition 5.3.1.16, we may reduce to the case where I
is the nerve of a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set A. Using Proposition 4.2.4.4, we may further reduce to the
case where p is the simplicial nerve of a diagram taking values in the ordinary category Ind′
κ(C). In virtue of
Theorem 4.2.4.1, it will suﬃce to prove that Ind′
∆(C) is stable under κ-ﬁltered homotopy colimits.
We may identify P′
∆ with the collection of ﬁbrant objects of (Set∆)/ C with respect to the contravariant
model structure. Since the class of contravariant equivalences is stable under ﬁltered colimits, any κ-ﬁltered
colimit in (Set∆)/ C is also a homotopy colimit. Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that Ind′
∆(C) is
stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits. This follows immediately from the deﬁnition of a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category.

Corollary 5.3.5.4. Let C be a small ∞-category, let κ be a regular cardinal, and let F : Cop → S be an
object of P(C). The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) There exists a (small) κ-ﬁltered ∞-category I, a diagram p : I → C such that F is a colimit of the

composition j ◦ p : I → P(C).

330

(2) The functor F belongs to Indκ(C).

If C admits κ-small colimits, then (1) and (2) are equivalent to

(3) The functor F preserves κ-small limits.

Proof. Lemma 5.1.5.3 implies that F is a colimit of the diagram

C/F → C j

→ P(C),

and Lemma 5.1.5.2 allows us to identify C/F = C ×P(C) P(C)/F with the right ﬁbration associated to F .
Thus (2) ⇒ (1). The converse follows from Proposition 5.3.5.3, since every representable functor belongs to
Indκ(C) (Remark 5.3.5.2).

Now suppose that C admits κ-small colimits. If (3) is satisﬁed, then F op : C → Sop is κ-right exact by
Proposition 5.3.3.3. The right ﬁbration associated to F is the pullback of the universal right ﬁbration by
F op. Using Corollary 3.3.2.7, the universal right ﬁbration over Sop is representable by the ﬁnal object of S.
Since F is κ-right exact, the ﬁber product (Sop)/∗ ×Sop C is κ-ﬁltered. Thus (3) ⇒ (2).

We now complete the proof by showing that (1) ⇒ (3). First suppose that F lies in the essential image
of the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C). According to Lemma 5.1.5.2, j(C) is equivalent to the composition
of the opposite Yoneda embedding j′ : Cop → Fun(C, S) with the evaluation functor e : Fun(C, S) → S
associated to the object C ∈ C. Propositions 5.1.3.2 and 5.1.2.2 imply that j′ and e preserve κ-small limits,
so that j(C) preserves κ-small limits. To conclude the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the collection of
functors F : Cop → S which satisfy (3) is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits: this follows easily from Proposition
5.3.3.3.

Proposition 5.3.5.5. Let C be a small ∞-category, let κ be a regular cardinal, and let j : C → Indκ(C) be
the Yoneda embedding. For each object C ∈ C, j(C) is a κ-compact object of Indκ(C).

Proof. The functor Indκ(C) → S co-represented by j(C) is equivalent to the composition

Indκ(C) ⊆ P(C) → S

where the ﬁrst map is the canonical inclusion and the second is given by evaluation at C. The second map
preserves all colimits (Proposition 5.1.2.2), and the ﬁrst preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits since Indκ(C) is stable
under κ-ﬁltered colimits in P(C) (Proposition 5.3.5.3).

Remark 5.3.5.6. Let C be a small ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. Suppose that C is equivalent to
an n-category, so that the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C) factors through P≤n−1(C) = Fun(Cop, τ≤n−1 S),
where τ≤n−1 S denotes the full subcategory of S spanned by the (n − 1)-truncated spaces: that is, spaces
whose homotopy groups vanish in dimensions n and above. The class of (n − 1)-truncated spaces is stable
under ﬁltered colimits, so that P≤n−1(C) is stable under ﬁltered colimits in P(C). Corollary 5.3.5.4 implies
that Ind(C) ⊆ P≤n−1(C). In particular, Ind(C) is itself equivalent to an n-category. In particular, if C is
the nerve of an ordinary category I, then Ind(C) is equivalent to the nerve of an ordinary category J, which
is uniquely determined up to equivalence. Moreover, J admits ﬁltered colimits, and there is a fully faithful
embedding I → J which generates J under ﬁltered colimits, whose essential image consists of compact objects
of J. It follows that J is equivalent to the category of Ind-objects of I, in the sense of ordinary category
theory.

According to Corollary 5.3.5.4, we may characterize Indκ(C) as the smallest full subcategory of P(C)
which contains the image of the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C) and is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits. Our
goal is to obtain a more precise characterization of Indκ(C): namely, we will show that it is freely generated
by C under κ-ﬁltered colimits.

Lemma 5.3.5.7. Let D be an ∞-category (not necessarily small). There exists a fully faithful functor
i : D → D′ with the following properties:

331

(1) The ∞-category D′ admits small colimits.

(2) A small diagram K ⊲ → D is a colimit if and only if the composite map K ⊲ → D′ is a colimit.

Proof. Let D′ = Fun(D,
Proposition 5.1.2.2 and (2) from Proposition 5.1.3.2.
b

We will need the following analogue of Lemma 5.1.5.5:

S)op, and let i be the opposite of the Yoneda embedding. Then (1) follows from

Lemma 5.3.5.8. Let C be a small ∞-category, κ a regular cardinal, j : C → Indκ(C) the Yoneda embedding,
and C′ ⊆ C the essential image of j. Let D be an ∞-category which admits small κ-ﬁltered colimits. Then:

(1) Every functor f0 : C′ → D admits a left Kan extension f : Indκ(C) → D.

(2) An arbitrary functor f : Indκ(C) → D is a left Kan extension of f | C′ if and only if f is κ-continuous.

Proof. Fix an arbitrary functor f0 : C′ → D. Without loss of generality, we may assume that D is a full
subcategory of a larger ∞-category D′, satisfying the conclusions of Lemma 5.3.5.7; in particular, D is
stable under small κ-ﬁltered colimits in D′. We may further assume that D coincides with its essential
image in D′. Lemma 5.1.5.5 guarantees the existence of a functor F : P(C) → D′ which is a left Kan
extension of f0 = F | C′, and such that F preserves small colimits. Since Indκ(C) is generated by C′ under
κ-ﬁltered colimits (Corollary 5.3.5.4), the restriction f = F | Indκ(C) factors through D. It is then clear that
f : Indκ(C) → D is a left Kan extension of f0, and that f is κ-continuous. This proves (1) and the “only if”
direction of (2) (since left Kan extensions of f0 are unique up to equivalence).

We now prove the “if” direction of (2). Let f : Indκ(C) → D be the functor constructed above, and let
f ′ : Indκ(C) → D be an arbitrary κ-continuous functor such that f | C′ = f ′| C′. We wish to prove that f ′ is
a left Kan extension of f ′| C′. Since f is a left Kan extension of f | C′, there exists a natural transformation
α : f → f ′ which is an equivalence when restricted to C′. Let E ⊆ Indκ(C) be the full subcategory spanned
by those objects C for which the morphism αC : f (C) → f ′(C) is an equivalence in D. By hypothesis,
C′ ⊆ E. Since both f and f ′ are κ-continuous, E is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits in Indκ(C). We now apply
Corollary 5.3.5.4 to conclude that E = Indκ(C). It follows that f ′ and f are equivalent, so that f ′ is a left
Kan extension of f ′| C′ as desired.

Remark 5.3.5.9. The proof of Lemma 5.3.5.8 is very robust, and can be used to establish a number
of analogous results. Roughly speaking, given any class S of colimits, one can consider the smallest full
subcategory C′′ of P(C) which contains the essential image C′ of the Yoneda embedding and is stable under
colimits of type S. Given any functor f0 : C′ → D, where D is an ∞-category which admits colimits of
type S, one can show that there exists a functor f : C′′ → D which is a left Kan extension of f0 = f | C′,
and that f is characterized by the fact that it preserves colimits of type S. Taking S to be the class of all
small colimits, we recover Lemma 5.1.5.5. Taking S to be the class of all small κ-ﬁltered colimits, we recover
Lemma 5.3.5.8. Other variations are possible as well: we will exploit this idea further in §5.3.6.

Proposition 5.3.5.10. Let C and D be ∞-categories, and let κ be a regular cardinal. Suppose that C is
small and that D admits small κ-ﬁltered colimits. Then composition with the Yoneda embedding induces an
equivalence of ∞-categories

Mapκ(Indκ(C), D) → Fun(C, D),

where the left hand side denotes the ∞-category of all κ-continuous functors from Indκ(C) to D.

Proof. Combine Lemma 5.3.5.8 with Corollary 4.3.2.16.

In other words, if C is small and D admits κ-ﬁltered colimits, then any functor f : C → D determines an
essentially unique extension F : Indκ(C) → D (such that f is equivalent to F ◦ j). We next give a criterion
which will allow us to determine when F is an equivalence.

332

Proposition 5.3.5.11. Let C be a small ∞-category, κ a regular cardinal, and D an ∞-category which
admits κ-ﬁltered colimits. Let F : Indκ(C) → D be a κ-continuous functor, and f = F ◦ j its composition
with the Yoneda embedding j : C → Indκ(C). Then:

(1) If f is fully faithful and its essential image consists of κ-compact objects of D, then F is fully faithful.

(2) The functor F is an equivalence if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) The functor f is fully faithful.
(ii) The functor f factors through Dκ.
(iii) The objects {f (C)}C∈C generate D under κ-ﬁltered colimits.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (1), using argument of Proposition 5.1.6.10. Let C and D be objects of Indκ(C). We
wish to prove that the map

ηC,D : MapP(C)(C, D) → MapD(F (C), F (D))

is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H. Suppose ﬁrst that C belongs to the essential image of j.
Let G : P(C) → S be a functor co-represented by C, and let G′ : D → S be a functor co-represented by F (C).
Then we have a natural transformation of functors G → G′ ◦ F . Assumption (2) implies that G′ preserves
small κ-ﬁltered colimits, so that G′ ◦ F preserves small κ-ﬁltered colimits. Proposition 5.3.5.5 implies that G
preserves small κ-ﬁltered colimits. It follows that the collection of objects D ∈ Indκ(C) such that ηC,D is an
equivalence is stable under small κ-ﬁltered colimits colimits. If D belongs to the essential image of j, then
the assumption that f is fully faithful implies that ηC,D is a homotopy equivalence. Since the image of the
Yoneda embedding generates Indκ(C) under small κ-ﬁltered colimits, we conclude that ηC,D is a homotopy
equivalence for every object D ∈ Indκ(C).

We now drop the assumption that C lies in the essential image of j. Fix D ∈ Indκ(C). Let H :
Indκ(C)op → S be a functor represented by D, and let H ′ : Dop → S be a functor represented by F D. Then
we have a natural transformation of functors H → H ′ ◦ F op, which we wish to prove is an equivalence.
By assumption, F op preserves small κ-ﬁltered limits. Proposition 5.1.3.2 implies that H and H ′ preserve
small limits. It follows that the collection P of objects C ∈ P(S) such that ηC,D is an equivalence is stable
under small κ-ﬁltered colimits. The special case above established that P contains the essential image of the
Yoneda embedding. Since Indκ(C) is generated under small κ-ﬁltered colimits by the image of the Yoneda
embedding, we deduce that ηC,D is an equivalence in general. This completes the proof of (1).

We now prove (2). Suppose ﬁrst that F is an equivalence. Then (i) follows from Proposition 5.1.3.1,
(ii) from Proposition 5.3.5.5, and (iii) from Corollary 5.3.5.4. Conversely, suppose that (i), (ii), and (iii)
are satisﬁed. Using (1), we deduce that F is fully faithful. The essential image of F contains the essential
image of f and is stable under small κ-ﬁltered colimits. Therefore F is essentially surjective, so that F is an
equivalence as desired.

According to Corollary 4.2.3.11, an ∞-category C admits small colimits if and only if C admits κ-small

colimits and κ-ﬁltered colimits. Using Proposition 5.3.5.11, we can make a much more precise statement:

Proposition 5.3.5.12. Let C be a small ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. The ∞-category Pκ(C) of
κ-compact objects of P(C) is essentially small: that is, there exists a small ∞-category D and an equivalence
i : D → Pκ(C). Let F : Indκ(D) → P(C) be a κ-continuous functor such that the composition of f with the
Yoneda embedding

D → Indκ(D) → P(C)

is equivalent to i (according to Proposition 5.3.5.10, F exists and is unique up to equivalence). Then F is
an equivalence of ∞-categories.

333

Proof. Since P(C) is locally small, to prove that Pκ(C) is small it will suﬃce to show that the collection of
isomorphism classes of objects in the homotopy category h Pκ(C) is small. For this, we invoke Proposition
5.3.4.17: every κ-compact object X of P(C) is a retract of some object Y , which is itself the colimit of some
composition

K

p
→ C → P(C)

where K is κ-small. Since there is a bounded collection of possibilities for K and p (up to isomorphism in
Set∆), and a bounded collection of idempotent maps Y → Y in h P(C), there are only a bounded number of
possibilities for X.

To prove that F is an equivalence, it will suﬃce to show that F satisﬁes conditions (i), (ii), and (iii)
of Proposition 5.3.5.11. Conditions (i) and (ii) are obvious. For (iii), we must prove that every object of
X ∈ P(C) can be obtained as a small κ-ﬁltered colimit of κ-compact objects of C. Using Lemma 5.1.5.3, we
can write X as a small colimit taking values in the essential image of j : C → P(C). The proof of Corollary
4.2.3.11 shows that X can be written as a κ-ﬁltered colimit of a diagram with values in a full subcategory
E ⊆ P(C), where each object of E is itself a κ-small colimit of some diagram taking values in the essential
image of j. Using Corollary 5.3.4.15, we deduce that E ⊆ Pκ(C), so that X lies in the essential image of F
as desired.

Note that the construction C 7→ Indκ(C) is functorial in C. Given a functor f : C → C′, Proposition
5.3.5.10 implies that the composition of f with the Yoneda embedding jC′ : C′ → Indκ C′ is equivalent to the
composition

C jC→ Indκ C F→ Indκ C′,
where F is a κ-continuous functor. The functor F is well-deﬁned up to equivalence (in fact, up to contractible
ambiguity). We will denote F by Indκ f (though this is perhaps a slight abuse of notation, since F is uniquely
determined only up to equivalence).

Proposition 5.3.5.13. Let f : C → C′ be a functor between small ∞-categories. The following are equiva-
lent:

(1) The functor f is κ-right exact.

(2) The map G : P(C′) → P(C) given by composition with f restricts to a functor g : Indκ(C′) → Indκ(C).

(3) The functor Indκ f has a right adjoint.

Moreover, if these conditions are satisﬁed, then g is a right adjoint to Indκ f .

Proof. The equivalence (1) ⇔ (2) is just a reformulation of the deﬁnition of κ-right exactness. Let P(f ) :
P(C) → P(C′) be a functor which preserves small colimits such that the diagram of ∞-categories

C

f

/ C′

P(C)

P(f )

/ P(C′)

is homotopy commutative. Then we may identify Indκ(f ) with the restriction P(f )| Indκ(C). Proposition
5.2.6.3 asserts that G is a right adjoint of P(f ). Consequently, if (2) is satisﬁed, then g is a right adjoint to
Indκ(f ). We deduce in particular that (2) ⇒ (3). We will complete the proof by showing that (3) implies
(2). Suppose that Indκ(f ) admits a right adjoint g′ : Indκ(C′) → Indκ(C). Let X : (C′)op → S be an object
of Indκ(C′). Then X op is equivalent to the composition

so that G(X)op = f ◦ X op ≃ cg′X ◦ jC, and therefore belongs to Indκ(C).

Proposition 5.3.5.14. Let C be a small ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. The Yoneda embedding
j : C → Indκ(C) preserves all κ-small colimits which exist in C.

Proof. Let K be a κ-small simplicial set, and p : K ⊲ → C a colimit diagram. We wish to show that
j ◦ p : K ⊲ → Indκ(C) is also a colimit diagram. Let C ∈ Indκ(C) be an object, and let F : Indκ(C)op →
S
be the functor represented by F . According to Proposition 5.1.3.2, it will suﬃce to show that F ◦ (j ◦ p)op
is a limit diagram in S. We observe that F ◦ jop is equivalent to the object C ∈ Indκ(C) ⊆ Fun(Cop, S), and
b
therefore κ-right exact. We now conclude by invoking Proposition 5.3.2.9.

We conclude this section with a useful result concerning diagrams in ∞-categories of Ind-objects:

Proposition 5.3.5.15. Let C be a small ∞-category, κ a regular cardinal, and j : C → Indκ(C) the Yoneda
embedding. Let A be a ﬁnite partially ordered set, and let j′ : Fun(N(A), C) → Fun(N(A), Indκ(C)) be the
induced map. Then j′ induces an equivalence

Indκ(Fun(N(A), C)) → Fun(N(A), Indκ(C)).

In other words, every diagram N(A) → Indκ(C) can be obtained, in an essentially unique way, as a

κ-ﬁltered colimit of diagrams N(A) → C.

Warning 5.3.5.16. The statement of Proposition 5.3.5.15 fails if we replace N(A) by an arbitrary ﬁnite
simplicial set. For example, we may identify the category of abelian groups with the category of Ind-objects
of the category of ﬁnitely generated abelian groups. If n > 1, then the map q 7→ q
n from the group of rational
numbers Q to itself cannot be obtained as a ﬁltered colimit of endomorphisms ﬁnitely generated abelian
groups.

Proof of Proposition 5.3.5.15. According to Proposition 5.3.5.11, it will suﬃce to prove the following:

(i) The functor j′ is fully faithful.

(ii) The essential image of j′ consists of κ-compact objects of Fun(N(A), Indκ(C)).

(iii) The essential image of j′ generates Fun(N(A), Indκ(C)) under small, κ-ﬁltered colimits.

Since the Yoneda embedding j : C → Indκ(C) satisﬁes the analogues of these conditions, (i) is obvious and
(ii) follows from Proposition 5.3.4.13. To prove (iii), we ﬁx an object F ∈ Fun(N(A), Indκ(C)). Let C′
denote the essential image of j, and form a pullback diagram of simplicial sets

(a) The ∞-category D is κ-ﬁltered.

(b) The canonical map D⊲ → Fun(N(A), C) is a colimit diagram.

To prove (a), it will to show that D has the right lifting property with respect to the inclusion N(B) ⊆
N(B ∪ {∞}), for every κ-small partially ordered set B (Remark 5.3.1.10). Regard B ∪ {∞, ∞′} as a partially
ordered set with b < ∞ < ∞′ for each b ∈ B. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we see that (a) is equivalent to the
following assertion:

(a′) Let F : N(A × (B ∪ {∞′})) → Indκ(C) be such that F | N(A × {∞′}) = F , and F

′

| N(A × B) factors
: N(A × (B ∪ {∞, ∞′})) → Indκ(C) which extends F , such

through C′. Then there exists a map F
that F

| N(A × (B ∪ {∞})) factors through C′.

To ﬁnd F
of maps

, we write A = {a1, . . . , an}, where ai ≤ aj implies i ≤ j. We will construct a compatible sequence

F k : N((A × (B ∪ {∞′})) ∪ ({a1, . . . , ak} × {∞})) → C
′

. For each a ∈ A, we let A≤a = {a′ ∈ A : a′ ≤ a}, and we deﬁne A<a, A≥a,
with F 0 = F and F n = F
A>a similarly. Supposing that F k−1 has been constructed, we observe that constructing F k amounts to
constructing an object of the ∞-category

(C′

/F | N(A≥ak

))F k−1|M/,

where M = (A≤ak ×B)∪(A<ak ×{∞}). The inclusion {ak} ⊆ N(A≥ak ) is left anodyne. It will therefore suﬃce
to construct an object in the equivalent ∞-category (C′
/F (ak))F k−1|M/. Since M is κ-small, it suﬃces to show
that the ∞-category C′
/F (ak) is κ-ﬁltered. This is simply a reformulation of the fact that F (ak) ∈ Indκ(C).

We now prove (b). It will suﬃce to show that for each a ∈ A, the composition

D⊲ → Fun(N(A), Indκ(C)) → Indκ(C)

is a colimit diagram, where the second map is given by evaluation at a. Let D(a) = C′ ×Indκ(C) Indκ(C)/F (a),
so that D(a) is κ-ﬁltered and the associated map D(a)⊲ → Indκ(C) is a colimit diagram. It will therefore
suﬃce to show that the canonical map D → D(a) is coﬁnal. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it will suﬃce to
show that for each object D ∈ D(a), the ﬁber product E = D ×D(a) D(a)D/ is weakly contractible. In view
of Lemma 5.3.1.18, it will suﬃce to show that E is ﬁltered. This can be established by a minor variation of
the argument given above.

5.3.6 Adjoining Colimits to ∞-Categories

Let C be a small ∞-category. According to Proposition 5.3.5.10, the ∞-category Ind(C) enjoys the following
properties, which characterize it up to equivalence:

(1) There exists a functor j : C → Ind(C).

(2) The ∞-category Ind(C) admits small ﬁltered colimits.

(3) Let D be an ∞-category which admits small ﬁltered colimits, and let Fun′(Ind(C), D) be the full subcat-
egory of Fun(Ind(C), D) spanned by those functors which preserve ﬁltered colimits. Then composition
with j induces an equivalence Fun′(Ind(C), D) → Fun(C, D).

We may informally summarize this characterization as follows: the ∞-category Ind(C) is obtained from C
by freely adjoining the colimits of all small, ﬁltered diagrams. In this section, we will study a generalization
of this construction, which allows us to freely adjoin to C the colimits of any collection of diagrams.

336

Notation 5.3.6.1. Let C and D be ∞-categories, and let R be a collection of diagrams {pα : K ⊲
α → C}.
We let FunR(C, D) denote the full subcategory of Fun(C, D) spanned by those functors which carry each
diagram in R to a colimit diagram in D.

Let K be a collection of simplicial sets. We will say that an ∞-category C admits K-indexed colimits if
it admits K-indexed colimits for each K ∈ K. If f : C → D is a functor between ∞-categories which admit
K-indexed colimits, then we will say that f preserves K-indexed colimits if f preserves K-indexed colimits,
for each K ∈ K. We let FunK(C, D) denote the full subcategory of Fun(C, D) spanned by those functors
which preserves K-indexed colimits.

Proposition 5.3.6.2. Let K be a collection of simplicial sets, C an ∞-category, and R = {pα : K ⊲
collection of diagrams in C. Assume that each Kα belongs to K. Then there exists a new ∞-category PK
and a map j : C → PK

R (C) with the following properties:

α → C} a
R (C)

(1) The ∞-category PK

R (C) admits K-indexed colimits.

(2) For every ∞-category D which admits K-indexed colimits, composition with j induces an equivalence

of ∞-categories

FunK(PK

R (C), D) → FunR(C, D).

Moreover, if every member of R is already a colimit diagram in C, then we have in addition:

(3) The functor j is fully faithful.

Remark 5.3.6.3. In the situation of Proposition 5.3.6.2, assertion (2) (applied in the case D = PK
guarantees that j carries each diagram in R to a colimit diagram in PK
conditions (1) and (2) as follows: the ∞-category PK
subject only to the relations that each diagram in R determines a colimit diagram in PK
this property characterizes PK

R (C))
R (C). We can informally summarize
R (C) is freely generated by C under K-indexed colimits,
R (C). It is clear that

R (C) (and the map j) up to equivalence.

Example 5.3.6.4. Suppose that K is the collection of all small simplicial sets, that the ∞-category C is
small, and that the set of diagrams R is empty. Then the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C) satisﬁes the
conclusions of Proposition 5.3.6.2. This is precisely the assertion of Theorem 5.1.5.6 (save for assertion (3),
which follows from Proposition 5.1.3.1). This justiﬁes the notation of Proposition 5.3.6.2; in the general case
we can think of PK
R (C) as a sort of generalized presheaf category C, and j as an analogue of the Yoneda
embedding.

Proof of Proposition 5.3.6.2: We will employ essentially the same argument as in our proof of Proposition
5.3.5.10. First, we may enlarge the universe if necessary to reduce to the case where every element of K is a
small simplicial set, the ∞-category C is small, and the collection of diagrams R is small. Let j0 : C → P(C)
denote the Yoneda embedding. For every diagram pα : K ⊲ → C, we let pα denote the restriction pα|K,
Xα ∈ P(C) a colimit for the induced diagram j ◦ pα : K → P(C), and Yα ∈ C the image of the cone point
under pα. The diagram j0 ◦ pα induces a map sα : Xα → j0(Yα) (well-deﬁned up to homotopy), let S = {sα}
be the set of all such morphisms. We let S−1 P(C) ⊆ P(C) denote the ∞-category of S-local objects of P(C),
and L : P(C) → S−1 P(C) a left adjoint to the inclusion. We deﬁne PK
R (C) to be the smallest full subcategory
of S−1 P(C) which contains the essential image of the functor L ◦ j0 and is closed under K-indexed colimits,
and let j = L ◦ j0 be the induced map. We claim that the map j : C → PK

R (C) has the desired properties.

Assertion (1) is obvious. We now prove (2). Let D be an ∞-category which admits K-indexed colimits.
In view of Lemma 5.3.5.7, we can assume that there exists a fully faithful inclusion D ⊆ D′, where D′ admits
all small colimits, and D is stable under K-indexed colimits in D′. We have a commutative diagram

We claim that this diagram is a homotopy Cartesian. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, this is equivalent to the
assertion that a functor f ∈ FunK(PK
R (C), D′) factors through D if and only if f ◦ j : C → D′ factors
through D. The “only if” direction is obvious. Conversely, if f ◦ j factors through D, then f −1 D is full
subcategory of PK
R (C) which is stable under K-indexed limits (since f preserves K-indexed limits and D is
stable under K-indexed limits in D) and contains the essential image of j; by minimality, we conclude that
f −1 D = PK

R (C).

Our goal is to prove that the functor φ is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

In view of the preceding
argument, it will suﬃce to show that φ′ is an equivalence of ∞-categories. In other words, we may replace
D by D′ and thereby reduce to the case where D′ admit small colimits.

Let E ⊆ P(C) denote the inverse image L−1 PK

R (C), and let S denote the collection of all morphisms α in
E such that Lα is an equivalence. Composition with L induces a fully faithful embedding Fun(PK
R (C), D) →
Fun(E, D), whose essential image consists of those functors E → D which carry every morphism in S to an
equivalence in D. Furthermore, a functor f : PK
R (C) → D preserves K-indexed colimits if and only if the
composition f ◦ L : E → D preserves K-indexed colimits. The functor φ factors as a composition

FunK(PK

R (C), D) → Fun′(E, D)

ψ
→ FunR(C, D),

where Fun′(E, D) denotes the full subcategory of Fun(E, D) spanned by those functors which carry every
morphism in S to an equivalence and preserve K-indexed colimits. It will therefore suﬃce to show that ψ is
an equivalence of ∞-categories.

In view of Proposition 4.3.2.15, we need only show that if F : E → D is a functor such that F ◦ j0
belongs to FunR(C, D), then F belongs to Fun′(E, D) if and only if F is a left Kan extension of F | C′, where
C′ ⊆ E denotes the essential image of the Yoneda embedding j0 : C → E. We ﬁrst prove the “if” direction.
Let F0 = F | C′. Since D admits small colimits, the functor F0 admits a left Kan extension F : P(C) → D;
without loss of generality we may suppose that F = F | E. According to Lemma 5.1.5.5, the functor F
preserves small colimits. Since E is stable under K-indexed colimits in P(C), it follows that F | E preserves
K-indexed colimits. Furthermore, since F ◦ j0 belongs to FunR(C, D), the functor F carries each morphism
in S to an equivalence in D. It follows that F factors (up to homotopy) through the localization functor L,
so that F | E carries each morphism in S to an equivalence in D.

For the converse, let us suppose that F ∈ Fun′(E, D); we wish to show that F is a left Kan extension
of F | C′. Let F ′ denote an arbitrary left Kan extension of F | C′, so that the identiﬁcation F | C′ = F ′| C′
induces a natural transformation α : F ′ → F . We wish to prove that α is an equivalence. Since F ′ and F
both carry each morphism in S to an equivalence, we may assume without loss of generality that F = f ◦ L,
F ′ = f ′ ◦ L, and α = β ◦ L, where β : f ′ → f is a natural transformation of functors from PK
R (C) to D. Let
X ⊆ PK
R (C) denote the full subcategory spanned by those objects X such that βX : f ′(X) → f (X) is an
equivalence. Since both f ′ and f preserve K-indexed colimits, we conclude that X is stable under K-indexed
colimits in PK
R (C). It follows by
construction that X = PK

R (C). It is clear that X contains the essential image of the functor j : C → PK

R (C), so that β is an equivalence as desired. This completes the proof of (2).

It remains to prove (3). Suppose that every element of R is already a colimit diagram in C. We note
that the functor j factors as a composition L ◦ j0, where the Yoneda embedding j0 : C → E is already known
to be fully faithful (Proposition 5.1.3.1). Since the functor L|S−1 P(C) is equivalent to the identity, it will
suﬃce to show that the essential image of j0 is contained in S−1 P(C). In other words, we must show that
if sα : Xα → j0Yα belongs to S, and C ∈ C, then the induced map

MapP(C)(j0Yα, j0C) → MapP(C)(Xα, j0C)

is a homotopy equivalence. Let p : K ⊲
K ⊲
the diagram

α to Yα), let p = p|Kα, and let q : K ⊲

α → C be the corresponding diagram (so that p carries the cone point of
α → P(C) be a colimit diagram extending q = q|Kα = j0 ◦ p. Consider

P(C)j0Yα/

g0← P(C)j0p/

g1→ P(C)j0p/

g2← P(C)q/

g3→ P(C)Xα/.

The maps g0 and g3 are trivial Kan ﬁbrations (since the inclusion of the cone point into K ⊲
α is coﬁnal), and
the map g2 is a trivial Kan ﬁbration since q is a colimit diagram. Moreover, for every object Z ∈ P(C), the

338

above diagram determines the map MapP(C)(j0Yα, Z) → MapP(C)(Xα, Z). Consequently, to prove that this
map is an equivalence, it suﬃces to show that g1 induces a trivial Kan ﬁbration

P(C)j0p/ ×P(C) {Z} → P(C)j0p/ ×P(C) {Z}.

Assuming Z belongs to the essential image C′ of the Yoneda embedding j0, we may reduce to proving that
the induced map C′
j0p/ is a trivial Kan ﬁbration, which is equivalent to the assertion that j0 ◦ p is a
colimit diagram in C′. This is clear, since p is a colimit diagram by assumption and j0 induces an equivalence
of ∞-categories from C to C′.

j0p/ → C′

Deﬁnition 5.3.6.5. Let K ⊆ K′ be collections of simplicial sets, and let C be an ∞-category which admits
K-indexed limits. We let PK′

Then we have a canonical equivalence PK′
K (C) ≃ Indκ(C). This follows from Theorem 5.5.1.1 and Proposition
5.5.1.9.

to D and there is nothing to prove. If n > 0, then set D′ = FunRn (Cn, D) and D′′ = FunK(PK
R1 (Cn), D).
Proposition 5.3.6.2 implies that the canonical map D′′ → D′ is an equivalence of ∞-categories. We can

5.4 Accessible ∞-Categories

Many of the categories which commonly arise in mathematics can be realized as categories of Ind-objects.
For example, the category of sets is equivalent to Ind(C), where C is the category of ﬁnite sets; the category
of rings is equivalent to Ind(C), where C is the category of ﬁnitely presented rings. The theory of accessible
categories is an axiomatization of this situation. We refer the reader to [1] for an exposition of the theory
of accessible categories. In this section, we will describe an ∞-categorical generalization of the theory of
accessible categories.

We will begin in §5.4.1 by introducing the notion of a locally small ∞-category. A locally small ∞-
category C need not be small, but has small morphism spaces MapC(X, Y ) for any ﬁxed pair of objects
X, Y ∈ C. This is analogous to the usual set-theoretic conventions taken in category theory: one allows
categories which have a proper class of objects, but requires that morphisms between any pair of objects
form a set.

In §5.4.2, we will introduce the deﬁnition of an accessible ∞-category. An ∞-category C is accessible if it
is locally small and has a good supply of ﬁltered colimits and compact objects. Equivalently, C is accessible if
it is equivalent to Indκ(C0), for some small ∞-category C0 and some regular cardinal κ (Proposition 5.4.2.2).
The theory of accessible ∞-categories will play an important technical role throughout the remainder
of this book. To understand the usefulness of the hypothesis of accessibility, let us consider the following
example. Suppose that C is an ordinary category, F : C → Set is a functor, and we would like to prove that
F is representable by an object C ∈ C. The functor F determines a category
C = {(C, η) : C ∈ C, η ∈ F (C)},
C is equivalent to C/C , for some C ∈ C. The
which is ﬁbered over C in sets. We would like to prove that
C → C. If C admits colimits, then we

We refer the reader to §5.5.2 for a detailed account of this argument, which we will use to prove an ∞-
categorical version of the adjoint functor theorem.

e

The discussion above can be summarized as follows: the theory of accessible ∞-categories is a tool
which allows us to manipulate large ∞-categories as if they were small, without fear of encountering any
set-theoretic paradoxes. This theory is quite useful because the condition of accessibility is very robust: the
class of accessible ∞-categories is stable under most of the basic constructions of higher category theory. To
illustrate this, we will prove the following results:

(1) A small ∞-category C is accessible if and only if C is idempotent complete (§5.4.3).

(2) If C is an accessible ∞-category and K is a small simplicial set, then Fun(K, C) is accessible (§5.4.4).

(3) If C is an accessible ∞-category and p : K → C is a small diagram, then Cp/ and C/p are accessible

(§5.4.5 and §5.4.6).

(4) The collection of accessible ∞-categories is stable under homotopy ﬁber products (§5.4.6).

We will apply these facts in §5.4.7 to deduce a miscellany of further stability results, which will be needed

throughout §5.5 and §6.

5.4.1 Locally Small ∞-Categories

In mathematical practice, it is very common to encounter categories C for which the collection of all objects
is large (too big to be form a set), but the collection of morphisms HomC(X, Y ) is small for every X, Y ∈ C.
The same situation arises frequently in higher category theory. However, it is a slightly trickier to describe,
because the formalism of ∞-categories blurs the distinction between objects and morphisms. Nevertheless,
there is an adequate notion of “local smallness” in the ∞-categorical setting, which we will describe in this
section.

Our ﬁrst step is to give a characterization of the class of essentially small ∞-categories. We will need the

following lemma.

Lemma 5.4.1.1. Let C be a simplicial category, n a positive integer, and f0 : ∂ ∆n → N(C) a map. Let
X = f0({0}), Y = f0({n}), and g0 denote the induced map

∂(∆1)n−1 → MapC(X, Y ).

Let f, f ′ : ∆n → N(C) be extensions of f0, and g, g′ : (∆1)n−1 → MapC(X, Y ) the corresponding extensions
of g0. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The maps f and f ′ are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n.

(2) The maps g and g′ are homotopic relative to ∂(∆1)n−1.

Proof. It is not diﬃcult to show that (1) is equivalent to the assertion that f and f ′ are left homotopic in
the model category (Set∆)∂ ∆n/ (with the Joyal model structure), and that (2) equivalent to the assertion
that C[f ] and C[f ′] are left homotopic in the model category (Cat∆)C[∂ ∆n]/. We now invoke the Quillen
equivalence of Theorem 2.2.5.1 to complete the proof.

Proposition 5.4.1.2. Let C be an ∞-category, and κ an uncountable regular cardinal. The following con-
ditions are equivalent:

(1) The collection of equivalence classes of objects of C is κ-small, and for every morphism f : C → D in

C and every n ≥ 0, the homotopy set πi(HomR

C (C, D), f ) is κ-small.

(2) If C′ ⊆ C is a minimal model for C, then C′ is κ-small.

(3) There exists a κ-small ∞-category C′ and an equivalence C′ → C of ∞-categories.

(4) There exists a κ-small simplicial set K and a categorical equivalences K → C.

(5) The ∞-category C is κ-compact, when regarded as an object of Cat∞.

Proof. We begin by proving that (1) ⇒ (2). Without loss of generality, we may suppose that C = N(D),
where D is a topological category. Let C′ ⊆ C be a minimal model for C. We will prove by induction on
n ≥ 0 that the set HomSet∆ (∆n, C′) is κ-small. If n = 0, this reduces to the assertion that C has fewer
than κ equivalence classes of objects. Suppose therefore that n > 0. By the inductive hypothesis, the set
HomSet∆(∂ ∆n, C′) is κ-small. Since κ is regular, it will suﬃce to prove that for each map f0 : ∂ ∆n → C′,
the set S = {f ∈ HomSet∆(∆n, C′) : f | ∂ ∆n = f0} is κ-small. Let C = f0({0}), D = f0({n}), and let
g0 : ∂(∆1)n−1 → MapD(C, D) be the corresponding map. Assumption (1) ensures that there are fewer than
κ extensions g : (∆1)n−1 → MapD(C, D) modulo homotopy relative to ∂(∆1)n−1. Invoking Lemma 5.4.1.1,
we deduce that there are fewer than κ maps f : ∆n → C modulo homotopy relative to ∂ ∆n. Since C′ is
minimal, no two distinct elements of S are homotopic in C relative to ∂ ∆n; therefore S is κ-small as desired.
It is clear that (2) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (4). We next show that (4) ⇒ (3). Let K → C be a categorical equivalence,

where K is κ-small. We construct a sequence of inner anodyne inclusions

K = K(0) ⊆ K(1) ⊆ . . .

342

Supposing that K(n) has been deﬁned, we form a pushout diagram

where the coproduct is taken over all 0 < i < n and all maps Λn
i → K(n). It follows by induction on n
n K(n) is κ-small.The
that each K(n) is κ-small. Since κ is regular and uncountable, the limit K(∞) =
inclusion K ⊆ K(∞) is inner anodyne; therefore the map K → C factors through an equivalence K(∞) → C
of ∞-categories; thus (3) is satisﬁed.

S

We next show that (3) ⇒ (5). Suppose that (3) is satisﬁed. Without loss of generality, we may replace C
by C′ and thereby suppose that C is itself κ-small. Let F : Cat∞ → S denote the functor co-represented by
C. According to Lemma 5.1.5.2, we may identify F with the simplicial nerve of the functor f : Cat∆
∞ → Kan,
which carries an ∞-category D to the largest Kan complex contained in DC. Let I be a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category
and p : I → Cat∞ a diagram. We wish to prove that p has a colimit p : I⊲ → Cat∞ such that F ◦ p is a colimit
diagram in S. According to Proposition 5.3.1.16, we may suppose that I is the nerve of a κ-ﬁltered partially
ordered set A. Using Proposition 4.2.4.4, we may further reduce to the case where p is the simplicial nerve
of a diagram P : A → Cat∆
∆ taking values in the ordinary category of marked simplicial sets. Let
P be a colimit of P . Since the class of weak equivalences in Set+
∆ is stable under ﬁltered colimits, P is a
homotopy colimit. Theorem 4.2.4.1 implies that p = N(P ) is a colimit of p. It therefore suﬃces to show that
F ◦ p = N(f ◦ P ) is a colimit diagram. Using Theorem 4.2.4.1, it suﬃces to show that f ◦ P is a homotopy
colimit diagram in Set∆. Since the class of weak homotopy equivalences in Set∆ is stable under ﬁltered
colimits, it will suﬃce to prove that f ◦ P is a colimit diagram in the ordinary category Set∆. It now suﬃces
to observe that f preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits, because C is κ-small.

∞ ⊆ Set+

We now complete the proof by showing that (5) ⇒ (1). Let A denote the collection of all κ-small
simplicial subsets Kα ⊆ C, and let A′ ⊆ A be the subcollection consisting of indices α such that Kα is an
∞-category. It is clear that A is a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set, and that C =
α∈A Kα. Using the fact
that κ > ω, it is easy to see that A′ is coﬁnal in A, so that A′ is also κ-ﬁltered and C =
α∈A′ Kα. We may
S
therefore regard C as the colimit of a diagram P : A′ → Set+
∆ in the ordinary category of ﬁbrant objects of
Set+
∆. Since A′ is ﬁltered, we may also regard C as a homotopy colimit of P . The above argument shows
that CC = f C can be identiﬁed with a homotopy colimit of the diagram f ◦ P : A′ → Set∆. In particular,
the vertex idC ∈ CC must be homotopic to the image of some map K C
α → CC, for some α ∈ A′. It follows
that C is a retract of Kα in the homotopy category hCat∞. Since Kα is κ-small, we easily deduce that Kα
satisﬁes condition (1). Therefore C, being a retract of Kα, satisﬁes condition (1) as well.

S

Deﬁnition 5.4.1.3. An ∞-category C is essentially κ-small if it satisﬁes the equivalent conditions of Propo-
sition 5.4.1.2. We will say that C is essentially small if it is essentially κ-small for some (small) regular
cardinal κ.

The following criterion for essential smallness is occasionally useful:

Proposition 5.4.1.4. Let p : C → D be a Cartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories and κ an uncountable regular
cardinal. Suppose that D is essentially κ-small and that, for each object D ∈ D, the ﬁber CD = C ×D{D} is
essentially κ-small. Then C is essentially κ-small.

Proof. We will apply criterion (1) of Proposition 5.4.1.2. Choose a κ-small set of representatives {Dα} for
the equivalence classes of objects of D. For each α, choose a κ-small set of representatives {Cα,β} for the
equivalence classes of objects of CDα . The collection of all objects Cα,β is κ-small (since κ is regular) and
contains representatives for all equivalence classes of objects of C.

Now suppose that C and C′ are objects of C, having images D, D′ ∈ D. Since D is essentially κ-small,
the set π0 MapD(D, D′) is κ-small. Let f : D → D′ be a morphism, and choose a p-Cartesian morphism

By restricting our attention to Kan complexes, we obtain an analogue of Proposition 5.4.1.2 for spaces:

Corollary 5.4.1.5. Let X be a Kan complex, and κ an uncountable regular cardinal. The following condi-
tions are equivalent:

(1) For each vertex x ∈ X and each n ≥ 0, the homotopy set πn(X, x) is κ-small.

(2) If X ′ ⊆ X is a minimal model for X, then X ′ is κ-small.

(3) There exists a κ-small Kan complex X ′ and a homotopy equivalence X ′ → X.

(4) There exists a κ-small simplicial set K and a weak homotopy equivalence K → X.

(5) The ∞-category C is κ-compact, when regarded as an object of S.

(6) The Kan complex X is essentially small (when regarded as an ∞-category).

Proof. The equivalences (1) ⇔ (2) ⇔ (3) ⇔ (6) follow from Proposition 5.4.1.2. The implication (3) ⇒ (4)
is obvious. We next prove that (4) ⇒ (5). Let p : K → S be the constant diagram taking the value ∗, let
p : K ⊲ → S be a colimit of p, and let X ′ ∈ S be the image under p of the cone point of K ⊲. It follows
from Proposition 5.1.6.8 that ∗ is a κ-compact object of S. Corollary 5.3.4.15 implies that X ′ is a κ-compact
object of S. Let
K denote the ﬁber lying over
the cone point of K ⊲. The inclusion of the cone point in K ⊲ is right anodyne. It follows from Proposition
4.1.2.14 that the inclusion X ′′ ⊆
K is right anodyne. Since p is a colimit diagram, Proposition 3.3.4.5 implies
e
that the inclusion K ≃ K ×K ⊲
K is a weak homotopy equivalence. We therefore have a chain of weak
homotopy equivalences

K → K ⊲ denote the left ﬁbration associated to p, and let X ′′ ⊆

X ← K ⊆

K ← X ′′ ← X ′,

so that X and X ′ are equivalent objects of S. Since X ′ is κ-compact, it follows that X is κ-compact.

To complete the proof, we will show that (5) ⇒ (1). We employ the argument used in the proof of
Proposition 5.4.1.2. Let F : S → S be the functor co-represented by X. Using Lemma 5.1.5.2, we can
identify F can be with the simplicial nerve of the functor f : Kan → Kan given by

e

Y 7→ Y X .

Let A denote the collection of κ-small simplicial subsets Xα ⊆ X which are Kan complexes. Since κ is
α∈A Kα. We may regard X as the colimit of a diagram P : A → Set∆.
uncountable, A is κ-ﬁltered and X =
Since A is ﬁltered, X is also a homotopy colimit of this diagram. Since F preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits, f
preserves κ-ﬁltered homotopy colimits; therefore X X is a homotopy colimit of the diagram f ◦P . In particular,
the vertex idX ∈ X X must be homotopic to the image of some map X X
α → X X, for some α ∈ A. It follows
that X is a retract of Xα in the homotopy category H. Since Xα is κ-small, we can readily verify that Xα
satisﬁes (1). Because X is a retract of Xα, X satisﬁes (1) as well.

S

Remark 5.4.1.6. When κ = ω, the situation is quite a bit more complicated. Suppose that X is a Kan
complex representing a compact object of S. Then there exists a simplicial set Y with only ﬁnitely many
nondegenerate simplices, and a map i : Y → X which realizes X as a retract of Y in the homotopy category
H of spaces. However, one cannot generally assume that Y is a Kan complex, or that i is a weak homotopy
equivalence. The latter can be achieved if X is connected and simply connected, or more generally if a
certain K-theoretic invariant of X (the Wall ﬁniteness obstruction ) vanishes: we refer the reader to [81] for
a discussion.

For many applications, it is important to be able to slightly relax the condition that an ∞-category be

essentiall small.

Proposition 5.4.1.7. Let C be an ∞-category. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the space MapC(X, Y ) is essentially small.

(2) For every small collection S of objects of C, the full subcategory of C spanned by the elements of S is

essentially small.

Proof. This follows immediately from criterion (1) in Propositions 5.4.1.2 and 5.4.1.5.

We will say that an ∞-category C is locally small if it satisﬁes the equivalent conditions of Proposition

5.4.1.7.

Example 5.4.1.8. Let C and D be ∞-categories. Suppose that C is locally small and that D is essentially
small. Then CD is essentially small. To prove this, we may assume without loss of generality that C and D
are minimal. Let {Cα} denote the collection of all full subcategories of C, spanned by small collections of
objects. Since D is small, every ﬁnite collection of functors D → C factors through some small Cα ⊆ C. It
follows that Fun(D, C) is the union of it small full subcategories Fun(D, Cα), and is therefore locally small.
In particular, for every small ∞-category D, the ∞-category P(D) of presheaves is locally small.

5.4.2 Accessibility

In this section, we will begin our study of the class of accessible ∞-categories.

Deﬁnition 5.4.2.1. Let κ be a regular cardinal. An ∞-category C is κ-accessible if there exists a small
∞-category C0 and an equivalence Indκ(C0) → C. We will say that C is accessible if it is κ-accessible for
some regular cardinal κ.

The following result gives a few alternative characterizations of the class of accessible ∞-categories.

Proposition 5.4.2.2. Let C be an ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The ∞-category C is κ-accessible.

(2) The ∞-category C is locally small, admits κ-ﬁltered colimits, the full subcategory Cκ ⊆ C of κ-compact

objects is essentially small, and Cκ generates C under small, κ-ﬁltered colimits.

(3) The ∞-category C admits small κ-ﬁltered colimits and contains an essentially small full subcategory

C′′ ⊆ C which consists of κ-compact objects and generates C under small κ-ﬁltered colimits.

The main obstacle to proving Proposition 5.4.2.2 is in verifying that if C0 is small, then Indκ(C0) has only
a bounded number of κ-compact objects, up to equivalence. It is tempting to guess that any such object
must be equivalent to an object of C0. The following example shows that this is not necessarily the case.

Example 5.4.2.3. Let R be a ring, and let C0 denote the (ordinary) category of ﬁnitely generated free
R-modules. Then C = Ind(C0) is equivalent to the category of ﬂat R-modules (by Lazard’s theorem; see
for example the appendix of [47]). The compact objects of C are precisely the ﬁnitely generated projective
R-modules, which need not be free.

Nevertheless, the naive guess is not far oﬀ, in virtue of the following result:

Lemma 5.4.2.4. Let C be a small ∞-category, κ a regular cardinal, and C′ ⊆ Indκ(C) the full subcategory
of Indκ(C) spanned by the κ-compact objects. Then the Yoneda embedding j : C → C′ exhibits C′ as an
idempotent completion of C. In particular, C′ is essentially small.

345

Proof. Corollary 4.4.5.16 implies that Indκ(C) is idempotent complete. Since C′ is stable under retracts in
Indκ(C), C′ is also idempotent complete. Proposition 5.1.3.1 implies that j is fully faithful.
It therefore
suﬃces to prove that every object C′ ∈ C′ is a retract of j(C), for some C ∈ C.
Let C/C ′ = C ×Indκ(C) Indκ(C)/C ′ . Lemma 5.1.5.3 implies that the diagram

p : C⊲

/C ′ → Indκ(C)⊲

/C ′ → Indκ(C)

is a colimit of p = p| C/C ′. Let F : Indκ(C) → S be the functor co-represented by C′; we note that the left
ﬁbration associated to F is equivalent to Indκ(C)C ′/. Since F is κ-continuous, Proposition 3.3.4.5 implies
that the inclusion

C/C ′ ×Indκ(C) Indκ(C)C ′/ ⊆ C⊲

/C ′ ×Indκ(C) Indκ(C)C ′/

is a weak homotopy equivalence. The simplicial set on the right has a canonical vertex, corresponding to
the identity map idC ′. It follows that there exists a vertex on the left hand side belonging to the same path
component. Such a vertex classiﬁes a diagram

C′

where f is homotopic to the identity, which proves that C′ is a retract of j(C) in Indκ(C).

Proof of Proposition 5.4.2.2. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed. Without loss of generality we may suppose that
C = Indκ C′, where C′ is small. Since C is a full subcategory of P(C′), it is locally small (see Example
5.4.1.8). Proposition 5.3.5.3 implies that C admits small κ-ﬁltered colimits. Corollary 5.3.5.4 shows that C
is generated under κ-ﬁltered colimits by the essential image of the Yoneda embedding j : C′ → C, which
consists of κ-compact objects by Proposition 5.3.5.5. Lemma 5.4.2.4 implies that full subcategory of Indκ(C′)
consisting of compact objects is essentially small. We conclude that (1) ⇒ (2).

It is clear that (2) ⇒ (3). Suppose that (3) is satisﬁed. Choose a small ∞-category C′ and an equivalence

i : C′ → C′′. Using Proposition 5.3.5.10, we may suppose that i factors as a composition

→ Indκ(C′)

equivalence. This shows that (3) ⇒ (1) and completes the proof.

It follows from Proposition 5.3.5.11 that f is a categorical

Deﬁnition 5.4.2.5. If C is an accessible ∞-category, then a functor F : C → C′ is accessible if it is
κ-continuous for some regular cardinal κ (and therefore for all regular cardinals τ ≥ κ).

Remark 5.4.2.6. Generally we will only speak of the accessibility of a functor F : C → C′ in the case where
both C and C′ are accessible. However, it is occasionally convenient to use the terminology of Deﬁnition
5.4.2.5 in the case where C is accessible and C′ is not (or C′ is not yet known to be accessible).

Example 5.4.2.7. The ∞-category S of spaces is accessible. More generally, for any small ∞-category C,
the ∞-category P(C) is accessible: this follows immediately from Proposition 5.3.5.12.

If C is a κ-accessible ∞-category and τ > κ, then C is not necessarily τ -accessible. Nevertheless, this is

true for many values of τ .

Deﬁnition 5.4.2.8. Let κ and τ be regular cardinals. We write τ ≪ κ if the following condition is satisﬁed:
for every τ0 < τ and every κ0 < κ, we have κτ0

0 < κ.

Note that there exist arbitrarily large regular cardinals κ′ with κ′ ≫ κ: for example, one may take κ′ to

be the successor of any cardinal having the form τ κ.

Remark 5.4.2.9. Every (inﬁnite) regular cardinal κ satisﬁes ω ≪ κ. An uncountable regular cardinal κ
satisﬁes κ ≪ κ if and only if κ is strongly inaccessible.

Lemma 5.4.2.10. If κ′ ≫ κ, then any κ′-ﬁltered partially ordered set I may be written as a union of
κ-ﬁltered subsets having size < κ′. Moreover, the family of all such subsets is κ′-ﬁltered.

Proof. It will suﬃce to show that every subset of S ⊆ I having cardinality < κ′ can be included in a larger
subset S′, such that |S′| < κ′, but S′ is κ-ﬁltered.

We deﬁne a transﬁnite sequence of subsets Sα ⊆ I by induction. Let S0 = S, and when λ is a limit
α<λ Sα. Finally, we let Sα+1 denote a set which is obtained from Sα by adjoining an
ordinal we let Sλ =
upper bound for every subset of Sα having size < κ (which exists because I is κ′-ﬁltered). It follows from
the assumption κ′ ≫ κ that if Sα has size < κ′, then so does Sα+1. Since κ′ is regular, we deduce easily by
induction that |Sα| < κ′ for all α < κ′. It is easy to check that the set S′ = Sκ has the desired properties.

S

Proposition 5.4.2.11. Let C be a κ-accessible ∞-category. Then C is κ′-accessible for any κ′ ≫ κ.

Proof. Let Cκ ⊆ C denote the full subcategory consisting of κ-compact objects, and let C′ ⊆ C denote the full
subcategory spanned by the colimits of all κ′-small, κ-ﬁltered diagrams in Cκ. Since C is locally small and
the collection of all equivalence classes of such diagrams is bounded, we conclude that C′ is essentially small.
Corollary 5.3.4.15 implies that C′ consists of κ′-compact objects of C. According to Proposition 5.4.2.2, it
will suﬃce to prove that C′ generates C under small κ′-ﬁltered colimits. Let X be an object of C, and let
p : I → Cκ be a small κ-ﬁltered diagram with colimit X. Using Proposition 5.3.1.16, we may reduce to
the case where I is the nerve of a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set A. Lemma 5.4.2.10 implies that A can be
written as a κ′-ﬁltered union of κ′-small, κ-ﬁltered subsets {Aβ ⊆ A}β∈B. Using Propositions 4.2.3.4 and
4.2.3.8, we deduce that X can also be obtained as the colimit of a diagram indexed by N(B), which takes
values in C′.

Remark 5.4.2.12. If C is a κ-accessible ∞-category and κ′ > κ, then C is generally not κ′-accessible. There
are counterexamples even in ordinary category theory: see [1].

Remark 5.4.2.13. Let C be an accessible ∞-category and κ a regular cardinal. Then the full subcategory
Cκ ⊆ C consisting of κ-compact objects is essentially small. To prove this, we are free to enlarge κ and we
may invoke Proposition 5.4.2.11 to reduce to the case where C is κ-accessible, in which case the desired result
is a consequence of Proposition 5.4.2.2.

Notation 5.4.2.14. If C and D are accessible ∞-categories, we will write FunA(C, D) to denote the full
subcategory of Fun(C, D) spanned by accessible functors from C to D.

Remark 5.4.2.15. Accessible ∞-categories are usually not small. However, they are determined by a
“small” amount of data: namely, they always have the form Indκ(C) where C is a small ∞-category. Similarly,
an accessible functor F : C → D between accessible categories is determined by a “small” amount of data,
in the sense that there always exists a regular cardinal κ such that F is κ-continuous and maps Cκ into Dκ.
The restriction F | Cκ then determines F up to equivalence, by Proposition 5.3.5.10. To prove the existence
of κ, we ﬁrst choose a regular cardinal τ such that F is τ -continuous. Enlarging τ if necessary, we may
suppose that C and D are τ -accessible. The collection of equivalence classes of τ -compact objects of C is
small; consequently, Remark 5.4.2.13 there exists a (small) regular cardinal τ ′ such that F carries Cτ into
Dτ ′

. We may now choose κ to be any regular cardinal such that κ ≫ τ ′.

Deﬁnition 5.4.2.16. Let κ be a regular cardinal. We let Accκ ⊆
follows:

Cat∞ denote the subcategory deﬁned as

(1) The objects of Accκ are the κ-accessible ∞-categories.

d

(2) A functor F : C → D between accessible ∞-categories belongs to Acc if and only if F is κ-continuous

and preserves κ-compact objects.

Let Acc =

κ Accκ. We will refer to Acc as the ∞-category of accessible ∞-categories.

Cat∞ be the simplicial nerve of the
Proposition 5.4.2.17. Let κ be a regular cardinal, and let θ : Accκ →
functor which associates to each C ∈ Accκ the full subcategory of C spanned by the κ-compact objects. Then:

S

(1) The functor θ is fully faithful.

d

(2) An ∞-category C ∈

Cat∞ belongs to the essential image of θ if and only if C is essentially small and

idempotent complete.

d

Proof. Assertion (1) follows immediately from Proposition 5.3.5.10. If C ∈
Cat∞ belongs to the essential
image of θ, then C is essentially small and idempotent complete (because C is stable under retracts in an
idempotent complete ∞-category). Conversely, suppose that C is essentially small and idempotent complete,
and choose a minimal model C′ ⊆ C. Then Indκ(C′) is κ-accessible. Moreover, the collection of κ-compact
objects of Indκ(C′) is an idempotent completion of C′ (Lemma 5.4.2.4), and therefore equivalent to C (since
C′ is already idempotent complete).

d

Let Cat∨

∞ denote the full subcategory of Cat∞ spanned by the idempotent complete ∞-categories.

Proposition 5.4.2.18. The inclusion Cat∨

∞ ⊆ Cat∞ has a left adjoint.

Proof. Combine Propositions 5.1.4.2, 5.1.4.9, and 5.2.7.8.

We will refer to a left adjoint to the inclusion Cat∨

∞ ⊆ Cat∞ as the idempotent completion functor.
Cat∞ ←֓ Cat∨
∞ with the same
Proposition 5.4.2.17 implies that we have fully faithful embeddings Accκ →
essential image. Consequently, there is a (canonical) equivalence of ∞-categories e : Cat∨
∞ ≃ Accκ, well-
deﬁned up to homotopy. We let Indκ : Cat∞ → Accκ denote the composition of e with the idempotent
completion functor. In summary:

d

Proposition 5.4.2.19. There is a functor Indκ : Cat∞ → Accκ which exhibits Accκ as a localization of the
∞-category Cat∞.

Remark 5.4.2.20. There is a slight danger of confusion with our terminology. The functor Indκ : Cat∞ →
Accκ is only well-deﬁned up to contractible space of choices, so that if C is an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite
colimits, then the image of C under Indκ is only well-deﬁned up to equivalence. Deﬁnition 5.3.5.1 produces
a canonical representative for this image.

5.4.3 Accessibility and Idempotent Completeness

Let C be an accessible ∞-category. Then there exists a regular cardinal κ such that C admits κ-ﬁltered
colimits. It follows from Corollary 4.4.5.16 that C is idempotent complete. Our goal in this section is to
prove a converse to this result: if C is a small and idempotent complete, then C is accessible.

Let C be a small ∞-category, and suppose we want to prove that C is accessible. The main problem is
to show that C admits κ-ﬁltered colimits, provided that κ is suﬃciently large. The idea is that if κ is much
larger than the size of C, then any κ-ﬁltered diagram J → C is necessarily very “redundant” (Proposition
5.4.3.4). Before we making this precise, we will need a few preliminary results.

Lemma 5.4.3.1. Let κ < τ be uncountable regular cardinals, A a τ -ﬁltered partially ordered set, and
F : A → Kan a diagram of Kan complexes indexed by A. Suppose that for each α ∈ A, the Kan complex
F (α) is essentially κ-small. For every τ -small subset A0 ⊆ A, there exists a ﬁltered τ -small subset A′
0 ⊆ A
containing A0, with the property that the map

is a homotopy equivalence.

Proof. Let X = lim
F (α). Since F is a ﬁltered diagram, X is also a Kan complex. Let K be a simplicial
set with only ﬁnitely many nondegenerate simplices. Our ﬁrst claim is that the set [K, X] of homotopy
classes of maps from K into X has cardinality < κ. For suppose given a collection {gβ : K → X} of pairwise
nonhomotopic maps, having cardinality κ. Since A is τ -ﬁltered, we may suppose that there is a ﬁxed index

Lemma 5.4.3.3. Let κ < τ be uncountable regular cardinals. Let C be a τ -small ∞-category with the
property that each of the spaces MapC(C, D) is essentially κ-small, and j : C → P(C) the Yoneda embedding.
Let p : K → C be a diagram indexed by a τ -ﬁltered ∞-category K, and p : K⊲ → P(C) a colimit of j ◦ p.
Then there exists a map i : K → K such that K is τ -small, and the composition p ◦ i⊲ : K ⊲ → K⊲ → P(C)
is a colimit diagram.

Proof. In view of Proposition 5.3.1.16, we may suppose that K is the nerve of a τ -ﬁltered partially ordered

where eC denote the evaluation functor associated to an object C ∈ C. We will identify K⊲ with the
nerve of the partially ordered set A ∪ {∞}. Proposition 4.2.4.4 implies that we may replace pC with the
simplicial nerve of a functor FC : A ∪ {∞} → Kan. Our hypothesis on C implies that FC |A takes values in

again, we deduce that the composition eC ◦ p ◦ i⊲ : K ⊲ → S is a colimit diagram for each C ∈ C. Applying
Proposition 5.1.2.2, we deduce that p ◦ i⊲ is a colimit diagram, as desired.

Proposition 5.4.3.4. Let κ < τ be uncountable regular cardinals. Let C be an ∞-category which is τ -small,
such that the morphism spaces MapC(C, D) are essentially κ-small. Let j : C → P(C) denote the Yoneda

Proof. Let i : K → K be a map satisfying the conclusions of Lemma 5.4.3.3. Since K is τ -small and K is

Now suppose that C is small and accessible, and let D be a κ-accessible ∞-category and f : C → D any
functor; we wish to prove that f is accessible. By Proposition 5.3.5.10, we may suppose that f = F ◦ j, where
j : C → Indκ(C) is the Yoneda embedding and F : Indκ(C) → D is a κ-continuous functor, and therefore
accessible. Enlarging κ if necessary, we may suppose that j is an equivalence of ∞-categories, so that f is
accessible as well.

5.4.4 Accessibility of Functor ∞-Categories

Let C be an accessible ∞-category, and let K be a small simplicial set. Our goal in this section is to prove
that Fun(K, C) is accessible (Proposition 5.4.4.3). In §5.4.7, we will prove a much more general stability
result of this kind (Corollary 5.4.7.17), but the proof of that result ultimately rests on the ideas presented
here.

Our proof goes roughly as follows. If C is accessible, then C has a many τ -compact objects, provided
that τ is suﬃciently large. Using Proposition 5.3.4.13, we deduce the existence of many τ -compact objects
in Fun(K, C). Our main problem is to show that these objects generate Fun(K, C) under τ -ﬁltered colimits.
To prove this, we will use a rather technical coﬁnality result (Lemma 5.4.4.2 below). We begin with the
following prelimiinary observation:

Lemma 5.4.4.1. Let τ be a regular cardinal, and let q : Y → X be a coCartesian ﬁbration with the property
that for every vertex x of X, the ﬁber Yx = Y ×X {x} is τ -ﬁltered. Then q has the right lifting property with
respect to K ⊆ K ⊲, for every τ -small simplicial set K.

C →

D lifting

Proof. Using Proposition A.2.3.1, we can reduce to the problem of showing that q has the right lifting
property with respect to the inclusion K ⊆ K ⋄ ∆0. In other words, we must show that given any edge
C of Y K lifting C, there exists an edge
e : C → D in X K, where D is a constant map, and any vertex
D′
e :
e′ to be qK-coCartesian,
lifting e (since the map qK : Y K → X K is a coCartesian ﬁbration, we can even choose
though we will not need this). Suppose that D takes the constant value x : ∆0 → X. Since the ﬁber Yx
e

e
D is a constant map from K to Yx. We now
is τ -ﬁltered, there exists an edge
e
invoke the fact that qK is an inner ﬁbration to supply the dotted arrow in the diagram

D is a constant map from K to Y . We ﬁrst choose an arbitrary edge

Lemma 5.4.4.2. Let κ < τ be regular cardinals. Let q : Y → X be a map of simplicial sets with the
following properties:

e

(i) The simplicial set X is τ -small.

(ii) The map q is a coCartesian ﬁbration.

(iii) For every vertex x ∈ X, the ﬁber Yx = Y ×X {x} is τ -ﬁltered and admits τ -small, κ-ﬁltered colimits.

(iv) For every edge e : x → y in X, the associated functor Yx → Yy preserves τ -small, κ-ﬁltered colimits.

Then:

(1) The ∞-category C = Map/X (X, Y ) of sections of q is τ -ﬁltered.

(2) For each vertex x of X, the evaluation map ex : C → Yx is coﬁnal.

Proof. Choose a categorical equivalence X → M , where M is a minimal ∞-category. Since τ is uncountable,
Proposition 5.4.1.2 implies that M is τ -small. According to Corollary 3.3.1.2, Y is equivalent to the pullback
of a coCartesian ﬁbration Y ′ → M . We may therefore replace X by M and thereby reduce to the case where
X is a minimal ∞-category. For each ordinal α, let (α) = {β < α}.

Let K be a τ -small simplicial set equipped with a map f : K → Y . We deﬁne a new object K ′

X ∈ (Set∆)/X
X is determined by the following

as follows. For every ﬁnite, nonempty, linearly ordered set J, a map ∆J → K ′
data:

• A map χ : ∆J → X.

• A map ∆J → ∆2, corresponding to a decomposition J = J0

J2.

• A map ∆J0 → K.

• An order-preserving map m : J1 → (κ), having the property that if m(i) = m(j), then χ(∆{i,j}) is a

degenerate edge of X.

We will prove the existence of a dotted arrow F ′

Let K ′′ ⊆ K ′
X be the simplicial subset corresponding to simplices, as above, where J1 = ∅, and let F ′′ =
X |K ′′. Specializing to the case where K = Z × X, Z a τ -small simplicial set, we will deduce that any
F ′
diagram Z → C extends to a map Z ⊲ → C (given by F ′′), which proves (1). Similarly, by specializing
Z×{x}(Z ⊳ × {x}), we will deduce that for every object y ∈ Y with q(y) = x,
to the case K = (Z × X)
the ∞-category C ×Yx(Yx)y/ is τ -ﬁltered, and therefore weakly contractible. Applying Theorem 4.1.3.1, we
deduce (2).

`

It remains to construct the map F ′

X . There is no harm in enlarging K. We may therefore apply the
small object argument to replace K by an ∞-category (which we may also suppose is τ -small, since τ is
uncountable). We begin by deﬁning, for each α ≤ κ, a simplicial subset K(α) ⊆ K ′
X . The deﬁnition is as
follows: we will say that a simplex ∆J → K ′
X factors through K(α) if, in the corresponding decomposition
J2, we have J2 = ∅, and the map J1 → (κ) factors through (α). Our ﬁrst task is to construct
J1
J = J0
F (α) = F ′
X |K(α), which we do by induction on α. If α = 0, K(α) = K and we set F (0) = f . When α is a
`
β<α F (β). It therefore suﬃces to construct
limit ordinal, we have K(α) =
F (α + 1), assuming that F (α) has already been constructed. For each vertex x of X, let
x = (x, α) denote
the unique vertex of K(α + 1) lying over x which does not belong to K(α). Since X is minimal, Proposition
2.3.3.9 implies that we have a pushout diagram

β<α K(β) and we set F (α) =

Then σ factors through K ′
to extend the deﬁnition of F ′

X ′ if and only if the induced map ∆J2 → X factors through X ′. Our next job is

X from K ′

∅ = K(κ) to K ′

X, by adjoining simplices to X one at a time.

Let F ′

∅ = F (κ), and let x be a vertex of X. We begin by deﬁning a map F ′

We will choose px to be a relative colimit of px over X (see §4.3.1). To prove that such a relative colimit
exists, we consider the inclusion ix : N(κ) ⊆ K(κ)/x ×X/x {idx} ⊆ K(κ)/x. Using Proposition 2.3.3.9, it
is not diﬃcult to see that K(κ)/x is an ∞-category. For each object y ∈ K(κ)/x, the minimality of X
implies that N(κ) ×K/x (K/x)y/ is isomorphic to N({α : β < α < κ}) for some β < κ, and therefore weakly
contractible. Theorem 4.1.3.1 implies that ix is coﬁnal. Invoking Proposition 4.3.1.8, it will suﬃce to prove
that px ◦ ix : N(κ) → Y admits a relative colimit over X. Using conditions (ii), (iv), and Proposition
4.3.1.10, we may reduce to producing a colimit of px ◦ ix in the ∞-category Yx, which is possible in virtue
of assumption (iii).

Applying the above argument separately to each vertex of X, we may suppose that F ′

X (0) has been
constructed, where X (0) denotes the 0-skeleton of X. We now consider the collection of all pairs (X ′, F ′
X ′ )
where X ′ is a simplicial subset of X containing all vertices of X, and F ′
X ′ : KX ′ → Y is a map over X
whose restriction to KX 0 coincides with F ′
X ′ ) ≤
(X ′′, F ′
X ′′ ) to mean that X ′ ⊆ X ′′ and F ′
X ′ . The hypotheses of Zorn’s lemma are satisﬁed, so
that there exists a maximal such pair (X ′, F ′
X ′ ). To complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that X ′ = X.
If not, we can choose X ′ ⊆ X ′′ ⊆ X, where X ′′ is obtained from X ′ by adjoining a single nondegenerate
simplex σ : ∆n → X whose boundary already belongs to X ′. Since X ′ contains X (0), we may suppose that
n > 0. Let K(κ)/σ = K(κ) ×X X/σ, and let x = σ(0). Since X is minimal, we have a pushout diagram

X (0) . This collection is partially ordered, if we write (X ′, F ′

where s′ is a q-colimit diagram by construction. According to Proposition 4.3.1.7, it will suﬃce to show that

K(κ)/σ

where the lower horizontal map is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. It follows that the upper horizontal
map is a trivial ﬁbration, and in particular coﬁnal. Consequently, there exists an extension FX ′′ of FX ′ ,
which contradicts the maximality of (X ′, FX ′ ) and completes the proof.

Proposition 5.4.4.3. Let C be an accessible ∞-category, and let K be a small simplicial set. Then Fun(K, C)
is accessible.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that K is an ∞-category. Choose a regular cardinal κ
such that C admits small κ-ﬁltered colimits, and choose a second regular cardinal τ > κ such that C is also τ -
accessible and K is τ -small. We will prove that Fun(K, C) is τ -accessible. Let C′ = Fun(K, Cτ ) ⊆ Fun(K, C).
It is clear that C′ is essentially small. Proposition 5.1.2.2 implies that Fun(K, C) admits small τ -ﬁltered
colimits, and Proposition 5.3.4.13 asserts that C′ consists of τ -compact objects of Fun(K, C). According to
Proposition 5.4.2.2, it will suﬃce to prove that C′ generates Fun(K, C) under small, τ -ﬁltered colimits.

Without loss of generality, we may suppose that C = Indτ D′, where D′ is a small ∞-category. Let D ⊆ C
denote the essential image of the Yoneda embedding. Let F : K → C be an arbitrary object of CK, and let
Fun(K, D)/F = Fun(K, D) ×Fun(K,C) Fun(K, C)/F . Consider the composite diagram

p : Fun(K, D)/F ⋄ ∆0 → Fun(K, C)/F ⋄ ∆0 → Fun(K, C).

The ∞-category Fun(K, D)/F is equivalent to Fun(K, D′) ×Fun(K,C) Fun(K, C)/F , and therefore essentially
small. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that Fun(K, D)/F is τ -ﬁltered, and that p is a colimit
diagram.

We may identify F with a map fK : K → C ×K in (Set∆)/K. According to Proposition 4.2.2.4, we
obtain a coCartesian ﬁbration q : (C ×K)/fK → K, and the q-coCartesian morphisms are precisely those
which project to equivalences in C. Let X denote the full subcategory of (C ×K)/fK consisting of those
objects whose projection to C belongs to D. It follows that q′ = q|X : X → K is a coCartesian ﬁbration. We
may identify the ﬁber of q′ over a vertex x ∈ K with D/F (x) = D ×C C/F (x). It follows that the ﬁbers of q′
are τ -ﬁltered ∞-categories; Lemma 5.4.4.2 now guarantees that Fun(K, D)/F ≃ Map/K(K, X) is τ -ﬁltered.
According to Proposition 5.1.2.2, to prove that p is a colimit diagram, it will suﬃce to prove that for
every vertex x of K, the composition of p with the evaluation map ex : Fun(K, C) → C is a colimit diagram.
The composition ex ◦ p admits a factorization

Fun(K, D)/F ⋄ ∆0 → D/F (x) ⋄∆0 → C

where D/F (x) = D ×C C/F (x) and the second map is a colimit diagram in C by Lemma 5.1.5.3.
It will
therefore suﬃce to prove that the map gx : Fun(K, D)/F → D/F (x) is coﬁnal, which follows from Lemma
5.4.4.2.

5.4.5 Accessibility of Undercategories

Let C be an accessible ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a small diagram. Our goal in this section is to
prove that the ∞-category Cp/ is accessible (Corollary 5.4.5.16).

Remark 5.4.5.1. The analogous result for the ∞-category C/p will be proven in §5.4.6, using Propositions
5.4.4.3 and 5.4.6.6. It is possible to use the same argument to give a second proof of Corollary 5.4.5.16;
however, we will need Corollary 5.4.5.16 in our proof of Proposition 5.4.6.6.

We begin by studying the behavior of colimits with respect to (homotopy) ﬁber products of ∞-categories.

Lemma 5.4.5.2. Let

q′

be a diagram of ∞-categories which is homotopy Cartesian (with respect to the Joyal model structure).
Suppose that X and Y have initial objects, and that p and q preserve initial objects. An object X ′ ∈ X′ is
initial if and only if p′(X ′) is an initial object of Y′ and q′(X ′) is an initial object of X. Moreover, there
exists an initial object of X′.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that p and q are categorical ﬁbrations, and that X′ =
X ×Y Y′. Suppose ﬁrst that X ′ is an object of X′ with the property that X = q′(X ′) and Y ′ = p′(X ′) are
initial objects of X and Y′. Then Y = p(X) = q(Y ′) is an initial object of Y. Let Z be another object of X′.
We have a pullback diagram of Kan complexes

HomR

Y′ (Y ′, p′(Z))

/ HomR

Y (Y, (q ◦ p′)(Z)).

X(X, q′(Z)), HomR

Since the maps p and q are inner ﬁbrations, Lemma 2.4.4.1 implies that this diagram is homotopy Cartesian
(with respect to the usual model structure on Set∆). Since X, Y ′, and Y are initial objects, the Kan
complexes HomR
Y (Y, (q ◦ p′)(Z)) are contractible. It follows that
HomR

X′(X ′, Z) is contractible as well, so that X ′ is an initial object of X′.
We now prove that there exists an object X ′ ∈ X′ such that p′(X ′) and q′(X ′) are initial. The above
argument shows that X ′ is an initial obejct of X′. Since all initial objects of X′ are equivalent, this will prove
that for any initial object X ′′ ∈ X′, the objects p′(X ′′) and q′(X ′′) are initial.

Y′(Y ′, p′(Z)), and HomR

We begin by selecting arbitrary initial objects X ∈ X and Y ∈ Y′. Then p(X) and q(Y ) are both initial
objects of Y, so there is an equivalence e : p(X) → q(Y ). Since q is a categorical ﬁbration, there exists an
equivalence e : Y ′ → Y in Y such that q(e) = e. It follows that Y ′ is an initial object of Y′ with q(Y ′) = p(X),
so that the pair (X, Y ′) can be identiﬁed with an object of X′ which has the desired properties.

Lemma 5.4.5.3. Let p : X → Y be a categorical ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let f : K → X be a diagram.
Then the induced map p′ : Xf / → Ypf / is a categorical ﬁbration.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that p′ has the right lifting property with respect to every inclusion A ⊆ B which is
a categorical equivalence. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, it suﬃces to show that p has the right lifting property
with respect to i : K ⋆ A ⊆ K ⋆ B. This is immediate, since p is a categorical ﬁbration and i is a categorical
equivalence.

be a diagram of ∞-categories which is homotopy Cartesian (with respect to the Joyal model structure), and
let κ be a regular cardinal. Suppose that X and Y′ admit small κ-ﬁltered colimits, and that p and q preserve
small κ-ﬁltered colimits. Then:

(1) The ∞-category X′ admits small κ-ﬁltered colimits.

(2) If X ′ is an object of X′ such that Y ′ = p′(X ′) and X = q′(X ′), and Y = p(X) = q(Y ′) are κ-compact,

then X ′ is a κ-compact object of X′.

Proof. Claim (1) follows immediately from Lemma 5.4.5.5. To prove (2), consider a colimit diagram f :
I⊲ → X′. We wish to prove that the composition of f with the functor X′ →
S corepresented by X ′ is also
a colimit diagram. Using Proposition 5.3.1.16, we may assume without loss of generality that I is the nerve
of a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set A. We may further suppose that p and q are categorical ﬁbrations and
that X′ = X ×Y Y′. Let I⊲

of (weakly) ﬁbrant objects of (Set∆)A∪{∞}. Moreover, the simplicial nerve of each FZ can be identiﬁed with
the composition of f with the functor corepresented by Z. According to Theorem 4.2.4.1, it will suﬃce to
show that FX ′ is a homotopy colimit diagram. We now observe that FX , FY ′, and FY are homotopy colimit
diagrams (since X, Y ′, and Y are assumed to be κ-compact) and conclude by applying Lemma 5.4.5.6.

In some of the arguments below, it will be important to be able to replace colimits of a diagram J → C
by colimits of some composition I f
→ J → C. According to Proposition 4.1.1.8, this maneuver is justiﬁed
provided that f is coﬁnal. Unfortunately, the class of coﬁnal morphisms is not suﬃciently robust for our
purposes. We will therefore introduce a property somewhat stronger than coﬁnality, which has better stability
properties.

Deﬁnition 5.4.5.8. Let f : I → J be a functor between ﬁltered ∞-categories. We will say that f is weakly
coﬁnal if, for every object J ∈ J, there exists an object I ∈ I and a morphism J → f (I) in J. We will say
that f is κ-coﬁnal if, for every diagram p : K → I where K is κ-small and weakly contractible, the induced
functor Ip/ → Jf p/ is weakly coﬁnal.

Example 5.4.5.9. Let I be a τ -ﬁltered ∞-category, and let p : K → I be a τ -small diagram. Then the
projection Ip/ → I is τ -coﬁnal. To prove this, consider a τ -small diagram K ′ → Ip/ where K ′ is weakly
contractible, corresponding to a map q : K ⋆ K ′ → I. According to Lemma 4.2.3.6, the inclusion K ′ ⊆ K ⋆ K ′
is right anodyne, so that the map Iq/ → Iq|K ′/ is a trivial ﬁbration (and therefore weakly coﬁnal).

Lemma 5.4.5.10. Let A, B, and C be simplicial sets, and suppose that B is weakly contractible. Then the
inclusion

and G preserve ﬁltered colimits and homotopy pushout squares, separately in each argument. Using standard
arguments (see, for example, the proof of Proposition 2.2.2.7), we can reduce to the case where A and C are
simplices.

Let us say that a simplicial set B is good if the inclusion F (A, B, C) ⊆ G(A, B, C) is a categorical

equivalence. We now make the following observations:

(1) Every simplex is good. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, this is equivalent to the assertion that for 0 ≤ m ≤

n ≤ p, the diagram

in which the vertical arrows are coﬁbrations, if B, B′, and B′′ are good, then B′′′ is good. This follows
from the compatibility of the functors F and G with homotopy pushouts in B.

(3) Every horn Λn

is good. This follows by induction on n, using (1) and (2).

(4) The collection of good simplicial sets is stable under ﬁltered colimits; this follows from the compatibility
of F and G with ﬁltered colimits, and the stability of categorical equivalences under ﬁltered colimits.

(5) Every retract of a good simplicial set is good (since the collection of categorical equivalences is stable

under the formation of retracts).

(6) If i : B → B′ is an anodyne map of simplicial sets, and B is good, then B′ is good. This follows by

combining observations (1) through (5).

(7) If B is weakly contractible, then B is good. To see this, choose a vertex b of B. The simplicial set

{b} ≃ ∆0 is good (by (1) ), and the inclusion {b} ⊆ B is anodyne. Now apply (6).

Lemma 5.4.5.11. Let κ and τ be regular cardinals, let f : I → J be a κ-coﬁnal functor between τ -ﬁltered
∞-categories, and let p : K → J be a κ-small diagram. Then:

(1) The ∞-category Ip/ = I ×J Jp/ is τ -ﬁltered.

(2) The induced functor Ip/ → Jp/ is κ-coﬁnal.

q : K ′ → Ip/ be a τ -small diagram, classifying a compatible pair of maps
Proof. We ﬁrst prove (1). Let
q : K ′ → I and q′ : K ⋆ K ′ → J. Since I is τ -ﬁltered, we can ﬁnd an extension q : (K ′)⊲ → I of q. To ﬁnd a

Lemma 4.2.3.6 implies that the inclusion K ′ ⊆ K ⋆ K ′ is right anodyne, so that the lower horizontal map is
a trivial ﬁbration. It follows that the upper horizontal map is also a trivial ﬁbration. Since f is κ-coﬁnal,
the right vertical map is weakly coﬁnal, so that the left vertical map is weakly coﬁnal as well.

Lemma 5.4.5.12. Let κ be a regular cardinal, and let f : I → J be an κ-coﬁnal map of ﬁltered ∞-categories.
Then f is coﬁnal.

Proof. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, to prove that f is coﬁnal it suﬃces to show that for every object J ∈ J,
the ﬁber product IJ/ = I ×J JJ/ is weakly contractible. Lemma 5.4.5.11 asserts that IJ/ is κ-ﬁltered; now
apply Lemma 5.3.1.18.

Lemma 5.4.5.13. Let κ be a regular cardinal, let C be an ∞-category which admits κ-ﬁltered colimits, let
p : K ⊲ → Cτ be a κ-small diagram in the ∞-category of κ-compact objects of C, and let p = p|K. Then p is
a κ-compact object of Cp/.

Proof. Let p′ denote the composition

K ⋄ ∆0 → K ⊲ p

→ Cκ;

it will suﬃce to prove that p′ is a τ -compact object of Cp/. Consider the pullback diagram

Cp/

Fun(K × ∆1, C)

/ Fun(K × {0}, C).

Corollary 2.4.7.12 implies that the f is a Cartesian ﬁbration, so we can apply Proposition 3.3.1.3 to deduce
that the diagram is homotopy Cartesian (with respect to the Joyal model structure). Using Proposition
5.1.2.2, we deduce that f preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits, and any functor ∗ → D preserves ﬁltered colimits
(since ﬁltered ∞-categories are weakly contractible; see §4.4.4). Consequently, Lemma 5.4.5.7 implies that
p′ is a κ-compact object of Cp/ provided that its images in ∗ and Fun(K × ∆1, C) are κ-compact. The former
condition is obvious, and the latter follows from Proposition 5.3.4.13.

Lemma 5.4.5.14. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small, τ -ﬁltered colimits, and let p : K → C be a
small diagram. Then Cp/ admits small, τ -ﬁltered colimits.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that K is an ∞-category. Let I be a τ -ﬁltered ∞-category
and q0 : I → Cp/ a diagram, corresponding to a diagram q : K ⋆ I → C. We next observe that K ⋆ I is small
and τ -ﬁltered, so that q admits a colimit q : (K ⋆ I)⊲ → C. The map q can also be identiﬁed with a colimit
of q0.

Proposition 5.4.5.15. Let τ ≫ κ be regular cardinals, let C be a τ -accessible ∞-category, and let p : K → Cτ
be a κ-small diagram. Then Cp/ is τ -accessible, and an object of Cp/ is τ -compact if and only if its image in
C is τ -compact.

Proof. Let D = Cp/ ×C Cτ be the full subcategory of Cp/ spanned by those objects whose image in C is τ -
compact. Since Cp/ is idempotent complete, and the collection of τ -compact objects of C is stable under the
formation of retracts, we conclude that D is idempotent complete. We also note that D is essentially small;
replacing C by a minimal model if necessary, we may suppose that D is actually small. Proposition 5.3.5.10
and Lemma 5.4.5.14 imply that there is an (essentially unique) τ -continuous functor F : Indτ (D) → Cp/
such that the composition D → Indτ (D) F→ Cp/ is equivalent to the inclusion of D in Cp/. To complete the
proof, it will suﬃce to show that F is an equivalence of ∞-categories. According to Proposition 5.3.5.11, it
will suﬃce to show that D consists of τ -compact objects of Cp/ and generates Cp/ under τ -ﬁltered colimits.
The ﬁrst assertion follows from Lemma 5.4.5.13.

To complete the proof, choose an object p : K ⊲ → C of Cp/, and let C ∈ C denote the image under p
/C . Since C is τ -accessible,
p/ is τ -ﬁltered and essentially small; to complete the
e

of the cone point of K ⊲. Then we may identify p with a diagram
the ∞-category E = Cτ
proof, it will suﬃce to show that the associated map

/C is τ -ﬁltered. It follows that E

is a colimit diagram. Equivalently, we must show that the compositition

K ⋆ E⊲
p/

the composition

q : E

The ∞-category E is τ -ﬁltered, so that E
p/ is also τ -ﬁltered, and therefore weakly contractible (Lemma
e
5.3.1.18). It follows that i is right anodyne (Lemma 4.2.3.6), and therefore coﬁnal. Applying Proposition
4.1.1.3, we conclude that θ0 is coﬁnal if and only if q is coﬁnal. We now observe that that q is τ -coﬁnal
(Example 5.4.5.9) and therefore coﬁnal (Lemma 5.4.5.12).

Corollary 5.4.5.16. Let C be an accessible ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a diagram indexed by a small
simplicial set K. Then Cp/ is accessible.

Proof. Choose appropriate cardinals τ ≫ κ and apply Proposition 5.4.5.15.

5.4.6 Accessibility of Fiber Products

Our goal in this section is to prove that the class of accessible ∞-categories is stable under (homotopy) ﬁber
products (Proposition 5.4.6.6). The strategy of proof should now be familiar from §5.4.4 and §5.4.5. Suppose
given a homotopy Cartesian diagram

of ∞-categories, where X, Y′, and Y are accessible ∞-categories, and the functors p and q are likewise
accessible. If κ is a suﬃciently large regular cardinal, then we can use Lemma 5.4.5.7 to produce a good
supply of κ-compact objects of X′. Our problem is then to prove that these objects generate X′ under
κ-ﬁltered colimits. This requires some rather delicate coﬁnality arguments.

Lemma 5.4.6.1. Let τ ≫ κ be regular cardinals, let f : C → D be a τ -continuous functor between τ -
accessible ∞-categories which carries τ -compact objects of C to τ -compact objects of D. Let C be an object of
C, Cτ
/f (C) the
full subcategory spanned by those objects D → f (C) where D ∈ D is τ -compact. Then f induces a κ-coﬁnal
functor f ′ : Cτ

weakly coﬁnal. Using Proposition 5.4.5.15, we may replace C by Cp/ and D by Df p/, and thereby reduce
to the problem of showing that f is weakly coﬁnal. Let φ : D → f (C) be an object of Dτ
/f (C), and let
FD : D → S be the functor corepresented by D. Since D is τ -compact, the functor FD is τ -continuous, so
that FD ◦ f is τ -continuous. Consequently, the space FD(f (C)) can be obtained as a colimit of the τ -ﬁltered
diagram

p/ → (Dτ

/f (C) → D FD→ S .

In particular, the path component of FD(f (C)) containing φ lies in the image of p(η), for some η : C′ → C
as above. It follows that there exists a commutative diagram

in D, which can be identiﬁed with a morphism in Dτ

/f (C) having the desired properties.

Lemma 5.4.6.2. Let A = A′ ∪ {∞} be a linearly ordered set containing a largest element ∞, and let B ⊆ A′
be a coﬁnal subset (in other words, for every α ∈ A′, there exists β ∈ B such that α ≤ β). The inclusion

φ : N(A′)

N(B ∪ {∞}) ⊆ N(A)

aN(B)

is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. For each β ∈ B, let φβ denote the inclusion

N({α ∈ A′ : α ≤ β})

N({α ∈ B : α ≤ β} ∪ {∞}) ⊆ N({α ∈ A′ : α ≤ β} ∪ {∞}).

aN({α∈B:α≤β})

Since B is coﬁnal in A′, φ is a ﬁltered colimit of the inclusions φβ . Replacing A′ by {α ∈ A′ : α ≤ β} and B
by {α ∈ B : α ≤ β}, we may reduce to the case where A′ has a largest element (which we will continue to
denote by β).

We have a categorical equivalence

Consequently, to prove that φ is a categorical equivalence, it will suﬃce to show that the composition

N({β, ∞}) ⊆ N(B ∪ {∞}).

Lemma 5.4.6.3. Let τ > κ be regular cardinals, and let

X p

→ Y p′

← X′

be functors between ∞-categories. Assume that:

(1) The ∞-categories X, X′, and Y are κ-ﬁltered, and admit τ -small, κ-ﬁltered colimits.

/
/
!
;
(2) The functors p and p′ preserve τ -small, κ-ﬁltered colimits.

(3) The functors p and p′ are κ-coﬁnal.

Then there exist objects X ∈ X, X ′ ∈ X′ such that p(X) and p′(X ′) are equivalent in Y.

Proof. For every ordinal α, we let [α] = {β : β ≤ α} and (α) = {β : β < α}. Let us say that an ordinal α
is even if it is of the form λ + n, where λ is a limit ordinal and n is an even integer; otherwise we will say
that α is odd. Let A denote the set of all even ordinals smaller than κ, and A′ the set of all odd ordinals
smaller than κ. We regard A and A′ as subsets of the linearly ordered set A ∪ A′ = (κ). We will construct
a commutative diagram

N(A)

N(κ)

N(A′)

p′

Supposing that this is possible, we choose colimits X ∈ X, X ′ ∈ X′, and Y ∈ Y for q, q′, and Q, respectively.
Since the inclusion N(A) ⊆ N(κ) is coﬁnal and p-preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits, we conclude that p(X) and Y
are equivalent. Similarly, p′(X ′) and Y are equivalent, so that p(X) and p′(X ′) are equivalent, as desired.

The construction of q, q′, and Q is given by induction. Let α < κ, and suppose that q| N({β ∈ A : β < α}),
q′| N({β ∈ A′ : β < α}) and Q| N(α) have already been constructed. We will show how to extend the
deﬁnitions of q, q′, and Q to include the ordinal α. We will suppose that α is even; the case where α is odd
is similar (but easier).

Suppose ﬁrst that α is a limit ordinal. In this case, deﬁne q| N({β ∈ A : β ≤ α}) to be an arbitrary
extension of q| N({β ∈ A : β < α}): such an extension exists in virtue of our assumption that X is κ-ﬁltered.
In order to deﬁne Q| N(α) it suﬃces to verify that Y has the extension property with respect to the inclusion

N(α)

N({β ∈ A : β ≤ α}) ⊆ N[α].

aN({β∈A:β<α})

Since Y is an ∞-category, this follows immediately from Lemma 5.4.6.2.

We now treat the case where α = α′ + 1 is a successor ordinal. Let q<α = q|{β ∈ A : β < α}, and regard
Q| N({α′} ∪ {β ∈ A : β < α}) as an object of Yf q<α/. We now observe that N({β ∈ A : β < α}) is κ-small
and weakly contractible. Since p is κ-coﬁnal, we can construct q|{β ∈ A : β ≤ α} extending q<α and a
compatible map Q| N({α′} ∪ {β ∈ A : β ≤ α}). To complete the construction of Q, it suﬃces to show that
Y has the extension property with respect to the inclusion

N(α)

N({β ∈ A : β ≤ α} ∪ {α′}) ⊆ N[α].

Once again, this follows from Lemma 5.4.6.2.

Proof. Choose a regular cardinal κ such that X, Y′, and Y are κ-accessible. Enlarging κ if necessary, we
may suppose that p and q are κ-continuous. It follows from Lemma 5.4.5.5 that X′ admits small κ-ﬁltered
colimits, and that for any κ′ > κ, a functor f : C → X is κ′-continuous if and only if p′ ◦ f and q′ ◦ f
are κ′-continuous. This proves the second claim; it now suﬃces to show that X′ is accessible. For this, we
will use characterization (3) of Proposition 5.4.2.2. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that p and
q are categorical ﬁbrations, and that X′ = X ×Y Y′. It then follows easily that X′ is locally small. It will
therefore suﬃce to show that there exists a regular cardinal τ such that X′ is generated by a small collection
of τ -compact objects under small, τ -ﬁltered colimits.

Since the ∞-categories of κ-compact objects of X and Y′ are essentially small, there exists τ > κ such
that p| Xκ ⊆ Yτ and q|Y′κ
⊆ Yτ . Enlarging τ if necessary, we may suppose that τ ≫ κ. The proof of
Proposition 5.4.2.11 shows that every τ -compact object of X can be written as a τ -small, κ-ﬁltered colimit
of objects belonging to Xκ. Since p is κ-continuous, it follows that p| Xτ ⊆ Yτ and similarly q|Y′τ
⊆ Yτ . Let
X′′ = Xτ ×Yτ Y′τ
. Then X′′ is an essentially small, full subcategory of X′. Lemma 5.4.5.7 implies that X′′
consists of τ -compact objects of X′. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that X′′ generates X′ under
small τ -ﬁltered colimits.

Let X ′ = (X, Y ′) be an object of X′, and let Y = pX = qY ′. We have a (homotopy) pullback diagram

X′′

of essentially small ∞-categories. Lemma 5.4.6.1 asserts that f and g are κ-coﬁnal. We apply Lemma 5.4.6.5
to conclude that X′′

/X ′ is τ -ﬁltered, and that f ′ and g′ are κ-coﬁnal. Now consider the diagram

Lemma 5.4.5.12 allows us to conclude that f ′ and g′ are coﬁnal, so that p′ ◦ h and q′ ◦ h are colimit diagrams.
Lemma 5.4.5.5 implies that h is a colimit diagram as well, so that X ′ is the colimit of an essentially small,
τ -ﬁltered diagram taking values in X′′.

Corollary 5.4.6.7. Let C be an accessible ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a diagram indexed by a small
simplicial set K. Then the ∞-category C/p is accessible.

Proof. Since the map C/p → C/p is a categorical equivalence, it will suﬃce to prove that C/p is accessible.
We have a pullback diagram

Proposition 5.1.2.2, we conclude that for every regular cardinal κ such that C admits κ-ﬁltered colimits, p
is κ-continuous; in particular, p is accessible. Corollary 5.4.3.6 implies that ∗ is accessible and that q is an
accessible functor. Applying Proposition 5.4.6.6, we deduce that C/p is accessible.

5.4.7 Applications

In §5.4.4 through §5.4.6, we established some of the basic stability properties enjoyed by the class of accessible
∞-categories. In this section, we will reap some of the rewards for our hard work.

Lemma 5.4.7.1. Let {Cα}α∈A be a family of ∞-categories indexed by a small set A, and let C =
be their coproduct. Then C is an accessible if and only if each Cα is accessible.

α∈A Cα

`

Proof. Immediate from the deﬁnitions.

α∈A Cα
Lemma 5.4.7.2. Let {Cα}α∈A be a family of ∞-categories indexed by a small set A, and let C =
be their product. If each Cα is accessible, then C is accessible. Moreover, if D is an accessible ∞-category,
then a functor D → C is accessible if and only if each of the compositions

Q

is accessible.

D → C → Cα

α∈A Cα. By Lemma 5.4.7.1, D is accessible. Let N(A) denote the constant simplicial set
Proof. Let D =
with value A. Proposition 5.4.4.3 implies that Fun(N(A), D) is accessible. We now observe that Fun(N(A), D)
can be written as a disjoint union of C with another ∞-category; applying Lemma 5.4.7.1 again, we deduce
that C is accessible. The second claim follows immediately from the deﬁnitions.

`

Proposition 5.4.7.3. The ∞-category Acc of accessible ∞-categories admits small limits, and the inclusion
i : Acc ⊆

Cat∞ preserves small limits.

d

Proof. By Proposition 4.4.2.6, it suﬃces to prove that Acc admits pullbacks and small products, and that
i preserves pullbacks and (small) products. Let Acc∆ be the (simplicial) subcategory of [Set∆ deﬁned as
follows:

(1) The objects of Acc∆ are the accessible ∞-categories.

(2) If C and D are accessible ∞-categories, then MapAcc∆ (C, D) is the subcategory of Fun(C, D) whose

objects are accessible functors, and whose morphisms are equivalences of functors.

The ∞-category Acc is isomorphic to the simplicial nerve N(Acc∆). In view of Theorem 4.2.4.1, it will suﬃce
to prove that the simplicial category Acc∆ admits homotopy ﬁber products and (small) homotopy products,
and that the inclusion Acc∆ ⊆ ([Set+
∆)◦ preserves homotopy ﬁber products and homotopy products. The
case of homotopy ﬁber products follows from Proposition 5.4.6.6 and the case of (small) homotopy products
follows from Lemma 5.4.7.2.

If C is an accessible ∞-category, then C is the union of full subcategories {Cτ ⊆ C}, where τ ranges over
all (small) regular cardinals. It seems reasonable to expect that if τ is suﬃciently large, then the properties
of C are mirrored by properties of Cτ . The following result provides an illustration of this philosophy:

Proposition 5.4.7.4. Let C be a κ-accessible ∞-category, and let τ ≫ κ be an uncountable regular cardinal
such that Cκ is essentially τ -small. Then the full subcategory Cτ ⊆ C is stable under all κ-small limits which
exist in C.

Before giving the proof, we will need to establish a few lemmas.

366

Lemma 5.4.7.5. Let τ ≫ κ be regular cardinals, and assume τ is uncountable. Let C be a τ -small ∞-
category, and let D be an object of Indκ(C). The following are equivalent:

(1) The object D is τ -compact in Indκ(C).

(2) For every C ∈ C, the space MapIndκ(C)(j(C), D) is essentially τ -small, where j : C → Indκ(C) denotes

the Yoneda embedding.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. Using Lemma 5.1.5.3, we can write D as the colimit of the κ-ﬁltered
diagram

C/D = C ×Indκ(C) Indκ(C)/D → Indκ(C).

Since τ ≫ κ, we also write D as a small τ -ﬁltered colimit of objects {Dα}, where each Dα is the colimit of
a τ -small, κ-ﬁltered diagram

C → C → Indκ(C).

Since D is τ -compact, we conclude that D is a retract of Dα. Let F : Indκ(C) → S denote the functor co-
represented by j(C). According to Proposition 5.3.5.5, F is κ-continuous. It follows that F (D) is a retract
of F (Dα), which is itself a τ -small colimit of spaces equivalent to MapIndκ(C)(j(C), j(C′)) ≃ MapC(C, C′),
which is essentially τ -small by assumption, and therefore a τ -compact object of S. It follows that D is also
τ -compact object of S.

e

Now assume (2). Once again, we observe that D can be obtained as the colimit of a diagram C/D →
Indκ(C). By assumption, C is τ -small and the ﬁbers of the right ﬁbration C/D → C are essentially τ -small.
Proposition 5.4.1.4 implies that C/D is essentially τ -small, so that D is a τ -small colimit of κ-compact objects
of Indκ(C) and therefore τ -compact.

Lemma 5.4.7.6. Let τ ≫ κ be regular cardinals such that τ is uncountable, and let Sτ be the full subcategory
of S consisting of essentially τ -small spaces. Then Sτ is stable under κ-small limits in S.

Proof. In view of Proposition 4.4.2.6, it suﬃces to prove that Sτ is stable under pullbacks and κ-small prod-
ucts. Using Theorem 4.2.4.1, it will suﬃce to show that the full subcategory of Kan spanned by essentially
τ -small spaces is stable under κ-small products and homotopy ﬁber products. This follows immediately from
characterization (1) given in Proposition 5.4.1.5.

Proof of Proposition 5.4.7.4. Let K be a κ-small simplicial set and let p : K → Cτ be a diagram which
admits a limit X ∈ C. We wish to show that X is τ -compact. According to Lemma 5.4.7.5, it suﬃces to
prove that the space F (X) is essentially τ -small, where F : C → S denotes the functor co-represented by a
κ-compact object C ∈ C. Since F preserves limits, we note that F (X) is a limit of F ◦ p. Lemma 5.4.7.5
implies that the diagram F ◦ p takes values in Sτ ⊆ S. We now conclude by applying Lemma 5.4.7.6.

We note the following useful criterion for establishing that a functor is accessible:

Proposition 5.4.7.7. Let G : C → C′ be a functor between accessible ∞-categories. If G admits a right or
a left adjoint, then G is accessible.

Proof. If G is a left adjoint, then G commutes with all colimits which exist in C. Therefore G is κ-continuous
for any cardinal κ having the property that C is κ-accessible. Let us therefore assume that G is a right
adjoint; choose a left adjoint F for G.

Choose a regular cardinal κ such that C′ is κ-accessible. We may suppose without loss of generality that

C′ = Indκ D, where D is a small ∞-category. Consider the composite functor

Since D is small, there exists a regular cardinal τ ≫ κ such that C is τ -accessible and the essential image of
F ◦ j consists of τ -compact objects of C. We will show that G is τ -continuous.

Since Indκ(D) ⊆ P(D) is stable under small τ -ﬁltered colimits, it will suﬃce to prove that the composition

Deﬁnition 5.4.7.8. Let C be an accessible category. A full subcategory D ⊆ C is an accessible subcategory
of C if D is accessible, and the inclusion of D into C is an accessible functor.

Example 5.4.7.9. Let C be an accessible ∞-category and K a simplicial set. Suppose that every diagram
K → C has a limit in C. Let D ⊆ Fun(K ⊳, C) be the full subcategory spanned by the limit diagrams. Then D
is equivalent to Fun(K, C), and is therefore accessible (Proposition 5.4.4.3). The inclusion D ⊆ Fun(K ⊳, C)
is a right adjoint, and therefore accessible (Proposition 5.4.7.7). Thus D is an accessible subcategory of
Fun(K ⊳, C). Similarly, if every diagram K → C has a colimit, then the full subcategory D′ ⊆ Fun(K ⊲, C)
spanned by the colimit diagrams in an accessible subcategory of Fun(K ⊲, C).

Proposition 5.4.7.10. Let C be an accessible category, and let {Dα ⊆ C}α∈A be a (small) collection of
accessible subcategories of C. Then

α∈A Dα is an accessible subcategory of C.

We conclude this chapter by establishing a generalization of Proposition 5.4.4.3.

Proposition 5.4.7.11. Let C be a subcategory of the ∞-category
categories satisfying the following conditions:

(a) The ∞-category C admits small limits, and the inclusion C ⊆

Cat∞ preserves small limits.

(b) If X belongs to C, then Fun(∆1, X) belongs to C.

(c) If X and Y belong to C, then a functor X → Fun(∆1, Y ) is a morphism of C if and only if, for every
vertex v of ∆1, the composite functor X → Fun(∆1, Y ) → Fun({v}, Y ) ≃ Y is a morphism of C.

Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets, where S is small. Assume that:

(i) The map p is a categorical ﬁbration and a locally coCartesian ﬁbration.

(ii) For each vertex s in S, the ﬁber Xs belongs to C.

(iii) For each edge s → s′ in S, the associated functor Xs → Xs′ is a morphism in C.

Let E be a set of edges of S, and let Y be the full subcategory of MapS(S, X) spanned by those sections
f : S → X of p which satisfy the following condition:

Then Y belongs to to C. Moreover, if Z ∈ C, then a functor Z → Y belongs to C if and only if, for every
vertex s in S, the composite map Z → Y → Xs belongs to C.

Remark 5.4.7.12. Hypotheses (i) through (iii) of Proposition 5.4.7.11 are satisﬁed, in particular, if p :
X → S is a coCartesian ﬁbration classiﬁed by a functor S → C ⊆

Remark 5.4.7.13. Hypotheses (a), (b), and (c) of Proposition 5.4.7.11 are satisﬁed for the following sub-
categories C ⊆

d

Cat∞:

d

• Fix a class of simplicial sets {Kα}α∈A. Then we can take C be the subcategory of

Cat∞ whose objects
are ∞-categories which admit Kα-indexed (co)limits, for each α ∈ A, and whose morphisms are functors
which preserves Kα-indexed (co)limits, for each α ∈ A.

d

• We can take the objects of C to be accessible ∞-categories, and the morphisms in C to be accessible

functors (in view of Propositions 5.4.4.3 and 5.4.7.3).

We will meet some other examples in §5.5.

Remark 5.4.7.14. In the situation of Proposition 5.4.7.11, we can replace “coCartesian” by “Cartesian”
everywhere to obtain a dual result. This follows by applying Proposition 5.4.7.11 to the map X op → Sop,
after replacing C by its preimage under the “opposition” involution of h

Cat∞.

The proof of Proposition 5.4.7.11 makes use of the following observation:

Lemma 5.4.7.15. Let p : M → ∆1 be a coCartesian ﬁbration, classifying a functor F : C → D, where
C = p−1{0} and D = p−1{1}. Let X = Map∆1(∆1, M) be the ∞-category of sections of p. Then X can be
identiﬁed with a homotopy limit of the diagram

C F→ Fun({0}, D) ← Fun(∆1, D).

Proof. We ﬁrst replace the diagram in question by a ﬁbrant one. Let C′ denote the ∞-category of coCartesian
sections of p. Then the evaluation map e : C′ → C is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Moreover, since F
is associated to the correspondence M, the map e admits a section s such that the composition

coincides with F . It follows that we have a weak equivalence of diagrams

diagram, which we can identify with the full subcategory of Map∆1(Λ2

carry the ﬁrst edge of Λ2

Regard ∆2 as an object of (Set∆)/∆1 via the unique retraction r : ∆2 → ∆1 onto the simplicial subset
∆{0,1} ⊆ ∆{0,1,2}. Let X′′ denote the full subcategory of Map∆1(∆2, M) spanned by those maps ∆2 → M
which carry the initial edge of ∆2 to a p-coCartesian edge of M.

X ← X′′ → X′

are trivial ﬁbrations of simplicial sets. It follows that X and X′ are (canonically) homotopy equivalent, as
desired.

Remark 5.4.7.16. In the situation of Lemma 5.4.7.15, the full subcategory of X spanned by the coCartesian
sections of p is equivalent (via evaluation at {0}) to C.

Proof of Proposition 5.4.7.11. Let us ﬁrst suppose that E = ∅. Let skn S denote the n-skeleton of S. We
observe that MapS(S, X) coincides with the (homotopy) inverse limit

{MapS(skn S, X)}.

In view of assumption (a), it will suﬃce to prove the result after replacing S by skn S. In other words, we
may reduce to the case where S is n-dimensional.

We now work by induction on n, and observe that there is a homotopy pushout diagram of simplicial

sets

We therefore obtain a homotopy pullback diagram of ∞-categories

Invoking assumption (a) again, we are reduced to proving the same result after replacing S by skn−1 S,
Sn × ∂ ∆n, and Sn × ∆n. The ﬁrst two cases follow from the inductive hypothesis; we may therefore assume
that S is a disjoint union of copies of ∆n. Applying (a) once more, we can reduce to the case S = ∆n.

If n = 0, there is nothing to prove. If n > 1, then we have a trivial ﬁbration

MapS(S, X) → MapS(Λn

Since the horn Λn

In view of (a), it will suﬃce to prove that all of the ∞-categories and functors in the above diagram belong
to C. This follows immediately from (b) and (c).

We now consider the general case where E is not required to be empty. For each edge e ∈ E, let Y (e)

(2′) Given an object Z ∈ C, a functor Z → Fun′(∆1, Xs′ ) is a morphism in C if and only if the induced

These assertions follow immediately from (b) and (c), respectively.

Corollary 5.4.7.17. Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets which is a coCartesian ﬁbration (or a

(2) For each vertex s of S, the ∞-category Xs = X ×S {s} is accessible.

(3) For each edge e : s → s′ of S, the associated functor Xs → Xs′ (or Xs′ → Xs) is accessible.

5.5 Presentable ∞-Categories

Our ﬁnal object of study in this chapter is the theory of presentable ∞-categories.

Deﬁnition 5.5.0.18. An ∞-category C is presentable if C is accessible and admits small colimits.

We will begin in §5.5.1 by giving a number of equivalent reformulations of Deﬁnition 5.5.0.18. The main
result, Theorem 5.5.1.1, is due to Carlos Simpson: an ∞-category C is presentable if and only if it arises as
an (accessible) localization of an ∞-category of presheaves.

Let C be an ∞-category, and let F : C → Sop be a functor. If F is representable by an object of C,
then F preserves colimits (Proposition 5.1.3.2). In §5.5.2, we will prove that the converse holds when C is
presentable. This representability criterion has a number of consequences: it implies that C admits (small)
limits (Corollary 5.5.2.4), and leads to an ∞-categorical analogue of the adjoint functor theorem (Corollary
5.5.2.9).

In §5.5.3, we will see that the collection of all presentable ∞-categories can be organized into an ∞-
category PrL. Moreover, we will explain how to compute limits and colimits in PrL. In the course of doing
so, we will prove that the class of presentable ∞-categories is stable under most of the basic constructions
of higher category theory.

In view of Theorem 5.5.1.1, the theory of localizations plays a central role in the study of presentable
∞-categories. In §5.5.4, we will show that the collection of all (accessible) localizations of a presentable
∞-category C can be parametrized in a very simple way. Moreover, there is a good supply of localizations of
C: given any (small) collection of morphisms S of C, one can construct a corresponding localization functor

C L→ S−1 C ⊆ C,

where S−1 C is a the full subcategory of C spanned by the S-local objects. These ideas are due to Bousﬁeld,
who works in the setting of model categories; we will give an exposition here in the language of ∞-categories.
In §5.5.5, we will employ the same techniques to produce examples of factorization systems on the ∞-category
C.

Let C be an ∞-category, and let C ∈ C be an object. We will say that C ∈ C is discrete if, for every
D ∈ C, the nonzero homotopy groups of the mapping space MapC(D, C) vanish. If we let τ≤0 C denote the
full subcategory of C spanned by the discrete objects, then τ≤0 C is (equivalent to) an ordinary category. If
C is the ∞-category of spaces, then we can identify the discrete objects of C with the ordinary category of
sets. Moreover, the inclusion τ≤0 S ⊆ S has a left adjoint, given by

X 7→ π0X.

In §5.5.6, we will show that the preceding remark generalizes to an arbitrary presentable ∞-category C:
the discrete objects of C constitute an (accessible) localization of C. We will also consider a more general
condition of k-truncatedness (which specializes to the condition of discreteness when k = 0). The truncation
functors which we construct will play an important role throughout §6.

In §5.5.7, we will study the theory of compactly generated ∞-categories: ∞-categories which are generated
(under colimits) by their compact objects. This class of ∞-categories includes some of the most important
examples, such as S and Cat∞. In fact, the ∞-category S satisﬁes an even stronger condition: it is generated
by compact projective objects (see Deﬁnition 5.5.8.18). The presence of enough compact projective objects
in an ∞-category allows us to construct projective resolutions, which gives rise to the theory of nonabelian
homological algebra (or “homotopical algebra”). We will review the rudiments of this theory in §5.5.8.
Finally, in §5.5.9 we will present the same ideas in a more classical form, following Quillen’s manuscript [63].
The comparison of these two perspectives is based on a rectiﬁcation result (Proposition 5.5.9.2) which is of
some independent interest.

Remark 5.5.0.19. We refer the reader to [1] for a study of presentability in the setting of ordinary category
theory. Note that [1] uses the term locally presentable categories for what we have chosen to call presentable
categories.

372

5.5.1 Presentability

Our main goal in this section is to establish the following characterization of presentable ∞-categories:

Theorem 5.5.1.1 (Simpson [70]). Let C be an ∞-category. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The ∞-category C is presentable.

(2) The ∞-category C is accessible, and for every regular cardinal κ, the full subcategory Cκ admits κ-small

colimits.

(3) There exists a regular cardinal κ such C is κ-accessible and Cκ admits κ-small colimits.

(4) There exists a regular cardinal κ, a small ∞-category D which admits κ-small colimits, and an equiv-

alence Indκ D → C.

(5) There exists a small ∞-category D such that C is an accessible localization of P(D).

(6) The ∞-category C is locally small, admits small colimits, and there exists a regular cardinal κ and a
(small) set S of κ-compact objects of C such that every object of C is a colimit of a small diagram
taking values in the full subcategory of C spanned by S.

Before giving the proof, we need a few preliminaries remarks. We ﬁrst observe that condition (5) is poten-
tially ambiguous: it is unclear whether the accessibility hypothesis is on C or on the associated localization
functor L : P(D) → P(D). The distinction turns out to be irrelevant, by virtue of the following:

Proposition 5.5.1.2. Let C be an accessible ∞-category, and let L : C → C be a functor satisfying the
equivalent conditions of Proposition 5.2.7.4. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The essential image L C of L is accessible.

(2) There exists a localization f : C → D, where D is accessible, and an equivalence L ≃ g ◦ f .

(3) The functor L is accessible (when regarded as a functor from C to itself).

Proof. Suppose (1) is satisﬁed. Then we may take D = L C, f = L, and g to be the inclusion L C ⊆ C; this
proves (2). If (2) is satisﬁed, then Proposition 5.4.7.7 shows that f and g are accessible functors, so their
composite g ◦ f ≃ L is also accessible; this proves (3). Now suppose that (3) is satisﬁed. Choose a regular
cardinal κ such that C is κ-accessible and L is κ-continuous. The full subcategory Cκ consisting of κ-compact
objects of C is essentially small, so there exists a regular cardinal τ ≫ κ such that LC is τ -compact for every
C ∈ Cκ. Let C′ denote the full subcategory of C spanned by the colimits of all τ -small, κ-ﬁltered diagrams
in Cκ, and let L C′ denote the essential image of C′ under L. We note that L C′ is essentially small. Since L
is κ-continuous, L C is stable under small κ-ﬁltered colimits in C. It follows that any τ -compact object of C
which belongs to L C is also τ -compact when viewed as an object of L C, so that L C′ consists of τ -compact
objects of L C. According to Proposition 5.4.2.2, to complete the proof that L C is accessible it will suﬃce
to show that L C′ generates L C under small, τ -ﬁltered colimits.

Let X be an object of C. Then X can be written as a small κ-ﬁltered colimit of objects of Cκ. The proof
of Proposition 5.4.2.11 shows that we can also write X as the colimit of a small τ -ﬁltered diagram in C′.
Since L is preserves colimits, it follows that LX can be obtaines as the colimit of a small τ -ﬁltered diagram
in L C′.

The proof of Theorem 5.5.1.1 will require a few easy lemmas:

Lemma 5.5.1.3. Let f : C → D be a functor between small ∞-category which exhibits D as an idempotent
completion of C, and let κ be a regular cardinal. Then Indκ(f ) : Indκ(C) → Indκ(D) is an equivalence of
∞-categories.

373

Proof. We ﬁrst apply Proposition 5.3.5.11 to conclude that Indκ(f ) is fully faithful. To prove that Indκ(f ) is
an equivalence, we must show that it generates Indκ(D) under κ-ﬁltered colimits. Since Indκ(D) is generated
under κ-ﬁltered colimits by the essential image of the Yoneda embedding jD : D → Indκ(D). Let D be an
object of D. Then D is a retract of f (C) for some object C ∈ C. Then jD(D) is a retract of (Indκ(f )◦jC)(C).
Since Indκ(C) is idempotent complete (Corollary 4.4.5.16), we conclude that jD(D) belongs to the essential
image of Indκ(f ).

Lemma 5.5.1.4. Let F : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories which admit small, κ-ﬁltered colimits,
and let G be a right adjoint to F . Suppose that G is κ-continuous. Then F carries κ-compact objects of C
to κ-compact objects of D.

Proof. Let C be a κ-compact object of C, eC : C →

functor corepresented by F (C). Since G is a right adjoint to F , we have an equivalence eF (C) = eC ◦ G. Since
eC and G are both κ-continuous, eF C is κ-continuous. It follows that F (C) is κ-compact, as desired.

Proof of Theorem 5.5.1.1. Corollary 5.3.4.15 asserts that the full subcategory Cκ is stable under all κ-small
colimits which exist in C. This proves that (1) implies (2). The implications (2) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (4) are obvious.
We next prove that (4) implies (5). According to Lemma 5.5.1.3, we may suppose without loss of generality
that D is idempotent complete. Let Pκ(D) denote the full subcategory of P(D) spanned by the κ-compact
objects, let D′ be a minimal model for Pκ(D), and let g denote the composition

D j

→ Pκ(D) → D′

where the second map is a homotopy inverse to the inclusion D′ ⊆ Pκ(D). Proposition 5.1.3.1 implies that g
is fully faithful and Proposition 5.3.4.18 implies that g admits a left adjoint f . It follows that F = Indκ(f )
and G = Indκ(g) are adjoint functors, and Proposition 5.3.5.11 implies that G is fully faithful. Moreover,
Proposition 5.3.5.12 implies that Indκ D′ is equivalent to P(D), so that C is equivalent to an accessible
localization of P(D′).

We now prove that (5) implies (6). Let D be a small ∞-category and L : P(D) → C an accessible
localization. Remark 5.2.7.5 implies that C admits small colimits and that C is generated under colimits by
the essential image of the composition

T : D j

→ P(D)

L
→ C .

To complete the proof of (6), it will suﬃce to show that there exists a regular cardinal κ such that the
essential image of T consists of κ-compact objects. Let G denote a left adjoint to L. By assumption, G
is an accessible functor so that there exists a regular cardinal κ such that G is κ-continuous. For each
object D ∈ D, the Yoneda image j(D) is a completely compact object of P(D), and in particular κ-compact.
Lemma 5.5.1.4 implies that T (D) is a κ-compact object of C.

We now complete the proof by showing that (6) ⇒ (1). Assume that there exists a regular cardinal κ and
a set S of κ-compact objects of C such that every object of C is a colimit of objects in S. Let C′ ⊆ C be the
full subcategory of C spanned by S, and let C′′ ⊆ C be the full subcategory of C spanned by the colimits of
all κ-small diagrams with values in C′′. Since C′ is essentially small, there is only a bounded number of such
diagrams up to equivalence, so that C′′ is essentially small. Moreover, since every object of C is a colimit of
a small diagram with values in C′, the proof of Corollary 4.2.3.11 shows that every object of C can also be
obtained as the colimit of a small κ-ﬁltered diagram with values in C′′. Corollary 5.3.4.15 implies that C′′
consists of κ-compact objects of C (a slightly more reﬁned argument shows that, if κ > ω, then C′′ consists
of precisely the κ-compact objects of C). We may therefore apply Proposition 5.4.2.2 to deduce that C is
accessible.

Remark 5.5.1.5. The characterization of presentable ∞-categories as localizations of presheaf ∞-categories
was established by Simpson in [70] (using a somewhat diﬀerent language). The theory of presentable ∞-
categories is essentially equivalent to the theory of combinatorial model categories (see §A.3.7 and Proposition
A.3.7.6). Since most of the ∞-categories we will meet are presentable, our study could also be phrased in

374

the language of model categories. However, we will try to avoid this language, since for many purposes the
restriction to presentable ∞-categories seems unnatural and is often technically inconvenient.

Remark 5.5.1.6. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and let D be an accessible localization of C. Then D
is presentable: this follows immediately from characterization (5) of Proposition 5.5.1.1.

Remark 5.5.1.7. Let C be a presentable ∞-category. Since C admits arbitrary colimits, it is “tensored over
spaces”, as we explained in §4.4.4. In particular, the homotopy category of C is naturally tensored over the
homotopy category H: for each object C of C and every simplicial set S, there exists an object C ⊗ S of C,
well deﬁned up to equivalence, equipped with isomorphisms

in the homotopy category H.

MapC(C ⊗ S, C′) ≃ MapC(C, C′)S

Example 5.5.1.8. The ∞-category S of spaces is presentable. This follows from characterization (1) of
Theorem 5.5.1.1, since S is accessible (Example 5.4.2.7) and admits (small) colimits by Corollary 4.2.4.8.

According to Theorem 5.5.1.1, if C is κ-accessible, then C admits small colimits if and only if the full
subcategory Cκ ⊆ C admits κ-small colimits. Roughly speaking, this is because arbitrary colimits in C can
be rewritten in terms of κ-ﬁltered colimits and κ-small colimits of κ-compact objects. Our next result is
another variation on this idea; it may also be regarded as an analogue of Theorem 5.5.1.1 (which describes
functors, rather than ∞-categories):

Proposition 5.5.1.9. Let f : C → D be a functor between presentable ∞-categories. Suppose that C is
κ-accessible. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The functor f preserves small colimits.

(2) The functor f is κ-continuous, and the restriction f | Cκ preserves κ-small colimits.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose C = Indκ(C′), where C′ is a small, idempotent complete
∞-category which admits κ-small colimits. The proof of Theorem 5.5.1.1 shows that the inclusion Indκ(C′) ⊆
P(C′) admits a left adjoint L. Let α : idP(C′) → L be a unit for the adjunction, and let f ′ : C′ → D denote
the composition of f with the Yoneda embedding j : Indκ(C′). According to Theorem 5.1.5.6, there exists a
colimit-preserving functor F : P(C′) → D and an equivalence of f ′ with F ◦ j. Proposition 5.3.5.10 implies
that f and F | Indκ(C) are equivalent; we may therefore assume without loss of generality that f = F | Indκ(C).
Let F ′ = f ◦ L, so that α induces a natural transformation β : F → F ′ of functors from P(C′) to D. We
will show that β is an equivalence. Consequently, we deduce that the functor F ′ is colimit preserving. It
then follows that f is colimit preserving. To see this, we consider an arbitrary diagram p : K → Indκ(C′)
and choose a colimit p : K ⊲ → P(C′). Then q = L ◦ p is a colimit diagram in Indκ(C′), and f ◦ q = F ′ ◦ p is
a colimit diagram in D. Since q = q|K is equivalent (via α) to the original diagram p, we conclude that f
preserves the colimit of p in Indκ(C′), as well.

It remains to prove that β is an equivalence of functors. Let E ⊆ P(C′) denote the full subcategory
spanned by those objects X ∈ P(C′) for which β(X) : F (X) → F ′(X) is an equivalence in D. We wish to
prove that E = P(C′). Since F and F ′ are both κ-continuous functors, E is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits
in P(C′). It will therefore suﬃce to prove that E contains Pκ(C′).

It is clear that E contains Indκ(C′);

in particular, E contains the essential image E′ of the Yoneda
embedding j : C′ → P(C′). According to Proposition 5.3.4.17, every object of Pκ(C′) is a retract of the
colimit of a κ-small diagram p : K → E′. Since C′ is idempotent complete, we may identify E′ with the full
subcategory of Indκ(C′) consisting of κ-compact objects. In particular, E′ is stable under κ-small colimits
and retracts in Indκ(C′). It follows that L restricts to a functor L′ : Pκ(C) → E′ which preserves κ-small
colimits.

375

To complete the proof that Pκ(C′) ⊆ E, it will suﬃce to prove that F ′| Pκ(C) preserves κ-small colimits.

To see this, we write F | Pκ(C′) as a composition

Pκ(C′)

→ E′ F | E′
L′

→ C,

where L′ preserves κ-small colimits (as noted above) and F | E′ = f | Cκ preserves κ-small colimits by assump-
tion.

5.5.2 Representable Functors and the Adjoint Functor Theorem

An object F of the ∞-category P(C) of presheaves on C is representable if it lies in the essential image of the
Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C). If F : Cop → S is representable, then F preserves limits: this follows from
the fact that F is equivalent to the composite map

Cop j

→ P(Cop) → S

where j denotes the Yoneda embedding for Cop (which is limit-preserving by Proposition 5.1.3.2) and the
right map is given by evaluation at C (which is limit-preserving by Proposition 5.1.2.2). If C is presentable,
then the converse holds.

Lemma 5.5.2.1. Let S be a small simplicial set, let f : S → S be an object of P(Sop), and let F : P(Sop) →
be the functor corepresented by f . Then the composition

is equivalent to f .

Proof. According to Corollary 4.2.4.7, we may can choose a (small) ﬁbrant simplicial category C and a
categorical equivalence φ : S → N(Cop) such that f is equivalent to the composition of ψop with the nerve of
a simplicial functor f ′ : C → Kan. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that f ′ ∈ SetC
∆ is projectively
coﬁbrant. Using Proposition 4.2.4.4, we have an equivalence of ∞-categories

We observe that the composition F ◦ψ can be identiﬁed with the simplicial nerve of the functor G : (SetC
Kan corepresented by f ′. The Yoneda embedding factors through ψ, via the adjoint of the composition

∆)◦ →

ψ : N(SetC

∆)◦) → P(S).

It follows that F ◦ j can be identiﬁed with the adjoint of the composition

j′ : C[S] → Cop → (SetC

∆)◦.

C[S]

j′
→ (SetC

∆)◦ G→ Kan .

This composition is equal to the functor f ′, so its simplicial nerve coincides with the original functor f .

Proposition 5.5.2.2. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and let F : Cop → S be a functor. The following
are equivalent:

(1) The functor F is representable by an object C ∈ C.

(2) The functor F preserves small limits.

376

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) was proven above (for an arbitrary ∞-category C). For the converse, we
ﬁrst treat the case where C = P(D), for some small ∞-category D. Let f : Dop → S denote the composition
of F with the (opposite) Yoneda embedding jop : Dop → P(D)op, and let F ′ : P(D)op →
S denote the
functor represented by f ∈ P(D). We will prove that F and F ′ are equivalent. We observe that F and
F ′ both preserve small limits; consequently, according to Theorem 5.1.5.6, it will suﬃce to show that the
compositions f = F ◦ jop and f ′ = F ′ ◦ jop are equivalent. This follows immediately from Lemma 5.5.2.1.

b

We now consider the case where C is an arbitrary presentable ∞-category. According to Theorem 5.5.1.1,
we may suppose that C is an accessible localization of a presentable ∞-category C′ which has the form P(D),
so that the assertion for C′ has already been established. Let L : C′ → C denote the localization functor. The
functor F ◦ Lop : (C′)op → S preserves small limits, and is therefore representable by an object C ∈ C′. Let
S denote the set of all morphisms φ in C′ such that L(φ) is an equivalence in C. Without loss of generality,
we may identify C with the full subcategory of C′ consisting of S-local objects. By construction, C ∈ C′ is
S-local and therefore belongs to C. It follows that C represents the functor (F ◦ Lop)| C, which is equivalent
to F .

The representability criterion of Proposition 5.5.2.2 has many consequences, as now explain.

Lemma 5.5.2.3. Let X and Y be simplicial sets, let C be an ∞-category, and let p : X ⊲ × Y ⊲ → C be a
diagram. Suppose that:

(1) For every vertex x of X ⊲, the associated map px : Y ⊲ → C is a colimit diagram.

(2) For every vertex y of Y , the associated map py : X ⊲ → C is a colimit diagram.

Let ∞ denote the cone point of Y ⊲. Then the restriction p∞ : X ⊲ → C is a colimit diagram.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that X and Y are ∞-categories. Since the inclusion
X × {∞} ⊆ X × Y ⊲ is coﬁnal, it will suﬃce to show that the restriction p|(X × Y ⊲)⊲ is a colimit diagram.
According to Proposition 4.3.2.9 p|(X × Y ⊲) is a left Kan extension of p|(X × Y ). By transitivity, it suﬃces
to show that p|(X × Y )⊲ is a colimit diagram. For this, it will suﬃce to prove the stronger assertion that
p|(X ⊲ × Y )⊲ is a left Kan extension of p|(X × Y ). Since Proposition 4.3.2.9 also implies that p|(X ⊲ × Y ) is a
left Kan extension of p|(X × Y ), we may again apply transitivity and reduce to the problem of showing that
p|(X ⊲×Y )⊲ is a colimit diagram. Let ∞′ denote the cone point of X ⊲. Since the inclusion {∞′}×Y ⊆ X ⊲×Y
is coﬁnal, we are reduced to proving that p∞′ : Y ⊲ → C is a colimit diagram, which follows from (1).

Corollary 5.5.2.4. A presentable ∞-category C admits all (small) limits.

P(C) = Fun(Cop,

S), where

S denotes the ∞-category of spaces which are not necessarily small,
Proof. Let
P(C) be the Yoneda embedding. Since j is fully faithful, it will suﬃce to show that the
and let j : C →
b
P(C) admits all small limits (in fact, even limits
essential image of j admits small limits. The ∞-category
which are not necessarily small); it therefore suﬃces to show that the essential image of j is stable under
small limits. This follows immediately from Proposition 5.5.2.2 and Lemma 5.5.2.3.

Remark 5.5.2.5. Let A be a (small) partially ordered set. The ∞-category N(A) is presentable if and only
if every subset of A has a least upper bound. Corollary 5.5.2.4 can then be regarded as a generalization of
the following classical observation: if every subset of A has a least upper bound, then every subset of A has
a greatest lower bound (namely, a least upper bound for the collection of all lower bounds).

Remark 5.5.2.6. Now that we know that every presentable ∞-category C has arbitrary limits, we can apply
an argument dual to that of Remark 5.5.1.7 to show that C is cotensored over S. In other words, for any
C ∈ C and every simplicial set X, there exists an object CX ∈ C (well deﬁned up to equivalence) together
with a collection of natural isomorphisms

in the homotopy category H.

MapC(C′, CX ) ≃ MapC(C′, C)X

377

We can now formulate a “dual” version of Proposition 5.5.2.2, which requires a slightly stronger hypoth-

esis.

Proposition 5.5.2.7. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and let F : C → S be a functor. Then F is
corepresentable by an object of C if and only if F is accessible and preserves small limits.

Proof. The “only if” direction is clear, since every object of C is κ-compact for κ ≫ 0. We will prove the
converse. Without loss of generality we may suppose that C is minimal (this assumption is a technical
convenience which will guarantee that various constructions below stay in the world of small ∞-categories).

P(Cκ). Since the ∞-category Cκ is idempotent complete and the Yoneda embedding j : Cκ → P(Cκ) is fully
faithful, we deduce that F | Cκ is equivalent to j(X ′), where X ′ ∈ Cκ is a retract of X. Let F ′ : C → S
denote the functor co-represented by X ′. We note that F | Cκ and F ′| Cκ are equivalent, and that both F
and F ′ are κ-continuous. Since C is equivalent to Indκ(Cκ), Proposition 5.3.5.10 guarantees that F and F ′
are equivalent, so that F is representable by X ′.

Remark 5.5.2.8. It is not diﬃcult to adapt our proof of Proposition 5.5.2.7 to obtain an alternative proof
of Proposition 5.5.2.2.

From Propositions 5.5.2.2 and 5.5.2.7 we can deduce a version of the adjoint functor theorem:

Corollary 5.5.2.9 (Adjoint Functor Theorem). Let F : C → D be functor between presentable ∞-categories.

(1) The functor F has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves small colimits.

(2) The functor F has a left adjoint if and only if it is accessible and preserves small limits.

Proof. The “only if” directions follow from Propositions 5.2.3.5 and 5.4.7.7. We now prove the converse
direction of (2); the proof of (1) is similar but easier. Suppose that F is accessible and preserves small
limits. Let F ′ : D → S be a corepresentable functor. Then F ′ is accessible and preserves small limits, by
Proposition 5.5.2.7. It follows that the composition F ′ ◦ F : C → S is accessible and preserves small limits.
Invoking Proposition 5.5.2.7 again, we deduce that F ′ ◦ F is representable. We now apply Proposition 5.2.4.2
to deduce that F has a left adjoint.

Remark 5.5.2.10. The proof of (1) in Corollary 5.5.2.9 does not require that D is presentable, but only
that D is (essentially) locally small.

5.5.3 Limits and Colimits of Presentable ∞-Categories

In this section, we will introduce an ∞-category whose objects are presentable ∞-categories, and study its
properties. In fact, we will introduce two such ∞-categories, which are (canonically) anti-equivalent to one
another. The basic observation is the following: given a pair of presentable ∞-categories C and D, the proper
notion of “morphism” between them is a pair of adjoint functors

Of course, either one of F and G determines the other up to canonical equivalence. We may therefore think
of either one as encoding the data of a morphism.

Deﬁnition 5.5.3.1. Let
subcategories PrR, PrL ⊆

(1) The objects of both PrR and PrL are the presentable ∞-categories.

Cat∞ denote the ∞-category of (not necessarily small) ∞-categories. We deﬁne
Cat∞ as follows:
d
d

(2) A functor F : C → D between presentable ∞-categories is a morphism in PrL if and only if F preserves

small colimits.

(3) A functor G : C → D between presentable ∞-categories is a morphism in PrR if and only if G is

accessible and preserves small limits.

As indicated above, the ∞-categories PrR and PrL are anti-equivalent to one another. To prove this, it

is convenient to introduce the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 5.5.3.2. A map of simplicial sets p : X → S is a presentable ﬁbration if it is both a Cartesian
ﬁbration and a coCartesian ﬁbration, and each ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s} is a presentable ∞-category.

The following result is simply a reformulation of Corollary 5.5.2.9:

Proposition 5.5.3.3.
χ : Sop →

(1) Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, classiﬁed by a map

Cat∞. Then p is a presentable ﬁbration if and only if χ factors through PrR ⊆

Cat∞.

(2) Let p : X → S be a coCartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, classiﬁed by a map χ : S →

d

is a presentable ﬁbration if and only if χ factors through PrL ⊆

Cat∞.

Corollary 5.5.3.4. For every simplicial set S, there is a canonical bijection

d

[S, PrL] ≃ [Sop, PrR]

Cat∞. Then p

d

d

where [S, C] denotes the collection of equivalence classes of objects of Fun(S, C). In particular, there is a
canonical isomorphism PrL ≃ (PrR)op in the homotopy category of ∞-categories.

Proof. According to Proposition 5.5.3.3, both [S, PrL] and [Sop, PrR] can be identiﬁed with the collection of
equivalence classes of presentable ﬁbrations X → S.

We now commence our study of the ∞-category PrL (or, equivalently, the anti-equivalent ∞-category
Cat∞ is stable under a variety of categorical

PrR). The next few results express the idea that PrL ⊆
constructions.

Proposition 5.5.3.5. Let {Cα}α∈A be a family of ∞-categories indexed by a small set A, and let C =

α∈A Cα be their product. If each Cα is presentable, then C is presentable.

Proof. It follows from Lemma 5.4.7.2 that C is accessible. Let p : K → C be a diagram indexed by a small
Q
simplicial set K, corresponding to a family of diagrams {pα : K → Cα}α∈A. Since each Cα is presentable,
each pα has a colimit pα : K ⊲ → Cα. These colimits determine a map p : K ⊲ → C which is a colimit of p.

Proposition 5.5.3.6. Let C be an presentable ∞-category, and let K be a small simplicial set. Then
Fun(K, C) is presentable.

Proof. According to Proposition 5.4.4.3, Fun(K, C) is accessible. It follows from Proposition 5.1.2.2 that if
C admits small colimits, then Fun(K, C) admits small colimits.

Remark 5.5.3.7. Let S be a (small) simplicial set. It follows from Example 5.4.2.7 and Corollary 5.1.2.4
that P(S) is a presentable ∞-category. Moreover, Theorem 5.1.5.6 has a natural interpretation in the
language of presentable ∞-categories: informally speaking, it asserts that the construction

S 7→ P(S)

is left adjoint to the inclusion functor from presentable ∞-categories to all ∞-categories.

The following is a variant on Proposition 5.5.3.6:

Proposition 5.5.3.8. Let C and D be presentable ∞-categories. The ∞-category FunL(C, D) is presentable.

Proof. Since D admits small colimits, the ∞-category Fun(C, D) admits small colimits (Proposition 5.1.2.2).
Using Lemma 5.5.2.3, we conclude that FunL(C, D) ⊆ Fun(C, D) is stable under small colimits. To complete
the proof, it will suﬃce to show that FunL(C, D) is accessible.

Choose a regular cardinal κ such that C is κ-accessible, and let Cκ be the full subcategory of C spanned

by the κ-compact objects. Propositions 5.5.1.9 and 5.3.5.10 imply that the restriction functor

FunL(C, D) → Fun(Cκ, D)

is fully faithful, and its essential image is the full subcategory E ⊆ Fun(Cκ, D) spanned by those functors
which preserve κ-small colimits.

Since Cκ is essentially small. the ∞-category Fun(Cκ, D) is accessible (Proposition 5.4.4.3). To complete
the proof, we will show that E is an accessible subcategory of Fun(Cκ, D). For each κ-small diagram p : K →
Cκ, let E(p) denote the full subcategory of Fun(Cκ, D) which preserve the colimit of p. Then E =
p E(p),
where the intersection is taken over a set of representatives for all equivalence classes of κ-small diagrams in
Cκ. According to Proposition 5.4.7.10, it will suﬃce to show that each E(p) is an accessible subcategory of
Fun(Cκ, D). We now observe that there is a (homotopy) pullback diagram of ∞-categories

T

E(p)(cid:127)

/ E′(p)(cid:127)

Fun(Cκ, D)

/ Fun(K ⊲, D)

where E′ denotes the full subcategory of Fun(K ⊲, D) spanned by the colimit diagrams. According to Propo-
sition 5.4.4.3, it will suﬃce to prove that E′(p) is an accessible subcategory of Fun(K ⊲, D), which follows
from Example 5.4.7.9.

Remark 5.5.3.9. In the situation of Proposition 5.5.3.8, the presentable ∞-category FunL(C, D) can be
regarded as an internal mapping object in PrL. For every presentable ∞-category C′, a colimit-preserving
functor C′ → FunL(C, D) can be identiﬁed with a bifunctor C × C′ → D, which is colimit-preserving separately
in each variable. There exists a universal recipient for such a bifunctor: a presentable category which we
may denote by C ⊗ C′. The operation ⊗ endows PrL with the structure of a symmetric monoidal ∞-category.
Proposition 5.5.3.8 can be interpreted as asserting that this monoidal structure is closed.

Proposition 5.5.3.10. Let C be an ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a diagram in C indexed by a (small)
simplicial set K. If C is presentable, then the ∞-category C/p is also presentable.

Proof. According to Corollary 5.4.6.7, C/p is accessible. The existence of small colimits in C/p follows from
Proposition 1.2.13.8.

Proposition 5.5.3.11. Let C be an ∞-category, and let p : K → C be a diagram in C indexed by a small
simplicial set K. If C is presentable, then the ∞-category Cp/ is also presentable.

Proof. It follows from Corollary 5.4.5.16 that Cp/ is accessible.
It therefore suﬃces to prove that every
diagram q : K ′ → Cp/ has a colimit in C. We now observe that (Cp/)q/ ≃ Cq′/ where q′ : K ⋆ K ′ → C is the
map classiﬁed by q. Since C admits small colimits, Cq′/ has an initial object.

be a diagram of ∞-categories which is homotopy Cartesian (with respect to the Joyal model structure).
Suppose further that X, Y, and Y′ are presentable, and that p and q are presentable functors. Then X′ is
presentable. Moreover, for any presentable ∞-category C and any functor f : C → X, f is presentable if
and only if the compositions p′ ◦ f and q′ ◦ f are presentable. In particular (taking f = idX), p′ and q′ are
presentable functors.

Proof. Proposition 5.4.6.6 implies that X′ is accessible.
It therefore suﬃces to prove that any diagram
f : K → X′ indexed by a small simplicial set K has a colimit in X′. Without loss of generality, we may
suppose that p and q are categorical ﬁbrations, and that X′ = X ×Y Y′. Let X be an initial object of Xq′◦f /
and let Y ′ be an initial object of Y′
p′f /. Since p and q preserve colimits, the images p(X) and q(Y ′) are
initial objects in Ypq′f /, and therefore equivalent to one another. Choose an equivalence η : p(X) → q(Y ′).
Since q is a categorical ﬁbration, η lifts to an equivalence η : Y → Y ′ in Y′
p′f / such that q(η) = η. Replacing
Y ′ by Y , we may suppose that p(X) = q(Y ) so that the pair (X, Y ) may be considered as an object of
X′
f /, so that f has a colimit
in X′. This completes the proof that X′ is accessible. The second assertion follows immediately from Lemma
5.4.5.5.

products. The desired result now follows by combining Propositions 5.5.3.12 and 5.5.3.5.

Corollary 5.5.3.14. Let p : X → S be a presentable ﬁbration of simplicial sets, where S is small. Then the
∞-category C of coCartesian sections of p is presentable.

Proof. According to Proposition 5.5.3.3, p is classiﬁed by a functor χ : S → PrL. Using Proposition 5.5.3.13,
we deduce that the limit of the composite diagram

Our goal, in the remainder of this section, is to prove the analogue of Proposition 5.5.3.13 for the ∞-
category PrR (which will show that PrL is equipped with all small colimits as well as all small limits). The
main step is to prove that for every small diagram S → PrR, the limit of the composite functor

S → PrR →

Cat∞

is presentable. As in the proof of Corollary 5.5.3.14, this is equivalent to the assertion that for any presentable
ﬁbration p : X → S, the ∞-category C of Cartesian sections of p is presentable. To prove this, we will show
that the ∞-category MapS(S, X) is presentable, and that C is an accessible localization of MapS(S, X).
Lemma 5.5.3.15. Let p : M → ∆1 be a Cartesian ﬁbration, let C denote the ∞-category of sections of
p, and let e : X → Y and e′ : X ′ → Y ′ be objects of C. If e′ is p-Cartesian, then the evaluation map
MapC(e, e′) → MapM(Y, Y ′) is a homotopy equivalence.

d

Proof. There is a homotopy pullback diagram of simplicial sets, whose image in the homotopy category H
is isomorphic to

MapC(e, e′)

MapM(Y, Y ′)

MapM(X, X ′)

/ MapM(X, Y ′).

If e′ is p-Cartesian, then the lower horizonal map is a homotopy equivalence, so the upper horizonal map is
a homotopy equivalence as well.

Lemma 5.5.3.16. Let p : M → ∆1 be a Cartesian ﬁbration. Let C denote the ∞-category of sections of p,
and C′ ⊆ C the full subcategory spanned by Cartesian sections of p. Then C′ is a reﬂective subcategory of C.

Proof. Let e : X → Y be an arbitrary section of p, and choose a Cartesian section e′ : X ′ → Y with the
same target. Since e′ is Cartesian, there exists a diagram

X

X ′

/ Y

idY

in M, which we may regard as a morphism φ from e ∈ C to e′ ∈ C′. In view of Proposition 5.2.7.8, it will
suﬃce to show that φ exhibits e′ as a C′-localization of C. In other words, we must show that for any Cartesian
section e′′ : X ′′ → Y ′′, composition with φ induces a homotopy equivalence MapC(e′, e′′) → MapC(e, e′′).
This follows immediately from Lemma 5.5.3.15.

Proposition 5.5.3.17. Let p : X → S be a presentable ﬁbration, where S is a small simplicial set. Then:

(1) The ∞-category C = MapS(S, X) of sections of p is presentable.
(2) The full subcategory C′ ⊆ C spanned by Cartesian sections of p is an accessible localization of C.

Proof. The accessibility of C follows from Corollary 5.4.7.17. Since p is a Cartesian ﬁbration and the ﬁbers
of p admit small colimits, C admits small colimits by Proposition 5.1.2.2. This proves (1).

For each edge e of S, let C(e) denote the full subcategory of C spanned by those maps S → X which
C(e). According to Lemma 5.5.4.18, it will suﬃce

carry e to a p-Cartesian edge of X. By deﬁnition, C′ =

S(∆1, X) ⊆ MapS(∆1, X) is an accessible localization of
MapS(∆1, X). In other words, we may suppose S = ∆1. It then follows that evaluation at {1} induces a
trivial ﬁbration C′ → X ×S {1}, so that C′ is presentable. It therefore suﬃces to show that C′ is a reﬂective
subcategory of C, which follows from Lemma 5.5.3.16.

Proof. Let χ : Sop → PrR be a small diagram, and let χ : (S⊲)op →

Cat∞ and that χ is a limit when regarded as a diagram in PrR.

d

We ﬁrst show that χ carries each vertex to a presentable ∞-category. This is clear with the exception of
the cone point of (S⊲)op. Let p : X → S be a presentable ﬁbration classiﬁed by χ. According to Corollary
3.3.3.2, we may identify the image of the cone point under χ with the ∞-category C of Cartesian sections of
p. Proposition 5.5.3.17 implies that this ∞-category is presentable.

d

We next show that χ carries each edge of (S⊲)op to an accessible, limit-preserving functor. This is clear
for edges which are degenerate or belong to Sop. The remaining edges are in bijection with the vertices
of s, and connect those vertices to the cone point. The corresponding functors can be identiﬁed with the
composition

C ⊆ MapS(S, X) → Xs,
where the second functor is given by evaluation at s. Proposition 5.5.3.17 implies that the inclusion i : C ⊆
MapS(S, X) is accessible and preserves small limits, and Proposition 5.1.2.2 implies that the evaluation map
MapS(S, X) → Xs preserves all limits and colimits. This completes the proof that χ factors through PrR.
Cat∞ and χ is already a

We now show that χ is a limit diagram in PrR. Since PrR is a subcategory of
Cat∞, it will suﬃce to verify the following assertion:

Applying Proposition 5.5.3.17, we see that F is accessible and limit preserving if and only if i ◦ F is

accessible and limit preserving. We now conclude by applying Proposition 5.1.2.2.

5.5.4 Local Objects

According to Theorem 5.5.1.1, every presentable ∞-category arises as an (accessible) localization of some
presheaf ∞-category P(X). Consequently, understanding the process of localization is of paramount impor-
tance in the study of presentable ∞-categories. In this section, we will classify the accessible localizations of
an arbitrary presentable ∞-category C. The basic observation is that a localization functor L : C → C is de-
termined, up to equivalence, by the collection S of all morphisms f such that Lf is an equivalence. Moreover,
a collection of morphisms S arises from an accessible localization functor if and only if S is strongly saturated
(Deﬁnition 5.5.4.5) and of small generation (Remark 5.5.4.7). Given any small collection of morphisms S
in C, there is a smallest strongly saturated collection containing S: this permits us to deﬁne a localization
S−1 C ⊆ C. The ideas presented in this section go back (at least) to Bousﬁeld; we refer the reader to [12] for
a discussion in a more classical setting.

Deﬁnition 5.5.4.1. Let C be an ∞-category and S a collection of morphisms of C. We say that an object Z
of C is S-local if, for every morphism s : X → Y belonging to S, composition with s induces an isomorphism
MapC(Y, Z) → MapC(X, Z) in the homotopy category H of spaces.

A morphism f : X → Y of C is an S-equivalence if, for every S-local object Z, composition with f induces

a homotopy equivalence MapC(Y, Z) → MapC(X, Z) is an isomorphism in H.

383

The following result provides a dictionary for relating localization functors to classes of morphisms:

Proposition 5.5.4.2. Let C be an ∞-category, and let L : C → C be a localization functor. Let S denote
the collection of all morphisms f in C such that Lf is an equivalence. Then:

(1) An object C of C is S-local if and only if it belongs to L C.

(2) Every S-equivalence in C belongs to S.

(3) Suppose that C is accessible. The following conditions are equivalent:

(i) The ∞-category L C is accessible.
(ii) The functor L : C → C is accessible.
(iii) There exists a (small) subset S0 ⊆ S such that every S0-local object is S-local.

Proof of (1) and (2). By assumption, L is left adjoint to the inclusion L C ⊆ C; let α : idC → L be a unit
map for the adjunction. We begin by proving (1). Suppose that X ∈ L C. Let f : Y → Z belong to S. Then
we have a commutative diagram

MapC(LZ, X)

MapC(LY, X)

MapC(Z, X)

/ MapC(Y, X)

in the homotopy category H, where the vertical maps are given by composition with α and are homotopy
equivalences by assumption. Since Lf is an equivalence, the top horizontal map is also a homotopy equiva-
lence. It follows that the bottom horizontal map is a homotopy equivalence, so that X is S-local. Conversely,
suppose that X is S-local. According to Proposition 5.2.7.4, the map α(X) : X → LX belongs to S, so
that composition with α(X) induces a homotopy equivalence MapC(LX, X) → MapC(X, X). In particular,
there exists a map LX → X whose composition with α(X) is homotopic to idX . Thus X is a retract of LX.
Since α(LX) is an equivalence, we conclude that α(X) is an equivalence, so that X ≃ LX and therefore X
belongs to the essential image of L, as desired. This proves (1).

Suppose that f : X → Y is an S-equivalence. We have a commutative diagram

X

f

Y

α(X)

α(Y )

LX

Lf

/ LY

where the vertical maps are S-equivalences (by Proposition 5.2.7.4), so that Lf is also an S-equivalence.
Therefore LX and LY corepresent the same functor on the homotopy category hL C. Yoneda’s lemma implies
that Lf is an equivalence, so that f ∈ S. This proves (2).

The proof of (3) is somewhat more involved, and will require a few preliminaries.

Lemma 5.5.4.3. Let τ ≫ κ be regular cardinals, and suppose that τ is uncountable. Let A be a κ-ﬁltered
partially ordered set, A′ ⊆ A a τ -small subset, and

{fγ : Xγ → Yγ}γ∈C

a τ -small collection of natural transformations of diagrams in KanA. Suppose that for each α ∈ A, γ ∈ C,
the Kan complexes Xγ(α) and Yγ(α) are essentially τ -small. Suppose further that, for each γ ∈ C, the map
fγ is a homotopy equivalence. Then there exists a τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subset A′′ ⊆ A
of Kan complexes lim
such that A′ ⊆ A′′, and lim
−→A′′ fγ|A′′ is a homotopy equivalence for each γ ∈ C.

Proof. Replacing each fγ by an equivalent transformation if necessary, we may suppose for each γ ∈ C,
α ∈ A, the map fγ(α) is a Kan ﬁbration.

Let α ∈ A, γ ∈ C, and let σ(α, γ) be a diagram

fγ|B is a Kan ﬁbration, which is trivial if
and only if for every diagram σ(α, γ) as above, where α ∈ B, there exists α′ ∈ B such that α′ ≥ α, and
α′ trivializes σ(α, γ). In particular, since lim
fγ is a homotopy equivalence, every such diagram σ(α, γ) is
trivialized by some α′ ≥ α.

We now deﬁne a sequence of τ -small subsets A(λ) ⊆ A, indexed by ordinals λ ≤ κ. Let A(0) = A′, and
λ′<λ A(λ′) when λ is a limit ordinal. Supposing that λ < κ and that A(λ) has been deﬁned, we
let A(λ) =
choose a set of representatives Σ = {σ(α, γ)} for all homotopy classes of diagrams as above, where α ∈ A(λ)
and γ ∈ C. Since the Kan complexes Xγ(α), Yγ(α) are essentially τ -small, we may choose the set Σ to be
τ -small. Each σ ∈ Σ is trivialized by some α′
σ}σ∈Σ. Then B is τ -small. Now choose
a τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subset A(λ + 1) ⊆ A containing A(λ) ∪ B (the existence of A(λ + 1) is guaranteed by
Lemma 5.4.2.10).

σ ∈ A; let B = {α′

S

We now deﬁne A′′ to be A(κ); it is easy to see that A′′ has the desired properties.

Lemma 5.5.4.4. Let τ ≫ κ be regular cardinals, and suppose that τ is uncountable. Let A be a κ-ﬁltered
partially ordered set, and for every subset B ⊆ A, let

lim
−→B

: Fun(N(B), S) → S

denote a left adjoint to the diagonal functor. Let A′ ⊆ A be a τ -small subset and {fγ : Xγ → Yγ}γ∈C a
τ -small collection of morphisms in the ∞-category Fun(N(A), Sτ ) of diagrams N(A) → Sτ . Suppose that
(fγ) is an equivalence, for each γ ∈ C. Then there exists a τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subset A′′ ⊆ A which
lim
−→A
contains A′, such that each of the morphisms lim

−→A′′ (fγ| N(A′′)) is an equivalence in S.

Proof. Using Proposition 4.2.4.4, we may assume without loss of generality that each fγ is the simplicial
nerve of a natural transformation of functors from A to Kan. According to Theorem 4.2.4.1, we can identify
(Yγ| N(B)) with homotopy colimits in Kan. If B is ﬁltered, then these homotopy
lim
−→B
colimits reduce to ordinary colimits (since the class of weak homotopy equivalences in Kan is stable under
ﬁltered colimits), and we may apply Lemma 5.5.4.3.

Proof of part (3) of Proposition 5.5.4.2. If L C is accessible, then Proposition 5.4.7.7 implies that both the
inclusion L C → C and L : C → L C are accessible functors, so that their composition is accessible. Thus
(i) ⇒ (ii). Suppose next that (ii) is satisﬁed. Let α : idC → L denote a unit for the adjunction between
L and the inclusion L C ⊆ C, and let κ be a regular cardinal such that C is κ-accessible and L is κ-
continuous. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that C is minimal, so that Cκ is a small ∞-
category. Let S0 = {α(X) : X ∈ Cκ}, and let Y ∈ C be S0-local. We wish to prove that Y is S-local. Let

FY : C → Sop denote the functor represented by Y . Then α induces a natural transformation FY → FY ◦ L.
The functors FY and FY ◦ L are both κ-continuous, and by assumption α induces an equivalence of functors
FY | Cκ → (FY ◦ L)| Cκ when both sides are restricted to κ-compact objects. Proposition 5.3.5.10 now implies
that FY and FY ◦ L are equivalent, so that Y is S-local. This proves (iii).

We complete the proof by showing that (iii) implies (i). Let κ be a regular cardinal such that C is
κ-accessible and S0 is a set of morphisms between κ-compact objects of C. We claim that L C is stable
under κ-ﬁltered colimits in C. To prove this, let p : K ⊲ → C be a colimit diagram, where K is small and
κ-ﬁltered, and p = p|K factors through L C ⊆ C. Let s : X → Y be a morphism which belongs to S0,
and let s′ : FX → FY be the corresponding map of co-representable functors C →
S. Since X and Y are
S. The map s′ induces
κ-compact by assumption, both pX : FX ◦ p and pY : FY ◦ p are colimit diagrams in
a transformation pX → pY , which is an equivalence when restricted to K, and is therefore an equivalence
b
in general. It follows that MapC(Y, p(∞)) ≃ MapC(X, p(∞)), where ∞ denotes the cone point of K ⊲. Thus
b
p(∞) is S0-local as desired.

Now choose an uncountable regular cardinal τ ≫ κ such that Cκ is essentially τ -small. According to
Proposition 5.4.2.2, to complete the proof that C is accessible it will suﬃce to show that L C is generated by
τ -compact objects under τ -ﬁltered colimits. Let X be an object of L C. Lemma 5.1.5.3 implies that X can
be written as the colimit of a small diagram p : I → Cκ, where I is κ-ﬁltered. Using Proposition 5.3.1.16,
we may suppose that I is the nerve of a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set A. Let B denote the collection of all
κ-ﬁltered, τ -small subsets Aβ ⊆ A for which the colimit of p| N(Aβ) is S0-local. Lemma 5.5.4.4 asserts that
every τ -small subset of A is contained in Aβ, for some β ∈ B. It follows that B is τ -ﬁltered, when regarded
as partially ordered by inclusion, and that A =
β∈B Aβ. Using Proposition 4.2.3.8 and Corollary 4.2.3.10,
we can obtain X as the colimit of a diagram q : N(B) → C, where each q(β) is a colimit Xβ of p| N(Aβ ).
The objects {Xβ}β∈B are S0-local and τ -compact by construction.

S

According to Proposition 5.5.4.2, every localization L of an ∞-category C is determined by the class S of
morphisms f such that Lf is an equivalence. This raises the question: which classes of morphisms S arise
in this way? To answer this question, we will begin by isolating some of the most obvious properties enjoyed
by S.

Deﬁnition 5.5.4.5. Let C be a ∞-category which admits small colimits, and let S be a collection of
morphisms of C. We will say that S is strongly saturated if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) Given a pushout diagram

C

C′

D

/ D′

in C, if f belongs to S, then so does f ′.

(2) The full subcategory of Fun(∆1, C) spanned by S is stable under small colimits.

Remark 5.5.4.6. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits, and let S be a strongly saturated
class of morphisms of C. Let ∅ be an initial object of C. Condition (2) of Deﬁnition 5.5.4.5 implies that
id∅ : ∅ → ∅ belongs to S, since it is an initial object of Fun(∆1, C). Any equivalence in C is a pushout of
id∅, so condition (1) implies that S contains all equivalences in C. It also follows from condition (1) that if
f : C → D belongs to S and f ′ : C → D is homotopic to f , then f ′ belongs to S (since f ′ is a pushout of
f ). Note also that condition (2) implies that S is stable under retracts, since any retract of a morphism f
can be written as a colimit of copies of f (Proposition 4.4.5.12).

Remark 5.5.4.7. Let C be an ∞-category which admits colimits. Given any collection {Sα}α∈A of strongly
saturated classes of morphisms of C, the intersection S =
α∈A Sα is also strongly saturated. It follows that
any collection S0 of morphisms in C is contained in a smallest strongly saturated class of morphisms S. In
this case we will also write S = S0; we refer to it as the strongly saturated class of morphisms generated by
S0. We will say that S is of small generation if S = S0, where S0 ⊆ S is small.

T

Remark 5.5.4.8. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits. Let S be a strongly saturated class
of morphisms of C. If f : X → Y lies in S and K is a simplicial set, then the induced map X ⊗ K → Y ⊗ K
(which is well-deﬁned up to equivalence) lies in S. This follows from the closure of S under colimits. We
will use this observation in the proof of Proposition 5.5.4.15, in the case where K = ∂ ∆n is a (simplicial)
sphere.

Example 5.5.4.9. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits, and let S denote the class of
all equivalences in C. Then S is strongly saturated; it is clearly the smallest strongly saturated class of
morphisms of C.

Remark 5.5.4.10. Let F : C′ → C be a functor between ∞-categories. Suppose that C and C′ admit small
colimits and that F preserves small colimits. Let S be a strongly saturated class of morphisms in C′. Then
F −1S is a strongly saturated class of morphisms of C. In particular, if we let S denote the collection of all
morphisms f of C′ such that F (f ) is an equivalence, then S is strongly saturated.

Lemma 5.5.4.11. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits, let S0 be a class of morphisms in
C, and let S denote the collection of all S-equivalences. Then S is strongly saturated.

Proof. For each object X ∈ C, let FX : C → Sop denote the functor represented by X, and let S(X) denote
the collection of all morphisms f such that FX (f ) is an equivalence. Since FX preserves small colimits,
Remark 5.5.4.10 implies that S(X) is strongly saturated. We now observe that S is the intersection
S(X),
where X ranges over the class of all S0-local objects of C.

T

Lemma 5.5.4.12. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits, let S be a strongly saturated collection
of morphisms of C, and let C ∈ C be an object. Let D ⊆ CC/ be the full subcategory of CC/ spanned by those
objects C → C′ which belong to S. Then D is stable under small colimits in CC/.

Proof. The proofs of Corollary 4.2.3.11 and 4.4.2.4 show that it will suﬃce to prove that D is stable under
ﬁltered colimits, pushouts, and contains the initial objects of CC/. The last condition is equivalent to
the requirement that S contains all equivalences, which follows from Remark 5.5.4.6. Now suppose that
p : K ⊲ → CC/ is a colimit of p = p|K, where K is either ﬁltered or equivalent to Λ2
0, and that p(K) ⊆ D.
We can identify p with a map P : K ⊲ × ∆1 → C such that P |K ⊲ × {0} is the constant map taking the value
C ∈ C. Since K is weakly contractible, P |K ⊲ × {0} is a colimit diagram in C. The map P |K ⊲ × {1} is the
image of a colimit diagram under the left ﬁbration CC/ → C; since K is weakly contractible, Proposition
4.4.2.9 implies that P |K ⊲ × {1} is a colimit diagram. We now apply Proposition 5.1.2.2 to deduce that
P : K ⊲ → C∆1
, we conclude that P carries the
cone point of K ⊲ to a morphism belonging to S, as we wished to show.

determines a vertex v of Y lying over the cone point of N(A0(n))⊲. According to Proposition 3.3.4.5, the
inclusion Y ×N(A0(n))⊲ N(A0(n)) ⊆ Y is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets. It follows that there
exists an edge e : v′ → v of Y which joins v to some vertex v′ lying over an element a ∈ A0(n). We now
deﬁne an = a, and observe that the edge e corresponds to the desired extension qn+1 of qn.

Lemma 5.5.4.14. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, let S be a strongly saturated collection of morphisms
in C, and let D ⊆ Fun(∆1, C) be the full subcategory spanned by S. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The ∞-category D is accessible.

(2) The ∞-category D is presentable.

(3) The collection S is of small generation (as a strongly saturated class of morphisms).

Proof. We observe that D is stable under small colimits in Fun(∆1, C), and therefore admits small colimits;
thus (1) ⇒ (2). To see that (2) implies (3), we choose a small collection S0 of morphisms in C which generates
D under colimits; it is then obvious that S0 generates S as a strongly saturated class of morphisms.

Now suppose that (3) is satisﬁed. Choose a small collection of morphisms {fβ : Xβ → Yβ} which
generates S and an uncountable regular cardinal κ such that C is κ-accessible and each of the objects Xβ,
Yβ is κ-compact. We will prove that D is κ-accessible.

It is clear that D is locally small and admits κ-ﬁltered colimits. Let D′ ⊆ D be the collection of all
morphisms f : X → Y such that f belongs to S, where both X and Y are κ-compact. Lemma 5.3.4.9
implies that each f ∈ D′ is a κ-compact object of Fun(∆1, C), and in particular a κ-compact object of
D. Assume for simplicity that C is a minimal ∞-category, so that D′ is small. According to Proposition
5.3.5.10, the inclusion D′ ⊆ D is equivalent to j ◦ F , where j : D′ → Indκ D′ is the Yoneda embedding and
F : Indκ D′ → D is κ-continuous. Proposition 5.3.5.11 implies that F is fully faithful; let D′′ denote its
essential image. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that D′′ = D. Let S′′ ⊆ S denote the collection
of objects of D′′ (which we may identify with morphisms in C). By construction, S′′ contains the collection
of morphisms {fβ} which generates S. Consequently, to prove that S′′ = S, it will suﬃce to show that S′′
is strongly saturated.

It follows from Proposition 5.5.1.9 that D′′ ⊆ Fun(∆1, C) is stable under small colimits. We next verify

that S′′ is stable under pushouts. Let K = Λ2

0, and let p : K ⊲ → C be a colimit of p = p|K,

such that f belongs to S′′. The proof of Proposition 5.4.4.3 shows that we can write p as a colimit of a

diagram q : N(A) → Fun(Λ2
the corresponding diagram, which we may depict as

For each A′ ⊆ A, we let pA′ denote a colimit of q| N(A′), which we will denote by

Let B denote the collection of κ-small, ﬁltered subsets A′ ⊆ A such that the fA′ belongs to S′′. Since f ∈ S′′,
we conclude that f can be obtained as the colimit of a κ-ﬁltered diagram N(A′) → D′, Applying Lemma
A′∈B A′. Using Proposition 4.2.3.4 and Corollary
5.5.4.13, we deduce that B is κ-ﬁltered, and that A =

where A is a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set. For each α ∈ A, we will denote the corresponding diagram by

Arguing as above, we may assume (possibly after changing A and q) that each fα belongs to S′′. Repeating
the same argument, we may suppose that gα belongs to S′′. Since S has the two-out-of-three property, we
conclude that each hα belongs to S. Since Xα and Zα are κ-compact, we then have hα ∈ S′′. The stability
of D′′ under colimits now implies that h ∈ S′′, as desired.

Proposition 5.5.4.15. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and let S be a (small) collection of morphisms
of C. Let S denote the strongly saturated class of morphisms generated by S. Let C′ ⊆ C denote the full
subcategory of C consisting of S-local objects. Then:

(1) For each object C ∈ C, there exists a morphism s : C → C′ such that C′ is S-local and s belongs to S.

(2) The ∞-category C′ is presentable.

(3) The inclusion C′ ⊆ C has a left adjoint L.

(4) For every morphism f of C, the following are equivalent:

(i) The morphism f is an S-equivalence.

(ii) The morphism f belongs to S.

(iii) The induced morphism Lf is an equivalence.

Proof. Assertion (1) is a consequence of Lemma 5.5.5.14, which we will prove in §5.5.5. The equivalence
(1) ⇔ (3) follows immediately from Proposition 5.2.7.8. We now prove (4). Lemma 5.5.4.11 implies that the
collection of S-equivalences is a strongly saturated class of morphisms containing S; it therefore contains S,
so that (ii) ⇒ (i). Now suppose that f : X → Y is such that Lf is an equivalence, and consider the diagram

Our proof of (1) shows that the vertical morphisms belong to S, and the lower horizontal arrow belongs
to S by Remark 5.5.4.6. Two applications of the two-out-of-three property now show that f ∈ S, so that
(iii) ⇒ (ii). If f is an S-equivalence, then we may again use the above diagram and the two-out-of-three
property to conclude that Lf is an equivalence. It follows that LX and LY co-represent the same functor

on the homotopy category h C′, so that Yoneda’s lemma implies that Lf is an equivalence. Thus (i) ⇒ (iii)
and the proof of (4) is complete.

It remains to prove (2). Remark 5.2.7.5 implies that L C admits small colimits, so it will suﬃce to prove
that L C is accessible. According to Proposition 5.5.4.2, this follows from the implication (iii) ⇒ (i) of
assertion (4).

Proposition 5.5.4.15 gives a clear picture of the collection of all accessible localizations of a presentable
∞-category C. For any (small) set of morphisms S in C, the full subcategory S−1 C ⊆ C consisting of S-local
objects is a localization of C, and every localization arises in this way. Moreover, the subcategories S−1 C
and T −1 C coincide if and only if S and T generate the same strongly saturated class of morphisms. We
will also write S−1 C for the class of S-local objects of C in the case where S is not small; however, this is
generally only a well-behaved object in the case where there is a (small) subset S0 ⊆ S which generates the
same strongly saturated class of morphisms.

Proposition 5.5.4.16. Let f : C → D be a presentable functor between presentable ∞-categories, let S be
strongly saturated class of morphisms of D which is of small generation. Then f −1S is of small generation
(as a strongly saturated class of morphisms of C).

Proof. Replacing D by S−1 D if necessary, we may suppose that S consists of precisely the equivalences in
D. Let ED ⊆ Fun(∆1, D) denote the full subcategory spanned by those morphisms which are equivalences
in D, and let EC ⊆ Fun(∆1, C) denote the full subcategory spanned by those morphisms which belong to
f −1S. We have a homotopy Cartesian diagram of ∞-categories

EC

ED

Fun(∆1, C)

/ Fun(∆1, D).

The ∞-category ED is equivalent to D, and therefore presentable. The ∞-categories Fun(∆1, C) and
Fun(∆1, D) are presentable by Proposition 5.5.3.6.
It follows from Proposition 5.5.3.12 that EC is pre-
sentable. In particular, there is a small collection of objects of EC which generates EC under colimits, as
desired.

Let C be a presentable ∞-category. We will say that a full subcategory C0 ⊆ C is strongly reﬂective if
it is the essential image of an accessible localization functor. Equivalently, C0 is strongly reﬂective if it is
presentable, stable under equivalence in C, and the inclusion C0 ⊆ C admits a left adjoint. According to
Proposition 5.5.4.15, C0 is strongly reﬂective if and only if there exists a (small) set S of morphisms of C
such that C0 is the full subcategory of C spanned by the S-local objects. For later use, we record a few easy
stability properties enjoyed by the collection of strongly reﬂective subcategories of C:

Lemma 5.5.4.17. Let f : C → D be a presentable functor between presentable ∞-categories, and let C0 ⊆ C
be a strongly reﬂective subcategory. Let f ∗ denote a right adjoint of f , and let D0 ⊆ D be the full subcategory
spanned by those objects D ∈ D such that f ∗D ∈ C0. Then D0 is a strongly reﬂective subcategory of D.

Proof. Let S be a (small) set of morphisms of C such that C0 is the full subcategory of C spanned by the
S-local objects. Then D0 is the full subcategory of D spanned by the f (S)-local objects.

Lemma 5.5.4.18. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and let {Cα}α∈A be a family of full subcategories of C
α∈A Cα is strongly reﬂective.
indexed by a (small) set A. Suppose that each Cα is strongly reﬂective. Then
Proof. For each α ∈ A, choose a (small) set S(α) of morphisms of C such that Cα is the full subcategory of C

Lemma 5.5.4.19. Let C be a presentable ∞-category and K a small simplicial set. Let D denote the full
subcategory of Fun(K ⊳, C) spanned by those diagrams p : K ⊳ → C which are limits of p = p|K. Then D is a
strongly reﬂective subcategory of C.

Proof. The restriction functor D → Fun(K, C) is an equivalence of ∞-categories. This proves that D is
accessible. Let s : Fun(K, C) → D be a homotopy inverse to the restriction map. Then the composition

is left adjoint to the inclusion.

Fun(K ⊲, C) → Fun(K, C) s→ D

We conclude this section by giving a universal property which characterizes the localization S−1 C.

Proposition 5.5.4.20. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and D an arbitrary ∞-category. Let S be a
(small) set of morphisms of C, and L : C → S−1 C ⊆ C an associated (accessible) localization functor.
Composition with L induces a functor

η : FunL(S−1 C, D) → FunL(C, D).

The functor η is fully faithful, and the essential image of η consists of those functors f : C → D such that
f (s) is an equivalence in D, for each s ∈ S.

Proof. Let α : idC → L be a unit for the adjunction between L and the inclusion S−1 C ⊆ C. We ﬁrst observe
that every functor f0 : S−1 C → D admits a right Kan extension f : C → D. To prove this, we may ﬁrst
replace f0 by the equivalent diagram g0 = f0 ◦ (L|S−1 C), and deﬁne g = f0 ◦ L. To prove that g is a right
Kan extension of g0, it suﬃces to show that for each object X ∈ C, the diagram

p : (S−1 C)⊳

X/ → C L→ S−1 C f0→ D

exhibits f0(LX) as a limit of p = p|(S−1 C)/X ). For this, we note that an S-localization map α(X) : X → LX
is an initial object of (S−1 C)X/ (Remark 5.2.7.7), and that f0(Lα(X)) is an equivalence by Proposition
5.2.7.4.

Let X denote the full subcategory of DC spanned by those functors f : C → D which are right Kan
extensions of f |S−1 C. According to Proposition 4.3.2.15, the restriction map X → Fun(S−1 C, D) is a trivial
ﬁbration. Let η : Fun(S−1 C, D) → Fun(C, D) be given by composition with L. The above argument shows
that η factors through X. Moreover, the composition of η with the restriction map is homotopic to the
identity on Fun(S−1 C, D). It follows that η is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

We have a commutative diagram

FunL(S−1 C, D)

Fun(S−1 C, D)

η

η

FunL(C, D)

/ Fun(C, D)

where the vertical maps are inclusions of full subcategories, and the lower horizontal map is fully faithful.
It follows that η is fully faithful. To complete the proof, we must show that a functor f : C → D belongs to
the essential image of η if and only if f (s) is an equivalence for each s ∈ S. The “only if” direction is clear,
since the functor L carries each element of S to an equivalence in C. Conversely, suppose that f carries each
s ∈ S to an equivalence. The natural transformation α gives a map of functors α(f ) : f → f ◦ L; we wish
to show that α(f ) is an equivalence. Equivalently, we wish to show that for each object X ∈ C, f carries
the map α(X) : X → LX to an equivalence in D. Let S′ denote the class of all morphisms φ in C such that
f (φ) is an equivalence in D. By assumption, S ⊆ S′. Lemma 5.5.4.11 implies that S′ is strongly saturated,
so that Proposition 5.5.4.15 asserts that α(X) ∈ S′, as desired.

5.5.5 Factorization Systems on Presentable ∞-Categories

Let C be a presentable ∞-category. In §5.5.4, we saw that it is easy to produce localizations of C: for any
small collection of morphisms S in C, the full subcategory S−1 C of S-local objects of C is a presentable
localization of C, which depends only on the strongly saturated class of morphisms S generated by S. Our
goal in this section is to prove a similar result for factorization systems on C. The ﬁrst step is to introduce
the analogue of the notion of “strongly saturated”:

Deﬁnition 5.5.5.1. Let S be a collection of morphisms in a presentable ∞-category C. We will say that S
is saturated if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The collection S is closed under small colimits in Fun(∆1, C).

(2) The collection S contains all equivalences and is stable under composition.

(3) The collection S is closed under the formation of pushouts. That is, given a pushout diagram

X

f

Y

X ′

f ′

/ Y ′

in C, if f belongs to S then f ′ also belongs to S.

Remark 5.5.5.2. Let C be a presentable ∞-category. Then any intersection of saturated collections of
morphisms in C is again saturated. It follows that for any class of morphisms S of C, there exists a smallest
saturated collection of morphisms S containing S. We will refer to S as the saturated collection of morphisms
generated by S. We will say that a saturated collection of morphisms S is of small generation if it is generated
by some (small) subset S ⊆ S.

Remark 5.5.5.3. If S is a saturated collection of morphisms of C, then S is closed under retracts.

Remark 5.5.5.4. Let C be (the nerve of) a presentable category, and let S be a saturated class of morphisms
in C. Then S is also weakly saturated, in the sense of Deﬁnition A.1.2.2.

Example 5.5.5.5. Let C be a presentable ∞-category. Then every strongly saturated class of morphisms
in C is also saturated.

Example 5.5.5.6. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and S any collection of morphisms of C. Then ⊥S
is saturated; this follows immediately from Proposition 5.2.8.6. In particular, if (SL, SR) is a factorization
system on C, then SL is saturated.

The main result of this section is the following converse to Example 5.5.5.6:

Proposition 5.5.5.7. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and S a saturated collection of morphisms in C
which is of small generation. Then (S, S⊥) is a factorization system on C.

Corollary 5.5.5.8. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, let S be a saturated collection of morphisms of C,
and suppose that S is of small generation. Let

Proof. Combine Propositions 5.5.5.7, 5.2.8.11, and 5.2.8.6.

In the situation of Proposition 5.5.5.7, we will refer to the elements of S⊥ as S-local morphisms of C.
Note that an object X ∈ C is S-local if and only if a morphism X → 1C is S-local, where 1C denotes a ﬁnal
object of C.

The proof of Proposition 5.5.5.7 will be given at the end of this section, after we have established a series

of technical lemmas.

Lemma 5.5.5.9. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and S a saturated collection of morphisms of C. The
following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The collection S is of small generation.

(2) The full subcategory D ⊆ Fun(∆1, C) spanned by the elements of S is presentable.

Proof. If D is presentable, then D is generated under small colimits by a small set of objects; these objects
clearly generate S as a saturated collection of morphisms. This proves that (2) ⇒ (1). To prove the reverse
implication, choose a small collection of morphisms {fβ : Xβ → Yβ} which generates S as a semiaturated
class of morphisms and an uncountable regular cardinal κ such that C is κ-accessible and each of the objects
Xβ, Yβ is κ-compact. Let D′ ⊆ D be the collection of all morphisms f : X → Y such that f belongs to
S, where both X and Y are κ-compact. Lemma 5.3.4.9 implies that each f ∈ D′ is a κ-compact object
of Fun(∆1, C), and in particular a κ-compact object of D. Assume for simplicity that C is a minimal ∞-
category, so that D′ is small. According to Proposition 5.3.5.10, the inclusion D′ ⊆ D is equivalent to j ◦ F ,
where j : D′ → Indκ D′ is the Yoneda embedding and F : Indκ D′ → D is κ-continuous. Proposition 5.3.5.11
implies that F is fully faithful; let D′′ denote its essential image. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to
show that D′′ = D.

Let S′ ⊆ S denote the collection of objects of D′′ (which we may identify with morphisms in C). By
construction, S′ contains the collection of morphisms {fβ} which generates S. Consequently, to prove that
S′ = S, it will suﬃce to show that S′ is saturated.

It follows from Proposition 5.5.1.9 that D′′ ⊆ Fun(∆1, C) is stable under small colimits. We next verify

that S′ is stable under pushouts. Let K = Λ2

0, and let p : K ⊲ → C be a colimit of p = p|K,

such that f belongs to S′. Using Proposition 5.3.5.15, we can write p as the colimit of a diagram q : N(A) →
0, Cκ), where A is a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set. For α ∈ A, we let pα denote the corresponding
Fun(Λ2
diagram, which we may depict as

For each A′ ⊆ A, we let pA′ denote a colimit of q| N(A′), which we will denote by

fA′→ YA′ .

Let B denote the collection of κ-small, ﬁltered subsets A′ ⊆ A such that the fA′ belongs to S′. Since f ∈ S′,
we conclude that f can be obtained as the colimit of a κ-ﬁltered diagram in D′, Applying Lemma 5.5.4.13,
A′∈B A′. Using Proposition 4.2.3.4 and Corollary 4.2.3.10,
we deduce that B is κ-ﬁltered, and that A =
0, C), where q′(A′) = pA′ . Replacing A by
we deduce that p is the colimit of a diagram q′ : N(B) → Fun(Λ2

that each hα belongs to S. Since each Xα and Zα are κ-compact, we have hα ∈ S′. The stability of D′′
under colimits now implies that h ∈ S′, as desired.

Lemma 5.5.5.10. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and let S be a saturated collection of morphisms in
C. For every object X ∈ C, let SX denote the collection of all morphisms of C/X whose image in C belongs
to S. Then each SX is strongly saturated in C/X . Moreover, if S is of small generation, then each SX is
also of small generation.

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows immediately from the deﬁnitions and Proposition 1.2.13.8. To prove the
second, let D be the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, C) spanned by the elements of S, and D′ the full subcategory
of Fun(∆1, C/X ) spanned by the elements of SX . We have a (homotopy) pullback diagram of ∞-categories

D′

/ Fun(∆1, C).

The functors φ and ψ preserve small colimits, and the ∞-categories Fun(∆1, C/X ), Fun(∆1, C), and D are all
presentable (the last in view of Lemma 5.5.5.9). Using Proposition 5.5.3.12, we deduce that D′ is presentable,
and therefore generated under small colimits by a (small) set of elements of SX . This proves that SX is of
small generation, as desired.

Lemma 5.5.5.11. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, S a saturated collection of morphisms of C, and X
an object of C. Then the full subcategory D ⊆ CX/ spanned by the elements which belong to S is closed under
small colimits.

Proof. In view of Corollary 4.2.3.11 and 4.4.2.4, it will suﬃce to show that D is closed under small ﬁltered
colimits, pushouts, and contains the initial objects of CX/. The last condition follows from the fact that
S contains all equivalences. Now suppose that p : K ⊲ → CC/ is a colimit of p = p|K, where K is either
0, and that p(K) ⊆ D. We can identify p with a map P : K ⊲ × ∆1 → C such
ﬁltered or equivalent to Λ2
that P |K ⊲ × {0} is the constant map taking the value C ∈ C. Since K is weakly contractible, P |K ⊲ × {0}
is a colimit diagram in C. The map P |K ⊲ × {1} is the image of a colimit diagram under the left ﬁbration
CC/ → C; since K is weakly contractible, Proposition 4.4.2.9 implies that P |K ⊲ × {1} is a colimit diagram.
We now apply Proposition 5.1.2.2 to deduce that P : K ⊲ → C∆1
is a colimit diagram. Since S is stable
under colimits in C∆1
, we conclude that P carries the cone point of K ⊲ to a morphism belonging to S, as
we wished to show.

Lemma 5.5.5.12. Let C be an ∞-category, and let f : C → D, g : C → E be morphisms in C. Then there
is a natural identiﬁcation of MapCC/ (f, g) with the homotopy ﬁber of the map

MapC(D, E) → MapC(C, E)

induced by composition with f , where the ﬁber is taken over the point corresponding to g.

Proof. We have a commutative diagram of simplicial sets

where both squares are pullbacks. Proposition 2.1.2.1 asserts that φ′′ is a left ﬁbration, so that φ′ and φ
are left ﬁbrations as well. Since CC/ ×C{E} = HomL
C(C, E) is a Kan complex, the map φ′ is actually a Kan
ﬁbration (Lemma 2.1.3.3), so that the square on the left is homotopy pullback, and identiﬁes

with the homotopy ﬁber of φ′ over g; we conclude by observing that φ′ is a model for the map

Cf / ×CC/ {g} ≃ MapCC/ (f, g)

with MapCY / (f ′, idY ) and MapCX/ (f, g), respectively.

Lemma 5.5.5.14. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and let S be a saturated collection of morphisms of C
which is of small generation. Then, for every object X ∈ C, there exists a morphism f : X → Y in C, such
that f ∈ S and Y is S-local.

Proof. Let D be the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, C) spanned by the elements of S, and form a ﬁber diagram

DX

Since S is stable under pushouts, the right vertical map is a coCartesian ﬁbration, so that the above diagram
is homotopy Cartesian by Proposition 3.3.1.3. Lemma 5.5.5.9 asserts that D is accessible, so that DX is
accessible by Proposition 5.4.6.6. Using Lemma 5.5.5.11, we conclude that DX is presentable, so that DX
has a ﬁnal object f : X → Y . To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that Y is S-local.

Let t : A → B be an arbitrary morphism in C which belongs to S. We wish to show that composition
with t induces a homotopy equivalence φ : MapC(B, Y ) → MapC(A, Y ). Let g : A → Y be an arbitrary

then follows from Lemma 5.5.5.14.

5.5.6 Truncated Objects

Let X be a topological space. The ﬁrst step in the homotopy-theoretic analysis of the space X is to divide
X into path components. The situation can be described as follows: we associate to X a set π0X, which
we may view as a discrete topological space. There is a map f : X → π0X which collapses each component
of X to a point. If X is a suﬃciently nice space (for example, a CW complex), then the path components
of X are open, so f is continuous. Moreover, f is universal among continuous maps from X into a discrete
topological space.

The next step in the analysis of X is to consider its fundamental group π1X, which (provided that X is
X of X. However, it is important to realize
suﬃciently nice) may be studied by means of a universal cover
that neither π1X nor
X is invariantly associated to X: both require a choice of base point. The situation can
e
be described more canonically as follows: to X we can associate a fundamental groupoid π(X), and a map
φ from X to the classifying space Bπ(X). The universal cover
X of X can be identiﬁed (up to homotopy
equivalence) with the homotopy ﬁbers of the map φ. The classifying space Bπ(X) can be regarded as a
“quotient” of X, obtained by killing all of the higher homotopy groups of X. Like π0X, it can be described
by a universal mapping property.

e

e

To continue the analysis, we ﬁrst recall that a space Y is said to be k-truncated if the homotopy groups
of Y vanish in dimensions larger than k (see Deﬁnition 2.3.4.15). Every (suﬃciently nice) topological space
X admits an essentially unique Postnikov tower

X → . . . → τ≤nX → . . . → τ≤−1X

where τ≤iX is i-truncated, and is universal (in a suitable homotopy-theoretic sense) among i-truncated
spaces which admit a map from X. For example, we can take τ≤0X = π0X, considered as a discrete space,
and τ≤1X = Bπ(X). Moreover, we can recover the space X (up to weak homotopy equivalence) by taking
the homotopy limit of the tower.

The objective of this section is to construct an analogous theory in the case where X is not a space, but
an object of some (abstract) ∞-category C. We begin by observing that the condition that a space X is
k-truncated can be reformulated in more categorical terms: a Kan complex X is k-truncated if and only if,
for every simplicial set S, the mapping space MapSet∆(S, X) is k-truncated. This motivates the following:

Deﬁnition 5.5.6.1. Let C be an ∞-category and k ≥ −1 an integer. We will say that an object C of C is
k-truncated if, for every object D ∈ C, the space MapC(D, C) is k-truncated. By convention, we will say that
C is (−2)-truncated if it is a ﬁnal object of C. We will say that an object of C is discrete if it is 0-truncated.
We will generally let τ≤k C denote the full subcategory of C spanned by the k-truncated objects.

Notation 5.5.6.2. Let C be an ∞-category. Using Propositions 2.3.4.18 and 2.3.4.5, we conclude that the
full subcategory τ≤0 C is equivalent to the nerve of its homotopy category. We will denote this homotopy
category by Disc(C), and refer to it as the category of discrete objects of C.

Lemma 5.5.6.3. Let C be an object of an ∞-category C, and let k ≥ −2. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The object C is k-truncated.

(2) For every n ≥ k + 3 and every diagram

/ C
=z

f

z

z

∂ ∆n(cid:127)

for which f carries the ﬁnal vertex of ∆n to C, there exists a dotted arrow rendering the diagram
commutative.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (2) is satisﬁed. Then for every object D ∈ D, the Kan complex HomR
C (D, C) and
every n ≥ k + 3 has the extension property with respect to ∂ ∆n−1 ⊆ ∆n−1, and is therefore k-truncated.
For the converse, suppose that (1) is satisﬁed and choose a categorical equivalence g : C → N D, where D is
a topological category. According to Proposition A.2.3.1, it will suﬃce to show that for every n ≥ k + 3 and
every diagram

/ D

| C[∆n]|

having the property that F carries the ﬁnal object of | C[∆n]| to g(C), there exists a dotted arrow as indicated,
rendering the diagram commutative. Let D ∈ D denote the image of the initial object of ∂ ∆n under F .
Then constructing the desired extension is equivalent to extending a map ∂[0, 1]n−1 → MapD(D, g(C)) to a
map deﬁned on all of [0, 1]n−1, which is possibly in virtue of the assumption (1).

Remark 5.5.6.4. A Kan complex X is k-truncated if and only if it is k-truncated when regarded as an
object in the ∞-category S of spaces.

Proposition 5.5.6.5. Let C be an ∞-category, and k ≥ −2 an integer. The full subcategory τ≤k C ⊆ C of
k-truncated objects is stable under all limits which exist in C.

Proof. Let j : C → P(C) be the Yoneda embedding. By deﬁnition, τ≤k C is the preimage of Fun(Cop, τ≤k S)
under j. Since j preserves all limits which exist in C, it will suﬃce to prove that Fun(Cop, τ≤k S) ⊆ Fun(Cop, S)
is stable under limits. Using Proposition 5.1.2.2, it suﬃces to prove that the inclusion i : τ≤k S ⊆ S is
In other words, we must show that τ≤k S admits small limits, and that i preserves
stable under limits.
small limits. According to Propositions 4.4.2.6 and 4.4.2.7, it will suﬃce to show that τ≤k S ⊆ S is stable
under the formation of pullbacks and small products. According to Theorem 4.2.4.1, this is equivalent to
the assertion that the full subcategory of Kan spanned by the k-truncated Kan complexes is stable under
homotopy products and the formation of homotopy pullback squares. Both assertions can be veriﬁed easily
by computing homotopy groups.

Remark 5.5.6.6. Let p : C → D be a coCartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories. Let C and C′ be objects
of C, let f : p(C′) → p(C) be a morphism in C, and let f : C′ → C′′ be a p-coCartesian morphism
(C′′, C) with the homotopy ﬁber of
lifting f . According to Proposition 2.4.4.2, we may identify MapCp(C)
MapC(C′, C) → MapD(p(C′), p(C)) over the base point determined by f . By examining the associated long
exact sequences of homotopy groups (as f varies), we conclude that if C is a k-truncated object of the ﬁber
Cp(C) and p(C) is a k-truncated object of D, then C is a k-truncated object of C. This can be considered as
a generalization of Lemma 2.4.4.7 (which treats the case k = −2).

Remark 5.5.6.7. Let p : M → ∆1 be a coCartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, which we regard as a
correspondence from the ∞-category C = p−1{0} to D = p−1{1}. Suppose that D is a k-truncated object
of D. Remark 5.5.6.6 implies that D is a k-truncated object of M. Let C, C′ ∈ C, and let f : C → D be
a p-Cartesian morphism of M. Then composition with f induces a homotopy equivalence MapC(C′, C) →
MapM(C′, D); we conclude that C is a k-truncated object of M.

Deﬁnition 5.5.6.8. We will say that a map f : X → Y of Kan complexes is k-truncated if the homotopy
ﬁbers of f (taken over any base point of Y ) are k-truncated. We will say that a morphism f : C → D in
an arbitrary ∞-category C is k-truncated if composition with f induces a k-truncated map MapC(E, C) →
MapC(E, D) for every object E ∈ C.

Remark 5.5.6.9. There is an apparent potential for ambiguity in Deﬁnition 5.5.6.8 in the case where C is
an ∞-category whose objects are Kan complexes. However, there is no cause for concern: a map f : X → Y
of Kan complexes is k-truncated if and only if it is k-truncated as a morphism in the ∞-category S.

Remark 5.5.6.10. Let f : C → D and g : E → D be morphisms in an ∞-category C, and let φ :
MapC(E, C) → MapC(E, D) be the map (in the homotopy category H) given by compostion with f . Lemma
5.5.5.12 implies that the homotopy ﬁber of φ over g is homotopy equivalent to MapC/D
(f, g). Consequently,
we deduce that f : C → D is k-truncated in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.5.6.8 if and only if it is k-truncated
when viewed as an object of the ∞-category D/D.

Lemma 5.5.6.11. Let p : C → D be a right ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let f : X → Y be a morphism in
C. Then f is n-truncated if and only if p(f ) : p(X) → p(Y ) is n-truncated.

Proof. The map C/Y → D/p(Y ) is a trivial ﬁbration, and therefore an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Remark 5.5.6.12. A morphism f : C → D in an ∞-category C is k-truncated if and only if it is k-truncated
when regarded as an object of the ∞-category C/D (since the natural map C/D → C/D is an equivalence
of ∞-categories). We may identify C/D with p−1{D}, where p denotes the evaluation map C∆1
→ C{1}.
Corollary 2.4.7.12 implies that p is a coCartesian ﬁbration. Consequently, Remark 5.5.6.7 translates into the
following assertion: if

C′

C

f ′

f

D′

is a pullback diagram in C, and f is k-truncated, then f ′ is k-truncated.

Example 5.5.6.13. A morphism f : C → D in an ∞-category C is (−2)-truncated if and only if it is an
equivalence.

We will say that a morphism f : C → D is a monomorphism if it is (−1)-truncated; this is equivalent to

the assertion that the functor C/f → C/D is fully faithful.

Lemma 5.5.6.14. Let C be an ∞-category and f : X → Y a morphism in C. Suppose that Y is n-truncated.
Then X is n-truncated if and only if f is n-truncated.

Proof. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we reduce immediately to the following statement in classical homotopy
theory: given a map f : X → Y of Kan complexes, where Y is n-truncated, X is n-truncated if and only
if the homotopy ﬁbers of f are n-truncated. This can be established easily, by examining the long exact
sequence of homotopy groups associated to f .

The following lemma gives a recursive characterization of the class of n-truncated morphisms:

Lemma 5.5.6.15. Let C be an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits and let k ≥ −1 be an integer. A
morphism f : C → C′ is k-truncated if and only if the diagonal δ : C → C ×C ′ C (which is well-deﬁned up
to homotopy) is (k − 1)-truncated.

Proof. For each object D ∈ C, let FD : C → S denote the functor co-represented by D. Then each FD
preserves ﬁnite limits, and a morphism f in C is k-truncated if and only if each FD(f ) is a k-truncated
morphism in S. We may therefore reduceo to the case where C = S. Without loss of generality, we may
suppose that f : C → C′ is a Kan ﬁbration. Then Theorem 4.2.4.1 allows us to identify the ﬁber product
C ×C ′ C in S with the same ﬁber product, formed in the ordinary category Kan. We now reduce to the
following assertion in classical homotopy theory (applied to the ﬁbers of f ): if X is a Kan complex, then X
is k-truncated if and only if the homotopy ﬁbers of the diagonal map X → X × X are (k − 1)-truncated.
This can be proven readily by examining homotopy groups.

We immediately deduce the following:

Proposition 5.5.6.16. Let F : C → C′ be a left-exact functor between ∞-categories which admit ﬁnite limits.
Then F carries k-truncated objects into k-truncated objects and k-truncated morphisms into k-truncated
morphisms.

Proof. An object C is k-truncated if and only if the morphism C → 1 to the ﬁnal object is k-truncated.
Since F preserves ﬁnal object, it suﬃces to prove the assertion concerning morphisms. Since F commutes
with ﬁber products, Lemma 5.5.6.15 allows us to use induction on k, thereby reducing to the case where
k = −2. But the (−2)-truncated morphisms are precisely the equivalences, and these are preserved by any
functor.

We now specialize to the case of a presentable ∞-category C. In this setting, we can construct an analogue

of the Postnikov tower.

Lemma 5.5.6.17. Let X be a Kan complex, and let k ≥ −2. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The Kan complex X is k-truncated.

(2) The diagonal map δ : X → X ∂ ∆k+2

is a homotopy equivalence.

Proof. If k = −2, then X ∂ ∆k+2
is a point and the assertion is obvious. Assuming k > −2, we can choose
a vertex v of ∂ ∆k+2, which gives rise to an evaluation map e : X ∂ ∆k+2
→ X. Since e ◦ δ = idX , (2) is
equivalent to the assertion that e is a homotopy equivalence. We observe that e is a Kan ﬁbration. For each
x, let Yx = X ∂ ∆k+2
×X {x} denote the ﬁber of e over the vertex x. Then Yx has a canonical base point,
given by the constant map δ(x). Moreover, we have a natural isomorphism

πi(Yx, δ(x)) ≃ πi+k+1(X, x).

Condition (1) is equivalent to the assertion that πi+k+1(X, x) vanishes for all i ≥ 0 and all x ∈ X. In view
of the above isomorphism, this is equivalent to the assertion that each Yx is contractible, which is true if and
only if the Kan ﬁbration e is trivial.

Proposition 5.5.6.18. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, k ≥ −2. Let τ≤k C denote the full subcategory of
C spanned by the k-truncated objects. Then the inclusion τ≤k C ⊆ C has an accessible left adjoint, which we
will denote by τ≤k.

401

Proof. Let f : ∂ ∆k+2 → Fun(C, C) denote the constant diagram taking the value idC. Let f : (∂ ∆k+2)⊲ →
Fun(C, C) be a colimit of f , and let F : C → C be the image of the cone point under f . Informally, F is given
by the formula

C 7→ C ⊗ Sk+1,

where Sk+1 denotes the (k + 1)-sphere and we regard C as tensored over spaces (see Remark 5.5.1.7).

′

Let f

: (∂ ∆k+2)⊲ → CC be the constant diagram taking the value idC. It follows that there exists an
essentially unique map f → f ′ in (CC)f /, which induces a natural transformation of functors α : F → idC.
Let S = {α(C) : C ∈ C}. Since F is a colimit of functors which preserve small colimits, F itself preserves
small colimits (Lemma 5.5.2.3). Applying Proposition 5.1.2.2, we conclude that α : C → Fun(∆1, C) also
preserves small colimits. Consequently, there exists a small subset S0 ⊆ S which generates S under colimits
in Fun(∆1, C). According to Proposition 5.5.4.15, the collection of S-local objects of C is an accessible
localization of C. It therefore suﬃces to prove that an object X ∈ C is S-local if and only if X is k-truncated.
According to Proposition 5.1.2.2, for each C ∈ C we may identify F (C) with the colimit of the constant

diagram ∂ ∆k+2 → C taking the value C. Corollary 4.4.4.9 implies that we have a homotopy equivalence

The map α(C) induces a map

MapC(F (C), X) ≃ MapC(C, X)∂ ∆k+2

.

α(C)X : MapC(C, X) → MapC(C, X)∂ ∆k+2

which can be identiﬁed with the inclusion of MapC(C, X) as the space of constant maps from ∂ ∆k+2 into
MapC(C, X). According to Lemma 5.5.6.17, the map α(C)X is an equivalence if and only if MapC(C, X) is
k-truncated. Thus X is k-truncated if and only if X is S-local.

Remark 5.5.6.19. The notation of Proposition 5.5.6.18 is self-consistent, in the sense that the existence
of the localization functor τ≤k implies that the collection of k-truncated objects of C may be identiﬁed with
the essential image of τ≤k.

Remark 5.5.6.20. If the ∞-category C is potentially unclear in context, then we will write τ C
truncation functor in C. Note also that τ C
ambiguity).

≤k for the
≤k is well-deﬁned up to equivalence (in fact, up to a contractible

Remark 5.5.6.21. It follows from Proposition 5.5.6.18 that if C is a presentable ∞-category, then the full
subcategory τ≤k C of k-truncated objects is also presentable. In particular, the ordinary category Disc(C) of
discrete objects of C is a presentable category in the sense of Deﬁnition A.1.1.2.

Recall that, if C and D are ∞-categories, then FunL(C, D) denotes the full subcategory of Fun(C, D)
spanned by those functors which are left adjoints. The following result gives a characterization of τ≤n C by
a universal mapping property:

Corollary 5.5.6.22. Let C and D be presentable ∞-categories. Suppose that D is equivalent to an (n + 1)-
category. Then composition with τ≤n induces an equivalence s : FunL(τ≤n C, D) → FunL(C, D).

Proof. According to Proposition 5.5.4.20, the functor s is fully faithful. A functor f : C → D belongs to
the essential image of s if and only if f has a right adjoint g which factors through τ≤n C. Since g preserves
limits, it automatically carries D = τ≤n D into τ≤n C (Proposition 5.5.6.16).

In classical homotopy theory, every space X can be recovered (up to weak homotopy equivalence) as
the homotopy inverse limit of its Postnikov tower {τ≤nX}n≥0. The analogous statement is not true in an
arbitrary presentable ∞-category, but often holds in speciﬁc examples. We now make a general study of this
phenomenon.

A Postnikov tower is a tower with the property that for each n ≥ 0, the map X∞ → Xn exhibits Xn as an
n-truncation of X∞. We deﬁne a pretower to be a functor from N(Z≥0)op → C. A Postnikov pretower is a
pretower

≥0)op, C) spanned by the Postnikov towers, and Post(C) the full subcategory of Fun(N(Z≥0)op, C)
Fun(N(Z∞
spanned by the Postnikov pretowers. We have an evident forgetful functor φ : Post+(C) → Post(C). We will
say that Postnikov towers in C are convergent if φ is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Remark 5.5.6.24. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and let E denote the full subcategory of C × N(Z∞
≥0)op
spanned by those pairs (C, n) where C ∈ C is n-truncated (by convention, we agree that this condition is
always satisﬁed where C = ∞). Then we have a coCartesian ﬁbration p : E → N(Z∞
≥0)op, which classiﬁes a
tower of ∞-categories

C → . . . → τ≤2 C

τ≤1→ τ≤1 C

τ≤0→ τ≤0 C .

We can identify Postnikov towers with coCartesian sections of p (and Postnikov pretowers with coCartesian
≥0)op N(Z≥0)op → N(Z≥0)op). According to Proposition 3.3.3.1,
sections of the induced ﬁbration E ×N(Z∞
Postnikov towers in C converge if and only if the tower above exhibits C as the homotopy limit of the
sequence of ∞-categories

. . . → τ≤2 C → τ≤1 C → τ≤0 C .

Remark 5.5.6.25. Let C be a presentable ∞-category, and assume that Postnikov towers in C are conver-
gent. Then every Postnikov tower in C is a limit diagram. Indeed, given objects X, Y ∈ C, we have natural
homotopy equivalences

MapC(X, Y ) ≃ holim MapC(τ≤nX, τ≤nY ) ≃ holim MapC(X, τ≤nY )

so that Y is the limit of the pretower {τ≤nY }.

Proposition 5.5.6.26. Let C be a presentable ∞-category. Then Postnikov towers in C are convergent if
and only if, for every tower X : N(Z∞

≥0)op → C, the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The diagram X is a Postnikov tower.

(2) The diagram X is a limit in C, and the restriction X| N(Z≥0)op is a Postnikov pretower.

Proof. Let Post′(C) be the full subcategory of Fun(N(Z∞
≥0)op, C) spanned by those towers which satisfy
condition (2). Using Proposition 4.3.2.15, we deduce that the restriction functor Post′(C) → Post(C) is a
trivial Kan ﬁbration. If conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent, then Post′(C) = Post+(C), so that Postnikov
towers in C are convergent. Conversely, suppose that Postnikov towers in C are convergent. Using Remark
5.5.6.25, we deduce that Post+(C) ⊆ Post′(C), so we have a commutative diagram

Post+(C)

Post(C).

Since both of the vertical arrows are trivial Kan ﬁbrations, we conclude that the inclusion Post+(C) ⊆
Post′(C) is an equivalence, so that Post+(C) = Post′(C). This proves that (1) ⇔ (2).

≥0)op → X is highly
Remark 5.5.6.27. Let C be a presentable ∞-category. We will say that a tower X : N(Z∞
connected if, for every n ≥ 0, there exists an integer k such that the induced map τ≤nX(∞) → τ≤nX(k′)
is an equivalence for k′ ≥ k. We will say that a pretower Y : N(Z≥0) → X is highly connected if, for every
n ≥ 0, there exists an integer k such that the map τ≤nY (k′′) → τ≤nY (k′) is an equivalence for k′′ ≥ k′ ≥ k.
It is clear that every Postnikov (pre)tower is highly connected. Conversely, if X is a highly connected tower
and its underlying pretower is highly connected, then X is a Postnikov tower. Indeed, for each n ≥ 0 we can
choose k ≥ n such that the map τ≤nX(∞) → τ≤nX(k) is an equivalence. Since X is a Postnikov pretower,
this induces an equivalence τ≤nX(∞) ≃ X(n). Consequently, to establish the implication (2) ⇒ (1) in the
criterion of Proposition 5.5.6.26, it suﬃces to verify the following:

(∗) Let X : N(Z∞

≥ ) → C be a tower in C. Assume that X is a limit diagram, and that the underlying

pretower is highly connected. Then X is highly connected.

In §7.2.1, we will apply this criterion to prove that Postnikov towers are convergent in a large class of
∞-topoi.

We conclude this section with a useful compatibility property between truncation functors in diﬀerent

∞-categories:

Proposition 5.5.6.28. Let C and D be presentable ∞-categories, and let F : C → D be a left-exact pre-
sentable functor. Then there is an equivalence of functors F ◦ τ C

≤k ≃ τ D

≤k ◦ F .

Proof. Since F is left exact, it restricts to a functor from τ≤k C to τ≤k D by Proposition 5.5.6.16. We therefore
have a diagram

associated diagram of right adjoints

5.5.7 Compactly Generated ∞-Categories

Deﬁnition 5.5.7.1. Let κ be a regular cardinal. We will say that an ∞-category C is κ-compactly generated
if it is presentable and κ-accessible. When κ = ω, we will simply say that C is compactly generated.

The proof of Theorem 5.5.1.1 shows that an ∞-category C is κ-compactly generated if and only if there
exists a small ∞-category D which admits κ-small colimits, and an equivalence C ≃ Indκ(D). In fact, we can
choose D to be (a minimal model of) the ∞-category of κ-compact objects of C. We would like to assert that
this construction establishes an equivalence between two sorts of ∞-categories. In order to make this precise,
we need to introduce the appropriate notion of functor between κ-compactly generated ∞-categories.

Proposition 5.5.7.2. Let κ be a regular cardinal, and let C

F /
G

/ D

be a pair of adjoint functors, where C

and D admit small, κ-ﬁltered colimits.

(1) If G is κ-continuous, then F carries κ-compact objects of C to κ-compact objects of D.

(2) Conversely, if C is κ-accessible and F preserves κ-compactness, then G is κ-continuous.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that G is κ-continuous, and let C ∈ C be a κ-compact object. Let e : C →
corepresented by C. Then e ◦ G : D →
e ◦ G; this proves (1).

S is corepresented by F (C). Since e and G are κ-continuous, so is

b

Conversely, suppose that F preserves κ-compact objects and that C is κ-accessible. Without loss of
generality, we may suppose that there is a small ∞-category C′ such that C = Indκ(C′) ⊆ P(C′). We wish
to prove that G is κ-continuous. Since Indκ(C′) is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits in P(C′), it will suﬃce to
prove that the composite map

b

θ : D G

→ C ⊆ P(C′)

is κ-continuous. In view of Proposition 5.1.2.2, it will suﬃce to prove that for every object C ∈ C′, the
composition of θ with evaluation at C is a κ-continuous functor. We conclude by observing that this
functor is corepresentable by the image under F of j(C) ∈ C (here j : C′ → Indκ(C) denotes the Yoneda
embedding).

Corollary 5.5.7.3. Let C be a κ-compactly generated ∞-category, and let L : C → C be a localization
functor. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The functor L is κ-continuous.

(2) The full subcategory L C ⊆ C is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits.

Suppose that these conditions are satisﬁed. Then:

(3) The functor L carries κ-compact objects of C to κ-compact objects of L C.

(4) The ∞-category L C is κ-compactly generated.

(5) An object D ∈ L C is κ-compact (in L C) if and only if there exists a compact object C ∈ C such that

D is a retract of LC.

Proof. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed. Let p : K → L C be a κ-ﬁltered diagram. Then the natural transfor-
mation p → Lp is an equivalence. Using (1), we conclude that the induced map lim
(p) is an
−→
equivalence, so that lim
−→

Conversely, if (2) is satisﬁed, then the inclusion L C ⊆ C is κ-continuous, so that L : C → C is a

(p) ∈ L C. This proves (2).

composition of κ-continuous functors

C L→ L C → C,

which proves (1).

Assume that (1) and (2) are satisﬁed. Then L is accessible, so that L C is a presentable ∞-category.
Assertion (3) follows from Proposition 5.5.7.2. Let D ∈ L C. Since C is κ-compactly generated, D can be
written as the colimit of a κ-ﬁltered diagram p : K → C taking values in the κ-compact objects of C. Then
D ≃ LD can be written as the colimit of L ◦ p, which takes values κ-compact objects of L C. This proves
(4). If D is a κ-compact object of D, then we deduce that the identity map idD : D → D factors through
(L ◦ p)(k) for some vertex k ∈ K, which proves (5).

Corollary 5.5.7.4. Let C be a κ-compactly generated ∞-category, and let n ≥ −2. Then:

(1) The full subcategory τ≤n C is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits in C.

(2) The truncation functor τ≤n : C → C is κ-continuous.

(3) The truncation functor τ≤n carries compact objects of C to compact objects of C≤n.

405

(4) The full subcategory τ≤n C is κ-compactly generated.

(5) An object C ∈ τ≤n C is compact (in τ≤n C) if and only if there exists a compact object C′ ∈ C such that

C is a retract of τ≤nC′.

Proof. Corollary 5.5.7.3 shows that condition (1) implies (2), (3), (4), and (5). Consequently, it will suﬃce
to prove that (1) is satisﬁed.

Let C be an object of C. We will show that C is n-truncated if and only if the space MapC(D, C) is
n-truncated, for every κ-compact object D ∈ C. The “only if” direction is obvious. For the converse, let
FC : Cop → S be the functor represented by C, and let C′ ⊆ C be the full subcategory of C spanned by those
objects D such that FC (D) is n-truncated. Since FC preserves limits, C′ is stable under colimits in C. If C′
contains every κ-compact object of C, then C′ = C (since C is κ-compactly generated).

Now suppose that D is a κ-compact object of C, let GD : C → S be the functor co-represented by D, and
let C(D) ⊆ C be the full subcategory of C spanned by those objects C for which GD(C) is n-truncated. Then
D C(D). To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that each C(D) is stable under κ-ﬁltered
τ≤n C =
colimits. Since GD is κ-continuous, it suﬃces to observe that τ≤n S is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits in
S.

small colimits) by the essential images of the functors Fα. Since each Cα is generated under colimits by
κ-compact objects, and the functors Fα preserve colimits and κ-compact objects (Proposition 5.5.7.2), we
conclude that C is generated under colimits by its κ-compact objects, as desired.

Remark 5.5.7.9. If κ > ω, then Corollary 4.4.5.16 shows that the hypothesis of idempotent completeness

Proof. The only additional ingredient needed is the following observation: if C is an ∞-category which admits

observe that C′ can be identiﬁed with the collection of κ-compact objects of Indκ(C) (Lemma 5.4.2.4). Since
C admits all small colimits (Theorem 5.5.1.1), we conclude that C′ admits κ-small colimits.

We conclude with a remark about the structure of the ∞-category CatRex(κ)

∞

Proposition 5.5.7.11. Let κ be a regular cardinal. Then the ∞-category CatRex(κ)

Proof. Let I be a small, κ-ﬁltered ∞-category, and let p : I → CatRex(κ)
the induced diagram I → Cat∞. To complete the proof we must prove the following:

(i) The ∞-category C admits κ-small colimits.

(ii) For each I ∈ I, the associated functor p(I) → C preserves κ-small colimits.

(iii) Let f : C → D be an arbitrary functor. If each of the compositions p(I) → C → D preserves κ-small

colimits, then f preserves κ-small colimits.

Since I is κ-ﬁltered, any κ-small diagram in C factors through one of the maps p(I) → C ( Proposition
5.4.1.2 ). Thus (ii) ⇒ (i) and (ii) ⇒ (iii). To prove (ii), we ﬁrst use Proposition 5.3.1.16 to reduce to
the case where I ≃ N(A), where A is a κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set. Using Proposition 4.2.4.4, we can
reduce to the case where p is the nerve of a functor from q : A → Set∆. In view of Theorem 4.2.4.1, we
can identify C with a homotopy colimit of q. Since the collection of categorical equivalences is stable under
ﬁltered colimits, we can assume that C is actually the ﬁltered colimit of a family of ∞-categories {Cα}α∈A.
Let K be a κ-small simplicial set, and let gα : K ⊲ → Cα be a colimit diagram. We wish to show that the
induced map g : K ⊲ → C is a colimit diagram. Let g = g|K; we need to show that the map θ : Cg/ → Cg/
is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. We observe that θ is a ﬁltered colimit of maps θβ : (Cβ)gβ / → (Cβ)gβ /, where β
ranges over the set {β ∈ A : β ≥ α}. Using the fact that each of the associated maps Cα → Cβ preserves
κ-small colimits, we conclude that each θβ is a trivial ﬁbration, so that θ is a trivial ﬁbration as desired.

5.5.8 Nonabelian Derived Categories

According to Corollary 4.2.3.11, we can analyze arbitrary colimits in an ∞-category C in terms of ﬁnite
colimits and ﬁltered colimits. In particular, suppose that C admits ﬁnite colimits and that we construct
new ∞-category Ind(C) by formally adjoining ﬁltered colimits to C. Then Ind(C) admits all small colimits
(Theorem 5.5.1.1), and the Yoneda embedding C → Ind(C) preserves ﬁnite colimits (Proposition 5.3.5.14).
Moreover, we can identify Ind(C) with the ∞-category of functors Cop → S which carry ﬁnite colimits in C
to ﬁnite limits in S. In this section, we will introduce a variation on the same theme. Instead of assuming C
admits all ﬁnite colimits, we will only assume that C admits ﬁnite coproducts. We will construct a coproduct-
preserving embedding of C into a larger ∞-category PΣ(C) which admits all small colimits. Moreover, we

407

can characterize PΣ(C) as the ∞-category obtained from C by formally adjoining colimits of sifted diagrams
(Proposition 5.5.8.15).

Our ﬁrst goal in this section is to introduce the notion of a sifted simplicial set. We begin with a bit of
motivation. Let C denote the (ordinary) category of groups. Then C admits arbitrary colimits. However,
colimits of diagrams in C can be very diﬃcult to analyze, even if the diagram itself is quite simple. For
example, the coproduct of a pair of groups G and H is the amalgamated product G ⋆ H. The group G ⋆ H is
typically very complicated, even when G and H are not. For example, the amalgamated product Z/2Z⋆Z/3Z
is isomorphic to arithmetic group PSL2(Z). In general, G ⋆ H is much larger than the coproduct G
H
of the underlying sets of G and H. In other words, the forgetful functor U : C → Set does not preserve
coproducts. However, U does preserve some colimits: for example, the colimit of a sequence of groups

`

G0 → G1 → . . .

can be obtained by taking the colimit of the underlying sets, and equipping the result with an appropriate
group structure.

The forgetful functor U from groups to sets preserves another important type of colimit: namely, the
formation of quotients by equivalence relations. If G is a group, then a subgroup R ⊆ G× G is an equivalence
relation on G if and only if there exists a normal subgroup H ⊆ G such that R = {(g, g′) : g−1g′ ∈ H}. In
this case, the set of R-equivalence classes in G is in bijection with the quotient G/H, which inherits a group
structure from G. In other words, the quotient of G by the equivalence relation R can be computed either
in the category of groups or the category of sets; the result is the same.

Each of the examples given above admits a generalization: the colimit of a sequence is a special case of
a ﬁltered colimit, and the quotient by an equivalence relation is a special case of a reﬂexive coequalizer. The
forgetful functor C → Set preserves ﬁltered colimits and reﬂexive coequalizers; moreover, the same is true if
we replace the category of groups by any other category of sets with some sort of ﬁnitary algebraic structure
(for example, abelian groups, or commutative rings). The following deﬁnition, which is taken from [66], is
an attempt to axiomatize the essence of the situation:

Deﬁnition 5.5.8.1 ([66]). A simplicial set K is sifted if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) The simplicial set K is nonempty.

(2) The diagonal map K → K × K is coﬁnal.

Warning 5.5.8.2. In [66], Rosicki uses the term homotopy sifted to describe the analogue of Deﬁnition
5.5.8.1 for simplicial categories, and reserves the term sifted for analogous notion in the setting of ordinary
categories. There is some danger of confusion with our terminology: if C is an ordinary category and N(C) is
sifted (in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.5.8.1), then C is sifted in the sense of [66]. However, the converse is false
in general.

Example 5.5.8.3. Every ﬁltered ∞-category is sifted (Proposition 5.3.1.20).

Lemma 5.5.8.4. The simplicial set N(∆)op is sifted.

Proof. Since N(∆)op is clearly nonempty, it will suﬃce to show that the diagonal map N(∆)op → N(∆)op ×
N(∆)op is coﬁnal. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, this is equivalent to the assertion that for every object
([m], [n]) ∈ ∆ × ∆, the category

C = ∆/[m] ×∆ ∆/[n]

has weakly contractible nerve. Let C0 be the full subcategory of C spanned by those objects which correspond
to monomorphisms of partially ordered sets J → [m] × [n]. The inclusion of C0 into C has a left adjoint, so
the inclusion N(C0) ⊆ N(C) is a weak homotopy equivalence. It will therefore suﬃce to show that N(C0) is
weakly contractible. We now observe that N(C0) can be identiﬁed with the ﬁrst barycentric subdivision of
∆m × ∆n, and is therefore weakly homotopy equivalent to ∆m × ∆n and so weakly contractible.

408

Remark 5.5.8.5. The formation of geometric realization of simplicial objects should be thought of as the
∞-categorical analogue of the formation of reﬂexive coequalizers.

Our next pair of results captures some of the essential features of the theory of sifted simplicial sets:

Proposition 5.5.8.6. Let K be a sifted simplicial set, let C, D, and E be ∞-categories which admit K-
indexed colimits, and let f : C × D → E be a map which preserves K-indexed colimits separately in each
variable. Then f preserves K-indexed colimits.

Proof. Let p : K → C and q : K → D be diagrams indexed by a small simplicial set K, and let δ : K → K ×K
be the diagonal map. Using the fact that f preserves K-indexed colimits separately in each variable and
(f ◦ (p × q)) is a colimit for the diagram f ◦ (p × q) ◦ δ. Consequently, f
Lemma 5.5.2.3, we conclude that lim
−→
preserves K-indexed colimits provided that the diagonal δ is coﬁnal. We conclude by invoking the assumption
that K is sifted.

Proposition 5.5.8.7. Let K be a sifted simplicial set. Then K is weakly contractible.

Proof. Choose a vertex x in K. According to Whitehead’s theorem, it will suﬃce to show that for each
n ≥ 0, the homotopy set πn(|K|, x) consists of a single element. Let δ : K → K × K be the diagonal map.
Since δ is coﬁnal, Proposition 4.1.1.3 implies that the induced map

πn(|K|, x) → πn(|K × K|, δ(x)) ≃ πn(|K|, x) × πn(|K|, x)

is bijective. Since πn(|K|, x) is nonempty, we conclude that it is a singleton.

We now return to the problem introduced in the beginning of this section.

Deﬁnition 5.5.8.8. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite coproducts. We let PΣ(C) denote the
full subcategory of P(C) spanned by those functors Cop → S which preserve ﬁnite products.

Remark 5.5.8.9. The ∞-categories of the form PΣ(C) have been studied in [66], where they are called
homotopy varieties. Many of the results proven below can also be found in [66].

Proposition 5.5.8.10. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite coproducts. Then:

(1) The ∞-category PΣ(C) is an accessible localization of P(C).

(2) The Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C) factors through PΣ(C). Moreover, j carries ﬁnite coproducts in C

to ﬁnite coproducts in PΣ(C).

(3) Let D be a presentable ∞-category, and let

P(C)

F

G

/ D

be a pair of adjoint functors. Then G factors through PΣ(C) if and only if f = F ◦ j : C → D preserves
ﬁnite coproducts.

(4) The full subcategory PΣ(C) ⊆ P(C) is stable under sifted colimits.

(5) Let L : P(C) → PΣ(C) be a left adjoint to the inclusion. Then L preserves sifted colimits (when regarded

as a functor from P(C) to itself).

(6) The ∞-category PΣ(C) is compactly generated.

Before giving the proof, we need a preliminary result concerning the interactions between products sifted

colimits.

Lemma 5.5.8.11. Let K be a sifted simplicial set. Let X be an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite products and
K-indexed colimits, and suppose that the formation of products in X preserves K-indexed colimits separately
in each variable. Then the colimit functor lim
−→

: Fun(K, X) → X preserves ﬁnite products.

Remark 5.5.8.12. The hypotheses of Lemma 5.5.8.11 are satisﬁed when X is the ∞-category S of spaces:
see Lemma 6.1.3.14. More generally, Lemma 5.5.8.11 applies whenever the ∞-category X is an ∞-topos (see
Deﬁnition 6.1.0.2).

Proof. Since the simplicial set K is weakly contractible (Proposition 5.5.8.7), Corollary 4.4.4.9 implies that
the functor lim
preserves ﬁnal objects. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the functor lim

colimits, which follows immediately by applying Proposition 5.5.8.6 to the Cartesian product functor X × X →

Proof of Proposition 5.5.8.10. Assertion (1) is an immediate consequence of Lemmas 5.5.4.17, 5.5.4.18, and
5.5.4.19. To prove (2), it will suﬃce to show that for every representable functor e : PΣ(C)op → S, the
composition

Cop jop

→ PΣ(C)op e→ S

preserves ﬁnite products (Proposition 5.1.3.2). This is obvious, since the composition can be identiﬁed with
the object of PΣ(C) ⊆ Fun(Cop, S) representing e.

We next prove (3). We note that f preserves ﬁnite coproducts if and only if, for every object D ∈ D, the

composition

Cop f op

→ Dop eD→ S

preserves ﬁnite products, where eD denotes the functor represented by D. This composition can be identiﬁed
with G(D), so that f preserves ﬁnite coproducts if and only if G factors through PΣ(C).

Assertion (4) is an immediate consequence of Lemma 5.5.8.11 and Remark 5.5.8.12, and (5) follows
formally from (4). To prove (6), we ﬁrst observe that P(C) is compactly generated (Proposition 5.3.5.12).
Let E ⊆ P(C) be the full subcategory spanned by the compact objects, and let L : P(C) → PΣ(C) be a
localization functor. Since E generates P(C) under ﬁltered colimits, L(D) generates PΣ(C) under ﬁltered
colimits. Consequently, it will suﬃce to show that for each E ∈ E, the object LE ∈ PΣ(C) is compact. Let
f : PΣ(C) → S be the functor corepresented by LE, and let f ′ : P(C) → S be the functor corepresented by
E. Then the map E → LE induces an equivalence f → f ′| PΣ(C). Since f ′ is continuous and PΣ(C) is stable
under ﬁltered colimits in P(C), we conclude that f is continuous, so that LE is a compact object of PΣ(C)
as desired.

Our next goal is to prove a converse to part (4) of Proposition 5.5.8.10. Namely, we will show that PΣ(C)
is generated by the essential image of the Yoneda embedding under sifted colimits. In fact, we will only need
to use special types of sifted colimits: namely, ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations (Lemma 5.5.8.14).
The proof is based on the following technical result:

Lemma 5.5.8.13. Let C be a small ∞-category, and let X be an object of P(C). Then there exists a simplicial
object Y• : N(∆)op → P(C) with the following properties:

(1) The colimit of Y• is equivalent to X.

(2) For each n ≥ 0, the object Yn ∈ P(C) is equivalent to a small coproduct of objects lying in the image of

the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C).

We will defer the proof until the end of this section.

Lemma 5.5.8.14. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite coproducts, and let X ∈ P(C). The
following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The object X belongs to PΣ(C).

(2) There exists a simplicial object U• : N(∆)op → Ind(C) whose colimit in P(C) is X.

Proof. The full subcategory PΣ(C) contains the essential image of the Yoneda embedding and is stable
under ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations (Proposition 5.5.8.10); thus (2) ⇒ (1). We will prove that
(1) ⇒ (2).

We ﬁrst choose a simplicial object Y• of P(C) which satisﬁes the conclusions of Lemma 5.5.8.13. Let
L be a left adjoint to the inclusion PΣ(C) ⊆ P(C). Since X is a colimit of Y•, LX ≃ X is a colimit of
LY• (part (5) of Proposition 5.5.8.10). It will therefore suﬃce to prove that each LYn belongs to Ind(C).
α∈A j(Cα), where j : C → P(C) denotes the
By hypothesis, each Yn can be written as a small coproduct
Yoneda embedding. Using the results of §4.2.3, we see that Yn can be obtained also as a ﬁltered colimit of

j(Cα), where A0 ranges over the ﬁnite subsets of A. Since L preserves ﬁltered colimits
(Proposition 5.5.8.10), it will suﬃce to show that each of the objects

L(

j(Cα))

aα∈A0

belongs to Ind(C). We now invoke part (2) of Proposition 5.5.8.10 to identify this object with j(

α∈A0

Cα).

Proposition 5.5.8.15. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite coproducts, and let D be an ∞-
category which admits ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations. Let FunΣ(PΣ(C), D) denote the full sub-
category spanned by those functors PΣ(C) → D which preserve ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations.
Then:

(1) Composition with the Yoneda embedding j : C → PΣ(C) induces an equivalence of categories

`

θ : FunΣ(PΣ(C), D) → Fun(C, D).

(2) Any functor g ∈ FunΣ(PΣ(C), D) preserves sifted colimits.

(3) Assume that D admits ﬁnite coproducts. A functor g ∈ FunΣ(PΣ(C), D) preserves small colimits if and

only if g ◦ j preserves ﬁnite coproducts.

Proof. Lemma 5.5.8.14 and Proposition 5.5.8.10 imply that PΣ(C) is the smallest full subcategory of P(C)
which is closed under ﬁltered colimits, closed under geometric realizations, and contains the essential image
of the Yoneda embedding. Consequently, assertion (1) follows from Remark 5.3.5.9 and Proposition 4.3.2.15.
We now prove (2). Let g ∈ FunΣ(PΣ(C), D); we wish to show that g preserves sifted colimits. It will
suﬃce to show that for every representable functor e : D → Sop, the composition e ◦ g preserves sifted
colimits. In other words, we may replace D by Sop, and thereby reduce to the case where D itself admits
sifted colimits. Let Fun′
Σ(PΣ(C), D) denote the full subcategory of FunΣ(PΣ(C), D) spanned by those functors
which preserve sifted colimits. Since PΣ(C) is also the smallest full subcategory of P(C) which contains the
essential image of the Yoneda embedding and is stable under sifted colimits, Remark 5.3.5.9 implies that θ
induces an equivalence

Fun′

Σ(PΣ(C), D) → Fun(C, D).

Combining this observation with (1), we deduce that the inclusion Fun′
equivalence of ∞-categories, and therefore an equality.

Σ(PΣ(C), D) ⊆ FunΣ(PΣ(C), D) is an

The “only if” direction of (3) is immediate, since the Yoneda embedding j : C → PΣ(C) preserves ﬁnite
coproducts (Proposition 5.5.8.10). To prove the converse, we ﬁrst apply Lemma 5.3.5.7 to reduce to the case
where D is a full subcategory of an ∞-category D′, with the following properties:

411

(i) The ∞-category D′ admits small colimits.

(ii) A small diagram K ⊲ → D is a colimit if and only if the induced diagram K ⊲ → D′ is a colimit.
Let C′ denote the essential image of the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C). Using Lemma 5.1.5.5, we conclude
that there exists functor G : P(C) → D′ which is a left Kan extension of G| C′ = g| C′, and that G preserves
small colimits. Let G0 = G| PΣ(C). Then G0 is a left Kan extension of g| C′, so there is a canonical natural
transformation G0 → g. Let C′′ denote the full subcategory of PΣ(C) spanned by those objects C for which
the map G0(C) → g(C) is an equivalence. Then C′′ contains C′ and is stable under ﬁltered colimits and
geometric realizations, and therefore contains all of PΣ(C). We may therefore replace g by G0 and thereby
assume that G| PΣ(C) = g. Since G ◦ j = g ◦ j preserves ﬁnite coproducts, the right adjoint to G factors
through PΣ(C) (Proposition 5.5.8.10), so that G is equivalent to the composition

P(C) L→ PΣ(C) G′
for some colimit-preserving functor G′ : PΣ(C) → D′. Restricting to the subcategory PΣ(C) ⊆ P(C), we
deduce that G′ is equivalent to g, so that g preserves small colimits as desired.

→ D′

Remark 5.5.8.16. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite coproducts. It follows from Proposition
5.5.8.15 that we can identify PΣ(C) with PK′
K (C) in each of the following three cases (for an explanation of
this notation, we refer the reader to §5.3.6):

(1) The collection K is empty, and the collection K′ consists of all small ﬁltered simplicial sets together

with N(∆)op.

(2) The collection K is empty, and the collection K′ consists of all small sifted simplicial sets.

(3) The collection K consists of all ﬁnite discrete simplicial sets, and the collection K′ consists of all small

simplicial sets.

Corollary 5.5.8.17. Let f : C → D be a functor between ∞-categories. Assume that C admits small colimits.
Then f preserves sifted colimits if and only if f preserves ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations.

Proof. The “only if” direction is clear. For the converse, suppose that f preserves ﬁltered colimits and
geometric realizations. Let I be a small sifted ∞-category and p : I⊲ → C a colimit diagram; we wish to
prove that f ◦ p is also a colimit diagram. Let p = p| I. Let J ⊆ P(I) denote a small full subcategory which
contains the essential image of the Yoneda embedding j : I → P(I) and is closed under ﬁnite coproducts. It
follows from Remark 5.3.5.9 that the functor p is homotopic to a composition q ◦ j, where q : J → C is a
functor which preserves ﬁnite coproducts. Proposition 5.5.8.15 implies that q is homotopic to a composition

J j′

→ PΣ(J)

q′
→ C,

where j′ denotes the Yoneda embedding and q′ preserves small colimits. The composition f ◦ q′ preserves
ﬁltered colimits and geometric realization, and therefore preserves sifted colimits (Proposition 5.5.8.15).

Let p′ : I⊲ → PΣ(J) be a colimit of the diagram j′ ◦ j. Since q′ preserves colimits, the composition q′ ◦ p′ is
a colimit of q′ ◦j′ ◦j ≃ p, and is therefore equivalent to p. Consequently, it will suﬃce to show that f ◦q′ ◦p′ is
a colimit diagram. Since I is sifted, we need only verify that f ◦ q′ preserves sifted colimits. By Proposition
5.5.8.15, it will suﬃce to show that f ◦ q′ preserves ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations. Since q′
preserves all colimits, this follows from our assumption that f preserves ﬁltered colimits and geometric
realizations.

In the situation of Proposition 5.5.8.15, every functor f : C → D extends (up to homotopy) to a functor
F : PΣ(C) → D, which preserves sifted colimits. We will sometimes refer to F as the left derived functor of
f . In §5.5.9 we will explain the connection of this notion of derived functor with the more classical deﬁnition
provided by Quillen’s theory of homotopical algebra.

Our next goal is to characterize those ∞-categories which have the form PΣ(C).

412

Deﬁnition 5.5.8.18. Let C be an ∞-category which admits geometric realizations of simplicial objects.
We will say that an object P ∈ C is projective if the functor C → S co-represented by P commutes with
geometric realizations.

Remark 5.5.8.19. Let C be an ∞-category which admits geometric realizations of simplicial objects. Then
the collection of projective objects of C is stable under all ﬁnite coproducts which exist in C. This follows
immediately from Lemma 5.5.8.11 and Remark 5.5.8.12.

Remark 5.5.8.20. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits, and let X be an object of C. Then
X is compact and projective if and only if X corepresents a functor C → Set∆ which preserves sifted colimits.
The “only if” direction is obvious, and the converse follows from Corollary 5.5.8.17.

Example 5.5.8.21. Let A be an abelian category. Then an object P ∈ A is projective in the sense of classical
homological algebra (that is, the functor HomA(P, •) is exact) if and only if P corepresents a functor A → Set
which commutes with geometric realizations of simplicial objects. This is not equivalent to the condition
of Deﬁnition 5.5.8.18, since the fully faithful embedding Set → S does not preserve geometric realizations.
However, it is equivalent to the requirement that P be a projective object (in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.5.8.18)
in the ∞-category underlying the homotopy theory of simplicial objects of A (equivalently, the theory of
nonpositively graded chain complexes with values in A; we will discuss this example in greater detail in [50]).

Proposition 5.5.8.22. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite coproducts, D an ∞-category
which admits ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations, and F : PΣ(C) → D a left derived functor of
f = F ◦ j : C → D, where j : C → PΣ(C) denotes the Yoneda embedding. Consider the following conditions:

(i) The functor f is fully faithful.

(ii) The essential image of f consists of compact projective objects of D.

(iii) The ∞-category D is generated by the essential image of f under ﬁltered colimits and geometric real-

izations.

If (i) and (ii) are satisﬁed, then F is fully faithful. Moreover, F is an equivalence if and only if (i), (ii),
and (iii) are satisﬁed.

Proof. If F is an equivalence of ∞-categories, then (i) follows from Proposition 5.1.3.1, and (iii) from Lemma
5.5.8.14. To prove (ii), it suﬃces to show that for each C ∈ C, the functor e : PΣ(C) → S corepresented by
C preserves ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations. We can identify e with the composition

PΣ(C)

e′
⊆ P(C) e′′

→ S,

where e′′ denotes evaluation at C. It now suﬃces to observe that e′ and e′′ preserve ﬁltered colimits and
geometric realizations (Lemma 5.5.8.14 and Proposition 5.1.2.2).

For the converse, let us suppose that (i) and (ii) are satisﬁed. We will show that F is fully faithful. First
σ(C) be the full subcategory of PΣ(C) spanned by those objects M for which

ﬁx an object C ∈ C, and let P′
the map

MapPΣ(C)(j(C), M ) → MapD(f (C), F (M ))

is an equivalence. Condition (i) implies that P′
implies that P′
that P′

σ(C) contains the essential image of j, and condition (ii)
σ(C) is stable under ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations. Lemma 5.5.8.14 now implies

Σ(C) to be the full subcategory of PΣ(C) spanned by those objects M such that for all

Σ(C) = PΣ(C).
We now deﬁne P′′
N ∈ PΣ(C), the map

MapPΣ(C)(M, N ) → MapD(F (M ), F (N ))

413

is a homotopy equivalence. The above argument shows that P′′
F preserves ﬁltered colimits and geometric realizations, P′′
realizations. Applying Lemma 5.5.8.14, we conclude that P′′

Σ(C) contains the essential image of j. Since
Σ(C) is stable under ﬁltered colimits and geometric
Σ(C) = PΣ(C); this proves that F is fully faithful.
If F is fully faithful, then the essential image of F contains f (C) and is stable under ﬁltered colimits and

geometric realizations. If (iii) is satisﬁed, it follows that F is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Deﬁnition 5.5.8.23. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits, and let S be a collection of
objects of C. We will say that S is a set of compact projective generators for C if the following conditions
are satisﬁed:

(1) Each element of S is a compact projective object of C.

(2) The full subcategory of C spanned by the elements of S is essentially small.

(3) The set S generates C under small colimits.

We will say that C is projectively generated if there exists a set S of compact projective generators for C.

Example 5.5.8.24. The ∞-category S of spaces is projectively generated. The compact projective objects
of S are precisely those spaces which are homotopy equivalent to ﬁnite sets (endowed with the discrete
topology).

Proposition 5.5.8.25. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small colimits, and let S be a set of compact
projective generators for C. Then:

(1) Let C0 ⊆ C be the full subcategory spanned by ﬁnite coproducts of the objects S, let D ⊆ C0 be a
minimal model for C0, and let F : PΣ(D) → C be a left derived functor of the inclusion. Then F is an
equivalence of ∞-categories. In particular, C is a compactly generated presentable ∞-category.

(2) Let C ∈ C be an object. The following conditions are equivalent:

(i) The object C is compact and projective.

(ii) The functor e : C →
(iii) There exists an object C′ ∈ C0 such that C is a retract of C′.

S corepresented by C preserves sifted colimits.

b

Proof. Remark 5.5.8.19 implies that C0 consists of compact projective objects of C. Assertion (1) now follows
immediately from Proposition 5.5.8.22. We now prove (2). The implications (iii) ⇒ (i) and (ii) ⇒ (i)
are obvious. To complete the proof, we will show that (i) ⇒ (iii). Using (1), we are free to assume
C = PΣ(D). Let C ∈ C be a compact projective object. Using Lemma 5.5.8.14, we conclude that there
exists a simplicial object X• of Ind(D) and an equivalence C ≃ |X•|. Since C is projective, we deduce
MapC(C, C) is equivalent to the geometric realization of the simplicial space MapC(C, X•). In particular,
idC ∈ MapC(C, C) is homotopic to the image of the some map f : C → X0. Using our assumption that C
is compact, we conclude that f factors as a composition

C

f0→ j(D) → X0,

where j : D → Ind(D) denotes the Yoneda embedding.
desired.

It follows that C is a retract of j(D) in C, as

Remark 5.5.8.26. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite coproducts. Since the truncation
functor τ≤n : S → S preserves ﬁnite products, it induces a map τ : PΣ(C) → PΣ(C), which is easily seen to be
a localization functor. The essential image of τ consists of those functors F ∈ PΣ(C) which take n-truncated
values. We claim that these are precisely the n-truncated object of PΣ(C). Consequently, we can identify τ
with the n-truncation functor on PΣ(C).

414

One direction is clear: if F ∈ PΣ(C) is n-truncated, then for each C ∈ C the space MapPΣ(C)(j(C), F ) ≃
F (C) must be n-truncated. Conversely, suppose that F : Cop → S takes n-truncated values. We wish to
prove that the space MapPΣ(C)(F ′, F ) is n-truncated, for each F ′ ∈ PΣ(C). The collection of all objects F ′
which satisfy this condition is stable under small colimits in PΣ(C) and contains the essential image of the
Yoneda embedding. It therefore contains the entirety of PΣ(C), as desired.

We conclude this section by giving the proof of Lemma 5.5.8.13. Our argument uses some concepts and

results from §6, and may be omitted at ﬁrst reading.

Proof of Lemma 5.5.8.13. For n ≥ 0, let ∆≤n denote the full subcategory of ∆ spanned by the objects
{[k]}k≤n. We will construct a compatible sequence of functors fn : N(∆≤n)op → P(C)/X with the following
properties:

(A) For n ≥ 0, let Ln denote a colimit of the composite diagram

N(∆≤n−1)op ×N(∆)op N(∆[n]/)op → N(∆≤n−1)op fn−1→ P(C)/X → P(C).

(the nth latching object). Then there exists an object Zn ∈ P(C) which is a small coproduct of objects
in the essential image of the Yoneda embedding C → P(C), and a map Zn → fn([n]) which, together
with the canonical map Ln → fn([n]), determines an equivalence Ln

Zn ≃ fn([n]).

(B) For n ≥ 0, let M n denote the limit of the diagram

`

N(∆≤n−1)op ×N(∆)op N(∆/[n])op → N(∆≤n−1)op fn−1→ P(C)/X

(the nth matching object), and let Mn denote its image in P(C). Then the canonical map fn([n]) → Mn
is an eﬀective epimorphism in P(C) (see §6.2.3).

The construction of the functors fn proceeds by induction on n, the case n < 0 being trivial. For n ≥ 0,
we invoke Remark A.2.9.16: to extend fn−1 to a functor fn satisfying (A) and (B), it suﬃces to produce an
object Zn and a morphism ψ : Zn → Mn in P(C), such that the coproduct Ln
Zn → Mn is an eﬀective
epimorphism. This is satisﬁed in particular if ψ itself is an eﬀective epimorphism.
`

The maps fn together determine a simplicial object Y • of P(C)/X , which we can identify with a simplicial
object Y• in P(C) equipped with a map θ : lim
Y• → X. Assumption (B) guarantees that θ is a hypercovering
−→
of X (see §6.5.3), so that the map θ is ∞-connective (Lemma 6.5.3.11). The ∞-topos P(C) has enough points
(given by evaluation at objects of C), and is therefore hypercomplete (Remark 6.5.4.8). It follows that θ is an
[n]→[k] Zk
equivalence. We now complete the proof by observing that for n ≥ 0, we have an equivalence Yn ≃
where the coproduct is taken over all surjective maps of linearly ordered sets [n] → [k], so that Yn is itself a
small coproduct of objects lying in the essential image of the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C).

5.5.9 Quillen’s Model for PΣ(C)
Let C be a small category which admits ﬁnite products. Then N(C)op is an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite
coproducts. In §5.5.8, we studied the ∞-category PΣ(N(C)op), which we can view as the full subcategory
of Fun(N(C), S) spanned by those functors which preserve ﬁnite products. According to Proposition 4.2.4.4,
Fun(N(C), S) can be identiﬁed with the ∞-category underlying the simplicial model category of diagrams
SetC
∆ (which we will endow with the projective model structure described in §A.3.2). It follows that every
functor f : N(C) → S is equivalent to the (simplicial) nerve of a functor F : C → Kan. Moreover, f belongs
to PΣ(N(C)op) if and only if the functor F is weakly product preserving, in the sense that for any ﬁnite
collection of objects {Ci ∈ C}1≤i≤n, the natural map

F (C1 × . . . Cn) → F (C1) × . . . × F (Cn)

415

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes. Our goal in this section is to prove a reﬁnement of Proposition
if f preserves ﬁnite products, then it is possible to arrange that F preserves ﬁnite products (up
4.2.4.4:
to isomorphism, rather than up to homotopy equivalence). This result is most naturally phrased as an
equivalence between model categories (Proposition 5.5.9.2), and is due to Bergner (see [9]). We begin by
recalling the following result of Quillen (for a proof, we refer the reader to [63]):

Proposition 5.5.9.1 (Quillen). Let C be a category which admits ﬁnite products, and let A denote the
category of functors F : C → Set∆ which preserve ﬁnite products. Then A has the structure of a simplicial
model category, where:

(W ) A natural transformation α : F → F ′ of functors is a weak equivalence in A if and only if α(C) :

F (C) → F ′(C) is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets, for every C ∈ C.

(F ) A natural transformation α : F → F ′ of functors is a ﬁbration in A if and only if α(C) : F (C) → F ′(C)

is a Kan ﬁbration of simplicial sets, for every C ∈ C.

Suppose that C and A are as in the statement of Proposition 5.5.9.1. Then we may regard A as a full
subcategory of the category SetC
∆ of all functors from C to Set∆, which we regard as endowed with the
projective model structure (so that ﬁbrations and weak equivalences are given pointwise). The inclusion
G : A ⊆ SetC

∆ preserves ﬁbrations and trivial ﬁbrations, and therefore determines a Quillen adjunction

5.5.9.2. Then the natural map N(A◦) → PΣ(N(C)op) is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

The proof of Proposition 5.5.9.2 is somewhat technical and will occupy the rest of this section. We begin

by introducing some preliminaries.

Notation 5.5.9.4. Let C be a small category. We deﬁne a pair of categories Env(C) ⊆ Env+(C) as follows:

(i) An object of Env+(C) is a pair C = (J, {Cj}j∈J ), where J is a ﬁnite set and each Cj is an object of C.

The object C belongs to Env(C) if and only if J is nonempty.

(ii) Given objects C = (J, {Cj}j∈J ) and C′ = (J ′, {C′

j′ }j′∈J ′) of Env+(C), a morphism C → C′ consists of

the following data:

(a) A map f : J ′ → J of ﬁnite sets.
(b) For each j′ ∈ J ′, a morphism Cf (j′) → C′

j′ in the category C.

There is a fully faithful embedding functor θ : C → Env(C), given by C 7→ (∗, {C}). We can view Env+(C)
as the category obtained from C by freely adjoining ﬁnite products. In particular, if C admits ﬁnite products,
then θ admits a (product-preserving) left inverse φ+

will give an explicit construction of an inverse to u. For C ∈ C, we let Env+(C)/C denote the ﬁber product

It follows that the functor L+ : SetC

∆ factors through A, and can be identiﬁed with a left adjoint
to the inclusion A ⊆ SetC
∆. In order to prove Proposition 5.5.9.2, we need to be able to compute the functor
L+. We will do this in two steps: ﬁrst, we show that (under mild hypotheses), the natural transformation
L → L+ is a weak equivalence. Second, we will see that the colimit deﬁning L is actually a homotopy colimit,
and therefore has good properties. More precisely, we have the following pair of lemmas, whose proofs will
be given at the end of this section.

Lemma 5.5.9.7. Let C be a small category which admits ﬁnite products, and let F ∈ SetC
∆ be a functor which
carries the ﬁnal object of C to a contractible Kan complex K. Then the canonical map β : L(F) → L+(F) is
a weak equivalence in SetC
∆.

Lemma 5.5.9.8. Let C be a small simplicial category. If F is a projectively coﬁbrant object of SetC
E(F) is a projectively coﬁbrant object of SetEnv(C)

∆, then

∆

We are now almost ready to give the proof of Proposition 5.5.9.2. The essential step is contained in the

following result:

Lemma 5.5.9.9. Let C be a simplicial category ﬁnite admits ﬁnite products, and let

SetC
∆

F

G

/A

be as in the statement of Proposition 5.5.9.2. Then:

(1) The functors F and G are Quillen adjoints.

(2) If F ∈ SetC

∆ is projectively coﬁbrant and weakly product preserving, then the unit map F → (G ◦ F )(F)

is a weak equivalence.

Proof. Assertion (1) is obvious, since G preserves ﬁbrations and trivial coﬁbrations.
It follows that F
preserves weak equivalences between projectively coﬁbrant objects. Let K ∈ Set∆ denote the image under F
of the ﬁnal object of D. In proving (2), we are free to replace F by any weakly equivalent diagram which is
also projectively coﬁbrant. Choosing a ﬁbrant replacement for F, we may suppose that K is a Kan complex.
Since F is weakly product preserving, K is contractible.

In view of Lemma 5.5.9.6, we can identify the composition G ◦ F with L+ and the unit map with the

composition

F α→ L(F)

β
→ L+(F).

Lemma 5.5.9.7 implies that β is a weak equivalence. Consequently, it will suﬃce to show that α is a weak
equivalence.

We recall the construction of α. Let θ : C → Env(C) be as in Notation 5.5.9.4, so that there is a canonical
isomorphism F ≃ θ∗E(F). This isomorphism induces a natural transformation α : θ! F → E(F). The functor
α is obtained from α by applying the functor (φC)!, and identifying ((φC)! ◦ θ!)(F) with F. We observe

418

/
o

that (φC)! preserves weak equivalences between projectively coﬁbrant objects. Since θ! preserves projective
coﬁbrations, θ! F is projectively coﬁbrant. Lemma 5.5.9.8 asserts that E(F) is projectively coﬁbrant. Con-
sequently, it will suﬃce to prove that α is a weak equivalence in SetEnv(C)
. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, this
reduces to the condition that F be weakly compatible with (nonempty) products.

∆

Proof of Proposition 5.5.9.2. Lemma 5.5.9.9 shows that (F, G) is a Quillen adjunction. To complete the
proof, we must show:

(i) The counit transformation LF ◦ RG → id is an isomorphism of functors from the homotopy category

hA to itself.

(ii) The essential image of RG : hA → hSetC

∆ consists precisely of those functors which are weakly product-

preserving.

We observe that G preserves weak equivalences, so we can identify RG with G. Since G also detects
weak equivalences, (i) will follow if we can show that the induced transformation θ : G ◦ LF ◦ G → G is an
isomorphism of functors from the homotopy category hA to itself. This transformation has a right inverse,
given by composing the unit transformation id → G ◦ LF with G. Consequently, (i) follows immediately
from Lemma 5.5.9.9.

The image of G consists precisely of the product-preserving diagrams C → Set∆; it follows immediately
that every diagram in the essential image of G is weakly product preserving. Lemma 5.5.9.9 implies the
converse: every weakly product preserving functor belongs to the essential image of G. This proves (ii).

Remark 5.5.9.10. Proposition 5.5.9.2 can be generalized to the situation where C is a simplicial category
which admits ﬁnite products. We leave the necessary modiﬁcations to the reader.

It remains to prove Lemmas 5.5.9.8 and 5.5.9.7.

Proof of Lemma 5.5.9.8. For every object C ∈ C and every simplicial set K, we let FK

C → FK ′

∆ denote
C (D) = MapC(C, D) × K. A coﬁbration K → K ′ induces a projective
C . We will refer to a projective coﬁbration of this form as a generating projective

C ∈ SetC

The small object argument implies that if F ∈ SetC

∆, then there is a transﬁnite sequence

with the following properties:

(a) The functor F0 : D → Set∆ is constant, with value ∅.

F0 ⊆ F1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ Fα

(b) If λ ≤ α is a limit ordinal, then Fλ =

β<λ Fβ.
(c) For each β < α, the inclusion Fβ ⊆ Fβ+1 is a pushout of a generating projective coﬁbration.

S

(d) The functor F is a retract of Fα.

The functor G 7→ E(G) preserves initial objects, ﬁltered colimits, and retracts. Consequently, to show

that E(F) is projectively coﬁbrant, it will suﬃce to prove the following assertion:

corresponding simplex σ(j) : ∆n → G′(C′
j ). In this case, we can identify
σ(j) with an n-simplex of K ′ which does not belong to K. We will say that σ is of index ≤ k if the set
{σ(j) : j ∈ Jσ} has cardinality ≤ k. Note that σ can be of index smaller than the cardinality of Jσ, since it
is possible for σ(j) = σ(j′) ∈ MapSet∆(∆n, K ′) even if j 6= j′.

j) does not factor through G(C′

Let E(G′)(k)(C′) be the full simplicial subset of E(G′)(C′) spanned by those simplices which are of index
≤ k. It is easy to see that that E(G′)(k)(C′) depends functorially in C′, so we can view E(G′)(k) as an object
of SetEnv(C)
∆

. We observe that

E(G) ≃ E(G′)(0) ⊆ E(G′)(1) ⊆ . . .
and that the union of this sequence is E(G′). Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that each of the inclusions
E(G′)(k−1) ⊆ E(G′)(k) is a projective coﬁbration.

First, we need a bit of notation. Let us say that a simplex of K ′k is new if it consists of k distinct
simplices of K ′, none of which belong to K. We will say that a simplex of K ′k is old if it is not new. The
collection of old simplices of K ′k determine a simplicial subset which we will denote by K ′(k). We deﬁne a
functor ψ : Env(C) → Env(C) by the formula

ψ(J, {C′

j}j∈J ∪ {C}{1...k}).

There is an obvious map E(G)⊗K ′k → ψ∗E(G′)(k), which restricts to a map E(G)⊗K ′(k) → ψ∗E(G′)(k−1).

Passing to adjoints, we obtain a commutative diagram

ψ!(E(G) ⊗ K ′(k))

/ E(G′)(k−1)

ψ!(E(G) ⊗ K ′k)

/ E(G′)(k).

An easy computation shows that this diagram is coCartesian. Since E(G) is projectively coﬁbrant, the above
remarks imply that the left vertical map is a projective coﬁbration. It follows that the right vertical map is
a projective coﬁbration as well, which completes the proof.

The proof of Lemma 5.5.9.7 is somewhat more diﬃcult, and will require some preliminaries.

Notation 5.5.9.11. Let M : Set → Set be the covariant functor which associates to each set S the collection
of M(S) of nonempty ﬁnite subsets of S. If K is a simplicial set, we let M(K) denote the composition of K
with M, so that an m-simplex of M(K) is a ﬁnite nonempty collection of m-simplices of K.

Lemma 5.5.9.12. Let K be a ﬁnite simplicial set, let X ⊆ M(K ⊲) × ∆n be a simplicial subset with the
following properties:

(i) The projection X → ∆n is surjective.

(ii) If τ = (τ ′, τ ′′) : ∆m → M(K ⊲) × ∆n belongs to X, and τ ′ ⊆ τ ′ as subsets of HomSet∆(∆m, K ⊲), then

(τ ′, τ ′′) : ∆m → M(K ⊲) × ∆n belongs to X.

Then X is weakly contractible.

Proof. Let X ′ ⊆ X be the simplicial subset spanned by those simplices τ = (τ ′, τ ′′) : ∆m → M(K ⊲) × ∆n
which factor through X, and for which τ ′ ⊆ HomSet∆(∆m, K ⊲) includes the constant simplex at the cone
point of K ⊲. Our ﬁrst step is to show that X ′ is a deformation retract of X. More precisely, we will construct
a map

h : M(K ⊲) × ∆n × ∆1 → M(K ⊲) × ∆n

with the following properties:

(a) The map h carries X × ∆1 into X and X ′ × ∆1 into X ′.

(b) The restriction h| M(K ⊲) × ∆n × {0} is the identity map.

(c) The restriction h|X × {1} factors through X ′.

The map h will be the product of a map h′ : M(K ⊲)×∆1 → M(K ⊲) with the identity map on ∆n. To deﬁne h′,
we consider an arbitrary simplex τ : ∆m → M(K ⊲) × ∆1, corresponding to a subset S ⊆ HomSet∆ (∆m, K ⊲)
and a decomposition [m] = {0, . . . , i} ∪ {i + 1, . . . , m}. The subset h′(τ ) ⊆ HomSet∆ (∆m, K ⊲) is deﬁned as
follows: an arbitrary simplex σ : ∆m → K ⊲ belongs to h′(τ ) if there exists σ′ ∈ S, i < j ≤ n such that
σ′|∆{0,...,j−1} = σ|∆{0,...,j−1}, and σ|∆{j,...,m} is constant at the cone point of K ⊲. It is easy to check that
h′ has the desired properties.

It remains to prove that X ′ is weakly contractible. At this point, it is convenient to work in the setting
of semisimplicial sets: that is, we will ignore the degeneracy operations. Let X ′′ be the semisimplicial subset
of M(K ⊲) × ∆n spanned by those maps τ = (τ ′, τ ′′) : ∆m → M(K ⊲) × ∆n for which τ ′ = HomSet∆ (∆m, K ⊲)
(we observe that X ′′ is not stable under the degeneracy operators on M(K ⊲) × ∆n). Assumptions (i) and
(ii) guarantee that X ′′ ⊆ X ′. Moreover, the projection X → ∆n induces an isomorphism of semisimplicial
sets X ′′ → ∆n. Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that X ′′ is a deformation retract of X ′.

The proof now proceeds by a variation on our earlier construction. Namely, we will deﬁne a map of

semisimplicial sets

with the following properties:

g : M(K ⊲) × ∆n × ∆1 → M(K ⊲) × ∆n

(a) The map g carries X ′ × ∆1 into X ′ and X ′′ × ∆1 into X ′′.

(b) The restriction g|X ′ × {1} is the identity map.

(c) The restriction g| M(K ⊲) × ∆n × {0} factors through X ′.

As before, g is the product of a map g′ : M(K ⊲) × ∆1 → M(K ⊲) with the identity map on ∆n. To deﬁne g′,
we consider an arbitrary simplex τ : ∆m → M(K ⊲) × ∆1, corresponding to a subset S ⊆ HomSet∆ (∆m, K ⊲)
and a decomposition [m] = {0, . . . , i} ∪ {i + 1, . . . , m}. We let g′(τ ) ⊆ HomSet∆(∆m, K ⊲) = S ∪ S′, where S′
is the collection of all simplices σ : ∆m → K ⊲ such that σ|∆{i+1,...,m} is the constant map at the cone poine
of K ⊲. It is readily checked that g′ has the desired properties.

Lemma 5.5.9.13. Let K be a contractible Kan complex, and let X ⊆ M(K) × ∆n be a simplicial subset
with the following properties:

(i) The projection X → ∆n is surjective.

(ii) If τ = (τ ′, τ ′′) : ∆m → M(K) × ∆n belongs to X, and τ ′ ⊆ τ ′ as subsets of HomSet∆ (∆m, K), then

(τ ′, τ ′′) : ∆m → M(K) × ∆n belongs to X.

421

Then X is weakly contractible.

Proof. It will suﬃce to show that for every ﬁnite simplicial subset X ′ ⊆ X, the inclusion of X ′ into X is
weakly nullhomotopic. Enlarging X ′ if necessary, we may assume that X ′ = (M(K ′) × ∆n) ∩ X, where
K ′ is a ﬁnite simplicial subset of K. By further enlargement, we may suppose that the map X ′ → ∆n is
surjective. Since K is a contractible Kan complex, the inclusion K ′ ⊆ K extends to a map i : K ′⊲ → K.
Let X ⊆ M(K ′⊲) × ∆n denote the inverse image of X. Then the inclusion X ′ ⊆ X factors through X, and
Lemma 5.5.9.12 implies that X is weakly contractible.

Proof of Lemma 5.5.9.7. Fix an object C ∈ C. The simplicial set L(F)(C) can be described as follows:

(∗) For every n ≥ 1, every map f : C1 × . . . × Cn → C in C, and every collection of simplices {σi : ∆k →

F(Ci)}, there is a simplex f ({σi}) : ∆k → L(F)(C).

The simplices f ({σi}) satisfy relations which are determined by morphisms in the simplicial category Env(C).
To every k-simplex τ : ∆k → L(F)(D), we can associate a nonempty ﬁnite subset Sτ ⊆ HomSet∆(∆k, K).
If τ = f ({σi}), we assign the set of images of the simplices σi under the canonical maps F(Ci) → F(1) = K.
It is easy to see that Sτ is independent of the representation f ({σi}) chosen for τ , and depends functorially
on τ . Consequently, we obtain a map of simplicial sets L(F)(C) → M(K). Moreover, this map has the
following properties:

(i) The product map β′ : L(F)(C) → M(K) × L+(F)(C) is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

(ii) If a k-simplex τ = (τ ′, τ ′′) : ∆k → M(K) → L+(F)(C) belongs to the image of β, and τ ′ ⊆ τ ′ as ﬁnite
subsets of HomSet∆ (∆k, K), then (τ ′, τ ′′) : ∆k → M(K) × L+(F)(C) belongs to the image of β′.

We wish to show that β : L(F)(C) → L+(F)(C) is a weak homotopy equivalence. It will suﬃce to show
that for every simplex ∆k → L+(F)(C), the ﬁber product L(F)(C) ×L+(F)(C) ∆k is weakly contractible. In
view of (i), we can identify this ﬁber product with a simplicial subset X ⊆ ∆k × M(K). The surjectivity of β
and condition (ii) imply that X satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 5.5.9.13, so that X is weakly contractible
as desired.

The model category A appearing in Proposition 5.5.9.1 is very well suited to certain calculations, such as
the formation of homotopy colimits of simplicial objects. The following result provides a precise formulation
of this idea:

Proposition 5.5.9.14. Let C be a category which admits ﬁnite products, and A ⊆ SetC
∆, A ⊆ SetC the full
subcategories spanned by the product-preserving functors. Let F : ∆op → A be a simplicial object of A, which
we can identify with a bisimplicial object F : ∆op × ∆op → A. Composition with the diagonal

∆op → ∆op × ∆op F→ A

gives a simplicial object of A, which we can identify with an object | F | ∈ A. Then the homotopy colimit of
F is canonically isomorphic to | F | in the homotopy category hA.

The proof requires the following lemma:

Lemma 5.5.9.15. Let C be a category which admits ﬁnite products, and A ⊆ SetC
∆ be the full subcategory
spanned by the product preserving functors. For every object C ∈ C, the evaluation map A → Set∆ preserves
homotopy colimits of simplicial objects.

Proof. In view of Corollary 5.5.9.3 and Theorem 4.2.4.1, it will suﬃce to show that the evaluation functor
PΣ(N(C)op) → Set∆ preserves N(∆)op-indexed colimits. This follows from Proposition 5.5.8.10, since N(∆)op
is sifted (Lemma 5.5.8.4).

422

Proof of Proposition 5.5.9.14. Since A is a combinatorial simplicial model category, Corollary A.2.9.30 im-
plies the existence of a canonical map γ : hocolim F → | F | in the homotopy category hA; we wish to prove
that γ is an isomorphism. To prove this, it will suﬃce to show that the induced map γC : (hocolim F)(C) →
| F |(C) is an isomorphism in the homotopy category of simplicial sets, for each object C ∈ C. This map ﬁts
into a commutative diagram

hocolim(F(C))

γ′
C

| F(C)|

hocolim(F)(C)

/ | F |(C).

The left vertical map is an isomorphism in the homotopy category of simplicial sets by Lemma 5.5.9.15, the
right vertical map is evidently an isomorphism, and the map γ′
C is an isomorphism in the homotopy category
by Example A.2.9.31; it follows that γC is also an isomorphism, as desired.

Chapter 6

∞-Topoi

In this chapter, we come to the main subject of this book: the theory of ∞-topoi. Roughly speaking, an ∞-
topos is an ∞-category which “looks like” the ∞-category of spaces, just as an ordinary topos is a category
which “looks like” the category of sets. As in classical topos theory, there are various ways of making this
precise. We will begin in §6.1 by reviewing several possible deﬁnitions, and proving that they are equivalent
to one another.

The main result of §6.1 is Theorem 6.1.0.6, which asserts that an ∞-category X is an ∞-topos if and only
if X arises as an (accessible) left exact localization of an ∞-category of presheaves. In §6.2, we consider the
problem of constructing left exact localizations. In classical topos theory, there is a bijective correspondence
between left exact localizations of a presheaf category P(C) and Grothendieck topologies on C. In the ∞-
category categorical context, one can again use Grothendieck topologies to construct examples of left exact
localizations. Unfortunately, not every ∞-topos arises in this way. Nevertheless, the construction of an
∞-category of sheaves Shv(C) from a Grothendieck topology on C is an extremely useful construction, which
will play an important role throughout §7.

In order to understand higher topos theory, we will need to consider ∞-topoi not only individually, but
in relation to one another. In §6.3 we will introduce the notion of a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. The
collection of all ∞-topoi and geometric morphisms between them can be organized into an ∞-category RTop.
We will study the problem of constructing colimits and (certain) limits in RTop. In the course of doing so,
we will show that the class of ∞-topoi is stable under various categorical constructions.

One of our goals in this book is to apply ideas from higher category theory to study more classical
mathematical objects, such as topological spaces or ordinary topoi. In order to do so, it is convenient to
work in a setting where all of these objects can be considered on the same footing. In §6.4, we will introduce
the deﬁnition of an n-topos for all 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. When n = ∞, this will reduce to the theory introduced
in §6.1. The case n = 1 will recover classical topos theory, and the case n = 0 is almost equivalent to the
theory of topological spaces. We will study the theory of n-topoi, and introduce constructions which allow
us to pass between n-topoi and ∞-topoi. In particular, we associate an ∞-topos Shv(X) to every topological
space X, which will be the primary object of study in §7.

There are several diﬀerent ways of thinking about what an ∞-topos X is. On the one hand, we can view
X as a generalized topological space; on the other, we can think of X as an alternative universe in which
we can do homotopy theory. In §6.5, we will reinforce the second point of view by studying the internal
homotopy theory of an ∞-topos X. Just as in classical homotopy theory, one can deﬁne homotopy groups,
Postnikov towers, Eilenberg MacLane spaces, and so forth. In §7, we will bring together these two points
of view, by showing that classical geometric properties of a topological space X are reﬂected in internal
homotopy of the ∞-topos Shv(X) of sheaves on X.

There are several papers on higher topos theory in the literature. The papers [74] and [11] both discuss
a notion of 2-topos (the second from an elementary point of view). However, the basic model for these 2-
topoi is the 2-category of (small) categories, rather than the 2-category of (small) groupoids. Jardine ([41])

424

has exhibited a model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves on a Grothendieck site, and the
∞-category associated to this model category is an ∞-topos in our sense. This construction is generalized
from ordinary categories with a Grothendieck topology to simplicial categories with a Grothendieck topology
in [78] (and again produces ∞-topoi). However, not every ∞-topos arises in this way: one can construct
only ∞-topoi which are hypercomplete (called t-complete in [78]); we will summarize the situation in Section
6.5.2. Our notion of an ∞-topos is essentially equivalent to the notion of a Segal topos introduced in [78],
and to Charles Rezk’s notion of a model topos. We note also that the paper [78] has considerable overlap
with the ideas discussed here.

425

6.1 ∞-Topoi: Deﬁnitions and Characterizations

Before we study the ∞-categorical version of topos theory, it seems appropriate to brieﬂy review the classical
theory. Recall that a topos is a category C which behaves like the category of sets, or (more generally) the
category of sheaves of sets on a topological space. There are several (equivalent) ways of making this idea
precise. The following result is proved (in a slightly diﬀerent form) in [2]:

Proposition 6.1.0.1. Let C be a category. The following conditions are equivalent:

(A) The category C is (equivalent to) the category of sheaves of sets on some Grothendieck site.

(B) The category C is (equivalent to) a left-exact localization of the category of presheaves of sets on some

small category C0.

(C) Giraud’s axioms are satisﬁed:

(i) The category C is presentable (that is, C has small colimits and a set of small generators).
(ii) Colimits in C are universal.
(iii) Coproducts in C are disjoint.
(iv) Equivalence relations in C are eﬀective.

Deﬁnition 6.1.0.2. A category C is called a topos if it satisﬁes the equivalent conditions of Proposition
6.1.0.1.

Remark 6.1.0.3. A reader who is unfamiliar with some of the terminology used in the statement of Propo-
sition 6.1.0.1 should not worry: we will review the meaning of each condition in §6.1.1 as we search for
∞-categorical generalizations of axioms (i) through (iv).

Our goal in this section is to introduce the ∞-categorical analogue of Deﬁnition 6.1.0.2. Proposition

6.1.0.1 suggests several possible approaches. We begin with the simplest of these:

Deﬁnition 6.1.0.4. Let X be an ∞-category. We will say that X is an ∞-topos if there exists a small
∞-category C and an accessible left exact localization functor P(C) → X.

Remark 6.1.0.5. Deﬁnition 6.1.0.4 involves an accessibility condition which was not mentioned in Propo-
sition 6.1.0.1. This is because every left exact localization of a category of set-valued presheaves is auto-
matically accessible (see Proposition 6.4.3.9). We do not know if the corresponding result holds for S-valued
presheaves. However, it is true under a suitable hypercompleteness assumption: see [79].

Adopting Deﬁnition 6.1.0.4 amounts to selecting an extrinsic approach to higher topos theory: the class
of ∞-topoi is deﬁned to be the smallest collection of ∞-categories which contains S and is stable under
certain constructions (left exact localizations and the formation of functor categories). The main objective
of this section is to give several reformulations of Deﬁnition 6.1.0.2 which have a more intrinsic ﬂavor. Our
results may be summarized in the following statement (all our our terminology will be explained later in this
section):

Theorem 6.1.0.6. Let X be an ∞-category. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The ∞-category X is an ∞-topos.

(2) The ∞-category X is presentable, and for every small simplicial set K and every natural transformation

α : p → q of diagrams p, q : K ⊲ → X, the following condition is satisﬁed:

– If q is a colimit diagram and α = α|K is a Cartesian transformation, then p is a colimit diagram

if and only if α is a Cartesian transformation.

426

(3) The ∞-category X satisﬁes the following ∞-categorical analogues of Giraud’s axioms:

(i) The ∞-category X is presentable.
(ii) Colimits in X are universal.
(iii) Coproducts in X are disjoint.
(iv) Every groupoid object of X is eﬀective.

We will review the meanings of conditions (i) through (iv) in §6.1.1 and §6.1.2. In §6.1.3 we will give
several equivalent formulations of (2), and prove the implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3). The implication (3) ⇒ (1)
is the most diﬃcult; we will give the proof in §6.1.5 after establishing a crucial technical lemma in §6.1.4.
Finally, in §6.1.6 we will establish yet another characterization of ∞-topoi, based on the theory of classifying
objects.

Remark 6.1.0.7. The characterization of the class of ∞-topoi given by part (2) of Theorem 6.1.0.6 is due
to Rezk, as are many of the ideas presented in §6.1.3.

The equivalence (1) ⇔ (3) of Theorem 6.1.0.6 can be viewed as an ∞-categorical analogue of the equiv-
alence (B) ⇔ (C) in Proposition 6.1.0.1. It is natural to ask if there is also some equivalent of the charac-
terization (A). To put the question another way: given a small ∞-category C, does there exist some natural
description of the class of all left-exact localizations of C? Experience with classical topos theory suggests
that we might try to characterize such localizations in terms of Grothendieck topologies on C. We will in-
troduce a theory of Grothendieck topologies on ∞-categories in §6.2.2, and show that every Grothendieck
topology on C determines a left-exact localization of P(C). However, it turns out that not every ∞-topos
arises via this construction. This raises a natural question: is it possible to give an explicit description of all
left-exact localizations of P(C), perhaps in terms of some more reﬁned theory of Grothendieck topologies?
We will give a partial answer to this question in §6.5.

6.1.1 Giraud’s Axioms in the ∞-Categorical Setting

Our goal in this section is to formulate higher-categorical analogues of the conditions (i) through (iv) which
appear in Proposition 6.1.0.1. We consider each axiom in turn. In each case, our objective is to ﬁnd an
analogous axiom which makes sense in the setting of ∞-categories, and is satisﬁed by the ∞-category S of
spaces.

(i) The category C is presentable.

The generalization to the case where C is a ∞-category is obvious: we should merely require C to be a
presentable ∞-category in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.5.0.18. According to Example 5.5.1.8, this condition is
satisﬁed when C is the ∞-category of spaces.

(ii) Colimits in C are universal.

Let us ﬁrst recall the meaning of this condition in classical category theory. If the axiom (i) is satisﬁed,

then C is presentable and therefore admits all (small) limits and colimits. In particular, every diagram

has a limit XT = X ×S T . This construction determines a functor

X → S

f
← T

f ∗ : C/S → C/T

X 7→ XT ,

which is a right adjoint to the functor given by composition with f .

427

We say that colimits in C are universal if the functor f ∗ is colimit-preserving, for every map f : T → S
in C. (In other words, colimits are universal in C if any colimit in C remains a colimit in C after pulling back
along a morphism T → S.)

Let us now attempt to make this notion precise in the setting of an arbitrary ∞-category C. Let OC =
Fun(∆1, C), and let p : OC → C be given by evaluation at {1} ⊆ ∆1. Corollary 2.4.7.12 implies that p is a
coCartesian ﬁbration.

Lemma 6.1.1.1. Let X be an ∞-category and let p : OX → X be deﬁned as above. Let F be a morphism in
OX, corresponding to a diagram σ : ∆1 × ∆1 ≃ (Λ2

2)⊳ → X, which we will denote by

X ′

X

f ′

f

Y ′

g

/ Y

Then F is p-Cartesian if and only if the above diagram is a pullback in X. In particular, p is a Cartesian
ﬁbration if and only if the ∞-category X admits pullbacks.

Proof. For every simplicial set K, let K + denote the full simplicial subset of (K ⋆ {x} ⋆ {y}) × ∆1 spanned
by all of the vertices except (x, 0), and deﬁne a simplicial set C by setting

Fun(K, C) = {m : K + → X : m|({x} ⋆ {y}) × {1} = f, m|{y} × ∆1 = g}.

We observe that we have a commutative diagram

C

(OX)/g

X/f

/ X/Y ′

which induces a map q : C → (OX)/g ×X/Y ′ X/f . We ﬁrst claim that q is a trivial ﬁbration. Unwinding the
deﬁnitions, we observe that the right lifting property of q with respect to an inclusion ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n follows
from the extension property of X with respect to Λn+2
n+1, which follows in turn from our assumption that X is
an ∞-category.

The inclusion K + ⊆ K × ∆1 induces a projection q′ : (OX)/F → C which ﬁts into a pullback diagram

(OX)/F

C

g

X/σ

q′′

/ X/σ|Λ2

2

.

It follows that q′ is a right ﬁbration, and that q′ is trivial if σ is a pullback diagram. Conversely, we observe
that (Λ2
2)⊳ is a retract of (∆0)+, so that the map g is surjective on vertices. Consequently, if q′ is a trivial
ﬁbration, then the ﬁbers of q′′ are contractible, so that q′′ is a trivial ﬁbration (Lemma 2.1.3.4) and σ is a
pullback diagram.

By deﬁnition, F is p-Cartesian if and only if the composition

q ◦ q′ : (OX)/F → (OX)/g ×X/Y ′ X/f

is a trivial ﬁbration. Since q is a trivial ﬁbration and q′ is a right ﬁbration, this is also equivalent to the
assertion that q′ is a trivial ﬁbration (Lemma 2.1.3.4).

Now suppose that X is an ∞-category which admits pullbacks, so that the projection p : OX → X is both
a Cartesian ﬁbration and a coCartesian ﬁbration. Let f : S → T be a morphism in X. Taking the pullback of
p along the corresponding map ∆1 → X, we obtain a correspondence from p−1(S) = X/S to p−1(T ) = X/T ,
associated to a pair of adjoint functors

f! : X/S → X/T
f ∗ : X/T → X/S .
The functors f! and f ∗ are well-deﬁned up to homotopy (in fact, up to a contractible space of choices. We
may think of f! as the functor given by composition with f , and f ∗ as the functor given by pullback along
f (in view of Lemma 6.1.1.1).

We can now formulate the ∞-categorical analogue of (ii):

Deﬁnition 6.1.1.2. Let C be a presentable ∞-category. We will say that colimits in C are universal if, for
any morphism f : T → S in C, the associated pullback functor

preserves (small) colimits.

f ∗ : C/S → C/T

Assume that C is a presentable ∞-category, and let f : T → S be a morphism in C. By the adjoint
functor theorem, f ∗ : C/S → C/T preserves all colimits if and only if it has a right adjoint f∗. Since the
existence of adjoint functors can be tested inside the enriched homotopy category, this gives a convenient
criterion which allows us to test whether or not colimits in C are universal.

Remark 6.1.1.3. Let X be an ∞-category. The assumption that colimits in X are universal can be viewed
as a kind of distributive law. We have the following table of vague analogies:

Deﬁnition 6.1.1.2 has a reformulation in the language of classifying functors (§3.3.2):

Proposition 6.1.1.4. Let X be an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The ∞-category X is presentable, and colimits in X are universal.

(2) The Cartesian ﬁbration p : OX → X is classiﬁed by a functor Xop → PrL.

Proof. We can restate condition (2) as follows: each ﬁber X/U of p is presentable, and each of the pullback
functors f ∗ : X/V → X/U preserves small colimits. It is clear that (1) ⇒ (2), and that (2) implies that
colimits in X are universal. Since X admits ﬁnite limits, it has a ﬁnal object 1; condition (2) implies that
X ≃ X/1 is presentable, which proves (1).

429

(iii) Coproducts in C are disjoint.

If C is an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite coproducts, then we will say that coproducts in C are disjoint

if every coCartesian diagram

Y

is also Cartesian, provided that ∅ is an initial object of C. More informally, to say that coproducts are
`
disjoint is to say that the intersection of X and Y inside the union X

Y is empty.

We now come to the most subtle and interesting of Giraud’s axioms:
`

(iv) Every equivalence relation in C is eﬀective.

Recall that if X is an object in an (ordinary) category C, then an equivalence relation R on X is an object

of C equipped with a map p : R → X × X such that for any S, the induced map

HomC(S, R) → HomC(S, X) × HomC(S, X)

exhibits HomC(S, R) as an equivalence relation on HomC(S, X).

If C admits ﬁnite limits, then it is easy to construct equivalence relations in C: given any map X → Y
in C, the induced map X ×Y X → X × X is an equivalence relation on X. If the category C admits ﬁnite
colimits, then one can attempt to invert this process: given an equivalence relation R on X, one can form the
coequalizer of the two projections R → X to obtain an object which we will denote by X/R. In the category
of sets, one can recover R as the ﬁber product X ×X/R X. In general, this need not occur: one always has
R ⊆ X ×X/R X, but the inclusion may be strict (as subobjects of X × X). If equality holds, then R is said
to be an eﬀective equivalence relation, and the map X → X/R is said to be an eﬀective epimorphism.

Remark 6.1.1.5. Recall that a map f : X → Y in a category C is said to be a categorical epimorphism if
the natural map HomC(Y, Z) → HomC(X, Z) is injective for every object Z ∈ C, so that we may identify
HomC(Y, Z) with a subset of HomC(X, Z). To say that f is an eﬀective epimorphism is to say that we can
characterize this subset: it is the collection of all maps g : X → Z such that the diagram

X ×Y X

commutes (which is obviously a necessary condition for the indicated dotted arrow to exist).

Using the terminology introduced above, we can neatly summarize some of the fundamental properties

of the category of sets:

Fact 6.1.1.6. In the category of sets, every equivalence relation is eﬀective and the eﬀective epimorphisms
are precisely the surjective maps.

430

#

The ﬁrst assertion of Fact 6.1.1.6 remains valid in any topos, and according to the axiomatic point of

view it is one of the deﬁning features of a topos.

If C is a category with ﬁnite limits and colimits in which all equivalence relations are eﬀective, then we
obtain a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence relations on an object X and quotients of X (that
is, isomorphism classes of eﬀective epimorphisms X → Y ). This correspondence is extremely useful because
it allows us to make elementary descent arguments: one can deduce statements about quotients of X from
statements about X and about equivalence relations on X (which live over X). We would like to formulate
an ∞-categorical analogue of this condition which will allow us to make similar arguments.

In the ∞-category S of spaces, the situation is more complicated. The correct notion of surjection of
spaces X → Y is a map which induces a surjection on path components π0X → π0Y . However, in this case,
the (homotopy) ﬁber product R = X ×Y X does not give an equivalence relation on X, because the map
R → X × X is not necessarily injective in any reasonable sense. However, it does retain some of the pleasant
features of an equivalence relation: instead of transitivity, we have a coherently associative composition law
R ×X R → R (this is perhaps most familiar in the situation where X is a point:
in this case, R can be
identiﬁed with the based loop space of Y , which is endowed with a multiplication given by concatenation
of loops). In §6.1.2 we will make this idea precise, and deﬁne groupoid objects and eﬀective groupoid objects
in an arbitrary ∞-category. Granting these notions for the moment, we have a natural candidate for the
∞-categorical generalization of condition (iv):

(iv)′ Every groupoid object of C is eﬀective.

6.1.2 Groupoid Objects

Let C be a category which admits ﬁnite limits. A groupoid object of C is a functor F from C to the category
Cat of (small) groupoids, which has the following properties:

(1) There exists an object X0 ∈ C and a (functorial) identiﬁcation of HomC(C, X0) with the set of objects

in the groupoid F (C), for each C ∈ C.

(2) There exists an object X1 ∈ C and a (functorial) identiﬁcation of HomC(C, X1) with the set of mor-

phisms in groupoid F (C), for each C ∈ C.

Example 6.1.2.1. Let C be the category Set of sets. Then a groupoid object of C is simply a (small)
groupoid.

Giving a groupoid object of a category C is equivalent to giving a pair of objects X0 ∈ C (the “object
classiﬁer”) and X1 ∈ C (the “morphism classiﬁer”), together with a collection of maps which relate X0 to X1
and satisfy appropriate identities, which imitate the usual axiomatics of category theory. These identities
can be very eﬃciently encoded using the formalism of simplicial objects. For every n ≥ 0, let [n] denote the
category associated to the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , n}, and consider the functor Fn : C → Set deﬁned so
that

Fn(C) = HomCat([n], F (C)).

By assumption, F0 and F1 are representable by objects X0, X1 ∈ C. Since C is stable under ﬁnite limits, it
follows that

Fn = F1 ×F0 . . . ×F0 F1

is representable by an object Xn = X1 ×X0 . . . ×X0 X1. The objects Xn can be assembled into a simplicial
object X• of C. We can think of this construction as a generalization of the process which associates to every
groupoid D its nerve N(D) (a simplicial set). Moreover, as in the classical case, the association F 7→ X•
is fully faihtful. In other words, we can identify groupoid objects of C with the corresponding simplicial

431

objects. Of course, not every simplicial object X• of C arises via this construction. This is true if and only
if certain additional conditions are met: for instance, the diagram

d0

d0

X2

d2

X1

X1

d1

/ X0

must be Cartesian.

The purpose of this section is to generalize the notion of a groupoid object to the setting where C is an
∞-category. We begin by introducing the class of simplicial objects of C; we then deﬁne groupoid objects to
be simplicial objects which satisfy additional conditions.

Deﬁnition 6.1.2.2. Let ∆+ denote the category of ﬁnite (possibly empty) linearly ordered sets. A simplicial
object of an ∞-category C is a map of ∞-categories

An augmented simplicial object of C is a map

U• : N(∆)op → C .

U +

• : N(∆+)op → C .

We let C∆ denote the ∞-category Fun(N(∆)op, C); we will refer to C∆ as the ∞-category of simplicial
objects of C. Similarly, we will refer to Fun(N(∆+)op, C) as the ∞-category of augmented simplicial objects
of C and we will denote it by C∆+.

If U• is an (augmented) simplicial object of C and n ≥ 0 (n ≥ −1), we will write Un for the object

U ([n]) ∈ C.

Remark 6.1.2.3. In the case where C is the nerve of an ordinary category D, Deﬁnition 6.1.2.2 recovers
the usual notion of a simplicial object of D. More precisely, the ∞-category C∆ of simplicial objects of C is
naturally isomorphic to the nerve of the category of simplicial objects of D.

Lemma 6.1.2.4. Let f : X → Y be a map of simplicial sets. Suppose that:

(1) The map f induces a bijection X0 → Y0 on vertex sets.

(2) The simplicial set Y is a Kan complex.

(3) The map f has the right lifting property with respect to every horn inclusion Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, for n ≥ 2.

(4) The map f is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Then f is a trivial Kan ﬁbration.

Proof. In view of condition (4), it suﬃces to prove that f is a Kan ﬁbration. In other words, we must show
that p has the right lifting property with respect to every horn inclusion Λn
i ⊆ ∆n. If n > 1, this follows
from (3). We may therefore reduce to the case where n = 1; by symmetry, we may suppose that i = 0.

Let e : y → y′ be an edge of Y . Condition (1) implies that there is a (unique) pair of vertices x, x′ ∈ X0
with y = f (x), y′ = f (x′). Since f is a homotopy equivalence, there is a path p from x to x′ in the
topological space |X|, such that the induced path |f | ◦ p in |Y | is homotopic to e via a homotopy which
keeps the endpoints ﬁxed. By cellular approximation we may suppose that this path is contained in the
1-skeleton of |X|. Consequently, there is a positive integer k, a sequence of vertices {z0, . . . , zk} with z0 = x,
zk = x′ such each adjacent pair (zi, zi+1) is joined by an edge pi (running in either direction), such that p is
homotopic (relative to its boundary) to the path obtained by concatenating the edges pi. Using conditions
i ⊆ ∆n for each
(2) and (3), we note that X has the extension property with respect to the inclusion Λn

n ≥ 2. It follows that we may assume that pi runs from zi to zi+1: if it runs in the opposite direction, then
we can extend the map

(pi, s0zi, •) : Λ2

2 → X

to a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → X, and then replace pi by d2σ.

Without loss of generality, we may suppose that k > 0 is chosen as small as possible. We claim that

k = 1. Otherwise, choose an extension τ : ∆2 → X of the map

(p1, •, p0) : Λ2

1 → X.

We can then replace the initial segment

p0→ z1
by the edge d1(τ ) : z0 → z2 and obtain a shorter path from x to x′, contradicting the minimality of k.

p1→ z2

z0

The edges e and f (p0) are homotopic in Y relative to their endpoints. Using (3), we see that p0 is
homotopic (relative to its endpoints) to an edge e which satisﬁes f (e) = e. This completes the proof that f
is a Kan ﬁbration.

Notation 6.1.2.5. Let K be a simplicial set. We let ∆/K denote the category of simplices of K deﬁned in
§4.2.3. The objects of ∆/K are pairs (J, η) where J is an object of ∆ and η ∈ HomSet∆(∆J , K). A morphism
from (J, η) to (J ′, η′) is a commutative diagram

Equivalently, we can describe ∆/K as the ﬁber product ∆ ×Set∆(Set∆)/K.

If C is an ∞-category, U : N(∆)op → C is a simplicial object of C, and K is a simplicial set, then we let

U [K] denote the composite map

N(∆/K)op → N(∆)op → C .

Proposition 6.1.2.6. Let C be an ∞-category and U : N(∆)op → C a simplicial object of C. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(1) For every weak homotopy equivalence f : K → K ′ of simplicial sets which induces a bijection K0 → K ′
0

on vertices, the induced map C/U[K ′] → C/U[K] is a categorical equivalence.

(2) For every coﬁbration f : K → K ′ of simplicial sets which is a weak homotopy equivalence and bijective

on vertices, the induced map C/U[K ′] → C/U[K] is a categorical equivalence.

(2′) For every coﬁbration f : K → K ′ of simplicial sets which is a weak homotopy equivalence and bijective

on vertices, the induced map C/U[K ′] → C/U[K] is a trivial ﬁbration.

(3) For every n ≥ 2 and every 0 ≤ i ≤ n, the induced map C/U[∆n] → C/U[Λn

i ] is a categorical equivalence.

(3′) For every n ≥ 2 and every 0 ≤ i ≤ n, the induced map C/U[∆n] → C/U[Λn

i ] is a trivial ﬁbration.

(4) For every n ≥ 0 and every partition [n] = S ∪ S′ such that S ∩ S′ consists of a single element s, the

induced map C/U[∆n] → C/U[K] is a categorical equivalence, where K = ∆S

{s} ∆S′

⊆ ∆n.

(4′) For every n ≥ 0 and every partition [n] = S ∪ S′ such that S ∩ S′ consists of a single element s, the

induced map C/U[∆n] → C/U[K] is a trivial ﬁbration, where K = ∆S

is a pullback square in the ∞-category C.

Proof. The dual of Proposition 2.1.2.1 implies that any monomorphism K → K ′ of simplicial sets induces
a right ﬁbration C/U[K] → C/U[K]. By Corollary 2.4.4.6, a right ﬁbration is a trivial ﬁbration if and only if
it is a categorical equivalence. This proves that (2) ⇔ (2′), (3) ⇔ (3′), and (4) ⇔ (4′). The implications
(1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) are obvious.

We now prove that (3) implies (1). Let A denote the class of all morphisms f : K ′ → K which induce
a categorical equivalence C/U[K] → C/U[K ′]. Let A′ denote the class of all coﬁbrations which have the same
property; equivalently, A′ is the class of all coﬁbrations which induce a trivial ﬁbration C/U[K] → C/U[K ′].
From this characterization it is easy to see that A′ is weakly saturated. Let A′′ be the weakly saturated class
i ⊆ ∆n for n > 1. If we assume (3), then we have the inclusions
of morphisms generated by the inclusions Λn
A′′ ⊆ A′ ⊆ A.

Let f : K → K ′ be an arbitrary morphism of simplicial sets. By Proposition A.1.2.5, we can choose a
i ⊆ ∆n for
map h′ : K ′ → M ′ which belongs to A′′, where M ′ has the extension property with respect to Λn
n > 1 and is therefore a Kan complex. Applying Proposition A.1.2.5 again, we can construct a commutative
diagram

K

h

h′

/ M

g

/ M ′

where the horizontal maps belong to A′′ and g has the right lifting property with respect to every morphism
in A′′. If f is a weak homotopy equivalence which is bijective on vertices, then g has the same properties, so
that g is a trivial ﬁbration by Lemma 6.1.2.4. It follows that g has the right lifting property with respect to
the coﬁbration g ◦ h : K → M ′, so that g ◦ h is a retract of h and therefore belongs to A′′. Since g ◦ h = h′ ◦ f
and h′ belong to A′′ ⊆ A, it follows that f belongs to A.

It is clear that (1) ⇒ (4). We next prove that (4′) ⇒ (3). We must show that if n > 1, then every
i ⊆ ∆n belongs to the class A deﬁned above. The proof is by induction on n. Replacing i by

inclusion Λn
n − i if necessary, we may suppose that i < n. If (n, i) 6= (2, 0), we consider the composition

∆n−1

Here f belongs to A′ by the inductive hypothesis and f ′ ◦ f belongs to A′ by virtue of the assumption (4′);
therefore f ′ also belongs to A. If n = 2 and i = 0, then we observe that the inclusion Λ2
1 ⊆ ∆2 is of the form
∆S

⊆ ∆2, where S = {0, 1} and S′ = {0, 2}.

{s} ∆S′

To complete the proof, we show that (4) is equivalent to (4′′). Fix n ≥ 0, let S ∪ S′ = [n] be such that
`

S ∩ S′ = {s}, and let K = ∆S
objects [n], S, S′, and {s}. Let I ⊆ I′ be the full subcategory obtained by omitting the object [n]. Let p′

Condition (4) asserts that the upper horizontal map is a categorical equivalence, and condition (4′′) asserts

the vertical maps u and v are categorical equivalences.

Since ∆n is a ﬁnal object of both ∆/∆n and I′, the unlabelled maps are trivial ﬁbrations. It follows that u
is a categorical equivalence.

To prove that v is a categorical equivalence, it suﬃces to show that the inclusion g : I ⊆ ∆/K induces a

right anodyne map

N(g) : N(I) ⊆ N(∆/K)

of simplicial sets. We observe that the functor g has a left adjoint f , which associates to each simplex
σ : ∆m → K the smallest simplex in I which contains the image of σ. The map N(g) is a section of N(f ),
and there is a (ﬁberwise) simplicial homotopy from idN(∆/K) to N(g) ◦ N(f ). We now invoke Proposition
2.1.2.11 to deduce that N(g) is right anodyne, as desired.

Deﬁnition 6.1.2.7. Let C be an ∞-category. We will often denote simplicial objects of C by U•, and write
Un for U•([n]) ∈ C. We will say that a simplicial object U• ∈ C∆ is a groupoid object of C if it satisﬁes the
equivalent conditions of Proposition 6.1.2.6. We will let Gpd(C) denote the full subcategory of C∆ spanned
by the groupoid objects of C.

Remark 6.1.2.8. It follows from the proof of Proposition 6.1.2.6 that to verify that a simplicial object
X• ∈ C∆ is a groupoid object, we need only verify condition (4′′) in a small class of speciﬁc examples, but
we will not need this observation.

Proposition 6.1.2.9. Let C be a presentable ∞-category. The full subcategory Gpd(C) ⊆ C∆ is strongly
reﬂective.

Proof. Let n ≥ 0 and [n] = S ∪ S′ be as in the statement of (4′′) of Proposition 6.1.2.6. Let D(S, S′) ⊆ C∆
be the full subcategory consisting of those simplicial objects U ∈ C∆ for which the associated diagram

U ([n])

U (S)

U (S′)

/ U ({s})

is Cartesian. Lemmas 5.5.4.19 and 5.5.4.17 imply that D(S, S′) is a strongly reﬂective subcategory of C∆.
Let D denote the intersection of all these subcategories, taken over all n ≥ 0 and all such decompositions
[n] = S ∪ S′. Lemma 5.5.4.18 implies that D ⊆ C∆ is strongly reﬂective, and Proposition 6.1.2.6 implies that
D = Gpd(C).

Our next step is to exhibit a large class of examples of groupoid objects. We ﬁrst sketch the idea. Suppose
that C is an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits, and let u : U → X be a morphism in C. Using this data,
we can construct a simplicial object U• of C, where Un is given by the (n + 1)-fold ﬁber power of U over X.
In order to describe this construction more precisely, we need to introduce a bit of notation.

Notation 6.1.2.10. Let ∆≤n

+ denote the full subcategory of ∆+ spanned by the objects {[k]}−1≤k≤n.

Proposition 6.1.2.11. Let C be an ∞-category, and let U +
object of C. The following conditions are equivalent:

• : N(∆+)op → C be an augmented simplicial

(1) The augmented simplicial object U +

• is a right Kan extension of U +

• | N(∆≤0

+ )op.

(2) The underlying simplicial object U• is a groupoid object of C, and the diagram U +

• | N(∆≤1

+ )op is a

pullback square

in the ∞-category C.

U1

U0

U0

/ U−1

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. It follows immediately from the deﬁnition of right Kan extensions
that the diagram

U1

U0

U0

/ U−1

is a pullback. To prove that U• is a groupoid, we show that U• satisﬁes criterion (4′′) of Proposition 6.1.2.6.
Let S and S′ be sets with union [n] and intersection S ∩ S′ = {s}. Let I be the nerve of the category
(∆+)/∆n . For each subset J ⊆ [n], let I(J) denote the full subcategory of I spanned by the initial object
together with the inclusions {j} → ∆n, j ∈ S. By assumption, U +
• | N(I(S)),
U•(S′) as a limit of U +
• | N(I({s})).
It follows from Corollary 4.2.3.10 that the diagram

• | N(I([n])), and U•({s}) as a limit of U +

• | N(I(S′)), U•([n]) as a limit of U +

• exhibits U•(S) as a limit of U +

U•([n])

U•(S)

U•(S′)

/ U•({s})

is a pullback.

We now prove that (2) implies (1). Using the above notation, we must show that for each n ≥ −1,
• | I([n]). For n ≤ 0, this is obvious; for n = 1 it is equivalent to the

• ([n]) as a limit of U +

U +
• exhibits U +
assumption that

U1

is a pullback diagram. We prove the general case by induction on n. Using the inductive hypothesis,
we conclude that U•(∆S) is a limit of U +
• | I(S) for all proper subsets S ⊂ [n]. Choose a decomposition

to the assertion that

U•([n])

U•(S)

U•(S′)

is a pullback diagram, which follows from our assumption that U• is a groupoid object of C.

We will say that augmented simplicial object U +

equivalent conditions of Proposition 6.1.2.11. In this case, U +
• is the ˇCech nerve of u.
u : U0 → U−1; we will also say that U +

• in an ∞-category C is a ˇCech nerve if it satisﬁes the
• is determined up to equivalence by the map

Notation 6.1.2.12. Let U• be a simplicial object in an ∞-category C. We may regard U• as a diagram in
C indexed by N(∆)op. We let |U•| : N(∆+)op → C denote a colimit for U• (if such a colimit exists). We will
refer to any such colimit as a geometric realization of U•.

Remark 6.1.2.13. Note that we are regarding |U•| as a colimit diagram in C, not as an object of C. We
also note that our notation is somewhat abusive, since |U•| is not uniquely determined by U•. However, if a
colimit of U• exists, then it is determined up to contractible ambiguity.

Deﬁnition 6.1.2.14. Let U• be a simplicial object of an ∞-category C. We will say that U• is an eﬀective
groupoid if can be extended to a colimit diagram U +

• : N(∆+)op → C such that U +

• is a ˇCech nerve.

Remark 6.1.2.15. It follows immediately from characterization (3) of Proposition 6.1.2.11 that any eﬀective
groupoid U• is a groupoid.

We can now state the ∞-categorical counterpart of Fact 6.1.1.6: every groupoid object in S is eﬀective.
This statement is somewhat less trivial than its classical analogue. For example, a groupoid object U• in S
with U0 = ∗ can be thought of as a space U1 equipped with a coherently associative multiplication operation.
If U• is eﬀective, then there exists a ﬁber diagram

U1

so that U1 is homotopy equivalent to a loop space. This is an classical result (see, for example, [73]). We
will give a somewhat indirect proof in the next section.

6.1.3 ∞-Topoi and Descent

In this section, we will describe an elegant characterization of the notion of an ∞-topos, based on the theory
of descent. We begin by explaining the idea in informal terms. Let X be an ∞-category. To each object
U of X we can associate the overcategory X/U .
If X admits ﬁnite limits, then this construction gives a
Cat∞ of (not necessarily small) ∞-categories. If X is an
contravariant functor from X to the ∞-category
∞-topos, then this functor carries colimits in X to limits of ∞-categories.
In other words, if an object
X ∈ X is obtained as the colimit of some diagram {Xα} in X, then giving a morphism Y → X is equivalent
to a suitably compatible diagram of morphisms {Yα → Xα}. Moreover, we will eventually show that this
property characterizes the class of ∞-topoi. The ideas presented in this section are due to Charles Rezk.

Deﬁnition 6.1.3.1. Let X be an ∞-category, K a simplicial set, and p, q : K → X two diagrams. We will
say that a natural transformation α : p → q is Cartesian if, for each edge φ : x → y in K, the associated

Lemma 6.1.3.2. Let X be an ∞-category, and let α : p → q be a natural transformation of diagrams
p, q : K ⋄ ∆0 → X. Suppose that, for every vertex x of K, the associated transformation

is Cartesian. Then α is Cartesian.

p|{x} ⋄ ∆0 → q|{x} ⋄ ∆0

Proof. Let z be the “cone point” of K ⋄ ∆0. We note that to every edge e : x → y in K ⋄ ∆0 we can associate
a diagram

/ z.

The transformation α restricts to a Cartesian transformation on the horizontal edges and the right vertical
edge, either by assumption or because they are degenerate. Applying Lemma 4.4.2.1, we deduce ﬁrst that
α(g) is a Cartesian transformation, then that α(e) is a Cartesian transformation.

The condition that an ∞-category has universal colimits can be formulated in the language of Cartesian

transformations:

Lemma 6.1.3.3. Let X be a presentable ∞-category. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) Colimits in X are universal.

(2) Let p, q : (K ⊲ ⋄ ∆0) → X be diagrams which carry ∆0 to vertices X, Y ∈ X, and let α : p → q be a
Cartesian transformation. If the map q′ : K ⊲ → X/Y associated to q is a colimit diagram, then the
map p′ : K ⊲ → X/X associated to p is a colimit diagram.

(3) Let p, q : K ⋆ ∆1 → X be diagrams which carry {1} to vertices X, Y ∈ X, and let α : p → q be a
Cartesian transformation. If the map K ⊲ → X/Y associated to q is a colimit diagram, then the map
K ⊲ → X/X associated to p is a colimit diagram.

(4) Let p, q : K ⋆ ∆1 → X be diagrams which carry {1} to vertices X, Y ∈ X, and let α : p → q be a
Cartesian transformation. If q|K ⋆ {0} is a colimit diagram, then p|K ⋆ {0} is a colimit diagram.

(5) Let α : p → q be a Cartesian transformation of diagrams K ⊲ → X. If q is a colimit diagram, then p is

a colimit diagram.

Proof. Assume that (1) is satisﬁed; we will prove (2). The transformation α induces a map f : X → Y .
Consider the map

φ : Fun(K ⊲, OX) → Fun(K ⊲, X)

given by evaluation at the ﬁnal vertex of ∆1. Let δ(f ) denote the image of f under the diagonal map
δ : X → Fun(K ⊲, X). Then we may identify α with an edge e of Fun(K ⊲, OX) which covers δ(f ). Since
α is Cartesian, we can apply Lemma 6.1.1.1 and Proposition 3.1.2.1 to deduce that e is φ-Cartesian. The
composition f ∗ ◦ q′ is the origin of a φ-Cartesian edge e′ : f ∗ ◦ q′ → q′ of Fun(K ⊲, OX) covering δ(f ), so we

conclude that f ∗ ◦ q′ and p′ are equivalent in Fun(K ⊲, X/X ). Since q′ is a colimit diagram and f ∗ preserves
colimits, f ∗ ◦ q′ is a colimit diagram. It follows that p′ is a colimit diagram, as desired.

We now prove that (2) ⇒ (1). Let f : X → Y be a morphism in X, and let q′ : K ⊲ → X/Y be a colimit
diagram. Choose a φ-Cartesian edge e′ : f ∗ ◦ q′ → q′ as above, corresponding to a natural transformation
α : p → q of diagrams p, q : (K ⊲ ⋄ ∆0) → X. Since e is φ-Cartesian, we may invoke Proposition 3.1.2.1 and
Lemma 6.1.1.1 to deduce that α restricts to a Cartesian transformation p|({x} ⋄ ∆0) → q|({x} ⋄ ∆0) for every
vertex x of K ⊲. It follows from Lemma 6.1.3.2 that α is Cartesian. Invoking (2), we conclude that f ∗ ◦ q′ is
a colimit diagram, as desired.

The equivalence (2) ⇔ (3) follows from Proposition 4.2.1.2, and the equivalence (3) ⇔ (4) follows from
Proposition 1.2.13.8. The implication (5) ⇒ (4) is obvious. The converse implication (4) ⇒ (5) follows from
the observation that K ⋆ {0} is a retract of K ⋆ ∆1.

Notation 6.1.3.4. Let X be an ∞-category which admits pullbacks, and let S be a class of morphisms in
X. We will say that S is stable under pullback if for any pullback diagram

diagrams as above. We observe that evaluation at {1} ⊆ ∆1 induces a Cartesian ﬁbration OS
restricts to a right ﬁbration O(S)

X denote the full subcategory of OX spanned by
X the subcategory of OX whose objects are are elements of S, and whose morphisms are pullback
X → X, which

X → X (Corollary 2.4.2.5).

Lemma 6.1.3.5. Let X be a presentable ∞-category, and suppose that colimits in X are universal. Let S be
a class of morphisms of X which is stable under pullback, K a small simplicial set, and q : K ⊲ → X a colimit
diagram. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The composition f ◦ q : K ⊲ →

(3) For every natural transformation α : p → q of colimit diagrams K ⊲ → X, if α = α|K is a Cartesian
transformation and α(x) ∈ S for each vertex x ∈ K, then α is a Cartesian transformation and
α(∞) ∈ S, where ∞ denotes the cone point of K ⊲.

Proof. Let C = Fun(K ⊲, X)/q and C = Fun(K, X)/q. Let C0
denote the full subcategory of C spanned by
Cartesian natural tranformations α : p → q with the property that α(x) belongs to S for each vertex x ∈ K ⊲,
and let C0 be deﬁned similarly. Finally, let C1
denote the full subcategory of C spanned by those natural
transformations α : p → q such that p is a colimit diagram, α = α|K is a Cartesian transformation, and
α(x) belongs to S for each vertex x ∈ K. Lemma 6.1.3.3 implies that C0

⊆ C1

.

Let D denote the full subcategory of Fun(K ⊲, C) spanned by the colimit diagrams. Proposition 4.3.2.15
asserts that the restriction map D → Fun(K, C) is a trivial ﬁbration. It follows that the associated map
D/q → Fun(K, C)/q is also a trivial ﬁbration, and therefore restricts to a trivial ﬁbration C1

→ C0.

According to Proposition 3.3.3.1, condition (1) is equivalent to the assertion that the projection C0
→ C0
is an equivalence of ∞-categories. In view of the above argument, this is equivalent to the assertion that the
fully faithful inclusion C0
⊆ C1
is clearly stable under equivalence in C, (1)
holds if and only if C0

Lemma 6.1.3.6. Let X be a presentable category in which colimits are universal. Let f : X → ∅ be a
morphism in X, where ∅ is an initial object of X. Then X is also initial.
Proof. Observe that id∅ is both an initial object of X/∅ (Proposition 1.2.13.8) and a ﬁnal object of X/∅. Let
f ∗ : X/∅ → X/X be a pullback functor. Then f ∗ preserves limits (since it is a right adjoint) and colimits (since
colimits in X are universal). Therefore f ∗ id∅ is both initial and ﬁnal in X/X . It follows that idX : X → X,
being another ﬁnal object of X/X , is also initial. Applying Proposition 1.2.13.8, we deduce that X is an
initial object of X, as desired.

Lemma 6.1.3.7. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal, and let S be a class of
morphisms in X which is stable under pullback. The following conditions are equivalent:

Proof. The equivalence of (1) and (2) follows easily from Lemma 6.1.3.5. Let s : X →
∞ be a functor
which classiﬁes OX. Then (1) is equivalent to the assertion that s preserves small colimits. Supposing that
(1) is satisﬁed, we deduce (3) by applying Lemma 6.1.3.5 in the special cases of sums and coproducts. For
the converse, let us suppose that (3) is satisﬁed. Let ∅ denote an initial object of X. Since colimits in X
are universal, Lemma 6.1.3.6 implies that X/∅ is equivalent to ﬁnal ∞-category ∆0. Since the morphism id∅
belongs to S (since S is stable under empty coproducts), we conclude that s(∅) is a ﬁnal ∞-category, so that
s preserves initial objects. It follows from Corollary 4.4.2.5 that s preserves ﬁnite coproducts. According
to Proposition 4.4.2.6, it will suﬃce to prove that s preserves arbitrary coproducts. To handle the case of
inﬁnite coproducts we apply Lemma 6.1.3.5 again: we must show that if {fα}α∈A is a collection of elements of
S having a coproduct f =
α∈A fα, then f ∈ S and each of the maps fα → f is a Cartesian transformation.
The ﬁrst condition is true by assumption; for the second we let f ′ be a coproduct of the family {fβ}β∈A,β6=α,
so that f ≃ f ′
fα and f ′ ∈ S. Applying Lemma 6.1.3.5 (and the fact that s preserves ﬁnite coproducts),
we deduce that fα → f is a Cartesian transformation as desired.

Deﬁnition 6.1.3.8. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal, and let S be a class
of morphisms in X. We will say that S is local if it is stable under pullbacks and satisﬁes the equivalent
conditions of Lemma 6.1.3.7.

in OX, if α and β are Cartesian transformations, then α′ and β′ are also Cartesian transformations.

(2) Colimits in X are universal, and the class of all morphisms in X is local.

(3) The Cartesian ﬁbration OX → X is classiﬁed by a limit-preserving functor Xop → PrL.

(4) Let K be a small simplicial set and α : p → q a natural transformation of diagrams p, q : K ⊲ → X.
Suppose that q is a colimit diagram, and that α = α|K is a Cartesian transformation. Then p is a
colimit diagram if and only if α is a Cartesian transformation.

Proof. The equivalences (1) ⇔ (2) ⇔ (3) follow from Lemma 6.1.3.7 and Proposition 6.1.1.4. The equivalence
(3) ⇔ (4) follows from Lemmas 6.1.3.3 and 6.1.3.5.

We now have most of the tools required to establish the implication (1) ⇒ (2) of Theorem 6.1.0.6. In

view of Theorem 6.1.3.9, it will suﬃce to prove the following:

Proposition 6.1.3.10. Let X be an ∞-topos. Then:

(1) Colimits in X are universal.

(2) For every pushout diagram

f

in OX, if α and β are Cartesian transformations, then α′ and β′ are also Cartesian transformations.

Remark 6.1.3.11. Once we have established Theorem 6.1.0.6 in its entirety, it will follow from Theorem
6.1.3.9 that the converse of Proposition 6.1.3.10 is also valid: a presentable ∞-category X is an ∞-topos if
and only if it satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2) as above. Condition (1) is equivalent to the requirement that
for every morphism f : X → Y in X, the pullback functor f ∗ : X/Y → X/X has a right adjoint (in the case
where Y is a ﬁnal object of X, this simply amounts to the requirement that every object Z ∈ X admits an
exponential Z X ; in other words, the requirement that X be Cartesian closed), and condition (2) involves
only ﬁnite diagrams in the ∞-category X. One could conceivably obtain a theory of elementary ∞-topoi by
dropping the requirement that X be presentable (or replacing it by weaker conditions which are also ﬁnite
in nature). We will not pursue this idea further.

Before giving the proof of Proposition 6.1.3.10, we need to establish a few easy lemmas.

Lemma 6.1.3.12. Let

φ

q

φ′

p

ψ

q′

/ ψ′

be a coCartesian square in the category of arrows of Set∆. Suppose that p and q are homotopy Cartesian
and that q is a coﬁbration. Then:

(1) The maps p′ and q′ are homotopy Cartesian.

(2) Given any map of arrows r : ψ′ → θ such that r ◦ p′ and r ◦ q′ are homotopy Cartesian, the map r is

itself homotopy Cartesian.

Proof. Let r : ψ′ → θ be as in (2). We must show that r is homotopy Cartesian if and only if r ◦ p′ and r ◦ q′
are homotopy Cartesian (taking r = idψ′, we will deduce (1)). Without loss of generality, we may replace φ,
ψ, φ′ and θ with minimal Kan ﬁbrations. We now observe that r, r ◦ p′, and r ◦ q′ are homotopy Cartesian
if and only if they are Cartesian; the desired result now follows immediately.

Lemma 6.1.3.13. Let A be a simplicial model category containing an object Z which is both ﬁbrant and
coﬁbrant, and let A/Z be endowed with the induced model structure. Then the natural map θ : N(A◦
/Z ) →
N(A◦)/Z is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Proof. Let φ : Z ′ → Z be an object of N(A◦)/Z . Then we can choose a factorization

Z ′

i→ Z ′′ ψ

→ Z

where i is a trivial coﬁbration and ψ is a ﬁbration, corresponding to a ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object of A/Z . The
above diagram classiﬁes an equivalence between φ and ψ in N(A◦)/Z , so that θ is essentially surjective.

Recall that for any simplicial category C containing a pair of objects X and Y , there is a natural

isomorphism of simplicial sets

HomR

N(C)(X, Y ) ≃ SingQ• (MapC(X, Y )),

where Q• is the cosimplicial object of Set∆ introduced in §2.2.2. The same calculation shows that if φ : X →
Z, ψ : Y → Z are two morphisms in C, then

HomR

N(C)/Z

(φ, ψ) ≃ SingQ• (P ),

where P denotes the path space

MapC(X, Y ) ×MapC(X,Z){0} MapC(X, Z)∆1

×MapC(X,Z){1} {φ}.

If C is ﬁbrant, then we may identify M with the homotopy ﬁber of the map

over the vertex φ. Consequently, we may identify the natural map

f : MapC(X, Y )

ψ
→ MapC(X, Z)

HomR

N(C/Z )(φ, ψ) → HomR

N(C)/Z

(φ, ψ)

with SingQ• (θ), where θ denotes the inclusion of the ﬁber of f into the homotopy ﬁber of f . Consequently, to
show that SingQ• (θ) is a homotopy equivalence, it suﬃces to prove that f is a Kan ﬁbration. In the special
case where C = A◦ and ψ is a ﬁbration, this follows from the deﬁnition of a simplicial model category.

Lemma 6.1.3.13 asserts that ψ and φ′ ◦ φ are categorical equivalences, and φ′ is a trivial ﬁbration. It follows
that φ is also a categorical equivalence. Consequently, it will suﬃce to show that the functor F has a right
adjoint G which preserves colimits.

We observe that F is obtained by restricting the simplicial nerve of the functor f! : (Set∆)/X → (Set∆)/Y ,
it has a right adjoint f ∗, given by
given by composition with f . The functor f! is a left Quillen functor:
the formula f ∗(Y ′) = Y ′ ×Y X. According to Proposition 5.2.4.6, F admits a right adjoint G, which is
given by the restricting the simplicial nerve of the functor f ∗. To prove that G preserves colimits, it will
suﬃce to show that G itself admits a right adjoint. Using Proposition 5.2.4.6 again, we are reduced to
proving that f ∗ is a left Quillen functor. We observe that f ∗ admits a right adjoint f∗, given by the formula
f∗(X ′) = MapY (X, X ′). It is clear that f ∗ preserves coﬁbrations; it also preserves weak equivalences, since
f is a ﬁbration and Set∆ is a right proper model category (with its usual model structure).

To prove (2), we ﬁrst apply Proposition 4.2.4.4 to reduce to the case where the pushout diagram in

question arises from a strictly commutative square

4.2.4.1.

Lemma 6.1.3.15. Let X be a presentable ∞-category, and let L : X → Y be an accessible left exact localiza-
tion. If colimits in X are universal, then colimits in Y are universal.

Proof. We will use characterization (5) of Lemma 6.1.3.2. Let G be a right adjoint to L, and let α : p → q be
a Cartesian transformation of diagrams K ⊲ → Y. Suppose that q is a colimit of q = q|K. Choose a colimit
q′ of G ◦ q, so that there exists a morphism q′ → G ◦ q in XG◦q/ which determines a natural transformation

. Since G is left exact, G ◦ α is a Cartesian transformation. It follows that α′, being a pullback of
G ◦ α, is also a Cartesian transformation. Since colimits in X are universal, we conclude that p′ is a colimit
diagram. Since L is left exact, we obtain a pullback diagram

L ◦ p′

L ◦ q′

L◦β

L ◦ G ◦ p

/ L ◦ G ◦ q.

Since L preserves colimits, L ◦ q′ and L ◦ p′ are colimit diagrams. The diagram L ◦ G ◦ q is equivalent to
q, and therefore also a colimit diagram. We deduce that L ◦ β is an equivalence. Since the diagram is a
pullback, the left vertical arrow is an equivalence as well, so that L ◦ G ◦ p is a colimit diagram. We ﬁnally
conclude that p is a colimit diagram, as desired.

We are now ready to give the proof of Proposition 6.1.3.10.

Proof of Proposition 6.1.3.10. Let us say that a presentable ∞-category X is good if it satisﬁes conditions (1)
and (2). Lemma 6.1.3.14 asserts that S is good. Using Proposition 5.1.2.2, it is easy to see that if X is good
then so is Fun(K, X), for every small simplicial set K. It follows that every ∞-category P(C) of presheaves
is good. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that if X is good and L : X → Y is an accessible left
exact localization functor, then Y is good. Lemma 6.1.3.15 shows that colimits in Y are universal. Consider
a diagram σ : Λ2

0 → OY, denoted by

g α← f

β
→ h

where α and β are Cartesian transformations. We wish to show that if σ is a colimit of σ in OY, then σ
carries each edge to a Cartesian transformation. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that σ = L ◦ σ′
for some σ′ : Λ2
0 → OX which is equivalent to G ◦ σ. Since G is left exact, G(α) and G(β) are Cartesian
transformations. Because X satisﬁes (2), there exists a colimit σ′ of σ′ which carries each edge to a Cartesian
transformation. Then L ◦ σ′ is a colimit of σ. Since L is left exact, L ◦ σ′ carries each edge to a Cartesian
transformation in OY.

Our ﬁnal objective in this section is to prove the implication (2) ⇒ (3) of Theorem 6.1.0.6 (Proposition

6.1.3.19 below).

• : N(∆+)op → X an augmented simplicial object of X.
Lemma 6.1.3.16. Let X be an ∞-category and U +
Let ∆∞ denote the category whose objects are ﬁnite, linearly ordered sets J, where Hom∆∞ (J, J ′) is the
collection of all order-preserving maps J ∪ {∞} → J ′ ∪ {∞} which carry ∞ to ∞ (here ∞ is regarded as
a maximal element of J ∪ {∞} and J ′ ∪ {∞}). Suppose that U +
• extends to a functor F : N(∆∞)op → X.
Then U +

• is a colimit diagram in X.

Proof. Let C denote the category whose objects are triples (J, J+), where J is a ﬁnite, linearly ordered set,
and J+ is an upward-closed subset of J. We deﬁne HomC((J, J+), (J ′, J ′
+) to be the set of all order-preserving
maps from J into J ′ that carry J+ into J ′

+. Observe that we have a functor C → ∆∞, given by

Let F ′ denote the composite functor

(J, J+) 7→ J − J+.

N(C)op → N(∆∞)op → X .

Let C be the full subcategory of C spanned by those pairs (J, J+) where J 6= ∅. Let C0

denote the

Our ﬁrst claim is that the inclusion N(C0)op ⊆ N(C)op is coﬁnal. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it will
suﬃce to show that for every object X = (J, J+) of C, the category C0
/X has a contractible nerve. This is
clear, since the relevant category has a ﬁnal object: namely, the map (J, ∅) → (J, J+). As a consequence, we
conclude that U +

• is a colimit diagram if and only if F ′ is a colimit diagram.

We now deﬁne C1 to be the full subcategory of C spanned by those pairs (J, J+) such that J+ is nonempty.
We claim that F ′| N(C)op is a left Kan extension of F ′| N(C1)op. To prove this, we must show that for every
(J, ∅) ∈ C0, the induced map

(N(C1

(J,∅)/)op)⊲ → N(C)op → X

is a colimit diagram. Let D denote the full subcategory of C1
(J,∅)/ spanned by those morphisms (J, ∅) →
(J ′, J ′
(J,∅)/)op is
coﬁnal. To prove this, we once again invoke Theorem 4.1.3.1, to reduce to the following assertion: for every
morphism φ : (J, ∅) → (J ′′, J ′′

+. We claim that the inclusion N(D)op ⊆ N(C1

+)

+ ), where J ′′′

+ = {j ∈ J ′′

+, has weakly contractible nerve. This is clear, since D/φ has a ﬁnal object
+ : (∀i ∈ J)[j ≥ φ(i)]}. Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that the

N(Dop)⊲ → X

is a colimit diagram. This diagram can be identiﬁed with the constant diagram

N(∆+)op → X

taking the value U•(J), and is a colimit diagram because the category ∆ has weakly contractible nerve
(Corollary 4.4.4.10).

We now apply Lemma 4.3.2.7, which asserts that F ′ is a colimit diagram if and only if F ′|(N(C1)op)⊲ is
a colimit diagram. Let C2 ⊆ C1 be the full subcategory spanned by those objects (J, J+) such that J = J+.
We claim that the inclusion N(C2)op ⊆ N(C1)op is coﬁnal. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it will suﬃce to
show that, for every object (J, J+) ∈ C1, the category C2
/(J,J+) has weakly contractible nerve. This is clear,
since the map (J+, J+) → (J, J+) is a ﬁnal object of the category C(2)
/(J,J+). Consequently, to prove that
F ′|(N(C1)op)⊲ is a colimit diagram, it will suﬃce to prove that F ′|(N(C2)op)⊲ is a colimit diagram. But this
diagram can be identiﬁed with the constant map N(∆+)op → X taking the value U•(∆−1), which is a colimit
diagram because the simplicial set N(∆)op is weakly contractible (Corollary 4.4.4.10).

Lemma 6.1.3.17. Let X be an ∞-category, and let U• : N(∆)op → X be a simplicial object of X. Let U ′
the augmented simplicial object given by composing U• with the functor

445

Proof. Assertion (1) follows immediately from Lemma 6.1.3.16. To prove (2), let us consider the collection
S of all morphisms f : J → J ′ in ∆ such that α(f ) is a pullback square

U ′

in X. We wish to prove that every morphism of ∆ belongs to S. Using Lemma 4.4.2.1, we deduce that if
f ′ ∈ S, then f ∈ S ⇔ (f ◦ f ′ ∈ S). Consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that every inclusion {j} ⊆ J belongs
to S. Unwinding the deﬁnition, this amounts the the requirement that the diagram

U•(J ∪ {∞})

/ U•(J)

U•({j, ∞})

/ U•({j})

is Cartesian, which follows immediately from Criterion (4′′) of Proposition 6.1.2.6.

Remark 6.1.3.18. Assertion (2) of Lemma 6.1.3.17 has a converse: if α is a Cartesian transformation, then
U• is a groupoid object of X. This can be deduced easily by examining the proof of Proposition 6.1.2.6, but
we will not have need of it.

Proposition 6.1.3.19. Let X be an ∞-category satisfying the equivalent conditions of Theorem 6.1.3.9.
Then X satisﬁes the ∞-categorical Giraud axioms:

(i) The ∞-category X is presentable.

(ii) Colimits in X are universal.

(iii) Coproducts in X are disjoint.

(iv) Every groupoid object of X is eﬀective.

Proof. Axioms (i) and (ii) are obvious. To prove (iii), let us consider an arbitrary pair of objects X, Y ∈ X,
and let ∅ denote an initial object of X. Let f : ∅ → X be a morphism (unique up to homotopy, since ∅ is
initial). We observe that id∅ is an initial object of OX. Form a pushout diagram

can be identiﬁed with a pushout diagram

transformation. In particular, we conclude that

Corollary 6.1.3.20. Every groupoid object of S is eﬀective.

6.1.4 Free Groupoids

Let X be an ∞-category which satisﬁes the ∞-categorical Giraud axioms (i) − (iv) of Theorem 6.1.0.6. We
wish to prove that X is an ∞-topos. It is clear that any proof will need to make use of the full strength of
axioms (i) through (iv); in particular, we will need to apply (iv) to a class of groupoid objects of X which are
not obviously eﬀective. The purpose of this section is to describe a construction which will yields nontrivial
examples of groupoid objects, and to deduce a consequence (Proposition 6.1.4.2) which we will use in the
proof of Theorem 6.1.0.6.

Deﬁnition 6.1.4.1. Let f : X → Y be a functor between ∞-categories which admit ﬁnite limits. Let Z be
an object of X. We will say that f is left exact at Z if, for every pullback square

in X, the induced square

is a pullback in Y.

Proposition 6.1.4.2. Let X and Y be presentable ∞-categories, and let f : X → Y be a functor which
preserves small colimits. Suppose that every groupoid object in either X or Y is eﬀective. Let

Before giving the proof, we must establish some preliminary results.

Lemma 6.1.4.3. Let X and Y be ∞-categories which admit ﬁnite limits, let f : X → Y be a functor, and let
U• be a groupoid object of X. Suppose that f is left exact at U0. Then f ◦ U• is a groupoid object of Y.

Proof. This follows immediately from characterization (4′′) given in Proposition 6.1.2.6.

6.1.5 Giraud’s Theorem for ∞-Topoi

In this section, we will complete the proof of Theorem 6.1.0.6 by showing that every ∞-category X which
satisﬁes the ∞-categorical Giraud axioms (i) through (iv) arises as a left exact localization of an ∞-category
of presheaves. Our strategy is simple: we choose a small category C equipped with a functor f : C → X.
According to Theorem 5.1.5.6, we obtain a colimit-preserving functor F : P(C) → X which extends f , up
to homotopy. We will apply Proposition 6.1.4.2 to show that, under suitable hypotheses, F is a left exact
localization functor (Proposition 6.1.5.2).

Lemma 6.1.5.1. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal and coproducts are
disjoint.

Let {φi : Zi → Z}i∈I be a family of morphisms in X which exhibit Z as a coproduct of the family of

objects {Zi}i∈I . Let

W

α /

Zi

φi

Zj

φj

/ Z

be a square diagram in X. Then:

(1) If i 6= j, then the diagram is a pullback square if and only if W is an initial object of X.

(2) If i = j, then the diagram is a pullback square if and only if α is an equivalence.

Proof. Let Z ∨
each of the compositions

i be a coproduct for the objects {Zk}k∈I,k6=i, and let ψ : Z ∨

i → Z be a morphism such that

is equivalent to Z. Then there is a pushout square

Zk → Z ∨
i

ψ
→ Z

∅

Z ∨
i

β

ψ

Zi

φi

/ Z

where ∅ denotes an initial object of X. Since coproducts in X are disjoint, this pushout square is also a
pullback.
Let φ∗

i : X/Z → X/Zi denote a pullback functor. The above argument shows that φ∗
i (ψ) is an initial object
i (ψ) in X/Zi .
of X/Zi . If j 6= i, then there is a map of arrows φj → ψ in X/Z , and therefore a map φ∗
i (φj ) → φ∗
Consequently, if α ≃ φ∗
i (φj ), then W admits a map to an initial object of X, and is therefore itself initial
by Lemma 6.1.3.6. This proves the “only if” direction of (1). The converse follows from the uniqueness of
initial objects.

Now suppose that i = j. We observe that id/Z is a coproduct of φi and ψ in the ∞-category X/Z . Since
i preserves coproducts, we deduce that idZi is a coproduct of φ∗(φj) : X → Zi and β : ∅ → Zi in X/Zi .
φ∗
Since β is an initial object of X/Zi , we see that φ∗(φj ) is an equivalence. The natural map γ : α → φ∗
i (φi)
corresponds to a commutative diagram

W

α /

Zi

φ∗

i (φi)

/ Zi

in the ∞-category X. Consequently, α is an equivalence if and only if γ0 is an equivalence, if and only if γ
is an equivalence in X/Zi . This proves (2).

Proposition 6.1.5.2. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits, and let X be an ∞-category
which satisﬁes the ∞-categorical Giraud axioms (i) − (iv) of Theorem 6.1.0.6. Let F : P(C) → X be a
colimit-preserving functor. Suppose that the composition F ◦ j : C → X is left exact, where j : C → P(C)
denotes the Yoneda embedding. Then F is left exact.

Proof. According to Corollary 4.4.2.5, to prove that F is left exact, it will suﬃce to prove that F preserves
pullbacks and ﬁnal objects. Since all ﬁnal objects are equivalent, to prove that F preserves ﬁnal objects it
suﬃces to exhibit a single ﬁnal object Z of P(C) such that F Y ∈ X is ﬁnal. Let z be a ﬁnal object of C
(which exists in virtue of our assumption that C admits ﬁnite limits). Then Z = j(z) is a ﬁnal object of
P(C), since j preserves limits by Proposition 5.1.3.2. Consequently F (Z) = f (z) is ﬁnal, since f is left-exact.

Let α : Y → Z be a morphism in P(C). We will say that α is good if for every pullback square

in P(C), the induced square

/ F (Z)

is a pullback in X. Note that Lemma 4.4.2.1 implies that the class of good morphisms in P(C) is stable under
composition.

We rephrase this condition that a morphism α be good in terms of the pullback functors α∗ : P(C)/Z →

P(C)/Y , F (α)∗ : X/F (Z) → P(C)/F (Y ). Application of the functor F gives a map

t : F ◦ α∗ → F (α)∗ ◦ F

in the ∞-category of functors from P(C)/Z to X/F (Z), and α is good if and only if t is an equivalence. Note
that t is a natural transformation of colimit-preserving functors. Since the image of the Yoneda embedding
j : C → P(C) generates P(C) under colimits, it will suﬃce to prove that t is an equivalence when evaluated
on objects of the form β : j(x) → Z, where x is an object of C.

Let us say that an object Z ∈ P(C) is good if every morphism α : Y → Z is good. In other words, an
object Z ∈ P(C) is good if F is left exact at Z in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.1.4.1. By repeating the above
argument, we deduce that Z is good if and only if every morphism of the form α : j(y) → Z is good for
y ∈ C.

We next claim that for every object z ∈ C, the Yoneda image j(z) ∈ P(C) is good. In other words, we

Yoneda images of morphisms x → z, y → z. Since j preserves limits, we may reduce to the case where
the ﬁrst diagram is the Yoneda image of a pullback diagram in C. The desired result then follows from the
assumption that f is left exact.

To complete the proof that F is left exact, it will suﬃce to prove that every object of P(C) is good.
Because the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C) generates P(C) under colimits, it will suﬃce to prove that the
collection of good objects of P(C) is stable under colimits. According to Proposition 4.4.3.3, it will suﬃce to
prove that the collection of good objects of P(C) is stable under coequalizers and small coproducts.

We ﬁrst consider the case of coproducts. Let {Zi}i∈I be a family of good objects of P(C) indexed by a
(small) set I, and {φi : Zi → Z}i∈I be a family of morphisms which exhibit Z as a coproduct of the family
{Zi}i∈I . Suppose given a pullback diagram

P(C) → S. Consequently, we have a homotopy equivalence

in the homotopy category H. Therefore we may assume that α factors as a composition

MapP(C)(j(y), Z) ≃

for some i ∈ I. By assumption, the morphism α′ is good; it therefore suﬃces to prove that φi is good. By

P(C) → S π0→ N(Set)
where the ﬁrst functor is given by evaluation at x. Both of these functors commute with colimits. Conse-
quently, we have a coequalizer diagram

Since we have already assumed that β′ is good, we can replace β by the map s : Z0 → Z−1 in the above
diagram. By a similar argument, we can replace α : Y → Z−1 by the map s : Z0 → Z−1. We now obtain
the desired result by applying Proposition 6.1.4.2.

We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem 6.1.0.6:

Proposition 6.1.5.3. Let X be an ∞-category. Suppose that X satisﬁes the ∞-categorical Giraud axioms:

(i) The ∞-category X is presentable.

(ii) Colimits in X are universal.

(iii) Coproducts in X are disjoint.

(iv) Every groupoid object of X is eﬀective.

Then there exists a small ∞-category C which admits ﬁnite limits, and an accessible left exact localization
functor P(C) → X. In particular, X is an ∞-topos.

Proof. Let X be an ∞-topos. According to Proposition 5.4.7.4, there exists a regular cardinal τ such that
X is τ -accessible, and the full subcategory Xτ spanned by the τ -compact objects of X is stable under ﬁnite
limits. Let C be a minimal model for Xτ , so that there is an equivalence Indτ (C) → X. The proof of Theorem
5.5.1.1 shows that the inclusion Indτ (C) ⊆ P(C) has a left adjoint L. The composition of L with the Yoneda
embedding C → P(C) can be identiﬁed with the Yoneda embedding C → Indτ (C), therefore preserves all
limits which exist in C (Proposition 5.1.3.2). Applying Proposition 6.1.5.2, we deduce that L is left exact, so
that Indτ (C) is a left exact localization (automatically accessible) of P(C). Since X is equivalent to Indτ (C),
we conclude that X is also an accessible left exact localization of P(C).

6.1.6 ∞-Topoi and Classifying Objects

Let X be an ordinary category, and let X be an object of X. Let Sub(X) denote the partially ordered
collection of subobjects of X: an object of Sub(X) is an equivalence class of monomorphisms Y → X. If C is
accessible, then Sub(X) is actually a set. If X admits ﬁnite limits, then Sub(X) is contravariantly functorial
in X: given a subobject Y → X and any map X ′ → X, the ﬁber product Y ′ = X ′ ×X Y is a subobject
of X ′. A subobject classiﬁer is an object Ω of X which represents the functor Sub. In other words, Ω has a
universal subobject Ω0 ⊆ Ω such that every monomorphism Y → X ﬁts into a unique Cartesian diagram

(In this case, Ω0 is automatically a ﬁnal object of C.)

Every topos has a subobject classiﬁer.

In fact, in the theory of elementary topoi, the existence of a
subobject classiﬁer is taken as one of the axioms. Thus, the existence of a subobject classiﬁer is one of the
deﬁning characteristics of a topos. We would like to discuss the appropriate ∞-categorical generalization of
the theory of subobject classiﬁers. The ideas presented here are due to Charles Rezk.

Deﬁnition 6.1.6.1. Let X be an ∞-category which admits pullbacks, and S a collection of morphisms of X
which is stable under pullback. We will say that a morphism f : X → Y classiﬁes S if it is a ﬁnal object of
O(S)
X (see Notation 6.1.3.4). In this situation, we will also say that the object Y ∈ X classiﬁes S. A subobject
classiﬁer for X is an object which classiﬁes the collection of all monomorphisms in X.

Example 6.1.6.2. The ∞-category S of spaces has a subobject classiﬁer: namely, the discrete space {0, 1}
with two elements.

The following result provides a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of a classifying object

for S:

Proposition 6.1.6.3. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal, and let S be a
class of morphisms in X which is stable under pullbacks. There exists a classifying object for S if and only
if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The class S is local (Deﬁnition 6.1.3.8).

(2) For every object X ∈ X, the full subcategory of X/X spanned by the elements of S is essentially small.

S be a functor which classiﬁes the right ﬁbration O(S)

Proof. Let s : Xop →
X → X. Then S has a classifying
object if and only if s is a representable functor. According to the representability criterion of Proposition
5.5.2.2, this is equivalent to the assertion that s preserves small limits, and the essential image of s consists
of essentially small spaces. According to Lemma 6.1.3.7, s preserves small limits if and only if (1) is satisﬁed.
It now suﬃces to observe that for each X ∈ X, the space s(X) is essentially small if and only if the full
subcategory of X/X spanned by S is essentially small.

b

Using Proposition 6.1.6.3, one can show that every ∞-topos has a subobject classiﬁer. However, in the
∞-categorical context, the emphasis on subobjects misses the point. To see why, let us return to considering
an ordinary category X with a subobject classiﬁer Ω. By deﬁnition, for every object X ∈ X, we may identify
maps X → Ω with subobjects of X: that is, isomorphism classes of maps Y → X which happen to be
monomorphisms. Even better would be an object classiﬁer: that is, an object
Ω)
if Y → X is not
could be identiﬁed with arbitrary maps Y → X. But this is an unreasonable demand:
an monomorphism, then there may be automorphisms of Y as an object of X/X . It would be unnatural to
e
ignore these automorphisms. However, it is also not possible to take them into account, since HomX(X,
Ω)
must be a set rather than a groupoid.

Ω such that HomX(X,

e

If we allow X to be an ∞-category, this objection loses its force. Informally speaking, we can consider the
e
functor which associates to each X ∈ X the maximal ∞-groupoid contained in X/X (this is contravariantly
functorial in X, provided that X has ﬁnite limits). We might hope that this functor is representable by some
Ω∞ ∈ X, which we would then call an object classiﬁer.

Unfortunately, a new problem arises: it is generally unreasonable to ask for the collection of all morphisms
in X to be classiﬁed by an object of X, since this would require each slice X/X to be essentially small
(Proposition 6.1.6.3). This is essentially a technical diﬃculty, which we will circumvent by introducing a
cardinality bound.

Deﬁnition 6.1.6.4. Let X be a presentable ∞-category. We will say that a morphism f : X → Y is

such that Y ′ is κ-compact, X ′ is also κ-compact.

Lemma 6.1.6.5. Let X be a presentable ∞-category, κ a regular cardinal, J a κ-ﬁltered ∞-category, and
p : J⊲ → X a colimit diagram. Let f : X → Y be a morphism in X, where Y is the image under p of the
cone point of J⊲. For each α in J, let Yα = p(α) and form a pullback diagram

Suppose that each fα is relatively κ-compact. Then f is relatively κ-compact.

κ-ﬁltered, there exists a 2-simplex of X, corresponding to a diagram

Since f ′ is a pullback of fα, we conclude that Z ′ is κ-compact. Lemma 4.4.2.1 implies that f ′ is also a
pullback of f along g, so that f is relatively κ-compact as desired.

Lemma 6.1.6.6. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal. Let τ > κ be regular
cardinals such that X is κ-accessible and the full subcategory Xτ consisting of τ -compact objects of X is
stable under pullbacks in X. Let α : σ → σ′ be a Cartesian transformation between pushout squares σ, σ′ :
∆1 × ∆1 → X, which we may view as a pushout square

Cτ = C ∩ Fun(∆1 × ∆1, Xτ ). Since the class of τ -compact objects of X is stable under pushouts (Corollary

shows that every object of Fun(Λ2
It follows that σ′ ∈ C can be obtained as the colimit of a τ -ﬁltered diagram in Cτ . Since colimits in X are
universal, we conclude that the natural transformation α can be obtained as a τ -ﬁltered colimit of natural
i in Cτ . Lemma 5.5.2.3 implies that the inclusion C ⊆ Fun(∆1 × ∆1, X) is
transformations αi : σi → σ′
colimit-preserving. Consequently, we deduce that g′ can be written as a τ -ﬁltered colimit of morphisms {g′

determined by restricting {αi}. According to Lemma 6.1.6.6, it will suﬃce to prove that each morphism g′

0 takes values in Xτ . Since
σ is a pushout diagram, Corollary 5.3.4.15 implies that σ takes values in Xτ . Now we observe that g′ is
a morphism between τ -compact objects of X, and therefore automatically relatively τ -compact in virtue of
our assumption that Xτ is stable under pullbacks in X.

Proposition 6.1.6.7. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal, and let S be a
local class of morphisms in X. For each regular cardinal κ, let Sκ denote the collection of all morphisms f
which belong to S and are relatively κ-compact. If κ is suﬃciently large, then Sκ has a classifying object.

Proof. Choose κ′ such that X is κ′-accessible. The restriction functor r : Fun((Λ2

is accessible:
in fact, it preserves all colimits (Proposition 5.1.2.2). Let g be a right adjoint to r (a limit
functor); Proposition 5.4.7.7 implies that g is also accessible. Choose a regular cardinal κ′′ > κ′ such that g is

We will verify the hypotheses of Proposition 6.1.6.3. First, we must show that Sκ is local. For this, we will
verify condition (3) of Lemma 6.1.3.7. We begin by showing that Sκ is stable under small coproducts. Let
{fα : Xα → Yα}α∈A be a small collection of morphisms belonging to Sκ, and let f : X → Y be a coproduct
α∈A fα in Fun(∆1, X). We wish to show that f ∈ Sκ. Since S is local, we conclude that f ∈ S (using
Lemma 6.1.3.7). It therefore suﬃces to show that f is relatively κ-compact. Suppose given a κ-compact

from Lemma 6.1.6.6.

It remains to show that, for each X ∈ X, the full subcategory of X/X spanned by the elements of S is

6.2 Constructions of ∞-Topoi

According to Deﬁnition 6.1.0.4, an ∞-category X is an ∞-topos if and only if X arises as an (accessible)
left exact localization of a presheaf ∞-category P(C). To complete the analogy with classical topos theory,
we would like to have some concrete description of the collection of left exact localizations of P(C).
In
§6.2.1, we will study left exact localization functors in general, and single out a special class which we call
topological localizations. In §6.2.2, we will study topological localizations of P(C), and show that they are in
bijection with Grothendieck topologies on the ∞-category C, in exact analogy with classical topos theory. In
particular, given a Grothendieck topology on C, one can deﬁne an ∞-topos Shv(C) ⊆ P(C) of sheaves on C.
In §6.2.3, we will characterize Shv(C) by a universal mapping property. Unfortunately, not every ∞-topos
X can be obtained as topological localization of an ∞-category of presheaves. Nevertheless, in §6.2.4 we will
construct ∞-categories of sheaves which closely approximate X, using the formalism of canonical topologies.
These ideas will be applied in §6.4, to obtain a classiﬁcation theorem for n-topoi.

6.2.1 Left Exact Localizations

Let X be an ∞-category. Up to equivalence, a localization L : X → Y is determined by the collection S of
all morphisms f : X → Y in X such that Lf is an equivalence in Y (Proposition 5.5.4.2). Our ﬁrst result
provides a useful criterion for testing the left-exactness of L.

Proposition 6.2.1.1. Let L : X → Y be a localization of ∞-categories. Suppose that X admits ﬁnite limits.
The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The functor L is left exact.

(2) For every pullback diagram

X ′

f ′

Y ′

X

f

/ Y

in X such that Lf is an equivalence in Y, Lf ′ is also an equivalence in Y.

Proof. It is clear that (1) implies (2). Suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. We wish to show that L is left exact.
Let S be the collection of morphisms f in X such that Lf is an equivalence. Without loss of generality, we
may identify Y with the full subcategory of X spanned by the S-local objects. Since the ﬁnal object 1 ∈ X is
obviously S-local, we have L1 ≃ 1. Thus it will suﬃce to show that L commutes with pullbacks. We observe
that given any diagram X → Y ← Z, the pullback LX ×LY LZ is a limit of S-local objects of X, and therefore
S-local. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the natural map f : X ×Y Z → LX ×LY LZ
belongs to S. We can write f as a composition of maps

X ×Y Z → X ×LY Z → LX ×LY Z → LX ×LY LZ.

The last two maps are obtained from X → LX and Z → LZ by base change. Assumption (2) implies that
they belong to S. Thus, it will suﬃce to show that f ′ : X ×Y Z → X ×LY Z belongs to S. This map is a
pullback of the diagonal f ′′ : Y → Y ×LY Y , so it will suﬃce to prove that f ′′ ∈ S. Projection to the ﬁrst
factor gives a left homotopy inverse g : Y ×LY Y → Y of f ′′, so it suﬃces to prove that g ∈ S. But g is a
base change of the morphism Y → LY .

Proposition 6.2.1.2. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal. Let S be a class
of morphisms in X, and let S be the strongly saturated class of morphisms generated by S. Suppose that S

the morphism f ′ belongs to S. By assumption, S ⊆ S′. Using the fact that colimits are universal, we deduce
that S′ is strongly saturated. Consequently S ⊆ S′, as desired.

Corollary 6.2.1.3. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal, let S be a (small)
set of morphisms in X, and let S denote the smallest strongly saturated class of morphisms which contains S
and is stable under pullbacks. Then S is generated (as a strongly saturated class of morphisms) by a (small)
set.

Proof. Choose a (small) set U of objects of X which generates X under colimits. Enlarging U if necessary,
we may suppose that U contains the codomain of every morphism belonging to S. Let S′ be the set of all

Recall that a morphism f : Y → Z in an ∞-category X is a monomorphism if it is a (−1)-truncated
object of the ∞-category X/Z . Equivalently, f is a monomorphism if for every object X ∈ X, the induced
map

MapX(X, Y ) → MapX(X, Z)
exhibits MapX(X, Y ) ∈ H as a summand of MapX(X, Z) in the homotopy category H. If we ﬁx Z ∈ X,
then the collection of equivalence classes of monomorphisms Y → Z are partially ordered under inclusion.
We will denote this partially ordered collection by Sub(Z).

Proposition 6.2.1.4. Let X be a presentable ∞-category, and let X be an object of X. Then Sub(X) is a
(small) partially ordered set.

Proof. By deﬁnition, the partially ordered set Sub(X) is characterized by the existence of an equivalence

τ≤−1 X/X → N(Sub(X)).

Propositions 5.5.3.10 and 5.5.6.18 imply that N(Sub(X)) is presentable. Consequently, there exists a small
subset S ⊆ Sub(X) which generates N(Sub(X)) under colimits. It follows that every element of Sub(X) can
be written as the supremum of a subset of S, so that Sub(X) is also small.

Deﬁnition 6.2.1.5. Let X be a presentable ∞-category, and let S be a strongly saturated class of morphisms
of X. We will say that S is topological if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) There exists S ⊆ S consisting of monomorphisms such that S generates S as a strongly saturated class

of morphisms.

(2) Given a pullback diagram

X ′

f ′

Y ′

f

/ Y

in X such that f belongs to S, the morphism f ′ also belongs to S.

We will say that a localization L : X → Y is topological if the collection S of all morphisms f : X → Y in

X such that Lf is an equivalence is topological.

Proposition 6.2.1.6. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal, and let S be a
strongly saturated class of morphisms of X which is topological. Then there exists a (small) subset S0 ⊆ S
which consists of monomorphisms and generates S as a strongly saturated class of morphisms.

Proof. For every object U ∈ X, let Sub′(U ) ⊆ Sub(U ) denote the collection of equivalence classes of monomor-
phisms U ′ → U which belong to S. Choose a small collection of objects {Uα}α∈A which generates X un-
α ∈ Sub′(Uα), choose a representative monomorphism
der colimits. For each α ∈ A and each element
α : V
f
e

α → Uα which belongs to S. Let
e

S0 = {f

e

α|α ∈ A,
e

α ∈ Sub′(Uα)}.

It follows from Proposition 6.2.1.4 that S0 is a (small) set. Let S0 denote the strongly saturated class of
e
morphisms generated by S0. We will show that S0 = S.
Let X0 be the full subcategory of X spanned by objects U with the following property: if f : V → U
is a monomorphism and f ∈ S, then f ∈ S0. By construction, for each α ∈ A, Uα ∈ X0. Since colimits
in X are universal, it is easy to see that X0 is stable under colimits in X. It follows that X0 = X, so that
every monomorphism which belongs to S also belongs to S0. Since S is generated by monomorphisms, we
conclude that S = S0, as desired.

Corollary 6.2.1.7. Let X be a presentable ∞-category. Every topological localization L : X → Y is accessible
and left exact.

6.2.2 Grothendieck Topologies and Sheaves in Higher Category Theory

Every ordinary topos is equivalent to the category of sheaves on some Grothendieck site. This can be deduced
from the following pair of statements:

(i) Every topos is equivalent to a left exact localization of the some presheaf category SetCop

.

(ii) There is a bijective correspondence between left exact localizations of SetCop

and Grothendieck topolo-

gies on C.

In §6.1, we proved the ∞-categorical analogue of assertion (i). Unfortunately, (ii) is not quite true in the
∞-categorical setting. In this section, we will establish a slightly weaker statement: for every ∞-category
C, there is a bijective correspondence between Grothendieck topologies on C and topological localizations of
P(C) (Proposition 6.2.2.9). Our ﬁrst step is to introduce the ∞-categorical analogue of a Grothendieck site.
The following deﬁnition is taken from [78]:

Deﬁnition 6.2.2.1. Let C be a ∞-category. A sieve on C is a full subcategory of C(0) ⊆ C having the
property that if f : C → D is a morphism in C, and D belongs to C(0), then C also belongs to C(0).

Observe that if f : C → D is a functor between ∞-categories and D(0) ⊆ D is a sieve on D, then
f −1 D(0) = D(0) ×D C is a sieve on C. Moreover, if f is an equivalence, then f −1 induces a bijection between
sieves on D and sieves on C.

If C ∈ C is an object, then a sieve on C is a sieve on the ∞-category C/C. Given a morphism f : D → C
/C denote the unique sieve on D such that f ∗ C(0)
/C determine

/C on C, we let f ∗ C(0)

/C ⊆ C/D and C(0)

and a sieve C(0)
same sieve on C/f .

A Grothendieck topology on an ∞-category C consists of a speciﬁcation, for each object C of C, of a
collection of sieves on C, which we will refer to as covering sieves. The collections of covering sieves are
required to possess the following properties:

(1) If C is an object of C, then the sieve C/C ⊆ C/C on C is a covering sieve.

(2) If f : C → D is a morphism in C, and C(0)

/D is a covering sieve on D, then f ∗ C(0)

/C is a covering sieve on

C.

(3) Let C be an object of C, C(0)

/C a covering sieve on C, and C(1)

for each f : D → C belonging to the sieve C(0)
C(1)
/C is a covering sieve on C.

/C , the pullback f ∗ C(1)

/C an arbitrary sieve on C. Suppose that,
/C is a covering sieve on D. Then

Example 6.2.2.2. Any ∞-category C may be equipped with the trivial topology, in which a sieve C(0)
an object C of C is covering if and only if C(0)

/C on

/C = C/C .

Remark 6.2.2.3. In the case where C is (the nerve of) an ordinary category, the deﬁnition given above
reduces to the usual notion of a Grothendieck topology on C. Even in the general case, a Grothendieck
topology on C is just a Grothendieck topology on the homotopy category h C. This is not completely
obvious, since for an object C of C, the functor

η : h(C/C ) → (hC)/C

is usually not an equivalence of categories. A morphism from on the left hand side corresponds to a com-
mutative triangle

Although η need not be an equivalence of categories, η∗ does induce a bijection from the set of sieves on

(hC)/C to the set of sieves on h(C/C ): for this, it suﬃces to observe that η induces surjective maps

on morphism sets, which is obvious from the description given above.

Homh( C/C )(D, D′) → Hom(hC)/C (D, D′)

The main objective of this section is to prove that for any (small) ∞-category C, there is a bijective
correspondence between Grothendieck topologies on C and (equivalence classes of) topological localizations
of P(C). We begin by establishing a correspondence between sieves on C and (−1)-truncated objects of P(C).
For each object U ∈ P(C), let C(0)(U ) ⊆ C be the full subcategory spanned by those objects C ∈ C such that
U (C) 6= ∅. It is easy to see that C(0)(U ) is a sieve on C. Conversely, given a sieve C(0) ⊆ C, there is a unique
map C → ∆1 such that C(0) is the preimage of {0}. This construction determines a bijection between sieves
on C and functors f : C → ∆1, and we may identify ∆1 with the full subcategory of Sop spanned by the
objects ∅, ∆0 ∈ Kan. Since every (−1)-truncated Kan complex is equivalent to either ∅ or ∆0, we conclude:

Lemma 6.2.2.4. For every small ∞-category C, the construction U 7→ C(0)(U ) determines a bijection
between the set of equivalence classes of (−1)-truncated objects of P(C) and the set of all sieves on C.

We now introduce a relative version of the above construction. Let C be a small ∞-category as above,
and let j : C → P(C) be the Yoneda embedding. Let C ∈ C be an object, and let i : U → j(C) be a
monomorphism in P(C). Let C/C (U ) denote the full subcategory of C spanned by those objects f : D → C
of C/C such that there exists a commutative triangle

j(D)

!CCCCCCCC

={{{{{{{{

It is easy to see that C/C (U ) is a sieve on C. Moreover, it clear that if i : U → j(C) and i′ : U ′ → j(C) are
equivalent subobjects of j(C), then C/C (U ) = C/C (U ′).

Proposition 6.2.2.5. Let C be a small ∞-category containing an object C, and let j : C → P(C) be the
Yoneda embedding. The construction described above yields a bijection

(i : U → j(C)) 7→ C/C(U )

from Sub(j(C)) to the set of all sieves on C.

Proof. Use Corollary 5.1.6.12 to reduce to Lemma 6.2.2.4.

Deﬁnition 6.2.2.6. Let C be a (small) ∞-category equipped with a Grothendieck topology. Let S be the
collection of all monomorphisms U → j(C) which correspond to covering sieves C(0)
/C ⊆ C/C . An object
F ∈ P(C) is a sheaf if it is S-local. We let Shv(C) denote the full subcategory of P(C) spanned by S-local
objects.

Lemma 6.2.2.7. Let C be a (small) ∞-category equipped with a Grothendieck topology. Then Shv(C) is a
topological localization of P(C). In particular, Shv(C) is an ∞-topos.

Proof. By deﬁnition, Shv(C) = S−1 P(C), where S is the class of all monomorphisms i : U → j(C) which
correspond to covering sieves on C ∈ C. Let S be the strongly saturated class of morphisms generated by S;
we wish to show that S is stable under pullback.

the morphism f ′ belongs to S. Since colimits in P(C) are universal, it is easy to prove that S′ is strongly

suﬃce to prove that S ⊆ S′. We may therefore suppose that Y = j(C) in the diagram above, and that
f : X → j(C) is the monomorphism corresponding to a covering sieve C(0)

/C on C.

Since P(C)/j(C) ≃ P(C/C ) is generated under colimits by the Yoneda embedding, there exists a diagram
p : K → C/C such that the composite map j ◦ p : K → P(C)/j(C) has g : Y ′ → j(C) as a colimit. Because
colimits in P(C) are universal, we can extend j ◦ p to a diagram P : K → (P(C)∆1

The next lemma ensures us that we can recover a Grothendieck topology on C from its ∞-category of

sheaves Shv(C) ⊆ P(C).

Lemma 6.2.2.8. Let C be a (small ) ∞-category equipped with a Grothendieck topology, and let L : P(C) →
Shv(C) denote a left adjoint to the inclusion. Let j : C → P(C) denote the Yoneda embedding, and let
i : U → j(C) be a monomorphism corresponding to a sieve C(0)
/C on C. Then Li is an equivalence if and only
if C(0)

/C is a covering sieve.

Proof. It is clear that if C(0)
/C is a covering sieve, then Li is an equivalence. Conversely, suppose that Li is an
equivalence. Then τ≤0(Li) is an equivalence. In view of Proposition 5.5.6.28, we can identify τ≤0(Li) with
L(τ≤0i). The morphism τ≤0i can be identiﬁed with a monomorphism η : F ⊆ HomhC(•, C) in the ordinary
category of presheaves of sets on hC, where

F(D) = {f ∈ HomhC(D, C) : f ∈ C(0)

/C }.

If η becomes an equivalence after sheaﬁﬁcation, then the identity map idC : C → C belongs to F(C) locally;
in other words, there exists a collection of morphisms {fα : Cα → C} which generated a covering sieve on C
such that each fα belongs to F(Cα), and therefore to C(0)
/C contains a covering sieve on
C and is therefore itself covering.

/C . It follows that C(0)

We may summarize the results of this section as follows:

Proposition 6.2.2.9. Let C be a small ∞-category. There is a bijective correspondence between Grothendieck
topologies on C and (equivalence classes of) topological localizations of P(C).

Proof. According to Lemma 6.2.2.7, every Grothendieck topology on C determines a topological localization
Shv(C) ⊆ P(C). Lemma 6.2.2.8 shows that two Grothendieck topologies which determine the same ∞-
categories of sheaves must coincide. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that every topological
localization of P(C) arises in this way. Let S be a strongly saturated collection of morphisms in P(C), and
suppose that S is topological. Let S ⊆ S be the collection of all monomorphisms U → j(C) which belong to
S, where j : C → P(C) denotes the Yoneda embedding. Since the objects {j(C)}C∈C generate P(C) under
colimits, and colimits in P(C) are universal, we conclude that every monomorphism in S is a colimit of
elements of S. Since S is generated by monomorphisms, we conclude that S is generated by S.

Let us say that a sieve C(0)

/C ⊆ C/C on an object C ∈ C is covering if the corresponding monomorphism
U → j(C) belongs to S. We will show that the collection of covering sieves determines a Grothendieck
−1 P(C) is the ∞-category Shv(C) ⊆ P(C) of sheaves with
topology on C. Granting this, we observe that S
respect to this Grothendieck topology, which will complete the proof.
We now verify the axioms (1) through (3) of Deﬁnition 6.2.2.1:

(1) Every sieve of the form C/C ⊆ C/C is covering, since every identity map idj(C) : j(C) → j(C) belongs

to S.

(2) Let f : C → D be a morphism in C, and let C(0)

/D ⊆ C/D be a covering sieve, corresponding to a
monomorphism i : U → j(D) which belongs to S. Then f ∗ C(0)
/C ⊆ C/C corresponds to a monomorphism
u : U ′ → j(C) which is a pullback of i along j(f ), and therefore belongs to S (since S is stable under
pullbacks).

(3) Let C be an object of C, C(0)
/C a covering sieve on C corresponding to a monomorphism i : U → j(C)
which belongs to S, and C(1)
/C an arbitrary sieve on C corresponding to a monomorphism v : U ′ → j(C).
Suppose that, for each f : D → C belonging to the sieve C(0)
/C is a covering sieve on
D. Since j′ : C/C → P(C)/j(C) is a fully faithful embedding which generates P(C)/j(C) under colimits
(see the proof of Corollary 5.1.6.12), we conclude there is a diagram K → C/C such that j′ ◦ K has
colimit i′. Since colimits in P(C) are universal, we conclude that the map v′ : U ×j(C) U ′ → U is a
colimit of morphisms of the form j(D) ×j(C) U ′ → j(D), which belong to S by assumption. Since S is
stable under colimits, we conclude that i′′ belongs to S. We now have a pullback diagram

/C , the pullback f ∗ C(1)

U ′

By assumption, u ∈ S. Thus v ◦ u′ ∼ u ◦ v′ ∈ S. Since u′ is a pullback of u, we conclude that u′ ∈ S,
so that v ∈ S. This implies that C(1)

/C ⊆ C/C is a covering sieve, as we wished to prove.

For later use, we record the following characterization of initial objects in ∞-categories of sheaves:

Proposition 6.2.2.10. Let C be a small ∞-category equipped with a Grothendieck topology, and let C′ ⊆ C
denote the full subcategory spanned by those objects C ∈ C such that ∅ ⊆ C/C is a covering sieve on C. An
object F ∈ Shv(C) is initial if and only if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) If C ∈ C′, then F(C) is contractible.

(2) If C /∈ C′, then F(C) is empty.

465

(cid:15)

Proof. Let L : P(C) → Shv(C) be a left adjoint to the inclusion, and let ∅ be an initial object of P(C).
Then L∅ is an initial object of Shv(C). Since L is left exact, it preserves (−1)-truncated objects, as does
the inclusion Shv(C) ⊆ P(C). Thus L∅ is (−1)-truncated, and corresponds to some sieve C(0) ⊆ C (Lemma
6.2.2.4). As we saw in the proof of Lemma 6.2.2.8, a sieve C(0) classiﬁes an object of Shv(C) is and only if
C(0) is saturated in the following sense: if C ∈ C and the induced sieve C(0) ×C C/C is covering, then C ∈ C(0).
An initial object of Shv(C) is an initial object of τ≤−1 Shv(C), and must therefore correspond to the smallest
saturated sieve on C. An easy argument shows that this sieve is C′, and that F ∈ P(C) is a (−1)-truncated
object classiﬁed by C′ if and only if conditions (1) and (2) are satisﬁed.

6.2.3 Eﬀective Epimorphisms

In classical topos theory, the assumption that every equivalence relation is eﬀective leads to a bijective
correspondence between equivalence relations on an object X and eﬀective epimorphisms X → Y . The
purpose of this section is to generalize the notion of an eﬀective epimorphism to the ∞-categorical setting.
Our primary interest is studying the class of eﬀective epimorphisms in an ∞-topos X. However, we will
later need to employ the same ideas when X is an n-topos, for n < ∞. It is therefore convenient to work in
a slightly more general setting.

Deﬁnition 6.2.3.1. An ∞-category X is a semitopos if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) The ∞-category X is presentable.

(2) Colimits in X are universal.

(3) For every morphism f : U → X, the underlying groupoid of the ˇCech nerve ˇC(f ) is eﬀective (see

§6.1.2).

Remark 6.2.3.2. Every ∞-topos is a semitopos; this follows immediately from Theorem 6.1.0.6.

Remark 6.2.3.3. If X is a semitopos, then so is X/X for every object X ∈ X.

Proposition 6.2.3.4. Let X be a semitopos. Let p : U → X be a morphism in X, let U• be the underlying
simplicial object of the ˇCech nerve ˇC(p), let V ∈ X be a colimit of U•. The induced diagram

U

p

 @@@@@@@

X

V

~~~~~~~~

p′

identiﬁes p′ with a (−1)-truncation of p in X/X .

Proof. We ﬁrst show that V is (−1)-truncated. It suﬃces to show that the diagonal map V → V ×X V is
an equivalence. We may identify V with V ×V V . Since colimits in X are universal, it will suﬃce to prove
that for each m, n ≥ 0, the natural map

pn.m : Um ×V Un → Um ×X Un

is an equivalence. We next observe that each pn,m is a pullback of

p0,0 : U ×V U → U ×X U.

Because U• is an eﬀective groupoid, both sides may be identiﬁed with U1.

To complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that the natural map MapX/X (p′, q) → MapX/X (p, q) is an
equivalence whenever q : E → X is a monomorphism. Note that both sides are either empty or contractible.
We must show that if MapX/X (p, q) is nonempty, then so is MapX/X (p′, q). We observe that the map

466

/
/
 
~
X/q → X/X is fully faithful, and that its essential image is a sieve on X/X . If that sieve contains p, then it
contains the entire groupoid U• (viewed as a groupoid in X/X ). We conclude that there exists a groupoid
object W• : N(∆)op → X/q lifting U•. Let
V ∈ X/q be a colimit of V•. According to Proposition 1.2.13.8, the
V proves that MapX /X (p′, q)
image of
is nonempty, as desired.

V in X/X can be identiﬁed with the map p′ : V → X. The existence of

Corollary 6.2.3.5. Let X be a semitopos, and let f : U → X be a morphism in X. The following conditions
are equivalent:

(1) If we regard f as an object of the ∞-category X/X , then τ≤−1(f ) is a ﬁnal object of X/X .

(2) The ˇCech nerve ˇC(f ) is a simplicial resolution of X.

We will say that a morphism f : U → X in an semitopos X is an eﬀective epimorphism if it satisﬁes the
equivalent conditions of Corollary 6.2.3.5. There is a one-to-one correspondence between eﬀective epimor-
phisms and eﬀective groupoids. More precisely, let ResEﬀ (X) denote the full subcategory of the ∞-category
X∆+ spanned by those augmented simplicial objects U• which are both ˇCech nerves and simplicial resolutions.
The restriction functors

Fun(∆1, X)

induce equivalences of ∞-categories from ResEﬀ (X) to the full subcategory of X∆ spanned by the eﬀective
groupoids, and from ResEﬀ (X) to the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, X) spanned by the eﬀective epimorphisms.

Remark 6.2.3.6. Let f∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi, and let u : U → Y be an eﬀective
epimorphism in Y. Then f ∗(u) is an eﬀective epimorphism in X. To see this, choose a ˇCech nerve U• of u.
Since u is an eﬀective epimorphism, U• is a colimit diagram. The left exactness of f ∗ implies that f ∗ ◦ U• is
a ˇCech nerve of f ∗(u). Since f ∗ is a left adjoint, we conclude that f ∗ ◦ U• is a colimit diagram so that f ∗(u)
is an eﬀective epimorphism.

The following result summarizes a few basic properties of eﬀective epimorphisms:

Proposition 6.2.3.7. Let X be a semitopos.

(1) Any equivalence X → Y in X is an eﬀective epimorphism.

(2) If f, g : X → Y are homotopic morphisms in X, then f is an eﬀective epimorphism if and only if g is

an eﬀective epimorphism.

(3) If F : Y → X is a left exact presentable functor between semitopoi, and f : U → X is an eﬀective

epimorphism in X, then F (f ) is an eﬀective epimorphism in Y.

Proof. Assertions (1) and (2) are obvious. To prove (3), we observe that f is an eﬀective epimorphism if and
only if it can be extended to an augmented simplicial object U• which is both a simplicial resolution and a
ˇCech nerve. Since F is left exact, it preserves the property of being a ˇCech nerve; since F preserves colimits,
it preserves the property of being a simplicial resolution.

Remark 6.2.3.8. Let X be a semitopos, and let f : X → T be an eﬀective epimorphism in X Applying part
(3) of Proposition 6.2.3.7 to the geometric morphism f : X/S → X/T induced by a morphism S → T in X,
we deduce that any base change X ×T S → X of f is also an eﬀective epimorphism.

In order to verify other basic properties of the class of eﬀective epimorphisms, such as stability under
composition, we will need to reformulate the property of surjectivity in terms of subobjects. Let X be
presentable ∞-category. For each X ∈ X, the ∞-category τ≤−1 X/X of subobjects of X is equivalent to the
nerve of a partially ordered set which we will denote by Sub(X); we may identify Sub(X) with the set of
equivalence classes of monomorphisms U → X. A morphism f : X → Y in X induces a left exact pullback
functor X/X → X/Y . This functor preserves (−1)-truncated objects by Proposition 5.5.6.16, and therefore
induces a map f ∗ : Sub(Y ) → Sub(X) of partially ordered sets.

Remark 6.2.3.9. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal. Then any monomor-
phism u : U →
Xα can be obtained as a coproduct of maps uα : Uα → Xα, where each uα is a pullback
of u and therefore also a monomorphism. It follows that the natural map

`

θ : Sub(

Xα) →

Sub(Xα)

a
is a monomorphism of partially ordered sets. If coproducts in X are disjoint, then θ is bijective.

Y

Proposition 6.2.3.10. Let X be a semitopos. A morphism f : U → X in X is an eﬀective epimorphism if
and only if f ∗ : Sub(X) → Sub(U ) is injective.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that f ∗ is injective. Let U• be the underlying groupoid of a ˇCech nerve of f , let V be
a colimit of U•, let u : V → X be the corresponding monomorphism, and let [V ] denote the corresponding
element of Sub(X). Since f factors through u, we conclude that f ∗[V ] = f ∗[X] = [U ] ∈ Sub(U ). Invoking
the injectivity of f ∗, we conclude that [V ] = [X] so that u is an equivalence.

For the converse, let us suppose that f is an eﬀective epimorphism. Let [V ] and [V ′] be elements of
Sub(X), represented by monomorphisms u : V → X and u′ : V ′ → X, and suppose that f ∗[V ] = f ∗[V ′].
We wish to prove that [V ] = [V ′]. Since f ∗ is a left exact functor, we have f ∗([V ] ∩ [V ′]) = f ∗[V ×X V ′].
It will suﬃce to prove that [V ′] = [V ×X V ′]; the same argument will then establish that [V ] = [V ×X V ′]
and the proof will be complete. In other words, we may assume without loss of generality that [V ] ⊆ [V ′] so
that there is a commutative diagram

We wish to show that g is an equivalence. The map g induces a natural transformation of augmented
simplicial objects

α• : u∗ ◦ ˇC(f ) → u′∗ ◦ ˇC(f ).
We observe that g can be identiﬁed with α−1. Since f is an eﬀective epimorphism, ˇC(f ) is a colimit diagram.
Since colimits in X are universal, we conclude that α−1 is a colimit of α| N(∆)op. Consequently, to prove
that α−1 is an equivalence, it will suﬃce to prove that αn is an equivalence for n ≥ 0. Since each αn is a
pullback of α0, it will suﬃce to prove that α0 is an equivalence. But this is simply a reformulation of the
condition that f ∗[V ] = f ∗[V ′].

From this we immediately deduce some corollaries.

Corollary 6.2.3.11. Let X be a semitopos, and let {fα : Xα → Yα} be a (small) collection of eﬀective
epimorphisms in X. Then the induced map

is an eﬀective epimorphism.

(1) If f and g are eﬀective epimorphisms, then so is h.

(2) If h is an eﬀective epimorphism, then so is g.

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 6.2.3.10, and the observation that we have an equality
f ∗ ◦ g∗ = h∗ of functions Sub(Z) → Sub(X).

The theory of eﬀective epimorphism is a mechanism for proving theorems by descent.

(which is well-deﬁned up to homotopy) is an eﬀective epimorphism.

Proof. For each vertex x of K ⊲, let Zx = p(x), and if x belongs to K we will denote the corresponding map
x E′ for each vertex x of K; we wish to
Zx → Z∞ by fx. Let E′′ ⊆ E′ ∈ Sub(Z∞) be such that f ∗
show that E′′ = E′. We can represent E′′ and E′ by a 2-simplex σ∞ : ∆2 → X, which we depict as

Proof. We ﬁrst show that (1) ⇒ (2). Let Y• : N(∆+)op → X be a ˇCech nerve of the map g, and choose
a Cartesian transformation f• : X• → Y• of augmented simplicial objects which extends f . Then we can
identify f ′ with f0 : X0 → Y0. Each fn is a pullback of f0, and therefore belongs to S. Applying Lemma
6.1.3.5, we deduce that f belongs to S as well.

Conversely, suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. We will show that S satisﬁes criterion (3) of Lemma 6.1.3.7.

in X. If f is an eﬀective epimorphism, then so is f ′. The converse holds if g is an eﬀective epimorphism.
Proof. Let g∗ : X/S → X/S′
be a pullback functor. Without loss of generality we may suppose that f ′ = g∗f .
Let U• : N(∆+)op → X be a ˇCech nerve of f . Since g∗ is left exact (being a right adjoint), we conclude that
g∗ ◦ U• is a ˇCech nerve of f ′. If f is an eﬀective epimorphism, then U• is a colimit diagram. Because colimits
in X are universal, g∗ ◦ U• is also a colimit diagram, so that f ′ is an eﬀective epimorphism.

Conversely, suppose that f ′ and g are eﬀective epimorphisms. Corollary 6.2.3.12 implies that g ◦ f ′ is an
eﬀective epimorphism. The commutativity of the diagram implies that f ◦ g′ is an eﬀective epimorphism, so
that f is an eﬀective epimorphism (Corollary 6.2.3.12 again).

formation α• : U• → V•. The map α0 can be identiﬁed with f ′, and is therefore an equivalence. For n ≥ 0,
αn : Un → Vn is a pullback of α0, and therefore also an equivalence. Since g is an eﬀective epimorphism,
V• is a colimit diagram. Applying Proposition 6.2.3.15, we conclude that g′ is also an eﬀective epimorphism
so that U• is a colimit diagram. It follows that f = α−1 is a colimit of equivalences, and is therefore an
equivalence.

in X. If f is n-truncated, then so is f ′. The converse holds if g is an eﬀective epimorphism.
Proof. Let g∗ : X/S → X/S′
be a pullback functor. The ﬁrst part of (1) asserts that g∗ carries n-truncated
objects to n-truncated objects. This follows immediately from Proposition 5.5.6.16, since g∗ is a right adjoint
and therefore left exact. We will prove the converse in a slightly stronger form: if i : U → V is a morphism
in X/S such that then g∗(i) is an n-truncated morphism in X/S′
, then i is n-truncated. The proof is by
induction on n. If n ≥ −1, we can use Lemma 5.5.6.15 to reduce to the problem of showing that the diagonal
map δ : U → U ×V U is (n − 1)-truncated. Since g∗ is left exact, we can identify g∗(δ) with the diagonal
map g∗U → g∗U ×g∗V g∗U , which is (n − 1)-truncated according to Lemma 5.5.6.15; the desired result then
follows from the inductive hypothesis. In the case n = −2, we have a pullback diagram

Let C be a small ∞-category equipped with a Grothendieck topology. Our ﬁnal goal in this section is to

use the language of eﬀective epimorphisms to characterize the ∞-topos Shv(C) by a universal property.

Lemma 6.2.3.18. Let C be a (small) ∞-category containing an object C, let {fα : Cα → C}α∈A be a
collection of morphisms indexed by a set A and let C(0)
/C ⊆ C/C be the sieve on C that they generate. Let
j : C → P(C) denote the Yoneda embedding and i : U → j(C) a monomorphism corresponding to the sieve
C(0)
/C . Then i can be identiﬁed with a (−1)-truncation of the induced map
α∈A j(Cα) → j(C) in the ∞-topos
P(C)/C .

`

Proof. Using Proposition 6.2.2.5, we can identify the equivalence classes of (−1)-truncated object U ∈
P(C)/j(C) with sieves C(0)
It is not diﬃcult to see that j(fα) factors through U if and only if
fα ∈ C(0)
α∈A j(Cα) → j(C) is associated to the smallest sieve on
C which contains each fα.

Lemma 6.2.3.19. Let X be an ∞-topos, C a small ∞-category equipped with a Grothendieck topology, and
f∗ : X → P(C) a functor with a left exact left adjoint f ∗ : P(C) → X.

The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The functor f∗ factors through Shv(C) ⊆ P(C).

(2) For every collection of morphisms {vα : Cα → C} which generate a covering sieve in C, the induced

map

f ∗(j(Cα)) → f ∗(j(C))

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed, and let {vα : Cα → C} be a collection of morphisms as in the
statement of (2). Let L : P(C) → Shv(C) be a left adjoint to the inclusion. Then we have an equivalence of
functors f ∗ ≃ (f ∗| Shv(C)) ◦ L. Applying Remark 6.2.3.6, we are reduced to showing that if

where u′ is an eﬀective epimorphism and u′′ is a monomorphism. We wish to show that Lu′′ is an equivalence.
Lemma 6.2.3.18 allows us to identify u′′ with the monomorphism associated to the sieve C(0)
/C on C generated
by the maps vα. By assumption, this is a covering sieve, so that Lu′′ is an equivalence in Shv(C) by
construction.

Conversely, suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Let C ∈ C and let C(0)

/C ⊆ C/C be a covering sieve on C associated
to a monomorphism u′′ : U → j(C). We wish to show that f ∗u′′ is an equivalence. According to Lemma
6.2.3.18, we have a factorization

j(Cα) u′

→ U u′′

→ j(C),

where the maps vα : Cα → C are chosen to generate the sieve C(0)
/C, and u′ is an eﬀective epimorphism. Let u
be a composition of u′ and u′′. Then f ∗u′ is an eﬀective epimorphism (Remark 6.2.3.6), and f ∗u is an eﬀective
epimorphism by assumption (2). Corollary 6.2.3.12 now shows that f ∗u′′ is an eﬀective epimorphism. Since
f ∗u′′ is also a monomorphism, we conclude that f ∗u′′ is an equivalence as desired.

Proposition 6.2.3.20. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let C be a small ∞-category equipped with a Grothendieck
topology. Let L : P(C) → Shv(C) denote a left adjoint to the inclusion, and j : C → P(C) the Yoneda
embedding. Let Fun∗(Shv(C), X) denote the ∞-category of left exact, colimit-preserving functors from Shv(C)
to X (Deﬁnition 6.3.1.10). The composition

J : Fun∗(Shv(C), X) L→ Fun∗(P(C), X)

j
→ Fun(C, X)

is fully faithful. Suppose furthermore that C admits ﬁnite limits. Then a functor f : C → X belongs to the
essential image of J if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The functor f is left exact.

(2) For every collection of morphisms {Cα → C}α∈A which generate a covering sieve on C, the associated

morphism

is an eﬀective epimorphism in X.

f (Cα) → f (C)

aα∈A

Proof. If the topology on C is trivial, then Theorem 5.1.5.6 implies that J is fully faithful, and the description
of the essential image of J follows from Proposition 6.1.5.2. In the general case, Proposition 5.5.4.20 implies
that composition with L induces a fully faithful embedding

J ′ : Fun∗(Shv(C), X) → Fun∗(P(C), X),

so that J is a composition of J ′ with a fully faithful functor

J ′′ : Fun∗(P(C), X) → Fun(C, X).

Suppose that C admits ﬁnite limits and that f satisﬁes (1), so that f is equivalent to J ′′(u∗) for some left
exact, colimit preserving u∗ : P(C) → X. The functor u∗ is unique up to equivalence, and Lemma 6.2.3.19
ensures that u∗ belongs to the essential image of J ′ if and only if condition (2) is satisﬁed.

472

Remark 6.2.3.21. It is possible to formulate a generalization of Proposition 6.2.3.20 which describes the
essential image of J even when C does not admit ﬁnite limits. The present version will be suﬃcient for the
applications in this book.

6.2.4 Canonical Topologies

Let X be an ∞-topos. Suppose that we wish to identify X with an ∞-category of sheaves. The ﬁrst step is
to choose a pair of adjoint functors

P(C)

F

G

/ X

where F is left exact. According to Theorem 5.1.5.6, F is determined up to equivalence by the composition

We might then try to choose a topology on C such that G factors as a composition

f : C j

→ P(C) F→ X .

X G′

→ Shv(C) ⊆ P(C).

Though it is not always possible to guarantee that G′ is an equivalence, we will show that for an appropriately
chosen topology (Deﬁnition 6.2.4.1), the ∞-topos Shv(C) is a close approximation to X (Proposition 6.2.4.6).

Deﬁnition 6.2.4.1. Let X be a semitopos, C a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits, and f : C → X
a left exact functor. We will say that a sieve C(0)
/C ⊆ C/C on an object C ∈ C is a canonical covering relative
to f if there exists a collection of morphisms {uα : Cα → C} belonging to C(0)
/C such that the induced map

f (Cα) → f (C) is an eﬀective epimorphism in X.

`

Our ﬁrst goal is to verify that the canonical topology is actually a Grothendieck topology on C.

Proposition 6.2.4.2. Let f : C → X be as in Deﬁnition 6.2.4.1. The collection of canonical coverings
relative to f determine a Grothendieck topology on C.

Proof. Since any identity map idf (C) : f (C) → f (C) is an eﬀective epimorphism, it is clear that the sieve
C/C is a canonical covering of C for every C ∈ C. Suppose that C(0)
/C ⊆ C/C is a canonical covering of C,
and that g : D → C is a morphism in C. We wish to prove that the induced sieve g∗ C(0)
/C is a canonical
covering. Choose a collection of objects uα : Cα → C of C(0)
α f (Cα) → f (C)
is an eﬀective epimorphism, and form pullback diagrams

Eα,β → C. Each of these compositions belong to C(1)

For later use, we record a few features of the canonical topology:

Lemma 6.2.4.3. Let f : C → X be as in Deﬁnition 6.2.4.1, and regard C as endowed with the canonical
topology relative to f . Let j : C → P(C) denote the Yoneda embedding and let L : P(C) → Shv(C) be a left
adjoint to the inclusion. Suppose that C ∈ C is such that f (C) is an initial object of X. Then Lj(C) is an
initial object of Shv(C).

Proof. If f (C) is an initial object of X, then the empty sieve ∅ ⊆ C/C is a covering sieve with respect to the
canonical topology. By construction, the associated monomorphism ∅ → j(C) becomes an equivalence after
applying L, so that Lj(C) is initial in Shv(C).

Lemma 6.2.4.4. Let f : C → X be as in Deﬁnition 6.2.4.1. Suppose that f is fully faithful, coproducts in X
are disjoint, and let {uα : Cα → C} be a small collection of morphisms in C such that the morphisms f (uα)
exhibit f (C) as a coproduct of the family {f (Cα)}. Let F : Cop → S be a sheaf on C (with respect to the
canonical topology induced by f ). Then the morphisms {F(uα)} exhibit F(C) as a product of {F(Cα)} in S.

Proof. We wish to show that the natural map F(C) →
F(Cα) is an isomorphism in the homotopy
category H. We may identify the left hand side with MapP(C)(j(C), F), and the right hand side with
MapP(C)(

j(Cα), F). Consequently, it will suﬃce to show that the natural map

to the canonical topology, so that Lv′′ is an equivalence in Shv(C). It follows that Lv is equivalent to Lv′,

where Vβ can be written as a coproduct
j(Cβ ×C Cβ) of Vβ with j(Cβ), and the restriction of vβ to this summand is an equivalence. To complete
the proof, it will suﬃce to show that for every other summand Dα,β = j(Cα ×C Cβ ), the localization LD is
an initial object of Shv(C). To prove this, we observe Lemma 6.1.5.1 implies that f (Cα ×C Cβ) is an initial
object of X, and apply Lemma 6.2.4.3.

Lemma 6.2.4.5. Let C be a small ∞-category equipped with a Grothendieck topology, and let u : F′ → F
be a morphism in Shv(C). Suppose that, for each C ∈ C and each η ∈ π0 F(C), there exists a collection of
morphisms {Cα → C} which generates a covering sieve on C and a collection of ηα ∈ π0 F′(Cα) such that η
and ηα have the same image in π0 F(Cα). Then u is an eﬀective epimorphism.

Proof. Replacing F by its image in F′ if necessary, we may suppose that u is a monomorphism. Let L :
P(C) → Shv(C) be a left adjoint to the inclusion, and let D be the full subcategory of P(C) spanned by those
objects G such that, for every pullback diagram

that D = P(C). We ﬁrst observe that, since colimits in P(C) are universal and L commutes with colimits,
D is stable under colimits in P(C). Since P(C) is generated under colimits by the image of the Yoneda
embedding, it will suﬃce to prove that j(C) ∈ D, for each C ∈ C. Choose a map j(C) → F, classiﬁed up to

category of sheaves.

Proposition 6.2.4.6. Let X be a semitopos, C a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits, and

a pair of adjoint functors. Suppose that the composition

f : C j

is left exact, and regard C as endowed with the canonical topology relative to f . Then:

(1) The functor G factors through Shv(C).

(2) Suppose that f is fully faithful and generates X under colimits. Then G carries eﬀective epimorphisms

in X to eﬀective epimorphisms in Shv(C).

Proof. In view of the deﬁnition of the canonical topology, (1) is equivalent to the following assertion: given
a collection of morphisms {uα : Cα → C} in C such that the induced map u :
α Cα → C is an eﬀective
epimorphism in X, if i : U → j(C) is the monomorphism in P(C) corresponding to the sieve C(0)
/C ⊆ C/C
generated by the collection {uα}, then F (i) is an equivalence in X. Let u′ :
α j(Cα) → j(C) be the
coproduct of the family {j(uα)}, and let V• : ∆op
+ → P(C) be a ˇCech nerve of u′. Then i can be identiﬁed
with the induced map from the colimit of V•| N(∆)op to V−1. Since F preserves colimits, to show that F (i)
is an equivalence, it will suﬃce to show that F ◦ V• is a colimit diagram. Since u is an eﬀective epimorphism,
it suﬃces to observe that F ◦ V• is equivalent to the ˇCech nerve of u.

We now prove (2). Suppose that u : Y → Z is an eﬀective epimorphism in X. We wish to prove that Gu
is an eﬀective epimorphism in Shv(C). We will show that the criterion of Lemma 6.2.4.5 is satisﬁed. Choose

epimorphism u′′ :
a family of maps wα : f (Cα) → f (C) in X. Since f is fully faithful, we may suppose that each wα = f vα
for some map vα : Cα → C in C. It follows that the collection of maps {vα} generate a covering sieve on C

6.3 The ∞-Category of ∞-Topoi

In this section, we will show that the collection of all ∞-topoi can be organized into an ∞-category RTop. The
objects of RTop are ∞-topoi, and the morphisms are called geometric morphisms; we will give a deﬁnition in
§6.3.1. In §6.3.2, we will show that RTop admits (small) colimits. In §6.3.3, we will show that RTop admits
(small) ﬁltered limits; we will treat the case of general limits in §6.3.4.

Let X be an ∞-topos containing an object U . In §6.3.5, we will show that the ∞-category X/U is an
∞-topos. Moreover, this ∞-topos is equipped with a canonical geometric morphism X/U → X. Geometric
morphisms which arise via this construction are said to be ´etale. In §6.3.6, we will deﬁne a more general
notion of algebraic morphism between ∞-topoi. We will also prove a structure theorem which implies that,
under certain hypotheses, every ∞-topos X admits an algebraic morphism to an ∞-category of sheaves on
a 2-category.

6.3.1 Geometric Morphisms

In classical topos theory, the correct notion of morphism between two topoi is an adjunction

X

f ∗

f∗

/ Y

where the functor f ∗ is left exact. We will introduce the same ideas in the ∞-categorical setting.

Deﬁnition 6.3.1.1. Let X and Y be ∞-topoi. A geometric morphism from X to Y is a functor f∗ : X → Y
which admits a left exact left adjoint (which we will typically denote by f ∗).

Remark 6.3.1.2. Let f∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism from an ∞-topos X to another ∞-topos Y, so
that f∗ admits a left adjoint f ∗. Either functor f∗ and f ∗ determines the other up to equivalence (in fact,
up to contractible ambiguity). We will often abuse terminology by referring to f ∗ as a geometric morphism
from X to Y. We will always indicate in our notation whether the left or right adjoint is being considered: a
superscripted asterisk indicates a left adjoint (pullback functor), and a subscripted asterisk indicates a right
adjoint (pushforward functor).

Remark 6.3.1.3. Any equivalence of ∞-topoi is a geometric morphism. If f∗, g∗ : X → Y are homotopic,
then f∗ is a geometric morphism if and only if g∗ is a geometric morphism (because we can identify left
adjoints of f∗ with left adjoints of g∗).

Remark 6.3.1.4. Let f∗ : X → Y and g∗ : Y → Z be geometric morphisms. Then f∗ and g∗ admit left exact
left adjoints, which we will denote by f ∗ and g∗, respectively. The composite functor f ∗ ◦ g∗ is left exact,
and is a left adjoint to g∗ ◦ f∗ by Proposition 5.2.2.6. We conclude that g∗ ◦ f∗ is a geometric morphism, so
the class of geometric morphisms is stable under composition.

Cat∞ denote the ∞-category of (not necessarily small) ∞-categories. We deﬁne

Deﬁnition 6.3.1.5. Let
subcategories LTop, RTop ⊆
d
(1) The objects of LTop and RTop are the ∞-topoi.

Cat∞ as follows:

d

(2) A functor f ∗ : X → Y between ∞-topoi belongs to LTop if and only if f ∗ preserves small colimits and

ﬁnite limits.

(3) A functor f∗ : X → Y between ∞-topoi belongs to RTop if and only if f∗ has a left adjoint which is

left exact.

The ∞-categories LTop and RTop are canonically anti-equivalent. To prove this, we will use the argument

of Corollary 5.5.3.4. First, we need a deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 6.3.1.6. A map p : X → S of simplicial sets is a topos ﬁbration if the following conditions are
satisﬁed:

(1) The map p is both a Cartesian ﬁbration and a coCartesian ﬁbration.

(2) For every vertex s of S, the corresponding ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s} is an ∞-topos.

(3) For every edge e : s → s′ in S, the associated functor Xs → Xs′ is left exact.

The following analogue of Proposition 5.5.3.3 follows immediately from the deﬁnitions:

Proposition 6.3.1.7.
χ : Sop →

(1) Let p : X → S be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, classiﬁed by a map

Cat∞. Then p is a topos ﬁbration if and only if χ factors through RTop ⊆

Cat∞.

(2) Let p : X → S be a coCartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, classiﬁed by a map χ : S →

d

Cat∞. Then p

d

is a topos ﬁbration if and only if χ factors through LTop ⊆

Cat∞.

Corollary 6.3.1.8. For every simplicial set S, there is a canonical bijection

d

[S, LTop] ≃ [Sop, RTop]

d

where [K, C] denotes the collection of equivalence classes of objects of Fun(K, C). In particular, LTop and
RTopop are canonically isomorphic in the homotopy category of ∞-categories.

Proof. According to Proposition 6.3.1.7, both [S, LTop] and [Sop, RTop] can be identiﬁed with the collection
of equivalence classes of topos ﬁbrations X → S.

The following proposition is a simple reformulation of some of the results of §5.5.6.

Proposition 6.3.1.9. Let f∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism between ∞-topoi, having a left adjoint f ∗.
Then f ∗ and f∗ carry k-truncated objects to k-truncated objects and k-truncated morphisms to k-truncated
morphisms, for any integer k ≥ −2. Moreover, there is a (canonical) equivalence of functors f ∗τ Y
≤kf ∗.
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows immediately from Lemma 5.5.6.15, since f∗ and f ∗ are both left-exact.
The second follows from Proposition 5.5.6.28.

≤k ≃ τ X

Deﬁnition 6.3.1.10. Let X and Y be ∞-topoi. We let Fun∗(X, Y) denote the full subcategory of Fun(X, Y)
spanned by geometric morphisms f∗ : X → Y, and Fun∗(Y, X) the full subcategory of Fun(Y, X) spanned by
their left adjoints.

Remark 6.3.1.11. According to Proposition 5.2.6.2, the ∞-categories Fun∗(X, Y) and Fun∗(Y, X) are canon-
ically anti-equivalent to one another.

Warning 6.3.1.12. If X and Y are ∞-topoi, then the ∞-category Fun∗(X, Y) of geometric morphisms from
X to Y is not necessarily small, or even equivalent to a small ∞-category. This phenomenon is familiar in
classical topos theory. For example, there is a classifying topos A for abelian groups, having the property
that for any topos X, the category C of geometric morphisms X → A is equivalent to the category of abelian
group objects of X. This category is almost never small (for example, when X is the topos of sets, C is
equivalent to the category of abelian groups).

In spite of Warning 6.3.1.12, the ∞-category of geometric morphisms between two ∞-topoi can be

reasonably controlled:

Proposition 6.3.1.13. Let X and Y be ∞-topoi. Then the ∞-category Fun∗(Y, X) of geometric morphisms
from X to Y is accessible.

478

Proof. For each regular cardinal κ, let Yκ denote the full subcategory of Y spanned by κ-compact objects.
Choose a regular cardinal κ such that Y is κ-accessible and Yκ is stable under ﬁnite limits in Y. We may
therefore identify Y with Indκ(C), where C is a minimal model for Yκ. According to Proposition 5.3.5.10,
composition with the Yoneda embedding j : C → Y induces an equivalence from the ∞-category of κ-
continuous functors Funκ(Y, X) to the ∞-category Fun(C, X). We now make the following observations:

(1) A functor F : Y → X preserves all small colimits if and only if F ◦ j : C → X preserves κ-small colimits

(Proposition 5.5.1.9).

(2) A colimit-preserving functor F : Y → X is left exact if and only if the composition F ◦ j : C → X is left

exact (Proposition 6.1.5.2).

Invoking Proposition 5.2.6.2, we deduce that the ∞-category Fun∗(Y, X) is equivalent to the full subcat-
egory M ⊆ XC consisting of functors which preserve κ-small colimits and ﬁnite limits. Proposition 5.4.4.3
implies that Fun(C, X) is accessible. For every κ-small (ﬁnite) diagram p : K → C, the full subcategory of
Fun(C, X) which preserve colimits (limits) of p is an accessible subcategory of Fun(C, X) (Example 5.4.7.9).
Up to isomorphism, there are only a bounded number of κ-small (ﬁnite) diagrams in C. Consequently, M
is an intersection of a bounded number of accessible subcategories of Fun(C, X), and therefore accessible by
(Proposition 5.4.7.10).

6.3.2 Colimits of ∞-Topoi

Our goal in this section is to construct colimits in the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi. According to Corollary
6.3.1.8, it will suﬃce construct limits in the ∞-category LTop.

Proposition 6.3.2.1. Let {Xα}α∈A be a collection of ∞-topoi, parametrized by a (small) set A. Then the
α : X → Xα is left exact and colimit
product X =
preserving. The corresponding geometric morphisms exhibit X as a product of the family {Xα}α∈A in the
∞-category LTop.

α∈A Xα is an ∞-topos. Moreover, each projection π∗

Q

Proof. Proposition 5.5.3.5 implies that X is presentable. It is clear that a diagram p : K ⊲ → X is a colimit if
α ◦ p : K ⊲ → Xα is a colimit diagram in Xα. Similarly, a diagram q : K ⊳ → X
and only if each composition π∗
is a limit if and only if each composition π∗
α ◦ q : K ⊳ → Xα is a limit diagram in Xα. Using criterion (2) of
Theorem 6.1.0.6, we deduce that X is an ∞-topos, and that each π∗
α preserves all limits and colimits that
exist in X. Choose a right adjoint πα

∗ : Xα → X to each π∗
α.

According to Theorem 4.2.4.1, the ∞-category X is a product of the family {Xα}α∈A in the ∞-category

Cat∞. Since LTop is a subcategory of

Cat∞, it will suﬃce to prove the following assertion:

d

• For every ∞-topos Y and every functor f ∗ : Y → X such that each of the composite functors Y → Xα

is left exact and colimit preserving, f ∗ is itself left exact and colimit preserving.

d

This follows immediately from the fact that limits and colimits are computed pointwise.

Proposition 6.3.2.2. Let

q′ ∗

X

X′

p′∗

p∗

Y′

q∗

/ Y

be a diagram of ∞-categories which is homotopy Cartesian (with respect to the Joyal model structure).
Suppose further that X, Y, and Y′ are ∞-topoi, and that p∗ and q∗ are left exact and colimit preserving.
Then X′ is an ∞-topos. Moreover, for any ∞-topos Z and any functor f ∗ : Z → X, f ∗ is left exact and
colimit preserving if and only if the compositions p′∗ ◦ f ∗ and q′∗ ◦ f ∗ are left exact and colimit preserving.
In particular (taking f ∗ = idX), the functors p′∗ and q′∗ are left exact and colimit preserving.

Proof. The second claim follows immediately from Lemma 5.4.5.5 and the dual result concerning limits. To
prove the ﬁrst, we observe that X′ is presentable by Proposition 5.5.3.12. To show that X is an ∞-topos, it
will suﬃce to show that it satisﬁes criterion (2) of Theorem 6.1.0.6. This follows immediately from Lemma
5.4.5.5, given that X and Y′ satisfy criterion (2) of Theorem 6.1.0.6.

Proposition 6.3.2.3. The ∞-category LTop admits small limits, and the inclusion functor LTop ⊆
preserves small limits.

Cat∞

Proof. According to Proposition 4.4.2.6, it suﬃces to prove this result for pullbacks and small products. In
the case of products, we apply Proposition 6.3.2.1. For pullbacks, we use Proposition 6.3.2.2 and Theorem
4.2.4.1.

d

6.3.3 Filtered Limits of ∞-Topoi

We now consider the problem of computing limits in the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi. This is quite a bit
more diﬃcult than the analogous problem for colimits, because the inclusion functor i : RTop ⊆
Cat∞ does
not commute with limits in general. However, the inclusion i does commute with ﬁltered limits:

Theorem 6.3.3.1. The ∞-category RTop admits small ﬁltered limits (that is, limits indexed by diagrams
Cop → RTop where C is a small, ﬁltered ∞-category). Moreover, the inclusion RTop ⊆
Cat∞ preserves
small, ﬁltered limits.

d

The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 6.3.3.1. Our basic strategy is to mimic
Cat∞) of a ﬁltered diagram of
the proof of Theorem 5.5.3.18. Our ﬁrst step is to show that the limit (in
∞-topoi is itself an ∞-topos. This is equivalent to a more concrete assertion:
if p : X → S is a topos
ﬁbration, and Sop is a small, ﬁltered ∞-category, then the ∞-category C of Cartesian sections of p is an
d
∞-topos. We saw in Proposition 5.5.3.17 that C is an accessible localization of the ∞-category MapS(S, X)
spanned by all sections of p. Our ﬁrst step will be to show that MapS(S, X) is an ∞-topos. For this, the
hypothesis that Sop is ﬁltered is irrelevant.

d

Lemma 6.3.3.2. Let p : X → S be a topos ﬁbration, where S is a small simplicial set. The ∞-category
MapS(S, X) of sections of p is an ∞-topos.

Proof. This is a special case of Proposition 5.4.7.11.

Proposition 6.3.3.3. Let A be a (small) ﬁltered partially ordered set, and let p : X → N(A) be a topos
ﬁbration. Let C = MapN(A)(N(A), X) be the ∞-category of sections of p, and let C′ ⊆ C be the full subcategory
of C spanned by the Cartesian sections of p. Then C′ is a topological localization of C.

Proof. Let us say that a subset A′ ⊆ A is dense if there exists α ∈ A such that

{β ∈ A : β ≥ α} ⊆ A′.

For each morphism f in C, let A(f ) ⊆ A be the collection of all α ∈ A such that the image of f in Xα is an
equivalence. Let S be the collection of all monomorphisms f in C such that A(f ) is dense. It is clear that
S is stable under pullbacks, so that S−1 C is a topological localization of C. To complete the proof, it will
suﬃce to show that C′ = S−1 C.

We ﬁrst claim that each object of C′ is S-local. Let f : C → C′ belong to S, and let D ∈ C′. Choose α0
such that A(f ) contains A′ = {β ∈ A : β ≥ α0}, and let R∗ denote a right adjoint to the restriction functor

R : MapN(A)(N(A), X) → MapN(A)(N(A′), X).

480

According to Proposition 4.3.2.17, the essential image of R∗ consists of those functors E : N(A) → X which
are p-right Kan extensions of E| N(A′). We claim that D satisﬁes this condition. In other words, we claim
that for each α ∈ A, the map

q : N(A′′)⊳ → N(A) D→ X
is a p-limit, where A′′ = {β ∈ A : β ≥ α, β ≥ α0}. Since q carries each edge of N(A′′)⊳ to a p-Cartesian edge
of X, it suﬃces to verify that the simplicial set N(A′′) is weakly contractible (Proposition 4.3.1.12). This
follows immediately from the observation that A′′ is a ﬁltered partially ordered set.

We may therefore suppose that D = R∗D, where D = D| N(A′) is a Cartesian section of the induced map

p′ : X ×N(A) N(A′) → N(A′). We wish to prove that composition with f induces a homotopy equivalence

MapC(C′, R∗D) → MapC(C, R∗D).

This follows immediately from the fact that R and R∗ are adjoint, since R(f ) is an equivalence.

We now show that every S-local object of C belongs to C′. Let C ∈ C be a section of p which is S-local.

Choose α ≤ β in A, and let

Xα

F /
G

/Xβ

denote the (adjoint) functors associated to the (co)Cartesian ﬁbration p : X → N(A). The section C gives
rise to a pair of objects Cα ∈ Xα, Cβ ∈ Xβ, and a morphism φ : Cα → Cβ in the ∞-category X. The map
φ induces a morphism u : Cα → GCβ in Xα, which is well-deﬁned up to equivalence. We wish to show that
φ is p-Cartesian, which is equivalent to the assertion that u is an equivalence in Xα. Equivalently, we wish
to show that for each object P ∈ Xα, composition with u induces a homotopy equivalence

We may identify P with a diagram

MapXα (P, Cα) → MapXα (P, GCβ ).

and we can choose D′ to be a p-left Kan extension of D′|{β}.

Proposition 4.3.2.17 implies that for every object E ∈ C, the restriction maps

MapC(D, E) → MapXα (P, E(α))
MapC(D′, E) → MapXβ (F (P ), E(β))
are equivalences. In particular, the equivalence between D(β) and F (P ) induces a morphism θ : D′ → D.

We have a commutative diagram in the homotopy category H:

The vertical maps are homotopy equivalences, and the the horizontal map on the lower right is a homotopy
equivalence because F and G are adjoint. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the upper
horizontal map is an equivalence. Since C is S-local, it will suﬃce to show that θ ∈ S.

Let β ≤ β′, and consider the diagram

D′(β) w′

D′(β′)

θ(β)

in the ∞-category X. Since D′ is a p-left Kan extension of D′|{β}, we conclude that w′ is p-coCartesian.
Similarly, since D is a p-left Kan extension of D|{α}, we conclude that v and w ◦ v are p-coCartesian. It
follows that w is p-coCartesian as well (Proposition 2.4.1.7). Since θ(β) is an equivalence by construction,
we conclude that θ(β′) is an equivalence. Thus A(θ) ⊆ A is dense.

It remains only to show that θ is a monomorphism. For this, it suﬃces to show that θ(γ) is an monomor-
phism in Xγ for each γ ∈ A. If γ ≥ β, this follows from the above argument. Suppose γ (cid:3) β. Since D′ is a
p-left Kan extension of D′|{β} over N(A), we conclude that D′(γ) is a p-colimit of the empty diagram, and
therefore an initial object of Xγ. It follows that any map D′(γ) → D(γ) is a monomorphism.

Proposition 6.3.3.4. Let A be a (small) ﬁltered partially ordered set, let p : X → N(A)op, and let Y ⊆
MapN(A)(N(A), X) be the full subcategory spanned by the Cartesian sections of p. For each α ∈ A, the
evaluation map π∗ : Y → Xα is a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi.

Proof. Let A′ = {β ∈ A : α ≤ β}. Using Theorem 4.1.3.1, we conclude that the inclusion N(A′) ⊆ N(A) is
coﬁnal. Corollary 3.3.3.2 implies that the restriction map

MapN(A)(N(A), X) → MapN(A)(N(A′), X)

induces an equivalence on the full subcategories spanned by Cartesian sections. Consequently, we are free
to replace A by A′ and thereby assume that α is a least element of A.

The functor π∗ factors as a composition

Y φ∗→ MapN(A)(N(A), X)

ψ∗→ Xα

where φ∗ denotes the inclusion functor and ψ∗ the evaluation functor. Proposition 6.3.3.3 implies that φ∗ is
a geometric morphism; it therefore suﬃces to show that ψ∗ is a geometric morphism as well.

Let ψ∗ be a left adjoint to ψ∗ (the existence of ψ∗ follows from Proposition 4.3.2.17, as indicated below).
We wish to show that ψ∗ is left exact. According to Proposition 5.1.2.2, it will suﬃce to show that the
composition

θ : Xα

ψ∗
→ MapN(A)(N(A), X)

eβ→ Xβ,

is left exact, where eβ denotes the functor given by evaluation at β.

Let f : ∆1 → N(A) be the edge joining α to β, let C be the ∞-category of coCartesian sections of p, and
let C′ be the ∞-category of coCartesian sections of the induced map p′ : X ×N(A) ∆1 → ∆1. We observe that
C consists precisely of those sections s : N(A) → X of p which are p-left Kan extensions of s|{α}. Applying
Proposition 4.3.2.15, we conclude that the evaluation map eα : C → Xα is a trivial ﬁbration, and that (by
Proposition 4.3.2.17) we may identify ψ∗ with the composition

where q is a section of eα| C. Let q′ : Xα → C′ be the composition of q with the restriction map C → C′.
Then θ can be identiﬁed with the composition

which is the functor Xα → Xβ associated to f : α → β by the coCartesian ﬁbration p. Since p is a topos
ﬁbration, θ is left exact as desired.

Let G be a proﬁnite group and let X be a set with a continuous action of G. Then we can recover X as
the direct limit of the ﬁxed point sets X U , where U ranges over the collection of open subgroups of G. Our
next result is an ∞-categorical analogue of this observation.

Lemma 6.3.3.5. Let p : X → S⊲ be a Cartesian ﬁbration of simplicial sets, which is classiﬁed by a colimit
diagram S⊲ → Catop

∞, and let s : S⊲ → X be a Cartesian section of p. Then s is a p-colimit diagram.

Proof. In virtue of Corollary 3.3.1.2, we may suppose that S is an ∞-category. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we
must show that the map Xs/ → Xs/ induces an equivalence of ∞-categories when restricted to the inverse
image of the cone point of S⊲. Fix an object x ∈ X lying over the cone point of S⊲. Let f : S⊲ → X be
the constant map with value x, and let f = f |S. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the
restriction map

θ : MapFun(S⊲,X)(s, f ) → MapFun(S,X)(s, f )

is a homotopy equivalence. To prove this, choose a p-Cartesian transformation α : g → f , where g : S⊲ → X is
a section of p (automatically Cartesian). Let g = g|S and let α : g → f be the associated transformation. Let
C be the full subcategory of MapS⊲ (S⊲, X) spanned by the Cartesian sections of p, and let C ⊆ MapS⊲ (S, X)
be deﬁned similarly. We have a commutative diagram in the homotopy category H

Proposition 2.4.4.2 implies that the vertical maps are homotopy equivalences, and Proposition 3.3.3.1 implies
that θ′ is a homotopy equivalence (since the restriction map C → C is an equivalence of ∞-categories). It
follows that θ is a homotopy equivalence as well.

Lemma 6.3.3.6. Let p : X → S be a presentable ﬁbration, let C be the full subcategory of MapS(S, X)
spanned by the Cartesian sections of p. For each vertex s of S, let ψ(s)∗ : C → Xs be the functor given by
evaluation at s, and let ψ(s)∗ be a left adjoint to ψ(s)∗. There exists a diagram θ : S → Fun(C, C) with the
following properties:

(1) For each vertex s of S, θ(s) is equivalent to the composition ψ(s)∗ ◦ ψ(s)∗.

(2) The identity functor idC is a colimit of θ in the ∞-category of functors Fun(C, C).

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that p extends to a presentable ﬁbration p : X → S⊲,
which is classiﬁed by colimit diagram S⊲ → PrL (and therefore by a colimit diagram S⊲ → Catop
∞, in virtue
of Theorem 5.5.3.18). Let C be the ∞-category of Cartesian sections of p, so that we have trivial ﬁbrations

C ← C → X∞,

where X∞ = X ×S⊲ {∞}, and ∞ denotes the cone point of S⊲. For each vertex s of S⊲, we let ψ(s)∗ : C → X s
be the functor given by evaluation at s, and ψ(s)∗ a left adjoint to ψ(s)∗. To complete the proof, it will
suﬃce to construct a map θ′ : S → Fun(C, X∞) with the following properties:

(1′) For each vertex s of S, θ′(s) is equivalent to the composition ψ(∞)∗ ◦ ψ(s)∗ ◦ ψ(s)∗.

(2′) The functor ψ(∞)∗ is a colimit of θ′.

Let e : C × S⊲ → X be the evaluation map. Choose an p-coCartesian natural transformation e → e′,
where e′ is a map from C × S⊲ to X∞. Lemma 6.3.3.5 implies that for each object X ∈ C, the restriction
e|{X} × S⊲ is an p-colimit diagram in X. Applying Proposition 4.3.1.9, we deduce that e′|{X} × S⊲ is a
colimit diagram in X∞. According to Proposition 5.1.2.2, e′ determines a colimit diagram S⊲ → Fun(C, X∞).
Let θ′ be the restriction of this diagram to S. Then the colimit of θ′ can be identiﬁed with e′|C × {∞},
which is equivalent to e|C × {∞} = ψ(∞)∗. This proves (2′). To verify (1′), we observe that e′|C × {s}
can be identiﬁed with the composition of ψ(s)∗ = e|C × {s} with the functor Xs → X∞ associated to the
coCartesian ﬁbration p, which can in turn be identiﬁed with ψ(∞)∗ ◦ ψ(s)∗ (both are left adjoints to the
pullback functor X∞ → Xs associated to p).

Proposition 6.3.3.7. Let A be a (small) ﬁltered partially ordered set, let p : X → N(A), and let Y ⊆
MapN(A)(N(A), X) be the full subcategory spanned by the Cartesian sections of p. Let Z be an ∞-topos, and
π∗ : Z → Y an arbitrary functor. Suppose that, for each α ∈ A, the composition

Z π∗→ Y → Xα

is a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. Then π∗ is a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi.
Proof. Let π∗ denote a left adjoint to π∗. Since π∗ commutes with colimits, Lemma 6.3.3.6 implies that π∗
can be written as the colimit of a diagram q : N(A) → ZY having the property that for each α ∈ A, q(α)
is equivalent to π∗ψ(α)∗ψ(α)∗, where ψ(α)∗ denotes the evaluation functor at α and ψ(α)∗ its left adjoint.
Each composition π∗ψ(α)∗ is left adjoint to the geometric morphism ψ(α)∗π∗, and therefore left exact. It
follows that q(α) is left exact. Since ﬁltered colimits in Z are left exact (Example 7.3.4.7), we conclude that
the functor π∗ is left exact, as desired.

Proof of Theorem 6.3.3.1. Let C be a small, ﬁltered ∞-category, and let q : Cop → RTop be an arbitrary
diagram. Choose a limit q : (C⊲)op →
Cat∞. We must show that q factors
Cat∞ of q in the ∞-category
through RTop, and is a limit diagram in RTop.

d

Using Proposition 5.3.1.16, we may assume without loss of generality that C is the nerve of a ﬁltered
partially ordered set A. Let p : X → N(A)op be the topos ﬁbration classiﬁed by q (Proposition 6.3.1.7).
Then the image of the cone point of (C⊲)op under q is equivalent to the ∞-category X of Cartesian sections
of p (Corollary 3.3.3.2). It follows from Proposition 6.3.3.3 that X is an ∞-topos. Moreover, Proposition
6.3.3.4 ensures that for each α ∈ A, the evaluation map X → Xα is a geometric morphism. This proves that
q factors through RTop. To complete the proof, we must show that q is a limit diagram in RTop. Since
RTop is a subcategory of
Cat∞, this reduces immediately to the statement
of Proposition 6.3.3.7.

6.3.4 General Limits of ∞-Topoi

d

d

Our goal in this section is to construct general limits in the ∞-category RTop. Our strategy is necessarily
rather diﬀerent from that of §6.3.3, because the inclusion i : RTop →
Cat does not preserve limits in general.
In fact, i does not even preserve the ﬁnal object:
Proposition 6.3.4.1. Let X be an ∞-topos. Then Fun∗(S, X) is a contractible Kan complex. In particular,
S is a ﬁnal object in the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi.

d

Proof. We observe that S ≃ Shv(∆0) where the ∞-category ∆0 is endowed with the “discrete” topology (so
that the empty sieve does not constitute a cover of the unique object). According to Proposition 6.2.3.20,
the ∞-category Fun∗(S, X) is equivalent to the full subcategory of X ≃ Fun(∆0, X) spanned by those objects
X ∈ X which correspond to left exact functors ∆0 → X. It is clear that these are precisely the ﬁnal objects
of X, which form a contractible Kan complex (Proposition 1.2.12.9).

To construct limits in general, we ﬁrst develop some tools for describing ∞-topoi via “generators and
relations”. This will allow us to reduce the construction of limits in RTop to the problem of constructing
colimits in Cat∞.

Lemma 6.3.4.2. Let C be a small ∞-category, κ a regular cardinal, and suppose given a (small) collection of
κ-small diagrams {f α : K ⊲
α → C}α∈A. Then there exists a functor F : C → D with the following properties:

(1) The ∞-category D is small and admits κ-small colimits.

(2) For each α ∈ A, the induced map F ◦ f α : K ⊲
(3) Let E be an arbitrary ∞-category which admits κ-small colimits. Let Fun′(D, E) denote the full subcat-
egory of Fun(D, E) spanned by those functors which preserve κ-small colimits. Then composition with
F induces a fully faithful embedding

α → C is a colimit diagram.

θ : Fun′(D, E) → Fun(C, E).

The essential image of θ consists those functors F ′ : C → E such that each F ′ ◦ f α is a colimit diagram
in E.

Proof. Let j : C → P(C) denote the Yoneda embedding. For each α ∈ A, let fα = f α|Kα, and let Cα ∈ C
denote the image of the cone point under f α. Let Dα ∈ P(C) denote a colimit of the induced diagram j ◦ fα,
so that j ◦ f α induces a map sα = Dα → j(Cα). Let S = {sα}α∈A, let X denote the localization S−1 P(C),
and let L : P(C) → X denote a left adjoint to the inclusion. Let D′ be the smallest full subcategory of X that
contains the essential image of the functor L ◦ j and is stable under κ-small colimits, let D be a minimal
model for D′, and let F : C → D denote the composition of L ◦ j with a retraction of D′ onto D. It follows
immediately from the construction that D satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2).

We observe that for each α ∈ A, the domain and codomain of sα are both κ-compact objects of P(C). It
follows that X is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits in P(C). Corollary 5.5.7.3 implies that L carries κ-compact
objects of P(C) to κ-compact objects of X. Since the collection of κ-compact objects of X is stable under
κ-small colimits, we conclude that D′ consists of κ-compact objects of X. Invoking Proposition 5.3.5.11, we
deduce that the inclusion D ⊆ X determines an equivalence Indκ(D) ≃ X.

We now prove (3). We observe that there exists a fully faithful embedding i : E → E′ which preserves
κ-small colimits, where E′ admits arbitrary small colimits (for example, we can take E′ = Fun(E,
S)op and i
to be the Yoneda embedding). Replacing E by E′ if necessary, we may assume that E itself admits arbitrary
small colimits. We have a homotopy commutative diagram

5.1.5.6 implies that the right vertical arrow is an equivalence. It will therefore suﬃce to show that θ′ is fully
faithful, and that the essential image of θ′ consists of those colimit-preserving functors F ′ from P(C) to
E such that F ′ ◦ j ◦ f α is a colimit diagram, for each α ∈ A. This follows immediately from Proposition
5.5.4.20.

Deﬁnition 6.3.4.3. Let Catlex

(1) A small ∞-category C belongs to Catlex

(2) Let f : C → D be a functor between small ∞-categories which admit ﬁnite limits. Then f is a morphism

in Catlex

∞ if and only if f preserves ﬁnite limits.

Proof. Let p : J → Catlex
∞ be a small diagram, which carries each vertex j ∈ J to an ∞-category Cj. Let C be
a colimit of the diagram p in Cat∞, and for each j ∈ J, let φj : Cj → C be the associated functor. Consider
the collection of all isomorphism classes of diagrams {f : K ⊳ → C}, where K is a ﬁnite simplicial set and
the map f admits a factorization

K ⊳ f0→ Cj

φj→ C,

where f0 is a limit diagram in Cj. Invoking the dual of Lemma 6.3.4.2, we deduce the existence of a functor
F : C → D with the following properties:

(1) The ∞-category D is small and admits ﬁnite limits.

(2) Each of the compositions F ◦ φj is left exact.

(3) For every ∞-category E which admits ﬁnite limits, composition with F induces an equivalence from the
full subcategory of Fun(D, E) spanned by the left exact functors to the full subcategory of Fun(C, E)
spanned by those functors F ′ : C → E such that each F ′ ◦ φj is left exact.

It follows that that D can be identiﬁed with a colimit of the diagram p in the ∞-category Catlex
∞ .

Lemma 6.3.4.5. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits, and let f∗ : X → P(C) be a
geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. Then there exists a small ∞-category D which admits ﬁnite limits, a left
exact functor f ′′ : C → D such that f∗ is equivalent to the composition,

X f ′

∗→ P(D)

f ′′
∗→ P(C)

where f ′

∗ is a fully faithful geometric morphism and f ′′

∗ is given by composition with f ′′.

Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that X is minimal. Let f ∗ be a left adjoint to f∗. Choose
a regular cardinal κ large enough that the composition

C jC→ P(C)

f ∗
→ X

carries each object C ∈ C to a κ-compact object of X. Enlarging κ if necessary, we may assume that X is
κ-accessible and that the collection of κ-compact objects is stable under ﬁnite limits (Proposition 5.4.7.4).
Let D be the collection of κ-compact objects of X. The proof of Proposition 6.1.5.3 shows that the inclusion
D ⊆ X can be extended to a left exact localization functor f ′∗ : P(D) → X.

Using Theorem 5.1.5.6, we conclude that the composition jD ◦ f ∗ ◦ jC : C → P(D) can be extended to
a colimit-preserving functor f ′′∗ : P(C) → P(D), and that f ′∗ ◦ f ′′∗ is homotopic to f ∗. Proposition 6.1.5.2
implies that f ′′∗ is left exact. It follows that f ′∗ and f ′′∗ admit right adjoints f ′
∗ with the desired
properties.

(b) Let S−1 X and T −1 Y be left exact localizations of X and Y, respectively. Let U be the smallest strongly

Using Corollary 6.2.1.3, we deduce that U is generated by a (small) set of morphisms in W. It follows
that the diagram

localization of P(C). Using (a), we can reduce to the case where Z = P(C). Using (b) and Lemma 6.3.4.5, we
can reduce to the case where X = P(D) for some small ∞-category D which admits ﬁnite limits, and g∗ is
induced by composition with a left exact functor g : C → D. Similarly, we can assume that f∗ is determined

object, and pullbacks. The existence of ﬁltered limits follows from Theorem 6.3.3.1, the existence of a ﬁnal
object follows from Proposition 6.3.4.1, and the existence of pullbacks follows from Proposition 6.3.4.6.

Remark 6.3.4.8. Our construction of ﬁber products in RTop is somewhat inexplicit. We will later give a
more concrete construction in the case of ordinary products; see §7.3.3.

We conclude this section by proving a companion result to Corollary 6.3.4.7. First, a few general remarks.
The ∞-category RTop is most naturally viewed as an ∞-bicategory, since we can consider also noninvertible
natural transformations between geometric morphisms. Correspondingly, we can consider a more general
theory of ∞-bicategorical limits in RTop. While we do not want to give any precise deﬁnitions, we would
like to point out Corollary 6.3.4.7 can be generalized to show that RTop admits all (small) ∞-bicategorical
limits. In more concrete terms, this just means that RTop is cotensored over Cat∞ in the following sense:
Proposition 6.3.4.9. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let D be a small ∞-category. Then there exists an ∞-topos
Mor(C, X) and a functor e : C → Fun∗(Mor(C, X), X) with the following universal property:
(∗) For every ∞-topos Y, composition with e induces an equivalence of ∞-categories

Fun∗(Y, Mor(C, X)) → Fun(C, Fun∗(Y, X)).

Proof. We ﬁrst treat the case where X = P(D), where D is a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits.
Using Lemma 6.3.4.2, we conclude that there exists a functor e0 : Cop × D → D′ with the following properties:

(1) The ∞-category D′ is small and admits ﬁnite limits.

(2) For each object C ∈ C, the induced functor

D ≃ {C} × D ⊆ Cop × D e0→ D′

is left exact.

(3) Let E be an arbitrary ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits. Then composition with e0 induces
an equivalence from full subcategory of Fun(D′, E) spanned by the left exact functors to the full
subcategory of Fun(Cop × D, E) spanned by those functors which restrict to left-exact functors {C} ×
D → E, for each C ∈ C.

In this case, we can deﬁne Mor(C, X) to be P(D′), and e : C → Fun∗(P(D′), P(D)) to be given by composition
with e0; the universal property (∗) follows immediately from Theorem 5.1.5.6 and Proposition 6.1.5.2.

In the general case, we invoke Proposition 6.1.5.3 to reduce to the case where X = S−1 X′ is an accessible
left-exact localizaton of an ∞-topos X′, where X′ ≃ P(D) is as above so that we can construct an ∞-topos
Mor(C, X′) and a map e′ : C → Fun∗(Mor(C, X′), X′) satisfying the condition (∗). For each C ∈ C, let e′(C)∗
denote the corresponding geometric morphism from Mor(C, X′) to X′, let e′(C)∗ denote a left adjoint to
e′(C)∗, and let S(C) = e′(C)∗S be the image of S in the collection of morphisms of Mor(C, X′). Since each
e′(C)∗ is a colimit-preserving functor, each of the sets S(C) is generated under colimits by a small collection
of morphisms in Mor(C, X′). Let T be the smallest collection of morphisms in Mor(C, X′) which is strongly
saturated, stable under pullbacks, and contains each of the sets SC. Using Corollary 6.2.1.3, we conclude that
T is generated (as a strongly saturated class of morphisms) by a small collection of morphisms in Mor(C, X′).
It follows that Mor(C, X) = T −1 Mor(C, X′) is an ∞-topos. By construction, the map e′ restricts to give a
functor e : C → Fun∗(Mor(C, X), X). Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we see that e has the desired properties.

sponding to the subcategory RTop ⊆

´Etale Morphisms of ∞-Topoi

Let f : X → Y be a continuous map of topological spaces. We say that f is ´etale (or a local homeomorphism)
if, for every point x ∈ X, there exist open sets U ⊆ X containing x and V ⊆ Y containing f (x) such that
f induces a homeomorphism U → V . Let F denote the sheaf of sections of f : that is, F is a sheaf of sets
on Y such that for every open set V ⊆ Y , F(V ) is the set of all continuous maps s : V → X such that
f ◦ s = id : V → Y . The construction (f : X → Y ) 7→ F determines an equivalence of categories, from the
category of topological spaces which are ´etale over Y to the category of sheaves (of sets) on Y . In particular,
we can recover the topological space X (up to homeomorphism) from the sheaf of sets F on Y . For example,
we can reconstruct the category ShvSet(X) of sheaves on X as the overcategory ShvSet(Y )/ F.

Our goal in this section is to develop an analogous theory of ´etale morphisms in the setting of ∞-topoi.
Suppose given a geometric morphism f∗ : X → Y. Under what circumstances should we say that f∗ is
´etale? By analogy with the case of topological spaces, we should expect that an ´etale morphism determines
a “sheaf” on Y: that is, an object U of the ∞-category Y. Moreover, we should then be able to recover the
∞-category X as an overcategory Y/U . The following result guarantees that this expectation is somewhat
reasonable:

Proposition 6.3.5.1. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let U be an object of X.

(1) The ∞-category X/U is an ∞-topos.

(2) The projection π! : X/U → X has a right adjoint π∗ which commutes with colimits. Consequently, π∗

itself has a right adjoint π∗ : X/U → X, which is a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi.

Proof. The existence of a right adjoint π∗ to the projection π! : X/U → X follows from the assumption that
X admits ﬁnite limits. Moreover, the assertion that π∗ preserves colimits is a special case of the assumption
that colimits in X are universal. This proves (2).

To prove (1), we will show that X/U satisﬁes criterion (2) of Theorem 6.1.0.6. We ﬁrst observe that
X/U is presentable (Proposition 5.5.3.10). Let K be a small simplicial set, and let α : p → q be a natural
transformation of diagrams p, q : K ⊲ → X/U . Suppose that q is a colimit diagram, and that α = α|K is a
Cartesian transformation. The projection π! preserves all colimits (since it is a left adjoint), so that π! ◦ q
is a colimit diagram in X. Since π! preserves pullback squares (Proposition 4.4.2.9), π! ◦ α is a Cartesian
transformation. By assumption, X is an ∞-topos, so that Theorem 6.1.0.6 implies that π! ◦ p is a colimit
diagram if and only if π! ◦ α is a Cartesian transformation. Using Propositions 4.4.2.9 and 1.2.13.8, we
conclude that p is a colimit diagram if and only if α is a Cartesian transformation, as desired.

A geometric morphism f∗ : X → Y of ∞-topoi is said to be ´etale if it arises via the construction of

Proposition 6.3.5.1; that is, if f admits a factorization

X f ′

∗→ Y/U

f ′′
∗→ Y

where U is an object of Y, f ′
f ′′∗ : Y → Y/U . We note that in this case, f ∗ has a left adjoint f! = f ′′
limits, not just ﬁnite limits.

∗ is a categorical equivalence, and f ′′

∗ is a right adjoint to the pullback functor
∗. Consequently, f ∗ preserves all

! ◦ f ′

Remark 6.3.5.2. Given an ´etale geometric morphism f : X/U → X of ∞-topoi, the description of the
pushforward functor f∗ is slightly more complicated than that of f! (which is merely the forgetful functor)
or f ∗ (which is given by taking products with U ). Given an object p : X → U of X/U , the pushforward f∗X
is an object of X which represents the functor “sections of p”.

The collection of ´etale geometric morphisms contains all equivalences and is stable under composition.
Consequently, we can consider the subcategory RTop´et ⊆ RTop containing all objects of RTop, whose
morphisms are precisely the ´etale geometric morphisms. Our goal in this section is to study the ∞-category
RTop´et. Our main results are the following:

489

(a) If X is an ∞-topos containing an object U , then the associated ´etale geometric morphism π∗ : X/U → X
can be described by a universal property. Namely, X/U is universal among ∞-topoi Y with a geometric
morphism φ∗ : Y → X such that φ∗U admits a global section (Proposition 6.3.5.5).

(b) There is a simple criterion for testing whether a geometric morphism π∗ : X → Y is ´etale. Namely,
π∗ is ´etale if and only if the functor π∗ admits a left adjoint π!, the functor π! is conservative, and an
appropriate push-pull formula holds in the the ∞-category Y (Proposition 6.3.5.11).

U0

(c) Given a pair of topological spaces X0 and X1 and a homeomorphism φ : U0 ≃ U1 between open
subsets U0 ⊆ X0 and U1 ⊆ X1, we can “glue” X0 to X1 along φ to obtain a new topological space
X1. Moreover, the topological space X contains open subsets homeomorphic to X0 and
X = X0
X1. In the setting of ∞-topoi, it is possible to make much more general “gluing” constructions of
the same type. We can formulate this idea more precisely as follows: given any diagram {Xα} in the
∞-category RTop´et having a colimit X in RTop, each of the associated geometric morphisms Xα → X
is ´etale (Theorem 6.3.5.13). Using this fact, we will show that the ∞-category RTop´et admits small
colimits.

`

Remark 6.3.5.3. We will say that a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi f ∗ : Y → X is ´etale if and only if
its right adjoint f∗ : X → Y is ´etale. We let LTop´et denote the subcategory of LTop spanned by the ´etale
geometric morphisms, so that there is a canonical equivalence RTop´et ≃ LTopop
´et .

Our ﬁrst step is to obtain a more precise formulation of the universal property described in (a):

Deﬁnition 6.3.5.4. Let f ∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. Let U be an object of X and
α : 1Y → f ∗U a morphism in Y, where 1Y denotes a ﬁnal object of Y. We will say that α exhibits Y as a
classifying ∞-topos for sections of U if, for every ∞-topos Z, the diagram

Fun∗(Y, Z)

◦f ∗

Fun∗(X, Z)

φ

Z∗

φ0

/ Z

is a homotopy pullback square of ∞-categories. Here Z∗ denotes the ∞-category of pointed objects of Z
(that is, the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, Z) spanned by morphisms f : Z → Z ′ where Z is a ﬁnal object of
Z), and the morphisms φ and φ0 are given by evaluation on α and U , respectively.

Let X be an ∞-topos containing an object U . It follows immediately from the deﬁnition that a classifying
∞-topos for sections of U is uniquely determined up to equivalence, provided that it exists. For the existence,
we have the following result:

Proposition 6.3.5.5. Let X be an ∞-topos containing an object U , let π! : X/U → X be the projection map,
and let π∗ : X → X/U be a right adjoint to π!. Let 1U denote the identity map from U to itself, regarded as a
(ﬁnal) object of X/U , and let α : 1U → π∗U be adjoint to the identity map π!1U ≃ U . Then α exhibits X/U
as a classifying ∞-topos for sections of U .

Before giving the proof of Proposition 6.3.5.5, we summarize some of the pleasant consequences.

Corollary 6.3.5.6. Let X be an ∞-topos containing an object U , and let π∗ : X → X/U be the corresponding
´etale geometric morphism. For every ∞-topos Z, composition with π∗ induces a left ﬁbration

Moreover, the ﬁber over a geometric morphism φ∗ : X → Z is homotopy equivalent to the mapping space
MapZ(1Z, φ∗U ).

Fun∗(X/U , Z) → Fun∗(X, Z).

Remark 6.3.5.7. Corollary 6.3.5.6 implies in particular the existence of homotopy ﬁber sequences

MapZ(1Z, φ∗U ) → MapLTop(X/U , Z) → MapLTop(X, Z)

(where the ﬁber is taken over a geometric morphism φ∗ ∈ MapLTop(X, Z)).

Suppose that Z = X/V , and that φ∗ is a right adjoint to the projection X/V → Z. We then deduce the

existence of a canonical homotopy equivalence

MapX(V, U ) ≃ MapZ(1Z, φ∗U ) ≃ MapLTopX /

(X/U , X/V ).

Remark 6.3.5.8. It follows from Remark 6.3.5.7 that if f ∗ : X → Y is a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi
and U ∈ X is an object, then the induced diagram

X

is a pushout square in LTop.

in LTopop, where g∗ is ´etale. Then f∗ is ´etale if and only if h∗ is ´etale.

Proof. The “only if” direction is obvious. To prove the converse, let us suppose that g∗ and h∗ are both
´etale, so that we have equivalences X ≃ Z/U and U ≃ Z/V for some pair of objects U, V ∈ Z. Using Remark
6.3.5.7, we deduce that the morphism f∗ is determined by a map U → V in Z, which we can identify with
an object V ∈ Y such that X ≃ Y/V .
Remark 6.3.5.10. Let X be an ∞-topos. The projection map

p : Fun(∆1, X) → Fun({1}, X) ≃ X

is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Moreover, for every morphism α : U → V in X, the associated functor α∗ : X/V →
X/U is an ´etale geometric morphism of ∞-topoi, so that p is classiﬁed by a functor χ0 : Xop → LTop´et. The
functor χ0 carries the ﬁnal object of X to an ∞-topos equivalent to X, and therefore factors as a composition

Xop χ

→ (LTop´et)X / → LTop´et .

The argument of Remark 6.3.5.7 shows that χ is fully faithful, and it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions
that χ is essentially surjective. Corollary 6.3.5.9 allows us to identify (LTop´et)X / with the full subcategory
of LTopX / spanned by the ´etale geometric morphisms f ∗ : X → Y. Consequently, we can regard χ as a fully
faithful embedding of X into the ∞-category (LTopop)/ X of ∞-topoi over X, whose essential image consists
of those ∞-topoi which are ´etale over X.

Let α0 be a morphism from 1U ∈ X/U to 1X ∈ X in M (so that α0 is determined uniquely up to homotopy).
We observe that there is a retraction r : M → X/U which restricts to π∗ on X ⊆ M, and we can identify α
with r(α0).

Let Z be an arbitrary ∞-topos. Let C be the full subcategory of Fun(M, Z) spanned by those functors

F : M → Z with the following properties:

(a) The restriction F | X/U : X/U → Z preserves small colimits and ﬁnite limits.

(b) The functor F is a left Kan extension of F | X/U . In other words, F carries p-Cartesian morphisms in

M to equivalences in Z.

Proposition 4.3.2.15 implies that the restriction map C → Fun∗(X/U , Z) is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. Moreover,
this trivial Kan ﬁbration has a section given by composition with r. It will therefore suﬃce to show that the
diagram

Z∗

Fun∗(X, Z)

/ Z

is a homotopy pullback square. In other words, we wish to show that restriction along α0 and the inclusion
X ⊆ M induce a categorical equivalence C → Z∗ ×Z Fun∗(X, Z).
We deﬁne simplicial subsets M′′ ⊆ M′ ⊆ M as follows:

(i) Let M′′ ≃ X

{1} ∆1 be the union of X with the 1-simplex of M corresponding to the morphism α0.

(ii) Let M′ be the full subcategory of M spanned by X together with the object 1U .

`

We can identify Z∗ ×Z Fun∗(X, Z) with the full subcategory C′′ ⊆ Fun(M′′, Z) spanned by those functors

F satisfying the following conditions:

(a′) The restriction F | X preserves small colimits and ﬁnite limits.

(b′) The object F (1U ) is ﬁnal in Z.
Let C′ be the full subcategory of Fun(M′, Z) spanned by those functors which satisfy (a′) and (b′). To
complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the restriction maps

C u→ C′ v→ C′′

are trivial Kan ﬁbrations.

We ﬁrst show that u is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. In view of Proposition 4.3.2.15, it will suﬃce to prove the

following:

(∗) A functor F : M → Z satisﬁes (a) and (b) if and only if it satisﬁes (a′) and (b′), and F is a right Kan

extension of F | M′.

To prove the “only if” direction, let us suppose that F satisﬁes (a) and (b). Without loss of generality, we
may suppose F = F0 ◦ r, where F0 = F | X/U . Then F | X = F0 ◦ π∗. Since F0 and π∗ both preserve small
colimits and ﬁnite limits, we deduce (a′). Condition (b′) is an immediate consequence of (a). We must show
that F is a right Kan extension of F | X. Unwinding the deﬁnitions (and applying Corollary 4.1.3.1), we are
reduced to showing that for every object V ∈ X/U corresponding to a morphism V → U in X, the diagram

is a pullback square in Z. Since F = F0 ◦ r and F0 preserves ﬁnite limits, it suﬃces to show that the square

V

1U

π∗V

/ π∗U

is a pullback square in X/U . In view of Proposition 1.2.13.8, it suﬃces to observe that the square

V

U

V × U

/ U × U

is a pullback in X.

Now let us suppose that F is a right Kan extension of F1 = F | M′, and that F1 satisﬁes conditions (a′)
and (b′). We ﬁrst claim that F satisﬁes (b). In other words, we claim that for every object V ∈ X, the
canonical map F (π∗V ) → F (V ) is an equivalence. Consider the diagram

F (π∗V )

F (V × U )

/ F (V )

F (1U )

/ F (U )

/ F (1X).

Since F is a right Kan extension of F1, the left square is a pullback. Since F1 satisﬁes (a), the right square
is a pullback. Therefore the outer square is a pullback. Condition (b′) implies that the lower horizontal
composition is an equivalence, so the upper horizontal composition is an equivalence as well.

We now prove that F satisﬁes (a). Condition (b′) implies that the functor F0 = F | X/U preserves ﬁnal
objects. It will therefore suﬃce to show that F0 preserves small colimits and pullback squares. Since F is a
right Kan extension of F1, the functor F0 can be described by the formula

V 7→ F (π!V ) ×F (U) F (1U ).

It therefore suﬃces to show that the functors π!, F | X, and •×F (U)F (1U ) preserve small colimits and pullback
squares. For π!, this follows from Propositions 1.2.13.8 and 4.4.2.9. For F | X, we invoke assumption (a′).
For the functor • ×F (U) F (1U ), we invoke our assumption that Z is an ∞-topos (so that colimits in Z are
universal). This completes the veriﬁcation that u is a trivial Kan ﬁbration.

To complete the proof, we must show that the functor v is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. We note that v ﬁts

into a pullback diagram

C′

Fun(M′, Z)

v

v′

C′′

/ Fun(M′′, Z).

It will therefore suﬃce to show that v′ is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. Since Z is an ∞-category, we need only
show that the inclusion M′′ ⊆ M′ is a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets. This is a special case of
Proposition 3.2.2.7.

We next establish the recognition principle promised in (b):

Proposition 6.3.5.11. Let f ∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. Then f ∗ is ´etale if and only
if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The functor f ∗ admits a left adjoint f! (in view of Corollary 5.5.2.9, this is equivalent to the assumption

that f ∗ preserves small limits).

(2) The functor f! is conservative. That is, if α is a morphism in Y such that f!α is an equivalence in X,

then α is an equivalence in Y.

(3) For every morphism X → Y in X, every object Z ∈ Y, and every morphism f!Z → Y , the induced

diagram

f!(f ∗X ×f ∗Y Z)

f!Z

X

/ Y

is a pullback square in X.

Remark 6.3.5.12. Condition (3) of Proposition 6.3.5.11 can be regarded as a push-pull formula: it provides
a canonical equivalence

f!(f ∗X ×f ∗Y Z) ≃ X ×Y f!Z.
In particular, when Y is ﬁnal in X, we have an equivalence f!(f ∗X × Z) ≃ X × f!Z: in other words, the
functor f! is “linear” with respect to the action of X on Y.

Proof of Proposition 6.3.5.11. Suppose ﬁrst that f ∗ is an ´etale geometric morphism. Without loss of gen-
erality, we may suppose that Y = X/U , and that f ∗ is right adjoint to the forgetful functor f! : X/U → X.
Assertions (1) and (2) are obvious, and assertion (3) follows from the observation that, for every diagram

X → Y ← Z → U,

the induced map (X × U ) ×Y ×U Z → X ×Y Z is an equivalence in X.

For the converse, let us suppose that (1), (2) and (3) are satisﬁed. We wish to show that f ∗ is ´etale. Let
f!→ X/U . To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show
U = f!1Y. Let F denote the composition Y ≃ Y/1Y
that F is an equivalence of ∞-categories. Proposition 5.2.5.1 implies that F admits a right adjoint G, given
by the formula

(X → U ) 7→ f ∗X ×f ∗U 1Y.

Assumption (3) guarantees that the counit map v : F G → idX/U is an equivalence. To complete the
proof, it suﬃces to show that for each Y ∈ Y, the unit map uY : Y → GF Y is an equivalence. The map
F uY : F Y → F GF Y has a left homotopy inverse (given by vF Y ) which is an equivalence, so that F uY is
an equivalence. It follows that f!uY is an equivalence, so that uY is an equivalence by virtue of assumption
(2). Thus G is a homotopy inverse to F , so that F is an equivalence of ∞-categories as desired.

Our ﬁnal goal in this section is to prove the following result:

Theorem 6.3.5.13. The ∞-category RTop´et admits small colimits, and the inclusion RTop´et ⊆ RTop
preserves small colimits.

The proof of Theorem 6.3.5.13 is rather technical and will occupy our attention for the remainder of this
section. However, the analogous result is elementary if we work with ∞-topoi which are assume to be ´etale
over a ﬁxed base X. In this case, Theorem 6.3.5.13 can be reduced (with the aid of Remark 6.3.5.10) to the
following assertion:

Proposition 6.3.5.14. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let χ : X → LTopop
Then χ preserves small colimits.

/ X be the functor of Remark 6.3.5.10.

Proof of Theorem 6.3.5.13. As a ﬁrst step, we establish the following:

(∗) Suppose given a small diagram p : K → LTopop and a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi φ∗ : lim
−→

(p) → Y.
Suppose further that for each vertex v in K, the induced geometric morphism φ(v)∗ : p(v) → Y is ´etale.
Then φ∗ is ´etale.

To prove (∗), we note that φ∗ determines a functor p : K → LTopop
Remark 6.3.5.10 implies that p factors as a composition

/ Y lifting p. Since each φ(v)∗ is ´etale,

K

Let U ∈ Y be a colimit of the diagram q. Then Corollary 6.3.5.9 implies that lim

(p) ≃ Y/U , so that φ∗ is

We now return to the proof of Theorem 6.3.5.13. Using Proposition 4.4.3.2 and its proof, we can reduce

the proof to the following special cases:

(a) The ∞-category LTopop

´et admits small coproducts, and the inclusion LTopop

´et ⊆ LTopop preserves small

coproducts.

(b) The ∞-category LTopop

´et admits coequalizers, and the inclusion LTopop

´et ⊆ LTopop preserves coequalizer

diagrams.

We ﬁrst prove (a). In view of (∗), it will suﬃce to prove the following:

(a′) Let {Xα} be a small collection of ∞-topoi, and let X be their coproduct in LTopop (so that we
α Xα). Then each of the associated geometric morphisms

have an equivalence of ∞-categories X ≃
φ∗
α : X → Xα is ´etale.

Q

To prove (a′), we may assume without loss of generality that X =
α is given by projection
onto the corresponding factor. The desired result then follows from the criterion of Proposition 6.3.5.11
(more concretely: let let U ∈ X be an object whose image in Xα is a ﬁnal object Uα ∈ Xα, and whose image
in Xβ is an initial object Uβ ∈ Xβ for β 6= α. Then X/U ≃

β(Xβ)/Uβ ≃ Xα.)
To prove (b), we can again invoke (∗) to reduce to the following assertion:

´et , having colimit X in LTopop. Then the induced geometric morphism φ∗ : X0 → X is ´etale.
To prove (b′), we identify the diagram in question with a functor p : I → LTopop, and I with the
subcategory of N(∆)op spanned by the objects {[0], [1]} and injective maps of linearly ordered sets. Let X•
be the simplicial object of LTopop given by left Kan extension along the inclusion I ⊆ N(∆)op, so that each
Xn is equivalent to a coproduct (in LTopop) of X0 with n copies of Y. Using (∗) and Corollary 6.3.5.9, we
deduce that X• is a simplicial object in LTopop
´et . Consequently, assertion (b′) is an immediate consequence
of Lemma 4.3.2.7 and the following:

(b′′) Let X• be a simplicial object of LTopop

´et , and let X be its geometric realization in LTopop. Then the

induced geometric morphism φ∗ : X0 → X is ´etale.

The proof of (b′′) is based on the following Lemma, whose proof we defer until the end of this section:

Lemma 6.3.5.15. Suppose given a simplicial object X• in LTopop

(3) The induced map of geometric realizations (in LTopop) is an equivalence | X• | → | X′

• |.

Using Lemma 6.3.5.15, we can reduce the proof of (b′′) to the special case where X• is a groupoid object

of LTopop. The diagram

N(∆)op X•→ LTopop

´et ⊆

Cat

op
∞

is classiﬁed by a Cartesian ﬁbration q : Z → N(∆)op. Here we can identify Xn with the ﬁber Z[n] =
Z ×N(∆)op{[n]}, and every map of linearly ordered sets α : [m] → [n] induces a geometric morphism α∗ :
Z[m] → Z[n]. Since the geometric morphism α∗ is ´etale, it admits a left adjoint α!, so that q is also a
coCartesian ﬁbration (Corollary 5.2.2.4).

d

It follows from Propositions 6.3.2.3 and 3.3.3.1 that we can identify X with the full subcategory of
FunN(∆)op(N(∆)op, Z) spanned by the Cartesian sections of q; under this identiﬁcation, the pullback functor
φ∗ corresponds to the functor X → Z[0] ≃ X0 given by evaluation at [0].

Let 1X denote a ﬁnal object of X, which we regard as a section of q. Let T : N(∆)op → N(∆)op denote
the shift functor [n] 7→ [n] ⋆ [0], and let β0 : T → idN(∆)op denote the evident natural transformation. Let
β : (1X ◦ T ) → U• be a natural transformation in Fun(N(∆)op, Z) lifting β which is q-coCartesian. Since X•
is a groupoid object of LTopop
´et , we deduce that U• is a Cartesian section of q, which we can identify with
an object of X.

Let S = N(∆)op × ∆1, so that β0 deﬁnes a map S → N(∆)op. Let Z′ = Z ×N(∆)opS and let βS = β,
regarded as a section of of the projection q′ : Z′ → S. Let Z′′ = Z′/βS (see §4.2.2 for an explanation of this
notation). Let q′′ : Z′′ → S. The ﬁbers of q′′ can be described as follows:

• The ﬁber of q′′ over ([n], 0) can be identiﬁed with Z

/1Z[n+1]
[n+1] ≃ Z[n+1].

• The ﬁber of q′′ over ([n], 1) can be identiﬁed with Z/Un

[n] ≃ Z[n+1].

d

Proposition 4.2.2.4 implies that the projection q′′ : Z′′ → S is a coCartesian ﬁbration, classiﬁed by a map χ :
Cat∞. The above description shows that χ can be regarded as an equivalence from χ0 = χ| N(∆)op ×{0}
S →
to χ1 = χ| N(∆)op × {1} in the ∞-category of simplicial objects of
Cat∞. Moreover, the functor χ0 classiﬁes
the pullback of the coCartesian ﬁbration q by the translation map T : N(∆)op → N(∆op), so that χ0 and
χ1 factor through LTopop
´et . Lemma 6.1.3.17 implies that the colimit of χ0 (hence also of χ1) in LTopop
is canonically equivalent to X0. On the other hand, Propositions 3.3.3.1 and 6.3.2.3 allow us to identify
(χ1) with the ∞-category of Cartesian sections of the projection Z′′ ×S(N(∆)op × {1}) → N(∆)op, which
lim
−→
is isomorphic to X/U• as a simplicial set. We now complete the proof by observing that the resulting
identiﬁcation X0 ≃ X/U• is compatible with the projection φ∗ : X0 → X.

d

The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of Lemma 6.3.5.15. We ﬁrst need to introduce a

bit of notation. We begin with a few remarks about the behavior of ∞-topoi under change of universe.

Notation 6.3.5.16. Let X be an ∞-topos and C an arbitrary ∞-category. We let ShvC(X) denote the full
subcategory of Fun(Xop, C) spanned by those functors which preserve small limits. We will refer to ShvC(X)
as the ∞-category of C-valued sheaves on X.

Remark 6.3.5.17. Let X be an ∞-topos. Proposition 5.5.2.2 implies that the Yoneda embedding X →

and let e : Fun´et(∆1, LTop) → LTop be given by evaluation at the vertex {0} ∈ ∆1. Since the collection of

We deﬁne a simplicial set K equipped with a projection p : K → LTop so that the following universal

Then K is an ∞-category, whose objects can be identiﬁed with pairs (X, FX), where X is an ∞-topos and

ﬁbration, and that a morphism (X, FX) → (Y, FY) is p-Cartesian if and only if, for every object U ∈ X, the
canonical map FX(X/U ) → FY(Y/f ∗U ) is a homotopy equivalence, where f ∗ denotes the underlying geometric

(b) For every morphism [m] → [n] in ∆, the induced map Xn → Xm has essentially κ-small homotopy

Let X be the geometric realization of X•. Then the induced map X0 → X has essentially κ-small homotopy

Proof. Replacing X by one of its connected components X ′ (and each Xn by the inverse image X ′ ×X Xn),
we may suppose that X is connected.

Let R ⊆ π0X0 × π0X0 denote the image of π0X1, and let ∼ denote the equivalence relation on π0X0
generated by R. It follows from assumption (b) that for every κ-small subset A ⊆ π0X0, the intersections
R ∩ (A × π0X0) and R ∩ (π0X0 × A) are again κ-small. Since κ is uncountable, it follows that the every
∼-equivalence class is κ-small. Since (π0X0)/ ∼ is isomorphic to π0X ≃ ∗, we conclude that π0X is itself
κ-small. Combining this with (a), we conclude that X0 is essentially κ-small. Invoking (b), we deduce that
each Xn is essentially κ-small, so that X is essentially κ-small. The desired conclusion now follows from the
long exact sequences associated to the ﬁbration sequences X0 ×X {∗} → X0 → X.

For each n ≥ 0 and each object U ∈ Y, we can identify Gn(U ) with the maximal Kan complex contained

that each connected component of Gn(U ) is essentially small. Moreover, for every morphism [m] → [n] in
∆, the induced map β : Gn(U ) → Gm(U ) is induced by composition with an ´etale geometric morphism
g∗ : Xm → Xn, so that the homotopy ﬁbers of β are essentially small by Remark 6.3.5.7. The desired result
now follows from Lemma 6.3.5.27.

6.3.6 Structure Theory for ∞-Topoi

In this section we will analyze the following question: given a geometric morphism f : X → Y of ∞-topoi,
when is f an equivalence? Clearly, this is true if and only if the pullback functor f ∗ is both fully faithful
and essentially surjective. It is useful to isolate and study these conditions individually.

Deﬁnition 6.3.6.1. Let f : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. The image of f is deﬁned to be
the smallest full subcategory of X which contains f ∗ Y and is stable under small colimits and ﬁnite limits.
We will say that f is algebraic if the image of f coincides with X.

Our ﬁrst goal is to prove that the image of a geometric morphism is itself an ∞-topos.

Proposition 6.3.6.2. Let f : X → Z be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi, and let Y be the image of f .
Then Y is an ∞-topos. Moreover, the inclusion Y ⊆ X is left exact and colimit-preserving, so we have obtain
a factorization of f as a composition of geometric morphisms

where h is algebraic and g∗ is fully faithful.

X g

→ Y h→ Z

Proof. We will show that Y satisﬁes the ∞-categorical versions of Giraud’s axioms (see Theorem 6.1.0.6).
Axioms (ii), (iii), and (iv) are concerned with the interaction between colimits and ﬁnite limits. Since X
satisﬁes these axioms, and Y ⊆ X is stable under the relevant constructions, Y automatically satisﬁes these
axioms as well. The only nontrivial point is to verify (i), which asserts that Y is presentable.

Choose a small collection of objects {Zα} which generate Z under colimits. Now choose an uncountable

regular cardinal τ with the following properties:

(1) Each f ∗(Zα) is a τ -compact object of X.

(2) The ﬁnal object 1X is τ -compact.

(3) The limits functor Fun(Λ2

2, X) → X (a right adjoint to the diagonal functor) is τ -continuous and

preserves τ -compact objects.

Let Y′ be the collection of all objects of Y which are τ -compact when considered as objects of X. Clearly,
each object of Y′ is also τ -compact when regarded as an object of Y. Moreover, because X is accessible, Y′
is essentially small. It will therefore suﬃce to prove that Y′ generates Y under colimits.

Choose a minimal model Y′

compact objects is essentially small, so that Y′

0 for Y. Since X is accessible, the full subcategory Xκ spanned by the κ-
0 is small. According to Proposition 5.3.5.10, there exists a

503

τ -continuous functor F : Indτ (Y′
0) → X whose composition with the Yoneda embedding is equivalent to the
inclusion Y′
0) is presentable. Proposition 5.3.5.11 implies
that F is fully faithful; let Y′′ be its essential image. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that
Y′′ = Y.

0 admits τ -small colimits, Indτ (Y′

0 ⊆ X. Since Y′

Since Y is stable under colimits in X, we have Y′′ ⊆ Y. According to Proposition 5.5.1.9, F preserves small
colimits, so that Y′′ is stable under small colimits in X. By construction, Y′′ contains each f ∗(Zα). Since
f ∗ preserves colimits, we conclude that Y′′ contains f ∗ Z. By deﬁnition Y is the smallest full subcategory of
X which contains f ∗ Z and is stable under small colimits and ﬁnite limits. It remains only to show that Y′′
is stable under ﬁnite limits. Assumption (2) guarantees that Y′′ contains the ﬁnal object of X, so we need
only show that Y′′ is stable under pullbacks. Consider a diagram p : Λ2
2 → Y′′. The proof of Proposition
5.4.4.3 (applied with K = Λ2
2 and κ = ω) shows that p can be written as a τ -ﬁltered colimit of diagrams
2 → Y′′. Since ﬁltered colimits in X are left exact (Example 7.3.4.7), we conclude that the limit of p
pα : Λ2
can be obtained as a τ -ﬁltered colimit of limits of the diagrams pβ. In view of assumption (3), each of these
limits lies in Y′, so that the limit of p lies in Y′′ as desired.

Remark 6.3.6.3. The factorization of Proposition 6.3.6.2 is unique up to (canonical) equivalence.

The terminology of Deﬁnition 6.3.6.1 is partially justiﬁed by the following observations:

Proposition 6.3.6.4.

(1) Every ´etale geometric morphism between ∞-topoi is algebraic.

(2) The collection of algebraic geometric morphisms of ∞-topoi is stable under ﬁltered limits (in RTop).

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (1). Let X be an ∞-topos, let U be an object of X, let π! : X/U → X be the projection
functor, and let π∗ be a left adjoint to π!. Let f : X → U be an object of X/U , and let F : f → idU be a
morphism in X/U (uniquely determined up to equivalence; for example, we can take F to be the composition
of f with a retraction ∆1 × ∆1 → ∆1). Let g : F → π∗π!F be the unit map for the adjunction between
π∗ and π!. We claim that g is a pullback square in X/U . According to Proposition 4.4.2.9, it will suﬃce to
verify that the image of g under π! is a pullback square in X. But this square can be identiﬁed with

X

/ U × U,

which is easily shown to be Cartesian. It follows that, in X/U , f can be obtained as a ﬁber product of the
ﬁnal object with objects that lie in the essential image of π∗. It follows that π∗ X generates X/U under ﬁnite
limits, so that π is algebraic.

To prove (2), we consider a geometric morphism f : X → Y which is a ﬁltered limit of algebraic geometric
morphisms {fα : Xα → Yα} in the ∞-category Fun(∆1, RTop). Let X′ ⊆ X be a full subcategory which is
stable under ﬁnite limits, small colimits, and contains f ∗ Y. We wish to prove that X′ = X. For each α, we
have a diagram of ∞-topoi

Remark 6.3.6.5. It is possible to formulate a converse to Proposition 6.3.6.4. Namely, one can characterize
the class of algebraic morphisms as the smallest class of geometric morphisms which contains all ´etale
morphisms and is stable under certain kinds of ﬁltered limits. However, it is necessarily to allow limits which
are parametrized not just by ﬁltered ∞-categories, but ﬁltered stacks over ∞-topoi. The precise statement
requires ideas which lie outside the scope of this book.

Having achieved a rudimentary understanding of the class of algebraic geometric morphisms, we now turn

our attention to the opposite extreme: namely, geometric morphisms f : X → Y where f ∗ is fully faithful.

Proposition 6.3.6.6. Let f : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. Suppose that f ∗ is fully faithful
and essentially surjective on 1-truncated objects. Then f ∗ is essentially surjective on n-truncated objects for
all n.

The proof uses ideas which will be introduced in §6.5.1 and §7.2.2.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may identify Y with the essential image of f ∗. We use induction on
n. The result is obvious for n = 1. Assume that n > 1, and let X be an n-truncated object of X. By the
inductive hypothesis, U = τ≤n−1X belongs to Y. Replacing X and Y by X/U and Y/U , we may suppose that
X is n-connective.

We observe that πnX is an abelian group object of the ordinary topos Disc(X/X ). Since X is 2-connective,
Proposition 7.2.1.13 implies that the pullback functor Disc(X) → Disc(X/X ) is an equivalence of categories.
We may therefore identify πnX with an abelian group object A ∈ Disc(X). Since A is discrete, it belongs to
Y. It follows that the Eilenberg-MacLane object K(A, n + 1) belongs to Y. Since X is an n-gerb banded by
A, Theorem 7.2.2.26 implies the existence of a pullback diagram

X

1X

1X

/ K(A, n + 1).

Since Y is stable under pullbacks in X, we conclude that X ∈ Y as desired.

Corollary 6.3.6.7. Let f : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. Suppose that f ∗ is fully faithful and
essentially surjective on 1-truncated objects, and that X is n-localic (see §6.4.5). Then f is an equivalence
of ∞-topoi.

Remark 6.3.6.8. In the situation of Corollary 6.3.6.7, one can eliminate the hypothesis that X is n-localic
in the presence of suitable ﬁnite-dimensionality assumptions on X and Y; see §7.2.1.

Remark 6.3.6.9. Let X be an n-localic ∞-topos, and let Y be the 2-localic ∞-topos associated to the
2-topos τ≤1 X, so that we have a geometric morphism f : X → Y. It follows from Corollary 6.3.6.7 that
f is algebraic. Roughly speaking, this tells us that there is only a very superﬁcial interaction between the
theory of k-categories and “topology”, for k > 2. On the other hand, this statement fails dramatically if
k = 1: the relationship between an ordinary topos and its underlying locale is typically very complicated,
and not algebraic in any reasonable sense. It is natural to ask what happens when k = 2. In other words,
does Proposition 6.3.6.6 remain valid if f ∗ is only assumed to be essentially surjective on discrete objects?
An aﬃrmative answer would indicate that our theory of ∞-topoi is a relatively modest extension of classical
topos theory. A counterexample could be equally interesting, if it were to illustrate a nontrivial interaction
between higher category theory and geometry.

6.4 n-Topoi

Roughly speaking, an ordinary topos is a category which resembles the category of sheaves of sets on a
topological space X. In §6.1, we introduced the deﬁnition of an ∞-topos. In the same rough terms, we
can think of an ∞-topos as an ∞-category which resembles the ∞-category of sheaves of ∞-groupoids on
a topological space X. Phrased in this way, it is natural to guess that these two notions have a common
generalization. In §6.4.1, we will introduce the notion of an n-topos, for every 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. The idea is
that an n-topos should be an n-category which resembles the n-category of sheaves of (n − 1)-groupoids
on a topological space X. Of course, there are many approaches to making this idea precise. Our main
result, Theorem 6.4.1.5, asserts that several candidate deﬁnitions are equivalent to one another. The proof
of Theorem 6.4.1.5 will occupy our attention for most of this section. In §6.4.3, we study an axiomatization of
the class of n-topoi in the spirit of Giraud’s theorem, and in §6.4.4 we will give a characterization of n-topoi
based on their descent properties. The case of n = 0 is somewhat exceptional, and merits special treatement.
In §6.4.2 we will show that a 0-topos is essentially the same thing as a locale (a mild generalization of the
notion of a topological space).

Our main motivation for introducing the deﬁnition of an n-topos is that it allows us to study ∞-topoi and
topological spaces (or, more generally, 0-topoi) in the same setting. In §6.4.5, we will introduce constructions
which allow us to pass back and forth between m-topoi and n-topoi, for any 0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ ∞. We introduce
an ∞-category TopR
n can be regarded as a localization
of the ∞-category RTop. In other words, the study of n-topoi for n < ∞ can be regarded as a special case
of the theory of ∞-topoi.

6.4.1 Characterizations of n-Topoi

In this section, we will introduce the deﬁnition of n-topos for 0 ≤ n < ∞. In view of Theorem 6.1.0.6, there
are several reasonable approaches to the subject. We will begin with extrinsic approach.

Deﬁnition 6.4.1.1. Let 0 ≤ n < ∞. An ∞-category X is an n-topos if there exists a small ∞-category C
and an (accessible) left exact localization

L : P≤n−1(C) → X,

where P≤n−1(C) denotes the full subcategory of P(C) spanned by the (n − 1)-truncated objects.

Remark 6.4.1.2. The accessibility condition on the localization functor L : P≤n−1(C) → X of Deﬁnition
6.4.1.1 is superﬂuous: we will show that such left exact localization of P≤n−1(C) is automatically accessible
(combine Proposition 6.4.3.9 with Corollary 6.2.1.7).

Remark 6.4.1.3. An ∞-category X is a 1-topos if and only if it is equivalent to the nerve of an ordinary
(Grothendieck) topos; this follows immediately from characterization (B) of Proposition 6.1.0.1.

Remark 6.4.1.4. Deﬁnition 6.4.1.1 makes sense also in the case n = −1, but is not very interesting. Up to
equivalence, there is precisely one (−1)-topos: the ﬁnal ∞-category ∗.

Our main goal is to prove the following result:

Theorem 6.4.1.5. Let X be a presentable ∞-category and let 0 ≤ n < ∞. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) There exists a small n-category C which admits ﬁnite limits, a Grothendieck topology on C, and an
equivalence of X with the full subcategory of Shv≤n−1(C) ⊆ Shv(C) consisting of (n − 1)-truncated
objects of Shv(C).

(2) There exists an ∞-topos Y and an equivalence X → τ≤n−1 Y.

506

(3) The ∞-category X is an n-topos.

(4) Colimits in X are universal, X is equivalent to an n-category, and the class of (n − 2)-truncated mor-

phisms in X is local ( see §6.1.3 ).

(5) Colimits in X are universal, X is equivalent to an n-category, and for all suﬃciently large regular
cardinals κ, there exists an object of X which classiﬁes (n−2)-truncated, relatively κ-compact morphisms
in X.

(6) The ∞-category X satisﬁes the following n-categorical versions of Giraud’s axioms:

(i) The ∞-category X is equivalent to a presentable n-category.
(ii) Colimits in X are universal.
(iii) If n > 0, then coproducts in X are disjoint.
(iv) Every n-eﬃcient (see §6.4.3) groupoid object of X is eﬀective.

Proof. The case n = 0 will be analyzed very explicitly in §6.4.2; let us therefore restrict our attention to the
case n > 0. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) is obvious (take Y = Shv(C)). Suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Without
loss of generality, we may suppose that Y is an (accessible) left exact localization of P(C) for some small
∞-category C. Then X is a left-exact localization of P≤n−1(C), which proves (3).

We next prove the converse (3) ⇒ (2). We ﬁrst observe that P≤n−1(C) = Fun(Cop, τ≤n−1 S). Let hn C be
the underlying n-category of C, as in Proposition 2.3.4.12. Since τ≤n−1 S is equivalent to an n-category, we
conclude that composition with the projection C → hnC induces an equivalence P≤n−1(hnC) → P≤n−1(C).
Consequently, we may assume without loss of generality (replacing C by hnC if necessary) that there is an
accessible left exact localization L : P≤n−1(C) → X, where C is an n-category. Let S be the collection of
all morphisms u in P≤n−1(C) such that Lu is an equivalence, so that S is of small generation. Let S be
the strongly saturated class of morphisms in P(C) generated by S. We observe that τ −1
≤n−1(S) is a strongly
saturated class of morphisms containing S, so that S ⊆ τ −1
≤n−1(S). It follows that S−1 P≤n−1(C) is contained
−1 P(C), and may therefore be identiﬁed with the collection of (n − 1)-truncated objects of Y. To
in Y = S
complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that Y is an ∞-topos. For this, it will suﬃce to show that S is
stable under pullbacks. Let T be the collection of all morphisms f : X → Y in P(C) such that for every
pullback diagram

X ′

f ′

Y ′

X

f

/ Y

the morphism f ′ belongs to S. It is easy to see that T is strongly saturated; we wish to show that T ⊆ S.
It will therefore suﬃce to prove that S ⊆ T . Let us therefore ﬁx f : X → Y belonging to S, and let D be
the full subcategory of P(C) spanned by those objects Y ′ such that for any pullback diagram

X ′

f ′

Y ′

X

f

/ Y,

f ′ belongs to S. Since colimits in P(C) are universal and S is stable under colimits, we conclude that D is
stable under colimits in P(C). Since P(C) is generated under colimits by the essential image of the Yoneda
embedding j : C → P(C), it will suﬃce to show that j(C) ∈ D for each C ∈ C. We now observe that
P≤n−1(C) ⊆ D (since S is stable under pullbacks in P≤n−1(C)), and that j(C) ∈ P≤n−1(C) in virtue of our
assumption that C is an n-category.

The implication (2) ⇒ (4) will be established in §6.4.4 (Propositions 6.4.4.6 and 6.4.4.7). The proof
of Theorem 6.1.6.8 adapts without change to show that (4) ⇔ (5). The implication (4) ⇒ (6) will be
proven in §6.4.4 (Proposition 6.4.4.9). Finally, the “diﬃcult” implication (6) ⇒ (1) will be proven in §6.4.3
(Proposition 6.4.3.6), using an inductive argument quite similar to the proof of Giraud’s original result.

Remark 6.4.1.6. Theorem 6.4.1.5 is slightly stronger than its ∞-categorical analogue, Theorem 6.1.0.6:
it asserts that every n-topos arises as an n-category of sheaves on some n-category C equipped with a
Grothendieck topology.

Remark 6.4.1.7. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal. Then there exists a
regular cardinal κ such that every monomorphism is relatively κ-compact. In this case, characterization (5)
of Theorem 6.4.1.5 recovers a classical description of ordinary topos theory: a category X is a topos if and
only if it is presentable, colimits in X are universal, and X has a subobject classiﬁer.

6.4.2 0-Topoi and Locales

Our goal in this section is to prove Theorem 6.4.1.5 in the special case n = 0. A byproduct of our proof is
a classiﬁcation result (Corollary 6.4.2.6), which identiﬁes the theory of 0-topoi with the classical theory of
locales (Deﬁnition 6.4.2.3).

We begin by observing that when n = 0, a morphism in an ∞-category X is (n − 2)-truncated if and only
if it is an equivalence. Consequently, any ﬁnal object of X is an (n − 2)-truncated morphism classiﬁer, and
the class of (n − 2)-truncated morphisms is automatically local (in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.1.3.8). Moreover,
if X is a 0-category then every groupoid object in X is equivalent to a constant groupoid, and therefore
automatically eﬀective. Consequently, characterizations (4) through (6) in Theorem 6.4.1.5 all reduce to the
same condition on X, and we may restate the desired result as follows:

Theorem 6.4.2.1. Let X be a presentable 0-category. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) There exists a small 0-category C which admits ﬁnite limits, a Grothendieck topology on C, and an

equivalence X → Shv≤−1(C).

(2) There exists an ∞-topos Y and an equivalence X → τ≤−1 Y.

(3) The ∞-category X is a 0-topos.

(4) Colimits in X are universal.

Before giving a proof of Theorem 6.4.2.1, it is convenient to reformulate condition (4). Recall that any
0-category X is equivalent to N(U), where U is a partially ordered set which is well-deﬁned up to canonical
isomorphism (see Example 2.3.4.3). The presentability of X is equivalent to the assertion that U is a complete
lattice: that is, every subset of U has a least upper bound in U (this condition formally implies the existence
of greater lower bounds, as well).

Remark 6.4.2.2. If n = 0, then every presentable n-category is essentially small. This is typically not true
for n > 0.

We note that the condition that colimits in X be universal can also be formulated in terms of the partially
ordered set U: it is equivalent to the assertion that meets in U commute with inﬁnite joins in the following
sense:

Deﬁnition 6.4.2.3. Let U be a partially ordered set. We will say that U is a locale if the following conditions
are satisﬁed:

(1) Every subset {Uα} of elements of U has a least upper bound

α Uα in U.

S

508

(2) The formation of least upper bounds commutes with meets, in the sense that

(Uα ∩ V ) = (

Uα) ∩ V.

(Here (U ∩ V ) denotes the greatest lower bound of U and V , which exists in virtue of assumption (1).)

Example 6.4.2.4. For every topological space X, the collection U(X) of open subsets of X forms a locale.
Conversely, if U is a locale, then there is a natural topology on the collection of prime ﬁlters of U which
allows us to extract from U a topological space. These two constructions are adjoint to one another, and in
good cases they are actually inverse equivalences. More precisely, the adjunction gives rise to an equivalence
between the category of spatial locales and the category of sober topological spaces. In general, a locale can
be regarded as a sort of generalized topological space, in which one may speak of open sets but one does not
generally have a suﬃcient supply of points. We refer the reader to [42] for details.

We can summarize the above discussion as follows:

Proposition 6.4.2.5. Let X be a presentable 0-category. Then colimits in X are universal if and only if X
is equivalent to N(U), where U is a locale.

We are now ready to give the proof of Theorem 6.4.2.1.

Proof. The implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) are easy. Suppose that (3) is satisﬁed, so that X is a left-exact
localization of P≤−1(C), for some small ∞-category C. Up to equivalence, there are precisely two (−1)-
truncated spaces: ∅ and ∗. Consequently, τ≤−1 S is equivalent to the two-object ∞-category ∆1. It follows
that P≤−1(C) is equivalent to Fun(Cop, ∆1).

Let

X denote the collection of sieves on C, ordered by inclusion. Then, identifying a a functor f : C → ∆1

with the sieve f −1{0} ⊆ C, we deduce that Fun(C, ∆1) is isomorphic to the nerve N(

X).

e

Without loss of generality, we may identify X with the essential image of a localization functor L : N(
X). The map L may be identiﬁed with a map of partially ordered sets from

X) →
X to itself. Unwinding the
N(
deﬁnitions, we ﬁnd that the condition that L be a left exact localization is equivalent to the following three
properties:

e

e

e

e

(A) The map L :

X →

X is idempotent.

(B) For each U ∈

X, U ⊆ L(U ).
e
e

(C) The map L :

X →
e

X preserves ﬁnite intersections (since X is a left exact localization of N(

X).)

Let U = {U ∈

X : LU = U }. Then it is easy to see that X is equivalent to the nerve N(U), and that the
partially ordered set X satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2) of Deﬁnition 6.4.2.3. Therefore U is a locale, so that
colimits in N(U) are universal by Proposition 6.4.2.5. This proves that (3) ⇒ (4).

e

e

e

e

Now suppose that (4) is satisﬁed. Using Proposition 6.4.2.5, we may suppose without loss of generality
that X = N(U), where U is a locale. We observe that X is itself small. Let us say that a sieve {Uα → U } on
an object U ∈ X is covering if

U =

Uα

α
[
in U. Using the assumption that U is a locale, it is easy to see that the collection of covering sieves determines
a Grothendieck topology on X. The ∞-category P≤−1(X) can be identiﬁed with the nerve of the partially
ordered set of all downward-closed subsets U0 ⊆ U. Moreover, an object of P≤−1(X) belongs to Shv≤−1(X)
if and only if the corresponding subset U0 ⊆ U is stable under joins. Every such subset U0 ⊆ U has a largest
element U ∈ U, and we then have an identiﬁcation U0 = {V ∈ U : V ≤ U }. It follows that Shv≤−1(X)
is equivalent to the nerve of the partially ordered set U, which is X. This proves (1), and concludes the
argument.

509

We may summarize the results of this section as follows:

Corollary 6.4.2.6. An ∞-category X is a 0-topos if and only if it is equivalent to N(U), where U is a locale.

Remark 6.4.2.7. Coproducts in a 0-topos are typically not disjoint.

In classical topos theory, there are functorial constructions for passing back and forth between topoi and
locales. Given a locale U (such as the locale U(X) of open subsets of a topological space X), one may deﬁne
a topos X of sheaves ( of sets ) on U. The original locale U may then be recovered as the partially ordered
set of subobjects of the ﬁnal object of X. In fact, for any topos X, the partially ordered set U of subobjects
of the ﬁnal object forms a locale. In general, X cannot be recovered as the category of sheaves on U; this is
true if and only if X is a localic topos: that is, if and only if X is generated under colimits by the collection
of subobjects of the ﬁnal object 1X. In §6.3 we will discuss a generalization of this picture, which will allow
us to pass between m-topoi and n-topoi for any m ≤ n.

6.4.3 Giraud’s Axioms for n-Topoi

In §6.1.1, we sketched an axiomatic approach to the theory of ∞-topoi. The axioms we introduced were
closely parallel to Giraud’s axioms for ordinary topoi, with one important diﬀerence. If X is an ∞-topos,
then every groupoid object of X is eﬀective. If X is an ordinary topos, then a groupoid U• is eﬀective only
if the diagram

U1

/ U0

exhibits U1 as an equivalence relation on U0. Our ﬁrst goal in this section is to formulate an analogue of
this condition, which will lead us to an axiomatic description of n-topoi for all 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞.

Deﬁnition 6.4.3.1. Let X be an ∞-category and U• a groupoid object of X. We will say that U• is
n-eﬃcient if the natural map

U1 → U0 × U0

(which is well-deﬁned up to equivalence) is (n − 2)-truncated.

Remark 6.4.3.2. By convention, we regard every groupoid object as ∞-eﬃcient.

Example 6.4.3.3. If C is (the nerve of) an ordinary category, then giving a 1-eﬃcient groupoid object U•
of C is equivalent to giving an object U0 of C and an equivalence relation U1 on U0.

Proposition 6.4.3.4. An ∞-category X is equivalent to an n-category if and only if every eﬀective groupoid
in X is n-eﬃcient.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that C is equivalent to an n-category. Let U• be an eﬀective groupoid in X. Then U•
has a colimit U−1. The existence of a pullback diagram

U1

U0

U0

/ U−1

implies that the map f ′ : U1 → U0 × U0 is a pullback of the diagonal map f : U−1 → U−1 × U−1. We wish
to show that f ′ is (n − 2)-truncated. By Lemma 5.5.6.12 it suﬃces to show that f is (n − 2)-truncated. By
Lemma 5.5.6.15, this is equivalent to the assertion that U−1 is (n − 1)-truncated. Since C is equivalent to
an n-category, every object of C is (n − 1)-truncated.

Now suppose that every eﬀective groupoid in X is n-eﬃcient. Let U ∈ X be an object; we wish to show
that U is (n − 1)-truncated. The constant simplicial object U• taking the value U is an eﬀective groupoid,
and therefore n-eﬃcient. It follows that the diagonal map U → U × U is (n − 2)-truncated. Lemma 5.5.6.15
implies that U is (n − 1)-truncated as desired.

We are now almost ready to supply the “hard” step in the proof of Theorem 6.4.1.5 (namely, the im-
plication (6) ⇒ (1)). We ﬁrst need a slightly technical lemma, whose proof requires routine cardinality
estimates.

Lemma 6.4.3.5. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal. There exists a regular
cardinal τ such that X is τ -accessible, and the full subcategory of Xτ ⊆ X spanned by the τ -compact objects
is stable under the formation of subobjects and ﬁnite limits.

Proof. Choose a regular cardinal κ such that X is κ-accessible. We observe that, up to equivalence, there are
a bounded number of κ-compact objects of X, and therefore a bounded number of subobjects of κ-compact
objects of X. Now choose an uncountable regular cardinal τ ≫ κ such that:

(1) The ∞-category Xκ is essentially τ -small.

(2) For each X ∈ Xκ and each monomorphism i : U → X, U is τ -compact.

It is clear that X is τ -accessible, and Xτ is stable under ﬁnite limits (in fact, κ-small limits) by Proposition
5.4.7.4. To complete the proof, we must show that Xτ is stable under the formation of subobjects. Let
i : U → X be a monomorphism, where X is τ -compact. Since X is κ-accessible, we can write X as the
colimit of κ-ﬁltered diagram p : J → Xκ. Since X is τ -compact, it is a retract of the colimit X ′ of some
τ -small subdiagram p| J′. Since τ is uncountable, we can use Proposition 4.4.5.12 to write X as the colimit
of a τ -small diagram Idem → X, which carries the unique object of Idem to X ′. Since colimits in X are
universal, it follows that U can be written as a τ -small colimit of a diagram Idem → X which takes the value
U ′ = U ×X X ′. It will therefore suﬃce to prove that U ′ is τ -compact. Invoking the universality of colimits
once more, we observe that U ′ is a τ -small colimit of objects of the form U ′′ = U ′ ×X ′ p(J), where J is an
object of J′. We now observe that U ′′ is a subobject of p(J) ∈ Xκ, and is therefore τ -compact by assumption
(2). It follows that U ′, being a τ -small colimit of τ -compact objects of X, is also τ -compact.

Proposition 6.4.3.6. Let 0 < n < ∞, and let X be an ∞-category satisfying the following conditions:

(i) The ∞-category X is presentable.

(ii) Colimits in X are universal.

(iii) Coproducts in X are disjoint.

(iv) The eﬀective groupoid objects of X are precisely the n-eﬃcient groupoids.

Then there exists a small n-category C which admits ﬁnite limits, a Grothendieck topology on C, and an
equivalence X → Shv≤n−1(C).

Proof. Without loss of generality we may suppose that X is minimal. Choose a regular cardinal κ such that
X is κ-accessible, and the full subcategory C ⊆ X spanned by the κ-compact objects of X is stable under
the formation of subobjects and ﬁnite limits (Lemma 6.4.3.5). We endow C with the canonical topology
induced by the inclusion C ⊆ X. According to Theorem 5.1.5.6, there is an (essentially unique) colimit
preserving functor F : P(C) → X such that F ◦ j is equivalent to the inclusion C ⊆ X, where j : C → P(C)
denotes the Yoneda embedding. The proof of Theorem 5.5.1.1 shows that F has a fully faithful right adjoint
G : X → P(C). We will complete the proof by showing that the essential image of G is precisely Shv≤n−1(C).
Since X is equivalent to an n-category (Proposition 6.4.3.4) and G is left exact, we conclude that G
factors through P≤n−1(C).
It follows from Proposition 6.2.4.6 that G factors through Shv≤n−1(C). Let
X′ ⊆ Shv≤n−1(C) denote the essential image of G. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that
X′ = Shv≤n−1(C). Let ∅ be an initial object of X. The space MapX(X, ∅) is contractible if X is an initial
object of X, and empty otherwise (Lemma 6.1.3.6). It follows from Proposition 6.2.2.10 that G(∅) is an
initial object of Shv≤n−1(C).

We next claim that X′ is stable under small coproducts in Shv≤n−1(C). It will suﬃce to show that the
map G preserves coproducts. Let {Uα} be a small collection of objects of X and U their coproduct in X.
According to Lemma 6.1.5.1, we have a pullback diagram

φ

Vα,β

Uα

φ′

Uβ

/ U,

where Vα,β is an initial object of X if α 6= β, while φ and φ′ are equivalences if α = β. The functor G
preserves all limits, so that the diagram

G(Vα,β)

G(Uα)

G(Uβ)

/ G(U )

is a pullback in Shv≤n−1(C). Let U ′ denote a coproduct of the objects i(Uα) in Shv≤n−1(C), and let
g : U ′ → G(U ) be the induced map. Since colimits in X are universal, we obtain a natural identiﬁcation of
U ′ ×G(U) U ′ with the coproduct

(G(Uα) ×G(U) G(Uβ)) ≃

Uα ≃ U ′,

where the second equivalence follows from our observation that G preserves initial objects. Applying Lemma
5.5.6.15, we deduce that g is a monomorphism.

To prove that g is an equivalence, it will suﬃce to show that the map

π0U ′(C) → π0G(U )(C) = π0 MapX(C, U )

α ∈ π0U ′(Cα) denote the homotopy class of the composition G(Cα)

is surjective for every object C ∈ C. Since colimits in X are universal, every map h : C → U can be written
as a coproduct of maps hα : Cα → Uα. Each Cα is a subobject of C (Lemma 6.4.4.8) and therefore belongs
hα→ G(Uα) → U ′. Since
to C. Let h′
α π0U ′(Cα) contains an element h′
the topology on C is canonical, Lemma 6.2.4.4 implies that π0U ′(C) ≃
α. It is now clear that h is the image of h′ under the map π0U ′(C) → π0 MapX(C, U ).
which restricts to each h′
We will prove the following result by induction on k: if there exists a k-truncated morphism f : X → Y ,
where Y ∈ X′ and X ∈ Shv≤n−1(C), then X ∈ X′. Taking k = n− 1 and Y to be a ﬁnal object of Shv≤n−1(C)
(which belongs to X′ because C contains a ﬁnal object), we conclude that every object of Shv≤n−1(C) belongs
to X′, which completes the proof.

If k = −2, then f is an equivalence so that X ∈ X′ as desired. Assume now that k ≥ −1. Since X′
contains the essential image of the Yoneda embedding and is stable under coproducts, there exists an eﬀective
epimorphism p : U → X in Shv≤n−1(C), where U ∈ X′. Let U • be a ˇCech nerve of p in Shv≤n−1(C), and U•
the associated groupoid object. We claim that U• is a groupoid object of X′. Since X′ is stable under limits
in Shv≤n−1(C), it suﬃces to prove that U0 = U and U1 = U ×X U belong to X′. We now observe that there
exists a pullback diagram

Since f is k-truncated, δ is (k − 1)-truncated (Lemma 5.5.6.15), so that δ′ is (k − 1)-truncated. Since
U ×Y U belongs to X′ (because X′ is stable under limits), our inductive hypothesis allows us to conclude
that U ×X U ∈ X′, as desired.

We observe that U• is an n-eﬃcient groupoid object of X′. Invoking assumption (iv), we conclude that
U• is eﬀective in X′. Let X ′ ∈ X′ be a colimit of U• in X′, so that we have a morphism u : X → X ′ in
Shv≤n−1(C)U•/. To complete the proof that X ∈ X′, it will suﬃce to show that u is an equivalence. Since u
induces an equivalence

U ×X U → U ×X ′ U,

it is a monomorphism (Lemma 5.5.6.15). It will therefore suﬃce to show that u is an eﬀective epimorphism.

where p is an eﬀective epimorphism; it therefore suﬃces to show that p′ is an eﬀective epimorphism which
follows immediately from Proposition 6.2.4.6.

Remark 6.4.3.7. Proposition 6.4.3.6 is valid also for n = 0, but is almost vacuous: coproducts in a 0-topos
X are never disjoint unless X is trivial (equivalent to the ﬁnal ∞-category ∗).

Remark 6.4.3.8. In a certain respect, the theory of ∞-topoi is simpler than the theory of ordinary topoi:
in an ∞-topos, every groupoid object is eﬀective; it is not necessary to impose any additional conditions like
n-eﬃciency. The absense of this condition gives the theory of ∞-topoi a slightly diﬀerent ﬂavor than ordinary
topos theory. In an ∞-topos, we are free to form quotients of objects not only by equivalence relations, but
by arbitrary groupoid actions. In geometry, this extra ﬂexibility allows the construction of useful objects
such as orbifolds and algebraic stacks, which are useful in a variety of mathematical situations.

One can imagine weakening the gluing conditions even further, and considering axioms having the form
“every category object is eﬀective”. This seems like a natural approach to a theory of topos-like (∞, ∞)-
categories. However, we will not pursue the matter any further here.

It follows from Proposition 6.4.3.6 (and arguments to be given in §6.4.4) that every left-exact localization
of a presheaf n-category P≤n−1(C) can also be obtained as an n-category of sheaves. According to the next
two results, this is no accident: every left exact localization of P≤n−1(C) is topological, and the topological
localizations of P≤n−1(C) correspond precisely to the Grothendieck topologies on C (provided that C is an
n-category).

Proposition 6.4.3.9. Let X be a presentable n-category, 0 ≤ n < ∞, and suppose that colimits in X are
universal. Let L : X → Y be a left exact localization. Then L is a topological localization.

Proof. Let S denote the collection of all monomorphisms f : U → V in X such that Lf is an equivalence.
Since L is left exact, it is clear that S is stable under pullback. Let S be the strongly saturated class
of morphisms generated by S. Proposition 6.2.1.2 implies that S is stable under pullback, and therefore
topological. Proposition 6.2.1.6 implies that S is generated by a (small) set of morphisms. Let X′ ⊆ X
denote the full subcategory spanned by S-local objects. According to Proposition 5.5.4.15, X′ is an accessible
localization of X; let L′ denote the associated localization functor. Since Lf is an equivalence for each f ∈ S,
the localization L is equivalent to the composition

X L′

→ X′ L| X′

→ Y .

We may therefore replace X by X′ and thereby reduce to the case where S consists precisely of the equivalences
in X; we wish to prove that L is an equivalence.

monomorphism, and so belongs to S, and is therefore an equivalence. Suppose that k ≥ 0. Let δ : X →
X ×Y X be the diagonal map (which is well-deﬁned up to equivalence). According to Lemma 5.5.6.15, δ is
(k − 1)-truncated. Since L is left exact, L(δ) can be identiﬁed with a diagonal map LX → LX ×LY LX,
which is therefore an equivalence. The inductive hypothesis implies that δ is an equivalence. Applying
Lemma 5.5.6.15 again, we deduce that f is a monomorphism, so that f ∈ S and is therefore an equivalence
as noted above.

Since X is an n-category, every morphism in X is (n− 1)-truncated. We conclude that for every morphism
f in X, f is an equivalence if and only if Lf is an equivalence. Since L is a localization functor, it must be
an equivalence.

6.4.4 n-Topoi and Descent
Let X be an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits, and let OX denote the functor ∞-category Fun(∆1, X)
equipped with the Cartesian ﬁbration e : OX → X (given by evaluation at {1} ⊆ ∆1), as in §6.1.1. Let
F : Xop →
Cat∞ be a functor which classiﬁes e; informally, F associates to each object U ∈ X the ∞-
category X/U . According to Theorem 6.1.3.9, X is an ∞-topos if and only if F the functor F preserves
d
limits, and factors through PrL ⊆
Cat∞. The assumption that F preserves limits can be viewed as a descent
it asserts that if X → U is a morphism of X, and U is decomposed into “pieces” Uα, then X
condition:
can be canonically reconstructed from the “pieces” X ×U Uα. The goal of this section is to obtain a similar
characterization of the class of n-topoi, for 0 ≤ n < ∞.

d

We begin by considering the case where X is the (nerve of) the category of sets. In this case, we can
think of F as a contravariant functor from sets to categories, which carries a set U to the category Set/U .
This functor does not preserve pullbacks: given a pushout square

Notation 6.4.4.2. Let X be an ∞-category which admits pullbacks, and let 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. We let On
X denote
the full subcategory of OX spanned by morphisms f : U → X which are (n − 2)-truncated, and O(n)
X ⊆ On
X
the subcategory whose objects are (n − 2)-truncated morphisms in X, and whose morphisms are Cartesian
transformations (see Notation 6.1.3.4).

Example 6.4.4.3. Let X be an ∞-category which admits pullbacks. Then O0
X is the full subcategory of OX
spanned by the ﬁnal objects in each ﬁber of the morphism p : OX → X. Since p is a coCartesian ﬁbration
(Corollary 2.4.7.12), Proposition 2.4.4.9 asserts that the restriction p| O0
X is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial
sets.

Lemma 6.4.4.4. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal and coproducts are
disjoint, and let n ≥ −2. Then the class of n-truncated morphisms in X is stable under small coproducts.

Proof. The proof is by induction on n, where the case n = −2 is obvious. Suppose that the {fα : Xα → Yα}
is a family of n-truncated morphisms in X having coproduct f : X → Y . Since colimits in X are universal,
we conclude that X ×Y X can be written as a coproduct

aα,β
Applying Lemma 6.1.5.1, we can rewrite this coproduct as

aα,β

(Xα ×Y Xβ) ≃

(Xα ×Yα (Yα ×Y Yβ) ×Yβ Xβ).

(Xα ×Yα Xα).

Consequently, the diagonal map δ : X → X ×Y X is a coproduct of diagonal maps {δα : Xα → Xα ×Yα Xα}.
Applying Lemma 5.5.6.15, we deduce that each δα is (n − 1)-truncated, so that δ is (n − 1)-truncated by the
inductive hypothesis. We now apply Lemma 5.5.6.15 again to deduce that f is n-truncated, as desired.

Combining Lemmas 6.1.3.3, 6.1.3.5, 6.1.3.7, and 6.4.4.4, we deduce the following analogue of Theorem

6.1.3.9.

Theorem 6.4.4.5. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal and coproducts are

Proposition 6.4.4.6. Let X be an n-topos, 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. Then colimits in X are universal.

Proof. Using Lemma 6.1.3.15, we may reduce to the case X = P≤n−1(C) for some small ∞-category C. Using
Proposition 5.1.2.2, we may further reduce to the case where X = τ≤n−1 S.

Let f : X → Y be a map of (n− 1)-truncated spaces, and let f ∗ : S/Y → S/X be a pullback functor. Since
X is stable under limits in S, f ∗ restricts to give a functor X/Y → X/X ; we wish to prove that this restricted
functor commutes with colimits. We observe that X/X and X/Y can be identiﬁed with the full subcategories
of S/X and S/Y spanned by the (n − 1)-truncated objects, by Lemma 5.5.6.14. Let τX : S/X → X/X and
τY : S/Y → X/Y denote left adjoints to the inclusions. The functor f ∗ preserves all colimits (Lemma 6.1.3.14)
and all limits (since f ∗ has a left adjoint). Consequently, Proposition 5.5.6.28 implies that τX ◦ f ∗ ≃ f ∗ ◦ τY .
Let p : K ⊲ → X/Y be a colimit diagram. We wish to show that f ∗ ◦ p is a colimit diagram. According
to Remark 5.2.7.5, we may assume that p = τY ◦ p′, for some colimit diagram p′ : K ⊲ → S/Y . Since colimits
in S are universal (Lemma 6.1.3.14), the composition f ∗ ◦ p′ : K ⊲ → S/X is a colimit diagram. Since τX
preserves colimits, we conclude that τX ◦ f ∗ ◦ p′ : K ⊲ → X/X is a colimit diagram, so that f ∗ ◦ τY ◦ p′ = f ∗ ◦ p
is also a colimit diagram, as desired.

Proposition 6.4.4.7. Let Y be an ∞-topos and let X = τ≤n Y, 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. Then the class of (n − 2)-
truncated morphisms in X is local.

Proof. Combining Propositions 6.2.3.17, 6.2.3.14, and Lemma 6.4.4.4, we conclude that the class of (n − 2)-
truncated morphisms in Y is local. Consequently, the Cartesian ﬁbration On
Y → Y is classiﬁed by a colimit
preserving functor F : Y →
X → X is classiﬁed by F | X. To prove that F | X is
colimit-preserving, it will suﬃce to show that F is equivalent to F ◦ τ≤n; in other words, that F carries

We conclude this section by proving the following generalization of Proposition 6.1.3.19, which also
establishes the implication (4) ⇒ (6) of Theorem 6.4.1.5. We will assume n > 0; the case n = 0 was analyzed
in §6.4.2.

Lemma 6.4.4.8. Let X be a presentable ∞-category in which colimits are universal, and let f : ∅ → X be
a morphism in X, where ∅ is an initial object of X. Then f is a monomorphism.

Proof. Let Y be an arbitrary object of X, we wish to show that composition with f induces a (−1)-truncated
map

MapX(Y, ∅) → MapX(Y, X).

If Y is an initial object of X, then both sides are contractible; otherwise the left side is empty (Lemma
6.1.3.6).

Proposition 6.4.4.9. Let 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞, and let X be a presentable n-category. Suppose that colimits in X are
universal, and that the class of (n − 2)-truncated morphisms in X is local. Then X satisﬁes the n-categorical
Giraud axioms:

(i) The ∞-category X is equivalent to a presentable n-category.

(ii) Colimits in X are universal.

(iii) Coproducts in X are disjoint.

(iv) Every n-eﬃcient groupoid object of X is eﬀective.

516

Proof. Axioms (i) and (ii) hold by assumption. To show that coproducts in X are disjoint, let us consider
an arbitrary pair of objects X, Y ∈ X, and let ∅ denote an initial object of X. Let f : ∅ → X be a morphism
(unique up to homotopy, since ∅ is initial). Since colimits in X are universal, f is a monomorphism (Lemma
6.4.4.8) and therefore belongs to On
X, since n ≥ 1. We observe that id∅ is an initial object of OX, so we can
form a pushout diagram

6.4.5 Localic ∞-Topoi

The standard example of an ordinary topos is the category Shv(X; Set) of sheaves (of sets) on a topological
space X. Of course, not every topos is of this form: the category Shv(X; Set) is generated under colimits by
subobjects of its ﬁnal object (which can be identiﬁed with open subsets of X). A topos X with this property
is said to be localic, and is determined up to equivalence by the locale Sub(1X), which we may view as a
0-topos. The objective of this section is to obtain an ∞-categorical analogue of this picture, which will allow
us to relate the theory of n-topoi to that of m-topoi, for all 0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ ∞.

Deﬁnition 6.4.5.1. Let X and Y be n-topoi, 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ A geometric morphism from X to Y is a functor
f∗ : X → Y which admits a left exact left adjoint (which we will typically denote by f ∗).

We let Fun∗(X, Y) denote the full subcategory of the ∞-category Fun(X, Y) spanned by the geometric
Cat∞ whose objects are n-topoi and whose morphisms are

n denote the subcategory of

morphisms, and TopR
geometric morphisms.

Remark 6.4.5.2. In the case where n = 1, the ∞-category of geometric morphisms Fun∗(X, Y) between
two 1-topoi is equivalent to (the nerve of) the category of geometric morphisms between the ordinary topoi
hX and hY.

d

Remark 6.4.5.3. In the case where n = 0, the ∞-category of geometric morphisms Fun∗(X, Y) between
two 0-topoi is equivalent to the nerve of the partially ordered set of homomorphisms from the underlying
locale of Y to the underlying locale of X. (A homomorphism between locales is a map of partially ordered
sets which preserve ﬁnite meets and arbitrary joins.) In the case where X and Y are associated to (sober)
topological spaces X and Y , this is simply the set of continuous maps from X to Y , partially ordered by
specialization.

If m ≤ n, then the ∞-categories TopR

m and TopR

n are related by the following observation:

Proposition 6.4.5.4. Let X be an n-topos, and let 0 ≤ m ≤ n. Then the full subcategory τ≤m−1 X spanned
by the (m − 1)-truncated objects is an m-topos.

Proof. If m = n = ∞, the result is obvious. Otherwise, it follows immediately from (2) of Theorem
6.4.1.5.

Lemma 6.4.5.5. Let C be a small n-category which admits ﬁnite limits, and let Y be an ∞-topos. Then the
restriction map

Fun∗(Y, P(C)) → Fun∗(τ≤n−1 Y, P≤n−1(C))

is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Proof. Let M ⊆ Fun(P(C), Y) and M′ ⊆ Fun(P≤n−1(C), τ≤n−1 Y) denote the full subcategories spanned
by left exact, colimit preserving functors. In view of Proposition 5.2.6.2, it will suﬃce to prove that the
restriction map θ : M → M′ is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Let M′′ denote full subcategory of Fun(P(C), τ≤n−1 Y) spanned by colimit preserving functors whose
restriction to P≤n−1(C) is left exact. Corollary 5.5.6.22 implies that the restriction map θ′ : M′′ → M′ is an
equivalence of ∞-categories.

Let j : C → P≤n−1(C) ⊆ P(C) denote the Yoneda embedding. Composition with j yields a commutative

diagram

Fun(C, τ≤n−1 Y).

Theorem 5.1.5.6 implies that ψ and ψ′ ◦ θ′ are fully faithful. Since θ′ is an equivalence of ∞-categories, we
deduce that ψ′ is fully faithful. Thus θ is fully faithful; to complete the proof, we must show that ψ and ψ′

loss of generality, we may suppose that f is a composition

C j

→ P≤n−1(C)

g∗
→ τ≤n−1 Y .

As a composition of left exact functors, f is left exact. We may now invoke Proposition 6.1.5.2 to deduce
that f belongs to the essential image of ψ.

Lemma 6.4.5.6. Let C be a small n-category which admits ﬁnite limits and is equipped with a Grothendieck
topology, and let Y be an ∞-topos. Then the restriction map

θ : Fun∗(Y, Shv(C)) → Fun∗(τ≤n−1 Y, Shv≤n−1(C))

is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Proof. We have a commutative diagram

Fun∗(Y, Shv(C))

Fun∗(Y, P(C))

θ

θ′

Fun∗(τ≤n−1 Y, Shv≤n−1(C))

/ Fun∗(τ≤n−1 Y, P≤n−1(C))

where the vertical arrows are inclusions of full subcategories, and θ′ is an equivalence of ∞-categories (Lemma
6.4.5.5). To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that if f∗ : Y → P(C) is a geometric morphism such
that f∗|τ≤n−1 Y factors through Shv≤n−1(C), then f∗ factors through Shv(C).

Let f ∗ be a left adjoint to f∗, and let S denote the collection of all morphisms in P(C) which localize to
equivalences in Shv(C). We must show that f ∗S consists of equivalences in Y. Let S ⊆ S be the collection of
monomorphisms which belong to S. Since Shv(C) is a topological localization of P(C), it will suﬃce to show
that f ∗S consists of equivalences in Y. Let g : X → Y belong to S. Since P(C) is generated under colimits
by the essential image of the Yoneda embedding, we can write Y as a colimit of a diagram K → P≤n−1(C).
Since colimits in P(C) are universal, we obtain a corresponding expression of g as a colimit of morphisms
{gα : Xα → Yα} which are pullbacks of g, where Yα ∈ P≤n−1(C). In this case, gα is again a monomorphism,
so that Xα is also (n − 1)-truncated. Since f ∗ commutes with colimits, it will suﬃce to show that each
f ∗(gα) is an equivalence. But this follows immediately from our assumption that f∗|τ≤n−1 Y factors through
Shv≤n−1(Y).

Proposition 6.4.5.7. Let 0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ ∞, and let Y be an m-topos. There exists an n-topos X and a cat-
egorical equivalence f∗ : τ≤m−1 X → Y with the following universal property: for any n-topos Z, composition
with f∗ induces an equivalence of ∞-categories

θ : Fun∗(Z, X) → Fun∗(τ≤m−1 Z, Y).

Proof. If m = ∞, then also n = ∞ and we may take X = Y. Otherwise, we may apply Theorem 6.4.1.5 to
reduce to the case where Y = Shv≤m−1(C), where C is a small m-category which admits ﬁnite limits and is
equipped with a Grothendieck topology. In this case, we let X = Shv≤n−1(C) and deﬁne f∗ to be the identity.
Let Z be an arbitrary n-topos. According to Theorem 6.4.1.5, we may assume without loss of generality that
Z = τ≤n−1 Z′, where Z′ is an ∞-topos. We have a commutative diagram

Deﬁnition 6.4.5.8. Let 0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ ∞, and let X be an n-topos. We will say that X is m-localic if, for
any n-topos Y, the natural map

is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Fun∗(Y, X) → Fun∗(τ≤m−1 Y, τ≤m−1 X)

According to Proposition 6.4.5.7, every m-topos X is equivalent to the subcategory of (m − 1)-truncated
objects in an m-localic n-topos X′, and X′ is determined up to equivalence. More precisely, the truncation
functor

TopR
n
m, where C ⊆ TopR

τ≤m−1→ TopR

m

induces an equivalence C → TopR
n is the full subcategory spanned by the m-localic n-topoi.
In other words, we may view the ∞-category of m-topoi as a localization of the ∞-category of n-topoi. In
particular, the theory of m-topoi for m < ∞ can be regarded as a special case of the theory of ∞-topoi. For
this reason, we will focus our attention on the case n = ∞ for most of the remainder of this book.

Proposition 6.4.5.9. Let X be an n-localic ∞-topos. Then any topological localization of X is also n-localic.

Proof. The proof of Proposition 6.4.5.7 shows that X is n-localic if and only if there exists a small n-category
C which admits ﬁnite limits, a Grothendieck topology on C, and an equivalence X → Shv(C). In other words,
X is n-localic if and only if it is equivalent to a topological localization of P(C), where C is a small n-category
which admits ﬁnite limits. It is clear that any topological localization of X has the same property.

Let X be an ∞-topos. One should think of the ∞-categories τ≤n−1 X as “Postnikov sections” of X. The
classical 1-truncation τ≤1X of a homotopy type X remembers only the fundamental groupoid of X.
It
therefore knows all about local systems of sets on X, but nothing about ﬁbrations over X with non-discrete
ﬁbers. The relationship between X and τ≤0 X is analogous: τ≤0 X knows about the sheaves of sets on X, but
has forgotten about sheaves with nondiscrete stalks.

Remark 6.4.5.10. In view of the above discussion, the notation τ≤0 X is unfortunate because the analogous
notation for the 1-truncation of a homotopy type X is τ≤1X. We caution the reader not to regard τ≤0 X as
the result of applying an operation τ≤0 to X; it instead denotes the essential image of the truncation functor
τ≤0 : X → X.

6.5 Homotopy Theory in an ∞-Topos

In classical homotopy theory, the most important invariants of a (pointed) space X are its homotopy groups
πi(X, x). Our ﬁrst objective in this section is to deﬁne analogous invariants in the case where X is an object
of an arbitrary ∞-topos X. In this setting, the homotopy groups are not ordinary groups but are instead
sheaves of groups on the underlying topos Disc(X). In §6.5.1, we will study these homotopy groups and the
closely related theory of n-connectivity. The main theme is that the internal homotopy theory of a general
∞-topos X behaves much like the classical case X = S.

One important classical fact which does not hold in general for an ∞-topos is Whitehead’s theorem. If
f : X → Y is a map of CW-complexes, then f is a homotopy equivalence if and only if f induces bijective
If f : X → Y is a map in an
maps πi(X, x) → πi(Y, f (x)) for any i ≥ 0 and any base point x ∈ X.
arbitrary ∞-topos X satisfying an analogous condition on (sheaves of) homotopy groups, then we say that f
is ∞-connective. We will say that an ∞-topos X is hypercomplete if every ∞-connective morphism in X is an
equivalence. Whitehead’s theorem may be interpreted as saying that the ∞-topos S is hypercomplete. An
arbitrary ∞-topos X need not be hypercomplete. We will survey the situation in §6.5.2, where we also give
some reformulations of the notion of hypercompleteness and show that every topos X has a hypercompletion
X∧. In §6.5.3, we will show that an ∞-topos X is hypercomplete if and only if X satisﬁes a descent condition
with respect to hypercoverings (other versions of this result can be found in [20] and [78]).

Remark 6.5.0.1. The Brown-Joyal-Jardine theory of simplicial (pre)sheaves on a topological space X is a
model for the hypercomplete ∞-topos Shv(X)∧. In many respects, the ∞-topos Shv(X) of sheaves of spaces
on X is better behaved before hypercompletion. We will outline some of the advantages of Shv(X) in §6.5.4
and in §7.

6.5.1 Homotopy Groups

Let X be an ∞-topos, and let X be an object of X. We will refer to a discrete object of X/X as a sheaf of
sets on X. Since X is presentable, it is automatically cotensored over spaces, as explained in Remark 5.5.2.6.
Consequently, for any object X of X and any simplicial set K, there exists an object X K of X equipped with
natural isomorphisms

MapX(Y, X K) → MapH(K, MapX(Y, X))

in the homotopy category H of spaces.

Deﬁnition 6.5.1.1. Let Sn = ∂ ∆n+1 ∈ H denote the (simplicial) n-sphere, and ﬁx a base point ∗ ∈ Sn.
Then evaluation at ∗ induces a morphism s : X Sn
→ X in X. We may regard s as an object of X/X , and we
deﬁne πn(X) = τ≤0s ∈ X/X to be the associated discrete object of X/X .

We will generally identify πn(X) with its image in the underlying topos Disc(X/X ) (where it is well-deﬁned
, which determines a

up to canonical isomorphism). The constant map Sn → ∗ induces a map X → X Sn
base point of πn(X).

Suppose that K and K ′ are pointed simplicial sets, and let K ∨ K ′ denote the coproduct K

∗ K ′. There

Lemma 6.5.1.2. Let X be an ∞-topos. The truncation functor τ≤n : X → X preserves ﬁnite products.

Proof. We must show that for any ﬁnite collection of objects {Xα}α∈A having product X, the induced map

equivalence, it suﬃces to show that it remains an equivalence after evaluation at any object C ∈ C; thus we
may reduce to the case where X = S considered above. In the general case, X is equivalent to the essential
image of a left-exact localization functor L : P(C) → P(C) for some small ∞-category C. Without loss of
generality, we may identify X with a full subcategory of P(C). Then X ⊆ X′ = P(C) is stable under limits,
so that X may be identiﬁed with a product of the family {Xα}α∈A in X′. It follows from the case treated
above that the natural map

τ X′
≤nX →

τ X′
≤nXα

is an equivalence. But Proposition 5.5.6.28 implies that L ◦ τ X′
≤n| X is an n-truncation functor for X. The
desired result now follows by applying the functor L to both sides of the above equivalence, and invoking
the assumption that L is left-exact (here we must require the ﬁniteness of A).

Yα∈A

It follows from Lemma 6.5.1.2 that there is a canonical isomorphism

) ≃ τ

in the topos Disc(X/X ). In particular, for n > 0, the usual comultiplication Sn → Sn ∨ Sn (a well-deﬁned
map in the homotopy category H) induces a multiplication map πn(X) × πn(X) → πn(X). As in ordinary
homotopy theory, we conclude that πn(X) is a group object of Disc(X/X ) for n > 0, which is commutative
for n > 1.

In order to work eﬀectively with homotopy sets, it is convenient to deﬁne the homotopy sets πn(f ) of a
morphism f : X → Y to be the homotopy sets of f considered as an object of the ∞-topos X/Y . In view of
the equivalences X/f → X/X , we may identify πn(f ) with an object of Disc(X/X ), which is again a sheaf of
groups if n ≥ 1, and abelian groups if n ≥ 2. The intuition is that the stalk of these sheaves at a point p of
X is the nth homotopy group of the homotopy ﬁber of f , taken with respect to the base point p.

Remark 6.5.1.3. It is useful to have the following recursive deﬁnition for homotopy groups. Let f : X → Y
be a morphism in an ∞-topos X. Regarding f as an object of the topos X/Y , we may take its 0th truncation
X/Y
X/Y
≤0 f . This is a discrete object of X/Y , and by deﬁnition we have π0(f ) ≃ f ∗τ
≤0 (f ).
τ
X/Y
The natural map X → τ
≤0 (f ) gives a global section of π0(f ). Note that in this case, π0(f ) is the pullback
of a discrete object of X/Y : this is because the deﬁnition of π0 does not require a base point.

X/Y
≤0 (X) ≃ X ×Y τ

If n > 0, then we have a natural isomorphism πn(f ) ≃ πn−1(δ) in Disc(X/X ), where δ : X → X ×Y X is

the associated diagonal map.

Remark 6.5.1.4. Let f : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi, and let g : Y → Y ′ be a morphism in
Y. Then there is a canonical isomorphism f ∗(πn(g)) ≃ πn(f ∗(g)) in Disc(X/f ∗Y ). This follows immediately
from Proposition 5.5.6.28.

Remark 6.5.1.5. Given a pair of composable morphisms X
pointed objects

f
→ Y

g
→ Z, there is an associated sequence of

. . . → f ∗πn+1(g)

δn+1→ πn(f ) → πn(g ◦ f ) → f ∗πn(g)

in the ordinary topos Disc(X/X ), with the usual exactness properties. To construct the boundary map δn,
Sn−1 D+ of two hemispheres
we observe that the n-sphere Sn can be written as a (homotopy) pushout D−
along the equator. By construction, f ∗πn(g) can be identiﬁed with the 0-truncation of

which maps by restriction to

×Y Sn−1 Y.

We now observe that the 0-truncation of the latter object is naturally isomorphic to πn−1(f ) ∈ Disc(X/X ).
To prove the exactness of the above sequence in an ∞-topos X, we ﬁrst choose an accessible left exact
g
localization L : P(C) → X. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that the diagram X
→ Z is
the image under L of a diagram in P(C). Using Remark 6.5.1.4, we conclude that the sequence constructed
above is equivalent to the image under L of an analogous sequence in the ∞-topos P(C). Since L is left
exact, it will suﬃce to prove that this second sequence is exact; in other words, we may reduce to the case
X = P(C). Working componentwise, we can reduce further to the case where X = S. The desired result now
follows from classical homotopy theory. (Special care should be taken regarding the exactness of the above
sequence at π0(f ): really this should be interpreted in terms of an action of the group f ∗π1(g) on π0(f ). We
leave the details of the construction of this action to the reader. )

f
→ Y

Remark 6.5.1.6. If X = S, and η : ∗ → X is a pointed space, then η∗πn(X) can be identiﬁed with the nth
homotopy group of X with base point η.

We now study the implications of the vanishing of homotopy groups.

Proposition 6.5.1.7. Let f : X → Y be an n-truncated morphism in an ∞-topos X. Then πk(f ) ≃ ∗ for
all k > n. If n ≥ 0 and πn(f ) ≃ ∗, then f is (n − 1)-truncated.

If n = −2, then f is an equivalence and there is nothing to
Proof. The proof goes by induction on n.
prove. Otherwise, the diagonal map δ : X → X ×Y X is (n − 1)-truncated (Lemma 5.5.6.15). The inductive
hypothesis and Remark 6.5.1.3 allow us to deduce that πk(f ) ≃ πk−1(δ) ≃ ∗ whenever k > n and k > 0.
Similarly, if n ≥ 1 and πn(f ) ≃ πn−1(δ) ≃ ∗, then δ is (n − 2)-truncated by the inductive hypothesis, so that
f is (n − 1)-truncated (Lemma 5.5.6.15).

The case of small k and n requires special attention: we must show that if f is 0-truncated, then f is
X/Y
(−1)-truncated if and only if π0(f ) ≃ ∗. Because f is 0-truncated, we have an equivalence τ
≤0 (f ) ≃ f ,
so that π0(f ) ≃ X ×Y X. To say π0(f ) ≃ ∗ is to assert that the diagonal map δ : X → X ×Y X is an
equivalence, which is equivalent to the assertion that f is (−1)-truncated (Lemma 5.5.6.15).

Remark 6.5.1.8. The Proposition 6.5.1.7 implies that if f is n-truncated for some n ≫ 0, then we can test
whether or not f is m-truncated for any particular value of m by computing the homotopy groups of f . In
contrast to the classical situation, it is not possible to drop the assumption that f is n-truncated for n ≫ 0.

Lemma 6.5.1.9. Let X be an object in an ∞-topos X, and let p : X → Y be an n-truncation of X. Then
p induces isomorphisms πk(X) ≃ p∗πk(Y ) for all k ≤ n.

Proof. Let φ : X → Y be a geometric morphism such that φ∗ is fully faithful. By Proposition 5.5.6.28 and
Remark 6.5.1.4, it will suﬃce to prove the lemma in the case where X = Y. We may therefore assume that
Y is an ∞-category of presheaves. In this case, homotopy groups and truncations are computed pointwise.
Thus we may reduce to the case X = S, where the conclusion follows from classical homotopy theory.

Deﬁnition 6.5.1.10. Let f : X → Y be a morphism in an ∞-topos X, and let 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. We will say that
f is n-connective if it is an eﬀective epimorphism and πk(f ) = ∗ for 0 ≤ k < n. We shall say that the object
X is n-connective if f : X → 1X is n-connective, where 1X denotes the ﬁnal object of X. By convention, we
will say that every morphism f in X is (−1)-connective.

523

Deﬁnition 6.5.1.11. Let X be an object of an ∞-topos X. We will say that X is connected if it is
1-connective: that is, if the truncation τ≤0X is a ﬁnal object in X.

Proposition 6.5.1.12. Let X be an object in an ∞-topos X and let n ≥ −1. Then X is n-connective if and
only if τ≤n−1X is a ﬁnal object of X.

Proof. The case n = −1 is trivial. The proof in general goes by induction on n ≥ 0. If n = 0, then the
conclusion follows from Proposition 6.2.3.4. Suppose n > 0. Let p : X → τn−1X be an (n − 1)-truncation of
X. If τ≤n−1X is a ﬁnal object of X, then

πkX ≃ p∗πk(τn−1X) ≃ ∗

for k < n by Lemma 6.5.1.9. Since the map p : X → τ≤n−1X ≃ 1X is an eﬀective epimorphism (Proposition
7.2.1.14), it follows that X is n-connective.

Conversely, suppose that X is n-connective. Then p∗πn−1(τ≤n−1X) ≃ ∗. Since p is an eﬀective epi-
morphism, Lemma 6.2.3.16 implies that πn−1(τ≤n−1X) = ∗. Using Proposition 6.5.1.7, we conclude that
τ≤n−1X is (n − 2)-truncated, so that τ≤n−1X ≃ τ≤n−2X. Repeating this argument, we reduce to the case
where n = 0 which was handled above.

Corollary 6.5.1.13. The class of n-connective objects of an ∞-topos X is stable under ﬁnite products.

Proof. Combine Proposition 6.5.1.12 with Lemma 6.5.1.2.

Let X be an ∞-topos and X an object of X. Since MapX(X, Y ) ≃ MapX(τ≤nX, Y ) whenever Y is n-
truncated, we deduce that X is (n+1)-connective if and only if the natural map MapX(1X, Y ) → MapX(X, Y )
is an equivalence for all n-truncated Y . From this, we can immediately deduce the following relative version
of Proposition 6.5.1.12:

Corollary 6.5.1.14. Let f : X → X ′ be a morphism in an ∞-topos X. Then f is (n + 1)-connective if and
only if composition with f induces a homotopy equivalence

for every n-truncated object Y ∈ X/X ′.

MapX/X′ (idX ′, Y ) → MapX/X′ (f, Y )

Remark 6.5.1.15. Let L : X → Y be a left exact localization of ∞-topoi, and let f : Y → Y ′ be an
n-connective morphism in Y. Then f is equivalent (in Fun(∆1, Y)) to Lf0, where f0 is an n-connective
morphism in X. To see this, we choose a (fully faithful) right adjoint G to L, and a factorization

where f ′ is n-connective and f ′′ is (n − 1)-truncated. Then Lf ′′ ◦ Lf ′ is equivalent to f , and is therefore
n-connective. It follows that Lf ′′ is an equivalence, so that Lf ′ is equivalent to f .

We conclude by noting the following stability properties of the class of n-connective morphisms:

Proposition 6.5.1.16. Let X be an ∞-topos.

(1) Let f : X → Y be a morphism in X. If f is n-connective, then it is m-connective for all m ≤ n.

Conversely, if f is n-connective for all n < ∞, then f is ∞-connective.

(2) Any equivalence in X is ∞-connective.

(4) Let π∗ : X → Y be left adjoint to a geometric morphism from π∗ : Y → X, and let f : X → X ′ be an

n-connective morphism in X. Then π∗f is an n-connective morphism in Y.

Proof. The ﬁrst three assertions are obvious. Claim (4) follows from Propositions 6.5.1.12 and 5.5.6.28. To
prove (5), we ﬁrst observe that Corollary 6.2.3.12 implies that g is an eﬀective epimorphism if and only if h
is an eﬀective epimorphism. According to Remark 6.5.1.5, we have a long exact sequence

. . . → f ∗πi+1(g)→πi(f ) → πi(h) → f ∗πi(g) → πi−1(f ) → . . .

of pointed objects in the topos Disc(X/X ). It is then clear that if f and g are n-connective, then so is h.
Conversely, if f and h are n-connective, then f ∗πi(g) ≃ ∗ for i ≤ n. Since f is an eﬀective epimorphism,
Lemma 6.2.3.16 implies that πi(g) ≃ ∗ for i ≤ n, so that g is also n-connective.

The ﬁrst assertion of (6) follows from (4), since a pullback functor q∗ : X/Y → X/Y ′ is left adjoint to a
geometric morphism. For the converse, let us suppose that q is an eﬀective epimorphism and that f ′ is n-
connective. According to Lemma 6.2.3.15, the maps f and q′ are eﬀective epimorphisms. Applying Remark
6.5.1.4, we conclude that there are canonical isomorphisms q′∗πk(f ) ≃ πk(f ′) in the topos Disc(X/X ′ ), so
that q′∗πk(f ) ≃ ∗ for k < n. Applying Lemma 6.2.3.16, we conclude that πk(f ) ≃ ∗ for k < n, so that f is
n-connective as desired.

Proposition 6.5.1.16, it will suﬃce to show that f0 is n-connective. Using Propositions 6.5.1.12 and 5.5.6.28,
we see that f0 is n-connective if and only if its image under the evaluation map P(C) → S associated to any
object C ∈ C is n-connective. In other words, we can reduce to the case where X = S, and the result now
follows from classical homotopy theory.

We conclude by establishing a few results which will be needed in §7.2:

Proposition 6.5.1.18. Let f : X → Y be a morphism in an ∞-topos X, δ : X → X ×Y X the associated
diagonal morphism, and n ≥ 0. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The morphism f is n-connective.

(2) The diagonal map δ : X → X ×Y X is (n − 1)-connective, and f is an eﬀective epimorphism.

Proof. Immediate from Deﬁnition 6.5.1.10 and Remark 6.5.1.3.

Proposition 6.5.1.19. Let X be an ∞-topos containing an object X, and let σ : ∆2 → X be a 2-simplex
corresponding to a diagram

Then f is an n-connective morphism in X if and only if σ is an n-connective morphism in X/X .

Proof. We observe that X/g → X/Z is a trivial ﬁbration, so that an object of X/g is n-connective if and only
if its image in X/Z is n-connective.

Proposition 6.5.1.20. Let f : X → Y be a morphism in an ∞-topos X, let s : Y → X be a section of f (so
that f ◦ s is homotopic to idY ), and let n ≥ 0. Then f is n-connective if and only if s is (n − 1)-connective.

Proof. We have a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → X which we may depict as follows:

Corollary 6.2.3.12 implies that f is an eﬀective epimorphism; this completes the proof in the case n = 0.
Suppose that n > 0, and that s is (n − 1)-connective. In particular, s is an eﬀective epimorphism. The
long exact sequence of Remark 6.5.1.5 gives an isomorphism πi(s) ≃ s∗πi+1(f ), so that s∗πk(f ) vanishes for
1 ≤ k < n. Applying Lemma 6.2.3.16, we conclude that πk(f ) ≃ ∗ for 1 ≤ k < n. Moreover, since s is an
eﬀective epimorphism it induces an eﬀective epimorphism π0(idY ) → π0(f ) in the ordinary topos Disc(X/Y ),
so that π0(f ) ≃ ∗ as well. This proves that f is n-connective.

Conversely, if f is n-connective, then πi(s) ≃ ∗ for i < n − 1; the only nontrivial point is to verify that s
is an eﬀective epimorphism. According to Proposition 6.5.1.19, it will suﬃce to prove that σ is an eﬀective
epimorphism when viewed as a morphism in X/Y . Using Proposition 7.2.1.14, we may reduce to proving
X/Y
that σ′ = τ
≤0 (σ) is an equivalence in X/Y . This is clear, since the source and target of σ′ are both ﬁnal
objects of X/Y (in virtue of our assumption that f is 1-connective).

Proposition 6.5.2.1 (Jardine [41]). There exists a left proper, combinatorial, simplicial model structure on
the category A, which admits the following description:

(C) A map f : F• → G• of simplicial presheaves on C is a local coﬁbration if it is a injective coﬁbration:
that is, if and only if the induced map F•(C) → G•(C) is a coﬁbration of simplicial sets for each object
C ∈ C.

(W ) A map f : F• → G• of simplicial presheaves on C is a local equivalence if and only if, for any object

C ∈ C and any commutative diagram of topological spaces

one can produce a dotted arrow so that the upper triangle commutes and the lower triangle commutes
up to a homotopy which is ﬁxed on Sn−1.

We refer the reader to [41] for a proof (one can also deduce Proposition 6.5.2.1 from Proposition A.2.6.13).

We will refer to the model structure of Proposition 6.5.2.1 as the local model structure on A.

Remark 6.5.2.2. In the case where the topos X of sheaves of sets on C has enough points, there is a
simpler description of the class (W ) of local equivalences: a map F → G of simplicial presheaves is a local
equivalence if and only if it induces weak homotopy equivalences Fx → Gx of simplicial sets, after passing
to the stalk at any point x of X. We refer the reader to [41] for details.

Let A◦ denote the full subcategory of A consisting of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects (with respect to the
local model structure), and let X = N(A◦) be the associated ∞-category. We observe that the local model
structure on A is a localization of the injective model structure on A. Consequently, the ∞-category X is a
localization of the ∞-category associated to the injective model structure on A, which (in view of Proposition
5.1.1.1) is equivalent to P(N(C)). It is tempting to guess that X is equivalent to the left exact localization
Shv(N(C)) constructed in §6.2.2. This is not true in general; however, as we will explain below, we can
always recover X as an accessible left-exact localization of Shv(N(C)). In particular, X is itself an ∞-topos.
In general, the diﬀerence between X and Shv(N(C)) is measured by the failure of Whitehead’s theorem.
Essentially by construction, the equivalences in A are those maps which induce isomorphisms on homotopy
sheaves. In general, this assumption is not strong enough to guarantee that a morphism in Shv(N(C)) is
an equivalence. However, this is the only diﬀerence: the ∞-category X can be obtained from Shv(N(C))
by inverting the class of ∞-connective morphisms (Proposition 6.5.2.14). Before proving this, we study the
class of ∞-connective morphisms in an arbitrary ∞-topos.
Lemma 6.5.2.3. Let p : C → D be a Cartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, let C′ be a full subcategory of
C, and suppose that for every p-Cartesian morphism f : C → C′ in C, if C′ ∈ C′, then C ∈ C′. Let D
be an object of D, and let f : C → C′ be a morphism in the ﬁber CD = C ×D{D} which exhibits C′ as a
C0
D-localization of C (see Deﬁnition 5.2.7.6). Then f exhibits C′ as a C-localization of C.

Proof. According to Proposition 2.4.3.3, p induces a Cartesian ﬁbration CC/ → DD/, which restricts to give
a Cartesian ﬁbration p′ : C′
C/ which is an initial object of
(p′)−1{idD} (Remark 5.2.7.7), and that idD is an initial object of DD/. Lemma 2.4.4.7 implies that f is an
initial object of C′

C/, so that f exhibits C′ as C′-localization of C (Remark 5.2.7.7) as desired.

C/ → DD/. We observe that f is an object of C′

Lemma 6.5.2.4. Let p : C → D be a Cartesian ﬁbration of ∞-categories, let C′ be a full subcategory of C,
and suppose that for every p-Cartesian morphism f : C → C′ in C, if C′ ∈ C′, then C ∈ C′. Suppose that
for each object D ∈ D, the ﬁber C′
D = C′ ×D{D} is a reﬂective subcategory of CD = C ×D{D} (see Remark
5.2.7.9). Then C′ is a reﬂective subcategory of C.

Proof. Combine Lemma 6.5.2.3 with Proposition 5.2.7.8.

Lemma 6.5.2.5. Let X be a presentable ∞-category, let C be an accessible ∞-category, and let α : F → G
be a natural transformation between accessible functors F, G : C → X. Let C(n) be the full subcategory of
C spanned by those objects C such that α(C) : F (C) → G(C) is n-truncated. Then C(n) is an accessible
subcategory of C (see Deﬁnition 5.4.7.8).

Proof. We work by induction on n. If n = −2, then we have a (homotopy) pullback diagram

C(n)

E

/ Fun(∆1, X)

where E is the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, X) spanned by equivalences. The inclusion of E into Fun(∆1, X)
is equivalent to the diagonal map X → Fun(∆1, X), and therefore accessible. Proposition 5.4.6.6 implies that
C(n) is an accessible subcategory of C, as desired.

If n ≥ −1, we apply the the inductive hypothesis to the diagonal functor δ : F → F ×G F , using Lemma

5.5.6.15.

Lemma 6.5.2.6. Let X be a presentable ∞-category, and let −2 ≤ n < ∞. Let C be the full subcategory of
Fun(∆1, X) spanned by the n-truncated morphisms. Then C is a strongly reﬂective subcategory of Fun(∆1, X).

Proof. Applying Lemma 6.5.2.4 to the projection Fun(∆1, X) → Fun({1}, X), we conclude that C is a reﬂec-
tive subcategory of Fun(∆1, X). The accessibility of C follows from Lemma 6.5.2.5.

Lemma 6.5.2.7. Let X be an ∞-topos, let 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞, and let D(n) be the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, X)
spanned by the n-connective morphisms of X. Then D(n) is an accessible subcategory of X and is stable
under colimits in X.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that n < ∞. Let C(n) ⊆ Fun(∆1, X) be the full subcategory spanned by the n-
truncated morphisms in X. According to Lemma 6.5.2.6, the inclusion C(n) ⊆ Fun(∆1, X) has a left adjoint
L : Fun(∆1, X) → C(n). Moreover, the proof of Lemma 6.5.2.3 shows that f is n-connective if and only if
Lf is an equivalence. It is easy to see that the full subcategory E ⊆ C(n) spanned by the equivalences is
stable under colimits in C(n), so that D(n) is stable under colimits in Fun(∆1, X). The accessibility of D(n)
follows from the existence of the (homotopy) pullback diagram

D(n)

and Proposition 5.4.6.6.

If n = ∞, we observe that D(n) = ∪m<∞ D(m), which is manifestly stable under colimits, and is an

accessible subcategory of X∆1

by Proposition 5.4.7.10.

Proposition 6.5.2.8. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let S denote the collection of ∞-connective morphisms of
X. Then S is strongly saturated and of small generation (see Deﬁnition 5.5.4.5).

Proof. Lemma 6.5.2.7 implies that S is stable under colimits in Fun(∆1, X), and Corollary 6.5.1.17 shows
that S is stable under pushouts. To prove that S has the two-out-of-three property, we consider a diagram
σ : ∆2 → X, which we depict as

/ Z.

If f is ∞-connective, then Proposition 6.5.1.16 implies that g is ∞-connective if and only if h is ∞-connective.
Suppose that g and h are ∞-connective. The long exact sequence

. . . → f ∗πn+1(g) → πn(f ) → πn(h) → f ∗πn(g) → πn−1(f ) → . . .

of Remark 6.5.1.5 shows that πn(f ) ≃ ∗ for all n ≥ 0. It will therefore suﬃce to prove that f is an eﬀective
epimorphism. According to Proposition 6.5.1.19, it will suﬃce to show that σ is an eﬀective epimorphism in
X/Z
X/Z
X/Z. According to Proposition 7.2.1.14, it suﬃces to show that τ
≤0 (g) are both ﬁnal objects
≤0 (h) and τ
of X/Z , which follows from the 0-connectivity of g and h (Proposition 6.5.1.12).

To show that S is of small generation, it suﬃces (in view of Lemma 5.5.4.14) to show that the full

subcategory of Fun(∆1, X) spanned by S is accessible. This follows from Lemma 6.5.2.7.

Let X be an ∞-topos. We will say that an object X of X is hypercomplete if it is local with respect to the
class of ∞-connective morphisms. Let X∧ denote the full subcategory of X spanned by the hypercomplete
objects of X. Combining Propositions 6.5.2.8 and 5.5.4.15, we deduce that X∧ is an accessible localization
of X. Moreover, since Proposition 6.5.1.16 implies that the class of ∞-connective morphisms is stable under
pullback, we deduce from Proposition 6.2.1.1 that X∧ is a left exact localization of X. It follows that X∧ is
itself an ∞-topos. We will show in a moment that X∧ can be described by a universal property.

Lemma 6.5.2.9. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let n < ∞. Then τ≤n X ⊆ X∧.

Proof. Corollary 6.5.1.14 implies that an n-truncated object of X is local with respect to every n-connective
morphism of X, and therefore with respect to every ∞-connective morphism of X.

Lemma 6.5.2.10. Let X be an ∞-topos, let L : X → X∧ be a left adjoint to the inclusion, and let X ∈ X be
such that LX is an ∞-connective object of X∧. Then LX is a ﬁnal object of X∧.

Proof. For each n < ∞, we have equivalences

1X ≃ τ X∧

≤n LX ≃ Lτ X

≤nX ≃ τ X

≤nX

where the ﬁrst is because of our hypothesis that LX is ∞-connective, the second is given by Proposition
5.5.6.28, and the third by Lemma 6.5.2.9. It follows that X is an ∞-connective object of X, so that LX is a
ﬁnal object of X∧ by construction.

We will say that an ∞-topos X is hypercomplete if X∧ = X; in other words, X is hypercomplete if every

∞-connective morphism of X is an equivalence, so that Whitehead’s theorem holds in X.

Remark 6.5.2.11. In [78], the authors use the term t-completeness to refer to the property that we have
called hypercompleteness.

Lemma 6.5.2.12. Let X be an ∞-topos. Then the ∞-topos X∧ is hypercomplete.

Proof. Let f : X → Y be an ∞-connective morphism in X∧. Applying Lemma 6.5.2.10 to the ∞-topos
(X∧)/Y ≃ (X/Y )∧, we deduce that f is an equivalence.

We are now prepared to characterize X∧ by a universal property:

Proposition 6.5.2.13. Let X and Y be ∞-topoi. Suppose that Y is hypercomplete. Then composition with
the inclusion X∧ ⊆ X induces an isomorphism

Fun∗(Y, X∧) → Fun∗(Y, X).
Proof. Let f∗ : Y → X be a geometric morphism; we wish to prove that f∗ factors through X∧. Let f ∗
denote a left adjoint to f∗; it will suﬃce to show that f ∗ carries each ∞-connective morphism u of X to
an equivalence in Y. Proposition 6.5.1.16 implies that f ∗(u) is ∞-connective, and the hypothesis that Y is
hypercomplete guarantees that u is an equivalence.

The following result establishes the relationship between our theory of hypercompleteness and the Brown-

Joyal-Jardine theory of simplicial presheaves.

Proposition 6.5.2.14. Let C be a small category equipped with a Grothendieck topology, and let A denote
the category of simplicial presheaves on C, endowed with the local model structure ( see Proposition 6.5.2.1
). Let A◦ denote the full subcategory consisting of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects, and let A = N(A◦) be the
corresponding ∞-category. Then A is equivalent to Shv(C)∧; in particular, it is a hypercomplete ∞-topos.
Proof. Let P(C) denote the ∞-category P(N(C)) of presheaves on N(C), and let A′ denote the model category
of simplicial presheaves on C, endowed with the injective model structure of §A.3.3. According to Proposition
4.2.4.4, the simplicial nerve functor induces an equivalence

θ : N(A′◦) → P(C).
We may identify N(A◦) with the full subcategory of N(A′◦) spanned by the S-local objects, where S is the
class of local equivalences (Proposition A.3.7.3).

/C, and let i : χ(0)

C → χC be the inclusion. We regard χC and χ(0)

We ﬁrst claim that θ| N(A◦) factors through Shv(C). Consider an object C ∈ C and a sieve C(0)

/C ⊆ C/C .
Let χC : C → Set be the functor D 7→ HomC(D, C) represented by C, let χ(0)
C be the subfunctor of χC
determined by the sieve C(0)
C as objects
of simplicial presheaves on C, which take values in the full subcategory of Set∆ spanned by the constant
simplicial sets. We observe that every simplicial presheaf on C which is valued in constant simplicial sets is
automatically ﬁbrant, and every object of A′ is coﬁbrant. Consequently, we may regard i as a morphism
in the ∞-category N(A′)◦. It is easy to see that θ(i) represents the monomorphism U → j(C) classiﬁed
by the sieve C(0)
/C is a covering sieve on C, then i is a local equivalence. Consequently, every object
X ∈ N(A◦) is i-local, so that θ(X) is θ(i)-local. By construction, Shv(C) is the full subcategory of P(C)
spanned by those objects which are θ(i)-local for every covering sieve C(0)
/C on every object C ∈ C. We
conclude that θ| N(A◦) factors through Shv(C).

/C . If C(0)

Let X = θ−1 Shv(C), so that N(A◦) can be identiﬁed with the collection of S′-local objects of X, where
S′ is the collection of all morphisms in X which belong to S. Then θ induces an equivalence N(A◦) →
θ(S′)−1 Shv(C). We now observe that a morphism f in X belongs to S′ if and only if θ(f ) is an ∞-connective
morphism in Shv(C) (since the condition of being a local equivalence can be tested on homotopy sheaves).
It follows that θ(S′)−1 Shv(C) = Shv(C)∧, as desired.

Remark 6.5.2.15. In [78], the authors discuss a generalization of Jardine’s construction, in which the
category C is replaced by a simplicial category. Proposition 6.5.2.14 holds in this more general situation as
well.

We conclude this section with a few remarks about localizations of an ∞-topos X. In §6.2.1 we introduced
the class of topological localizations of X, consisting of those left exact localizations which can be obtained
by inverting monomorphisms in X. The hypercompletion X∧ is, in some sense, at the other extreme: it is
obtained by inverting the ∞-connective morphisms in X, which are never monomorphisms unless they are
already equivalences. In fact, X∧ is the maximal (left exact) localization of X which can be obtained without
inverting monomorphisms:

530

Proposition 6.5.2.16. Let X and Y be ∞-topoi, and let f ∗ : X → Y be a left exact, colimit preserving
functor. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) For every monomorphism u in X, if f ∗u is an equivalence in Y, then u is an equivalence in X.

(2) For every morphism u ∈ X, if f ∗u is an equivalence in Y, then f is ∞-connective.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (2) is satisﬁed. If u is a monomorphism and f ∗u is an equivalence in Y, then u
is ∞-connective. In particular, u is both a monomorphism and an eﬀective epimorphism, and therefore an
equivalence in X. This proves (1). Conversely, suppose that (1) is satisﬁed, and let u : X → Z be an arbitrary
morphism in X such that f ∗(u) is an equivalence. We will prove by induction on n that u is n-connective.

We ﬁrst consider the case n = 0. Choose a factorization

u′

>~~~~~~~

Y

u

u′′

(cid:31)@@@@@@@

/ Z

where u′ is an eﬀective epimorphism, and u′′ is a monomorphism. Since f ∗u is an equivalence, Corollary
6.2.3.12 implies that f ∗u′′ is an eﬀective epimorphism. Since f ∗u′′ is also a monomorphism (in virtue of our
assumption that f is left exact), we conclude that f ∗u′′ is an equivalence. Applying (1), we deduce that u′′
is an equivalence, so that u is an eﬀective epimorphism as desired.

Now suppose n > 0. According to Proposition 6.5.1.18, it will suﬃce to show that the diagonal map
δ : X → X ×Z X is (n − 1)-connective. By the inductive hypothesis, it will suﬃce to prove that f ∗(δ) is an
equivalence in Y. We conclude by observing that f ∗ is left exact, so we can identify δ with the diagonal map
associated to the equivalence f ∗(u) : f ∗X → f ∗Z.

Deﬁnition 6.5.2.17. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let Y ⊆ X be an accessible left exact localization of X. We
will say that Y is an cotopological localization of X if the left adjoint L : X → Y to the inclusion of Y in X
satisﬁes the equivalent conditions of Proposition 6.5.2.16.

Remark 6.5.2.18. Let f ∗ : X → Y be the left adjoint of a geometric morphism between ∞-topoi, and
suppose that the equivalent conditions of Proposition 6.5.2.16 are satisﬁed. Let u : X → Z be a morphism
in X, and choose a factorization

u′

(cid:31)@@@@@@@

where u′ is an eﬀective epimorphism and u′′ is a monomorphism. Then u′′ is an equivalence if and only if
f ∗(u′′) is an equivalence. Applying Corollary 6.2.3.12, we conclude that u is an eﬀective epimorphism if and
only if f ∗(u) is an eﬀective epimorphism.

The hypercompletion X∧ of an ∞-topos X can be characterized as the maximal cotopological localization
of X (that is, the cotopological localization which is obtained by inverting as many morphisms as possible).
According to our next result, every localization can be obtained by combining topological and cotopological
localizations:

Proposition 6.5.2.19. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let X′′ ⊆ X be an accessible, left exact localization of X.
Then there exists a topological localization X′ ⊆ X such that X′′ ⊆ X′ is a cotopological localization of X′.

Proof. Let L : X → X′′ be a left adjoint to the inclusion, let S be the collection of all monomorphisms u in
X such that Lu is an equivalence, and let X′ = S−1 X be the collection of S-local objects of X. Since L is left
exact, S is stable under pullbacks and therefore determines a topological localization of X. By construction,
we have X′′ ⊆ X′. The restriction L| X′ exhibits X′′ as an accessible left exact localization of X′. Let u be a

531

(cid:31)

(cid:31)

monomorphism in X′ such that Lu is an equivalence. Then u is a monomorphism in X, so that u ∈ S. Since
X′ consists of S-local objects, we conclude that u is an equivalence. It follows that X′′ is a cotopological
localization of X′, as desired.

Remark 6.5.2.20. It is easy to see that the factorization of Proposition 6.5.2.19 is essentially uniquely
determined: more precisely, X′ is unique provided that we assume that it is stable under equivalences in X.

Combining Proposition 6.5.2.19 with Remark 7.2.1.16, we see that every ∞-topos X can be obtained in

following way:

(1) Begin with the ∞-category P(C) of presheaves on some small ∞-category C.

(2) Choose a Grothendieck topology on C: this is equivalent to choosing a left exact localization of the

underlying topos Disc(P(C)) = SethCop

.

(3) Form the associated topological localization Shv(C) ⊆ P(C), which can be described as the pullback

in RTop.

P(C) ×P(N(hC)) Shv(N(hC))

(4) Form a cotopological localization of Shv(C) by inverting some class of ∞-connective morphisms of

Shv(C).

Remark 6.5.2.21. Let X be an ∞-topos. The collection of all ∞-connective morphisms in X is saturated.
It follows from Proposition 5.5.5.7 that there exists a factorization system (SL, SR) on X, where SL is the
collection of all ∞-connective morphisms in X. We will say that a morphism in X is hypercomplete if it
belongs to SR. Unwinding the deﬁnitions (and using the fact that a morphism in X/Y is ∞-connective if
and only if its image in X is ∞-connective), we conclude that a morphism f : X → Y is hypercomplete if
and only if it is hypercomplete when viewed as an object of the ∞-topos X/Y (see §6.5.2).

Using Proposition 5.2.8.6, we deduce that the collection of hypercomplete morphisms in X is stable under

limits and the formation of pullback squares.

Remark 6.5.2.22. Let X be an ∞-topos. The condition that a morphism f : X → Y be hypercomplete is
local: that is, if {Yα → Y } is a collection of morphisms which determine an eﬀective epimorphism
Yα → Y ,
and each of the induced maps fα : X ×Y Yα → Yα is hypercomplete, then f is hypercomplete. To prove
α X/Yα (since coproducts in X are disjoint), so it is easy to see that
this, we set Y0 =
the induced map f ′ : X ×Y Y0 → Y0 is hypercomplete. Let Y• be the simplicial object of X given by the
ˇCech nerve of the eﬀective epimorphism Y0 → Y . For every map Z → Y , let Z• be the simplicial object
described by the formula Zn = Yn ×Y Z (equivalently, Z• is the ˇCech nerve of the eﬀective epimorphism
Z ×Y Y0 → Z). Using Remark 6.5.2.21, we conclude that each of the maps Xn → Yn is hypercomplete.

so the induced map

6.5.3 Hypercoverings
Let X be an ∞-topos. In §6.5.2, we deﬁned the hypercompletion X∧ ⊆ X to be the left exact localization of
X obtained by inverting the ∞-connective morphisms. In this section, we will give an alternative description
of the hypercomplete objects X ∈ X∧: they are precisely those objects of X which satisfy a descent condition
with respect to hypercoverings (Theorem 6.5.3.12). We begin by reviewing the deﬁnition of a hypercovering.
Let X be a topological space, and let F be a presheaf of sets on X. To construct the sheaf associated to

F, it is natural to consider the presheaf F+, deﬁned by

F+ = lim
−→
U

lim
←−
V ∈U

F(V ).

Here the direct limit is taken over all sieves U which cover U . There is an obvious map F → F+, which is an
isomorphism whenever F is a sheaf. Moreover, F+ is “closer” to being a sheaf than F is. More precisely, F+
is always a separated presheaf: two sections of F+ which agree locally automatically coincide. If F is itself
a separated presheaf, then F+ is a sheaf.

For a general presheaf F, we need to apply the above construction twice to construct the associated sheaf
(F+)+. To understand the problem, let us try to prove that F+ is a sheaf (to see where the argument breaks
down). Suppose given an open covering X =

Uα, and a collection of sections sα ∈ F+(Uα) such that

sα|Uα ∩ Uβ = sβ|Uα ∩ Uβ.

S

Reﬁning the covering Uα if necessary, we may assume that each sα is the image of some section tα ∈ F(Uα).
However, the equation

tα|Uα ∩ Uβ = tβ|Uα ∩ Uβ
only holds locally on Uα ∩ Uβ, so the sections tα do not necessarily determine a global section of F+. To
summarize: the freedom to consider arbitrarily ﬁne open covers U = {Uα} is not enough; we also need to be
able to reﬁne the intersections Uα ∩ Uβ. This leads very naturally to the notion of a hypercovering. Roughly
speaking, a hypercovering of X consists of an open covering {Uα} of X, an open covering of {Vαβγ} of each
intersection Uα ∩ Uβ, and analogous data associated to more complicated intersections (see Deﬁnition 6.5.3.2
for a more precise formulation).

In classical sheaf theory, there are two ways to construct the sheaf associated to a presheaf F:

(1) One can apply the construction F 7→ F+ twice.

(2) Using the theory of hypercoverings, one can proceed directly by deﬁning

F†(U ) = lim
−→
U

lim
←−

F(V )

where the direct limit is now taken over arbitrary hypercoverings U.

In higher category theory, the diﬀerence between these two approaches becomes more prominent. For
example, suppose that F is not a presheaf of sets, but a presheaf of groupoids on X. In this case, one can
construct the associated sheaf of groupoids using either approach. However, in the case of approach (1),
it is necessary to apply the construction F 7→ F+ three times: the ﬁrst application guarantees that the
automorphism groups of sections of F are separated presheaves, the second guarantees that they are sheaves,
and the third guarantees that F itself satisﬁes descent. More generally, if F is a sheaf of n-truncated spaces,
then the sheaﬁﬁcation of F via approach (1) takes place in (n + 2)-stages.

When we pass to the case n = ∞, the situation becomes more complicated. If F is a presheaf of spaces
on X, then it is not reasonable to expect to obtain a sheaf by applying the construction F 7→ F+ any ﬁnite
number of times. In fact, it is not obvious that F+ is any closer than F to being a sheaf. Nevertheless, this
is true: we can construct the sheaﬁﬁcation of F via a transﬁnite iteration of the construction F 7→ F+. More
precisely, we deﬁne a transﬁnite sequence of presheaves

F(0) → F(1) → . . .

533

as follows:

(i) Let F(0) = F.

(ii) For every ordinary α, let F(α + 1) = F(α)+.

(iii) For every limit ordinal λ, let F(λ) = lim
−→α

F(α), where α ranges over ordinals less than λ.

One can show that the above construction converges, in the sense that F(α) is a sheaf for α ≫ 0 (and
therefore F(α) ≃ F(β) for β ≥ α). Moreover, F(α) is universal among sheaves of spaces which admits a map
from F.

Alternatively, one use the construction F 7→ F† to construct a sheaf of spaces from F in a single step.
The universal property asserted above guarantees the existence of a morphism of sheaves θ : F(α) → F†.
Instead, θ realizes F† as the hypercompletion
However, the morphism θ is generally not an equivalence.
of F(α) in the ∞-topos Shv(X). We will not prove this statement directly, but will instead establish a
reformulation (Corollary 6.5.3.13) which does not make reference to the sheaﬁﬁcation constructions outlined
above.

Before we can introduce the deﬁnition of a hypercovering, we need to review some simplicial terminology.

Notation 6.5.3.1. For each n ≥ 0, let ∆≤n denote the full subcategory of ∆ spanned by the set of objects
{[0], . . . , [n]}. If X is a presentable ∞-category, the restriction functor

skn : X∆ → Fun(N(∆≤n)op, X)

has a right adjoint, given by right Kan extension along the inclusion N(∆≤n)op ⊆ N(∆)op. Let coskn : X∆ →
X∆ be the composition of skn with its right adjoint. We will refer to coskn as the n-coskeleton functor.

Deﬁnition 6.5.3.2. Let X be an ∞-topos. A simplicial object U• ∈ X∆ is a hypercovering of X if, for each
n ≥ 0, the unit map

Un → (coskn−1 U•)n

is an eﬀective epimorphism. We will say that U• is an eﬀective hypercovering of X if the colimit of U• is a
ﬁnal object of X.

Remark 6.5.3.3. More informally, a simplicial object U• ∈ X∆ is a hypercovering of X if each of the
associated maps

U0 → 1X

U1 → U0 × U0

U2 → . . .

is an eﬀective epimorphism.

Lemma 6.5.3.4. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let U• be a simplicial object in X. Let L : X → X∧ be a left
adjoint to the inclusion. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The simplicial object U• is a hypercovering of X.

(2) The simplicial object L ◦ U• is a hypercovering of X∧.

Proof. Since L is left exact, we can identify L ◦ coskn U• with coskn(L ◦ U•). The desired result now follows
from Remark 6.5.2.18.

Lemma 6.5.3.5. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let U be an ∞-connective object of X. Let U• be the constant
simplicial object with value U . Then U• is a hypercovering of X.

534

Proof. Using Lemma 6.5.3.4, we can reduce to the case where X is hypercomplete. Then U ≃ 1X, so that
U• is equivalent to the constant functor with value 1X, and is therefore a ﬁnal object of X∆. For each n ≥ 0,
the coskeleton functor coskn−1 preserves small limits, so coskn−1 U• is also a ﬁnal object of U•. It follows
that the unit map U• → coskn−1 U• is an equivalence.

Notation 6.5.3.6. Let ∆s be the subcategory of ∆ with the same objects, but where the morphisms are
given by injective order preserving maps between nonempty linearly ordered sets. If X is an ∞-category, we
will refer to a diagram N(∆s)op → X as a semisimplicial object of X.

Lemma 6.5.3.7. The inclusion N(∆op

s ) ⊆ N(∆op) is coﬁnal.

Proof. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it will suﬃce to prove that for every n ≥ 0, the category C =
∆s ×∆ ∆/[n] has weakly contractible nerve. To prove this, we let F : C → C be the constant functor
taking value given by the inclusion [0] ⊆ [n], and G : C → C the functor which carries an arbitrary map
[m] → [n] to the induced map [0]

[m] → [n]. We have natural transformations of functors

`

F → G ← idC .

Let X be the topological space | N(C)|. The natural transformations above show that the identity map idX
is homotopic to a constant, so that X is contractible as desired.

Consequently, if U• is a simplicial object in an ∞-category X, and U s
semisimplicial object, then we can identify colimits of U• with colimits of U s
• .

• = U•| N(∆op

s ) is the associated

We will say that a simplicial object U• in an ∞-category X is n-coskeletal if it is a right Kan extension
≤n). Similarly, we will say that a semisimplicial object of U• of X is n-coskeletal if

of its restriction to N(∆op
it is a right Kan extension of its restriction to N(∆op

s,≤n), where ∆s,≤n = ∆s ×∆ ∆≤n.

Lemma 6.5.3.8. Let X be an ∞-category, let U• be a simplicial object of X, and let U s
associated semisimplicial object. Then U• is n-coskeletal if and only if U s
• is n-coskeletal.

• = U•| N(∆op

s ) the

Proof. It will suﬃce to show that, for each ∆m ∈ ∆, the nerve of the inclusion

(∆s)/[m] ×∆s ∆s,≤n ⊆ ∆/[m] ×∆ ∆≤n

is coﬁnal. Let θ : [m′] → [m] be an object of ∆/[m] ×∆ ∆≤n. We let C denote the category of all factorizations

[m′] θ′

→ [m′′] θ′′

→ [m]

for θ such that θ′′ is a monomorphism and m′′ ≤ n. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it will suﬃce to prove
that N(C) is weakly contractible (for every choice of θ). We now simply observe that C has an initial object
(given by the unique a factorization where θ′ is an epimorphism).

Lemma 6.5.3.9 ([20]). Let X be an ∞-topos, and let U• be an n-coskeletal hypercovering of X. Then U• is
eﬀective.

Proof. We will prove this result by induction on n. If n = 0, then U• can be identiﬁed with the underlying
groupoid of the ˇCech nerve of the map θ : U0 → 1X, where 1X is a ﬁnal object of X. Since U• is a
hypercovering, θ is an eﬀective epimorphism, so the ˇCech nerve of θ is a colimit diagram and the desired
result follows. Let us therefore assume that n > 0. Let V• = coskn−1 U•, and let f• : U• → V• be the
adjunction map. For each m ≥ 0, the map fm : Um → Vm is a composition of ﬁnitely many pullbacks of fn.
Since U• is a hypercovering, fn is an eﬀective epimorphism, so each fm is also an eﬀective epimorphism. We
also observe that fm is an equivalence for m < n.

Let W+ : N(∆+ × ∆)op → X be a ˇCech nerve of f• (formed in the ∞-category X∆ of simplicial objects
of X). We observe that W+| N({∅} × ∆)op can be identiﬁed with V•. Since V• is an (n − 1)-coskeletal
hypercovering of X, the inductive hypothesis implies that any colimit |V•| is a ﬁnal object of X. The inclusion

535

N({∅} × ∆)op ⊆ N(∆+ × ∆)op is coﬁnal (being a product of N(∆)op with the inclusion of a ﬁnal object into
N(∆+)op ), so we may identify colimits of W+ with colimits of V•. It follows that any colimit of W+ is a
ﬁnal object of X. We next observe that each of the augmented simplicial objects W+| N(∆+ ×{[m]})op is a
ˇCech nerve of fm, and therefore a colimit diagram (since fm is an eﬀective epimorphism). Applying Lemma
4.3.3.9, we conclude that W+ is a left Kan extension of the bisimplicial object W = W+| N(∆ × ∆)op.
According to Lemma 4.3.2.7, we can identify colimits of W+ with colimits of W , so any colimit of W is a
ﬁnal object of X.

Let U s

Let D• : N(∆op) → X be the simplicial object of X obtained by composing W with the diagonal map
δ : N(∆op) → N(∆ × ∆)op. According to Lemma 5.5.8.4, δ is coﬁnal. We may therefore identify colimits of
W with colimits of D•, so that any colimit |D•| of D• is a ﬁnal object of X.

• = U•| N(∆op

• = D•| N(∆op

s ), and let Ds

• in the ∞-
category of semisimplicial objects of X. According to Lemma 6.5.3.7, we can identify colimits of Ds
• with
colimits of D•. It will follow that any colimit of U s
• is a retract of a ﬁnal object of X, and therefore itself
ﬁnal. Applying Lemma 6.5.3.7 again, we will conclude that any colimit of U• is a ﬁnal object of X, and the
proof will be complete.
We observe that Ds

• is the result of composing W with the (opposite of the nerve of the) diagonal functor

s ). We will prove that U s

• is a retract of Ds

δs : ∆s → ∆ × ∆ .

Similarly, the semisimplicial object U s

• is obtained from W via the composition

ǫ : ∆s ⊆ ∆ ≃ {[0]} × ∆ ⊆ ∆ × ∆ .

There is a obvious natural transformation of functors δs → ǫ, which yields a map of semisimplicial objects
θ : U s

•. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that there exists a map

homotopy inverse to f is now obvious (choose any of the (n + 1)-projections from Y onto X).

Lemma 6.5.3.10. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let f• : U• → V• be a natural transformation between simplicial
objects of X. Suppose that, for each k ≤ n, the map fk : Uk → Vk is an equivalence. Then the induced map
|f•| : |U•| → |V•| of colimits is n-connective.

Proof. Choose a left exact localization functor L : P(C) → X. Without loss of generality, we may suppose
that f• = L ◦ f •, where f • : U • → V • is a transformation between simplicial objects of P(C), where f k is
an equivalence for k ≤ n. Since L preserves colimits and n-connectivity (Proposition 6.5.1.16), it will suﬃce
to prove that |f•| is n-connective. Using Propositions 6.5.1.12 and 5.5.6.28, we see that |f•| is n-connective
if and only if, for each object C ∈ C, the induced morphism in S is n-connective. In other words, we may
assume without loss of generality that X = S.

• → V ′

According to Proposition 4.2.4.4, we may assume that f• is obtained by taking the simplicial nerve of a
• between simplicial objects in the ordinary category Kan. Without loss of generality, we

Lemma 6.5.3.11. Let X be an ∞-topos, let U• be a hypercovering of X. Then the colimit |U•| is ∞-
connective.

Proof. We will prove that θ is n-connective for every n ≥ 0. Let V• = coskn+1 U•, and let u : U• → V• be
the adjunction map. Lemma 6.5.3.10 asserts that the induced map |U•| → |V•| is n-connective, and Lemma
6.5.3.9 asserts that |V•| is a ﬁnal object of X. It follows that |U•| ∈ X is n-connective, as desired.

The preceding results lead to an easy characterization of the class of hypercomplete ∞-topoi:

(1) For every X ∈ X, every hypercovering U• of X/X is eﬀective.

(2) The ∞-topos X is hypercomplete.

Proof. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed. Let f : U → X be an ∞-connective morphism in X, and let f• be the
constant simplicial object of X/X with value f . According to Lemma 6.5.3.5, f is a hypercovering of X/X .
Invoking (1), we conclude that f ≃ |f•| is a ﬁnal object of X/X ; in other words, f is an equivalence. This
proves that (1) ⇒ (2).

Conversely, suppose that X is hypercomplete. Let X ∈ X be an object and U• a hypercovering of X/X .
Then Lemma 6.5.3.11 implies that |U•| is an ∞-connective object of X/X . Since X is hypercomplete, we
conclude that |U•| is a ﬁnal object of X/X , so that U• is eﬀective.

Corollary 6.5.3.13 (Dugger-Hollander-Isaksen [20], To¨en-Vezzosi [78]). Let X be an ∞-topos. For each
X ∈ X and each hypercovering U• of X/X , let |U•| be the associated morphism of X (which has target X).
Let S denote the collection of all such morphisms |U•|. Then X∧ = S−1 X. In other words, an object of X is
hypercomplete if and only if it is S-local.

let L : X → Y be an arbitrary left
Remark 6.5.3.14. One can generalize Corollary 6.5.3.13 as follows:
exact localization of ∞-topoi, and let S be the collection of all morphisms of the form |U•|, where U• is a
simplicial object of X/X such that L◦U• is an eﬀective hypercovering of Y/LX. Then L induces an equivalence
S−1 X → Y.

It follows that every ∞-topos can be obtained by starting with an ∞-category of presheaves P(C), selecting
a collection of augmented simplicial objects U +
• , and inverting the corresponding maps |U•| → U−1. The
speciﬁcation of the desired class of augmented simplicial objects can be viewed as a kind of “generalized
topology” on C, in which one speciﬁes not only the covering sieves but also the collection of hypercoverings
which are to become eﬀective after localization.
It seems plausible that this notion of topology can be
described more directly in terms of the ∞-category C, but we will not pursue the matter further.

6.5.4 Descent versus Hyperdescent

Let X be a topological space, and let U(X) denote the category of open subsets of X. The category U(X)
is equipped with a Grothendieck topology in which the covering sieves on U are those sieves {Uα ⊆ U }
α Uα. We may therefore consider the ∞-topos Shv(N(U(X))), which we will call the
such that U =
∞-topos of sheaves on X and denote by Shv(X) In §6.5.2 we discussed an alternative theory of sheaves
on X, which can be obtained either through Jardine’s local model structure on the category of simplicial
presheaves or by passing to the hypercompletion Shv(X)∧ of Shv(X). According to Theorem 6.5.3.12,
Shv(X)∧ is distinguished from Shv(X) in that objects of Shv(X)∧ are required to satisfy a descent condition
for arbitrary hypercoverings of X, while objects of Shv(X) are required to satisfy a descent condition only
for ordinary coverings.

S

Warning 6.5.4.1. The notation Shv(X) will always represent the ∞-category of S-valued sheaves on X,
rather than the ordinary category of set-valued sheaves. If we need to indicate the latter, we will denote it
by ShvSet(X).

The ∞-topos Shv(X)∧ seems to have received more attention than Shv(X) in the literature (though
there is some discussion of Shv(X) in [20] and [78]). We would like to make the case that for most purposes,
Shv(X) has better properties. A large part of §7 will be devoted to justifying some of the claims made below.

(1) In §6.4.5, we saw that the construction

X 7→ Shv(X)

could be interpreted as a right adjoint to the functor which associates to every ∞-topos Y the underlying
locale of subobjects of the ﬁnal object of Y. In other words, Shv(X) occupies a universal position among
∞-topoi which are related to the original space X.

transformation

of functors between the derived categories of (left-bounded) complexes of (abelian) sheaves on X and
on S′. The proper base change theorem asserts that this transformation is an equivalence whenever
the map π is proper.
The functors ψ∗, ψ′∗, π∗, and π′
and on their hypercompletions. Moreover, one has a base change map

∗ can be deﬁned on the ∞-topoi Shv(X), Shv(X ′), Shv(S), and Shv(S′),

ψ∗π∗ → π′∗ψ′∗

in this nonabelian situation as well.

It is natural to ask if the base change transformation is an equivalence when π is proper. It turns out
that this is false if we work with hypercomplete ∞-topoi. Let us sketch a counterexample:

Counterexample 6.5.4.2. Let Q denote the Hilbert cube [0, 1]× [0, 1]× . . .. For each i, we let Qi ≃ Q
denote “all but the ﬁrst i” factors of Q, so that Q = [0, 1]i × Qi.
We construct a sheaf of spaces F on X = Q × [0, 1] as follows. Begin with the empty stack. Adjoin to
it two sections, deﬁned over the open sets [0, 1) × Q1 × [0, 1) and (0, 1] × Q1 × [0, 1). These sections
both restrict to give sections of F over the open set (0, 1) × Q1 × [0, 1). We next adjoin paths between
these sections, deﬁned over the smaller open sets (0, 1) × [0, 1) × Q2 × [0, 1
2 ) and (0, 1) × (0, 1] × Q2 ×
[0, 1
2 ), so we next
adjoin two homotopies between these paths over the open sets (0, 1) × (0, 1) × [0, 1) × Q3 × [0, 1
3 ) and
(0, 1) × (0, 1) × (0, 1] × Q3 × [0, 1
3 ). Continuing in this way, we obtain a sheaf F. On the closed subset
Q × {0} ⊂ X, the sheaf F is ∞-connective by construction, and therefore its hypercompletion admits a
global section. However, the hypercompletion of F does not admit a global section in any neighborhood
of Q × {0}, since such a neighborhood must contain Q × [0, 1
n ) for n ≫ 0 and the higher homotopies
required for the construction of a section are eventually not globally deﬁned.

2 ). These paths are both deﬁned on the smaller open set (0, 1) × (0, 1) × Q2 × [0, 1

However, in the case where π is a proper map, the base-change map

ψ∗π∗ → π′

∗ψ′∗

is an equivalence of functors from Shv(X) to Shv(S′). One may regard this fact as a nonabelian
generalization of the classical proper-base change theorem. We refer the reader to §7.3 for a precise
statement and proof.

Remark 6.5.4.3. A similar issue arises in classical sheaf theory if one chooses to work with unbounded
complexes. In [72], Spaltenstein deﬁnes a derived category of unbounded complexes of sheaves on X,
where X is a topological space. His deﬁnition forces all quasi-isomorphisms to become invertible,
which is analogous to procedure of obtaining X∧ from X by inverting the ∞-connective morphisms.
Spaltenstein’s work shows that one can extend the deﬁnitions of all of the basic objects and functors.
However, it turns out that the theorems do not all extend: in particular, one does not have the proper
base change theorem in Spaltenstein’s setting (Counterexample 6.5.4.2 can be adapted to the setting of
complexes of abelian sheaves). The problem may be rectiﬁed by imposing weaker descent conditions,
which do not invert all quasi-isomorphisms; we will give a more detailed discussion in [50].

(3) The ∞-topos Shv(X) often has better ﬁniteness properties than Shv(X)∧. Recall that a topological
space X is coherent if the collection of compact open subsets of X is stable under ﬁnite intersections,
and forms a basis for the topology of X.

Proposition 6.5.4.4. Let X be a coherent topological space. Then the ∞-category Shv(X) is compactly
generated: that is, Shv(X) is generated under ﬁltered colimits by its compact objects.

Proof. Let Uc(X) be the partially ordered set of compact open subsets of X, let Pc(X) = P(N(Uc(X))),
and let Shvc(X) be the full subcategory of Pc(X) spanned by those presheaves F with the following
properties:

(1) The object F(∅) ∈ C is ﬁnal.

(2) For every pair of compact open sets U, V ⊆ X, the associated diagram

F(U ∩ V )

F(U )

F(V )

/ F(U ∪ V )

is a pullback.

In §7.3.5, we will prove that the restriction functor Shv(X) → Shvc(X) is an equivalence of ∞-categories
(Theorem 7.3.5.2). It will therefore suﬃce to prove that Shvc(X) is compactly generated.
Using Lemmas 5.5.4.19, 5.5.4.17, and 5.5.4.18, we conclude that Shvc(X) is an accessible localization
of Pc(X). Let X be a compact object of Pc(X). We observe that X and LX co-represent the same
functor on Shvc(X). Proposition 5.3.3.3 implies that the subcategory Shvc(X) ⊆ Pc(X) is stable under
ﬁltered colimits in Pc(X). It follows that LX is a compact object of Shv0(X). Since Pc(X) is generated
under ﬁltered colimits by its compact objects (Proposition 5.3.5.12), we conclude that Shvc(X) has
the same property.

Remark 6.5.4.5. In the situation of Proposition 6.5.4.4, we can give an explicit description of the class
of compact objects of Shv(X). Namely, they are precisely those sheaves F whose stalks are compact
objects of S, and which are locally constant along a suitable stratiﬁcation of X. In other words, we
may interpret Proposition 6.5.4.4 as asserting that there is a good theory of constructible sheaves on
X.

It is not possible to replace to Shv(X) by Shv(X)∧ in the statement of Proposition 6.5.4.4.

Counterexample 6.5.4.6. Let S = {x, y, z} be a topological space consisting of three points, with
topology generated by the open subsets S+ = {x, y} ⊂ S and S− = {x, z} ⊂ S. Let X = S × S × . . .
be a product of inﬁnitely many copies of S. Then X is a coherent topological space. We will show
that the global sections functor Γ : Shv(X)∧ → S does not commute with ﬁltered colimits, so that the
ﬁnal object of Shv(X)∧ is not compact. A more elaborate version of the same argument shows that
Shv(X)∧ contains no compact objects other than its initial object.

To show that Γ does not commute with ﬁltered colimits, we use a variant on the construction of
Counterexample 6.5.4.2. We deﬁne a sequence of sheaves

as follows. Let F0 be generated by sections

F0 → F1 → . . .

F0 → F1 → F2 → . . .

whose colimit F∞ ∈ Shv(X)∧ admits a section (since we allow descent with respect to hypercoverings).
However, none of the individual sheaves Fn admits a global section.

Remark 6.5.4.7. The analogue of Proposition 6.5.4.4 fails, in general, if we replace the coherent
topological space X by a coherent topos. For example, we cannot take X to be the topos of ´etale
sheaves on an algebraic variety. However, it turns out that the analogue Proposition 6.5.4.4 is true for
the topos of Nisnevich sheaves on an algebraic variety; we refer the reader to [50] for details.

Remark 6.5.4.8. A point of an ∞-topos X is a geometric morphism p∗ : S → X, where S denotes
the ∞-category of spaces (which is a ﬁnal object of RTop, in virtue of Proposition 6.3.4.1). We say
that X has enough points if, for every morphism f : X → Y in X having the property that p∗(f ) is an
equivalence for every point p of X, f is itself an equivalence in X. If f is ∞-connective, then every stalk
p∗(f ) is ∞-connective, hence an equivalence by Whitehead’s theorem. Consequently, if X has enough
points, then it is hypercomplete.

In classical topos theory, Deligne’s version of the G¨odel completeness theorem (see [53]) asserts that
every coherent topos has enough points. Counterexample 6.5.4.6 shows that there exist coherent
topological spaces with Shv(X)∧ 6= Shv(X), so that Shv(X) does not necessarily have enough points.
Consequently, Deligne’s theorem does not hold in the ∞-categorical context.

(4) Let k be a ﬁeld, and let C denote the category of chain complexes of k-vector spaces. Via the Dold-Kan
correspondence we may regard C as a simplicial category. We let Mod(k) = N(C) denote the simplicial
nerve. We will refer to Mod(k) as the ∞-category of k-modules; it is a presentable ∞-category which
we will discuss at greater length in [50].

Let X be a compact topological space, and choose a functorial injective resolution

F → I 0(F) → I 1(F) → . . .

on the category of sheaves F of k-vector spaces on X. For every open subset U on X, we let kU denote
the constant sheaf on U with value k, extended by zero to X. Let HBM (U ) = Γ(X, I •(kU ))∨, the dual
of the complex of global sections of the injective resolution I •(kU ). Then HBM (U ) is a complex of
k-vector spaces, whose homologies are precisely the Borel-Moore homology of U with coeﬃcients in k
(in other words, they are the dual spaces of the compactly supported cohomology groups of U ). The
assignment

U 7→ HBM (U )

determines a presheaf on X with values in the ∞-category Mod(k).

541

In view of the existence of excision exact sequences for Borel-Moore homology, it is natural to suppose
that HBM (U ) is actually a sheaf on X with values in Mod(k). This is true provided that the notion of
“sheaf” is suitably interpreted: namely, HBM extends (in an essentially unique fashion) to a colimit-
preserving functor

φ : Shv(X) → Mod(k)op.
(In other words, the functor U 7→ HBM (U ) determines a Mod(k)-valued sheaf on X in the sense of
Deﬁnition 7.3.3.1.) However, the sheaf HBM is not necessarily hypercomplete, in the sense that φ does
not necessarily factor through Shv(X)∧.

Counterexample 6.5.4.9. There exists a compact Hausdorﬀ space X and a hypercovering U• of X
such that the natural map HBM (X) → lim
HBM (U•) is not an equivalence. Let X be the Hilbert cube
←−
Q = [0, 1] × [0, 1] × . . . (more generally, we could take X to be any nonempty Hilbert cube manifold).
It is proven in [15] that every point of X has arbitrarily small neighborhoods which are homeomorphic
to Q × [0, 1). Consequently, there exists a hypercovering U• of X, where each Un is a disjoint union
of open subsets of X homeomorphic to Q × [0, 1). The Borel-Moore homology of every Un vanishes;
HBM (U•) is zero. However, the (degree zero) Borel-Moore homology of X itself does
consequently, lim
←−
not vanish, since X is nonempty and compact.

Borel-Moore homology is a very useful tool in the study of a locally compact space X, and its descent
properties (in other words, the existence of various Mayer-Vietoris sequences) is very naturally encoded
in the statement that HBM is a k-module in the ∞-topos Shv(X) (in other words, a sheaf on X with
values in Mod(k)); however, this k-module generally does not lie in Shv(X)∧. We see from this example
that non-hypercomplete sheaves (with values in Mod(k), in this case) on X often arise naturally in the
study of inﬁnite-dimensional spaces.

(5) Let X be a topological space, and f : Shv(X) → Shv(∗) ≃ S the geometric morphism induced by
the projection X → ∗. Let K be a Kan complex, regarded as an object of S. Then π0f∗f ∗K is a
natural deﬁnition of the sheaf cohomology of X with coeﬃcients in K. If X is paracompact, then the
cohomology set deﬁned above is naturally isomorphic to the set [X, |K|] of homotopy classes of maps
from X into the geometric realization |K|; we will give a proof of this statement in §7.1. The analogous
statement fails if we replace Shv(X) by Shv(X)∧.

(6) Let X be a topological space. Combining Remark 6.5.2.2 with Proposition 6.5.2.14, we deduce that
Shv(X)∧ has enough points, and that Shv(X)∧ = Shv(X) if and only if Shv(X) has enough points.
The possible failure of Whitehead’s theorem in Shv(X) may be viewed either as a bug or a feature.
it allows us to reduce many
The existence of enough points for Shv(X) is extremely convenient;
statements about the ∞-topos Shv(X) to statements about the ∞-topos S of spaces, where we can
apply classical homotopy theory. On the other hand, if Shv(X) does not have enough points, then
there is the possibility that it detects certain global phenomena which cannot be properly understood
by restricting to points. Let us consider an example from geometric topology. A map f : X → Y of
compact metric spaces is called cell-like if each ﬁber Xy = X ×Y {y} has trivial shape (see [18]). This
notion has good formal properties provided that we restrict our attention to metric spaces which are
absolute neighborhood retracts. In the general case, the theory of cell-like maps can be badly behaved:
for example, a composition of cell-like maps need not be cell-like.

The language of ∞-topoi provides a convenient formalism for discussing the problem. In §7.3.6, we will
introduce the notion of a cell-like morphism p∗ : X → Y between ∞-topoi. By deﬁnition, p∗ is cell-like
if it is proper and if the unit map u : F → p∗p∗ F is an equivalence for each F ∈ Y. A cell-like map
p : X → Y of compact metric spaces need not give rise to a cell-like morphism p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ).
The hypothesis that each ﬁber Xy has trivial shape ensures that the unit u : F → p∗p∗ F is an
equivalence after passing to stalks at each point y ∈ Y . This implies only that u is ∞-connective, and
in general u need not be an equivalence.

542

Remark 6.5.4.10. It is tempting to try to evade the problem described above by working instead
with the hypercomplete ∞-topoi Shv(X)∧ and Shv(Y )∧.
In this case, we can test whether or not
u : F → p∗p∗ F is an equivalence by passing to stalks. However, since the proper base change theorem
does not hold in the hypercomplete context, the stalk (p∗p∗ F)y is not generally equivalent to the global
sections of p∗ F |Xy. Thus, we still encounter diﬃculties if we want to deduce global consequences from
information about the individual ﬁbers Xy.

(7) The counterexamples described in this section have one feature in common: the underlying space X is
inﬁnite-dimensional. In fact, this is necessary: if the space X is ﬁnite-dimensional (in a suitable sense),
then the ∞-topos Shv(X) is hypercomplete (Corollary 7.2.1.12). This ﬁnite-dimensionality condition
on X is satisﬁed in many of the situations to which the theory of simplicial presheaves is commonly
applied, such as the Nisnevich topology on a scheme of ﬁnite Krull dimension.

543

Chapter 7

Higher Topos Theory in Topology

In this chapter, we will sketch three applications of the theory of ∞-topoi to the study classical topology.
We begin in §7.1, by showing that if X is a paracompact topological space, then the ∞-topos Shv(X) of
sheaves on X can be interpreted as a homotopy theory of topological spaces Y equipped with a map to X.
We will deduce, as an application, that if p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(∗) is the geometric morphism induced by the
projection X → ∗, then the composition p∗p∗ is equivalent to the functor

K 7→ K X

from (compactly generated) topological spaces to itself.

Our second application is to the dimension theory of topological spaces. There are many diﬀerent
notions of dimension for a topological space X, including the notion of covering dimension (when X is
paracompact), Krull dimension (when X is Noetherian), and cohomological dimension. We will deﬁne the
homotopy dimension of an ∞-topos X, which specializes to the covering dimension when X = Shv(X) for a
paracompact space X, and is closely related to both cohomological dimension and Krull dimension. We will
show that any ∞-topos which is (locally) ﬁnite-dimensional is hypercomplete, thereby justifying assertion
(7) of §6.5.4. We will conclude by proving a bound on the homotopy dimension of Shv(X) where X is
a Heyting space (see §7.2.4 for a deﬁnition); this may be regarded as a generalization of Grothendieck’s
vanishing theorem, which applies to non-abelian cohomology and to (certain) non-Noetherian spaces X.

Our third application is a generalization of the proper base change theorem. Suppose given a Cartesian

of locally compact topological spaces. There is a natural transformation

η : p∗q∗ → q′

of functors from the derived category of abelian sheaves on X to the derived category of abelian sheaves on
Y ′. The proper base change theorem asserts that η is an isomorphism whenever q is a proper map. In §7.3,
we will generalize this statement to allow nonabelian coeﬃcient systems. To give the proof, we will develop
a theory of proper morphisms between ∞-topoi, which is of some interest in itself.

7.1 Paracompact Spaces

Let X be a topological space and G an abelian group. There are many diﬀerent deﬁnitions for the cohomology
group Hn(X; G); we will single out three of them for discussion here. First of all, we have the singular
cohomology groups Hn
sing(X; G), which are deﬁned to be cohomology of a chain complex of G-valued singular
cochains on X. An alternative is to regard Hn(•, G) as a representable functor on the homotopy category
of topological spaces, so that Hn
rep(X; G) can be identiﬁed with the set of homotopy classes of maps from X
into an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(G, n). A third possibility is to use the sheaf cohomology Hn
sheaf(X; G)
of X with coeﬃcients in the constant sheaf G on X.

If X is a suﬃciently nice space (for example, a CW complex), then these three deﬁnitions give the same
result. In general, however, all three give diﬀerent answers. The singular cohomology of X is deﬁned using
continuous maps from ∆k into X, and is useful only when there is a good supply of such maps. Similarly, the
cohomology group Hn
rep(X; G) is deﬁned using continuous maps from X to a simplicial complex, and is useful
only when there is a good supply of real-valued functions on X. However, the sheaf cohomology of X seems
to be a good invariant for arbitrary spaces: it has excellent formal properties and gives sensible answers in
situations where the other deﬁnitions break down (such as the ´etale topology of algebraic varieties).

We will take the position that the sheaf cohomology of a space X is the correct answer in all cases. It
is then natural to ask for conditions under which the other deﬁnitions of cohomology give the same answer.
We should expect this to be true for singular cohomology when there are many continuous functions into X,
and for Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology when there are many continuous functions out of X. It seems that
the latter class of spaces is much larger than the former: it includes, for example, all paracompact spaces,
and consequently for paracompact spaces one can show that the sheaf cohomology Hn
sheaf(X; G) coincides
with the Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology Hn
rep(X; G). Our goal in this section is to prove a generalization of
the preceding statement to the setting of nonabelian cohomology (Theorem 7.1.0.1 below; see also Theorem
7.1.4.3 for the case where the coeﬃcient system G it not assumed to be constant).

As we saw in §6.5.4, we can associate to every topological space X an ∞-topos Shv(X) of sheaves (of
spaces) on X. Moreover, given a continuous map p : X → Y of topological spaces, p−1 induces a map from
the category of open subsets of Y to the category of open subsets of X. Composition with p−1 induces a
geometric morphism p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ).

Fix now a topological space X and let p : X → ∗ denote the projection from X to a point. Let K be a
Kan complex, which we may identify with an object of S ≃ Shv(∗). Then p∗K ∈ Shv(X) may be regarded
as the constant sheaf on X having value K, and p∗p∗K ∈ S as the space of global sections of p∗K. Let
|K| denote the geometric realization of K (a topological space), and let [X, |K|] denote the set of homotopy
classes of maps from X into |K|. The main goal of this section is to prove the following:

Theorem 7.1.0.1. If X is paracompact, then there is a canonical bijection

φ : [X, |K|] → π0(p∗p∗K).

Remark 7.1.0.2. In fact, the map φ exists without the assumption that X is paracompact: the construc-
tion in general can be formally reduced to the paracompact case, since the universal example X = |K| is
paracompact. However, in the case where X is not paracompact, the map φ is not necessarily bijective.

Our ﬁrst step in proving Theorem 7.1.0.1 is to realize the space of maps from X into |K| as a mapping
space in an appropriate simplicial category of spaces over X. In §7.1.2, we deﬁne this category and endow
it with a (simplicial) model structure. We may therefore extract an underlying ∞-category N(Top◦

Our next goal is to construct an equivalence between N(Top◦

/X ) and the ∞-topos Shv(X) of sheaves of
spaces on X (a very similar comparison result has been obtained by To¨en; see [77]). To prove this, we will
attempt to realize N(Top◦
/X ) as a localization of a certain ∞-category of presheaves. We will give an explicit
description of the relevant localization in §7.1.3, and show that it is equivalent to N(Top◦
/X ) in §7.1.4. In
§7.1.5, we will deduce Theorem 7.1.0.1 as a corollary of this more general comparison result. We conclude
with §7.1.6, in which we apply our results to obtain a reformulation of classical shape theory in the language
of ∞-topoi.

7.1.1 Some Point-Set Topology

Let X be a paracompact topological space. In order to prove Theorem 7.1.0.1, we will need to understand
the homotopy theory of presheaves on X. We then encounter the following technical obstacle: an open
subset of a paracompact space need not be paracompact. Because we wish to deal only with paracompact
spaces, it will be convenient to restrict our attention to presheaves which are deﬁned only with respect to
a particular basis B for X consisting of paracompact open sets. The existence of a well-behaved basis is
guaranteed by the following result:

Proposition 7.1.1.1. Let X be a paracompact topological space and U an open subset of X. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(i) There exists a continuous function f : X → [0, 1] such that U = {x ∈ X : f (x) > 0}.

(ii) There exists a sequence of closed subsets {Kn ⊆ X}n≥0 such that each Kn+1 contains an open neigh-

borhood of Kn, and U =

n≥0 Kn.

(iii) There exists a sequence of closed subsets {Kn ⊆ X}n≥0 such that U =

S

n≥0 Kn.

Let B denote the collection of all open subsets of X which satisfy these conditions. Then:

S

(1) The elements of B form a basis for the topology of X.

(2) Each element of B is paracompact.

(3) The collection B is stable under ﬁnite intersections (in particular, X ∈ B).

(4) The empty set ∅ belongs to B.

Remark 7.1.1.2. A subset of X which can be written as a countable union of closed subsets of X is called
an Fσ-subset of X. Consequently, the basis B for the topology of X appearing in Proposition 7.1.1.1 can be
characterized as the collection of open Fσ-subsets of X.

Remark 7.1.1.3. If the topological space X admits a metric d, then every open subset U ⊆ X belongs to
the basis B of Proposition 7.1.1.1. Indeed, we may assume without loss of generality that the diameter of
X is at most 1 (adjusting the metric if necessary), in which case the function

satisﬁes condition (i).

f (x) = d(x, X − U ) = inf
y /∈U

d(x, y)

Proof. We ﬁrst show that (i) and (ii) are equivalent. If (i) is satisﬁed, then the closed subsets Kn = {x ∈
X : f (x) ≥ 1
n } satisfy the demands of (ii). Suppose next that (ii) is satisﬁed. For each n ≥ 0, let Gn
denote the closure of X − Kn+1, so that Gn ∩ Kn = ∅. It follows that there exists a continuous function
fn : X → [0, 1] such that that fn vanishes on Gn and the restriction of f to Kn is the constant function
taking the value 1. Then the function f =

fn
2n has the property required by (i).

0 = K0. Assuming that K ′

We now prove that (ii) ⇔ (iii). The implication (ii) ⇒ (iii) is obvious. For the converse, suppose that
n Kn, where the Kn are closed subsets of X. We deﬁne a new sequence of closed subsets {K ′
n}n≥0
U =
by induction as follows. Let K ′
n has already been deﬁned, let V and W be
disjoint open neighborhoods of the closed sets K ′
n ∪ Kn+1 and X − U , respectively (the existence of such
neighborhoods follows from the assumption that X is paracompact; in fact, it would suﬃce to assume that
X is normal), and deﬁne K ′
n+1 to be the closure of V . It is then easy to see that the sequence of closed sets
{K ′

n}n≥0 satisﬁes the requirements of (ii).
We now verify properties (1) through (4) of the collection of open sets B. Assertions (3) and (4) are
obvious. To prove (1), consider an arbitrary point x ∈ X and an open set U containing x. Then the closed

n>0

P

S

546

sets {x} and X − U are disjoint, so there exists a continuous function f : X → [0, 1] supported on U such
that f (x) = 1. Then U ′ = {y ∈ X : f (y) > 0 is an open neighborhood of x contained in U , and U ′ ∈ B.

It remains to prove (2). Let U ∈ B; we wish to prove that U is paracompact. Write U =

n≥0 Kn,
where each Kn is a closed subset of X containing a neighborhood of Kn−1 (by convention, we set Kn = ∅ for
n < 0). Let {Uα} be an open covering of X. Since each Kn is paracompact, we can choose a locally ﬁnite
covering {Vα,n} of Kn which reﬁnes {Uα ∩ Kn}. Let V 0
α,n denote the intersection of Vα,n with the interior
of Kn, and let Wα,n = V 0
α,n ∩ (X − Kn−2). Then {Wα,n} is a locally ﬁnite open covering of X which reﬁnes
{Uα}.

S

Let X be a paracompact topological space, and let B be the basis constructed in Proposition 7.1.1.1.
Then B can be viewed as a category with ﬁnite limits, and is equipped with a natural Grothendieck topology.
To simplify the notation, we will let Shv(B) denote the ∞-topos Shv(N(B)). Note that because N(B) is the
nerve of a partially ordered set, the ∞-topos Shv(B) is 0-localic. Moreover, the corresponding locale Sub(1)
of subobjects of the ﬁnal object 1 ∈ Shv(B) is isomorphic to the lattice of open subsets of X. It follows that
the restriction map Shv(X) → Shv(B) is an equivalence of ∞-topoi.
Warning 7.1.1.4. Let X be a topological space and B a basis of X, regarded as a partially ordered set
with respect to inclusions. Then B inherits a Grothendieck topology, and we can deﬁne Shv(B) as above.
However, the induced map Shv(X) → Shv(B) is generally not an equivalence of ∞-categories: this requires
the assumption that B is stable under ﬁnite intersections. In other words, a sheaf (of spaces) on X generally
cannot be recovered by knowing its sections on a basis for the topology of X; see Counterexample 6.5.4.9.

7.1.2 Spaces over X
Let X be a topological space with a speciﬁed basis B, ﬁxed throughout this section. We wish to study the
homotopy theory of spaces over X; that is, spaces Y equipped with a map p : Y → X. We should emphasize
that we do not wish to assume that the map p is a ﬁbration, or that p is equivalent to a ﬁbration in any
reasonable sense: we are imagining that p encodes a sheaf of spaces on X, and we do not wish to impose
any condition of local triviality on this sheaf.

Let Top denote the category of topological spaces, and Top/X the category of topological spaces mapping
to X. For each p : Y → X and every open subset U ⊆ X, we deﬁne a simplicial set SingX (Y, U ) by the
formula

SingX (Y, U )n = HomX (U × |∆n|, Y ).
Face and degeneracy maps are deﬁned in the obvious way. We note the simplicial set SingX (Y, U ) is always
a Kan complex. We will simply write SingX (Y ) to denote the simplicial presheaf on X given by

U 7→ SingX (Y, U ).
Proposition 7.1.2.1. There exists a model structure on the category Top/X , uniquely determined by the
following properties:

(W ) A morphism

is a ﬁbration if and only if, for every U ⊆ X belonging to B, the induced map SingX (Z, U )• →
SingX (Y, U )• is a Kan ﬁbration.

Remark 7.1.2.2. The model structure on Top/X described in Proposition 7.1.2.1 depends on the chosen
basis B for X, and not only on the topological space X itself.

Proof of Proposition 7.1.2.1. The proof uses the theory of coﬁbrantly generated model categories; we give a
sketch and refer the reader to [38] for more details. We will say that a morphism Y → Z in Top/X is a
coﬁbration if it has the left lifting property with respect to every trivial ﬁbration in Top/X .

We begin by observing that a map Y → Z in Top/X is a ﬁbration if and only if it has the right lifting
i ⊆ U × ∆n, where 0 ≤ i ≤ n and U is in B. Let I denote
property with respect to every inclusion U × Λn
the weakly saturated class of morphisms in Top/X generated by these inclusions. Using the small object
argument, one can show that every morphism Y → Z in Top/X admits a factorization

→ Y ′ g
f

→ Z

Y

where f belongs to I and g is a ﬁbration. (Although the objects in Top/X are not generally small, one can
still apply the small object argument since they are small relative to the class I of morphisms: see [38]).

Similarly, a map Y → Z is a trivial ﬁbration if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to
every inclusion U × | ∂ ∆n| ⊆ U × |∆n|, where U ∈ B. Let J denote the weakly saturated class of morphisms
generated by these inclusions: then every morphism Y → Z admits a factorization

→ Y ′ g
f

→ Z

Y

where f belongs to J and g is a trivial ﬁbration.

The only nontrivial point to verify is that every morphism which belongs to I is a trivial coﬁbration; once
this is established, the axioms for a model category follow formally. Since it is clear that I is contained in J,
and that J consists of coﬁbrations, it suﬃces to show that every morphism in I is a weak equivalence. To prove
this, let us consider the class K of all closed immersions k : Y → Z in Top/X such that there exist functions
λ : Z → [0, ∞) and h : Z × [0, ∞) → Z such that k(Y ) = λ−1{0}, h(z, 0) = z, and h(z, λ(z)) ∈ k(Y ). Now
we make the following observations:

(1) Every inclusion U × |Λn

i | ⊆ U × |∆n| belongs to K.

(2) The class K is weakly saturated; consequently, I ⊆ K.

(3) Every morphism k : Y → Z which belongs to K is a homotopy equivalence in Top/X , and is therefore

a weak equivalence.

The category Top/X is naturally tensored over simplicial sets, if we deﬁne Y ⊗ ∆n = Y × |∆n| for
Y ∈ Top/X . This induces a simplicial structure on Top/X , which is obviously compatible with the model
structure of Proposition 7.1.2.1.

We note that SingX is a (simplicial) functor from Top/X to the category of simplicial presheaves on B
(here we regard B as a category whose morphisms are given by inclusions of open subsets of X). We regard
SetBop
∆ as a simplicial model category, via the projective model structure described in §A.3.3. By construction,
SingX preserves ﬁbrations and trivial ﬁbrations. Moreover, the functor SingX has a left adjoint

F 7→ |F |X ;

we will refer to this left adjoint as geometric realization (in the case where X is a point, it coincides with the
usual geometric realization functor from Set∆ to the category of topological spaces). The functor |F |X is
determined by the property that |FU |X ≃ U if FU denotes the presheaf (of sets) represented by U , and the
requirement that geometric realization commutes with colimits and with tensor products by simplicial sets.

We may summarize the situation as follows:

548

Proposition 7.1.2.3. The adjoint functors (||X , SingX ) determine a (simplicial) Quillen adjunction between
Top/X (with the model structure of Proposition 7.1.2.1 ) and SetBop
∆ (with the projective model structure).

7.1.3 The Sheaf Condition

Let X be a topological space and B a basis for the topology of X which is stable under ﬁnite intersections.
Let A denote the category of SetBop
∆ of simplicial presheaves on B; we regard A as a model category with
respect to the projective model structure deﬁned in §A.3.3. According to Proposition 5.1.1.1, the ∞-category
N(A◦) associated to A is equivalent to the ∞-category P(B) = P(N(B)) of presheaves on B. In particular,
the homotopy category hP(N(B)) is equivalent to the homotopy category hA ( the category obtained from A
by formally inverting all weak equivalences of simplicial presheaves). The ∞-category Shv(B) is a reﬂective
subcategory of P(N(B)). Consequently, we may identify the homotopy category hShv(B) with a reﬂective
subcategory of hA. We will say that a simplicial presheaf F : Bop → Set∆ is a sheaf if it belongs to this
reﬂective subcategory. The purpose of this section is to obtain an explicit criterion which will allow us to
test whether or not a given simplicial presheaf F : Bop → Set∆ is a sheaf.

Warning 7.1.3.1. The condition that a simplicial presheaf F : Bop → Set∆ be a sheaf, in the sense deﬁned
above, is generally unrelated to the condition that F be a simplicial object in the category of sheaves of sets
on X (though these two notions do agree in the special case where the simplicial presheaf F takes values in
constant simplicial sets).

Let j : N(B) → P(B) be the Yoneda embedding. By deﬁnition, an object F ∈ P(B) belongs to Shv(B) if
and only if, for every U ∈ B and every monomorphism i : U 0 → j(U ) which corresponds to a covering sieve
U on U , the induced map

MapP(B)(j(U ), F ) → MapP(B)(U 0, F )
is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H. In order to make this condition explicit in terms of simplicial
presheaves, we note that i : U 0 → j(U ) can be identiﬁed with the inclusion χU ⊆ χU of simplicial presheaves,
where

χU (V ) =

χU(V ) =

∗ if V ⊆ U
∅ otherwise.

(

∗
∅

(

if V ∈ U
otherwise.

However, we encounter a technical issue: in order to extract the correct space of maps MapP(B)(U 0, F ), we
need to select a projectively coﬁbrant model for U 0 in A. In general, the simplicial presheaf χU deﬁned above
is not projectively coﬁbrant. To address this problem, we will construct a new simplicial presheaf, equivalent
to χU, which has better mapping properties.

Deﬁnition 7.1.3.2. Let U be a linearly ordered set equipped with a map s : U → B. We deﬁne a simplicial
presheaf NU : Bop → Set∆ as follows: for each V ∈ B, let NU(V ) be the nerve of the linearly ordered set
{U ∈ U : V ⊆ s(U )}. NU may be viewed as a subobject of the constant presheaf ∆U taking the value
N(U) = ∆U.

Remark 7.1.3.3. The above notation is slightly abusive, in that NU depends not only on U, but on the
map s and on the linear ordering of U. If the map s is injective (as it will be in most applications), we will
frequently simply identify U with its image in B. In practice, U will usually be a covering sieve on some
object U ∈ B.

Remark 7.1.3.4. The linear ordering of U is unrelated to the partial ordering of B by inclusion. We will
write the former as ≤ and the latter as ⊆.

Example 7.1.3.5. Let U = ∅. Then NU = ∅.

Example 7.1.3.6. Let U = {U } for some U ∈ B, and let s : U → B be the inclusion. Then NU ≃ χU .

Proposition 7.1.3.7. Let

s′

be a commutative diagram, where p is an order-preserving injection between linearly ordered sets. Then the
induced map NU → NU′ is a projective coﬁbration of simplicial presheaves.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may identify U with a linearly ordered subset of U′ via p. Choose a
transﬁnite sequence of simplicial subsets of N U′

K0 ⊆ K1 ⊆ . . .

where K0 = N U, Kλ =
a single nondegenerate simplex (if such a simplex exists). For each ordinal α, let Fα ⊆ NU′ be deﬁned by

α<λ Kα if λ is a nonzero limit ordinal, and Kα+1 is obtained from Kα by adjoining

S

Fα(V ) = NU′ (V ) ∩ Kα ⊆ N(U′).

Then F0 = NU, Fλ = lim
Fα when α is a nonzero limit ordinal, and Fα ≃ NU′ for α ≫ 0. It therefore
suﬃces to show that each map Fα → Fα+1 is a projective coﬁbration.
If Kα = Kα+1, this is clear;
otherwise, we may suppose that Kα+1 is obtained from Kα by adjoining a single nondegenerate simplex
{U0 < U1 < . . . Un} of N(U′). Let U = s′(U0) ∩ . . . ∩ s′(Un) ∈ B.

−→α<λ

Then there is a coCartesian square

The desired result now follows, since the upper horizontal arrow is clearly a projective coﬁbration.

Corollary 7.1.3.8. Let U be a linearly ordered set and s : U → B a map. Then the simplicial presheaf
NU ∈ SetBop

∆ is projectively coﬁbrant.

Note that NU(V ) is contractible if V ⊆ s(U ) for some U ∈ U, and empty otherwise. Consequently, we

deduce:

Corollary 7.1.3.9. Let U ⊆ B be a sieve, equipped with a linear ordering. The unique map NU → χU is a
weak equivalence of simplicial presheaves.

Notation 7.1.3.10. Let U be a linearly ordered set equipped with a map s : U → B. For any simplicial
presheaf F : Bop → Set∆, we let F (U) denote the simplicial set MapA(NU, F ).

Remark 7.1.3.11. Let U ∈ B, U = {U } and s : U → B is the inclusion. Then F (U) = F (U ). In general,
we can think of F (U) as a homotopy limit of F (V ) taken over V in the sieve generated by s : U → B. To
give a vertex of F (U), we must give for each U ∈ U a point of F (sU ); for every pair of objects U, V ∈ U a
path between the corresponding points in F (sU ∩ sV ), and so forth.

Corollary 7.1.3.12. Let F : Bop → Kan be a (projectively ﬁbrant) simplicial presheaf on B. Then F is a
sheaf if and only if, for every U ∈ B and every sieve U that covers U , there exists a linearly ordered set U0
equipped with a map U0 → U, which generates U as a sieve, such that the induced map F (U ) → F (U0) is a
weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

Lemma 7.1.3.13. Suppose that U ⊆ X is paracompact, and let U ⊆ B be a covering of U . Choose a linear
ordering of U. Then the natural map π : |NU|X → U is a homotopy equivalence in Top/X . (In other words,
there exists a section s : U → NU of π, such that s ◦ π is ﬁberwise homotopic to the identity.)

Proof. Any partition of unity subordinate to the open cover U gives rise to a section of π. To check that
s ◦ π is ﬁberwise homotopic to the identity, use a “straight line” homotopy.

Proposition 7.1.3.14. Let X be a topological space, B a basis for the topology of X. Assume that B is
stable under ﬁnite intersections and that each element of B is paracompact. For every continuous map of
topological spaces p : Y → X, the simplicial presheaf SingX (Y ) of sections of p is sheaf.

Proof. Let F = SingX (Y ). We note that F is a projectively ﬁbrant simplicial presheaf on B. By Corollary
7.1.3.12, it suﬃces to show that for every U ∈ B, every covering U of U , and every linear ordering on U, the
natural map F (U ) → F (U) is a homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets. In other words, it suﬃces to show
that composition with the projection π : NU → U induces a homotopy equivalence

of simplicial sets. This follows immediately from Lemma 7.1.3.13.

Map/X (U, Y ) → Map/X (|NU|X , Y )

Remark 7.1.3.15. Under the hypotheses of Proposition 7.1.3.14, the object of Shv(X) corresponding to
the simplicial presheaf SingX (Y ) is not necessarily hypercomplete.

7.1.4 The Main Result

Suppose that X is a paracompact topological space and B is the basis for the topology of X described in
Proposition 7.1.1.1. Our main goal is to show that the composition of the adjoint functors

F 7→ SingX |F |X

may be identiﬁed with a “sheaﬁﬁcation” of F , at least in the case where F is a projectively coﬁbrant simplicial
presheaf on B.

In proving this, we have some ﬂexibility regarding the choice of F : it will suﬃce to treat the question after
replacing F by a weakly equivalent simplicial presheaf F ′, provided that F ′ is also projectively coﬁbrant.
Our ﬁrst step is to make a particularly convenient choice for F ′.

Lemma 7.1.4.1. Let B be a partially ordered set (via ⊆) with a least element ∅, and F : Bop → Set∆ be an
arbitrary simplicial presheaf such that F (∅) is weakly contractible.

There exists a (linearly ordered) set V and a simplicial presheaf F ′ : Bop → Set∆ with the following

properties:

(1) There exists a monomorphism F ′ → ∆V from F ′ to the (constant) simplicial presheaf ∆V on B taking

the value ∆V . (Recall that ∆V denotes the nerve of the linearly ordered set V .)

(2) For every ﬁnite subset V0 ⊆ V , there exists U ∈ B such that U ′ ⊆ U if and only if ∆V0 ⊆ F ′(U ′) ⊆ ∆V .

(3) As a simplicial presheaf on B, F ′ is projectively coﬁbrant.

(4) In the homotopy category of SetBop

∆ , F ′ and F are equivalent to one another.

551

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that F is (weakly) ﬁbrant. We now build a “cellular
model” of F . More precisely, we construct the following data:

(A) A transﬁnite sequence of simplicial sets

where Yα is deﬁned for all ordinals < α0.

Y0 → Y1 → . . . ,

(B) For each α < α0, a subsheaf Fα of the constant presheaf on B taking the value Yα.

(C) A compatible family of maps Fα → F , so that we may regard {Fα} as a functor from the linearly

ordered set {α : α < α0} to (Set∆)Bop
/F .

(D) For each α < α0, there exists U ∈ B, n ≥ 0, and compatible pushout diagrams

The construction of this data is reasonably standard, and left to the reader. Let Y = lim

Yβ. Let Y ′′
be the second barycentric subdivision of Y , so that Y ′′ may be identiﬁed with a simplicial complex (that is,
a simplicial subset of ∆V for some linearly ordered set V . For each α, let F ′′
α denote the result of applying
the second barycentric subdivision functor to Fα termwise. Let F ′′ = lim
β . Finally, we deﬁne F ′ by
F ′′
the coCartesian square

−→β<α0

−→β<α0

F ′′(∅) × χ∅

/ F ′.

The simplicial presheaf F ′ satisﬁes (1) by construction. Properties (2) and (3) are reasonably clear (in
fact, (3) is a formal consequence of (2)). Condition (4) holds for the simplicial presheaf F ′′ as a consequence
of (E), and the fact that there is a canonical weak homotopy equivalence K ′′ → K, for any simplicial set K
(see Variant 4.2.3.15). Moreover, the assumption that F (∅) is weakly contractible ensures that (4) remains
valid for the pushout F ′.

Before we can state the next lemma, let us introduce a bit of notation. Let F : Bop → Set∆ be a simplicial
presheaf. Then we let |F | denote the presheaf of topological spaces on B obtained by composing F with
the geometric realization functor; similarly, if G is a presheaf of topological spaces on B, then we let Sing G
denote the presheaf of simplicial sets obtained by composing G with the functor Sing. We note that there is
a natural transformation

Sing |F | → SingX |F |X .

Lemma 7.1.4.2. Let X be a topological space, B the collection of open Fσ subsets of X (see Proposition
7.1.1.1). Let F : Bop → Set∆ be a projectively coﬁbrant simplicial presheaf, which is a sheaf (that is, a
ﬁbrant model for F satisﬁes the criterion of Corollary 7.1.3.12). Then the unit map F → SingX |F |X is an
equivalence.

Proof. We note that the functor F 7→ Sing |F | preserves weak equivalences in F , and the functor F 7→
SingX |F |X preserves weak equivalences between projectively coﬁbrant presheaves F . Consequently, by
Lemma 7.1.4.1, we may suppose without loss of generality that there is a linearly ordered set V and that F
is a subsheaf of the constant simplicial presheaf taking the value ∆V , such that F (∅) = ∆V .

It will be suﬃcient to prove that

Sing |F | → SingX |F |X

is an equivalence:
in other words, we wish to show that (Sing |F |)(U ) → (SingX |F |X )(U ) is a homotopy
equivalence of Kan complexes, for every U ∈ B. Replacing X by U , we can reduce to the problem of showing
that

p : (Sing |F |)(X) → (SingX |F |X )(X)
is a homotopy equivalence. It now suﬃces to show that for every inclusion K ′ ⊆ K of ﬁnite simplicial sets
(that is, simplicial sets with only ﬁnitely many nondegenerate simplices), a commutative diagram

K ′ × {0}

/ (Sing |F |)(X)

K × {0}

g

/ (SingX |F |X )(X)

can be expanded to a commutative diagram

(K ′ × ∆1)

K ′×{1}(K × {1})

/ (Sing |F |)(X)

`

K × ∆1

/ (SingX |F |X )(X).

(In fact, it suﬃces to treat the case where K ′ ⊆ K is the inclusion ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n; however, this will result in
no simpliﬁcation in the following arguments.)

Now let B = {Uα}α∈A, where A is a linearly ordered set. Since F is assumed to be a sheaf on B, the
equivalent presheaf Sing |F | is also a sheaf. Consequently, for any covering U ⊆ B (and any linear ordering
of U), the natural map (Sing |F |)(X) → (Sing |F |)(U) is an equivalence. Likewise, by Proposition 7.1.3.14,
the map (SingX |F |X )(X) → (SingX |F |X )(U) is an equivalence. Consequently, it suﬃces to ﬁnd a covering
U ⊆ B of X and a diagram

(K ′ × ∆1)

K ′×{1}(K × {1})

/ (Sing |F |)(U)

`

K × ∆1

G

/ (SingX |F |X )(U)

which extends g.

Since K is ﬁnite, the map g : K → (SingX |F |X )(X) may be identiﬁed with a continuous, ﬁber-preserving
map X ×|K| → |F |X , which we will also denote by g. By assumption, F is a subsheaf of the constant presheaf
taking the value ∆V ; constantly, we may identify |F |X with a subspace of ∆V
X = X ⊗ ∆V . (We may identify
X with the product X × |∆V | as a set, though it generally has a ﬁner topology.) We may represent a point
∆V
of ∆V
X by an ordered pair (x, q), where x ∈ X and q : V → [0, 1] has the property that {v ∈ V : q(v) 6= 0} is

X,v denote the open subset of ∆V

v∈V q(v) = 1. For each v ∈ V , we let ∆V

X,v}v∈V form an open cover of cover ∆V

X consisting of all pairs
ﬁnite and
(x, g) such that q(v) > 0; note that the sets {∆V
X . Consequently,
P
the open sets {g−1∆V
X,v}v∈V form an open cover of X × |K|. Let x be a point of X. The compactness of
|K| implies that there is a ﬁnite subset V0 ⊆ V , an open neighborhood Ux of X containing x, and an open
covering {Wx,v : v ∈ V0} of |K|, such that g(Ux × Wx,v) ⊆ ∆V
X,v. Choose a partition of unity subordinate
to the covering {Wx,v}, thereby determining a map fx : |K| → |∆V0 |. The open sets {Ux} cover X; since X
is paracompact, this covering has a locally ﬁnite reﬁnement. Shrinking the Ux if necessary, we may suppose
that this reﬁnement is given by {Ux}x∈X0, and that each Ux belongs to B. Let U = {Ux}x∈X0, and choose
a linear ordering of U.

We now deﬁne a new map g′ : K → (Sing |F |)(U). To do so, we must give, for every ﬁnite U0 = {Ux0 <

. . . < Uxn} ⊆ U, a map

A0 : |∆{x0,...,xn}| × |K| → |F (Ux0 ∩ . . . ∩ Uxn)| ⊆ |∆V |,
g′

which are required to satisfy some obvious compatibilities. Deﬁne g′

U0 by the formula

g′
U0(

λixi, z) =

λifxi(z).

U0

It is clear that g′
is well-deﬁned as a map from |∆{x0,...,xn}| × |K| to |∆V |. We claim that, in fact, this map
factors through |F (Ux0 ∩ . . . U§\ )|. Let z ∈ |K|, and consider the set V ′ = {v ∈ V : (∃0 ≤ i ≤ n)[fxi(z)(v) 6=
0]} ⊆ V . Condition (2) of Lemma 7.1.4.1 ensures that there exists U ∈ B such that ∆V ′
⊆ F (U ′) if and
only if U ′ ⊆ U . We note that, for each y ∈ Ux0 ∩ . . . ∩ Uxn, we have g(y, z)(v) 6= 0 for v ∈ V ′; it follows that
y ∈ U . Consequently, we deduce that Uα0 ∩ . . . ∩ Uαn ⊆ U , so that ∆V ′
⊆ F (Ux0 ∩ . . . ∩ Uxn). It follows
|{z} × |∆U0| factors through |F (Ux0 ∩ . . . ∩ Uxn)|. Since this holds for every z ∈ |K|, it follows
that g′
U0
that g′
A0 is well-deﬁned; evidently these maps are compatible with one another and give the desired map
g′ : K → (Sing |F |)(U).

We now observe that the composite maps

K

g′
→ (Sing |F |)(U) → (SingX |F |X )(U)

g
→ (SingX |F |X )(X) → (SingX |F |X )(U)
are homotopic via a “straight-line” homotopy G : K × ∆1 → (SingX |F |X )(U), which has the desired
properties.

K

Now, the hard work is done and we are ready to enjoy the fruits of our labors.

Theorem 7.1.4.3. Let X be a paracompact topological space and B the collection of open Fσ subsets of X
(see Proposition 7.1.1.1). Then, for any projectively coﬁbrant F : Bop → Set∆, the natural map

exhibits SingX |F |X as a sheaﬁﬁcation of F .

F → SingX |F |X

Proof. Let hTop/X be the homotopy category of the model category Top/X (the category obtained by
inverting all of the weak equivalences deﬁned in Proposition 7.1.2.1) and hSetBop
∆ the homotopy category
of the category of simplicial presheaves on B. It follows from Proposition 7.1.2.3 that the adjoint functors

We ﬁrst claim that for any Y ∈ Top/X , the counit map | SingX Y |L

X → Y is a weak equivalence. To see
this, choose a projectively coﬁbrant model F → SingX Y for SingX Y ; we wish to show that the induced map
|F |X → Y is a weak equivalence. By deﬁnition, this is equivalent to the assertion that SingX |F |X → SingX Y
is a weak equivalence. But we have a commutative triangle

where left-diagonal map is a weak equivalence by Lemma 7.1.4.2 and Proposition 7.1.3.14, and the top
horizontal map is a weak equivalence by construction; the desired result now follows from the two-out-of-
three property.

It follows that we may identify hTop/X with a full subcategory C ⊆ hSetBop

∆ . By Proposition 7.1.3.14, the
objects of this subcategory are sheaves on B; by Lemma 7.1.4.2, every sheaf on B is equivalent to SingX Y
for an appropriately chosen Y ; thus C consists of precisely the sheaves on B.

The composite functor F 7→ SingX |F |L

∆ to the
subcategory C. In particular, when F is projectively coﬁbrant, the unit of the adjunction F → SingX |F |X
is a localization of F .

X may be identiﬁed with a localization functor from hSetBop

Corollary 7.1.4.4. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 7.1.4.3, the functor SingX induces an equivalence of
∞-categories

N(Top◦

/X ) → Shv(X).

In particular, the ∞-category N(Top◦

/X ) is an ∞-topos.

Remark 7.1.4.5. In the language of model categories, we may interpret Corollary 7.1.4.4 as asserting that
SingX , ||X furnish a Quillen equivalence between Top/X (with the model structure of Proposition 7.1.2.1)
and SetBop

∆ where the latter is equipped with the following localization of the projective model structure:

(1) A map F → F ′ in SetBop

∆ is a coﬁbration if it is a projective coﬁbration (in the sense of Deﬁnition

A.3.3.1).

(2) A map F → F ′ in SetBop

∆ is a weak equivalence if it induces an equivalence in the ∞-category Shv(X).

7.1.5 Base Change

With Corollary 7.1.4.4 in hand, we are almost ready to deduce Theorem 7.1.0.1. Suppose given a paracompact
space X, and let B denote the collection of all open Fσ subsets of X. Let p : Shv(X) → Shv(∗) ≃ S be the
geometric morphism induced by the projection X → ∗.

For any simplicial set K, let FK denote the constant simplicial presheaf on B taking the value K. Then,
∆ with the localized model structure of Remark 7.1.4.5, then FK is a model for the sheaf

if we endow SetBop
p∗K. Consequently, the space p∗p∗K may be identiﬁed up to homotopy with the mapping space

which, in virtue of Corollary 7.1.4.4, is equivalent to

MapShv(X)(F∗, FK)

MapTop/X

(X, X ⊗ K) = (SingX (X ⊗ K))(X)

However, at this point, a technical wrinkle appears: X ⊗ K agrees with X × |K| as a set, but it is equipped
with a ﬁner topology (given by the direct limit of the product topologies X × |K0|, where K0 ⊆ K is a ﬁnite
simplicial subset). In general, we have only an inclusion of simplicial presheaves

η : SingX (X ⊗ K) ⊆ SingX (X × |K|),

555

/
/
$
x
which need not be an isomorphism. However, we will complete the proof of Theorem 7.1.0.1 by showing that
η is an equivalence of simplicial presheaves.

We consider a slightly more general situation. Let p : X → Y be a continuous map between paracompact
spaces, and let BX and BY the collections of open Fσ subsets in X and Y , respectively. Note that the
inverse image along p determines a map q : BY → BX . Composition with q induces a “pushforward” functor
Bop
∆ , which has a left adjoint which we will denote by q∗. Similarly, there is a “pullback”
q∗ : Set
Y
functor p∗ : Top/Y → Top/X ; however, p∗ generally does not possess a right adjoint. Consider the square

This square is “lax commutative”, in the sense that there exists a natural transformation of functors

ηF : |q∗F |X → p∗|F |Y = |F |Y ×Y X.

The map ηF is always a bijection of topological spaces, but is generally not a homeomorphism. Nevertheless,
we have the following:

Proposition 7.1.5.1. Under the hypotheses above, if F : Bop
presheaf on Y , then the map ηF : |q∗F |X → |F |Y ×Y X is a weak equivalence in Top/X .

Y → Set∆ is a projectively coﬁbrant simplicial

The proof is based on the following lemma:

Lemma 7.1.5.2. Let Y be a paracompact topological space and let B be the collection of open Fσ subsets of
Y (see Proposition 7.1.1.1). Let V be a linearly ordered set. Suppose that for every nonempty ﬁnite subset
V0 ⊆ V , we are given an basic open set U (V0) ∈ B satisfying the following conditions:

(a) If V0 ⊆ V1, then U (V1) ⊆ U (V0).

(b) The open set U (∅) concides with X.

Let F : Bop → Set∆ be the simplicial presheaf which assigns to each U ∈ B the simplicial subset F (U ) ⊆ ∆V
spanned by those nondegenerate simplices σ corresponding to ﬁnite subsets V0 ⊆ V such that U ⊆ U (V0) (see
Lemma 7.1.4.1).

For every object X ∈ Top/Y , an n-simplex τ of MapTop/Y

(Y, |F |Y ) determines a map of topological spaces
from X × |∆n| to |∆V |, which in turn determines a collection of maps φv : X × |∆n| → [0, 1] such that for
every x ∈ X × |∆n|, the sum Σv∈V φv(x) is equal to 1. Let Map0
(X, |F |Y ) denote the simplicial subset
of MapTop/Y

(X, |F |Y ) spanned by those simplices τ which satisfy the following condition, where K = ∆n:

Top/Y

(∗) There exists a locally ﬁnite collection of open sets {Uv ⊆ X × |K|}v∈V such that each Uv contains the
Uv is contained in the inverse image of U (V0) for

closure of the support of the function φv, and
every ﬁnite subset V0 ⊆ V .

If the topological space X is paracompact, then the inclusion i : Map0

Proof. Note that for any ﬁnite simplicial set K, we can identify HomSet∆ (K, Map0
(X, |F |Y ) with the
set of all collections of continuous maps {φv : X × |K| → [0, 1]} satisfying the condition (∗). Composition
with a retraction of |∆n| onto a horn |Λn

show that for every inclusion K ′ ⊆ K of ﬁnite simplicial sets, every commutative diagram

Let {Uv}v∈V be a collection of open subsets of X×|K ′| satisfying condition (∗) for the functions {gv|X×|K ′|}.
For each v ∈ V , let Wv = {x ∈ X × |K| : gv(x) 6= 0}. Choose a locally ﬁnite open covering {U ′
v}v∈V of
X × |K| which reﬁnes {Wv}. Let {g′
v}v∈V be a partition of unity such that the closure of the support of

Then the proof of Lemma 7.1.5.2 shows that the inclusions

Map0

Top/Y

(X, |F |Y ) ⊆ Map1

Top/Y

(X, |F |Y ) ⊆ MapTop/Y

(X, |F |Y )

are homotopy equivalences.

Proof of Proposition 7.1.5.1. Suppose given a weak equivalence F → F ′ between projectively coﬁbrant sim-
plicial presheaves F, F ′ : Bop
Y → Set∆. Both q∗ and ||X are left Qullen functors, and therefore preserve weak
equivalences between coﬁbrant objects; it follows that |q∗F |X → |q∗F ′|X is a weak equivalence. Similarly,
|F |Y → |F ′|Y is a weak equivalence between coﬁbrant objects of Top/Y . Since every object of Top/Y is
ﬁbrant, we conclude that |F |Y → |F ′|Y is a homotopy equivalence in Top/Y ; thus |F |Y ×Y X → |F ′|Y ×Y X
is a homotopy equivalence in Top/X . Consequently, we deduce that ηF is a weak equivalence if and only if
ηF ′ is a weak equivalence.

Let F be an arbitrary projectively coﬁbrant simplicial presheaf; we wish to show that ηF is a weak
equivalence. There exists a trivial projective coﬁbration F → F ′, where F ′ is projectively ﬁbrant. It now
is a weak equivalence. Replacing F by F ′, we reduce to the case where F is
suﬃces to show that ηF ′
projectively ﬁbrant.

Let F ′ be a simplicial presheaf on BY satisfying the conditions of Lemma 7.1.4.1. Then F ′ and F are
equivalent in the homotopy category of simplicial presheaves on BY . Since F ′ is projectively coﬁbrant and
F is projectively ﬁbrant, there exists a weak equivalence F ′ → F . We may therefore once again reduce to
proving that ηF ′ is a weak equivalence. Replacing F by F ′, we may suppose that F satisﬁes the conditions
of Lemma 7.1.4.1, for some linearly ordered set V .

For each U ∈ BY , we have a commutative diagram of Kan complexes

lence. This follows from the observation that φ0 is an isomorphism, and the vertical arrows are homotopy
equivalences by Lemma 7.1.5.2.

Theorem 7.1.0.1 now follows immediately from Proposition 7.1.5.1, applied in the case where Y = ∗ and

F is the constant simplicial presheaf BX → Set∆ taking the value K.

Remark 7.1.5.4. There is another solution to the technical diﬃculty presented by the fact that the bijection
X ⊗ K → X × |K| is not necessarily a homeomorphism: one can work in a suitable category of compactly
generated topological spaces, where the base change functor Z 7→ X ×Y Z has a right adjoint and therefore
automatically commutes with all colimits. This is perhaps a more conceptually satisfying approach; however,
it leads to a proof of Theorem 7.1.0.1 only in the special case where the space X is itself compactly generated.

We close this section by describing a few applications of Proposition 7.1.5.1 and its proof to the theory

of sheaves (of spaces) on a paracompact topological space X.

Corollary 7.1.5.5. Let X be a paracompact topological space, Y a closed subset of X, and i : Y → X
the inclusion map. Let F be an object of Shv(X), and let η0 be a global section of i∗ F. Then there exists
an open subset U of X which contains Y and a section η ∈ F(U ) whose image under the restriction map
F(U ) → (i∗ F)(U ∩ Y ) = (i∗ F)(Y ) lies in the path component of η0.
Proof. Let B denote the collection of open Fσ subsets of X. Without loss of generality, we may assume that
F is represented by a projectively coﬁbrant simplicial presheaf F ⊆ ∆V satisfying the conditions of Lemma
7.1.4.1, where V is a linearly ordered set. Using Proposition 7.1.5.1, Corollary 7.1.4.4, and Lemma 7.1.5.2,
it will suﬃce to prove the following assertion:

Corollary 7.1.5.5 admits the following reﬁnement:

Corollary 7.1.5.6. Let X be a paracompact topological space, Y a closed subset of X, and i : Y → X the
inclusion map. Let F be an object of Shv(X). Then the canonical map

αF : lim

is a homotopy equivalence. Here the colimit is taken over the ﬁltered partially ordered set of all open subsets
of X which contain Y .

Proof. We will prove by induction on n ≥ 0 that the map αF is n-connective. The case n = 0 follows from
Corollary 7.1.5.5. Suppose that n > 0. We must show that, for every pair of points η, η′ ∈ lim

some U ⊆ X containing Y . Shrinking U if necessary, we may assume that U is paracompact. Replacing X
by U , we may assume that η and η′ arise from global sections f, f ′ : 1 → F, where 1 denotes the ﬁnal object
of Shv(X). Let G = 1 ×F 1 ∈ Shv(X). Using the left exactness of i∗ and Proposition 5.3.3.3, we can identify
α′
F with αG. We now invoke the inductive hypothesis to deduce that αG is (n − 1)-connective, as desired.

Lemma 7.1.5.7. Let Y be a paracompact topological and B the collection of open Fσ subsets of Y (see
Proposition 7.1.1.1). Let V be a linearly ordered set, and let F : Bop → Set∆ be as in the statement of

For each x ∈ X, there exists a real number ǫx > 0 and an open neighborhood Vx ⊆ X such that

Since the interval [0, 1] is compact, there exists an open neighborhood V ⊆ X containing X ′ such that

Proposition 7.1.5.8. Let X be a paracompact topological space. Suppose given a sequence of closed subspaces

with the following properties:

(1) The union

Xi coincides with X.

X0 ⊆ X1 ⊆ X2 ⊆ . . . ⊆ X

(2) A subset U ⊆ X is open if and only if each of the intersections U ∩ Xi is an open subset of Xi.

S

Then the induced diagram

Shv(X0) → Shv(X1) → . . . → Shv(X)

exhibits Shv(X) as the colimit of the sequence {Shv(Xi)}i≥0 in the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi.

Remark 7.1.5.9. Hypotheses (1) and (2) of Proposition 7.1.5.8 can be summarized by saying that X is the
direct limit of the sequence {Xi} in the category of topological spaces. It follows from this condition that
for any locally compact space Y , the product X × Y is also the direct limit of the sequence {Xi × Y }. To
prove this, we observe that for any topological space Z, we have bijections

Hom(X × Y, Z) ≃ Hom(X, Z Y ) ≃ lim
←−

Hom(Xi, Z Y ) ≃ lim
←−

Hom(Xi × Y, Z),

where Z Y is endowed with the compact-open topology. In particular, we deduce that X × ∆n is the direct
limit of the topological spaces Xi × ∆n, for each n ≥ 0.

we may assume that F is represented by a projectively coﬁbrant simplicial presheaf F : Bop → S satisfying
the conditions of Lemma 7.1.4.1. Using Theorem 7.1.4.3, Corollary 7.1.4.4, and Proposition 7.1.5.1, we can
identify F(X) with the Kan complex of sections K = Map0

We now argue that the counit map v : j∗j∗ → id is an equivalence of functors. Unwinding the deﬁnitions,

the canonical map

equivalence after passing to the global sections over every open Fσ subset U ⊆ Xn. There exists a function
φ0 : Xn → [0, 1] such that U = {x ∈ Xn : φ0(x) > 0}. Choose a map φ : X → [0, 1] such that φ0 = φ|Xn.
Replacing X by the paracompact open subset {x ∈ X : φ(x) > 0}, we can reduce to the case where U = Xn.

We will prove by induction on k that, for any compatible collection of sheaves {Fn ∈ Shv(Xn), Fn ≃

is k-connective, where F = lim
←−
η, η′ ∈ (j(n)∗ F)(Xn), the induced map

j(m)∗ Fm. If k > 0, then it will suﬃce to show that for any pair of points

ψ′ : ∗ ×(j(n)∗ F)(Xn) ∗ → ∗ ×Fn(Xn) ∗

is (k − 1)-connective. Using Corollary 7.1.5.5, we may assume that η and η′ arise from sections η, η′ ∈ F(U ),
for some open neighborhood U of Xn. Shrinking U if necessary, we may assume that U is paracompact.
Replacing X by U , we may assume that η and η′ are global sections of F. Since j(n)∗ is left exact, we can
identify ψ′ with the map

j(n)∗(∗ ×F ∗)(Xn) → (∗ ×Fn ∗)(Xn).

The (k − 1)-connectivity of this map now follows from the inductive hypothesis.

It remains to treat the case k = 0. Fix an element ηn ∈ Fn(Xn); we wish to show that ηn lies in the

image of π0ψ. For every open set U ⊆ X, the map

π0 F(U ) = π0 lim

(j(m)∗ Fm)(U ) → lim

(π0j(m)∗ Fm)(U ) ≃ lim

π0 Fm(U ∩ Xm)

π0 Fm(U ∩ Xm). By virtue of assumption
an open set U containing Xn such that ηn can be lifted to lim
←−
(2), it will suﬃce to construct a sequence of open Fσ subsets {Um ⊆ Xm}m≥n and a sequence of compatible
sections γm ∈ π0 Fm(Um), such that Un = Xn and γm = ηm. The construction goes by induction on m.
Assuming that (Um, ηm) has already been constructed, we invoke the assumption that Um is an Fσ to choose
a continuous function f : Xm → [0, 1] such that Um = {x ∈ Xm : f (x) > 0}. Let f ′ : Xm+1 → [0, 1] be
a continuous extension of f , and let V = {x ∈ Xm+1 : f ′(x) > 0}. Then V is a paracompact open subset
of Xm+1, and Um can be identiﬁed with a closed subset of V . Applying Corollary 7.1.5.5 to the restriction
Fn+1 |V , we deduce the existence of an open set Um+1 ⊆ V such that ηk can be extended to a section
ηk+1 ∈ π0 Fm+1(Um+1). Shrinking Um+1 if necessary, we may assume that Um+1 is itself an Fσ, which
completes the induction.

Remark 7.1.5.10. Suppose given a given a sequence of closed embeddings of topological spaces

X0 ⊆ X1 ⊆ X2 ⊆ . . . ,

and let X be the direct limit of the sequence. Suppose further that:

(a) For each n ≥ 0, the space Xn is paracompact.

(b) For each n ≥ 0, there exists an open neighborhood Yn of Xn in Xn+1 and a retraction rn of Yn onto

Xn.

Then X is itself paracompact, so that the hypotheses of Proposition 7.1.5.8 are satisﬁed and Shv(X) is the
direct limit of the sequence of ∞-topoi {Shv(Xn)}n≥0. To prove this, it will suﬃce every open covering
{Uα}α∈A of X admits a reﬁnement {Vβ}β∈B which is countably locally ﬁnite: that is, there exists a decom-
n≥0 Bn such that each of the collections {Vβ}β∈Bn is a locally ﬁnite collection of open sets,
position B =
each of which is contained in some Uα (see [59]). To construct this locally ﬁnite open covering, we choose
for each n ≥ 0 a locally ﬁnite open covering {Wβ}β∈Bn of Xn which reﬁnes the covering {Uα ∩ Xn}α∈A. For
each β ∈ Bn, we have Wβ ⊆ Uα for some α ∈ A. We now deﬁne Vβ to be the union of a collection of open
subsets {Vβ(m) ⊆ Xm}m≥n, which are constructed as follows:

Ym−1. We then set Vβ (m) = {z ∈ Zm−1 : rm−1(z) ∈ Vβ(m − 1)} ∩ Uα.

It is clear that each Vβ (m) is an open subset of Xm contained in Uα, and that Vβ (m + 1) ∩ Xm = Vβ(m).
m Vβ(m) is open in X. The only
Since X is equipped with the direct limit topology, the union Vβ =
nontrivial point is to verify that the collection {Vβ}β∈Bn is locally ﬁnite.
S

Pick a point x ∈ X; we wish to prove the existence of a neighborhood Sx of x such that {β ∈ Bn :
S ∩ Vβ 6= ∅} is ﬁnite. Then there exists some m ≥ n such that x ∈ Xm; we will construct Sx using induction
on m. If m > n and x ∈ Z m−1, then let x′ = rm−1(x), and set Sx = Sx′. If m > n and x /∈ Z m−1, or
if m = n, then we deﬁne Sx =
k≥m Sx(k), where Sx(k) is an open subset of Xk containing x, deﬁned as
follows. If m > n, let Sx(m) = Xm − Zm−1, and if m = n let Sx(m) be an open subset of Xn which intersects
only ﬁnitely many of the sets {Wβ}β∈Bn. If k > m, we let Sx(k) = {z ∈ Yk−1 : rk−1(z) ∈ Sx(k − 1)}. It is
not diﬃcult to verify that the open set Sx has the desired properties.

7.1.6 Higher Topoi and Shape Theory

If X is a suﬃciently nice topological space (for example, an absolute neighborhood retract), then there exists
a homotopy equivalence Y → X, where Y is a CW complex. If X is merely assumed to be paracompact,
then it is generally not possible to approximate X well by means of a CW-complex Y equipped with a map
to X. However, in view of Theorem 7.1.4.3, one can still extract a substantial amount of information by
considering maps from X to CW complexes. Shape theory is an attempt to summarize all of this information
in a single invariant, called the shape of X. In this section, we will sketch a generalization of shape theory
to the setting of ∞-topoi.

Deﬁnition 7.1.6.1. We let Pro(S) denote the full subcategory of Fun(S, S)op spanned by left exact, accessible
functors f : S → S. We will refer to Pro(S) as the ∞-category of pro-spaces, or as the ∞-category of shapes.

Remark 7.1.6.2. If C is a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits, then any functor f : C → S is
accessible and may be viewed as an object of P(Cop). The left exactness of f is then equivalent to the
condition that f belongs to Ind(Cop) = Pro(C)op. Deﬁnition 7.1.6.1 constitutes a natural extension of this
terminology to a case where C is not necessarily small; here it is convenient to add a hypothesis of accessibility
for technical reasons (which will not play any role in the discussion below).

Deﬁnition 7.1.6.3. Let X be an ∞-topos. According to Proposition 6.3.4.1, there exists a geometric
morphism q∗ : X → S, which is unique up to homotopy. Let q∗ be a left adjoint to q∗ (also unique up to
homotopy). The composition q∗q∗ : S → S is an accessible left-exact functor, which we will refer to as the
shape of X and denote by Sh(X) ∈ Pro(S).

Remark 7.1.6.4. This deﬁnition of the shape of an ∞-topos appears also in [78].

Remark 7.1.6.5. Let p∗ : Y → X be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi and p∗ a left adjoint to p∗. Let
q∗ : X → S and q∗ be as in Deﬁnition 7.1.6.3. The unit map idX → p∗p∗ induces a transformation

q∗q∗ → q∗p∗p∗q∗ ≃ (q ◦ p)∗(q ◦ p)∗,

which we may view as a map Sh(X) → Sh(Y) in Pro(S). Via this construction, we may view Sh as a
functor from the homotopy category hRTop of ∞-topoi to the homotopy category hPro(S). We will say that
a geometric morphism p∗ : Y → X is a shape equivalence if it induces an equivalence Sh(Y) → Sh(X) of
pro-spaces.

Remark 7.1.6.6. By construction, the shape of an ∞-topos X is well-deﬁned up to equivalence in Pro(S).
By reﬁning the above construction, it is possible construct a shape functor from RTop to the ∞-category
Pro(S), rather than on the level of homotopy.

563

Remark 7.1.6.7. Our terminology does not quite conform to the usage in classical topology. Recall that if
X is a compact metric space, the shape of X is deﬁned as a pro-object in the homotopy category of spaces.
There is a reﬁnement of shape, known as strong shape, which takes values in the homotopy category of
pro-spaces. Deﬁnition 7.1.6.3 is a generalization of strong shape, rather than shape. We refer the reader to
[55] for a discussion of classical shape theory.

Proposition 7.1.6.8. Let p : X → Y be a continuous map of paracompact topological spaces. Then p∗ :
Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) is a shape equivalence if and only if, for every Kan complex K, the induced map of Kan
complexes MapTop(Y, |K|) → MapTop(X, |K|) is a homotopy equivalence. (Here MapTop(Y, |K|) denotes the
simplicial set whose n-simplices are given by continuous maps Y × |∆n| → |K|, and MapTop(X, |K|) is
deﬁned likewise.)

Proof. Corollary 7.1.4.4 and Proposition 7.1.5.1 imply that for any paracompact topological space Z and
any Kan complex K, there is a natural isomorphism

in the homotopy category H.

Sh(Shv(Z))(K) ≃ MapTop(Z, |K|)

Example 7.1.6.9. Let X be a scheme, let X be the topos of ´etale sheaves on X, and let X be the associated
1-localic ∞-topos (see §6.4.5). The shape Sh(X) deﬁned above is closely related to the ´etale homotopy type
introduced by Artin and Mazur (see [3]). There are three important diﬀerences:

(1) Artin and Mazur work with pro-objects in the homotopy category H, rather than with actual pro-
objects of S. Our deﬁnition is closer in spirit to that of Friedlander, who works instead in the homotopy
category of pro-objects in Set∆ (see [30]).

(2) The ´etale homotopy type of [3] is constructed by considering ´etale hypercoverings of X; it is therefore

more closely related to the shape of the hypercompletion X∧.

(3) Artin and Mazur generally study a certain completion of Sh(X∧) with respect to the class of truncated
spaces, which has the eﬀect of erasing the distinction between X and X∧ and discarding a bit of
(generally irrelevant) information.

Remark 7.1.6.10. Let ∗ denote a topological space consisting of a single point. By deﬁnition, Shv(∗) is
the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, S) spanned by those morphisms f : X → Y where Y is a ﬁnal object of S.
We observe that Shv(∗) is equivalent to the full subcategory spanned by those morphisms f as above where
Y = ∆0 ∈ S, and that this full subcategory is isomorphic to S.

Deﬁnition 7.1.6.11. We will say that an ∞-topos X has trivial shape if Sh(X) is equivalent to the identity
functor S → S.

Remark 7.1.6.12. Let q∗ : X → S be a geometric morphism. Then the unit map u : idS → q∗q∗ induces a
map of pro-spaces Sh(X) → idS. Since idS is a ﬁnal object in Pro(S), we observe that X has trivial shape if
and only if u is an equivalence; in other words, if and only if the pullback functor q∗ is fully faithful.

We now sketch another interpretation of shape theory, based on the ∞-topoi associated to pro-spaces.
Let X = S, let π : S × S → S be the projection onto the ﬁrst factor, let δ : S → S × S denote the diagonal
map, and let φ : (S × S)/δS → S be deﬁned as in §4.2.2. Proposition 4.2.2.4 implies that φ is a coCartesian
ﬁbration. We may identify the ﬁber of φ over an object X ∈ S with the ∞-category S/X . For each morphism
f : X → Y in S, φ associates a functor f! : S/X → S/Y , given by composition with f . Since S admits
pullbacks, each f! admits a right adjoint f ∗, so that φ is also a Cartesian ﬁbration, associated to some
functor ψ : Sop → LTop.

Remark 7.1.6.14. Let G be a proﬁnite group, which we may identify with a Pro-object in the category

topos of sets with a continuous G-action. It follows from the construction of ﬁltered limits in RTop (see
§6.3.3) that we can describe objects Y ∈ S/BG informally as follows: Y associates to each open subgroup
U ⊆ G a space Y U of U -ﬁxed points, which depends functorially on the ﬁnite G-space G/U . Moreover, if
U is a normal subgroup of V , then the natural map from Y V to the (homotopy) ﬁxed point space (Y U )V /U

7.2 Dimension Theory

In this section, we will discuss the dimension theory of topological spaces from the point of view of higher
topos theory. We begin in §7.2.1 by introducing the homotopy dimension of an ∞-topos. We will show that
the ﬁniteness of the homotopy dimension of an ∞-topos X has pleasant consequences: it implies that every
object is the inverse limit of its Postnikov tower, and in particular that X is hypercomplete.

In §7.2.2, we deﬁne the cohomology groups of an ∞-topos X. These cohomology groups have a natural
interpretation in terms of the classiﬁcation of higher gerbes on X. Using this interpretation, we will show
that the cohomology dimension of an ∞-topos X almost coincides with its homotopy dimension.

In §7.2.3, we review the classical theory of covering dimension for paracompact topological spaces. Using
the results of §7.1, we will show that the covering dimension of a paracompact space X coincides with the
homotopy dimension of the ∞-topos Shv(X).

We conclude in §7.2.4 by introducing a dimension theory for Heyting spaces, which generalizes the classical
theory of Krull dimension for Noetherian topological spaces. Using this theory, we will prove an upper bound
for the homotopy dimension of Shv(X), for suitable Heyting spaces X. This result can be regarded as a
generalization of Grothendieck’s vanishing theorem for the cohomology of Noetherian topological spaces.

7.2.1 Homotopy Dimension

Throughout this section, we will use the symbol 1X to denote the ﬁnal object of an ∞-topos X.

Deﬁnition 7.2.1.1. Let X be an ∞-topos. We shall say that X has homotopy dimension ≤ n if every
n-connective object U ∈ X admits a global section 1X → U . We say that X has ﬁnite homotopy dimension
if there exists n ≥ 0 such that X has homotopy dimension ≤ n.

Example 7.2.1.2. An ∞-topos X is of homotopy dimension ≤ −1 if and only if X is equivalent to the trivial
∞-category ∗ (the ∞-topos of sheaves on the empty space ∅). The “if” direction is obvious. Conversely, if
X has homotopy dimension ≤ −1, then the initial object ∅ of X admits a global section 1X → ∅. For every
object X ∈ X, we have a map X → 1X → ∅, so that X is also initial (Lemma 6.1.3.6). Since the collection
of initial objects of X span a contractible Kan complex (Proposition 1.2.12.9), we deduce that X is itself a
contractible Kan complex.

Example 7.2.1.3. The ∞-topos S has homotopy dimension 0. More generally, if C is an ∞-category with
a ﬁnal object 1C, then P(C) has homotopy dimension ≤ 0. To see this, we ﬁrst observe that the Yoneda
embedding j : C → P(C) preserves limits, so that j(1C) is a ﬁnal object of P(C). To prove that P(C) has
homotopy dimension ≤ 0, we need to show that the functor P(C) → S corepresented by j(1C) preserves
eﬀective epimorphisms. This functor can be identiﬁed with evaluation at 1C. It therefore preserves all limits
and colimits, and so carries eﬀective epimorphisms to eﬀective epimorphisms by Proposition 6.2.3.7.

Example 7.2.1.4. Let X be a Kan complex, and let n ≥ −1. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The ∞-topos S/X has homotopy dimension ≤ n.

(2) The geometric realization |X| is a retract (in the homotopy category H) of a CW complex K of

dimension ≤ n.

To prove that (2) ⇒ (1), let us choose an n-connective object of X/X corresponding to a Kan ﬁbration
p : Y → X, whose homotopy ﬁbers are n-connective. Choose a map K → |X| which admits a right
homotopy inverse. To prove that p admits a section up to homotopy, tt will suﬃce to show that there exists
a dotted arrow

for k ≤ n.

To prove that (1) ⇒ (2), we choose any n-connective map q : K → |X|, where K is an n-dimensional
CW complex. Condition (1) guarantees that q admits a right homotopy inverse, so that |X| is a retract of
K in the homotopy category H.

Remark 7.2.1.5. If X is a coproduct (in the ∞-category RTop) of ∞-topoi Xα, then X is of homotopy
dimension ≤ n if and only if each Xα is of homotopy dimension ≤ n.

It is convenient to introduce a relative version of Deﬁnition 7.2.1.1.

Deﬁnition 7.2.1.6. Let f : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. We will say that f is of homotopy
dimension ≤ n if, for every k ≥ n and every k-connective morphism X → X ′ in X, the induced map
f∗X → f∗X ′ is a (k − n)-connective morphism in Y (since f∗ is well-deﬁned up to equivalence, this condition
is independent of the choice of f∗).

Lemma 7.2.1.7. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let F∗ : X → S be a geometric morphism (which is unique up to
equivalence). The following are equivalent:

(1) The ∞-topos X is of homotopy dimension ≤ n.

(2) The geometric morphism F∗ is of homotopy dimension ≤ n.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (2) is satisﬁed, and let X be an n-connective object of X. Then F∗X is a 0-
connective object of S: that is, it is a nonempty Kan complex. It therefore has a point 1S → F∗X. By
adjointness, we see that there exists a map 1X → X in X, where 1X = F ∗1S is a ﬁnal object of X because
F ∗ is left exact. This proves (1).

Now assume (1), and let s : X → Y be an k-connective morphism in X; we wish to show that F∗s is
If k = n, then are reduced to proving the

(k − n)-connective. The proof goes by induction on k ≥ n.
surjectivity of the horizontal maps in the diagram

Proposition 6.5.1.18 in the ∞-topos S deduce that F∗(s) is (k − n)-connective, as desired.

Deﬁnition 7.2.1.8. We will say that an ∞-topos X is locally of homotopy dimension ≤ n if there exists
a collection {Uα} of objects of X which generate X under colimits, such that each X/Uα is of homotopy
dimension ≤ n.

Example 7.2.1.9. Let C be a small ∞-category. Then P(C) is locally of homotopy dimension ≤ 0. To
prove this, we ﬁrst observe that P(C) is generated under colimits by the Yoneda embedding j : C → P(C).
It therefore suﬃces to prove that each of the ∞-topoi P(C)/j(C) has ﬁnite homotopy dimension. According
to Corollary 5.1.6.12, the ∞-topos P(C)/j(C) is equivalent to P(C/C ), which is of homotopy dimension 0 (see
Example 7.2.1.3).

Our next goal is to prove the following result:

Proposition 7.2.1.10. Let X be an ∞-topos which is locally of homotopy dimension ≤ n for some integer
n. Then Postnikov towers in X are convergent.

≥0)op → X be a limit
Proof. We will show that X satisﬁes the criterion of Remark 5.5.6.27. Let X : N(Z∞
tower, and assume that the underlying pretower is highly connected. We wish to show that X is highly
connected. Choose m ≥ −1; we wish to show that the map X(∞) → X(k) is m-connective for k ≫ 0.
Reindexing the tower if necessary, we may suppose that for every p ≥ q, the map X(p) → X(q) is (m + q)-
connective. We claim that, in this case, we can take k = 0. The proof goes by induction on m. If m > 0, we
can deduce the desired result by applying the inductive hypothesis to the tower

X(∞) → . . . X(∞) ×X(2) X(∞) → X(∞) ×X(1) X(∞) → X(∞) ×X(0) X(∞).

Let us therefore assume that m = 0; we wish to show that the map X(∞) → X(0) is an eﬀective epimorphism.
Since the objects {Uα} generate X under colimits, there is an eﬀective epimorphism φ : U → X(0), where
U is a coproduct of objects of the form {Uα}. Using Remark 7.2.1.5, we deduce that X/U has homotopy
dimension ≤ n. Let F : X → S denote the functor corepresented by U . Then F factors as a composition

X f ∗

→ X/U

Γ→ S,

where f ∗ is the left adjoint to the geometric morphism X/U → X and Γ is the global sections functor.
It follows that F carries n-connective morphisms to eﬀective epimorphisms (Lemma 7.2.1.7). The map φ
determines a point of F (X(0)). Since each of the maps F (X(k + 1)) → F (X(k)) induces a surjection on
connected components, we can lift this point successively to each F (X(k)) and thereby obtain a point in
F (X(∞)) ≃ holim{F (X(n))}. This point determines a diagram

≥0)op, X) be the ∞-category of towers in
Lemma 7.2.1.11. Let X be a presentable ∞-category, let Fun(N(Z∞
X, and let Xτ ⊆ Fun(N(Z∞
≥0)op, X) denote the full subcategory spanned by the Postnikov towers. Evaluation
at ∞ induces a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets Xτ → X. In particular, every object X(∞) ∈ X can be
extended to a Postnikov tower

X(∞) → . . . → X(1) → X(0).

≥0)op spanned by the pairs (X, n) where X is an object of X,
Proof. Let C be the full subcategory of X × N(Z∞
n ∈ Z∞
≥0, and X is n-truncated, and let p : C → X denote the natural projection. Since every m-truncated
object of X is also n-truncated for m ≥ n, it is easy to see that p is a Cartesian ﬁbration. Proposition 5.5.6.18
implies that each of the inclusion functors τ≤m X ⊆ τ≤n X has a left adjoint, so that p is also a coCartesian
ﬁbration (Corollary 5.2.2.5). By deﬁnition, Xτ can be identiﬁed with the simplicial set

≥0)(N(Z∞

≥0)♯, (Cop)♮)op

and X itself can be identiﬁed with

Map♭

N(Z∞

≥0)({∞}♯, (Cop)♮)op.

It now suﬃces to observe that the inclusion {∞}♯ ⊆ N(Z∞

≥0)♯ is marked anodyne.

Corollary 7.2.1.12 (Jardine). Let X be an ∞-topos which is locally of homotopy dimension ≤ n for some
integer n. Then X is hypercomplete.

Proof. Let X(∞) be an arbitrary object of X. By Lemma 7.2.1.11 we can ﬁnd a Postnikov tower

X(∞) → . . . → X(1) → X(0).

Since X(n) is n-truncated, it belongs to X∧ by Corollary 6.5.1.14. By Proposition 7.2.1.10, the tower exhibits
X(∞) as a limit of objects of X∧, so that X(∞) belongs to X∧ as well since the full subcategory X∧ ⊆ X is
stable under limits.

Lemma 7.2.1.13. Let X be an ∞-topos, n ≥ 0, X an (n + 1)-connective object of X, and f ∗ : X → X/X a
right adjoint to the projection X/X → X. Then f ∗ induces a fully faithful functor τ≤n X → τ≤n X/X which
restricts to an equivalence from τ≤n−1 X to τ≤n−1 X/X

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that f ∗ is fully faithful when restricted to the ∞-category of n-truncated objects of X.
Let Y, Z ∈ X be objects, where Y is n-truncated. We have a commutative diagram

MapX/X

(f ∗Y, f ∗Z)

MapX(X × Y, Z)

MapX(τ≤n(X × Y ), Z)

MapX(Y, Z)

MapX(τ≤nY, Z)

in the homotopy category H, where the horizontal arrows are homotopy equivalences. Consequently, to prove
that the left vertical map is a homotopy equivalence, it suﬃces to show that the projection τ≤n(X × Y ) →
τ≤nY is an equivalence. This follows immediately from Lemma 6.5.1.2 and our assumption that X is (n + 1)-
connective.

Now suppose that Y is an (n − 1)-truncated object of X/X . We wish to show that Y lies in the essential
image of f ∗|τ≤n−1 X. Let Y denote the image of Y in X, and let Y → Z exhibit Z as an (n − 1)-truncation
of Y in X. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the composition

u : Y u′

→ f ∗Y u′′

→ f ∗Z

569

o
o
O
O

is an equivalence in X/X . Since both Y and f ∗Z are (n − 1)-truncated, it suﬃces to prove that u is
n-connective. According to Proposition 6.5.1.16, it suﬃces to prove that u′ and u′′ are n-connective. Propo-
sition 5.5.6.28 implies that u′′ exhibits f ∗Z as an (n − 1)-truncation of f ∗Y , and is therefore n-connective.
We now complete the proof by showing that u′ is n-connective. Let v′ denote the image of image of u′ in
the ∞-topos X. According to Proposition 6.5.1.19, it will suﬃce to show that v′ is n-connective. We observe
that v′ is a section of the projection q : Y × X → Y . q : Y × X → Y . According to Proposition 6.5.1.20, it
will suﬃce to prove that q is (n + 1)-connective. Since q is a pullback of the projection X → 1X, Proposition
6.5.1.16 allows us to conclude the proof (since X is (n + 1)-connective, by assumption).

Lemma 7.2.1.13 has some pleasant consequences.

Proposition 7.2.1.14. Let X be an ∞-topos and let τ≤0 : X → τ≤0 X denote a left adjoint to the inclusion.
A morphism φ : U → X in X is an eﬀective epimorphism if and only if τ≤0(φ) is an eﬀective epimorphism
in the ordinary topos h(τ≤0 X).
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that φ is an eﬀective epimorphism. Let U• : N ∆op
+ → X be a ˇCech nerve of φ, so that
U• is a colimit diagram. Since τ≤0 is a left adjoint, τ≤0U• is a colimit diagram in τ≤0 X. Using Proposition
6.2.3.10, we deduce easily that τ≤0φ is an eﬀective epimorphism.
For the converse, choose a factorization of φ as a composition

φ′
→ V

φ′′
→ X

U

where φ′ is an eﬀective epimorphism and φ′′ is a monomorphism. Applying Lemma 7.2.1.13 to the ∞-
topos X/τ≤0X , we conclude that φ′′ is the pullback of a monomorphism i : V → τ≤0X. Since the eﬀective
epimorphism τ≤0(φ) factors through i, we conclude that i is an equivalence, so that φ′′ is likewise an
equivalence. It follows that φ is an eﬀective epimorphism as desired.

Proposition 7.2.1.14 can be regarded as a generalization of the following well-known property of the ∞-
category of spaces, which can itself be regarded as the ∞-categorical analogue of the second part of Fact
6.1.1.6:

Corollary 7.2.1.15. Let f : X → Y be a map of Kan complexes. Then f is an eﬀective epimorphism in
the ∞-category S if and only if the induced map π0X → π0Y is surjective.

Remark 7.2.1.16. It follows from Proposition 7.2.1.14 that the class of ∞-topoi having the form Shv(C),
where C is a small ∞-category, is not substantially larger than the class of ordinary topoi. More precisely,
every topological localization of P(C) can be obtained by inverting morphisms between discrete objects of
P(C). It follows that there exists a pullback diagram of ∞-topoi

Shv(C)

P(C)

Shv(N(hC))

/ P(N(hC))

where the ∞-topoi on the bottom line are 1-localic, and therefore determined by the ordinary topoi of
presheaves of sets on the homotopy category h C and sheaves of sets on h C, respectively.

Corollary 7.2.1.17. Let X be a topological space. Suppose that Shv(X) is locally of homotopy dimension
≤ n for some integer n. Then Shv(X) has enough points.

Proof. Note that every point x ∈ X gives rise to a point x∗ : Shv(∗) → Shv(X) of the ∞-topos Shv(X). Let
f : F → F′ be a morphism in Shv(X) such that x∗(f ) is an equivalence in S for each x ∈ X. We wish to prove
that f is an equivalence. According to Corollary 7.2.1.12, it will suﬃce to prove that f is ∞-connective. We
will prove by induction on n that f is n-connective. If n > 0, we simply apply the inductive hypothesis to

570

the diagonal morphism δ : F → F ×F′ F. We may therefore reduce to the case n = 0; we wish to show that f
is an eﬀective epimorphism. Since Shv(X) is generated under colimits by the sheaves χU associated to open
subsets U ⊆ X, we may assume without loss of generality that F′ = χU . We may now invoke Proposition
7.2.1.14 to reduce to the case where F is an object of τ≤0 Shv(X)/χU . This ∞-category is equivalent to the
nerve of the category of sheaves of sets on U . We are therefore reduced to proving that if F is a sheaf of sets
on U whose stalk Fx is a singleton at each point x ∈ U , then F has a global section, which is clear.

7.2.2 Cohomological Dimension

In classical homotopy theory, one can analyze a space X by means of its Postnikov tower

. . . τ≤nX

φn→ τ≤n−1X → . . . .

In this diagram, the homotopy ﬁber F of φn (n ≥ 1) is a space which has only a single nonvanishing homotopy
group, in dimension n. The space F is determined up to homotopy equivalence by πnF : in fact F is homotopy
equivalent to an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(πnF, n) which can be functorially constructed from the group
πnF . The study of these Eilenberg-MacLane spaces is of central interest, because (according to the above
analysis) they constitute basic building blocks out of which any arbitrary space can be constructed. Our
goal in this section is to generalize the theory of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces to the setting of an arbitrary
∞-topos X.

Deﬁnition 7.2.2.1. Let X be an ∞-category. A pointed object is a morphism X∗ : 1 → X in X, where 1 is
a ﬁnal object of X. We let X∗ denote the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, X) spanned by the pointed objects of
X.

A group object of X is a groupoid object U• : N ∆op → X for which U0 is a ﬁnal object of X. Let Grp(X)

denote the full subcategory of X∆ spanned by the group objects of X.

We will say that a pointed object 1 → X of an ∞-topos X is an Eilenberg-MacLane object of degree n
if X is n-truncated and n-connective. We let EMn(X) denote the full subcategory of X∗ spanned by the
Eilenberg-MacLane objects of degree n.

Example 7.2.2.2. Let C be an ordinary category which admits ﬁnite limits. A group object of C is an object
X ∈ C which is equipped with an identity section 1C → X, an inversion map X → X, and a multiplication
m : X × X → X, which satisfy the usual group axioms. Equivalently, a group object of C is an object X
together with a group structure on each morphism space HomC(Y, X), which depends functorially on Y . We
will denote the category of group objects of C by Grp(C). The ∞-category N(Grp(C)) is equivalent to the
∞-category of group objects of N(C), in the sense of Deﬁnition 7.2.2.1. Thus, the notion of a group object of
an ∞-category can be regarded as a generalization of the notion of a group object of an ordinary category.

Remark 7.2.2.3. Let X be an ∞-topos and n ≥ 0 an integer. Then the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, X)
consisting of Eilenberg-MacLane objects p : 1 → X is stable under ﬁnite products. This is clear, since:

(1) A ﬁnite product of n-connective objects of X is n-connective (Corollary 6.5.1.13).

(2) Any limit of n-truncated objects of X is n-truncated (since τ≤n X is a localization of X).

Proposition 7.2.2.4. Let X be an ∞-category, and let U• be a simplicial object of X. Then U• is a group
object of X if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The object U0 is ﬁnal in X.

(2) For every decomposition [n] = S ∪ S′, where S ∩ S′ = {s}, the maps

exhibit Un as a product of U (S) and U (S) in X.

U (S) ← Un → U (S′)

571

Proof. This follows immediately from characterization (4′′) of Proposition 6.1.2.6.

Corollary 7.2.2.5. Let X and Y be ∞-categories which admit ﬁnite products, and let f : X → Y be a functor
which preserves ﬁnite products. Then the induced functor X∆ → Y∆ carries group objects of X to group
objects of Y.

Corollary 7.2.2.6. Let X be an ∞-category which admits ﬁnite products, and let Y ⊆ X be a full subcategory
which is stable under ﬁnite products. Let Y• be a simplicial object of Y. Then Y• is a group object of Y if
and only if it is a group object of X.

Deﬁnition 7.2.2.7. Let X be an ∞-category. A zero object of X is an object which is both initial and ﬁnal.

Lemma 7.2.2.8. Let X be an ∞-category with a ﬁnal object 1X. Then the inclusion i : X1X/ ⊆ X∗ is an
equivalence of ∞-categories.

Proof. Let K be the full subcategory of X spanned by the ﬁnal objects, and let 1X be an object of K.
Proposition 1.2.12.9 implies that K is a contractible Kan complex, so that the inclusion {1X} ⊆ K is an
equivalence of ∞-categories. Corollary 2.4.7.12 implies that the projection X∗ → K is a coCartesian ﬁbration.
We now apply Proposition 3.3.1.3 to deduce the desired result.

Lemma 7.2.2.9. Let X be an ∞-category with a ﬁnal object. Then the ∞-category X∗ has a zero object. If
X already has a zero object, then the forgetful functor X∗ → X is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Proof. Let 1X be a ﬁnal object of X, and let U = id1X ∈ X∗. We wish to show that U is a zero object of
X∗. According to Lemma 7.2.2.8, it will suﬃce to show that U is a zero object of X1X/. It is clear that U is
initial, and the ﬁnality of U follows from Proposition 1.2.13.8.

For the second assertion, let us suppose that 1X is also an initial object of X. We wish to show that the
forgetful functor X∗ → X is an equivalence of ∞-categories. Applying Lemma 7.2.2.8, it will suﬃce to show
that the projection f : X1X/ → X is an equivalence of ∞-categories. But f is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial
sets.

Lemma 7.2.2.10. Let X be an ∞-category, and let f : X∗ → X be the forgetful functor ( which carries a
pointed object 1 → X to X ). Then f induces an equivalence of ∞-categories

Grp(X∗) → Grp(X).

Proof. The functor f factors as a composition

X∗ ⊆ Fun(∆1, X) → X

where the ﬁrst map is the inclusion of a full subcategory which is stable under limits, and the second map
preserves all limits (Proposition 5.1.2.2). It follows that f preserves limits, and therefore composition with
f induces a functor F : Grp(X∗) → Grp(X) by Corollary 7.2.2.5.

Observe that the 0-simplex ∆0 is an initial object of ∆op. Consequently, there exists a functor T :
∆1 × N(∆)op → N(∆)op, which is a natural transformation from the constant functor taking the value ∆0
to the identity functor. Composition with T induces a functor

X∆ → Fun(∆1, X)∆.

Restricting to group objects, we get a functor s : Grp(X) → Grp(X∗). It is clear that F ◦ s is the identity.

We observe that if X has a zero object, then f is an equivalence of ∞-categories (Lemma 7.2.2.9). It
follows immediately that F is an equivalence of ∞-categories. Since s is a right inverse to F , we conclude
that s is an equivalence of ∞-categories as well.

572

To complete the proof in the general case, it will suﬃce to show that the composition s◦F is an equivalence
of ∞-categories. To prove this, we set Y = X∗, and let F ′ : Grp(Y∗) → Grp(X∗) and s′ : Grp(Y) → Grp(Y∗)
be deﬁned as above. We then have a commutative diagram

Grp(Y)

F

Grp(X)

s′

s

Grp(Y∗)

F ′

/ Grp(X∗)

so that s ◦ F = F ′ ◦ s′. Lemma 7.2.2.9 implies that Y has a zero object, so that F ′ and s′ are equivalences
of ∞-categories. Therefore F ′ ◦ s′ = s ◦ F is an equivalence of ∞-categories, and the proof is complete.

The following Proposition guarantees a good supply of Eilenberg-MacLane objects in an ∞-topos X.

Lemma 7.2.2.11. Let X be an ∞-topos containing a ﬁnal object 1X and let n ≥ 1. Let p denote the
composition

Fun(∆1, X)
which associates to each morphism U → X the underlying groupoid of its ˇCech nerve. Then:

ˇC→ X∆+ → X∆

(1) Let X′ denote the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, X) consisting of connected pointed objects of X. Then

the restriction of p induces an equivalence of ∞-categories from X′ to the ∞-category Grp(X).

(2) The essential image of p| EMn(X) coincides with the essential image of the composition

Grp(EMn−1(X)) ⊆ Grp(X∗) → Grp(X).

Proof. Let X′′ be the full subcategory of Fun(∆1, X) spanned by the eﬀective epimorphisms u : U → X.
Since X is an ∞-topos, p induces an equivalence from X′′ to the ∞-category of groupoid objects of X.
Consequently, to prove (1), it will suﬃce to show that if u : 1X → X is a morphism in X and 1X is a ﬁnal
object, then u is an eﬀective epimorphism if and only if X is connected. We note that X is connected if
and only if the map τ≤0(u) : τ≤01X → τ≤0X is an isomorphism in the ordinary topos Disc(X). According
to Proposition 7.2.1.14, u is an eﬀective epimorphism if and only if τ≤0(u) is an eﬀective epimorphism. We
now observe that in any ordinary category C, an eﬀective epimorphism u′ : 1C → X ′ whose source is a ﬁnal
object of C is automatically an isomorphism, since the equivalence relation 1C ×X ′ 1C ⊆ 1C ×1C automatically
consists of the whole of 1C × 1C ≃ 1C.

To prove (2), we consider an augmented simplicial object X• of X which is a ˇCech nerve, having the
property that X0 is a ﬁnal object of X. We wish to show that the pointed object X0 → X−1 belongs to
EMn(X) if and only if each Xk is (n − 1)-truncated and (n − 1)-connective, for k ≥ 0. We conclude by
making the following observations:

(a) Since Xk is equivalent to a k-fold product of copies of X1, the objects Xk are (n − 1)-truncated

((n − 1)-connective) for all k ≥ 0 if and only if X1 is (n − 1)-truncated ((n − 1)-connective).

(b) We have a pullback diagram

X1

X0

f

g

X0

g

/ X−1.

The object X1 is (n − 1)-truncated if and only if f is (n − 1)-truncated. Since g is an eﬀective
epimorphism, f is (n − 1)-truncated if and only if g is (n − 1)-truncated (Proposition 6.2.3.17). Using
the long exact sequence of Remark 6.5.1.5, we conclude that this is equivalent to the vanishing of
g∗πkX−1 for k > n. Since g is an eﬀective epimorphism, this is equivalent to the vanishing of πkX−1
for k > n; in other words, to the requirement that X−1 is n-truncated.

(c) The object X1 is (n−1)-connective if and only if f is (n−1)-connective. Arguing as above, we conclude
that f is (n − 1)-connective if and only if g is (n − 1)-connective (Proposition 6.5.1.16). Using the long
exact sequence of Remark 6.5.1.5, this is equivalent to the vanishing of the homotopy sheaf g∗πkX−1
for k < n. Since g is an eﬀective epimorphism, this is equivalent to the vanishing of πkX−1 for k < n;
in other words, to the condition that X−1 is (n − 1)-truncated.

Proposition 7.2.2.12. Let X be an ∞-topos and n ≥ 0 a nonnegative integer, and let πn : X∗ → N(Disc(X))
denote the associated homotopy group functor.

Then:

(1) If n = 0, then πn determines an equivalence from the ∞-category EM0(X) to the (nerve of the) category

of pointed objects of Disc(X).

(2) If n = 1, then πn determines an equivalence from the ∞-category EM1(X) to the (nerve of the) category

of group objects of Disc(X).

(3) If n ≥ 2, then πn determines an equivalence from the ∞-category EMn(X) to the (nerve of the) category

of commutative group objects of Disc(X).

Proof. We use induction on n. The case n = 0 follows immediately from the deﬁnitions. The case n = 1
follow from the case n = 0, by combining Lemmas 7.2.2.11 and 7.2.2.10. If n = 2, we apply the inductive
hypothesis, together with Lemma 7.2.2.11 and the observation that if C is an ordinary category which admits
ﬁnite products, then Grp(Grp(C)) is equivalent to category Ab(C) of commutative group objects of C. The
argument in the case n > 2 makes use of the inductive hypothesis, Lemma 7.2.2.11, and the observation that
Grp(Ab(C)) is equivalent to Ab(C) for any ordinary category C which admits ﬁnite products.

Fix an ∞-topos X, a ﬁnal object 1X ∈ X, and an integer n ≥ 0. According to Proposition 7.2.2.12, there

exists a homotopy inverse to the functor π. We will denote this functor by

A 7→ (p : 1X → K(A, n))

where A is a pointed object of the topos Disc(X) if n = 0, a group object if n = 1, and an abelian group
object if n ≥ 2.

Remark 7.2.2.13. The functor A 7→ K(A, n) preserves ﬁnite products. This is clear, since the class of
Eilenberg-MacLane objects is stable under ﬁnite products (Remark 7.2.2.3) and the homotopy inverse functor
π commutes with ﬁnite products (since homotopy groups are constructed using pullback and truncation
functors, each of which commutes with ﬁnite products).

Deﬁnition 7.2.2.14. Let X be an ∞-topos, n ≥ 0 an integer, and A an abelian group object of the topos
Disc(X). We deﬁne

Hn(X; A) = π0 MapX(1X, K(A, n));

we refer to Hn(X; A) as the nth cohomology group of X with coeﬃcients in A.

Remark 7.2.2.15. It is clear that we can also make sense of H1(X; G) when G is a sheaf of nonabelian
groups, or H0(X; E) when E is only a sheaf of (pointed) sets.

Remark 7.2.2.16. It is clear from the deﬁnition that Hn(X; A) is functorial in A. Moreover, this functor
commutes with ﬁnite products by Remark 7.2.2.13 (and the fact that products in X are products in the
homotopy category h X).
If A is an abelian group, then the multiplication map A × A → A induces a
(commutative) group structure on Hn(X; A). This justiﬁes our terminology in referring to Hn(X; A) as a
cohomology group.

574

Remark 7.2.2.17. Let C be a small category equipped with a Grothendieck topology, and let X be the ∞-
topos Shv(N C) of sheaves of spaces on C, so that the underlying topos Disc(X) is equivalent to the category
of sheaves of sets on C. Let A be a sheaf of abelian groups on C. Then Hn(X; A) may be identiﬁed with the
nth cohomology group of Disc(X) with coeﬃcients in A, in the sense of ordinary sheaf theory. To see this,
choose a resolution

A → I 0 → I 1 → . . . → I n−1 → J

of A by abelian group objects of Disc(X), where each I k is injective. The complex

I 0 → . . . → J

may be identiﬁed, via the Dold-Kan correspondence, with a simplicial abelian group object C• of Disc(X).
Regard C• as a presheaf on C with values in Set∆. Then:

(1) The induced presheaf F : N(C)op → S belongs to X = Shv(N(C)) ⊆ P(N(C)) (this uses the injectivity

of the objects I k) and is equipped with a canonical basepoint p : 1X → F .

(2) The pointed object p : 1X → F is an Eilenberg-MacLane object of X, and there is a canonical identiﬁ-

cation A ≃ p∗(πnF ). We may therefore identify F with K(A, n).

(3) The set of homotopy classes of maps from 1X to F in X may be identiﬁed with the cokernel of the map
Γ(Disc(X); I n−1) → Γ(Disc(X); J), which is also the nth cohomology group of Disc(X) with coeﬃcients
in A in the sense of classical sheaf theory.

For further discussion of this point, we refer the reader to [41].

We are ready to deﬁne the cohomological dimension of an ∞-topos.

Deﬁnition 7.2.2.18. Let X be an ∞-topos. We will say that X has cohomological dimension ≤ n if, for
any sheaf of abelian groups A on X, the cohomology group Hk(X, A) vanishes for k > n.

Remark 7.2.2.19. For small values of n, some authors prefer to require a stronger vanishing condition which
applies also when A is a non-abelian coeﬃcient system. The appropriate deﬁnition requires the vanishing of
cohomology for coeﬃcient systems which are deﬁned only up to inner automorphisms, as in [31]. With the
appropriate modiﬁcations, Theorem 7.2.2.29 below remains valid for n < 2.

The cohomological dimension of an ∞-topos X is closely related to the homotopy dimension of X. If X

has homotopy dimension ≤ n, then

Hm(X; A) = π0 MapX(1X, K(A, m)) = ∗

for m > n by Lemma 7.2.1.7, so that X is also of cohomological dimension ≤ n. We will establish a partial
converse to this result.

Deﬁnition 7.2.2.20. Let X be an ∞-topos. An n-gerbe on X is an object X ∈ X which is n-connective and
n-truncated.

Let X be an ∞-topos containing an n-gerbe X, and let f : X/X → X denote the associated geometric
morphism. If X is equipped with a base point p : 1X → X, then X is canonically determined (as a pointed
object) by p∗πnX, by Proposition 7.2.2.12. We now wish to consider the case in which X is not pointed. If
n ≥ 2, then πnX can be regarded as an abelian group object in the topos Disc(X/X ). Proposition 7.2.1.13
implies that πnX ≃ f ∗A, where A is a sheaf of abelian groups on X, which is determined up to canonical
isomorphism. (In concrete terms, this boils down the observation that the 1-connectivity of X allows us to
extract higher homotopy groups without specifying a basepoint on X. ) In this situation, we will say that
X is banded by A.

Remark 7.2.2.21. For n < 2, the situation is more complicated. We refer the reader to [31] for a discussion.

575

Our next goal is to show that the cohomology groups of an ∞-topos X can be interpreted as classifying

equivalence classes of n-gerbes over X. Before we can prove this, we need to establish some terminology.

Notation 7.2.2.22. Let X be an ∞-topos. We deﬁne a category Band(X) as follows:

(1) The objects of Band(X) are pairs (U, A), where U is an object of X and A is an abelian group object

of the homotopy category Disc(X/U ).

(2) Morphisms from (U, A) to (U ′, A′) are given by pairs (η, f ), where η ∈ π0 MapX(U, U ′) and f : A → A′
is a map which induces an isomorphism A ≃ η∗A′ of abelian group objects. Composition of morphisms
is deﬁned in the obvious way.

For n ≥ 2, let Gerbn(X) denote the subcategory of Fun(∆1, X) spanned by those objects f : X → S

which are n-gerbes in X/S and those morphisms which correspond to pullback diagrams

X ′

f

S′

X

f

/ S.

Remark 7.2.2.23. Since the class of morphisms f : X → S which belong to X∆1
is stable under pullback,
we can apply Corollary 2.4.7.12 (which asserts that p : Fun(∆1, X) → Fun({1}, X) is a Cartesian ﬁbration),
Lemma 6.1.1.1 (which characterizes the p-Cartesian morphisms of Fun(∆1, X)), and Corollary 2.4.2.5 to
deduce that the projection Gerbn(X) → X is a right ﬁbration.

If f : X → U belongs to Gerbn(X), then there exists an abelian group object A of Disc(X/U ) such that

X is banded by A. The construction

determines a functor

(f : X → U ) 7→ (U, A)

χ : Gerbn(X) → N(Band(X)).

Let A be an abelian group object of Disc(X). We let BandA(X) be the category whose objects are triples
(X, AX , φ), where X ∈ hX, AX is an abelian group object of Disc(X/X ), and φ is a map AX → A which
induces an isomorphism AX ≃ A × X of abelian group objects of Disc(X/X ). We have forgetful functors

BandA(X)

φ
→ Band(X) → hX,

both of which are Grothendieck ﬁbrations and whose composition is an equivalence of categories. We deﬁne
GerbA

n (X) by the following pullback diagram:

GerbA

n (X)

Gerbn(X)

χ

N(BandA(X))

/ N(Band(X)).

Note that since φ is a Grothendieck ﬁbration, N φ is a Cartesian ﬁbration (Remark 2.4.2.2), so that the
diagram above is homotopy Cartesian ( Proposition 3.3.1.3 ). We will refer to GerbA
n (X) as the sheaf of
gerbes over X banded by A.

Lemma 7.2.2.24. Let X be an ∞-topos, n ≥ 1, and A an abelian group object in the topos Disc(X). Let X
be an n-gerbe in X equipped with a ﬁxed isomorphism φ : πnX ≃ X ×A of abelian group objects of Disc(X/X ),
and let u : 1X → K(A, n) be an Eilenberg-MacLane object of X classiﬁed by A. Let Mapφ
X(K(A, n), X) be the
summand of MapX(K(A, n), X) corresponding to those maps f : K(A, n) → X for which the composition

A × K(A, n) ≃ πnK(A, n) → f ∗(πnX)

f ∗φ
→ A × K(A, n)

is the identity ( in the category of abelian group objects of X/K(A,n) ). Then composition with u induces a
homotopy equivalence

θφ : Mapφ

X(K(A, n), X) → MapX(1X, X).

Proof. Let θ : MapX(K(A, n), X) → MapX(1X, X), and let f : 1X → X be any map (which we may identify
with an Eilenberg-MacLane object of X. The homotopy ﬁber of θ over the point represented by f can be
identiﬁed with MapX1X /(u, f ). In view of the equivalence between X1X/ and X∗, we can identify this mapping
space with MapX∗ (u, f ). Applying Proposition 7.2.2.12, we deduce that the homotopy ﬁber of θ is equivalent
to the (discrete) set of all endomorphisms v : A → A (in the category of group objects of Disc(X)). We now
observe that the homotopy ﬁber of θφ over f is a summand of the homotopy ﬁber of θ over f , corresponding
to those components for which v = idA. It follows that the homotopy ﬁbers of θφ are contractible, so that
θφ is a homotopy equivalence as desired.

Lemma 7.2.2.25. Let X be an ∞-topos, n ≥ 1, and A an abelian group object of Disc(X). Let f :
K(A, n) × X → X be a trivial n-gerbe over X banded by A, and g :
Y → Y any n-gerbe over Y banded by
A. Then there is a canonical homotopy equivalence

Proof. Choose a morphism α : idX → f in X/X as depicted below:

A × (K(A, n) × X) (in the category of group objects of Disc(X/K(A,n)×X )), and θ with the map given by
composition with s. Invoking Lemma 7.2.2.24 in the ∞-topos X/X , we deduce that the map θ in the diagram

Theorem 7.2.2.26. Let X be an ∞-topos, n ≥ 1, and A an abelian group object of Disc(X). Then:

(1) The composite map

θ : GerbA

n (X) → Gerbn(X) ⊆ Fun(∆1, X) → Fun({1}, X) ≃ X

(2) The right ﬁbration θ is representable by an Eilenberg-MacLane object K(A, n + 1).

Proof. For each object X ∈ X, we let AX denote the projection A × X → X, viewed as an abelian group
object of Disc(X/X ). The functor φ : BandA(X) → Band(X) is a ﬁbration in groupoids, so that N φ is a right
ﬁbration (Proposition 2.1.1.3). The functor θ admits a factorization

where θ′′ is a right ﬁbration (Remark 7.2.2.23) and θ′ is a pullback of N φ, and therefore also a right ﬁbration.
It follows that θ, being a composition of right ﬁbrations, is a right ﬁbration; this proves (1).

To prove (2), we consider an Eilenberg-MacLane object u : 1X → K(A, n+1). Since K(A, n+1) is (n+1)-
truncated and 1X is n-truncated (in fact, (−2)-truncated), Lemma 5.5.6.14 implies that u is n-truncated.
The long exact sequence

. . . → u∗πi+1K(A, n + 1) → πiu → πi(1X) → i∗πi(K(A, n + 1)) → πi−1(u) → . . .

of Remark 6.5.1.5 shows that u is n-connective, and provides an isomorphism φ : A ≃ πn(u) in the category
of group objects of Disc(X), so that we may view the pair (u, φ) as an object of GerbA
n (X). Since 1X is a
ﬁnal object of X, Lemma 7.2.2.25 implies that (u, φ) is a ﬁnal object of GerbA
n (X), so that the right ﬁbration
θ is representable by θ(u, φ) = K(A, n + 1).

Corollary 7.2.2.27. Let X be an ∞-topos, n ≥ 2, and A an abelian group object of Disc(X). There is a
canonical bijection of Hn+1(X; A) with the set of equivalence classes of n-gerbes on X banded by A.

Remark 7.2.2.28. Under the correspondence of Proposition 7.2.2.27, an n-gerbe X on X admits a global
section 1X → X if and only if the associated cohomology class in Hn+1(X; A) vanishes.

Theorem 7.2.2.29. Let X be an ∞-topos and n ≥ 2. Then X has cohomological dimension ≤ n if and only
if it satisﬁes the following condition: any n-connective, truncated object of X admits a global section.

Proof. Suppose that X has the property that every n-connective, truncated object X ∈ X admits a global
section. As in the proof of Lemma 7.2.1.7, we deduce that for any truncated, (n + 1)-connective object
X ∈ X, the space of global sections MapX(1, X) is connected. Let k > n, and let G be a sheaf of abelian
groups on X. Then K(G, k) is (n+1)-connective, so that Hk(X, G) = ∗. Thus X has cohomological dimension
≤ n.

For the converse, let us assume that X has cohomological dimension ≤ n and let X denote an n-connective,
k-truncated object of X. We will show that X admits a global section by descending induction on k. If
k ≤ n − 1, then X is a ﬁnal object of X, so there is nothing to prove. In the general case, choose a truncation
X → τ≤k−1X; we may assume by the inductive hypothesis that τ≤k−1X has a global section s : 1 → τ≤k−1X.

It now suﬃces to prove that X ′ has a global section. We note that X ′ is k-connective, where k ≥ n ≥ 2. It
follows that X ′ is a k-gerbe on X; suppose it is banded by an abelian group object A ∈ Disc(X). According
to Corollary 7.2.2.27, X ′ is classiﬁed up to equivalence by an element in Hk+1(X, A), which vanishes in virtue
of the fact that k + 1 > n and the cohomological dimension of X is ≤ n. Consequently, X ′ is equivalent to
K(A, k) and therefore admits a global section.

Corollary 7.2.2.30. Let X be an ∞-topos. If X has homotopy dimension ≤ n, then X has cohomological
dimension ≤ n. The converse holds provided that X has ﬁnite homotopy dimension and n ≥ 2.

Proof. Only the last claim requires proof. Suppose that X has cohomological dimension ≤ n and homotopy
dimension ≤ k. We must show that every n-connective object X of X has a global section. Choose a
truncation X → τ≤k−1X. Then τ≤k−1X is truncated and n-connective, so it admits a global section by

It now suﬃces to prove that X ′ has a global section. But X ′ is k-connective, and therefore has a global
section in virtue of the assumption that X has homotopy dimension ≤ k.

Warning 7.2.2.31. [Weiland] The converse to Corollary 7.2.2.30 is false if we do not assume that X has ﬁnite
homotopy dimension. To see this, we discuss the following example, which we learned from Ben Wieland.
Let G denote the group Zp of p-adic integers (viewed as a proﬁnite group). Let C denote the category whose
objects are the ﬁnite quotients {Zp/pnZp}n≥0, and whose morphisms are given by G-equivariant maps.
We regard C as endowed with a Grothendieck topology in which every nonempty sieve is a covering. The
∞-topos Shv(N C) is 1-localic, and the underlying ordinary topos hτ≤0 Shv(N C) can be identiﬁed with the
category BG of continuous G-sets (that is, sets C equipped with an action of G such that the stabilizer of
each element x ∈ C is an open subgroup of G). Since the proﬁnite group G has cohomology dimension 2 (see
[69]), we deduce that X is of cohomological dimension 2. However, we will show that X is not hypercomplete,
and therefore cannot be of ﬁnite homotopy dimension.

Let K be a ﬁnite CW complex whose homotopy groups consist entirely of p-torsion (for example, we could
take K to be a Moore space M (Z/pZ)), and let X = Sing K ∈ S. Let F : N(C)op → S denote the constant
functor taking the value X. We claim that F belongs to Shv(C). Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we must show
that for each m ≤ n, the diagram F exhibits F (Zp/pmZp) as equivalent to the homotopy invariants for the
trivial action of pmZp/pnZp on F (Zp/pnZp). In other words, we must show that the diagonal embedding

α : X → Fun(BH, X)

is a homotopy equivalence, where H denotes the quotient group pmZp/pnZp. Since both sides are p-adically
complete, it will suﬃce to show that α is a p-adic homotopy equivalence, which follows from a suitable
version of the Sullivan conjecture (see, for example, [67]).

We deﬁne another functor F ′ : N(C)op → S, which is obtained as the simplicial nerve of the functor

described by the formula

Zp/pnZp 7→ Sing(K

R /pnZ

).

For m ≤ n, the loop space K R /pmZ can be identiﬁed with the homotopy ﬁxed points of the (nontrivial)
action of H = pmZp/pnZp ≃ pmZ/pnZ on the loop space K R /pnZ: this follows from the observation that
H acts freely on R /pnZ, with quotient R /pmZ. Consequently, F ′ belongs to Shv(N(C)).

The inclusion of K into each loop space K R /pnZ induces a morphism α : F → F ′ in the ∞-topos
Shv(N(C)). Using the fact that the homotopy groups of K are p-torsion, we deduce that the morphism α is
∞-connective (this follows from the observation that the map

X ≃ lim
−→

F (Zp/pnZp) → lim
−→

F ′(Z/pnZP )

is a homotopy equivalence). However, the morphism α is not an equivalence in Shv(N(C)) unless K is essen-
tially discrete. Consequently, Shv(N(C)) is not hypercomplete, and therefore cannot be of ﬁnite homotopy
dimension.

In spite of Warning 7.2.2.31, many situations which guarantee that a topological space (or topos) X is
of bounded cohomological dimension also guarantee that the associated ∞-topos is of bounded homotopy
dimension. We will see some examples in the next two sections.

7.2.3 Covering Dimension

In this section, we will review the classical theory of covering dimension for paracompact spaces, and then
show that the covering dimension of a paracompact space X coincides with its homotopy dimension.

Deﬁnition 7.2.3.1. A paracompact topological space X has covering dimension ≤ n if the following con-
dition is satisﬁed: for any open covering {Uα} of X, there exists an open reﬁnement {Vα} of X such that
each intersection Vα0 ∩ . . . ∩ Vαn+1 = ∅ provided the αi are pairwise distinct.

580

Remark 7.2.3.2. When X is paracompact, the condition of Deﬁnition 7.2.3.1 is equivalent to the (a priori
weaker) requirement that such a reﬁnement exist whenever {Uα} is a ﬁnite covering of X. This weaker
condition gives a good notion whenever X is a normal topological space. Moreover, if X is normal, then
the covering dimension of X (by this second deﬁnition) coincides with the covering dimension of the Stone-
ˇCech compactiﬁcation of X. Thus, the dimension theory of normal spaces is controlled by the dimension
theory of compact Hausdorﬀ spaces.

Remark 7.2.3.3. Suppose that X is a compact Hausdorﬀ space, which is written as a ﬁltered inverse limit of
compact Hausdorﬀ spaces {Xα}, each of which has dimension ≤ n. Then X has dimension ≤ n. Conversely,
any compact Hausdorﬀ space of dimension ≤ n can be written as a ﬁltered inverse limit of ﬁnite simplicial
complexes having dimension ≤ n. Thus, the dimension theory of compact Hausdorﬀ spaces is controlled by
the (completely straightforward) dimension theory of ﬁnite simplicial complexes.

Remark 7.2.3.4. There are other approaches to classical dimension theory. For example, a topological
space X is said to have small ( large ) inductive dimension ≤ n if every point of X (every closed subset of
X) has arbitrarily small open neighborhoods U such that ∂ U has small inductive dimension ≤ n − 1. These
notions are well-behaved for separable metric spaces, where they coincide with the covering dimension (and
with each other). In general, the covering dimension has better formal properties.

Our goal in this section is to prove that the covering dimension of a paracompact topological space X

coincides with the homotopy dimension of Shv(X). First, we need a technical lemma.

Lemma 7.2.3.5. Let X be a paracompact space, k ≥ 0, {Uα}α∈A be a covering of X. Suppose that for
Uα. Then
every A0 ⊆ A of size k + 1, we are given a covering {Vβ}β∈B(A0) of the intersection UA0 =

Theorem 7.2.3.6. Let X be a paracompact topological space of covering dimension ≤ n. Then the ∞-topos
Shv(X) of sheaves on X has homotopy dimension ≤ n.

Proof. We make use of the results and notations of §7.1. Let B denote the collection of all open Fσ subsets
of X, and ﬁx a linear ordering on B. We may identify Shv(X) with the simplicial nerve of the category of
all functors F : Bop → Kan which have the property that for any U ⊆ B with U =
V ∈U V , the natural
map F (U ) → F (U) is a homotopy equivalence.

S

581

Suppose that F : Bop → Set∆ represents an n-connective sheaf; we wish to show that the simplicial set
F (X) is nonempty. It suﬃces to prove that F (U) is nonempty, for some covering U of X; in other words, it
suﬃces to produce a map NU → F . The idea is that since X has ﬁnite covering dimension, we can choose
arbitrarily ﬁne covers U such that NU is n-dimensional; that is, equal to its n-skeleton.

For every simplicial set K, let K (i) denote the i-skeleton of K (the union of all nondegenerate simplices
of K of dimension ≤ i). If G : Bop → Set∆ is a simplicial presheaf, we let G(i) denote the simplicial presheaf
given by the formula

G(i)(U ) = (G(U ))(i).

We will prove the following statement by induction on i, −1 ≤ i ≤ n:

• There exists an open cover Ui ⊆ B of X and a map ηi : N (i)
Ui

→ F .

Assume that this statement holds for i = n. Passing to a reﬁnement, we may assume that the cover Un
has the property that no more than n + 1 of its members intersect (this is the step where we shall use the
assumption on the covering dimension of X). It follows that N (n)
= NUn , and the proof will be complete.
Un
To begin the induction in the case i = −1, we let U−1 = {X}; the (−1)-skeleton of NU−1 is empty, so

that η−1 exists (and is unique).

Now suppose that Ui = {Uα}α∈A and ηi have been constructed, i < n. Let A0 ⊆ A have cardinality
Uα; then A0 determines an n-simplex of NUi (U (A0)), so that ηi restricts to

α∈A0

(i + 2), and set U (A0) =
give a map

T

ηi,A0 : ∂ ∆i+1 → F (U (A0)).

By assumption, F is n-connective; it follows that there is an open covering

of U (A0), such for each Vβ there is a commutative diagram

{Vβ}β∈B(A0)

∂ ∆i+1(cid:127)

We apply Lemma 7.2.3.5 to this data, to obtain an new open cover Ui+1 = {W

(2) The homotopy dimension of Shv(X) is ≤ n.

(3) For every closed subset A ⊆ X, every m ≥ n, and every continuous map f0 : A → Sm, there exists

f : X → Sm extending f0.

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) is Theorem 7.2.3.6. The equivalence (1) ⇔ (3) follows from classical
dimension theory (see, for example, [27]). We will complete the proof by showing that (2) ⇒ (3). Let A
be a closed subset of X, m ≥ n, and f0 : A → Sm a continuous map. Let B be the collection of all open
Fσ subsets of X. We deﬁne a simplicial presheaf F : B → Kan, so that an n-simplex of F (U ) is a map f

commutative. To prove (3), it will suﬃce to show that F (X) is nonempty. In virtue of the assumption that
Shv(X) has homotopy dimension ≤ n, it will suﬃce to show that F is an n-connective sheaf on X.

We ﬁrst show that F is a sheaf. Choose a linear ordering on B. We must show that for every open
covering U of U ∈ B, the natural map F(U ) → F(U) is a homotopy equivalence. The proof is similar to that
of Proposition 7.1.3.14. Let π : |NU|X → U be the projection; then we may identify F (U) with the simplicial
set parametrizing continuous maps |NU|X → Sm, whose restriction to π−1(A) is given by f0. The desired
equivalence now follows from the fact that |NU|X is ﬁberwise homotopy equivalent to U (Lemma 7.1.3.13).
Now we claim that F is n-connective as an object of Shv(X). In other words, we must show that for any
U ∈ B, any k ≤ n, and any map g : ∂ ∆k → F (U ), there is an open covering {Uα} of U and a family of

x : Dk × {x} → Sm. Moreover,
k − 1 < n ≤ m, this map is nullhomotopic; therefore it admits an extension g′
if x ∈ A, then we may choose g′

an open neighborhood of (Sk−1 × U ) ∪ (Dk × (A ∪ {x})) in U × Dk. The compactness of Dk implies that W
contains Dk × Ux, where Ux ⊆ U is an open neighborhood of x. Shrinking Ux if necessary, we may suppose
that Ux belongs to B; these open sets Ux form an open cover of U , with the required extension ∆k → F (Ux)
supplied by the map g′′|Dk × Ux.

7.2.4 Heyting Dimension

For the purposes of studying paracompact topological spaces, Deﬁnition 7.2.3.1 gives a perfectly adequate
theory of dimension. However, there are other situations in which Deﬁnition 7.2.3.1 is not really appropriate.

For example, in algebraic geometry one often considers the Zariski topology on an algebraic variety X. This
topology is generally not Hausdorﬀ, and is typically of inﬁnite covering dimension. In this setting, there
is a better dimension theory: the theory of Krull dimension.
In this section, we will introduce a mild
generalization of the theory of Krull dimension, which we will call the Heyting dimension of a topological
space X. We will then study the relationship between the Heyting dimension of X and the homotopy
dimension of the associated ∞-topos Shv(X).

Recall that a topological space X is said to be Noetherian if the collection of closed subsets of X satisﬁes
the descending chain condition. A closed subset K ⊆ X is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as
a ﬁnite union of proper closed subsets of K (in particular, the empty set is not irreducible, since it can be
written as an empty union). The collection of irreducible closed subsets of X forms a well-founded partially
ordered set, therefore it has a unique ordinal rank function rk, which may be characterized as follows:

• If K is an irreducible closed subset of X, then rk(K) is the smallest ordinal which is larger than rk(K ′),

for all proper irreducible closed subsets K ′ ⊂ K.

We call rk(K) the Krull dimension of K; the Krull dimension of X is the supremum of rk(K), as K

ranges over all irreducible closed subsets of X.

We next introduce a generalization of the Krull dimension to a suitable class of non-Noetherian spaces.

We shall say that a topological space X is a Heyting space if satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) The compact open subsets of X form a basis for the topology of X.

(2) A ﬁnite intersection of compact open subsets of X is compact (in particular, X is compact).

(3) If U and V are compact open subsets of X, then the interior of U ∪ (X − V ) is compact.

Remark 7.2.4.1. Recall that a Heyting algebra is a distributive lattice L with the property that for any
x, y ∈ L, there exists a maximal element z with the property that x ∧ z ⊆ y. It follows immediately from our
deﬁnition that the lattice of compact open subsets of a Heyting space forms a Heyting algebra. Conversely,
given any Heyting algebra one may form its spectrum, which is a Heyting space. This sets up a duality
between the category of sober Heyting spaces (Heyting spaces in which every irreducible closed subset has a
unique generic point) and the category of Heyting algebras. This duality is a special case of a more general
duality between coherent topological spaces and distributive lattices. We refer the reader to [42] for further
details.

Remark 7.2.4.2. Suppose that X is a Noetherian topological space. Then X is a Heyting space, since
every open subset of X is compact.

Remark 7.2.4.3. If X is a Heyting space and U ⊆ X is a compact open subset, then X and X − U are
also Heyting spaces. In this case, we say that X − U is a cocompact closed subset of X.

We next deﬁne the dimension of a Heyting space. The deﬁnition is recursive. Let α be an ordinal.
A Heyting space X has Heyting dimension ≤ α if and only if, for any compact open subset U ⊆ X, the
boundary of U has Heyting dimension < α (we note that the boundary of U is also a Heyting space); a
Heyting space has Heyting dimension < 0 if and only if it is empty.

Remark 7.2.4.4. A Heyting space has dimension ≤ 0 if and only if it is Hausdorﬀ. The Heyting spaces of
dimension ≤ 0 are precisely the compact, totally disconnected Hausdorﬀ spaces. In particular, they are also
paracompact spaces and their Heyting dimension coincides with their covering dimension.

Proposition 7.2.4.5.

(1) Let X be a Heyting space of dimension ≤ α. Then for any compact open subset

U ⊆ X, both U and X − U have Heyting dimension ≤ α.

(2) Let X be a Heyting space which is a union of ﬁnitely many compact open subsets Uα of dimension ≤ α.

Then X has dimension ≤ α.

584

(3) Let X be a Heyting space which is a union of ﬁnitely many cocompact closed subsets Kα of Heyting

dimension ≤ α. Then X has Heyting dimension ≤ α.

Proof. All three assertions are proven by induction on α. The ﬁrst two are easy, so we restrict our attention
to (3). Let U be a compact open subset of X, having boundary B. Then U ∩ Kα is a compact open subset of
Kα, so that the boundary Bα of U ∩ Kα in Kα has dimension ≤ α. We see immediately that Bα ⊆ B ∩ Kα,
Bα then, for every β such that b ∈ Kβ, there exists a neighborhood
so that
Kγ.
Vβ containing b such that Vβ ∩ Kβ ∩ U = ∅. Let V be the intersection of the Vβ, and let W = V −
Then by construction, b ∈ W and W ∩ U = ∅, so that b ∈ B. Consequently, B =
Bα. Each Bα is closed
in Kα, thus in X and also in B. The hypothesis implies that Bα has dimension < α. Thus the inductive
hypothesis guarantees that B has dimension < α, as desired.

Bα ⊆ B. Conversely, if b /∈

Remark 7.2.4.6. It is not necessarily true that a Heyting space which is a union of ﬁnitely many locally
closed subsets of dimension ≤ α is also of dimension ≤ α. For example, a topological space with 2 points
and a nondiscrete, nontrivial topology has Heyting dimension 1, but is a union of two locally closed subsets
of Heyting dimension 0.

Proposition 7.2.4.7. If X is a Noetherian topological space, then the Krull dimension of X coincides with
the Heyting dimension of X.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove, by induction on α, that if the Krull dimension of a Noetherian space X is ≤ α, then
the Heyting dimension of X is ≤ α. Since X is Noetherian, it is a union of ﬁnitely many closed irreducible
subspaces, each of which automatically has Krull dimension ≤ α. Using Proposition 7.2.4.5, we may reduce
to the case where X is irreducible. Consider any open subset U ⊆ X, and let Y be its boundary. We must
show that Y has Heyting dimension ≤ α. Using Proposition 7.2.4.5 again, it suﬃces to prove this for each
irreducible component of Y . Now we simply apply the inductive hypothesis and the deﬁnition of the Krull
dimension.

For the reverse inequality, we again use induction on α. Assume that X has Heyting dimension ≤ α. To
show that X has Krull dimension ≤ α, we must show that every irreducible closed subset of X has Krull
dimension ≤ α. Without loss of generality we may assume that X is irreducible. Now, to show that X has
Krull dimension ≤ α, it will suﬃce to show that any proper closed subset K ⊆ X has Krull dimension < α.
By the inductive hypothesis, it will suﬃce to show that K has Heyting dimension < α. By the deﬁnition of
the Heyting dimension, it will suﬃce to show that K is the boundary of X − K. In other words, we must
show that X − K is dense in X. This follows immediately from the irreducibility of X.

We now prepare the way for our vanishing theorem. First, we introduce a modiﬁed notion of connectivity:

Deﬁnition 7.2.4.8. Let X be a Heyting space and k any integer. Let F ∈ Shv(V ) be a sheaf of spaces
on a compact open subset V ⊆ X. We will say that F is strongly k-connective if the following condition is
satisﬁed: for every compact open subset U ⊆ V and every map ζ : ∂ ∆m → F(U ), there exists a cocompact
closed subset K ⊆ U such that K ⊆ X has Heyting dimension < m − k, an open cover {Uα} of U − K, and
a collection of commutative diagrams

Remark 7.2.4.9. There is a slight risk of confusion with the terminology of Deﬁnition 7.2.4.8. The condition
that a sheaf F on V ⊆ X be strongly k-connective depends not only on V and F, but also on X: this is
because the Heyting dimension of a cocompact closed subset K ⊆ U can increase when we take its closure
K in X.

Remark 7.2.4.10. Strong k-connectivity is an unstable analogue of the connectivity conditions on com-
plexes of sheaves, associated to the dual of the standard perversity. For a discussion of perverse sheaves in
the abelian context we refer the reader to [6].

Remark 7.2.4.11. It is clear from the deﬁnition that a strongly k-connective sheaf F on V ⊆ X is k-
connective. Conversely, suppose that X has Heyting dimension ≤ n and that F is k-connective, then F is
strongly (k − n)-connected (if ∂ ∆m → F(U ) is any map, then we may take K = U for m > n and K = ∅
for m ≤ n).

The strong k-connectivity of a sheaf F is, by deﬁnition, a local property. The key to our vanishing result

is that this is equivalent to an apparently stronger global property.

Lemma 7.2.4.12. Let X be a Heyting space, V a compact open subset of X, and F : U(V )op → Kan a
strongly k-connective sheaf on V . Let A ⊆ B be an inclusion of ﬁnite simplicial sets of dimension ≤ m, let
U ⊆ V , and let ζ : A → F(U ) be a map of simplicial sets.

There exists a cocompact closed subset K ⊆ U whose closure K ⊆ X has Heyting dimension < m − 1 − k,

an open covering {Uα} of U − K, and a collection of commutative diagrams

show that (3) implies (1). So let F be a strongly k-connective sheaf on W and

. The right vertical map is a projective ﬁbration, so that the diagram is homotopy Cartesian
(with respect to the projective model structure). It follows that F′ is also a sheaf on V , which is strongly
(k − m)-connective by Lemma 7.2.4.13. Replacing F by F′, we may reduce to the case m = 0.

The proof now proceeds by induction on k. For our base case, we take k = −n − 1, so that there is no
connectivity assumption on the stack F. We are then free to choose K = V − U (it is clear that K has
dimension ≤ n).

Now suppose that the theorem is known for strongly (k − 1)-connective stacks on any compact open
subset of X; we must show that for any strongly k-connective F on V and any η ∈ F(U ), there exists a
closed subset K ⊆ V − U such that K ⊆ X has Heyting dimension < −k, and a point η′ ∈ F(V − K) whose
restriction to U lies in the same component of F(U ) as η.

Since F is strongly k-connective, we deduce that there exists an open cover {Vα} of some open subset
V − K0, where K0 has dimension < −k in X, together with points ψα ∈ F(Vα). Adjoining the open set U
and the point η if necessary, we may suppose that K0 ∩ U = ∅. Replacing V by V − K0 we may reduce to
the case K0 = ∅.

Since V is compact, we may assume that there exist only ﬁnitely many indices α. Proceeding by induction
on the number of indices, we may reduce to the case where V = U ∪ Vα for some α. Let η′ and ψ′ denote
the images of η and ψ in U ∩ Vα, and form a pullback diagram

.

Again, this diagram is a homotopy pullback, so that F′ is a sheaf on U ∩Vα which is strongly (k−1)-connective
by Lemma 7.2.4.13. According to the inductive hypothesis, there exists a closed subset K ⊂ U ∩ Vα such
that K ⊆ X has dimension < −k + 1, such that the images of ψα and η belong to the same component of
F((U ∩ Vα) − K). Replacing Vα by Since K has dimension < −k + 1 in X, the boundary ∂ K of K has
codimension < −k in X. Let V ′ = Vα − (Vα ∩ K). Since F is a sheaf, we have a homotopy pullback diagram

F(V ′ ∪ U )

F(U )

F(V ′)

/ F(V ′ ∩ U ).

We observe that there is a path joining the images of η and ψα in F(V ′ ∩ U ) = F((U ∩ Vα) − K), so that
η ∈ F(V ′ ∪ U ) whose image in F(U ) lies in the same component as η. We now observe
there is a vertex
that V ′ ∪ U = V − (V ∩ ∂ K), and that V ∩ ∂ K is contained in ∂ K and therefore has Heyting dimension
≤ −k.

Corollary 7.2.4.15. Let π : X → Y be a continuous map between Heyting spaces of ﬁnite dimension.
Suppose that π has the property that for any cocompact closed subset K ⊆ X of dimension ≤ n, π(K) is
contained in a cocompact closed subset of dimension ≤ n. Then the functor π∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) carries
strongly k-connective sheaves on X to strongly k-connective sheaves on Y .

Proof. This is clear from the characterization (2) of Theorem 7.2.4.14.

Corollary 7.2.4.16. Let X be a Heyting space of ﬁnite Heyting dimension, and let F be a strongly k-
connective sheaf on X. Then F(X) is k-connective.

Proof. Apply Corollary 7.2.4.15 in the case where Y is a point.

Corollary 7.2.4.17. Let X be a Heyting space of Heyting dimension ≤ n, and let F be an n-connective
sheaf on X. Then for any compact open U ⊆ X, the map π0 F(X) → π0 F(U ) is surjective. In particular,
Shv(X) has homotopy dimension ≤ n.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. Let F be an n-connective sheaf on X. Then F is strongly 0-
connective; by characterization (2) of Theorem 7.2.4.14, we deduce that F(X) → F(U ) is surjective. The
last claim follows by taking U = ∅.

Remark 7.2.4.18. Let X be a Heyting space of Heyting dimension ≤ n. Then any compact open subset
of X also has Heyting dimension ≤ n. It follows that Shv(X) is locally of homotopy dimension ≤ n, and
therefore hypercomplete by Corollary 7.2.1.12.

Remark 7.2.4.19. It is not necessarily true that a Heyting space X such that Shv(X) has homotopy
dimension ≤ n is itself of Heyting dimension ≤ n. For example, if X is the Zariski spectrum of a discrete
valuation ring (that is, a two point space with a nontrivial topology), then X has homotopy dimension zero
(see Example 7.2.1.3).

In particular, we obtain Grothendieck’s vanishing theorem (see [34] for the original, quite diﬀerent proof):

Corollary 7.2.4.20. Let X be a Noetherian topological space of Krull dimension ≤ n. Then X has coho-
mological dimension ≤ n.

Proof. Combine Proposition 7.2.4.7, Corollary 7.2.4.17, and Corollary 7.2.2.30.

Example 7.2.4.21. Let V be a real algebraic variety (deﬁned over the real numbers, say). Then the lattice
of open subsets of V that can be deﬁned by polynomial equations and inequalities is a Heyting algebra, and
the spectrum of this Heyting algebra is a Heyting space X having dimension at most equal to the dimension
of V . The results of this section therefore apply to X.

More generally, let T be an o-minimal theory (see for example [80]), and let Sn denote the set of complete
n-types of T . We endow Sn with the topology generated by the sets Uφ = {p : φ ∈ p}, where φ ranges over
formula with n free variables such that the openness of the set of points satisfying φ is provable in T . Then
Sn is a Heyting space of Heyting dimension ≤ n.

Remark 7.2.4.22. The methods of this section can be adapted to slightly more general situations, such
as the Nisnevich topology on a Noetherian scheme of ﬁnite Krull dimension. It follows that the ∞-topoi
associated to such sites have (locally) ﬁnite homotopy dimension and are therefore hypercomplete. We will
discuss this matter in more detail in [50].

7.3 The Proper Base Change Theorem

Let

q′

q

p′

Y ′

X

p

/ Y

be a pullback diagram in the category of locally compact Hausdorﬀ spaces. One has a natural isomorphism
of pushforward functors

∗ ≃ p∗q′
∗
from the category of sheaves of sets on Y to the category of sheaves of sets on X ′. This isomorphism induces
a natural transformation

q∗p′

η : q∗p∗ → p′

∗q′∗.

If p (and therefore also p′) is a proper map, then η is an isomorphism: this is a simple version of the classical
proper base change theorem.

The purpose of this section is to generalize the above result, allowing sheaves which take values in the
∞-category S of spaces rather than in the ordinary category of sets. Our generalization can be viewed as a
proper base change theorem for nonabelian cohomology.

We will begin in §7.3.1 by deﬁning the notion of a proper morphism of ∞-topoi. Roughly speaking, a
geometric morphism π∗ : X → Y of ∞-topoi is proper if and only if it satisﬁes the conclusion of the proper
base change theorem. Using this language, our job is to prove that a proper map of topological spaces
p : X → Y induces a proper morphism p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) of ∞-topoi. We will outline the proof of this
result in §7.3.1 by reducing to two special cases: the case where p is a closed embedding, and the case where
Y is a point. We will treat the ﬁrst case in §7.3.2, after introducing a general theory of closed immersions
of ∞-topoi. This allows us to reduce to the case where Y is a point and X a compact Hausdorﬀ space. Our
approach is now in two parts:

(1) In §7.3.3, we will show that we can identify the ∞-category Shv(X ′) = Shv(X ×Y ′) with an ∞-category

of sheaves on X, taking values in Shv(Y ′).

(2) In §7.3.4, we give an analysis of the category of sheaves on a compact Hausdorﬀ space X, taking values
in a general ∞-category C. Combining this analysis with (1), we will deduce the desired base change
theorem.

The techniques used in §7.3.4 to analyze Shv(X) can be applied also in the (easier) setting of coherent
topological spaces, as we explain in §7.3.5. Finally, we conclude in §7.3.6 by reformulating the classical
theory of cell-like maps in the language of ∞-topoi.

7.3.1 Proper Maps of ∞-Topoi

In this section, we introduce the notion of a proper geometric morphism between ∞-topoi. Here we follow
the ideas of [58], and turn the conclusion of the proper base change theorem into a deﬁnition. First, we
require a bit of terminology.

Remark 7.3.1.3. Suppose given a diagram of simplicial sets

M′ P→ M f

→ ∆1,

where both f and f ◦P are Cartesian ﬁbrations. Then we may view M as a correspondence from D = f −1{0}
to C = f −1{1}, associated to some functor q∗ : C → D. Similarly, we may view M′ as a correspondence from
∗ : C′ → D′. The map P determines
D′ = (f ◦ P )−1{0} to C′ = (f ◦ P )−1{1}, associated to some functor q′
functors p′
∗, which
is an equivalence if and only if the map P carries (f ◦ P )-Cartesian edges of M′ to f -Cartesian edges of M.
In this case, we obtain a diagram of homotopy categories

Now suppose that the functors q∗ and q′

respectively. Then the maps f and f ◦ P are coCartesian ﬁbrations. Moreover, the associated push-pull
transformation can be described as follows. Choose an object D′ ∈ D′, and a (f ◦ P )-coCartesian morphism

use of this criterion in §7.3.4.

Deﬁnition 7.3.1.4. Let p∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. We will say that p∗ is proper if
the following condition is satisﬁed:

(∗) For every Cartesian rectangle

Remark 7.3.1.5. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let J be a small ∞-category. The diagonal functor δ : X →
Fun(J, X) preserves all (small) limits and colimits, by Proposition 5.1.2.2, and therefore admits both a left
adjoint δ! and a right adjoint δ∗. If J is ﬁltered, then δ! is left exact (Proposition 5.3.3.3). Consequently, we
have a diagram of geometric morphisms

Now suppose that p∗ : X → Y is a proper geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. We obtain a rectangle

which commutes up to (speciﬁed) homotopy. One can show that this is a Cartesian rectangle in RTop, so
that the square on the left is left adjointable. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we conclude that p∗ commutes with
ﬁltered colimits. Conversely, if p∗ : X → Y is an arbitrary geometric morphism of ∞-topoi which commutes
with colimits indexed by ﬁltered Y-stacks (over each object of Y), then p∗ is proper. To give a proof (or even
a precise formulation) of this statement would require ideas from relative category theory which we will not
develop in this book. We refer the reader to [58], where the analogous result is established for proper maps
between ordinary topoi.

The following properties of the class of proper morphisms follow immediately from Deﬁnition 7.3.1.4:

Proposition 7.3.1.6.

(1) Every equivalence of ∞-topoi is proper.

(2) If p∗ and p′

∗ are equivalent geometric morphisms from an ∞-topos X to another ∞-topos Y, then p∗ is

proper if and only if p′

∗ is proper.

(3) Let

X′

p′
∗

Y′

/ X

p∗

/ Y

be a pullback diagram of ∞-topoi. If p∗ is proper, then so is p′
∗.

(4) Let

X p∗→ Y q∗→ Z

be proper geometric morphisms between ∞-topoi. Then q∗ ◦ p∗ is a proper geometric morphism.

In order to relate Deﬁnition 7.3.1.4 to the classical statement of the proper base change theorem, we
need to understand the relationship between products in the category of topological spaces and products in
the ∞-category of ∞-topoi. A basic result asserts that these are compatible, provided that a certain local
compactness condition is met.

Deﬁnition 7.3.1.7. Let X be a topological space which is not assumed to be Hausdorﬀ. We say that X is
locally compact if, for every open set U ⊆ X and every point x ∈ U , there exists a (not necessarily closed)
compact set K ⊆ U , where K contains an open neighborhood of x.

Example 7.3.1.8. If X is Hausdorﬀ space, then X is locally compact in the sense deﬁned above if and only
if X is locally compact in the usual sense.

Example 7.3.1.9. Let X be a topological space for which the compact open subsets of X form a basis for
the topology of X. Then X is locally compact.

Remark 7.3.1.10. Local compactness of X is precisely the condition which is needed for function spaces
Y X , endowed with the compact-open topology, to represent the functor Z 7→ Hom(Z × X, Y ).

Proposition 7.3.1.11. Let X and Y be topological spaces, and assume that X is locally compact. The
diagram

Shv(X × Y )

Shv(X)

Shv(Y )

/ Shv(∗)

is a pullback square in the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi.

Proof. Let C ⊆ RTop be the full subcategory spanned by the 0-localic ∞-topoi. Since C is a localization of
RTop, the inclusion C ⊆ RTop preserves limits. It therefore suﬃces to prove that

For each topological space M , let U(M ) denote the locale of open subsets of M . Let

U(X)

ψX→ P ψY← U(Y )

be a diagram which exhibits P as a coproduct of U(X) and U(Y ) in the category of locales, and let φ : P →
U(X × Y ) be the induced map. We wish to prove that φ is an isomorphism. This is a standard result in the
theory of locales; we will include a proof for completeness.

Given open subsets U ⊆ X and V ⊆ Y , let U ⊗ V = (ψX U ) ∩ (ψY V ) ∈ P, so that φ(U ⊗ V ) = U × V ∈

U(X × Y ). We deﬁne a map θ : U(X × Y ) → P by the formula

θ(W ) =

U ⊗ V.

[U×V ⊆W
Since every open subset of X × Y can be written as a union of products U × V , where U is an open subset
of X and V an open subset of Y , it is clear that φ ◦ θ : U(X × Y ) → U(X × Y ) is the identity. To complete
the proof, it will suﬃce to show that θ ◦ φ : P → P is the identity. Every element of P can be written as

α Uα ⊗ Vα for Uα ⊆ X and Vα ⊆ Y appropriately chosen. We therefore wish to show that

Let us now return to the subject of the proper base change theorem. We have essentially deﬁned a proper
morphism of ∞-topoi to be one for which the proper base change theorem holds. The challenge, then, is to
produce examples of proper geometric morphisms. The following results will be proven in §7.3.2 and §7.3.4,
respectively:

(1) If p : X → Y is a closed embedding of topological spaces, then p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) is proper.

(2) If X is a compact Hausdorﬀ space, then the global sections functor Γ : Shv(X) → Shv(∗) is proper.

Granting these statements for the moment, we can deduce the main result of this section. First, we must

recall a bit of point-set topology:

Deﬁnition 7.3.1.12. A topological space X is said to be completely regular if every point of X is closed in
X, and for every closed subset Y ⊆ X and every point x ∈ X −Y there is a continuous function f : X → [0, 1]
such that f (x) = 0 and f |Y takes the constant value 1.

Remark 7.3.1.13. A topological space X is completely regular if and only if it is homeomorphic to a
subspace of a compact Hausdorﬀ space X (see [59]).

Deﬁnition 7.3.1.14. A map p : X → Y of (arbitrary) topological spaces is said to be proper if it is
universally closed. In other words, p is proper if and only if for every pullback diagram of topological spaces

the map p′ is closed.

Remark 7.3.1.15. A map p : X → Y of topological spaces is proper if and only if it is closed and each of
the ﬁbers of p is compact (though not necessarily Hausdorﬀ).

Theorem 7.3.1.16. Let p : X → Y be a proper map of topological spaces, where X is completely regular.
Then p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) is proper.

Proof. Let q : X → X be an identiﬁcation of X with a subspace of a compact Hausdorﬀ space X. The map
p admits a factorization

X

q×p
→ X × Y

πY→ Y.

Using Proposition 7.3.1.6, we can reduce to proving that (q × p)∗ and (πY )∗ are proper.

Because q identiﬁes X with a subspace of X, q × p identiﬁes X with a subspace over X × Y . Moreover,

q × p factors as a composition

X → X × X → X × Y

where the ﬁrst map is a closed immersion (since X is Hausdorﬀ) and the second map is closed (since p is
proper). It follows that q × p is a closed immersion, so that (q × p)∗ is a proper geometric morphism by
Proposition 7.3.2.12.

Proposition 7.3.1.11 implies that the geometric morphism (πY )∗ is a pullback of the global sections functor
Γ : Shv(X) → Shv(∗) in the ∞-category RTop. Using Proposition 7.3.1.6, we may reduce to proving that Γ
is proper, which follows from Corollary 7.3.4.11.

Remark 7.3.1.17. The converse to Theorem 7.3.1.16 holds as well (and does not require the assumption
that X is completely regular): if p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) is a proper geometric morphism, then p is a proper
map of topological spaces. This can be proven easily, using the characterization of properness described in
Remark 7.3.1.5.

square and the lower rectangle are (homotopy) Cartesian by Proposition 7.3.1.11, so that the lower left
square is (homotopy) Cartesian as well. It follows that the vertical rectangle is also (homotopy) Cartesian,
as desired.

Remark 7.3.1.19. The classical proper base change theorem, for sheaves of abelian groups on locally
compact topological spaces, is a formal consequence of Corollary 7.3.1.18. We give a brief sketch. The usual
formulation of the proper base change theorem (see, for example, [46]) is equivalent to the statement that if

Let A denote the category whose objects are chain complexes

of abelian groups. Then A admits the structure of a combinatorial model category, in which the weak
equivalences are given by quasi-isomorphisms. Let C = N(A◦) be the underlying ∞-category. For any
topological space Z, one can deﬁne an ∞-category Shv(Z; C) of sheaves on Z with values in C; see §7.3.3.
The homotopy category hShv(Z ; C) is an unbounded version of the derived category D−(Z); in particular, it
contains D−(Z) as a full subcategory. Consequently, we obtain a natural generalization of the proper base
change theorem where boundedness hypotheses have been removed, which asserts that the diagram

7.3.2 Closed Subtopoi

If X is a topological space and U ⊆ X is an open subset, then we may view the closed complement X −U ⊆ X
as a topological space in its own right. Moreover, the inclusion (X − U ) ֒→ X is a proper map of topological
spaces (that is, a closed map whose ﬁbers are compact). The purpose of this section is to present an analogous
construction in the case where X is an ∞-topos.

Lemma 7.3.2.1. Let X be an ∞-topos and ∅ an initial object of X. Then ∅ is (−1)-truncated.

Proof. Let X be an object of X. The space MapX(X, ∅) is contractible if X is an initial object of X, and
empty otherwise (by Lemma 6.1.3.6). In either case, MapX(X, ∅) is (−1)-truncated.

Lemma 7.3.2.2. Let X be an ∞-topos and let f : ∅ → X be a morphism in X, where ∅ is an initial object.
Then f is a monomorphism.

Proof. Apply Lemma 7.3.2.1 to the ∞-topos X/X .

Proposition 7.3.2.3. Let X be an ∞-topos and let U be an object of X. Let SU be the smallest strongly
saturated class of morphisms of X which is stable under pullbacks and contains a morphism f : ∅ → U , where
∅ is an initial object of X. Then SU is topological (in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.2.1.5).

Proof. For each morphism g : X → U in C, form a pullback square

∅′

∅

fY

Y

g

f

/ U.

Let S = {fX}g:X→U and let S be the strongly saturated class of morphisms generated by S. We note that
each fX is a pullback of f , and therefore a monomorphism (by Lemma 7.3.2.2). Let S′ be the collection of
all morphisms h : V → W with the property that for every pullback diagram

V ′

h′

W ′

V

h

/ W

in X, the morphism h belongs to S. Since colimits in X are universal, we deduce that S′ is strongly saturated,
and S ⊆ S′ ⊆ S by construction. Therefore S′ = S, so that S is stable under pullbacks. Since f ∈ S, we
deduce that SU ⊆ S. On the other hand, S ⊆ SU and SU is strongly saturated, so S ⊆ SU . Therefore
SU = S. Since S consists of monomorphisms, we conclude that SU is topological.

In the situation of Proposition 7.3.2.3, we will say that a morphism of X is an equivalence away from U

if it belongs to SU .

Lemma 7.3.2.4. Let X be an ∞-topos containing a pair of objects U, X ∈ X, and let SU denote the class
of morphism in X which are equivalences away from U . The following are equivalent:

(1) The object X is SU -local.

(2) For every map

U → U in X, the space MapX(

U , X) is contractible.

induces an isomorphism

U
e

MapX(

U , X) → MapX(∅′, X) ≃ ∗

in the homotopy category H. This proves that (1) ⇔ (2).

e
Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Taking

U = U , we deduce that there exists a morphism g : U → X.
We will prove that g and idX exhibit U as a product of U with X. As explained in §4.4.1, this is equivalent
to the assertion that for every Z ∈ X, the map
e

MapX(Z, U ) → MapX(Z, U ) × MapX(Z, X)

is an isomorphism in H. If there are no morphisms from Z to U in X, then both sides are empty and the
result is obvious. Otherwise, we may invoke (2) to deduce that MapX(Z, X) is contractible, and the desired
result follows. This completes the proof that (2) ⇒ (3).

Suppose now that (3) is satisﬁed for some morphism g : U → X. For any object Z ∈ X, we have a

homotopy equivalence

MapX(Z, U ) → MapX(Z, U ) × MapX(Z, X).

If MapX(Z, U ) is nonempty, then we may pass to the ﬁber over a point of MapX(Z, U ) to obtain a homotopy
equivalence ∗ → MapX(Z, X), so that MapX(Z, X) is contractible. This proves (2).

If X is an ∞-topos and U ∈ X, then we will say that an object X ∈ X is trivial on U if it satisﬁes the
equivalent conditions of Lemma 7.3.2.4. We let X /U denote the full subcategory of X spanned by the objects
X which are trivial on U . It follows from Proposition 7.3.2.3 that X /U is a topological localization of X,
and in particular X /U is an ∞-topos. We next show that X /U depends only on the support of U .

Lemma 7.3.2.5. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let g : U → V be a morphism in X. Then X /V ⊆ X /U .
Moreover, if g is an eﬀective epimorphism, then X /U = X /V .

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows immediately from Lemma 7.3.2.4. To prove the second, it will suﬃce
to prove that if g is strongly saturated then SV ⊆ SU . Since SU is strongly saturated and stable under
pullbacks, it will suﬃce to prove that SU contains a morphism f : ∅ → V , where ∅ is an initial object of X.

We may view σ as an eﬀective epimorphism from f ′ to f in the ∞-topos X∆1
. Let f• = ˇC(σ) : ∆+ → X∆1
be a ˇCech nerve of σ : f ′ → f . We note that for n ≥ 0, the map fn is a pullback of f ′, and therefore belongs
to SU . Since f• is a colimit diagram, we deduce that f belongs to SU as desired.

U ⊆ X. It follows from Lemma 7.3.2.5 that X /U is independent of the choice of
e

If X is an ∞-topos, we let Sub(1X) denote the partially ordered set of equivalence classes of (−1)-
truncated objects of X. We note that this set is independent of the choice of a ﬁnal object 1X ∈ X, up to
U ∈ X. We deﬁne
canonical isomorphism. Any U ∈ Sub(1X) can be represented by a (−1)-truncated object
X /U = X /
U representing
U , and that for any object X ∈ X, we have X /X = X /U where U ∈ Sub(1X) is the “support” of X (namely,
the equivalence class of the truncation τ−1X).
Deﬁnition 7.3.2.6. If X is an ∞-topos and U ∈ Sub(1X), then we will refer to X /U as the closed subtopos
of X complementary to U . More generally, we will say that a geometric morphism π : Y → X is a closed
immersion if there exists U ∈ Sub(1X) such that π∗ induces an equivalence of ∞-categories from Y to X /U .
Proposition 7.3.2.7. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let U ∈ Sub(1X). Then the closed immersion

Proof. Choose a (−1)-truncated object
(−1)-truncated as an object of X /U if and only if it is (−1)-truncated as an object of X. It therefore suﬃces
V is a (−1)-truncated object of X representing an element V ∈ Sub(1X), then
to prove that if
V is SU -local

V is SU -local, then we have an isomorphism

Corollary 7.3.2.8. Let X be an ∞-topos, and let U, V ∈ Sub(1X). Then SU ⊆ SV if and only if U ⊆ V .

Proof. The “if” direction follows from Lemma 7.3.2.5 and the converse from Proposition 7.3.2.7.

Corollary 7.3.2.9. Let X be a 0-localic ∞-topos, associated to the locale U, and let U ∈ U. Then X /U is
a 0-localic ∞-topos associated to the locale {V ∈ U : U ⊆ V }.

Proof. The ∞-topos X /U is a topological localization of a 0-localic ∞-topos, and therefore also 0-localic
(Proposition 6.4.5.9). The identiﬁcation of the underlying locale follows from Proposition 7.3.2.7.

Corollary 7.3.2.10. Let X be a topological space, U ⊆ X an open subset and Y = X − U . The inclusion of
Y in X induces a closed immersion of ∞-topoi Shv(Y ) → Shv(X) and an equivalence Shv(Y ) → Shv(X)/U .

Lemma 7.3.2.11. Let X and Y be ∞-topoi, and let U ∈ Y be an object. The map

Fun∗(X, Y /U ) → Fun∗(X, Y)

identiﬁes Fun∗(X, Y /U ) with the full subcategory of Fun∗(X, Y) spanned by those geometric morphisms π∗ :
X → Y such that π∗U is an initial object of X (here π∗ denotes a left adjoint to π∗).
Proof. Let π∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism. Using the adjointness of π∗ and π∗, it is easy to see that
π∗X is SU -local if and onyl if X is π∗(SU )-local. In particular, π∗ factors through Y /U if and only if π∗(SU )
consists of equivalences in X. Choosing f ∈ SU of the form f : ∅ → U , where ∅ is an initial object of X,
we deduce that π∗f is an equivalence so that π∗U ≃ π∗∅ is an initial object of X. Conversely, suppose that
π∗U is an initial object of X. Then π∗f is a morphism between two initial objects of X, and therefore an
equivalence. Since π∗ is left exact and colimit-preserving, the collection of all morphisms g such that π∗g
is an equivalence is strongly saturated, stable under pullbacks, and contains f ; it therefore contains SU , so
that π∗ factors through Y /U as desired.

599

Proposition 7.3.2.12. Let π∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi, and let π∗ : Sub(1X) →
Sub(1Y) denote the induced map of partially ordered sets. Let U ∈ Sub(1X). There is a commutative
diagram

X /π∗U

π∗|(X /π∗U)

X

π∗

Y /U

/ Y

of ∞-topoi and geometric morphisms, where the vertical maps are given by the natural inclusions. This
diagram is left adjointable, and exhibits X /(π∗U ) as a ﬁber product of X and Y /U over Y in the ∞-category
RTop.

Proof. Let π∗ denote a left adjoint to π∗. Our ﬁrst step is to show that the upper horizontal map π∗|(X /π∗U )
is well-deﬁned. In other words, we must show that if X ∈ X is trivial on π∗U , then π∗X ∈ Y is trivial on
U . Suppose that Y ∈ Y has support contained in U ; we must show that MapY(Y, π∗X) is contractible. But
this space is homotopy equivalent to MapX(π∗Y, X) ≃ ∗, since π∗Y has support contained in π∗U and X is
trivial on π∗U .

We note also that π∗ carries Y /U into X /π∗U . This follows immediately from characterization (3) of
Lemma 7.3.2.4, since π∗ is left exact. Therefore π∗| Y /U is a left adjoint of π∗| X /π∗U . From the fact that
π∗ is left-exact we easily deduce that π∗| Y /U is left exact. It follows that π∗| X /π∗U has a left-exact left
adjoint, and is therefore a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. Moreover, the diagram

X /π∗U

π∗| Y /Y

X

π∗

Y /U

Y

is (strictly) commutative, which proves that the diagram of pushforward functors is left adjointable.

We now claim that the diagram

X /π∗U

π∗| X /π∗U

X

Y /U

/ Y

is a pullback diagram of ∞-topoi. For every pair of ∞-topoi A and B, let [A, B] denote the largest Kan
complex contained in Fun∗(A, B). According to Theorem 4.2.4.1, it will suﬃce to show that for any ∞-topos
Z, the associated diagram of Kan complexes

[Z, X /π∗U ]

[Z, Y /U ]

[Z, X]

/ [Z, Y]

is homotopy Cartesian. Lemma 7.3.2.11 implies that the vertical maps are inclusions of full simplicial subsets.
It therefore suﬃces to show that if φ∗ : Z → Y is a geometric morphism such that π∗ ◦ φ∗ factors through
Y /U , then φ∗ factors through X /π∗U . This follows immediately from the characterization given in Lemma
7.3.2.11.

7.3.3 Products of ∞-Topoi

In §6.3.4, we showed that the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi admits all (small) limits. Unfortunately, the
construction of general limits was rather inexplicit. Our goal in this section is to give a very concrete
description of the product of two ∞-topoi, at least in a special case.

Deﬁnition 7.3.3.1. Let X be a topological space, and C an ∞-category. We let U(X) denote the collection
of all open subsets of X, partially ordered by inclusion. A presheaf on X with values in C is a functor
U(X)op → C.

Let F : U(X)op → C be a presheaf on X with values in C. We will say that F is a sheaf with values in C

if, for every U ⊆ X and every covering sieve U(X)(0)

/U ⊆ U(X)/U , the composition

N(U(X)(0)

/U )⊲ ⊆ N(U(X)/U )⊲ → N(U(X))

F
→ Cop

is a colimit diagram.

We let P(X; C) denote the ∞-category Fun(U(X)op, C) consisting of all presheaves on X with values in

C, and Shv(X; C) the full subcategory of P(X; C) spanned by the sheaves on X with values in C.

Remark 7.3.3.2. We can phrase the sheaf condition informally as follows: a C-valued presheaf F on a
topological space X is a sheaf if, for every open subset U ⊆ X and every covering sieve {Uα ⊆ U }, the
natural map F(U ) → lim
←−α

F(Uα) is an equivalence in C.

Remark 7.3.3.3. If X is a topological space, then Shv(X) = Shv(X, S), where S denotes the ∞-category
of spaces.

Lemma 7.3.3.4. Let C, D, and E be ∞-categories which admit ﬁnite limits, let C0 ⊆ C and D0 ⊆ D be
the full subcategories of C and D consisting of ﬁnal objects. Let F : C × D → E be a functor. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(1) The functor F preserves ﬁnite limits.

(2) The functors F | C0 × D and F | C × D0 preserve ﬁnite limits, and for every pair of morphisms C → 1C,

D → 1D where 1C ∈ C and 1D ∈ D are ﬁnal objects, the associated diagram

exhibits F (C, D) as a product of F (1C, D) and F (C, 1D) in E.

F (1C, D) ← F (C, D) → F (C, 1D)

(3) The functors F | C0 × D and F | C × D0 preserve ﬁnite limits, and F is a right Kan extension of the

restriction

F 0 = F |(C × D0)

(C0 × D).

aC0 × D0

601

(cid:15)

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) is obvious. To see that (2) ⇒ (1), we choose ﬁnal objects 1C ∈ C, 1D ∈ D,
and natural transformations α : idC → 1C, β : idD → 1D (where X denotes the constant functor with value
X). Let FC : C → E denote the composition

C ≃ C ×{1D} ⊆ C × D F→ E,

and deﬁne FD similarly. Then α and β induce natural transformations

FC ◦ πC ← F → FD ◦ πD.

Assumption (2) implies that the functors FC, FD preserve ﬁnite limits, and that the above diagram exhibits
F as a product of FC ◦ πC with FD ◦ πD in the ∞-category EC × D. We now apply Lemma 5.5.2.3 to deduce
that F preserves ﬁnite limits as well.

We now show that (2) ⇔ (3). Assume that F | C0 × D and F | C × D0 preserve ﬁnite limits, so that in
particular F | C0 × D0 takes values in the full subcategory E0 ⊆ E spanned by the ﬁnal objects. Fix morphisms
u : C → 1C, v : D → 1D, where 1C ∈ C and 1D ∈ D are ﬁnal obejcts. We will show that the diagram

F (1C, D) ← F (C, D) → F (C, 1D)

exhibits F (C, D) as a product of F (1C, D) and F (C, 1D) if and only if F is a right Kan extension of F 0 at
(C, D).

The morphisms u and v determine a map u × v : ∆1 × ∆1 → C × D, which we may identify with a map

w : Λ2

2 → ((C0 × D)

(C × D0))(C,D)/.

aC0 × D0

Using Theorem 4.1.3.1, it is easy to see that wop is coﬁnal. Consequently, F is a right Kan extension of F 0
at (C, D) if and only if the diagram

F (C, D)

F (C, 1D)

F (1C, D)

/ F (1C, 1D)

is a pullback square. Since F (1C, 1D) is a ﬁnal object of E, this is equivalent to assertion (2).

Lemma 7.3.3.5. Let C and D be small ∞-categories which admit ﬁnite limits, and let 1C ∈ C, 1D ∈ D be
ﬁnal objects, and let X be an ∞-topos. The projections

P(C ×{1D})

p∗← P(C × D)

q∗→ P({1C} × D)

induce a categorical equivalence

Fun∗(X, P(C × D)) → Fun∗(X, P(C)) × Fun∗(X, P(D)).

In particular, P(C × D) is a product of P(C) with P(D) in the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi.

Proof. For every ∞-category Y which admits ﬁnite limits, let [Y, X] denote the full subcategory of Fun(Y, X)
spanned by the left exact functors Y → X. If Y is an ∞-topos, we let [Y, X]0 denote the full subcategory of
[Y, X] spanned by the colimit-preserving left exact functors Y → X. In view of Proposition 5.2.6.2 and Remark
5.2.6.4, it will suﬃce to prove that composition with the left adjoints to p∗ and q∗ induces an equivalence of
∞-categories

[P(C × D), X]0 → [P(C), X]0 × [P(D), X]0.

Applying Proposition 6.2.3.20, we may reduce to the problem of showing that the map

[C × D, X] → [C, X] × [D, X]

is an equivalence of ∞-categories.

Let C0 ⊆ C and D0 ⊆ D denote the full subcategories consisting of ﬁnal objects of C and D, respectively.
It will therefore suﬃce to prove that the

Proposition 1.2.12.9 implies that C0 and D0 are contractible.
restriction map

φ : [C × D, X] → [C × D0, X] ×[C0 × D0,X] [C0 × D, X]
is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets. This follows immediately from Lemma 7.3.3.4 and Proposition 4.3.2.15.

Notation 7.3.3.6. Let X be an ∞-topos, and p∗ : S → X a geometric morphism (essentially unique in view
of Proposition 6.3.4.1). Let πX : X × S → X and πS : X × S → S denote the projection functors. Let ⊗ be a
product of πX with p∗ ◦ πS in the ∞-category of functors from X × S to X. Then ⊗ is uniquely deﬁned up
to equivalence, and we have natural transformations

X ← X ⊗ S → p∗S

which exhibit X ⊗ S as product of X with p∗S for all X ∈ X, S ∈ S. We observe that ⊗ preserves colimits
separately in each variable.

If C is a small ∞-category, we let ⊗C denote the composition

P(C; X) × P(C) ≃ P(C; X × S) ◦⊗→ P(C, X).

We observe that if F ∈ P(C; X) and G ∈ P(C), then F ⊗C G can be identiﬁed with a product of F with p∗ ◦ G
in P(C; X).

Lemma 7.3.3.7. Let C be a small ∞-category, X an ∞-topos. Let g : X → S a functor corepresented by an
object X ∈ X, and G : P(C; X) → P(C) the induced functor. Let X ∈ P(C; X) denote the constant functor
with the value X. Then the functor

F = X ⊗C idP(C) .

is a left adjoint to G.
Proof. Since adjoints and ⊗C can both be computed pointwise on C, it suﬃces to treat the case where C = ∆0.
In this case, we deduce the existence of a left adjoint F ′ to G using Corollary 5.5.2.9 (the accessibility of G
follows from the fact that X is κ-compact for suﬃciently large κ, since X is accessible). Now F and F ′ are
both colimit-preserving functors S → X. In virtue of Theorem 5.1.5.6, to prove that F and F ′ are equivalent,
it will suﬃce to show that the objects F (∗), F ′(∗) ∈ X are equivalent. In other words, we must prove that
F ′(∗) ≃ X. By adjointness, we have natural isomorphisms

MapX(F ′(∗), Y ) ≃ MapH(∗, G(Y )) ≃ MapX(X, Y )

in H for each Y ∈ X, so that F ′(∗) and X corepresent the same functor on the homotopy category hX, and
are therefore equivalent by Yoneda’s lemma.

Lemma 7.3.3.8. Let C be a small ∞-category which admits ﬁnite limits and contains a ﬁnal object 1C, let X
and Y be ∞-topoi, and let p∗ : X → S be a geometric morphism (essentially unique, in virtue of Proposition
6.3.4.1). Then the maps

induce equivalences of ∞-categories

P(C)

P∗← P(C; X)

e1C→ X

Fun∗(Y, P(C; X)) → Fun∗(Y, X) × Fun∗(Y, P(C)).

In particular, P(C; X) is a product of P(C) and X in the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi. Here e1C denote the
evaluation map at the object 1C ∈ C, and P∗ : P(C; X) → P(C) is given by composition with p∗.

603

Proof. According to Proposition 6.1.5.3, we may assume without loss of generality that there exists a small ∞-
category D such that X is the essential image of an accessible left exact localization functor L : P(D) → P(D),
and that p∗ is given by evaluation at a ﬁnal object 1D ∈ D. We have a commutative diagram

Fun∗(Y, P(C; X))

Fun∗(Y, P(C)) × Fun∗(Y, X)

Fun∗(Y, P(C × D))

/ Fun∗(Y, P(C)) × Fun∗(Y, P(D))

where the vertical arrows are inclusions of full subcategories, and the bottom arrow is an equivalence of ∞-
categories by Lemma 7.3.3.5. Consequently, it will suﬃce to show that if q∗ : Y → P(C × D) is a geometric
morphism with the property that the composition

r∗ : Y → P(C × D) → P(D)

factors through X, then q∗ factors through P(C; X).

Let Y ∈ Y and C ∈ C; we wish to show that q∗(Y )(C) ∈ X. It will suﬃce to show that if s : D → D′ is a
morphism in P(D) such that L(s) is an equivalence in X, then q∗(Y )(C) is s-local. Let F : P(D) → P(C × D)
be a left adjoint to the functor given by evaluation at C. We have a commutative diagram

MapP(D)(D′, q∗(Y )(C))

MapY(q∗F (D′), Y )

MapP(D)(D, q∗(Y )(C))

/ MapY(q∗F (D), Y )

where the horizontal arrows are homotopy equivalences. Consequently, to prove that the left vertical map is
an equivalence, it will suﬃce to prove that q∗F (s) is an equivalence in Y. According to Lemma 7.3.3.7, the
functor F can be identiﬁed with a product of a left adjoint r∗ to the projection r∗ : P(C × D) → P(D) with a
constant functor. Since q∗ preserves ﬁnite products, it will suﬃce to show that (q∗ ◦ r∗)(s) is an equivalence
in Y. This follows immediately from our assumption that r∗ ◦ q∗ : Y → P(D) factors through X.

The main result of this section is the following:

Theorem 7.3.3.9. Let X be a topological space, X an ∞-topos, and π∗ : X → S a geometric morphism
(which is essentially unique, by virtue of Proposition 6.3.4.1). Then Shv(X; X) is an ∞-topos, and the
diagram

X Γ← Shv(X; X)

π∗→ Shv(X)

exhibits Shv(X; X) as a product of Shv(X) and X in the ∞-category RTop of ∞-topoi. Here Γ denotes the
global sections functor, given by evaluation at X ∈ U(X).

Proof. We ﬁrst show that Shv(X; X) is an ∞-topos. Let P(X; X) be the ∞-category Fun(N(U(X))op, X) of
X-valued presheaves on X. For each object Y ∈ X, choose a morphism eY : ∅X → Y in X, whose source is
an initial object of X. For each sieve V on X, let χY

V : U(X)op → X be the composition

so that

U(X)op → ∆1 eY→ X,

χY

V (U )

if U ∈ V
Y
∅X if U /∈ V .

(

so that we have a natural map χY
V = {V ⊆ U }. Let S be the set of all morphisms f Y

V → χY

V′ if V ⊆ V′. For each open subset U ⊆ X, let χY

V , where
U , where V is a sieve covering U , and let S

U = χY

be the strongly saturated class of morphisms generated by X. We ﬁrst claim that S is setwise generated.
To see this, we observe that the passage from Y to f Y
V is a colimit-preserving functor of Y , so it suﬃces to
consider a set of objects Y ∈ X which generates X under colimits.

We next claim that S is topological, in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.2.1.5. By a standard argument, it will
suﬃce to show that there is a class of objects Fα ∈ P(X; X) which generates P(X; X) under colimits, such
that for every pullback diagram

F ′

f ′

Fα

the morphism f ′ belongs to S. We observe that if X is a left exact localization of P(D), then P(X; X) is
a left exact localization of P(U(X) × D) and is therefore generated under colimits by the Yoneda image of
U(X) × D. In other words, it will suﬃce to consider Fα of the form χY ′
U ′ , where Y ′ ∈ X and U ′ ⊆ X. If Y ′
is an initial object of X, then g is an equivalence and there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, the existence of
the lower horizontal map implies that U ′ ⊆ U . Let V′ = {V ∈ V : V ⊆ U ′}; then it is easy to see that f ′ is
equivalent to χY ′

V′ , and therefore belongs to S.

We next claim that Shv(X; X) consists precisely of the S-local objects of P(X; X). To see this, let Y ∈ X
be an arbitrary object, and consider the functor GY : X → S corepresented by Y . It follows from Proposition
5.1.3.2 that an arbitrary F ∈ P(X; X) is a X-valued sheaf on X if and only if, for each Y ∈ X, the composition
GY ◦ F ∈ P(X) belongs to Shv(X). This is equivalent to the assertion that, for every sieve V which covers
U ⊆ X, the presheaf GY ◦ F is sV-local, where sV : χV → χU is the associated monomorphism of presheaves.
Let G∗
Y (sV)-local. We now apply
Lemma 7.3.3.7 to identify G∗

Y denote a left adjoint to GY ; then GY ◦ F is sV-local if and only if F is G∗
Y (sV) with f Y
V .

We now have an identiﬁcation Shv(X; X) ≃ S

−1 P(X; X), so that Shv(X; X) is a topological localization
of P(X; X) and in particular an ∞-topos. We now consider an arbitrary ∞-topos Y. We have a commutative
diagram

Fun∗(Y, Shv(X; X))

Fun∗(Y, Shv(X)) × Fun∗(Y; X)

Fun∗(Y, P(X; X))

/ Fun∗(Y, P(X)) × Fun∗(Y, X),

where the vertical arrows are inclusions of full subcategories and the lower horizontal arrow is an equivalence
by Lemma 7.3.3.8. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the upper horizontal arrow is also
an equivalence. In other words, we must show that if g∗ : Y → P(X; X) is a geometric morphism with the
property that the composition

Y g∗→ P(X; X)

h∗→ P(X)

factors through Shv(X), then g∗ factors through Shv(X; X). Let g∗ and h∗ denote left adjoints to g∗ and h∗,
respectively. It will suﬃce to show that for every morphism f Y
V is an equivalence in
Y. We now observe that f Y
V is an
equivalence in Y. We have an equivalence f 1X
V ≃ h∗sV, where sV is the monomorphism in P(X) associated to
the sieve V. The composition (g∗ ◦ h∗)(sV) is an equivalence because h∗ ◦ g∗ factors through Shv(X), which
consists of sV-local objects of P(X).

V ∈ S, the pullback g∗f Y
V ; since g∗ is left exact, it will suﬃce to show that g∗f 1X

V is a pullback of f 1X

Remark 7.3.3.10. It is not diﬃcult to extend the proof of Theorem 7.3.3.9 to the case where Shv(X) is
replaced by an arbitrary ∞-topos Y.
In this case, one must replace Shv(X; X) by the ∞-category of all
limit-preserving functors Yop → X. Using these ideas, one can construct the ﬁber product

X ×Z Y

in RTop where Z = S is the ﬁnal object in RTop. To give a construction which works in general, one needs
to repeat all of the above arguments in a relative setting over the ∞-topos Z. We will not pursue the subject
any further in this book.

7.3.4 Sheaves on Locally Compact Spaces

By deﬁnition, a sheaf of sets F on a topological space X is determined by the sets F(U ) as U ranges over the
open subsets of X. If X is a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space, then there is an alternative collection of data
which determines X: the values F(K), where K ranges over the compact subsets of X. Here F(K) denotes
F(U ) taken over all open neighborhoods of K (or, equivalently, the collection of
the direct limit lim
global sections of the restriction F |K). The goal of this section is to prove a generalization of this result,
where the sheaf F is allowed to take values in a more general ∞-category C.

−→K⊆U

Deﬁnition 7.3.4.1. Let X be a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space. We let K(X) denote the collection of all
compact subsets of X. If K, K ′ ⊆ X, we write K ⋐ K ′ if there exists an open subset U ⊆ X such that
K ⊆ U ⊆ K ′. If K ∈ K(X), we let KK⋐(X) = {K ′ ∈ K(X) : K ⋐ K ′}.

Let F : N(K(X))op → C be a presheaf on N(K(X)) (here K(X) is viewed as a partially ordered set with
respect to inclusion) with values in C. We will say that F is a K-sheaf if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The object F(∅) ∈ C is ﬁnal.

(2) For every pair K, K ′ ∈ K(X), the associated diagram

F(K ∪ K ′)

F(K)

F(K ′)

/ F(K ∩ K ′)

is a pullback square in C.

(3) For each K ∈ K(X), the restriction of F exhibits F(K) as a colimit of F | N(KK⋐(X))op.

We let ShvK(X; C) denote the full subcategory of Fun(N(K(X))op, C) spanned by the K-sheaves. In the

case where C = S, we will write ShvK(X) instead of ShvK(X; C).

Deﬁnition 7.3.4.2. Let C be a presentable ∞-category. We will say that ﬁltered colimits in C are left exact
if the following condition is satisﬁed: for every small ﬁltered ∞-category I, the colimit functor Fun(I, C) → C
is left exact.

Example 7.3.4.3. A Grothendieck abelian category is an abelian category A whose nerve N(A) is a pre-
sentable ∞-category with left exact ﬁltered colimits, in the sense of Deﬁnition 7.3.4.2. We refer the reader
to [34] for further discussion.

Example 7.3.4.4. Filtered colimits are left exact in the ∞-category S of spaces; this follows immediately
from Proposition 5.3.3.3. It follows that ﬁltered colimits in τ≤n S are left exact for each n ≥ −2, since the
full subcategory τ≤n S ⊆ S is stable under ﬁltered colimits and ﬁnite limits (in fact, under all limits).

Example 7.3.4.5. Let C be a presentable ∞-category in which ﬁltered colimits are left exact, and let X
be an arbitrary simplicial set. Then ﬁltered colimits are left exact in Fun(X, C). This follows immediately
from Proposition 5.1.2.2, which asserts that the relevant limits and colimits can be computed pointwise.

Example 7.3.4.6. Let C be a presentable ∞-category in which ﬁltered colimits are left exact, and let D ⊆ C
be the essential image of an (accessible) left exact localization functor L. Then ﬁltered colimits in D are left

606

exact. To prove this, we consider an arbitrary ﬁltered ∞-category I, and observe that the colimit functor
lim
−→

: Fun(I, D) → D is equivalent to the composition

Fun(I, D) ⊆ Fun(I, C) → C L→ D,

where the second arrow is given by the colimit functor lim
−→

Fun(I, C) → C.

Example 7.3.4.7. Let X be an n-topos, 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. Then ﬁltered colimits in X are left exact. This follows
immediately from Examples 7.3.4.4, 7.3.4.5, and 7.3.4.6.

Our goal is to prove that if X is a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space and C is a presentable ∞-category,
then the ∞-categories Shv(X) and ShvK(X) are equivalent. As a ﬁrst step, we prove that a K-sheaf on X
is determined “locally”.

Lemma 7.3.4.8. Let X be a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space and C a presentable ∞-category in which
ﬁltered colimits are left exact. Let W be a collection of open subsets of X which covers X, and let KW(X) =
{K ∈ K(X) : (∃W ∈ W)[K ⊆ W ]}. Suppose that F ∈ ShvK(X; C). Then F is a right Kan extension of
F | N(KW(X))op.

Proof. Let us say that an open covering W of a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space X is good if it satisﬁes the
conclusion of the Lemma. Note that W is a good covering of X if and only if, for every compact subset
K ⊆ X, the open sets {K ∩ W : W ∈ W} form a good covering of K. We wish to prove that every covering
W of a locally compact topological space X is good. In virtue of the preceding remarks, we can reduce to
the case where X is compact, and thereby assume that W has a ﬁnite subcover.

We will prove, by induction on n ≥ 0, that if W is collection of open subsets of a locally compact Hausdorﬀ
space X such that there exist W1, . . . , Wn ∈ W with W1 ∪ . . . ∪ Wn = X, then W is a good covering of X. If
n = 0, then X = ∅. In this case, we must prove that F(∅) is ﬁnal, which is part of the deﬁnition of K-sheaf.
Suppose that W ⊆ W′ are coverings of X, and that for every W ′ ∈ W′ the induced covering {W ∩ W ′ :
W ∈ W} is a good covering of W ′. It then follows from Proposition 4.3.2.8 that W′ is a good covering of X
if and only if W is a good covering of X.

Now suppose n > 0. Let V = W2 ∪ . . . ∪ Wn, and let W′ = W ∪{V }. Using the above remark and the
inductive hypothesis, it will suﬃce to show that W′ is a good covering of X. Now W′ contains a pair of
open sets W1 and V which cover X. We thereby reduce to the case n = 2; using the above remark we can
furthermore suppose that W = {W1, W2}.

We now wish to show that for every compact K ⊆ X, F exhibits F(K) as the limit of F | N(KW(X))op.
Let P be the collection of all pairs K1, K2 ∈ K(X) such that K1 ⊆ W1, K2 ⊆ W2, and K1 ∪ K2 = K. We
observe that P is a ﬁltered when ordered by inclusion. For α = (K1, K2) ∈ P , let Kα = {K ′ ∈ K(X) :
(K ′ ⊆ K1) ∨ (K ′ ⊆ K2)}. We note that KW(X) =
α∈P Kα. Moreover, Theorem 4.1.3.1 implies that for
α = (K1, K2) ∈ P , the inclusion N{K1, K2, K1 ∩ K2} ⊆ N(Kα) is coﬁnal. Since F is a K-sheaf, we deduce
S
that F exhibits F(K) as a limit of the diagram F | N(Kα)op for each α ∈ P . Using Proposition 4.2.3.4,
we deduce that F(K) is a limit of F | N(KW(X))op if and only if F(K) is a limit of the constant diagram
N(P )op → S taking the value F(K). This is clear, since P is ﬁltered so that the map N(P ) → ∆0 is coﬁnal
by Theorem 4.1.3.1.

Theorem 7.3.4.9. Let X be a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space and C a presentable ∞-category in which
ﬁltered colimits are left exact. Let F : N(K(X) ∪ U(X))op → C be a presheaf on the partially ordered set
K(X) ∪ U(X). The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The presheaf FK = F | N(K(X))op is a K-sheaf and F is a right Kan extension of FK.

(2) The presheaf FU = F | N(U(X))op is a sheaf and F is a left Kan extension of FU.

607

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. We ﬁrst prove that F is a left Kan extension of FU. Let K be a
compact subset of X, and let UK⊆(X) = {U ∈ U(X) : K ⊆ U }. Consider the diagram

N(U(X) ∪ K(X))op

We wish to prove that ψ is a colimit diagram. Since FK is a K-sheaf, we deduce that ψ′ is a colimit
diagram. It therefore suﬃces to check that p and p′ are coﬁnal. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it suﬃces to
show that for every Y ∈ UK⊆(X) ∪ KK⋐(X), the partially ordered sets {K ′ ∈ K(X) : K ⋐ K ′ ⊆ Y } and
{U ∈ U(X) : K ⊆ U ⊆ Y } have contractible nerves. We now observe that both of these partially ordered
sets is ﬁltered, since they are nonempty and stable under ﬁnite unions.

We now show that FU is a sheaf. Let U be an open subset of X and let W be a sieve which covers U .
Let K⊆U (X) = {K ∈ K(X) : K ⊆ U } and let KW(X) = {K ∈ K(X) : (∃W ∈ W)[K ⊆ W ]}. We wish to
prove that the diagram

N(Wop)⊳ → N(U(X))op FU→ S

is a limit. Using Theorem 4.1.3.1, we deduce that the inclusion N(W) ⊆ N(W ∪ KW(X)) is coﬁnal.
It
therefore suﬃces to prove that F |(W ∪ KW(X) ∪ {U })op is a right Kan extension of F |(W ∪ KW(X))op.
Since F |(W ∪ KW(X))op is a right Kan extension of F | KW(X)op by assumption, it suﬃces to prove that
F |(W ∪ KW(X) ∪ {U })op is a right Kan extension of F | KW(X)op. This is clear at every object distinct from
U ; it will therefore suﬃce to prove that F |(KW(X) ∪ {U })op is a right Kan extension of F | KW(X)op.

By assumption, F | N(K⊆U (X) ∪ {U })op is a right Kan extension of F | N(K⊆U (X))op and Lemma 7.3.4.8
implies that F | N(K⊆U (X))op is a right Kan extension of F | N(KW(X))op. Invoking Proposition 4.3.2.8, we
deduce that F | N(KW(X) ∪ {U })op is a right Kan extension of F | N(KW(X))op. This shows that FU is a
sheaf, and completes the proof that (1) ⇒ (2).

Now suppose that F satisﬁes (2). We ﬁrst verify that FK is a K-sheaf. The space FK(∅) = FU(∅) is
contractible because FU is a sheaf (and because the empty sieve is a covering sieve on ∅ ⊆ X). Suppose next
that K and K ′ are compact subsets of X. We wish to prove that the diagram

F(K ∪ K ′)

F(K)

F(K ′)

/ F(K ∩ K ′)

is a pullback in S. Let us denote this diagram by σ : ∆1 × ∆1 → S. Let P be the set of all pairs U, U ′ ∈ U(X)
such that K ⊆ U and K ′ ⊆ U ′. The functor F induces a map σP : N(P op)⊲ → S∆1×∆1
, which carries each
pair (U, U ′) to the diagram

F(U ∪ U ′)

F(U )

F(U ′)

and carries the cone point to σ. Since FU is a sheaf, each σP (U, U ′) is a pullback diagram in C. Since ﬁltered
colimits in C are left exact, it will suﬃce to show that σP is a colimit diagram. By Proposition 5.1.2.2, it
suﬃces to show that each of the four maps

N(P op)⊲ → S

, given by evaluating σP at the four vertices of ∆1 × ∆1, is a colimit diagram. We will treat the case of the
ﬁnal vertex; the other cases are handled in the same way. Let Q = {U ∈ U(X) : K ∩ K ′ ⊆ U }. T We are
given a map g : N(P op)⊲ → S which admits a factorization

N(P op)⊲ g′′

→ N(Qop)⊲ g′

→ N(U(X) ∪ K(X))op F

→ C .

Since F is a left Kan extension of FU, the diagram F ◦g′′ is a colimit. It therefore suﬃces to show that g′′
induces a coﬁnal map N(P )op → N(Q)op. Using Theorem 4.1.3.1, it suﬃces to prove that for every U ′′ ∈ Q,
the partially ordered set PU ′′ = {(U, U ′) ∈ P : U ∩ U ′ ⊆ U ′′} has contractible nerve. It now suﬃces to
observe that P op

U ′′ is ﬁltered (since PU ′′ is nonempty and stable under intersections).

We next show that for any compact subset K ⊆ X, the map

N(KK⋐(X)op)⊲ → N(K(X) ∪ U(X))op F
is a colimit diagram. Let V = U(X) ∪ KK⋐(X), and let V′ = V ∪{K}. It follows from Proposition 4.3.2.8
that F | N(V)op and F | N(V′)op are left Kan extensions of F | N(U(X))op, so that F | N(V′)op is a left Kan
extension of F | N(V)op. Therefore the diagram

→ C

(N(KK⋐(X) ∪ {U ∈ U(X) : K ⊆ U })op)⊲ → N(K(X) ∪ U(X))op F

→ C

is a colimit. It therefore suﬃces to show that the inclusion

N(KK⋐(X))op ⊆ N(KK⋐(X) ∪ {U ∈ U(X) : K ⊆ U })op
is coﬁnal. Using Theorem 4.1.3.1, we are reduced to showing that if Y ∈ KK⋐(X) ∪ {U ∈ U(X) : K ⊆ U },
then the nerve of the partially ordered set R = {K ′ ∈ K(X) : K ⋐ K ′ ⊂ Y } is weakly contractible. It now
suﬃces to observe that Rop is ﬁltered, since R is nonempty and stable under intersections. This completes
the proof that FK is a K-sheaf.

We now show that F is a right Kan extension of FK. Let U be an open subset of X, and for V ∈ U(X)
write V ⋐ U if the closure V is compact and contained in U . Let U⋐U (X) = {V ∈ U(X) : V ⋐ U }, and
consider the diagram

We wish to prove that φ′ is a limit diagram. Since the sieve U⋐U (X) covers U and FU is a sheaf, we conclude
that φ is a limit diagram. It therefore suﬃces to prove that f op and (f ′)op are coﬁnal maps of simplicial
sets. According to Theorem 4.1.3.1, it suﬃces to prove that if Y ∈ K⊆U (X) ∪ U⋐U (X), then the partially
ordered sets {V ∈ U(X) : Y ⊆ V ⋐ U } and {K ∈ K(X) : Y ⊆ K ⊆ U } have weakly contractible nerves. We
now observe that both of these partially ordered sets are ﬁltered (since they are nonempty and stable under
unions). This completes the proof that F is a right Kan extension of FK.

Corollary 7.3.4.11. Let X be a compact Hausdorﬀ space. Then the global sections functor Γ : Shv(X) → S
is a proper morphism of ∞-topoi.

Proof. The existence of ﬁber products Shv(X) ×S Y in RTop follows from Theorem 7.3.3.9. It will therefore
suﬃce to prove that for any (homotopy) Cartesian rectangle

Shv(X)

the square on the left is left adjointable. Using Theorem 7.3.3.9, we can identify the square on the left with

Shv(X; Y′′)

Shv(X; Y′)

Y′′

f∗

/ Y′,

where the vertical morphisms are given by taking global sections.

Choose a correspondence M from Y′ to Y′′ which is associated to the functor f∗. Since f∗ admits a
left adjoint f ∗, the projection M → ∆1 is both a Cartesian ﬁbration and a coCartesian ﬁbration. For
every simplicial set K, let MK = Fun(K, M) ×Fun(K,∆1) ∆1. Then MK determines a correspondence from
Fun(K, Y′) to Fun(K, Y′′). Using Proposition 3.1.2.1, we conclude that MK → ∆1 is both a Cartesian and
a coCartesian ﬁbration, and that it is associated to the functors given by composition with f∗ and f ∗.

Before proceeding further, let us adopt the following convention for the remainder of the proof: given
a simplicial set Z with a map q : Z → ∆1, we will say that an edge of Z is Cartesian or coCartesian if
it is q-Cartesian or q-coCartesian, respectively. The map q to which we are referring should be clear from
context.

Let MU denote the full subcategory of MN(U(X))op whose objects correspond to sheaves on X (with values
in either Y′ or Y′′). Since f∗ preserves limits, composition with f∗ carries Shv(X; Y′′) into Shv(X; Y′). We
conclude that the projection MU → ∆1 is a Cartesian ﬁbration, and that the inclusion MU ⊆ MN(U(X))op
preserves Cartesian edges.

Similarly, we deﬁne MK to be the full subcategory of MN(K(X))op whose objects correspond to K-sheaves
on X (with values in either Y′ or Y′′). Since f ∗ preserves ﬁnite limits and ﬁltered colimits, composition with
f ∗ carries ShvK(X; Y′) into ShvK(X; Y′′). It follows that the projection MK → ∆1 is a coCartesian ﬁbration,
and that the inclusion MK ⊆ MN(U(X))op preserves coCartesian edges.

Now let M′

KU = MN(K(X)∪U(X))op and let MKU be the full subcategory of M′

KU spanned by the objects

where ΓU and ΓK denote the global sections functors (given by evaluation at X ∈ U(X) ∩ K(X)). According
to Remark 7.3.1.3, to complete the proof it will suﬃce to show that MU → ∆1 is a coCartesian ﬁbration,
and that ΓU preserves both Cartesian and coCartesian edges. It is clear that ΓU preserves Cartesian edges,
since it is a composition of maps

MU ⊆ MN(U(X))op → M
which preserve Cartesian edges. Similarly, we already know that MK → ∆1 is a coCartesian ﬁbration, and
that ΓK preserves coCartesian edges. To complete the proof, it will therefore suﬃce to show that φU and φK
are equivalences of ∞-categories. We will give the argument for φU; the proof in the case of φK is identical
and left to the reader.

According to Corollary 7.3.4.10, the map φU induces equivalences

ShvKU(X; Y′) → Shv(X; Y′)

ShvKU(X; Y′′) → Shv(X; Y′′)

after passing to the ﬁbers over either vertex of ∆1. We will complete the proof by applying Corollary 2.4.4.4.
In order to do so, we must verify that p : MKU → ∆1 is a Cartesian ﬁbration, and that φU preserves
Cartesian edges.

To show that p is a Cartesian ﬁbration, we begin with an arbitrary F ∈ ShvKU(X; Y′′). Using Propo-
sition 3.1.2.1, we conclude the existence of a p′-Cartesian morphism α : F′ → F, where p′ denotes the
projection M′
KU and F′ = F ◦p∗ ∈ Fun(N(K(X) ∪ U(X))op, Y′). Since p∗ preserves limits, we conclude that
F′ | N(U(X))op is a sheaf on X with values in Y′; however, F′ is not necessarily a left Kan extension of
F′ | N(U(X))op. Let C denote the full subcategory of Fun(N(K(X) ∪ U(X))op, Y′) spanned by those func-
tors G : N(K(X) ∪ U(X))op which are left Kan extensions of G | N(U(X))op, and s a section of the trivial
ﬁbration C → (Y′)N(U(X))op
KU → (Y′)N(U(X))op

Let F′′ = (s ◦ r) F′ be a left Kan extension of F′ | N(U(X))op. Then F′′ is an initial object of the ﬁber
M′
KU ×Fun(N(U(X))op,Y′){F′ | N(U(X))op}, so that there exists a map β : F′′ → F′ which induces the identity

of η are contractible. The map η′ is a trivial ﬁbration (since the inclusion ∆{0,2} ⊆ ∆2 is right anodyne),
so it will suﬃce to prove that η ◦ η′ is a trivial ﬁbration. In view of the commutativity of the diagram,
it will suﬃce to show that θ0, θ1, and θ2 are trivial ﬁbrations. The triviality of θ0 follows from the fact
1 ⊆ ∆2 is right anodyne. The triviality of θ2 follows from the fact that α is

Without loss of generality, we may suppose that G = s(G′), where G′ ∈ Shv(X; Y′); now we simply invoke
the adjointness of s with the restriction functor r and the observation that r(β) is an equivalence.

Corollary 7.3.4.12. Let X be a compact Hausdorﬀ space. The global sections functor Γ : Shv(X) → S
preserves ﬁltered colimits.

Proof. Applying Theorem 7.3.4.9, we can replace Shv(X) by ShvK(X). Now observe that the full sub-
category ShvK(X) ⊆ P(N(K(X))op) is stable under ﬁltered colimits. We thereby reduce to proving that
the evaluation functor P(N(K(X))op) → S commutes with ﬁltered colimits, which follows from Proposition
5.1.2.2. Alternatively, one can apply Corollary 7.3.4.10 and Remark 7.3.1.5.

Remark 7.3.4.13. One can also deduce Corollary 7.3.4.12 using the geometric model for Shv(X) introduced
in §7.1. Using the characterization of properness in terms of ﬁltered colimits described in Remark 7.3.1.5,
one can formally deduce Corollary 7.3.4.11 from Corollary 7.3.4.12. This leads to another proof of the proper
base change theorem, which does not make use of Theorem 7.3.4.9 or the other ideas of this section. However,
this alternative proof is considerably more diﬃcult than the one described here, since it requires a rigorous
justiﬁcation of Remark 7.3.1.5. We also note that Theorem 7.3.4.9 and Corollary 7.3.4.10 are interesting in
their own right, and could conceivably be applied in other contexts.

7.3.5 Sheaves on Coherent Spaces

Theorem 7.3.4.9 has an analogue in the setting of coherent topological spaces which is somewhat easier to
prove. First, we need the analogue of Lemma 7.3.4.8:

Lemma 7.3.5.1. Let X be a coherent topological space, let U0(X) denote the collection of compact open
subsets of X, and let F : N(U0(X))op → C be a presheaf taking values in an ∞-category C, having the
following properties:

(1) The object F(∅) ∈ C is ﬁnal.

(2) For every pair of compact open sets U, V ⊆ X, the diagram

F(U ∩ V )

F(U )

F(V )

/ F(U ∪ V )

is a pullback.

Let W be a covering of X by compact open subsets, and let U1(X) ⊆ U0(X) be collection of all compact open
subsets of X which are contained in some element of W. Then F is a right Kan extension of F | N(U1(X))op.
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 7.3.4.8, but slightly easier. Let us say that a covering W of a
coherent topological space X by compact open subsets is good if it satisﬁes the conclusions of the Lemma.
We observe that W automatically has a ﬁnite subcover. We will prove, by induction on n ≥ 0, that if W is
collection of open subsets of a locally coherent topological space X such that there exist W1, . . . , Wn ∈ W
with W1 ∪ . . . ∪ Wn = X, then W is a good covering of X. If n = 0, then X = ∅. In this case, we must prove
that F(∅) is ﬁnal, which is one of our assumptions.

Suppose that W ⊆ W′ are coverings of X by compact open sets, and that for every W ′ ∈ W′ the induced
covering {W ∩ W ′ : W ∈ W} is a good covering of W ′. It then follows from Proposition 4.3.2.8 that W′ is a
good covering of X if and only if W is a good covering of X.

Now suppose n > 0. Let V = W2 ∪ . . . ∪ Wn, and let W′ = W ∪{V }. Using the above remark and the
inductive hypothesis, it will suﬃce to show that W′ is a good covering of X. Now W′ contains a pair of
open sets W1 and V which cover X. We thereby reduce to the case n = 2; using the above remark we can
furthermore suppose that W = {W1, W2}.

We now wish to show that for every compact U ⊆ X, F exhibits F(U ) as the limit of F | N(U1(X)/U )op.
Without loss of generality, we may replace X by U and thereby reduce to the case U = X. Let U2(X) =
{W1, W2, W1 ∩ W2} ⊆ U1(X). Using Theorem 4.1.3.1, we deduce that the inclusion N(U2(X)) ⊆ N(U1(X))
is coﬁnal. Consequently, it suﬃces to prove that F(X) is the limit of the diagram F | N(U2(X))op. In other
words, we must show that the diagram

F(X)

F(W1)

F(W2)

/ F(W1 ∩ W2)

is a pullback in C, which is true by assumption.

Theorem 7.3.5.2. Let X be a coherent topological space, and let U0(X) ⊆ U(X) denote the collection of
compact open subsets of X. Let C be an ∞-category which admits small limits. The restriction map

Shv(X; C) → Fun(N(U0(X))op, C)
is fully faithful, and its essential image consists of precisely those functors F0 : N(U0(X))op → C satisfying
the following conditions:

(1) The object F0(∅) ∈ C is ﬁnal.

(2) For every pair of compact open sets U, V ⊆ X, the diagram

is a pullback.

be the full subcategory spanned by those presheaves F : N(U(X))op → C which
are right Kan extensions of F0 = F | N(U0(X))op, and such that F0 satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2). According
to Proposition 4.3.2.15, it will suﬃce to show that D coincides with Shv(X; C).

Suppose that F : N(U(X))op → C is a sheaf. We ﬁrst show that F is a right Kan extension of F0 =

is a sheaf, it suﬃces to prove that U(X)(1)
/U is a covering sieve. In other words, we need to prove that U is a
union of compact open subsets of X, which follows immediately from our assumption that X is coherent.

We next prove that F0 satisﬁes (1) and (2). To prove (1), we simply observe that the empty sieve is a
cover of ∅ and apply the sheaf condition. To prove (2), we may assume without loss of generality that neither
U nor V is contained in the other (otherwise the result is obvious). Let U(X)(0)
/U∪V be the full subcategory
spanned by U , V , and U ∩ V , and let U(X)(1)

It remains to prove that D ⊆ Shv(X; C). In other words, we must show that if F is a right Kan extension
of F0 = F | N(U0(X))op, and F0 satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2), then F is a sheaf. Let U be an open subset
of X, U(X)(0)
/U a sieve which covers U . Let U0(X)/U denote the category of compact open subsets of U
/U the category of compact open subsets of U which belong to the sieve U(X)(0)

/U . We wish to
prove that F(U ) is a limit of F | N(U(X)(0)

We have a commutative diagram

Corollary 7.3.5.3. Let X be a coherent topological space. Then the global sections functor Γ : Shv(X) → S
is a proper map of ∞-topoi.

Proof. Identical to the proof of Corollary 7.3.4.11, using Theorem 7.3.5.2 in place of Corollary 7.3.4.10.

Corollary 7.3.5.4. Let X be a coherent topological space. Then the global sections functor

Γ : Shv(X) → S

commutes with ﬁltered colimits.

7.3.6 Cell-Like Maps

Recall that a topological space X is an absolute neighborhood retract if X is metrizable and if for any closed
immersion X ֒→ Y of X in a metric space Y , there exists an open set U ⊆ Y containing the image of X,
such that the inclusion X ֒→ U has a left inverse (in other words, X is a retract of U ).

Let p : X → Y be a continuous map between locally compact absolute neighborhood retracts. The map
p is said to be cell-like if p is proper and each ﬁber Xy = X ×Y {y} has trivial shape (in the sense of Borsuk;
see [55] and §7.1.6). The theory of cell-like maps plays an important role in geometric topology: we refer
the reader to [18] for a discussion (and for several equivalent formulations of the condition that a map be
cell-like).

The purpose of this section is to describe a class of geometric morphisms between ∞-topoi, which we will
call cell-like morphisms. We will then compare our theory of cell-like morphisms with the classical theory
of cell-like maps. We will also give a “nonclassical” example which arises in the theory of rigid analytic
geometry.

Deﬁnition 7.3.6.1. Let p∗ : X → Y be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. We will say that p∗ is cell-like if
it is proper and if the right adjoint p∗ (which is well-deﬁned up to equivalence) is fully faithful.

Warning 7.3.6.2. Many authors refer to a map p : X → Y of arbitrary compact metric spaces as cell-
like if each ﬁber Xy = X ×Y {y} has trivial shape. This condition is generally weaker than the condition
that p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) be cell-like in the sense of Deﬁnition 7.3.6.1. However, the two deﬁnitions are
equivalent provided that X and Y are suﬃciently nice (for example, if they are locally compact absolute
neighborhood retracts). Our departure from the classical terminology is perhaps justiﬁed by the fact that
the class of morphisms introduced in Deﬁnition 7.3.6.1 has good formal properties: for example, stability
under composition.

Remark 7.3.6.3. Let p∗ : X → Y be a cell-like geometric morphism between ∞-topoi. Then the unit map
idY → p∗p∗ is an equivalence of functors. It follows immediately that p∗ induces an equivalence of shapes
Sh(X) → Sh(Y) (see §7.1.6.

Proposition 7.3.6.4. Let p∗ : X → Y be a proper morphism of ∞-topoi. Suppose that Y has enough points.
Then p∗ is cell-like if and only if, for every pullback diagram

in RTop, the ∞-topos X′ has trivial shape.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that each ﬁber X′ has trivial shape. Let F ∈ Y. We wish to show that the unit map
u : F → p∗p∗ F is an equivalence. Since Y has enough points, it suﬃces to show that for each point q∗ : S → Y,
the map q∗u is an equivalence in S, where q∗ denotes a left adjoint to q∗. Form a pullback diagram of ∞-topoi

X′

Since p∗ is proper, this diagram is left-adjointable. Consequently, q∗u can be identiﬁed with the unit map

where K = q∗ F ∈ S. If X′ has trivial shape, then this map is an equivalence.

Conversely, if p∗ is cell-like, then the above argument shows that for every diagram

K → s∗s∗K,

as above and every F ∈ Y, the adjunction map

X′

X

s∗

p∗

S

q∗

/ Y

K → s∗s∗K

is an equivalence, where K = q∗ F. To prove that X′ has trivial shape, it will suﬃce to show that q∗ is
essentially surjective. For this, we observe that since S is a ﬁnal object in the ∞-category of ∞-topoi, there
exists a geometric morphism r∗ : Y → S such that r∗ ◦ q∗ is homotopic to idS. It follows that q∗ ◦ r∗ ≃ idS.
Since idS is essentially surjective, we conclude that q∗ is essentially surjective.

Corollary 7.3.6.5. Let p : X → Y be a map of paracompact topological spaces. Assume that p∗ is proper,
and that Y has ﬁnite covering dimension. Then p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) is cell-like if and only if each ﬁber
Xy = X ×Y {y} has trivial shape.

Proof. Combine Proposition 7.3.6.4 with Corollary 7.2.1.17.

Proposition 7.3.6.6. Let p : X → Y be a proper map of locally compact ANRs. The following conditions
are equivalent:

(1) The geometric morphism p∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(Y ) is cell-like.

(2) For every open subset U ⊆ Y , the restriction map X ×Y U → U is a homotopy equivalence.

(3) Each ﬁber Xy = X ×Y {y} has trivial shape.

Proof. It is easy to see that if p∗ is cell-like, then each of the restrictions p′ : X ×Y U → U induces a cell-like
geometric morphism. According to Remark 7.3.6.3, p′
∗ is a shape equivalence, and therefore a homotopy
equivalence by Proposition 7.1.6.8. Thus (1) ⇒ (2).

We next prove that (2) ⇒ (1). Let F ∈ Shv(Y ), and let u : F → p∗p∗ F be a unit map; we wish to show
that u is an equivalence. It will suﬃce to show that the induced map F(U ) → (p∗p∗ F)(U ) is an equivalence
in S for each paracompact open subset U ⊆ Y . Replacing Y by u, we may reduce to the problem of showing
that the map F(Y ) → (p∗ F)(X) is a homotopy equivalence. According to Corollary 7.1.4.4, we may assume
that F is the simplicial nerve of SingY
Y is a ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object of Top/Y . According to

The implication (1) ⇒ (3) follows from the proof of Proposition 7.3.6.6, and the implication (3) ⇒ (2) is

classical (see [37]).

Remark 7.3.6.7. It is possible to prove the following generalization of Proposition 7.3.6.6: a proper ge-
ometric morphism p∗ : X → Y is cell-like if and only if, for each object U ∈ Y, the associated geometric
morphism X/p∗U → Y/U is a shape equivalence (and, in fact, it is only necessary to check this on a collection
of objects U ∈ Y which generates Y under colimits).

Remark 7.3.6.8. Another useful property of the class of cell-like morphisms, which we will not prove here,
is stability under base change: given a pullback diagram

X′

p′
∗

Y′

/ X

p∗

/ Y

where p∗ is cell-like, p′

∗ is also cell-like.

If p∗ : X → Y is a cell-like morphism of ∞-topoi, then many properties of Y are controlled by the analogous

properties of X. For example:

Proposition 7.3.6.9. Let p∗ : X → Y be a cell-like morphism of ∞-topoi. If X has homotopy dimension
≤ n, then Y also has homotopy dimension ≤ n.

Proof. Let 1Y be a ﬁnal object of Y, U an n-connective object of Y, and p∗ a left adjoint to p∗. We
wish to prove that Homh Y(1Y, U ) is nonempty. Since p∗ is fully faithful,
it will suﬃce to prove that
HomhX(p∗1Y, p∗U ). We now observe that p∗1Y is a ﬁnal object of X (since p is left exact), p∗U is n-connective
(Proposition 6.5.1.16), and X has homotopy dimension ≤ n, so that HomhX(p∗1Y, p∗U ) is nonempty as de-
sired.

We conclude with a diﬀerent example of a class of cell-like maps. We will assume in the following
discussion that the reader is familiar with the basic ideas of rigid analytic geometry; for an account of this
theory we refer the reader to [29]. Let K be ﬁeld which is complete with respect to a non-Archimedean
absolute value ||K : K → R. Let A be an aﬃnoid algebra over K: that is, a quotient of an algebra of
convergent power series (in several variables) with values in K. Let X be the rigid space associated to A.
One can associate to X two diﬀerent “underlying” topological spaces:

(ZR1) The category C of rational open subsets of X has a Grothendieck topology, given by admissible aﬃne
covers. The topos of sheaves of sets on C is localic, and the underlying locale has enough points: it
is therefore isomorphic to the locale of open subsets of a (canonically determined) topological space
XZR, the Zariski-Riemann space of X.

(ZR2) In the case where K is a discretely valued ﬁeld with ring of integers R, one may deﬁne XZR to be the

inverse limit of the underlying spaces of all formal schemes

X → Spf R which have generic ﬁber X.

(ZR3) Concretely, XZR can be identiﬁed with the set of all isomorphism classes of continuous multiplicative
seminorms ||A : A → M ∪ {∞}, where M is an ordered abelian group containing the value group
|K ∗|K ⊆ R∗, and the restriction of ||A to K is ||K.

(B1) The category of sheaves of sets on C contains a full subcategory, consisting of overconvergent sheaves.
This category is also a localic topos, and the underyling locale is isomorphic to the lattice of open
subsets of a (canonically determined) topological space XB, the Berkovich space of X. The category of
overconvergent sheaves is a localization of the category of all sheaves on C, and there is an associated
map of topological spaces p : XZR → XB.

(B2) Concretely, XB can be identiﬁed with the set of all continuous multiplicative seminorms ||A : A →
R ∪{∞} which extend ||K. It is equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence, and is a compact
Hausdorﬀ space.

The relationship between the Zariski-Riemann space XZR and the Berkovich space XB (or, more concep-
tually, the relationship between the category of all sheaves on X and the category of overconvergent sheaves
on X) is neatly summarized by the following result.

Proposition 7.3.6.10. Let K be a ﬁeld which is complete with respect to a non-Archimedean absolute value
||K, let A be an aﬃnoid algebra over K, let X be the associated rigid space, and p : XZR → XB the natural
map. Then p induces a cell-like morphism of ∞-topoi p∗ : Shv(XZR) → Shv(XB).

Before giving the proof, we need an easy lemma. Recall that a topological space X is irreducible if every

ﬁnite collection of nonempty open subsets of X has nonempty intersections.

Lemma 7.3.6.11. Let X be an irreducible topological space. Then Shv(X) has trivial shape.

Proof. Let π : X → ∗ be the projection from X to a point, π∗ : Shv(X) → Shv(∗) the induced geometric
morphism. We will construct a left adjoint π∗ to π∗ such that the unit map id → π∗π∗ is an equivalence.

We begin by deﬁning G : P(X) → P(∗) to be the functor given by composition with π−1, so that

G| Shv(X) = π∗. Let

be deﬁned so that

i : N(U(X))op → N(U(∗))op

i(U ) =

∅
if U = ∅
{∗} if U 6= ∅,

(

and let F : P(∗) → P(U ) be given by composition with i. We observe that F is a left Kan extension functor,
so that the identity map

idP(∗) → G ◦ F
exhibits F as a left adjoint to G. We will show that F (Shv(∗)) ⊆ Shv(X). Setting π∗ = F | Shv(∗), we
conclude that the identity map

idShv(∗) → π∗π∗

is the unit of an adjunction between π∗ and π∗, which will complete the proof.

Let U ⊆ U(X) be a sieve which covers the open set U ⊆ X. We wish to prove that the diagram

p : N(Uop)⊳ → N(U(X))op i→ N(U(∗))op F

→ S

is a limit. Let U0 = {V ∈ U : V 6= ∅}. Since F(∅) is a ﬁnal object of S, p is a limit if and only if p| N(Uop
0 )⊳
is a limit diagram. If U = ∅, then this follows from the fact that F(∅) is ﬁnal in S. If U 6= ∅, then p| N(Uop
0 )⊳
is a constant diagram, so it will suﬃce to prove that the simplicial set N(U0)op is weakly contractible. This
follows from the observation that Uop
is a ﬁltered partially ordered set, since U0 is nonempty and stable
0
under ﬁnite intersections (because X is irreducible).

Proof of Proposition 7.3.6.10. We ﬁrst show that p∗ is a proper map of ∞-topoi. We note that p factors as
a composition

XZR

p′
→ XZR × XB

p′′
→ XB.

618

The map p′ is a pullback of the diagonal map XB → XB × XB. Since XB is Hausdorﬀ, p′ is a closed
immersion. It follows p′
∗ is a closed immersion of ∞-topoi (Corollary 7.3.2.9) and therefore a proper morphism
(Proposition 7.3.2.12). It therefore suﬃces to prove that p′′ is a proper map of ∞-topoi. We note the existence
of a commutative diagram

Shv(XZR × XB)

/ Shv(XZR)

p′′
∗

g∗

Shv(XB)

/ Shv(∗).

Using Proposition 7.3.1.11, we deduce that this is a homotopy Cartesian diagram of ∞-topoi. It therefore
suﬃces to show that the global sections functor g∗ : Shv(XZR) → Shv(∗) is proper, which follows from
Corollary 7.3.5.3.

We now observe that the topological space XB is paracompact and has ﬁnite covering dimension ([5],
Corollary 3.2.8), so that Shv(XB) has enough points (Corollary 7.2.1.17). According to Proposition 7.3.6.4,
it suﬃces to show that for every ﬁber diagram

X′

Shv(XZR)

Shv(∗)

q∗

/ Shv(XB),

the ∞-topos X′ has trivial shape. Using Lemma 6.4.5.6, we conclude that q∗ is necessarily induced by a
homomorphism of locales U(XB) → U(∗), which corresponds to an irreducible closed subset of XB. Since
XB is Hausdorﬀ, this subset consists of a single (closed) point x. Using Proposition 7.3.2.12 and Corollary
7.3.2.9, we can identify X′ with the ∞-topos Shv(Y ), where Y = XZR ×XB {x}. We now observe that the
topological space Y is coherent and irreducible (it contains a unique “generic” point), so that Shv(Y ) has
trivial shape by Lemma 7.3.6.11.

Remark 7.3.6.12. Let p∗ : Shv(XZR) → Shv(XB) be as in Proposition 7.3.6.10. Then p∗ has a fully
faithful left adjoint p∗. We might say that an object of Shv(XZR) is overconvergent if it belongs to the
essential image of p∗; for sheaves of sets, this agrees with the classical terminology.

Remark 7.3.6.13. One can generalize Proposition 7.3.6.10 to rigid spaces which are not aﬃnoid; we leave
the details to the reader.

Appendix A

Appendix

This appendix is comprised of three parts. In §A.1, we will review some ideas from classical category theory,
such as monoidal structures, enriched categories, and Quillen’s small object argument. We give a brief
overview of the theory of model categories in §A.2. The main result here is Proposition A.2.6.13, which will
allow us to establish the existence of model category structures in a variety of situations with a minimal
amount of eﬀort. In §A.3 we will use this result to make detailed study of the theory of simplicial categories.
Our exposition is rather dense; for a more leisurely account of the theory of model categories we refer the
reader to one of the standard texts, such as [40].

A.1 Category Theory

Familiarity with classical category theory is the main prerequisite for reading this book. In this section, we
will ﬁx some of the notation that we will use when discussing categories, and summarize (generally without
proofs) some of the concepts which we will use in the body of the text.

If C is a category, we let Ob(C) denote the set of objects of C. We will write X ∈ C to mean that X is an
object of C. For X, Y ∈ C, we write HomC(X, Y ) for the set of morphisms from X to Y in C. We also write
idX for the identity automorphism of X ∈ C (regarded as an element of HomC(X, X)).

If Z is an object in a category C, then the overcategory C/Z of objects over Z is deﬁned as follows: the
objects of C/Z are diagrams X → Z in C. A morphism from f : X → Z to g : Y → Z is a commutative
triangle

X

 AAAAAAAA

f

Z.

Y

~}}}}}}}

g

Dually, we have an undercategory CZ/ = ((Cop)Z/)op of objects under Z.

If f : X → Z and g : Y → Z are objects in C/Z , then we will often write HomZ (X, Y ) rather than

HomC/Z (f, g).

We let Set denote the category of sets, and Cat the category of (small) categories (where the morphisms

are given by functors).

If κ is a regular cardinal, we will say that a set S is κ-small if it has cardinality less than κ. We will also
use this terminology when discussing mathematical objects other than sets, which are built out of sets. For
example, we will say that a category C is κ-small if the set of all objects of C is κ-small, and the set of all
morphisms in C is likewise κ-small.

We will need to discuss categories which are not small. In order to minimize the eﬀort spent dealing with
set-theoretic complications, we will adopt the usual device of “Grothendieck universes”. We ﬁx a strongly
inaccessible cardinal κ, and refer to a mathematical object (such as a set or category) as small if it is κ-small,
and large otherwise. It should be emphasized that this is primarily a linguistic device, and that none of our
results depend in an essential way on the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal κ.

Throughout this book, the word “topos” will always mean Grothendieck topos. Strictly speaking, a
knowledge of classical topos theory is not required to read this paper: all of the relevant classical concepts
will be introduced (though sometimes in a hurried fashion) in the course of our search for suitable ∞-
categorical analogues.

A.1.1 Compactness and Presentability

Let κ be a regular cardinal.

Deﬁnition A.1.1.1. A partially ordered set I is κ-ﬁltered if, for any subset I0 ⊆ I having cardinality < κ,
there exists an upper bound for I0 in I.

Let C be a category which admits (small) colimits, and let X be an object of C. Suppose given a κ-ﬁltered
partially ordered set I and a diagram {Yα}α∈I in C, indexed by I. Let Y denote a colimit of this diagram.
There there is an associated map of sets

ψ : lim
−→

HomC(X, Yα) → HomC(X, Y ).

We say that X is κ-compact if ψ is bijective, for every κ-ﬁltered partially ordered set I and every diagram
{Yα} indexed by I. We say that X is small if it is κ-compact for some (small) regular cardinal κ. In this
case, X is κ-compact for all suﬃciently large regular cardinals κ.

Deﬁnition A.1.1.2. A category C is presentable if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

621

/
/
 
~
(1) The category C admits all (small) colimits.

(2) There exists a (small) set S of objects of C which generates C under colimits; in other words, every

object of C may be obtained as the colimit of a (small) diagram taking values in S.

(3) Every object in C is small. (Assuming (2), this is equivalent to the assertion that every object which

belongs to S is small.)

(4) For any pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the set HomC(X, Y ) is small.

Remark A.1.1.3. In §5.5, we describe an ∞-categorical generalization of Deﬁnition A.1.1.2.

Remark A.1.1.4. For more details of the theory of presentable categories, we refer the reader to [1]. Note
that our terminology diﬀers slightly from that of [1], in which our presentable categories are called locally
presentable categories.

A.1.2 Lifting Problems and the Small Object Argument

Let C be a category, and let p : A → B and q : X → Y be morphisms in C. Recall that p is said to have the
left lifting property with respect to q, and q the right lifting property with respect to p, if given any diagram

A

p
~

B

~

~

/ X
>~

q

/ Y

there exists a dotted arrow as indicated, rendering the diagram commutative.

Remark A.1.2.1. In the case where Y is a ﬁnal object of C, we will instead say that X has the extension
property with respect to p : A → B.

Let S be any collection of morphisms in C. We deﬁne ⊥S to be the class of all morphisms which have
the right lifting property with respect to all morphisms in S, and S⊥ to be the class of all morphisms which
have the left lifting property with respect to all morphisms in S. We observe that

S ⊆ (⊥S)⊥.

The class of morphisms (⊥S)⊥ enjoys several stability properties which we axiomatize in the following

deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition A.1.2.2. Let C be a category with all (small) colimits, and let S be a class of morphisms of C.
We will say that S is weakly saturated if it has the following properties:

(1) (Closure under the formation of pushouts) Given a pushout diagram

such that f belongs to S, the morphism f ′ also belongs to S.

(2) (Closure under transﬁnite composition) Let C ∈ C be an object, α an ordinal, and let {Dβ}β<α be
in other words, for each β < α, we are supplied with a

a system of objects of CC/ indexed by α:
morphism C → Dβ, and for each γ ≤ β < α a commutative diagram

φγ,β

Dβ

satisfying φβ,γ ◦ φγ,δ = φβ,δ. For β ≤ α, we let D<β be a colimit of the system {Dγ}γ<β, taken in the
category CC/.
Suppose that, for each β < α, the natural map D<β → Dβ belongs to S. Then the induced map
C → D<α belongs to S.

(3) (Closure under the formation of retracts) Given a commutative diagram

C

f

D

/ C′

g

/ D′

/ C

in which both horizontal compositions are the identity, if g belongs to S, then so does f .

It is worth noting that saturation has the following consequences:

Proposition A.1.2.3. Let C be a category which admits all (small) colimits, and let S be a weakly saturated
class of morphism in C. Then:

(1) Every isomorphism belongs to S.

(2) The class S is stable under composition: if f : X → Y and g : Y → Z belong to S, then so does g ◦ f .

Proof. Assertion (1) is equivalent to the closure of S under transﬁnite composition, in the special case where
α = 0; (2) is equivalent to the special case where α = 2.

Remark A.1.2.4. A reader who is ill-at-ease with the style of the preceding argument should feel free to
take the asserted properties as part of the deﬁnition of a weakly saturated class of morphisms.

The intersection of any collection of weakly saturated classes of morphisms is itself weakly saturated.
Consequently, for any category C which admits small colimits, and any collection A of morphisms of C, there
exists a smallest weakly saturated class of morphisms containing A: we will call this the weakly saturated
class of morphisms generated by A. We note that (⊥A)⊥ is weakly saturated. Under appropriate set-theoretic
assumptions, Quillen’s “small object” argument can be used to establish that (⊥A)⊥ is the weakly saturated
class generated by A:

Proposition A.1.2.5 (Small Object Argument). Let C be a presentable category and A0 = {φi : Ci →
Di}i∈I a collection of morphisms in C indexed by a (small) set I. For each n ≥ 0, let C[n] denote the category
of functors from the linearly ordered set [n] = {0, . . . , n} into C. There exists a functor T : C[1] → C[2] with
the following properties:

(2) If κ is a regular cardinal such that each of the objects Ci, Di is κ-compact, then T commutes with

κ-ﬁltered colimits.

Proof. Fix a regular cardinal κ as in (2), and ﬁx a morphism f : X → Z in C. We will give a functorial

Remark A.1.2.6. If C is enriched, tensored and cotensored over another presentable monoidal category S
(see §A.1.4), then a similar construction shows that we can choose T to be a S-enriched functor.

Corollary A.1.2.7. Let C be a presentable category, and let A be a set of morphisms of C. Then (⊥A)⊥ is
the smallest weakly saturated class of morphisms containing A.

Proof. Let A be the smallest weakly saturated class of morphisms containing A, so that A ⊆ (⊥A)⊥. To
establish the reverse inclusion, For the reverse inclusion, let us suppose that f : X → Z belongs to (⊥A)⊥.
Proposition A.1.2.5 implies the existence of a factorization

where f ′ ∈ A and f ′′ belongs to ⊥A. It follows that f has the left lifting property with respect to f ′′, so
that f is a retract of f ′ and therefore belongs to A.

A.1.3 Monoidal Categories

A monoidal category is a category C equipped with a (coherently) associative “product” functor ⊗ : C × C → C
and a unit object 1. The associativity is expressed by demanding isomorphisms

and the requirement that 1 be unital is expressed by demanding isomorphisms

ηA,B,C : (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C → A ⊗ (B ⊗ C),

αA : A ⊗ 1 → A

βA : 1 ⊗ A → A.

We do not merely require the existence of these isomorphisms: they are part of the structure of a monoidal
category. Moreover, these isomorphisms are required to satisfy the following conditions:

• The isomorphism ηA,B,C depends functorially on the triple (A, B, C); in other words, η may be regarded

as a natural isomorphism between the functors

C × C × C → C .

(A, B, C) 7→ (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C

(A, B, C) 7→ A ⊗ (B ⊗ C).

Similarly αA and βA depend functorially on A.

MacLane’s coherence theorem asserts that the commutativity of this pair of diagrams implies the com-
mutativity of all diagrams that can be written using only the isomorphisms ηA,B,C , αA, and βA. More
precisely, any monoidal category is equivalent (as a monoidal category) to a strict monoidal category: that
is, a monoidal category in which ⊗ is literally associative, 1 is literally a unit with respect to ⊗, and the
isomorphisms ηA,B,C , αA, βA are the identity maps.

Example A.1.3.1. Let C be a category which admits ﬁnite products. Then C admits the structure of a
monoidal category, where the operation ⊗ is given by Cartesian product

A ⊗ B ≃ A × B

and the isomorphisms ηA,B,C are induced from the evident associativity of the Cartesian product. The
identity 1 is deﬁned to be the ﬁnal object of C, and the isomorphisms αA and βA are determined in the
obvious way. We refer to this monoidal structure on C as the Cartesian monoidal structure.

We remark that the Cartesian product A × B is only well-deﬁned up to (unique) isomorphism (as is the
ﬁnal object 1), so that strictly speaking the Cartesian monoidal structure on C depends on various choices;
however, all such choices lead to (canonically) equivalent monoidal categories.

Remark A.1.3.2. Let (C, ⊗, 1, η, α, β) be a monoidal category. We will generally abuse notation by simply
saying that C is a monoidal category, or that (C, ⊗) is a monoidal category, or that ⊗ is a monoidal structure
on C; the other structure is implicitly understood to be present as well.

Remark A.1.3.3. Let C be a category equipped with a monoidal structure ⊗. Then we may deﬁne a new
monoidal structure on C, by setting A ⊗op B = B ⊗ A. We refer to this monoidal structure ⊗op as the
opposite of the monoidal structure ⊗.

Deﬁnition A.1.3.4. A monoidal category (C, ⊗) is said to be left closed if, for each A ∈ C, the functor

admits a right adjoint

N 7→ A ⊗ N

Y 7→ AY.

We say that (C, ⊗) is right-closed if the opposite monoidal structure (C, ⊗op) is left-closed; in other words, if
every functor

has a right adjoint

N 7→ N ⊗ A

Y 7→ Y A.

Finally, we say that (C, ⊗) is closed if it is both right-closed and left-closed.

In the setting of monoidal categories, it is appropriate to consider only those functors which are compatible

with the monoidal structures in the following sense:

Deﬁnition A.1.3.5. Let (C, ⊗) and (D, ⊗) be monoidal categories. A right-lax monoidal functor from C to
D consists of the following data:

A natural transformation between right-lax monoidal functors is monoidal if it commutes with the maps

γA,B, e.

Dually, a left-lax monoidal functor from C to D consists of a right-lax monoidal functor from Cop to
Dop; it is determined by giving a functor F : C → D together with a map e′ : F (1C) → 1D and a natural
transformation

γ′
A,B : F (A ⊗ B) → F (A) ⊗ F (B)

satisfying the appropriate analogues of the conditions listed above.

If F is a right-lax monoidal functor via isomorphisms

e : 1D → F (1C)

γA,B : F (A) ⊗ F (B) → F (A ⊗ B),

then F may be regarded as a left-lax monoidal functor by setting e′ = e−1, γ′
simply say that F is a monoidal functor.

A,B = γ−1

A,B. In this case, we

Remark A.1.3.6. Let

C

F /
G

/ D

be an adjunction between categories C and D. Suppose that C and D are equipped with monoidal structures.
Then endowing G with the structure of a right-lax monoidal functor is equivalent to endowing F with the
structure of a left-lax monoidal functor.

Example A.1.3.7. Let C and D be categories which admit ﬁnite products, and let F : C → D be a functor
between them. Then, if we regard C and D as endowed with the Cartesian monoidal structure, then F
acquires the structure of a left lax-monoidal functor in a canonical way, via the maps F (A×B) → F (A)×F (B)
induced from the functoriality of F . In this case, F is a monoidal functor if and only if it commutes with
ﬁnite products.

A.1.4 Enriched Category Theory

One frequently encounters categories D in which the collections of morphisms HomD(X, Y ) between two
objects X, Y ∈ D has additional structure: for example, a topology, or a group structure, or the structure
of a vector space. These situations may all be eﬃciently described using the language of enriched category
theory, which we now introduce.

Let (C, ⊗) be a monoidal category. A C-enriched category D consists of the following data:

(1) A collection of objects.

(2) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ D, a mapping object MapD(X, Y ) of C.

(3) For every triple of objects X, Y, Z ∈ D, a composition map

MapD(Y, Z) ⊗ MapD(X, Y ) → MapD(X, Z).

Composition is required to be associative in the sense that for any W, X, Y, Z ∈ C, the diagram

MapD(Z, Y ) ⊗ MapD(Y, X) ⊗ MapD(X, W )

MapD(Z, X) ⊗ MapD(X, W )

MapD(Z, Y ) ⊗ MapD(Y, W )

/ MapD(Z, W )

is commutative.

(4) For every object X ∈ D, a unit map 1 → MapD(X, X) rendering commutative the diagrams

Example A.1.4.1. Suppose that (C, ⊗) is a right-closed monoidal category. Then C is enriched over itself
in a natural way, if one deﬁnes MapC(X, Y ) = Y X .

Example A.1.4.2. Let C be the category of sets, with the Cartesian monoidal structure. Then a C-enriched
category is simply a category in the usual sense.

Remark A.1.4.3. Let G : C → C′ be a right-lax monoidal functor between monoidal categories. Suppose
that D is a category enriched over C. We may deﬁne a category G(D), enriched over C′, as follows:

(1) The objects of G(D) are the objects of D.

(2) Given objects X, Y ∈ D, we set

MapG(D)(X, Y ) = G(MapD(X, Y )).

(3) The composition in G(D) is given by the map

G(MapD(Y, Z)) ⊗ G(MapD(X, Y )) → G(MapD(Y, Z) ⊗ MapD(X, Y )) → G(MapD(X, Z)).

Here the ﬁrst map is determined by the right-weakly monoidal structure on the functor G, and the
second is obtained by applying G to the composition law in the category D.

(4) For every object X ∈ D, the associated unit G(D) is given by the composition

1C′ → G(1C) → G(MapD(X, X)).

Remark A.1.4.4. If D and D′ are categories enriched over the same monoidal category C, then one can
deﬁne a category of C-enriched functors from D to D′ in the evident way. Namely, an enriched functor
F : D → D′ consists of a map from the objects of D to the objects of D′ and a collection of morphisms

ηX,Y : MapD(X, Y ) → MapD′(F X, F Y )

with the following properties:

(i) For each object X ∈ D, the composition

1C → MapD(X, X)

ηX.X→ MapD′ (F X, F X)

coincides with the unit map for F X ∈ D′.

(ii) For every triple of objects X, Y, Z ∈ D, the diagram

MapD(X, Y ) ⊗ MapD(Y, Z)

MapD(X, Z)

MapD′ (F X, F Y ) ⊗ MapD(F Y, F Z)

/ MapD(F X, F Z)

is commutative.

If F and F ′ are enriched functors, an enriched natural transformation α from F to F ′ consists of specifying,
for each object X ∈ D, a morphism αX ∈ HomD′(F X, F ′X) which renders commutative the diagram

MapD(X, Y )

MapD′(F X, F Y )

Suppose that C is any monoidal category. Consider the functor C → Set given by

X 7→ HomC(1, X).

This is a right-lax monoidal functor from (C, ⊗) to Set, where the latter is equipped with the Cartesian
monoidal structure. By the above remarks, we see that we may equip any C-enriched category D with the
structure of an ordinary category by setting

HomD(X, Y ) = HomC(1, MapD(X, Y )).

We will generally not distinguish notationally between D as a C-enriched category and this (underlying)
category having the same objects. However, to avoid confusion, we use diﬀerent notations for the morphisms:
MapD(X, Y ) is an object of C, while HomD(X, Y ) is a set.

Let C be a right-closed monoidal category, and D a category enriched over C. Fix objects C ∈ C, X ∈ D,

and consider the functor

D → C
Y 7→ MapD(X, Y )C .
This functor may or may not be corepresentable, in the sense that there exists an object Z ∈ D and an
isomorphism of functors

η : MapD(X, •)C ≃ MapD(Z, •).

If such an object Z exists, we will denote it by X ⊗C. The natural isomorphism η is determined by specifying
a single map η(X) : C → MapD(X, X ⊗ C). By general nonsense, the map η(X) determines X ⊗ C up to
(unique) isomorphism, provided that X ⊗ C exists. If the object X ⊗ C exists for every C ∈ C, X ∈ D, then
we say that D is tensored over C. In this case, we may regard

as determining a functor D ⊗ C → D. Moreover, one has canonical isomorphisms

X ⊗ (C ⊗ D) ≃ (X ⊗ C) ⊗ D

(X, C) 7→ X ⊗ C

which express the idea that D may be regarded as equipped with an “action” of C. Here we imagine C as a
kind of generalized monoid (via its monoidal structure).

Dually, if C is right-closed, then an object of D which represents the functor

Y 7→C MapD(Y, X)

will be denoted by CX; the object CX (if it exists) is determined up to (unique) isomorphism by a map
C → MapD(CX, X). If this object exists for all C ∈ C, X ∈ D, then we say that D is cotensored over C.

Example A.1.4.5. Let C be a right-closed monoidal category. Then C may be regarded as enriched over
itself in a natural way. It is automatically tensored over itself; it is cotensored over itself if and only if it is
left-closed.

A.1.5 Trees

Let C be a presentable category and S a small collection of morphisms in C. According to Remark A.1.2.8,
the smallest weakly saturated class of morphisms S containing S can be obtained from S using pushouts,
retracts, and transﬁnite composition. It is natural to ask if the formation of retracts is necessary: that is,
does the weakly saturated class of morphisms generated by S coincide with the class of morphisms which
are given by transﬁnite compositions of pushouts of morphisms of S? Our goal for the remainder of this
section is to give an aﬃrmative answer, at least after S has been suitably enlarged (Proposition A.1.5.12).
This result is of a somewhat technical nature, and will be needed only during our discussion of combinatorial
model categories in §A.2.6.

We begin by introducing a generalization of the notion of a transﬁnite chain of morphisms.

Deﬁnition A.1.5.1. Let C be a presentable category, and let S be a collection of morphisms in C. An
S-tree in C consists of the following data:

(1) An object X ∈ C, called the root of the S-tree.

(2) A partially ordered set A which is well-founded (that is, every nonempty subset of P has a minimal

element).

(3) A diagram A → CX/, which we will denote by α 7→ Yα.

630

(4) For each α ∈ A, a pushout diagram

where f ∈ S.

Let κ be a regular cardinal. We will say that an S-tree in C is κ-good if each of the objects C and D appearing
above is κ-compact, and for each α ∈ A, the set {β ∈ A : β < α} is κ-small.

Notation A.1.5.2. Let C be a presentable category and S a collection of morphisms in C. We will indicate
an S-tree by writing {Yα}α∈A. Here the root X ∈ C and the relevant pushout diagrams are understood
implicitly to be part of the data.

Suppose given an S-tree {Yα}α∈A, and a subset B ⊆ A which is closed downwards in the following sense:
if α ∈ B and β ≤ α, then β ∈ B. Then {Yα}α∈B is an S-tree. We let YB denote the colimit lim
Yα,
formed in the category CX/. In particular we have a canonical isomorhism Y∅ ≃ X. If B = {α ∈ A|α ≤ β},
then YB ≃ Yα.
Remark A.1.5.3. Let C be a presentable category, S a collection of morphisms in C, and {Yα}αinA an
X X ′}α∈A,
S-tree in C with root X. Given a map f : X → X ′, we can form an associated S-tree {Yα
having root X ′.

−→α∈B

Example A.1.5.4. Let C be a presentable category, S a collection of morphisms in C, and {Yα}α∈A an
S-tree in C with root X. If A is linearly ordered, then we may identify {Yα}α∈A with a (possibly transﬁnite)
sequence of morphisms belonging to S,

`

as in the statement of (2) in Deﬁnition A.1.2.2.

X → Y0 → Y1 → . . . ,

Remark A.1.5.5. Let C be a presentable category, S a collection morphisms in C, and {Yα}α∈A an S-tree
in C. Let B ⊆ A be closed downward. For α ∈ A − B, let Bα = B ∪ {β ∈ A : β ≤ α}, and let Zα = YBα .
Then {Zα}α∈A−B is an S-tree in C with root YB.
Lemma A.1.5.6. Let C be a presentable category and let S be a collection of morphisms in C. Let {Yα}α∈A
be an S-tree in C, and let A′′ ⊆ A′ ⊆ A be subsets which are closed downward in A. Then the induced map
YA′′ → YA′ belongs to the weakly saturated class of morphisms generated by S. In particular, the canonical
map Y∅ → YA belongs to the weakly saturated class of morphisms generated by S.
Proof. Using Remarks A.1.5.5 and A.1.5.3, we can assume without loss of enerality that A′′ = ∅ and A′ = A.
Using the assumption that A is well-founded, we can write A as the union of a transﬁnite sequence (downward
closed) subsets {B(γ) ⊆ A}γ<β with the following property:
(∗) For each γ < β, the set B(γ) is obtained from B′(γ) =

γ′<γ B(γ′) by adjoining a minimal element of

αγ of A − B′(γ).

Lemma A.1.5.7. Let C be a presentable category, κ a regular cardinal, and let S = {fs : Cs → Ds} be a
collection of morphisms in C, where each of the objects Cs and Ds is κ-compact. Suppose that {Yα}α∈A is
an S-tree in C, indexed by a partially ordered set (A, ≤). Then there exists the following:

(1) A new ordering (cid:22) on A, which reﬁnes ≤ in the following sense: if α (cid:22) β, then α ≤ β. Let A′ denote

the partially ordered set A, with this new partial ordering.

(2) A κ-good S-tree {Y ′

α}α∈A′, having the same root X as {Yα}α∈A.

(3) A collection of maps fα : Y ′

α → Yα, which form a commutative diagram

(4) For every subset B ⊆ A which is closed downwards with respect to (cid:22), the induced map fB : Y ′

B → YB

is an isomorphism.

Proof. Choose a transﬁnite sequence of downward-closed subsets {A(γ) ⊆ A}γ≤β so that the following
conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) If γ′ ≤ γ ≤ β, then A(γ′) ⊆ A(γ).

(ii) If λ ≤ β is a limit ordinal (possibly zero), then A(λ) =

γ<λ A(γ).

(iii) If γ + 1 ≤ β, then A(γ + 1) = A(γ) ∪ {αγ}, where αγ is a minimal element of A − A(γ).

S

(iv) The subset A(β) coincides with A.

We will construct a compatible family of orderings A′(γ) = (A(γ), (cid:22)), S-trees {Y ′

α}α∈A′(γ)}, and collec-
tions of morphisms {Y ′
α → Yα}α∈A(γ) by induction on γ, so that the analogues of conditions (1) through (4)
are satisﬁed. If γ is a limit ordinal, there is nothing to do; let us assume therefore that γ < β and that the
data (A′(γ), {Y ′
α}α∈A′(γ), {fα}α∈A(γ)) has already been constructed. Let B = {α ∈ A : α < αγ}, so that we

Lemma A.1.5.8. Let C be a presentable category, κ an uncountable regular cardinal, and S a collection
of morphisms in C. Let {Yα}α∈A be a κ-good S-tree with root X, and TA : YA → YA an idempotent
endomorphism of YA in the category CX/. Let B0 be an arbitrary κ-small subset of A. Then there exists
a κ-small subset B ⊆ A which is downward closed and contains B0 and an idempotent endomorphism
TB : YB → YB such that the following diagram commutes:

Proof. Enlarging B0 if necessary, we may assume that B0 is closed downwards. For every pair of downward
closed subsets A′′ ⊆ A′ ⊆ A, let iA′′,A′ denote the canonical map from YA′′ to YA′ . Note that because
{Yα}α∈A is a κ-good S-tree, if A′ ⊆ A is closed downward and κ-small, YA′ is κ-compact when viewed as an
object of CX/. In particular, YB0 is a κ-compact object of CX/. It follows that the composition

can also be factored as a composition

where B1 ⊆ A is closed downwards and κ-small. Enlarging B1 if necessary, we may suppose that B1 contains
B0.

We now proceed to deﬁne a sequence of κ-small, downward closed subsets

of A, and maps Ti : YBi → YBi+1 . Suppose that i > 0, and that Bi and Ti−1 have already been constructed.
By compactness again, we conclude that the composite map

Lemma A.1.5.10. Let C be a presentable category, κ a regular cardinal, and suppose that C is κ-accessible:
that is, C is generated under κ-ﬁltered colimits by κ-compact objects (Deﬁnition 5.4.2.1). Let f : C → D be
a morphism between κ-compact object of C, let g : X → Y be a pushout of f (so that Y ≃ X
C D), and let
g′ : X ′ → Y ′ be a retract of g in the category of morphisms of C. Then there exists a morphism f ′ : C′ → D′

(1) The objects C′, D′ ∈ C are κ-compact.

(2) The morphism g′ is a pushout of f ′.

Lemma A.1.5.11. Let C be a presentable category, κ a regular cardinal such that C is κ-accessible, and

subsets {A(γ) ⊆ A}γ≤β so that the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(iv) The subset A(β) coincides with A.

Note that, since A is κ-small, we have β < κ.

the data is uniquely determined. The existence of such an upper bound is guaranteed by our assumption
that I is κ-ﬁltered, since γ ≤ β < κ. Let us therefore suppose that the above data has been constructed for

Proposition A.1.5.12. Let C be presentable ∞-category, κ a regular cardinal, S a weakly saturated class
of morphisms in C. Let S ⊆ S be the subset consisting of those morphisms f : X → Y in S such that X and
Y are κ-compact. Assume that:

(i) The regular cardinal κ is uncountable, and C is κ-accessible.

(ii) The set S generates S as a weakly saturated class of morphisms.

Then, for every morphism f : X → Y belonging to S, there exists an transﬁnite sequence of objects {Yγ}γ<β
of CX/ with the following properties:

(1) For every ordinal γ < β, the natural map lim

−→γ′<γ

Zγ′ → Zγ is the pushout of a morphism in S.

(2) The colimit lim

−→γ<β

Zγ is isomorphic to Y (as objects of CX/).

Proof. Remark A.1.2.8 implies the existence of a transﬁnite sequence of objects

Y0 → Y1 → . . .

in CX/ indexed by a set of ordinals A = {α|α < λ}, satisfying condition (1), such that Y is a retract of
Yα in CX/. We may view the sequence {Yα}α∈A as an S-tree in C, having root X. According to

A.2 Model Categories

One of the oldest and most successful approaches to the study of ∞-categorical phenomena is Quillen’s
theory of model categories. In this book, Quillen’s theory will play two (related) roles:

(1) The structures that we use to describe higher categories are naturally organized into model categories.
For example, ∞-categories are precisely those simplicial sets which are ﬁbrant with respect to the Joyal
model structure (Theorem 2.4.6.1). The theory of model categories provides a convenient framework
for phrasing certain results and for comparing diﬀerent models of higher category theory (see, for
example, §2.2.5).

(2) The theory of model categories can itself be regarded as an approach to higher category theory. If A is
a simplicial model category, then the subcategory A◦ ⊆ A of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects forms a ﬁbrant
simplicial category. Proposition 1.1.5.10 implies that the simplicial nerve N(A◦) is an ∞-category. We
will refer to N(A◦) as the underlying ∞-category of A. Of course, not every ∞-category arises in this
way, even up to equivalence: for example, the existence of homotopy limits and homotopy colimits in A
implies the existence of various limits and colimits in N(A◦) (Corollary 4.2.4.8). Nevertheless, we can
often use the theory of model categories to prove theorems about general ∞-categories, by reducing
to the situation of ∞-categories which arise via the above construction (every ∞-category C admits a
fully faithful embedding into N(A◦), for an appropriately chosen simplicial model category A). For
example, our proof of the ∞-categorical Yoneda lemma (Proposition 5.1.3.1) uses this strategy.

The purpose of this section is to review the theory of model categories, with an eye towards the sort of
applications described above. Our exposition is somewhat terse and we will omit many proofs. For a more
detailed account, we refer the reader to [40] (or any other text on the theory of model categories).

A.2.1 The Model Category Axioms

Deﬁnition A.2.1.1. A model category is a category C which is equipped with three distinguished classes
of morphisms in C, called coﬁbrations, ﬁbrations, and weak equivalences, in which the following axioms are
satisﬁed:

(1) The category C admits (small) limits and colimits.

(2) Given a composable pair of maps X

f
→ Y

g
→ Z, if any two of g ◦ f , f , and g are weak equivalences,

then so is the third.

(3) Suppose f : X → Y is a retract of g : X ′ → Y ′: that is, suppose there exists a commutative diagram

X

f

Y

i

i′

X ′

g

/ Y ′

r

r′

/ X

f

/ Y

where r ◦ i = idX and r′ ◦ i′ = idY . Then

(i) If g is a ﬁbration, so is f .

(ii) If g is a coﬁbration, then so is f .

(iii) If g is a weak equivalence, then so is f .

(4) Given a diagram

a dotted arrow can be found rendering the diagram commutative if either

(i) The map i is a coﬁbration, and the map p is both a ﬁbration and a weak equivalence.

(ii) The map i is both a coﬁbration and a weak equivalence, and the map p is a ﬁbration.

(5) Any map X → Z in C admits factorizations

f
→ Y
f ′
→ Y ′ g′
where f is a coﬁbration, g is a ﬁbration and a weak equivalence, f ′ is a coﬁbration and a weak
equivalence, and g′ is a ﬁbration.

g
→ Z

→ Z

X

X

A map f in a model category C is called a trivial coﬁbration if it is both a coﬁbration and a weak
equivalence; similarly f is called a trivial ﬁbration if it is both a ﬁbration and a weak equivalence. By axiom
(1), any model category C has an initial object ∅ and a ﬁnal object ∗. An object X ∈ C is said to be ﬁbrant
if the unique map X → ∗ is a ﬁbration, and coﬁbrant if the unique map ∅ → X is a coﬁbration.

Example A.2.1.2. Let C be any category which admits small limits and colimits. Then C can be endowed
with the trivial model structure:

(W ) The weak equivalences in C are the isomorphisms.

(C) Every morphism in C is a coﬁbration.

(F ) Every morphism in C is a ﬁbration.

A.2.2 The Homotopy Category of a Model Category

Let C be a model category containing an object X. A cylinder object for X is an object C together with a
j
→ X where i is a coﬁbration and j is a weak equivalence, and the composition j ◦ i is
diagram X
X → X. Dually, a path object for Y ∈ C is an object P together with a diagram
the “fold map” X

X i→ C

`

`

q
→ P

p
→ Y × Y

Y

such that q is a weak equivalence, p is a ﬁbration, and p ◦ q is the diagonal map Y → Y × Y . The existence
of cylinder and path objects follows from the factorization axiom (5) of Deﬁnition A.2.1.1 (factor the “fold
X → X as a coﬁbration followed by a trivial ﬁbration and the diagonal map Y → Y × Y as a
map” X
trivial coﬁbration followed by a ﬁbration).

`

Proposition A.2.2.1. Let C be a model category. Let X be a coﬁbrant object of C, Y a ﬁbrant object of C,
and f, g : X → Y two maps. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) For every cylinder object X

If C is a model category containing a coﬁbrant object X and a ﬁbrant object Y , we say two maps
f, g : X → Y are homotopic if the hypotheses of Proposition A.2.2.1 are satisﬁed, and write f ≃ g. The
relation ≃ is an equivalence relation on HomC(X, Y ). The homotopy category hC may be deﬁned as follows:

• The objects of hC are the ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects of C.

• For X, Y ∈ hC, the set HomhC(X, Y ) is the set of ≃-equivalence classes of HomC(X, Y ).

Composition is well-deﬁned in hC, in virtue of the fact that if f ≃ g, then f ◦ h ≃ g ◦ h (this is clear
from characterization (2) of Proposition A.2.2.1) and h′ ◦ f ≃ h′ ◦ g (this is clear from characterization (4)
of Proposition A.2.2.1), for any maps h, h′ such that the compositions are deﬁned in C.

There is another way of deﬁning hC (or at least, a category equivalent to hC): one begins with all of
C and formally adjoins inverses to all weak equivalences. Let H(C) denote the category so-obtained.
If
X ∈ C is coﬁbrant and Y ∈ C is ﬁbrant, then homotopic maps f, g : X → Y have the same image in H(C);
consequently we obtain a functor hC → H (C) which can be shown to be an equivalence. We will generally
ignore the distinction between these two categories, employing whichever description is more useful for the
problem at hand.

Remark A.2.2.2. Since C is (generally) not a small category, it is not immediately clear that H(C) has
small morphism sets; however, this follows from the equivalence between H(C) and hC.

A.2.3 A Lifting Criterion

The following basic principle will be used many times throughout this book:

Proposition A.2.3.1. Let C be model category containing coﬁbrant objects A and B, and a ﬁbrant object
X. Suppose given a coﬁbration i : A → B and any map f : A → X. Suppose moreover that there exists a
commutative diagram

[f ]

f

>~~~~~~~

g

in C, with [g] = g. (Here we let [p] denote the homotopy class in hC of a morphism p in C.)

Proof. Choose a map g′ : B → X representing the homotopy class g. Choose a cylinder object

and a factorization

A

A → C(A) → A,

a

(B

where the ﬁrst map is a coﬁbration and the second a trivial ﬁbration. We observe that C(B) is a cylinder
object for B.

Since g′ ◦ i is homotopic to f , there exists a map h0 : C(A)

A B → X with h|B = g′ and h|A = f .
A B → C(B) is a trivial coﬁbration, so h0 extends to a map h : C(B) → X. We may

The inclusion C(A)
regard h as a homotopy from g′ to g, where g ◦ i = f .

useful criterion for establishing left-properness.

Proposition A.2.4.2. Let C be a model category in which every object is coﬁbrant. Then C is left proper.

Proposition A.2.4.2 is an immediate consequence of the following basic lemma:

Proof. We wish to show that j′ is an isomorphism in the homotopy category h C. In other words, we need
to show that for every ﬁbrant object Z of C, composition with j′ induces a bijection HomhC(B′, Z) →
HomhC(B, Z).

We ﬁrst show that composition with j′ is surjective on homotopy classes. Suppose given a map f : B → Z.
Since j is a weak equivalence, the composition f ◦ i is homotopic to g ◦ j, for some g : A′ → B. According
to Proposition A.2.3.1, there is a map f ′ : B → Z such that f ′ ◦ i = g ◦ j, and such that f ′ is homotopic to
f . The amalgamation of f ′ and g determines a map B′ → Z which lifts f ′.

We now show that j′ is injective on homotopy classes. Suppose given a pair of maps s, s′ : B′ → Z. Let

P be a path object for Z. If s ◦ j′ and s′ ◦ j′ are homotopic, then there exists a commutative diagram

B

j′

B′

h

P

s×s′

/ Z × Z.

We now replace C by C/Z×Z and apply the surjectivity statement above to deduce that there is a map
h′ : B′ → P such that h is homotopic to h′ ◦ j′. The existence of h′ shows that s and s′ are homotopic, as
desired.

Suppose given a diagram

A0 ← A → A1

in a model category C. In general, the pushout A0

A A1 is poorly behaved, in the sense that a map of

`

is individually a weak equivalence. To correct this diﬃculty, it is convenient to introduce the left-derived
`
functor of “pushout”. The homotopy pushout of the diagram

A A1 → B0

choice of diagram only up to weak equivalence. (For a more systematic approach which includes a deﬁnition
of “coﬁbrant” for more complicated diagrams, we refer the reader to §A.3.3.)

be a pushout square in C. This diagram is also a homotopy pushout square if either of the following conditions
is satisﬁed:

(i) The objects A and A0 are coﬁbrant, and j is a coﬁbration.

(ii) The map j is a coﬁbration, and C is left proper.

Remark A.2.4.5. The above discussion of homotopy pushouts can be dualized; one obtains the notion of
homotopy pullbacks, and the analogue of Proposition A.2.4.4 requires either that C be a right proper model
category or that the objects in the diagram be ﬁbrant.

A.2.5 Quillen Adjunctions and Quillen Equivalences

Let C and D be model categories, and suppose given a pair of adjoint functors

C

F /
G

/ D

(here F is the left adjoint and G is the right adjoint). The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The functor F preserves coﬁbrations and trivial coﬁbrations.

(2) The functor G preserves ﬁbrations and trivial ﬁbrations.

(3) The functor F preserves coﬁbrations and the functor G preserves ﬁbrations.

(4) The functor F preserves trivial coﬁbrations and the functor G preserves trivial ﬁbrations.

644

o
o
/
/
/
o
o
y
%
$
z
o
o
If any of these equivalent conditions is satisﬁed, then we say that the pair (F, G) is a Quillen adjunction
between C and D. We also say that F is a left Quillen functor and that G is a right Quillen functor. In
this case, one can show that F preserves weak equivalences between coﬁbrant objects, and G preserves weak
equivalences between ﬁbrant objects.

Suppose that C

F /
G

/ D

is a Quillen adjunction. We may view the homotopy category hC as obtained

from C by ﬁrst passing to the full subcategory consisting of coﬁbrant objects, and then inverting all weak
equivalences. Applying a similar procedure with D, we see that because F preserves weak equivalence
between coﬁbrant objects, it induces a functor hC → hD; this functor is called the left derived functor of F
and denoted LF . Similarly, one may deﬁne the right derived functor RG of G. One can show that LF and
RG determine an adjunction between the homotopy categories hC and hD.

Proposition A.2.5.1. Let C and D be model categories, and let

C

F /
G

/ D

be a Quillen adjunction. The following are equivalent:

(1) The left derived functor LF : hC → hD is an equivalence of categories.

(2) The right derived functor RG : hD → hC is an equivalence of categories.

(3) For every coﬁbrant object C ∈ C and every ﬁbrant object D ∈ D, a map C → G(D) is a weak equivalence

in C if and only if the adjoint map F (C) → D is a weak equivalence in D.

Proof. Since the derived functors LF and RG are adjoint to one another, it is clear that (1) is equivalent to
(2). Moreover, (1) and (2) are equivalent to the assertion that the unit and counit of the adjunction

u : idC → RG ◦ LF

v : LF ◦ RG → idD

are weak equivalences. Let us consider the unit u. Choose a ﬁbrant object C of C. The composite functor
(RG ◦ LF )(C) is deﬁned to be G(D), where F (C) → D is a weak equivalence in D, and D is a ﬁbrant object
of D. Thus, u is a weak equivalence when evaluated on C if and only if for any weak equivalence F (C) → D,
the adjoint map C → G(D) is a weak equivalence. Similarly, the counit v is a weak equivalence if and only
if the converse holds. Thus (1) and (2) are equivalent to (3).

If the equivalent conditions of Proposition A.2.5.1 are satisﬁed, then we say that the adjunction (F, G)

gives a Quillen equivalence between the model categories C and D.

A.2.6 Combinatorial Model Categories

In this section, we give an overview of Jeﬀ Smith’s theory of combinatorial model categories. Our main goal
is to prove Proposition A.2.6.13, which allows us to construct model structures on a category C by specifying
the class of weak equivalences, together with a small amount of additional data.

Deﬁnition A.2.6.1 (Smith). Let A be model category. We say that A is combinatorial if the following
conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The category A is presentable.

(2) There exists a set I of generating coﬁbrations, such that the collection of all coﬁbrations in A is the

smallest weakly saturated class of morphisms containing I (see Deﬁnition A.1.2.2).

645

o
o
o
o
(3) There exists a set J of generating trivial coﬁbrations, such that the collection of all trivial coﬁbrations

in A is the smallest weakly saturated class of morphisms containing J.

If C is a combinatorial model category, then the model structure on C is uniquely determined by the
generating coﬁbrations and generating trivial coﬁbrations. However, in practice these generators might be
diﬃcult to ﬁnd. Our goal in this section is to reformulate Deﬁnition A.2.6.1 in a manner which puts more
emphasis on the category of weak equivalences in A.

In practice, it is often easier to describe the class of all weak equivalences than it is to describe a class of

generating trivial coﬁbrations.

Deﬁnition A.2.6.2. Let C be a presentable category and κ a regular cardinal. We will say that a full
subcategory C0 ⊆ C is an κ-accessible subcategory of C if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The full subcategory C0 ⊆ C is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits.

(2) There exists a (small) set of objects of C0 which generates C0 under κ-ﬁltered colimits.

We will say that C0 ⊆ C is an accessible subcategory if C0 is a κ-accessible subcategory of C, for some regular
cardinal κ.

Condition (2) of Deﬁnition A.2.6.2 admits the following reformulation:

Proposition A.2.6.3. Let κ be a regular cardinal, let C be a presentable category, and let C0 ⊆ C be a full
subcategory which is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits. Then C0 satisﬁes condition (2) of Deﬁnition A.2.6.2 if

τ ) Let A be a τ -ﬁltered partially ordered set and {Xα}α∈A a diagram of τ -compact objects of C indexed by
A. For every κ-ﬁltered subset B ⊆ A, we let XB denote (κ-ﬁltered) colimit of the diagram {Xα}α∈B.
Suppose that XA belongs to C0. Then for every τ -small subset C ⊆ A, there exists a τ -small, κ-ﬁltered
subset B ⊆ A which contains C, such that XB belongs to C0.

First, we need the following preliminary result:

Lemma A.2.6.4. Let τ ≫ κ be regular cardinals such that τ > κ, let D be presentable ∞-category, let
{Ca}a∈A and {Db}b∈B be families of τ -compact objects in D indexed by τ -ﬁltered partially ordered sets A
and B, such that

lim
−→a∈A

Ca ≃ lim

−→b∈B

Db.

Then, for every pair of τ -small subsets A0 ⊆ A, B0 ⊆ B, there exist τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subsets A′ ⊆ A,
B′ ⊆ B such that A0 ⊆ A′, B0 ⊆ B′, and lim

−→a∈A′ Ca ≃ lim

−→b∈B′ Db.

Proof. Let A be the partially ordered set of all τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subsets of A which contain A0, let B be
the partially ordered set of all τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subsets of B which contain B0, let X ∈ D be the common
Db, and let C be the full subcategory of D/X spanned by those morphisms
colimit lim
Y → X where Y is a τ -compact object of D. Let f : A → C and g : B → C be the functors described by the
formulas

Ca ≃ lim

f (A′) = (lim

g(B′) = (lim

−→a∈A′ Ca → lim

Db).

The desired result now follows by applying Lemma 5.4.6.3 to the associated diagram

N(A) → N(C) ← N(B).

Proof of Proposition A.2.6.3. First suppose that (2′
τ ) is satisﬁed for all suﬃciently large τ ≫ κ. Choose
τ ≫ κ large enough that C is generated under colimits by its full subcategory Cτ of τ -compact objects, and
τ ) is satisﬁed. Let D = Cτ ∩ C0, so that D is essentially small. We will show that D generates
such that (2′
C0 under τ -ﬁltered colimits. By assumption, every object X ∈ C can be obtained as a τ -ﬁltered colimit of
τ -compact objects {Xα}α∈A. Let A′ denote the collection of all τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subsets B ⊆ A such that
XB ∈ C0. We regard A′ as partially-ordered via inclusions. Invoking condition (2′
τ ), we deduce that XA is
the colimit of the τ -ﬁltered collection of objects {XA′}A′∈B. We now observe that each XA′ belongs to D.
Now suppose that condition (2) is satisﬁed, so that C0 is generated under κ-ﬁltered colimits by a small
subcategory D ⊆ C0. Choose τ ≫ κ large enough that every object of D is τ -compact. Enlarging τ if
necessary, we may suppose that τ > κ. We claim that (2′
τ ) is satisﬁed. To prove this, we consider any
system of morphisms {X}α∈A satisfying the hypotheses of (5′
τ ). In particular, XA belongs to C0, so that XA
may be obtained in some other way as a κ-ﬁltered colimit of a system {Yβ}β∈B, where each of the objects Yβ
belongs to D and is therefore τ -compact. Let C′ denote the family of all τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subsets B0 ⊆ B.
Replacing B by B′ and the family {Yβ}β∈B by {YB0}B0∈B′ , we may assume that B is τ -ﬁltered.

Let A0 ⊆ A be a τ -small subset. Applying Lemma A.2.6.4 to the diagram category C, we deduce that
A0 ⊆ A′, where A′ is a τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subset of A, and there is an isomorphism XA′ ≃ YB′ ; here B′
is a κ-ﬁltered subset of B, so that YB′ ∈ C0 in virtue of our assumption that C0 is stable under κ-ﬁltered
colimits.

Corollary A.2.6.5. Let f : C → D be a functor between presentable categories which preserves κ-ﬁltered
colimits, and let D0 ⊆ D be a κ-accessible subcategory. Then f −1 D0 ⊆ C is a κ-accessible subcategory.

Corollary A.2.6.6 (Smith). Let A be a combinatorial model category, let A[1] be the category of morphisms
in A, let W ⊆ A[1] be the full subcategory spanned by the weak equivalences, and let F ⊆ A[1] be the full
subcategory spanned by the ﬁbrations. Then F , W , and F ∩ W are accessible subcategories of A[1].

Proof. For every morphism i : A → B, let Fi : A[1] → Set[1] be the functor which carries a morphism
f : X → Y to the induced map of sets

HomA(B, X) → HomA(B, Y ) ×HomA(A,Y ) HomA(A, X).

We observe that if A and B are κ-compact objects of A, then Fi preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits.

Let C0 be the full subcategory of Set[1] spanned by the collection of surjective maps between sets. It is easy
i C0 ⊆ A[1]

to see that C0 is an accessible category of Set[1]. It follows that the full subcategories R(i) = F −1
are accessible subcategories of A[1] (Corollary A.2.6.5).

Let I be a set of generating coﬁbrations for A, and J a set of generating trivial coﬁbrations. Then

Proposition 5.4.7.10 implies that the subcategories

F =

R(j)

\j∈J

W ∩ F =

R(i)

\i∈I

are accessible subcategories of A[1].

Applying Proposition A.1.2.5, we deduce that there exists a pair of functors T ′, T ′′ : A[1] → A[1], which

carry an arbitrary morphism f : X → Z to a factorization

T ′(f )
→ Y

T ′′(f )

→ Z

X

where T ′(f ) is a trivial coﬁbration, and T ′′(f ) is a ﬁbration. Moreover, the functor T ′′ can be chosen to
commute with κ-ﬁltered colimits, for a suﬃciently large regular cardinal κ. We now observe that W is the
inverse image of F ∩ W under the functor T ′′ : A[1] → A[1], and is therefore an accessible subcategory of
A[1] by Corollary A.2.6.5.

647

Our next goal is to prove a converse to Corollary A.2.6.6, which will allow us to construct examples of

combinatorial model categories. First, we need the following preliminary result.

Lemma A.2.6.7. Let A be a presentable category. Suppose W and C are collections of morphisms of A
with the following properties:

(1) The collection C is a weakly saturated class of morphisms of A, and there exists a (small) subset

C0 ⊆ C which generates C as a weakly saturated class of morphisms.

(2) The intersection C ∩ W is a weakly saturated class of morphisms of A.

(3) The full subcategory W ⊆ A[1] is an accessible subcategory of A[1].

(4) The class W has the two-out-of-three property.

Then C ∩ W is generated, as a weakly saturated class of morphisms, by a (small) subset S ⊆ C ∩ W .

Proof. Let κ be a regular cardinal such that W is κ-accessible. Choose a regular cardinal τ ≫ κ such that
W satisﬁes condition (2′
τ ) of Proposition A.2.6.3. Enlarging τ if necessary, we may assume that τ > κ (so
that τ is uncountable), that C is τ -accessible, and that the source and target of every morphism in C0 is
τ -compact. Enlarging C0 if necessary, we may suppose that C0 consists of all morphisms f : X → Y in C
such that X and Y are τ -compact. Let S = C0 ∩ W . We will show that S generates C ∩ W as a weakly
saturated class of morphisms.

Let S be the weakly saturated class of morphisms generated by S, and let f : X → Y be a morphism
which belongs to C ∩ W . We wish to show that f ∈ S. Corollary A.1.5.13 implies that there exists a τ -good
C0-tree {Yα}α∈A with root X, such that Y is isomorphic to YA as objects of CX/. Let us say that a subset
B ⊆ A is good if it is closed downwards and the canonical map i : X → YB belongs to W (we note that i
automatically belongs to C, in virtue of Lemma A.1.5.6).

We now make the following observations:

(i) Given an increasing transﬁnite sequence of good subsets {Aγ}γ<β, the union

Aγ is good. This follows

from the assumption that C ∩ W is weakly saturated.

S

(ii) Let B ⊆ A be good, and let B0 ⊆ B be τ -small. Then there exists a τ -small subset B′ ⊆ B containing

B0. This follows from our assumption that W satisﬁes condition (2′

τ ) of Proposition A.2.6.3.

(iii) Suppose that B, B′ ⊆ A are such that B, B′, and B ∩ B′ are good. Then B ∪ B′ is good. To prove

this, we consider the pushout diagram

YB∩B′

YB

YB′

/ YB∪B′.

Every morphism in this diagram belongs to C (Lemma A.1.5.6), and the upper horizontal map belongs
to W in virtue of assumption (4). Since C ∩ W is stable under pushouts, we conclude that the lower
vertical map belongs to W . Assumption (4) now implies that the composite map X → YB′ → YB∪B′
belongs to W , as desired.

The next step is to prove the following claim:

(∗) Let A′ be a good subset of A, and let B0 ⊆ A be τ -small. Then there exists a τ -small subset B ⊆ A

such that B0 ⊆ B, B is good, and B ∩ A′ is good.

648

/
/
(cid:15)
(cid:15)
(cid:15)
(cid:15)

To prove (∗), we begin by setting B′

0 = A′ ∩ B0. We now deﬁne sequences of τ -small subsets

B0 ⊆ B1 ⊆ B2 ⊆ . . .

B′

0 ⊆ B′

1 ⊆ B′

2 ⊆ . . .

as follows. Suppose that Bi and B′
subset of A which contains Bi ∪ B′
which contains A′ ∩ Bi+1. Let B =

i have been deﬁned. Applying (ii), we choose Bi+1 to be any τ -small good
i+1 to be any τ -small good subset of A′
i. Applying (ii) again, we select B′
i B′

Bi. It follows from (i) that B and A′ ∩ B =

i are both good.

We now choose a transﬁnite sequence of good subsets {A(γ) ⊆ A}γ<β. Suppose that A(γ′) has been
S
γ′<γ A(γ′). It follows from (i) that A′(γ) is good. If A′(γ) = A, we set
deﬁned for γ′ < γ, and let A′(γ) =
β = γ and conclude the construction. Otherwise, choose a minimal element a ∈ A − A′(γ). Applying (∗),
we deduce that there exists a τ -small good subset B(γ) ⊆ A containing a, such that A′(γ) ∩ B(γ) is good.
Let A(γ) = A′(γ) ∪ B(γ). It follows from (iii) that A(γ) is good.

S

S

We observe that {YA(γ)}γ<β is a transﬁnite sequence of objects of CX/ having colimit Y . To prove that
f : X → Y belongs to S, it will suﬃce to show that for each γ < β, the map g : YA′(γ) → YA(γ) belongs to
S. Remark A.1.5.5 implies the existence of a C0-tree {Zα}α∈A(γ)−A′(γ) with root YA′(γ) and colimit YA(γ).
Since A(γ) − A′(γ) is τ -small, Lemma A.1.5.11 implies the existence of a pushout diagram

M

N

YA′(γ)

/ YA(γ)

where g ∈ C0.

Since C is τ -accessible, we can write YA′(γ) as the colimit of a family of τ -compact objects {Zλ}λ∈P ,
indexed by a τ -ﬁltered partially ordered set P . Since M is τ -compact, we can assume (reindexing the colimit
M N
if necessary) that we have a compatible family of maps {M → Zλ}. For each λ, let gλ : Zλ → Zλ
be the induced map. Then g is the ﬁltered colimit of the family {gλ}λ∈P . Since W satisﬁes condition
(2′
τ ) of Proposition A.2.6.3, we conclude that there exists a τ -small, κ-ﬁltered subset P0 ⊆ P , such that
g′ = lim
gλ belongs to W . We now observe that g′ ∈ S, and that g is a pushout of g′, so that g ∈ S as
desired.

Proposition A.2.6.8. Let A be a presentable category, and let W and C be classes of morphisms in A
with the following properties:

(1) The collection C is a weakly saturated class of morphisms of A, and there exists a (small) subset

C0 ⊆ C which generates C as a weakly saturated class of morphisms.

(2) The intersection C ∩ W is a weakly saturated class of morphisms of A.

(3) The full subcategory W ⊆ A[1] is an accessible subcategory of A[1].

(4) The class W has the two-out-of-three property.

(5) If f is a morphism in A which has the right lifting property with respect to each element of C, then

f ∈ W .

Then A admits a combinatorial model structure, which may be described as follows:

(C) The coﬁbrations in A are the elements of C.

(W ) The weak equivalences in A are the elements of W .

(F ) A morphism in A is a ﬁbration if it has the right lifting property with respect to every morphism in

C ∩ W .

Proof. The category A has all (small) limits and colimits, since it is presentable. The two-out-three property
for W is among our assumptions, and the stability of W under retracts follows from the accessibility of
W ⊆ A[1] (Corollary 4.4.5.16). The class of coﬁbrations is stable under retracts by (1), and the class of
ﬁbrations is stable under retracts by deﬁnition. The classes of ﬁbrations and coﬁbrations are stable under
retracts by deﬁnition.

We next establish the factorization axioms. By the small object argument, any morphism X → Z admits

a factorization

X

f
→ Y

g
→ Z

where f ∈ C and g has the right lifting property with respect to every morphism in C. In particular, g has
the right lifting property with respect to every morphism in C ∩ W , so that g is a ﬁbration; assumption (5)
then implies that g is a trivial ﬁbration. Similarly, using Lemma A.2.6.7 we may choose a factorization as
above where f ∈ C ∩ W and g has the right lifting property with respect to C ∩ W ; g is then a ﬁbration by
deﬁnition.

To complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that coﬁbrations have the left lifting property with respect to
trivial ﬁbrations, and trivial coﬁbrations have the left lifting property with respect to ﬁbrations. The second
of these statements is clear (it is the deﬁnition of a ﬁbration). For the ﬁrst statement, let us consider an
arbitrary trivial ﬁbration p : X → Z. By the small object argument, there exists a factorization of p

X

q
→ Y r→ Z

where q is a coﬁbration, and r has the right lifting property with respect to all coﬁbrations. Then r is a
weak equivalence by (3), so that q is a weak equivalence by the two-out-of-three property. Considering the
diagram

X

~

q
~

~
r

Y

X

>~

p

Z,

we deduce the existence of the dotted arrow from the fact that p is a ﬁbration and q is a trivial coﬁbration.
It follows that p is a retract of r, and therefore p also has the right lifting property with respect to all
coﬁbrations. This completes the proof that A is a model category. The assertion that A is combinatorial
follows immediately from (1) and from Lemma A.2.6.7.

Corollary A.2.6.9. Let A be a presentable category equipped with a model structure. Suppose that there
exists a (small) set which generates the collection of coﬁbrations in A (as a weakly saturated class of
morphisms). Then the following are equivalent:

(1) The model category A is combinatorial; in other words, there exists a (small) set which generates the

collection of trivial coﬁbrations in A (as a weakly saturated class of morphisms).

(2) The collection of weak equivalences in A determines an accessible subcategory of A[1].

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) follows from Corollary A.2.6.6, and the reverse implication follows from
Proposition A.2.6.8.

Our next goal is to prove a weaker version of Proposition A.2.6.8 which is somewhat easier to apply in

practice.

Deﬁnition A.2.6.10. Let A be a presentable category. A class W of morphisms in C is perfect if it satisﬁes
the following conditions:

(1) Every isomorphism belongs to W .

(2) Given a pair of composable morphisms X
belong to W , then so does the third.

f
→ Y

g
→ Z, if any two of the morphisms f , g, and g ◦ f

(3) The class W is stable under ﬁltered colimits. More precisely, suppose given a family of morphisms
{fα : Xα → Yα} which is indexed by a ﬁltered partially ordered set. Let X denote a colimit of {Xα}
and Y a colimit of {Yα}, and f : X → Y the induced map. If each fα belongs to W , then so does f .

(4) There exists a (small) subset W0 ⊆ W such that every morphism belonging to W can be obtained as

a ﬁltered colimit of morphisms belonging to W0.

Example A.2.6.11. If C is a presentable category, then the class W consisting of all isomorphisms in C is
perfect.

The following is an immediate consequence of Corollary A.2.6.5:

Corollary A.2.6.12. Let F : C → C′ be a functor between presentable categories which preserves ﬁltered
colimits, and let WC′ be a perfect class of morphisms in C′. Then WC = F −1WC′ is a perfect class of
morphisms in C.

Proposition A.2.6.13. Let A be a presentable category. Suppose given a class W of morphisms of C,
which we will call weak equivalences, and a (small) set C0 of morphisms of C, which we will call generating
coﬁbrations. Suppose furthermore that the following assumptions are satisﬁed:

(1) The class W of weak equivalences is perfect (Deﬁnition A.2.6.10).

(2) For any diagram

X

f

Y

X ′

g

X ′′

Y ′

g′

/ Y ′′

in which both squares are coCartesian, f belongs to C0, and g belongs to W , the map g′ also belongs
to W .

(3) If g : X → Y is a morphism in A which has the right lifting property with respect to every morphism

in C0, then g belongs to W .

Then there exists a left proper, combinatorial model structure on C which may be described as follows:

(C) A morphism f : X → Y in A is a coﬁbration if it belongs to the weakly saturated class of morphisms

generated by C0.

(W ) A morphism f : X → Y in C is a weak equivalence if it belongs to W .

(F ) A morphism f : X → Y in C is a ﬁbration if it has the right lifting property with respect to every map

which is both a coﬁbration and a weak equivalence.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that the class of weak equivalences is stable under pushouts by coﬁbrations. Let P
denote the collection of all morphisms f in A with the following property: for coCartesian diagram

X

f

X ′

g

X ′′

where g belongs to W , the map g′ also belongs to W . By assumption, C0 ⊆ P . It is easy to see that P is
weakly saturated (using the stability of W under ﬁltered colimits), so that every coﬁbration belongs to P .
It remains only to show that A is a model category. In view of Proposition A.2.6.8, it will suﬃce to show
that C ∩ W is a weakly saturated class of morphisms. It is clear that C ∩ W is stable under retracts. It will
therefore suﬃce to verify the stability of C ∩ W under pushouts and transﬁnite composition. The case of
transﬁnite composition is easy: C is stable under transﬁnite composition because C is weakly saturated, and
W is stable under transﬁnite composition because it is stable under ﬁnite composition and ﬁltered colimits.

It remains to show that C ∩ W is stable under pushouts. Suppose given a coCartesian diagram

X

f

Y

/ X ′′

f ′′

/ Y ′′

in which f belongs to C ∩ W ; we wish to show that f ′′ also belongs to C ∩ W . Since C is weakly saturated, it
will suﬃce to show that f ′′ belongs to W . Using the small object argument, we can factor the top horizontal
map to produce a coCartesian rectangle

X

f

g

h /

/ X ′′

f ′

f ′′

/ Y ′

h′

/ Y ′′

in which g is a coﬁbration and h has the right lifting property with respect to all the morphisms in C0. Since
W is stable under the formation of pushouts by coﬁbrations, we deduce that f ′ belongs to W . Moreover, by
assumption (3), h belongs to W . Since h′ is a pushout of h by the coﬁbration f ′, we deduce that h′ belongs
to W as well. Applying the two-out-of-three property (twice), we deduce that f ′′ belongs to W .

Remark A.2.6.14. Let A be a model category. Then A arises via the construction of Proposition A.2.6.13
if and only if it is combinatorial, left proper, and the collection of weak equivalences in A is stable under
ﬁltered colimits.

A.2.7 Simplicial Sets

The formalism of simplicial sets plays a prominent role throughout this book. In this section, we will review
the deﬁnition of a simplicial set, and establish some notation.

For each n ≥ 0, we let [n] denote the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , n}. We let ∆ denote the category of
combinatorial simplices: the objects of ∆ are the linearly ordered sets [n], and morphisms in ∆ are given
by (nonstrictly) order-preserving maps.

If C is any category, a simplicial object of C is a functor ∆op → C. Dually, a cosimplicial object of C is a
functor ∆ → C. A simplicial set is a simplicial object in the category of sets. More explicitly, a simplicial
set S is determined by the following data:

• A set Sn for each n ≥ 0 (the value of S on the object [n] ∈ ∆).

• A map p∗ : Sn → Sm for each order-preserving map [m] → [n], the formation of which is compatible

with composition (including empty composition, so that (id[n])∗ = idSn).

Let recall a bit of standard notation for working with a simplicial set S. For each 0 ≤ j ≤ n, the face

map dj : Sn → Sn−1 is deﬁned to be the pullback p∗, where p : [n − 1] → [n] is given by

p(i) =

i
if i < j
i + 1 if i ≥ j.

(

Similarly, the degeneracy map sj : Sn → Sn+1 is deﬁned to be the pullback q∗, where q : [n + 1] → [n] is
deﬁned by the formula

q(i) =

i
if i ≤ j
i − 1 if i > j.

(

Because every order-preserving map from [n] to [m] can be factored as a composition of face and degeneracy
maps, the structure of a simplicial set S is completely determined by the sets Sn for n ≥ 0, together with
the face and degeneracy operations deﬁned above. These operations are required to satisfy certain identities,
which we will not make explicit here.

Remark A.2.7.1. The category ∆ is equivalent to the (larger) category of all ﬁnite, nonempty linearly
ordered sets. We will sometimes abuse notation by identifying ∆ with this larger subcategory, and regarding
simplicial sets (or more general simplicial objects) as functors which are deﬁned on all nonempty linearly
ordered sets.

Notation A.2.7.2. The category of simplicial sets will be denoted by Set∆. If J is a linearly ordered set,
we let ∆J ∈ Set∆ denote the representable functor [n] 7→ Hom([n], J), where the morphisms are taken in
the category of linearly ordered sets. For each n ≥ 0, we will write ∆n in place of ∆[n]. We observe that,
for any simplicial set S, there is a natural identiﬁcation of sets Sn ≃ HomSet∆ (∆n, S).

Example A.2.7.3. For 0 ≤ j ≤ n, we let Λn

subset of ∆J obtained by removing the interior and the “opposite face” to the vertex j.

j denote the simplicial

The category Set∆ of simplicial sets has a (combinatorial, left and right proper) model structure, which

we will refer to as the Kan model structure. It may be described as follows:

• A map of simplicial sets f : X → Y is a coﬁbration if it is a monomorphism; that is, if the induced

map Xn → Yn is injective for all n ≥ 0.

• A map of simplicial sets f : X → Y is a ﬁbration if it is a Kan ﬁbration; that is, if for any diagram

To prove this, we observe that the class of all coﬁbrations is generated by the collection of all inclusions
∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n; it is then easy to see that the conditions of Proposition A.2.6.13 are satisﬁed. The nontrivial
point is to verify that the ﬁbrations for the resulting model structure are precisely the Kan ﬁbrations, and
that Set∆ is right proper; these facts ultimately rely on a delicate analysis due to Quillen (see [32]).

Remark A.2.7.4. In §2.2.5, we introduce another model structure on Set∆, the Joyal model structure. This
model structure has the same class of coﬁbrations, but the ﬁbrations and the weak equivalences diﬀer from
those deﬁned in this section. To avoid confusion, we will refer to the ﬁbrations and weak equivalences for
the usual model structure on simplicial sets as Kan ﬁbrations and weak homotopy equivalences, respectively.

A.2.8 Diagram Categories and Homotopy (Co)limits

Let A be a combinatorial model category and C a small category. We let Fun(C, A) denote the category of all
functors from C to A. In this section, we will see that Fun(C, A) again admits the structure of a combinatorial
model category: in fact, it admits two such structures. Moreover, by considering the functoriality of this
construction in the category C, we will obtain the theory of homotopy limits and homotopy colimits.

Deﬁnition A.2.8.1. Let C be a small category, and A a model category. A natural transformation α : F →
G in Fun(C, A) is a:

• injective coﬁbration if the induced map F (C) → G(C) is a coﬁbration in A, for each C ∈ C.

• projective ﬁbration if the induced map F (C) → G(C) is a ﬁbration in A, for each C ∈ C.

• weak equivalence if the induced map F (C) → G(C) is a weak equivalence in A, for each C ∈ C.

• injective ﬁbration if it has the right lifting property with respect to every morphism β in Fun(C, A)

which is simultaneously a weak equivalence and a injective coﬁbration.

• projective coﬁbration if it has the left lifting property with respect to every morphism β in Fun(C, A)

which is simultaneously a weak equivalence and a projective ﬁbration.

Proposition A.2.8.2. Let A be a combinatorial model category and C be a small category. Then there exist
two combinatorial model structures on Fun(C, A):

• The projective model structure, determined by the strong coﬁbrations, weak equivalences, and projective

ﬁbrations.

• The injective model structure, determined by the weak coﬁbrations, weak equivalences, and injective

ﬁbrations.

The following is the key step in the proof of Proposition A.3.3.2:

Lemma A.2.8.3. Let A be a presentable category, and C a small category. Let S0 be a (small) set of
morphisms of A, and let S0 be the weakly saturated class of morphisms generated by S0. Let
S be the
collection of all morphisms F → G in Fun(C, A) with the following property:
for every C ∈ C, the map
F (C) → G(C) belongs to S0. Then there exists a (small) set of morphisms S of Fun(C, A) which generates
S as a weakly saturated class of morphisms.

We will prove a generalization of Lemma A.2.8.3 in §A.3.3 (Lemma A.3.3.3).

Proof of Proposition A.2.8.2. We ﬁrst treat the case of the projective model structure. For each For each
object C ∈ C and each A ∈ A, we deﬁne

We note that if i : A → A′ is a (trivial) coﬁbration in A, then the induced map FC
(trivial) coﬁbration in Fun(C, A).

A → FC

A′ is a strong

Let I0 be a set of generating coﬁbrations i : A → B for A, and let I be the set of all induced maps
A → FC
FC
B (where C ranges over C. Let J0 be a set of generating trivial coﬁbrations for A, and deﬁne J
likewise. It follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that a morphism in Fun(C, A) is a projective ﬁbration if
and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to every morphism in J, and a weak trivial ﬁbration
if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to every morphism in I. Let I and J be the
weakly saturated classes of morphisms of Fun(C, A) generated by I and J, respectively. Using the small
object argument, we deduce:

(i) Every morphism f : X → Z in Fun(C, A) admits a factorization

where f ′ ∈ I and f ′′ is a weak trivial ﬁbration.

(ii) Every morphism f : X → Z in Fun(C, A) admits a factorization

f ′
→ Y

f ′′

f ′

f ′′

where f ′ ∈ J and f ′′ is a projective ﬁbration.

(iii) The class I coincides with the class of projective coﬁbrations in A.

Furthermore, since the class of trivial projective coﬁbrations in Fun(C, A) is weakly saturated and contains
J, it contains J. This proves that Fun(C, A) satisﬁes the factorization axioms. The only other nontrivial
point to check is that Fun(C, A) satisﬁes the lifting axioms. Consider a diagram

in Fun(C, A), where i is a projective coﬁbration and p is a projective ﬁbration. We wish to show that there
exists a dotted arrow as indicated, provided that either i or p is a weak equivalence. If p is a weak equivalence
then this follows immediately from the deﬁnition of a injective ﬁbration. Suppose instead that i is a trivial
projective coﬁbration. We wish to show that i has the left lifting property with respect to every projective
ﬁbration. It will suﬃce to show every trivial injective ﬁbration belongs to J (this will also show that J is a
set of generating trivial coﬁbrations for Fun(C, A), which will show that the projective model structure on
Fun(C, A) is combinatorial). Suppose then that i is a trivial weak coibration, and choose a factorization

where i′ ∈ J and i′′ is a projective ﬁbration. Then i′ is a weak equivalence, so that i′′ is a weak equivalence
by the two-out-of-three property. Consider the diagram

therefore belongs to J as desired.

We now prove the existence of the injective model structure on Fun(C, A). Here it is diﬃcult to proceed
directly, so we will instead apply Proposition A.2.6.8. It will suﬃce to check each of the hypotheses in turn:

(1) The collection of injective coﬁbrations in Fun(C, A) is generated (as a weakly saturated class) by some

small set of morphisms. This follows from Lemma A.3.3.3.

(2) The collection of trivial injective coﬁbrations in Fun(C, A) is weakly saturated: this follows immediately

from the fact that the class of injective coﬁbrations in A is weakly saturated.

(3) The collection of weak equivalences in Fun(C, A) is an accessible subcategory of Fun(C, A)[1]: this
follows from the proof of Proposition 5.4.4.3, since the collection of weak equivalences in A form an
accessible subcategory of A[1].

(4) The collection of weak equivalences in Fun(C, A) satisfy the two-out-of-three property: this follows
immediately from the fact that the weak equivalences in A satisfy the two-out-of-three property.

(5) Let f : X → Y be a morphism in A which has the right lifting property with respect to every injective
coﬁbration. In particular, f has the right lifting property with respect to each of the morphisms in the
class I deﬁned above, so that f is a trivial projective ﬁbration, and in particular a weak equivalence.

Remark A.2.8.4. In the situation of Proposition A.2.8.2, if A is assumed to be right or left proper,
then Fun(C, A) is likewise right or left proper (with respect to either the projective or the injective model
structures).

Remark A.2.8.5. It follows from the proof of Proposition A.3.3.2 that the class of projective coﬁbrations is
generated (as a weakly saturated class of morphisms) by the maps j : FC
A′, where C ∈ C and A → A′
is a coﬁbration in A. We observe that j is a injective coﬁbration. It follows that every projective coﬁbration
is a injective coﬁbration; dually, every injective ﬁbration is a projective ﬁbration.

A → FC

Remark A.2.8.6. The construction of Proposition A.2.8.2 is functorial in the following sense: given a

Quillen adjunction of combinatorial model categories A

F and G determines a Quillen adjunction

F

G

/B

and a small category C, composition with

Fun(C, A)

F C

GC

/ Fun(C, B)

(with respect to either the injective or the projective model structures). Moreover, if (F, G) is a Quillen
equivalence, then so is (F C, GC).

Because the projective and injective model structures on Fun(C, A) have the same weak equivalences,
the identity functor idFun(C,A) is a Quillen equivalence between them. However, it is important to keep
distinguish these two model structures, because they have diﬀerent variance properties as we now explain.
Let f : C → C′ be a functor between small categories. Then composition with f yields a pullback functor
f ∗ : Fun(C′, A) → Fun(C, A). Since A admits small limits and colimits, f ∗ has a right adjoint which we
shall denote by f∗ and a left adjoint which we shall denote by f!.

Proposition A.2.8.7. Let A be a combinatorial model category, and let f : C → C′ be a functor between
small categories. Then:

(1) The pair (f!, f ∗) determines a Quillen adjunction between the projective model structures on Fun(C, A)

and Fun(C′, A).

(2) The pair (f ∗, f∗) determines a Quillen adjunction between the injective model structures on Fun(C, A)

and Fun(C′, A).

Proof. This follows immediately from the simple observation that f ∗ preserves weak equivalences, projective
ﬁbrations, and weak coﬁbrations.

We now review the theory of homotopy limits and colimits in a combinatorial model category A. For
simplicity, we will discuss homotopy limits and leave the analogous theory of homotopy colimits to the reader.
Let A be a combinatorial model category, and let f : C → C′ be functor betweeen (small) categories. We
wish to consider the right-derived functor Rf∗ of the right Kan extension f∗ : Fun(C, A) → Fun(C′, A). This
derived functor is called the homotopy right Kan extension functor. The usual way of deﬁning it involves
choosing a “ﬁbrant replacement functor” Q : Fun(C, A) → Fun(C, A), and setting Rf∗ = f∗ ◦ Q. The
assumption that A is combinatorial guarantees that such a ﬁbrant replacement functor exists. However, for
our purposes it is more convenient to address the indeterminacy in the deﬁnition of Rf∗ in another way.

Let F ∈ Fun(C, A), G ∈ Fun(C′, A), and let η : G → f∗F be a map in Fun(C′, A). We will say that
η exhibits G as the homotopy right Kan extension of F if, for some weak equivalence F → F ′ where F ′ is
injectively ﬁbrant in Fun(C, A), the composite map G → f∗F → f∗F ′ is a weak equivalence in Fun(C′, A).
Since f∗ preserves weak equivalences between injectively ﬁbrant objects, this condition is independent of the
choice of F ′.

Remark A.2.8.8. Given an object F ∈ Fun(C, A), it is not necessarily the case that there exists a map
η : G → f∗F which exhibits G as a homotopy right Kan extension of F . However, such a map can always be
found after replacing F by a weakly equivalent object; for example, if F is injectively ﬁbrant, we may take
G = f∗F and η to be the identity map.

Let [0] denote the ﬁnal object of Cat: that is, the category with one object and only the identity morphism.
For any category C, there is a unique functor f : C → [0]. If A is a combinatorial model category, F : C → A
a functor, and A ∈ A ≃ Fun([0], A) is an object, then we will say that a natural transformation α : f ∗A → F
exhibits A as a homotopy limit of F if it exhibits A as a homotopy right Kan extension of F . Note that we
can identify α with a map A → limC∈C F (C) in the model category A.

The theory of homotopy right Kan extensions in general can be reduced to the theory of homotopy limits,

in view of the following result:

Proposition A.2.8.9. Let A be a combinatorial model category, let f : C → D be a functor between small
categories, and let F : C → A and G : D → A be diagrams. A natural transformation α : f ∗G → F exhibits
G as a homotopy right Kan extension of F if and only if, for each object D ∈ D, α exhibits G(D) as a
homotopy limit of the composite diagram

FD/ : C ×D DD/ → C F→ A.

To prove Proposition A.2.8.9, we can immediately reduce to the case where F is a injectively ﬁbrant
diagram. In this case, α exhibits G as a homotopy right Kan extension of F if and only if it induces a weak
homotopy equivalence G(D) → lim FD/, for each D ∈ D. It will therefore suﬃce to prove the following result
(in the case C′ = C ×D DD/):

Lemma A.2.8.10. Let A be a combinatorial model category and g : C′ → C a functor which exhibits C′ as
coﬁbered in sets over C. Then the pullback functor g∗ : Fun(C, A) → Fun(C′, A) preserves injective ﬁbrations.

Proof. It will suﬃce to show that the left adjoint g! preserves weak trivial coﬁbrations. Let α : F → F ′ be
a map in Fun(C′, A). We observe that for each object C ∈ C, the map (q!α)(C) : (q!F )(C) → (q!F ′)(C) can
be identiﬁed with the coproduct of the maps {α(C′) : F (C′) → F ′(C′)}C ′∈g−1{C}. If α is a weak trivial
coﬁbration, then each of these maps is a trivial coﬁbration in A, so that q!α is again a weak trivial coﬁbration
as desired.

657

Remark A.2.8.11. In the preceding discussion, we considered injective model structures, Rf∗, and homo-
topy limits. An entirely dual discussion may be carried out with projective model structures and Lf!; one
obtains a notion of homotopy colimit which is the dual of the notion of homotopy limit.

Example A.2.8.12. Let A be a combinatorial model category, and consider a diagram

X ′ f

← X

g
→ X ′′.

This diagram is projectively coﬁbrant if and only if the object X is coﬁbrant, and the maps f and g are
both coﬁbrations. Consequently, the deﬁnition of homotopy colimits given above recovers, as a special case,
the theory of homotopy pushouts presented in §A.2.4.

A.2.9 Reedy Model Structures

Let A be a combinatorial model category and J a small category. In §A.2.8, we saw that the diagram category
Fun(J, A) can again be regarded as a combinatorial model category, via either the projective or injective
In the special case where J is a Reedy category (see Deﬁnition
model structure of Proposition A.2.8.2.
A.2.9.1), it is often useful to consider still another model structure on Fun(J, A): the Reedy model structure.
We will sketch the deﬁnition and some of the basic properties of Reedy model categories below; we refer the
reader to [38] for a more detailed treatment.
Deﬁnition A.2.9.1. A Reedy category is a small category J equipped with a factorization system JL, JR ⊆ J
satisfying the following conditions:

(1) Every isomorphism in J is an identity map.

(2) Given a pair of object X, Y ∈ J, let us write X (cid:22)0 Y if either there exists a morphism f : X → Y
belonging to JR or there exists a morphism g : Y → X belonging to JL. We will write X ≺0 Y if
X (cid:22)0 Y and X 6= Y . Then there are no inﬁnite descending chains

. . . ≺0 X2 ≺0 X1 ≺0 X0.

Remark A.2.9.2. Let J be a category equipped with a factorization system (JL, JR), and let (cid:22)0 be the
relation described in Deﬁnition A.2.9.1. This relation is generally not transitive. We will denote its transitive
closure by (cid:22). Then condition (2) of Deﬁnition A.2.9.1 guarantees that (cid:22) is a well-founded partial ordering
on the set of objects of J. In other words, every nonempty set S of objects of J contains a (cid:22)-minimal element.

Remark A.2.9.3. In the situation of Deﬁnition A.2.9.1, we will often abuse terminology and simply refer
to J as a Reedy category, implicitly assuming that a factorization system on J has been speciﬁed as well.

Warning A.2.9.4. Condition (1) of Deﬁnition A.2.9.1 is not stable under equivalence of categories. Suppose
that J is equivalent to a Reedy category. Then J can itself be regarded as a Reedy category if and only if
every isomorphism class of objects in J contains a unique representative. (Deﬁnition A.2.9.1 can easily be
modiﬁed so as to be invariant under equivalence, but it is slightly more convenient not to do so.)

Example A.2.9.5. The category ∆ of combinatorial simplices is a Reedy category with respect to the
factorization system (∆L, ∆R); here a morphism f : [m] → [n] belongs to ∆L if and only if f is surjective,
and to ∆R if and only if f is injective.
Example A.2.9.6. Let J be a Reedy category with respect to the factorization system (JL, JR). Then Jop
is a Reedy category with respect to the factorization system ((JR)op, (JL)op).

Notation A.2.9.7. Let J be a Reedy category, C a category which admits small limits and colimits, and
X : J → C a functor. For every object J ∈ J, we deﬁne the latching object LJ (X) to be the colimit

lim
−→
/J ,J ′6=J

J ′∈JR

X(J ′).

658

Similarly, we deﬁne the matching object to be the limit

lim
←−
J/,J ′6=J

J ′∈JL

X(J ′).

We then have canonical maps LJ (X) → X(J) → MJ (X).

Example A.2.9.8. Let X : ∆op → Set be a simplicial set, and regard ∆op as a Reedy category using
Examples A.2.9.5 and A.2.9.6. For every nonnegative integer n, the latching object L[n]X can be identiﬁed
with the collection of all degenerate simplices of X. In particular, the map L[n](X) → X([n]) is always a
monomorphism.

More generally, we observe that a map of simplicial sets f : X → Y is a monomorphism if and only if,

for every n ≥ 0, the map

L[n](Y )

X([n]) → Y ([n])

aL[n](X)

is a monomorphism of sets. The “if” direction is obvious. For the converse, let us suppose that f is a
monomorphism; we must show that if σ is an n-simplex of X such that f (σ) is degenerate, then σ is already
degenerate. If f (σ) is degenerate, then f (σ) = α∗f (σ) = f (α∗σ) where α : [n] → [n] is a map of linearly
ordered sets other than the identity. Since f is a monomorphism, we deduce that σ = α∗σ, so that σ is
degenerate as desired.

Remark A.2.9.9. Let X : J → C be as in Notation A.2.9.7. Then the Jth matching object MJ (X) can be
identiﬁed with the Jth latching object of the induced functor X op : Jop → Cop.

Remark A.2.9.10. Let X : J → C be as in Notation A.2.9.7. Then the Jth matching object MJ (X) can
also be identiﬁed with the colimit

lim
−→
(f :J ′→J)∈S

X(J ′)

where S is any full subcategory of J/J with the following properties:

(1) Every morphism f : J ′ → J which belongs to JR and is not an isomorphism also belongs to S.

(2) If f : J ′ → J belongs to S, then J (cid:14) J ′.

This follows from a coﬁnality argument, since every morphism f : J ′ → J in S admits a canonical factoriza-
tion

→ J ′′ f ′′
where f ′ belongs to JL and f ′′ belongs to JR. Assumption (2) guarantees that the map f ′′ is not an
isomorphism.

Similarly, we can replace the limit lim
a slightly larger category, when convenient.

Notation A.2.9.11. Let J be a Reedy category. A good ﬁltration of J is a transﬁnite sequence

of full subcategories of J with the following properties:

{Jβ}β<α

(a) The ﬁltration is exhaustive in the following sense: every object of J belongs to Jβ for suﬃciently large

β < α.

(b) For each ordinal β < α, the category Jβ is obtained from the subcategory J<β =

γ<β Jγ by adjoining

a single new object Jβ satisfying the following condition: if J ∈ J satisﬁes J ≺ Jβ, then J ∈ J<β.

S

659

Remark A.2.9.12. Let J be a Reedy category. Then there exists a good ﬁltration of J. In fact, the existence
of a good ﬁltration is equivalent to the second assumption of Deﬁnition A.2.9.1.
Remark A.2.9.13. Let J be a Reedy category with respect to the factorization system (JL, JR), and let
{Jβ}β<α be a good ﬁltration of J. Then each Jβ admits a factorization system (JL ∩ Jβ, JR ∩ Jβ). In other
words, if f : I → K is a morphism in Jβ which admits a factorization

f ′
→ J

f ′′
→ K

I

where f ′ belongs to JL and f ′′ belongs to JR, then the object J also belongs to Jβ. This is clear: either
f ′′ is an isomorphism, in which case J = K ∈ Jβ, or f ′′ is not an isomorphism so that J ≺ K implies that
J ∈ J<β.

The following result summarizes the essential features of a good ﬁltration:

Proposition A.2.9.14. Let J be a Reedy category with a good ﬁltration {Jβ}β<α, let β < α be an ordinal,
so that Jβ is obtained from J<β by adjoining a single new object J. Then we have a homotopy pushout square
(with respect to the Joyal model structure)

N(J<β)/J ⋆ N(J<β)J/

/ N(J<β)

N(J<β)/J ⋆ {J} ⋆ N(J<β)J/

/ N(Jβ).

Corollary A.2.9.15. Let J be a Reedy category with a good ﬁltration {Jβ}β<α, let β < α be an ordinal, so
that Jβ is obtained from J<β by adjoining a single new object J. Let C be a category which admits small
limits and colimits, and let X : J<β → C be a functor, and let the latching and matching objects LJ (X) and
MJ (X) be deﬁned as in Notation A.2.9.7 (note that this does not require that the functor X be deﬁned on
the object J), so that we have a canonical map α : LJ (X) → MJ (X). The following data are equivalent:

(1) A functor X : Jβ → C extending X.

(2) A commutative diagram

in the category C.

The equivalence carries a functor X to the evident diagram with C = X(J).

Proof. Using Proposition A.2.9.14, we see that giving an extension X : Jβ → C of X is equivalent to giving
an extension Y : (J<β)/J ⋆ {J} ⋆ (J<β)J/ → C of the composite functor

This, in turn, is equivalent to giving a commutative diagram

Remark A.2.9.16. The proof of Corollary A.2.9.15 carries over without essential change to the case where
C is an ∞-category which admits small limits and colimits. In this case, to extend a functor X : N(J<β) → C
to a functor X deﬁned on the whole of Jβ, it will suﬃce to specify the object

X(J) ∈ CX|(J<β )/J / X|(J<β )J/ ≃ CLJ (X)/ /MJ (X),

where the latching and matching objects LJ(X), MJ (X) ∈ C are deﬁned in the obvious way.

The proof of Proposition A.2.9.14 will require a few preliminaries.

Lemma A.2.9.17. Let J be a Reedy category equipped with a good ﬁltration {Jβ}β<α. Fix β < α, and let
Jβ be obtained from J<β by adjoining the object J. Let f : J → J be a map which is not the identity, let I
denote the category (JJ/)/f ≃ (J/J )f / of factorizations of the morphism f , and let I0 = I ×J J<β. Then the
nerve N I0 is weakly contractible.

Proof. Let I1 denote the full subcategory of I0 spanned by those diagrams

?(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)

I

where I ∈ J<β and f ′′ is a morphism in JR. The inclusion I1 ⊆ I0 admits a left adjoint, so that N I1 is a
deformation retract of N I0. It will therefore suﬃce to show that N I1 is weakly contractible. Let I2 denote
the full subcategory of I1 spanned by those diagrams as above where, in addition, the morphism f ′ belongs
to JL. Then the inclusion I2 ⊆ I1 admits a right adjoint, so that N I2 is a deformation retract of N I1. It
will therefore suﬃce to show that N I2 is weakly contractible. This is clear, since the category I2 consists of
a single object (with no nontrivial endomorphisms).

Lemma A.2.9.18. Let n ≥ 1, and suppose given a sequence of weakly contractible simplicial sets {Ai}1≤i≤n.
Let L denote the iterated join

{J0} ⋆ A1 ⋆ {J1} ⋆ A2 ⋆ . . . ⋆ An ⋆ {Jn},

and let K denote the simplicial subset of L spanned by those simplices which do not contain all of the vertices
{Ji}0≤i≤n. Then the inclusion K ⊆ L is a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets.

Proof. If n = 1, then this follows immediately from Lemma 5.4.5.10. Suppose that n > 1. Let X denote the
iterated join A1 ⋆ {J1} ⋆ A2 ⋆ . . . ⋆ {Jn−1} ⋆ An. For every subset S ⊆ {1, . . . , n − 1}, let X(S) denote the
simplicial subset of X spanned by those simplices which do not contain any vertex Ji for i ∈ S. Let X ′ =
S6=∅ X(S) ⊆ X(∅) = X. Then X ′ is the homotopy colimit of the diagram of simplicial sets {X(S)}S6=∅.
Each X(S) is a join of weakly contractible simplicial sets, and is therefore weakly contractible. Since n > 1,
S
the partially ordered set {S ⊆ {1, . . . , n − 1} : S 6= ∅} has a largest element, and is therefore weakly
contractible. It follows that the simplicial set X ′ is weakly contractible.

The assertion that the inclusion K ⊆ L is a categorical equivalence is equivalent to the assertion that

the diagram

({J0} ⋆ X ′)

X ′(X ′ ⋆ {Jn})

X (X ⋆ {J0})

`
{J0} ⋆ X ′ ⋆ {Jn}(cid:31)

`

/ {J0} ⋆ X ⋆ {Jn}

is a homotopy pushout square (with respect to the Joyal model structure). To prove this, it suﬃces to
observe that the vertical maps are both categorical equivalences (Lemma 5.4.5.10).

f : J

where n ≥ 1 and each fi 6= idJ . For every subset S′ ⊆ S, let X(S′) denote the simplicial subset of N(Jβ)

(∗) For every nondegenerate face τ of σ of positive dimension, if every vertex of τ coincides with J, then

τ belongs to S′.

Note that X(S) coincides with N(Jβ), while X(∅) coincides with the pushout

(N(J<β)/J ⋆ {J} ⋆ N(J<β)J/)

N(J<β).

aN(J<β )/J ⋆N(J<β )J/

It will therefore suﬃce to show that the inclusion X(∅) ⊆ X(S) is a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets.

Choose a well-ordering

S = {f 0 < f 1 < f 2 < . . .}

with the following property: if f has length shorter than g (when regarded as a chain of morphisms), then
f < g. For every ordinal α, let Sα = {f β}β<α. We will prove that for every ordinal α, the inclusion
X(∅) ⊆ X(Sα) is a categorical equivalence. The proof proceeds by induction on α.
If α = 0 there is
nothing to prove, and if α is a limit ordinal then the desired result follows from the inductive hypothesis
and the fact that the class of categorical equivalences is stable under ﬁltered colimits. We may therefore
assume that α = β + 1 is a successor ordinal. The inductive hypothesis guarantees that X(∅) ⊆ X(Sβ) is a
categorical equivalence. It will therefore suﬃce to show that the inclusion j : X(Sβ) ⊆ X(Sα) is a categorical
equivalence. We may also suppose that β is smaller than the order type of S, so that f β is well-deﬁned
(otherwise, the inclusion j is an isomorphism and the result is obvious).

Let f = f β be the composable chain of morphisms

f : J

f1→ J

f2→ . . .

fn→ J.

For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let Ai denote the nerve of the category

J<β ×J(JJ/)/fi ≃ J<β ×J(J/J )fi/.

Let K denote the simplicial subset of

{J0} ⋆ A1 ⋆ {J1} ⋆ A2 ⋆ . . . ⋆ An ⋆ {Jn}

spanned by those simplices which do not contain every vertex Jn. We then have a homotopy pushout diagram

N(J<β)/J ⋆ K ⋆ N(J<β)J/

/ X(Sβ)

N(J<β)/J ⋆ {J0} ⋆ A1 ⋆ . . . ⋆ An ⋆ {Jn} ⋆ N(J<β)J/

/ X(Sα).

It will therefore suﬃce to prove that the left vertical map is a categorical equivalence. In view of Corollary
4.2.1.3, it will suﬃce to show that the inclusion

K ⊆ {J0} ⋆ A1 ⋆ {J1} ⋆ A2 ⋆ . . . ⋆ An ⋆ {Jn}

is a categorical equivalence. Since each Ai is weakly contractible (Lemma A.2.9.17), this follows immediately
from Lemma A.2.9.18.

Proposition A.2.9.19. Let J be a Reedy category, and let A be a model category. Then there exists a model
structure on the category of functors Fun(J, A) with the following properties:

(C) A morphism X → Y in Fun(J, A) is a Reedy coﬁbration if and only if, for every object J ∈ J, the

induced map X(J)

LJ (X) LJ (Y ) → Y (J) is a coﬁbration in A.

(F ) A morphism X → Y in Fun(J, A) is a Reedy ﬁbration if and only if, for every object J ∈ J, the induced

`

map X(J) → Y (J) ×MJ (Y ) MJ (X) is a ﬁbration in A.

(W ) A morphism X → Y in Fun(J, A) is a weak equivalence if and only if, for every J ∈ J, the map

X(J) → Y (J) is a weak equivalence.

Moreover, a morphism f : X → Y in Fun(J, A) is a trivial coﬁbration if and only if the following condition
is satisﬁed:

(W C) For every object J ∈ J, the map X(J)

LJ (X) LJ (Y ) → Y (J) is a trivial coﬁbration in A.

Similarly, f is a ﬁbration if and only if it satisﬁes the dual condition:

`

(W F ) For every object J ∈ J, the map X(J) → Y (J) ×MJ (Y ) MJ (X) is a trivial ﬁbration in A.

The model structure of Proposition A.2.9.19 is called the Reedy model structure on Fun(J, A). Note that

Proposition A.2.9.19 does not require that the model category A is combinatorial.

Lemma A.2.9.20. Let J be a Reedy category containing an object J, let A be a model category, and let
f : F → G be a natural transformation in Fun(J, A). Let I ⊆ JR
/J be a sieve: that is, I is a full subcategory
of JR
/J such that I ′ ∈ I, then I ∈ I. Let I′ ⊆ I be
/J with the property that if I → I ′ is a morphism in JR
another sieve. Then:

(a) If the map f satisﬁes condition (C) of Proposition A.2.9.19 for every object I ∈ I, then the induced

map

is a coﬁbration in A.

(b) If the map f satisﬁes condition (W C) of Proposition A.2.9.19 for every object I ∈ I, then the map

χI′,I is a trivial coﬁbration in A.

Proof. We will prove (a); the proof of (b) is identical. Choose a transﬁnite sequence of sieves {Iβ ⊆ I}β<α
with the following properties:

(i) The union

β<α Iβ coincides with I.

(ii) For each β < α, the sieve Iβ is obtained from I<β = I′ ∪(

We wish to prove that χ0,α,α is a coﬁbration. We will prove more generally that χδ,γ,β is an equivalence for
every δ ≤ γ ≤ β ≤ α. The proof uses induction on γ. If γ is a limit ordinal, then we can write χδ,γ,β as
the transﬁnite composition of the maps {χǫ,ǫ+1,β}δ≤ǫ<γ, which are coﬁbrations by the inductive hypothesis.

663

We may therefore assume that γ = γ0 + 1 is a successor ordinal. If δ = γ, then χδ,γ,β is an isomorphism;
otherwise, we have δ ≤ γ0. In this case, we have

χδ,γ,β = χγ0,γ,β ◦ χδ,γ0,β.

Using the inductive hypothesis, we can reduce to the case δ = γ0. The map χγ0,γ,β is a pushout of the map
χγ0,γ,γ. We are therefore reduced to proving that χγ0,γ,γ is a coﬁbration. But χγ0,γ,γ is a pushout of the
LI (F ) F (I) → G(I) for I = Jγ0 . This map is a coﬁbration by virtue of our assumption that f
map LI(G)
satisﬁes (C).

`

Proof of Proposition A.2.9.19. Let f : X → Z be a morphism in Fun(J, A). We will prove that f admits a
factorization

f ′
→ Y

f ′′
→ Z

X

where:

(i) The map f ′′ is a ﬁbration, and f ′ satisﬁes (W C).

(ii) The map f ′ is a coﬁbration, and f ′′ satisﬁes (W F ).

By symmetry, it will suﬃce to consider case (i). Choose a good ﬁltration {Jβ}β<α of J. For β < α, let
Xβ = X| Jβ, Zβ = Z| Jβ, and let fβ : Xβ → Zβ be the restriction of f . We will construct a compatible
family of factorizations of fβ as a composition

f ′
β→ Yβ

f ′′
β→ Zβ.

Suppose that Jβ is obtained from J<β by adjoining a single new object J. Assuming that (f ′
constructed for all γ < β, we note that constructing (f ′

In other words, we must factor a certain map

Using the fact that A is a model category, we can choose a factorization where g′ is a trivial coﬁbration and
g′′ a ﬁbration. It is readily veriﬁed that this construction has the desired properties.

We now prove the following:

(i′) A morphism f : X → Y in Fun(J, A) satisﬁes (W C) if and only if f is both a ﬁbration and a weak

equivalence.

(ii′) A morphism f : X → Y in Fun(J, A) satisﬁes (W F ) if and only if f is both a coﬁbration and a weak

equivalence.

By symmetry, it will suﬃce to prove (i′). The “only if” direction follows from Lemma A.2.9.20. For the
“if” direction, it will suﬃce to show that for each β < α, the induced transformation fβ : Xβ → Yβ satisﬁes
(W C) when regarded as a morphism of Fun(Jβ, A). Suppose that Jβ is obtained from J<β by adjoining a
single new element J. We have a commutative diagram

/ Y (J).

We wish to prove that q is a trivial coﬁbration in A. Since f is a coﬁbration in Fun(J, A), the map q
is a coﬁbration in A.
It will therefore suﬃce to show that q is a weak equivalence. By the two-out-of-
three property, it will suﬃce to show that p and r are weak equivalences. For r, this follows from our
assumption that f is a weak equivalence in Fun(J, A). The map p is a pushout of the map of latching
objects LJ (X) → LJ (Y ), which is a coﬁbration in A by virtue of the inductive hypothesis and Lemma
A.2.9.20.

Combining (i) and (i′) (and the analogous assertions (ii) and (ii′)), we deduce that Fun(J, A) satisﬁes
the factorization axioms for a model category. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to verify the lifting
axioms:

(i′′) Every ﬁbration in Fun(J, A) has the right lifting property with respect to morphisms in Fun(J, A)

which satisfy (W C).

(ii′′) Every coﬁbration in Fun(J, A) has the left lifting property with respect to morphisms in Fun(J, A)

which satisfy (W F ).

Again, by symmetry it will suﬃce to prove (i′′). Consider a diagram

where f satisﬁes (W C) and g satisﬁes (F ); we wish to prove that there exists a dotted arrow h as indi-

maps {hγ}γ<β have already been constructed, and can be amalgamated to a single natural transformation
h<β : B| J<β → X| J<β. Using Corollary A.2.9.15, we see that extending h<β to a map hβ with the desired
properties is equivalent to solving a lifting problem of the kind depicted in the following diagram:

Since our assumptions guarantee that f ′ is a trivial coﬁbration and that g′ is a ﬁbration, this lifting problem
has a solution as desired.

Example A.2.9.21. Let A be the category of bisimplicial sets, which we will identify with Fun(∆op, Set∆)
and endow with the Reedy model structure. It follows from Example A.2.9.8 that a morphism f : X → Y of
bisimplicial sets is a Reedy coﬁbration if and only if it is a monomorphism. Consequently, the Reedy model
structure on A coincides with the injective model structure on A.
Example A.2.9.22. Let J be a Reedy category with JL = J, and let A be a model category. Then the
weak equivalences and coﬁbrations of the Reedy model structure (Proposition A.2.9.19) are the injective
coﬁbrations and the weak equivalences appearing in Deﬁnition A.2.8.1.
It follows that the Reedy model
structure on Fun(J, A) coincides with the injective model structure of Proposition A.2.8.2 (in particular, the
injective model structure is well deﬁned in this case even without the assumption that A is combinatorial).
Similarly, if JR = J, then we can identify the Reedy model structure on Fun(J, A) with the projective model
structure of Proposition A.2.8.2.

In the general case, we can regard the Reedy model structure on Fun(J, A) as a mixture of the projective

and injective model structures. More precisely, we have the following:

(i) A natural transformation F → G in Fun(J, A) satisﬁes condition (C) of Proposition A.2.9.19 if and

only if the induced transformation F | JR → G| JR is a projective coﬁbration in Fun(JR, A).

(ii) A natural transformation F → G in Fun(J, A) satisﬁes condition (F ) of Proposition A.2.9.19 if and

only if the induced transformation F | JL → G| JL is a injective ﬁbration in Fun(JL, A).

(iii) A natural transformation F → G in Fun(J, A) satisﬁes condition (W C) of Proposition A.2.9.19 if and
only if the induced transformation F | JR → G| JR is a trivial projective coﬁbration in Fun(JR, A).

(iv) A natural transformation F → G in Fun(J, A) satisﬁes condition (W F ) of Proposition A.2.9.19 if and

only if the induced transformation F | JL → G| JL is a trivial injective ﬁbration in Fun(JL, A).

Remark A.2.9.23. Let J be a Reedy category and A a combinatorial model category, so that the injective
and projective model structures on Fun(J, A) are well-deﬁned. The identity functor from Fun(J, A) to
itself can be regarded as a left Quillen equivalence from the projective model structure to the Reedy model
structure, and from the Reedy model structure to the injective model structure.

Corollary A.2.9.24. Let C be a small category. Suppose that there exists a well-ordering ≤ on the collection
of objects of C satisfying the following condition: for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, we have

HomC(X, Y ) =

∅
{idX }

(

if X ¿ Y
if X = Y.

Let A be a model category. Then:

(i) A natural transformation F → G in Fun(C, A) is a (trivial) projective coﬁbration if and only if, for

every object C ∈ C, the induced map

F (C)

alim−→D→C,D6=C

F (D)

F (C) → G(C) ×lim←−D→C,D6=C

Proof. Combine Example A.2.9.22 with Proposition A.2.9.19.

Corollary A.2.9.25. Let A be a model category, let α be an ordinal, and let (α) denote the linearly ordered
set {β < α}, regarded as a category. Then:

(1) Let F → F ′ be a natural transformation of diagrams (α) → A. Suppose that, for each β < α, the maps

lim
−→γ<β

F (γ) → F (β)

lim
−→γ<β

F ′(γ) → F ′(β)

are coﬁbrations, while the map F (β) → F ′(β) is a weak equivalence. Then the induced map

is a weak equivalence.

F (γ) → lim

F ′(γ)

(2) Let G → G′ be a natural transformation of diagrams (α)op → A. Suppose that, for each β < α, the

maps

G(β) → lim

G(γ)

G′(β) → lim
γ<β

G′(γ)

are ﬁbrations, while the map G(β) → G′(β) is a weak equivalence. Then the induced map

is a weak equivalence.

lim
γ<α

G(γ) → lim
γ<α

G′(γ)

Proof. We will prove (1); (2) follows by the same argument. Let p : (α) → ∗ be the unique map, let
p∗ : A → A(α) be the diagonal map, and let p! : A(α) → A be a left adjoint to p∗. Then p! can be identiﬁed
F (γ). We observe that (p!, p∗) is a Quillen adjunction (where A(α) is endowed
with the functor F 7→ lim
with the projective model structure) so that p! preserves weak equivalence between projectively coﬁbrant
objects. The desired result now follows from Corollary A.2.9.24.

Suppose that we are given a bifunctor

⊗ : A × B → C,

where C is a category which admits small limits. For any smallcategory J, we deﬁne the coend functor

We then have the following result:

Proposition A.2.9.26. Let ⊗ : A × B → C be a left Quillen bifunctor (see Proposition A.3.1.1), and let J

aCγ

ordinal, then ηδ,γ,β can be obtained as a transﬁnite composition of the maps {ηǫ,ǫ+1,β}δ≤ǫ<γ, and the result
follows from the inductive hypothesis. We may therefore assume that γ = γ0 + 1 is a successor ordinal. Since
ηδ,γ,β = ηγ0,γ,β ◦ ηδ,γ0,β, we can use the inductive hypothesis to reduce to the case where δ = γ0. Since ηδ,γ,β
is a pushout of ηδ,γ,γ, we can assume also that β = γ. In other words, we are reduced to proving that the
map

h : Cγ0+1

C′

γ0 → C′
γ0

aCγ0
is a coﬁbration, which is trivial if either f or g is trivial. Let J be the object of Jγ0 which does not belong

to F ′(J) ⊗ G′(J), which is a coﬁbration (trivial if either f or g is trivial) by virtue of our assumptions on f ,
g, and the fact that ⊗ is a left Quillen bifunctor.

Remark A.2.9.27. Proposition A.2.9.26 has an analogue for the model structures introduced in Proposition
A.2.8.2. That is, suppose that A and B are combinatorial model categories, and let J be an arbitrary small
category. Then any left Quillen bifunctor ⊗ : A × B → C induces a left Quillen bifunctor

: Fun(J, A) × Fun(Jop, B) → C,

ZJ

where we regard Fun(J, A) as endowed with the projective model structure and Fun(Jop, B) with the injective
model structure. To see this, we must show that for any projective coﬁbration f : F → F ′ in Fun(J, A) and
any injective coﬁbration g : G → G′ in Fun(Jop, B), the induced map

h :

(F, G′)

(F ′, G) →

(F ′, G′)

ZJ

aRJ(F,G) ZJ

ZJ

is a coﬁbration in C, which is trivial if either f or g is trivial. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that
f is a generating projective coﬁbration of the form FJ
A′ associated to an object J ∈ J and a coﬁbration

A → FJ

668

i : A → A′ in A, which is trivial if f is trivial (see the proof of Proposition A.2.8.2 for an explanation of this
notation). Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we can identify h with the map

(A ⊗ G′(J))

(A′ ⊗ G(J)) → A′ ⊗ G′(J).

aA⊗G(J)

Since i is a coﬁbration in A and the map G(J) → G′(J) is a coﬁbration in B, we deduce that h is a coﬁbration
in C (since ⊗ is a left Quillen bifunctor) which is trivial if either i or h is trivial.

Example A.2.9.28. Let A be a simplicial model category, so that we have a left Quillen bifunctor

The coend construction determines a left Quillen bifunctor

⊗ : A × Set∆ → A.

: Fun(∆, A) × Fun(∆op, Set∆) → A.

Z

where Fun(∆, A) and Fun(∆op, Set∆) are both endowed with the Reedy model structure. In particular, if
we ﬁx a cosimplicial object X • ∈ Fun(∆, A) which is Reedy coﬁbrant, then forming the coend against X •
determines a left Quillen functor from the category of bisimplicial sets (with the Reedy model structure,
which coincides with the injective model structure by Example A.2.9.21) to A.

Example A.2.9.29. Let A be a simplicial model category, so that we have a left Quillen bifunctor

and consider the coend functor

⊗ : A × Set∆ → A,

Fun(∆op, A) × Fun(∆, Set∆) → A.

ﬁnal object of Fun(∆, Set∆) (that is, the constant functor given by [n] 7→ ∆0). The unique map ∆• → 1 is
a weak equivalence, and ∆• is Reedy coﬁbrant: we may therefore regard ∆• as a coﬁbrant replacement for
the constant functor 1.
The functor X• 7→

∆op(X•, 1) can be identiﬁed with the colimit functor Fun(∆op, A) → A. This is a
left Quillen functor if Fun(∆op, A) is endowed with the projective model structure, but not the Reedy model
∆op(X•, ∆•) is a left Quillen functor
structure. However, the geometric realization functor X• 7→ |X•| =
with respect to the Reedy model structure.

Corollary A.2.9.30. Let A be a combinatorial simplicial model category, and let X• be a simplicial object

Proof. Let ∆• and ∗ be the cosimplicial objects of Set∆ described in Example A.2.9.29. Choose a weak

can identify the diagonal simplicial set [n] 7→ Xn,n with the homotopy colimit of corresponding diagram
∆op → Set∆.

A.3 Simplicial Categories

Among the many diﬀerent models for higher category theory, the theory of simplicial categories is perhaps
the most rigid. This can be either a curse or a blessing, depending on the situation. For the most part, we
have chosen to use the less rigid theory of ∞-categories (see §1.1.2) throughout this book. However, some
arguments are substantially easier to carry out in the setting of simplicial categories. For this reason, we
have devoted the ﬁnal section of this appendix to giving a review of the theory of simplicial categories.

There exists a model structure on the category Cat∆ of (small) simplicial categories, which was con-
structed by Bergner ([7]). In §A.3.2, we will describe an analogous model structure on the category CatS of
S-enriched categories, where S is a suitable model category. To formulate this generalization, we will need to
employ the language of monoidal model categories, which we review in §A.3.1. Under mild assumptions on S,
one can show that a S-enriched category C is ﬁbrant if and only if each of the mapping objects MapC(X, Y )
is a ﬁbrant object of S.

In §A.3.3, we will study the category AC of diagrams C → A, where C is a small category and A a model
category, both enriched over some ﬁxed model category S. In the enriched setting we can again endow AC
with projective and injective model structures, which can be used to deﬁne homotopy limits and colimits.

Putting aside set-theoretic technicalities, every S-enriched model category A gives rise to a ﬁbrant object
of CatS: namely, the full subcategory A◦ ⊆ A spanned by the ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects. In §A.3.4, we will
introduce a path object for A◦, which will enable us to perform some calculations in the homotopy category
of CatS.

In §A.3.5, we will consider the problem of constructing homotopy colimits in the category CatS of S-
enriched categories. Our main result, Theorem A.3.5.15, asserts that the formation of homotopy colimits in
CatS is compatible with the formation of (tensor) products in CatS. We will apply this result in §A.3.6 to
study the homotopy theory of internal mapping objects in CatS.

We conclude this section with §A.3.7, where we discuss localizations of (simplicial) model categories.

A.3.1 Enriched and Monoidal Model Categories

Many of the model categories which arise naturally are enriched over the category of simplicial sets. Our
goal in this section to study enrichments of one model category over another.

Deﬁnition A.3.1.1. Let A, B, and C be model categories. We will say that a functor F : A × B → C is
a left Quillen bifunctor if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(a) Let i : A → A′ and j : B → B′ be coﬁbrations in A and B, respectively. Then the induced map

i ∧ j : F (A′, B)

F (A, B′) → F (A′, B′)

aF (A,B)

is a coﬁbration in C. Moreover, if either i or j is a trivial coﬁbration, then i ∧ j is also a trivial
coﬁbration.

(b) The functor F preserves small colimits separately in each variable.

Deﬁnition A.3.1.2. A monoidal model category is a monoidal category S equipped with a model structure,
which satisﬁes the following conditions:

(i) The tensor product functor ⊗ : S × S → S is a left Quillen bifunctor.

670

(ii) The unit object 1 ∈ S is coﬁbrant.

(iii) The monoidal structure on S is closed.

Remark A.3.1.3. Some authors demand only a weakened form of axiom (ii) in the preceding deﬁnition.

Example A.3.1.4. The category of simplicial sets Set∆ is a monoidal model category, with respect to the
Cartesian product and the Kan model structure deﬁned in §A.2.7.

Deﬁnition A.3.1.5. Let S be a monoidal model category. A S-enriched model category is a S-enriched
category A equipped with a model structure satisfying the following conditions:

(1) The category A is tensored and cotensored over S.

(2) The tensor product ⊗ : A × S → A is a left Quillen bifunctor.

In the special case where S is the category of simplicial sets (regarded as a monoidal model category as in
Example A.3.1.4), we will simply refer to A as a simplicial model category.

Remark A.3.1.6. An easy formal argument shows that condition (2) is equivalent to either of the following
statements:

(2′) Given any coﬁbration i : D → D′ in A and any ﬁbration j : X → Y in A, the induced map

k : MapA(D′, X) → MapA(D, X) ×MapA(D,Y ) MapA(D′, Y )

is ﬁbration in S, which is trivial if either i or j is a weak equivalence.

(2′′) Given any coﬁbration i : C → C′ in S and any ﬁbration j : X → Y in A, the induced map

k : X C ′

→ X C ×Y C Y C ′

is a ﬁbration in A, which is trivial if either i or j is trivial.

The following provides a criterion for detecting simplicial model structures:

Proposition A.3.1.7. Let C be a simplicial category that is equipped with a model structure (not assumed
to be compatible with the simplicial structure on C). Suppose that every object of C is coﬁbrant and that the
collection of weak equivalences in C is stable under ﬁltered colimits. Then C is a simplicial model category if
and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) As a simplicial category, C is both tensored and cotensored over Set∆.

(2) Given a coﬁbration i : A → B and a ﬁbration p : X → Y in C, the induced map of simplicial sets

q : MapC(B, X) → MapC(A, X) ×MapC(A,Y ) MapC(B, Y )

is a Kan ﬁbration.

(3) For every n ≥ 0 and every object C in C, the natural map

C ⊗ ∆n → C ⊗ ∆0 ≃ C

is a weak equivalence in C.

671

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that C is a simplicial model category. It is clear that (1) and (2) are satisﬁed. To prove
(3), we note that the projection ∆n → ∆0 admits a section s : ∆0 → ∆n which is a trivial coﬁbration. If C is
a simplicial model category, then since C is coﬁbrant it follows that C ⊗ ∆0 → C ⊗ ∆n is a trivial coﬁbration,
and in particular a weak equivalence. Thus the projection C ⊗ ∆n → C ⊗ ∆0 is a weak equivalence by the
two-out-of-three property.

Now suppose that (1), (2), and (3) are satisﬁed. We wish to show that C is a simplicial model category.

We ﬁrst show that the bifunctor

(C, K) 7→ C ⊗ K

preserves weak equivalences separately in each variable separately.

Fix the object C ∈ C, and suppose that f : K → K ′ is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial
sets. Choose a coﬁbration K → K ′′, where K ′′ is a contractible Kan complex. Then we may factor f as a
composition

→ K × K ′′ f ′′
f ′
To prove that idC ⊗f is a weak equivalence, it suﬃces to prove that idC ⊗f ′ and idC ⊗f ′′ are weak equiva-
lences. Note that the map f ′′ has a section s, which is a trivial coﬁbration. Thus, to prove that idC ⊗f ′′ is
a weak equivalence, it suﬃces to show that idC ⊗s is a weak equivalence. In other words, we may reduce to
the case where f is itself a trivial coﬁbration of simplicial sets.

→ K.

K

Consider the collection A of all monomorphisms f : K → K ′ of simplicial sets having the property that
idC ⊗f is a weak equivalence in C. It is easy to see that this collection of morphisms is weakly saturated.
Thus, to prove that it contains all trivial coﬁbrations of simplicial sets, it suﬃces to show that every horn
i → ∆n belongs to A. We prove this by induction on n > 0. Choose a vertex v belonging to Λn
inclusion Λn
i .
We note that the inclusion {v} → Λn
is a pushout of horn inclusions in dimensions < n; by the inductive
i
hypothesis, this inclusion belongs to A. Thus, it suﬃces to show that {v} → ∆n belongs to A, which is
equivalent to assumption (3).

Now let us show that for each simplicial set K, the functor

C 7→ C ⊗ K

preserves weak equivalences. We will prove this by induction on the (possibly inﬁnite) dimension of K.
Choose a weak equivalence g : C → C′ in C. Let S denote the collection of all simplicial subsets L ⊆ K
such that g ⊗ idL is a weak equivalence. We regard S as a partially ordered set with respect to inclusions
of simplicial subsets. Clearly ∅ ∈ S. Since weak equivalences in C are stable under ﬁltered colimits, the
supremum of every chain in S belongs to S. By Zorn’s lemma, S has a maximal element L. We wish to
show that L = K. If not, we may choose some nondegenerate simplex σ of K which does not belong to L.
Choose σ of the smallest possible dimension, so that all of the faces of σ belong to L. Thus, there is an
inclusion L′ = L

∂ σ σ ⊆ K. Since C is left proper, assumption (2) implies that the diagram

`

D ⊗ ∂ σ

D ⊗ σ

D ⊗ L

/ D ⊗ L′

is a homotopy pushout, for every object D ∈ C. We observe that g ⊗idL is a weak equivalence by assumption,
g⊗id∂ σ is a weak equivalence by the inductive hypothesis (since ∂ σ has dimension smaller than the dimension
of K), and g ⊗ idσ is a weak equivalence in virtue of assumption (3) and the fact that g is a weak equivalence.
It follows that g ⊗ idL′ is a weak equivalence, which contradicts the maximality of L. This completes the
proof that the bifunctor ⊗ : C × Set∆ → C preserves weak equivalences separately in each variable.

Now suppose given a coﬁbration i : C → C′ in C and another coﬁbration j : S → S′ in Set∆. We wish to

prove that the induced map

i ∧ j : (C ⊗ S′)

(C′ ⊗ S) → C′ ⊗ S′

aC⊗S

672

/
/
(cid:15)
(cid:15)
(cid:15)
(cid:15)

is a coﬁbration in C, which is trivial if either i or j is trivial. The ﬁrst point follows immediately from (2).
For the triviality, we will assume that i is a weak equivalence (the case where j is a weak equivalence follows
using the same argument). Consider the diagram

C ⊗ S

i⊗idS

C′ ⊗ S

C ⊗ S′

f

/ (C′ ⊗ S)

C⊗S(C ⊗ S′)

/ C′ ⊗ S′.

`
The arguments above show that i ⊗ idS and i ⊗ idS′ are weak equivalences. The square in the diagram is a
homotopy pushout, so Proposition A.2.4.2 implies that f is a weak equivalence as well. Thus i ∧ j is a weak
equivalence, by the two-out-of-three property.

If C is a simplicial model category, then there is automatically a strong relationship between the homotopy
theory of the underlying model category and the homotopy theory of the simplicial sets MapC(•, •). For
example, we have the following:

Remark A.3.1.8. Let C be a simplicial model category, let X be a coﬁbrant object of C, and let Y be a
ﬁbrant object of C. The simplicial set K = MapC(X, Y ) is a Kan complex; moreover, there is a canonical
bijection

π0K ≃ HomhC(X, Y ).

We conclude this section by studying a situation which will arise in §3. Let C and D be model categories

enriched over another model category S, and suppose given a Quillen adjunction

C

F /
G

/ D

between the underlying model categories. We wish to study the situation where G (but not F ) has the
structure of a S-enriched functor. Thus, for every triple of objects X ∈ C, Y ∈ D, S ∈ S, we have a
canonical map

HomC(S ⊗ X, GY ) ≃ HomS(S, MapC(X, GY ))

→ HomS(S, MapD(F X, F GY ))
≃ HomD(S ⊗ F X, F GY )

→ HomD(S ⊗ F X, Y ).

Taking Y = F (S ⊗ X) and applying this map to the unit of the adjunction between F and G, we obtain a
map S ⊗ F X → F (S ⊗ X), which we will denote by βX,S. The collection of maps βX,S is simply another
way of encoding the data of G as a S-enriched functor.
If the maps βX,S are isomorphisms, then F is
again a S-enriched functor, and (F, G) is an adjunction between S-enriched categories. We wish to study an
analogous situation, where the maps βX,S are only assumed to be weak equivalences.

Remark A.3.1.9. Suppose that S is the category Set∆ of simplicial sets, with its usual model structure.
Then the map βX,S is automatically a weak equivalence for every coﬁbrant object X ∈ C. To prove this, we
consider the collection K of all simplicial sets S such that βS,X is an equivalence. It is not diﬃcult to show
that K is closed under weak equivalences, homotopy pushout squares, and coproducts. Since ∆0 ∈ K, we
conclude that K = Set∆.

Proposition A.3.1.10. Let C and D be S-enriched model categories. Let C

F /
G

/ D

be a Quillen adjunction

between the underlying model categories. Assume that every object of C is coﬁbrant, and that the map
βX,S : S ⊗ F (X) → F (S ⊗ X) is a weak equivalence for every pair of coﬁbrant objects X ∈ C, S ∈ S. The
following are equivalent:

(1) The adjunction (F, G) is a Quillen equivalence.

(2) The restriction of G determines a weak equivalence of S-enriched categories D◦ → C◦ (see §A.3.2).

Remark A.3.1.11. Strictly speaking, in §A.3.2 we only deﬁne weak equivalences between small S-enriched
categories; however, the deﬁnition extends to large categories in an obvious way.

Proof. Since G preserves ﬁbrant objects, and every object of C is coﬁbrant, it is clear that G carries D◦
into C◦. Condition (1) is equivalent to the assertion that for every pair of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects C ∈ C,
D ∈ D, a map g : C → GD is a weak equivalence in C if and only if the adjoint map f : F C → D is a
→ D, where f ′ is a trivial
weak equivalence in D. Choose a factorization of f ′ as a composition F C
coﬁbration and f ′′ is a ﬁbration. By the two-out-of-three property, f is a weak equivalence if and only if f ′′
is a weak equivalence. We note that g admits an analogous factorization as

→ D′ f ′′
f ′

→ GD′ g′′
g′

→ GD.

C

Using (2), we deduce that f ′′ is an equivalence in D◦ if and only if g′′ is an equivalence in C◦. It will therefore
suﬃce to show that g′ is an equivalence in C◦. For this, it will suﬃce to show that C and GD′ corepresent
the same functor on the homotopy category hC. Invoking (2) again, it will suﬃce to show that for every
ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object D′′ ∈ D, the induced map

HomhC(GD′, GD′′) → HomhC(C, GD′′) ≃ HomhD(F C, D′′)

is bijective. Using (2), we deduce that map HomhD(D′, D′′) → HomhD(GD′, GD′′) is bijective. The desired
result now follows from the fact that f ′ is a weak equivalence in D.

We now show that (1) ⇒ (2). The S-enriched functor G◦ : D◦ → C◦ is essentially surjective, since the
right derived functor RG is essentially surjective on homotopy categories. It suﬃces to show that G◦ is fully
faithful: in other words, that for every pair of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects X, Y ∈ D, the induced map

i : MapD(X, Y ) → MapC(G(X), G(Y ))

is a weak equivalence in S.

Since the left derived functor LF is essentially surjective, there exists an object X ′ ∈ C and a weak
equivalence F X ′ → X. We may regard X as a ﬁbrant replacement for F X ′ in D; it follows that the adjoint
map X ′ → GX may be identiﬁed with the adjunction X ′ → (RG◦LF )X ′, and is therefore a weak equivalence
by (1). Thus we have a diagram

MapD(X, Y )

MapD(F (X ′), Y )

i

i′

/ MapC(G(X), G(Y ))

/ MapC(X ′, G(Y ))

in which the vertical arrows are homotopy equivalences; thus, to show that i is a weak equivalence, it
suﬃces to show that i′ is a weak equivalence. For this, it suﬃces to show that i′ induces a bijection from
[S, MapD(F (X ′), Y )] to [S, MapC(X ′, G(Y ))], for every coﬁbrant object S ∈ S; here [S, K] denotes the set
of homotopy classes of maps from S into K in the homotopy category hS. But we may rewrite this map of
sets as

S : MaphD(F (X ′) ⊗ S, Y ) → MaphC(X ′ ⊗ S, G(Y )) = MaphD(F (X ′ ⊗ S), Y ),
i′
and it is given by composition with βX ′,S. (Here hC and hD denote the homotopy categories of C and D as
model categories; these are equivalent to the corresponding homotopy categories of C◦ and D◦ as S-enriched
categories). Since βX ′,S is an isomorphism in the homotopy category hD, the map i′
S is bijective and (2)
holds, as desired.

A.3.2 The Model Structure on S-Enriched Categories

Throughout this section, we will ﬁx a symmetric monoidal model category S, and study the category of S-
enriched categories. The main case of interest to us is that in which S is the category of simplicial sets (with
its usual model structure and the Cartesian monoidal structure). However, the treatment of the general
case requires little additional eﬀort, and there are a number of other examples which arise naturally in other
contexts:

(i) The category Set∆ of simplicial sets, equipped with the Cartesian monoidal structure and the Joyal

model structure deﬁned in §2.2.5.

(ii) The category of complexes

. . . → Mn → Mn → Mn−1 → . . . ,

of vector spaces over a ﬁeld k, with its usual model structure (in which weak equivalences are quasi-
isomorphisms, ﬁbrations are epimorphisms, and coﬁbrations are monomorphisms) and monoidal struc-
ture given by the formation of tensor products of complexes.

Let S be an monoidal model category, and let CatS denote the category of (small) S-enriched categories,
in which morphisms are given by S-enriched functors. The goal of this section is to describe a model
structure on CatS. We ﬁrst note that the monoidal structure on S induces a monoidal structure on its
homotopy category hS, which is determined up to (unique) isomorphism by the requirement that there exist
a monoidal structure on the functor

S → hS

given by inverting all weak equivalences. Consequently, we note that any S-enriched category C gives rise to
an hS-enriched category hC, having the same objects as C and where mapping spaces are given by

MaphC(X, Y ) = [MapC(X, Y )].

Here we let [K] denote the image in hS of an object K ∈ S. We will refer to hC as the homotopy category
of C; the passage from C to hC is a special case of Remark A.1.4.3.

Deﬁnition A.3.2.1. Let S be an monoidal model category. We say that a functor F : C → C′ in CatS is
a weak equivalence if the induced functor hC → hC′ is an equivalence of hS-enriched categories. In other
words, F is a weak equivalence if and only if:

(1) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the induced map

MapC(X, Y ) → MapC′ (F (X), F (Y ))

is a weak equivalence in S.

(2) Every object Y ∈ C′ is equivalent to F (X) in the homotopy category hC′, for some X ∈ C.

Remark A.3.2.2. If S is the category Set∆ (endowed with the Kan model structure), then Deﬁnition
A.3.2.1 reduces to the deﬁnition given in §1.1.3.

Remark A.3.2.3. Suppose that the collection of weak equivalences in S is stable under ﬁltered colimits.
Then it is easy to see that the collection of weak equivalences in CatS is also stable under ﬁltered colimits.
If S is also a combinatorial model category, then a bit more eﬀort shows that the class of weak equivalences
in CatS is perfect, in the sense of Deﬁnition A.2.6.10.

675

We now introduce a bit of notation for working with S-enriched categories. If A is an object of S, we

will let [1]A denote the S-enriched category having two objects X and Y , with

if Z = Z ′ = X
1S
if Z = Z ′ = Y
1S
A if Z = X, Z ′ = Y
if Z = Y, Z ′ = X.
∅

Map[1]A(Z, Z ′) = 



Here ∅ denotes the initial object of S and 1S denotes the unit object with respect to the monoidal structure
on S. We will denote [1]1S simply by [1]S. We let [0]S denote the S-enriched category having only a single
object X, with Map∗(X, X) = 1S.

We let C0 denote the collection of all morphisms in S of the following types:

(i) The inclusion ∅ ֒→ [0]S.

(ii) The induced maps [1]S → [1]S′, where S → S′ ranges over a set of generators for the weakly saturated

class of coﬁbrations in S.

Proposition A.3.2.4. Let S be a combinatorial monoidal model category. Assume that every object of S is
coﬁbrant, and that the collection of weak equivalences in S is stable under ﬁltered colimits. Then there exists
a left proper, combinatorial model structure on CatS, characterized by the following conditions:

(C) The class of coﬁbrations in CatS is the smallest weakly saturated class of morphisms containing the set

of morphisms C0 appearing above.

(W ) The weak equivalences in CatS are deﬁned as in §A.3.2.1.

Proof. It suﬃces to verify the hypotheses of Proposition A.2.6.13. Condition (1) follows from Remark A.3.2.3.
For condition (3), we must show that any functor F : C → C′ having the right lifting property with respect to
all morphisms in C0 is a weak equivalence. Since F has the right lifting property with respect to i : ∅ → [0]S,
it is surjective on objects and therefore essentially surjective. The assumption that F has the right lifting
property with respect to the remaining morphisms of C0 guarantees that for every X, Y ∈ C, the induced
map

MapC(X, Y ) → MapC′ (F (X), F (Y ))

is a trivial ﬁbration in S, and therefore a weak equivalence.

It remains to verify condition (2): namely, that the class of weak equivalences is stable under pushout
by the elements of C0. We must show that given any pair of functors F : C → D, G : C → C′ with F a weak
C C′ is a weak
equivalence and G a pushout of some morphism in C0, the induced map F ′ : C′ → D′ = D
equivalence. There are two cases to consider.

First, suppose that G is a pushout of the generating coﬁbration i : ∅ → ∗. In other words, the category
C′ is obtained from C by adjoining a new object X, which admits no morphisms to or from the objects of
C (and no endomorphisms other than the identity). The category D′ is obtained from D by adjoining X in
the same fashion. It is easy to see that if F is a weak equivalence, then F ′ is also a weak equivalence.

The other basic case to consider is one in which G is a pushout of one of the generating coﬁbrations
[1]S → [1]T , where S → T is a coﬁbration in S. Let H : [1]S → C denote the “attaching map”, so that H is
determined by a pair of objects x = H(X) and y = H(Y ) and a map of h : S → MapC(x, y). By deﬁnition,
C′ is universal with respect to the property that it receives a map from C, and the map h extends to a map
h : T → MapC′ (x, y). To carry out the proof, we will give an explicit construction of a S-enriched category
C′ which has this universal property.
e
for notational convenience; the same arguments can be employed without change in the general case.

For the remainder of the proof, we will assume that S is the category of simplicial sets. This is purely

676

`

We begin by declaring that the objects of C′ are the objects of C. The deﬁnition of the morphisms in
C′ as

C′ is a bit more complicated. Let w and z be objects of C. We deﬁne a sequence of simplicial sets M k
follows:

M 0

C = MapC(w, z)

M 1

C = MapC(y, z) × T × MapC(w, x)

M 2

C = MapC(y, z) × T × MapC(y, x) × T × MapC(w, x)

and so forth. More speciﬁcally, for k ≥ 1, the m-simplices of M k

C are ﬁnite sequences

(σ0, τ1, σ1, τ2, . . . , τk, σk)

where σ0 ∈ MapC(y, z)m, σk ∈ MapC(w, x)m, σi ∈ MapC(y, x)m for 0 < i < k, and τi ∈ Tm for 1 ≤ i ≤ k.

We deﬁne MapC′ (w, z) to be the quotient of the disjoint union

is generated by making the identiﬁcation

k M k

C by the equivalence relation which

`

(σ0, τ1, . . . , σk) ≃ (σ0, τ1, . . . , τj−1, σj−1 ◦ h(τj ) ◦ σj , τj+1, . . . , σk)

whenever the simplex τj belongs to Sm ⊆ Tm.

We equip C′ with an associative composition law, which is given on the level of simplices by

(σ0, τ1, . . . , σk) ◦ (σ′

0, τ ′

1, . . . , σ′

l) = (σ0, τ1, . . . , τk, σk ◦ σ′

0, τ ′

1, . . . , σ′

l).

It is easy to verify that this composition law is well-deﬁned (that is, compatible with the equivalence relation
introduced above), associative, and that the identiﬁcation M 0
C = MapC(w, z) gives rise to an inclusion of
categories C ⊆ C′. Moreover, the map h : S → MapC(x, y) extends to
h : T → MapC′(x, y), given by the
composition

T ≃ {idy} × T × {idx} ⊆ MapC(y, y) × T × MapC(x, x) = M 1

C → MapC′ (x, y).

e

Moreover, it is not diﬃcult to see that C′ has the desired universal property.

We observe that, by construction, the simplicial sets MapC′(w, z) come equipped with a natural ﬁltration.

Namely, deﬁne MapC′ (w, z)k to be the image of

in MapC′(w, z). Then we have

MapC(w, z) = MapC′ (w, z)0 ⊆ MapC′ (w, z)1 ⊆ . . .

C ⊆ M k+1

k MapC′ (w, z)k = MapC′ (w, z). Moreover, the inclusion MapC′(w, z)k ⊆ MapC′(w, z)k+1 is a pushout
whose m-simplices consist of

and
of the inclusion N k+1
those (2m + 1)-tuples (σ0, τ1, . . . , σm) such that τi ∈ Sm for at least one value of i.

S
Let us now return to the problem at hand: namely, we wish to prove that F ′ : C′ → D′ is an equivalence.
We note that the construction outlined above may also be employed to produce a model for D′, and an
analogous ﬁltration on its morphism spaces.

, where N k+1 is the simplicial subset of M k+1

C

C

Since G′ : D → D′ and F : C → D are essentially surjective, we deduce that F ′ is essentially surjective.

Hence it will suﬃce to show that, for any objects w, z ∈ C′, the induced map

φ : MapC′ (w, z) → MapD′ (w, z)

is a weak homotopy equivalence. For this, it will suﬃce to show that for each i ≥ 0, the induced map
φi : MapC′ (w, z)i → MapD′ (w, z)i is a weak homotopy equivalence; then φ, being a ﬁltered colimit of weak
homotopy equivalences φi, will itself be a weak homotopy equivalence.

677

The proof now proceeds by induction on i. When i = 0, φi is a weak homotopy equivalence by assumption
(since F is an equivalence of simplicial categories). For the inductive step, we note that φi+1 is obtained as
a pushout

MapC′(w, z)i

M i+1

C → MapD′ (w, z)i

M i+1
D .

C

Since S is left-proper, both of these pushouts are homotopy pushouts. Consequently, to show that φi+1 is a
weak equivalence, it suﬃces to show that φi is a weak equivalence and the each of the maps

N i+1

C → N i+1

D

C → M i+1
are weak equivalences. These statements follow easily from the compatibility of the monoidal structure of S
with the model structure, and the assumption that every object of S is coﬁbrant.

Remark A.3.2.5. It follows from the proof of Proposition A.3.2.4 that if f : C → C′ is a coﬁbration of
S-enriched categories, then the induced map MapC(X, Y ) → MapC′(f X, f Y ) is a coﬁbration for every pair
of objects X, Y ∈ C.

Remark A.3.2.6. The model structure of Proposition A.3.2.4 enjoys the following functoriality: suppose
that f : S → S′ is a monoidal left Quillen functor between model categories satisfying the hypotheses of
Proposition A.3.2.4, with right adjoint g : S′ → S. Then f and g induce a Quillen adjunction

CatS

F /
G

/ CatS′,

where F and G are as in Remark A.1.4.3. Moreover, if (f, g) is a Quillen equivalence, then (F, G) is likewise
a Quillen equivalence.

In order for Proposition A.3.2.4 to be useful in practice, we need to understand the ﬁbrations in CatS.

For this, we ﬁrst introduce a few deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition A.3.2.7. Let F : C → D be a functor between ordinary categories. We will say that F is
a quasi-ﬁbration if, for every object C ∈ C and every isomorphism f : F (X) → Y in D, there exists an
isomorphism f : X → Y in C such that F (f ) = f .

Remark A.3.2.8. The relevance of Deﬁnition A.3.2.7 is as follows: the category Cat admits a model
structure in which the weak equivalences are the equivalences of categories, and the ﬁbrations are the quasi-
ﬁbrations. This is a special case of Theorem A.3.2.24, which we will prove below (namely, the special case
where we take S = Set, endowed with the trivial model structure of Example A.2.1.2).

Deﬁnition A.3.2.9. Let S be a monoidal model category, and let C be a S-enriched category. We will say
that a morphism f in C is an equivalence if the homotopy class [f ] of f is an isomorphism in hC.

We will say that C is locally ﬁbrant if, for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the mapping space MapC(X, Y )

is a ﬁbrant object of S.

We will say that a S-enriched functor F : C → C′ is a local ﬁbration if the following conditions are

satisﬁed:

(i) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the induced map MapC(X, Y ) → MapC′ (F X, F Y ) is a ﬁbration in

S.

(ii) The induced map hC → hC′ is a quasi-ﬁbration of categories.

Remark A.3.2.10. Let F : C → C′ be a functor between S-enriched categories which satisﬁes condition
(i) of Deﬁnition A.3.2.9. Let X ∈ C and Y ∈ C′ be objects. If C′ is locally ﬁbrant, then every morphism
[f ] : F (X) → Y in hC′ can be represented by an equivalence f : F (X) → Y in C′. Let Y be an object of C
such that F (Y = Y . Since 1S is a coﬁbrant object of S and the map MapC(X, Y ) → MapC(F (X), Y ) is a
ﬁbration, Proposition A.2.3.1 implies that [f ] can be lifted to an isomorphism [f ] : X → Y in hC if and only
if f can be lifted to an equivalence f : X → Y in C. Consequently, when hC is locally ﬁbrant, condition (ii)
is equivalent to the following analogous assertion:

(ii′) For every equivalence f : F (X) → Y in C′, there exists an equivalence f : X → Y in C such that

F (f ) = f .

Notation A.3.2.11. We [1]∼

S denote the S-enriched category containing a pair of objects X, Y , with

for all Z, Z ′ ∈ {X, Y }.

Map[1]∼

S (Z, Z ′) = 1S

Deﬁnition A.3.2.12 (Invertibility Hypothesis). Let S be a monoidal model category satisfying the hypothe-
ses of Proposition A.3.2.4. We will say that S satisﬁes the invertibility hypothesis if the following condition
is satisﬁed:

(∗) Let i : [1]S → C be a coﬁbration of S-enriched categories, classifying a morphism f in C which is

invertible in the homotopy category hC, and form a pushout diagram

[1]S

i

C

j

[1]∼
S

/ Chf −1i

Then j is an equivalence of S-enriched categories.

In other words, the invertibility hypothesis is the assertion that inverting a morphism f in a S-enriched

category C does not change the homotopy type of C when f is already invertible up to homotopy.

Remark A.3.2.13. Let S, f , and C be as in Deﬁnition A.3.2.12, and choose a trivial coﬁbration F : C → C′,
where C′ is a ﬁbrant S-enriched category. Since CatS is left proper, the induced map Chf −1i → C′hF (f )−1i
is an equivalence of S-enriched categories. Consequently, assertion (∗) holds for (C, f ) if and only if it holds
for (C′, F (f )). In other words, to test whether S satisﬁes the invertibility hypothesis, we only need to check
(∗) in the case where C is ﬁbrant.

Remark A.3.2.14. In Deﬁnition A.3.2.12, the condition that i be a coﬁbration guarantees that the con-
struction C 7→ Chf −1i is homotopy invariant. Alternatively, we can guarantee this by choosing a coﬁbrant
replacement for the map j : [1]S → [1]∼

S . Namely, choose a factorization for j as a composition

where j′′ is a weak equivalence and j′ is a coﬁbration. For every S-enriched category containing a morphism
E. Then we have a canonical map C[f −1] → Chf −1i, which is an equivalence
f , deﬁne C[f −1] = C
whenever the map [1]S → C classifying f is a coﬁbration. Moreover, the construction C 7→ C[f −1] preserves
weak equivalences in C. Consequently, we may reformulate the invertibility hypothesis as follows:

`

[1]S

(∗′) For every S-enriched category C containing an equivalence f , the map C → C[f −1] is a weak equivalence

of S-enriched categories.

Remark A.3.2.15. Let C be a ﬁbrant S-enriched category containing an equivalence f : X → Y , and
let C[f −1] be deﬁned as in Remark A.3.2.14. The canonical map C → C[f −1] is a trivial coﬁbration, and
therefore admits a section. This section determines a map of S-enriched categories h : E → C. We observe
that E is a mapping cylinder for the object [0]CatS ∈ CatS, so we can view h as a homotopy between the
maps [0]CatS → C classifying the objects X and Y .

More generally, the same argument shows that if F : C → D is a ﬁbration of S-enriched categories and
f : X → Y is an equivalence in C such that F (f ) = idD for some object D ∈ D, then the functors [0]S → C
classifying the objects X and Y are homotopic in the model category (CatS)/ D.

Deﬁnition A.3.2.16. We will say that a model category S is excellent if it is equipped with a symmetric
monoidal structure and satisﬁes the following conditions:

(A1) The model category S is combinatorial.

(A2) Every monomorphism in S is a coﬁbration, and the collection of coﬁbrations is stable under products.

(A3) The collection of weak equivalences in S is stable under ﬁltered colimits.

(A4) The monoidal structure on S is compatible with the model structure.

In other words, the tensor

product functor ⊗ : S × S → S is a left Quillen bifunctor.

(A5) The monoidal model category S satisﬁes the invertibility hypothesis.

Remark A.3.2.17. Axiom (A2) of Deﬁnition A.3.2.16 implies that every object of S is coﬁbrant.
particular, S is left proper.

In

Example A.3.2.18 (Dwyer, Kan). The category of simplicial sets is an excellent model category, when
endowed with the Kan model structure and the Cartesian product. The only nontrivial point is to show that
Set∆ satisﬁes the invertibility hypothesis. This is one of the main theorems of [21].

Example A.3.2.19. Let S be a presentable category equipped with a closed symmetric monoidal structure.
Then S is an excellent model category with respect to the trivial model structure of Example A.2.1.2.

The following lemma guarantees a good supply of examples of excellent model categories:

Lemma A.3.2.20. Suppose given a monoidal left Quillen functor T : S → S′ between model categories S
and S′ satisfying axioms (A1) through (A4) of Deﬁnition A.3.2.16. If S satisﬁes axiom (A5), then so does
S′.

Proof. As indicated in Remark A.3.2.6, the functor T determines a Quillen adjunction

Let C be a S′-enriched category and i : [1]S′ → C a coﬁbration classifying an equivalence f in C. We wish to
prove that the map C → Chf −1i is an equivalence of S′-enriched categories. In view of Remark A.3.2.13, we
may assume that C is ﬁbrant.

Choose a factorization of the map [1]S → [1]∼

as in Remark A.3.2.14, so that we have an analogous factorization

in CatS′ . Using the latter factorization, we can deﬁne C[f −1] as in Remark A.3.2.14; we wish to show that
the map h : C → C[f −1] is a trivial coﬁbration.

Let f0 be the morphism in G(C) classiﬁed by f , and let G(C)[f −1

0 ] ∈ CatS be deﬁned as in Remark
A.3.2.14. Using the fact that C is locally ﬁbrant (see Theorem A.3.2.24 below), we conclude that f0 is an
equivalence in G(C). Since S satisﬁes the invertibility hypothesis, the map h0 : G(C) → G(C)[f −1
0 ] is a trivial
coﬁbration. We now conclude by observing that h is a pushout of F (h0).

Remark A.3.2.21. Using a similar argument, we can prove a converse to Lemma A.3.2.20 in the case where
T is a Quillen equivalence.
Example A.3.2.22. Let S be the category Set+
∆ of marked simplicial sets, endowed with the Cartesian
model structure deﬁned in §3.1. Then the functor X 7→ X ♯ is a monoidal left Quillen functor Set∆ → S.
Combining Example A.3.2.18 with Lemma A.3.2.20, we conclude that S satisﬁes the invertibility hypothesis,
so that S is an excellent model category (with respect to the Cartesian product).

Example A.3.2.23. Let S denote the category of simplicial sets, endowed with the Joyal model structure.
The functor X 7→ X ♭ determines a monoidal left Quillen equivalence S → Set+
∆. Using Remark A.3.2.21, we
deduce that S satisﬁes the invertibility hypothesis, so that S is an excellent model category (with respect to
the Cartesian product).

We are now ready to state our main result:

Theorem A.3.2.24. Let S be an excellent model category. Then:

(1) An S-enriched category C is a ﬁbrant object of CatS if and only if it is locally ﬁbrant: that is, if and

only if the mapping object MapC(X, Y ) ∈ S is ﬁbrant for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C.

(2) Let F : C → D be a S-enriched functor, where D is a ﬁbrant object of CatS. Then F is a ﬁbration in

CatS if and only if F is a local ﬁbration.

Remark A.3.2.25. In the case where S is the category of simplicial sets (with its usual model structure),
Theorem A.3.2.24 is due to Bergner; see [7]. Moreover, Bergner proves a stronger result in this case: assertion
(2) holds without the assumption that D is ﬁbrant.

Before giving the proof of proof of Theorem A.3.2.24, we need to establish some preliminaries. Fix
an excellent model category S. We observe that CatS is naturally cotensored over S. That is, for every
S-enriched category C and every object K ∈ S, we can deﬁne a new S-enriched category CK as follows:

(i) The objects of CK are the objects of C.

(ii) Given a pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, we have MapCK (X, Y ) = MapC(X, Y )K ∈ S.

This construction does not endow CatS with the structure of a S-enriched category, because the construc-
tion D 7→ DK is not compatible with colimits in K. However, we can remedy the situation as follows. Let C
and D be S-enriched categories, and let φ be a function from the set of objects of C to the set of objects of D.
Then there exists an object Mapφ
CatS (C, D) ∈ S, which is characterized by the following universal property:
for every K ∈ S, there is a natural bijection

HomS(K, Mapu

CatS(C, D)) ≃ Homφ

CatS (C, DK),

where Homφ
φ.

CatS(C, DK) denotes the set of all functors from C to DK which is given on objects by the function

(a) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the diagram

MapC(X, Y )

MapD(F X, F Y )

MapC′ (uX, uY )

/ MapD′ (u′F X, u′F Y )

is homotopy pullback square between ﬁbrant objects of S, and the vertical arrows are ﬁbrations.

Let G : A → B be a functor between S-enriched categories which is a transﬁnite composition of pushouts
of generating coﬁbrations of the form [1]S → [1]S′ , where S → S′ is a coﬁbration in S, and let φ be a function
from the set of objects of B (which is isomorphic to the set of objects of A) to C. Then the diagram

is a homotopy pullback square between ﬁbrant objects of S, and the vertical arrows are ﬁbrations.

Proof. It is easy to see that the collection of morphisms G : A → B which satisfy the conclusion of the
lemma is weakly saturated. It will therefore suﬃce to show that G contains every morphism of the form
[1]S → [1]S′, where S → S′ is a coﬁbration in S. In this case, φ determines a pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, and
we can rewrite the diagram of interest as

MapC(X, Y )S′

MapC(X, Y )S ×MapD(F X,F Y )S MapD(F X, F Y )S′

MapC′ (uX, uY )S′

/ MapC′ (uX, uY )S ×MapD′ (u′F X,u′F Y )S MapD′ (u′F X, u′F Y )S′

.

The desired result now follows from (a), since the map S → S′ is a coﬁbration between coﬁbrant objects of
S.

Proof of Theorem A.3.2.24. Assertion (1) is just a special case of (2), where we take D to be the ﬁnal object
of CatS. It will therefore suﬃce to prove (2).

We ﬁrst prove the “only if” direction. If F is a ﬁbration, then F has the right lifting property with respect
to every trivial coﬁbration of the form [1]S → [1]S′, where S → S′ is a trivial coﬁbration in S. It follows
that for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the induced map MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(F X, F Y ) is a ﬁbration in
S. In particular, C is locally ﬁbrant.

To complete the proof that F is a local ﬁbration, we will show that F satisﬁes condition (ii′) of Remark
A.3.2.10. Suppose X ∈ C, and that f : F X → Y is an equivalence in D. We wish to show that we can lift
f to an equivalence f : X → Y . Let E and D[f −1] be deﬁned as in Remark A.3.2.14. Since S satisﬁes the
invertibility hypothesis, the map h : D → D[f −1] is a trivial coﬁbration. Because we have assumed D to be
ﬁbrant, the map h admits a section. This section determines a map s : E → D. We now consider the lifting

Since F is a ﬁbration and the left vertical map is a trivial coﬁbration, there exists a solution as indicated.
This solution determines a morphism f : X → Y in C lifting f . Moreover, f is the image of a morphism in
E. Since every morphism in E is an equivalence, we deduce that f is an equivalence in C.

Let us now suppose that F is a local ﬁbration. We wish to show that F is a ﬁbration. Choose a

factorization of F as a composition

C u→ C′ F ′

→ D,

where u is a weak equivalence and F ′ is a ﬁbration. We will prove the following:

(∗) Suppose given a commutative diagram of S-enriched categories

A v

where G is a coﬁbration. If there exists a functor α : B → C′ such that αG = uv and F ′α = v′, then
there exists a functor β : B → C such that βG = v and F β = v′.

Since the map F ′ has the right lifting property with respect to all trivial coﬁbrations, assertion (∗) implies
that F also has the right lifting property with respect to all trivial coﬁbrations, so that F is a ﬁbration as
desired.

We now prove (∗). Using the small object argument, we deduce that the functor G is a retract of some
functor G′ : A → B′, where G′ is a transﬁnite composition of morphisms obtained as pushouts of generating
coﬁbrations. It will therefore suﬃce to prove (∗) after replacing G by G′.

Reordering the transﬁnite composition if necessary, we may assume that G′ factors as a composition

We conclude this section with a few easy results concerning homotopy limits in the model category CatS.

Proposition A.3.2.27. Let S be an excellent model category, J a small category, and {CJ }J∈J a dia-
gram of S-enriched categories. Suppose given a compatible family of functors {fJ : C → CJ }J∈J which
exhibits C as a homotopy limit of the diagram {CJ }J∈J in CatS. Then for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C,
the maps {MapC(X, Y ) → MapCJ (fJ X, fJ Y )}J∈J exhibit MapC(X, Y ) as a homotopy limit of the diagram
{MapCJ (fJ X, fJ Y )}J∈J in S.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the diagram {CJ }J∈J is injectively ﬁbrant, and
that the maps fJ exhibit C as a limit of {CJ }J∈J. It follows that MapC(X, Y ) is a limit of the diagram
{MapCJ (fJ X, fJ Y )}J∈J. It will therefore suﬃce to show that the diagram {MapCJ (fJ X, fJ Y )}J∈J is in-
jectively ﬁbrant. For this, it will suﬃce to show that {MapCJ (fJ X, fJ Y )}J∈J has the right lifting property
with respect to every weak trivial coﬁbration α : F → F ′ of diagrams F, F ′ : J → S. Let G : J → CatS be
deﬁned by the formula G(J) = [1]F (J), and let G′ : J → CatS be deﬁned likewise. The desired result now
follows from the observe that α induces a weak trivial coﬁbration G → G′ in Fun(J, CatS).

Corollary A.3.2.28. Let S be an excellent model category, J a small category, and {CJ }J∈J a diagram of
S-enriched categories. Suppose given S-enriched functors

D β

→ C α→ lim{CJ }J∈J

such that α ◦ β exhibits D as a homotopy limit of the diagram {CJ }J∈J. Then the following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The functor α exhibits C as a homotopy limit of the diagram {CJ }J∈J.

(2) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the functor α exhibits MapC(X, Y ) as a homotopy limit of the

diagram {MapCJ (αJ X, αJ Y )}J∈J.

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) follows from Proposition A.3.2.27. To prove the converse, we may assume
that the diagram {CJ }J∈J is injectively ﬁbrant. In view of (2), Proposition A.3.2.27 implies that α induces
a fully faithful functor between hS-enriched homotopy categories. It will therefore suﬃce to show that α
is essentially surjective on homotopy categories, which follows from our assumption that α ◦ β is a weak
equivalence.

A.3.3 Model Structures on Diagram Categories

In this section, we consider enriched analogues of the constructions presented in §A.2.8. Namely, suppose
that S is an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched model category, and C a small S-enriched
category. Let AC denote the category of S-enriched functors from C to A. In this section, we will study the
associated projective and injective model structures on AC. The ideas described here will be used in §A.3.4
to construct certain mapping objects in CatS.

We begin with the analogue of Deﬁnition A.2.8.1.

Deﬁnition A.3.3.1. Let C be a small S-category, and A a combinatorial S-enriched model category. A
natural transformation α : F → G in AC is a:

• injective coﬁbration if the induced map F (C) → G(C) is a coﬁbration in A, for each C ∈ C.

• projective ﬁbration if the induced map F (C) → G(C) is a ﬁbration in A, for each C ∈ C.

• weak equivalence if the induced map F (C) → G(C) is a weak equivalence in A, for each C ∈ C.

• injective ﬁbration if it has the right lifting property with respect to every morphism β in AC which is

simultaneously a weak equivalence and a injective coﬁbration.

• projective coﬁbration if it has the left lifting property with respect to every morphism β in AC which

is simultaneously a weak equivalence and a projective ﬁbration.

Proposition A.3.3.2. Let S be an excellent model category, A be a combinatorial S-enriched model category,
and let C be a small S-enriched category. Then there exist two combinatorial model structures on AC:

• The projective model structure, determined by the strong coﬁbrations, weak equivalences, and projective

ﬁbrations.

• The injective model structure, determined by the weak coﬁbrations, weak equivalences, and injective

ﬁbrations.

The proof of Proposition A.3.3.2 is identical to that of Proposition A.2.8.2, except that it requires the

following more general form of Lemma A.2.8.3:

Lemma A.3.3.3. Let A be a presentable category which is enriched, tensored, and cotensored over another
presentable category S. Let S0 be a (small) set of morphisms of A, and let S0 be the weakly saturated class of
morphisms generated by S0. Let C be a small S-enriched category. Let
S be the collection of all morphisms
F → G in AC with the following property: for every C ∈ C, the map F (C) → G(C) belongs to S0. Then there
exists a (small) set of morphisms S of AC which generates

S (as a weakly saturated class of morphisms).

e

We will defer the proof until the end of this section.

e

Remark A.3.3.4. In the situation of Proposition A.3.3.2, the category AC is again enriched, tensored and
cotensored over S. Tensor product with an object K ∈ S is computed pointwise; in other words, if F ∈ AC,
then we have the formula

(K ⊗ F)(A) = K ⊗ F(A).
Using criterion (2′) of Remark A.3.1.6, we deduce that AC is a S-enriched model category with respect to
the injective model structure. A dual argument (using criterion (2′′) of Remark A.3.1.6) shows that AC is
also a S-enriched model category with respect to the projective model structure.
Remark A.3.3.5. For each object C ∈ C and each A ∈ A, let FC

A ∈ AC be the functor given by

D 7→ A ⊗ MapC(C, D).
As in the proof of Proposition A.2.8.2, we learn that the class of projective coﬁbrations in AC is generated by
coﬁbrations of the form j : FC
A′ , where A → A′ is a coﬁbration in A. It follows that every projective
coﬁbration is a injective coﬁbration; dually, every injective ﬁbration is a projective ﬁbration.

A → FC

As in §A.2.8, the construction (C, A) 7→ AC is functorial in both C and A. We summarize the situation

in the following propositions, whose proofs are left to the reader:

Proposition A.3.3.6. Let S be an excellent model category, C a small S-enriched model category, and

A

F

G

/S

a S-enriched Quillen adjunction between combinatorial S-enriched model categories. The compo-

sition with F and G determines another S-enriched Quillen adjunction

AC F C
GC

/ BC

,

with respect to either the projective or injective model structures. Moreover, if (F, G) is a Quillen equivalence,
then (F C, GC) is also a Quillen equivalence.

Because the projective and injective model structures on AC have the same weak equivalences, the
identity functor idAC is a Quillen equivalence between them. However, it is important to keep distinguish
these two model structures, because they have diﬀerent variance properties as we now explain.

Let f : C → C′ be a S-enriched functor. Then composition with f yields a pullback functor f ∗ : AC′
→
AC. Since A has all S-enriched limits and colimits, f ∗ has a right adjoint which we shall denote by f∗ and
a left adjoint which we shall denote by f!.

Proposition A.3.3.7. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched model category,
and f : C → C′ a S-enriched functor between small S-enriched categories. Let f ∗ : AC′
→ AC be given by
composition with f . Then f ∗ admits a right adjoint f∗ and a left adjoint f!. Moreover:

(1) The pair (f!, f ∗) determines a Quillen adjunction between the projective model structures on AC and

AC′

.

(2) The pair (f ∗, f∗) determines a Quillen adjunction between the injective model structures on AC and

AC′

.

We now study some aspects of the theory which are unique to the enriched context.

Proposition A.3.3.8. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched model category,
and f : C → C′ an equivalence of small S-enriched categories. Then:

(1) The Quillen adjunction (f!, f ∗) determines a Quillen equivalence between the projective model structures

on AC and AC′

.

(2) The Quillen adjunction (f ∗, f∗) determines a Quillen equivalence between the injective model structures

on AC and AC′

.

Proof. We ﬁrst note that (1) and (2) are equivalent: they are both equivalent to the assertion that f ∗
induces an equivalence on homotopy categories. It therefore suﬃces to prove (1). We ﬁrst prove this under
the following additional assumption:

(∗) For every pair of objects C, D ∈ C′, the map

is a coﬁbration in S.

MapC′ (C, D) → MapC(f (C), f (D))

Let Lf! : AC → AC′

denote the left derived functor of f!. We must show that the unit and counit maps

hF : F 7→ f ∗Lf!F

686

/
o
o
/
o
o
kG : Lf!f ∗G → G
are isomorphisms for all F ∈ hAC, G ∈ hAC. Since f is essentially surjective on homotopy categories, a
natural transformation K → K ′ of S-enriched functors K, K ′ : C′ → A is a weak equivalence if and only if
f ∗K → f ∗K ′ is a weak equivalence. Consequently, to prove kG is an isomorphism, it suﬃces to show that
hf ∗G is an isomorphism.

Let us say that a map F → F ′ in AC is good if the induced map f ∗f!F

F F ′ → f ∗f!F ′ is a weak
trivial coﬁbration. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that every projective coﬁbration is good.
Since the collection of good transformations is weakly saturated, it will suﬃce to show that each of the
generating coﬁbrations FC
A′ is good, where C ∈ C′ and j : A → A′ is a coﬁbration in A. Unwinding
the deﬁnitions, we must show that for each D ∈ C′ the induced map

A → FC

`

θ : (A′ ⊗ MapC′ (C, D))

(A ⊗ MapC(f (C), f (D))) → A′ ⊗ MapC(f (C), f (D))

aA⊗MapC′ (C,D)

is a trivial coﬁbration. This follows from the fact that j is a coﬁbration and our assumption (∗).

We now treat the general case. First, choose a trivial coﬁbration g : C → C′′, where C′′ is ﬁbrant. Then
g satisﬁes (∗), so g! is a Quillen equivalence. By a two-out-of-three argument, we see that f! is a Quillen
equivalence if and only if (g ◦ f )! is a Quillen equivalence. Replacing C by C′′, we may reduce to the case
where C is itself ﬁbrant.

C′ → D, where D is ﬁbrant and equivalent to the ﬁnal object of CatS. Then

Choose a coﬁbration j : C

f factors as a composition

`

→ C × D f ′′
Since C and D are ﬁbrant, the product C × D is equivalent to C. Moreover, the map f ′′ admits a section
s : C → C × D. Using another two-out-of-three argument, it will suﬃce to show that f ′
! and s! are Quillen
equivalences. For this, it will suﬃce to show that f ′ and s satisfy (∗).

C′ f ′

→ C .

We ﬁrst show that f ′ satisﬁes (∗). Fix a pair of objects X, Y ∈ C′. Then f ′ induces the composite map

MapC′(X, Y ) u→ MapC(f X, f Y ) × MapC′(X, Y ) u′

→ MapC(f X, f Y ) × MapD(jX, jY ) ≃ MapC × D(f ′X, f ′Y ).

The map u is a monomorphism (since it admits a left inverse), and therefore a coﬁbration in view of axiom
(A2) of Deﬁnition A.3.2.16. The map u′ is a product of coﬁbrations, and therefore a coﬁbration (again by
axiom (A2)).

The proof that s satisﬁes (∗) is similar: for every pair of objects U, V ∈ C, the map

MapC(U, V ) → MapC × D(sU, sV ) ≃ MapC(U, V ) × MapD(jU, jV )

is a monomorphism since it admits a left inverse, and is therefore a coﬁbration.

In the special case where f : C → C′ is a coﬁbration between S-enriched categories, we have some

additional functoriality:
Proposition A.3.3.9. Let S be an excellent model category and let f : C → C′ be a coﬁbration of small
S-enriched categories. Then:

(1) For every combinatorial S-enriched model category A, the pullback map f ∗ : AC′

→ AC preserves

projective coﬁbrations.

(2) For every projectively coﬁbrant object F ∈ SC, the unit map F → f ∗f!F is a projective coﬁbration.

of S-enriched categories, where j : S → S′ is a coﬁbration in S. Let C be an object of C, and let F ∈ SC be
the functor given by the formula D 7→ MapC(C, D). Then the unit map F → f ∗f!F is a projective coﬁbration
in SC.

Proof. The map i determines a pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, and a map S → MapC(X, Y ). The proof of
Proposition A.3.2.4 shows that the functor f ∗f!F is the colimit of a sequence

F = F (0)

h1→ F (1)

h2→ F (2) → . . . ,

where each hk is a pushout of a map FY
can be identiﬁed with the tensor product

A → FY

A′ induced by a map t : A → A′ in S. Moreover, the map t

idMapC(C,X) ⊗ id⊗k−1

MapC(Y,X) ⊗ ∧k (j),

where ∧k(j) denotes the kth pushout power of j. It follows that t is a coﬁbration in S, so that each hk is a
projective coﬁbration in SC.

Proof of Proposition A.3.3.9. The collection of S-enriched functors f which satisfy (1) and (2) is clearly
closed under the formation of retracts. We may there assume without loss of generality that f is a transﬁ-
nite composition of pushouts of generating coﬁbrations (see the discussion preceding Proposition A.3.2.4).
Reordering these pushouts if necessary, we can factor f as a composition

C f ′

→ C f ′′

→ C′

where C is obtained from C by freely adjoining a collection of new objects, and f ′′ is bijective on objects.
Since f ′ clearly satisﬁes (1) and (2), it will suﬃce to prove that f ′′ satisﬁes (1) and (2). Replacing f by f ′′,
we may assume that f is bijective on objects.

We now show that (2) ⇒ (1). Since the functor f ∗ preserves colimits, the collection of morphisms α
such that f ∗ is a projective coﬁbration in AC is weakly saturated. It will therefore suﬃce to that
A′ denotes the corresponding

in AC′
for every object X ∈ C′ and every coﬁbration A → A′ in A, if α : FX
generating projective coﬁbration, then f ∗(α) is a projective coﬁbration in S.

A → FX

There is a canonical left Quillen bifunctor

⊠ : SC × A → AC

described by the formula (F ⊠ A)(C) = F (C) ⊗ A. (Here we regard SC as endowed with the projective model
structure.) We observe that f ∗(α) is the induced map (f ∗F ) ⊠ A → (f ∗F ) ⊠ A′, where F ∈ SC′
is given by
F (C′) = MapC′(X, C′). To prove (1), it will suﬃce to show that f ∗F is projectively coﬁbrant.

Since F is bijective on objects, we can choose an object X0 ∈ C such that f X0 = X. We now observe
that F ≃ f!F0, where F0 ∈ SC is deﬁned by the formula F0(C) = MapC(X0, C). If (2) is satisﬁed, then the
unit map F0 → f ∗F is a projective coﬁbration in SC. Since F0 is projectively coﬁbrant, we conclude that
f ∗F is projectively coﬁbrant as well. This completes the proof that (2) ⇒ (1).

To prove (2), let us write f as a transﬁnite composition of S-enriched functors

C = C0 → C1 → . . . ,

each of which is a pushout of a generating coﬁbration of the form [1]S → [1]S′, where S → S′ is a coﬁbration
in S. For each α ≤ β, let f β
α : Cα → Cβ be the corresponding coﬁbration. We will prove that the following
statement holds, for every pair of ordinals α ≤ β:

(2α,β) For every projectively coﬁbrant object F ∈ SCα , the unit map u : F → (f β

α )∗(f β

α )!F is a projective

coﬁbration.

688

The proof proceeds by induction on β. We observe that u is a transﬁnite composition of maps of the

form

uγ : (f γ

α )∗(f γ

α )!F → (f γ

α)∗(f γ+1
γ

)∗(f γ+1
γ

)!(f γ

α)!F,

It will therefore suﬃce to show that each uγ is a projective coﬁbration. Our inductive
where γ < β.
hypothesis therefore guarantees that (2α,γ) holds, so the ﬁrst part of the proof shows that (f γ
α)∗ preserves
trivial coﬁbrations. We are therefore reduced to proving assertion (2γ,γ+1). In other words, to prove (2)
in general, it will suﬃce to treat the case in which f is a pushout of a generating coﬁbration of the form
[1]S → [1]S′.

We will in fact prove the following stronger version of (2):

(3) For every projective coﬁbration φ : F ′ → F in SC, the induced map φ′ : F

again a projective coﬁbration in SC.

F ′ f ∗f!F ′ → f ∗f!F is

`

Consider the collection of all morphisms φ : F ′ → F in SC such that the induced map φ′ : F
F ′ f ∗f!F ′ →
f ∗f!F is a projective coﬁbration. It is easy to see that this collection is weakly saturated. Consequently, to
prove (3) it suﬃces to treat the case where φ is a generating projective coﬁbration of the form FC
A → FC
A′ ,
where A → A′ is a coﬁbration in S. In this case, we can identify φ′ with the map

`

(FC ⊠ A′)

(f ∗f!FC ⊠ A) → f ∗f!FC ⊠ A′,

aFC ⊠A

where FC ∈ SC is the functor D 7→ MapC(C, D). Since ⊠ is a left Quillen bifunctor, it will suﬃce to show
that the unit map fC → f ∗f!FC is a projective coﬁbration in SC. This is precisely the content of Lemma
A.3.3.10.

In §A.2.8, we introduced the deﬁnitions of homotopy limits and colimits in an arbitrary combinatorial
model category A. We now discuss an analogous construction in the case where A is enriched over an
excellent model category S. To simplify the exposition, we will discuss only the case of homotopy limits; the
case of homotopy colimits is entirely dual and left to the reader.

Fix an excellent model category S and a combinatorial S-enriched model category A. Let f : C → C′ be

a functor between small S-enriched categories, so that we have an induced Quillen adjunction

We will refer to the right derived functor Rf∗ as the homotopy right Kan extension functor. If we are given
a pair of functors F ∈ AC, G ∈ AC′
. We will say that η exhibits
G as the homotopy right Kan extension of F if, for some weak equivalence F → F ′ where F ′ is injectively
ﬁbrant in AC, the composite map G → f∗F → f∗F ′ is a weak equivalence in AC′
. Since f∗ preserves weak
equivalences between injectively ﬁbrant objects, this condition is independent of the choice of F ′.

, and let η : G → f∗F be a map in AC′

Remark A.3.3.11. In §A.2.8, we deﬁned homotopy right Kan extensions in the setting of the diagram
categories Fun(C, A), where C is an ordinary category. In fact, this is a special case of the above construction.
Namely, there is a unique colimit-preserving monoidal functor F : Set → S, given by F (S) =
s∈S 1S.
We can therefore deﬁne a S-enriched category C whose objects are the objects of C, with MapC(X, Y ) =
F MapC(X, Y ). We now observe that we have an identiﬁcation Fun(C, A) ≃ AC, which is functorial in both
C and A. This identiﬁcation is compatible with the deﬁnition of the injective model structures on both sides,
so that either point of view gives rise to the same theory of homotopy right Kan extensions.

`

We now discuss a special feature of the enriched theory of homotopy Kan extensions: they can be reduced

to the theory of homotopy Kan extensions in the model category S:

Proposition A.3.3.12. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial model category enriched
over S, and let f : C → C′ be a functor between small S-enriched categories. Suppose given objects F ∈ AC,
G ∈ AC′
, and a map η : G → f∗F . Assume that F and G are projectively ﬁbrant. The following conditions
are equivalent:

(1) The map η exhibits G as a homotopy right Kan extension of F .

(2) For each coﬁbrant object A ∈ A, the induced map

ηA : GA → f∗FA

exhibits GA as a homotopy right Kan extension of FA. Here FA ∈ SC and GA ∈ SC′
FA(C) = MapA(A, F (C)), GA(C) = MapA(A, G(C)).

are deﬁned by

(3) For every ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object A ∈ A, the induced map

exhibits GA as a homotopy right Kan extension of FA.

ηA : GA → f∗FA

Proof. Choose an equivalence F → F ′, where F ′ is injectively ﬁbrant. We note that the induced maps
FA → F ′
A are weak equivalences for any coﬁbrant A ∈ A, since MapA(A, •) preserves weak equivalences
between ﬁbrant objects. Consequently, we may without loss of generality replace F by F ′ and thereby
assume that F is injectively ﬁbrant.

Now suppose that A is any coﬁbrant object of A; we claim that FA is injectively ﬁbrant. To show that FA
has the right lifting property with respect to a trivial weak coﬁbration H → H ′ of functors C → S, one need
only observe that F has the right lifting property with respect to trivial injective coﬁbration A⊗ H → A⊗ H ′
in AC.

Now we note that (1) is equivalent to the assertion that η is a weak equivalence, (2) is equivalent to the
assertion that ηA is a weak equivalence for any coﬁbrant object A, and (3) is equivalent to the assertion that
ηA is a weak equivalence whenever A is ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant. Because MapA(A, •) preserves weak equivalences
between ﬁbrant objects, we deduce that (1) ⇒ (2). It is clear that (2) ⇒ (3). We will complete the proof
by showing that (3) ⇒ (1). Assume that (3) holds; we must show that η(C′) : G(C′) → f∗F (C′) is an
isomorphism in the homotopy category hA, for each C′ ∈ C′. For this, it suﬃces to show that G(C′) and
f∗F (C′) represent the same H-valued functors on the homotopy category hA, which is precisely the content
of (3).

Remark A.3.3.13. It follows from Proposition A.3.3.12 that we can make sense of homotopy right Kan
extensions for diagrams which do not take values in a model category. Let f : C → C′ be a S-enriched
functor as in the discussion above, and let A be an arbitrary locally ﬁbrant S-enriched category. Suppose
given objects F ∈ AC, G ∈ AC′
, and η : f ∗G → F we say that η exhibits G as a homotopy right Kan
extension of F if, for each object A ∈ A, the induced map

ηA : GA → f∗FA

exhibits GA ∈ SC′

as a homotopy right Kan extension of FA ∈ SC.

Suppose that the monoidal structure on S is given by the Cartesian product, and take C′ to be the ﬁnal
object of CatS, so that we can identify AC′
with A. In this case, we can identify G with a single object
B ∈ A, and the map η with a collection of maps {B → F (C)}C∈C. We will say that η exhibits B as a
homotopy limit of F if it identiﬁes G with a homotopy right Kan extension of F . In other words, η exhibits
B as a homotopy limit of F if, for every object A ∈ A, the induced map

MapA(A, B) → lim{MapA(A, F (C))}C∈C

690

exhibits MapA(A, B) as a homotopy limit of the diagram {MapA(A, F (C)}C∈C in the model category S.

We also have a dual notion of homotopy colimit in an arbitrary ﬁbrant S-enriched category A: a com-
patible family of maps {F (C) → B}C∈C exhibits B as a homotopy colimit of F if, for every object A ∈ A,
the induced maps {MapA(B, A) → MapA(F (C), A)}C∈C exhibit MapA(B, A) as a homotopy limit of the
diagram {MapA(F (C), A)}C∈C in S.

Remark A.3.3.14. In view of Proposition A.3.3.12, the terminology introduced in Remark A.3.3.13 for
general A agrees with the terminology introduced for a combinatorial S-enriched model category A if we set
A = A◦. We remark that, in general, the two notions do not agree if we take A = A, so that our terminology
is potentially ambiguous; however, we feel that there is little danger of confusion.

We conclude this section by giving the proof of Lemma A.3.3.3. Let A be a presentable category which
is enriched, tensored, and cotensored over a presentable category S. Let C be a small S-enriched category,
and S0 a weakly saturated class of morphisms of A generated by a (small) set S0. We regard this data as
ﬁxed for the remainder of this section.

Choose a regular cardinal κ satisfying the following conditions:

(i) The cardinal κ is uncountable.

(ii) The category C has fewer than κ-objects.

(iii) Let X, Y ∈ C, and let K = MapC(X, Y ). Then the functor from A to itself given by the formula
A 7→ AK preserves κ-ﬁltered colimits. This implies, in particular, that the collection of κ-compact
objects of A is stable with respect to the functors • ⊗ K.

(iv) The category A is κ-accessible. It follows also that AC is κ-accessible, and that an object F ∈ AC is
κ-compact if and only if each F (C) ∈ A is κ-compact. We prove an ∞-category generalization of this
statement as Proposition 5.4.4.3. The same proof also works in the setting of ordinary categories.

(v) The source and target of every morphism in S0 is a κ-compact object of A.

Enlarging S0 if necessary, we may assume that S0 consists of all morphisms in f ∈ S0 such that the
source and target of f are κ-compact. Let S be the collection of all injective coﬁbrations between κ-compact
objects of A (in view of (iv), we can equally well deﬁne S to be the set of morphisms F → G in AC such
that each of the induced morphisms F (C) → G(C) belongs to S0). Let S be the weakly saturated class of
morphisms in AC generated by S, and choose a map f : F → G in AC such that f (C) ∈ S0 for each C ∈ C.
We wish to show that f ∈ S. Corollary A.1.5.13 implies that, for each C ∈ C, there exists a κ-good S0-tree
{Y (C)α}α∈A(C) with root F (C) and colimit G(C).
Let us deﬁne a slice to be the following data:

(a) For each object C ∈ C, a downward-closed subset B(C) ⊆ A(C).

(b) For every object C ∈ C, a morphism ηC :

Lemma A.3.3.15. Suppose given a collection of κ-small subsets {B0(C) ⊆ A(C)}C∈C. Then there exists a
slice {(B(C), ηC }C∈C such that each B(C) is a κ-small subset of A(C) containing B0(C).

Proof. Enlarging each B0(C) if necessary, we may assume that each B0(C) is closed downwards. Note that
because each {Y (C)α}α∈A(C) is a κ-good S0-tree, if A′ ⊆ A(C) is closed downward and κ-small, Y (C)A′ is
κ-compact when viewed as an object of AF (C)/. It follows from (iii) that each Y (C)B0(C) ⊗ MapA(C, C′) is
a κ-compact object of A(F (C)⊗MapA(C,C ′))/. Consequently, each composition

We now introduce a bit more terminology. Suppose given a pair of slices M = {(B(C), ηC )}C∈C, M ′ =

{(B′(C), η′
if B(C) ⊆ B′(C) for each C ∈ C, and each diagram

Y (C)B(C) → Y (C)B(C ′) constitute a natural transformation of simplicial functors from C to A.

Lemma A.3.3.16. Let M ′ = {(A′(C), θC )}C∈C be a slice, and let {B0(C) ⊆ A(C)}C∈C be a collection of
κ-small subsets of A(C). Then there exists a pair of slices N = {(B(C), ηC )}C∈C, N ′ = {(B(C)∩A′(C), η′
C )}
where B(C) is κ-small, and N ′ is compatible with both N and M ′.

Proof. Let B′
{(Bi(C), η(i)C )}, N ′

0(C) = A′(C) ∩ B0(C). For every positive integer i, we will construct a pair of slices Ni =

i = {(B′

i(C), η′(i)C )} so that the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(a) Each Bi(C) is κ-small and contains Bi−1(C).

(b) Each B′

i(C) is κ-small, contains B′

i−1(C) and the intersection Bi(C)∩A′(C), and is contained in A′(C).

(c) Each N ′

i is compatible with M ′.

assemble to a slice N ′ = {(B(C) ∩ A′(C), η′

We now construct a transﬁnite sequence of compatible slices {M (γ) = {(B(γ)(C), η(γ)C )}C∈C}γ<β.
The construction is by recursion. Assume that M (γ′) has been deﬁned for γ′ < γ, and let M ′(γ) =
{(B′(γ)(C), η′(γ)C )}C∈C be the slice obtained by amalgamating the family {M (γ′)}γ′<γ.
If B′(γ)(C) =
A(C) for all C ∈ C, we set β = γ and conclude the construction. Otherwise, choose C ∈ C and a ∈
A(C) − B′(γ)(C). According to Lemma A.3.3.16, there exists a pair of slices N (γ) = {(B′′(C), θC )}C∈C,
C }C∈C such that N ′(γ) is compatible with both N (γ) and M ′(γ). We now
N ′(γ) = {(B′′(C) ∩ B′(γ)(C), θ′
deﬁne M (γ) to be the slice obtained by amalgamating M ′(γ) and N (γ).

For γ < β, let G(γ) : C → A be the simplicial functor corresponding to the slice M (γ). Then we have a

Y (C)B(γ)(C). Since B(γ)(C) − B′(γ)(C) is κ-small, Remark A.1.5.5, Lemma A.1.5.11 and Lemma A.1.5.6
imply that fγ is the pushout of a morphism belonging to S0. We now conclude by applying the following
result (replacing G by G(γ) and F by lim

Proof. In view of (iv), we can write F as the colimit of a diagram {Fλ}λ∈P indexed by a κ-ﬁltered partially
ordered set P , where each Fλ is a κ-compact object of AC, and is therefore a functor whose values are
κ-compact objects of A. Since each XC ∈ A is κ-compact, the map XC → F (C) factors through Fλ(C)(C)
for some suﬃciently large λ(C) ∈ P . Since C has fewer than κ objects and P is κ-ﬁltered, we can choose a

A.3.4 Path Spaces in S-Enriched Categories

Let S be a excellent model category. We have seen that there exists a model structure on the category CatS
of S-enriched categories, whose ﬁbrant objects are precisely those categories which are enriched over the full
subcategory S◦ of ﬁbrant objects of S.

The theory of model categories provides a plethora of examples: for every S-enriched model category A,
the full subcategory A◦ ⊆ A of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects is a ﬁbrant object of CatS. In other words, A◦ is
suitable to use for computing the homotopy set [C, A◦] = HomhCatS(C, A◦): if C is coﬁbrant, then every map
from C to A◦ in the homotopy category of CatS is represented by an actual S-enriched functor from C to
A◦. Moreover, two simplicial functors F, F ′ : C → A◦ represent the same morphism in hCatS if and only if
they are homotopic to one another. The relation of homotopy can be described either in terms of a cylinder
object for C or a path object for A◦. Unfortunately, it is rather diﬃcult to construct a cylinder object for
C explicitly, since the coﬁbrations in CatS are diﬃcult to describe directly even when S = Set∆ (the class
of coﬁbrations of simplicial categories is not stable under products, so the usual procedure of constructing
mapping cylinders via “product with an interval” cannot be applied). On the other hand, Theorem A.3.2.24
gives a good understanding of the ﬁbrations in CatS, which will allow us to give a very explicit construction
of a path object for A◦.

Let A be a S-enriched model category. Our goal in this section is to give a direct construction of a path

space object for A◦ in CatS. In other words, we wish to supply a diagram of S-enriched categories

A◦ → P (A) → A◦ × A◦

where the composite map is the diagonal, the left map is a weak equivalence, and the right map is a ﬁbration.
For technical reasons, we will ﬁnd it convenient to work not with the entire category A, but some (usually
small) subcategory thereof. For this reason, we introduce the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition A.3.4.1. Let S be an excellent model category, and let A be a combinatorial S-enriched model
category. A chunk of A is a full subcategory U ⊆ A with the following properties:

(a) Let A be an object of U, and let {φi : A → Bi}i∈I be a ﬁnite collection of morphisms in U. Then there

If U is a chunk of A, we let U◦ denote the full subcategory A◦ ∩ U ⊆ U consisting of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant

i∈I φi, where p is a coﬁbration, q a trivial ﬁbration, and A ∈ U. Moreover, this

`

ai∈I

objects of A which belong to U.

We will say that two chunks U, U′ ⊆ A are equivalent if they have the same essential image in the

homotopy category hA.

Remark A.3.4.2. In particular, if U is a chunk of A, then each object A ∈ U admits (functorial) ﬁbrant
and coﬁbrant replacements which also belong to U (take the set I to be empty in (a) and (b)).
Remark A.3.4.3. If U ⊆ U′ ⊆ A are equivalent chunks of A, then the inclusion U◦ ⊆ U′◦

is a weak

Example A.3.4.4. Let S be an excellent model category, and A a combinatorial S-enriched model category.
Then A is a chunk of itself; this follows from the small object argument.
Example A.3.4.5. Let U ⊆ A be a chunk, and let {Xα} be a collection of objects in A. Let V ⊆ U be the
full subcategory spanned by those objects X ∈ U such that there exists an isomorphism [X] ≃ [Xα] in the
homotopy category hA. Then V is also a chunk of A.

We will prove a general existence theorem for chunks below (see Lemma A.3.4.15).

Lemma A.3.4.6. Let S be an excellent model category, and let C be a small S-enriched category. Then there
exists a weak equivalence of S-enriched categories C → U◦, where U is a chunk of a combinatorial S-enriched
category A.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that C is ﬁbrant. Let A = SCop
, endowed with the
projective model structure. We can identify C with a full subcategory of A◦ via the Yoneda embedding.
Using Lemma A.3.4.15, we can enlarge C to a chunk in A having the same image in the homotopy category
hA.

Notation A.3.4.7. Let S be an excellent model category, let A be a combinatorial S-enriched model
category, and let U be a chunk of A. We deﬁne a new category P (U) as follows:

(i) The objects of P (U) are ﬁbrations φ : A → B × C in A, where A, B, C ∈ U◦, and the composite maps

A → B and A → C are weak equivalences.

(ii) Morphisms in P (U) are given by maps of diagrams

We let π, π′ : P (U) → U◦ be the functors described by the formulas

π(φ : A → B × C) = B

π′(φ : A → B × C) = C.

We observe that both π and π′ have the structure of S-enriched functors.
Invoking assumption (a) of
Proposition A.3.4.1, we deduce the existence of another S-enriched functor τ : U◦ → P (U), which carries an
object A ∈ A◦ to the map q appearing in a functorial factorization

of the diagonal, where p is a trivial coﬁbration and q is a ﬁbration.

Theorem A.3.4.8. Let S be an excellent model category, let A be a combinatorial S-enriched model category,
and let U be a chunk of A. Then the morphisms π, π′ : P (U) → U◦ and τ : U◦ → P (U) furnish P (U) with
the structure of a path object for U◦ in CatS.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that π × π′ is a ﬁbration of S-enriched categories. In view of Theorem A.3.2.24, it will
suﬃce to show that π × π′ is a local ﬁbration. Let φ : A → B × C and φ′ : A′ → B′ × C′ be objects of P (U).
We must show that the induced map

MapP (U)(φ, φ′) → MapA(B, B′) × MapA(C, C′)

is a ﬁbration in S. This map is a base change of

MapA(A, A′) → MapA(A, B′ × C′),

which is a ﬁbration in virtue of the assumption that φ′ is a ﬁbration (since A is assumed to be coﬁbrant).

To complete the proof that π × π′ is a quasi-ﬁbration, we must show that if φ : A → B × C is an object of
P (U) and we are given weak equivalences f : B → B′, g : C → C′, then we can lift f and g to an equivalence
in P (U). To do so, we factor the composite map A → B′ × C′ as a trivial coﬁbration A → A′ followed by a
ﬁbration φ′ : A′ → B′ × C′. Since U is a chunk of A, we may assume that A′ ∈ U so that φ′ ∈ P (U). We have
an evident natural transformation α : φ → φ′. We will show below that π : P (U) → U◦ is an equivalence of
S-enriched categories; since π(α) = f is an isomorphism in hU◦, we conclude that α is an isomorphism in
hP (U) as required.

To complete the proof, we must show that τ is a weak equivalence of S-enriched categories. By the
two-out-of-three property, it will suﬃce to show that π is a weak equivalence of S-enriched categories. Since
τ is a section of π, it is clear that π is essentially surjective. It remains only to prove that π is fully faithful.
Let φ : A → B × C and φ′ : A′ → B′ × C′ be objects of P (U); we wish to show that the induced map
p : MapP (U)(φ, φ′) → MapA(B, B′) is a weak equivalence in S. We have a commutative diagram

MapP (U)(φ, φ′)

MapA(A, A′)

u

MapA(B, B′) × MapA(C, C′)

MapA(B, B′) × MapA(A, C′)

/ MapA(A, B′) × MapA(A, C′)

MapA(B, B′)

/ MapA(A, B′).

We note that, since the map A → B is a weak equivalence between coﬁbrant objects, and B′ is ﬁbrant,
the bottom horizontal map is a weak equivalence in S. Consequently, to show that the top horizontal map
is a weak equivalence in S, it will suﬃce to show that each square in the diagram is homotopy Cartesian.
The bottom square is Cartesian and ﬁbrant, so there is nothing to prove. The middle square is homotopy
Cartesian because both of the middle vertical maps are weak equivalences. The upper square is a pullback
square between ﬁbrant objects of S, and the map u is a ﬁbration; we now complete the proof by invoking
Proposition A.2.4.4.

Fix an excellent model category S. The symmetric monoidal structure on S induces a symmetric monoidal
structure on CatS: if C and D are S-enriched categories, then we can deﬁne a new S-enriched category C ⊗ D
as follows:

(i) The objects of C ⊗ D are pairs (C, D), where C ∈ C and D ∈ D.

(ii) Given a pair of objects (C, D), (C′, D′) ∈ C ⊗ D, we have

MapC ⊗ D((C, D), (C′, D′)) = MapC(C, C′) ⊗ MapD(D, D′) ∈ S.

In the case where the tensor product on S is the Cartesian product, this simply reduces to the usual product
of S-enriched categories.

Note that the operation ⊗ : CatS × CatS → CatS is not a left Quilen bifunctor, even when S = Set∆:
for example, a product of coﬁbrant simplicial categories is generally not coﬁbrant. Nevertheless, ⊗ behaves
much like a left Quillen bifunctor at the level of homotopy categories. For example, the operation ⊗ respects
weak equivalences in each argument, and therefore induces a functor ⊗ : hCatS × hCatS → hCatS, which is
characterized by the existence of natural isomorphisms [C ⊗ D] ≃ [C] ⊗ [D].

Our goal for the remainder of this section is to show that the monoidal structure ⊗ on CatS is closed:
that is, there exist internal mapping objects in hCatS. This is not completely obvious. It is easy to see that
the monoidal structure ⊗ on CatS is closed: given a pair of S-enriched categories C and D, the category
of S-enriched functors DC is itself S-enriched, and possesses the appropriate universal property. However,
this is not necessarily the “correct” mapping object, in the sense that the homotopy equivalence class [DC]
does not necessarily coincide with the internal mapping object [D][C] in hCatS. Roughly speaking, the
problem is that DC consists of functors which are strictly compatible with composition; the correct mapping
object should incorporate also functors which preserve composition only up to (coherent) weak equivalence.
However, when D is the category of ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects of a S-enriched model category A, then we can
proceed more directly.

Deﬁnition A.3.4.9. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched model category,
and C a coﬁbrant S-enriched category. We will say that a full subcategory U ⊆ A is a C-chunk of A if it is
a chunk of A and the subcategory UC is a chunk of AC. Here we regard AC as endowed with the projective
model structure.

Lemma A.3.4.10. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched model category, C
a (small) coﬁbrant S-enriched category, and U ⊆ A a C-chunk. Let f, f ′ : C → U◦ be a pair of maps. The
following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The homotopy classes [f ] and [f ′] coincide in HomhCatS(C, U◦).

(2) The maps f and f ′ are weakly equivalent when regarded as objects of AC.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. Using Theorem A.3.4.8, we deduce the existence of a homotopy
h : C → P (U) from f = π ◦ h to f ′ = π′ ◦ h. The map h determines another simplicial functor f ′′ : C → U,
equipped with weak equivalences f ′′ → f , f ′′ → f ′. This proves that f and f ′ are isomorphic in the
homotopy category of AC, so that (2) is satisﬁed.

Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. Since U is a C-chunk, we can ﬁnd a projectively coﬁbrant f ′′ : U → C
equipped with a weak equivalence α : f ′′ → f . Using (2), we deduce that there is also a weak equivalence
β : f ′′ → f ′. Using again the assumption that UC is a chunk of AC, we can choose a factorization of α × β
as a composition

f ′′ u→ f ′′′ v→ f × f ′
where u is a trivial projective coﬁbration, v is a projective ﬁbration, and f ′′′ ∈ UC. The map v can be viewed
as an object of P(U), which determines a right homotopy from f to f ′.

Corollary A.3.4.11. Let S be an excellent model category, and let f : C → C′ be a S-enriched func-
tor. Suppose that f is fully faithful in the sense that for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the induced map
MapC(X, Y ) → MapC′ (f X, f Y ) is a weak equivalence in S. Let D be an arbitrary S-enriched category.
Then:

(1) Composition with f induces an injective map φ : HomhCatS(D, C) → HomhCatS(D, C′).

699

(2) The image of φ consists of those maps g : D → C′ in hCatS such that the essential image of [g] in hC′

is contained in the essential image of [f ] in hC′.

Proof. Using Lemma A.3.4.6, we may assume without loss of generality that C′ = U◦, where U is a chunk of
a A-enriched model category. Let V ⊆ U be the full subcategory spanned by those objects which are weakly
equivalent to an object lying in the image of f . Since f is fully faithful, the induced map C → V◦ is a weak
equivalence. We may therefore assume that C = V◦.

Without loss of generality, we may suppose that D is coﬁbrant. Enlarging U and V if necessary (using
Lemma A.3.4.15), we may assume that U and V are D-chunks. The desired results now follow immediately
from Lemma A.3.4.10.

Let π0AC denote the collection of weak equivalence classes of objects in AC. Every equivalence class

contains a ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant representative, which determines a S-enriched functor C → A◦.

Proposition A.3.4.12. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched category, and
C a (small) coﬁbrant S-enriched category. Then the map

described above is bijective.

φ : π0AC → HomhCatS(C, A◦)

Proof. In view of Proposition A.3.3.8, we may assume that C is coﬁbrant. Lemma A.3.4.10 shows that φ is
well-deﬁned and injective. We show that φ is surjective. Let [f ] ∈ HomhCatS(C, U◦). Since C is coﬁbrant and
A◦ is ﬁbrant in CatS, we can ﬁnd a S-enriched functor f : C → A◦ representing [f ]. The simplicial functor
f takes values in ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects of A, but is not necessarily ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant as an object of AC.
However, we can choose a weak trivial ﬁbration f ′ → f , where f ′ is projectively coﬁbrant. Consequently,
it will suﬃce to show that a weak equivalence u : f ′ → f of S-enriched functors C → A◦ guarantees that
[f ] = [f ′] ∈ HomhCatS(C, A◦), which follows from Lemma A.3.4.10.

Proposition A.3.4.13. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched model category,
and C a small S-enriched category. Then the evaluation map e : (AC)◦ ⊗ C → A◦ has the following property:
for every small S-enriched category D, composition with e induces a bijection

Proof. Using Proposition A.3.4.12, we can identify both sides with π0AD ⊗ C.

HomhCatS(D, (AC)◦) → HomhCatS(C ⊗ D, A◦).

It is not clear that the conclusion of Proposition A.3.4.13 characterizes (AC)◦ up to equivalence, since
(AC)◦ is a large S-enriched category, and the proof of the Proposition only applies in the case where D is
small. To remedy this defect, we establish a more reﬁned version:

Corollary A.3.4.14. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched model category,
and C a small coﬁbrant S-enriched category. Let U be a C-chunk of A. Then the evaluation map e :
(UC)◦ ⊗ C → U◦ has the following property:
for every small S-enriched category D, composition with e
induces a bijection

HomhCatS(D, (UC)◦) → HomhCatS(C ⊗ D, U◦).

Proof. Combine Proposition A.3.4.13 with Corollary A.3.4.11.

We conclude this section with a technical result, which ensures the existence of a good supply of chunks

of combinatorial model categories.

Lemma A.3.4.15. Let S be an excellent model category, A a combinatorial S-enriched model category, and
{Cα}α∈A a (small) collection of (small) coﬁbrant S-enriched categories. Let U be a small full subcategory of
A. Then there exists a small subcategory V ⊆ A containing U, such that V is a Cα-chunk for each α ∈ A.
Moreover, we may arrange that U and V have the same essential image in the homotopy category hA.

Proof. Enlarging A if necessary, we may suppose that the collection {Cα}αinA includes the unit category
[0]S. For each α ∈ A, we can choose S-enriched functors

Fα : ACα ⊗[1]S → ACα ⊗[2]S

Gα : ACα ⊗[1]S → ACα ⊗[2]S,

such that F carries each morphism u : f → g in AC to a factorization

α be the functor

Choose a regular cardinal κ such that each Cα is κ-small. We deﬁne a sequence of full subcategories

{Uα ⊆ A}α<κ as follows:

(i) If α = 0, then Uα = U.

(ii) If α is a nonzero limit ordinal, then Uα =

β<α Uβ.

(iii) If α = β + 1, then Uα is the full subcategory of A spanned by the following:

It is readily veriﬁed that the subcategory V =

α<κ Uα has the desired properties.

A.3.5 Homotopy Colimits of S-Enriched Categories

S

Our goal in this section is to give an explicit construction of (certain) homotopy colimits in the model
category CatS, where S is an excellent model category. We begin with some general remarks concerning
localization.

Notation A.3.5.1. Consider the canonical map i : [1]S → [1]∼
as a composition

S . We ﬁx once and for all a factorization of i

i→ E i′
where i is a coﬁbration and i′ is a weak equivalence of S-enriched categories. For every S-enriched category
C and every map of sets W → HomCatS([1]S, C, we deﬁne a new S-enriched category C[W −1] by a pushout
diagram

E
admits a left inverse. Since C is ﬁbrant, it suﬃces to show that i′ is a trivial coﬁbration. The map i′ is a
coﬁbration since it is a pushout of i, and a weak equivalence because of the invertibility hypothesis.

Lemma A.3.5.3 immediately implies the following apparently stronger claim:

Lemma A.3.5.4. Let f0 : C → D be a S-enriched functor, where D is a ﬁbrant S-enriched category. Let
ψ : W → HomCatS ([1]S, C) be a map of sets. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map f0 extends to a map f : C[W −1] → D.

(2) For each w ∈ W , f0 carries the morphism φ(w) to an equivalence in D.

Proposition A.3.5.5. Let C and D be S-enriched categories, and let ψ : W → HomCatS([1]S, C) be a map
of sets. Then the induced map

φ : HomhCatS(C[W −1], D) → HomhCatS(C, D)

is injective, and its image is the subset HomW
classes of maps which induce functors hC → hD carrying each element of W to an isomorphism in hD.

hCatS(C, D) ⊆ HomhCatS(C, D) consisting of those homotopy

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that C is coﬁbrant and D is ﬁbrant. The description of
the image of φ follows immediately from Lemma A.3.5.4. It will therefore suﬃce to show that φ is injective.
Suppose we are given a pair of maps [f ], [g] ∈ HomhCatS(C[W −1], D) such that φ([f ]) = φ([g]). Since C[W −1]
is coﬁbrant, we may assume that [f ] and [g] are represented by actual S-enriched functors f, g : C[W −1] → D.
Moreover, the condition that φ([f ]) = φ([g]) guarantees that the restrictions f | C and g| C are homotopic.
We wish to show that f and g are homotopic.

Invoking Proposition A.2.3.1, we deduce that g is homotopic to a map g′ : C[W −1] → D such that
g′| C = f | C. Replacing g by g′ if necessary, we may assume that g| C = f | C. It will now suﬃce to show that
f and g are homotopic in the model category (CatS)C /. We observe that f and g determine a map

Let W be a collection of morphisms in M with the following properties:

(i) For each w ∈ W , j(w) is an identity morphism in D.

(ii) For every object C ∈ C, the morphism C → f C in M classifying the identity map from f C to itself

belongs to W .

Assumption (i) implies that the map j canonically extends to a map j : M[W −1] → D. The map j is a weak
equivalence of S-enriched categories.

Proof. It will suﬃce to show that composition with j induces a bijection

for every S-enriched category A. Equivalently, we must show that the map

HomhCatS(D, A) → HomhCatS(M[W −1], A)

t : HomhCatS(D, A) → HomW

hCatS(M, A)

is bijective, where HomW
hCatS(M, A) is deﬁned as in Proposition A.3.5.5. The map t has a section t′, given
by composition with the inclusion D → M. It will therefore suﬃce to show that t ◦ t′ is the identity on
HomW

hCatS(M, A).
Using Lemma A.3.4.6 and Corollary A.3.4.11, we can reduce to the case where A = A◦, where A is
a combinatorial S-enriched model category. Invoking Proposition A.3.4.12, we deduce that every element
[g] ∈ HomhCatS(M, A) can be represented by a diagram g : M → A◦. We wish to prove that g and g ◦ i ◦ j
are homotopic. We observe that there is a canonical natural transformation α : g → g ◦ i ◦ j. Moreover,
if g carries each element of W to an equivalence in A◦, then assumption (ii) guarantees that α is a weak
equivalence in the model category AM. We now invoke Proposition A.3.4.12 to deduce that g and g ◦ i ◦ j
are homotopic as desired.

Deﬁnition A.3.5.7. Let A be a partially ordered set. An A-ﬁltered S-enriched category is a S-enriched
category C together with a map r : Ob(C) → A with the following property: if C, D ∈ C and r(C) (cid:2) r(D),
then MapC(C, D) ≃ ∅, where ∅ denotes an initial object of S.

If C is an A-ﬁltered S-enriched category and a ∈ A, then we let C≤a denote the full subcategory of C

spanned by those objects C ∈ C such that r(C) ≤ a.

Remark A.3.5.8. Let C be an A-ﬁltered S-enriched category, and let ψ : W → HomCatS ([1]S, C) be a map
of sets. For each a ∈ A, we let Wa ⊆ W be the subset consisting of those elements w ∈ W such that the
morphism ψ(w) belongs to Ca. This data determines a diagram χW : A → CatS, described by the formula
a 7→ C≤a[W −1

a ]. Moreover, we have a canonical isomorphism of S-enriched categories C[W −1] ≃ lim

(χ).

Using the small object argument, we easily deduce the following result:

703

Lemma A.3.5.9. Let A be a partially ordered set, and let C be an A-ﬁltered S-enriched category. Then
there exists a S-enriched functor f : C′ → C with the following properties:

(1) The functor f is bijective on objects, and for every pair of objects C, D ∈ C′, the map MapC(C, D) →
MapC(f C, f D) is a trivial ﬁbration in S. In particular, f is a weak equivalence of S-enriched categories.

(2) The A-ﬁltration on C induces an A-ﬁltration on C′. In other words, if C, D ∈ C′ and r(f C) (cid:2) r(f D),

then MapC′ (C, D) is an initial object of S.

(3) The diagram A → CatS described by the formula a 7→ C′

≤a is projectively coﬁbrant.

Proposition A.3.5.10. Let A be a partially ordered set, C be an A-ﬁltered S-enriched category, and ψ :
W → HomCatS([1]S, C) a map of sets. Let χ : A → CatS be deﬁned as in Remark A.3.5.8. Then the
isomorphism lim

χ ≃ C[W −1] exhibits C as the homotopy colimit of the diagram χ.

Proof. Choose a map C′ → C as in Lemma A.3.5.9, and choose a map ψ′ : W → HomCatS([1]S, C′) lifting
ψ, and let χ′ : A → CatS be deﬁned as in Remark A.3.5.8. Then we have a canonical map χ′ → χ, which
is a coﬁbrant replacement for χ in the model category Fun(A, CatS). It will therefore suﬃce to show that

Deﬁnition A.3.5.11. Let A be a partially ordered set, and let p : A → CatS be an A-indexed diagram of
S-enriched categories. Let us denote the image of a ∈ A under p by Ca.

The Grothendieck construction on p is a category Groth(p) deﬁned as follows:

(1) The objects of Groth(p) are pairs (a, C), where a ∈ A and C ∈ Ca.

(2) Given a pair of objects (a, C), (a′, C′) in Groth(p), we set

MapGroth(p)((a, C), (a′, C′)) =

otherwise.

Here pa′

a denotes the functor Ca → Ca′ determined by p, and ∅ denotes an initial object of S.

(3) Composition in Groth(p) is deﬁned in the obvious way.

We observe that Groth(p) is A-ﬁltered via the map r : Ob(Groth(p)) → A given by the formula r(a, C) =
a C), where

a. We let W (p) denote the collection of all morphisms in Groth(p) of the form α : (a, C) → (a′, pa′
a ≤ a′ and α corresponds to the identity in Ca′.

For each a ∈ A, there is a canonical functor πa : Groth(p)≤a → Ca, given by the formula (C, a′) 7→ pa
a′(C).
We note that π carries each element of W (p)a to an identity map in Ca, so that πa canonically extends to
a map πa : Groth(p)≤a[W (p)−1

diagrams χ(p) → p, where χ(p) is deﬁned as in Remark A.3.5.8.

Lemma A.3.5.12. Let p : A → CatS be as in Deﬁnition A.3.5.11. Then for each a ∈ A, the map
πa : Groth(p)≤a[W (p)−1

Proof. This is a special case of Lemma A.3.5.6.

Lemma A.3.5.13. Let p : A → CatS be as in Deﬁnition A.3.5.11. Then there is a canonical isomorphism
Groth(p)[W (p)−1] ≃ hocolim(p) in the homotopy category hCatS.

the canonical map

is bijective. Using Lemma A.3.4.6 and Corollary A.3.4.11, we can reduce to the case where A = A◦, where
A is a combinatorial S-enriched model category. We now invoke Propositions A.3.4.13 and A.3.5.5 to get a

A.3.6 Exponentiation in Model Categories

Let C be a category which admits ﬁnite products, containing a pair of objects X and Y . An exponential of
X by Y is an object X Y ∈ C together with a map e : X Y × Y → X, with the following universal property:
for every object W ∈ C, the composition

HomC(W, X Y ) → HomC(W × Y, X Y × Y ) ◦e→ HomC(W × Y, Z)

is bijective.

Our goal in this section is to study the existence of exponentials in the homotopy category of a model
category A. Suppose given a pair of objects X, Y ∈ A, such that there exists an exponential of [X] by
[Y ] in the homotopy category hA. We can then represent this exponential as [Z], for some object Z ∈ A.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that X, Y , and Z are ﬁbrant and coﬁbrant, so that we have a
canonical identiﬁcation [Z] × [Y ] ≃ [Z × Y ]. However, we encounter a technical diﬃculty: the evaluation
map [Z] × [Y ] → [X] need not be representable by any morphism from Z × Y to X in the category A,
because Z × Y need not be coﬁbrant. We wish to work in certain contexts where this diﬃculty does arise
(for example, where A is the category of simplicial categories). For this reason we are forced to work with
the following somewhat cumbersome deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition A.3.6.1. Let A be a model category. We will say that a diagram

exhibits Z as a weak exponential of X by Y if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) The map p exhibits P as a homotopy product of Z and Y ; in other words, the induced map [p] : [P ] →

[Z] × [Y ] is an isomorphism in the homotopy category hA.

(2) The composition [Z] × [Y ]

[p]−1
→ [P ] → [X] exhibits [Z] as an exponential of [X] by [Y ] in the homotopy

category hA.

We will say that a map Z × Y → X exhibits Z as an exponential of X by Y if the diagram

Z × Y

X

as in Deﬁnition A.3.6.1. We will say that this diagram is standard if X, Y, Z ∈ A are ﬁbrant, and the map
p is a trivial ﬁbration.

Suppose X and Y are ﬁbrant objects of A such that there exists an exponential of [X] by [Y ] in the
homotopy category hA. Without loss of generality, this exponential has the form [Z] where Z is a ﬁbrant
object of A. We can then choose a trivial ﬁbration P → Z × Y , where P is coﬁbrant. The evaluation map
[Z × Y ] ≃ [Z] × [Y ] → [X] is then representable by a map P → X in A, so that we obtain a standard diagram
which exhibits Z as a weak exponential of X by Y .

Remark A.3.6.3. Suppose given a diagram

only on the image of this diagram in the homotopy category hA. We are therefore replace the above diagram

To work eﬀectively with weak exponentials, we need to introduce an additional assumption.

Deﬁnition A.3.6.5. Let A be a combinatorial model category containing a ﬁbrant object Y . We will say
that multiplication by Y preserves homotopy colimits if the following condition is satisﬁed:

(∗) Let A be a (small) partially ordered set, let F : A → A be a projectively coﬁbrant diagram, and let
F ′ : A → A be another strongly coﬁbrant diagram equipped with a natural transformation F ′(a) →
F (a) × Y which is weak equivalence for each a ∈ A. Then the induced map lim
F ) × Y
−→
exhibits lim
−→

F ′ as a homotopy product of Y with lim
−→

F ′ → (lim
−→

F in A.

We will say that multiplication in A preserves homotopy colimits if condition (∗) is satisﬁed for every ﬁbrant
object Y ∈ A.

Remark A.3.6.6. Deﬁnition A.3.6.5 refers only to homotopy colimits indexed by partially ordered sets.
However, every diagram indexed by an arbitrary category can be replaced by a diagram indexed by a partially
ordered set having the same homotopy colimit. We formulate and prove a precise statement to this eﬀect (in
the language of ∞-categories) in §4.2. However, we will not need (or use) any such result in this appendix.

Remark A.3.6.7. Let A

F

G

/B

be a Quillen equivalence between combinatorial model categories, and

let Y ∈ B be a ﬁbrant object. Then multiplication by Y preserves homotopy colimits in B if and only if
multiplication by G(Y ) preserves homotopy colimits in A. Since the right derived functor RG is essentially
surjective on homotopy categories, we see that multiplication in B preserves homotopy colimits if and only
if multiplication in A preserves homotopy colimits.

Example A.3.6.8. Let S be an excellent model category with respect to the symmetric monoidal structure
given by Cartesian product in S. Then multiplication in CatS preserves homotopy colimits. This is precisely
the content of Theorem A.3.5.15.

Lemma A.3.6.9. Let S be a collection of simplicial sets satisfying the following conditions:

(i) The simplicial set ∆0 belongs to S.

(ii) If f : X → Y is a weak homotopy equivalence, then X ∈ S if and only if Y ∈ S.

(iii) For every small partially ordered set A, if F : A → Set∆ is a projectively coﬁbrant diagram such that

each F (a) ∈ S, then lim
−→

F ∈ S.

Proof. Using (ii) and (iii), we deduce that if F : A → Set∆ is any diagram such that each F (a) belongs to
S, then the homotopy colimit of F belongs to S. In particular, S is closed under the formation of coproducts
and homotopy pushouts.

We now prove by induction on n that every n-dimensional simplicial set X belongs to S. For this, we

observe that there is a homotopy pushout diagram

B × ∂ ∆n

/ B × ∆n

skn−1 X

/ X,

where B denotes the set of n-simplices of X. The simplicial sets B × ∂ ∆n and skn−1 X belong to S by the
inductive hypothesis. The simplicial set B × ∆n is weakly equivalent to the constant simplicial set B, which
belongs to S in view of (i) and the fact that S is stable under coproducts. Since S is stable under homotopy
pushouts, we conclude that X ∈ S as desired.

Assume further that multiplication by Y preserves homotopy colimits in A. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(i) The above diagram exhibits Z as a weak exponential of X by Y .

(ii) Let W and W ′ be coﬁbrant objects of A, and W ′ → W × Y a map which exhibits W ′ as a homotopy

product of W and Y . Then the induced map

MapA(W, Z) ×MapA(W ′,Z×Y ) MapA(W ′, P ) → MapA(W ′, X)

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes.

Remark A.3.6.11. In the situation of part (ii) of Proposition A.3.6.10, the projection map MapA(W ′, P ) →
MapA(W ′, Z × Y ) is a trivial Kan ﬁbration, so the ﬁber product MapA(W, Z) ×MapA(W ′,Z×Y ) MapA(W ′, P )
is automatically a Kan complex which is homotopy equivalent to MapA(W, Z).

Proof of Proposition A.3.6.10. First suppose that (ii) is satisﬁed. We wish to show that for every object
[W ] ∈ hA, the map

HomhA([W ], [Z]) → HomhA([W ] × [Y ], [Z] × [Y ]) ≃ HomhA([W ] × [Y ], [P ]) → HomhA([W ] × [Y ], [P ])

is bijective. Without loss of generality, we may assume that [W ] is the homotopy equivalence class of a
ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object W ∈ A. Choose a coﬁbrant replacement W ′ → W × Y . We observe that the map
in question can be identiﬁed with the composition

π0 MapA(W, Z) → π0 MapA(W ′, Z × Y ) ≃ π0 MapA(W ′, P ) → π0 MapA(W ′, X),

which is bijective in view of (ii) and Remark A.3.6.11.

We now assume (i) and prove (ii). It will suﬃce to show that for every simplicial set K, the induced

map

HomhSet∆(K, MapA(W, Z) ×MapA(W ′,Z×Y ) MapA(W ′, P )) → HomhSet∆(K, MapA(W ′, X))

is a bijection. Using Remark A.3.6.11, we can identify the left side with the set HomhSet∆(K, MapA(W, Z)) ≃
HomhA(W ⊗K, Z). Similarly, the right side can be identiﬁed with HomhA(W ′⊗K, X). In view of assumption
(i), it will suﬃce to show that the map βK : W ′ ⊗ K → Y × (W ⊗ K) exhibits W ′ ⊗ K as a homotopy
product of Y with W ⊗ K. The collection of simplicial sets K with this property clearly contains ∆0 and
is stable under weak homotopy equivalence. The assumption that multiplication by Y preserves homotopy
colimits guarantees that the hypotheses of Lemma A.3.6.9 are satisﬁed, so that the desired conclusion holds
for every simplicial set K.

Lemma A.3.6.12. Let A be a combinatorial model category and i : B0 → B an inclusion of partially ordered
sets. Suppose that there exists a retraction r : B → B0, such that r(b) ≤ b for each b ∈ B. Let F : B → A be
a diagram. Then a map α : X → lim(F ) in A exhibits X as a homotopy limit of F if and only if α exhibits
X as a homotopy limit of i∗F .

{
 
Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that F is injectively ﬁbrant. We have a canonical isomor-
phism lim(F ) ≃ lim(i∗F ). It will therefore suﬃce to show that the functor i∗ preserves injective ﬁbrations.
It now suﬃces to observe that i∗ is right adjoint to r∗, and that the functor r∗ preserves weak trivial
coﬁbrations.

Lemma A.3.6.13. Let A be a combinatorial model category, C a small category, F : C → A a diagram,
and α : X → lim(F ) a morphism in the category A. Suppose that:

(i) For each C ∈ C, the induced map X → F (C) is a weak equivalence in A.

(ii) The category C has a ﬁnal object C0.

Then α exhibits X as a homotopy limit of the diagram F .

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the diagram F is projectively ﬁbrant. Let F ′ :
C → A be deﬁned by the formula F ′(C) = F (C0). We observe that, for every G ∈ Fun(C, A), we have
HomFun(C,A)(G, F ′) = HomA(G(C0), F (C0)). In particular, we have a canonical map β : F → F ′. Condition
(i) guarantees that β is a weak equivalence. Since F (C0) ∈ A, is ﬁbrant, the diagram F ′ is injectively ﬁbrant.
It therefore suﬃces to show that the induced map X → lim(F ′) ≃ F (C0) is a weak equivalence, which follows
from (i).

Lemma A.3.6.14. Let A be a combinatorial model category, A a partially ordered set, and set B = {(a, b) ∈
Aop × A : a ≥ b}, regarded as a partially ordered subset of Aop × A. Let π : B → Aop denote the projection
onto the ﬁrst factor.

Suppose given diagrams F : B → A, G : A → A, and a natural transformation α : π∗(G) → F , which
induces weak equivalences G(a) → F (a, b) for each (a, b) ∈ B. Then α exhibits G as a homotopy right Kan
extension of F .

Proof. In view of Proposition A.2.8.9, it will suﬃce to show that for each a0 ∈ A, the transformation α
exhibits G(a0) as a homotopy limit of the diagram F |{(a, b) ∈ B : a ≤ a0}. Let B0 = {(a, b) ∈ B : a = a0}.
In view of Lemma A.3.6.12, it will suﬃce to show that α exhibits G(a0) as a limit of the diagram F0 = F |B0.
This follows immediately from Lemma A.3.6.13.

Proposition A.3.6.15. Let A be a combinatorial model category and A = A0 ∪ {∞} a partially ordered
set with a largest element ∞. Let B = {(a, b) ∈ Aop × A : a ≥ b}, regarded as a partially ordered subset of
Aop × A.

Suppose given an object X ∈ A together with functors Y : A → A, Z : Aop → A, P : B → A and

diagrams σa,b:

which depend functorially on (a, b) ∈ B. Suppose further that:

(i) Each diagram σa,b exhibits P (a, b) as a homotopy product of Z(a) and Y (b) in A.

(ii) The diagrams σa,a exhibit Z(a) as a weak exponential of X by Y (a).

(iii) Multiplication in A preserves homotopy colimits.

(iv) The diagram Y exhibits Y (∞) as a homotopy colimit of Y0 = Y |A0.

Then the diagram Z exhibits Z(∞) as the homotopy limit of the diagram Z0 = Z|Aop

Proof. Making ﬁbrant replacements if necessary, we may assume that each diagram σa,b is standard. Ac-

cording to the main result of [19], there exists a Quillen equivalence A′

F

G

/ A

where A′ is a combinatorial

simplicial model category. In view of Remark A.3.6.4, we may replace A by A′ and thereby reduce to the
case where A is a simplicial model category.

In view of Proposition A.3.3.12, it will suﬃce to prove the following: for every ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant object
C ∈ A, if we deﬁne G : Aop → Set∆ by the formula G(a) = MapA(C, Z(a)), then G exhibits G(∞) as a
homotopy limit of the diagram G|Aop
0 .

Let W : A → A be a coﬁbrant replacement for the functor a 7→ C × Y (a). Let G′ : Aop → Set∆ be

deﬁned by the formula G′(a) = MapA(W (a), X).

Deﬁne G′′ : B → Set∆ by the formula

G′′(a, b) = MapA(C, Z(a)) ×MapA(W (a),Z(a)×Y (b)) MapA(W (a), P (a, b)).

Let π : B → Aop denote projection onto the ﬁrst factor, so that we have natural transformations of diagrams

π∗G α← G′′ β

→ π∗G′.

We observe that β induces a trivial Kan ﬁbration G′′(a, b) → G′(a) for all (a, b) ∈ B. In particular, for a ≤ b
the induced map G′′(a, a) → G′′(a, b) is a homotopy equivalence. Condition (ii) guarantees that α induces
a homotopy equivalence G′′(a, b) → G(a) if a = b, and therefore for all (a, b) ∈ B.

Using Lemma A.3.6.14, we conclude that α and β exhibit G and G′ as homotopy right Kan extensions of
G′′ along π. In particular, G and G′ are equivalent in the homotopy category hFun(Aop, A). Assumptions
(iii) and (iv) guarantee that W exhibits W (∞) as the homotopy colimit of W |A0. Using Proposition
A.3.3.12, we deduce that G′ exhibits G′(∞) as the homotopy limit of G′|Aop
0 . It follows that G exhibits
G(∞) as the homotopy limit of G|Aop

0 , as desired.

We conclude this section with an application of Proposition A.3.6.15.

Proposition A.3.6.16. Let S be an excellent model category in which the monoidal structure is given by
the Cartesian product. Let A be a combinatorial S-enriched model category, A = A0 ∪ {∞} a partially
ordered set with a largest element ∞, and {Ca}a∈A a diagram of small S-enriched categories indexed by A.

(b) The diagram {Ca}a∈A exhibits C∞ as a homotopy colimit of the diagram {Ca}a∈A0.

U ⊆ A a chunk. Let Uf denote the full subcategory of U spanned by those objects which are ﬁbrant in A,
and let W denote the collection of weak equivalences in Uf . Then the induced map U◦ → Uf [W −1] is a weak
equivalence of S-enriched categories.

Proof. Let W0 = W ∩ U◦. Since every weak equivalence in U◦ is actually an equivalence, we conclude that
the induced map U◦ → U◦[W −1
It will therefore suﬃce to prove that the map
i : U◦[W −1
] → Uf [W −1] is a weak equivalence. Let F be a S-enriched ﬁbrant replacement functor which
carries U to itself, so that F induces a map j : Uf [W −1] to U◦[W −1

We will prove that h determines a homotopy from the identity to j ◦ i, so that j is a left homotopy inverse
to i. Applying the same argument to the restriction h| U◦ ⊗[1]S will show that j is a right homotopy inverse
to i.

To prove that h gives the desired homotopy, it will suﬃce to show that the inclusions {0}, {1} ֒→ [1]S

induce weak equivalences

Uf [W −1] → (Uf ⊗[1]S)[W ′−1].

This follows immediately from Corollary A.3.4.11 and Lemma A.3.5.14.

Proof. Without loss of generality we may suppose that each Ca is coﬁbrant. The proof of Proposition A.2.8.2
shows that there exists a (small) regular cardinal κ such that the collection of homotopy limit diagrams in
Fun(A, CatS) is stable under κ-ﬁltered colimits. This cardinal depends only on A and S, and remains
invariant if we enlarge the universe. Using Lemma A.3.4.15, we can write A as a κ-ﬁltered union of full
subcategories U ⊆ A, where U is a Ca-chunk for each a ∈ A. We now conclude by applying Proposition
A.3.6.16.

A.3.7 Localizations of Simplicial Model Categories

Let A and A′ be two model categories with the same underlying category. We say that A′ is a (Bousﬁeld)
localization of A if:

(C) A morphism f of C is a coﬁbration in A if and only if f is a coﬁbration in A′.

(W ) If a morphism f of C is a weak equivalence in A, then f is a weak equivalence in A′.

It then follows also that:

(F ) If a morphism f of C is a ﬁbration in A′, then f is a ﬁbration in A.

Our goal in this section is to study the localizations of a ﬁxed model category A, and to relate this to

our study of localizations of presentable ∞-categories (§5.5.4).

Let A be a simplicial model category. Let hA be the homotopy category of A, obtained from A by
inverting all weak equivalences. Alternatively, we can obtain A by ﬁrst passing to the full subcategory
A◦ ⊆ A spanned by the ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects, and then passing to the homotopy category of the simplicial
category A◦. From the second point of view, we see that hA has a natural enrichment over the homotopy
category H: if X, Y ∈ hA are represented by ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects X, Y ∈ A, then we let

MaphA(X, Y ) = [MapA(X, Y )].

Here [K] ∈ H denotes the object of H represented by a Kan complex K. In fact, this description is accurate
if we assume only that X is coﬁbrant and Y ﬁbrant.
Let S be a collection of morphisms in hA. Then:

(i) We will say that an object Z ∈ hA is S-local if, for every morphism f : X → Y in S, the induced map

MaphA(Y, Z) → MaphA(X, Z)

is a homotopy equivalence. We say that an object Z ∈ A is S-local if its image in hA is S-local.

(ii) We will say that a morphism f : X → Y of hA is an S-equivalence if, for every S-local object Z ∈ hA,

the induced map

MaphA(Y, Z) → MaphA(X, Z)
is a homotopy equivalence. We say that a morphism f in A is an S-equivalence if its image in hA is
an S-equivalence.

If S is a collection of morphisms in hA, with image S in hA, we will apply the same terminology: an
object of A (or hA) is said to be S-local if it is S-local, and morphism of A (or hA) will be said to be an
S-equivalence, if it is an S-equivalence.

Lemma A.3.7.1. Let A be a left proper simplicial model category, let S be a collection of morphisms in
hA, and let i : A → B be a coﬁbration in A. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The map i is an S-equivalence.

712

(2) For every ﬁbrant object X ∈ A which is S-local, the map MapA(B, X) → MapA(A, X) is a trivial Kan

ﬁbration.

Proof. Choose a trivial ﬁbration f : A′ → A, where A′ is coﬁbrant, and choose a factorization

of i ◦ f , where i′ is a coﬁbration and f ′ is a trivial ﬁbration. We have a commutative diagram

Since f is a weak equivalence and i′ is a coﬁbration, the left properness of A guarantees that g is a weak
equivalence. It follows from the two-out-of-three property that j is also a weak equivalence.

`

Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed. Let X be an S-local ﬁbrant object of A. The map p : MapA(B, X) →
MapA(A, X) is a Kan ﬁbration. We wish to show that p is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. Our assumption that
X is S-local guarantees that the map q′ : MapA(B′, X) → MapA(A′, X) is a homotopy equivalence, and
therefore a trivial ﬁbration (since i′ is a coﬁbration). The map

q : MapA(A

B′, X) → MapA(A)

aA′

is a pullback of q′, and therefore also a trivial ﬁbration. To show that p is a trivial Kan ﬁbration, it will suﬃce
to show that for every t : A → X, the ﬁber p−1{t} is a contractible Kan complex. Since the corresponding
ﬁber q−1{t} is contractible, it will suﬃce to show that composition with j induces a homotopy equivalence

p−1{t} → q−1{t}.

This is clear, since j is a weak equivalence between coﬁbrant objects of the simplicial model category AA/.
Now suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. We wish to show that i is an S-equivalence. For this, it suﬃces to

show that for every ﬁbrant S-local object X ∈ A, the map

q′ : MapA(B′, X) → MapA(A′, X)

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. The preceding argument shows that the ﬁber of q′ over a morphism t′ : A′ → X
is contractible, provided that t′ factors as a composition

A′ f

→ A t→ X.

To complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that the same result holds for an arbitrary vertex t′ of MapA(A′, X).
The map t′ factors as a composition

A′ u→ Y v→ X,

where u is a coﬁbration and v is a trivial ﬁbration. We have a commutative diagram

MapA(B′, Y )

MapA(A′, Y )

MapA(B′, X)

/ MapA(A′, X)

in which the vertical arrows are trivial Kan ﬁbrations.
MapA(B′, Y ) ×MapA(A′,Y ) {u} is a contractible. Choose a trivial coﬁbration A′

It will therefore suﬃce to show that the ﬁber

A Y is the pushout of a weak equivalence by a coﬁbration, and
therefore a weak equivalence (since A is left proper). It follows that the map Y → Z is a weak equivalence
between ﬁbrant objects of A. We have a commutative diagram

therefore suﬃce to show that the ﬁber of q′′ is contractible, when taken over the composite map t′′ : A′ u→
Y → Z. We now observe that t′′ factors through A, so that the desired result follows from the ﬁrst part of
the proof.

Corollary A.3.7.2. Let A and B be simplicial model categories, and suppose given a simplicial adjunction

Assume that B is left proper. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The adjunction between F and G is a Quillen adjunction.

A

F /
G

/ B.

(2) The functor F preserves coﬁbrations and the functor G preserves ﬁbrant objects.

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) is obvious. Conversely, suppose that (2) is satisﬁed. We wish to prove
that F is a left Quillen functor. Since F preserves coﬁbrations, it will suﬃce to show that for every trivial
coﬁbration u : A → A′ in A, the image F u is a weak equivalence in B. Applying Lemma A.3.7.1 in the case
S = ∅, it will suﬃce to prove the following: for every ﬁbrant object B ∈ B, the induced map

MapB(F A′, B) → MapB(F A, B)

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. Since F and G are adjoint simplicial functors, this is equivalent to the requirement
that the map MapA(A′, GB) → MapA(A, GB) be a trivial Kan ﬁbration, which follows from our assumption
that u is a trivial coﬁbration in A and that GB ∈ A is ﬁbrant.

Proposition A.3.7.3. Let A be a left proper combinatorial simplicial model category, and let S be a (small)
set of coﬁbrations in A. Let S−1A denote the same category, with the following distinguished classes of
morphisms:

(C) A morphism g in S−1A is a coﬁbration if it is a coﬁbration when regarded as a morphism in A.

(W ) A morphism g in S−1A is a weak equivalence if it is an S-equivalence.

Then:

(1) The above deﬁnitions endow S−1A with the structure of a combinatorial simplicial model category.

(2) The model category S−1A is left proper.

(3) An object X ∈ A is ﬁbrant in S−1A if and only if X is S-local and ﬁbrant in A.

Proof. Enlarging S if necessary, we may assume:

(a) For every morphism f : A → B in S and every n ≥ 0, the induced map

(A × ∆n)

(B × ∂ ∆n) → B × ∆n

belongs to S.

(b) The set S contains a collection of generating trivial coﬁbrations for A.

It follows that an object X ∈ A is ﬁbrant and S-local if and only if it has the extension property with
respect to every morphism in S. Since S ⊆ C ∩ W , we deduce that every ﬁbrant object of S−1A is S-local
and ﬁbrant in A. The converse follows from Lemma A.3.7.1; this proves (3).

To prove (1), it will suﬃce to show that the classes C and W satisfy the hypotheses of Proposition A.2.6.8
(the compatibility of the simplicial structure on S−1A with its model structure follows immediately from
Proposition A.3.1.7). We observe that Lemma A.3.7.1 implies that C ∩ W is a weakly saturated class of
morphisms in A. The only other nontrivial point is to show that W is an accessible subcategory of A[1].

Proposition A.1.2.5 implies the existence of a functor T : A → A, equipped with a natural transformation

idA → T , with the following properties:

(i) For every X ∈ A, the object T X ∈ A is ﬁbrant and S-local.

(ii) For every X ∈ A, the map X → T X belongs to the smallest weakly saturated class of morphisms

containing S; in particular, it belongs to W ∩ C and is therefore an S-equivalence.

(iii) There exists a regular cardinal κ such that T commutes with κ-ﬁltered colimits.

It follows that a morphism f : X → Y in A is an S-equivalence if and only if the induced map T f :
T X → T Y is an S-equivalence. Since T X and T Y are S-local, Yoneda’s lemma (in the category hA))
implies that T f is an S-equivalence if and only if T f is a weak equivalence in A. It follows that W is the
inverse image under T of the collection of weak equivalenes in A. Corollaries A.2.6.5 and A.2.6.6 imply that
W is an accessible subcategory of A[1], as desired. This completes the proof of (1).

We now prove (2). We need to show that the collection of S-equivalences in A is stable under pushouts

by coﬁbrations. We observe that every morphism f : X → Z admits a factorization

f ′
→ Y

f ′′
→ Z

X

where f ′ is a coﬁbration and f ′′ is a weak equivalence in A (in fact, we can choose f ′′ to be a trivial ﬁbration
in A). If f is an S-equivalence, then f ′ is an S-equivalence, so that f ′ ∈ C ∩ W . It will therefore suﬃce to
show that C ∩ W and the class of weak equivalences in A are stable under pushouts by coﬁbrations. The
ﬁrst follows from the assertion that C ∩ W is weakly saturated, and the second from the assumption that A
is left proper.

Proposition A.3.7.4. Let A be a left proper combinatorial simplicial model category. Then:

(1) Every combinatorial localization of A has the form S−1A, where S is some (small) set of coﬁbrations

in A.

(2) Given two (small) sets of coﬁbrations S and T , the localizations S−1A and T −1A coincide if and only

if the class of S-local objects of hA coincides with the class of T -local objects of hA.

Proof. The “if” direction of (2) is obvious, and the converse follows from the characterization of the ﬁbrant
objects of S−1A given in Proposition A.3.7.3. We now prove (1). Let B be a combinatorial model category
which is a localization of A, and let S be a set of generating trivial coﬁbrations for B. We claim that
B = S−1A. The coﬁbrations of S−1A and B coincide. Moreover, the collection of trivial coﬁbrations
in S−1A is a weakly saturated class of morphisms which contains S, and therefore contains every trivial
coﬁbration in B. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that every trivial coﬁbration f : X → Y in
S−1A is a trivial coﬁbration in B.

gf -local ﬁbrant object X ∈ A is also f -local.

Suppose that X is gf -local. We wish to prove that the map p : MapA(B, X) → MapA(A, X) is a
trivial Kan ﬁbration. Since p is automatically a Kan ﬁbration, it will suﬃce to show that the ﬁber p−1{t}

(2) There exists a combinatorial simplicial model category A and an equivalence C ≃ N(A◦).

Proof. According to Theorem 5.5.1.1 and Proposition 5.5.4.15, C is presentable if and only if there exists
a small simplicial set K, a small set S of morphisms in P(K), and an equivalence C ≃ S−1 P(K). Let
D be the simplicial category C[K]op, and let B be the category SetD
∆ of simplicial functors D → Set∆,
endowed with the injective model structure. Proposition 4.2.4.4 implies that there is an equivalence P(K) ≃
N(B◦). Moreover, Propositions A.3.7.3 and A.3.7.4 implies that there is a bijective correspondence between
accessible localizations of P(K) (as a presentable ∞-category) and combinatorial localizations of B (as a
model category). This proves the implication (1) ⇒ (2). Moreover, it also shows that (2) ⇒ (1) in the
special case where A is a localization of a category of simplicial presheaves.

We now complete the proof by invoking the following result, proven in [19]: for every combinatorial model
∆ , and a Quillen equivalence of
∆ . Moreover, the proof given in [19] shows that when A is a simplicial model category, then

category A, there exists a small category D, a set S of morphisms of SetDop
A with S−1 SetD
F and G can be chosen to be simplicial functors.

Remark A.3.7.7. Let A and B be combinatorial simplicial model categories. Then the underlying ∞-
categories N(A◦) and N(B◦) are equivalent if and only if A and B can be joined by a chain of simplicial
Quillen equivalences. The “only if” assertion follows from Corollary A.3.1.12, and the “if” direction can be
proven using the methods described in [19].

Proposition A.3.7.8. Let A be a left proper combinatorial simplicial model category, and let C = N(A◦)
denote its underlying ∞-category. Suppose that C0 ⊆ C is an accessible localization of C, and let L : C → C0
denote a left adjoint to the inclusion.

Then there exists a localization A′ of A satisfying the following conditions:

(1) An object X ∈ A′ is ﬁbrant if and only if it is ﬁbrant in A, and the associated object of the homotopy

category hA ≃ hC belongs to the full subcategory hC0 .

(2) A morphism f : X → Y in A′ is a weak equivalence if and only if the functor L : hC → hC0 carries f

to an isomorphism in the homotopy category hC0 .

Proof. According to Proposition A.3.7.6, the ∞-category C is presentable. The results of §5.5.4 imply that
we can write C0 = S−1 C, for some small collection of morphisms S in C. We then take
S be a collection of
representatives for the elements of S as coﬁbrations between coﬁbrant objects of A, and let A′ denote the
localization

S−1A.

e

We conclude this section by establishing a universal property enjoyed by the localization of a combinatorial

e
simplicial model category.

Proposition A.3.7.9. Suppose given a simplicial Quillen adjunction

A

F /
G

/B

between left proper combinatorial simplicial model categories, and let A′ be a Bousﬁeld localization of A.
The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The adjoint functors F and G determine a Quillen adjunction between A′ and B.

(2) Let α be a morphism in A which is a weak equivalence in A′. Then the left derived functor LF : hA →

hB carries α to an isomorphism in the homotopy category hB.

(3) For every ﬁbrant object X ∈ B, the image GX is a ﬁbrant object of A′.

Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) is obvious, and the implication (3) ⇒ (1) follows from Corollary A.3.7.2.
We will complete the proof by showing that (2) ⇒ (3). According to Proposition A.3.7.4 and Remark
A.3.7.5, we may suppose that A′ = S−1A, where S is a small collection of coﬁbrations between coﬁbrant
objects of A. Let X be a ﬁbrant object of B; we wish to show that GX is a ﬁbrant object of A′. Since
GX is ﬁbrant in A, it will suﬃce to show that GX is S-local (Proposition A.3.7.3). In other words, we
must show that if α : A → B belongs to S, then the induced map p : MapA(B, GX) → MapA(A, GX)
is a weak homotopy equivalence. Since F and G are simplicial functors, we can identify p with the map
MapB(F B, X) → MapB(F A, X). To prove that p is a weak homotopy equivalence, it will suﬃce to show
that F (α) is a weak equivalence between coﬁbrant objects of B. This follows immediately from assumption
(2) (because α is a coﬁbration between coﬁbrant objects of A, we can identify F (α) with the left derived
functor LF (α).

Corollary A.3.7.10. Let A and B be left proper combinatorial simplicial model categories, and suppose
given a simplicial Quillen adjunction

A

F /
G

/ B.

Then:

(1) There exists a new left proper combinatorial simplicial model structure A′ on the category A with the

following properties:

(C) A morphism α in A′ is a coﬁbration if and only if it is a coﬁbration in A.

717

o
(W ) A morphism α in A′ is a weak equivalence if and only if the left derived functor LF carries α to

an isomorphism in the homotopy category hB.

(F ) A morphism α in A′ is a ﬁbration if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to

every morphism in A′ satisfying (C) and (W ).

(2) The functors F and G determine a new simplicial Quillen adjunction

A′

F ′

G′

/B.

(3) Suppose that the right derived functor RG is fully faithful. Then the adjoint pair (F ′, G′) is a Quillen

equivalence.

Proof. The functors F and G determine a pair of adjoint functors

N A◦

f

g

/ N B◦

between the underlying ∞-categories (see Proposition 5.2.4.6), which are themselves presentable (Proposition
A.3.7.6). Let S be the collection of all morphisms u in N A◦ such that f (u) is an equivalence in N B◦.
Proposition 5.5.4.16 implies that S is generated (as a strongly saturated class of morphisms) by a small
subset S ⊆ S. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that the morphisms of S are represented by some
(small) collection T of coﬁbrations between coﬁbrant objects of A. Let A′ = T −1A. We claim that A′
satisﬁes the description given in (1). In other words, we claim that a morphism α in A is a T -equivalence
if and only if the left derived functor LF carries α to an isomorphism in hB. Without loss of generality,
we may suppose that α is a morphism between ﬁbrant-coﬁbrant objects of A, so that we can view α as a
morphism in the ∞-category N A◦. In this case, both conditions on α are equivalent to the requirement
that α belongs to S. This completes the proof of (1). Assertion (2) follows immediately from Proposition
A.3.7.9.

We now prove (3). Note that the homotopy category hA′ can be identiﬁed with a full subcategory of the
homotopy category hA, and that under this identiﬁcation the left derived functor LF restricts to the left
derived functor LF ′. It follows that for every ﬁbrant object X ∈ B, the counit map

(LF ′)(RG′)X ≃ (LF ′)(GX) ≃ (LF )(GX) ≃ (LF )(RG)X ≃ X

is an isomorphism in hB (where the last equivalence follows from our assumption that RG is fully faithful).
It follows that the functor RG′ is fully faithful. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that the left
derived functor LF ′ is conservative. In other words, we must show that if α : X → Y is a morphism in A′,
then α is a weak equivalence if and only if LF (α) is an isomorphism in B; this follows immediately from
(1).
