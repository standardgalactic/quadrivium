A succinct presentation of the quantized
Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, and a similar quantum
presentation of the classical Klein-Gordon
random ﬁeld

Abstract

A succinct presentation of the algebraic structure of the quantized Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld can be given in terms of a Lorentz invariant inner product. A presentation
of a classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld at non-zero temperature can be given in
the same noncommutative algebraic style, allowing a detailed comparison of the
quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld with a classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld.

Key words: quantum ﬁeld theory, measurement, classical random ﬁelds

Introduction

In light of the Wightman reconstruction theorem[1], a presentation of a rela-
tivistic quantum ﬁeld theory just has to ﬁx all the expectation values of the
vacuum state. The most direct presentation in such terms would be to ﬁx the
expectation values of the vacuum state directly, but most presentations are
quite remote from the expectation values. We will discuss in section 2, there-
fore, an intermediate and very succinct algebraic presentation of the quantized
Klein-Gordon ﬁeld.

Then in section 3, we construct a closely similar noncommutative algebraic
presentation of a quantum ﬁeld that has the same probability density over
its conﬁguration space as a classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld at non-zero

temperature. In these algebraic presentations, a quantum ﬁeld theory is very
much closer to a classical random ﬁeld theory than quantum mechanics is to a
classical particle mechanics, which allows an understanding of quantum theory
in terms of classical random ﬁelds.

In the view taken here, a classical description can be understood to be what
we would observe if our measurement apparatus were not aﬀected at all by
quantum ﬂuctuations, whereas a quantum description can be understood to
be what we would observe if our measurement apparatus were aﬀected by
quantum ﬂuctuations to the same extent as the rest of the universe (as in fact it
is). Finally, therefore, a heterodox quantum description is introduced in section
4 in which our measurement apparatus is less aﬀected by quantum ﬂuctuations
than the rest of the universe. The principal technical characteristic of this
interaction-free quantum ﬁeld theory is that its Lorentz invariant quantum
vacuum state is not annihilated by the annihilation operators of the theory,
but is a Lorentz invariant analogue of a thermal state.

2 A succinct presentation of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld

Suppose that ˆφ : f 7→ ˆφ[f ] is a linear operator valued map from a suitable
space of functions. Typically f is taken from a Schwartz space of functions[2],
so that f (x) is inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable and decreases as well as its deriva-
tives faster than any power as x moves to inﬁnity in any direction. ˆφ(x) is
referred to as the operator valued distribution that generates ˆφ[f ],

ˆφ[f ] =

d4xf (x) ˆφ(x).

Z

Project ˆφ[f ] into two parts,

ˆφ[f ] = ˆa†[f ] + ˆa[f ],

(1)

(2)

and specify the algebraic properties of ˆa† and ˆa by the commutation relations

ˆa[g], ˆa†[f ]
h

ˆa[f ], ˆa[g]
h

ˆa†[f ], ˆa†[g]

The manifestly invariant Hermitian inner product (f, g) is given by

This ﬁxes the algebraic structure of the operators ˆφ[f ]. All that remains to
ﬁx the vacuum expectation values is to give the trivial action of the operators
ˆa[f ] on the vacuum state,

ˆa[f ] |0i = 0,

h0| ˆa†[f ] = 0,

(5)

and specify the normalization of the vacuum vector h0 |0i = 1.

That’s it. To calculate any vacuum expectation value, apply the commutation
relations above repeatedly, eliminating any terms in which ˆa[f ] |0i or h0| ˆa†[f ]
appear, until we obtain a number. This Lorentz invariant presentation can
be thought of as a relatively direct generating scheme for experimentally ob-
servable correlation functions. It is equivalent to Lagrangian and other pre-
sentations of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld. After the event, the algebraic
structure allows an interpretation of ˆa†[f ] and ˆa[f ] as creation and annihilation
operators.

3 The classical Klein-Gordon ﬁeld at non-zero temperature

There is no need to justify this quantum ﬁeld as the quantization of the
classical Klein-Gordon ﬁeld; indeed, to do so is counterproductive, because
the properties of the quantized and classical Klein-Gordon ﬁelds are quite
diﬀerent. It is more helpful to compare the properties of the quantized Klein-
Gordon ﬁeld with the properties of the classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld
at non-zero temperature. The emphasis on classical random ﬁelds at non-
zero temperature is necessary to make a relatively direct comparison with the
quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, because a diﬀerentiable classical ﬁeld cannot
describe quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations. A classical random ﬁeld has a
structure very similar to a quantum ﬁeld: following the approach above, a
classical random ﬁeld is a random variable valued map from a suitable space
of functions, X : f 7→ X[f ], and we can introduce a random variable valued
distribution X(x) that generates X[f ],

X[f ] =

d4xf (x)X(x).

Z

(6)

Just as a quantum ﬁeld state generates expectation values for quantum ob-
servables, so a classical random ﬁeld state generates expectation values for
classical random variables.

For the equilibrium state of the classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld at tem-
perature T , the probability of observing a conﬁguration φt(x) at time t is given
by

There is notably little diﬀerence between these probability densities, but it
is of course signiﬁcant: kBT is replaced by ¯h; the Galilean symmetry group
is replaced by the Poincar´e symmetry group; 1
2(|k|2 + m2) is replaced by
|k|2 + m2. These changes can all be thought of as aspects of the group the-

oretical diﬀerence.

From the point of view of these probability densities alone, disregarding for
the moment that measurement theory is diﬀerent for classical random ﬁelds
and for quantum ﬁelds, kBT and ¯h both determine the amplitude of ﬂuctu-
ations. The diﬀerent functional forms for thermal ﬂuctuations and quantum
ﬂuctuations are combined in a thermal state of the quantized Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld in the probability density

of observing a conﬁguration φt(x) at time t, in which the integrand interpolates
between the ρE integrand at low wave numbers (if m ≪ kBT /¯h) and the ρ0
integrand at high wave numbers (an analogue of this probability density is
derived in [3] as a “trajectory Wigner function”, but this paper deliberately
uses the more accessible idea of probability densities because they are adequate
for the argument made here). Thermal ﬂuctuations and quantum ﬂuctuations
are diﬀerent, as they have to be if we are to think about quantum ﬁeld theory
in terms of ﬂuctuations.

The probability density aspect of the classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld at
non-zero temperature can be presented in a quantum ﬁeld theoretical way,
just by replacing equation (4) by

so that the equilibrium state is the |0i state of the resulting quantum theory.
Nonequilibrium states can be generated from the equilibrium state in the usual
quantum ﬁeld theoretic way, by the action of a†[f ] on the |0i state. Equation
(10) does lead to the probability density ρE[φt], but the term θ(k0) explicitly
restricts wave-numbers to positive frequency, which is classically somewhat
heterodox. The explicit arrow-of-time term could be left out, but that would
be quantum theoretically somewhat heterodox, since it corresponds to there
being no lower bound for the energy.

Equally, the probability density aspect of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld can
be presented in a classical random ﬁeld theoretical way, just by introducing a
Hamiltonian

(11)

At the simple level of probability densities over conﬁguration space, where
they can be compared directly, we have been able to characterize the dif-
ference between the classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld and the quantized
Klein-Gordon ﬁeld very clearly, but this interchange of presentations of the
probability density aspect ignores a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the concepts
of measurement in classical and quantum theory. As a presentation of the clas-
sical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld, equation (10) introduces incompatibility of
measurements, while, as a presentation of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, a
probability density exp [−HQ[φt]/¯h] based on equation (11) implicitly asserts
that all measurements are compatible.

A commutative classical algebra of observables is of course not isomorphic
to a noncommutative quantum algebra of observables, so states over the two
algebras cannot in general be equivalent, but, just because the Wigner function
for the vacuum state of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld is positive deﬁnite,
we can ﬁx a classical state for a classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld to be
that Wigner function.

4 An intermediate measurement algebra

In physical terms, equation (10), as part of a quantum theoretical system,
makes all measurement devices subject to thermal ﬂuctuations at a universal
temperature T , as well as the measured system, while equation (11), as part
of a classical theoretical system, makes measurement devices not subject to
the empirical universality of quantum ﬂuctuations. Measurement devices are
subject to quantum ﬂuctuations, unless in the future we ﬁnd a way to reduce
them, but we can nonetheless imagine what we would observe if we could

5

eliminate quantum ﬂuctuations. Even if we decide that we cannot imagine so
much, nonetheless we can model the quantum ﬂuctuations of our real measure-
ment devices explicitly, just as we usually model the thermal ﬂuctuations of
our real measurement devices explicitly (if we have to, but we ignore thermal
ﬂuctuations whenever they make no observable diﬀerence).

This analysis suggests that we can introduce a variant of quantum ﬁeld theory
in which measurement devices are “quantum-cooled”, but quantum ﬂuctua-
tions of the measurement devices are not as entirely eliminated as they are
in classical measurement devices. The Hermitian inner product (f, g) of equa-
tion (4) essentially encodes the amplitude of the quantum ﬂuctuations of both
the measurement devices and of the rest of the universe. To separately de-
scribe the ﬂuctuations of the measurement devices and the ﬂuctuations of the
rest of the universe, we can construct a quantum ﬁeld theory in which the
commutation relations are taken essentially to describe interactions between
measurement devices, and the quantum ﬂuctuations of the rest of the universe
have an independent scale. Suppose, therefore, that equation (4) is replaced
by

(f, g)ξ = ξ¯h

Z

d4k
(2π)4 2πδ(kµkµ − m2)θ(k0) ˜f ∗(k)˜g(k).

(12)

where ξ > 0 is a real number, which will be less than 1 if we have successfully
quantum-cooled our measurement devices. For the state annihilated by a[f ],
the probability of observing a conﬁguration φt(x) becomes

(13)

so this is not the conventional vacuum state, with probability density ρ0[φt],
but a diﬀerent one, which is, nonetheless, Lorentz invariant. To construct
the conventional vacuum state, we modify the procedure used to construct a
thermal state, which invokes a Hamiltonian operator

ˆH =

so that, provided

λ =

2 tanh −1(ξ)

,

(17)

we again obtain ρ0[φt]. This equation has solutions for 0 < ξ < 1. This conven-
tional vacuum state, with an unconventional measurement algebra, is essen-
tially intermediate between a conventional quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld and
a classical Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld, in that the measurement algebra be-
comes closer to the classical algebra of observables as ξ → 0 (speaking loosely,
since the limit does not exist), while the observed state is unchanged, in the
sense that ρξ

λ[φt] is unchanged (at every time, and for every foliation).

Although this construction is instructive, it is more helpful to take either con-
ventional quantum ﬁeld theory or classical random ﬁeld theory as a conceptual
starting point for models of experimental apparatus. For the above model to
be useful, the detailed quantum ﬂuctuations of diﬀerent measurement appa-
ratuses would have to be describable by the same value of ξ < 1, which is
unlikely to be the case. Our measurement devices either will continue to be
subject to universal quantum ﬂuctuations, so that a quantum ﬁeld model will
be appropriate, or else the detailed quantum ﬂuctuations of each measurement
apparatus, subject to diﬀerent levels of quantum ﬂuctuations, may be more
easily described explicitly in a classical random ﬁeld model.

5 Discussion

Remarkably from some points of view, the classical presentation of the prob-
ability density aspect of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld by equation (11)
is manifestly nonlocal[4], explicitly exhibiting the nonlocality omnipresent in
quantum mechanics that has been identiﬁed by Hegerfeldt[5], even though
signal locality is preserved. It is noteworthy that Hegerfeldt nonlocality is
quite diﬀerent from the nonlocality usually inferred from the experimental
violation of Bell inequalities. Bell inequalities cannot be derived for classical
random ﬁelds unless assumptions are introduced that are generally not sat-
isﬁed if there are either thermal or quantum ﬂuctuations[6]. From a classical
analytical perspective, Hegerfeldt nonlocality can be understood as dynami-

7

 
cal, whereas the violation of Bell inequalities can be understood to be a result
of an experimenter making a special choice of initial conditions.

Bohr and Heisenberg abandoned a disturbance interpretation as an immediate
and direct result of the EPR paper in 1935, preferring an essentially positivis-
tic interpretation[7]. To my knowledge disturbance interpretations have not
been directly suggested since because of an apparently unreasonable nonlo-
cality, although the idea of measurement disturbance has never entirely gone
away and can be found in modiﬁed form, for example, in the unsharp prop-
erties approach to Positive Operator Valued Measures[8]. The approach of
this paper, however, taken with Refs. [3] and [6], allows a return to a distur-
bance interpretation of quantum theory, provided it is in terms of classical
random ﬁeld models for complete experimental apparatuses, not in terms of
measurement of classical particle properties. The possibility of interchanging
classical and quantum presentations of quantum ﬁelds and classical random
ﬁelds, and the construction of quantum ﬁeld theories that are in a reasonable
sense intermediate between them, oﬀers new ways of thinking about both.

I am grateful for conversations with Piero Mana in Stockholm, whose idea it
was to write down equation (10), and to a referee for helpful comments.
