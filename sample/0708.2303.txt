Abstract. We argue for a compositional semantics grounded in a strongly typed 
ontology that reflects our commonsense view of the world and the way we talk 
about  it  in  ordinary  language.  Assuming  the  existence  of  such a  structure,  we 
show  that  the  semantics  of  various  natural  language  phenomena  may  become 
nearly trivial.  

Keywords: Semantics, ontology, commonsense knowledge. 

1   Introduction 

If the main business of semantics is to explain how linguistic constructs relate to the 
world,  then  semantic  analysis  of  natural  language  text  is,  indirectly,  an  attempt  at 
uncovering  the  semiotic  ontology  of  commonsense  knowledge,  and  particularly  the 
background  knowledge  that  seems  to  be  implicit  in  all  that  we  say  in  our  everyday 
discourse.  While  this  intimate  relationship  between  language  and  the  world  is 
generally accepted, semantics (in all its paradigms) has traditionally proceeded in one 
direction: by first stipulating an assumed set of ontological commitments followed by 
some  machinery  that  is  supposed  to,  somehow,  model  meanings  in  terms  of  that 
stipulated structure of reality. 

With  the  gross  mismatch  between  the  trivial  ontological  commitments  of  our 
semantic  formalisms  and  the  reality  of  the  world  these  formalisms  purport  to 
represent,  it  is  not  surprising  therefore  that  challenges  in  the  semantics  of  natural 
language are rampant. However, as correctly observed in [7], semantics could become 
nearly trivial if it was grounded in an ontological structure that is, “isomorphic to the 
way we talk about the world”. The obvious question however is ‘how does one arrive 
at  this  ontological  structure  that  implicitly  underlies  all  that  we  say  in  everyday 
discourse?’  One  plausible  answer  is  the  (seemingly  circular)  suggestion  that  the 
semantic analysis of natural language should itself be used to uncover this structure. 
In this regard we strongly agree with [4] who states: 

We must not try to resolve the metaphysical questions first, and then construct 
a  meaning-theory  in  light  of  the  answers.  We  should  investigate  how  our 
language actually  functions, and how  we  can construct a workable systematic 
description  of  how  it  functions;  the  answers  to  those  questions  will  then 
determine the answers to the metaphysical ones.

What this suggests, and correctly so, in our opinion, is that in our effort to understand 
the  complex  and  intimate  relationship  between  ordinary  language  and  everyday 
commonsense knowledge, one could, as also suggested in [2], “use language as a tool 
for uncovering the semiotic ontology of commonsense” since ordinary language is the 
best known theory we have of everyday knowledge. 

To avoid this seeming circularity (in wanting this ontological structure that would 
trivialize semantics; while at the same time suggesting that semantic analysis should 
itself  be  used  as  a  guide  to  uncovering  this  ontological  structure),  we  could  start 
performing  semantic  analysis  from  the  ground  up,  assuming  a  minimal  (almost  a 
trivial and basic) ontology, building up the ontology as we go guided by the results of 
the  semantic  analysis.  The  advantages  of  this  approach  are:  (i)  the  ontology  thus 
constructed as a result  of this process  would  not  be  invented, as  is the  case in  most 
approaches to ontology (e.g., [5], [8] and [13]), but would instead be discovered from 
what is in fact implicitly assumed in  our use of language in everyday discourse; (ii) 
the  semantics  of  several  natural  language  phenomena  should  as  a  result  become 
trivial, since the semantic analysis was itself the source of the underlying knowledge 
structures (in a sense, the semantics would have been done before we even started!) 

In this paper we suggest exactly such an approach. In particular, in the rest of the 
paper  we  (i)  argue  that  semantics  must  be  grounded  in  a  much  richer  ontological 
structure, one that reflects our commonsense  view of the  world and the way we talk 
about it in ordinary language; (ii) it will be demonstrated that in a logic ‘embedded’ 
with commonsense metaphysics the semantics of various natural language phenomena 
could  become  ‘nearly’  trivial;  and  (iii)  we  finally  suggest  some  steps  towards 
discovering  (as  opposed  to  inventing)  the  ontological  structure  that  seems  to 
implicitly underlie all that we say in ordinary language. 

2   Semantics with Ontological Content

entity . We shall use  x(

We  begin  by  making  a  case  for  a  semantics  that  is  grounded  in  a  strongly  typed 
ontological structure that is isomorphic to our commonsense view of reality. In doing 
so,  our  ontological  commitments  will  initially  be  minimal.  In  particular,  we  assume 
the  existence  of  a  subsumption  hierarchy  of  a  number  of  general  categories  such  as 
animal, substance, entity, artifact, event, etc., and where the fact that 
an  object  of  type  human  is  also  an  entity,  for  example,  is  expressed  as 
animal  to state that x is an object of type 
human
human  to state that the property Articulate is true of 
animal, and  Articulate x(
some object x, an object that  must be of type human (since ‘articulate’ is a property 
  when  the  property  P  is 
x
that  is  ordinarily  said  of  humans).  We  write 
∃
true of some object x of type t; 
 when P is true of a unique object of 
P x
( ))
type t; and 
 when the property P is true of some object x of type t, an 
x

conceptually exist. Proper nouns, such as Sheba, are interpreted as

write (1) as 
(
in  a  single  scope,  be  associated  with  more  than  one  type.  For  example,  x  in  (1)  is 
considered to be an entity and an object of type t, where t is presumably the type 
of objects that the property P applies to (or makes sense of). In these situations a type 
unification must occur. In particular, type unification occurs when some variable x is 
)•s t , 
associated  with  more  than  one  type  in  a  single  scope.  A  type  unification  (
between two types s and t, where Q is one of the standard quantifiers  ∀  and  ∃  is 
defined as follows:

As  an  initial  example,  consider  the  steps  involved  in  the  interpretation  of  ‘sheba  is 
hungry’,  where  it  will  be  assumed  that  (
  and  that  Hungry  is  a 
property that applies to (or makes sense of) objects that are of type animal: 
sheba is hungry

Thus, ‘sheba is hungry’ states that there is a unique object named sheba, which must 
be an object of type animal, and such that sheba is hungry. Type unification will not 
always  be  as  straightforward,  as  in  general  there  could  be  more  than  two  types 
associated with a variable in a single scope. Consider for example the interpretation of 
‘sheba is a young artist’, where Young is assumed to be a property that applies to  (or 
makes sense of) physical objects; and where it is assumed that Artist is a property 
that is ordinarily said of objects that are of type human:

⇒ ∃
(

1sheba

::

entity

)(

Artist sheba
(

::

human
)

∧

Young sheba
(

::

physical  
))

A  pair  of  type  unifications,  must  now  occur:  (
resulting in human. The final interpretation is thus given as follows: 

•

(

entity human physical , 

))

•

sheba is a young artist

⇒ ∃
(

1sheba

::

human

)(

Artist sheba
)
(

∧

Young sheba
(

))

(5) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
In the final analysis, therefore, ‘sheba is a young artist’ is interpreted as follows: there 
is a unique object named sheba, an object that must be of type human, and such that 
sheba is Artist and Young. It should be noted here that not recognizing the ontological 
difference  between  human  and  Artist  (namely,  that  what  ontologically  exist  are 
objects of type human, and not artists, and that Artist is a mere property that may or 
may not apply to objects of type human) has traditionally led to ontologies rampant 
with multiple inheritance. Note, further, that in contrast with human, which is a first-
intension ontological concept (see [3] for a formal discussion on this issue), Artist and 
Young are considered to be second-intension logical concepts, namely properties that 
may or may not be true of first-intension (ontological) concepts. Moreover, and unlike 
first-intension ontological concepts (such as human), logical concepts such as Artist 
are  assumed 
logical  expressions,  such  as

temporal,  cultural-dependent,  etc.),  the  fact  that  some  x  is  human  (and  thus  an 
animal, etc.) is not1.

3   More on Type Unification 

Thus  far  we  performed  simple  type  unifications  involving  types  that  are  in  a 
human , 
subsumption  relationship.  For  example,  we  assumed  (
entity
since  (
.  Quite  often,  however,  it  is  not  subsumption  but  some 
)
other  relationship  that  exists  between  the  different  types  associated  with  a  variable, 
and a typical example is the case of nominal compounds. Consider the following: 

human entity
)
•

human

(cid:1)

=

a.  book review 
b.  book proposal  
c.  design review   
d.  design plan 

(6) 

From  the  standpoint  of  commonsense,  the  reference  to  a  book  review  should 
imply the existence of a book, whereas the reference to a book proposal should 
be considered to be a reference to a proposal of some book, a book that might not 
(yet) actually exist. That is, 

1  In a recent argument Against Fantology [12] it was noted that too much attention has been paid to the 
false  doctrine  that  much  can  be  discovered  about the  ontological  structure  of  reality  by  predication  in 
first-order logic. In particular, it is argued in [12] that the use of standard predication in first-order logic 
in representing the meanings of ‘John is a human’ and ‘John is tall’, for example, completely ignores the 
different  ontological  categories  implicit  in  each  utterance.  While  we  agree  with  this  observation,  we 
believe that our approach to a semantics grounded in an a rich ontological structure that is supposed to 
reflect  our  commonsense  reality,  does  solve  this  problem  without  introducing  ad-hoc  relations  to  the 
formalism,  as  example  (4)  and  subsequent  examples  in  this  paper  demonstrate.  First-order  logic  (and 
Frege,  for  that matter), are  therefore not necessarily  the villains,  and  the “predicates  do not  represent” 
slogan is perhaps appropriate, but it seems only when predicates are devoid of any ontological content.

Finally, it must be noted that, in general, type unification might fail, and this occurs in 
the absence of any relationship between the types assigned to a variable in the same 
naturalObj ,  i.e.,  that  Artificial  is  a 
scope.  For  example,  assuming Artificial x(
::
property  ordinarily  said  of  objects  of 
type  naturalObj,  and  assuming 
car

It would seem therefore that type unification fails in the interpretation of some phrase 
that does not seem to be plausible from the standpoint of commonsense2. 

4   From Abstract to Actual Existence 

What we have been doing thus far can be summarized as follows: we have embedded 
commonsense  into  our  semantics by  annotating  every  quantified  variable referred  to 
in  some  predicate  P  with  an  ontological  category  that  P  applies  to  (or  makes  sense 
of),  as  per  our  everyday  use  of  ordinary  language.  In  this  section  it  will  be 
demonstrated  how  this  mechanism,  along  with  the  notion  of  type  unification,  can 
explain how certain abstract entities that initially can only be assumed to conceptually 
exist, are, in an appropriate context, reduced to concrete spatio-temporal entities.  

)

::

Recall  that  our  intention  in  associating  types  with  quantified  variables,  as,  for 
human , was  to reflect  our commonsense  understanding 
example, in  Articulate x(
of  how  the  property  Articulate  is  used  in  our  everyday  discourse,  namely  that 
Articulate is ordinarily said of objects that are of type human. What of a property such 
as Imminent, then? Undoubtedly, saying some object e is Imminent only makes sense 
in  ordinary  language  when  e  is  some  event,  which  we  have  been  expressing  as 
event .  But  there  is  obviously  more  that  we  can  assume  of  e.  In 
Imminent e( ::
particular, imminent is said in ordinary language of some e when e is an event that has 

)

2    Interestingly,  type  unification  and  the  embedding  of  ontological  types  into  our  semantics  seems  also 
promising in providing an explanation for the notion of metonymy in natural language. While we cannot 
get  into  this  issue  here  in  much  details,  we  will  simply  consider  the  following  example  by  way  of 
illustration, where R is some salient relationship between a human and a hamSandwich: 
the ham sandwich ordered a beer

  That  is, saying  ‘the ham sandwich ordered  a beer’  essentially  means  (again,  as  far as commonsense is 
concerned) that some human, who stands in some relationship to a hamSandwich, ordered a beer.

not  yet  occurred,  that  is,  an  event  that  exists  only  conceptually,  which  we  write  as 
event .  A  question  that  arises  now  is  this:  what  is  the  status  of  an 
Imminent e( ::
event e that, at the same time, is imminent as well as important? Clearly, an important 
and imminent event should still be assumed to be an event that does not actually exist 
(as important as it may be). ‘Important’ must therefore be a property that is said of an 
event that also need not actually exist, as illustrated by the following:

It  is  important  to  note  here  that  one  can  always  ‘bring  down’  an  object  (such  as  an 
event)  from  abstract  existence  into  actual  existence,  but  the  reverse  is  not  true. 
Consequently,  quantification  over  variables  associated  with  the  type  of  an  abstract 
concept,  such  as  event,  should  always  initially  assume  abstract  existence.  To 
illustrate, let us first assume the following: 

Attend x

(

::

human
,

y

::

Cancel x

(

::

human
,

y

::

event  
)
a

event  
)

(11) 
(12) 

That  is,  we  have  assumed  that  it  always  makes  sense  to  speak  of  a  human  that 
attended  or  cancelled  some  event,  where  to  attend  an  event  is  to  have  an  existing 
event; and where the object of a cancellation is an event that does not (anymore, if it 
ever did) exist3. Consider now the following: 

john attended the seminar

That is, saying ‘john attended the seminar’ is saying there is a specific human named 
j,  a  specific  seminar  e  (that  actually  exists)  such  that  j  attended  e.  On  the  other 
hand, consider now the interpretation of the sentence in (14).

3    Tense  and  modal  aspects  can also effect  the  initial  type  assignments,  although  a  full  treatment  of  this 

issue would involve discussing the interaction with syntax in much more detail. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
What  (14)  states  is  that  there  is  a  specific  human  named  john,  and  a  specific 
seminar  (that  does  not  necessarily  exist),  a  seminar  that  john  cancelled4.  An 
interesting  case  now  occurs  when  a  type  is  ‘brought  down’  from  abstract  existence 
event ;  that  is,  that  it 
into  actual  existence.  Let  us  assume 
Plan x
(
always makes sense to say that some human is planning (or did plan) an event that 
need not (yet) actually exist. Consider now the following,

(15) 

That is, saying ‘john planned the trip’ is simply saying that a specific object that must 
be  a  human  has  planned  a  specific  trip,  a  trip  that  might  not  have  actually 
happened5. However, assuming  Lengthy e( ::
event ; i.e., that Lengthy is a property 
that is ordinarily said of an (existing) event, then the interpretation of ‘john planned 
the lengthy trip’ should proceed as follows:

That is, there is a specific human (named john) that has planned a specific trip, a 
trip  that  was  Lengthy.  It  should  be  noted  here  that  the  trip  in  (16)  was  finally 
considered  to  be  an  existing  event  due  to  other  information  contained  in  the  same 
sentence. In general, however, this information can be contained in a larger discourse. 
For example, in interpreting ‘John planned the trip. It was lengthy’ the resolution of 
‘it’  would  force  a  retraction  of  the  types  inferred  in  processing  ‘John  planned  the 
trip’, as the information that follows will ‘bring down’ the aforementioned trip from 
abstract to actual existence. This subject is clearly beyond the scope of this paper, but 
readers interested in the computational details of such processes are referred to [14].

is  to  ‘the  idea  of  a  seminar’  does  not  solve  the  problem  since  it  is  not  the  idea  of  a  seminar  that  was 
cancelled, but an actual event that did not actually happen!   

5  Note that it is the trip (event) that did not necessarily happen, not the planning (activity) for it.

Note  that 
‘john sought a unicorn’ should not entail the existence of a unicorn. In addressing this 
problem, [9] suggested a solution that in effect treats ‘seek’ as an intensional verb that 
has  more  or  less  the  meaning  of  `tries  to  find',  using  the  tools  of  a  higher-order 
intensional  logic.  In  addition  to  unnecessary  complication  of  the  logical  form, 
however,  we  believe  that  this  is,  at  best,  a  partial  solution  since  the  problem  in  our 
opinion is  not  necessarily  in the verb seek, nor in the reference to unicorns. That is, 
painting,  imagining,  etc.  of  a  unicorn  (or  an  elephant,  for  that  matter)  should  not 
entail  the  existence  of  a  unicorn  (nor  the  existence  of  an  elephant).  To  illustrate 
further, let us first assume the following: 

human
Paint x
::
,
(
human
y
Find x
,
::

(

painting  
y
::
)
entity  
::
)

(20) 
(21) 

That is, we are assuming that it always makes sense to speak of a human that painted 
some painting, and of some human that found some entity. Consider now the 
interpretation in (22), where it was assumed that Large is a property that applies to (or 
makes sense of) objects that are of type physical.

∧

( ))

In the final analysis, therefore, if ‘john found a large elephant’ then there is a specific 
human  (named  j),  and  some  elephant  e,  such  that  e  is  Large  and  j  found  e. 
However, consider now the interpretation in (23). 

john painted a large elephant

Note  that  what  we  now  have  is  a  quantified  variable,  e,  that  is  supposed  to  be  an 
object  of  type  elephant,  an  object  that  is  described  by  a  property,  where  it  is 
considered to  be an  object  of type  physical,  and an  object that is in  a  relation  in 
which  it  is  considered  to  be  a  painting.  There  are  two  pairs  of  type  unifications 
elephant physical , 
that must now occur, namely  (
•
where, if we recall the type unification definition given in (2), the former would result 
in making the reference to e abstract and in the introduction of a new variable of type 
painting. This process would in the final analysis result in the following: 

elephant painting  and  (

( ))

Note  here  that  the  interpretation  correctly  states  that  it  is  a  (painted)  elephant  (that 
need not actually exist) that is Large and not the painting itself. Thus, ‘john painted a 
large elephant’ is correctly interpreted as roughly meaning ‘john made a painting of a 
large elephant’. 

In addition to handling the so-called intensional verbs, our approach seems to also 
appropriately  handle  other  situations  that,  on  the  surface,  seem  to  be  addressing  a 
different issue. For example, consider the following: 

john read the book and then he burned it. 

(25) 

In Asher and Pustejovsky (2005) it is argued that ‘book’ in this context must have 
what is called a dot type, which is a complex structure that in a sense carries within it 
the semantic types associated with various senses of ‘book’. For instance, it is argued 
that ‘book’ in (25) carries the `informational content' sense (when it is being read) as 
well as the `physical  object' sense (when it is being burned). Elaborate machinery is 
then  introduced  to  ‘pick  out’  the  right  sense  in  the  right  context,  and  all  in  a  well-
typed compositional logic. 

But this approach presupposes that one can enumerate, a priori, all possible uses of 
the  word  `book'  in  ordinary  language6.  Moreover,  this  approach  does  not  seem  to 
provide a solution for the problem posed by example (24), since there does not seem 
to  be  an  obvious  reason  why  a  complex  dot  type  for  ‘elephant’  should  contain  a 
representational  sense,  although  it  is  an  object  that  can  be  painted.  To  see  how  this 
problem is dealt with in our approach, consider the following: 

Read x
(
Burn x
(

::
::

human
,
human
,

y
y

::
::

content  
)
physical  
)

(26) 
(27) 

That is, we are assuming  here that it always  makes sense  to speak  of a human that 
read some content, and of a human that burned some physical object. Consider 
now the following: 

john read a book  

(28) 

⇒ ∃
(

human

)(

b
∃

::

book

)(

c
∃

::

)(

ContentOf b c
( , )

∧

Read j b

( , ))

Thus, if ‘john read a book’ then there is some specific human (named j), some object 
b  of  type  book,  such  that  that  j  read  the  content  of  b.  On  the  other  hand,  consider 
now the following: 

6  Similar presuppositions are also made in a hybrid (connectionist/symbolic) ‘sense modulation’ approach 

described by Rais-Ghasem and Corriveau (1998).

∃

( , ))

That is, if ‘john burned a book’ then there is some specific human (named j), some 
object b of type book, such that that j burned b. Note, therefore, that when the book 
is being burned we are simply referring to the book as the physical object that it is, 
while  reading  the  book  implies,  implicitly,  that  we  are  referring  to  an  additional 
(abstract) object, namely the content of the book. The important point we wish to 
make here is that there is one book object, an object that is (ultimately) a physical 
object,  that  one  can  read  (its  content),  sell/trade/etc  (as  a  commodity),  etc.,  or 
burn (as is, i.e., as simply the physical object that it is!) Thus ‘book’ can be easily 
used in different ways in the same linguistic context, as illustrated by the following: 

john read a book and then he burned it

Like  the  example  of  ‘painting  a  large  elephant’  discussed  in  (24)  above,  where  the 
painting of an elephant implied its existence in some painting and it being large as 
some physical object (that need not actually exist), in (30) we also have a reference to 
a  book  as  a  physical  object  (that  has  been  burned),  and  to  a  book  that  has 
content (that has been read). Similar to the process depicted in figure 1 above, the 
type unifications in (30) should now result in the following: 

john read a book and then he burned it

(31) 

1 j

⇒ ∃
human
b
(
::
∃
            ContentOf c b
( , )

::
(

book
∧

c
::
∃
Read j c
( , )

content  
)
Burn j b
( , ))

)(

)(

∧

That is, there is  some  unique object  of type human (named  j),  some book b, some 
content c, such that c is the content of b, and such that j read c and burned b. As 
pointed  out  in  a  previous  section,  it  should  also  be  noted  here  that  these  type 
unifications are often retracted in the presence of additional information. For example, 
in  ‘John  borrowed  Das  Kapital  from  the  library.  He  did  not  agree  with  it’  the 
resolution  of  `it'  would  eventually  result  in  the  introduction  of  an  abstract  content 
object  (which  one  might  not  agree with),  as  one  does not  agree (or  disagree)  with a 
physical object, an object that can indeed be borrowed7. 

7    Interestingly,  the  resolution  of  ‘it’,  in  addition  to  introducing  a  content  object,  should  result  in  Das 
Kapital, since one cannot agree or disagree with a library, but with the content of the library’s books.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
6   Towards Discovering the Structure of Commonsense Knowledge 

Throughout this paper we have tried to demonstrate that a number of challenges in the 
semantics  of  natural  language  can  be  easily  tackled  if  semantics  is  grounded  in  a 
strongly-typed ontology that reflects our commonsense view of the world and the way 
we talk about it  in  ordinary language. Our  ultimate  goal,  however,  is  the  systematic 
discovery of this ontological structure, and, as also argued in [2], [4] and [11], it is the 
systematic investigation of how ordinary language is used in everyday discourse that 
will  help  us  discover  (as  opposed  to  invent)  the  ontological  structure  that  seems  to 
underlie  all  what  we  say  in  our  everyday  discourse.  Recall,  for  example,  our 
suggestion of how a nominal compound such as ‘a book review’ is interpreted: 

a book review

λ⇒

P x
[(
∃

::

book

)(

∃

y

::

review

)(

ReviewOf y x
( , )

∧

P y

( ))]

(31) 

Note that this analysis itself seems to shed some light on the nature of the ontological 
categories under consideration. For example, (31) seems to be an instance of a more 
generic  template  that  can  adequately  represent  the  compositional  meaning  of  a 
number of similar nominal compounds, as illustrated in (a) below. 

                     (a)                                                                     (b) 

Similarly, as suggested in (b) above, it seems that the semantic analysis of a nominal 
compound  such  as  ‘brick  house’,  for  example,  suggests  that  a  number  of  nominal 
compounds can be semantically analyzed according to the following template: 

a N
λ⇒

N

substance
P x
::
[(
∃

artifact
artifact

)(

y
∃

::

substance

)(

MadeOf x y

( ,

)

∧

P x

( ))]

The  general  strategy  we  are  advocating  can  therefore  be  summarized  as  follows:  (i) 
we can start our semantic analysis by assuming a set of ontological categories that are 
embedded  in  the  appropriate  properties  and  relations  (based  on  our  use  of  ordinary 
language);  (ii)  further  semantic  analysis  of  some  non-trivial  phenomena  (such  as 
nominal  compounds,  intensional  verbs,  metonymy,  etc.)  should  help  us  put  some 
structure  on  the  ontological  categories  assumed  in  step  (i);  and  (iii)  this  additional 
structure  is  then  iteratively  used  to  repeat  the  entire  process  until,  presumably,  the 
nature of the ontological  structure that seems to be implicit in everything  we say  on 
ordinary language is well understood. 

 
 
 
 
              
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7   Concluding Remarks 

The  thesis  presented  in  this  paper  is  the  following:  assuming  the  existence  of  an 
ontological structure that reflects our commonsense view of the world and the way we 
talk about in ordinary language would make the semantics of various natural language 
phenomena nearly trivial. Although we could not, for lack of space, fully demonstrate 
the  utility  of  our  approach,  recent  results  we  have  obtained  suggest  an  adequate 
treatment of a number of phenomena, such as the semantics of nominal compounds, 
lexical ambiguity, and the resolution of quantifier scope ambiguities, to name a few. 
More importantly, it seems that a gradual imbedding of commonsense metaphysics in 
our  semantic  formalism  is  itself  what  will  help  us  discover  the  nature  of  the 
ontological structure that seems to underlie all that we say in our every discourse.
