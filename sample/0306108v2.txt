Abstract

Given a globally hyperbolic spacetime M , we show the existence of a smooth
spacelike Cauchy hypersurface S and, thus, a global diﬀeomorphism between M
and R

S.

1 Introduction

In a classical article published in 1970, Geroch [10] proved the equivalence,
for a spacetime, between global hyperbolicity and the existence of a Cauchy
hypersurface S. As he stated clearly, the results were obtained at a topological
R
level. In fact, he proved the existence of a continuous time function t : M
such that each level t =constant is a (topological) Cauchy hypersurface and,
then, M is homeomorphic to R
S. The improvement of these topological results
in smooth diﬀerentiable ones is important not only as a typical mathematical
challenge but also from the theoretical viewpoint: Cauchy hypersurfaces are the
natural subsets where initial conditions to diﬀerential equations (as Einstein’s
equation) are posed. Moreover, any achronal hypersurface N can be seen as a
graph on a Cauchy hypersurface; this allows to study several properties which

involve the diﬀerentiable structure of N (as mean curvature), provided that the
splitting is smooth; see for example, [7].

In general, continuous maps between smooth manifolds can be approximated
by smooth maps. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that, with some eﬀort, one
could ﬁll the details to strengthen the topological results. Some authors have
claimed that function t (and, thus, the Cauchy hypersurface) can be smoothed
and, therefore, M is diﬀeomorphic to R
S; for example, see the end of the
proof of Proposition 6.6.8 in the very inﬂuential book by Hawking and Ellis [12]
(or the more recent book [22, p. 209]). In fact, this has been assumed in very
diﬀerent contexts where smoothness seems unavoidable (see, for example, [8],
[13, Chapter 8] or [21]).

×

Nevertheless, as far as we know, general smoothing procedures have resisted
the attempts of formalisation. Budic and Sachs [4] proved C1-smoothing of
time functions for deterministic globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Then, Seifert
[19] claimed the existence of a general procedure for smoothing time functions.
But his proof is complicated and seems unclear; no cleaner version of this result
has been published since then. Later on, Dieckmann [6, 5] clariﬁes some points
in Geroch’s proof, but cites Seifert at the crucial point for smoothing (see [6,
proof of Theorem]). In general, in spite of these two references, most specialists
in pure Lorentzian Geometry do not aﬃrm that a smooth Cauchy hypersurface
must exist, even when the context could suggest it (say, expressions such as
“consider a globally hyperbolic spacetime with a smooth Cauchy hypersurface
S” are commonly used, when necessary). For example, among our references
clearly posterior to Seifert’s article, see [1, 2, 7, 9, 14, 16].

Summing up, Sachs and Wu [18, p. 1155] claimed in 1977:

...This is one of the folk theorems of the subject. It is not diﬃcult to
prove that every Cauchy surface is in fact a Lipschitzian hypersurface
in M [17]. However, to our knowledge, an elegant proof that his
Lipschitzian submanifold can be smoothed out to such an N above
is still missing.

This “folk question” is regarded as open in the ﬁrst edition of the classical book
by Beem and Ehrlich [1, p. 31], and remains open in the second edition of
1996, with Easley [2, p. 65]. As far as we know, no formalisation of the quoted
result has been obtained since then. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning
that some properties of volume functions (which appear in Geroch’s proof) have
been studied in [5] (see also [2, pp. 65–69]), and some smooth splitting results
in diﬀerent contexts have been obtained, see for example, [14], [2, Chapter 14].
The aim of the present article is to give a simple, self-contained and detailed

proof of the following result:

Theorem 1.1 Any globally hyperbolic spacetime admits a smooth spacelike Cauchy
hypersurface S0 and, then, it is diﬀeomorphic to R

S0.

×

This paper is organised as follows. Among the preliminaries in Section 2, we
state what can be asserted from Geroch’s splitting theorem, Lemma 2.2, Propo-
sition 2.5. In Section 3 some technical properties of Cauchy hypersurfaces are

2

proven. We do not try to give general properties here; plainly, we give direct
proofs to the results needed later, for the sake of clarity and completeness. We
prove, essentially (compare with [3], [9]): any closed spacelike hypersurface N
which lies in one side of a Cauchy hypersurface is achronal (Proposition 3.7)
and, thus, if it lies between two Cauchy hypersurfaces, then it is a Cauchy hy-
persurface too (Corollary 3.11). The necessity of the hypotheses is discussed
in Remarks 3.8, 3.10.
In Section 4 we prove Theorem 1.1, according to the
following two steps. Fix two Cauchy hypersurfaces, one of them, S1, in the past
of the other one, S2. Roughly:

(1) For each point p

S2 a smooth function hp with compact support can be
∈
constructed such that
hp is timelike (or 0) in the past of S2 (Lemma 4.12). This
function is constructed from the square of time-separation, which is either null
or a quadratic polinomial in normal coordinates and, thus, essentially smooth
(see formula (7)).

∇

(2) By using technical properties related to paracompactness (Lemma 4.13),
a locally ﬁnite set of these functions can be summed in such a way that the sum,
J −(S2), admits regular level hypersurfaces which are
h, restricted to J +(S1)
spacelike and do not touch each Si (Proposition 4.14).

and the term “smooth” will mean “Ck-diﬀerentiable”. Sometimes an auxiliary
complete Riemannian metric gR (with associated norm
R) will be needed.
Recall that the existence of a Riemannian metric on any paracompact manifold
(as those admitting a Lorentzian metric, see the discussion above Lemma 4.13)
is well-known; it can be chosen complete by using Whitney’s embedding theorem
(moreover, any Riemannian metric admits a conformal metric which is complete
[15]).

submanifold without boundary. H can be regarded as a subset of M and,
then, H will be closed if it is a closed subset of M . A spacelike hypersurface
is a embedded Cr-hypersurface (r
) such that its tangent space at
each point is spacelike. A Cauchy hypersurface in M is a subset S that is
met exactly once by every inextendible timelike curve in M . Then, S will be a
closed achronal connected (topological) hypersurface and it is intersected by any
inextendible causal curve [16, Lemma 14.29] (the intersection may be a closed
geodesic segment instead a single point, if the curve is lightlike there).

As S is a Cauchy hypersurface, then Φ is bijective and, by construction, Φ is a

Brouwer theorem on the invariance of the domain).

s is not necessarily a Cauchy hypersurface.

Proposition 2.4 Assume that the spacetime M is globally hyperbolic. Then
there exists a continuous and onto map t : M

(see also Theorem 3.26 in [2] as well as pp. 65–72, for a discussion about the
admissible measures `a la Dieckmann [5]). Then, as a consequence one has:

Then the continuous curve γx is timelike in the following sense:

⇒

γx(t) << γx(t′).

Sketch of proof. Deﬁne t(z) as in (3). By Proposition 2.4 S := t−1(0) is a
Cauchy hypersurface, and one only has to choose ρ from Φ−1 as in the proof of
Lemma 2.2.

Notice that, if function t were smooth, then the property (b) would imply di-
t is everywhere causal. Even more, if γ were an integral curve
rectly that
t and γ′(t0) were lightlike, γ′ could not be lightlike on some open interval
of
containing t0 (as t is taken from Proposition 2.4, its item (2) holds).

Notice that Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 2.5 give two types of topological
splittings Φ, Ψ for M , being the curve s
(s, x) timelike and smooth for Φ,
and the hypersurface t =constant a Cauchy hypersurface for Ψ. In what follows,
the properties of the Cauchy hypersurfaces of a globally hyperbolic spacetime
M will be studied. Then, we will assume that a topological splitting either as
in Lemma 2.2 or as in Proposition 2.5 is ﬁxed, and we will drop Φ, Ψ writting

3 Some properties of Cauchy hypersurfaces

First, recall the following technical result.

Lemma 3.6 Let M be a spacetime and N a closed connected spacelike hyper-
surface.

(1) A closed curve that meets N exactly once and then transversally is not

freely homotopic to a closed curve that does not meet N .

(2) If N separates M (i.e., M

\

N is not connected) then N is achronal.

Assertion (1) comes from intersection theory; it is a particular case of, for ex-
ample, [11, Sect. 2.4, Theorem in p. 78]. The proof of (2) can be seen in [16,
Lemma 14.45(2)].

Proposition 3.7 Let M be a spacetime which admits a Cauchy hypersurface
S. Then any closed connected spacelike hypersurface N which does not intersect
S is achronal.

Proof: By Lemma 3.6(2) it is enough to show that N separates M . Otherwise,
reasoning by contradiction, recall that there exists a closed curve γ : [

M which intersects N exactly once and, then, transversally. In fact, it is enough

1 then the
corresponding helix H ′ does not crosses S (in fact, it lies strictly between two
Cauchy hypersurfaces). But H ′ fails to be closed and is neither achronal.

Recall that, as N is achronal, then it can be seen as a graph on an open subset
of the Cauchy hypersurface. In order to assume that this graph is deﬁned on
all the hypersurface, the following result gives a suﬃcient condition.

disjoint Cauchy hypersurfaces, with S1 ⊂

Remark 3.10 Even though, by Proposition 3.7, only one of the inclusions S
⊂
I −(S2) is enough to ensure the achronality of S, both inclusions
I +(S1) or S
are needed for Proposition 3.9. The reason relies in the central role of inequality
(5), and it is not diﬃcult to obtain a counterexample if one of them is removed.
In fact, consider on R2 the warped metric g =
dt2 + f (t)2dx2 with f > 0 and
∂t future-directed. Each hypersurface t =constant is a Cauchy hypersurface,
ds2 + dx2), where I is some

1This extension can be easily carried out because the support of hp on J −(S2) lies in the
compact subset K = J +(p′) ∩ J −(S2) ⊂ Cp. Fix an open neighbourhood U of K included
in Cp, consider the covering (U, Cp\K) of Cp, and take the subordinate partition of the unity
{µ, µ′} with support(µ) ⊂ U . Then, hp can be chosen on all Cp as the expression in (7)
multiplied by µ.
