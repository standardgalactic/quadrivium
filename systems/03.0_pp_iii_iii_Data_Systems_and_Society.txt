Data, Systems, and Society
Harnessing the power of data and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods
to tackle complex societal challenges requires transdisciplinary collabor-
ations across academia, industry, and government. In this compelling book,
Munther A. Dahleh, founder of the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society
(IDSS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offers a blueprint for
researchers, professionals, and institutions to create approaches to prob-
lems of high societal value using innovative, holistic, data-driven methods.
Drawing on his experience at IDSS and knowledge of similar initiatives
elsewhere, Dahleh describes in clear, non-technical language how statistics,
data science, information and decision systems, and social and institutional
behavior intersect across multiple domains. He illustrates key concepts with
real-life examples from optimizing transportation to making healthcare
decisions during pandemics to understanding the media's impact on elec-
tions and revolutions. Dahleh also incorporates crucial concepts such as
robustness, causality, privacy, and ethics and shares key lessons learned
about transdisciplinary education and about unintended consequences of
AI and algorithmic systems.
Munther A. Dahleh is William Coolidge Professor of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science and Founding Director of the Institute for Data,
Systems, and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is
well known for his seminal contributions to the foundations of the ﬁeld of
decisions under uncertainty, impacting several application domains includ-
ing transportation systems, power grids, and social, economic, and ﬁnan-
cial networks. He is a four-time recipient of the IEEE CSS George S. Axelby
Outstanding Paper Award for papers in the IEEE Transactions on
Automatic Control and the 1993 recipient of the Eckman Award for
outstanding control engineers under 35.

"I'm often asked by students what they should be studying in
the modern era, and my standard response for some years has
been 'control theory, economics, and statistics.' Munther
Dahleh has been a living embodiment of this blend for as long
as I have known him, in this book one accompanies Munther
on his very ﬁne adventure in bringing an entire institution into
the fold. I hope and expect that many people will read this
book, including future historians."
— Michael I. Jordan, University of California, Berkeley
"Munther Dahleh's breadth of knowledge is showcased in this
discussion that ranges from the history of AI to the building of
the world's preeminent institute of data science. Munther pro-
vides fascinating insights on the challenges, promise, and suc-
cesses of using data to improve societies, and delivers a must-
read for everyone from budding data scientists to policymakers
and institution builders."
— Matthew O. Jackson, Stanford University
