THE CARE AND FEEDING OF A NEW
DISCIPLINE AT MIT
The fact that many critical real-world problems don't ﬁt neatly
into any one academic discipline is not a new insight. Nor are efforts to
bring multiple disciplines together in ad hoc groupings to pursue effect-
ive solutions to such challenges. Within academia, however, many of
those initiatives and outcomes have proved transitory, if not ephemeral,
in terms of having a sustained impact on society at large. Notable
exceptions to this general phenomenon in the modern era are the
disciplines of molecular biology and computational genetics - both of
which grew out of interdisciplinary initiatives.
Among the hurdles to sustaining multidisciplinary and interdis-
ciplinary work are the absence of a sense of community and a coherent
culture among the diverse participants in such ventures. Those factors
result in, and are exacerbated by, a lack of shared journals, conferences,
core topics, common knowledge, and administrative clarity typical of a
robust and productive disciplinary community.
Missing, too, are the broadly shared multidisciplinary chal-
lenges and open problems that sustain research endeavors and create
breakthroughs over time - despite the fact that shared problems requir-
ing extensive data-science expertise are on the rise. This factor, how-
ever, is rapidly changing as data becomes more accessible and software
is commodiﬁed. All these deﬁcits complicate evaluation for hiring,
promotion, and tenure and hamper efforts to attract such essential
resources as internal and external funding, space, infrastructure, and
institutional backing. Entities in industry and government often engage
in interdisciplinary research, but those activities are not sufﬁcient to

create a disciplinary culture. A brief historical overview sheds light on
how the MIT initiative around IDSS developed.
A Snippet of IDSS History
In December 2013, then Dean of Engineering Ian Waitz asked
me to lead an initiative to conceive an academic unit rooted in systems
and data science. His request didn't come out of thin air. A few years
earlier, Ian invited me to join a committee (chaired by my colleague Ron
Rivest) that was assessing whether the Engineering Systems Division,
then approximately 15 years old, was progressing in a way that aligned
with the rest of MIT. In the midst of that work, the committee shifted its
focus to examine what type of entity would best serve the Institute,
given the growing roles of data and systems across all domains. Our
committee ultimately recommended the creation of a new entity to
facilitate this transformative phenomenon. Concurrent with those
efforts, Ian formed another committee to address how MIT could ofﬁ-
cially incorporate statistics into its offerings. This second endeavor was
particularly urgent because MIT had been seeking a solution to that
challenge for four decades.
Ian and I, in close consultation with then Associate Dean of
Engineering Cindy Barnhart and in coordination with then Provost
Chris Kaizer, assembled a committee of 40 faculty and staff to help
delineate the blueprints for this novel entity. I recall Cindy joking at the
time, "Munther is trying to kill this project by having 40 faculty
members on a committee" - a quip that belied the signiﬁcant challenge
of reaching consensus among such a large group. We ultimately secured
the endorsement of 38 committee members with two dissenters.
I dedicated substantial time to comprehending the thinking of the
dissenters, and for the most part, their perspectives proved to be well-
founded, constructive, and efﬁcacious to the formation of the entity.
We established four subcommittees, each with a speciﬁc focus -
vision, structure, education, and statistics. These sub-committees
engaged in extensive cross-discussions, tirelessly working toward a
consensus on the mission and vision of the new entity. Their ﬁndings
ultimately led to the emergence of the triangle concept I've discussed at
some length in this book. With the vision established, the outcomes of
the structure, education, and statistics sub-committees seemed to natur-
ally align and fall into place. We reached consensus about statistics and
90

data science being at the core of the new entity while also promoting a
strong connection to the systems that generate such data. We had
dissent, however, on the structure of faculty hiring (another topic
I cover extensively in this book). Our 40-member committee produced
a blueprint and submitted our report ("Report on the Formation of a
New Entity in the Areas of Complex and Socio-technical Systems,
Information and Decision Systems, and Statistics") to the provost
for evaluation.
Marty Schmidt, the newly appointed provost at that time,
released the report to the MIT community to gather feedback, and we
received plenty. I responded to as many comments as possible and
adjusted the structure of the entity as appropriate. In the fall of 2014,
we soft-launched the New Entity using that name as a temporary title.
I devoted the next 12 months to assembling a leadership team and,
along with those colleagues, translating our visionary concept into
practical reality.
Choosing an appropriate permanent name proved to be a chal-
lenge. Initially, we considered (and soon abandoned) the Institute for
Statistics and Information Sciences (ISIS) - for obvious reasons.
I suggested the Institute for Data and Systems, with the possible add-
ition of "for the beneﬁt of society," because I wanted to convey our
strong societal focus. When I consulted Martha Eddison Sieniewicz, a
communications consultant to then MIT President Rafael Reif, she
suggested IDSS. Nearly everyone involved in the naming process found
Martha's variation appealing - and we had our name!
DSS as a transdiscipline is anchored in statistical thinking,
information and decision systems, abstractions, and ethical concerns.
To grow this new transdisciplinary activity into a thriving academic
discipline, the culture must promote deep engagements with domain
experts. This sense of this culture was not fully formed at the creation of
IDSS. Rather, it emerged through the process of thinking about the
foundations of what we were building and the structure and programs
that would promote collaborations.
IDSS Antecedents and Foundations
To place the launch of IDSS in the proper context, it's import-
ant to brieﬂy describe the MIT antecedents that shaped the foundation
for IDSS programs and activities. The DSS transdiscipline emerged not
91
/

as a break with the past but as the latest fruition of many intersecting
historical and present-day academic initiatives at MIT. That context is
key to understanding how we choose to proceed.
Chapter 2 of this book includes some historical perspectives on
the computational revolution that laid a foundation for the explosion of
machine
learning
and
AI
research
and
applications.
The
new
transdiscipline of DSS is more focused on addressing societal problems
with data and systems. When I look back across the seven decades that
preceded the founding of IDSS, I see a handful of key developments and
entities that set the stage for our new transdiscipline at MIT. Those
developments comprise evolutions in system theory, information and
decision sciences, social and economic networks, and econometrics.
In many respects, one might aptly dub DSS as "Cybernetics 2.0."
What sets this approach apart is its innovative integration of systems
thinking into the realm of data and information, forging a uniﬁed
methodology to effectively tackle intricate societal challenges.
1940s-1950s
Servomechanism Lab established at MIT featuring the
Aircraft Stability Analyzer and Whirlwind project that
developed the ﬁrst high-speed computer, headed by
J.W. Forrester, who is credited with perfecting magnetic
core-memory, the forerunner to today's random-access
memory (RAM). Forrester also founded the ﬁeld of
system dynamics, which integrates social dynamics with
engineered systems. Claude E. Shannon introduced
information theory in his 1949 book A Mathematical
Theory of Communication, which had a profound
impact on communication systems and statistics.
Weiner summarized his work in Cybernetics that
became the genesis of system theory and feedback as a
way of modeling all kinds of interactions ranging from
technical and biological to social.
1960s
Modern control theory advanced by a core group of
faculty members in MIT's Engineering Systems
Laboratory (ESL)) - an evolution of the
Servomechanism Lab - in such key publications as
"Analytical Design of Linear Feedback Controls"
(G. C. Newton, L. A. Gould, and J. F. Kaiser) and
Optimal Control: An Introduction to the Theory and
Its Applications (M. Athans and P. L. Falb). Robert

G. Gallager contributed to the evolution of coding
theory with the invention of low-density parity-check
(LDPC) codes in 1963, but it would be 30 years before
LDPC codes would be applied directly in computing.
1974
Herman Chernoff joins the MIT Mathematics
Department to build a statistics presence at the Institute.
He subsequently left MIT in 1985 without much success
in launching a statistics effort.
1978
ESL evolves into the Laboratory for Information and
Decision Systems (LIDS), expanding its scope to address
a broader range of problems requiring the methods and
perspectives of information, decision, and control and
generating key publications such as Data Networks (D.
P. Bertsekas and R. G. Gallager).
1970s-1980s
Jerry Hausman, Frank Fisher, and Dan McFadden helped
to establish the foundations of modern econometric
analysis. Each published important work that shaped the
ﬁeld, including McFadden's "Conditional Logit Analysis
of Qualitative Choice Behavior" on discrete choice
models and Hausman's "Speciﬁcation Tests in
Econometrics" on speciﬁcation analysis. During this
period, MIT launched its Technology and Policy Program
to address the challenging policy questions emerging from
new technologies.
1980s-2000s
Robust control theory, intelligent control systems, and
distributed computation were developed and supported
by the publication of Parallel and Distributed
Computation (D. P. Bertsekas and J.N. Tsitsiklis).
Computational approaches to control and
reinforcement learning developed and represented in
such publications as Neurodynamic Programming (D.
P. Bertsekas and J.N. Tsitsiklis) and Control of
Uncertain Systems: A Linear Programming Approach
(M. A. Dahleh and I. Diaz-Bobillo).
2000s
New foundations laid in convex and non-convex
analysis put forward in Sum of Squares: Theory and
Applications (P. A. Parrilo and R. R. Thomas),
inference, ML, and graphical methods found in Gossip
Algorithms (D. Shah).

IDSS Antecedents and Foundations

2010s
Physical, economic, and social networks have become
important areas of academic research and problem-
solving. "Systemic Risk and Stability in Financial
Networks" and other work by Daron Acemoglu, Asu
Ozdaglar, and Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi contributed
greatly to the areas of network economics, cascades,
and systemic risk. Alex "Sandy" Pentland's Social
Physics pushed the boundaries of our understanding of
the underpinnings of social interconnections.
2015
MIT launched IDSS to integrate the Institute's broader
activities in science, technology, humanities, arts, and
social sciences with data-driven research aimed at
solving various societal challenges. IDSS integrated
multiple developments in statistics, information,
and decision sciences to deﬁne the fundamental
principles for data-driven research addressing societal
problems.
2019
MIT established the Schwarzman College of Computing
to strengthen computing studies and research across
all disciplines.
With this rich legacy encompassing systems theory, information theory,
social and economic networks, econometrics, and cybernetics, the IDSS
transdisciplinary approach converges at the crossroads of these
domains. Such developments laid the groundwork for interactions
among physical, social, and institutional systems that formed the foun-
dation of our triangle.
The New Statistics
Given the vibrancy of information and decision sciences at MIT, we
turned our attention to statistics. As noted earlier in the timeline at the
beginning of this chapter, Chernoff came to MIT to launch an effort in
statistics. Unfortunately, that effort failed and Chernoff departed for
Harvard. The timeline also highlights that econometrics continued to
thrive at MIT, despite the absence of a central statistics effort. Given the
fact that MIT always has been a strong engineering institution, statistics
and data-driven thinking already were present in almost every discip-
line. The Department of Economics, as well, pushed for laying the
94
/
The Care and Feeding of a New Discipline at MIT

foundations of econometrics early on. As a result, no one unit could
claim ownership of this important ﬁeld.
This was evident in the many courses offered by multiple aca-
demic units at MIT, each addressing statistics from the perspective of its
own domain. What we lost with this approach was the opportunity of
having such efforts collide and interact both in education and research.
Given the critical role data played in the IDSS vision, our response was
to create the Statistics and Data Science Center (SDSC) to focus on the
educational needs of a new kind of statistics that was emerging. A key
innovation of the center was to create an option for statistics not to
reside in any single unit within MIT (a solution for which MIT lacked
an aptitude). At long last, we had a cohesive statistics effort at MIT that
could operate at the intersection of all domains.
SDSC provided the platform we needed to develop and teach
new, twenty-ﬁrst-century statistics suited to the issues and methods
associated with big data: large, noisy, and unlabeled data sets; high
dimensional, noisy, and possibly sparse data; multiscale, time-varying
data sets; rare and highly aggregated data; and intervention and experi-
mental design. All those issues come into play when we attempt to solve
complex societal problems using machine-learning tools and algorith-
mic and optimization methods. The new statistics enable us to assess the
accuracy and robustness of our models and to distinguish between
causality and correlation.
Building Bridges between Computational and
Social Sciences
In so far as statistics, information, and decision systems played
pivotal roles in shaping the new transdisciplinary approach of IDSS, so
did the domains of social sciences and humanities with their focus on
social and institutional behavior. The timeline presented earlier in this
chapter notes the seminal work of Forrester and Weiner in bringing
systems theory and feedback to the analysis of social systems. With the
incorporation of rich data sets going forward, the opportunity is
even greater.
First and foremost, IDSS needed to attract computational social
scientists among our existing faculty to serve as the bridge between
engineers, scientists, computer scientists, and social scientists and
humanists. In the design of a new doctoral program, the participation
95
/
Building Bridges between Computational and Social Sciences

of a co-advisor from the social sciences was essential to ensure that
students framed their inquiries to include perspectives extending beyond
purely technical considerations. IDSS faced the challenge of devising
methods to encourage and facilitate such interdisciplinary collabor-
ations while dismantling the natural barriers that arise from distinct
research approaches. More on that point further on in this book.
The Rationale for Integrating Domain Knowledge
Starting in 2015 and continuing into the 2020s, we at IDSS have
been intensely focused on how best to prepare the future data-science
learner. A distinctly MIT aspect of our efforts has been the focus on
systems in addition to data. Sustained and dynamic inquiries into systems
design and architecture that explain the data generation and support
modeling and prediction of system behaviors and performance are a
hallmark of IDSS activities. We believe that a systems-based methodology -
well integrated with domain knowledge - is essential to the success of data
science initiatives intent on delivering societal beneﬁts.
As ML became an accessible and standard research tool, how-
ever, many proponents of the technology wandered unbeknownst into a
danger zone. ML was, and still is, being applied to societal problems
without consideration for particular domain knowledge that may be
essential to understanding a complex system's design, behaviors, and
performance. Domains such as sociology and economics, for instance,
achieved disciplinary status before the advent of data science, and much
of the knowledge and practices of those disciplines are foreign to
contemporary data scientists.
Data science is most effective when it is fully integrated with
domain expertise and vice versa. Experts in biology, urban planning,
supply chains, chemical processes, pollution, or gender bias, for
example, must be equipped with a rigorous understanding of data
science and computational thinking to ensure a systematic approach
to research and problem-solving. In the context of our earlier discussion
about racial bias in Chapter 3, it's no wonder that combating systemic
racism has captured the attention of data scientists - and inspired a
speciﬁc initiative within IDSS (more on that project a little later in this
chapter). Effective research in this area certainly explores and collects
relevant data across multiple domains in which racism has been - and
continues to be - prominent.
96

The Care and Feeding of a New Discipline at MIT

Unfortunately, such research can lead to erroneous conclusions
and self-fulﬁlling cycles of inequities if it does not pay full attention to
how data are collected. Speciﬁc domain expertise is needed to identify
explicit and implicit ways that racial bias may seep into data collection
processes. Quantifying the uncertainty of results using data science also
plays a critical role here, as it does in the development of algorithmic
solutions in any domain. Assessing the reliability of our results must be
integrated into the implementation of our recommendations. Failing to
do so risks grave, regrettable, and potentially avoidable mistakes that
can cause personal harm or weaken society. One can project all of these
issues to the algorithmic bias created in the approval of loan applica-
tions to see the degree of damage data science can create. The work of
MIT MLK Professor Craig Watkins on facial recognition tools
(described in Chapter 3) is another example of this destructive
phenomenon.
Translating the IDSS Triangle into a Flagship
Academic Program
Having established some fundamental objectives and identiﬁed
a number of cautions, the founders of IDSS faced the practical challenge
of creating curricula that would be compelling to students and faculty
members - and be intelligible to the world outside MIT. The IDSS
signature PhD program, Social and Engineering Systems (SES), emerged
from those efforts.
Societal challenges, by their very nature, involve intensive data
about human activities (individual and institutional) as well as systems
that govern mechanisms for generating data and experimentation such
as engineering, economic, or ﬁnancial systems. We designed SES to
include core competencies and training necessary to tackle such chal-
lenges. It set the standard for rigorous analysis of those challenges and
created a common language for productive interactions among all
relevant domains.
The SES curriculum comprises the elements of the IDSS
Triangle (systems, human and social interactions, and institutional
interactions) on a foundation of three educational pillars:
 information sciences (probabilistic modeling, information theory,
optimization, and decision theory);
97
/
Translating the IDSS Triangle into a Flagship Academic Program

 twenty-ﬁrst century statistics (more on that later in this chapter);
 humanities and social science studies.
SES doctoral students acquire in-depth expertise in all three pillars as
they study one or more particular domains (e.g., energy systems,
ﬁnance, healthcare, social networks, urban systems, misinformation,
democracy, racism). The overall framework enables students to address
questions related to assessment, design, and ethics. It also enables our
graduates to pursue foundational research and knowledge discovery in
their particular domains and makes them distinctly powerful problem-
solvers in organizations seeking to solve complex societal challenges.
For individuals with backgrounds in the computational and
model-driven ﬁelds of engineering and computing, those ﬁrst two pillars
will seem quite natural. Traditional statistics involves mapping data to
probabilistic models that researchers and decision-makers can use for
prediction, intervention, and assessment. The third pillar, however,
introduces conceptual frameworks and research methods from the
social sciences and humanities that historically haven't been incorpor-
ated into computational modeling, such as collective/organizational
behavior and ethical guidelines.
SES PhD theses typically are problem-driven, so expertise in the
domain most closely related to the problem is essential. Without such
knowledge, abstractions may miss critical aspects of the challenge veer
toward meaninglessness. The core curriculum - and the mandatory PhD
seminar, in particular - teaches students how to formulate questions
and create abstractions that offer multiple views of a single problem or
set of closely related problems within any domain. Finally, the program
creates and sustains a culture of common tools and knowledge that
facilitates interactions among a variety of researchers across multiple
domains, which is why we consider SES to be the ﬂagship program
of IDSS.
Statistics and Data Science: Residential and
Online Education
To teach the new statistics within IDSS, we launched the
Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Statistics (IDPS) as well as an
undergraduate minor and the online MicroMaster's in Statistics and
Data Science. As a group, these three programs ensure that MIT
98
/
The Care and Feeding of a New Discipline at MIT

students at all levels - and from every department - have the opportun-
ity to develop an advanced understanding of twenty-ﬁrst century statis-
tics and data science. The curricula comprise concepts of probabilistic
modeling, statistics, computation, and data analysis within each stu-
dent's chosen ﬁeld of study. Many MIT programs from each of the
Institute's ﬁve schools have engaged with the IDPS program.
The Statistics and Data Science MicroMasters (SDS) online
program, launched in 2018, gives remote learners around the world
the opportunity to earn professional and academic credentials applic-
able to a variety of ﬁelds. Global demand for data scientists is high, and
the
ﬁeld
is
growing
rapidly.
SDS
helps
fulﬁll
the
need
for
transdisciplinary capabilities by providing both foundational know-
ledge and hands-on experience in statistics and data science. This online
program can be applied to residential programs at more than 25 path-
way universities. Those partnerships enable students to obtain high-
quality advanced degrees more efﬁciently and at less cost than trad-
itional programs.
The online (synchronous and asynchronous) format of this
program also enables us to customize the offering to the needs of any
partner institution. Our ﬂagship collaboration with Aporta, a social
impact lab founded in Peru by the business conglomerate Breca, has
led us to multiple other collaborations across the world. Within Aporta,
Briet (Brescia Institute of Technology) is a social impact lab founded by
Ana Maria Brescia Cafferata (co-owner of the Breca Group) in 2018 to
promote societal development. The IDSS component focuses on creating
the next generation of data scientists among Peruvian nationals. The
program combines hands-on technical training with soft-skills develop-
ment in leadership and teamwork. The Peruvian students also partici-
pate regularly in MIT online events and initiatives such as ISOLAT,
MIT's data-driven global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
IDSS's dedication to online education aligns with the growing
societal focus on the importance of learning opportunities. The demand
for education in data science is not only widespread globally but also
essential at the professional level. Alongside the MicroMasters, IDSS
and its faculty have developed various online programs to provide
professional education in Data Science, Machine Learning, and
Artiﬁcial Intelligence to learners worldwide. These programs adhere to
a principled approach that is consistent with IDSS's overarching
value proposition.

Statistics and Data Science: Residential and Online Education

Technology Policy Program
At the professional level, IDSS hosts the Master of Science in
Technology and Policy Program (TPP), which ﬁrst launched at MIT in
1976. TPP's mission is to develop leaders who can create, reﬁne, imple-
ment, and evaluate responsible policies informed by an understanding
of technology and its instruments, as well as the broad social contexts in
which those tools are deployed. By combining a core of science and
engineering study with applied social sciences, TPP students develop
strengths in both a technical ﬁeld (e.g., telecom networks, energy,
transportation, healthcare, the environment) and policy processes.
With the emersion in IDSS, TPP supports data-driven policy research
(both evaluation and experimental analysis) and addresses important
policy issues with data privacy and ethical consideration. The program
complements the other existing academic programs.
The Human Architecture of a New Transdiscipline
The particulars of how we built the new academic unit of IDSS
likely are relevant to existing and future initiatives at other institutions.
More useful still, I think, are the underlying principles that informed the
choices we made. We used the vision of the IDSS Triangle (discussed in
detail in Chapter 4) as a means of thinking about complex, multidimen-
sional problems in a variety of speciﬁc domains. That vision required us
to apply statistical and systems thinking as frameworks for making
decisions under uncertainty as well as to convene and sustain a new
mix of people who could bring our vision to life.
The committee responsible for shaping IDSS at its inception
proposed that this novel entity be designated an Institute at MIT.
In the context of MIT, an Institute is akin to a department, the
distinction being the composition of its faculty. Faculty members at
an MIT Institute can hail from various departments and hold joint
positions within MIT, resulting in a unique cross-disciplinary
dynamic. Given the expansive scope of IDSS, faculty could belong
to any department among MIT's ﬁve schools. When it was estab-
lished, therefore, IDSS reported to all the deans of the ﬁve schools.
That changed in 2019 when IDSS became part of the newly formed
Schwarzman College of Computing. As one of the objectives of the
new college was to bring computing to various domains, it became
100
/
The Care and Feeding of a New Discipline at MIT

clear that IDSS - with an aligned, yet more speciﬁc, vision - should
become an independent unit within the college.
The organizational structure of a new academic entity is crucial
to the realization of its vision, and universities can struggle to accom-
modate nontraditional structures while fostering the growth into inter-
disciplinary education and research. From our perspective, IDSS's role
was to infuse a transdisciplinary ethos into diverse disciplines. The
structural framework we chose was designed to incentivize all partici-
pating departments to actively contribute to IDSS's success, in large part
because their faculty held joint appointments in our Institute. That
arrangement was often likened to reverse ownership, and it gave each
department a stake in IDSS's accomplishments.
Faculty Hiring
On the faculty side, we sought a range of experts related to
statistics - theoretical and applied. Such candidates' expertise might
overlap with information and decision sciences (i.e., interconnections,
networks, feedback, optimization) - as well as speciﬁc domains with a
particular focus on the social sciences. Our goal was to create a vibrant,
multidimensional educational effort in statistics that would attract stu-
dents who were eager to focus their master's or doctoral work on
solving complex societal problems. In addition, those students needed
sustained access to a variety of domain experts (e.g., faculty members in
environmental science, economics, political science, management, etc.).
Given those objectives, we knew that launching IDSS as trad-
itional academic department - which typically organizes around a core
set of courses, topics, research areas, and faculty members - would
hinder our objective of intersecting with many, or all, existing MIT
departments. We also had no interest in dictating to any existing
department what they should teach its students within its domain.
Instead, we wanted to infuse our new statistical, information-systems,
and decision-systems thinking and methodologies within each depart-
ment interested in engaging with IDSS. We wanted to build a
transdiscipline that could build bridges among disciplines and enable
each department to take ownership of the development of our transdis-
cipline within their respective domains.
With those transdisciplinary organizing principles to guide us,
we used a nontraditional approach for faculty hiring and student
101
/
Faculty Hiring

recruitment. The last thing we wanted was to disconnect existing faculty
members from their departments, or worse, bring in new faculty
members who lacked strong departmental ties to existing domains at
MIT. The approach we adopted - which persists to this day - was to
comprise a faculty of core members who belonged partially to IDSS and
partially to their home departments. They agreed to divide their teach-
ing and administrative responsibilities equally between both entities and
to work with students who integrated the data and systems aspects of
IDSS with the problems and methods of the applicable domains.
Rather than redirect, distract, or otherwise derail any faculty
members from domain-speciﬁc research and teaching, our model helped
boost the reach and rigor of disciplinary work. The presence of IDSS
faculty members with core competencies in statistics, data science, infor-
mation systems, decision science, and social sciences ensured access to
the foundational education and research activities that experts in other
disciplines could utilize and adapt within their domains.
That opportunity was easy to sell to tenured MIT professors in
established departments, but it presented potential complications for
junior faculty members and non-tenured new hires. The risk, at least
initially, was that dividing their time between their home departments
and IDSS would be perceived as a distraction from research, teaching, and
home-department responsibilities that pave the path to tenure. To avoid
that pitfall, senior IDSS faculty placed special emphasis on mentoring
junior colleagues in applying IDSS resources to pioneering research within
their home domains. MIT as a whole also played an important role in the
early years by helping to fund novel research empowered by our new
transdiscipline until it became institutionalized within each domain.
At the end, the interaction between IDSS and various departments gave
a huge advantage to the newly hired junior faculty.
IDSS bears a signiﬁcant responsibility to assist departments in
building capacity within the emerging transdiscipline of data, systems,
and society (DSS), especially through faculty recruitment. Those efforts
include jointly managed search committees that identify and attract the
right candidates. Although each department may have a distinct
approach to recruitment, the involvement of IDSS ensures that all
candidates are aligned with the intended vision for the respective pos-
itions. While that process poses challenges, it also promotes an under-
standing within MIT departments of the role and competency of
recruited faculty.

Nurturing the Trilingual Student
In conceiving academic programs for IDSS, we were very delib-
erate about nurturing trilingual students. In addition to being experts in
statistics and information sciences, those individuals also would need to
possess a deep understanding of social and institutional behavior along-
side expertise in their chosen research domains. Our recruitment process
extended
beyond
consideration
of
mere
academic
excellence.
We identiﬁed students who were determined to transcend traditional
disciplinary boundaries to focus on addressing pressing societal chal-
lenges. The students who joined IDSS embodied an entrepreneurial
spirit that facilitated their navigation of intricate domains, the forging
of valuable collaborations and, ultimately, the realization of the IDSS
vision. Our experience shows that such students exhibit remarkable
versatility, effortlessly traversing various domains thanks to their excep-
tional competence in statistics, information science, and the founda-
tional aspects of social and institutional studies.
Collaboration among our students across various MIT units is
key to the success of our educational and research programs. The concept
of research groups - colleagues working collaboratively on shared object-
ives with students and postdocs - is very common among, engineers and
computer scientists. That approach - which is a critical component of
IDSS programs - is much less common in the social sciences and human-
ities. At IDSS, we took on the signiﬁcant task of bridging such gaps
between academic communities by addressing ﬁnancial dependencies
and nurturing a culture of engagement that encourages individuals to
step outside their comfort zones and work collaboratively.
The distinct nature of SES, in which students are supervised by
multiple faculty (with a strong emphasis on humanities and social sci-
ences), inspired us to dedicate ﬁnancial resources to support student
research. The overarching objective is to provide equitable support for
students to freely explore open-ended societal problems. IDSS plays a
crucial role as an enabler of new research, by providing essential resources
for lines of inquiry that may not align with conventional research in
speciﬁc disciplines or domains. Over time, our transdisciplinary approach
has become institutionalized, and our researchers are ﬁnding it easier to
secure independent funding for their projects.
IDSS also enhances capacity through postdoctoral fellows who
work at the intersection of this emerging transdiscipline and numerous
103
/
Nurturing the Trilingual Student

speciﬁc domains. IDSS fellows collaborate directly with faculty
members from various ﬁelds across campus as well as their respective
students.
Professional Considerations in the Wider World
In tandem with ﬁguring out how the mindset and methods of
our transdiscipline ﬂow into traditional domains, we had to factor in
publishing options for core IDSS faculty as well as potential job pro-
spects for IDSS graduates. The importance of publications to an aca-
demic career arc is well established - both the quality of one's academic
papers and the prestige of the journals in which they appear are pivotal.
In the early years, becoming members of the DSS transdiscipline
required our faculty to continue publishing in domain-speciﬁc journals
while at the same time infusing the statistical, information systems, and
decision systems into their overall approaches. Over time, we also
expect to see and support the rise of more transdisciplinary-centric
journals that welcome submissions from a wide range of domains
(Harvard Data Science Review, launched in 2019, is an early example
of such publications).
Our early emphasis on high-quality, domain-speciﬁc publica-
tions was essential for our graduate students. Many published their
transdisciplinary work in well-respected disciplinary journals and
launched their scholarly careers at academic institutions with compar-
able rigor to MIT. Progressing from master's and doctoral studies into
private sector jobs was never a problem for our graduates. Business and
industry have always been much less siloed than academia, and the
transdisciplinary capabilities of IDSS alumni enable them to formulate
and solve complex, dynamic problems with entirely new tools -includ-
ing those that have yet to be invented.
Academic job placements also can be challenging to secure
without successful discipline-speciﬁc publications. At IDSS, we're
helping students bridge that gap by actively engaging with established
disciplinary ﬁelds to which our students contribute.
Physical Space Is Critical
The IDSS space has been crucial for fostering collaboration and
innovation within our academic institution. Our senior administrative
104

team recognized that physical space for IDSS - a truly scarce resource at
MIT - would be crucial to achieving our stated mission. The IDSS space
accommodates students, postdocs, and faculty in shared ofﬁces (a con-
ﬁguration that has turned out to be both sufﬁcient and preferred by
the occupants).
The space has allowed for spontaneous interactions and
random encounters that facilitate learning about each other's work - a
phenomenon that is difﬁcult to replicate virtually. The physical inter-
action has been particularly effective in enabling students to learn from
both their peers and faculty members. The IDSS space also provides a
venue for events, seminars, and social gatherings and houses capabilities
such as a visualization lab. Overall, the space serves as a welcoming hub
for researchers to explore collaboration opportunities and expand the
interdisciplinary nature of our work.
Initiative on Combatting Systemic Racism: Case in Point
Racism is one of America's most enduring and formidable
existential challenges. Researchers have illuminated racial discrimin-
ation across various facets of society - labor market, the criminal
justice system, education, healthcare, housing access, ﬁnancial ser-
vices, and many others. At several earlier points in this book, we've
addressed the critical issue of systemic bias and its intricate relation-
ship with the ﬁelds of computing and data science. When we address
systemic racism, our focus is not on individual prejudice but rather on
the systems in place that inadvertently exacerbate biases against
Blacks, Latinos, and other historically underserved communities.
Those systems may not harbor explicit intentions to perpetuate such
biases, but the unintended consequences do so, nonetheless. As we
have illustrated in earlier chapters, computation and data have played
a signiﬁcant role in amplifying the effects of racism in areas ranging
from the US Census, policing, and surveillance to climate justice,
credit scoring, and healthcare.
When my colleague Fotini Christia and I launched the Initiative
on Combatting Systemic Racism in 2021, we recognized that IDSS
provided the ideal platform for this complex endeavor. By deﬁnition,
DSS is a transdisciplinary ﬁeld that serves as the foundational method-
ology for addressing challenges that span multiple institutional and
policy domains. We also discerned the intricate interplay among various

domains such as housing and healthcare are inextricably intertwined in
their impact on Black communities in the US
IDSS is exceptionally well-positioned to foster collaboration
among faculty members from diverse disciplines who can help address
this challenge. We've leveraged the extensive body of literature within
the social sciences and forged partnerships across the technical ﬁelds of
data science and computing to tackle the issues highlighted by our social
science colleagues. Our transdisciplinary team has developed concept
papers that serve as cornerstones for broader collaboration among our
faculty, and we've included a few examples of that work in the
following sections.
Translating Analysis into Action
Beyond elucidating the problem, our mission includes develop-
ing proactive policy solutions to rectify racially inequitable outcomes
stemming from implicit or explicit biases entrenched in institutional
practices of both public and private sectors. We've expanded our work
to confront the evolving challenges introduced by the utilization of AI
and algorithmic methods in decision-making that exacerbate this
complex problem.
Our research collects and delves into vast data sets spanning
numerous domains. We meticulously examine data-collection processes
to pinpoint explicit or implicit sources of racial bias. We're using those
insights to develop and enhance data-driven computational tools engin-
eered that address racial disparities within the structures and institu-
tions that perpetuate discriminatory outcomes in the US economy and
broader society. Because the work is deeply rooted in ethical and
societal considerations, we're ﬁrmly committed to coordinating and
sharing our ﬁndings with local stakeholders from historically disadvan-
taged groups as well as to driving relevant policy decisions that will
contribute to a more equitable society.
IDSS students and postdocs are greatly inspired by and engaged
with this initiative. In the work, they face complex technical challenges
that demand sensitive and socially conscious solutions. They're delving
into problems ranging from the robust debiasing of data to the delicate
task of eliminating racial indicators without compromising valuable
societal information. They're also scrutinizing the persistence of histor-
ical patterns of segregation that continue to inﬂuence contemporary

Our research community naturally fosters transdisciplinary synergy
and facilitates the convergence of collaborators across diverse domains.
Outreach and Engagement
In seeking to combat systemic racism, IDSS has opened its doors
for outreach and engagement with historically underserved commu-
nities in both education and research endeavors. Leveraging the
Minority Summer Research Program (MSRP) at MIT, IDSS hosted a
cohort of students with a keen interest in conducting research in this
area. We welcomed those budding researchers by embracing their dis-
tinct life experiences and acknowledging their individual contributions.
Our core goals for the program were beautifully expressed in MSRP
student Savannah Gregory's reﬂection, "I feel conﬁdent that I am
viewed as an extension of the team, a member whose perspective is
valued. As I reﬂect on my experiences, I now see MIT and IDSS as
environments where intellect is nurtured and curiosity is actively
encouraged."
IDSS also has extended its online educational programs to
beneﬁt many students in historically Black colleges and universities
(HBCUs), offering them opportunities to delve deeper into the realm
of data science and its practical applications. Working with MIT
Professional Education and its partner Great Learning, we adapted the
highly successful Machine Learning and Data Science online course for
a summer program tailored to underserved students. We provided the
course free of charge and paired cohorts of students with MIT doctoral
teaching assistants who introduced students through this rapidly evolv-
ing ﬁeld. We expect the initiative to play a crucial role in developing the
pipeline of students interested in this domain.
A Deep Dive into Systemic Racism and Policing
My IDSS colleagues have undertaken diverse inquiries related
to systemic racism, including an examination of the root causes of
confrontations between the police and potential suspects. While the
media often emphasizes prejudice in interactions among police and
107
/

individuals of color, the work of IDSS faculty and students interrogates
additional contributing factors. We've learned, for example, that many
police-citizen interactions stem from 911 calls, prompting researchers to
query the possibility that biases embedded in those calls may inﬂuence
subsequent police behavior - and create a cascade of racist actions.
After analyzing a vast data set comprising more than 22 million
911 records and 400,000+ police stops, my IDSS colleagues Fotini
Christia, Devavrat Shah, Craig Watkins, and their SES students dis-
covered that calls related to people of color are more likely to result in
police actions versus reports involving White citizens. In
their
2024 paper "A causal framework to evaluate racial bias in law enforce-
ment system," the researchers investigated the sources of bias in various
scenarios including airport security, AI-driven security, and encounters
resulting from 911 calls. In the future, they hope to extend their study to
examine the content and sentiment of 911 calls to determine if they have
a causal impact on police actions that goes beyond simply over-
reporting. The research framework - built on extensive data and sophis-
ticated modeling that integrates disparate data sets - offers a robust
approach to comprehending aspects of the justice system marred by a
cascade of biased activities.
Housing and Eviction Disparities
Recent scholarly discourse conducted by my colleague Peko
Hosio and her SES student Aurora Zhang related to housing has shed
light on the intricate and compelling relationship between neighbor-
hood racial composition and eviction rates. Drawing from the rich
tapestry of the Eviction Lab data set, a rigorous exploration revealed
a pronounced and persistent correlation between neighborhood racial
composition and eviction rates - even after meticulous adjustments
for economic variables such as poverty rate, median income, and
median rent.
In the course of this academic pursuit, Two pivotal inquiries
have emerged from this academic research. The ﬁrst looks at the con-
cealed mechanisms underlying the integration of racial disparities into
the fabric of eviction. The second investigates whether the application of
causal inference methods can illuminate the study of policies designed to
disentangle and alleviate these disparities. The unfolding discourse on
these topics is poised to uncover layers of understanding and potential

responses to the nuanced interplay of neighborhood demographics and
ﬂuctuating patterns of eviction.
Discriminatory Online Content and Actions
As of the writing of this book, my colleagues are immersed in a
fascinating investigation that seeks to comprehend the relationship
between bias in social media and ofﬂine discriminatory behavior.
Numerous studies have already revealed that discriminatory content
online can translate into harmful real-world actions. Researchers are
delving into questions of how the depiction of various demographic
groups correlates with speciﬁc instances of ofﬂine discrimination. The
research seeks to establish whether individuals' identities and attributes
play a role in shaping the connection between online content consump-
tion and subsequent ofﬂine behavior. Taken as a whole, this growing
body of work continues to uncover systemic racism in multiple domains
ranging from healthcare and policing to housing, social media, and
climate change.
