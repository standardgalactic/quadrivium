ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
It often takes a village, and the collective effort of building IDSS
was no exception. Numerous individuals played pivotal roles in its
establishment. Although I cannot fully express the credit owed to each
person, I'd like to offer a few words about some of them.
The 40-member committee responsible for formulating the vision,
mission, and structure of IDSS engaged in profound deliberations about
the most effective path to success. Although the general blueprint provided
a directional guide for implementation anchored in a distinct and vibrant
vision, the pivotal role of the founding team extended beyond mere
planning. I cannot help but use superlatives to express my profound
admiration for this group of individuals - their exceptional brilliance,
unwavering dedication, and profound commitment were invaluable. It is
an understatement to say that none of the progress we've achieved would
have been possible without this remarkable team.
The composition of the leadership team corresponded to vari-
ous startup needs of IDSS - the development of the PhD program, the
launching of the Statistics and Data Science Center (SDSC), the adapta-
tion of the Technology Policy Program, the hiring of new faculty, and
the push for related initiatives across campus. Each team member had a
profound impact on the outcome of our new Institute.
Our Dream Team
A MIT colleague and friend at once posed a thought-provoking
question, "Who is the one individual without whom IDSS would not

have become a reality?" My unequivocal response was Ian Waitz, who
served as the dean of engineering during this pivotal period. Ian played
an extraordinary role not only by enabling this endeavor but also by
entrusting me and my leadership team with the responsibility of navi-
gating the complex terrain of creating this new entity. His unwavering
support and facilitation were truly exceptional. Among the MIT leader-
ship team, then Dean of Science Michael Sipser played a pivotal role in
the establishment of SDSC within IDSS. His perspective on statistics at
MIT, his vision for building a robust unit, and his support for the
leadership team were integral to the launch of IDSS.
My colleague Ali Jadbabaie is probably the most inﬂuential
ﬁgure in shaping my thinking during the creation of IDSS's vision
document. Ali is an institution builder and conﬁdant, and his invaluable
insights from his own research and from past initiatives at the University
of Pennsylvania were instrumental in shaping the new Institute's direc-
tion. Although he wasn't ofﬁcially a member of the 10-person subcom-
mittee tasked with crafting our vision document, his contributions in
absentia helped crystallize many of the group's discussions. The collab-
orative efforts of this subcommittee, coupled with Ali's personal sup-
port, enabled us to articulate a compelling vision for IDSS. When we
initiated the project, Ali joined MIT and became an integral part of the
founding team. He was involved in virtually every decision, from
designing academic programs to selecting the future entity's logo colors.
He also took the helm of the Sociotechnical Systems Research Center
(SSRC) and our ﬂagship PhD program SES.
My colleague John Tsitsiklis is a thoughtful, brilliant problem
solver, a team player, and possesses the ability to see all dimensions of a
challenge simultaneously. John initially led the committee responsible
for deﬁning the PhD SES program, which included key faculty members
from across MIT. Later, he assumed leadership of the LIDS - the oldest
lab at MIT - which subsequently became part of IDSS. John adeptly
managed LIDS's growth and fostered a harmonious and collaborative
relationship between this research lab and IDSS. John's most signiﬁcant
contribution, however, lies in his wisdom and ability to provide candid
feedback to the leadership team.
My colleague Devavrat Shah undertook the seemingly impos-
sible task of establishing an SDSC within IDSS. Under his guidance,
IDSS uniﬁed MIT's efforts in statistics and created several new academic
offerings - a minor in statistics and data science, an interdisciplinary
128

PhD in statistics, an online MicroMasters program (comprising
online MIT PhD-level courses), and a professional online course in data
science and ML. Devavrat's leadership and unwavering determination
achieved what MIT had been pursuing for more than 45 years, a
testament to his remarkable ability to surmount obstacles and make
things happen.
My colleague Alberto Abadie served as one of the Associate
Directors of IDSS and represented the MIT School of Humanities, Arts,
and Social Sciences (SHASS). Alberto's dedicated efforts were instru-
mental in promoting IDSS's vision within SHASS and recruiting faculty
to SDSC. He also provided vital support to the SES PhD program,
guiding new students in navigating this innovative program. Alberto's
research in statistics attracted numerous students to engage in compel-
ling research endeavors.
My colleague Noelle Selin, in her role as the director of the
Technology and Policy Program, injected her passion for science in
policymaking
into
leading
TPP
while
simultaneously
providing
guidance to the team in growing other units within IDSS. Noelle also
stepped up to lead IDSS after my departure in July 2023.
In my view, our core achievement at IDSS has been to build an
inclusive culture around data science and our new academic discipline.
Director of Administration and Finance Jennifer Kratochwill, my chief
of staff, played an essential role in shaping the culture of IDSS. Jennifer
embraced the challenge of engaging staff, students, postdocs, research
scientists, and faculty and fostered a culture of collaboration among our
diverse community, most notably the staff. Under her leadership, IDSS
services were consistently celebrated as among the best at MIT. Jennifer
was also a cofounder who offered critical and thoughtful advice, and
her ability to implement decisions was truly commendable. I still hear
her voice in my head whispering some valuable advice for dealing with
challenging situations.
Our staff played an essential role in the creation of IDSS. Beth
Milnes, IDSS's academic administrator, has been the driving force
behind our ﬂagship academic offering SES. The program charted new
territory in training trilingual students to conduct research that
addresses societal challenges. Navigating such a program from the
students' perspective can be in itself challenging. Beth has administered
this program since its inception with a keen instinct for the student
perspective, and she remains dedicated to its success. Beth's exceptional
129

talents and unwavering commitment to the students are major reasons
why this program has thrived.
Facilitating collaborations necessitated the establishment of a
highly resilient external partnership program. Elizabeth Bruce, who
inaugurated this function at IDSS, played a pivotal role in shaping the
framework for our collaborations. With her systematic approach to
engaging with corporations and presenting a clear value proposition,
Elizabeth signiﬁcantly contributed to establishing enduring external
partnerships for IDSS.
Lastly, my colleague Steven Graves played a pivotal role in
guiding the entire team throughout the establishment of IDSS. Steve's
extensive experience at MIT, his prior leadership of MIT's Engineering
Systems Division (ESD), and his thoughtful approach proved to be
invaluable assets as we embarked on our pioneering journey.
The Next Generation of Leaders
The sustainability of a new academic unit within a university
hinges on the participation of leaders capable of evolving the mission
and enhancing various aspects of the organization. A few years after the
inception of IDSS, several founding team members transitioned to new
roles. John and Devavrat stepped down, Ali transitioned to the depart-
ment head of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and new leaders
stepped into key positions.
Fotini Christia succeeded Ali in leading SSRC and the SES
program. It was imperative for IDSS to have a computational social
scientist (Fotini is a political scientist) take on a leadership role. Under
her stewardship, IDSS launched the Initiative on Combating Systemic
Racism, which garnered signiﬁcant participation from MIT faculty,
students, and postdocs. Fotini brought an abundance of energy and
enthusiasm to not only this initiative but also to her connections with
faculty in the social sciences and humanities. Fotini's exceptional inter-
personal skills and strategic acumen were evident in her leadership, and
her ability to connect people and her strategic insights made her an
invaluable asset to IDSS. Her contributions made her the prime candi-
date to lead IDSS. Now as the director she continues to branch out and
to connect the institute with other units at MIT.
My colleague Ankur Moitra assumed the role previously held
by Devavrat in leading SDSC. Ankur is known for his introspective and
130

systematic approach to driving success. He chose to support IDSS by
enhancing the SDSC course offerings in statistics during the ﬁrst two
years of student engagement. Ankur underscored the importance of
mathematical rigor in applied work and played a pivotal role in shaping
the foundation of statistics at MIT that Devavrat had established.
As I detailed earlier in this book, the pandemic presented IDSS
with its ﬁrst real-time challenge and afforded us the opportunity to
demonstrate our capacity for addressing urgent problems. We swiftly
restructured our operations to support data-driven decision-making.
In this endeavor, my colleague Annett (Peko) Hosoi played a pivotal
leadership role. Her relentless pursuit of pushing the boundaries of what
was achievable and her engaging approach to research elevated IDSS's
standing within MIT. Subsequent to our actions, many institutions
adopted MIT-inspired solutions for safely reopening their campuses.
The "when-to-test" app we developed ultimately found utility in numer-
ous schools and universities, with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
promoting it for broader use. Peko was also a great advisor and conﬁdant
for me personally throughout the launch and development of IDSS.
I consider the MITx MicroMasters program and our broader
online education initiatives among the most signiﬁcant contributions of
IDSS to academia. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Karene
Chu for her exceptional efforts in advancing the MicroMasters program
to its current state. I also extend my appreciation to all the faculty
members who have contributed to the MicroMasters, including
Devavrat Shah, John Tsitsiklis, Patrick Jaillet, Philippe Rigollet,
Tommi Jaakkola, Regina Barzilay, Esther Duﬂo, Sarah Ellison,
Caroline Uhler, and Stefanie Jegelka. Their dedication and expertise
have been instrumental in the success of those programs.
Looking beyond the MicroMasters program, IDSS has been
keenly focused on advancing online education to broaden access to AI
and ML. Our robust partnership with MIT Professional Education, under
the astute leadership of Bhaskar Pant, has played a pivotal role in this
endeavor. Moreover, I am deeply appreciative of the exceptional contri-
butions made by the Great Learning team, who have been instrumental in
delivering top-tier programs with the support of experts from around the
globe. I would liketo extend my heartfelt gratitude to Milind Kopikare and
Mohan Lakhamraju for their invaluable collaboration in our initiatives.
The impact of the MicroMasters is difﬁcult to overstate. One
important consequence is the collaboration with the Brescia family

through their social impact lab Aporta. The team at Aporta was simply
incredible. I am indebted to Jaime Aroaz Medanic and Luz Fernandez
for initiating and nurturing this partnership as well as to Lucia
Gonzales, who assumed Luz's role and continues to support the IDSS
mission through the MicroMasters program.
Thanks to Many Colleagues
In academia, achieving success extends beyond having a com-
pelling vision; it necessitates the cultivation of trust and garnering of
support from an array of individuals. Throughout the establishment of
IDSS, I had the privilege of collaborating closely with many dedicated
individuals who played pivotal roles in advancing our mission. While
I cannot possibly acknowledge everyone, I want to express my heartfelt
gratitude to several key ﬁgures including former MIT President Rafael
Reif, who embraced our vision and encouraged our formation, as well
as former Provost Marty Schmidt, whose rigorous attention to the
formation and generous ﬁnancial support were crucial.
Anantha Chandrakasan, who later became the dean of engin-
eering, also provided invaluable support and guidance during IDSS's
formation. Daron Acemoglu, who played an instrumental role in
shaping the vision of IDSS and later became an ambassador for the
Institute in the ﬁeld of economics. Sanjay Sarma, who led the Ofﬁce of
Digital Learning, played a pivotal role in the creation of the

insights, connections, and encouragement were truly remarkable.
My thanks, also, to UC Berkeley professor and researcher Michael
I. Jordan for his consistent support of our overall initiative as well as
of the statistics effort within IDSS in particular. Of course, I would like
to thank my students, as well as my friends and colleagues from my
research communities, particularly Jeff Shamma and John Doyle, for 35
years of invaluable discussions that have shaped my career.
These individuals, along with our dedicated faculty members,
have made immeasurable contributions to the success of IDSS, and I am
deeply grateful for their unwavering support and tireless efforts.
Numerous people have assisted IDSS and served on advisory boards,
and we owe a debt of gratitude for their valuable contributions.
Securing substantial funds was crucial for IDSS to function as a
research enabler. I extend our gratitude for the generous gift from
Phyllis Hammer, who supports the SES program, the generous gift from
Tom Seibel, who supports a faculty chair, and contributions from the
Brescia family, which have funded general operations and fellowships.
I also want to extend a special thanks to Alan Willsky, who
served as the director of LIDS during our initial efforts. His vision,
guidance, and support were instrumental in steering our team.
Lastly, I would like to express my profound gratitude to my
colleague, mentor, and friend, the late Sanjoy Mitter. Sanjoy's relentless
pushing of boundaries within academia and his unwavering commit-
ment to maintaining the highest standards were a guiding light through-
out this endeavor. Although he is no longer with us, his legacy continues
to shape the ethos of IDSS.
As my math-oriented colleagues often express, completing the
last epsilon (a small percentage) of a book takes one over epsilon time.
During my 2024 sabbatical, I had the privilege of being hosted by the
University of Mohammed VI Polytechnique for three months. Those
ﬁnal touches came to fruition primarily, thanks to the exceptional
environment provided by my Moroccan hosts Moustapha Terrab,
Mohamed Benkamoun, and Hicham Al Habti. I am profoundly grateful
for their remarkable generosity and hospitality.
And there Was Robert
During the pandemic, as I contemplated the idea of document-
ing the creation of IDSS, I felt compelled to organize my thoughts and
experiences into a coherent narrative. With Jennifer Kratochwill's

encouragement, I reached out to Robert Thurston-Lighty, whom I'd met
during the committee discussions about the establishment of the new
MIT Schwarzman College of Computing. We engaged in countless
conversations over the course of many weeks, and it was Robert's
insightful guidance that helped me shape my message and create a
comprehensive outline for this book.
Robert's contribution to this project has been nothing short of
remarkable. He possesses the unique ability to translate complex tech-
nical concepts from the academic realm into accessible language for a
broader audience interested in data science. He taught me the art of
engaging a diverse community and capturing their interest in delving
deeper into this ﬁeld. He provided crucial insights into maintaining
a balance between exploring less signiﬁcant details and focusing on the
most critical ideas - a valuable lesson that has enriched this endeavor.
The pandemic brought with it a sense of isolation, making
personal interactions a cherished rarity. Our biweekly meetings, involv-
ing Robert, Jennifer, and occasionally Kathleen Thurston-Lighty,
became bright spots in this otherwise challenging period. I cannot over-
state my gratitude to Robert for his unwavering dedication and invalu-
able contributions to this project. Without his guidance and support,
I may never have embarked on this journey.
Manuscript Feedback
I would like to express my gratitude to several individuals who
patiently reviewed earlier versions of this book and offered invaluable
feedback. I extend my thanks to colleagues and collaborators Fotini
Christia, John Tsitsiklis, and Devavrat Shah for their thoughtful com-
ments, particularly in validating the accuracy of the content and intro-
ducing additional perspectives. I also am indebted to Manon Revel for
her careful reading of the book. By approaching the material from the
perspective of an IDSS student, she provided insightful comments that
resonated well with what a new prospective data science student might
seek in the ﬁeld.
I am especially thankful for the extensive feedback received
from my daughter Deema, a data scientist at Google who provided a
practitioner's distinct perspective. Her written and oral feedback held
particular signiﬁcance as I experienced the role reversal of a father
beneﬁting from my daughter's constructive and incisive criticism.

Many thanks, as well, to Lauren Cowles, our editor at
Cambridge University Press. Her dedication to the ideas in this book
and to the polishing of the manuscript were essential to the fruition of
the project.
Special Thanks to My Family
In my family, the saga of this project has almost ascended into
the realm of a recurring joke. Whenever they've inquired about my
current endeavors, I'd unfailingly respond, "I'm in the ﬁnal stages of
completing my book." Often, I'd voice my concerns, questioning the
worth of a book that lacked intricate mathematical deﬁnitions and
equations. Thankfully, their steadfast encouragement and unwavering
support served as the driving force, propelling me forward during
moments of uncertainty and self-doubt. I want to extend my deepest
gratitude and boundless love to my wife, Jinane. In addition to her
unconditional support, Jinane was a partner and a consultant in the
creation of IDSS. Our inﬁnite discussions about the topics in this book
undoubtedly shaped my opinions - as well as what we ultimately
created at MIT. I also want to extend my deepest gratitude and uncon-
ditional love to my children, Deema, Hilal, and Yazeed, as well as my
nephew, Taher, for being there with unwavering support in every facet
of my life. My heartfelt thanks and love also go to my sister Diana for
her support and love and for being there for our family.
I owe my existence to my parents Wisam Abushaqra, who
passed away in 2024, and Abdullah Dahleh, who passed away in
2015. Their unwavering support and boundless love shaped the life
they provided for us, leaving an indelible mark on my thoughts and
actions. During my formative years, my late brother Mohammed was
the most inﬂuential ﬁgure in my life. Although he left us prematurely,
his memory continues to linger in my mind and heart. Every step I take
is accompanied by thoughts of how he might have perceived it.
I dedicate this book to the three of them.
