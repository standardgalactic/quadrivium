All right. Hello and welcome, everyone. It is Saturday, August 26, 2023. And we're here
in physics as information processing in the fourth discussion. Thank you, everybody who's
joining live or watching live or watching and replay. This should be a really fun discussion
as usual. So we're going to have under provide some slides and some initial clarifying questions
for Chris. And then we're going to open it up for our guests to ask some questions and
check in a live chat, see what people are talking about. So under to you for some slides and
overview. Okay, thank you, Daniel. So last time we were starting to talk about multi agent
communication and log protocols and all of that. So let's quickly go through the slides
and sort of try to recall the main concepts. So I guess from just to go back to session
three for a second, one takeaway was that when you have non-committing sectors in a boundary,
that's necessarily going to require classical communication between them. So that is more
or less the whole point of today how non-committing sectors may communicate, have to communicate
classically. Another introduction in this last lecture was this new graphical notation,
TQFT, if you wish to call it that way, for any of these clock ticks. So let's recall the whole
process of measuring a sector environment and writing it into a memory environment.
It can be simplified to this sort of tick that connects two portions of the boundary.
And everything we talk about log protocols will be written in this graphical notation.
So let's keep going a little bit. This slide is on the paper on sequential measurements from
2022. These are basically the formal mapping between QRFs and topological quantum field
theories. Okay, so we're more used to the picture here on the left-hand side of this slide,
with the QRF sectors. But pictorically speaking, this is at least how they map.
Okay, and then from then, we started talking about entanglement and classical communications
using this notation. And this is probably where my questions to Chris will start.
So in section three, we saw this idea of the FPP asymptotically being the principle of uniterity,
aka driving the system, the joint system, and Alice involved to entanglement,
which in graphical notation amounts to them sort of completing a cycle here,
where the QRFs are perfectly aligned so that the S sector of one becomes the memory sector
of the other, and vice versa. Now I actually, at this point already, I have a question for Chris.
I have it written down here. So yes, two things here, Chris. Number one is
in the log protocol picture, we do have a distinguishing between a quantum channel
and a classical channel. And if I understood that part correctly, we said that
passage of time or expenditure of energy, free energy only corresponds to the classical tick.
So in this quantum entanglement picture, where you don't quite have that, it's
referred to say that there's no such thing as a classical tick, no passage of time,
no expenditure of free energy. Is this a degenerate picture of the log protocol where
the sectors were aligned the right way? And boom, you got rid of that classical thing.
And that's it. And secondly, I guess it's what does it mean for these two parts,
quote unquote, from the paper, to implement the joint unitary process, the joint quantum process.
So yeah, this is not a log protocol, clearly, because there is no classical
communication. And in fact, Alice is not divided into multiple compartments here.
Alice is just implementing one, this single quantum process Q. And
because these sectors are, because these QRFs are perfectly aligned,
we can think of, remember,
from probably the second session, the picture that you were very interested in under
of the WIC rotation, reversing time between Alice and Bob. So Alice's clock, in fact,
ticks in the opposite direction from Bob's clock, because both of their internal clocks
are counting incoming bits, not outgoing bits. So in this, in the right side of this picture,
there is no overall time. You can think of Alice's clock ticking forward one unit,
and then Bob's clock ticking backward one unit, so that
the information flow is completely time symmetric between Alice and Bob. So we can think of
both of these processes, Q and Q prime, as bi-directional in time. That's what it means to
have a pure unitary process. So no time asymmetry, that's what it is? Right, so there is no time
asymmetry in this picture. And when you introduce classical communication, of course, you have
to have a time asymmetry, because you have this, I mean, classicality is defined by this notion
of irreversibility, which is just the same as time asymmetry. And it's the irreversibility that
burns energy. So there has to be energy flow between Alice and Bob to drive
what is in, from a global point of view, and only in apparent asymmetry, but from
the point of view of Alice one and Alice two as components of Alice. They're the ones who see
the asymmetry. So I guess just to tie back the question of the weak rotation, once this joint
process is implemented, I mean, and I think one can say, is this cycle going clockwise or counter
clockwise? And is that going to define on originally whenever these guys ended up being
lined up where the weak sign was coming from?
Yes, whenever Alice sees information flowing in, Bob sees information flowing out. So their
their their weak rotations are going in opposite directions.
Yeah, very good. And yeah, the other the other thing to to think of in this picture, Richards,
it's impossible to draw these simultaneously, is that if you if you think of the FEP
key as fully aligning Alice and Bob, then not only do these processes perfectly couple,
but the the area that's green in this right hand side kind of expands to fill the whole
boundary. So that in the in the complete limit of Alice being able to perfectly predict Bob and
vice versa, then the whole boundary is green. So that there's no this distinction between
the the the S sector and the Y sector disappears. Yes, yes, that makes sense, actually. And just
to conclude with this slide, back in the session two, we saw something about agents requiring a
free choice of reference frame for their QRFs, which amounts to being able to choose how to measure
spin, right? Right. So is part of this entanglement picture, like, do they do they just have to
align the sectors or all also the way they are measuring a spin on those sectors?
Yes, they they they have to align the way they're measuring the spin in those sectors that
it's that lack of remember the the point that free choice of of local reference frame
is required for separability. So as the systems become fully entangled,
then their local reference frames for each qubit become the same,
right, become necessarily the same.
Thank you. Okay, and then let's continue a little bit. So in this in this talk, we're mainly
interested on QRFs that do not commute. Now, maybe you can, because you can tie this back
to what you were saying earlier about if you're perfectly entangled, then the sector is going
to grow. Does it have anything to do with this? So if Q1 and Q2 here are do commute, then how does
how do you reduce this to the picture on the right hand side? At the first glance, it looks like
the picture on the left hand side encompasses more sectors of the boundary.
Yeah, the the point here is just that if if we go back and go go back to the notation where
what we're we're representing by this this simplified notation
is a collection of cone, cocoon diagrams.
And if the if the if these reference frames commute, then one can take these two diagrams
and and find a think of it in the information inflow direction.
There will always be a common
a co co cone over the two sets of input classifiers if the two QRFs commute.
So what that means is that I go from a diagram with two sets of classifiers each going up to some
apex to a diagram with the merge set of classifiers going up to some some farther up the hierarchy
apex. Because they commute, I can find that that sort of yet more abstract
cocoon that covers all of the classifiers in both QRFs. So that just collapses
of these pairs of green segments down to one green segment. And I've drawn it the same size,
I mean it would it would make more sense graphically I suppose to draw it. Each one is twice as big
or each one is twice the area. But yeah keeping to this kind of very topological representation
where the area isn't actually meaningful, it is convenient to draw it this way.
Right so so in short community the fact that they commute means that you will have that
higher apex anyway so you can bypass that first nesting. But it comes to the number of degrees
of freedom at the boundary they're still the same. I mean in terms of area. Yeah right yeah we're
not we're not getting rid of any of the degrees of freedom of the boundary that these QRFs are
looking at. Yeah very good. So the next slide I found a very interesting one. So these are
no-go theorems things that Alice and Bob cannot do and they measure you know it's mainly having to
do all that measuring. They're entangled and meant entropy and cutting degrees of freedom.
I guess this has a very holographic feel to it and also maybe even a bit of a gotal
theorem feel to it. So I don't know if Chris wants to comment on that.
Well I'll just say that I think this does have a kind of
girdle undecidability feel to it in that there there are a large number of questions that Alice
can't answer which certainly suggests a formulation in terms of incompleteness.
And this is the connection to girdle theorem is actually something that Jim Glaceburg and I are
currently working on and hopefully we'll be able to make that connection more precise.
But the the point of these statements is just to emphasize that
of a single observer that's uncompartimentalized cannot determine anything about the entanglement
entropy of the environment. And this is this is just the result that to to measure entanglement
you have to have you have to employ a lot protocol so you have to have classical communication.
And this raises a fundamental issue in the theory and that that classical communication
is an exchange of information that cannot be represented as a single quantum process you know
hence you have language like the collapse of the wave function or these various other
you know decoherence etc etc these various ways of trying to capture this idea that
something different and irreversible is happening as soon as you talk about classical communication.
So the point is for for Alice to measure anything about the entanglement entropy of Bob
she has to be sectored so her entanglement entropy
has to decrease but she can't know that she can't actually know that she has sectored
compartments when we think of Alice as an entire system. So from now on we're going to be talking
about the very limited points of view of particular observers and to to talk about that I think it's
it's very important to keep these various limitations in mind because there's a real
distinction between what we can say effectively
from this kind of God's eye point of view that we're adopting as theorists where we say
Alice has sectors that are communicating classically and what Alice a system can do
from her point of view or how her sectors can do from their points of view and this is a
distinction that's often ignored but it's important to keep it in mind.
Awesome, thank you for this line, Andrew. Yeah, so we continue?
Yeah, so then I guess we get to the the proper material of the last lecture which is
what happens when you have sectors that are not communicative such as two portions of Alice
involved that have to communicate classically. This is what requires the classical communication
tick. Let me see, so would it be fair to say Chris this only such a classical channel
which was the one shown in this slide requires free energy. Is that right because there's some
writing for a memory involved in here compared to the earlier slide where we had that closed
loop in the entire angle picture. There was no expenditure of energy, is that correct?
Right, right, so here the the example that came to mind here is
exactly the process that we're executing right now.
Alice has two components and we are currently in the position of those components
and we're communicating classically with each other by employing a channel that's part of our
shared environment. So we're acting irreversibly on our shared environment and it's that irreversible
action on the environment that has the free energy cost for each of us.
We actually have to make noise to communicate and our laptops are actually consuming power.
All of this is classical. I mean it's this irreversible irreversibility that defines
classicality. Right, and to continue with this question I guess it will come in sure in later
slides but the other side of this local protocol is the quantum channel and my question to you
Chris is just like there is an expenditure of time and energy involved in this classical channel
is the quantum channel basically the opposite of that meaning its action is instantaneous
entanglement presumably and also again back to that loop picture of entangled cycle
is there just no passage of time, no expenditure of energy, does that any of that make sense?
Yeah and I think it's worth actually going to the next slide here where we complete the loop
and add the quantum channel. Is it this one? Yeah I think to understand what's going on here
I think it's very useful to think of it in terms of a LEPR experiment
right where Bob in this case the shared environment includes the source that's creating the entangled
pair which A1 and A2 observe simultaneously they interact simultaneously with
their two detectors which are interacting with the entangled pair so you can think of their
two detectors are entangled and it's only later that they exchange this classical information
and in a LEPR experiment the time the elapsed time between the source emitting the entangled pair
and the entangled pair interacting with
the detectors deployed by A1 and A2
is designed as part of the experimental protocol to be less than the time that it is required
for A1 and A2 to communicate classically and notice that from the point of view of the entangled
pair itself no time has passed at all right it's the entangled pair is from a special
relativity point of view moving along a light light trajectory so there's no distance being
traversed and no time is elapsing from the point of view of the entangled pair there's only an elapsed
time and a traverse distance in the coordinates of the observers
and it's those coordinates that define the parameters for the observers eventual classical
communication so that's this is why i characterize the the assumption of classical communication
is a stipulation and also why i characterized it as a fine-tuning assumption right we're
we're assuming something very specific about this communication channel
and we're assuming that the the part of bob the part of the shared environment
that implements this classical communication channel behaves differently from the rest of
the shared environment it behaves in a way that is is classical but the rest of the shared
environment doesn't right the rest of the world is is described using quantum theory
so we're we're making this assumption that part of the shared environment is special
and the the specialness is that it it behaves in this classical way
so let me let me finish with this slide i suppose uh to go back to my earlier question about that
entangled loop being at least pictorically appears to be like a degenerate version of this log picture
if in this log picture i have the quantum channel on the right uh that hypothetical entanglement
on the to complete the cycle on the left was only broken when a1 and a2 chose to write
that into their memories at different sectors right and then that eventually necessitated
the classical communication between them is that is that correct
yeah you know one could one could always take the point of view of if you will the observer
who's outside the entire universe and just sees the entire universe evolving uniterally
and in from that point of view there's no such thing as classical communication
so the communication is classical only only relative to this division between the observers
and that division between the observers corresponds to their their measurement procedures not
commuting so it corresponds to what we think of classically as Alice acting on her half of the
entangled state uh determining what Bob will then see again that's that all of that causal language
is classical right right uh and we're like 11 30 so halfway more let's let's say a few words on
uh the the later flight that's uh it's got a profit and all of that um
i guess before we before we start talking about this which will take us like
five to ten minutes at most did you say if you a few words again about the fine tuning assumption so
uh i still won't quite understand what is meant here that this whole classical communication
stuff requires fine tuning
okay i i think a a way to think about it is uh to to think about what it means to say that Alice
and Bob are able to communicate classically um what we're saying is that Alice and Bob
share some sort of language so when they exchange their data we can think of their
data as as written in some binary code in a data table you know Alice says
uh i i set my instrument this way and i saw this spin i i then set my instrument this other way
and i i made this observation so Alice's data table or a one's data table
uh is is just a a long table with two entries in each row uh one entry is how the detector
was adjusted and the other entry is is what the value of the spin was observed
and Bob's data table looks the same and so they they share this information or they share it with
some third party they they communicate it classically and there are two aspects to that
classical communication one is that up to classical noise of their data tables don't change
when they share them so they really are irreversibly recorded they're not evolving in time
uh along with the rest of the universe the other aspect is that we have to assume that
Alice and Bob mean the same thing by their their notations in these data tables so that
they can actually compare them so that they can actually do the statistics and see if they've
violated Bell's inequality so what that means is we have to assume that they actually share
a definition of up and that when they talk about changing the settings on their instruments
they're talking about changing those settings with respect to some shared definition of up
and you know in a in a real experiment that shared definition of up is provided by the
the earth's gravitational field or something like that earth's magnetic field some shared
environmental variable so now it seems like we have a situation in which Alice Alice 1 and Alice 2
should be entangled right because they share this reference frame that enables them to communicate
classically but they can't be entangled if they're going to communicate classically
so so we make an assumption that in just this case they share a reference frame but they're
not entangled they're able they're able to communicate classically while sharing the
reference frame and we can sort of wave our hands and say they only share the reference frame up to
some measurement resolution or something like that but despite the hand waving we're making a very
specific assumption that violates the fact that reference frame sharing induces entanglement
so that's the fine-tuning assumption we assume that the universe is such that in this very specific
kind of case we can have reference frame sharing without entanglement
cool okay let's let's keep it here and just open it up a little bit if um Harris or Dean
want to just give any thought or reflection on what we've gotten to so far
Harris if you want to please yes everything is very interesting
basically I was listening with great let's say focus it reminded me this let's say
elaboration on the previous talk that Chris gave two weeks ago it reminded me something
that Michael Levitt said some time ago it is regarding this amazing ability of cognition
to scale up so it's not only this understanding let's say of the scattering of cognition but
also the scaling up of cognition and when I tried to get inside my head actually that
asked Chris said in in in one of his talks that if a system is a toggle one cannot draw a meaningful
boundary across it so these fine fine tuning let's say elaboration that was made
right now actually helps me understand that even better so thank you Chris for that and thank you
under for this elaboration
well thank you thank you I'm glad that helped
yeah I I think this is intimately related to the question of what cognition is
since if if we have a if we have a purely quantum system there there really is a deep
sense in which nothing is happening because of the time symmetry so to talk about cognition
is something that actually occurs we have to think of it classically
thank you also if you allow me another comment on that basically one of the comments posted
during your last talk in the chat had to do with classical memories and I was thinking about that
and I came to the conclusion that classical memories presupposes a gestation period
and and when I think about it that actually makes sense and it is true let's say
for for both physical and psychological reasons so for example a hard disk needs to write data on
its magnetic surface and a human brain needs to consolidate all those neural connections through
synaptic plasticity let's say however when we start thinking about
quantum quantum information and quantum quantum memories let's say we realize that
such memories will be will such quantum memories basically will be stored in qubits
or in those entangled states that you described so they do not necessarily have the same limitations
and of course quantum information theorists suggest as I understand it that quantum memories
can be created and accessed instantaneously without any form of gestation let's say without any
and gestation period and of course this goes back and it has the potential as I see to revolutionize
computation with in terms of quantum computing computation but also and most importantly
communication and quantum cryptography even and this is something that I am truly interested in
and so yeah I just wanted to shout or saw that
yeah that's that's a very good point and the the flip side is
the the issue of stability which again gets to the notion of of environmental decoherence
which is just the process of observation of the quantum state by
some environment or some observer some component of its environment
and the reason this is a problem in practice is that we don't have complete control of all
components of the environment right so we have to use things like liquid helium
to try to keep the environment at bay to prevent decoherence because any other components of the
environment interacting with our quantum memory will alter the state of the memory
yeah that is that is a great and great answer and basically the reason why I type that question
regarding super selection rules and namely I propose something called fuzzy super selection rules
basically as I understand it those super selection rules the classical ones let's say
they are based on symmetries or on all those conversation laws that actually limit the
accessibility or the our capacity to to measure let's say certain quantum properties let's say
maybe it's parity maybe it's angular momentum maybe it's even charged but if we if we start
thinking like these fuzzy super selection rules in an effort to relax these restrictions
by allowing some degree of coherence or interference between the different super selected sectors
which can be quantified let's say by a parameter called fuzziness I know that in other fields like
in my field that is fuzzy cognitive mapping the introduction of fuzziness from us as it was
propounded by professor Lotfi Zadek it actually helped a lot of our models to become more accurate
let's say so this is what I am proposing maybe of course I don't expect it to
revolutionize quantum information but maybe it can help us understand a bit better what
is going on in the role of these the coherence that comes out of the environment so if we
incorporate it as a parameter of fuzziness a priori then maybe we can understand then even
what we are dealing with
yeah I would refer you to the paper by Bartlett
who are the other there are two other co-authors in 2007 a lovely review of quantum reference
frames in reviews of modern physics and a point that they make that I think is relevant here
is that a super selection rule can always be interpreted let me see if I if I I'm not sure
I'll be able to completely reproduce their argument but they showed that a super selection rule
can always be interpreted as the absence of a reference frame or the the lack of a reference
frame and one of the examples that they give is charge conservation that we never see
super positions of different electric charges and their point is we never see this because we
have no way of measuring it we have no reference frame that we could use that would allow us to
see a state of superposed charges and effectively what they're saying is our reference frames are
all made of matter that is composed of stuff that has well-defined electric charges
so we can't we can't see things that are super positions of charge and it's very difficult
you know for us to see things that are super positions of position
so this question of what is a super selection rule why do we have these rules
at least in their reasoning boils down to the question of why do we have some
reference frames or some measurement capabilities and not others what is it about us
that limits in some fundamental way our ability to make measurements and
I suspect that when you talk about buzziness which is a sense of classical uncertainty
that you may be sort of pointing in that direction but I think it would be worth looking at that
paper and which is which is largely written in English right the the formalism is kept in the
background so it's a it's a very nice paper
you thank you we should get out for sure thank you um enter maybe mute a little bit
Dean on the mountaintop what can you throw down on us
I don't have anything I don't have anything super special throw down I have a I have a question
though and because I am very comfortable in that fuzzy space I kind of see relationships as
and their and their lack of definability as a feature so here's my here's kind of my question
um so you talked about a minimum sort of two different memories to encode something
in time and I think it's it was one of the slides just after the one that's up here right now
which sounds to me like somewhere processing capacity it sounds like we are kind of stepping
back and trying to look at this instantaneous thing from the relative position of even the
things that are classical can be seen as all quantum so that when you mentioned that earlier
Chris that helped me quite a bit which then manifests itself as a classical ability to
process somewhere I I spent a lot of my career self labeling as a wayfinder so not capacity
realization relationship just as a relationship it means that wayfinding is not just an
orienting or a processing where I am and being gripped by the sort of the thing I'm enveloped by
it's also the channel the screen the bound the divide the gap the unentangled potentiator
it's the thing upon which traction can exist as being a gripper as well so if it's I was already
hung up on I wanted to go back like Colombo in that old 70s tv show and talk about z-spin because
I think z-spin is an energy way of describing but I honestly think when I went back and watched the
your presentation a couple of times I'm starting to get a sense that z-spin is also a relationship
it's that affordance that allows us to be able to see up and down but I'm just curious Chris
are we really talking about processing somewhere in the classical sense but because we have
these two ways of encoding different memories we're also talking about somewhere processing
just that that state that allows for that that's my my question is that what we're
really getting are we are we trying to open that up that possibility up
yeah I think that's a nice way to think about it
I think we're trying to at some deep level
come up with a way of describing what it means to be an agent
and I'll say in our case a self-conscious agent
with a sense of time that's embedded in an environment that we depend on to store memories
for us and what I what I mean by that is that we we depend on the environment to change very
slowly at least from our point of view so that we can keep some sense of our orientation within
the environment right we're using everything we see as a memory that allows us to keep our
ourselves fixed which allows us to have a point of view so we're we're using the entire visible
environment as if you will a reference frame against which we can see small changes
but if the environment was constantly change constantly and rapidly changing
we wouldn't be able to do that and we wouldn't be able to use it as a memory and so we would
have no point of view so in a sense I think what we're talking about here is the
kind of the the miracle of having a point of view that gives us a sense of time
that's very philosophical but
it's it's amazing and I wonder if along with the
perspectival visual advancements which you and Shana Dobson have explored in the math art settings
you're almost bringing that kind of a transformative re-understanding or re-quantum
reference framing into a temporal setting where it's not just a static spatial parallax
that we are aesthetically and formally re-understanding but also a temporal one
which in an agent environment system necessitates these questions of communication
which in the quantum information formalism are approached topologically rather than
geometrically which is what we needed for the kind of vanishing point type math art in the spatial setting
well I think they're they're approached geometrically eventually and and that's really what the
session in September will be about it's how to how to start with this very topological picture
where we're only talking about
interactions of in a sense interactions in time but but outside of space
and layer a spatial structure on top of that and this is
I think this is particularly interesting in this active inference context because it
immediately raises biological questions about
the ability of different organisms to layer space on their experience and hence locate themselves
if you will within some sort of perceived world
awesome Dean and then back to Anders last minutes
oh wait I'm mute Dean and then please continue
sorry so Chris is it from from the pure neophyte perspective that I have is it okay to say
that it's not just a flipping of of position of words that somewhere processing that availability
and processing somewhere in the classical sense where am I it's the it's our ability
to fuse those as you mentioned we can we can slow down we can stabilize we can see
that relationship or is it about spin
I think the former writes spin is a very convenient abstraction for talking about
binary encoding
and we have this felt sense of spin but the the sense it's its use in physics is very much an
abstraction I mean the difference between a proton and neutron is a spin variable
awesome under you can in the last minutes take it where you need
also I'm mute and then continue can you guys hear me now well so let's hope that I have a
time for Chris to address a couple things so just to conclude the slides
and then hopefully we get to say a few words on quantum Darwinism so the towards the end the slides
appear to start pivoting towards the next subject which is space and time and here in
particular we see the earlier slide showcasing the log protocol where you can you can you can
notice that half of it has been cut and has has been moved to the future so here we don't have
two sectors of Alice communicating but rather Alice communicating with its future
still you have the classical and the quantum channel now one question that I brought up I remember
and in in the lecture and maybe we can expand on a little more was exactly what is the difference
in this quantum and the classical channel part something I heard Chris say is that it is crucial
for the quantum channel to be to here so this is going to be some sort of unitary scattering
evolution that is completely independent of everything else going on is that correct or
should be in theory and yes yeah and and I suppose just like earlier the classical the
classical channel is is the part that takes time and free energy expenditure now my question
to you Chris is on not not not the not the channels in the middle but the ticks on either
side of the boundaries that have been broken down and separated in terms of an external time
what's what's up with those ticks from one sector to the other of the boundary
so in q1 for example the low the lower qrf sector that's that amount to a state was prepared
the upper one was I made a memory record of that state is that that's what it is right
yeah okay so in the lower sector we both had a preparation and a measurement and a measurement
was recorded classically here that's all there is yeah so so preparation and measurement are
effectively the same process and you can think of in a1 of t what a1 is doing is
from an operational point of view she's preparing an instrument
and turning it on she's she's creating an initial state
and she's simultaneously encoding a memory someplace
in her head or on a piece of paper of what those preparation conditions were
because it's only with respect to the memory of what the preparation conditions were
that the later measurement is meaningful so
let's let's go back to just preparing a spin
right and at t she may
set the angle of some polarization filter that defines a propagating beam of photons
and at t plus delta t she measures something about what those photons are doing but the
measurement is only meaningful with respect to her memory of what the polarization setting that
prepared the photons was so the effectively what's going on in the quantum channel is an experiment
and it's it's the the classical information that's preserved in this classical channel that
makes the experiment meaningful or interpretable or informative yeah for sure yeah that makes
perfect sense and in preparation of measurement this ties back to an earlier question we had
both happen simultaneously at the same like degree of freedom at the boundary or do we have
preparation at the lower bounds at the top of one yeah one one can one can think of that operator
mi if you remember the decomposition of the Hamiltonian as as preparing or measuring that
it's just a matter of interpretation uh you know effectively is it acting to the left or acting to
the right yeah okay yeah yeah yeah makes perfect and then before we get to quantum error correction as
more of a spatial analysis instead of a time thing I wanted to ask a yet another question
between this one and my classical so the quantum channels that involves some sort of
time evolution you know it's this unitary you know portion that is
sorry this portion that is evolving unitary with no interference from the outside
however as you said for this experiment to make sense you need to have a classical memory
of how that experiment was most prepared so that's that mean that that classical guy on top
is static there's no time flowing in well this actually gets back to the talk by
susan that we were talking about before we started here that you kindly referred me to
part of part of this classical memory is our memory for what counts as a classical clock
and we'll actually get to this again in the september session but if you if you think again
about doing an experiment in which a state is prepared and then it's measured this quantum
process is a process through time with respect to some classical clock that actually provides
the time coordinate for the experiment so this this classical clock is some external
reference frame that that a1 here in this notation is is using as part of her classical memory
right again it's a memory because it's something that's assumed not to change
and and this is this will be kind of the heart of the discussion in september that
that time and memory and object persistence are all different names for the same assumption
that we make about the world thank you chris thank you i i am gonna have to disappear so
only for now though yeah only for now i will i will nonetheless persist someplace
thank you chris so much chris okay awesome see y'all thanks very much well measure you later
um ender if you wanted to drop any other cues or clues or bring us a little bit of a preparation
for where we're going to be heading in lecture five that would be pretty cool
sure so i mean i i'm a little aware of what's coming in lecture five um it's about space and time
and how space may be sorry time may be a little more fundamental than space for reasons that chris
will show um has a lot to do with the notion of how you define a clock i see and we need to think
hard about what what what are the bare minimum ingredients for you to talk about the existence
of a clock uh these are deep fundamental almost philosophical questions that are overlooked
and the good news and that's the saskin talk that chris and i were referring to referring to
is that other people especially in the high energy community are also looking into these
questions which is very reassuring so i'm talking about edwinton saskin harlow etc they are there's
a recent talk on on youtube where they talk about what does it mean for something to be a clock
you know how this how long does the clock last and and then chris will also talk about space
and and the punchline of it will be that um there's obviously a physics approach to
emergent space time which is very very technical and and so on but from what i understood i mean i
have yet to see the talk my first my first myself first um is that there is a parallel biological
approach as to how we learn our space time so from a developmental psychology point of view
influence and i suppose all kinds of animals are not born fully equipped to perceive space time
hence the necessity of things like clay and so on so they can find correlations between
motor inputs and visual inputs right and eventually things like the mirror test
which is non-trivial no no no no no human born is born uh passing the mirror test already
so that implies that at least biologically it is non-trivial and it takes a few steps until
you get to have that sort of space spatial awareness right now the interesting part of this
for me personally is what the what the physics side of it is and uh i i'm i'm no expert by any
means but i think the gist of it might might have to do something with quantum error correction
adseft and so on um there was a bit of a teaser about quantum error correction here
in these slides uh but yeah i mean that's that's about all i can say but very looking forward to
the biology also yeah cool harris any last thoughts or anything you want to point towards
basically i would like to thank everyone for inviting me i really enjoyed it
the whole uh um uh live stream uh i hope uh we have made some progress and uh looking forward to
the next uh uh live streams number five and number six so uh that's about it thank you everyone
thank you anything else under that's it awesome well i encourage everyone to go to the syllabus
page look ahead look back pre-gest digest re-gest ask questions and let's make progress as you
exhort harris so see y'all till next time
you
