So I'm going to tell you about our research on Hydra, Hydra Regeneration, and I guess most of you are familiar with Regeneration by the work on Planaria, but what I've been doing for the last few years is using electric field,
different kinds of electric fields to control Hydra Regeneration, and my interest is mainly in the physics of the problem, in the physics of morphogenesis, trying to construct a framework to understand the process of morphogenesis in general,
but concentrating on the context of Hydra Regeneration, and what I'll try to do is to walk you through some of our research starting from electric field effect on Regeneration,
and then what we concentrate more recently is on the role of noise in morphogenesis, so I hope we'll go through the entire story. I'll try to give you a comprehensive view more or less of what we are doing,
but there are many side branches and technical things, so I'll try to avoid technicalities, but if there are any questions please ask, I'll be happy to answer.
So also this is Hydra, I don't know how much you're familiar with, I'll come back to it in a second, but we are interested in morphogenesis in general, which is a pattern formation process, and especially the question that is behind my research is trying to understand the dynamics of the process, the dynamical framework that allows or ensures the robustness
of the emergence of a body form in morphogenesis, and of course whatever I'm going to show you is impossible to do on mice or whatever, so we choose a model system which is much simpler, this is the Hydra,
and I think it's fair to say that the physical mechanism that drives morphogenesis are poorly understood, this is in contrast to a lot of progress in molecular and cellular biology underlying developmental processes,
the physics of the process is much less understood, and this is the aim of my research, I try to advance this, the core physics is very general, so it's not only mechanics as you will see, there are many other aspects that come to it,
and as I said at the beginning, mainly the role of fluctuations and noise that underlie morphogenesis, so morphogenesis is a process that emerges from the interaction of three types of fields or processes,
not just specific but three types I would say, these are biochemical processes, signaling and everything else that is biochemical, mechanical processes, these are essentially in order to form the shape of the body and the three-dimensional adhesion, folding and etc.
that lead to the body form of an animal, and electrical processes that I don't need to convince your group that is important, and electrical processes appear as you know in every aspect, actually in biology,
so, and this is, these two everybody will agree, this one I'm not sure that it's a common, how much is a common knowledge for your group, it's certainly well understood,
but the point is that these fields need to evolve simultaneously as coupled field, so mechanics will not work independent of electrical, biosignaling will not come independent of mechanics, they are all coupled in a way that they feed each other and they need
enough symbiosis and integration to work as a coordinated process towards, you know, a viable organism at the end, so IDRA, I don't know if it's familiar to everybody, I can skip, but anyway, IDRA is a multicellular
pedator, it's a behaving animal if you want, which is a very simple geometry, it has something like 100,000 cells with more than 10 cell types, it has a nerve system that is distributed, there is no brain, but they are distributed
nerves, nerve cells that are connected to each other and to the rest of the system, it has tentacles to catch prey, and a side that is as a mouse, and a side that has a food that can attach to surfaces, it's a single body axis with radial symmetry,
well it has a lot of advantages from my side trying to understand the physics of the problem, it's very flexible to initial and boundary conditions, we can torture IDRA by many many different way and it will survive and regenerate,
it allows control of the dynamics, this is something that is unusual, it's also perturbing the dynamics, changing it, I'll show you that we can really control it, I mean we can stop it, we can reverse it, we can move it to different points,
and this is not very common in these studies of developmental systems, and the dynamics is really robust, and it allows long term measurements and statistical view which is essential as it will go along,
so this is IDRA, it has a very interesting history which I'm not going to elaborate on, this is Abraham Tremblay that he didn't discover IDRA, IDRA was discovered by Levenouk that invented the microscope,
but he was the first one that discovered regeneration and he published this beautiful book which I really recommend for every experimentalist to read, so his experiments on IDRA, he was a mathematician by the way, a Swiss mathematician, this is a real picture that was drawn by his friend,
these are two kids of the Duke of Hague, this is inaugural teaching them, and he found IDRA in the ponds around and he cut them and started to look and discover regeneration,
and this is considered as the birth of experimental biology, this is middle 18th century, and the reason it's birth of experimental biology because, and this is the essence of this memoirs, four memoirs,
in this book, that he told people how to do experiments in biology, before that people were only naturalists, looking around etc, he did real experiments and discussed what is a control, how to write a lab book,
all the details that we, you know, for us is obvious, but this was the beginning, and what is discovered is this, is this regeneration that you are all familiar in IDRA, there are three modes if you want to run regeneration experiment, you can cut the animal into two parts and get back the other half that is missing,
you can cut a tissue, with a minimal size of say 1000 cells or around a few hundred cells, it falls into a hollow spheroid, which will come back to it, it's important, it's a, it has to close into a spheroid, if it doesn't close to a spheroid there is no regeneration,
and then within a day or two you get the entire animal back, or you can put it in a blender, dissociate the cells, aggregate them together in a centrifuge, and get again a hollow spheroid and the animal, again within timescale of days,
so I think this, this makes, this mode makes the Hydra, the world champion in regeneration, because to take dissociated cells and get the animal back is something really unusual, I mean all body regeneration is also rare among, you know, the animal kingdom, but this is really unusual,
so in our lab experiments we use this mode, because this takes more effort and to get many samples it's hard, and I didn't find any advantage, if you want to understand this process going from the spheroid to the entire animal, it's much easier to start from tissue fragments of any geometry, you can invent all kind of geometries,
and this is how it looks in the lab, you take a fragment, this is the hollow spheroid, this is time in hours, and you get the entire animal, probably you saw this before, but this is how it looks like under our microscope,
so the scale here is, we start from a few hundred microns, spheroid, and if you take small tissue sample, you get small animal, you take larger, you take, it's really gradual,
okay, so you can decide what size you're interested in, study things as a function of size also, so the hydra body is made out of bilayer epithelial tissues, ectoderm and endoderm,
and other types of cell in between, I'm not going to discuss this in detail, what is special about this epithelial system is the fact that these are muscles, so these epithelial cells are also muscles,
and these are the actin fibers, supercellular actin, there are two types of actin, one that supports the skeleton of a cell itself, but they're also supercellular actin fibers,
these ones run along the, this is in the ectoderm, they run along the animal, along the axis, this is one animal, we just cut it, get a good imaging of every part,
so it goes all the way, these are the tentacles, and in the endoderm, in the inside part, you have the orthogonal supercellular fibers, so there are two fiber muscles that are orthogonal to each other,
and allows all the movement, contraction, expansion, etc. of the animal, so this is the basic, one last thing about hydra that will become important momentarily is that it's a freshwater animal,
and because it's a freshwater animal, it has to balance osmotic pressure gradients, because the osmolarity, the ionic concentrations inside the cells need to be much larger than the environment, the environment is one millimolar of ions and this requires much larger,
so it builds a cavity, that's why the hollow spheroid is really essential, because it's a reservoir of ions that support the animal, it works also as an idostatic skeleton for the animal, but these are more or less the ratios of osmolarity,
so it's very low outside, it's a physiological concentration inside, and in the middle osmolarity in the cavity itself, so water can flow in, you can see this is the area of this spheroid during regeneration, many times it shows this sotus trajectory,
where it inflates because water comes in, and then it releases the pressure by tearing the tissue, and there are two mechanical forces then that determine the shape of the tissue and the animal at the end,
this is idostatic pressure by this fluid that is incompressible inside the cavity, that is modulated by osmotic pressure gradients that allow water to flow in and out,
and the contractile actomyosine internal forces, these are the muscles, and the balance of these two determines the shape of the body form, of the tissue form, and then again what morphology can be deformed during morphogenesis,
okay, so what I'm going to tell you is four sections, I'll do them, they're not balanced, I'll see how much of interest you have in this,
I'll first discuss hydro regeneration under an electric field, I'll do it relatively briefly just to give you the taste, what we can do is electric field, external electric field, and now we can control regeneration,
and then there are three parts that are important, one is discuss calcium and calcium fluctuations in the tissue, and it turns out because one of the important forces are the internal actomyosine for generation, this actomyosine needs calcium to operate as usual in every muscle,
and some of the effort went to understand the calcium field in the tissue during regeneration and the fluctuations, and I'll tell you about this, and then this is more going into the physics part, I'm not going to drop on you fancy physics,
I'll just try to demonstrate that morphogenesis is kind of phase transition, it's a dynamical phase transition, not thermodynamic phase transition, and we'll discuss the dynamics and the model that I think represent well the main physical
processes that lead to the morphological transition during regeneration, and then the ideas that come from here and the experimental validation of these ideas show that fluctuations are important, fluctuations in morphology,
and this brings me to the last part, which is the role of noise in morphogenesis and the phenomena that is called stochastic resonance that is known in physical systems, but now we can demonstrate it on the entire animal in the context of morphogenesis,
and these three parts were done in tight collaboration with this guy, who is a physicist from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem,
okay, and please stop me and ask questions if there are things, so the first thing I would like to discuss is either morphogenesis or regeneration under external fields and show you that we can control the regeneration,
and this summarizes the process, so we cut a fragment from a mature hydra, a small fragment, it falls into a spheroid, and then the tissue is set between a pair of electrodes,
we have many samples, each one, I don't have the setup, I forgot to put the slide, there are two electrodes covering each tissue sample, in an experiment we have something like 15,
and the multiplexer system that we build, so we can put different voltages and different frequencies, AC frequencies on each pair of electrodes, so we can scan parameters and stuff,
but what I'm going to show you is even simpler than that, and what we discovered a few years ago is that there is a critical voltage, actually it's a critical field, but the distance between electrodes is fixed, so field and voltage is the same in that case,
so there is a critical electric field that if you apply it, you can stop regeneration, actually you can stop it at different stages, so it remains a spheroid, and then you release it, you release the voltage, drop it back to zero, and it regenerates, I'll show you a moving second,
so this is one mode of control, the other mode of control which is much more surprising is that you take an animal or regenerated animal, you apply a voltage above critical, it's not the same number, it's not the same critical value,
but there is a critical field above which the animal falls back into a spheroid, it takes the tentacles in, it falls everything, and it goes back, and then once you release it, release the voltage, it regenerates again,
and so you can do cycles here, back and forth, let it develop going back, let it develop going back, so these are some pictures, here we stop regeneration at this voltage, then we release it, it starts to regenerate, here it's an animal, it falls back, then we release it, you can run it fast,
so here we stop regeneration, we let the voltage drop to zero, it regenerates, we put higher voltage on it, it goes back, release the voltage, and it regenerates, okay, so you can go back and forth,
and doing a lot of experiments we check that for example this animal after a few times of regeneration going back can go mature, can for example feed itself, can get buds out, et cetera, so it's really a reversible non-destructive process that goes back and forth,
okay, and the numbers are important but it might, there is a lot of variability between tissue samples, et cetera, so there are no exact numbers for critical voltage,
but what is clear is that there is a kind of adaptation if you want, that if you do a round like that and then you go to a second round, you need to increase the voltage a little bit, the animal becomes a little bit adept, but not much, I mean, so gradually you have to increase the voltage applied to the system,
and then the question is whether it's just on morphology, this is a big question for a big lab, I'm not a big lab, I'm very small, so what we try to do is to look on the most significant easy to look signature which is the head organizer in IDRA, head organizer in IDRA,
also it's an interesting history, but before this guy, Speeman and this graduate student, Mangold, found and developed the concept of organizers, which is important in many animals, including mammals,
Ethel Brown, in the beginning of the 20th century, did experiments on IDRA and found the process of induction, so you take a head, you take a piece of it, you plug it somewhere else, and you get another head growing from the IDRA, so it can induce,
and the essence of organizer, it's a polarity, so it's a signaling center for the tip of the head in IDRA, it's really in the tip, as you see here, and the molecular biology is more or less understood in IDRA, which I'm not going to get into,
but for us, what we did, we used a strain that has a marker for the operation of this gene, Win3, and what you see here, this is just a fluorescence marker over the body to see that we are not losing the signal because we are losing fluorescence,
from the movie, it's hard to see, but under a field, the signal goes away, and then it comes back, I'll show you the pictures, it's much better,
maybe, I don't know, the movie is not great, but anyway, let's see if I can,
you see the signal coming back after dropping, you see it already,
anyway, this is the measurement, a few samples, so the fluorescence goes down under the field, and then it gradually comes back when you set the field back to zero,
and there is a time scale for this process, but this is just a demonstration that there is hope that the field, the electric field is affecting processes not only in morphology, but also in the signaling system,
so this is part of research that we still need to work out, and how deep it goes into, for example, converting differentiated cells back into stem cells, etc., it's a big, big question,
so if you can show, for example, that the external electric field can drive back differentiated cells into stem cells, this will be very significant,
discovery, we are not there yet, so I don't know if this really happens, this is a summary for the electric field, so there is a cut off, so you can go all the way down to DC,
but this is a terrible regime to work because it changes the pH of the medium and the electrodes are coated with all kinds of contamination,
by the way, all the experiments are done in flow, so the medium is replaced all the time, it's not to keep the conditions constant, but using AC field there is a cut off at 3 kHz,
and this cut off comes from the RC time constant of the tissue, so above 3 kHz if you can put zillion volts and the system becomes completely transparent,
the field goes through without affecting anything, and this is because of the filtering, the RC filtering of the tissue, so morphogenesis is certainly reversible,
at least from the morphology, there are some signs also from the signaling, but it's reversible in a non-destructive way, so the regeneration potential is still very much in operation in all these tissues that go back and forth,
the record, by the way, is 5 times, I could go 5 times back and forth between fully developed and back to a spheroid,
and after that, because there is no energy supply, just in one millimolar of water, it's mineral water if you want, then it loses energy and loses some cells and I couldn't go beyond 5 times, 5 times is a lot because it goes, develop, go back, develop, go back,
and these are also, comes very long experiments because I want to see that it develops, fully develop, so it's weeks of experiments on the same samples,
and one interesting discovery is that when you go backward and forward, you get many times different body planes, body forms, so it's not, it can start to,
as if there are alternative trajectories in development and you fold it back, it starts a different trajectory, for example it can go, if by accident I get two heads, I draw with two heads, I fold it back, I get it back with one head,
if I get a head draw with two tentacles, I fold it better, I get five tentacles with a shape that is not exactly, so there are some signs that there are many alternative trajectories to regeneration, it's not,
certainly not just going back and forth along the same trajectory, the calcium which will come back to it momentarily is highly intensified by the field,
but by the way, the reason, the field, the reason a few tents of volts, 20 volts, 30 volts can do all this effect is because there is a natural amplifier in the hydro tissue,
which is highly non-linear, right, because it's a muscle, so all the epithelium is electrically excitable, like any muscle system,
and that's the reason I thought from the beginning that using an external electric field that at low level might excite the system into interesting trajectories,
because the system itself needs to be triggered, you don't need to penetrate the system and do all kinds of things,
by itself it starts to propagate electrical activity that is not the regular one, and this is manifested also in the intensified calcium activity which reflects the electrical excitations in the tissue,
again there is a decay of the head organizer, that's for sure, how far it goes beyond this I don't know,
and clearly the calcium activity is a very important ingredient, a very important field that drives morphogenesis in hydro,
okay, and I think in many other systems as well, but that's for discussion, there are interesting implications for all these gymnastics,
certainly one needs to consider morphogenesis beyond biochemical patterning, there's no news for you,
and it suggests that morphogenesis is a dynamical process that we need to understand, that's something I would like to do,
is to try to understand it as a dynamical pattern forming system rather than just a collection of molecular processes that lead to the organism,
this is again not news for you, electrical processes play an instructive role to the level that can direct the developmental process,
and the question whether developmental processes are fully reversible is a big question,
but even if some of them are reversible, it should lead to some modification in our perspective what development means,
because usually the conventional picture of if you open any book on development, it looks as if it's an hierarchical process that crosses thresholds,
and that's it, it goes one way, and then of course people were surprised to find out that you can do reprogramming of cells,
but the question whether you can do reprogramming of animals, it's a big question, I'm not saying that I can take a mouse and going back to the egg,
but whether it's the real picture or the concept behind development is crossing threshold in hierarchical way is the right picture,
I put a question mark on this, because it might be part of the story, it might be completely wrong, I don't know, but that's the issue.
Can I ask a question?
Sure, but you have to speak louder or I should, yes.
Are you, is this okay? Is this loud enough?
Yeah, so does the alignment of the hydro with respect to the electrodes matter at all?
No.
If you, no?
No, that's why I started with this here, I was hoping that I can direct the process, but I couldn't find any effect of the direction of the electrodes,
and even more important, we did a lot of work with Kenared Keran in our department on the acting system, on the supercellular acting fibers,
I was hoping that I could affect their orientation or even melt the order in some regions by the electric field.
They don't seem to have any kind of polarity that is sensitive to the direction of the field, or even to the, if it's in DC, to the polarity of the field itself.
The reason it got me thinking is the alternating electric field induces a magnetic field also, right? And so the two fields are orthogonal, and then you also have the acting fibers that are also.
No, no, no, magnetic field is very low here. In another set of experiments, I turned the hydra into magnetic hydra.
I coated it with magnetic beads, and then using magnetic probes, you can apply local mechanical deformations, but while doing this, I put an electric field on the hydra, I didn't see any effect,
but the field probably is too low. I mean, if you go to the 10 Tesla magnetic field, I don't know what will happen, but I don't think it's very important.
The electric field is very dramatic effect, and it's a direct effect. So this is a strain we built that has a calcium probe in it, the same type of hydra, just with a calcium probe in the epithelium, and you can see the, I should, I want to stop it.
Okay, look for example on this. So the blips you see here, the fluorescence reflect excitation of calcium activity in the tissue, and to my surprise, the calcium activity is very local.
It doesn't spread, there are no waves or something that spread. These waves and spreading occurs only in mature animals, but in the developmental system during regeneration, it's very local with very finite correlation length.
This is very important because I'll try to convince you that calcium fluctuations are the driving force of the patterning. So if it becomes uniform, if it spreads all over the system in a fast way, then it cannot operate as such.
So along the way, these are the type of excitations we find in the hydra, and I want to show you what are the characteristics of these fluctuations.
And again, the importance of, calcium is important in biology on different reasons, but in our case, first of all, calcium is a mediator between many processes, but in our case, it's a mediator between the electrical activity and the mechanics, and the mechanics completely depend on calcium.
Without calcium, optimization will not generate force. So the fluctuations, let me show you a little bit the fluctuations and correlations of the calcium field in hydra during regeneration.
We cut a piece, it falls into a spheroid. What you see here, look on the left side, this is a zero voltage. That's something I showed you before, you see this characteristic sawtooth, this is the area of the tissue, the projected area.
The green curves, the green curve is the mean fluorescence in the tissue over the entire tissue, and the blue is the variance, the spatial variance of the calcium.
So it reflects how different parts of the tissue behave in terms of the calcium excitations, and what you see, you see spikes or burst of activity of the calcium at zero voltage, and this goes all the way, if you let it go, it goes all the way to regeneration.
But then we put a voltage that halts regeneration, it remains spherical, and you see a complete change in spectrum of the activity, both the area fluctuations and the calcium activity become completely different.
These are, by the way, the definitions of the variance, it's all spatial, and the tissue remains spheroid, but the great thing about this is that we can hold the system at that state, for example, for days, and gather statistics, and try to understand the fluctuations,
and then release it and see how it changes when the system starts to regenerate again, and because we can do it a few times, we can really gather statistics on the process,
and this brings me to a second control, which you are also familiar in your group, which is the partial blocking of gap junctions.
So in our case, we use heptanol as a blocker, with the same family as octanol and all this, I found out that heptanol hydra is tolerated very well, so there is no problem,
and to my surprise, not maybe, it shouldn't be surprise, not only heptanol halts regeneration, the same as the electric field, and I come back to it and show you why, there are really the opposite effects,
because electric field excites the calcium in the system, and heptanol decays the calcium, both of them halts regeneration, so you can again hold it for whatever time you want and study the calcium activity,
and then you wash it out, and you start to get it again, and it regenerates, but the most surprising thing that will come to it a bit later is that you apply heptanol to the fully regenerated animal, and it falls back.
Okay, and this question, what are the concentration of heptanol, to use, etc., that required a lot of trial and error experiments, because you can destroy the tissue if you really block gap junctions, if you block gap junctions completely,
you really disintegrate the tissue, they are really required to keep the system, but anyway, what you see here, you lose this order spikes and everything by heptanol, you wash it out and you get it back,
and these are the summary of the statistics, this is the probability density function, so these are normalized distributions under four conditions,
the red is electric field, under electric field, that halts regeneration, blue is normal condition, heptanol is in green, and the black is a tissue in a soft gel that exerts mechanical pressure on the tissue, it allows regeneration, but clearly it produces small animals and there is mechanical pressure,
mechanical forces on the tissue itself, the upper curves, this is the mean, this is the variance, spatial variance, this is the curve, so it's standard deviation of the mean, so it's normalized fluctuations, and this is the skewness, so this is the third moment that reflects asymmetric against everything spatial,
and then we take long time traces, we treat them as statistical ensembles and normalize these curves by the ensemble mean of each of these measures and divide by standard deviation,
the reason for that is to get a standard distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation to compare shapes, I want to see if these shapes are really different,
so I normalize them, certainly under heptanol, when you block gap junctions, you get a much weaker cultural activity, and also the variance goes down, when you excite it, you get higher, but the question whether these shapes are different cannot be compared like that if you don't normalize,
so I want to remove the trivial effect of getting weaker or stronger, and when we do this, this is a nice result, it shows that the normalized fluctuations, the standard deviation of the mean, when they normalize properly,
for all tissue samples, for all conditions, you get a universal curve, so the shape distribution is insensitive, so it's the same shape distribution,
the same thing occurs for the right side of the skewness, but on the left side there is some asymmetry, I don't know if we have time to discuss this, but this is significant, because what this tells us is that there are some constraints on the cultural fluctuations,
In your language maybe it's a zero sum game type of thing, so if part of the tissue is excited, then other parts should be inhibited, so there is a zero sum game keeping the shape of the distribution the same for all conditions,
we are still not fully understand the constraint, but this is something to take into account in modeling this system,
okay, and the last piece about the calcium is the correlation function, which you see for the four conditions, so this is a length, it's normalized by a length scale,
I don't have time to discuss why this length scale is interesting, which is 40% of the tissue, because every tissue will have different size, so to compare correlations you need to normalize the distance by the fraction of the tissue if you want,
but the length fraction of the tissue, what is clear from here is that under voltage, under external electric field, you get the most extended correlations, other blocking gag junction, you get least extended,
but at any rate, correlations decay at much smaller length scales than the size of the tissue, this reflects again the locality of the calcium excitation during the regeneration,
this is just log scale to amplify the differences, okay, so I'm going to skip, so this is the minimal model, it's an excitable system, it requires two fields, activator and inhibitor,
with a threshold, non-linear threshold, as you see here, you can ignore the inhibitor by putting everything in a time scale, I'm not going to get into details, what I just want to say is at the end you get something like a langivine equation with the potential, this is the derivative of the potential,
and you can, I don't know if this language is familiar to you, then you convert it to Focker Planck, you get the steady state solution, and the steady state solution you can derive from it the distributions of the mean variance of all the statistics,
and it turns out that the potential you need in order to get the right shapes that we get from the experiment is a double well potential, this is not surprising, this is an excitable system,
in an excitable system, you either have one fixed point, or three fixed points, two are stable and one is unstable, this is the meaning of being excitable, you go from one fixed point to another,
and so this is the excitation, and so we can figure out what is the potential, I'm not going to, and get the right shapes of the distributions, more or less, I mean this is not perfect,
so we don't know exactly what is the potential, but we can deduce at least parts of it from the experiment itself, so okay, so now I'm coming today, I don't know how much time I have, what's the situation with the time?
keep going, it's fine, keep going, okay, so now I want to go into the main part, so all this was operative if you want, to something that I consider as really a very important way of trying to understand morphological transitions during morphogenesis,
so again, I cannot generalize it, let's talk about Hydra, so in Hydra this is more or less the timeline, what happens is that you take a fragment, it falls into a spheroid, and then for something like around 48 hours say, the spheroid just fluctuates around the spherical shape,
without much happening from the morphology point of view, certainly we know that from the molecular and cellular biology there is a lot going on, a lot, we call it the preparatory stage, but from the morphology point of view not much happens,
and then after this long period, boom, the spheroid becomes a tube in just a few minutes, it becomes a tube and this develops into, so you want to understand this transition, it's a geometrical transition, not a topological transition, because it's the same topology,
but the geometry goes from a sphere like to a tube, and this is an essential or even the major morphological transition that allows regeneration, if you prevent this, that's exactly what the electric field and blocking gap junction is doing, then there is no regeneration, it must go through this transition,
let me show you a movie that shows this transition and how sharp it is, so this is again, I just zoom around the transition point, this is on the left is bright field, this is fluorescent of the same tissue, and you see the time scales here,
so it fluctuates, fluctuates, and then at some point you start to see a little bit of fluctuation to a sphere and then it goes, and this transition is really very very sharp, and from this point on it will make tentacles and all this, the rest of the machinery that makes the mature hydra,
but the point is that this transition is really very sharp, you go, but you could see a little bit of fluctuation that will come back to him here, this is a fluctuation, it goes back, back, and then it goes,
okay, so in order to study this, we define something that we call the shape parameter, for the physicists, this is analogous to an order parameter in phase transitions, in thermodynamic phase transitions,
and the shape parameter that is relevant to our case for this morphological change, we defined it as 1- the area of the tissue, the projected area, divided by square perimeter of it,
and this goes to, this is 0 for an ideal sphere, and it goes to 1 for a long infinite cylinder or tube,
and what you see here in this graph, this is time, so there is a long trace before that which is boring, it just does something like that, it fluctuates around the sphere, the spheroid,
then at some point you start to see some fluctuations, and then boom, it goes, but see how sharp it is, this is a very sharp transition between a spheroid and a tube,
and this is summarized under three conditions, this is normal condition, no field, nothing, this is partial blocking of gap junctions that doesn't stop the regeneration process, but it affects the system,
this is under voltage below critical that allows regeneration, but again affects the system, and what you see, for example the blue curve here, is the average of many tissue samples around this transition,
so we take many traces, we lock on the transition, make it 0 for all the traces, and then average around it, and you see this characteristic shape, the black line I'll come back to it as a theoretical solution for a model,
and it gives you the time scale, and the time scale here is in minutes, so this is for example 7.6 minutes transition, so 48 hours you have nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, just small fluctuation, then in a few minutes it goes,
this is a very sharp transition under blocking gap junctions, it becomes longer, and in fact we can play with it a little bit and see that time scales are clearly affected by blocking gap junctions,
and under electric field we don't have much room to play because I don't want to stop the process, I want to let it go, but still you see that it's a little bit shorter,
but all of them have shown this more or less sharp transition, which looks like this hyperbolic tangent, which is a result of a computation that I'll show you in a moment, okay?
So this is something that is of great interest because here we have a morphological transition, it's a major morphological transition that is very important for a generation, and the question what actually is going on becomes an interesting question,
which we can translate into a piece of interesting physics as I'll show you in a second, but again I'm not going to bombard you with too much jargon or anything, okay?
Any question about this? This is clear? This is the thing we ought to understand, and connect it to the culture.
So when you say partial gap junction blocking, is this a lesser degree of blocking than you used to take the fully grown developed hydra and make it revert to the steroid?
I didn't show you yet that I can revert to fully develop by blocking gap junction, I'll show you in a moment, I just said it, we can, yes, but the problem is, the problem with all this, which is also problematic in the case of electric field, is that there are no absolute numbers,
because each tissue sample as its own individuality, history, there's the problem in general in developmental system in biology, so I don't know absolute numbers, so what I do is I know that above a certain level of ebtonol of blocking gap junctions, I can stop the process.
What is the critical concentration, it's tissue dependent, I don't know exactly to tell you a number, so what I do, I reduce it enough to get, to see that statistically most of the samples will just go and do regeneration.
But you can play with it, I mean there is a lot of room to try to understand what really blocking gap junction is doing, I don't know, you know, the sensitivity of it, et cetera, that's I don't know.
I know that if I put too much, I can destroy the sample, if I go below destroying the sample, I can stop regeneration, if I go below this, I get regeneration.
It doesn't mean that you take the same concentration that stops regeneration in one tissue sample will not allow regeneration in another sample, this is due to tissue individuality that certainly plays an important role.
Okay, so I'm not insisting on absolute numbers, I don't care about them, what I care is that I see a real effect and because we have a calcium probe, you can see immediately that ebtonol, that blocking gap junctions affects the system, you see it immediately, I mean it's not something that I have to guess because I have a probe that tells me something happened to the calcium.
Okay, does it answer? I don't know.
It does, I'm leaning towards a bigger question that maybe I'll hold off on, but you know, the quick summary of the bigger question is, point the devil's advocate, I had expected you to answer, Santhosh, and tell him that you saw processes aligning themselves to an electric field, and when you said that you're not seeing that, then my sort of devil's advocate thought.
No, no, see what? I didn't hear you.
Oh, so when Santhosh asked before whether you saw any alignment of the morphology to the direction or polarity of the electric field, you said no.
