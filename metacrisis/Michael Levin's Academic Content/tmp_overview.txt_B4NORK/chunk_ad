1. The conversation revolved around the idea of neurons potentially 'traveling' to a place where they believe they can no longer be energetically useful, a concept that aligns with the active inference framework where neurons attempt to fit incoming data to their expectations or adapt their expectations to better match incoming data.

2. The discussion touched upon the challenge of encoding theories into a system and how some frameworks, like those based on category theory, might offer a clearer, logical basis for interpretation compared to continuous models that can be harder to interpret.

3. The interlocutors expressed interest in collaborating on projects related to these ideas, with one participant suggesting the potential for a grant or joint work.

4. One of the participants has moved from MIT's math department to the Topos Institute, a category theory think tank based in the Bay Area, though they are currently at a retreat in Austin, Texas.

5. Mike Adams, who is interested in these topics, will likely reach out to the participants after watching the recording of their discussion.

6. The email address for contacting the participant from the Topos Institute was shared in the chat, and it is likely the same one Mike Adams used to communicate with them earlier.

7. Overall, the conversation was described as fun and productive, with a mutual interest in exploring further the intersection of neuroscience, active inference, and category theory.

1. **Ion Concentration Variable**: The discussion moved to the introduction of another variable, like calcium ion concentrations, which can influence electrical activity in tissues through dynamics that affect voltage-gated channels and can lead to the emergence of patterns and waves similar to those observed in voltage alone.

2. **Narrative Dynamics for Tissue Interaction**: Narratives (mathematical models) are sufficient to capture the interactions between different tissue types when a penetrating entity, like a neurite or migratory cell, interacts with its surroundings. This interaction can trigger waves in the surrounding tissue due to the expression levels of ion channels and the strength of gap junction coupling.

3. **Directionality of Waves**: The direction of wave propagation in line oscillation experiments depends on the initial conditions set by the excitation protocol, where applying a pulse at a certain point and then stimulating an adjacent point can initiate waves traveling either clockwise or counterclockwise.

4. **Gap Junction Permeability to Die**: Two papers on gap junction permeability to dye were mentioned as references for understanding the role of gap junctions in cell communication.

5. **Nonlinear Coherent Flows and Time Scales**: A question was raised about the time scales of voltage circulations compared to cytoskeletal fluid flows, like those studied by Zvonimir Dojic at UCSB. The expectation is that while the underlying physics might be similar, the time scales are likely different due to distinct physical parameters governing each process.

6. **Acknowledgments**: The work presented was initiated by Harry McNamara, now at Princeton, and involved contributions from graduate student Rebecca Frank and postdoc Halel Ori in the lab where the research was conducted. Thanks were expressed to all who contributed to the study.

1. **Xenobots Introduction**: Dr. Goldberg introduced Xenobots, artificial organisms created by manipulating skin cells from the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). These Xenobots can reproduce by collecting and sculpting loose skin cells into new individuals overnight, demonstrating a form of kinematic self-replication.

2. **Evolutionary Insights**: The Xenobots' ability to replicate from their environment without genetic engineering or complex programming suggests that the genome of Xenopus laevis has evolved capabilities beyond just producing tadpoles. This indicates that evolution may often produce general-purpose problem-solving machines rather than specific solutions to particular problems.

3. **General Purpose Problem Solvers**: The implication is that biological systems are highly interoperable, and by combining different elements of evolved biology with designed matter and software, a vast array of new life forms can be created. This opens up an enormous space of possibilities for organisms that do not necessarily share a common ancestor with humans and may have fundamentally different embodiments and minds.

4. **Ethical and Scientific Considerations**: The creation of such hybrid organisms raises significant ethical questions about how we relate to these new forms of life, especially as we push the boundaries of what is possible in synthetic biology and artificial life.

5. **Acknowledgments**: Dr. Goldberg acknowledged the contributions of postdocs, students, funders, and illustrators, emphasizing that the model systems do most of the work. The presentation also included disclosures related to two companies.

6. **Further Reading**: Dr. Goldberg provided a list of papers for those interested in exploring this research further.

In essence, Dr. Goldberg's work with Xenobots demonstrates that the genome of Xenopus laevis has evolved a remarkable capability to produce complex structures without the need for genetic engineering or pre-existing circuits. This discovery challenges our understanding of evolution and biological development and opens up new avenues for synthetic biology, with profound implications for the future of life on Earth.

1. **Connectionist Models**: Traditional models that focus on the computational aspects of neural networks but neglect the spatial and temporal dimensions of actual neural processes.

2. **If-Aptic Coupling**: The synchronization of electrical activity between neurons and their supporting astrocytes, which is crucial for various brain functions but has been under-investigated in comparison to synaptic coupling.

3. **Synaptic and If-Aptic Signal Interaction**: The interplay between the signals across synapses and if-aptic pathways can bias neuroplasticity towards forming hexagonal patterns, which could be relevant for morphogenetic self-organization.

4. **Global Coupling to Localization**: Mediated inhibitory neurons play a role in producing global coupling and localizing it to specific areas, which is important for brain function and development.

5. **Relevance for Neural Tube Closure**: Electric gradients guide pattern formation in embryogenesis, as seen in the successful closure of the neural tube. Disruption of bidirectional synchrony can lead to failure in this process.

6. **Somitogenesis**: The segmentation of the somites during embryogenesis involves a slow and a fast signal that interact to produce morphogenetic outcomes, similar to the interaction between different signals in neural development.

7. **Open Questions and Challenges**:
   - To what extent do similar mechanisms found in neural development also apply to other biological systems?
   - How can we model these mechanisms computationally to understand and induce lasting network changes without causing excitotoxicity?

8. **Inhomogeneity of Neurons**: The complex morphology of neurons, including the polarization of dendrites versus the soma, must be considered in signal transmission to avoid oversimplification of neural networks.

9. **Experimental Implementation**: Practical questions about how to experimentally investigate these mechanisms and induce network changes in vitro.

10. **Optimal Simulation Regime**: Determining the conditions under which simulations can accurately model neuroplasticity and avoid negative outcomes like excitotoxicity.

11. **In-Vitro Experiments**: Proposed experiments using neurons grown on electrodes or Maxwell plates to shed light on similar processes in vivo (in the living body).

12. **Collaboration Acknowledgment**: The research presented is a collaborative effort with Katharine Herez, Franz, and Ernst Koster, who have all contributed to these ideas.

In summary, the talk highlighted the importance of considering both synaptic and if-aptic signals in understanding neural network dynamics, especially in the context of neuroplasticity and morphogenetic self-organization. It also pointed out the need for more experimental work to understand the complexities of neuronal morphology and signal transmission, as well as the development of computational models that can accurately simulate these processes without causing harm to the biological systems under study.

Checking Michael Levin's Academic Content/Exploratory Learning in Biological Cells - a talk by Naama Brenner on Feb 13, 2024.txt
1. The discussion centered around the concept of cellular learning and how it relates to networks and stress detection in cells.

2. The model for cellular learning was developed with input from Ares Rosak, Hades Schreyer (PhD student), and Omri Barak, among others, at the Technion and the Weizmann Institute of Science.

3. The theory of cellular learning aims to understand how cells can learn through a process that resembles behavioral experiments, potentially leading to applications like teaching bacteria to metabolize plastic.

4. The model imposes a low-dimensional constraint as a fitness function to enable learning, which can both simplify and limit the problems the system can solve.

5. The question was raised about whether the network structure that includes outgoing hubs might constrain the variety of problems that can be solved by reducing the number of ways the fitness function could be formulated.

6. It was noted that cells have mechanisms to sense and respond to different types of stress, but in their model, they rely on the fact that stress causes a range of behaviors in cells, which is not a new concept.

7. The universal stress response in cells involves a group of genes that can respond to various kinds of stress, but there's no strong evidence yet that this specific stress module is being used in their model of cellular learning.

8. Measurement challenges and the need for single-cell or high-throughput experiments were mentioned as important for furthering the understanding of how cells detect stress and learn.

9. The potential application of this research includes designing tasks to be learned by cells, which could have implications in fields like biotechnology and environmental science.

10. There is a caveat regarding the current measurements used in their model, suggesting that new technologies and tests could provide more insight into the mechanisms involved.

Checking Michael Levin's Academic Content/Global organization and evolution of the virus world by Eugene V. Koonin.txt
1. Viruses are ubiquitous and abundant in the biosphere, representing the most numerous biological entities. New technologies like metabiromics, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics have revolutionized virus discovery and have begun to bring order to the world of viruses.

2. The reconstruction of ancient viral communities is now possible by mapping modern viral groups onto phylogenetic trees of their hosts, such as bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. This approach allows scientists to infer the complexity and diversity of viral communities at different points in Earth's history, including the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA).

3. The findings suggest that the viral world was already highly complex by the time of LUCA, with a diversity comparable to that of modern bacteria and archaea. This implies that the microbial world at that time was not uniform but rather a collection of diverse organisms.

4. For eukaryotic viruses, most major groups can be traced back to bacterial ancestors, not archaeal ones, despite the fact that many key features of eukaryotic cells (like replication, transcription, and translation) are believed to originate from archaea. This surprising result is hypothesized to be due to the different membrane compositions between bacteria and archaea, which may have prevented archaeal viruses from infecting early eukaryotic cells.

5. The study of ancient viruses is providing insights into the history of life on Earth and influencing our understanding of the cellular ancestors of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

6. The author acknowledges the contributions of many international collaborators and researchers who have been instrumental in advancing the field of virus evolution and diversity.

In summary, the study of viruses, particularly through modern genomics techniques, has revealed a complex and dynamic viral landscape that co-evolved with cellular life forms. This research not only sheds light on the origins and diversity of viruses but also offers new insights into the early history of life on Earth.

Checking Michael Levin's Academic Content/Growing ＂Brains＂ in Artificial Neural Networks.txt
1. **Modularity and Brain Architecture**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of anatomical modularity in brains, noting that both human and mammalian brains exhibit this characteristic, which may contribute to their efficient functioning. However, these brains also possess long-distance connections such as thalamocortical, frontoparietal, and corpus callosum connections that facilitate complex cognitive processes.

2. **Quantitative Measures of Modularity**: To quantify the modularity of a synthetic brain network, the speaker proposes two measures:
   - The fraction of isolated neurons: A high fraction indicates strong modularity, while a low fraction suggests a lack of distinct modules or a randomly permuted configuration.
   - The average cluster size: A smaller cluster size indicates stronger localization and modularity.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The synthetic brain model developed by the speaker shows a significantly lower fraction of isolated neurons and larger average cluster sizes compared to random permutations, indicating the presence of anatomical modularity.

4. **Potential Biological Implications**: The speaker suggests that the concept of anatomical modularity could be tested in biological systems by examining connectivity across the corpus callosum and correlating it with cognitive performance, particularly in split-brain patients where the corpus callosum has been disconnected.

5. **Question on Cognitive Performance**: The speaker acknowledges that while their work demonstrates the utility of anatomical modularity for explainability, it raises the question of whether this modularity is also beneficial for problem-solving capabilities in biological systems.

6. **Future Research Directions**: The speaker posits that future research could explore how to model or reproduce the parallel statistics found in brain networks, which might require new methods beyond the current approach.

In summary, the speaker's talk highlights the importance of anatomical modularity in synthetic brain models and suggests potential biological implications for understanding cognitive functions and problem-solving abilities. The speaker also opens up a discussion on how to model long-distance connections and parallel processing statistics in artificial neural networks to better reflect the complexity of real brains.

Checking Michael Levin's Academic Content/High school student's project presentation on a survey of attitudes to AI and diverse intelligence..txt
1. The initial approach to deploying the survey on Mike 11's Twitter was effective but limited to a specific demographic, primarily those who were already familiar with the subject matter due to their interest in Mike 11 and his content.

2. A broader audience could have provided more diverse responses to the questions posed in the survey, potentially offering a wider range of perspectives on the topics discussed.

3. The survey was designed with a wide range of response options (definitely yes, maybe yes, maybe, definitely no) to allow participants to express their views clearly, though this did complicate data analysis due to the increased number of variables.

4. The findings from the survey are important as they can inform researchers and policymakers about public sentiment on emerging issues related to biotechnology, AI ethics, and the implications of creating novel life forms. These topics are increasingly relevant and will require public input and consideration as they evolve.

5. Key insights from the data analysis included recognizing that there is a wide range of opinions across different demographics on these issues, suggesting that future discussions should consider this diversity to effectively address societal concerns.

6. Actions for attendees and interested parties include taking the survey themselves to contribute to the dataset, studying up on related topics using provided resources, and potentially designing their own surveys on similar subjects to further explore public opinion on these complex matters.

7. Credits go to Dustin Erdash for assistance with securing funding through the DISI grant to expand the survey's reach and to Mike Eleven for his contributions in constructing and distributing the survey.

8. The session concluded with an invitation for any further questions and emphasized the importance of continued engagement and study on these critical issues.

 The discussion revolves around the emergence of complex behaviors and properties from simple systems, a field known as active matter. This field is seen as complementing rather than undermining the ideas about deep cognition being a feature of the universe. The participants agree that the emergence of unexpected problem-solving behavior in minimal systems, like those consisting of just two or three chemicals in a self-propelled system, suggests that there is a continuum between what might be considered 'animate' and 'inanimate'.

The idea is that consciousness does not necessarily begin with life but is a manifestation of the universe's inherent potential for complexity and diversity. The discovery that the first three chemicals tried by scientists for creating such systems resulted in surprising problem-solving abilities indicates that the space of possible implementations for complex behavior is not sparse but incredibly dense, possibly limitless.

This perspective underscores the belief that consciousness and intelligence can emerge from non-living matter and that the cosmos has an inherent tendency to produce complexity and variety. The discussion also touches on the importance of understanding that simply knowing the parts of a system does not mean we understand the whole, and that emergent properties can arise in ways we have not predicted or engineered.

Checking Michael Levin's Academic Content/Iain McGilchrist, Richard Watson, and Mile Levin #4.txt
 The conversation revolves around the distinction between mere control over a system and a deeper understanding of it. The speakers argue that knowing how to manipulate a system to achieve predictable outcomes (e.g., an engineer who can build a three-fold elephant) does not equate to truly understanding the system itself. A more profound comprehension requires a reciprocal, bidirectional relationship where both parties—the observer and the observed—benefit from the interaction.

In biology, this means that simply manipulating biological systems (like genetic engineering or pharmacological interventions) is not enough to claim an understanding of life's complexity. The nature of our interventions can influence the outcomes we observe, which in turn affects our understanding and subsequent actions. This suggests a dynamic, non-linear process where our models and theories are constantly subject to revision as new insights emerge.

The speakers emphasize that biology might need to move beyond a purely mechanical understanding of life, just as physics has had to expand its view beyond classical mechanics to include quantum mechanics. This shift could potentially lead to a revolution in biology, where the existing frameworks and models may be insufficient to fully grasp the intricacies of life's phenomena. The implication is that our approach to understanding living systems should be more holistic, recognizing the complexity and interconnectedness inherent in biological processes.

Checking Michael Levin's Academic Content/Karl Friston, Adam Goldstein, and Michael Levin discuss active inference and algorithms.txt
 In this conversation, the topic revolves around the concept of clustering in dynamic systems and its implications for complex behaviors such as voting dynamics, geopolitical situations, and the spread of information. The discussion touches upon the underlying goals and motivations that drive such behaviors, using a simple model of integers being sorted as an analogy.

Key points include:

1. **Clustering Tendency**: It was observed that without an overarching force to disrupt it, there is a natural tendency for items (in this case, integers) to cluster. This tendency can be seen as a hidden motivation in complex systems.

2. **50-50 Split**: The observation that ideological or political commitments often end up with a 50-50 split is mentioned, suggesting an evolutionary stable strategy for energy minimization. This self-similar division can be seen at various levels within a system.

3. **Dynamic Systems and Frustration**: The concept of frustration in dynamical systems, particularly in chimeric situations where detailed balance is broken, is proposed as a metaphor for voting dynamics or information spread. This can lead to interesting behaviors that are not immediately obvious from the underlying physics.

4. **Competing Dynamics**: The model demonstrates a competition between the tendency to cluster and the physical forces (in this case, the sorting algorithm) that tend to disperse the items. This can be seen as analogous to the existential struggles of living systems within the constraints of their environment.

5. **Further Research**: The suggestion is made to explore these dynamics further by introducing noise into the model and observing how the clustering tendency persists or changes, potentially using concepts from dynamical systems theory.

6. **References**: A paper by Connor Hines, which draws parallels between Gibbs energy and free energy in the context of idea exchange, is recommended for further understanding of these concepts as they relate to collective behavior.

In summary, the conversation highlights the complexity of behaviors in dynamic systems and suggests that underlying goals or motivations can lead to observable patterns like clustering. These patterns are influenced by both the inherent nature of the system and the external forces acting upon it, much like living organisms navigate their environments. The analogy between sorting integers and larger societal behaviors serves as a useful tool for understanding the underlying dynamics at play in complex systems.

Checking Michael Levin's Academic Content/Mark Solms and Michael Levin discuss explicit and implicit behavioral drives.txt
1. The discussion begins with the idea that each cell within a swarm or cluster might simply be performing its inherent function without any overarching cognition, from the individual cell's perspective.

2. However, it's noted that in some systems, such as the immune system or certain animal collectives like ants, there are 'master' cells that coordinate activities at a higher level than the 'slave' cells, which is a more complex view of group behavior.

3. The suggestion is made to experiment with giving some cells within the cluster more power—allowing them to see further or push harder—to see if this leads to a more structured or hierarchical emergent behavior reminiscent of a nervous system within the cluster.

4. This discussion is connected to a previous conversation about C. elegans worms, which have adult stem cells that can regenerate the entire organism. It's clarified that while these stem cells are crucial for growth and repair, they may not carry the majority of the animal's information, as an experiment involving irradiating the stem cells in a two-headed worm and transplanting its somatic cells into a one-headed worm resulted in the latter becoming a two-headed worm without the need for new cell types from the stem cells.

5. The key takeaway is that there's a distinction between knowing what to do (which may not require stem cells) and actually building or regenerating the body (which typically requires stem cells). This highlights the complexity of information storage, processing, and implementation within biological systems.

Checking Michael Levin's Academic Content/Michael Levin talk on bioelectricity at Stanford Chemical Engineering Colloquium.txt
1. **Bioelectrical Signaling**: The presentation emphasizes the importance of bioelectrical signaling as a key determinant in morphogenesis—the process by which cells in an organism's body determine their fates and establish the structure of the body. This electrical communication is a critical intermediate step between an organism's genetic makeup and its physical form.

2. **Ion Channel Drugs**: The talk introduces the concept of using ion channel drugs, which currently make up approximately 20% of all drugs, as a toolkit for modifying bioelectrical patterns to influence tissue growth and regeneration. These drugs can be repurposed because their safety profiles are well-established from existing human use.

3. **Computational Modeling**: The presentation outlines a computational simulation engine that can predict which ion channels need to be modulated to shift a tissue's state towards a desired outcome. This model integrates known expression data of ion channels in different tissues with physiomic profiling to create a roadmap for regeneration or morphogenesis.

4. **Electroseuticals**: The approach is termed "electroseuticals," where the correct electrical patterns can guide tissue growth without the need to manage every aspect of the downstream cellular and molecular processes, which can take care of themselves once the electrical state is set.

5. **Potential Applications**: The method has implications for regenerative medicine, where it might be possible to stimulate the regrowth of limbs or organs by electrically 'programming' cells. This could have significant implications for repairing damaged tissues and organs in humans.
