Hello. First, I'd like to warmly welcome you to the Anna Freud Center,
to our second series of transformation seminars. Today is the third seminar of the series.
We are really delighted that so many of you are able to join us.
These debates are about your questions, about your thoughts, about us collectively developing
a new vision for mental health. We look forward to receiving your comments and questions and hope
that you all will be inspired to continue these discussions after the seminar.
We are holding these seminars because we feel there is an urgent need for a national discussion
around mental health of children and young people and their families.
Mental health has become a focus during the pandemic and we hope that once we are beyond
the crisis, we will be able to rebuild better for all of us, also in terms of the mental health
of our young people who are at the sharpest end of their current pressures.
The theme of the transformation seminars is thinking differently about mental health.
We invite speakers to respond to a simple question and ask them what is their idea to transform
children's and family's mental health in the UK. The seminars explore areas beyond clinical
authorities are to ask about how we can think about do things differently, individually,
collectively and as a society to reduce the growing needs we have as individuals in our
complex and interconnected social world and tackle some of the underlying causes of mental health.
After the presentation we would like to invite you to ask questions.
You'll see at the bottom of the screen that there is a space for Q&As
and if you'd like to submit your questions we'll try to get through as many of them as we can
in the time that we have available. Finally, if you are tweeting please tag us
at EFNCCF and use the hashtag transformation seminars.
Today I am honored and delighted to welcome someone who is a world-renowned exceptional
thinker in his field. When I say his field it truly is his because no one has the breadth and
depth of understanding of the human mind quite like Carl Frister. Carl is a theoretical neuroscientist
and a world authority on brain imaging and computational neuroscience. He's one of the
most innovative thinkers about mental health alive today. He's welcome professor of imaging
neuroscience at UCL. He started off in psychiatry but has been an independent and
extraordinarily creative thinker blinding his own original furrow. His revolutionary impact on studies
of the brain derives from his inventive use of probability theory to analyze neural imaging data.
He invented the technique statistical parametric mapping or SPM
that is now widely used almost universally to look for correspondences in brain activity as
measured by magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive function.
He also invented voxel-based morphometry a sensitive method for measuring
the volume of brain structures. One classical well-known application demonstrated the increased
volume of a region underlying spatial memory and the brains of London taxidramas. Carl
is dynamic, Carl's dynamic causal modeling is used to estimate how different cortical
regions of the brain influence one another. His current thinking about brain function is
revolutionizing our ideas about perception, consciousness, mental disorder and the nature
of experience itself. The active inference framework or prediction error minimization
is a relatively recent theory in mathematical neuroscience pioneered by Carl and his collaborators.
It holds considerable promise to be the unifying theory of the brain.
It is used increasingly to support theoretical predictions in experimental research as well
as advance the existing theory of perception and action. My deep admiration for Carl reached
new heights through reading his contributions to independent sage or scientific advisory group
for emergencies. A group of scientists who are working together to provide independent scientific
advice to the UK government and the public and how to minimize deaths and support Britain's recovery
from the COVID-19 crisis. Carl's awards and honours are far too numerous to mention. I will
just pick up a couple. He's a fellow of the Royal Society, a fellow of the Royal Society of Biology.
In 2003 he received a golden brain award, an international science award in the field of
neuroscience given to people who made breakthroughs in research on vision and the brain.
In 2013 he was awarded the International Weldon Memorial Prize, which is bestowed
on the person deemed to have published the most noteworthy contribution to the development of
mathematical or statistical methods applied to problems in biology in the previous decade.
In 2016 he received the Charles Branch Award for unparalleled breakthroughs in brain research
and the Glass Brain Award for his lifetime achievement in the field of human brain mapping.
This evening we will hear Carl discuss the emergence of selfhood and how our sense of
ourselves emerges in interaction with the minds around us. The seminar intriguingly
entitled Me and My Mark of Planket. We are very, very privileged to welcome one of the greatest
thinkers in neuroscience today. Welcome Carl. Thank you very much for that lovely introduction.
It's a true honour and pleasure to be with you this evening.
I am going to take the challenge of thinking differently about mental health very literally
to the extent that I feel I should apologise for
how different this lecture might be from the kind of lecture that you would anticipate
in this series. I'm going to attempt to provide a first principal account of
dietic interactions speaking to selfhood as an emergent property of those interactions,
but I'm going to do so from the point of view of a physicist. So I'm going to present a lecture
of two halves. The first, again I apologise, is really a foundational course in the way things
work, the physics of self-organisation. And I'm going to lift from that an understanding of
sentience as an emergent property of self-organisation. So I'm going to talk basically
about the maths of the mechanics of mind. And I'm going to illustrate some of the simpler
principles that emerge from this treatment using simulations of a primordial soup.
And the end point really is a synchronisation between what's on the inside and what's on the
outside of anything that exists or self-organises itself to a state of existence. Then I'm going
to tell exactly the same story, but using the words and the language of a clinician or a neuroscientist
focusing on predictive processing and predictive coding formulations of how our brains work.
But the end point is exactly the same. It's the demonstration that the things that matter in
terms of our engagement with the world out there behind our sensorium rests upon a degree of
synchronisation. At the end I'm going to offer as a metaphor for alignment and the thing that glues
together you and me in any dyadic interaction. So that's the roadmap over the next few minutes.
I normally start the physics part of this talk with the question posed by Schrodinger.
How can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living
organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry? Now clearly we're not going to be able to answer
that question, but what we can do is just focus on the notion of a boundary of a living organism.
And of course to define anything and specifically a living organism you have to define what separates
the organism from not the organism, me from everything else, me from other. And Schrodinger
would be the first person to acknowledge that this boundary is in and of itself a statistical
process. And I'm going to read that boundary by borrowing from Bayesian mechanics the notion
of a Markov blanket. So a Markov blanket for those of you who don't know is a very simple
concept. It's a statistical set of states that insulates or separates internal states from
external states on the outside. So graphically we can consider some little universe here where each
of these circles corresponds to some state of this universe and the arrows or edges denote
an influence of this state on that state. And what I can do is I can identify a set of states
here encoded by blue as internal states and then I can define the Markov blanket or the blanket
states in terms of the parents, the children and the parents of the children. So that affords
a set of states that in effect provide all the information I need about the universe beyond
those states that will enable me to predict what will happen on the inside. So in other words,
statistically speaking, whatever is happening here is independent of what's happening here because
given or conditioned upon these blanket states, these blanket states hold all the information
that I need to tell me about how am I going to evolve about my dynamics. I'm going to make a
further move here. I'm just going to split by partition these blanket states mathematically
into two sets. One set which we're going to call sensory states that influence but are not influenced
by the internal states and another set active states that are influenced by internal states
but are not influenced by external states. And with that partition in place, I can now define
the states of any particle or person, a priest, anything that exists as the internal states
of that particle and their blanket states that comprise the sensory and the active states. And
you may be asking why have I done that? I think the intuition is more readily available if you
think about some of your favorite systems. So one of my favorite systems is the brain.
And one can consider the internal states of the brain as every state of synaptic activity,
efficacy, connectivity that constitutes a particular internal state of the brain.
And these internal states in your activity are communicated or influence active states,
my actuators, my autonomic nervous system that produces changes in the external states out there,
the physiological states of my body or the motor states of my motor plant that change the
sensations, the sensory states that are picked up and impinge upon my internal states so that
I have this sort of circular causality where the internal states exchange with the external states
through the Markov blanket, a dual carriageway where the influence of the inside on the outside
is mediated by the active states and the influence of the outside on the inside is mediated by
the sensory states. And these arrows are what license my attribution of states to internal
or external sensory or active in the sense that they denote the conditional independences that
we've just described that define the Markov blanket. But this structure can be found anywhere
that you can separate something from the rest of the universe. So for example, a little cell will
have internal states will correspond to the intracellular states, the active states could be
the actin filaments that support the surface states and push the surface states into the
external milieu, the external states that reciprocate by changing the cell's surface
sensory receptors that cause changes in the internal states. And so this perception action
cycle at this very elemental level is still in play and rests upon this Markovian partition
into internal, external and intervening blanket states. So what I want you to do now is to bear
that in mind, but forget about it for the moment. What we're going to do next is just to consider
the physics of systems that self-organize. And then what we're going to do is to put the Markov
blanket back in play and see what implications it has for the relationship between what's on the
inside and what's on the outside. So this is a bit heavy. Again, I apologize for the mathematics.
You don't need to understand the functional form of these equations, but I think they are useful
just to sketch the architecture of the ideas. And in fact, if you are mathematically minded,
they're simplicity. So what I've done here is just drawn the kind of universe that I'm interested in.
And I'm interested in universes that exist, that persist over time. So mathematically,
that means that they have an attracting set. Another word for that is that they constitute a
random dynamical system with a global random attractor. So more intuitively, I've just sketched
out two states here. It could be the temperature of my body, so the concentration of oxygen,
if I was a physiologist. And I've traced out over time the way that these states might change.
This could stand in for anything. It could be very fast fluctuations and electrical and chemical
constituents of a part of my brain unfold over milliseconds to give me
synchronized activity in the brain. It could be my heartbeat, two aspects of my heart contracting
every second or so. It could be me getting up in the morning, having a cup of coffee,
doing my emails, looking forward to lunch. It could be Christmas, Easter, some holidays,
birthday. This structure has to exist at any scale, at any spatial and temporal scale, crucially,
embodying the fact that its existence depends upon revisiting the same states, the neighborhood
of the same states, time and time again, after a suitable period of time. So these are the states
X, they change according to some flow here with some random perturbations or fluctuations
denoted by omega here. Now, the reason I've gone to some length in just casting the mathematical
basis of the arguments in terms of the flow of dynamical systems is it was a well-established
and very ubiquitous formulation of the behavior of these kinds of systems that inherits from the
fact that if I keep revisiting the same states, then I can treat this attracting set of states
that I keep revisiting that characterize me or things like me in terms of a probability distribution
that you will find me in this state if you sample me at any random time. And I can write down the
mathematics of the way that this probability distribution itself evolves. But we've just
said it doesn't change with time because we exist over time. So what we can do is we can solve
the equation describing the density dynamics, it's called the Fokker-Pank equation, you may
know it or you may not as the Schrodinger equation or the Maastre equation, they're
effectively all the same things. The solution to that, the particular solution for things that
exist over time is remarkable in the following sense. Using a particular decomposition, the
Helmholtz decomposition, it tells me immediately that things that exist will flow in a way that
can be described as a gradient flow on the log probability of being in any particular state.
I'm going to give you some intuition as to how this equation unpacks because I think it's quite
interesting but also just to illustrate its simplicity. What we're basically saying is that,
well let's imagine that I placed a drop of oil in some water or on say a sheet of dotting paper.
Now the kinds of systems that dissipate that were not interested in, that don't self-assemble and
don't have this attracting set of characteristic states, they would behave a little bit like this,
that the ink molecules would diffuse throughout the solvent until they dispersed everywhere
subject to the random molecular fluctuations. The systems that we're talking about, usually
living systems behave very differently. They appear to gather themselves up and assemble
in a restricted number of states or places that they could be. In other words, it looks as if
their states are flowing up concentration gradients, resisting or offsetting the random
fluctuations that will be dispersing them and that's all that this equation says. It just says that
any system that exists can be described in terms of its dynamics, its flow, its movement, its evolution
and that that flow can be decomposed into two components. There's the part that gathers things
up that resists the entropic erosion and dispersion, dissipation, decay, dilution that is this
component here that's proportional to the amplitude of the random fluctuations gamma and then there's
another component that's at right angles to that that circulates on the isopropability contours,
it's called solenoidal flow and this is denoted by the Q here. So anything that exists can be written
down in terms of its dynamics, in terms of this decomposition into a gradient flow that flows
up the concentration gradients and this circular or solenoidal flow and you'll all be familiar
with this very ubiquitous description of dynamics when you're looking at water flowing down the
plughole so the gradient flow is going downhill and this circular flow is the swirling around
one witnesses. So that's how things that exist behave dynamically. What about the Markov blanket?
Well what is true of all the states is true of the active and the internal states.
So at the same time that the internal states look as if they're performing a gradient flow
on the log probability of the blanket states it is also the case that the active states are doing
the same and I'm going to offer this as a mathematical image of perception changing our
internal states and action changing our active states but in the service of looking as if we're
increasing the same quantity and that quantity is this log probability of the blanket states.
So what does that mean? Well it's probably something that you're very familiar with depending upon
your commitments academically or the way that you understand optimization processes.
I've just listed a few things here and in the hope that you will recognize at least one if not all of
them. The first interpretation of this quantity here this log of the probability of my blanket
states being characteristic of the kind of thing I am me or my Markov blanket. We can interpret this
as simply an expression of value. These are the states that I aspire to that I am generally
found in. Mathematically we can approximate this quantity with something known as a free energy
or an evidence lower boundary machine learning but the perspective I'm selling in this interpretation
is that all systems that exist will look as if they are performing a gradient flow on this value
function and of course this is exactly the assumption, the foundation of reinforcement
learning, optimal control theory and an economics expected utility theory. So that's one perspective
an equivalent complementary perspective is on the negative value. So if you did information
theory this would be known as self information or surprise or more simply surprise the negative
log probability, the improbability of finding my blanket states in this state here which means
that we can construe the self organization of internal active states in terms of a suppression
of surprise and this leads to things like the infamax principle, the minimum redundancy principle
and indeed the free energy principle. That's nice because the time average of surprise is
mathematically called entropy which means it looks as if or it will any system that exists
will look as if it's trying to minimize its entropy. So this clearly is the holy grail of
synergetics that tries to understand the imperatives behind self-organization
and if you're a physiologist it's just homeostasis it's just gathering your physiological states within
bounds to preclude an entropic dispersion and wandering into non-viable or highly surprising
physiological states. I'm going to pursue another interpretation which is more statistical in
nature, inferential in nature. In statistics in particular Bayesian statistics the probability
of the blanket states given a Markov blanket or given me can also be interpreted as something
called model evidence or marginal likelihood, Bayesian model evidence. So this is basically saying
the states, the internal active states are changing in a way that appears to be maximizing
model evidence and that finds a nice home when unpacked in terms of the Bayesian brain hypothesis,
evidence accumulation and as we've heard in introduction things like predictive coding.
So if it's the case that anything that exists should look as if it was doing some sort of
prediction or modeling of what's beyond its Markov blanket then we should be able to simulate that
and show its emergence in any self-organizing system that possesses a Markov blanket. So
what I'm going to do is briefly show you some simulations of a little universe that we've
engineered precisely to show or to ask the question can we evince this kind of mechanics,
this kind of synchronization between the inside and the outside. So what we've done here is built
a little world comprised of 128 macromolecules. The details are not important, the same phenomena
emerge irrespective of the differential equations one uses. All we need to know is that they're all
loosely coupled and we can see them bubbling away at the bottom of a potential well here
and you may be asking well why have I done this? What are we going to do next? Well because we've
written down the equations of motion that underwrite the flow that we've been talking about we know
what influences what, we know which molecules, synthetic molecules influence which other
synthetic molecules and we can preclude action to distance and in virtue of that we can now
define the conditional dependencies that define the Markov blanket. So the hope was that we'll be
able to find a little creature living in this synthetic primordial soup defined purely on the
basis of its Markov blankets, the parents, the children and the parents and the children
defined by this adjacency matrix and here indeed is a little viral-like particle
wiggling around in the middle of this synthetic soupy little psyllium or tail here where the
internal states have been color coded with blue. The active states that typically in these simple
simulations usually underlie the sensory states in magenta here pushing them into the external
states externally in cyan here. So this simulation reveals that there is indeed a little creature
living in the middle of this soup that's quite happily attaining and maintaining its visiting,
its attracting sets, maintaining its technically non-equilibrium steady state. But the question now
is can we find any evidence that the internal states are somehow maximizing the evidence for
some implicit model of what's going on on the outside. In other words, do internal states appear
to infer the causes of their sensory states? Some people in philosophy like to call this
self-evidencing, soliciting evidence for your own existence. And it's relatively easy to demonstrate
indeed this process is manifest. This example here is used to illustrate the simulation of
synthetic evaporative potentials used in cognitive neuroscience and electrophysiology.
But just to quickly walk you through it because what I want to get to is this
underlying construct called a synchronization manifold. What we've done here is ask are there
any mixtures of the internal states that will predict the motion of the external states?
So this is a little bit like asking are there any patterns of neuronal activity in the visual brain
that accompany motion, visual motion outside that is registered by our sensory epithelia?
And indeed it is easy to find this. This has to exist and I'll explain why in a second.
Here is an illustration. So what we've done here is take a mixture of motions,
fluxes of the external states shown in cyan. The prediction of those and the 90% confidence
intervals based just upon the internal states. Remembering that the internal states can't see
the external states. All they know is how the external states impress themselves on the sensory
states and the influence of the sensory states by the active states on the internal states.
And we can see there's a remarkable correspondence between the implicit knowledge, the inference
predicated on the internal fluctuations about what's going on on the outside despite the fact
that there is no direct access. And indeed if we gather together little excursions here
and average them we can simulate event-related potentials. Here's an empirical example from
monkey electrophysiology. So you may be asking well how does this happen? Why is it the case?
Well it must be the case in the sense that for any given blanket state there must be
an average internal state and an average external state which means there must exist
for any given blanket state the expected internal mode of activity and an external
mode of activity and all we're seeing is fluctuations on this synchronization manifold.
And I'm using the word synchronization manifold just to bring to closure the first half of this
talk with a nod to what has been understood for centuries and in particular the notion of
generalized synchronization or synchronization of chaos noted by Christian Huygens many many
years ago and most of you will be familiar with this. It's the observation that suspend
two clocks from the same wall or beam and inevitably after a period of time they will
start to oscillate in synchrony. They will become entrained, they will become aligned.
There is no other solution and this is basically just an illustration of this fundamental property
of coupled dynamical systems in this instance we're covering the inside to the outside
vicariously through the blanket states. So here's actually a drawing by Huygens with two
clocks suspended from the same beam so from our point of view one clock or one pendulum
can be the internal states and the other can be the external states and they are coupled through the
beam in terms of the blanket states comprising the active and the sensory states. So I like this
construct because it illustrates the complete symmetry here so if you subscribe to this
interpretation of synchronization where the inside is trying to or you are trying to infer
what's going on in the world then you also have to accept that the world is trying to infer
what you're about and what you're doing and that's not a non-sensible interpretation when it comes
to things like niche construction and the like. However we're going to try to get back to this
notion of synchronization through another route but let me just first of all summarize what we've
done with all the heavy lifting in terms of the physics. What we're saying is that the existence
of a particle or a person anything that exists implies a partition of a system state systemic
states into internal blanket namely sensory and active and external states that are hidden behind
the mark of blanket and because active states changed but are not changed by external states
they're going to reduce the average surprise or the entropy of blanket states and this means that
action will appear to maintain the structural and functional integrity of the blanket and some
people like to discuss this in terms of self-assembly and chemistry or the knife sciences or the
internal states appear to infer the hidden causes of sensory states by increasing their
Bayesian model evidence namely self-evidencing and actively influence those causes
via what is often called in my world active inference. Just one little twist here for
philosophers there is an argument that the internal states in virtue of the existence
of the synchronization manifold parameterized probabilistic beliefs about external states
and one can unpack that in terms of information geometry and complement a Cartesian dualism
with a Markovian monism but we're not telling that story today. Oh so yes this is just a little
interlude this is one of my postdocs went to America to work with Mike Levin at Tufts and
few months after arriving he and his wife had a little baby and his wife bought him a Markov
blanket so here is Keira the little baby with Franz's Markov blanket here is Markov blanket so if
you Markov so if you if you want a Markov blanket they are available in America. So we've done the
statistics of life and what I promised I would do now is just rehearse exactly the same story
but from the point of view of a neuroscientist trying to understand sentience and how we make
sense of the world. So I'm going to unpack this part of the talk in terms of the basics the
fundamentals of the anatomy of inference in terms of particular coding with a brief focus on
chemical microcircuits and in particular sensory tenuation because I think that's a particularly
important aspect of this physics of sentience particularly in psychiatry and indeed mental
health and then conclude with an illustration of all this in action and my fond hope is to get back
to synchronization and what it means for models of the world where the world includes other things
like me and indeed could include me. So the anatomy of inference all of this is predicated on
the underlying notion that can be traced back to the students of Plato I think most best articulated
by Hermholtz as we see it see in a moment. The notion that perception rests upon a constructive act
it's a perspective on perception which is in contrast 20th century sort of outside in filtering
sensory information it rests upon an inside out constructive act where you construct predictions
or hypotheses that best explain the signals and sensations of your sensory states or your
sensory epithelia. So you have to have something in mind as a potential explanation for your
sensations before you can perceive it. I think this is beautifully illustrated by this painter
famed for doing still life oils that when viewed from a different perspective give you a very
different percept. So if previously you saw a bowl of fruit and now you see a face the key thing is
you brought that face to the table that is your explanation it's this inside out act that now
enables you to find a better explanation a simpler explanation for why you're perceiving or sensing
this particular pattern of sensory signals. So Helmholtz would I think in the science and
the life sciences and the physical sciences be the person who first articulated this most clearly
nicely illustrated by this sentence or quote here objects are always imagined as being present
in the field of vision as would have to be there in order to produce the same impression on the
nervous mechanism. So again speaking to the notion that it is the the impressions you get
on the sensory epithelia are explained by what would happen if this was the cause and the cause
has to be imagined in a mindful way and clearly this is very much akin to Richard Gregory and other
seminal psychologists of the 20th century who formulated perception as a hypothesis testing
again this notion that using sensory evidence sensations sensory states as evidence for or
against a perceptual explanation or hypothesis and if confirmed then you commit to that and that
is what you see as opposed to what you are looking at. These ideas have been used to great effect
in a technical arena in particularly machine learning by people like Jeffrey Hinton and in
a slightly more translational setting by people like Peter Diane and indeed they came up with the
notion of a Helmholtz machine as a machine learning or neural network formulation of this basic idea
boring ideas from Thomas Bayes and in particular Richard Feynman's free energy or variational
solution to the problem of this difficult inference problem that we all face when
finding the best explanations for our sensorium. Let's just go back to Helmholtz producing
impressions on the nervous system so this fits very nicely with this Markovian blanket construct.
So what we're talking about here is if it is the case that to be is to perform gradient flows
on evidence model evidence what I am effectively saying is that I will appear to try and explain
the best explanation or causes for the sensory impressions or the shadows on my sensory states
my sensory veil so I will be trying to discern or represent what is causing these sensory shadows
here and using the maths that I presented in the first half one can sketch out how our brains
actually do this in a relatively straightforward way so these equations again may look complicated
but you know once you get used to them they are remarkably simple and yet may explain how our
brains and our neuronal message passing actually implement this fantastic act of being able to
explain what's causing our sensorium to produce those fantasies that are virally endorsed by
the sensory this our sensory evidence that we gather with our eyes and our ears and all other
organs. So let's just come back to this gradient flow and focus on the internal states so here's
our gradient flow on this log probability under some simplifying assumptions Gaussian assumptions
we can write this expression in this form here which is a mixture of two things the rate of change
my internal states so my neuronal activity can be broken into the solenoidal part which is
in engineering known as a prediction so it's a prediction of what I wouldn't the states of the
world in the future without any observing any new information so nothing is actually changing in
terms of the underlying surprise because it's a prediction about things I haven't yet seen and then
a prediction error epsilon which is the difference between what I predicted
and what I actually observe and this gradient flow basically is just saying we're going to minimize
the sum squared error weighted by their precision pi here so just to try and give you an intuition
of what that sort of how that would work in a sort of coarse-grained fashion let's imagine that we
have this sensory impression here this shadow on our sensory epithelia and we had some expectation
or mean explanation new here that the best explanation was of a howling dog and if I had
a generative model g that could generate from this expectation what I would have seen my
sensory states that would have been produced if this was right then I can compare the prediction
generated by the generative model with the actual sensations and elaborate a prediction error and
then I can simply use my prediction error to optimize or change my expectations until the
prediction error has been minimized and at which point I will have a perfectly good explanation
for my sensory impressions and that changing that Bayesian belief updating that evidence
accumulation is just this gradient flow it's just minimizing prediction error notice that the name
of the game here is to minimize prediction error or to maximize the the probability of the sensory
on the blanket states under a particular model of the world that is generating the predictions
will never actually know what caused these sensations but that's not the point if I can get
through my life minimizing both prediction error job done and of course that job is done by this
gradient flow up here so this provides a nice and parsimonious very simple picture of active
sentience and so we can forget about all the Fokker-Pank equations and the gradient flows
and we can say that we can explain everything in terms of minimizing prediction error
which means that we can understand perception as the changing of internal for example brain states
to supply predictions that are as close as possible to the sensations and that would be
a canonical way of minimizing prediction error and we can regard that as perception changing
predictions however there is another way of minimizing prediction error we could actually
go and resample our sensory states our sensations to make them more like the predictions and this
involves actively soliciting new sensations from the environment by looking over there or by touching
this or touching that and that gives a nice explanation for changing sensations to minimize
prediction error so both action and perception are simply there in the service of minimizing
prediction error so what would that look like in a little brain and I've deliberately chosen
a bird brain here because I want to use bird song as a little simulation at the end just to
illustrate and make concrete some of the phenomena that we've been talking about
so imagine this is a piece of neuroanatomy from a bird brain this is the auditory
thalamus of a songbird it receives some sensations so let's assume that the bird is currently
listening to set for something it receives these fluctuating sonogram representations of sensory
input time frequency and in the absence of any top-down predictions there is with sensations
just to become the prediction error they go up to the higher vocal center for example
where they drive through this gradient flow expectations that try to provide predictions
of what's coming in until such point as the predictions match the input and the prediction
error is quenched or resolved however at the same time while these first order predictions
are fluctuating being driven by the ascending prediction errors they are also in receipt of
top-down predictions from a higher area say area x in the in the songbird's brain and the same
mechanics ensues that there's a difference between the activity here and the top-down prediction
that elaborates a prediction error that's sent forward to give better top-down predictions
on the first-order predictions that generate and try to suppress the first-order prediction errors
and you can see how you can build this hierarchically into a deep generative model of the sort necessary
for inferring what's going to happen next at different temple scales a narrative or in this
instance birdsong and this is a useful explanation for listening and but notice that we've also
included in the things the sensations that have to be predicted the sensations that are reporting
the status of my motor plant in this instance the the voice box of the bird here so the if I
were able to if I was listening then I would I would not be predicting any sensations from
from my articulatory muscles any stretch receptor signals however I can use exactly
the same generative model the same machinery predicted machinery and to actually reproduce
and sing and all I need to do is basically switch on by increasing the precision
or of the descending predictions of what I would feel if I was actually producing this sensory
input and then I would have a difference between my top-down predictions and what I'm actually
sensing from my muscles and I would have a prediction error and I could use that prediction
error to drive my expectations and in fact I wasn't singing or I can send them back outside to the
world and actually cause the muscles to move until they supply the predicted signals so all I've
done here is sketch a computational anatomy that is isomorphic exactly the same as a classical
reflex arc where the way that we move and indeed the way that we secrete in terms of autonomic
action is rests upon top-down predictions providing a set point for classical reflex arcs that these
peripheral prediction errors actually drive and fulfill and all this requires is a sort of yin yang
or a selective gating of whether I am attending to switching on the precision of the prediction
errors pertaining to proprioception to action or extra reception this instance auditory
sensations so this illustrates a very important role of
of precision in contextualizing whether I'm passively listening and not moving or whether I'm
actually generating the sensations actively and implicitly also attenuating the consequences of
my own action sometimes referred to as sensory attenuation technically what we are the story
that we've just told this little predictive coding with reflexes formulation of active inference
is a story about the top-down predictions descending predictions playing the role of
corollary discharge predicting stuff that I'm sensing in the extra receptive domain
and at the same time bilaterally generating predictions of proprioception that are
interpreted as motor commands by the peripheral nervous system and my neuromuscular junctions
from the point of view of the control of precision this is often this mechanism sort of switching
between sensory attenuation and organ and sensory attenuation sensory attention or selection
sometimes interpreted in terms of attention being if you like the psychological homologue
of this sort of precision engineered message passing here I just want to drill down on that
because I'm going to use that in the final couple of slides to simulate dynamic interactions
so just to show you how potent this precision modulation of the prediction errors that we're
trying to use to select the kinds of prediction errors that we want to minimize on that we believe
convey precise information for our belief updating I'm going to play a little game
if you allow me to play this game it's illustrative of one of the clearest
examples of sensory attenuation which is called mechanic suppression but I'll explain
how and why just after illustrating its potency so this is not going to work very well given that
you're all very remote but could you if you are a man do one task and if you're a woman do another
task and the task is as follows in a moment Sherlock Holmes is going to jump from this side of the
screen to the other side of the screen and your job is to tell me whether any aspect of this picture
of Sherlock Holmes changed when it goes from here to here I'd like the women to focus on this
fixation point here in the center so they have to keep their eyes still and tell me whether
Sherlock Holmes changed on Passon whilst fixating on the cross conversely the men I'd like you to
focus on Sherlock Holmes and try and track Sherlock Holmes and what I want to know is who's
the best at being able to detect whether or not anything changed in the picture of Sherlock Holmes
so if you if you can all do that I'm going to pick on Lydia as representative of women to give
me her answer and Tim as representative of men to give me give me the given the men's answer so
Lydia and Tim can you can you focus if you're still there on on this particular little task
right so three two one and then is going to jump three two one
Lydia can you hear me hi yes I can what did you did you think Sherlock Holmes changed in
any aspect well I saw something flash up in the middle oh what did you see I think it said did
you miss me okay that's Tim okay I Tim are you there I'm there I'm here yes I'm afraid I didn't
see anything I didn't know you didn't see anything at all no change in Sherlock Holmes
so beautiful that that is a lovely illustration of the power of saccadic suppression or sense
detenuation in the ocular motor context so what Lydia well done that was you know you only had
about 50 milliseconds to see that but you did indeed see did you miss me and and the idea here
is the reason that you Lydia saw this and was that you were not suppressing the precision of your
visual prediction errors because you weren't moving Tim on the other hand had to suppress
the prediction the visual prediction errors because they were a consequence of its active
sensing or visual palpation of the world so this is a lovely example of enforced sensory attenuation
where we're basically transiently blind or transiently suspender our attention when we
cause the sensations and of course when we move our eyes there is an enormous visual flow or optic
induced simply by our eye movements which we cannot see and in virtue of the fact that Tim
could not see it whilst he was moving his eyes he couldn't see anything else either which is why
you Lydia were the only person that could actually see the did you did you miss me so I think this
is a wonderful example of you know hardwired sensory attenuation that really has a profound
influence of on on how the sensorium updates our belief and how that depends exquisitely
on agency and action and what I want to do now is just to close by leveraging sensory attenuation
and augmentation that underwrites whether I'm whether I'm listening or talking or whether I'm
listening or singing to simulate now dyadic interaction so previously we've been talking
and simulating little creatures inter exchanging with the external world what I'm doing now
was making a further move and putting two Markov blankets face to face as it were so the internal
states of one blanket are the external states of another blanket in the hope of simulating dyadic
interactions but to do that to preserve the conditional independences I have to do turn
taking and I'm going to use this precision mechanism to turn take so one in this instance
is going to be a bird is listening and then it's singing and then it's listening and then it's singing
and vice versa for the other bird so when we integrate those equations let the birds sing
and when we integrate those equations of motion that predictive coding equation with the prediction
and the gradient the prediction and minimization part of a neuro of a neurobiologically
plausible sort for the generative model that I've just described for singing and listening
we can simulate what would happen if two birds were singing in the same locale
what I've done here is separate the two birds so that they can't hear each other
so what you're listening to now is what one bird is actually hearing it can't hear itself
so it can hear itself and it can't hear the other bird and then now simply going to repeat
the simulation but bringing the two birds within hearing range of each other so now they can hear
each other and then I'm going to track the internal states at different levels in this
synthetic cortical hierarchy that are providing the predictions and the prediction errors for
the song that you've just heard and now if we listen to what is perceived by the first bird
you can now hear a continuous melody and this melody is composed of itself singing and then
hearing the other bird then itself and the other bird and in contrast to the previous slide
what we're seeing here is a synchronization and this synchronization ensues because both birds
have the same generative model they both have the same beliefs about what's out there and in
this instance what's out there is exactly the same as itself which means that this is a really
powerful way to minimize surprise or prediction error in the sense that
if you are like me and we are in exchange then you become very predictable from my point of view
because anything that I do you are doing and vice versa and this holds for you as well so
dyadically or together we can now minimize our free energy or minimize our prediction error
simply because where we are committing to the same narrative to the same sensory states and
active states that generate the sensorium and our sensorium is shared and it's mutually predictable
simply because I can assume that you are like me and under that assumption and when two things
are sufficiently similar and they can learn mutually to be sufficiently similar then we
see the emergence again of the synchronization manifold so here in a different context but it's
mathematically exactly the same construct that we that we looked at with the simulations the
primordial soup what I've done is tracked out the brain activity if you like the neural activity
generating predictions when the two birds couldn't hear each other at the different levels in this
synthetic cortical hierarchy and then exactly the same neural activity patterns when they can
hear each other just to show you how they align how they become synchronized and because we now
know that it couldn't be in it it couldn't be in any other way in the sense that these this is the
kind of coupling that is the non-equilibrium steady state or it is this attracting set of states that
must emerge very much like Huygens clocks so that's an illustration of synchronization in terms of
communication and this is a very elemental communication literally singing from the same
hint sheet in order to be able to infer a very elemental if you like theory of mind the the
last slide is really an invitation to think about what that means for the way that we learn our
generative models of the world to exploit this free energy minima this this prediction error
solution in a world that is populated constitutes creatures like me I can assume that every
creature like me is like me and we're all seeing from the same him sheet but to get there I have to
learn that the world out there comprises creatures like me so here is the challenge for a newborn
first of all the newborn has to distinguish between the things that it can act upon and the things
that he has no control over in order to develop a sense a generative model that enables it to
recognize those reflexes and parts of the world can be controlled and can't be controlled but the
even greater challenge then is to recognize and to learn by this surprise minimizing free energy
minimizing prediction error mechanism applied to the connections and the structure and the parameters
of the generative model to learn that the best explanation for its sensorium is a fact that many
of the sensations are supplied by something else another and in particularly a mother that is
something like me which will be the final the final stage and the very elemental
sort of simplistic sense of learning that there are things like me out there
so having developed a sense of mother then one might suppose that a neonate might test then the
hypothesis or perhaps I am like mother and thereby leading to a sense of self so in a rather cursory
way I've managed to get to the what was promised in the introduction from Peter about agency and a
sense of self but in a way really which is more an invitation to interpret discuss whether the
underlying physics of sentience really makes sense in terms of speaking to these fundamental
questions about selfhood and relationships with others I'll end with a quote from Feynman it's
usually a technical quote but I thought this would be more appropriate in given in the current
context the highest forms of understanding we can achieve our laughter and human compassion
and with that it just remains for me to thank all the people whose ideas I've been talking about
and most importantly thank you for your attention thank you very much indeed and I'm
going to pass now back to Peter. Thank you thank you so much Carl I've been monitoring some of the
comments in between and if I could just cite to you a few enlightening lecture thank you
this is so interesting and brilliantly explained so I've got some questions but just to say
in kind of try and do a little bit of translation what is remarkable about your
view is really that it's like the picture that you should you've turned perception upside down in
the kind of active inference framework that there is that the traditional notion of perception
and action and everything between is not a kind of the endpoint of a whole
long line of processing but really something that we generate from inside and then
compare without that and those of us here working clinically and a number of questions
from that perspective have learned this all along we have you're not telling us anything new you've
known this that the people just interpret that world and you know they try and minimize prediction
error and they change the world until the prediction error is minimized and
and some of that has very painful consequences in some way it has distressing
consequences in psychopathology and one of the questions and there'll be more technical
questions one of the questions that people really want you to address just a little bit because I
know that you have done is how would you brilliant your model is how would you
see mental disorder how would you see psychopathologies in terms of prediction error
and is there a risk which I don't think there is but I think it could be the reassurance
that is there a risk that some sorts of innate disruption in minimizing prediction errors could
be at the root of mental disorder or is that a consequence of
historical experience in terms of consequence of personal experience
but do you go excellent question and so just speaking to this sort of you know turning things
on their head it is I think a nice example of what dandenek calls a strange inversion but clearly
not strange to you and people actually work with with people but for some people in machine learning
and artificial intelligence it's certainly a strange inversion but much more natural for
people work with actually also real artifacts of artificial sorting robotics but the deeper I
think more challenging question which I'm sure we'll drill down to is you know where does this
mechanics yield some interesting hypotheses about false inference and the concomitant behaviors
that attend or belief states that attend false inference that we see in psychopathology of its
various flavors and I think you've you've carved up the answer into two domains already which is
part of it is this false inference in the moment what leads what's what's the
the first principle account of a false belief or indeed a false percept
in the moment and then there's the other questions which are more about the learning
of the gerentive models so there's the deployment of a gerentive model inverting it in the moment
given the sensory evidence given all the evidence from your interception from your
pro-social interactions at hand to use your gerentive model to infer what's going on at the moment
and you know how I can sample or create new information to make my predictions come true
as opposed to in a developmental or indeed actually in any experience dependent setting
the updating of the parameters the contingencies the lawful aspects the structure of that
gerentive model that would underwrite you know the emergence of a sense of agency attachment
possibly a description of you know the development of a dadic relationship over
over you know days months weeks and years so in the first domain there's a really
practical answer and it just comes from the empiricism that you know one can find in
academic psychiatry and academic neurology when one looks at the the process there is a neuronal
process there is that mediate this gradient flow then it seems that the both the the nature of
false inference the psychopathology if you like and the neurophysiology almost universally
identifies a failure of that precision so it's a failure of that sensory attenuation that we
were illustrating with the circadian suppression but at a much higher level so whether you're
talking about Parkinson's disease failure to attenuate proprioceptive information that I'm
not moving I'm therefore never being able to develop the fantasy that I'm moving leading to
psychomotor poverty or whether it's the hallucinosis volcanic psychosyndromes
or indeed schizophrenia where you or perhaps the poster child here would be autism
where you are unable to modulate or attenuate the precision afforded sensory evidence so you
become glued to the sensorium you fail to develop deep centrally coherent generated models of your
world you cannot discontent nothing is surprising because nothing everything is is worthwhile
predicting so you can't have illusions you can't have mismatched negativities all ball responses
all cardinal signs of you know of things like schizophrenia so you put that failure of sensory
attenuation in a developmental context and just ask what it must be like to be born into a world
that you're trying to make sense of you know and all your sensing is possibly a rattle or suckling
or nurturing behaviour or filletive touch from your mother and you're trying to make sense of the
world but you can't discontent from anything to actually drill down and start to build a deep model
that provides a parsimonious explanation of the kind our mother is a creature she is an object
out there that's doing stuff to me I cause this bit and she calls that bit so you know then the
game gets ex exquisitely difficult in terms of understanding the profound implications of a failure
to suspend your attention in a in a in an apt way to realise your agency or disambiguate
I cause that or you cause that I mean there is a finding that originally John Watson
brought forward to the developmental world that babies up to the age of about three months
attend with preference things that are perfectly contingent with their actions after three months
they prefer to attend to things that are clearly but clearly not perfectly contingent nearly
contingent but not perfectly contingent and that autistic children do not have this switch
at the three month switch would this be consistent with what you're suggesting yes it would I didn't
know that that's fascinating I mean you know if I if I had to build a baby in silico that's exactly
what one would hope would happen in the normal development you've got to learn what bits of
this world you know can I act upon and what bits can't you know that's that that's the first thing
that you need to do to just the self-discovery without any sense of selfhood per se but then
you get to the more interesting bits well you know I thought I could control this but perhaps
there's another agent's out there and then you start to you know get it find that much more
epistemically attractive it has much more epistemic affordance these things I thought I could
control but in fact someone else might be out there yeah well let me try and squeeze another
question so enlightening lecture thank you I'm a psychologist working with parents
who struggle to relate to their kids who engage in very high-risk behaviors part of the issue is
that often parents overreact emotionally feeding into the behavior staying calm and acting
counteratively is a challenge so thinking about the mark of blanket model where would
you start with these parents not an easy question it's not because I was immediately trying to
answer it as a psychiatrist and as a mathematician all that this very simple minded treatment of
dadic interactions brings to the table is the the notion of generalized synchronization between
you and your loved ones or you and your clients or you and your and your patients which would
basically says that to have a harmonious aligned interaction you have to be in a like-minded
singing from the same hymn sheet so if you are at all that hymn sheet covers all modalities from
interception from verbal non-verbal cues but the synchronization the alignment is still in play
even to the level you can measure it in terms of your body movements blushing for example
pupillary dilatation all of these subliminal cues that tell you about the state of your embodied brain
are mutually available and the trick would be I would imagine to try and synchronize them so
just on that mathematical basis you have to put yourself in the same state of mind as the child
in the fond hope that the child will reciprocate by putting themselves in the same state of mind
as you one little trick here is that the weight the weight at which the rate at which two couple
systems converge to their common ground depends upon the precision or the confidence in the
predictions of the two so there's an asymmetry there you can often get a teacher or a parent or
a therapist who has more if you like precise beliefs higher in their model that will move
towards the less precise Markov blanket or client or child but will move less quickly than the child
moves to the parent and clearly you see that in a natural setting just in terms of schooling
it's generally the case that the teacher is older than the child and the teacher is more
confident about what the child knows but at some point there is a meeting in the middle but it's
not always in the middle so that was a really stupid answer but at least it was faithful to
the mathematics one final question to test that breath that I was boosting on your behalf
and here is I'm sorry could a problem in the stability or structuring in the Markov blanket
be thought of as a failure or weakness of psychic defense and would the introduction of entropy
or dissolution point to links with Freud's ideas of the death instinct?
Yes I mean there are all sorts of what really interesting ways you could take that question
in terms of structural learning you know but let me focus on you know on the Freudian
interpretation or homologues here and I think you know if there is part of the audience that
likes this to understand the parallels and the homologies and isomorphisms between your Freudian
take on free energy and the more mathematical Richard Feynman take on it then Mark Soames is
your man you know he's written beautifully about this and would normally start the story by noting
that Freudian formulations inherited quite a lot from Helmholtz so you know had Freud known Feynman
and had you know tried to develop Helmholtzian ideas it's more than likely his free energy would
be the same as that used by people like Geoffrey Hinton and Richard Feynman and the interestingly
when when Mark Soames goes into this in great detail he actually converges on the same thing
that we were talking about before which is this precision that the you know I'm not sure that we
in this we don't have time to get to to eager dissolution and the like but one important
autopoetic aspect that maintains the integrity of the Markov blanket is exactly this attending
and disattending it's selective and appropriate switching on and off of how the sensory states
get in and influence the internal states and then vicariously your actions upon the world
if that breaks everything falls to pieces and that certainly is Mark Soames's story
based upon sort of you know a sort of a theoretical neuropsychology based upon the importance of
ascending modulating neurotransmission systems for example dopamine and the like but not just
dopamine all these classical neuromodulators because if it's the physiological
mediation of this precision control is via selecting selection and per-snapting game which
is neuromodulation so it's not surprising that a lot of the neurochemistry of and the pharmacology
of psychopathology fixes upon these neuromodulators and furthermore this is exactly
Mark Soames's conclusion in terms of the the failure to resolve free energy
lives you know the seat of the soul is essentially the source of origin of the ascending
modulating neurotransmitter systems that are exactly there to provide this gating attenuation
selection behaviour that that preserves the Markov blanket in the sense that we've been discussing.
Can't this is an absolutely brilliant lecture you are everything that I have advertised you to be
it is obviously a revelation but a revelation in the direction of helping us understand
sociality helping us understand how ultimately the brain and our capacity to
create a create a world that's consistent with our hypothesis actually falls into
a continuum that we are living every day in but as you said in a very strange as a very strange
function of time as a very strange function of time and it's to have a mind like yours that
actually can bridge the obtuse writings of psychoanalysts with the cutting edge writings of
physicists and the neuroscientists in between and whilst maintaining an identity as a somebody who's
concerned with mental health you are a remarkable human being you really are and we are enormously
privileged to have had you here this evening and to be able to benefit from your wisdom so
thank you so much for joining us thank you thank you thank you so much
