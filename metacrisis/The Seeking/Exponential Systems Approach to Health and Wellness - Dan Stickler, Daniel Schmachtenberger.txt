We're fast approaching the age of the superhuman and we're doing this by transcending the bounds
of evolution.
So buckle up and prepare to enter the world of the Iron Man Executive with Dr. Daniel
Stickler.
We'll explore the limitless human potential for cutting edge science, new technologies
and medical advancement.
Here is your host, Dr. Daniel Stickler.
Welcome back to this edition of the Iron Man Executive.
I'm Dr. Dan and as usual we have another really exciting and educational show coming
up for you.
I do want to reiterate a lot of the stuff that we've been talking about about all the exciting
things that have been happening at the Appearance Center for Human Potential where we have recently
launched the Appearance Academy that's A-P-E-I-R-O-N dot academy not a dot com but dot academy.
You can go there, check out all the new courses that we're teaching now in epigenetics.
We're actually having a certification in epigenetic coaching.
This is about 120 hours of training and most of that is done by me.
I also have some really amazing coaches that are going to be teaching this with me, coaches
that are tops in their field in the realm of coaching, tops in their field in the realm
of business development for health coaches, health and wellness.
If you are an existing health and wellness coach, a physician, a chiropractor, a nutritional
therapist, a dietitian or somebody who just wants to get into health coaching because
you have a huge passion for it, go on and check this out because this will take you
to a whole new level.
Coaching is the new paradigm of medicine and after you hear the intro on that website
you will be convinced plus we have a lot of fun in creating this tribe so be sure to check
it out.
Now you heard me talk last week about essentially an affiliate partnership that we have developed
with Neurohacker Collective.
This is a company that manufactures the Neurohacker Qualia brain supplementation and I tell you
the stuff is really out of this world.
It truly does exactly what you expect it to do and it really is just taking the brain
to a whole new level of optimization.
We found this after I had referred several patients to it to try it out because it really
had a mix of nutrients that I said this is really the real deal.
It led down the road to several conversations with the company and eventually I had some
conversations with Daniel Schmockenberger who is one of the founders and the guy is
absolutely fascinating so I asked him to come on the podcast and to talk about the whole
Neurohacker Collective and a little bit about the Qualia product and he agreed to do so.
This is an interview that is really out of this world.
Daniel, I don't even venture to give a good intro to Daniel because anything I try to
do as far as a bio will really not do justice to who Daniel Schmockenberger is.
What I did is I asked him to kind of tell us about himself and about the company and
their mission in the intro to this interview and I can tell you he is someone who takes
an entire systems approach to absolutely everything.
In our medical practice we use a systems approach to health and wellness and it's this whole
interaction of all these systems involved.
He takes that to a whole new level of not only health and wellness but to business,
to commerce, to life in general and you're going to be blown away by this interview.
So sit back and have a listen.
Alright, so I've got a great guest with us today.
His name is Daniel Schmockenberger and he has agreed to come on and talk to us about
various topics but most importantly we want to focus on the company that is part of his
vision and some of the products that they have but let's start off Daniel talking about
who you are.
Give us some background and a little bit about what makes you you.
Very open question.
So I think a meaningful place to start is I was fortunate to be home educated as a kid
in a way that was kind of an educational experiment that my parents wanted to run which was what
happens if you give a kid no curriculum at all, expose them to everything you can, see
what they're interested in and facilitate the interests.
So I didn't have a fixed amount of social studies and English and etc.
And what was really interesting about that of course it means that there are certain
things that are part of normal general education that I wasn't interested in and just didn't
get so my handwriting is illegible, my spelling is bad but I dove very deeply into all the
sciences early on and I didn't even think of them as separate divisions because the
division between biology and chemistry and physics are useful for us for trying to create
curriculum but obviously universe is radically integrated and you have causal arrows pointing
in up and down directions and so studying it that way it was just the study of how universe
works and so all the areas of science, all of the philosophic disciplines that created
context for maybe why is science that way, why is the nature of reality the way that
it is and then all the different areas of activism, how can we understand the nature
of reality better so we can participate in alleviating suffering, making a higher quality
of life experience possible for everyone and so that braid of activism, science and philosophy
is kind of core to who I am and all of the various endeavors fit within it.
Yeah and that's why I wanted to bring that up because looking at your background I mean
you have very diverse kind of entrepreneurial background and activism background, can you
tell us about some of the projects that came from that?
Yeah so working in activism early on this was everything from ecological work to civil
rights work to animal rights work and one of the things that I saw also having a background
in interdisciplinary science ended up leading fortunately to a background in system science
understanding how seemingly different things actually fit together into self-organizing
holes into whole systems and so taking a system science approach to activism I saw okay here's
an area where we're trying to say protect an animal from poaching and the answer is
say it was an elephant we're gonna put bigger fences around the preserves and create harsher
sentencing for poachers but we're not addressing the underlying poverty of the people that
can't meet their needs any other way adequately other than poaching we're not addressing the
value system and why it's conditioned that way towards animals we're not addressing macroeconomics
that leads to poverty we're not addressed like there's so many things aren't being addressed
that if we succeed at getting the fences up then the poachers move to some other animal
somewhere else or you know some other problem and so starting to look at what would it take
to actually meaningfully address all of the things that need addressed from a systems
point of view what would a whole systems design upgrade for humanity look like so relatively
early on that became my primary inquiry and so this was maybe we actually can't change the
future of education to be optimal education that brings forth the the full potential and
capability of humans if we don't change macroeconomics to where we're not having to prepare those
kids for a workforce in the way that we are now but we're preparing them for a different
macroeconomic structure where the facilitation of their unique genius capabilities is you know is
supported in terms of the system they're coming into etc right so start looking at what is the
future of macroeconomics what's the future of governance what's the future of education of
health care that are optimum factoring the interconnectivity of all of those things upgrading
so this was the beginning of starting a think tank that then worked with a number of other
leading-edge think tanks on the topic of fundamental restructure of civilization in
ways that could prevent current problems that really must be prevented catastrophic and existential
risks that otherwise have too high of a probability currently that could address the
underlying causes of so much of the unnecessary human induced suffering and that could produce
highest quality of life for the highest potential quality of life for all life and so then it's
just really been a refinement of this process of what really needs to happen and how do we go
about doing that and for a while I worked with large NGOs and companies and trying to implement
some of the ideas through there through those vehicles until realizing that those vehicles
really couldn't do the things that were necessarily the groups that were working on hunger
were quite happy to address starvation in in areas of extreme poverty by bringing industrial
agriculture to the area to be able to create more food production there even if that meant more
nitrogen runoff leading to faster dead zones in the ocean because those weren't the metrics they
were tasked with and it doesn't mean they were really happy it just means that the nature of
here's the metrics you're tasked with and they are they are interconnected with other things but
that's not there the focus of how that interconnectivity is addressed is just outside of the macro
systems that you know those structures are part of and so eventually you said all right well
let's just actually look at how to build things from scratch that can obsolete the things that need
obsolete it and that's you know there's a reason behind why I wanted you to go into that story
I've we've talked previously and and I know the story and I've read some background on it
but it's also one of the approaches we use in our new paradigm of medicine of human potential
medicine where we look at this entire biospherical approach so we look at the interactions of
all aspects of the human being including environmental interactions and sleep stress
thoughts brain function all of that so you've taken this into just this amazing think-take
process and here's here's what I'm leading to is the the creation of neurohacker collective
that neurohacker collective actually came from this this think tank and I think that's just
fascinating the way that the the organization I think a lot of people will look at neurohacker
and they'll see the quality of product and they'll think oh they're a supplement company but
that's far from even close to what neurohacker collective is two things one is you said the
approach that we were describing for civilization design and the approach that you advocate for
medicine are very related they are very related because the human body and the human mind body
environment system is a complex system and so if you try and do you know reductionist parts-based
approach it just it works for acute things it doesn't work for complex things and so
all right there is too much LDL so we're going to give a statin but we didn't really ask why
there's too much LDL and what the externalities side effects of the statin are going to be and
you know that approach just doesn't work for complex illness and it doesn't work for comprehensive
wellness optimization so you have to say across all of the different body systems so there are ways
that the gut affects the brain yes through the enteric nervous system through the microbiota
through you know so the division between neurology and gastroenterology we just can't
you can't maintain specialism across those boundaries you can't maintain specialism
across the genetic bottom-up organization and the connectomic top-down organization because
they're influencing each other in real time and so you look at the body as a whole complex
adaptive system regulatory system and then you say our goal is to increase the resilience
of the entire system the homeostatic capacity of the whole system how do we go about doing that and
to see disease as where some deviations from homeostasis exceeded the homeostatic capacity
of the system leading to pathophysiology and how do we then bring that back and you know restore
system resilience when we're looking at an ecosystem or we're looking at human civilization
systems there are also complex adaptive systems where the goal similarly the economics and the
environment are inter-affecting each other inexorably right the all the social systems
governance law and our inter-affecting infrastructure and so you have to say well again what would a
really resilient system look like and it's not going to look like exponential growth of a materials
economy on a finite planet it's just no way that could ever be resilient right it's not going to
look like for-profit a military industrial complex while trying to create peace or for-profit sick
care while trying to create health was not going to look like places where the incentives are
misaligned with the goals and so you say well what would a really resilient system look like
and so very like why humanitarian aid why all of our approaches to peace and security and
global problem solving haven't been working is the exact same reason allopathic medicine
doesn't work for complex issues is I mean we very much have an allopathic system of governance
that is dealing with symptoms rather than causes dealing with things as
separate issues that really are interconnected issues so you know we apply the same systems for
looking at medicine in the body because they are complex systems optimization now why we started
focusing on bringing forward solutions for future of well-being science which would include what we've
called medicine in the past how to move from disease states to wellness states but also how to
maintain and optimize and continuously evolve states of higher and higher well-being higher
and higher system resilience and we're starting not in the medicine space but in the optimization
space with neurohacker collective and specifically in the mind-brain space how do we optimize the
mind-brain interface for optimally sovereign humans humans whose agency whose intelligence
whose sentience are all you know evolving and interconnectedly evolving the reason why that
is one of the critical things that has to happen for all of the meaningful shifts that have to
happen on the planet-wide level is that when we look at all of the problems that we want to change
whether we're talking about violence you know at a crime level or violence at a war level
or violence against nature at a biodiversity loss level or like all of those issues that we're trying
to address are caused by human behavior and all of the solutions we want to bring about have to
come from human behavior so then the question becomes what are all the things that influence human
behavior and that can influence it in destructive or constructive directions and obviously economics
influences human behavior if you create an economic system where war is profitable or an economic
system where a whale is worth a million dollars dead on a fishing boat but is worth nothing alive
that economic system predisposes destructive behavior so you need to change economics to
incentivize for any agent that which is also positive for all other agents in the comments
that is a radically different system of macroeconomics so economics and social systems as a whole
influence behavior environment influences behavior our psychology and our definition of success and
self-implants behavior so does our physiology and everyone who has ever felt shitty when they were
sick or had a hangover or hormones or neurotransmitters were out of balance or just had a headache knows
that there are certain states of consciousness that are just inaccessible when your physiology is
off and other ones that are almost unavoidable that affect your experience and your behavior
and the same is true when your system is more in tune and so realizing that empathy runs on
certain neural networks in the brain that consciousness is running on the hardware of
physiology and if the hardware of physiology is damaged or just down-regulated or out of tune
that there are whole aspects of of experience and behavior that are just either down-regulated
or not possible and the question of how do we optimize physiology for optimal human experience
and behavior right people who have complex problem solving have high emotional resilience have high
you know agency etc so that they have the predispositions and capability to really be assets
to the balance sheet of nature rather than liability yeah and you know the this whole
complex interactive aspect i mean you you focused in on allopathic medicine but i see it in functional
medicine as well i mean i think the the whole system has come down to treating the human being
as a disease state there isn't this this option for optimization in the medical communities right
now and you know that's our driving force is to create that that option for people who say you
know what we're not really broken and how can we how can we optimize this system to take us to a
new level of existence a new level of functioning not in a hedonistic way but in a in a kind of
eudaimonic way to bring the the whole population into this into this new realm um josh medaldorf a
friend of mine um who i interviewed on the on this show is he wrote the book cracking the aging
code and he compared the current medical paradigm to you know hearing the call of a man overboard
and you run and you see a guy thrashing in the water and you're throwing life preservers to him
and he's not reaching for them and you can keep throwing them but he's never going to reach for
them because it's a it's a system that's that's broken that you can't fix no matter how hard you
try so i think you know there is a role for that disease model aspect but you know we're
with the advances we have i mean this is something that we need this new approach to
and you know you've you've ventured into this realm with the neuro hacker collective the the
qualia product that you have created with that is just an amazing product to optimize uh human
function yeah so we talk about the future of well-being science more than we talk about the
future of medicine because medicine is the system of uh how do we deal with illness and of course
once illness is there our well-being science system already failed our goal is to maintain and
optimize and evolve well-being and then of course there there will be times where some
thing happens right there's some deviation from homeostasis that's beyond the system's capacity
and so we come in to help bring you know help resolve it but the goal is recognizing that it's
actually the system's own self-organization that is what makes the person better it's just now
what things do we help supply the system with so it can do that so coming to uh jumping forward and
if if it's interesting to get into how we define health and well-being how we define illness how
we define aging we can do that in pretty formal ways that are useful so we can come back to that
okay the goal qualia specifically was it's the first product that we brought to the market
as a kind of well-being enhancement support and specifically well-being enhancement in the direction
of increasing quality of subjective experience and certain aspects of performance capability that
are aligned with what people would traditionally think of associated with cognitive enhancement
but take it a step up we think of what we call sovereignty enhancement we define sovereignty
in a bigger way than i think most people are used to thinking of it we define sovereignty as the
product of three orthonormal vectors xyz axis so one of them is intelligence one is sentience
one is agency so intelligence is one's ability to process all kinds of information so critical
thinking and systemic thinking and total body of knowledge and memory focus information speed of
processing is all things associated with intelligence sentience is one's depth and
subtlety and robustness of uh feeling right of sensing of experiencing so empathy and mindfulness
and awareness of self and other you know all those things live in sentience and then agency is
one's ability to maintain their integrity as an individual and then act in the universe and act
in the universe functionally so will drive responsibility follow through all those things
so if you think of those three as xyz axes and you think of kind of whichever the shortest one is
defines volume of a sphere we're trying to grow that sphere and uh so when you think of the fact
that you know and you know very well someone's certain hormones being out of balance certain
neurotransmitters certain cell energy dynamics being out of balance can absolutely affect people's
will and drive can affect their empathy their proprioception their mindfulness can affect their
cognition you know various aspects of it so addressing the physiology of it is not sufficient
we also have to address the psychology of it and the you know what we kind of think of as the human
software side but the human hardware side is necessary and so then we're saying what can we do
to support the underlying aspects of human physiology that are involved in all of those
to optimize uh and evolve human sovereignty so quality is the first thing we brought to market
to support those processes and you know it was several years of r&d where we were doing personalized
versions of that in clinical settings i'm sure similar to how you do and then realizing that
when we're looking at when we were looking at complex you know blood chemistry genomes etc
there were some things that were very different from one person to the next and how to bring that
kind of personalized well-being science to masses is is in our goal set but there were many things
that were common across most people that were key to systems optimization and those were the early
products were able to start developing well the thing that really impressed me about this i mean
you know we're we do epigenetics and we do nutrigenomics in our practice and you know this is
basically a bottle full of uh of nutrigenomic modifiers i had looked into developing a powder
that included some of this stuff but what excited me was when i'm reading through this i mean you
you had taken what was the concept in my mind and taken it to just a whole new level with
with what you put in this stuff and it was not only a combination of product but the actual
dosages which you rarely see in supplements at dosage levels that are equivalent to what the
research is actually showing i mean when i saw acetyl alcarnatine at 800 milligrams algal dha at
200 milligrams even bucopaminari which is one of my favorite supplements at 300 milligrams benphitiamine
mucuna to help boost dopamine in the brain all of these things were just really impressive for me
to to see that even adding the the urodine to the supplement in order to help with the
choline utilization boost choline i mean you just don't see that in supplements and it was exciting
to see this and when i started recommending it to my clients and i hadn't even taken it yet
they were reporting back to me how outstanding they felt on this stuff i have to say there's
one thing though that i would love to see in it and it's holy basil which if i could say there was
one thing that would make this thing just perfect it would be holy basil the process of how we developed
it was actually really fun i think you'll appreciate so we started from a kind of cognitive science
point of view of saying all right so what are all of these subjective states and capabilities
cognitive and you know other neurologically related capabilities that we're wanting to
affect for people here and that people are wanting when they go to say energy drinks or off-label
smart drugs or whatever and so we we modeled that out it has to do with short-term memory
and speed of memory and long-term memory and verbal fluency and digit span and arithmetic
processing and analytic thinking and synthetic thinking and creativity and focus and attention
span you know all of those cognitive metrics and things like drive and emotional resilience
with increased presence and subjective flow state and so it's very important to get that right first
because if you have just a subset of it you're seeking to optimize the subset of that it'll
usually be at the cost of some of the other important metrics so this is what's so commonly
reported when someone is using a smart drug like Adderall for off-label purposes they'll increase
a part of their dopamine pathway without the rest of the aspects of their dopamine pathway
or any of the other neurotransmitter or other you know kind of key neurologic pathways sets that
they do have increased say focus but maybe at the cost of other important cognitive metrics like
aspects of memory and processing and definitely at the cost of you know say the ability for task
switching which can lead to more aggravation your ability anxiety and then of course you also have
the ability to I mean if you use a exogenous override of an endogenous regulatory system
then you're going to decrease the regulatory capacity of that system i.e dependence down
regulation and addiction and so our goal was how do we work through the endogenous pathways
sets that if someone used this for some period of time and then stopped rather than be down
regulated and addicted they would actually have their baseline elevated and so we're really supporting
you know endogenous regulatory capacity so we started with modeling all right here's all
the things we're wanting to affect subjectively performatively then we went through all the
literature of all the various sciences that we could and said what do we know across all the
sciences of which aspects of physiology mediate and relate to those aspects of psychology and so
you know if we're talking about memory there's as you know there's a lot that we know about
acetylcholine about glutamate about catecholamines about specific receptor sites about specific
kinds of synaptic processes so we started modeling all of that out to develop the whole
interconnected set of underlying physiology that we'd want to be up regulating and then the whole
regulatory pathways associated to say we're wanting to up regulate these biosystems right
and obviously that's going to get all the way to the whole system but in a weighted fashion
and then we looked at what chemistries map to being able to support those systems and we got
a list of 500 or so chemicals that we had a lot of data on and then we started looking at which ones
are safe across the other systems you know have good safety data which ones have synergistic
effects across multiple systems and then we paired it down to that particular 42 ingredients and
those specific doses and the doses for some things seem high compared to other supplements
sometimes they seem lower than someone would want but it's it's on purpose because say you're looking
at the mucuna for the eldopa well we've got dlpa so you've got the phenylalanine which will be
converting into tyrosine and then acetyltyracine and then eldopa and then dopamine so if you look
at the fact that we've got the phenylalanine, anacetyltyracine and eldopa and the you know p5p
that's part of the conversion process and some of the other minerals and vitamins are part of
the conversion process and then things that are going to support synaptic transporter proteins
endogenous maob inhibitors things that will sensitize d1 d2 receptors you can't use the same
dose of each of those things that were effective in isolation when you start having synergies
across the whole pathway so we started really looking at how do we have you know the effective
doses for optimizing flow through pathways and then interaction between pathways like dopamine with
the rest of catecholamines with acetylcholine and glutamate with the underlying cell energy
processes and and then deeper things like neurogenesis and synaptogenesis with regard to holy basil
holy basil is a beautiful herb obviously adaptogenically especially for ubiquitous
adrenal stress you'll notice that we have the phosphatidylserine which has many of the similar
effects in terms of uh hpa adaptogenic effects on you know serotonin acth etc we actually found
enough people that did not respond well to holy basil that it didn't make it in that were the
kinds of people that were looking for the effects primarily that we'd have here that it didn't make
it in this final cup but it was definitely used in many of the versions and we will have products
coming out that will include it yeah one of the the the aspect i like about holy basil is that
the neuroplasticity and the bdnf increases that you get with the holy basil and that's
that's that's been my finding with it in clinical practice as well i mean it's anecdotal but
the cool thing about it is it raises it causes increased expression of fndc5 in the muscle
which goes to the liver and gets converted to iris and which goes to the brain and boost bdnf
which is the main purpose that we typically focus in on with the with the holy basil but
i love this this whole approach that you have with looking at enhancing existing systems without
supplanting the system and i think that's that's where a lot of medicine has gone awry is that
in medicine we focus and even in in wellness in general i mean we focus on trying to supplant
the body's a beautiful system the body is an amazingly complex system that for us to even
have the concept that we can micromanage it is is just mind-blowing and so even with with like all
these antioxidants that people take i mean come on we're we're producing uh what one times 10 to
the 24th free radicals a day and you think that taking vitamin c in these high doses is going
to make that big of a difference in that system is just ludicrous i mean you look at it and you
say well it's not that the system's broken it's not the free radicals are bad i mean we produce
free radicals for a good reason so what we need to do is boost the body's management capabilities
of that so boost the system that actually handles it give it that that little kick to say hey i'm
going to keep you in a healthy state so that you can do this rather than me trying to micromanage
it and i love that the way you've done that with this product yeah so there you know if you say how
do we can giving glutathione have benefit for people totally does boosting endogenous glutathione
production have more benefit obviously then is there an excessive need on glutathione as a whole
because of you know some increased toxic exposure or something that we could address or or you know
chronic subclinical pathogens that we can do things to help of course so it's it is a very
deep and nuanced thing i i think the thing that i like you know i i really love hearing you say is
the the respect and reverence for the intelligence of the body and nature and universe rather than
it's it's a dumb system and so we have to fix it you know when you mention 10 to the 24th free
radicals per day and what is what do we really think it means to manage that when we think about
trillion metabolic functions per second per cell give or take right and the and the synchrony of
all those right there is just radical parallel processing happening every cell having its own
internal processing dynamics that then are interacting and not just every cell but every
organelle every all the way down to you know the the fundamental physics of it and so there is no
way to top down manage that in fact we can mathematically prove it right we can prove
that it is a that it is an NP complete issue that is non-computable so then we say well how do we
support those endogenous regulatory systems and that is a very different approach to well-being
science you're listening to the iron man executive with dr. Daniel Stoeckler be sure to check out the
ironman executive.com website for free offers bonus materials and extended interviews now back to the
ironman executive show. I want to shift gears a little bit because I wanted to get to this during
this interview but talking about most of my listeners are major biohackers they're all about
you know trying different things the n equals one approach and I don't actually prefer that term
biohacking I prefer optimizing human potential in in that regard biohacking just seems almost in that
hedonic realm but you guys use the the term neurohacking and where do you see this this
neurohacking going I mean what's the what's the future process of neurohacking that you see.
So there's two quick little philosophic things you mentioned a couple times that the goal of
future of medicine is not purely hedonic or the future of optimization that old split between
haton and daemon is actually one of the nonsense things we have to dichotomies we have to reconcile
so when we talked about optimizing human experience and human capability having a underlying
philosophic model that shows that the way that people contribute to the whole is actually
optimal for their own quality of life experience and as their quality of life goes up it increases
their capacity and predisposition to contribute to the whole very much in the same way that a cell
relates to the whole body right the way that human relates to humanity and to universe and so
we would not throw out hedonism we would include and transcend it right and I think when you said
eudaimonia that's a good word for include and transcend that people's own experience their
experiential tone being optimized is absolutely useful for then optimizing their capability
and predisposition for serving meaningfully and vice versa without deep meaningful service there
are qualities of personal subjective experience that just don't happen and so I just I just wanted
to mention that real quick the interview I did just just two weeks ago with Steve Cole who is a
psychoneuroimmunologist at UCLA he did a study on hedonism versus eudaimonic well-being and it
blew me away they went into the study him and Barbara Friedrichson went into the study thinking
you know they're going to see similar outcomes of positive physiological responses and they found
that the on the psychological scales the hedonics and the eudaimonic scored equally well on well
being scores but then when they looked at the health of the immune system they started looking
deeper into these epigenetic marks and and blood biomarkers and they found this this is
just amazing the hedonic well-being group actually scored lower than people that had
low well-being to begin with while the eudaimonic groups scored off the chart and in the health
of their immune system and yet they appeared the same on psychological tests of well-being
what that means is that the decreased immunity is going to lead to decreased psychological
scores over time right right and so some of the team at Neurohacker wrote a really brilliant
paper on this I think it's going to publish soon but if one is pursuing states of experience
that through processes that create momentary spikes but end up eroding baseline then of
course you can have elevated state on the short-term and eroded baseline long-term if you
are pursuing states of experience where you actually want to evolve the baseline itself
then it's a totally different approach and this is the two marshmallow experiment right we all
we all know this but it is very meaningful to say it is actually anti-addictive what it ends up
creating the highest quality of life which you could say would be smart hedonism if someone
wants to really have highest quality of experience that gets higher over time then it's not about
short-term spikes it's about the evolution of baseline and the evolution of baseline means
what actually builds the integrity of the system enduringly I'm kind of confused on that one can
you explain that one just a little bit more to me somebody goes somebody goes for the chocolate
cake they feel good in the moment they feel shitty over time as they eat a lot of chocolate cake
because they got a dopamine spike but they got a dopamine spike in a way that affected the rest
of their physiology sets that it's going to lead to an imbalance in their dopamine opioid access
and a bunch of other systems so then of course as they feel shittier then they crave more dopamine
spikes because their baseline is lower right their baseline well-being is lower which then
wants to feel better more quickly and as it wants to feel better quickly then it's going to go for
whether it was the chocolate cake the cocaine or the whatever it is that creates a hit and so we
can think of addiction as an eroding base you know speak some process to increase subjective
well-being quickly that actually decreases the integrity of the system that lowers the baseline
that creates more desperation to then feel better which leads to doing the same process you know
I got you yeah so you were referring to the the short-term aspects of it then and how that responds
yeah I agree and someone is even pursuing hedonism intelligently which says I actually want to feel
good but I want to feel continuously good and progressively more so over a long period of time
a fundamentally different approach has to be taken I still think that's going to come down to
though you know like they they found I mean in psychological well-being scores the people who
pursued hedonism on a regular basis they scored very well on that psychological well-being just
as well as the ones that were you know living life with a purpose per se but you know I just
I think that there is there is some aspects that we're all going to experience that hedonistic
approach but I think if we have that overriding purpose that vision of where where we want things
to be and we're living towards I mean just you know one of the examples that Dr. Cole used was
you know the person who climbs Mount Everest I mean sure you can look at that as potentially a
hedonistic aspect but if they're doing it to show humanity that that it can be done then that's a
whole different psychological aspect to their well-being that they're utilizing there I think
that the part of me that I'm speaking to that is worth reconciling is there is an old Puritan
distinction where pleasure is a bad thing and particular interpretation and so really we're
seeking pleasure in the afterlife or something right sacrifice is a good thing and purpose
and meaning end up not being associated with pleasure and that distinction is an obsolete one
right well we can say that the highest kinds of the pleasure that are very real because like you
said you have some psychological scores from people who are pursuing who are focused on their
own state versus focused on some larger things that include their own state and the key is focused
on larger purposes but that will end up including their state rather than excluding it and
so as people pursue being of use to larger than themselves that will end up inexorably
leading to them feeling better and as to the degree that people actually feel better they
will have more resources to show up more so we would just like I would like to have people think
about advancing their own subjective quality of life and advancing their utility to the whole
as being inner symbiotic with each other I completely agree with that I think that that
kind of brings it all together there and it makes a lot of sense to me you know my goal is to
get to the point where we can reverse age and it's not a and obviously it does have a
hedonistic component to it but in in a sense it's more about an over overriding purpose
for me to be helping to create this new paradigm and to advance humanity in that regard because
I see it as possible and people will look at it and say you know it's hedonistic to want to
live forever well no not necessarily I can see that in that in what you just used as the example
there maybe we'll have an opportunity a show to discuss approaches to the future of anti-aging
sometime that would be cool it's that is my my passion for sure so going down that road a little
bit and and I know we're running a little short on time but I want to ask you what your vision is
to take a look at 10 years down the road where do you see medicine and you know just life in
general I mean we're at this exponential growth phase of technology and and science and 10 years
is a is a millennium what can we achieve in that amount of time if we think not just about
individual technologies but we think about technological ecosystems that create synergistic
capacities across the ecosystem I think it's that's a very meaningful thing to think about for the
next 10 years because we could just talk about robots that do surgery better and individual
diagnostic technologies and individual therapeutic technologies but it's really the that entire system's
capability that's interesting right I think we will see some radical progress in diagnostic
and assessment technologies that'll be things like the evolution of mass spec for metabolomics and
maybe home metabolomics so the quantified self devices move from relatively small number of
metrics to a lot of metrics and a lot of fidelity of information that leads to big data at the level
of individuals I think that'll be a huge thing I think we'll probably even do some further out
stuff like laser interferometry for testing more blood metrics without even pricking the blood we're
already doing like you know nanobiosin technologies for being able to do advanced PCR like technology
from a single drop of blood so I think ubiquitous data bio data about people and then cognitive
and psychological data will lead to our ability to do of course assessment across lots of people
but also even big data on a single individual because of frequency of testing and all the
things that we get a test that will lead to you know early disease indicators also what we would
call you know need for support system resilience indicators but that tremendous amount of data
will have to be processed on different kinds of processing platforms so I think combinatorial
AI interpretive platforms are going to be a really key thing to be able to say all right so we have
inflammatory metrics we have nutrient metrics we have you know proteomic transcriptomic
metabolomic etc all this data how do we look at each of those biometrics not just in relationship
to a reference range but in relationship to all the other metrics and see how those metrics are
inner affecting each other and how the causal cascades happen which things move first in response
to behaviors or environmental stimuli that then lead to other things moving that lead to recursive
effects and so and this is a this is a very unique kind of AI and it will actually require
the evolution of the understanding of the of the ontology of human physiology how the
regulatory systems interact so we take kind of a complex adaptive systems and cybernetic view
of the human as a as a complex regulatory system an adaptive system and it allows us to then not
just be doing machine learning on big data but actually knowing what to look for for complex
causal dynamics so that it actually drops that nearly infinite amount of information back into
computable sets and then I think therapeutic technologies will be getting better on the
medicine side in terms of I mean already seeing immuno oncology it's like one of it's one of
the first things coming out of what we call traditional medicine pharmaceutical medicine
that is for something that isn't acute that is actually great right so really happy to see that
I think there will be a lot in terms of therapeutic technologies for infection many different kinds
mucosal infection humoral cellular infection for toxicity and subclinical kind of detox
that's another key thing is the really understanding subclinical pathology and how to
assess it and address it and then of course how to prevent it understanding more about
genetic expression and how to modulate genetic expression so there will be therapeutic dynamics
at each of those levels and the key of what we'll be coming to is moving towards personalized
medicine not just at a personalized towards a few snips in someone's genome or even common
torques of the genome but personalized to all of that data that we have so we stop thinking about
ms as a disease or rheumatoid arthritis as a disease we start and we stop even thinking about
cognitive enhancement as a thing that is optimized a certain way give them a rasset hammer
we start thinking about all of the different pathways that are involved and the causal cascades
the multifactorial causal cascade so we see someone's ms there might be thousands of different
pathways that can contribute to the deviation from homeostasis that leads to ms and anyone's ms might
be some weighted subset and when I say ms I could mean anxiety at Alzheimer's anything right some
weighted subset of those factors that led to that pathophysiology so then we can know how to do
differential diagnosis across the whole underlying causal set possible causal set right the causal
phase space see what specific things are actually going on and then not be treating a disease cluster
but treating the specific pathways that are going on and again where sometimes we are specifically
reversing some aspect of pathology but we're primarily focused on increasing system resilience
and homeostatic capacity for the body to be able to do that across all kinds of dynamics
and that you know that looks like increasing efficiency of cellular function increasing
efficiency of mucosal membranes you know etc. I agree with you and I would even take it a step
further I mean I in 10 years I mean with what we've got going on right now with CRISPR technology
and you know I'm interviewing a lot of the people in the field right now CRISPR the nanobots all of
this stuff I think within 10 years I mean it absolutely is going to be a bioinformatics
field no doubt about that but I really do see that we are going to be stepping away from
disease models it's just not going to exist I mean we're going to we're going to take care
of cancers we're going to take care of heart disease before it even comes about and if it
does come about it'll be something that they can go in do some editing on the on the immune system
and create a response that is ideal and we have a tool right now with CRISPR that it's like given
this it's like being given a teleporter and not have and not knowing how it's used or or anything
like that I mean we've got a technology that is ahead of our knowledge and I think once we start
to learn how to use this I mean this technology I mean you can order CRISPR for your home basement
to do it do lab work in your basement I mean that's how simple this technology is but it's going to
be amazing what comes out of this and nanotechnology on top of that I mean I just I really see a whole
new realm of health and I think physicians there's going to be a little need for physicians most of
the time I mean you're going to be looking at computer AI bioinformatics systems you're going
to be looking at that can compute much greater amounts of details than the human brain can process
as a clinician so you're going to have them running the show for these things and and I think it's
going to be an exciting time yeah so when we think about exponential technology and medicine so
thing technology that enables more technology of its kind on exponential curves so we think of
nanotechnology synthetic biology CRISPR genome editing AI etc one of the interesting things is
of course you're getting so much more rate of change right so much more change per unit time
and continuously so that we can't have the same adaptive time periods we've had in the past and
our intuitions from the past are less and less adequate at the same at the same time our chance
of fucking things up increases exponentially too because any increased power and we've seen this with
all of the major environmental problems that we see in the world or the application of humans
using technology and even you know so many of them in the biotech right that we're dealing with
the health issues technology has increased power especially if it's not already a self-organizing
system has the ability to have positive and destructive applications and mostly destructive
not intentionally but because we just didn't understand the full causal dynamics that were
happening and so with CRISPR for instance the reductionist approach of this single nucleotide
polymorphism does this thing so we're going to remove it you know from the genome let's say we
take apo e4 but then we're starting to get indication of the role of apo e4 and parasitic
immune function and it doesn't automatically lead to Alzheimer's it leads to increased predisposition
if environmentally triggered in some way so I it's not that I'm not you know fascinated by
CRISPR we we spend a lot of time with it but I think that it is critical that we come to understand
complex systems dynamics much much better than we're even currently close to before we think we
understand them well enough to edit the self-organizing code itself and so in as we are working
towards that affecting genetic expression through epigenetic switches and through
neutral genomics is awesome and genome editing requires us increasing our level of understanding
tremendously well and I think even when we get to the point of the genome editing you're still
going to be having to deal with this whole biospherical system of the body interacting I mean
you know it's the expression of 23 000 genes to make over a million proteins there's a lot going
on between the code itself and the outcome and and I think that you know the epigenetics is not
going to be going away we may get better at it but it's still going to be a major network of
complex interactions that just basically will come down to you know living the lifestyle that
that promotes the most optimal function of the human being yeah one more thing I'll say about
the future of medicine and well-being that we haven't mentioned but that I think is really
critical and I'm sure you talk with your audience about it often is if we see before someone is
would normally be diagnosed with lupus or some kind of rheumatism or whatever we see certain
autoimmune antibodies expressing we see certain cytokines expressing well we can say okay so
this inflammatory marker causes this illness or we see certain hormones out of balance before
another illness obviously what that means is that that inflammatory marker that hormone was part of
a causal cascade but it was not the beginning of the causal cascade right those are messenger
molecules there's something upstream from that we can go all the way upstream and say what would the
tier one deviation from the homeostatic integrity of the system be that leads to that process and
you say all right well health is defined as the homeostatic capacity not being in homeostasis
but the total homeostatic capacity of the system and more robust health means more homeostatic
resiliency ability to handle larger stressors larger deviations from homeostasis without actually
leaving homeostatic ranges cool so that's health then we say aging is different than disease
disease is some deviation from homeostasis that exceeded the system's capacity to stay within
functional ranges leading to pathophysiology aging is decreased homeostatic resilience
of the system so the system might still be in homeostasis across any particular metric but it
has less resilience so increased susceptibility to disease so that distinction ends up being
meaningful but you come all the way up and you say well it initially starts with some
deviation from homeostasis that exceeded the system's capacity illness specific I mean the
system's capacity to respond to so that initial deviation is always going to be either the way
the system is interacting with the human here but we could say this for any biological system
way the system is interacting with its environment that is not aligned with what its evolutionary
code can process or the overarching behavior of the system that's not aligned with its evolutionary
code or an actual problem the evolutionary code problem the evolutionary code means
genetic predisposition for illness independent of environmental expression but let's just throw
that category off to the side for a minute take the other two so interface with the environment
means taking in too much of something it shouldn't have which we call toxicity of various kinds
pathogenicity etc not taking in enough of something deficiency overarching behavior of the system
means exercise posture sleep you know lifestyles stress lifestyle things where the system is
behaving in ways that again are not what its evolutionary code adapted to be able to do well
which leads to some kind of system stress dynamics so we come up to those those tier one causes and
we say all right well we want to be able to optimize human wellness we actually want to make
sure we're addressing things at that level right the homeostatic resilience the whole system and
also decreasing the tier one dynamics since so many of those are the interface with the environment
where we have ubiquitous toxicity exposures whether we're talking about chlorine in the water
to deficiency from not enough minerals in the water to not enough minerals or human
conflux acids or microbiome in the soil where the food is coming from to vo season the paint inside
we have modified our environment post industrial revolution in a way that is
not what our genetic code adapted to process that is a tier one cause of so much illness so
in an environment that has a lot more nitric oxide in the air and more particulate emissions and
the higher co2 and you know etc and ubiquitous glyphosate and can people be optimally healthy
in that environment well no they can do things to support themselves to be healthier than they
would be otherwise but this is where our health and the health of the environment that we're in
osmotic gradient relationship with is interlinked and this is where optimizing human health and
optimizing the health of the entire entire biosphere and the and the way we design our
built world the toxicology of it etc are all key so this is where I'd say I can't we can't actually
talk about the future of medicine or the future of wellness well being independent of the topic of
the comprehensive redesign of the way we do being human on this planet and all of the aspects that
are interfacing I agree that is very well said the the one area that we may differ in and I'm
not sure what your thought process is on this but I kind of lean towards the the programmed aspect
of aging in our genome it's a we're a small group of of philosophical belief systems that
that our DNA is actually in a sense programmed to to start to down regulate a lot of the systems
that we have and I think that that's that's going to be a major area of the genome editing once we
start to identify these these programs that we carry that tell the system you know what don't
function as well at this don't don't do as well in monitoring as you have I mean we've got examples
in nature of animals that show no signs of senescence whatsoever so I think it's a combination of the
two I think there is there's absolutely this environmental and biospherical aspect of the
things that we interact with that are going to contribute to to this process but I think that
there's also a very strong component of genetically programmed deterioration of the of the human being
this is probably true if we could have dynamics that were more like lobster or jellyfish in this
way that is obviously very meaningful and I think you know senes and rad and those organizations
are definitely doing deep dives and what what that could be I think even before we identify that
there's a lot we can do to deal with the likely effects of it which is can we induce increased
autophagy of senescent cells can we protect cells from senescence can we increase development of
more stem cells and their differentiation throughout tissues yes you know so we can do those
then of course if we can deal with the underlying mechanisms that lead to more senescence than
is necessary in the first place obviously that's powerful well I don't want to keep you all night
and I could certainly do that this has been a fascinating conversation and and really
thought-provoking as well and I'd love to have you back on the show to discuss some some other
aspects that I would love to get into I had a whole list of additional questions that I didn't
even come close to so well I love being on the show I love your approach to health and wellness
and you know vitality and eutomony optimization and what you're sharing with people and you know
why we call it narrow hacker collective is because the goals that we seek to you know help bring
about here obviously can only happen in a meaningful meaningful partnerships and symbiosis with
everyone that's working towards similar goals so I look forward to exploring how we can continue to
be aligned and mutually supportive as much as possible and these shared goals
awesome well I certainly appreciate your time and look forward to further conversations
likewise thank you my friend well as you can tell I could have probably gone all day in my
conversations with Daniel Schmockdenberger he is a fascinating individual and we've had some
conversations unrecorded over the past couple of weeks and we have a couple more planned but
he just really helps me to take my brain to areas that I don't expect not only from his
qualia product but also from his conversations themselves he is an individual that is going
to change the world and he fits very well into our vision of the appear on center for human
potential as far as shifting the whole paradigm of a process in our situation it's of the health
and wellness process in his I can't even put it into a box he's talking about economies he's
talking about health and wellness he's talking about commerce I mean everything he talks about
philosophically is about this systems approach so very fascinating be sure to check out the links
