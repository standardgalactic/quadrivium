gosh am I upset so I definitely just recorded this video two different
times with different OBS settings and they both were just terrible I if
anyone knows of a good video to get OBS audio setup between your mic so
basically what happened was I had my mic set up but for some reason all of the
default mics were set to the mic I had plugged in so when I listened back to the
audio you could not only hear me four times but it was extremely loud I think
I fixed it now I certainly hope so I'm gonna try to get through this video
quickly so I'm not super frustrated if I fail again but anyway other side note
I've switched to using herbs left herb slough I don't know how to say it but
it's a pretty cool window manager I like it quite a bit I might do a video on it
soon but anyway this isn't about that this is about my favorite my very
favorite library and all of maybe all of Unix because I use it hundreds of times
a day some maybe even thousands I don't count but it's called the read line
library and it's used in bash as what's called the line editor so command line
interfaces will often have line editors ZSH has one called ZLE which just
stands for ZSH line editor but read line I've done videos on before it's the one
that's on by default in bash but I found some amazing new tricks I have to show
you so just as a brief reminder the read line library is how you control the
line the CLI like I said before so you can do things like if I type three word
four words and one of the lead one I can hit control w and I can control w again
to delete a second one if I want to repaste those in a different spot I can
hit control y I pasted them in the same spot in this case but if I want to let's
say paste them at the beginning so let's use a different example one word two
word three word four control w control w control a to go to the beginning of the
line and then control y to paste them and then I can hit a space there dad that
space there so you can also just from where you are delete backwards and then
it control e to go to the end of a line control y to paste again so we're back
to where we were before now all that's great I've shown that before so this is
just a refresher for those of you who might be new or I'm sorry for those of
you who saw it before I guess it will be new to those of you who are new but I
found some amazing new features that I just could not hide because they were so
great so awesome so one of those is I've always done control backwards and
control forwards to move forward by word so it makes more sense if there's a
bunch more words there right that's how you move forward that's actually in
read line by default you can hit control I'm sorry alt B to go backward by word
or alt F to go forward by word now in Herbst left control alt F is it's key
bound to full screen so I can't do it here I can overwrite that in fact I
can't think of a time when I would need full screen in Herbst left so I might
just overwrite that by default that seems like that would be for the best but
anyway so that navigation is really valuable and it was new to me I don't
remember if I've shown this before but if you do something like I hope I showed
it before something like this and you want to change or you want to delete
just a certain path in the directory if you hit control W you go back to the
most recent space I'm hitting control Y to bring that back but if you do shift
all backspace you go to the most recent non-alpha numeric character like that
right so I could easily just delete this and then backspace here type var and
then control Y to bring back what I deleted using shift all backspace and
I'll put all these key bindings in the description so it makes sense
remember though if they don't work it could be that your window manager or
something else is bound to those keys so just keep that in mind as well
additionally if I want to do let's say I want to copy this file to this one
I want to do that now these files don't exist but let's say they did exist but I
got them in the wrong order like the first one didn't exist but the second one
did right I could easily just let's count here we have if we start at zero we
have zero one two arguments and I can use the bang directive which is the
exclamation point to slice the previous command so you'll know if you've ever
done anything with with bash redline before that the exclamation point just
means previous command and so if you do previous command and then you type the
history number it will repeat that I don't know what two three four is I'm not
gonna run it it will repeat that command in your history if you do previous
command previous it does the exact most recent command so it'll try to see the
copy command here but if I want to do something special with that like slice
the previous command I can do let me just type it again here actually so
remember again we have zero one two arguments I can do CP bang directive and
then zero one two sorry one two two one and you can see here that's replaced
those two in in order using what are basically slices or arrays or whatever
your lists whatever your favorite programming language calls them I don't
know what bash calls them so these are amazing new things I've learned but
there is one way more amazing thing I've learned it's so amazing I can't believe
it's real I'm gonna start using it I'm fairly positive but I haven't used it
enough yet so the one thing I never made the connection to is that these
commands I've described control a to go the beginning of the line control k to
delete from the cursor those are emacs keybindings and I never made that
connection before the read line library was written by the same people who wrote
emacs Richard Stallman was on that team etc but because so many people working on
the library preferred by as a text editor they made a mode called by mode
which you can enter by doing set tack oh by again this only works on bash this is
not implemented in ZLE so what does that do well you always start an insert mode
so I'm just typing but if I hit escape you can watch my cursor there escape it
goes back on to the keys and I'm now in normal mode editor mode visual mode I
don't remember the name of the mode and by but I'm using H&L to navigate the
keyboard right I can hit J&K to cycle through history right so these are
commands I just typed right I can hit zero to go to the beginning of the line
dollar sign to go to the end be to go backwards words everything you can do
in in by the default by key bindings you can do here so if I want to do delete the
whole line I can do DD if I want to paste it back I can do P right and I can
of course like I said cycle through history the way I just showed or I can
yank let me see if I if I just yank a word here let's do YW go to the end of
the line hit capital P pasted what they're wrong whoops kind of you don't do
oh yeah I can do you don't do totally fine you see though I can I can hit I to
go back into edit mode so now I've hit I to add a space there escape to go back
all of those key bindings you're used to let me if I do can if I do V do I grab
the actual oh okay if you hit V it actually opens up the command in Vim
which is cool and I'll bet if I edit it it'll take me back let's see if I do that
let me get out of here now oh no that didn't work at all oh is that an actual
command I didn't know that anyway so maybe maybe the editing there is actually
a little bit more it's a little bit tougher than I thought I might have to
get used to it I just started using this I just found out it's real so let's
clear here because and this if you want to go back to normal if you just want
to experiment with it you just do set taco emacs which of course brings us
back to where we were before I can hit control you control Y control B or all
be etc control K all the same stuff we had before you can also change the key
bindings on either of these I didn't realize that as well I mean it makes
sense that you would be able to customize it it's all open source it's all
here on the actual computer you're running it from so that makes sense but
if you want to do what I do in Vim or Vi which is I don't like hitting escape to
exit insert mode I'm gonna enter insert mode now and I'm gonna type something
what I do to get out of insert mode is I just hit double J I've made that key
binding accessible to me so I can escape insert mode that way without having to
reach for my escape key you can key bind read line to do that as well whenever
you're in Vi mode so anyway that's all I really wanted to show play around with
it let me know how you like it I think it's awesome I'm probably gonna start
using it I just got to you know change some key bindings up I have never liked
ZSH is ZLE the their line editor which is why I've never switched to ZSH
whenever I start Cali up now I always switch the default shell back to bash
because I'm so familiar with the key bindings oh did I not show the kill
buffer oh my god I'm sorry I'm so sorry that was one of the coolest things ever
and I didn't even show it so in read line here's another I guess another trick
you're getting for free this is a bonus part of the episode whenever you're in
emacs mode which I was my the default one I'm used to I showed you that kill
buffer so if I want to do word 1 word 2 if I hit control w and then I hit control
y that pastes what I just deleted right what I just found out is that this is
actually being pasted from what's called the kill buffer which you can cycle
through so I just deleted word 2 now I'm gonna delete the whole line this means
when I hit control y let's say I want to do echo and I don't hit control y right
it pays back what's the most recent item in the kill buffer but I can cycle
through the kill buffer by not moving my cursor and hitting alt y so you see we're
now at word 2 which I just deleted the first time so if I delete all this now
and I hit control y we can cycle through the kill buffer again to see the most
previous things we've deleted anyway that's an incredibly powerful command if
you want to store very complicated commands in your if you're doing in
bash let's say these aren't complicated commands but let's just say we're doing
something like copy thing doesn't matter what it is and then I'm over here doing
I want to pipe that to a different command blah blah but I don't know if
this second command works I can do control you to delete the entire line
test the second command works and then I can paste back and then edit whatever I
want but if I need to edit the command that I'm testing okay that didn't work
but maybe it will work if I do it like this then all I have to do oh okay I
don't know what that's about but and then I want to get back to the command I
was testing I can hit control y and then cycle through that kill buffer to get
back to where I was and start re-entering the command I was testing anyway a
little bit all over the place this video I've been gone a while because of work
stuff I won't go into it here maybe I'll do a just audio update but anyway very
cool stuff the redline library is significantly more powerful than I
originally thought it was I'm gonna start using vi mode and let you guys all
know how it is you guys have any advice for OBS let me know I am terrible at it
they're like a good once-over video I'm you know it's not the reason I don't
upload I don't upload because I'm lazy but I have never had such a bad time as
I did today anyway hope all you guys are doing well I'll be back on shortly
