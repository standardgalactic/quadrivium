Hello, my name is Daniel Schmockdenberger, I'm the founder of a research project called
Strategic Global Solutions that was started in early 2007, primarily aimed at answering
the question, if we care about dolphins and whales and the health of the oceans and the
welfare of people in Africa and children all around the world and education and health
care reform and all of it, excluding nothing and recognize the problems in all these areas
as inextricably interconnected.
And our deepest desire is to support the evolution of a global system that supports and makes
possible the highest quality of life for all life now and evolvingly.
How do we get from here to there as effectively and efficiently and quickly as possible as
one integrated project factoring everything?
And that really appealed to us as a meta-imperative for our species and that for all evolutionarily
minded, omni-inclusive value humans, this is really our goal.
How do we organize our activity as a species towards the evolution of the most effective
viable fulfilling world system for all?
And in order to answer that question, how do we get from here to there as effectively
as possible, we recognize that understanding the data points of here and they are very
well with a first critical starting place.
And so when we look at what the data point of here is, we started to inventory what are
all of the areas of need, what are all the areas of global problems, and this is all
the problems in education and in agriculture and in species extinction and in fundamental
flaws of economics and governance structures and all of that.
To really be able to deeply inventory, what are all the areas that need resource allocated
to them?
And we find that we have three primary areas.
We look at what are the areas of human and environmental need that are already being
met to some level and we want to make sure that they continue to be met at that level
or higher as we work with other things.
What are existent problems that need remediated and then the development of new technologies
and systems that can meet needs at a higher level?
And we found that there is no centralized inventory of what we as a species really need to do
to make life on this planet viable for everybody that you and didn't have it and the organizations
did and there were a bunch of parts of it in different places.
And as much as many of us might have romanticized about if we had the power to really make
changes in the world, what we'd like to do, we realized that if we were in that position
that we were profoundly under informed to actually know what needs done, in what time
scales, how to allocate resource to all of that with the most effective ways to go are
and that this was clearly information that we needed to develop in great detail to be
able to have that power.
And so as we were inventorying in problems or what you could call more generally areas
that need resource allocated to them, we saw that we needed to develop the right kinds
of metrics to be able to compare all these issues.
And so we looked at metrics like what the scope of any particular issue was, how much
human life was affected by this issue directly and indirectly, where we specified what direct
and indirect means, how much non-human life is affected directly and indirectly, what
the magnitude of that effect is, which means how much quality of life is affected.
We need to look at urgency, which is what are the time scales in which these issues
have to be addressed that if certain benchmarks aren't reached in critical mass points of
irreversible harm occur so that we know the timelines in which we have to address these
things, how are all the different problems interconnected?
So this particular problem feeds into all these other ones so we can see that agriculture
and soil issues feed into water table issues, for instance, and that these issues are also
fed into by everything from economic issues to issues with pesticides and genetically
modified processes and all these things.
So for any issue, what are all the areas that feed into it, are all the areas that feed
out of it so that as we're looking at resource allocation, we can start to look at the complexity
of the interaction of how we address something, making sure that it doesn't externalize harm
to other areas inadvertently and that we maximize the externalization of positives to other
areas and that we can see how, as we work on any part of it, how that affects the systemic
overall evolution of the whole, which is really our goal.
And then we also look at the etiology of each of these issues, how those issues came into
being and what the political components are and the economic vested interest components
and the technological components and the social value system components and all the levels
of cause and effect that have to be addressed for an issue to really be fundamentally resolved.
And so when we address all the levels of cause and effect and we address all the interconnection,
then we really are looking at fundamentally viable solutions.
And one of the reasons we got into this was because of a background in many different
areas of activism and seeing how much problems were mostly just moved because they didn't
address all the levels of cause and effect and all the interconnections and how much
well-intentioned activism that doesn't have a deep enough understanding of the problems,
how they all interconnect and deep enough strategy involved to really be truly affected.
And we want to make sure that all good intentioned heartfelt action is backed by the most intelligent
strategy to really produce the best results, which is, you know, all of our goal.
And so all of these metrics for what we can call the problems end up serving as a basis
for being able to evaluate most effective strategies and best practices, which then
we also start to inventory, what are all of the solutions to be able to address each
of these problems, where all the solutions have been proposed so far, and how to be able
to look at the input to output ratios for all these solutions, how much resource it
takes to do a particular solution for how much measurable change comes out of it and
measurable change in that local area of concern and measurable change globally when we factor
how it inter-effects everything else.
And so our goal then is to be able to have the most effective strategies in their particular
area and the strategies that have the most effective overall impact and look at how strategies
in different sectors inter-effect each other symbiotically to have strategy guilds.
And so as we're inventorying the problems, inventorying the strategies, also then inventorying
what are the physical resources that we have to work with on this planet?
And this is looking at things like the reusability of waste streams, what we currently call waste
with our current and the developing technologies available, as well as things traditionally
called resource, because we need to know what we have to work with resource-wise, what we
have to work with strategy-wise, which is what converts resources into meeting needs
and what the needs are.
And all of this together informs also an awareness of what the sustainable carrying capacity
for our planet is, which right now is guessed at best, and the guess is very hugely from
a population much less than what we currently have to more than what we currently have.
This is a very important thing that we need to know as we move forward.
And obviously the carrying capacity is not a fixed number, but is arranged that's based
on how efficient the technologies are for moving resources into met needs, how high
a quality of life is being met, and several factors.
So this is all part of the project that we're working on.
So the next data point is getting clear on the there, which is where are we going?
Where do we want to be going?
And in activism and in governance so far, oftentimes we are moving away from problems
we're in reaction to, but without a very clear awareness of what a truly functional model
would look like.
And so we started asking questions like, if we were going to redesign human society and
human civilization from the ground up today, without assuming that any of the ways that
we have done things so far, necessarily the best ways to proceed, they might possibly be,
but really being able to inventory the starting with the best of everything we know of science
and technology and all like that today, what the best ways of meaning human needs in conjunction
with the environment harmoniously would be, how would we design civilization, what would
education look like, what would transportation look like, if we weren't trying to retrofit
maybe a fundamentally flawed system, but we're designing it starting with starting from scratch,
starting with the best of everything that we know now, and with the modularity and
evolvability to be able to evolve as quickly as possible with the input of new better strategies.
And so that we could really develop a blueprint and of course an ever-evolving blueprint that
gets to synthesize the best of information from all sources of where we are wanting to
move.
And so our approach has looked like this with regard to governance models, for instance.
And governance in the most general sense means how we collectively make decisions about what
it is that we need to do and how to best go about doing it.
And governance in general is different than government, which is a particular structure
of how we do it.
The biggest overall subjects that we're looking at here is a new structure of how we collectively
make decisions about what we need to do and how best to do it, which is a new system of
governance that is necessarily global because of, fundamentally, almost all of our issues,
pollution and war and trade and all like this, are global issues.
And a new system of economics that in its deepest sense means a basis for how we allocate
planetary resources towards which value system, are we allocating them to maximize differential
advantage of a few over many, or are we working to allocate them in a manner that scientifically
optimizes the possibility for quality of life for all life.
And so with regard to governance systems, we start by looking at all the governance systems
that have been attempted so far in a really philosophically uninvested and scientifically
critical way to look at what the effective and the unaffective parts of each of these
have been.
What are the really effective parts of capitalism that involve things like maximizing motive
to the individual?
And then what are the dysfunctional parts of it, which is some of the pathological kinds
of competition and externalization of harm and like that that occurs?
And what are the functional parts of communism and those systems that we're recognizing
that people are affected by the whole and we need to make sure that we're taking care
of the whole?
And then what were some of the dysfunctional parts like having individual human motive
not be maximized by those systems?
And how can we work to take the functional parts of all the systems that we've tried
so far based on a good analysis of the metrics that are involved, divested of the dysfunctional
parts and synthesized the functional parts of everything that humanity has learned so
far to a best of what we know on this topic, for instance, governance?
And then also to look at what we know about regulatory systems and control systems from
other systems like cybernetics and computer science and regulation of information flow
systems.
And when we look at nature and we look at how an ecosystem governs, which is more of
a kind of a bottom up emergent governance than a top down imposed governance, but where
there's so many moving parts that have an immaculate kind of balance, what's the operating
system?
What are the governance principles that are there?
And so we have kind of a biomimicry for social design.
And all of this is speaking to how to apply the scientific method and all the methodologies
of science, which is an opinion divested fact based decision making system to social design
and to societal design.
And this is what Carl Sagan and Buckminster Fuller and Jacques Fresco and many have talked
about as being fundamentally necessary for a long time.
There's not really a Republican versus a Democrat or a capitalist versus a communist
way of cleaning dirty water or bringing water to people that need it.
There's more and less effective ways of doing that in terms of input of resource to output
of what our desired output is.
And so how do we have a governance system that is as opinion divested as possible, as
fact based as possible, as omni-inclusive in the goal of what it is that we're working
on as possible?
And so this is really what we're looking at.
And obviously then the question is what really is the goal?
What do we call quality of life?
And this is a very deep topic that we also look at when we're talking about maximizing
the possibility for quality of life for all life.
What are the metrics that we're looking to optimize?
Because we know that GDP is not a good metric and that GDP per capita is not a good metric
if we're really looking at individual happiness and interpersonal happiness and sustainability
with the planet.
And so the goal is to be able to look at all of the different possible relevant metrics,
how they inter-affect each other and bring them into an integral picture that's able
to factor all of that and continuously factor new variables and metrics so it's an elastically
updatable system to give us the most comprehensive basis of what we're seeking to optimize.
So we want to look at when we're looking at maximizing quality of life, we want to look
at subjective metrics, people's reporting of their own happiness and all the different
dimensions of life, which is their happiness and their sense of creativity and contribution
and personal relationships and all like that.
We also want to look at objective metrics, which is we can look at things like suicide
rate and mental illness rate and crime rate and all the different things that look at
both how functional the system is from the point of view of individuals, from the point
of view of how individuals interact, from the point of view of how whole societies and
communities interact with each other and how they interact with the ecosystem and sustainability.
And then we also look at factors involving time.
Do we want people that are happy now and not really motivated to evolve or people that
are involving, motivated by discontent and obviously we care about both happiness now
and evolution into ever higher possibilities of happiness and the expression of human potential.
So how do we maximize both of these simultaneously and how do we answer all of this in a collective
way that pulls the best of everything that we know that's empirically founded, that's
opinion divested and where we don't know for sure how do we set up social experiments
to really be able to determine these things as best as possible and feed back and forth
the ground up social experiments to a centralized database of knowledge regarding these topics.
So critical path analysis is looking at how we get from here to there, for any particular
here and there, factoring many variables in a complex system and we look at which things
can happen simultaneously independent of each other, which things have to happen subsequently
because they depend upon the results of previous set of action and how do we allocate the total
amount of resources we have to each area in light of how that maximizes the systemic movement
and what are the best practices and best strategies for the utilization of that resource in each
area and all this comes together to do critical path.
Now when we're looking at the critical path for humanity's success, it's a dynamic critical
path because the here point is continuously changing as our global problems and global
needs change and this can happen in uncredicted ways all the time and a new earthquake occurs
and now we need to be able to look at oh resource needs allocated to dealing with that and that
means resources being taken from somewhere else and yet we still have all of our comprehensive
goals, how do we really optimize that process? So we have a continuously changing here point
and a continuously changing there point as new technologies emerge and new social understandings
emerge to where what the best of what's possible for societal design is keeps changing and so how
do we elastically upgrade and update our critical path with the input of all new relevant information
to where we know what we need to be doing now that is most effective towards the most long range
goals and all of our timely goals and that what we're doing now is continuously optimized in
light of the input of all new real information and so this requires a lot of complexity factoring
and so this is another thing we've looked at which is how do we see how a particular problem
relates to problems in other areas and potentially unanticipated ways when we only take a specialist
approach and how does a particular solution there end up affecting other areas because we can see
sometimes in solving a particular problem in a particular way we can actually externalize harm
to another area unanticipatedly like for instance when we were working to get off of foreign oil
by creating biofuels but in the process creating biofuels from agricultural sources that created
environmental damage we want we want to be able to make sure that as we're solving a particular
problem we're not externalizing that harm somewhere else so this requires a cross-sectoral analysis
and to have a functional cross-sectoral analysis we make sure that we're looking at all the other
sectors appropriately we need to know what all the sectors are this requires a taxonomy of
all of the issues that we're looking at and how they all interrelate to each other
and then how our goal is to be able to have solutions that are both optimized for their
particular area of focus and optimized for the systemic benefit when we factor all of the externalized
positives and negatives and this overall factoring all of our current problems and areas of need
and the timelines and the interconnections and the scope and the magnitude on all of that factoring
all the resources we have to work with factoring all the potential strategies and the way of
synthesizing those strategies and how those strategies interact each other and looking at
where we're wanting to go and what about that we know and it's clear what about that is not yet
clear that needs um refinement and experimentation uh to really be able to know where we want to go
in light of the most comprehensive kinds of metrics of what quality of life really means
and being able to optimize how we get from here to there continuously and recognizing there's no
fixed their point it's a continuously evolving uh progressive there this whole process of how
we collectively make decisions and how we and how we collectively allocate resource in a scientifically
optimized way creates the basis for a planetary operating system and a new system of global
governance and economics which is how do we as a conscious species recognizing that we're profoundly
interconnected that all of our needs and that all of our problems that all of our welfare is
profoundly interconnected not just with other humans in our area but with all other humans and
with all other species and not just now but ongoingly recognizing that how do we organize
all of our efforts and intentions and endeavors in specific areas in light of a whole meta endeavor
in an optimized way and this really is what appeals to us as not a another project amongst the
many projects but an organizational system that can potentiate and maximize the efficiency of
and the interconnected strategy between all projects all positive endeavors that need to be
happening and that's ultimately what our goal is here is a meta system for global governance and
organization of all evolutionary human activity in the broadest sense the direction of evolution
is ordering complexity higher orders of complexity which is two things it's more parts that are
involved more complexity and ordering that if we get a more complex system without adequate order
we end up just getting more entropy and it degrades to the last level and so if we look at
a cell a cell has all of the complexity of the component molecules that make it up but they're
arranged in a particular way that if we just had all of the molecules that make up a cell thrown in
a petri dish it wouldn't be a cell it would just be a heap of molecules it wouldn't be that interesting
when you arrange it when you order it that togetherness is what allows the cell to respirate
and to replicate even though none of the parts on their own do that and those emergent properties
come from ordering the parts into a whole and you know we can look at the same way in terms of a
nervous system and no neuron by itself thinks or feels it has a particular firing pattern but when
you order the firing pattern of all those neurons together in the way that a human brain and nervous
system works you get sentience and you get inus and consciousness well in the same way we have
as all of the many neurons are connected in our brain to create human consciousness and all of the
cells are connected in a particular pattern to create a human organism we have all of these cells
of human beings on this planet that when they're not ordered is basically just like a whole bunch
of cells separately which is not that interesting but when their activities are ordered together in
light of a higher order then humanity as an as an organism of sorts actually gets to emerge and
there are emergent properties that get to arise from that and what we're looking at creating here
with this global operating system is kind of a network for being able to take the database
inside of each human and be able to to take what everybody knows to be able to vet it and synthesize
it into a collected database that is ever evolving of the best of what humanity knows
about everything so far that is both able to be fed into by all people and fed out the relevant
parts to all people for maximizing our collective engagement organization and activity and so
rather than just being a bunch of separate neurons there's actually a nervous system
and a consciousness rather than just being a bunch of separate human individuals there's actually
humanity as not just a concept but really a functional entity
