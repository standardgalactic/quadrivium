One of the main things in life is purpose, and most people born in the history of man
have not had particular purpose other than staying alive.
We have an opportunity to not just stay alive, earn a living, feed yourself, but we have
an opportunity to change the outcome for future generations stretching out for more or less
ever.
Today I'm pleased to welcome Jeremy Grantham to the great simplification.
Jeremy almost 50 years ago founded the investment firm GMO, where the G stands for Grantham,
and by societal metrics he is now a billionaire, though in this conversation he corrects me
on the definition of that.
An amazing mind, and I long ago followed him because in his GMO research notes back
when I oversaw the oil drum, he was writing about phosphorus and about oil and about
climate change and integrating lots of the same topics in the biophysical economics
field where I reside.
It's very encouraging to me to have such a financially successful person, almost fully
dedicated to environmental causes, particularly climate change, endocrine disrupting chemicals,
plastics, population, and I hope this conversation can act as an overton window or a siren song
to more people of means to look at the big picture of how energy, humans, and the environment
fit together.
There is no greater story.
Please welcome Jeremy Grantham.
I have so many questions for you because you are what I might refer to as everything
bagel as far as understanding the human predicament.
Not only are you an expert in finance and stock market and conventional investing, but
you also deeply care about the environment, including but not limited to climate change.
Let me start by asking you this.
We live in a culture that the last generation or so has rewarded reductionist experts like
real estate developers or physicists, and we don't really reward generalists who know
something about everything and how things fit together other than maybe librarians and,
in your case, hedge fund managers.
How did you begin your lifelong career interest and how everything fits together in multiple
subjects and when and why did you start to integrate specifically energy, ecology, and
the environment into your worldview?
There are people like us that when confronted with any situation, eventually get around
to saying, what are the bigger issues that circle around the outside of what we're doing
and how do they interrelate?
And then gradually your familiarity expands outwards and if you're curious enough, you
keep on going and whether you like it or not, you're thereby becoming a generalist
because you want to know what causes, what causes, what causes and you work your way,
in my case, quite slowly from the stock market, what drives the stock market, what drives
people, what are the big issues, what are the weaknesses of human beings, what are the
problems, therefore, that come out of our weaknesses and pretty soon you arrive at nature
and then you get into the whole thing about what we owe to nature, what it contributes
to our well-being, to a true benefit GDP, if you will, as opposed to the actual GDP,
which is a list of costs when you get down to it, not benefits.
And so onwards and upwards, aspects of nature, limitations, Kenneth Balding, the finiteness
of the world, spaceship earth, hurtling through space with only what it has.
There are no space stations to go and reload with fuel or torpedoes or anything, you've
only got what you've got and if you think about what rules and regulations you would
need for a multi-generational space trip in a rocket, it gives you some ideas of what
rules you really should have on planet earth and you keep on going until you end up with
my self-described job at work, which is underrated long-term problems.
And that has been a fabulously rewarding era for about 15 years because they are the things
that are really interesting, obviously they are the things that really matter and they
are bottomless pits, so you'll never know too much, you keep trying and you still only
know a tiny fraction of the problem and pretty soon you're on a podcast with you.
Well, since we both have financial backgrounds, let me follow with this question.
We don't have prices or incentives to solve most of those underrated long-term problems.
So I've had a lot of financial people that understand energy on this podcast and I know
a lot of them in my circles, but it seems that the more financially focused people are,
the less they're focused on the environment, not so much in your case.
How do you integrate what's going on there?
Because a lot of financial people are almost to the point of cognitive dissonance dismissing
climate change and other environmental risks.
I am absolutely shocked over the last 30 years at how little interest my fellow financial
types have throughout the industry in these issues on which our long-term well-being absolutely
depends.
It is cognitive dissonance and it's surprising because some of them are unbelievably smart
and yet missing whatever it is.
I don't know if it's wisdom or if it's peripheral vision being wider, but they're just not interested.
It is enough for them to become expert in fiddling and diddling with finance and making
a lot of money.
I think I have mentioned to you before that I got into finance for a very profound reason
and that was I asked which of my classmates from business school were having the most
fun and back then in 1968 by a very wide margin the guys in the stock market were having the
most fun and so I thought, well, I don't want to miss out on that and then I was amazed
that I was earning $12,000 in consulting and up from 10 in a year and they hired me into
the financial business in Boston at 18 and that was the going rate, just 50% higher.
50% higher I might add than they needed to pay me, I would have gone for 10, forget 12,
forget 18 and so that was very much a secondary discovery.
They were not only having more fun but they were getting paid a hell of a lot more money,
what else not to like about that?
Well, we're going to get into some of the deeper issues on the environment and endocrine
disrupting chemicals, climate change and other things but let me ask you this, energy underpins
the natural world and it underpins human systems and I think people are starting to understand
that a little more but finance is a layer on top of that because money is a claim on energy
and debt is a claim on future energy. If we're really going to change the extractive growth
ecosystem, destructing human enterprise, don't the people at the helm of finance
need to be the ones to change? Doesn't that have to change somehow?
Yeah, we're not going to win what I call the race of our lives without huge government backing
and without the governments finding a way to encourage corporations to act more responsibly
and I think we may do that but we may not. It's a hard call.
Yeah, so we'll get back to that. I want to focus on climate, energy and the environment
in this conversation but you were on record recently in your main vocation regarding
stock market levels saying that we're in a super bubble. I think most people are aware of you and
your acumen in the financial sphere not in the environmental one. What is a super bubble and
why are we in one? A super bubble is typically about two and a half sigma.
All bubbles in my opinion, we had to define them arbitrarily so we took the historical data
and we said every two sigma event which is in a random world every 44 years and the stock
market world every 35 close enough for government work, we would call that a bubble and we went
through every asset class in the database, took us months and in the end we had a couple of hundred
two sigma bubbles. There was a handful of interesting paradigm shifts that didn't break
such as the whole Indian economy making a phase change from real peasant economy to a more complicated
industrial economy. Exactly the kind of exceptions you might think. Also oil appeared to go through
a paradigm shift back in the first opaque shock and never regrouped from that level
whereas the rest of commodities continued down for the 20th century. Oil you could say really
was flat slightly up and that was the great exception and a very important exception and
again very plausible. You might think that oil would show the first signs of beginning to run
out before other things and I believe it did. I saw a podcast with you a few months ago that
you say we're in a super bubble now in the stock market and that's more based on your conventional
analysis. Okay no everything is critical to what is a bubble, a two sigma and they in the
developed world they all went back to the previous trend prior to the bubble starting
and a classic bubble is two or three years up two or three years down and in the stock market
they've been very well behaved. A super bubble is kind of much more interesting because that has
penetrated through the two sigma territory of a badly overpriced market and continues up.
It also has a second criteria. It has to have really crazy speculation increase in all sorts
of financial activity. People have to start thinking that it will go on forever, that it's
a new paradigm, that they only worry about missing out. They buy stocks because they're going up not
because of anything to do with the fundamentals. The classic being the meme stocks probably one
of the greatest examples in modern times of 2020 and 2021 and there aren't many of these.
1929 was a Humdinger. 1972-74 the Nifty 50 was an honorary member right on the cusp that you
could put it either way. 2000 was another Humdinger, bigger and better than 1929,
full of absolutely crazy behavior. The housing bubble was very much a housing bubble,
crazy behavior, a three sigma event, a bigger remarkable breakout of housing prices even than
1929 and 2000 in stock prices and then once again in 2021 we had the two and a half sigma
and an utterly crazy behavior. I believe if you look at the scale of it the biggest
most significant crazy behavior in recorded history of the US stock market
and when you look at those they go back to trend like all the other normal ones
but they cause a whole lot more pain because they distort the system on the way up there is a huge
income effect and wealth effect and when they inevitably break they're always a shock because
everyone has locked into the new paradigm and they nearly always take longer than people think
because they're so powerful and they didn't get there by accident they were driven by some
underlying important fundamentals so there was lots to believe in but they eventually
come down to trend and all but one of them in history go below trend for a while
and that creates an enormous negative income effect and has always caused a recession.
If you miscalculate the recession turns into something really terrible like the depression
of 1929 like the the bitter recession of the nifty 50 72 74 of the near total financial
collapse of the housing bust in in 08 and one should expect something pretty bad this time
and we await to see if this follows the pattern of history or whether it is indeed
that lovely creature a new paradigm but history is not kind to the new paradigm thinking.
So let me ask you a couple of follow-ups to that your analysis of these super bubbles is based on
the concept of mean reversion that we revert to the trend but the trend of the last century
has been one of rising energy access globally we're now at a 19 terawatt global metabolism
and so the your analysis suggests that we're going to mean revert to the trend but on top of that
analysis there's also peak cheap oil geopolitical competition for a finite pie and growing ecosystem
disruptions so I don't I think they're the the entire trend line might start to flatten
or or decline what are your thoughts on that well regrettably you may very well be right
our last couple of papers began to spell out what we thought the fundamental problems were
that could go that could to get worse and I conclude that they are worse and more potentially
dangerous than the collection of fundamental surrounding all the other super bubbles including
1929 we we had we were really ham-fisted in 1929 we persevered in some terrible
international trade wars which was unnecessary and destructive and maybe we will be very clever
this time maybe we will be stupid once again who knows but there is a very dangerous set
which you were beginning to describe but with Russia and China the Ukraine and the resource impact
of of Ukraine Russia and so on and and with the breaking down of the the world in which
international trade increased to one in which international trade may very well slowly decrease
going from increasing efficiency to increasing inefficiency and with the population profile
shifting fairly violently by any any population standard we have never seen a shift of this magnitude
going from rapid growth to rapid decline in a 30-year window and you know in in in the
as recently as the early 1990s you couldn't find people talking about a population slowing down we
were roaring along and now the baby cohorts are in freefall they are dropping rapidly and and people
don't realize that the global cohort of babies is below 98 now 1998 though we peaked in about
0506 and we've been declining every year even though African baby cohorts are still going up
on a global basis the total is going down and in the developed world and China we are having in most
countries fewer 20 year olds entering the workforce and that is completely unique and and could have
very bad consequences and then we have the resource component I think I think my colleague and I
scooped we've only had one scoop and that was 2011 we wrote a paper time to wake up the age of plentiful
and cheap resources is gone forever in which we made the case that of course in a finite world
you would eventually expect that to happen and there were now finally signs that it was happening
but the but the final push over the edge had been the amazing and accelerating growth
in China in China's demand for important resources for for the last four years they
accelerated to double digit they were increasing at over 10 percent a year in their demand for cement
iron ore coal and I'm one or two other things but not not not oil
so you you have earned deep respect in the financial community for your long-term success
as an investor but I think I suspect many of your peers still look at money and technology as the
driver of of the human experience and may look at your views on commodities and energy and the
environment as somewhat Malthusian what are your thoughts there well my my thoughts are that Malthus
and what he said it's is a nice complicated topic that we could discuss for a minute or two
that for a year or two after our paper in 2011 as we hit the temporary cyclical setback
caused by China slowing and global grain weather improving everyone thought we were
entertainingly wrong and it took a few years before the long-term trend line to clearly be
different the long-term trend line for we keep a very interesting index at GMO 33 important
equal weighted commodities to study the the question what is happening to commodities not
what is happening to oil and iron ore and those 33 declined by 70% in the 20th century and yes
there were three spikes world war one world war two and OPEC of course but in between they dropped
back to the trend line which was declining at just over 1% a year which accumulates pretty
down fast over a hundred years so a drop in the average price of important commodities of 70%
enormous help in in getting rich and then in 2002 it shifted and the index that had gone from 100
to 30 is back over 90 it has tripled since 2022 this is not the trend that we all grew up on
this is this is a new world in which we are going to have to come to terms with the finiteness
of almost everything I think for reasonable purposes there's enough aluminum and iron ore
to get the job done and but everything else most of the metals we think of
on the same level with iron ore are 100 or more often a thousandth as frequent in the
earth's crust as aluminum and iron I think aluminum is about seven and a half eight percent of the
crust iron ore is four and a half and copper cobalt lithium nickel that we use for batteries and
so on they they range from 0.002 to 0.006 that's the range and you can take 30 of those important
chemicals like nickel and copper and add them all together and and they are 1% they aren't a tiny
fraction of iron ore or aluminum and nobody really gets there and there are no reserves anymore
China pretty well bled the last great minds of these important but actually rare metals
well in a convoluted way the 70 drop in that commodity basket in the 20th century
was due to an expansion of fossil armies of hydrocarbons that did the work for us and all those
extraction industries the rise of the machines so we had more access to oil and that oil and
the machines that had powered gave us more access to get the overburden from the mines
for copper and nickel and all the things you were mentioning but you said that that change in 2002
I think 1999 was the all-time inflation adjusted low for oil and we've been going up since and
the extraction costs for oil have tripled since around that time so we are in a new paradigm
there's just maybe a two decade lag before people start to notice it and puzzle it out
I agree so do people in your sphere when you go to hedge fund conferences or whatever those are
nowadays do they start to see the world through an energy lens or is that is that not yet happening
first of all I don't do that I spend more time mixing with people like you
and going to green gatherings and green tech gatherings and I haven't been to a hedge fund
gathering for 15 years but I can pretty well answer for them and most of them with a few
interesting exceptions do not get it at all and and it's a pretty good reason and that's because
the economic establishment has never gotten it you know the the classical economists had their
feet on the ground they understood they lived in a real world and Keynes did but the establishment
since then basically wasted in this efficient market rational expectation nonsense building
models to be neat and mathematical and and and show their physics envy but totally useless
they completely lost the plot as Kenneth Bowling who started out as a typical mainstream economist
and then kind of resigned when he was about 50 because he found economics totally useless as
in the direction it was heading and in my opinion it's totally right so everything you read from
the mainstream economics ignores the role of energy and resources you make a loaf of bread
with capital and labor with the oven and with the worker with the great paddle to stick it in the
oven you do not apparently need any wheat and you don't apparently need any heat it is absolutely
a laughable state of affairs but when you throw in these more difficult things your equations become
too complicated and start to break down and and when you leave them all out and you assume everything
away and you assume perfect knowledge and perfect information flow and in the stock market equal
knowledge on the side of the buyers and the sellers and all these ludicrous assumptions
as if it isn't a kind of wilderness of psychology the stock market you you get nonsense out of the
end of their of their equations and and and and big corporations and finance pick up on that
it it impregnates their their business so the financial equivalent of wasted 70 years
of economics is the efficient market hypothesis which which ran the university finance system
for 50 years again a total waste of worse than a waste it was damaging punishing and and sending
the world in the wrong direction Eugene Fama and Ken French were my honors advisors at the
University of Chicago and in the entire two years I was there the word energy was never mentioned
well you demonstrated commendable restraint by standing your ground that is a sneaky way of
saying is that saying if you'd known what you were doing you would have left and gone somewhere
more sensible I did that three years later after I started to figure it out one of my I was a high
net worth salesman at Solomon Brothers and one of my clients eventually started to trade oil futures
and I was learning about that and I was learning about how amazingly powerful this stuff is how
we don't pay for the cost of the of the externalities the pollution and how it's going to peak and
decline in my lifetime so soon after that I quit and went and studied with Herman Daly and others
so that that's how that happened that was over 20 years ago Jeremy yeah no it's surprising that you
could have something so valuable as as oil and metals and have them cost nothing except the cost
of digging it out of the ground and and and that is right there the fundamental flaw in economic
theory and in our governance and expectations of our current system is we're only paying for the
cost of extraction and the sad part is looking back all this magical pixie dust from that earth
trickle charged from prior photosynthesis has been wasted especially in the west we don't really
have anything to show for it you know anything of long-term value so piggybacking on something
you said earlier that we were ham-fisted in our response to the great depression in 1929 and you
hope that people could be more clever as opposed to not clever this time around so with an energy
lens and an ecological lens how could we be more clever this time around in theory that is pretty
simple you need a carbon tax now pigs will fly no that's not true eventually we'll all have carbon
tax because we'll get desperate and everybody knows even the idiot economists get get this right
that a carbon tax is far and away the most effective way of dealing with climate change
and you can bribe people into doing the right thing through subsidies but it's very inefficient
and expensive in contrast and it's just politically easier so a carbon tax would be the first
enormous step in the right direction for two reasons one is going to be politically unacceptable
at the moment which is half the people don't believe that climate and ocean absorption of our
emissions is critical and urgent and human-caused so it will be politically difficult for that
reason but the other reason to have a carbon tax is to make this incredibly I have to interrupt
half of americans it is nothing like a half around the rest of the developed world good point
yeah I read recently that if you know nothing at all and you just ask someone what their belief
is on climate change that the single biggest predictor of people's opinion on climate change
is their political affiliation which really is tells you something it's quite amazing
it tells you that we get information from different sources
among other things thank you for the clarification here's the other reason
that a carbon tax would be helpful longer term from the perspective of we're wasting this
incredibly valuable substance if there were a carbon tax the prices would be more commensurate
with its true cost and value and so we would conserve we would send the right signals to
innovators and investors like yourself that this this phone here might cost three thousand dollars
because it's got a lot of non-renewable inputs in it so there would be repair
and different industries would crop up around that but the challenge with such a carbon tax
is we are in financial overshoot not to mention ecological overshoot so any any
realistic carbon tax today would prick the financial bubble even even worse than the
mean reversion you expect yeah I think we shouldn't overlook the benefits of a carbon tax to
government income it's not only it would not only be a great source of income
but it would be taxing something you want people to use less of like tobacco and instead of taxing
labor that you want people to use more of and it would be a much better way of raising money
but you would have to make sure that you reduced income income tax on particularly the
fore end of the spectrum to compensate for the the tax on energy but but the rich people use
20 50 times more energy than the poor people around the world and and maybe even within the
country 10 or 20 times as we get more desperate sooner or later a a political regime will will
find it find its way to do something that is effectively a tax on on carbon there there is a
800 pound gorilla lurking around here that you're not aware of and that is I don't agree
with only one part one little slice of your of your argument as reflected
so well in your 95 96 podcast and that is the role of debt and finance in general the good news is
is if you take all the people in this game of overshoot living beyond our means is how I think
of it and and you look at how much they obsess about finance and have done forever for 30 40 years
and and you go back and you take it all out of everything they ever said or ever wrote it doesn't
make any difference at all it it has not changed anything that they in my opinion have gotten it
wrong and it probably will continue not to change anything so as long as they are generally
heading in the right direction everything will work out fine but I think debt is the most misunderstood
thing of all and the reason is pretty clear at the individual level when you're making a list
of what you're worth you add up your assets and you subtract your debt it is a negative
at the societal level debt is not like gold debt is not like copper or like stock market
a claim on real corporations with real workers and real output debt is a zero entry
debt is double entry bookkeeping we might as well say aren't the Japanese incredibly rich
that they can lend so much money but we don't say that we say look at the incredible Japanese debt
my god they will collapse as we have been saying for 40 50 years waiting for them to collapse
uh uh unsuccessfully I might add debt is shockingly misunderstood and exaggerated
insignificance you cannot move resources through time other than a few cans of bully beef in your
basement or at least make sure that the infrastructure is set up in good shape for your children
other than that you cannot move assets you cannot move income the Germans at least understood this
with their social security they know that it is a pay as you go they don't pretend as we used to
about lockboxes and social security going bust or accumulating you only have the sum of your goods
and services each year to pay your pensions and if that goes down you will have less either to pay
the pensions or less for everybody else it is not about debt claiming on the future debt does not
claim on the future what debt does is I give you my money today that I could spend and I lend it to
you that is not a claim on the future it does not transfer income through time but it scrambles
everybody's thinking and luckily in this field of overshoot it doesn't make a damn bit of difference
well you're a billionaire and I'm just a podcaster with a few rows of potatoes and a draft horse but
I am going to push back on on that a little bit um yes you're right that so far it has not made a
difference because so far we have lived in a world of rising energy access um every year with the
exception of a couple of of recessions yes you're right that in a financial lens it's a zero sum
game there are assets and liabilities so from that perspective it is a Pareto um problem where the
wealth gets more and more concentrated and the the creditors end up having a larger share of that
pie but from a biophysical perspective every time we create money uh via commercial banks or
recently via central banks there's the same amount of oil and forests and copper and dolphins
and so what ends up happening right now the United States has increased our debt one trillion
dollars in the last three months I mean it's like almost a billion dollars an hour yes that's allowing
us to consume more today and it's papering over uh other problems and it's one of the reasons stock
market and and bitcoin and other things are up but eventually when all this money has to be called
in to be spent that and especially if we're on the downslope of oil and instead of a hundred
million barrels a day we have 90 or 80 or 70 it's a musical chair sort of situation so I agree with
you that so far debt has not been a problem but I think what it's done is it's a it's an example
of risk homeostasis that we've run a red light 10 times and nothing bad ever happened that doesn't
mean that running a red light isn't dangerous I uh understand you have to protect your opinions
no no no I want to learn if you disagree please please educate me I was counting on you you're
saying that I happily I don't think it matters so I don't want us to spend any more time because I
have an eccentric view and plenty of people would think you're right they they they share your your
view just one point though I am only a billionaire by a strange and generous construction and that
is if you count the money I have given away which is which is a pretty whimsical way
of calculating someone's net worth but in terms of what I actually have and could go out and and and
buy my daughter back from being kidnapped tomorrow I don't have a a I'm at least an order of magnitude
short of of that well I actually think that is a wonderful way to define being a billionaire in
the future isn't it going forward that you count how much money you have given away towards pro
social pro future ends I mean that's a better definition wouldn't you say it would be yeah conducive
to better behavior maybe but it is important at least to get that out there and and most of what
we have left we we see as a potential reserve for a rainy day and and incidentally we have a rainy day
in our foundation our foundation is about 1.4 billion and we have invested perhaps an unwisely
large piece in venture capital a large chunk of which is green venture capital and the reason for
that is we think that green venture capital if you only invest in things that seem really important
and you concentrate on those that have a hard time
raising the money you'll end up with a risky portfolio but on paper should give you a
in a hundred deals a very high return and traditionally it has but every 15 or 20 years
it it participates in these excuse me in these bubbles and so we get hammered and we become
illiquid and the companies call for the money that we've committed and they stop funding it back
which we you know really count on and that causes a liquidity squeeze so times are tricky
I will say this though that I think a a diversified package of important green venture capital
drives the cause better than anything very hard for a dollar of grant
to keep up with a dollar of green venture capital because the green venture capital
on average comes back with 15 profit and then goes out again and out again and out again
uh so those dollars can be really in the long run very very effective so uh what are some projects
you're particularly excited about in the in the green venture capital area of your work well if
you started at the top end what could be a get out of jail card uh from our conundrum or a potential
get out of jail card you would have infinite cheap green energy right so that would be a huge
help and when solar and storage might make it but we'd probably need an order of magnitude
improvement in storage costs a drop to ten cents on the dollar and we'll probably get it
it might take 10 or 20 years and it might take who knows longer shorter
but the other ones are geothermal I am very optimistic that if we could take our incredible
ingenuity and the experience and the trial and error from having drilled 200 000 fracking wells
uh learning on the job if we could take some of that skill set and move it to geothermal
there is a virtually infinite supply of energy under our feet if we could learn
through ingenious ways of drilling to handle the temperature to frack it to pick up the heat
turn it into either uh into electricity or or even just into heat uh and do it here and there
all over the planet that that would be huge and and next an even more
of a long shot is naturally occurring hydrogen hydrogen is obviously going to be incredibly
useful but but getting it is energy intensive so that really in the current state of affairs
it's more like a battery than than a source of energy but naturally occurring hydrogen of course
is a is is a source of energy and uh we don't know it in in 10 years it will probably be a
done deal we'll know that it that it's not a workable impressive component but it may be
and so that's that's pretty thrilling and and then we have fusion there are maybe now 40
diverse efforts different efforts and it's the it's the difference that makes it interesting
I think one or two of them may well make it uh from an engineering technology point of view
in a few decades and that is again an infinite source of energy what I worry about
we have a few investments what I worry about for them is that by the time they make it
it may turn out that wind solar and storage has made so much steady progress or that geothermal
and naturally occurring hydrogen has that they will not be necessary that the capital cost will
be too high to compete but but it may be fine and we have to do it we need we need to try everything
so I have a lot of follow-ups to that um if you were just an investor I might leave it uh uh at
what you just said but I know you also are aware of the work of Patrick Ophuls uh and um ecologist
William Reese who are both on my podcast friends of mine and technology itself is necessary but
not sufficient to solve some of the larger issues and climate change from an ecological
perspective isn't the problem it's a symptom of a much larger problem which is overshoot
so in addition to technological green uh investments we're also going to need
something on the cultural and and political side otherwise the productivity from these new
improvements that you're um advocating and hoping for will just be fed back into a global
energy and resource consumptive system if GDP is our goal what are your thoughts about that
nearly infinite cheap green energy is a very helpful but not sufficient condition
I do not think there is any hope of uh creating a degrowth culture
profound enough or quickly enough to save our bacon I do think we can tip it slowly
on the margin in that direction what I think may save the day is population
population particularly in the high resource areas is dropping rapidly and by population
standards it's nose diving and nobody really appreciates the speed at which it's dropping
to take the extreme case the career has a fertility rate south korea of 0.8 last year
and and not much higher the five years before that at 0.8 it means in three generations 100 years
your baby cohort will be six and a half percent of what it is today basically you're out of business
and if I am right in what I see as the reasons for this it is highly likely
that the population of high energy high resource using rich countries and china will be substantially
lower in let us say by 2020 200 I am I think we could drift down to about two billion people
which we could sustain and it's only that piece of incredible you could say good luck if we can
hold the system together under the stress of going to two billion people combined with nudging us
towards a deep growth philosophy and understanding that we have to restructure ourselves to live
within our limits that gives us a decent chance of making it and to have cheap green energy
would make a big improvement in the arts so let me clarify something so the global population
is still increasing the global population growth rate I think peaked in 1965 and has been declining
ever since then but we are still net births over deaths is around plus 80 million humans
per year and that's declining but it's still growing the total population so are you saying
because Elon Musk has a much different perspective he thinks global population decline
is the biggest risk that humans face so population is do we have too many people or not enough
and and how do you marry those two views I'm I'm only interested in births because in the end
accumulating retirees doesn't really matter the long-term well-being of the species depends on
on young people except there are some people in your sphere that that are advocating for longevity
and that we're gonna with AI and other things we're gonna live to be 120 or 130 which would
also have an ecological impact if that comes to pass for for 60 70 years I mean the fact is
they die off the the dynamics that matter are the dynamics of young people and how many children
they have you can have an army of old people and and and that long-term significance is is
negligible uh once you know the flight path of babies you know the flight path of 20 year olds
you know the flight path of the economy yes there is a risk that dropping at this speed will stress
out the the economy and we will in 20 years think that we're poor and and and that we can't afford
to do the necessary things on the environment to to protect our existence that would be
that would be very sad on the other hand if AI is half as good as some people believe it will
mesh very well with a rapid decline in in workforce and we will have a rapid decline in
workforce I rather hope there is a brilliant development in AI so they can look after the
old folk and and so on and and life will go on uh holding holding together that's the big trick
can we hold together to 2200 to arrive in a world where there are two billion people including the
old fogies uh and where we could be a world where at least half of the land is rewilded
and we're living in eventually within our needs and it may not be two billion it may be one billion
it may be two and a half but it's going to be something like that I know that the the advocates
of AI uh who are aware and concerned about climate change do think that AI can solve climate
change and for the same reason I mentioned before jevons paradox artificial intelligence can make
things more efficient and do demand side management for our energy use and all those things but it
can't do at least not AI maybe AGI um it can't do wisdom so it's not going to change
our cultural objective or cultural aspirations and I actually think the declining labor force
which you're talking about is from uh smaller baby cohorts AI is going to do that because it's
going to take people's jobs away and so I think there's a real wealth and income inequality risk
with AI that um that gets thrown into this picture as well do you have any thoughts there
yes I'm on this topic rather pleased with myself because 15 years ago I I wrote a little piece
about the uh the country club on the beach being served by androids and the uh the last human
supervisor slash helpers has just been uh talked about in a in a message that one of the androids
has sent to his fellows that that fred um a nice guy as he is is really starting to get in the way
and and after that point that there is no productivity per man hour there is only productivity
per robot hour or if you will return on capital and the capital owners sit in the country club
and around the perimeter one might think barbed wire there are hordes of other humans who have no
job and are therefore totally useless and worthless etc etc hoping for some handouts from the country
club and and that the the real job of government in AI is is a income dispersion job uh let let us
imagine that world in 300 years when we've been really lucky and have survived all these other
existential threats and uh the robots are doing all the work um do the capital owners get everything
do the rest just disappear and starve or long before that do they revolt and get put down by the
robots or vice versa and so on but an enlightened government will move to head that stuff off pretty
quickly by making sure that there is a fairly broad acceptable income distribution and we are
already falling foul of that our income distribution uh in the US is no longer passing that test
it has resulted in the estrangement almost bitterness and anger of at least a third of the
general public who feels they have been badly treated and i think you could make a pretty good
case that yes they have been royally screwed since about 1975 that's why i'm less sanguine on some of
these electric car um forecasts and things like that because as of now as the sugar high from
the covid stimulus is waning i think i saw a stat last week that 50 of americans cannot afford a car
payment at today's rates with higher interest rates uh built in so um you know we're one of the
richest nations in the world but um the the wealth is certainly not evenly distributed right and uh
if you think of car payment much more important really is house payment and um buying a house
it's such a high unaffordability index now peak prices as a multiple of family income times 7.8
percent mortgage you're sitting there down in washington with a mortgage of 2.7 real story uh
it's pretty hard to move to boston at 7.8 or 7.9 that is a brutal increase in your cost so cars houses
and and and real life this is this is not a a super comfortable world for everyone
below half halfway on the income scale and it's not that great in the last 30 years from
from the 50th percentile till about the 20th it's been great for the point one
so uh most people think that um all capitalism is the same thing but you frequently pointed out
that american capitalism is unique um what what do you mean by this and and what are the alternatives
and and ultimately i want to get to is there a different way that we can um allocate capital our
scarce capital which is energy resources and our impact on ecosystems going forward uh what are
your thoughts on that we have fallen in many ways on bad times from about 1975 from from about 1930
to 75 everybody got richer at about the same rate there was a very slight tendency for the poorer
to outgrow the richer uh and so by about 1965 to 75 we reached a by american standards anyway a
rather egalitarian level and uh people frequently quote the the uh fortune 500 CEOs earning 40 times
which turns out to be about what the japanese CEOs were earning too and and now uh 50 years later
the japanese CEOs earned 40 or 50 times their worker average worker and and we yield um about
250 to 400 depending on who's doing the calculating but it is you have to say obscene it's unnecessary
too most of these people are of very average uh qualities that you know the people who start their
own darn firm like mr musk and and in a sense they they deserve what they get uh people who start a
new enterprise you know when you paid all the rent and you paid all the salaries what's left is yours
i get that that's capitalism it's the best part of capitalism when when you put a bunch of your
buddies on the board and you decide to give yourself you know 200 million dollars of stock
options over three years uh because they're your friends that that isn't capitalism that is
the stock option culture um gone wrong and um it it has been aided and embedded by
increasing monopoly every every industry in america has become more concentrated
and in more recent years you have had the fashion of cutting back on capex you know capex is real
life it's it's up and down it's unpredictable it it makes your earnings volatile who needs
who needs capex so let us use that money to buy our stock back buying stock backs is said to be a
dividend it has many dividend like qualities but it has one incredibly significant difference
and that is a dividend goes neutrally to everybody and and stock buybacks
uh uh constantly take out the least optimistic of your stockholders and if you can find a way
month in month out of getting rid of your least optimistic stockholders you better believe
you're living in a different world from a bland universally delivered dividend and so you push
the stock price up and and and the evidence is completely compatible with that view a combination
of all these things has has increased the inequality has enabled the excessive payment
of most CEOs who to be friendly bring along a handful of their top management with them
and bear bear down quite hard and and uh quote efficiently uh or half hard heartedly you could
argue if you were a humanitarian they bear down on on the workers and uh and in that the government
has helped them along the government has allowed the inequality the giny ratio uh to worsen in the
u.s through every administration except bill clinton's where it was flat he did not generate
enough momentum to send the pendulum swinging back a bit but he held it for eight years and and uh
nobody else including obama did they they it continued to become more unequal and in more
recent years of course the whole tax structure has been moved away from capital therefore by
default to labor uh if you lower the tax on dividends and interest and capital gains tax
you must understand that you are increasing it on everything else which is to say the ordinary people
and uh that that has been a very profound transition we are now as unequal as mexico
and brazil and we used to use them back in the 60s and 70s as kind of the robber barons and now
we're with them it's not that they have improved it's we have joined them in a equally unequal
society well tying that back to what you said earlier about 2002 started a tripling in commodity
prices that had uh that acted as a tax on our society uh and to stick our fingers in the
dyke as it were we went to debt and central banks started to uh grow their balance sheet
and via i think it's called the cantillon effect uh that those that are closest to the monetary
spigot gets the most benefits that benefited asset holders and not the general public um
so we're papering over our economic problems with with central bank reactions but it's not
helping the average person it's it's more going to the people who are ready are our asset holders
yeah i i don't see it as papering over but it is undeniable that if you push up the price
of assets through pushing down interest rates you will increase inequality because the rich
own the assets and the poor do not and that is precisely what happened and i think the federal
reserve has played the biggest role in doing that green span and his uh it appears almost as
acolytes since then they have all followed pretty much his his uh flight path so yes that
increases inequality and when you when you lower the rates you also make debt available
to people who can handle borrowing that is to say private equity and and hedge funds
and leverage in general that is a uh windfall game uh you're giving free money for these marginal
economic activities and the only purpose in which really when you look at the bottom line
is the enrichment of the people who run the private equity firms that the value created
for society is negligible according to almost every academic study and and they have they have
pretty good lives but uh and they are some of the main beneficiaries and and they do change
they change reality by making by bidding up the price of corporations and helping increase
the overpricing of the stock market how would the united states um as the example of of where we
both reside at the moment how could we shift away from american capitalism and is even possible
or would it have to happen during a crisis or are there policies and ways that that we could
change it ahead of a a big financial crisis it used to be considered for example that a
a stock buyback was uh manipulative and it was illegal until the mid-70s or later
all the way from the 1930s uh you know you have to have a policeman at the corner of
broad and wall in order for things to work pretty well you have to keep an eye on them and uh
other things being even to have companies buy their stock back whenever they feel like it and and
it it's um it's not a great idea i think let them pay a dividend but let them keep their
nose out of the stock market it is too easily manipulated and was banned for a very good reason
and was unbanned for also a very comprehensible reason which was to be nice to corporations
and it is nice to corporations and it's a big part of the inequality uh equation
but then you have reform of the fed i think the fed has been given far too many responsibilities
if it was just responsible for making sure there was a decent amount of money available
to deal with the economy of that age and and allow quote the government to uh to have to
worry about other things but to have the fed worried about inflation about growth about this
unemployment and dumb it's to pretty well guarantee it will settle for some simple
policy of making rates cheap rates cheap was terrible for retirees they were not getting
paid anything after adjustment for inflation which people have forgotten all about after 20 years
they they they were being charged for the privilege of putting their money into fixed income
and everyone had told them that as they got older they should have more and more
as a percentage in fixed income and suddenly for the last 15 years they have had little or no return
until today suddenly they're now getting paid they they're awash with money uh these people
in compared to where they were two years ago they you know they're getting five six percent seven
percent whereas they were getting nothing uh a few minutes ago so i think reform of the fed
and no stock uh buy bags and i i would be even careful about stock options uh pay people an
honest amount of money on which they pay an honest tax and if you think they're great pay them a lot
of money but stock options stock grants stock buy bags has created in the real world i think
a kind of rather nasty stew that is in favor of the top handful i wouldn't mind reforming boards
too to make sure they had one or two worker representatives in the larger corporations
and and uh one or two outsiders and not not wall-to-wall friends of the chairman
or or maybe uh one or two stand-ins uh conceptually as members of other species who have no say
in our economic decisions yeah yeah by the way when people say to me what should america do
my semi-frivolous
answer is we should hand over hand over our government to a consortium of the scandinavian
countries norway finland danmark sweden lord knows they have to get elected they have on paper all
the problems that we have in that respect and yet they have sensible policies aimed at the well-being
of their people on social measures they do better in everything than we do the life expectancy in
sweden 30 years ago was two years longer and now it's eight years longer when do we when do we blow
the whistle and say something is going drastically wrong but if you look at any measure uh educational
achievement uh number of women who die in childbirth everything you could list they score better
i i was just there in stock home and i was really impressed and there's just a different
feeling there jeremy uh in europe more generally as well but in in scandinavia for for sure um
let let me ask you this i i didn't plan on asking you this but it's it bothers me a lot
um it seems our current uh culture self-selects for candidates for national political office
senators congressmen presidents it almost self-selects for sociopathic type personalities that
care about themselves in a narcissistic profit connection power sort of way and we've gone very
far away from i want to help this country because i i i feel obligated to i feel a fiduciary to making
the future better like a real civic responsibility can the politicians that we have now understand
the type of things that you're saying um you mentioned earlier enlightened politicians
which in our current society seems like an oxymoron to me um what are your thoughts on that
is there hope that we could have a different system that is commensurate with not only the
financial and resource risks that you've pointed out but the ecological and climate ones as an
individual i tend to agree with the tone of what what you're saying but um how we would get there
i haven't a clue can we get there i haven't a clue um it is disturbing and um one one should feel
discouraged and i do but i have no idea what to do about it well i think politicians uh get to be
politicians because they're elected by people so i think we need a cultural shift but we also need
institutional change so based on what you were earlier uh saying does there need to be a fundamental
change in the way business is done as an alternative to the mega corporations uh
inter multinational corporations centered around just shareholder shareholder value
in addition to the reducing stock options and the board restrictions that you mentioned earlier
like fundamentally extraction of finite non-rubber resources turned to concentrated
profits is kind of our homo sapiens 2020s model um does that need to be shifted and how
it feels like a huge hill doesn't it that we've got to push this rock up and um
um how how do you how do you improve things this basic
that they're rather disturbing fact for me is that the older i've gotten
the more aware i've become of how little processed information the average guy has
um he's concerned with or she but making a living paying the rent
bombarded by political views particularly now in in the in the world of x and so on
and and uh i'm extremely sympathetic um in general from a financial point of view they've
been very badly treated but the the the level of processed information of just what passes for
the hardest facts we can get out there is so little appreciated appreciated it reminds me of
the famous quote from Churchill about you know if you want to be frightened about the future of
democracy try five minutes with the average voter um that will do it and um
how how do you address that and it's the work of many decades and many governments
all trying to be modestly sensible and uh what what is the social contract in a nutshell
that's the bottom line how responsible for our neighbor's well-being do we feel
how willing to sacrifice a bit for the well-being of of everybody are we and the answer is not as
much as we used to you know back in the day particularly in world war two everyone pulled
together everyone knew they had to give up this that and the other because it was necessary
because it was necessary and everybody did and they were not unhappy um so i i grew up as a little
kid in world war two and it was people spoke to each other a whole lot more than they did i am told
than they did a bit later and it certainly seemed in many ways like a fairly cheerful
era because everyone was uh suffering but everyone was suffering together everyone was
trying hard almost everybody had a job uh etc etc and and and the social contract was was very
strong and the same in the u.s u.s u.k and and uh it's pretty strong in in scandinavia it's very
strong in japan you know in japan got to tell you this story because that government was incompetent
on in my opinion on covid it went out of its way and only two respects and said you absolutely do
not have to wear a mask if you don't want to you absolutely do not have to be vaccinated if you
don't want to it's your complete civic right to do what you want and and they and that was their
contribution and what did the japanese people do they all wore masks and then they all got
vaccinated and they had the oldest population in the world and we know that was the main variable
for catching covid and they had one in 20 they had five percent of the death rate that the u.s had
amazing demonstration of social cohesion looking after each other and also being generally fit
and and leaner than we are which is also again part of in a way part of the social contract
sensible behavior i have a bunch of more questions uh for you i i just want to thank you um briefly
i know you're very humble uh on your contributions but these are the type of conversations our culture
needs because i'm not humble you're not humble well you're you're humble relative to other people
like you that i know um we'll we'll say that i instead i don't i don't see i don't see giving
money away as as uh philanthropy because i'm not i'm not giving it to help the poor i'm not giving
it to the hospitals not giving it to the schools right i am saying we have a problem we the people
my grandchildren let us do whatever we can to stay afloat and you know poverty will always be
with us and i do care about it but my limited resources better focus on what i think the most
likely thing is to derail the whole society i consider everything we have spent to be defensive
defensive for my family and and in a sense everyone else gets a free ride so i i wouldn't
want you to construe this as as fabulous philanthropy i consider it sensible long-term behavior
for me and mine and and for everyone i'm interested in fair enough i i didn't say you were uh um
generous i said you were a humble um you don't call attention to your own uh accolades but the
reason i wanted to give you that that praise is because our culture rewards and uh lads financial
and economic success and so you are uh very successful in that realm and yet you're putting
most of your investments your your wealth into climate research climate tech because you've
determined that that is our existential risk but beyond that you also care about bird loss
and endocrine disrupting chemicals and and many other environmental issues so my my reason for
calling it out is you're one of the very few financial icons that is talking deeply about
our environmental risks and i i wish more people would integrate that into their business decisions
into their values and into their philanthropy that's the point i was making there i don't get why
so few people with money do not realize the opportunities they have to improve the situation
and how desperate it is that they do that i just don't get it because they're smart
and this is not rocket science this is really obvious i i'm also very big on toxicity and
and we should and i know you've covered it in a few appear yeah so so so shana swan was one
of my first guests and i know you you funded her research on on sperm decline why don't
why don't you talk about that a bit jeremy yeah and and and she talks about it wonderfully well
which is part of the reason we support her uh but people don't realize that toxicity is i believe
moving faster than climate change and and will be more deadly what we have done is we have created
a world which is hostile to life in almost every form including our own
to take in saves the the biomass is down at least 50 percent maybe as much as 75
just the weight of all of those little critters if you talk to an insect expert
too late for you to have a podcast with eo wilson but together with two of my colleagues
i i badged him for about three hours until he was obviously a week but he couldn't get away because
it is exciting always when you're talking to people who are thrilled by what you've spent your
life doing and we were asking him can i give us some proof of the damage that will be done as
insects implode and they're dropping at almost two percent a year anyone who knows anything about
compounding knows that that is catastrophic and he believed profoundly he was the ant man he believed
that if we lost insects now we would probably go out of business ourselves and he couldn't prove it
why couldn't he prove it because there hadn't been many research programs there was no money
in insects no funding and and the interaction of all the insects is one of the most colossally
complicated systems out there and very very hard to study but in almost every environment we we
measure a great loss of insects similarly if you look at human sperm count it's dropping at the same
rate of of insects between one and a half two percent a year and what we did because we can
because we're not academics when the first shana swan report came out uh with hagi levine
that's kind of co co-boss we rapidly extended it backwards and forwards we extended it backwards
to 1945 the age of ddt and so on uh hugely damaging for insects hugely damaging for humans
and we extended it back at half the the rate that they had proven from 1973 to 2017 and then
we extended it forward for six years at just the same rate despite the fact that hagi levines
said that if anything it seemed to be accelerating and then we did fund the program for them to
back it up for six years and they found that indeed it was accelerating so our extension had been
conservative and we used half the rate back to 1945 which is almost certainly conservative
and our total which we'd been using for years before they managed to do the follower
showed that there was a 60 percent from 1945 to 2021 when we were talking about it the 60
drop in in the sperm count in the developed world and and you can say and china and what that means
is it's real trouble now we were over engineered i like to say like a victorian bridge so
dropping to fit to almost 50 40 50 didn't matter but beyond that it suddenly started to
matter a lot and we have gone from a rounding era of young couples having trouble getting pregnant
to about 15 percent and the international health guys come out the other day and say it's one in
seven which is exactly what we agree with what they didn't have the nerve to say was that 30 years
earlier it was pretty well zero that it had gone from nobody having trouble to one in seven having
trouble and it's accelerating at two percent a year which means come back in 20 years and there
will be hell to pay for ordinary people around the world having children and this is all because
of the stuff that was covered in shana swan episode two i think that there's so many endocrine
disruptors i believe the data suggests that pesticides on fruit and vegetables are the
main culprit pesticides on fruit and vegetables eaten by pregnant women are probably half of all
the damage done by chemicals to to humans and it is it is an enormous amount there were a couple
of studies that looked at men at harvard and mass general arguably best hospital or a candidate
in america and yes there were only like 800 of them but for six months they looked at them whether
they were eating more chemicals or less chemicals based on the kind of fruit self reported and the
top quartile had twice the sperm count of the bottom quartile and then the following year they
did women having trouble showing up at the clinic and the ones who had the best diet
uh had 65 successful births and the ones who had in the worst quarter had had 38 just shocking
amazing with that kind of power in the data yes you should have huge follow-up studies no money
no follow-up studies but uh it suggests that we're on our way out of business and that's
what high guy levine says it seems that we're going out of business at this rate 20 30 40 years and
we hit the fan bang and and it scrambles everything else we talk about nate everything we're
obsessing about it is affected by this by this shocking drop in in fertility so you you you
were probably not surprised to know that i have many follow-up questions uh to that so i know you
know shana and supported her work her recent paper her latest paper which was released after the
podcast i did with her a showed that the sperm drop is accelerating and b that it's not just a
united states thing it's it's global right and and does it also extend to non-humans like uh to
animals they covered that a little bit in the first study that there were some footnotes that
suggested that dogs had been tested and that they were just the same having just the same trouble
but we we can deduce from insect problems that that is a major impact we can also sadly deduce
from the insects that we we are in the cascade effect that ear wilson and the rest of them have
so worried about which is to say the best study was in germany where they had thousands of citizen
uh helpers many of whom had phd's and so on by the way and they were amazingly Germanic and
thorough in their study and they put out these nets in exactly the same part of the forest you
know on the same day of the year sort of thing and they and they gathered them all and they were
just amazed over the passage of decades how quickly they all declined it was like an 85
percent decline yes uh germany has not been particularly badly behaved in the last 20 years
what is happening in my opinion is that they are paying the price now for the massive
breakup of the countryside that went on in world war one and world war two where they were kind of
in a sense blockaded and beginning to starve and growing food wherever they possibly could
and breaking down what had been very extensive forests in germany and and and growing food
and that that has made germany just less fitting for insects and then you you tend to pull
of the amount of pesticides you're throwing at it bear in mind this study was done in forest
preserves so you you have to have such a mass of chemicals that it's blowing in the wind
running in in the streams and even in the rain to some extent uh and and and then you have the
temperature and the temperature has very little effect in germany but at the same time they did
a study in potorico and we spoke at great lengths very quickly to the per person who did that study
so early that he was uh very very happy to talk to us and later he became quite trendy
but in in this forest preserve set up by the king of spain hundreds of years ago in potorico
what they found was almost certainly that heat is making tropical insects sterile in the tropics
the temperature varies very seldom so they have a spiking heat you know one or two days a year
and suddenly it's 12 days a year and this bright spark at the university of east anglia
grabbed one of these tropical beetles and started to experiment with heat and he exposed them to
a week of of abnormal heat and and they their fertility rate halved and then after a couple
of weeks to recover they gave them another week and they were sterile um and that element is going
on in the tropics where it will be of course deadly because they are having this huge increase
in extreme hot days and it is making the insects sterile and so all over brazil the insect mass
will be dropping just as fast i know shana and many people in her network um our friends of mine
one of them is on my board uh and many of them tell me that endocrine disrupting chemical pollution
may be a bigger risk to humans in the future than climate change so wouldn't it be something
if the biggest danger of a barrel of oil and natural gas isn't the emissions but is the plastics
and related things that that come from it how can this be happening with so few people in the world
everyone's focus on GDP and consumption and Netflix and smorgasbord and vacations
miss the fact that we are undergoing ecocide of the world's insects which are trillions of
tiny robots doing tasks that humans could never replace by ourselves yeah it is
it is an incredible almost unbelievable description of
homo sapiens that we would be so reluctant to face up to reality which is in a sense freely
available the data is there it's very high quality data is peer reviewed it's done over and over again
my conclusion is if we do not end up banning most chemicals including plastics oh we will
go out of business by that you mean human extinction yeah human the the loss of a reasonably
stable global civilization that we may have pockets and so on here and there but what we
know of as a reasonably acceptable life will be will be gone and there are parts where people
are not exposed to chemicals and and and they will do much better but they are exposed to heat
and and and some of those very parts the heat and the humidity will get so bad that that they
will not be able to exist in the open air doing agriculture so they might become hunter-gatherers
kind of in the in the pockets where they can deal with the humidity keeping the shade and so on
and live off fruit and nuts but life will life will be tough but for the stock market by the way
long before then you have a situation where owning chemicals will be more exposed to lawsuits
than even oil companies which is a very high hurdle because they're getting sued all over
the place now because they knew and and they paid money to obfuscate their knowledge just like the
tobacco companies did and they may have cost us 10 or 15 years or more and for that
they should pay a lot to help us get out of the hole that they that they have helped us dig
deeper than we would without of them without them but if I look around my office pretty much
everything that I'm looking at with the exception of maybe a a glass drinking jar has plastic in it
how would we remotely begin to use bamboo and hemp and and other products to replace the
ubiquity of of plastics in our current system it boggles the mind I have an advantage over you
all in that I remember being in my bathtub as a about a four-year-old three-year-old and my mother
came in with a little Bakelite sailing ship for my bathtub and this was a mottled brown plastic
boat and that was the first plastic that came across my life Bakelite was effectively one of the
first one or two plastics ever made thermosetting hard not flexible soft like polyethylene and
everything around me as in everything everything we fought a damn war with had no plastics guys
it can be done and it is amazing how good we are at sucking it up and replacing
and making do when we have to and this is something that most people in our business
Nate underestimate they they think we all kind of lie down and die because we can't have
our luxuries and our two showers a day and our plastics and it just ain't going to be so we're
going to be tough as nails pretty damn quickly and we're going to get by and we're going to replace
we can replace plastics we know that because we lived in a pre-plastic world quite recently
and we're going to have to find a way of using materials from nature and again you can't grow
and do that it stresses out we don't have the capabilities the resources but if they're combined
with a declining population we very well may so we have to replace petro plastics with bioplastics
and like cellulosic fibers and so on and we can do that and have done it and and the potential for
more discoveries are are massive we can have a vats of microbes doing photosynthesis and and
producing a cellulosic sludge or a material sludge and and my semi-joke is you then build
buildings out of cross laminated sludge having stiffened it up a bit with this and that but it
has to be biologic and industrial scale biologic material and food you know it doesn't sound very
appetizing but you can have microbes generate protein sludge and you can have raspberry flavored
protein sludge guaranteed not to have any plastics guaranteed not to have any toxins
and we can do this we can combine technology and all the accumulated learning of you know
thousands of years to the task at hand and if we do that we will make it and if we're dopey and slow
we won't make it it it is as i like to say the race of our lives but we do have a chance of making
it you're a hedge fund manager lifelong investor but also a philanthropist although you you say that
that's selfishly for your own family and grandchildren to have a livable biosphere
but but given what we face and the things we've discussed on this call of biophysical limits
climate endocrine disrupting chemicals changing geopolitics do you have advice
for other philanthropists or investors who have benefited from living through a unique
period of the carbon pulse but who may just be starting to open their eyes to the broader
uh the ecocide that is uh slowly but picking up speed happening in our world with respect to
animals and insects and ocean and co2 in the atmosphere i mean this is the only habitable
planet known in the universe this blue green earth we all inhabit do you have advice for other
people who've been successful on where the world needs support that's being overlooked
if you have money and you are getting older i i can assure you that this is the retirement
project of all retirement projects it is capable of absorbing any unit of energy you can find
it is absolutely fascinating it has all the great important issues
and a lot of the people who are suddenly sitting on vast pools of money are very smart
technologically savvy they are ideally suited for playing a role in this area
and and they will enjoy it it it will be part thrilling challenging exhausting discouraging
encouraging all of the above but it will not be boring you will not be reduced to playing too much
golf um it it is a great project and and it's the only one that it's the issue that matters most
let's put it that way by the way i'm not a fund manager i i play i play no role in investing
other than the meta-level issues of should you invest in climate change should is there a bubble
i i haven't come close to managing a hedge fund really ever i've only done big issue
top-down topics most of my life and and some traditional stock picking long ago
just to get the record straight record is straight thank you for that so i agree with
you there is no other greater ask for society right now than the human predicament as it pertains
to the natural world and and where we've arrived however the financial system which you know well
is optionality on power and resources and as long as we have a fungible reserve currency
in the world currently the dollar that dollar as you maximize it and grow the amount of it
is a claim on everything else that you can quickly turn it into land or a different currency or
ownership in a company and so to do the right thing for nature and our children and the biosphere
uh reduces one's optionality i i told you i used to work at salomon brothers and i had clients that
had 300 million dollars and they were going to get to 500 million and they would quit but when
they got to 500 million their buddies had more and it was a compulsion to grow the amount of assets
so how does that dynamic merge with growing recognition of the unbelievable tragedies that
unfolding in the natural world nat i think i think it's an unanswerable question from my
from my perspective it is too profound and philosophical for my skill set so i am going
to dug that one it's it's the right question but i am not the right person to answer it
okay i will ask a related question um i know that you also fund uh work at universities
especially on climate so i'm going to start asking this question of all my guests because
it's my belief that young humans especially those in grad school or postdocs are an incredible
underutilized human resource to tackle some of the problems that you've uh uh integrated on this
call so but they're working within an economic structure within the academy that is kind of
linear and doesn't integrate the things that we've been discussing so in your field climate
oceans endocrine disrupting extinctions how all that fits together can you some can you suggest
some really big questions for postdocs grad students universities around the world that need
research need answers that are happening right now what is really the threat uh in uh epigenetic
problems changing the way that genes express themselves after exposure to uh to chemicals
we really have to follow that out we really have to follow up the sperm count studies and
what can be done what is causing the damage they really don't know you know shana thinks it's mainly
the forever chemicals i think it's mainly pesticides on fruit and vegetables and
it it isn't known but we we should have important follow-up studies the same with insects we may
be taking we may be teetering on the edge of our own destruction and we just don't know it
because no one has ever funded insect research and you could take all our money throw it at any
one of these things and and it would kind of still be a drop in the bucket although
it it would certainly help we have decided to to throw all our money in a sense at
at green tech research because we think it buys us time for governments and new rich people to
get the point and start to change the way they spend their money and the way yeah the government
spends its money buy buy time through technology to push the window away before we go off the cliff
but as as you kind of implied these are not long-term cures these are just buying time
for for the long-term actions to be taken and and the most impressive one to me is a population
reduction that that i think is pretty well baked in the pie we we didn't cover one thing which is
the shockingly politically incorrect and therefore we should probably do it and that is
the the main reason for population
crash it's not a population crash because of the old fogies living longer but it's a
baby cohort crash the main reason is a choice obviously more educated women are realizing that
that many children just impinge on their the flexibility of their life and the
and their ability to kind of fully realize themselves anyway so we have this huge correlation
between female education and and and fertility and secondly postponement everyone wants quite
correctly to get their career going before they interrupt it and that makes a lot of sense but
when you postpone you're not nearly as fertile and i believe it interacts with toxicity in a
non-linear way so it doesn't really matter if you have some toxic exposure when you're a 16-year-old
a Nigerian just to pick on a place with a very high fertility rate because you have many years
to make it up but you know you're you're 39 year old Parisian worker you you may find you simply
can't have it have a child so that's reason number two the reason number three is toxicity
reduced sperm count increasing miscarriages and all of the lesser problems that come with chemical
exposure which is getting worse rapidly and will soon be overtaking postponement into second place
and then there is the one that no one talks about and that is in addition to the measurable
reduction in sperm count etc there is a hard to measure effect on hormone interference on
your willingness your eagerness to procreate every study i as far as i'm aware and i've tried to
look at them every every study on sexual activity says it's going down in each age group
pregnancies in 16 year olds and younger dropping rapidly that's a lack of willingness to procreate
or a lack of willingness to do the act that results in procreation no a lack of interest
in in procreation you in other words you are not motivated you you're not the 22 year old
of circa 1955 you have less interest and
that was available implication of of of the study from from Shana Swan and Haggai Lavigne
and and it may be the most powerful force of all you know 40 percent of south korean 40 year
olds have not had a child and and the activity in terms of dating and so on has has really dwindled
down so that it's the women's night out and the guys playing competitive computer games on a saturday
night and not going to the bar and and hooking up or whatever we call it um this is i think
potentially very profound and maybe the most important single consequence of chemical exposure
but is that can that be described by chemical exposure or could it also be described by the
subconscious recognition of climate change and uh limits to growth and other things that people
just don't have that inner freedom and a spree decor of of of discovery and all that that there's
there's just a a paul and that we've become the walking worried i i don't know well i i can
hazard a strong guess i would as a betting man i would put a very large bet on this
in the community in which we move we bump into people who fall into into your description
uh as a percentage of young people i think they are pretty small and confined to certain
countries and socioeconomic groups in china for example i would expect that to be a very small
fraction of of the opinion but the the uh the proof of the pudding is that in in the career japan
china and and probably when measured correctly india um they're all acting as if um forget the
choice i i'm just not interested and that that component is accelerating and that of course is
a real threat to the species and and i think this is a real threat to the species but it it cuts
right across all the other things we're working on doesn't it uh if if our population is going to
turn out to be substantially less than the low estimate of the un by 2100 in just 70 years and
then much less by 2200 the main the main things we have to worry about maybe is holding society
together the demand for all the bad things like oil and copper will will will drop like stone but
the stress on society and the economy will be pretty high i don't know enough about that i'm
going to have to look into that um but you're right it would affect everything else including
the paying back of of debt that is such an important point um about the payback of debt
you know i i started out life studying big american industrial corporations who were in
decline international harvester and the retirees had certain obligations and the workforce supporting
them were declining the company was declining but the retirees was were static and and that is
a very similar echo here but in the following way the thing we haven't talked about
is the cost of doing what we have to do we think it's 50 trillion increment to green the economy
and the reason it's so low is because you have to buy a car anyway you have to build a new factory
anyway you have to build up upgrade the grid anyway and you combine that with greening it
and so it's a relative bargain 50 maybe 75 trillion dollars um you then have the accumulated
damage which between now and 100 years is probably going to be somewhere in the range of
30 to 100 trillion it's a very wide error bar how can we put a price tag on insects or ecosystems
or the i'm just talking i'm just talking about floods okay floods droughts and and food problems
in other words old-fashioned simply measured pain which is going through the roof as we as we sit
but but 10 years ago was really quite marginal and and and the biggest one of all
and and that is we're going to have to end up when we get to a zero carbon industrial system
we're going to end up with we believe about 550 parts per million plus or minus 50
that's if we do better try harder and have a steady stream of innovations we started out
life at 280 we're at 420 if we do a better job we might peak this out at 550 but we've got to go
back from 550 to 300 that's 250 parts per million if we don't the ice caps will melt
we'll have 200 feet rise and so on and a lot of the fires and floods and transference of
the amazon to savannah etc will will keep going so we have to do it and when you green the economy
you have a lot of offsetting virtues you you drive as i do a model 3 is the best car i ever got in
you you go through boston in an electrified world in 20 years it's the cleanest boston will have
ever been since its inception it will have huge health payoffs by the way that no one talks about
so there are lots of offsetting virtues but the taking out 250 parts per million is an
absolute dead weight for which you will not see any direct advantage your survival depends on it
but you will not see any immediate payoff like you will with greening the economy and we think
we'll be ingenious and terrific and we'll get the cost down to 50 a ton every and currently 500
a thousand dollars a ton but we'll get it down to 50 that's what we do well when we scale this up
it will be brilliantly cheaper 50 a ton but it's it's a lot of tons and it the total
turns out to be 125 trillion dollars in other words maybe twice as much as greening the economy
and and we're going to take decades to do it and if the population drops steadily we have this
pension fund problem that you're alluding to and that is if if we take a long time and we
probably will if we peak and and at 550 one day and the population is already in terms of the workers
has already halved they have twice the burden and then as they pay for it over 100 years it halves
again by the end they've quadrupled that burden and it's a pretty damn big burden anyway so there
is a unfortunate intersection between a declining population which is good for most things and the
cost of decarbonizing and extracting the excess carbon which will be borne by fewer and fewer
people so i'm going to i'm going to have to have you back to discuss the greening of the economy
because there's so many rabbit holes on that that i would love your your expertise and wisdom on but
for right now let me ask you this what are the most promising ways that you've come across
for actually subtracting carbon from the atmosphere or things on the come that that haven't really been
proven yet that you're optimistic about uh regenerative agriculture geoengineering
cloud seeding marine cloud brightening uh what do you have any opinion or optimism in that field
i am optimistic on everything you mentioned actually i think we will have to get involved into
cloud brightening sort of relatively low risk relative high payoff certainly
geoengineering everything to do with agriculture uh we're desperate we can't be too
careful we can't be we have to be careful but we can't be ultimately careful because we're running out
of time and it's something that we can really do a good job at changing the characteristics
of the agricultural process and plants in general so that they sequester a little more carbon and
and require less energy to to grow and so on one of my favorite down to earth little
down to earth little projects is a robot that runs slowly on its own across the field
gathering about half the corn stubble and converting it a very high temperature in into biochar
the trouble biochar is is wonderful for microorganisms it wonderful for water retention
it really improves the soil and the problem with it is that you have to truck biomass which is fatal
and then when you've converted it into biochar you truck it to a farm and then you distribute it on
the farm it's all horrifically energy intensive but this little machine is there it takes the stubble
right there and converts it to biochar right there and it does it potentially very cheaply
incrementally something close to ten dollars a ton or maybe zero because the value of the soil
enhancement is enough to justify the process and the carbon sequestration which is very substantial
is a free good think about that so that that's a fits in what we call the too good to be true
category that which there are quite a few I keep coming back to we're going to have to
value the natural world more than our current economic system does and that is going to take
money and it's going to take money and resources away from stock car driving or Las Vegas
junkets or Disneyland or other things in the society so who is going to pay for that is it
going to be investors or governments or is it a cultural value shift that each of us tithe
10% of our income above a certain amount towards the natural world because then I think there's a
lot more things that become possible among the things you mentioned but until we get to that
point we're just outsourcing our wisdom to the financial market and the financial market
optimizes capital and not the environment yes and we will either improve starting
with the social contract our attitude to we're all in this together
or we will in the end probably fail in the meantime we're saying to ourselves
that is a big ask and one with uncertain outcome we know we can improve these things
through technology we we know we can make it better we know we can knock years off
the research lifespan let us do what we know we can do that fits into a system that works pretty
well the venture capital world is the pride and joy of the american capitalist system in my opinion
it is unlike so many things where far better to be in in in danmark it's far better to be in the
us for venture capital we suck in all the very best people we have 15 of the 20 great research
universities that are integral to the flow of ideas we take risk better than any other group on the
planet with maybe australia closed behind and this is it this is the one little nook and cranny
of the system that is great people are flocking in from around the world into green tech the green
tech world is unlike any other quadrant of capitalism they are actually thoroughly concerned
with the problem and they it's a big part of their driving force that this is an existential
risk that they're doing something about this is really heartening i i joke that they they may
get drummed out of the capitalism club because they have all these benevolent attitudes could
you imagine what green tech and the demographic you just described could accomplish if we had
not only a carbon tax but a tax on all non-renewable inputs to the economy that would give us the
right signals for the downslope of the carbon pulse and then you can apply all that ingenuity
and creativity towards technological responses and there is also the the idea of the circular economy
and in in France they're moving to make it expensive to design things that cannot be
recycled cannot be repaired and and in that sense the the french are odd ducks as we
but they do some things very very well and i think this is such an enlightened
attitude and and a lot of these problems are quite specific so if you if you're in
danmark and you solve the chemical problem you will simply live a lot longer and be healthier
and eventually the other and other people will follow you the trouble with
climate change is it's fungible and there's a free rider effect but we really depend on
these handful of people who will set a good example and prove that it can be done prove that in
fact the economy in france you know 10 years later starts to grow a little faster than the others
because they're insisting on more recycling and and so on a more circular successful economy
last question before i get to the final questions um there was a science article i think around
eight or nine years ago that showed that if the united states went it alone and did the
Paris Accord and did everything correctly for climate that by the year 2100 it would make
an infinitesimal difference into the global uh temperature in other words it has to kind of
be a global thing or it's not going to matter so do you think there's possibility of global
cooperation on climate endocrine disrupting chemicals and other environmental risks or
does it just happen nation by nation and and patchwork way i i fear that it will be patchwork
and in toxicity that works because people can see who is pulling ahead
however i think as things get desperate there is a decent chance that we will start to cooperate
people are you know a little stupid but they're not completely stupid and if if we start to go
to hell in the hand basket will we not start cooperative ventures on on a global carbon tax
equilibrating policy you know where everything every product is treated the same way yes i think
that will happen in even more enlightened stuff it may or may not we are going to make it on on
20 of these questions we're going to make it if we are slightly more to the enlightened side than
the unenlightened side we're we really exist well within a range of success and failure i think
even with our deficiencies we're inventive taken all together we can make it and we can fail
this is very unusual that this is not a done job this is not certain that we will fail it is not
certain by by any means that we will succeed and we will have hundreds of these little choices
where some people will be more enlightened some people will copy them other people will be a
pain in the earth they will send the country back for 10 years and and the sum of all of these will
decide whether we model through or whether we don't that is very well said and that is the
conclusion that i came to when i started this podcast is we need more people to see the game
board and how things fit together so that we can make better decisions and tilt towards the the more
enlightened so final few questions jeremy you've thought about these issues for a very long time
you're 85 years young and you are uber focused on on the things that that really matter do you
have any personal advice to the viewers of this program who are aware of climate change
endocrine disrupting chemicals the the flatness in our economy for the people in the lower
three quintiles etc do you have any personal advice and before i answer that i just want to say
to the average to the typical viewer uh i i have just spent 30 or 40 hours skimming through
and occasionally really listening to nates 95 podcasts and i have by no means
covered covered them but i've tried to select the ones most relevant to me i have a real feeling
for the style and what's going on and and and and let me say this is this is the kind of effort
that if it takes wing you know by the time you've done three or four hundred of these becomes
the authoritative source that people go to get exposed to this line of
of reasoning uh this is one of those things that can tip the scale a bit well thank you for
saying that i i don't i can't imagine doing 300 but i'll keep going of course you can imagine
doing 300 what what what sort of thought is that i have about four people um that you should really
talk to uh but um that's only two or three years from now that should that should be a piece of cake
you should be aiming at a thousand there's just about a thousand useful people to talk to i should
thank uh the advice is this this is um one of the main things in life is purpose and
most people born in the history of man has not have not had particular purpose other than staying
alive we we have an opportunity to not just stay alive earn a living feed yourself but we have an
opportunity to change the outcome for future generations stretching out for more or less ever
and this is the purpose of all purposes you lucky people and if you do not attach yourself
to this problem you are missing the point you are not paying attention you're not being intelligent
you're not showing judgment this is the issue that you should attach as much as your life to
as you can and you know there is something to be said from make as much money as you can
and deploy the money uh to people who know better about other things that's perfectly acceptable
or become an expert in any one of the thousands of of jobs that are required to to make it out of
this mess so it is a wonderful time uh to be to be alive in terms of purpose and for my money
you know purpose is is one of the two or three things that make life worth living i agree um
how would you adjust that advice to a young human 18 to 25 uh listening to this becoming
aware of of these things um sure purpose but do you have any other advice for young humans
yeah i mean it's the same advice really just pick a career that is useful tilt yourself to
science and pick a branch of science that is relevant of which many are to this field if you're
a bit older think about running a startup and and make sure the startup has a chance of being really
important think about getting into green venture capital because you can have some leverage and
raise some money and and and show some scale no there there are plenty of opportunities
that you're this is a fortunate time if you could this is a question i ask all my guests and if you
listen to 20 or 30 of my episodes you know that's if you could wave a magic wand jeremy and there
was no personal recourse to your decision what is one thing you would do to improve human and
planetary futures i suppose that's easy i would wave a magic wand and have the global population
become one billion i like to say that we live at such a finely tuned part of the race of our
lives that if you imagine a world where we have the population of 1900 and the part and the technology
of today we have no problem we've made it if we had the technology of 1900 and the population of
today we're toast we have no hope the whole of this race has played out in the hundred year gap
between population growth and technology it's quite remarkable that's well stated i hadn't
heard it put that way before and and therefore finding yourself at one billion tomorrow i think
we have enough time and resources and talent to muddle our way through this has been quite a
conversation i would like to have you come back maybe as a round table guest or to take
a deeper dive is there a topic that we didn't cover today maybe esoteric but relevant to our
futures that if you were to come back and take a deep dive on that topic does something come to
mind well my my topics are toxicity population and and the viability of the animal world insect
world resource limitations particularly metals energy inequality deficiencies in capitalism
and we did a pretty good job yeah we did of at least getting into some of some of that of each topic
well uh i hope this podcast is and bubbles that's my only other thing and bubbles
well we're in a we're in a numerous bubbles at the moment thank you for thinking and caring
about these things during your career and thank you for your time today and to be continued
i hope and thanks jeremy and and thank you nate the same way thank you for your efforts
