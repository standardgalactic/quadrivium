ü§ñ Answer:
  Cognetics is not explicitly defined in the provided content, but it appears to be a field of study that focuses on magnetism and electricity, differentiating from traditional cognitive science, which typically deals with mind and intelligence. This interpretation is based on the context clues from the text files, including mentions of magnetism, electricity, magnetic fields, and moving electric charges.

But the big picture of magnetism is very different, because the big picture of magnetism is this.
What magnetism is really about, and I'm going to say it big and I'm going to say it loud,
magnetism is about moving electric charge.
Magnetism is about electricity just as much as everything we've done so far in our lectures on electromagnetism,
had been about electricity, because magnetism is fundamentally a phenomenon involving moving electric charge....

So there are no magnetic monopoles.
So then we have to ask the question, if there aren't sort of isolated magnetic north and
south poles, it would be the analogs of electric charge in giving rise to magnetism.
What is the source of magnetism?
So let me remind you again, say it big and loud and clear, what magnetism is all about.
Magnetism is fundamentally about moving electric charge.
And I said it in the previous lecture, moving electric charge responds to magnetic fields,...

of an external magnetic field. Conversely, deoxygenated hemoglobin is paramagnetic. That is,
it will align in the same direction as an external field, but will have no net magnetization
in the absence of an applied magnetic field. Using magnetic resonance imaging,
one can examine a deep region within the cerebral cortex and ascertain its rate of blood flow.
By measuring the time dependence of the variation in magnetization, when the saturating radio...

In summary, magnetism is the result of moving electric charges at various scales, from macroscopic currents in wires to microscopic currents in atoms. Ferromagnetism allows for the creation of permanent magnets and is the most common type of magnetism we experience. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials exhibit weaker forms of magnetism, and electromagnetic induction explains how changing magnetic fields can produce electric currents. Magnetic monopoles remain a theoretical concept as no...
