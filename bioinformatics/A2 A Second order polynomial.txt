to clean up you can either just close all of these because we are now going to just look at
the or you can just press the new new new button but anyway let's carry on we're going to do y
equals ax and then the caret sign which is shift six on most keyboards so the two there and then
the right arrow to move back down plus bx plus c and once again we can do the sliders of all of them
and first of all we notice or we would know that that would represent for us a parabola and once
again we can play around with these if we just look at what c does if we just play with c we see it
moves this lowest point this lowest point would just be would just be moving up and down and when
we play around with b we see what the effect of b is just changing b and we see what the effect of a is
larger a the narrower this parabola becomes and eventually as we get towards zero it becomes
more and more when it is zero that means it's zero x squared which is zero so we left with bx plus c
which is the same as mx plus c and that will just be a straight line and we see what negative values
will do so we can see what the effect if we play around with that you can see what the effect of the
constants a b and c are going to be on on a parabola if we just click on this button here and just add a
new expression and we'll say y equals just type the following in d and then divide it by dx and move the
cursor by the right the right arrow button one across and now we can say let's say x to the power two
so you can do simple derivatives as well and we know the derivative of of x squared is going to be
2x if you have forgotten what derivatives are we'll do a video as far as that's concerned i just want to
show you that you can also do do derivatives and you'll see this line going down through through 0.0
and then where it would intersect note though that the slope of this is 2 the slope of 2 means if i move
one across on the x-axis i'm going to move two blocks up and if i click there you'll see where
the these two lines as they stand now remember it's now y equals 0.42 x squared minus bx minus 3.33
where that in this line 2x intercepts or they intersect i should say that's negative 0.977
i'm just clicking in that vicinity and it'll jump to that point of intersection but play around with
a quadratic formula this is a second order polynomial in as much as the dependent variable x
its highest power is 2 that makes it a second order polynomial there also known as a quadratic
equation we'll see we'll see why later but play around with it and you'll note how things change
