Now that we've had a quick look at simple harmonic oscillation, let's get a bit more
reality into the situation.
If we have our mass hanging on the spring going up and down, it's not going to go up
and down forever.
There are other forces involved here, friction, air resistance.
If we could really develop motion like that, we'd be well on our way to perpetual motion
and free boundless energy and entropy is not going to allow us to do that.
So we've got to get more realistic about the situation and we're going to do damped simple
harmonic motion, damped oscillation.
Now imagine again my spring and my mass hanging from it and it oscillates up and down.
I can well imagine that as it moves down, the velocity is in the downward direction.
Other than the spring just pulling up, what other things can I think about?
One for instance would be air resistance.
Some form of, other forms of dissipation in the spring.
And what I want to model it as, is another force, directly proportional to something.
So imagine I do this experiment and I notice and I can plot very specific points, where
it is at the moment, what its velocity is, and I start to realize that, hey look, there is
some new force and it is proportional to, well let's not call it x prime, this is not a
mathematics class, let's call it x dot.
So the higher the velocity it seems, the higher this retarding force is, and it's in the opposite
direction I do notice.
So if it goes down, if the velocity is higher, there is this higher force in the opposite
direction.
Let's just, let's just use one, let's say air resistance, there is some drag on, on this
in the opposite direction and the faster it goes, the higher that force is, and I do this
experiment and I see there is this direct relationship in the opposite direction.
So I can put a constant of proportionality in there, we'll call it beta in this instance,
x single dot.
So this force, and it's negative, it's in the opposite direction.
So I've got this new force.
So remember, let's call this force number two, remember force number one was just this minus
kx.
We noticed that the further away the spring was, the more this restoring force was.
We saw that there was a direct relationship between this force, also in the opposite direction
than this.
So if we sum up all these forces, according to Newton's second law, we should have this now.
M x double dot equals, well we have a minus, our new one, beta x dot in the minus kx.
That's what we would have now.
So this is now modeling something a lot more realistic and I could have developed this purely
by observing data points if I did this experiment.
And you can well imagine we don't have to rig a whole experiment here, thought experiment,
you can well imagine the reality of what we're trying to do here.
So I can bring all of this to the other side and you'll immediately see it's a second order
ordinary differential equation.
All I need to do, at least one of the methods, is to have a leading constant of one as a coefficient
to this.
So I'm going to end up with x double dot plus beta over m x dot plus k over m x.
And that is a homogeneous second order ordinary differential equation, linear there with constant
coefficients.
That's a constant, that's a constant.
This is my new constant of proportionality.
So this is a constant and I only need to solve that.
People looked at this many centuries ago and say, well, there's an easy way to solve this.
We already know that k over m, just to make things easier in the solution.
Otherwise, we sit with so many of these constants.
Remember, we call that omega squared.
And we're going to make a new constant of proportionality, beta, over m.
We're going to call that 2 lambda.
2 lambda.
That's positive.
That's positive.
Anything squared that would be positive.
If it's a real number and then that's positive.
That's positive.
That's positive.
That's positive.
That all works out well.
So I'm going to have this x double dot plus 2 times lambda x dot plus omega squared.
What did I do now?
Omega squared x.
There we go.
x equals zero.
So there is mine.
I'm just substituting these things because you'll see a bit later that it makes absolute
sense.
Just to write things out.
It keeps track of everything beautifully.
And remember, again, mathematics in physics.
I can write this as d squared plus 2 times lambda d plus omega squared x equals zero.
Because I can really now use the auxiliary equation m squared plus 2 lambda m plus omega squared
equals zero.
And that's just a beautiful polynomial.
And I can get the roots of that polynomial.
And that roots, those roots can be of three types.
They can be real roots and different.
Remember, it's m squared.
So I'm going to get two m values.
So they can be real and different.
And you'll see we'll call that overdamped.
They can be real and equal.
And we'll call that critically damped.
Or they can be imaginary, those roots.
Imaginary numbers.
And we'll call that underdamped.
We'll clean the board and we'll go on.
We'll show these three solutions.
The mathematics behind these three solutions.
Which underlies the physics of damped simple harmonic motion.
