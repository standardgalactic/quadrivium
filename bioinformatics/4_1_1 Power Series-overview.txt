The text discusses the concept of power series in mathematics. A power series is expressed in the form \( b_k (x - c)^k \), where each term involves raising a variable \( x \) minus a constant \( c \) to some power \( k \). The focus is on understanding when these series converge or diverge, which is crucial for applications such as Maclaurin and Taylor series expansions.

The text provides an example using the geometric series, noting its convergence condition when the absolute value of the ratio \( r \) (i.e., \( |x - 2| \)) is less than 1. For a specific case where the series is expressed as \( x - 2 \), it converges to the function \( \frac{1}{3-x} \) for \( x \) between 1 and 3.

The power of power series lies in their ability to approximate complex functions within their radius of convergence. By calculating partial sums (like \( p_0(x), p_1(x), \) etc.), one can get increasingly accurate approximations of a function's graph over its interval of convergence, even if the original function is difficult to handle analytically.

The text emphasizes the importance of tests for convergence because knowing where a series converges allows us to approximate functions effectively within that domain. This capability of representing and approximating complex functions as power series highlights their utility in mathematical analysis and applications like graphing calculators or computer-based graphing software.

The text discusses the convergence of power series and how they can be used to approximate functions within their domain. A power series is expressed as a sum of terms involving powers of \(x - c\), where \(c\) is the center of the series, often zero in simple examples. The focus is on determining where such a series converges using tools like the ratio test.

In this specific case, the power series involves terms \(\frac{k}{3^{k+1}} x^k\). To determine convergence, we apply the ratio test, which examines the limit of the absolute value of consecutive terms in the series as \(k\) approaches infinity. This helps identify a radius of convergence within which partial sums can effectively approximate the original function.

The ratio test involves calculating:

\[
\lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{(k+1)x^{k+1}/3^{k+2}}{kx^k/3^{k+1}} \right|
\]

Simplifying this expression, we find that it reduces to evaluating the limit:

\[
\lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{(k+1)x}{3(k)} \right| = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{k+1}{k} \cdot \frac{x}{3} \right|
\]

As \(k\) approaches infinity, \(\frac{k+1}{k}\) approaches 1. Therefore, the limit simplifies to:

\[
\left| \frac{x}{3} \right|
\]

For convergence using the ratio test, this value must be less than 1:

\[
\left| \frac{x}{3} \right| < 1
\]

Thus, the radius of convergence \(R\) is 3. Within this interval (\(-3 < x < 3\)), partial sums of the power series can approximate the function well and may be easier to differentiate or integrate than the original complex function.

The text emphasizes using these insights for practical applications where approximations are required within a specific domain, demonstrating how simple examples can lead to understanding more complex mathematical phenomena.

The text discusses using the ratio test to determine the convergence of a series involving a variable \( x \). According to the ratio test, for the series to converge, the limit \( l \) (which is determined by the series terms and not directly dependent on \( x \)) must be less than 1. This condition implies that the absolute value of \( x \) must be less than 3, leading to a convergence domain of \( -3 < x < 3 \).

However, it's important to note that the ratio test does not provide information about the behavior of the series at the boundary points \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 3 \). Therefore, you must check these endpoints separately by substituting them into the series to determine if they also converge. If the limit \( l \) equals 1 at these points, additional tests are required to ascertain convergence or divergence.

In summary, while the ratio test establishes a general domain for convergence (\(-3 < x < 3\)), it does not specify what happens at the boundaries, necessitating separate checks for \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 3 \).
