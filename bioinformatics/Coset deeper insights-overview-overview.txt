The text delves into the concept of cosets within group theory. It explains that for a subgroup \( H \) of a larger group \( G \), and an element \( A \) in \( G \), the expression \( AH \) is a left coset, while \( HA \) is a right coset.

The behavior of these cosets is illustrated using Cayley's tables, which help visualize operations within groups. The text examines two cases: when \( A \) is an element of \( H \) and when it is not. If \( A \) belongs to \( H \), it naturally appears in both left and right cosets due to the inclusion of all possible group operation combinations, including the identity element.

When \( A \) is not part of \( H \), the text explains that the intersection of a coset with \( H \) is empty. This is demonstrated through a proof by contradiction: assuming an intersection exists implies \( A \) must be in \( H \), which contradicts the assumption that it is not.

Overall, the explanation uses Cayley's theorem and tables to shed light on how elements form cosets relative to a subgroup, providing insights into group structure and behavior through visual and logical reasoning.
