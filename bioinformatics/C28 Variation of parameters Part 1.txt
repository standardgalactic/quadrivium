Now in this video we want to look at the variation of parameters. Now we've already
looked at it when we looked at first order linear ordinary differential equations.
But now we want to step it up to second order and we're going to use exactly the same
methods although of course we're going to expand on them and it becomes a bit more
more complex. And what we're trying to build on is we've already done higher order and linear
ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. But now we have
we have these variables or functions of x as these variables for y and all its derivatives.
So these are not constants anymore they are functions of x. And just to show you remember
a sub 2 of x should not equal zero. Now many times I'm just going to leave out that it is a function
of x. So a sub 2 there refers to the fact that this is a function of x not a constant.
Now first of all if we do get a function like this it is linear. It is an ordinary differential
equation of second order and we have these functions as variables. Now I'm going to write
it in standard form as we did with the first order equations and I'm going to divide each of these
expressions by a sub 2 of x. So a sub 1 divided by a sub 2 I just warn you again that I've I write this
these are not constants these are functions of x such that it becomes in standard form. So this p of x
is a 1 of x divided by a 2 of x and q is a sub 0 of x divided by a sub 2 of x and g of x divided
by a sub 2 of x we call f of x and that's the standard form. Now we've got to make a few assumptions
and it's very difficult to follow along in textbooks what what they're trying to say so let's let's let's
give it a go. So we've got to make two assumptions we're going to construct two functions and functions
in x called u sub 1 and x and u sub 2 of x such that we're going to construct the particular solution
remember we're still dealing with the whole family of solutions is going to be a sum of the
complementary and the particular solutions but we construct these two functions we don't know what
they are we've got to calculate them such that if I multiply u sub 1 with y sub 1 and u sub 2 with y
sub 2 I get the particular solution now where do I grab this y sub 1 and y sub 2 from well they come
from the complementary solutions c sub 1 of y1 c sub 2 of y2 now if you just do something that's a bit
easier than this just do a normal uh higher order ordinary differential equation linear
with constant coefficients and you'll note that y sub c remember if we if we um the various methods
that we use the the complementary set or appears in the particular set appears in the particular set
and if we if we use the annihilator approach um we remove those complementary ones but there is a part of
those we there is a part other than the the constant part that does appear in the particular part look
at those and you'll see this is really this is not a stretch these always appear as part of of the final
solution there are going to be these parts of this whole part that appear there okay so we're going to
use this y sub 1 so it's anything there all of these and if it's second order remember they're going to
be two c sub 1 and c sub 2 anything that's not a constant in the complementary we're going to use
and we're going to multiply this by u1 u sub 1 and this by u sub 2 this y2 with u sub 2 so this is not
this is not at a thin air okay now we've got y sub p the particular solution set of solutions a family of
solutions now we're going to differentiate it once and we're going to differentiate it too remember
now that this is a function of s and x and this is a function of x in other words i've got to i hope
you can still see that these are both functions in x so i've got to use the product rule so it's going to
be u sub 1 prime times y sub 1 plus u sub 1 y sub 1 prime and the same for that and and use the product
tool for each of those these are each functions in x if i get the second derivative and this is what
i will get now what i can do is um i can just neaten things up well not neaten things up i've got
now y double prime i've got y prime and i've got y and i'm now going to substitute it in there in my
i'm going to substitute it in here in my standard form i've got that i've got that i've got that i know
what i've got the f of x and i'm just going to put p p of x and q of x in there so if i do that
i've got this whole where we go there's this whole pause the video see i'm i don't know if i'm i might
have made a little mistake there but it's not the point see that you substitute this back in the standard
form and you should get this and all we do now is we just group and simplify so there's u sub 1 and i
could substitute that or this that's taken out as a common factor so let's have a look let's have a
look let's have a look um um you'll find there's a u sub 1 there's a u sub 2 so we're just going to
take them out as uh so this gets multiplied out the p gets p of x gets multiplied out by all of these
and then you take out u sub 1 and u sub 2 as common factors and this is what you left with
but remember i chose y sub 1 and y sub 2 i chose them to be part of this complementary set in other
words if i substituted them back in there f of x f of x has got to be zero it's got to be the
homogeneous equation because i grabbed y sub 1 and y sub 2 from this complementary set of solutions by
making f of x equals zero so in actual fact this part here equals zero and that part there equals zero
because we changed this and there it is exactly i've just chosen sub 1 sub 1 sub 1 and sub 2 sub 2 sub 2
but i chose them such that they are from the complementary set so let's just watch watch the time so these are
from the complementary set where f of x equals zero in other words in other words those two are zero and they
disappear so this is going to disappear this first one this second one is going to disappear if we look
at these next four those two and those two can be rewritten as the derivatives because if i take the
derivative of that if i take the derivative of that i'm going to have these first two and if i take the
derivative of that i'm going to be left with those two pause the video and do it and see you'll get the
same thing so i can get that right that is a derivative and that is a derivative which is what we've done
there and now i'm just combining and summing the two so that's the sum of two derivatives that equals the
derivative of the sum of those two and that and that now if we look at this equation where we sit
now we have two unknowns so we need two equations so what can we do about it this whole long thing
it's just one long equation so all of these are just long equations they just go off the page and
they'll get too small if i if i print them out like that so they are like this now out of all of this we
actually need two equations because this u sub one prime and u sub two prime it appears all over
the show actually as to the two unknowns now what i can do is i can let this u sub one prime y1 and u sub
two prime times y sub two i can let that equal zero i'm just doing that no explanation for why i do
that let's just do that which means i land up with two equations this one equals zero
and that one equals zero now we're going to move on to a bit of matrix algebra i want to stop the video
here and and i want to break it up in two and i'll continue in the next video as to what we do
i've let this equal equal to zero um and it's it's also not out of thin air in as much as
if we look at what we had originally and how we chose y sub one and y sub two
and how we constructed u sub one and u sub two and if i take the derivative of that times that and
the derivative of that times that i am going to get zero i don't want to get bogged down in that
except for now that we let this equal zero in other words those two these two here equal zero and
uh uh these two look these are exactly the same u prime sub one u prime sub one y sub one y sub one
so that the derivative if this is zero the derivative of that is zero and that's also zero
that leaves me with this part if that is zero then this must equal the f of x then this part
with the primes has got to equal the f of x so that is zero so that means this part has got to be the
f of x and now i have two functions and two unknowns i'm going to stop the video and we'll carry on in the
next one
