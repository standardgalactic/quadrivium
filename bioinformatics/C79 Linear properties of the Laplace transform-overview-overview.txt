The text explains the linearity property of the Laplace transform, which states that if you have a combination of functions multiplied by constants, such as \( a \cdot f(t) + b \cdot g(t) \), their Laplace transforms can be expressed as:

\[ a \cdot \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} + b \cdot \mathcal{L}\{g(t)\} \]

This means you can take the constants outside of the transform and compute each term separately. For example, to find the Laplace transform of \( 1 + 4t \):

- The Laplace transform of 1 is \( \frac{1}{s} \).
- The Laplace transform of \( t \) is \( \frac{1}{s^2} \).

By applying linearity, the Laplace transform of \( 1 + 4t \) becomes:

\[ \frac{1}{s} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{s^2} = \frac{1}{s} + \frac{4}{s^2} \]

This example demonstrates how to use linearity and manage constants in the context of Laplace transforms.
