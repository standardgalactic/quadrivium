The lesson on "Types" in Julia introduces how variables and their data types are structured within the language, starting with setting up a new Julia notebook. Key points covered include:

1. **Variable Types**: Similar to numerical values having types (like integers or rational numbers), Julia assigns specific types to variable contents.

2. **Dynamic Type System**: Unlike static typing in some languages, where data types must be declared explicitly (e.g., `integer x = 3;`), Julia does not require such declarations upon variable creation. This allows for more flexible and faster coding but may use more memory.

3. **Objects and Memory**: In Julia, variables store objects, and specifying data types can improve performance by optimizing memory allocation and execution speed.

4. **Hierarchical Structure of Types**: The lesson notes that Julia's types are organized hierarchically, a topic to be explored further in later lessons.

Overall, the session provides an introduction to how types function in Julia, paving the way for deeper exploration of type hierarchies and memory management in future tutorials.
