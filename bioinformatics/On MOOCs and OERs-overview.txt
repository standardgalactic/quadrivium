The text explores whether Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) will replace traditional education. It suggests that debates about this topic often rest on flawed assumptionsâ€”that either MOOCs or traditional methods can succeed, but not both together. The author argues that students learn in diverse ways and may struggle with a one-size-fits-all approach from a single lecturer. Instead, the inclusion of multiple teaching voices through Open Educational Resources (OER) and MOOCs enriches education by catering to varied learning needs and making knowledge more accessible. Therefore, rather than replacing traditional methods, MOOCs enhance the educational landscape.

The text discusses whether Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) will replace traditional education. It highlights the flawed nature of debates that assume MOOCs and traditional education are mutually exclusive, arguing that this binary perspective is incorrect. The author suggests that students learn in diverse ways and that a single teaching approach may not cater to all learning styles, leading some students to miss out on essential knowledge.

The text advocates for incorporating more voices and methods into education, suggesting that MOOCs and Open Educational Resources (OER) enhance educational opportunities by providing varied perspectives. This enrichment makes it impossible to ignore the value of integrating these resources with traditional education to better serve diverse student needs.
