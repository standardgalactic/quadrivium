To find points along the x-axis where the electric potential \( V \) is zero due to two point charges, we consider the following setup and calculations:

### Problem Setup

You have:
- Charge 1 (\( q_1 = +5e \)) at position \( x = 0 \).
- Charge 2 (\( q_2 = -15e \)) at position \( x = 0.24 \) meters.

The goal is to find where the total electric potential along the x-axis equals zero, assuming \( V_\infty = 0 \).

### Electric Potential Formula

For two charges, the total electric potential \( V \) at a point on the x-axis is:

\[
V = V_1 + V_2 = \frac{kq_1}{r_1} + \frac{kq_2}{r_2}
\]

To find where \( V = 0 \):

\[
\frac{q_1}{r_1} = -\frac{q_2}{r_2}
\]

### Solving for Points Where \( V = 0 \)

#### 1. Negative x-axis (left of \( q_1 \))

For a point at position \( x = -d \) (\( d > 0 \)):
- Distance to \( q_1 \): \( r_1 = d \)
- Distance to \( q_2 \): \( r_2 = 0.24 + d \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{d} = \frac{15e}{0.24 + d}
\]

Solving for \( d \):

\[
5(0.24 + d) = 15d
\]
\[
1.2 + 5d = 15d
\]
\[
1.2 = 10d
\]
\[
d = 0.12 \, \text{meters}
\]

The point on the negative x-axis where \( V = 0 \) is at \( x = -0.12 \) meters.

#### 2. Positive x-axis (right of both charges)

For a point at position \( x = 0.24 + d \):
- Distance to \( q_1 \): \( r_1 = 0.24 + d \)
- Distance to \( q_2 \): \( r_2 = d \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{0.24 + d} = \frac{15e}{d}
\]

Solving for \( d \):

\[
5d = 15(0.24 + d)
\]
\[
5d = 3.6 + 15d
\]
\[
-10d = 3.6
\]
\[
d = -0.36 \, \text{meters}
\]

Since \( d \) is negative, there's no point on the positive x-axis beyond both charges where \( V = 0 \).

#### 3. Between the Charges

For a point between the charges at position \( x = b \), where \( 0 < b < 0.24 \):
- Distance to \( q_1 \): \( r_1 = b \)
- Distance to \( q_2 \): \( r_2 = 0.24 - b \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{b} = \frac{15e}{0.24 - b}
\]

Solving for \( b \):

\[
5(0.24 - b) = 15b
\]
\[
1.2 - 5b = 15b
\]
\[
1.2 = 20b
\]
\[
b = 0.06 \, \text{meters}
\]

The point between the charges where \( V = 0 \) is at \( x = 0.06 \) meters.

### Conclusion

There are two points along the x-axis where the electric potential is zero:
- On the negative x-axis: \( x = -0.12 \) meters.
- Between the charges: \( x = 0.06 \) meters.

The text presents an equation that involves finding the point along the x-axis where the electric potential \( V \) is zero between two charges separated by 0.24 meters. The equation given is:

\[
\frac{5e}{b} = \frac{15e}{0.24 - b}
\]

This equation can be solved for \( b \), representing the distance from one of the charges to the point where \( V = 0 \). Through algebraic manipulation, it is determined that:

1. Multiply both sides by \( b(0.24 - b) \) to clear the fractions:
   \[
   5e(0.24 - b) = 15eb
   \]

2. Simplify and solve for \( b \):
   \[
   1.2 - 5b = 15b
   \]
   \[
   1.2 = 20b
   \]
   \[
   b = 0.06 \, \text{meters}
   \]

Thus, the point where \( V = 0 \) between the charges is at \( x = 0.06 \) meters from one of the charges.

The summary highlights that there are two points along the x-axis where the electric potential is zero:
- \( x = -0.12 \) meters (to the left of both charges)
- \( x = 0.06 \) meters (between the charges)

There is no point to the right of both charges where the potential is zero. The text emphasizes a methodical algebraic approach to solve this type of problem and suggests that it can be an engaging challenge for those interested in such mathematical exercises involving electric charges.
