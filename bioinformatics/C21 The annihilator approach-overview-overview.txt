The text introduces an alternative method for solving non-homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with constant coefficients using what is known as the annihilator approach. This technique simplifies the process of finding particular solutions to these ODEs by developing a differential operator that nullifies or "annihilates" the non-homogeneous part, represented by an external function \( g(x) \).

### Key Concepts:

1. **Context**: 
   - The focus is on higher-order linear ODEs with non-homogeneous components.

2. **Differential Operators**:
   - Differential equations can be expressed using notations like derivatives (\( \frac{dy}{dx} \)) and the operator \( D \).
   - An nth order differential operator, denoted as \( L \), acts on functions to produce other functions.

3. **Annihilating Operator**:
   - The goal is to find an operator that eliminates the non-homogeneous part \( g(x) \). For instance, for a linear function like \( y = x \), its second derivative \( d^2y/dx^2 = 0 \), so \( d^2 \) serves as the annihilating operator.
   - The degree of this operator is typically one more than the highest power in a polynomial \( g(x) \).

4. **Examples**:
   - For polynomials such as \( x^n \), the required differential operator is \( d^{n+1} \).
   - For exponential functions like \( e^{\alpha x} \), the appropriate operator is \( (d - \alpha)^{n+1} \).

5. **Future Exploration**:
   - The text suggests further exploration of examples using these operators to demonstrate their application.

Overall, this method provides a streamlined way to tackle non-homogeneous ODEs by concentrating on removing the non-homogeneous term through differentiation.
