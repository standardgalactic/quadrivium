The text explores the evolution of glucose management in the perioperative setting, particularly focusing on insulin administration for patients. Initially, increased blood glucose levels after surgery were considered normal, but uncontrolled glucose can lead to higher morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.

Early research supported very strict glucose control, aiming for levels below 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), which was associated with better outcomes. However, later randomized trials indicated that such tight control increased the risk of hypoglycemia, leading to greater morbidity and mortality.

The issue arose because initial studies were conducted in intensive care units with specialized staff who could effectively manage these strict protocols, unlike typical clinical settings where resources are limited. As a result, attempting very tight glucose control outside of ICU environments resulted in higher rates of hypoglycemia and adverse outcomes.

Current guidelines recommend keeping perioperative blood glucose below 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). This approach balances the benefits of intervention with the risks associated with overly stringent glucose management, improving overall patient outcomes compared to no treatment or excessively tight control.
