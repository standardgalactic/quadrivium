The text provides an explanation of how to perform matrix multiplication. Unlike scalar multiplication, where each element in a matrix is multiplied by a single number, matrix multiplication follows specific rules:

1. **Rule for Multiplication**: Two matrices can be multiplied only if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix. If this condition isn't met, the multiplication cannot be performed.

2. **Size of Resultant Matrix**: When two matrices are eligible to multiply (i.e., they satisfy the rule), the size of the resultant matrix is determined by using the number of rows from the first matrix and the number of columns from the second matrix. The "two twos" used for determining compatibility are ignored.

3. **Multiplication Process**:
   - To find an element in a specific position (e.g., row 1, column 1) of the resultant matrix, select the corresponding row from the first matrix and the corresponding column from the second matrix.
   - Multiply each pair of elements from these selected row and column together.
   - Sum up all the products to get the value for that element in the resultant matrix.

The text then provides a step-by-step example using two matrices, A (a 2x2 matrix) and B (a 2x4 matrix), showing how to multiply them and determine each element of the resulting 2x4 matrix. For instance:
- The first element is found by multiplying elements from the first row of A with those in the first column of B: \( (2 \times 1) + (3 \times 4) = 14 \).
- This process continues for other elements, as outlined in the text.

The explanation encourages pausing to practice finding subsequent elements independently.

Matrix multiplication differs from scalar multiplication, as it follows specific rules. Two matrices can be multiplied only if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix. When this condition is met, the resulting matrix's size is determined by the number of rows in the first matrix and the number of columns in the second matrix.

For example, multiplying a 2x2 matrix \( A \) with a 2x4 matrix \( B \) results in a 2x4 matrix. To find each element in the resultant matrix, you take the corresponding row from the first matrix and the column from the second matrix, multiply their elements pairwise, and sum these products.

For instance:
- The element at row 1, column 1 of the resultant matrix is calculated by multiplying elements (2, 3) from row 1 of \( A \) with elements (1, 4) from column 1 of \( B \), resulting in \( 2 \times 1 + 3 \times 4 = 14 \).
- Similarly, other elements are computed using the same process for their respective rows and columns.

The text provides a step-by-step method to perform matrix multiplication, emphasizing understanding the dimensions and applying the described procedure.
