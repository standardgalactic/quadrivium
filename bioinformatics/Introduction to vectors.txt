So today we're going to start discussing vectors and if there is a beautiful such an interesting
and rich subject or topic in mathematics to study it is vectors. Vectors, vector fields,
vector calculus it is absolutely fantastic. Now we're going to start looking at this from the
point of view of of linear algebra and with vectors most of you would have seen vectors
before if we just look at a vector in a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system we have
our x-axis and our y-axis and we just have a point here so this point is oh let's make it
not to scale but two comma one we've all we have that notion of a point and if i draw this down
this will be two on the x-axis there'd be one and this will be one there on the y-axis we have this
notion of this point but we can turn this point into a vector and the vector goes from our origin
here and that is where it has its tail and that's where it has its head and we put a little arrow
to indicate because a vector contains two bits of information the first bit of information is just
how long it is and the second one is its direction so how long it is how long it is that is its magnitude
magnitude magnitude magnitude magnitude and then it has a direction and we can just use some reference
point usually in this coordinate system it will be the x-axis and it is this angle theta or whatever
greek symbol you want to put in there the angle that this makes with the x-axis and that is a vector
vector and we will use this notation of this vector as two comma one so there's this point notation but
this vector let's call this this vector vector v and this vector v we can write as two and one so that is
actually a little matrix with a single column so this is a two by one matrix two by one two rows one column
that is the vector representation column vector form of this vector and that just ties these two things
together so beautifully this abstract idea of this column vector well it's actually a small matrix if
you want to think about it in small and as much as it only has has one column and this represents you
know this this arrow with its with its origin there the tail and the head there and this pointy thing
it has a direction and it has a magnitude you know that together with just this point in a cartesian system
now also if we have a third dimension if we were to have a third dimension here this can point in any
direction now it will have a couple of angles because it's not only this angle that it points up but also
the angle that it points out in this x z plane if you want to think about this and we'll draw it
properly this is not drawn properly but you can imagine it pointing there towards you instead of in
in the board it still has a magnitude the magnitude is quite simple though if we just start with this
this will be the y and this will be x and we remember our friend pythagoras and usually we write this
call it the norm of a vector and we write it like this and that's just going to be the pythagorean
theorem so this is going to be the square root of x squared plus y squared and we notice no matter
what direction it points in it's always going to have a a positive magnitude we're just going to take
the positive of the square root that is a positive that's a positive so even if it points down in a
negative negative direction we're still going to get this magnitude you can also think that at least
here it becomes very easy because the the tangent of theta is just y over x so it's very easy to to
look at theta there as just being this arc tangent this arc tangent of y over x so that's very simple
and it just scales up from there if our vector was in three in three dimensions it would just be there
and you can you can just think that if we were to to name this x sub one and this is x sub two and this
is x sub three instead of x y and z you know we could have this vector of x sub one squared x sub two
squared x sub three squared x sub four squared it just carries on in multi-dimension no matter how many
dimensions we have and we'll have more numbers down here say that's one four so that is going to be a
four-dimensional vector and that's a beautiful thing i mean in so many dimensions the norm of
this vector is still very easy or so easy concept to understand just one thing i want to show you as
well if i have a vector that's up there and it is has the same direction and it has the same magnitude
we consider these two vectors as exactly the same thing so don't have it stuck in your head
that there's somehow something different because of this vector because it's already it's it's tail
at least it's not at the origin because i can take it lift it off bring it down and put it exactly on
top of that thing so those two things is exactly it's exactly the same thing we don't don't consider
it moving around somewhere wherever it is just bring its tail back to the origin those are exactly the
same thing and that allows us something very easy and that is the addition of vectors and the
subtraction of vectors from each other and that is something that we'll get into so it's a very
natural thing this thinking of vectors is actually quite an easy thing to think about it's such a
you can visualize it we're going to do this this abstract mathematics on on these vectors and then
we're going to multiply vectors different types of things that we can do with these vectors binary
operations on these vectors and they become such a beautiful rich playground and i want you to really
be excited about vectors and this this idea of these column vectors we're going to look at the row
vectors as well certainly many interesting topics to come i absolutely love vectors and i want you to
love vectors as well and they because they they just such something that you can just conjure up in
your mind it's such a visual thing and such a beautiful thing and powerful thing i mean think about where
vectors are used vector fields it's just it's just everywhere it's such a rich topic at least in
mathematics and linear algebra so i really want us to to to enjoy vectors so here we are in mathematical
let's have a look let's start having a look at a vector now we've seen on the board that we can draw
a column vector it is just a sort of a single column so let's see how we would go about that
and there we have it i've created a list inside of that is a sub list and
so two i'm making two rows the first row will have one in it the second row two and i printed
out the matrix form it's a column vector so that would be one way to look at a column vector before
we get to vectors vector addition vector subtraction vector multiplication let's just go back and look
at it graphically so there's a very nice function inside of mathematica the wolfram language called graphics
so let's have the graphics and what i'm going to do with these graphics is i'm going to do two arrows
and so with it being two they go inside of curly braces remember so my arrow number one it's just arrow
and i tell it what the coordinates are that is the coordinates of the tail and then the coordinates of
the head so that has to go inside of curly braces so first all the list zero comma zero so that's my tail
that's the points on a cartesian plane for the tail let's go for the head and let's make that at one comma
one so there we go and i'm going to close my curly braces again because that's a list of two elements
and each of these sub elements has two elements inside of them so that's the first arrow that i
want to draw comma let's do a second one just to get used to this so an arrow open my square brackets
open and two curly braces zero comma zero for the origin once again and let's go to let's go to three
comma zero so that's the x and the y coordinate close so it's a double closure there of my curly
braces close my arrow the the arguments so the square bracket that i have there but then i just
must remember that this was inside of the graphics function this was a list of two arrows so i've got
to close those curly braces as well and close the square bracket so look at that curly brace curly brace
square brace curly brace square brace so it can become a bit technical here but you've got to
just remember where they all fit together so on the outside i have this graphics function
it takes an argument which is a list so that has to go inside of its own set of curly braces
two arguments that i pass in both of them are arrow functions and you see how i construct those
and there we have it i have my two vectors you can clearly see the vector going from
zero zero up to one one and the other one going along the x-axis to x equals three and y equals zero
so very nice just to draw your vectors easy easy enough at least here in two dimensions now remember
i set the angle between vectors now that's very nice to do in mathematical i'm going to say vector
angle it's a simple vector angle and it's always going to do this with regard to the two with regard to the
to the origin so that's zero zero and then all i have to do is put in the two heads or the coordinate
point of the two heads so i don't have to worry about the zero zero which is the the origin which is
where the tail of these vectors are so let's make the one at let's make the one at one comma one
so it goes from zero zero to one comma one i only have to put the one comma one and the other one
let's make it go then also to three comma zero three comma zero close that close so it's exactly this
vector that i drew up here and you know what this angle between them is going to be because this goes
from zero zero to one one and there we go we see it's pi over four so 45 degrees so pi over four
radians so you can very easily work out the angle between between two vectors now what if we move this
over and we move it to the one vector being in the second quadrant if we think about the
coordinate system the the cartesian coordinate system so what i'm going to do from my second
monitor here is just copy and paste let's have a look at what we have here we have graphics again
a list of two arguments both of them are the arrow function exactly as we did before
but we have this one vector going to negative one on the x-axis let's have a let's have a look at that
and there we go now we see the second vector pointing in the second quadrant
so very easy to do let's see what mathematica thinks the angle between these when between
these two are so once again we just have to do vector angle vector angle there we go and i just
have to do as i said before just where the heads of these are so it's negative one comma one and the
instance and the other one is three comma zero and let's just put a comma there comma and let's have a
look and we see it's three quarters pi it's three quarters pi what about it what would happen if
one of the vectors ends up being in the third quadrant i'm going to just copy and paste it there
you see what the code is like we do that and let's do the vector angle the angle between these two
vector angle and let's just put in the two coordinates it's negative one comma negative one
for the head of the one and the second one we still remain three comma zero so that it still goes along
the x-axis for us and let's have a look at that it is three quarters pi again because once we get over
pi radians so 180 degrees the angle will be measured in this direction so instead of going beyond
pi radians it will do the angle that is smaller here so we again get three quarters pi as far as
that's concerned and if we if we bring it into the fourth quadrant it's going to be pi over four i just
want to show you that we can do this in three dimensions as well of course we can't go to the fourth
dimension but have a look at this i'm going to do graphics 3d i'm going to then draw a thick
so my first argument is going to be thick and then arrow at zero zero zero as far as my
origins concerned one comma zero comma zero as far as the as far as the head is concerned and for the
second one zero zero zero zero to one one one let's have a look at this and you see we've got a
little cube here which is fantastic that's the graphics 3d creating that 3d representation for us
and because i've said past thick as one of my arguments so i have three arguments inside of this
list which i passed to graphics 3d it'll draw these two as thick as these thicker lines so you can clearly
see the angle that this one goes at an angle away from this plane this cartesian plane if we can
think about this front of the cube is a cartesian plane and i can really roll it around very nicely
so depending on what angle we view it at we can clearly see what's happening in the three-dimensional
space and what will happen as well is that we can get an angle between these so if i were to say vector
angle and i'm just going to pass in as far as my arguments are concerned these two lists so remember
one had a headed one comma zero comma zero and the other one was at one comma one comma one and i'm
going to close that and all i want is for it just to be expressed in numerical as far as in the format at
least of a numerical approximation and we see the 0.955317 so that'd be the angle between those between
those two vectors so very impressive then indeed play around and create some of your own vectors to start
off with
Thank you.
