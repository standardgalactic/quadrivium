The text outlines the process of solving an initial value problem for a differential equation with the first derivative given by \(\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}\). The goal is to find an exact solution using specified initial conditions.

1. **Separation of Variables**: Begin by separating variables, resulting in \( y \, dy = -x \, dx \).

2. **Integration**: Integrate both sides to obtain:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}y^2 = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + c
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   y^2 = -x^2 + 2c
   \]

3. **Rewriting**: Let \( 2c = C \) to rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   y^2 = C - x^2
   \]

4. **Circle Equation**: Recognize this form as a circle's equation, leading to:
   \[
   y = \pm \sqrt{C - x^2}
   \]

5. **Applying Initial Condition**: Use the initial condition \( (0.4, -3) \) to find \( C \):
   \[
   -3 = \sqrt{C - 0.4^2}
   \]
   Solving gives:
   \[
   C = 25
   \]

6. **Selecting Solution**: The equation becomes:
   \[
   y = \pm \sqrt{25 - x^2}
   \]
   Choose the negative branch due to the initial condition's negative \( y \)-value:
   \[
   y = -\sqrt{25 - x^2}
   \]

7. **Final Solution**: The specific solution that satisfies the initial value \( (0.4, -3) \) is:
   \[
   y = -\sqrt{25 - x^2}
   \] 

This ensures the solution meets the given initial condition.
