In this lecture on complex numbers, addition, subtraction, and multiplication are discussed. Complex numbers are defined as \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part with \( i \) being the imaginary unit.

**Addition:**
To add two complex numbers \( z_1 = a_1 + b_1i \) and \( z_2 = a_2 + b_2i \), simply add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately:
\[ z_1 + z_2 = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2)i. \]

**Subtraction:**
For subtraction, \( z_1 - z_2 = (a_1 + b_1i) - (a_2 + b_2i) \), distribute the negative sign and then combine real and imaginary parts:
\[ z_1 - z_2 = (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)i. \]

**Multiplication:**
To multiply two complex numbers \( z_1 \times z_2 = (a_1 + b_1i)(a_2 + b_2i) \), use the FOIL method:
\[ z_1 \times z_2 = a_1a_2 + a_1b_2i + a_2b_1i + b_1b_2i^2. \]
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this simplifies to:
\[ z_1 \times z_2 = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)i. \]

The lecture emphasizes the straightforward nature of operations with complex numbers, akin to arithmetic with binomials in algebra.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of how to multiply complex numbers. It begins with the expression \((b_1 + b_2i)\) and breaks down the multiplication process using distributive property:

1. **Initial Multiplication**: Start by expanding \((a_1 + b_1i)(a_2 + b_2i)\). Multiply each term:
   - \(a_1 \times a_2\)
   - \(a_1 \times b_2i\)
   - \(b_1i \times a_2\)
   - \(b_1i \times b_2i\) which becomes \(-b_1b_2\) because \(i^2 = -1\).

2. **Combine Like Terms**: 
   - The real part is \(a_1a_2 - b_1b_2\).
   - The imaginary part is \(a_1b_2 + a_2b_1\), resulting in the expression \((a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)i\).

3. **Example**: Multiply specific complex numbers:
   - \(z_1 = 3 + 4i\) and \(z_2 = 2 + 2i\).
   - Calculate: 
     - Real part: \(3 \times 2 - 4 \times 2 = 6 - 8 = -2\).
     - Imaginary part: \(3 \times 2 + 4 \times 2 = 6 + 8 = 14i\).

The result is \(-2 + 14i\). The text emphasizes using familiar multiplication rules and remembering that \(i^2 = -1\) to handle complex numbers. It encourages practicing addition, subtraction, and multiplication of complex numbers to reinforce understanding.
