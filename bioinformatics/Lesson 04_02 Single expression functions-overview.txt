The text introduces two forms of syntax in Julia for creating functions: single-expression functions and multiple-expression functions.

1. **Single-Expression Functions**: 
   - These use a mathematical format similar to `f(x, y)`, where `f` is the function name and `(x, y)` are arguments.
   - Example given: A function named `f` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns `x^2 - 3*y`. When called with `f(2, 1)`, it calculates `4 - 3 = 1`.
   - Another example is a function `g(x)` that returns `x^2`. Calling `g(3)` yields `9`.
   - This form of function definition is concise: name the function, list arguments in parentheses, and use an equal sign followed by the expression to compute.

2. **Multiple-Expression Functions**:
   - These are hinted at as more complex than single-expression functions but aren't detailed in the text.
   - They allow for more extensive logic or multiple operations within a function body.

The text also mentions that Julia's handling of functions involves "multiple dispatch," a concept to be explored later. This feature allows different method implementations based on argument types, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in function usage.

The text introduces two forms of syntax in Julia for creating functions: single expression functions and the hint towards multiple expression functions.

1. **Single Expression Functions**: These are concise functions defined using a mathematical format. A function named `f` is used as an example, which takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns the result of \( x^2 - 3y \). This syntax involves naming the function (in this case, `f`) and listing its parameters in parentheses. An expression following the equal sign determines what the function computes. When `f(2, 1)` is executed, it correctly calculates \( 2^2 - 3 \times 1 = 4 - 3 = 1 \).

   Another example given is a function named `g`, which takes one argument `x` and returns \( x^2 \). Calling `g(3)` yields \( 3^2 = 9 \). This syntax emphasizes simplicity, where the function name, arguments in parentheses, and an expression after the equal sign define its behavior.

2. **Multiple Expression Functions**: While not detailed in the text, it is mentioned that there are multiple expression functions for more complex tasks, suggesting a progression from single to more elaborate function definitions.

The explanation highlights Julia's flexible approach to defining functions, starting with simple one-line expressions and hinting at the capability to handle more complex logic.
