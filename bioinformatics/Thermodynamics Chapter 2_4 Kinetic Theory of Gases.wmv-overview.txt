The text provides an explanation of molar specific heats for ideal gases, focusing initially on monatomic gases like argon and neon. It outlines the relationship between heat (\(Q\)), number of moles (\(N\)), specific heat capacity (\(C\)), and change in temperature (\(\Delta T\)). The discussion begins with the formula \(Q = NC \cdot \Delta T\) and delves into how this relates to internal energy, which is derived from the average translational kinetic energy of gas particles.

For an ideal monatomic gas, the total average kinetic energy is shown to be dependent only on temperature and can be expressed as \( \frac{3}{2} NRT \). This leads to the conclusion that the internal energy (\(E_{\text{internal}}\)) of such a gas depends solely on its temperature.

The text then transitions into discussing molar specific heat capacities at constant volume (\(C_V\)). By applying the first law of thermodynamics and noting that work done is zero at constant volume, it derives \(C_V = \frac{3}{2} R\) for monatomic gases. This value changes with the atomicity of the gas: diatomic gases have a molar specific heat at constant volume of \(\frac{5}{2} R\), and polyatomic gases like methane have a value of \(3R\).

In summary, the text explains how the internal energy and molar specific heats for ideal gases are calculated based on their atomic structure and temperature dependence.

The text appears to be disjointed and lacks coherent structure, making it difficult to provide a meaningful summary. It seems to contain fragments of phrases or words that might suggest uncertainty or negation ("No," "Nothing is something to do"), possibly in a repetitive or nonsensical manner. The repetition of "You whoa" could imply confusion or emphasis on an unclear subject. Without additional context, it's challenging to derive a clear message from the text.
