The text elaborates on Archimedes' principle by highlighting two important aspects:

1. The magnitude of the buoyant force does not depend on the density of the fluid.
2. When the fluid's density increases, the volume of fluid displaced decreases because the mass of the displaced fluid matches the object's mass.

As a result, denser fluids need to displace less volume to balance an immersed object's mass. These points are essential for comprehending buoyancy and displacement concepts.
