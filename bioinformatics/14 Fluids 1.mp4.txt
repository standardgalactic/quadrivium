In this short video series I want to discuss fluids. Specifically this first video will
be quite short. I'm only going to look at density and pressure. Here we have the equation
for density. We have a point with an area around it which gives us a specific mass and
we divide that by the volume that that mass contains. If there is a uniform density then
we can simply write density as mass divided by volume and we have the units there in SI
units of kilogram per cubic meter. If we look at pressure, our equation for pressure, that
is just the spread of a force applied over an area. And if we take the limiting value
as delta A, the area goes to zero, we'll get a specific point pressure. But if this pressure
is uniform over that area, we can simply use pressure equals force divided by area and that
will give us Newton per square meter. So that's quite simple. There are a few units that one
can try and memorize, although I feel strongly that this should be given to you in the exams
rather than having to know all of these. There is certainly a lot more of them which will
make memorizing them a lot more complicated. But there we have one atmosphere being 1.01 times
10 to the power of 5 pascals. One tor is 1 millimetres of mercury. Despite what the textbooks say,
in medicine we still use the term millimetres of mercury. The density of air there being
1.21 kilograms per cubic meter. The density of water, that's this water at 20 degrees Celsius,
is 998 kilograms per cubic meter. And the density of sea water, obviously with a lot more solute
in the water, that's 1,024 kilograms per square meter.
