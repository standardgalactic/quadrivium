Ok, here's an interesting problem. I want to know
what is the angle between the diagonal of a cube
and any one of its
sides. So, corner sides.
So, imagine this box comes out at you and this goes from
the furthest one down the back to this
front one here. I want to know. So, I can certainly
change all of these into vectors. And if I change them
into vectors, if I change them into vectors
if I, let's make this
x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis
and let's make this cube
equal to unit vectors. So, they each are going to have a length of one.
That is a unit vector. I don't know if you've spoken about it. A unit vector has a
magnitude of one. So, this vector
down here
from there to there along the x
just along the x-axis
if I make that into a vector
that is certainly going to have
this is the x-axis
this unit vector here
let's call it i-roof
is going to have
it's going to have
on the x-axis
it has one
it does not move on the y-axis
and it does not move on the z-axis
ok, so it's going to be
1, 0, 0
let's call
this vector
that goes up here
this vector that goes up to there
is this on the z-axis
yeah, z-axis, let's do this
let's do this one first
the vector j-roof
will be 0, 1, 0
and as much as on the x-axis
it doesn't move anything
on the z-axis it doesn't
and certainly it moves this one
on this y-axis
then let's call vector k-roof
0, 0, 1
that makes this vector here
that we're interested in
let's call it vector d
or diagonal
it's going to make it 1, 1, 1
because it goes out
one in each direction
I need to make these ones
I can call this i
and this one j
and this one k
but they're all of equal length
and that's why I want to put ones there
ok, so I just need to know
the angle between two of them
so let's make it the z one
and this d
so right at the back there
the angle between those two
so if I want the angle between two
so I'm going to do vector
I choose vector k
so I'm going to use vector d
dot product vector k
we know that that's going to be
the norm of d
times the norm of k
times the cosine of the angle between them
and I'm definitely interested
in that angle between them
which is going to be the arc cosine of
d dot k
now d dot k
is going to be d1 k1
plus d2 k2
plus d3 k3
and at the bottom for the length of d
the length of d
where are we, where are we, where are we, where are we, d
is going to be the square root of
the square root of 1 squared
plus 1 squared plus 1 squared
plus 1 squared
times the square root of
k squared
which is 0 0 1
which is just the square root of 1
so I'm looking at an angle of
arc cosine of
let's see
d1 k1
0 times 1
that is 0
plus d2
1 k2 0
that's 0
plus
1 times
1 times 1
is 1
I'm left with 1 there
in the numerator
in the denominator
I'm going to get 1 2 3
square root of 3 times 1
is the square root of 3
so I'm left with theta equals the arc cosine
of 1 over square root of 3
which is what you have to do with your calculator
but that is the angle between
the diagonal
and any one of
the sides of the cube
any one of the sides of the cube
in case you were wondering
I just wanted to make sure
show you that this is independent of
taking the length of these as 1
remember it is a cube though
so they all have to be the same
these 3 values all have to be the same
if I turn them into vectors
so let's make them
p
so that will be a p
that will be a p
and that will be a p
so what is going to happen
let's just redo this
the arc cosine of 1 over 3
let's see if we do this
what's that going to make d
it's going to make d
p p p p p p p p
so theta is still going to be
the arc cosine
of
now we're going to have
d1 k1
d1
so it's p times 0
that's still a 0
that's still a 0
and that's going to be p times
where are we
we've made them p p p
and that's going to be p squared
that's going to be p squared
divided by
now the length of d
which is going to be the square root of
3 times p squared
3 times p squared
because p squared
plus p squared
plus p squared
times
the square root of
the length of k
which is going to be 0 squared 0 squared
p squared
p squared
so theta equals the arc
cosine of
this p can come out
this p can come out
of the square root
the square root sine
so that will be p times p as p squared
which will cancel with that p squared
and I'm still left with 1 over the square root of 3
so independent of what you choose
it doesn't have to be 1
they just all have to be the same
in as much as this is a cube
and the sides of a cube are equally
some quick arithmetic
and some facts that you should remember
if I have two vectors
now I have vector u here
here and vector v there
the angle between them is always defined
so that
0
theta
is pi
so it always lies between pi
so if I have u there
and I have
v there
certainly that is going to be
my angle theta because it's still
smaller than 180 degrees
but as if I have this situation
for u
and v
then this becomes the angle between
that becomes the angle between
we always choose the angle that is
equal to or less than 180 degrees
or more than zero
so we don't deal with negative angles
and we don't deal with angles larger than 180 degrees
if we just then look at what
u dot u is
oh I remember that it's going to be
u squared
at the normal u
times the normal u
times the cosine of the angle between them
what's the angle between them?
it's absolutely nothing
one times itself
one vector dot structure itself
cosine of zero is just the one
so u dot u
u dot u
equals
this
square of the norm
of that vector
square of the norm of that vector
and this is what you should remember
um
theta is
if
um
well let's say
theta equals acute
so that means
that it's going to be less than 90 degrees
less than
pi over 2
if and only if
if and only if
u dot v
is more than
um
if u dot
dot u is larger than
oh I forgot myself
it's larger than zero
sorry about this
and
and
it is obtuse
in other words it's going to lie between
larger than 90 degrees
up to 180 degrees
if and only if
if and only if
u dot v
is less than zero
and it is a right
it is a right angle
they make a right angle
if and only if
u dot v
equals zero
so if you see this answer
you know that angle is obtuse
if you see this answer you know it's
acutely zero
because the cosine of 90 degrees
is zero
that will leave the dot product of these two
to be zero
is of
poor memory as myself
please remember these
