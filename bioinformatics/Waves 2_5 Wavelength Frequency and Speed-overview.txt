To understand how physical properties of a medium determine the velocity of a wave, let's delve into the key concepts presented in your description.

### Wave Velocity on a String

When dealing with waves on a string (or any similar medium), two main factors influence the wave speed: tension (\( \tau \)) and linear density (\( \mu \)). The relationship between these quantities can be expressed as:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{\tau}{\mu}} \]

Where:
- \( v \) is the wave velocity.
- \( \tau \) (tension) is measured in newtons (N), which equates to kg·m/s².
- \( \mu \) (linear density) is the mass per unit length of the string, measured in kg/m.

### Explanation

1. **Tension (\( \tau \))**: This force stretches the string and affects how quickly a disturbance can propagate along it. Greater tension results in faster wave propagation because the string is more tightly stretched, allowing disturbances to travel with less resistance.

2. **Linear Density (\( \mu \))**: This represents the mass per unit length of the string. A higher linear density means that each segment of the string has more mass, which resists acceleration and slows down the wave speed.

### Derivation

The derivation involves understanding how tension affects the centripetal force required for a circular motion of an infinitesimal segment of the string:

- The centripetal force needed to keep a small piece of the string moving in a circle (as it oscillates) is provided by the tension.
- Using Newton's second law \( F = ma \), where acceleration \( a \) for centripetal motion is \( v^2/r \).
  
By setting the tension force equal to the required centripetal force:

\[ \tau \frac{\Delta L}{R} = m \frac{v^2}{R} \]

And substituting mass \( m \) as \( \mu \Delta L \):

\[ \tau \Delta L / R = (\mu \Delta L) v^2 / R \]

The \( \Delta L \) and \( R \) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[ \tau / \mu = v^2 \]

Taking the square root gives the wave speed:

\[ v = \sqrt{\tau/\mu} \]

### Conclusion

This relationship shows that for a given medium (string), the wave speed is constant for any frequency you choose. It depends only on how tightly the string is stretched and its mass per unit length, not on the frequency or wavelength of the waves themselves. This highlights an important property of mechanical waves: their velocity in a given medium remains constant regardless of other characteristics like amplitude or frequency.

The text discusses the relationship between speed, frequency, wavelength, and the properties of the medium through which waves travel. It explains that while understanding the derivation of related equations isn't necessary for basic use, having a deeper comprehension can be beneficial for advancing in physics. The equations involve parameters like tension divided by linear density (represented as \(\tau/\mu\)), where \(\mu\) is not typically given directly but can be calculated from the rope's weight and length.

The author emphasizes that while memorizing these equations is sufficient for exams, appreciating their derivation provides insight into the thought processes of physicists and enhances understanding. For those pressed by time before exams, focusing on memorization and application in problems is recommended; however, for a fuller grasp of physics, exploring how these formulas are derived can be both interesting and important.
