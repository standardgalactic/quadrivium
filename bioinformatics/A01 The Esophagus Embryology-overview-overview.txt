This chapter provides an overview of the esophagus, focusing on its embryological development, anatomical structure, physiological functions, clinical aspects, and related issues. During embryogenesis, the embryo forms three primary layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. The esophagus originates from the foregut segment of the primitive gut tube, which extends from the pharyngeal region to the liver bud.

The endodermal layer develops into the epithelial lining of the esophagus, transitioning to squamous cells near the stomach. The mesodermal layer contributes to both the muscular and serosal components; specifically, the upper two-thirds of the esophagus contains striated muscle controlled by the vagus nerve, while the lower third comprises smooth muscle regulated by the splanchnic nerve.

Further details on the anatomy of the esophagus will be covered in subsequent chapters or videos.
