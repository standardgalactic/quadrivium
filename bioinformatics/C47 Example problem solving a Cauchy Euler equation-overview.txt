The text discusses solving a non-homogeneous linear differential equation involving the second derivative of \( x^2 \), the first derivative \( x_1 \), and no derivative term \( x_0 \). The proposed solution form is \( y = x^m \), where \( y' = m \cdot x^{m-1} \) and \( y'' = (m^2 - m) \cdot x^{m-2} \).

Upon substitution, an error in the initial setup was identifiedâ€”specifically, a missing factor of \( x \). The corrected equation is simplified to \( 3m^2 + 3m + 1 = 0 \), which yields complex roots for \( m \): \( m = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}i \).

The solution form, derived from these roots, is expressed as:

\[ y = x^{-\frac{1}{2}} (c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \ln x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \ln x)) \]

The text reflects on how focusing narrowly during problem-solving can lead to overlooking mistakes and emphasizes the importance of being vigilant, even in non-exam situations.

The text describes the process of solving a non-homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The author is working through an example involving second derivatives and first derivatives but makes a mistake in their initial setup by missing an extra factor of \( x \). After correcting this error, they simplify the equation to find that the characteristic equation yields complex roots, resulting in solutions expressed using Euler's formula.

The solution involves identifying roots \( m = -\frac{1}{2} \pm i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \), which leads to a general solution for the differential equation of the form:
\[ y(x) = x^{-1/2}(c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \ln x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \ln x)). \]

The author reflects on how focusing too narrowly on specific solution methods can lead to oversight, especially when not in an examination setting or real-life application scenario.
