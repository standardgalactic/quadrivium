The text outlines two methods for calculating the total magnification of a compound microscope: the Direct Method and the Step-by-Step Method.

1. **Direct Method**:
   - Utilizes the formula \( M = \left( \frac{25}{f_{\text{objective}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{f_{\text{eyepiece}}}{25} \right) \), where \( f_{\text{objective}} \) and \( f_{\text{eyepiece}} \) are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece lenses, respectively.
   - This straightforward approach yields a total magnification of 209.

2. **Step-by-Step Method**:
   - Involves calculating the magnification for each lens separately.
   - **Objective Lens**: 
     - Determine object distance \( S_0 \) using \( \frac{1}{S_0} = \frac{1}{f_{\text{objective}}} - \frac{1}{S_i} \).
     - Calculate magnification \( M_1 = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} \).
   - **Eyepiece Lens**:
     - Assume a virtual image distance (\( S_i' \)) of -25 cm.
     - Determine object distance for the eyepiece \( S_0' \) using \( \frac{1}{S_0'} = \frac{1}{f_{\text{eyepiece}}} - \frac{1}{S_i'} \).
     - Calculate magnification \( M_2 = -\frac{S_i'}{S_0'} \).
   - Multiply the individual lens magnifications to get the total: \( M_{\text{total}} = M_1 \times M_2 \), resulting in a total magnification of 209.

Both methods provide the same result, with the direct method being simpler for quick calculations and the step-by-step method offering more detailed insights into individual lens contributions.
