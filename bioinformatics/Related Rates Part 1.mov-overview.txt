The video discusses solving a related rates problem involving a cone-shaped water tank. The tank has a radius of 4 meters at the top and stands 10 meters high. Water is added to the tank at a rate of 2 cubic meters per second. The goal is to find the rate at which the height of the water column increases when it reaches 5 meters.

Key steps in solving this problem include:

1. **Understanding Related Rates**: Identify how different rates are related, such as the change in volume over time (\(dV/dt\)) and the change in height over time (\(dH/dt\)).

2. **Volume of a Cone**: Use the formula for the volume of a cone: \(V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\).

3. **Relate Radius to Height**: Since the tank is conical, the radius and height are related by \(R/H = 4/10\) or \(r = \frac{2}{5}h\).

4. **Substitute and Differentiate**: Substitute \(r = \frac{2}{5}H\) into the volume formula to express volume solely in terms of height: \(V = \frac{4\pi}{75}H^3\). Differentiate with respect to height to find \(dV/dH = \frac{12\pi}{75}H^2\).

5. **Set Up and Solve the Equation**: Use the relationship \(dV/dt = dV/dH \cdot dH/dt\) to solve for \(dH/dt\). Given \(dV/dt = 2\), substitute and solve:
   \[
   2 = \frac{12\pi}{75} \times 5^2 \times dH/dt
   \]
   Solving this gives \(dH/dt = \frac{1}{2\pi}\) meters per second when the height is 5 meters.

The solution shows that as the tank fills, the rate of rise in water level decreases due to the increasing cross-sectional area.
