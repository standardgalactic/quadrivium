The text introduces "stabby lambda functions," also known simply as lambda functions, which are anonymous functions characterized by their concise syntax using the minus and greater than sign (e.g., `-x => 2*x**2 + 3*x - 2`). These functions do not have a name, making them suitable for quick, inline operations. The text explains how these stabby functions can be used with Ruby's `map` method to apply a function across elements of an array.

For example, using the map function with a stabby lambda that squares and transforms each element in an array like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, results in applying the expression `2*x**2 + 3*x - 2` to each element. The text also demonstrates an alternative syntax using a block of code with the keyword `do`, achieving the same result.

Further examples illustrate more complex operations within these anonymous functions or blocks, such as conditionals (using `if-else`). In one case, an array `[3, 6, 9, 10, 11]` is processed to multiply each element by a factor based on its remainder when divided by 3: multiplying by 100 if the remainder is 0, by 200 for a remainder of 2, and by 300 for a remainder of 1.

Overall, stabby functions or lambdas are highlighted as efficient tools for processing arrays with mathematical operations in Ruby. The upcoming section promises to explore more advanced uses, like passing functions as arguments.
