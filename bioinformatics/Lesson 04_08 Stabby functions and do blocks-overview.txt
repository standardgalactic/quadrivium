The text introduces "stabby lambda functions," also known simply as lambda functions, which are anonymous functions characterized by their concise syntax using the minus and greater than sign (e.g., `-x => 2*x**2 + 3*x - 2`). These functions do not have a name, making them suitable for quick, inline operations. The text explains how these stabby functions can be used with Ruby's `map` method to apply a function across elements of an array.

For example, using the map function with a stabby lambda that squares and transforms each element in an array like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, results in applying the expression `2*x**2 + 3*x - 2` to each element. The text also demonstrates an alternative syntax using a block of code with the keyword `do`, achieving the same result.

Further examples illustrate more complex operations within these anonymous functions or blocks, such as conditionals (using `if-else`). In one case, an array `[3, 6, 9, 10, 11]` is processed to multiply each element by a factor based on its remainder when divided by 3: multiplying by 100 if the remainder is 0, by 200 for a remainder of 2, and by 300 for a remainder of 1.

Overall, stabby functions or lambdas are highlighted as efficient tools for processing arrays with mathematical operations in Ruby. The upcoming section promises to explore more advanced uses, like passing functions as arguments.

The text discusses "stabby lambda functions," also known simply as lambda functions or stabby syntax, which are anonymous (nameless) functions used for quick operations. These functions utilize the `->` notation, where an expression follows this symbol; for example, `(x) -> 2x^2 + 3x - 2`. They are often employed with Ruby's `map` function to iterate over arrays and apply the lambda function to each element.

An example is provided: a lambda function takes an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, calculates `2x^2 + 3x - 2` for each element (`x`), and returns the results. The text demonstrates how this can be written using both the stabby syntax and within a `do...end` block.

Furthermore, it explains extending functionality by embedding conditionals within `do...end` blocks inside a `map`. For instance, when mapping `[3, 6, 9, 10, 11]`, conditions are set to multiply each element by different factors depending on the remainder of dividing the element by 3: 
- Multiply by 100 if the remainder is 0.
- Multiply by 200 if the remainder is 2.
- Multiply by 300 if the remainder is 3.

This illustrates how stabby functions can be combined with logic blocks for versatile array transformations. The text concludes by mentioning a future discussion on using functions as arguments.
