The text discusses how to determine the electric potential at a point P due to an electric dipole. An electric dipole consists of two opposite charges, with a vector from negative to positive called the dipole moment. The key focus is on calculating the electric potential at a distant point (where distance r from the dipole is much greater than the separation d between charges) by approximating certain distances as parallel.

1. **Approximation**: Since r >> d, the displacement vectors from each charge are nearly parallel, allowing simplifications.
2. **Difference in Distances**: The potential difference at point P arises due to different distances from the positive and negative charges, which can be expressed as \( d \cos(\theta) \), where θ is the angle between the dipole moment vector and the displacement vector to point P.
3. **Electric Potential Calculation**:
   - The electric potential \( V \) at point P is calculated by summing contributions from both charges of the dipole:  
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{q}{r_+} + \frac{-q}{r_-}\right)
     \]
   - Using approximations, this simplifies to:
     \[
     V = \frac{p \cos(\theta)}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}
     \]
   where \( p \) is the dipole moment (\( qd \)), θ is the angle as described, and \( r \) is the distance from the dipole to point P.

4. **Behavior Based on Angle**:
   - Maximum potential occurs at θ = 0° (along the axis towards the positive charge).
   - Minimum potential occurs at θ = 180° (along the axis towards the negative charge).
   - Zero potential is found perpendicular to the dipole axis where θ = 90°.

This explanation covers how the electric potential varies with both distance and angle from an electric dipole, emphasizing key approximations for cases where observation points are far relative to the dipole separation.

The text discusses how to determine the electric potential due to an electric dipole at a point P. An electric dipole consists of two charges, one positive and one negative, separated by a small distance \( d \). The key concept here is the electric dipole moment vector, which points from the negative charge to the positive charge.

The discussion focuses on calculating the electric potential at a point P that is much farther away from the dipole compared to the separation between the charges (\( r >> d \)). This allows for certain approximations: 

1. The lines connecting the charges to point P can be considered parallel.
2. The difference in distances from point P to each charge, \( r_+ - r_- \), is approximately equal to \( d \cos(\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle between the dipole moment vector and the displacement vector to point P.

The electric potential at a distance \( r \) and angle \( \theta \) from the dipole is derived by summing the potentials due to each charge. Using approximations, the expression for the potential \( V \) becomes:

\[ V = \frac{p \cos(\theta)}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2} \]

where \( p = qd \) is the dipole moment, \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the dipole moment vector and the displacement vector to point P.

The potential is maximum when \( \theta = 0^\circ \), zero when \( \theta = 90^\circ \), and negative when \( \theta = 180^\circ \). This indicates that the electric potential varies with both distance from the dipole and the orientation relative to the dipole moment.
