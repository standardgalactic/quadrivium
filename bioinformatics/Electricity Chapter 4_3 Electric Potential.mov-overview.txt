The text discusses how to determine the electric potential at a point P due to an electric dipole. An electric dipole consists of two opposite charges, with a vector from negative to positive called the dipole moment. The key focus is on calculating the electric potential at a distant point (where distance r from the dipole is much greater than the separation d between charges) by approximating certain distances as parallel.

1. **Approximation**: Since r >> d, the displacement vectors from each charge are nearly parallel, allowing simplifications.
2. **Difference in Distances**: The potential difference at point P arises due to different distances from the positive and negative charges, which can be expressed as \( d \cos(\theta) \), where θ is the angle between the dipole moment vector and the displacement vector to point P.
3. **Electric Potential Calculation**:
   - The electric potential \( V \) at point P is calculated by summing contributions from both charges of the dipole:  
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{q}{r_+} + \frac{-q}{r_-}\right)
     \]
   - Using approximations, this simplifies to:
     \[
     V = \frac{p \cos(\theta)}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}
     \]
   where \( p \) is the dipole moment (\( qd \)), θ is the angle as described, and \( r \) is the distance from the dipole to point P.

4. **Behavior Based on Angle**:
   - Maximum potential occurs at θ = 0° (along the axis towards the positive charge).
   - Minimum potential occurs at θ = 180° (along the axis towards the negative charge).
   - Zero potential is found perpendicular to the dipole axis where θ = 90°.

This explanation covers how the electric potential varies with both distance and angle from an electric dipole, emphasizing key approximations for cases where observation points are far relative to the dipole separation.
