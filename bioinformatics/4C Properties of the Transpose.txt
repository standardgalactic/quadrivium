As we build up, as I build up these lectures on linear algebra, I'll add some two ones that were made quite a while ago.
So with this, the previous lecture would have been just a transpose with a nice animation of what a transpose is.
But what I didn't add is just the five properties of a transpose.
First one, if I take a matrix A and I take its transpose, and I take the transpose, all that transpose, I'll go back to matrix A.
If I have matrix A, and I add matrix B, or subtract matrix B, and now that manipulation, I take the transpose.
It's the same as individually taking the transpose of the two matrix, and then adding or subtracting.
If I have some scalar, and I multiply by a matrix, and I take the transpose of that multiplication,
I might as well take the transpose of A, and then multiply it by the scalar. No difference.
Here's the first one that might give you some problems. If I multiply two matrices, two matrices, and I take its transpose,
it will be the same as multiplying, but in reverse order, the transpose of each matrix.
Okay, that's important. Do you remember? Last one's quite easy. If I take the transpose of the matrix,
and I take the inverse of the transpose, it will be the same as taking the inverse of the matrix, and then giving the transpose of that inverse.
So the five properties are the transpose of the matrix that you should know.
So I will maybe take that.
On the left of the matrix here, or maybe you can pass it.
Nice black part here.
I think this is the only one I would say my mailbox name is.
I'm paying up any fuIL one myself.
And if there are two of the five properties that imagine, you can be caught down.
I'm putting that green queen of Farm.
You're busy here.
Nervant, center, center, Arts, Pois !
And now it was the oldest, and I alwaysç›²ed it, and above the intriguing one,
because it was the first two parts of the matrix of the matrix.
