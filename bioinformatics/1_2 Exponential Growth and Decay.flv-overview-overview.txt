The text discusses solving and understanding separable first-order differential equations with initial value problems (IVPs). Here's a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: The given differential equation is:
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = x(\cos(y) + 5e^y) = 9x^2 - \sin(x).
   \]
   Variables are separated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\cos(y) + 5e^y} dy = (9x^2 - \sin(x)) dx.
   \]

2. **Integration**: The integration results in:
   - Left side: \(\int \frac{1}{\cos(y) + 5e^y} dy\) (not an elementary function).
   - Right side: \(\int (9x^2 - \sin(x)) dx = 3x^3 + \cos(x) + C\).

3. **Initial Condition**: Using \( y(0) = \pi \):
   \[
   \sin(\pi) + 5e^\pi = 1 + C,
   \]
   leading to \( C = 5e^\pi - 1 \).

4. **Specific Solution**: The solution is implicitly given by:
   \[
   \sin(y) + 5e^y = 3x^3 + \cos(x) + (5e^\pi - 1).
   \]

The main point is that while \( y \) cannot be expressed explicitly in terms of elementary functions, it can still be described implicitly as a function of \( x \).
