The text provides an overview of electric potential changes within a uniform electric field, emphasizing several key concepts:

1. **Electric Potential (V):** 
   - Defined as work done per unit charge to move a charge from infinity to a point in space.
   - In a uniform field, the change in potential is calculated as \( V = - E \cdot d \), with \(d\) being the displacement along the field.

2. **Equipotential Surfaces:**
   - These are surfaces where the electric potential remains constant.
   - In a uniform field, equipotential lines are perpendicular to the field lines and show no change in potential when moving along them (\( \Delta V = 0 \)).

3. **Path Independence:**
   - The electrostatic force is conservative; thus, the work done between two points depends only on their positions, not the path.
   - This means that the change in electric potential (\( \Delta V \)) between any two points remains constant regardless of the path taken.

4. **Example with Uniform Electric Field:**
   - Moving from point I to F along the field direction results in a decrease in potential (\( \Delta V = - E \cdot d \)).
   - Moving perpendicular to the field (e.g., C to F) yields no change in potential.
   - Different paths between two points result in the same net change in potential, demonstrating path independence.

Overall, the text underscores that electric potential changes are consistent across different paths within a uniform field due to the conservative nature of electrostatic forces.
