so let's have a look at a qq plot now qq plot really helps you to decide if if you're going
to use hypothesis testing and statistics whether to use parametric or non-parametric tests let's
have a look at that so again plot we are going to pass something new the stat argument here stat
dot qq statistics dot qq now let's have a look at what we have for our static x equals rand now
when i showed you how to do the save of a plot i did import the distributions package using
distributions chi square is one of the distributions that it can do and normal as well so chi square
takes one argument the lambda argument here so it says take random values from the chi square
distribution with a lambda value of one and please take 100 random data points from this distribution
randomly and attach it to the x aesthetic y equals just normal open closed parenthesis so that's the
normal distribution with the standard normal with a mean of zero standard deviation of one
and plot this as a geometry a point geometry but use the qq statistic on these aesthetic let me show you
what happens let's just see oh distributions let's just add that it seems that the kernel had stopped
in between so let's insert cell above and let's do that let's say using distributions
distributions there we go so let's run this code again this and there we go it will work now look at this
so on my x-axis i have my x values and this is a qq plot so it plots every point versus its quantile
and but it's using using using this normal for the y value if i put in normal here
these points should be on a straight line if these data point values were from a normal distribution
clearly they do not follow a straight line so clearly these values are not from a normal distribution and
indeed they weren't i cheated i put them as a chi square distribution with a lambda of one
so this plot tells me if i wanted to use these x values in hypothesis tests i should use a non-parametric
test now let's use that on some of our own data so what are we going to do so we're going to plot our x
as our variable one but i've got to sort it so i can say data frame the variable one column take all
those values sort them and that's my x aesthetic for my y aesthetic i've got to pass the normal
function because i just want to see whether this is the where the variable one does follow a normal
distribution but i can't just use open and close parentheses not standard normal distribution i've
got to give it a normal distribution based on the mean and standard deviation of all the values in
variable one so i've got to say mean data frame variable one comma standard deviation data frame
variable one so it's going to construct the mean and standard deviation from the values in variable
one and it's going to construct from that a normal distribution now it's going to look at each and every
value from the minimum to the maximum value it's going to apply the statistics this qq so it's going to
look at the quantile of each and what i'm doing here i am comparing it to a normal distribution let's see
if variable one followed a normal distribution indeed it didn't again these plots these dots are not on
the same line so once again if i was going to use variable one i should not use a parametric test
let's do exact the exact same thing for variable two so everything is the same i've just gone on to
variable two and indeed it looks like these points do fall on a straight line so i would suggest that
this the sample data was taken the the participants were taken from a from a population in which that
variable x or variable two in this instance was normally distributed so if i were to come do a
hypothesis test i would use a parametric test on this let's have a quick look at variable three
at variable three and again i'm doing the q the stat dot qq on a normal distribution so i could check
it against other distributions i could see whether this was in fact whether it followed a chi square
distribution with whatever lambda value i'm interested in so i could have put chi square there
and say for instance in parentheses just one for lambda equals one and it will change these if that
then becomes a straight line that would mean that this followed a chi square distribution and indeed
with this kind of distribution based on a qq statistic for a normal distribution based on the mean and
standard deviation of the values in variable three this does look to me like it was constructed as a
as a chi square distribution good in the next section we're going to revisit scatter plots and i'll show
you how much more you can do with the point geometry
