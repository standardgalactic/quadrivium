The text explores how permutations are used in calculating determinants for square matrices. Here's a breakdown:

### Key Concepts

#### Permutations
- **Definition**: A permutation rearranges elements of a set into a sequence.
- **Count**: For \( n \) elements, there are \( n! \) (n factorial) possible permutations.

#### Determinants and Permutations
- **Matrix Setup**: Consider an \( n \times n \) matrix \( A = [a_{ij}] \).
- **Permutation Role**: Permutations rearrange indices to compute determinants.
- **Sign of a Permutation**: 
  - Each permutation is either even or odd, determined by the number of inversions (where larger numbers precede smaller ones in order).
  - The sign \( \text{sgn}(\sigma) = (+1)^{\text{inv}(\sigma)} \), where \(\text{inv}(\sigma)\) is the inversion count.
- **Determinant Formula**: 
  \[
  \det(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \cdot a_{1,\sigma(1)} \cdot a_{2,\sigma(2)} \cdots a_{n,\sigma(n)}
  \]
  - \( S_n \) is the set of all permutations for indices 1 to \( n \).

### Example for a 3x3 Matrix

Given:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is calculated by considering all permutations of \(\{1, 2, 3\}\):

- Permutations with signs:
  - \( (1, 2, 3) \): \(\text{sgn} = +1\)
  - \( (1, 3, 2) \): \(\text{sgn} = -1\)
  - \( (2, 1, 3) \): \(\text{sgn} = -1\)
  - \( (2, 3, 1) \): \(\text{sgn} = +1\)
  - \( (3, 1, 2) \): \(\text{sgn} = +1\)
  - \( (3, 2, 1) \): \(\text{sgn} = -1\)

The determinant is:
\[
\det(A) = a_{11}a_{22}a_{33} - a_{11}a_{23}a_{32} - a_{12}a_{21}a_{33} + a_{12}a_{23}a_{31} + a_{13}a_{21}a_{32} - a_{13}a_{22}a_{31}
\]

This method can be generalized to any \( n \times n \) matrix by summing products of elements associated with permutations, adjusted by their signs.

### Additional Methods for Small Matrices
- **2x2 Matrix**: Use the formula: determinant = ad - bc.
- **3x3 Matrix**: An alternative is visualizing diagonals in an expanded grid to simplify calculation (sum filled diagonals, subtract empty ones).
