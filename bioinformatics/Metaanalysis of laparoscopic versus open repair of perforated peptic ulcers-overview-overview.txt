This literature review by Stavros Antonio et al., published in the Journal of the Society of Laparoscopic Surgeons (2013), evaluates a meta-analysis comparing laparoscopic and open repair methods for treating perforated peptic ulcers. Historically, open repair was standard; however, advancements like H2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, and laparoscopic techniques have influenced treatment approaches.

The review sought level 1 evidence to determine if laparoscopic repairs are superior to open repairs. The authors reviewed prospective randomized trials from databases such as MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register for Clinical Trials, identifying four eligible studies: three from China and one from the Netherlands, involving 289 patients.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes included operative morbidity, surgery duration, post-operative pain, length of stay, and complications like suture line leakage and respiratory failure. The analysis revealed no significant differences between laparoscopic and open repairs.

Study quality was assessed using the Jadad score; three studies scored fairly (3), while one scored poorly (2). The lack of statistical significance in outcomes indicates no evidence favoring laparoscopic repair over open repair. Consequently, the review calls for high-quality randomized controlled trials to justify the broader adoption of laparoscopic techniques for perforated peptic ulcers.
