In this section, I want to introduce the concept of flux.
Two things. First of all, we'll introduce it just in a two-dimensional coordinate system.
So we'll just have an x and y axis initially.
Then we can move it up to multivariable functions.
That's number one. And number two is, I want to remind you of the line integral.
And this is certainly the form integral over some curve of f dot dr.
Where f is a vector and r is a vector. And how did we introduce that?
Well, we said f is a vector field.
And this dr is this short little piece of the path curve that this particle travels on.
And because there's a dot product, it meant f in the direction of r.
So we introduced this in the form of work.
And we remembered from physics, work equals force times distance.
Work equals force times distance.
And that's how we introduced it.
Interesting though, we could have also written it like this.
Let's just work through this.
force, still the vector, dot product with this unit vector t.
And that t stands for tangent to the curve.
So instead of describing it as dr, we're describing it as t roof ds.
So ds is just the length of that little element of the line.
Just that tiny little element of the line.
So that is just a scalar.
Whereas dr here is a vector.
But it's a scalar times this vector.
And this vector has a size, a norm of just one.
But it does give direction to this line.
So one times anything just remains at anything.
So the length is still there.
And this vector just gives us the direction.
So this combined, you can clearly see, is dr.
And you'll see why we want to write this line integral in this fashion.
Because that will help us introduce flux.
Now flux in a two-dimensional plane.
As I said, here we used work equals force times distance.
We're going to introduce flux differently.
Where this vector field introduced a force at each point in this plane.
We're now going to see this vector not as a force but as a velocity vector.
So imagine there's a fluid.
Now fluid is a gas or a liquid.
Flows.
And at any point I can note a particle there.
And it flows in a certain direction at a certain speed.
So it has velocity at each and every point.
So we're going to see this vector as a velocity vector.
Not as a force vector.
And we're going to have this fluid pass this curve.
Pass this line at any one time.
So here F is seen as a velocity vector field.
Where it represents the velocity vector at each point in the two-dimensional plane.
So remember, here's just this tiny little element of the line.
And it's the tangent vector to that line multiplied by the length.
Which was just, which was just dr.
And now though, we want the component, not along, but the component along.
If I look in this direction, towards the right.
A normal vector, a normal unit vector.
Parallel, or perpendicular, perpendicular to this line segment dr.
Or tds.
This delta r.
If I just break this in little pieces.
I have delta r.
And remember, instead of expressing it like that.
We're now expressing it like this.
And perpendicular to that.
Always pointing towards the right by convention.
So this will give this bigger angle now.
Between f dot dn.
Dot dn.
And we can introduce it the same with the sigma notation.
The norm of the one vector times the norm of this vector.
Times the cosine of the angle between them.
Or if we just take the limit.
As these little line segments get smaller and smaller.
It becomes this line integral of f.
Vector f dot.
This normal vector n.
Perpendicular normal vector.
Ds.
So it's still going to represent some length.
Which is the length of this segment.
But just in a perpendicular direction.
So it's taking the length of that in a perpendicular direction.
And what we're doing here, in fact, is just the component of this along that.
So let's look at this.
So imagine I have this laminar flow.
So at every point, these particles flow in a certain direction.
And I want to see what the flux is along that line.
So how we are introducing it with the concepts of physics.
Is what volume in a very small tiny amount.
This travels through this line.
So you can actually try and visualize it in this fashion.
Try and visualize it in this fashion.
So we're going to have a certain area of this.
It's only two dimensions.
So a certain area.
And a small amount of time has passed.
So instead of moving the particle, I've just moved the line.
So that was the initial line.
And now time initial to time final.
So that's going to give me that area of fluid has passed through this line.
In the time difference between these two points.
Now, the component along a perpendicular unit vector to the line.
So there's our line segment.
And we've now taken that and blown it up.
So we just have a short little line segment now.
There is the perpendicular unit vector.
And there is the flow vector still.
So we're just looking for the component along this.
So that is going to be vector f dot this normal vector, vector 1.
And that gives us basically the area of this parallelogram.
You remember from linear algebra that this would be an equation for the area of this parallelogram.
And that is how we introduce this concept of flux.
That's how we introduce this concept of flux.
As fluid flow past this line.
And we'll have to introduce the concept of which direction is positive and which is negative.
As I say, the unit vector is always towards the right of this tangent vector.
No matter which direction the tangent vector points.
We always take because you could also have a normal vector in this direction.
But it's always the right hand side that we choose by convention.
So we are trying to get to the area of a parallelogram.
And that will give us the area of this.
And you can imagine if this wasn't a line but some surface.
But a three dimensional surface.
Then that would be volume that flows through there.
And then the flux would give us volume past a surface.
Imagine this was a circle in this direction.
Or it was just this open picture frame.
And how much fluid passed through that picture frame in a certain time.
So that would give us volume here.
It's going to give us area.
And it's just build around this concept of we need to get the area of this parallelogram.
And we can do that very easily by constructing this normal vector in this direction.
multiplying it by the length of this little line segment.
And getting the dot product with the velocity vector at that point.
And that will give us the area of this parallelogram.
And the area of this parallelogram is the area of fluid that passes through this line segment in a certain time.
Good. So we've just seen the flux just across a single line.
But I can also have a vector field in three dimensional space.
So it just goes out from the center of this.
And here I have my three dimensional, in this case it's a sphere.
But it needn't be a closed surface like this.
It can be an open surface, any surface in three space.
But then flux would be the amount, or seen as the amount of fluid that then passes through the surface in a certain time period.
An infinitesimally small time period.
If you wanted to see it like that.
So we're still going to have this double integral.
But see now it's over some surface.
And that is why we did surface integrals before.
We're going to land up with the same story.
That's f dot this normal vector.
And on a sphere like this.
At every point this will turn, this will point outwards.
With respect to that surface then.
So we can clearly see we're going to do problems here.
Which is nothing more than just surface integrals for this three dimensional flux.
So I can quickly see.
I'll be right back in the next one.
So, now let's get a few.
Thanks now.
I'm going to take a few months ahead of the cotes.
Coedです.
From place to the cotes.
To place.
Now I'm photo to use that with the cotes.
Wicked armpm Bots.
We're, my third a Finnish roof.
It's a little bit Help.
So from place to have aumentar the cotes.
Now I'll go for a fl�è and to use that a little bit for grabs,
