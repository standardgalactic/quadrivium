The text provides a detailed walkthrough on finding the equation of a tangent plane to a function in four-dimensional space. The given function is \( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). We aim to find the tangent plane at the point \( p = (1, 1, -1) \).

Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Evaluate the Function at Point \( p \):**
   \[
   f(1, 1, -1) = 1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate \( x - p \):**
   For a vector \( x = (x, y, z) \), the difference is:
   \[
   x - p = (x-1, y-1, z+1)
   \]

3. **Find the Gradient of \( f \):**
   The gradient \( \nabla f(x, y, z) \) is calculated by taking partial derivatives:
   \[
   \nabla f = (2x, 2y, 2z)
   \]
   At point \( p = (1, 1, -1) \), the gradient becomes:
   \[
   \nabla f(1, 1, -1) = (2, 2, -2)
   \]

4. **Formulate the Tangent Plane Equation:**
   The equation of the tangent plane is given by:
   \[
   t(x, y, z) = f(p) + \nabla f(p) \cdot ((x, y, z) - p)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   t(x, y, z) = 3 + (2, 2, -2) \cdot (x-1, y-1, z+1)
   \]
   Calculate the dot product:
   \[
   = 3 + (2(x-1) + 2(y-1) - 2(z+1))
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   = 3 + (2x - 2 + 2y - 2 - 2z - 2)
   \]
   \[
   = 2x + 2y - 2z - 3
   \]

5. **Verify the Tangency Condition:**
   To confirm that this is indeed a tangent plane, verify:
   \[
   \lim_{(x, y, z) \to (1, 1, -1)} \frac{f(x, y, z) - t(x, y, z)}{\|(x, y, z) - p\|} = 0
   \]
   This ensures that the plane is tangent to the surface at point \( p \).

The resulting equation of the tangent plane is:
\[ 
2x + 2y - 2z - 3 = 0 
\]

The text describes a mathematical process involving algebraic expressions and limits. Initially, it involves manipulating terms with negatives and squares:

1. Starting expressions include: \(-2y\), \(1\) negative \(1\), \(+z^2\), \(-2z\).
2. It explains that distributing a minus sign changes the signs of terms within parentheses.
3. The text revises to get an expression involving \(+3\) and other constants, simplifying to \(+1 + 1 + 1\).

Next, it discusses dividing by a norm:

4. The norm is derived from \((x - p)\), leading to the formula for distance in three-dimensional space: 
   \[
   \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z+1)^2}
   \]
5. Simplified, this expression remains under a square root.

Finally, it calculates the limit:

6. The limit is evaluated as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) approach specific values: \(1, 1, -1\).
7. Substituting these into the simplified formula results in zero because each squared term becomes zero:
   \[
   \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 + (-1+1)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 0 + 0} = 0
   \]

The entire process is about simplifying algebraic expressions and evaluating a limit that results in zero.

The text describes the derivation of an equation for a tangent hyperplane to a function at a specific point in 4-dimensional space. It emphasizes that the limits and equations involved equate to zero, validating the correctness of this tangent hyperplane equation. The discussion appears somewhat fragmented but revolves around mathematical concepts, including derivatives and geometric interpretations in higher dimensions.
