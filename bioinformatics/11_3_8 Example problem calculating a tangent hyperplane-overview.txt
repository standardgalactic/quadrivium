The text provides a detailed walkthrough on finding the equation of a tangent plane to a function in four-dimensional space. The given function is \( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). We aim to find the tangent plane at the point \( p = (1, 1, -1) \).

Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Evaluate the Function at Point \( p \):**
   \[
   f(1, 1, -1) = 1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate \( x - p \):**
   For a vector \( x = (x, y, z) \), the difference is:
   \[
   x - p = (x-1, y-1, z+1)
   \]

3. **Find the Gradient of \( f \):**
   The gradient \( \nabla f(x, y, z) \) is calculated by taking partial derivatives:
   \[
   \nabla f = (2x, 2y, 2z)
   \]
   At point \( p = (1, 1, -1) \), the gradient becomes:
   \[
   \nabla f(1, 1, -1) = (2, 2, -2)
   \]

4. **Formulate the Tangent Plane Equation:**
   The equation of the tangent plane is given by:
   \[
   t(x, y, z) = f(p) + \nabla f(p) \cdot ((x, y, z) - p)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   t(x, y, z) = 3 + (2, 2, -2) \cdot (x-1, y-1, z+1)
   \]
   Calculate the dot product:
   \[
   = 3 + (2(x-1) + 2(y-1) - 2(z+1))
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   = 3 + (2x - 2 + 2y - 2 - 2z - 2)
   \]
   \[
   = 2x + 2y - 2z - 3
   \]

5. **Verify the Tangency Condition:**
   To confirm that this is indeed a tangent plane, verify:
   \[
   \lim_{(x, y, z) \to (1, 1, -1)} \frac{f(x, y, z) - t(x, y, z)}{\|(x, y, z) - p\|} = 0
   \]
   This ensures that the plane is tangent to the surface at point \( p \).

The resulting equation of the tangent plane is:
\[ 
2x + 2y - 2z - 3 = 0 
\]

The text describes a mathematical process involving algebraic expressions and limits. Initially, it involves manipulating terms with negatives and squares:

1. Starting expressions include: \(-2y\), \(1\) negative \(1\), \(+z^2\), \(-2z\).
2. It explains that distributing a minus sign changes the signs of terms within parentheses.
3. The text revises to get an expression involving \(+3\) and other constants, simplifying to \(+1 + 1 + 1\).

Next, it discusses dividing by a norm:

4. The norm is derived from \((x - p)\), leading to the formula for distance in three-dimensional space: 
   \[
   \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z+1)^2}
   \]
5. Simplified, this expression remains under a square root.

Finally, it calculates the limit:

6. The limit is evaluated as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) approach specific values: \(1, 1, -1\).
7. Substituting these into the simplified formula results in zero because each squared term becomes zero:
   \[
   \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 + (-1+1)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 0 + 0} = 0
   \]

The entire process is about simplifying algebraic expressions and evaluating a limit that results in zero.

The text describes the derivation of an equation for a tangent hyperplane to a function at a specific point in 4-dimensional space. It emphasizes that the limits and equations involved equate to zero, validating the correctness of this tangent hyperplane equation. The discussion appears somewhat fragmented but revolves around mathematical concepts, including derivatives and geometric interpretations in higher dimensions.

The text describes the process of finding the equation for a tangent plane (hyperplane in four dimensions) to the function \( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) at the point \( p = (1, 1, -1) \).

1. **Function Value at Point**: 
   - Calculate \( f(p) = f(1, 1, -1) = 1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 = 3 \).

2. **Vector Calculation**:
   - For a vector \( x = (x, y, z) \), compute \( x - p = (x-1, y-1, z+1) \).

3. **Gradient of the Function**:
   - The gradient \( \nabla f(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z) \).
   - At point \( p \), this becomes \( \nabla f(1, 1, -1) = (2, 2, -2) \).

4. **Equation of the Tangent Plane**:
   - Use the dot product for the tangent plane equation: 
     \[
     t(x) = f(p) + \nabla f(p) \cdot ((x, y, z) - p)
     \]
   - Substitute values:
     \[
     t(x) = 3 + (2, 2, -2) \cdot (x-1, y-1, z+1)
     \]
   - Calculate the dot product:
     \[
     2(x-1) + 2(y-1) - 2(z+1) = 2x - 2 + 2y - 2 - 2z - 2
     \]
   - Simplify to get:
     \[
     2x + 2y - 2z - 6
     \]

5. **Final Tangent Plane Equation**:
   - Combine with \( f(p) = 3 \):
     \[
     t(x) = 2x + 2y - 2z - 3
     \]

6. **Verification of Tangency**:
   - Show that the limit as \( (x, y, z) \to (1, 1, -1) \) of 
     \[
     \frac{f(x, y, z) - t(x)}{\| (x, y, z) - p \|} = 0
     \]
   - This confirms that \( t(x) \) is indeed the tangent plane at \( p \).

The text outlines the steps to derive and verify the equation of a tangent hyperplane for a given function at a specified point.

The text appears to be a step-by-step explanation of simplifying an expression and evaluating a limit. Here's a summary:

1. **Expression Simplification:**
   - Start with terms involving variables \( y \) and \( z \): 
     - A negative term \(-2y\)
     - Another term simplified from \((1)(-1)\) to \(-1\)
     - Terms involving \( z \): \(z^2\) and \(-2z\)
   - Distribute a minus sign, turning \(-2z\) into \(+2z\).
   - Add constants: \(+3\), which becomes \(+1 + 1 + 1\) after correction.
   - Combine terms to get the simplified expression.

2. **Norm Calculation:**
   - Calculate the norm of a vector \((x-p)\) where \(p = (1, 1, -1)\).
   - The norm involves squaring differences: 
     - \((x-1)^2\), \((y-1)^2\), and \((z+1)^2\)
   - Take the square root of the sum of these squares.

3. **Limit Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the limit as \( (X, Y, Z) \to (1, 1, -1) \).
   - Substitute values into the expression:
     - \(x-1 = 0\), \(y-1 = 0\), and \(z+1 = 0\)
   - The result is the square root of zero, which simplifies to zero.

Overall, the process involves algebraic manipulation, calculating a vector norm, and evaluating a limit.

The text describes a mathematical analysis where a function in 4-dimensional space is considered. It confirms that the equation for the tangent hyperplane at a specific point is equal to zero, both in terms of the original value and its limit. This indicates the correctness of identifying the tangent hyperplane's equation at that particular point in the function within the higher-dimensional context. The text uses various linguistic expressions and possibly placeholders or transliterations ("당연hal," "Gerade," "оно") to emphasize different aspects of this mathematical observation.
