The text discusses the concept of the kernel of a group homomorphism. A homomorphism \( F \) maps elements from group \( G \) to group \( H \), and its kernel consists of all elements in \( G \) that map to the identity element in \( H \). The kernel is denoted as \( \text{kernel}(F) \).

To show that the kernel is a subgroup of \( G \), we need to verify three properties:

1. **Closure**: For any two elements \( A, B \in \text{kernel}(F) \), their binary operation in \( G \) also maps to the identity element in \( H \). This follows from the homomorphism property: \( F(A \cdot B) = F(A) \cdot F(B) = e_H \cdot e_H = e_H \).

2. **Identity**: The identity element of \( G \), denoted as \( e_G \), is in the kernel because \( F(e_G) = e_H \).

3. **Inverses**: If an element \( A \in \text{kernel}(F) \), then its inverse \( A^{-1} \) is also in the kernel. This is shown by \( F(A^{-1}) = (F(A))^{-1} = e_H^{-1} = e_H \).

Additionally, the kernel is a normal subgroup of \( G \). This means for any element \( g \in G \) and any element \( h \in \text{kernel}(F) \), the conjugate \( g \cdot h \cdot g^{-1} \) is also in the kernel. This follows because:

\[ F(g \cdot h \cdot g^{-1}) = F(g) \cdot F(h) \cdot F(g^{-1}) = F(g) \cdot e_H \cdot F(g)^{-1} = F(g) \cdot F(g)^{-1} = e_H. \]

The kernel's properties provide insights into group structure and lead to the First Isomorphism Theorem, which relates homomorphisms to quotient groups and isomorphic structures.
