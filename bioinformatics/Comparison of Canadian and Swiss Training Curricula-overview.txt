This text is from Jean Topper's introduction to a discussion on surgical education, focusing on a comparison between Canadian and Swiss surgical training curricula. The primary aim is to evaluate the shift towards competency-based education due to reduced trainee working hours, which affects both safety and quality of training.

In Switzerland, trainees are limited to a 50-hour workweek, while in Canada, the cap is 80 hours. This reduction aims to minimize fatigue-related risks but raises concerns about the impact on training quality and patient safety, with mixed reports supporting either stance.

The authors suggest transitioning from time-based to competency-based curricula, highlighting initiatives for implementing structured frameworks for evidence-based training models. They emphasize using validated tools for assessing trainees' competencies across various domains.

The study reviewed involved an online survey conducted at academic teaching hospitals in Switzerland and Canada between September and October 2014. The questionnaire covered demographics, nature of training programs, and perspectives on training under duty-hour restrictions. Key elements assessed included tutorial lectures, virtual reality simulations, surgical skills training, teaching ward rounds, objective assessments of technical and non-technical skills, performance benchmarks, and post-operative debriefings.

The survey aimed to identify structured versus ad hoc training systems by determining if these elements were regularly provided within the programs, ultimately guiding potential enhancements in surgical education.

The text presents findings from an online survey conducted among consultants and trainees in Switzerland and Canada regarding surgical training programs. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Response Rate**: The survey achieved a 37% response rate with 105 respondents out of 284, which is considered low but still provides valuable insights.

2. **Training Structure**: In Switzerland, only 25% of consultants and 3% of trainees felt their training was structured compared to significantly higher percentages in Canada (86% consultants, 75% trainees).

3. **Informal Teaching**: There were fairly similar perceptions regarding informal ad hoc tutorial assistance in the operating room between the two countries. However, Swiss consultants believed more strongly in its presence than Swiss trainees did.

4. **Ward Rounds and Duty Hours**: A large portion of both Swiss and Canadian participants acknowledged informal teaching during ward rounds. Median weekly duty hours were reported at 60 for Swiss consultants and trainees, while Canadian trainees averaged 80 hours.

5. **Surgical Training Time**: There was a stark contrast in median weekly formal structured surgical training hours, with much less occurring in Switzerland compared to Canada.

6. **Virtual Reality (VR) Training**: Both groups recognized the importance of VR simulation for improving technical skills, especially as traditional operative experience decreases due to reduced duty hours and fellowship-based programs.

7. **Training Outside the OR**: There was broad agreement that training outside the operating room can enhance patient safety, surgical skills, and potentially post-operative outcomes, though fewer trainees felt it improves outcomes compared to consultants.

8. **Experience with VR and Skills Labs**: Less than half of Swiss trainees had experience with VR training or surgical skills labs, whereas nearly all Canadian trainees reported such experiences.

9. **Perception of Reduced Surgical Experience**: A majority of Swiss consultants believed reduced hours led to less surgical experience for trainees, though fewer trainees agreed with this sentiment.

10. **Acceptance of Reduced Hours**: The acceptance of reduced working hours varied significantly, with only about half in each group finding it acceptable.

In conclusion, the study highlights differences between Switzerland and Canada regarding perceptions of training structure, informal teaching, duty hours, and the use of innovative methods like VR to address challenges posed by reduced operative experience. It underscores a gap in perception between consultants and trainees, particularly concerning the impacts of reduced working hours on surgical experience.

The text encourages readers to consider developing their own curricula while also comparing them with those from institutions in Canada and Switzerland. It suggests reading a detailed article accessible via a provided link, emphasizing its value as a resource worth keeping on file for future reference. The intent is likely to inspire innovation and improvement in educational practices by learning from international examples.

This edition of "Literature in Surgical Education" features Jean Topper discussing a journal article from the January and February 2017 issue of the Journal of Surgical Education. The study compares Canadian and Swiss surgical training curricula, focusing on the shift towards competency-based education.

Key points include:

1. **Work Hours**: Switzerland enforces a 50-hour workweek for trainees, while Canada caps it at 80 hours, aiming to reduce fatigue and enhance patient safety.
   
2. **Impact on Training**: There are mixed reports on whether reducing working hours affects the quality and quantity of training and its impact on patient safety.

3. **Curriculum Transformation**: The authors advocate transitioning from time-based to competency-based programs, emphasizing structured curricula and validated assessment tools.

4. **Study Details**: A cohort study using an online survey (40 questions) was conducted between September and October 2014 at academic hospitals in Switzerland and Canada. It assessed demographics, training program nature, and views on duty-hour restrictions.

5. **Training Elements**: Evaluated components include tutorial lectures, virtual reality simulations, surgical skills training, teaching rounds, objective skill assessments, performance benchmarks, and post-operative debriefings.

6. **Structured vs. Ad Hoc Training**: Programs were classified as structured if most elements were regularly provided; otherwise, they were considered ad hoc.

The study aims to identify opportunities for enhancing surgical training programs by comparing essential training elements in both countries.

The text presents findings from an online survey comparing surgical training perceptions between consultants and trainees in Switzerland and Canada. Here's a summary:

1. **Response Rate & Respondent Numbers**: The response rate was 37%, with 105 respondents out of 284, which is considered reasonable for online surveys.

2. **Training Structure**:
   - In Switzerland, only 25% of consultants believed their training programs were structured, compared to 86% in Canada.
   - For trainees, the perception of structure was even lower at 3% in Switzerland versus 75% in Canada.

3. **Informal Teaching and Assistance**:
   - There was a general agreement on the presence of informal ad hoc tutorial assistance in the OR (over 50% across both countries).
   - Informal teaching ward rounds were also perceived positively, with over 60% agreement among Swiss consultants and slightly higher rates in Canada.

4. **Duty Hours**:
   - Median weekly duty hours for both Swiss consultants and trainees stood at 60 hours.
   - Canadian trainees reported higher mean weekly duty hours of 80%.

5. **Structured Surgical Training**:
   - There was a significant difference in median formal structured surgical training hours between the countries: Switzerland had just 1.25 hours compared to Canada's 7-8 hours.

6. **Dedicated Teaching Time**:
   - A considerable disparity existed between Canadian and Swiss groups regarding dedicated teaching time.

7. **Virtual Reality (VR) Training**:
   - High support was noted for VR training as a method to improve technical skills, with almost all respondents acknowledging its importance.
   - However, less than 50% of Swiss trainees had VR experience compared to nearly 90% of Canadian trainees.

8. **Surgical Skills Lab Experience**:
   - About half of the Swiss trainees had some surgical skills lab training versus almost 100% in Canada.

9. **Perception of Reduced Surgical Opportunities**:
   - A majority (75%) of Swiss consultants believed that trainees were performing less surgery due to reduced hours, though only half of the trainees agreed.
   - This perception was similarly noted by Canadian consultants but with lower agreement from Canadian trainees.

10. **Acceptability of Reduced Hours**:
    - Only about 65% of Basel consultants found reduced hours acceptable, with significantly lower acceptance among Swiss and Canadian trainees.

In conclusion, the survey highlights substantial differences in perceptions between Switzerland and Canada regarding surgical training structure, informal teaching methods, and experiences with modern training tools like VR. There is also a notable discrepancy in views on duty hours and their impact on clinical experience. The findings suggest a need for enhanced structured training opportunities to improve surgical education and outcomes.
