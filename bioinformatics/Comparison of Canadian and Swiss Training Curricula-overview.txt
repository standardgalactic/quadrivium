This text is from Jean Topper's introduction to a discussion on surgical education, focusing on a comparison between Canadian and Swiss surgical training curricula. The primary aim is to evaluate the shift towards competency-based education due to reduced trainee working hours, which affects both safety and quality of training.

In Switzerland, trainees are limited to a 50-hour workweek, while in Canada, the cap is 80 hours. This reduction aims to minimize fatigue-related risks but raises concerns about the impact on training quality and patient safety, with mixed reports supporting either stance.

The authors suggest transitioning from time-based to competency-based curricula, highlighting initiatives for implementing structured frameworks for evidence-based training models. They emphasize using validated tools for assessing trainees' competencies across various domains.

The study reviewed involved an online survey conducted at academic teaching hospitals in Switzerland and Canada between September and October 2014. The questionnaire covered demographics, nature of training programs, and perspectives on training under duty-hour restrictions. Key elements assessed included tutorial lectures, virtual reality simulations, surgical skills training, teaching ward rounds, objective assessments of technical and non-technical skills, performance benchmarks, and post-operative debriefings.

The survey aimed to identify structured versus ad hoc training systems by determining if these elements were regularly provided within the programs, ultimately guiding potential enhancements in surgical education.

The text presents findings from an online survey conducted among consultants and trainees in Switzerland and Canada regarding surgical training programs. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Response Rate**: The survey achieved a 37% response rate with 105 respondents out of 284, which is considered low but still provides valuable insights.

2. **Training Structure**: In Switzerland, only 25% of consultants and 3% of trainees felt their training was structured compared to significantly higher percentages in Canada (86% consultants, 75% trainees).

3. **Informal Teaching**: There were fairly similar perceptions regarding informal ad hoc tutorial assistance in the operating room between the two countries. However, Swiss consultants believed more strongly in its presence than Swiss trainees did.

4. **Ward Rounds and Duty Hours**: A large portion of both Swiss and Canadian participants acknowledged informal teaching during ward rounds. Median weekly duty hours were reported at 60 for Swiss consultants and trainees, while Canadian trainees averaged 80 hours.

5. **Surgical Training Time**: There was a stark contrast in median weekly formal structured surgical training hours, with much less occurring in Switzerland compared to Canada.

6. **Virtual Reality (VR) Training**: Both groups recognized the importance of VR simulation for improving technical skills, especially as traditional operative experience decreases due to reduced duty hours and fellowship-based programs.

7. **Training Outside the OR**: There was broad agreement that training outside the operating room can enhance patient safety, surgical skills, and potentially post-operative outcomes, though fewer trainees felt it improves outcomes compared to consultants.

8. **Experience with VR and Skills Labs**: Less than half of Swiss trainees had experience with VR training or surgical skills labs, whereas nearly all Canadian trainees reported such experiences.

9. **Perception of Reduced Surgical Experience**: A majority of Swiss consultants believed reduced hours led to less surgical experience for trainees, though fewer trainees agreed with this sentiment.

10. **Acceptance of Reduced Hours**: The acceptance of reduced working hours varied significantly, with only about half in each group finding it acceptable.

In conclusion, the study highlights differences between Switzerland and Canada regarding perceptions of training structure, informal teaching, duty hours, and the use of innovative methods like VR to address challenges posed by reduced operative experience. It underscores a gap in perception between consultants and trainees, particularly concerning the impacts of reduced working hours on surgical experience.

The text encourages readers to consider developing their own curricula while also comparing them with those from institutions in Canada and Switzerland.
