To find the equation of a plane given three points in space, you can use vector algebra. Here's how you can derive the equation step-by-step:

### Given Points
Let's denote the three points as \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \), \( P_2(2, 3, 1) \), and \( P_3(3, -1, 2) \).

### Step 1: Find Two Vectors in the Plane
Choose one point as a common vertex to form two vectors that lie in the plane. Let's use \( P_1 \):

- Vector \( \mathbf{v}_1 = P_2 - P_1 = (2 - 1, 3 - 2, 1 + 1) = (1, 1, 2) \)
- Vector \( \mathbf{v}_2 = P_3 - P_1 = (3 - 1, -1 - 2, 2 + 1) = (2, -3, 3) \)

### Step 2: Find the Normal Vector
The normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of \( \mathbf{v}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{v}_2 \):

\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v}_1 \times \mathbf{v}_2 = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & -3 & 3
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculate the determinant:

- \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \( (1)(3) - (-3)(2) = 3 + 6 = 9 \)
- \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \( -( (1)(3) - (2)(2) ) = -(3 - 4) = 1 \)
- \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \( (1)(-3) - (1)(2) = -3 - 2 = -5 \)

Thus, the normal vector is \( \mathbf{n} = (9, 1, -5) \).

### Step 3: Equation of the Plane
The general form of the equation of a plane is:

\[
ax + by + cz = d
\]

where \( (a, b, c) \) is the normal vector. Substitute \( \mathbf{n} = (9, 1, -5) \):

\[
9x + y - 5z = d
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( d \)
Substitute one of the given points into the plane equation to solve for \( d \). Using point \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \):

\[
9(1) + 1(2) - 5(-1) = d \\
9 + 2 + 5 = d \\
d = 16
\]

### Final Equation of the Plane
The equation of the plane is:

\[
9x + y - 5z = 16
\]

This equation represents the plane passing through the points \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \), \( P_2(2, 3, 1) \), and \( P_3(3, -1, 2) \).

The text appears to be a somewhat disorganized discussion about setting up and understanding equations related to planes in geometry. Here is a summary of the main points:

1. **Setup Instructions**: The speaker suggests setting up various configurations, such as "P," "P2," or "P3," which likely refer to points used to define a plane.

2. **Equation of a Plane**: It's mentioned that these setups will lead to a specific equation representing the general form of a plane’s equation.

3. **Challenges and Observations**: The speaker notes potential difficulties in visualizing or working with these concepts, especially when referring to point "P3" and other elements like "little dots."

4. **Reminder for Review**: There's an encouragement to review previous results or steps ("Take results of some of these.") to better understand the process.

5. **Further Details**: The text includes references to examining specific locations of points (like "P4") and suggests that certain actions will lead to a particular outcome, possibly in the context of checking calculations or understanding geometric relationships.

The overall message seems to emphasize setting up equations for planes using points and reviewing past work to ensure accurate understanding.

To find the equation of a plane given three points \( P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) \), \( P_2(x_2, y_2, z_2) \), and \( P_3(x_3, y_3, z_3) \), you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Find Two Vectors in the Plane

First, choose one of the points as a reference point. Let's use \( P_1 \). Then, create two vectors that lie on the plane using this point and the other two points:

- Vector \( \mathbf{v}_1 = P_2 - P_1 = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1) \)
- Vector \( \mathbf{v}_2 = P_3 - P_1 = (x_3 - x_1, y_3 - y_1, z_3 - z_1) \)

### Step 2: Find the Normal Vector

The normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \) to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of \( \mathbf{v}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{v}_2 \):

\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v}_1 \times \mathbf{v}_2 = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
x_2 - x_1 & y_2 - y_1 & z_2 - z_1 \\
x_3 - x_1 & y_3 - y_1 & z_3 - z_1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculate the determinant:

- \( n_x = (y_2 - y_1)(z_3 - z_1) - (z_2 - z_1)(y_3 - y_1) \)
- \( n_y = (z_2 - z_1)(x_3 - x_1) - (x_2 - x_1)(z_3 - z_1) \)
- \( n_z = (x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (y_2 - y_1)(x_3 - x_1) \)

### Step 3: Write the Equation of the Plane

The equation of the plane can be written as:

\[
n_x(x - x_1) + n_y(y - y_1) + n_z(z - z_1) = 0
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
n_x x + n_y y + n_z z = d
\]

where \( d = n_x x_1 + n_y y_1 + n_z z_1 \).

### Example

Suppose the points are \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \), \( P_2(2, 3, 1) \), and \( P_3(3, 0, 2) \).

- Vector \( \mathbf{v}_1 = (2 - 1, 3 - 2, 1 + 1) = (1, 1, 2) \)
- Vector \( \mathbf{v}_2 = (3 - 1, 0 - 2, 2 + 1) = (2, -2, 3) \)

Calculate the cross product:

\[
\mathbf{n} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & -2 & 3
\end{vmatrix}
= (1 \cdot 3 - 2 \cdot (-2))\mathbf{i} - (1 \cdot 3 - 2 \cdot 2)\mathbf{j} + (1 \cdot (-2) - 1 \cdot 2)\mathbf{k}
\]

\[
= (3 + 4)\mathbf{i} - (3 - 4)\mathbf{j} + (-2 - 2)\mathbf{k}
\]

\[
= 7\mathbf{i} + 1\mathbf{j} - 4\mathbf{k}
\]

So, the normal vector is \( \mathbf{n} = (7, 1, -4) \).

The equation of the plane is:

\[
7(x - 1) + 1(y - 2) - 4(z + 1) = 0
\]

Expanding:

\[
7x - 7 + y - 2 - 4z - 4 = 0
\]

\[
7x + y - 4z = 13
\]

This is the equation of the plane.

The text appears to discuss setting up equations for planes in three-dimensional space. Here’s a summary:

1. **Setup Process**: The speaker suggests setting up two specific plane equations, referred to as P and its variants (P2, P3). These setups will result in a general form of the equation of a plane.

2. **Equation Formulation**: By establishing these planes, you'll arrive at a standard equation representing a plane in three-dimensional space.

3. **Complexities and Observations**: There is an acknowledgment that analyzing certain configurations (like looking at P3) can be challenging due to visual or conceptual complexities, such as small dots or intricate details.

4. **Memory and Results**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of remembering results from previous setups and suggests they can aid in understanding current problems.

5. **Pressure Reference**: There's a mention of "pressure," which might refer metaphorically to the complexity or difficulty of dealing with these equations, but it is unclear without further context.

6. **Location of Points**: The speaker mentions examining specific points (like P4) and their roles within the plane equation setup, suggesting this as part of understanding the overall configuration.

Overall, the text outlines a process for deriving general plane equations while acknowledging potential difficulties in visualizing or conceptualizing certain aspects of these setups.
