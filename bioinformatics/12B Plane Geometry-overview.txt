To find the equation of a plane given three points in space, you can use vector algebra. Here's how you can derive the equation step-by-step:

### Given Points
Let's denote the three points as \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \), \( P_2(2, 3, 1) \), and \( P_3(3, -1, 2) \).

### Step 1: Find Two Vectors in the Plane
Choose one point as a common vertex to form two vectors that lie in the plane. Let's use \( P_1 \):

- Vector \( \mathbf{v}_1 = P_2 - P_1 = (2 - 1, 3 - 2, 1 + 1) = (1, 1, 2) \)
- Vector \( \mathbf{v}_2 = P_3 - P_1 = (3 - 1, -1 - 2, 2 + 1) = (2, -3, 3) \)

### Step 2: Find the Normal Vector
The normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of \( \mathbf{v}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{v}_2 \):

\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v}_1 \times \mathbf{v}_2 = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & -3 & 3
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculate the determinant:

- \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \( (1)(3) - (-3)(2) = 3 + 6 = 9 \)
- \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \( -( (1)(3) - (2)(2) ) = -(3 - 4) = 1 \)
- \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \( (1)(-3) - (1)(2) = -3 - 2 = -5 \)

Thus, the normal vector is \( \mathbf{n} = (9, 1, -5) \).

### Step 3: Equation of the Plane
The general form of the equation of a plane is:

\[
ax + by + cz = d
\]

where \( (a, b, c) \) is the normal vector. Substitute \( \mathbf{n} = (9, 1, -5) \):

\[
9x + y - 5z = d
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( d \)
Substitute one of the given points into the plane equation to solve for \( d \). Using point \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \):

\[
9(1) + 1(2) - 5(-1) = d \\
9 + 2 + 5 = d \\
d = 16
\]

### Final Equation of the Plane
The equation of the plane is:

\[
9x + y - 5z = 16
\]

This equation represents the plane passing through the points \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \), \( P_2(2, 3, 1) \), and \( P_3(3, -1, 2) \).

The text appears to be a somewhat disorganized discussion about setting up and understanding equations related to planes in geometry. Here is a summary of the main points:

1. **Setup Instructions**: The speaker suggests setting up various configurations, such as "P," "P2," or "P3," which likely refer to points used to define a plane.

2. **Equation of a Plane**: It's mentioned that these setups will lead to a specific equation representing the general form of a planeâ€™s equation.

3. **Challenges and Observations**: The speaker notes potential difficulties in visualizing or working with these concepts, especially when referring to point "P3" and other elements like "little dots."

4. **Reminder for Review**: There's an encouragement to review previous results or steps ("Take results of some of these.") to better understand the process.

5. **Further Details**: The text includes references to examining specific locations of points (like "P4") and suggests that certain actions will lead to a particular outcome, possibly in the context of checking calculations or understanding geometric relationships.

The overall message seems to emphasize setting up equations for planes using points and reviewing past work to ensure accurate understanding.
