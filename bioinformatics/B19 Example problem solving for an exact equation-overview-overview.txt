The text outlines solving an initial value problem for a differential equation by identifying it as an exact equation. The given differential equation:

\[
(xy^2 - \cos x \sin x) \, dx = (y(1 - x^2)) \, dy
\]

is rearranged into the form:

\[
M(x, y) \, dx + N(x, y) \, dy = 0,
\]

where \( M(x, y) = xy^2 - \cos x \sin x \) and \( N(x, y) = -y(x^2 - 1) \).

To verify exactness, the partial derivatives are checked:

\[
\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 2xy,
\]

confirming that the equation is exact.

The solution involves finding a potential function \( f(x, y) \) such that:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = M(x, y) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = N(x, y).
\]

Integrating \( M \) with respect to \( x \), the potential function is found:

\[
f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + h(x).
\]

Differentiating this with respect to \( y \) and setting it equal to \( N(x, y) \), we find:

\[
h'(x) = \cos x - \sin x.
\]

Integrating gives:

\[
h(x) = \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x + C.
\]

Thus, the potential function is:

\[
f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x + C.
\]

Using the initial condition \( x = 0, y = 2 \), we find \( C = 0 \).

The solution to the differential equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]

Multiplying through by \(-2\) results in:

\[
y^2 - x^2y^2 - \cos^2 x = 3.
\]

Factoring out \( y^2 \) gives:

\[
y^2(1 - x^2) - \cos^2 x = 3.
\]

The text concludes with an algebraic expression, suggesting further manipulation to solve for a variable explicitly.
