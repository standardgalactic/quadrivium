To solve this problem, we need to calculate the magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) generated by an infinitely long wire carrying current and then determine the magnetic force experienced by a moving proton at a perpendicular distance from the wire.

### Step 1: Magnetic Field Due to the Wire

The magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) around an infinitely long straight wire is given by Amp√®re's law:

\[
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\]

where:
- \( B \) is the magnitude of the magnetic field,
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A} \) (permeability of free space),
- \( I \) is the current through the wire,
- \( d \) is the perpendicular distance from the wire to the point where the field is being calculated.

The direction of \( \mathbf{B} \) can be determined using the right-hand rule: if you point your thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. At a point above the wire, this will result in \( \mathbf{B} \) pointing out of the plane (positive z-direction).

So, the vector form of \( \mathbf{B} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{B} = \left(0, 0, \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Magnetic Force on a Moving Proton

The force \( \mathbf{F} \) experienced by a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force law:

\[
\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
\]

where:
- \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (charge of a proton),
- \( \mathbf{v} = (0, -v, 0) \) is the velocity vector of the proton moving downward,
- \( \mathbf{B} = \left(0, 0, \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) \).

### Step 3: Cross Product Calculation

Calculate the cross product \( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \):

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
0 & -v & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\end{vmatrix}
= \mathbf{i} \left((-v) \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d} - 0 \right) - \mathbf{j} (0 - 0) + \mathbf{k} (0 - 0)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
= \left(-v \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) \mathbf{i}
\]

Thus, the force \( \mathbf{F} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{F} = q \left(-v \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) \mathbf{i} = -q v \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d} \mathbf{i}
\]

### Conclusion

The magnetic force on the proton is directed in the negative x-direction (to the left, if we assume rightward as positive x), with a magnitude:

\[
F = q v \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\]

This force acts perpendicular to both the velocity of the proton and the magnetic field direction.
