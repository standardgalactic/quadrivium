To solve this problem, we need to calculate the magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) generated by an infinitely long wire carrying current and then determine the magnetic force experienced by a moving proton at a perpendicular distance from the wire.

### Step 1: Magnetic Field Due to the Wire

The magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) around an infinitely long straight wire is given by Amp√®re's law:

\[
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\]

where:
- \( B \) is the magnitude of the magnetic field,
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A} \) (permeability of free space),
- \( I \) is the current through the wire,
- \( d \) is the perpendicular distance from the wire to the point where the field is being calculated.

The direction of \( \mathbf{B} \) can be determined using the right-hand rule: if you point your thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. At a point above the wire, this will result in \( \mathbf{B} \) pointing out of the plane (positive z-direction).

So, the vector form of \( \mathbf{B} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{B} = \left(0, 0, \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Magnetic Force on a Moving Proton

The force \( \mathbf{F} \) experienced by a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force law:

\[
\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
\]

where:
- \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (charge of a proton),
- \( \mathbf{v} = (0, -v, 0) \) is the velocity vector of the proton moving downward,
- \( \mathbf{B} = \left(0, 0, \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) \).

### Step 3: Cross Product Calculation

Calculate the cross product \( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \):

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
0 & -v & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\end{vmatrix}
= \mathbf{i} \left((-v) \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d} - 0 \right) - \mathbf{j} (0 - 0) + \mathbf{k} (0 - 0)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
= \left(-v \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) \mathbf{i}
\]

Thus, the force \( \mathbf{F} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{F} = q \left(-v \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) \mathbf{i} = -q v \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d} \mathbf{i}
\]

### Conclusion

The magnetic force on the proton is directed in the negative x-direction (to the left, if we assume rightward as positive x), with a magnitude:

\[
F = q v \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\]

This force acts perpendicular to both the velocity of the proton and the magnetic field direction.

Let's break down the physics problem involving the magnetic field generated by an infinitely long wire and its effect on a proton moving perpendicular above it.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Magnetic Field Due to a Long Wire:**
   - The expression for the magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) at a distance \( d \) from an infinitely long straight wire carrying current \( I \) is given by:
     \[
     B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
     \]
   - Here, \( \mu_0 \) (the permeability of free space) is approximately \( 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A} \).

2. **Direction of the Magnetic Field:**
   - Using the right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire, if the current flows to the right (along the x-axis), then at a point above the wire, the magnetic field points out of the page (in the positive z-direction).

3. **Magnetic Force on a Moving Proton:**
   - The force \( \mathbf{F} \) on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by:
     \[
     \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
     \]
   - For a proton (charge \( q = +1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)) moving with velocity \( \mathbf{v} \) downward (negative y-direction), the vectors are:
     \[
     \mathbf{v} = 0\mathbf{i} - v\mathbf{j} + 0\mathbf{k}
     \]
     \[
     \mathbf{B} = 0\mathbf{i} + 0\mathbf{j} + \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\mathbf{k}
     \]

4. **Cross Product Calculation:**
   - The cross product \( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \) is calculated using the determinant method:
     \[
     \mathbf{F} = q 
     \begin{vmatrix}
     \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
     0 & -v & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
     \end{vmatrix}
     \]
   - Expanding the determinant:
     - For \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \((-v) \cdot \left(\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) - 0 = -v \left(\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right)\)
     - For \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \(0 - 0 = 0\)
     - For \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \(0 - 0 = 0\)

5. **Resulting Force Vector:**
   - The resulting force is:
     \[
     \mathbf{F} = q \left(-v \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right)\mathbf{i}
     \]
   - Simplifying, the force on the proton is directed in the negative x-direction (to the left) with magnitude:
     \[
     F = q v \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
     \]

### Conclusion

The magnetic field from the wire exerts a force on the proton moving downward, causing it to experience a force to the left. This illustrates how magnetic fields can affect charged particles in motion, a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.
