It looks like you are working through some problems involving solving and understanding solutions to differential equations, particularly focusing on separable first-order differential equations and initial value problems (IVPs). Let's break down what you've done and clarify a few points:

### Problem 1: Solving with Explicit Solution

You started by considering the differential equation:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = x(\cos(y) + 5e^y) = 9x^2 - \sin(x). \]

To solve this, you separated variables:
\[ \frac{1}{\cos(y) + 5e^y} dy = (9x^2 - \sin(x)) dx. \]

You then integrated both sides:
- The left side became: \(\int \frac{1}{\cos(y) + 5e^y} dy\).
- The right side became: \(\int (9x^2 - \sin(x)) dx = 3x^3 + \cos(x) + C\).

You correctly noted that the left integral doesn't simplify to an elementary function, so \( y \) is implicitly defined in terms of \( x \).

### Initial Condition

Given the initial condition \( y(0) = \pi \), you substituted into your implicit solution:
\[ \sin(\pi) + 5e^\pi = 3(0)^3 + \cos(0) + C. \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 0 + 5e^\pi = 1 + C, \]
so \( C = 5e^\pi - 1 \).

### Specific Solution

Thus, the specific solution for this initial value problem is:
\[ \sin(y) + 5e^y = 3x^3 + \cos(x) + (5e^\pi - 1). \]

### Summary

You've correctly handled both the separation of variables and the application of the initial condition to find a specific solution. The key takeaway is that while \( y \) cannot be explicitly solved in terms of elementary functions, you can still express it implicitly as a function of \( x \).
