It looks like you are working through some problems involving solving and understanding solutions to differential equations, particularly focusing on separable first-order differential equations and initial value problems (IVPs). Let's break down what you've done and clarify a few points:

### Problem 1: Solving with Explicit Solution

You started by considering the differential equation:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = x(\cos(y) + 5e^y) = 9x^2 - \sin(x). \]

To solve this, you separated variables:
\[ \frac{1}{\cos(y) + 5e^y} dy = (9x^2 - \sin(x)) dx. \]

You then integrated both sides:
- The left side became: \(\int \frac{1}{\cos(y) + 5e^y} dy\).
- The right side became: \(\int (9x^2 - \sin(x)) dx = 3x^3 + \cos(x) + C\).

You correctly noted that the left integral doesn't simplify to an elementary function, so \( y \) is implicitly defined in terms of \( x \).

### Initial Condition

Given the initial condition \( y(0) = \pi \), you substituted into your implicit solution:
\[ \sin(\pi) + 5e^\pi = 3(0)^3 + \cos(0) + C. \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 0 + 5e^\pi = 1 + C, \]
so \( C = 5e^\pi - 1 \).

### Specific Solution

Thus, the specific solution for this initial value problem is:
\[ \sin(y) + 5e^y = 3x^3 + \cos(x) + (5e^\pi - 1). \]

### Summary

You've correctly handled both the separation of variables and the application of the initial condition to find a specific solution. The key takeaway is that while \( y \) cannot be explicitly solved in terms of elementary functions, you can still express it implicitly as a function of \( x \).

If there are any specific parts you'd like more clarification on or further problems to solve, feel free to ask!

Let's break down and analyze the steps involved in solving these types of problems involving differential equations.

### Problem 1: Solving a First-Order Differential Equation

You have a differential equation where \( y \) is explicitly expressed as a function of \( x \). The goal is to separate variables, integrate both sides, and then apply an initial condition to find a specific solution.

#### Steps:

1. **Separate Variables**: 
   - Rearrange the equation so that all terms involving \( y \) are on one side and all terms involving \( x \) are on the other.
   - Example: If you have \(\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)\), rearrange to \(\frac{1}{g(y)} dy = f(x) dx\).

2. **Integrate Both Sides**:
   - Integrate the separated equation with respect to its respective variables.
   - Example: \(\int \frac{1}{g(y)} dy = \int f(x) dx\).

3. **Apply Initial Conditions**:
   - Use the given initial condition, such as \( y(x_0) = y_0 \), to solve for the constant of integration.

4. **Solve for \( y \)** (if possible):
   - Try to express \( y \) explicitly in terms of \( x \).

### Problem 2: Solving an Implicit Differential Equation

In this scenario, you have a differential equation where \( y \) is implicitly expressed as a function of \( x \). The solution might not be straightforwardly solvable for \( y \), but you can still find a relationship between \( y \) and \( x \).

#### Steps:

1. **Separate Variables** (if possible):
   - Rearrange the equation to separate terms involving \( y \) from those involving \( x \).

2. **Integrate Both Sides**:
   - Integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables.

3. **Apply Initial Conditions**:
   - Use the initial condition to find the constant of integration.

4. **Express the Solution Implicitly**:
   - If you cannot solve explicitly for \( y \), leave the solution in implicit form.

### Example Analysis

#### Explicit Case:

Given: 
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y) \]

1. Separate variables:
   \[ \frac{1}{g(y)} dy = f(x) dx \]

2. Integrate both sides:
   \[ \int \frac{1}{g(y)} dy = \int f(x) dx \]

3. Apply initial condition \( y(x_0) = y_0 \):
   - Solve for the constant of integration.

4. Solve for \( y \) explicitly if possible.

#### Implicit Case:

Given:
\[ \sin(y) + 5e^y = 9x^2 - \sin(x) \]

1. Separate variables (if applicable):
   - In this case, it's already separated.

2. Integrate both sides:
   - The equation is already in an integrated form.

3. Apply initial condition \( y(0) = \pi \):
   - Substitute to find the constant of integration.

4. Express the solution implicitly:
   - The solution remains implicit: 
     \[ \sin(y) + 5e^y = 9x^2 - \sin(x) + C \]

### Conclusion

In both cases, the key steps are separating variables, integrating, and applying initial conditions to find specific solutions. Explicit solutions allow for direct expression of \( y \) in terms of \( x \), while implicit solutions provide a relationship between \( y \) and \( x \).
