The text describes conducting three common parametric statistical tests using SPSS software: the independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, and simple linear regression. 

1. **Independent Samples T-Test**: This test compares ages between two groups—patients with diabetes and those without—using a binary variable (yes/no). Results for both equal and unequal variances show no significant age difference based on diabetes status at an alpha level of 0.05.

2. **One-Way ANOVA**: This analysis examines the mean differences in "age" across various groups categorized by "grade." It yields a non-significant result (p-value = 0.736), indicating no significant age variation among different grades at an alpha level of 0.05.

3. **Simple Linear Regression**: A scatter plot explores the relationship between age and temperature, showing no clear correlation. The regression analysis also reports a non-significant p-value (0.468), suggesting no significant linear relationship between heart rate and age.

The text focuses on demonstrating how to perform these analyses in SPSS rather than discussing assumptions for parametric tests or comparing them with non-parametric alternatives.
