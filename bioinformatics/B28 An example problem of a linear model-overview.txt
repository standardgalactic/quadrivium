The text explains how to calculate the age of a fossil using carbon-14 dating, which relies on understanding radioactive decay. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,600 years, meaning it takes this time for its concentration to decrease by half in a specimen. The model used is exponential decay, represented mathematically as \( y(t) = y_0 \times e^{kt} \), where \( k \) is the decay constant.

To determine the age of a fossil with one-thousandth of the original carbon-14 concentration found in living tissue, we calculate using:

1. **Half-life calculation**: Knowing that after 5,600 years, the amount halves (\( y(5600) = \frac{y_0}{2} \)), we find \( k \) by setting up:
   \[
   \frac{y_0}{2} = y_0 \times e^{k \cdot 5600}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 5600k
   \]
   Solving gives \( k = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5600} \).

2. **Age calculation**: For a fossil with one-thousandth of the original concentration (\( y(t) = \frac{y_0}{1000} \)), we solve:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1000} = e^{kt}
   \]
   Taking natural logs:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{1000}\right) = kt
   \]
   Substitute \( k \):
   \[
   t = \frac{\ln(1000)}{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5600}}
   \]

3. **Result**: Calculating gives approximately 55,800 years for the fossil's age.

The text notes that carbon-14 dating is effective up to about 100,000 years due to diminishing concentrations over time, beyond which other isotopes with longer half-lives are used. This method helps establish Earth's age far beyond ancient estimations of a few thousand years.

The text explains how to determine the age of a fossil using the principles of radioactive decay, specifically focusing on carbon-14. The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,600 years, meaning that every 5,600 years, the concentration of carbon-14 in a sample decreases by half.

To find out how old a fossil is when its carbon-14 concentration is one-thousandth of what it was initially (as compared to living tissue), we use an exponential decay model. The decay process can be described mathematically with \( y(t) = y_0 \cdot e^{kt} \), where \( y(t) \) is the amount of carbon-14 at time \( t \), \( y_0 \) is the initial amount, and \( k \) is a constant determined by the half-life.

The calculation involves setting up an equation based on the fact that after 5,600 years (one half-life), the concentration will be half of its original value. From this, we derive that \( k = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5600} \).

When the fossil's carbon-14 level is one-thousandth of the initial amount, we solve for \( t \) using logarithms:

\[ \frac{1}{1000} = e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5600}t} \]

Taking natural logs on both sides and solving gives us \( t \approx 55,800 \) years. This indicates the fossil is about 55,800 years old.

The text notes that carbon-14 dating has limitations due to diminishing concentrations over long periods and the necessity for substantial specimen size. However, modern techniques can extend its accuracy up to around 100,000 years. For older specimens, other isotopes with longer half-lives are used. This method demonstrates Earth's ancient age, far beyond early estimates of a few thousand years.
