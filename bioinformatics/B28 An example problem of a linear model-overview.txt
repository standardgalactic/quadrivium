The text explains how to calculate the age of a fossil using carbon-14 dating, which relies on understanding radioactive decay. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,600 years, meaning it takes this time for its concentration to decrease by half in a specimen. The model used is exponential decay, represented mathematically as \( y(t) = y_0 \times e^{kt} \), where \( k \) is the decay constant.

To determine the age of a fossil with one-thousandth of the original carbon-14 concentration found in living tissue, we calculate using:

1. **Half-life calculation**: Knowing that after 5,600 years, the amount halves (\( y(5600) = \frac{y_0}{2} \)), we find \( k \) by setting up:
   \[
   \frac{y_0}{2} = y_0 \times e^{k \cdot 5600}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 5600k
   \]
   Solving gives \( k = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5600} \).

2. **Age calculation**: For a fossil with one-thousandth of the original concentration (\( y(t) = \frac{y_0}{1000} \)), we solve:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1000} = e^{kt}
   \]
   Taking natural logs:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{1000}\right) = kt
   \]
   Substitute \( k \):
   \[
   t = \frac{\ln(1000)}{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5600}}
   \]

3. **Result**: Calculating gives approximately 55,800 years for the fossil's age.

The text notes that carbon-14 dating is effective up to about 100,000 years due to diminishing concentrations over time, beyond which other isotopes with longer half-lives are used. This method helps establish Earth's age far beyond ancient estimations of a few thousand years.
