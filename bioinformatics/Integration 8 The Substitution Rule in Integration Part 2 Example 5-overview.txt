The task involves finding the indefinite integral of \((2x) / (x^2 + 1)^{-1/4}\) with respect to \(x\). To simplify this, we perform a substitution. Let \(u = x^2 + 1\), then the derivative \(du/dx = 2x\), which means \(du = 2x \, dx\). This allows us to rewrite the integral in terms of \(u\) as:

\[
\int u^{-1/4} \, du
\]

This integral can be solved by increasing the power by 1 and dividing by the new exponent:

\[
\int u^{-1/4} \, du = \frac{u^{3/4}}{3/4} + C = \frac{4}{3} u^{3/4} + C
\]

Substituting back for \(u\), we get:

\[
\frac{4}{3} (x^2 + 1)^{3/4} + C
\]

Thus, the indefinite integral of \((2x) / (x^2 + 1)^{-1/4}\) with respect to \(x\) is:

\[
\frac{4}{3} (x^2 + 1)^{3/4} + C
\]
