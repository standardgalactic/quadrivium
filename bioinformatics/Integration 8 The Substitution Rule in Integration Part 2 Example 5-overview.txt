The task involves finding the indefinite integral of \((2x) / (x^2 + 1)^{-1/4}\) with respect to \(x\). To simplify this, we perform a substitution. Let \(u = x^2 + 1\), then the derivative \(du/dx = 2x\), which means \(du = 2x \, dx\). This allows us to rewrite the integral in terms of \(u\) as:

\[
\int u^{-1/4} \, du
\]

This integral can be solved by increasing the power by 1 and dividing by the new exponent:

\[
\int u^{-1/4} \, du = \frac{u^{3/4}}{3/4} + C = \frac{4}{3} u^{3/4} + C
\]

Substituting back for \(u\), we get:

\[
\frac{4}{3} (x^2 + 1)^{3/4} + C
\]

Thus, the indefinite integral of \((2x) / (x^2 + 1)^{-1/4}\) with respect to \(x\) is:

\[
\frac{4}{3} (x^2 + 1)^{3/4} + C
\]

The text explains how to find the indefinite integral of the function \( \frac{2x}{(x^2 + 1)^{-\frac{1}{4}}} \) with respect to \( x \). To simplify this, we use substitution:

1. Let \( u = x^2 + 1 \).
2. The derivative \( du/dx = 2x \), so \( du = 2x \, dx \).

Substituting these into the integral transforms it into \( \int u^{-\frac{1}{4}} \, du \). This can be integrated as follows:

- Increase the exponent by 1: \(-\frac{1}{4} + 1 = \frac{3}{4}\).
- Integrate to get \( \frac{u^{\frac{3}{4}}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{4}{3} u^{\frac{3}{4}} \).

Since this is an indefinite integral, we add the constant of integration \( C \). Finally, substitute back \( u = x^2 + 1 \) to obtain:

\[ \frac{4}{3} (x^2 + 1)^{\frac{3}{4}} + C. \]
