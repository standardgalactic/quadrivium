This message to Krista King. I hope I'm pronouncing it correctly. I'm Jean. I'm a Special Surgeon
here in South Africa. I think what you might call in America an attending, which I've been
for 10 years and I've finally organized my life so much that I can get to my true passion,
which is physics and maths. Now, I do study these on my own from, you know, through textbooks
and from time to time obviously you get stuck a bit. And what I want to say is this is a
massive big thank you because whenever I do get stuck there's one place that I do go
for some answers and that's the videos that you've put up on YouTube. I think they're fantastic
and I like the personal way in which you're trying to convey this. I'm sure there are many
thousands of people who send you this sort of messages. I'll see the thousands that view
your videos but in the end you deserve it. Thank you very much for those videos and I'll
call Sydney as I go towards the more difficult parts of the textbooks and start viewing your
videos more and more. Thank you.
