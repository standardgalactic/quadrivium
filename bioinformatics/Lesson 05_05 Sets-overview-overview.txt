The text provides an overview of basic set operations using arrays in Julia, focusing on union, intersection, difference, subsets, and set notation. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Union**: Combines elements from two arrays without duplicates.
2. **Intersection**: Identifies common elements between two arrays.
3. **Difference**: Removes elements present in the second array from the first.
4. **Subsets**: Checks if all elements of one array exist within another.
5. **Set Notation in Julia**: Uses the `set` function to remove duplicates, ensuring each element appears only once.

The text concludes by mentioning that future content will cover multisets, which handle multiple occurrences differently from sets and arrays.
