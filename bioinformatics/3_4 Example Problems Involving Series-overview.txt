The text discusses the convergence of an infinite series expressed as \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{k(k+2)}\). It explores whether the series converges and, if so, to what value. The author uses several methods to analyze this:

1. **Limit Comparison Test (Kth Test)**: Initially, a transformation of variables from \(k\) to \(n\) is used for clarity. By applying the limit comparison test, it's established that \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{4}{k(k+2)} = 0\), indicating potential convergence.

2. **Partial Fractions Decomposition**: The series is decomposed into partial fractions:
   \[
   \frac{4}{k(k+2)} = \frac{2}{k} - \frac{2}{k+2}
   \]
   This decomposition helps in expressing the series as a telescoping series.

3. **Telescoping Series**: The series is rewritten and examined term by term:
   \[
   S_n = \left(2 - \frac{2}{3}\right) + \left(1 - \frac{2}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{5}\right) + \ldots + \left(\frac{2}{n} - \frac{2}{n+2}\right)
   \]
   Many intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:
   \[
   S_n = 2 + 1 - \frac{2}{n+1} - \frac{2}{n+2}
   \]

4. **Convergence Analysis**: As \(n\) approaches infinity, the remaining terms \(-\frac{2}{n+1}\) and \(-\frac{2}{n+2}\) approach zero. Thus, the series converges to:
   \[
   S = 3
   \]

In conclusion, the infinite series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{k(k+2)}\) converges to 3, as shown through partial fraction decomposition and the telescoping nature of the series.

The text describes a process of simplifying a series by adding terms that cancel each other out. It involves alternating positive and negative fractions: \(-\frac{1}{2}\), \(+\frac{1}{2}\), \(-\frac{2}{5}\), and \(+\frac{2}{5}\). As more terms are added, pairs of terms continue to cancel each other. The partial sum simplifies to a constant 3 minus a fraction that diminishes as the number of terms increases. Taking the limit as \(n\) approaches infinity results in the diminishing term becoming zero, leaving a final value of 3. Thus, the series converges to 3.
