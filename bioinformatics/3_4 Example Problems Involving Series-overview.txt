The text discusses the convergence of an infinite series expressed as \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{k(k+2)}\). It explores whether the series converges and, if so, to what value. The author uses several methods to analyze this:

1. **Limit Comparison Test (Kth Test)**: Initially, a transformation of variables from \(k\) to \(n\) is used for clarity. By applying the limit comparison test, it's established that \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{4}{k(k+2)} = 0\), indicating potential convergence.

2. **Partial Fractions Decomposition**: The series is decomposed into partial fractions:
   \[
   \frac{4}{k(k+2)} = \frac{2}{k} - \frac{2}{k+2}
   \]
   This decomposition helps in expressing the series as a telescoping series.

3. **Telescoping Series**: The series is rewritten and examined term by term:
   \[
   S_n = \left(2 - \frac{2}{3}\right) + \left(1 - \frac{2}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{5}\right) + \ldots + \left(\frac{2}{n} - \frac{2}{n+2}\right)
   \]
   Many intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:
   \[
   S_n = 2 + 1 - \frac{2}{n+1} - \frac{2}{n+2}
   \]

4. **Convergence Analysis**: As \(n\) approaches infinity, the remaining terms \(-\frac{2}{n+1}\) and \(-\frac{2}{n+2}\) approach zero. Thus, the series converges to:
   \[
   S = 3
   \]

In conclusion, the infinite series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{k(k+2)}\) converges to 3, as shown through partial fraction decomposition and the telescoping nature of the series.

The text describes a process of simplifying a series by adding terms that cancel each other out. It involves alternating positive and negative fractions: \(-\frac{1}{2}\), \(+\frac{1}{2}\), \(-\frac{2}{5}\), and \(+\frac{2}{5}\). As more terms are added, pairs of terms continue to cancel each other. The partial sum simplifies to a constant 3 minus a fraction that diminishes as the number of terms increases. Taking the limit as \(n\) approaches infinity results in the diminishing term becoming zero, leaving a final value of 3. Thus, the series converges to 3.

The text discusses determining whether the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{k(k+2)}\) converges and if so, to what value. The author uses several techniques to explore this:

1. **Limit Test (kth Test):** 
   - They begin by applying a test for convergence involving the limit of the terms as \( k \) approaches infinity. This involves rewriting the sequence as \(\frac{4}{k(k+2)}\) and taking the limit, which results in 0. Thus, this indicates potential convergence, but it doesn't confirm it.

2. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**
   - The series is decomposed into partial fractions: 
     \[
     \frac{4}{k(k+2)} = \frac{2}{k} - \frac{2}{k+2}
     \]
   - This decomposition simplifies the process of examining convergence by breaking down the terms.

3. **Telescoping Series Method:**
   - By writing out several initial terms and observing patterns, a telescoping series is identified:
     \[
     \left(\frac{2}{1} - \frac{2}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{2} - \frac{2}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{5}\right) + \cdots
     \]
   - Many terms cancel out, leaving only the first few and the last few in the partial sums.

4. **Summation of Partial Sums:**
   - For a general term \( n \), the partial sum becomes:
     \[
     2\left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{2}{n+1} - \frac{2}{n+2}
     \]
   - As \( n \to \infty \), the terms \(-\frac{2}{n+1}\) and \(-\frac{2}{n+2}\) approach zero.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The series converges, and the sum approaches:
     \[
     2 + 1 = 3
     \]

Overall, through partial fraction decomposition and recognizing a telescoping pattern, it is determined that the series converges to 3.

The text discusses a series where terms are added and simplified. By pairing positive and negative terms, many cancel out, leaving behind \(3 - \frac{2}{n+2}\) as the partial sum after simplification. As \(n\) approaches infinity, the term \(-\frac{2}{n+2}\) tends to zero, resulting in a limit of 3 for the series. Therefore, the series converges to 3. The speaker emphasizes that this convergence is straightforward and highlights it graphically or conceptually without moving left or right on an axis, but rather staying focused at the point of convergence: 3.
