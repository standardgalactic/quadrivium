The text discusses finding a solution to a differential equation problem involving trigonometric functions. It explains that there is an \( x^0 \) term, which implies that \( n = 1 \). The parameters are given as \( \alpha = -1 \) and \( \beta = 2 \).

When writing out the solution, it involves calculating:

- \( d^2 \), 
- \( -2\alpha d \) (which becomes \( +2d \) since \(\alpha = -1\)),
- \( \alpha^2 + \beta^2 \) which equals 5.

The differential equation is expressed as:

\[ d^2 - 2\alpha d + (\alpha^2 + \beta^2) = 0 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ d^2 + 2d + 5 = 0 \]

The text emphasizes that the annihilating operator, which removes both cosine and sine terms, works regardless of whether they are mixed. This operator is effective for functions raised to any power \( n \), where \( x^0 \) implies \( n-1 = 0 \), thus confirming \( n = 1 \). The solution involves using this annihilating operator to simplify the equation.
