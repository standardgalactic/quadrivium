The text discusses finding a solution to a differential equation problem involving trigonometric functions. It explains that there is an \( x^0 \) term, which implies that \( n = 1 \). The parameters are given as \( \alpha = -1 \) and \( \beta = 2 \).

When writing out the solution, it involves calculating:

- \( d^2 \), 
- \( -2\alpha d \) (which becomes \( +2d \) since \(\alpha = -1\)),
- \( \alpha^2 + \beta^2 \) which equals 5.

The differential equation is expressed as:

\[ d^2 - 2\alpha d + (\alpha^2 + \beta^2) = 0 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ d^2 + 2d + 5 = 0 \]

The text emphasizes that the annihilating operator, which removes both cosine and sine terms, works regardless of whether they are mixed. This operator is effective for functions raised to any power \( n \), where \( x^0 \) implies \( n-1 = 0 \), thus confirming \( n = 1 \). The solution involves using this annihilating operator to simplify the equation.

The text discusses a mathematical problem involving differential operators used to find solutions to equations. The key points are:

1. **Equation Setup**: The problem involves an equation with \( x^0 \), implying \( n = 1 \).

2. **Parameters**: It specifies that \( \alpha = -1 \) and \( \beta = 2 \).

3. **Solution Structure**: The solution is expressed in terms of a differential operator: 
   \[
   d^2 - 2\alpha d + (\alpha^2 + \beta^2)
   \]
   Substituting the values, this becomes:
   \[
   d^2 + 2d + 5
   \]

4. **Annihilating Operator**: This operator is used to eliminate terms involving cosine and sine functions, regardless of their combination.

5. **General Applicability**: The operator works for any function \( x^n \), where \( n-1 = 0 \) implies \( n = 1 \).

The discussion highlights how the differential operator effectively handles both cosine and sine components in the solution process.
