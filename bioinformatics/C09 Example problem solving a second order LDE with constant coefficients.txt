Good, so let's get a few simple problems done.
In the first one we have here, it's an ordinary differential equation, not a partial differential equation.
It's in linear form because I don't have squares here or cubes or whatever as far as my dependent variable is concerned.
And it's second order and it's linear and homogeneous.
Okay, so I can immediately write my auxiliary equation and remember that was am squared plus bm plus c equals zero.
If I just get my highlighter out and I'm going to mark it in green as usual because that is something that you should know.
And through that equation that's going to be 2m squared, a equals 2, and minus, b is negative 5, minus 5m, and negative 3 equals 0.
I just want to see that I wrote the problem, yeah, I wrote the problem correctly.
Okay, now if you can't just get the roots of this, remember we can always use the fact that m is going to be minus b plus minus square root of b squared minus 4ac over 2a.
So now we solve these binomial equations, something you should also know, so let's have a look.
We're going to have m equals negative negative 5 plus and minus b squared, negative 5 times negative 5 is 25, minus 4 times 2 times negative 3.
2 and negative 3, so that looks like it's going to give me 49, 4 times 2 is 8, 8 times 2 is 24, that's going to be a positive 24, 25 plus 24 is 29, 49 square root of 49 is 7.
And anyway, 8 times 2 times 8 which is 2, so m sub 1 is going to be 5 plus 7 over 4,
and m sub 2 is going to be this 5 minus square root of 49, which is 7, divided by 2 times 2 is 4, so m sub 1 is going to be 12 divided by 4, which is 3.
m sub 2 is going to be negative 2 over 4, which is negative 1 half.
As simple as that, you could also just have, it's got the roots directly there.
So we're going to have the fact that the general solution is going to be y equals c.
c sub 1 e to the power 3x plus c sub 2 e to the power negative 1 half x.
Simply from remembering the fact that we're going to have y equals c1 e to the power m sub 1 x plus c2 e to the power m sub 2 x,
which is what you should also remember.
And we have, this is one of the three possibilities, because the square root of b squared minus 4, or b squared minus 4 ac was larger than 0,
and in this case it was 49, and certainly 49 is greater than 0, as far as b squared minus 4 ac is concerned.
I hope you saw it at the bottom there, sorry, this, this, apologies, this is y equals c sub 1 e to the power m1 x plus c sub 2 e to the power m sub 2 x,
purely because our b squared minus 4 ac was larger than 0.
So...
iscu B squared minus 5 ac was cancelled as the power m1 x 2 x 1 up to the power m1 16,
iscu B squared minus 5 ac was larger than 0.
So yeah basically everybody will get to the power m1 fields that were hovered and effortless.
Buy a shortwave verses 0 for 1 x plus the force 1 into the power m0 15,
that is absolutely promising, so I think they will do better looks more large than that
I guess it's about the same population, so that's the problem to choose enough.
So now we don't see the current income, which is like anì¢… qualquer monkey that costs a steady loader.
