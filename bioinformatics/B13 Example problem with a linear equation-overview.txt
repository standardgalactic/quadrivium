The text introduces the concept of non-elementary integrals, specifically focusing on two important functions: the error function (erf) and the complementary error function. These functions arise because some indefinite integrals, like those involving \( e^{-x^2} \) or \( \sin(x^2) \), cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

The error function is defined as:

\[
\text{erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt
\]

The complementary error function is defined as:

\[
\text{erfc}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt
\]

An important property of these functions is that the sum of the error function and the complementary error function equals 1 for any \( x \):

\[
\text{erf}(x) + \text{erfc}(x) = 1
\]

Additionally, when evaluating the error function at infinity:

\[
\text{erf}(\infty) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt = 1
\]

This is derived from the fact that:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

These functions are significant in applied mathematics, particularly in probability and statistics. Understanding their definitions and properties is essential for solving related problems.

The text introduces the concepts of the error function (\(\text{erf}(x)\)) and the complementary error function (\(\text{erfc}(x)\)), which are important in fields like probability and statistics. These functions arise from non-elementary integrals, specifically those involving \(e^{-t^2}\), which cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

The error function is defined as:

\[
\text{erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt
\]

The complementary error function is defined as:

\[
\text{erfc}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt
\]

A key property of these functions is that \(\text{erf}(x) + \text{erfc}(x) = 1\) for all \(x\). Additionally, as \(x\) approaches infinity, \(\text{erf}(x)\) approaches 1. This can be shown by evaluating the integral from 0 to infinity:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

Thus, \(\text{erf}(\infty) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} = 1\).

The text emphasizes the importance of memorizing these functions and understanding their properties for use in various applications.
