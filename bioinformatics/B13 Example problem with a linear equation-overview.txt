The text introduces the concept of non-elementary integrals, specifically focusing on two important functions: the error function (erf) and the complementary error function. These functions arise because some indefinite integrals, like those involving \( e^{-x^2} \) or \( \sin(x^2) \), cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

The error function is defined as:

\[
\text{erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt
\]

The complementary error function is defined as:

\[
\text{erfc}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt
\]

An important property of these functions is that the sum of the error function and the complementary error function equals 1 for any \( x \):

\[
\text{erf}(x) + \text{erfc}(x) = 1
\]

Additionally, when evaluating the error function at infinity:

\[
\text{erf}(\infty) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt = 1
\]

This is derived from the fact that:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

These functions are significant in applied mathematics, particularly in probability and statistics. Understanding their definitions and properties is essential for solving related problems.
