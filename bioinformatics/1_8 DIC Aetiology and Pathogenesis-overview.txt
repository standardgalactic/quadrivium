The text provides an overview of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), describing it as a systemic condition characterized by both thrombosis and hemorrhage. DIC is also known as consumption coagulopathy or defibrination syndrome, resulting from the exposure of blood to pro-coagulant factors like tissue factor or cancer pro-coagulant. This leads to fibrin formation in circulation, breakdown of fibrin, depletion of clotting factors, hemorrhage, and organ damage.

Key points include:
- **Pathogenesis**: Involves uncontrolled production of thrombin leading to intravascular fibrin deposition. Normally localized clotting is controlled by antithrombin and tissue factor pathway inhibitors, but in DIC, these controls are overwhelmed.
- **Etiology**: Massive activation of the coagulation cascade can result from release of tissue thromboplastins, vascular endothelium injury, or expression of tissue factor due to endotoxins and cytokines. Fibrin degradation byproducts also interfere with clotting processes.

There are two forms:
1. **Chronic compensated DIC**: The liver and bone marrow compensate for coagulation issues, leading primarily to thrombotic states (e.g., Trousseau's syndrome in malignancy).
2. **Acute decompensated DIC**: Characterized by systemic diastasis and bleeding, including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia due to mechanical shear of red blood cells.

DIC should not be confused with other conditions like thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome, which are primarily related to platelet activation.

Causes of DIC include sepsis, trauma, malignancies, and obstetric complications. Sepsis is a common cause across various infections. Trauma and surgery can trigger DIC in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), leading to multi-organ dysfunction. Malignancy itself creates a hypercoagulable state, with conditions like leukemia causing hemorrhage and solid tumors causing thrombosis.

Other causes include peritoneovenous shunts allowing endotoxins into circulation, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, envenomation by certain snakes, cirrhosis, heat stroke, amphetamine overdose, and purpura fulminans due to protein C deficiency. Management involves supportive care with platelet transfusions, clotting factor replacement, and heparin use, while prognosis depends on the underlying cause.
