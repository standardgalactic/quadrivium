So we left things off by wanting now to show that we have this equivalence class on G containing A.
So there's some element A in the set that makes up the group and we define it by this equivalence relation
such that if I have A and B elements of my set G that I have A inverse composed with B
that A inverse composed with B that will be an element of H.
And I want to show that this set is the same as this set with A, this composition with H
such that H is an element of my subgroup, that these two are equivalent.
And I said if I want to show that two sets are equivalent I've got to show that this is a subset of that
and that that is a subset of that.
So in our proof first let's show that this is indeed a subset of A composed with H
such that H is an element of my subgroup.
Let's show that that is so.
Now first of all let's just choose an element in this equivalence class
and we'll just say let X be an element of this equivalence class, this equivalence set
and if that is so it does mean that X inverse composed with A must be an element of this.
And let's say then it's an element of this.
And I'm just going to say that by the symmetric property
because we've shown that it is an equivalence class
I also have to have A inverse X being an element of that.
And I've defined it such that remember that
this relation at the moment I'm dealing with that left relation
is such that if I created two of these
it must be an element of H
it must be an element of H
let's choose an arbitrary element in H
so that is going to let's say equal H
an element of H
quite legitimate to do because that is how I defined my equivalence relation.
And because H is a group
A inverse is in that group
that means it's inverse which is this A must also be in that group
so I would have A inverse A
X equals A
should have put that one there
so put this
if that's an element this must be an element
left multiply it or addition
whatever this binary operation is
on that side this gives me
this by the associative law
this gives me the identity element
so I'm showing X is equal to A H
which is an element of H
and that will only happen
if X is then an element of this
if X is in there
so I've just shown now
that if X is in this equivalence class
it is a subset of that
X is a subset then of this side
in other words X must be in this
when it's in there it must be a subset of there
so I've shown it in this direction
so that's quite easy to do
let's just look at this side
where I have my set such that H is an element of H
I must now show that this is a subset of the equivalence class on that
once again I'm going to choose an X
let's X be an element of this set
a H such as H is an element of H
and if it is an element of that
if it is an element of that
I can just say
choose it to be one of those
choose it to be one of those
if I multiply on the left
or binary operation on the left with X
that is going to equal H
which is an element of H
if I've shown it in this way
it means it's an equivalence relation
that is how I defined my equivalence relation
in other words
what I have here
what I've shown here is
this is the same as this equivalence relation that we had
and if that is so
it means it must be a subset
it must be inside of
it must be inside of A as well
so I've shown this way around as well
that this must be a subset of that
and if I've shown both of these
I have shown both of those being a subset
it means these two are equal to each other
and remember this is the left
I've just shown the left coset here
and I must also again
you can look at that yourself
if you turn all of these around
show that the right coset exists as well
so this would be the left coset
on H
and this would be the right coset
so not a difficult proof to show
that one is indeed a subset of another
and this turns out also to be very important
as we will move eventually to Lagrange's theorem
