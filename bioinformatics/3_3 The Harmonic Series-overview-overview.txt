The text analyzes the harmonic series \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} \) to determine its convergence or divergence. Although individual terms of the series approach zero as \( k \) increases, this alone does not guarantee convergence. To assess the series' behavior, the author compares it with an integral.

The comparison involves considering the partial sums of the harmonic series and comparing them to the area under the curve \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \). Specifically, by calculating the integral \( \int_1^{n+1} \frac{1}{x} \, dx \), which equals \( \ln(n+1) \), it is shown that this value serves as a lower bound for the series' partial sums. Since \( \ln(n+1) \) grows without bound as \( n \) increases, it indicates that the harmonic series diverges.

Thus, despite each term tending towards zero, the series itself diverges because its partial sums continue to grow indefinitely. This conclusion is supported by comparing the sum of the rectangles under the curve \( y = \frac{1}{x} \) with the natural logarithm, revealing that the series overestimates the area and therefore has an infinite limit.
