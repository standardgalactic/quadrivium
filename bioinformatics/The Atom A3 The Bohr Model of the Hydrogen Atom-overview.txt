The passage provides an explanation of Niels Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, which was pivotal in understanding atomic structure and spectral lines. Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts:

1. **Bohr Model Overview**: 
   - Niels Bohr proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific stable orbits without radiating energy.
   - Electrons can jump between these orbits by absorbing or emitting photons with energy equal to the difference between the initial and final orbit energies.

2. **Quantization of Angular Momentum**:
   - Bohr introduced the idea that the angular momentum of an electron in orbit is quantized. This means it can only take on certain discrete values.
   - The quantization condition was expressed as \( mvr = n\frac{h}{2\pi} \) (where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the electron, \( v \) is its velocity, and \( r \) is the radius of the orbit). This condition ensures that only specific orbits are allowed.

3. **Energy Levels**:
   - Bohr derived an expression for the energy levels of electrons in a hydrogen atom.
   - The energy of an electron in the nth orbit is given by \( E_n = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2} \), where 13.6 eV is the ionization energy for hydrogen (the energy required to remove the electron from the ground state, n=1).

4. **Radius of Orbits**:
   - Bohr calculated the radius of these orbits using his quantization condition and Coulomb's law.
   - The radius \( r_n \) of an orbit is proportional to \( n^2 \), specifically given by \( r_n = a_0 n^2 \) where \( a_0 \) (Bohr radius) is approximately 0.529 Å.

5. **Implications**:
   - Bohr's model successfully explained the spectral lines of hydrogen, particularly the Balmer series.
   - It showed that electrons in atoms occupy specific energy levels and can transition between these levels by absorbing or emitting photons with energies matching the differences between these levels.

Bohr’s model was a significant step forward from previous atomic models, providing a theoretical framework for understanding atomic spectra. However, it has limitations and is superseded by quantum mechanics, which provides a more comprehensive description of atomic structure.
