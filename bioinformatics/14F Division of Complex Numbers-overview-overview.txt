The text outlines techniques for simplifying operations with complex numbers by leveraging their conjugates, particularly focusing on division:

1. **Properties of Conjugates**:
   - The conjugate of a sum or product follows distributive rules: \((z_1 + z_2)^* = z_1^* + z_2^*\) and \((z_1 \cdot z_2)^* = z_1^* \cdot z_2^*\).
   - The conjugate of a quotient is the quotient of conjugates: \(\left(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right)^* = \frac{z_1^*}{z_2^*}\), given \(z_2 \neq 0\).
   - Taking the conjugate twice returns the original number: \((z^*)^* = z\).

2. **Examples**:
   - Calculating reciprocals of complex numbers by multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator to simplify.
   - For instance, \( \frac{1}{i} = -i \) and for \( z = 1 - 5i \), \( \frac{1}{1-5i} = \frac{1}{26}(1 + 5i)\).

3. **Dividing Complex Numbers**:
   - To divide complex numbers, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
   - Example: Dividing \( i \) by \( 1 + i \) yields \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i\).

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Use conjugates to simplify division without expanding denominators unnecessarily, recognizing patterns or rewriting expressions.

The text emphasizes practical methods for managing complex number operations, particularly focusing on using conjugates to facilitate simpler calculations, especially in divisions. It highlights examples and strategies to avoid extensive computation by applying the properties of conjugates effectively.
