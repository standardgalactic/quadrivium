The text explains how sign conventions in optics are used to determine the nature and characteristics of images formed by mirrors, focusing on distinguishing between convex and concave mirrors:

- **Concave Mirrors**: 
  - Radius of curvature (\( R \)) is negative.
  - Example: With a focal length (\( F \)) of 12 cm, \( R = -24 \) cm. An object placed between the focal point and the mirror forms a real, inverted, and magnified image.

- **Convex Mirrors**: 
  - Radius of curvature (\( R \)) is positive.
  - Example: With \( R = 0.20 \) m, the focal length is negative, resulting in virtual, upright, diminished images located behind the mirror.

The text emphasizes that adhering to these sign conventions simplifies calculations and understanding of image properties such as orientation, type, magnification (\( M \)), and position (\( S_i \)). While not all textbooks use these conventions, they provide a consistent method for determining optical system characteristics, reducing confusion.
