The text presents a problem involving two incident light rays with the same amplitude and wavelength (400 nanometers) entering different mediums, resulting in a phase difference of 5.65 radiance upon exiting. To understand this phase difference in terms of wavelengths, it's noted that one wavelength corresponds to \(2\pi\) radians or radiances. Thus, the phase difference is converted to approximately 0.8992 wavelengths.

To find the minimum length (\(L\)) required for this phase difference, the relationship between \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) (refractive indices) is used:
\[ L = \frac{0.8992 \times 400}{N_1 - N_2} \]
Given that \(N_1 - N_2 = 0.1\), the minimum length (\(L\)) is calculated to be 360 nanometers.

Additionally, a second scenario involves comparing paths through blocks of plastic with varying refractive indices. The task is to determine which path results in light exiting faster, interpreted as having the shortest time traveled. This requires calculating the total travel time for each path using:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Velocity}} = \frac{\text{Distance} \times N}{C} \]
where \(N\) is the refractive index and \(C\) is the speed of light. By comparing these times, one can determine which path results in faster travel through differences in refractive indices.

Overall, the text combines concepts from wave optics, such as phase difference and wavelength units, with principles from classical mechanics related to velocity and time, particularly focusing on how varying refractive indices affect light's speed in different media.
