The text presents a problem involving two incident light rays with the same amplitude and wavelength (400 nanometers) entering different mediums, resulting in a phase difference of 5.65 radiance upon exiting. To understand this phase difference in terms of wavelengths, it's noted that one wavelength corresponds to \(2\pi\) radians or radiances. Thus, the phase difference is converted to approximately 0.8992 wavelengths.

To find the minimum length (\(L\)) required for this phase difference, the relationship between \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) (refractive indices) is used:
\[ L = \frac{0.8992 \times 400}{N_1 - N_2} \]
Given that \(N_1 - N_2 = 0.1\), the minimum length (\(L\)) is calculated to be 360 nanometers.

Additionally, a second scenario involves comparing paths through blocks of plastic with varying refractive indices. The task is to determine which path results in light exiting faster, interpreted as having the shortest time traveled. This requires calculating the total travel time for each path using:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Velocity}} = \frac{\text{Distance} \times N}{C} \]
where \(N\) is the refractive index and \(C\) is the speed of light. By comparing these times, one can determine which path results in faster travel through differences in refractive indices.

Overall, the text combines concepts from wave optics, such as phase difference and wavelength units, with principles from classical mechanics related to velocity and time, particularly focusing on how varying refractive indices affect light's speed in different media.

The text discusses two physics problems related to light waves, focusing on the concepts of wavelength, phase difference, and speed of light through different mediums with varying refractive indices.

1. **Phase Difference Problem:**
   - Two light rays with a wavelength of 400 nanometers are in phase as they enter different media.
   - After passing through these media, they have a phase difference of 5.65 radiance units.
   - The task is to convert this phase difference from radiance to wavelengths using the relationship that one wavelength equals \(2\pi\) radians (or radiance).
   - This conversion results in approximately 0.8992 wavelengths.
   - To find the minimum length \(L\) that produces this phase difference, use the formula:
     \[
     L = \frac{0.8992 \times 400 \text{ nm}}{N1 - N2}
     \]
   - With \(N1 - N2 = 0.1\), the calculated minimum length \(L\) is approximately 360 nanometers.

2. **Time and Speed Problem:**
   - The second problem involves two paths through a block of plastic with different refractive indices (N1 to N7) for each section.
   - Light travels along these paths, and the task is to determine which path results in faster travel time.
   - Using the relationship between speed \(V\), refractive index \(N\), and speed of light in a vacuum \(C\) (\(V = \frac{C}{N}\)), calculate the total travel time for each path.
   - Path A has a length of 4L with sections having indices N1 to N4, while path B has a length of 2L with indices N5 and N6, plus an additional section with index N7.
   - Calculate the travel times \(T_A\) and \(T_B\) for each path:
     \[
     T_A = \frac{L}{C} (N1 + N2 + N3 + N4)
     \]
     \[
     T_B = \frac{L}{C} (2N5 + N6 + N7)
     \]
   - The path with the shorter total travel time is faster.

These problems illustrate fundamental principles in optics, including phase differences and how light speed varies through materials with different refractive indices.
