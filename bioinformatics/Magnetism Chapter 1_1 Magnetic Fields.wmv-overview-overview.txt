This introduction to a video series on magnetism focuses on defining and understanding the magnetic field. Here’s a summary of its key points:

1. **Magnetic Field Definition**: Unlike electric fields based on point charges, magnetic fields are defined through moving charges or as intrinsic properties of particles since no magnetic monopole has been discovered.

2. **Origins of Magnetic Fields**: These arise from moving charges or the inherent characteristics of charged particles that also possess electric fields.

3. **Force Equation**: The force on a charge in a magnetic field is calculated using \( F = Q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) \), where the force is perpendicular to both velocity and magnetic field, with direction determined by the right-hand rule.

4. **Right-Hand Rule**: For positive charges, align your fingers with velocity and curl towards the magnetic field; your thumb indicates the force's direction. For negative charges (e.g., electrons), the force is opposite the thumb’s direction.

5. **Example Problem**: An example involves calculating the deflecting magnetic force on a proton moving in a uniform magnetic field using its kinetic energy to find velocity, then applying the force formula.

6. **Units of Tesla**: The series explains how Tesla units are derived from the basic equation for magnetic force.

7. **Vector Considerations**: Magnetic field problems often require vector calculations due to directional dependencies. No force acts on charges moving parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field; only direction changes, not speed.

The series will delve into more complex vector-based problems in future videos.
