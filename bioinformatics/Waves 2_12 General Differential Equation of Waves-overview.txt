The text describes solving a generalized wave equation problem by using a differential approach to find the velocity of a wave. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: 
   - You're given a wave described by an equation involving displacement \( y \) as a function of position \( x \) and time \( t \).
   - The displacement is expressed in terms of constants (\( y_m \), \( a \), \( b \)) and a function \( h \) dependent on both \( x \) and \( t \).

2. **Wave Equation**:
   - The wave velocity \( v \) is determined using the general differential equation:  
     \[
     v = \sqrt{\frac{d^2 y / dt^2}{d^2 y / dx^2}}
     \]
   - This formula requires taking partial derivatives of the displacement function.

3. **Phase Function**:
   - A phase term \( \epsilon = ax + bt \) is introduced to simplify derivative calculations.
   - First and second derivatives with respect to time and position are calculated using this phase.

4. **Calculations**:
   - The first derivative of \( y \) with respect to time involves the function \( h'(\epsilon) \), resulting in a term proportional to \( cb^{-1} \).
   - Similarly, the second derivative terms lead to expressions involving \( cb^2 \) and \( ca^2 \).

5. **Velocity**:
   - Substituting these derivatives into the wave equation yields the velocity \( v = b/a \), aligning with known relationships between frequency, wavelength (\( \lambda \)), and angular parameters (\(\omega\) and \(k\)).

6. **Generalization**:
   - The method works for any function \( h \) as long as it depends linearly on \( x \) and \( t \).
   - This shows the versatility of the approach, applicable to various wave forms like sine or cosine functions.

The text emphasizes how elegantly this mathematical framework simplifies finding wave velocity using calculus, regardless of the specific form of function \( h \), provided it adheres to linearity in terms of \( x \) and \( t \).
