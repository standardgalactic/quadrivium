The text discusses various methods for approximating the area under a curve using Riemann sums:

1. **Left Riemann Sums (Lower Sums):** Typically, this method uses the function's value at the left endpoint of each subinterval to determine rectangle heights. However, the text mistakenly describes using right endpoints instead. Generally, left Riemann sums tend to underestimate the area.

2. **Right Riemann Sums:** This approach involves using the function's value at the right endpoint of each subinterval for the height of the rectangles. The text illustrates this with an example where a rectangle's height is calculated as \( f(1) = 0 \), which can also lead to underestimation.

3. **Midpoint Sums:** Mentioned briefly, midpoint sums involve using the function's value at the midpoint of each subinterval, potentially offering more accuracy than other methods, though specifics are not provided in the text.

The key takeaway is that increasing the number of rectangles (or decreasing \( \Delta x \)) improves the approximation's accuracy. The ideal scenario involves an infinite number of rectangles to precisely calculate the integral's true value.
