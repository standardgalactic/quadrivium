The presentation offers a comprehensive overview of obstructive jaundice, highlighting its significance in medical exams and clinical practice. Obstructive jaundice arises from blockages in bile flow into the duodenum, causing symptoms such as skin and eye yellowing (jaundice), dark urine, and pale stools.

Key causes include:

1. **Choledocolithiasis**: Stones blocking bile ducts, often linked with cholangitis.
2. **Biliary Tract Tumors**: Such as cholangiocarcinomas.
3. **Extrinsic Compression**: From conditions like lymphoma compressing the bile duct.
4. **Parasitic Infections**: Mainly Ascaris causing obstruction.
5. **HIV Cholangiopathy**: Due to HIV, cytomegalovirus, or cryptosporidium.
6. **Lymphomas**: Occasionally leading to jaundice through bile duct compression.
7. **Choledochal Cysts and Pancreatitis**: Both acute and chronic pancreatitis can cause obstruction.
8. **Mirizzi Syndrome**: Cholecystitis with a stone in Hartman's pouch, compressing the bile duct.
9. **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis**.

In critical care, additional causes include severe sepsis, hyperperfusion, perineoplastic syndromes (often renal cell carcinoma), and complications from total parenteral nutrition.

Diagnosis involves laboratory tests showing elevated liver enzymes with conjugated bilirubin predominance, increased ALP and gamma GT. Imaging studies like ultrasound, CT scans, MRCP, or ERCP help identify the obstruction source.

Management includes hydration, antibiotics for infections such as cholangitis, and kidney function protection. Referral to specialized units is recommended for advanced management. The presentation encourages further research into local cause prevalence among trainees.
