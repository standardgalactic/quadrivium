The text describes solving problems related to sound waves, focusing on calculating amplitude, sound levels (in decibels), and differences in sound levels based on varying intensities. Key points include:

1. **Amplitude Calculation**: The problem involves finding the amplitude of a high-intensity sound wave with given parameters like frequency, air density, and velocity. An equation involving intensity (\(I\)), frequency (\(f\)), air density (\(\rho\)), and velocity (\(v\)) is used to determine amplitude (\(A_0\)).

2. **Sound Level**: The text explains calculating the sound level (\(\beta\)) using the formula \(\beta = 10 \times \log_{10} \left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right)\), where \(I\) is intensity and \(I_0\) is the reference intensity (threshold of hearing). An example calculation shows how to determine decibel levels from given intensities.

3. **Intensity from Sound Level**: It demonstrates converting a sound level back into intensity using natural logarithms, allowing for conversion between \(\beta\) in decibels and \(I\).

4. **Difference in Sound Levels**: A new equation is introduced to find the difference in sound levels (\(\beta_2 - \beta_1\)) when given two intensities (\(I_1\) and \(I_2\)). The formula derived shows that this difference depends on the logarithm of the ratio between these intensities.

5. **Non-linear Relationship**: The text emphasizes that sound intensity is not linearly proportional to perceived sound levels, illustrated by a specific example where a 50-fold increase in intensity results in only a 17-decibel change.

Overall, the text provides mathematical techniques for analyzing and understanding various aspects of sound waves and their perception.

The text discusses the relationship between sound levels measured in decibels and sound intensity on a logarithmic scale. It explains that a difference of 8 decibels between two sound levels corresponds to a specific ratio of their intensities, using the formula: \( \beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10 \log_{10} (I_2/I_1) \). Solving for intensity ratios involves taking the anti-logarithm.

The text then applies these principles to solve an example problem. Given a sound source producing 100 decibels at a distance of 2 meters, it calculates the average power output of the source. The sound level is converted into intensity using the formula \( I = I_0 \times 10^{\beta/10} \), where \( I_0 \) is the reference intensity (usually \( 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2 \)). Using this, and knowing that sound spreads out spherically from the source, it calculates the power output as approximately half a watt.
