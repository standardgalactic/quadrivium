To solve the second-order linear differential equation \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - y = \frac{1}{x} \) using variation of parameters, follow these steps:

1. **Homogeneous Solution:**  
   Solve the homogeneous equation by finding its characteristic roots. The characteristic equation is \( m^2 - 1 = 0 \), yielding roots \( m_1 = 1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). Thus, the complementary solution (homogeneous solution) is:
   \[
   y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x}
   \]

2. **Particular Solution via Variation of Parameters:**  
   Assume a particular solution in the form \( y_p = u_1(x) y_1 + u_2(x) y_2 \), where \( y_1 = e^x \) and \( y_2 = e^{-x} \).

3. **Wronskian Calculation:**  
   Calculate the Wronskian of \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \):
   \[
   W(y_1, y_2) = \begin{vmatrix}
   e^x & e^{-x} \\
   e^x & -e^{-x}
   \end{vmatrix} = -2
   \]

4. **Integrals for \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \):**  
   Apply variation of parameters to find \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \):
   - \( u_1(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{e^t}{t} dt \)
   - \( u_2(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} t e^t dt \)

5. **Final Solution:**  
   Combine the complementary and particular solutions to obtain the general solution:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} + \frac{e^x}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt - \frac{e^{-x}}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} t e^t dt
   \]

The particular solution involves non-elementary integrals, which are left in their integral form as they cannot be simplified further.
