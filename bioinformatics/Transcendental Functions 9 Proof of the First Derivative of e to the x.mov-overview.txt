The text provides a second proof for finding the derivative of \(e^x\), using concepts from calculus involving logarithms and the chain rule. Initially, it establishes that the first derivative of \(\ln(x)\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\). Using this fact, two methods are employed to prove that the first derivative of \(e^x\) equals \(e^x\).

The first method uses properties of logarithms:  
- Consider \(\frac{d}{dx} (\ln(e^x))\).
- By exponent properties, \(\ln(e^x) = x \cdot \ln(e)\), and since \(\ln(e) = 1\), this simplifies to \(x\).
- The derivative of \(x\) with respect to \(x\) is \(1\).

The second method employs the chain rule:  
- Let \(u = e^x\). Then, \(\frac{d}{dx} (\ln(u)) = \frac{1}{u}\).
- Since \(u = e^x\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{e^x}\).
- The chain rule requires multiplying by the derivative of \(u\) with respect to \(x\): \(\frac{d}{dx}(e^x)\).
- Therefore, \(\frac{d}{dx} (\ln(e^x)) = \frac{1}{e^x} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = 1\).

Equating the two expressions derived from these methods gives:  
\[ \frac{1}{e^x} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = 1 \]

Multiplying both sides by \(e^x\) results in:  
\[ \frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x \]

This concludes the proof that the derivative of \(e^x\) is indeed \(e^x\).
