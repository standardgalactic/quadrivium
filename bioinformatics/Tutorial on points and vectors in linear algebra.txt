This is a course I've been wanting to make for a long time. We're going to talk
about linear algebra. I'll put these courses out one at a time. It's something
that I'm making at home while away from work. Mathematics is a
beautiful subject. Linear algebra is at the heart of so many things that we do
with mathematics and I'm specifically thinking about something like deep
learning where we can use tenses, matrices, vectors to build models to
predict some outcome. So linear algebra really at the heart and I think if you
understand linear algebra you understand a lot about mathematics and it's really a
beautiful part of mathematics and I really would like you to be as enthused
as I am about it. I'm going to use a computer language together with the
explanation and I really think that's the modern way that we should approach
teaching mathematics. We are going to use code, most of us are going to use code
when it comes to the mathematics that we are using and just to be exposed to that
as soon as possible is great. So this is not about teaching you a computer
language. I do have courses for that both on Udemy and on Coursera so you can get a
university certificate even from one of the courses that I do teach and what we're
going to use is the Wolfram language. The Wolfram language is really built
around symbolic mathematics and that's what we're going to do. We use symbols and it
really is the language that works best. Now you can write your own code, you can do
that in a browser, just open a free account with Wolfram on the Wolfram
cloud or you can buy a small subscription and with that for instance you could get
a desktop version of the Wolfram language that you can use on your own
system but otherwise you can just use it free of charge. This is not about the code.
You'll see the code but the code is there to draw something to the screen or to check on
some result of a calculation just to show you how easy it is to do with a code
versus what we do by hand. Now we're going to do it by hand by that I mean it is
written on the screen so not to worry about that. It is about the linear algebra
but I'm just going to bring the code in it as a modern form of teaching the
subject. So in this very first video we're just going to talk about points and
vectors. Everyone understands what a point is on a 2d plane or perhaps even a
point somewhere here in space. It has a three components to it, x, y and z component
but from there we can very naturally move on to what a vector is. Without wasting any
further time let's go have a look at points and vectors. So from points to
vectors I think most of us are familiar with points and if we look at this flat
surface that we have in front of us we can just put a point anywhere and if we
have this Cartesian coordinate system where the bottom of your screen is in the
x-axis and the left side up of your screen is the y-axis we can denote a point.
There's a pixel and that pixel will have a position and we usually it's important
mathematics of course how we write things down and there's certain certain rules
that we stick to. So I think in most textbooks you are going to see something
like this where we have a point like you see there 3 2 so the 3 comma 2 that's a
tuple, a 2 tuple and as much as the two values there they separated by a comma
they're inside of parentheses and they go directly after the name of the point and
we can also use the subscript notation so here we have point zero being at x sub
zero y sub zero or point 1 at 3 comma 2 and point 2 at 0 comma 1 etc that's just a
point and that is how I'm going to write a point. The subscripts of course are
elements of the natural number so if I have points I just have let's include zero
with those numbers as well and that's set so 0 1 2 3 as the subscripts. So here we
have our first function in the Warframe language I'm going to reiterate this is not
about learning the the Warframe language but it certainly helps remember you can
run this in the cloud free of charge just go in your web in your web browser to
the Warframe cloud sign up for free account you can do all of this yourself
I've got course courses available to you all the links are down below for you to
to learn the Warframe language should you want to I'm going to use it as so just
something to to illustrate the mathematics I do think it is important to do that in in
a modern world so it's a functional language so we're going to have functions and there
you see the function there function is a keyword and Mathematica or the Warframe language at
least has more than I think five or six thousand of these after those you'll always see a set of
square brackets there's my opening square bracket my closing square bracket and inside of those go
parameters or arguments and all arguments are separated by commas so you see these commas there
and that gives information to the function so that the function actually do something in when you bake
a cake and you put it in the oven but there's lots of ingredients that go inside of that and out
pops a cake your oven uses all those ingredients and out pops a cake there's your function so all
I'm specifying here is something about a point and because I want to specify more than one things about
a point I put those things inside of a set of curly braces which you're going to see there and there
and they've also got commas between them and between curly braces is something that we call a list so I'm
saying point size and again point size is just going to be another function so I can pass functions as
arguments to other functions and because it's a function we see the open and closed square brackets
then 0.05 that's going to be the size of the point that I have and you can see the point down there
um you can see what it's going to be I want it to be red and then the position of it and there we go there's my
point three comma two so if we go down the x-axis on this side we get to three and if we go up to we
get to that over there and that's how we get the point three comma two and then comma outside of that
list I just put have some attributes access I set to true so that we can see the x and y axis and I
have access labels and again there's a pair of them I pass them as a list so that you can see the word x-axis
there and y-axis there and that comes from there so it really is as simple as that the point is I'm
not going to teach you the Wolfram language here I think it's very easy to pick up when you look at
it like this instead of trying to learn how to use the language after a while it'll just come come to
you in a quite a natural way the point being here is linear algebra and we've got a point and we can
denote a point by its address on the surface or within the volume that we are talking with here
we have a surface so we can give it an address three on the x-axis up two on the y-axis three comma two
there's our point and to illustrate the point I've got quite a few points here and here I've just given
them computer variable names p underscore one p underscore two up to p underscore four and I've
given them their coordinates instead of a set of curly braces denoting a Wolfram language list but that
would be the same as us writing in a mathematics textbook point point one three comma two that's
exactly what we're doing so we're doing them all in red again and in the point instead of a single
point I'm passing a whole list of points so the list list goes inside of curly braces and the rest
pretty much the same although I haven't said x-axis and y-axis as the axis labels there but once again
the point being I can clearly see this is point number one and it's at three comma two because that
three goes down to the x-axis and the two goes to the y-axis and it's it's quite simple to see here we
see point p four because it is at two comma minus one and you can work out what these other points
are going to be so that's really simple enough and as I've written here let's change our point of view
now we all know about points so let's just say change them to vectors and here we can see
that we are trying to get to the same point if you think about that if I put a dot there that's the
same point p three comma two because I'm still going three on the x-axis up two but now I could
just imagine walking there from the origin and we call this the origin the origin will be a point zero
comma zero if this is two-dimensional space or two space and I just walk three along the x-axis and I
denote that by long arrow of which the tail I have a tail of my green arrow here and I have a head
on this side so there's the head and here by the origin is the tail and then this green one will also
have its own tail at the bottom here and its own head there so if I do this little walk indicated by
these arrows or vectors I get to the same point and that becomes that obviously becomes quite important
to us when we talk about that so instead of these two walks along the x-axis up the y-axis I can just walk
straight to the point and this green thing is indeed a vector we will call this a vector
and we've just seen though that a vector does have components we saw it go along the x-axis and we saw
it go up the y-axis so immediately you should have this intuitive understanding that I can add these two
things somehow these two walks and that will just give me this resultant walk this resultant vector
and you can see the code here again it's just a graphics function there I'm making a slightly
slightly smaller point size it's still in red it's still at 3.2 and then though I want a green thick
arrow and the arrow goes from the origin there's my 0.0 at the origin and there's the final point that
it goes to that was my point and it goes to that point and everything else there quite self-explanatory
so a point and a vector is just two ways to represent basically the same spot on the plane
but I can do so much more with the vectors than I can do just for the points
so that brings me just to how we write these things down here you see one notation this is
this is the angled bracket notation as you can see here and you can also see that I broke this down
into two separate ones v first of all you see the underscore there let's say v with an underscore
so many textbooks will have that and that denotes that this is a vector instead of a point or anything
else so we put that little underline on it v with an underline and then also we use these little
angle brackets here and it says 3.2 but what it is really there it is the x value and the y value
and I've done just that remember the two green vectors initially that would be the first one that
went along the x direction and this one that went along the y direction and I can write the two of them
separately as well because the v sub x vector went along until 0.3 comma 0 3 on the x axis 0 on the y
axis and y went from 0 to 2 but that might look a bit strange to you because it didn't start at 0 it
started at 3 so what's going on here for now just these little angle brackets you'll see them all over
the show but you can start to see that there's something going on here because if I add 3 and 0
I get 3 and if I add 0 and 2 I get 2 so there's this intuitive idea of adding vectors and it also
brings us to this why is it 0 comma 2 because you see these two green vectors here first of all you'll
see the tail of this one here and the tail of this one is at the origin and the head is up there and the
head is up there and these two vectors are exactly the same vector there's no difference between the
two just because we've displaced it laterally here it is still the same vector so that's something that
you should really get used to this vector on the left hand side is just called the positional vector
sometimes called the positional vector that just means take any vector and just sort of transport it
so that its tail is at the origin we just want to place this at the origin but no matter where we
move this tail these two are still the same vector I could have moved this one up on the right hand side
further up further left further right further down but as long as it's the same length and you can
clearly see that this is the same length so length is going to be very important to us with vectors
vectors and it also has the same direction because from physics it's really intuitive it's an intuitive
way to understand vectors that it has this this idea of there's a physicality to it it is something
that has a length and a direction and anyway where you go when you walk now you're going to walk for a
certain distance and in a certain direction and of course you can change directions many times and that
is just the addition of a bunch of little vectors and i can bring all of them with their tails back
to the origin and that'll be exactly the same thing and you'll soon see that so remember this idea of
the positional vector which means we can also write it in this as far as linear algebra is concerned in a
much better way these we call column vectors this is a column vector where's my end column vector
we're going to have a lot to say about column vectors you can clearly see it's written as a column
and they're two rows to my column two rows to my single column so there's row number one row number one
and there's row number two so there's two rows in a single column this vector v sub x is then what we
would call a two by one vector it's always row and then column always in that order so it has two rows
in one column and because it has one column we call this a column vector and that means v sub y is also
column vector and it is written like that zero and two the x component is zero so it's not moving along
the x component at all but it's moving plus or positive two on the y component and that's exactly
the two vectors that you see here both of them are v y and both of them are zero two
it's the same column vector that we see in both representations and now it makes it very easy for us
to see this idea of the addition of vectors because if i add these two column vectors on the left hand
side the v sub x and the v sub y i get exactly that because what we see here is actually called a linear
system and we're going to talk all about linear systems but let me write down the word a linear
system this is a different way of writing a linear system and as much as what it says there is that
i've got two equations it says three plus zero equals three and zero plus two equals two
it's just a succinct way of writing a linear system a system of linear equations and we're going to talk
all about that and and sometimes people just start off with those things and it's not always that
intuitive to understand where it comes from but if you see it this way it actually i think it actually
makes a lot of sense there's nothing there's nothing difficult here it's very intuitive so of course
we need to stick to the plane surface here we can go up in another dimension and here we have vector w
and it's in three-dimensional space so it has an x value it has a y value and a z value so we're going
up so not only do you have to walk on the floor but you can get in the lift and go further up
and these vectors live in a certain space and before when we only had two elements in our column vector
we were in r2 and we write r there it's the set of real numbers because we are denoting here that the
elements are real numbers we can also have something like c2 and that will be a vector
where the elements can be complex numbers but we're not going to get into that anytime soon so let's
take that away the r there just refers to the fact that we're talking about real number entries in three
and two and one okay they are integers but they're also that's a subset of the reals so if we go to
three-dimensional space of course this will be a vector in r3 as you can see there and we can go up
we can only imagine three dimensions in our heads but of course there's no limitation on that we can
let n be much larger than three and we get into what we call hyperspace
so different ways to uh to look at vectors the physicality of it is something that has a length
and a direction but we can also um view it in slightly different way instead of having these
three components we can look at it in this way so here trying to represent doesn't really fit on the
screen three dimensions so you see the x-axis moves down here to the side the y-axis is there and then
the z-axis goes all the way up and then we have still this origin at the bottom right here is our
origin and this vector comes out in three-dimensional space this is a right hand coordinate system
because imagine that you can contort yourself putting your right hand palm at the origin pointing
towards the x-axis and then swinging just swinging your fingers over to the y-axis your thumb
if you extend your thumb it points straight up so this is a right hand and it's a bit difficult
the first time to go from x down the bottom of your screen and y straight up to this contorted view
but it actually it's it's the best way just trust me on that one's the best way to do so we can
deconstruct this vector a little bit because imagine we look straight down we we can look straight
down onto the floor so imagine the x and y-axis are down on the floor and i'm looking straight
down at the origin straight down the barrel of the y-axis the z-axis i should say that vector that
comes out has this projection down onto the floor and this is this let's call it a projection for now
although we'll get to projections and that is this representation right down here this little one
down here it is the projection of this one down onto the xy plane and it has a length of r as you can see
there we can do that it will have this vx component here for sure it will have a v y component which we
see back there a v y component back there and it also has a height and the height will be down from
the floor up so we have our v z component there and you can see where we've indicated them here
it also has a length like any other vector and you can quickly see how we're going to write a length
it's quite a cumbersome way that is the length of a vector we're going to call it a norm
it has a length but there's some other things here too the two angles that we're talking about
so here's our positive x-axis our positive x-axis on this side and we can see this angle theta
it swings out from the positive x-axis to this projection to the projection on the xy plane
and then we also see this angle phi up here and that is just an angle from the z-axis and how much does
it lean across from straight up how much does it lean over so you can see that the interval on which
we can find that angle is from zero is less than or equal to phi is less than equal to pi radians
because you can only go straight down to the bottom here and then the theta is going to go all the way
to two pi it can go all the way around the circle in actual fact it can go many times around and
there's some lovely peculiarities about that as well and we'll certainly get to those too
so you can see the intuition here of how can we how we describe this vector its head here of the vector
how can we describe it as a positional vector in other words the tail is at the origin yes it has an
x y and z component and i can write it like that but i can also write it in terms of this radius r
and i can write it in terms of this angle theta and i can also write it in terms of this height or
or alternatively as this angle so we have this idea that we have a multivariable calculus
where we can use cylindrical coordinates or spherical coordinates none of that matters now i think all
of this i'm just hoping that this makes intuitive really intuitive sense so let's get to this idea of
the norm of a vector and you see we've got vector v here well there's again the notation and i tried to
put things that i just want to if i view my documents quickly i want to see all the important
terms i put those in green which means in that area of that green i'm defining that term so that when
you see green like this that's just just the way my head works and when i do use highlighters
very sparingly but every color means a different thing i don't just go for any color all over the show
anyway so we see vector v here it's represented in two different ways with the angle brackets or as a
column vector and we're going to stick to this column vector notation not in the physics notation but
in linear algebra notation and we're going to get the norm of that vector with this ugly notation
with the with those double lines on both sides and it actually makes intuitive sense so let me try and
get a ruler here
there we go i'm going to have my ruler again and there was just the axis that we were dealing with
remember there's my x-axis and y-axis so we're only dealing with r2 here that's a vector in r2
and there's our little vector going out there remember it has an x and a y component so there's
going to be my x component there's going to be my y component and there's a little angle there theta
and this is a right angle triangle so pythagoras to the rescue what is the length of that vector
well it's just the right angle triangle so if this vector is v it is just going to have a length or a
norm just of the square root of x squared it's x component and it's y component it's as simple as that
so if we have three and two there it's three squared plus two squares that's 13 so square root of 13
it's the length of my vector so it really is as simple as that and if it was out in in three
dimensions i'm just going to add plus z squared to that so i'm just adding the squares of the of its
components and that's just pythagoras so nothing there not difficult to imagine that a vector really
has a length now i can specify vector in the warframe language we've seen that so i'm giving it a name
that's how computer languages work so it can't be one of the five thousand six thousand odd
keywords or functions so it's usually this lowercase letter that we give it and the equal sign in a
computer language is not an equal sign it's an assignment operator it assigns whatever's on the
right hand side of it to whatever's on the left hand side of it so on the right hand side i have a
list object and it is a list because they're the set of curly braces and i've got two elements in
there three comma two and i'm assigning that to a computer variable so v is called a computer variable
and what a computer variable is is what the language does is it reserves a little space in your computer's
memory it gives it a name and that's the name v and it assigns an object to that little piece of
memory and at the moment i'm adding i'm putting a list object inside of that piece of memory and i
call it v but that's how we represent a column vector as a list object in the warframe language
and now i can just use the norm function and i pass it that little piece of memory which contains my
list object and out pops square root of 13 so norm and then just the name of that so i could also have
just written if i didn't want to save it as a name i could have written norm and just pass the 3 comma 2
there exactly the same thing by the way this semi the semicolon you see there that just means don't
print the result back to the screen just keep it to yourself please and that's all it does so there i
just show you if i have another if i have another dimension i just keep on adding the squares of the
components and again then the norm of of a vector in 3 space 3 comma 2 comma 1 is going to be 14
which brings us to the point of the the two unit vectors and we write a unit vector with that little
hat on top of it so instead of the underline the unit vector of v would be v with a little hat on it
and what does a unit vector mean it means i'm taking my original vector and it's still pointing
in the same direction so if i look at it in three space the theta and the phi is still going to be
the same but i wanted to have unit length unit length meaning a length of one and how do i do that
well it's actually very simple i just take a vector and i get its length and in the end this is what i do
i divide the vector by its norm which means each component is going to be divided by the length of
the whole vector so there's some fancy notation for the norm of a vector get used to that one
because that's much neater way of writing it it says the square of the sum of all the components
squared and the components is one to n n being the number of components it's exactly what we did if we
have a long vector we had to write all those squares out but that's just a succinct way of writing
it so if i take every vector and every component of the vector and i divide it by
the norm of the vector so look at that if i have a vector that is one three and four and we had the
vector one three and four up here the vector oh we didn't we'll have to do we'll have to do that one
by hand but anyway it's square root of 26 so the norm of this vector is going to be the square root of
one squared plus three squared plus four squared and if we do that that's the square root of one
plus nine plus 16 and that's the square root of 26 so that's the norm and what we're doing here
on the inside here we're just taking the vector and we're dividing it by the norm of the vector
so each component gets divided by that norm so it's going to be one divided by square root 26
that's going to be my unit vector v hat and then we have three divided by square root 26
and then four divided by square root 26 and that's exactly what we see here we just see a cleanup there
of the square root 26 there and you might be told never to express something like that just
multiplied by that so that would be the square root of 26 divided by 26 and of course you can you can try
and clean that up a bit as well and as i mean in the case of this one and the thing about a unit vector
if you think of its norm it's going to have it's going to have a length of one it's really just going to
have a length of one so if i were to take the norm of this unit vector it's going to be the square root
of one over square root 26 squared plus three over square root 26 squared and then four over square root
26 and those squared and if you work that out this is going to be one by the nature of the beast because
we've divided it by that so if we if we square all of those we're just going to get to one that means
the length of one so all we're doing in this instance that was ugly is if i have my vector out
here it's going to be the exactly the same vector but it's just going to have a unit length so it's
going to be one long but the direction is still exactly the same which brings us to this the standard
unit vectors and that is where we just we just go one in the direction of my if we look if we had this
idea of our three dimensional vectors so there's my x there's my y there's my z so i'm going to go
along each of these i'm going to go along each of these and they're each going to have a length of one
and we usually call these i hat and j hat and k hat going along those components and that makes it
very easy for me to express you can see them express their column vectors one zero zero one in the x
direction nothing in the y nothing in the z and here with i with j nothing in the x direction one unit
along the j and zero and then zero zero one as simple as that which also means i can express any vector
as this linear combination of the standard unit vectors so if i had a vector three comma two comma one
that i wanted to express that will be three times the i hat one plus twice the j hat plus the k hat that'll be
exactly the same because this is going to be three zero zero this is going to be zero two zero and this
is going to be zero zero one and if i add them up remember my linear system that's going to be three
two one exactly what we want so we can use these constant multiples of a unit vector and now we already
see scalar vector multiplication in the go if i have this and i multiply it by three it means each component
is multiplied by three and in this instance it's going to make this i hat just three times longer
because that's going to be three zero zero and if you take the norm of that it's going to be three
times longer than the unit vector all very simple and intuitive let's just then also talk about the
direction of a vector and once again if i look just in two-dimensional space let's have that let's have
our vector up here and down here again that's our x component our y component this is a square
that's our angle and because that's a square a right-sided triangle you can just use trigonometry
the tangent of theta well that's this opposite divided by adjacent opposite is y adjacent
is x and which means that theta is the arc tangent the arc tangent of y of x and that's as simple as that
and the only problem with trigonometry you really have to be careful in what quadrant you are in
so what i've done here is just looked at these quadrants here is my first vector it is at
this is a vector one square root of three i can write it like that that's that vector and which
means my x component is one my y component is square root of three it's in the first quadrant and if i
take the arc tangent of that i'm going to get pi over three which means this angle right here
with a positive x-axis is pi over three theta equals pi over three so it's easy then to do the arc tangent
and the arc tangent has a function as you can see there in the warframe language
arc in uppercase tan and that is my y and that is my x and the result comes back pi over three
so let's shift this along to the second quadrant in other words my x-axis is now negative square root
of three so what i'm doing here is the arc tangent of one over negative the square root of three and
the arc tangent of that is minus pi over six so that looks a bit difficult because what we're
interested in really is this angle that's what we're interested in so really when you get that
remember that that must be subtracted from pi this whole straight line is pi and i'm just subtracting
this little bit from the whole from the whole thing and that gives me this angle that i'm interested
in so there's five six pi so look out when you do the arc tangent you're gonna you just have to
visualize in your head and what quadrant is this what am i looking for from the positive x-axis to the
vector if we move on another pi over two radians i'm now negative one comma negative square root of
three and if i take the arc tangent of that i get pi over three but this time i've got to subtract it
from pi because what we usually do here is that let me just fill this in for you so those two axis
and we go from the positive x-axis but we usually we just stop there at pi radians once it goes over
pi radians we actually can express it as a negative so on this side we'll express it as a negative and
on this side as a positive but that's just convention and this is something you've got to get
you've just got to get used to so in this instance it's pi over three i add it to negative pi because
this whole thing would be negative pi negative pi radians and i subtract that so i get my negative
two-thirds pi so this angle here the one that i'm really interested in is that one and that's what i'm
going to get and then in the fourth quadrant again now we're still interested in this as a negative
angle and in the fourth quadrant you can just use arctane you don't have to involve pi with that
so i hope that made intuitive sense what vectors are and how i think everything that you're going
to learn about vectors just come from this very basic things they're very simple to understand
and some simple concepts just to get used to and there's nothing there's nothing much to it
we can do some very exciting stuff for them and certainly that's what we're aiming for
