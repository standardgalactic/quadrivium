The text explains how Newton's third law can be derived from symmetry principles, particularly translational invariance and homogeneous space. It emphasizes using a thought experiment involving "virtual displacement," as proposed by d'Alembert, to explore the symmetrical conditions of a particle system.

1. **Symmetry Principle**: The derivation starts with the idea that nature's laws, including Newton's laws, can be understood through symmetry principles rather than being accepted axiomatically. Translational invariance is key here: shifting an object or system without altering its internal structure should not change any properties.

2. **Thought Experiment**: By imagining a closed system of particles moving instantaneously from one point to another (a virtual displacement), the speaker notes that no external work affects the system, leading to a net force of zero internally.

3. **Derivation of Newton's Third Law**:
   - The principle of translational invariance implies that total internal forces must sum to zero. Consequently, for every action (force exerted by one particle on another), there is an equal and opposite reaction.
   
4. **Connection with Newton's Laws**: Accepting Newtonâ€™s second law (force equals the rate of change of momentum) allows the demonstration of momentum conservation in a system. For a two-particle system, this results in linear momentum conservation.

5. **Conclusion**: The text concludes that translational invariance and homogeneous space are linked to momentum conservation, naturally leading to Newton's third law through symmetry principles and conservation laws.

The discussion further involves a two-particle system where total momentum \( dp \) is expressed as the sum of individual momenta changes over time (\( dt \)). By showing that the rate of change of total momentum is zero, it underscores momentum conservation. The text demonstrates that if one particle experiences a force, another must experience an equal and opposite force, consistent with Newton's third law.

Through these principles, it deduces that linear momentum remains constant (its change equals zero) due to system symmetry. This understanding derives Newton's third law as a consequence of symmetries and conservation principles. The mathematical manipulation further supports the principle that forces between two interacting particles are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
