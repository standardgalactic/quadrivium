Here's a concise summary of the provided text:

The text explores how light behaves when transitioning between two different media, focusing on refraction and reflection principles. Key points include:

1. **Refraction and Reflection Basics**: 
   - Angles of incidence, reflection, and refraction are measured relative to a normal line at the interface.
   - Refractive index varies with wavelength, affecting light bending.

2. **Monochromatic Light**:
   - Simplifies calculations by assuming constant refractive indices using monochromatic light.

3. **Refractive Index and Angles**:
   - Describes how light bends toward or away from the normal depending on whether it moves to a medium with a higher or lower refractive index, respectively.
   
4. **Total Internal Reflection (TIR)**:
   - Occurs when light in a denser medium hits the boundary at an angle greater than the critical angle, causing all light to reflect internally rather than refract out.

5. **Snellâ€™s Law**: 
   - Provides the formula \( n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \sin(\theta_t) \), linking angles of incidence and refraction with their respective refractive indices.

6. **Practical Example**:
   - A prism example shows light being totally internally reflected at a 45-degree angle, calculating a minimum refractive index of approximately 1.414.
   - Discusses that higher refractive indices decrease the critical angle, enabling TIR at smaller angles.

7. **Conclusion on Refractive Index for TIR**:
   - Determines that for TIR to occur at an incident angle of 45 degrees, a minimum refractive index of about 1.414 is necessary.
   - Higher indices allow TIR at even smaller angles (e.g., critical angle decreases to 41.8 degrees for \( n_i = 1.5 \)).

Overall, the text underscores how variations in refractive indices influence light behavior and emphasizes understanding the critical angle essential for total internal reflection in optics.
