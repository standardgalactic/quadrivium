To solve for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \) using matrix algebra, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up the System of Equations
Formulate two equations:
- \( u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2 = 0 \)
- \( u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2' = f(x) \)

Express these in matrix form:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 & y_2 \\
y_1' & y_2'
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1' \\
u_2'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the System Using Matrix Inversion
Identify the coefficient matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
y_1 & y_2 \\
y_1' & y_2'
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Calculate its determinant:

\[
\text{det}(A) = y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'
\]

If the determinant is non-zero, find \( A^{-1} \):

\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_2' & -y_2 \\
-y_1' & y_1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Solution
Multiply both sides by \( A^{-1} \):

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1' \\
u_2'
\end{bmatrix}
=
A^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This results in:

\[
u_1' = \frac{-y_2 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
\]
\[
u_2' = \frac{y_1 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
\]

### Step 4: Integrate to Find \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \)
Integrate the expressions for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \) with respect to \( x \) to obtain \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \).

The text describes a process used in solving non-homogeneous linear differential equations via the method of variation of parameters. The functions \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) are derived by integrating the expressions for their derivatives, \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \), with respect to \( x \). Specifically:

- \( u_1(x) \) is obtained by integrating 

  \[
  u_1' = \frac{-y_2 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
  \]

- \( u_2(x) \) is obtained by integrating 

  \[
  u_2' = \frac{y_1 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
  \]

Here, \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) are solutions to the corresponding homogeneous differential equation, and \( f(x) \) is a function from the non-homogeneous part of the equation. The denominator \( y_1y_2' - y_2y_1' \) is known as the Wronskian of the functions \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \). By integrating these expressions, we obtain particular solutions that contribute to solving the original non-homogeneous differential equation.
