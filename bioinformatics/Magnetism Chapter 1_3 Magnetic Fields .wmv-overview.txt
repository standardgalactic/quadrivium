The text discusses several physics problems related to electric and magnetic fields acting on electrons. Here's a summary:

1. **Electric and Magnetic Fields Interaction**: An electron moves under the influence of perpendicular electric (1,500 V/m) and magnetic (0.400 T) fields. To achieve equilibrium where the forces cancel each other out, the velocity \( v \) of the electron must satisfy \( v = E/B \), where \( E \) is the electric field strength and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength.

2. **Hall Effect**: The text explains how a magnetic field affects conduction electrons in a metal plate (current flowing from top to bottom). Electrons experience a force due to the magnetic field, causing them to accumulate on one side of the plate. This separation creates an electric field opposing the magnetic force, reaching equilibrium where the two forces cancel.

3. **Calculating Drift Velocity and Charge Carrier Density**:
   - The drift velocity \( v_d \) is given by \( E/B \).
   - The charge carrier density \( n \) can be calculated using the relation \( n = i/(e \cdot b \cdot l \cdot v) \), where \( i \) is the current, \( e \) is the electron charge, \( b \) is the magnetic field strength, \( l \) is the length of the conductor, and \( v \) is the drift velocity.

The discussion emphasizes how these principles can be used to measure physical quantities like the number density of charge carriers in a material.
