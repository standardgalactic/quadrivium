The text discusses several physics problems related to electric and magnetic fields acting on electrons. Here's a summary:

1. **Electric and Magnetic Fields Interaction**: An electron moves under the influence of perpendicular electric (1,500 V/m) and magnetic (0.400 T) fields. To achieve equilibrium where the forces cancel each other out, the velocity \( v \) of the electron must satisfy \( v = E/B \), where \( E \) is the electric field strength and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength.

2. **Hall Effect**: The text explains how a magnetic field affects conduction electrons in a metal plate (current flowing from top to bottom). Electrons experience a force due to the magnetic field, causing them to accumulate on one side of the plate. This separation creates an electric field opposing the magnetic force, reaching equilibrium where the two forces cancel.

3. **Calculating Drift Velocity and Charge Carrier Density**:
   - The drift velocity \( v_d \) is given by \( E/B \).
   - The charge carrier density \( n \) can be calculated using the relation \( n = i/(e \cdot b \cdot l \cdot v) \), where \( i \) is the current, \( e \) is the electron charge, \( b \) is the magnetic field strength, \( l \) is the length of the conductor, and \( v \) is the drift velocity.

The discussion emphasizes how these principles can be used to measure physical quantities like the number density of charge carriers in a material.

The text discusses a series of physics problems involving electric fields, magnetic fields, and the motion of electrons. Here's a summary:

1. **Problem 1: Zero Net Force on an Electron**
   - An electron is subjected to perpendicular electric and magnetic fields with magnitudes given as \(E\) and \(B\).
   - The condition for zero net force (and hence constant velocity) on the electron requires the electric force (\(qE\)) to equal the magnetic force (\(qvB\)), where \(q\) is the charge of the electron, \(v\) its velocity.
   - Solving \(qE = qvB\) gives the velocity as \(v = \frac{E}{B}\).

2. **Problem 2: Drift Velocity in a Magnetic Field**
   - The drift velocity (\(v_d\)) of electrons in a conductor carrying current perpendicular to a magnetic field is considered.
   - Using the relation for zero net force, \(eE = evB\) (with \(e\) being the magnitude of the electron charge), the electric field induced by this setup results in an equilibrium condition where \(v_d = \frac{E}{B}\).
   - The Hall effect can be utilized to determine the number density of charge carriers (\(n\)) through the relation: 
     \[
     n = \frac{IB}{eVd}
     \]
   - Here, \(I\) is the current, \(B\) the magnetic field strength, \(e\) the electron charge, and \(V_d\) (the Hall voltage) is related to the induced electric field as \(E = \frac{V_d}{d}\).

The text emphasizes understanding how these principles are used in practical scenarios, such as measuring carrier density using the Hall effect, where measurable quantities like current, magnetic field strength, potential difference, and dimensions of the conductor provide insights into microscopic properties.
