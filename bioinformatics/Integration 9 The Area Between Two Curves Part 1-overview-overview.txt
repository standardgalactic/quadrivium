The text describes how to calculate the area between two curves \( f \) and \( g \) using integration. By plotting these functions on a graph, you can find the area between them by subtracting the lower curve \( g \) from the upper curve \( f \) at each point \( x \). This subtraction gives the height of rectangles used to approximate the area.

To approximate this area, midpoint sums are used where each rectangle has a width \(\Delta x\) and a height equal to \(f(x) - g(x)\). The area for each rectangle is calculated as \((f(x) - g(x)) \times \Delta x\).

The total area is found by summing the areas of all rectangles across the interval, expressed in sigma notation. To obtain the exact area between the curves, you take the limit of these sums as the number of rectangles \( n \) approaches infinity, resulting in a definite integral that represents the area over the specified interval.
