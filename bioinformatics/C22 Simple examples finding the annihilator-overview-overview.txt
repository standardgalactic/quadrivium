The text outlines examples of annihilating differential operators for various types of functions:

1. **Polynomial Example**:
   - For the polynomial \(1 - 5x^2 + 8x^3\), its fourth derivative is zero, so the operator \(D^4\) (where \(D\) denotes differentiation) serves as an annihilator.

2. **Exponential Function Example**:
   - The function \(e^{-3x}\) is annihilated by the operator \(D + 3\). Differentiating \(e^{-3x}\) yields \(-3e^{-3x}\), and adding \(3e^{-3x}\) results in zero.

3. **Exponential Polynomial Example**:
   - For \(4e^{2x} - 10xe^{2x}\), the operator \((D - 2)^2\) is used to annihilate it, involving a combination of differentiation and adjustments that lead to zero.

The key point is that these operators eliminate the functions by differentiating them until they become zero. For exponential polynomials, the necessary order of differentiation depends on both the degree of the polynomial part and the exponential factor involved.
