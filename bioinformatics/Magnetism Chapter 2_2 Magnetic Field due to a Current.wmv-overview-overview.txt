The text explains how to determine the magnetic field at a point \( P \) due to currents flowing through straight wires and an arc by applying principles of electromagnetism. Here's a summary:

1. **Straight Wires**: The magnetic field from infinitely long straight wires is calculated using the Biot-Savart law, considering the angle between the current element and radius vector. If this angle is 0 or 180 degrees, the contribution to the field at point \( P \) is zero.

2. **Arc Contribution**: For an arc segment, the magnetic field can be determined with the formula \( \mu_0 i \phi / (4 \pi r) \), where \( \phi \) is the angle subtended by the arc.

3. **Configuration and Geometry**: Two straight wires are analyzedâ€”one with current entering the board and another exiting it. At point \( P \), which forms a 90-degree angle between the two wires, distances can be calculated using trigonometric functions due to symmetry (e.g., cosine of 45 degrees).

4. **Magnetic Field Calculation**: For each wire, the magnetic field is given by \( B = \mu_0 I / (2 \pi R) \), with \( R \) derived from the geometry involving distance \( D \).

5. **Vector Considerations**: To find the net magnetic field at point \( P \), both the magnitude and direction of fields due to each wire must be considered, using vector addition.

The text also explains how to determine the direction of magnetic fields around current-carrying wires using the right-hand rule: the thumb points in the direction of conventional current, and the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field. This results in a perpendicular relationship between the current and its magnetic field. 

For two wires with currents \( I_1 \) and \( I_2 \), their magnetic fields at point \( P \) are determined by considering circles around each wire to indicate the directions. The resultant magnetic field is found through vector addition, with the angle between combined fields calculated using trigonometric functions like tangent.

Overall, symmetry in the setup and perpendicularity of magnetic fields to current directions are emphasized, forming a spiral pattern that aids understanding of how multiple currents interact magnetically.
