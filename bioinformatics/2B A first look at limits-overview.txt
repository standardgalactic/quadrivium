The passage you provided explains a fundamental concept in calculus: limits, specifically how they apply when evaluating functions that might not be defined at certain points.

Here's a breakdown of the main concepts:

1. **Limit Basics**: 
   - A limit describes what value a function approaches as the input (often denoted \( t \) or \( x \)) gets closer to some point.
   - Itâ€™s important to note that in limits, we don't actually evaluate the function at that exact point; instead, we look at values around it.

2. **Example of Limit with Defined Function**:
   - Consider a simple function like \( f(t) = t^2 \). The limit as \( t \) approaches 2 is 4 because as \( t \) gets closer to 2 from either side (left or right), the value of \( t^2 \) gets closer to 4.

3. **Limits with Undefined Points**:
   - Sometimes, a function isn't defined at a certain point due to division by zero or other issues.
   - For example, consider \( f(t) = \frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2} \). At \( t = 2 \), the function is undefined because it results in division by zero. However, if you simplify the expression (factoring gives \( \frac{(t-2)(t+2)}{t-2} \)), you see that for all \( t \neq 2 \), this simplifies to \( f(t) = t + 2 \).
   - As \( t \) approaches 2, the value of \( f(t) \) approaches 4. Thus, the limit as \( t \) approaches 2 is 4, even though \( f(2) \) is undefined.

4. **Piecewise Functions**:
   - A piecewise function can have different definitions for different parts of its domain.
   - For instance, if a function is defined as \( f(t) = \frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2} \) when \( t \neq 2 \), and \( f(t) = 3 \) when \( t = 2 \), the limit as \( t \) approaches 2 remains 4. This is because limits depend on the behavior of the function around the point, not at the point itself.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The key takeaway is that a limit describes the behavior of a function as it approaches a certain point from either side, regardless of whether the function is actually defined or takes a different value at that specific point.

Understanding limits is crucial for calculus because they form the foundation for derivatives and integrals, which are used to analyze changes and areas under curves.
