The passage you provided explains a fundamental concept in calculus: limits, specifically how they apply when evaluating functions that might not be defined at certain points.

Here's a breakdown of the main concepts:

1. **Limit Basics**: 
   - A limit describes what value a function approaches as the input (often denoted \( t \) or \( x \)) gets closer to some point.
   - Itâ€™s important to note that in limits, we don't actually evaluate the function at that exact point; instead, we look at values around it.

2. **Example of Limit with Defined Function**:
   - Consider a simple function like \( f(t) = t^2 \). The limit as \( t \) approaches 2 is 4 because as \( t \) gets closer to 2 from either side (left or right), the value of \( t^2 \) gets closer to 4.

3. **Limits with Undefined Points**:
   - Sometimes, a function isn't defined at a certain point due to division by zero or other issues.
   - For example, consider \( f(t) = \frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2} \). At \( t = 2 \), the function is undefined because it results in division by zero. However, if you simplify the expression (factoring gives \( \frac{(t-2)(t+2)}{t-2} \)), you see that for all \( t \neq 2 \), this simplifies to \( f(t) = t + 2 \).
   - As \( t \) approaches 2, the value of \( f(t) \) approaches 4. Thus, the limit as \( t \) approaches 2 is 4, even though \( f(2) \) is undefined.

4. **Piecewise Functions**:
   - A piecewise function can have different definitions for different parts of its domain.
   - For instance, if a function is defined as \( f(t) = \frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2} \) when \( t \neq 2 \), and \( f(t) = 3 \) when \( t = 2 \), the limit as \( t \) approaches 2 remains 4. This is because limits depend on the behavior of the function around the point, not at the point itself.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The key takeaway is that a limit describes the behavior of a function as it approaches a certain point from either side, regardless of whether the function is actually defined or takes a different value at that specific point.

Understanding limits is crucial for calculus because they form the foundation for derivatives and integrals, which are used to analyze changes and areas under curves.

You've provided a detailed explanation about limits, particularly focusing on how they behave around points where functions might not be defined or have discontinuities. Let's break down and clarify some of the key concepts you discussed:

### Limits and Continuity

1. **Understanding Limits**: 
   - A limit describes what value a function approaches as the input (or \( t \) in your case) gets closer to a certain point.
   - Mathematically, we write this as \(\lim_{t \to a} f(t) = L\), meaning that as \( t \) approaches \( a \), \( f(t) \) approaches \( L \).

2. **Discontinuities and Limits**:
   - A function can have a discontinuity at a point where it is not defined, such as when there's division by zero.
   - Despite the function being undefined at that point, the limit might still exist if the values of the function approach a specific number from both sides.

3. **Example with \(\frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2}\)**:
   - The expression \(\frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2}\) simplifies to \( t + 2 \) for all \( t \neq 2 \).
   - At \( t = 2 \), the function is undefined because it results in division by zero.
   - However, as \( t \) approaches 2 from either side, the value of \( t + 2 \) approaches 4. Thus, \(\lim_{t \to 2} \frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2} = 4\).

4. **Piecewise Functions**:
   - You introduced a piecewise function where \( f(t) = \frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2} \) for \( t \neq 2 \), and \( f(t) = 3 \) at \( t = 2 \).
   - The limit as \( t \to 2 \) is still determined by the behavior of the function around \( t = 2\), not its value at \( t = 2 \). Thus, \(\lim_{t \to 2} f(t) = 4\).

5. **Key Point**:
   - The limit concerns the values that a function approaches as inputs get arbitrarily close to some point, not necessarily the value of the function at that point.
   - A function can be defined at a point with a different value than the limit approaching it.

### Conclusion

Your explanation effectively illustrates how limits work, especially in cases involving discontinuities or piecewise definitions. The key takeaway is that the limit depends on the behavior of the function as it approaches a point, not necessarily its value at that point. This distinction is crucial in calculus and helps understand more complex concepts like continuity and differentiability.
