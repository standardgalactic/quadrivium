The text explores numerical methods for approximating functions and solving differential equations, focusing on errors involved in these processes. It begins with Taylor series expansions to approximate functions near specific points using derivatives. For instance, using \( y = x^2 \), the first derivative is \( 2x \) and the second derivative is \( 2 \). By setting \( k=1 \) in a Taylor expansion, an error term involving the second derivative is derived.

The discussion then shifts to Euler's method for solving ordinary differential equations. Each step introduces a local truncation error proportional to \( h^2 \), where \( h \) is the step size. As these errors accumulate across steps, they contribute to a global error. The text notes that reducing \( h \) decreases the error significantly; halving \( h \) reduces the error by a factor of four.

However, estimating the exact error is complex due to an unknown point \( c \), which lies between steps in the method. To practically estimate this error, one can assume the worst-case scenario by using the maximum possible value for the derivative term involving \( c \). This provides a conservative, though potentially slightly overestimated, error measure.
