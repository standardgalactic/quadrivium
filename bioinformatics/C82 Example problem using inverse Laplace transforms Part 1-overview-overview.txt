The text outlines a method for solving the motion of coupled masses on springs using differential equations. Here's a summary of the approach:

### System Setup

1. **Equations of Motion**:
   - Two masses, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), are connected by springs with spring constant \( k \).
   - The differential equations describe the forces on each mass due to the springs.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Initial positions: \( x_1(0) = 0 \), \( x_2(0) = 0 \)
   - Initial velocities: \( \dot{x}_1(0) = 1 \), \( \dot{x}_2(0) = 0 \)

### Laplace Transform

- The Laplace transform converts the differential equations into algebraic ones, making them easier to solve.
- For mass \( m_1 \):
  \[
  (m_1 s^2 + 2k)X_1(s) - kX_2(s) = m_1
  \]
- For mass \( m_2 \):
  \[
  kX_1(s) - (m_2 s^2 + k)X_2(s) = 0
  \]

### Solving the System

- Solve the second equation for \( X_2(s) \) in terms of \( X_1(s) \):
  \[
  X_2(s) = \frac{k}{m_2 s^2 + k} X_1(s)
  \]
- Substitute this expression into the first equation to solve for \( X_1(s) \):
  \[
  X_1(s) = \frac{m_1 (m_2 s^2 + k)}{(m_1 s^2 + 2k)(m_2 s^2 + k) - k^2}
  \]
- Use \( X_1(s) \) to find \( X_2(s) \):
  \[
  X_2(s) = \frac{k}{m_2 s^2 + k} \cdot \frac{m_1 (m_2 s^2 + k)}{(m_1 s^2 + 2k)(m_2 s^2 + k) - k^2}
  \]

### Inverse Laplace Transform

- Apply the inverse Laplace transform to \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \) to obtain the time-domain solutions \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \).
- This involves using partial fraction decomposition and standard Laplace transform pairs.

This process provides a systematic way to analyze and solve the dynamics of coupled mass-spring systems.

The text refers to a method or calculation that results in determining the positions of masses over time, which is known as obtaining time-domain solutions. This involves analyzing how these positions change and vary with respect to time, likely using mathematical models or equations such as differential equations commonly used in physics for dynamic systems. Such analysis could be relevant in contexts like mechanical vibrations, wave motion, or other physical phenomena where understanding the temporal evolution of a system is crucial.
