The text describes solving an initial value problem for a differential equation where the first derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y} \). The goal is to find an exact solution using given initial conditions.

1. **Separation of Variables**: The equation is manipulated by separating variables: \( y \, dy = -x \, dx \).

2. **Integration**: Integrating both sides results in:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}y^2 = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + c
   \]
   Simplified to:
   \[
   y^2 = -x^2 + 2c
   \]

3. **Rewriting**: By setting \( 2c = C \), the equation becomes:
   \[
   y^2 = C - x^2
   \]

4. **Circle Equation**: Recognizing this as a circle's equation, it is rewritten as:
   \[
   y = \pm \sqrt{C - x^2}
   \]

5. **Applying Initial Condition**: Given the initial condition \( (0.4, -3) \), substitute into the equation to find \( C \):
   \[
   -3 = \sqrt{C - 0.4^2}
   \]
   Solving gives:
   \[
   C = 25
   \]

6. **Selecting Solution**: The circle's equation becomes:
   \[
   y = \pm \sqrt{25 - x^2}
   \]
   Since the initial condition is at a negative \( y \)-value, choose:
   \[
   y = -\sqrt{25 - x^2}
   \]

7. **Final Solution**: The specific solution satisfying the initial condition is:
   \[
   y = -\sqrt{25 - x^2}
   \] 

This ensures the solution meets the initial value \( (0.4, -3) \).

The text describes solving an initial value problem for a differential equation where the first derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) is given by:

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}. \]

To solve this, the variables are separated and integrated, resulting in:

\[ y^2 = c_1 - x^2. \]

This can be rewritten as a family of solutions representing circles:

\[ y = \pm \sqrt{c - x^2}, \]

where \( c \) is an arbitrary constant.

Given an initial condition \( (x_0, y_0) = (-4, -3) \), the equation becomes:

\[ -3 = \sqrt{c - 16}. \]

Squaring both sides yields:

\[ 9 = c - 16, \]

so \( c = 25 \). This gives a specific circle with the equation:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = 25. \]

The initial condition lies on the lower semicircle, so the solution is:

\[ y = -\sqrt{25 - x^2}. \]

This ensures that the point \( (-4, -3) \) satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.
