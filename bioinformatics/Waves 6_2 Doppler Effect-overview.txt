To solve these Doppler effect problems, we need to understand how frequencies change when sources and observers move relative to each other. Here's a breakdown for each scenario you described:

### 1. **Sumo Wrestler and Referee**

- **Given:**
  - Original frequency (\( f_0 \)) = 500 Hz
  - Speed of sound (\( v \)) = 343 m/s
  - Speed of the referee (\( v_r \)) = 5 m/s (towards the source)
  - Speed of the sumo wrestler (\( v_s \)) = 1 m/s (away from the referee)

- **Step 1: Referee hears the sound**
  - The referee is moving towards the stationary source, so we use:
  \[
  f' = f_0 \left(\frac{v + v_r}{v}\right)
  \]
  \[
  f' = 500 \left(\frac{343 + 5}{343}\right) \approx 507.3 \text{ Hz}
  \]

- **Step 2: Sound reflects off the sumo wrestler**
  - The sumo is moving away from the source of the reflected sound, so:
  \[
  f'' = f' \left(\frac{v}{v + v_s}\right)
  \]
  \[
  f'' = 507.3 \left(\frac{343}{343 + 1}\right) \approx 506.8 \text{ Hz}
  \]

- **Step 3: Referee hears the reflected sound**
  - The referee is moving towards the source of the reflected sound:
  \[
  f''' = f'' \left(\frac{v + v_r}{v}\right)
  \]
  \[
  f''' = 506.8 \left(\frac{343 + 5}{343}\right) \approx 514.1 \text{ Hz}
  \]

### 2. **Burglar Alarm**

- **Given:**
  - Original frequency (\( f_0 \)) = 28,000 Hz
  - Speed of sound (\( v \)) = 343 m/s
  - Speed of intruder (\( v_i \)) = 0.95 m/s (away from the source)

- **Step 1: Intruder hears the original sound**
  - The intruder is moving away:
  \[
  f' = f_0 \left(\frac{v}{v + v_i}\right)
  \]
  \[
  f' = 28000 \left(\frac{343}{343 + 0.95}\right) \approx 27922 \text{ Hz}
  \]

- **Step 2: Reflected sound from the intruder**
  - Now, the intruder is the source moving away:
  \[
  f'' = f' \left(\frac{v}{v + v_i}\right)
  \]
  \[
  f'' = 27922 \left(\frac{343}{343 + 0.95}\right) \approx 27845 \text{ Hz}
  \]

- **Beat Frequency:**
  - The beat frequency is the difference between the original and reflected frequencies:
  \[
  f_{\text{beat}} = |f_0 - f''|
  \]
  \[
  f_{\text{beat}} = |28000 - 27845| = 155 \text{ Hz}
  \]

These calculations show how the Doppler effect influences perceived frequencies when sources and observers are in motion.
