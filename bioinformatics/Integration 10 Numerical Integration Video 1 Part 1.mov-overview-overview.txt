The text describes numerical integration techniques for estimating the area under a curve when an antiderivative cannot be expressed using elementary functions. It focuses on three methods:

1. **Riemann Sums**: This method approximates the area by dividing it into rectangles of equal width, with heights determined by function values at either left or right endpoints.

2. **Trapezoidal Sums**: An improvement over Riemann sums, this approach uses trapezoids instead of rectangles, averaging areas from both left and right endpoint evaluations to better approximate the curve.

3. **Simpson's Sums** (mentioned but not detailed): This technique fits parabolas to segments of the curve for even more accurate approximations.

As the number of subdivisions increases (i.e., as \(\Delta x\) approaches zero), these methods provide increasingly precise estimates, eventually converging to the exact integral value.
