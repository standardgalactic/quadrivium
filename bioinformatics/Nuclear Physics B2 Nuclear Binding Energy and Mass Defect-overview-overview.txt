The text provides insights into calculating nuclear binding energy per nucleon for mercury-202 and explores related physics concepts through examples:

1. **Binding Energy Calculation for Mercury-202:**
   - The atomic mass of mercury-202 is 201.970617 atomic mass units (u).
   - To calculate the binding energy, consider breaking it down into its protons and neutrons: 80 protons and 122 neutrons.
   - Use the atomic masses of hydrogen (1.007825 u) for protons and 1.008665 u for neutrons to determine the total mass of these particles.
   - Subtract this total from the actual mass of mercury-202 to find the binding energy in atomic mass units.
   - Convert this binding energy into mega electron volts (MeV) using the conversion factor \(1 \text{ u} = 931.5 \text{ MeV}/c^2\).
   - Divide by the number of nucleons (202) to get an approximate binding energy per nucleon of 7.90 MeV.

2. **Example Problem with a Falling Rock:**
   - A rock weighing 245 kg falls into a mine shaft 4,200 meters deep.
   - Calculate the change in gravitational potential energy using \( \Delta PE = mg\Delta y \).
   - The energy loss is approximately \(1.0 \times 10^7\) joules.
   - Using Einstein's equation \(E=mc^2\), determine the mass equivalent of this energy loss, resulting in a change in mass of about \(1.1 \times 10^{-10}\) kg for the Earth-rock system.

3. **Binding Energy for Removing Nucleons:**
   - Discusses the binding energies involved in removing one neutron or proton from nitrogen-14.
   - Calculations show that it requires more energy to remove a proton (7.55 MeV) than a neutron (10.55 MeV), indicating protons are more tightly bound.

The text underscores nuclear binding energy concepts, complemented by an analogy with gravitational potential energy changes, illustrating the principles of mass-energy equivalence and nuclear stability.
