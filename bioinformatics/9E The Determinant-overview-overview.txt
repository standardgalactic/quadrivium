The provided text offers an overview of key properties and calculations involving determinants in linear algebra:

1. **Triangular Matrices**: The determinant is the product of the diagonal elements for triangular (upper, lower, or diagonal) matrices.
   
2. **Zero Rows/Columns**: A matrix with a row or column entirely made up of zeros has a zero determinant.

3. **Transpose Property**: The determinant remains unchanged when a matrix is transposed: det(A^T) = det(A).

4. **Proportional Rows/Columns**: If rows or columns are proportional, the determinant is zero.

5. **Scalar Multiplication**: For an n x n matrix multiplied by scalar k, its determinant becomes \(k^n \times \text{det}(A)\).

6. **Inverse Matrix**: The determinant of a matrix's inverse is the reciprocal of the original determinant: det(A^(-1)) = 1/det(A).

7. **Matrix Powers**: The determinant of a matrix raised to power p is \((\text{det}(A))^p\).

8. **Elementary Row Operations**:
   - Swapping two rows/columns changes the sign.
   - Adding a multiple of one row/column to another leaves the determinant unchanged.
   - Multiplying a row/column by a scalar multiplies the determinant by that scalar.

An example illustrates these principles: Starting with a 3x3 matrix A with det(A) = 4, after specific transformations such as row interchanges and scalars multiplication, the determinant becomes -12. Further changes in an element of another matrix yield a determinant of -24 due to systematic documentation of each step.

The text emphasizes careful tracking of modifications to understand their impact on determinants and encourages exploring various transformation outcomes, though it primarily uses one example for illustration.
