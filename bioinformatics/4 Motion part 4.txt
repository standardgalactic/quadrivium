so let's have a quick look at linear momentum so I just want to show you quickly how to do this
it's very simple I think let's start down here we just see linear momentum that's just a scalar
times a vector that's mass times velocity that gives us linear momentum and we know velocity
is the first derivative of position so if mass stays constant now if you think of a rocket
with a chemical type fuel going up the mass of that rocket is going to change over time
so that mass becomes a function of time but if mass stays the same mass is just a scalar linear
momentum is just mass times velocity so let's have this vector up here we make a position vector it's
the cosine of three t in the c coordinate system in the x direction and and sine of t in the y
direction and then the v of t the computer variable v of t assists my r of t its first derivative with
respect to c in that cartesian coordinate system and let's just run that and indeed we get negative
three sine of three times t plus the cosine of t in these in the c coordinate system in the x and y
directions just going to introduce variable m there as a mathematical symbol and if I now we're just
to say p of t is now m times the v of t quite simply the m is just multiplied into both coordinates
there so it's the scalar times a vector no problem just to show you that you can also just write m times
the r of t diff t of c of course you're just going to get the exact same answer no problem there let's
go on to something much more interesting angular momentum it is the cross product between the
position vector and the linear momentum vector so it's usually written as capital l that's angular
momentum in time and is the cross product of the position vector and momentum vector or then the
position vector and the mass times the first derivative of the position vector now how do you do these
cross products i'm going to show you quickly let's create two simple vectors i'm going to have x1 and
x direction y1 y direction and p2 there's x2 and y2 in the x and the y directions if we run that and i take
the cross product of p1 and p2 if i run that there you see the cross product of two you'll see that's only
in the z direction it's x1 y2 minus x2 y1 so that's easy enough we've seen before how to do the cross
product but just let's just scale things up a bit let me just show you if i were to make a matrix x1 y1
x2 y2 which is just combining these two vectors up there but i make it i make it into matrix form
and i take the determinant i take the determinant of that matrix remember that's x1 y2 minus x2 y1
if i run that off we go that's where you get x1 y2 minus x sub 2 y sub 1 that's the determinant
now what about scaling things up to three dimensions if i were to run that i'm just showing you i've got
this so what i do with my two vectors which are now in three dimensions x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 i put a
i j and k for my x y and z directions on the top and i get the determinant of this look at this if i
were to run that and i get the determinant of that now it's not going to um split things up nicely for
you but you see there's a i there and there's a i there so in the i direction we have y sub 1 z sub 2
minus y sub 2 z sub 1 there's the next two in the j direction and the last two in the k direction
now here's the exact same two x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 vectors and i take their cross product
and lo and behold you'll notice that that the determinant and the cross product there is the
exact same thing and so my c coordinate system sub x there that's i there's my j and there's my k and
you'll note that the two is exactly the same so to take the cross product you you just write it in this
form with i j and k at the top you take the determinant of that that would be the same as the cross product
so let's do the cross product between the r of t and p of t of our example above if i were just to
run that let me hold three times the mass of sine of t times sine of three times t and the rest there
all in the z direction so this angular momentum of two vectors in the plane will point perpendicularly
away in the z direction what is torque well there we have the equation for linear momentum we start off
where that's r cross p if i take the first derivative of that that's going to be a r prime of t
times now look at the second one
just the product rule of the cross product of two vectors this is the product rule as per normal
so i'm taking the first derivative of the first factor there multiple cross product the second one plus
the first one cross product the sec the derivative of the second one so it's just that at the front
here we have r prime of t and cross product r prime of t remember if you take the cross product of two
of two vectors similar vectors or even though this one's multiplied by a scalar that is zero because
remember you multiply it by the sine of the angle between them sine of zero is zero so that term first
cross product there is going to fall away so we have that the rate of change of linear momentum so
imagine something is spinning and i wanted to spin faster or slower i have to apply torque to it
if i apply torque that would be analogous to applying a force in a linear fashion for linear motion
here i'm going to apply a twisting force that's called torque and that's going to give me a rate of
change in my angular momentum it's going to spin faster or slower so that rate of change in angular
momentum in other words torque equals r cross m r double prime of t we know that force equals m r double
prime of t force equals mass times acceleration in other words torque is the cross product of the
position vector and the force vector so we're looking actually at the the orthogonal component of one
multiplied by the other one because it is the if we're just looking at magnitudes it's the magnitude of
this times the magnitude of the second one times the sine of the angle between them
we want the maximum of that the maximum would be sine of 90 degrees or pi over two radians
so if i were just to run it on the example we had above where the l of
we had the angular momentum there if i take its first derivative
with respect to t in the c i'm going to get eight times the mass eight times the mass times the sine of t
times the cosine of three t in the z direction again in the z direction um a of t time if i just look at
acceleration that will just be the v of t diff and if i let f be m times a of course i'm going to get the
force that was that if i cross r of t and f as i do there i'm going to get
this exactly the same as up there l of t prime and the cross product r of t if it's exactly the
same i can test this with a boolean is lt prime equal equal that means is it equal to it's going to evaluate
that the cross if i run that the boolean value is going to return true so i can do the cross product
or i can just take the first derivative of the angular momentum i'm going to leave this last
bit it's quite a bit of fun i'm not going to do a lecture on it i'm just going to leave it
in the notebook you can run through it if you just launch something initially you can look at
all newton's equations you're going to end up with this position vector here and you can answer a lot
of questions if you were to have this position vector to start off with good
