The text outlines a method for solving a system of autonomous differential equations using Python and the SymPy library. The system consists of two equations with unknowns \(x\) and \(y\):

\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = 5x + y \]
\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = -2x + 3y \]

The solution involves calculating eigenvalues (\(4-i\) and \(4+i\)) and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix. These lead to real components used in constructing solutions:

- **Eigenvalues**: \(\alpha = 4\), \(\beta = -1\)
- **Real part**: \([-5, 1]\)
- **Imaginary part**: \([5, 0]\)

The general solution is expressed with exponential terms involving the eigenvalues:

\[ x(t) = c_1 e^{4t} (\sin t - \cos t) + c_2 e^{4t} (\sin t + \cos t) \]
\[ y(t) = 2c_1 e^{4t} \cos t \]

Given initial conditions \(x(0) = -1\) and \(y(0) = 2\), the constants \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are determined by solving:

\[ -\frac{1}{2}c_1 + \frac{1}{2}c_2 = -1 \]
\[ c_1 - c_2 = 2 \]

The solutions for these constants are \(c_1 = 2\) and \(c_2 = 0\), leading to specific solutions:

\[ x(t) = e^{4t} (\sin t - \cos t) \]
\[ y(t) = 2e^{4t} \cos t \]

The text emphasizes that this method provides an analytical solution. A plot is generated using Matplotlib to visualize these solutions over time, highlighting the behavior of the system.

It notes that while initial plots demonstrate smooth curves, extending the time scale (e.g., from 4 to 10) results in significant curvature changes and increased computational time, indicating inefficiency at larger scales. Observations suggest limiting analysis to smaller time intervals (e.g., up to 1) for more meaningful insights and avoiding overly complex visualizations or large value computations that are not useful for analysis.
