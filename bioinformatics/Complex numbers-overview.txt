The lecture introduces the concept of complex numbers by building on the previously discussed imaginary unit \( i \), defined such that \( i^2 = -1 \). Complex numbers are represented as a set, denoted by the double-struck letter \( \mathbb{C} \).

A complex number is expressed in the form \( a + bi \) or alternatively \( x + iy \), where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) (or \( x \) and \( y \)) are real numbers.
- The imaginary unit \( i \) satisfies \( i^2 = -1 \).

This form shows that complex numbers consist of a "real part" (\( a \) or \( x \)) and an "imaginary part" (\( b \) or \( y \)), with the latter multiplied by \( i \). The set of real numbers is considered a subset of complex numbers, where any number can be viewed as having its imaginary component equal to zero (e.g., \( 3 + 0i = 3 \)).

The lecture also mentions that different variables, such as \( z \) or \( w \), are commonly used to denote complex numbers. Additionally, the real and imaginary units themselves (\( 1 \) and \( i \)) can be viewed as specific complex numbers where one part is zero.

Overall, complex numbers form an algebraic structure called a field, sharing properties like commutativity, allowing for flexible notation interchangeably using different variables without loss of generality.

The text discusses how to express a complex number \( z \) in terms of its real and imaginary components. A complex number can be written as \( z = a + bi \), where:

- The real part is denoted by \( \text{Re}(z) = a \).
- The imaginary part is represented by \( \text{Im}(z) = b \).

Here, \( a \) and \( b \) are both real numbers, with \( i \) being the imaginary unit satisfying \( i^2 = -1 \). Although often referred to as "imaginary," these components have practical uses across various fields of study. The notation emphasizes viewing complex numbers as combinations of real parts and multiplication by the imaginary unit \( i \), making it straightforward to understand their construction and operations like addition and multiplication.
