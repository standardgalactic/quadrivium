The lecture introduces the concept of complex numbers by building on the previously discussed imaginary unit \( i \), defined such that \( i^2 = -1 \). Complex numbers are represented as a set, denoted by the double-struck letter \( \mathbb{C} \).

A complex number is expressed in the form \( a + bi \) or alternatively \( x + iy \), where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) (or \( x \) and \( y \)) are real numbers.
- The imaginary unit \( i \) satisfies \( i^2 = -1 \).

This form shows that complex numbers consist of a "real part" (\( a \) or \( x \)) and an "imaginary part" (\( b \) or \( y \)), with the latter multiplied by \( i \). The set of real numbers is considered a subset of complex numbers, where any number can be viewed as having its imaginary component equal to zero (e.g., \( 3 + 0i = 3 \)).

The lecture also mentions that different variables, such as \( z \) or \( w \), are commonly used to denote complex numbers. Additionally, the real and imaginary units themselves (\( 1 \) and \( i \)) can be viewed as specific complex numbers where one part is zero.

Overall, complex numbers form an algebraic structure called a field, sharing properties like commutativity, allowing for flexible notation interchangeably using different variables without loss of generality.

The text discusses how to express a complex number \( z \) in terms of its real and imaginary components. A complex number can be written as \( z = a + bi \), where:

- The real part is denoted by \( \text{Re}(z) = a \).
- The imaginary part is represented by \( \text{Im}(z) = b \).

Here, \( a \) and \( b \) are both real numbers, with \( i \) being the imaginary unit satisfying \( i^2 = -1 \). Although often referred to as "imaginary," these components have practical uses across various fields of study. The notation emphasizes viewing complex numbers as combinations of real parts and multiplication by the imaginary unit \( i \), making it straightforward to understand their construction and operations like addition and multiplication.

In this lecture on complex numbers, the discussion begins by revisiting the imaginary unit \(i\), which is defined such that \(i^2 = -1\). The focus then shifts to defining the set of complex numbers, denoted as \(\mathbb{C}\) (a double-struck C symbol), analogous to how real numbers are represented.

A complex number is expressed in the form \(z = a + bi\) or alternatively as \(x + yi\), where both \(a\) and \(b\) (or \(x\) and \(y\)) are real numbers. Here, multiplication by the imaginary unit \(i\) does not require an explicit symbol like \(\times\) due to the commutative property of multiplication in fields.

The complex number can be written using variables typically denoted as \(z\) or sometimes \(w\), with \(x\) and \(y\) often reserved for real numbers. The variable \(z = a + bi\) represents any complex number, where \(a\) is referred to as the real part of \(z\).

The lecture highlights that real numbers are special cases of complex numbers when the imaginary part (\(b\) or \(y\)) is zero. For instance, the complex number \(3 + 0i\) simplifies to just the real number 3. Conversely, the imaginary unit \(i\) itself can be viewed as a complex number \(0 + i\).

In summary, the lecture provides an introduction to complex numbers by defining their structure, demonstrating their relation to real numbers, and introducing terminology such as the real part of a complex number.

The text explains how to express a complex number \( z \) in terms of its real and imaginary components. A complex number is typically written as \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) is the real part (\(\text{Re}(z)\)) and \( b \) is the imaginary part (\(\text{Im}(z)\)). The notation uses an uppercase "R" for the real part, followed by lowercase "e," and an uppercase "I" with lowercase "m" for the imaginary part.

The text emphasizes that while these terms are called "real" and "imaginary," there's nothing fantastical about them; they have practical applications across various fields. Both \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers, which allows us to construct complex numbers simply using addition and multiplication by the imaginary unit \( i \), where \( i^2 = -1 \). This framework is fundamental in understanding how complex numbers function mathematically.
