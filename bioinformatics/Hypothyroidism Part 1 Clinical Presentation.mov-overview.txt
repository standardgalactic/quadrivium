Hypothyroidism is a prevalent endocrine disorder caused by issues within the thyroid gland itself or related controlling mechanisms in the pituitary and hypothalamus. It affects women more frequently than men, with incidence increasing with age; up to 15% of older women experience subclinical hypothyroidism. The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of hypothyroidism.

Metabolically, patients often suffer from cold intolerance due to decreased metabolic rates and oxygen consumption. Despite reduced appetite, they may gain weight because of water retention, salt accumulation, and fat buildup, linked to decreased lipolysis and protein turnover causing myopathy and weakness. Elevated LDL cholesterol and homocysteine levels increase coronary artery disease risk.

Physiologically, hypothyroid patients can experience hyponatremia in severe cases due to water retention, reduced exercise tolerance from a slower heart rate and lower myocardial contractility, and higher diastolic pressure. Electrocardiograms may show low voltages related to pericardial and pleural effusions. The skin becomes dry, pale, yellowish, with non-pitting edema primarily in the pre-tibial area due to extracellular matrix protein accumulation.

Patients might exhibit mental slowing, memory loss, and reduced deep tendon reflex relaxation phase; functional imaging shows decreased cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. Severe respiratory muscle weakness can lead to hypoventilation. Constipation is common due to slowed small bowel motor activity. Autoimmune-related hypothyroidism increases pernicious anemia and gastric atrophy risk.

In primary hypothyroidism, mild serum prolactin increases may contribute to miscarriage risks in pregnant women or menstrual irregularities in non-pregnant ones, affecting fertility. Men see reduced testosterone levels due to decreased sex hormone-binding globulin. The discussion will further explore hypothyroidism causes and subclinical cases in subsequent content.
