Hypothyroidism is a prevalent endocrine disorder caused by issues within the thyroid gland itself or related controlling mechanisms in the pituitary and hypothalamus. It affects women more frequently than men, with incidence increasing with age; up to 15% of older women experience subclinical hypothyroidism. The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of hypothyroidism.

Metabolically, patients often suffer from cold intolerance due to decreased metabolic rates and oxygen consumption. Despite reduced appetite, they may gain weight because of water retention, salt accumulation, and fat buildup, linked to decreased lipolysis and protein turnover causing myopathy and weakness. Elevated LDL cholesterol and homocysteine levels increase coronary artery disease risk.

Physiologically, hypothyroid patients can experience hyponatremia in severe cases due to water retention, reduced exercise tolerance from a slower heart rate and lower myocardial contractility, and higher diastolic pressure. Electrocardiograms may show low voltages related to pericardial and pleural effusions. The skin becomes dry, pale, yellowish, with non-pitting edema primarily in the pre-tibial area due to extracellular matrix protein accumulation.

Patients might exhibit mental slowing, memory loss, and reduced deep tendon reflex relaxation phase; functional imaging shows decreased cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. Severe respiratory muscle weakness can lead to hypoventilation. Constipation is common due to slowed small bowel motor activity. Autoimmune-related hypothyroidism increases pernicious anemia and gastric atrophy risk.

In primary hypothyroidism, mild serum prolactin increases may contribute to miscarriage risks in pregnant women or menstrual irregularities in non-pregnant ones, affecting fertility. Men see reduced testosterone levels due to decreased sex hormone-binding globulin. The discussion will further explore hypothyroidism causes and subclinical cases in subsequent content.

Hypothyroidism is a prevalent endocrine disorder caused by various defects affecting thyroid function, pituitary control mechanisms, or peripheral cell receptors. It leads to reduced activity of T3 hormone, affecting metabolism and numerous bodily functions. More common in women—about ten times more than men—and its incidence rises with age; up to 15% of older women experience at least subclinical hypothyroidism.

The clinical symptoms' severity depends on the extent of hypothyroidism but exhibit significant individual variations. Metabolically, patients experience cold intolerance due to a lower metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, reduced appetite but weight gain from water/salt retention and fat accumulation. Fat accumulation arises from decreased lipolysis, while reduced protein turnover leads to myopathy and weakness.

Hypothyroidism increases the risk of coronary artery disease due to elevated LDL cholesterol and homocysteine levels. Patients often have increased serum creatinine, hyponatremia in profound cases, high diastolic pressure, low heart rate, and decreased myocardial contractility, all contributing to reduced exercise tolerance.

ECG might show low voltages partially caused by pericardial and pleural effusions from water retention. The skin becomes dry, pale, yellowish with non-pitting edema, especially in the pre-tibial region, along with coarse hair that is brittle due to extracellular matrix protein accumulation. Reduced sweating is also noted.

Cognitive effects include sleepiness, slowed thought processes, and memory loss, attributed to reduced cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. Clinically, a reduction in deep tendon reflexes relaxation phase can indicate hypothyroidism. Severe cases may lead to hypoventilation due to respiratory muscle weakness.

Digestively, patients experience constipation from decreased small bowel motility. Autoimmune-related hypothyroidism increases the risk of pernicious anemia and gastric atrophy. Primary hypothyroidism slightly raises serum prolactin levels, which can cause menstrual irregularities and increased miscarriage risks in pregnant women, thus affecting fertility.

In men, reduced sex hormone binding globulin leads to decreased testosterone levels. The discussion on causes of hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism will follow in the next segment.
