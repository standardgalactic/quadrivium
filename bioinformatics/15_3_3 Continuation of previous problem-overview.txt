The text describes solving a line integral with respect to \( y \). The differential \( dy \) is given by \( 2t + 1 \), which simplifies to \( 2 \, dt \). The integral is evaluated from 0 to 1 for the expression \( (2t^2 + 2 + t) \cdot 2 \, dt \). By factoring out the constant 2, the integral becomes \( 2 \times \int (2t^2 + 2 + t) \, dt \), which results in \( 7/3 \) after calculation.

The text describes the process of evaluating a line integral with respect to \( y \). The derivative \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) is calculated and found to be \( 2t + 1 \), which simplifies to 2. This leads to setting up an integral from 0 to 1 for the expression \( 2(2t^2 + 2 + t) \, dt \). Since 2 is a constant, it can be factored out, resulting in the integral of \( (2t^2 + 2 + t) \, dt \), which evaluates to \( \frac{7}{3} \) after multiplying by 2.
