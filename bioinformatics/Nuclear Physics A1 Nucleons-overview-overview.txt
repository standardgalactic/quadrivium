The text explores fundamental concepts related to atomic nuclei and subatomic particles, focusing on electrons, protons, neutrons (nucleons), and isotopes. It explains how elements are represented by their atomic number (Z) for protons and atomic mass number (A) as the sum of protons and neutrons, using carbon isotopes (\(^{12}\text{C}\) and \(^{13}\text{C}\)) as examples.

Protons and neutrons, discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick, are discussed in terms of their roles and masses. The neutron is slightly heavier due to its quark composition. The text describes how the nucleus's radius can be estimated using a formula involving \(1.2 \times 10^{-15}\) meters and notes that nuclear density remains constant across different elements.

The concept of isotopes is clarified: they share the same atomic number but vary in neutron count. Key questions explore topics like electron numbers, nuclear charges, densities, and radii.

The discussion transitions to fundamental forces, emphasizing the strong nuclear force's role in maintaining nuclear stability by overcoming electrostatic repulsion between protons. This force operates over short distances, with its strength significantly surpassing gravitational forces at this scale. As atomic mass increases, more neutrons are required for stability, as demonstrated by bismuth being the largest completely stable nucleus.

The text concludes that while strong nuclear force effectively binds nucleons within a short range, beyond this distance, electrostatic repulsion becomes dominant, leading to instability in larger nuclei like uranium. This underscores the crucial and distinctive nature of the strong nuclear force in atomic structure.
