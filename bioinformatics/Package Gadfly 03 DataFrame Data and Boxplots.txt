so let's get to plot some data now I'm going to import the data frames package and from that we
have this read table now I do have video material on the data frames package you can also watch the
first of our mini projects which was on medical statistics just to have a look at the data frames
package I'm going to just run through it without explaining much there is a csv file that lives
right in the folder that I'm working with there it is ccs.csv a comma separated value file and I'm
going to import it as a data frame with the read table function and I'm going to import that into
this computer variable that I just call df let's do that it'll take a while just to import that there
we go and let's look at the tail of that data frame and that's going to print out to the screen
for us the last few rows so we see we have the following patient there seems to be up to patient
number 200 gender we have the ages and then we have variable 1 variable 2 variable 3 and 4 and category
1 which seems to be a's and b's category 2 which seems to be c x and r's and category 3 which seems
to have p and r values when we're only seeing the last six row entries of this spreadsheet to this
common separated value file which is now a data frame and I do that using this tail function I can
look at all of these columns and I can just look at the type of data that they contain I see the patient
column see all the list of columns there and the patient is integer 64 data type the gender seems
to be a string the age and int is 64 but integer variable 64 but float variable 2 seems to be an
integer variable 3 a float variable 4 an integer and then strings and we see that we have no missing
values very quickly I'm not going to explain much we can just get these descriptive statistics describe
the data frame open and close square brackets colon gender that refers to the column name and we see it
has length of 200 again it's all strings there are no no empty or missing values there and we and we see it
it finds two unique entries and I can check what those are by writing this by function it takes the
arguments data frame the column and then it inserts this new variable called d such that we create this
data frame with a new column name in and it takes the arguments the sign of size of whatever it finds
let me show you what that means remember it said it found two unique types of entries in the gender
column and indeed it found an f and an m and the n counts the size of that found 100 instances of f and
100 instances of m so there we go we can describe the age column and now the reason why I put it out
here is once we start plotting so that you can see if we do box plots you're going to see the mean of 46
on those graphs so describe just gives the summary stats of mean median 25th percentile 50th percentile
the third quartile which is the 75th percentile maximum which is the fourth quartile or 100th percentile
and we can do go through age we can do through variable one we can go through variable two variable
three it's all pretty self-explanatory and we see variable four there now remember we get to category
and it's going to tell us again that it finds 200 entries no missing values it's a string data type
sorry no missing values and it finds two unique entries and by writing this by function I can create
a new small little data frame which will tell me it found a and b and again 100 instances of each
let's just look at category two it found three unique entries and I can just look at what those are and
how many they are now this is important to be able to do because if we're going to do box plots we just
counts it needs this pre-compile information it needs to know that there is this so you will construct
a bar plot from this new data frame that you create here from the data frame you won't be able to count
the instances in get fly itself let's look at category category three there we see it and again the unique
entries and it found p q and an r 90 p's 44 q's and 66 instances of r so let's do our first bit of
plotting a box plot again we have imported we have imported get fly so we can just use the plot function
but it is data aware so I can just pass it the computer variable that I use to to for my data frame
I call the df so I can refer to df now for my aesthetics I can say well look down the gender column
and for the x-axis so remember that was categorical data so it was going to do one box plot of f and one
box plot of m and what do I want these box plot values to be of well for my y-axis look at the age column
the geometry that I want you to do with this aesthetic is the box plot geometry
comma and I'm going to give it a guide dot title we've looked at that and a guide dot x label which
is gender so let's run that code and see our very first box plot
and there's beautiful deep sky blue box plots as I told you it found two unique entries female and
male and a chart there we have our median we saw before what it was when we just looked at our
descriptive statistics and we have these beautiful little box plots now I can play around with them
in with themes arguments for the theme function again remember the theme there so again plot
that's data data frame aware so I pass it the data frame argument x is this agenda this time y is age
just as we had before geom dot box plot box plot geometry I'm adding the same title and x-axis label
and but you see it would also do it automatically we did not specify the y label but it took the column
name age and it attached that to the y label itself so theme the first argument I'm going to use is box
plot space box plot spacing underscore spacing and I'm going to put it at 100 pixels so that's the spacing
between these two box plots my grid color I'm going to do color and white again and the default color
there's another argument that it takes and that's going to change this color this deep sky blue to
something else and I'm just using hexadecimal code here so hashtag a a a a a a a so you know it's going
to be a bit of a green and last thing I'm going to do is the middle width that's this line the median
line for the two I can change that as well so look how beautiful the this new plot of mine is going to be
that looks brilliant I've changed the color to this gray I've thickened this line up I've made them
smaller by increasing this box plot spacing in between those two so let's play a bit more with
this box plot let's pass something else we're going to pass the data frame for x we're going to pass
category three for y we're going to do variable two the geometry on this aesthetic comes from the box plot
box plot geometry I'm going to add a title box plot of variable two values for category three groups
I just give that a name my x-axis is category three groups I don't pass y because this is going to say
variable two but I could pass a guide dot y label let's play around with the theme I'm going to give it a
default color of orange we know how to do that the grid color I want white so I don't see those
little gray lines now I'm introducing something grid color focused I think we had had a look at it
before actually it's just when you mouse over that you don't see that so I'm changing that to white as
well the box plots box plot spacing is 80 pixels this time and here's something new default default point
size because there are going to be I'm telling you now I know for a fact because I created that csv file
that there are some statistical outliers and I can give them a default point size I'm going to make
that seven pixel now look at this beautiful graph so all constructed there that is that is aesthetically
pleasing shall I use that term so there's my title y-axis was grabbed from the column name x-axis I
actually entered some string value there that I wanted and look the color is nice and orange I've
got this nice spacing in between making my box plots a bit smaller if I mouse over the grid is gone
it's not gone it's white and then look at these statistical outliers with quite large little dots
so that looks beautiful now I can add another dimension to my box plot data and that is going to
be done by this y group so this was all just category three but I can add another group so let's do
exactly the same so or let's at least say category one for my x axis instead of category three we had
three there let's use category one variable two still but I'm going to add this new argument called
y group and that's gender so it's going to do these two rows of box plot for box plots for me because
they're two unique entries for gender and then I've got to use a special I've got to use a special
geometry called geom.subplot grid so I've got to use that and inside of that I pass the argument
geom.box plot because I want those to be box plots next argument theme and it takes its own set of
arguments remember and what are we going to use here as default color we're going to make it orange again
grid color white grid color focused also white let's just see so it's just adding this extra
dimension to our data let's have a look at it wait for two to render and there we go so it says variable
two by gender it added that for me and it found female and male and category one it had two unique
entries a and b and it takes variable two and it makes all these little box plots for you so just
adding that extra dimension by this y group good in the next section we get to start looking at
density plots and histograms followed by some of violin plots
