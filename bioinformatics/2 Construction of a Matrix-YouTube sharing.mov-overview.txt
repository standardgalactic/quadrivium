The text explains how to construct an augmented matrix from a system of linear equations. An augmented matrix represents these equations and includes both the coefficients of the variables and the constants from each equation.

Here's a step-by-step summary:

1. **Matrix Dimensions**: 
   - The number of rows, \( M \), corresponds to the number of equations.
   - The number of columns, \( N + 1 \), equals the number of unknowns plus one additional column for the constants (answers).

2. **Constructing the Matrix**:
   - Each row represents an equation.
   - The first \( N \) columns contain coefficients of the variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_N \).
   - The last column contains the constant terms from each equation.

3. **Naming Constants**:
   - Constants are named according to their position in the matrix (e.g., row 1, column 1).

4. **Example of Accessing Elements**:
   - To access an element, use its row and column number (e.g., row 2, column 1 refers to the coefficient of \( X_1 \) in the second equation).

The text ends with some unclear instructions or examples related to accessing specific elements within a matrix, which seem to be part of a larger example or exercise.

The text explains how to construct an augmented matrix from a system of linear equations. Here's a summary:

1. **Definition**: An augmented matrix represents a set of linear equations, with rows corresponding to equations and columns to unknowns.

2. **Structure**:
   - The matrix has \( M \) rows for the number of equations.
   - It has \( N + 1 \) columns: \( N \) columns for the coefficients of the \( N \) unknowns (\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_N \)) and an additional column for the constants (answers).

3. **Construction**:
   - Each row corresponds to one equation.
   - The first \( N \) columns contain the coefficients of the respective unknowns in each equation.
   - The last column contains the constant terms from each equation (\( B_1, B_2, ..., B_M \)).

4. **Example**: 
   - For an equation like \( a_{11}X_1 + a_{12}X_2 + ... + a_{1N}X_N = B_1 \), the first row of the matrix would be \([a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1N}, B_1]\).

5. **Naming**:
   - Each coefficient is identified by its position, such as \( a_{ij} \) for the element in the \( i^{th} \) row and \( j^{th} \) column.

The text also includes some unclear phrases and potential typographical errors, but the main focus remains on constructing an augmented matrix from a given system of linear equations.
