The text explains how to construct an augmented matrix from a system of linear equations. An augmented matrix represents these equations and includes both the coefficients of the variables and the constants from each equation.

Here's a step-by-step summary:

1. **Matrix Dimensions**: 
   - The number of rows, \( M \), corresponds to the number of equations.
   - The number of columns, \( N + 1 \), equals the number of unknowns plus one additional column for the constants (answers).

2. **Constructing the Matrix**:
   - Each row represents an equation.
   - The first \( N \) columns contain coefficients of the variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_N \).
   - The last column contains the constant terms from each equation.

3. **Naming Constants**:
   - Constants are named according to their position in the matrix (e.g., row 1, column 1).

4. **Example of Accessing Elements**:
   - To access an element, use its row and column number (e.g., row 2, column 1 refers to the coefficient of \( X_1 \) in the second equation).

The text ends with some unclear instructions or examples related to accessing specific elements within a matrix, which seem to be part of a larger example or exercise.
