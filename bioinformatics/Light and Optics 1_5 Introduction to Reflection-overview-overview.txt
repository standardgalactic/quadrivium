The text explores how images formed by concave and convex mirrors change as an object moves from beyond the center point towards the focal point. For a **convex mirror**, with the center at 1 meter and focal point at 0.5 meters, the image remains upright and virtual regardless of the object's position. Initially small when far away, the image enlarges as it approaches the focal point, eventually appearing to be at infinity.

For a **concave mirror**, placing an object beyond the center (4 meters) results in a smaller real image. As the object moves closer to the central point (1 meter), the image distance increases. At the focal point, the image forms at infinity. Moving past the focal point creates a virtual, upright image on the same side as the object.

An example problem illustrates achieving a magnification of 1/5 by placing an object 0.15 meters from a convex mirror with a radius of curvature of 7.5 centimeters (0.075 meters), confirming its convex nature due to the positive radius.

The text highlights how image characteristics vary based on the position of objects relative to concave and convex mirrors, using specific distance examples and magnification calculations.
