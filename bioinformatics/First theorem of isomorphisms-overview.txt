The text describes a fundamental concept in group theory known as the First Isomorphism Theorem. It starts with an isomorphism \( f \) between two groups \( g \) and \( h \), where each group has its own binary operation. Although these operations may differ, there exists a consistent mapping (isomorphism) between them.

The key steps in the explanation are as follows:

1. **Kernel of the Isomorphism**: The kernel of \( f \), denoted as \(\text{ker}(f)\), consists of all elements in group \( g \) that map to the identity element in group \( h \). It is established that this kernel is a normal subgroup of \( g \).

2. **Cosets and Quotient Groups**: The text discusses forming quotient groups by dividing \( g \) using its kernel, creating sets called cosets.

3. **Surjective and Injective Mapping**: The mapping \( f \) from the quotient group \( g/\text{ker}(f) \) to \( h \) is shown to be surjective (onto). To prove that it's also injective (one-to-one), the text argues that if two elements from different cosets mapped to the same element in \( h \), they must actually belong to the same coset, contradicting their initial assumption.

4. **Bijection and Isomorphism**: By proving both surjectivity and injectivity, it's established that \( f \) is a bijection between the quotient group \( g/\text{ker}(f) \) and \( h \), making them isomorphic.

5. **Conclusion - First Isomorphism Theorem**: The text concludes with stating the First Isomorphism Theorem: if there is an isomorphism between two groups, then the quotient of the first group by the kernel of this isomorphism is itself isomorphic to the second group. This theorem highlights a deep and fundamental relationship in algebraic structures.

The essence of this theorem reveals that the structure of \( g \) modulo its kernel is effectively the same as the structure of \( h \), providing insight into how groups relate through homomorphisms.

The text discusses the concept of group isomorphisms and introduces the First Isomorphism Theorem in group theory. Here's a summary:

1. **Isomorphism Definition**: An isomorphism \( f: g \to h \) between two groups \( g \) and \( h \) means there's a one-to-one correspondence preserving the group operations.

2. **Kernel of Isomorphism**: The kernel of \( f \), denoted as \( \text{ker}(f) \), is the set of elements in \( g \) that map to the identity element in \( h \). It forms a normal subgroup of \( g \).

3. **Cosets and Quotient Group**: The text explains how dividing group \( g \) by its kernel results in cosets, leading to the formation of a quotient group.

4. **Mapping Properties**:
   - **Surjection**: Initially established that the mapping from \( g/\text{ker}(f) \) (quotient group) to \( h \) is surjective.
   - **Injection Proof**: Demonstrates injectivity by showing if two elements map to the same element in \( h \), they must belong to the same coset, thus proving a one-to-one correspondence.

5. **Bijection and Isomorphism**: Combining surjectivity and injectivity results in a bijection between the quotient group \( g/\text{ker}(f) \) and \( h \).

6. **First Isomorphism Theorem**: Concludes that if there's an isomorphism from \( g \) to \( h \), then the quotient group formed by dividing \( g \) by the kernel of this isomorphism is itself isomorphic to \( h \). This result is known as the First Isomorphism Theorem.

This theorem highlights a deep connection between groups, their subgroups, and quotient structures in algebra.
