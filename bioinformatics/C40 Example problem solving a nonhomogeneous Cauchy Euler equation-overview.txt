The text describes solving a non-homogeneous differential equation using variation of parameters. Initially, the equation is converted into its homogeneous form by assuming a trial solution \( y = x^r \), leading to a characteristic equation whose roots are used to construct the complementary solution.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Homogenization**: The given differential equation is transformed into a homogeneous one by identifying the associated homogeneous equation and solving it using standard methods like finding characteristic roots (using \( r(r-1) = 0 \)).

2. **Complementary Solution**: From the characteristic roots, \( r = 0 \) and \( r = 1 \), the complementary solution is formed as \( y_c = c_1 x^0 + c_2 x^1 \), simplifying to \( y_c = c_1 + c_2x \).

3. **Particular Solution via Variation of Parameters**: The particular solution is found using variation of parameters, which involves:
   - Calculating the Wronskian determinant from solutions of the homogeneous equation.
   - Finding functions \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) that satisfy specific integrals derived from the original differential equation's non-homogeneous part.

4. **Integration Process**: The text details integrating to find \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \), using integration by parts where necessary, to solve for these functions explicitly.

5. **Final Solution Construction**: Combining both the complementary solution \( y_c \) and the particular solution \( y_p \) gives the general solution of the original differential equation.

6. **Key Advice**: The text emphasizes converting the non-homogeneous equation into a homogeneous one first, solving it, and then applying standard form transformation to find the particular solution using variation of parameters. This ensures correct identification of the forcing function \( f(x) \) for use in calculating the Wronskian and subsequent integrals.

Overall, the text is an instructional guide on handling second-order linear differential equations with variable coefficients through systematic mathematical techniques.
