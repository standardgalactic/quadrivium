If we view this problem, we'll again see that it's linear, homogeneous, third-order ordinary
differential equation with constant coefficients. We're going to make use of the auxiliary equation
and we can write this as mq plus 3m squared plus 3m plus 1 equals 0 and everyone should be able
to realize that this is m plus 1 cubed equals 0 through binomial expansion. In other words,
m sub 1 equals m sub 2 equals m sub 3 and they're all going to be equal to negative 1. That means
we have an equation or a family of solutions in the form c sub 1 e to the power negative x plus c sub 2
x e to the power negative x plus c sub 3 x squared e to the power negative x.
