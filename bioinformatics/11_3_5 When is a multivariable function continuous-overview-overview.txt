In multivariable calculus, differentiability and the tangent plane are fundamental concepts. The problem involves a function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \), where you need to:

1. Prove that \( f \) is differentiable at \( (1, 1) \).
2. Find the equation of the tangent plane at that point.

### Tangent Plane Equation

The formula for the tangent plane at a point \( (x_0, y_0) \) on the surface \( z = f(x, y) \) is:
\[ 
z = f(x_0, y_0) + (x - x_0)f_x(x_0, y_0) + (y - y_0)f_y(x_0, y_0)
\]
where \( f_x \) and \( f_y \) are the partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( y \).

#### Partial Derivatives

For \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \):
- \( f_x(x, y) = 2x \)
- \( f_y(x, y) = 2y \)

Evaluate at \( (1, 1) \):
- \( f(1, 1) = 2 \)
- \( f_x(1, 1) = 2 \)
- \( f_y(1, 1) = 2 \)

#### Tangent Plane

Substitute into the formula:
\[
z = 2 + (x - 1)(2) + (y - 1)(2)
\]
Simplifying gives:
\[
z = 2x + 2y - 2
\]

### Proving Differentiability

A function is differentiable at a point if it can be approximated by its tangent plane near that point. Formally, for \( f \) to be differentiable at \( (1, 1) \):
\[
\lim_{(h, k) \to (0, 0)} \frac{f(1+h, 1+k) - f(1, 1) - f_x(1, 1)h - f_y(1, 1)k}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = 0
\]

Calculate:
\[
f(1+h, 1+k) = (1+h)^2 + (1+k)^2 = 2 + 2h + 2k + h^2 + k^2
\]

Substitute into the limit expression:
\[
f(1+h, 1+k) - f(1, 1) - 2h - 2k = h^2 + k^2
\]

Evaluate the limit:
\[
\lim_{(h, k) \to (0, 0)} \frac{h^2 + k^2}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0, 0)} \sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = 0
\]

Since the limit is zero, \( f \) is differentiable at \( (1, 1) \).

### Conclusion

The tangent plane to the surface \( z = x^2 + y^2 \) at \( (1, 1) \) is:
\[ 
z = 2x + 2y - 2 
\]
And \( f \) is differentiable at this point.
