The video provides guidance on preparing for a short course hosted by Stellenbosch University, focusing on using R and RStudio for statistical computing.

1. **Installation**:
   - **R**: Download from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) suitable for your OS (Linux, Mac OS, or Windows). The installation is straightforward: download the file and follow prompts.
   - **RStudio**: Accessible via a link in the video description, select "RStudio Desktop" on their website. It's available as a free version.

2. **Alternatives**:
   - **RStudio Cloud**: Offers cloud-based access to R, eliminating local installation. Sign up for free or consider paid membership. A course-specific link will be provided upon signing up for the course.

3. **Course Access**:
   - Once signed up and logged in via RStudio Cloud, use a link sent via email to access course materials.
   - The cloud version includes 11 assignments and various educational resources organized in notebooks.

4. **Local Setup**: 
   - Download the course files (zip file) from a provided link. Unzip it on your system.
   - Install R first, then RStudio. Use "medical statistics using r.rproj" to launch RStudio with all necessary files visible.

5. **Course Logistics**:
   - Detailed steps and materials will be available during the course for daily activities.
   - The setup is designed to be user-friendly, whether you choose local installation or cloud-based access.

The text is an instructional guide on setting up the necessary software and tools for a short course at Stellenbosch University, focused on using R and RStudio for statistical computing. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Course Overview**: Participants will use R and RStudio to complete various assignments involving statistical analysis.

2. **Software Installation**:
   - **R**: Install via CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Users should search for "RCRAN," select their operating system, download the file, and install it.
   - **RStudio**: Access through a link provided in the course description. Users need to choose the free desktop version on the RStudio website.

3. **Alternative Option**:
   - Participants can use RStudio Cloud, which allows running R in the cloud without local installation. A link will be sent to registered participants to access the course materials directly in RStudio Cloud.

4. **Course Materials and Access**:
   - The course includes 11 assignments and various educational materials.
   - Users should save a permanent copy of their course files on RStudio Cloud for easy access.
   - Alternatively, they can download all necessary files as a zip from CRAN and RStudio websites to work offline.

5. **Guidance**: 
   - Detailed steps will be provided within the course, including a step-by-step guide to follow along with daily assignments.
   - A project file (`medical statistics using r.rproj`) is available for loading all materials in RStudio once installed.

6. **Registration**:
   - Participants are encouraged to register via the Stellenbosch University short course page and receive links to access either local or cloud-based environments.

The guide emphasizes simplicity in setup, providing both local installation options and a cloud-based alternative to facilitate learning statistical computing using R and RStudio.
