The text provides a step-by-step explanation of solving a system of linear equations using matrix inverses. It starts with choosing specific values for \( x \) and \( y \), then translates these into two linear equations: 

1. \( 1x + 2y = 8 \)
2. \( 2x - y = 1 \)

This setup is represented by the augmented matrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & | & 8 \\
2 & -1 & | & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The text introduces the coefficient matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2 \\ 
2 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

and a column vector \( x \) containing the unknowns:

\[
x = \begin{bmatrix} 
x \\ 
y 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The system is then expressed in matrix form as \( A \times x = b \), where \( b \) is the solution vector:

\[
b = \begin{bmatrix} 
8 \\ 
1 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To find \( x \), the inverse of \( A \) (\( A^{-1} \)) is used, leading to:

\[ 
x = A^{-1} \times b
\]

The text emphasizes that finding \( A^{-1} \) allows for solving the system by matrix multiplication. It mentions two methods for computing \( A^{-1}\): using elementary row operations and using software like Mathematica. The explanation includes an illustration of extending \( A \) with an identity matrix to facilitate row operations, though it doesn't complete this process.

Overall, the text explains how matrix algebra can elegantly solve systems of linear equations by leveraging matrix inverses.

The text describes a process of finding the inverse of a 2x2 matrix using elementary row operations. It begins by multiplying rows by constants and adding them together to achieve an identity matrix on the left-hand side, which results in the inverse matrix appearing on the right-hand side. The example uses specific numbers: starting with matrix \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\), it finds its inverse through row operations and scalar multiplications, arriving at \(\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{5} & \frac{2}{5} \\ -\frac{1}{5} & \frac{1}{5} \end{bmatrix}\). The process is verified by multiplying the inverse matrix with a vector to retrieve the original solution vector. It concludes by noting that once you have the inverse of a coefficient matrix, it can be used to solve systems of linear equations. Finally, it mentions using Mathematica to calculate the inverse of matrices in practice.

The text describes solving a system of linear equations using matrices. The coefficients are given by the matrix with entries \( x + 2y \) and \( 2x - y \). To solve this, the inverse of the coefficient matrix is calculated quickly using an "inverse function." The specific elements of the inverse matrix are provided as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{5} & \frac{2}{5} \\
\frac{2}{5} & -\frac{1}{5} 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The constant terms form another matrix \( y = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Multiplying the inverse of the coefficient matrix by this constants matrix yields the solution for the variables, resulting in:

\[
x = 2, \quad y = 3
\]

The text emphasizes that finding the inverse of a matrix and solving linear systems using it is straightforward in software like Mathematica. The process involves using the inverse function to obtain solutions efficiently.
