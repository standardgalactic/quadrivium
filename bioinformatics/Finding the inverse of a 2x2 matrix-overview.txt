The text provides a step-by-step explanation of solving a system of linear equations using matrix inverses. It starts with choosing specific values for \( x \) and \( y \), then translates these into two linear equations: 

1. \( 1x + 2y = 8 \)
2. \( 2x - y = 1 \)

This setup is represented by the augmented matrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & | & 8 \\
2 & -1 & | & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The text introduces the coefficient matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2 \\ 
2 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

and a column vector \( x \) containing the unknowns:

\[
x = \begin{bmatrix} 
x \\ 
y 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The system is then expressed in matrix form as \( A \times x = b \), where \( b \) is the solution vector:

\[
b = \begin{bmatrix} 
8 \\ 
1 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To find \( x \), the inverse of \( A \) (\( A^{-1} \)) is used, leading to:

\[ 
x = A^{-1} \times b
\]

The text emphasizes that finding \( A^{-1} \) allows for solving the system by matrix multiplication. It mentions two methods for computing \( A^{-1}\): using elementary row operations and using software like Mathematica. The explanation includes an illustration of extending \( A \) with an identity matrix to facilitate row operations, though it doesn't complete this process.

Overall, the text explains how matrix algebra can elegantly solve systems of linear equations by leveraging matrix inverses.

The text describes a process of finding the inverse of a 2x2 matrix using elementary row operations. It begins by multiplying rows by constants and adding them together to achieve an identity matrix on the left-hand side, which results in the inverse matrix appearing on the right-hand side. The example uses specific numbers: starting with matrix \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\), it finds its inverse through row operations and scalar multiplications, arriving at \(\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{5} & \frac{2}{5} \\ -\frac{1}{5} & \frac{1}{5} \end{bmatrix}\). The process is verified by multiplying the inverse matrix with a vector to retrieve the original solution vector. It concludes by noting that once you have the inverse of a coefficient matrix, it can be used to solve systems of linear equations. Finally, it mentions using Mathematica to calculate the inverse of matrices in practice.

The text describes solving a system of linear equations using matrices. The coefficients are given by the matrix with entries \( x + 2y \) and \( 2x - y \). To solve this, the inverse of the coefficient matrix is calculated quickly using an "inverse function." The specific elements of the inverse matrix are provided as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{5} & \frac{2}{5} \\
\frac{2}{5} & -\frac{1}{5} 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The constant terms form another matrix \( y = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Multiplying the inverse of the coefficient matrix by this constants matrix yields the solution for the variables, resulting in:

\[
x = 2, \quad y = 3
\]

The text emphasizes that finding the inverse of a matrix and solving linear systems using it is straightforward in software like Mathematica. The process involves using the inverse function to obtain solutions efficiently.

The text provides a walkthrough on solving a system of linear equations using matrix inverses. Here’s a summary:

1. **Introduction to System**: The system involves two unknowns \(x\) and \(y\), with solutions given as \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\). The corresponding equations are:
   \[
   x + 2y = 8
   \]
   \[
   2x - y = 1
   \]

2. **Matrix Representation**: 
   - The coefficient matrix \(A\) is represented as:
     \[
     A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The solution vector \(x\) (not to be confused with the variable \(x\)) is:
     \[
     x = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The constants are in a column vector \(b\):
     \[
     b = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Matrix Equation**: The system can be written as:
   \[
   A \times x = b
   \]
   To solve for \(x\), the inverse of matrix \(A\) is used, leading to:
   \[
   x = A^{-1} \times b
   \]

4. **Finding the Inverse**: The text outlines two methods to find \(A^{-1}\):
   - Using elementary row operations.
   - Extending \(A\) with an identity matrix and performing row operations.

5. **Row Operations Example**:
   - Start with the augmented matrix \([A | I]\):
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & | & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & -1 & | & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Perform row operations to transform \(A\) into the identity matrix, which will convert the right side of the augmented matrix into \(A^{-1}\).

6. **Conclusion**: Once \(A^{-1}\) is found, it can be multiplied by vector \(b\) to find the solution vector \(x\), confirming the solutions \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\). The text emphasizes that while these methods are educational, practical computation often uses software like Mathematica.

The text describes a step-by-step process for finding the inverse of a matrix manually and using it to solve a system of linear equations. Here's a summary:

1. **Matrix Operations**: The author demonstrates multiplying rows by negative scalars and adding them, aiming to transform one row into another specific form (e.g., achieving a leading zero).

2. **Avoiding Fractions Initially**: It’s suggested not to convert numbers into fractions during these calculations but rather keep them as integers until necessary.

3. **Achieving an Identity Matrix**: By performing further operations, such as scaling rows by certain factors, the author transforms one side of an augmented matrix into the identity matrix.

4. **Deriving the Inverse**: Once the left side becomes the identity matrix, the right side is revealed to be the inverse of the original matrix.

5. **Verification**: The inverse matrix is tested by multiplying it with a vector \( y \) (representing transformed equations), and the result matches the expected solution vector \( x \).

6. **Application in Solving Systems**: The text concludes that having the inverse of a matrix allows for solving systems of linear equations, as shown through both manual calculation and verification.

7. **Transition to Software**: Finally, it mentions using Mathematica software to calculate the inverse of a matrix, illustrating how computational tools can assist in these operations.

The process highlights both manual techniques for understanding matrix inversion and practical applications in solving equations.

The text provides an explanation of how to solve a system of linear equations using matrices and their inverses. It describes a matrix of coefficients represented by \(a\), which is:

\[ 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To find the solution, it suggests calculating the inverse of this matrix using an inverse function. The inverse matrix obtained is:

\[ 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{5} & \frac{2}{5} \\
\frac{2}{5} & -\frac{1}{5}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The constant terms of the system are represented by matrix \(y\):

\[ 
\begin{bmatrix}
8 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

By multiplying the inverse of the coefficient matrix \(a\) with matrix \(y\), the solution vector \((x, y)\) is found to be:

\[ 
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
3
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This means that \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\). The text concludes by emphasizing how straightforward it is to calculate the inverse of a matrix in software like Mathematica using the inverse function.
