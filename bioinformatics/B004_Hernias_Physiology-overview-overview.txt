The text describes the physiology of the abdominal cavity, emphasizing its protective role for vital organs. It is shaped like an oval cylinder with the diaphragm at the top and the pelvic floor at the bottom. The abdominal wall contains and safeguards internal organs, provides attachment points, and allows natural openings for structures to pass through. However, weaknesses or defects in certain areas can lead to hernias, where abdominal organs protrude externally.
