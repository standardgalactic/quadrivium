The text describes a methodology for analyzing patient data based on survival status. The process involves:

1. **Splitting the Dataset**: Using software to divide the dataset into two groups based on a categorical variable (survival status: survived or died).

2. **Descriptive Statistics Analysis**: Calculating descriptive statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, for the numerical variable of age within each group.

3. **Data Visualization**: Employing box plots to visually compare age distributions between the two groups.

4. **Reverting Dataset Changes**: Highlighting the importance of reverting the dataset to its original state after analysis to prevent unintended splits in future analyses.

The tutorial provides a straightforward approach for splitting datasets by categorical variables and emphasizes the need to revert changes post-analysis to preserve data integrity. It also mentions that more complex methods, like using numerical ranges, are possible but not covered here.
