The text describes a methodology for analyzing patient data based on survival status. The process involves:

1. **Splitting the Dataset**: Using software to divide the dataset into two groups based on a categorical variable (survival status: survived or died).

2. **Descriptive Statistics Analysis**: Calculating descriptive statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, for the numerical variable of age within each group.

3. **Data Visualization**: Employing box plots to visually compare age distributions between the two groups.

4. **Reverting Dataset Changes**: Highlighting the importance of reverting the dataset to its original state after analysis to prevent unintended splits in future analyses.

The tutorial provides a straightforward approach for splitting datasets by categorical variables and emphasizes the need to revert changes post-analysis to preserve data integrity. It also mentions that more complex methods, like using numerical ranges, are possible but not covered here.

The text describes a method for analyzing patient data by dividing it into groups based on a categorical variable, specifically survival status. The process includes:

1. **Splitting the File**: Using software to separate data into two categories—survivors and non-survivors—to enable comparative analysis.
   
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating statistics such as mean and standard deviation for each group separately.

3. **Visualization**: Employing a box plot to compare age distributions between the groups visually.

4. **Reverting Changes**: Emphasizing the importance of returning the dataset to its original state after analysis to prevent unintended splits in future work.

The method is straightforward, with an option for more complex approaches using numerical ranges, but it stresses maintaining data integrity by undoing the split post-analysis.
