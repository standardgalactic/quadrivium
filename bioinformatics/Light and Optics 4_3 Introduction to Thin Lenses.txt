Now another very interesting problem and again I'm going to read it to you.
They want to know in what two positions will a converging thin lens
of a focal distance 9 cm, positive
9 cm, form images of an object on a
screen located 40 cm from
the object. So we're given a
converging lens, we're told it has a focal distance of positive 9
and we said in what two positions
in what two positions can we
place an object to give us
an image on the screen located 40 cm
from the object. So I'm going to have my lens, I'm going to have this
and then the distance between the object and the screen
is going to be 40 cm and what they are saying
is for us to have this 40 cm
40 cm difference I can actually
place this object in
two different spots that is going to
give me a total distance of
that. So S0 plus
SI equals
40.0 cm.
Okay
now what do we
do with this? Again
I think let's get SI which is just going to be
40 minus S0
so we're going to have
1 over S0 plus
1 over
40 minus S0 is going to equal
1 over 9
1 over 9
this is simple simple algebra
I'm going to get a common
denominator and that is going to leave me
40 minus S0
plus S0
and that is going to equal 1 over 9
I'm going to have negative S0 plus S0
so those two cancel out so I'm going to be left
with 40 over
and I'm going to get 40 S0
I really don't want to do this simple algebra
minus S0
squared
is going to equal 1 over 9
so
40 S0 minus S0
squared is going to equal
360
I can say that S0
squared minus 40
S0 plus
360 equals 0
now I can just use my quadratic
formula and I'm going to get S0
of minus B
plus minus the square root of B
squared minus 4AC
divided by 2A
in which A is 1
B is negative 40
and C is 360
and we get two values
and I
26.3 centimeters
and
13.7
13.7 centimeters
so don't think
for one instance
they're placing it on one spot
is now suddenly going to give you two images
that's not what they're asking
they're asking if I have a difference
but from there to there
I can actually place
this object in two different positions
in this problem we're going to be given
very little information
and you see you can still get an answer
I'm told that I have a converting lens
with a focal distance
so it's going to be positive
it was 50.0 centimeters
and I'm told
it gives a
an image
an object is placed in train of it
it gives an image that is magnified two and a half times
and they want to know
how fast the object and the image from each other
how fast the object and the image from each other
if the image is
real
so immediately you know that
when the image is real
it means that that's my focal distance
I have placed
I have placed an object further away
than this distance
and the only way that it's going to give
a real image
it's further away
it's going to give a real image
it was closer it was going to give a virtual image on the same side
and if this is the situation
this is going to be a negative magnification
so immediately we can put a negative there
now
M equals negative SI over S0
that will give me an SI of
negative M S0
that is going to be negative
negative 2.50 times S0
S0
so SI equals
2.50 S0
I've got a relationship between SI and S0
and I just need
I can do it the other way around as well
it doesn't matter
I'm not choosing this direct
this way for a specific reason
I just need a replacement
and as much as I know
1 over S0 plus 1 over SI
which is now 2.5 times S0
I'm going to equal
1 over
1 over
the focal distance F
which I know to be 50 cm
again I'm going to
I'm just going to run through this because this is a simple algebra
I'm going to get an S0
and I'm going to get 2.5 S0
S0
so this means I'm going to get 2.5 S0
plus S0
is going to equal 1 over 50
I'm going to get 3.5 S0
over 2.5 S0 squared
equals 1 over 50
that means
3.5 times 50 is
3.5 times 50
I think that's somewhere on the board
I did it somewhere on the board
I did it somewhere on the board
I can't remember
I can't remember
50 and 50 is
150 plus
another half is going to be
175
175 equals
2.5 times S0
2.5 times S0
that will give me
an S0 of
175 divided by 2.5
I think was about
70
70 cm
now I can work out SI
SI will just be 2.5 times that
so my SI is going to be
I got 175 cm
and eventually I can
just add those two and I get
245 cm
245 cm
245 cm
so it was quite simple
that I do have an equation
I do have two unknowns
but those two unknowns
S0 and SI
are related to each other
by this M
by this equation
so I can express one in terms of the other
and if I did the other way around
I would have gotten this answer first
and then had to do that answer
I did this
for this problem
I better choose my
independent variable
with a bit of K
and I've got to realize something else
two key points to this problem
I'm told that I have a thin lens
and it has a focal distance F
I'm not told whether it's convex or concave
it has a magnification of N
once again I'm not told whether this is N positive or N negative
I want to show that
and here's the first clue
first key point
that I can show an image on a screen
and there's only one way you can do that
and that's with a convex lens
and that is replace the object further away
than the focal distance
that's the only way you can project
or if it was closer
it will be a virtual image
if it was a concave lens
it will be a virtual image
okay so I immediately know
this has got to be a negative
and that has got to be a positive
that's the only way that you're going to get to this
that you are going to get to this equation
and if I have 1 over S0
plus 1 over SI
equals 1 over F
now look at this
I need SI
in my equation
so if M
equals negative SI
over S0
which one am I going to get rid of?
I'm going to get rid of this S0
because there's no SIZ
so that's the second key point
so I've got to express a 0 in terms of
negative SI over M
and in this instance
it's going to be a negative SI
divided by what is M
while M is negative N
that equals SI over N
okay let's do this equation
1 over S0
so it's going to be 1 over SI over N
which is this N over SI
plus 1 over SI
equals 1 over F
so I'm going to have SI as a common
I mean it's 1 over A plus 2 over A
my denominators are the same
so that's N plus 1
equals 1 over F
in other words
SI equals N plus 1
right left
done
good let's do a radius of curvature problem
I think let's do
we have a thin lens
it has a convex surface
of radius 20 centimeters
and a concave surface
of 40 centimeters
so R1 equals 20 centimeters
and R2 equals 40.0 centimeters
centimeters
and we are told that this one is convex
convex and this one is concave
now I think it's one thing that we admitted in the introductory video
if you have a lens
now on one side it's going to be convex
and on the other side it is going to be concave
so like the moon
okay
what you do is to decide which one is positive or which one is negative
you draw a straight line
you draw a straight line the central axis
and you look at where the center point of the completed circle would be
and that's the middle
let's say that's the middle
so this is a circle so its center point is going to lie to the right
of the center line
and this is also a semicircle
so its one is also going to be towards the right
if it's to the right of the center line
these are positive values
these are positive values
say I have a bi-convex lens
so one side is very convex
say the other side is slightly convex
I draw a central line
central line
now this circle is going to be on that side
this circle is going to be on the left side
in other words
this surface will have a negative value for its radius of curvature
but I'm told this one side is convex
so its center point of that arc will be to the right
and of the concave one also to the right
so these will both be positive
okay
we also told I think we have a refractive index of 1.54
and we want the focal lens
and we want to know whether its converging or diverging
and we know the equation 1 over f equals n minus 1
divided by 1 over r1 minus 1 over r2
so we want
we want the value for n
and we also want the value for n
we were told that's 1.54
sorry about that
we want this
and we want to know its converging or diverging lens
so we're going to have 1 over f
is going to equal 1.54 minus 1 is 0.54
and then we're going to have 1 over 20 centimeters
minus 1 over 40 centimeters
and what is that going to be
1 over f is going to be
well let me just give you the whole thing
f is going to be
if it's going to be
well if you have 1 20th and you take away a 40th
you are going to be left with a 40th
so its 0.54 divided by 40
and turn that around because this is 1 over f
just check whether you get the same
I got 74.1 centimeters
so this is a converging lens
converging
turns out to be a converging lens
very funny moon shape lens
but anyway
it will be converging
and this one shows its focal distance
as a positive value
