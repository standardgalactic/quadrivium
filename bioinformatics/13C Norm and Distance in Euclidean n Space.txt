Okay, in this section we're still dealing with the norm and the distance in Euclidean in space
and here I have some four equalities or inequalities as far as norm is concerned
the distance, the length, I should say, of a vector
and that is the length of a vector, its norm, is greater than or equal to zero
always, it's the square root of all the elements squared
and we're taking the positive square root
it can only be zero if the u is the zero vector though
if I have a scalar times a vector, its norm is the same as the absolute value
because we want a positive length times the norm of that vector
and the last one is the simplest problem, more the triangular inequality
and that says if I have two vectors and I add them, take their length
it's always going to be less than or equal to the length of the two combined
so if I have one vector and another vector
this length is always going to be less than those two combined
unless they're both in the same line
then the combination will be exactly equal to the individual length
and in the next video we'll just look at a quick proof of this inequality
as promised, let's do a proof of the triangular inequality
what I'm going to start off with is the left-hand side
and I'm just going to square it
and remember before that the square of the norm of the vector
equals just the dot product of those two vectors
please remember that
so what we're going to have here is the dot product
or those two vectors, the dot product
u plus u
so I could have called that vector p
so that would be vector p dot product vector p
if I multiply these out I'm going to get vector u dot product vector u
I'm going to add to that
twice the u dot product v
and last I'm going to have v dot product v
that is what I'm going to have
that is what I'm going to have
now I remember
or what shall we do
what shall we do
I can say that this is less than or equal to
u dot u
so let's have that
u dot u
plus
now I see there's an extra line in there which should not be there
remember the gauchy-schwartz inequality
let's say that u dot v is less than or equal to
the multiplication of the two norms
so if I put in here two
and I put an absolute value in here
u dot v
or let me just get there first
v dot v
v dot v
let's have a look at that
why do I say that
if I get the dot product of two vectors
and I get the dot product of two vectors
that might be a positive
or it might be a negative
if that turned out to be a negative
I multiply by two I'll have a negative
that's why if I put the absolute value sign
z
it's got to be less than or equal to
what this is
less than or equal to what
what
that value is
okay now
I know that this equals
that squared
in other words I'm dealing with
the norm
of
u
squared
that's what I'm dealing with there
I still have two
I have u dot v
and I have
the norm of v squared
now
let's have
the gauchy shorts inequality
and as much as
I can plug this in
for that
so I can plug this in for that
so I'm going to have
less than or equal to u
the norm squared plus
I have twice now
u
v
plus
v
squared
and that just looks like
something we know from algebra
in as much as
that is just going to be u
the vector u squared
plus the vector v
squared
and the whole thing
squared
and still have
less than or equal to y
I started with this
so I can just have
take away
the squares
and I'm left with
the norm of u plus v
plus v
is less than or equal
to the norm of u
plus the norm of v
proof of that triangular inequality
because we've looked at some
properties of the norm
and some properties of distance
we say the distance between
two vectors is always
greater than or equal to zero
and indeed the distance
between them is zero
if and only if u minus v
equals zero
and for that to happen
obviously u must equal
vector v
and the distance between
u and v is the same
as the distance between
v comma u
that should just be a comma
v comma u
why is that?
because the distance
between two vectors
is one minus the other one
and we take the norm of that
which is always going to be
a positive distance
so those two are exactly the same
and this is another
or a restatement
of the triangular inequality
distance between u and v
remember if I have vector u
if I have vector u
and I have vector v
it's u minus v
in that direction
and if I have a third one
vector u
distance between u and w
and then from
or v and w
remember that's the same
as w and v
so if I add those two
together
w and v
let's make that clear
so it's u and w
and w and v
but remember
that would be the same
as v and w
but that would always be
less than
or equal to or less than
the straight from
u due to w
now this is another way
of looking at dot product
I'm stating that that is
a quarter times the square root
of the norm
of the addition of those
two vectors
minus a quarter of the norm
squared of
subjecting those two vectors
how is that possible
well let's start
with the right hand side
that's very easy
we need to be left
with a quarter
and what it is
oh wait let's do that
let's very simply
just look at another way
of writing this
remember that could
just then be vector p
the norm of vector p squared
is p dot p
so this is going to be
if I take this
u plus v
the norm of that squared
that is going to be
nothing other than
u plus v dot product
u plus v
u plus v
dot product
u plus v
ok let's get to
let's do it properly
what is that going to be
well that's going to be
vector u
dot product
vector u
and I never did that
if I had one vector
dot product itself
that is going to be
the norm of
vector u squared
plus I'm going to have
twice
u dot v
u dot v
and then I'm going to
have again vector
v's norm squared
and if I have
u minus v
squared
that is going to be
exactly that
other than the fact
I'm going to get
u squared
I'm going to get
minus 2
u dot v
and now it becomes
easy to see
where we're heading
with this
because if I now
substitute this
in there
and this in there
I'm going to have
these two cancel out
I'm going to have
these two cancel out
and then I'm also
going to have
so I'm just
substituting this
in there
and this in there
in the end
I'm going to be
left with a half
u dot v
and then I'm going to
and then I'm going to have
minus a quarter
times that
which is another half
of u dot v
so if you just
substitute all this
in there
it'll be a quarter
times this
which will leave
this a quarter
this a half
this a quarter
minus
that quarter
so minus a quarter
minus a quarter
so all of these
norm squares
will leave
it will go
but because there's
a negative
times a negative
quarter
that will be
plus a half
so we're going to have
a half
plus another half
of that
and that equals
this one
full one
u dot v
as simple as that
so another way
to write
the euclidean
in a product
of two
vectors
