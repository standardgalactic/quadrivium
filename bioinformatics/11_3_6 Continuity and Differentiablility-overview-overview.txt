The task involves analyzing a function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) to find the tangent plane at the point \((1, 1)\) and proving its differentiability from first principles.

**Step 1: Find the Tangent Plane**

To determine the equation of the tangent plane to the surface defined by \( z = f(x, y) \) at a given point \((x_0, y_0)\), we use:

\[
z = f(x_0, y_0) + (x - x_0)f_x(x_0, y_0) + (y - y_0)f_y(x_0, y_0)
\]

**Partial Derivatives:**
- \( f_x(x, y) = 2x \)
- \( f_y(x, y) = 2y \)

Evaluated at the point \((1, 1)\):
- \( f(1, 1) = 2 \)
- \( f_x(1, 1) = 2 \)
- \( f_y(1, 1) = 2 \)

Substituting these into the tangent plane formula gives:

\[
z = 2 + (x - 1) \cdot 2 + (y - 1) \cdot 2
\]

Simplifying, we get the equation of the tangent plane:

\[
z = 2x + 2y - 2
\]

**Step 2: Prove Differentiability from First Principles**

To show differentiability at \((1, 1)\), demonstrate that:

\[
\lim_{(h,k) \to (0,0)} \frac{f(1+h, 1+k) - f(1, 1) - f_x(1, 1)h - f_y(1, 1)k}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = 0
\]

**Calculate \( f(1+h, 1+k) \):**

\[
f(1+h, 1+k) = (1+h)^2 + (1+k)^2 = 2 + 2h + 2k + h^2 + k^2
\]

The expression simplifies to:

\[
f(1+h, 1+k) - f(1, 1) - f_x(1, 1)h - f_y(1, 1)k = h^2 + k^2
\]

Evaluate the limit:

\[
\lim_{(h,k) \to (0,0)} \frac{h^2 + k^2}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = \lim_{(h,k) \to (0,0)} \sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = 0
\]

Thus, \( f(x, y) \) is differentiable at the point \((1, 1)\).

**Conclusion:**

The equation of the tangent plane to the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) at the point \((1, 1)\) is \( z = 2x + 2y - 2\), and the function is differentiable at this point.

The text provides information about the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \). Specifically, it states that at the point \((1, 1)\), the equation of the tangent plane to the surface defined by this function is given by \( z = 2x + 2y - 2 \). Additionally, it confirms from first principles (likely using limits and derivatives) that the function \( f(x, y) \) is differentiable at the point \((1, 1)\), which justifies the existence of this tangent plane. Differentiability implies continuity and the existence of a linear approximation at that point, represented by the tangent plane equation.
