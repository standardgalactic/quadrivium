The text outlines how to calculate the amount of ice at 0 degrees Celsius that can be melted by the energy released from the alpha decay of radium-224 over its half-life period of 3.66 days.

1. **Decay Process:** Radium-224 undergoes alpha decay to form radon-220, releasing energy in the process.

2. **Energy Calculation:**
   - The energy per decay is determined by the difference in atomic mass units (amu) between the parent and daughter nuclei and converted into joules.
   - This involves converting the mass defect into mega electron volts (MeV), then to joules using conversion factors.

3. **Amount of Radium:** 
   - Start with 1 gram of radium-224, which contains approximately \(2.69 \times 10^{21}\) atoms.

4. **Decay Over Time:**
   - Use the half-life formula to determine how many nuclei remain after 3.66 days.
   - Calculate the decay constant (\(\lambda\)) using \(\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{\text{half-life}}\).
   - Determine the number of decayed atoms over this period.

5. **Total Energy Released:**
   - Multiply the energy per decay by the number of decays to find the total energy released.
   
6. **Melting Ice:**
   - Use the latent heat of fusion for ice (33.5 J/g) to calculate how much ice can be melted with the total energy available.

7. **Result:** 
   - Approximately 3,710 kilograms (or over three and a half tons) of ice can be melted by the energy released from alpha decay of one gram of radium-224 in 3.66 days. 

This calculation demonstrates the significant amount of energy involved in nuclear processes even at small scales.
