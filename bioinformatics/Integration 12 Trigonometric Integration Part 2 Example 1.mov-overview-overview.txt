The text outlines a method for integrating \(\sin^3(x)\) using trigonometric identities and substitution. It begins by recognizing the odd power of sine, allowing us to express \(\sin^2(x)\) as \(1 - \cos^2(x)\). This transforms the integral \(\int \sin^3(x) \, dx\) into \(\int (1 - \cos^2(x))\sin(x) \, dx\). By substituting \(u = \cos(x)\), with \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\), the integral becomes \(-\int (1 - u^2) \, du\). Simplifying this gives \(u - \frac{1}{3}u^3 + C\). Substituting back \(u = \cos(x)\), the final result is \(\frac{\cos^3(x)}{3} - \cos(x) + C\).
