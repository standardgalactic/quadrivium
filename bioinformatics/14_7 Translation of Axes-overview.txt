The text explains how to transform the axes of integration in a double integral from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to a new set of coordinates (u, v). The transformation equations given are \( x = 2u \) and \( y = u + v \).

Initially, the integration is over a rectangular region defined by \( 1 \leq x \leq 2 \) and \( 0 \leq y \leq 2 \). After applying the transformation, this rectangle becomes a parallelogram in the (u, v) coordinate system. The vertices of the original rectangle are transformed into new points using the given equations for u and v.

The Jacobian matrix of the transformation is computed to find its determinant, which turns out to be 2. This determinant accounts for how areas change under the transformation: specifically, it scales the differential area element dy dx by a factor of 1/2 in the new coordinate system, resulting in \( dA = 2 \, dv \, du \).

The transformed integral thus involves integrating over a parallelogram rather than a rectangle. The original function \( f(x, y) = xy \) is expressed in terms of u and v as \( f(u, v) = 2u^2 + 2uv \). This new expression for the integrand, along with the modified limits for u (from 1/2 to 1) and v (from -u to 2-u), completes the setup for integration in the transformed coordinates. The text emphasizes that when changing variables in an integral, one must adjust both the function being integrated and the differential area element by the determinant of the Jacobian to maintain equivalence between integrals over different coordinate systems.

The text discusses transforming an iterated integral by moving constants outside to simplify the calculation. It suggests rewriting the integral so that its limits run from \( \frac{1}{2} \) to 1 and from \(-u\) to \(2-u\). The integrand involves terms like \(2u^2 + 2uv\), which can be treated as constants outside of the integration, transforming it into a standard double integral similar to those performed in Cartesian coordinates. When solved correctly using these methods, the result is 3. The text encourages trying this transformation and solving the integral in both its original form and with the modified limits, confirming that either approach yields the same answer.
