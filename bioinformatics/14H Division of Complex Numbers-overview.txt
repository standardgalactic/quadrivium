The text provides a mathematical exploration involving complex numbers and solving linear equations using Cramer's Rule.

1. **Complex Conjugate Proof:**
   - The task is to prove that the complex conjugate of \( z^2 \) (where \( z = a + bi \)) equals the square of the complex conjugate itself.
   - Calculation steps:
     - \( z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 \).
     - The complex conjugate of \( z^2 \) is \( a^2 - b^2 - 2abi \).
     - The square of the complex conjugate \( \overline{z} = (a - bi)^2 = a^2 - 2abi - b^2 \), which matches the conjugate of \( z^2 \).
   - Conclusion: The two expressions are equal, proving the statement.

2. **Solving Linear Equations with Cramer's Rule:**
   - A system of linear equations is set up as \( Ax = b \), where:
     - Matrix \( A \) and column vector \( b \) are defined.
     - Check if the determinant of matrix \( A \) is non-zero to use Cramer's Rule.
   - Determinant Calculation for \( A \):
     - \( \text{det}(A) = -4 \), confirming that Cramer's Rule can be applied.
   - Solving for Variables:
     - Replace columns in \( A \) with vector \( b \) to find determinants for each variable (\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \)).
     - Calculations show:
       - \( x_1 = \frac{-2 - 4i}{-4} = \frac{1}{2} + i \)
       - \( x_2 = \frac{-8}{-4} = 2 \)
       - The solution for \( x_3 \) is inferred to be \( \frac{1}{2} - i \).
   - Conclusion: Using Cramer's Rule, the solutions are found for the variables in the system of equations.

The text describes the process of using Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve a system of linear equations. Instead of using Kremersoul, an augmented matrix is set up with complex numbers:

- The original matrix:
  - Row 1: [2, -1, -i]
  - Row 2: [0, -1+i, 1]

This matrix is transformed into an augmented form to prepare for Gauss-Jordan elimination. To begin the process, the first row is multiplied by ½ to achieve a leading 1:

- Modified Row 1: [1, -1/2, -1/2*i, 0]
  
Next, this modified row is used to eliminate the corresponding element in the second row. The first row is multiplied by (-1+i) and subtracted from the second row:

- Resulting Row 2 after subtraction becomes all zeros: [0, 0, 0]

This indicates that one of the rows has been fully reduced, resulting in a row of zeros. At this point, x₂ can be chosen freely (as it represents a free variable), allowing for the determination of solutions to the system beyond the trivial solution where both variables are zero. The text emphasizes careful step-by-step manipulation and avoiding combining steps when solving such systems.

The text describes a process for solving equations involving variables \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). Initially, it sets \(x_2 = t\), but suggests simplifying by letting \(x_2 = 2t\). This change leads to the equation for \(x_1\) being \(-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}it\). Substituting \(x_2 = 2t\) requires distributing a factor of 2, resulting in \(x_1 = 1 + it\). Therefore, the solutions are \(x_1 = 1 + it\) and \(x_2 = 2t\).
