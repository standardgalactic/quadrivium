The text provides a mathematical exploration involving complex numbers and solving linear equations using Cramer's Rule.

1. **Complex Conjugate Proof:**
   - The task is to prove that the complex conjugate of \( z^2 \) (where \( z = a + bi \)) equals the square of the complex conjugate itself.
   - Calculation steps:
     - \( z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 \).
     - The complex conjugate of \( z^2 \) is \( a^2 - b^2 - 2abi \).
     - The square of the complex conjugate \( \overline{z} = (a - bi)^2 = a^2 - 2abi - b^2 \), which matches the conjugate of \( z^2 \).
   - Conclusion: The two expressions are equal, proving the statement.

2. **Solving Linear Equations with Cramer's Rule:**
   - A system of linear equations is set up as \( Ax = b \), where:
     - Matrix \( A \) and column vector \( b \) are defined.
     - Check if the determinant of matrix \( A \) is non-zero to use Cramer's Rule.
   - Determinant Calculation for \( A \):
     - \( \text{det}(A) = -4 \), confirming that Cramer's Rule can be applied.
   - Solving for Variables:
     - Replace columns in \( A \) with vector \( b \) to find determinants for each variable (\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \)).
     - Calculations show:
       - \( x_1 = \frac{-2 - 4i}{-4} = \frac{1}{2} + i \)
       - \( x_2 = \frac{-8}{-4} = 2 \)
       - The solution for \( x_3 \) is inferred to be \( \frac{1}{2} - i \).
   - Conclusion: Using Cramer's Rule, the solutions are found for the variables in the system of equations.

The text describes the process of using Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve a system of linear equations. Instead of using Kremersoul, an augmented matrix is set up with complex numbers:

- The original matrix:
  - Row 1: [2, -1, -i]
  - Row 2: [0, -1+i, 1]

This matrix is transformed into an augmented form to prepare for Gauss-Jordan elimination. To begin the process, the first row is multiplied by ½ to achieve a leading 1:

- Modified Row 1: [1, -1/2, -1/2*i, 0]
  
Next, this modified row is used to eliminate the corresponding element in the second row. The first row is multiplied by (-1+i) and subtracted from the second row:

- Resulting Row 2 after subtraction becomes all zeros: [0, 0, 0]

This indicates that one of the rows has been fully reduced, resulting in a row of zeros. At this point, x₂ can be chosen freely (as it represents a free variable), allowing for the determination of solutions to the system beyond the trivial solution where both variables are zero. The text emphasizes careful step-by-step manipulation and avoiding combining steps when solving such systems.

The text describes a process for solving equations involving variables \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). Initially, it sets \(x_2 = t\), but suggests simplifying by letting \(x_2 = 2t\). This change leads to the equation for \(x_1\) being \(-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}it\). Substituting \(x_2 = 2t\) requires distributing a factor of 2, resulting in \(x_1 = 1 + it\). Therefore, the solutions are \(x_1 = 1 + it\) and \(x_2 = 2t\).

The text provides a mathematical exploration and proof involving complex numbers, linear algebra, and Kramer's rule. Here is a summary:

1. **Complex Numbers:**
   - The problem involves proving that the square of the complex conjugate of a number \( z \) (where \( z = a + bi \)) equals the conjugate of \( z^2 \).
   - Steps:
     - Calculate \( z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 \).
     - Find the complex conjugate of \( z^2 \), resulting in \( a^2 - b^2 - 2abi \).
     - Calculate the square of the complex conjugate of \( z \) (\( (a - bi)^2 = a^2 - 2abi - b^2 \)).
   - Both expressions are shown to be equal, proving the initial statement.

2. **Kramer's Rule:**
   - Kramer's rule is used to solve a system of linear equations represented as \( Ax = b \).
   - Matrix \( A \) and vector \( b \) are defined.
     - \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & -1 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \), 
     - \( b = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 + 2i \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - The determinant of matrix \( A \) is calculated to be non-zero, allowing the use of Kramer's rule.
   - Solutions for variables \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \) are found by computing determinants of matrices formed by replacing columns of \( A \) with vector \( b \).
     - \( x_1 = 0.5 + i \)
     - \( x_2 = 2 \)
     - \( x_3 = 0.5 - i \)

The text effectively demonstrates the application of complex number properties and linear algebra techniques to solve mathematical problems.

The text describes the process of using Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve a system of equations represented by an augmented matrix. The goal is to transform this matrix into reduced row echelon form. Here’s a summary:

1. **Setup**: Start with an augmented matrix for the given linear system, which includes coefficients and constants on the right side.

2. **Objective**: Achieve leading 1s in each row while ensuring zeros below and above these leading 1s.

3. **First Step**: Multiply the first row by a half to create a leading 1 in the first column.

4. **Row Operations**: Use the modified first row to eliminate other entries in its column:
   - Multiply the first row by \((-1 + i)\) and subtract from the second row.
   - This operation aims to clear out the elements below the leading 1, turning them into zeros.

5. **Resulting Matrix**: After these operations, one of the rows becomes all zeros, indicating a dependent equation in the system.

6. **Solution Strategy**: With a row of zeros, introduce a parameter (e.g., \(x_2\)) to express the solution set, as there are infinitely many solutions rather than a single unique solution.

The process demonstrates how Gauss-Jordan elimination can simplify solving systems by systematically transforming matrices and using row operations to achieve desired forms.

The text appears to be explaining a step-by-step process for solving equations involving variables \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). Initially, \( x_2 \) is set equal to \( t \), and then it's suggested that setting \( x_2 = 2t \) simplifies the calculations. This change leads to a new expression where:

- \( x_1 \) becomes \( -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}i \cdot t \).
- Simplifying further, this can be expressed as \( -(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i)t \).

When setting \( x_2 = 2t \), the expression for \( x_1 \) is adjusted to account for the factor of 2 being distributed. This results in:

- \( x_1 = (1 + i)t \).

Thus, the final answers are:
- \( x_1 = (1 + i)t \)
- \( x_2 = 2t \)
