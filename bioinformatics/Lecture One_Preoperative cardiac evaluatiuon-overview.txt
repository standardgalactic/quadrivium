The lecture provides a comprehensive overview of managing patients with cardiac conditions who are being considered for surgery. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating these patients to minimize perioperative morbidity and mortality, streamline processes, and comply with regulatory requirements.

Key points include:

1. **Prevalence**: Between 1-3% of non-cardiac surgeries result in cardiac complications.
2. **Importance of Evaluation**: Evaluating cardiac status is crucial for all surgical patients to ensure good outcomes and efficient resource use.
3. **Regulatory Considerations**: Patient consent and awareness are critical, with protocols often tailored to local requirements.

The lecture introduces a management algorithm based on guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association. This involves assessing:

- Critical cardiac conditions
- Risk associated with different types of surgery
- Functional capacity of patients
- Clinical risk factors

Additionally, the ASA classification system is highlighted as a starting point for preoperative evaluation, ranging from completely healthy individuals (ASA class 1) to those who are brain dead and may be considered for organ donation (ASA class 6).

The algorithm specifically considers active cardiac conditions such as unstable coronary syndromes, recent myocardial infarctions, worsening heart failure, and significant arrhythmias. These factors determine the need to enhance cardiac reserves or potentially modify surgical plans.

The text discusses the importance of evaluating ventricular tachycardia and severe stenotic valvular diseases, like severe aortic and symptomatic mitral stenosis, before surgery. It emphasizes examining heart sounds as part of pre-surgical assessments due to potential cardiac complications from surgical interventions.

Surgery is categorized based on its risk for cardiac complications by considering hemodynamic effects or fluid shifts it might cause. Risk classifications include low-risk surgeries (less than 1% complication rate), such as dental and minor orthopedic procedures; intermediate-risk surgeries (1% to 5% complication rate), like abdominal and major neurological operations; and high-risk surgeries (over 5% complication rate), including major vascular surgeries, often involving patients with existing cardiac conditions.

The text further highlights the importance of assessing a patient's functional capacity in METs to determine their ability to withstand surgery. A good shape is defined as reaching four or more metabolic equivalents, while low scores require careful consideration due to weak correlations with outcomes.

Finally, it mentions various clinical risk factors and predictive indices like the Predictive Cardiac Risk Index, but notes that not all individual risk factors have been proven to correlate with worse surgical outcomes.

The text outlines an approach for managing non-cardiac surgery in patients with various cardiac risk factors. The Lee Index identifies five primary risk factors: ischemic heart disease, compensated or previous heart failure, insulin-dependent diabetes, renal insufficiency (creatinine levels above 180 mmol/L or 2 mg/dL), and cerebrovascular disease. Other important but non-predictive factors include obesity, high cholesterol, and family history of cardiac disease.

The management algorithm starts by determining if the surgery is an emergency. If so, manage cardiac status intra- and postoperatively due to potential severe morbidity or mortality from delays. For non-emergencies, assess whether the patient has any listed cardiac conditions (e.g., unstable coronary syndromes, significant arrhythmias) that require a physician or cardiologist evaluation.

For patients without these conditions, determine the surgery's risk level:
- Low-risk surgeries can proceed as planned.
- Intermediate or high-risk surgeries need further assessment of the patientâ€™s functional capacity. If they achieve four or more metabolic equivalents (METs), surgery can continue; otherwise, consider clinical risk factors.
  - Three or more risk factors warrant consultation.
  - One or two factors allow surgery unless consultation might alter management.
  - No risk factors mean it is safe to proceed.

The text also highlights the increased number of patients with prior coronary artery interventions (balloon angioplasty and stents) requiring careful pre-surgical planning. Recommendations include dual antiplatelet therapy post-procedure, with clopidogrel for at least a month after bare metal stents, or up to a year for drug-eluting stents. The need for non-cardiac surgery within this period is a contraindication for drug-eluting stent placement.

The algorithm from the ACC AHA addresses patients who have undergone percutaneous interventions, dividing them into those with balloon angioplasty only and others, which will be discussed further in subsequent lectures.

The text provides guidelines for managing surgical procedures in patients with different cardiovascular interventions:

1. **Balloon Angioplasty**: 
   - If surgery is required within two weeks post-procedure, it should be delayed.
   - Beyond two weeks, surgery can proceed on aspirin.

2. **Bare Metal Stents**:
   - Surgery should be postponed if performed sooner than 30 to 45 days after stent placement.
   - After the cutoff period, patients may go to surgery with aspirin alone.

3. **Drug Eluting Stents**:
   - A one-year waiting period is recommended before proceeding to surgery.
   - Surgeries are advised only on aspirin if more than a year has passed since stent placement; otherwise, delay is suggested.

4. **Preoperative ECGs**: 
   - Their prognostic value is unclear unless diagnosing severe arrhythmias.
   - Routine testing often depends on age and is recommended for patients with cardiac history or high-risk surgery indications.
   - Abnormalities like major Q-wave changes, ST segment changes, major T-wave changes, Mobitz type 2 blocks, left bundle branch block, and AFib should prompt referral to a specialist.

5. **Perioperative Statin Use**:
   - Optimal dosage and timing are unknown, but continuation during the perioperative period is advised by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.

6. **Beta Blockers**:
   - Despite their protective effects for at-risk patients being well-documented, recent revelations about research irregularities have cast doubt on some recommendations.
   - Dosing and timing protocols were previously detailed but may need reevaluation in light of new findings.

This summary encapsulates the guidelines while noting the ongoing uncertainty surrounding certain practices.

The text discusses concerns regarding the routine use of beta blockers, suggesting they may increase mortality risk by about 27%. It advises caution and reevaluation of their use while highlighting that cardiovascular medications should generally continue through the perioperative period. The discontinuation of certain drugs like centrally acting alpha-2 agonists or ACE inhibitors can lead to severe health issues such as rebound hypertension and recurrence in congestive cardiac failure, respectively. Diuretic therapy requires careful management to prevent hypovolemia and hyperkalemia before surgery. Patients with hypertension need close monitoring during surgery due to potential blood and fluid loss. The goal of preoperative consultations is not only to clear patients for surgery but also to adjust their cardiac management to improve reserve capacity and reduce surgical risks. Identifying patients who may benefit from further non-invasive or invasive investigations to change their treatment plan is crucial, with decisions on stress ECGs, echocardiograms, or angiograms left to the cardiologist's discretion. The next lecture will cover pulmonary conditions.

This lecture focuses on the management of patients with cardiac conditions who are being considered for surgery. It introduces a management algorithm derived from guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, aimed at evaluating and making decisions about surgical candidates with cardiac issues.

Key points discussed include:

1. **Prevalence and Impact**: Between 1% and 3% of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery experience cardiac complications, underscoring the importance of assessing cardiac status for all surgical candidates.

2. **Reasons for Preoperative Evaluation**:
   - Ensuring good patient outcomes by minimizing perioperative morbidity and mortality.
   - Streamlining processes to avoid unnecessary tests and delays, which can be costly and stressful for patients.
   - Addressing regulatory requirements, including informed patient consent.

3. **Understanding Cardiac Reserve**: The heart is described as a pump with reserve capacity that must be sufficient to meet increased demands during surgery. Evaluating this reserve helps determine if surgical plans need adjustment or cancellation.

4. **Algorithm Components**:
   - Identification of critical cardiac conditions.
   - Assessment of surgical risk levels.
   - Evaluation of the patient's functional or exercise capacity.
   - Consideration of clinical risk factors.

5. **ASA Classification**: The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification system is mentioned as a starting point for assessing general health, although it is not specific to cardiac patients alone.

6. **Active Cardiac Conditions**: Specific conditions are highlighted that require attention during preoperative evaluation, such as unstable coronary syndromes, recent myocardial infarctions, worsening heart failure, and significant arrhythmias.

The lecture emphasizes the importance of a structured approach to preoperative cardiac evaluation to ensure patient safety, resource efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

The text discusses considerations for evaluating patients' cardiac health prior to surgery, focusing on risks associated with various types of procedures. It highlights ventricular tachycardia and severe valvular diseases like aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis as important conditions requiring examination.

Surgical risk classification is based on potential cardiac complications and hemodynamic impacts, categorized into low, intermediate, and high-risk surgeries:

- **Low Risk (<1% complication rate):** Includes procedures such as breast, dental, eye, minor orthopedic, and urological surgeries.
- **Intermediate Risk (1%-5% complication rate):** Encompasses abdominal, carotid, major neurological, renal, and liver transplants.
- **High Risk (>5% complication rate):** Involves aortic and major vascular surgeries.

The decision-making process considers the heart's reserve capacity, which is sensitive to changes in blood pressure influenced by factors like blood loss, volume resuscitation, surgery-related inflammation, and medications.

Functional capacity is assessed using metabolic equivalents (METs), with four or more METs indicating good surgical tolerance. However, low MET scores may not strongly predict outcomes, requiring careful consideration of other health issues such as musculoskeletal disorders or lung capacity problems.

Before managing clinical risk factors, it's essential to evaluate patient-specific functional capacities and consider various predictive indices like the Predictive Cardiac Risk Index of Lee. While many individual risk factors exist, their correlation with worse surgical outcomes may not be well-established in research.

The text outlines a management approach for assessing and handling cardiac risk factors in surgical patients, based on guidelines by Lee Index and recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA).

### Key Points:

1. **Risk Factors**:
   - Five main risk factors are identified: history of ischemic heart disease, compensated or prior heart failure, insulin-dependent diabetes, renal insufficiency with a creatinine level above 180 mmol/L or 2 mg/dL, and cerebrovascular disease.
   - Additional considerations include obesity, high cholesterol, and family history of cardiac disease; these are important but not predictive of cardiac complications.

2. **Management Algorithm**:
   - **Emergency Surgery**: If surgery is urgent, manage cardiac status during and after the operation due to potential severe morbidity or mortality.
   - **Non-Emergency Surgery**:
     - Evaluate patients for listed cardiac conditions (e.g., unstable coronary syndromes, heart failure, significant arrhythmias, severe stenotic disease).
     - If any condition is present, consult a physician or cardiologist.
     - For surgeries without these conditions:
       - **Low-Risk Surgery**: Proceed as planned.
       - **Intermediate/High-Risk Surgery**:
         - Assess patientâ€™s functional capacity using metabolic equivalents (METs). 
           - If â‰¥4 METs, proceed with surgery.
           - If <4 METs or unknown status, consider clinical risk factors.
           - If 3+ risk factors, consult a specialist.
           - If 1-2 risk factors, proceed unless consultation might alter management.
         - No risk factors: Surgery can safely continue.

3. **Patients with Coronary Interventions**:
   - Increasing numbers of patients undergo non-cardiac surgery post-coronary artery balloon angioplasty or stenting.
   - Dual antiplatelet therapy is common post-stent placement.
     - Bare metal stents require clopidogrel for at least one month along with aspirin.
     - Drug-eluting stents necessitate a year of dual therapy, making them contraindicated if non-cardiac surgery might occur within that period.

4. **Future Discussion**:
   - A detailed examination of the management algorithm and specific considerations for patients with prior percutaneous interventions will be covered later.

This framework helps clinicians make informed decisions about surgical procedures based on cardiac risk factors, aiming to minimize complications related to underlying heart conditions.

### Summary

The text provides guidelines on managing patients with various cardiac interventions who are preparing for surgery:

1. **Balloon Angioplasty:**
   - If less than two weeks post-procedure, delay surgery.
   - After two weeks, proceed with surgery on aspirin.

2. **Bare Metal Stents:**
   - Delay surgery if it's been fewer than 30-45 days since stent placement.
   - Surgery can be scheduled after 30-45 days using only aspirin.

3. **Drug Eluting Stents:**
   - A waiting period of one year is recommended before surgery.
   - If over a year has passed, proceed with surgery on aspirin.
   - For less than one year post-stent placement, delay surgery if possible.

4. **Preoperative ECGs:**
   - The routine value is unclear; however, they are useful for diagnosing severe arrhythmias.
   - Routine testing often depends on age or patient history of cardiac disease and may include high-risk surgery patients.
   - Watch for major abnormalities like Q-wave changes, ST segment alterations, T-wave changes, MOBITS type 2 or higher block, left bundle branch block, and AFib; refer these to a cardiologist.

5. **Perioperative Management:**
   - Optimal use of statins during the perioperative period is unclear but recommended by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association.
   - The protective effects of beta blockers are noted, though recent findings suggest research irregularities that call into question their use. Guidelines exist for dosages and heart rate targets but lack consensus on timing.

This summary encapsulates current practices and considerations in perioperative cardiac care based on the provided text.

The text discusses recent findings suggesting that beta blockers may increase mortality risk by about 27%, urging caution in their routine use. It highlights the importance of continuing cardiovascular medications through surgery, as stopping certain drugs like centrally acting alpha-2 agonists or ACE inhibitors can lead to severe complications such as rebound hypertension and congestive cardiac failure recurrence. Diuretic therapy requires careful management to avoid hypovolemia and hyperkalemia before surgery. Patients with hypertension may need monitoring and fluid replacement due to their contracted intravascular space during surgery.

The consultation process with a physician or cardiologist should aim to improve the patient's cardiac reserve capacity, reducing surgical morbidity and mortality risks. The consultation algorithm focuses on identifying patients who would benefit from further investigationâ€”such as stress ECGs, echocardiograms, or angiogramsâ€”to alter management plans accordingly. Future discussions will address pulmonary conditions.
