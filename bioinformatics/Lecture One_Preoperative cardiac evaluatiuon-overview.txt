The lecture provides a comprehensive overview of managing patients with cardiac conditions who are being considered for surgery. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating these patients to minimize perioperative morbidity and mortality, streamline processes, and comply with regulatory requirements.

Key points include:

1. **Prevalence**: Between 1-3% of non-cardiac surgeries result in cardiac complications.
2. **Importance of Evaluation**: Evaluating cardiac status is crucial for all surgical patients to ensure good outcomes and efficient resource use.
3. **Regulatory Considerations**: Patient consent and awareness are critical, with protocols often tailored to local requirements.

The lecture introduces a management algorithm based on guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association. This involves assessing:

- Critical cardiac conditions
- Risk associated with different types of surgery
- Functional capacity of patients
- Clinical risk factors

Additionally, the ASA classification system is highlighted as a starting point for preoperative evaluation, ranging from completely healthy individuals (ASA class 1) to those who are brain dead and may be considered for organ donation (ASA class 6).

The algorithm specifically considers active cardiac conditions such as unstable coronary syndromes, recent myocardial infarctions, worsening heart failure, and significant arrhythmias. These factors determine the need to enhance cardiac reserves or potentially modify surgical plans.

The text discusses the importance of evaluating ventricular tachycardia and severe stenotic valvular diseases, like severe aortic and symptomatic mitral stenosis, before surgery. It emphasizes examining heart sounds as part of pre-surgical assessments due to potential cardiac complications from surgical interventions.

Surgery is categorized based on its risk for cardiac complications by considering hemodynamic effects or fluid shifts it might cause. Risk classifications include low-risk surgeries (less than 1% complication rate), such as dental and minor orthopedic procedures; intermediate-risk surgeries (1% to 5% complication rate), like abdominal and major neurological operations; and high-risk surgeries (over 5% complication rate), including major vascular surgeries, often involving patients with existing cardiac conditions.

The text further highlights the importance of assessing a patient's functional capacity in METs to determine their ability to withstand surgery. A good shape is defined as reaching four or more metabolic equivalents, while low scores require careful consideration due to weak correlations with outcomes.

Finally, it mentions various clinical risk factors and predictive indices like the Predictive Cardiac Risk Index, but notes that not all individual risk factors have been proven to correlate with worse surgical outcomes.

The text outlines an approach for managing non-cardiac surgery in patients with various cardiac risk factors. The Lee Index identifies five primary risk factors: ischemic heart disease, compensated or previous heart failure, insulin-dependent diabetes, renal insufficiency (creatinine levels above 180 mmol/L or 2 mg/dL), and cerebrovascular disease. Other important but non-predictive factors include obesity, high cholesterol, and family history of cardiac disease.

The management algorithm starts by determining if the surgery is an emergency. If so, manage cardiac status intra- and postoperatively due to potential severe morbidity or mortality from delays. For non-emergencies, assess whether the patient has any listed cardiac conditions (e.g., unstable coronary syndromes, significant arrhythmias) that require a physician or cardiologist evaluation.

For patients without these conditions, determine the surgery's risk level:
- Low-risk surgeries can proceed as planned.
- Intermediate or high-risk surgeries need further assessment of the patientâ€™s functional capacity. If they achieve four or more metabolic equivalents (METs), surgery can continue; otherwise, consider clinical risk factors.
  - Three or more risk factors warrant consultation.
  - One or two factors allow surgery unless consultation might alter management.
  - No risk factors mean it is safe to proceed.

The text also highlights the increased number of patients with prior coronary artery interventions (balloon angioplasty and stents) requiring careful pre-surgical planning. Recommendations include dual antiplatelet therapy post-procedure, with clopidogrel for at least a month after bare metal stents, or up to a year for drug-eluting stents. The need for non-cardiac surgery within this period is a contraindication for drug-eluting stent placement.

The algorithm from the ACC AHA addresses patients who have undergone percutaneous interventions, dividing them into those with balloon angioplasty only and others, which will be discussed further in subsequent lectures.

The text provides guidelines for managing surgical procedures in patients with different cardiovascular interventions:

1. **Balloon Angioplasty**: 
   - If surgery is required within two weeks post-procedure, it should be delayed.
   - Beyond two weeks, surgery can proceed on aspirin.

2. **Bare Metal Stents**:
   - Surgery should be postponed if performed sooner than 30 to 45 days after stent placement.
   - After the cutoff period, patients may go to surgery with aspirin alone.

3. **Drug Eluting Stents**:
   - A one-year waiting period is recommended before proceeding to surgery.
   - Surgeries are advised only on aspirin if more than a year has passed since stent placement; otherwise, delay is suggested.

4. **Preoperative ECGs**: 
   - Their prognostic value is unclear unless diagnosing severe arrhythmias.
   - Routine testing often depends on age and is recommended for patients with cardiac history or high-risk surgery indications.
   - Abnormalities like major Q-wave changes, ST segment changes, major T-wave changes, Mobitz type 2 blocks, left bundle branch block, and AFib should prompt referral to a specialist.

5. **Perioperative Statin Use**:
   - Optimal dosage and timing are unknown, but continuation during the perioperative period is advised by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.

6. **Beta Blockers**:
   - Despite their protective effects for at-risk patients being well-documented, recent revelations about research irregularities have cast doubt on some recommendations.
   - Dosing and timing protocols were previously detailed but may need reevaluation in light of new findings.

This summary encapsulates the guidelines while noting the ongoing uncertainty surrounding certain practices.

The text discusses concerns regarding the routine use of beta blockers, suggesting they may increase mortality risk by about 27%. It advises caution and reevaluation of their use while highlighting that cardiovascular medications should generally continue through the perioperative period. The discontinuation of certain drugs like centrally acting alpha-2 agonists or ACE inhibitors can lead to severe health issues such as rebound hypertension and recurrence in congestive cardiac failure, respectively. Diuretic therapy requires careful management to prevent hypovolemia and hyperkalemia before surgery. Patients with hypertension need close monitoring during surgery due to potential blood and fluid loss. The goal of preoperative consultations is not only to clear patients for surgery but also to adjust their cardiac management to improve reserve capacity and reduce surgical risks. Identifying patients who may benefit from further non-invasive or invasive investigations to change their treatment plan is crucial, with decisions on stress ECGs, echocardiograms, or angiograms left to the cardiologist's discretion. The next lecture will cover pulmonary conditions.
