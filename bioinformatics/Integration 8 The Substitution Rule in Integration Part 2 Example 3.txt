Here's our next example. We asked to get the indefinite integral of the product of two functions, x squared and the sine of x cubed.
What we do need to do is keep our eyes peeled for the possibility of using substitution.
We have x to the power 3 and its derivative which is 3x to the power 2. Certainly the x to the power 2 appears in the other function.
So let's use substitution. Let u be x cubed du dx would thus be 3x squared.
Now let's look at what we can substitute. If we could get dx x squared on its own, we'll have something to substitute.
Or the maximum amount of things that we can substitute.
So if we let du then be 3x squared dx, we can bring the 3 across so that will be a third du equals x squared dx.
So we have a lot of things we can substitute now. We have an x squared dx and there's our x squared dx.
And we have an x cubed for which we're going to substitute a u.
So rewriting would be the indefinite integral of the sine of u. We're going to have a third and we're going to have du.
So all we did is substitute all the values that we had. With the constant value rule we can bring out the third indefinite integral of the sine of u with respect to u.
That'll be a third. The antiderivative of the sine of u would be negative the cosine of u.
And this is indefinite so plus c. A third. Let us bring back our substitution. u was x cubed plus c.
That equals negative a third times the cosine of x cubed plus c.
so we're gonna be adding a third time to the sine of u.
So let's walk in the realce.
