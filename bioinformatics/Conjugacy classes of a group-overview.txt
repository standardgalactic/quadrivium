The text discusses conjugacy classes within group theory and their relationship to orbits. Here’s a summary:

1. **Conjugacy Classes as Orbits**: The author claims that conjugacy classes in a group are essentially the same as orbits of the set formed by the group itself under specific actions.

2. **Definition via Group Action**: A conjugacy class of an element \(a\) is defined by taking all elements \(g\) from the group and acting on \(a\) using the operation \(g \cdot a \cdot g^{-1}\).

3. **Partitioning the Group**: It’s stated that these conjugacy classes can partition the entire group. This means every element of the group belongs to exactly one conjugacy class.

4. **Demonstration of Partition Property**:
   - By taking any element \(a\) and considering its conjugate under all elements \(g\), you form a conjugacy class.
   - If another element \(b\) is not in this class, then it must belong to a different conjugacy class, ensuring disjoint sets.

5. **Proof of Consistency**:
   - The proof involves showing that for any element \(a\) and any specific group elements used for conjugation, the resulting set remains consistent.
   - This consistency relies on properties like those from Cayley's theorem, which states that a group can be represented as permutations of itself.

6. **Conclusion**: Regardless of the starting element within a conjugacy class, applying the group action results in the same set, confirming the well-defined nature of these classes and their role in partitioning the group.

This explanation ties the concept of conjugacy to the broader framework of group actions and partitions, emphasizing how every element is uniquely classified within its conjugacy class.

The text discusses a process involving group theory, focusing on the relationship between two sets \( C_A \) and \( C_B \), which are conjugacy classes within a group \( G \). Here's a summary:

1. **Definitions and Setup**: 
   - Define \( B \) as \( g^* \).
   - Consider elements of the form \( g^* B g^{*-1} \).

2. **Disjoint Conjugacy Classes**:
   - If \( C_A \cap C_B \neq \emptyset \), then an element in this intersection must belong to both conjugacy classes.
   - This implies that if not disjoint, one class is actually a subset of the other.

3. **Expression for \( B \)**:
   - By composing with \( g^{*-1} \) and using group properties (like associativity), simplify to show \( B = b \).
   - Rewrite expressions involving inverses and conjugates to demonstrate that if \( B \) is in a class of \( A \), then it must be in \( A \).

4. **Conjugacy Classes Partitioning**:
   - If \( C_A \cap C_B \neq \emptyset \), then \( B \) must be in \( A \), meaning the classes are not disjoint.
   - This leads to the conclusion that conjugacy classes partition the group \( G \).

5. **Special Case with Center of \( G \)**:
   - If \( A \) is an element of the center of \( G \), then any element commutes with all elements in \( G \).
   - This implies each conjugacy class containing a central element is just the singleton set containing that element.

Overall, the text explains how conjugacy classes relate to each other and partition a group, emphasizing the role of the group's center.

The text discusses the concept of commutativity and conjugacy classes within group theory. It starts by explaining that if for every element \( S \) in a group \( G \), composing an element \( G \) with \( S \) yields the same result as composing \( S \) with \( G \), then there is commutativity. This implies that elements can be swapped in operations without changing the outcome.

The text further explains that if you take an inverse of an element \( G \) and compose it with another element \( A \), you end up just with \( A \). If \( A \) were in the center of the group, it would remain unchanged regardless of which elements are composed around it. Consequently, \( A \) would be the only element in its conjugacy class.

However, if \( A \) is not in the center of \( G \), then choosing such an \( A \) leads to a more interesting scenario where different elements fall into distinct conjugacy classes. Each element chosen will belong to one specific conjugacy class, and these classes are disjoint from each other.

In summary, the text describes how commutativity affects group operations and explains the concept of conjugacy classes, emphasizing that non-central elements lead to multiple distinct and non-overlapping conjugacy classes within a group.
