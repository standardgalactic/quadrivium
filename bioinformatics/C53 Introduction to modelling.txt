In this section we're going to have a look at a few physical problems and see if we can use all
the techniques that we've learned about in the previous chapters to solve these problems. Now
the differential equations we know by now can serve as mathematical models. Now the equations
that we're going to use is most of the time your note will be in this form. It's linear. It's usually
up to second order. We'll start a bit lower but second order and with constant coefficients and
with y being a function of t there or usually it'll be x prime prime x prime and x as a function of t.
Now a variety of models can be can be solved by or explained by this linear differential equation.
And in all of these you see the springs electrical circuits it's only the terminology and the physical
interpretation that changes changes but the mathematical equation is still the same. So
what are we going to look at? We're going to look at some linear models with initial value problems
problems and some linear models with boundary value problems and then finally just a quick look at
some non-linear models.
