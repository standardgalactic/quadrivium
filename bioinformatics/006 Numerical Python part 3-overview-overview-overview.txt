The lecture discusses using NumPy for simple calculus involving polynomials. Key points include:

1. **Polynomial Definition**: Polynomials are single-variable functions with variables raised to integer powers (e.g., \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \)).

2. **Creating Polynomials in Python**: Use NumPy's `poly1d` to define polynomials by listing coefficients from highest to lowest power of x, which simplifies manipulation.

3. **Operations on Polynomials**:
   - **Multiplication**: Multiplying a polynomial by itself yields a new polynomial.
   - **Derivative**: The `deriv` method computes the first derivative.
   - **Integration**: Use the `integ` method for integration, with manual addition of the constant of integration.

4. **Practical Application**: These operations facilitate quick verification of calculus work, such as checking derivatives and integrals on a computer.
