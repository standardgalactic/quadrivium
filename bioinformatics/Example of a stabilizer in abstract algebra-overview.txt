The text discusses the concept of stabilizers in group actions, using an example involving symmetries of a square. The group \( D_4 \), known as the dihedral group of order 8, includes rotations and reflections that map a square to itself. This group has elements: \( R_0 \) (identity), \( R_1 \) (90째 rotation counterclockwise), \( R_2 \) (180째 rotation), \( R_3 \) (270째 rotation counterclockwise), and reflections \( M_1 \) (vertical flip), \( M_2 \) (horizontal flip), \( D_1 \) (flip along one diagonal), and \( D_2 \) (flip along the other diagonal).

The stabilizer of an element in a set under this group action is the subset of the group that leaves the specific element unchanged. The text explores the stabilizers for three elements: corner 1, side 3, and diagonal 1.

- **Corner 1**: Its stabilizer includes \( R_0 \) (identity) and \( D_2 \) (flip along the axis through corners 1 and 3), as these transformations leave corner 1 fixed.
  
- **Side 3**: The stabilizer contains \( R_0 \) and \( M_1 \) (vertical flip), since both keep side 3 in its position.

- **Diagonal 1**: Its stabilizer includes \( R_0 \) (identity), \( D_1 \) (flip along diagonal 1), \( D_2 \) (flip along the other diagonal), and \( R_2 \) (180째 rotation), as these transformations leave diagonal 1 unchanged.

The text emphasizes understanding how each group element affects specific elements of the square to determine their stabilizers.
