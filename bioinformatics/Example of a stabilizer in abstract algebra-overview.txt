The text discusses the concept of stabilizers in group actions, using an example involving symmetries of a square. The group \( D_4 \), known as the dihedral group of order 8, includes rotations and reflections that map a square to itself. This group has elements: \( R_0 \) (identity), \( R_1 \) (90째 rotation counterclockwise), \( R_2 \) (180째 rotation), \( R_3 \) (270째 rotation counterclockwise), and reflections \( M_1 \) (vertical flip), \( M_2 \) (horizontal flip), \( D_1 \) (flip along one diagonal), and \( D_2 \) (flip along the other diagonal).

The stabilizer of an element in a set under this group action is the subset of the group that leaves the specific element unchanged. The text explores the stabilizers for three elements: corner 1, side 3, and diagonal 1.

- **Corner 1**: Its stabilizer includes \( R_0 \) (identity) and \( D_2 \) (flip along the axis through corners 1 and 3), as these transformations leave corner 1 fixed.
  
- **Side 3**: The stabilizer contains \( R_0 \) and \( M_1 \) (vertical flip), since both keep side 3 in its position.

- **Diagonal 1**: Its stabilizer includes \( R_0 \) (identity), \( D_1 \) (flip along diagonal 1), \( D_2 \) (flip along the other diagonal), and \( R_2 \) (180째 rotation), as these transformations leave diagonal 1 unchanged.

The text emphasizes understanding how each group element affects specific elements of the square to determine their stabilizers.

The text provides an explanation of the concept of stabilizers in group theory, using a tangible example involving symmetries of a square. The square has four corners (labeled 1 to 4) and sides, as well as two diagonals. The group \( D_4 \), which represents the symmetries of the square, consists of rotations (\( R_0, R_1, R_2, R_3 \)) and reflections (\( M_1, M_2 \)) along certain axes, as well as diagonal flips (\( D_1, D_2 \)).

The stabilizer of an element (a corner, side, or diagonal) is the subset of group elements that leave that specific element unchanged when applied. Here are the main points regarding the stabilizers for different elements:

- **Corner 1**: The stabilizer includes the identity rotation \( R_0 \), and the reflection \( D_2 \) (flipping across a certain axis), as these operations leave corner 1 in place.
  
- **Side 3**: The stabilizer consists of the identity rotation \( R_0 \) and the reflection \( M_1 \) (across the vertical axis), as both leave side 3 unchanged.

- **Diagonal 1**: The stabilizer includes the identity rotation \( R_0 \), a flip across diagonal 1 (\( D_1 \)), a flip across the perpendicular diagonal (\( D_2 \)), and a 180-degree rotation (\( R_2 \)). These operations leave diagonal 1 in place.

The text encourages understanding these examples to grasp what stabilizers are within the context of group actions on sets.
