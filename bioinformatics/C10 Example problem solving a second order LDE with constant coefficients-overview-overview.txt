The text outlines solving a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation using an auxiliary equation approach. Given the quadratic equation \( am^2 + bm + c = 0 \), with specific values \( b = -10 \) and \( c = 25 \), it calculates the discriminant as zero (\(100 - 100\)), indicating repeated roots. The equation simplifies to \( m^2 - 10m + 25 = 0 \), factoring into \( (m-5)^2 = 0 \), yielding a double root of \( m_1 = m_2 = 5 \).

For equations with repeated roots, the solution is expressed as:

\[ y = c_1 e^{m_1 x} + c_2 x e^{m_1 x} \]

Thus, for this specific case, the solution becomes:

\[ y = c_1 e^{5x} + c_2 x e^{5x} \]
