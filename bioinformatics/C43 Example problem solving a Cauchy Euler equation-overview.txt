The text explains how to solve a specific type of differential equation known as the Cauchy-Euler equation, which is linear, homogeneous, and has non-constant coefficients. The solution approach involves assuming solutions in the form \( y = x^m \). By substituting this assumed form into the equation, it simplifies to a characteristic polynomial: \( m^2 - m - 2 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic gives roots \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = 2 \). Therefore, the general solution for the differential equation is expressed as \( y = c_1 x^{-1} + c_2 x^2 \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. This method leverages the specific structure of Cauchy-Euler equations to find solutions efficiently.

The text describes solving a specific type of differential equation known as the Cauchy-Euler equation, which is linear, homogeneous with non-constant coefficients. The solution approach involves assuming solutions of the form \( y = x^m \). Substituting this into the differential equation results in a characteristic equation for \( m \): 

\[ m^2 - m - 2 = 0. \]

Solving this quadratic equation yields roots \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = 2 \). Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is:

\[ y = c_1 x^{-1} + c_2 x^2, \]

where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. This process demonstrates a straightforward method for solving Cauchy-Euler equations by leveraging their specific structure.
