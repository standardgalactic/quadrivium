Now let's have a look at this system of linear equations.
We've actually seen this before when we looked at real world examples.
It was a salt water solution running in and out of a tank.
And we have these two independent variables and the derivative
in this linear system and these initial values.
Another reason to do a problem like this is just to get used to different forms
of writing these variables. Instead of x and y we have
x sub 1 and x sub 2. First thing to do
and I've already done the first bit of it is just to write it in differential
form. So write any linear system for now
in differential form first. So I've brought
everything over to the left hand side for the first one and I can
now take x sub 1 out as a common factor. So I'm going to have
d plus 2 over 25 x sub 1
minus 1 over 50 x sub 2
equals 0.
Let's call that my first equation.
Let's have that as equation number 1 and then
equation number 2 I'm going to have d
of x sub 2.
Bring this over to the other
side so I'm going to have a plus
2 over 25 x sub 2
and I'm going to have a negative 2 over 25 x sub 1.
If I take this all out and I'm trying to put
these in order so I'm going to have
negative 2 over 25 x sub 1
plus I'm going to have a d plus 2 over 25 x sub 2
and that equals 0 and we'll call that equation number 2.
We'll call that equation number 2. First of all though I think
what we can do is let's take equation 2
solve for x2 and then put it back into equation 1.
So in essence what are we going to have?
We're going to have the fact that x sub 2
this is now from equation 2
x sub 2 is going to equal
2 over 25
25
and then this d plus 2 over 25
x sub 1
So I've taken this over to the other side
and I've divided both sides by this
and that is what I'll get
and let's substitute this back into equation 1
So what happens to equation 1?
Where is it? There we go
So it's going to be d plus 2 over 25
x sub 1
minus 1 over 50
times x sub 2
which is now this
which is 2 over 25
d plus 2 over 25
x sub 1
equals 0
equals 0
Now
I suppose we can
we have to rewrite this
until we get this
almost a polynomial
with this differential playing the part
of
a dependent variable
So let's go
d plus 2 over 25
x sub 1
Now I suppose
that will go
and that will go to 25
so that's going to be
minus 1 over
625
1 over 625
and now what I can do
is I can multiply throughout
by this
so that will become
squared
that will go away
that's x sub 1
equals 0
So I'm just doing a lot of stuff in 1
I hope you can still see there
I just multiply it throughout
by d plus 2 over 25
so that will become squared
I've simplified that
it looks like this
I'm going to have the fact that
d squared x sub 1
plus
4 over 25 d x sub 1
plus
4 over 625
x sub 1
minus 1 over 625
x sub 1
equals 0
So I'm going to have
d squared x sub 1
plus 4 over 25 d x sub 1
and it looks like
plus 3 over 625
x sub 1
equals 0
I can see here
it is a second order
linear
ordinary differential equation
with constant coefficients
and a leading one day
I can just make use of
the auxiliary equation
and as much as
it looks like m squared
plus 4 over 25
m
plus 3 over 625
m
is going to equal 0
So let's just use
the fact that this is a
quadratic equation
we're going to solve
we're going to say
m equals negative 4 over 25
plus minus the square root of
b squared
so that's 16 over 625
minus 4 times a times c
that is 12 over 625
divided by 2
divided by 2
so m is going to equal
let's have a look
negative 4 over 25
plus or minus 16 is 4
plus or minus 16 is 4
so that's going to be
2 over 25 divided by 2
so we're going to have
m sub 1 equals
minus 4 plus 2
that is negative 2 over 25
divided by 2
or in other words times a half
and m sub 2 is going to equal
negative 6 over 25 times a half
so m sub 1 is going to equal
negative 1 over 25
and m sub 2 is going to equal
negative 3 over 25
that leaves me with the fact that
x sub 1 of t
that x sub 1 of t
equals c sub 1
e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
plus c sub 2 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
so there we have one solution for x sub 1
now let's go for x sub 2
now what we did here is we just solved for
we just solved for x sub 1
now we have to solve for x sub 2
so what we can do is
I think let's first isolate x sub 1
let's isolate x sub 1 from this first equation
let's do that equation number 1
so if we had equation number 1 here
there we go let's solve for that
so x sub 1 is going to equal
it's going to be 1 over 50 x sub 2
1 over 50 x sub 2
on that side
and that's going to be divided by
d over d plus 2 over 25
x sub 2
x sub 2
x sub 2
x sub 2
x sub 2
x sub 2
oh I should have just said that
x sub 2 equals 0
so that's what it is
that was equation 2
let's put x sub 1 in there
negative 2 over 25
so this is going to be 1 over 50
d plus 2 over 25 x sub 2
plus d plus 2 over 25 x sub 2
then equals 0
again that will go
so it's going to be negative 1 over 625
625 x sub 2
I can multiply throughout by this
so that's going to leave me a d plus 2 over 25
squared x sub 2 equals 0
and I think it looks exactly like we had before
and as much as we're going to have a d squared x sub 2
plus a 4 over 25 d x sub 2
plus a 4 over 625 x sub 2
minus 1 over 625 x sub 2 equals 0
and indeed we have d squared x sub 2
plus 4 over 25 d x sub 2
plus 3 over 625 x sub 2 equals 0
so that's exactly the same
that's exactly the same as we had here
in other words our m sub 1 and m sub 2
is going to be exactly the same
we're going to go exactly through the steps
just with x sub 2
that means we're going to be left with a y
not a y
x sub 2 of t
it's going to be equal to
but this is a linear system
I've already used c sub 1 and c sub 2
so I'm going to have a c sub 3
e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
and a c sub 4 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
let's get rid of this y
so as not to confuse ourselves
so I didn't go through all of those steps
because if you look
except from this being x sub 2
that was x sub 1
but these coefficients in this quadratic equation
call it a quadratic equation
because we're using the differential form
looked exactly like that
so our roots were going to be exactly the same
so I have those two
but what I need is just to express c sub 3 and c sub 4
in terms of c sub 1 and c sub 2
so I'm going to replace these two equations
that I do have for x sub 1 and x sub 2
I'm going to replace them into any one of these equations
let's use equation number 1
equation number 1 says dx sub 1 dt
so let's get that
there was our x sub 1
let's get the first derivative with respect to t of this
so that will leave us with
negative 1 over 25
c sub 1 e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
minus 3 over 25 c sub 2 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
that's the derivative
and now let's just bring this all over to this side
as far as I need to now replace x sub 1
so that's going to be plus 2 over 25
and I've got to replace x sub 1
which was c sub 1 e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
plus c sub 2 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
minus 1 over 25 t
minus 1 over 50 of x sub 2
minus 1 over 50 of x sub 2
which I've just gotten here
which was c sub 3 e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
plus c sub 4 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
and
is that correct?
and let's go to equal 0
so all I have to do now
is just to simplify all of this
I think what I can do immediately
is just multiply through alpha by 50
if I do that I'm at least going to get rid of these
so I'm going to have a negative 2
I'm going to have negative 2
c sub 1 e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
I'm going to have a negative 6
c sub 2 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
plus a 4 c sub 1 e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
plus a 4 c sub 2
because I'm multiplying by 50
c sub 2 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
and I'm going to have a negative c3 e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
and a negative c4 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
and that's going to equal 0
now we just need to group these
so I'm going to have an e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
so what do we have?
we have negative 2 times c sub 1
so that one is gone
plus a 4 times c sub 1
that one is gone
minus c4
minus c4
minus c3
sorry
minus a c sub 3
that one is gone
plus an e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
so that's a negative 6 c sub 2
and a plus 4 c sub 2
and a negative c4
and that has got to equal 0
and that's got to equal 0
so for any value of t
for any value of t
it's easy to see that I cannot get
that I cannot get this term or that term to be 0
so these terms have both got to be 0
so here we have negative 2 times c sub 1
minus c sub 3 is going to equal 0
and here it's negative 2
and this side we have negative 2 times c sub 2
negative c sub 4 is going to equal 0
negative c sub 4 is going to equal 0
so c sub 4
is twice c sub 2
c sub 4 is twice c sub 2
let me just see if I've got this one correct on this side
and it looks a bit
let's have a quick look on this side
let's just have a quick look on this side
let's just have a quick look on this side
c sub 3
c sub 3 equals negative 2 times c sub 1
is that correct?
let me just see if that was negative
that's positive
no, 4 minus 2 is positive
so c sub 3 and c sub 4
I can now replace
so if I write x sub 2 of t
x sub 2 of t
where did I have it before?
let's have a look
we have a c sub 3 there
but c sub 3 is twice c sub 1
e to the power negative 1 over 25t
and we're going to have
plus c sub 4
which is twice c sub 2
negative
negative
negative e to the power negative 3 over 25t
so that was negative
so that is what I have
at the moment for these
now of course
we have the two equations
let me just write x sub 1 of t here as well
so we've got them all together
where did we do them?
that was c sub 1
e to the power negative 1 over 25t
plus c sub 2 e to the power negative 3 over 25t
so there's my two equations
and I've got these two constant coefficients
and I have to solve for those
now fortunately I can
because I have an initial value problem
so let's do that
there's an initial value problem
where we said x sub 1
of 0
so x sub 1 of 0
that was equal to 25
so if I put that in
a 0 in there
if I put a 0 in there
this term becomes 1
c sub 1 plus
same for the c sub 2
so c sub 1 plus c sub 2 is going to equal 25
and as far as x sub 2 of 0 is concerned
that was equal to 0
equal
and let's put a 0 in there
so that is
twice c sub 1
minus twice c sub 2
it's going to equal 0
and the only way that that's going to be
look at that c sub 1 must equal c sub 2
and so 25 is going to equal c sub 1
plus another c sub 1
so c sub 1 is going to equal 25 divided by 2
and that equals also c sub 2
in other words x sub 1 of t
equals 25 over 2 e to the power negative 1 over 25 t
plus 25 over 2 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
plus 25 over 2 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
and x sub 2 of t
is going to equal twice that
so it's
so it's
twice this value because it's twice c sub 1
so 2 times
2 times this is 25
so it's 25 e to the power 1 over 25 t
minus
25 e to the power negative 3 over 25 t
solved
so it takes a long time to do these
how many pages did we use?
quite a few
to this stage but it's just
all the steps that we already know how to do
and we've just got to keep on running through them
keep on running through them
until we get to the
solution
