So in this video we are just going to see how the slope can help us out.
So what we are trying to represent here is this filament and these are little monomers
so they are molecules and what they can do is they can slot into each other.
So what we are trying to represent here is they will start growing and new ones will
attach and attach and attach so the length of it will actually increase.
In other words so many monomers per second will attach but unfortunately there is also
a rate of detachment and very simplistic here it doesn't really work like this but just
just to show very simplistically what is happening.
So we will have this velocity increase in length per second by not our unit length is a monomer
not a centimeter not a millimeter not a micrometer not a unit length is now monomer so so many
monomers per second so we are going to get them to attach so we are going to have this velocity
velocity which is just this growth rate of ours but we also have a little bit of detachment.
Now what we can do is we can look at we can measure this velocity and what we can do is
we can in this bath let's call it a bath with these loose monomers we can measure the concentration
how many monomers per unit volume there is and we can make different ones we can low concentration
a higher higher higher higher higher etc and then we can see what is the growth rate the velocity
versus the concentration and we can see is there a difference if I have more concentration does this
grow faster if I have a higher concentration does it grow slower so I can see is there a relationship between velocity
velocity and you see how I use the term velocity not as velocity of a particle I'm using velocity as
as this monomers per second and my monomer is my unit unit length per second versus concentration and
let's let's just plot that and we notice that here we have the concentration you don't have what you have to
to read this this is the concept here because it's not really to scale or any specific uh process that
we are trying to model here but we see well this is our concentration on the x-axis and our velocity
how many monomers per second on the y-axis and then for each and every concentration we see well that's
the velocity for this concentration that and we plot all of them and we say lo and behold look at this it
looks like there's a straight line I mean they went all full on the straight line because if you do these
experiments there are measurement errors there you can only be accurate to a certain to a certain extent
but by and large we note that this is a straight line now what can we learn from this well we know
how to get the slope of this first of all when it is a slope like this mathematically what are we saying
if we let let k sub p equals the the the the the number of monomers that attach per second
which we have on this y-axis here and on the x-axis we have concentration we say there's a direct
relationship between these one is proportional to the other these monomers that are touching on the
one side and the concentration on the other side if it's a straight line we say there's a direct linear
relation one is proportional to the other and if they are like this you can put in a constant of
proportionality a constant of proportionality so we're going to have this fact that that um
this k sub p equals k sub 0 times the concentration now think about what is going to happen what how
do we determine this velocity well this velocity is going to be how many attach per second minus how
many detach because it doesn't only just grow it shortens a little bit as well unless all happens
dynamically at the same time so it's how many attach per second minus how many we lose per second
now we can't determine think about it we can't determine the how the losses per second because
every time you lose one there's actually one in free concentration so you can never have
a zero concentration because as soon as one falls off another one falls off there's two in that
concentration so it's impossible for us to have zero concentration we can't set up that experiment i'm
saying very simplistically we can't set up that experiment but look at this so we always say well the
velocity is going to be the difference between the two the growth rate the velocity minus the loss
velocity if i can put it like if i can use those words but we've just seen that k sub p equals this
k sub zero which is our constant of proportionality times the concentration very simple algebra minus that
so the velocity is this but velocity we've just seen as a function of the concentration if the concentration
differs the velocity differs we've just seen there so that's that but look at this this is nothing other
than than y equals mx plus c because now i can measure the concentration and i can measure
this velocity what i don't know is this k sub zero which is the slope and kd which is the y-intercept in
other words the rate of loss so i have two unknowns i have two unknowns in algebra that means i would have
to have two equations but i don't need two equations because this actually models a biological process that i can
look at because i know this i know the concentration so i can just use point slope form first of all
y minus y sub one equals m of x minus x one but i can see what m is m is just the slope so k zero k sub zero
equals this slope this rate of change this constant of proportionality i can get that very easily
derived from this line i can also set so i have the slope i have one of the points i can take any of
the points so i can write out my whole equation either that or i can just set my x equal to zero if i
if i have my equation now and i set x equal to zero my c is going to be my y-intercept oh sorry if you
can't see them my c is going to be my y-intercept if i let x equal zero and that c-intercept would very
nicely on my model which i've just gotten now by this equation tell me what this kd or c the the y-intercept
is going to be in other words i even if i can't make a bath and i just call it a bath with a zero
concentration i can't physically create that i can extrapolate from my model what the loss per
second is what this loss per second is so doing this doing an experiment plotting the points getting
a curve from that from the curve i understand what is happening i understand what is happening
from that i write this equation and from that equation with two unknowns i can solve both of
those unknowns and as much as the one unknown is the slope the constant proportionality and
the other one is is what the rate of loss is which will happen mathematically because i can't do it
experimentally at an x value of zero that will give me how many monomers are lost per second okay so this
was your first real introduction of how to construct a mathematical model now this was very simplistic
and idealistic all i wanted to show you is that we can make use of the slope which we now know is the
derivative and the y-intercept of the straight line to construct a mathematical model or an equation
that will give us the solution that will give us the answers that we require
