The text outlines the process for solving a separable differential equation, specifically \( (1 + x) \, dy - y \, dx = 0 \). Here's a summary of the steps:

1. **Rearrange**: The equation is rearranged to separate variables: \(\frac{dy}{y} = \frac{dx}{1+x}\).

2. **Integrate**: Both sides are integrated:
   \[
   \int \frac{1}{y} \, dy = \int \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   \ln |y| = \ln |1 + x| + c_1
   \]

3. **Exponentiate**: To eliminate the logarithms, exponentiate both sides:
   \[
   y = e^{c_1} \cdot (1 + x)
   \]

4. **Simplify**: Introduce \(e^{c_1} = c_2\), where \(c_2\) is a constant that can be positive or negative, leading to the simplified solution:
   \[
   y = c_2(1 + x)
   \]

The solution represents a family of linear functions parameterized by the constant \(c_2\). The absolute value signs are omitted as \(c_2\) encompasses any sign variations.
