In this text, we are analyzing a physics problem involving two carts and their motion before and after a collision. The main focus is on determining the speed of the center of mass for both carts post-collision.

**Part B Recap**: 
- The final velocity of the second cart after impact was calculated to be approximately 1.9 meters per second using given data and previous calculations.

**Part C Analysis**:
- We are interested in finding the speed of the two-cart system's center of mass.
- Given that both carts experience zero acceleration post-collision, we can use linear motion equations with constant velocity for each cart.
- The initial position for both carts is set to zero at the point of collision.

For Cart 1:
- Initial velocity after collision: 0.66 meters per second
- Position equation: \( x_1 = 0.66t \)

For Cart 2:
- Velocity after collision (from Part B): 1.9 meters per second
- Position equation: \( x_2 = 1.9t \)

To find the center of mass velocity:
- Use the center of mass formula: 
  \[
  x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{(m_1 \times x_1) + (m_2 \times x_2)}{m_1 + m_2}
  \]
- Substitute known values for masses and positions:
  - Mass \( m_1 \) is given, mass \( m_2 \) was calculated earlier.
- Derive the velocity of the center of mass by differentiating the position with respect to time:
  \[
  v_{\text{cm}} = \frac{d(x_{\text{cm}})}{dt} \approx 0.93 \, \text{meters per second}
  \]

This approach simplifies finding the center of mass velocity using calculus and linear motion principles.
