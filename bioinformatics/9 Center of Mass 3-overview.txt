In this text, we are analyzing a physics problem involving two carts and their motion before and after a collision. The main focus is on determining the speed of the center of mass for both carts post-collision.

**Part B Recap**: 
- The final velocity of the second cart after impact was calculated to be approximately 1.9 meters per second using given data and previous calculations.

**Part C Analysis**:
- We are interested in finding the speed of the two-cart system's center of mass.
- Given that both carts experience zero acceleration post-collision, we can use linear motion equations with constant velocity for each cart.
- The initial position for both carts is set to zero at the point of collision.

For Cart 1:
- Initial velocity after collision: 0.66 meters per second
- Position equation: \( x_1 = 0.66t \)

For Cart 2:
- Velocity after collision (from Part B): 1.9 meters per second
- Position equation: \( x_2 = 1.9t \)

To find the center of mass velocity:
- Use the center of mass formula: 
  \[
  x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{(m_1 \times x_1) + (m_2 \times x_2)}{m_1 + m_2}
  \]
- Substitute known values for masses and positions:
  - Mass \( m_1 \) is given, mass \( m_2 \) was calculated earlier.
- Derive the velocity of the center of mass by differentiating the position with respect to time:
  \[
  v_{\text{cm}} = \frac{d(x_{\text{cm}})}{dt} \approx 0.93 \, \text{meters per second}
  \]

This approach simplifies finding the center of mass velocity using calculus and linear motion principles.

The text outlines a physics problem involving two carts undergoing a collision and subsequent motion analysis. Initially, it describes how to determine the speed of Cart 2 after the impact using a previously derived equation and known variables. The focus then shifts to Part C, where the center of mass's velocity for both carts is calculated.

For this part, since both carts experience zero acceleration post-collision (they move at constant velocities), the problem uses linear motion equations with no acceleration. By setting initial positions and times at the collision point, it calculates the positions \(x_1\) for Cart 1 and \(x_2\) for Cart 2 as functions of time \(t\). The center of mass velocity is then determined using these position equations and the masses of both carts.

The center of mass velocity is found by taking the derivative of the center of mass's position equation with respect to time, resulting in a constant velocity of approximately 0.93 meters per second. This approach simplifies the problem using calculus concepts once the setup is understood.
