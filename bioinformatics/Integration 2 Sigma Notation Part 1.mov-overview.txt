The text provides a brief overview of sigma notation, which is a compact way to represent the sum of elements in a sequence. Sigma notation involves using a variable, typically "k," which increments by one across each term. The value at which "k" starts and ends is specified for each example.

In Example 1, sigma notation represents the sum from k = 0 to k = 3: \(0 + 1 + 2 + 3\), resulting in a total of 6.

In Example 2, it shows the sum of the expression "k plus k squared" from k = 0 to k = 2. This results in the terms \(0 + 0^2 + 1 + 1^2 + 2 + 2^2\), which sums up to 8.

The text illustrates how sigma notation simplifies expressing and calculating sums by using a systematic approach with an incrementing variable.

The text introduces sigma notation, a shorthand for summing sequences where each term involves a variable \( k \). In sigma notation, \( k \) increases by 1 in each successive term, starting from an initial value and ending at a final value. The examples provided illustrate how to apply this notation:

1. **Example 1**: Sum the sequence of \( k \) from 0 to 3. This results in adding the terms 0, 1, 2, and 3, which equals 6.

2. **Example 2**: Sum the sequence of \( k + k^2 \) from 0 to 2. The terms are calculated as 0 + 0², 1 + 1², and 2 + 2², resulting in 0, 2, and 6 respectively. Adding these gives a total of 8.

The text emphasizes the process of incrementing \( k \) and calculating each term to find the sum for given ranges.
