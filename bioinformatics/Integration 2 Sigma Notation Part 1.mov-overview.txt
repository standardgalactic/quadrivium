The text provides a brief overview of sigma notation, which is a compact way to represent the sum of elements in a sequence. Sigma notation involves using a variable, typically "k," which increments by one across each term. The value at which "k" starts and ends is specified for each example.

In Example 1, sigma notation represents the sum from k = 0 to k = 3: \(0 + 1 + 2 + 3\), resulting in a total of 6.

In Example 2, it shows the sum of the expression "k plus k squared" from k = 0 to k = 2. This results in the terms \(0 + 0^2 + 1 + 1^2 + 2 + 2^2\), which sums up to 8.

The text illustrates how sigma notation simplifies expressing and calculating sums by using a systematic approach with an incrementing variable.
