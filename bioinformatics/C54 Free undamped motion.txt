Now the first linear model that we are going to look at is free undamped motion.
So that will be akin to a spring, a mass just hanging from a spring and pull down a little
bit and let go so it's going to oscillate up and down and for now in this first example we imagine
that there is no external force, in other words there is no friction, there is no air resistance
and certainly no changes in the spring itself so that it can indefinitely just move up and
down, down to the same spot, up to the same spot to infinity which is a bit unrealistic
but let's construct using this linear second order differential equation with constant
coefficients of ours to see if we can get to an equation which at any time t will tell
us at what position we will find this mass.
Now as I said we are going to use this equation but most of these will have initial values.
So at time equals zero this position of ours would be called y sub zero, the first derivative
of position we know is velocity and we are going to have some velocity at time equals zero.
Imagine that spring is hanging there and instead of just letting it go so it can go up I give
it some velocity either pushing it down letting it go or shoving it upwards as I let it go so
it has some initial velocity as opposed to a zero velocity when you just let it go.
So we have to start with Hooke's law and Hooke's law says within the constraints of not over
stretching spring that the restoring force so if I would pull a spring out it will want to go back and
that is proportional to the distance that I pull it out and I can then therefore introduce a constant of
proportionality we'll call it k which is the spring constant and that describes the spring completely.
So for instance if I hang 10 newtons worth of weight from the spring and it pulls that spring out 5
centimeters there then I can just have k equals f divided by s so that's 10 divided by 0.05 newtons per meter
and that would be my spring constant. To get to an equation for free undamped motion or oscillatory motion
I need Newton's second law as well. Now let's just consider downwards downwards towards the paper as the
positive direction and as you can see we're calling this up and down motion x in these examples.
So there'll be this restoring force in the spring equal to ks and I will note later on it's negative ks
because we're taking positive in the downward direction so upward is negative and the mass that
we hang from the end of the spring well we know that that's equal to mg the mass of the object times
the gravitational acceleration the g. So at equilibrium I've put the block on it hangs there and it stands
still at equilibrium mg has got to equal ks or mg minus ks mg is positive ks is negative if I had two vectors
that's going to be zero. Now there's going to be a new force now obviously because that spring there's
going to be a new restoring force and as much as that spring has now been pulled down an extra bit of
distance so now we're going to have this restoring force being negative kx plus s it's going to be the new
upward force on that spring now because there is this resultant
I've pulled it down and I'm holding it there so from the equilibrium position which which already has
at that equilibrium force pulling up the weight pulling down now I pull it down so there's going
to be now a new restoring force because of this extra distance I've pulled it down and this distance is
positive x so I've got to add the two distances now that this s that it was an equilibrium plus this extra x
that I'm moving it so that's going to be the new restoring force but there is not equilibrium between
these forces they don't cancel out anymore as it was there in equilibrium now the force in the
negative direction is going to be more it's going to pull this mess up as soon as I let go so that's
going to give us some form of resultant force now force equals mass times acceleration which I have there
m and then that's the second derivative in time of the position that's acceleration so it's negative kx
x plus s in the negative direction and still the mg down and just a very simple algebra so I've just expanded
there but I do remember something I know that mg equals ks or mg minus ks is zero so this mg minus ks
that goes to zero or that is zero so we're left with m x the m x prime prime equals negative kx
well I can bring that to the other side and I've got this homogeneous equation and if I divide throughout
by this constant mass is a constant here I'm left with this second order linear differential equation
with constant coefficients and it's homogeneous now we'll see later that we can describe k over m as
this omega squared and omega is the angular velocity well I should say angular frequency the circular
frequency is not velocity the circular frequency in other words if I let this go up and down or we've all
seen that if you have a circular motion and instead of viewing that circular motion uniform circular motion
instead of viewing it side on like this if we started to view it edge on this is all you'll see
so any kind of oscillatory motion like this if you viewed it from the side would be this
and if you took any spot it goes around the circle at some radians per second okay that is the angular
frequency now that's radians per second um as far as the velocity is concerned but the frequency of
is concerned is in in in seconds how many radians a change in radians will take place okay
not important for understanding this linear equation but we for simplicity's sake set
the spring constant divided by the mass equal to omega that's lowercase omega squared so we're just
rewriting k over m then as omega squared now we can just rewrite this as x prime prime omega squared x
we can write it in differential form which will be that because it's homogeneous we can write the
auxiliary equation which is going to leave us with m being positive or negative omega i which we know now
we can solve as with alpha being zero as c sub 1 cosine omega t and c sub 2 sine of omega t
now the period of oscillation so we've it's beautiful listen as much as now we have
now we have an equation for x at any time t i can work out exactly where this mass will be
so the period of oscillation now if we just look at a sine curve here remember the period of oscillation
is is how long it takes for one complete wave so from any point up down back to that point how long
that will take and that is 2 pi over omega the frequency is one over the period the frequency is
how many waves are going to pass by per second so if this was moving fast how many times is the
block going to move in the same direction past some observer in one second so that would be omega over
2 pi and i just remind you that omega is then the square root of the spring constant divided by mass
or it's also called the circular frequency of the system
