The text describes a problem involving the evaluation of a line integral around a closed curve \( C \) using both direct calculation and Green's Theorem. Here's a summary:

### Problem Setup

- **Line Integral**: You're evaluating a line integral with vector field components \( m = x - y \) and \( n = xy \).
- **Curve Description**: The path \( C \) consists of three segments:
  1. From (0, 0) to (1, 3) along the line \( y = 3x \).
  2. From (1, 3) to (1, 0) vertically.
  3. From (1, 0) back to (0, 0) horizontally.

### Direct Calculation of Line Integral

- The integral is broken into three segments:
  - **Segment 1**: Along \( y = 3x \), result: \(-2\).
  - **Segment 2**: Vertical line, result: \(+\frac{1}{2}\).
  - **Segment 3**: Horizontal line, result: \(+\frac{9}{2}\).

- Total integral value: \(3\).

### Using Green's Theorem

Green's Theorem connects the line integral around curve \( C \) to a double integral over the region \( R \) it encloses:

\[ \oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \right) dA \]

- **Curl Calculation**:
  - \( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} = y \)
  - \( \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = -1 \)
  - Curl: \( y + 1 \).

- **Region Description**: Bounded by \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \) and \( 0 \leq y \leq 3x \).

- **Double Integral**:
  \[
  \iint_R (y + 1) \, dA = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{3x} (y + 1) \, dy \, dx
  \]

  - Integrate with respect to \( y \):
    \[
    \int_{0}^{3x} (y + 1) \, dy = \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} + y \right]_{0}^{3x} = \frac{9x^2}{2} + 3x
    \]

  - Integrate with respect to \( x \):
    \[
    \int_{0}^{1} \left( \frac{9x^2}{2} + 3x \right) \, dx = \left[ \frac{9x^3}{6} + \frac{3x^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{1} = 3
    \]

Both methods yield the same result: \(3\), confirming consistency and correctness in the calculations.
