The text explains how to calculate the electric potential at a point \( P \) due to an electric dipole, which consists of two opposite charges separated by a small distance. When the point \( P \) is much farther from the dipole than the charge separation (\( r >> d \)), certain approximations can be made:

1. **Approximation**: Because \( r \) is significantly larger than \( d \), the displacement vectors to each charge are nearly parallel, allowing simplification in calculations.

2. **Difference in Distances**: The potential difference at point \( P \) arises due to different distances from the positive and negative charges, which can be approximated as \( d \cos(\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle between the dipole moment vector and the displacement vector to point \( P \).

3. **Electric Potential Calculation**:
   - The electric potential \( V \) at point \( P \) is calculated by summing the contributions from both charges of the dipole:  
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{q}{r_+} + \frac{-q}{r_-}\right)
     \]
   - With approximations, this simplifies to:
     \[
     V = \frac{p \cos(\theta)}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}
     \]
   where \( p \) is the dipole moment (\( qd \)), \( \theta \) is as described, and \( r \) is the distance from the dipole to point \( P \).

4. **Behavior Based on Angle**:
   - The potential is maximum at \( \theta = 0^\circ \), along the axis towards the positive charge.
   - It is minimum at \( \theta = 180^\circ \), along the axis towards the negative charge.
   - Zero potential occurs when \( \theta = 90^\circ \), perpendicular to the dipole axis.

Overall, this explanation highlights how the electric potential depends on both distance and angle from an electric dipole, focusing on scenarios where observation points are far relative to the dipole separation.
