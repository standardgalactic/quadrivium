The text discusses the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field and derives some key relationships. Here’s a summary:

1. **Force and Acceleration**: A force on a charged particle in a magnetic field causes it to accelerate. The centripetal acceleration is given by \(a = \frac{v^2}{r}\), where \(v\) is the velocity and \(r\) is the radius of the circular path.

2. **Magnetic Force Equation**: When this force is due to a magnetic field, it can be expressed as \(F = qvB\), where \(q\) is the charge of the particle, \(v\) its velocity, and \(B\) the magnetic field strength. This leads to the equation \( \frac{mv^2}{r} = qvB \).

3. **Radius of Circular Path**: Solving for \(r\), we find that the radius of the path is \( r = \frac{mv}{qB} \). The radius depends directly on mass and velocity, and inversely on charge and magnetic field strength.

4. **Direction of Motion**: Depending on the charge type (positive or negative) and the direction of the magnetic field, the particle will move in different circular directions (clockwise for electrons if the field is into the board).

5. **Period of Circular Motion**: The period \(T\) (time to complete one full circle) is derived as \( T = \frac{2\pi m}{qB} \). This shows that the period is independent of radius and velocity.

6. **Frequency and Angular Velocity**: Frequency (\(f\)) can be found using \( f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{qB}{2\pi m} \), indicating how often the particle completes a circle per second. The angular velocity (\(\omega\)) is then \( \omega = 2\pi f = \frac{qB}{m} \).

These equations help describe the behavior of charged particles in magnetic fields, relevant to low-speed scenarios relative to the speed of light.

The text explores the behavior of a charged particle moving in a magnetic field and applies principles from classical mechanics to derive important relationships. Here’s a summary:

1. **Magnetic Force on a Charged Particle**: When a charged particle moves perpendicularly (at 90 degrees) to a uniform magnetic field, it experiences a centripetal force due to the magnetic field. This force is given by \( F = qvB \), where \( q \) is the charge, \( v \) is the velocity, and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength.

2. **Centripetal Force Equation**: The centripetal force needed to keep a particle moving in a circular path is also expressed as \( F = \frac{mv^2}{r} \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle, \( v \) its velocity, and \( r \) the radius of the circle.

3. **Equating Forces**: By setting the magnetic force equal to the centripetal force, we derive that the radius of the circular path (\( r \)) is proportional to the mass (\( m \)), velocity (\( v \)), and inversely proportional to the charge (\( q \)) and magnetic field strength (\( B \)): 
   \[
   r = \frac{mv}{qB}
   \]

4. **Direction of Motion**: The direction in which a charged particle moves depends on its charge: electrons move clockwise, while positively charged particles move counterclockwise when the magnetic field is directed into the plane.

5. **Period and Frequency**:
   - **Period (\( T \))**: The time taken for one complete revolution around the circle is independent of velocity or radius, given by 
     \[
     T = \frac{2\pi m}{qB}
     \]
   - **Frequency (\( f \))**: This is the number of revolutions per second and is calculated as 
     \[
     f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}
     \]

6. **Angular Velocity (\( \omega \))**: The angular velocity, or how fast the particle rotates around the circle, can be expressed as:
   \[
   \omega = \frac{qB}{m}
   \]

These equations are crucial for understanding motion in a magnetic field and apply under conditions where the speed of particles is much less than the speed of light.
