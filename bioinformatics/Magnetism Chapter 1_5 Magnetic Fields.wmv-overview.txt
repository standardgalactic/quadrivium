The text discusses the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field and derives some key relationships. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Force and Acceleration**: A force on a charged particle in a magnetic field causes it to accelerate. The centripetal acceleration is given by \(a = \frac{v^2}{r}\), where \(v\) is the velocity and \(r\) is the radius of the circular path.

2. **Magnetic Force Equation**: When this force is due to a magnetic field, it can be expressed as \(F = qvB\), where \(q\) is the charge of the particle, \(v\) its velocity, and \(B\) the magnetic field strength. This leads to the equation \( \frac{mv^2}{r} = qvB \).

3. **Radius of Circular Path**: Solving for \(r\), we find that the radius of the path is \( r = \frac{mv}{qB} \). The radius depends directly on mass and velocity, and inversely on charge and magnetic field strength.

4. **Direction of Motion**: Depending on the charge type (positive or negative) and the direction of the magnetic field, the particle will move in different circular directions (clockwise for electrons if the field is into the board).

5. **Period of Circular Motion**: The period \(T\) (time to complete one full circle) is derived as \( T = \frac{2\pi m}{qB} \). This shows that the period is independent of radius and velocity.

6. **Frequency and Angular Velocity**: Frequency (\(f\)) can be found using \( f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{qB}{2\pi m} \), indicating how often the particle completes a circle per second. The angular velocity (\(\omega\)) is then \( \omega = 2\pi f = \frac{qB}{m} \).

These equations help describe the behavior of charged particles in magnetic fields, relevant to low-speed scenarios relative to the speed of light.
