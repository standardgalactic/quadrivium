The text outlines a process for solving the second-order differential equation \( y'' = 4y' - 4y \) using Euler's method by converting it into two first-order equations. This transformation involves setting \( y' = u \), which leads to the system of equations:

1. \( u' = 4u - 4y \)
2. \( y' = u \)

The initial conditions are given as \( y(0) = 1 \) and \( y'(0) = 2 \). The numerical solution is computed using Euler's method with a step size of 0.01.

Steps involved in the procedure:
- Initialize variables: \( x_0 = 0 \), \( y_0 = 1 \), and \( u_0 = 2 \).
- Use a loop to iterate from \( x = 0 \) to \( x < 1 \). In each iteration, update the values of \( y \) and \( u \) using:
  - \( y_{\text{new}} = y + u \times \Delta x \)
  - \( u_{\text{new}} = u + (4u - 4y) \times \Delta x \)

- The results are printed in a tabulated format, showing the values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( u \) at each step.

The script is written in Python, ensuring that all calculations are performed as floating-point operations to maintain precision. The output demonstrates how Euler's method can be applied to approximate solutions for differential equations over a specified interval.
