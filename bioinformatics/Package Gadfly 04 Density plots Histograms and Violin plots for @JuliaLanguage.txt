so let's have a look at a density plot it's another type of geometry now remember what a
density plot is it takes a continuous variable on the x-axis and it creates this density estimate
so plot again it's data aware so i pass the data frame data frame df data frame to it and on the
x-axis i want age and the geometry for all the age variables is the density i'm going to give
it a guide.title age distribution and again for theme what i usually do color grid color grid focus
both white just to make everything disappear and then line width because density plots are lines and
i'm going to give it quite a thick line at four pixels let's wait for that to render from julia box
and there we see so it takes this continuous variable called age and it gives us this kernel density
estimate plot so we can see the age distribution of our data set now i can add another dimension to
this data by color now it uses the term color but remember it doesn't really have anything to do
with color it just states that i want to to add another dimension so i'm going to look at age again
but i'm going to break it up by gender so every gender male and female with will have its own
kernel density estimate again the geometry is density i'm going to give it a new title and everything else
we have seen before this time i'm not passing a line width argument so it's going to be nice
thin little lines which is the default let's have a look there we go so by color it found it found two
different entries male and female and it gives us this little key it found f and m and it added these
default colors for us let's carry on let's just look at another one this time i'm going to use category
three just because remember there were some more there were more categories there were three different
ones p q and r and you'll see it'll do for the age distribution it'll do a kernel density estimate
the probability plot there of of density plot i should say of all three of these of these categories
let's look have a look at one more and this time is variable two by distribution in the categories
let's have a look at that so we can we can have a look we can see this this is much there's a as far
as variable two is concerned it has a more normal distribution perhaps than the age distribution that
was not did not follow a normal distribution so it helps us really to have a closer look at this data
perhaps give us slightly more information than just the box plots themselves so let's move on to
histogram which is basically a density plot well i mean it's it's a bit more involved than that but
we're just going to make little bins still out of continuous variable on the x-axis so it's it's almost
exactly the same so instead of age i'm using variable one year on the x-axis which is a continuous variable
and i'm passing the geometry to it as geom.histogram i'm giving it a title and i'm using some theme
arguments there as well let's have a look at that variable one let's have a look at what it's just
distribution was seems to be quite random variable one's not really following a distribution pattern
but it is a continuous variable here at the bottom and it has decided on its own what the size of these
little bins are see these are how thin they are that is a count of how many values occur between
two sets of x-axis values that's what a histogram is but i can specify the bin count in the histogram
geometry bin count equals and i've passed the value of 10 here which is going to take this variable
instead of having these tiny little bins we see the bins are quite a bit bigger quite a bit bigger
once again we can see here that the data is really not normally distributed so let's have a look at this
let's have a look at variable two we saw that it had a more normal distribution let's use 11 bin counts
let's have a look at that and there we go we see that normal distribution that we saw on the
kernel density estimate before let's look at variable two but we add another dimension to it i want
two histograms i'm going to split them up by color because i know it's no it's two because i know there
was male and female so let's have a look at what gatfly does there beautifully it will plot one on top of
the other again i've specified a bin count this time 21 and it will plot one in front of the other so
that you could see the both of them size have both histograms there together now a violin plot
combines actually what we saw in the box and whisker plots with a density estimate it actually just
puts a density estimate on its side and duplicates it on both sides so you get this nice little
idea let's have a look at it i'll show you remember category for remember category two that's going to be
my x-axis so this is like a box plot and on the y we're going to take variable one and the geometry
is violin let me show you what it looks like in case you are not familiar with a violin plot so there we
are so on the side here you can see the little kernel density estimate but it duplicates it on both sides
so you get this nice little idea of a box plot but indicating the density as well so violin plots are
quite quite a nice thing to do now let's add something else to it i've got category three here
as a as a as a color let's have a look at what happens now
now this is density and that's what i wanted to show you so if you were just to look at these p there's p
and you see the shape of that p and you can well see the shape of it as it lies there and q
you see this big dip in the q and there's that big dip in the q and then you see r this more more
almost not almost normal but more of a normal distribution there to the r variable next up
in the next section we're going to have a look at one of my favorite type of plots a qq plot
