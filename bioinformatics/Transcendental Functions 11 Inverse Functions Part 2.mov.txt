Here's our first example. Find the inverse of y equals x squared. If we look at the domain of y equals x squared from negative infinity to positive infinity on the x-axis, this is not a one-to-one function.
If we restrict our domain to an interval, and let's do that. Restricted on an interval going from 0 to positive infinity, we do have a one-to-one function. Here's our horizontal red line.
And if we look at this orange colored block, which is now our new interval, so we have a new domain, then our horizontal red line will cross our blue, the blue part of our parabola, y equals x squared only once.
So in that new domain, as defined by our interval, it is a one-to-one function, and we can find an inverse of it.
Now, how did we do it before? Well, we just solved for x. So we started off with y equals x squared.
So we take the square root of both sides. So that will be the square root of y equals the square root of x squared.
And that means that x equals the square root of y. And now, what did we do in our previous discussions?
Well, we just changed x and y around. So we said y equals the square root of x.
And that is the inverse of our original function, the f of x. So that's the inverse of f of x if this was the f of x.
And now you can see y. Because we cannot take, well, not for now anyway, the square root of a negative number.
And therefore, the inverse of the function y equals x squared for x greater than or equal to 0 is a restricted function.
And it has an inverse. But the unrestricted function, y equals x squared, is not a one-to-one function and therefore has no inverse.
And this is why it doesn't have an inverse. Because if we let x be less than 0, this would be an invalid function.
But we have restricted it and therefore it has become one-to-one and therefore it has an inverse.
