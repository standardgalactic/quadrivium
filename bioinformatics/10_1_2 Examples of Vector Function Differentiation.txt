Now let's have a look at this example. We have this vector function in time.
Immediately we note this is the type of function we're dealing with.
And we're asked to get the instantaneous velocity vector from that position vector.
So that for us would mean it is still the vector, but we're taking its first derivative,
which we said we're doing the first derivative of each individual component day.
So that will be negative 2 times the sine of t, and that will be 2 times the cosine of t.
So that will be an instantaneous velocity vector.
What is the speed? What is the speed?
Do you remember we said that that would be the norm of this velocity vector?
So we're going to have a square root, negative 2 sine squared, so that's 4 sine squared of t,
plus we're going to have 4 times the cosine squared of t.
And I think you can see we can take 4 out as a common factor there.
That will leave us sine squared t plus cosine squared t,
which is just equal to 1 by the most famous or the easiest of the trigonometric identities.
And that's the square root of 4, which is just 2.
And the speed is always positive.
So what we learned from this is that irrespective of t, t does not appear in our answer,
so the speed is constant.
It's not dependent on the time variable.
Now we're asked to sketch this in a two-dimensional plane,
in a 2D coordinate system, a Cartesian coordinate system.
If we've done enough of these position vectors or these vector functions,
we'll note that this is actually quite easy.
You have to see enough of them to do, to just see this though.
Okay, if we let that is x and that is y, that is x, that is y.
Now what happens if we say x squared plus y squared?
x squared plus y squared, x squared plus y squared,
is going to equal 4 cosine squared, 4 cosine squared of t plus 4 sine squared of t,
which is 1, which is 1, and we note immediately here that we have a circle.
We have a circle, so if we have a coordinate system like this,
our radius is going to be, that's 2 squared, so our radius is 2,
a radius of 2.
So that is going to be a circle with a radius of 2,
with a radius of 2.
It's this position.
And this particle, if that's the position vector of a particle,
is going to go around at a constant speed,
a constant speed, but it's going to have a different velocity vector.
So what happens at, what is going to be the velocity vector at time equals 0?
Velocity vector, that of 0 is going to be negative 2 times the sine of 0,
that is 0, comma, the cosine of 0 is 1, so that's comma 2.
So if we let time, if time equals 0,
if we make that in this direction, our position vector,
if that's our position vector,
because look at it, if we plug in 0 in there,
we have 2 times the cosine of 0, which is 2,
so that's in our x-axis 2,
and in our y-axis we're going to have 0.
So that's our start.
Then we're going to have a velocity vector 0, comma, 2,
so 0 in the x-direction,
and 2 in the y-direction.
So that is going to be our velocity vector right at that time.
Right at that time.
If we have, if we look at what would be,
if we make t equal to pi over 2,
t equal to pi over 2,
what are we going to have?
Let's first look at, let's look at this velocity vector of us,
the sine of pi over 2, sine of pi over 2 is 1,
so that's going to be a negative 2, comma,
cosine of that is 0,
and let's just look at what our position is at that time.
Our position at time, pi over 2,
is going to equal 0, comma, 2.
So that is this point here,
that is that point there,
and it's going to have a velocity vector of
minus 2 on the x-axis,
0 on the y-axis,
that is exactly there.
So you can see,
and this is from first-year physics,
it's quite easy to see
that this particle is moving round and round
at a constant speed,
the ever-changing velocity,
because the direction is always changing,
hence our velocity vector will look different
for each different time value
that we put in there,
and very neatly,
we remember that tangential velocity
of uniform circular motion
is always,
well, it's tangential to,
to the path that we do travel there in the circle.
Okay, now,
we've looked at,
in single variable calculus,
if we have this function,
and if it's differentiable over its whole domain,
remember the x-value is the domain,
then we say,
it is a smooth curve on that domain,
if it's differentiable anyway,
that does not,
that is not the case for,
for vector functions,
here we have a position vector,
vector cosine of,
I should change this,
let's make it,
let's make it,
to the power,
that would be the image
of that position vector,
and it is differentiable,
let's have a look,
we can certainly take the velocity vector of that,
first derivative,
that is going to be negative,
three times,
the cosine squared of t,
times the sine of t,
comma,
and that is going to be,
three times,
the sine squared of t,
times the cosine squared of t,
we use the chain rule for each of those,
and so it is differentiable,
and we see that this first derivative is,
on the domain,
at least from zero to two pi,
all the way around,
it is differentiable,
and it is smooth,
but certainly this is not,
in as much as we have these cusps,
all along,
and certainly,
if we just looked at that,
as x and y,
as an rr function,
we see that it's not differentiable,
so if it is differentiable,
it does not necessarily mean,
that this function is smooth,
whereas for these functions,
as it were,
it was differentiable on the whole domain,
it was a smooth curve,
and certainly that is not a smooth curve,
so when do we say that,
when do we say that we do have,
a smooth curve,
there are two things need to happen,
we have to have two things happen,
first of all,
we have to have that the r prime of t exists,
that it exists,
and it's continuous,
as we have here,
and the other thing is,
it cannot equal zero,
r prime of t must not equal zero,
and certainly,
if I plug in t equals zero there,
I'm going to have a zero,
and if I plug in that zero as well,
we have zero,
where it's at zero comma zero,
and we can't have,
and we can't have that,
remember this is vector zero,
in other words,
remember that the zero comma zero,
because this is an r,
our two function,
there are two components there,
so both of those must exist,
for a vector function to be smooth,
and we see here,
that we do get,
certain values of t,
for which we are going to get the zero vector,
or zero comma zero,
so that is not,
that is not a smooth curve,
or the image of that,
that position vector,
is not a smooth curve,
we do however,
we can however break this up,
and we can say,
that it is piecewise smooth,
piecewise,
piecewise,
piecewise,
so we break it up into pieces,
so if we have t going from zero,
say to pi over two,
if we look at that interval,
we're going to have a smooth,
we have a smooth curve,
and if we take the union,
of all these pieces,
if we do take the union,
of all these pieces,
we're going to have,
a smooth curve,
just the union of all of those,
is this at these,
at these specific spots,
there's something,
yeah,
I needed to add to this as well,
so this has got to be on this,
closed interval,
it has got to exist,
in the closed interval,
and it's not to go,
got to equal to zero,
on the,
on the open interval,
so if we just looked at this,
from zero to pi over two,
it was,
and from zero to pi over two,
remember now,
zero is not included,
so it will be,
zero comma one,
or whatever,
as close to zero,
as you want to be,
but that's going to make this,
not zero comma zero,
not the zero vector,
so it's not,
enough got to,
equal zero,
on this open interval,
and then on this closed interval,
so if I had put these two in,
these two prerequisites in,
the constraints in,
then that's,
this part here,
is definitely a smooth curve,
and I'll have to take the union,
of all four of these,
to make the list,
or to see this,
as a smooth,
as a smooth curve,
now let's look at,
these two examples,
here I have,
that this position vector,
equals t squared,
and 2 a t,
a is a constant,
and well we can,
suppose I would say,
2 doesn't,
a does not equal zero,
some constant there,
but now t is an element,
of the real numbers,
so we really have,
the domain here,
the domain of this,
r of t,
it's this negative infinity,
to infinity,
so the whole,
it includes all values of t,
so we remember,
we said for this to be,
what we're trying to show,
is that these two functions,
are smooth functions,
so remember what,
we had the two criteria,
that the first derivative,
has to exist,
so let's do that,
that is going to equal to t,
and this is going to equal to a,
so it does exist,
that's number one,
and that has got to be,
on the closed interval,
of this domain,
well this is open anyway,
because we're going from negative,
to positive infinity,
and it's never going to equal zero,
well remember we said,
a is not zero,
it's a point,
with some constant,
so even if I plug in,
t equals zero,
it'll be zero comma,
but on the right hand,
or the y value,
will never be zero,
it'll never be zero,
so we will never have,
the situation here,
that the r prime of t,
equals the zero vector,
because we're always going,
to have a value there,
in other words,
this,
and as I said,
once you've done enough of this,
you'll recognize that,
is a parametrization,
of a parabola,
this is going to be a parabola,
now here we have,
this function,
three,
because we have cosine of t,
sine of t,
and now we can see there,
another t,
so let's see if that's smooth,
now what that is,
is a helix,
remember the cosine of t,
the sine of t,
makes it a circle,
with a radius of one,
because we can say,
x squared plus y squared,
that's going to equal one,
you'll notice that,
but there's another t parameter,
so if we're looking,
at a three dimensional,
coordinate system,
that means,
this is going to spiral upwards,
as t increases,
that is the z value,
the z value is going to go up,
and up,
and up,
so this is a spiral,
now let's see if that's smooth,
if that's smooth,
first of all,
now this is for,
t is an element of,
the real,
real numbers,
so all value,
the first derivative of that,
that's going to be simple,
that's negative,
the sine of t,
the cosine of t,
and one,
so,
that exists for all values of t,
so that's,
criterion number one,
and criterion number two,
this,
on the,
on the closed interval,
must never equal,
zero,
but once again,
we might get a zero there,
we might get a zero there,
depending on the values of t,
but there's a one,
so it's never going to be,
the zero vector,
this is never going to be,
the zero vector,
irrespective of what values of t,
we put in,
so we have the two criteria,
this is,
we have the two criteria here,
it's never going to equal zero,
we have the two criteria,
both sides,
so this parabola,
and this helix,
are both smooth,
vector functions,
legs.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
