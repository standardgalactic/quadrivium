The text provides an introduction to transverse waves, which are characterized by oscillations perpendicular to their direction of travel. Key concepts related to these waves include:

1. **Amplitude**: The maximum displacement from equilibrium.
2. **Wavelength (\(\lambda\))**: Distance over which the wave pattern repeats.
3. **Period (T)**: Time for one complete cycle of the wave.
4. **Frequency (f)**: Number of cycles per second, measured in hertz (Hz), where \(f = \frac{1}{T}\).
5. **Wave Velocity (v)**: Speed of wave travel calculated as \(v = f \times \lambda\).

A practical demonstration involves shaking a string or rope to generate transverse waves, highlighting how these concepts apply.

The velocity in a rope can be calculated using the formula:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \]

where \(T\) is tension and \(\mu\) is mass per unit length. This indicates that wave velocity increases with higher tension and decreases with greater mass or longer rope.

An example problem illustrates converting a wavelength from centimeters to meters, reinforcing the use of SI units in wave calculations.

The text also covers calculating wave velocity and tension:

1. **Velocity Calculation**:
   - Given frequency (1900 Hz), calculate velocity using \(v = \text{frequency} \times \text{wavelength}\).

2. **Tension in a Rope**:
   - For a rope with known mass, length, and oscillation frequency, use \(v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}\) to find tension.

3. **Example Problem**:
   - A 5-meter rope with a mass of 1.45 grams oscillates at 120 Hz. Calculate velocity and tension using the given wavelength.

4. **Flexible Cable Example**:
   - For a 20-meter cable vibrating at 7 Hz, calculate wave properties by determining tension as half the weight supported by that section.

The text emphasizes consistent frequency along a wire regardless of measurement point, with relationships \(v = f \times \lambda\) and \(\lambda = \frac{v}{f}\). To find wavelength, determine velocity using mass, radius, and tension. For a hanging wire, tension is half the weight of half the wire (\(g\) being gravity), allowing for wavelength calculation based on consistent frequency and derived velocity.
