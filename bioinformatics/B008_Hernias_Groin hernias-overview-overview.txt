The text provides an overview of groin hernias, their classification according to the NIAS system (types 1-4), and management strategies. Groin hernias are categorized based on anatomical characteristics, with types including indirect (normal/abnormal ring) and direct (with defects in the floor). Recurrent hernias encompass various types like direct, indirect, femoral, and combined.

Clinically distinguishing between direct and indirect hernias can be challenging; thus, surgical diagnosis during repair allows for individualized treatment. Although most groin hernias require repair due to their progressive nature, some may be managed expectantly based on patient risk and hernia specifics.

Repair decisions consider the patient's anesthesia suitability, with regional/local anesthetics preferred for faster recovery. Laparoscopic repair is often favored for primary bilateral or recurrent hernias because of better outcomes compared to open surgery.

Open repairs can use traditional tissue methods (e.g., Shouldice, Bassini) or mesh repairs. Mesh repairs offer lower recurrence rates but risk complications like pain and infection; thus, careful surgical technique and potential prophylactic antibiotics are recommended, though evidence for their efficacy is not conclusive. Mesh placement may be inadvisable if incarceration or strangulation occurs.

The text compares extraperitoneal and transperitoneal laparoscopic techniques for hernia repair, noting the former's better outcomes but greater difficulty due to limited working space. Transperitoneal methods risk intra-abdominal complications.

Key risks during repair include nerve damage (iliofemoral, ilioinguinal), which can cause numbness or pain, and spermatic cord injury leading to testicular atrophy without typically affecting testosterone production unless bilateral necrosis occurs. Internal iliac artery damage is another serious concern.

Post-operative care for femoral hernia repairs involves checking foot pulses due to potential blood supply issues. Recurrence rates are high with tissue and open repairs but reduced by synthetic mesh usage. An extraperitoneal approach (e.g., Nihus) is advised for femoral hernias to avoid peritoneal cavity entry.

In cases of incarcerated or necrotic bowel, additional incisions may be needed, potentially requiring formal abdominal opening if the bowel returns spontaneously. Confirming compromised tissue condition before concluding surgery is crucial.
