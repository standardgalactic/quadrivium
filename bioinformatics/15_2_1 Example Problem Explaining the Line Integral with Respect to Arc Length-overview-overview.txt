The text explains two methods for calculating the length of a curve lying above an \(xy\)-plane curve within the plane at height \(z=1\), given by parametric equations \(x(t) = e^t + 1\) and \(y(t) = e^t - 1\) where \(t\) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\).

1. **Line Integral Method**: Since the function \(z = f(x, y)\) is constant at 1, calculating the length of the curve simplifies to evaluating the line integral of 1 over the arc length \(ds\), which directly gives the curve's length.

2. **Vector Method**: This involves parameterizing the curve and finding its derivative with respect to \(t\). The derivative \(\frac{d}{dt}(e^t + 1, e^t - 1) = (e^t, e^t)\) has a norm of \(\sqrt{2} e^t\), representing the differential arc length element. Integrating this from \(t = -1\) to \(t = 1\) gives the curve's length as \(\sqrt{2}(e^1 - e^{-1})\).

The text also highlights that the line integral of 1 over the curve conceptually represents both the length and an area under a "flat" shape with constant height 1 above the curve, akin to calculating the surface area of a piece of paper whose base is defined by the xy-plane curve.
