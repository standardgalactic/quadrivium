Here's an example of lower sums, or left Riemann sums.
The area is again divided into four rectangles.
Note though, that the height of each rectangle is taken at the right side of each base.
And that makes the height of the last, or the fourth rectangle, where x equals 1.
In other words, the height is the f of 1, which is 1 minus 1 squared, and that is 0.
This method underestimates the true value of the area under the curve.
Here's an example of midpoint sums, which might turn out to be a closer reflection of the true area in our example.
I think the message is clear though.
To be more accurate, we need more rectangles.
Actually, we need delta x to near 0, or we need the number of rectangles, n, to near infinity.
This will give us a precise area under the curve.
