So now eventually we get to the orbit stabilizer syndrome. There's a lot to write and number one I want to save some time so I've written a few things and number two it is not the easiest thing in the world to understand and the proofs really you really need to concentrate so I want to keep it together.
First of all I just want to talk to you about a new definition of something called an index. An index of the stabilizer remember that's a subgroup of G so the index of a stabilizer in G we write it as G and then the colon G dot A and that just means the number of left cosets I can form.
Remember this is a subgroup of G so if this is G I can form these cosets and the number of these inclusive of this is the index of the stabilizer in G and remember if I have a set A and I have the orbit here's the orbit of A and in this orbit of A there's going to be a number of elements and I can also just express the number of elements there are in the orbit.
So then we just write it with this absolute value sign so I have the number of cosets of G formed by this stabilizer of G and I have the number of elements inside of the orbit of A and what the orbit stabilizer theorem is saying is that these number of cosets equals the number of elements in the orbit of A.
So the index of A so the index of the stabilizer with respect to A and G then is equal to the number of elements in the orbit of A so carefully remember this all elements in the same coset so now I have various elements in this coset of mine what we are trying to say if this is true so if the number here so just to make it easy to understand so I've got one two three four here
and I've got one two three four here so if this four is supposed to equal four here that means every one in here has to go to the same element no matter which element I take here they must go to the same one and if I have one in the other you know take an arbitrary element in one of the other cosets it will have to go to one of the other ones.
So they all going to map to the same elements so all elements in the same coset acting on A an element of A results in the same element in this orbit so they've all got to act on A and give us the same element in the orbit of A that's the only way that the number of cosets here is going to equal the number of elements in the orbit of A.
We've got to prove this so first of all let's just see that all of these in the same coset is going to map to the very same element in the orbit so I've got this taking this G bar and I'm suggesting that it's an element of this stabilizer of A stabilizer of the group with respect to this element A in A so I can form this left coset
so I'm going to take an element G and G compose it with a binary operation G bar and I'm running through all the G bars in that so it's just an arbitrary one but that is my whole my left coset.
Now if I look at this remember this is a subgroup of that so the identity element will be in the identity element composed with it's just going to give me one of these is going to be the identity element composed with G G composed with the identity element it's just going to be G so G is going to be in this G is going to be in this so it's going to act on A and that just gives me A because that's how we defined
that's how we defined this okay now let's take an arbitrary other element in there and let's not just do this one so G O G bar that's an arbitrary element inside of this coset and I'm going to act on A by the first property of group actions this will be G dot G dot A
G bar but remember this thing is part of the stabilizer this is part of the stabilizer so this is just A so this is G dot A exactly the same one it's exactly the same one so no matter which one I take here it is going to map to this very same element in the orbit of A so we've got that
now I just need to show that if I take an arbitrary element I'm going to call it G star and it's in a different coset and I'm going to have to prove that it will then not go to the same as one out in there
so let's assume to the contrary that it does map to the exact same thing so I'm going to say this G which is in here acting on A is going to be exactly the same as G star acting on A
G so I'm saying that they both of them acting on A will give me the same exact element so that's to the contrary and let's see if we can run into a contradiction
so what I've done for you here is left compose with the inverse of G both sides so acting on this element acting on the same element by the first property of group actions I can rewrite it like this so it's the binary operation between those two the binary operation between those two
G inverse composed of G that gives me the identity elements so I have that A equals this G inverse you have to look at this on a big screen to see I don't have a big enough board so that equals this G inverse composed with G star dot A
but hang on a minute that is just the definition of the stabilizer because if I have an element acting on A and it gives me A back that means it must be an element of the stabilizer that's how we define the stabilizer
so that means it must equal this being this arbitrary element in the stabilizer so we have G inverse composed with G and that has got to equal that it is in this element of the stabilizer
and if I left composed with G and if I left composed with G on both sides what do we have left what do we have left here that's just identity element so I have I should say G star there G inverse with G star G inverse with G star
so I have the fact that G star equals G O G that means it must be an element of this so if I take another one out there to the contrary suggesting that they go to the same it actually means no it never came from that one it actually was just one of those
so my assumption to the contrary that they if they are different they map to the same shows no no no if that one is different it is going to go to a different one and that was just arbitrary so if you know if all of these which I've shown on this side they're going to map to the exact same one all of these they're going to go there and all of these means they're going to go there and I have my orbit stabilizer theorem
difficult to get difficult to get you probably have to read your textbook very well listen to your to your to your lecturer watch these videos again but in the end if you watch it long enough you'll see that makes absolute sense and that's a very deep thing that we've got here that the number of cosets formed by the stabilizer is just going to give me the number of elements the index of that so the number of cosets that gives me the number of elements in the orbit of this
is a element of a all mapping to the same all mapping to the same all mapping to the same so the number there has got to equal the number there orbit stabilizer theorem
