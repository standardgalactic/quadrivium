The text describes finding the fourth roots of \(1\) using both algebraic and geometric methods. 

**Algebraic Approach:**
- Express \(1\) as a complex number \(z = 1 + 0i\).
- The modulus \(|z|\) is 1, and the principal argument \(\theta\) is 0.
- Use the formula for the \(n\)th roots of a complex number:
  \[
  z_k = |z|^{1/n} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right)
  \]
- For \(n = 4\) and \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\), calculate:
  - \(z_0 = 1\)
  - \(z_1 = i\)
  - \(z_2 = -1\)
  - \(z_3 = -i\)

Thus, the fourth roots of \(1\) are \(1, \, i, \, -1, \, -i\).

**Geometric Approach:**
- On the complex plane, these roots form a square inscribed in the unit circle.
- Start at \(z_0 = 1\) on the positive x-axis.
- Rotate \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise to get each subsequent root:
  - \(z_1 = i\)
  - \(z_2 = -1\)
  - \(z_3 = -i\)

This confirms the algebraic results, showing that the fourth roots of \(1\) are \(1, \, i, \, -1, \, -i\). The process involves selecting values for \(k\) to obtain these four distinct roots.
