So let's look at an example then of an isomorphism and an isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism
and you'd notice that we had some colored chalk today today we are very very fancy so
let's have a look i've got my two sets here g is this integers mod 4 under addition and h is my
integers mod 5 minus this group minus this congruent set here zero so zero is excluded so
instead of writing each one of these i'm just writing it as as that with the with the line
under just to make it easier my mapping is such so here's my elements in g it is the integers mod
four so that's there the integers mod five one two three four because i've taken away this
congruence class zero so zero maps to one one maps to three two maps to four and three maps to two is
that an isomorphism well first of all you know if it is a bijection it's got to be one to one and onto
and one good way to remember this here is one to one one one to one and here's onto so remember one
one is injective and onto a surjective colored chalk so we have this sort of thing let's make it like
that so here's my domain and i map to but not everything here is being mapped to with onto means
more than one can map to the same element of my second set and then if it is both one to one and onto
there's a direct one to you know direct relationship one for one one for one and it's onto so it's both
of them so if it is going to be an isomorphism the first thing we better just notice is that the set
the size the the size of the two sets are exactly the same so i have four elements in this set and i
have four elements in this set if i start with something that's not like that it's not going to be
an isomorphism so at least you know as far as these examples are concerned that that that is
that is what we need so first i think just as an example just to remind ourselves let's have let's
have a calis table with this and we're going to have one two one zero one two and three zero one two and
three and remember these are all my congruence classes so this should actually be that i'm going to leave
out even the underlines here so zero is my identity element there so that's going to be the same one
plus one is two two plus one is three three plus one is four mod four is zero and then one and two is
three two and two is four mod four is zero it's five five mod four is one and then three and one is four
mod four is two and let's do the multiplication of so this was g let's do h very quickly and we're going
to have one two three and four there one two three and four there and one is for multiplication one two
three four it's my identity one two three four there let's do let's do which one two times one
two times two is four two times three is six mod five is one two times four mod five is three and then
we have three times one is three three times two is six mod five is one three times three is nine mod five
is four three times four is twelve one five is two and four and one is four four and two is eight mod five
is three four is twelve mod five is two sixteen mod five is just a single one so let's just check this
if we have uh if we have an isomorphism so what i'm so what i'm saying here is let's just take any two
two plus let's make it two plus three so if i have two plus three because that's under addition i get
so two plus two plus three is five mod four is one so that's going to give me a one let's see if this
is the same if i do this now and under h so two maps to four that's multiplication for this one three
maps to two and what is four times two so four binary two that gives us three three and so one
better map to three and indeed one maps to three and you can go through all of these and you'll see
that all of them holds and so here we have a beautiful example of an iso effort here is an isomorphism
because it's a one-to-one homomorphism here for g and h and you know try and remember these
what is one-to-one onto that always helps and just always some practice in making these especially
when it's when it's uh when it's uh integers mod n so here we have a beautiful example then of an
isomorphism now for what lays ahead i want you to notice one one extra little thing have you ever
noticed that if i look down any row if i look down any row of these groups
every element in my set appears
and
all of them appear so i have 0 1 2 3 i have 0 1 2 3 i have 0 1 2 3 i have 0 1 2 3
0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3
Have you ever noticed that? That's a very important, that's a very deep thing that's
happening here. And it is used in proofs for instance when we are eventually going to get
to, I'll see when we get to that Cayley's theorem. Cayley's theorem. Here's our Cayley's
table, Cayley's theorem. And we're going to use that sort of thing. But just notice that
it'll also help you when you construct these Cayley's tables that you don't get these,
if that is indeed a group that you don't get repeats, and all of them are there. So
with a finite group of course, you know, if each one is there, then they are not going
to repeat, they are going to be unique because if there is so many and there's no repeats then
they're all going to be there or they're all there, there is not going to be any repeats
because it's finite. But that is something that you can always check on, but it has a
much deeper meaning here. And when you eventually get to Cayley's theorem, that would help us
a lot.
