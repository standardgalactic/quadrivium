In Lesson 4 titled "Functions," the focus is on creating and using functions in Julia. The instructor begins by ensuring that the coding environment is correctly set up with a simple operation (2 + 2). Functions are introduced as essential tools, highlighting their utility and versatility. Instead of starting with generic syntax, an organic learning approach is used.

The lesson covers various aspects of functions in Julia:
- Single expression functions (e.g., \( f(x, y) = x^2 - 3y \)), where inputs like \( x \) and \( y \) are called arguments.
- Multiple expression functions.
- Functions with optional or variable number of arguments.
- Passing arrays as function arguments for multiple inputs/outputs.
- Type parameters, "stabby" syntax, and do blocks.
- Using functions as arguments to pass entire functions into other functions.
- Nested functions (functions within functions).
- Multiple dispatch, a key concept in Julia's optimization.

The lesson also discusses built-in functions from Julia's base system and touches on list comprehensions. The next section will explore single expression functions further, deepening the understanding of function syntax and functionality in Julia.
