Jean, a surgeon with 10 years of experience in South Africa (referred to in America as an attending), writes to Krista King to express gratitude for her YouTube videos on physics and mathematics. Jean has recently organized his life to pursue his passion for these subjects using textbooks. He appreciates the clarity and personal touch in Krista's videos, which he relies on when encountering challenging topics in his studies. Though aware that many others likely send similar messages of thanks, Jean emphasizes how valuable her content is to him and looks forward to watching more as he tackles difficult parts of his studies.
