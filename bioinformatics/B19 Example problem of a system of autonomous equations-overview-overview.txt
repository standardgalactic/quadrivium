The text outlines a demonstration of solving a system of first-order ordinary differential equations using Python's SymPy library within an IPython notebook. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Tools and Setup**: The demonstration uses an IPython notebook with the SymPy library for symbolic mathematics in Python.
2. **Defining Equations**: Two differential equations are presented: \( \frac{dX}{dT} = X + 2Y \) and \( \frac{dY}{dT} = -\frac{1}{2}X + Y \), where \(X\) and \(Y\) depend on the variable \(T\).
3. **Matrix Representation**: The system is represented as a matrix \(A\) derived from the coefficients of the equations.
4. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Eigenvalues \((1 - i)\) and \((1 + i)\), along with their corresponding eigenvectors, are computed using SymPy.
5. **Constructing Solutions**: Solutions for the system, \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), are constructed using eigenvalue-eigenvector methods, involving exponential functions modulated by sine and cosine terms derived from the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues.
6. **Initial Conditions and Solution Expressions**: The initial conditions \( x(0) = 2 \) and \( y(0) = 0 \) are used to solve for coefficients in the solutions, resulting in:
   - \( x(t) = e^t \cos(t) \)
   - \( y(t) = -e^t \sin(t) \)

The author then demonstrates how to visualize these solutions using Python's Matplotlib library. They plot the functions over time with a step size of 0.1 from \( t = 0 \) to just below \( t = 2 \). An initial error due to variable name conflicts is corrected by renaming symbolic variables, and the plot shows the trajectory in red dots.

This process highlights SymPy's capabilities for symbolic computation and illustrates mathematical principles related to differential equations within a vector field context.
