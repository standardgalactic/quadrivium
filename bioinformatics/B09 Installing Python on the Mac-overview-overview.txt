To set up a Python environment on a Mac for numerical calculations related to differential equations using vPython, follow these summarized steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: Upgrade from the default Python 2.7.x pre-installed on macOS Mavericks to Python 2.7.6 to ensure compatibility with vPython.

2. **Installing Python 2.7.6**:
   - Download the installer for Python 2.7.6 from its official site.
   - Modify system settings to allow installations outside of the Mac App Store.
   - Complete the installation, which may require password authentication.

3. **vPython Installation**:
   - Obtain and run the vPython installer via a web browser.
   - Ensure all necessary packages are selected during installation.
   - Authenticate with a password if prompted.

4. **Matplotlib Dependency**:
   - Download Matplotlib compatible with Python 2.7.x for plotting capabilities, as it is not included by default.
   - Install any additional dependencies required by Matplotlib.

5. **Active TCL Installation**: 
   - Download and install Active TCL 8.6.1, which is essential for vPython to function properly.

6. **Challenges**:
   - Be prepared for potential issues with missing dependencies or compatibility due to Python's flexible package system, necessitating additional setup steps.

After completing these installations, the Mac will be ready for coding and performing numerical calculations using vPython.
