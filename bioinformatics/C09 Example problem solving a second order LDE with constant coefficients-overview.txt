The text provides a step-by-step solution to a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE). It describes how to derive and solve the auxiliary equation associated with this ODE. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Identify the Problem**: The given ODE is second order, linear, and homogeneous.
   
2. **Formulate the Auxiliary Equation**: For an ODE of the form \(a y'' + b y' + c y = 0\), the auxiliary equation is \(am^2 + bm + c = 0\). In this case, it's \(2m^2 - 5m - 3 = 0\).

3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**: Use the quadratic formula \(m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) to find the roots:
   - Calculate the discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = 25 + 24 = 49\).
   - Roots are \(m_1 = \frac{5 + 7}{4} = 3\) and \(m_2 = \frac{5 - 7}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Form the General Solution**: Since the roots are real and distinct, the general solution is:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^{3x} + c_2 e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}
   \]
   where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants determined by initial conditions.

5. **Conclusion**: The problem highlights the importance of knowing how to derive and solve auxiliary equations for linear homogeneous ODEs, especially when dealing with real and distinct roots.
