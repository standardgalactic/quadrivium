The text provides a step-by-step solution to a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE). It describes how to derive and solve the auxiliary equation associated with this ODE. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Identify the Problem**: The given ODE is second order, linear, and homogeneous.
   
2. **Formulate the Auxiliary Equation**: For an ODE of the form \(a y'' + b y' + c y = 0\), the auxiliary equation is \(am^2 + bm + c = 0\). In this case, it's \(2m^2 - 5m - 3 = 0\).

3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**: Use the quadratic formula \(m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) to find the roots:
   - Calculate the discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = 25 + 24 = 49\).
   - Roots are \(m_1 = \frac{5 + 7}{4} = 3\) and \(m_2 = \frac{5 - 7}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Form the General Solution**: Since the roots are real and distinct, the general solution is:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^{3x} + c_2 e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}
   \]
   where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants determined by initial conditions.

5. **Conclusion**: The problem highlights the importance of knowing how to derive and solve auxiliary equations for linear homogeneous ODEs, especially when dealing with real and distinct roots.

The text provides a step-by-step solution for solving a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE). Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Equation Type**: The ODE is identified as linear, second order, and homogeneous.

2. **Auxiliary Equation**: An auxiliary quadratic equation \( am^2 + bm + c = 0 \) is set up to find the characteristic roots. For this specific problem, it's given as \( 2m^2 - 5m - 3 = 0 \).

3. **Quadratic Formula Application**: The roots are found using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting \( a = 2 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = -3 \) into this formula, the roots are calculated as:
   \[
   m_1 = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad m_2 = -\frac{1}{2}
   \]

4. **General Solution**: The general solution to the ODE is formed based on these roots:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^{3x} + c_2 e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}
   \]
   This form arises because \( b^2 - 4ac > 0 \), indicating two distinct real roots.

5. **Conclusion**: The solution highlights the importance of understanding how to derive and solve auxiliary equations in second-order linear ODEs, as well as recognizing when different types of solutions (real distinct roots) apply based on the discriminant \( b^2 - 4ac \).
