In this video in the next I want to talk to you about group actions. Now group
actions are not always the easiest thing to understand because when you read a
textbook or when you when you when there's a lecture that sort of goes
quickly over some concepts and you can't really grasp what is going on here and I
want to just use an example. So we use an example because I think it's important
to understand what group actions are. So the idea behind group actions is that we
have. This first video is just going to be about something that's called
faithful group actions. And then I'll just show you some examples in another
video about unfaithful non-faithful group actions. So let's just stick to
faithful group actions. Now don't worry what it means it's this concept of
whatever group action is. And I'm going to have this group G and it's going to have
some set and let's just call that set G just to make it easy and a binary
operation. And then I want another set A and for you know we call it call it a
target set doesn't matter what this is just a set so I just have a set of
elements. And the group action what that is is the is the action of the elements
of the set on the set and what that does is it binds properly together the fact
that each of the elements in this set can be a representation is a
representation of one of the permutations of the set and we've seen
that before. So that's all that group actions is trying to do it is just to show
that there's this connection between elements of a set in a group and the
permutations of another set. And we've seen this before and that was the set A.
Let's have the set A being 1 2 3. So just three elements is not the numbers 1 2 3 just
representing three elements and so three elements meaning I'm going to have six
permutations and they are the permutations and we gave them names before. So we named
that the E that is just the identity permutation takes 1 to 1 2 2 2 and 3 to 3 and this
just swaps 1 and 2 so that was tau 1 2 we called it this swapped 1 and 3 so that was tau 1 3 this
swapped 2 and 3 so that was tau 2 3 and we call this one sigma and if we applied sigma twice
we call that sigma squared. So we've seen that and our group G was made up of these
six elements and each of them was a representation of another set's permutations
and we also showed that if we do a composition of these we'll get a new permutation and that
permutation would have been the same permutation that we've gotten if we did a binary operation
between these two that would have given us another one of these it's a group size closure and that
would have been exactly the same as you know that permutation as the composition of two of these
permutations and we've showed that so we have we know already that this is there's this intuitive
connection between permutations and and elements in a group and that's all the group actions are
saying that there's some action of the group element on a set so there's a group element and it has an
action on a set and it gives me that you know that's that's kind of what we're trying to say here
so what we're going to do is we take we take the the cartesian product of g and a and here i refer to
the s the set of g that one and the group so so if i if so that would just be the set of all elements g comma a
such that g is an element of g set the set that makes up the group and we have and we have a is an element of a
so this whole all these and if we looked at this example that we have here so we'll have e comma one
e comma two e comma three so that would be you know all the e's running just that's one of the g's
running through all the a's and then tau running through all the a's and tau two and what i've done
here is i've just made this tau one tau two tau three sigma and sigma squared so don't worry about that
not seeing the same here so let's just make this tau one and tau two and tau three and that is that you
know that that really is that and all we know all we're going to do now is we're going to have this
mapping let's just call it f and all we're going to do is just map all of these g comma a and we're
going to map them to one of the elements in a and you know this is exactly what we do here and instead
of writing g comma a we usually write g dot a it's just the notation in books just to confuse you so
this would be this would be akin to a dot one and this would be e dot two and this would be say tau
two dot three and what's that going to equal well that equals one that equals two and this one equals
three and so for this tau one which is there what does it do to one it takes one you know it takes
one and it changes it to two so that's going to be two what does it do to two well it takes two to one
and it takes three to stick sticks three to three so for tau two which was this one it takes one
to three it takes sticks two to two uh where are we tau two it takes one to three it stays two stays
with two and three goes back and three goes to one if we look at tau three here one stays with one
two goes to three and three goes to two for sigma one one goes to one goes to two two goes to three
and three goes to one and here one goes to three and two goes to one and we have the fact that three
goes to two there we go so that's all that is happening i'm taking the cartesian product one of these
and i map it onto one of the elements in set a i can also do this see this function sigma g don't worry
about this is not the sigma is not the same as as all of these sigmas and what that can do is it can
map g dot a to a so this this group action of g on a maps back to a so i'm actually just taking one of
these in a map mapping it back to that and we can really show by the fact that we can get this inverse
this inverse
that equals a and let's be the same as sigma g
sigma g inverse of a and by this sigma g dot a by that i mean g dot a
so you know by this i mean g dot a it's just another way of writing this and then the inverse
of that g inverse of that and that would be the same as this way around showing that this is actually
a bijection so that this mapping is actually just just a bijection which we need it to be
what we want to know what we want to say there are two properties two axioms two properties that must
be obeyed if i take g 2 dot a that is going to be you know one of these with one of these
and that's going to give me another one of these and then which will now become one of these and i take
it with that so i do this g1 dot g2 dot ga that that would be the same thing as getting the
which is just g1 g2 dot a you know six just different ways to write it that this was this
is property then number one that must be so that if i were to take the and that's what we just had
when we when we first looked at this if i took the binary operation between any of these two i you
know and looked at what it does to one of the elements that would be the same as if i did this
first i do this get another element plug that three into whatever it was there get that and i'm going
to get the same answer on both sides i think i want to clear the board and actually show you
by one of those that this is actually two true and then just very simply that e dot a must be a
so don't get confused by writing it like this it's just the same thing as writing it writing it like
that but i think you can understand intuitively here that this group action this group action on
another set just think always think of it in these terms the difficult part is just conceptualizing the
fact that we have a bijection here and i've not shown you that these two are actually the same
and this is called a two-sided inverse and in set here if you have a two-sided inverse it
proves that this mapping here is actually a bijection it's just actually a bijection because
what we're mapping here with sigma is we're just mapping a to a and if we're just mapping a to a what
what are we doing we're just creating permutations so all i'm saying here is that we have these
permutations in the next video i'll just show you we just end up with cayley's theorem here actually
because you know we'll have one two three we'll have one two three we'll have um one two three you know
they'll all be there's this permutations of each other these things fit together beautifully for
now just understand this concept of the fact of the action of a group on another set is this
representation of uh this the elements in this group as permutations of this faithful meaning
there's there's a there is a bijection there um and we'll we'll talk about i'll show you that you
can also get non-faithful groups in the next video i just want to clean the board let's just take any
arbitrary ones of those that we'll just take some and just show that this first property does in
fact hold for this so i haven't you know i haven't proven any of this for you i haven't shown proofs
in this video because i just want you to understand really what a group action is it's just connecting
these two to each other and you might get confused just by using this different different notation
to see the notation is just another way to write what is actually just happening behind the
scene so let me clean the board and we'll do we'll do one of these as an example so let's let's let g1
let's have it here g1 let's just make that tau 1 and g2 we'll make sigma and we'll see what happens
there so we're going to take the tau 1 of the sigma of a remember that that would be nothing just saying
that that i'm just taking you know just wondering what what does sigma do what does sigma do to two
and there we go so sigma dot a so where's sigma and we oh we've forgotten to say what a is let's make a
equal to two so we have here we have tau 1 dot the sigma of two so what is the sigma of two yes sigma
sigma of two that is three so that is the tau 1 of three tau 1 dot three so where's tau 1 dot 3 well
that's just equal to three and let's see if we have this tau 1 binary operation with sigma if we have
those and we apply it to you know that to a so what is tau 1 and composed with sigma so tau 1 where we have
where's tau 1 let's just think this through so tau 1 is what did we make tau 1 is tau 1 2 so that was
tau 1 2 so what does that tau 1 2 means it takes 1 to 2 and 2 to 1 and these 3 on its own and sigma
so now sigma sigma was going to be sigma sigma sigma sigma sigma sigma sigma 1 goes to 2 so 1 goes to 2
where's sigma sigma sigma 1 goes to 2 1 goes to 2 2 goes to 3 and 3 goes all the way back to 1 so that's what we have
so with these two combined i actually have 1 2 composed with 1 2 3 and i've got to do that
so let's see what happens here 1 goes to 2 1 goes to 2 and 2 goes to 1 so 1 just actually stays on its own
2 goes to 3 so if i do 2 2 goes to 3 and 3 just stays with the cell so 2 goes to 3 so i'm left just with
2 2 3 so which one of these is 2 3 that was tau 3 so we have tau 3 dot 2 and if we have tau 3 dot 2
that equals columbial 3 exactly the same thing so our property does hold so this is really a representation
this is a group action this is an example because this property holds of a group action on a set so this
property holds and of course if we do this one you know it's always just going to always just going
to have that so that is the that is the the faithful group action on a set of which this is always a
beautiful example but this is all this is the only thing that's happening behind the scenes forget for
forget for a minute just all these you know conceptual proof or these proofs that you have to go through
rather rather just understand what this is this connection between the elements of a group and
each of those of being a permutation of a set and that is a group action on a set
