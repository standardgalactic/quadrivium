The process for finding the particular solution of a differential equation involves several key steps:

1. **Complementary Solution**: Start by solving the auxiliary equation \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \), which factors to \((m-1)^2 = 0\). This gives a repeated root \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \), resulting in the complementary solution: \( c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x \).

2. **Annihilator Operator**: Identify an annihilator operator for the non-homogeneous term on the right-hand side of the equation, using parameters (\(\alpha = -2\), \(\beta = 1\)). This leads to the differential operator \( (d^2 + 4d + 5) \).

3. **Auxiliary Equation for Annihilator**: Combine the operators to form the auxiliary equation:
   \[
   m^2 + 4m + 5 = 0
   \]
   Solving this gives complex conjugate roots \( m_1 = -2 + i \) and \( m_2 = -2 - i \). Additionally, include \( m_3 = m_4 = 1 \) from the repeated root in the complementary solution.

4. **Particular Solution**: Construct the particular solution \( y_p \) using terms not present in the homogeneous solution:
   \[
   y_p = a e^{-2x} \cos x + b e^{-2x} \sin x
   \]
   Here, \( a \) and \( b \) are coefficients to be determined.

The focus is on forming the particular solution based on identified terms, without further differentiation of \( y_p \).
