The text explains how to verify solutions to a system of linear differential equations using matrix multiplication. It describes representing the derivative of a vector \( X \), which includes variables such as \( X \) and \( Y \), as the product of a constant matrix \( A \) and the vector \( X \). An example demonstrates that multiplying matrix \( A \) by vector \( X \) results in correct derivatives, confirming the validity of \( A \).

The text also discusses combining solutions. If two solutions are linearly independent (not scalar multiples of each other), any constant combination of these solutions is a valid solution to the homogeneous system. The Wronskian, a determinant-based test for linear independence, verifies this: if it is non-zero, the solutions are confirmed as linearly independent.

In summary, verifying matrix multiplication confirms specific solutions to differential equations, and linear combinations of independent solutions provide additional valid solutions, validated through the Wronskian.
