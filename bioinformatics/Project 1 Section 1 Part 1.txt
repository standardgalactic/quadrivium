and here we have our first Julia project a proper project and it's going to be on medical statistics
really a good nice little project about introductory medical research we're going to
set up a medical research project from start to finish a real basic project and then eventually
we'll analyze the data in Julia using juliabox.org and as always you'll have the files available
on github if you do not want to to create them all yourself so what are we going to be up to we're
going to discuss all the basic steps in conducting medical research we're going to come up with a
research question once we have that question we're going to do a literature search we're going to see
what has been published about our research question we've got to then decide what type of study we want
to do and then what variables would be required for this type of study so that we can answer our
research question we'll use those variables and we'll set our null and alternate hypotheses
we'll talk a little bit about doing a protocol and getting ethics approval for our study
we're going to develop a data collection tool ensuring patient anonymity we do not want our
patient details to become publicly publicly available then we're going to import our data set into Julia
and we're going to do our data analysis so first up in the next section we'll start off with the research
