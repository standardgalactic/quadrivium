The text discusses the differentiation of a vector function in terms of time to find the instantaneous velocity and speed. Here are the main ideas:

1. **Instantaneous Velocity Vector**: For a given vector function representing position over time, the instantaneous velocity is found by taking the first derivative of each component of the vector.

2. **Speed Calculation**: The speed is determined as the norm (magnitude) of the velocity vector, which involves squaring the components, summing them up, and taking the square root. In this example, trigonometric identities simplify the expression to a constant value, indicating that speed is independent of time.

3. **Path Description in 2D**: The position function describes a circular path with a radius of 2 in a Cartesian coordinate system. This conclusion comes from expressing \(x^2 + y^2\) as a trigonometric identity equaling a constant.

4. **Velocity Vector at Specific Times**: The text provides examples of velocity vectors at specific times (e.g., \(t = 0\) and \(t = \pi/2\)), illustrating how the direction changes while maintaining constant speed, consistent with uniform circular motion.

5. **Uniform Circular Motion**: It highlights that although the speed is constant, the changing direction of the velocity vector confirms that the particle moves in a circle at a constant speed, with the velocity vector always tangent to the path.

This explanation emphasizes understanding how differentiation applies to vector functions and the geometric interpretation of such motions in physics and calculus.

The text discusses vector function differentiation, specifically using an example involving trigonometric functions. The main ideas are:

1. **Differentiability and Smoothness**: A vector function is differentiable if its derivative exists and is continuous. However, being differentiable does not imply the function is smooth.

2. **Smooth Curve Criteria**:
   - The derivative of the position vector \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) must exist and be continuous.
   - \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) should not equal zero to ensure smoothness, as zero indicates a cusp or point where the curve is not smooth.

3. **Example Analysis**: The example involves differentiating a position vector function with trigonometric components. It shows that while the derivative exists and is continuous over the domain \( [0, 2\pi] \), the presence of points where the derivative equals zero (e.g., at \( t = 0 \) and \( t = \pi \)) means the curve is not smooth.

4. **Piecewise Smoothness**: Although the entire curve is not smooth due to cusps, it can be considered piecewise smooth. This involves breaking the interval into segments where the function is smooth (e.g., from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{\pi}{2} \)) and considering each segment separately.

In summary, differentiability does not guarantee a smooth curve unless additional conditions are met, such as the derivative never being zero. The example illustrates these concepts using trigonometric functions and highlights the distinction between overall and piecewise smoothness.

The text discusses conditions for vector function differentiation to define smooth curves. A smooth curve requires that its position vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), defined over a closed interval, satisfies two criteria: 

1. The first derivative of each component must exist.
2. This derivative should not be the zero vector on any open subinterval within the domain.

An example given is the position vector \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t^2, 2at)\), where \(a\) is a nonzero constant and \(t\) spans all real numbers. For this function:

- The derivative exists as \((2t, 2a)\).
- Since \(a \neq 0\), the derivative never equals the zero vector for any \(t\) in its domain.

Thus, \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) meets the criteria for being a smooth curve over its entire domain.

The text discusses the differentiation of vector functions, focusing on determining their smoothness. It presents two examples: a parametrization of a parabola and a helix.

1. **Parabola**: The function is represented by \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \), which never equals the zero vector because it consistently has non-zero values across all \( t \). This ensures that both criteria for smoothness are met: the derivative exists everywhere, and it never becomes zero.

2. **Helix**: Defined with components involving cosine and sine of \( t \), along with a linear term in \( t \) for the z-axis. The resulting shape is a spiral that ascends as \( t \) increases. Its first derivative, which includes negative sine, cosine, and 1, exists for all real numbers. Since this derivative also never equals zero due to the constant 1 component, it satisfies both criteria for smoothness.

Both the parabola and helix are concluded to be smooth vector functions because their derivatives exist everywhere and do not become zero at any point.
