The text provides an overview of two main types of telescopes: reflecting and refracting. Reflecting telescopes use a concave mirror instead of lenses to gather light, avoiding issues like chromatic aberration found in refracting telescopes that use glass lenses. These problems arise because different wavelengths of light bend differently through the lens materials, leading to color fringing.

The discussion includes details on calculating angular magnification for telescopes using formulas involving focal lengths and radii of curvature (for mirrors). A specific example shows how you can calculate the magnification by substituting values into these equations.

Additionally, a compound system problem is described involving a converging lens and a plain mirror. The setup involves an object placed at a certain distance from a lens, with a plane mirror positioned further away. Various images are formed through this system:

1. An inverted real image is initially formed by the lens.
2. This real image acts as a virtual object for the lens due to its position relative to the mirror, forming another image.
3. The interaction between the lens and mirror produces multiple images—both real and virtual—through iterative reflections.

The text emphasizes understanding these concepts without being misled by the apparent complexity of the setup.
