The text provides an overview of two main types of telescopes: reflecting and refracting. Reflecting telescopes use a concave mirror instead of lenses to gather light, avoiding issues like chromatic aberration found in refracting telescopes that use glass lenses. These problems arise because different wavelengths of light bend differently through the lens materials, leading to color fringing.

The discussion includes details on calculating angular magnification for telescopes using formulas involving focal lengths and radii of curvature (for mirrors). A specific example shows how you can calculate the magnification by substituting values into these equations.

Additionally, a compound system problem is described involving a converging lens and a plain mirror. The setup involves an object placed at a certain distance from a lens, with a plane mirror positioned further away. Various images are formed through this system:

1. An inverted real image is initially formed by the lens.
2. This real image acts as a virtual object for the lens due to its position relative to the mirror, forming another image.
3. The interaction between the lens and mirror produces multiple images—both real and virtual—through iterative reflections.

The text emphasizes understanding these concepts without being misled by the apparent complexity of the setup.

The text discusses two types of telescopes: reflecting and refracting. In a reflecting telescope, the objective lens is replaced by a concave mirror, while both types can involve compound lens systems that are not thin lenses to avoid spherical aberration. Refracting telescopes need non-spherical surfaces to prevent chromatic aberration due to different refractive indices for various light wavelengths.

The angular magnification of a telescope can be calculated using the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece lenses, even if a problem involves a concave mirror (reflecting lens) where \( f = -\frac{r}{2} \).

A complex problem involves a converging lens with an 8 cm focal distance, an object placed 40 cm from the lens, and a plane mirror 30 cm behind it. This setup results in multiple images:

1. The lens forms an inverted real image at 10 cm.
2. The virtual image appears at 20 cm on the same side due to reflection by the plane mirror.
3. The lens then treats this virtual image as a real object located effectively at -50 cm (mirrored position), forming another real, inverted image at approximately 9.5 cm on the opposite side of the original object location.

This system results in multiple images: one initial real and inverted image, followed by a series of virtual and real images due to reflections between the lens and mirror.
