The text provides an explanation of interference phenomena with a focus on Young's double-slit experiment and how coherent light sources lead to constructive or destructive interference patterns. Here is a summary:

1. **Interference Basics**: Interference occurs when two waves overlap. If they are in phase, they constructively interfere; if out of phase by half a wavelength, they destructively interfere.

2. **Coherent Light**: Coherence means that the light sources emit waves with constant phase differences and wavelengths. For interference to be observed consistently, the sources must not change their relative positions or frequencies over time.

3. **Path Difference in Interference**:
   - Constructive interference happens when the path difference \( L2 - L1 \) is an integer multiple of the wavelength (\( n\lambda \)), where \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \).
   - Destructive interference occurs when the path difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength (\( (n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda \)).

4. **Young's Double-Slit Experiment**: This experiment involves two coherent light sources that create an interference pattern on a screen. The pattern consists of bright and dark fringes corresponding to areas of constructive and destructive interference, respectively.

5. **Example Calculations**:
   - For a wavelength of 0.1 meters, if the distances from the point of observation to the two sources are 3.2 meters and 3.0 meters, the path difference is 0.2 meters (2 times the wavelength), resulting in constructive interference.
   - If one distance were 3.05 meters instead, making the path difference 0.15 meters (\(1.5 \times\) the wavelength), destructive interference would occur.

6. **Square Arrangement**: When coherent sources are placed at opposite corners of a square and an observer is positioned at the center, constructive interference occurs because all distances from the source to the center are equal, making \( L2 - L1 = 0 \).

This explanation clarifies how path differences between waves lead to different types of interference patterns based on coherence and wavelength.
