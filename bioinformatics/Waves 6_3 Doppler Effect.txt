Now I just wonder, a quick problem of two objects moving towards each other, I'm not going to give an example, but that's the observer, and that is the source, this is our unit vector direction, and I say that the observer is moving in this direction, and the source is moving in this direction, so they're both moving, nothing under all is happening, and it's still going to be the frequency of the source, velocity, the observer is in the same direction,
so it's going to be busted V0, and B, this is in the opposite direction, so mine is Vsauce, which is going to give you an even greater effect, and as much as you're increasing the numerator and you're decreasing the denominator, so it'll be even more obviously as opposed to just one of them being zero, and if you get a problem, say for instance where the two submarines coming towards each other,
and you remember, if they want, then the frequency that the original source was going to hear the member, you've got to swap them around, this is like we did in the previous problems, so the observer becomes the source, and the source becomes the observer, and you just have to do it the second way around.
Now, another problem that I want to do the problem is to explain the concept, once again, if we do have a source and an observer, it's our unit electional vector, if they move towards each other, we're going to be left with frequency of the observer equals frequency of the source, and we have the velocity plus the velocity of the observer, and the velocity minus the velocity of the source.
And if we're given the velocity of a wave, and we just now want to know what the wavelength is of this wave, it's got nothing to do with these relative velocities, it's just going to do with velocity, the speed of the wave through our medium, so that it's simply just going to be V divided by this frequency that the observer has.
that the frequency that the observer hears, that it's going to be for him the wavelength.
