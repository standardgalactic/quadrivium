The text outlines a method for solving an initial value problem using Laplace transforms applied to the differential equation \( y' = 3y + 13 \sin(2t) \), with the initial condition \( y(0) = 6 \). Here's a concise summary of the process:

1. **Laplace Transform Application**:
   - The left-hand side, involving the derivative, transforms to \( sY(s) - 6 + 3Y(s) \).
   - The right-hand side becomes \( 13 \cdot \frac{2}{s^2 + 4} = \frac{26}{s^2 + 4} \).

2. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - Substitute the initial condition into the transformed equation, resulting in:
     \[
     (s + 3)Y(s) - 6 = \frac{26}{s^2 + 4}
     \]
   - Solve for \( Y(s) \):
     \[
     Y(s) = \frac{26}{(s^2 + 4)(s + 3)} + \frac{6}{s + 3}
     \]

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**:
   - Express \( Y(s) \) using partial fractions:
     \[
     Y(s) = \frac{8}{s + 3} - \frac{2s}{s^2 + 4}
     \]

4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:
   - Use the inverse Laplace transform on each term:
     - \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{8}{s + 3}\right\} = 8e^{-3t} \)
     - \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{-\frac{2s}{s^2 + 4}\right\} = -2\cos(2t) \)

5. **Final Solution**:
   - Combine the inverse transforms to find the solution in the time domain:
     \[
     y(t) = 8e^{-3t} - 2\cos(2t)
     \]

The text emphasizes how Laplace transforms simplify solving differential equations by converting them into algebraic problems, ultimately providing a clear and manageable path to finding solutions.
