The text analyzes a physics problem involving two carts before and after a collision to determine the speed of their combined center of mass post-collision. 

**Part B Recap**:  
- The final velocity of the second cart after the impact is approximately 1.9 meters per second, based on previous calculations.

**Part C Analysis**:  
- Focuses on finding the center of mass speed for both carts.
- Since there is zero acceleration post-collision, linear motion equations with constant velocities are used.
- Initial positions at collision time are set to zero.

For Cart 1:
- Velocity after collision: 0.66 meters per second
- Position equation: \( x_1 = 0.66t \)

For Cart 2:
- Velocity post-collision (from Part B): 1.9 meters per second
- Position equation: \( x_2 = 1.9t \)

To determine the center of mass velocity, use the formula:
\[ 
x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{(m_1 \times x_1) + (m_2 \times x_2)}{m_1 + m_2} 
\]

Substitute known values for masses and positions. Mass \( m_1 \) is given, while mass \( m_2 \) was calculated earlier.

The velocity of the center of mass (\( v_{\text{cm}} \)) is found by differentiating the position of the center of mass with respect to time:
\[ 
v_{\text{cm}} = \frac{d(x_{\text{cm}})}{dt} \approx 0.93 \, \text{meters per second}
\]

This method employs calculus and linear motion principles to simplify finding the center of mass velocity.
