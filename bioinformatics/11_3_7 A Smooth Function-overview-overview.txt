The text explores key ideas in multivariable calculus regarding the differentiability and continuity of functions:

1. **Differentiability Implies Continuity**: In multivariable calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point, it is also continuous there. However, continuity alone does not guarantee differentiability.

2. **Non-Differentiable Points**: Functions can be continuous yet non-differentiable at certain points, such as sharp corners or cusps, where the derivative does not exist.

3. **Conditions for Differentiability in Multivariable Functions**:
   - The gradient of the function must exist.
   - The existence and continuity of the gradient can help determine differentiability by evaluating limits related to tangent planes.
   - A simpler rule is that if the gradient exists and is continuous at a point, the function is differentiable there.

4. **Smooth Functions**: These are \( C^1 \) functions with all partial derivatives defined and continuous across their domain, ensuring differentiability throughout that domain.

Overall, these concepts help distinguish between functions that transition smoothly and those with more complex behaviors at certain points.
