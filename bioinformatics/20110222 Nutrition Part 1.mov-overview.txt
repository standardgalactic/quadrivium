This text provides an overview of nutritional support for surgical patients, emphasizing its importance due to the complications associated with malnutrition. Malnourished surgical patients experience increased morbidity, longer hospital stays, slower recovery, higher mortality rates, more frequent readmissions, and greater healthcare costs.

The definition by the World Health Organization highlights that malnutrition is a cellular imbalance of nutrient supply versus demand, affecting not only underweight individuals but also those who are overweight or obese. Nutrients are categorized into macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements), with deficiencies leading to various forms of malnutrition.

Goals for surgical nutrition have evolved from merely maintaining lean body mass to addressing acute or chronic malnutrition's hypermetabolic effects. Proper nutritional support aims to stabilize lean body mass, prevent inflammatory responses, modulate immune function, and ensure glycemic control.

Identifying malnourished patients involves clinical assessments like weight loss history and physical examinations for signs such as temporal wasting, skin changes, and muscle wasting. Technical methods include measurements of body mass index (BMI), mid-arm muscle circumference, triceps skin folds, hand grip strength, and biochemical markers like albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin.

Certain patients are more susceptible to malnutrition due to their conditions, such as those with pancreatitis, burns, intracutaneous fistula, bowel failure, liver disease, chronic alcoholism, critical illnesses, polytrauma, or head injuries. These individuals have significantly increased energy requirements that need to be met through appropriate nutritional support.

The text also mentions various scoring systems like the prognostic nutritional index and subjective global assessment, which incorporate different health parameters for evaluating malnutrition risk. Ultimately, healthcare providers are encouraged to use clinical judgment alongside these tools to identify and address malnutrition in surgical patients effectively.

The presentation discusses nutritional support for surgical patients, emphasizing its importance due to the complications associated with malnutrition. Malnourished surgical patients face increased morbidity, longer hospital stays, slower recovery, higher mortality rates, frequent readmissions, and greater healthcare costs.

Malnutrition is defined by the World Health Organization as an imbalance between nutrient supply and demand for growth, maintenance, and function. It can affect not only thin individuals but also overweight and obese people if their diet lacks essential nutrients despite high caloric intake.

Nutrients are categorized into macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements). Deficiencies in these can lead to malnutrition disorders. Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), classically known as marasmus or kwashiorkor, involves either severe thinness or edema.

The goals of surgical nutrition include preventing weight loss, reducing inflammatory responses, modulating immune function, and ensuring glycemic control by providing appropriate nutrients. Identifying malnourished patients involves clinical assessments such as significant unintentional weight loss, temporal wasting, skin changes, and disease-related nutritional intake issues. Other methods include measuring body mass index (BMI), mid-arm muscle circumference, triceps skin folds, hand grip dynamometry, and biochemical markers like albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin.

Certain conditions necessitate nutritional supplementation due to increased metabolic demands or impaired nutrient absorption, including severe pancreatitis, burns, bowel failure, liver disease, chronic alcoholism, and critical illnesses such as polytrauma and head injuries. Effective identification of malnourished patients often involves a combination of clinical judgment and specific assessments, recognizing that malnutrition can occur in individuals without HIV.
