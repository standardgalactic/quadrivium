MOOCs, Massive Open Online Courses, are they going to replace traditional education?
Well, I think the problem there lies with how we set up a debate.
We have a base assumption, we have logical arguments,
and you can argue very correctly for a MOOC and against a MOOC,
and we can come to a conclusion.
The problem is that the probability of our conclusion being correct
if there's something wrong with our base assumption is actually very low,
and there is a problem with the base assumption.
It would assume that one or the other, but not both, can occur, and that's just wrong.
Now, think back to being a student, think of students.
We all learnt in a different way.
We all needed to engage with knowledge in a different way to make that knowledge our own.
Now, if you have one lecturer who perhaps decided what the student should know
and he or she decided how to teach those students, you're going to miss out some students.
Some of those students are not going to be able to meet up with the correct knowledge,
and that's just so wrong.
If you have more voices, more voices in the ears of those students,
you are going to capture more students.
You're going to have a lot more success, and that's where Open Educational Resources,
and that is where MOOCs come in.
We are just enriching the field of bringing knowledge to students in such a way
that we cannot ignore it any longer.
any longer.
