The text outlines how acute appendicitis can present with varying symptoms based on the anatomy and position of the appendix. The classic symptoms include peri-umbilical discomfort migrating to the right iliac fossa, anorexia, nausea, constipation, and low-grade fever, often leading directly to surgical intervention due to tenderness at McBurney's point.

The variability in symptoms is attributed to the appendix's position and its innervation. The appendix is a true diverticulum of the colon with a variable location that influences symptom presentation. Initially, inflammation causes visceral pain around the umbilicus due to midgut embryology; as it progresses to involve the parietal peritoneum, localized pain becomes more pronounced.

Different anatomical positions of the appendix, such as retrocecal or retrocolic, can alter symptoms. For example, if the appendix extends into the pelvis, it may irritate the rectum and cause diarrhea instead of typical symptoms. Therefore, the presentation of appendicitis depends on the specific location of the appendix and its local effects.
