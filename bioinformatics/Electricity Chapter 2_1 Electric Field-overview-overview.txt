This introduction to electric fields explains how charged particles influence each other through forces exerted by electric fields, which are vector fields measured in Newtons per Coulomb (SI units). The concept is demonstrated using a positive test charge near another charged object, with the force measured via Coulomb's law to define the field.

Key points include:
- Electric fields emanate from positive charges and converge on negative ones.
- Fields can be represented by vectors or visualized with electric field lines, which show direction and strengthâ€”more lines indicate a stronger field.
- For uniformly infinite plates, the field between them is depicted as straight lines.
- Future content will cover the electric field due to a point charge.

This explanation provides a foundational understanding of how electric fields behave and can be visualized.
