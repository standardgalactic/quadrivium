The text describes solving an initial value problem involving a differential equation that is not easily separable or directly linear. The focus shifts toward identifying it as an exact equation, which requires the expression to be in the form \( M(x, y) \, dx + N(x, y) \, dy = 0 \).

The original differential equation given is:
\[ (xy^2 - \cos x \sin x) \, dx = (y(1 - x^2)) \, dy. \]

To solve this as an exact equation, it's rearranged to:
\[ xy^2 - \cos x \sin x \, dx + (-y(x^2 - 1)) \, dy = 0. \]

The functions \( M(x, y) = xy^2 - \cos x \sin x \) and \( N(x, y) = -y(x^2 - 1) \) are identified. The condition for exactness is checked by ensuring that the partial derivatives satisfy:
\[ \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}. \]

Both derivatives turn out to be \( 2xy \), confirming the equation is exact.

The next step involves finding a potential function \( f(x, y) \) such that:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = M(x, y) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = N(x, y). \]

Integrating \( M \) with respect to \( x \), the function \( f(x, y) \) is found:
\[ f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + h(x). \]

Differentiating this with respect to \( y \) and setting it equal to \( N(x, y) \), the function \( h(x) \) is determined:
\[ h'(x) = \cos x - \sin x. \]

Integrating \( h'(x) \) gives:
\[ h(x) = \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x + C. \]

Thus, the potential function becomes:
\[ f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x + C. \]

Using the initial condition \( x = 0, y = 2 \), the constant \( C \) is calculated:
\[ f(0, 2) = -2 + \frac{1}{2}(1) + C = -\frac{3}{2}. \]
Thus, \( C = 0 \).

The solution to the differential equation is:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x = -\frac{3}{2}. \]

Multiplying through by \(-2\) gives:
\[ y^2 - x^2y^2 - \cos^2 x = 3. \]

Factoring out \( y^2 \) results in:
\[ y^2(1 - x^2) - \cos^2 x = 3. \]

The text appears to describe an algebraic or trigonometric equation: \( 1 - x^2 - \cos^2(x) + 3x = 0 \). It mentions that it is possible to manipulate or rearrange the equation to solve for a variable, likely aiming to express one variable explicitly in terms of others. The specific steps for solving such an equation would involve algebraic manipulation and potentially using trigonometric identities, but these are not detailed in the text. Essentially, the focus is on expressing the equation in a form where \( y \) (presumably representing part or all of the expression) is isolated as a function of other variables.
