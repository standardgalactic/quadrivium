The text describes solving an initial value problem involving a differential equation that is not easily separable or directly linear. The focus shifts toward identifying it as an exact equation, which requires the expression to be in the form \( M(x, y) \, dx + N(x, y) \, dy = 0 \).

The original differential equation given is:
\[ (xy^2 - \cos x \sin x) \, dx = (y(1 - x^2)) \, dy. \]

To solve this as an exact equation, it's rearranged to:
\[ xy^2 - \cos x \sin x \, dx + (-y(x^2 - 1)) \, dy = 0. \]

The functions \( M(x, y) = xy^2 - \cos x \sin x \) and \( N(x, y) = -y(x^2 - 1) \) are identified. The condition for exactness is checked by ensuring that the partial derivatives satisfy:
\[ \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}. \]

Both derivatives turn out to be \( 2xy \), confirming the equation is exact.

The next step involves finding a potential function \( f(x, y) \) such that:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = M(x, y) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = N(x, y). \]

Integrating \( M \) with respect to \( x \), the function \( f(x, y) \) is found:
\[ f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + h(x). \]

Differentiating this with respect to \( y \) and setting it equal to \( N(x, y) \), the function \( h(x) \) is determined:
\[ h'(x) = \cos x - \sin x. \]

Integrating \( h'(x) \) gives:
\[ h(x) = \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x + C. \]

Thus, the potential function becomes:
\[ f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x + C. \]

Using the initial condition \( x = 0, y = 2 \), the constant \( C \) is calculated:
\[ f(0, 2) = -2 + \frac{1}{2}(1) + C = -\frac{3}{2}. \]
Thus, \( C = 0 \).

The solution to the differential equation is:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos^2 x = -\frac{3}{2}. \]

Multiplying through by \(-2\) gives:
\[ y^2 - x^2y^2 - \cos^2 x = 3. \]

Factoring out \( y^2 \) results in:
\[ y^2(1 - x^2) - \cos^2 x = 3. \]

The text appears to describe an algebraic or trigonometric equation: \( 1 - x^2 - \cos^2(x) + 3x = 0 \). It mentions that it is possible to manipulate or rearrange the equation to solve for a variable, likely aiming to express one variable explicitly in terms of others. The specific steps for solving such an equation would involve algebraic manipulation and potentially using trigonometric identities, but these are not detailed in the text. Essentially, the focus is on expressing the equation in a form where \( y \) (presumably representing part or all of the expression) is isolated as a function of other variables.

The text describes the process of solving an initial value problem involving differential equations. It begins by determining whether the equation is separable or linear, finding both methods unsuitable. The focus then shifts to treating it as an exact equation.

1. **Equation Setup:** The given equation is \( xy^2 - \cos(x) \sin(x) \, dx = y(1-x^2) \, dy \). It's rearranged by moving terms around and ensuring the correct signs, resulting in \( (xy^2 - \cos(x) \sin(x)) \, dx + (x^2y - y) \, dy = 0 \).

2. **Checking Exactness:** The function is confirmed to be exact because partial derivatives are equal: 
   - \( M_y = 2xy \)
   - \( N_x = 2xy \)

3. **Finding the Potential Function \( f(x, y) \):** 
   - Integrate \( M \) with respect to \( y \) to get \( f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + h(x) \).
   - Differentiate this result with respect to \( x \), equate it to \( N \), and solve for \( h'(x) \). This gives \( h(x) = \frac{1}{2}\cos^2(x) + C \).

4. **General Solution:** Combine terms to form the potential function: 
   \[
   f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos^2(x) + C
   \]

5. **Applying Initial Conditions:** Use the initial conditions \( x = 0 \), \( y = 2 \) to solve for \( C \):
   \[
   f(0, 2) = -2 + \frac{1}{2} = C \Rightarrow C = -\frac{3}{2}
   \]

6. **Final Solution:** Substitute back into the general solution:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos^2(x) = -\frac{3}{2}
   \]

7. **Simplified Form:** Multiply through by \(-2\) to clear fractions:
   \[
   y^2 - x^2y^2 - \cos^2(x) = 3
   \]
   Factor out \( y^2 \):
   \[
   y^2(1-x^2) - \cos^2(x) = 3
   \]

This process outlines solving the differential equation by confirming its exactness, integrating to find a potential function, and applying initial conditions to determine specific constants.

The given text describes a mathematical expression and suggests solving it. The original expression is:

\[ 1 - x^2 - \cos^2(x) + 3x = 0 \]

It mentions the possibility of rearranging or manipulating this equation to solve for \( y \), implying that the equation could be rewritten in an explicit form where \( y \) is expressed as a function of other variables, potentially including \( x \). However, without additional context or information about how \( y \) relates to the expression, further specific details on solving it explicitly cannot be provided. The focus seems to be on transforming this equation into a form that isolates \( y \).
