The text explains the fundamental theorem of calculus, which establishes that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. This understanding is crucial for applying these mathematical operations effectively, beyond just memorizing techniques.

Using a physics analogy involving distance (\(s\)) and velocity (\(v\)), the text illustrates how differentiation converts a function describing distance over time into one representing instantaneous velocity. Conversely, integration determines the total distance traveled by calculating the area under a velocity-time curve between two points.

The fundamental theorem of calculus is summarized as stating that the definite integral of a function over an interval equals the difference in its antiderivative evaluated at the interval's endpoints. This concept is demonstrated with simple examples, such as \(s = 2t\), to show how integrating velocity over time yields the distance traveled, represented by the area under the curve between two points.

The text also clarifies notation: \(\int f(x) \, dx\) denotes the integral of \(f\) with respect to \(x\), similar to summing the areas of small rectangles under a curve (\(v \cdot dt\) for velocity-time graphs).

Ultimately, comprehending this theorem helps explain why evaluating an antiderivative at the bounds and subtracting gives the change in the original function over that interval. This understanding aids in grasping how integration and differentiation are interconnected processes.
