Hypovolemic shock results from significant fluid loss, primarily due to hemorrhage (blood loss) and plasma depletion caused by fluid sequestration in tissues or gastrointestinal/urinary losses. Plasma loss can be challenging to identify and often follows infection, inflammation, pancreatitis, trauma, or surgery, leading to increased capillary permeability.

The body compensates for hypovolemia through sympathetic activation, stress hormone release, interstitial fluid resorption, intracellular fluid mobilization, and renal conservation efforts to maintain cerebral and coronary blood flow. 

Hemorrhage-related shock is categorized into classes based on the percentage of total blood volume lost:
- **Class 1**: 10-15% loss (500-750 mL in a 70 kg person), usually well-tolerated with mild tachycardia.
- **Class 2**: 15-30% loss (750 mL to 1.5 L), causing anxiety, pronounced tachycardia, reduced pulse pressure, cold extremities, and mild oliguria due to hormonal responses.
- **Class 3**: 30-40% loss (1.5-2 L), marked by severe tachycardia, tachypnea, depression, hypotension, and mental status changes.
- **Class 4**: Over 40% loss (>2 L), resulting in severe hypotension, confusion, agitation, obtundation, and potential unconsciousness due to inadequate cerebral perfusion.

If not recognized and managed promptly, decompensation can occur, leading to cellular damage, inflammation, and possible multi-organ dysfunction. Internal bleeding and plasma losses are more difficult to diagnose than external hemorrhage. Key points include:
- Do not rely solely on supine vital signs; dizziness and heart rate changes may occur when upright.
- Capillary refill time is not a reliable indicator.
- Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels remain stable initially due to compensatory mechanisms.
- Plasma loss can lead to hemoconcentration, complicating diagnosis. 

Early recognition and management of early-stage shock are crucial to prevent progression to more severe states.

Hypovolemic shock is caused by significant fluid loss, primarily from hemorrhage (blood loss) and plasma depletion due to factors like extravascular fluid sequestration, gastrointestinal, or urinary losses. Fluid sequestration can follow infections, inflammations, trauma, or surgery, increasing capillary permeability and causing intravascular fluid to move into the interstitium.

To compensate for hypovolemia, physiological changes occur to protect cerebral and coronary blood flow, driven by sympathetic activity, stress hormones release, resorption of interstitial fluid, mobilization of intracellular fluid, and renal conservation. Hemorrhage is easier to quantify than plasma losses, with classifications based on the percentage of total blood volume lost:

- **Class 1 Hemorrhage**: Loss of 10-15% (500-750 ml), generally well tolerated, may present as mild tachycardia.
- **Class 2 Hemorrhage**: Loss of 15-30% (750-1500 ml), symptoms include anxiety, tachycardia, reduced pulse pressure, cold and pale extremities, and mild oliguria due to hormone-mediated renal constriction. This is a compensated form of shock.
- **Class 3 Hemorrhage**: Loss of 30-40% (1500-2000 ml), with pronounced symptoms like tachycardia, tachypnea, mental depression, and hypotension.
- **Class 4 Hemorrhage**: Loss over 40% (>2000 ml), resulting in severe hypotension, agitation, obtundation, and eventually loss of consciousness due to inadequate cerebral perfusion.

If unrecognized or untreated, decompensation leads to cellular damage and potential multi-organ dysfunction. Internal bleeding and plasma losses can be challenging to diagnose, as vital signs in the supine position might not reveal early compensated hemorrhage symptoms like dizziness upon standing. Capillary refill time is unreliable; hematocrit and hemoglobin levels may remain stable initially due to fluid shifts or crystalloid administration, which can lead to hemoconcentration.
