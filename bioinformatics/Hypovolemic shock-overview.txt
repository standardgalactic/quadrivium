Hypovolemic shock results from significant fluid loss, primarily due to hemorrhage (blood loss) and plasma depletion caused by fluid sequestration in tissues or gastrointestinal/urinary losses. Plasma loss can be challenging to identify and often follows infection, inflammation, pancreatitis, trauma, or surgery, leading to increased capillary permeability.

The body compensates for hypovolemia through sympathetic activation, stress hormone release, interstitial fluid resorption, intracellular fluid mobilization, and renal conservation efforts to maintain cerebral and coronary blood flow. 

Hemorrhage-related shock is categorized into classes based on the percentage of total blood volume lost:
- **Class 1**: 10-15% loss (500-750 mL in a 70 kg person), usually well-tolerated with mild tachycardia.
- **Class 2**: 15-30% loss (750 mL to 1.5 L), causing anxiety, pronounced tachycardia, reduced pulse pressure, cold extremities, and mild oliguria due to hormonal responses.
- **Class 3**: 30-40% loss (1.5-2 L), marked by severe tachycardia, tachypnea, depression, hypotension, and mental status changes.
- **Class 4**: Over 40% loss (>2 L), resulting in severe hypotension, confusion, agitation, obtundation, and potential unconsciousness due to inadequate cerebral perfusion.

If not recognized and managed promptly, decompensation can occur, leading to cellular damage, inflammation, and possible multi-organ dysfunction. Internal bleeding and plasma losses are more difficult to diagnose than external hemorrhage. Key points include:
- Do not rely solely on supine vital signs; dizziness and heart rate changes may occur when upright.
- Capillary refill time is not a reliable indicator.
- Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels remain stable initially due to compensatory mechanisms.
- Plasma loss can lead to hemoconcentration, complicating diagnosis. 

Early recognition and management of early-stage shock are crucial to prevent progression to more severe states.
