The text discusses the concept of an isomorphism between two groups in abstract algebra, specifically using examples with colored chalk for illustration. An isomorphism is defined as a bijective homomorphism—a function that is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective), preserving group operations.

Two specific sets are considered: \( G \), the integers modulo 4 under addition, and \( H \), the integers modulo 5 excluding zero, under multiplication. The mapping between these groups is described as follows:

- In \( G \): 0 → 1, 1 → 3, 2 → 4, 3 → 2
- This mapping is verified to be both injective and surjective by checking that each element in one set corresponds uniquely and completely to an element in the other.

The Cayley tables for these groups are constructed to demonstrate this correspondence. For \( G \), addition modulo 4 is used, while for \( H \), multiplication modulo 5 is applied. The verification of isomorphism involves showing that operations performed within each group correspond correctly under the mapping (e.g., checking if \( 2 + 3 = 1 \) in \( G \) maps to \( 4 \times 2 = 3 \) in \( H \)).

An important observation made during this discussion is the property of group tables: every element appears exactly once in each row and column, a characteristic feature of groups. This property ensures that no repeats occur within these finite groups, which will be useful when proving Cayley's theorem—a significant result stating that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group.

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding this structure for deeper insights into group theory and proofs like Cayley’s theorem, highlighting how recognizing such patterns in group operations can aid in constructing group tables and verifying group properties.

The text discusses an example of an isomorphism between two groups: the integers modulo 4 under addition (denoted as \( G \)) and the integers modulo 5 excluding zero under multiplication (denoted as \( H \)). An isomorphism is defined as a bijective homomorphism, meaning it is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective), establishing a direct relationship between elements of the two sets.

The mapping provided is:
- 0 in \( G \) maps to 1 in \( H \)
- 1 in \( G \) maps to 3 in \( H \)
- 2 in \( G \) maps to 4 in \( H \)
- 3 in \( G \) maps to 2 in \( H \)

The text explains that for this mapping to be an isomorphism, both sets must have the same number of elements (four in each case), and the mapping must preserve the group operation. The example demonstrates this by checking if operations in \( G \) correspond correctly to operations in \( H \).

Additionally, the text highlights a deeper property observed in the Cayley tables of these groups: every element appears exactly once in each row and column. This property is significant because it implies that the set forms a group under the operation defined (no repeats), which is crucial for proving properties like Cayley's theorem. This observation helps ensure the structure and validity of group operations, especially in finite groups.
