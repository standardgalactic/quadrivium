Here we consider the properties of matrix arithmetic when it comes to addition and multiplication with or without scalar multiplication.
We will assume that the sizes of the matrices are such that the indicated operations can be performed.
For instance, if we say add matrix A to matrix B, we assume that they are both of the same size, such as both being 3 by 4 matrices.
You can't add matrices of different sizes to each other, and we've seen this before.
The first law is the commutative law of addition, and that states that A plus B will be the same as B plus A.
That's easy enough.
The associative law of addition states that if 3 or more matrices are added, it will not make a difference which combinations are used to do the addition.
The associative law of multiplication states the same as the associative law of addition.
An important difference though is that the order must remain the same.
The left and right distributive laws look just like the algebraic equivalence.
Just remember again to keep the order intact.
Especially in the case of the right distributive laws, it's easy to make a mistake.
Notice how the B comes before the A in this example.
Look closely at these scalar properties.
Note specifically how the order of the matrices stay the same as the scalars are distributed.
