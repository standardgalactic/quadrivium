The text explains boolean operators AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) using examples with a computer variable named A. These operators combine conditions that evaluate to true or false:

1. **Boolean Operators:**
   - AND requires all combined conditions to be true for the result to be true.
   - OR needs only one condition to be true for the result to be true.

2. **Examples with Variable A:**
   - For `A = 7`, both "is prime A?" and "is A equal to 7?" are true, so AND returns true.
   - For `A = 9`, while "is A equal to 9?" is true, "is prime A?" is false, making the AND result false.
   - Using OR with either value shows that if any condition is true, the result is true.

3. **Further Illustration:**
   - Various values of A demonstrate how AND requires all conditions to be true, while OR only needs one.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Boolean operators are essential for decision-making in programming.
   - The text introduces these concepts as a precursor to learning about loops.
