The text provides an overview of calculating the directional derivative for a multivariable function \( f(x, y, z) = z - e^x \sin(y) \), specifically at point \( P = (\ln(3), \frac{3\pi}{2}, -3) \). The process involves several key steps:

1. **Gradient Calculation**: 
   - Compute the partial derivatives: 
     - With respect to \( x \): \(-e^x \sin(y)\)
     - With respect to \( y \): \(-e^x \cos(y)\)
     - With respect to \( z \): 1
   - Evaluate these at point \( P \), resulting in the gradient vector: 
     \[
     \nabla f(P) = (3, 0, 1)
     \]

2. **Directional Derivative**:
   - Given a direction vector \( \mathbf{v} = (1, 2, 2) \), convert it to a unit vector: 
     \[
     \mathbf{\hat{v}} = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]
   - Calculate the dot product of \( \nabla f(P) \) and \( \mathbf{\hat{v}} \):
     \[
     \nabla f(P) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{v}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - Simplify to obtain the directional derivative: 
     \[
     \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}
     \]

3. **Maximum and Minimum Rate of Change**:
   - The maximum rate of change is in the direction of the gradient \( (3, 0, 1) \), with a magnitude of \( \sqrt{10} \).
   - The minimum rate of change occurs in the opposite direction \( (-3, 0, -1) \), with a magnitude of \(-\sqrt{10}\).

4. **Perpendicular Directions**:
   - A zero rate of change is achieved by moving perpendicular to the gradient.
   - For gradient \( (3, 0, 1) \), find vectors \( (a, b, c) \) such that \( 3a + c = 0 \). An example vector is \( (-\frac{1}{3}, b, 1) \).

The text highlights how gradients and directional derivatives are used to determine the rate of change in various directions. It explains concepts like orthogonality (for zero rate of change), and maximizing/minimizing rates by aligning with or opposing the gradient direction. This analysis is grounded in understanding vector calculus, particularly through gradients and dot products.
