The text introduces key concepts in abstract algebra, focusing on sets and their relationships within a universal context:

1. **Universal Set**: A non-empty set that includes all elements under consideration, crucial for defining subsets.
2. **Proper Subsets**: Sets used are proper subsets of the universal set, enabling definitions like complements.
3. **Complement of a Set (A')**: All elements in the universal set not in set A; meaningful only with a defined universal set.
4. **Union of Sets (A1 ∪ A2)**: Elements belonging to either or both sets A1 and A2, represented by logical OR and visualized using Venn diagrams.
5. **Intersection of Sets (A1 ∩ A2)**: Elements common to both sets A1 and A2, depicted with logical AND in Venn diagrams.
6. **Set Subtraction (A1 - A2)**: Elements in A1 but not in A2, effectively removing the intersection from A1.

The text further explains expressing set difference \( A_1 - A_2 \) as \( A_1 \cap B' \), where \( B' \) is the complement of B. This equivalence will be proven using set theory axioms and definitions. A Venn diagram illustrates this by showing elements in \( A_1 \) but outside \( A_2 \), highlighting their intersection with \( B' \). The text promises a formal proof to establish this relationship. These foundational concepts are essential for understanding more complex algebraic structures and proofs.
