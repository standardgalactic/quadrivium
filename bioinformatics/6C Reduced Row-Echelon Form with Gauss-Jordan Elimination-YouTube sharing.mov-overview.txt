The text provides an overview of transforming a matrix into reduced row echelon form (RREF) using elementary row operations. This process begins with Gauss elimination to achieve row echelon form, followed by Gauss-Jordan elimination to reach RREF.

Key steps include ensuring that in each column with a leading 1, all other elements are zeros, working from the bottom of the matrix upwards. Specific operations mentioned involve adding or multiplying rows to eliminate non-zero entries above and below leading ones. Once the matrix is in RREF, it reveals solutions for variables in the corresponding linear equations.

The text concludes by presenting the solved system: \( x = 2 \), \( y = 3 \), and \( z = 1 \). These results indicate that the initial set of linear equations has been successfully resolved.
