The text underscores the critical role of risk stratification in managing endocrine disorders, particularly diabetes, for surgical patients. It highlights that hyperglycemia can lead to adverse outcomes such as high infection rates, poor wound healing, ischemic complications, prolonged hospital stays, undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, and increased thrombotic events, even in non-diabetic individuals.

For diabetic patients undergoing surgery, there is debate over optimal glucose control. Typically, oral diabetes medications are stopped, and insulin therapy is adjusted via a sliding scale or infusions in skilled settings. The text also suggests considering the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during critical illness, recommending hydrocortisone use according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines to enhance catecholamine response.

In hematology, preoperative anemia and coagulation status are vital considerations. Anemia management focuses on maintaining physiological reserve and oxygen-carrying capacity, with transfusions recommended when patients cannot compensate for low hematocrit levels. The TRIC trial advises transfusion for stable patients with a hematocrit below 7, while those between 7 and 10 should be assessed based on their oxygen flux maintenance ability. Patients with cardiovascular issues may need transfusions at lower hematocrit levels, whereas those above 10 generally do not.

The text also cautions about the risks of transfusions, including allergic reactions, fluid overload, and a heightened risk of post-surgical bacterial infections, as recent BMJ studies have reported.
