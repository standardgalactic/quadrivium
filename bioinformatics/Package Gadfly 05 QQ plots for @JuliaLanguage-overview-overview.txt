The text explains how to use QQ (quantile-quantile) plots to determine if data follows a specific statistical distribution, which is crucial for choosing between parametric or non-parametric tests in hypothesis testing. 

1. **Introduction to QQ Plots**: 
   - QQ plots compare the quantiles of a dataset against those of a theoretical distribution (e.g., normal distribution) to assess whether the data can be analyzed using parametric statistics.

2. **Creating QQ Plots**:
   - An example is provided where random values from a chi-square distribution (`lambda = 1`) are compared to a standard normal distribution. If the data matches the theoretical distribution, points in the plot will align on a straight line.

3. **Example with Chi-Square Distribution**:
   - Data from a chi-square distribution does not form a straight line when plotted against a normal distribution, indicating non-normality.

4. **Applying to Own Dataset**:
   - The text advises sorting and plotting real data (`variable one`) against a normal distribution using the dataset's mean and standard deviation to check for normality. Since the points do not align in a straight line, `variable one` should be analyzed with non-parametric tests.

5. **Comparison with Other Variables**:
   - For `variable two`, the data aligns on a straight line when plotted against a normal distribution, suggesting suitability for parametric tests.
   - With `variable three`, plotting reveals patterns similar to a chi-square distribution, indicating it might be analyzed using chi-square methods.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The text highlights QQ plots' role in selecting appropriate statistical methods and mentions further exploration of scatter plots in future sections.
