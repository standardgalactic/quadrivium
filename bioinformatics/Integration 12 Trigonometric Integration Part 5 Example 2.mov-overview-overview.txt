The text describes using trigonometric substitution for integration, particularly with integrals containing square roots. It outlines three main substitution cases based on the form inside the square root:

1. **For \(\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\):** Use \(x = a\sin\theta\) or \(x = a\cos\theta\).
2. **For \(\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}\):** Use \(x = a\tan\theta\), resulting in \(\sec\theta\).
3. **For \(\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}\):** Use \(x = a\sec\theta\), resulting in \(a\tan\theta\).

An example is given to illustrate the process:

- For the integral \(\int \frac{1}{x^2\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \, dx\), identify the form as \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\).
- Substitute \(x = \tan\theta\), leading to \(dx = \sec^2\theta \, d\theta\) and \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \sec\theta\).
- Transform the integral: \(\int \frac{\sec^2\theta}{\tan^2\theta \cdot \sec\theta} \, d\theta = \int \frac{\sec\theta}{\tan^2\theta} \, d\theta\).
- Simplify using trigonometric identities: \(\sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}\) and \(\tan^2\theta = \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos^2\theta}\), resulting in \(\int \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^2\theta} \, d\theta\).
- Use \(u\)-substitution with \(u = \sin\theta\), \(du = \cos\theta \, d\theta\), leading to \(-\frac{1}{u} + C = -\frac{1}{\sin\theta} + C\).

To revert back to the original variable \(x\):

- With \(x = \tan\theta\), construct a right triangle where the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1.
- The hypotenuse becomes \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\).
- Thus, \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\).

The solution to the integral in terms of \(x\) is \(-\frac{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}{x} + C\).

Additionally, the text discusses transforming an expression \(-\frac{1}{\sin(\theta) + c}\), substituting for \(\sin(\theta)\) to obtain:

\[
-\frac{\sqrt{1+x^2}}{x + c}
\]

This is part of "reversal of trigonometric substitution."

An alternative approach sets \(\tan(\theta) = x\), implying \(\theta = \arctan(x)\). Substituting gives:

\[
-\frac{1}{\sin(\arctan(x)) + c}
\]

Both methods yield equivalent expressions involving \(x\), solving the initial problem.
