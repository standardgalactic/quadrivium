Now we have to start looking at the singular point. Let's write that singular points.
And that is where we have a point where, let's write our second order linear equation.
We have y prime prime plus a sub 1 of x. Now these are not constants, these are now functions of x.
Of our independent variable x, and a sub 0 of x, y equals 0, so it's still homogeneous.
That is where the fact that if I put this in standard form, remember that's going to be a sub 1 of x,
y prime divided by, I don't have my ruler here, I'll get it now, a sub 2 of x,
plus a sub 0 of x, over a sub 2 of x, y equals 0.
Now remember we call this the p of x, with this quotient here we call the p of x,
the division of two functions, sub 0, a sub 2, oh, remember that was the q of x,
y equals 0. Let's just get the ruler and, there we go, let's take this away, not to cause confusion here.
That was it. But what if a sub 2 of x at a certain point for x was, let's call, let's give x a value,
we call it x sub 0, and we say, well, for that value, a sub 2 of x, which is a function, is 0, for instance.
That means, this p of x is a function divided by 0 at that point, so at that point, there is a point,
at which this p of x is not analytical.
Now there's q of x for, for, for that matter.
What if the function a 2 of x was the natural log of x, and we know that has to be all values of x larger than 0.
So there's certainly going to be values for x at which this function, or these functions, are non-analytical.
Remember, those are called singular points.
But we have to look at methods where we can get solutions to these, at these singular points.
It turns out, that not all singular points are equal.
You get regular singular points,
and irregular singular points.
Irregular singular points.
So the first thing we're going to look at is, how do we identify these?
How do we identify these regular?
Let's use orange for, orange for definitions, regular and irregular.
We've got to know the definition of those.
So, the way that we do that, is first we want to identify these regular ones,
because there's something we can do to this equation,
to get beyond this singular point issue,
and we can still construct, at that singular point,
the regular singular point, we can construct a solution.
And what we're going to do, we're going to construct two equations,
p of x and q of x.
And this p of x is going to be nothing other than x minus x0,
where x0 is the singular point times the p of x.
And q of x is going to be x minus x sub 0 squared,
of the q of x.
And if both of these are analytical,
then we say that x sub 0 is a regular singular point.
If one of them, or both of them, are not analytical,
under these circumstances,
we say that this x sub 0 is an irregular singular point.
So, let's do that in an example.
Let me just grab an example here.
Let's see if I can find a nice one.
Let's do this.
We have x squared minus 4.
Shall we do that?
Let's square it.
Y prime prime.
We have plus 3x.
Let's make that minus 6.
Y prime.
And this one we can just have plus 5y equals 0.
Clearly,
I have a problem
if x squared minus 4 equals 0.
I clearly cannot have the fact that
x squared minus 4 equals 0.
Therefore,
x squared equals 4.
Therefore,
x equals plus or minus 2.
Both of those two points.
Remember,
this is now x sub 0,
giving it that point.
Plus or minus 2
is going to be this singular point.
Because if I divide throughout by this,
and let's do that,
y prime prime plus,
well, look at this.
I can take 3 out.
That leaves me x minus 2.
y prime divided by,
let's just expand this.
This is going to be x minus 2
and x plus 2,
but it's squared.
So, each of them is squared.
Let's just write it out.
x minus 2,
x plus 2,
and then lastly,
we're going to have plus 5,
y divided by all of these.
Again,
x minus 2 squared
and then x plus 2 squared.
Okay,
so they're all going to be there.
Clearly,
we said that there's singular points
at plus or minus 2.
So,
if I add 2 there,
I'm going to have 2 minus 2,
which is 0.
I can't divide by 0.
If I have negative 2,
I have negative 2 plus 2 there.
That's division by 0.
These are all products.
So, clearly,
that is a singular point.
Remember, though,
this is my p of x.
Now, let's do that.
The p of x is going to get rid
of something for me.
There's a 1 of the x minus 2s.
1 of the x minus 2s
are now gone.
So, let's use our first regular point.
x sub 0 equals positive 2.
Let's use that one.
We're going to construct the p of x,
as I said.
It is going to be
x minus x sub 0.
There is 2.
Times
the p of x.
Well,
there's the p of x.
It is 3.
Divided by an x plus 2.
An x minus 2.
Another x plus 2.
And we do that.
Now, we're going to have
another cancellation.
That one is going to cancel,
and that one is going to cancel.
What do we have now?
We only have x plus 2 squared
in the denominator.
If I plug 2 in there,
2 plus 2 is 4.
2 plus 2 is 4.
This is analytical
at x sub 0.
Let's construct the q of x.
Remember,
I said
that it's going to be
x minus
x sub 0,
which is 2 in this instance,
but this time we're going to square it.
It's going to be squared
times the q of x,
which is all of this.
5y.
Not the y.
That's not,
q of x is not included.
The y is not included in q of x.
Divided by,
so that 5 there we have.
We have x minus 2 squared.
x plus 2 squared.
And look at it.
I'm getting rid of both of those.
Both of those.
If I plug in 2 now,
it's 2 plus 2 is 4.
16.
That is analytical.
So we say that
x sub 0 equals 2
is a regular.
It is a regular
singular point.
Because if I construct these two equations,
they are both analytic for this value.
Now you can do the same for negative 2
and see what happens.
Do the same for the other singular points.
So first you have to identify the singular points
depending on what your a sub 2 of x was.
Clearly see here if it equals to 0,
this will make this equation
non-analytical.
You construct this p of x, q of x.
Put your singular point in there.
If you get that they both have to be analytical.
If they are,
then you can call this a regular singular point.
And what you can very quickly see here
is because we square this,
in the denominator,
this x minus x sub 0
for p of x
cannot be larger than
the power of smaller at least
or larger
than the power
of 1.
That's the power of 1.
So
in the,
in the,
in this
denominator
as it stands for p of x
I have the fact that
x minus 2 is just raised to the power of 1.
It cannot have been raised
to the power of 2.
If I have the same factor
as the x minus x sub 0
and there it is,
if I have it in the denominator
of the p of x
larger than a power
of 1,
what,
of 1,
it would be an irregular point.
And for p of x,
if I find my x minus x sub 0
raised to a power
higher than 2
in the denominator
of p of x
I immediately know
it's going to be non-analytical
and an irregular point
because we have this
power 1
and squared in there.
So it's,
it's very quickly,
you don't have to do all of this,
you'll quickly note
if in the p of x
in its denominator
if this factor
is,
is,
is apparent
or exists
to a power
higher than 1
in this p of x's denominator
it's not going to work.
if this
appears in q of x's denominator
raised to the power
higher than 2
it's going to be
an irregular point.
Okay,
so we can now
differentiate between
regular and irregular
singular points.
Next,
we're going to look
at a solution
around that
irregular singular point.
