The text introduces the concept of integration by examining how to calculate the area under a curve using Riemann sums. It focuses on finding the area beneath the graph of the function \( y = 1 - x^2 \) within the first quadrant, bounded by the y-axis (\(x=0\)), the x-axis (\(y=0\)), and the vertical line at \(x=1\).

To estimate this area, two rectangles are initially used. The interval from \(a=0\) to \(b=1\) is divided into \(n=2\) equal parts, each with a width of \(\frac{1-0}{2} = 0.5\). The height of the first rectangle is determined by evaluating the function at \(x=0\), resulting in a height of 1. Thus, its area is \(1 \times 0.5 = 0.5\).

The second rectangle's height is found by evaluating the function at \(x=0.5\), giving a height of \(\frac{3}{4}\). Its area is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 0.5 = \frac{3}{8}\).

Adding these areas together results in an estimated total area of \(\frac{7}{8}\), which overestimates the true area under the curve. The method used here, where rectangle heights are taken from the left endpoints, is known as "upper sums" or "left hand Riemann sums."

The text suggests that using more rectangles with smaller widths will yield a more accurate estimate of the area, and this technique of summing parts to approximate integrals is foundational in integration. Further exploration and examples of Riemann sums are promised in subsequent content.
