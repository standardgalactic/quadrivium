The text introduces the concept of integration by examining how to calculate the area under a curve using Riemann sums. It focuses on finding the area beneath the graph of the function \( y = 1 - x^2 \) within the first quadrant, bounded by the y-axis (\(x=0\)), the x-axis (\(y=0\)), and the vertical line at \(x=1\).

To estimate this area, two rectangles are initially used. The interval from \(a=0\) to \(b=1\) is divided into \(n=2\) equal parts, each with a width of \(\frac{1-0}{2} = 0.5\). The height of the first rectangle is determined by evaluating the function at \(x=0\), resulting in a height of 1. Thus, its area is \(1 \times 0.5 = 0.5\).

The second rectangle's height is found by evaluating the function at \(x=0.5\), giving a height of \(\frac{3}{4}\). Its area is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 0.5 = \frac{3}{8}\).

Adding these areas together results in an estimated total area of \(\frac{7}{8}\), which overestimates the true area under the curve. The method used here, where rectangle heights are taken from the left endpoints, is known as "upper sums" or "left hand Riemann sums."

The text suggests that using more rectangles with smaller widths will yield a more accurate estimate of the area, and this technique of summing parts to approximate integrals is foundational in integration. Further exploration and examples of Riemann sums are promised in subsequent content.

The text introduces the concept of integration by examining how to calculate the area under a curve using rectangular approximations. Specifically, it considers finding the area under the graph \( y = 1 - x^2 \) within the first quadrant and between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \). The method involves dividing this area into two rectangles of equal width, where each rectangle's height is determined by evaluating the function at specific points along the x-axis.

- The left boundary is the y-axis (\( x = 0 \)), and the bottom boundary is the x-axis (\( y = 0 \)).
- Two rectangles are used to approximate the area. Each has a width of \( \frac{1}{2} \) (since the interval from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \) is divided by two).
- The heights are determined at specific points: the first rectangle's height is \( f(0) = 1 \), and the second rectangle's height is \( f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{3}{4} \).

The areas of these rectangles are calculated as follows:
- First rectangle: \( \text{Area} = 1 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Second rectangle: \( \text{Area} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8} \)

Adding these areas gives a total of \( \frac{7}{8} \). This approximation tends to overestimate the actual area under the curve.

This method is referred to as using "upper sums" or "left-hand Riemann sums," where the height of each rectangle is determined from the left side of its base. By increasing the number of rectangles (making their width smaller), a more accurate estimate of the area can be achieved, leading toward the concept of integration through summation of infinitesimally small parts. The text suggests that further exploration of this technique will occur in subsequent discussions or videos.
