Let's break down the problem and solution step-by-step:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Energy Levels in Hydrogen-like Atoms:**
   - The energy of an electron in a hydrogen-like atom (single-electron systems) is given by:
     \[
     E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV} \times Z^2}{n^2}
     \]
   - Where \( Z \) is the atomic number and \( n \) is the principal quantum number.

2. **Comparing Helium Ion (\( \text{He}^{+} \)) and Lithium Ion (\( \text{Li}^{++} \)):**
   - For helium ion (\( \text{He}^{+} \)), \( Z = 2 \).
   - For lithium ion (\( \text{Li}^{++} \)), \( Z = 3 \).

3. **Objective:**
   - Find the lowest three sets of quantum numbers (\( n_{\text{He}} \) and \( n_{\text{Li}} \)) such that:
     \[
     E_{n_{\text{He}}}(\text{He}^{+}) = E_{n_{\text{Li}}}(\text{Li}^{++})
     \]
   - This translates to:
     \[
     \frac{Z_{\text{He}}^2}{n_{\text{He}}^2} = \frac{Z_{\text{Li}}^2}{n_{\text{Li}}^2}
     \]

### Solving the Equation

1. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute \( Z_{\text{He}} = 2 \) and \( Z_{\text{Li}} = 3 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{n_{\text{He}}^2} = \frac{9}{n_{\text{Li}}^2}
     \]

2. **Cross-Multiply:**
   - Rearrange to find:
     \[
     9n_{\text{He}}^2 = 4n_{\text{Li}}^2
     \]
   - Solve for \( n_{\text{Li}}^2 \):
     \[
     n_{\text{Li}}^2 = \frac{9}{4}n_{\text{He}}^2
     \]

3. **Find Integer Solutions:**
   - To ensure both \( n_{\text{He}} \) and \( n_{\text{Li}} \) are integers, let:
     \[
     n_{\text{Li}} = \frac{3}{2}n_{\text{He}}
     \]
   - Since \( n_{\text{Li}} \) must be an integer, \( n_{\text{He}} \) must be even.

4. **Calculate Possible Values:**
   - If \( n_{\text{He}} = 2 \), then:
     \[
     n_{\text{Li}} = \frac{3}{2} \times 2 = 3
     \]
   - If \( n_{\text{He}} = 4 \), then:
     \[
     n_{\text{Li}} = \frac{3}{2} \times 4 = 6
     \]
   - If \( n_{\text{He}} = 6 \), then:
     \[
     n_{\text{Li}} = \frac{3}{2} \times 6 = 9
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The three lowest sets of quantum numbers where the energies are equal are:
     - \( (n_{\text{He}}, n_{\text{Li}}) = (2, 3) \)
     - \( (n_{\text{He}}, n_{\text{Li}}) = (4, 6) \)
     - \( (n_{\text{He}}, n_{\text{Li}}) = (6, 9) \)

These pairs satisfy the condition that the energy levels of helium ion and lithium ion are equal for these specific quantum numbers.

The text describes a process for calculating specific electron energies using the atomic numbers (Z) and principal quantum numbers (n) for helium, lithium, and hydrogen. The focus is on determining the three lowest energy levels in an electron's energy level diagram (often referred to as "electron balls"). By equating the formula for these energies with different Z and n values—specifically Z=2 with n=2, 4, and 6; and Z=3—the author finds the corresponding energies: -13.6, -3.39, and -1.51 electron volts (eV). The process involves simple algebra to match the energy levels of different atomic configurations by canceling out other variables.
