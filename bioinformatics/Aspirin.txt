In this snapshot, I discuss surgical aspects of the patient on aspirin.
Now, patients on a high dose of aspirin, that usually means higher than 100 mg per day,
have been shown to have a high risk of perioperative bleeding, the need for transfusion,
the need for reoperation, and a prolonged hospital stay.
A low dose, that is less than 100 mg per day,
has been shown to increase blood loss during surgery,
but do not increase the need for transfusions, reoperations, or hospital stay.
Now, preoperative bleeding time does not correspond with these measures either.
So, aspirin administration should be discontinued 5 to 7 days prior to elective surgery whenever possible.
Now, minor emergency procedures can be performed without any emission of intake.
And in the case of a major emergency surgery,
or surgery in which bleeding may be deleterious to outcome, such as neurosurgery,
platelets may be administered.
Desmopressin may be given as an adjunct.
