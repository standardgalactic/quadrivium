Having had a look at the sum of cosines, I will now show you the sum of sines.
I will assume the same four expressions as in the previous video, a equals x plus y
and b equals x minus y.
And therefore x equals a plus b over 2 and y equals a minus b over 2.
Through substitutions and the use of trigonometric identities, I find that the sine of a equals
the sine of x plus y, and that equals the sine of x cosine of y plus the sine of y times
the cosine of x.
And that the sine of b equals the sine of x minus y and that is the sine of x times the
cosine of y minus the sine of y times the cosine of x.
Through addition, I get that the sine of a plus the sine of b equals two times the sine
of x times the cosine of y.
And substituting leaves the sine of a plus the sine of b is equal to two times the sine
of a plus b over two times the cosine of a minus b over two.
I get that the sine of A minus the sine of B equals 2 times the sine of Y times the cosine of X
and substituting leaves that the sine of A minus the sine of B equals 2 times the sine of A minus B over 2
times the cosine of A plus B over 2.
