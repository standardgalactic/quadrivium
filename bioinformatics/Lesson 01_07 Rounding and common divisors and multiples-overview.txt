The text explains various methods for rounding numbers and finding common divisors and multiples:

1. **Rounding Numbers**:
   - The `round` function rounds to the nearest integer. For example, 3.4 becomes 3.0, while 3.5 rounds up to 4.
   - To always round towards positive infinity, use the `ceiling` function. For instance, ceiling(3.001) results in 4 and ceiling(-3.999) gives -3.
   - The `floor` function rounds towards negative infinity. So floor(3.999) is 3, and floor(-3.001) is -4.
   - To round towards zero, use the `trunc` or `truncate` function. Trunc(3.999) results in 3, while trunc(-3.999) also gives -3.

2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:
   - GCD finds the largest number that divides a set of numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, for the numbers 4, 8, and 20, the GCD is 4 because it divides all three evenly.

3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - LCM identifies the smallest common multiple shared by a set of numbers. For instance, among 2, 3, 5, and 10, the LCM is 30 as it's the smallest number into which all these can divide without a remainder.

These methods are useful for various mathematical calculations.

The text provides an overview of rounding numbers and finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM). Here's a summary:

### Rounding Numbers:
- **Round Function**: Rounds to the nearest integer. For example, 3.4 rounds down to 3.0, while 3.5 rounds up to 4.
- **Ceiling Function** (`CEIL`): Always rounds towards positive infinity. So, 3.001 becomes 4 and -3.999 becomes -3.
- **Floor Function**: Rounds towards negative infinity. For example, 3.999 rounds down to 3, and -3.001 rounds down to -4.
- **Truncation** (`trunc`): Forces rounding toward zero. Thus, both 3.999 and -3.999 truncate to 3.

### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):
- The GCD is the largest number that can divide a set of numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, for 4, 8, and 20, the GCD is 4 because it divides each number evenly.

### Least Common Multiple (LCM):
- The LCM is the smallest multiple that is common to all numbers in a set. Using the example numbers 2, 3, 5, 10:
  - Multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 30
  - Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, ..., 30
  - Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, ..., 30
  - Multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30
- The LCM for these numbers is 30 as it's the smallest number that each can divide into without leaving a remainder.

The text suggests that understanding and using GCD and LCM can be beneficial in various calculations.
