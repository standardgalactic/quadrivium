The text explains various methods for rounding numbers and finding common divisors and multiples:

1. **Rounding Numbers**:
   - The `round` function rounds to the nearest integer. For example, 3.4 becomes 3.0, while 3.5 rounds up to 4.
   - To always round towards positive infinity, use the `ceiling` function. For instance, ceiling(3.001) results in 4 and ceiling(-3.999) gives -3.
   - The `floor` function rounds towards negative infinity. So floor(3.999) is 3, and floor(-3.001) is -4.
   - To round towards zero, use the `trunc` or `truncate` function. Trunc(3.999) results in 3, while trunc(-3.999) also gives -3.

2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:
   - GCD finds the largest number that divides a set of numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, for the numbers 4, 8, and 20, the GCD is 4 because it divides all three evenly.

3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - LCM identifies the smallest common multiple shared by a set of numbers. For instance, among 2, 3, 5, and 10, the LCM is 30 as it's the smallest number into which all these can divide without a remainder.

These methods are useful for various mathematical calculations.
