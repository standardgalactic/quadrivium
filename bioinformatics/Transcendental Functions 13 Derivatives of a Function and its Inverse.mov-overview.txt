The text explains the relationship between a function and its inverse in terms of their derivatives. It highlights that the derivatives of a function \( f(x) \) and its inverse \( f^{-1}(x) \) are reciprocals at corresponding points.

Using the example where \( f(x) = x^2 \) on the domain \( [0, \infty) \), making it one-to-one and allowing an inverse to exist. The derivative of this function is \( f'(x) = 2x \). Its inverse is \( f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x} \), with a derivative \( (f^{-1})'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} \).

These derivatives are reciprocals at corresponding points. For instance, evaluating the function and its inverse at specific x-values illustrates this: 
- At \( x=3 \) for \( f(x) \), the derivative is 6.
- The reciprocal of this (1/6) matches the derivative of \( f^{-1}(x) \) at \( x=9 \).

The text emphasizes that when comparing these values, one must swap the x and y coordinates due to the nature of inverse functions. Thus, if the slope of the tangent line to \( f(x) \) is 6 at some point (3, 9), then the slope of the tangent line to its inverse function will be 1/6 at the corresponding point (9, 3). This reciprocal relationship between derivatives holds true for points where the x and y values are swapped.
