Archimedes' Principle states that when a body is fully or partially submerged in a fluid and remains static (not moving), it experiences a buoyant force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to its weight. This principle can be observed by measuring the apparent weight of an object submerged in a fluid, which will be less than its actual weight due to this buoyant force.

When discussing Archimedes' Principle:

1. **Apparent Weight**: The scale reads the normal force exerted on the object, which is reduced when the object is submerged due to the upward buoyant force.
   
2. **Static Equilibrium**: For a submerged object in equilibrium, the sum of forces (including gravity and buoyancy) must be zero.

3. **Buoyant Force**: The buoyant force equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

4. **Density and Volume Considerations**: If an object is partially submerged, its density compared to the fluid determines how much it submerges. The mass of the object equals the mass of the displaced fluid, leading to the equation: 
   \[
   \text{density of object} \times \text{volume of object} = \text{density of fluid} \times \text{volume of fluid displaced}
   \]
   
5. **Calculating Submersion Height**: The height to which an object submerges in a fluid is determined by the ratio of its density to that of the fluid, and can be calculated using:
   \[
   h_{\text{submerged}} = \left(\frac{\text{density of object} \times h_{\text{object}}}{\text{density of fluid}}\right)
   \]
   where \(h_{\text{object}}\) is the full height of the object and \(h_{\text{submerged}}\) is the submerged height.

This principle helps solve problems involving buoyancy, such as determining how much an object will sink into a fluid based on its density relative to the fluid's density.
