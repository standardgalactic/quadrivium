Archimedes' Principle states that when a body is fully or partially submerged in a fluid and remains static (not moving), it experiences a buoyant force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to its weight. This principle can be observed by measuring the apparent weight of an object submerged in a fluid, which will be less than its actual weight due to this buoyant force.

When discussing Archimedes' Principle:

1. **Apparent Weight**: The scale reads the normal force exerted on the object, which is reduced when the object is submerged due to the upward buoyant force.
   
2. **Static Equilibrium**: For a submerged object in equilibrium, the sum of forces (including gravity and buoyancy) must be zero.

3. **Buoyant Force**: The buoyant force equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

4. **Density and Volume Considerations**: If an object is partially submerged, its density compared to the fluid determines how much it submerges. The mass of the object equals the mass of the displaced fluid, leading to the equation: 
   \[
   \text{density of object} \times \text{volume of object} = \text{density of fluid} \times \text{volume of fluid displaced}
   \]
   
5. **Calculating Submersion Height**: The height to which an object submerges in a fluid is determined by the ratio of its density to that of the fluid, and can be calculated using:
   \[
   h_{\text{submerged}} = \left(\frac{\text{density of object} \times h_{\text{object}}}{\text{density of fluid}}\right)
   \]
   where \(h_{\text{object}}\) is the full height of the object and \(h_{\text{submerged}}\) is the submerged height.

This principle helps solve problems involving buoyancy, such as determining how much an object will sink into a fluid based on its density relative to the fluid's density.

The video explains Archimedes' Principle, which states that a body submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. This principle applies when the body is in static equilibrium and not moving within the fluid.

When an object is placed on a scale, its weight (mg) equals the normal force exerted by the scale. However, submerging it in a fluid reduces this apparent weight because of the buoyant force acting upwards, which decreases the normal force read by the scale.

In problems involving Archimedes' Principle, one common question is determining how much of an object will submerge in a fluid. This depends on the densities and volumes involved. The principle states that the mass of the submerged part of the object equals the mass of the displaced fluid. Therefore, density times volume (mass) for the object must equal density times volume for the displaced fluid.

For partially submerged objects, their height above the fluid is less than if they were fully submerged. To find how much of an object submerges, set the product of its density and total volume equal to the product of the fluid's density and the submerged volume. The areas touching the fluid are equivalent for both the object and displaced fluid, simplifying calculations.

The height at which the object is submerged can be calculated by dividing the product of the object's density and full height by the fluid's density. This gives the submerged height (h_submerged).
