In the lecture, the primary topic is the initial stage of research: formulating a hypothesis. Researchers are required to develop specific predictions or educated guesses about their findings before starting empirical investigations. The speaker will cover two critical types of hypotheses that should be clearly defined before commencing any research activities. This step is vital as it determines the study's direction and focus.
