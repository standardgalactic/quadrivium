The text introduces the method of undetermined coefficients using the superposition approach for solving non-homogeneous linear higher-order ordinary differential equations. This technique is applicable when the right-hand side of the equation, denoted as \( g(x) \), takes specific forms such as constants, polynomials, sine or cosine functions, exponential functions like \( e^{\alpha x} \), or finite sums/products of these types. The method involves making an educated guess for the particular solution based on the form of \( g(x) \).

The text highlights that this approach is limited to certain function forms because their derivatives maintain a similar structure as the original function, which simplifies finding solutions. For example, polynomials remain polynomials upon differentiation, and sine or cosine functions turn into each other. However, it cannot be used for transcendental functions like \( \ln(x) \), \( 1/x \), or tangent functions, since their derivatives do not maintain the same form.

The process of solving involves first finding the complementary solution by treating the non-homogeneous equation as a homogeneous one (setting \( g(x) = 0 \)) and applying previously learned methods. The complementary solution addresses the associated homogeneous equation, while the superposition approach is used to find the particular solution corresponding to the non-homogeneous part. Combining these solutions yields the general solution to the original differential equation.
