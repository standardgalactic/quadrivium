The text provides rules for handling powers in multiplication and division, along with explanations on negative exponents. Here's a summary:

### Products of Powers
When multiplying expressions with the same base, add their exponents:
\[ a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n} \]
**Example**: \( 2^3 \times 2^4 = 2^7 \)

### Quotients of Powers
When dividing expressions with the same base, subtract the exponent in the denominator from the numerator:
\[ \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \]
**Example**: \( \frac{x^5}{x^2} = x^3 \)

### Important Notes
1. **Same Base Requirement**: Rules apply only if bases are identical.
2. **Zero Exponent Rule**: Any non-zero base raised to the zero power equals 1 (\( a^0 = 1 \)).
3. **Negative Exponents**: A negative exponent indicates a reciprocal:
   \[ a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \]

### Example Application
Simplify \( 2^3 \times 4 \times x^6 \times y^5 \times x^4 \times y \):
- Rewrite 4 as \( 2^2 \): 
  \[ 2^3 \times 2^2 \times x^6 \times x^4 \times y^5 \times y^1 \]
- Apply product of powers:
  - For base 2: \( 2^{3+2} = 2^5 \)
  - For base x: \( x^{6+4} = x^{10} \)
  - For base y: \( y^{5+1} = y^6 \)

Resulting in:
\[ 32x^{10}y^6 \]

### Understanding Negative Exponents
- Definition: \( x^{-a} = \frac{1}{x^a} \)
- Example: \( 2^{-3} = \frac{1}{8} \), or \( \frac{1}{x^{-3}} = x^3 \)

These rules facilitate simplifying expressions involving exponents.

The text explains how to handle fractions with negative exponents and provides a foundational understanding of exponential notation involving fractional powers or radicals.

### Key Points:

1. **Negative Exponents**: 
   - A fraction like \( \frac{1}{y^{-b}} \) can be rewritten as \( y^b \).
   - Negative exponents are defined only for nonzero bases, e.g., \( x^{-a} \) requires \( x \neq 0 \).

2. **Fractional Exponents**:
   - An expression like \( x^{a/b} \) represents the \( b \)-th root of \( x^a \), written as \( \sqrt[b]{x^a} \).
   - Examples include square roots (\( x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x} \)) and cube roots (\( x^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{x} \)).

3. **Combining Radicals**:
   - When radicals have the same index, they can be combined under a single radical: \( \sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{y} = \sqrt{xy} \).

4. **Different Indices**:
   - If indices differ, manipulate expressions to combine them when possible.

5. **Exponent Properties**:
   - The property \((a^x)(b^x) = (ab)^x\) is verified by example: for \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( x = 4 \), both sides equal 1296, confirming the rule.

These principles help simplify expressions involving negative exponents and fractional powers.

The text provides an overview of exponentiation and logarithmic properties, highlighting their significance in data analysis and algebra. It begins with an example involving powers of 3 and 2, illustrating that \(3^4 \times 2^4 = (3 \times 2)^4\), resulting in 1296, which is confirmed by multiplying the individual powers: \(81 \times 16 = 1296\).

Next, it defines logarithms as the inverse of exponentiation. For a base \(b\) and number \(x\), \(\log_b(x) = y\) if and only if \(b^y = x\). An example provided is \(\log_{10}(1000) = 3\).

The text outlines key properties of logarithms:
- **Product Rule**: \(\log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)\)
- **Quotient Rule**: \(\log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)\)
- **Power Rule**: \(\log_b(x^c) = c \cdot \log_b(x)\)
- **Change of Base Formula**: \(\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_c(x)}{\log_c(b)}\)

Examples are given to illustrate these properties:
- \(\log_{10}(3 \times 4) = \log_{10}(3) + \log_{10}(4)\)
- \(\log_{10}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \log_{10}(3) - \log_{10}(4)\)
- \(\log_{10}(100^3) = 3 \cdot \log_{10}(100)\)
- \(\log_7(5) = \frac{\log_{10}(5)}{\log_{10}(7)}\)

The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of practicing these concepts, especially for those enrolled in related courses.
