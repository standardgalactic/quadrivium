The text discusses two physics problems: sound level measurement with multiple sources and Doppler shifts involving moving observers and sources.

### Sound Level Measurement:
- A single typist typing produces a sound of 60 decibels. When three typists each typing at the same intensity are placed in a room, the total sound level isn't simply additive (i.e., not 180 dB). This is because sound levels are measured on a logarithmic scale.
- The intensity \( I \) for one typist is calculated as \( 10^{-12} \times 10^{60/10} = 10^{-6} \, \text{watts/m}^2 \).
- For three typists, the total intensity becomes \( 3 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{watts/m}^2 \).
- The new sound level is calculated using: 
  \[
  \beta_{\text{total}} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{3 \times 10^{-6}}{10^{-12}}\right) = 65 \, \text{dB}
  \]
- This shows that while intensities add linearly, the decibel scale results in a smaller increase due to its logarithmic nature.

### Doppler Shifts:
1. **Observer Moving Towards Source**:
   - An observer moving towards a stationary source experiences an increased frequency because waves appear to bunch up.
   
2. **Source and Observer Moving Relative to Each Other**:
   - When both the source (chase car) and observer are moving, their relative velocities affect the observed frequency.
   - The chase car is traveling at 30 m/s, while the observing car moves at 20 m/s. Both move in the same direction as defined by a unit vector from the observer to the source.
   - The observed frequency increases because they are moving closer together: 
     \[
     f' = 1,200 \times \frac{340 - 15}{340 - 30} \approx 1,220 \, \text{Hz}
     \]
   - The calculation considers directionality and relative motion without relying on apparent distance changes.

In summary, the text explores how sound intensity and frequency are affected by multiple sources and movement, emphasizing the non-linear nature of decibel scales and directional components in Doppler effect calculations.

The text appears somewhat disjointed, but it seems like the person is discussing a preference or interest in understanding specific perspectives or viewpoints ("on the right of the shoulder") related to some kind of group or team dynamics. They are not simply interested in identifying which consortium or group might emerge as dominant; instead, they want to thoroughly understand their own side's position and possibly uncover details about it ("out our side of our side of the cyst"). This suggests a desire for deeper insight into their group's strategies or characteristics.
