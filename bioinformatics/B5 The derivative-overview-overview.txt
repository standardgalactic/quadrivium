The text provides a concise overview of derivatives for several key types of functions without offering proofs:

1. **Exponential Functions**: For \( f(x) = a^x \), where \( a \) is constant, the derivative is \( a^x \ln(a) \). This applies to non-polynomial transcendental functions.

2. **Natural Exponential Function**: The derivative of \( e^x \) is \( e^x \).

3. **Logarithmic Functions**: For \( \ln(x) \), the derivative is \( \frac{1}{x} \).

4. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - Derivative of \( \sin(x) \) is \( \cos(x) \).
   - Derivative of \( \cos(x) \) is \( -\sin(x) \).

5. **Sum/Difference Rule**: Differentiate the sum or difference by differentiating each function separately and then adding or subtracting the results.

These rules are essential for understanding rates of change in various applications, such as growth trends.
