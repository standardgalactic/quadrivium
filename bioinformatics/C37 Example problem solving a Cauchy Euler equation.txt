Now let's have a look at another problem. Again we notice that it's x squared and our derivative is to the second derivative, x to the power 1 first derivative, x to the power 0 no derivative.
So we can suggest that our answer is going to be in the form y equals x to the power m, y prime is going to be x, m times x to the power m minus 1 and then y prime prime is going to be m squared minus m, x to the power m minus 2.
We've just done that in one step. If I substitute all of this, if I would substitute all of this, I'm going to be left with 4x squared and then an m squared minus m and an x to the power m minus 2.
I'm going to have a positive 8x and then I'm going to have an m and an x m minus 1 and I'm going to have plus an x to the power m and that should equal 0 still.
In other words, I'm going to be left with 4m squared minus 4m and I can take x to the power m out and then here I'm going to be left with plus 8m and here I'm going to be left with plus 1 equals 0.
In other words, I'm going to have 4m squared plus 4m plus 1 equaling 0 and if we just factor out, I think that's 2m plus 1 squared equals 0.
So, in other words, 2m equals negative 1 and m equals negative 1 half.
So, that is m sub 1 and m sub 2 being the same.
So, my answer is going to be c sub 1.
I'm going to have x to the power negative 1 half plus c sub 2, another x to the power negative 1 half, but I've got to add to that the natural log of x.
So, my answer is going to have x to the power negative 1 qui to the power negative 1 x to the power negative 1 half.
surrounding x to the powerئ to the power negative 1 with b plus 05 0.
So, I'll try.
So, I'll attach the power negative 1 minus 2 type 0 and then I'll add innings as well which is the power negative 1.
So, I'm going to have x to the power negative 2 be comma 2 plus 2 and then I'll add innings a little bit F11 wholly 0 and Costa Rica.
So, I'll add in the dimension of 1 w � a 2.
So, I'll just add innings a little bit of 2 came sur 2.
So, that is a form of 380, which will fit your edektó library to the Most level.
