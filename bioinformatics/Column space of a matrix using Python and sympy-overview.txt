To understand what you're describing, let's break down the concepts involving matrices, their transformations, and their spaces.

### Concepts Overview

1. **Column Space**: The set of all possible linear combinations of the column vectors of a matrix. It represents the span of these columns in vector space.
   
2. **Null Space (or Kernel)**: The set of all solution vectors \( \mathbf{x} \) that satisfy \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \), where \( A \) is your matrix and \( \mathbf{0} \) is the zero vector.

3. **Rank**: The maximum number of linearly independent column vectors in a matrix (or row vectors). It gives an indication of the dimension of the column space.

4. **Nullity**: The dimension of the null space, given by the formula \( \text{nullity} = n - \text{rank} \), where \( n \) is the number of columns in the matrix.

5. **Elementary Row Operations and RREF (Reduced Row Echelon Form)**: These operations include row swapping, scaling rows, and adding multiples of one row to another. The goal is often to simplify a matrix while preserving its rank or other structural properties.

### Applying Concepts

Let's discuss the matrices you have:

1. **Square Matrix with Linearly Independent Columns**:
   - For such a matrix \( A \), if it has 3 linearly independent columns (full rank for a \( 3 \times 3 \) matrix), its column space is all of \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).
   - Performing row operations to reach RREF will result in the identity matrix, maintaining the full span of \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).

2. **Square Matrix with Linearly Dependent Columns**:
   - For a matrix where one column is dependent (e.g., third column is the sum of the first two), the rank drops to 2.
   - The nullity increases by 1, indicating there's at least one non-zero solution vector in the null space.
   - The column space now spans a plane within \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) (not all of it).

### Python and SymbPy

When using libraries like SymPy for such operations:

- **Column Space**: You can use functions to extract linearly independent columns, which form the basis.
  
- **Row Operations/RREF**: Use the `rref` method on a matrix object. This will give you the reduced row echelon form and the pivot positions.

Here's a quick Python snippet using SymPy:

```python
from sympy import Matrix

# Example of a 3x3 matrix with linearly independent columns
A = Matrix([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
rref_A, pivot_columns = A.rref()
print("RREF of A:", rref_A)

# Example of a 3x3 matrix with linearly dependent columns
B = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 9], [7, 8, 15]])
rref_B, pivot_columns = B.rref()
print("RREF of B:", rref_B)

# Column space of A
col_space_A = A.columnspace()
print("Column Space of A:", col_space_A)

# Column space of B
col_space_B = [B[:, i] for i in pivot_columns]
print("Column Space of B:", col_space_B)
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Elementary Row Operations**: They change the matrix but preserve row equivalence. This means they affect the column space, potentially reducing its span.

- **Column Spaces and Dependencies**: A full rank square matrix spans all \( \mathbb{R}^n \), while a rank-deficient one spans only a subspace (like a plane in 3D).

Understanding these concepts helps analyze how transformations like row reductions affect the geometric interpretation of matrices.

Certainly! Let's break down the concepts and observations youâ€™ve made about column spaces, null spaces, and elementary row operations.

### Column Space and Rank

1. **Column Vectors in 3D Space**: 
   - You have matrices where each column vector is an element of \(\mathbb{R}^3\). If you have three linearly independent vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^3\), they span the entire space, \(\mathbb{R}^3\).

2. **Rank and Linear Independence**:
   - The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent column vectors it has.
   - For a \(3 \times 4\) matrix (three rows and four columns), you can have at most three linearly independent vectors. Thus, one column must be a linear combination of the others.

### Null Space

1. **Nullity**:
   - The nullity of a matrix is the dimension of its null space, which is calculated as the number of columns minus the rank.
   - For a \(3 \times 4\) matrix with rank 3, the nullity is \(4 - 3 = 1\). This means there is one basis vector in the null space.

2. **Basis for Null Space**:
   - The null space consists of all vectors \(x\) such that \(Ax = 0\).
   - For a matrix with more columns than rows, the null space will have dimension greater than zero, and its basis vectors are elements of \(\mathbb{R}^4\) (since there are four columns).

### Elementary Row Operations

1. **Effect on Column Space**:
   - Elementary row operations do not change the linear independence of column vectors but can alter which specific vectors are identified as part of the basis for the column space.
   - While these operations preserve the rank, they generally result in a different set of columns being selected as a basis.

2. **Row Reduction**:
   - Row reducing a matrix to row echelon form or reduced row echelon form can simplify identifying linearly independent columns and the null space.

### Rectangular Matrices with More Rows than Columns

1. **Column Space in \(\mathbb{R}^5\)**:
   - For a \(5 \times 3\) matrix, each column vector is an element of \(\mathbb{R}^5\).
   - If the rank is 3, all three columns are linearly independent and form a basis for a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^5\).

2. **Subspace Spanning**:
   - The column space in this case is a three-dimensional subspace within \(\mathbb{R}^5\), not the entire space.

### Summary

- **Column Space**: Determined by linearly independent columns, spanned by these vectors.
- **Null Space**: Comprises solutions to \(Ax = 0\); its dimension is determined by nullity.
- **Row Operations**: Preserve rank but can change which columns form a basis for the column space.
- **Matrix Shape**: Affects whether column vectors span the entire space or just a subspace.

Understanding these concepts helps in analyzing how matrices transform vector spaces and solve systems of linear equations.

The text provides an explanation of elementary row operations and their effects on matrices, particularly focusing on column spaces. Here's a summary:

1. **Elementary Row Operations and Gauss-Jordan Elimination**: The text emphasizes that performing Gauss-Jordan elimination to achieve reduced row echelon form alters the column space of a matrix.

2. **Column Space Differences**: It illustrates how different sets of basis vectors span distinct column spaces in \(\mathbb{R}^5\). For example, some columns may contain non-zero entries in positions where others are zero, indicating they do not span the same subspace.

3. **Linear Dependence and Rank**: The text discusses linear dependence within a matrix with more rows than columns, showing how rank determines the dimension of the column space. A matrix's rank is tied to its nullity (dimension of the null space), as seen in an example where the rank is two, leading to a nullity of one.

4. **Null Space Stability**: It notes that while elementary row operations change the column space, they do not affect the null space or the row space (except in special cases).

5. **Vector Space Properties of Column Space**: The text concludes by proving that the column space of any matrix is a vector subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). This proof involves showing that the column space contains the zero vector, and it's closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

6. **Implications for Invertibility**: Finally, it explains why matrices with linear dependence (and hence non-trivial null spaces) cannot be invertible, as they map multiple vectors to the same result in their column space.

The video aims to clarify these concepts, particularly how elementary row operations impact the properties of a matrix's column space and relate to broader topics like matrix invertibility.
