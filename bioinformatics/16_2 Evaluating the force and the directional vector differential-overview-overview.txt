The text outlines a method for evaluating the line integral of a vector field \(\mathbf{F}\) along a curve, which is mathematically expressed as \(\int \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}\). Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Definition**: The line integral represents the work done by the force field on an object moving along a specified path.

2. **Vector Field Components**: Express \(\mathbf{F}\) in terms of its components as \(M(x, y)\mathbf{i} + N(x, y)\mathbf{j}\), where \(M\) and \(N\) are functions depending on coordinates \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **Differential Element**: The differential element \(d\mathbf{r}\) is expressed as \(dx \mathbf{i} + dy \mathbf{j}\).

4. **Integral Expression**: The line integral is formulated as \(\int (M dx + N dy)\), involving the dot product of \(\mathbf{F}\) and \(d\mathbf{r}\).

5. **Curve Parametrization**: Use a parameter \(t\) to define the curve, leading to expressions for \(x = x(t)\) and \(y = y(t)\). This results in differentials \(dx = \frac{dx}{dt} dt\) and \(dy = \frac{dy}{dt} dt\).

6. **Substitution**: Substitute these parametrizations into the integral, yielding:
   \[
   \int (M(x(t), y(t)) \frac{dx}{dt} + N(x(t), y(t)) \frac{dy}{dt}) dt
   \]

7. **Vector Formulation**: This can be rewritten in vector notation as:
   \[
   \int (\mathbf{F}(x(t), y(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t)) dt
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) is the derivative of the position vector with respect to \(t\).

This approach allows for calculating line integrals by parametrizing the curve and utilizing dot product properties.
