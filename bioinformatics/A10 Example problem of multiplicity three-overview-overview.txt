Here's a summarized explanation of how to find eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and construct the general solution for a specific 3x3 matrix:

1. **Matrix Description**: The matrix is upper triangular with all diagonal elements equal to 2 and zeros below the diagonal.

2. **Characteristic Equation**:
   - Subtract \( \lambda I \) from the matrix to form a new matrix.
   - Calculate its determinant, resulting in the equation \( (2-\lambda)^3 = 0 \).

3. **Eigenvalue**:
   - The characteristic equation yields a single eigenvalue \( \lambda = 2 \), with algebraic multiplicity of 3.

4. **Eigenvectors**:
   - Use \( A - 2I \) to find eigenvectors.
   - Only one linearly independent eigenvector is found, indicating geometric multiplicity of 1.

5. **General Solution**:
   - Generalized eigenvectors are needed due to the eigenvalue's multiplicity.
   - Solve \( (A - 2I)^2 p = k \) and \( (A - 2I)^3 q = p \), where \( k \) is the initial eigenvector.

6. **Constructing Solutions**:
   - Combine these vectors into a general solution using exponential functions related to the eigenvalue.
   - Express the solution as a linear combination of three solutions: \( x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t) \), each with arbitrary constants \( c_1, c_2, c_3 \).

The text concludes by noting that these vectors form a complete set of solutions and are not constant multiples of one another.
