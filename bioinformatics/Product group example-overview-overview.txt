The text describes constructing a product group from two cyclic groups, each denoted as \( C_2 \), containing two elements: an identity element (E) and a non-identity element (τ). The Cartesian product of these groups results in four combined elements: (E, E), (τ, E), (E, τ), and (τ, τ). Operations on this product group are defined by composing corresponding components from each pair using the operations within \( C_2 \).

A Cayley table illustrates how these pairs interact under composition rules, confirming that all outcomes adhere to group properties. The elements of one \( C_2 \) are renamed as A and B, while those of another are D and E, simplifying operation descriptions in the product group.

The text further explores permutations on a union of two sets, identifying four specific permutations: 
1. Identity permutation (A → A, B → B, C → C, D → D).
2. Swapping C and D with A and B unchanged.
3. A combined transformation involving swaps and additional changes to A and B.

These permutations form a set isomorphic to the Klein 4 group, illustrating how combining two cyclic groups \( C_2 \) results in this structure. The text highlights that these operations directly correspond to the Klein 4 group, showcasing the simplicity of product groups in abstract algebra.
