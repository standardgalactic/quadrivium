Let's have a look at this problem.
Evaluate this line integral on the line segment between the given points.
So we go from point in 3 space from 101 to 312.
And our function here is xy plus z.
So where shall we start?
Let's have a look at this curve of ours.
So we go from some initial point to some final point along a line segment.
So if we have 312 and we subtract from that 101,
we are left with 2, 1, 1.
So that would be the difference or that would be a vector between those two points.
And what we will do now is construct a new vector for this line segment.
Which will just be x, y and z values.
Which will be at our starting point.
1, 0, 1.
Plus t times this change.
2, 1, 1.
So if you had linear algebra you would understand what's happening here.
But we'll multiply it out and we'll have a quick look.
And t will be an element of, well we usually say t goes from time equals 0 to time equals 1.
But have a look at this.
What will x equal, if these are all vectors, vectors, vectors, what will x equal?
x will equal 1 plus 2t.
1 plus 2t.
So if y equals t and y goes from 0 to 1, that means t goes from 0 to 1 as well.
Okay, so we have that.
Let's have a look at our function of our vector x.
In other words x, y and z.
I don't like writing all the components.
I just make it into a vector.
Now that x has nothing to do with that x.
This is vector x with its components.
That was x, y plus z.
If we now make a new function of our new vector r.
A small function f.
But with this as an argument now.
The vector r in t.
That's x times y.
So that's 1 plus 2t.
Times y is this t.
Plus z which is 1 plus t.
So that's going to equal t plus 2t squared plus 1 plus t.
That leaves us with 2t squared plus 2t plus 1.
So that'll be our new function.
The other thing that we need is x prime of t.
Well, there's x.
So that'll just be 2t.
2t because we do remember this is just in x, not the ds.
So we remember that dx was going to be x prime of t dt.
Because, let's try and remember.
The line integral going over some curve of a function of a vector.
In one specific direction.
It's a small change in x with respect to x.
That is going to equal from some initial time to some final time.
Of a function now in this vector of ours.
Of x prime of t dt.
Now, I like to always mark these things in green.
Green for me means a definition.
Or an equation that I have to remember.
So that's the equation we're working from in Sydney.
We've gotten all these elements.
So there's our t equals a and b.
That's the 0 and the 1.
The f of this new vector r.
There it is.
X prime of t we've got.
It's there.
Dt because we've changed dx into x prime of t dt.
So that is going to be the different integral going from 0 to 1.
Of 2t squared plus 2t plus 1.
Times.
What is this?
X prime of.
Did I make a mistake?
I think indeed I did.
Because.
X is 1 plus 2t.
So x prime of t.
Is this 2.
Is this 2.
So multiplied by this constant 2.
Which I can bring outside of the integral sign.
And all of it dt.
That's going to equal 2 times.
That's 2 over 3t to the power 3.
Plus t squared plus t.
All going from 0 to 1.
That's going to leave me with a 2.
And that is 2 over 3 plus 1 plus 1.
That equals 2 times 2 over 3.
Plus 2.
That will give me 16 over 3.
16 over 3.
16 over 3.
