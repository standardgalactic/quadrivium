The text provides an introduction to handling strings in Julia, focusing on how to define, manipulate, and print strings with different requirements.

1. **Defining Strings**:
   - Strings are enclosed in double quotation marks (e.g., `"this is a Julia string"`).
   - Using triple quotes (`"""`) allows for including quotation marks within the string itself without needing escape characters.

2. **Printing Strings**:
   - Directly calling a variable that stores a string includes the quotation marks.
   - The `print` function outputs only the content, excluding quotation marks.

3. **Including Quotation Marks in Strings**:
   - Triple quotes or backslash escape sequences (e.g., `\"`) are used to include quotation marks within strings.

4. **Escape Characters**:
   - Backslashes (`\`) serve as escape characters to indicate that the following character should be treated literally rather than as part of code syntax.
   - This is demonstrated with examples like escaping a dollar sign when using it in string interpolation.

5. **String Interpolation**:
   - Dollar signs are used for variable substitution within strings (e.g., `$variable`).
   - To include a literal dollar sign, escape it using `\`.

The text concludes by hinting at future discussions on substrings and further exploration of string manipulation in Julia.
