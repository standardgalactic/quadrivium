How do we calculate the length of a curve if we are just given a simple equation y equals to f of x on an interval from a to b?
Well, we simply write it in parametric form.
First we set x to a new parameter, namely t, and that gives us a new function of y, namely y equals to f of t.
If our initial function represented a curve on an interval, we now have two parametric equations describing this curve,
and we can use our equation to determine the length of this curve on an interval from a to b, namely the definite integral in going from a to b of the square root of the first derivative of the first function squared times the first derivative of the second function squared with respect to t.
To avoid confusion, let us use Leibniz notation.
If x equals t, then dx dt equals 1, and if y equals the f of t, then dy dt equals f' of t.
From our knowledge of the chain rule and parametric equations, we can divide these functions, leaving us here.
Simplifying means dy dx equals f' of t.
Now let us square each first derivative, and use it in our equation for the length of a curve between two points.
We know that dx dt squared is 1, and dy dt squared is the f' of t squared.
Substituting gives us this equation.
Since we have already shown that f' of t is equal to dy dx, and we have set x equal to t,
We have a formula for the length of a curve on an interval for a continuously differentiable function.
