The text discusses solving an initial value problem for a differential equation where \( y' = e^{-x^2} \). This equation is separable but cannot be explicitly solved in terms of \( y \) with respect to \( x \). Instead, the solution is expressed as an integral. 

To solve it, we use the fundamental theorem of calculus. By separating variables and integrating, we express the solution for \( y \) in terms of a definite integral from 3 to \( x \), specifically:

\[ y(x) = 5 + \int_{3}^{x} e^{-t^2} \, dt \]

Here, \( y(3) = 5 \) is used as the initial condition. The solution cannot be simplified further due to the complexity of the integral of \( e^{-t^2} \), but it is left in this form, which fully satisfies the problem's requirements.
