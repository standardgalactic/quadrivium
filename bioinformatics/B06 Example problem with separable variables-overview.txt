The text discusses solving an initial value problem for a differential equation where \( y' = e^{-x^2} \). This equation is separable but cannot be explicitly solved in terms of \( y \) with respect to \( x \). Instead, the solution is expressed as an integral. 

To solve it, we use the fundamental theorem of calculus. By separating variables and integrating, we express the solution for \( y \) in terms of a definite integral from 3 to \( x \), specifically:

\[ y(x) = 5 + \int_{3}^{x} e^{-t^2} \, dt \]

Here, \( y(3) = 5 \) is used as the initial condition. The solution cannot be simplified further due to the complexity of the integral of \( e^{-t^2} \), but it is left in this form, which fully satisfies the problem's requirements.

The text discusses solving a differential equation where an explicit solution in terms of \( y \) cannot easily be obtained. The problem involves the differential equation \( y' = e^{-x^2} \), which is separable and presented as an initial value problem. Since finding a closed-form antiderivative for \( e^{-x^2} \) is difficult, the solution is expressed in terms of an integral.

The approach involves using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to express the solution as:

\[ y(x) = y(3) + \int_{3}^{x} e^{-t^2} \, dt. \]

Given that \( y(3) = 5 \), this becomes:

\[ y(x) = 5 + \int_{3}^{x} e^{-t^2} \, dt. \]

This integral form is the solution to the initial value problem, acknowledging that it's not possible to simplify further due to the complexity of integrating \( e^{-x^2} \).
