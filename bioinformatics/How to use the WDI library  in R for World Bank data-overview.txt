The text provides a walkthrough on accessing and using open data from the World Bank via an R package called WDI. It explains how to navigate the available indicators on topics such as agriculture, aid effectiveness, climate change, and economic growth. The user highlights how each indicator is uniquely named and accessible through URLs.

Using R's Markdown for analysis, a tutorial is set up focusing on maternal mortality ratios. Here, the author outlines setting up an R environment with packages like WDI (World Bank Data API library) for data extraction, Plotly for graphing, and Deedle for handling data frames. The setup involves configuring file paths, working directories, and using CSS for styling.

In practice, the tutorial demonstrates searching for specific indicators, such as maternal mortality ratios, by name or country code. It includes executing a search via `WDI::search` with detailed parameters like string, field, and whether to return full details (short = FALSE). 

The example proceeds with fetching data for specific countries using their ISO 2C codes—US for the United States, BR for Brazil, and ZA for South Africa—from 2005 to 2015. The function `WDI::wdi` is used to pull in relevant data, specifying that only essential variables should be returned (extra = FALSE). 

The tutorial then touches on examining the output data frame within RStudio and hints at how additional information might be accessed by setting extra = TRUE during the search. This feature would include more metadata such as ISO 3C codes and country-specific values associated with each indicator.

The text describes a process for creating an interactive plot using geographical and statistical data from Brazil, USA, and South Africa (ZA). The author uses R programming with packages like `leaflet` for map plotting and `Plotly` for interactive graphs. They filter the dataset to include only these three countries based on their ISO 2C codes using the `dplyr` package.

The focus is on maternal mortality rates from 2005 to 2015, and the data are visualized with Plotly by creating separate traces for each country's data (Brazil, USA, ZA). The x-axis represents years, while the y-axis shows the count of maternal mortality per 100,000 births. Customizations include scatter plots with lines and markers, titles, axis labels, and a layout that avoids thick black lines.

The final plot is interactive, allowing users to hover over data points to see specific values. The author notes poor performance in South Africa's maternal mortality rates around 2010-2011 and mentions resources for further exploration of the WDI package and issues related to maternal health in South Africa.
