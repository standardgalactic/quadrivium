so remember if we go remember my equation 2 here all I've got to do now is I'm going to solve for
x sub 1 so that I can plug it into equation number 1 and now solve for x sub 2 so let's
start with this let's start with equation number 2 let's get that in the picture for you so we're
starting with equation number 2 which was x sub 2 x sub 2 of s and we had s squared plus 4 minus 4
times x sub 1 of s that was negative 1 so what we can do now is let's just solve for x sub 1
so if I take that over to the other side I'm going to have 4 times x sub 1 of s and that's going to
equal x sub 2 of s and an s squared plus 4 and I'm going to have positive 1 I've taken the negative
over to that side this over to this side so x sub 1 of s that is going to be a quarter x sub 2 of s
s squared plus 4 plus a quarter and let's call this let's call this equation number 4 now I'm going to
take equation number 4 and plug it back into equation number 1 and remember what equation
number 1 is do we still have it here somewhere there was equation number 1 x sub 1 of s is squared
plus 10 minus 4 times x sub 2 so I'm just going to replace the x sub 1 there so that I just have
x sub 2's so that I can solve for x sub 2's okay so my equation number 1 was x sub 1 of s which is now
a quarter x sub 2 of s s squared plus 4 plus a quarter that was my x sub 1 of s there it still
has to be multiplied by an s squared what was it plus it was supposed to be s squared plus 10 there
a negative 4 times x sub 2 of s and that had to equal that had to equal 1 okay let's multiply this s
squared plus 10 inside of these brackets I'm going to have a quarter times x sub 2 of s s to the s
squared plus 4 and then s squared plus 10 plus I'm going to have another quarter times s squared plus 10
minus 4 times x sub 2 of s minus 4 times x sub 2 of s and that equals 1 I'm going to multiply it
throughout by 4 so I'm going to have x sub 2 of s you can multiply these out s to the power 4 plus 14
s squared plus 40 I'm going to have an s squared plus 10 on this side that is going to be minus 16 x sub 2 of s
and that's going to equal 4 so let's get x sub 2 on its own this is what we're after if we do that
we are left with s to the power 4 plus 14 s squared plus 40 minus 16 just as we had before and on this
side we're going to have 4 minus s squared minus 10 same story that we're going to have now x sub 2 of s
that is going to equal we have a negative s squared minus 6 so that's positive 6 that's what we have there
where did my ruler go and on the bottom we're going to have exactly the same denominator as we had before
in other words s squared plus what was it 12 and s squared plus 2 which is going to give me that 24 there
now partial fractions again and you're going to see we're going to land up in the same
same problem so let's have negative s squared plus 6 and we have let's go through this exercise again
it's first year calculus work to do these partial fractions and it's always good exercise to do
something that you used to be at least very familiar with when you were slightly younger
so s squared plus uh that's s squared plus 2 so we're going to have a negative you know s squared
plus 6 and that is going to equal 8 times we're going to have a s squared plus 2 and a b and s squared
plus 12 once again there's nothing i can square to give me a 0 there or 0 there i've got to invoke
s z equals s squared my complex number here and let's set the z equal to negative 2 to start off
with so remember this now is z which is negative 2 plus 6 6 minus 4 is 2 and let's see the it's 4
so it's 10 so this is negative 10 equals the a is going to fall out the b is going to be negative
negative 2 squared is 4 as 14 14 b in other words b is going to be negative 10 over 14 which divided by
2 let's see if i made another silly little mistake yeah probably um remember now i have to
um that was a negative so that's not definitely not 10 oh i hate it when i'm in this kind of uh
brain function mode that i can't even do simple uh simple simple mathematics so that's going to become
a z let me just do this my brain is clearly not functional this morning so let's put a z in there and a z in
there and a z in there because i'm being quite silly so if i put it if i put a negative 2 in there
that's going to be 4 so this will be a negative 4 and if i put a negative 2 in there that is going to
be a if i put a negative 2 in there that's going to be a 10 so what am i left with it's negative um
uh for uh for b let me just see is that a negative 10 yes indeed and that has got to be a
uh 6 minus 2 is 4 negative 4 let me just have a quick look z plus 6 is what i did before
i said it equaled as negative 4 so i'm going to have negative 2 over 5 eventually you would cry out
uh the answer well before i get to it as you can see clearly the brain is not functional today so
i've got a negative 12 there so that gives me negative 6 that gives me a 6 equals and on this
side negative 12 is negative 10 so that's negative 10 a in other words i'm going to have a equal to
negative 3 over 5 okay so we are getting somewhere so we're going to have x sub 2 except 2 of s
is going to equal this negative which i still have to distribute in so a why my a was or was it no i've
already distributed it in so that's not an issue so clearly that's not an issue so we're going to
have a negative 2 over 5 over s squared plus s squared plus 2 and we're going to have a negative 3 over 5
and s squared plus 12 eventually eventually eventually eventually we're going to get that now it becomes
simple we're just going to get the inverse laplace transform on both sides let me do this properly now
so that's x sub 2 of s that is going to be the inverse laplace transform of let's do that it's going to be
negative 2 over 5 over s squared plus 2 and plus the negative inverse laplace transform of negative 3
over 5 over s squared plus 12 that's very easy to do this is going to become x sub 2 of t
the inverse laplace transform of that it's going to equal i'm bringing the negative 2 over 5 out
i have the inverse laplace transform of s squared plus 2 which is just the square root of 2 squared
this is the square root of 2 squared so that i can put a square root of 2 there which means i've got to
put a 1 over square root of 2 there i don't like square root of 2's in the denominator of an answer
so i do that all in one go here i'm going to bring the negative 3 over 5 out i am left with the inverse
laplace transform of summing over s squared plus 12 which is the square root of 12 squared so that
becomes the square root of 12 so that becomes 1 over what was it 2 square root of 3 and i have to
multiply by square root of 3 over square root of 3 that leaves me x sub 2 of t equals so this becomes
2 which goes with that so i'm left with a negative square root of 2 over 5 here and that would be the
sine of square root of 2t you could already recognize that this 3 this 3 and that 3 will go so this is
negative the square root of 3 over 10 over 10 let's just make sure that i've got the answer correct now
seeing that seeing that things are not too rosy in my mind this morning sine of square root of 12 is
2 square root of 3t and beautifully i've solved my problem it's taken me a long long time these are
long problems easy to make tiny little mistakes but so beautiful that we can use the laplace transform
then the inverse laplace transform we use complex numbers to do our to do i didn't show you the whole
method there we chucked away the the imaginary part just kept the real part in the end but i did my
partial fractions there and then i had to use the inverse laplace transform to get back to my x sub 1
and x sub 2 and i had to recognize what was left of my inverse laplace transform to turn it into
something that i could use i had to put these new numerators there i had to bring them out i had to
neaten things up all in all it's a very good exercise this first kind of problem to do in the morning
just to get the mind going properly
