The lecture introduces basic statistics by analyzing 22 integer values from a medical test dataset, focusing on calculating the mean, median, and mode as representative measures of central tendency.

1. **Mean**: The average value is computed by summing all numbers in the set and dividing by their count. For instance, with values like 2, 4, and 6, the mean is 4. Spreadsheet functions can facilitate this calculation across larger data sets.

2. **Median**: This represents the middle value when numbers are ordered sequentially. With an even number of values, such as 22, it's the average of the two central figures. The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean; for example, changing a single value from 16 to higher figures (30 or 100) significantly impacts the mean but not the median.

3. **Mode**: This is the most frequently occurring number in the dataset. In this case, 16 appears more often than any other number and thus is identified as the mode.

The lecture emphasizes that while these three measures provide insights into the data's central tendency, they each serve different purposes depending on specific contexts, especially when dealing with outliers. Additionally, it discusses software compatibility for statistical functions in various spreadsheet applications.
