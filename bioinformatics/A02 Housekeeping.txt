Now that we've been formally introduced, let's have a look at what this course is
all about. We're going to discuss the common acute surgical conditions. I will
exclude though any pediatric surgical conditions. That's a field all on its own.
So this course is primarily for students who want to know more about acute care
surgery, but even for doctors who face these conditions on a daily basis. A few warnings
though, this is not going to be a comprehensive review of all the topics. We're going to discuss
principles only. It is most definitely not a do-all recipe for all cases. Remember medicine
is both a science and an art. Listen to your instructors and most importantly read the literature.
So we'll start off lecture one with the acutely inflamed appendix. See you then.
