The text introduces the concept of "relations" in mathematics, building upon the idea of a product set. A relation is defined as a subset of the product set formed by pairing elements of a set \(A\) with itself.

To illustrate, consider a set \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). An example of a relation on this set is "divides," which pairs elements where one divides the other without remainder. This results in specific ordered pairs like (1,1), (2,2), and so forth.

Another example uses a set \(A\) containing natural numbers from 1 to 20, with a relation defined by multiplication by 3. The resulting pairs are those that satisfy this condition, such as (1,3) or (2,6).

The text emphasizes the use of product set notation to describe these relations and points out that while some texts may present elements in different orders (e.g., (4,2) vs. (2,4)), both representations are valid depending on context.

Finally, it introduces binary relations as those involving pairs from \(A\) onto itself, setting the stage for further exploration of their properties.
