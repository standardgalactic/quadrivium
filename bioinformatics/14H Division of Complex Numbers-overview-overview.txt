The text provides an exploration into complex numbers and solving linear equations using two different mathematical methods: Cramer's Rule and Gauss-Jordan elimination. Here’s a summary of each part:

1. **Complex Conjugate Proof:**
   - The task is to prove that the complex conjugate of \( z^2 \) (where \( z = a + bi \)) equals the square of its own complex conjugate.
   - By expanding and calculating, it's shown:
     - \( z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 \).
     - The conjugate of \( z^2 \) is \( a^2 - b^2 - 2abi \).
     - The square of the complex conjugate \( \overline{z} = (a - bi)^2 = a^2 - 2abi - b^2 \), which matches the conjugate of \( z^2 \).
   - Conclusion: Both expressions are equal, proving the initial statement.

2. **Solving Linear Equations with Cramer's Rule:**
   - The system of equations is represented as \( Ax = b \). The determinant of matrix \( A \) is calculated to ensure it's non-zero (\(\text{det}(A) = -4\)), allowing the use of Cramer’s Rule.
   - Solving for variables involves replacing columns in \( A \) with vector \( b \) and calculating determinants:
     - Results are: 
       - \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} + i \)
       - \( x_2 = 2 \)
       - \( x_3 = \frac{1}{2} - i \).
   - Conclusion: Cramer's Rule provides the solutions for the variables.

3. **Using Gauss-Jordan Elimination:**
   - An augmented matrix with complex numbers is used:
     - Initial rows: [2, -1, -i] and [0, -1+i, 1].
   - The first row is modified to have a leading 1 by multiplying by ½.
   - This modified row is then used to eliminate the corresponding element in the second row, resulting in a zero row after subtraction:
     - Resulting Row 2: [0, 0, 0].
   - This indicates one free variable, \( x_2 \), which can be chosen arbitrarily (e.g., \( x_2 = t \) or simplified as \( x_2 = 2t \)).
   - Solving for \( x_1 \) leads to the equation: \( x_1 = 1 + it \).
   - Conclusion: The solutions are parametrically expressed as \( x_1 = 1 + it \) and \( x_2 = 2t \), showcasing a method of handling free variables in linear systems with complex coefficients.
