In this section we want to discuss Green's Theorem, and that relates a double integral over a bound region in the plane to a line integral over the curve that bounds that surface.
And we'll do a problem or two, and what it boils down to is actually the reverse of what we said there, that you'd be given a line integral to do over a closed curve, bounding a certain region there.
And it might very well be that that is not too easy to do, and then you can use Green's Theorem to change that line integral into a double integral.
So what is Green's Theorem? Marked with a green arrow there, check mark, because it means I would use green for definitions and for equations that I want to remember.
So we have this curve C, and it must be piecewise smooth, it must be simple, and it must be a closed curve in the XY plane.
So all these things need to be present for you to use Green's Theorem.
It's got to be directed anticlockwise, and the reason why it has to be done anticlockwise,
you'll see later that we use the curl, and because we use the curl in a certain direction,
we use the first component and the second component of F, the vector F first, then let that concern you,
but because of that we have to go anticlockwise, and we let R be the region bounded by C.
So those things have to be there.
Now, if F can then be written as this component vector of two components,
if F is a smooth two-dimensional vector field, then this line integral F dr, F dot dr,
with F and R being vectors, equals, I can write it in another way,
as this closed, this integral of a closed curve of m dx plus n dy.
That's one way to write it, the way, and we'll see why we can write it in that way, just shortly.
But more importantly, Green's Theorem states is I can now turn this into a double integral over region R,
enclosed by this closed curve of di n, di x minus di m, di y, with respect to that area d e.
So only for closed curves, you might be led to use these things, or to use Green's Theorem,
where it does not apply and don't be caught out like that.
So why can I write the second part of this closed interval over a curve C of m dx plus n dy,
while if F equals m and n, and dr can be written as a vector dx dy,
then F dot dr is this m comma n dot product dx dy, and that gives me m dx plus n dy.
So that's just how you can rewrite F dot dr as m dx plus n dy.
We can also write this f dot dr, or the closed curve, or the closed curve integral of m dx plus n dy,
we can also write it as a double integral.
We've just seen we can write it as this double integral, but we can also write it as a double integral
of the curl of F dA.
Why can I do that?
Why are those two things the same?
Well, once again, if F equals m comma n, then the curl of F is the del operator cross product with vector F,
and I take the, means I take the determinant of this 2 by 2 matrix.
That's one way to do it, and if I take the determinant,
I'm just left with n sub x minus m sub y, or dy n dy x minus dy m dy y.
So if that is the, if the curl of F equals that,
then in green it's very easy to see the other form that I can write Green's theorem in.
So now that we know how to use Green's theorem,
please, please, please make sure the curve C must be closed,
it must be piecewise smooth,
it must be simple,
and it must enclose this region R.
And F must also be a smooth two-dimensional vector field.
It needn't be a conservative vector field.
As I say, we're going to look at examples where F is not a conservative vector field,
so if the path is closed, that means it's not simply going to be zero.
The line integral is certainly not just going to be zero on a closed path, closed curve.
And then you use Green's theorem to relate that line integral to a double integral.
If we go to Green's theorem, it's certainly not
