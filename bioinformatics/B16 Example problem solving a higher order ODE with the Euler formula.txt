always good to do some examples so let's do higher order equation we're going to use the
Euler formula I want to remind you it's y double prime being a function of xy and y prime and we
need to create two first order equations such that y prime equals u u prime is then y double
prime which is now a function of xy instead of y prime we have y prime equals u so that'll be u
and mind you how we go on to y sub n plus 1 u sub n plus 1 and x sub n plus 1 and here's our example
we have y double prime equals 4y prime minus 4y here we have x being 0 x being 0 and this y double
prime remember that's equal to u u and y of 0 equals 1 so there's my y equals 1 my u equals 2
and I put these points afterwards because I want to tell python that these are floating point values
and we're going to use a step size of 0.01 so I'm going to print x and y as just as strings
just as the letters themselves x and y physically those and they are not variables they are in
string quotation marks and then this backslash t is the code for a tab so we're going to have another
tab there where we print these initial values of x and y we're going to do our loop again while x enters
the loop being less than a value of 1 we're going to have y n equals y remember yeah I'm going on to the
next y the y sub n plus 1 using the old y so this will be the new y if I just had y there and not
the y sub n but I before I change the value of y I gave it to and that same value as I enter y sub n
to another variable and I just called it y n could call it anything else as long as I then put it there
so that is four times y prime that's four times u remember this is u so for that I'm going to use
this equation here it's four times u minus four times y so four times u and four times y but that's
the old y I'm going to do my step size I'm going to print x and y and I'm going to loop through again
let's see what happens run run the module it says I made some changes I have to save first which it
does for me and there you can see all the values and look what the tab had done putting in the tab
just neatly arranged the two answer sets for x and y neatly for me and there I see it run all the way
through and I can read off the different values for x and corresponding y values
