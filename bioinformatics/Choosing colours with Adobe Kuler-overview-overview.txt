When designing websites, courseware, or online videos, maintaining a consistent color scheme is essential for brand recognition. A prime example is Coca-Cola's iconic red color. Tools such as Adobe Color (formerly Kuler) assist in creating effective color palettes. Hereâ€™s how to use Adobe Color:

1. **Create Custom Colors**: Generate up to five complementary colors, which are sufficient even with a white background.
2. **Explore Themes**: Browse Popular, Most Used, or Random themes created by others under the Explore section and customize any theme you like.
3. **Use Harmony Tools**: For those uncertain about color choices, use tools like Complementary Colors from the drop-down menu to ensure harmony in your selections.
4. **Save and Export Your Theme**: Save your custom theme with a unique name (e.g., Alpha) under My Themes and download it as an .ase file for use in software such as Photoshop or Illustrator.

Adobe Color helps select cohesive color palettes that enhance the visual appeal of your designs.
