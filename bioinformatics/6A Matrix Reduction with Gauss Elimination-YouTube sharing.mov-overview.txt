The text provides an overview of using matrices to represent and solve systems of linear equations. It introduces the concept of augmented matrices, which combine coefficients of variables from a set of linear equations with their respective constants on the right-hand side.

Key steps in solving these equations through matrix manipulation are explained:

1. **Elementary Row Operations**: These include interchanging rows, scaling rows to get leading ones, and adding multiples of one row to another to zero out elements below or above leading ones. The text outlines five specific steps:
   - Locate the first column without all zeros.
   - Interchange rows if necessary to bring a non-zero element to the top.
   - Scale the top row to make the leading entry 1.
   - Zero out entries below this leading one by adding scaled versions of the top row to lower rows.
   - Repeat the process for sub-matrices formed by ignoring completed rows.

2. **Example Application**: The text describes applying these steps to an example system of three equations with three unknowns (x, y, z), converting it into an augmented matrix and performing operations to reach a form where solutions can be easily identified.

3. **Row Echelon Form**: This is the stage reached after sufficient row operations, characterized by leading ones in each row and zeros below these leading ones. The text mentions that this form is often used by computer programs for solving matrices as it simplifies identifying solutions.

The process requires careful execution to avoid errors and understanding of basic algebraic principles applied to matrix operations.

The text describes a process to solve a system of linear equations using an augmented matrix and back substitution. Initially, an augmented matrix was constructed from a set of linear equations. The goal is now to verify the initial values for the unknowns \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) by reconstructing the original system from the matrix.

The reconstructed system of equations is:

1. \( x + 2y + 3z = 11 \)
2. \( y + 2z = 5 \) 
3. \( z = 1 \)

Starting with the third equation, we know \( z = 1 \). Using back substitution, this value is substituted into the second equation to solve for \( y \):

\[ y + 2(1) = 5 \]
\[ y + 2 = 5 \]
\[ y = 3 \]

Next, substitute the known values of \( y = 3 \) and \( z = 1 \) back into the first equation to find \( x \):

\[ x + 2(3) + 3(1) = 11 \]
\[ x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ x + 9 = 11 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Thus, the solution is verified as \( x = 2 \), \( y = 3 \), and \( z = 1 \).
