This video series focuses on fluids, starting with concepts related to density and pressure.

- **Density**: Defined as mass per unit volume (kg/m³ in SI units). For uniform density, it simplifies to mass divided by volume. Examples given include:
  - Air: ~1.21 kg/m³
  - Water at 20°C: ~998 kg/m³
  - Seawater: ~1,024 kg/m³

- **Pressure**: Defined as force per unit area (N/m² or Pascals in SI units). If pressure is uniform, it simplifies to force divided by area. Some related units are:
  - 1 atmosphere = \(1.01 \times 10^5\) Pascals
  - 1 torr = 1 mm of mercury

The speaker emphasizes understanding these concepts and basic units rather than memorizing them for exams, noting that in medicine, the term "millimeters of mercury" is still commonly used despite textbook recommendations.
