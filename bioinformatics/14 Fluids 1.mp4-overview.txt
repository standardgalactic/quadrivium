This video series focuses on fluids, starting with concepts related to density and pressure.

- **Density**: Defined as mass per unit volume (kg/m³ in SI units). For uniform density, it simplifies to mass divided by volume. Examples given include:
  - Air: ~1.21 kg/m³
  - Water at 20°C: ~998 kg/m³
  - Seawater: ~1,024 kg/m³

- **Pressure**: Defined as force per unit area (N/m² or Pascals in SI units). If pressure is uniform, it simplifies to force divided by area. Some related units are:
  - 1 atmosphere = \(1.01 \times 10^5\) Pascals
  - 1 torr = 1 mm of mercury

The speaker emphasizes understanding these concepts and basic units rather than memorizing them for exams, noting that in medicine, the term "millimeters of mercury" is still commonly used despite textbook recommendations.

This short video series introduces fluids, focusing initially on density and pressure.

- **Density**: Defined as mass divided by volume (kg/m³ in SI units). Uniform density can simplify this to simply mass/volume. The density of air is given as 1.21 kg/m³, water at 20°C is 998 kg/m³, and seawater is denser at 1,024 kg/m³ due to dissolved solutes.

- **Pressure**: Described as the force spread over an area (N/m² or Pascals in SI units). Uniform pressure simplifies to force divided by area. A few key pressure units are mentioned: 1 atmosphere equals 1.01 × 10⁵ Pascals, and 1 torr is equivalent to 1 mmHg, which remains a medical standard despite textbook variations.

The speaker emphasizes understanding over memorization of units, acknowledging the complexity involved in remembering all relevant conversions.
