Let's tackle this problem then. We have x plus y plus x minus yi equals 3 plus i and solve for x and y.
Now it's clear that this is our real part and there's our imaginary part, referring to the 3 and referring to this 1 in front of the i.
So I can easily set up two equations. I can say x plus y equals 3 and I have x minus y equals that 1, referring to that 1.
It's simple to see that it will probably be 2 and 1. 2 and 1 is 3, 2 minus 1 is 1.
But to do that properly I can take this equation and say that's y plus 1, substitute it in there, y plus y equals.
y plus y plus 1 equals 3. Now that's 2y equals 2, y equals 1 indeed.
Put it in there, 1 plus 1 gives me x equals 2 to solve for that.
So if you could just clearly see that this was the real part and that was the imaginary part.
I suppose you could also have expanded this. You could say x plus y plus xi minus yi equals 3 plus i.
In which you could clearly then see again that x plus y is going to be 3 and that x minus y is going to be equal 1.
But that's pointless. Pointless to do that. It's clear to see from this actually that this is the real part.
That's the imaginary part. The real part, imaginary part of a complex number and you can set up two equations and solve.
Let's look at these two problems. I have to solve for the complex number z.
And there's nothing but simple algebra here. I can simply take this to the other side.
I'm left with z equals. I can look at the different components, the real components.
So that will be 3 minus 1 which is 2 and I'll have plus 2i plus another i that will be positive 3i.
Easy enough to do. On this side I can divide both the real and imaginary parts of this complex number by this negative 5.
leaving me z equals negative 5. 5 divided by negative 5 is negative 1. 10 divided by negative 5 is negative 2i.
Again, let's solve for z.
What we can do here is we can just get z on its own. We have negative 2z and then 2z so that leads me with z equals.
I have negative 2 plus 7i. So I'm going to take this over which becomes negative i.
I'm going to take over this negative which becomes a positive 3i and z is going to equal negative 2.
So there's a negative 2. I have 7i minus 6. 789 plus 9i.
So I did nothing other than not being concerned with these brackets that are here. I'm not multiplying anything there.
It's simple addition and subtraction and I can just solve for z on its own on the left-hand side
and simplify what it was on the right-hand side to make this integrate a complex number.
Let's do some simple multiplication here.
We have z1 and z2. We want the product z1, z2 of these two complex numbers.
So we're going to have a 3i and 1 minus i.
That is going to leave us with 3i minus 3i squared.
Well, i squared is negative 1. Negative 3 times negative 1 is 3.
So it's 3 plus 3i.
Let's do z1 squared, which is going to be 3i times 3i, which 3 times 3 is 9i squared.
i squared is negative 1, so that means that these are sort of negative 9.
Let's look at something that's not very more complicated, z1 and z2.
Again, let's get z1, z2, or z2, z1 as these complex numbers commute.
And so multiplying all of those out, a third.
Let's write it out over a third.
I'm going to have a half.
I can do that.
Again, the commute.
I'm going to have 2 plus 4i, and I'm going to have 1 minus 5i.
This is going to be 1 over 6.
2 times 1 is 2.
Negative 10i plus 4i.
Negative 20i squared.
That is a 6.
And I have 2, and I have 2, that is minus, negative 20 times negative 1, that's plus 20.
2 plus 20 is 22.
I'm going to be left with negative 6i.
And that equals 22 over 6, which is 11 over 3.
Minus 6 over 6 is 1i.
Let's quickly look at z1 squared.
So I'm going to have 3 times a third is a ninth.
I'm going to have 2 plus 4i, and another 2 plus 4i.
That is going to leave me with a ninth.
2 times 2 is 4, plus 2 times 4 is 8.
2 times 4 is 8, so that's plus 16i.
And that's going to be another plus 16i squared.
i squared is negative 1, which means it's going to be a ninth.
And 4 minus 16 is minus 12, plus 16i.
And you do this negative 12 over 9.
You can combine it by 3, so it's negative 4 over 3, plus 16 over 9i.
Quite simple to do.
Let's do this problem.
So in essence, we have 3.
We have 3 factors there.
This is really school algebra, except for the i, so let's do that.
4 times 4 is 16.
Negative 24, negative 24 is 48i, plus 36i squared.
And you can leave it there and multiply all these out,
and then you can have an i cubed, which is this negative i in as much as two of the i's.
If you have i cubed, i cubed, remember that's i times i squared, which is negative i.
Okay, or you can simplify this first, which might make it a bit easier.
That's 1 plus 2i.
I'm going to have 16.
This is going to be negative 36, which makes it minus negative 20, negative 48i.
And now you can multiply these two.
So I'm going to have a negative 20.
I'm going to have a negative 48i.
I'm going to have another negative 40i.
And I'm going to have a negative 96i squared, which will make it a positive 96.
Positive 96 minus the 20 is 76.
And minus this will be 85.
So you could have just, you know, carried on there,
but a simpler way of doing it probably is just to simplify this into standard complex number format
and then multiplying those two.
Let us simplify this expression.
We have a square root of 2 plus i and then negative i square root of 2 multiplied with 1 plus square root of 2i.
The only thing we need to distribute is this i square root of 2.
So we're going to have the square root of 2 plus i.
We have negative.
Let's put the square root of 2i.
Let's put it, just rewrite it like that.
So as not to get confused, we're going to have a negative.
We're going to have square root of 2 times square root of 2.
So that is this 2.
And we're going to have i squared.
Let's see if that is correct.
We have a square root of 2 times square root of 2, which gives us a 2.
We have i times i, which is i squared.
We have a negative times a positive, which is a negative.
So we're going to have square root of 2.
And this is negative 2 times negative 1, which is positive.
So that's 2 plus square root of 2.
And here I have positive i and negative a square root.
So that's going to give me positive 1 minus square root of 2i.
Or it will be written like this in many books, plus i, 1 minus square root of 2.
There we go.
