There are two basic forms of logarithms that are used most most often. The first
one is the common logarithm. Let's write that the common logarithm. And that
refers to the fact that if we simply... let's underline that. That means that we
usually write something like log... let's say log 400. What we actually mean by that
is log base 10 400. So when whenever there's no base written except the fact
that that is base 10. The second and one which is used a lot especially in physics
and which is a bit more difficult to get to grips with and that is the natural
logarithm. And that has a special base. Let's underline that. That has a special base
and that base is Euler's number. And you can look up what Euler's number is and I
might make some videos later about Euler's number. And that means the log
base E. E for Euler's number of 400. And there's a special way to write this. And
that is the natural log of 400. And that is the same as writing the log base E, base Euler's
number of 400. And many times in physics you'll just hear people say what is the log
log of 400. But what they mean by that is actually the natural log. And they write the natural log.
