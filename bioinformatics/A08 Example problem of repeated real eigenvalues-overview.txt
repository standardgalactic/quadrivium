The text provides an example from linear algebra involving finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a given 3x3 matrix \( A \). The process begins with determining the characteristic equation by calculating the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \), where \( \lambda \) is an eigenvalue. This results in a polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues.

In this case, the text finds two repeated eigenvalues (\( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -1 \)) and one distinct eigenvalue (\( \lambda_3 = 5 \)). For the repeated eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -1 \), it is determined that there are multiple eigenvectors, allowing for a set of solutions involving two linearly independent vectors.

The text outlines using Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve for these eigenvectors. For \( \lambda_3 = 5 \), since it's not repeated, only one eigenvector is needed and found through similar procedures.

Finally, the general solution involves combining the exponential terms associated with each eigenvalue and their corresponding eigenvectors: 

- Two solutions involving \( e^{-t} \) multiplied by their respective linearly independent eigenvectors for \( \lambda = -1 \).
- One solution involving \( e^{5t} \) multiplied by its eigenvector for \( \lambda = 5 \).

The text concludes that in cases of repeated real eigenvalues with multiple eigenvectors, it's unnecessary to use the more complex solutions typically needed when there are fewer independent eigenvectors than expected.

The text provides an example from a linear algebra context where we explore eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a \(3 \times 3\) matrix. The process begins with finding the characteristic polynomial by calculating the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \), which leads to a cubic equation in terms of \(\lambda\). For this specific matrix, two eigenvalues are repeated (\(-2\)), and one is distinct (5).

1. **Repeated Eigenvalue (\(-2\))**:
   - The solution involves solving for eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue \(-2\).
   - By setting up the system \((A + 2I)\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{0}\) and performing Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination, two linearly independent eigenvectors are found:
     - For \(\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -2\), eigenvectors might be of the form \( [1, 1, 0]^T \) and \( [1, 1, 1]^T \).

2. **Distinct Eigenvalue (5)**:
   - The solution for the distinct eigenvalue involves solving \((A - 5I)\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{0}\).
   - Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination yields a single eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue, such as \( [1, -1, 1]^T \).

The general solution is expressed in terms of these eigenvectors and their respective exponential functions:
- For the repeated eigenvalue \(-2\), solutions are linear combinations of eigenvectors multiplied by \( e^{-t} \).
- For the distinct eigenvalue \(5\), the solution involves an eigenvector multiplied by \( e^{5t} \).

The presence of more than one eigenvector for the repeated eigenvalue allows a straightforward combination without needing additional complex forms that involve powers of \( t \). This results in the final solution set being expressed as:
\[ 
c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} e^{-t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{-t} + c_3 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{5t}.
\] 

This explanation reflects a typical approach to solving systems of differential equations where the matrix has repeated eigenvalues.
