The text provides an example from linear algebra involving finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a given 3x3 matrix \( A \). The process begins with determining the characteristic equation by calculating the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \), where \( \lambda \) is an eigenvalue. This results in a polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues.

In this case, the text finds two repeated eigenvalues (\( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -1 \)) and one distinct eigenvalue (\( \lambda_3 = 5 \)). For the repeated eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -1 \), it is determined that there are multiple eigenvectors, allowing for a set of solutions involving two linearly independent vectors.

The text outlines using Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve for these eigenvectors. For \( \lambda_3 = 5 \), since it's not repeated, only one eigenvector is needed and found through similar procedures.

Finally, the general solution involves combining the exponential terms associated with each eigenvalue and their corresponding eigenvectors: 

- Two solutions involving \( e^{-t} \) multiplied by their respective linearly independent eigenvectors for \( \lambda = -1 \).
- One solution involving \( e^{5t} \) multiplied by its eigenvector for \( \lambda = 5 \).

The text concludes that in cases of repeated real eigenvalues with multiple eigenvectors, it's unnecessary to use the more complex solutions typically needed when there are fewer independent eigenvectors than expected.
