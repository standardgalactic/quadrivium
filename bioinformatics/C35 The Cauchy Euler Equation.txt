So in this section we are going to look at the Scalci-Euler equation.
Excuse the pronunciation.
Now what we clearly have to see is in this chapter
we are really just dealing with
higher order linear differential equations
with these non-constant variable coefficients
but only with special ones, those that can be solved
as far as y is concerned as an explicit solution
either in the form of a polynomial or transcendental function
as an example trigonometric or logarithmic or exponential function.
And these are quite special.
Later on in one of the chapters to follow
we are going to see that we can't explicitly solve y
in terms of either polynomial or transcendental function
but rather only we will be limited to solving it as a series at best.
So in this section we are going to be even more special
as far as these non-constant variables of ours
now a sub n denotes a sub n minus 1 until a sub 1
a sub 0 denote constants
but there is an independent variable x to the power n
x to the power n minus 1 until we get to x to the power 0
and what we note or why this is called this equation
what characterizes this equation is that we are quite fortunate
in that the power of the independent variable there
equals the order of the differentiation
so that's x to the power 2
it will be the second derivative of y
x to the power 1 will be the first derivative
and there we have the first derivative
x to the power 1 and the first derivative of y is x to the power 0
so just y
so that is what makes it this kind of equation
so we are going to start with the second order homogeneous equation
and from there we will build on to solving
higher order of these linear equations
but clearly you can see it is x squared
y prime prime
second derivative
x to the power 1 first derivative
x to the power 0 and just y
no derivative
now of course we can solve this by variational parameters
but we are going to look at another solution
just before we do that
please note though that if you just look at this
if I let x equal 0
we can solve
at least part of this equation
if we put it that way
so what we are going to do
we are going to restrict ourselves to this domain
of 0 to positive infinity
as far as the x values are concerned
we just
we are just
we are just
just using the fact that
that we are
sorry about that
that we are just restricting ourselves to this domain
now we are going to assume something
and that is that y equals x to the power m
is a solution
one of the solutions
and that is a nice thing to do
and later on we will see
it is
if we look at the answers we get
it is quite legitimate to do this
so if we have y equals x to the power m
we have y sub prime
and y sub prime prime
we just use the normal power rule
one of the first things you are learning calculus
and then we substitute it back into this equation of ours
so what are we left with?
what are we left with?
well let's have a look
we are going to be left with
ax squared
and then
this
m
m minus 1
etc etc
you can look at it
I can just clean things up a bit
because they have an x squared
and then
x to the power m minus 2
so it is x to the power 2
plus m minus 2
which just leaves me this x to the power m
I can take out x to the power m
as a constant factor here
I will be left with that
I can multiply this out
and I can clean up
because I have two functions in m there
two expressions in m
so I can clean that up
and lo and behold
I am left with this
am squared
m
m to the power 0
just a second order polynomial function
which I can just solve
normally
and that is going to leave me with three types of roots
as we had before with this
this is actually then called the auxiliary equation
no it is nothing other
this is nothing other than the auxiliary equation
so we are going to be left with three types of roots
either they are going to be real and distinct
m sub 1 and m sub 2
and this is the form
of the solution that we are going to get
and lo and behold
it does contain x to the power m
if the roots are real and equal
so m sub 1 equals m sub 2
I am going to have this x to the power m sub 1
x to the power m sub 1
but times the natural log of x
and we will see later how to expand that
if we have more than just the second order derivative
and then it can be a complex root
in that case we are going to have x to the power alpha
c sub 1 cosine of beta times the natural log of x
plus c sub 2 times the sine of beta times the natural log of x
those two get multiplied first
before you take the sine or the cosine
2 then we get to the kilometre times the half sine
to the halfEE time before you take the sine
for the cosine
of the cosine
