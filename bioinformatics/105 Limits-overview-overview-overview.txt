The text serves as a guide for using SymPy, a symbolic mathematics library in Python, to calculate mathematical limits. It begins by demonstrating how to import SymPy with the alias `SYM` and define variables as symbols. The main focus is on the `limit` function, which computes the limit of functions, such as calculating the limit of sin(X)/X as X approaches zero, resulting in 1.

The guide also explains using infinity in SymPy, represented by `SYM.oo`. It shows how to evaluate limits at infinity, like finding that the limit of 1/X as X approaches infinity is 0.

Moreover, it covers one-sided limits using the `dir` argument to specify approaching from the positive or negative direction, with examples showing how reaching zero from either side results in positive or negative infinity, respectively.

The text briefly discusses handling negative infinity and mentions considerations for efficient code execution within Python, including compatibility notes for Python 2.7.6 regarding certain syntax requirements.
