The lecture introduces the Feynman technique of integrating by differentiating under the integral sign. This method is applied to solve the definite integral of \(\sin(x)/x\) from zero to infinity, which is challenging due to the \(1/x\) factor.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the steps:

1. **Introduction**: The problem involves evaluating \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x} \, dx\). Traditional techniques struggle with this integral because of the singularity at \(x = 0\).

2. **Introducing an Auxiliary Parameter**: To solve it using Feynman's technique, a parameter \(b\) is introduced into the integrand: 
   \[
   \int_0^\infty e^{-bx} \frac{\sin x}{x} \, dx
   \]
   For \(b = 0\), this expression equals our original integral.

3. **Differentiating with Respect to \(b\)**: The next step involves differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to \(b\):
   \[
   \frac{d}{db} \int_0^\infty e^{-bx} \frac{\sin x}{x} \, dx
   \]
   By applying Leibniz's rule (differentiation under the integral sign), this becomes:
   \[
   -\int_0^\infty e^{-bx} \sin x \, dx
   \]

4. **Integration by Parts**: The resulting integral is simplified using integration by parts. This process involves choosing parts of the integrand to differentiate and integrate, leading to a recursive application of integration by parts.

5. **Solving the Recurrence**: By solving the recurrence relation obtained from integration by parts, it becomes possible to express the original problem in terms of simpler integrals or known results.

6. **Evaluating at \(b = 0\)**: Finally, evaluating the expression as \(b\) approaches zero yields the value of the original integral.

The Feynman technique is powerful because it transforms a difficult integral into a more manageable form by introducing an auxiliary parameter and leveraging differentiation under the integral sign.

The text outlines a mathematical process involving integration and differentiation to solve an integral problem. Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Setup**: The author starts by manipulating an equation involving integrals, bringing terms across the equals sign and factoring out common elements.

2. **Simplification**: The expression is simplified on both sides, leading to an equation that can be solved for the original integral.

3. **Verification with Code**: The solution is verified using a line of code in the Wolfram language, confirming the manual calculations.

4. **Derivative Calculation**: The derivative of the integral with respect to \( b \) is calculated, considering limits as \( x \) approaches infinity and zero.

5. **Integration for Original Function**: To find the original function \( i(b) \), both sides are integrated with respect to \( b \). This involves trigonometric substitution.

6. **Trigonometric Substitution**: By substituting \( b = \tan(\theta) \), the integral is simplified and solved, resulting in an expression involving the arctangent function.

7. **Determination of Constant**: The constant of integration is determined by considering the behavior of the function as \( b \) approaches infinity, leading to a specific value for the constant.

8. **Conclusion**: The solution involves the negative arctangent of \( b \) plus a constant, with the constant resolved through boundary conditions.

The text describes solving a mathematical problem using Feynman's technique of differentiating under the integral sign. The specific problem involves finding the definite integral from 0 to infinity of \(\sin(x)/x\) with respect to \(x\). Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Setting Up**: The text starts by mentioning solutions involving negative \(\pi/2\) and certain constants, culminating in an equation: \(i(b) = -\arctan(b) + \pi/2\).

2. **Solving for Specific Value**: To solve the problem, set \(b = 0\). This simplifies the expression to:
   \[
   i(0) = -\arctan(0) + \pi/2
   \]
   Since \(\arctan(0) = 0\), this results in \(i(0) = \pi/2\).

3. **Conclusion**: The solution to the integral is determined to be \(\pi/2\). This method highlights Feynman's technique as an elegant approach to solving such integrals.

4. **Additional Notes**: The text includes some metaphorical and informal language about the beauty of the process, but the core takeaway is that the definite integral from 0 to infinity of \(\sin(x)/x\) equals \(\pi/2\).
