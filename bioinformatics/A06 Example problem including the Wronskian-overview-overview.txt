The text outlines a method for solving a system of two coupled first-order linear differential equations using matrix techniques. Here's a summary:

1. **Equations Setup**: The original system is:
   \[
   \frac{dx}{dt} - 2x - 3y = 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dt} - 2x - y = 0
   \]

2. **Matrix Representation**: This system can be expressed in matrix form as:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   x' \\
   y'
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   2 & 3 \\
   2 & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   x \\
   y
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

3. **Finding Eigenvalues**: To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation from:
   \[
   \det(A - \lambda I) = 0
   \]
   leading to a quadratic equation:
   \[
   \lambda^2 - 3\lambda - 4 = 0
   \]
   The solutions are \(\lambda_1 = -1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 4\).

4. **Finding Eigenvectors**: 
   - For \(\lambda_1 = -1\), solve:
     \[
     (A + I)\mathbf{v} = 0
     \]
     Resulting in the eigenvector \([-1, 1]\).
   - For \(\lambda_2 = 4\), solve:
     \[
     (A - 4I)\mathbf{v} = 0
     \]
     Giving the eigenvector \([3, 2]\).

5. **General Solution**: The general solution is a linear combination of solutions for each eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector:
   \[
   \mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{-t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} e^{4t}
   \]
   where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants.

6. **Independence Check**: The solutions are verified to be linearly independent by checking that their Wronskian is non-zero, ensuring they form a complete set of fundamental solutions for the system.

This method allows the construction of the solution space, accommodating any initial conditions.
