The text describes an experiment involving plotting two variables against each other and observing their relationship. Initially, a parabola is observed rather than a straight line when these variables are plotted. While a straight-line segment (secant line) can be drawn between two points on the curve to represent the slope (change in y over change in x), this secant line doesn't lie perfectly on the curve.

The text explains that as you bring the two points closer together, making them infinitesimally close, the secant line approaches a tangent line. In calculus terms, this process describes finding the instantaneous rate of change or slope at a single point on the curve by letting the difference in x (delta x) approach zero.

The explanation further ties into foundational concepts from first-year calculus about how secant lines and slopes can be used to understand tangent lines and instantaneous rates of change. The text also includes fragmented references to mathematical discussions, suggesting deeper exploration or demonstration through interactive elements like group activities or presentations.
