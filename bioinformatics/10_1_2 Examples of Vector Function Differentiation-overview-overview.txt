The text explores differentiation of vector functions with an emphasis on defining smooth curves. Here's a summary:

### Key Concepts

1. **Instantaneous Velocity Vector**: For a position vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), the instantaneous velocity is found by taking the derivative of each component.

2. **Speed Calculation**: Speed is the magnitude (norm) of the velocity vector, calculated using trigonometric identities that can simplify expressions to constant values, indicating time-independent speed in certain cases.

3. **Path Description in 2D**: In some examples, like circular motion described by \( x^2 + y^2 = \text{constant} \), this implies a circular path with uniform speed but changing velocity direction (tangent to the circle).

4. **Uniform Circular Motion**: Though speed is constant, the changing direction of the velocity vector illustrates motion along a circle.

5. **Differentiability and Smoothness**:
   - A differentiable vector function has an existing and continuous derivative.
   - Smoothness requires this derivative to never be zero on any subinterval within its domain; otherwise, it results in cusps or non-smooth points.

6. **Piecewise Smoothness**: If a curve isn't smooth over the entire interval due to points where the derivative is zero, it can still be piecewise smooth by dividing into segments without such issues.

### Examples

1. **Position Vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t^2, 2at) \)**:
   - Derivative: \( (2t, 2a) \).
   - Smoothness ensured as the derivative is never zero when \( a \neq 0 \).

2. **Parametrized Parabola and Helix**:
   - For the parabola, derivatives are non-zero everywhere.
   - The helix has components with sine and cosine functions, ensuring its derivative is never zero due to a constant component.

Both examples illustrate that smooth curves have derivatives that exist and do not equate to zero anywhere in their domain. This ensures continuous paths without abrupt changes or cusps, highlighting the geometric interpretation of these vector function behaviors in calculus and physics.

The text discusses differentiation of vector functions with a focus on determining when they define smooth curves. The key points covered include:

1. **Differentiability vs. Smoothness**:
   - A vector function is differentiable if its derivative exists and is continuous.
   - Differentiability alone does not ensure the curve is smooth; additional conditions must be met.

2. **Criteria for a Smooth Curve**:
   - The first derivative of each component of the position vector, \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \), must exist and be continuous.
   - \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) should not equal zero on any open subinterval within its domain to avoid cusps or non-smooth points.

3. **Examples Analyzed**:
   - A vector function representing a parabola (\(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t^2, 2at)\)) is smooth because its derivative \((2t, 2a)\) never equals zero due to \(a\) being nonzero.
   - A helix described by components involving trigonometric functions and a linear term has a derivative that includes \(-\sin(t), \cos(t), 1\). This derivative never equals zero because of the constant 1 component, ensuring smoothness.

4. **Piecewise Smoothness**:
   - While some curves may not be entirely smooth due to points where their derivatives are zero (e.g., cusps), they can still be considered piecewise smooth if divided into segments where each is smooth.

In summary, while differentiability ensures the existence of a derivative, additional conditions must be satisfied for a vector function to define a smooth curve. The text uses examples like parabolas and helices to illustrate these concepts, highlighting that both the continuous existence of derivatives and their non-zero nature across domains are crucial for smoothness.
