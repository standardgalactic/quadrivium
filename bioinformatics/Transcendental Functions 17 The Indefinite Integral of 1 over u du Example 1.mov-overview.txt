To evaluate the definite integral \(\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{4 \cos \theta}{3 + 2 \sin \theta} \, d\theta\), two approaches are considered: \(u\)-substitution and recognizing a derivative pattern.

**Using \(u\)-Substitution:**

1. Set \( u = 3 + 2 \sin \theta \).
2. Then, \( du = 2 \cos \theta \, d\theta \), implying \( 4 \cos \theta \, d\theta = 2 \cdot 2 \cos \theta \, d\theta = 2 \, du \).

3. Change the limits of integration:
   - When \(\theta = -\pi/2\), \( u = 3 + 2 \sin(-\pi/2) = 3 - 2 = 1 \).
   - When \(\theta = \pi/2\), \( u = 3 + 2 \sin(\pi/2) = 3 + 2 = 5 \).

4. Substitute into the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{4 \cos \theta}{3 + 2 \sin \theta} \, d\theta = \int_1^5 \frac{2}{u} \, du
   \]

5. Evaluate the integral:
   \[
   2 \int_1^5 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 2 [\ln |u|]_1^5 = 2 (\ln 5 - \ln 1) = 2 \ln 5
   \]

**Recognizing the Derivative Pattern:**

1. Notice that \(3 + 2 \sin \theta\) is in the denominator and its derivative, \(2 \cos \theta\), appears in the numerator.

2. Rewrite the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{4 \cos \theta}{3 + 2 \sin \theta} \, d\theta = 2 \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{2 \cos \theta}{3 + 2 \sin \theta} \, d\theta
   \]

3. Recognize the integral as a derivative:
   - The integral of \(\frac{f'(\theta)}{f(\theta)}\) is \(\ln |f(\theta)|\).

4. Apply the formula:
   \[
   2 \left[ \ln |3 + 2 \sin \theta| \right]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}
   \]

5. Evaluate at the limits:
   - At \(\theta = \pi/2\), \(3 + 2 \sin(\pi/2) = 5\).
   - At \(\theta = -\pi/2\), \(3 + 2 \sin(-\pi/2) = 1\).

6. Result:
   \[
   2 (\ln 5 - \ln 1) = 2 \ln 5
   \]

Both methods yield the same result: \(2 \ln 5\).

The text describes a mathematical process:

1. Start with \(3 + 2\), which equals 5.
2. Calculate the natural logarithm (ln) of \(\sin(-\pi/2)\). Since \(\sin(-\pi/2) = -1\), we have \(\ln(-1)\).
3. Recognize that multiplying by \(\ln(-1)\) is equivalent to multiplying by a complex number, but for the sake of this problem, it simplifies as follows: \(5 \times (-1) = 3 - 2\), which equals 1.
4. The natural logarithm of 1 is 0 (\(\ln(1) = 0\)).
5. Finally, the expression equates to \(2 \times \ln(5)\).

The process results in the expression simplifying to \(2 \times \ln(5)\).
