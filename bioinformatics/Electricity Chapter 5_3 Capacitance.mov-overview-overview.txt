The text provides an overview of calculating capacitance for different configurations:

1. **Capacitance of an Isolated Sphere:**
   - The formula for the capacitance \( C \) of an isolated sphere is given by:
     \[
     C = 4\pi\varepsilon_0 R
     \]
   where \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space and \( R \) is the radius.

2. **Capacitors in Parallel:**
   - The total capacitance \( C_{\text{total}} \) for capacitors in parallel is:
     \[
     C_{\text{parallel}} = C_1 + C_2
     \]
   - All capacitors have the same potential difference across them.

3. **Capacitors in Series:**
   - The reciprocal of the total capacitance for capacitors in series is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{C_{\text{series}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
     \]
   - Each capacitor carries the same charge.

4. **Example Problem:**
   - For a circuit with \( C_1 = 12 \, \mu F \), \( C_2 = 5.3 \, \mu F \) in parallel, and \( C_3 = 4.5 \, \mu F \) in series:
     - Calculate the equivalent capacitance for \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \):
       \[
       C_{12} = C_1 + C_2 = 17.3 \, \mu F
       \]
     - Find the total capacitance with \( C_3 \) in series:
       \[
       \frac{1}{C_{123}} = \frac{1}{17.3 \times 10^{-6}} + \frac{1}{4.5 \times 10^{-6}}
       \]
     - The resulting total capacitance is \( C_{123} = 3.57 \, \mu F \).

This summary encapsulates the methods and calculations for determining capacitance in various scenarios as described in the text.
