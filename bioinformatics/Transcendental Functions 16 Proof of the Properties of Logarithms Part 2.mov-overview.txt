The text outlines a proof of one of the logarithm properties using calculus, specifically the exponent property: \(\ln(x^r) = r \cdot \ln(x)\). The proof employs the first derivative and Corollary 2 of the Mean Value Theorem.

1. **Derivative Analysis**: 
   - It starts by taking the derivative of \(y = \ln(x^r)\) with respect to \(x\).
   - Using chain rule, it finds that the derivative is \(\frac{r}{x}\).

2. **Substitution**:
   - By setting \(u = x^r\) and differentiating, it shows that both sides of the equation yield the same derivative: \(r \cdot x^{r-1} \cdot \frac{1}{x^r} = \frac{r}{x}\).

3. **Conclusion from Derivatives**:
   - Since both expressions have identical derivatives, they differ only by a constant \(c\). Thus, \(\ln(x^r) = r \cdot \ln(x) + c\).

4. **Evaluation at Specific Point**:
   - By evaluating the equation at \(x = 1\), it concludes that \(c = 0\) because \(\ln(1^r) = r \cdot \ln(1)\) simplifies to \(0 = 0 + c\).

5. **Final Result**:
   - Therefore, for all positive \(x\), the property holds: \(\ln(x^r) = r \cdot \ln(x)\).

6. **Scope Limitation**:
   - This proof assumes \(r\) is a rational number because it relies on previously established rules that do not yet cover irrational exponents.

Overall, the text confirms the exponent rule for logarithms using differentiation and evaluation at specific points.
