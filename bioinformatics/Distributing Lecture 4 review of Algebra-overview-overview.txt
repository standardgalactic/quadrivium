The text provides a detailed explanation of simplifying expressions involving exponents, fractional powers, and polynomial multiplication.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Exponent Addition**: When multiplying terms with the same base, add their exponents (e.g., \(a^4 \times a^3 = a^{7}\)).

2. **Fractional Exponents**: Fractional exponents like \(a^{1/4}\) represent roots (fourth root in this case). Add fractional exponents as you would whole numbers.

3. **Adding Fractions**: To add fractions such as \(4 + \frac{1}{4}\), convert to a common denominator, resulting in \(a^4 \times a^{1/4} = a^{17/4}\).

### Example Simplification:

**Expression**: \(\sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y}\)

- **Combine Radicals**: \(\sqrt{(x^3 y) \times (x^3 y)} = \sqrt{x^6 y^2}\).
- **Simplify**: 
  - \(\sqrt{x^6} = x^3\)
  - \(\sqrt{y^2} = y\)
- **Result**: \(x^3 y\) (assuming non-negative \(x, y\)).

### Polynomial Multiplication:

**Expression**: \((3x + 5) \times (2x^2 - x + 4)\)

1. **Distribute Terms**:
   - \(3x \cdot (2x^2 - x + 4)\)
   - \(5 \cdot (2x^2 - x + 4)\)

2. **Multiply Out**:
   - \(3x \cdot 2x^2 = 6x^3\)
   - \(3x \cdot (-x) = -3x^2\)
   - \(3x \cdot 4 = 12x\)
   - \(5 \cdot 2x^2 = 10x^2\)
   - \(5 \cdot (-x) = -5x\)
   - \(5 \cdot 4 = 20\)

3. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - \(6x^3\)
   - \(-3x^2 + 10x^2 = 7x^2\)
   - \(12x - 5x = 7x\)
   - Constant: \(20\)

4. **Final Result**: \(6x^3 + 7x^2 + 7x + 20\).

This summary captures the essential steps and methods for simplifying expressions with exponents, radicals, and polynomial multiplication.

The text describes methods for expanding expressions of the form \((a + b)^n\) using algebraic techniques and Pascal's Triangle. Here's a summary:

1. **Basic Expansion**: 
   - Squaring \((a + b)\) results in \(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\).
   - Cubing \((a + b)\) results in \(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\).

2. **Using Pascal's Triangle**:
   - The triangle provides coefficients for expanding binomials raised to a power.
   - Each row corresponds to the coefficients needed for a specific power \(n\).
   - For instance, \((a + b)^5\) uses the 6th row: 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1.
   - The expanded form is:
     \[
     a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5
     \]

3. **General Method**:
   - Start with the highest power of \(a\) and decrease, while increasing powers of \(b\).
   - Use coefficients from Pascal's Triangle for each term to simplify expansion.

This systematic approach aids in efficiently expanding binomials raised to various powers by providing a clear method to determine coefficients.
