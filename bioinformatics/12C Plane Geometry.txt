Now, in the previous section, we saw that if we have component form a, b, c, representing a vector v,
and we do the dot product with this vector, x minus x0, y minus y0, z minus z0, and we equal that to 0,
it represents a plane through a point P0, with x, y, z0 being those values there,
and perpendicular to a vector v, components a, b, c.
So that is the equation for a plane in free space.
What about a line in free space?
Well, this is how we get the equation for a line.
We're going to have our line, let's call this line line L,
two points on it, P0 and P, such that P0 is specific values, x0, y0, z0,
and we have any point P on that line representing x by x, y, and z0,
and we say that that line is perpendicular to a vector v in component form a, b, c.
Note the vector form in component, vector in component form with its initial point
at the origin of our free space coordinate system.
Now, it should hold that if we make P, O, P, P, 0, P into a vector,
that there's going to be some similarity between these two vectors,
and as much as they point in the same direction, we said that they were paralleled,
some lines in there from old geometry,
such that we will have vector P0, P,
it's going to equal vector v,
but some scalar times vector v.
So they point in the same direction,
so this is going to be, depending on the way I choose these two points,
it's going to be longer than vector v,
it's going to be shorter than vector v,
so if it was longer,
so it was twice as long as v,
then it was going to be two times vector v.
two times vector v.
So let's just get vector P0, P,
vector P0, P,
that is going to equal x minus x0,
y minus y0,
and z minus z0.
So that is going to equal,
this is going to equal,
t times a, t times b,
t times c,
in component form.
In other words,
we're going to have x minus x0,
is going to equal ta,
y minus y0,
is going to equal t,
that's going to equal b,
and z minus z0,
is going to equal t,
and c.
t was a c,
so we're going to have x equals,
x0 plus ta,
y is going to equal,
y0 plus t,
and z is going to equal z0 plus t with a c,
and these three are called,
the parametric equations for line L.
The parametric equations for line L,
and t can be anything,
negative infinity,
smaller than t,
smaller than infinity,
smaller than infinity.
So,
we don't have a single equation,
but we have these parametric,
or parametric equations for line L,
in free space.
Next,
we'll do an example,
so,
example of two,
to make this,
so,
an example,
we're asked to get the line,
through a point,
one, two,
negative three,
parallel to a vector,
in component form,
four, five,
and negative seven.
Well,
we remember our parametric equations,
and as much as we're going to express this,
line,
in parametric form,
it's going to be x0 plus tA,
y is going to equal y0 plus tB,
and z is going to equal z0 plus tC.
Now,
where is what?
Let's just quickly see,
this is going to be a, b, and c,
and that point is going to be x0, y0, z0.
So,
we're going to have x equals,
one plus,
four t,
and this is the way we write it,
and y is going to equal two,
and b is five,
so,
plus five t,
and z is going to equal,
negative three,
minus seven,
t,
and,
we've got to indicate what t can be,
and it can be anything on the real line.
So,
these are,
this is the parametric equation of this.
To show you an example,
that we don't need a vector and a point,
we can also have two points.
Let's call this point p1,
let's call this point p2.
Still,
we want the line through the equation for the lines,
we're going to do,
obviously,
parametric equations.
Let's get vector p1,
p2,
and that is going to equal,
five minus two,
that's three,
zero minus four,
that's negative four,
seven minus negative one,
that's eight.
So,
that is still a vector for us,
that is still our vector,
and we can make this useless first one,
that's x zero,
y zero,
and z zero,
making this still our a,
b,
and c.
So,
x is going to be x zero,
so that's going to be two plus three t,
and that's going to y is going to equal,
y zero is four,
minus four t,
and z is going to equal,
z zero,
which is going to be minus one,
and a negative one plus eight t,
plus eight t.
Now,
there's a question.
This is now the parametric equation of our line L.
I want to know,
in what spot does this line go through the x, y plane?
What spot does this line,
represented by these parametric equations,
go through the x, y plane?
Now, the x, y plane,
represents the whole plane,
in x and y,
where z equals zero.
That would be the x, y plane.
So, immediately,
we said z equal to zero.
In other words,
zero equals negative one plus eight t.
That means eight t equals one,
or t equals an eighth.
t equals an eighth.
Yeah, I should have said,
remember,
negative infinity is smaller than t,
is smaller than infinity,
but now we have t equals an eighth.
So, I can plug that in here.
That's going to be two plus three times an eighth.
And here we're going to have y equals four minus four times an eighth.
Four times four.
Okay, so that's going to equal two plus three over eight.
And that's going to equal,
I've done it before,
just check for yourself,
nineteen over eight.
And that's going to give me a y value of seven over two.
So, the point in which my line,
L,
passes through the x, y plane,
is going to equal
nineteen over eight,
over seven over two,
over zero.
That's the point that passes through the x, y plane.
Now, here we have two planes,
sort of trying to draw it in three space.
And those two planes will intersect somewhere.
And that line of intersection,
in three space,
will have an equation.
So, here I have my two planes,
the equations of the two planes,
and I want to know the equation of this line
where they intersect.
This line of intersection.
So, these planes go up forever and ever,
but I want an equation for that line.
Now, the only way,
for now,
that I can solve this,
if I turn these two into a matrix,
so what I'm going to have here,
let me do that,
I'll have the equals six on this side,
and equals four on this side.
So, I'm just taking the negative six
and the negative four to the other side.
So, I can make,
I have three unknowns
and two equations.
So, if I do a matrix of this,
an augmented matrix,
three, two, negative four, and six,
and I have one,
and negative three,
and negative two, and four,
so you can see I'm not going to get to a solution
for every value.
But, let's do Gauss elimination,
so we get to row echelon four of this.
First step,
let's put in the first row a leading one.
That will make life easier for us.
One, negative three,
negative two, and four,
and then we'll have three,
two, negative four, and six.
Good revision for us,
just to do some Gauss elimination.
One, negative three,
one,
and negative three,
negative two.
I just want to see where they have that right.
So, I've got to get rid of this three.
How can I do that?
Let's multiply the first line up
by a negative three.
So, I'm going to get negative three,
and I'm going to get nine.
We have a negative three, nine,
and we're going to get a six,
and times negative three,
we're going to get negative 12.
Let's add that to this.
I'm going to get one,
negative three,
negative two, and four.
Negative three plus three is zero.
Nine plus two is eleven.
Six and negative four is going to be a two.
And negative twelve and six
is going to be a negative six.
I'll need to change this into a leading one.
One, negative three,
negative two, and four.
We have zero.
And here, I'm going to have
eleven over,
oh, eleven over eleven,
which is going to be one.
Two over eleven,
and negative six over eleven.
So, I have leading,
I have leading ones.
Now, let's, let's just make some space.
Let's just make some space.
Or, what we can do,
I mean, this for us now is
Gauss elimination,
it's in row echelon four.
Leading one isn't underneath,
and leading one is zero.
I just have these two.
But we don't know the third equation.
We don't know,
we don't know the third equation,
so we can solve for the third unknown.
So, we're going to call
z equals us to t.
z equals us to t.
Let's read off from this line though.
We're going to have
zero x
plus one y
and it was plus
two over eleven.
z was going to equal,
well, t,
yeah, z was going to equal
negative six over eleven.
Negative six over eleven.
But we know
that
we know that
we know what the value for z is.
So, we're going to be left
with y equals
negative six over eleven
minus
two over eleven
t.
and now we've got
to solve for
we've got to solve for
x as well.
And if we read it off there,
we're going to have
x minus
three y
minus
two z
equals
four.
Well, we know what y is,
so we're going to have
x minus three
and instead of y
we're going to have
negative six over eleven
minus
two over eleven
t
minus
two
another t
because z equals t
and that's going to equal
four.
So, now I just have to solve
for x.
I multiply these up
and then what I'm going to be left with
do that on your own.
I get x equals
twenty six over eleven
plus
sixteen
over eleven
t
So, there are my parametric equations
for this
for this line.
I have for x
I have for y
and I have for z
and all I need to know is that
negative infinity
smaller than t
smaller than infinity.
There we go.
