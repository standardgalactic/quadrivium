To find the area between the x-axis and the curve defined by \( y = 6 - x - x^2 \), we first determine where this function intersects the x-axis. This occurs when \( y = 0 \):

\[ 
6 - x - x^2 = 0 
\]

Rewriting, we get:

\[ 
x^2 + x - 6 = 0 
\]

Factoring gives:

\[ 
(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0 
\]

Thus, the x-intercepts are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). These points form the limits for integration.

We set up the definite integral to find the area:

\[ 
\int_{-3}^{2} (6 - x - x^2) \, dx 
\]

The antiderivative of each term is calculated as follows:

1. The antiderivative of \( 6 \) is \( 6x \).
2. The antiderivative of \( -x \) is \( -\frac{x^2}{2} \).
3. The antiderivative of \( -x^2 \) is \( -\frac{x^3}{3} \).

Thus, the combined antiderivative is:

\[ 
6x - \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3} 
\]

We evaluate this from \(-3\) to \(2\):

1. At \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   12 - 2 - \frac{8}{3} = 10 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{22}{3}
   \]

2. At \( x = -3 \):
   \[
   -18 - \frac{9}{2} + 9 = -9 - \frac{9}{2} = -\frac{18}{2} - \frac{9}{2} = -\frac{27}{2}
   \]

Subtract the value at \( x = -3 \) from the value at \( x = 2 \):

\[
\left(\frac{22}{3}\right) - \left(-\frac{27}{2}\right)
\]

Convert to a common denominator of 6:

- \(\frac{22}{3} = \frac{44}{6}\)
- \(-\frac{27}{2} = -\frac{81}{6}\)

Calculate the difference:

\[
\frac{44}{6} + \frac{81}{6} = \frac{125}{6}
\]

Therefore, the area bounded by the x-axis and the function is \(\frac{125}{6}\).
