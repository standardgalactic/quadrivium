The text discusses calculating the electric field created by point charges and emphasizes the principle of superposition in determining the net electric field at a specific point. 

1. **Electric Field Due to a Point Charge**: 
   - The electric field (\(E\)) due to a charge \(q\) at a distance \(r\) is determined using Coulomb's law. It is given by:
     \[
     E = \frac{k |q|}{r^2}
     \]
     where \(k\) is the electrostatic constant.

2. **Superposition Principle**:
   - The net electric field due to multiple charges at a point is the vector sum of the fields produced by each charge independently.
   
3. **Example Problem**:
   - Consider four charges: \(+2q\), \(-4q\), and \(-2q\) all located at equal distances from the origin, with angles of 30 degrees relative to an axis.
   - Calculate the net electric field at the origin by summing up individual contributions:
     - Each charge contributes a vector field which can be broken down into x and y components using trigonometric functions (cosine for x-direction, sine for y-direction).
     - The direction of each component depends on whether the charge is positive or negative.

4. **Result**:
   - After decomposing the vectors and summing up their components, symmetry considerations show that certain components cancel out.
   - The net result in this scenario yields a specific value: \(6.93 \times k \times q / d^2\).

The discussion sets the stage for exploring more complex configurations like electric dipoles in subsequent lessons.
