The text discusses a method for solving differential equations, emphasizing differences from the superposition approach. The key steps include:

1. **Complementary Solution**: Solve the homogeneous equation to find the complementary solution using an auxiliary equation. For \( y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0 \), the solutions are \( c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^{-2x} \).

2. **Annihilating Operator**: Use the annihilator method to transform the non-homogeneous part into a homogeneous equation. The operator \( d^3 \) is applied to both sides, leading back to a homogeneous form.

3. **Auxiliary Equation Revisited**: Solve the new auxiliary equation \( m^3 + 3m^2 + 2m = 0 \), yielding roots that inform the solution structure: \( c_1 + c_2 x + c_3 x^2 + c_4 e^{-x} + c_5 e^{-2x} \).

4. **Particular Solution**: Recognize the particular solution is embedded in the form derived from the annihilator method, differentiating it from previous methods by not altering existing complementary terms.

5. **Solving for Coefficients**: Substitute back into the original equation to solve for coefficients \( a, b, c \), ensuring all parts of the polynomial match the non-homogeneous term \( 4x^2 \).

The fundamental difference highlighted is treating the complementary solution as part of the total solution and directly solving for the particular part using the annihilator approach.
