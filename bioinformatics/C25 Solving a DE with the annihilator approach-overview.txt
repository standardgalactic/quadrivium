The text discusses a method for solving differential equations, emphasizing differences from the superposition approach. The key steps include:

1. **Complementary Solution**: Solve the homogeneous equation to find the complementary solution using an auxiliary equation. For \( y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0 \), the solutions are \( c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^{-2x} \).

2. **Annihilating Operator**: Use the annihilator method to transform the non-homogeneous part into a homogeneous equation. The operator \( d^3 \) is applied to both sides, leading back to a homogeneous form.

3. **Auxiliary Equation Revisited**: Solve the new auxiliary equation \( m^3 + 3m^2 + 2m = 0 \), yielding roots that inform the solution structure: \( c_1 + c_2 x + c_3 x^2 + c_4 e^{-x} + c_5 e^{-2x} \).

4. **Particular Solution**: Recognize the particular solution is embedded in the form derived from the annihilator method, differentiating it from previous methods by not altering existing complementary terms.

5. **Solving for Coefficients**: Substitute back into the original equation to solve for coefficients \( a, b, c \), ensuring all parts of the polynomial match the non-homogeneous term \( 4x^2 \).

The fundamental difference highlighted is treating the complementary solution as part of the total solution and directly solving for the particular part using the annihilator approach.

The text describes a differential equations problem-solving method that differs from the superposition approach previously discussed. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Problem Setup**: The task involves solving a non-homogeneous differential equation, with an emphasis on distinguishing between complementary and particular solutions.

2. **Complementary Solution**:
   - First, solve the homogeneous version of the equation: \( y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0 \).
   - Use the auxiliary equation \( m^2 + 3m + 2 = 0 \), which factors to give roots \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -2 \).
   - The complementary solution is given by: \( y_c = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^{-2x} \).

3. **Particular Solution**:
   - To find the particular solution, consider an annihilating operator that simplifies the non-homogeneous equation to a homogeneous form.
   - Apply the differential operator \( d^3 \) to both sides of the equation involving terms like \( 4x^2 + 3y' + 2y \).
   - This transforms the problem into solving another homogeneous equation.

4. **Differentiating from Superposition**:
   - Unlike the superposition method, where you treat complementary and particular solutions separately, here the complementary part is already considered as part of the whole solution.
   - The focus shifts to identifying the particular solution directly within the context of the total solution \( y \).

5. **Solving for Coefficients**:
   - Derive equations based on matching coefficients from both sides of the transformed equation.
   - Solve these equations to find specific values for constants in the particular solution.

6. **Final Solution**:
   - Combine the complementary and particular solutions into a single expression: \( y = 7 - 6x + 2x^2 + c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^{-2x} \).

The method emphasizes integrating both parts of the solution within a unified framework, using an annihilating operator to simplify the process.
