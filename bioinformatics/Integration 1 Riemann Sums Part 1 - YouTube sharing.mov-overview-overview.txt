The text introduces the concept of integration through the method of calculating areas under curves using Riemann sums, specifically focusing on estimating the area beneath the function \( y = 1 - x^2 \) within the first quadrant. The region is bounded by the y-axis (\(x=0\)), the x-axis (\(y=0\)), and the line \(x=1\).

To approximate this area, the interval from \(a=0\) to \(b=1\) is divided into \(n=2\) equal parts, each with a width of 0.5. Using left endpoints for the heights, the first rectangle has a height of 1 (evaluated at \(x=0\)), resulting in an area of 0.5. The second rectangle's height is \(\frac{3}{4}\) (evaluated at \(x=0.5\)), giving it an area of \(\frac{3}{8}\). Summing these areas yields an estimated total area of \(\frac{7}{8}\), which overestimates the true area under the curve.

This method, known as "left hand Riemann sums" or "upper sums," illustrates that increasing the number of rectangles and decreasing their width improves accuracy in estimating integrals. The text underscores this technique's importance in integration, with further exploration promised later.
