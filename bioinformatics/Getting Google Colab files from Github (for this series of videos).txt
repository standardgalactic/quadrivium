and so we have this typing karaoke i talk you see me type and then you type yourself but you can also
download these notebooks i'm going to put them on github and in this video i'm going to show you how
you can download them and then drag them onto your google drive so you have those files as well now
you can download them as a zip folder as a zip file but you can also use git if you want to know
more about git perhaps just let me know and i can make a video about that but i'm going to show you
the easy way and that's just to download from github that's a online repository where i'm putting
all these files and you can just download them onto your own system and then drag them onto your google
drive and this is what a github repository looks like so if you follow the link you'll get to this
page there you see my name that's my github little site and then it's python and then all the dashes
in between for healthcare statistics and then coursera and you'll see all the files and the folder
structure as you might have noticed i have on my google drive so we've got the data folder
the images folder we've got one week week one data week two the first thing is descriptive statistics so
as i make these videos i'll add all these file files here so how do you get hold of them well if
you know how to use git and how to do a git clone how to clone a repository that's obviously fantastic
if you want a video on that perhaps i'll make one the easiest way for you to do it now if you don't
know how to do git is you'll see a little green button here which is clone or download if you know how to
clone a git repository and you have git installed of course you can just copy this git repository there
and and in a terminal say git clone etc but you can also just download the zip folder so let's download
that i've got an empty drive here an external ssd and i'm going to save it there and let's show that
folder so it's a zip folder there's various ways to to uncompress a zip folder depending with whether you
are on linux windows or mac os here i'm just going to right click on it and say extract all
extract and it's all there if i click it open you see everything is there now what you could do is
very simply there's the google drive now under my drive you can create a new folder let's call this one
github you've got to call it something that's more appropriate for you i'm going to right click on it
change the color let's make it light blue there and if i double click on that that opens up and it
says just drop your files here so let's go back here i can very simply let's go down i'm just going
to select all of them and i'm just going to drag them right there and it's going to upload so that
same folder structure is there everything is there but when you log in if you did this on your own
google drive and you logged in of course when you cd into that directory to get to the csv files
you'll have to follow the naming convention that you gave up here to your folder structure so they'll
be slightly different for you remember mine is in my drive then i have a coursera folder here
understanding clinical research so i have to type all of those things in when i cd into this data folder
which is where all the all the csv files are there you go they're all there so i have to use that
whole folder structure to get access to these files and you'll have to do exactly the same thing
so that's how you can get access to the same files and notebooks the collab notebooks that i'm using
in case you want to install all of that onto your own drive if you do download the zip every time i
change something and i upload it you'll have to just redo all of this um as you download the new zip
folder that's going to look different so perhaps it's much easier if you work off of a git repository
and if you can clone a git repository that'll help you a lot otherwise we'll also have a video
i think later on how you can just get access to these files themselves
it's you
it really does
it really makes things think really
that we fit in there
when you're supposed to do everything
you
i know
you
so
oh
i know
grave
it
