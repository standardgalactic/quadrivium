The text explains how to determine the dimension of the null space (nullity) of a matrix using the Rank-Nullity Theorem. Here's a summary of the key points:

### Key Concepts

1. **Rank-Nullity Theorem**:
   - For an \( m \times n \) matrix \( A \), the theorem states:
     \[
     \text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n
     \]
   - Here, \(\text{rank}(A)\) is the number of linearly independent rows or columns, and \(\text{nullity}(A)\) is the dimension of the null space.

2. **Null Space**:
   - The null space consists of all vectors \( x \) that satisfy \( Ax = 0 \).
   - If the nullity is zero, the only solution to \( Ax = 0 \) is the trivial solution \( x = 0 \).

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - For matrix \( A \):
     \[
     A = \begin{bmatrix} 
     1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
     2 & 1 & 1 \\ 
     3 & 1 & 4 
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The rank is determined to be 3 (all columns are linearly independent).
   - With \( n = 3 \) columns, applying the theorem:
     \[
     3 + \text{nullity}(A) = 3
     \]
   - Solving gives \(\text{nullity}(A) = 0\).

4. **Subspace Verification**:
   - To prove the null space is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^n \), it must contain the zero vector, and be closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
   - The zero vector satisfies \( Ax = 0 \).
   - If \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are in the null space, then \( A(x_1 + x_2) = Ax_1 + Ax_2 = 0 + 0 = 0 \), so \( x_1 + x_2 \) is also in the null space.
   - For any scalar \( c \), if \( x \) is in the null space, then \( A(cx) = c(Ax) = c \cdot 0 = 0 \), so \( cx \) is also in the null space.

These concepts illustrate how linear algebra tools like the Rank-Nullity Theorem help analyze matrix properties and solve linear systems.

The text discusses how the null space of a matrix \( A \) is a vector space by demonstrating two key properties: closure under addition and scalar multiplication. It shows that if vectors \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are in the null space, then their sum \( x_1 + x_2 \) is also in the null space because:

\[ 
A(x_1 + x_2) = Ax_1 + Ax_2 = 0 + 0 = 0 
\]

Similarly, for any vector \( x \) in the null space and scalar \( c \), the product \( cx \) remains in the null space as:

\[ 
A(cx) = c(Ax) = c \cdot 0 = 0 
\]

These properties, along with containing the zero vector, confirm that the null space meets all criteria to be a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^n \), thus forming a vector space. The text also notes the convenience of using computational tools like Python to verify these mathematical properties efficiently compared to traditional methods.
