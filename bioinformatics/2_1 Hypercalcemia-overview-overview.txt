The text provides an overview of hypercalcemia's causes, categorized by bone resorption, gastrointestinal (GIT) calcium absorption, and miscellaneous factors. Hypercalcemia occurs when calcium entry into circulation from sources like the GIT or bone exceeds urinary excretion or deposition in bone.

**Primary Causes**: 
- **Primary Hyperparathyroidism**: This is a leading cause where elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels lead to increased bone resorption and calcium absorption in the GIT.
- **Secondary/Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism**: These are linked with renal failure. Chronic kidney disease can eventually cause hypercalcemia when PTH becomes autonomous.

**Bone Resorption**:
- Malignancies such as solid tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas may cause bone resorption through direct invasion or cytokine release.
- Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in non-metastatic cancers and increased calcitriol levels in some lymphomas contribute to hypercalcemia.
- Other causes include thyrotoxicosis, immobilization, diseases like Pagetâ€™s disease, drugs such as tamoxifen, and hypervitaminosis A.

**Calcium Absorption in the GIT**:
- Active calcium absorption is regulated by vitamin D metabolites; passive absorption can occur with large intakes.
- Hypercalcemia from increased calcium intake usually requires renal impairment.
- Chronic kidney disease leads to hyperphosphatemia and decreased calcitriol production, causing hypocalcemia unless treated with oral calcium supplements or calcitriol.

**Miscellaneous Causes**:
- These include lithium use, thiazide diuretics, pheochromocytoma, adrenal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, theophylline toxicity, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, and congenital lactase deficiency.

The text emphasizes that primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer are major contributors to hypercalcemia. It highlights how diseases affect calcium balance through mechanisms involving the parathyroid glands, bones, kidneys, and GIT.
