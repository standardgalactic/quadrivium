The text provides an overview of how mathematical models and limits can be applied in life sciences. It emphasizes that understanding limits makes it easier to address practical problems without needing overly realistic models.

1. **Introduction**: The author starts by summarizing the previously covered content on limits, explaining their relevance to real-world applications in life sciences.

2. **Mathematical Model Example**:
   - A model is presented with an equation representing a population size over time.
   - Key questions include determining initial population size, long-term behavior, and yearly changes in population.
   - Calculations demonstrate how limits can predict that the population will stabilize at 60,000 people and show expected growth during specific years.

3. **Application to Medical Context**:
   - Another model is introduced to analyze waiting times for patients on a surgical list.
   - Using limit laws, it predicts that waiting times will stabilize around 5.6 months.

4. **Conclusion**: The text concludes by highlighting the utility of mathematical models and limits in planning and decision-making processes within life sciences, particularly in managing population growth and healthcare logistics.
