The text provides an overview of how mathematical models and limits can be applied in life sciences. It emphasizes that understanding limits makes it easier to address practical problems without needing overly realistic models.

1. **Introduction**: The author starts by summarizing the previously covered content on limits, explaining their relevance to real-world applications in life sciences.

2. **Mathematical Model Example**:
   - A model is presented with an equation representing a population size over time.
   - Key questions include determining initial population size, long-term behavior, and yearly changes in population.
   - Calculations demonstrate how limits can predict that the population will stabilize at 60,000 people and show expected growth during specific years.

3. **Application to Medical Context**:
   - Another model is introduced to analyze waiting times for patients on a surgical list.
   - Using limit laws, it predicts that waiting times will stabilize around 5.6 months.

4. **Conclusion**: The text concludes by highlighting the utility of mathematical models and limits in planning and decision-making processes within life sciences, particularly in managing population growth and healthcare logistics.

The text provides an overview of applying mathematical limits and models in life sciences contexts. It emphasizes that while these models aren't always realistic, they offer meaningful insights into various scenarios.

1. **Population Modeling:** A model is presented where \( p(t) = \frac{35t}{t^2 + 9} - \frac{45}{t + 1} + 6t \), with \( p \) representing the population in thousands and \( t \) as time in years. Initially, at \( t = 0 \), the population is calculated to be 15,000 people. Using limits, it's determined that as time approaches infinity, the population stabilizes at about 60,000 people.

2. **Yearly Population Change:** To find out the change during a specific year (e.g., from year 2 to year 3), calculations are performed by evaluating \( p(3) - p(2) \). This approach helps in planning for changes such as resource allocation or infrastructure adjustments.

3. **Medical Waiting List Analysis:** A model involving arctangent is used to predict the length of a patient waiting list over time, stabilizing at approximately 5.6 months. Understanding this limit allows healthcare planners to set expectations and potentially adjust strategies if the wait times are deemed too long.

The text highlights how mathematical models and limits can be practically applied in life sciences to make informed decisions and plans.
