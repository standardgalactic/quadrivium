The text describes how to calculate the electric potential at a point due to different configurations of line charges: a semicircular arc and a uniformly charged straight wire.

1. **Electric Potential from a Semicircular Line Charge:**
   - Consider a semicircular line charge with radius \( R \). The goal is to find the electric potential at a point a distance \( r \) away.
   - A differential element of charge, \( dQ \), on this arc can be expressed in terms of the linear charge density (\(\lambda\)) and a small differential angle \( d\theta \).
   - Using integration over the semicircular arc, it is shown that the potential at distance \( r \) from such a configuration simplifies to the same form as if all the charge were concentrated at a single point: \( V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} \), where \( q \) is the total charge on the arc.

2. **Electric Potential from a Uniformly Charged Straight Wire:**
   - For a uniformly charged straight wire of length \( L \), with one end at \( x = 0 \), we calculate the potential at point \( P \) which is located 1 meter away from the wire's endpoint.
   - The setup involves calculating the potential due to differential elements \( dq \) along the wire, where \( dq = \lambda dx \).
   - The distance \( r \) from a differential element on the wire to point \( P \) is given by \( x + 1 \).
   - Integrating over the length of the wire gives the potential at \( P \), which involves evaluating an integral in terms of natural logarithms.

The examples illustrate how line charge configurations can be analyzed using integrals, and they demonstrate the application of calculus to find electric potentials for different geometries.
