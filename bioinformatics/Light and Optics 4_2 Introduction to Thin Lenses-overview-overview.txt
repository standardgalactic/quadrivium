The text provides detailed solutions to various optical problems involving lenses, with an emphasis on determining image distance (\(s_i\)) and magnification (m) for converging (convex) and diverging (concave) lenses using specific examples:

1. **First Problem - Converging Lens:**
   - Focal length \(f = 12 \text{ cm}\), object distance \(s_0 = 20 \text{ cm}\).
   - Image is real, inverted with a distance of \(s_i = 30 \text{ cm}\) and image height \(y_i = -6 \text{ cm}\).

2. **Second Problem - Converging Lens:**
   - Focal length \(f = 7.5 \text{ cm}\), object distance \(s_0 = 5 \text{ cm}\).
   - Image is virtual, upright, and enlarged with an image distance of \(s_i = -15 \text{ cm}\).

3. **Third Problem - Diverging Lens:**
   - Focal length \(f = -18 \text{ cm}\), object distance \(s_0 = 27 \text{ cm}\).
   - Image is virtual, upright, and diminished with an image distance of \(s_i = -10.8 \text{ cm}\).

4. **Additional Problem - Converging Lens Placement:**
   - Focal length \(f = 20 \text{ cm}\), lens placed 30 cm from a screen.
   - Object should be placed at \(s_0 = 43.5 \text{ cm}\) to form an inverted real image on the screen.

The text also includes an example of determining object and image positions for a converging lens that projects a four times magnified image onto a screen 10 meters away, solving to find:

- Object distance \(s_0 = 3.33 \text{ m}\), image distance \(s_i = 6.67 \text{ m}\).
- Focal length is calculated using these distances.

Additionally, it presents a mathematical relationship involving focal length and provides a straightforward calculation leading to \(F = \frac{8}{5} \text{ cm}\).

Overall, the text emphasizes understanding lens properties and relationships between object distance, image distance, and focal length to predict the nature and orientation of images formed by lenses.
