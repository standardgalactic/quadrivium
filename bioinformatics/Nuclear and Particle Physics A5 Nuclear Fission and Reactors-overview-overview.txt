The provided text outlines calculations and concepts related to operating nuclear power plants, focusing on two main scenarios: a 300 MW power plant with uranium-235 fuel and a 5600 MW power plant requiring efficient cooling mechanisms. Here is a summary of each part:

### Part 1: 300 MW Power Plant Using Uranium-235

1. **Energy Production Calculation**: 
   - The plant produces \(3.0 \times 10^9\) watts continuously.
   - Yearly energy output is calculated as \(9.46 \times 10^{16}\) joules.

2. **Energy per Fission Reaction**:
   - Each uranium-235 fission releases 200 MeV, with only 25% (50 MeV or \(8 \times 10^{-14}\) joules) converted to electricity.

3. **Number of Reactions Needed**:
   - The total number of required reactions per year is approximately \(1.18 \times 10^{30}\).

4. **Mass of Uranium-235**:
   - Using Avogadro's number and the molar mass, the necessary uranium-235 mass is calculated to be about 461,000 kg/year.

5. **Reactor Operations**:
   - Enriched uranium (around 3% U-235) is used.
   - Water serves as a moderator for neutron management.
   - Control rods regulate fission reactions to maintain safety and prevent meltdowns.

6. **Pressurized Water Reactor**:
   - Heat from fission is converted into steam, driving turbines to generate electricity, with control mechanisms ensuring safe operation.

### Part 2: Cooling Requirements for a 5600 MW Power Plant

1. **Cooling Process Calculation**:
   - The plant uses water entering at 216°C and exiting at 275°C.
   - Specific heat capacity of water is approximately 4,420 J/kg·K over this temperature range.

2. **Mass Flow Rate Determination**:
   - Using the formula \( P = m \cdot C \cdot \Delta T \), where power is 5600 MW, mass flow rate (\(m/t\)) is calculated to be around 21,000 kg/s.
   - This equates to approximately 21 tons of water per second needed for cooling.

3. **Importance of Cooling**:
   - Effective cooling is critical to prevent reactor core meltdowns, as illustrated by past incidents like those in Japan when cooling systems failed.

Overall, the text discusses both the energy production from nuclear fission and the essential safety measures required for operating large-scale power plants efficiently and safely.
