Thyroid storm is a critical endocrine emergency affecting nearly 1 in 10 pregnant patients with hyperthyroidism. It commonly occurs in those with Graves' disease but may also arise de novo during pregnancy. The condition can be identified by symptoms like fever, altered mental state, seizures, nausea, diarrhea, and cardiac arrhythmias, often triggered by surgery, labor, or more commonly, infections.

Immediate management is crucial to prevent severe outcomes such as cardiogenic failure, shock, and coma. Initial treatment includes supportive therapies like supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and electrolyte replacement. Antibiotics should be administered promptly, and an obstetrician must evaluate the fetus.

Pharmacologic interventions involve thionamides, IV beta blockers (e.g., esmolol), dexamethasone, and benzodiazepines for agitation. Additionally, a thorough investigation for any underlying infection is essential to address all possible triggers of thyroid storm.
