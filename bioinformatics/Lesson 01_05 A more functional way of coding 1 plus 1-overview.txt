The text provides an introduction to using basic arithmetic operations and functions in Julia, demonstrating both operator-based and function-based calculations. It explains that in Julia, operators like plus (`+`), minus (`-`), multiply (`*`), divide (`/`), and power (`^`) can also be used as functions. For example, `plus(2, 2)` adds two numbers together.

The text highlights the importance of understanding data types in Julia, showing how integers and floating-point numbers are represented (e.g., `3` is an `int64`, while `3.0` is a `float64`). It further introduces the concept of functions, explaining how they take arguments and return results, comparing it to mathematical functions.

The use of fractions is discussed by illustrating division that maintains fractional form with double slashes (`//`). For instance, `3 // 4` retains the fraction as `3/4`, and Julia can simplify fractions automatically (e.g., `6 // 9` simplifies to `2 // 3`).

Additionally, the text demonstrates how to extract the numerator and denominator of a fraction using keywords like `numerator` and `denominator`. It also shows how to calculate both quotient and remainder in division operations with functions such as `rem()` for remainder and `divrem()` for both.

Finally, it touches on formatting code and documentation using Markdown and LaTeX-like syntax within Julia environments (Jupyter Notebooks), although this part is less focused than the computational aspects.

The text provides an introduction to using operators and functions in Julia for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It explains that these operators can also be used as functions within the language.

Key points include:

1. **Data Types**: The `type of` command is demonstrated, showing how numbers like `3` (an int64 integer) and `3.0` (a 64-bit floating-point value) are represented in Julia.

2. **Operators as Functions**: Operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^` can functionally add, subtract, multiply, divide, or raise to a power, respectively. For example, the `plus` function can be used with arguments separated by commas: `plus(2, 2)` returns `4`.

3. **Fractions**: Julia maintains fractions using double slashes (`//`). The numerator and denominator of a fraction can be accessed via the functions `num()` and `denom()`, respectively.

4. **Simplification**: Julia can simplify fractions automatically (e.g., `6//9` simplifies to `2//3`).

5. **Division Remainder**: The remainder of division is calculated using the `rem()` function, while both quotient and remainder are obtained using `divrem()`.

The section also touches on markdown usage for documentation and LaTeX-style notation for rendering mathematical expressions within text documents. Lastly, it foreshadows future discussions on data types and associations in Julia.
