Now we're going to continue looking at series and we're going to consider series up till now. I mean our series as k goes to infinity has always remained positive above or positive value except when we looked at alternating series but as I've indicated here it just alternates to plus one negative one plus one negative one one one one one stays the same but what if there are many areas under the y equals zero axis if I can
call it like that. And what we're going to do we're going to just look at the absolute value. So if I take k equals one to infinity of the absolute value of negative one to the power of k plus one what happens there? Well the absolute value of that will just be one. This is going to be one to the power of k plus one.
Okay and what we're going to say not necessarily in this instance let me wipe this out let's call this the a of k. A of k if this converges then the original series the original series without these will also converge and that is called absolutely convergent.
The other way around does not work. The other way around does not work. The other way around does not work. If this diverges if the absolute value diverges you don't know if the original series converges or diverges and then it becomes what we call conditionally convergent if it does converge.
Okay so this converges. Okay so this converges you know that the original series converges. It's called absolutely converges. It absolutely converges. Now let's look at an example. Let's just look at an example. Which one shall we use? Let's just use. Let's just use over 2k. Over 2k.
Okay now. What do we take now. What do we take as the a. This sequence. What do we take as that. Well we never if we take this the actual value of this denominator it is just 1. So it's unlike a little bit just for practical purposes unlike the alternating series test. We take this whole thing. Negative 1.
So k plus 1. K plus 1. 2k. We take that absolute value of this. Now we just see if that converges or diverges or diverges what. How can I rewrite this.
to the power of 1 million and 1 still stays 1.
So what I'm looking at here is k equals 1 to infinity of 1 over 2 to the power of k.
Now k is always positive because it goes from 1 to infinity, so that's good as it stands
there.
This can be rewritten as, I can do that to the power of k as well, so I can rewrite this
as a half to the power of k, and what do I have now?
I have the geometric series.
A is 1, r is a half, so the absolute value of r equals a half, and that is less than
1, so I'm in within my radius of convergence for a geometric series.
In other words, this absolute value is going to converge.
That means the original series that I'm looking at is absolutely convergent, and it will converge
as well.
Okay, now let's use another example.
I have k equals 1 to infinity of negative 1, k plus 1, divided by k, divided by k.
Now we have done this before, and we have indeed shown that this series converges.
How do we do that?
This is the alternating series.
What do I have to do for the alternating series?
Well, my ak in this instance is going to be 1 over k.
First of all, the limit as k goes to infinity of 1 over k is 1 over infinity, which is 0, and
now I just need to show that each subsequent one is smaller, so I'm going to do the ak plus
1 over k, that is going to be 1 over k plus 1, oops, k plus 1 over 1 over k, and that is going
equal to equal k over k over k plus 1, is that correct, and that equals, am I on the right track here, am I on the right track here,
with this, um, 1 over k, yeah, sorry, and now I have k and I have k plus 1.
So my denominator is larger than my numerator, in other words, this is always going to be less than 1.
So I've shown that this converges, indeed, to 0, and each subsequent, um, element is smaller than the previous one, in other words, I can now say that this series converges.
I know that this converges, but let's do the absolute value of this.
Let's do the absolute value of this.
What's going to happen here?
Okay, so that is going to give me the sum of k equals 1 to infinity of, of 1 over k, because the absolute value of the numerator is always going to be 1,
and then I have k in the denominator, always positive, so I don't need the absolute value of signs, and what is that?
That is the harmonic series, and what happens to the harmonic series?
It diverges.
It diverges.
Okay, so I can't absolutely now say that this original series diverges as well, because, indeed, I have just shown that it does, indeed, converge.
It does, indeed, converge.
So this becomes conditionally convergent.
This is a conditionally convergent series by this absolute value test.
If it was convergent, it's absolutely convergent.
The original series converges.
If it's divergent, we don't know.
We still have to do other tests then to see if it turns out to be convergent, as we've done here, using this alternating series test.
I showed that it is convergent, so, indeed, this was conditionally convergent, because the absolute value, the series of the absolute value of A of K diverged.
Now, for a beautiful example that brings together a lot of what we have learned about convergence tests.
I want to know whether the following series sequence of partial sums is convergent.
Sine of K divided by K cubed.
Now, let's just look.
K is always going to be positive, because it starts at 1 and goes to infinity.
As it goes from 1 to 3, 1 to 3, it is going to go, the numerator is going to go positive and negative, and as much as the sign of any value is in a range of negative 1 to 1.
The denominator, on the denominator, on the other hand, is always going to be positive, because it's cubed, but K is always positive.
So, I have a numerator that will have pluses and minuses, the denominator always positive, so my answers, my partial sums are going to be, or let me say,
if I just write these elements out, they're going to be positives and negatives, positive and negative, but it's not positive 1, negative 1, positive 1, negative 1.
They're going to be somewhere in between.
Okay, so this is not an alternating series.
If it's not an alternating series, and there are areas that are going to be under the zero mark, there are going to be negative,
I have nothing else to do, but to do the absolute value test.
Now, let's look at what the absolute value of the sine of K is, divided by K cubed.
Well, that's going to be the absolute value of the sine of K, divided by K cubed, because this K is now always going to be positive.
Now, this is always going to be less than or equal to 1 over K cubed, because this is just going to oscillate between 0 and 1, 0 and 1, 0 and 1.
It's never going to be more than 1.
So, this will always be less than that.
Now, what test do you think I can use?
Well, the only one that comes to mind is the comparative test.
And this is, we have the 0 is a K, K is this and b K.
And if I make this my b K, and I can show that b K is convergent, then obviously 8 K has also got to be convergent.
And we know what this is, 1 over K cubed, we know what this is.
It's a P series, if you remember, to infinity of 1 over K, 3.
And this is a P series, and as much as the P series with P equals 3.
And 3 is more than 1.
Remember, 1 was the modding series.
Anything more than 1 becomes a P series of.
This is a P series of 3, and we know that that is convergent.
We know that that is convergent.
So, if this is convergent, by the comparison test, this must also be convergent.
In other words, with our absolute value test being convergent, that means this series is absolutely convergent.
And the sign of P without these, that series is also convergent.
So, I had to bring together a lot of my previous knowledge to show that this series is indeed convergent.
And in actual fact, it's absolutely convergent.
