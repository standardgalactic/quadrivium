The provided text outlines a systematic approach for solving a third-order linear homogeneous differential equation. Here's a summary of the key steps:

1. **Identify the Differential Equation**: Recognize that you're dealing with a third-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.

2. **Formulate the Auxiliary Equation**: Convert the differential equation into an algebraic form known as the auxiliary equation, which is \( m^3 + 3m^2 - 4 = 0 \).

3. **Find the Roots of the Polynomial**:
   - Determine one root by inspection; substituting \( m = 1 \) shows it's a root.
   - Use polynomial long division to factor out \( (m-1) \), simplifying the equation to \( m^2 + 4m + 4 = 0 \).
   - Further factor this quadratic as \( (m+2)^2 = 0 \).

4. **Identify All Roots**: The roots are \( m_1 = 1 \), and a repeated root \( m_2 = m_3 = -2 \).

5. **Construct the General Solution**:
   - Use the roots to create solutions: for \( m_1 = 1 \), the solution is \( c_1 e^x \); for the repeated root \( m_2 = m_3 = -2 \), use \( c_2 e^{-2x} \) and \( c_3 x e^{-2x} \).

6. **Combine Solutions**: Formulate the general solution as a linear combination of these solutions:
   \[
   y(x) = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-2x} + c_3 x e^{-2x}
   \]

The text highlights the importance of recognizing polynomial patterns, simplifying equations through techniques like long division, and constructing solutions based on identified roots.
