The lecture provides an introduction to basic statistics using a set of 22 integer values from column B, assumed to be results from a medical test. The focus is on calculating three measures: mean, median, and mode, which serve as single representative values for the data set.

1. **Mean**: Also known as the average, it is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by their count. In the example provided (values 2, 4, and 6), the mean is 4. The process involves using spreadsheet functions to easily compute this value across a range of data.

2. **Median**: This is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. For an even number of values, like the 22 given, it's the average of the two central numbers. Median provides a better measure when dealing with outliers, as illustrated by changing one value from 16 to much higher figures (30 and then 100), which significantly affects the mean but not the median.

3. **Mode**: This is the most frequently occurring value in the data set. In the example provided, 16 appears more often than any other number and thus represents the mode.

The lecture highlights that while all three measures offer insights into the data's central tendency, they each serve different purposes depending on the contextâ€”particularly when outliers are present. The discussion also touches upon software compatibility with functions across different versions of spreadsheet applications.
