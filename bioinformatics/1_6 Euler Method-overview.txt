To solve the problem using Euler's method, we need to approximate the solution to a differential equation with an initial condition. In this case, you're approximating the value at \( x = 2 \) given some initial conditions and step size.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what was done:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - You started at \( (x_0, y_0) = (1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \).

2. **Step Size**:
   - The step size \( h = 0.5 \).

3. **Euler's Method Formula**:
   - \( y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n) \)
   - Here, \( f(x, y) = \frac{x^3}{y} \).

4. **Calculations**:

   - **Step 0**: 
     - \( x_0 = 1 \), \( y_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
     - \( a_0 = f(x_0, y_0) = \frac{1^3}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \sqrt{2} \).

   - **Step 1**:
     - \( x_1 = x_0 + h = 1.5 \).
     - \( y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot a_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{2} \).
     - Simplifying, \( y_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

   - **Calculate \( a_1 \)**:
     - \( a_1 = f(x_1, y_1) = \frac{(1.5)^3}{y_1} = \frac{3.375}{\frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \frac{3.375 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \).
     - Simplifying further, \( a_1 = \frac{27\sqrt{2}}{16} \).

   - **Step 2**:
     - \( x_2 = x_1 + h = 2 \).
     - \( y_2 = y_1 + h \cdot a_1 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + 0.5 \cdot \frac{27\sqrt{2}}{16} \).
     - Simplifying, \( y_2 = \frac{59\sqrt{2}}{32} \).

5. **Approximate Value**:
   - The approximate value at \( x = 2 \) is \( y_2 = \frac{59\sqrt{2}}{32} \approx 2.607 \).

6. **True Value**:
   - Using the exact solution, you found the true value to be approximately \( 2.8 \).

This demonstrates how Euler's method can provide an approximation to a differential equation's solution, with some error compared to the exact solution.

The text provides an explanation of using Euler's method for estimating solutions to differential equations when separation of variables isn't possible. The speaker estimates a value at 2.6 using Euler's number and a step size (\( h \)) of 0.5, while the actual answer is 2.8. They note that their estimation is reasonable but could be improved with smaller \( h \) values (e.g., 0.25 or 0.125). The method involves moving across an interval (\( \Delta x \)) and estimating vertical movement (\( \Delta y \)) using the slope at a point, repeating this process to progress through points.

The speaker explains that if the curve's second derivative is positive (concave up), Euler's method tends to underestimate; if negative (concave down), it overestimates. They demonstrate how practical differential equations relate to real-world phenomena like radioactive decay or biological growth and emphasize the importance of using precise decimal places in calculations for accuracy. Finally, they recap that separable first-order differential equations were previously solved, and Euler's method offers a way to estimate solutions otherwise challenging to obtain directly.
