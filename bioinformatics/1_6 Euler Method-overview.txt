To solve the problem using Euler's method, we need to approximate the solution to a differential equation with an initial condition. In this case, you're approximating the value at \( x = 2 \) given some initial conditions and step size.

Here’s a breakdown of what was done:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - You started at \( (x_0, y_0) = (1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \).

2. **Step Size**:
   - The step size \( h = 0.5 \).

3. **Euler's Method Formula**:
   - \( y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n) \)
   - Here, \( f(x, y) = \frac{x^3}{y} \).

4. **Calculations**:

   - **Step 0**: 
     - \( x_0 = 1 \), \( y_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
     - \( a_0 = f(x_0, y_0) = \frac{1^3}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \sqrt{2} \).

   - **Step 1**:
     - \( x_1 = x_0 + h = 1.5 \).
     - \( y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot a_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{2} \).
     - Simplifying, \( y_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

   - **Calculate \( a_1 \)**:
     - \( a_1 = f(x_1, y_1) = \frac{(1.5)^3}{y_1} = \frac{3.375}{\frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \frac{3.375 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \).
     - Simplifying further, \( a_1 = \frac{27\sqrt{2}}{16} \).

   - **Step 2**:
     - \( x_2 = x_1 + h = 2 \).
     - \( y_2 = y_1 + h \cdot a_1 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + 0.5 \cdot \frac{27\sqrt{2}}{16} \).
     - Simplifying, \( y_2 = \frac{59\sqrt{2}}{32} \).

5. **Approximate Value**:
   - The approximate value at \( x = 2 \) is \( y_2 = \frac{59\sqrt{2}}{32} \approx 2.607 \).

6. **True Value**:
   - Using the exact solution, you found the true value to be approximately \( 2.8 \).

This demonstrates how Euler's method can provide an approximation to a differential equation's solution, with some error compared to the exact solution.

The text provides an explanation of using Euler's method for estimating solutions to differential equations when separation of variables isn't possible. The speaker estimates a value at 2.6 using Euler's number and a step size (\( h \)) of 0.5, while the actual answer is 2.8. They note that their estimation is reasonable but could be improved with smaller \( h \) values (e.g., 0.25 or 0.125). The method involves moving across an interval (\( \Delta x \)) and estimating vertical movement (\( \Delta y \)) using the slope at a point, repeating this process to progress through points.

The speaker explains that if the curve's second derivative is positive (concave up), Euler's method tends to underestimate; if negative (concave down), it overestimates. They demonstrate how practical differential equations relate to real-world phenomena like radioactive decay or biological growth and emphasize the importance of using precise decimal places in calculations for accuracy. Finally, they recap that separable first-order differential equations were previously solved, and Euler's method offers a way to estimate solutions otherwise challenging to obtain directly.

To solve this problem using Euler's method, we are approximating the solution to a differential equation with an initial condition provided. You've already laid out the steps for using Euler's method with \( h = \frac{1}{2} \) and initial conditions at \( x_0 = 1 \), \( y_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Let's break down your work and verify each step to ensure correctness:

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Initial Values:**
   - \( n = 0 \)
   - \( x_0 = 1 \)
   - \( y_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)

2. **Compute \( a_n \) for \( n = 0 \):**

   \[
   a_0 = \frac{x_0^3}{y_0} = \frac{1^3}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \sqrt{2}
   \]

3. **First Iteration (\( n = 1 \)):**

   - \( x_1 = x_0 + h = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \)
   - Compute \( y_1 \):

     \[
     y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot a_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}
     \]

     Simplifying:

     \[
     y_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1 + 1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}
     \]

   - Compute \( a_1 \):

     \[
     a_1 = \frac{x_1^3}{y_1} = \frac{(1.5)^3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3.375}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]

     Simplifying:

     \[
     a_1 = \frac{3.375 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{27\sqrt{2}}{16}
     \]

4. **Second Iteration (\( n = 2 \)):**

   - \( x_2 = x_1 + h = 1.5 + \frac{1}{2} = 2 \)
   - Compute \( y_2 \):

     \[
     y_2 = y_1 + h \cdot a_1 = \sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{27\sqrt{2}}{16}
     \]

     Simplifying:

     \[
     y_2 = \sqrt{2} + \frac{27\sqrt{2}}{32} = \frac{32\sqrt{2} + 27\sqrt{2}}{32} = \frac{59\sqrt{2}}{32}
     \]

### True Value Calculation

The true value at \( x = 2 \) is calculated as:

\[
y(2) = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828
\]

### Conclusion

- The approximate value using Euler's method with \( h = \frac{1}{2} \) at \( x = 2 \) is:

  \[
  y_2 = \frac{59\sqrt{2}}{32} \approx 2.607
  \]

- The true value is approximately \( 2.828 \).

This confirms your calculations and shows the approximation error inherent in Euler's method with this step size.

The text provides an explanation of using Euler's Method for estimating solutions to differential equations. The speaker describes a scenario where the exact solution is 2.8, but their estimation with Euler's method, using a step size \( h \) of 0.5 (or "a half"), yields approximately 2.6. This difference arises because the curve being estimated has a positive second derivative, causing an underestimation due to its upward concavity.

The speaker explains that decreasing the step size (\( h \)) would improve accuracy: using \( h = 0.25 \) or \( h = 0.125 \) would yield closer results to the exact answer. The text also notes how accuracy decreases with larger \( x \)-values (further along the curve).

Euler's Method is introduced as a way to approximate solutions for non-separable first-order differential equations when separation of variables isn't possible. It involves calculating changes in \( y \) (\( \Delta y \)) based on the slope at each point and moving horizontally by \( \Delta x \). The text concludes with a recap that Euler's Method is useful in contexts like estimating growth rates or decay, where exact solutions might be challenging to find.

The speaker apologizes for repeated content due to recording issues but aims to ensure understanding of differential equations, their practical applications, and the use of numerical methods such as Euler’s for estimation.
