Yanni, a new surgical registrar, presents on coagulation disorders and blood transfusion in trauma patients. He highlights that trauma is a significant global cause of death, often complicated by the "deadly triangle" of coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis, which are interdependent issues.

### Etiology of Hemostatic Disorders in Trauma:

1. **Dilution**: While fluid resuscitation can dilute clotting factors, this usually isn't problematic until substantial blood volume replacement occurs.
   
2. **Hypothermia**: Transfusion of cold packed red cells and crystalloid fluids can lower body temperature significantly, affecting platelet function and increasing fibrinolysis.

3. **Specific Trauma Sites**:
   - Brain injury patients are at high risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to thromboplastin exposure.
   - Severe liver injuries affect the production of clotting factors.
   - Extensive soft tissue damage can also lead to DIC.

4. **Underlying Conditions**: Pre-existing conditions like von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, chronic liver disease, and anticoagulant use (e.g., warfarin) complicate coagulation.

### Recognition and Treatment:

- Abnormal bleeding patterns should prompt immediate treatment without waiting for test results.
- Basic tests include INR, PTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen levels.
- Maintaining a platelet count above 50 is crucial to prevent microvascular bleeds in heavily transfused patients.
- Platelet function assessment remains challenging due to factors like hypothermia and liver disease.

Yanni emphasizes the complexity of managing coagulation disorders in trauma patients and the need for prompt recognition and treatment.
