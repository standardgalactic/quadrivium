The text describes a method to find the center of mass of a triangular plate with uniform density using calculus. The triangle has vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,2) and is defined by the line \( y = 2x \). Its density is given as 3 grams per square centimeter.

To find the center of mass:

1. **Concepts**: 
   - Density is expressed as mass per unit area since the plate is uniform.
   - The moment around an axis is calculated as mass times distance from the axis.
   - The center of mass coordinates for a thin strip are given by \( (x, x) \).

2. **Calculations**:
   - For a thin strip at position \( x \), its length is \( 2x \) and width \( dx \).
   - Area = \( 2x \cdot dx \).
   - Mass of the strip = Density \(\times\) Area = \( 6x \, dx \).

3. **Moments**:
   - Moment about the x-axis: Integral of \( y \) coordinate times differential mass (\( x \times 6x \, dx \)).
   - Moment about the y-axis: Integral of \( x \) coordinate times differential mass (\( x \times 6x \, dx \)).

4. **Integrals**:
   - Integrate from 0 to 1 for both moments and total mass.
   - Resulting integrals give a moment value of 2 for both axes.
   - Total mass is calculated as 3.

5. **Center of Mass Coordinates**:
   - \( x \)-coordinate: Moment about the y-axis divided by total mass = \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - \( y \)-coordinate: Moment about the x-axis divided by total mass = \( \frac{2}{3} \).

Thus, the center of mass is located at \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \).

The text discusses comparing calculations for finding the center of mass in different geometrical shapes using calculus. It explains that while dealing with straight lines, the approach is straightforward and consistent. However, when working with more complex shapes like semicircles or parabolas, the values can differ. To determine the center of mass for these shapes, calculus methods such as integrating along a specified axis (e.g., a Phillip's-axis) are used. The text also references the use of "аша's rule," which likely pertains to a specific method or principle in this context, although the details of this rule are not elaborated upon. Overall, it highlights how calculus is applied differently depending on the geometry of the object being analyzed.
