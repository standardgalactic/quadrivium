It looks like you're working through a problem involving the method of Lagrange multipliers. This is a technique used in optimization problems where we want to find the maximum or minimum of a function subject to one or more constraints.

Let's break down what you have and how to proceed:

### Problem Setup

You are given:
- Objective Function: \( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + xy + y^2 + yz + z^2 \)
- Constraint: \( g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0 \)

You want to find the maximum value of \( f \) on the sphere defined by the constraint.

### Lagrange Multipliers Method

To apply the method of Lagrange multipliers:
1. **Find Gradients**: Calculate the gradients of both functions.
   - Gradient of \( f(x, y, z) \): 
     \[
     \nabla f = (2x + y, x + 2y + z, y + 2z)
     \]
   - Gradient of \( g(x, y, z) \):
     \[
     \nabla g = (2x, 2y, 2z)
     \]

2. **Set up the Equations**: According to Lagrange multipliers, you need:
   \[
   \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g
   \]
   This gives us three equations:
   - \( 2x + y = \lambda (2x) \)
   - \( x + 2y + z = \lambda (2y) \)
   - \( y + 2z = \lambda (2z) \)

3. **Solve the System**: Solve these equations along with the constraint.

### Solving the Equations

Let's solve the system step-by-step:

1. From the first equation:
   \[
   2x + y = 2\lambda x \implies y = 2\lambda x - 2x
   \]

2. From the second equation:
   \[
   x + 2y + z = 2\lambda y 
   \]
   Substitute \( y = 2\lambda x - 2x \) into this equation:
   \[
   x + 2(2\lambda x - 2x) + z = 2\lambda (2\lambda x - 2x)
   \]
   Simplify to find a relationship between \( x, y, z, \) and \( \lambda \).

3. From the third equation:
   \[
   y + 2z = 2\lambda z 
   \]
   Substitute \( y = 2\lambda x - 2x \):
   \[
   (2\lambda x - 2x) + 2z = 2\lambda z
   \]
   Simplify to find another relationship.

4. **Use the Constraint**: Finally, use the constraint:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1
   \]

### Conclusion

Solving these equations will give you values for \( x, y, z, \) and \( \lambda \). You can then substitute back into the original function \( f(x, y, z) \) to find the maximum value.

This process might involve some algebraic manipulation or numerical methods if the algebra becomes too complex. If you have access to computational tools, they can be very helpful in solving these systems of equations.

The text discusses solving an optimization problem using Lagrange multipliers, a mathematical method for finding local maxima and minima of functions subject to constraints.

1. **Lagrange Multiplier Method**: 
   - The problem involves equations with variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) under certain conditions.
   - Using the gradient and Lagrange multipliers (\(\lambda\)), relationships between these variables are established, leading to simplified equations.
   - By manipulating these equations (e.g., dividing one by another), relationships such as \(x = z\) and expressions for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) or \(z\) are derived.

2. **Solving the Equations**:
   - The constraint equation is used to solve for specific values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
   - This results in possible solutions, including both positive and negative values for these variables.
   - Substituting these values back into the function confirms which combinations yield maximum or minimum values.

3. **Application to a Real-World Problem**:
   - The method is applied to design a closed cylindrical tank with a volume constraint of 1000 cubic meters.
   - Different costs are associated with materials for the top/bottom and the side of the cylinder.
   - The goal is to minimize the cost while satisfying the volume requirement.

The text illustrates how mathematical techniques like Lagrange multipliers can be used in practical scenarios, such as optimizing material costs in manufacturing.

This text provides a step-by-step explanation of using constrained optimization to minimize the cost of manufacturing a closed cylindrical tank with a given volume. Here’s a summary:

1. **Problem Definition**: The task is to find the minimum cost for constructing a cylindrical tank with a specified volume (1000 cubic meters) where both the top/bottom and sides are made from different materials at varying costs per square meter.

2. **Volume and Cost Formulas**:
   - The volume \( V \) of the cylinder is given by \( \pi r^2 h = 1000 \).
   - The cost \( C \) involves two parts: the top/bottom (at $2/m²) and the side ($2.50/m²). 
     - Top/Bottom area costs are calculated as \( 4\pi r^2 \).
     - Side area costs are calculated as \( 5\pi rh \).

3. **Optimization Using Lagrange Multipliers**:
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost function \( C = 4\pi r^2 + 5\pi rh \) subject to the volume constraint.
   - The method involves finding the gradients of the cost and volume functions, then setting up equations with a Lagrange multiplier (\( \lambda \)).

4. **Gradient Equations**:
   - For radius \( r \): \( 8\pi r + 5\pi h = 2\lambda \pi rh \).
   - For height \( h \): \( 5\pi r = \lambda \pi r^2 \).

5. **Solving for the Ratio of Dimensions**:
   - Simplifying these equations, a relationship between radius and height is derived: \( r = \frac{5}{8}h \).
   - This ratio allows substituting back into the volume constraint to solve for specific dimensions that minimize cost.

This example elegantly illustrates how constrained optimization can be used in real-world scenarios like minimizing manufacturing costs while adhering to physical constraints.

The text discusses solving a manufacturing problem involving optimizing dimensions (radius \( r \) and height \( h \)) of a cylinder to achieve a specific volume while minimizing costs. Given that the radius is five-eighths of the height, which itself equals 1,000 when squared, we derive an equation: \( \pi \times \left(\frac{25}{64} h^3\right) = 1000 \). Solving this provides values for \( h \) and subsequently \( r \), ensuring the volume remains at 1,000 cubic meters. Using these dimensions in a cost equation will determine the minimal total manufacturing costs while maintaining the required volume. This solution effectively balances the constraints of achieving the target volume with minimizing expenses.

To solve the problem using Lagrange multipliers, let’s follow these steps systematically:

### Problem Recap
We want to maximize \( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + xy + y^2 + yz + z^2 \) subject to the constraint \( g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0 \).

### Lagrange Multipliers Setup
The method of Lagrange multipliers involves introducing a new variable (the Lagrange multiplier, \(\lambda\)) and solving the following system of equations:

1. \(\nabla f(x, y, z) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y, z)\)
2. \(g(x, y, z) = 0\)

### Gradients
Calculate the gradients:
- \(\nabla f(x, y, z) = (2x + y, x + 2y + z, y + 2z)\)
- \(\nabla g(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\)

### System of Equations
From the Lagrange condition \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get:

1. \(2x + y = \lambda \cdot 2x\)
2. \(x + 2y + z = \lambda \cdot 2y\)
3. \(y + 2z = \lambda \cdot 2z\)

And the constraint:
4. \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\)

### Solving the System
Let's solve these equations step-by-step:

#### Equation 1:
\[ 2x + y = \lambda \cdot 2x \]
If \(x \neq 0\), then:
\[ \lambda = \frac{2x + y}{2x} \]

#### Equation 3:
\[ y + 2z = \lambda \cdot 2z \]
If \(z \neq 0\), then:
\[ \lambda = \frac{y + 2z}{2z} \]

Equating the two expressions for \(\lambda\):
\[ \frac{2x + y}{2x} = \frac{y + 2z}{2z} \]
Cross-multiply to get:
\[ (2x + y) \cdot 2z = (y + 2z) \cdot 2x \]
\[ 4xz + 2yz = 2xy + 4xz \]
Cancel \(4xz\) from both sides:
\[ 2yz = 2xy \]
If \(y \neq 0\), divide by \(2y\):
\[ z = x \]

#### Equation 2:
\[ x + 2y + z = \lambda \cdot 2y \]
Substitute \(z = x\):
\[ x + 2y + x = \lambda \cdot 2y \]
\[ 2x + 2y = \lambda \cdot 2y \]
If \(y \neq 0\), divide by \(2y\):
\[ \lambda = \frac{x + y}{y} \]

#### Equating Expressions for \(\lambda\)
We have:
1. \(\lambda = \frac{2x + y}{2x}\)
2. \(\lambda = \frac{x + y}{y}\)

Equate them:
\[ \frac{2x + y}{2x} = \frac{x + y}{y} \]
Cross-multiply:
\[ (2x + y) \cdot y = (x + y) \cdot 2x \]
\[ 2xy + y^2 = 2x^2 + 2xy \]
Cancel \(2xy\):
\[ y^2 = 2x^2 \]
Thus, \(y = \sqrt{2}x\) or \(y = -\sqrt{2}x\).

### Substituting Back into the Constraint
Use \(z = x\) and \(y = \pm \sqrt{2}x\) in the constraint:
\[ x^2 + (\pm \sqrt{2}x)^2 + x^2 = 1 \]
\[ x^2 + 2x^2 + x^2 = 1 \]
\[ 4x^2 = 1 \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \]

### Possible Solutions
1. \(x = \frac{1}{2}, y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, z = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(x = \frac{1}{2}, y = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, z = \frac{1}{2}\)
3. \(x = -\frac{1}{2}, y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, z = -\frac{1}{2}\)
4. \(x = -\frac{1}{2}, y = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, z = -\frac{1}{2}\)

### Evaluating \(f(x, y, z)\)
Calculate \(f\) for each solution:

1. \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\)
   - \(= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{1}{4}\)
   - \(= 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)

2. \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{2}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{1}{4}\)
   - \(= 1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)

3. \(f\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)

4. \(f\left(-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)

### Conclusion
The maximum value of \(f\) is \(1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), and the minimum value is \(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

This text is a step-by-step explanation of using Lagrange multipliers to solve an optimization problem involving finding maximum values under constraints, followed by an example of applying mathematical modeling in manufacturing.

1. **Lagrange Multiplier Method**: 
   - The speaker describes the process of solving equations derived from setting up the gradient of a function equal to a scalar multiple (λ, lambda) times the gradient of a constraint.
   - They manipulate these equations by multiplying and dividing terms, ultimately leading to expressions for x, y, and z in terms of each other.
   - The speaker finds that \(x = z\) and \(y = 2x^2\).
   - Using the given constraint (e.g., sum of squares equals a constant), they solve for specific values of x, y, and z: \(\pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

2. **Optimization under Constraints**:
   - The process highlights checking both positive and negative solutions due to the squared terms, concluding that either all must be positive or all negative for maximizing the function.
   
3. **Application in Manufacturing**:
   - A practical problem is introduced: designing a closed cylindrical tank with a specific volume (1000 cubic meters) using two types of metal at different costs ($2 and $2.50 per square meter).
   - The goal is to minimize the cost while meeting the volume constraint, illustrating how mathematical optimization can be applied in real-world scenarios.

The text demonstrates both theoretical problem-solving through calculus and its practical application in engineering or economics.

The text presents a problem of minimizing the cost of manufacturing a closed cylindrical tank with a fixed volume, illustrating constrained optimization. The objective is to calculate the minimum cost given specific material costs and constraints:

1. **Volume Constraint:** The cylinder has a fixed volume of 1000 cubic meters.

2. **Cost Components:**
   - Top and bottom are made from metal costing $2 per square meter.
   - Sides are made from a different material costing $2.50 per square meter.

3. **Formulas Used:**
   - Volume of the cylinder is given by \( V = \pi r^2 h \).
   - Cost for top and bottom surfaces is calculated as \( 4\pi r^2 \times \$2 \), resulting in \( 8\pi r^2 \) dollars.
   - Cost for the side surface (a rectangle when unfolded, with dimensions circumference by height) is \( 2\pi rh \times \$2.50 \), equating to \( 5\pi rh \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost Function:** The total cost function in terms of radius \( r \) and height \( h \) is:
   \[
   C(r, h) = 8\pi r^2 + 5\pi rh
   \]

5. **Optimization using Lagrange Multipliers:**
   - The volume constraint is used with the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the optimal values for \( r \) and \( h \).
   - Gradients are set up:
     - Gradient of cost function, \( \nabla C = (8\pi r + 5\pi h, 5\pi r) \)
     - Gradient of volume constraint, \( \nabla V = (2\pi rh, \pi r^2) \)

6. **Equations Derived:**
   - The optimization leads to equations relating \( r \) and \( h \):
     - \( 8r + 5h = 10h \)
     - Simplifying gives \( 8r = 5h \), or \( r = \frac{5}{8}h \).

7. **Solution:**
   - Substitute \( r = \frac{5}{8}h \) back into the volume constraint to solve for specific values of \( r \) and \( h \).

This problem beautifully demonstrates how calculus, specifically constrained optimization with Lagrange multipliers, can be applied to real-world problems involving multidimensional shapes intersecting under constraints.

The text explains a mathematical approach to solving a manufacturing problem involving optimizing costs. The task involves determining dimensions (radius \( r \) and height \( h \)) for an object with a specified volume of 1,000 cubic meters while minimizing costs.

Given:
- Radius \( r = \frac{5}{8}h \)
- Volume formula: \(\pi r^2 h = 1000\)

Substituting the value of \( r \) in terms of \( h \), the equation becomes \(\pi \left( \frac{25}{64} \right) h^3 = 1000\).

By solving this equation, one can determine both \( h \) and \( r \). Once these dimensions are found, they can be plugged into a cost function to find the total manufacturing cost. This solution will ensure that the volume remains at 1,000 cubic meters while minimizing costs.
