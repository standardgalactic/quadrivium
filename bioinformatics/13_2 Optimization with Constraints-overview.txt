It looks like you're working through a problem involving the method of Lagrange multipliers. This is a technique used in optimization problems where we want to find the maximum or minimum of a function subject to one or more constraints.

Let's break down what you have and how to proceed:

### Problem Setup

You are given:
- Objective Function: \( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + xy + y^2 + yz + z^2 \)
- Constraint: \( g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0 \)

You want to find the maximum value of \( f \) on the sphere defined by the constraint.

### Lagrange Multipliers Method

To apply the method of Lagrange multipliers:
1. **Find Gradients**: Calculate the gradients of both functions.
   - Gradient of \( f(x, y, z) \): 
     \[
     \nabla f = (2x + y, x + 2y + z, y + 2z)
     \]
   - Gradient of \( g(x, y, z) \):
     \[
     \nabla g = (2x, 2y, 2z)
     \]

2. **Set up the Equations**: According to Lagrange multipliers, you need:
   \[
   \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g
   \]
   This gives us three equations:
   - \( 2x + y = \lambda (2x) \)
   - \( x + 2y + z = \lambda (2y) \)
   - \( y + 2z = \lambda (2z) \)

3. **Solve the System**: Solve these equations along with the constraint.

### Solving the Equations

Let's solve the system step-by-step:

1. From the first equation:
   \[
   2x + y = 2\lambda x \implies y = 2\lambda x - 2x
   \]

2. From the second equation:
   \[
   x + 2y + z = 2\lambda y 
   \]
   Substitute \( y = 2\lambda x - 2x \) into this equation:
   \[
   x + 2(2\lambda x - 2x) + z = 2\lambda (2\lambda x - 2x)
   \]
   Simplify to find a relationship between \( x, y, z, \) and \( \lambda \).

3. From the third equation:
   \[
   y + 2z = 2\lambda z 
   \]
   Substitute \( y = 2\lambda x - 2x \):
   \[
   (2\lambda x - 2x) + 2z = 2\lambda z
   \]
   Simplify to find another relationship.

4. **Use the Constraint**: Finally, use the constraint:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1
   \]

### Conclusion

Solving these equations will give you values for \( x, y, z, \) and \( \lambda \). You can then substitute back into the original function \( f(x, y, z) \) to find the maximum value.

This process might involve some algebraic manipulation or numerical methods if the algebra becomes too complex. If you have access to computational tools, they can be very helpful in solving these systems of equations.

The text discusses solving an optimization problem using Lagrange multipliers, a mathematical method for finding local maxima and minima of functions subject to constraints.

1. **Lagrange Multiplier Method**: 
   - The problem involves equations with variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) under certain conditions.
   - Using the gradient and Lagrange multipliers (\(\lambda\)), relationships between these variables are established, leading to simplified equations.
   - By manipulating these equations (e.g., dividing one by another), relationships such as \(x = z\) and expressions for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) or \(z\) are derived.

2. **Solving the Equations**:
   - The constraint equation is used to solve for specific values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
   - This results in possible solutions, including both positive and negative values for these variables.
   - Substituting these values back into the function confirms which combinations yield maximum or minimum values.

3. **Application to a Real-World Problem**:
   - The method is applied to design a closed cylindrical tank with a volume constraint of 1000 cubic meters.
   - Different costs are associated with materials for the top/bottom and the side of the cylinder.
   - The goal is to minimize the cost while satisfying the volume requirement.

The text illustrates how mathematical techniques like Lagrange multipliers can be used in practical scenarios, such as optimizing material costs in manufacturing.

This text provides a step-by-step explanation of using constrained optimization to minimize the cost of manufacturing a closed cylindrical tank with a given volume. Here’s a summary:

1. **Problem Definition**: The task is to find the minimum cost for constructing a cylindrical tank with a specified volume (1000 cubic meters) where both the top/bottom and sides are made from different materials at varying costs per square meter.

2. **Volume and Cost Formulas**:
   - The volume \( V \) of the cylinder is given by \( \pi r^2 h = 1000 \).
   - The cost \( C \) involves two parts: the top/bottom (at $2/m²) and the side ($2.50/m²). 
     - Top/Bottom area costs are calculated as \( 4\pi r^2 \).
     - Side area costs are calculated as \( 5\pi rh \).

3. **Optimization Using Lagrange Multipliers**:
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost function \( C = 4\pi r^2 + 5\pi rh \) subject to the volume constraint.
   - The method involves finding the gradients of the cost and volume functions, then setting up equations with a Lagrange multiplier (\( \lambda \)).

4. **Gradient Equations**:
   - For radius \( r \): \( 8\pi r + 5\pi h = 2\lambda \pi rh \).
   - For height \( h \): \( 5\pi r = \lambda \pi r^2 \).

5. **Solving for the Ratio of Dimensions**:
   - Simplifying these equations, a relationship between radius and height is derived: \( r = \frac{5}{8}h \).
   - This ratio allows substituting back into the volume constraint to solve for specific dimensions that minimize cost.

This example elegantly illustrates how constrained optimization can be used in real-world scenarios like minimizing manufacturing costs while adhering to physical constraints.

The text discusses solving a manufacturing problem involving optimizing dimensions (radius \( r \) and height \( h \)) of a cylinder to achieve a specific volume while minimizing costs. Given that the radius is five-eighths of the height, which itself equals 1,000 when squared, we derive an equation: \( \pi \times \left(\frac{25}{64} h^3\right) = 1000 \). Solving this provides values for \( h \) and subsequently \( r \), ensuring the volume remains at 1,000 cubic meters. Using these dimensions in a cost equation will determine the minimal total manufacturing costs while maintaining the required volume. This solution effectively balances the constraints of achieving the target volume with minimizing expenses.
