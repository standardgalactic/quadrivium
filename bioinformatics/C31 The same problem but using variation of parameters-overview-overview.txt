Here's a summarized version of the method of variation of parameters used to solve a non-homogeneous linear differential equation:

1. **Setup**: The task is to solve a differential equation using variation of parameters. The complementary solution \( y_c \) is given as \( c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 x e^{2x} \).

2. **Particular Solution**: We seek functions \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \) such that the particular solution \( y_p = u_1 y_1 + u_2 y_2 \), where \( y_1 = e^{2x} \) and \( y_2 = x e^{2x} \).

3. **Wronskian**: The Wronskian of the solutions is computed as:
   \[
   W = e^{4x}
   \]

4. **Integrals for \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \)**: These are calculated using:
   - \( u_1 = -\int \frac{y_2 f(x)}{W} \, dx \)
   - \( u_2 = \int \frac{y_1 f(x)}{W} \, dx \)

5. **Function \( f(x) \)**: Given as \( f(x) = (x + 1)e^{2x} \).

6. **Calculations**:
   - For \( u_1 \): 
     \[
     u_1 = -\int (x^2 + x) \, dx = -\left(\frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2\right)
     \]
   - For \( u_2 \):
     \[
     u_2 = \int (x + 1) \, dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x
     \]

7. **Particular Solution \( y_p \)**:
   - Combine the results:
     \[
     y_p = \left(\frac{1}{2}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2\right)e^{2x}
     \]

8. **General Solution**: The complete solution is:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 x e^{2x} + \left(\frac{1}{2}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2\right)e^{2x}
   \]

The method confirms the solution aligns with another approach, demonstrating consistency.
