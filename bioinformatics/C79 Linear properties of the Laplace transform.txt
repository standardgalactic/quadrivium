This is a very quick look at an example just of stating the fact that a Laplace transform is a linear type of transform, so if it says linear.
If I have the Laplace transform of these two functions, a times, some constant times the f of t, some another constant times another function of t,
that would be the same as writing the Laplace transform of a times the f of t, plus the Laplace transform of b times the g, ooh, that should be g, that should be the g of t.
We're not done yet, but because we can also now bring this a out as a constant, a constant does come out, the Laplace transform of the f of t, plus b times the Laplace transform of the g of t.
So those are things we should remember.
So if we ask to get, for instance, the Laplace transform of, say for instance, 1 plus, let's make it, let's make it 4t, for instance.
So that was going to be equal to the Laplace transform of 1, we know what that is, is 1 over s, plus 4 times the Laplace transform of t.
And we know what that is, that is plus 4 times, and t that is 1 over s squared.
So it's going to be 1 over s plus 4 over s squared.
That's an easy answer quickly to that, to that problem.
So just keep in mind what you can do with these Laplace transform, bring the constants out,
write them each on their own terms because it is a linear transform.
