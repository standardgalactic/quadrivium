The text provides instructions on installing IPython Notebook in a Linux environment, specifically using Ubuntu 14.04 with the XFCE desktop. Here are the main ideas:

1. **Introduction to IPython**: IPython is presented as an advanced IDE for developing mathematics code, surpassing the default IDLE that comes with Python installations.

2. **Installation Process**:
   - Visit ipython.org and navigate through installation instructions.
   - For Linux systems, open a terminal and use `sudo` commands to install necessary libraries: `python-matplotlib`, `python-numpy`, `python-scipy`, `python-sympy`, and `python-pandas`.
   - Install IPython Notebook itself using `sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook`.

3. **Post-Installation Steps**:
   - Ensure Python is updated or installed (commonly included in Linux distributions).
   - Learn basic navigational commands (`ls`, `cd`) to manage files and directories.

4. **Using IPython Notebook**:
   - Launch the notebook via a terminal command, which opens in a web browser.
   - Navigate to desired folders for saving work, such as Dropbox for automatic syncing.
   - Use features like creating new notebooks, running code cells, embedding HTML markup, plotting with matplotlib, and more.

5. **File Management**:
   - Save notebooks by renaming or using the save function within IPython Notebook.
   - Close the notebook properly to ensure files are saved on disk.
   - Terminate the terminal session of IPython Notebook using `Ctrl+C` twice.

Overall, while the installation process may not be as straightforward as some other environments, IPython offers robust features for mathematical and scientific computing.
