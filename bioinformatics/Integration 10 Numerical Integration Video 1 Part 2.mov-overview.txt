The text explains how to calculate the area under a curve using the trapezoidal rule, which involves dividing the region into trapezoids. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is given as base times the average height of the two sides divided by 2. For approximating the area under a curve, equal bases with width \(\Delta x\) are used, and the y-values create trapezoids. The area of each trapezoid is calculated using \(\Delta x\) multiplied by the sum of adjacent y-values divided by 2 (\(\frac{\Delta x (y_0 + y_1)}{2}\)), and this process is repeated for subsequent segments.

By factoring out \(\Delta x/2\), a common factor, we derive the trapezoidal sums equation. This method is noted to be equivalent to averaging left and right Riemann sums. The text hints at further exploration of sums in future discussions or videos.

The text explains how to approximate the area under a curve using the trapezoidal rule. A trapezoid's area is calculated by multiplying its base by the sum of its two heights, divided by 2. In this context, the curve is divided into equal segments (bases) with width \(\Delta x\), and trapezoids are formed by connecting the y-values at these segments.

The area of each trapezoid is given by \(\Delta x \times (\text{y-value}_1 + \text{y-value}_2)/2\). By factoring out \(\Delta x/2\), the formula for the total trapezoidal sum is derived, which resembles the average of left and right Riemann sums. The text indicates that further exploration on sums will be discussed in a subsequent video.
