Let's break down the problem you've presented regarding diffraction patterns and resolving power. The context involves understanding how light diffracts through a slit or an aperture and forms bands on a screen.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Diffraction Pattern**: When light passes through a narrow slit, it spreads out and creates a pattern of bright and dark bands on a screen. This is due to interference of the light waves emerging from different parts of the slit.

2. **Central Maximum**: The central bright band in a diffraction pattern is the most intense and widest. It is formed between the first minima (dark bands) on either side of the center.

3. **Minima and Maxima**: 
   - Minima occur where destructive interference happens, calculated by \( a \sin(\theta) = m\lambda \), where \( a \) is the slit width, \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction, \( m \) is an integer (1, 2, 3,... for minima), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.
   - Maxima occur between these minima.

4. **Resolving Power**: The ability to distinguish two closely spaced features in a pattern. It's related to the width of the central maximum and how well subsequent maxima can be distinguished from each other.

### Calculations:

1. **Central Maximum Width**:
   - The angular position of the first minima is given by \( \sin(\theta_1) = \frac{\lambda}{a} \).
   - For small angles, \( \tan(\theta) \approx \sin(\theta) \), so the width on a screen at distance \( L \) is approximately \( 2L \tan(\theta_1) \).

2. **Width of Subsequent Bands**:
   - The position of subsequent minima and maxima can be calculated similarly using \( m\lambda = a \sin(\theta_m) \).
   - For the second minimum, use \( m=2 \), and so on.

3. **Comparing Band Widths**:
   - Calculate the positions \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) for the first and second minima using \( y = L \tan(\theta_m) \).
   - The width of the band between these minima is \( |y_2 - y_1| \).

4. **Resolving Two Close Wavelengths**:
   - Use Rayleighâ€™s criterion: two wavelengths are just resolved when the principal maximum of one coincides with the first minimum of the other.
   - This can be expressed as \( \Delta\lambda = \frac{\lambda^2}{a} \) for small differences in wavelength.

### Example Problem:

Given:
- Wavelengths \( \lambda_1 = 632 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda_2 = 474 \, \text{nm} \).
- Slit width \( a \).
- Distance to screen \( L \).

1. **Calculate Angular Positions**:
   - For \( m=3 \) with \( \lambda_1 \): \( \sin(\theta_{31}) = \frac{3\lambda_1}{a} \).
   - For \( m=4 \) with \( \lambda_2 \): \( \sin(\theta_{42}) = \frac{4\lambda_2}{a} \).

2. **Calculate Positions on Screen**:
   - \( y_{31} = L \tan(\theta_{31}) \).
   - \( y_{42} = L \tan(\theta_{42}) \).

3. **Check for Coincidence**:
   - If \( y_{31} \approx y_{42} \), the two wavelengths are just resolved.

4. **Calculate Band Widths**:
   - Use the formula for minima and maxima to find subsequent band widths and compare them.

This approach allows you to analyze diffraction patterns, calculate the positions of bands on a screen, and understand resolving power in terms of wavelength differences.
