Let's break down the problem you've presented regarding diffraction patterns and resolving power. The context involves understanding how light diffracts through a slit or an aperture and forms bands on a screen.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Diffraction Pattern**: When light passes through a narrow slit, it spreads out and creates a pattern of bright and dark bands on a screen. This is due to interference of the light waves emerging from different parts of the slit.

2. **Central Maximum**: The central bright band in a diffraction pattern is the most intense and widest. It is formed between the first minima (dark bands) on either side of the center.

3. **Minima and Maxima**: 
   - Minima occur where destructive interference happens, calculated by \( a \sin(\theta) = m\lambda \), where \( a \) is the slit width, \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction, \( m \) is an integer (1, 2, 3,... for minima), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.
   - Maxima occur between these minima.

4. **Resolving Power**: The ability to distinguish two closely spaced features in a pattern. It's related to the width of the central maximum and how well subsequent maxima can be distinguished from each other.

### Calculations:

1. **Central Maximum Width**:
   - The angular position of the first minima is given by \( \sin(\theta_1) = \frac{\lambda}{a} \).
   - For small angles, \( \tan(\theta) \approx \sin(\theta) \), so the width on a screen at distance \( L \) is approximately \( 2L \tan(\theta_1) \).

2. **Width of Subsequent Bands**:
   - The position of subsequent minima and maxima can be calculated similarly using \( m\lambda = a \sin(\theta_m) \).
   - For the second minimum, use \( m=2 \), and so on.

3. **Comparing Band Widths**:
   - Calculate the positions \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) for the first and second minima using \( y = L \tan(\theta_m) \).
   - The width of the band between these minima is \( |y_2 - y_1| \).

4. **Resolving Two Close Wavelengths**:
   - Use Rayleighâ€™s criterion: two wavelengths are just resolved when the principal maximum of one coincides with the first minimum of the other.
   - This can be expressed as \( \Delta\lambda = \frac{\lambda^2}{a} \) for small differences in wavelength.

### Example Problem:

Given:
- Wavelengths \( \lambda_1 = 632 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda_2 = 474 \, \text{nm} \).
- Slit width \( a \).
- Distance to screen \( L \).

1. **Calculate Angular Positions**:
   - For \( m=3 \) with \( \lambda_1 \): \( \sin(\theta_{31}) = \frac{3\lambda_1}{a} \).
   - For \( m=4 \) with \( \lambda_2 \): \( \sin(\theta_{42}) = \frac{4\lambda_2}{a} \).

2. **Calculate Positions on Screen**:
   - \( y_{31} = L \tan(\theta_{31}) \).
   - \( y_{42} = L \tan(\theta_{42}) \).

3. **Check for Coincidence**:
   - If \( y_{31} \approx y_{42} \), the two wavelengths are just resolved.

4. **Calculate Band Widths**:
   - Use the formula for minima and maxima to find subsequent band widths and compare them.

This approach allows you to analyze diffraction patterns, calculate the positions of bands on a screen, and understand resolving power in terms of wavelength differences.

It seems like you're exploring the concepts of diffraction patterns, specifically relating to single-slit diffraction and resolving power. Let's break down some key elements based on your description:

### Single-Slit Diffraction

1. **Central Maximum:**
   - The central maximum is the brightest part of a diffraction pattern and spans from \(-\theta_1\) to \(+\theta_1\).
   - Its width can be calculated using:
     \[
     W = 2L \tan(\theta_1)
     \]
   - Where \( L \) is the distance to the screen, and \(\theta_1\) is the angle for the first minimum, given by:
     \[
     \sin(\theta_1) = \frac{\lambda}{a}
     \]
   - Here, \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light, and \( a \) is the slit width.

2. **Subsequent Maxima:**
   - The subsequent maxima are located between minima.
   - For the second minimum (\(m=2\)), the angle \(\theta_2\) is given by:
     \[
     \sin(\theta_2) = \frac{2\lambda}{a}
     \]
   - The width of the band between the first and second minima can be calculated as:
     \[
     W_{12} = L (\tan(\theta_2) - \tan(\theta_1))
     \]

3. **General Pattern:**
   - The pattern becomes narrower for higher order maxima.
   - Each subsequent minimum is given by:
     \[
     \sin(\theta_m) = \frac{m\lambda}{a}
     \]
   - The width of the \(n\)-th band can be calculated similarly using the tangent function.

### Resolving Power

1. **Rayleigh Criterion:**
   - Two sources are resolvable when the central maximum of one coincides with the first minimum of the other.
   - For a circular aperture, this is given by:
     \[
     \theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
     \]
   - Where \( D \) is the diameter of the aperture.

2. **Resolving Power in Spectroscopy:**
   - The resolving power (\(R\)) of a spectrometer is defined as:
     \[
     R = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}
     \]
   - Where \(\Delta \lambda\) is the smallest difference in wavelength that can be distinguished.

### Example Problem

From your description, you seem to be solving for the position where two different wavelengths produce the same angle for their minima. This involves setting:
\[
m_1 \lambda_1 = m_2 \lambda_2
\]
Solving this equation gives the order numbers \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) that satisfy this condition.

### Calculation Example

Given:
- \(\lambda_1 = 632 \, \text{nm}\)
- \(\lambda_2 = 474 \, \text{nm}\)

The ratio of orders is:
\[
\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = \frac{474}{632} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Thus, \(m_1 = 3\) and \(m_2 = 4\).

The position on the screen where these conditions are met can be calculated using:
\[
y = L \tan(\theta)
\]
Where \(\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{m \lambda}{a}\right)\).

This approach helps in understanding how different wavelengths interfere and resolve at various positions, which is crucial for applications like spectroscopy. If you have specific values or further questions, feel free to ask!
