Let us get some examples, some example problems on our belts.
We have an electron in two states, state A and B,
and we measure the magnetic quantum number, the maximum,
for state A with 2, and the maximum quantum,
the magnetic quantum number for state B, we have that as 1.
What does that mean?
If the magnetic quantum number, the maximum, is 2,
that means it could have been negative 1,
or negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, and 2.
And here it could have been negative 1, 0, and 1.
But we have the maximum of 2 and 1 in those two states.
What is the ratio of the angular momentum of that electron
in state A divided by state B?
Now, first of all, we need an equation for
the quantum mechanical angular momentum,
and that is the square root of L times L plus 1 times H bar.
Now, what is L?
Now, remember, L, if the maximum of that was 2,
then L of A also had to be 2,
and L of B then had to equal 1.
And as much as we define the magnetic quantum number
according to the orbital quantum number,
if the orbital quantum number was 2,
then we would have gotten that range.
If it was 1, we would have gotten that domain,
as you say, and then we have these,
let's call them as possibilities, then for state B.
So if I take state L A divided by L B,
I'm going to have the square root of
2 times 3, 2 times 3 times H bar,
divided by, this one is going to be L is 1,
1 times 2 is 2,
also H bar, those are going to cancel out,
and I'm going to be left with the square root of 6
divided by 2,
that equals the square root of 3,
being the ratio of the angular momentum
of these two states.
Second problem, we have a hydrogen atom
in the second excited state.
We want to use the quantum mechanical model,
and we want to know what the total energy is
of that atom,
what the magnitude of the maximum angular momentum is,
and what the maximum value of the z component
of that angular momentum of this electron is.
First of all, when we say the atom is in the second excited state,
let's see what is possible.
Second excited state, don't make this mistake,
remember, ground, first, second, third excited state,
ground, N equals 1,
so second excited state means N equals 3.
What are the possibilities then for the orbital quantum number?
That is going to be 0, 1, and 2,
which means in L's possibilities,
negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, and 2.
And we have the spin quantum number,
M is positive or negative 1 half.
But we want to know the total energy.
Now, energy is still going to be,
energy is still going to be negative 2,
pi squared, M, k squared,
e to the power 4 over H squared times
z squared over N squared.
So you can put all of those in,
see if you get the same answer as me,
and then I'm going to,
that will be in joules,
and I've got to divide by 1.6 times 10 to the power
negative 90 joules to get the answer
in electron volts,
and I get negative 1.50 electron volts.
Okay, nothing spectacular there.
What is the magnitude of the maximum angular momentum?
So for maximum angular momentum,
remember L is going to equal the square root of L,
L plus 1 times H bar.
And maximum value of L is going to be a 2,
so it will be 2 times 3 is 6.
Square root of 6 times H bar,
that gives me a magnitude of maximum angular momentum
of 2.58 times 10 to the power
negative 34 joules seconds
for angular momentum,
or kilograms meters squared per second.
And the z component of that,
remember that will then be,
that will just be ML times H bar,
and the maximum ML is also going to be 2.
2 times H bar gives me,
2.11 times 10 to the power
negative 34 joules seconds.
Good problem.
Now, problem number three,
which is the last problem in this section,
and all we're going to do is,
in any of these problems,
as it gets a bit more complicated,
it's just about playing with the algebra
of the equations that we do know
or the calculus.
And we are told that we measure
the maximum angular momentum
of an electron in a hydrogen atom
as being 8.948 times 10 to the power
negative 4 joules seconds,
4 significant digits,
so we're going to use Planck's constant
for significant digits as well.
We want to know the maximum z component
of the angular momentum
of that electron.
That hydrogen atom,
we know our equation for this,
this is going to be ML times H bar,
so if we're using ML max here,
that is just going to equal,
ML max,
it's just going to equal L max.
So we require L max,
in other words,
this is just going to be L,
the maximum value of L times H bar.
And the reason why we say this,
remember,
let's say N equals 2,
that will give me an L value,
orbital quantum number of 1,
which is going to be 0 or 1,
which is going to give me an ML
of negative 1, 0, and 1.
So if we're talking about the maximums,
those two,
that's going to be 1,
and that's 1 as well.
So for this particular problem,
well, for problems like this,
these two are equal.
for the maximum.
And I don't know what L is,
but I do know what the angular momentum is.
I don't know what the orbital quantum number is,
but I do know what angular momentum is,
and I know angular momentum equals
d square root of L times L plus 1 times H bar.
And I can solve for the orbital angular,
orbital quantum number there.
So L squared is going to equal L squared plus L times H bar squared.
So I've just squared both sides,
which can slip out of my square root side,
and I've just multiplied L out.
In other words,
L squared is going to equal H bar squared L squared plus H bar squared L.
I can write that as a nice layout in the standard form of a quadratic polynomial,
and as much as H bar squared L squared plus H bar squared L minus L squared equals 0.
And I can use the equation for solving other quadratic equation.
And as much as L is my unknown,
these are my constants A, B, and C.
Note that C is negative L squared.
So I'm going to have that L is going to equal negative B.
B is H bar squared plus minus the square root of B squared.
That is going to give me an H bar to the power of 4 minus 4 times A.
A is H bar squared.
H bar squared.
And L and C is negative L squared.
Negative L squared all divided by 2 times A,
and A is H bar squared.
So I can plug all those values in,
remembering that I'm looking for the maximum value.
And I think what might happen there is I can't remember.
I did the equation before.
You've got to use the negative there and the negative there,
which will give you an L of negative 8,
but I'm looking for the maximum,
which will leave me an L.
Just do it on your calculator.
You'll see what the maximum value is.
Whether you use positive or negative,
I give an L value of 8.
And if I, 8 times H bar is going to give me an L,
maximum Z component of the angular momentum of 8.436,
436 times 10 to the power of negative 34 joule seconds.
