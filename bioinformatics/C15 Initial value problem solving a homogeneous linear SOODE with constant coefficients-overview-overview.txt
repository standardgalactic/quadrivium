The text outlines a method for solving an initial value problem involving a linear second-order homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The specific differential equation given is:

\[ y'' - 4y' - 5y = 0, \]

with the initial conditions \( y(1) = 0 \) and \( y'(1) = 2 \).

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Characteristic Equation**: Formulate the characteristic (auxiliary) equation from the differential equation:
   \[
   m^2 - 4m - 5 = 0
   \]
   The roots of this quadratic are found to be \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = 5 \).

2. **General Solution**: With these roots, the general solution for \( y(x) \) is:
   \[
   y(x) = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^{5x}
   \]

3. **Apply Initial Conditions**:
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the general solution to apply the initial condition \( y(1) = 0 \):
     \[
     0 = c_1 e^{-1} + c_2 e^5
     \]
   - Differentiate \( y(x) \) to find \( y'(x) \), then substitute \( x = 1 \) for the condition \( y'(1) = 2 \):
     \[
     y'(x) = -c_1 e^{-x} + 5c_2 e^{5x}
     \]
     \[
     2 = -c_1 e^{-1} + 5c_2 e^5
     \]

4. **Solve for Constants**:
   Solve the system of equations derived from the initial conditions to find \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \):
   \[
   c_2 = \frac{e}{3}, \quad c_1 = -\frac{1}{3} e^6
   \]

5. **Particular Solution**:
   Substitute these constants back into the general solution to get the particular solution:
   \[
   y(x) = -\frac{1}{3} e^{6-x} + \frac{e}{3} e^{5x}
   \]

### Simplification:

The text also discusses simplifying expressions involving \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). Initially, incorrect values were noted for these constants in the description. The correct particular solution is given by substituting correctly derived values:
\[
y(x) = -\frac{1}{3} e^{6-x} + \frac{e}{3} e^{5x}
\]

This expression can be further manipulated algebraically if needed, though the text suggests potential simplification methods, such as factoring and combining like terms. The goal is to represent \( y(x) \) in a clean, simplified form.

### Conclusion:

The solution involves determining the general form of the differential equation's solution using its characteristic roots, applying initial conditions to find specific constants, and then expressing the particular solution in its simplest possible form.
