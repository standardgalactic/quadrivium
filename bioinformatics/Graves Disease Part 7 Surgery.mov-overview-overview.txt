The video highlights the use of thyroidectomy as a surgical treatment for Graves' disease, though it is rarely employed due to associated risks such as scarring, bleeding, infection, laryngeal nerve injury, and parathyroid damage. It may be considered under specific circumstances including patient preference, in children or pregnant women, large goiters causing physical or cosmetic concerns, ophthalmopathy, allergy to thionomides, or suspicion of thyroid cancer.

Total thyroidectomy is currently favored by many experts as it offers definitive treatment for hyperthyroidism and eliminates the need for radiation. Pre-surgical preparation typically involves using thionomides, beta blockers, and inorganic iodide to safely manage hyperthyroid symptoms. Despite its risks, when performed with careful surgical techniques, the procedure can be a valid option for treating Graves' disease.
