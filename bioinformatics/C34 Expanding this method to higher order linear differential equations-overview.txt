The text describes using Cramer's rule in conjunction with determinants called "Ronskians" (likely a reference to Wronskians) to solve differential equations. The process involves finding solutions \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \) by integrating expressions that involve these Ronskians.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Cramer's Rule Application**: The text mentions using Cramer's rule to replace columns in a matrix with a column vector \( b \), which consists of 0 and the function \( f(x) \).

2. **Ronskians (Wronskians)**: These are determinants used in solving differential equations. Two Ronskians are mentioned, derived from the first derivatives of functions \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \).

3. **Integration Process**: The solution involves integrating the ratio of a specific Ronskian to the overall Ronskian with respect to \( x \).

4. **Higher-Order Extensions**: The method can be extended to higher-order differential equations, where more complex matrices are used.

5. **Determinant Calculation**: For third-order cases, a 3x3 matrix is involved, and the determinant is calculated by choosing rows or columns strategically for simplicity.

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding linear algebra to perform these calculations effectively.

The text explains how to use Cramer's Rule in finding particular solutions for a second-order differential equation through integrals involving determinants known as Wronskians (also referred to as "Ronskian" here). It describes the process of setting up and solving for functions \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \), which are used to construct a solution.

The method involves:
- Determining two particular solutions, \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \), whose derivatives help form the Wronskian determinant.
- Using Cramer's Rule to replace one column of this Wronskian with a new vector (matrix \( b \)) composed of 0 and a function \( f(x) \).
- Integrating these modified determinants divided by the original Wronskian to find particular solutions \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \).

The text then extends this concept to higher-order differential equations, illustrating how to calculate corresponding Wronskians for third-order cases using similar determinant techniques. This involves replacing columns in larger matrices with vectors and calculating determinants systematically, highlighting the necessity of understanding linear algebra for these processes.
