The text describes using Cramer's rule in conjunction with determinants called "Ronskians" (likely a reference to Wronskians) to solve differential equations. The process involves finding solutions \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \) by integrating expressions that involve these Ronskians.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Cramer's Rule Application**: The text mentions using Cramer's rule to replace columns in a matrix with a column vector \( b \), which consists of 0 and the function \( f(x) \).

2. **Ronskians (Wronskians)**: These are determinants used in solving differential equations. Two Ronskians are mentioned, derived from the first derivatives of functions \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \).

3. **Integration Process**: The solution involves integrating the ratio of a specific Ronskian to the overall Ronskian with respect to \( x \).

4. **Higher-Order Extensions**: The method can be extended to higher-order differential equations, where more complex matrices are used.

5. **Determinant Calculation**: For third-order cases, a 3x3 matrix is involved, and the determinant is calculated by choosing rows or columns strategically for simplicity.

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding linear algebra to perform these calculations effectively.
