The text discusses solving a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation using an auxiliary equation approach. Starting with the quadratic equation \( am^2 + bm + c = 0 \), it explores finding roots for specific values: \( b = -10 \) and \( c = 25 \). After calculating, it's determined that the discriminant is negative (\(100 - 100\)), indicating repeated roots. The equation simplifies to \( m^2 - 10m + 25 = 0 \), which factors as \( (m-5)^2 = 0 \). This results in a double root of \( m_1 = m_2 = 5 \).

For repeated roots, the solution to the differential equation takes the form: 

\[ y = c_1 e^{m_1 x} + c_2 x e^{m_1 x} \]

Thus, for this case, the solution is:

\[ y = c_1 e^{5x} + c_2 x e^{5x} \]

The text describes solving a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. Starting from the quadratic equation \( am^2 + bm + c = 0 \), it derives its roots using the auxiliary equation method. The specific example given has coefficients that simplify the equation to \( m^2 - 10m + 25 = 0 \). This factors into \( (m - 5)^2 = 0 \), indicating a repeated root of \( m_1 = m_2 = 5 \).

For differential equations with repeated roots, the general solution takes the form:

\[ y = c_1 e^{m_1 x} + c_2 x e^{m_1 x}. \]

Thus, for this equation, the solution is:

\[ y = c_1 e^{5x} + c_2 x e^{5x}. \] 

This provides a complete solution to the differential equation based on its characteristic roots.
