The text describes a demonstration of solving a system of first-order ordinary differential equations using Python with the SymPy library within an IPython notebook. The author walks through setting up and solving these equations by defining variables and functions, creating a matrix representation, and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Here's a summary:

1. **Introduction to Tools**: The example uses an IPython notebook with SymPy for symbolic mathematics in Python.
2. **Equations Setup**: Two first-order ordinary differential equations are set up: \( \frac{dX}{dT} = X + 2Y \) and \( \frac{dY}{dT} = -\frac{1}{2}X + Y \), with both \(X\) and \(Y\) as functions of \(T\).
3. **Matrix Representation**: A matrix \(A\) is defined to represent the system, with elements derived from the coefficients in the equations.
4. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The eigenvalues are calculated using SymPy's methods: \((1 - i)\) and \((1 + i)\). Corresponding eigenvectors are also found.
5. **Solution Construction**: Using the eigenvalue-eigenvector method, solutions \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) for the system are constructed. These involve exponential functions modulated by sine and cosine terms based on the real (\(\alpha\)) and imaginary (\(\beta\)) parts of the eigenvalues.
6. **Result Presentation**: The final expressions for \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are derived using the components of the eigenvectors, showing how these solutions evolve over time.

This demonstration emphasizes both the symbolic computation capabilities of SymPy and the mathematical principles underlying differential equations in a vector field context.

The text outlines a process for solving a system of equations and visualizing the results using Python's Matplotlib library. The author describes working with variables \( x \) and \( y \), which are represented as elements in column vectors, with coefficients denoted by \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). They set initial conditions: \( x(0) = 2 \) and \( y(0) = 0 \), and solve for these coefficients. The solutions lead to expressions for \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \):

- \( x(t) = e^t \cos(t) \)
- \( y(t) = -e^t \sin(t) \)

The author then provides code to plot these functions over time using a loop with a step size of 0.1, starting from \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t < 2 \). They encounter an error due to variable name conflicts (using symbolic names like \( x \), \( y \), and \( t \) directly in the code) but correct this by using alternative variable names. The plot is generated with red dots, showing the trajectory of points defined by these equations over time.
