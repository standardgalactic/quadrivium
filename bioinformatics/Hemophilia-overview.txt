Haemophilia A and B are bleeding disorders caused by deficiencies in clotting factors 8 and 9, respectively. Most individuals with haemophilia are diagnosed early; however, some may present later due to spontaneous bleeding into joints or muscles if their factor activity is less than 1%, indicating severe haemophilia. Moderate and mild cases often result in bleeding following trauma or surgery. Diagnosis involves a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test and specific factor analysis. Management includes administering the deficient coagulation factors before and after surgery, typically for 7 to 10 days depending on the surgical procedure.

Haemophilia A and B are genetic disorders caused by deficiencies in blood clotting factors, specifically factor VIII and IX, respectively. By the time patients present with haemophilia, they are typically well-diagnosed. Severe cases (activity levels below 1%) can lead to spontaneous bleeding into joints and muscles, while moderate and mild cases may result from trauma or excessive bleeding during and after surgery.

Diagnosis involves observing a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) followed by specific factor analysis to identify the deficiency. Management includes administering specific coagulation factors before surgery and for 7-10 days afterward, depending on the surgery type.
