Haemophilia A and B are bleeding disorders caused by deficiencies in clotting factors 8 and 9, respectively. Most individuals with haemophilia are diagnosed early; however, some may present later due to spontaneous bleeding into joints or muscles if their factor activity is less than 1%, indicating severe haemophilia. Moderate and mild cases often result in bleeding following trauma or surgery. Diagnosis involves a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test and specific factor analysis. Management includes administering the deficient coagulation factors before and after surgery, typically for 7 to 10 days depending on the surgical procedure.
