The text discusses the integration of products of functions in calculus, building on the concept of finding antiderivatives for simpler functions. It introduces a product rule for integration, which is derived from the differentiation product rule. This new rule allows us to integrate a product of two functions by expressing it as one function times the antiderivative of the other, minus the integral of the derivative of the first function times the antiderivative of the second.

An example provided is integrating \( x \times \cos(x) \). By choosing \( f = x \) and \( g' = \cos(x) \), the calculations become straightforward: the derivative of \( x \) is 1, and the antiderivative of \( \cos(x) \) is \( \sin(x) \). Applying the product rule for integration results in:

\[
x \sin(x) - \int \sin(x) \, dx = x \sin(x) + \cos(x) + C
\]

The text highlights the importance of strategically selecting parts of the function to simplify the integration process when dealing with products.
