The video discusses primary hyperparathyroidism, focusing on its causes and pathogenesis. It begins with an overview of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium homeostasis, noting the rise and subsequent decline in hypercalcemia diagnoses since 1974 when routine blood calcium measurement began.

Hyperparathyroidism has evolved from a condition with overt clinical symptoms to one often detected subclinically due to elevated PTH levels before symptomatic presentation. It is more prevalent in females and individuals over 45 years old.

The regulation of ionized calcium, the active form of calcium important for many metabolic processes, is tightly controlled by PTH. Calcium sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands detect decreases in ionized calcium, triggering PTH release to raise calcium levels through mechanisms such as bone resorption, increased kidney activation of vitamin D3, and enhanced calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.

The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a single adenoma in one of the parathyroid glands (90%), followed by double adenomas (5%) and glandular hyperplasia involving all four glands (also about 5%). Parathyroid carcinoma, though rare, can also lead to increased PTH levels.

Associated conditions include familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes like MEN1 and MEN2, as well as familial isolated hyperparathyroidism. Thiazide diuretics, which decrease calcium excretion, may unmask mild hypercalcemia in patients with underlying primary hyperparathyroidism.
