The video discusses how to project one vector onto another using the concept of orthogonal projections. The speaker explains projecting vector \( \mathbf{u} \) onto vector \( \mathbf{a} \). To simplify, they place vector \( \mathbf{a} \) along the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system.

The projection involves decomposing vector \( \mathbf{u} \) into two components: one parallel to \( \mathbf{a} \) (denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_1 \)) and one orthogonal (perpendicular) to \( \mathbf{a} \) (denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_2 \)). The goal is to express these components mathematically.

Using the dot product, the speaker derives that the magnitude of the projection component (\( \mathbf{w}_1 \)) can be calculated using:

\[ \|\mathbf{w}_1\| = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|} \]

Recognizing that \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) is a scalar multiple of \( \mathbf{a} \), they express it as:

\[ \mathbf{w}_1 = k\mathbf{a} \]

where \( k = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \). Thus, the projection of \( \mathbf{u} \) onto \( \mathbf{a} \) is:

\[ \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \mathbf{a} \]

The orthogonal component (\( \mathbf{w}_2 \)) is then:

\[ \mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{u} - \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} \]

Adding \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{w}_2 \) gives back the original vector \( \mathbf{u} \):

\[ \mathbf{u} = \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{w}_2 \]

Finally, the norm of the projection is discussed as an additional point. This breakdown helps in understanding how vectors can be projected and decomposed relative to each other using orthogonal projections.

The text discusses how to express the norm of a projection of one vector onto another in terms of their dot product. It begins by considering the scalar projection formula, where \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} \) is divided by the square of the norm of vector \(\mathbf{a}\), multiplied by \(\mathbf{a}\). The focus is on deriving an expression for the length (magnitude) of this projection.

The key steps in the text involve:

1. Recognizing that the scalar component of a dot product can be expressed using absolute values to emphasize magnitude without direction.
2. Using trigonometric relationships, specifically \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}\) as \( |\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{a}| \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{a}\).
3. Substituting this into the scalar projection formula to find that it simplifies to \(|\mathbf{u}| \cos(\theta) / |\mathbf{a}|\), which represents the length of the orthogonal projection of \(\mathbf{u}\) onto \(\mathbf{a}\).
4. Concluding that this is equivalent to forming a right triangle where the projected vector's magnitude corresponds to one side, making the relationship geometrically intuitive.

The text ties this understanding into vector decomposition: breaking down a vector (\(\mathbf{u}\)) into components parallel and orthogonal to another vector (\(\mathbf{a}\)), ensuring that these components add back to the original vector. This process is essential in vector analysis for simplifying problems by aligning vectors along specific directions.
