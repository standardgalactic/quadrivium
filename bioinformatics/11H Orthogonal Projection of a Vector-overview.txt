The video discusses how to project one vector onto another using the concept of orthogonal projections. The speaker explains projecting vector \( \mathbf{u} \) onto vector \( \mathbf{a} \). To simplify, they place vector \( \mathbf{a} \) along the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system.

The projection involves decomposing vector \( \mathbf{u} \) into two components: one parallel to \( \mathbf{a} \) (denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_1 \)) and one orthogonal (perpendicular) to \( \mathbf{a} \) (denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_2 \)). The goal is to express these components mathematically.

Using the dot product, the speaker derives that the magnitude of the projection component (\( \mathbf{w}_1 \)) can be calculated using:

\[ \|\mathbf{w}_1\| = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|} \]

Recognizing that \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) is a scalar multiple of \( \mathbf{a} \), they express it as:

\[ \mathbf{w}_1 = k\mathbf{a} \]

where \( k = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \). Thus, the projection of \( \mathbf{u} \) onto \( \mathbf{a} \) is:

\[ \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \mathbf{a} \]

The orthogonal component (\( \mathbf{w}_2 \)) is then:

\[ \mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{u} - \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} \]

Adding \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{w}_2 \) gives back the original vector \( \mathbf{u} \):

\[ \mathbf{u} = \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{w}_2 \]

Finally, the norm of the projection is discussed as an additional point. This breakdown helps in understanding how vectors can be projected and decomposed relative to each other using orthogonal projections.

The text discusses how to express the norm of a projection of one vector onto another in terms of their dot product. It begins by considering the scalar projection formula, where \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} \) is divided by the square of the norm of vector \(\mathbf{a}\), multiplied by \(\mathbf{a}\). The focus is on deriving an expression for the length (magnitude) of this projection.

The key steps in the text involve:

1. Recognizing that the scalar component of a dot product can be expressed using absolute values to emphasize magnitude without direction.
2. Using trigonometric relationships, specifically \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}\) as \( |\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{a}| \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{a}\).
3. Substituting this into the scalar projection formula to find that it simplifies to \(|\mathbf{u}| \cos(\theta) / |\mathbf{a}|\), which represents the length of the orthogonal projection of \(\mathbf{u}\) onto \(\mathbf{a}\).
4. Concluding that this is equivalent to forming a right triangle where the projected vector's magnitude corresponds to one side, making the relationship geometrically intuitive.

The text ties this understanding into vector decomposition: breaking down a vector (\(\mathbf{u}\)) into components parallel and orthogonal to another vector (\(\mathbf{a}\)), ensuring that these components add back to the original vector. This process is essential in vector analysis for simplifying problems by aligning vectors along specific directions.

The text provides an explanation of how to project one vector onto another using orthogonal projections. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Vectors and Projections**: The speaker discusses projecting a component of vector \( \mathbf{u} \) onto vector \( \mathbf{a} \). This involves decomposing \( \mathbf{u} \) into two components: one parallel to \( \mathbf{a} \) (denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_1 \)) and one orthogonal to \( \mathbf{a} \) (denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_2 \)).

2. **Using a Coordinate System**: The projection is easier to visualize in a Cartesian coordinate system, where vector \( \mathbf{a} \) lies along the x-axis. This allows for straightforward decomposition of vectors.

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The cosine of the angle \( \theta \) between \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{a} \) is expressed as the ratio of the length of \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) to the length of \( \mathbf{u} \).
   - Using the dot product, the cosine can also be represented as \( \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{a}\|} \).

4. **Equating Cosines**: By equating these two expressions for cosine, the length of \( \mathbf{w}_1 \) is found to be proportional to \( \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|} \), where the proportionality constant \( k \) is derived as \( \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \).

5. **Orthogonal Projection Formula**: The orthogonal projection of \( \mathbf{u} \) onto \( \mathbf{a} \) is given by:
   \[
   \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \mathbf{a}
   \]

6. **Orthogonal Component**: The component of \( \mathbf{u} \) orthogonal to \( \mathbf{a} \) is:
   \[
   \mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{u} - \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u}
   \]

7. **Verification**: Adding the parallel and orthogonal components returns the original vector \( \mathbf{u} \), confirming the decomposition is correct.

8. **Norm of Projection**: The norm of the projection can be calculated using the derived formula, providing a measure of how much of \( \mathbf{u} \) lies along \( \mathbf{a} \).

This explanation helps in understanding vector projections and their applications in various mathematical contexts.

The text discusses how to express the scalar projection (or dot product) of one vector onto another in terms of their norms and angles. The core idea involves breaking down a vector \( \mathbf{u} \) into components parallel and orthogonal to another vector \( \mathbf{a} \). This process uses the formula:

\[ \text{Projection of } \mathbf{u} \text{ onto } \mathbf{a} = \frac{\left| \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a} \right|}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \times \mathbf{a} \]

Here, \( \|\mathbf{a}\| \) denotes the norm (or length) of vector \( \mathbf{a} \), and \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a} \) represents the dot product. The scalar projection is expressed in terms of the magnitude:

\[ \left| \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|} \right| = \| \mathbf{u} \| \cos(\theta) / \|\mathbf{a}\| \]

where \( \theta \) is the angle between vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{a} \). This expression can be interpreted as:

1. The projection of vector \( \mathbf{u} \) onto vector \( \mathbf{a} \), scaled by \( \|\mathbf{a}\| \).
2. Using the cosine rule, this simplifies to show that the length of the component of \( \mathbf{u} \) along \( \mathbf{a} \) is \( \|\mathbf{u}\| \cos(\theta) \).

The text also connects these concepts with geometric interpretations involving triangles and highlights that the vector projection splits \( \mathbf{u} \) into components parallel (along \( \mathbf{a} \)) and orthogonal to it. This decomposition ensures that the sum of these two components equals the original vector \( \mathbf{u} \).
