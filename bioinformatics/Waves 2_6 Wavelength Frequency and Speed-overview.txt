Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given information:

### Given:
- Linear density (\(\mu\)): \(1.6 \times 10^{-4}\) kg/m
- Standing wave equation: 
  \[
  Y = 0.021 \, \text{m} \cdot \sin(2 \, \text{m}^{-1} \cdot X - 30 \, \text{s}^{-1} \cdot T)
  \]

### Find:
1. Velocity in the medium.
2. Tension in the medium.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify Wave Parameters

From the wave equation \(Y = A \sin(kX - \omega T)\), we can identify:
- Wavenumber (\(k\)): \(2 \, \text{m}^{-1}\)
- Angular frequency (\(\omega\)): \(30 \, \text{s}^{-1}\)

#### 2. Calculate the Wavelength (\(\lambda\))

The relationship between wavenumber and wavelength is:
\[
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
\]
Solving for \(\lambda\):
\[
\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k} = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi \, \text{m}
\]

#### 3. Calculate the Frequency (\(f\))

The relationship between angular frequency and frequency is:
\[
\omega = 2\pi f
\]
Solving for \(f\):
\[
f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{30}{2\pi} \approx 4.77 \, \text{Hz}
\]

#### 4. Calculate the Velocity (\(v\))

Velocity of a wave is given by:
\[
v = f \lambda
\]
Substitute the values for \(f\) and \(\lambda\):
\[
v = 4.77 \times \pi \approx 15 \, \text{m/s}
\]

#### 5. Calculate the Tension (\(\tau\))

The velocity of a wave on a string is also given by:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\tau}{\mu}}
\]
Solving for tension \(\tau\):
\[
\tau = \mu v^2
\]
Substitute the values for \(\mu\) and \(v\):
\[
\tau = (1.6 \times 10^{-4}) \times (15)^2 = 0.036 \, \text{N}
\]

### Summary:
- **Velocity in the medium**: \(v \approx 15 \, \text{m/s}\)
- **Tension in the medium**: \(\tau \approx 0.036 \, \text{N}\)

The text outlines a series of calculations related to wave motion and material properties:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: It begins with a frequency given as \( \frac{30}{2\pi} \) inverse seconds, simplified to \( \frac{15}{\pi} \) inverse seconds.

2. **Velocity Calculation**: The velocity is calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Velocity} = \text{Frequency} \times \lambda
   \]
   where \(\lambda\) (wavelength) is \(\pi\) meters. This results in a velocity of 15 meters per second.

3. **Tension Calculation**: The text then moves to calculate tension (\(\tau\)) using the formula:
   \[
   V^2 = \frac{\tau}{\mu}
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \tau = \mu \times V^2
   \]
   Given \(\mu = 1.6 \times 10^{-4}\), and \(V = 15\) m/s, the calculation of \(V^2\) results in 225.

4. **Final Calculation**: Multiplying \(225\) by \(\mu\):
   \[
   \tau = 225 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-4} = 360 \times 10^{-4} = 3.6 \times 10^{-2}\] newtons.

The text concludes with the tension being \(3.6 \times 10^{-2}\) newtons, described as an "easy trouble."
