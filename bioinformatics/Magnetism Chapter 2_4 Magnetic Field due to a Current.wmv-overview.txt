The text describes how to determine the force between two parallel, current-carrying wires using magnetic fields. Here’s a summary:

1. **Magnetic Field of a Wire**: The magnetic field (\(B\)) around a single long, straight wire carrying a current \(I\) is given by \(\mu_0 I / (2 \pi d)\), where \(d\) is the distance from the wire and \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space.

2. **Force Between Wires**: Two parallel wires exert magnetic forces on each other due to their respective magnetic fields. The direction of this force depends on whether the currents in the wires flow in the same or opposite directions:
   - If the currents are in the same direction, the wires attract each other.
   - If the currents are in opposite directions, the wires repel each other.

3. **Using Ampère's Law**: Ampère’s law simplifies finding the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire. It states that the integral of the magnetic field (\(B\)) around a closed loop is equal to \(\mu_0\) times the current enclosed by the loop. This can be used to derive \(B = \mu_0 I / (2 \pi r)\) for a straight wire, where \(r\) is the radius from the wire.

4. **Application of Cross Product**: The force per unit length between two parallel wires is found using the cross product of the magnetic field generated by one wire and the current in the other wire: \(F/L = I_1 B_2\), where \(I_1\) is the current in one wire, and \(B_2\) is the magnetic field at that point due to the second wire.

5. **Symmetry and Enclosed Current**: When applying Ampère’s law, symmetry simplifies calculations (e.g., using a circular path around a straight wire). The enclosed current within this path helps determine the integral of the magnetic field over it.

Overall, these principles help understand electromagnetic interactions between wires carrying electric currents.
