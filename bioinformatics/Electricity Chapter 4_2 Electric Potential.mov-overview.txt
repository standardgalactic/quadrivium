Let's break down and clarify the scenario and calculations for finding points where the electric potential \( V \) is zero due to two charges.

### Problem Setup

You have two point charges:
- Charge 1 (\( q_1 = +5e \)) located at position \( x = 0 \).
- Charge 2 (\( q_2 = -15e \)) located at position \( x = 0.24 \) meters.

The task is to find the points along the x-axis where the electric potential \( V \) is zero, given that \( V_\infty = 0 \).

### Electric Potential Formula

The electric potential \( V \) due to a point charge \( q \) at a distance \( r \) is given by:

\[
V = \frac{kq}{r}
\]

where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant.

For two charges, the total potential at any point on the x-axis is the sum of the potentials due to each charge. We want this total potential to be zero:

\[
V = V_1 + V_2 = \frac{kq_1}{r_1} + \frac{kq_2}{r_2} = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{q_1}{r_1} = -\frac{q_2}{r_2}
\]

### Solving for Points Where \( V = 0 \)

#### 1. Negative x-axis (left of \( q_1 \))

For a point at position \( x = -d \) (where \( d > 0 \)), the distances to the charges are:
- \( r_1 = d \)
- \( r_2 = 0.24 + d \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{d} = \frac{15e}{0.24 + d}
\]

Solving for \( d \):

\[
5(0.24 + d) = 15d
\]
\[
1.2 + 5d = 15d
\]
\[
1.2 = 10d
\]
\[
d = 0.12 \, \text{meters}
\]

Thus, the point where \( V = 0 \) on the negative x-axis is at \( x = -0.12 \) meters.

#### 2. Positive x-axis (right of both charges)

For a point at position \( x = 0.24 + d \), the distances are:
- \( r_1 = 0.24 + d \)
- \( r_2 = d \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{0.24 + d} = \frac{15e}{d}
\]

Solving for \( d \):

\[
5d = 15(0.24 + d)
\]
\[
5d = 3.6 + 15d
\]
\[
-10d = 3.6
\]
\[
d = -0.36 \, \text{meters}
\]

Since \( d \) is negative, this implies there's no point on the positive x-axis beyond both charges where \( V = 0 \).

#### 3. Between the Charges

For a point between the charges at position \( x = b \), where \( 0 < b < 0.24 \):
- \( r_1 = b \)
- \( r_2 = 0.24 - b \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{b} = \frac{15e}{0.24 - b}
\]

Solving for \( b \):

\[
5(0.24 - b) = 15b
\]
\[
1.2 - 5b = 15b
\]
\[
1.2 = 20b
\]
\[
b = 0.06 \, \text{meters}
\]

Thus, the point where \( V = 0 \) between the charges is at \( x = 0.06 \) meters.

### Summary

The points along the x-axis where the electric potential is zero are:
- \( x = -0.12 \) meters (left of both charges)
- \( x = 0.06 \) meters (between the charges)

There is no point to the right of both charges where \( V = 0 \).

The text discusses solving a problem involving distances and proportionality between charges. It mentions a specific distance of 0.24, which is divided into two parts: one part being \(0.24 - x\). The solution approach involves using algebraic methods or recognizing the proportionality relationship between charges and distances. The total distance must sum to 0.24. Additionally, there's an emphasis on making this problem-solving method engaging and enjoyable for people, suggesting it can be a fun challenge to tackle.

Let's break down the problem you're dealing with, which involves finding points along the x-axis where the electric potential \( V \) is zero due to two point charges.

### Problem Setup

You have two point charges:
- Charge \( q_1 = +5e \) located at \( x = 0 \).
- Charge \( q_2 = -15e \) located at \( x = 0.24 \, \text{m} \).

The electric potential \( V \) at a point due to a point charge is given by:
\[ V = \frac{kq}{r} \]
where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant, \( q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the point where the potential is being calculated.

### Finding Points Where \( V = 0 \)

The total electric potential at a point on the x-axis due to both charges is:
\[ V_{\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 = \frac{kq_1}{r_1} + \frac{kq_2}{r_2} \]

We want \( V_{\text{total}} = 0 \), so:
\[ \frac{kq_1}{r_1} + \frac{kq_2}{r_2} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{q_1}{r_1} = -\frac{q_2}{r_2} \]

### Solving for the Negative x-axis

For a point on the negative x-axis, let \( x = -d \). Then:
- Distance from \( q_1 \) is \( r_1 = d \).
- Distance from \( q_2 \) is \( r_2 = 0.24 + d \).

Substitute into the equation:
\[ \frac{5e}{d} = \frac{15e}{0.24 + d} \]

Solving for \( d \):
\[ 5(0.24 + d) = 15d \]
\[ 1.2 + 5d = 15d \]
\[ 1.2 = 10d \]
\[ d = 0.12 \, \text{m} \]

So, the point on the negative x-axis where \( V = 0 \) is at \( x = -0.12 \, \text{m} \).

### Solving for the Positive x-axis

For a point on the positive x-axis between the charges, let \( x = d \) where \( 0 < d < 0.24 \). Then:
- Distance from \( q_1 \) is \( r_1 = d \).
- Distance from \( q_2 \) is \( r_2 = 0.24 - d \).

Substitute into the equation:
\[ \frac{5e}{d} = \frac{15e}{0.24 - d} \]

Solving for \( d \):
\[ 5(0.24 - d) = 15d \]
\[ 1.2 - 5d = 15d \]
\[ 1.2 = 20d \]
\[ d = 0.06 \, \text{m} \]

So, the point on the positive x-axis where \( V = 0 \) is at \( x = 0.06 \, \text{m} \).

### Conclusion

The electric potential \( V \) is zero at:
- \( x = -0.12 \, \text{m} \) (on the negative x-axis)
- \( x = 0.06 \, \text{m} \) (between the charges on the positive x-axis)

These calculations confirm that there are two points where the potential is zero: one to the left of both charges and one between them.

The text appears to discuss a mathematical or physics problem involving distances and proportions. It mentions calculating a distance of 0.24, subtracting an unknown value \( x \), and emphasizes the proportionality between charges and distances. The solution involves recognizing that these two distances must sum up to 0.24. Additionally, there's mention of a challenge related to CRM (Customer Relationship Management) or possibly a person named John scoring 5 on one side of a problem. The overall tone suggests enthusiasm about solving such problems and encourages others to find them enjoyable and engaging.
