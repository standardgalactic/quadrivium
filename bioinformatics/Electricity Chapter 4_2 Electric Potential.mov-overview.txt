Let's break down and clarify the scenario and calculations for finding points where the electric potential \( V \) is zero due to two charges.

### Problem Setup

You have two point charges:
- Charge 1 (\( q_1 = +5e \)) located at position \( x = 0 \).
- Charge 2 (\( q_2 = -15e \)) located at position \( x = 0.24 \) meters.

The task is to find the points along the x-axis where the electric potential \( V \) is zero, given that \( V_\infty = 0 \).

### Electric Potential Formula

The electric potential \( V \) due to a point charge \( q \) at a distance \( r \) is given by:

\[
V = \frac{kq}{r}
\]

where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant.

For two charges, the total potential at any point on the x-axis is the sum of the potentials due to each charge. We want this total potential to be zero:

\[
V = V_1 + V_2 = \frac{kq_1}{r_1} + \frac{kq_2}{r_2} = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{q_1}{r_1} = -\frac{q_2}{r_2}
\]

### Solving for Points Where \( V = 0 \)

#### 1. Negative x-axis (left of \( q_1 \))

For a point at position \( x = -d \) (where \( d > 0 \)), the distances to the charges are:
- \( r_1 = d \)
- \( r_2 = 0.24 + d \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{d} = \frac{15e}{0.24 + d}
\]

Solving for \( d \):

\[
5(0.24 + d) = 15d
\]
\[
1.2 + 5d = 15d
\]
\[
1.2 = 10d
\]
\[
d = 0.12 \, \text{meters}
\]

Thus, the point where \( V = 0 \) on the negative x-axis is at \( x = -0.12 \) meters.

#### 2. Positive x-axis (right of both charges)

For a point at position \( x = 0.24 + d \), the distances are:
- \( r_1 = 0.24 + d \)
- \( r_2 = d \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{0.24 + d} = \frac{15e}{d}
\]

Solving for \( d \):

\[
5d = 15(0.24 + d)
\]
\[
5d = 3.6 + 15d
\]
\[
-10d = 3.6
\]
\[
d = -0.36 \, \text{meters}
\]

Since \( d \) is negative, this implies there's no point on the positive x-axis beyond both charges where \( V = 0 \).

#### 3. Between the Charges

For a point between the charges at position \( x = b \), where \( 0 < b < 0.24 \):
- \( r_1 = b \)
- \( r_2 = 0.24 - b \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5e}{b} = \frac{15e}{0.24 - b}
\]

Solving for \( b \):

\[
5(0.24 - b) = 15b
\]
\[
1.2 - 5b = 15b
\]
\[
1.2 = 20b
\]
\[
b = 0.06 \, \text{meters}
\]

Thus, the point where \( V = 0 \) between the charges is at \( x = 0.06 \) meters.

### Summary

The points along the x-axis where the electric potential is zero are:
- \( x = -0.12 \) meters (left of both charges)
- \( x = 0.06 \) meters (between the charges)

There is no point to the right of both charges where \( V = 0 \).

The text discusses solving a problem involving distances and proportionality between charges. It mentions a specific distance of 0.24, which is divided into two parts: one part being \(0.24 - x\). The solution approach involves using algebraic methods or recognizing the proportionality relationship between charges and distances. The total distance must sum to 0.24. Additionally, there's an emphasis on making this problem-solving method engaging and enjoyable for people, suggesting it can be a fun challenge to tackle.
