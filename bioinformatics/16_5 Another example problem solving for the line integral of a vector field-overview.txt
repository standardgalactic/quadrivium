The text describes a problem involving calculating the work done by a force field on an object moving around a circle. The force field is given as \( F(x, y) = (x^2, xy) \), and the path of motion is along the circle defined by \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), in an anti-clockwise direction.

The key point made here is that since the object returns to its starting position after one complete revolution around the circle, the net displacement is zero. Therefore, no work is done by the force field over this closed path. This conclusion aligns with the property of conservative vector fields, where the line integral around a closed loop is zero.

To mathematically prove this, the text suggests using polar coordinates. By substituting \( x = \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = \sin(\theta) \), the parametric equations for the circle become evident as \( r = 1 \). The vector form of the path becomes \( (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)) \).

The derivative with respect to \(\theta\) gives the tangent vector: \( (-\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta)) \). Substituting these into the force field, we compute the dot product and set up a definite integral from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \). The integral simplifies to zero because the terms cancel each other out.

Thus, mathematically verifying that no net work is done when an object moves once around a closed path in this force field.
