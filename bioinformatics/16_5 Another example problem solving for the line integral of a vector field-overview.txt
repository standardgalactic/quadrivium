The text describes a problem involving calculating the work done by a force field on an object moving around a circle. The force field is given as \( F(x, y) = (x^2, xy) \), and the path of motion is along the circle defined by \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), in an anti-clockwise direction.

The key point made here is that since the object returns to its starting position after one complete revolution around the circle, the net displacement is zero. Therefore, no work is done by the force field over this closed path. This conclusion aligns with the property of conservative vector fields, where the line integral around a closed loop is zero.

To mathematically prove this, the text suggests using polar coordinates. By substituting \( x = \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = \sin(\theta) \), the parametric equations for the circle become evident as \( r = 1 \). The vector form of the path becomes \( (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)) \).

The derivative with respect to \(\theta\) gives the tangent vector: \( (-\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta)) \). Substituting these into the force field, we compute the dot product and set up a definite integral from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \). The integral simplifies to zero because the terms cancel each other out.

Thus, mathematically verifying that no net work is done when an object moves once around a closed path in this force field.

The text describes a problem involving calculating the work done by a force field as an object moves once around a circle defined by \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) in an anti-clockwise direction. The key points are:

1. **Force Field and Path**: The force field is given by \((F_x, F_y) = (x^2, xy)\), and the path of motion is a circle with radius 1.

2. **Initial Assumption**: Since the object starts and ends at the same position after one full revolution, intuitively, no net work is done, implying the line integral should be zero.

3. **Using Polar Coordinates**: To prove this, polar coordinates are used where \(x = \cos(\theta)\) and \(y = \sin(\theta)\). The circle equation simplifies to \(r^2 = 1\), so \(r = 1\).

4. **Parameterization of Path**: The position vector is parameterized as \((\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))\) with its derivative being \((- \sin(\theta), \cos(\theta))\). \(\theta\) varies from \(0\) to \(2\pi\).

5. **Calculating the Work Done**: The work done by the force field is given by the line integral of the dot product of the force vector and the differential path vector, \(\int F \cdot dr\).

6. **Dot Product Evaluation**: Substituting the parameterized expressions into the force field gives \(F = (\cos^2(\theta), \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta))\). The dot product with the derivative of the position vector results in terms that cancel each other out.

7. **Result**: The integral evaluates to zero, confirming that no net work is done over a closed path where the start and end positions are identical.

In summary, despite the complex setup, the symmetry and nature of the circular path ensure that the total work done by the force field on the object after one complete revolution is zero.
