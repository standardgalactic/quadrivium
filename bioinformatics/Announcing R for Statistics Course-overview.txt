This course, "Statistics for Healthcare, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Using the R Language for Statistical Computing," is offered by Stellenbosch University's School for Data Science and Computational Thinking. Dr. Jean Klapper, a Research Fellow at the school, leads this course designed to impart statistical analysis skills using R.

Dr. Klapper emphasizes the importance of data analysis across various domains, aiming to instill in participants the power of extracting knowledge from data. The course is intensive and requires dedication but promises to leave students with a robust understanding of statistical analysis using R.

Participants will have access to various resources including video lectures, PDF documents, practice exercises, solution sets, and live online sessions, all facilitated through RStudio Cloud—a tool that allows users to work on R projects without installing software locally. The course is structured around 15 chapters, each focusing on different aspects of R programming and statistical analysis:

1. **Introduction** - Overview of the course topics.
2. **R Language and RStudio** - Basics of R programming and using RStudio for creating scripts and R Markdown files.
3. **Study Types** - Understanding various study designs and their applications in research, including randomization and formulating research questions.
4. **Statistical Terms and Definitions** - Introduction to fundamental statistical concepts.
5. **Data Manipulation in R** - Techniques for importing data into R, indexing, and selecting subsets of data for analysis.
6. **Tidy Data Principles** - Advanced data manipulation using tidy principles, a modern approach in R.
7. **Summarizing Data** - Calculating measures like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and quantiles.
8. **Comparative Summary Statistics** - Techniques to compare statistics across different groups.
9. **Data Visualization** - Visual representation of data.

Dr. Klapper encourages participants to engage actively with the course material, assuring them that they have access to a vast community of R users for support. The goal is not only to learn but also to join the growing number of domain experts leveraging data analysis in their fields.

The text outlines a structured learning path for understanding data analysis and statistical testing across several chapters. It emphasizes the importance of data visualization in uncovering hidden knowledge and effectively communicating results.

- **Chapter 10** begins by discussing sampling and sampling distributions, introducing the t-distribution.
- **Chapter 11** focuses on parametric methods for comparing means, covering techniques like the students' t-test and analysis of variance.
- **Chapter 12** delves into linear models such as correlation, linear regression, and logistic regression—key tools in statistics.
- **Chapter 13** addresses comparing means across groups, while also teaching how to test assumptions necessary for these methods. If assumptions aren't met, the common tests cannot be used.
- **Chapter 14** provides solutions through non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test when parametric assumptions are violated.
- The final chapter covers tests for non-numerical variables, including the Chi-squared test for independence and Fisher's exact test.

The text also suggests checking a description below for information on which chapters correspond to specific days during the course and advises preparing before starting.

The course "Statistics for Healthcare, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Using the R Language for Statistical Computing" is offered by the School for Data Science and Computational Thinking at Stellenbosch University. It is designed to teach participants how to leverage the power of statistical analysis using R, with Dr. Jean Klapper as the instructor. The course emphasizes that becoming proficient in data analysis and R requires time, effort, and practice.

Dr. Klapper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of statistics through a combination of video lectures, PDF documents, exercises, solution sets, and live online sessions. Participants will use RStudio Cloud for hands-on coding without needing software installation on their computers. The course consists of 15 chapters covering various topics:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the course.
2. **R Language and RStudio Introduction**: Basics of using R and creating documents with R Markdown.
3. **Study Types**: Different types of studies used in research, including randomisation and forming research questions.
4. **Basic Statistical Terms**: Key terms and definitions in statistics.
5. **Data Manipulation in R**: Importing and indexing data for analysis.
6. **Tidy Principles**: A modern approach to data handling in R.
7. **Summarising Data**: Calculation of statistical measures like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and quantiles.
8. **Comparative Summary Statistics**: Comparing statistics across different groups.
9. **Data Visualisation**: Techniques for visually summarizing data.

The course is intended to empower domain experts to utilize data analysis tools effectively, enabling them to critically appraise research literature and contribute actively to their fields. The community of R users offers extensive resources online for further support.

The text outlines a course focused on extracting knowledge from data through visualization and various statistical techniques. Data visualization is emphasized as a method to both reveal hidden insights and effectively communicate results.

- **Chapter 10** introduces sampling, sampling distributions, and the t-distribution.
- **Chapter 11** covers parametric comparisons of means, including the student's t-test and analysis of variance.
- **Chapter 12** discusses linear models like correlation, linear regression, and logistic regression, highlighting their frequent use in statistics.
- **Chapter 13** compares means across groups but notes that certain assumptions must be met for these tests. It also teaches how to test for these assumptions.
- **Chapter 14** addresses situations where assumptions are not met by introducing non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test.
- The final chapter focuses on tests for non-numerical variables, including the Chi-squared test for independence and Fisher's exact test.

The text also mentions that a detailed schedule of chapters covered each day will be provided and encourages preparation before starting the course.
