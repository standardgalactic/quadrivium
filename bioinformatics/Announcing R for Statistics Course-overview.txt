This course, "Statistics for Healthcare, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Using the R Language for Statistical Computing," is offered by Stellenbosch University's School for Data Science and Computational Thinking. Dr. Jean Klapper, a Research Fellow at the school, leads this course designed to impart statistical analysis skills using R.

Dr. Klapper emphasizes the importance of data analysis across various domains, aiming to instill in participants the power of extracting knowledge from data. The course is intensive and requires dedication but promises to leave students with a robust understanding of statistical analysis using R.

Participants will have access to various resources including video lectures, PDF documents, practice exercises, solution sets, and live online sessions, all facilitated through RStudio Cloud—a tool that allows users to work on R projects without installing software locally. The course is structured around 15 chapters, each focusing on different aspects of R programming and statistical analysis:

1. **Introduction** - Overview of the course topics.
2. **R Language and RStudio** - Basics of R programming and using RStudio for creating scripts and R Markdown files.
3. **Study Types** - Understanding various study designs and their applications in research, including randomization and formulating research questions.
4. **Statistical Terms and Definitions** - Introduction to fundamental statistical concepts.
5. **Data Manipulation in R** - Techniques for importing data into R, indexing, and selecting subsets of data for analysis.
6. **Tidy Data Principles** - Advanced data manipulation using tidy principles, a modern approach in R.
7. **Summarizing Data** - Calculating measures like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and quantiles.
8. **Comparative Summary Statistics** - Techniques to compare statistics across different groups.
9. **Data Visualization** - Visual representation of data.

Dr. Klapper encourages participants to engage actively with the course material, assuring them that they have access to a vast community of R users for support. The goal is not only to learn but also to join the growing number of domain experts leveraging data analysis in their fields.

The text outlines a structured learning path for understanding data analysis and statistical testing across several chapters. It emphasizes the importance of data visualization in uncovering hidden knowledge and effectively communicating results.

- **Chapter 10** begins by discussing sampling and sampling distributions, introducing the t-distribution.
- **Chapter 11** focuses on parametric methods for comparing means, covering techniques like the students' t-test and analysis of variance.
- **Chapter 12** delves into linear models such as correlation, linear regression, and logistic regression—key tools in statistics.
- **Chapter 13** addresses comparing means across groups, while also teaching how to test assumptions necessary for these methods. If assumptions aren't met, the common tests cannot be used.
- **Chapter 14** provides solutions through non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test when parametric assumptions are violated.
- The final chapter covers tests for non-numerical variables, including the Chi-squared test for independence and Fisher's exact test.

The text also suggests checking a description below for information on which chapters correspond to specific days during the course and advises preparing before starting.
