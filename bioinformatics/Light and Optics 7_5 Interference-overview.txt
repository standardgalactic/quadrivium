The text describes two scenarios involving the phase difference between waves traveling through different paths and materials.

**Scenario 1:**
- Two setups are described where light with a wavelength of 420 nanometers in a vacuum travels through paths at angles of 45 degrees. 
- In Setup 1, the path consists of segments measuring 1, 2, 3, and 4 meters, while Setup 2 has segments of 1 and 2 meters.
- The distance between reflection points on mirrors is labeled as L.
- To achieve waves that are exactly out of phase (half a wavelength difference), the condition \(N_1 - N_2 = \frac{1}{2}\) must be satisfied, where \(N\) represents the number of wavelengths fitting into path length \(L\).
- For Setup 1, the total path is 5L; for Setup 2, it is L. Solving gives \(L = \frac{\lambda}{8}\), leading to a minimum L of approximately 52.5 nanometers. The next possible L for destructive interference (out-of-phase) is calculated as 158 nanometers.

**Scenario 2:**
- This scenario involves waves traveling through materials with different refractive indices and lengths.
- Material 1 has an index of 1.40 over a length of 4.00 micrometers, while Material 2 has an index of 1.60 over 3.50 micrometers.
- The wavelength in vacuum is given as 600 nanometers.
- The number of wavelengths fitting into each path is calculated: \(N_1 = \frac{40}{6}\) and \(N_2 = \frac{35}{6}\).
- The phase difference is found to be \(\frac{5}{6}\) of a wavelength, indicating an intermediate state between constructive (1 wavelength) and destructive (\(\frac{1}{2}\) wavelength) interference.
- Since 0.833 is closer to 1 than \(\frac{1}{2}\), the waves are closer to being constructively interfered when they exit.

Overall, the text illustrates how path differences in length or refractive index affect phase differences and interference patterns of light waves.

The text describes two optical setups where identical waves are manipulated to become out of phase using different paths and materials.

### Setup 1:
- **Geometry**: Four mirrors at 45-degree angles form a path for light traveling through length \( L \) four times (totaling \( 5L \)) in vacuum.
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum \( L \) such that waves are exactly out of phase by half a wavelength (\( \lambda/2 \)).
- **Calculation**:
  - Difference in path lengths is \( 4L \).
  - Condition: \( 4L/\lambda = 0.5 \).
  - Solve for \( L \): \( L = \lambda/8 \).
  - Given \( \lambda = 420 \) nm, calculate \( L \approx 52.5 \) nm.
  - Next possible \( L \) for destructive interference: \( L = 158 \) nm.

### Setup 2:
- **Geometry**: Two paths through different materials with varying refractive indices and lengths.
- **Objective**: Determine the phase difference in terms of wavelength multiples when waves emerge from these paths.
- **Parameters**:
  - Path 1: Effective index \( n_1 = 1.40 \), length = 4.00 µm.
  - Path 2: Effective index \( n_2 = 1.60 \), length = 3.50 µm.
  - Wavelength in vacuum = 600 nm.

- **Calculation**:
  - Calculate number of wavelengths for each path:
    - \( N_1 = (4.00 \times 10^{-6}) / (600 \times 10^{-9}) = 40/6 \).
    - \( N_2 = (3.50 \times 10^{-6}) / (600 \times 10^{-9}) = 35/6 \).
  - Phase difference: \( N_1 - N_2 = 5/6 \) wavelengths.
- **Interference Type**:
  - Since \( 5/6 \) is closer to 1 than to \( 0.5 \), the interference is intermediate but closer to constructive.

Overall, these setups explore how path differences and material properties affect wave phase relationships and interference patterns.
