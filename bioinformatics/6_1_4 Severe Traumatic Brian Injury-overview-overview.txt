The text discusses the use of propofol and barbiturates in managing intracranial pressure (ICP), particularly when other treatments like mannitol or surgical options are ineffective. Propofol is noted for its short half-life, which allows for quick neurological assessments after discontinuation. However, it can cause hypotension and decreased perfusion pressure, potentially reducing brain circulation despite lowering ICP. Prolonged use may lead to hyperlipidemia, making it unsuitable for pediatric patients.

Barbiturate coma is considered for hemodynamically stable patients with severe traumatic brain injury when other therapies fail. Barbiturates reduce metabolism and inhibit lipid peroxidation but have variable therapeutic benefits correlated with serum concentration and can cause systemic complications. They require an extended period off the medication for reliable neurological assessments.

The text also addresses seizure prophylaxis in traumatic brain injuries, distinguishing between early (within seven days) and late onset seizures. Phenytoin can prevent early post-traumatic seizures but not late ones, nor does it affect mortality rates. Late seizures are treated as new-onset epilepsy. Phenytoin may cause drug-induced fever within one to eight weeks of therapy initiation, complicating management due to its nature as a diagnosis of exclusion.
