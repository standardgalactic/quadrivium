The text breaks down two physics problems involving mirrors:

### Problem 1: Plane Mirror with Incident Ray
- **Scenario:** An incident ray strikes a plane mirror at an angle \( i \). The mirror is then rotated by an angle \( \theta \).
- **Key Concepts:** 
  - Law of Reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
  - When the mirror rotates by \( \theta \), the reflected ray rotates by \( 2\theta \) because both angles change by \( \theta \).
- **Solution:**
  - Initially, both the angle of incidence and reflection are \( i \).
  - After rotation, the angle of incidence becomes \( i + \theta \), and the new angle of reflection is also \( i + \theta \).
  - The reflected ray rotates by \( 2\theta \).

### Problem 2: Concave Mirror and Image Formation
- **Scenario:** An object is placed 3.0 meters from a concave mirror with a focal length of 1.0 meter.
- **Key Concepts:** 
  - Mirror Equation: \(\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{S_0}\)
  - Magnification (\( m \)): \( m = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} = \frac{Y_i}{Y_0} \)
- **Solution:**
  - Calculate the image distance (\( S_i \)) using the mirror equation:
    \[
    \frac{1}{1} = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{3}
    \]
    Solving gives \( S_i = 1.5 \) meters, indicating a real image on the same side as the object.
  - Calculate magnification:
    \[
    m = -\frac{1.5}{3} = -0.5
    \]
    The negative sign indicates an inverted image.
  - Determine the image height (\( Y_i \)):
    Given \( Y_0 = 0.05 \) meters, 
    \[
    Y_i = -0.5 \times 0.05 = -0.025 \text{ meters}
    \]
    The image is inverted and half the size of the object.

### Conclusion:
- **Plane Mirror:** Reflects a ray rotated by \( 2\theta \) when the mirror rotates by \( \theta \).
- **Concave Mirror:** Forms an image at 1.5 meters, which is real, inverted, and half the size of the object.
