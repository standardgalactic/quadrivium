The text discusses numerical methods and their associated errors, focusing on approximating functions with derivatives using Taylor series expansions. It uses an example function \( y = x^2 \) with its derivatives: first derivative \( 2x \), second derivative \( 2 \), and zero for higher-order derivatives.

To approximate the function near a point, one can use Taylor expansion, incorporating terms up to the desired order (denoted by \( k+1 \)), along with an error term that involves the \( (k+1) \)-th derivative evaluated at some unknown point \( c \). The text simplifies this concept by setting \( k = 1 \), which leads to an error expression involving the second derivative.

The discussion then moves to Euler's method, a numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations. It highlights that each step in Euler's method introduces a local truncation error, proportional to \( h^2 \) (where \( h \) is the step size). When these errors accumulate over multiple steps, they result in a global error.

The text explains that reducing the step size \( h \) can significantly decrease the error, as illustrated by halving \( h \), which reduces the error by a factor of four. However, the exact value of the error is complicated by the presence of an unknown point \( c \), which lies between consecutive steps in the numerical method.

To estimate this error practically, one can assume the worst-case scenario by choosing a maximum possible value for the derivative term involving \( c \). This approach provides a conservative estimate of the error, though it may slightly overestimate it.

The text discusses errors in numerical methods, focusing on the Taylor series expansion approach. It considers a function with \( k+1 \) derivatives and explains how these derivatives contribute to constructing a Taylor series around a point. For simplification, it sets \( k = 1 \), leading to an expression involving second derivatives and introduces local truncation errors that occur at each step of the method.

The Euler's formula is presented as one numerical method example, and the text highlights the distinction between local error (occurring per step) and global error (accumulated over all steps). The discussion emphasizes how Taylor series expansions are central to deriving higher-order methods for improving accuracy in these approximations.

A key insight is that reducing the step size \( h \) by half results in the square of the local truncation error shrinking by a factor of four. This demonstrates that decreasing \( h \) significantly reduces errors, though it does not eliminate them entirely due to an unknown value \( c \), which lies between steps.

The text concludes with a strategy for managing the unknown \( c \): choosing its maximum absolute value within the interval to estimate the largest potential error, thereby providing a useful approximation despite some inherent uncertainty.
