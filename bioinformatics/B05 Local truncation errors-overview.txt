The text discusses numerical methods and their associated errors, focusing on approximating functions with derivatives using Taylor series expansions. It uses an example function \( y = x^2 \) with its derivatives: first derivative \( 2x \), second derivative \( 2 \), and zero for higher-order derivatives.

To approximate the function near a point, one can use Taylor expansion, incorporating terms up to the desired order (denoted by \( k+1 \)), along with an error term that involves the \( (k+1) \)-th derivative evaluated at some unknown point \( c \). The text simplifies this concept by setting \( k = 1 \), which leads to an error expression involving the second derivative.

The discussion then moves to Euler's method, a numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations. It highlights that each step in Euler's method introduces a local truncation error, proportional to \( h^2 \) (where \( h \) is the step size). When these errors accumulate over multiple steps, they result in a global error.

The text explains that reducing the step size \( h \) can significantly decrease the error, as illustrated by halving \( h \), which reduces the error by a factor of four. However, the exact value of the error is complicated by the presence of an unknown point \( c \), which lies between consecutive steps in the numerical method.

To estimate this error practically, one can assume the worst-case scenario by choosing a maximum possible value for the derivative term involving \( c \). This approach provides a conservative estimate of the error, though it may slightly overestimate it.
