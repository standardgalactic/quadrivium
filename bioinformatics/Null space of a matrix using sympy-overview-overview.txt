The video outlines a method to calculate specific solutions for the null space of a matrix by setting up a system of linear equations with four unknowns and three equations, all equating to zero. The concept of the null space as a subspace where these solutions reside is introduced. 

Gaussian elimination is employed to convert the coefficient matrix into row echelon form, simplifying the solution process and revealing dependencies among columns that inform possible solutions. By assigning specific values (e.g., \(x_4 = 0\) or \(1\)) to variables, particular solutions for the null space are determined.

The video stresses that any linear combination of these specific solutions will also belong to the null space. Tools like SymPy can expedite this process by providing the reduced row echelon form and directly outputting the solutions for the null space. The method illustrates how to solve systems with dependent variables, ensuring all derived solutions satisfy the original system with zero on the right-hand side.
