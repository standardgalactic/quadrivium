It looks like you're using SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, to solve equations symbolically. Here's a step-by-step guide based on your description:

### Setting Up

First, ensure you've imported the necessary functions from SymPy:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational
```

### Defining Symbols

Define the variable `x` as a symbolic entity:

```python
x = symbols('x')
```

### Solving Equations

Here's how you can solve each equation step-by-step:

1. **Equation: \( \frac{x}{11} = 33 \)**

   - Set up the equation:
     ```python
     eq1 = Eq(x / 11, 33)
     ```
   - Solve for `x`:
     ```python
     solution1 = solve(eq1, x)
     print(solution1)  # Output: [363]
     ```

2. **Equation: \( \frac{1}{x} = 10 \)**

   - Set up the equation:
     ```python
     eq2 = Eq(1 / x, 10)
     ```
   - Solve for `x`:
     ```python
     solution2 = solve(eq2, x)
     print(solution2)  # Output: [Rational(1, 10)]
     ```

3. **Equation: \( \frac{4}{5} \times x = 12 \)**

   - Set up the equation using `Rational`:
     ```python
     eq3 = Eq(Rational(4, 5) * x, 12)
     ```
   - Solve for `x`:
     ```python
     solution3 = solve(eq3, x)
     print(solution3)  # Output: [15]
     ```

4. **Equation: \( 3x + 2 = 4x + 3 \)**

   - Set up the equation:
     ```python
     eq4 = Eq(3 * x + 2, 4 * x + 3)
     ```
   - Solve for `x`:
     ```python
     solution4 = solve(eq4, x)
     print(solution4)  # Output: [-1]
     ```

### Notes

- **Rational Numbers**: Use `Rational(numerator, denominator)` to maintain fractions instead of converting them to decimals.
- **Equation Setup**: Ensure you correctly set up the left-hand side and right-hand side of equations using `Eq(lhs, rhs)`.
- **Solving**: Use `solve(equation, variable)` to find solutions for the specified variable.

This approach will help you solve symbolic equations accurately while maintaining mathematical precision with rational numbers.

The text provides an explanation of how to use symbolic computation in Python, particularly with the SymPy library, to solve mathematical equations easily and efficiently.

1. **Solving Linear Equations:**
   - An equation \(27x - 24 = 4x - 33\) is solved symbolically using the `solve` function, yielding a solution of \(-\frac{9}{23}\).

2. **Handling Rational Functions:**
   - For the equation \(\frac{3x - 5}{x + 3} = \frac{24}{15}\), it's simplified to \(\frac{8}{5}\) using rational numbers before solving, resulting in \(x = 7\).

3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:**
   - The equation \(x^2 = 2\) is solved symbolically, giving solutions of \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(-\sqrt{2}\). Additional constraints can be applied to restrict the solution set (e.g., \(x \geq 0\)).

4. **Interval Constraints:**
   - Solutions can be constrained using intervals; for example, setting \(x\) from 0 to infinity excludes negative solutions, providing only \(\sqrt{2}\) as a valid result when solving \(x^2 = 2\).

5. **Solving Equations with Multiple Variables:**
   - For the area of a circle equation \(A = \pi r^2\), both \(A\) and \(r\) are defined as positive symbols, and solving for \(r\) yields \(r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}\).

The text emphasizes the ease with which equations can be solved using SymPy in Python, allowing users to focus on setting up equations correctly and applying necessary constraints without manual simplification.
