This video discusses alternative treatments for Graves' disease beyond antithyroid drugs. Key points include:

1. **Beta Blockers**: Essential for symptom relief alongside antithyroid medications, with propranolol being effective but contraindicated in asthmatics; calcium channel blockers can be an alternative.

2. **Corticosteroids**: Not first-line due to side effects, but useful for Graves' ophthalmopathy and recommended with radioactive iodine therapy to prevent worsening eye symptoms. Prednisone (60-100 mg/day) is typically used, and intravenous forms require liver monitoring.

3. **Inorganic Iodides and Iodine Compounds**: Temporarily inhibit thyroid hormone production via the Wolf-Chaikov effect, useful pre-surgery with Lugol's solution or potassium iodide to reduce thyroid vascularity, and sodium iopanoate/sodium ipadate for rapid T3 reduction in emergencies.

4. **Potassium Perchlorate**: Used with thionamides for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis but carries a risk of aplastic anemia, limiting long-term use.

The next video will cover treatments like lithium carbonate, cholestyramine, and rituximab.
