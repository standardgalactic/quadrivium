Here's another example so that we can cement our understanding of the first derivative of a natural logarithm function.
And we're asked to get the first derivative of the natural log of x squared plus 3.
Now remember our chain rule. First of all, the x squared plus 3 must be greater, we must say that x squared plus 3 must be greater than 0.
Otherwise that natural logarithm is not defined.
Now our chain rule stated that dy dx equals dy over du times du over dx.
Now what is y? Well we've defined y in our instance here. In our example it's a natural log of x squared plus 3.
That is the function of which we want to get the first derivative of.
But u is, we called u a function of x and in our instance here for the chain rule this is going to be x squared plus 3.
So let us now replace that in our formula here. So we asked the first derivative, dy dx.
Okay, so that will equal d du of the natural log of u.
Remember that x squared plus 3 now equals u. So what we've done here is we've written y in a different way.
Let's do this in red on the top here.
We said y equals the natural log of u, u being x squared plus 3.
So writing dy du, that's all I've done here.
There's my d.
There's the d, there's the d, there's the du, there's the du, and there's the y.
y equals the natural log of u.
There's the natural log of u.
Times,
times
d dx of u.
d dx of u,
and u is x squared plus 3.
So once again, look carefully.
There's my d, there's my d, there's my dx, there's my dx.
And my u is x squared plus 3.
So I've rewritten this equation completely down here.
Let's solve for this.
So dy dx.
What is the first derivative of the natural log of u?
Well, we know that very well by now.
That's 1 over u.
And what is the first derivative of x squared plus 3?
Well, that's just 2x.
All we need to do now is just substitute.
What is 1 over u?
Well, that was u there.
So that's 1 over x squared plus 3 times 2x.
So our answer would be 2x over x squared plus 3.
