and so in the previous lecture we looked at distributing over some expression and now we're
going to do the reverse of that we are going to factor expressions so we're going to start with
an expression and we're going to break it down into its constituent factors so our discussion
is going to be all about factoring factoring so last time as mentioned we talked about
expanding so we would have you know certain expressions that we want to expand this is just
the reverse of that we want to factor we want to go from something that we've expanded by using
distribution we want to now break it apart into its constituent parts again so let's put a little
line right under factoring and the first thing that we are going to talk about is we're going to talk
about polynomials polynomials so let's just define what a polynomial is and i'm going to write out
a polynomial just in terms of variables so there are many ways that you can write this but let's
have a subscript n and then we're going to have x to the power n plus now i'm going to just decrease
this n by 1 so n minus 1 so that i have x to the power n minus 1 as well plus we're going to go
8 and then the subscript 2 minus 1 and then x to the power n minus 2 and then we're going to go all
the way and so there's our little ellipses as we've had before and then i'm going to have a sub 2
x squared plus a sub 1 x to the power 1 and we usually don't put that and lastly we have a sub 0
and we have x to the power 0 which is 1 so we leave it there so that's an odd sort of notation
one thing that we do always want to have is that a sub n is not equal to 0 so we have these little
subscripts just to denote the fact that these are different values these are different values
variables and because we're using a a a all the time and we run out of letters for the alphabet
it's a very easy thing just to put subscripts there just to denote that that is a different
number from that or at least a different variable a different variable a different variable a different
variable the x remains the same that's the same variable and we're just raising it to a certain
power so if we start right at the back that would be x to the power 0 x to the power 1 x squared all
the way and you can count up until you get to x to the power n so let's have a little example
so let's have an example let's say 3 x to the power 4 plus 2 x to the power 3 plus let's have x squared
let's have plus 2 x let's have plus 4 and now you can see what's happening here here is my a sub 0 value
that's just 4 there's my a sub 1 which is 2 my a sub 2 which is just 1 so a sub 1 is 2 a sub 2 is 1
here's a sub 3 that's a 2 and there's a sub 4 which is 3 and then i just have corresponding to these
subscripts and remember that does nothing to the number that's just denoting that these are all different
values later on we'll call them coefficients we'll have a look at that but that just corresponds to the
power that we raise the variable by so that will be an example of a polynomial and usually we write
this descending order of this variable x and we do like this first coefficient a sub n in this instance
that would be a sub 4 not to be equal to 0 if that was 0 this term doesn't really exist because 0 times
anything is just 0 and then we just would have started right there at the a sub 3 so that's
important for us to know and so the subscript notation i that's really what we call call it a
counter in this instance we started counting at 0 and 1 2 3 and we go all the way up to n
and that's just a counter that we you know helps us keep track of these things but it just denotes
these different values so let's just define this idea of a coefficient so coefficient is this constant
that goes in front of the variable that we're raising to a certain power so all the a sub 4 a sub 3 a sub 2
a sub 1 or whatever my n value is just in decreasing order you can of course just write it the other way
round if i wanted to you'll see many different ways as i mentioned but these are all our coefficients
and we usually use a or b or c something to that order denoting that these will be
you know constant values and that is the way that we denote them and those are just those coefficients
i'm going to call them a sub i and that's why i wrote the i there these are all my i's now i say n
minus 1 n but i just means it's this counter that we're talking about this little counter at the
bottom the subscript does nothing to what the number really is just denoting that i can be 0
there's a 0 we're denoting i can be 1 there's my a sub 1 which in this instance is a 2 etc so those are
just going to be my coefficients we define something called the degree define something called the
degree of the polynomial by the way let's just keep track of all of these there is where i defined
my polynomial so let's keep that one in green and here's where i defined what a coefficient is
so please keep track of that one for me now we're going to be calling talking about the degree of a
polynomial so let's say degree of a polynomial polynomial and so by degree of a polynomial what
we mean is we definitely have to have that a subscript n is not equal to 0 then n is the degree
of the polynomial
and so let's look at an example very quickly let's go back to this example where we had 3x to the power
4 plus 2x to the power 3 plus x squared plus 2x plus 4 and indeed there's my n that is the highest
power that we went to as far as the variables power is concerned here we had x to the power 0 that's this
1 here we had x to the power 1 x squared x cubed x to the power 4 so the degree the degree of this
polynomial is equal to 4 it's a fourth degree polynomial so let's put another little green
marker there we have to find something called the degree of a polynomial now there's a couple of
polynomials of various degrees that we give names to and so the first one that we have is called the
quadratic polynomial so let's write that quadratic polynomial
polynomial and let's make a column just for the degrees that's a polynomial that's of degree
2 so we have something like x squared plus 4x plus 3 next thing we're going to have a cubic
polynomial polynomial and that will be of degree 3 and something like let's put 2x cubed plus 4x squared
minus 3x plus 2 we also get a higher order quartic a quartic polynomial so quadratic even though it says
quad we don't mean 4 by that a quartic is degree 4 and something like let's make it x to the power 4
minus 3 now can i have that yes because what we are saying in this instance instance is that x to
the power 3 has a coefficient of 0 x to the power 2 has a coefficient of 0 and then x has a coefficient
of 0 and then x to the power 0 has its coefficient 3 that's still the highest power that we have there
and that makes it a fourth order then we also get a quintic and there are names for higher order but i think
we can just stop there that'll be a polynomial of order 4 and so let's make it 3 to the power 5
i should say x to the power 5 plus now let let me do this let me write 0 x to the power 4 plus 0 x to the
power 3 plus let's make it x squared minus x plus 2 and you can see those will be 0 so this will just be
equal to 3 x to the power 5 plus x squared minus x plus 2 and so you needn't have these other powers
because their coefficient might be 0 as long as this what we call a leading coefficient so this is going
to be my leading coefficient let's put a line that's called my leading coefficient now that leading
coefficient as long as that is not equal to 0 in this instance in this example that'd be a sub 5
but that's not equal to 0 if that was 0 that would be 0 that'd be 0 0 and we'd end up right there there'll
be a second degree polynomial so it is the highest of these powers of our variable as long as the
coefficient is not equal to 0 and the leading is going to be that one that's attached to the
variable that is raised to the highest power so let's just make that another little definition
of ours now we're going to start factoring now that we have our definitions out of the way
let's factor some something that are you know fairly common to do let's say factor common
elements so what is common about certain terms in an expression common elements and so we're going
to start with something very simple and we're going to start with something we learned last
week distribution so imagine i had x and i multiplied that by x minus 3 now by distribution that's going
to be x times x and x times x minus 3 so let's have a look at that that's going to be x times x
which means x times x plus the x times the negative 3 so there'll be a negative 3 actually times the x
that's a 1 that's a 1 i'm multiplying the bases are the same i can add those 2 x 1 plus 1 and then the
positive times the negative would be negative 3 x and this would just be x squared minus 3 x so just a
little simple revision of last week so this is going to be x times x minus 3 and what we mean by factoring
is instead of going in this direction we're now going to go in this direction we're going to go from x squared
minus 3 x to its component terms you could say here or at least these parts of this expression
so there's one part of it and there's the second part so we are factoring it these are two factors
of our expression here this expression has two terms and if we factorize it we end up with these two
factors and so we're just going to go in reverse so how would we go about if we are given this example
problem let's do an example problem let's say we have x squared minus 3 x and we want to factorize
it and as i say this example is something about common elements what is common between these terms
in this expression and so let's just rewrite it as we had it right there that would be x times x minus
3 times x so if i look at these two different terms in this expression what is common to both of them
well there is certainly an x there and there's an x there this x here does not have a counterpart
in this term there's only a single x there so if i look at what is common between these two there's
only a single x that is common between these two and we say we take out that x this is a common term
that we use we take out that x we factor that x out what is left well if i've taken this one out
all that is left is here is an x if i took that one out all that is left there is a negative three
and now i've gone from this expression with its two terms and i have factorized it into its two
factors those are the two components that make up this expression and that is what we mean by taking
out or factoring out a common element here x was a common element between these two now let's look at
another example because it's not always the variable that is the common factor sometimes it's the
constant that's a common factor so let's look at this example i have six x squared plus nine y let's
factorize that but first of all let's just write it out in its constituent parts now remember we said
that every integer is the product of prime numbers so let's have a look quickly at six i'm going to divide
it by its smallest the smallest prime which is two and two indeed does divide six divides what we mean
by that is there's no remainder if i say six divided by two that's equal to three and the remainder is zero
so two now i've got a three left and three is a prime and so that is it six would be equal to two times
three those are both primes and that is prime factorization of the number six let's look at nine
we cannot divide two into nine because that'll be four with a remainder of one so that doesn't
work the next smallest prime is three that's great if i say nine divided by three i've got three left
now i'm going to divide three by the smallest prime which is two doesn't work next smallest prime is
three yes it does divide three does divide three without a remainder and there we see the prime
factorization of six and nine and now if i bring these down let's have a look at these
what is the only common factor so remember if i brought these down we'll have the least common
multiple but that's not what we want to do here we want to know what is common between these two
and certainly if i look here let's draw a little box here it is the three it's the only thing that is
common among these two so three would be a common factor i just as we factorize this expression here
we factorize this expression here we factorizing the constants and the only common one between them
would be the three so i can definitely factor out a three now look there's two x's and there's a y
there's nothing common between those two terms as far as x's and y are concerned so there's nothing i can
take out so that would be it so if i say six divided by three well there's a remainder of or there
it goes in three goes into six twice there's no remainder and then i have x squared and it goes
into nine three times so i'll have plus three y and now i factored this expression into its factors
the only common factor that i can take out between six x squared and nine y is the three that's the
only thing that's common between those two terms so as i mentioned that we can also think about
constants not only variables that can be taken out as common factor now let's have look at a
much nicer example because that'll bring everything home two one six let's make two and six x plus let's
make it 450 y and now can i factorize this now first of all we have to think let's think about the
variables there's an x here and a y there there's nothing common as far as the variables are concerned
between those two so again we left with the two constants so can we think about prime factorization
as far as these two are concerned so there are a couple of laws and you can see them if you do look
at the notes the description to the notes that would be available down in the description you can look at
those notes and there's a couple of laws here the easiest one to look at is to say that if we take
the largest number divided by the smallest number and we look at the remainder of that division
then we're going to look at only the remainder and the smallest of those two numbers the remainder and
the smallest of those two numbers so that's a very easy way a nice way to go about that and let's
just do a little bit of long division now this is of course just reviewing algebra we're not going
to do much arithmetic here so let's just remind ourselves how to do long division so that's 450
divided by 216 and if we do this long division what is left well first of all let's look at 216
in 450 that does not really go it does not go into four it doesn't go into 45 but it does go into 450
and it goes into 450 exactly twice so 6 times 2 is 12 I carry the 1 2 times 1 is 2 plus the 1 would be
a 3 and 2 times 2 is 4 and now I'm going to do subtraction and here we go I'm going to borrow there
so that becomes a 4 that becomes a 10 so I'm left with 8 and I've borrowed there so that becomes a 1
and I have a remainder of 18 so we can say 450 divided by 216 that is going to equal 2 with a remainder
of 18 and now we say the following if we look at these common multiples that we can take out
and we're going to call those this this um the largest of these common multiples that we can
take out we're going to talk about this remainder and the smallest of these two numbers so there's
my remainders 18 let's do prime factorization of that 18 can it divide 2 yes it can that's the
smallest prime that leaves me with a 9 can 9 be divided by 2 no what's the next prime is 3 yes it
can be divided by 3 so there's my 3 I've got 3 left can it be divided by 2 no next prime is 3 yes it can
be divided by 3 so that's what I have 18 if I do prime factorization that'll be 2 times 3 times 3
2 times 3 is 6 6 times 3 is 18 there we go let's look at 216 that's going to be a you know a little
bit more difficult can it divide 2 yes it can if I divide it by 2 what do I have left 108 can 108 be
divided by 2 yes it can and if I divide it by 2 I am left with 108 divided by 2 that'll be 54 can 54 be
divided by 2 yes it can so there's another 2 there's another 2 and now I'm left with 27 27 on the other
hand can be divided by 3 and that leaves me with 9 which is 3 times 3 and there we have this prime
factorization of 216 now what I want to do is I just want to write this in a slightly better way let's do
a 2 and a 3 and a 3 and a 3 and a 3 there we go that was the prime factorization of 18 that was the
prime factorization of 216 and let's look at what is common between these two if I wrote it in nice
columns look at this we have that two is common there we have that there's one three that is common
we have another three that is common and that's it this two does not have a mate this one doesn't
have and that three doesn't have so we've got two times three times three and two times three is six six
times three is 18 so indeed 18 is common to both of these it is common to both of these we call that
the greatest common divisor so if I take 18 and I divide it by 216 I take 18 divided by 450 that is
going to be the largest of all the numbers all the possible numbers that I can get that will divide
both 216 and 450 so let's do 216 and I'm going to divide that into 18 18 at least I'm going to divide
18 into 216 and you can do your long division or use a calculator you'll see that it's 12 and if I take
18 and I divide it into 450 if I divide it into 450 I'm going to get 25 so use your calculator and see
that that happens so see there's no remainder with these there's absolutely no remainder and so
by doing this prime factorization writing things neatly in order I can just see what is common
amongst those two and if I multiply that out that is going to give me something called the greatest
common divisor that's the greatest number that divides both of those and so if you can read the
notes and you can go through one of these techniques that gives us this number so 18 is going to be my
common factor and I know that it's going to be 12 times x plus 25 times y and that is the way the
only way that I can properly factor 216 x plus 450 y is discovering this greatest common divisor the
greatest number that will divide both 216 and 450 and as I say if you want to do this by hand and not
use something like python to do this for you which is very very easy this is the way that I would go
about it take the smallest number divided into the biggest number so 450 divided by 216 and look at
what the remainder is now you're going to take the smallest of these two numbers and the remainder
and you're going to do between those two you're going to do prime factorization and then you're going to
see what is common between those two there's a two that is common but there's no two there there's
no two there there's one three one three but there's no three there so these were the only
common values you multiply them out you're going to get 18 and that is the greatest common divisor
of 216 and 450. let's continue our discussion we're going to do one more example now this example is going
to be easier because as I mentioned the last one was kind of the most difficult one you will get when
you want to factorize or at least get the greatest common divisor of two integers and the larger they
get I really want to suggest that you take a look at the python videos and learn how to do that using
a computer language it's just so much easier so let's do this one let's have 6x squared plus 9 times x times
y we want to factor those so let's factor each of these six when we do prime factorization would be
2 times 3 that's a prime that's a prime 2 times 3 is 6 I can't factor this any further x squared can
be factored I can write x times x and then I have a plus there 9 can be factored into 3 times 3 that's
the prime factorization of 9 then I have a times x and I have a times y let's look at what is common
between these two these two terms there's a 2 on this side there's no 2 there there's a single 3 there
there's a 3 there there's an x here and there's an x there but there's no other x if I look at this
3 yes it has its corresponding 3 on the side but the other 3 doesn't have a partner on the side
there's the x's they have a partner but this y doesn't have a partner so what is common between
those two are the 3 and the x and I can take those out as my common factor what is left behind well if
I've taken the 3 and the x out the 3 and the x what is left on this side well 2 times x 2 times x and
here we have 3 times y 3 times y and we have factorized now once again if you do distribution
you're just going to get back 6x squared plus 9xy so you can always check your work and so those would
be examples of just taking a common factor and factoring that out of an expression
now the next thing I want to talk to you about is factoring so let's write factoring
let's do quadratic quadratic expressions
in quadratics those are second order polynomials so let's have a sub 2 x squared plus a sub 1 x
remember there's a little one there and a sub 0 and there's an x sub 0 but that's just 1
and we also have to have that a sub n is not equal to 0 if and by a sub n here we mean
the 2 a sub 2 if that was 0 and this term would fall away and then be a first order polynomial
but it's a second order polynomial because this a sub n which is a sub 2 in our instance for
quadratic equations or second order polynomials would you know you can't have that 0
so let's consider an example so we want to factor the following let's have x squared
plus let's do 5x and let's do plus 6 so what do we have here it's second order my a sub 2 which is
right there or a sub n right there that's just equal to 1 so it's not 0 I have my variable the highest
power would be there's also an x sub 0 they remember would be 2 this makes it a second order polynomial
or a quadratic expression now quadratic expressions they are always going to have two factors
and because we do distribution that'll be an x and that'll be an x and we just have to figure out
which number goes here and which number goes there and through distribution I mean x times x is x squared
so we're going to have the x squared there but if I have a look at this constant times that constant
I better get to 6 so how can I get 6 if I multiply two numbers because I'm going to have that number
multiplied by that number how can I get a 6 well let's have a look I can do 6 times 1 I can do
negative 6 times negative 1 I can do 1 times 6 I can do negative 1 times negative 6 I can do 2 times 3
I can do negative 2 times negative 3 I can do 3 times 2 and I can do negative 3 times negative 2
all of those will give me 6 so this is not prime factorization I'm just looking at if I multiply two
integers how do I get to 6 well those would be the integers that I can multiply with each other to give
me 6 and so let's see if we plug these in on this side whether we get to this expression so let's try
plus 6 and plus 1 because I'm going to get x squared there and I'm going to get plus 6 there but what
about this 5x so what we have to consider is those multiplications that distribution so here I'm going
to get x plus 6x and that equals 7x and that's not what I want I want 5x so I know I can remove this
one from my list my list of possibilities now exactly the same thing think about is going to happen if I
have negative 6 and negative 1 if I have negative 6 and negative 1 I'm still going to have 6 at the end
negative 6 times negative 1 gives me positive 6 but I'm going to have negative 6x and negative 1x which
is going to give me negative 7x that one's also not going to work and the same is going to apply to
those two and so let's start with the 2 by 3s let's have a look at those and I'm going to still have an x
there I'm going to have an x there and let's have a look let's start with 2 and 3 so I'm going to have
positive 2 and positive 3 now I'm still going to have x times x is x squared so I get that one
I have 2 times 3 which is 6 so let's look at multiplying these two so I'm going to have
x times 3 that's going to be 3x and 2 times x that's going to be positive 2x and lo and behold if I
add three apples and another two apples I get five apples and that's exactly what I want and so
x plus 2 and x plus 3 is going to be the factorization of that second order polynomial
and you can check on that now look at these the way that I've you know done my distributions but
remember we usually do it this way those two and these two but that's the same as doing it this way
around nothing that's that's no different those two ways of thinking about it so I'm still going
to have x squared plus x times 3 that's 3x and here 2 plus 2 times x that's positive 2x and then 2 times
3 which is 6 so there right there in the middle I still have my 3x and 2x so it doesn't matter which
way around I do this I still get the same solution and that gives me 5x which is exactly what I want
so this was going to be the selection and by the way 2 and 3 and 3 and 2 where they put the 3 and
the 3 there and the 2 there that was also going to work for me we have the commutative property of
multiplication so I could have x plus 2 times x plus 3 or x plus 3 times x plus 2 so this one was also
going to work for me let's do another one the more of these you do as always the better it's going to
be for you mathematics is not a sport a spectator sport it's a participation sport let's do x squared
minus let's do minus x let's do minus 6 and so it is a polynomial I'm going to have two factors and
I'm the first ones are going to be x times x to get me x squared now I just have to think how to get
negative 6 what do I multiply to give me negative 6 well this time around let's start with saying
negative 6 times positive 1 or 6 times negative 1 or negative 1 times 6 or 1 times negative 6
and then I can also have negative 2 times 3 or 2 times negative 3 I can get 3 times 2 and I can also
well that's going to be let's make this negative 3 times 2 and 3 times negative 2 all the all these
8 multiplications are all going to give me negative 6 so let's start with that very first one let's do
a negative 6 and there a positive 1 positive 1 so let's have a look at this again remember I'm going to
get my x squared here and I'm going to get my negative 6 from there let's see what happens with these
two x times positive 1 that's going to give me x and here I'm going to have negative 6x minus 6x that
gives me minus 5x that equals minus 5x that's not what I want I want a negative x so surely this first
one does not work at all that one does not work at all and let's think about some of the others which
ones are going to work for us well let's try the second one let's try a 6 a positive 6 and a negative
1 do you think that one's going to work if I have positive 6 I'm going to have a positive 6x minus 6
that's going to give me positive 6 minus 1 that gives me a positive 5x it's certainly still not what
I want and you can work through all of these the 6 times 1s with the different signs none of them
are going to work let's try this one negative 2 and 3 so let's go for this one x and an x let's try
negative 2 and positive 3 now you can immediately see that's not going to work we need a negative 1
and if we look at this if we have positive 3x minus 2x that leaves us with a positive x that's
not what we want so this one's not going to work either and the one that's going to obviously work
is this one let's have a look at that one let's do x plus 2 and x minus 3 now let's just do our normal
distribution and let's go straight for that and you'll see it does work indeed so x times x would
be x squared I have negative 3x that's the x times the negative 3 2 times x is positive 2x
and as we had plus 2 times negative 3 that is going to give us negative 6 so we do have our x squared and
we do have our negative 6 that's where we always start it's about this middle term and indeed negative
negative 3x positive 2x gives me negative x and I have x squared minus x minus 6 which is exactly my
problem and so this would be the correct one that would definitely be the correct one now of course
there is commutativity so I could also have x minus 3x plus 2 but certainly you just need to write it in
one you know one of the solutions here and that absolutely works so if you look carefully
we have the two factors we have x and x then we think about this value here that would be our a sub
zero in this instance would be a negative 6 here our a sub zero was positive 6 and we just have to
think how can we get that that gives us these last two terms but there's many ways to get negative 6
many multiplication of two integers is going to give me negative 6 and I have to choose the right
combination such that if I think about these two terms the outside and the inside distribution
that if I add them that I get what I want which in this instance was a negative 1
now I need not have that my leading coefficient is equal to just 1 let's have a look at this example
I'm going to have 2x squared plus 7x plus 3 now that is a wholly different beast in as much as my
leading coefficient here is not equal to 1 this is still a second order polynomial or quadratic expression
and so let's see if we can factor this we know this is a polynomial so we're going to definitely have
two terms but now I have to get 2x when I multiply these first two terms when I multiply these two
terms I must get 2x squared so certainly this has to be a 2x and that one is an x such that if I do
that multiplication I get I did 2x squared which is 2x squared now I have to think how can I get positive
3 positive 3 would be my a sub zero term as positive 3 so let's think how we can get this we can get
this as 3 times 1 we can get this as negative 3 times negative 1 we can get this as 1 times 3 we can
get this as negative 1 times negative 3 so certainly as far as integers go that would be the multiplication
now it's not always going to work out like this we might you know get fractions that we need to
consider but those would be more advanced cases in this lecture we're only thinking about you know a
systematic way of going about factoring these polynomial expressions so let's start with this
first one that would be a positive 3 and a positive 1 so positive 3 and a positive 1 and so if I do this
multiplication there this distribution 3 times 1 gives me a positive 3 that's correct and the 2x times x
gives me the 2x squared let's have a look at what happens to my inner term if I do that distribution
so 2x times positive 1 that's going to give me 2x plus 3x plus 3x that gives me 5x and definitely that
is not going to work for me the 3 times 1 let's remove it that is not going to work so let's choose
negative 3 and negative 1 so I'll go through the motions I'm going to get 2x there and I'm going to get
an x there let's go negative 3 and negative 1 so I am now I'm definitely going to get the first term
and I'm definitely going to get the last term that's how I set it up so I'm going to get 2x squared
and I'm going to get a positive 3 so let's look at this middle term I'm going to get 2x times negative
1 that's negative 2x and negative 3 times x that gives me negative 3x and that gives me negative 5x
and that's not what I want I want positive 7x so definitely those two were not going to work
let's have a look at let's have a look at this next on my list I've still got my 2x and I've still got
my x and now I've got positive 1 and positive 3 now again 2x times x is going to give me 2x squared
the 1 times 3 is going to give me 3 so I certainly do have the first term and the last term let's again
here I'm going to have 6x plus 1x gives me 7x 6x plus 1x that equals 7x and that's exactly what I
want the 7x so my solution is indeed 2x plus 1 times x plus 3 and you can go about that just in the way
that we've always gone about it when we do this distribution but doing it this way or this way is
exactly the same you're going to get 2x squared plus 6x plus 1x plus 3 and the 6x plus 1x gives me a 7x
so I'm going to get 2x squared plus 7x plus 3 and I've got the right solution there is my factorization
of this quadratic expression as I said before we definitely cannot get enough of these so let's do
another example I'm going to do 2x squared minus 5x minus 12 now again that's a more difficult one
because I don't have a leading coefficient that is 1 it's still a second order polynomial or quadratic
expression so I know that I'm going to get these two terms and there's my two terms now I have to
think about how do I get negative 12 now there are many ways to get negative 12 and you've got to start
I think after doing quite a few of these start doing this in your head and you've got to think
if there are two things that I multiply by each other to get 12 which one of those pairs is going
to get me close to a negative 5 and certainly if I think about 6 and 2 well 6 and 2 6 times 2 is 12
but the difference between 6 and a 2 is a 4 so that's not going to really help that's not really
going to help me what if I think about a 3 and a 4 now I have to remember that I also have to bring
this 2 into it and that's what makes life very difficult I'm starting to think though that if I
mix a 3 and a 4 a 3 let's think about it 3 and a 4 but I've also got to multiply one of them by a 2
and if I multiply this by a 2 I get 8 and from 8 and 3 yes if I could get 8 a negative 8 and a positive
3 that will give me to 5 so I think the 3 and the 4s are perhaps going to work for me so to get
negative 12 let's think about it the first thing that I can think about is 3 times negative 4
let's try those ones positive 3 and negative 4 now that's exactly what I had in mind because I said
there's my 8 and there's my 3 and there is a way to use 8 and 3 to get to 5 especially negative 5 if I
had a negative 8 and a positive 5 that is going to a positive 3 that's going to give me a negative 5
and there I have my negative 8 and my positive 3 there we go negative 8x positive 3x is going to give me
negative 5 so this is absolutely the solution so let's have a look at that just to make sure that
that works 2 times 2x times x is going to give me 2x squared and now I'm going to have the negative 8x
I'm going to have the positive 3x and I'm going to have the negative 12 so I'm going to have 2x squared
minus 5x minus 12 so you have to start thinking in your head you know how can I get close to negative
5 what of these numbers if I have a 2 there and I'm thinking of getting negative 12 what of the
numbers that I multiply to give me negative 12 can I possibly use to get me to a negative 5
and the 6 and the 2 wasn't really going to work for me but definitely the 3 and the 4 if I could get to
this stage as I mentioned now you can still write out all of the ways that you can get to negative 12
and you can go through all of them but after you've done a few of these I want you just to start thinking
it through in your head without having to write down all the possible values in the beginning though
please write them all out
let's do one more example and let's make this one let's make it 40x squared let's do minus 40x
let's do minus 240 and that's a still a second order polynomial degree 2 polynomial or quadratic
expression my leading coefficient here is not 0 and the highest power of my variable x is 2
and what I can see here is immediately that I can factor out one of these I can factor out
you know looking at these coefficients a 40 a negative 40 and a 240 what if I do it just to
take 40 out as a common factor I am left with x squared minus x and minus 6 x squared minus x minus 6
if I were to distribute 40 into this expression here I'm definitely going to get 40x squared minus 40x minus 240
and now all that is left is x squared minus x minus 6 we have seen that before we're going to get 40
there's going to be my x term there's going to be an x now I just have to think how can I get
to negative 6 such that I can think of getting to a negative 1 and certainly that is going to be
a negative 3 and a positive 2 that's going to give me the negative 6 but negative 3x positive 2x gives me
negative x and that was a simple simple example where you just have to think about first simplifying
your polynomial by looking at what is common amongst these common amongst these coefficients
and we're looking for the greatest common divisor so 40 goes into 40 once 40 goes into 40 once and 40 goes
into 246 times and I just have to remember what the signs are now that is very exciting but now let's move on
to building you know the building blocks in a later chapter we're going to build on what we have now
but I want to talk to you about the difference difference between squares and so we talk about
these as perfect squares and what we have is x squared minus a squared and that's a square and that's a
square and a difference now remember what we are talking about here is ax squared plus let's do bx plus c
before I did a sub 2 x squared plus a sub 1 x sub you know to the power 1 plus a sub 0 but you may also
see this in the textbook so a sub 2 is this a a sub 1 is b a sub 0 is c the subscript is just about you
know making you aware of the fact that these are different values different coefficients but what we have
here is that this term right here is equal to a squared and with a negative out front a sub 1 here is
equal to 0 times x and here we have that a sub 1 is equal to 1 and here I have an x squared so this is
what we mean by x squared that's a zero term minus a squared just so happens that this plus a sub 0 is
equal to negative a squared there we go negative a squared so the middle term there is not represented
and these are very very easy to factor and they are easy to factor in as much as we're going to have
x minus a and x plus a why is that so well x times x that's my x squared and there's my negative a times
positive a there's my negative a squared but look what happens to these two terms I have positive a x
negative a x and if I add positive a x plus negative a x I get 0 x and so that middle term is gone
let's have a look at let's have a look at an example let's have x squared minus 25 now is that a
difference between squares most definitely but please do remember this is x squared plus 0 x minus 25
it's just that that coefficient there is 0 so we don't even put it there and let's rewrite this I
can rewrite this as x squared minus 5 squared because 5 squared 5 squared if I just look at that 5 squared is
25 and there's a square and there's a square so these are going to be exceedingly easy to do there's my x
minus 5 and my x positive 5 so I'm taking the negative of this number and the positive of this number
there's my five there's my five there's my five the negative and the positive version of that
because if I multiply negative five times positive five I get negative 25 but here I have positive 5x
minus 5x those cancel out and we're left with zero
let's do another example in this example I'm going to do 25 x squared let's make it minus 81 y squared
is this the difference between squares yes because I can write 25 is 5 squared x squared minus 81 I can
write as 9 squared y squared and now I just have to remember if I have a to the power n times b to the
power n that is just going to equal a times b to the power n so I have the same power there's an n
there's a 2 and a 2 so I can just multiply these two by each other that will be a 5x and I'm squaring
that minus and the same is going to happen here I've got 9y and I'm squaring that now I'm thinking
of this as one term this is one term I have the square of this term minus the square of that term
and lo and behold I can do what we've had way up here so I just have to remember that it looks
different from this but it is still the square of something minus the square of something the
square of something minus the square of something so this first one is 5x is my first something
and now I have to have minus the other one and 5x plus the other one and so there's my one term
and there's my other term whereas here I had my one term and my other term here we go it's going
to be this whole term minus this whole term and this whole term plus that whole term so you can
clearly see here the middle term if I look at these two they are going to cancel out and all I'm left
with are these two terms and if you multiply them out you're going to get 25x squared minus 81y squared
good let's have a look at some more there is the difference difference between cubes
and so what we're going to have here is something like let's make it a cubed minus b cubed
and this would be a if this was an x I would think of this as being a third order polynomial
and there is a very nice way that we can factorize this this is going to be a minus b and then I'm
going to have a squared plus a b plus b squared and this second term cannot be factored and we can't
have any factorization of the second term so let's have a look at an example let's have something like
let's do 8x to the power 3 minus 27 now once again remember this is 8x to the power 3 plus 0x squared
plus 0 times x minus 27 and so that term is 0 that term is 0 and I'm just left with the difference
between these two and so when we write it like this do not get confused the only thing we're trying
to show here is that we have something that is cubed minus something else that is cubed this instance
I'm writing an example as a polynomial it's a third degree polynomial this leading coefficient is not
zero so it's a degree 3 or third order or a cubic expression now let's rewrite this I've got
2 to the power 3 is 8 times x to the power 3 minus 3 to the power 3 3 times 3 is 9 9 times 3 is 27
and I just have to remember just as we had before if I have any number to the power n and another
number to the power n and I'm multiplying those I can rewrite this as a times b to the power n so I'm
going to do the same here I've got 2x to the power 3 minus 3 to the power 3 can you see I have the
difference between two cubes the difference between two cubes and this instance if I just look at a's
and b's there's my a is going to be 2x and my b is going to equal 3 positive 3 because that negative is
right there I'm just looking at the b part and that is my 3 now I can look at this so I'm going to say a
minus b which is going to be 2x minus b which is negative 3 and then I'm going to have this term
so I'm going to have a squared that's going to be 4x squared plus a times b so plus 2x times 3 that
gives me 6x and then b squared which is 3 squared which is positive 9 and that is the factorization
of 8x cubed minus 27 and once again this part I cannot factorize there is no way that I can write
this as you know two factors now there's a sum or this let's do sum of and let's make that sum of
let's just say cubes and in other words I have a to the power 3 plus b to the power 3 and it turns out
there's a nice way to factorize this as well it's going to be a plus b instead of the negative and
here we're going to have a squared minus ab plus b squared once again this cannot be factored any further
so let's look at a nice example let's do the same let's do 27 let's do 27 x to the power 3 plus 8
can I rewrite this yes 27 is 3 to the power 3 times x to the power 3 plus 8 can be written as 2 to the
power 3 I remember the rule that I had there so I can write this as 3 times x to the power 3 plus 2 to
the power 3 and what do I have I have a cube plus another cube exactly what I have there so in this
instance a is going to equal 3x and b is going to equal 2 and so now I can just use this factorization
so a plus b would be 3x plus 2 and I have a squared would be 3x squared 3 squared is 9 x squared is x squared
minus a times b minus 3x times 2 that's 6x and then plus b squared so plus and b is 2 2 squared is 4
and once again we can't factorize that and that would be the solution factoring this sum of cubes
so look at the difference between these two cubes and the sum of these look at how these are done and
please do not get confused between there's a negative b there negative 27 so the negative is
there and I just have to look at the 27 all on its own so that's going to be 3 cubed and now the very
last bit of this foundational work in factorization is we're going to think about factoring rational
expressions
factoring rational expressions now what do we mean by rational expression that we're going to have
is a polynomial polynomial divided by a polynomial so let's have a look at an example let's have
2x squared plus 7x let's make it plus 6 and we're going to divide that into x squared minus 4
divide into that I should say x squared minus 4 so that is our example I'm taking a polynomial
divide by another polynomial and let's do some factorization let's factorize the numerator
and we're going to factorize the denominator so this is another technique or the last technique for
this lecture that I want you to be aware of so definitely here we're going to have a 2x and here
we're going to have an x and we have to think about how do we get how on earth do we get to 7
now hopefully if you can you know if you think about it let's think if we if we have somehow if we
have a 3 getting to a 6 3 times 2 if we have a 3 and we have a 4 and I can make a 7 from a 3 and a 4
specifically if I have plus 3 there and I have plus 2 there so that I have positive 6 there's my positive
6 but if I look at 4x plus 3x I get to 7x so once again you can write all these down go through them
one by one but start thinking about doing these in your head here I have x squared minus 2 squared
that's the difference between two squares and I know how to do this that is going to be x minus 2 x plus 2
do remember not use the 4 not use the 4 here you have to write that 4 as a square and the negative
stands all on its own so I just want to think about this 4 writing it somehow as a square and of course
2 squared just this all on its own 2 squared is equal to 4 and now I have the difference between two
squares so here I can put x minus 2 and x plus 2 and we'll remember from any kind of simple algebra
is that if I have multiplication numerator multiplication in the denominator here's one term
multiplied by another or one expression multiplied by another expression one expression multiplied by one
expression I can think about starting to cancel and lo and behold I have an x plus 2 and an x plus 2
so I can think about if I have x plus 2 in the numerator and exactly the same thing in the
denominator those can cancel and I'm left with 1 over 1 which is just 1 so those two have cancelled
and all I'm left with are these two so that's going to be 2x plus 3 and I'm going to have oops I'm going
to have x minus 2 so I've gone from a difficult expression here to something that's a much simpler
by making use of factorization so what we've seen in this last example for this lecture is how can I
make factorization work for me how can it be useful and here we've seen a beautiful example of how it can
be useful this would be difficult and this would be a lot easier to do
