In this video we are going to have a quick chat about the diffraction grating.
And what that entails is tiny little slits.
Thousands of tiny little slits.
So instead of a double slit or a single slit
through which we can get interference patterns
we now have thousands of slits.
And through different production methods
thousands of slits can be made per centimeter.
And it is usually indicated as lines per centimeter or slits per centimeter.
As a diffraction grating.
Now I said before in one of the blackboard videos
that we have to be very careful how we assign our value M.
I just want to remind you back at the single slit diffraction pattern
where we calculated through our diagram
the first destructive interference dark band.
And we saw how if we had these three lines
and that the screen was sufficiently far away
that we could see these initial rays as being parallel.
we noticed that this bottom ray traveled
a distance of one wavelength
further than the top one
and this middle one a half
making these two
the middle one and the bottom one
half a wavelength out of phase
causing the destructive interference.
And then if we moved up
from the bottom one
both of them equidistance
half a value of W
up, up, up, up, up
each successive ray up
would totally destructively interfere
with one in the bottom half.
And remember if we had four
we could do two times
for the bottom one
we'd look at the second order
and we could basically divide this width into four
and four successive two at the bottom
and two at the top
would destructively interfere.
And through trigonometry we saw our equation
for the different orders of destructive interference
the dark fringes
as the sine of theta equaling m times lambda
divided by the width.
Now with the diffraction grating
we are going back to essentially what we had
in the double slit experiment
Young's double slit experiment
in where we're not going for the destructive dark bands
here again we are going for the constructive bright bands
or called maxima
and we do it in exactly the same way basically
by looking at two slits
knowing full well now that there are thousands of slits
but let's look at two slits
and if we look at the
there will again be a bright band in the middle
as there was with a single slit
with a double slit and the diffraction grating as well
we'll have your center bright band
we'll look at these later
then you'll have your higher order bright bands
the first one of which is your first order bright band
for constructive interference
so we are looking at our equation
by setting up the first bright band
so it's only with a single slit
that we set up the first minima
or dark band
and again we're going to have these two wavelengths travel
in essence parallel
but if you look at the total distance
the bottom one is going to travel one wavelength further
than the top one
we're putting it out of phase by one wavelength
which means it's still totally in phase
so for your first order
what we call principal
higher order
bright band
is going to have
this constructive pattern
the second one
you'll notice that theta is more
all the lines are further up
theta is less acute
it's opening up
the difference between the travel
of two successive ones
are two times the wavelength
meaning they're still in phase
when they get to the board
and you'll have constructive interference again
so once again
where the distance between them is d
just as in the double slit experiment
we are going to have
that the sine of theta there
is going to be opposite
divided by hypotenuse
but we have to put in the m
for the higher orders
first order
second order
third order
times lambda
divided by d
the distance between
two successive slits
so in essence we have
much the same equation
or much the same setup
as we had with Young's
double slit experiment
just to show you
if you do see pictures
in your textbooks
if you graph light intensity
and in the center you'll have
the principal
zero
zero width
order
maxima
and at the bottom here
is for a double slit
so diffraction grating
double slit
I haven't drawn a single slit here
so you'll see on the diffraction grating
that these
bright bands
are first of all they narrower
and you have
these small waves
bright bands
in between
now
these normal
top ones are called
principal maxima
and these tiny little ones
are called
secondary maxima
the central one
is your zeroth
order
principal maxima
and to the left
and to the right
you get
your higher order
principal maxima
of first order
second order
etc
in the double slit
you'll note
that these
maxima
are much broader
they are not
as well defined
as in the
diffraction grating
one last thing to note
also is
if you have a larger number
of slits
your secondary maxima
become a lot smaller
so just making more slits
is going to get rid of
these smaller
secondary maxima
now
let's do an example problem
where we can actually
look at one of the useful
ways in which
a diffraction grating
can be used
and that is through
a grating spectroscope
because imagine what happens
if I shine white light
into my diffraction
let's have
on the two ends of the spectrum
let's have
the wavelength of violet light
as
let's make it
410 nm
and then
at the red end
opposite end
of the spectrum
the much longer
wavelength
let's take that
to be
660 nm
and I put it through
a diffraction grating
that has
lines per centimeter
of 1.0
0
times
10 to the power of 4
lines
per centimeter
that is
how most of these
are
expressed
now
can I convert this
into
deciding
what
the
first
order
principal
bright bands
or principal maxima
are going to be
and for obvious reasons
you are going to see
this is the double slit experiment
that the red light
the red light
is going to
diffract more
than the violet light
and as much as
lambda is in the numerator
and the arc sign then
of a larger fraction
is going to give you
a larger angle
first of all
just let's look
remind ourselves
of the equation
that we're dealing with
we are dealing with
a diffraction grating
so the sign of this angle
is going to be
m
times lambda
divided by d
the distance between
two successive lines
now
what do we know
we do know
that m equals
1
because we are asked
for the first order
principle
maxima
first order
bright fringes
or the very first
bright fringe
other than the central
bright band
so m equals 1
I've got to convert
I don't have d
I have lines per centimeter
but I need centimeter
per line
now just very carefully
look at how we can
convert this
simple
1.00
times 10 to the power
negative 4
over 1
that is lines
lines
per centimeter
but I want to express
centimeters
per line
so this is going to be
1 over
1.00
times 10 to the power
negative 4
that is going to be
centimeters
per line
that is what I've done
now
I've switched my
units around
switched my units around
so I get centimeters
per line
now I just need to
convert this
to meters
per line
and
so 1 meter
equals
100 centimeters
so the centimeters
will cancel out
and I am left with
1.00
times 10 to the power
negative 6
meters
per line
now that line
is not actually
now that line
is not actually
is not actually
a
unit
it's like
radians
for instance
so this was just
per centimeter
and I've now converted
it into meters
so I know what
d is
is 1.00
times 10 to the power
negative 6
meters
right
now we can
we can
express
our equation
there
in terms of theta
that will just be
the arc sign
of then
m is 1
and lambda
let's do
for violet
for violet
is then going to be
410
times 10 to the power
negative 9 meters
and I divide
all of that
by d
which is 1.00
times 10 to the power
negative 6 meters
and I get an answer
of
let me have a look
violet light
I get
24 degrees
24 degrees
I can't remember
what exactly
let's just make
as if this was
two significant digits
I've forgotten
what the rest was
if I do
lambda for red
and I can expect
that this obviously
is going to be
a lot more
and as much as
my numerator
gets a lot
larger
this is going to be
the arc sign then
of
660 times 10 to the power
negative 9
leaving out
the 1
meters
divided by
1.00 times 10 to the power
negative 6 meters
and for theta
red
I get
41.3
so let's make it
41 degrees
so the whole spectrum
what you're going to see
at this first order
is you're going to see
the whole spectrum
going out
in reverse
you're going to get
violet
indigo
blue
green
and your yellow
and your orange
and your red
going to be
further out
right in the center
you're going to get
white because
all of the colors
overlap there
and you will see
white
the colors are going
to overlap
at the first
second third
I mean the worse
the further it goes
the more they're going
to overlap
and you're going to see
a mixing of colors
so you're not going
to see the pure colors
but certainly looking
at them individually
you are going to see
the colors spread out
from the diffraction
grating
what we do want to
note though
is
I can now use
an instrument
where I look
at light coming in
through my diffraction
and I look
at a microscope
through a microscope
on this side
you know
with my eye
on this side
and
I can
vary the angle
here
so I can see
when I hit violet
or whatever the
the
the
color is
and through that
angle
I can work out
I can see what color
I'm seeing
first of all
and I can work out
then the angle
so we can
we know the angle
then we can work out
what the wavelength is
and figure out
what the wavelength
of different colors are
and also if we have
an unknown
we can
we can
have various atoms
produce this color
and we can see
through the diffraction
grating
what the emission lines
are of that
atom
and if we then
have an unknown
light source
for instance
some unknown star
we can look
at the different
and we can
or this diffraction
pattern
will then
or the
diffraction
grating pattern
will then give us
a different light
as it gets
broken up
by this diffraction
pattern
and we can see
we can work out
which wavelengths
are being
emitted
by that source
by that source
