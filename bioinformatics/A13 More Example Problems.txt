Now it's good for us to get some examples done. Here we have a matrix A being a 3 by 3 matrix,
so we at least get to have three item values, some of them which might be repeat, some of them which
might be complex numbers. Let's have a look. Let's first of all, and there's so many ways you can go
about this, but let's call our matrix C, something new I'm doing, minus lambda I, and that is going
to be this 3 minus lambda, we have negative 1, negative 1, we have 1, 1 minus lambda, and negative
1, and we have 1 minus 1, and 1 minus lambda. That's our new matrix C. Now we want the determinant
of matrix C to equal 0, so the determinant of matrix C. Well, good thing to do these kind
of examples because there's so many things you can review. How do you get the determinant
of a 3 by 3 matrix? Let's decide on a row or column to go along. It looks to me like column
1 would be the easiest because we have a positive 1 and a positive 1 there. Just remember that
that this turns out to be positive, negative, positive. Our co-matrix there. And so, what
are we going to have? We're going to have 3 minus lambda, and then we're going to have
these two multiplied and minus those two multiplied, so it looks like 1 minus lambda squared minus
negative 1, negative 1 is plus 1, so that is there. And this becomes a negative. Now I
take out this row and this column, so I'm left with this. It's a negative 1 multiplied by
a 1 minus lambda. And from that, remember this row and this column is gone, so again, minus
negative 1, negative 1, negative 1 is positive 1, so minus a 1 there. This is now a positive,
so that remains. And this row goes, this column goes, so it's those two minus those two. That
looks like a 1. That's a negative 1, but it's minus negative 1, so that becomes plus. This
one, 1 minus 1 minus lambda, and that has got to equal 0. That's got to equal 0, and you
can well imagine how easy it is to make a mistake somewhere along the line. If I haven't already
done so, we'll see. So this remains 3 minus lambda. This is going to become 1 minus 2 lambda
plus lambda plus lambda squared minus 1. And what do we have here? A negative. So here
we're going to have lambda minus 1 minus 1. And here we're going to have plus 2 minus lambda
equals 0. So those two will cancel out. So I have 3 minus lambda. Now you can do these
many fewer steps that I've just done here. Lambda squared minus 2 lambda. And here we're going
to have negative 2, so that becomes a positive 2 minus lambda. Another positive 2 minus lambda.
That's going to equal 0. Let's do this quickly. So that's going to be a 3 lambda squared.
It's going to be a negative 6 lambda. That is going to be a positive lambda.
And where am I going? See? Told you. Negative lambda cubed. Positive 2 lambda. And here we're
going to have a positive 4 and a minus 2 lambda being 0. And that leaves us with a negative lambda
cubed. So that one goes. I'm left with a positive 3. And let's see. It looks like I lost the lambda
one way. Let's just redo the step. I'll tell you. So easy. And this is typical of me anyway.
3 lambda squared minus 6 lambda. We've got this negative lambda cubed. Negative positive 2 lambda
squared. There was my mistake. So that's positive. 2 plus 2 is 4. Negative 2 lambda equals 0. So I have negative lambda cubed still for that one. And 3 plus 2 is 4. So I have negative lambda cubed.
Still for that one. And 3 plus 2 is 5. Plus 5 lambda squared. Negative 6. And is that negative 6 lambda? This is 3. Negative 6 lambda. So that makes it negative 8 lambda. For those 2. And I'm left with a for those 2. And I'm left with a positive 4 equals 0. So in the end I can multiply 3 out of the
negative. So I'm left with a negative. So I'm left with that minus that plus that minus that. And we've got to factor that out. So let's do that. Let's just leave. Let's just leave ourselves.
Let's just leave ourselves. Let's just leave ourselves that. Let's just leave ourselves that. So we've got to factor that out. And let's try lambda minus 1. Let's start there. And we're going to write that down.
so we've got to factor that out
and let's try lambda minus 1
let's start there
and we're going to write that as lambda 3
minus 5 lambda squared
plus 8 lambda minus 4
let's try that one out
lambda squared
that gives me lambda 3 minus lambda squared
that gives me a negative 4 lambda squared
plus 8 lambda
that is minus 4 lambda there
which gives me negative 4 lambda squared
plus
is that right
have I got the right one
I'm going to pause the video to scheme this board
because I've got to make sure
that this is not incorrect
ok apologies for that
I couldn't find any mistake anyway
so let's carry on
it's 4
so that leaves me 0
that leaves me 4 lambda
I bring down a negative 4
which just looks like a positive 4 there
that looks good
4 lambda minus 4
which is nothing left
so I can factor that out as well
so it seems I'm going to have
a lambda minus 1
and a lambda
if I factor that out
that's lambda minus 2 squared
and that equals 0
so I can see I have repeated eigenvalues
repeated eigenvalues
so my choice of lambda minus 1
as the first one worked out quite well
ok so I have lambda sub 1
let's do a little bit more
I have lambda sub 1
equals 1
and I have lambda sub 2
equals lambda sub 3
equals 2
let's start with that
because I now have to find out
whether I have just a single eigenvector
or whether I have multiple eigenvectors
so let's do that here
so if lambda equals 2
so a minus
so a minus lambda 2
or lambda 3i
that is going to equal
3 minus 2 is 1
I'm going to have negative 1
negative 1
I'm going to have 1
and then 1 minus 2
is negative 1
negative 1
I'm going to have 1
negative 1
1 minus 2 is negative 1
so that
and I've got to multiply that
so k1
k2
and k3
and you're going to see
that's all going to be the same
in other words
k sub 1
equals k sub 2
plus
k sub 3
if I do that multiplication
so it's always going to be like that
ok
and I can see two fundamental ways to write this
if I let this equal to 1
and this equal to 0
I'm going to get a k sub 1
which is going to equal 1
1 0
but I can also let this be 0
and this be 1
so I'm immediately going to have two distinct eigenvectors
and so that's going to be 1 0 or 1
so I've got these those two
so it's not repeat eigenvectors
so those two would be distinct
so let's just do the lambda equals 1
oh that's horrible
so the a minus lambda i
is now going to be 3 minus 1
which is 2
negative 1 negative 1
1
1 minus 1 is 0
negative 1
and 1
and negative 1
and 1
minus 1
is another 0
I'm going to multiply this by
k1
k sub 2
k sub 3
now in actual fact
you've got to call this case of 4
5, 6
doesn't matter
we all know where we're going to end up
so 2 times k sub 1
2 times k sub 1
is going to equal
minus 1
minus 1
minus 1
3
minus 1
is 2
2 times k sub 1
is going to equal
k sub 2
plus k sub 3
or I'm going to have
k sub 1
minus k sub 3
k sub 1
equals k sub 3
and I'm also going to have
k sub 1
equals
minus k sub 2
bring it to the other side
equals k sub 2
so k sub 1
equals k sub 2
equals k sub 3
they're all the same
and there's only one way
where that is going to work
so that's going to be
1 1 1
so that's my last
my last eigenvector
I can now write
my general solution
remember it's going to be
k sub 1
k sub 1 for me
was 1 1 0
e to the power
that was 2t
plus k sub 2
1 0 1
e to the power 2t
they were distinct
plus k sub 3
you have 1 1 1
e to the power t
with lambda
the last lambda being 1
so nice kind of exercise
is these
because you have to go
through so many things
bring back old
basic mathematics
we have long division
of polynomials
to factor out
your third order polynomial
there
we have repeat eigenvalues
fortunately that gave us
two distinct eigenvectors
so we didn't have to go
into our complex equation
to get our set of solutions
which means in the end
we have quite a simple answer
we have quite a simple answer
