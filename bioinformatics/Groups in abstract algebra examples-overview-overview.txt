The text explores two mathematical groups formed by multiplying roots of unity:

1. **Fourth Roots of Unity:**
   - The group \( A \) includes the fourth roots of 1: \( \{1, -1, i, -i\} \).
   - It has a Cayley table demonstrating closure and associativity (verification left to the reader).
   - Identity element is 1.
   - Each element's inverse is:
     - \( 1 \) inverses itself,
     - \( -1 \) inverses itself,
     - \( i \)'s inverse is \( -i \),
     - \( -i \)'s inverse is \( i \).
   - All group properties are satisfied.

2. **Third Roots of Unity:**
   - The set contains the third roots of 1: \( \{1, \omega_1, \omega_2\} \), where:
     - \( \omega_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \),
     - \( \omega_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \).
   - The identity element is 1.
   - Inverses are:
     - \( \omega_1 \)'s inverse is \( \omega_2 \),
     - \( \omega_2 \)'s inverse is \( \omega_1 \),
     - \( 1 \) inverses itself.
   - Closure, associativity (assumed), and unique inverses confirm it forms a group under multiplication.

The text illustrates how groups can naturally emerge from roots of unity with specific operations.
