Now, we've all learned Newton's formulation of mechanics.
It's a time evolution of a mechanical system.
There is an alternative, and I've mentioned this before,
there's an alternative formulation that we don't have to look at determinism and cause.
Now, what did Newton notice?
He noticed there is acceleration.
And he said that proportional to a force.
Now, what is a force?
I can't see a force.
I can see the effect of a force.
I can push this eraser.
There is a force on the eraser now, but what is this force?
And how did he know that that force, what I could call this force,
the forces on this eraser would be the same as the gravitational force of the sun or the earth?
But he noticed this is acceleration, and he put it proportional to a force.
The constant of proportionality was inertia, the inertial mass.
Also, inertial mass and gravitational mass ended up being the same thing.
So, there is this constant of proportionality.
So, from that, you can then clearly see, well, if I double the mass,
because you can have two identical objects, and I applied the same force,
he could see, well, my equation works, because now my acceleration was going to be different,
and he could predict the acceleration from that equation.
F equals mx double dot, F equals ma.
But there is determinism, and there is causality.
There is cause and effect in Newton's first and second laws,
and we derived the third law.
But there is this alternate formulation,
because certainly this cause and effect formulation cannot be applied everywhere.
We talked about it before.
What about an electron and a proton?
Certainly there, we can't use a formulation F equals ma.
We can't use Newton's third law, Newton's first and second laws, and third laws there.
So, this is alternate formulation, where we're not going to make use of any kind of forces.
We're not going to make use of any determination, any causality.
It's an alternative form of mechanics.
And it's beautiful, it's mathematical, but there's also some intuition to it.
If you look at water cascading down, it can be a big waterfall,
just water cascading down a little height.
It takes a certain path.
Why does it take that path?
Well, you can say there's certain forces on it, but there's something else happening here.
Why did it take that specific path?
If I just rolled a coin, it will roll, go in a circle, and wobble and fall down.
Why did it do that specific path?
Why did it choose that specific path?
And the beauty of thinking about that comes out in Hamilton's principle.
If you want to explain this with proper mathematical rigor,
you do need to understand the calculus of variations.
Now, the calculus of variations is not a topic that is dealt with in early courses at university,
but it's certainly worthwhile to know something about the calculus of variations.
So what I'll do, I'll just glance over some of the equations and explanations of the calculus of variations,
but it's certainly an important field all on its own.
So now we're going to have this Hamilton's Principles,
also called the Principle of Extremum Action,
or the Principle of Least Action,
which you can remember from university or from your early days, though,
is if I do have a function in x and y,
and I take the function only from there to there,
here the function reaches a, that is the only domain I'm taking here,
the function I can clearly see reaches a global maximum.
It seems this is a global minimum there,
but in between, everywhere, you remember this,
where the derivative, first derivative, or the slope is 0,
there is a local extremum,
local extremum, and this local extremum is where the first derivative of our function,
first derivative equal to 0, the slope is 0,
and it can be either a local maximum or local minimum.
We're going to make use of this extremum,
it's usually a local minimum,
and that's where it comes.
There's something is a minimum when the water decides to take that path.
Something is a minimum when that coin rolls in a certain pattern.
Something, something,
nature tends to choose the path of some minimum,
and that's what we're going to deal with.
I want to remind you of this equation.
Remember, we said that if I have a function and I take its derivative,
if it's a single variable,
it's just going to be the limit as delta x approaches 0
of this change in function divided by delta x.
That was the limit.
That was df dx.
And we have this delta f equals df dx delta x.
We can write like this.
As I say, I'm not going to go into rigorous mathematical explanations.
Take this for granted if you don't know it.
The change in our function f,
that means its y-axis change,
is going to be partial derivative of f with respect to x.
Now, this is a function in x and y.
It's going to be a partial derivative of f with respect to x
times delta x, the change in x,
plus the partial derivative of f with respect to y times delta y.
That gives us our change in f.
Just remember that equation.
We're going to use it in this derivation.
Lastly, we're going to make use of,
or you've got to think about the phase space,
and the world line.
And I've tried to draw it here.
Now, we can remember a cannonball with an initial velocity,
initial force on it, taking this path.
But that would have been in x and y.
Now, this is phase space.
You'll remember from earlier videos, video lectures.
And in this phase space, we have position on the x-axis.
And we have velocity on the y-axis.
And any point, say for instance, I go from this point towards this point.
It's my initial point.
And my final point, nature is going to decide on a certain path.
Nature will decide on a certain path in this phase space.
And this is time evolution.
Both are functions of time.
So it's time evolution.
Nature will go from a certain position.
Now, it's only here on the x-axis, but that's positioned anywhere in space.
I can jot that down and jot that down.
And that's usually what we're going to end up with this function of f.
We call it l.
And it's going to be a function in q and q dot.
And sometimes even t.
And we'll speak about that t a little later.
So a function is going to be like that.
So I can still write the function of this equation.
But anyway, along the line, there's going to be a point
where I'm going to have the q value, a q value, and a q dot value.
A q value and a q dot value.
And this is the equation that we're after.
So we want to develop this equation.
Instead of f, I just call it l, which stands for the Lagrangian.
So I want that.
Which will be a function.
Initially, we're just going to make it a function of q and q dot.
Which will be the same as a function in x and y.
It'll have two independent variables.
So here it's written with 3q, q dot, and t.
And that function will be a function of this graph
called the world line in phase space.
So any time t, my particle is going to be on this line.
And I need to find this equation.
And the way that we do go about it is just to consider,
again, this principle of extremum action, least action,
that Meijer decides that this is the path
that the particle is going to take.
I don't know what this is.
Now, I could choose any other path for the particle to go from the initial.
Let's say, for instance, the particle goes like this.
That's a path I chose.
That is another possible world line.
Now, it can cross itself.
It can go to another galaxy and come back.
There are a lot of paths that can be taken.
What I want to do, though, and what I want to notice,
that from there to there should be the same time,
irrespective of what path the particle takes.
It starts at the same time and ends at the same time.
And in my experiment, it starts at a point and it ends at a point.
So irrespective of the world lines that is taken,
the world line is actually the actual one that we're interested in,
but we don't know what it is,
is at that time and at that time beginning and end,
it's at the same position.
It's in the same position in space and time.
Now, if it moves in this direction at a certain time,
it might be there and at that same time,
it's got a long way to travel.
So say, for instance, at the same time, it would be there.
So if I just look at that and I look at that,
this difference here, that will be delta Q.
That will be the difference at the same time
if it went on the path that it will take or this other path.
And what we want to know and why this is called the principle of extremum action
is I want that to shrink to nothing.
If all of these, and remember, there will also be a delta Q dot,
big delta Q dot here.
So there's this delta Q and delta Q dot difference between these two paths,
the real one and any alternate one.
And what I want to know is what I want to do
if I shrink all of those differences too,
you can well imagine that this equation will shrink right up
and go lie exactly on that.
Now, in order to get that, we have this function called S.
And that S is an action.
We call that an action.
And we set that equal to a definite integral
and going from time initial to time final,
let's call it time one,
to time two of our function LQ and Q dot.
I'm just going to leave it there now with respect to time.
Usually, we'll have a T in there as well.
I'll say a few words on that.
So that is called the action.
And what you can see is on this equation for this world line,
that will just be the area under the curve.
I call that my action.
Now, that is this LQ and Q dot.
I'm just going to leave it like that.
That is the actual equation for this graph.
But I can now have my alternate one.
So that will be Q plus delta Q.
And Q dot plus delta Q dot.
That will be the area under the curve for this alternate.
Now, this is a calculus of variation.
So if it doesn't make too much sense,
just take it on face value.
That will be the equation for this function of mine.
Now, even if I don't put T here,
I just want to say a few words about that.
I don't put T there as a third variable.
Q is a function of T and Q dot is a function of T.
Those will both be equations.
Because for Q, I can have an xy plot,
and that will be a graph on its own.
And I can parametize it as a function of time.
So it becomes a line with a direction.
And same with velocity.
So those are both functions of time.
So implicitly, my Lagrangian function,
my L function, is a function of T.
And if I put comma T in,
that will explicitly be.
Now, when will we have this L, Q, Q dot, and T?
That means there is some change in time.
Now, we are supposed to be talking about time invariance.
That there should be no difference in the laws of physics
from one time period to another.
If there is change, though, something happened.
And we refer to that as a hidden degree of freedom.
If I push this board eraser,
if I push it like that,
there is some frictional force at the bottom.
So something is happening.
I'm just going to make it simple
without going into deep explanation.
There's only two forms of energy.
Potential energy and kinetic energy.
Any other form and the friction that is in there now,
that is not a frictional force per se.
That doesn't really exist.
There's some hidden degrees of freedom there.
There's interaction between the surfaces that touch each other.
So there's, if something happens,
and I have to take consideration of that,
and I would have had to build that into my very long equation,
my Lagrangian equation.
Otherwise, if I don't build that in,
there's something different between the first and the second.
Something was lost,
and we amalgamated in easy physics,
if I can call it that,
by saying there's some average frictional force.
It's actually just hidden degrees of freedom
as far as time variance
with respect specifically to t is concerned.
But for practical purposes here,
we only need to consider the Lagrangian
with respect to position and velocity.
So we have that.
Now, I want,
back to my phase space diagram here,
I want least action,
or extreme action,
usually a minimum.
And how can I do that?
I need for these delta q's and delta q dots
to go to a minimum.
So what I really want,
what I really want,
is I want this delta s
to equal zero.
So if I subtract
the integral area under the curve
of this one minus that one,
I want that to go to zero.
And that is the extremum action,
or least action.
I want that to be a zero.
So what is that going to be?
Well, it's this integral
going from t1 to t2
of the L of q plus delta q,
comma, q dot,
plus delta q dot,
dt,
minus the integral,
I'm going from t1 to t2,
of L of q and q dot,
with respect to time.
So that is what I am looking for.
I want this difference to be zero.
Now, it's not simple calculus.
It is calculus of variations,
which, as I said,
I won't explain here.
But I just want these two,
at any time,
for these two to shrink
and be on top of each other.
And that will be
the calculus of variations
in the mistime,
and it would be an extremum
if this goes to zero.
So what I'm just writing here
is zero equals delta s
equals the integral,
and going from t1 to t2,
of delta L
q dot dt.
So it is just this one
minus this one.
All the difference
between these two
is delta L.
That's the change in L
because of
a different pathway.
And
I write here delta L,
and I want to refer you back
to this delta f.
It was a function f and x and y.
Yeah, I have a function in q,
q dot, same thing.
And I can write it
in that form.
So zero equals delta s
equals the integral,
I'm going from t1 to t2,
of that.
So that is going to be
delta L
delta q
plus
delta L
delta q dot
delta q dot
dt.
Okay,
and now we remember
easy problems in physics,
in elementary calculus,
so I'm just going to
break this up
t1, t2,
and I'm going to have
del L
del
q dot
del L
delta q
dt
plus the interval
I'm going from t1
to t2
of del L
delta q
dot
delta q
dt.
I'm going to
clean the board
and we'll carry on
with this
derivation.
So we continue
with our derivation,
we stuck there now
with these two
integrals.
Now,
on that side,
I think we can see
that we can,
it's a product of
two functions
and we can use
the product rule
for this integral.
And what I can do
is I make use
of this stating
which one is u
or which one
is v prime.
Let's make v prime
this delta q dot,
delta q dot,
which means
v equals
delta q,
because q dot
is the first
derivative of q.
So that means
this must be
dl di L
or del L
del q dot,
which means
u prime is
the d dt,
d dt of
del L
del q dot.
So I can use
the product rule,
I'm going to have
u v minus
the integral
of u prime v.
As far as that,
I'm not going to go
into the details
of doing the product rule
for integration.
So 0 equals
delta s,
and that is going
to be this integral
going from t1
to t2
of del L
del q delta q
dt,
plus,
now I'm going
to have
u times v,
u times v
del L
del q dot,
del L
del q dot,
times delta q,
and I evaluate
this at t1
and t2,
minus
the integral
I'm going
from t1
to t2
of u prime v.
So,
that is
these two.
So that's
the d dt,
the d dt
of del L
del q dot
delta q dt.
Now,
just think
about this.
I'm going
to evaluate
this at t1
and at t2.
What I said
in the beginning
though,
is at the initial
and at the final
points,
there is no
delta q.
There,
the two values
are exactly
the same.
Here,
the two values
are exactly
the same.
and there is
no delta q
there,
there is no
delta q dot
t.
So you can
clearly see
that this term
is going
to go to
zero.
That term
is going
to fall
away.
Evaluate it
because there's
going to be
a zero
in the first
one and a
zero in the
second one.
So zero
negative
zero is
zero.
So I'm
left with
these two
terms and I
can just
very quickly
simplify these
two and I
can combine
them together
and I see
I have a
delta q
as a common
factor.
So I can
write zero
is going
to be this
minimum
that is going
to be the
integral
and then
from t1
to t2
of
I'm going
to have
the
del l
and del
q
minus
the dvt
of
del l
del q
dot
and then
both of
these
has a
delta q
in them
delta q
dt
delta q
dt
now I've
got to do
this integral
of this
function
this expression
I should
say
and that
has got
to equal
zero
now
what is
the only
way that
this integral
can be
zero
if I look
at this
term
and I
look at
this term
now
I don't
want this
term
to be
zero
because
I've
got
my
world
line
and any
other
possible
world
lines
I want
there to
be
delta
q
otherwise
we won't
have this
concept
of
the two
possibilities
and then
going
towards
the real
one
so the
only way
that I
can really
have
this
integral
being
zero
is
this
term
zero
I want
this
to be
an
arbitrary
any
possibility
as I
say
to another
galaxy
and back
as far
as the
alternative
one is
concerned
so the
only one
I have
is this
equaling
zero
so
del
l
del
q
minus
the
ddt
of
del
l
del
q
dot
is
going
to
equal
zero
and
that
is
where
we
have
that
is
where
we
have
the
Lagrangian
of a
system
set up
in the
next
video
I'll
explain
to you
what
we
can
do
with
this
now
I left
you off
with
Lagrange's
equation
del
l
del
q
minus
the
ddt
of
del
l
del
q
dot
should
be
zero
I
could
also
just
take
this
to
the
other
side
they
take
this
to
the
other
side
those
two
has
got
to
be
equal
to
each
other
now
of
course
people
sat
with
this
and
just
said
what
can
this
l
be
what
can
this
function
be
so
that
if
I
take
that
function
and I
take
this
partial
derivative
with
respect
to
position
that
has
got
to
equal
the
derivative
with
respect
to
time
of
the
partial
derivative
with
respect
to
velocity
what
can
that
be
now
there's
a bit
of
the
Lagrangian
equals
a half
m
q dot
squared
minus
v
vq
the
potential
energy
so
what
am I
trying
to
say
there
it
is
kinetic
energy
minus
potential
energy
as
simple
as
that
and
if
you
plug
that
in
you
will
see
that
this
works
so
let's
just
have
a
look
at
that
now
q
dot
is
velocity
q
dot
is
velocity
and
potential
energy
does
not
contain
velocity
remember
when we
just
looked at
I have
something
here
it's
a meter
down
so
for
all
the
day
it
has
potential
energy
and
that
potential
energy
was
just
mgh
mass
times
gravitational
acceleration
times
the
height
that
was
its
potential
energy
or
I
could
have
put
a
negative
there
depending
on
how
I
set
things
up
but
see
there
velocity
doesn't
play
a part
there
it's
only
q
height
it's
just
the
position
it is
so
high
up
so
that
will
be
mg
q
so this
is a
function
just of
q and
not
q dot
okay
so
let's
do
that
let's
take
del
l
my
lagrangian
del
l
del
q
so just
with respect
to
there's
a q
dot
and not
a q
so all
I'm
going to
be left
with
is
the
derivative
of
this
so it
was
basically
going to
be
minus
v
q
and
that
was
going
to
be
the
d
dt
of
that
so what
is
the
first
derivative
of energy
you might
remember this
from
calculus
well that's
just a
force
that is
just a
force
the first
derivative
of velocity
gives you
force
what is
del
l
del
q
dot
del
l
what do
we need
that's
del
l
del
q
del
l
del
q
dot
sorry
so what
is that
going to
be
well
there's
a q
dot
only
in
this
so that's
going to
give me
n
q
dot
m
q
dot
and
what
is
the
d
dt
what is
the
d
dt
I still
have to
get that
of
m
q
dot
well
that's
m
q
double
dot
that's
ma
that's
ma
and that's
equal to
the force
as well
so force
equals
force
on both
sides
and it
better work
out like
that
because
if it
didn't
come
to
to be
this
then
this
initial
equation
that I
chose
here
kinetic
energy
minus
potential
energy
wouldn't
have
worked
out
for
me
but
beautifully
there
I have
never
used
in any
of these
derivations
to get
to this
in this
derivation
have I
ever used
causality
or determinism
there's no
force
there's no
effect
I will use
this
thinking
beautifully
about nature
chooses
some kind
of minimum
and the
minimum
it chooses
is that
the actual
world line
that it
takes
I can
construct
any other
possibility
but nature
will choose
the one
that's
at some
form of
minimum
so if I
choose
any alternative
path
and I
subtract
those two
and make
those delta
q's and
delta q
dots
an extremum
in this
case a
minimum
I'm going
to end
up with
this
as long
as I
have the
same
initial
position
and the
same
final
position
and the
same
time
and I
get this
which is
Lagrange's
equation
so I've
set up
all I
need to
now do
if I
have some
problem
that I
have to
solve
is set
up the
Lagrangian
of the
system
and I
can do
these
equations
and it
will pop
for me
an answer
in other
words I
can still
see what
the acceleration
will be
I can
still derive
what force
would have
had to be
applied
for that
but without
using force
and acceleration
at all
initially
to start
off with
I can
set up
I'm only
looking at
q and q
dot
now once
again I
just want
to reiterate
I didn't
have t
I don't
have t
in these
functions
I only
have them
in here
with velocity
I only
have them
implicitly
not explicitly
but I
have q
q dot
and if I
had t
if Lagrangian
changed over
time
and I
didn't put
that in
in my
original
IMP
and if I
set up
my Lagrangian
only with
q and q
dot
and there
was something
that I
did not
take into
consideration
for instance
these
electromagnetic
interactions
between
these atoms
of the
surfaces
okay
I'm going
to get
the incorrect
answer
there's not
going to be
the force
and acceleration
that I
predicted
through
Newton's
laws
because
there is
this
hidden
degrees
of
freedom
I
did
not
take
into
consideration
that
or
if I
didn't
write
my
equation
this
equation
properly
more in
a more
expansive
form
to take
into
consideration
all these
things
obviously
then my
equations
and my
outcomes
of
experiment
are
going to
be
different
because
they
are
hidden
degrees
of
freedom
that I
did
not
and that
is where
we don't
say energy
changes
to frictional
energy
or it
escapes
in heat
to the
given
degrees
of
freedom
that I
do not
take
into
consideration
in my
Lagrange's
equation
in setting
up my
Lagrange
I should
say
so the
beautifully
Lagrange's
equation
with a
little bit
of
mathematics
skipped
over a
few
parts
as far
as
the
calculus
of
variations
is
concerned
but not
too
difficult
so for
the
first
time
now
you
know
how
to
what
Lagrange's
equation
is
and
I have
to
set up
the
Lagrange
and
it's
basic
for
very
basic
physics
it is
this
potential
kinetic
energy
minus
potential
energy
and
I
have
Lagrange's
equation
here
so in
the next
lot of
videos
we'll
go to
the
Hamiltonian
of
the
system
this
is
the
Lagrange
and
we're
going
to
set
up
the
Hamiltonian
give you
a sneak
preview
just to
whet the
appetite
but the
Hamiltonian
is
going to
be
nothing
other
than
the
total
energy
it's
going
to
be
T
plus
V
so
it's
the
only
type
of
energy
we're
considering
true
forms
of
energy
that
you
cannot
make
or
destroy
this
type
of
energy
so
the
Hamiltonian
is
going
to
be
T
plus
V
and
we'll
see
the
two
equations
here
we just
have
one
with
setting
up
the
Hamiltonian
you're
going
to
get
two
equations
