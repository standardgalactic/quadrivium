The text discusses how any constant can be expressed as \( e \) raised to the power of its natural logarithm, expanding our understanding of exponential expressions beyond just using \( e^x \). By adding a variable to the exponent, we move from polynomial forms—where variables are in the base—to transcendental functions, where variables reside in the exponents. This distinction is crucial for performing differentiation and integration on these types of functions.
