The text describes two related problems involving capacitors and dielectric materials:

1. **Problem 1: Determining Dielectric Constant**
   - You are given a capacitor with an initial capacitance of 7.4 pico-farads that needs to store a potential energy of \(7.4 \times 10^{-6}\) joules at a maximum potential difference of 652 volts.
   - The formula for the stored energy in a capacitor is \( u = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \).
   - To find the final capacitance (\(C_{\text{final}}\)), we use the relationship involving the dielectric constant (\(\kappa\)): \(C_{\text{final}} = \kappa C_{\text{initial}}\).
   - Rearranging for \(\kappa\), we get: 
     \[
     \kappa = \frac{2 U_{\text{final}}}{C_{\text{initial}} V^2}
     \]
   - This formula allows us to calculate the dielectric constant needed to achieve the desired energy storage at the given voltage.

2. **Problem 2: Maximum Plate Area for a Capacitor**
   - A substance with a dielectric constant of 2.8 and a dielectric strength of 18 megavolts per meter is used in a parallel plate capacitor.
   - The goal is to achieve a capacitance of \(7.0 \times 10^{-8}\) farads while ensuring the capacitor can handle a potential difference of 4 kilovolts.
   - The capacitance formula for a parallel plate capacitor is \( C = \kappa \frac{A}{D} \), where \(A\) is the area and \(D\) is the separation between plates.
   - Using the relationship \( D = \frac{V}{\text{Dielectric Field Strength}} \), we can express \( A \) as:
     \[
     A = \frac{C \cdot D}{\kappa} = \frac{C \cdot V}{\kappa \times \text{Dielectric Field Strength}}
     \]
   - This allows calculation of the minimum plate area required to achieve the specified capacitance and voltage rating.

Both problems involve understanding the relationships between capacitance, dielectric properties, potential difference, and physical dimensions in capacitor design.
