Your problem-solving approach involves calculating angles related to refraction and polarization of light at an interface between two media. Let's break down the key components:

### Snell's Law
Snell's law relates the angle of incidence (\(\theta_i\)) and the angle of refraction (\(\theta_t\)) with the indices of refraction of the two media (Ni for the incident medium, Nt for the refractive medium):

\[ Ni \cdot \sin(\theta_i) = Nt \cdot \sin(\theta_t) \]

### Critical Angle
The critical angle (\(\theta_c\)) is the angle of incidence in a denser medium beyond which total internal reflection occurs. It can be calculated using:

\[ \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{Nt}{Ni}\right) \]

In your example, for light going from a medium with \( Ni = 1.58 \) to one with \( Nt = 1.53 \):

\[ \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{1.53}{1.58}\right) \approx 75.547^\circ \]

### Brewster's Angle
Brewster's angle (\(\theta_B\)) is the angle of incidence at which reflected light is completely polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence. It can be calculated as:

\[ \theta_B = \arctan\left(\frac{Nt}{Ni}\right) \]

For a water-air interface with \( Ni = 1.00 \) and \( Nt = 1.33 \):

\[ \theta_B = \arctan\left(\frac{1.33}{1.00}\right) \approx 53.1^\circ \]

### Verification
At Brewster's angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular:

- Reflected angle (\(\theta_r\)) equals incident angle (\(\theta_i = \theta_B\)).
- Angle between refracted ray (\(\theta_t\)) and reflected ray is \(90^\circ\).

Using Snellâ€™s law to find \(\theta_t\) at Brewster's angle:

\[ \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{Ni}{Nt} \cdot \sin(\theta_B) \]

Plug in the values:

\[ \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{1.00}{1.33} \cdot \sin(53.1^\circ) \approx 0.6 \]

Thus, 

\[ \theta_t = \arcsin(0.6) \approx 36.9^\circ \]

Checking the sum:

\[ \theta_r + \theta_t = 53.1^\circ + 36.9^\circ = 90^\circ \]

This confirms that at Brewster's angle, the reflected and refracted angles are complementary.

Your calculations and understanding of these concepts appear to be correct.
