Your problem-solving approach involves calculating angles related to refraction and polarization of light at an interface between two media. Let's break down the key components:

### Snell's Law
Snell's law relates the angle of incidence (\(\theta_i\)) and the angle of refraction (\(\theta_t\)) with the indices of refraction of the two media (Ni for the incident medium, Nt for the refractive medium):

\[ Ni \cdot \sin(\theta_i) = Nt \cdot \sin(\theta_t) \]

### Critical Angle
The critical angle (\(\theta_c\)) is the angle of incidence in a denser medium beyond which total internal reflection occurs. It can be calculated using:

\[ \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{Nt}{Ni}\right) \]

In your example, for light going from a medium with \( Ni = 1.58 \) to one with \( Nt = 1.53 \):

\[ \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{1.53}{1.58}\right) \approx 75.547^\circ \]

### Brewster's Angle
Brewster's angle (\(\theta_B\)) is the angle of incidence at which reflected light is completely polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence. It can be calculated as:

\[ \theta_B = \arctan\left(\frac{Nt}{Ni}\right) \]

For a water-air interface with \( Ni = 1.00 \) and \( Nt = 1.33 \):

\[ \theta_B = \arctan\left(\frac{1.33}{1.00}\right) \approx 53.1^\circ \]

### Verification
At Brewster's angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular:

- Reflected angle (\(\theta_r\)) equals incident angle (\(\theta_i = \theta_B\)).
- Angle between refracted ray (\(\theta_t\)) and reflected ray is \(90^\circ\).

Using Snell’s law to find \(\theta_t\) at Brewster's angle:

\[ \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{Ni}{Nt} \cdot \sin(\theta_B) \]

Plug in the values:

\[ \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{1.00}{1.33} \cdot \sin(53.1^\circ) \approx 0.6 \]

Thus, 

\[ \theta_t = \arcsin(0.6) \approx 36.9^\circ \]

Checking the sum:

\[ \theta_r + \theta_t = 53.1^\circ + 36.9^\circ = 90^\circ \]

This confirms that at Brewster's angle, the reflected and refracted angles are complementary.

Your calculations and understanding of these concepts appear to be correct.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step to ensure clarity and accuracy:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Incident and Refracted Angles:**
   - You're dealing with light transitioning from air (refractive index \( n_i = 1 \)) into water (refractive index \( n_t = 1.33 \)).
   - The angle of incidence is denoted as \( \theta_i \), and the angle of refraction as \( \theta_t \).

2. **Brewster's Angle:**
   - Brewster's angle (\( \theta_B \)) is the angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a surface, with no reflection.
   - It can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \theta_B = \arctan\left(\frac{n_t}{n_i}\right)
     \]
   - For air to water transition: 
     \[
     \theta_B = \arctan\left(\frac{1.33}{1}\right) \approx 53.1^\circ
     \]

3. **Law of Reflection and Refraction:**
   - According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
   - Snell's Law relates the angles of incidence and refraction:
     \[
     n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \sin(\theta_t)
     \]

4. **Verification of Brewster's Angle:**
   - At Brewster's angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other.
   - Therefore, \( \theta_B + \theta_t = 90^\circ \).

5. **Calculation of Refractive Angle (\( \theta_t \)):**
   - Using Snell’s Law:
     \[
     \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{n_i}{n_t} \sin(\theta_B)
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{1}{1.33} \sin(53.1^\circ)
     \]
   - Calculating \( \theta_t \):
     \[
     \theta_t = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{1.33} \times 0.7986\right) \approx \arcsin(0.6005) \approx 36.9^\circ
     \]

6. **Verification:**
   - Check if \( \theta_B + \theta_t = 90^\circ \):
     \[
     53.1^\circ + 36.9^\circ = 90^\circ
     \]
   - This confirms that the calculations are correct.

### Conclusion

The angle at which light is totally polarized upon reflection from water is approximately \( 53.1^\circ \). At this angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other, satisfying Brewster's condition.
