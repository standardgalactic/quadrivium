The text describes a method for finding the area between two curves: \( y = \sqrt{x} \) and \( y = x - 2 \). This involves dividing the task into two regions based on their intersection points:

1. **Determine Intervals:** 
   - The first interval is from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \), where the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \) is above the x-axis, and the line \( y = x - 2 \) intersects the x-axis at \( x = 2 \).

2. **First Region (from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \)):**
   - Calculate the area under the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \).
   - The integral is \(\int_{0}^{2} \sqrt{x} \, dx\), which evaluates to \(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

3. **Find Intersection Point for Second Region:**
   - Solve \(\sqrt{x} = x - 2\) by squaring both sides and solving the resulting quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0\).
   - The valid intersection point in the first quadrant is at \( x = 4 \).

4. **Second Region (from \( x = 2 \) to \( x = 4 \)):**
   - Here, \( y = \sqrt{x} \) is above \( y = x - 2 \).
   - Calculate the area between these curves with \(\int_{2}^{4} (\sqrt{x} - (x - 2)) \, dx\), which simplifies to:
     \[
     \left[ \frac{16}{3} - \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} - 2 \right]
     \]

5. **Total Area:**
   - Sum the areas from both regions:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} + \left( \frac{16}{3} - \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{10}{3}
     \]

The final result is the total area between the curves, calculated as \(\frac{10}{3}\). The text also mentions an error correction process that confirms this result.
