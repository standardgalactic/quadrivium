The text explains how to find the indefinite integral of the function \(\cos(2x + 4)\) with respect to \(x\) using substitution. Initially, it mentions a method involving identifying and creating related derivative functions but opts for a more straightforward approach instead.

Using substitution, let \(u = 2x + 4\), which gives \(du/dx = 2\). Rearranging this, we find \(dx = \frac{1}{2} du\). Substituting these into the integral, it becomes:

\[
\int \cos(2x + 4) \, dx = \int \cos(u) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, du
\]

Applying the constant multiple rule, this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int \cos(u) \, du
\]

The integral of \(\cos(u)\) with respect to \(u\) is \(\sin(u)\), so we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin(u) + C
\]

Finally, substituting back for \(u\), the result is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin(2x + 4) + C
\]

This method efficiently finds the indefinite integral without needing additional functions.

The text explains how to find the indefinite integral of \(\cos(2x + 4)\) with respect to \(x\) using substitution. Initially, it suggests identifying or constructing a second function that is the derivative of the expression inside the cosine function (i.e., \(2x+4\), whose derivative is 2). This would lead to rewriting the integral as \(\int 2 \cos(2x + 4) \, dx\) and then dividing by 2. However, a simpler approach is introduced through substitution.

Using straightforward substitution, set \(u = 2x + 4\), which gives \(du/dx = 2\). Solving for \(dx\), we get \(dx = \frac{1}{2} du\). Substitute these into the integral to obtain:

\[
\int \cos(u) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int \cos(u) \, du
\]

The antiderivative of \(\cos(u)\) is \(\sin(u)\), so the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin(u) + C
\]

Substituting back \(u = 2x + 4\), the final result is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin(2x + 4) + C
\]

This method avoids creating extra functions and directly uses substitution to solve the integral.
