and now we're going to get to our data collection tool now this really depends how much money you
have house house you your unit is set up how much research has been done there in most areas in the
world we are severely resource constrained we do not have research offices they people to do data
collection nothing nothing like that it's only units that have got a good track record that's
published a lot or are in big first of all kind of ivory towers that have good data acquisition tools
and have data available electronically already etc and most resource constrained environments
this is not the case so what i'm going to suggest here is really the bare bones minimum that you can
do yourself that anyone can do irrespective of the resources as long as they have obviously have
internet connection and from this base you can build and build very fancy tools so what i'm going to
suggest here you see there is just using google forms we're just going to use google forms now be
very careful and careful about what you're going to put on your google forms because that is putting
patient data on unsecure servers to some extent at least unsecure service service so it's you've got
to be absolutely sure that you are allowed to do this get permission to do this and it is of so much
of utmost importance to protect patient identification if you use a tool like this and for that matter any kind
of tool that you use has got to protect patient anonymity and this is how we're going to go about
it on the left hand side we had our data required then you see two other columns that i want to discuss
with you in this section we'll have our anonymity format and you see the data point values now the first
thing of course we identify patients from the admission record from the clerk's notes or from
the hospital's electronic record system whatever the situation is so we've got to have a patient now
that can be a patient name and surname it can be a patient national identification number anything but
we never want to capture that kind of data in our data collection tool no matter how fancy it is it is
wrong to do that under most circumstances so how do we anonymize that especially if we want to use
an open tool like this well we're just going to have a patient id and that is just going to be a
natural number natural numbers we know start at one one two three four five so every patient that i
admit it's just going to have a number starting from one that would be the easiest way to do it
very separate from the data collection tool even if it's on a piece of paper that is isn't anywhere near
this data collection tool i might keep a record that says patient one is john doe or that hospital
number and that national identification number so that i can refer back to it but that is never
captured on this main data collection tool that is kept absolutely separate we've got to identify
everyone who's involved in this research we'll identify who's going to keep that those records
and perhaps even in this day and age as a as a basic set of information is to keep that separate and
on paper somewhere locked away of course build up from that the more sophisticated your system is you
might have a way better ways of dealing with this but if you are resource constrained that's going to
go on a piece of paper and that is really going to be hidden away and held quite separately from all of
this data analysis so that we know if we wanted to look at something specific we can go back and see
patient number three was so and so and we can go back to that file but as far as our data collection
tool is concerned we'll only have patient number one patient number two no one will know who that is
next up remember is our infection category we need to know if it's major or minor but we will not put
in our data collection tool the word infection and then have minor and major
might mean a minor major filled in on our data collection tool no we'll write something like cat
one for category one you can choose whatever you want as long as no one can realize that cat one
refers to infection or type of infection no one should be able to draw that parallel between the
two so if someone gets hold of your data collection tool it just says cat one no one knows what cat one
is and the data point values that are that are entered into the cells in your data collection tool in
our instance here we're going to use google forms we'll just use something like minor as a and major
as b so every time it's a minor infection we might write a and every time it's a major infection we might
write b you can come up with whatever you want you can call it grass and sky you can do whatever you
want you can have more than one more than one things that refer to main minor major and you'll see in
the next row there we're actually going to do that this is the basics though a for minor b for major make it more
complex than that so here we get to gender in our form where the data collection goes we're going to
call it cat 2 call it something that's even worse than that just so long as you know what cat 2 is
and that it refers to gender and here we see on the right hand side so we're going to use either c x or
r so if there's someone who's collecting that data can either write c x or r when it comes to female
and they can write f l or b now that's just totally thumbs up and you can make it much more complex than
that so if someone sees that list of data they're going to see c f x b r it makes no sense okay and
as i say this is just a baseline please make it more complex than this this is just for illustrative
purposes in this in in this project of ours julia project of ours when it comes to age well we might
write var one or variable one you can write whatever you want as long as you know var one refers to age
now this can become complex we can we can do large studies of course with lots of variables on on
which we're going to collect data points so once again you can keep separate from your data collection
tool what these anonymized column headers are going to be called for again for the argument's sake just
for this little project of ours we're going to call it var two now what you can do again baseline
please make it more complex we can all everyone who's involved in this project can decide whenever
you jot down a patient's age in the data collection tool mentally add the value five so if someone is
33 years old make them 38 and so you go for everyone so that's a little mental arithmetic so that's one way
to anonymize the data there are the age variable at least there are many more ways you can make it much
more complex but do not jot down the patient's actual date of birth in any form and not age either
especially at extremes of age people can be identified because of the extremity of their age
there is not a lot of 99 year olds running around so come up with some way of scrambling that data age
for argument's sake for the sake of this research project we're just going to add the value five to
all the ages which means when we do our data analysis in julia we've got to subtract five from
everyone's age and that's very easy to do in julia no problem hba1c we're going to call it var one
crp we're going to call var three and in this little project we're just going to collect the actual data
points very difficult if you get hold of lab values a lot of patients are patients are going to have
hba1c values of say for argument's sake 4.4 percent and a lot of patients are going to have crps of 345
uh well i should i should use a more common say let's say 55 um in the real world situation though
i would also scramble those two data values by some simple equation as well but for this project
we're going to do that so in the next section we're just going to go to google forms most most of you
know how to use google forms we're just going to set up very quickly a part of this data collection tool
before we go over to julia and do the interesting bit do the actual analysis
