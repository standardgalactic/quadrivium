The text provides an overview and solution process for calculating drift velocity in a copper wire under given conditions. Here’s a summary:

1. **Drift Velocity Calculation**: 
   - A copper wire with a radius of \(900 \times 10^{-6}\) meters carries a uniform current of \(17 \times 10^{-3}\) amperes.
   - Each copper atom contributes one conduction electron, and the goal is to find the drift speed using the equation for drift velocity (\(v_d\)), which depends on current density and the number of charge carriers per unit volume (\(n\)).
   - The formula used is \(v_d = \frac{I}{A \cdot n \cdot e}\), where:
     - \(I\) is the current,
     - \(A\) is the cross-sectional area,
     - \(n\) is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, calculated using density and molar mass,
     - \(e\) is the elementary charge (\(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\) coulombs).
   - For copper, \(n\) is determined to be \(8.49 \times 10^{28}\) per cubic meter, leading to a drift velocity of approximately \(4.9 \times 10^{-17}\) meters per second.

2. **Current Density and Drift Velocity**:
   - The text discusses another scenario involving doubly charged positive ions in a beam.
   - Conversion from cubic centimeters to cubic meters is necessary for calculations.
   - Current density (\(J\)) calculation uses the formula \(J = 2n \cdot e \cdot v_d\), accounting for double charge.

3. **Fuse Design**:
   - A fuse melts at a specified current density (440 NPS per square centimeter, converted to per square meter).
   - The task is to determine the diameter of a wire that limits current to 0.50 NPS.
   - Using \(J = \frac{I}{\pi R^2}\), solve for radius (\(R\)) and thus diameter.

Throughout, the text emphasizes unit conversion, formula application, and understanding physical concepts such as drift velocity and current density in electrical conductors.

The text provides an overview of several physics concepts related to circular measurements, solar wind properties, electric fields, and electrical resistance.

1. **Circular Measurements**: It discusses using the value of π (pi) to calculate the radius and diameter from given data. The conversion between units is highlighted as a common source of error.

2. **Solar Wind Properties**: Near Earth, the proton density in the solar wind is approximately 8.7 protons per cubic centimeter. Converting this to a per cubic meter measurement requires multiplying by \(10^6\) (since \(100 \text{ cm} = 1 \text{ m}\) and cubing gives \(10^6\)). The speed of these protons is given as 470,000 meters per second.

3. **Electric Density**: To calculate the current density (\(J\)) of the protons, use \(J = NV\) where \(N\) is the proton density and \(V\) is their velocity. For total electric current with no Earth magnetic field, apply \(I = JA\), using the cross-sectional area of the Earth's surface.

4. **Resistance and Resistivity**:
   - **Resistance (R)**: A property of an object, calculated as potential difference (\(V\)) divided by current (\(I\)).
   - **Resistivity (ρ)**: A material-specific property affected by temperature, defined as electric field (\(E\)) per charge density. Algebraically, it relates to resistance via \(R = \frac{\rho L}{A}\), where \(L\) is the length and \(A\) is the cross-sectional area.
   - **Conductivity**: The inverse of resistivity.

5. **Temperature and Resistivity**: For metals, resistivity (\(\rho\)) changes linearly with temperature. This relationship is expressed as \(\rho = \rho_0 + \alpha(T - T_0)\), where \(\rho_0\) is the resistivity at a reference temperature \(T_0\), and \(\alpha\) is the temperature coefficient.

The key points are understanding how resistance and resistivity differ, their mathematical relationships, and how temperature affects resistivity. These concepts help in analyzing electrical systems and materials' behavior under varying conditions.
