The text provides an introduction to the equations used for spherical mirrors in optics. It explains several conventions for distances related to concave and convex mirrors:

1. **Distance Conventions**:
   - The distance from the object to a mirror (object distance) is always positive if the object is in front of the mirror.
   - The image distance is positive for real images and negative for virtual images.

2. **Mirror Parameters**:
   - \( R \), the radius of curvature, is positive for convex mirrors and negative for concave mirrors.
   - The focal length (\( F \)) is related to the radius by \( F = -\frac{R}{2} \).

3. **Equations**:
   - Mirror equation: \(\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = -\frac{2}{R}\) or \(\frac{1}{F}\).
   - Transverse magnification is given by \( M = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{\text{image height}}{\text{object height}} \).

The text also includes a practical example involving plane mirrors and determining the properties of images formed by them. Specifically, it considers:
- The reflection in plane mirrors to form multiple images.
- Determining the minimum size and placement of a mirror so that a person can see their full image from feet to head.

These principles are essential for solving problems related to spherical and plane mirrors in optics.

The text describes a scenario where the goal is to determine the minimum size and position of a mirror required for a person standing three meters away to see their entire body, from head to toe. 

Here's a summary:

1. **Positioning**: The person is positioned such that their image appears in front at the same distance (three meters).

2. **Ray Diagrams**: Light rays must travel from different parts of the personâ€™s body (feet and eyes) to the mirror and back to be seen.

3. **Mirror Size Calculation**:
   - For the top of the head: Rays originating from the eyes need to reach the mirror, which will then reflect them to allow the person to see their entire height. The necessary mirror length for this is determined by halving the distance between the eyes and the top of the head.
   - For the feet: Similarly, rays must travel from the feet to the mirror and back up to the eyes. This requires a calculation based on the total height.

4. **Minimum Dimensions**:
   - The vertical position (elevation) from the floor should be 70 centimeters so that the person can see their feet.
   - The length of the mirror itself needs to be 75 centimeters, accounting for both the top and bottom visibility, including an additional length for seeing the eyes.

5. **Conclusion**: To allow a person standing three meters away to see from head to toe, a mirror must be positioned 70 centimeters above the floor with a total length of 75 centimeters. 

The text ends with appreciation for explaining this concept clearly.

The text provides an overview of equations related to spherical mirrors and explains conventions for distances in these equations. The key equation discussed relates object distance (from the mirror), image distance (from the mirror), radius of curvature \( R \), and focal length \( F \) as follows:

\[ \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = -\frac{2}{R} = \frac{1}{F} \]

where:
- \( d_o \) is the object distance (positive in front of the mirror),
- \( d_i \) is the image distance (positive for real images and negative for virtual images),
- \( R \) is the radius of curvature (negative for concave mirrors, positive for convex mirrors),
- \( F = -\frac{R}{2} \).

The conventions specify that object distances are always positive since objects are in front of the mirror. Image distances depend on whether the image is real or virtual, and focal lengths vary based on whether the mirror is concave or convex.

It also introduces transverse magnification for spherical mirrors as:

\[ m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{\text{image height}}{\text{object height}} \]

Additionally, there are examples involving plane mirrors and an application problem about determining the minimum size of a mirror required for a person to see their full image. In this scenario, because it's a plane mirror, the distance behind the mirror is equal to that in front, facilitating visibility of both feet and head in the reflection.

The text describes a scenario where the position of an image in front of a mirror is analyzed. It's explained that to see his entire body from head to toe, the person standing three meters away needs rays of light to travel from his feet up to his eyes, which are reflected by the mirror.

To determine the minimum length and elevation of the mirror required for him to see both his head and toes, a geometric approach is used. The key points noted include:

1. **Image Positioning**: By drawing lines representing parallel rays of light between his body parts (head and feet) and their reflections, it's shown that these rays bisect specific distances.
2. **Mirror Length Calculation**:
   - For the top part: 10 centimeters is bisected to 5 centimeters for seeing the head.
   - For the bottom part: 14 centimeters is bisected to 7 centimeters for seeing the feet.
3. **Elevation and Total Length**: 
   - The mirror must be elevated 70 centimeters from the floor (bottom edge) to ensure visibility of the toes.
   - Adding the extra height needed to see the eyes, the total length of the mirror is calculated as 75 centimeters.

In summary, for the person standing three meters away to view both his head and feet in the mirror, it needs to be positioned at a minimum elevation of 70 centimeters from the floor and should have a length of 75 centimeters.
