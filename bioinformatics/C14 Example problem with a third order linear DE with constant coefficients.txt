now let's have a look at this problem
that's the first time we're going to deal with an equation of third order linear still
homogeneous still differential equation ordinary so our auxiliary equation is going to equal and
this is where you might make a mistake is m to the power three plus three m squared minus four
but not four m this this is this y there's actually a zero m in there because it's y triple prime y
double prime y prime y so that y prime is not there so don't put an m there equals zero now how do we
factor something like this the best way to do this is to probably accept the fact that you're going
to get at least some exams you're going to get easier type problems and if you just look at it
if i if you just look at it and just think to yourself if i let m equal one it's going to be
one plus three is four minus four equals zero so immediately i know one of the values it's going
to be that in other words one of the roots is going to be m minus one it's going to be one of the roots
so you just have to look at it and see if you can get one value by just looking at at what values you
can put in for m looking at the constant coefficients to see what is going to happen which means we've
got to do long division so it's silly to do i suppose but let's let's do that but remember
m cube plus three m squared plus zero m minus four we have to have this decreasing order in your
polynomial there and don't forget that zero that zero there so if we do long division it's going to be
an m squared which means it's m cubed minus m squared m cubed minus m cubed is zero three minus negative
one that is three plus one so that's four m squared and i bring the zero m down so that is going to be
plus four m plus four m which will be four m squared minus four m so that this minus that this minus
that so zero minus negative four is plus four four m and i bring the negative four down which leaves me
with a positive four it seems so that's going to be four m minus four so my remainder is zero so i know
my roots are m minus one and then this m squared plus four m plus four and this is much easier
natural for us to do and with our growing up with these kind of polynomials at school etc it looks like
it's going to be an m m plus two squared now we've got a bit of an issue because now we have mixed
values for m because m sub one is going to be one and m sub two equals m sub three equals negative two
so how would we reconstruct so don't worry about it's not that difficult we're going to write e to the
y equals some constant and sub one e to the power just that x there one x plus c sub two is now going
to start off this sequence of getting the x in there as well but the first one remember has no x
so it's going to be e to the power negative two x plus c sub three now we start this x e to the power
negative two x so it's not that it's not that uh that difficult to do so first deal with a one
uh one of the all your values for m sub uh start well like the m sub one which is one so that's going
c sub one e to the power one x and then start this sequence of having to put the x in so the first
was x to the power zero and then x to the power one okay
