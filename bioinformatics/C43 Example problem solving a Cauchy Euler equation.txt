Okay, let's have a look at this problem.
Simple type so that we can just get a few under our belt. We have to realize first of all it
is linear, homogeneous, non-constant coefficients and we do see though that it is of the special
Cauchy-Euler equation. Again, apologies for the pronunciation there. So, what do we know
about these? Well, the important thing about this is to know that the solutions are going
to be in this form and I can write this x to the power m minus 1 and y prime prime is going
to be an m squared minus m and an x to the power m minus 2. I can now substitute it in
there. x squared times x to the power m minus 2 just leaves me an x to the power m and I'm
left with m squared minus m minus 2 times y is x to the power m equals 0. Remember I take
x sub m out as a common factor so I'm left with m squared minus m minus 2 equals 0. That
means, or I can divide both sides by x to the power m, taking for granted that this term
does not equal 0. In other words, I'm going to be left with m minus, what would it be, m
plus 1, m minus 2 is going to equal 0. In other words, m sub 1 equals negative 1 and m sub
2 equals 2. And I do remember that my answers have got to be in this form. So y is going to
equal c sub 1 x to the power negative 1 plus c sub 2 x to the power 2. As simple as that.
