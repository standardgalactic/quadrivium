The text provides an explanation of homomorphisms through three examples involving different types of mathematical groups and functions mapping between them.

1. **First Example:**
   - Groups \( g \) and \( h \) are considered, where:
     - \( g \) is the set of integers under addition.
     - \( h \) consists of the fourth roots of unity (\( 1, -1, i, -i \)) under multiplication.
   - A function \( f: g \to h \) maps any integer \( x \) to \( i^x \).
   - To determine if this is a homomorphism:
     - Consider integers \( a, b, c \in g \) such that \( a + b = c \).
     - Under the function \( f \), \( f(a) = i^a \), \( f(b) = i^b \), and \( f(c) = i^c \).
     - The property \( f(a)f(b) = f(c) \) translates to \( i^a \cdot i^b = i^{a+b} = i^c \).
     - This holds due to the properties of exponents, confirming that \( f \) is a homomorphism.

2. **Second Example:**
   - Groups \( g \) and \( h \) are:
     - \( g \) as the set of real numbers under addition.
     - \( h \) as complex numbers with norm 1 (unit circle in the complex plane) under multiplication.
   - Function \( f: g \to h \) maps any real number \( x \) to \( e^{ix} \).
   - To show \( h \) is a group:
     - **Closure:** Multiplying two elements \( z_1, z_2 \in h \) results in another element with norm 1.
     - **Associativity and Identity:** Follow from complex number multiplication properties; identity is \( 1 + 0i \).
     - **Inverses:** The inverse of any \( z = a + bi \) (with \( |z| = 1 \)) is its complex conjugate.
   - For homomorphism verification:
     - Given \( a, b, c \in g \) such that \( a + b = c \), the function maps \( f(a) = e^{ia} \), \( f(b) = e^{ib} \), and \( f(c) = e^{ic} \).
     - The property \( f(a)f(b) = f(c) \) translates to \( e^{ia} \cdot e^{ib} = e^{i(a+b)} = e^{ic} \), confirming \( f \) is a homomorphism.

3. **Third Example:**
   - The text mentions a group mapping onto itself but does not provide specific details or calculations for this example.

Overall, the text illustrates how to verify whether a function between two groups preserves the group operation, thereby being a homomorphism.

The text discusses whether a specific function \( f \) is a homomorphism between the group \((\mathbb{R}, +)\), which consists of all real numbers under addition. The function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) maps each element \( x \) to its square, i.e., \( f(x) = x^2 \).

To determine if \( f \) is a homomorphism, the text examines whether it preserves the group operation. Specifically, for any elements \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{R} \), where \( a + b = c \) under addition, we must have:

\[ f(a) + f(b) = f(c). \]

Substituting the mapping \( f(x) = x^2 \), this becomes:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2. \]

However, since \( c = a + b \), we have:

\[ c^2 = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. \]

For \( f \) to be a homomorphism, it must hold that:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0 = 2ab, \]

which is not true for all real numbers \( a \) and \( b \). Therefore, the condition fails due to the presence of the \( 2ab \) term, leading to a contradiction.

As a result, \( f(x) = x^2 \) does not preserve the group operation under addition, meaning it is not a homomorphism. The text concludes with an example showing that mapping from a set to itself can fail to maintain the group structure if the function does not satisfy the homomorphism condition.

The text explains how to determine if a function between two algebraic structures (groups) is a homomorphism. A homomorphism is a map that respects the operations of these structures, meaning it preserves their algebraic properties.

**Example 1:**
- **Groups:** \( g \) and \( h \)
- **Group \( g \):** Set of integers under addition.
- **Group \( h \):** Set of roots of unity (i.e., \( 1, -1, i, -i \)) under multiplication.
- **Function \( f \):** Maps each integer \( x \) in \( g \) to \( i^x \) in \( h \).
- **Verification:** For integers \( a, b, c \) where \( a + b = c \), the mapping satisfies \( i^a \times i^b = i^{a+b} = i^c \). This confirms that \( f \) is a homomorphism since it preserves addition in \( g \) and multiplication in \( h \).

**Example 2:**
- **Groups:** \( g \) and \( h \)
- **Group \( g \):** Set of real numbers under addition.
- **Group \( h \):** Complex numbers with norm 1, under multiplication.
- **Function \( f \):** Maps each real number \( x \) in \( g \) to \( e^{ix} \) in \( h \).
- **Verification:** The text verifies that \( h \) is a group by showing closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. For any \( a, b, c \) where \( a + b = c \), the function satisfies \( e^{ia} \times e^{ib} = e^{i(a+b)} = e^{ic} \). Thus, \( f \) is a homomorphism.

**Example 3:**
- **Groups:** A group onto itself.
- The text does not provide specifics for this example but implies that verifying a self-map as a homomorphism involves checking if the map preserves the group operation within the same structure.

Overall, to confirm a function is a homomorphism between two groups, it must preserve the respective operations of those groups.

The text discusses whether a specific function \( f \) is a group homomorphism. The context involves two groups \( g \) and \( h \), where both are the set of all real numbers with addition as their binary operation. The function in question maps each element \( x \) to \( x^2 \).

To determine if \( f \) is a homomorphism, we need to check whether it preserves the group operation, which is addition in this case. Specifically, for any elements \( a \) and \( b \) in the group, the function should satisfy:

\[ f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b). \]

Applying \( f \), we have:
- \( f(a) = a^2 \)
- \( f(b) = b^2 \)
- \( f(c) = c^2 \), where \( c = a + b \)

For \( f \) to be a homomorphism, it must hold that:

\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2. \]

However, expanding the left side using the binomial theorem gives:

\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. \]

This shows that \( a^2 + b^2 \neq (a + b)^2 \) because of the additional \( 2ab \) term. Thus, \( f(a + b) \neq f(a) + f(b) \), indicating that \( f \) does not preserve the group operation.

Therefore, \( f(x) = x^2 \) is not a homomorphism from the real numbers under addition to itself, as it fails to maintain the structure of the group.
