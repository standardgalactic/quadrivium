The text outlines a mathematical argument demonstrating that a certain set, defined as an equivalence class under a specific relation in the context of group theory, corresponds to a left coset. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Setting and Goal**: We are working with a group \( G \) and its subgroup \( H \). The goal is to show that for any element \( A \) in \( G \), an equivalence class defined by a specific relation is equivalent to the set of all elements formed by composing \( A \) with every element of \( H \).

2. **Equivalence Class**: This equivalence class includes elements \( X \) such that the composition of \( X^{-1} \) (the inverse of \( X \)) and \( A \) belongs to \( H \). The text asserts this relation is an equivalence relation because it satisfies properties like symmetry.

3. **Showing Subset Relations**:
   - First, it shows that any element \( X \) in the equivalence class can be expressed as \( AH \), where \( H \) is any element of \( H \).
   - Next, it demonstrates that if \( X \) can be written as \( aH \) (where \( a \in A \)), then it satisfies the equivalence relation defining the original equivalence class.

4. **Conclusion**: By proving both subset relations, it concludes that the equivalence class and the set defined by left cosets are indeed equal. This is significant for further mathematical developments like Lagrange's theorem in group theory, which relates subgroup sizes to group order.

In essence, the text presents a proof showing how an abstract equivalence relation corresponds concretely to the concept of left cosets in group theory.

The text outlines a mathematical argument demonstrating that two sets related by an equivalence relation in group theory are equivalent. Specifically, it shows the equivalence between left cosets of a subgroup \( H \) and elements of an equivalence class defined through an inverse composition operation within a group \( G \).

Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to prove that two sets—elements of an equivalence class under a specific relation in \( G \), and left cosets of \( H \) with respect to an element \( A \)—are equivalent.

2. **Equivalence Relation**: The text defines an equivalence relation where for elements \( A, B \in G \), if the inverse of \( A \) composed with \( B \) belongs to a subgroup \( H \), then they are related by this equivalence class.

3. **Subset Proof Strategy**:
   - To demonstrate two sets are equivalent, it's necessary to show that each is a subset of the other.
   - For an element \( X \) in the equivalence class defined by \( A^{-1}X \in H \), it is shown that this implies \( X = AH \) for some \( h \in H \).
   - Conversely, for any element \( X \) in a left coset \( AH \), where \( h \in H \), it can be deduced that \( A^{-1}X \in H \).

4. **Conclusion**: By demonstrating mutual subset relationships between these sets, their equivalence is established. This forms the basis of understanding cosets and will lead to further concepts like Lagrange’s theorem in group theory.

This proof illustrates foundational ideas in abstract algebra, particularly about subgroup structure within a group \( G \).
