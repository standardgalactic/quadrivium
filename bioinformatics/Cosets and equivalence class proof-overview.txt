The text outlines a mathematical argument demonstrating that a certain set, defined as an equivalence class under a specific relation in the context of group theory, corresponds to a left coset. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Setting and Goal**: We are working with a group \( G \) and its subgroup \( H \). The goal is to show that for any element \( A \) in \( G \), an equivalence class defined by a specific relation is equivalent to the set of all elements formed by composing \( A \) with every element of \( H \).

2. **Equivalence Class**: This equivalence class includes elements \( X \) such that the composition of \( X^{-1} \) (the inverse of \( X \)) and \( A \) belongs to \( H \). The text asserts this relation is an equivalence relation because it satisfies properties like symmetry.

3. **Showing Subset Relations**:
   - First, it shows that any element \( X \) in the equivalence class can be expressed as \( AH \), where \( H \) is any element of \( H \).
   - Next, it demonstrates that if \( X \) can be written as \( aH \) (where \( a \in A \)), then it satisfies the equivalence relation defining the original equivalence class.

4. **Conclusion**: By proving both subset relations, it concludes that the equivalence class and the set defined by left cosets are indeed equal. This is significant for further mathematical developments like Lagrange's theorem in group theory, which relates subgroup sizes to group order.

In essence, the text presents a proof showing how an abstract equivalence relation corresponds concretely to the concept of left cosets in group theory.
