The text explains a linear algebra example where eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 3x3 matrix \( A \) are determined. The process begins by finding the characteristic equation using the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \), leading to a polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues. For this specific case, there are two repeated eigenvalues (\( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -1 \)) and one distinct eigenvalue (\( \lambda_3 = 5 \)).

For the repeated eigenvalue \( \lambda = -1 \), multiple eigenvectors exist, forming a set of solutions with two linearly independent vectors. Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination is used to find these eigenvectors. For the distinct eigenvalue \( \lambda = 5 \), only one eigenvector is needed and found similarly.

The general solution combines exponential terms associated with each eigenvalue and their corresponding eigenvectors: 

- Two solutions involving \( e^{-t} \) multiplied by the linearly independent eigenvectors for \( \lambda = -1 \).
- One solution involving \( e^{5t} \) multiplied by its eigenvector for \( \lambda = 5 \).

The text concludes that when repeated real eigenvalues have multiple eigenvectors, complex solutions are unnecessary, unlike cases with fewer independent eigenvectors than expected.
