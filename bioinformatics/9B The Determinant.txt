To continue on this lecture series on linear algebra, we're going to switch over to the blackboard.
And just to recap a bit on the previous videos, I want to revisit the issue of the determinant of a matrix.
Very important to get the determinant of a matrix because we're going to use the equation,
and let's put it up here, that the inverse of a matrix is 1 over the determinant of that matrix times the adjoint of that matrix.
So we must definitely need the determinant, and we also know that if the determinant is 0,
that matrix is singular inasmuch as it does not have an inverse.
So let's look at the determinant of this 3 by 3 matrix.
Remember, if we're looking at this, we're looking at square matrices.
So this is a 3 by 3 matrix, 1, 3, 2 in the first row, 0, 1, 2 in the second, 1, 1, 4 in the third row.
Now we're going to choose either row or a column to get the determinant of the matrix,
and we're going to choose either row or a column with the most zeros.
We see column 1 has a 0 in it, and luckily for us it's a 1 and a 1, so that's quite easy.
So the first thing we're going to do is write the A in row 1, column 1 equals 1,
and the entry in row 3, 1, column 1 equals also 1.
Now if we had to look at the matrix of minus for 1, 1, so that's row 1, column 1,
that, in other words we're going to close column 1, we're going to close row 1, we're left with this matrix,
and remember we're going to do AD minus BC, so it's 1 times 4 is 4, minus 2 is 2, so that's going to equal 2.
And for the matrix of minus of row 3, column 1, so we're going to close row 3, we're going to close column 1,
so we're left with this 2 by 2 matrix, 3 times 2 is 6, minus 2 equals 4.
And if we look at the matrix of cofactors for row 1, column 1, and for row 3, column 1,
now remember the pluses and minuses, but it's easy if you just add 1 and 1 is 2,
and that is an even number, so that will stay exactly the same.
3 and 1 is 4, that's also an equal number, so we are left with that also equal, equally 4.
And remember though then, that the determinant of A is going to be, for us, A11, C11, times A31, times C31,
so for us that's going to equal 6.
And that's an easy way for us to get to the determinant of our 3 by 3 matrix.
Now we know that the determinant of our matrix A is 6.
What if I multiply this matrix by the scalar?
So we're going to look at Ka.
Do we have an equation for the determinant?
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
The determinant of K times A is going to equal K to the power N times the determinant of A.
K is our scalar, and N is the size of the matrix.
It's a 3 by 3 matrix, so we're going to have N equals 3 here.
So let's look at this, let's multiply matrix A by 3.
So 3 times matrix A, that's going to equal 3, 9, 6, 0, 3, 6, 3, 3, 12.
So that's our new matrix.
First, then again, we're going to choose a row or column with zeros in it.
If we can, then there is one, so we're going to do column 1.
So we're looking at position row 1, column 1.
We don't need 2 because we're going to then multiply out by zeros,
so we also need row 3, column 1.
That is a 3 and that is a 3.
So in the matrix of minus row 1, column 1, matrix of minus row 3, column 1.
We change 2.
So we're going to close column 1, row 1.
3 times 12, I've got it on the board there somewhere.
3 times 12, did I do it some way, did I do it some way?
Minus 18, 36 minus 18 is 18, that's easy enough.
And we're going to close row 3, column 1.
So we left with 9 times 6 is 54 minus 18.
Do I have it there?
I think, yeah, that's 36.
Again, for the matrix of coefficients, position row 1, column 1, row 3, column 1,
that is still going to remain 18 and that is going to remain 36.
And the determinant now, twice is going to be 3 times 18 plus 3 times 36.
And do I have it on the board there?
Yes, that equals 162.
And so the determinant of 3 times A equals 162.
But let's see if we take this formula of ours.
We're going to have 3 to the power 3 times the determinant of A, which was 6.
So we're going to have 27 times 6.
7 times 6 is 42.
12 and 16 is 162, which is 162.
Next, we're just going to have a look at some other, if we have another matrix B, if we look
at the determinant of A plus B, then we're going to see that there isn't really an easy way
and it's not necessarily going to be the determinant of A plus the determinant of B separately.
It doesn't always work out like that.
So we're not going to have a fixed equation for that determinant and we'll have to work out
first addition of the matrix and then we'll have a new matrix and we'll have to take the determinant of that new matrix.
Now let's have a look if there's an equation for the determinant of AB.
If we multiply two matrices and we see the C and D that is the determinant of A times the determinant of B.
Let's have a look.
Let's have a look.
Two square matrices and then as much as they're 2 by 2 matrices, let's just first look quickly
at what the matrix AB is going to be.
So we're going to take the first row, multiply it by the first column.
3 times minus 1 is negative 1.
1 times 5 is 5.
3 times negative 1 is negative 3.
So that'll leave us with a 2.
First row, second column, 3 times 3 is 9.
And 9 and 8 is 17.
Then we're going to have second row, first column, negative 2 and a 5.
That'll give us 3.
Second row, second column, 6 and 8 is going to give us a 14.
Let's look at what the determinant of A is for a 2 by 2 matrix.
So this is going to be AD minus BC.
So that's 3 minus 2 and that equals 1.
If we look at what the determinant of B is going to be, that is negative 8 minus 15.
Negative 8 minus, is negative 23.
So negative 23.
And let's look what the determinant of AB is.
And what we are saying is that that should equal negative 23.
And let's see.
We're going to have the determinant of matrix AB.
And we're going to have 2 times 14 is 28 minus 51.
And I'll see if you point that into your calculator or do it by hand,
you'll see that it's exactly negative 23 as well.
I went to an example of this, but the next step for next consideration for our determinant
is going to be the determinant of the inverse of our matrix.
And that says that if matrix A is invertible,
that is going to equal 1 over the determinant of A.
And that's why I say it's got to be invertible inasmuch as we don't want this to be 0,
we can't divide by 0.
So the determinant of the inverse of a matrix equals 1 over the determinant of that original matrix.
