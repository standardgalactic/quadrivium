The text outlines two methods for evaluating the area highlighted in red, which involves integrating a region bounded by a circle and other geometric shapes.

### Method 1:
1. **Divide into Simpler Shapes:** Consider splitting the complex shape into simpler geometric components (e.g., rectangles, triangles) to simplify integration.
2. **Integration Setup:** The area is calculated using integral calculus with respect to \( y \). This involves integrating over a function derived from the circle's equation.

### Method 2:
1. **Trigonometric Substitution:**
   - Use trigonometric identities and substitutions to convert the problem into an integration involving angles (e.g., \( \theta \)).
   - Utilize relationships such as \( \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) \).

2. **Integration Process:**
   - Integrate with respect to \( \theta \), which involves terms like \( \frac{1}{2}\theta + \frac{1}{4}\sin(2\theta) \).
   - Convert back from trigonometric functions to the original variables using relationships derived from a unit circle, such as \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{a} \) and \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{a} \).

3. **Final Expression:**
   - Substitute back to express the result in terms of \( a \) (the radius of the circle) and \( y \).
   - The final integral expression is evaluated from 0 to \( b \), where \( b \) represents the upper limit for integration with respect to \( y \).

This approach allows solving the problem using both geometric and trigonometric methods, providing flexibility in tackling complex areas bounded by curves.

The text discusses a mathematical process involving substitutions in an integral. The original interval is from 0 to \(b\), but due to substitutions, the interval remains unchanged. The expression involves distributing \(a^2\) into two terms: 

1. \(\frac{a^2}{2} \times \arcsin\left(\frac{y}{a}\right)\)
2. \(\frac{y \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2}\)

These are combined over the interval from 0 to \(b\) with a common denominator of 2, resulting in:

\[
\frac{a^2 \arcsin\left(\frac{y}{a}\right) + y \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2}
\]

The text ends by questioning if this process is slower, suggesting some concern about the efficiency or complexity of the substitution and integration steps.

The text provides a detailed solution for evaluating the area of a red-shaded region related to a circle with equation \( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \). The solution involves two approaches:

1. **Direct Integration Approach**:
   - Initially, the problem suggests calculating the area by integrating directly in terms of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - This involves splitting the region into simpler geometric shapes or using standard integration techniques.

2. **Trigonometric Substitution Approach**:
   - The second approach uses trigonometric substitution to simplify the integral.
   - By expressing \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of trigonometric functions (using a unit circle parameterization), the problem becomes easier to handle.
   - Specifically, substitutions like \( x = a \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = a \sin(\theta) \) are used.
   - The integral is then transformed into one involving trigonometric identities, such as the double angle identity for sine.

3. **Back-Substitution**:
   - After integrating in terms of the trigonometric variable (\( \theta \)), the solution involves back-substituting to express the result in terms of \( a \) and \( y \).
   - This requires using inverse trigonometric functions, like arcsine, to revert from \( \theta \) to \( y/a \).

4. **Final Expression**:
   - The final expression for the area involves combining these results, ensuring all terms are expressed in terms of the original variables \( a \) and \( y \).
   - The solution concludes with evaluating the definite integral from 0 to \( b \), where \( b \) is likely a boundary condition related to the problem's geometry.

Overall, the text outlines a comprehensive method for solving the area problem using both algebraic and trigonometric techniques.

The text describes a mathematical process involving an interval originally set from 0 to \( b \). Due to substitutions made during this process, there is an expectation that the interval might change. However, since the values are substituted back into the original variables \( a \) and \( y \), the interval remains from 0 to \( b \).

The expression involves distributing \( a^2 \) across two terms:
1. \( a^2 \times \frac{\text{arc sine of } \frac{y}{a}}{2} \)
2. \( \frac{y \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2} \)

After distribution, the expression becomes:
- \( \frac{a^2 \cdot \text{arc sine of } \frac{y}{a}}{2} + \frac{y \cdot \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2} \)

Both terms are combined over a common denominator of 2, resulting in:
- \( \frac{a^2 \cdot \text{arc sine of } \frac{y}{a} + y \cdot \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2} \)

This expression is evaluated from 0 to \( b \). The text ends with a rhetorical question about the process being slower, but it lacks context or further elaboration.
