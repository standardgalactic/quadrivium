The text outlines two methods for evaluating the area highlighted in red, which involves integrating a region bounded by a circle and other geometric shapes.

### Method 1:
1. **Divide into Simpler Shapes:** Consider splitting the complex shape into simpler geometric components (e.g., rectangles, triangles) to simplify integration.
2. **Integration Setup:** The area is calculated using integral calculus with respect to \( y \). This involves integrating over a function derived from the circle's equation.

### Method 2:
1. **Trigonometric Substitution:**
   - Use trigonometric identities and substitutions to convert the problem into an integration involving angles (e.g., \( \theta \)).
   - Utilize relationships such as \( \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) \).

2. **Integration Process:**
   - Integrate with respect to \( \theta \), which involves terms like \( \frac{1}{2}\theta + \frac{1}{4}\sin(2\theta) \).
   - Convert back from trigonometric functions to the original variables using relationships derived from a unit circle, such as \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{a} \) and \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{a} \).

3. **Final Expression:**
   - Substitute back to express the result in terms of \( a \) (the radius of the circle) and \( y \).
   - The final integral expression is evaluated from 0 to \( b \), where \( b \) represents the upper limit for integration with respect to \( y \).

This approach allows solving the problem using both geometric and trigonometric methods, providing flexibility in tackling complex areas bounded by curves.

The text discusses a mathematical process involving substitutions in an integral. The original interval is from 0 to \(b\), but due to substitutions, the interval remains unchanged. The expression involves distributing \(a^2\) into two terms: 

1. \(\frac{a^2}{2} \times \arcsin\left(\frac{y}{a}\right)\)
2. \(\frac{y \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2}\)

These are combined over the interval from 0 to \(b\) with a common denominator of 2, resulting in:

\[
\frac{a^2 \arcsin\left(\frac{y}{a}\right) + y \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2}
\]

The text ends by questioning if this process is slower, suggesting some concern about the efficiency or complexity of the substitution and integration steps.
