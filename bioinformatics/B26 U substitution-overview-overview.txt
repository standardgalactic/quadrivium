The text outlines a method to solve an initial value problem involving differential equations by employing a strategic substitution. The original equation involves both \( y \) and \( x \), making it challenging to solve directly. By substituting \( u = -2x + y \), the equation is transformed into one with variables \( u \) and \( x \), allowing separation of variables.

The derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is rewritten using the chain rule, leading to a new form: 

\[
2 + \frac{du}{dx} = u^2 - 7
\]

This can be rearranged for variable separation:

\[
\frac{1}{u-3} - \frac{1}{6(u+3)} \, du = dx
\]

Integrating both sides results in:

\[
\ln \left|\frac{u-3}{u+3}\right| = 6x + c_2
\]

Exponentiating gives:

\[
\frac{u-3}{u+3} = C e^{6x}
\]

Solving for \( u \) yields:

\[
u = \frac{3(1 + Ce^{6x})}{1 - Ce^{6x}}
\]

Re-substituting \( u = -2x + y \), we find:

\[
y = 2x + \frac{3(1 + Ce^{6x})}{1 - Ce^{6x}}
\]

Applying the initial condition \( x = 0, y = 0 \) determines \( C = -1 \). The final solution is:

\[
y = 2x + \frac{3(1 - e^{6x})}{1 + e^{6x}}
\]

The text highlights that such substitutions require insight and practice, as there's no straightforward method for choosing the right substitution.
