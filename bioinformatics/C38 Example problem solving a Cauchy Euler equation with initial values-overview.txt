The text describes solving a differential equation with complex roots using a substitution method. Here's a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: The differential equation involves terms like \(x^2 y'' + 17xy = 0\). To solve it, the substitution \(y = x^m\) is suggested.

2. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - By substituting \(y = x^m\), derivatives are calculated as \(y' = mx^{m-1}\) and \(y'' = m(m-1)x^{m-2}\).
   - Substituting these into the equation results in a polynomial in terms of \(x\) that simplifies to \(4m^2 - 4m + 17 = 0\).

3. **Solving for \(m\)**:
   - The quadratic equation \(4m^2 - 4m + 17 = 0\) is solved using the quadratic formula, resulting in complex roots.
   - The discriminant is negative, leading to complex solutions: \(m = \frac{1}{2} \pm i\sqrt{\frac{15}{4}}\).

4. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution involves complex exponentials or trigonometric functions due to the imaginary part of \(m\).
   - It is expressed as \(y = x^{1/2}(C_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{2} \ln x) + C_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{2} \ln x))\).

5. **Initial Value Problem**:
   - Given initial conditions, constants \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are determined.
   - The specific solution is found to be \(y = -x^{1/2} \cos(2 \ln x)\) after applying the initial condition.

6. **Graphical Representation**:
   - The solution is graphed for positive \(x\), as the natural logarithm is undefined for non-positive values.
   - The graph shows the behavior of the function over its domain.

This process highlights solving a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients, leading to complex roots and solutions involving trigonometric functions.

The text describes solving a differential equation with complex roots. Initially, the substitution \( y = x^m \) leads to a characteristic equation: 

\[ 4m^2 - 4m + 17 = 0. \]

Solving this yields complex roots for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{1}{2} \pm 2i. \]

The general solution of the differential equation is expressed using these roots:

\[ y = x^{1/2}(c_1 \cos(2 \ln x) + c_2 \sin(2 \ln x)). \]

Given an initial condition \( y(1) = 1 \), the text solves for constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). It finds that:

\[ c_1 = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad c_2 = 0. \]

Thus, the particular solution to the initial value problem is:

\[ y = -x^{1/2} \cos(2 \ln x). \]

This solution is valid for \( x > 0 \) due to the natural logarithm's domain restrictions.
