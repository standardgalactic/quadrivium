Now we've just seen scalar multiplication with a complex number
An example of that
Now let's look at multiplication of two complex numbers
So it's not k times a plus bi
But I have a multiplication of two complex numbers
So we have a plus bi and c plus di
Now up till now we've had addition, we've had subtraction and we had scalar multiplication
Those are analogous to what we had before in R2 space as far as vectors were concerned
Analogous
This is the different components on a two axis coordinate system
And we just add subtract them and if we multiply it by a vector
And if we multiply it by a scalar for instance
We're just going to make it longer or in a negative direction or shorter
Whatever the case may be
And if I have two vectors and I add or subtract them
This is going to be head to tail, head to tail and that's my answer
Or I'm going to add to that the negative of this if I subtract
So my answer was going to be in that direction
Okay, so it's all analogous to R2 space
This has no analogy though in R2 space
This complex number of multiplication and it boils down to basic algebra
Because we could before, if we just looked at a plus b and c plus d
If we had to multiply those out it would be ac plus bc plus ad plus bd
Okay, it was easy to do
Okay, it was easy to do
It was as we learned in school
That one multiplied by that one and that one multiplied by those two
It was easy to do
The same concept here, nothing too mysterious
I'm going to have ac plus I'm going to have an adi plus I'm going to have a cvi plus I'm going to have a vdi squared
But I remember my property of complex of imaginary numbers in that a squared equals negative 1
So I'm going to have ac plus
Now with these two I can take up i as a common factor
So I'm going to have ad plus cbi
And I'm going to have negative 1 for that so minus bd
In other words, I'm going to have ac minus bd plus I'm going to have ad plus cbi
So quite simple to multiply two complex numbers by each other
Now let's have this example
3 plus 2i times 4 plus 5i
The multiplication of two complex numbers
Once again, it's just going to be the simple algebraic multiplication
With the added property of i squared being negative 1
So I'm going to have 3 times force 12
Plus I'm going to have 15i
Plus I'm going to have another 8i
Plus I'm going to have a 10i squared
That is going to give me 12
Plus 15 and 8 is 23i
Minus 10
That leads me to 12 minus 10 is 2
Plus 23i
Our first example
Now our next example
Very easy, 4 times 2 is 8
I'm going to have a negative 12i
And a negative 2i
And a positive 3i squared
Which makes that a negative 3
8 minus 3 is 5
Minus 14i
Indeed, we can show that complex numbers share all the normal algebraic properties
As much as
I can have
associative properties
I mean
Commutative properties
Z2 plus Z1
Those will be the same
It will be the same
It will commute also for multiplication
Equals Z2 Z1
Z2 Z1
We can have addition
And association
Associative laws
Inasmuch as if I have Z1
Plus Z2
Plus Z3
That is going to be the same as Z1
Plus Z2
And then adding a Z3
That's associative
It also has multiplication
Associative properties
In other words Z1
Z2 times Z3
It will be the same as Z1
Z2 times Z3
Z3 in the end
There
And it will also
Distribute
In other words
If I have Z1
And I have Z2
Plus Z3
I'm going to have Z1 Z2
Plus Z1 Z3
Z1 Z3
Okay
If I have
0 times Z1
That is going to be 0
If I have a negative times Z1
That is going to be negative Z1
That's going to be negative Z1
That's going to be negative Z1
And then finally
If I have Z1
And I add to that the negative of Z1
I'm going to have 0
I'm going to have 0
So there's
Distributive properties there
There's associative properties
And multiplication in addition there
And there is commutative properties
It does commute as far as addition
And multiplication is concerned
With those laws or properties in mind
Let's do this problem
I have i
Times 1 plus i
Times 1 minus negative i
So I can
Associate these two first
To them
So we have i times
1 times 1 is 1
I have a negative 2i
A positive i
And I have a negative 2i squared
That is going to leave me
With an i there
We're going to have 1
That's going to be negative
So that's 1
That's going to be 3
And this is going to be minus i
And this leaves me with a 3i
And a negative i squared
Which becomes a 1
That is 1 plus 3i
One more fact about complex numbers
Is there's no size ordering
In other words
No complex number is greater than
Or equal to
Or equal to
Or greater than
Or just greater than
Or smaller than
There are no comparative
No size comparison
Between complex numbers
So none of this apply
In the next section
We'll just look at
Some very simple matrix algebra
As far as complex numbers are concerned
We'll see
We'll see
We'll see
