This video provides an overview of the recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) and the superior laryngeal nerve, emphasizing their significance in laryngeal functions such as swallowing, breathing, coughing, and phonation. The RLNs stem from the vagus nerve, with different anatomical courses: the left RLN loops under the aortic arch, while the right one wraps around the subclavian artery; an anomaly like a non-recurrent right RLN can occur due to an abnormal right subclavian artery.

The RLNs enter the larynx behind the inferior constrictor muscle and the cricothyroid joint, innervating muscles that control vocal cord movement. They are vulnerable to injuries from thermal damage, cutting, stretching, compression, or vascular compromise, particularly during thyroidectomy due to factors like malignancy, previous surgeries, or scarring.

Injury complications range from temporary to permanent paralysis, though most cases recover over time. Risk management strategies include identifying the nerves intraoperatively, possibly with monitoring, preoperative vocal cord function assessment, and ensuring patient consent is informed. Non-surgical causes of RLN paralysis can be due to tumors or intubation trauma.

The superior laryngeal nerve splits into sensory and motor branches, with the motor branch being vital for voice quality by innervating the cricothyroid muscle. Damage can occur if the superior thyroid artery is improperly managed during surgery.
