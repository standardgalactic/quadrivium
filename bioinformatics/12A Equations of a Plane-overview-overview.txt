To find the equation of a plane given three points in space, follow these steps:

### Given Points
Denote the points as \( P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) \), \( P_2(x_2, y_2, z_2) \), and \( P_3(x_3, y_3, z_3) \).

### Step 1: Find Two Vectors in the Plane
Create two vectors from these points:
- Vector \( \mathbf{v_1} = P_2 - P_1 = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1) \)
- Vector \( \mathbf{v_2} = P_3 - P_1 = (x_3 - x_1, y_3 - y_1, z_3 - z_1) \)

### Step 2: Find the Normal Vector
Calculate the normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \) using the cross product of \( \mathbf{v_1} \) and \( \mathbf{v_2} \):
\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v_1} \times \mathbf{v_2} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
x_2 - x_1 & y_2 - y_1 & z_2 - z_1 \\
x_3 - x_1 & y_3 - y_1 & z_3 - z_1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Components of the normal vector:
- \( n_x = (y_2 - y_1)(z_3 - z_1) - (z_2 - z_1)(y_3 - y_1) \)
- \( n_y = (z_2 - z_1)(x_3 - x_1) - (x_2 - x_1)(z_3 - z_1) \)
- \( n_z = (x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (y_2 - y_1)(x_3 - x_1) \)

### Step 3: Equation of the Plane
Use the normal vector \( \mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z) \) and point \( P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) \) to form the plane equation:
\[
n_x(x - x_1) + n_y(y - y_1) + n_z(z - z_1) = 0
\]

Simplify to:
\[
n_xx + n_yy + n_zz = d
\]
where \( d = n_xx_1 + n_yy_1 + n_zz_1 \).

### Example
For points \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \), \( P_2(2, 3, 1) \), and \( P_3(3, 2, 2) \):

1. Vectors:
   - \( \mathbf{v_1} = (1, 1, 2) \)
   - \( \mathbf{v_2} = (2, 0, 3) \)

2. Normal vector:
   \[
   \mathbf{n} = 
   \begin{vmatrix}
   \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
   1 & 1 & 2 \\
   2 & 0 & 3
   \end{vmatrix}
   = (1, -1, -2)
   \]

3. Plane equation:
   \[
   1(x - 1) - 1(y - 2) - 2(z + 1) = 0
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x - y - 2z = 3
   \]

The text also discusses different forms of the plane equation, focusing on point-normal form and vector form. The point-normal form uses a known point and normal vector, while the vector form involves using vectors from the origin to points on the plane, ensuring perpendicularity with the normal vector through dot product conditions.
