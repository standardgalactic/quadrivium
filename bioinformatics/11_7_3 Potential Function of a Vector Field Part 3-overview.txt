The text outlines a method for determining whether a given three-dimensional vector field has a potential function and how to find that potential if it exists. The vector field components are described as:

1. \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2yz + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + xz^2 \)
2. \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xz + \frac{1}{2}yz^2 + xy \)
3. \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 2xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2z + x^2z \)

To determine if a potential function exists, one must verify that the mixed partial derivatives of these components are consistent (a condition implied by assuming the existence of a Jacobian matrix). Assuming this is satisfied, the process involves integrating each component with respect to its variable while treating other variables as constants.

Steps include:

1. **Integrate** \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \) with respect to \( x \):
   - Result: \( f(x, y, z) = 2xyz + \frac{1}{2}xy^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3z^2 + g(y, z) \)
   - Here, \( g(y, z) \) is an arbitrary function of \( y \) and \( z \), since differentiation with respect to \( x \) would eliminate it.

2. **Differentiate** the resulting expression for \( f(x, y, z) \) with respect to \( y \):
   - Result: \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xz + xy + \frac{\partial g(y, z)}{\partial y} \)
   - Set this equal to the given \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) and solve for \( \frac{\partial g(y, z)}{\partial y} \):
     - \( \frac{\partial g(y, z)}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{2}yz^2 \)

3. **Integrate** \( \frac{\partial g(y, z)}{\partial y} \) with respect to \( y \):
   - Result: \( g(y, z) = \frac{1}{4}y^2z^2 + h(z) \)
   - Here, \( h(z) \) is an arbitrary function of \( z \).

4. **Differentiate** the updated expression for \( f(x, y, z) \) with respect to \( z \):
   - Result: \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 2xy + x^2z + \frac{1}{2}y^2z + \frac{dh(z)}{dz} \)
   - Set this equal to the given \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \) and solve for \( \frac{dh(z)}{dz} \):
     - Since all terms match, \( \frac{dh(z)}{dz} = 0 \), implying \( h(z) \) is a constant.

The potential function \( f(x, y, z) \) is thus:
\[ f(x, y, z) = 2xyz + \frac{1}{2}xy^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3z^2 + \frac{1}{4}y^2z^2 + C \]
where \( C \) is a constant. This function satisfies the original vector field's conditions for having a potential.

The text describes a mathematical process where terms in an expression are systematically canceled out. Initially, the expression consists of \(2xy\), \(\frac{1}{2} y^2 z\), and \(x^2 z\). Each term is shown to cancel separately: \(2xy\) cancels with itself, \(x^2 z\) cancels with itself, and \(\frac{1}{2} y^2 z\) cancels with itself. After all terms are canceled, the equation reduces to \(dh/dz = 0\).

This implies that the function \(h(z)\), when differentiated with respect to \(z\), results in zero. The only type of function whose derivative is zero is a constant function. Therefore, \(h(z)\) must be a constant.

The text concludes by stating that this constant function represents the potential function for the given vector field. Additionally, it confirms that taking partial derivatives of this potential function with respect to \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) will yield the original components of the vector field, verifying the correctness of the potential function.

The text outlines a method for finding the potential function \( f(x, y, z) \) of a given vector field in three dimensions. The components of the vector field are provided as partial derivatives:

1. \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2yz + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + xz^2\)
2. \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xz + \frac{1}{2}yz^2 + xy\)
3. \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 2xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2z + x^2z\)

To find \( f(x, y, z) \), the process involves integrating each component with respect to its corresponding variable while treating other variables as constants. Here's a step-by-step summary:

1. **Integrate with respect to \( x \):**
   - Integrate \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2yz + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + xz^2\) with respect to \( x \).
   - Result: \( f(x, y, z) = 2xyz + \frac{1}{2}xy^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^2z^2 + g(y, z) \), where \( g(y, z) \) is an unknown function of \( y \) and \( z \).

2. **Determine \( g(y, z) \) using the derivative with respect to \( y \):**
   - Differentiate \( f(x, y, z) \) with respect to \( y \) and equate it to \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\).
   - Solve for \( \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{2}yz^2 \).
   - Integrate: \( g(y, z) = \frac{1}{4}y^2z^2 + h(z) \), where \( h(z) \) is a function of \( z \).

3. **Determine \( h(z) \) using the derivative with respect to \( z \):**
   - Differentiate \( f(x, y, z) \) with respect to \( z \) and equate it to \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\).
   - Solve for \( \frac{dh}{dz} = 0 \), implying \( h(z) \) is a constant.

4. **Combine results:**
   - The potential function is:
     \[
     f(x, y, z) = 2xyz + \frac{1}{2}xy^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^2z^2 + \frac{1}{4}y^2z^2 + C
     \]
   - Where \( C \) is a constant.

This process ensures that the derived potential function satisfies all given partial derivatives of the vector field.

The text describes a process for finding a potential function \( h \) for a vector field. It starts by considering an expression composed of terms: \( 2xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2z \) and \( x^2z \). Through cancellation, all these terms are reduced to zero, leading to the equation \( dh/dz = 0 \).

This implies that the first derivative of \( h \) with respect to \( z \) is zero, meaning \( h \) must be a constant function because only constants have a derivative of zero. Consequently, \( h(z) \) is identified as a constant.

The text concludes by confirming that this potential function \( h \) satisfies the conditions for the vector field when its partial derivatives with respect to \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) match the original components of the vector field. Thus, \( h \) is confirmed as the potential function for the given vector field.
