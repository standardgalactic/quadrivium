The lecture covers how to use the SymPy library in an IPython notebook for "pretty printing" mathematical symbols, improving their visual representation. Key points include:

1. **Setup**: Pretty printing is enabled by importing SymPy and using `sympy.init_printing()`, which alters output display within the notebook.

2. **Symbols Definition**: Symbols can be defined with Greek letters or other names available in SymPy, facilitating easy manipulation and display (e.g., \( \theta \) for theta).

3. **Expression Display**: 
   - Simple expressions like \( \theta^3 \) are displayed beautifully.
   - Complex algebraic expressions can be factorized neatly, such as displaying \( 2x^2 + xy \) as \( x(2x + y) \).

4. **Integration**:
   - Indefinite integrals (e.g., \(\int x^3 \, dx\)) are printed clearly.
   - Definite integrals from \( a \) to \( b \) can be displayed and computed using `sympy.integrate()`, offering symbolic integration.

5. **Differentiation**:
   - Derivatives, such as the third derivative of \( x + y^3 \) with respect to \( y \), are calculated and formatted elegantly.
   - Both explicit notation (e.g., repeating 'y' for a third derivative) and shorthand methods (`doit()`) are demonstrated.

6. **Special Symbols**: Greek letters and other special characters can be easily mapped to symbols in SymPy, enhancing the clarity of mathematical notation when printed.

The lecture highlights using SymPy's capabilities to improve the readability and presentation of mathematical computations in an IPython notebook.

The lecture discusses how to use the SymPy library for "pretty printing" mathematical expressions in an IPython notebook. The key points include:

1. **Pretty Printing Setup**: By importing SymPy and calling `sympy.init_printing()`, you enhance the visual display of outputs within the notebook.

2. **Defining Symbols**: You can define various symbols, including Greek letters like \( \theta \) (theta), for easier manipulation and display.

3. **Expression Display**:
   - Simple expressions such as \( \theta^3 \) are printed attractively.
   - Complex algebraic expressions can be factorized and neatly displayed, e.g., \( 2x^2 + xy \) as \( x(2x + y) \).

4. **Integration**: 
   - Indefinite integrals like \(\int x^3 \, dx\) are clearly printed.
   - Definite integrals can be displayed and computed using `sympy.integrate()` for symbolic integration.

5. **Differentiation**:
   - Derivatives, such as the third derivative of \( x + y^3 \) with respect to \( y \), are calculated and formatted elegantly.
   - Both explicit notation and shorthand methods (`doit()`) are shown.

6. **Special Symbols**: Greek letters and special characters can be mapped to symbols in SymPy, improving mathematical notation clarity when printed.
