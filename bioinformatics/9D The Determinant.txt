There is one last way of getting the determiner and it's not a method that is often used and it actually predates the other methods, it predates matrices completely.
And that uses combinatorial methods and one of them is called permutations.
What is a permutation? If I have a set of integers, let's have my set A equals 1, 2 and 3, so I have three elements there.
How many ways can I arrange that so that I don't repeat anything and I don't omit anything?
So I can't just have a new set, 1, 2, and I can't have 1, 2, 3 and I can't have 1, 2, 3 again.
So I can't repeat and I can't omit.
And there's one long way of doing it, I can write 1, 2 and 3.
Now if I have 1 here, I only have 2 and 3 left.
I can't have another 1 because I can't repeat so here I can only have a 2 and a 3.
Here I can only have a 1 and a 3 and here I can only have a 1 and a 2, nothing else.
Now from this 2 I already have a 1, I have a 2, so there's nothing but a 3.
So from that 1 I have a 1 and I have a 3, I can have nothing but a 2.
I have a 2 and a 3, I can have nothing but a 1.
I have a 3 and a 1, I can have a 2, I have a 3 and a 2, I can have nothing but a 1.
1. So what do I have? I have 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. I have 1. So that's my 1. I have 1, 3, 2. I have 2, 1, 3.
I have 2, 3, 1. 2, 3, 4. And now I have 3, 1, 2. And lastly, I have 3, 2, 1. So I haven't omitted anything and I haven't repeated anything.
1, 2, 3. 1, 3, 2. There's no other 1, 3, 2. There's no other 2, 1, 3s. There's no other 2, 3, 1s. There's no other 3, 1, 2s. And there's no other 3, 2, 1s.
So how many do I have there? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 permutations. So I have 6 permutations. And there's an easy way to do this.
In my first step, step 1, step 1, I had 3 choices, 3 choices to make. Now I went down to step 2. At step 2, there was only 2 choices to make, times 2.
And in my step 3, from 2, I only had 1 choice. There was just 1 choice left every time, times 1. And then you could really say last, there was nothing left.
There was nothing left. Okay, so what we have here, I'll leave that nothing, because it's a bit silly to say, 3 times 2 times 6.
Now 3 times 2 times 1 equals 6. So what I'm dealing here with is 3 factorial.
So if I have 3 elements there, I have 6. 3 factorial is 3 times 2 times 1. 3 times 2 times 1 equals 6.
I have 6 permutations. Okay, so if I had 1, 2, 3, 4. So in my first one, I have 4. In my second one, I would have 3.
And then I would have 2, and then I would have 1. In other words, I have 4 factorial.
12 problems, 2 equals 24. That would be 24 permutations.
So now that we know what permutations is, in the next video, we'll have a look at how to use this to get to the determinant.
In the second step, I'm going to look at a concept called inversion, and I'm going to classify those inversions as odd or evil.
What does an inversion mean?
If I take any particular or any specific of my permutations, and I look at how many times is an element to the left larger than any of them to the right.
So if I look at this first, I start with a 1. Now I look to the right. Are there any values less than 1?
Any value less than 1 of integers would be 0 that I know.
So that's 0. I take the 2, and again I look right. Is there anything less than 2 to the right? Nothing.
So this permutation, this specific permutation, will have an inversion.
So we will do inversions. Inversions of 0.
Let's look at this one. How many inversions would it have?
Well, there's nothing. There's no 0 to the right, which is the only digit smaller than 1.
So that's 0. I looked at 3. Oh, there's 1, because 2 is smaller than 3.
So I'm looking at this 3, and I'm looking to the right of it.
Is there any smaller integers to the right? So there is one inversion there.
Let's look at this one. There's 2, 1 and 3, so there's 1.
1 is less than 2, so there's one inversion.
1 to 3, that's nothing, so there's one inversion.
2 to 3 to 1, there'll be 2 inversions, because there's 1, 1.
The preceding 2 is larger than the 1, and there's another one.
1 is smaller than 3, so there's 2.
3, there's 1, 2 already. There's 2 inversions.
And 3 to 1, there's 1, 2, 3 inversions.
There's 1, 2, and then for that 2, there's another one. There's 3 inversions.
And if it's an even number or 0, we call this an even inversion.
So that'll be an even inversion, and that'll be a odd inversion.
That'll be a odd inversion.
That'll be an even inversion.
That'll be an even inversion, and that'll be an odd inversion.
So now we know what permutations are.
We know just to use the factorial of the number of elements there are
to tell us how many permutations there's going to be.
And I know now this concept of inversion, and I know how to classify those inversions
as odd or even.
So that is an even permutation.
As far as inversion goes, that's an odd, an odd, an even, and even, and an odd permutation.
Now, we're almost getting there.
Now we're going to look at the elementary product of n times n, or square matrices.
So here I have a 2 by 2 matrix, and a 3 by 3 matrix.
And again, I'm going to look at the different permutations.
So if I have this A1 something, A2 something, but I cannot choose from the same row or column.
So if I made this first one 1, if I made it 1, I'll have A1, 1, but I can't, that's that one,
but I can't choose from the same row or column.
So what is left?
A2, 2, A2, 2.
So that'll make this one a 2.
So there's my first permutation.
And if I make this one a 2, if I make this one a 2, so that means A1, 2, so I can't have
that row or that column, so I'm left with A2, 1, which makes this one a 1.
I hope you understand what I mean by these two.
So this is supplemented there, this one is supplemented there, this one is supplemented
there, this one is supplemented there, such that I can never choose from the same row
or column.
So if I make this empty space a 1, that is A1, 1 there, I cannot choose from that row
or that column, so the only thing left is A2, 2, which makes this 2, that 2.
The same goes for this area now.
So I'm going to have A1, 2, and A2, 1.
Okay.
Now, let's look at, if I look at inversions now of my two permutations, this one has 0,
so this will be an even, so this will be positive, and this has a 1 inversion, because the 2 is
followed by a smaller 1, so this will be a negative.
So I'm looking at A1, 1 times A2, 2 minus A1, 2 times A2, 1.
What is that?
It's this one times that one, minus this one times that one, and what else is that?
Then the determinant, if I call this matrix A, this is the determinant of matrix A.
Isn't that fantastic?
I've used permutations.
I have used, looking at the inversion rate, then, inversion number of my permutations.
According to that, I've classified them as odd or even.
For the even ones, I've put a plus.
For the odd ones, I've put a negative.
And if I read it off now, I get the determinant of the matrix.
Let's look at this.
Here, I have three choices there.
Now, again, I cannot choose from the same row or the same column, and you'll very quickly
see that we are going to go to these six permutations.
It's a 3 by 3 matrix, or I have three elements to choose from.
So I have three elements to choose from, and it can only be a 1, 2, or a 3.
In these, I can only add a 1, 2, or a 3.
And because I cannot choose from the same row or column, so if I made that A1, 1, that's
1, I only have two choices there, a 2 and a 3.
If I choose a 2 there, I only have one choice, and that's a 3.
If I chose 3 for the second one, I only have one choice left there, that's 2.
And it's nothing other than permutations.
So I'm going to have 1, 2, 3.
Again, that's the same as before.
I'm going to have 1, 3, 2.
I'm going to have 2, 1, 3.
I'm going to have 2, 3, 1.
I'm going to have 3, 1, 2.
And I'm going to have 3, 2, 1.
And again, I can classify them.
1, 2, 3.
That is 0.
1, 3, 2.
That is 1 inversion.
That is 1 inversion.
2, 3.
That's 1 inversion.
That is 1, 2 inversions.
So this is going to be positive, negative, negative, negative, positive, negative.
And this is what it's going to be.
A, 1, 1.
A, 2, 2.
A, 3, 3.
Then I'm going to have a negative minus A, 1, 1.
A, 1, this empty space gets filled there.
This empty space gets filled there.
A, 2, 3.
A, 3, 2.
Minus.
I wonder what fell there.
Anyway, so that is how we're going to carry on.
Just using these signs and filling in the gaps with these.
And that will be my determinant.
As simple as that.
In the last video, I'll just show you an easy way
that you don't have to go through all of this to get to the determinant.
There's a similar use of this method really to get to the determinant.
But the beauty of it is, as I've shown you here,
indeed, it is that times A line, that times A.
It is exactly the same.
You're using permutations, inversions, and classifying
those permutations based on the inversion number.
Fantastic.
This last video, then, just an easy way to do it.
And I warn you, it only works for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.
It does not work for 4x4 and greater and greater.
So for 2x2, it's easy.
I'm going to draw an arrow in that direction
and an arrow in that direction.
And it is that minus that.
There's no problem.
For this one, it's a bit more complicated.
I've got to rewrite these two first columns.
So I'm going to write A11, A12.
I'm going to write A21 and A22.
And we're going to write A31 and A32.
And now I'm going to draw lines like this.
So this is that one, plus this one, plus that one, minus this one, minus this one, minus that.
Okay, so I've got to be able to complete diagonals.
So I can't have this one because that will go to an empty space.
I can't have this one that will go to an empty space.
So what I'm saying is, it's positive, this one times this one times this one, plus.
This one times this one times this one, plus.
This one times this one, plus this one, plus this one, times that one.
Minus, let me do that over again.
I don't know where I said positive plus and where I said multiply it says positive
this one times this one times this one plus this one times this one times this one plus
this one times this one times this one minus the product of 1, 2, 3 minus the product of
these three minus the product of these three and that gave us that will give you the whole
permutation.
So this is a short way of doing it but as I say be warned again only for 2 by 2 and 3
by 3 matrices and the 3 by 3 matrix you've got to add these first two columns.
