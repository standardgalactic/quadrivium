Certainly! Let's break down the operations and rules you've described with some examples.

### Rules for Inequalities

1. **Addition/Subtraction:**
   - If \(a > b\), then \(a + c > b + c\) (or \(a < b\) implies \(a + c < b + c\)) regardless of the sign of \(c\).
   - This means you can add or subtract the same number from both sides without changing the inequality.

2. **Multiplication/Division by a Positive Number:**
   - If \(a > b\) and \(c > 0\), then \(ac > bc\) (or \(a < b\) implies \(ac < bc\)).
   - Similarly, if you divide both sides of an inequality by the same positive number, the direction remains unchanged.

3. **Multiplication/Division by a Negative Number:**
   - If \(a > b\) and \(c < 0\), then \(ac < bc\) (or \(a < b\) implies \(ac > bc\)).
   - When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality reverses.

### Examples

1. **Addition/Subtraction:**
   - If \(4 > 3\), adding \(-2\) to both sides gives:
     \[
     4 + (-2) = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + (-2) = 1
     \]
     Thus, \(2 > 1\).

2. **Multiplication by a Positive Number:**
   - If \(5 < 7\) and you multiply both sides by \(3\):
     \[
     5 \times 3 = 15 \quad \text{and} \quad 7 \times 3 = 21
     \]
     So, \(15 < 21\).

3. **Multiplication by a Negative Number:**
   - If \(6 > 2\) and you multiply both sides by \(-4\):
     \[
     6 \times (-4) = -24 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 \times (-4) = -8
     \]
     The inequality reverses, so \(-24 < -8\).

4. **Division by a Positive Number:**
   - If \(10 > 5\) and you divide both sides by \(2\):
     \[
     \frac{10}{2} = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{5}{2} = 2.5
     \]
     Thus, \(5 > 2.5\).

5. **Division by a Negative Number:**
   - If \(8 > 4\) and you divide both sides by \(-2\):
     \[
     \frac{8}{-2} = -4 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4}{-2} = -2
     \]
     The inequality reverses, so \(-4 < -2\).

These rules and examples illustrate how operations affect inequalities. Remember, the key is to maintain the relationship between numbers while respecting the properties of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

To solve the inequality \(\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3} < 0\), we need to analyze when the expression results in a negative value. This occurs when either:

1. The numerator \(X^2 - 1\) is positive and the denominator \(X + 3\) is negative.
2. The numerator \(X^2 - 1\) is negative and the denominator \(X + 3\) is positive.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Factor the Numerator
The expression \(X^2 - 1\) can be factored as:
\[
X^2 - 1 = (X - 1)(X + 1)
\]
This gives us critical points at \(X = 1\) and \(X = -1\).

### Step 2: Analyze the Denominator
The denominator is \(X + 3\), which equals zero at \(X = -3\). This point cannot be included in our solution set because division by zero is undefined.

### Step 3: Determine Intervals
Using the critical points from both the numerator and the denominator, we divide the real number line into intervals:
- \((-\infty, -3)\)
- \((-3, -1)\)
- \((-1, 1)\)
- \((1, \infty)\)

### Step 4: Test Each Interval
We test a point from each interval to determine where the expression is negative.

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -3)\):** Choose \(X = -4\).
   - Numerator: \((-4 - 1)(-4 + 1) = (-5)(-3) = 15\) (positive)
   - Denominator: \(-4 + 3 = -1\) (negative)
   - Expression is positive.

2. **Interval \((-3, -1)\):** Choose \(X = -2\).
   - Numerator: \((-2 - 1)(-2 + 1) = (-3)(-1) = 3\) (positive)
   - Denominator: \(-2 + 3 = 1\) (positive)
   - Expression is positive.

3. **Interval \((-1, 1)\):** Choose \(X = 0\).
   - Numerator: \((0 - 1)(0 + 1) = (-1)(1) = -1\) (negative)
   - Denominator: \(0 + 3 = 3\) (positive)
   - Expression is negative.

4. **Interval \((1, \infty)\):** Choose \(X = 2\).
   - Numerator: \((2 - 1)(2 + 1) = (1)(3) = 3\) (positive)
   - Denominator: \(2 + 3 = 5\) (positive)
   - Expression is positive.

### Step 5: Combine Results
The expression \(\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3}\) is negative in the interval \((-1, 1)\).

### Step 6: Consider Critical Points
- At \(X = -3\), the expression is undefined.
- At \(X = -1\) and \(X = 1\), the numerator is zero, making the entire expression equal to zero.

Since we are looking for where the expression is strictly less than zero, we do not include \(-1\) or \(1\) in our solution set.

### Final Solution
The solution to the inequality \(\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3} < 0\) is:
\[
X \in (-1, 1)
\]

The text provides an explanation and examples of solving problems involving absolute values.

1. **Absolute Value Definition**: 
   - The absolute value of \( x \), denoted as \( |x| \), converts any number into a non-negative value:
     - If \( x \geq 0 \), then \( |x| = x \).
     - If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \).

2. **Example Problem**: 
   - Solve \( |x - 3| = 5 \):
     - Case 1: \( x - 3 = 5 \) (when \( x \geq 3 \)), leading to \( x = 8 \).
     - Case 2: \( -(x - 3) = 5 \) (when \( x < 3 \)), simplifying to \( x = -2 \).
   - Solutions are \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -2 \).

3. **Inequality Problem**:
   - Solve \( |x - 3| < 5 \):
     - Case 1: \( x - 3 < 5 \) (when \( x \geq 3 \)), resulting in \( x < 8 \). Thus, \( 3 \leq x < 8 \).
     - Case 2: \( -(x - 3) < 5 \) (when \( x < 3 \)), simplifying to \( x > -2 \). Thus, \( -2 < x < 3 \).
   - The solution is the union of intervals: \( (-2, 3) \cup [3, 8) \).

The text demonstrates how to handle equations and inequalities involving absolute values by considering different cases based on the definition of absolute value.

Four. When you perform the division:

- \( \frac{8}{-2} = -4 \)
- \( \frac{4}{-2} = -2 \)

Now, \(-4\) is less than \(-2\). This demonstrates that when dividing by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses.

Here's a summary of the rules for inequalities:

1. **Addition/Subtraction:**
   - If \( a < b \), then \( a + c < b + c \) (same holds if \( c \) is negative).
   - If \( a > b \), then \( a + c > b + c \).

2. **Multiplication by Positive Number:**
   - If \( a < b \) and \( c > 0 \), then \( ac < bc \).
   - If \( a > b \) and \( c > 0 \), then \( ac > bc \).

3. **Multiplication by Negative Number:**
   - If \( a < b \) and \( c < 0 \), then \( ac > bc \).
   - If \( a > b \) and \( c < 0 \), then \( ac < bc \).

4. **Division by Positive Number:**
   - If \( a < b \) and \( c > 0 \), then \( \frac{a}{c} < \frac{b}{c} \).
   - If \( a > b \) and \( c > 0 \), then \( \frac{a}{c} > \frac{b}{c} \).

5. **Division by Negative Number:**
   - If \( a < b \) and \( c < 0 \), then \( \frac{a}{c} > \frac{b}{c} \).
   - If \( a > b \) and \( c < 0 \), then \( \frac{a}{c} < \frac{b}{c} \).

These rules help maintain the correct relationship between inequalities when performing arithmetic operations.

Let's break down the problem you're working on and solve it step-by-step.

### Case 1: Equality

You start with the equation:

\[
\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3} = 0
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by \(X + 3\) (noting that \(X \neq -3\) to avoid division by zero):

\[
X^2 - 1 = 0
\]

Solve for \(X\):

\[
X^2 = 1
\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\[
X = \pm 1
\]

So, \(X = 1\) or \(X = -1\). These are solutions where the expression equals zero. Remember, \(X \neq -3\) because it would make the denominator zero.

### Case 2: Strict Inequality

Now consider:

\[
\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3} < 0
\]

For a fraction to be negative, either:
- The numerator is positive and the denominator is negative.
- The numerator is negative and the denominator is positive.

#### Sub-case 2.1: Numerator Negative, Denominator Positive

1. **Numerator**: \(X^2 - 1 < 0\)

   \[
   X^2 < 1
   \]

   This implies:

   \[
   -1 < X < 1
   \]

2. **Denominator**: \(X + 3 > 0\)

   \[
   X > -3
   \]

Combining these conditions, we get:

\[
-1 < X < 1
\]

#### Sub-case 2.2: Numerator Positive, Denominator Negative

1. **Numerator**: \(X^2 - 1 > 0\)

   \[
   X^2 > 1
   \]

   This implies:

   \[
   X < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad X > 1
   \]

2. **Denominator**: \(X + 3 < 0\)

   \[
   X < -3
   \]

Combining these conditions, we get:

\[
X < -3
\]

### Combining All Cases

- From Case 1: \(X = 1\) or \(X = -1\).
- From Sub-case 2.1: \(-1 < X < 1\).
- From Sub-case 2.2: \(X < -3\).

The solution to the inequality \(\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3} \leq 0\) is:

\[
X \in (-3, -1] \cup [1]
\]

This includes:
- The interval \((-3, -1]\) from Sub-case 2.1 and the equality at \(X = -1\).
- The point \(X = 1\) from Case 1.

Remember, \(X \neq -3\) because it would make the denominator zero.

The text discusses solving equations and inequalities involving absolute values using piecewise definitions.

1. **Basic Concept**: The absolute value of a number \( X \) is defined as:
   - \( |X| = X \) if \( X \geq 0 \)
   - \( |X| = -X \) if \( X < 0 \)

2. **Example Problems**:
   - For the equation \( |X - 3| = 5 \):
     - Case 1: \( X - 3 = 5 \) leads to \( X = 8 \)
     - Case 2: \( -(X - 3) = 5 \) simplifies to \( -X + 3 = 5 \), giving \( X = -2 \)
   - The solutions are \( X = 8 \) or \( X = -2 \).

3. **Inequality Example**: For the inequality \( |X - 3| < 5 \):
   - Case 1: \( X - 3 < 5 \) results in \( X < 8 \), with \( X \geq 0 \). So, \( 0 \leq X < 8 \).
   - Case 2: \( -(X - 3) < 5 \) simplifies to \( X > -2 \), with \( X < 0 \). Thus, \( -2 < X < 0 \).

4. **Solution**: The solution for the inequality is the union of intervals:
   - \( 0 \leq X < 8 \)
   - \( -2 < X < 0 \)

This approach allows solving absolute value equations and inequalities by considering both possible cases defined by the piecewise nature of absolute values.
