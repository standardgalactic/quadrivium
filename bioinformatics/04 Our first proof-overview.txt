The text outlines the process of constructing a mathematical proof by focusing on definitions. It emphasizes starting with agreed-upon definitions and using them as building blocks for proofs. The example given is proving the equality \( A_1 - A_2 = A_1 \cap A_2^c \). This involves demonstrating both directions of implication: 

1. Showing that \( A_1 - A_2 \subseteq A_1 \cap A_2^c \) by using the definition of set difference.
2. Proving \( A_1 \cap A_2^c \subseteq A_1 - A_2 \) by using the definitions of intersection and complement.

The text explains that proving equality involves showing both subsets, leading to the conclusion that the two sets are equal. It also introduces a method for defining set equality: if set \( f \) is a subset of set \( g \), and \( g \) is a subset of \( f \), then \( f = g \). The approach encourages filling a mental "box" with these foundational definitions to facilitate future proofs.

The text discusses the concept of using established definitions and previously known results in mathematical proofs. The key ideas include:

1. **Utilizing Definitions**: The process involves using accepted definitions (e.g., set operations) within a "box" of known information to construct new proofs.

2. **Proof Construction**: A specific example is given where an expression involving sets, \(a_1 - a_2\), is shown to be equivalent to \(a_1 \cap a_2^c\) (the intersection of set \(a_1\) with the complement of set \(a_2\)) by using definitions.

3. **Logical Flow**: The proof demonstrates that one set operation can be rewritten in terms of another, showing equivalence through logical steps and definitions.

4. **Building on Previous Work**: Once a new result is proven, it becomes part of the "box" of known information, which can be used to prove further results.

5. **Complexity Management**: As more proofs are added to the box, managing and remembering these results becomes challenging but crucial for constructing future proofs.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of definitions in mathematical reasoning and how they facilitate building complex arguments from simpler, previously established truths.
