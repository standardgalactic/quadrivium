In 1939, four German physicists, including Otto Frisch, discovered nuclear fission, marking the beginning of the nuclear age. This process involves an incident neutron being absorbed by uranium-235 (a form of enriched uranium), leading to the formation of a highly unstable uranium-236 compound nucleus. Due to the overpowering repulsive electric forces over the strong nuclear force, this nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, such as barium-141 and krypton-92 or xenon-140 and strontium-94, along with additional neutrons.

On average, one fission reaction produces about two and a half neutrons, facilitating further reactions. Each fission event releases approximately 200 mega electron volts (MeV) of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy from the daughter products. This energy release is vastly greater—up to 100 million times more—than that from chemical reactions like combustion.

In nuclear reactors or weapons, this process can lead to a chain reaction. When uranium-235 captures neutrons and undergoes fission, it releases additional neutrons that can induce further fissions in nearby nuclei. In a nuclear weapon, the material is highly enriched with uranium-235, leading to a rapid, uncontrolled chain reaction resulting in an explosive release of energy. Conversely, in a nuclear power plant, the reaction is controlled and slower, as not all nuclei undergo fission, allowing for a steady generation of energy.

The process relies on thermal neutrons—neutrons with very low kinetic energy (about 0.04 electron volts)—to be efficiently captured by uranium-235 or other fissile materials like plutonium-239. Unlike protons or alpha particles, which face electrostatic repulsion due to their positive charge, neutral neutrons can easily penetrate the nucleus for fission to occur.

Overall, nuclear fission has both destructive and beneficial applications: it powers nuclear weapons and provides a significant source of energy in nuclear power plants.

The text discusses how controlling neutron interactions can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, which is crucial for both nuclear power and weapons. In a fission process, neutrons cause further fissions in nearby nuclei. If an unfissionable material (such as graphite) is inserted between uranium nuclei, it slows down the neutrons, leading to a controlled energy release suitable for power generation.

The text explains that for a chain reaction to be sustained, each fission event must produce more than one neutron on average. A production of only one neutron per fission would not sustain a chain reaction because it wouldn't lead to an exponential increase in reactions.

Additionally, the text discusses binding energy and its relation to nuclear stability and energy release during fission. For a fission reaction to release energy, the resulting daughter nuclei must have higher binding energy per nucleon than the original nucleus. This corresponds to being on the downward side of the binding energy curve. If the products are on the upward side (lower binding energy), energy is required for the reaction, rather than released.

In summary, controlled neutron interactions allow for a sustained nuclear chain reaction in power plants, and energy release during fission depends on producing daughter nuclei with higher binding energy.
