In 1939, four German physicists, including Otto Frisch, discovered nuclear fission, marking the beginning of the nuclear age. This process involves an incident neutron being absorbed by uranium-235 (a form of enriched uranium), leading to the formation of a highly unstable uranium-236 compound nucleus. Due to the overpowering repulsive electric forces over the strong nuclear force, this nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, such as barium-141 and krypton-92 or xenon-140 and strontium-94, along with additional neutrons.

On average, one fission reaction produces about two and a half neutrons, facilitating further reactions. Each fission event releases approximately 200 mega electron volts (MeV) of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy from the daughter products. This energy release is vastly greater—up to 100 million times more—than that from chemical reactions like combustion.

In nuclear reactors or weapons, this process can lead to a chain reaction. When uranium-235 captures neutrons and undergoes fission, it releases additional neutrons that can induce further fissions in nearby nuclei. In a nuclear weapon, the material is highly enriched with uranium-235, leading to a rapid, uncontrolled chain reaction resulting in an explosive release of energy. Conversely, in a nuclear power plant, the reaction is controlled and slower, as not all nuclei undergo fission, allowing for a steady generation of energy.

The process relies on thermal neutrons—neutrons with very low kinetic energy (about 0.04 electron volts)—to be efficiently captured by uranium-235 or other fissile materials like plutonium-239. Unlike protons or alpha particles, which face electrostatic repulsion due to their positive charge, neutral neutrons can easily penetrate the nucleus for fission to occur.

Overall, nuclear fission has both destructive and beneficial applications: it powers nuclear weapons and provides a significant source of energy in nuclear power plants.

The text discusses how controlling neutron interactions can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, which is crucial for both nuclear power and weapons. In a fission process, neutrons cause further fissions in nearby nuclei. If an unfissionable material (such as graphite) is inserted between uranium nuclei, it slows down the neutrons, leading to a controlled energy release suitable for power generation.

The text explains that for a chain reaction to be sustained, each fission event must produce more than one neutron on average. A production of only one neutron per fission would not sustain a chain reaction because it wouldn't lead to an exponential increase in reactions.

Additionally, the text discusses binding energy and its relation to nuclear stability and energy release during fission. For a fission reaction to release energy, the resulting daughter nuclei must have higher binding energy per nucleon than the original nucleus. This corresponds to being on the downward side of the binding energy curve. If the products are on the upward side (lower binding energy), energy is required for the reaction, rather than released.

In summary, controlled neutron interactions allow for a sustained nuclear chain reaction in power plants, and energy release during fission depends on producing daughter nuclei with higher binding energy.

In 1939, four German physicists, including Otto Frisch, discovered nuclear fission, marking the beginning of the nuclear age. This discovery revealed that when an incident neutron is absorbed by uranium-235 (as opposed to uranium-238), it forms a compound nucleus (uranium-236) which splits into smaller nuclei and releases additional neutrons. Specifically, fission of uranium-235 can produce barium-141 plus krypton-92 with three neutrons or xenon-140 plus strontium-94 with two neutrons.

On average, nuclear fission of uranium-235 yields about 2.5 neutrons per reaction and releases approximately 200 mega electron volts (MeV) of energy, which is vastly more than chemical reactions like burning gasoline, coal, or petroleum. This energy originates from the conversion of stored electric potential energy in the nucleus to kinetic energy.

The binding energy per nucleon increases after fission due to a mass defect that converts into energy, explaining why such an enormous amount of energy is released during nuclear fission. Uranium-235 makes up about 0.725% of all uranium on Earth and is more likely than uranium-238 to capture thermal neutrons (with kinetic energies around 0.04 eV) and undergo fission.

For practical applications like nuclear reactors, thermal neutrons are preferred because they can easily penetrate the nucleus without facing electrostatic repulsion, unlike charged particles such as protons or alpha particles.

In nuclear weapons, highly enriched uranium-235 undergoes rapid fission in a chain reaction, resulting in an instantaneous and massive release of energy. Conversely, nuclear power plants operate with a slower chain reaction, using materials mixed with less fissile material to control the rate of fission, allowing for sustained and controlled energy production over time.

The text discusses how nuclear fission reactions can be controlled and sustained, focusing on neutron behavior in these processes. Here's a summary:

1. **Neutron Interaction**: A free neutron does not necessarily cause fission of a nucleus. Introducing unfissionable material between uranium nuclei slows down the reaction by reducing neutron interactions, which leads to a more controlled release of energy suitable for power plants.

2. **Sustainability of Chain Reactions**: For a chain reaction to be sustained in nuclear fission, each fission event must produce an average of at least two neutrons. If only one neutron is produced per fission, the reaction cannot sustain itself because it does not lead to a rapid increase in reactions needed for a chain reaction.

3. **Energy Release and Binding Energy**: Fission releases energy when the daughter nuclei have higher binding energies than the original nucleus. This occurs on the downward slope of the graph plotting atomic mass number against binding energy per nucleon, where uranium splits into products with higher binding energy. If the resulting nuclei are on the upward slope, they would have lower binding energy, requiring energy input rather than releasing it.

This explanation highlights how nuclear reactions must be managed to harness energy effectively and sustain a chain reaction by ensuring sufficient neutron production and optimal binding energy conditions for fission.
