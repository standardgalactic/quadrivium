The presentation provides an overview of obstructive jaundice, emphasizing its importance for medical exams and clinical practice. Obstructive jaundice occurs due to a blockage in bile flow into the duodenum, leading to jaundice symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and pale stools.

Key causes include:

1. **Choledocolithiasis**: Stones blocking the bile ducts, often presenting with cholangitis.
2. **Biliary Tract Tumors**: Such as cholangiocarcinomas.
3. **Extrinsic Compression**: From lymphoma or other nodal diseases compressing the bile duct.
4. **Parasitic Infections**: Primarily Ascaris causing obstruction.
5. **HIV Cholangiopathy**: From HIV, cytomegalovirus, or cryptosporidium.
6. **Lymphomas**: Occasionally presenting with obstructive jaundice due to extrinsic bile duct compression.
7. **Choledochal Cysts and Pancreatitis**: Both acute and chronic pancreatitis can cause obstruction.
8. **Mirizzi Syndrome**: Cholecystitis causing a stone in Hartman's pouch, leading to bile duct compression.
9. **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis**.

Other causes seen in critical care include severe sepsis, hyperperfusion, perineoplastic syndromes (often renal cell carcinoma), and complications from total parenteral nutrition.

Diagnosis involves confirming obstructive jaundice through laboratory tests, showing elevated liver enzymes with a predominance of conjugated bilirubin, increased ALP (alkaline phosphatase) and gamma GT (gamma-glutamyl transferase). Imaging studies like ultrasound, CT scans, MRCP, or ERCP are used to identify the obstruction source.

Management includes ensuring proper hydration, administering antibiotics for infections such as cholangitis, and protecting kidney function. Referral to specialized units for advanced management is recommended. The presentation concludes by encouraging trainees to research local cause prevalence further.

The text provides an overview of obstructive jaundice, which occurs due to a blockage preventing bile from flowing into the duodenum. It is important for medical professionals as it may be encountered during exams or clinical practice.

**Causes:**
- **Choledochal Arthritis:** Most common cause, often presenting with cholangitis.
- **Biliary Tract Tumors (e.g., Cholangiocarcinomas).**
- **Extrinsic Compression:** Due to lymphoma or other nodal diseases.
- **Parasitic Infections:** Such as Ascaris.
- **HIV Cholangiopathy.**
- **Lymphomas and Choledochal Cysts:** Can also cause obstruction.
- **Pancreatitis:** Both acute and chronic forms.
- **Mirizzi Syndrome:** Due to gallstones compressing the bile duct.
- **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis:** A less common but important consideration.

**Clinical Presentation:**
Patients typically present with jaundice, yellowing of the skin and sclera. They may also exhibit pale stools due to lack of stercobilinogen in the intestines and dark urine from excess bilirubin.

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Elevated liver enzymes, particularly conjugated bilirubin.
- Increased levels of ALKP and gamma GT disproportionate to AST and ALT.

**Management Approach:**
1. **Confirm Diagnosis:** Start with laboratory tests and imaging like ultrasound, CT scan, MRCP, or ERCP.
2. **Initial Management:** Refer patients for specialized care; ensure hydration via IV fluids.
3. **Treatment for Cholangitis:** Administer antibiotics and fluids, and obtain blood cultures.

The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing obstructive jaundice symptoms and using appropriate diagnostic tools to identify its cause, ensuring timely and effective treatment.
