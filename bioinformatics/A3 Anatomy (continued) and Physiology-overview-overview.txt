The text discusses both the anatomy and physiology of the appendix. Anatomically, it is located at the base of the cecum where the taenia coli converge, with a diameter of about 6 mm and varying length from 2 to over 20 cm. The position of its tip can affect clinical symptoms during appendicitis due to nerve supply changesâ€”from visceral nerves around the T10 level to somatic nerves as inflammation progresses.

The appendix is supplied by the appendiceal artery, an end artery branching from the ileocolic artery. If this artery becomes occluded because of inflammation or infection, it can lead to necrosis and perforation unless accessory arteries provide alternate blood flow. Venous drainage occurs through the portal system into the liver, historically resulting in conditions like portal sepsis or liver abscesses before antibiotics were available. Lymphatic vessels follow the arterial supply and may spread systemic infections or facilitate cancer metastasis, with lymph nodes potentially mimicking appendicitis symptoms during infections.

Physiologically, the appendix contains T and B lymphocytes within its mucosa and submucosa, contributing to gut-associated lymphoid tissue. It plays a role in immune response by presenting antigens to these cells, aiding in antibody production or infection defense in the distal gut.
