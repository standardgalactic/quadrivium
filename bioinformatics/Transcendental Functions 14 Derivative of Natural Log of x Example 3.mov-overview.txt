The text discusses how to find derivatives for various functions involving natural logarithms and powers of \(x\). It covers the following:

1. **Derivative using Product Rule**:
   - Function: \( y = \frac{x^4}{4} \ln(x) - \frac{x^4}{16} \).
   - The derivative is evaluated by applying the product rule to \(\frac{x^4}{4} \ln(x)\), resulting in a simplified expression of \( x^3 \ln(x) \).

2. **Derivative using Quotient Rule**:
   - Function: \( y = \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \).
   - The quotient rule is used to derive the function, leading to \( y' = \frac{1 - \ln(x)}{x^2} \).

3. **Chain Rule Application**:
   - Function: \( y = \ln(\ln(x)) \).
   - Applying the chain rule gives the derivative as \( y' = \frac{1}{x \ln(x)} \).

4. **Additional Quotient Rule Example**:
   - Function: \( y = \frac{\ln(x)}{1 + \ln(x)} \).
   - Using the quotient rule results in \( y' = \frac{1}{x(1+\ln(x))^2} \).

The text provides step-by-step processes for applying calculus rules (product, quotient, and chain) to find derivatives of these functions.
