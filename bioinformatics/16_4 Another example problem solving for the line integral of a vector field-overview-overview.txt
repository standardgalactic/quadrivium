The text outlines a method to calculate the work done by a force field on a particle moving from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) along a straight line. The force field is given by the vector function \((xy, y, -yz)\). To find the work done, one sets up and evaluates a line integral \(\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}\), where \(\mathbf{F}\) is the force vector and \(d\mathbf{r}\) is the differential displacement vector.

The path of the particle is parametrized by \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t, t)\) for \(t\) ranging from 0 to 1. The derivative of this parametrization is \(\mathbf{r}'(t) = (1, 1, 1)\).

Substituting the path into the force field gives the vector \((t^2, t, -t^2)\). The work done by the force field is then calculated by evaluating:

\[
\int_0^1 (t^2, t, -t^2) \cdot (1, 1, 1) \, dt = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t - t^2) \, dt = \int_0^1 t \, dt
\]

This integral simplifies to:

\[
\left[ \frac{1}{2}t^2 \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the work done by the force field along the path is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
