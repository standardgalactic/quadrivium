The text explores electric potential energy in capacitors and its expression as energy density. It starts with deriving an equation for electric potential energy \( U \) stored in a capacitor: 

\[ U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 \]

where \( C \) is the capacitance and \( V \) is the voltage across the capacitor. The text also describes how this can be expressed as energy density (\( u \)), which is electric potential energy per unit volume:

\[ u = \frac{U}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{\epsilon_0 E^2}{2} \]

where \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space and \( E \) is the electric field.

The text then applies these concepts to an isolated spherical capacitor with a given radius and charge, using:

\[ C = 4\pi\epsilon_0 R \]

to find the energy stored. It calculates the potential energy as approximately 103 nanojoules for a sphere of radius 0.0685 meters charged with 1.25 nanocoulombs.

Finally, it discusses solving problems involving capacitors in series and parallel configurations within an electrical circuit. The equivalent capacitance of capacitors in parallel is the sum of their individual capacitances, while those in series follow:

\[ \frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \cdots \]

The text provides a step-by-step approach to finding the charge on a specific capacitor when given their capacitances and the circuit's potential difference.

The text appears to describe a problem involving capacitors and their properties within an electrical circuit. Here is a summary of the key points:

1. **Capacitance Calculation**: The text mentions calculating an equivalent capacitance (C123) as \(7.5 \times 10^{-6}\).

2. **Charge Conservation**: It discusses the principle that charge (Q) remains constant in certain configurations, specifically for the whole circuit.

3. **Values and Constants**:
   - Charge (\(Q\)) is given as \(7.5 \times 10^{-4}\) coulombs.
   - The voltage across a component (\(V_3\)) is calculated using \(Q = CV\), leading to \(V_3 = 50\) volts.

4. **Capacitance Relationships**: It mentions that capacitors C12 and C3 are theoretically equivalent, implying they have the same capacitance value.

5. **Voltage Calculation**:
   - Voltage across a component (\(V_3\)) is calculated using \(Q/C_3\), resulting in \(50\) volts given \(C_3 = 15 \times 10^{-6}\).

6. **Energy Stored**: The electric potential energy (U) stored in the capacitor is calculated using \(U = Q^2 / 2C\), which results in approximately \(18.8\) millijoules.

7. **Key Concepts**:
   - The text emphasizes understanding which components are in series or parallel.
   - It highlights that charge (\(Q\)) remains constant when capacitors are in series, whereas voltage may vary.
