The text explores electric potential energy in capacitors and its expression as energy density. It starts with deriving an equation for electric potential energy \( U \) stored in a capacitor: 

\[ U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 \]

where \( C \) is the capacitance and \( V \) is the voltage across the capacitor. The text also describes how this can be expressed as energy density (\( u \)), which is electric potential energy per unit volume:

\[ u = \frac{U}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{\epsilon_0 E^2}{2} \]

where \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space and \( E \) is the electric field.

The text then applies these concepts to an isolated spherical capacitor with a given radius and charge, using:

\[ C = 4\pi\epsilon_0 R \]

to find the energy stored. It calculates the potential energy as approximately 103 nanojoules for a sphere of radius 0.0685 meters charged with 1.25 nanocoulombs.

Finally, it discusses solving problems involving capacitors in series and parallel configurations within an electrical circuit. The equivalent capacitance of capacitors in parallel is the sum of their individual capacitances, while those in series follow:

\[ \frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \cdots \]

The text provides a step-by-step approach to finding the charge on a specific capacitor when given their capacitances and the circuit's potential difference.

The text appears to describe a problem involving capacitors and their properties within an electrical circuit. Here is a summary of the key points:

1. **Capacitance Calculation**: The text mentions calculating an equivalent capacitance (C123) as \(7.5 \times 10^{-6}\).

2. **Charge Conservation**: It discusses the principle that charge (Q) remains constant in certain configurations, specifically for the whole circuit.

3. **Values and Constants**:
   - Charge (\(Q\)) is given as \(7.5 \times 10^{-4}\) coulombs.
   - The voltage across a component (\(V_3\)) is calculated using \(Q = CV\), leading to \(V_3 = 50\) volts.

4. **Capacitance Relationships**: It mentions that capacitors C12 and C3 are theoretically equivalent, implying they have the same capacitance value.

5. **Voltage Calculation**:
   - Voltage across a component (\(V_3\)) is calculated using \(Q/C_3\), resulting in \(50\) volts given \(C_3 = 15 \times 10^{-6}\).

6. **Energy Stored**: The electric potential energy (U) stored in the capacitor is calculated using \(U = Q^2 / 2C\), which results in approximately \(18.8\) millijoules.

7. **Key Concepts**:
   - The text emphasizes understanding which components are in series or parallel.
   - It highlights that charge (\(Q\)) remains constant when capacitors are in series, whereas voltage may vary.

The text suggests a continuation of the explanation in another session, indicating it's part of a broader instructional video or lecture.

The text discusses electric potential energy in capacitors and its related concepts. It begins with the derivation of two formulas for the electric potential energy \( U \) stored in a capacitor: 

1. \( U = \frac{Q^2}{2C} \)
2. \( U = \frac{1}{2} CV^2 \)

These equations show how energy is related to charge (\( Q \)), capacitance (\( C \)), and voltage (\( V \)).

The text then transitions to discussing the concept of electric potential energy density, which involves dividing the potential energy by volume. This leads to a formula involving permittivity of free space (\( \varepsilon_0 \)) and the electric field (\( E \)): 

\[ u = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 E^2 \]

The text uses this framework to solve an example involving a charged isolated conducting sphere. Given its radius and charge, it calculates the electric potential energy using \( U = \frac{Q^2}{8\pi\varepsilon_0 R} \).

Additionally, the text addresses calculating the electric field around such a sphere, leading to:

\[ E = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{Q}{R^2} \]

Finally, the discussion moves to an electrical circuit problem involving three capacitors. Capacitors 1 and 2 are in parallel, which means their capacitances add up (\( C_{12} = C_1 + C_2 \)), while this combined capacitor is then in series with capacitor 3. The text explains how to find the equivalent capacitance for such configurations using:

\[ \frac{1}{C_{123}} = \frac{1}{C_{12}} + \frac{1}{C_3} \]

The example provided involves calculating charges and potential differences using these principles, with numerical values given in microfarads.

The text describes a process involving capacitors and their properties in an electrical circuit. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Capacitance Calculations:**
   - The inverse of some value is represented as \( C_{123} \).
   - A constant charge \( Q \) for the entire circuit is defined, where \( Q = C_v \).

2. **Charge and Capacitance Values:**
   - The capacitance \( C \) is given as \( C_{123} \), with a charge \( Q = 123 \) and voltage \( V = 100 \).
   - Charge \( Q \) is calculated to be \( 7.5 \times 10^{-4} \) coulombs.
   - Capacitance values for combinations of capacitors (\( C_{12} \) and \( C_3 \)) are theoretically equal.

3. **Voltage Calculation:**
   - The voltage across capacitor \( C_3 \), denoted as \( V_3 \), is calculated using the formula \( V = \frac{Q}{C} \).
   - Given \( Q_3 = 7.5 \times 10^{-4} \) coulombs and \( C_3 = 15 \times 10^{-6} \), the voltage \( V_3 \) is found to be 50.0 volts.

4. **Energy Stored in Capacitor:**
   - The energy stored (\( U_3 \)) is calculated using \( U = \frac{Q^2}{2C} \).
   - With \( Q = 7.5 \times 10^{-4} \) coulombs and \( C_3 = 15 \times 10^{-6} \), the energy \( U_3 \) is determined to be 18.8 millijoules.

The text emphasizes keeping track of which capacitors are in series or parallel and whether charge (\( Q \)) or voltage (\( V \)) remains constant in different configurations. It also suggests further exploration of these concepts in future discussions.
