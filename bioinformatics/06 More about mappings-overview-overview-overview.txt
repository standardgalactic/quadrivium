The text provides an overview of key concepts in mathematical mappings, specifically focusing on distinctions between domain, co-domain, and range, as well as exploring specific types of mappings such as onto mappings, bijections, and inverse mappings:

1. **Domain and Co-Domain**: The domain is the set of all possible inputs for a mapping process, while the co-domain is the set where outputs could potentially lie. For example, when natural numbers are mapped to \(n+2\), the co-domain includes all natural numbers, but not every number in the co-domain is an actual output.

2. **Range**: The range (or image) comprises the actual outputs that result from applying a mapping to elements of the domain. In this case, it includes all natural numbers except 1 and 2.

3. **Onto Mapping**: A function is called onto (surjective) if every element in the co-domain has at least one pre-image in the domain. This means there are no "missed" outputs within the co-domain.

4. **Bijection**: A bijection is a mapping that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Every element of the co-domain corresponds uniquely to an element in the domain, establishing a perfect pairing between them.

5. **Inverse Mapping**: Only bijective functions have inverses, allowing for a unique reverse mapping from the co-domain back to the domain. This ensures that every output can be traced back to a single input.

6. **Composition of Mappings**: When mappings are combined (e.g., \(\alpha\) followed by \(\beta\)), their composition (\(\beta\alpha\) or \(\alpha\beta\)) depends on the order in which they are applied, affecting the final result.

The text concludes with a reference to a theorem stating that bijective functions have unique inverses, setting up further exploration of these concepts.
