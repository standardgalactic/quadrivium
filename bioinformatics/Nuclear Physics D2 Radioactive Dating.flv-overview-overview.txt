The text provides an explanation of radioactive decay and its application in carbon-14 dating to determine the age of formerly living objects. Here's a summary:

1. **Radioactive Decay Basics**:
   - Radioactive decay is the process by which unstable atomic nuclei transform into stable ones over time, characterized by a half-life (\(t_{1/2}\)), the time it takes for half of the radioactive sample to decay.

2. **Carbon-14 Dating**:
   - Carbon-14 dating measures the age of objects that were once alive based on remaining carbon-14 levels.
   - Living organisms maintain constant carbon-14 due to atmospheric absorption; upon death, intake stops and decay begins at a known rate.

3. **Decay Constant (\(\lambda\))**:
   - The decay constant is calculated using: \(\lambda = \frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}\).

4. **Activity and Calculation**:
   - Activity refers to the number of decays per unit time.
   - A sample's current activity (\(A\)) compared to its original activity (\(A_0\)) when alive is used to determine age: \(t = \frac{\ln(A_0/A)}{\lambda}\).

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - For a specimen with 9.2 grams of carbon and an activity of 1.6 disintegrations per second, the baseline living activity would be \(A_0 = 9.2 \times 0.23 = 2.116\) disintegrations/second.
   - The age is calculated as: 
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(2.116 / 1.6)}{5.7 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{s}^{-1}}
     \]
   - Converting to years gives an approximate age of 2300 years.

This method uses the decay of carbon-14 to estimate the age of archaeological samples by comparing current activity to historical baselines.
