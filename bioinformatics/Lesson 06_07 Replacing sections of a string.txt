let's have a look at this finding and replacing characters and sub strings inside of strings now
remember the variable we had before str underscore r let's just have a look at what it was again it
says this is a this is going to be a fairly extended sentence now let's look at this in
function it's going to look for specific characters it can look for specific characters inside of a
string so in takes the following arguments what you're looking for and you see the single quotation
marks i'm looking for character and inside of this computer variable str underscore r which is the
string this is going to be a fairly long sentence and it just returns true it could find an if
inside of that string so in helps just for boolean returns but let's use this contains function now
for contains we're going to look for strings now just just watch out the order of these arguments
are the other way around now so it contains the string that i'm looking for and the string inside
of that string i'm looking for so i'm asking is fairly inside of that string of mine and indeed
it's true it's right there now let's look at the search function so there's quite a few of these and
and don't get confused between them keep these notes handy so note the if is in double quotation
marks here so search which is the same order of these arguments as the contains so the string i'm
looking for and if which is now double quotation marks so there we go it says it found an if it found
only one in position 25 so remember the index of a string in position 25 now let's do the following
instead of just looking for an if i am now doing a search but i'm doing it on this array of
characters it's characters because i'm using single quotation marks let's see what happens there
it just returns one value now this is going to be a fairly long sentence uh where do i have it this is
going to be a fairly long or fairly extended sentence so certainly there are g's in there there's an i in
there there's an f in there but it just looks down that array and it looks for the first thing that
it can find and in position three there was an i for this in this there we go an i there this is the
first thing it finds out of that array it's going to return to us let's just do this search again just
on this uh string and now we're going to put a whole string inside of it and it says yes it found
fairly and it took the index from 25 to 30. a bit of regular expressions using search and i said we're
going to get to that i'll explain to you what this is all about it says this is a regular expression
anything that has it starts with an f and this dot here is just uh for anything that follows it's like
kind of like a wild card and that means right to the end so the first effort found was a 25 and then
everything after that was included i'll get to exactly what all of this means you needn't have put
that but it will get to all of that now replacing substrings or characters using the replace function
so i can say replace inside of my string the word fairly because we know now it's there with the word
very let's see what that is this is going to be a very extended sentence
i can also replace it with an uppercase so there's i'm going to take the string i'm going to replace
fairly with its uppercase equivalent so this is going to be a fairly extended sentence now note what
happens now if i were just to call the string again even though i've changed it it's still the same
it is still the same the very which we replaced it with and then the fairly which is capital is gone
because strings are what we call immutable they cannot be changed after we've created them
so there's no replace with this bang this exclamation mark so that certainly does not exist
so you'll have to create a new version of that string a new copy of that string
if you've changed it next up and that is the last section in this lesson in the very exciting world
of regular expressions
you
