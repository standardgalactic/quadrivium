Now looking at this problem we'll notice first of all linear first linear second
order ordinary differential equation I still have constant coefficients but
that at the moment I have a sub 2 of x equals 4x to the power 0 in effect but
I'll also notice that the g of x on this side that the g of x equals 1 over the
sine of 3x and to get the annihilated differential operator of that might be a
bit difficult we saw in the previous videos that we can't do that using that
technique so we're going to use the variation of parameters but first of all
we need the leading coefficient of the highest differential operator on this
side to be a 1 so I'm going to have y prime prime plus 9y equals 1 over 4
sine 3x I've divided throughout each term by 4 now first of all as always I need
the I need the complementary set of solutions I'm going to change this now I
now have an f of x and f of x now equals 1 over 4 sine of 3x that is now my f of x
and I might as well mark it where are my markers seem to only have yellow around so
that is certainly one thing that I do need for this approach so I'm going to use the
auxiliary equation by setting f of x equal to 0 making this a homogeneous
equation so I'm going to have m squared plus 9 it seems equals 0 because I can
rewrite this as d squared plus 9 times y it's going to be second derivative of y plus 9y and that's
exactly that so this so I have the fact that m squared is going to be equal to
negative 3 squared in other words I'm going to have m sub 1 equals 0 plus we're going to have 0 plus 3i and m sub 2 is going to be 0 minus 3i
because that is going to be the square root m is going to be the square root of this
3 squared I can bring out as a 3 so it's 3 times the square root and write it like that it is 3 times the square root of negative 1
that is 3 times i but I have plus or minus plus or minus sign there this is just to remind me that alpha now equals 0 and my beta equals 3
so remember I write this as e to the power alpha x plus times c sub 1 cosine of beta x plus c sub 2 of sine of x
remember that so I'm going to have y sub c equals that's a 0 so that falls away c sub 1 cosine of 3x plus c sub 2 sine of 3x
in other words I have a few more things here now I have a few more things here now I have my y sub 1
if you can see there y sub 1 is there it's cosine of 3x and I have my y sub 2 which is the sine of 3x
I can immediately get my Ronskian by writing this cosine of 3x sine of 3x and the derivative of this would be negative 3 times the sine of 3x
chain rule and here we can have 3 times the cosine of 3x as far as my matrix is concerned my Ronskian is going to be the determinant of this which is this minus that
so I'm going to have 3 times the cosine squared of 3x minus negative 3 so it means positive 3 sine squared of 3x
I can take 3 out as a common factor and I'm going to be left with a cosine squared of 3x plus the sine squared of 3x
and we know our trigonometric identities no matter that there's a 3 3x might as well equal p so it's cosine or theta
theta equals 3x so it's cosine squared of theta plus sine squared of theta that's just 1 so my Ronskian equals 3
I also know that my y sub p I'm going to write as u sub 1 plus u sub 2 y sub 2 we know that
and we know that u sub 1 is going to be negative the integral of
I've got to remember that y sub 2 times the f of x divided by the Ronskian
d of x hope you can still see there yeah so u sub 1 is going to be negative the integral of what is y sub 2
let's just mark all of these so I have y sub 1 y sub 2 the Ronskian and I have my f of x up there
so y sub 2 is the sine of 3x and y sub 2 and we're going to multiply that by the f of x
well the f of x is
1 over 4 sine 3x and I've got to divide this by the Ronskian which is another 3 dx
so there was my f of x there's my y sub 1 of x y sub 2 of x and here's my Ronskian and I've substituted
it in here that is what I get so my u sub 1
u sub 1 is going to be I can bring this negative 1 over 12 out as all as constants
and sine over 3x and sine over 3x cancel out so it's just the integral of dx that is going to be
negative 1 over 12 x I'm not going to put the plus c because the c appear the constants appear
in the final solution y sub 2 I remind you is the integral of y sub 1 times the f of x divided by
the Ronskian of dx so this one's going to be a tad more complicated let's just mark these in green
because these are the ones that I should be able to wake you up in the middle of the night and
those would be the first words that come out of your mouth now u sub 2 in other words equals
an integral what was y sub 1 well that's the cosine of 3x what is the f of x well the f of x is
4 1 over 4 times the sine of 3x multiplied or divided by the Ronskian which is another 3 dx so if I just
rewrite that neatly that's going to be 12 that I've been out cosine of 3x divided by the sine of 3x
dx and we know that this is going to end up being a logarithm now you can do this all in one step but
in case you can't remember first the first level calculus let's just use use substitution but I'm
already using you so let's just use for argument say this is p so let's say p equals the sine of 3x
in other words dp dx is going to be what it's going to be 3 times the cosine of x and if I just neaten
things up I note that the cosine oops of 3x the cosine of 3x dx what am I doing
x is going to be a third dp so now that I've gotten all of that I hope you can see there at the bottom
so if p equals the sine of x I see that would be a very neat thing to do because if I take the first
derivative I get three times the cosine of 3x and if I just do some algebra on that I note that the cosine
of 3x dx equals a third dp and I have the cosine of 3x dx there which I can now just replace with a
third dp so let's do that so u sub 2 is going to equal the integral well 1 over 12 first of all
times the integral now the cosine of 3x dx is just a third so I'll bring that third out
so this is going to be dp divided by but remember the sine of 3x is just p
so u sub 2 is going to be 1 over 36 times the natural log of the absolute value of p
so that's 1 over 36 times the natural log of the absolute value of the sine of 3x remember that was that
so y sub p is going to be u sub 1 we've got u sub 1 there it's negative 1 over 12x times y sub 1 which
was the cosine of 3x remember plus u sub 2 which is 1 over 36 times the natural log of the absolute value
of sine of 3x times y sub 2 which was the sine of 3x so if I get this all together I'm going to get c sub 1
cosine of 3x plus c sub 2 sine of 3x that was my complementary solution and then now negative a
negative 1 over 12x cosine of 3x plus 1 over 36 sine of 3x natural log of absolute value of sine of 3x and
that's beautiful oh can you see all of that come out there in the corner so I've just let the fact
remember the fact here that's y sub c plus y sub p and I know that y sub p equals u sub 1 y sub 1 plus
u sub 2 y sub 2 which I have just which I have just done I hope this whole video comes out I think
everything is a bit the recording is a bit stew so that that one I have to remember and I've just put them all
I've just put all the answers that I've just gotten mu sub 1 I've just done y sub 1 comes from
y sub c y sub 2 comes from y sub c youtube we've just done and there is my complementary
and here is my particular solution all put together because remember y equals y sub c plus y sub p
