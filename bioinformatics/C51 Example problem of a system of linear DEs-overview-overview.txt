The text outlines a method for solving a system of linear differential equations using an example involving saltwater entering and exiting a tank. Here's a concise summary:

### Steps Involved:

1. **Notation:**
   - Variables \( x \) and \( y \) are replaced with \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).

2. **Differential Formulation:**
   - Two differential equations:
     1. \(\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \frac{2}{25}x_1 - \frac{1}{50}x_2 = 0\)
     2. \(\frac{d}{dt}x_2 + \frac{2}{25}x_2 - \frac{2}{25}x_1 = 0\)

3. **Solving for a Variable:**
   - Solve the second equation for \( x_2 \):
     - \( x_2 = \frac{2}{25}\left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_1 \)

4. **Substitution:**
   - Substitute \( x_2 \) into the first equation:
     - \(\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \frac{2}{25}x_1 - \frac{1}{50}\left(\frac{2}{25}\left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_1\right) = 0\)

5. **Simplification:**
   - Simplify to form a second-order differential equation:
     - \(\frac{d^2}{dt^2}x_1 + \frac{4}{25}\frac{d}{dt}x_1 = 0\)

6. **Characteristic Equation:**
   - Solve the characteristic equation \( m^2 + \frac{4}{25}m = 0 \) to find roots:
     - \( m_1 = 0 \), \( m_2 = -\frac{4}{25} \)

7. **General Solution for \( x_1(t) \):**
   - General solution: 
     - \( x_1(t) = c_1 + c_2 e^{-4t/25} \)

8. **Solution for \( x_2(t) \):**
   - Substitute back to find:
     - \( x_2(t) = 50c_2\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)e^{-4t/25} = -12.5c_2 e^{-4t/25} \)

9. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Given initial conditions are used to solve for constants:
     - \( x_1(0) = 25 \), \( x_2(0) = 0 \)
     - Resulting equations:
       - \( c_1 + c_2 = 25 \)
       - \( -12.5c_2 = 0 \)

10. **Solving for Constants:**
    - From the conditions, solve to find:
      - \( c_1 = 25 \), \( c_2 = 0 \)

11. **Final Solution:**
    - Substitute constants back into solutions:
      - \( x_1(t) = 25 \)
      - \( x_2(t) = 0 \)

This solution process effectively demonstrates solving a system of linear differential equations using substitution, simplification, and initial conditions to determine the specific solution.

The text provides solutions for two functions:

- \( x_1(t) = \frac{25}{2} e^{-t/25} + \frac{25}{2} e^{-3t/25} \)
- \( x_2(t) = 25 e^{-t/25} - 25 e^{-3t/25} \)

It highlights the complexity and effort required to derive these solutions, noting that it took several pages of work. The author stresses the importance of persistence in following known steps repeatedly until reaching a solution.
