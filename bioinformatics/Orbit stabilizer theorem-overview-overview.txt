The text provides an overview of the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem in group theory. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Key Definitions**:
   - **Index**: The number of distinct left cosets of a stabilizer subgroup \( A \) in a group \( G \), denoted as \( |G : A| \).
   - **Orbit**: The set of elements reached by applying group actions to an element \( A \).

2. **Theorem**:
   - States that the index of the stabilizer subgroup \( A \) in \( G \) is equal to the number of elements in the orbit of \( A \). Formally, \( |G : A| = |\text{Orbit}(A)| \).

3. **Explanation**:
   - Elements from a coset map identically within an orbit.
   - Mapping different cosets to the same orbit element contradicts their distinct nature.

4. **Proof Outline**:
   - Acting with any element of a coset on \( A \) yields the same result, maintaining coset integrity.
   - Different cosets mapping to the same orbit element is impossible under group action rules.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Highlights the relationship between subgroup indices and group actions, showing how they count equivalently in terms of orbits and cosets.

The text underscores the importance of understanding this theorem for its implications in group theory.
