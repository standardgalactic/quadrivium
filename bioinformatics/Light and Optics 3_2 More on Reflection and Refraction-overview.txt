The text discusses how light behaves when it interacts with surfaces, specifically focusing on polarization effects during reflection and refraction. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Polarization of Reflected Light**: When unpolarized light hits a surface at a certain angle (Brewster's Angle), the reflected light becomes polarized. This means that the oscillations of the electric field in the light waves are aligned perpendicularly to the plane of incidence.

2. **Incident and Refracted Components**: Unpolarized incident light can be resolved into two components: one parallel (in-plane) and one perpendicular (out-of-plane) to the plane of incidence. These components behave differently upon reflection and refraction.

3. **Brewster's Law**: Named after Sir David Brewster, this law states that when the angle of incidence is such that the reflected and refracted rays are at 90 degrees to each other, the reflected light is completely polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence. This specific angle of incidence is known as Brewster’s Angle.

4. **Application in Sunglasses**: Polarized sunglasses exploit this principle by using vertical polarization filters to reduce glare from horizontal reflections, such as those off water surfaces.

5. **Mathematical Formulation**: Using Snell's Law and the conditions for Brewster's angle, an equation is derived where Brewster’s Angle (\(\theta_B\)) can be calculated using the refractive indices of the two media (NT/NI) involved: \(\tan(\theta_B) = \frac{NT}{NI}\).

6. **Critical Angle Example**: The text concludes with a practical problem involving observing an object at the critical angle in a liquid tank, illustrating how Snell’s Law can be used to determine angles and distances based on refractive indices.

This explanation highlights how polarization arises from reflection under specific conditions and its applications, providing both theoretical insights and practical examples.

The text discusses determining the critical angle for light passing from a liquid into air, where the absolute refractive index of air (Nt) is 1. The person outlines two methods to find this angle and the liquid's refractive index (Ni).

1. **Direct Calculation**:
   - Given that the sine of the critical angle is Nt/Ni, they calculate Ni as 1 divided by the sine of the critical angle.
   - With a critical angle of approximately 52.31 degrees, the sine value is about 0.77.
   - Therefore, \( Ni = \frac{1}{0.77} \approx 1.26 \).

2. **Using Snell's Law**:
   - Alternatively, they could use Snell’s law where the angle of refraction (Qt) is 90 degrees.
   - This approach confirms that the critical angle is when light just grazes along the interface between the liquid and air.

The explanation emphasizes understanding how light refracts differently depending on whether it moves from a higher to lower refractive index medium, which causes the refracted ray to bend away from the normal. The text concludes by reinforcing the concept of the critical angle in this context.
