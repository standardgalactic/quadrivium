The text provides a detailed walkthrough for solving the definite integral of \((x + 2)^2\) from -1 to 1, ultimately calculating it from 1 to -1 by reversing limits and adjusting the sign.

Here's a summary:

1. **Integral Setup**: The integral in question is \(\int_{-1}^{1} (x + 2)^2 \, dx\).

2. **Reversal of Limits**: By changing the order of integration from \([-1, 1]\) to \([1, -1]\), we introduce a negative sign: \(-\int_{1}^{-1} (x + 2)^2 \, dx\).

3. **Expanding the Function**: Expand \((x + 2)^2\) into \(x^2 + 4x + 4\).

4. **Integration**:
   - The antiderivative of \(x^2\) is \(\frac{1}{3}x^3\).
   - The antiderivative of \(4x\) is \(2x^2\).
   - The antiderivative of 4 is \(4x\).

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the integrated function from 1 to -1:
   - At \(x = 1\), substitute into \(\frac{1}{3}x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x\) resulting in \(\frac{1}{3}(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 4(1) = \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 4\).
   - At \(x = -1\), substitute into \(-\left(\frac{1}{3}(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1)\right)\) resulting in \(-\left(-\frac{1}{3} + 2 - 4\right)\).

6. **Final Calculation**: 
   - Combine results: The difference is \((\frac{1}{3} + 2 + 4) - (-\frac{1}{3} + 2 - 4)\).
   - Simplify to get the final result of \(-\frac{26}{3}\).

The integral evaluates to \(-\frac{26}{3}\).
