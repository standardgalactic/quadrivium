The text provides a detailed walkthrough for solving the definite integral of \((x + 2)^2\) from -1 to 1, ultimately calculating it from 1 to -1 by reversing limits and adjusting the sign.

Here's a summary:

1. **Integral Setup**: The integral in question is \(\int_{-1}^{1} (x + 2)^2 \, dx\).

2. **Reversal of Limits**: By changing the order of integration from \([-1, 1]\) to \([1, -1]\), we introduce a negative sign: \(-\int_{1}^{-1} (x + 2)^2 \, dx\).

3. **Expanding the Function**: Expand \((x + 2)^2\) into \(x^2 + 4x + 4\).

4. **Integration**:
   - The antiderivative of \(x^2\) is \(\frac{1}{3}x^3\).
   - The antiderivative of \(4x\) is \(2x^2\).
   - The antiderivative of 4 is \(4x\).

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the integrated function from 1 to -1:
   - At \(x = 1\), substitute into \(\frac{1}{3}x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x\) resulting in \(\frac{1}{3}(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 4(1) = \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 4\).
   - At \(x = -1\), substitute into \(-\left(\frac{1}{3}(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1)\right)\) resulting in \(-\left(-\frac{1}{3} + 2 - 4\right)\).

6. **Final Calculation**: 
   - Combine results: The difference is \((\frac{1}{3} + 2 + 4) - (-\frac{1}{3} + 2 - 4)\).
   - Simplify to get the final result of \(-\frac{26}{3}\).

The integral evaluates to \(-\frac{26}{3}\).

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of how to evaluate the definite integral from -1 to 1 of \( (x + 2)^2 \) with respect to \( x \). It begins by acknowledging the task might seem daunting but emphasizes breaking it down into manageable steps.

First, it notes that integrating from left to right on the x-axis is standard practice. However, since the given integral's limits are from -1 to 1, the text suggests reversing these limits, which introduces a negative sign in front of the integral: \(-\int_{-1}^{1} (x + 2)^2 \, dx\).

Next, it expands \( (x + 2)^2 \) into \( x^2 + 4x + 4 \). The task then becomes integrating this expression from -1 to 1.

The antiderivatives are found as follows:
- For \( x^2 \), the antiderivative is \( \frac{x^3}{3} \).
- For \( 4x \), the antiderivative is \( 2x^2 \).
- For 4, the antiderivative is \( 4x \).

Substituting these into the integral expression with limits -1 and 1, the calculation proceeds:
\[ 
-\left[ \frac{1^3}{3} + 2(1)^2 + 4(1) - \left(\frac{(-1)^3}{3} + 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1)\right) \right]
\]

Simplifying the expression, we find:
- For \( x = 1 \): \( \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 4 \).
- For \( x = -1 \): \( -\frac{1}{3} + 2 - 4 \).

Calculating these values gives:
\[ 
-\left[ \left(\frac{1}{3} + 2 + 4\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{3} + 2 - 4\right) \right] = -\left( \frac{1}{3} + 6 + \frac{1}{3} - 2 + 4 \right)
\]

Combining terms:
\[ 
-\left(\frac{2}{3} + 8\right) = -\left(\frac{26}{3}\right) = -\frac{26}{3}
\]

Thus, the definite integral evaluates to \(-\frac{26}{3}\).
