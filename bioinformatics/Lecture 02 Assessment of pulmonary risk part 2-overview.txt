The text discusses management strategies for patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) undergoing surgery. These patients are at high risk for post-operative complications like apnea, desaturation, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, necessitating careful pre- and post-operative assessment and monitoring.

Preoperatively, measures include:

1. **Spirometry**: Patients can be trialed on preoperative spirometry or incentive spirometry to improve lung parameters.
2. **Exercise and Weight Loss**: Encouraging improved exercise status and weight loss, though often challenging due to time constraints.
3. **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)**: Using a CPAP device before surgery can be beneficial.
4. **Mandibular Advancement Devices**: These may also help manage symptoms.

Identifying at-risk patients involves using tools like the Berlin questionnaire and, ideally, an overnight sleep test, though not all facilities offer this.

Improving overall patient outcomes includes:

- Encouraging preoperative incentive spirometry to enhance lung capacity.
- Improving nutritional status where possible.
- Advising smoking cessation for at least six to eight weeks prior to surgery to reduce complication risks.

Risk calculators, such as those developed by Gupta et al., can predict the risk of post-operative pneumonia and respiratory failure based on factors like procedure type, ASA class, age, COPD presence, functional status, preoperative sepsis, and smoking. These tools help identify high-risk patients for better management.

In summary, careful assessment, tailored preoperative interventions, and utilizing predictive tools are key to managing OSAS patients in a surgical context.
