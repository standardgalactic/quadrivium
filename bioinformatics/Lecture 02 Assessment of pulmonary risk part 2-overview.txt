The text discusses management strategies for patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) undergoing surgery. These patients are at high risk for post-operative complications like apnea, desaturation, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, necessitating careful pre- and post-operative assessment and monitoring.

Preoperatively, measures include:

1. **Spirometry**: Patients can be trialed on preoperative spirometry or incentive spirometry to improve lung parameters.
2. **Exercise and Weight Loss**: Encouraging improved exercise status and weight loss, though often challenging due to time constraints.
3. **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)**: Using a CPAP device before surgery can be beneficial.
4. **Mandibular Advancement Devices**: These may also help manage symptoms.

Identifying at-risk patients involves using tools like the Berlin questionnaire and, ideally, an overnight sleep test, though not all facilities offer this.

Improving overall patient outcomes includes:

- Encouraging preoperative incentive spirometry to enhance lung capacity.
- Improving nutritional status where possible.
- Advising smoking cessation for at least six to eight weeks prior to surgery to reduce complication risks.

Risk calculators, such as those developed by Gupta et al., can predict the risk of post-operative pneumonia and respiratory failure based on factors like procedure type, ASA class, age, COPD presence, functional status, preoperative sepsis, and smoking. These tools help identify high-risk patients for better management.

In summary, careful assessment, tailored preoperative interventions, and utilizing predictive tools are key to managing OSAS patients in a surgical context.

The text discusses strategies for managing patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) to mitigate post-operative risks. These patients have a higher likelihood of experiencing apnea, desaturation, pneumonia, and respiratory failure after surgery. Preoperative assessment by an anesthesia provider is crucial, and it's recommended that these patients be monitored in high-care facilities post-surgery.

Preoperatively, interventions like preoperative spirometry or incentive spirometry can improve lung parameters, though creating such devices may be necessary if they're unavailable. Improving exercise status and weight loss are also beneficial but challenging due to time constraints. Other options include using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices or mandibular advancement devices before surgery.

To identify patients at risk for OSAS, the Berlin questionnaire can be used as a screening tool, while an overnight sleep test is considered the gold standard despite its limited availability. For all surgical patients, including those with sleep apnea, preoperative incentive spirometry has been shown to reduce post-operative complications, such as in laparoscopic cholecystectomies.

Improving nutritional status and encouraging smoking cessation (at least six to eight weeks prior) can also decrease the risk of complications. The use of risk calculators, like those developed by Gupta et al., helps identify patients at increased risk for pneumonia or respiratory failure based on factors such as procedure type, ASA class, age, COPD presence, functional status, and smoking.

The text concludes with a recommendation to better manage high-risk patients using these tools and techniques, with a future focus on managing diabetic patients.
