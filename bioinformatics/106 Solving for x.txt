In this video lecture I just want to do a bit of fun algebra and we're going to solve for x.
First of all let's try and get the roots of polynomials. I'm going to import Sympy as my
abbreviation SYM. I'm going to print to the screen using PrettyPrinting. In other words,
SYM.init underscore printing open and close parentheses and I'm going to have my variables
x, y, and z separated by commas there as symbols. So it's SYM.symbols open and close parentheses and
I have x, y, and z in that order so that the variable x is the first listed there becomes
the first listed there symbol x etc. And you'll note one little difference from the code I used
before where as I put no commas there on the as the arguments and the symbols section here you can
put commas. It's not going to make a difference. And I'm going to print to the screen this string
the equation colon and then on the next line I'm going to have an equation SYM.eq. It takes two
arguments here on before the comma I have my expression x squared minus x the comma and then
on the right hand side whatever I want on the right hand side of the equation I put after the
comma as the second argument and if I run that code very beautifully I have x squared minus x equals
zero. So that's what the equation does. It takes the two arguments there what is on the left hand
side what's on the right hand side of the equal sign. So I can get the roots of this equation just be
careful you have to convert the equation in your head or on paper just to an expression. In other words
you just got to have zero on the right hand side so that all your variables and your your constants
are on the left hand side. So I can only have x squared minus x that's the expression. So it's SYM.solve
is how to get the roots of an expression. So on the left hand side of this comma the first argument is my
expression x squared x squared minus x and on the right hand side I want what variable I want the
roots for. I want the roots for variable x. So if I run this I see indeed my roots are zero and one
and we know if we take out x we can have x and then x minus one in brackets equaling zero so x is either
zero or x equals one so that's quite correct there. So it will solve that. Here's another equation I have
x squared plus two or it could have been remember if I just had the equation I could have had x squared
equals negative two but I've brought it all to the left hand side now so it's going to be pretty
x squared plus two equals zero and I can show you that some pi can do complex roots as well so SYM.solve
again to get the roots I have x squared plus two and I want the roots for x so that'll be negative
square root of 2i and the imaginary number i or square root of 2i so that works very well. I just
want to show you here so if this was negative 2 on this side so if I listed that it would do that for
me x squared minus two but if I want the roots of that I've got to take that minus two over to the
other side so that I just have my expression this homogeneous equation in other words it being equal
to zero so I have everything in my expression that was on the left hand side here and I want the roots
for x. Let's factor something this expression can be factorized x squared minus four let's just print it
to the screen I have x squared minus four and if I want to factorize it I'm not looking for the roots
I'm just factorizing it and the keyword for that is factor so it's SYM dot factor lower case f
x squared minus four and if I print that it will factorize it as x minus two and x plus two
so the opposite of factorization is simplification so here again I'm going to use this x minus two times
x plus two which is what we had up there I'm just going to print it to the screen
and there I have x minus two x plus two so in the pretty printing it just removes
this multiplication sign which I have to put in the code but in the printing it's just going to do it
the way that you used to do it on paper and now instead of factor I'm going to simplify so SYM dot
simplify and then open and close parentheses and I have x minus two times x plus two and I have these
parentheses here just so that I have the order of arithmetical calculations just correct there
and if I do that I'm going to simplify x minus two and x plus two back to x squared minus four now you
might not say that is a simplification but that's the way sim pi the keywords for sim pi are if you
want this multiplied out you use the simplify and if you want it to be written in a simpler form
meaning it's the x squared the power that is broken down into first order variables there first order
polynomials each one of these factors you use the factor keyword so look at this very long
expression here x cubed plus x squared minus x minus one over x squared plus two x plus one
so quite a daunting both numerator and denominator polynomials in both and if I use factor now so
what's factor going to do remember it's going to expand these but what it will also do it will do
cancellation all in one go let me show you so I have SYM dot factor I have my numerator my denominator
exactly the same as up there and if I run that code I'm just going to be left with x minus one
the reason for that is let's just factorize the numerator there I have the numerator and I'm using
factor if I do that I see it's x minus one and x plus one squared and if I factorize the denominator
I have this and lo and behold this x plus one all squared and x plus one all squared are we're going to
cancel out and I'm left with x minus one so it's not going to give you when you use factor there all of
these factors it's also going to do the cancellation for you you can though have a list of all the factors
so if I use this keyword factor underscore list and again I am with my with my same expression there that
I had in my numerator before if I ask for the factor list now look what it does it says there's an x minus one
once it appears once the x minus one the x plus one appears twice hence it was x plus one squared all squared
and all of them combined just occur once so I just have this one two three I have these three factors
and they just appear once if all of them were repeated this would have been a two so just
carefully look at the way that this is constructed this part here x minus one is one of the factors
x plus one is one of the factors this value after the comma tells me how many times that factor appears
the x plus one appears twice and then both of them combined appear once now for one of the beauties of
simpi and that's the just relieving the pain of doing partial fractions which is always a pain takes a
while to do easy to make tiny little mistakes when you do it on paper and it's not to say that you
should not have the skill to do any of these things on paper but just to check your results or in the real
world just to get the quick and dirty answer I have this huge expression that I want the partial
fractions of 4x cubed plus 21x squared plus 10x plus 12 over x to the power 4 plus 5x cubed plus 5x squared
plus 4x and the keyword for that is apart SYM dot apart which is going to give me the partial fractions
at the push of a button oh imagine all the paperwork that had to go into that and boom within milliseconds
there is my solution is that not a thing of beauty now I can go backwards by simplifying this remember
simplify is now going to find a common denominator and reconstruct this for me I put this in here
just to show you so the code that I've put down here my expression after the simplify is exactly this
if I run that it's not going to bring me back completely to what I had there it was just going
to have that x outside but if I had distributed that x into this factor in the denominator it was
going to be exactly the same as that so I can get the partial fractions beautifully and I can
recombine them with a common denominator back into the original expression now I am not only stuck in
some part just with one single equation I can also solve more than one occasion a system of equations
once again I just want to warn you that you have to have everything on the left hand side
equals zero so it's x plus y minus one equals zero and my second is x minus y minus one equals zero so
I've bought that minus one over from the right hand side it must have been x plus y equals one and
y minus one equals one which you've got to bring it all to the side they've got to equal zero so you've
got to have this homogeneous set of equations so I'm solving the system but just note slightly different
syntax I have my after solve which we've used before for single expression solutions I've got open and
closed parentheses and I've got the two arguments separated by a comma but they do have to go into
square brackets so I have my two expressions here from my two equations comma and again in square brackets
the two variables that I'm after it's a system of solutions and I want a solution for x and for y
so if I run that I see x equals one and y equals zero just to show you we can get a bit more complex
remember right in the beginning I made z the variable z a symbol z or z as well so it's going to work here
and I have three of them still within the solve I have my open and closed parentheses
but now I'm taking the two arguments still my first argument goes in square brackets there and there
comma my second argument in square brackets there you'll see I want solutions for x y and z it's a
system of three equations and three unknowns so it's three times x plus 2y plus z minus 10 my second is x plus
2y plus 4z minus 12 and my last one is 2x plus 2y plus z minus 8 low and behold it will do that
system of equations solve that for me x equals 2 y equals 1 z equals 2 if you were to put these values
into these variables you'll see all three expressions they equal zero so beautiful way to do algebra and
you can really simplify your life or just to check your homework with beautiful
