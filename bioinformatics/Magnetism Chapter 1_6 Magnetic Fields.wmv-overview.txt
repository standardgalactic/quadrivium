To solve the problem involving motion in a magnetic field, we need to break down the motion into components perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. Hereâ€™s how you can approach it:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Kinetic Energy Conversion**:  
   Convert the given kinetic energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). Use the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\).

2. **Velocity Calculation**:  
   Use the kinetic energy formula:
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]
   Solve for \(v\):
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}}
   \]
   where \(m\) is the mass of an electron (\(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\)).

3. **Velocity Components**:  
   - **Parallel Component** (\(v_{\parallel}\)):  
     \[
     v_{\parallel} = v \cos(\phi)
     \]
   - **Perpendicular Component** (\(v_{\perp}\)):  
     \[
     v_{\perp} = v \sin(\phi)
     \]

4. **Radius of Helical Path**:  
   The radius \(r\) of the helical path is determined by the perpendicular component:
   \[
   r = \frac{mv_{\perp}}{|q|B}
   \]
   where \(q\) is the charge of an electron (\(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)) and \(B\) is the magnetic field strength.

5. **Period of Motion**:  
   The period \(T\) (time for one complete loop) is given by:
   \[
   T = \frac{2\pi m}{|q|B}
   \]
   This depends only on the perpendicular velocity component, as it determines the circular motion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.

6. **Pitch of Helix**:  
   The pitch \(d\) (distance traveled parallel to the magnetic field in one period) is:
   \[
   d = v_{\parallel} \times T
   \]
   Substitute \(v_{\parallel}\) and \(T\) into this equation.

### Summary

- **Perpendicular Motion**: Causes circular motion, determining the radius and period.
- **Parallel Motion**: Causes linear motion along the field line, determining the pitch of the helix.

By following these steps, you can calculate the necessary parameters for an electron moving at an angle in a magnetic field. Make sure to keep track of units and conversion factors throughout your calculations.
