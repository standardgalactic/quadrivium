To solve the problem involving motion in a magnetic field, we need to break down the motion into components perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. Hereâ€™s how you can approach it:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Kinetic Energy Conversion**:  
   Convert the given kinetic energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). Use the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\).

2. **Velocity Calculation**:  
   Use the kinetic energy formula:
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]
   Solve for \(v\):
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}}
   \]
   where \(m\) is the mass of an electron (\(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\)).

3. **Velocity Components**:  
   - **Parallel Component** (\(v_{\parallel}\)):  
     \[
     v_{\parallel} = v \cos(\phi)
     \]
   - **Perpendicular Component** (\(v_{\perp}\)):  
     \[
     v_{\perp} = v \sin(\phi)
     \]

4. **Radius of Helical Path**:  
   The radius \(r\) of the helical path is determined by the perpendicular component:
   \[
   r = \frac{mv_{\perp}}{|q|B}
   \]
   where \(q\) is the charge of an electron (\(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)) and \(B\) is the magnetic field strength.

5. **Period of Motion**:  
   The period \(T\) (time for one complete loop) is given by:
   \[
   T = \frac{2\pi m}{|q|B}
   \]
   This depends only on the perpendicular velocity component, as it determines the circular motion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.

6. **Pitch of Helix**:  
   The pitch \(d\) (distance traveled parallel to the magnetic field in one period) is:
   \[
   d = v_{\parallel} \times T
   \]
   Substitute \(v_{\parallel}\) and \(T\) into this equation.

### Summary

- **Perpendicular Motion**: Causes circular motion, determining the radius and period.
- **Parallel Motion**: Causes linear motion along the field line, determining the pitch of the helix.

By following these steps, you can calculate the necessary parameters for an electron moving at an angle in a magnetic field. Make sure to keep track of units and conversion factors throughout your calculations.

The text provided seems to discuss the motion of a charged particle (such as an electron) moving at an angle through a magnetic field. This scenario involves both helical and linear motion components, described by concepts like velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. Let's break down some of these key ideas:

### Key Concepts

1. **Magnetic Force on a Moving Charge**: 
   - A charged particle moving in a magnetic field experiences a force given by \( \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) \), where \( q \) is the charge, \( \mathbf{v} \) is the velocity vector of the particle, and \( \mathbf{B} \) is the magnetic field vector.
   - This force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field.

2. **Helical Motion**:
   - If a charged particle enters a uniform magnetic field at an angle that's not parallel or antiparallel to the field, its path becomes helical (spiral-like).
   - The component of velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field causes circular motion.
   - The component of velocity parallel to the magnetic field remains constant and causes linear motion along the direction of the magnetic field.

3. **Velocity Components**:
   - \( v_{\parallel} = v \cos(\phi) \): Velocity parallel to the magnetic field.
   - \( v_{\perp} = v \sin(\phi) \): Velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field, causing circular motion.

4. **Radius of Circular Motion (Larmor Radius)**:
   - The radius of the helical path is given by \( r = \frac{mv_{\perp}}{|q|B} \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle.
   - This describes how far from the magnetic field line the particle spirals.

5. **Pitch of the Helix**:
   - The pitch (\( d \)) of the helix, which is the distance between successive turns along the direction parallel to the magnetic field, is given by \( d = v_{\parallel} T \).
   - Here, \( T \) is the period of one complete circle in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field and is calculated as \( T = \frac{2\pi m}{|q|B} \).

### Solving for Pitch

Given:
- Kinetic energy (\( KE = 22.5 \) eV, which needs conversion to joules using \( 1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \) J).
- Mass of electron (\( m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \) kg).
- Charge of electron (\( q_e = -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \) C).

#### Steps:

1. **Convert Kinetic Energy to Joules**:
   \( KE = 22.5 \, \text{eV} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 3.6 \times 10^{-18} \) J.

2. **Find Velocity**:
   Use the kinetic energy formula: \( KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 \).
   Solve for \( v \): 
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot KE}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 3.6 \times 10^{-18}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}} \approx 8.89 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( v_{\parallel} \) and \( v_{\perp} \)**:
   - \( v_{\parallel} = v \cos(\phi) \)
   - \( v_{\perp} = v \sin(\phi) \)

4. **Determine the Period (\( T \))**:
   \[
   T = \frac{2\pi m}{|q|B}
   \]

5. **Calculate Pitch (\( d \))**:
   \[
   d = v_{\parallel} T = (v \cos(\phi)) \left(\frac{2\pi m}{|q|B}\right)
   \]

By understanding these components, you can solve for the pitch of a charged particle's helical path in a magnetic field. The key is to correctly identify and use the parallel and perpendicular velocity components relative to the magnetic field direction.
