This text provides a detailed overview of managing patients with cardiac conditions undergoing surgery. It highlights the importance of evaluating these patients preoperatively to minimize complications and ensure efficient resource use while adhering to regulatory requirements.

Key points include:

1. **Prevalence**: Cardiac complications occur in 1-3% of non-cardiac surgeries.
2. **Evaluation Importance**: Assessing cardiac status is essential for positive surgical outcomes.
3. **Regulatory Considerations**: Patient consent and adherence to local protocols are crucial.

The lecture introduces a management algorithm based on guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA). This involves assessing:

- Critical cardiac conditions
- Surgical risk levels
- Functional capacity in METs
- Clinical risk factors

The ASA classification system is used for preoperative evaluation. Active cardiac issues like unstable coronary syndromes or significant arrhythmias may necessitate enhanced cardiac reserves or surgical plan modifications.

Surgery risks are categorized into low, intermediate, and high based on potential cardiac complications due to hemodynamic effects or fluid shifts. The Lee Index identifies five primary cardiac risk factors: ischemic heart disease, heart failure, insulin-dependent diabetes, renal insufficiency, and cerebrovascular disease, with other non-predictive factors like obesity also noted.

For emergencies, manage cardiac status intra- and postoperatively; for non-emergencies, evaluate cardiac conditions and functional capacity. Low-risk surgeries can proceed as planned, while intermediate or high-risk ones require further assessment.

Patients with coronary artery interventions need careful planning:

1. **Balloon Angioplasty**: Delay surgery within two weeks.
2. **Bare Metal Stents**: Postpone surgery for 30-45 days post-placement.
3. **Drug Eluting Stents**: A one-year waiting period is recommended before surgery.

Preoperative ECGs are useful primarily for diagnosing severe arrhythmias, with guidelines recommending their use based on age and cardiac history. Perioperative statin use should continue as advised by the ACC and AHA, despite uncertainties about beta blockers' risks and benefits due to recent research irregularities.

The text advises against discontinuing cardiovascular medications like alpha-2 agonists or ACE inhibitors preoperatively due to potential health issues. Hypertensive patients require close monitoring during surgery. The goal of preoperative consultations is optimizing cardiac management to enhance reserve capacity and reduce surgical risks, with further non-invasive or invasive investigations left to cardiologists' discretion.

The next lecture will address pulmonary conditions.
