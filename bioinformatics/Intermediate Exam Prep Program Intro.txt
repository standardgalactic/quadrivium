Why are you here?
So first of all, why are you here?
So you see upside down there.
I put it upside down because it's that important for me.
This is not a didactic lecture series.
So I'm not going to stand it and give you a lecture.
Now in the beginning,
in the beginning I might do it
because I ask you questions and you don't know the answer
and I'm going to say one or two things,
or if no one around the table really knows
and I know the answer, which doesn't always happen,
I'll tell you the answer, but that's not the point.
You're not here to be spoon-fed.
You're a postgraduate student.
So when you're at your age now,
someone who's on main campus
is already a postdoctoral student
contributing massively to their field
and you're just little kids running around
drawing blood, filling in forms,
phoning for beds.
There's a great discrepancy between what's happening here
and what happens in the real world.
It's a very artificial world, medicine.
And really to be in your shoes and still get a lecture
with a powerpoint slide and being told,
I think that's absolutely ridiculous.
So that's not going to happen here.
That's not why you're here.
The second reason why you're not here,
you'll see there, that's also supposed to be in red,
is you're not here to pass the exam.
And that's not what we're trying to achieve here.
And I'll get back to that as well.
You're here for one reason,
because you've got to go home and study.
You've got to somehow make you do that.
But not study to pass the exam,
but study to be a doctor, proper surgeon,
or urologist, or whatever.
And that doesn't happen just studying for an exam,
being able to regurgitate what you know
and by next week you've forgotten it.
That misses the point completely.
And that's how this world unfortunately is set up.
But that's just wrong.
What I want from this exam
is for people to love the idea of knowing stuff.
The only way you know stuff
is to open the books and read
and pay attention in the ward
and be in the ward and get some work done.
You know, various stuff that you're going through.
But that should not stop the time that the exam is finishing
when you pick it up again for the finals.
And then you start studying again.
Something is terribly wrong with that picture.
That surgeon I don't want anywhere near me
or my family when I'm sick and need surgery.
You don't.
And for exams to create that kind of situation
where you're just trying to study for the exam,
that's just wrong.
No one will convince me that that's right.
So, one reason for you being here
is to also realise that
if you want to run a 10k race
or a marathon or a 100k sprint,
you don't just pitch up on the day.
You exercise.
You exercise well in the brain.
Your brain is the exact same thing.
You're not just going to know things.
You've got to work at it.
Last, perhaps, reason why you're here
is it's easy for you to think about something.
You see something in the ward.
We do ward rounds.
Or you see a patient.
You walk away.
You think about it.
And you might know the answer,
but that's quite a different thing
from vocalising the answer.
And that's the training,
part of the training bit as well.
You've got to learn to take the knowledge in your head
and vocalise it.
Walking into the exam
and that's the first time you hear your own voice.
That's just wrong.
You are going to stutter
and you are going to say bad things
and you are.
It just doesn't work.
So, after this is done,
you've talked so much.
You're so used to talking.
You're so used to, you know,
interacting vocally with an examiner
that when you walk in there
you're a fully trained athlete
and you're ready for that 10K run
or marathon run or whatever.
It's only 20 minutes times two,
so it's not that bad.
So, just the exam,
you know you're going to do the MCQ.
Initially, people were quite against MCQs,
but there's a lot of literature out.
This type of literature
that you won't be reading
because you're reading to pass your exams.
I shouldn't say that now,
to become a good surgeon.
But the MCQs,
there's a lot of literature out on that
to show that it is,
if not as good as,
better in testing higher cognitive function
than a short or medium or long form question.
The problem with that literature is
that literature,
that research obviously gets done
on very properly set questions.
It's not just pulling, you know,
200 MCQs out of a hat
and making people write that
and doing research on that
to show if it tests cognitive function or not.
So, those are very select questions.
You can imagine that
when the research is done on these things.
And that's not the same in this exam.
This exam is just,
the college keeps on asking people
just to submit questions.
And the South Africans say questions.
It doesn't come from those UK books
and all of those.
It's local stuff.
But as we stand out as of now,
there is no quality control on those.
And we know, for instance,
in the last exams,
you know,
it was women with prostate cancer.
You know,
it was that bad.
Apparently,
the spelling mistakes were,
you know,
the grammar,
spelling mistakes,
it was horrible.
So,
that's,
you know,
that's just the worst part of it.
But,
second worst part,
worst part of it probably
is that none of us
doing these exams,
setting up these MCQs,
have been properly trained
how to do it.
We all think we can.
That's part of being a surgeon.
You think you can do everything.
Because you can do one thing,
that automatically means
you can do everything else,
which is just nonsense.
So,
even though it's been shown
to test higher
autocognitive function,
I'm not convinced
in our setting it does,
and I'm not convinced
that a student
who passes the MCQs
actually knows their work.
I don't know if it's always
indicative of you
knowing your work.
And, you know,
some people do fail it,
and I think to myself,
when I interacted with that person,
that person really knew
what he was doing,
and then he or she,
and then they failed the MCQ.
And that for me
is a clear cut,
you know,
indication,
sort of,
that the MCQs
did not properly test that person.
Something else was going on there.
And there's some people
who are always quite amazed
past the MCQ
because they thought
they knew nothing.
So, you know,
for us extrapolating
the research that's out there,
on our MCQs
I'm not quite convinced.
And furthermore,
the way,
and it's not going to change
by the time you do your finals,
is the first world
is really moving towards
competency-based examinations,
and competency-based training.
And that's not
what we do locally.
No one knows
how you can operate
by the time you're done.
No one knows
if you're a good doctor,
if you interact well
with patients,
if you can communicate well,
if you have
the correct levels
of sympathy,
empathy,
and worst of all,
we don't know
how you operate
because no one
ever judges that.
And especially
in the finals,
even the interaction
you have with the examiner,
there's purely subjective
evaluation
of your knowledge.
And that is just,
I mean,
that has now been,
I think,
most first world
training institutions
has been shunned.
The way we're doing it,
it served us well
in the past,
but the world
has moved on from this.
Okay?
And the reason for me
is just to diminish
the power that the exams
hold over you.
You know,
let that go.
the way that we examine
still in this country
is old-fashioned,
useless type of examination.
Okay?
So rather,
prepare yourself
to be a good surgeon.
And a by-product of that
would be that you pass
these two silly exams
that still lie
and wait for you.
Okay?
With time,
I know, like,
Stella Bosch
is signing up for CanMeds.
CanMeds is a way
of training
which is really being
accepted in most,
you know,
in many places in the world
as a proper training methods
and,
and,
and,
and evaluation methods.
And we've got a long ways
to get there,
but Stella Bosch,
I know,
is signing up to,
to the CanMeds method
that comes from Canada.
And it's really,
uh,
um,
training a 360 degree
or full,
uh,
specialist
as opposed to
this really,
small,
goal-directed way
in which we do.
But,
so the MCQ,
you've got to pass.
Um,
as I say,
an hour setting
is not always indicative
of if you know your work
or not.
So if you fail that little hurdle,
just try the next time.
It really isn't indicative
of whether you know your work
or not.
Oral is something different.
You know,
there's a face-to-face,
it's not a piece of paper.
You're sitting in front of someone
who can actually laugh
in your face
and that's not,
that's where the,
the stress comes in.
Okay?
So that's a whole different
interaction.
that will,
will,
will exercise here
as if there's no tomorrow.
You'll really,
when you walk in there,
you should be so
well-trained
in handling that situation.
And,
if you didn't attend this
and just went in there
versus attending this,
there should be a big,
big difference.
Okay?
So,
the subject matter,
what,
you know,
that's on the website,
on the college's website,
what the subject matter is
for this.
People,
examiners go way beyond
what's on those,
on those web pages.
Okay,
this is a very open-ended exam.
They can ask you anything
and some,
some examiners go way overboard.
I think,
um,
last time people asked about
research into pediatric surgery
and,
some funny thing about that,
I think,
you know,
which is,
I can't remember exactly
what it was,
a silly example perhaps,
there were many more examples
of people going way outside of that,
but that doesn't mean
that's incorrect to do that.
You know,
when we sit beforehand
and we get our brief
in the morning
before we start,
the goal of that exam
is just to identify
the candidates
who we feel are safe
to carry on
to the final exam.
Or,
they need six more months
of experience.
That's what we,
that's the goal of that,
that exam.
Okay?
And that means
that people might ask
stuff that is outside of that.
But usually,
if you paid attention
while you were in the ward,
it shouldn't be too much
of a problem,
even if you didn't read that.
Get yourself a good textbook.
That's what the text stands for.
Now,
any of these big green fields,
any of those textbooks,
obviously,
the select chapters in that,
the chapters on trauma,
the chapters on wound care,
wound healing,
you know,
those genetic chapters,
they always form a good basis.
There's multiple open
educational resources these days.
You know,
go on Medscape,
any of these websites,
even on YouTube,
you know,
search for lectures on,
on a topic.
And I'll get to why
I want you to do the whole lot.
And review articles.
It is fantastic if a candidate
can quote a randomized controlled trial
that was published two months ago
in the exam.
Okay?
But there's just too many of those.
You know,
if you can do that,
be very,
be,
be very sure that you're quoting
things correctly
because usually the examiner read that
and,
you know,
he,
he reads it with different eyes than you
or she
and,
and you might get into trouble.
So if there's one thing you have,
I really advise you to do
is get some good review articles
on each of these subjects.
Textbooks are old,
they get old quickly
and the review is,
instead of you having to go search
for all these things,
it's,
it combines it all in one for you
in a nice,
neat little article.
So where do you find these articles?
You know,
that's on PubMed.
I've given you a,
a link there that you can type in.
That takes you to a YouTube tutorial
made by PubMed itself
on how to do a proper PubMed search.
And if we have time,
for some groups
who've actually stepped by a computer
and actually did it.
This particular training video
is on mesh headings.
Do you know what mesh headings are?
Medical subject headings.
It's a much better way of searching
specifically for something like review articles.
If you just type in your search term,
how many irrelevant things come up?
And,
it's usually just the page
after you stopped
that the good one was.
But you,
you must have,
because you didn't,
you didn't go to the next page.
You were fed up.
Okay.
There's a,
there's a way around that
to get to the good stuff.
The stuff that you're really interested in
is using mesh headings.
It's a short little tutorial
on how to use PubMed
to get to what you want.
And with 10 results
as opposed to 23,000,
483.
Okay.
I want to just touch on
what to wear on the day.
At UCT
we've got a standing tradition now
that everyone wears the same thing
at the exams.
It's a beautiful thing to see.
People know,
it's,
it's a thing now.
Speak to people before you.
So men,
you're going to wear a black,
shoes,
black trousers
and a black blazer.
So a black suit.
If there's a thin metal stripe in it,
I always don't want to see it.
That must be like that.
I don't care what you have to go buy,
steal, rent or whatever.
You're going to wear a black suit.
With that,
you're going to wear a white shirt
or a very nearly white shirt
and a very plain tie.
you're going to wear a black suit.
Okay.
What's it?
Blue if you're Republican,
red if you're Democrat.
Blue if you're a,
who's who?
I can never remember.
Republican or Democrat.
Anyway.
So you're going to wear a black suit.
Black business suit-ish kind of thing
for you as well,
with a white blouse.
Okay.
Properly covered up.
Properly professional.
You know.
Something that can compare with a,
with a,
with a,
with a proper suit
that's going to be all black.
And you have no choice in the matter.
I will force this issue.
I tell you now.
It's a tradition.
And it's so nice beforehand
and even afterwards
while people's,
people are waiting.
Oh, when we come in as examiners,
there's a UCT group
and they all,
they're all dressed professionally
and,
and,
you know,
with some regard for,
for what's going on.
Some respect for,
for the,
for the whole process.
So there's no negotiation on that.
There isn't.
Done.
That's what you're going to wear.
The body language,
in which we,
we'll go over these things again,
you know,
in,
in,
in,
in more detail.
But for now,
the body language is,
people are so afraid when they walk in,
what to do.
And people are so nervous
and they do,
do stupid,
stupid things.
The door's going to be open for you
and someone's going to invite you in.
Don't walk in before that.
Okay.
Don't walk up
and try and shake people's hands
because that always happens
and some people seem to think
that that would endear you to,
and,
and somehow,
you know,
give you some extra points
or,
or make some connection
between you and the examiner.
This is nonsense.
You wait for that person to,
to,
get up and,
and,
and try and shake your hand.
Otherwise you don't.
Don't put your hand out
because,
you know me,
I don't shake hands to start off with.
I just look at you
and I say sit down
and it's like really awkward.
Okay.
But it doesn't get you any bonus points.
Neither does smiling
or making a little joke
or going ha ha ha
or,
you know,
doing some funny thing.
People do the weirdest nonsense
when they walk in there.
It's just ridiculous to see
and by candidate number 20
it really gets irritating,
you know,
and actually doesn't buy you.
It actually detracts from,
you know,
from what you're trying to create there.
So we'll go over that
in quite a bit of detail.
How to walk in,
what to do.
Don't just sit down.
You know,
sort of indicate towards the seat.
Someone will say sit down,
you know,
but don't make it awkward.
It's natural.
Because after all of this exercise
you're going to walk in there
and have a discussion
with a colleague
about a few topics.
That's the whole idea.
You're not going to walk in there
as student and examiner.
That's just wrong.
You're walking with that attitude
that's lost.
The candidate,
it's so beautiful
to see someone come in there
who's relaxed
and they have a discussion with you.
And it's very easy to force someone,
even perceiving them
to be of a much higher standing
than you,
to force them into a discussion
versus question, answer,
question, answer,
question, answer.
Then you've lost.
Not lost,
you can still pass.
Okay.
But,
to force that kind of discussion issue.
That is,
that is the most beautiful thing
to see on this side of the table.
I cannot tell you
what an impression that creates.
Okay.
Those are the candidates
that do well.
So that's what we're going to try and do.
So how do you fail?
So,
you know,
if everyone else
from other universities
watching this,
sorry for them,
but from this university
no one fails.
None of you are allowed to fail.
It's not allowed either.
Just as much as not wearing
proper black suit on the day
is not allowed.
Failing is not allowed.
So what happened?
You know,
how did you get into med school?
Well,
at least in my time,
I think it's still in your time,
you were,
you know,
one of the clever kids in school.
Otherwise,
you didn't get into med school.
Okay.
The really clever kids,
of course,
went to study maths and physics.
But,
anyway,
the second tier people
got into medicine.
Let's put it that way.
And,
you all did well.
Who didn't do well at school?
You know,
somewhere along the line,
you didn't get into this,
you know,
to this career
or university studying medicine
because you were the stupid kid
in the class.
You know,
and now suddenly,
you know,
from being way up there,
now suddenly you get to this exam
and you're worried about failing.
What?
What went wrong?
Huh?
Why suddenly,
now you're afraid of failing?
You were the black,
most of,
most people,
the first in their class
or whatever,
as people come to study medicine.
Usually.
Okay.
And,
or even if you weren't the first,
second, third,
whatever,
now suddenly you're worried about failing.
What happened between
those days and today?
What changed?
You're still a top,
sort of,
cognitively speaking,
still be a top kind of person.
So what,
what's gone wrong?
You know,
were you hammered over your head
as a registrar too many times?
You know,
what,
or,
you know,
I failed to understand
what went from you being a top student
now for you to be worried about failing.
Something's really wrong there.
Is the work really difficult?
For crying out loud,
studying medicine is easy.
Tell me what is difficult about studying medicine.
What is difficult about?
Hmm?
If I asked you something moderately difficult,
you know,
give me a derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equation,
it takes a bit of thinking.
It takes a bit of brain power.
Me asking you the cause of something,
or,
you know,
what you would treat this with.
How the hell is that difficult?
Medicine is not difficult.
I fail to understand.
I,
I,
you can train anyone to be a doctor.
It's really not that difficult.
Where it becomes difficult is,
you don't have enough input data
to make a proper decision
to have a good output,
a good outcome.
And you can take exact two same people,
the exact same thing,
do the exact same thing to them,
and you'll have different outcomes.
Because we don't understand medicine
to a deep enough level yet.
We're still playing around on the surface.
You're not always going to have a good outcome.
Okay?
And if you're not always going to have a good outcome,
then that's what makes this a bit difficult.
That's what makes this a bit difficult.
Okay.
But there's nothing difficult about it.
You've got to memorize a few things,
facts,
and somehow make a few connections
and we'll talk about those.
And you've just got to spit them out somehow,
either to the exams or to the exam.
There's nothing difficult about this.
Really,
go study physics or something hard.
You know,
that's difficult.
This is nothing.
I do not understand the concept
of failing this at all.
I don't know how people fail this.
Okay.
So,
I do not understand the concept
of failing this at all.
I do not understand the concept
of failing this at all.
I do not know how people fail this.
Okay.
So,
other things,
other way people fail
is to say something like
that's how we do it locally.
Okay.
Remember,
we're dealing with a bunch of surgeons here.
Surgeons are not good people.
I said it's for the record.
It's going to be on YouTube.
Everyone in the world can hear this.
You know,
we're difficult people.
It's what makes you,
gives you the ability to do this job.
Something about your character
made you decide this,
which is different from
someone else's character.
Okay.
Somewhere,
somewhere,
there's something going on.
But anyway.
So,
you might not like
what,
the way other people do it.
We,
we're very fond of the way
that we do things.
Okay.
It might be different from
what it's done,
where your examiner's from.
And he might,
or she might take exception to,
to that because
there's some underlying issues going on.
Okay.
Okay.
So,
it's a matter of last resort
to say,
we do that locally.
Who's not to say that
the one thing you do locally
is eminence based
as opposed to evidence based.
A lot of what we do,
don't kid yourself,
is still very eminence based.
In every institution,
there are people who go
straight up against evidence
because in their hands
something else is better
and they'll stick to that.
You know,
and that happens all over the show
and it's silly to think
it doesn't happen here.
So,
never say,
but we do it
and that's not good.
We,
you answer that question
because that is what is stated
in the literature.
That is the proper,
um,
reason behind you deciding
on that answer.
Not because it's done locally.
Okay.
Most of what we do,
obviously we propose
the correct thing,
but don't fall in that trap.
People sometimes get into
arguments with a,
with a,
and then,
and then,
you know,
human factors start playing in
and that's not,
that's not a good thing.
Okay.
So,
try and never ever say
that's what we do locally
no matter how right it is.
That's not an argument
for you choosing that answer.
You read it some way.
There's some,
there's some backup for you
for having chosen that answer.
And then you'll see
the big letters
that white people fail
is because
they succumb
to the pressure
of guessing.
Because you think,
if you say,
if you don't know the answer
you're going to fail.
That is not why
you fail this exam.
You fail this exam,
because you show the examiner,
I'm willing to take the risk
and guess
and hope that I guess correct.
And I just said to you
that we sit beforehand
and we decide.
We let people pass
if we feel that
they are ready to go
on to the finals.
If you are willing
as a surgeon
in training
to guess at how to treat
a patient,
you think you're going to pass.
So,
do not ever succumb
to trying
to get an answer out
because you feel
you have to,
otherwise you're going to fail.
because under those circumstances
you're going to guess incorrectly
and what now?
All the examiner sees
here's a person willing
to take chances
with patients.
I'm not comfortable
with this student.
I'm not going to pass you.
That's why people fail.
That is the biggest reason
for failure.
So,
many, many, many times
in this course
we're going to learn,
I'm going to drill it into you.
You have five seconds.
If you cannot come up
with something within five seconds,
in five seconds
you are going to say
I don't know.
No one has ever failed
because they said
I don't know.
It does not happen.
You do not fail
when you say
I don't know.
You don't have to say
those exact same words.
You've got to play
the situation.
You might say
I don't know.
The next time
I'm up against this issue
whatever,
I'll have to check up on that.
Just play the situation
but it's going to come down
to the fact
that you say
I don't know.
The first thing that happens
that examiner starts pushing
for that,
for that.
Until you start guessing
and guessing wrong
and so then you've lost.
You look him straight back
in the eye,
straight back in the eye,
you say I don't know.
You make them understand
that we stopped the bus here
because it just goes downhill
from there.
Because they won't let it go
because now you start
answering incorrectly
and they go deeper
and deeper
and deeper
and your hole just goes deeper
and deeper and deeper.
Okay.
So no one,
if you don't know
you don't know
you don't know.
It is not the end of the world.
It is not an embarrassment
or some reflection on you.
No one walks in there
knowing everything.
And the guy who tells me
I'm going to go check up
I've got no issue
with that guy.
And that brings me back
to why these exams
are such,
in my view
it's not a good way
of doing things.
Is that
if I asked you
just regurgitate for me
the 16 causes of this
or regurgitate for me
the TNM classification of that.
Does that make you
a good surgeon
in any way?
So unfortunately
you are going to get
questions that are
not proper questions.
Okay.
If you tell me
well I can't remember
the classification of that
but it's something
that's up on a placard
up on the wall
every time you walk in.
Why the hell must I ask
you about that?
And why must I fail you
if you don't know?
If you can just look up there.
Anything that you can
quickly look up on an app
why must I ask you
to regurgitate that?
What I want to know
from you is
do you understand the concept?
Can you deal with this situation?
That's a proper question.
Unfortunately
you are not always
going to get
proper questions
in the exam.
You know
this is not a structured thing.
We are not there yet
with a college
where these things
are done
fully assessed
done in a proper fashion
and objective
as opposed to subjective.
We are still going to do
a subjective test.
Okay.
You don't know
you don't know.
Okay.
So tips on learning
very quickly.
These are things
that happens to you
normally.
The first time you
walked into med school
and to anatomy class
or whatever
you heard something
for the very first time.
You never knew
that that existed.
You can take that
for anything in life.
The first time you hear
about something.
Just before that period
you were unconsciously
incompetent.
You didn't even know
that you didn't know
about this.
Now you hear it
for the first time.
Now you become
consciously incompetent.
At least you know
that you don't know.
At least you know
about it.
Then you go through
it a couple of times
and then you become
consciously competent.
That's usually the level
of these exams.
You have to think about
it and recall it
from memory
and then you do it
for many, many years
and it becomes
second nature
like the first time
you bought your new
phone and you had
to learn that new
operating system.
Now you don't even
think about it.
Now you are
unconsciously competent.
And that's why
it's so easy for
consultants to do
and ask you all sorts
of things.
They've seen it
ten million times.
It's part of their
being now.
They are unconsciously
competent.
It's good if you can
get to that kind of
level for the exam.
But most of the time
you're going to get
stuck by conscious
competence.
So how are you going
to get there?
So that little thing
you see there,
most of you might have
heard about it.
Maybe you are
unconsciously incompetent
going to make you
consciously incompetent.
What is that?
Bloom's taxonomy
of learning.
It starts at the
bottom.
First you see something
and you try and
record it.
That's the remembering.
Once you've
remembered a lot of
stuff you can
start integrating
a little bit
and you understand
it somehow.
From there you
start applying it.
You see patients
and that knowledge
that you have you
can apply it too.
You know how to
treat this.
You know what stuff
to write up.
You start.
You apply this
knowledge and then
eventually you get
to this.
You can create new
things.
You're not just working
on something someone
told you but you're
now in a new situation
which you've never
seen before but you
can integrate and
create a new
solution.
Or you can evaluate
what someone has
told you and you
can tear it apart
a bit and analyze
it and think why
is it so?
I don't agree.
I think you know
you're at a much
higher level.
So how do we go
through all of that?
The first thing you
have to do is you
learn something.
I don't know if you
know how your memory
works.
I'm going to give you
a short physiology
lecture here.
So it's those two,
the amygdala and
hippocampus.
Do you know how you
record stuff into
memory?
Let me tell you
quickly because it's
important.
It will help you
study.
So where's the
amygdala?
It's just in front
of the hippocampus.
So your recording
device is like a
video recorder like
on your phone.
It can record video
audio but it can
do more.
It can record smell,
touch and all sorts
of things that the
video recorder can't.
That sits on the
hippocampus.
But it's got to be
switched on.
So the amygdala sits
there and it's like
in a fight or flight
mode all the time.
And then it says,
oh, something important
is coming and it
wakes up the hippocampus
and says start recording.
Otherwise things just
go through.
How many times have
you done stuff and
the hippocampus was
never recording.
From the hippocampus
it then goes wherever
it needs to go to be
stored.
So the amygdala
tells the hippocampus
hey, start recording.
And what does the
hippocampus require for
you to take in what
is happening there
and convert that to
memory and that
recording?
It requires focus.
In other words you
can't look at your
phone, you can't sit
in the class and then
your mate shows you
something or you're
watching TV while
studying.
There's very good
evidence to suggest
that multitasking
even though females
think they can.
No one can
multitask.
Your hippocampus
is a single stream
that it takes.
It cannot take two
streams.
Okay.
So focus is important.
So who knows how
long your hippocampus
can actually record?
While focusing in
tens.
We've got 15 minutes
on the table.
How long is a
normal lecture in class?
We've got 15 minutes
on the table.
Do I have another?
Do I have another?
20 minutes.
Do I have another?
30 minutes.
Hmm?
No, it's like two or
three minutes.
Okay, we've got a
little budgie there.
But...
Huh?
20 minutes.
You cannot record for
longer than 20 minutes.
That's it.
Glucose up.
Cellular structures up.
Nothing.
Gone.
It doesn't mean you
can't sit in a lecture
for an hour.
But the lecture,
proper lecturer,
will not go beyond
that 20 minutes
and somehow break
in some form or fashion,
changing the discussion,
laughing a bit,
making a joke,
taking people somewhere
else, just giving
that odd few moments
and then starting
the recording again.
And remember,
in a lecture usually
you're not focusing
for 20 minutes.
That's pure focus
that the world
doesn't exist for you.
Okay, if you go
beyond 20 minutes
you will not convert that.
There's no cellular
mechanisms left
to make you record
for longer than 20 minutes.
So if you really
intensely break 20 minutes,
that doesn't mean
you get up,
go to the shops,
go do something.
It just means
you will not record.
And from that
it goes to memory.
Okay, so you learn first
but now,
so it's gone through
that recorder,
now it's got to go
into memory.
And there's good research
to show how that works
as well.
So what is memory?
It's just neuronal pathways
with interconnects.
So the electricity goes
do do do do do do do do
between all those connections,
a bunch of chemical reactions
and that's it,
the chemicals moving across
or sodium potassium
moving across
a membrane.
There's nothing more
than that.
Let's not go into
all sorts of other things.
That's how your
memory works.
You're pure chemical
machine.
Let's stick to that.
And when you form
these connection pathways
there's also good evidence
to suggest those neurons
actually get thicker
and thicker.
They become well insulated, much easier for electricity to pass down there.
So you can change your whole being.
You react to certain stuff just because those pathways are well oiled
and those neurons are quite thick and now you believe you have a certain character
and you respond to certain things in certain ways.
This is nonsense, man. You can change it.
It's difficult to form that new pathway, but you can through habit formation.
It's just new pathways it gets, but this is what you must do here.
So how do you do that? How do you make those connections?
How do you make those neurons go thicker?
First of all, think about learning.
There's some stuff that you know right now.
Know that you studied somewhere, you heard somewhere and you remember naturally.
And try and think about how did that come about?
What was the situation?
What was happening at that time that made me remember this?
And that's why one of the things that this pertains to is how you study.
We all study differently.
Some people like late at night.
Some people like getting up early.
Some people like all sorts of situations.
That plays to this.
Think about when you were successful before in remembering stuff.
Think about it.
And try and recreate that.
Don't try a new way in our study if you're starting studying now.
A way to fit in with your schedule of doing ward rounds and being on call.
Bugger that.
Try and remember when last you were successful.
When last it was easy for you to remember something.
And recreate, sort of try and recreate that scenario.
That helps.
The other is, think about, for instance, things like when you had aha moments.
You know, when something clicked for you.
When something clicked for you, those neuronal pathways connected.
And try and, when you read some stuff, try and make, you know, create those aha moments in some way.
Oh, oh, okay.
For instance, I was asked that in the ward the other day where I saw a patient.
You know, that's an, oh, now I read it here.
Oh, that's an aha moment.
You know, you remember that stuff much better than just reading through and highlighting.
Okay.
Another point is, it's been well shown now that if you write notes, it helps in your memory much more than typing notes.
So this computer in the classroom typing is not as good as, it's actually physically writing.
Okay.
It adds to the muscle memory and all of that.
I, I, I can't remember.
I heard it, read it somewhere.
You know, it's much better than, than typing.
Anyway.
Um, and also build on prior knowledge.
When you bought your new phone, you had an older phone, so you already knew something.
So you just added a little bit.
You didn't learn the new phone all over.
And before that, there was a push button phone in your house.
And if you, as old as I am, there was a phone that you actually had to turn the little wheel on.
And before my time, there was a thing that you had to turn.
And then someone answered and you told them where you wanted to go.
But it's just one knowledge building on the next knowledge.
Okay.
You've already got a substantial amount of knowledge trying to hook stuff onto what you know before.
So these are all just little tricks.
And then the last and probably the most important one is, it's also been shown,
you must take in the same knowledge in different ways.
And that's why I said, where do you get all the stuff that you have to study?
So if you read it, you heard it from somewhere, and you watched a video on it,
or you read three different papers on it.
Three seems to be the minimum.
That you've got to get the same subject into your head in three, from three different sources.
At least three different sources.
It also makes it much easier to form from that hippocampus into long term.
Okay.
So try not just get knowledge on ventilation from one book, or one lecture, or whatever.
Try to, same subject, different ways of getting it in.
Okay.
So, some more tips and tricks.
Social.
Social learning.
We're social beings.
If you discuss something with a mate or a situation like this,
you heard someone else say something happened there, we laughed about it, or whatever,
you walk into that exam, you remember that moment.
Okay.
Social learning is much more important than, or is probably more important than just sitting on your own.
You've got to do it on your own.
You've got to do it on your own.
But discussing this, even outside of this room, but especially in this room,
you're going to have a lot of social interaction.
That really helps.
Then there's lots of evidence on the music.
We all learn different music.
I'm funny.
You all know I love physics and maths, and I teach that as well,
and I'm quite involved with that at university as well.
So if I do physics, I've got to listen to classical music,
and a very specific kind of classical music.
If I do maths, on the other hand, it has got to be pumping, dubstep, acid,
you know, it's really got to, you know, it's got to be a heavy beat to it music,
and that's just weird.
But music, you know, music has been shown.
Then there's got to be some fun aspect to this,
because to do this against your will, and this just becomes a bore and a chore,
man, it's not going to work.
You know, so there's got to be some fun aspect to it,
and even here we're going to have a few laughs.
Light competition is quite important,
and that's very important for being here, because you're all going to see.
You're going to see how he does, he's going to see how she does,
and there's competition around, and I want you to push each other,
because somewhere from around this table, I want, look, after the exam,
we sit there, and each candidate gets discussed in the exam.
We sit in the room, and we wait for the marks to get put on the computer,
they bring it in, they put it on the screen, like it will be in the big room there,
because the exam is here.
We go through each and every candidate, and we can see who did the best.
So it's got to be one of you.
It will not be from another university.
And each of you have got to push, you know, to be better than the other one as well.
Specifically here, I want to see you trying to compete with you,
trying to compete with you, please.
I want to see who's the best, and I want to see who's the worst.
So don't come sit here and be the worst, please.
I'm going to, I'm going to, it's going to be clear who's the worst.
So, a bit of competition. I like competition.
Then everyone seems to think that you've got to repeat stuff.
That's what builds memory. That's not what builds memory.
It's retrieval. So when you read it the second time, try not just reread it again,
try and retrieve it from memory, from the previous time.
So it's not repetition, it's retrieval and re-retrieval.
And after three times you get a drop in your return on investment.
So to go through it for the fourth time, the fifth time, and the sixth time,
that's not as good.
But it's not just pure reading that sentence over again.
It's trying the second time and the third time to retrieve it from memory.
So it's a retrieval aspect.
And there's also good evidence to show that between two episodes,
and I mean you read it now and you're going to read it the second time,
or trying to retrieve it the second time,
you've got to have a period of sleep in between the two.
That has been shown to be much better than doing it this morning and this afternoon.
There's something that happens during the sleep,
doing your sleep between your hippocampus and the neuronal pathways that you're trying to connect.
That sorts things out for you.
Okay.
And it's been studied to such a level now that it's also now known that that happens in the last hour of sleep.
Not doing the whole night of sleep.
And that is why setting your alarm and waking up by alarm clock in the morning is not good.
Okay.
Because you don't get that natural last hour.
So how do you get that natural last hour?
You don't watch TV until 12 o'clock at night.
You go to bed early.
Okay.
Now in our lifestyle in medicine, specifically in surgery, this is a difficult thing.
But I mean it has been shown to be so that it's best if you have that natural last hour of sleep.
Okay.
So you're going to have to go through things at least three times before now on the exam.
It's not just pure repetition.
Try and do the retrieval thing and try and get sleep in between.
So don't try and study the one thing, especially when it gets close to the end.
Now you're trying to go through stuff so many times.
There's no return on that investment.
I can tell you now.
There's evidence for that.
Okay.
And then just little actions for, you know, what you've got to do from here on in.
Let's just develop little habits.
As I said, think back to when it was successful for you or past your primary.
Before that, obviously, as I said, you did well at school.
Something happened there for you to be successful at this memory game, you know.
So, you know, try and stick to those, but do this habitually.
Because this whole thing is dependent upon small little steps, you know.
Don't get to a stage where this whole thing becomes too overwhelming and you feel like,
oh, you haven't got enough time left.
Then you've got to postpone and write the next time and don't fall into the same,
you know, make the same mistake.
You've got a long time now from now to the exam.
Do a little bit every day.
You know, you've got to do some work here.
Okay.
And you don't have to do three hours a day.
If you do a little bit each day, suddenly you look back and say,
gee, look what I've been through.
You know, you've done a hell of a lot.
Okay, but that is some habitage form and some ritual that you have
that you just do at least a little bit every day.
Don't let a day go by that you haven't done anything.
And it doesn't mean, oh, well, it's too late in the day
and I have to put in at least three hours, therefore I will do nothing.
You know, if there's ten minutes left then you'd rather do that ten minutes
because you'll feel better after that ten minutes
than you will feel after the doing nothing.
And if you do nothing and nothing and nothing and nothing,
the feel-bad about that nothing and nothing and nothing compounds.
It doesn't just cumulate, it compounds.
And then this whole thing becomes so ridiculous and such a negative experience.
You know, and that, you know, you're not going to get the best out of yourself.
So the whole thing about this is you know, you each have an ability,
you know what that ability is, and just to get that maximum out.
Don't leave lots back in the tank.
Why would you leave some reserve in the tank?
You know, just do the best that you can here.
You know, don't leave something, don't leave unplayed cards on the table.
Just do it all.
Why not try, you know, why not, let's move away from just trying to pass this exam
to see how good can I do, you know, how well can I do.
Let's push this to the max.
Just do it once in your life, even if you don't do it for the final,
just do it for this exam.
Prove to yourself how good you are.
And let's leave this, oh, am I going to pass?
Oh, am I going to fail?
Let's just leave that alone.
It's not going to happen.
Okay.
And you've got to reward yourself.
There's got to be some oxytocin release after,
even if it was just that ten minutes, because that's all you had today.
But hopefully a bigger session in just ten minutes.
But have some release after that.
If you release oxytocin by some form of a happy feeling reward.
Okay.
That means some of these sessions are quite tough, you'll see now.
You're going to walk out, you're not going to feel good,
because I'm not going to be, I'm not here to make you feel good after this.
I'm really going to, you know, I push it.
You know, and then you've got to do something when you walk out of here,
we'll do some joke or we'll go do something or you'll go do something.
You know, something you've got to have that bit of release or reward for that.
And then, again, lastly, make me proud, first of all,
because my head's on the block and it's been, as I said, you weren't here.
I've been going at this for more or four or three years now.
I mean, those guys that we started with are doing their finals.
There's quite some time and it's been successful,
so you're not going to let me down, number one.
Secondly, don't let yourself down.
Okay, it's actually the other way around.
Don't let yourself down.
As I said, don't leave cards on the table.
You know, why do you want to do a half-past attempt at this thing?
Whatever form.
Then there's something wrong here.
You know, and you're still young and you still enjoy surgery.
Grab it by both hands, you know, and see how much you can get into your head.
It's not about getting into your head and using it in an exam.
It's actually, it's nice, it's empowering to have knowledge.
It's empowering to be faced with a problem or do ward rounds
and the consultant asks something or something,
and you actually know it as opposed to standing there,
making a little joke, smiling, you know,
trying to get the attention off of you.
That's ridiculous.
You know, why must it be like that?
I'd rather know the answer.
It's enjoyable to know the answer.
There's an enjoyment to knowing stuff.
It's empowering to know stuff.
It makes you feel good.
Okay.
So, study in that light.
Not for this old-fashioned exam that you have to go through.
Unfortunately, you have to go through it.
So, but let it be a side effect of, you know,
a little side issue of the rest.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Await.
I'll do this.
Thank you one bit.
So, let me now have to go through one 2-round bit of a minute now,
so...
This is the informational visual cues.
All right.
Do you know, let me do something.
Wow.
Okay.
Okay.
It's great.
My smile.
One way is to use the data guide.
So, the technology is being able to look at these platforms.
