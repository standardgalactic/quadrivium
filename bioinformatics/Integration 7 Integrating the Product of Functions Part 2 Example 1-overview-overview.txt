The text explains how to find the indefinite integral of \( x \cdot \sin(x) \) using integration by parts. The method is based on the formula:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

To solve the integral, two choices for \( u \) and \( dv \) are considered:

1. **First Choice**:
   - Choose \( u = x \), so \( du = dx \).
   - Choose \( dv = \sin(x) \, dx \), giving \( v = -\cos(x) \).

Substitute into the formula:

\[
\int x \sin(x) \, dx = x(-\cos(x)) - \int (-\cos(x)) \cdot 1 \, dx
\]

Simplify to:

\[
= -x \cos(x) + \int \cos(x) \, dx
\]

The antiderivative of \( \cos(x) \) is \( \sin(x) \), resulting in:

\[
= -x \cos(x) + \sin(x) + C
\]

where \( C \) is the constant of integration. This choice provides a straightforward solution.

2. **Alternative Choice**:
   - Choose \( u = \sin(x) \), so \( du = \cos(x) \, dx \).
   - Choose \( dv = x \, dx \), giving \( v = \frac{1}{2}x^2 \).

Substitute into the formula:

\[
\int x \sin(x) \, dx = \sin(x) \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2\right) - \int \frac{1}{2}x^2 \cos(x) \, dx
\]

This results in a more complicated integral and is less efficient.

The preferred solution from the first choice is:

\[
\int x \sin(x) \, dx = -x \cos(x) + \sin(x) + C
\]
