The text explains how to express the equations of planes using the point-normal form and determines if planes are parallel by comparing their normal vectors. Here's a summary:

### Point-Normal Form Overview:
- **Definition**: The equation of a plane is expressed with a normal vector and a specific point on the plane, leveraging the property that the dot product of the normal vector and any vector lying in the plane equals zero.
  
### Examples:
1. **Example 1**:
   - Given Normal Vector: \(\mathbf{N} = (-2, 1, -1)\)
   - Point on Plane: \(P_0 = (X_0, Y_0, Z_0)\)
   - Equation: \((-2)(X - X_0) + 1(Y - Y_0) - 1(Z - Z_0) = 0\)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Plane Equation: \(3X + 7Y + 2Z = 10\)
   - Normal Vector: \(\mathbf{N} = (-3, 7, 2)\)
   - Point on Plane: Setting \(X = 0\) and \(Y = 0\), \(Z = 5\); hence \(P_0 = (0, 0, 5)\).
   - Equation: \((-3)(X) + 7(Y) + 2(Z - 5) = 0\)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Plane Equation: \(X - 4Z = 0\) implies \(Y = 0\)
   - Normal Vector: \(\mathbf{N} = (1, 0, -4)\)
   - Point on Plane: \(P_0 = (0, 0, 0)\)
   - Equation: \(X - 4Z = 0\)

### Key Points:
- The point-normal form utilizes a normal vector and a specific point on the plane.
- Multiple equivalent forms can be derived by choosing different points on the same plane.

### Parallel Planes:
- To determine if two planes are parallel, compare their normal vectors. If they are scalar multiples of each other, the planes are parallel but not necessarily coincident.

### Application Example:
- Given Plane Equations:
  1. \(8X - 2Y - 4Z + 5 = 0\)
  2. \(X - \frac{1}{4}Y - \frac{1}{2}Z = 0\)

- Normal Vector for First Plane: \((8, -2, -4)\)
- Transform Second Equation by multiplying by 8 to match the first plane's form: \(8X - 2Y - 4Z = 0\)
- Normal Vectors are Proportional (\(N1 = 8 \times N2\)), indicating parallel planes.
- The additional constant in the first equation indicates they are not coincident but merely parallel at different positions.

The text concludes that these two specific planes are parallel, meaning they do not intersect and maintain a constant distance apart.
