The text provides a summary of specific derivatives for various functions, emphasizing their forms without delving into proofs. Key points include:

1. **Exponential Functions**: For \( f(x) = a^x \), where \( a \) is a constant, the derivative is \( a^x \ln(a) \). This form applies to non-polynomial transcendental functions.

2. **Natural Exponential Function**: The derivative of \( e^x \) is simply \( e^x \).

3. **Logarithmic Functions**: For the natural logarithm \( \ln(x) \), the derivative is \( \frac{1}{x} \).

4. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - The derivative of \( \sin(x) \) is \( \cos(x) \).
   - The derivative of \( \cos(x) \) is \( -\sin(x) \).

5. **Sum/Difference Rule**: When differentiating the sum or difference of two functions, the derivative is obtained by differentiating each function individually and then adding or subtracting the results.

These rules are crucial for analyzing rates of change in various contexts, such as growth trends in organisms or other phenomena.

The text provides a summary of key derivative formulas for specific types of functions:

1. **Exponential Functions**: For \( f(x) = a^x \), where \( a \) is a constant, the derivative is \( a^x \cdot \ln(a) \).

2. **Natural Exponential Function**: The derivative of \( e^x \) (where \( e \) is Euler's number) is \( e^x \).

3. **Logarithmic Functions**: For \( f(x) = \ln(x) \), the derivative is \( \frac{1}{x} \).

4. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - The derivative of \( \sin(x) \) is \( \cos(x) \).
   - The derivative of \( \cos(x) \) is \( -\sin(x) \).

5. **Sum and Difference Rules**: When differentiating the sum or difference of two functions, simply take the derivative of each function separately and then add or subtract them accordingly.

These rules are crucial for calculating rates of change in various contexts, such as growth trends in organisms. The text emphasizes remembering these formulas rather than proving them.
