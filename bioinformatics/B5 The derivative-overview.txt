The text provides a summary of specific derivatives for various functions, emphasizing their forms without delving into proofs. Key points include:

1. **Exponential Functions**: For \( f(x) = a^x \), where \( a \) is a constant, the derivative is \( a^x \ln(a) \). This form applies to non-polynomial transcendental functions.

2. **Natural Exponential Function**: The derivative of \( e^x \) is simply \( e^x \).

3. **Logarithmic Functions**: For the natural logarithm \( \ln(x) \), the derivative is \( \frac{1}{x} \).

4. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - The derivative of \( \sin(x) \) is \( \cos(x) \).
   - The derivative of \( \cos(x) \) is \( -\sin(x) \).

5. **Sum/Difference Rule**: When differentiating the sum or difference of two functions, the derivative is obtained by differentiating each function individually and then adding or subtracting the results.

These rules are crucial for analyzing rates of change in various contexts, such as growth trends in organisms or other phenomena.
