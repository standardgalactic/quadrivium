The text explains how to solve an equation where the unknown variable is in the exponent using logarithms, specifically focusing on a problem involving Euler's number (e). The given equation is \(16e^{0.05t} = 32\). To isolate the variable \(t\), the equation is first simplified by dividing both sides by 16, resulting in \(e^{0.05t} = 2\).

Next, natural logarithms are applied to both sides of the equation to make use of the property that allows exponents to be brought down as coefficients: \(\ln(e^{0.05t}) = \ln(2)\). Using the power rule of logarithms, this becomes \(0.05t \cdot \ln(e) = \ln(2)\).

Since the natural log of \(e\) is 1 (\(\ln(e) = 1\)), the equation simplifies to \(0.05t = \ln(2)\). Solving for \(t\) involves multiplying both sides by 20, yielding the solution: \(t = 20 \cdot \ln(2)\).
