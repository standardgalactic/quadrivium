The text is a step-by-step tutorial on how to import and display images in Google Colab, which is an online environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks. Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Setup**: The author opens a new Colab notebook from their Google Drive, where they store YouTube tutorials.

2. **Initial Steps**:
   - Rename the notebook to "Display Images."
   - Import necessary Python libraries: `files` from `google.colab` for file handling and `image` from `IPython.display` for image display.

3. **Uploading an Image**:
   - Create a variable called `uploaded` using `files.upload()`, which opens the browser to choose a file.
   - Select an image (e.g., "krg logo light.png") to upload, which will show progress and confirm once complete.

4. **Displaying the Image**:
   - Use the uploaded file's name as it appears in Colab to display it using `display.Image`.
   - Specify additional parameters such as setting a width for better visibility.
   - Run the cell to view the image in the notebook.

The tutorial concludes by successfully displaying the chosen logo in the notebook. The repeated phrases like "I super" and "I'm" are likely filler or mistakes, not essential to the steps outlined.
