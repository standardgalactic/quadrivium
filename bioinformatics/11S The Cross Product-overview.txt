Let's break down your discussion into clear mathematical steps:

### Vector Calculations

1. **Vector Operations:**
   - You have a series of vectors and their operations which seem to involve cross products or dot products.
   - The result you mentioned, \(\sqrt{26}/2\), is the area of a triangle formed by vectors in 3D space.

2. **Summarizing the Triangle Area Calculation:**
   - If you have vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), the area \(A\) of the parallelogram they form is given by:
     \[
     A = \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|
     \]
   - The area of the triangle is half of this:
     \[
     \text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|
     \]

3. **Given Calculation:**
   - You calculated the area as \(\sqrt{26}/2\), which implies:
     \[
     \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{26}
     \]

### Height Calculation

1. **Height from a Point to a Line:**
   - To find the height \(h\) from point \(C\) to line \(AB\), use:
     \[
     h = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}
     \]
   - Where \(\mathbf{a}\) is the vector from \(A\) to \(C\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the vector from \(A\) to \(B\).

2. **Given Vectors:**
   - You have \(\mathbf{b} = (-1, 2, 2)\).
   - Calculate its norm:
     \[
     \|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
     \]

3. **Height Calculation:**
   - Using the area calculation:
     \[
     h = \frac{\sqrt{26}}{3}
     \]

### Conclusion

- The key takeaway is that regardless of which vectors you use to define the triangle, as long as they describe the same geometric shape, their cross product magnitude will yield the same area.
- This consistency allows you to calculate the height from a vertex to the opposite side using the formula for the height derived from the area and base length.

This approach ensures that your calculations remain consistent and accurate when transitioning between different representations of the same geometric figure.
