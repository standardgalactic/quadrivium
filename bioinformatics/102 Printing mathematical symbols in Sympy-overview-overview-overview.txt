The lecture discusses utilizing the SymPy library in an IPython notebook to enhance the "pretty printing" of mathematical symbols. Key points include:

1. **Setup**: Enable pretty printing by importing SymPy and using `sympy.init_printing()`, which modifies how outputs are displayed within the notebook.

2. **Symbols Definition**: Define symbols, including Greek letters or other names from SymPy (e.g., \( \theta \) for theta), making manipulation and display straightforward.

3. **Expression Display**:
   - Simple expressions like \( \theta^3 \) are beautifully rendered.
   - Complex algebraic expressions can be factorized neatly, e.g., displaying \( 2x^2 + xy \) as \( x(2x + y) \).

4. **Integration**:
   - Indefinite integrals (e.g., \(\int x^3 \, dx\)) are printed clearly.
   - Definite integrals from \( a \) to \( b \) can be displayed and computed using `sympy.integrate()`, providing symbolic integration.

5. **Differentiation**:
   - Derivatives, such as the third derivative of \( x + y^3 \) with respect to \( y \), are calculated and formatted elegantly.
   - Both explicit notation (e.g., repeating 'y' for a third derivative) and shorthand methods (`doit()`) are shown.

6. **Special Symbols**: Greek letters and other special characters can be easily mapped to symbols in SymPy, improving the clarity of mathematical notation when printed.

The lecture emphasizes using SymPy's capabilities to enhance readability and presentation of mathematical computations in an IPython notebook.
