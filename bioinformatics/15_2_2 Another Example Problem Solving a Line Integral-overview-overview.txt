The text describes the process of evaluating a line integral over a curve parameterized by \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (5\cos(t), 5\sin(t)) \) for \( t \) ranging from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). The function being integrated is \( f(x, y) = 2xy \).

1. **Parametrization and Norm Calculation**:
   - The curve is parameterized as \( x(t) = 5\cos(t) \) and \( y(t) = 5\sin(t) \).
   - The derivative of the parametrization is \( \mathbf{r}'(t) = (-5\sin(t), 5\cos(t)) \).
   - The norm of this derivative is \( \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = 5 \).
   - Therefore, the differential arc length is \( ds = 5 \, dt \).

2. **Function Substitution**:
   - Substitute into \( f(x, y) = 2xy \):
     \[
     f(5\cos(t), 5\sin(t)) = 50\cos(t)\sin(t)
     \]

3. **Integral Setup**:
   - The line integral is set up as:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{\pi/4} 250\cos(t)\sin(t) \, dt
     \]

4. **Solving the Integral**:
   - Use substitution: let \( u = \sin(t) \), then \( du = \cos(t) \, dt \).
   - Change limits: from \( t = 0 \) to \( u = 0 \); and from \( t = \frac{\pi}{4} \) to \( u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
   - The integral becomes:
     \[
     250 \int_{0}^{1/\sqrt{2}} u \, du
     \]
   - Evaluate the integral:
     \[
     250 \left[ \frac{u^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{1/\sqrt{2}} = 62.5
     \]

The value of the line integral is \( 62.5 \).
