Matrix multiplication differs from scalar multiplication and requires adherence to specific rules:

1. **Compatibility Rule**: Two matrices can be multiplied only if the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix. If this condition isn't met, multiplication is not possible.

2. **Size of Resultant Matrix**: When two matrices are compatible for multiplication, the resultant matrix's dimensions are determined by the number of rows from the first matrix and the number of columns from the second matrix. The "middle" dimensions used to check compatibility are disregarded in determining the size of the result.

3. **Multiplication Process**:
   - To find an element at a specific position (e.g., row 1, column 1) in the resultant matrix, take the corresponding row from the first matrix and the corresponding column from the second matrix.
   - Multiply each pair of elements from these selected row and column together.
   - Sum all these products to obtain the value for that element in the resultant matrix.

The text illustrates this process with an example using matrices A (2x2) and B (2x4), showing how to compute each element of the resulting 2x4 matrix. For instance, the first element is calculated by multiplying elements from the first row of A with those in the first column of B: \( (2 \times 1) + (3 \times 4) = 14 \). The text encourages practicing this method to find other elements independently.
