Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder identified in 1835 by Robert Graves. It primarily causes hyperthyroidism, characterized by symptoms such as an enlarged thyroid gland, ophthalmopathy (eye problems), and dermopathy (skin issues). However, not all patients exhibit these signs. Typically diagnosed between ages 20 to 40, it disproportionately affects women.

The disease stems from a loss of self-tolerance to thyroid antigens, particularly the TSH receptor. The antibodies involved can stimulate or inhibit thyroid activity, leading to both hyperthyroidism and, at times, episodes of hypothyroidism in patients.

Research has shown that orbital pre-adipocyte fibroblasts, which express TSH receptors, are affected by these antibodies. Most insights into the disease's pathogenesis come from animal studies, primarily using mice injected with TSH receptor antigens to mimic symptoms. While early models were not perfect analogs for human disease, advancements like gene delivery methods and engineered mouse models have improved our understanding.

Current research focuses on simulating chronic thyroid stimulation through techniques such as T-cell depletion followed by adenoviral vector immunization, aiming to closely replicate the human condition. This ongoing research helps elucidate the complex manifestations of Graves' disease. The next video will explore its clinical symptoms and signs.
