Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder identified in 1835 by Robert Graves. It primarily causes hyperthyroidism, characterized by symptoms such as an enlarged thyroid gland, ophthalmopathy (eye problems), and dermopathy (skin issues). However, not all patients exhibit these signs. Typically diagnosed between ages 20 to 40, it disproportionately affects women.

The disease stems from a loss of self-tolerance to thyroid antigens, particularly the TSH receptor. The antibodies involved can stimulate or inhibit thyroid activity, leading to both hyperthyroidism and, at times, episodes of hypothyroidism in patients.

Research has shown that orbital pre-adipocyte fibroblasts, which express TSH receptors, are affected by these antibodies. Most insights into the disease's pathogenesis come from animal studies, primarily using mice injected with TSH receptor antigens to mimic symptoms. While early models were not perfect analogs for human disease, advancements like gene delivery methods and engineered mouse models have improved our understanding.

Current research focuses on simulating chronic thyroid stimulation through techniques such as T-cell depletion followed by adenoviral vector immunization, aiming to closely replicate the human condition. This ongoing research helps elucidate the complex manifestations of Graves' disease. The next video will explore its clinical symptoms and signs.

Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder identified in 1835 by Graves, characterized primarily by hyperthyroidism. It can also lead to an enlarged thyroid, infiltrative ophthalmopathy (eye problems), and demopathy (skin conditions). Not all patients experience every symptom, but most are diagnosed between ages 20 and 40, with a higher prevalence among women.

The disease stems from a loss of self-tolerance to thyroid antigens, particularly the TSH receptor. The antibodies involved can stimulate or inhibit the thyroid, explaining why some patients may have episodes of hypothyroidism despite having Graves' disease. Orbital pre-adipocyte fibroblasts expressing TSH receptors are susceptible to these antibodies.

Most insights into the pathogenesis come from animal studies. For years, mice injected with TSH receptor antigens developed symptoms similar to humans, including thyroid growth and hormone overproduction. However, these models do not fully replicate human disease. Advances include gene delivery methods using plasmid C-DNA or adenovirus vectors and engineering mice to more closely mimic human conditions.

Modern approaches involve the passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies for chronic thyroid stimulation and T-cell depletion followed by adenoviral vector immunization. These efforts aim to better understand the complex effects of Graves' disease. The next video will explore its clinical symptoms and signs.
