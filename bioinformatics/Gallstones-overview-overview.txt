Jean is a surgeon who focuses on urgent surgical conditions like gallstones, which form from bile in the gallbladder. There are three types of gallstones: cholesterol stones (75% of cases), black pigment stones (25%), and brown pigment stones (5%). Gallstones affect about 9% of women and 6% of men globally.

Risk factors for developing gallstones include being over 50, female gender, genetics, pregnancy, certain medical conditions like diabetes in women, obesity, rapid weight loss, and hormone replacement therapy. There is no direct link between high cholesterol levels and gallstones.

Preventive measures suggested by Jean are taking vitamin C, consuming polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats (found in nuts), drinking coffee, following a vegan diet with plant protein, and maintaining regular physical activity. He encourages viewers to subscribe for more informative videos.
