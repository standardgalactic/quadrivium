The text provides a step-by-step guide for solving a third-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The key steps include:

1. **Identify the Differential Equation**: Recognize it's a third-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.

2. **Formulate the Auxiliary Equation**: This involves setting up an algebraic equation (auxiliary equation) based on the given differential equation, which in this case is \( m^3 + 3m^2 - 4 = 0 \).

3. **Find the Roots of the Polynomial**:
   - Identify one root by inspection; substituting \( m = 1 \) yields zero, indicating it's a root.
   - Perform polynomial long division to factor out \( (m-1) \), simplifying the equation to \( m^2 + 4m + 4 = 0 \).
   - Further factor this quadratic as \( (m+2)^2 = 0 \).

4. **Identify All Roots**: The roots are \( m_1 = 1 \), and a repeated root \( m_2 = m_3 = -2 \).

5. **Construct the General Solution**:
   - Use the roots to form solutions of the differential equation.
   - For \( m_1 = 1 \), the solution is \( c_1 e^x \).
   - For the repeated root \( m_2 = m_3 = -2 \), the solutions are \( c_2 e^{-2x} \) and \( c_3 x e^{-2x} \).

6. **Combine Solutions**: The general solution is a linear combination of these individual solutions: 
   \[
   y(x) = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-2x} + c_3 x e^{-2x}
   \]

The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing patterns in polynomial equations and using techniques like long division to simplify them, as well as understanding how to construct solutions based on the roots found.

The text provides a step-by-step approach to solving a third-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The differential equation is given as \( y''' + 3y'' - 4y = 0 \), which translates into the auxiliary (characteristic) polynomial: \( m^3 + 3m^2 - 4 = 0 \). Note that there's no \( m \) term, reflecting the absence of a first derivative in the original equation.

2. **Finding Roots**: 
   - Start by identifying an obvious root through inspection. Substituting \( m = 1 \) satisfies the equation: \( 1^3 + 3(1)^2 - 4 = 0 \). Thus, \( m = 1 \) is a root.
   - Use polynomial long division to divide \( m^3 + 3m^2 - 4 \) by \( m - 1 \), resulting in the quotient \( m^2 + 4m + 4 \).

3. **Further Factorization**:
   - The quadratic \( m^2 + 4m + 4 \) can be factored as \( (m + 2)^2 \).
   - This gives roots \( m = -2 \) with multiplicity two.

4. **General Solution Construction**:
   - For the root \( m = 1 \), the solution is \( c_1 e^x \).
   - For the repeated root \( m = -2 \), the solutions are \( c_2 e^{-2x} \) and \( c_3 xe^{-2x} \).

5. **Complete Solution**:
   - Combine these to form the general solution: 
     \[
     y(x) = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-2x} + c_3 xe^{-2x}
     \]
   - The constants \( c_1, c_2, \) and \( c_3 \) are determined by initial conditions or boundary values.

This method illustrates the process of solving higher-order linear differential equations using characteristic polynomials and recognizing patterns in roots for constructing solutions.
