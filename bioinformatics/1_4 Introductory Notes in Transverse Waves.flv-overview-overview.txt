The text explains how longitudinal waves can be analyzed using concepts from transverse wave behavior through examples involving metal bars and pipes. 

### Metal Bar Examples:
1. **40 cm Metal Bar**: 
   - When dropped, a wave travels at 5,500 m/s.
   - The fundamental frequency is determined by setting up a standing wave with a node in the middle, making the bar's length equivalent to half a wavelength (80 cm). Thus, the fundamental frequency \( f \) is calculated using \( f = \frac{v}{\lambda} \).

2. **2-meter Clamped Metal Bar**:
   - Clamped at 50 cm and struck, it resonates at 3 kHz.
   - The clamping point acts as a node with free ends as antinodes. 
   - With four quarter wavelengths fitting between the fixed points (1.5 meters), one full wavelength equals the bar's total length (2 meters).
   - Wave speed \( v \) is calculated using \( v = f \cdot \lambda \).

These examples illustrate how wave patterns and boundary conditions help analyze longitudinal waves by comparing them to transverse waves in resonant systems.

### Pipe Examples:
- **Fundamental Frequency**:
  - In a closed-open pipe, the fundamental frequency involves a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end, fitting a quarter wavelength (\(\lambda/4\)) in its length \(L_1\).
  - For an open-open or open-closed pipe, it corresponds to half a wavelength (\(\lambda/2\)) fitting within its length \(L_2\).

- **Wavelength and Length Relationship**:
  - Both pipes have the same sound wave velocity under identical conditions.
  - For closed-open: \[ L_1 = \frac{\lambda}{4} \]
  - For open-ended: \[ L_2 = \frac{\lambda}{2} \]

- **Equating Frequencies**:
  - To achieve the same fundamental frequency (\(f_1 = f_2\)), equate their wavelength expressions.
  - Solving \( 4L_1 = 2L_2 \) gives: 
    \[ L_2 = 2L_1 \]

Thus, for both pipes to have identical fundamental frequencies, the open-ended pipe must be twice as long as the closed-open one. The text emphasizes understanding these relationships through diagrams of nodes and antinodes in different configurations.
