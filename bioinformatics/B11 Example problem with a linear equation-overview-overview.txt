The text outlines solving an initial value problem for a first-order linear differential equation \( y' + y = x \) with the initial condition \( y(0) = 4 \). The solution involves using an integrating factor, \( e^x \), which transforms the equation into one where the left side is the derivative of \( e^x y \). After integration by parts on the right side, we find:

\[ e^x y = x e^x - e^x + C_1. \]

Solving for \( y \) gives a general solution:

\[ y = x - 1 + \frac{C_1}{e^x}. \]

Applying the initial condition \( y(0) = 4 \), we find \( C_1 = 5 \). Thus, the specific solution to the problem is:

\[ y = x - 1 + \frac{5}{e^x}. \] 

This function satisfies both the differential equation and the given initial condition.
