The text explains how to form a right coset in group theory using permutations within the symmetric group \( S_4 \). Here's a concise summary:

1. **Context**: The focus is on forming a right coset \( HA \) where \( H \) is a subgroup of \( S_4 \), and \( A \) is an element (permutation) from \( S_4 \).

2. **Elements of \( H \)**: 
   - Identity permutation: leaves elements unchanged.
   - Transpositions: \( (1, 2) \) swaps 1 and 2; \( (3, 4) \) swaps 3 and 4.
   - Composition: \( (1, 2)(3, 4) \), combining the two transpositions.

3. **Element \( A \)**:
   - Permutation \( (1, 4, 3, 2) \): maps 1 to 4, 4 to 3, 3 to 2, and 2 to 1.

4. **Forming Right Coset \( HA \)**:
   - Each element of \( H \) is composed with \( A \), applying \( A \) first (right) followed by elements from \( H \).

5. **Examples**:
   - Identity composition results in \( A \).
   - Other compositions are calculated to show transformations.

6. **Result**: The right coset \( HA \) consists of permutations derived from these compositions.

The text encourages practicing this process with the same subgroup \( H \) and permutation \( A \) to reinforce understanding.
