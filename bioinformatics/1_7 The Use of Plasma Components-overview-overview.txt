The text provides an overview of two important plasma components used in medical treatments: Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Cryoprecipitate.

### Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)
- **Production**: FFP is derived from whole blood, frozen at -18 to -30°C within 8 hours. It contains all coagulation factors and other proteins.
- **Storage & Usage**: Usable for one year; typically around 250 ml per unit, slightly diluted by a citrate anticoagulant.
- **Indications**:
  - Used for hemostasis when coagulation factor activity is below 25%, provided there are no inhibitors like heparin and fibrinogen levels are adequate.
  - Treats inherited factor deficiencies (e.g., factors XI or V in severe DIC), multiple coagulation factor deficiencies, warfarin overdose, vitamin K deficiency, liver failure, and dilutional coagulopathy from massive transfusions.
- **Contraindications**: Not suitable for primary therapy of specific defects such as hemophilia, correcting INRs <2, volume expansion, or as a nutrient source.
- **Side Effects**: Includes immune reactions (ABO compatibility required), disease transmission risk, volume overload, febrile and anaphylactic reactions, and transfusion-related acute lung injury.

### Cryoprecipitate
- **Production**: Obtained by thawing FFP at about 4°C; the precipitate is then centrifuged out.
- **Components**: Contains Factor VIII, fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor. One unit of FFP yields 10-20 ml of cryoprecipitate, which contains approximately 200 mg of fibrinogen and 100 units of Factor VIII.
- **Indications**:
  - Treats deficiencies in factors present within it (excluding vitamin K-dependent factors).
  - Useful for congenital or acquired fibrinogen and Factor XIII deficiencies.
  - Beneficial for trauma patients with consumptive coagulopathy, where fibrinogen levels are low despite adequate Factor activity (25-30%), leading to ineffective clotting.
  - Crucial for managing von Willebrandt’s disease when no other sources of von Willebrandt factor are available and in urgent situations like uremic bleeds.
- **Risks**: Similar to those associated with FFP.

The text highlights the need for careful use of these plasma components based on specific medical requirements.
