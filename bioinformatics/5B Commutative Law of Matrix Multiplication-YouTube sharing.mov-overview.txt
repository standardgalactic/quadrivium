The text provides an overview of the commutative law of multiplication as it applies to matrices, highlighting that matrix multiplication is generally non-commutative. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Non-Commutativity Example**: When multiplying two matrices A (2x3) and B (3x4), the product AB results in a 2x4 matrix. However, BA is not defined because the number of columns in B (4) does not match the number of rows in A (2).

2. **Different Sizes Example**: With matrices A (2x3) and B (3x2), both products AB and BA are defined but result in different sizes: AB is a 2x2 matrix, while BA is a 3x3 matrix.

3. **Same Size, Different Values Example**: For square matrices A and B of size 2x2, both AB and BA are defined and have the same dimensions (2x2). However, their values may differ, demonstrating that even when sizes match, the products can still be unequal.

Overall, the text illustrates that matrix multiplication does not generally satisfy the commutative property: \(AB \neq BA\).

The text discusses the commutative law of multiplication in the context of matrix multiplication, emphasizing that it does not hold for matrices. Three examples illustrate this:

1. **Example 1**: A \(2 \times 3\) matrix multiplied by a \(3 \times 4\) matrix results in a \(2 \times 4\) matrix (AB). However, the reverse order (BA) is undefined because a \(3 \times 4\) matrix cannot be multiplied by a \(2 \times 3\) matrix.

2. **Example 2**: A \(2 \times 3\) matrix and a \(3 \times 2\) matrix can both be multiplied in either order (AB or BA), but the resulting matrices are of different sizes: AB is \(2 \times 2\), while BA is \(3 \times 3\).

3. **Example 3**: Two \(2 \times 2\) matrices, when multiplied in either order (AB or BA), result in matrices of the same size (\(2 \times 2\)). However, their elements are different, demonstrating that AB and BA are not equal even though they have the same dimensions.

Overall, matrix multiplication is not commutative: \(AB \neq BA\) in general.
