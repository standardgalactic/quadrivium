The text provides an overview of the commutative law of multiplication as it applies to matrices, highlighting that matrix multiplication is generally non-commutative. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Non-Commutativity Example**: When multiplying two matrices A (2x3) and B (3x4), the product AB results in a 2x4 matrix. However, BA is not defined because the number of columns in B (4) does not match the number of rows in A (2).

2. **Different Sizes Example**: With matrices A (2x3) and B (3x2), both products AB and BA are defined but result in different sizes: AB is a 2x2 matrix, while BA is a 3x3 matrix.

3. **Same Size, Different Values Example**: For square matrices A and B of size 2x2, both AB and BA are defined and have the same dimensions (2x2). However, their values may differ, demonstrating that even when sizes match, the products can still be unequal.

Overall, the text illustrates that matrix multiplication does not generally satisfy the commutative property: \(AB \neq BA\).
