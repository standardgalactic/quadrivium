Almost 1 in 10 patients with hyperthyroidism in pregnancy will develop the endocrine emergency
known as thyroid storm.
These patients can be known with Graves disease or some present de novo.
The diagnosis is suspected when a pregnant patient presents with a combination of fever,
a change in her mental state, seizures, nausea, diarrhea and cardiac arrhythmias.
There is usually a precipitating factor such as surgery or labor and delivery, but most
commonly an infection, which must always be sought.
If left unmanaged, cardiogenic failure, shock and coma will ensue.
These patients should be managed immediately, even while waiting for the laboratory results.
Measures include supportive therapies such as supplemental oxygen, IV fluid resuscitation
and electrolyte replacement.
Antibiotics should be given immediately and an obstetrician should evaluate the fetus.
Product therapies include the use of thionamides in combination with IV beta blockers such
as esmolol as well as dexamethasone.
Benzodiazepines can be used to reduce severe agitation.
As mentioned before, an active search for underlying infection should be considered.
