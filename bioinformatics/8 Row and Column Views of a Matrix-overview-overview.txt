The text explains two perspectives for understanding linear equations: the row view and the column view, along with a brief mention of an algebraic approach. 

1. **Row View**: 
   - This method involves visualizing each equation as a line on a 2D coordinate plane. For example, given \(x + 2y = 8\) and \(3x - y = 3\), these equations are plotted as lines. The solution to the system is at their intersection point, \((x, y) = (2, 3)\).

2. **Column View**: 
   - This perspective uses matrices. Coefficients form a coefficient matrix, and the variables and constants form vectors. For \(x + 2y = 8\) and \(3x - y = 3\), you create the coefficient matrix \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\), variable vector \(\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}\), and constant vector \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}\).
   - The system is expressed as a matrix equation \(A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}\). The solution involves finding \(\mathbf{x}\) by multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient matrix if it exists: \(\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\mathbf{b}\).

The text also mentions an algebraic approach, which directly manipulates the matrix. The column view is emphasized for its utility in solving systems using inverses when applicable. Additionally, graphical representation of vectors (column view) shows how multiples of coefficient vectors combine to form the result vector, aligning with solutions found graphically and algebraically.
