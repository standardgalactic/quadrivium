Hi there, so this is a quite interesting video and I think it's very topical. At the moment of
course we get all these results from vaccine trials and when you read these trials you'll see
a lot of them expresses the efficacy of the vaccine. Now in order for us to determine efficacy
we look at the relative risk. So this video I'm going to show you a notebook, two notebooks in
actual fact. I'm going to use R just to explain the R language for statistical computing just
what relative risk is and how we then use it to calculate efficacy and we're also going to look
at a specific trial. In South Africa there was a small trial as far as the AstraZeneca vaccine was
concerned and it showed very poor efficacy and because of that the vaccine was withdrawn from
South Africa which of course is a very big decision was the first vaccine it was supposed to go to
healthcare workers such as myself and the vaccine was withdrawn because of the poor showing. So we
I'm going to show you how they got to this very bad efficacy level of only 21 percent and of course
it's not only about that it's about this the confidence intervals around that efficacy and
that's what I want to explain. Now of course withdrawing that was a very difficult decision
and it wasn't only the clinical data there was some data as well and I'll talk a little bit about it
about the neutralizing antibodies etc. A lot more went into the the decision not use the AstraZeneca vaccine
in South Africa. So it's all about relative risk and in this video I'll show you just how
how a relative risk works how you can calculate it and how from that we get the efficacy. So here
we are on my ArtPubs website you can view all the documents that I upload you can view them here and
of course the original the RMD files are available on github and the links to all of these things will
be in the description down below. So we're just going to look at uncertainty in relative risk. First
what is risk what is relative risk and how do we express uncertainty in that and of course it's very
topical with the vaccines these days in the pandemic and we express the efficacy of these
vaccines. I want to show you just just how to do that. So in this first notebook we're just going to
talk about what risk is and what relative risk is and then what efficacy is and then how can we express
uncertainty just due to randomness. We do one trial but there is a lot of other trials that if
if we could do it we could do it over and over and over again and this one trial that we have is just
one of the possible outcomes and we need to look at where the actual efficacy lies and it'll be in
some range that we can simulate around this one this one study that we've done. So let's first have a look
at what risk is and you see there in equation one it's just the number of positive outcomes divided by
the total in the group. Now we've got to talk about what a positive outcome is and we say positive outcome
but it doesn't sentimentally have to be positive the outcome can be quite negative and in this instance
it might be well develop the disease and certainly that's not positive but we just use this term
that's the positive outcome the outcome that we are interested in in investigating. So if we have
a bunch of participants in a study a certain number of them will develop this positive outcome the outcome
that we're interested in as I said which might be quite a negative thing but if we just take that ratio
that fraction the number of positive outcomes divided by the total number in the group that is the risk.
Now if we've got two groups one group for instance received a placebo intervention and one group received
a treatment intervention we can just look at this difference in the risk between the two. So we'll
calculate risk as per equation one for both of them and we just take the difference so the risk in the
control minus the risk in the treatment and what we're assuming here is that the risk in the treatment will
be lower because the other name for risk difference is absolute risk reduction ARR absolute risk reduction
that's just the difference in the risk and that's a very good way to express a difference in risk
between a control group receiving the placebo and the treatment group getting this active intervention.
So just that difference you've just got to just watch out if the risk in the treatment ends up being higher
than the risk in the control. Of course then we cannot talk about absolute risk reduction or we still
can talk about absolute risk reduction we just got to say that being in the placebo group gives us a
reduction in risk for this positive outcome that we're talking about.
You see there the number needed to treat that is just in equation three there we're not going to
discuss it I've just put that in for you. So what we really want to do is talk about relative risk.
You'll see RR risk ratio relative risk that is the fraction of the risk of the intervention over the
risk of the control so we worked out the risk in both groups very simple calculations the positive
divided by the total the positive divided by the total and for these two we'll just
we'll just take that ratio. Now what we're hoping for you of course is that the risk
the positive outcomes that fraction will be lower in the intervention or the treatment group than in
the control group and if that is so this fraction of course will be less than one and if it's less
than one it means the risk is lowered by being in the intervention or treatment group. So that's when
we express this idea of efficacy. So let's imagine here in this piecewise defined function on the top row here
for efficacy that the risk in the treatment group is lower than the risk in the control group that
it was good to develop this because fewer people fraction wise for the individual groups was lower
if you were in the treatment group than in the control group. That means this relative risk will be
less than one it'll be a fraction of one and what we do is we subtract that relative risk from one so one
minus the relative risk and that gives us the efficacy. Now I've put the second part in here
but we really don't use the second part I just want it's just to to keep your mind or to to simulate
your stimulate your mind a little bit. Imagine that the risk in the treatment was higher then we can't
really talk about efficacy anymore in as much as if this positive outcome was a negative thing and we want
this treatment to lower that risk but now it's going to increase that risk so we just say relative risk
minus one but I warn you there then we can't really talk about efficacy anymore. The efficacy is really
just for that first line one minus the relative risk. So let's look at some coding examples. So we're going
to simulate a study we're taking 41,100 people in our study which is when these vaccine trials were developed
what is the power we need to to see how many people need to be in there so that we reach a
sufficient power to just to to to find this significant difference between the two.
So we say here in our control group there were 20,500 people and in our treatment group there were
20,600 people and we're saying in this trial 350 people in the control group developed the positive
outcome. So this is just thumb suck numbers not from a specific trial and 115 in the treatment group
developed the positive outcome. So in the case of a vaccine we have 350 people in the control group
they just received a placebo they developed the disease and only 115 then in the treatment group
who got the active vaccine developed the positive outcome which is developing the disease. So we're just
saving that also as some computer variables so we've got a underscore control and a underscore treatment
and if we just divide those 350 divided by 115 that's not something that we would express but
just for interest sake then there are three times more positive cases in the control group than the
treatment group. Now there is no denominator in here so if I had lots more people in the placebo group
than in the treatment group that value was going to change so that's not a valid expression really of
what is happening here it's just expressing in this nearly equal groups that we had there were three
three times more positive cases in the control group. What we're interested though is the risk.
So let's see what the risk in the control group is which I'm going to call risk underscore control here.
So that's a that's the control how many got the disease divided by how many was in the control group.
So that's going to be the 350 divided by 20 500 and we see a value of 0.017. Now what you would
commonly see is this multiplied by a thousand so you can say that the risk of developing the disease
would be if we multiply that by a thousand one two three that'll be 17 people per thousand people.
So you'll always see that per thousand per ten thousand per hundred thousand depending on what
makes sense. Now let's do the same for the treatment group so that's the a underscore treatment that's how
many got the disease in the treatment group and divided by how many there were that's just the risk
and we see a much lower risk here of 0.005 so there'll be five and a half people per thousand people
develop the disease what was at risk then of developing the disease and now we're just going
to do the relative risk. So it's the risk of the treatment over the risk of the control
and now we see it's 0.32 multiplied by 100 that's about that's 32.7 percent.
So we want to express efficacy though so we're going to subtract it from one so one minus that one
minus the relative risk and we get the efficacy 67 percent so we can say the efficacy of this
of this vaccine was 67 percent and that is how much it lowered the risk really that is what we're
expressing but as I said before that is just one study we did and if we started a week later we would
have had other people in our study if we could do this over and over again we would get different
results every time so this one result this one efficacy that we found this is one of many
possible ones and what we are interested in is not only this 40 41 100 people in our study
we want to infer these results because it's just a sample on the larger population so what is the true
efficacy in the population as a whole because eventually we want to inoculate everyone
so we need to express a confidence interval around this efficacy and how do we go about that so in
different papers you'll see different methods of doing this there are different equations for doing
this clopper pearson there's some other ways of doing this as well but what we're going to do here
is something that i like to do and that is just to do resampling from the results that we found
and in that way we're going to build up simulate a bunch we're going to do a thousand as if we're
doing our study a thousand times over that gives us a distribution of poor possible efficacies and we
can then calculate a 95 confidence interval now remember what confidence interval means maybe i should
should keep quiet now when we get to confidence intervals when we've calculated the confidence
intervals i'll just remind you exactly what that means so here in r we've created a little function
i'm going to call it simulate underscore group it is a function it takes two parameters n and p
now what we're going to do is create this local variable inside of the function it doesn't exist in the
global space so just internal to our function i'm using the r unif function random uniform
so we're going to draw a random number from a uniform distribution uniform distribution remembers that
every element in the sample space of of this distribution has an equal likelihood of being
chosen at every time we run the experiment so the random uniform is going to draw
from zero to one in that interval on that interval zero to one it just draws a random value
so it will then throw that value back in the bin so that the next time around we do it that number is
it is possible to draw that number again but every value from zero to one has an equal likelihood of
being chosen a uniform distribution it's not bell-shaped that certain values are more likely to be chosen at random it's uniform
and now what we're going to do is we're going to look at this number
that is chosen and we're just going to sum them up if that value is less than p the probability
now that p that we're talking about here is actually the risk remember there were a certain number of
people who got the disease inside of that sample of people and if you think about that that the risk
that is if we do that division the number got positive divided by how many there were that's
in essence of probability this p that we're talking about here in our function the parameter that we've
called p so we're saying we're going to simulate this and we're going to say that random person
we're just simulating this random person they get this random value and if that value is less than
this p p value now i'm not talking about a statistical p value not the famous p value i'm just saying this
risk if that was smaller than that when we're going to start summing them up and that's a simulation
because anyone can get from from zero to one and this value that was chosen there and we only sum them
up we only sum it up when it is less than the numbers that are come out less than this p value
the risk in action in actual fact and what we're going to return is this k
divided by n the n that we supply to the function the sample size so let's let's look at that so
i'm storing p now as in this instance we're going to take the risk in the treatment group so the number
got positive and divided by the total number they were that's our p and now we're going to run a
single simulation so we're just going to say n treatment p and we just run that and now we have
not seeded the cedar random number generator here so every time you run this code you're going to get
a different value but in this instance i got 0.0055 now we're going to use list comprehension and
you'll see earlier in this notebook i just i just loaded this comprehend r package because it contains
this function to vec and it's going to allow us to do list comprehension or in this instance vector
comprehension so i'm just going to simulate this thousand values all in one go so that i just have
this vector of a thousand possible instances i'm going to store that as t so we're just going
to simulate this risk in actual fact over and over and over and over again so sometimes the value is
going to be more than p and it won't be summed and sometimes it's less than p and it will be summed
from what we've done way up there so if we do that we get these thousand values and we can draw
this kernel density estimate plot and it shows us this distribution of risks simulated risks
risks there we go for these thousand times as if we could do the study a thousand times over
and there you see the distribution of risk a lot of them here by 0.05 just over that open of
0.05 three thereabouts four and that was just simulating that over and over again
now one way that we can express this sort of range of values the measures of dispersion would be standard error
and what we've done here is just to take the standard error that's the standard deviation of t in
this instance and we can see it there and because we've got this distribution now we can we can calculate
the from all these values these t values we can calculate these cut-off values so for that i'm
going to use the quantile function and i'm just passing that 1000 values to it and i'm saying calculate
for us these intervals that'll be five percent cut off at the bottom 95 cut off at the top so if you look
at this basically it's going to cut off the bottom five percent and cut off the top five percent and
that gives us a 90 confidence interval then and the values within this thousand values of ours that gave
us that was 0.00475 to 0.0064 so then we're saying a 90 confidence interval around this around this risk
of ours the the the mean risk was going to be these values so you're not necessarily interested in this
single one we want the relative risk so we're going to create another little equation here another
function i should say and it's just going to do what we've done before twice for the control group and
for the treatment group this time so that we can have this efficacy as one minus
relative risk risk two that's going to be the treatment divided by risk one which is going to
be the control so we've got to pass four parameters there so the p value that we are going to ask for
it to count below is the p1 will be the controls risk and the p2 will be the treatment arms risk
and then we just simulate that once and it'll give us back one possible efficacy 65.9 percent now again
using this two vec function i'm going to create this vector of a thousand efficacies all in one go
calling this function of our simulate trial and the simulate trial remember it calls the simulate
underscore group function twice one for each of these two groups of ours and if we plot the kernel
density estimate there we see that we have this range of values possible values we just simulated
so we've resampled based on this finding that we had for this specific study
and then we see the mean efficacy of the 1000 simulator trials was 0.67 our actual one was also
0.67 that's where it's going to work out so if we want a 90 confidence interval for that we just pass
those thousand values to the quantile function and we set a probability cut off the bottom five percent
the top five percent what were the values within t2 which is where we saved the thousand values would be
60.8 to 72.7 so we can say the efficacy of this study for this drug or this vaccine was 67
90 or 90 confidence intervals 60 to 72 or about 61 about 73 so that's 90 confidence intervals and now
let me just remind you what confidence intervals is we're not saying that we are 90 confident that in
the globe as a whole if we gave it to everyone and that we are 90 it's not to say that we're 90 sure that
the true efficacy in the world population as a whole will be this no that's not what it means it means
if we ran the study a hundred times over just imagine what that would cost and how long that
would take but if we ran it a hundred times over every time we're going to get slightly different
confidence intervals in 90 of those the true population will be true population efficacy will
be within the confidence intervals that we set so we're not saying that's true for this specific one
is if we could do it 100 times over in 90 of them 90 of them will capture within its bounds the true
population efficacy now that we've done that let's go and see this trial that was done in south africa
with the astrazeneca trial and now this trial i'm going to warn you i mean from the time of this recording
it's just on as a available the pre-print it was not not accepted by a journal yet not peer-reviewed yet
and on the space on the evidence of this very small study the the vaccine was withdrawn from south
africa so there was about a million doses available that was the first doses of any vaccine to land in
south africa it was ready to be distributed amongst healthcare workers and it got pulled
on the strength of the study now the study has more than one component so what we're going to look
at is just the clinical side of it looking at the relative risk and the efficacy but it was also about
it was about more than that there was a part of analysis was also on the neutralizing antibodies
and whether they could were effective against the the the variant that's prevalent within south africa
so it's not just based on this but i want to show you what what the what relative risk does in efficacy
what it would look like at least the uncertainty in the value when we're dealing with a small trial and
how difficult it becomes in a small trial where the risk is relatively low so let's look at that so
you can click on the link there to find the pre-print of this article and there were some pertinent
points so the primary endpoint and i've just listed them here the primary endpoint was this
efficacy of confirmed symptomatic covert 19 more than 14 days after the second dose
so waited 14 days after the second dose then start looking at whether people develop confirmed
symptomatic covert so the primary for the primary efficacy analysis only per per vertical seronegative
participants were included and the vaccine efficacy ve was calculated as one minus the relative
risk and 95 confidence intervals were calculated using the clopper-pearson exact method as reported
so that's not what we're doing we are using resampling which is what i like to do there's a bunch of
these tests and they have their strengths and weaknesses and debate about you know whether
they work or not and when they should be used and when not my feeling on the matter use use resampling
so with a thousand and ten participants received vaccine and a thousand and eleven received placebo
and in the end there was a lot of exclusions you can read the paper as to why in the end though
remember our simulated study before had over 40 000 people in them 20 more than 20 000 each arm yeah
there was only 715 in the vaccine group that was analyzed in 700 and 750 vaccine 717 in the placebo group
so very small now and other problems with the trial and and i don't say that's problems the trial was
correctly done is that we want to infer that to a larger population the population out there
and of course the participants in the study were not representative of the population as a whole
it was only representative of certain people in the population because the median age was very young
it was only 31 years 56 and a half percent were male and then there was a racial distribution as well
all 42 endpoint cases were graded as either mild or moderate so there were no severe cases
following this trial so even in the placebo group there was no severe cases and we can see in the vaccine
group 15 mild and 4 moderate and then 17 mild and 6 moderate so there are no cases of severe disease
or hospitalization in either arm so that makes it very difficult because half of these people receive
placebo to infer the results to the larger population so let's just see how they you know if we do the
relative risk and we look specifically at uncertainty around the relative risk that's what this is all about
so there were 717 in the control group 750 in the treatment group 17 plus 6 that's the mild plus moderate
i got the disease in the control group and 15 plus 4 that's in the treatment group
so we're going to work out the risk in the control group which is just that very simple ratio and the
risk in the treatment group so that we can express the relative risk and the relative risk as you can
see there that was lower than one so we subtract it from one and we get the efficacy and that was the
headline it was only 21 effective only 21 effective and of course mostly you'll see that we're looking
for at least 50 efficacy in these but here comes the problem we need to express our uncertainty
in this 21 efficacy and so again we're going to create our two functions the one that just simulates
again from a random uniform distribution just as we did before only counting those that was lower
than this risk value and then we're going to simulate it the two risks and we express the
efficacy again as one minus the risk two over risk one so risk of the treatment divided by risk of the
control group and our p values here again remember that is taken from the outcome of this actual study
the two risks and then we're going to simulate it and i've run a simulation just this once
and we get a negative value we get a negative value and now this becomes very difficult to
interpret and let me show you why because now we're going to simulate it a thousand times
using this two vec function so we can do list or vector comprehension so in one go we get our thousand
values and here i've used plotly and not the inbuilt r plotting so we can see here this distribution
around the around the efficacy and you can see how it tails off below zero now how do we interpret that
so i'll leave that for you in the comments to interpret that because if you think about it we're actually
back in the real realm of the vaccine actually increasing the risk okay and that's the way
that the values are going to come out and you can see this bump here right at the top it is at about
about 21 22 23 percent and the efficacy and what we're interested in now is the 95 confidence intervals
so we said the efficacy of this study of the astrazeneca
vaccine was only 21 percent and now you see the 95 confidence intervals around that
from negative 50 percent to about 59 percent
so it's quite possible that the efficacy of this the efficacy out in the population just based on the
study that the efficacy of astrazeneca vaccine out in the population is somewhere between there
so this is bizarre on this side of course and as i say leave your thoughts in the comment what this
negative values would really be but this is we're still within the 95 confidence intervals almost 60
efficacy of the astrazeneca so very difficult to make decisions based on a small study like this
where our risk is very low
the risk was very low for someone to develop the disease both in the placebo arm and in the treatment
arm and the efficacy the the the two risks were very close to each other meaning the efficacy was only
21 percent but because these values are so small and we simulate a thousand of these when we express our
uncertainty in this 21 percent you see that this uncertainty is quite big and as i say this
the the the idea behind the study was not only looking at this to make the decision to withdraw
the use of the vaccine the astrazeneca vaccine in south africa because a part of the study was also
about neutralizing antibodies etc there's a whole you know other parts to that but see how difficult
it is or how difficult it can be if you've got relatively small sample sizes and the risk is also
small then you are going to struggle to just make a decision because your uncertainty and your efficacy
is not going to be very good there's going to be a wide confidence interval in the efficacy
so i hope this was interesting for you leave some comments down below remember to like the video
you can read this these notebooks here on our pubs or follow the link down below to download the rmd
files the r markdown files if you've got our studio you can just import that and you can play around with
these values maybe simulate some more and draw some prettier graphs etc and i hope this really helped
you to understand the idea a very relevant example of understanding relative risk and efficacy
