The text explains how to transition from understanding sequences to defining and working with series in mathematics. A sequence is an ordered list of elements (e.g., \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\)), which can be expressed as \(a_n\) where \(n\) ranges from 1 to infinity.

A series, on the other hand, is defined as a sequence of partial sums. This means that instead of looking at each term individually, we consider the cumulative sum of terms up to a certain point. For example, if you have a series represented by \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\), the partial sums are \(s_1 = a_1\), \(s_2 = a_1 + a_2\), \(s_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3\), and so on. These partial sums (\(s_n\)) form a new sequence.

The core idea is that while the original series involves adding terms indefinitely, it's the behavior of these partial sums as \(n\) approaches infinity that determines whether the series converges or diverges. If the sequence of partial sums converges to a specific value \(L\), then the series itself is said to converge to \(L\). Conversely, if the sequence of partial sums does not approach any limit, the series diverges.

The text sets up further exploration into properties and operations involving series, such as convergence tests, differentiation, integration, addition, multiplication, and division of series. Understanding sequences is fundamental because it provides tools for analyzing whether a series converges or diverges based on the behavior of its partial sums.
