The text explains how to transition from understanding sequences to defining and working with series in mathematics. A sequence is an ordered list of elements (e.g., \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\)), which can be expressed as \(a_n\) where \(n\) ranges from 1 to infinity.

A series, on the other hand, is defined as a sequence of partial sums. This means that instead of looking at each term individually, we consider the cumulative sum of terms up to a certain point. For example, if you have a series represented by \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\), the partial sums are \(s_1 = a_1\), \(s_2 = a_1 + a_2\), \(s_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3\), and so on. These partial sums (\(s_n\)) form a new sequence.

The core idea is that while the original series involves adding terms indefinitely, it's the behavior of these partial sums as \(n\) approaches infinity that determines whether the series converges or diverges. If the sequence of partial sums converges to a specific value \(L\), then the series itself is said to converge to \(L\). Conversely, if the sequence of partial sums does not approach any limit, the series diverges.

The text sets up further exploration into properties and operations involving series, such as convergence tests, differentiation, integration, addition, multiplication, and division of series. Understanding sequences is fundamental because it provides tools for analyzing whether a series converges or diverges based on the behavior of its partial sums.

The text explains how to transition from understanding sequences to defining and working with series in mathematics. A sequence is defined as an ordered list of elements (e.g., \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\)), which can be expressed using notation like \(a_n\) where \(n\) ranges from 1 to infinity.

A series, on the other hand, is described as a sequence of partial sums derived from an infinite sum. For instance, if you consider the sum \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\), this represents \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots\) up to infinity. The series itself is then constructed by considering each partial sum (e.g., the sum of the first three terms: \(s_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3\)) and treating these partial sums as elements of a new sequence (\(s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_n\)).

The concept of convergence is crucial in this context. A series converges if the sequence of its partial sums approaches a specific finite limit \(L\) as \(n\) goes to infinity. Conversely, it diverges if this sequence does not approach any single value. Understanding whether a series converges or diverges involves techniques and principles that are often first explored through sequences. Series can be manipulated in various ways—such as differentiation, integration, addition, multiplication, and division—provided they meet certain conditions for these operations.
