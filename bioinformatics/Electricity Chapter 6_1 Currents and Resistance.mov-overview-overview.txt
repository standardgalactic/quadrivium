The text provides an overview of electric current, focusing on electron flow in conductors and includes key theoretical concepts as well as practical problem-solving approaches related to current density. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Electric Current**: Defined as the flow of electrons driven by an electric field, with electrons moving opposite to the field direction.

2. **Conditions for Current Flow**: Electron movement alone does not constitute current; it requires a net flow resulting from an external electric field.

3. **Current Direction Convention**: Despite electron movement being from negative to positive terminals, conventionally, current is described as flowing from positive to negative due to historical reasons linked with proton flow analogies.

4. **Current as a Scalar Quantity**: Current is defined by \( I = \frac{dq}{dt} \) and considered scalar despite having direction because it involves only the magnitude of charge flow over time.

5. **Charge Conservation**: The total current before splitting at any junction equals the sum of currents after splitting, ensuring conservation of charge.

6. **Drift Velocity**: In conductors, electrons have a slow drift velocity superimposed on their random motion, causing net charge flow that constitutes electric current.

7. **Current and Charge Density**: Current density (\( J \)) is defined as \( J = \frac{I}{A} \). It's related to the number of charge carriers per unit volume (\( n \times e \)).

8. **Problem Example**: The text ends with a problem calculating current through part of a cylindrical wire using given current density and dimensions, highlighting practical application.

**Calculating Current Using Integration:**

1. **Constant Current Density**: 
   - Multiply the constant current density (\( j \)) by the differential area \( 2\pi r \, dr \).
   - Integrate across specified limits to find total current:
     \[
     I = \int_{0.001}^{0.002} j \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
     \]
   - With \( j = 2.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{A/m}^2 \), the result is approximately 1.9 A.

2. **Variable Current Density**:
   - For a current density varying with radius as \( j = 3.0 \times 10^{11} r^2 \):
     \[
     dI = 6.0 \times 10^{11} \pi r^3 \, dr
     \]
   - Integrate to find total current:
     \[
     I = \int_{0.001}^{0.002} 6.0 \times 10^{11} \pi r^3 \, dr
     \]

This summary encapsulates the fundamental concepts of electric current and resistance with an emphasis on practical calculations using integration for both constant and variable current densities.
