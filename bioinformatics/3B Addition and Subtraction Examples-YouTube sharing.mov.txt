Example time. Here we have two matrices, A and B. We are asked three questions. First A plus B, then A minus B, and lastly B minus A.
To answer these questions, first see if addition and multiplication is indeed possible. This can only be done if the two matrices are of equal size.
Matrix A is of size 3 by 3, and so is matrix B. We can therefore add and subtract. Let's go for A plus B.
Remember, we simply add the elements with the same addresses. That is, AIJ plus BIJ.
So if I is 1, meaning row 1, and J is 1, meaning column 1, we add the values of these two addresses.
3 plus negative 3 equals 0. When I is 1, meaning still row 1, and J equals 2, meaning column 2, it means we add 4 plus 4, and that equals 8.
To complete the question, we simply go along all the addresses. Let's look at question 2, A minus B.
The same applies for the addresses, so it will be 3 minus negative 3, which is 6, then 4 minus 4, which is 0, and so on.
For the last question, it's A subtracted from B, or B plus negative A, as we have seen 4.
For I equal to 1, and J equal to 1, the answer will be negative 3 minus 3, and that is negative 6.
Next will be 4 minus 4, and that is 0. Then negative 1 minus 7, which is negative 8.
It is easy to do addition and subtraction. Just remember, the matrices must be of the same size, and keep the elements with the same addresses together.
next to 5, we are going to make zero.
