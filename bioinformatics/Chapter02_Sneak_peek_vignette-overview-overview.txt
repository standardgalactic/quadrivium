In Lecture 2, participants are encouraged to relax while getting an early glimpse into the course material. Although there's a lot of computer code being written during this lecture, attendees do not need to concentrate on comprehending it at this point. Instead, they should focus on the statistical results that emerge from these computations. By the end of the session, participants will have a clear understanding of what has been achieved and shown on the screen. The main emphasis is on appreciating the outcomes rather than delving into the coding details.
