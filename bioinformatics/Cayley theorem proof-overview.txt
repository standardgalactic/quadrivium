To demonstrate how Cayley's Theorem allows us to show that any group is isomorphic to some permutation group, let's first recap what it means for a function \( f: A \to B \) to be bijective.

### Bijective Mapping

1. **Injective (One-to-One):** 
   - A function \( f \) is injective if different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain. Formally, for all \( a_1, a_2 \in A \), if \( f(a_1) = f(a_2) \), then \( a_1 = a_2 \).

2. **Surjective (Onto):** 
   - A function \( f \) is surjective if every element in the codomain has at least one pre-image in the domain. Formally, for all \( b \in B \), there exists an \( a \in A \) such that \( f(a) = b \).

3. **Bijective:**
   - A function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective.

### Cayley's Theorem

Cayley's Theorem states that every group \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on \( G \). Here's how we can construct such an isomorphism:

#### Construction

1. **Consider the Group \( G \):**
   - Let \( G = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n\} \) be a finite group with identity element \( e \).

2. **Define a Permutation for Each Element:**
   - For each element \( g_i \in G \), define a function (permutation) \( \phi_{g_i}: G \to G \) by:
     \[
     \phi_{g_i}(x) = g_i \cdot x
     \]
   - Here, \( \cdot \) denotes the group operation.

3. **Verify that \( \phi_{g_i} \) is a Permutation:**
   - **Injective:** If \( \phi_{g_i}(x_1) = \phi_{g_i}(x_2) \), then \( g_i \cdot x_1 = g_i \cdot x_2 \). By the cancellation law (since groups have inverses), \( x_1 = x_2 \).
   - **Surjective:** For any \( y \in G \), we need an \( x \in G \) such that \( \phi_{g_i}(x) = y \). Set \( x = g_i^{-1} \cdot y \). Then:
     \[
     \phi_{g_i}(x) = g_i \cdot (g_i^{-1} \cdot y) = (g_i \cdot g_i^{-1}) \cdot y = e \cdot y = y
     \]
   - Therefore, \( \phi_{g_i} \) is a bijection.

4. **Map Group Elements to Permutations:**
   - Define the function \( \Phi: G \to S_G \) (where \( S_G \) is the symmetric group on \( G \)) by:
     \[
     \Phi(g_i) = \phi_{g_i}
     \]

5. **Show that \( \Phi \) is an Isomorphism:**
   - **Homomorphism:** For any \( g_i, g_j \in G \),
     \[
     \Phi(g_i \cdot g_j)(x) = (g_i \cdot g_j) \cdot x = g_i \cdot (g_j \cdot x) = \phi_{g_i}(\phi_{g_j}(x)) = (\Phi(g_i) \circ \Phi(g_j))(x)
     \]
     Thus, \( \Phi(g_i \cdot g_j) = \Phi(g_i) \circ \Phi(g_j) \).

   - **Injective:** If \( \Phi(g_i) = \Phi(g_j) \), then \( \phi_{g_i} = \phi_{g_j} \). In particular, \( \phi_{g_i}(e) = g_i \cdot e = g_i \) and \( \phi_{g_j}(e) = g_j \cdot e = g_j \). Thus, \( g_i = g_j \).

   - **Surjective onto Image:** The image of \( \Phi \) is a subgroup of \( S_G \), and every element in the image corresponds to some permutation defined by an element of \( G \).

Thus, \( \Phi \) provides an isomorphism from \( G \) to a subgroup of \( S_G \), demonstrating that any group is isomorphic to a permutation group. This completes the proof of Cayley's Theorem.

The text explains the concept of constructing a proof related to Cayley's theorem, which states that every group is isomorphic to a permutation group. Here's a summary:

1. **Definitions**:
   - **Injective (One-to-One)**: A function where different inputs map to different outputs.
   - **Surjective (Onto)**: Every element in the target set has at least one pre-image in the domain.
   - **Bijective**: A function that is both injective and surjective.

2. **Cayley's Theorem**:
   - The theorem asserts that every group can be represented as a permutation group, meaning there exists an isomorphism between any given group and some permutation group.

3. **Constructing the Proof**:
   - Consider a group \( G \) with elements and a binary operation.
   - Construct a mapping \( f_a: G \to S_G \), where \( S_G \) is the set of permutations of \( G \).
   - For each element \( g \in G \), define \( f_a(g) = aga^{-1} \).

4. **Properties**:
   - **Injectivity**: Show that if \( f_a(g_1) = f_a(g_2) \), then \( g_1 = g_2 \). This is done by using the group properties, specifically associativity and inverses.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any permutation in \( S_G \), there exists a corresponding element in \( G \) such that applying the mapping yields that permutation. This is shown by expressing any permutation as a conjugation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The constructed function \( f_a \) is bijective, establishing an isomorphism between \( G \) and a permutation group.
   - Thus, every group is isomorphic to some permutation group, proving Cayley's theorem.

The text uses an example with the fourth roots of unity under multiplication to illustrate these concepts.
