To demonstrate how Cayley's Theorem allows us to show that any group is isomorphic to some permutation group, let's first recap what it means for a function \( f: A \to B \) to be bijective.

### Bijective Mapping

1. **Injective (One-to-One):** 
   - A function \( f \) is injective if different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain. Formally, for all \( a_1, a_2 \in A \), if \( f(a_1) = f(a_2) \), then \( a_1 = a_2 \).

2. **Surjective (Onto):** 
   - A function \( f \) is surjective if every element in the codomain has at least one pre-image in the domain. Formally, for all \( b \in B \), there exists an \( a \in A \) such that \( f(a) = b \).

3. **Bijective:**
   - A function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective.

### Cayley's Theorem

Cayley's Theorem states that every group \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on \( G \). Here's how we can construct such an isomorphism:

#### Construction

1. **Consider the Group \( G \):**
   - Let \( G = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n\} \) be a finite group with identity element \( e \).

2. **Define a Permutation for Each Element:**
   - For each element \( g_i \in G \), define a function (permutation) \( \phi_{g_i}: G \to G \) by:
     \[
     \phi_{g_i}(x) = g_i \cdot x
     \]
   - Here, \( \cdot \) denotes the group operation.

3. **Verify that \( \phi_{g_i} \) is a Permutation:**
   - **Injective:** If \( \phi_{g_i}(x_1) = \phi_{g_i}(x_2) \), then \( g_i \cdot x_1 = g_i \cdot x_2 \). By the cancellation law (since groups have inverses), \( x_1 = x_2 \).
   - **Surjective:** For any \( y \in G \), we need an \( x \in G \) such that \( \phi_{g_i}(x) = y \). Set \( x = g_i^{-1} \cdot y \). Then:
     \[
     \phi_{g_i}(x) = g_i \cdot (g_i^{-1} \cdot y) = (g_i \cdot g_i^{-1}) \cdot y = e \cdot y = y
     \]
   - Therefore, \( \phi_{g_i} \) is a bijection.

4. **Map Group Elements to Permutations:**
   - Define the function \( \Phi: G \to S_G \) (where \( S_G \) is the symmetric group on \( G \)) by:
     \[
     \Phi(g_i) = \phi_{g_i}
     \]

5. **Show that \( \Phi \) is an Isomorphism:**
   - **Homomorphism:** For any \( g_i, g_j \in G \),
     \[
     \Phi(g_i \cdot g_j)(x) = (g_i \cdot g_j) \cdot x = g_i \cdot (g_j \cdot x) = \phi_{g_i}(\phi_{g_j}(x)) = (\Phi(g_i) \circ \Phi(g_j))(x)
     \]
     Thus, \( \Phi(g_i \cdot g_j) = \Phi(g_i) \circ \Phi(g_j) \).

   - **Injective:** If \( \Phi(g_i) = \Phi(g_j) \), then \( \phi_{g_i} = \phi_{g_j} \). In particular, \( \phi_{g_i}(e) = g_i \cdot e = g_i \) and \( \phi_{g_j}(e) = g_j \cdot e = g_j \). Thus, \( g_i = g_j \).

   - **Surjective onto Image:** The image of \( \Phi \) is a subgroup of \( S_G \), and every element in the image corresponds to some permutation defined by an element of \( G \).

Thus, \( \Phi \) provides an isomorphism from \( G \) to a subgroup of \( S_G \), demonstrating that any group is isomorphic to a permutation group. This completes the proof of Cayley's Theorem.

The text explains the concept of constructing a proof related to Cayley's theorem, which states that every group is isomorphic to a permutation group. Here's a summary:

1. **Definitions**:
   - **Injective (One-to-One)**: A function where different inputs map to different outputs.
   - **Surjective (Onto)**: Every element in the target set has at least one pre-image in the domain.
   - **Bijective**: A function that is both injective and surjective.

2. **Cayley's Theorem**:
   - The theorem asserts that every group can be represented as a permutation group, meaning there exists an isomorphism between any given group and some permutation group.

3. **Constructing the Proof**:
   - Consider a group \( G \) with elements and a binary operation.
   - Construct a mapping \( f_a: G \to S_G \), where \( S_G \) is the set of permutations of \( G \).
   - For each element \( g \in G \), define \( f_a(g) = aga^{-1} \).

4. **Properties**:
   - **Injectivity**: Show that if \( f_a(g_1) = f_a(g_2) \), then \( g_1 = g_2 \). This is done by using the group properties, specifically associativity and inverses.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any permutation in \( S_G \), there exists a corresponding element in \( G \) such that applying the mapping yields that permutation. This is shown by expressing any permutation as a conjugation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The constructed function \( f_a \) is bijective, establishing an isomorphism between \( G \) and a permutation group.
   - Thus, every group is isomorphic to some permutation group, proving Cayley's theorem.

The text uses an example with the fourth roots of unity under multiplication to illustrate these concepts.

To address your query, let's break down the concept of isomorphisms between groups and how Cayley's Theorem establishes that any group can be represented as a permutation group.

### Isomorphism Between Groups

An **isomorphism** between two groups \( G \) and \( H \) is a bijective homomorphism, meaning it is both a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) and respects the group operation. Formally, a function \( f: G \to H \) is an isomorphism if:

1. **Homomorphic Property**: For all elements \( g_1, g_2 \in G \), we have:
   \[
   f(g_1 \cdot g_2) = f(g_1) \cdot f(g_2)
   \]
   where \( \cdot \) denotes the group operation in both \( G \) and \( H \).

2. **Bijective Mapping**:
   - **Injective**: For all \( g_1, g_2 \in G \), if \( f(g_1) = f(g_2) \), then \( g_1 = g_2 \).
   - **Surjective**: For every element \( h \in H \), there exists an element \( g \in G \) such that \( f(g) = h \).

### Cayley's Theorem

Cayley's Theorem states that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on the group itself. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Permutation Representation**: For any element \( g \in G \), define a function (permutation) \( \phi_g: G \to G \) by:
   \[
   \phi_g(x) = g \cdot x
   \]
   for all \( x \in G \). This is essentially left multiplication by \( g \).

2. **Homomorphism**: The map from each group element to its corresponding permutation, \( \Phi: G \to S_G \) (where \( S_G \) is the symmetric group on \( G \)), defined by:
   \[
   \Phi(g) = \phi_g
   \]
   is a homomorphism because for any \( g_1, g_2 \in G \):
   \[
   \Phi(g_1 \cdot g_2)(x) = (g_1 \cdot g_2) \cdot x = g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot x) = (\phi_{g_1} \circ \phi_{g_2})(x)
   \]
   Thus, \( \Phi(g_1 \cdot g_2) = \Phi(g_1) \circ \Phi(g_2) \).

3. **Injective**: The map \( \Phi \) is injective because if \( \Phi(g_1) = \Phi(g_2) \), then for all \( x \in G \):
   \[
   g_1 \cdot x = g_2 \cdot x
   \]
   Setting \( x = e \) (the identity element of \( G \)), we get \( g_1 = g_2 \).

4. **Permutation Group**: The image of \( \Phi \), denoted as \( \text{Im}(\Phi) \), is a subgroup of the symmetric group \( S_G \). This means every group can be represented as permutations on its elements.

### Conclusion

Cayley's Theorem elegantly shows that any abstract group can be concretely realized as permutations, making it a powerful tool in understanding group structures. It provides a bridge between abstract algebra and combinatorial concepts by embedding groups into symmetric groups.

The text describes the process of proving Cayley's Theorem, which states that every group is isomorphic to a permutation group. Here's a summary:

1. **Definitions**: 
   - A function is **injective** if different inputs map to different outputs.
   - A function is **surjective** if every element in the target set has a pre-image in the domain.
   - A function that is both injective and surjective is called **bijective**.

2. **Cayley's Theorem**: 
   - For any group \( G \), you can construct a permutation group that is isomorphic to \( G \).

3. **Construction of Isomorphism**:
   - Start with a group \( G \) and its elements.
   - Define a mapping \( f_a: G \to S_G \) (where \( S_G \) is the set of permutations of \( G \)) by composing each element \( g \in G \) with a fixed element \( a \in G \).
   - This mapping creates permutations of \( G \).

4. **Example**:
   - Consider the group formed by the fourth roots of unity under multiplication: \( \{1, i, -1, -i\} \).
   - Construct permutations for each group element by multiplying it with all elements in the group.

5. **Proving Injectivity**:
   - Show that if \( f_a(g_1) = f_a(g_2) \), then \( g_1 = g_2 \). This uses properties like associativity and inverses.

6. **Proving Surjectivity**:
   - For any permutation in the set, find a corresponding element in \( G \) that maps to it using the inverse of group elements.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The mapping is bijective, proving that every group is isomorphic to some permutation group, thus establishing Cayley's Theorem.
