So this course on limits. We're trying to build up to calculus but limits are so fascinating and so

acute care surgery at Gritteskeer Hospital in Cape Town and also a senior lecturer in surgery
at the University of Cape Town. Now who's this course for? This course is for everyone involved
in life sciences. So whether you do social sciences, biology, healthcare, it doesn't matter
this course is for you and as I said in the introduction I'm going to be very tough on
this mathematics. We're going to learn how to do it properly. So let's get started.
