The text describes how to derive the three fundamental equations for simple harmonic motion (SHM) using the concept of uniform circular motion. The key points are:

1. **Displacement**: SHM can be visualized as the projection of a point moving in a circle at constant angular velocity onto an axis. If \( x(t) \) is the displacement, it is given by:
   \[
   x(t) = x_m \cos(\omega t + \phi)
   \]
   where \( x_m \) is the amplitude, \( \omega \) is the angular velocity, and \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

2. **Velocity**: The velocity in SHM is derived by differentiating the displacement equation with respect to time or from the geometry of uniform circular motion:
   \[
   v(t) = -\omega x_m \sin(\omega t + \phi)
   \]
   This shows that the velocity is zero at maximum displacement and reaches its maximum value as it passes through the equilibrium position.

3. **Acceleration**: The acceleration is derived by differentiating the velocity equation or using centripetal acceleration from circular motion:
   \[
   a(t) = -\omega^2 x_m \cos(\omega t + \phi)
   \]
   This indicates that acceleration is maximum at the points of maximum displacement and zero at the equilibrium position.

The text emphasizes understanding SHM through its relationship with uniform circular motion, highlighting how angular velocity and trigonometric functions describe the oscillatory behavior.

The text explains how to derive the three fundamental equations for simple harmonic motion (SHM) by relating it to uniform circular motion with constant angular velocity. Here's a summary of the derivation:

1. **Displacement Equation**: 
   - SHM can be visualized as the projection of uniform circular motion onto an axis.
   - If point \( P' \) moves in a circle, its projection \( P \) on the x-axis exhibits simple harmonic motion.
   - The displacement \( x(t) \) is given by:
     \[
     x(t) = x_m \cos(\omega t + \phi)
     \]
   - Here, \( x_m \) is the amplitude, \( \omega \) is the angular velocity, and \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

2. **Velocity Equation**:
   - The velocity \( v(t) \) is derived by differentiating the displacement with respect to time.
   - Using trigonometric identities and circular motion principles, the velocity equation is:
     \[
     v(t) = -\omega x_m \sin(\omega t + \phi)
     \]
   - The maximum velocity \( v_m \) is given by \( \omega x_m \).

3. **Acceleration Equation**:
   - The acceleration \( a(t) \) is found by differentiating the velocity with respect to time.
   - Using centripetal acceleration concepts, the equation for acceleration in SHM is:
     \[
     a(t) = -\omega^2 x_m \cos(\omega t + \phi)
     \]
   - The maximum acceleration \( a_m \) is \( \omega^2 x_m \).

These equations describe how displacement, velocity, and acceleration vary with time in simple harmonic motion.
