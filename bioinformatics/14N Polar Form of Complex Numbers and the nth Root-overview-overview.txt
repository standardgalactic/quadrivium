The provided text outlines the process of converting complex numbers into polar form using two examples: \(-3 - 3i\) and \(2\sqrt{3} - 2i\).

### Example 1: \(-3 - 3i\)

1. **Plotting on the Complex Plane:**
   - The number is plotted in the third quadrant by moving left 3 units (real part) and down 3 units (imaginary part).

2. **Angle Calculation:**
   - The angle from the positive real axis is \(225^\circ\) or \(\frac{5\pi}{4}\) radians.
   - Adjusted to polar conventions, this becomes \(-\frac{3\pi}{4}\).

3. **Modulus Calculation:**
   - The modulus \(r\) is \(\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}\).

4. **Polar Form Representation:**
   - Expressed as \(3\sqrt{2} (\cos(-3\pi/4) + i\sin(-3\pi/4))\).

### Example 2: \(2\sqrt{3} - 2i\)

1. **Context and Modulus Calculation:**
   - The modulus is calculated as \(\sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 + (-2)^2} = 4\).

2. **Trigonometric Values:**
   - Cosine of the angle is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and sine is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

3. **Quadrant Determination:**
   - The number is in the fourth quadrant since cosine is positive and sine is negative.

4. **Angle Identification:**
   - The angle is identified as \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians.

5. **Polar Form Representation:**
   - Expressed as \(4e^{i(-\pi/6)}\) or \(4(\cos(-\pi/6) + i\sin(-\pi/6))\).

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding trigonometric values and their signs in different quadrants to determine angles for complex numbers in polar form.
