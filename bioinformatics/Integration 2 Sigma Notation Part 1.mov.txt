In this video we will take a quick look at sigma notation.
It is shorthand for the addition of various elements where each element has a single variable
usually called k that can appear once or more in that element and the value of k increases
by 1 in each successive element.
The value of k in the first element is given here and the final value of k in the last
element is given here.
So here in our first example we have the element k starting at a value of 0 and ending in
a value of 3.
Simply write each element incrementing by 1 and add them all.
This will be 0 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 and that equals 6.
In example 2 we have the element as k plus k squared starting at 0 and ending at 2.
That is 0 plus 0 squared plus 1 plus 1 squared plus 2 plus 2 squared.
And that is 0 plus 2 plus 6 and that equals 8.
So here we have the element of k equals 8.
