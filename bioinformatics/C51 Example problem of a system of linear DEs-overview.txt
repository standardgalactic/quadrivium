The text describes a process of solving a system of linear differential equations, specifically using an example related to a saltwater solution entering and exiting a tank. The goal is to become familiar with different notations for variables in such systems.

Here's a summary of the steps involved:

1. **Notation:** Instead of using \( x \) and \( y \), the system uses \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).

2. **Differential Formulation:** The equations are initially written in differential form:
   - Equation 1: \(\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \frac{2}{25}x_1 - \frac{1}{50}x_2 = 0\)
   - Equation 2: \(\frac{d}{dt}x_2 + \frac{2}{25}x_2 - \frac{2}{25}x_1 = 0\)

3. **Solving for a Variable:** Solve equation 2 for \( x_2 \) in terms of \( x_1 \):
   - \( x_2 = \frac{2}{25}\left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_1 \)

4. **Substitution:** Substitute the expression for \( x_2 \) back into equation 1, resulting in:
   - \(\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \frac{2}{25}x_1 - \frac{1}{50}\left(\frac{2}{25}\left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_1\right) = 0\)

5. **Simplification:** Rearrange and simplify the equation to resemble a polynomial form with the differential operator:
   - Multiply through by \((\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25})^2\) to eliminate fractions, leading to:
     \[
     \left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^2 x_1 + \frac{4}{25}\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \left(\frac{4}{625} - \frac{1}{625}\right)x_1 = 0
     \]

6. **Final Form:** The final simplified differential equation is:
   - \(\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^2 x_1 + \frac{4}{25}\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \frac{3}{625}x_1 = 0\)

This process illustrates how to manipulate and solve a system of linear differential equations by substitution and algebraic manipulation.

The text describes solving a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The given differential equation is:

\[ \frac{d^2x_1}{dt^2} + \frac{4}{25}\frac{dx_1}{dt} + \frac{3}{625}x_1 = 0 \]

This can be solved using the auxiliary (or characteristic) equation method. The corresponding quadratic auxiliary equation is:

\[ m^2 + \frac{4}{25}m + \frac{3}{625} = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots:

- \( m_1 = -\frac{1}{25} \)
- \( m_2 = -\frac{3}{25} \)

Using these roots, the general solution for \( x_1(t) \) is:

\[ x_1(t) = c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} \]

Next, to solve for \( x_2(t) \), the text suggests isolating \( x_1 \) from equation 1:

\[ x_1 = \frac{1}{50x_2}\left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_2 \]

Given that \( x_2 = 0 \), it simplifies the process, and a similar differential equation is derived for \( x_2(t) \):

\[ \left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)^2 x_2 = 0 \]

This indicates that solving for \( x_2(t) \) follows a similar approach to the one used for \( x_1(t) \).

The text describes solving a system of differential equations by finding particular solutions. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The problem involves two related differential equations with expressions involving terms like \( \frac{4}{25} d x_2 \), \( \frac{4}{625} x_2 \), and others, resulting in an equation that simplifies to zero.

2. **Common Solutions**: The text notes that the characteristic roots for both equations are identical, implying similar solutions (denoted as \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \)) for each part of the system.

3. **Solution Formulation**:
   - For \( x_1(t) \), the solution involves terms like \( c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} \) and \( c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} \).
   - Similarly, for \( x_2(t) \), solutions involve \( c_3 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} \) and \( c_4 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} \).

4. **Linear System**: The system is linear, so coefficients can be expressed in terms of each other. The text sets up a substitution to express \( c_3 \) and \( c_4 \) using \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

5. **Derivation**:
   - By differentiating the expression for \( x_1(t) \), substituting into the differential equation, and simplifying, it derives relationships between coefficients.
   - The process involves multiplying through by a constant (50) to eliminate fractions, then grouping like terms.

6. **Coefficient Matching**: The final step is equating coefficients of similar exponential terms to zero, ensuring the solution holds for any \( t \).

This approach systematically finds specific solutions for the differential equations by leveraging their shared characteristics and solving for unknowns through substitution and simplification.

The text describes solving a system of equations involving exponential functions, likely related to an initial value problem in differential equations. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The author discusses setting up two equations where certain terms cannot be zero for any value of \( t \). This leads to the following conditions:
   - \(-2c_1 - c_3 = 0\)
   - \(-2c_2 - c_4 = 0\)

2. **Solving for Constants**:
   - From these, it's determined that \( c_3 = -2c_1 \) and \( c_4 = -2c_2 \).
   - Further, it is found that \( c_4 = 2c_2 \), leading to the conclusion that \( c_3 = 2c_1 \).

3. **Expression for Functions**:
   - The functions are expressed as:
     - \( x_1(t) = c_1 e^{-t/25} + c_2 e^{-3t/25} \)
     - \( x_2(t) = 2c_1 e^{-t/25} - 2c_2 e^{-3t/25} \)

4. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The initial conditions given are:
     - \( x_1(0) = 25 \)
     - \( x_2(0) = 0 \)

5. **Solving Initial Value Problem**:
   - Applying the initial conditions, the equations become:
     - \( c_1 + c_2 = 25 \)
     - \( 2c_1 - 2c_2 = 0 \)
   - Solving these, it is found that \( c_1 = c_2 = 12.5 \).

6. **Final Solutions**:
   - The solutions for the functions are:
     - \( x_1(t) = \frac{25}{2} e^{-t/25} + \frac{25}{2} e^{-3t/25} \)
     - \( x_2(t) = 25 e^{-t/25} - 25 e^{-3t/25} \)

The author notes the complexity and effort involved in solving such problems, mentioning it took several pages.

The text describes a process where one follows known steps repeatedly until reaching a solution. It emphasizes persistence in executing these familiar actions until the desired outcome is achieved.
