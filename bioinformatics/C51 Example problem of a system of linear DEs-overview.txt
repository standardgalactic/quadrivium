The text describes a process of solving a system of linear differential equations, specifically using an example related to a saltwater solution entering and exiting a tank. The goal is to become familiar with different notations for variables in such systems.

Here's a summary of the steps involved:

1. **Notation:** Instead of using \( x \) and \( y \), the system uses \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).

2. **Differential Formulation:** The equations are initially written in differential form:
   - Equation 1: \(\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \frac{2}{25}x_1 - \frac{1}{50}x_2 = 0\)
   - Equation 2: \(\frac{d}{dt}x_2 + \frac{2}{25}x_2 - \frac{2}{25}x_1 = 0\)

3. **Solving for a Variable:** Solve equation 2 for \( x_2 \) in terms of \( x_1 \):
   - \( x_2 = \frac{2}{25}\left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_1 \)

4. **Substitution:** Substitute the expression for \( x_2 \) back into equation 1, resulting in:
   - \(\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \frac{2}{25}x_1 - \frac{1}{50}\left(\frac{2}{25}\left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_1\right) = 0\)

5. **Simplification:** Rearrange and simplify the equation to resemble a polynomial form with the differential operator:
   - Multiply through by \((\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25})^2\) to eliminate fractions, leading to:
     \[
     \left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^2 x_1 + \frac{4}{25}\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \left(\frac{4}{625} - \frac{1}{625}\right)x_1 = 0
     \]

6. **Final Form:** The final simplified differential equation is:
   - \(\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^2 x_1 + \frac{4}{25}\frac{d}{dt}x_1 + \frac{3}{625}x_1 = 0\)

This process illustrates how to manipulate and solve a system of linear differential equations by substitution and algebraic manipulation.

The text describes solving a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The given differential equation is:

\[ \frac{d^2x_1}{dt^2} + \frac{4}{25}\frac{dx_1}{dt} + \frac{3}{625}x_1 = 0 \]

This can be solved using the auxiliary (or characteristic) equation method. The corresponding quadratic auxiliary equation is:

\[ m^2 + \frac{4}{25}m + \frac{3}{625} = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots:

- \( m_1 = -\frac{1}{25} \)
- \( m_2 = -\frac{3}{25} \)

Using these roots, the general solution for \( x_1(t) \) is:

\[ x_1(t) = c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} \]

Next, to solve for \( x_2(t) \), the text suggests isolating \( x_1 \) from equation 1:

\[ x_1 = \frac{1}{50x_2}\left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_2 \]

Given that \( x_2 = 0 \), it simplifies the process, and a similar differential equation is derived for \( x_2(t) \):

\[ \left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)^2 x_2 = 0 \]

This indicates that solving for \( x_2(t) \) follows a similar approach to the one used for \( x_1(t) \).

The text describes solving a system of differential equations by finding particular solutions. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The problem involves two related differential equations with expressions involving terms like \( \frac{4}{25} d x_2 \), \( \frac{4}{625} x_2 \), and others, resulting in an equation that simplifies to zero.

2. **Common Solutions**: The text notes that the characteristic roots for both equations are identical, implying similar solutions (denoted as \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \)) for each part of the system.

3. **Solution Formulation**:
   - For \( x_1(t) \), the solution involves terms like \( c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} \) and \( c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} \).
   - Similarly, for \( x_2(t) \), solutions involve \( c_3 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} \) and \( c_4 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} \).

4. **Linear System**: The system is linear, so coefficients can be expressed in terms of each other. The text sets up a substitution to express \( c_3 \) and \( c_4 \) using \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

5. **Derivation**:
   - By differentiating the expression for \( x_1(t) \), substituting into the differential equation, and simplifying, it derives relationships between coefficients.
   - The process involves multiplying through by a constant (50) to eliminate fractions, then grouping like terms.

6. **Coefficient Matching**: The final step is equating coefficients of similar exponential terms to zero, ensuring the solution holds for any \( t \).

This approach systematically finds specific solutions for the differential equations by leveraging their shared characteristics and solving for unknowns through substitution and simplification.

The text describes solving a system of equations involving exponential functions, likely related to an initial value problem in differential equations. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The author discusses setting up two equations where certain terms cannot be zero for any value of \( t \). This leads to the following conditions:
   - \(-2c_1 - c_3 = 0\)
   - \(-2c_2 - c_4 = 0\)

2. **Solving for Constants**:
   - From these, it's determined that \( c_3 = -2c_1 \) and \( c_4 = -2c_2 \).
   - Further, it is found that \( c_4 = 2c_2 \), leading to the conclusion that \( c_3 = 2c_1 \).

3. **Expression for Functions**:
   - The functions are expressed as:
     - \( x_1(t) = c_1 e^{-t/25} + c_2 e^{-3t/25} \)
     - \( x_2(t) = 2c_1 e^{-t/25} - 2c_2 e^{-3t/25} \)

4. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The initial conditions given are:
     - \( x_1(0) = 25 \)
     - \( x_2(0) = 0 \)

5. **Solving Initial Value Problem**:
   - Applying the initial conditions, the equations become:
     - \( c_1 + c_2 = 25 \)
     - \( 2c_1 - 2c_2 = 0 \)
   - Solving these, it is found that \( c_1 = c_2 = 12.5 \).

6. **Final Solutions**:
   - The solutions for the functions are:
     - \( x_1(t) = \frac{25}{2} e^{-t/25} + \frac{25}{2} e^{-3t/25} \)
     - \( x_2(t) = 25 e^{-t/25} - 25 e^{-3t/25} \)

The author notes the complexity and effort involved in solving such problems, mentioning it took several pages.

The text describes a process where one follows known steps repeatedly until reaching a solution. It emphasizes persistence in executing these familiar actions until the desired outcome is achieved.

The text describes the process of analyzing a system of linear differential equations, specifically using an example of salt water running in and out of a tank. It involves two independent variables (\(x_1\) and \(x_2\)) and their derivatives. The goal is to practice expressing these variables in different forms and solving the system.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the steps taken:

1. **Expressing Equations in Differential Form**:  
   - Equation 1: \(\frac{d}{dt} x_1 + \frac{2}{25}x_1 - \frac{1}{50}x_2 = 0\)
   - Equation 2: \(\frac{d}{dt} x_2 + \frac{2}{25}x_2 - \frac{2}{25}x_1 = 0\)

2. **Solving for \(x_2\) from Equation 2**:  
   - Rearrange to find \(x_2\) in terms of \(x_1\):  
     \[ x_2 = \frac{2}{25} \left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right) x_1 \]

3. **Substituting \(x_2\) into Equation 1**:  
   - Substitute the expression for \(x_2\) back into Equation 1:  
     \[ \left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right)x_1 - \frac{1}{50} \left(\frac{2}{25} \left(\frac{d}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}\right) x_1\right) = 0 \]

4. **Simplifying the Resulting Equation**:  
   - Simplify to form a polynomial-like equation in terms of \(x_1\) and its derivatives:  
     \[ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} x_1 + \frac{4}{25} \frac{d}{dt} x_1 + \left(\frac{4}{625} - \frac{1}{625}\right)x_1 = 0 \]

5. **Final Simplified Equation**:  
   - The simplified form is:  
     \[ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} x_1 + \frac{4}{25} \frac{d}{dt} x_1 + \frac{3}{625}x_1 = 0 \]

This process illustrates converting a system of linear differential equations into a single second-order differential equation by substitution and simplification.

The text describes the process of solving a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. The given ODE is:

\[ \frac{d^2x_1}{dt^2} + \frac{4}{25}\frac{dx_1}{dt} + \frac{3}{625}x_1 = 0. \]

This is a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients, and it can be solved using the auxiliary (or characteristic) equation:

\[ m^2 + \frac{4}{25}m + \frac{3}{625} = 0. \]

Solving this quadratic equation for \( m \), we use the quadratic formula:

\[ m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = \frac{4}{25} \), and \( c = \frac{3}{625} \). Calculating the discriminant:

\[ b^2 - 4ac = \left(\frac{4}{25}\right)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times \frac{3}{625} = \frac{16}{625} - \frac{12}{625} = \frac{4}{625}. \]

Thus, the roots are:

\[ m_1 = \frac{-\frac{4}{25} + \sqrt{\frac{4}{625}}}{2} = \frac{-\frac{4}{25} + \frac{2}{25}}{2} = -\frac{1}{25}, \]

\[ m_2 = \frac{-\frac{4}{25} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{625}}}{2} = \frac{-\frac{4}{25} - \frac{2}{25}}{2} = -\frac{3}{25}. \]

The general solution for \( x_1(t) \) is:

\[ x_1(t) = c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t}, \]

where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants determined by initial conditions.

Next, the text outlines solving for \( x_2(t) \). From a related system of equations, it is given that:

\[ \frac{dx_1}{dt} = \frac{1}{50}x_2. \]

Substituting \( x_1(t) \) into this equation and differentiating gives:

\[ \frac{d}{dt}\left(c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t}\right) = -\frac{c_1}{25}e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} - \frac{3c_2}{25}e^{-\frac{3}{25}t}. \]

Setting this equal to \( \frac{1}{50}x_2 \), and solving the resulting differential equation for \( x_2(t) \), leads to a similar form:

\[ \frac{d^2x_2}{dt^2} + \frac{4}{25}\frac{dx_2}{dt} + \frac{3}{625}x_2 = 0. \]

This has the same characteristic equation as for \( x_1(t) \), so its solution will also be of the form:

\[ x_2(t) = d_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + d_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t}, \]

where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are constants. The specific values depend on initial conditions or additional constraints provided in the problem.

The text discusses solving a system of differential equations involving two variables, \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). Here is a summary:

1. **Equations Setup**: We start with a quadratic form derived from the differential equations that both \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) satisfy:
   - The characteristic equation for these differential forms is: 
     \[
     d^2 x_2 + \frac{4}{25} dx_2 + \left(\frac{3}{625}\right)x_2 = 0
     \]

2. **Solving the Equation**: This quadratic form results in solutions involving exponential terms:
   - The roots of this equation lead to a solution for \( x_1 \) and similarly for \( x_2 \):
     \[
     x(t) = c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t}
     \]
   - For \( x_2 \), we introduce:
     \[
     x_2(t) = c_3 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + c_4 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t}
     \]

3. **Substitution and Simplification**: 
   - We differentiate \( x_1 \) with respect to time \( t \):
     \[
     \frac{dx_1}{dt} = -\frac{1}{25}c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} - \frac{3}{25}c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t}
     \]
   - Using the given equation, we substitute \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) into it:
     \[
     \frac{dx_1}{dt} + \frac{2}{25}x_1 - \frac{1}{50}x_2 = 0
     \]

4. **Solving for Constants**:
   - Multiply through by 50 to clear fractions:
     \[
     -2c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} - 6c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} + 4c_1 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + 4c_2 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} - c_3 e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} - c_4 e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} = 0
     \]
   - Group terms by their exponential factors:
     \[
     (2c_1 + c_3)e^{-\frac{1}{25}t} + (2c_2 + c_4)e^{-\frac{3}{25}t} = 0
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: For this equation to hold for all \( t \), the coefficients of each exponential term must individually equal zero:
   - \( 2c_1 + c_3 = 0 \)
   - \( 2c_2 + c_4 = 0 \)

This results in expressions for \( c_3 \) and \( c_4 \) in terms of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \):
- \( c_3 = -2c_1 \)
- \( c_4 = -2c_2 \) 

These relationships allow us to express the solution for \( x_2(t) \) entirely in terms of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), maintaining consistency with the solutions for \( x_1(t) \).

The text discusses solving a system of equations involving exponential terms with constants \( c_1, c_2, c_3, \) and \( c_4 \). The goal is to determine these constants based on the condition that certain expressions must equal zero. This leads to two equations: 

1. \( -2c_1 - c_3 = 0 \)
2. \( -2c_2 - c_4 = 0 \)

From these, it follows that:
- \( c_3 = 2c_1 \)
- \( c_4 = 2c_2 \)

The text then considers the functions \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \), which are expressed in terms of these constants and exponentials:

\[ 
x_1(t) = c_1 e^{-\frac{t}{25}} + c_2 e^{-\frac{3t}{25}}
\]
\[ 
x_2(t) = 2c_1 e^{-\frac{t}{25}} - 2c_2 e^{-\frac{3t}{25}}
\]

An initial value problem is used to solve for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), with the conditions:
- \( x_1(0) = 25 \)
- \( x_2(0) = 0 \)

Substituting these into the equations gives:
- \( c_1 + c_2 = 25 \)
- \( 2c_1 - 2c_2 = 0 \)

Solving these, it is found that \( c_1 = c_2 = \frac{25}{2} \).

Thus, the solutions are:
\[ 
x_1(t) = \frac{25}{2} e^{-\frac{t}{25}} + \frac{25}{2} e^{-\frac{3t}{25}}
\]
\[ 
x_2(t) = 25 e^{-\frac{t}{25}} - 25 e^{-\frac{3t}{25}}
\]

The text concludes by reflecting on the complexity and length of solving such problems.

The text describes a process where all necessary steps are known and only need to be repeatedly executed until reaching the solution. It emphasizes persistence in following established procedures without any new developments up to this point.
