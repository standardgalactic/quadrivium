Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that affects the thyroid gland or its regulatory mechanisms in the pituitary and hypothalamus, with higher prevalence among women, especially older ones. Symptoms' severity depends on the condition's extent and include metabolic issues like cold intolerance, weight gain due to water retention and decreased lipolysis, and increased cardiovascular risk from elevated LDL cholesterol and homocysteine.

Physiologically, patients may experience hyponatremia, reduced exercise tolerance, changes in blood pressure, ECG alterations, dry skin with non-pitting edema, and mental slowing. Autoimmune-related hypothyroidism can lead to pernicious anemia and gastric atrophy. In primary hypothyroidism, increased serum prolactin may affect fertility, while men might have reduced testosterone levels.

The text indicates that further discussion will explore the causes of hypothyroidism and subclinical cases.
