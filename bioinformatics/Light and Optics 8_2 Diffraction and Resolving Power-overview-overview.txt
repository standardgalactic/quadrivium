The provided text primarily discusses the concepts of diffraction and resolving power in relation to light passing through apertures like the eye or telescope lens. Here's a summary:

1. **Diffraction and Resolving Power**: Diffraction involves the bending of waves around obstacles, impacting our ability to distinguish between two objects. This resolving power depends on the wavelength of light (\(\lambda\)) and the aperture size (such as pupil diameter \(d\) or telescope lens).

2. **Rayleigh's Criterion**: A standard for determining when two point sources can be resolved, where they are considered resolvable if one source's central maximum aligns with the other's first minimum. The formula given is:
   \[
   \theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d}
   \]
   Here, \(\theta_{\text{min}}\) represents angular resolution, \(\lambda\) is light wavelength, and \(d\) is aperture diameter.

3. **Practical Example**: The text provides an example of a hang glider using green light (\(555 \text{ nm}\)) to determine the resolving power for humans and eagles from 120 meters up.

4. **Human vs. Eagle Vision**:
   - For humans with a pupil diameter of \(2.5 \text{ mm}\):
     \[
     \theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \frac{555 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}}{2.5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}}
     \]
   - The arc length for resolution on the ground is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Arc length} = \theta_{\text{min}} \times L
     \]
     where \(L\) is 120 meters.
   
   - Eagles, with a larger pupil diameter of \(6.5 \text{ mm}\), can resolve objects that are closer together due to their improved resolving power.

Overall, the text illustrates how wavelength and aperture size affect resolution using examples from human and eagle vision to demonstrate differences in resolving capabilities. The final part mentioning a bullet passing through an object seems unrelated to the primary discussion on diffraction and resolving power.
