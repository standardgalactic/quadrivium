We'll just have a quick discussion on x-rays and obviously in medicine we use x-rays quite a lot
and how are those x-ray photons generated? Well we have this metal plate
and depending upon what the type of metal plate is we're going to get different x-rays
or different wavelengths. We're going to have this stream of electrons hit that metal plate
and from this we're going to get the x-ray photons and we do this in an evacuated tube
and in that evacuated tube we are accelerating these electrons so we'll have this very hot element there
and we'll have a massive potential difference across this, accelerating the electrons up
to hit the aluminium or whatever it is and that will give us awesome x-rays
and if you look at the intensity per unit wavelength versus I think yeah the wavelength
you'll note these peaks, you'll note these peaks and then these peaks have got names
and what happens there is the electron hits in another electron in orbit around this aluminium nucleus
and it knocks it straight off, there is a gap there and that gap, so for instance we now have a gap in the K shell
and if I have one electron from the L shell falling down to the K shell that means there will be a photon that gets released
we've looked at the photoelectric effect before, this is something different that I've got an electron striking that electron
but certainly I now have a gap in one of my shells and I drop down from N equals 2 or N equals 3
I drop down from N equals 2 you'll get this one peak, from N equals 3 you'll get another characteristic peak
and it depends on what metal we use there, so if I say that I have photons of this x-ray wavelength
I want to know what velocity, what speed must this electron have, minimum speed to give me that wavelength
and that's quite easy to do in as much as if we just approximate things we know E equals HC divided by lambda
and if we're talking non-relativistic speeds we can just say that the energy that that electron then has
is just a half mv squared, it's just its kinetic energy causing that
in other words we'll have HC divided by lambda equals mv squared divided by 2
in other words v is going to be the square root of 2 HC divided by lambda m
and for me in this example, I know all these values, I know the mass of the electron
I get about 60.3 times 10 to the power 6 meters per second
ok, so that is what happens there
if I look at an example though, where I say I have aluminium, that means that z equals 78
and I want to know how much, oh let's do that in the next video
let's do the second problem, I want to know the minimum energy required of an electron to hit another electron
out of the orbit, in the k shell, in the k shell of aluminium there
and what we can do is just approximate things, this is how we do if we approximate it
we say that energy equals minus, remember 13.6 electron volts times z squared divided by n squared
so this is still, even though I'm talking about many many electrons here
I'm going to use the approximation of the Bohr model to do this
there is one change that I need to make for a better approximation
and that is the fact that in the k shell, n equals 1, I can have 2 electrons
so there's not 1 in that shell, but there are 2 electrons
and that makes a difference
what we say is there is 1 proton in the nucleus that sort of, let's call it, protects one of those electrons
so what we do for this approximation is, we're going to say that it's approximately equal to negative 13.6 electron volts
and we're going to have z minus 1 squared divided by n squared
so that's going to be 77 squared
and that gives me the energy required to knock that electron out of negative 8.1 times 10 to the power of 4 electron volts
and that means I need a potential difference across here of about 81,000 volts
to give me this kind of energy to knock out this one k shell electron
so in the previous example we looked at how much energy that electron must have
to give us a knockout of one of the electrons in the k
and we estimated that by using, by approximating and using the Bohr model for energy
now, if I use aluminium, I have, as I said, remember I said we have these characteristic peaks
and that is the peak and wavelength
and one of them is the k alpha line
and what happens there is I knock one of the n equals, n equals 1
one electron out of the k shell and one from the l shell, n equals 2, falls back
so my n initial, my electron initially, is going to equal me in the 2
and finally it's going to drop down to the 1
so in the previous example I looked at the amount of energy the electron must have to knock that out
and that will use the Bohr model for that for energy
now I want to know what this k alpha wavelength is going to be
if I use that amount of energy my electron now to knock out and one of them falls back
I'm again going to approximate this using the Bohr model
and remember that says that 1 over the wavelength is going to equal this Rydberg constant
times z squared and then times 1 over n, that was final squared minus 1 over n initial squared
ok, 1 minus that
so if I do that, the Lydberg constant
remember that was 1.097 times 10 to the power 7 inverse meters
and again, because of that protection by the proton
I am going to use the fact that the z that I'm going to use here is going to be 78 minus 1
Apologies, the card was full
I was about to say, yeah, we're going to use the 77 squared
we use the same approximation
and that leaves me a wavelength of
if you do that, 2.0 times 10 to the power negative 11 meters
negative 11 meters
so just to reiterate
to get the wavelength
I'm using an approximation of the Bohr model
just looking out for that
if I want the energy of the electron to knock it out of
say k equals 1
again, I'm going to use the Bohr model's equation for energy
and I'm also just going to subtract 1 from
from the atomic number z
now, I've mentioned this before
we get this characteristic
if we plot intensity per unit
wavelength and wavelength
we get these characteristic peaks
that should be k alpha
and k beta there
and you get this continuous spectrum
otherwise called
we call it brain, brain straddle
that is break radiation
this broad continued spectrum
due to the deceleration of the electron
as it hits
and that is due to
also to the metal that we use
and these peaks due to the metal that we use
but you'll see this very sharp
fall off there
this very sharp fall off
we call that lambda zero
and what this means is
the only energy that
the maximum amount of energy
that this electron can give
during this collision
is all of its kinetic energy
it can lose all of its kinetic energy
so I need to mention again
this is what we saw
due to the different
the falls in the different shells
from n equals 2 to n equals 1
n equals 3 to n equals 1
you get those
let's say for instance
I have a potential difference
of 45,000 volts
that is what I'm accelerating this on
so that will give me a kinetic energy
of 45,000 electron volts
and if I multiply that by 1.6 times 10 to the power
10 to the power negative 19 joules
divided by 1 electron volt
is 1 electron volt
I get that energy
I get that energy in joules
and if I remember that
if I give all of that over
I'm going to have that divided by
by
that equals that
in other words lambda
lambda equals
hc divided by e
and that is this e
that I have here now
converted to joules
and that will give me
that will give me
the smallest wavelength
here
the smallest wavelength
that will be the
maximum frequency
the maximum
strength
if I can call it strength
of
of this
exiler
the maximum
frequency
the smallest
wavelength
that will be the smallest
wavelength
I can have
if I make this
energy larger
by making this
potential difference
larger
then I'm going to have
an even smaller wavelength
higher frequency
more energetic
more energetic
because remember
that equals also hf
so
I'll have a more energetic
photon
in the
electromagnetic spectrum
so
let's look at this question
I have tube a and tube b
two different x-ray
machines
one uses copper
one uses silver
we see the atomic numbers
there
2947
and I
accelerate
electrons
to this
two
both at the same
potential difference
so
those electrons
are
the same
kinetic energy
I want to know
this cutoff
the ratio
of the cutoff
of these
and the ratio is going to be
y
why
because remember
that
this cutoff
wavelength
equals hc
divided by
e
and I'm giving them
both the same
because I'm using the same
potential difference
same mass
of electrons
are going to be
the same mass
in both
so I'm giving them
the same kinetic energy
half mb squared
and so
for both equations
h is going to be the same
c is going to be the same
e is going to be the same
so the ratio of these
is they're going to have
exactly the same
cutoff
so cutoff
wavelength
is independent
of
the type of
metal
that I use
this question asks
can I change
the potential difference
in my x-ray machines
such that I have
this
bremsstrahlung
but no characteristic
x-ray peaks at certain
wavelengths
and the answer is
yes I can
because
this bremsstrahlung
this background
whole spectrum
of wavelengths
that I give off
is due to
that
breaking
is brems
that bremsstrahlung
is breaking
comes from breaking
the deceleration
of those electrons
gives me
some
this background
of wavelengths
okay
so if I make
V
such that
I don't have
enough energy
to knock out
an electron
and then have
that gap
filled by an electron
from a higher orbit
falling down
to a lower orbit
that is
the x-ray peaks
that I see
this
is just due
to the deceleration
that had
kinetic energy
that electron
had now suddenly
decelerated
gives off
some of that
as this low
low amount
of
whole spectrum
of
wavelengths
in the
x-ray
in the
x-ray
side of the spectrum
so yes
if I make V
sufficiently small
but I don't have
those peaks
as many
in the
other
things
as it
will be
判断
slightly
copies of
other
bars
to the
face
and
unfortunately
it's
covered
but
there are
all
exceptions
to the
super
gate
