The text discusses techniques for analyzing functions of two variables to determine if they have a tangent plane at a given point by evaluating limits along specific paths or curves. The example function considered is \( z = f(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{x - y} \), with the domain being all real numbers \( (x, y) \) except where \( x = y \), as this would cause division by zero.

To find a tangent plane at the point \( (0, 0) \), the text explores constructing curves that pass through this point and lie within the function's domain. Two types of curves are considered:

1. **Curve along the x-axis**: Here, setting \( y = 0 \), it is shown that as \( (x, y) \to (0, 0) \), the limit evaluates to 1.
   
2. **Curve along a different line**: Setting \( x = 0 \) and evaluating another path like \( y \to 0 \), results in a limit of -1.

The differing limits obtained from these paths indicate that the limit does not exist at this point, meaning there is no tangent plane at \( (0, 0) \).

A second example function \( z = f(x, y) = \frac{x - y}{x + y} \) is also examined. The domain here excludes only the point \( (0, 0) \). Evaluating a curve where \( x = 0 \), it's found that the limit depends on the direction from which \( y \to 0 \): positive infinity if approaching from the negative side and negative infinity from the positive side. Thus, no tangent plane exists at \( (0, 0) \).

Overall, this analysis uses techniques from single-variable calculus within a multi-dimensional context to determine the existence of limits and consequently tangent planes for functions of two variables.
