The text discusses techniques for analyzing functions of two variables to determine if they have a tangent plane at a given point by evaluating limits along specific paths or curves. The example function considered is \( z = f(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{x - y} \), with the domain being all real numbers \( (x, y) \) except where \( x = y \), as this would cause division by zero.

To find a tangent plane at the point \( (0, 0) \), the text explores constructing curves that pass through this point and lie within the function's domain. Two types of curves are considered:

1. **Curve along the x-axis**: Here, setting \( y = 0 \), it is shown that as \( (x, y) \to (0, 0) \), the limit evaluates to 1.
   
2. **Curve along a different line**: Setting \( x = 0 \) and evaluating another path like \( y \to 0 \), results in a limit of -1.

The differing limits obtained from these paths indicate that the limit does not exist at this point, meaning there is no tangent plane at \( (0, 0) \).

A second example function \( z = f(x, y) = \frac{x - y}{x + y} \) is also examined. The domain here excludes only the point \( (0, 0) \). Evaluating a curve where \( x = 0 \), it's found that the limit depends on the direction from which \( y \to 0 \): positive infinity if approaching from the negative side and negative infinity from the positive side. Thus, no tangent plane exists at \( (0, 0) \).

Overall, this analysis uses techniques from single-variable calculus within a multi-dimensional context to determine the existence of limits and consequently tangent planes for functions of two variables.

The text provides examples of evaluating whether tangent planes exist for certain functions at specific points by constructing curves through those points and examining the limits along these curves.

1. **Function and Domain**: The function \( z = f(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{x - y} \) is defined such that its domain includes all \( (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) except where \( x = y \), because this would make the denominator zero.

2. **Tangent Plane at Point (0, 0)**: The text explores whether a tangent plane can exist at the point (0, 0). It attempts to construct curves passing through (0, 0) and evaluate limits as these curves approach the origin.
   
   - A curve \( y = 0 \) is considered. As \( x \to 0 \), the limit of \( f(x, 0) = \frac{x}{x} = 1 \).
   
   - Another curve \( x = 0 \) is used. Here, as \( y \to 0 \), the limit of \( f(0, y) = \frac{y}{-y} = -1 \).

   The limits along these curves are different (1 and -1), indicating that the overall limit does not exist at (0, 0). Therefore, a tangent plane cannot be defined there.

3. **Second Example**: A new function \( z = f(x, y) = \frac{x - y}{x + y} \) is considered with the domain excluding points where both \( x \) and \( y \) are zero.

   - Using the curve \( x = 0 \), as \( y \to 0 \), the limit of \( f(0, y) = \frac{-y}{y^2} = \frac{-1}{y} \).
   
   - The limit depends on the direction from which \( y \) approaches zero: from the negative side, it tends to positive infinity; from the positive side, it tends to negative infinity.

   Since these directional limits are not equal, the overall limit does not exist at (0, 0). Thus, no tangent plane exists there either.

The examples illustrate that for a tangent plane to exist at a point, the limit of the function must be the same regardless of the path taken to approach the point. If different paths yield different limits, or if any path leads to an undefined limit, the tangent plane does not exist.
