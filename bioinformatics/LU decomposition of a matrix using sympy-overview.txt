The text explains how to perform LU decomposition on a matrix using Python with the SymPy library. The process involves importing only the necessary function (`matrix`) from SymPy and setting up pretty printing for clear output. The author demonstrates creating a 3x3 matrix and performing LU decomposition, which separates the original matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), without row swapping.

The main steps include:
1. Importing necessary functions from SymPy.
2. Creating a sample 3x3 matrix.
3. Performing LU decomposition using the `lu` method available for SymPy's matrix object, which returns L, U, and permutation matrix P.
4. Displaying the upper triangular matrix (U) with zeros below its main diagonal and the lower triangular matrix (L) with ones on its main diagonal.
5. Verifying the decomposition by multiplying L and U to see if it reconstructs the original matrix.

The author emphasizes the simplicity of performing these operations in SymPy, highlighting its capabilities for handling matrices elegantly.
