The text discusses the fundamental theorem of line integrals, drawing a parallel to the fundamental theorem of calculus in single-variable calculus, which connects integration and differentiation. In multivariable calculus, particularly when dealing with vector fields, the focus shifts to understanding these concepts within the framework of line integrals.

The central idea is that if you have a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) that is the gradient of some scalar function \( f \), i.e., \( \nabla f = \mathbf{F} \), then \( \mathbf{F} \) is termed a conservative vector field. A key property of conservative vector fields is path independence: the line integral between two points depends only on those points, not on the path taken.

The fundamental theorem for line integrals states that if you compute the line integral of a conservative vector field \( \mathbf{F} = \nabla f \) along a curve from point \( a \) to point \( b \), the result is simply the difference in the values of the scalar function at these points: 

\[
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = f(b) - f(a)
\]

This theorem implies that, for conservative fields, calculating work (or other related physical quantities modeled by line integrals) depends only on the endpoints of the path and not the specific trajectory. 

Additionally, the curve \( C \) over which this integration is performed can be piecewise smooth; it doesn't have to be smooth everywhere as long as each segment is smooth enough for integration. The entire curve must lie within the domain where the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is defined.

Overall, this theorem helps simplify calculations in physics and engineering by reducing complex path-dependent integrals into simple evaluations of scalar functions at boundary points.
