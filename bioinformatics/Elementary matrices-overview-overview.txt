Here's a summary of the process described in your text for solving systems of linear equations using elementary matrices:

### Overview:
The method involves transforming the coefficient matrix into reduced row echelon form (RREF) by applying elementary row operations, each corresponding to an elementary matrix multiplication. This approach systematically solves linear equation systems.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Start with a System:**
   - Example system of equations:
     \[
     4x - 2y = 6
     \]
     \[
     y = 1
     \]

2. **Matrix Representation:**
   - Convert the system into an augmented matrix:
     \[
     A|b = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Elementary Matrices and Operations:**
   - Each row operation is linked to an elementary matrix \( E_i \).

4. **Row Transformations:**

   - **Normalize the First Row:** 
     - Multiply by \( \frac{1}{4} \) (elementary matrix \( E_3 \)):
       \[
       E_3 = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{4} & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
       \]
     - Resulting in:
       \[
       \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{3}{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
       \]

   - **Eliminate the \( y \)-term in the First Equation:**
     - Add \( \frac{1}{2} \) times the second row to the first (elementary matrix \( E_4 \)):
       \[
       E_4 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
       \]
     - Resulting in:
       \[
       \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
       \]

5. **Solution:**
   - The system is now in RREF, yielding:
     \[
     x = 2, \quad y = 1
     \]

### Key Points:

- **Elementary Matrices:** Correspond to specific row operations on the identity matrix.
  
- **Types of Row Operations:**
  - Scaling a row by a non-zero scalar.
  - Adding a multiple of one row to another.
  - Swapping two rows.

- **Order of Operations:** Sequential application is crucial as each step builds upon the previous one.

### Practice and Future Topics:
Practicing these steps with various systems enhances understanding and accuracy. The text also hints at the importance of such exercises for exam preparation, mentioning future discussions on LU decomposition and further applications of elementary matrices.

The text suggests a focus on using elementary matrices to explore advanced topics like matrix inversion and decompositions in upcoming sessions.
