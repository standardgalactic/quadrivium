This video series explores fundamental fluid mechanics concepts, focusing on density and pressure. 

- **Density** is described as mass per unit volume (kg/m³), with examples like air (~1.21 kg/m³), water at 20°C (~998 kg/m³), and seawater (~1,024 kg/m³).

- **Pressure** is force per unit area (N/m² or Pascals). Related units include 1 atmosphere (\(1.01 \times 10^5\) Pascals) and 1 torr (1 mm of mercury).

The series stresses understanding these concepts over rote memorization, noting the continued medical use of "millimeters of mercury" despite other recommended terminology in textbooks.
