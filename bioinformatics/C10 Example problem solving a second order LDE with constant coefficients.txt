There we go, a linear equation, homogeneous, ordinary, and second order, linear.
So from am squared plus bm plus c equals zero, our auxiliary equation,
we get the roots of that, which is going to be m equals minus, or negative b,
so that's going to be 10 plus minus the square root of 10 squared.
Let me just see if I wrote this problem correctly.
I'm not so sure I did this one correctly.
Let's just have a look.
Is it negative 10 plus 25?
Let's just see, I can't remember if that was the grade by b squared.
In any way, that's going to be 100, minus 4 times 1 times 25, that is negative 100.
So we're in one of those cases where m1 is going to equal m2 divided by 2a, which is just 2.
So m sub 1 equals m sub 2 is going to equal 5.
It's going to equal 5.
I think, suppose we could have just had m squared minus 10m plus 25 equals 0.
It's very easy to see that it's going to be m minus 5, m minus 5 equals 0.
As far as the roots are concerned, negative 25 times negative 25 is positive.
Negative 5 times negative 5 is positive.
And minus 5m minus 5m is minus 10m.
Okay.
So we will remember that if those two are equal,
we're going to have the fact that we're going to have y equals c sub 1 e to the power m1x
plus c2x e to the power m sub 1x.
That's something that you should remember.
And that means that we're going to have y equals c sub 1 e to the power 5x
plus c sub 2 x e to the power 5x.
This is going to be our answer.
This is going to be our answer.
