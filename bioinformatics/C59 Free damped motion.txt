So let's have a look at damped motion now. And what we're going to do is introduce a
retarding force proportional to velocity. A retarding force proportional to velocity.
And think about it this spring moves up and down but as it moves up there's something that retards
its movement whether that be air resistance and that's or resistance in the spring whatever
it's going to go slower slower slower slower. So we're going to introduce this constant of
proportionality we're going to call a beta and we're going to consider to be opposed to the
direction of the velocity as it goes up obviously the friction air friction is on the opposite side
of velocity. So if we look at the second order differential equation we're going to add
first we just had that with free oscillation we're going to add negative beta x prime
to this equation just denoting that it is opposed to the velocity minus the velocity.
So I bring it all over to one side and to make the solution solutions easier I'm going to let beta
over m I've just divided by m throughout as well I'm going to let beta over m be 2 lambda just
introducing this lambda and still k over m as omega squared that leaves me with x double prime
plus 2 lambda x prime plus omega squared x equals zero and y can write it in differential form.
Now from this I can write the auxiliary equation because it's homogeneous and I can have three
possible outcomes if the roots are real and distinct we're going to call that overdamped.
If they're real and equal we're going to call it critically damped and if they're complex we're
going to call it under damped. Let's have a look. So this is our homogeneous equation we're going to
it's a quadratic equation we're going to solve it in this fashion and if we just plug the values in
we're going to get the solution for m minus lambda plus minus the square root of lambda squared minus
omega squared. So let's look at case one where it's overdamped. In other words this is going to be
larger than zero which means m sub one is going to be negative lambda plus and m sub two negative
lambda minus that which leaves us with c sub one e to the power now it's e to the power m sub one t and
e to the power m sub two t so i've just got to distribute t in there as well and if i rewrite
all of this it's a bit small there i hope you can see it's a bit small there pause and do it for
yourself if i bring e to the power negative lambda t out as a common factor i'm going to be left with
this some well not simple rather long equation c sub one e to the power the square root of lambda squared
minus omega squared t plus c sub two e to the power negative the square root of this times t
if the two roots are equal we're going to call it critically damped our case two m sub one equals
m sub two and that's negative lambda because the square root is now zero that leaves us with c sub one
e to the power negative lambda t and c sub two t e to the power negative lambda t if i once again bring
this out i'm left with c sub one plus c sub two t easy and then under damped where we now have a bit
small again i hope you could see that one so it's just m sub one equals m sub two leaving me with this
extra t i have to put in there and i've just taken e to the power negative lambda out now case three is a
bit more difficult and i'm going to have that the square root equals negative uh there's going to be a
negative and uh of the square root uh lambda squared minus omega squared is less than zero so m sub one
and m sub two is now going to look slightly different i think um that that uh what that little i is doing
there but what you can see is the fact that um i what you can see is the fact that um when you do solve
this note that becomes omega squared minus lambda squared the other way around when you do solve these
so alpha is negative omega and my beta is square root of omega squared minus lambda squared so that
leaves me with the c sub one cosine of that t and c sub two the sine of that times t just note
so that's the fact is the fact that uh how to not calculate how to solve for this complex number
how to solve for this complex number
how to solve for this complex number
how to solve for this complex number
how to solve for this complex number
