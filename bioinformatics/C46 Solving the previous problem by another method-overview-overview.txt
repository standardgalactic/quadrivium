The text outlines a mathematical process for solving a differential equation through substitution and specific techniques. Hereâ€™s a detailed summary:

1. **Substitution**: The transformation involves substituting \( t = \ln(x) \), which implies \( x = e^t \). This changes the function \( y(x) \) into a function of \( t \), denoted as \( y(t) \).

2. **Derivatives Transformation**:
   - The first derivative \( y' \) becomes \( \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{1}{e^t} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt} \).
   - The second derivative \( y'' \) transforms to \( \frac{1}{x^2} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \frac{dy}{dt} \right) = \frac{1}{e^{2t}} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \frac{dy}{dt} \right) \).

3. **Differential Equation Transformation**: The original equation \( y'' - 2y' + y = 2x \) becomes:
   \[
   y''(t) - 2y'(t) + y(t) = 2e^t
   \]

4. **Solution Approach**:
   - Solve the homogeneous part using the auxiliary equation \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (m-1)^2 = 0 \). This gives a repeated root, leading to solutions of the form \( y_c(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t \).
   - For the particular solution \( y_p(t) \), use the annihilator method. The non-homogeneous term \( 2e^t \) suggests a trial solution of \( at^2 e^t \).

5. **Particular Solution**:
   - Substituting \( y_p(t) = at^2 e^t \) into the differential equation and solving for \( a \), it is found that \( a = 1 \).
   - Thus, \( y_p(t) = t^2 e^t \).

6. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution in terms of \( t \) is \( y(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t + t^2 e^t \).

7. **Back Substitution**: To express the solution back in terms of \( x \):
   - Replace \( e^t \) with \( x \).
   - Replace \( t \) with \( \ln(x) \).

8. **Final Solution**:
   - The final expression for \( y(x) \) is:
     \[
     y(x) = c_1 x + c_2 \ln(x) \cdot x + (\ln(x))^2 \cdot x
     \]

Additionally, the text describes a simplification process involving an expression related to \( t^2 \), specifically "natural log of \( x^2 \) times \( e \)" raised to the power of the natural log of \( x \). This is simplified as follows:

1. The expression involves \( c = c_1 \cdot e^{\ln(x)} \), which simplifies to \( c = x + c_2 \cdot x \ln(x) + x \ln(x^2) \).
2. Further simplification results in \( x + c_2 \cdot x \ln(x) + 2x \ln(x) \).

The result matches a previously obtained answer using a different method, confirming the consistency of the solution.
