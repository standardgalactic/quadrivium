The text describes a physics problem involving the calculation of an electron's de Broglie wavelength after being accelerated through a potential difference. Here's a summary:

1. **Electron Acceleration and Energy**: An electron is accelerated through a 418-volt potential difference, gaining kinetic energy equal to 418 electron volts (eV). This energy is converted into joules using the conversion factor \(1 \text{ eV} = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}\).

2. **Kinetic Energy and Velocity**: The kinetic energy (\(KE\)) of the electron is given by \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \(m\) is the mass and \(v\) is the velocity. Since the velocities involved are non-relativistic (less than 0.1c, where \(c\) is the speed of light), relativistic equations are unnecessary.

3. **Calculation of Velocity**: The velocity (\(v\)) can be derived from the equation \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = eV \) (where \(e\) is the charge of an electron and \(V\) is the potential difference). Solving for \(v\) gives \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}} \).

4. **de Broglie Wavelength**: The de Broglie wavelength (\(\lambda\)) is calculated using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{h}{mv} \), where \(h\) is Planck's constant. Substituting for \(v\) from the previous step gives the final expression for \(\lambda\).

5. **Result**: The electron's de Broglie wavelength after acceleration through 418 volts is approximately 16.1 picometers.

The text also briefly describes a separate problem involving a totally inelastic collision between two particles, A and B. In this scenario:

- Particle B strikes stationary particle A, and they move together post-collision.
- Conservation of momentum applies: initial momentum of B equals final momentum of the combined mass (A+B).
- The de Broglie wavelength before and after the collision remains unchanged because it depends on momentum, which is conserved.

In summary, the text covers calculating an electron's de Broglie wavelength post-acceleration and discusses momentum conservation in a totally inelastic collision scenario.
