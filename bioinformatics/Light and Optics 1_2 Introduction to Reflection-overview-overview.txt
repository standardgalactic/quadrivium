The text introduces key concepts and equations related to spherical mirrors in optics, focusing on conventions and calculations pertinent to concave and convex mirrors:

1. **Distance Conventions**:
   - Object distance is positive when the object is in front of the mirror.
   - Image distance is positive for real images and negative for virtual images.

2. **Mirror Parameters**:
   - Radius of curvature (\( R \)) is positive for convex mirrors and negative for concave mirrors.
   - The focal length (\( F \)) is related to \( R \) by the equation \( F = -\frac{R}{2} \).

3. **Equations**:
   - Mirror equation: \(\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = -\frac{2}{R}\) or equivalently \(\frac{1}{F}\).
   - Transverse magnification is calculated as \( M = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} \), which also relates image height to object height.

The text further explains how plane mirrors can form multiple images and outlines the necessary steps for determining the minimum size and placement of a mirror for full-body visibility. For a person standing three meters from a mirror:

- **Positioning**: The mirror should be placed so that their image appears at the same distance.
  
- **Ray Diagrams**: Essential for understanding how light travels from different body parts (feet and eyes) to the mirror.

- **Mirror Size Calculation**:
  - Vertical positioning: The bottom edge of the mirror must be 70 centimeters above the floor for visibility of feet.
  - Mirror length: A total of 75 centimeters is required, ensuring both top and bottom of the body are visible.

The conclusion emphasizes that a mirror positioned 70 centimeters from the ground with a length of 75 centimeters allows full-body visibility when standing three meters away. The explanation concludes by appreciating the clarity of these concepts.
