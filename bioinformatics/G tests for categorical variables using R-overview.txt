This tutorial introduces two alternatives to the chi-square test for categorical variables: the g-test. Specifically, it covers the g-test for goodness of fit and the g-test of independence.

1. **G-Test for Goodness of Fit**: This test compares observed frequencies of a single categorical variable against expected frequencies, similar to the chi-square goodness of fit test but using a different statistical formula.

2. **G-Test of Independence**: Similar to the chi-squared test of independence, this version assesses whether two categorical variables are independent by comparing their joint distribution to what would be expected if they were indeed independent, utilizing the g-statistic rather than the chi-square statistic.

The tutorial demonstrates how to implement these tests using R and the `desk tools` library. It includes examples with fictional data:
- For goodness of fit: Observed counts (175 and 90) are compared against an expected 50-50 split.
- For independence: A contingency table example is used, highlighting how results differ slightly from the chi-square test due to using the g-statistic.

The tutorial also mentions where to find additional resources for these R tutorials—on RPubs for rendered HTML files and on GitHub for raw files—and encourages viewers to subscribe and follow for more content.

The text provides an overview of using G-tests as alternatives to the chi-square tests for analyzing categorical variables in statistical analysis. The tutorial introduces two types of G-tests: 

1. **G-test for Goodness of Fit**: Similar to the chi-square goodness of fit test, it assesses whether observed frequencies of a single categorical variable match expected frequencies. An example is provided where observed counts (175 and 90) are compared against an expected 50-50 distribution using R's `desk tools` library.

2. **G-test for Independence**: Analogous to the chi-square test of independence, it evaluates if two categorical variables are independent by examining their joint frequency distribution. The tutorial illustrates this with a matrix representation in R, resulting in a statistically significant difference indicated by a p-value of 0.01.

The text emphasizes that while the calculations differ slightly from chi-square tests (using a G-statistic instead), the conceptual framework remains similar.
