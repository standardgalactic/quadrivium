This tutorial introduces two alternatives to the chi-square test for categorical variables: the g-test. Specifically, it covers the g-test for goodness of fit and the g-test of independence.

1. **G-Test for Goodness of Fit**: This test compares observed frequencies of a single categorical variable against expected frequencies, similar to the chi-square goodness of fit test but using a different statistical formula.

2. **G-Test of Independence**: Similar to the chi-squared test of independence, this version assesses whether two categorical variables are independent by comparing their joint distribution to what would be expected if they were indeed independent, utilizing the g-statistic rather than the chi-square statistic.

The tutorial demonstrates how to implement these tests using R and the `desk tools` library. It includes examples with fictional data:
- For goodness of fit: Observed counts (175 and 90) are compared against an expected 50-50 split.
- For independence: A contingency table example is used, highlighting how results differ slightly from the chi-square test due to using the g-statistic.
