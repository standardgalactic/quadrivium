Now we have to move on to the much more interesting higher order equations using
fourth order rangakata. As with the Euler let me remind you and again I'm doing this right here
using my Python shell. Well actually this is not the shell. I've opened I said file a new file
and this is the file I'm working on. So here we go we have a Y double prime as some function
containing X Y and Y prime. We see it there. Remember I put these little hashtags there
that would be shift 3 on the keyboard just to tell Python that this is a comment a human comment
and Python will just ignore in that line whatever comes after this hashtag. So if I just look at my
example down here I have Y double prime plus X Y prime plus Y equals zero and it's an initial value
problem. Note that though there's a Y double prime in there and a Y prime. So if I just simple
algebra bring these two to the other side of the equation sign we're going to have Y double prime
that is our function there. Y double prime is a function of X Y and Y prime and lo and behold
there's an X there a Y and a Y prime. That's what we mean by second order. We're going to solve this
creating two first order equations by bringing in this new function U and letting it be equal to Y prime
such that Y double prime now becomes U prime and that is now a function of X Y and U. Remember U being
Y prime so there's just that U equals Y prime now. We're also going to remember that we're just going
to increment our X and let me just remember that and this is Euler remember for Euler but just just to
remember that I want to move along the X axis and I want to move along the Y axis
and this is how it's going to work. Because I now have two first order equations I have Y prime and U prime
I have to now get a function for Y and a function for U and I'm going to do it by stepping along a
certain step size and Y of N plus 1 is going to be Y sub N plus 1 I should say is Y sub N plus
a weighted average and it's going to be H divided by 6 of these values M sub 1 M sub 2 M sub 3 M sub 4
such that I have this twice M sub 2 and twice M sub 3 there makes it a weighted average and I have to
divide by 6 and I must not forget that I also have U sub N plus 1 now which equals U sub N plus again
H divided by 6 times this so divided by 6 of this K sub 1 times twice K sub 2 twice K sub 3 and K sub 4
again a weighted average. Now with that information I've got to tell you what M sub 1 until M sub 4 and K sub 1
is it is such that these two equations are such that M sub 1 equals U sub N M sub 2 is U sub N so the previous U
plus H over 2 times K sub 1. So in order for me to move on to M sub 2 I need to know what K sub 1 is so I have to jump all the way to K sub 1 and K sub 1 tells me it is just a function that M sub 2 is
I need to know what K sub 1 is so I have to jump all the way to K sub 1 is just a function of X sub N Y sub N and U sub N
in other words it is this new function that I created that contains U so I need that before I can do M sub 2
to do M sub 3 I have to know M K sub 2 there is K sub 2 to do K sub 2 I need to know M sub 1 fortunately which I already have
which is up there so you can very clearly see it's easy to memorize these what M sub 1 M sub 2 M sub 3 M sub 4 is
this is U sub N all the time plus H over 2 times K sub 1 H over 2 K sub 2 K sub 3 and to remember what K sub 1
through K sub 4 should be you can just just memorize it then but what you very clearly note is that you can't do
all the M's in theory and then do all the K's because M sub 2 depends on the value of K sub 1 so you'll have to do M sub 1
then K sub 1 then M2 then but to do M2 you need K1 so then do K1 then you do M3 but for M3 you need K2 so you do K sub 2
then you go to M4 but for M4 you need K3 so therefore you do K3 so you'll have to go back and forth
another thing you have to note is say let's look at K sub 2 K sub 2 there's a certain value you're going to use this function
F the F of X sub N Y sub N U sub N but you need very specific values of X and it's going to be the previous X plus half times the step size
times M1 and for U sub N for U to plug that into K sub 2 you're going to need U sub N plus H over 2 times K sub 1
just very quickly look at that U sub N plus H over 2 times K sub 1 where have we seen that before
well that's nothing other than way up here that's M sub 2 so I can actually just make life easier for myself
let's put in M sub 2 and I'm denoting sub by these little square brackets
look at K sub 3 it's going to you're going to use your new function your F of X Y N U
and inside of that you're going to have this value for X so you have to do that first
you have to get a value for X this value you have to get this value for Y and you have to get this value for U
but again where did we see this before oh oh look at that that seems to be to me to be nothing other than
where would that be that seems to be nothing other than U sub N plus there we go U sub N plus H over 2 K sub 2
that's M sub 3 so I can just rewrite this as M sub 3 just making my life easier I don't have to recalculate
calculate those things so just think about doing K sub 1 it's very easy because you're just going to
the function that you were given the example problem just plug in X sub 0 Y sub 0 U sub 0
and U sub 0 is Y prime sub 0 remember then to get K2 you'll have to first have this get this value
and you'll have to call it something other than X in my instance I call it X sub 2 and calculate that first
then calculate Y sub 2 and then calculate U sub 2 but we don't need U sub 2 it's this M sub 2 as before
now you have those values and now you have to plug it into my F of X sub N Y sub N U sub N and then get that
let's make life a bit easier through an example so we have Y double prime plus XY prime plus Y equals 0
and this initial value problem in as much as if X is 0 Y is 2 and if X is 0 Y prime or U is 2
first of all create two equations first one was always going to be U equals Y prime that makes so what
you have to do you have to get Y double prime on its own so I'm taking these to the other side this is
now a function of XY and Y prime but remember Y prime is nothing other than U and U prime is nothing other
than Y double prime so these two are equal that's negative X times U which is Y prime minus U so to
do this is really easy now I'm starting to write code my X value initially is 0 when X is 0 Y is 2
and U is 2 I put the point 0 because I want floating point operations here I don't want integers so U is
nothing other than remember Y prime and my step size is 0.05 remember this backslash N just means
carriage return hitting enter for new line and I'm doing that 40 times that's just something to clean up
the shell then I want to print X and Y as two integers I've put it in these quotation marks double quotation
marks I could also have used single quotation marks but then I have to use single quotation marks
throughout then I wanted to print the value of X and Y at the moment X is 0 and Y is 2 now we
want to run through a while loop and you have to keep it together here we're going to run through it until
X is less than 0.25 remember we're starting X at 0 so while this is happening I put it in little parentheses
parentheses and after that I put a colon which means all of this underneath will be indented that
means this forms part of a loop and we'll continue going into the loop and up until X reaches 0.25 and
then we'll exit the loop so what is my first first I need to get M1 there we go I have to get M1 and I
see M1 is just U sub n so M1 is just U what it is at the moment U at the moment is 2.
To get K sub 1 remember what K sub 1 was it's just a function of X sub 0 Y sub 0 U sub 0 which is here
there it is negative X times U minus Y that's what it is so it's negative X times U minus Y the K1 version of
this function now we'll do M sub 2 we've done M sub 1 K sub 1 now we move on to M sub 2 M sub 2 is
still relatively easy it's just U sub n which is the U that we have at the moment plus a half times the
step size times K sub 1 we've just done K sub 1 now though we see we can't just do K sub 2 before we do K sub 2
here we have to develop values for X for Y and for U and fortunately we've seen U is very easy to get
we've already done U but I have to call them something new so I'm just calling them X underscore 2 it's a new
variable and it's going to be X plus half of the step size Y underscore 2 as Y plus half of the step size times M1
M1 the M1 that we've just done and U sub 2 we know now is M sub 2 now I can do K sub 2 and in the place of
X I put this new variable that I've just gotten X underscore 2 instead of U I put in U underscore 2 and instead
of Y I put Y underscore 2 it's Y underscore 2 you can name it whatever you want as long as you don't name it
X Y and Z because it's not X Y and Z you want to plug into this equation here you want to plug in
these variables that you had to calculate before you put them into the function F and the same is going to
happen to K3 first of all you have to develop X sub 3 Y sub 3 and U sub 3 then you can plug it into the F of
X Y and U and same goes for X sub 4 Y sub 4 X underscore 4 Y underscore 4 U underscore 4 before you plug it into
the F of X Y and U and there you go now at the end of the loop I want X sub n plus 1 so what does the
computer code do what is X at the moment at 0 what is the step size 0.1 so the new X value before we go into
the loop now is going to be 0.01 is it less than 0.25 yes it is so we can run straight through again
with the newest value of X and the newest value of Y and the newest value of U and what is Y well it's
H Y the old Y which came into this loop I didn't use Y anyway in this loop so it's still outside here is 2
plus H over 6 times M1 twice M2 twice M3 and M4 and I need U right in the beginning so I need to bring
a new U in there so there's my U H over 6 case K1 twice K2 twice K3 and K4 I want to print the new
values of X and Y they now go into the loop as the old X and Y so that I can do X sub n plus 1 and Y sub n plus 1
using the old values that now enter the loop again so let's say file save and all we're going
to do now is we're just going to say run run the module we get a few blank lines and there we go
so Y of 0 Y of 0 when X is 0 Y is 2 we know that when it's 0.05 it's 2.097 when it's X is 0.1
it's 2.18 0.15 0.2 and we see exactly where these values go plotting for X and Y X and Y X and Y X and Y X and Y
so that's beautiful now remember to exit all I'm going to write is exit and open close parentheses
that's going to say this program is still running you want to kill it okay and we're back so that we can edit
so you can plug in any second order ordinary differential equation here as it stands with these constant coefficients
coefficients and what we can do all you have to do is just to change just to change these case of one case of two
case of three and case of four you just have to change those equations to whatever the problem was
remember our problem was Y double prime plus XY prime plus Y equals 0 with initial values
you just have to convert it to this so that this is what you plug into
case of one case of two case of three case of four remembering that case of two case of three case of four
requires their own unique X Y and new values
course next question
you
