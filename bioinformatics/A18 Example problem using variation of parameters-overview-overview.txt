The text outlines a method for solving a system of non-homogeneous linear differential equations using the variation of parameters technique, focusing on both complementary (homogeneous) and particular solutions. Here's an organized summary:

1. **Introduction**: The objective is to solve a system of non-homogeneous linear differential equations by employing the variation of parameters method. This involves deriving both complementary and particular solutions.

2. **Complementary Solution**:
   - Start with the homogeneous version of the equation by setting \( f(t) = 0 \).
   - Use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to derive the complementary solution.
   - Construct the matrix \( A - \lambda I \), where \( A \) is a square matrix, and \( \lambda \) represents eigenvalues.
   - Calculate the determinant of this matrix, set it to zero, and solve for eigenvalues (\( \lambda_1 = -2 \) and \( \lambda_2 = -5 \)).
   - Determine eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues, leading to constants \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \).
   - Formulate the complementary solution: \( x_c(t) = c_1 e^{-2t} + c_2 (1, -2)e^{-5t} \).

3. **Fundamental Matrix**:
   - Construct a fundamental matrix from the complementary solutions.
   - The fundamental matrix is formed by combining solutions to the homogeneous equation and is expressed as:
     \[
     X(t) = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     e^{-2t} & e^{-5t} \\
     e^{-2t} & -2e^{-5t}
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

4. **Inverse of the Fundamental Matrix**:
   - Calculate the inverse of the fundamental matrix, which is necessary for determining the particular solution.
   - The determinant of \( X(t) \) aids in computing its inverse.

The text stops at this point to tidy up before proceeding to find the particular solution using the inverse of the fundamental matrix. It also involves working with matrices and exponential functions within the context of solving differential equations using matrix methods. Further steps include:

1. **Matrix Operations and Exponential Functions**: Simplifying expressions involving exponentials to obtain a scalar (e.g., \(-3\)).

2. **Inverse Matrix Calculation**: Using the scalar in finding an inverse matrix, yielding terms like \( \frac{2}{3} e^{2t} \).

3. **Multiplication with Function \( f(t) \)**: Multiplying the inverse matrix by a function \( f(t) = 3t e^{-t} \), resulting in a new 2x1 matrix.

4. **Integration**: Integrating the resultant 2x1 matrix, applying techniques such as integration by parts (product rule).

5. **Product Rule Application**: For expressions like \( 2t e^{2t} \), apply the product rule for integration:
   - Let \( u = 2t \) and \( dv = e^{2t} dt \).
   - Then \( du = 2 \) and integrating \( dv \) gives \( v = \frac{1}{2} e^{2t} \).

6. **Integration Result**: The integration of \( 2t e^{2t} \) using the product rule results in:
   \[
   t e^{2t} - \frac{1}{2} e^{2t}
   \]

The text concludes by indicating that matrix multiplication with a resultant 2x1 matrix from integration is lengthy, suggesting it as an exercise for further exploration. This process involves integrating functions within matrices in a structured manner.
