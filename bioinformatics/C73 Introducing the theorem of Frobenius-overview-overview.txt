The text outlines the use of Frobenius' method for solving second-order differential equations that have regular singular points. The core idea is to find a series expansion for the function \( y \) around a singularity at \( x_0 \), expressed as:

\[ 
y = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n (x - x_0)^{n+r}
\]

where \( r \) is a constant determined later, and \( C_n \) are the coefficients of the series. The method modifies the standard power series approach by including an additional factor of \( (x - x_0)^r \), which accounts for the singularity.

Key steps in Frobenius' method include:

1. **Series Formulation**: Expressing the solution as a power series multiplied by \( (x - x_0)^r \).

2. **Derivatives**: Calculating derivatives, where:
   - The first derivative involves terms like \( (n + r)(x - x_0)^{n + r - 1} \).
   - The second derivative includes terms such as \( (n + r)(n + r - 1)(x - x_0)^{n + r - 2} \).

3. **Initial Conditions**: Starting the series from \( n = 0 \) due to the presence of \( (x - x_0)^r \).

4. **Solving for Coefficients**: Iteratively determining the coefficients \( C_n \), often in relation to initial ones like \( C_0 \) and \( C_1 \).

5. **Determining \( r \)**: Solving an indicial equation to find the value of \( r \), which is crucial for shaping the solution.

The text intends to further illustrate these concepts with examples, particularly focusing on cases where the singularity point \( x_0 = 0 \).
