The provided text describes a method for finding the center of mass of a triangular plate with uniform density using calculus. The triangle has vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,2) and is bounded by the line \( y = 2x \). The plate's density is specified as 3 grams per square centimeter.

### Key Concepts:

- **Density**: Uniformly distributed mass over the area.
- **Moment**: Calculated by multiplying mass by its distance from an axis.
- **Center of Mass for a Strip**: Given by coordinates \( (x, x) \).

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Strip Consideration**:
   - A thin strip at position \( x \) has length \( 2x \) and width \( dx \).
   - Area of the strip: \( 2x \cdot dx \).
   - Mass of the strip: \( 6x \, dx \) (Density \(\times\) Area).

2. **Moments Calculation**:
   - Moment about x-axis: Integral of \( y \)-coordinate times differential mass (\( x \times 6x \, dx \)).
   - Moment about y-axis: Similar integral using \( x \)-coordinate.

3. **Integration**:
   - Integrate from 0 to 1 for both moments and total mass.
   - Moments yield a value of 2 each; total mass is 3.

4. **Center of Mass Coordinates**:
   - \( x\)-coordinate: \( \frac{2}{3} \) (Moment about y-axis divided by total mass).
   - \( y\)-coordinate: \( \frac{2}{3} \) (Moment about x-axis divided by total mass).

The center of mass is thus at \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \).

### Broader Context:

The text also discusses the application of calculus to find the center of mass for various geometric shapes. While linear shapes like triangles allow straightforward calculations, more complex shapes such as semicircles or parabolas require different calculus methods. It mentions "аша's rule," suggesting a specialized method applicable in this context, although specifics are not detailed. Overall, the text emphasizes how calculus adapts to different geometries when determining centers of mass.
