The text provides an overview of the Doppler effect, which describes how the frequency of waves changes due to relative motion between a source and an observer. The key point is that if there's movement between the two, the observed frequency will differ from the emitted frequency.

### Key Concepts:
- **Relative Motion:** Both the source and observer can move, affecting the wave frequency observed.
- **Frequency Equation:** 
  \[
  f_{\text{observer}} = f_{\text{source}} \times \frac{v \pm v_{\text{observer}}}{v \pm v_{\text{source}}}
  \]
  where \(f_{\text{observer}}\) is the observed frequency, \(f_{\text{source}}\) is the source frequency, \(v\) is the wave velocity, \(v_{\text{observer}}\) is the observer's velocity, and \(v_{\text{source}}\) is the source's velocity.

### Rules for Signs:
- **Observer Moving Towards Source:** Use a positive sign in both numerator and denominator. This results in an increased observed frequency (higher pitch).
- **Observer Moving Away from Source:** Use a negative sign in both numerator and denominator. This results in a decreased observed frequency (lower pitch).
- The same logic applies to the source's movement relative to the observer.

### Examples:
- If the source is stationary and the observer moves towards it, they experience "bunching up" of waves, leading to a higher frequency.
- Conversely, if moving away, the frequency decreases as the waves are spread out.

This equation is crucial for understanding how sound or wave frequencies change due to motion, which will be explored further in subsequent discussions.
