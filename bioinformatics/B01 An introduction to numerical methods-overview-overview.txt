The text explores the shift from analytical to numerical methods for solving differential equations. Analytical solutions require deriving exact formulas, which is often difficult and sometimes impossible. Instead, many differential equations are solved numerically by plotting points to approximate a solution graph.

The focus begins with initial value problems, where only one specific solution is needed based on given conditions. Numerical methods involve calculating x and y values to build an approximation of the solution curve rather than deriving exact equations.

An example provided is \(y = x^2\), used to demonstrate how derivatives can calculate slopes at any point, introducing tangent lines (instantaneous slope) and secant lines (average slope over a segment). This concept underpins Euler's method, developed by Leonhard Euler, which uses known slopes at specific points to approximate the solution curve. The method involves calculating new y-values from initial values and given slopes across small intervals (\(\Delta x\)).

The text highlights that reducing \(\Delta x\) improves approximation accuracy by adhering more closely to the curve. This approach is linked to calculus concepts like Riemann sums or integration, where smaller intervals yield better approximations of areas under curves. The author plans to explore this method further, including examining specific points such as "half points" for more effective regional exploration.
