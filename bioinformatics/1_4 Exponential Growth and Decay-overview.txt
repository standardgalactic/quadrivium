The text describes a process of solving a logistic growth model problem using given parameters. It starts with defining the maximum sustainable population (m) as 1000 and a growth rate (k) of 0.007, aiming to find an expression for the population at any time \( t \). The initial population is given as 350 when \( t = 0 \).

Using the logistic equation:

\[ y = \frac{m}{1 + ae^{-kmt}} \]

the text demonstrates how to substitute the known values (m, k) and solve for the unknown constant \( a \) using the initial condition. By setting \( y(0) = 350 \), it derives that \( a = \frac{35}{65} \).

The solution is then expressed as:

\[ y(t) = \frac{1000 \times \frac{35}{65}}{1 + \frac{35}{65}e^{-7t}} \]

The text also briefly transitions to discussing solving another type of problem involving a separable differential equation, illustrating the steps to separate variables and integrate both sides. It concludes by noting that exponentiating both sides can be part of finding a general solution for such equations.

The text provides a series of steps and solutions for solving differential equations, primarily focusing on separable first-order differential equations. Here’s a summary:

1. **First Problem:**
   - The equation involves exponentials and logarithms.
   - By using properties like \( e^{\ln(a)} = a \) and the addition rule for exponents, it's simplified to an expression involving constants.
   - After simplification, the solution is expressed in terms of powers of \( x \).

2. **Second Problem:**
   - In Leibniz notation, the differential equation is rewritten.
   - Multiplying both sides by appropriate factors and integrating leads to a solution involving \( y \) and \( x^3 \).
   - The final expression relates \( y \) to \( x^3 \), with integration constants.

3. **Third Problem:**
   - Another separable differential equation is solved using substitution.
   - Substituting \( u = 1 + x^3 \) simplifies the integral, resulting in a natural logarithm function of \( x \).
   - The solution involves taking square roots and includes an arbitrary constant.

4. **Longer Problem:**
   - This problem tests integration by parts rather than just separability.
   - The differential equation is separated into terms involving \( y \) and \( x \), each with exponential factors.
   - Integrating both sides results in a solution that requires the use of integration techniques like integration by parts.

Overall, these problems demonstrate solving differential equations using separation of variables, substitution, and integration techniques.

The text provides a step-by-step solution for solving integrals using integration by parts. It begins with the problem involving the product of two variables, \(y\) and \(e^{-y}\). The strategy is to apply the integration by parts formula:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

For the left-hand side, the author chooses \(u = y\) (thus \(du = 1 \cdot dy\)) and \(dv = e^{-y} \, dy\) (resulting in \(v = -e^{-y}\)). This results in:

\[
uv = -\frac{y}{e^y}
\]

and the integral becomes simpler:

\[
-\int e^{-y} \, dy = \frac{1}{e^y}
\]

Thus, combining these gives:

\[
-\frac{y}{e^y} + \frac{1}{e^y} + C_1
\]

For the right-hand side, a similar approach is used with \(u = 2x\) (thus \(du = 2 \cdot dx\)) and \(dv = e^{-x} \, dy\) (yielding \(v = -e^{-x}\)). This results in:

\[
uv = -\frac{2x}{e^x}
\]

and the integral simplifies to:

\[
-2 \int e^{-x} \, dx = \frac{-2}{e^x}
\]

Thus, combining these gives:

\[
-\frac{2x}{e^x} - \frac{2}{e^x} + C_2
\]

Equating both sides and simplifying by multiplying through by negative one to handle the multiple negatives, we get:

\[
\frac{y + 1}{e^y} = \frac{2x + 2}{e^x} + C
\]

This equation is not in explicit form for \(y\) as a function of \(x\), but it represents the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\).

The text discusses solving a separable first-order differential equation. The speaker explains how they manipulate an expression, aiming for simplification: achieving a common denominator and expressing the numerator in terms of \(2(x + 1) + c\), where \(c\) is a constant. This leads to various potential forms of the solution. Ultimately, this approach provides the general solution to the differential equation, emphasizing skill refinement in integration techniques, particularly integration by parts.

The text outlines a process for solving a population growth problem using a logistic equation. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Problem Setup**: 
   - We are given a maximum sustainable population (\(m\)) of 1000 and a growth rate (\(k\)) of 0.007.
   - The task is to find an expression for the population at any time \(t\) with an initial population (\(y_0\)) of 350.

2. **Logistic Equation**:
   - The logistic equation used is: 
     \[
     y = \frac{m \cdot e^{kmt}}{1 + a \cdot e^{kmt}}
     \]
   - Substitute \(m = 1000\) and \(km = 7\).

3. **Solving for Constant \(a\)**:
   - At \(t = 0\), the equation becomes: 
     \[
     350 = \frac{1000a}{1 + a}
     \]
   - Solving this gives \(a = \frac{35}{65}\).

4. **Final Expression**:
   - Substitute \(a\) back into the logistic equation to get:
     \[
     y = \frac{1000 \cdot \left(\frac{35}{65}\right) \cdot e^{7t}}{1 + \left(\frac{35}{65}\right) \cdot e^{7t}}
     \]

5. **Additional Problem**:
   - A separable differential equation is introduced: 
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = x^2 + 1
     \]
   - Solve by separating variables and integrating both sides.

6. **Integration**:
   - The integral of the right side results in:
     \[
     y = \ln|y| = \frac{x^3}{3} + x + c
     \]
   - Exponentiate to solve for \(y\).

The text emphasizes techniques like substitution, separation of variables, and integration by parts to solve these differential equations.

The text explains how to solve an integral involving the product of two variables, \( y \) and \( e^{-y} \), using integration by parts. The method involves choosing appropriate functions for \( u \) and \( v' \) to simplify the integral. Specifically:

1. **Left Hand Side:**
   - Set \( u = y \) and \( v' = e^{-y} \).
   - This gives \( u' = 1 \) and \( v = -e^{-y} \).
   - Applying integration by parts, the integral becomes:
     \[
     -\frac{y}{e^y} + \int \frac{1}{e^y} \, dy
     \]
   - Simplifying further results in:
     \[
     -\frac{y}{e^y} - \frac{1}{e^y} + C_1
     \]

2. **Right Hand Side:**
   - For the expression involving \( 2x \) and \( e^{-x} \), set \( u = 2x \) and \( v' = e^{-x} \).
   - This gives \( u' = 2 \) and \( v = -e^{-x} \).
   - Applying integration by parts, the integral becomes:
     \[
     -\frac{2x}{e^x} + \int \frac{2}{e^x} \, dx
     \]
   - Simplifying further results in:
     \[
     -\frac{2x}{e^x} - \frac{2}{e^x} + C_2
     \]

3. **Equating Both Sides:**
   - Set the simplified expressions equal to each other and solve for constants.
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     -\frac{y}{e^y} - \frac{1}{e^y} = -\frac{2x}{e^x} - \frac{2}{e^x} + C
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{y + 1}{e^y} = \frac{2x + 2}{e^x} + C
     \]

The solution is not explicit in terms of \( y \) because it cannot be isolated on one side.

The text is a discussion about simplifying an expression, possibly from solving a separable first-order differential equation. The speaker mentions having a common denominator and rewriting the numerator as \(2(x + 1) + c\), where \(c\) is some constant. They emphasize that there are various ways to express the solution, suggesting that this form is correct. Finally, they note that while solving the equation didn't heavily test differential equations knowledge, it did involve refining skills in integration by parts.
