The text describes a process of solving a logistic growth model problem using given parameters. It starts with defining the maximum sustainable population (m) as 1000 and a growth rate (k) of 0.007, aiming to find an expression for the population at any time \( t \). The initial population is given as 350 when \( t = 0 \).

Using the logistic equation:

\[ y = \frac{m}{1 + ae^{-kmt}} \]

the text demonstrates how to substitute the known values (m, k) and solve for the unknown constant \( a \) using the initial condition. By setting \( y(0) = 350 \), it derives that \( a = \frac{35}{65} \).

The solution is then expressed as:

\[ y(t) = \frac{1000 \times \frac{35}{65}}{1 + \frac{35}{65}e^{-7t}} \]

The text also briefly transitions to discussing solving another type of problem involving a separable differential equation, illustrating the steps to separate variables and integrate both sides. It concludes by noting that exponentiating both sides can be part of finding a general solution for such equations.

The text provides a series of steps and solutions for solving differential equations, primarily focusing on separable first-order differential equations. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **First Problem:**
   - The equation involves exponentials and logarithms.
   - By using properties like \( e^{\ln(a)} = a \) and the addition rule for exponents, it's simplified to an expression involving constants.
   - After simplification, the solution is expressed in terms of powers of \( x \).

2. **Second Problem:**
   - In Leibniz notation, the differential equation is rewritten.
   - Multiplying both sides by appropriate factors and integrating leads to a solution involving \( y \) and \( x^3 \).
   - The final expression relates \( y \) to \( x^3 \), with integration constants.

3. **Third Problem:**
   - Another separable differential equation is solved using substitution.
   - Substituting \( u = 1 + x^3 \) simplifies the integral, resulting in a natural logarithm function of \( x \).
   - The solution involves taking square roots and includes an arbitrary constant.

4. **Longer Problem:**
   - This problem tests integration by parts rather than just separability.
   - The differential equation is separated into terms involving \( y \) and \( x \), each with exponential factors.
   - Integrating both sides results in a solution that requires the use of integration techniques like integration by parts.

Overall, these problems demonstrate solving differential equations using separation of variables, substitution, and integration techniques.

The text provides a step-by-step solution for solving integrals using integration by parts. It begins with the problem involving the product of two variables, \(y\) and \(e^{-y}\). The strategy is to apply the integration by parts formula:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

For the left-hand side, the author chooses \(u = y\) (thus \(du = 1 \cdot dy\)) and \(dv = e^{-y} \, dy\) (resulting in \(v = -e^{-y}\)). This results in:

\[
uv = -\frac{y}{e^y}
\]

and the integral becomes simpler:

\[
-\int e^{-y} \, dy = \frac{1}{e^y}
\]

Thus, combining these gives:

\[
-\frac{y}{e^y} + \frac{1}{e^y} + C_1
\]

For the right-hand side, a similar approach is used with \(u = 2x\) (thus \(du = 2 \cdot dx\)) and \(dv = e^{-x} \, dy\) (yielding \(v = -e^{-x}\)). This results in:

\[
uv = -\frac{2x}{e^x}
\]

and the integral simplifies to:

\[
-2 \int e^{-x} \, dx = \frac{-2}{e^x}
\]

Thus, combining these gives:

\[
-\frac{2x}{e^x} - \frac{2}{e^x} + C_2
\]

Equating both sides and simplifying by multiplying through by negative one to handle the multiple negatives, we get:

\[
\frac{y + 1}{e^y} = \frac{2x + 2}{e^x} + C
\]

This equation is not in explicit form for \(y\) as a function of \(x\), but it represents the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\).

The text discusses solving a separable first-order differential equation. The speaker explains how they manipulate an expression, aiming for simplification: achieving a common denominator and expressing the numerator in terms of \(2(x + 1) + c\), where \(c\) is a constant. This leads to various potential forms of the solution. Ultimately, this approach provides the general solution to the differential equation, emphasizing skill refinement in integration techniques, particularly integration by parts.
