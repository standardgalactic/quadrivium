The text describes two types of digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras used for video recording. The first camera, on the left, features a smaller APS-C sensor and has an articulated viewing screen, which allows users to tilt it for easier self-recording. This makes it versatile for various shooting angles. On the right is a more advanced full-frame camera, specifically the Canon 5D Mark II, which offers greater depth of field coverage but lacks a hinge screen, making self-recording less convenient. Both cameras can use Canon EF lenses, enabling high-quality video capture and good image quality.
