The text explains how to solve a second-order linear differential equation with complex conjugate roots. The auxiliary equation given is \( m^2 + 4m + 7 = 0 \). Solving this using the quadratic formula yields:

\[ m = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 28}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{2}. \]

The square root of \(-12\) can be expressed as \(2\sqrt{3}i\), where \(i\) is the imaginary unit (\(i^2 = -1\)). Thus, the roots are:

\[ m_1 = -2 + \sqrt{3}i, \quad m_2 = -2 - \sqrt{3}i. \]

Here, \(\alpha = -2\) and \(\beta = \sqrt{3}\). Using these values in Euler's formula, the solution to the differential equation is expressed as:

\[ y(x) = e^{\alpha x}(c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x)). \]

Substituting \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), we get:

\[ y(x) = e^{-2x}(c_1 \cos(\sqrt{3}x) + c_2 \sin(\sqrt{3}x)). \] 

This form leverages the complex conjugate roots to express the solution in terms of real functions.

The text explains how to solve a quadratic equation with complex roots using Euler's formula and relates this to concepts in linear algebra. The auxiliary equation given is \( m^2 + 4m + 7 = 0 \). Solving it yields complex roots because the discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 28 = -12 \)) is negative.

The solutions for \( m \) are derived as:
\[ m_1 = -2 + i\sqrt{3} \]
\[ m_2 = -2 - i\sqrt{3} \]

Here, \(\alpha\) (the real part) is \(-2\) and \(\beta\) (the imaginary part without \(i\)) is \(\sqrt{3}\).

The general solution for the differential equation can be expressed using Euler's formula as:
\[ y = e^{\alpha x} (c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x)) \]

Substituting \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\):
\[ y = e^{-2x}(c_1 \cos(\sqrt{3}x) + c_2 \sin(\sqrt{3}x)) \]

This expression represents the solution to the differential equation with complex conjugate roots. The text emphasizes understanding this method within the context of a linear algebra lecture series, particularly focusing on using Euler's formula for handling complex numbers in solutions.
