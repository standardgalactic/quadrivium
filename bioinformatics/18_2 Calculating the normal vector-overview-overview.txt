The text outlines a technique to calculate a vector normal (perpendicular) to a surface defined by \( Z = G(X, Y) \) in 3D space. The process involves creating a function \( \text{G}(X, Y, Z) = Z - G(X, Y) \), where the contour at zero represents the original surface. This is conceptualized within four-dimensional space.

To find the normal vector, compute the gradient of this new function using the del operator (nabla). The resulting gradient vector is perpendicular to the surface at each point. To standardize this vector, it is normalized by dividing it by its magnitude, yielding a unit vector that consistently points away from the surface. This method efficiently determines normal vectors for any point on the given 3D surface.
