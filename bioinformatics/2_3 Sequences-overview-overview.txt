The text explores methods for analyzing sequences involving factorials to determine their convergence or divergence. It introduces an indirect approach where a convergent sequence must be both monotonic and bounded, without requiring the exact limit value \(L\).

1. **First Example - \(\frac{n!}{n^n}\):** The sequence is analyzed using the squeeze theorem, showing it converges to 0. This conclusion arises from its bounded nature (never exceeding 1) and its monotonic decrease.

2. **Second Example - \(\frac{n}{n+1}\):** The text examines this increasing sequence by comparing consecutive terms, demonstrating that each term is greater than the previous one, confirming its increase.

3. **Third Sequence - \( \frac{n!}{e^n} \):** Analyzed for monotonicity, it shows the sequence is increasing as each term is larger than the previous one due to \(\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \frac{n+1}{e}\), which is greater than 1 for \( n \geq 2\).

4. **Expression \((n + 1)/e \times a^n\):** The text discusses its growth behavior, concluding that it diverges for \( n \geq 2\) as the expression increases without bound.

The overall discussion emphasizes identifying monotonic sequences and understanding their boundedness to determine convergence. The speaker plans to focus on bounding criteria in future analyses to further comprehend convergence properties.
