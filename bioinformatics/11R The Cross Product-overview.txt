The text discusses several concepts related to vectors in three-dimensional space:

1. **Scalar Triple Product and Volume**: The scalar triple product, denoted as \( \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) \), can also be found by taking the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix composed of the vectors' components. This gives the volume of a parallelepiped formed by three vectors in space.

2. **Condition for Coplanar Vectors**: If the scalar triple product (or the determinant) equals zero, it implies that the three vectors lie in the same plane, resulting in no volume (volume = 0).

3. **Coordinate System Independence of Cross Product**: The cross product is independent of the coordinate system used, meaning if two vectors are transformed into a different coordinate system but remain within the same space, their cross product remains unchanged. This property holds as long as both vectors are defined in the same coordinate system.

4. **Area of Parallelogram Using Cross Product**: To find the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors, one calculates the norm (magnitude) of their cross product. The text provides an example with specific vector components and demonstrates how to compute this using determinants.

5. **Example Calculations**:
   - For the first example, after computing the cross product and its norm, the area is found to be \( \sqrt{59} \).
   - In the second example, since one vector is a scalar multiple of another (implying they are collinear), the area of the parallelogram formed is zero.

Overall, these concepts illustrate how geometric properties like volume and area can be computed using algebraic methods involving vectors in three-dimensional space.

The text explains several concepts related to vector mathematics and geometry in three-dimensional space:

1. **Scalar Triple Product and Volume**: The scalar triple product, given by the formula \( \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) \), or equivalently the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix formed by vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\), represents the volume of a parallelepiped. If this scalar triple product equals zero, it indicates that the three vectors lie in the same plane, resulting in no volume (i.e., they are coplanar).

2. **Coordinate System Independence**: The cross product is coordinate system independent, meaning its value does not change when the coordinate system is rotated or shifted, as long as both vectors involved are within the same coordinate system. This property allows for consistent results of a cross product regardless of how vectors are positioned in space.

3. **Calculating Area Using Cross Product**: The area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors can be found by taking the norm (magnitude) of their cross product. An example is provided with calculations using determinants to find the components of the cross product, followed by computing its magnitude to determine the area.

4. **Special Case Example**: A second scenario demonstrates that if one vector is a scalar multiple of another (e.g., \(\mathbf{v} = 2\mathbf{u}\)), they lie on the same line, and thus the parallelogram formed by them has zero area.

These concepts emphasize the geometric interpretations and mathematical operations involving vectors in three-dimensional space.
