The text discusses several concepts related to vectors in three-dimensional space:

1. **Scalar Triple Product and Volume**: The scalar triple product, denoted as \( \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) \), can also be found by taking the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix composed of the vectors' components. This gives the volume of a parallelepiped formed by three vectors in space.

2. **Condition for Coplanar Vectors**: If the scalar triple product (or the determinant) equals zero, it implies that the three vectors lie in the same plane, resulting in no volume (volume = 0).

3. **Coordinate System Independence of Cross Product**: The cross product is independent of the coordinate system used, meaning if two vectors are transformed into a different coordinate system but remain within the same space, their cross product remains unchanged. This property holds as long as both vectors are defined in the same coordinate system.

4. **Area of Parallelogram Using Cross Product**: To find the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors, one calculates the norm (magnitude) of their cross product. The text provides an example with specific vector components and demonstrates how to compute this using determinants.

5. **Example Calculations**:
   - For the first example, after computing the cross product and its norm, the area is found to be \( \sqrt{59} \).
   - In the second example, since one vector is a scalar multiple of another (implying they are collinear), the area of the parallelogram formed is zero.

Overall, these concepts illustrate how geometric properties like volume and area can be computed using algebraic methods involving vectors in three-dimensional space.
