The text outlines the process for evaluating three distinct line integrals over a parametric curve defined by \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (2\cos(t), 2\sin(t), t)\) from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 2\pi\). 

1. **Objective**: Compute the line integral of different vector functions along this curve.

2. **Functions for Line Integrals**:
   - For \(f_1(x, y, z) = y\), the setup is \(\int_{0}^{2\pi} 2\sin(t)(-2\sin(t)) \, dt\).
   - For \(f_2(x, y, z) = x\), it becomes \(\int_{0}^{2\pi} 2\cos(t) \cdot 2\cos(t) \, dt\).
   - For \(f_3(x, y, z) = z\), the integral is \(\int_{0}^{2\pi} t \cdot 1 \, dt\).

3. **Derivatives**:
   - The derivatives are: \(x'(t) = -2\sin(t)\), \(y'(t) = 2\cos(t)\), and \(z'(t) = 1\).

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Integral 1 simplifies to \(-4\int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^2(t) \, dt\).
   - Integral 2 simplifies to \(4\int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^2(t) \, dt\).
   - Integral 3 evaluates as \(\frac{1}{2}[t^2]_{0}^{2\pi} = 2\pi^2\).

5. **Trigonometric Identities**: 
   - The identities \(\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) = 1\) and the half-angle formulas are used to simplify Integrals 1 and 2.

6. **Result**: After simplification, contributions from sine and cosine terms cancel out, yielding a final result of \(2\pi^2\) for all integrals combined. 

In conclusion, the evaluation of these line integrals results in a net value of \(2\pi^2\).
