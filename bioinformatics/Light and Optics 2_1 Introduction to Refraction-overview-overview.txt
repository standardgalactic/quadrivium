The text provides an overview of light refraction principles, focusing on how light speed changes across different materials and how this affects its behavior at interfaces between media. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Speed of Light**: In a vacuum, light travels at approximately 299,800 km/s (denoted as C). When moving through other mediums like water or air, it slows down due to absorption and re-emission by atoms.

2. **Index of Refraction**:
   - The absolute index is calculated as the ratio of C to the speed of light in a material.
   - The relative index compares two materials using their respective indices or light speeds.

3. **Snell's Law**: Describes the bending of light at an interface between two media with different refractive indices: \( N_I \sin(\theta_I) = N_T \sin(\theta_T) \). Light bends towards the normal when entering a denser medium (higher index) and away from it in a rarer medium.

4. **Refraction and Reflection**:
   - Refracted light bends differently depending on whether it enters a denser or rarer medium.
   - Some light is reflected, especially at critical angles where total internal reflection occurs if the initial medium has a higher refractive index (\( N_I > N_T \)).

5. **Critical Angle**: Defined as the angle at which the refracted ray travels along the boundary between two media (\(\theta_T = 90^\circ\)), possible only when \( N_I > N_T \).

6. **Reflection Angles**: Follow mirror-like behavior where incident and reflected angles are equal.

7. **Prism**: Demonstrates dispersion by bending different colors of light at various angles due to their distinct indices of refraction (e.g., blue more than red).

8. **Terminology**: 
   - "Incident" refers to the ray approaching an interface.
   - "Transmitted" describes the ray passing through and moving away from the interface.

Understanding these principles helps in analyzing light behavior across different media interfaces, including refraction, reflection, and dispersion phenomena.
