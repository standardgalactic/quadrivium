The text provides a solution to the differential equation \( e^y \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x \), given that \( x > \sqrt{3} \) and an initial condition \( y(2) = 0 \).

1. **Formulation**: The problem is recognized as a first-order differential equation where the function \( y(x) \) and its derivative are multiplied.

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - To eliminate the derivative, integrate both sides with respect to \( x \).
   - The left side becomes the indefinite integral of \( e^y \frac{dy}{dx} \), which simplifies to \( e^y \) after integration.
   - The right side integrates \( 2x \) to give \( x^2 + C_1 \).

3. **Simplification**:
   - Combine constants from both sides into a single constant, resulting in \( e^y = x^2 + C \).
   - Use the initial condition \( y(2) = 0 \) to find \( C \):
     \[
     e^0 = 4 + C \implies 1 = 4 + C \implies C = -3
     \]
   - Thus, the equation becomes \( e^y = x^2 - 3 \).

4. **Solving for \( y \)**:
   - Take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \ln(x^2 - 3)
     \]

5. **Verification**:
   - Differentiate \( y = \ln(x^2 - 3) \) using the chain rule:
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x^2 - 3} \cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 3}
     \]
   - Substitute back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     e^y \frac{dy}{dx} = (x^2 - 3) \cdot \frac{2x}{x^2 - 3} = 2x
     \]
   - This confirms that the solution \( y = \ln(x^2 - 3) \) is correct.
