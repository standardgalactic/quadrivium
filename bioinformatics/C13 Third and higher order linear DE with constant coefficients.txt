Okay, now we want to move up to orders higher than 2, and remember when you do, it's just y, y' and then all the way, so we put these in most textbooks, I think, don't do that, but if you look at normal calculus textbooks, remember if that was a 4 there, it would be y' and you don't put just a 4 there because then it might look like y to the power of 4.
So these brackets denote to what power derivative you're taking is.
So in any way, your auxiliary function is going to be in this format, you can pause and just look at that and realize that this is what it's going to be, and you have to get the roots of all of this, and one or two things are going to happen, or combination of, we're not going to look at the complex conjugate roots, we'll just look in this course at the real distinct roots and real equal roots.
If it's distinct, it's going to be this c sub 1, c sub 2, c sub 3, and e to the power together with that m sub 1x, m sub 2x, m sub 3x until the end, and if they are equal, remember, you're going to have in the first term just m sub 1, they're all going to be m sub 1 because m sub 1 is going to equal m sub 2, it's going to be equal to m sub 3, etc.
So those are always going to stay m sub 1, but in the first term where you have no x, in the second term you're going to have an x, then you're going to have x squared, x to the x cubed, x to the power of 4, x to the power of 5, until x to the power of k minus 1, and this k minus 1 comes from writing the auxiliary equation out differently.
It's just to show you that the first one is x to the power of 0, where c sub 1x to the power of 0, c sub 2x to the power of 1, and c sub 3x squared, that there's this disconnect between the numbers, you shouldn't see it like that anyway.
But there's definitely no x there or x sub x to the power of 0 there for real equal roots, in other words, m sub 1 equals m sub 2 equals m sub 3, etc.
So you might get a combination of these because you're not just going to get two roots, you're going to have more than two roots for a higher order polynomial like that.
So let's look at an example in the next video.
