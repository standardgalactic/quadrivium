To solve the problem about balancing gravitational force and radiation pressure on a reflective sail in space, we can derive an expression for the necessary surface area of the sail. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Key Concepts

1. **Gravitational Force (\( F_g \))**: The force exerted by gravity between two masses is given by:
   \[
   F_g = \frac{G \cdot m_{\text{sun}} \cdot m_{\text{ship}}}{r^2}
   \]
   where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_{\text{sun}} \) is the mass of the Sun, \( m_{\text{ship}} \) is the mass of the spaceship, and \( r \) is the distance from the center of the Sun to the spaceship.

2. **Radiation Pressure Force (\( F_r \))**: For a perfectly reflective sail, the force due to radiation pressure is:
   \[
   F_r = \frac{2 \cdot I \cdot A}{c}
   \]
   where \( I \) is the solar intensity at distance \( r \), \( A \) is the area of the sail, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

3. **Solar Intensity (\( I \))**: The intensity of sunlight at a distance \( r \) from the Sun is:
   \[
   I = \frac{P_{\text{sun}}}{4 \pi r^2}
   \]
   where \( P_{\text{sun}} \) is the power output of the Sun.

### Balancing Forces

To find the area \( A \) such that the radiation pressure balances the gravitational pull, set \( F_g = F_r \):

\[
\frac{G \cdot m_{\text{sun}} \cdot m_{\text{ship}}}{r^2} = \frac{2 \cdot I \cdot A}{c}
\]

Substitute \( I = \frac{P_{\text{sun}}}{4 \pi r^2} \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{G \cdot m_{\text{sun}} \cdot m_{\text{ship}}}{r^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_{\text{sun}}}{4 \pi r^2}\right) \cdot A}{c}
\]

Simplify and solve for \( A \):

\[
G \cdot m_{\text{sun}} \cdot m_{\text{ship}} = \frac{2 \cdot P_{\text{sun}} \cdot A}{4 \pi c}
\]

\[
A = \frac{4 \pi G \cdot m_{\text{sun}} \cdot m_{\text{ship}} \cdot c}{2 \cdot P_{\text{sun}}}
\]

\[
A = \frac{2 \pi G \cdot m_{\text{sun}} \cdot m_{\text{ship}} \cdot c}{P_{\text{sun}}}
\]

### Numerical Calculation

Given:
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg s}^2 \)
- \( m_{\text{sun}} = 1.99 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( m_{\text{ship}} = 1500 \, \text{kg} \)
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( P_{\text{sun}} = 3.9 \times 10^{26} \, \text{W} \)

Substitute these values into the equation for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{2 \pi (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) (1.99 \times 10^{30}) (1500) (3 \times 10^8)}{3.9 \times 10^{26}}
\]

Calculate:

\[
A \approx 9.65 \times 10^5 \, \text{m}^2
\]

This is approximately \( 965,000 \, \text{m}^2 \), which is just under a square kilometer (\(1 \, \text{km}^2 = 10^6 \, \text{m}^2\)).

### Conclusion

The sail needs to be nearly one square kilometer in area to balance the gravitational pull of the Sun with radiation pressure for a spaceship weighing 1500 kg. This highlights the challenge of using solar sails for propulsion, as such large areas are required for significant thrust.
