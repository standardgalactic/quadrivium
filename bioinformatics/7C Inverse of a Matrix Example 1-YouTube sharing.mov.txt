This is where we left off our introduction to the inverse of a matrix.
We have matrix A, which is a 2 by 2 matrix, and we have its inverse, also a 2 by 2 matrix.
And we want to see if we do multiply these out, do we get the identity matrix?
Are we indeed correct?
Let's go for A multiplied by its inverse.
It's a 2 by 2, and this is a 2 by 2 matrix, so our result matrix is also going to be 2 by 2.
First of all, we're going to take row 1 and column 1.
Let's go, so that would be, that is going to be for us a 3 and a 1, and a 1 and a negative 2.
Let's multiply these out.
3 times 1 is 1, 1 times negative 2 is negative 2, 3 minus 2 is 1.
So, let's, our first answer there is going to be a 1.
The first element of 1.
Good.
Now, let's go for the, still the first row, but now the second column.
So, let's go, that is still a 3 and a 1.
Let's put it there, a 3 and a 1, and now we're going to have negative 1 half and 3 over 2.
If we multiply that out, 3 times negative 1 half is negative 3 over 2.
1 times 3 over 2 is plus 3 over 2, and that is 0.
Now, we're going to go for row 2, let's put it here, that's a 4 and a 2.
Column 1, 1 and negative 2, that gives us a 4, that gives us a negative 4, 4 minus 4 is 0.
And lastly, we're going to go for the 4 and the 2, then this column, negative 1 half and 3 over 2.
Let's see, 4 times negative 1 half is negative 2.
3 times 2 is 6, divided by 2 is positive 3 there.
Negative 2 plus 3 is positive 1.
And there we have it.
There we have it.
Our identity matrix.
Now let's see if we take the inverse and multiply it by the original matrix.
Let's see what we get then.
Still a 2 by 2 matrix, but now we're going to start with 1 and negative 1 half.
In other words, what we did here, go in red, is take that first row and now we're going to take that column.
In other words, the 3 and the 4.
Let's multiply 1 times 3 is 3.
Negative 1 half times 4 is negative 2, so 3 minus 2 is 1.
And we can already see where this is heading.
We'll take 1 and negative 1 half and we're going to now multiply it by that row, which was a 1 and a 2.
Let's see, 1 times 1 is 1.
Negative 1 half times 2 is negative 1, so 1 minus 1 is 0.
Now let's go for the second row of the inverse matrix.
Negative 2 and 3 over 2.
And the first column of matrix A is 3 and a 4.
Let's multiply those out.
That's minus 6.
And 3 times 4 is 12.
Divided by 2 is positive 6.
Negative 6 plus 6 is 0.
We're going to go for negative 2 and 3 over 2.
And then the last column of matrix A is a 1 and a 2.
That will be negative 2.
And 3 times 2 is 6.
Divided by 2 is positive 3.
Negative 2 plus 3 is positive 1.
And there we can see again our identity matrix.
What we've shown here is that there is an inverse of a matrix.
And we used our formula to do that in the introduction.
And we just checked if we do multiply them out.
Whether it is in this order or in that order.
We are going to get an identity matrix.
