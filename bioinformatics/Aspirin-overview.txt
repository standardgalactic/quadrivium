This text discusses the impact of aspirin on surgical outcomes. Patients taking high doses of aspirin (over 100 mg per day) face increased risks of perioperative bleeding, transfusions, reoperations, and longer hospital stays. Low-dose aspirin users (under 100 mg per day) experience more blood loss during surgery but do not have heightened needs for transfusions, reoperations, or extended hospital stays. Preoperative bleeding time does not correlate with these outcomes.

For elective surgeries, it is recommended to discontinue aspirin 5 to 7 days prior if possible. Minor emergency procedures can be done without stopping aspirin intake. However, in major emergencies or surgeries where excessive bleeding could worsen outcomes—such as neurosurgery—platelets and desmopressin may be administered to mitigate risks.

The text discusses the implications of aspirin use for patients undergoing surgery. High-dose aspirin (over 100 mg per day) is associated with increased risks of perioperative bleeding, transfusions, reoperation, and longer hospital stays. In contrast, low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg per day) increases blood loss but does not significantly impact the need for transfusions, reoperations, or extend hospital stays.

Preoperative bleeding time tests do not reliably predict these outcomes. Therefore, it is generally recommended to discontinue high-dose aspirin 5 to 7 days before elective surgery when possible. For minor emergency procedures, stopping aspirin intake may not be necessary. However, for major emergencies or surgeries where excessive bleeding could be detrimental (e.g., neurosurgery), platelets and desmopressin can be administered as precautions.
