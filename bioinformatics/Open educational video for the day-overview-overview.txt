Despite this, they successfully produced an educational video on abstract algebra, specifically explaining the stabilizer within the orbit-stabilizer theorem and showing that it forms a subgroup. They plan to visit Table Mountain tomorrow due to a public holiday and intend to share their experience in a future recording.
