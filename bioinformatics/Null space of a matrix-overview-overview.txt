The text provides an explanation of how to find the null space of matrices using systems of linear equations with a zero right-hand side (\( Ax = 0 \)). It outlines the process through examples and generalizes to higher dimensions:

1. **2x2 Matrix Example**: 
   - The matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 6 \end{bmatrix} \) is not invertible since its rows are linearly dependent.
   - After row reduction, it simplifies to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), leading to the equation \( x_1 + 3x_2 = 0 \).
   - The null space is parameterized as \( x_1 = -3x_2 \) with \( x_2 \) being a free variable, and its basis vector is \( (-3, 1) \).

2. **Generalization to Higher Dimensions**:
   - A matrix \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) results in the equation \( x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0 \).
   - The null space is spanned by two vectors: \( s(-2, 1, 0) \) and \( t(-3, 0, 1) \), where \( s \) and \( t \) are parameters.

3. **Further Example with More Variables**:
   - For the matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), row reduction gives \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - The resulting equations are \( x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3 + 4x_4 = 0 \) and \( x_2 + 2x_4 = 0 \), which are parameterized by free variables \( x_3 \) and \( x_4 \).

The text concludes with specific solutions to the system:
- By setting \( x_3 = 1, x_4 = 0 \), one solution is \( (-2, 0, 1, 0) \).
- By setting \( x_3 = 0, x_4 = 1 \), another solution is \( (0, -2, 0, 1) \).

These solutions illustrate how the null space consists of all linear combinations of such vectors, representing the complete set of solutions to the homogeneous system.
