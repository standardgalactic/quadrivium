In this video we'll look at the translation of axes in the triple integral and that would be two cylindrical coordinates.
In the blue arrow we'll see a point marked in the x, y, z plane.
If we look at the x, z, x, y plane where z equals zero though we can see our point in this x, y plane with a radius r and then a description of the angle going from the positive x, x axis until our line segment r.
In other words x will be r cosine of theta and y can be expressed as r sine of theta going up back to our point z remains z.
As we said in the previous video we can now construct a vector t in r theta and z. In other words it'll be r cosine of theta, r sine of theta and z.
We are just translating using our translation equations in creating this new vector.
We'll get the Jacobian matrix of our vector t in r theta and z and you can see it written out there.
The r cosine of theta being partially derived as far as r theta and z is concerned.
The same for r sine of theta and lastly for z.
If we get the positive determinant of this matrix we will end up with just r.
Looking at our triple integral then of our function, remember first of all it was over a region, a type 1 region, dz, dy, dx.
That'll be over a new region of our function f in our vector t of r times dz, dr, d theta.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay, go.
What I'm going to talk about neid cost.
Go do po blowing your neid cost.
If you don't do this, I will be tiles by nothing on Netflix.
You can do it again.
I will work for you.
I don't want to talk aboutelas and I want to talk about that here.
I can last and don't do this when I chose this.
I'm gonna post the martinez for my plan of peace.
It's wonderful.
Then you reach me.
The contract here is my final Life.
Mr.
The year is a place we go.
Now the business would work for them.
I should cover up both these steps.
The first place here in the roof move from my paw to be discussed literally.
