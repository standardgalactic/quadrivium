Lastly, I just want to show you something else as well.
I can just plot certain points.
If I just put round brackets 0,0 and there we have the plot right there.
I can make new ones or I can just separate them by commas.
So I can say, let's have then 1,2.
So that'll plot it for me there, 2,7.
So it'll start plotting these for me.
And if I say edit there, what it can do is if I just do a table.
Well, I shouldn't do that.
Let's just stick with these, which have disappeared now.
Sorry about that.
So you can just you can just plot certain points, point 3,3 and there it goes.
So if you had a list of values from an experiment, you can plot them here.
We can also do that with this table.
So in the new line, let's add a table and X can just if you just keep on hitting enter 2,3
and then just keep on hitting enter, it'll automatically enter.
And let's have
let's have over here
Y equals
Oh, let's not do that.
Let's just add some points.
Let's add one, two, three, four.
And you can see as I add them, they will start.
They will start forming or they they will all be added.
And if I click on this little graphic here, I can say connect them
and they will be connected with all the dots will be connected.
And of course, I can just give them
I can just give them
a different color here as well.
And we can insert to the right another column and we can do something else to that column.
And we might play around with that a bit later.
Or I encourage you to do certain certain things
as far as that other column is concerned.
But in essence, this is what we're going to do.
We're going to have
we're going to do an experiment and we're going to have
we're going to plot two different values to each other.
And that will form some form of graph here.
We can see it's a straight line.
So immediately we know it's got to be Y equals MX plus C.
And we just have to work out what MX plus C is going to be.
And certainly that is the beauty of playing around with a program like this.
