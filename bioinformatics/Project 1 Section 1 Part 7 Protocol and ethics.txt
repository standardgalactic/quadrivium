So, writing a protocol on ethics. Now, depending on where you work in the world, every country,
every region has rules and regulations as far as medical research is concerned. You have got
to be absolutely aware of what the situation is wherever you conduct your research. Find out as
much as you can. Never ever put the patients at risk. That is rule number one, and that is what
protocols and ethics are all about. And it really is different in different regions. If I were to do
a retrospective case control series as this year locally, I would really have to get ethics approval.
Even if my data is going to come from a patient file, the patient's already been managed,
patients will never be identified, it's not going to change any kind of management for those patients
because they've already been managed, there's really no danger to them in this situation,
I still have to get ethics approval for that. In other countries, ethics approval for a
retrospective folder review case control series such as this will not require ethics approval.
But it really, really depends where you are. Please be very careful, read up, find out,
talk to people about gathering data on human beings for clinical or medical research.
Locally in South Africa, we would first have to take a protocol which will involve writing down
all the steps that I've mentioned up till now. From the research question to the literature review,
everything has to be noted down in a protocol which then also states clearly how you're going to go
about it from this step. It goes through a departmental research committee and if that is
approved then only does it go to an ethics committee and if only after approval of that can you start
designing anything, can you go ahead from this step. So please find out what the situation is
where you are going to gather data from patients.
