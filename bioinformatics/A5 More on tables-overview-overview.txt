The text outlines a method for using a function in software to model and refine predictions from experimental data. It starts with setting up a linear function \( f(x) = mx + c \), initially with \( m = 1 \) and \( c = 0 \). Users input experimental \( x \)-values and corresponding results, which are plotted on a graph.

The software fits these points using the function by adjusting parameters \( m \) (slope) and \( c \) (intercept) to minimize the difference between observed data and the line defined by the function. This involves plotting residuals—differences between observed values and model predictions—on another graph, aiming to align them with zero on the y-axis.

The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes these differences, allowing for accurate predictions of future outcomes based on the model. The text also suggests more advanced techniques like least squares fitting will later be used to optimize accuracy by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
