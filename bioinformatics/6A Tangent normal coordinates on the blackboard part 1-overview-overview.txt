The text explains the tangent-normal-binormal (TNB) coordinate system used in differential geometry to describe motion along a curve. It begins with circular motion as an example, where the position vector's magnitude stays constant and the velocity vector is perpendicular to it. The concept of a body coordinate system is introduced, similar to helmet-mounted action cameras that show a perspective where the observer is stationary.

The TNB frame consists of three vectors relative to a moving particle along its path:

1. **Tangent Vector (t)**: A unit vector tangent to the curve at any point, obtained by differentiating the position vector with respect to time.
2. **Normal Vector (n)**: Perpendicular to the tangent vector and indicating curvature direction, derived by differentiating and normalizing the tangent vector.
3. **Binormal Vector (b)**: Orthogonal to both the tangent and normal vectors, found using their cross product.

This frame helps describe three-dimensional motion locally at any curve point, with each vector providing insights into the curve's geometry: travel direction, curvature direction, and spatial orientation. The text also hints at an upcoming exploration of another method for determining curvature using this system.
