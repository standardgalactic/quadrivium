The text describes the process of solving an indefinite integral using trigonometric integration techniques. It begins with the integral \(\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 4x}} \, dx\) and demonstrates how to simplify it by completing the square for the expression inside the square root. This transforms the original integrand into a form that resembles \(\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}\), which is suitable for trigonometric substitution.

To proceed, the text suggests substituting \(u = x + 2\), simplifying \(du\) to equal \(dx\). The integral now becomes \(\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u^2 - 4}} \, du\).

The method of trigonometric substitution is applied with \(u = 2\sec(\theta)\), leading to \(du = 2\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta) d\theta\). This substitution simplifies the integral further:

\[
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\sec^2(\theta) - 4}} \cdot 2\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta) \, d\theta
\]

This expression reduces to:

\[
\int \frac{2\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta)}{\sqrt{4\tan^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta = \int \sec(\theta) \, d\theta
\]

The integral of \(\sec(\theta)\) is known and given by:

\[
\ln |\sec(\theta) + \tan(\theta)| + C
\]

Finally, the text emphasizes that since \(u = 2\sec(\theta)\), and substituting back to express in terms of \(x\), one does not need to draw additional triangles for further substitution. The result is expressed using the known values of \(\sec(\theta)\) and \(\tan(\theta)\) from the earlier substitutions, leading to a final answer involving these trigonometric functions in terms of \(x\).

The text describes solving an integral using trigonometric substitution. Initially, it establishes that \( u = 2 \sec(\theta) \), leading to \( \sec(\theta) = \frac{u}{2} \). The expression \( u^2 - 4 \) under a square root simplifies to \( 2 \tan(\theta) \), resulting in \( \sqrt{u^2 - 4} = 2 \tan(\theta) \). Consequently, \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{u^2 - 4}}{2} \).

The text then substitutes these back into an expression involving the natural logarithm: 

\[
\ln(\sec(\theta)) + \tan(\theta) + c
\]

Substituting the expressions for secant and tangent, it becomes:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{u}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{u^2 - 4}}{2} + c
\]

Using \( u = x + 2 \), the expression transforms to:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{x+2}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{(x+2)^2 - 4}}{2} + c
\]

Simplifying further, it becomes:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{x+2}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 4x}}{2} + c
\]

The process involved completing the square and reversing the trigonometric substitution to express the solution in terms of \( x \).

The text appears fragmented and somewhat abstract, but it seems to revolve around themes of distance (one hundred miles), the process or effort involved in returning something, possibly after a significant event or journey, which might be described as a "nightmare." The repetition of phrases like "to return" suggests an ongoing struggle or mission. There is also mention of "Theidores," which could refer to a place or concept central to this narrative. The text implies anticipation and preparation ("Once a clue is ready...") before something can be returned to its origin, indicating a cyclical process. Overall, it seems to capture the tension and effort involved in returning something significant after an arduous experience.
