The text describes the process of solving an indefinite integral using trigonometric integration techniques. It begins with the integral \(\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 4x}} \, dx\) and demonstrates how to simplify it by completing the square for the expression inside the square root. This transforms the original integrand into a form that resembles \(\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}\), which is suitable for trigonometric substitution.

To proceed, the text suggests substituting \(u = x + 2\), simplifying \(du\) to equal \(dx\). The integral now becomes \(\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u^2 - 4}} \, du\).

The method of trigonometric substitution is applied with \(u = 2\sec(\theta)\), leading to \(du = 2\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta) d\theta\). This substitution simplifies the integral further:

\[
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\sec^2(\theta) - 4}} \cdot 2\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta) \, d\theta
\]

This expression reduces to:

\[
\int \frac{2\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta)}{\sqrt{4\tan^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta = \int \sec(\theta) \, d\theta
\]

The integral of \(\sec(\theta)\) is known and given by:

\[
\ln |\sec(\theta) + \tan(\theta)| + C
\]

Finally, the text emphasizes that since \(u = 2\sec(\theta)\), and substituting back to express in terms of \(x\), one does not need to draw additional triangles for further substitution. The result is expressed using the known values of \(\sec(\theta)\) and \(\tan(\theta)\) from the earlier substitutions, leading to a final answer involving these trigonometric functions in terms of \(x\).

The text describes solving an integral using trigonometric substitution. Initially, it establishes that \( u = 2 \sec(\theta) \), leading to \( \sec(\theta) = \frac{u}{2} \). The expression \( u^2 - 4 \) under a square root simplifies to \( 2 \tan(\theta) \), resulting in \( \sqrt{u^2 - 4} = 2 \tan(\theta) \). Consequently, \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{u^2 - 4}}{2} \).

The text then substitutes these back into an expression involving the natural logarithm: 

\[
\ln(\sec(\theta)) + \tan(\theta) + c
\]

Substituting the expressions for secant and tangent, it becomes:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{u}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{u^2 - 4}}{2} + c
\]

Using \( u = x + 2 \), the expression transforms to:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{x+2}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{(x+2)^2 - 4}}{2} + c
\]

Simplifying further, it becomes:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{x+2}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 4x}}{2} + c
\]

The process involved completing the square and reversing the trigonometric substitution to express the solution in terms of \( x \).

The text appears fragmented and somewhat abstract, but it seems to revolve around themes of distance (one hundred miles), the process or effort involved in returning something, possibly after a significant event or journey, which might be described as a "nightmare." The repetition of phrases like "to return" suggests an ongoing struggle or mission. There is also mention of "Theidores," which could refer to a place or concept central to this narrative. The text implies anticipation and preparation ("Once a clue is ready...") before something can be returned to its origin, indicating a cyclical process. Overall, it seems to capture the tension and effort involved in returning something significant after an arduous experience.

The text outlines steps for evaluating a trigonometric integral using techniques from calculus. The goal is to find the indefinite integral of \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 4x}} \, dx \).

Hereâ€™s a summary of the process:

1. **Complete the Square**: Convert \( x^2 + 4x \) into a perfect square form by completing the square:
   - Rewrite as \( (x+2)^2 - 4 \).

2. **Substitution**: Use substitution to simplify the integral:
   - Let \( u = x + 2 \), then \( du = dx \).
   - The integral becomes \( \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u^2 - 4}} \, du \).

3. **Trigonometric Substitution**: Apply trigonometric substitution to solve the integral:
   - Let \( u = 2 \sec(\theta) \), so \( du = 2 \sec(\theta) \tan(\theta) \, d\theta \).
   - Substitute into the integral: 
     \[
     \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2 \sec(\theta))^2 - 4}} \cdot 2 \sec(\theta) \tan(\theta) \, d\theta
     \]
   - Simplify using trigonometric identities:
     - \( (2 \sec(\theta))^2 - 4 = 4 (\sec^2(\theta) - 1) = 4 \tan^2(\theta) \).
     - The integral becomes \( \int \frac{2 \sec(\theta) \tan(\theta)}{2 \tan(\theta)} \, d\theta = \int \sec(\theta) \, d\theta \).

4. **Evaluate the Integral**: 
   - The integral of \( \sec(\theta) \) is \( \ln |\sec(\theta) + \tan(\theta)| + C \).

5. **Back-Substitution**:
   - Since \( u = 2 \sec(\theta) \), solve for \( \sec(\theta) \) and \( \tan(\theta) \) in terms of \( x \):
     - \( \sec(\theta) = \frac{u}{2} = \frac{x+2}{2} \).
     - Use the identity \( \tan^2(\theta) = \sec^2(\theta) - 1 \) to find \( \tan(\theta) \).

The final result is expressed in terms of \( x \), using the back-substitution results. The integral evaluates to:
\[ 
\ln \left| \frac{x+2}{2} + \sqrt{\left(\frac{x+2}{2}\right)^2 - 1} \right| + C
\]

The text provides an explanation of solving a trigonometric substitution problem. Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Equations:**
   - The equation starts with \( u^2 - 4 \).
   - It establishes that the secant of theta (\(\sec \theta\)) is equal to \( \frac{u}{2} \).

2. **Tangent Relationship:**
   - The square root of \( u^2 - 4 \) leads to an expression involving \( 2 \times \tan \theta \).
   - Simplifying gives \( \tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{u^2 - 4}}{2} \).

3. **Substitutions:**
   - Both secant and tangent values are substituted back into the original problem.
   - The substitution involves a trigonometric identity where \( u = x + 2 \).

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The natural logarithm expression is derived as:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{x+2}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 4x}}{2} + c
     \]
   - This results from completing the square and reversing the trigonometric substitution.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The process required some algebraic manipulation, including completing the square and using known values of secant and tangent to simplify back to the original variable \( x \).

The text appears fragmented and abstract, but it seems to revolve around themes of distance, repetition, and perhaps the difficulty or impossibility of returning somewhere named "Theidores." It suggests an ongoing struggle or a recurring attempt ("to return"), possibly hinting at something elusive or unattainable. The mention of a clue indicates that understanding or resolving this situation might require gathering more information or insight. Overall, it conveys a sense of unresolved tension and longing associated with the concept of returning.
