The text describes how to approximate the length of a curve defined by parametric equations \( x = f(t) \) and \( y = g(t) \). Both functions \( f \) and \( g \) are continuously differentiable, with derivatives that are not simultaneously zero. To find the length of the curve over an interval, you divide it into small segments between points on the curve.

For each segment, the distance between two consecutive points is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:

\[ l_k = \sqrt{(\Delta x_k)^2 + (\Delta y_k)^2} \]

where \( \Delta x_k = f(t_k) - f(t_{k-1}) \) and \( \Delta y_k = g(t_k) - g(t_{k-1}) \). By applying the mean value theorem, these differences can be expressed in terms of derivatives:

\[ \Delta x_k = f'(t_k) \cdot \Delta t_k \]
\[ \Delta y_k = g'(t_k) \cdot \Delta t_k \]

As \( \Delta t \) becomes smaller, \( l_k \) approximates the arc length between the points. The total length of the curve from point \( a \) to point \( b \) is then the sum of all these small segment lengths:

\[ L = \int_a^b \sqrt{(f'(t))^2 + (g'(t))^2} \, dt \]

This formula assumes that the path is traversed only once as \( t \) increases, with no retracing or doubling back.

The text explains how to approximate the length of a curve defined parametrically. For functions \( x = f(t) \) and \( y = g(t) \), where both are continuously differentiable with non-zero simultaneous derivatives, we can divide the interval into small segments. The length between consecutive points on these segments is approximated using the Pythagorean theorem: 

\[ l_k = \sqrt{(\Delta x_k)^2 + (\Delta y_k)^2} \]

Using the mean value theorem, \( \Delta x_k \) and \( \Delta y_k \) can be expressed in terms of derivatives as:

\[ \Delta x_k = f'(t_k) \cdot \Delta t_k \]
\[ \Delta y_k = g'(t_k) \cdot \Delta t_k \]

As \( \Delta t \) becomes smaller, these segments better approximate the arc length between points. The total curve length from \( a \) to \( b \) is then the sum of all such segment lengths:

\[ L = \int_a^b \sqrt{(f'(t))^2 + (g'(t))^2} \, dt \]

This formula assumes no retracing or doubling back of the path.
