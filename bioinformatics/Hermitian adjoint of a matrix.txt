In this video I want to introduce the hermitian adjoint of a complex matrix.
Then we're going to do complex matrix complex vector multiplication
and take the emission adjoint of that and see that that's going to be exactly the same
as doing the multiplication by first taking the emission adjoint of the vector
and then multiplying by the emission adjoint of the matrix.
Now we've looked at matrix vector multiplication.
What we now want to look at is, first of all, the hermitian adjoint.
So hermitian adjoint.
The emission adjoint of a matrix and then what happens when we multiply a matrix by a vector
and take the emission adjoint of that multiplication.
Now we've seen the emission adjoint of a vector and nothing other happens.
This is the complex transpose.
So let's write complex transpose.
That's what we're doing.
We're taking any matrix A and let's say that matrix A consists of all these elements.
Lowercase i subscript ij.
And then we have that 1 is less than or equal to i is less than or equal to m, the number of rows.
And 1 is less than or equal to j is less than or equal to n, the number of columns.
And when we take that transpose, so we're going to say we take the hermitian adjoint
because we have that any of these little elements are elements of the set of complex numbers.
And that gives us a complex matrix.
And we want to take the hermitian adjoint of that or the complex transpose of that.
Well, all we're going to do is, the same as with a normal transpose,
if I can use the word normal transpose,
we're going to have that any element in row i column j is going to end up in row j column i of this transpose.
But we do take the complex conjugate of each of those values.
Now, to make those things clear, let's just have, for instance, let's do this.
Let's do 1, 3 minus i, minus i, i, 4, 2.
Let's just take this 2 by 3 complex valued matrix.
And we want to calculate the hermitian adjoint of that matrix.
Well, that row is going to become a column.
And we take the complex conjugate of each of these values.
So that's going to be 1.
The negative 3 i becomes, the 3 minus i becomes 3 plus i.
The negative i becomes a positive i.
And then the second row becomes the second column.
i becomes a negative i.
4 remains a 4.
2 remains a 2 because it's plus 0 i.
And so nothing is going to change for those real valued elements.
And that's the emission adjoint.
All we have to do now, or next at least, is consider
what would happen if I do a matrix vector multiplication
and then I take the hermitian adjoint of that.
And we can show that that is going to be the exact same thing
as taking this hermitian adjoint of the vector
and multiplying that now by this hermitian adjoint of our matrix.
And those two things are exactly the same.
Can we prove that that is so?
So, yes, you can.
And let's just think through the steps that we might require for showing this.
So what I want to do is just first to look at a times u
and then take the emission adjoint.
So if I multiply a by u,
what I'm going to do is just select any arbitrary.
Let's take row i of a.
And so row i of a is going to be, it's going to be all these elements.
It's going to be a, it's in row i, column 1.
a row i, column 2.
And then a, it's still in row i, 3, all the way down to,
still in row i, but now in column n.
If you think about it, that is going to be this ith row.
u, and I'm going to do that multiplied by this vector u.
And let's make the vector u, u1, u2, all the way down to un,
such that I can do this multiplication.
And now we're just talking about the dot product
because it's going to be multiplying this element with that element
plus this element with that element
all the way down to this element times that element.
And I'm just summing over all those products.
And if I do that, and then I will end up with something like this.
Let's look at that.
It'll be a, it'll be a, and then it's going to be i1, u1.
And remember, these are both complex numbers
plus ai2, u2, plus all the way down to ain plus un.
And that's going to give me, it's this dot product,
and I take row i, and I'm multiplying that by u.
So it just denotes any one of these, any one of these rows.
And that's going to be, as far as this new vector
that comes out of this multiplication, a u,
is this going to be, you know, the ith element
in that brand new vector.
And now what I want to do is,
I want to take the emission adjoint of that.
So if I just take the emission adjoint of this,
okay, it just means that, you know, for that element,
we'll have to take the complex conjugate
of all of these values.
So i1, u1, plus i2, u2,
plus all the way down to i n, u n.
And I'm just taking the complex conjugate
of all those products.
And that's going to give me the new element.
And the only difference is that
it's now going to be a row vector.
But it's still going to be the ith element
in that row vector.
And let's do it the other way around, though.
Let's talk about what would happen
if I take the emission adjoint of u first.
Now it means I'm going to have,
I'm going to have u1, it's complex conjugate,
u2, it's complex conjugate,
all the way down to u n,
and it's complex conjugate.
Now if I think about row i,
these two row i in A,
now that's going to turn into column j
of the emission adjoint of A,
nothing other than what would happen
if you just take the transpose.
And so what's going to happen there,
I'm taking row i that we had before,
and it becomes column j,
and now it's just going to be the following.
The actual values,
now referring to the original matrix,
it's still going to be these values,
and it's still going to be that value,
all the way down to that value,
and I'm just going to take
the complex conjugate of each of these.
And now it's the same thing,
I'm taking this dot product
of that row vector,
and this column vector,
so it's just going to be one by one element,
product of that,
adding all of that,
and you'll see it lands up exactly there.
And we've shown,
or that is at least the mechanics of showing,
that these two things are equivalent.
So what I would like to do is,
let's take this matrix,
we're going to take this matrix A,
let's make it 2 plus i,
let's make it 3,
let's make it 2 plus i,
let's make it negative i,
and let's make it 7,
and let's have our vector,
let's make our vector u,
here's our vector u,
let's make it 1 plus 2i,
let's make it 3,
and let's make it 4 minus i,
and I'm still going for these round brackets.
And we want to know,
if we take a times u,
and then the mission adjoint,
is that at least 4?
We have here going to equal,
the product of u transpose,
or complex transpose times a,
let's have a look at this.
Let's do a times u,
let's do that first,
I'm going to write it down here,
I'm going to write a down here,
1, 2 plus i,
and 3,
we're going to have 2 plus i,
we'll have negative i,
and we'll have 7,
and we're going to multiply that by,
1 plus 2i,
3,
and 4 minus i,
let's have that.
So it's the dot product,
this first row,
and that column,
so 1,
1 times 1 plus 2i,
that's 1 plus 2i,
plus,
we're summing over all these products,
3 times 2 plus i,
that gives me,
6 plus 3i,
and then 4 minus i times 3,
well that gives me,
plus 12 minus 3i.
Now,
this row and that column,
so I've got 2i,
plus,
2 plus i,
multiplied by 1 plus 2i,
so 2 times 1 is 2,
plus 4i,
plus i,
and then i times i is negative 1,
so that makes that a negative 2,
then,
negative i times 3,
well that's negative 3i,
and then 7 times 4 minus i,
that is,
that is just going to be,
28 minus 7i,
and so let's have a look at that,
so I've got 1,
plus 6 is 7,
plus 12 is 19,
and I've got 2i,
plus 3i is 5i,
5i minus 3i is plus 2i,
and then 2 minus 2 is 0,
plus 28 is 28,
and I have 4i,
plus 1i is 5i,
minus 3i is 2i,
minus 7i is minus 5i,
and I do remember,
this is just equal to a times u,
now let's look at what happens,
if I take a times u,
take the emission adjoint of that,
well that is going to be,
19 minus 2i,
and 28 minus,
becomes a plus,
5i,
so 19,
multiply this by negative 1,
multiply this by negative 1,
and we're taking the transpose,
so we end up there,
so let's consider the following,
let's take the emission adjoint of u,
now that's going to be,
1 minus 2i,
3 and 4 plus i,
and if I take the emission adjoint,
of course of a,
that's going to leave me with,
1,
2 minus i,
and a 3,
and then that row becomes,
the second column,
2 minus i,
positive i,
and 7,
and so let's multiply these,
with each other,
I want to take the emission adjoint,
of u,
and multiply that,
by the emission adjoint,
of a,
I'm going to write this one down here,
1 minus 2i,
I've got a 3,
and I've got a 4 plus i,
and I'm multiplying it,
by the emission adjoint,
of a,
and so that,
I'm going to write that up here,
1,
2 minus i,
and 3,
leave myself some space,
2 minus i,
i,
and 7,
and so we're going to have,
1,
2 elements,
which is exactly what we want,
and it's the dot product of this row,
and this column,
so 1 times 1 minus i,
that's 1 minus 2i,
that's 1 minus 2i,
3 times 2 minus i,
that is plus 6 minus 3i,
and 3 times 4 plus i,
so that's going to be positive 12 plus 12 plus 3i,
now,
I didn't leave myself enough space,
so I'll just do it down here,
but it's the dot product of this row,
and that column,
again,
1 minus 2i times 2 minus i,
1 times 2 is 2,
1 times negative i is negative i,
negative 2i times 2,
that's negative 4i,
and then negative times a negative is positive 2,
but i,
that leaves me with a negative 2,
and then 3 times i is plus 3i,
and then plus 28 plus 7i,
oh,
I'm really out of space there,
so eventually,
I've got you,
emission adjoint,
emission adjoint of a,
I've just got to simplify these two,
so 1 plus 6 is 7,
plus 12,
that leaves me with the 19 that I required,
negative 2i,
negative 3i is negative 5i,
plus another 3i,
that's negative 2i,
minus 2i,
so that's cool,
and 2 minus 2 is 0,
plus 28 is 28,
negative i,
negative 4i,
that's negative 5i,
plus 3i is negative 2i,
plus 7 is positive 5i,
positive 5i,
and there we go,
we see exactly the same result there,
as we do there.
