Before we go on onto one more property of logarithms,
let us have a look at a slightly more complex example. We are asked to solve
for t. And our equation would be something like, let's say 16e to the power 0.05t
equals 32. Now our unknown is in the exponent and we know to solve for these we can use logarithms.
But because we are dealing with Euler's number, let us use the natural log. Let's write,
we can simplify this equation though, we can divide both sides by 16 first of all. So we'll have
E to the power 0.05t equals 32 over 16. So I've just taken 16 to the other side and that equals 2.
Now I can take the natural log of, log of, of both sides. So the natural log of E to the power 0.05t
equals the natural log of 2. I can use my exponent or my power property and bring that
exponent forward 0.05t natural log of E equals the natural log of 2. Now what is the natural log of E?
Well remember that's the same as writing the log base E of E and that equals just 1.
So what do we have here? We have 0.05t times 1. Natural log of E is just 1 equals natural log of 2.
And if I multiply both sides by 20 I get t equals 20 times the natural log of 2.
