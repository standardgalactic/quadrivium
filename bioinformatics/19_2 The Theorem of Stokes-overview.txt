The video discusses Stokes' Theorem, a fundamental result in vector calculus. Interestingly, it was Lord Kelvin (referred to as "Lord Calvin" due to an error) who initially stated the theorem, which he then posed as a question for students at Cambridge. The theorem is also known as Green's Theorem in three-dimensional space.

Stokes' Theorem relates a closed line integral around a curve to a surface integral over a surface bounded by that curve. Specifically, it states that the line integral of a vector field \(\mathbf{f}\) dotted with \(d\mathbf{r}\) around a closed curve is equal to the double surface integral of the curl of \(\mathbf{f}\) dotted with the normal vector over the surface.

The theorem connects concepts from Green's Theorem (in two dimensions) and generalizes them into three-dimensional space. It involves calculating the curl of a vector field \(\mathbf{f} = (m, n, p)\), using a determinant formula involving the unit vectors \(i\), \(j\), \(k\) and partial derivatives.

The theorem applies to a surface \(S\) intersected by a plane curve, where their intersection forms a closed loop. A normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) is used in calculations, oriented according to the right-hand rule: curling fingers along the curve's path directs the thumb (normal vector) upwards.

When dealing with a specific surface described as \(z = G(x, y)\), one can construct an auxiliary function \(G(X, Y, Z) = Z - G(X, Y)\). The gradient of this function helps in computing the necessary dot product for the theorem's application. Stokes' Theorem is celebrated for its ability to unify concepts from multivariable calculus.

The text discusses how to derive the unit normal vector for a surface defined by a function, and then applies this concept to evaluate surface integrals. Here's a summary:

1. **Unit Normal Vector**: To find the unit normal vector of a surface, you divide the gradient of the defining function by its norm. This yields a vector that is perpendicular (normal) to the surface with unit length.

2. **Surface Integrals in 3D**: When dealing with surfaces given by equations like \(Z = G(X, Y)\), the differential area element \(DS\) can be expressed as \(\sqrt{(\partial Z/\partial X)^2 + (\partial Z/\partial Y)^2 + 1} \, dA\). This transformation allows surface integrals to be converted into double integrals over a plane (XY plane in this case).

3. **Coordinate Transformations**: Depending on the form of the surface equation (e.g., \(Y = G(X, Z)\) or \(X = G(Y, Z)\)), different terms simplify (like \(\partial Y/\partial Y = 1\)), making it easier to compute integrals.

4. **Stokes' Theorem**: The text connects these concepts with Stokes' theorem, which is an extension of Green's theorem from two dimensions to three dimensions. This theorem relates a surface integral over a vector field to a line integral around the boundary of the surface in 3D space.

Overall, the text explains how to handle and compute surface integrals in three-dimensional space by transforming them into more manageable double integrals on a plane, using normal vectors derived from gradients.
