The text outlines the process of conducting three common parametric statistical tests using SPSS software: the independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, and simple linear regression. 

1. **Independent Samples T-Test**: This test compares the ages between two groups—patients with diabetes and those without—using a binary grouping variable (yes/no). The results are provided for scenarios assuming equal and unequal variances. In this case, there is no statistically significant difference in age based on diabetes status at an alpha level of 0.05.

2. **One-Way ANOVA**: This test compares the means of "age" across multiple groups categorized by "grade." The analysis yields a non-significant result (p-value = 0.736), indicating no significant difference in age among different grades at an alpha level of 0.05.

3. **Simple Linear Regression**: A scatter plot is used to examine the relationship between age and temperature, which does not reveal a clear correlation. The regression analysis shows a non-significant p-value (0.468), suggesting no significant linear relationship between heart rate and age.

The text emphasizes that it focuses on demonstrating how to perform these analyses in SPSS rather than testing the assumptions for parametric tests or validating their use over non-parametric alternatives.
