The text discusses various presentations of acute appendicitis and explains why symptoms can vary based on anatomy. It begins with classical symptoms: peri-umbilical discomfort that moves to the right iliac fossa, anorexia, nausea, constipation, and low-grade fever. In these cases, tenderness over McBurney's point typically leads to an immediate surgical intervention without extensive diagnostic work-up.

The anatomical basis for these symptoms is explained by the appendix’s position and innervation. The vermiform appendix is a true diverticulum of the colon with variable positioning, which affects symptom presentation. Inflammation initially causes visceral pain felt around the umbilicus due to midgut embryology. As inflammation spreads to parietal peritoneum, localized pain becomes apparent.

The appendix can vary in position (e.g., retrocecal, retrocolic), leading to different symptoms. For instance, if it extends into the pelvis, it may irritate the rectum and cause diarrhea, deviating from classical symptoms. Thus, appendicitis presentations depend on the anatomical location of the appendix and resulting local effects.

The text discusses how a surgeon might introduce a chapter on a diseased organ system by focusing on a patient with acute appendicitis. It emphasizes that while classical symptoms exist—such as peri-umbilical discomfort progressing to right iliac fossa pain, anorexia, nausea, constipation, and mild fever (up to 38.5°C)—many patients do not present these textbook signs.

The appendix's anatomical variability affects symptom presentation. It is a cylindrical structure at the cecum base with potential sizes ranging from 2 cm to over 20 cm. Its position can vary significantly, influencing clinical symptoms due to its innervation by visceral nerves and proximity to different abdominal structures.

Classically, pain starts near the umbilicus due to inflammation in the midgut region but localizes as it affects parietal peritoneum. However, if an appendix is located in the pelvis or other non-standard positions, symptoms like rectal irritation causing diarrhea may occur instead of typical signs. The variability in position and anatomy thus leads to diverse clinical presentations beyond the classical description.
