The text discusses various presentations of acute appendicitis and explains why symptoms can vary based on anatomy. It begins with classical symptoms: peri-umbilical discomfort that moves to the right iliac fossa, anorexia, nausea, constipation, and low-grade fever. In these cases, tenderness over McBurney's point typically leads to an immediate surgical intervention without extensive diagnostic work-up.

The anatomical basis for these symptoms is explained by the appendixâ€™s position and innervation. The vermiform appendix is a true diverticulum of the colon with variable positioning, which affects symptom presentation. Inflammation initially causes visceral pain felt around the umbilicus due to midgut embryology. As inflammation spreads to parietal peritoneum, localized pain becomes apparent.

The appendix can vary in position (e.g., retrocecal, retrocolic), leading to different symptoms. For instance, if it extends into the pelvis, it may irritate the rectum and cause diarrhea, deviating from classical symptoms. Thus, appendicitis presentations depend on the anatomical location of the appendix and resulting local effects.
