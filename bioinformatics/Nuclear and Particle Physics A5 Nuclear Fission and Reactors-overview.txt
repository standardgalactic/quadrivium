This text discusses calculating the mass of uranium-235 needed annually to operate a 300 MW power plant with 25% energy conversion efficiency, using nuclear fission. The power plant produces \(3.0 \times 10^9\) watts continuously. Here's a summary of the steps and concepts involved:

1. **Energy Production Calculation**:
   - Determine yearly energy output by multiplying the power (in joules per second) by the number of seconds in a year: 
     \[
     3.0 \times 10^9 \, \text{W} \times 31,536,000 \, \text{s/year} = 9.46 \times 10^{16} \, \text{joules/year}
     \]

2. **Energy per Fission Reaction**:
   - Each fission of uranium-235 releases 200 MeV, but only 25% is converted to electricity (50 MeV or \(8 \times 10^{-14}\) joules).

3. **Number of Reactions Needed**:
   - Calculate the number of fission reactions needed by dividing total energy required by the energy per reaction:
     \[
     \frac{9.46 \times 10^{16} \, \text{joules/year}}{8 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{joules/reaction}} = 1.18 \times 10^{30} \, \text{reactions/year}
     \]

4. **Mass of Uranium-235**:
   - Using Avogadro's number and the molar mass of uranium-235 (\(235 \, \text{g/mol}\)), convert reactions to moles, then grams:
     \[
     \frac{1.18 \times 10^{30} \, \text{reactions}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol}} = 1.96 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol}
     \]
   - Convert moles to grams:
     \[
     1.96 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol} \times 235 \, \text{g/mol} = 4.61 \times 10^8 \, \text{grams/year} = 461,000 \, \text{kg/year}
     \]

5. **Reactor Operations**:
   - Discusses the use of enriched uranium (about 3% U-235) in a reactor core.
   - Neutron moderation is necessary to sustain fission reactions, using water as a moderator.
   - Control rods made from materials like boron or cadmium regulate neutron absorption to maintain criticality and prevent supercritical conditions.

6. **Pressurized Water Reactor**:
   - Describes how heat generated by fission is used in pressurized water reactors to produce steam that drives turbines for electricity generation, maintaining control through rods to avoid meltdown scenarios.

This comprehensive explanation covers the theoretical aspects of nuclear power production and reactor management necessary for safe operation.

The text describes a problem involving a 5600 megawatt nuclear power plant that uses cooling water entering at 216°C and exiting at 275°C without forming steam due to pressurization. The specific heat capacity of water between these temperatures is approximately 4,420 joules per kilogram per Kelvin. To calculate the mass flow rate of water needed to cool the reactor core, we use the formula for heat energy transfer: \( Q = m \cdot C \cdot \Delta T \), where \( m \) is the mass of water, \( C \) is the specific heat capacity, and \( \Delta T \) is the temperature change (59°C or Kelvin).

Given that power equals energy per second (\( P = 5600 \times 10^6 \) watts), we set up the equation for power as:

\[ P = m \cdot C \cdot \Delta T \]

Solving for mass flow rate (\( m/t \)) gives:

\[ \frac{m}{t} = \frac{P}{C \cdot \Delta T} \]

Substituting in the known values:

\[ \frac{m}{t} = \frac{5600 \times 10^6}{4,420 \times 59} \approx 21,000 \text{ kg/s} \]

This means approximately 21 tons of water per second are required to cool a 5600 megawatt power plant. The text references the importance of this cooling process by mentioning incidents like those in Japan where disrupted water supply led to reactor core meltdowns under supercritical conditions.

This text discusses several aspects related to nuclear power production using Uranium-235 in a fission reactor. Here's a summary:

1. **Power Production Calculation:**
   - A power plant generates 3.0 × 10^9 watts (W) and operates at 25% efficiency, converting only part of the fission energy into usable electricity.
   - To find out how much Uranium-235 is used annually, it calculates total yearly energy output in joules: approximately 9.46 × 10^16 J per year.
   - Each fission reaction of Uranium-235 releases about 200 MeV (mega electron volts), but only 25% efficiency means 50 MeV is converted to useful energy, equivalent to 8.0 × 10^-12 joules per reaction.
   - The number of fissions needed annually is calculated by dividing total yearly energy by the energy per fission: about 1.18 × 10^28 reactions.
   - Using Avogadro’s number and molar mass considerations, it calculates that approximately 2 tonnes of Uranium-235 are required annually.

2. **Reactor Operation Principles:**
   - The enriched Uranium-235 (about 3%) is used in fuel rods within the reactor core.
   - Neutrons released during fission need to be slowed down by a moderator, typically water, to sustain further reactions.
   - Maintaining critical conditions ensures a steady chain reaction; subcritical leads to decay, while supercritical can cause runaway reactions.

3. **Control Mechanisms:**
   - Control rods made of materials like boron or cadmium absorb excess neutrons and regulate the reactor’s state between critical and supercritical conditions.
   - Adjustments are made using these control rods to prevent accidents such as meltdowns.

4. **Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR):**
   - Describes a PWR where heat from fission in water is transferred to another water loop that turns into steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.
   - The system includes safeguards like separate loops for radioactive and non-radioactive water and uses control rods to maintain criticality.

The text emphasizes safety measures, efficiency calculations, and operational principles necessary for managing a nuclear power plant.

The text discusses calculating the mass flow rate of cooling water required for a 5600 megawatt nuclear power plant. The water enters at 216°C and exits at 275°C without forming steam due to being pressurized. Using the specific heat capacity of water (4,420 J/kg·K) within this temperature range, the text calculates the mass of water needed per second.

The calculation is based on equating the power output (5600 MW or \(5.6 \times 10^9\) W) to the energy required to raise the temperature of the cooling water by 59°C (\(\Delta T\)). The formula used is:

\[ P = Cm\Delta T \]

Rearranging for mass flow rate (\(m/t\)) gives:

\[ m/t = \frac{P}{C\Delta T} \]

Substituting the values, we find that approximately 21,000 kg/s (or 21 tons/s) of water is needed to cool the reactor core. The text also references a real-world example where such cooling was disrupted in Japan, leading to a nuclear meltdown due to insufficient cooling.
