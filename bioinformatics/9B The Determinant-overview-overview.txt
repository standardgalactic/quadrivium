The lecture on linear algebra covers key concepts related to determinants and their applications in matrices:

1. **Importance of Determinant**: The determinant is essential for finding the inverse of a matrix \( A \) using the formula:
   \[
   A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \times \text{adj}(A)
   \]
   If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular and lacks an inverse.

2. **Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix**: The process involves simplifying calculations by choosing rows or columns with zeros for cofactor expansion. For instance:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   The determinant, calculated by expanding along the first column, is 6.

3. **Scalar Multiplication**: When a matrix \( A \) is multiplied by a scalar \( k \), the determinant changes as:
   \[
   \text{det}(kA) = k^n \times \text{det}(A)
   \]
   where \( n \) is the dimension of the square matrix. For example, multiplying a 3x3 matrix by 3 scales its determinant by \( 27 \).

4. **Matrix Addition**: There is no direct formula for finding the determinant of the sum of two matrices (\( A + B \)); it must be computed after performing the addition.

5. **Product of Matrices**: The determinant of a product of square matrices equals the product of their determinants:
   \[
   \text{det}(CD) = \text{det}(C) \times \text{det}(D)
   \]
   This property is demonstrated using 2x2 matrices.

The lecture also addresses finding the determinant of an inverse matrix. For an invertible matrix \( A \), the determinant of its inverse is:
\[
\frac{1}{\text{det}(A)}
\]
This requires that \( A \) be invertible (i.e., having a non-zero determinant), as division by zero is undefined.

Overall, these concepts emphasize the importance and various methods for calculating determinants in different matrix operations.
