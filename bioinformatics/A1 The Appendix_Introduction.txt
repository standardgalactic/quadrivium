My name is Jean Club and I'm a surgeon at the Acute Care Surgery Unit at Grutuskir Hospital
in Cape Town.
One of the most common diagnoses we have is that of acute appendicitis.
Unfortunately, these patients don't always present as you might expect from the textbook.
Let's have a look at what we'll discuss in this video series.
We'll look at the anatomy and physiology of the appendix.
Of course, the anatomy plays an integral role in how the patient presents to you.
We'll look at the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and how to manage these patients appropriately.
We'll also look at some special circumstances.
The elderly patient, the pregnant patient and perhaps the immunocompromised patient.
It's not only acute appendicitis that might bring the patient to hospital as far as the
appendix is concerned, there are also some other conditions that you must always keep
in mind.
Let's have a look.
