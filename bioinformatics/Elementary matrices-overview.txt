Certainly! Let's break down the process of solving a system of linear equations using elementary matrices, as described in your text. This method involves transforming the coefficient matrix into reduced row echelon form (RREF) by applying a series of elementary row operations.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Start with the System:**
   - Consider the system of equations:
     \[
     4x - 2y = 6
     \]
     \[
     y = 1
     \]

2. **Write in Matrix Form:**
   - The augmented matrix for this system is:
     \[
     A|b = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Elementary Matrices:**
   - Each elementary row operation corresponds to multiplying by an elementary matrix \( E_i \).

4. **Transformations:**

   - **Step 1:** Normalize the first row.
     - Multiply the first row by \( \frac{1}{4} \) (elementary matrix \( E_3 \)):
       \[
       E_3 = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{4} & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
       \]
     - Resulting matrix:
       \[
       \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{3}{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
       \]

   - **Step 2:** Eliminate the \( y \)-term in the first equation.
     - Add \( \frac{1}{2} \) times the second row to the first row (elementary matrix \( E_4 \)):
       \[
       E_4 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
       \]
     - Resulting matrix:
       \[
       \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
       \]

5. **Solution:**
   - The system is now in reduced row echelon form, indicating:
     \[
     x = 2, \quad y = 1
     \]

### Key Points:

- **Elementary Matrices:** Each elementary matrix corresponds to a specific row operation applied to the identity matrix.
  
- **Row Operations:**
  - Scaling a row by a non-zero scalar.
  - Adding a multiple of one row to another row.
  - Swapping two rows.

- **Order Matters:** The order in which you apply these operations is crucial, as each step builds on the previous one.

### Practice:

To master this technique, practice applying these steps to different systems of equations. This will help reinforce understanding and ensure accuracy when performing transformations.

By following these steps, you can systematically solve linear systems using elementary matrices, which also lays the groundwork for more advanced topics like LU decomposition and finding matrix inverses.

The text suggests that while some mathematical exercises might seem pointless in theory, they are necessary for exam preparation. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding LU decomposition, which will be discussed in future sessions. Additionally, the plan is to use elementary matrices as part of this exploration tomorrow.
