Before we go and look at another example, when the geometric series converges, or if it does,
there's going to be three situations with a geometric series, with a power series, sorry, I mean power series.
This is my power series, and then x minus c to the power of p, one of three things are going to happen.
It is either going to diverge no matter what the value of x is, it's always going to diverge,
that is going to be my possibility, number one, it diverges completely.
Two is going to be, it converges only on, well, let's see, it's going to converge always,
from negative infinity to infinity, so x is an element, x is an element of the real number line.
Number three, it's going to converge, converge only on c, only on c.
So x equals c is the only place where this will converge.
Then we're going to get the last possibility, it's going to converge, when we're going to have,
when we're going to have, let me just see, I've got c minus r.
Now, x is an element of this c minus r to c plus r, c plus r, sorry about that, I used at the other values.
Okay, so c minus r to c plus r, in other words, there is going to be this radius of convergence.
Here the radius of convergence, here the radius of convergence was smaller than infinity, so it's all of that.
Here we're going to have a radius of convergence, and that is going to be some distance,
of course, this radius less than c, or larger than c, and only on that domain is this power series going to converge.
So we're always going to have one of the situations.
Let's do some examples to see where we land in those four.
Here we have a power series, and we want to know for what values are x, if indeed any, because the first one was, well, it diverges always, will x converge?
And the main test you could use, this is the ratio test, to test for absolute or conditional, then convergence.
So we can tell the limit.
And is this a power series, well, yes, there's my b of k, there's my x minus c to the power of k, so that is indeed a power series.
We're going to have the limit as k goes to infinity of the absolute value of a k plus 1.
So here we're going to have, we're going to have 10 to the power of k plus 1, so that will be 10 to the power of k times 10.
And we're going to have x minus 1 to the power of k, and we're going to have x minus 1, which will give us x minus 1 to the power of k plus 1.
And we're going to have a k plus 1, which is going to be k plus 1, which is going to be k plus 1, we did that in the previous video, times k factorial.
Now we're going to multiply that by the reciprocal of this, which is going to be k factorial, so I'm just skipping a lot of steps.
You should know how this works by now, 10 to the power of k, there, and we're going to have x minus 1 to the power of k, absolute value of that.
So a lot of things can probably go, indeed, that will go, that will go, 10 to the power of k will go, x minus 1 will go, x minus 1 will go, so what are we left with?
We are left with the limit as k goes to infinity, as k goes to infinity, what do we have left?
We have left, we have left a 10, and we're left of x minus 1, and we are left a, we are left a, we are left a k plus 1, we are left a k plus 1, and this is all actually value.
Now this limit only pertains to k, so I can bring this out, so that's going to be 10 times, that's the value of x minus 1, times the limit.
This k goes to infinity, this k goes to infinity, you can see where this is going, of 1 over k plus 1, and that equals 0, and that is just going to equal 0, and it's going to be less than 1.
There's no x's involved here.
Okay, 10 times the absolute value of k minus 1 times the limit, this k goes to infinity, or 10 to infinity, 1 over k plus 1, it's just 0, and 0 is less than 1.
And there's no, there's no x in here, so this series will converge, because 0 is less than 1, this limit is, this limit is less than 1, so this thing is going to converge absolutely, converge absolutely, for x is the element of the real numbers.
So from negative infinity to positive infinity, it doesn't matter what value of x we choose here, this series is always going to converge.
Let's test for convergence.
Is this a power series, indeed, my c is just 0, and my b is 1 over k times 4 to the power of k.
Let's say the best test we can use is the ratio test, let's do that, the ratio test says the limit is k goes to infinity, of, let's do a, k plus 1,
so I am going to be left with x k, I am going to be left with x, I am going to be left with k plus one, and I am going to be left with 4k,
I am going to be left with 4, then I am going to be another k, another 4 to the power k , and an x to the power of k.
Okay, let's see what we can get rid of
We can get rid of this term
We can get rid of 4 to the power of k
4 to the power of k
Is that what I did before? Let me just see
Remember now, x does not take part in this limit
So it's going to be the actual value of x
Divided by 4 does not take part
And then I'm going to have the limit
The limit is k goes to infinity of k over k plus 1
30 values of that
If I just plug it in, it is infinity of infinity
That doesn't work
My second problem attack
Divide and eliminate the denominator
The largest power variable in the denominator
So that's going to be k divided by k
Which is 1 over 1 plus 1 over k
That will be 0, so I'm left with 1
In other words, I'm left with an L value for my limit
And my original value is x over 4
I need this to be less than 1
So I'm going to have the actual value of x divided by 4
It's going to be less than 1
In other words, the actual value of x is going to be
Less than 4
In other words, negative 4 smaller than x
Smaller than 4
Now, I urged you before
With the previous problem, we didn't look at it
But we now just have to look at what happens at negative 4
And what happens at 4
So, we'll have to take the limit again
As k goes to infinity
Let's use a 4
Of the absolute value of
Now, this is going to be 4
Let me just write it this
And now I'm looking at
k equals 0
To infinity of
4 to the power of k
Divided by
K
And 4 to the power of k
So, if I do 8
K plus 1
I'm going to be left with
4 to the power of k
And I'm going to be left with
4
And I'm going to be left with
K plus 1
Now, is that absolutely necessary
For me to go all this way?
I am wasting my time
Am I not?
Do not do this
Simplify
Look at this
4 over k
4 over k
So, I'm looking at
I am basically looking at
The series
K equals 0
To infinity
Of 1 over k
Which I know to be
The harmonic series
Which diverges
Now, immediately we know
That 4 cannot be included
This must be
This must be there
Now, what about
Negative 4?
What about
Negative 4?
So, now I'm going to have
Negative 4
To the power of k
And then 4 to the power of k
Let's look at that
Now, you can't just make that
You can't just make this
Negative 1
But let's go
I don't know if it's really correct
Let's just go the wrong way
So, I'm going to have
The limit
As k goes to infinity of
I'm going to have
Negative 4
To the power of k
And plus 1
So, I'm going to have
Another negative 4
And that is going to be
Over k plus 1
And then it's going to be
Over a 4k and a 4
4 to the power of k
And a 4
And then the reciprocal of that
And then the reciprocal of that
As it stands
Is going to be k
That's going to be
4 to the power of k
And then it's going to be
A negative 4
To the power of k
Actually, the value of all of that
This will disappear
And that will disappear
We have a 4 to the power of k
And 4 to the power of k
So, the negative 4
And this is going to go
And here we'll just have
A negative 1
Which does not take part
So, I'm going to have
Negative 1 times the limit
Times the limit of k
As it goes to infinity of
K
Over k plus 1
Absolutely better than that
We've already seen
We've already seen
That that equals 1
Negative 1 times 1 is 1
So, I'm left with
Negative 1
Which indeed is less than 1
And we said
If the limit is less than 1
It converges absolutely
In other words
Negative 4 is included
So, I'm going to have x
As an element there
X is going to be from
Negative 4
To 4
On that side
So, 4 is not included
But negative 4 is included
That's why it's so important then
To plug in
These values
To plug in these values
To see what happens
Because the ratio test
Does not tell you
What happens
At the extreme
Of your
Of your domain there
Let's do a quick example
Where
The series will only converge
For one single x value
And just look at this
You can just look at this
And see
By the kth test
And then as k goes to infinity
Remember that
It must
If you think about the series
You're going to have something
By something
By something
By something
The only way that it really converges
Is that
Every time you add something
It's got to get smaller
It's got to get smaller
It's got to get to 0
In the end
You've got to add 0
If you do that
Then
Obviously
The series converges
So by the kth test
You can see
The only way that we can
We're going to get the kth
Or then the infinite element
There to be 0
Is when x equals 5
Because 5 minus 5 is 0
It doesn't matter what k is in
We'll have a 0
But let's
Let's just look at it
So we're going to have the limit
By the ratio test
This k tends to infinity
Of
We're going to have k plus 1
Times k factorial
We're going to have an x minus 5
To the power of k
And we're going to have an x minus 5
And the absolute value of that
And we're going to divide by k factorial
And we're going to have an x minus 5
To the power of k
So that will go
And that will go
K factorial will go
K factorial will go
The x minus 5
Does not take part in the limit
So that's x minus 5
Times the limit
This k goes to infinity of
That's the value of k plus 1
And that is infinity
But the only way that this is going to
Go to a certain
Limit called l
Is when x equals 5
When x equals 5
Then this limit equals 0
Which is less than 1
Which is less than 1
So it will converge
And the only place where it's going to converge
Is x equals 5
For any x not equal to 5
L is definitely going to be more than 1
Inclusive of
We were saying inclusive of infinity
And that means it diverges
So a series where you can clearly see
That it will only converge for one single x value
And that x value is going to be c
Because you see that c equals 5
So remember what you said
They all diverge
They converge only
For all x values
Then converge only for
For x equals c
And this is one of those
And then there will be a c minus r
And a c plus r
And that r
Is then your radius of convergence
Around c
So remember I think it will converge
So remember
Where you are
Instead of a place in
Th бр
Where who die
