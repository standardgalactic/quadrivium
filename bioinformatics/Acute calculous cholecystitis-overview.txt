The text discusses acute cholecystitis as a common complication of gallstones seen in the Q-Care Surgery Unit at Grytiskir Hospital. Acute cholecystitis occurs when a gallstone lodges in the cystic duct, leading to inflammation and edema of the gallbladder wall, venous congestion, immune cell infiltration, and patchy necrosis due to impaired blood flow.

Key points include:
- **Prevalence**: It is more common in females across various age groups.
- **Symptoms**: Patients typically experience persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain lasting hours to days, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, tachycardia, and dehydration.
- **Diagnosis**: A raised white cell count with neutrophilia, possible dehydration indicated by raised urea, normal bilirubin, and ultrasound findings of gallstones, thickened gallbladder wall, and pericolecystic fluid are common. A positive Murphy's sign on physical examination is also diagnostic.
- **Treatment**: Initial management includes IV fluids, electrolyte monitoring, analgesia, and antibiotics. The definitive treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy), ideally performed within three to seven days after diagnosis to minimize complications.

The text emphasizes that while some patients may have asymptomatic gallstones detected on ultrasounds, not all progress to acute cholecystitis. It also notes logistical challenges in performing timely surgeries due to late presentations and overbooked operating theaters.

The text discusses treatment approaches for acute calculus cholecystitis. Typically, patients are treated with antibiotics and sent home until their condition improves, at which point they undergo an elective cholecystectomy six weeks later. Ideally, if diagnosed early, patients would have the cholecystectomy immediately.

For those who do not improve with antibiotics, a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is inserted as a newer treatment option. However, there's uncertainty about its long-term management and aftercare, prompting research to better understand outcomes for these patients. Percutaneous drains are also used in severely ill patients with comorbidities who cannot undergo surgery. The passage summarizes the standard and alternative treatments for acute calculus cholecystitis.
