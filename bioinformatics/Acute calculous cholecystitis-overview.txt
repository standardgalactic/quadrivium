The text discusses acute cholecystitis as a common complication of gallstones seen in the Q-Care Surgery Unit at Grytiskir Hospital. Acute cholecystitis occurs when a gallstone lodges in the cystic duct, leading to inflammation and edema of the gallbladder wall, venous congestion, immune cell infiltration, and patchy necrosis due to impaired blood flow.

Key points include:
- **Prevalence**: It is more common in females across various age groups.
- **Symptoms**: Patients typically experience persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain lasting hours to days, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, tachycardia, and dehydration.
- **Diagnosis**: A raised white cell count with neutrophilia, possible dehydration indicated by raised urea, normal bilirubin, and ultrasound findings of gallstones, thickened gallbladder wall, and pericolecystic fluid are common. A positive Murphy's sign on physical examination is also diagnostic.
- **Treatment**: Initial management includes IV fluids, electrolyte monitoring, analgesia, and antibiotics. The definitive treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy), ideally performed within three to seven days after diagnosis to minimize complications.

The text emphasizes that while some patients may have asymptomatic gallstones detected on ultrasounds, not all progress to acute cholecystitis. It also notes logistical challenges in performing timely surgeries due to late presentations and overbooked operating theaters.

The text discusses treatment approaches for acute calculus cholecystitis. Typically, patients are treated with antibiotics and sent home until their condition improves, at which point they undergo an elective cholecystectomy six weeks later. Ideally, if diagnosed early, patients would have the cholecystectomy immediately.

For those who do not improve with antibiotics, a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is inserted as a newer treatment option. However, there's uncertainty about its long-term management and aftercare, prompting research to better understand outcomes for these patients. Percutaneous drains are also used in severely ill patients with comorbidities who cannot undergo surgery. The passage summarizes the standard and alternative treatments for acute calculus cholecystitis.

The text discusses acute cholecystitis as a common complication of gallstones observed at Grytiskir Hospital. Acute cholecystitis occurs when a gallstone lodges in the cystic duct, leading to inflammation and possible infection. Key characteristics include persistent right upper quadrant pain, nausea, fever, and elevated white cell count with neutrophilia. Ultrasound is used for diagnosis, showing stones, thickened gallbladder walls, and possibly pericholecystic fluid.

The condition predominantly affects middle-aged females but can occur across all age ranges. Patients may present with varying symptoms; however, pain typically persists for days rather than hours as in biliary colic. Initial treatment includes symptomatic relief with IV fluids, analgesia, and antibiotics. The definitive treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy), ideally performed within three to seven days to reduce complications associated with delayed surgery.

The text also highlights challenges in timely surgery due to late presentations and theatre overbooking, which may increase complication risks if cholecystectomy is postponed beyond the acute phase. Additionally, while most patients have normal liver function tests, some exhibit elevated cellular enzymes or alkaline phosphatase levels. A non-invasive nuclear medicine test (HIDAS scan) can also aid in diagnosis, although its reliability depends on the patient's fasting status.

The text discusses treatment approaches for acute calculus cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder due to stones). The ideal scenario involves early intervention with immediate cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder). However, when patients present late and do not improve with antibiotics, a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is used. This tube drains the gallbladder and is relatively new, leading to uncertainty about its optimal management, such as duration of use and post-treatment steps. Research is ongoing in this area to better understand patient outcomes with these drains. In severely ill patients or those with significant comorbidities who cannot undergo surgery, percutaneous drainage is also utilized. This procedure provides a temporary solution until the patient can safely have surgery.
