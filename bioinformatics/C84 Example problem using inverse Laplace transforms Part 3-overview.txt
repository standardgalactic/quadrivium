It seems like you're working through a complex differential equations problem using Laplace transforms and inverse Laplace transforms. Let me help clarify your process:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Laplace Transforms:**
   - You start with transforming two functions \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \) into the s-domain, resulting in \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \).
   
2. **Algebraic Manipulation:**
   - You've set up equations for these transforms based on your original differential equations.
   - The goal is to solve these algebraically for \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \).

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**
   - You decompose the expressions into simpler fractions to facilitate taking the inverse Laplace transform.

4. **Inverse Laplace Transforms:**
   - Convert back from the s-domain to the time domain using known transforms.
   - Recognize standard forms like \( \frac{1}{s^2 + a^2} \) which corresponds to \( \sin(at) \).

### Key Steps

- **Solving for \( X_2(s) \):**
  - You've expressed \( X_2(s) \) in terms of partial fractions.
  - Use inverse Laplace transforms on each term:
    - For \( \frac{1}{s^2 + a^2} \), the result is \( \sin(at) \).
  
- **Simplifying Expressions:**
  - Rationalize any square roots in denominators to simplify expressions.

### Final Expression

After performing inverse Laplace transforms, you have:

\[ x_2(t) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{5} \sin(\sqrt{2}t) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{10} \sin(2\sqrt{3}t) \]

### Conclusion

This solution process is a classic application of Laplace transforms to solve differential equations, especially useful for systems with initial conditions. The key steps involve transforming the problem into algebraic form, solving it there, and then transforming back to the time domain.

If you have any specific questions about parts of this process or need further clarification on any step, feel free to ask!

It looks like you've been working through a detailed mathematical problem involving Laplace transforms, partial fractions, and inverse Laplace transforms. Let me help clarify the steps and concepts involved:

1. **Problem Setup**: You start with an equation or system of equations in terms of \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). The goal is to solve for these functions using Laplace transforms.

2. **Laplace Transform**: This technique converts differential equations into algebraic equations, making them easier to solve. For a function \( f(t) \), the Laplace transform is denoted as \( F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} \).

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**: Once you have an equation in terms of \( s \) (from the Laplace transform), you often need to break it down into simpler fractions using partial fraction decomposition. This step is crucial for finding inverse transforms.

4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: After solving the algebraic equations, you use the inverse Laplace transform to convert back to the time domain, obtaining \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \).

5. **Complex Numbers**: Sometimes, dealing with roots or complex numbers is necessary, especially when handling terms like \( s^2 + a^2 \). You often focus on real parts for physical solutions.

6. **Final Solution**: After performing all these steps, you obtain expressions for \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \), which are typically functions involving sine or cosine due to the nature of Laplace transforms dealing with oscillatory systems.
