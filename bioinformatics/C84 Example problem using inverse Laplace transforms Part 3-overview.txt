It seems like you're working through a complex differential equations problem using Laplace transforms and inverse Laplace transforms. Let me help clarify your process:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Laplace Transforms:**
   - You start with transforming two functions \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \) into the s-domain, resulting in \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \).
   
2. **Algebraic Manipulation:**
   - You've set up equations for these transforms based on your original differential equations.
   - The goal is to solve these algebraically for \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \).

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**
   - You decompose the expressions into simpler fractions to facilitate taking the inverse Laplace transform.

4. **Inverse Laplace Transforms:**
   - Convert back from the s-domain to the time domain using known transforms.
   - Recognize standard forms like \( \frac{1}{s^2 + a^2} \) which corresponds to \( \sin(at) \).

### Key Steps

- **Solving for \( X_2(s) \):**
  - You've expressed \( X_2(s) \) in terms of partial fractions.
  - Use inverse Laplace transforms on each term:
    - For \( \frac{1}{s^2 + a^2} \), the result is \( \sin(at) \).
  
- **Simplifying Expressions:**
  - Rationalize any square roots in denominators to simplify expressions.

### Final Expression

After performing inverse Laplace transforms, you have:

\[ x_2(t) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{5} \sin(\sqrt{2}t) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{10} \sin(2\sqrt{3}t) \]

### Conclusion

This solution process is a classic application of Laplace transforms to solve differential equations, especially useful for systems with initial conditions. The key steps involve transforming the problem into algebraic form, solving it there, and then transforming back to the time domain.
