The text introduces the concept of flux within the framework of vector calculus, particularly emphasizing its application in fluid dynamics. It begins by reviewing line integrals, previously discussed in terms of work done by a force over distance using a dot product between a vector field \( f \) and a differential path element \( dr \). In this context, \( f \) represents a force, while \( dr \) indicates the direction along a path.

The discussion then shifts from considering the vector field as representing force to viewing it as a velocity field in fluid dynamics. Here, flux measures how much of a fluid (gas or liquid) passes through a given line over time, focusing on the perpendicular component to the path rather than parallel. This is captured using a normal vector \( n \), which conventionally points right relative to \( dr \). The flux through a line segment is described by the line integral \( f \cdot n \, ds \), where \( ds \) represents an infinitesimal length of the curve and \( n \) gives direction perpendicular to this element. This quantifies the volume of fluid flowing across a line within a given time.

The concept extends from lines in two dimensions to surfaces in three-dimensional space. For surfaces such as spheres, flux is calculated using surface integrals of the dot product between the vector field and the normal vector at each point on the surface. This represents the volume of fluid passing through the entire surface over an infinitesimal time period.

The text underscores that these calculations involve surface integrals to determine three-dimensional flux across surfaces in vector fields, applicable to both closed (like spheres) and open surfaces, showcasing how to apply this concept to various geometric shapes.
