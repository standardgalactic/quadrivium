Here's a concise summary of the text:

To find the tangent plane to a function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) in 3D space:

1. **Graph Representation**: The function is seen as a surface, with contours representing curves on this surface.

2. **Gradient and Tangent Plane**:
   - Calculate the gradient of \( f(x, y) \), which is \( \nabla f = (2x, 2y) \).
   - At a point like \( (1, 1) \), the gradient is \( (2, 2) \).

3. **Higher-Dimensional Method**:
   - Introduce \( g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z \) to represent the surface.
   - The gradient of \( g \) is \( (2x, 2y, -1) \).

4. **Tangent Plane Calculation**:
   - At a point on the surface such as \( (1, 1, 2) \), compute the gradient: \( (2, 2, -1) \).
   - Use this gradient to derive the tangent plane equation by forming a dot product with a vector from the known point to an arbitrary point \( (x, y, z) \).

5. **Tangent Plane Equation**:
   - The equation simplifies to \( z = 2x + 2y - 2 \).
   - This result matches that obtained through local linearization.

The text illustrates two methods for finding the tangent plane: direct gradient calculation and a higher-dimensional contour approach, both yielding consistent results.
