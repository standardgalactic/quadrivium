Now let's try something slightly more advanced.
Again, I won't bore you with using eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
You see there, 1, negative 4, e to the power 2t, 1 and 1, e to the power 7t.
And that is going to be my solution there.
But look at my f of t.
I have 6t and negative 10t plus 4.
What to do with that?
Well, this is re-righted slightly.
It's always good just to bunch things together.
6, negative 10.
Bunch is just a silly word.
t plus, we've got 0 and 4.
So it's 6 and negative 10t plus 0 and 4.
If you were to multiply that out, you get exactly that.
So where does that leave us for our particular solution, x of p?
Well, we're definitely going to have, not just a sub 1, b sub 1, but here we're going to have an a sub 2, b sub 2, t, plus a sub 1, b sub 1, just the two constants.
So there's two constants, there's two constants, I call them something different.
Now, where is that going to leave us?
What is x prime?
What is x prime of p?
Well, that is just going to be, well, that is just going to be, that's a constant, that's a constant, t is to the power 1, so I'm just going to have a sub 2, b sub 2.
So instead of having 0, 0 on this side, I'm going to have a sub 2, b sub 2, and I've got to do this whole multiplication here.
So I'm going to have the fact that a sub 2, b sub 2, that is going to equal, I've got to multiply this matrix A by x of p.
So it's going to be 6 times this, this part, plus 1 times this part, and then 4 and 3 we're going to have, so let's do that.
So let's do that.
Let's just rewrite this as, I can rewrite this as a sub 2, t, plus a sub 1, and I can write this as b sub 2, t, plus b sub 1.
Now, it would be the same, this, and that would be the same, the same thing.
So I've got to multiply this by matrix A there.
So it's 6 times the first line, plus 1 times the second, and then 4 and 3.
So let's just write that out properly, 6 and 1, 4 and 3, and this we've got to multiply it by this.
So that's a sub 2, t, plus a sub 1, and b sub 2, t, plus b sub 1.
So I've got to multiply those with each other, and lo and behold, what would I get?
Well, let's not write that one here, let's just do the multiplication.
Let's just do that.
So we're going to have 6 times a sub 2, t, plus 6 times a sub 1, plus b sub 2, t, plus b sub 1.
That's going to be the first one.
And the second part to that is going to be the 4 and the 3.
So that's 4 times a sub 2, t, plus 4 times a sub 1, plus 3 times b sub 2, t, plus 3 times b sub 1.
We have that.
Now remember, that is only this part.
I still have to add this part.
I still have to add this, but remember, it's x of p that we're dealing with.
So it's this section that we're adding.
I'm adding plus x of p.
What we do need to remember, though, is that even though we're using this, don't get confused with it.
So this is exactly what we start with.
So I had to put in x prime, and I had to put in x of p prime and x.
This we leave here.
So that will be plus 6t.
And this will be negative 10t plus 4.
And that equals, remember, a sub 2, b sub 2.
So that's my whole system that I have this.
So I've got two equations in two unknowns.
Now I see I can do something immediately.
There's a t.
There's a t.
There's a t.
So I can have 6 times a sub 2.
That one will be gone.
Plus b sub 2.
Plus b sub 2.
So that one's gone.
Plus a 6 times t.
And what am I left with?
Plus 6 times a sub 1.
Plus b sub 1.
A sub 1, b sub 1.
We're bringing it over to this side.
Negative a sub 2.
And that's going to equal to 0.
And I'll put b's in brackets as well.
Here I can do exactly the same thing.
I'll have 4 times a sub 2.
Plus a 3 times b sub 2.
Negative 10.
And that will be with a t.
Negative 10 with a t.
So I've got 4.
I've got the 3.
I've got that one.
And let's see.
What do we have left?
Then we have a positive.
We have 4 times a sub 1.
Plus 3 times b sub 1.
We have a plus 4 still here.
And minus b sub 2.
With these in brackets equal to 0.
So we have those two equations.
But we have four unknowns.
But look at it very carefully.
For this to be equal to 0.
This must equal 0.
0 times t is 0.
And if this equals 0.
And I have 0 plus 0.
That equals 0.
So in the same layer.
And that's why I bought the t out.
Specific.
So I can really have 6 times a sub 2.
Plus b sub 2.
It's going to equal negative 6.
And I have 4 times a sub 2.
Plus 3 times b sub 2.
Equals 10.
That's going to equal 10.
And on this side.
I've got 6 times a sub 1.
Plus b sub 1.
Minus a sub 2.
Minus a sub 2 is going to equal 0.
And we have 4 times a sub 1.
Plus 3 times b sub 1.
Plus 4 minus b sub 2 equals 0.
Those are my equations.
And look at this.
Two equations and two unknowns.
I can solve.
And I'll have a sub 2.
And I'll have b sub 2.
I can put in the value for a sub 1 there.
The value for b sub 2 there.
And once I have that.
Again I have two equations and two unknowns.
A sub 1 and b sub 1.
I can solve that.
Let's clear the board.
And I'll carry on solving these.
So let's use linear algebra again for that.
I'm going to have 6, 1.
And negative 6.
And I'm going to have 4, 3, 10.
4, 3, 10.
And there we go.
So let's solve.
Let's solve for this first one.
So I suppose I can divide everything by 6.
I'll have 1.
I'll have 6.
And I'll have negative 1.
And here I'll have 1 and 3 over 4.
And 10 over 4.
10 over 4.
Well, let's just leave it at that.
And so that will be my first one.
And now it's always good rather not to immediately take these two fractions
because that is just the way problems arise.
But let's try and do that.
Let's see if we can get through without me making a mistake.
I can just keep that.
And negative 1.
Let's just subtract that 1 minus 1 is 0.
And now we're going to have 1 over 6 minus 3 over 4.
1 over 6 minus 3 over 4.
And I think we can make that over 12.
So that will be 2 minus 9.
Is that correct?
Is that correct?
Let's just have a quick look.
1 over 6 minus 3 over 4.
Oh, it's difficult to do these fractions.
So that means 6 times 2, 6 times 2, 4 times 8 over 9 is negative 7 over 12.
Negative 7 over 12 we can have there.
And we have minus 4 over 4 and we subtract from that negative 10 over 4.
And we're going to have negative 14 over 4.
Negative 14 over 4 it seems there.
So what can we do?
We can multiply this by negative 12 over 7 and this by negative 12 over 7.
So we'll have 1, 6, negative 1.
And here we'll have 0.
We'll have 1.
So that negative and negative would go.
4 goes into itself 1.
So it goes into there 3 times.
7 goes into itself 1.
So it goes into there 2 times.
So that leaves me with a 6 over there.
And if I multiply this by negative 1 over 6, I'm going to get that.
And if I multiply that by negative 1 over 6, I get a negative 1.
So, lo and behold, we're going to get 1, we're going to get a 0, we're going to get a negative 2.
We're going to get a 0, we're going to get a 1 multiplied throughout by negative.
So we'll get a 6.
Is that correct, babe?
Let's just have a quick look.
Let's just have a quick look.
0, and that's a positive 1A, and that's a positive there as well.
So that's correct.
Okay.
So we have the fact that A sub...
What are we dealing with here?
We were dealing with A sub 1, A sub 2.
A sub 2, B sub 2.
And that is going to equal a negative 2, negative 2 and 6.
So it's a bit boring to watch me do this.
You can definitely fast forward, pause, and do your own one.
Let's say it's so easy with these.
Fortunately, we have the internet and various calculators and software that can just do this for you.
So that leaves us there with 6 times A sub 1.
That leaves us with 6 times A sub 1 plus B sub 1, I think.
Plus B sub 1 minus A sub 2, which is negative 2.
So that's positive 2.
So that equals negative 2.
And we have 4 times A sub 1 plus we have 3 times B sub 1.
And now we're going to have plus 4 minus 6 minus 2.
Bring it to the other side and equals 2.
So we're going to have 6, 1, negative 2.
And we're going to have 4, 3, 2.
And we just have to do those operations.
Okay.
So again, to say you shouldn't do these distractions when you do these, it makes it quite difficult to do.
So let's try something else.
Let's multiply this one by 2.
If I multiply the first row by 2, I'm going to get 12.
I'm going to do that 2.
I'm going to get negative 4.
And if I multiply this by negative 3, I'm going to get negative 12, negative 9, and negative 6.
That's what I'm going to get.
So we'll have 12, 2, negative 4.
Let's just add these for that one.
So that's a 0.
That's a negative 7.
And if I just add those two to negative 10, I can immediately change this just to 7 and 10.
7 and 10.
And if I multiply...
There's so many ways to do this.
If I multiply 7 and 2 is 14.
If I multiply this by 7, let's just multiply that first one by 7.
Shall we do that?
And let's just see.
If I multiply that by 7, what's 12 times 7 is 14.
It's 84.
What am I thinking of?
That's 84.
7 times 2 is 14.
And what is that?
7 times 4 is negative 28.
Is that correct?
And if I multiply this by...
Let's multiply this by negative 2.
So that's a 0, that's a negative 14 and a negative 20.
Is that right?
I hope there's no mistakes.
Okay.
If I add those two, I'm going to get an 84.
I'm going to get a 0.
And I'm going to get a negative 48.
Negative 48.
And here I'm going to get a 0, a 14 and a 20.
A 0, a 14, a 20.
Now we just have to simplify.
So we've got to do 48.
So we've got to divide by 84.
That's 1, 0.
And I've got to take 84.
And I've got to divide it by 48.
Okay.
With a negative in the front.
So I can divide, I suppose, by 4 and 4.
Divide by 4.
That's negative 2.
1 over 1 plus 2.
And like that.
And 3.
And I can divide both by 3.
That's negative 7 over 3 is 4.
Negative 7 over 4, it seems like that.
That's negative 7 over 4.
I wonder if I...
Let me check my work before.
Divide by 48.
Oh!
48 divided by this.
So it's negative 4 over 7.
Of course.
And then divide it by 14.
That's a 0.
Divided by 14.
And 20 over 14.
20 over 14.
Divided by 2.
That's 10 over 7.
So that'll be 10 over 7.
And there we go.
So we have a solution for a sub 1 and a sub 2.
But remember, xp, remember, was a sub 2, b sub 2, t plus a sub 1, b sub 1.
So we're just going to replace that.
So we know what a sub 2, b sub 2 was from before.
With a t, we know what a sub 1, b sub 1 is now from these values.
And if we just substitute all of that, you remember, in the game, that x was going to be x sub c plus this x sub p,
which is now this, just with the values.
So we're just going to replace that.
