The text describes a process for finding the equation of a plane through specific geometric conditions. The task involves:

1. **Finding a Plane Through Two Points Perpendicular to Another Plane:**
   - You have two points, \((-1, 2, 5)\) and \( (2, 1, 4) \).
   - The plane must be perpendicular to another given plane described by the equation \(8x - 2y + 6z = 1\).
   - The normal vector of this given plane is \((8, -2, 6)\), which will be parallel to the desired plane.
   - A vector between the two points, \(\mathbf{p_1p_2} = (3, -1, -1)\), lies in the desired plane.
   - The cross product of this vector with the normal vector of the given plane yields a new normal vector for the desired plane: \((4, 13, -1)\).
   - Using point-normal form and one of the points, the equation of the plane is derived as \(4x + 13y - z = 17\).

2. **Finding a Plane Through a Point and Containing a Line:**
   - The plane must pass through the point \((1, -1, 2)\) and contain the line defined by parametric equations \(x = t\), \(y = t + 1\), \(z = 2t + 3\).
   - A vector parallel to this line is \((1, 1, 2)\).
   - Another point on the plane can be obtained from the line, for example by setting \(t = 0\) or another value.
   - The cross product of two vectors in the plane provides a normal vector.
   - Using this normal vector and the given point, the equation of the plane is found.

The process involves using vectors, cross products, and geometric relationships to derive equations of planes based on specified conditions.

The text describes a process for finding a vector perpendicular to a plane defined by two points. Here's a summary:

1. **Define Vectors**: Two vectors are created from given points:
   - Vector \( \mathbf{p} = (1, -2, 5) \)
   - Vector \( \mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 2) \)

2. **Cross Product**: The cross product of these two vectors (\( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{p} \)) is calculated to find a vector perpendicular to the plane containing them:
   - Resulting vector \( \mathbf{n} = (3, -3, -3) \)

3. **Equation of Plane**: Using vector \( \mathbf{n} \), an equation for the plane is derived:
   - The dot product of \( \mathbf{n} \) and a point on the plane (\( \mathbf{p_0} = (0, 1, -2) \)) equals zero.
   - This results in the plane equation: \( 3x - y - z - 2 = 0 \)

4. **Verification**: The process is verified to ensure accuracy in calculations.

The text emphasizes understanding vector operations and using them to derive geometric properties like a plane's normal vector and its equation.

The text outlines the process of finding equations for planes under specific conditions:

1. **Equation of a Plane through Two Points and Perpendicular to Another Plane**:
   - Given two points, \((-1, 2, 5)\) and \( (2, 1, 4) \), and a plane with equation \(8x - 2y + 6z = 1\).
   - The normal vector of this given plane is perpendicular to the desired plane.
   - To find a vector parallel to the desired plane, use the two points to form vector \(\mathbf{p_1p_2} = (3, -1, -1)\).
   - Another vector \(\mathbf{n_1} = (8, -2, 6)\) is perpendicular to the given plane.
   - The cross product of these two vectors gives a new vector normal to the desired plane: \((4, 13, -1)\).
   - Using point-normal form, the equation of the desired plane is \(4x + 13y - z = 17\).

2. **Equation of a Plane through a Point and Containing a Line**:
   - Given a point \((1, -1, 2)\) and a line with parametric equations \(x = t\), \(y = t + 1\), \(z = 2t + 3\).
   - A vector parallel to the line is \((1, 1, 2)\).
   - To find another vector in the plane, use two points on the line by substituting different values for \(t\) (e.g., \(t=0\) and \(t=1\)).
   - The cross product of these vectors gives a normal to the plane.
   - With the point \((1, -1, 2)\) and the normal vector, write the equation of the plane.

The text emphasizes using vector operations (like cross products) to find normals and formulating plane equations using point-normal forms.

The text describes a process for finding a normal vector to a plane using two points to create vectors and then computing their cross product. Here's a summary:

1. **Defining Vectors**: Two vectors, \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\), are defined using given coordinates:
   - \(\mathbf{p} = (1, -2, 5)\)
   - \(\mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 2)\)

2. **Cross Product**: The cross product of vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{p}\) is calculated to find a normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) to the plane:
   - \(\mathbf{n} = (9, -3, -3)\)

3. **Normalizing**: The vector \(\mathbf{n}\) can be simplified by factoring out a common factor, resulting in:
   - \(\mathbf{n} = (3, -1, -1)\)

4. **Equation of the Plane**: Using point \((0, 1, -2)\) on the plane and normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\), the equation of the plane is derived:
   - \(3x - y - z + 1 = 0\)

The process involves calculating the cross product to find a vector perpendicular to both given vectors, which serves as the normal to the plane. The plane's equation is then determined using this normal vector and a point on the plane.
