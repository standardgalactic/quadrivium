To solve the factoring problem \(3X + 9Y\) using SymPy in Python, follow these steps:

1. **Import SymPy and Initialize Pretty Printing:**
   Start by importing the necessary functions from SymPy and enable pretty printing for better visualization of mathematical expressions.

2. **Define the Expression:**
   Define the expression you want to factor.

3. **Factor the Expression:**
   Use the `factor` function to break down the expression into its constituent factors.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Import necessary functions from SymPy
from sympy import symbols, factor

# Initialize pretty printing
from sympy import init_printing
init_printing()

# Define the variables
X, Y = symbols('X Y')

# Define the expression to be factored
expression = 3*X + 9*Y

# Factor the expression
factored_expression = factor(expression)

# Print the factored expression
print(factored_expression)
```

### Explanation:

- **Importing SymPy:** We import `symbols` to define symbolic variables and `factor` for factoring expressions. The `init_printing()` function is used to enable pretty printing, which displays mathematical expressions in a more readable format.

- **Defining Variables:** `X` and `Y` are defined as symbolic variables using `symbols('X Y')`.

- **Expression Definition:** The expression \(3X + 9Y\) is created by combining the symbols with their coefficients.

- **Factoring:** The `factor()` function is used to factor the expression. In this case, it will extract the greatest common divisor (GCD) from the terms, which is 3, resulting in \(3(X + 3Y)\).

- **Output:** The factored expression \(3(X + 3Y)\) is printed.

This approach demonstrates how SymPy can be used to perform algebraic manipulations like factoring efficiently.

The text provides a tutorial on using the SymPy library in Python for mathematical operations such as creating symbols, performing arithmetic, and especially focusing on polynomial factorization. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Creating Symbols**: The tutorial starts by introducing how to create a new mathematical symbol (`Y`) and assign it to a variable.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**: It explains that Python follows standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), so no parentheses are needed unless you wish to alter the default precedence.

3. **Factoring Polynomials**:
   - For linear expressions, common factors can be extracted using the GCD function.
   - Examples include factoring `3X + 9Y` to `3(X + 3Y)` and verifying by expansion.
   - Polynomial expressions like `X^3 - Y^3` are factorized into `(X - Y)(X^2 + XY + Y^2)`, demonstrating that some factors cannot be simplified further.

4. **Special Cases**:
   - Difference of squares, such as `X^2 - 9`, is factored into `(X - 3)(X + 3)`.
   - Rational expressions are simplified by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.

5. **Using SymPy Functions**: The tutorial highlights using `factor()` to factor polynomials and `simplify()` for simplifying expressions, showcasing how these functions can be applied to complex problems like polynomial division.

Overall, the text illustrates the ease of performing symbolic mathematics with Python's SymPy library, making it a powerful tool for algebraic manipulations.
