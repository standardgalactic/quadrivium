To solve the factoring problem \(3X + 9Y\) using SymPy in Python, follow these steps:

1. **Import SymPy and Initialize Pretty Printing:**
   Start by importing the necessary functions from SymPy and enable pretty printing for better visualization of mathematical expressions.

2. **Define the Expression:**
   Define the expression you want to factor.

3. **Factor the Expression:**
   Use the `factor` function to break down the expression into its constituent factors.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Import necessary functions from SymPy
from sympy import symbols, factor

# Initialize pretty printing
from sympy import init_printing
init_printing()

# Define the variables
X, Y = symbols('X Y')

# Define the expression to be factored
expression = 3*X + 9*Y

# Factor the expression
factored_expression = factor(expression)

# Print the factored expression
print(factored_expression)
```

### Explanation:

- **Importing SymPy:** We import `symbols` to define symbolic variables and `factor` for factoring expressions. The `init_printing()` function is used to enable pretty printing, which displays mathematical expressions in a more readable format.

- **Defining Variables:** `X` and `Y` are defined as symbolic variables using `symbols('X Y')`.

- **Expression Definition:** The expression \(3X + 9Y\) is created by combining the symbols with their coefficients.

- **Factoring:** The `factor()` function is used to factor the expression. In this case, it will extract the greatest common divisor (GCD) from the terms, which is 3, resulting in \(3(X + 3Y)\).

- **Output:** The factored expression \(3(X + 3Y)\) is printed.

This approach demonstrates how SymPy can be used to perform algebraic manipulations like factoring efficiently.

The text provides a tutorial on using the SymPy library in Python for mathematical operations such as creating symbols, performing arithmetic, and especially focusing on polynomial factorization. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Creating Symbols**: The tutorial starts by introducing how to create a new mathematical symbol (`Y`) and assign it to a variable.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**: It explains that Python follows standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), so no parentheses are needed unless you wish to alter the default precedence.

3. **Factoring Polynomials**:
   - For linear expressions, common factors can be extracted using the GCD function.
   - Examples include factoring `3X + 9Y` to `3(X + 3Y)` and verifying by expansion.
   - Polynomial expressions like `X^3 - Y^3` are factorized into `(X - Y)(X^2 + XY + Y^2)`, demonstrating that some factors cannot be simplified further.

4. **Special Cases**:
   - Difference of squares, such as `X^2 - 9`, is factored into `(X - 3)(X + 3)`.
   - Rational expressions are simplified by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.

5. **Using SymPy Functions**: The tutorial highlights using `factor()` to factor polynomials and `simplify()` for simplifying expressions, showcasing how these functions can be applied to complex problems like polynomial division.

Overall, the text illustrates the ease of performing symbolic mathematics with Python's SymPy library, making it a powerful tool for algebraic manipulations.

In this tutorial, you are exploring symbolic mathematics using a Python library (possibly SymPy) for algebraic operations such as expansion and factoring. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process described:

### Setting Up

1. **Importing Necessary Functions:**
   - You start by importing functions from the `SymPy` package, like `expand`, and using them as methods.
   - The `init_printing()` function is used to render mathematical expressions beautifully.

2. **Creating a Symbolic Expression:**
   - Define a symbolic variable `X`.
   - Construct an expression `X * (X + 3)`.

### Expanding the Expression

1. **Expansion:**
   - Use the `.expand()` method on the expression object.
   - This distributes `X` over `(X + 3)`, resulting in `X^2 + 3X`.

### Factoring the Expression

1. **Factoring:**
   - To factor an expression, create a single object from it and use the `.factor()` method.
   - Apply this to `X^2 + 3X` to get back `X * (X + 3)`.

### Example Problem

1. **Factoring Another Expression:**
   - Consider the expression `3X + 9Y`.
   - Factor it by recognizing common factors, resulting in `3 * (X + 3Y)`.

### Key Points

- **Methods vs Functions:** 
  - Methods like `.expand()` and `.factor()` are called on objects created from expressions.
  - They can also be imported as functions if needed.

- **Symbolic Computation:**
  - The library handles algebraic manipulations symbolically, meaning it works with the mathematical structure rather than numerical approximations.

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to use a symbolic mathematics library in Python to perform algebraic operations like expansion and factoring. By leveraging methods associated with expression objects, you can manipulate and simplify mathematical expressions efficiently.

The text describes using Python's SymPy package for symbolic mathematics, particularly focusing on polynomial factorization and simplification.

1. **Symbol Creation**: The author introduces a new mathematical symbol 'Y' and assigns it as a variable in Python, demonstrating how to manipulate expressions involving variables like 'X' and 'Y'.

2. **Factorization Examples**:
   - For the expression \(3X + 9Y\), SymPy identifies the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 9, which is 3, and factors it out to get \(3(X + 3Y)\).
   - The author verifies this by expanding back to the original form, illustrating that factoring and expansion are inverse operations.
   
3. **Polynomial Factorization**:
   - For expressions like \(X^4 + X^3Y\) and \(X^3 - Y^3\), SymPy factors them into simpler components, such as \(X^3(X + Y)\) and \((X - Y)(X^2 + XY + Y^2)\).
   - The author emphasizes that certain expressions, like \(X^2 + XY + Y^2\), cannot be factored further.

4. **Simplification with Fractions**:
   - The text demonstrates simplifying a fraction where both the numerator and denominator are polynomials.
   - By factoring both parts, common terms can be canceled out, leaving a simplified expression.

5. **SymPy Methods**: 
   - SymPy's `factor` method is used to break down expressions into their simplest factors.
   - The `simplify` method reduces expressions but does not necessarily show the factorization steps.
   
Overall, the text highlights how SymPy can efficiently handle polynomial operations, making tasks like factorization and simplification straightforward in Python.
