The text is discussing radiation therapy and how different types of radiation affect biological tissue differently, measured using a concept called Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Here's a breakdown:

1. **Radiation Types and RBE:**
   - X-rays and gamma rays have an RBE of 1.
   - Beta particles (electrons) also have an RBE of 1.
   - Protons have an RBE around 10.
   - Alpha particles have an RBE ranging from 10 to 20.
   - Neutrons vary widely, but their RBE can be very high.

2. **Example Calculation:**
   - A tumor receives a dose of 12 RADs (or gray) from protons with an RBE of 10.
   - To achieve the same biological effect as 1 gray of X-rays, 10 grays of protons are needed.
   - The calculation converts RAD to gray and uses RBE to find the equivalent dose.

3. **Biological Effectiveness:**
   - Biological effectiveness is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose (in grays) by the RBE.
   - Example: For a proton dose of 12 gray with an RBE of 10, the biological effect is 120 gray-equivalent.

4. **Radiation Exposure and Health Effects:**
   - Different types of radiation have varying health effects based on their RBE.
   - High doses (above about 100 rad or 1 gray) can cause acute symptoms like nausea and hair loss.
   - Long-term exposure risks include cancer and genetic damage.

5. **Activity Calculation in Irradiation:**
   - In another example, a tumor is irradiated with particles delivering 0.4 MeV each.
   - The total energy delivered is calculated, and the activity (number of decays per second) is determined by dividing this energy by the energy per particle.

Overall, the text explains how different radiations are used in therapy, their biological impacts, and how to calculate doses and activities for effective treatment.
