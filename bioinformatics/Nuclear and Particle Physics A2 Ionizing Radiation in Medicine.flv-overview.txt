The text is discussing radiation therapy and how different types of radiation affect biological tissue differently, measured using a concept called Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Here's a breakdown:

1. **Radiation Types and RBE:**
   - X-rays and gamma rays have an RBE of 1.
   - Beta particles (electrons) also have an RBE of 1.
   - Protons have an RBE around 10.
   - Alpha particles have an RBE ranging from 10 to 20.
   - Neutrons vary widely, but their RBE can be very high.

2. **Example Calculation:**
   - A tumor receives a dose of 12 RADs (or gray) from protons with an RBE of 10.
   - To achieve the same biological effect as 1 gray of X-rays, 10 grays of protons are needed.
   - The calculation converts RAD to gray and uses RBE to find the equivalent dose.

3. **Biological Effectiveness:**
   - Biological effectiveness is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose (in grays) by the RBE.
   - Example: For a proton dose of 12 gray with an RBE of 10, the biological effect is 120 gray-equivalent.

4. **Radiation Exposure and Health Effects:**
   - Different types of radiation have varying health effects based on their RBE.
   - High doses (above about 100 rad or 1 gray) can cause acute symptoms like nausea and hair loss.
   - Long-term exposure risks include cancer and genetic damage.

5. **Activity Calculation in Irradiation:**
   - In another example, a tumor is irradiated with particles delivering 0.4 MeV each.
   - The total energy delivered is calculated, and the activity (number of decays per second) is determined by dividing this energy by the energy per particle.

Overall, the text explains how different radiations are used in therapy, their biological impacts, and how to calculate doses and activities for effective treatment.

The text discusses radiation therapy and the concept of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in treating tumors using different types of radiation. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE):**
   - RBE measures how effective a type of radiation is at causing biological damage compared to standard x-rays or gamma rays.
   - For 200 kV x-rays and gamma rays, the RBE is 1.
   - Beta particles (electrons) also have an RBE of 1.
   - Protons have a higher RBE, indicating they are more effective at causing biological damage than x-rays or gamma rays.
   - The text provides calculations for comparing different radiations based on their absorbed doses and RBE values.

2. **Example Calculations:**
   - A tumor receives an absorbed dose of 12 gray in 900 seconds from high-energy particles, each delivering 0.4 mega electron volts (MeV).
   - To find the activity (number of decays per second), the total energy delivered to the tumor is calculated using the absorbed dose and mass.
   - The number of particles required to deliver this energy is determined by dividing the total energy by the energy per particle.
   - Activity is then found by dividing the number of particles by the time interval.

3. **Conversion Factors:**
   - 1 RAD equals 0.01 gray, which is used for converting absorbed doses between units.
   - Energy conversion from electron volts to joules involves multiplying by \(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\).

4. **General Understanding:**
   - The text illustrates how different types of radiation can be compared and utilized in medical treatments based on their biological effectiveness.
   - It emphasizes the importance of understanding RBE when planning radiation therapy to ensure effective treatment while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.

Overall, the discussion revolves around calculating and comparing the effects of various radiations used in cancer treatment, focusing on absorbed doses, energy per particle, and activity.
