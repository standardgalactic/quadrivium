The text explores how mathematical models and the concept of limits are applied to address practical issues in life sciences without requiring overly complex models. It begins with a brief introduction on the importance of understanding limits for real-world applications, particularly in life sciences. 

A mathematical model example is provided that uses an equation to represent population size over time. The text poses questions about initial population size, long-term behavior, and yearly changes, demonstrating through calculations how limits can predict a stabilization of population at 60,000 people and forecast growth during specific years.

In the medical context, another model analyzes patient waiting times on surgical lists. By applying limit laws, it forecasts that waiting times will stabilize around 5.6 months.

The conclusion underscores the usefulness of mathematical models and limits in life sciences for effective planning and decision-making, especially in managing population dynamics and healthcare logistics.
