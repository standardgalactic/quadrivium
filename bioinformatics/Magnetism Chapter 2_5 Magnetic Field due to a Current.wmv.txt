Let's try and scale things up a bit and let's find out if there's a magnetic field inside of a charge carrying wire.
So this is my whole wire. And we are told that the current is uniform throughout. That's important for this derivation.
And I take an imaginary surface through symmetry. So it's a circle. I know that the circumference of a circle,
if I integrate over the whole surface, it's going to be 2 pi r. So if I start again with MP's law of b dot ds equals mu zero times i enclosed,
I'm just going to have a problem with i enclosed. Now again, a vector ds and a vector b tangent,
at that point, the angle between them is going to be zero. This is a dot product. The person of zero is ones.
The magnetic field, at least the magnitude, is going to be the same all the way around. So again, I'm just going to be left with b 2 pi r
in the previous section. And that is going to be equal mu zero times i enclosed.
Now I just have a problem with this i enclosed. Now remember where I got that from? The b was constant. I brought that out.
So this is just the integral of ds, which is then just if I bring it out. It's just s and the whole surface is 2 pi r.
Now, so let's have that b is going to equal mu zero i enclosed divided by 2 pi times small r.
But what is i enclosed? Fortunately, first we said that this is uniform. So if the current is uniform throughout,
the proportionality of the current here versus the full, so i enclosed, is simply going to be i times the ratio between the two surfaces.
So that's going to be pi r squared divided by pi capital r squared, as you can see in the corner there.
So I'm going to be left with here with mu zero.
i enclosed is then going to be i. We're going to have pi r squared divided by pi r squared plus 2 pi r.
times 2 pi r. So if my pi is there cancelled out, the one r is going to be cancelled out.
So I'm left with the magnetic field inside of the charge carrying wire.
If it is constant, i is going to be mu zero i divided by 2 pi r squared.
r is the filling, filled times r. So it will reach a maximum, it will reach a maximum at the surface there,
when this r equals, lowercase r equals capital r, and it's going to be a minimum, it's going to get smaller and smaller,
but it's r to the power of 1, so this is actually linear. So if we start, if we start at r equals zero here,
and we have a magnetic field there, this is going to be a linear progression of the magnetic field,
of the magnetic field as we go from r is zero to r there.
Just a quick short note just so that we understand the surface that we are creating.
The surface that we are creating is what we call an empyrean surface.
So if I have three charges, three currents here on the wire, i, i, and that will be negative i just by choosing that up as the positive direction.
If I draw an empyrean surface around all three of them, by empyrean's law, that's going to equal mu zero times i enclosed.
My i enclosed here, if I go through all three, that is going to be mu zero, and I'm going to have 2i minus i.
That's what we mean by that enclosed i. If I were just draw it around, but then skip this one.
So it's not included. So I'm going to have on the right side of my equation, I'm just going to have an i minus i, and that's zero.
So I'm going to actually have zero enclosed current. So it's in the general direction.
If I were just to draw around these two, I'm going to have mu zero equals, ah, mu zero times 2i.
And again, if I just draw these two, I'm also going to have i minus i.
So this is what is meant by the enclosed charge inside an empyrean surface.
So I'm going to have a mirror.
I'm going to have to draw the right side of my screen.
