The text discusses the concept of "microgravity," often used by NASA to describe conditions in space, particularly aboard the International Space Station (ISS). It clarifies that microgravity does not mean an absence of gravity; rather, astronauts and objects on the ISS still experience significant gravitational forces from Earth. However, they feel weightless because both the ISS and its occupants are in a continuous state of freefall around Earth.

This phenomenon can be explained through Newton's law of universal gravitation, which shows that while gravity acts at all distances, its strength diminishes with distance squared. The text explains how the gravitational force on an astronaut changes slightly from being on Earth's surface to orbiting aboard the ISS due to the increased distance but is not negligible.

The key reason for feeling weightless in space is orbital mechanics: the ISS is falling towards Earth but has enough tangential velocity to keep missing it, effectively staying in orbit. This creates a continuous freefall situation. An analogy with an elevator cable breaking illustrates how freefall results in weightlessness because both the object (or person) and the environment around it are accelerating at the same rate.

The term "microgravity" is used instead of zero gravity to acknowledge that while gravity's effect is greatly reduced, it is not entirely absent. This concept relates to Einstein's equivalence principle, where freefall cannot be distinguished from being far away from any gravitational forces. Thus, microgravity effectively means experiencing near-zero gravitational effects due to the state of continuous freefall.
