The text outlines a method for solving an initial value problem defined by the differential equation \(x^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = y - yx\) with the condition \(y(-1) = -1\). Here's a summary of the steps:

1. **Separate Variables**: The equation is rearranged to:
   \[
   \frac{1}{y} dy = (x^{-2} - x^{-1}) dx
   \]

2. **Integrate Both Sides**:
   - Integrate the left side to get \(\ln |y|\).
   - Integrate the right side to obtain \(-x^{-1} - \ln|x| + C\).

3. **Solve for \(y\)**: Exponentiate both sides, resulting in:
   \[
   y = c_2 \cdot \frac{e^{-1/x}}{x}
   \]
   where \(c_2\) is a constant.

4. **Apply Initial Condition**: Use \(y(-1) = -1\) to find \(c_2\):
   - Substitute \(x = -1\) and \(y = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     -1 = \frac{c_2}{-e^{-1}}
     \]
   - Solve for \(c_2\) to get \(c_2 = \frac{1}{e}\).

5. **Final Solution**: Substitute \(c_2\) back into the expression for \(y\):
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{x e^{1 + 1/x}}
   \]

This is the solution to the initial value problem.
