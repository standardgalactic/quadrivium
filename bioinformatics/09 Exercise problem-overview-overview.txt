The text provides a logical proof for the equality \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \) using set operations. The proof demonstrates this by showing that each side is a subset of the other, thus establishing their equality.

1. **Definitions**:
   - Intersection (\(\cap\)) refers to elements common to both sets.
   - Union (\(\cup\)) includes all elements from either set.

2. **Proof Strategy**:
   - Prove two subset relationships for equality:
     1. \( A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \)
     2. \( (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \subseteq A \cap (B \cup C) \)

3. **First Direction**:
   - Assume \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).
   - This implies \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \), leading to \( X \in (A \cap B) \) or \( X \in (A \cap C) \), thus \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).

4. **Second Direction**:
   - Assume \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - This means \( X \in A \cap B \) or \( X \in A \cap C \), implying \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \), leading to \( X \in A \) and \( X \in (B \cup C) \), thus \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Both subset relationships are established, confirming the sets are equal: \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - The proof demonstrates the distributive property of intersection over union in set theory.

This structured approach validates the equality through mutual subset inclusion.
