The text provides a logical proof for the equality \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \) using set operations. The proof demonstrates this by showing that each side is a subset of the other, thus establishing their equality.

1. **Definitions**:
   - Intersection (\(\cap\)) refers to elements common to both sets.
   - Union (\(\cup\)) includes all elements from either set.

2. **Proof Strategy**:
   - Prove two subset relationships for equality:
     1. \( A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \)
     2. \( (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \subseteq A \cap (B \cup C) \)

3. **First Direction**:
   - Assume \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).
   - This implies \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \), leading to \( X \in (A \cap B) \) or \( X \in (A \cap C) \), thus \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).

4. **Second Direction**:
   - Assume \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - This means \( X \in A \cap B \) or \( X \in A \cap C \), implying \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \), leading to \( X \in A \) and \( X \in (B \cup C) \), thus \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Both subset relationships are established, confirming the sets are equal: \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - The proof demonstrates the distributive property of intersection over union in set theory.

This structured approach validates the equality through mutual subset inclusion.

The text provides a logical proof for the set expression \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \), demonstrating this equality by showing that each side is a subset of the other. The proof uses basic set definitions: intersection (\(\cap\)) contains elements common to both sets, while union (\(\cup\)) includes all elements in either set.

To prove equality, the strategy involves two parts:
1. **First Direction**: Show \( A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - Assume an element \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \). This means \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \), so \( X \) is in either \( A \cap B \) or \( A \cap C \), making \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).

2. **Second Direction**: Show \( (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \subseteq A \cap (B \cup C) \).
   - Assume an element \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \). This implies \( X \in A \cap B \) or \( X \in A \cap C \), so \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \), leading to \( X \in A \) and \( X \in (B \cup C) \), thus \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).

The proof concludes by confirming that both subset relationships are satisfied, establishing the equality of the two set expressions. This demonstrates the distributive property of intersection over union in set theory.
