The text discusses the calculation of energy consumption and discharge time for a battery in an electrical circuit. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Energy Consumption Calculation:**
   - A 5-ampere current runs through a circuit for 6 minutes (360 seconds) using a rechargeable battery with a 6-volt EMF.
   - Power is calculated as \( P = IV \), where \( I \) is the current and \( V \) is the voltage. Here, power equals 30 watts (joules per second).
   - The total energy consumed over 360 seconds is calculated by multiplying power by time: \( 30 \times 360 = 10,800 \) joules, approximately 11 kilojoules.

2. **Car Battery Discharge Calculation:**
   - A car battery with a 12-volt EMF and an initial charge of 120 ampere-hours is considered.
   - To find how long the battery can deliver energy at 100 watts:
     - Current \( I \) is calculated using \( P = IV \), giving \( I = \frac{100}{12} \approx 8.33 \) amperes.
     - Time \( T \) until discharge is found using \( T = \frac{Q}{I} \), where \( Q \) (charge in coulombs) is the initial charge converted from ampere-hours to coulombs.

The text emphasizes understanding power equations and converting units between time, current, and energy.
