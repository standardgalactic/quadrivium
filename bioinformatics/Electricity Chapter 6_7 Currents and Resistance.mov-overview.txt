The text discusses the calculation of energy consumption and discharge time for a battery in an electrical circuit. Here’s a summary:

1. **Energy Consumption Calculation:**
   - A 5-ampere current runs through a circuit for 6 minutes (360 seconds) using a rechargeable battery with a 6-volt EMF.
   - Power is calculated as \( P = IV \), where \( I \) is the current and \( V \) is the voltage. Here, power equals 30 watts (joules per second).
   - The total energy consumed over 360 seconds is calculated by multiplying power by time: \( 30 \times 360 = 10,800 \) joules, approximately 11 kilojoules.

2. **Car Battery Discharge Calculation:**
   - A car battery with a 12-volt EMF and an initial charge of 120 ampere-hours is considered.
   - To find how long the battery can deliver energy at 100 watts:
     - Current \( I \) is calculated using \( P = IV \), giving \( I = \frac{100}{12} \approx 8.33 \) amperes.
     - Time \( T \) until discharge is found using \( T = \frac{Q}{I} \), where \( Q \) (charge in coulombs) is the initial charge converted from ampere-hours to coulombs.

The text emphasizes understanding power equations and converting units between time, current, and energy.

The text discusses a problem involving electrical power and energy in circuits. It begins by calculating the energy consumed when a 5-ampere current is set up in a circuit for 6 minutes using a rechargeable battery with an EMF of 6 volts. The energy is calculated as follows:

1. Convert time: 6 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 360 seconds.
2. Calculate power using \( P = IV \), where \( I = 5 \) A and \( V = 6 \) V, resulting in \( P = 30 \) watts (or joules per second).
3. Compute energy: \( E = Pt = 30 \text{ J/s} \times 360 \text{ s} = 10,800 \) joules or approximately 11 kilojoules.

The text then shifts to a problem about a car battery with an EMF of 12 volts and an initial charge of 120 ampere-hours. The goal is to determine how many hours the battery can deliver energy at a rate of 100 watts:

1. Convert ampere-hours to coulombs: \( Q = 120 \text{ A·h} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 432,000 \) coulombs.
2. Calculate current using \( P = IV \), rearranged as \( I = P/V \): \( I = 100 \text{ W}/12 \text{ V} = 25/3 \approx 8.33 \) amperes.
3. Determine the time (\( T \)) for which the battery can deliver this power: \( T = Q/I = 432,000 \text{ C}/(25/3 \text{ A}) \).

The calculation of \( T \) gives the duration in seconds, which can be converted to hours to find out how long the battery can sustain a 100-watt load. The text emphasizes understanding and applying basic electrical equations to solve these problems efficiently.
