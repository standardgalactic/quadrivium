The text discusses the associative law in mathematical expressions, highlighting its role in changing the grouping of operations without affecting the outcome. In programming languages like Julia, understanding this principle is essential because it dictates the order of expression evaluation. The example provided is \(2 - 4 \times 3\). By default, multiplication precedes subtraction, resulting in \(2 - 12 = -10\). However, using parentheses to alter grouping, such as \((2 - 4) \times 3\), changes the order: first, compute \(2 - 4\) to get \(-2\), then multiply by 3 to yield \(-6\). This illustrates how parentheses can control operation execution, similar to traditional mathematics.
