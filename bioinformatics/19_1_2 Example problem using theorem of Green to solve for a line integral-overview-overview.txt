Here’s a concise summary of the text:

1. **Problem Setup**: The task is to evaluate a line integral of the vector field \( \mathbf{f} = (2x e^y, 2x^2 e^y) \) around a closed curve formed by \( y = x^2 - 2 \) and \( y = x \).

2. **Checking Conservativeness**: The curl (\( n_x - m_y \)) of the vector field is calculated to determine if it's conservative. It’s found to be non-zero, indicating the field is non-conservative.

3. **Applying Green's Theorem**: Since the field is non-conservative, Green’s Theorem is used to transform the line integral into a double integral over the region \( R \) enclosed by the curve:
   \[
   \oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \right) \, dA
   \]

4. **Integration Process**: The double integral is set up over the region bounded by \( y = x^2 - 2 \) and \( y = x \). This involves:
   - Calculating the curl: \( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \).
   - Determining the integration limits for \( x \) and \( y \).

5. **Integration by Parts**: Integration by parts is employed to simplify part of the integral.

6. **Final Calculation**: Detailed calculations, including substitutions and simplifications, lead to the final result of the integral.

The text illustrates how Green's Theorem facilitates evaluating line integrals for non-conservative vector fields by converting them into double integrals over a specified region.
