To find the area enclosed by the curves \( y = 4 - x^2 \) and \( y = -3x \), follow these steps:

1. **Determine Intersection Points**: 
   Set the equations equal to each other: 
   \[
   4 - x^2 = -3x
   \]
   Rearrange:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0
   \]
   Factorize:
   \[
   (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   Solutions are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These are the bounds of integration.

2. **Identify Functions**:
   Let \( f(x) = 4 - x^2 \) (parabola) and \( g(x) = -3x \) (line).

3. **Set Up Integral**:
   The area between the curves from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 4 \) is given by:
   \[
   \int_{-1}^{4} [(4 - x^2) - (-3x)] \, dx = \int_{-1}^{4} (4 - x^2 + 3x) \, dx
   \]

4. **Integrate**:
   Find the antiderivative:
   \[
   \int (4 - x^2 + 3x) \, dx = 4x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{3x^2}{2}
   \]
   Evaluate from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   \left[ 4(4) - \frac{4^3}{3} + \frac{3(4)^2}{2} \right] - \left[ 4(-1) - \frac{(-1)^3}{3} + \frac{3(-1)^2}{2} \right]
   \]

5. **Calculate**:
   Substitute and simplify:
   \[
   = (16 - \frac{64}{3} + 24) - (-4 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{3}{2})
   \]
   Simplify each part:
   \[
   = (40 - \frac{64}{3}) - (-\frac{8}{3} + \frac{9}{6})
   \]
   Convert to common denominator and calculate:
   \[
   = \left(\frac{120}{3} - \frac{64}{3}\right) - \left(-\frac{16}{6} + \frac{9}{6}\right)
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{56}{3} + \frac{7}{6}
   \]
   Convert to common denominator:
   \[
   = \frac{112}{6} + \frac{7}{6} = \frac{119}{6}
   \]

The area enclosed by the curves is \(\frac{125}{6}\).

The text describes the process of finding the area between two curves: \( y = 4 - x^2 \) and \( y = -3x \). To determine this area, you first need to find where these curves intersect by solving the equation \( 4 - x^2 = -3x \), leading to \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \). Factoring gives the roots \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), so the intersection points are at \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \).

The area between these curves from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 4 \) is found by integrating the difference of the functions, \( f(x) = 4 - x^2 \) and \( g(x) = -3x \). The integrand becomes \( 4 - x^2 + 3x \).

The integral setup is:

\[
\int_{-1}^{4} (4 - x^2 + 3x) \, dx
\]

To solve this definite integral using the fundamental theorem of calculus, calculate the antiderivative:

\[
F(x) = 4x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{3x^2}{2}
\]

Evaluate \( F(x) \) at the bounds \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \):

- At \( x = 4 \):  
  \[
  F(4) = 16 - \frac{64}{3} + 24
  \]

- At \( x = -1 \):
  \[
  F(-1) = -4 + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{3}{2}
  \]

Subtract the results: 

\[
F(4) - F(-1) = \left(16 - \frac{64}{3} + 24\right) - \left(-4 + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

Converting to a common denominator (6), calculate:

\[
= \frac{96}{6} - \frac{128}{6} + \frac{144}{6} + \frac{24}{6} - \frac{2}{6} - \frac{9}{6}
\]

Simplifying this, you get the final result:

\[
= \frac{125}{6}
\]

Thus, the area between the curves is \( \frac{125}{6} \) square units.
