The text provides a detailed analysis of the convergence properties and error estimation for an alternating series with terms \( a_k = \frac{1}{k^4} \). Here is a summary:

### Series Analysis
- The series in question is an alternating series: 
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} \frac{1}{k^4}
  \]

### Convergence Test
- **Alternating Series Test (Leibniz's Test)** is used to determine convergence.
- The test requires:
  1. \( a_k = \frac{1}{k^4} \) must be monotonically decreasing, which it is because the denominator increases with \( k \).
  2. \(\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k = 0\), which holds true since \(\frac{1}{k^4}\) approaches zero as \( k \) goes to infinity.
- Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that the series converges.

### Error Estimation
- The error in approximating the sum of the series by its \( n \)-th partial sum is bounded by the absolute value of the first omitted term:
  \[
  |S - S_n| \leq a_{n+1}
  \]

#### Example Calculation
- For \( n = 40 \), the error bound is:
  \[
  |S - S_{40}| \leq \frac{1}{41^4} \approx 3.54 \times 10^{-7}
  \]
- This indicates a very small error when using \( S_{40} \).

#### Desired Accuracy
- To achieve an error less than \( 1.00 \times 10^{-10} \):
  - Solve \(\frac{1}{(n+1)^4} < 1.00 \times 10^{-10}\).
  - This implies \((n+1)^4 > 10^{10}\), leading to \( n+1 > 316.23\).
  - Therefore, \( n \geq 316 \) is required for the desired accuracy.

### Conclusion
- To ensure an error less than \( 1.00 \times 10^{-10} \), use a partial sum with at least \( n = 316 \).
- This ensures that the next term in the series is smaller than the specified tolerance, providing the necessary precision without unnecessary computational effort.
