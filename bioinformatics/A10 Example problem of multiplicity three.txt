so let's look at yet another problem I have this three by three matrix and you see it's a very
special type of matrix if you remember matrix algebra you'll see on the diagonal we have all
twos and everything zero under that okay you'll remember those matrices anyway let's look at a
minus lambda I that is going to be two minus lambda one six and we're going to have a zero
two minus lambda five and a zero is zero two minus lambda this is a matrix and we've got to get the
determinant of that but we're going to be clever about it we're going to get it along either column
one or row three because we have two zeros in there remember it'll be positive negative positive
negative positive so it's going to be that one so the determinant is going to be two minus lambda
and we're going to multiply that so we take it along this row close that off so it's going to be this
minus zero which is now this is going to be two minus lambda squared and that's going to equal zero
and then behold what do I have here it's two minus lambda cubed equals zero there's my m so this is
multiplicity three so I know I'll have an x sub one x sub two x sub three but I first need to find out
for this eigenvalue of mine now my eigenvalue being now just just have a look at this now
um you've just got to be you've just got to be careful with this uh negative here it says two
minus lambda in other words lambda equals two not negative two so lambda sub one equals two so
with this I need to find out how many how many uh eigenvectors I can get from that so if I
have a minus two times k is going to equal zero because there's the short way of doing it there's
a long way of doing it let's do the longer way maybe you can also do the augmented matrix so I'm going
to have a zero one six zero zero five zero zero zero zero and I've got to multiply that by case of one
case of two case of three and that has got to equal the zero column matrix
so what are we left with we are left with case of two plus six times case of three there
and we're left with five times case of three there and we're just left with zero there
so those two have going to equal each other we can clearly see that case of three at least
so if we just look at k case of three it's got to be a zero there and if I let that zero that means
k sub two is also going to be zero but that leaves me case of one to be anything at once because I've
got to multiply it by zero anyway and we're not going to choose zero because then we have that zero
eigenvector which means nothing so the next thing we'll put in is a one so I can put in a two there
three doesn't matter but that would just be constant multiples of this eigenvector so what I can see here
is that I can only get one eigenvector for this eigenvalue and if I can if I do that remember now I've
got to go move on to say that a minus two i times p is going to equal k that would be my next next step
remember if I could get more than one eigenvector I could have just gotten I just could have used all
of them but I can only get a single eigenvector case of one can be anything because it's multiplied
by zero and but that will just be constant multiples of this so that won't help so let's do this one now
and now it's going to equal one zero zero and that now becomes piece of one piece of two and piece of three
so again I'm going to be left with p sub two plus six times p sub three is that and p sub three is going
to equal that and lastly zero equals zero
so p sub three if I just look at p p sub three is just zero p sub three equals zero and if p sub three is
zero it means p sub two must be one I'm left with p sub one being anything I want I'm always going to
start with zero I didn't want to start with zero there otherwise it's all the same but yeah I can start
with zero and I'm still left with this with this the next one I have to do this multiplicity three
so I'll have to go to q and that is going to equal p so let's do that one
now this is going to equal zero one zero and again so that's q so it's sub one q sub two and q sub three
and so again q sub two plus six times q sub three there I'll just have five times I hope I put the five in before
and zero so now I see q sub three
q sub three five times q sub three equals one so q sub three
is going to be equal to one over five and if that's one over five so that becomes six over five so that
means q sub two is negative six over five and again q sub one can be anything but I'm going to start to start
off with a zero so there we go I have all of these now and now I've just got to remember how to construct my
general solution set my general solution set so let's look at that
for x of one I'm just going to have k what was my k remember it was that zero one zero zero okay
so that's just going to be k so that's one zero zero e to the power what was my it was two t two t
x sub two was going to be k that's one zero zero
t e to the power two t plus p was zero one zero e to the power two t and x of three was going to be
one zero zero t squared over two e to the power two t plus
p was zero negative six over five one over five e to the power two t
so there we go because I could only get one eigenvector for my eigenrepeat eigenvalue
that's what I have there and then for the general solution set it will be x equals
equals c sub one x sub one plus c sub two x sub two plus c sub three x of three x of one x of two and
x of three are not constant multiples of each other in other words they each get their own so that's going
going to be c sub one times that plus c sub two times that whole one plus c sub three plus that
c sub three times that whole one okay so this would be the general
solution it's quite easy to do
