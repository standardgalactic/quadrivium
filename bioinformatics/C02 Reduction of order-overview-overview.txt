The text describes the method of reduction of order, which is used to solve second-order linear differential equations when one non-trivial solution (\( y_1 \)) is already known over an interval \( i \). To find a general solution, another linearly independent solution (\( y_2 \)) is needed. This can be achieved by expressing \( y_2 \) as \( y = u(x) \cdot y_1 \), where \( u(x) \) is an unknown function.

The process involves using the product rule to differentiate \( y \) and substituting these derivatives back into the original differential equation. This substitution converts the problem into a new differential equation in terms of \( u' \), which can then be simplified further by setting \( w = u' \). Solving this transformed equation yields \( u(x) \).

Once \( u(x) \) is found, it is integrated to determine \( y_2 \). The general solution to the original differential equation is then a combination of the known solution \( y_1 \) and the newly determined solution \( y_2 \), forming a complete set of solutions. An example will be provided later to illustrate this method in practice for second-order linear differential equations.
