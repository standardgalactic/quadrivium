This video series covers the topic of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The discussion will address epidemiology, pathophysiology, and various risk factors. Due to underdiagnosis and varied diagnostic tests, precise incidence figures for VTE are unclear, but the lifelong risk is about 1 in 1000 patients.

VTE can be immediately life-threatening, especially pulmonary embolism, and may lead to chronic disability due to venous insufficiency over time. Prevention is emphasized as preferable to treatment.

The clotting mechanism, maintained in homeostasis by coagulation and anticoagulation systems, is crucial for repairing endothelial damage and preventing blood loss. Verco's triad—comprising intimal injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability—explains the imbalance that leads to thrombus formation.

Key risk factors include:

- **History of VTE**: Prior incidents significantly increase recurrence risk.
- **Age**: Incidence increases exponentially after age 40.
- **Major Surgery**: Particularly abdominal, pelvic, and orthopedic surgeries have high risks for VTE even with prophylaxis.
- **Malignancy**: Trousseau syndrome links cancer with thrombosis. Patients with malignancies and thrombophilias like factor V Leiden mutation or prothrombin gene mutations are at increased risk.
- **Obesity**: Especially significant in women using contraceptives.
- **Trauma**: True prevalence is hard to determine due to varied injury types and diagnostic challenges; specific fractures and major surgeries post-trauma pose higher risks.
- **Immobilization/Paralysis**: Well-known risk, with debated significance of prolonged air travel without additional risk factors.
- **Hormones**: Oral contraceptives (especially with third-generation progestogens) and hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women increase VTE risk.
- **Pregnancy and Post-partum**: VTE can occur at any stage; left leg predominance is notable.
- **Central Venous Catheters**: Particularly risky when placed in lower extremity veins.
- **Varicose Veins/Thrombophlebitis**: Associated with DVT but not causative.
- **Cardiac Disease**: Mainly due to immobilization, with high DVT incidence post-myocardial infarction.
- **Hypercoagulable States**: Includes factor V Leiden mutation and antiphospholipid syndromes among others.

Understanding these risk factors is essential for preventing and managing VTE effectively.

The text outlines an introduction to venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. It highlights the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and risk factors associated with VTE, acknowledging that precise incidence figures are uncertain due to underdiagnosis and varied diagnostic tests.

A lifelong risk of DVT or pulmonary embolism is approximately 1 in 1000 individuals. The conditions are concerning due to their potential for being immediately life-threatening (in the case of pulmonary embolism) and causing long-term chronic disability through venous insufficiency.

The discussion emphasizes prevention over treatment, referencing Verco's triad which describes unbalanced coagulation leading to thrombus formation: intimal injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability. Several risk factors are detailed:

- **History of VTE**: Patients with previous DVT or pulmonary embolism have an increased risk for recurrence.
- **Age**: Risk increases after age 40, often in conjunction with other risk factors.
- **Major Surgery**: Especially abdominal, pelvic, and orthopedic surgeries increase VTE risk despite prophylaxis.
- **Malignancy**: Particularly hematological cancers combined with thrombophilia significantly raise risk.
- **Obesity**: Mainly risky when combined with contraceptive use in women.
- **Trauma**: Risk is higher in cases of severe trauma involving specific injuries or requiring major surgery.
- **Prolonged Immobilization/Paralysis**: Known to increase VTE risk, though controversy exists regarding air travel.
- **Hormones**: Estrogen and certain contraceptives are associated with increased risk.
- **Pregnancy and Post-partum**: Notable for its left-leg predominance in VTE occurrences.
- **Central Venous Catheters**: Especially risky when placed in lower extremities.
- **Varicose Veins/Thrombophlebitis**: Associated but not causative of VTE; requires regular monitoring.
- **Cardiac Disease**: Increased risk due to immobilization, with high DVT incidence post-myocardial infarction.
- **Hypercoagulable States**: Conditions like factor V Leiden mutation and antiphospholipid syndromes significantly contribute to VTE risk.

The text underscores the complexity of VTE risk factors and the importance of early detection and preventive measures.
