The text illustrates how to construct a quotient group using the integers under addition and the normal subgroup of multiples of 3, denoted \(3\mathbb{Z}\). The goal is to form the quotient group \(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\), where cosets are created by adding integers from \(\mathbb{Z}\) to elements of \(3\mathbb{Z}\).

Three distinct cosets (equivalence classes) are identified:
1. \(0 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots\}\)
2. \(1 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -8, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, \ldots\}\)
3. \(2 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -7, -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, \ldots\}\)

These cosets partition the integers into three distinct sets, forming the elements of the quotient group: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\). The text explains that this quotient group is a valid group under addition modulo 3, satisfying properties such as closure, associativity, identity (element 0), and inverses. It contains three elements, making it isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, \(\mathbb{Z}_3\).

This example highlights the fundamental concept of quotient groups in abstract algebra, demonstrating their connection to homomorphisms and isomorphisms, specifically showing that \(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\) corresponds to \(\mathbb{Z}_3\).
