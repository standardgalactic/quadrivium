okay now we're moving on to still constant coefficients so a b and c are constants not
all zero and a definitely not zero we have y double prime y prime and y once again i remind
you the only function e to the power mx whose first and subsequent derivatives are just constant
multiples of itself is e to the power mx i've written its first derivative and its second
derivative and i've replaced that into the original equation and i've taken e to the power mx
out as a constant factor a common factor i should say so am squared plus bm plus c equals zero
this cannot be zero for all values of x so this has got to be one of the roots this has got to equal
zero and this am squared plus bm plus c is what we call the auxiliary equation so if you were given
a problem to solve with values therefore a b and c in this form you're just going to use those values
of a b and c and have this m as a substitute variable here and we call this the auxiliary
equation m squared plus bm plus c now you will remember this is a polynomial equation of order
two we solve it by m equals minus b plus minus the square root of b squared minus four ac over two a
and that's going to give us the two values for m m sub one and m sub two now you'll note that there is
going to be three forms that this can take depending on this we're going to have an m2 uh m sub one and
m sub two being real and distinct in other words they're not equal to each other if b squared minus four
ac is larger than zero if this part here is larger than zero we're going to get two values for m because
we have plus and then minus and we'll get an eventual equation in this form we're going to have
y equals some constant times e to the power m sub one x and some other constant e to the power m sub 2x
then we're going to get the fact that we might have m1 and m2 being real but equal and that happens when b
squared minus 4ac equals zero so if that equals zero it's plus minus zero so m sub one and m sub two
is just going to be negative b over 2a and then we begin to get something in this form the constant
constant e m sub one again m sub one the only difference between those there's going to be an
extra x in it and in the previous section we saw examples of this where we land up with the second with
y sub two y sub one y sub two being x e to the power something and then last is the interesting
one where m sub one and m sub two are conjugate complex numbers and that happens when b squared
minus 4ac is less than zero because then we are dealing with we are dealing with a negative square root
and then we're going to get an answer in this format where y sub one is e to the power alpha plus
this imagining number i beta x and then we have alpha minus i beta x and we're actually going to
write the final form by making use of euler's formula which states e e to the power i theta equals cosine of
theta plus the imagining number i sine of theta but we'll do some examples to show how we how we do this
