The text outlines a method for calculating the arc length of a curve defined by a position vector \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\) over an interval from \(t=a\) to \(t=b\). Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Position Vector**: Start with a given position vector \(\mathbf{r}(t)\).

2. **Velocity Vector**: Compute the derivative of \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) with respect to \(t\) to obtain the velocity vector \(\mathbf{v}(t)\).

3. **Magnitude of Velocity (Speed)**: Calculate the magnitude, or speed, as the square root of the sum of squared components of the velocity vector.

4. **Arc Length**: Integrate the speed over the interval from \(t=a\) to \(t=b\) to find the arc length \(L\).

An example is provided with \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (2t, \ln(t), t^2)\) for \(t=1\) to \(t=e\). The steps include:

- Finding the velocity vector: \((2, \frac{1}{t}, 2t)\).
- Calculating its magnitude: \(\sqrt{4 + \frac{1}{t^2} + 4t^2}\).
- Simplifying the integrand to \(2t + \frac{1}{t}\).

The integral of this simplified expression from 1 to \(e\) results in an arc length of \(e^2\). The text highlights the importance of understanding algebraic manipulation and simplification before using computational tools. Future discussions will explore deriving position and velocity from given acceleration, involving antiderivatives (integrals) to reverse-engineer these processes.
