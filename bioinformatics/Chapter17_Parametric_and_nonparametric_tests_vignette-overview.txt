In this final lecture series, the focus is on calculating real p-values. Before that, an important discussion is needed: choosing between parametric and non-parametric tests for statistical analysis. Selecting the appropriate test is crucial for accurate results, so it's emphasized to understand the differences and applications of each type of test.

In this final lecture of the series, the focus is on calculating real p-values, with an essential discussion on choosing between parametric and non-parametric tests for statistical analysis. Understanding which test to use is crucial in ensuring accurate results, as each type of test has specific assumptions and applications depending on the data's characteristics. The upcoming content will delve deeper into these two types of statistical tests, helping you make informed decisions in your analyses.
