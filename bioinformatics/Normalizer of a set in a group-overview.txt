To understand the concept presented in your text, we need to delve into some group theory concepts related to normalizers and bijections.

### Normalizer

The **normalizer** \( N_G(A) \) of a subset \( A \) in a group \( G \) is defined as:
\[ N_G(A) = \{ g \in G \mid gAg^{-1} = A \}. \]
This means that for every element \( g \) in the normalizer, conjugation by \( g \) leaves the subset \( A \) invariant.

### Mapping and Bijection

You introduced a mapping \( \sigma_g: A \to A \), defined by:
\[ \sigma_g(a) = gag^{-1}. \]

To show that this mapping is bijective (one-to-one and onto), you need to establish both injectivity and surjectivity:

- **Injectivity**: If \( \sigma_g(a_1) = \sigma_g(a_2) \), then \( ga_1g^{-1} = ga_2g^{-1} \). Multiplying by \( g^{-1} \) on the left and \( g \) on the right gives \( a_1 = a_2 \).

- **Surjectivity**: For every \( b \in A \), there exists an \( a \in A \) such that \( \sigma_g(a) = b \). Since \( gAg^{-1} = A \), for any \( b \in A \), we can find \( a = g^{-1}bg \in A \) such that \( gag^{-1} = b \).

### Two-Sided Inverse

The mapping \( \sigma_g \) is invertible, and its inverse \( \sigma_{g^{-1}} \) is given by:
\[ \sigma_{g^{-1}}(b) = g^{-1}bg. \]

You showed that:
- \( \sigma_g(\sigma_{g^{-1}}(a)) = a \)
- \( \sigma_{g^{-1}}(\sigma_g(b)) = b \)

This confirms that \( \sigma_g \) is indeed bijective.

### Implications

The bijection implies that conjugation by elements of the normalizer preserves the structure of \( A \). This property is crucial in various areas of group theory, such as understanding symmetry and stabilizers within groups.

In summary, your text outlines how the normalizer of a subset \( A \) in a group \( G \) can be characterized through bijections induced by conjugation. This approach highlights the structural preservation under conjugation, which is fundamental to many applications in algebra.

The text discusses concepts related to mappings, subgroups, and the neutralizer (often referred to as the normalizer) within group theory in mathematics.

1. **Mappings**: It explains that there is a one-to-one and onto mapping between elements using a two-sided inverse, allowing for substitutions without loss of generality or meaning. This implies a strong form of equivalence between elements under certain operations.

2. **Neutralizer (Normalizer)**: The text introduces the concept of a neutralizer in group theory, which is essentially the set of elements that stabilize another subset under conjugation. Specifically, if \( G \) is an element of this neutralizer, then its inverse is also within it, and their composition results in the identity element.

3. **Subgroups**: If a subset \( A \) becomes a subgroup of \( G \), it implies \( A \) must be closed under group operations, have associativity, include inverses for all elements, and contain an identity element. This makes \( A \) not just any subset but a structured algebraic entity with these properties.

4. **Normal Subgroups**: The text further specifies that if \( A \) is a subgroup of the normalizer of \( A \) in \( G \), it becomes a normal subgroup. This occurs because for \( A \) to be normal, conjugating any element of \( A \) by an element from the group results in an element still within \( A \).

5. **Properties and Proofs**: The passage emphasizes how properties like inverses and closure allow one to deduce other elements' existence (such as identity). Once a mapping is shown to be bijective, it simplifies proofs concerning these structures.

Overall, the text outlines the theoretical framework for understanding mappings and subgroup relations within groups, emphasizing the special role of normal subgroups in group theory.
