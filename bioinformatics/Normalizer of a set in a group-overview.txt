To understand the concept presented in your text, we need to delve into some group theory concepts related to normalizers and bijections.

### Normalizer

The **normalizer** \( N_G(A) \) of a subset \( A \) in a group \( G \) is defined as:
\[ N_G(A) = \{ g \in G \mid gAg^{-1} = A \}. \]
This means that for every element \( g \) in the normalizer, conjugation by \( g \) leaves the subset \( A \) invariant.

### Mapping and Bijection

You introduced a mapping \( \sigma_g: A \to A \), defined by:
\[ \sigma_g(a) = gag^{-1}. \]

To show that this mapping is bijective (one-to-one and onto), you need to establish both injectivity and surjectivity:

- **Injectivity**: If \( \sigma_g(a_1) = \sigma_g(a_2) \), then \( ga_1g^{-1} = ga_2g^{-1} \). Multiplying by \( g^{-1} \) on the left and \( g \) on the right gives \( a_1 = a_2 \).

- **Surjectivity**: For every \( b \in A \), there exists an \( a \in A \) such that \( \sigma_g(a) = b \). Since \( gAg^{-1} = A \), for any \( b \in A \), we can find \( a = g^{-1}bg \in A \) such that \( gag^{-1} = b \).

### Two-Sided Inverse

The mapping \( \sigma_g \) is invertible, and its inverse \( \sigma_{g^{-1}} \) is given by:
\[ \sigma_{g^{-1}}(b) = g^{-1}bg. \]

You showed that:
- \( \sigma_g(\sigma_{g^{-1}}(a)) = a \)
- \( \sigma_{g^{-1}}(\sigma_g(b)) = b \)

This confirms that \( \sigma_g \) is indeed bijective.

### Implications

The bijection implies that conjugation by elements of the normalizer preserves the structure of \( A \). This property is crucial in various areas of group theory, such as understanding symmetry and stabilizers within groups.

In summary, your text outlines how the normalizer of a subset \( A \) in a group \( G \) can be characterized through bijections induced by conjugation. This approach highlights the structural preservation under conjugation, which is fundamental to many applications in algebra.

The text discusses concepts related to mappings, subgroups, and the neutralizer (often referred to as the normalizer) within group theory in mathematics.

1. **Mappings**: It explains that there is a one-to-one and onto mapping between elements using a two-sided inverse, allowing for substitutions without loss of generality or meaning. This implies a strong form of equivalence between elements under certain operations.

2. **Neutralizer (Normalizer)**: The text introduces the concept of a neutralizer in group theory, which is essentially the set of elements that stabilize another subset under conjugation. Specifically, if \( G \) is an element of this neutralizer, then its inverse is also within it, and their composition results in the identity element.

3. **Subgroups**: If a subset \( A \) becomes a subgroup of \( G \), it implies \( A \) must be closed under group operations, have associativity, include inverses for all elements, and contain an identity element. This makes \( A \) not just any subset but a structured algebraic entity with these properties.

4. **Normal Subgroups**: The text further specifies that if \( A \) is a subgroup of the normalizer of \( A \) in \( G \), it becomes a normal subgroup. This occurs because for \( A \) to be normal, conjugating any element of \( A \) by an element from the group results in an element still within \( A \).

5. **Properties and Proofs**: The passage emphasizes how properties like inverses and closure allow one to deduce other elements' existence (such as identity). Once a mapping is shown to be bijective, it simplifies proofs concerning these structures.

Overall, the text outlines the theoretical framework for understanding mappings and subgroup relations within groups, emphasizing the special role of normal subgroups in group theory.

To understand the discussion about normalizers and mappings in group theory, letâ€™s break down the key concepts:

1. **Normalizer Definition**: 
   - For a subset \( A \) of a group \( G \), the normalizer of \( A \) in \( G \), denoted as \( N_G(A) \), is the set of elements \( g \in G \) such that for all \( a \in A \), the conjugate \( gag^{-1} \) is also in \( A \). Formally, 
     \[
     N_G(A) = \{ g \in G \mid gAg^{-1} = A \}
     \]

2. **Normalizer Properties**:
   - The normalizer contains \( A \) itself because conjugating by elements of \( A \) will leave \( A \) invariant.
   - It is a subgroup of \( G \), meaning it satisfies the group axioms (closure, identity, inverses, and associativity).

3. **Mapping with Conjugation**:
   - The mapping described involves taking an element \( g \in N_G(A) \) and conjugating every element \( a \in A \). This maps elements of \( A \) to other elements within \( A \), i.e., the map \( \sigma_g: A \to A \) defined by \( \sigma_g(a) = gag^{-1} \).

4. **Bijectivity**:
   - The mapping is bijective (one-to-one and onto). This means every element in \( A \) has a unique image under this conjugation, and every element of \( A \) can be reached.
   - To show bijectivity, you demonstrate that there exists an inverse map. For the conjugation map \( \sigma_g(a) = gag^{-1} \), the inverse is given by \( \sigma_{g^{-1}}(a') = g^{-1} a' g \). Applying these consecutively returns the original element:
     \[
     \sigma_{g^{-1}}(\sigma_g(a)) = g^{-1}(gag^{-1})g = a
     \]
     \[
     \sigma_g(\sigma_{g^{-1}}(a')) = g(g^{-1}a'g)g^{-1} = a'
     \]

5. **Implications**:
   - The fact that \( \sigma_g \) is bijective implies the structure of \( A \) remains unchanged under conjugation by elements in its normalizer.
   - This property ensures that the action of conjugating by any element of the normalizer doesn't "distort" \( A \); it merely permutes its elements.

In summary, the discussion revolves around understanding how the normalizer of a subset within a group acts on that subset via conjugation. The bijective nature of this action (understood through mappings) is crucial as it preserves the structure of the set under these transformations. This concept is fundamental in studying symmetry and stability properties within groups.

The text discusses the concept of the normalizer of a subgroup within a group \( G \). Here's a summary:

1. **One-to-One and Onto Mapping**: The author explains how a mapping is established between elements, showing it as one-to-one and onto through a two-sided inverse.

2. **Neutralizer and Identity Element**: If an element \( G \) belongs to the neutralizer of a subset \( A \), its inverses also belong there. Composing these gives the identity element, demonstrating closure and the presence of the identity without needing to prove it each time.

3. **Subgroup and Normal Subgroup**: By turning \( A \) into a subgroup of \( G \) (by adding a binary operation), \( A \) becomes part of its neutralizer in \( G \). More importantly, \( A \) becomes a normal subgroup because conjugating elements by those in the neutralizer results in elements still within \( A \).

4. **Properties of Normal Subgroup**: The text highlights that for \( A \) to be a normal subgroup, it must satisfy properties like inverses and closure under the group operation, which are inherited from \( G \). Associativity is assumed as part of the group structure.

5. **Conclusion on Normalizer**: The normalizer of a subgroup \( A \) in \( G \) ensures that conjugating any element by those within the neutralizer results in elements still within \( A \), reinforcing \( A \)'s status as a normal subgroup.
