The text outlines an alternative method to calculate the volume of a cylinder using double integrals by converting from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. Here's a summary:

1. **Context and Setup**: The problem involves finding the volume between the base of a cylinder and a plane \( z = h \). In Cartesian coordinates, this requires integrating over a circular region defined by \( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \).

2. **Conversion to Polar Coordinates**:
   - Points in the xy-plane are expressed as \((r, \theta)\) in polar coordinates, where \( r \) is the radius and \(\theta\) is the angle.
   - The area element changes from \( dx\,dy \) to \( r\,dr\,d\theta \), reflecting a transformation from rectangles to circular sectors.

3. **Integration Process**:
   - The integration bounds are set with \( r \) ranging from 0 to \( a \) and \(\theta\) from 0 to \(2\pi\).
   - The integral is set up as: \(\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{a} r \, dr \, d\theta\).

4. **Calculation**:
   - The inner integral with respect to \(r\) results in \(\frac{1}{2} a^2\).
   - Integrating this over \(\theta\) from 0 to \(2\pi\) yields the volume as \(\pi a^2 h\).

5. **Conclusion**: By converting to polar coordinates, the integration process is simplified, leading to the familiar cylinder volume formula: \( V = \pi r^2 h \). This demonstrates how changing coordinate systems can streamline volume calculations using double integrals.
