The text explains the concept of an "identity element" in a set equipped with a binary operation. An identity element \( u \) has the property that for any element \( x_1 \) in the set, the result of applying the binary operation to \( u \) and \( x_1 \), or vice versa (\( u \cdot x_1 = x_1 \cdot u = x_1 \)), is simply \( x_1 \). The text highlights that if an identity element exists for a commutative binary operation on a set, it must be unique.

Examples given include:
- In the integers with addition as the binary operation, 0 serves as the identity because adding 0 to any integer doesn't change the integer.
- In the integers with multiplication, 1 is the identity since multiplying any integer by 1 leaves it unchanged.

The uniqueness of an identity element is demonstrated through a proof by contradiction. Assuming there are two identity elements \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \), each must satisfy the condition that when used in the binary operation with the other, they yield themselves (\( p_1 \cdot p_2 = p_2 \) and \( p_2 \cdot p_1 = p_1 \)), leading to \( p_1 = p_2 \). This contradiction proves that if an identity element exists under these conditions, it is indeed unique.

The text concludes with statements unrelated or unclear in relation to the mathematical discussion of identity elements.
