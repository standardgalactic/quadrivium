To find the area between the curves \( y = \sqrt{x} \) and \( y = x - 2 \), we need to determine two regions, as these functions intersect within different intervals. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Determine Intervals:**
   - The first interval starts at \( x = 0 \). At this point, \( y = \sqrt{x} = 0 \).
   - To find where the line \( y = x - 2 \) intersects the x-axis, set \( x - 2 = 0 \), which gives \( x = 2 \).

2. **First Region (from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \)):**
   - In this interval, we need the area under the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \).
   - Integrate \( \int_{0}^{2} \sqrt{x} \, dx \):
     \[
     \int \sqrt{x} \, dx = \int x^{1/2} \, dx = \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}
     \]
   - Evaluate from 0 to 2:
     \[
     \left[ \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} \right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{2}{3}(2^{3/2}) - \frac{2}{3}(0) = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}
     \]

3. **Find Intersection Point for Second Region:**
   - Set \( \sqrt{x} = x - 2 \).
   - Squaring both sides gives \( x = (x - 2)^2 \), leading to:
     \[
     x = x^2 - 4x + 4
     \]
     \[
     x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0
     \]
   - Solving this quadratic equation: 
     \((x-4)(x-1) = 0\) gives \( x = 4 \) and \( x = 1 \).
   - Check which solution is valid in the first quadrant:
     - At \( x = 1 \), \( y = \sqrt{1} = 1 \) and \( y = 1 - 2 = -1 \). This does not work.
     - At \( x = 4 \), both equations give \( y = 2 \).

4. **Second Region (from \( x = 2 \) to \( x = 4 \)):**
   - Here, \( y = \sqrt{x} \) is the upper function and \( y = x - 2 \) is the lower.
   - Calculate the area between these curves:
     \[
     \int_{2}^{4} (\sqrt{x} - (x - 2)) \, dx = \int_{2}^{4} (\sqrt{x} - x + 2) \, dx
     \]
   - Integrate each term separately:
     \[
     \int \sqrt{x} \, dx = \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}, \quad \int x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2, \quad \int 2 \, dx = 2x
     \]
   - Evaluate from 2 to 4:
     \[
     \left[ \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x \right]_{2}^{4}
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     \left( \frac{2}{3}(4^{3/2}) - \frac{1}{2}(4^2) + 2(4) \right) - \left( \frac{2}{3}(2^{3/2}) - \frac{1}{2}(2^2) + 2(2) \right)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \left( \frac{16}{3} - 8 + 8 \right) - \left( \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} - 2 + 4 \right)
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{16}{3} - \left( \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} + 2 \right)
     \]

5. **Total Area:**
   - Sum the areas from both regions:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} + \left( \frac{16}{3} - \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} - 2 \right)
     \]
   - Simplify to get the final result.

The text involves a mathematical calculation process. It starts with simplifying an expression to "2 thirds" and proceeds through various arithmetic operations involving powers, roots, and basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, division). The steps include:

1. Calculating \(4^3\), resulting in 8.
2. Subtracting \(4^2\) (which is 16) from 8.
3. Dividing the result by 2 to get -4.
4. Adding \(2 \times 4\) results in a cancellation, maintaining the value as "2 thirds."
5. Additional steps involve further calculations with square roots and arithmetic operations, leading to an expression involving "10 minus 4 times the square root of 2 divided by 3."

The text concludes by summing two areas expressed as fractions over a common denominator of 3: \( \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} + \frac{10 - 4\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \). This result represents the total area between certain curves and the x-axis. There is an error correction process, leading to the final answer being \( \frac{10}{3} \).

To find the area between the curves \( y = \sqrt{x} \), the x-axis, and \( y = x - 2 \), we break the problem into two parts:

1. **First Part (from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \)):**
   - We need the area under \( y = \sqrt{x} \).
   - Set up the integral: \(\int_{0}^{2} \sqrt{x} \, dx\).
   - Evaluate: 
     \[
     \int \sqrt{x} \, dx = \int x^{1/2} \, dx = \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}
     \]
   - Calculate from 0 to 2:
     \[
     \left[\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}\right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{2}{3}(2^{3/2}) - \frac{2}{3}(0^{3/2}) = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}
     \]

2. **Second Part (from \( x = 2 \) to \( x = 4 \)):**
   - Find the intersection of \( y = \sqrt{x} \) and \( y = x - 2 \).
   - Set \(\sqrt{x} = x - 2\), square both sides: \(x = (x - 2)^2\).
   - Solve: \(x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0\) gives roots \(x = 1, 4\). Only \(x = 4\) is valid in the first quadrant.
   - Calculate area between curves:
     \[
     \int_{2}^{4} (\sqrt{x} - (x - 2)) \, dx = \int_{2}^{4} (\sqrt{x} - x + 2) \, dx
     \]
   - Evaluate:
     \[
     \int (\sqrt{x} - x + 2) \, dx = \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x
     \]
   - Calculate from 2 to 4:
     \[
     \left[\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x\right]_{2}^{4}
     \]
   - Substitute and simplify:
     \[
     = \left(\frac{2}{3}(4^{3/2}) - \frac{1}{2}(4^2) + 2(4)\right) - \left(\frac{2}{3}(2^{3/2}) - \frac{1}{2}(2^2) + 2(2)\right)
     \]
     \[
     = \left(\frac{16}{3} - 8 + 8\right) - \left(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} - 2 + 4\right)
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{16}{3} - \left(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} + 2\right)
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{16}{3} - \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} - 2
     \]

Combine both parts to get the total area.

The text involves solving a mathematical problem related to areas under curves. The process begins with substituting values into an expression, leading to intermediate calculations such as powers, roots, and arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Key steps include:

1. Calculating \(4^3\) which is 64, then finding the square root gives approximately 8.
2. Performing various arithmetic operations: subtracting 16 (from \(4^2\)), dividing by 2, adding products of numbers, and simplifying expressions.
3. Noticing that certain terms cancel each other out.
4. Arriving at a simplified expression involving fractions and roots.
5. Identifying a common denominator to combine two areas under curves: \(\frac{4}{3}\sqrt{2}\) and \(\frac{10 - 4\sqrt{2}}{3}\).
6. Adding these expressions results in the total area between the curves, which simplifies to \(\frac{10}{3}\).

The final result is that the total area between the given curves and the x-axis is \(\frac{10}{3}\).
