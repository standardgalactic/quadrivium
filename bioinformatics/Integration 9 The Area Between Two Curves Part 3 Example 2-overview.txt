To find the area between the curves \( y = \sqrt{x} \) and \( y = x - 2 \), we need to determine two regions, as these functions intersect within different intervals. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Determine Intervals:**
   - The first interval starts at \( x = 0 \). At this point, \( y = \sqrt{x} = 0 \).
   - To find where the line \( y = x - 2 \) intersects the x-axis, set \( x - 2 = 0 \), which gives \( x = 2 \).

2. **First Region (from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \)):**
   - In this interval, we need the area under the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \).
   - Integrate \( \int_{0}^{2} \sqrt{x} \, dx \):
     \[
     \int \sqrt{x} \, dx = \int x^{1/2} \, dx = \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}
     \]
   - Evaluate from 0 to 2:
     \[
     \left[ \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} \right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{2}{3}(2^{3/2}) - \frac{2}{3}(0) = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}
     \]

3. **Find Intersection Point for Second Region:**
   - Set \( \sqrt{x} = x - 2 \).
   - Squaring both sides gives \( x = (x - 2)^2 \), leading to:
     \[
     x = x^2 - 4x + 4
     \]
     \[
     x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0
     \]
   - Solving this quadratic equation: 
     \((x-4)(x-1) = 0\) gives \( x = 4 \) and \( x = 1 \).
   - Check which solution is valid in the first quadrant:
     - At \( x = 1 \), \( y = \sqrt{1} = 1 \) and \( y = 1 - 2 = -1 \). This does not work.
     - At \( x = 4 \), both equations give \( y = 2 \).

4. **Second Region (from \( x = 2 \) to \( x = 4 \)):**
   - Here, \( y = \sqrt{x} \) is the upper function and \( y = x - 2 \) is the lower.
   - Calculate the area between these curves:
     \[
     \int_{2}^{4} (\sqrt{x} - (x - 2)) \, dx = \int_{2}^{4} (\sqrt{x} - x + 2) \, dx
     \]
   - Integrate each term separately:
     \[
     \int \sqrt{x} \, dx = \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}, \quad \int x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2, \quad \int 2 \, dx = 2x
     \]
   - Evaluate from 2 to 4:
     \[
     \left[ \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x \right]_{2}^{4}
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     \left( \frac{2}{3}(4^{3/2}) - \frac{1}{2}(4^2) + 2(4) \right) - \left( \frac{2}{3}(2^{3/2}) - \frac{1}{2}(2^2) + 2(2) \right)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \left( \frac{16}{3} - 8 + 8 \right) - \left( \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} - 2 + 4 \right)
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{16}{3} - \left( \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} + 2 \right)
     \]

5. **Total Area:**
   - Sum the areas from both regions:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} + \left( \frac{16}{3} - \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} - 2 \right)
     \]
   - Simplify to get the final result.

The text involves a mathematical calculation process. It starts with simplifying an expression to "2 thirds" and proceeds through various arithmetic operations involving powers, roots, and basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, division). The steps include:

1. Calculating \(4^3\), resulting in 8.
2. Subtracting \(4^2\) (which is 16) from 8.
3. Dividing the result by 2 to get -4.
4. Adding \(2 \times 4\) results in a cancellation, maintaining the value as "2 thirds."
5. Additional steps involve further calculations with square roots and arithmetic operations, leading to an expression involving "10 minus 4 times the square root of 2 divided by 3."

The text concludes by summing two areas expressed as fractions over a common denominator of 3: \( \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} + \frac{10 - 4\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \). This result represents the total area between certain curves and the x-axis. There is an error correction process, leading to the final answer being \( \frac{10}{3} \).
