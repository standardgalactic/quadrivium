To solve for the magnetic force on a moving proton near an infinitely long current-carrying wire, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Magnetic Field Due to the Wire
The magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) around an infinite straight wire is determined using Amp√®re's law:

\[
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\]

- \( B \): Magnitude of the magnetic field.
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A} \): Permeability of free space.
- \( I \): Current through the wire.
- \( d \): Perpendicular distance from the wire.

The direction of \( \mathbf{B} \) is found using the right-hand rule: with thumb pointing in the current's direction, fingers curl around indicating \( \mathbf{B} \)'s path. Above the wire, it points out of the plane (positive z-direction).

In vector form:

\[
\mathbf{B} = \left(0, 0, \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Determine Magnetic Force on a Moving Proton
The Lorentz force law gives the force \( \mathbf{F} \) on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field:

\[
\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
\]

- \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \): Charge of the proton.
- \( \mathbf{v} = (0, -v, 0) \): Proton's velocity vector, downward.
- \( \mathbf{B} = \left(0, 0, \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) \).

### Step 3: Compute the Cross Product
Calculate \( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \):

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
0 & -v & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\end{vmatrix}
= \mathbf{i} \left((-v) \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
= -v \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d} \, \mathbf{i}
\]

Thus, the force \( \mathbf{F} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{F} = q \left(-v \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}\right) \mathbf{i} = -q v \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d} \mathbf{i}
\]

### Conclusion
The magnetic force on the proton is directed in the negative x-direction (leftward, assuming rightward as positive), with a magnitude:

\[
F = q v \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}
\]

This force acts perpendicular to both the proton's velocity and the direction of the magnetic field.
