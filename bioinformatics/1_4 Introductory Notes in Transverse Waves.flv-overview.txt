The text discusses expressing longitudinal waves in terms of transverse waves using examples with metal bars. 

In the first example, a 40 cm metal bar drops on the floor, and a wave travels through it at 5,500 m/s. The fundamental frequency is determined by setting up a standing wave pattern with nodes and antinodes, similar to an open tube. The simplest setup has a node in the middle of the bar, creating two quarter wavelengths (λ/4) within its length, making one full wavelength (λ) equal to 80 cm. The fundamental frequency is calculated using \( f = \frac{v}{\lambda} \).

In the second example, a 2-meter metal bar clamped at 50 cm has a fundamental resonant frequency of 3 kHz when struck by a tiny hammer, setting up longitudinal waves. The clamping point acts as a node and the free ends as antinodes. From the length between fixed points (1.5 meters), the setup includes four quarter wavelengths, making one full wavelength equal to the bar's total length (2 meters). Using \( v = f \cdot \lambda \), the speed of the wave is calculated.

The text illustrates how understanding wave patterns and boundary conditions allows for analyzing longitudinal waves by drawing parallels with transverse waves in resonant systems.

The text discusses the concept of setting up the same fundamental frequency in two different pipes under identical conditions—same room temperature and atmospheric pressure. One pipe is closed at one end (closed-open) while the other can be either open at both ends or closed at both ends.

1. **Fundamental Frequency**: 
   - In a closed-open pipe, the fundamental wave consists of a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end, fitting a quarter wavelength (\(\lambda/4\)) in the length \(L_1\) of the pipe.
   - For an open-open or open-closed pipe, the fundamental frequency corresponds to half a wavelength (\(\lambda/2\)) fitting within its length \(L_2\).

2. **Wavelength and Length Relationship**:
   - In both pipes, under identical conditions (same velocity of sound), the wavelength is the same.
   - For the closed-open pipe: \[ L_1 = \frac{\lambda}{4} \]
   - For the open-ended pipe: \[ L_2 = \frac{\lambda}{2} \]

3. **Equating Frequencies**:
   - Since the sound wave velocity is constant, and we want both pipes to have the same fundamental frequency (\(f_1 = f_2\)), we equate their wavelength expressions.
   - By setting up the equation: 
     \[ 4L_1 = 2L_2 \]
   - Solving gives: 
     \[ L_2 = 2L_1 \]

This means that for both pipes to have the same fundamental frequency, the open-ended pipe must be twice as long as the closed-open one. The text emphasizes understanding these relationships and visualizing them with diagrams of nodes and antinodes in different configurations.
