The text discusses expressing longitudinal waves in terms of transverse waves using examples with metal bars. 

In the first example, a 40 cm metal bar drops on the floor, and a wave travels through it at 5,500 m/s. The fundamental frequency is determined by setting up a standing wave pattern with nodes and antinodes, similar to an open tube. The simplest setup has a node in the middle of the bar, creating two quarter wavelengths (λ/4) within its length, making one full wavelength (λ) equal to 80 cm. The fundamental frequency is calculated using \( f = \frac{v}{\lambda} \).

In the second example, a 2-meter metal bar clamped at 50 cm has a fundamental resonant frequency of 3 kHz when struck by a tiny hammer, setting up longitudinal waves. The clamping point acts as a node and the free ends as antinodes. From the length between fixed points (1.5 meters), the setup includes four quarter wavelengths, making one full wavelength equal to the bar's total length (2 meters). Using \( v = f \cdot \lambda \), the speed of the wave is calculated.

The text illustrates how understanding wave patterns and boundary conditions allows for analyzing longitudinal waves by drawing parallels with transverse waves in resonant systems.

The text discusses the concept of setting up the same fundamental frequency in two different pipes under identical conditions—same room temperature and atmospheric pressure. One pipe is closed at one end (closed-open) while the other can be either open at both ends or closed at both ends.

1. **Fundamental Frequency**: 
   - In a closed-open pipe, the fundamental wave consists of a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end, fitting a quarter wavelength (\(\lambda/4\)) in the length \(L_1\) of the pipe.
   - For an open-open or open-closed pipe, the fundamental frequency corresponds to half a wavelength (\(\lambda/2\)) fitting within its length \(L_2\).

2. **Wavelength and Length Relationship**:
   - In both pipes, under identical conditions (same velocity of sound), the wavelength is the same.
   - For the closed-open pipe: \[ L_1 = \frac{\lambda}{4} \]
   - For the open-ended pipe: \[ L_2 = \frac{\lambda}{2} \]

3. **Equating Frequencies**:
   - Since the sound wave velocity is constant, and we want both pipes to have the same fundamental frequency (\(f_1 = f_2\)), we equate their wavelength expressions.
   - By setting up the equation: 
     \[ 4L_1 = 2L_2 \]
   - Solving gives: 
     \[ L_2 = 2L_1 \]

This means that for both pipes to have the same fundamental frequency, the open-ended pipe must be twice as long as the closed-open one. The text emphasizes understanding these relationships and visualizing them with diagrams of nodes and antinodes in different configurations.

The text discusses how longitudinal waves can be analyzed by setting them up similarly to transverse waves. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Metal Bar Example (Longitudinal Wave as Transverse):** 
   - A 40 cm metal bar is dropped, creating a wave traveling at 5,500 m/s.
   - To find the fundamental frequency and wavelength:
     - The setup is analogous to an open tube with nodes and antinodes, resulting in one node at the center.
     - This corresponds to two quarter wavelengths fitting into the 40 cm length (λ = 80 cm).
     - Using \(v = f \times λ\), where \(v\) is velocity, the fundamental frequency \(f\) is calculated as \(v / (2 \times λ)\).

2. **Clamped Metal Bar Example:**
   - A 2 m metal bar clamped at 50 cm is struck, resonating at a fundamental frequency of 3 kHz.
   - The setup creates a standing wave with nodes and antinodes:
     - One node at the clamp (fixed point) and an antinode at the free end.
     - This corresponds to one complete wavelength fitting into the 2 m length.
     - Using \(v = f \times λ\), where \(λ\) equals the bar's length, the wave speed is calculated as \(f \times L\).

3. **Conceptual Understanding:**
   - The text illustrates how understanding transverse waves helps in analyzing longitudinal waves by visualizing nodes and antinodes.
   - It emphasizes that the simplest standing wave patterns (fundamental frequencies) are crucial for determining wave properties like speed and frequency.

The examples show practical applications of wave theory, demonstrating how constraints (like clamping or open ends) influence wave behavior.

The text discusses the relationship between the length of pipes and their fundamental frequencies when closed at different ends, aiming to achieve the same frequency for two setups: a pipe closed at one end and another open at both ends. 

### Key Concepts:

1. **Wavelength and Frequency Relationship**:
   - For a pipe closed at one end (closed-open), the fundamental mode features a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end, fitting a quarter of a wavelength inside the pipe.
   - For a pipe open at both ends (open-open), the fundamental mode has antinodes at both ends, fitting half a wavelength.

2. **Mathematical Relationship**:
   - The length \( L_1 \) for the closed-end pipe is related to its wavelength by: 
     \[
     L_1 = \frac{\lambda_1}{4}
     \]
   - The length \( L_2 \) for the open-ended pipe is related to its wavelength by:
     \[
     L_2 = \frac{\lambda_2}{2}
     \]

3. **Equalizing Fundamental Frequencies**:
   - To have the same fundamental frequency, the velocity of sound (same in both pipes due to identical conditions) times their respective wavelengths must be equal.
   - This gives: 
     \[
     4L_1 = 2L_2
     \]
   - Simplifying leads to:
     \[
     L_2 = 2L_1
     \]

### Conclusion:

For two pipes in identical atmospheric conditions to have the same fundamental frequency, a pipe open at both ends must be twice as long as a pipe that is closed at one end. This understanding relies on visualizing and remembering the mode shapes of sound waves in these configurations: node-antinode for closed-open and antinode-antinode for open-open pipes.
