The text describes a process for simplifying an algebraic expression involving exponents and distribution over addition. Here's a summary:

1. **Expression Setup**: Start with \(5 \times A^{-3} \times (B + A^2)\).

2. **Distribution**:
   - Distribute \(5A^{-3}\) across the terms inside the parentheses, resulting in:
     \[
     5A^{-3} \cdot B + 5A^{-3} \cdot A^2
     \]

3. **Simplification**:
   - The first term simplifies to \(5B \cdot A^{-3}\).
   - Use exponent rules for the second term: \(5A^{-3} \cdot A^2 = 5A^{-1}\).

4. **Final Expression**: Combine the simplified terms:
   \[
   5B \cdot A^{-3} + 5A^{-1}
   \]

5. **Interpretation of Negative Exponents**:
   - Rewrite using negative exponents as fractions:
     - \(5B \cdot A^{-3} = \frac{5B}{A^3}\)
     - \(5A^{-1} = \frac{5}{A}\)

The fully expanded and simplified expression is:

\[
\frac{5B}{A^3} + \frac{5}{A}
\]

Additionally, the text discusses symbolic computation using Python's SymPy library to handle square roots, especially when dealing with non-negative and negative numbers. It provides examples of how to distribute square roots over products and explains why certain properties don't hold for negative numbers in real arithmetic, leading to imaginary results.

The text outlines how SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, can be used to simplify algebraic expressions such as polynomials and expand terms involving radicals or powers. Here's a summary:

1. **Symbol Definition**: Using `symbols` from SymPy allows the definition of variables (e.g., `x`, `a`, `b`) with specific properties like being real numbers by default.

2. **Expression Expansion**: The `.expand()` method in SymPy is used to:
   - Expand products of binomials and trinomials into polynomials.
   - Utilize the binomial theorem for expanding powers of sums, showing coefficients from Pascal's triangle.

3. **Handling Radicals**: Special attention is needed when distributing across radicals due to varying rules based on the sign of numbers involved. Testing with specific values helps ensure correctness in these cases.

4. **Benefits of SymPy**:
   - Automates and ensures accuracy in algebraic expansions.
   - Provides clear, textbook-like readable formats.
   - Facilitates quick verification by substituting numerical values to test symbolic manipulations.

Overall, SymPy enhances efficiency and reduces errors in algebraic manipulation compared to manual methods. Additionally, the text suggests using pie charts as a tool for verifying work with practical exercises, highlighting their ease of use in this context.
