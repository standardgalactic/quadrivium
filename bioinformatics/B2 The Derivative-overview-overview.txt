The text describes an experiment involving plotting two variables against each other to examine their relationship, initially observing a parabolic curve instead of a straight line. It explains that by drawing secant lines between two points on the curve, one can approximate the slope (change in y over change in x). However, these secant lines do not lie perfectly on the curve.

As you bring the two points closer together to be infinitesimally close, the secant line approaches a tangent line. This process is explained using calculus concepts: it describes finding the instantaneous rate of change or slope at a single point by letting the difference in x (delta x) approach zero. The text connects this with foundational first-year calculus concepts regarding how secant lines relate to tangent lines and instantaneous rates of change.

Additionally, there are references to deeper mathematical discussions that suggest further exploration through interactive methods such as group activities or presentations.
