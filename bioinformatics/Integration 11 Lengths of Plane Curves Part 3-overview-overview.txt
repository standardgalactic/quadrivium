To calculate the length of a curve defined by \( y = f(x) \) over an interval \([a, b]\), you can use parametric equations with these steps:

1. **Parametrize the Curve**: Set \( x = t \). Consequently, \( y = f(t) \).

2. **Calculate Derivatives**:
   - Since \( x = t \), the derivative is \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 1 \).
   - For \( y = f(t) \), the derivative is \( \frac{dy}{dt} = f'(t) \).

3. **Curve Length Formula**: The length \( L \) of the curve from \( a \) to \( b \) is given by:
   \[
   L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
   \]

4. **Substitute the Derivatives**:
   - \( \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \)
   - \( \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 = (f'(t))^2 \)

5. **Final Equation**:
   \[
   L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + (f'(t))^2} \, dt
   \]

This integral provides the length of a curve for any continuously differentiable function \( f(x) \) over the interval from \( a \) to \( b \).
