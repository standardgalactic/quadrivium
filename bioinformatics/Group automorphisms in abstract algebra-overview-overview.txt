The text provides an overview of group theory, focusing on automorphisms and isomorphisms within groups. Key points include:

1. **Group Automorphism**: Defined as an isomorphism from a group onto itself, preserving its structure through bijective homomorphism.
   
2. **Automorphism Properties**:
   - The identity mapping of a group qualifies as an automorphism.
   - Composition of two automorphisms results in another automorphism.
   - An automorphism's inverse remains an automorphism.

3. **Automorphism as a Group**: 
   - All automorphisms of a group form a subgroup under function composition, also known as the automorphism group, which is part of the symmetric group on that set.

4. **Bijective Nature**: Automorphisms are bijective, ensuring unique mapping for each element in both domain and codomain.

5. **Isomorphism Property**: For any elements \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \), an automorphism \( F \) satisfies \( F(G_1 \cdot G_2) = F(G_1) \cdot F(G_2) \).

The text concludes with a mention of providing examples in the future to illustrate these concepts.
