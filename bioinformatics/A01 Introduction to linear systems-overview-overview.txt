The text introduces an advanced series on differential equations, focusing on solving linear systems using matrix equations. It aims to show how a system of differential equations can be transformed and solved as a matrix problem. The example provided involves two differential equations:

1. \( y' + 7y - 4x = 0 \)
2. \( x' - 3x + 4y = 0 \)

Here, both \( x \) and \( y \) are functions of time \( t \). The solutions to these equations are given as:

- \( x(t) = e^{-5t} \)
- \( y(t) = 2e^{-5t} \)

These solutions reveal a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \), specifically \( y = 2x \).

The system is represented using matrices by defining a matrix \( X \) with components \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \). The derivative of this matrix, \( X' \), can be expressed as:

\[ X' = AX \]

where \( A \) is the coefficient matrix derived from the original equations:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -4 \\ 4 & -7 \end{bmatrix} \]

The product \( AX \) results in expressions for \( x' \) and \( y' \), consistent with the derivatives from the solutions.

The text distinguishes between homogeneous systems (where an additional function \( f(t) = 0 \)) and non-homogeneous systems (where \( f(t) \neq 0 \)). The goal is to solve for functions that satisfy these matrix equations, with future discussions exploring concepts of linear dependency.
