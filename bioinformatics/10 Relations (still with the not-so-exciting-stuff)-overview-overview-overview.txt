The text explores the mathematical concept of "relations," which are subsets of product sets. A relation on a set \(A\) is defined as a subset of the Cartesian product \(A \times A\), consisting of ordered pairs formed by elements from \(A\). An example given involves the set \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) and defines a "divides" relation where pairs consist of numbers that divide each other without remainder, such as (1,1) or (2,2).

Another instance uses the set \(A\) containing natural numbers from 1 to 20, defining a relation based on multiplication by 3. This results in ordered pairs like (1,3) or (2,6). The text emphasizes using product set notation for describing these relations and notes that the order of elements in the pairs can change depending on context.

The discussion extends to binary relations, which involve pairs from \(A\) onto itself, setting the stage for further exploration into their properties.
