The text discusses the rationale and history behind glucose control in the perioperative period, focusing on the administration of insulin to patients. Historically, post-operative increases in blood glucose were seen as normal. However, uncontrolled glucose levels in diabetic patients can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

Initial research advocated for very tight glucose control, aiming to maintain levels below 110 mg/dL (approximately 6.1 mmol/L), which showed a reduction in negative outcomes. However, subsequent randomized trials revealed that such stringent control could actually increase morbidity and mortality due to the risk of hypoglycemia.

The discrepancy arises because early studies were not randomized and relied on intensive care protocols with highly trained staff, minimizing risks like hypoglycemia. In contrast, normal clinical settings without these resources led to higher instances of hypoglycemia and adverse outcomes when attempting very tight glucose control.

Current practice recommends maintaining blood glucose below 180 mg/dL (approximately 10 mmol/L) during the perioperative period, as this balance improves patient outcomes compared to either no intervention or excessively tight control.

The text discusses the evolution and current understanding of glucose control in the perioperative period, focusing on why and how insulin is administered to patients. Initially, increased post-operative glucose levels were considered a normal response, but uncontrolled glucose, especially in diabetic patients, could lead to morbidity or mortality.

Early research advocated for very tight glucose control (below 110 mg/dL), showing reduced morbidity and mortality when managed by well-trained nursing staff under optimal conditions. However, subsequent randomized trials indicated that such stringent control might increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which in turn could elevate morbidity and mortality rates.

The discrepancy arises because initial studies were not randomized and involved high levels of patient care, while later trials reflected more typical clinical settings where tighter control led to frequent hypoglycemic episodes. Current practice aims for a balanced approach: maintaining glucose below 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) to improve outcomes without the risks associated with overly strict control.
