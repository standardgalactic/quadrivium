The text discusses the rationale and history behind glucose control in the perioperative period, focusing on the administration of insulin to patients. Historically, post-operative increases in blood glucose were seen as normal. However, uncontrolled glucose levels in diabetic patients can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

Initial research advocated for very tight glucose control, aiming to maintain levels below 110 mg/dL (approximately 6.1 mmol/L), which showed a reduction in negative outcomes. However, subsequent randomized trials revealed that such stringent control could actually increase morbidity and mortality due to the risk of hypoglycemia.

The discrepancy arises because early studies were not randomized and relied on intensive care protocols with highly trained staff, minimizing risks like hypoglycemia. In contrast, normal clinical settings without these resources led to higher instances of hypoglycemia and adverse outcomes when attempting very tight glucose control.

Current practice recommends maintaining blood glucose below 180 mg/dL (approximately 10 mmol/L) during the perioperative period, as this balance improves patient outcomes compared to either no intervention or excessively tight control.
