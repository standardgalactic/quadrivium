The text discusses problems related to wave interference, specifically in scenarios involving radio waves and light waves.

1. **Radio Waves from Two Antennas:**
   - An antenna at a house receives signals from another antenna 7 km away on any point of that radius. A second antenna is placed 8.12 km away.
   - The difference in distance (delta L) between the two antennas to the house is 1.12 km (1120 meters).
   - Constructive interference occurs when this path difference equals an integer multiple of the wavelength, while destructive interference occurs at half-integer multiples.
   - Using the speed of light \( C = 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s and frequency \( F = 536,000 \) Hz, the wavelength (\( \lambda \)) is calculated as approximately 560 meters.
   - Since 1120 meters fits exactly two wavelengths (2 * 560), constructive interference occurs.

2. **Double Slit Experiment with Light:**
   - The experiment uses red light (~665 nm) and yellow-green light (~565 nm) to create an interference pattern on a screen 2.24 m away.
   - The task is to find the distance between the third-order bright fringes of these two colors.
   - Using the formula for fringe position \( Y = L \times \tan(\theta) \), where \( \theta = \arcsin(M \lambda / D) \), and \( M = 3 \) (third order), the difference in positions (\( \Delta Y \)) is calculated to be about 4.25 mm.

3. **Young's Double Slit Experiment with a Plastic Sheet:**
   - Monochromatic light passes through two slits, one covered by a plastic sheet with refractive index \( n_1 = 1.60 \).
   - To achieve destructive interference at the central axis (dark fringe), the path difference must be half a wavelength.
   - Using the formula \( (n_2 - n_1) \cdot L = m \lambda / 2 \) for minimum thickness, where \( n_2 = 1.60 \) and \( n_1 = 1.00 \), the minimum thickness \( L \) is calculated as \( \lambda / 1.2 \).
   - The result is approximately 488 nm for the thinnest plastic sheet to achieve total destructive interference.

These problems illustrate principles of wave interference, path differences, and how they affect constructive and destructive interference patterns in both radio and light waves.
