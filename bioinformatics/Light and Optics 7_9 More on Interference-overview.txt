The text discusses problems related to wave interference, specifically in scenarios involving radio waves and light waves.

1. **Radio Waves from Two Antennas:**
   - An antenna at a house receives signals from another antenna 7 km away on any point of that radius. A second antenna is placed 8.12 km away.
   - The difference in distance (delta L) between the two antennas to the house is 1.12 km (1120 meters).
   - Constructive interference occurs when this path difference equals an integer multiple of the wavelength, while destructive interference occurs at half-integer multiples.
   - Using the speed of light \( C = 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s and frequency \( F = 536,000 \) Hz, the wavelength (\( \lambda \)) is calculated as approximately 560 meters.
   - Since 1120 meters fits exactly two wavelengths (2 * 560), constructive interference occurs.

2. **Double Slit Experiment with Light:**
   - The experiment uses red light (~665 nm) and yellow-green light (~565 nm) to create an interference pattern on a screen 2.24 m away.
   - The task is to find the distance between the third-order bright fringes of these two colors.
   - Using the formula for fringe position \( Y = L \times \tan(\theta) \), where \( \theta = \arcsin(M \lambda / D) \), and \( M = 3 \) (third order), the difference in positions (\( \Delta Y \)) is calculated to be about 4.25 mm.

3. **Young's Double Slit Experiment with a Plastic Sheet:**
   - Monochromatic light passes through two slits, one covered by a plastic sheet with refractive index \( n_1 = 1.60 \).
   - To achieve destructive interference at the central axis (dark fringe), the path difference must be half a wavelength.
   - Using the formula \( (n_2 - n_1) \cdot L = m \lambda / 2 \) for minimum thickness, where \( n_2 = 1.60 \) and \( n_1 = 1.00 \), the minimum thickness \( L \) is calculated as \( \lambda / 1.2 \).
   - The result is approximately 488 nm for the thinnest plastic sheet to achieve total destructive interference.

These problems illustrate principles of wave interference, path differences, and how they affect constructive and destructive interference patterns in both radio and light waves.

The text outlines several physics problems involving wave interference, particularly focusing on constructive and destructive interference with antennas, light wavelengths, and thin films.

1. **Antenna Problem**: Two antennas are broadcasting waves towards a receiver at different distances (7 km and 8.12 km). The difference in path lengths is 1.12 km. Constructive interference occurs when the path length difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, while destructive interference happens with half-integer multiples. Using \(C = f \lambda\), where \(f\) is 536,000 Hz and \(c\) (speed of light) is approximately \(3.00 \times 10^8\) m/s, the calculated wavelength (\(\lambda\)) is about 560 meters. Since two wavelengths fit into a path difference of 1.12 km, constructive interference occurs.

2. **Double Slit Experiment**: This experiment uses red (665 nm) and yellow-green (565 nm) lights with slits separated by some distance. The problem involves finding the distance between the third-order bright fringes for these two colors on a screen 2.24 meters away. Using the formula \(Y = L \tan(\sin^{-1}(m\lambda/D))\), where \(L\) is the distance to the screen, \(m\) is the fringe order (3 in this case), and \(D\) is the slit separation, the distance between the third-order fringes for red and yellow-green light is calculated to be approximately 4.25 mm.

3. **Thin Film Interference**: A thin plastic sheet with a refractive index of 1.60 is placed over one slit in a double-slit experiment using monochromatic light. The goal is to find the minimum thickness of the plastic that results in destructive interference on the central axis (dark fringe). This occurs when the optical path difference equals half the wavelength: \((n_2 - n_1) \cdot L = \frac{\lambda}{2}\), where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the refractive indices of vacuum and plastic, respectively. Solving this gives a minimum thickness of about 488 nm for destructive interference.

These problems illustrate key concepts in wave interference, including path differences, wavelength calculations, and phase shifts due to changes in medium.
