The text provides an explanation of nuclear binding energy and the concept of mass defect. Here’s a summary:

1. **Nuclear Binding Energy**: This is the energy required to hold nucleons (protons and neutrons) together within a nucleus. The discussion begins with helium, comprising two protons and two neutrons.

2. **Mass Defect**: When individual nucleons are bound into a nucleus, their combined mass decreases compared to when they are separate. For instance, the total mass of four individual nucleons (two protons and two neutrons) is greater than the mass of the helium nucleus by 5.03 x 10^-29 kg. This difference in mass is termed the mass defect.

3. **Energy Conversion**: The concept from special relativity that energy (E) equals mass (m) times the speed of light squared (c²) explains this phenomenon. The mass lost during binding transforms into energy, known as nuclear binding energy. For helium-4, this binding energy is approximately 28.3 MeV.

4. **Atomic Mass Units (amu)**: Instead of kilograms, atomic mass units are often used in chemistry and physics for convenience. One atomic mass unit is defined based on one-twelfth the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

5. **Conversions**: A proton's mass translates to 1.0073 amu, and when this is multiplied by c², it equals approximately 931.5 MeV. This conversion allows for consistent calculations across different nuclei.

6. **Atomic Mass Tables**: These often list atomic masses including electrons, which have a negligible weight but are included for accuracy in mass tables. For example, helium-4 with its electrons has an atomic mass of about 4.0026 amu.

7. **Mass and Binding Energy Relationships**: When calculating nuclear reactions or binding energies using atomic mass units, it’s essential to consider these conversions and include the small mass contribution from electrons for elements like hydrogen and helium.

Overall, this section illustrates how mass defect leads to nuclear binding energy through the principles of special relativity, highlighting practical considerations in using atomic mass units.

The text discusses how to calculate binding energy using atomic mass units (AMUs) instead of kilograms, particularly in contexts where data is given like in periodic tables. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Atomic Number and Mass**: The entity discussed has an atomic number of 0 and an atomic mass number of 1, with a specified atomic mass of approximately 1.0087 AMUs.

2. **Calculation Approach**: When calculating binding energy using data from periodic tables (e.g., element names), the calculation involves adjustments due to inclusion of electrons in the units, unlike direct calculations using kilograms and nucleons alone.

3. **Energy Conversion**: The process involves determining the binding energy by subtracting the atomic mass unit values and converting these into mega electron volts (MeV) using a conversion factor of 931.5 MeV per AMU.

4. **Example Calculation**: An example is given where a calculated binding energy of approximately 28.32 MeV was derived, confirming that results are consistent whether using kilograms or atomic mass units for the calculation.

5. **Stability Analysis**: The text then poses a problem to determine the most and least stable nuclei based on their mass defects, with stability inferred from the amount of energy needed to form them (larger positive mass defect implies greater stability).

Overall, the passage underscores the methodological differences in calculating binding energies using atomic mass units versus direct mass measurements and emphasizes understanding these nuances for accurate physics calculations.

The text discusses nuclear stability in terms of binding energy and mass defect, drawing from Einstein's equation \(E = mc^2\). Here’s a summary:

1. **Binding Energy**: The amount of energy needed to break apart a nucleus into its individual protons and neutrons is called the binding energy. A higher binding energy indicates greater nuclear stability.

2. **Mass Defect (\(\Delta m\))**: This refers to the difference between the mass of an assembled nucleus and the sum of its individual nucleons' masses. According to \(E = \Delta mc^2\), a larger mass defect corresponds to a higher binding energy, thus more stability.

3. **Stability Comparison**: The text explains that among hypothetical nuclei:
   - Nucleus A is most stable due to high binding energy.
   - Nucleus D is least stable as it requires no energy to disintegrate.

4. **Binding Energy per Nucleon Graph**: Many textbooks illustrate nuclear stability by plotting the number of nucleons (atomic mass number) against the binding energy per nucleon. Typically, nuclei with around 60 nucleons have the highest stability and binding energy per nucleon.

5. **Example with Helium Isotopes**:
   - Helium-3 (\(^3_2\text{He}\)) has an atomic mass of 3.016030 u.
   - Tritium (\(^3_1\text{H}\)), a hydrogen isotope, has a slightly higher atomic mass of 3.016050 u.

6. **Calculating Binding Energy**:
   - To determine the binding energy in atomic mass units (u), compare the mass defect when helium-3 breaks into its components: two protons and one neutron versus tritium's composition (one proton, two neutrons).
   - This comparison allows calculation of the energy released or required for nuclear reactions.

The text emphasizes understanding nuclear stability through binding energies and mass defects, using isotopes like helium as examples.

The text explains how to calculate the binding energy of hydrogen and tritium nuclei using significant digits. For hydrogen, you add its atomic mass (1.007825) to a neutron's mass (1.008665), then subtract the helium nucleus mass (3.016030). This calculation yields 8.285 x 10^-3 units for hydrogen. For tritium, you combine one hydrogen atom with two neutrons and subtract helium-3's mass (3.016050) to get 9.105 x 10^-3 units.

The results show that more energy is needed to separate the nucleons in a tritium nucleus compared to a helium-3 nucleus when multiplied by M squared, which is about 9.9315 MeV per unit. This indicates that tritium has a higher binding energy than helium-3.
