Postpartum thyroiditis occurs in the first year after delivery.
It is defined by an abnormal TSH level either elevated or depressed, in the absence of TSH
receptor antibodies or toxic nodule.
A quarter of women present with a classical picture of transient hyperthyroidism occurring
6 weeks to 6 months after delivery and a hypothyroid state that lasts for up to a year postpartum.
Almost all hyperthyroid phases are transient and the use of antithyroid drugs is almost
never advocated.
Some patients suffer from adrenergic symptoms and beta blockers may be used.
Hypothyroidism can be more permanent and thyroxine treatment may be required.
Long term follow up with these patients is then essential.
It is important to always consider this diagnosis during postpartum visits as many symptoms,
especially depression, will be considered a normal postpartum event as opposed to being
caused by thyroiditis.
And evaluating TSH and T4 levels with thyroid peroxidase antibodies must be considered.
As a last word I must mention Graves thyroiditis.
As many as 60% of women who develop Graves disease in their reproductive years will do so
in the postpartum period.
Graves disease is a clinical diagnosis supported by the finding of suppressed TSH levels and elevated
thyroid hormone levels as well as suggestive scintigraphy.
The majority will have TSH receptor antibodies.
