The text explores statistical concepts by first discussing theoretical ideas of central tendency and dispersion before applying them practically. Central tendency reduces a dataset into a single representative value like the mean or median, offering insight into where data is centered. Dispersion measures how spread out the data is, using tools such as range, variance, and standard deviation. The text recommends calculating these step-by-step with practical examples to deepen understanding of these statistical concepts.
