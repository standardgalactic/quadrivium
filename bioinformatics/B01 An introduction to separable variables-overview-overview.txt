The text outlines a method for solving differential equations with separable variables. In such cases, the derivative \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) can be expressed as a product of two functions: one depending only on \(x\) and the other only on \(y\). The technique involves rearranging terms to isolate expressions involving \(y\) on one side and those involving \(x\) on the other. This is done by dividing both sides by the function of \(y\), multiplying by \(dx\), and then integrating each side separately with respect to their respective variables. This results in two integrals: one with respect to \(y\) and the other with respect to \(x\). Solving these integrals yields a solution for \(y\) as a function of \(x\). The text recommends examining examples to better understand this method.
