The text discusses the concept of node degrees in graph theory. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge, and each vertex has an equal number of edges incident to it. This results in all nodes having the same degree, which classifies such graphs as regular graphs.

For any given vertex, its degree is determined by counting the edges incident upon it. In cases where loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) exist, each loop contributes two to the vertex's degree rather than one.

The text then introduces Mathematica as a tool for examining graph properties. It demonstrates how to create a complete graph with 10 nodes and calculate their degrees using the software, revealing that all vertices in this complete graph have a degree of 9. Summing these degrees yields a total of 90, which aligns with the handshaking lemmaâ€”stating that the sum of all vertex degrees in a graph is twice the number of edges.

In summary, the text explains node degrees, introduces regular graphs and loops, and illustrates how to use Mathematica for computing these properties. The relationship between vertex degree totals and edge counts (handshaking lemma) is emphasized as an important aspect of understanding graph structures.

The text discusses the "hand-shaking lemma," which states that in any undirected graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges. This concept is illustrated through examples of regular graphs, where each vertex has the same degree.

1. **Introduction to Regular Graphs**: A regular graph is one where every node (vertex) has the same degree, meaning they are connected to the same number of other nodes.

2. **Example 1 - Degree One Regular Graph**:
   - Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Edges: Connect each node in a way that results in all having a degree of one.
   - This is described as an "absolutely regular graph."

3. **Example 2 - Degree Two Regular Graph Using Loops**:
   - Nodes are connected with loops (an edge from a vertex to itself), which counts as two towards the degree.
   - Example connections: 
     - Node 1 has a loop (degree of 2).
     - Nodes 2, and 3 have edges connecting them in pairs (each having a degree of 2).

These examples demonstrate how regular graphs maintain uniformity in vertex degrees, showcasing the hand-shaking lemma's application.
