To include all data points in your Plotly box plot, you need to modify the `boxpoints` argument. Here’s how you can adjust your code:

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Assuming df is your DataFrame with 'Income' column
p1 = px.box(df, y='Income', title="All Income",
            labels={"Income": "All Income"},
            boxpoints='all')  # This will include all data points

# Update the layout if needed
p1.update_layout(
    xaxis_title='Income',
    yaxis_title='Count'
)

# Show the plot
p1.show()
```

### Key Points:
- **`boxpoints='all'`:** This argument ensures that all individual data points are shown in addition to the box and whiskers.
- **Horizontal Plot:** If you want a horizontal plot, switch `y='Income'` to `x='Income'`.
- **Layout Updates:** Use `update_layout()` to adjust axis titles or other layout features.

This will display each data point along with the traditional box plot components. Keep in mind that plotting 500 points might make it visually cluttered, but it’s useful for detailed analysis.

The text describes how to create enhanced box plots using Plotly, a visualization library. Here’s a summary of key points:

1. **Jitter Addition**: To avoid overlapping data points, jitter is added with a value of 0.3, and `point pos` (position) at -2 shifts the plot slightly to the side.

2. **Mean and Standard Deviation**: By using the `box mean` argument set to "sd", both the mean and standard deviation are plotted alongside quartiles. The mean is indicated by a dotted line.

3. **Multiple Box Plots with Categorical Variables**: Using Plotly, box plots can be created for multiple categories. For instance:
   - Split numerical data (like income) using categorical variables such as "stage" (early, mid, late).
   - Further split the plot by another category like "country" to create a more detailed visualization.

4. **Layout Customization**: The layout can be adjusted to group plots based on categories using `box mode`. While Plotly doesn't recognize `box mode` as a keyword argument officially, it is used with caution by disabling warnings and messages for successful execution.

5. **Interactive Features**: Plotly allows interactive toggling of plot elements, such as hiding specific categories (e.g., "mid" stage).

6. **Outlier Marker Customization**: Outlier markers can be customized in shape and color using the `marker` argument, with options like square dots for better visibility against box rectangles.

7. **Color Schemes**: The plot's appearance can be further enhanced by choosing different color sets from Plotly’s predefined options (e.g., set three).

Overall, Plotly provides a versatile platform for creating informative and visually appealing box plots that can display numerical data distributions across various categorical variables while allowing extensive customization of visual elements.
