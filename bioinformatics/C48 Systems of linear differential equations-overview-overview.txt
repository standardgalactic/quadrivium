The text addresses solving a homogeneous system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with dependent variables \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\), both functions of an independent variable \(t\). The system consists of:

1. \(\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y = 0\)
2. \(\frac{dy}{dt} - 3x - 2y = 0\)

The solution process involves eliminating one variable to obtain a single ODE for the other variable. By expressing \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) from the first equation and substituting it into the second, you reduce the system to an ODE in \(y(t)\). This is solved using the auxiliary equation method, yielding solutions involving exponential functions:

- The general solution for \(y(t)\) is given by: 
  \[
  y(t) = c_1 e^{-3t} + c_2 e^{2t}
  \]

A similar process is applied to find the solution for \(x(t)\):

- The general form of \(x(t)\) is:
  \[
  x(t) = c_3 e^{-3t} + c_4 e^{2t}
  \]

Since this is a linear system, there are dependencies between the constants. By substituting back into the original equations and ensuring consistency for all \(t\), you can express \(c_3\) and \(c_4\) in terms of \(c_1\) and \(c_2\). The final solutions for \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) depend on two arbitrary constants, reflecting the system's degree of freedom. These constants are determined by initial conditions or additional constraints.
