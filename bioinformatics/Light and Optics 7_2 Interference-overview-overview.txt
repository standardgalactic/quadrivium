The text explores how light's properties—frequency, wavelength, and velocity—are affected by different mediums through their refractive index. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Frequency Constancy**: Light’s frequency remains unchanged when it transitions between different media.
   
2. **Wavelength Changes with Refractive Index**:
   - The wavelength in a medium (\(\lambda_n\)) is related to its vacuum wavelength (\(\lambda\)) by \(\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda}{n}\), where \(n\) is the refractive index. Thus, light's wavelength decreases as it enters a medium with higher refractive index.

3. **Velocity Relationship**:
   - The speed of light in a medium (\(v\)) is connected to its vacuum speed (\(c\)) through the refractive index: \(n = \frac{c}{v}\). A higher refractive index results in reduced speed for light within that medium.

4. **Wavelength and Velocity**:
   - Since frequency remains constant, any change in velocity affects wavelength proportionally, maintaining the relationship \(v = f\lambda\).

5. **Snell's Law Context**:
   - Refraction at an interface between two media with different refractive indices (\(n_1\) and \(n_2\)) causes the incident angle to be larger than the refracted angle if \(n_1 < n_2\). Higher refractive index leads to shorter wavelengths and slower speed.

6. **Phase Differences**:
   - Light traveling through mediums with different refractive indices can experience phase differences, impacting interference patterns based on whether waves are in-phase or out-of-phase upon exiting.

Additionally, the text provides methods for calculating how many wavelengths fit within a length \(L\), and determining phase differences when light travels through media with varying refractive indices:

1. **Wavelengths in Length \( L \)**: 
   - If one wavelength equals one-third of \(L\), then three wavelengths fit per unit length \(L\).

2. **Calculating Number of Wavelengths**:
   - Divide the length \(L\) by the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) to find the number of wavelengths fitting within that length, which is 3.

3. **Wavelength in Different Media**:
   - In a medium with refractive index \(N\), the wavelength becomes \(\lambda/N\). For two indices \(N_1\) and \(N_2\), the wavelengths are \(\lambda/N_1\) and \(\lambda/N_2\).

4. **Phase Difference Calculation**:
   - The phase difference in radians is derived from the number of waves per length \(L\): \((N_2 - N_1) \times (L/\lambda)\), with a full wavelength corresponding to \(2\pi\) radians.

5. **Example Illustration**:
   - For light traveling through air (\(N_1 = 1\)) and plastic (\(N_2 = 1.600\)), with vacuum wavelength \(550\) nm, in plastic of width \(2.6\) µm, the phase difference is about \(2.836\) wavelengths.

The fractional part of a calculated number of wavelengths (e.g., .836) is crucial for determining phase differences, as only this fraction affects calculations like those involving phase shifts between sinusoidal waves with identical frequency and amplitude. In this example, a phase difference of approximately 300 degrees results from the fractional part (\(0.836\)) of the wavelength count.
