The text defines and explores the concept of an "identity element" within a set that uses a binary operation. An identity element \( u \) in a set \( x \) has a special property: for any element \( x_1 \) in the set, applying the binary operation to \( u \) and \( x_1 \), or vice versa (\( u \cdot x_1 = x_1 \cdot u = x_1 \)), returns the original element \( x_1 \). The text emphasizes that if an identity element exists within a set under a commutative binary operation, it is unique.

Examples provided include:
- In the set of integers with addition as the binary operation, 0 is the identity element because adding 0 to any integer yields the same integer.
- In the set of integers with multiplication, 1 is the identity element because multiplying any integer by 1 results in that integer.

To prove the uniqueness of the identity element, a proof by contradiction is suggested. The argument assumes two identity elements \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \). According to their properties:
- Using \( p_1 \) as an identity, applying the binary operation with \( p_2 \) must yield \( p_2 \).
- Using \( p_2 \) as an identity, applying the binary operation with \( p_1 \) must yield \( p_1 \).

This leads to \( p_1 = p_2 \), contradicting the assumption of non-uniqueness. Therefore, if an identity element exists within a set under these conditions, it must be unique.

The concluding part of the text seems to contain unrelated or unclear statements that do not directly connect with the mathematical discussion of identity elements.
