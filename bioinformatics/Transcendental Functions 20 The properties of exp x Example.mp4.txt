We can have a quick look at an example
just using the properties that we just looked at
and we have the properties of e to the power of x plus n to the power of 2
and we can have the properties of 1
which means we have e to the power of x
times e to the power of n to the power of 2
which means e to the power of x times 2
which means 2 e to the power of x
Now, if we look at these properties of 1
we obviously don't have any properties of 1
for the n to the power of n to the power of x
Let's have an instance
e to the power of x 1
times e to the power of x 2
and we know that's going to be x to the power x
or 1 plus x 2
The same is when we have the variable
as the
not only exponent
but if you think back of x to the power of a times x to the power of b
what we do now is we put the variable in the exponent
but that we can do like this
a to the power x1 can be written as e to the power x1 natural log of a
and that can be written as e to the power xn to the power of a
and that can be written as e to the power x2 natural log of a
In the previous video, we can say that it will be e to the power x1 natural log of a plus x2 natural log of a.
We can actually take natural log of a out, so we have x1 plus x2 natural log of a.
And that is going to be the same as saying a to the power x1 plus x2.
So that equals the same sign.
