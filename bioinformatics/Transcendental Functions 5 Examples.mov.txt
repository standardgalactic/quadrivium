Let's get some more examples under our belt. Let's look at the log base 2 of x plus 2 plus
the log of 2 of x log base 2 of x and that equals 3. Let's see if we can solve for that. First of all our bases are the same so we can use our property of multiplication and write the log base 2 of x plus 2 times x and we can also create a
log on the other side with a base 2. If we multiply 3 by 1 and we know we can rewrite 1 as log 2 of 2. In other words this will be 3 log 2 of 2.
Log base 2. I can multiply that out. That becomes x squared plus 2x and yeah I can use the property of power and write log 2 base 2 of 2 and take that 3 and make it the power.
And now I have log 2 on both sides and I can simply say that x squared plus 2x equals 8 and I can solve for this easy polynomial.
x squared plus 2x minus 8 equals 0. In other words x plus 4 times x minus 2 equals 0 and x equals negative 4 or x equals 2 but remember the domain of logarithms are greater than 1.
In other words our answer is x equals 2. Let's look at another example. Let's say solve this equation. 25 to the power 2x plus 1 equals 15.
Now we have to solve for x. Now we have to solve for x. Remembering that if you look at your calculator it will only do log base 10 and log base Euler's number or the natural log.
So if I rewrote this in logarithmic form. So if I rewrote this in logarithmic form I would just say the log base 25 log base 25 of 15 equals 2x plus 1.
But your calculator won't do log base 25 of 15. So how do you solve an equation for an unknown if the unknown is locked up in a power?
Well you simply take the log of both sides. In other words I can rewrite that as the log.
Now this will be log base 10 and my calculator can do that. Log base 10 25 to the power 2x plus 1 equals log base 10 of 15.
Log base 10 of 15. Now I can use a property of the power of logarithms and I can bring that 2x plus 1 which is the power of 25 down in front of the log.
So that will be 2x plus 1 times the log base 10 of 25 equals log base 10 of 15.
Now I can divide both sides by log base 10 of 25 and that's going to give me, I'm going to drop the base 10 because if we don't write the base 10 it is taken for granted that the base is 10 and our calculator can actually do that.
So that will be the log base 10 of 15. So that will be the log of 15 divided by the log of 25 minus 1 and x equals the log of 15 divided by the log of 25 minus 1.
And x equals the log of 15 divided by the log of 25 minus 1 all divided by 2.
And your calculator can do log of 15 divided by log of 25. So on the right hand side a simple arithmetic with a calculator of course and you get an answer for x.
So this is a very good example of showing how to solve for x if x is in the exponent or x is locked up in the power.
