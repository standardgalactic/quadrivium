The text explains concepts related to the speed of light in different media and critical angles for total internal reflection. Here's a summary:

1. **Speed of Light in Diamond**: The speed is approximately \(1.24 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), calculated using diamond's refractive index of 2.42.

2. **Critical Angle (Diamond to Air)**: Calculated as approximately \(24.4^\circ\) using Snell's Law, where light transitions from diamond (n = 2.42) to air (n = 1).

3. **Critical Angle (Glass to Water)**: Approximately \(59.7^\circ\), calculated for the transition of light from glass (n = 1.54) to water (n = 1.33).

4. **Light Transitioning from Water to Glass**: In this scenario, no critical angle exists because total internal reflection cannot occur when moving from a medium with a lower refractive index (water) to one with a higher refractive index (glass). Thus, light will always pass into the glass regardless of the incident angle.

These points highlight how different media affect the behavior of light, particularly in terms of speed and refraction.
