The video presenter explains solving a second-order linear differential equation with variable coefficients and a non-homogeneous term using two methods. Here's a summary:

1. **Formulation**: The problem involves non-constant, variable coefficients and is non-homogeneous.

2. **Solution Strategy**:
   - **Complementary Solution (Homogeneous Equation)**: The presenter guesses solutions of the form \( y = x^m \) for the homogeneous part, leading to a characteristic equation \((m-1)^2 = 0\) with repeated roots \( m_1 = m_2 = 1\). The complementary solution is:
     \[
     y_c = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x)
     \]
   - **Wronskian Calculation**: The Wronskian of \(y_1 = x\) and \(y_2 = x \ln(x)\) is found to be \(x\).

3. **Particular Solution (Non-Homogeneous Equation)**:
   - Convert the equation to standard form by dividing through by \(x^2\).
   - Use variation of parameters to find \(u_1\) and \(u_2\):
     \[
     u_1 = -\ln(x)^2, \quad u_2 = 2\ln(x)
     \]
   - Construct the particular solution:
     \[
     y_p = x \ln(x)^2
     \]

4. **General Solution**: Combine the complementary and particular solutions:
   \[
   y = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) + x \ln(x)^2
   \]

The presenter plans to use a substitution method (\( t = \ln(x) \)) in another video for verification or alternative derivation.
