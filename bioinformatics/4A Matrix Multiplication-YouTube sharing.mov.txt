Let us now consider matrix multiplication.
This is a bit different from multiplying a scalar value with a matrix,
where the scalar number is simply multiplied with each of the elements in the matrix.
There is a rule that governs matrix multiplication.
It states that matrices can only be multiplied if the number of columns in the first matrix
is the same as the number of rows in the second matrix.
If they are not, the multiplication is not defined.
That's it. If this rule is satisfied, we need only follow a simple recipe and the multiplication is done.
Here we have two matrices, A and B.
A is a 2x2 matrix, so it has two columns.
And B is a 2x4 matrix with two rows.
2 equals 2, so they can be multiplied.
Now for the simple recipe.
We are asked to get A times B.
A is first, so I'll call it the first matrix.
And B is second, so I'll call it matrix 2.
First determine the size of the resultant matrix.
To do this we simply throw away the two twos we just used to determine if the multiplication is defined.
We are left with a 2 for the rows from the first matrix and a 4 for the columns from the second matrix.
So our resultant matrix will be of size 2x4.
Now to get the element in row 1 column 1.
We take the elements in row 1 from matrix 1 and the elements from column 1 in matrix 2 and we write them like this.
The 2 and the 3 and the 1 and the 4.
Now we multiply each element.
2 times 1 is 2 and 3 times 4 is 12.
2 plus 12 is 14.
So the value of the first element is 14.
Quite simple.
Let's look at the next element.
That will be row 1 column 2 for the resultant matrix.
Again take the elements from the first row of the first matrix.
That is 2 and 3 and multiply each of these with the two elements of the second column of matrix 2.
That is the 2 and the 3.
2 times 2 is 4 and 3 times 3 is 9.
4 plus 9 is 13.
There we go.
13.
Pause the video and see if you get the same answers for the next two elements in row 1.
For the first element in row 2 of our resultant matrix.
We will take the two elements in row 2 of the first matrix.
That is the 4 and the 3.
And multiply each with the two elements in the first column of matrix 2.
That is the 1 and the 4.
4 times 1 is 4 and 3 times 4 is 12.
4 plus 12 is 16.
Pause the video again and see if you can do the rest.
