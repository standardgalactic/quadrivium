The text provides an explanation of how energy is transported by a transverse wave along a medium, specifically using a rope as an example. Here’s a summary:

1. **Wave Motion and Energy Transfer**: A transverse wave on a tight rope involves movement that transfers energy through the medium in two forms: kinetic energy (due to motion) and potential energy (due to stretching).

2. **Energy at Different Points**: The kinetic energy is maximum where the velocity of particles in the rope is greatest, while potential energy is maximized when the rope stretches.

3. **Kinetic Energy Calculation**: For a small segment of the rope, the differential kinetic energy can be expressed using the formula \( \frac{1}{2} dm v^2 \), with \( dm = \mu dx \) (where \( \mu \) is linear density and \( dx \) is a small length). The transverse velocity (\( v \)) is related to the wave's angular frequency (\(\omega\)) and amplitude (\(y_{max}\)).

4. **Potential Energy Consideration**: Potential energy is associated with the stretching of the rope, analogous to a spring’s potential energy.

5. **Power Calculation**: By analyzing the kinetic energy over time, the average power (energy transfer rate) is derived as \( \frac{1}{2} \mu v \omega^2 y_{max}^2 \). This considers the wave's velocity and other properties.

6. **Additive Energy Forms**: Both kinetic and potential energies contribute to the total energy transferred by the wave, with their contributions being additive.

7. **Final Equation for Average Power**: The average power transmitted by the wave is given as \( \frac{1}{2} \mu v \omega^2 y_{max}^2 \). This equation encapsulates how energy is transported along the medium by the wave.

The text emphasizes understanding this derivation to grasp how transverse waves transfer energy, even if memorizing the full derivation isn't necessary. The example problem at the end suggests applying this knowledge to a specific scenario involving a 2.7-meter rope.

The text describes a problem involving a wave on a stretched string. The string has a mass of 0.260 kg and is stretched between two points that are 2.7 meters apart, under a tension of 36 newtons. The goal is to determine the frequency of a traveling wave on this string when its amplitude is 7.7 mm and it transfers energy at an average rate of 85 watts.

To find the frequency, the text uses the formula for average power in terms of wave properties: \( P_{\text{average}} = \frac{1}{2} \mu v \omega^2 y_{\text{max}}^2 \), where:
- \(\mu\) is the linear mass density (\(m/L\)),
- \(v\) is the wave velocity,
- \(\omega\) is the angular frequency, and
- \(y_{\text{max}}\) is the amplitude.

The linear mass density \(\mu = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{length}} = \frac{0.260}{2.7} \, \text{kg/m}\).

Wave velocity \(v\) can be calculated using the formula: \( v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \), where \(T\) is the tension (36 N).

Angular frequency \(\omega\) relates to frequency \(f\) by \(\omega = 2\pi f\).

Using these relationships and rearranging for frequency, you can solve:

\[ f^2 = \frac{2P_{\text{average}}}{\mu v (2\pi)^2 y_{\text{max}}^2} \]

Solving this equation with the given values yields a frequency of approximately 198 Hz. The text suggests that such problems, involving wave mechanics and energy transfer, are relatively straightforward once the proper equations and relationships are applied.
