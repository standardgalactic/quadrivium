Now let's have a look at this very interesting homogeneous equation problem.
We have this differential equation here, which looks like it might be an exact form.
Let's have a look though. For this to be an exact form, we know that this we have to call the m of x and y.
Remember, in this we have to call the n of x and y. And we said that di m di x should equal di n, oops, di x.
Where is my, it is, di y should be that. So what is di m di y?
The partial derivative of y with respect to, with m with respect to y.
This is going to equal to 2y and di n di x. Well, that's going to be 2x minus y.
And these two are not the same.
The next step would be to see if we can make this into a, if we can make this into a, an exact equation.
And for that we have to remember the fact that we have these integrating factors and we call those the mu of x.
Remember that had to be e to the power of the indefinite integral of m y minus n x divided by n dx.
That was di m di y minus di n di x over n should be a function only of x.
And the other integrating factor was this.
n sub x minus m sub y divided by m dy.
And that should give you just a function of y.
Now you can do that. You can say 2y minus 2x plus y.
That's going to give you y minus 2x divided by n which is that.
That's not just going to be a function just in x.
And this is not going to be a function just in y.
So first of all it wasn't exact.
I can't get an integrating factor that will make it direct.
So I better go on to substitution.
And there were two substitutions when it came to these homogeneous equations.
And that was y equals the u of x.
And x equals the x equals vy.
Y equals u times x.
X equals v times y.
But before we can do that we have to remember that we have to have a look to make sure that this is a homogeneous equation.
And remember for that to be so m of t and x, ty should equal t alpha of m of x and y.
And n of t times x and t times y should equal t alpha.
Those two alpha should be exactly the same x and y.
If this is satisfied then this would be.
So let's have a look.
What is the m of tx and ty?
Well that is going to be t squared x squared plus t squared y squared.
Which equals just t squared.
If I take that out as a common factor.
And x squared plus y squared is just m of x and y.
So certainly we've got there.
And the n of tx and ty.
So every time I see an x I have to replace with tx.
And every place I see a y I have to replace with ty.
So that's going to leave me there with t squared x squared.
Plus txty.
And that is this also a t squared that I can take out.
And I'm left with x squared plus xy.
And that is t squared of n of x and y.
So that's 2 and that's 2.
So this is a homogeneous equation.
Now what's left to do.
If I can find.
I'd like to do this.
I think it's quite hidden away.
There we go.
I have to decide.
Now which of these two to use.
So these are the two substitutions I have to remember.
And the suggestion is to use this y equals u of x.
When m of x is a simpler equation than n of x.
Let's move down.
And to use this equation.
If n of x is simpler than m of x.
Now difficult to suggest which one of these are simpler.
But certainly I think we should go for this one.
X squared was y squared.
There's a bit of mix of terms there.
Certainly this one looks easier.
Subjective I suppose.
Can you see that?
Yeah.
This one looks simpler.
A simple equation.
Perhaps a simple equation.
Perhaps a simple equation.
And to use this equation.
If n of x is simpler than m of x.
Now difficult to suggest which one of these are simpler.
But certainly I think we should go for this one.
X squared was y squared.
There's a bit of mix of terms there.
Certainly this one looks easier.
As subjective I suppose.
Can you see that?
Yeah.
This one looks simpler.
As simple equation perhaps as this one.
So let's try for this first.
If it doesn't work.
You can always go for the second substitution.
So if I do substitute.
I'm going to be left with.
X squared.
Plus y squared is now going to be.
U squared.
Or x squared.
U squared.
Whichever way.
Dx.
Plus x squared.
Plus x and y.
So that is going to be.
U x squared.
D y.
Equals 0.
So I've just replaced this.
X times y.
Will now be.
X times.
U x.
That's.
U x squared.
Now.
In substitution.
And I've got two.
Variables.
U and x.
But I've got a y there.
I've got to get rid of that y.
So where I did.
Replace y equals.
U times x.
I've now got to look at.
What d y.
D x.
Is going to be.
Well that's going to be.
U.
U prime v.
So that's.
U d x.
Times x.
Plus.
U v prime.
So.
U of.
D x.
D x.
D x over d x.
Is just one.
I'm going to take this over.
To the other side.
So in differential form.
I'm going to have.
D y equals.
The d x's will cancel.
So it's going to be.
X d u.
Plus.
On the other side.
U d x.
So it's a simple.
Algebra here.
To get me to this.
Differential form.
One should actually.
Learn a lot more.
About differential forms.
But.
I suppose.
Various.
Um.
These courses.
Will leave that.
For.
For various times.
So I've got.
A replacement here.
So I've got.
The fact that.
X squared.
Plus.
X.
Plus.
X squared.
Plus.
U x squared.
Times.
X d u.
Plus.
U d x.
Equals.
Zero.
I've got to.
Simplify this.
And get the.
Terms for.
D x and d u.
Separately.
So I'm going to have.
X squared.
Plus.
U squared.
X squared.
Or.
X squared.
U.
X squared.
D x.
Plus.
X squared.
D x.
Plus.
U x cubed.
D u.
Plus.
U squared.
X squared.
D x.
Equals.
Zero.
Let's get all those.
D x's together.
That is going to be.
X squared.
Plus.
U squared.
X squared.
So that's those.
Done.
Plus.
U x squared.
U x squared.
That's that one.
Done.
And.
Did I leave.
Did I do a positive.
Or a negative.
Did I.
Let's just have a look.
Just let's have a look.
That I did not make a mistake.
Oh.
That's minus.
That can slip in so easily.
This was minus.
This was negative.
Okay.
So certainly we should have a few negatives here.
Negative.
Negative.
So that's.
That certainly.
And that.
And then a negative.
In there.
And a negative.
In there.
And a negative.
In there.
That was a negative up there.
Okay.
So.
On this side.
We'll have u squared.
U squared x.
Plus.
U x squared.
And then a minus.
A u squared x.
Plus.
U x squared.
And then a minus.
A u squared.
X squared.
And as far as the du's are concerned.
I'm going to have a.
X cubed.
There.
And there's another one.
Minus.
U x cubed.
Equals.
Zero.
There we go.
So easy to make a little mistake.
Let's carry on.
So Sydney.
Um.
Let's have a look.
Let's have a look.
Let's have a look.
X squared.
Plus.
X squared.
Plus.
X squared.
Plus.
X squared.
Plus.
X squared.
Plus.
X squared.
Plus.
X.
So this.
U squared.
X squared.
Minus.
U squared.
X squared.
Will go.
So I'm left with.
X squared.
Plus.
U x squared.
If you can see there.
So that's simple.
I'm going to take.
X squared.
Out.
As a common factor.
And I'm left with.
1.
Plus.
U.
D.
U.
Equals.
Zero.
Because I just need.
Uh.
I need to now.
Separate variables.
The.
The whole goal.
Of this substitution.
Is to get to an equation.
Where you can.
Separate variables.
So let's divide.
Through out.
By.
X cubed.
Looks to me.
Work.
X cubed.
X cubed.
X cubed.
That is going to.
Leave me with.
1.
Plus.
U.
D.
X.
Over.
X.
Plus.
1.
Minus.
U.
D.
U.
Equals.
Zero.
What can we do?
We can separate.
Variables.
As much as we can have.
1.
Minus.
U.
D.
X.
Over.
X.
I can bring this.
On this side.
So we have.
1.
Minus.
U.
Over.
1.
Plus.
U.
D.
U.
Equals.
Negative.
1.
Over.
1.
Plus.
U.
Um.
Let's say.
Positive.
Negative.
U.
Over.
1.
Plus.
U.
So I've just put.
The.
Each.
Part.
Of.
The numerator.
On its own.
Denominator.
So.
That's what we're left with there.
I'm just trying to simplify this.
This will be an easy integral.
This is still a difficult integral.
I'll tell you what we do.
Let's put the negative out here.
Just make life a bit simpler for ourselves.
So.
Let's do.
Substitution is not going to work here.
Let's do.
If that doesn't work.
Let's do.
Long division.
Long division.
Let's have.
U.
Plus.
Zero.
Plus.
Zero.
Etc.
And that's going to be divided by.
U.
Plus.
One.
For long division.
That is going to leave us with.
Once.
One.
That's going to be.
U.
Plus.
One.
So I'm left with a remainder of.
Minus.
One.
It's not going to help me to bring more down.
One.
Minus.
One.
Over.
U.
Plus.
One.
That's how remainders work.
So there's one.
Remember if you have.
Nine.
Divided by four.
It's going to be.
Two.
And I've got a.
Two times four is eighth.
And I've got a.
And I have a remainder of one.
So there would have been a two there.
So it's two.
And then I'm left with a remainder of one.
One of.
That fraction.
So I'm left with one.
And then whatever this.
Fraction.
So.
It's a negative one over that.
And you can.
You can check on that.
Let's have a.
U plus one.
Common.
Denominator for this.
So that will be.
On this side.
The U plus one.
And on this side.
The negative one.
Those two cancel.
So I'm back.
Left back.
With.
U.
Over.
One plus U.
So I'm left back there.
So this.
Is simply.
Going to simplify.
As one over.
One plus U.
And then.
I've got a distributor.
Minus.
In there.
Plus.
One over.
U plus one.
So that's what I'm going to be left with.
With.
After long division.
Separation.
First.
And then long division.
So.
I'm going to be left with this.
Two over one plus U.
Minus one.
As far as this is concerned.
Du.
Equals.
Minus one over.
X.
Dx.
I think you can't see there.
Let me move up.
So this is what I'm left with.
I've re.
I've rewritten this.
As this.
And then I did long division there.
Distributed the negatives in.
And certainly this is what I'm left with.
So if I now take the indefinite integral of both sides.
That'll leave me with.
Two times the indefinite integral.
One over.
One plus U.
Du.
Minus indefinite integral of.
Du.
Is going to equal.
Negative.
The indefinite integral.
One over.
X.
Dx.
These are much simpler to do.
So that's going to be.
Two times the natural log of the absolute value.
One plus U.
Minus.
Uh.
This is just going to be U.
And that is going to be equal to.
Negative.
The natural log of the absolute value of the.
X.
Plus some constant C1.
I can take this by the.
Properties of logarithms.
I can take this up.
Um.
I can certainly take this up.
Let's move that out the way I see.
Um.
Which will make this squared.
So I can get rid of the absolute value sign.
That's going to be natural log of one plus.
Uh.
U.
Squared.
And.
Minus.
U.
Equals.
I can put that up as.
Natural log of.
X to the power negative one.
Plus some constant C1.
I can exponentiate both sides.
If that's the correct term.
So here I'm going to be left with.
One plus U.
Squared.
And.
E to the power negative U.
Here I'm going to be left with.
X to the power negative one.
And.
E to the power.
C1.
C1.
Now remember.
Y equal.
E to the power.
X was my substitution.
In other words.
U equals.
Y over.
X.
So this is going to be.
1 plus.
Y over.
X.
Squared.
Times.
E to the power.
Negative.
Y over.
X.
Equals.
E to the power.
Y.
And.
X to the power.
Negative.
Y.
Now we've got to try.
And get some explicit.
Or.
We can.
We can stop there.
But let's carry on.
And just try and simplify.
These things a bit.
So that's going to be.
1 plus.
Y over.
X plus.
Y squared.
Over.
X squared.
I suppose I can just.
Multiply.
3 out.
By.
E to the power.
Y.
Over.
X.
And.
Times.
X to the power.
Negative.
One.
Let's see.
This video is getting.
Very long.
It's a fantastic problem.
If you think about it.
Let's multiply.
3 out.
By.
X.
X.
Plus.
2.
Y.
Plus.
Y squared.
Over.
X.
Equals.
C2.
E to the power.
Y.
Over.
X.
It's going to leave me.
With.
X squared.
Plus.
2.
X.
Y.
Plus.
Y squared.
Equals.
C2.
E to the power.
Y.
Over.
X.
X.
Plus.
Y.
Squared.
On the numerator.
I'm going to multiply.
Both sides.
By.
X.
To get rid of this side.
So that's going to leave me.
Some constant.
X.
E to the power.
Y.
Over.
X.
And I think that's the neatest.
I can get it.
That's the neatest.
I can get it to look.
Okay.
Went through this.
Quite rapidly.
A few important things.
To look at.
Initially.
You've got to go through those steps.
If it is exact.
If you can make it exact.
By integrating factor.
And then lastly.
By substitution.
Unfortunately for us.
Y equals.
U.
X.
Was a good substitution.
And then.
A bit of.
First year.
Calculus.
Just looking at.
Integration.
And.
Just how to deal with.
A few difficult.
Integrals.
Integrants.
There at least.
In.
