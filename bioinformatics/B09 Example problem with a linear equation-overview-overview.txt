The text explains solving a linear differential equation using the method of integrating factors. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Standard Form**: The given equation is a standard form linear differential equation, featuring a first derivative, constant coefficients, and no explicit function in the non-homogeneous term (\(f(x) = 0\)).

2. **Identifying Components**:
   - Coefficient of \(y'\) is 1.
   - Equation: \( y' - 3y = 0 \).
   - Here, \( p(x) = -3 \) and \( f(x) = 0 \).

3. **Interval**: The solution is valid over the entire real line due to continuous coefficients.

4. **Integrating Factor**:
   - Calculated as \( e^{\int p(x) \, dx} = e^{-3x} \).
   - This factor helps transform the equation into an exact differential form.

5. **Transformation and Solution**:
   - Multiplying by the integrating factor gives: 
     \[
     e^{-3x} y' - 3e^{-3x} y = 0
     \]
   - Recognized as the derivative of \( (e^{-3x} y) \).
   - Integrating both sides yields:
     \[
     e^{-3x} y = C
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \) provides: 
     \[
     y = Ce^{3x}
     \]

6. **Homogeneous Nature**: The equation is homogeneous, so the solution consists only of the complementary solution.

The text concludes by highlighting that this method yields a general solution for linear differential equations with constant coefficients.
