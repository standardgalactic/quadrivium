The text describes how to determine if a 2x2 square matrix has an inverse. The process includes calculating the determinant using the formula \(AD - BC\). For the given matrix with elements \(A = 3\), \(B = 1\), \(C = 6\), and \(D = 2\), the determinant is calculated as \(3 \times 2 - 1 \times 6 = 0\). Since the determinant is zero, division by zero occurs in the formula for finding the inverse, indicating that the matrix does not have an inverse. Consequently, this matrix is classified as a singular matrix.
