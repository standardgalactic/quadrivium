### Summary: Acute Subdural Hematoma Management

**Overview**:  
Acute subdural hematoma is a significant condition frequently encountered in severe traumatic brain injuries, affecting about 10-30% of such cases. It predominantly occurs in individuals aged 30-50 and shows a higher incidence in males.

**Clinical Presentation**:  
Patients typically present comatose with Glasgow Coma Scale scores between 3 and 8, often due to incidents like motor vehicle accidents, falls, or assaults.

**Non-operative Management**:  
Suitable for patients with clot thickness under 10 mm and midline shift less than 5 mm. Criteria include:
- Intracranial pressure monitoring.
- Neurological stability (no Glasgow Coma Scale deterioration).
- Normal pupillary responses.
- Intracranial pressure below 20 mmHg.

**Indications for Surgical Intervention**:  
Required if:
- Clot thickness exceeds 10 mm or midline shift is more than 5 mm.
- Progressive neurological deficits are observed.
- Uncontrolled increased intracranial pressure despite non-operative measures.
- Frontal or temporal contusions over 20 ml.
- Midline shift greater than 5 mm, cisternal compression, or clot volume exceeding 50 ml.

**Operative Management Options**:  
Includes:
- Subtemporal decompression
- Temporal lobectomy (aggressive)
- Hemispheric decompressive craniectomy

These surgeries are considered for young patients expected to experience significant brain swelling post-mass lesion removal.

**Conclusion**:  
Management depends on clinical assessments, with non-operative approaches used under specific conditions. Surgery is necessary in severe cases to prevent further neurological damage.

Additional considerations include:
- Depressed skull fractures complicate about 5% of head injuries and are linked with intracranial mass lesions and potential long-term deficits.
- Patients with skull fractures generally fare worse than those without such injuries.
- Surgical intervention is indicated for open or significantly depressed skull fractures to prevent infection, with recommended antimicrobial prophylaxis targeting gram-positive bacteria.
