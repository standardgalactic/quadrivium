The provided text is a tutorial on using the SymPy library in Python for factoring mathematical expressions. Hereâ€™s a concise summary:

1. **Importing and Setting Up**: 
   - Import necessary functions from SymPy (`symbols`, `factor`).
   - Enable pretty printing with `init_printing()` for better visualization.

2. **Defining Symbols**:
   - Define symbolic variables, such as `X` and `Y`, using `symbols('X Y')`.

3. **Expression Definition**:
   - Create the expression to be factored, e.g., \(3X + 9Y\).

4. **Factoring Process**:
   - Use the `factor()` function to factor the expression.
   - Example: Factoring \(3X + 9Y\) results in \(3(X + 3Y)\) by extracting the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the factored expression, e.g., `3(X + 3Y)`.

The tutorial also covers additional algebraic operations such as:
- Factoring polynomials like \(X^3 - Y^3\) into \((X - Y)(X^2 + XY + Y^2)\).
- Simplifying expressions using the `simplify()` function.
- Handling special cases like difference of squares, e.g., factoring \(X^2 - 9\) into \((X - 3)(X + 3)\).

Overall, the text demonstrates how SymPy facilitates symbolic mathematics and algebraic manipulations in Python.
