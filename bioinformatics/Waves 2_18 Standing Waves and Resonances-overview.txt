The text discusses interference patterns formed when two waves travel in opposite directions. It explains how these interactions lead to standing waves, characterized by varying amplitudes at different positions along a medium. The principle of superposition allows for the calculation of resultant wave amplitude using trigonometric identities. Specifically, it shows that two identical waves traveling in opposite directions can combine into a standing wave, with amplitude dependent on position but not traveling spatially.

The text also touches on identifying wave direction from given equations: positive terms indicate travel in negative \( x \)-direction and vice versa for negative terms. The author intends to further explore examples of standing waves and resonance without reiterating the basics covered in earlier materials.

Additionally, it highlights fundamental modes in a medium with different boundary conditions—closed at both ends, one end open/one closed, or both ends open—and mentions varying terminologies across textbooks regarding harmonic designations.

The text discusses terminology related to harmonics in three different situations involving waves. It explains that what was previously referred to as the "fundamental wave" is now being called the "first harmonic." Subsequent waves are named the "second harmonic," and so on. The author notes a potential for confusion because of differing terminologies used earlier, and emphasizes consistency with most textbooks which also use the term "first harmonic" for this initial wave in all situations.
