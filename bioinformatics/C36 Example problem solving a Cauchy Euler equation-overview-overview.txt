The text explains how to solve the second-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation \(x^2 y'' - 2xy' - 4y = 0\) using a specific substitution method. By assuming a solution of the form \(y = x^m\), it derives the first and second derivatives as \(y' = mx^{m-1}\) and \(y'' = m(m-1)x^{m-2}\). Substituting these into the original equation leads to an auxiliary quadratic equation: \(m^2 - 3m - 4 = 0\), which factors to \((m + 1)(m - 4) = 0\). The roots of this equation are \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = 4\). Therefore, the general solution is expressed as \(y = c_1 x^{-1} + c_2 x^4\), showcasing a power-based approach to solving such differential equations.
