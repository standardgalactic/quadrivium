In this exploration of an elastic collision between two carts on a frictionless air track, we are given the following scenario: A cart with a mass of 0.340 grams (converted to kilograms) is moving at 1.2 meters per second and collides elastically with a stationary cart of unknown mass. After the collision, the first cart slows down to 0.66 meters per second while continuing in its original direction.

The tasks are:
1. Determine the mass of the second cart.
2. Calculate its speed after the impact.
3. Find the speed of the center of mass for both carts.

To solve this problem, we use the principles of conservation of linear momentum and kinetic energy due to the nature of elastic collisions. The equations involved are:

- **Conservation of Linear Momentum:**
  \[
  m_1 \cdot v_{1i} = m_1 \cdot v_{1f} + m_2 \cdot v_{2f}
  \]

- **Conservation of Kinetic Energy:**
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} m_1 \cdot v_{1i}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \cdot v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \cdot v_{2f}^2
  \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass of the first cart (0.340 grams converted to kilograms),
- \( v_{1i} \) is the initial velocity of the first cart (1.2 meters per second),
- \( v_{1f} \) is the final velocity of the first cart (0.66 meters per second),
- \( m_2 \) is the mass of the second cart,
- \( v_{2f} \) is the final velocity of the second cart.

The solution involves isolating \( v_{2f} \) using the momentum equation and substituting it into the kinetic energy equation to solve for \( m_2 \). This requires algebraic manipulation to express one variable in terms of others and substitute back to find all unknowns. The speaker indicates that this process results in a mass of approximately 99 grams for the second cart, encouraging viewers to verify with their calculators.
