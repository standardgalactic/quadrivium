The text uses a fictional alien invasion scenario to explain the concept of mathematical limits and their applications in real-life situations. It introduces two equations: \( p(t) \), which models human population over time, and \( c(p) \), describing the alien infection rate turning humans into aliens.

- **\( p(t) \):** Represented by a red graph showing that the human population approaches a maximum limit of 20 as time goes to infinity. This suggests a cap due to resource limitations and human resistance.
  
- **\( c(p) \):** Illustrated by a blue graph, indicating an infection rate that increases indefinitely in theory. However, when combined with \( p(t) \), it forms a green line for \( c(p(t)) \). This shows that the actual infection rate is limited due to finite population and resistance.

The example demonstrates how limits predict future outcomes under constraints, such as disease spread where natural limits are reached. It underscores the value of mathematical modeling in fields like medicine, encouraging learning about limits for practical applications across various domains.
