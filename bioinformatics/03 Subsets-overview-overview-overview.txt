The text introduces fundamental concepts of abstract algebra related to sets within a universal set context:

1. **Universal Set**: A non-empty set encompassing all elements under consideration, essential for defining subsets.
2. **Proper Subsets**: Focuses on proper subsets of the universal set, which are necessary for operations like finding complements.
3. **Complement of a Set (A')**: Contains elements not in set A but within the universal set, requiring a defined universal context to be meaningful.
4. **Union of Sets (A1 ∪ A2)**: Combines elements from either or both sets A1 and A2, represented by logical OR and visualized with Venn diagrams.
5. **Intersection of Sets (A1 ∩ A2)**: Includes elements common to both sets A1 and A2, depicted using logical AND in Venn diagrams.
6. **Set Subtraction (A1 - A2)**: Consists of elements in A1 but not in A2, effectively removing the intersection with A2 from A1.

Additionally, the text explains expressing set difference \( A_1 - A_2 \) as \( A_1 \cap B' \), where \( B' \) is the complement of B. This equivalence will be proven using set theory axioms and definitions. Venn diagrams illustrate this by showing elements in \( A_1 \) but outside \( A_2 \), highlighting their intersection with \( B' \). The text promises a formal proof to establish this relationship, emphasizing that these concepts are foundational for understanding more complex algebraic structures and proofs.
