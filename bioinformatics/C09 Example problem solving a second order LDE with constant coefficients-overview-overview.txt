The text outlines a methodical approach to solving a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE):

1. **Identify the Problem**: Recognize that the given ODE is of second order, linear, and homogeneous.

2. **Formulate the Auxiliary Equation**: For an ODE in the form \(a y'' + b y' + c y = 0\), derive the auxiliary quadratic equation \(am^2 + bm + c = 0\). In this case, it is \(2m^2 - 5m - 3 = 0\).

3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**: Apply the quadratic formula \(m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) to find the roots:
   - Compute the discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = 25 + 24 = 49\).
   - The roots are calculated as \(m_1 = \frac{5 + 7}{4} = 3\) and \(m_2 = \frac{5 - 7}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Form the General Solution**: With real and distinct roots, the general solution is:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^{3x} + c_2 e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}
   \]
   where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants that can be determined by initial conditions.

5. **Conclusion**: The process underscores the significance of understanding how to derive and solve auxiliary equations for linear homogeneous ODEs, particularly when dealing with real and distinct roots.
