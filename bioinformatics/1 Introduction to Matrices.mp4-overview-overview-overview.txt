The introduction to matrices in linear algebra defines a matrix as an organized table of numbers arranged into rows and columns, typically enclosed in brackets and labeled with bold uppercase letters. Matrices are used for representing physical phenomena, vectors in physics, and systems of linear equations.

Mathematically manipulating matrices can solve systems of linear equations under specific conditions: no products or divisions of unknowns, variables raised only to the first power, and no logarithmic or trigonometric functions involved. Each element in a matrix is assigned an address based on its row and column position.

The text also describes various types of matrices, including square matrices (with equal numbers of rows and columns), symmetric matrices (elements mirror across the main diagonal), and diagonal matrices (all non-diagonal elements are zero).
