The lecture introduces complex numbers, building on the concept of the imaginary unit \( i \) where \( i^2 = -1 \). Complex numbers are represented as a set denoted by \( \mathbb{C} \), expressed in the form \( a + bi \) or \( x + iy \), with \( a, b, x, y \) being real numbers. The "real part" is \( a \) (or \( x \)) and the "imaginary part" is \( b \) (or \( y \)), multiplied by \( i \). Real numbers are a subset of complex numbers when their imaginary component is zero.

Complex numbers can be denoted by variables like \( z \) or \( w \), and both real and imaginary units (\( 1 \) and \( i \)) themselves are specific complex numbers with one part being zero. Complex numbers form an algebraic field, allowing for flexible notation without loss of generality. A complex number \( z = a + bi \) has its real part as \( \text{Re}(z) = a \) and imaginary part as \( \text{Im}(z) = b \). This structure facilitates understanding their construction and operations such as addition and multiplication, with practical applications across various fields.
