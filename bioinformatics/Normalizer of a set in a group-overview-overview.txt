The provided text discusses key concepts from group theory related to normalizers, bijections, and their implications in the study of groups. Here's a summary:

### Key Concepts

1. **Normalizer**:
   - The normalizer \( N_G(A) \) of a subset \( A \) within a group \( G \) consists of elements \( g \in G \) such that conjugation by \( g \) leaves \( A \) unchanged: \( gAg^{-1} = A \).
   - This means the subset is invariant under conjugation by any element in its normalizer.

2. **Mapping and Bijection**:
   - A mapping \( \sigma_g: A \to A \), defined as \( \sigma_g(a) = gag^{-1} \), is introduced.
   - To prove this mapping is bijective (one-to-one and onto), both injectivity and surjectivity are shown:
     - **Injectivity**: If \( \sigma_g(a_1) = \sigma_g(a_2) \), then \( a_1 = a_2 \).
     - **Surjectivity**: For every element \( b \in A \), there exists an \( a \in A \) such that \( \sigma_g(a) = b \).

3. **Two-Sided Inverse**:
   - The inverse of the mapping \( \sigma_g \) is given by \( \sigma_{g^{-1}}(b) = g^{-1}bg \).
   - This ensures that conjugation is reversible, confirming bijectivity.

### Implications

- **Structural Preservation**: The bijection indicates that conjugation by elements in the normalizer preserves the structure of \( A \). This property is significant for understanding symmetries and stabilizers within groups.
  
- **Normal Subgroups**:
  - If \( A \) is a subgroup of its own normalizer, it becomes a normal subgroup. This is because any element of \( A \), when conjugated by an element from the group, remains in \( A \).

### Conclusion

The text outlines how the concept of normalizers and bijections via conjugation helps characterize substructures within groups. It emphasizes the importance of these concepts for understanding symmetry and structural preservation in algebraic settings.

This theoretical framework is crucial for various applications in group theory, providing insights into subgroup relationships and stability under group operations.
