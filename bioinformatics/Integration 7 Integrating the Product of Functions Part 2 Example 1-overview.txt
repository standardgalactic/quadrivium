The text explains how to find the indefinite integral of the function \( x \cdot \sin(x) \) using integration by parts, which is analogous to the product rule for differentiation but applied in reverse. The general formula for integration by parts is:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

To apply this method, you must choose \( u \) and \( dv \), where \( u \) is a function of \( x \), and \( dv \) is the derivative of another function. In this example:

1. **First Choice**:
   - Let \( u = x \). Then, \( du = 1 \cdot dx \).
   - Let \( dv = \sin(x) \, dx \). The antiderivative of \( dv \), which gives \( v \), is \(-\cos(x)\).

Substituting these into the integration by parts formula:

\[
\int x \sin(x) \, dx = x(-\cos(x)) - \int (-\cos(x)) \cdot 1 \, dx
\]

Simplifying this expression:

\[
= -x \cos(x) + \int \cos(x) \, dx
\]

The antiderivative of \( \cos(x) \) is \( \sin(x) \), so:

\[
= -x \cos(x) + \sin(x) + C
\]

where \( C \) is the constant of integration.

2. **Alternative Choice**:
   - Let \( u = \sin(x) \). Then, \( du = \cos(x) \, dx \).
   - Let \( dv = x \, dx \). The antiderivative of \( dv \), which gives \( v \), is \(\frac{1}{2}x^2\).

Substituting these into the integration by parts formula:

\[
\int x \sin(x) \, dx = \sin(x) \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2\right) - \int \frac{1}{2}x^2 \cos(x) \, dx
\]

This approach results in a more complicated integral and is therefore less efficient.

Ultimately, the first choice provides a straightforward solution:

\[
\int x \sin(x) \, dx = -x \cos(x) + \sin(x) + C
\]
