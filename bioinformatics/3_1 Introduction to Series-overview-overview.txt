The text outlines the transition from understanding sequences to working with series in mathematics. A sequence is an ordered list of elements (e.g., \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\)), defined as \(a_n\) for \(n\) ranging from 1 to infinity. In contrast, a series is the sum of these terms expressed as partial sums, where each term in the sequence represents the cumulative total up to that point (e.g., for \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\), the partial sums are \(s_1 = a_1\), \(s_2 = a_1 + a_2\), etc.).

The key concept is analyzing these partial sums (\(s_n\)) as \(n\) approaches infinity to determine if a series converges or diverges. If the sequence of partial sums converges to a specific value \(L\), then the series converges to \(L\). If not, the series diverges.

The text sets the stage for further exploration into properties and operations involving series, including convergence tests and various mathematical operations like differentiation, integration, addition, multiplication, and division. Understanding sequences is crucial because it provides tools for analyzing the behavior of partial sums and thus determining the convergence or divergence of a series.
