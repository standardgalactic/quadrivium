This video discusses various treatments for Graves' disease beyond antithyroid drugs. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Beta Blockers**: These are essential alongside antithyroid medications to alleviate hyperthyroidism symptoms. Propranolol is notable for both blocking sympathetic responses and inhibiting T4 to T3 conversion. However, it should be avoided in asthmatic patients due to contraindications; calcium channel blockers may be used instead.

2. **Corticosteroids**: Although not first-line due to side effects, corticosteroids like prednisone (60-100 mg/day) are beneficial for managing Graves' ophthalmopathy. Intravenous administration can be more effective but requires careful liver function monitoring. They're recommended alongside radioactive iodine therapy to prevent worsening eye symptoms.

3. **Inorganic Iodides and Iodine Compounds**: These inhibit thyroid hormone production through the Wolf-Chaikov effect by blocking iodide oxidation and thyroglobulin proteolysis, with effects lasting only a few weeks before "escape" occurs (when normal hormone levels return). Lugol's solution or saturated potassium iodide is used pre-surgery to reduce thyroid vascularity. Sodium iopanoate and sodium ipadate can rapidly decrease T3 levels in emergencies like thyroid storm.

4. **Potassium Perchlorate**: Used with thionamides for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, it inhibits iodide transport but poses a risk of aplastic anemia, making long-term use undesirable.

The next video will explore treatments such as lithium carbonate, cholestyramine, and rituximab.

This text discusses various treatments for Graves' disease beyond antithyroid drugs. Here's a summary:

1. **Beta Blockers**: Propranolol is used to alleviate hyperthyroidism symptoms by blocking sympathetic effects and the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Caution is advised in patients with asthma, where calcium channel blockers may be preferred.

2. **Glucocorticosteroids**: Not recommended for initial treatment due to side effects but useful for Graves ophthalmopathy. Prednisone (60-100 mg/day) can control orbital symptoms in 60% of cases over several months. IV administration is more effective but has a higher risk of side effects. Prednisone may prevent worsening eye symptoms post-radioactive iodine therapy.

3. **Inorganic Iodides and Iodine Compounds**: 
   - The Wolf-Chaikov effect describes how excess inorganic iodide inhibits T3 and T4 production by blocking thyroglobulin proteolysis.
   - Effects are rapid but short-lived, with hormone production returning after a few weeks. Lugol solution or potassium iodide is used pre-surgery to reduce thyroid vascularity.

4. **Oral Cholecystography Agents**: Sodium iopanoate and sodium ipadate inhibit T4 deiodination, rapidly decreasing T3 levels and inhibiting hormone release. Long-term use can lead to a return of symptoms (escape phenomenon), so they are used mainly in thyroid storm or thyroxin overdose.

5. **Potassium Perchlorate**: Used with thionamides for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, it's a competitive inhibitor of iodide transport. Long-term use is discouraged due to the risk of aplastic anemia.

The next video will cover treatments like lithium carbonate, cholestyramine, and rituximab.
