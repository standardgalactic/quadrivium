This video discusses various treatments for Graves' disease beyond antithyroid drugs. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Beta Blockers**: These are essential alongside antithyroid medications to alleviate hyperthyroidism symptoms. Propranolol is notable for both blocking sympathetic responses and inhibiting T4 to T3 conversion. However, it should be avoided in asthmatic patients due to contraindications; calcium channel blockers may be used instead.

2. **Corticosteroids**: Although not first-line due to side effects, corticosteroids like prednisone (60-100 mg/day) are beneficial for managing Graves' ophthalmopathy. Intravenous administration can be more effective but requires careful liver function monitoring. They're recommended alongside radioactive iodine therapy to prevent worsening eye symptoms.

3. **Inorganic Iodides and Iodine Compounds**: These inhibit thyroid hormone production through the Wolf-Chaikov effect by blocking iodide oxidation and thyroglobulin proteolysis, with effects lasting only a few weeks before "escape" occurs (when normal hormone levels return). Lugol's solution or saturated potassium iodide is used pre-surgery to reduce thyroid vascularity. Sodium iopanoate and sodium ipadate can rapidly decrease T3 levels in emergencies like thyroid storm.

4. **Potassium Perchlorate**: Used with thionamides for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, it inhibits iodide transport but poses a risk of aplastic anemia, making long-term use undesirable.

The next video will explore treatments such as lithium carbonate, cholestyramine, and rituximab.
