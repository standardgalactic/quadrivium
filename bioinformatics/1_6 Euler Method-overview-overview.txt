The text explains how to use Euler's method to approximate solutions to differential equations when separation of variables is not possible. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Initial condition: \( (x_0, y_0) = (1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \).
   - Step size: \( h = 0.5 \).

2. **Euler's Method**:
   - Formula: \( y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n) \), where \( f(x, y) = \frac{x^3}{y} \).

3. **Steps and Calculations**:
   - **Step 0**: Start at \( x_0 = 1 \), \( y_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Compute \( a_0 = f(x_0, y_0) = \sqrt{2} \).
   - **Step 1**: Move to \( x_1 = 1.5 \). Calculate \( y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot a_0 = \frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Compute \( a_1 = f(x_1, y_1) = \frac{27\sqrt{2}}{16} \).
   - **Step 2**: Move to \( x_2 = 2 \). Calculate \( y_2 = y_1 + h \cdot a_1 = \frac{59\sqrt{2}}{32} \approx 2.607 \).

4. **Results**:
   - The approximate value at \( x = 2 \) is \( y_2 \approx 2.607 \).
   - The true value using the exact solution is approximately \( 2.8 \).

5. **Discussion**:
   - Euler's method provides an estimate with some error compared to the exact solution.
   - Smaller step sizes (e.g., 0.25 or 0.125) could improve accuracy.
   - The method involves estimating vertical movement (\( \Delta y \)) using the slope at a point and progressing through intervals (\( \Delta x \)).
   - If the curve is concave up, Euler's method underestimates; if concave down, it overestimates.
   - Practical applications include modeling phenomena like radioactive decay or biological growth.
   - Accurate calculations require precise decimal places.

The text underscores that while separable first-order differential equations can be solved directly, Euler's method is useful for estimating solutions to more complex equations.
