The text discusses how to understand and derive the intensity of an isotropic sound wave emanating from a point source. Initially, it introduces the concept that in three-dimensional space, energy per unit time (or power) passes uniformly through any spherical surface around the sound source.

The intensity (\(I\)) is defined as the average power per unit area (\(p_{\text{average}}/A\)), and a formula for this involves parameters such as frequency (\(\omega = 2\pi \times \text{frequency}\)), density (\(\rho\)), velocity of sound (V), and amplitude squared (\(s_m^2\)). The text further clarifies that the intensity can be expressed with the equation:

\[ I = \frac{1}{2} \rho V \omega^2 s_m^2 \]

The derivation provided explains kinetic energy in a small element of air affected by sound waves. It notes that while the wave moves forward, each particle's velocity is back and forth, related to the amplitude (\(s_m\)) of the oscillation.

Key steps in this derivation include:

1. Considering differential kinetic energy (\(dK = \frac{1}{2} dm v_x^2\)), where \(dm\) is a small mass element expressed as \(\rho A dx\).

2. Calculating velocity \(v_x\) from displacement \(s_m \cos(kx - \omega t)\) and deriving it with respect to time, leading to \(v_x = -s_m \omega \sin(kx - \omega t)\). The average value of \(\sin^2\) over a cycle is 1/2.

3. Substituting these into the expression for power (derivative of kinetic energy over time) and integrating with respect to area, leading ultimately to:

\[ I = \frac{1}{2} \rho V \omega^2 s_m^2 \]

This equation reflects both the average kinetic and potential energies in oscillating air particles due to sound waves.

The text discusses calculating sound intensity from a line source rather than a point source. A spark jumps a 10-meter gap, emitting 1.6 × 10⁴ watts of sound energy uniformly along this line. To find the intensity at a radius of 12 meters away, it considers a cylindrical surface surrounding the line source.

Using the formula for intensity (power per unit area), the intensity is calculated by dividing the power by the lateral surface area of a cylinder with height equal to the length of the line and radius equal to the distance from the source. The calculation yields an intensity of approximately 21 watts per square meter at 12 meters away.

The text further explores placing a small detector with a surface area of 2 cm² in this field to determine the power received by it. Converting units appropriately, it finds that the detector receives about 4.1 milliwatts of power.

This scenario demonstrates an alternative method for calculating sound intensity from a linear source rather than a point source, using cylindrical geometry instead of spherical.
