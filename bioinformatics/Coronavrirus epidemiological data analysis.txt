It's Sunday and I'm working at the University of Cape Town campus. We're
going to have a cabinet meeting in South Africa today. I'm sure we're going to
find out that there's going to be severe restrictions and I'm sure the
University is going to make plans to certainly close many of the campuses.
What I want to talk to you about is an introduction to two videos. I'm going to
use the same introduction for two videos and that's on the data analysis of open
data that's available for the coronavirus. Now the Wolfram repository, data
repository, has three datasets that's available. It comes from the WHO and it's
updated very regularly. Just mind that when you do the data analysis it's going
to look slightly different from the data analysis that I'm going to do because it
is regularly updated. It does lag a few days behind so you're going to see data
up till a couple of days ago. So we're going to do two videos. I'm going to show
you data analysis, one on the medical data that the WHO has made available and one
on the epidemiological data. So as I said the same the same introduction video is
going to be for both. So I do have courses on the use of the Wolfram
language for data analysis specifically for the health care related field. The
Wolfram language of course lends itself beautifully to data analysis and then the
data repository has a lot of open source data curated by the Wolfram research
so that we can use the data in our analysis. So there's a lot of data
analysis videos Wolfram themselves make some but I want to give you just
something from the perspective of a doctor from a surgeon working in a
hospital where we are preparing for the management of these patients. So have a
look at these the videos as I said one is going to be on the epidemiological data
and one is going to be on the medical data and the use of the data analysis. If
you want to learn more about the use of the Wolfram language of course I do have
courses you can get a University of Cape Town certificate through Coursera if
you take the course on the use of the Wolfram language for biostatistics. So
let's go and explore this data set some of the data is sparse it's difficult I
think and for the world to to gather this type of data in as much as a
worldwide effort to try and collect this data so some of the data is going to be
a bit sparse specifically when it comes to data say for instance about the
symptomatology the symptoms of the patients but it is a large data set and we
can still learn a lot from it and that's what all this is about when I teach
healthcare statistics data science data analysis I really really urge people to
to get to the story that the data is trying to tell you there's information
lock in that and that information is knowledge and that is exactly what we
need right now so let's analyze some of this data I'll show you how to use the
Wolfram language to do this so let's go have a look. So here we are in the
Wolfram desktop as I mentioned in the other video that I've made on the
coronavirus using the Wolfram data repository data on the coronavirus
pandemic is that you can do this in your browser in the Wolfram cloud
absolutely free of charge but I'm using the Wolfram desktop here on my own
system the first place to go and find out some useful information on the
coronavirus of course is on Wolfram Alpha and you can see I've just passed the
string coronavirus as an argument to the Wolfram Alpha function here and it's being
interpreted as a medical diagnosis and you can get some information there you can
also of course click on there and interpret it as a species specification
and you're going to get some information about the taxonomy and the size etc of this
virus so always remember the Wolfram Alpha there what we are interested in is
the Wolfram data repository and we're going to use the resource search as a
function and again pass the string coronavirus to get the information on the
datasets that are available the curated datasets on the coronavirus now this
comes from the WHO I think via Johns Hopkins this data is available as open
source data curated here for the Wolfram data repository so easy for us to use
inside of the Wolfram language the data is updated regularly but it's not
completely up-to-date so the data that I'm working with here today is up-to-date for
today it will always be up-to-date as far as what is available on the servers but
it's going to be lag a few days behind the actual date and we can see the three
datasets that are out there we've already looked at the patient medical data in
another video and I'll certainly put that information in the description down
below and here we're going to look at the epidemic data dataset and for those of
interest for you interested and with knowledge in the genetic sequencing
there's a fantastic dataset on that as well but in this video we're going to
look at the epidemic data so let's open this up and we're going to import that
with the resource data function as we can see there let's increase the size of the
screen here I think that might make it a bit easier to read let's go to 150% and
we'll go full screen here that might make it easier for us to to read so resource data and
then I'm just passing the name as we can see the name here epidemic data for
novel coronavirus COVID-19 and I'm passing that exactly as a string and that
is going to import the data to my local system from the Wolfram data repository so
that might just take a second or two especially way down here in the southern
hemisphere where I am accessing this dataset from and there we go fantastic
dataset we can see some of the columns there and it goes on and on we can scroll to the
right this recovered cases confirmed cases geoposition country and administrative data
so typical for epidemiological data and we see some of this data is saved as time series
themselves so that column with a cell actually has a bunch of values in it and you can see
the time series here already until the 13th of March 52 data points when you run the code
you're going to see different data points as always when you start analyzing the data let's
look at the statistical variables and so the column names column headers and I'm going to use the normal
function epi data is the name of my data set the first row the keys that I'm interested in and we see
the statistical variables the administrative division country geoposition confirmed cases recovered cases
and deaths now as always with the data sec that comes from the data repository you might be
interested in some more information on that and we can use the resource object function pass the name
of the data set and I'm going to store this in a computer variable called epi data resource and that
resource has a lot of properties in it and always when it has these properties I like to use the
manipulate function and I pass this list as something that I can select inside of manipulate so I'm using
this temporary computer variable here in and I'm going to just we can just select any of those
properties using manipulate so I can drop down there and just click on any of these and it'll give me the
information from that property instead of having to type in all of the different properties every
time so certainly something I like to do so as with epidemiological data let's start looking at a
couple of countries and let's have a look at how there's been this increase in the cases as pandemic
as any pandemic will develop when we talked about the medical data I did mention and I'll mention it
here as well even though if we scroll up we see these strings here China Sweden that is not how it's saved
inside of the data set it is saved as entities and if you just look for the string value there you're not
going to find that so we have to save this as an entity now there's various ways to extract an entity
just using freeform using the entity function but I'm using the interpreter function here as I'm saying
please interpret Italy past as a string as a country please so that if I run that and I stored in a
computer variable such as Italy this is this entity here is what is saved inside of the data set so that
is what I would have to search for so let's create this new data set that only has data on Italy inside
of it how would I do that a couple of ways that I can do what I'm going to do here is just use notation
straight from a data set so I start with a data set name and then I'm going to select and I'm going
to say match queue so in the medical data I actually use different syntax to do exactly the same thing so
there's quite a few ways that you can go about it so here's another way for you to go about it so I'm
saying match queue so it's only going to select it if that is include indeed included and what do I
want to match I'll go down the country column and I use the little ampersand there to go down that whole
column row by row therefore we use the hashtag symbol there so hashtag country and the country we're
looking for is this entity value Italy so it's only going to include data from Italy so let's run that and
we see there's only one row dedicated to Italy some countries you'll see that it goes by province
or territory or state and we'll get quite a bit of information but for Italy it's all captured in the
same way and we can see the time series here and we can see little graphs so we can see this rapid growth
in the number of cases there so let's have a look at that confirmed cases I want to extract that so I'm
going to say Italy epi all the rows see the double square brackets here so I'm using indexing row comma
column so all the as far as the rows are concerned give me all the values and then in the confirmed
cases so what we are going to get back if there's only one row so it's only going to give me this row
this column so it gives me back this time series now the time series data that comes from all over the
world is being captured by different people and let me be brutally honest there's a bit of work to
be done when you want to extract this data first of all let's just do a datelist plot on this data
and so we're going to say datelist plot Italy confirm cases TS and putting that inside as you can see
here inside of curly braces to make it a list and the image size is large and I've just done some plot labels there
and this is the unfortunate picture that we can see here starting on 27th of January here until after the 9th of
of March we can see the scale here the number of cases are very very very very unfortunate we can see this rapid rise in the number of cases there
let's look at the recovered cases so let's extract that time series I'm just using indexing there so all the rows in there
it's just a single row of the recovered cases and now we can plot them both so let's plot them with a show function so we can do two datelist plots
in exactly the same and exactly the same plot and we can see the lag behind in the recovered cases as far compared to the recovered cases
compared to the confirmed cases and we can see also the date of this information lags a bit behind
but certainly there is a good rise here in the number of recovered cases being documented
now I want to extract the numerical values only so the datelist plot has done a wonderful job of just extracting the actual values and the dates
so that we can have this beautiful lines but to do it by hand takes a bit of extraction
unfortunately there's also a bit of discrepancy between each of the time series you have to extract these values in a bit of a different way
and you have to play around you'll have to play around a little bit
so I'm going to for this instance I know what works here I've looked at it before I'm going to use the apply function
and I want to apply list to the Italy confirmed cases TS time series
now if we look at here this is what I've saved it as Italy recovered cases TS
that was just my computer variable name and I just went for that cell in that column
so I got this time series object there and this is how I'm going to extract it
I know that that works well in the extraction of that
so I love that and now this is what I get
time series 52 if I click on that I see inside of that I have the actual numbers which is what I'm after
now if I can spell this correctly that N should certainly not be there
let's take that away
the other way to construct the supply function of course is shorthand notation
to say list at Italy confirmed cases TS was my variable name there
so let's just correct that all now because I'm going to put some information in the description down below
so that you can download the notebooks for yourself
so I have this in this format but it's still not what I'm after
I'm after this little bitty here that's what I'm after
so all I'm going to do is ask for this again just by shorthand and pass that to the normal function
and let's see what I get from that
now I get this nested list where I have a date object here
and the number of cases
I'm certainly getting closer to what I want to do
and that's what you have to do with this date information
just play around with it a little bit until you get back exactly what you want
now this is great for me because I'm going to pass this as the values at least to a time series model fit function
there we go
because what we are going to try and attempt to do here is just to create some model
now there's certainly not enough numbers here
it's too early in the pandemic to just use very simple time series model fits here to predict the future
but certainly there's enough data here for us to attempt this
and I'm going to simplify it
I'm just going to use a couple of functions here
but then just to give you the idea of the power that's locked up here and that you could unleash
so I'm returning exactly this list
I could have saved it in a computer variable but I haven't
so there it still is the normal and then do all of that
but what I am extracting is only the numbers
so it's the second of the set of elements
the nested values
so I'm only extracting those numbers
so I'm just passing all of those sequential numbers
0, 0, 0
you can see it started at 0 cases in Italy on that day
0, 0 and then it started to ramp up
so I'm only passing that specific sequence of values
to the time series model fit
so this is time series analysis
very complicated topic
and what I'm not going to do here is pass a specific type of model here
so I'm not going to say autoregression or moving average
or autoregression moving average
or integrated version of that RIMA or CERIMA
which is built seasonality into that
if you know anything about time series analysis
you can certainly specify here what time series you want
I'm just going to let the wellframe language decide on its own what to do
based on the values that I do give it
and you can see here already
it's given me back a time series model
and with a bit of information on that
and it's chosen the seasonal RIMA there for us
as the method for constructing this model
now it has a bunch of properties
again remember you can use the manipulate function to go over all of these
but that's certainly all the properties that are available in my model
I can get more information on the model by just passing the model to the normal function
and you can see the information on the CERIMA process
the CERIMA process remember the function side of the Wolfram language
and you can see some information on that there
so what I want to do now is use the time series forecast function
there we go, the time series forecast function
I'm passing my model which I've saved under TSM Italy
and I want the next 10 days
can you predict for me, can you forecast
the number of cases that we're going to see in the next 10 days
after the data, the date at which this data stops
I'm going to pass that to a list line plot
so first of all I'm going to do the dates that I do have
and that is this property temporal data of my model
so that's the actual values that I do have
and then I'm going to use time series forecast
to plot a prediction of what we might see in Italy
and where we stand in the epidemic and with the CERIMA model
unfortunately that's what it looks like
now I'm pretty sure that's hopefully not how it's going to pan out
but this was all just set by default
and certainly if you are familiar with time series analysis
you can do a much better job at this
but I wanted to show you just how easy it is
just to then plot the data that we do have
and then the forecast, the forecast that we can make from a model
so certainly as far as this very simplified version is concerned
that those cases of course does not look good at all
now let's go just in contrast to that
to a place where we have already seen
that the number of cases have started to plateau
and even come down
and if we go right back up to the data
we'll see the first row there is on Hubei
so I'm going to call it Hubei confirm cases time series
so I'm only extracting that time series from row one
and there we go
there's indeed a time series
and you can see the little plateau that has gone there
now to extract these values from that time series
I had to do something different
it was captured in a different way
so instead of what we did for Italy
this is what worked for me
again just applying the list function to those values
and I've had to use this indexing to extract that
and then I've passed that all to the flatten function
so that I have this number of cases that we've had before
now this time I'm going to pass all of these numbers
to the time series model fit again
and this time I'm specifying the method
that I want the time series analysis to be
and that's going to give me my model
remember I can extract all of those things from the model
but what I want to do again
all the properties
but what I want to do is a list line plot
of the actual values that we have now
these
and then the time forecast over
what is going to happen in the next 10 days
and we can see certainly the difference here in Hubei province
in China as far as the forecast is concerned
so please do a much better job than I've done here
I just want to show you how easy it is to use the Wolfram language
to do time series analysis
I couldn't help myself
I just wanted to look at the United Kingdom as well
through family that I do have in the United Kingdom
so remember I have to pass this as
or find at least an entity value for United Kingdom
I'm going to use the select function on the epi data again
so that I only have a time
or data set at least that has the United Kingdom inside of that data set
and the one that contains the real data here
is this first row
is what we are interested in
so let's look at this time series of this first row
so I'm just using normal indexing there
row 1 and then the confirmed cases
and we pass that
and I'm saving that as a computer variable
and let's have a look at that plot
where we stand for this data set
as far as the UK is concerned
and it unfortunately looks the same
as in other places
in that we see this jump
now I'm going to do this all in one
the extraction of this again
a little bit different from the way we did for Italy
before
and for Hubei province
but I'm also just going to
very simplified
I'm just going to use Surima there
I have a model
and we can again look at
what the forecast looks there
for the next 10 days
after the values that are available here
so certainly again predicting this increase
one more
one more
one more
let's look at Australia entity
there we go Australia
I'm just going to have Australia
as a
as the
selection criteria there
and we can see
it was broken down into
all these different territories
New South Wales
Victoria
South Australia
Western Australia
etc
and I just want to show you
how easy that would be
for us just to have a look
at the time series of all of that
so have a look at the line of code
there
what I wanted to show you there
is just
if you click on any of these
we're going to see that time series
for that row
so
the time series for that row
this is how I extracted it in this instance
and if we do a dateless plot
on all of those combined
I'm saying up to number 7
because certainly if we go look here
this last one
I don't want this empty row here to be included
but there we can see
the numbers for the different territories there
and we can see the northern territory there
with the
at the bottom with the lowest infection rate
one more thing we might have a look at
that this confirmed
this epidemiological data of course
is the different countries
so what we've done here is to start with the epi data
all the data in the country column
please return that for me as a list
so I've passed that to the normal function here
delete all the missing values for me
delete the duplicates
and then sort
sort it for me
so if we do that
we can see this alphabetical sort of all the countries that have been affected
and just look at that sorry list
unfortunately very few places have been spared from this epidemic
this pandemic I should say
let's plot this as a Geographics
and we can certainly see here Antarctica seems to have been spared
but everywhere else looks looks pretty much unfortunately affected by this
I'm going to group by country
so I'm going to use epi data
so that's normal data set notation epi data
and then the group by function
so group by country
and I want the totals
and I want the confirmed cases
and from confirmed cases I just want the last value
because confirmed cases are going to be a time series
but I just want the last value inside of that
which will give us the latest view as far as this data set is concerned
so there we go
China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain
all the unfortunate things we've seen in the news there
so let's just go for
a region plot here
a Geo value region plot
and if we set the plot range to about 5000
it's going to give us a good colour difference between all the countries
as far as to differentiate in a map
of how the different countries have been affected
and you see the legend here on the left hand side
so the yellow would be for less than a thousand cases
and then the higher up we go
we do know that China was the first epicentre
of course unfortunately Iran there
and then of course Europe
that has become the new epicentre for the continuation of this pandemic
so let's just have a look at the United States
if we want to use this epidemic data
of course there's the entity
and I'm only going to select cases from the USA
we've seen how to do that now with a select function
and let's do a Geo region plot of that
I am going to group by the administrative division
that is going to give us the different states I think
Washington, New York, California, Massachusetts
there we see the different states
and I want the last value again of the confirmed cases
and the plot range
we're dealing with a lot fewer patients here
when we compare that to the whole world
so I'm going to set the plot range to about 100
so we can get some idea of how the different states
in the United States have been affected
and you can see Texas there
you can see Miami
you can see California
with the highest number of cases unfortunately
let's do the top 100 countries
that is always a plot that we might want to include
when we talk about something like the epidemiological data
so I'm going to sort the epi data
I'm going to group by country
again I'm going to take the last value
and we're only going to take the first 11
so I'm using indexing there
it's saying give me the first 11
because I am just doing that group by
and I only want the first 11 back
otherwise it becomes too much to plot
so there we go
the top countries there
now when I ran this data set before
there's certainly been a cruise ship or two
that has been included in this
and I see in the latest data that has been removed
and if it still shows up for you
what you can do then
is just use this key drop function
so key drop function
you can specify then what you want
what key you want dropped
and that for me is not a country
cruise ship was one of the countries
that did appear in this list
so certainly if you want to remove that
so normal is of course it's going to give us
the entity themselves
and then we're going to see how many cases there are
again we could drop that
in association if that was available
if the cruise ship still appeared
cruise ship still appeared here
because we're just interested in the countries
but now we can just do a normal bar chart
with this association
I'm setting the plot theme to business here
it's a well drawn plot here
and we can see China here at the bottom
still with the most number of cases
and then we can see Italy etc
just a little bit of code here
if you just want to extract the values separately
there's the countries
and I'm converting them to names here
so that we can add them as far as the plot is concerned
we can extract from the association that we have there the values
so now we have the values and the name
and we can use a bar chart
a different type of bar chart
so that we have a legend on the right hand side
that shows us the different countries and colours
so two ways for us just to set that up with the numbers
in case you wanted a different look for your plot
there's some useful information for you there
how to extract that
so all in all pretty grim
from a medical point of view
from a surgeon's point of view
where we are looking in our own country
about how to deal with this pandemic
and what it might mean to our health services
it's great to have this information available
the Warframe language makes it very easy for us to extract
and there's certainly a ton more information in these data sets
that I haven't touched here
that if you have some questions that we can perhaps sit together
I'm quite happy to help you through this data set
and to extract some of this data just leave some comments down below
you know how to contact me
this is also done for my students on Coursera
where I have three courses
one on medical statistics
introduction to medical statistics
which is the leading course of course on medical statistics
as far as the MSF open online courses are concerned
I also have a course specific
two biostatistics using the Warframe language
and for those students I hope
I'm going to leave a message on Coursera
for you to watch these videos
and that you find these successful
as I said there's a ton more information on here
some information that every one of us can use locally
and certainly some of this data
and the results that we will look at locally
locally in the hospitals and the academic complex
at the University of Cape Town
where I am a surgeon
