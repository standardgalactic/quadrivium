The text provides a mathematical exercise involving vector norms in Euclidean space. The main task is to demonstrate that scaling a vector by the reciprocal of its norm results in a unit vector.

### Exercise Breakdown:

1. **Norm and Scaling:**
   - Given a vector \( \mathbf{V} = (V_1, V_2, V_3) \), calculate its norm:
     \[
     \| \mathbf{V} \| = \sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}
     \]
   - Scale the vector by \( \frac{1}{\| \mathbf{V} \|} \), resulting in a new vector:
     \[
     \left( \frac{V_1}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}}, \frac{V_2}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}}, \frac{V_3}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}} \right)
     \]
   - The norm of this new vector is calculated as:
     \[
     \sqrt{\left(\frac{V_1}{\| \mathbf{V} \|}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{V_2}{\| \mathbf{V} \|}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{V_3}{\| \mathbf{V} \|}\right)^2}
     \]
   - Simplifying, this results in:
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}} = \sqrt{1} = 1
     \]
   - Thus, scaling the vector by its reciprocal norm yields a unit vector.

2. **Scalar Calculation:**
   - Given \( \mathbf{V} = (-2, 3, 0, 6) \), find scalar \( K \) such that:
     \[
     \| K \mathbf{V} \| = 5
     \]
   - The norm of \( \mathbf{V} \) is:
     \[
     \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
     \]
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     |K| \times 7 = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |K| = \frac{5}{7}
     \]
   - Therefore, \( K = \pm \frac{5}{7} \).

The exercise demonstrates vector normalization and scalar manipulation in Euclidean space.

The text provides a mathematical exercise involving vectors in Euclidean space, focusing on demonstrating that a normalized vector has a norm of 1. Here's a summary:

1. **Normalization of a Vector:**
   - Consider a vector \( \mathbf{V} = (V_1, V_2, V_3) \).
   - The goal is to show that the normalized version of this vector, obtained by dividing each component by the norm of the vector, results in a vector with a norm of 1.
   - The norm of \( \mathbf{V} \) is calculated as \( \sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2} \).
   - Normalizing \( \mathbf{V} \) involves dividing each component by this norm: 
     \[
     \left( \frac{V_1}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}}, \frac{V_2}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}}, \frac{V_3}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}} \right)
     \]
   - Calculating the norm of this new vector shows that it equals 1, confirming normalization.

2. **Scalar Multiplication Problem:**
   - A separate problem involves finding scalar values \( K \) such that the norm of \( K\mathbf{V} \) equals a specific value.
   - Given \( \mathbf{V} = (-2, 3, 0, 6) \), and the condition that the norm of \( K\mathbf{V} \) is 5:
     \[
     |K| \times \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 + 6^2} = 5
     \]
   - The norm of \( \mathbf{V} \) is calculated as \( \sqrt{4 + 9 + 36} = 7 \).
   - Solving for \( |K| \), we find \( |K| = \frac{5}{7} \), leading to \( K = \pm\frac{5}{7} \).

These exercises illustrate vector normalization and scalar multiplication in Euclidean spaces.
