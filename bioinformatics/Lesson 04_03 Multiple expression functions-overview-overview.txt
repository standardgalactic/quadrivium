The provided text introduces defining and using functions in Julia by covering various aspects of function syntax and behavior:

1. **Function Declaration**: Functions in Julia are declared with the `function` keyword, followed by a name (e.g., `MLTPL`) and arguments (e.g., `X`, `Y`). Unlike Python, there's no colon after argument lists; blocks are defined using indentation.

2. **Return Values**: A function can explicitly return values using `return`. If omitted, the last evaluated expression is returned implicitly, allowing multiple expressions to be treated as a tuple when separated by commas.

3. **Examples**:
   - *MLTPL*: Prints a message and returns the product of two arguments.
   - *MLTPL2*: Similar to `MLTPL`, but uses implicit return for the last expression.
   - *MLTPL3*: Demonstrates that only the final expression's result is returned without an explicit `return`.

4. **Returning Multiple Values**: Functions can return multiple values as tuples, which can be unpacked into separate variables.

5. **Optional Arguments and Defaults**: The text hints at future coverage on optional arguments and default values but does not explore these concepts in detail.

This overview sets the foundation for understanding basic function creation and behavior in Julia, with more advanced features like optional parameters to be discussed later.
