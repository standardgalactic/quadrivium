and then what do we give our patients most of our patients we can ensure which
is just a caloric supplement of protein and it's tolerated by most of our
patients then you can start going down to more semi elemental and elemental
feeds I haven't seen us using things like pectomin and allotrachea I remember we
used it a lot for example red cross we had children who had like post gastro
bowel failure who just couldn't absorb anything so a lot of those malabsorptive
disorders you give them a semi digested food so that their GIT doesn't have to
work so hard in absorbing it also those people often have many enzyme
deficiencies like an acute lactose deficiency these elemental feeds are
for people like that then parental feed so this is this is the white stuff that
goes into the vein and this you can give when internal nutrition is really not
possible or to top up when you're not meeting your caloric needs through
internal nutrition and these are these malabsorptive states like I spoke about
the kids who have post diarrhea malabsorption people who've got short
bowel syndrome after extensive resection of their bowel anybody with complete
bowel obstruction cannot be fed and then patients are in a catabolic state with no
GI access for five to seven days so these are your baseline malnourished
patients who then have a major catastrophic event once again because it's
most common in our setting like a severe gangrenous appendix in a patient who was
previously marasmic those patients will do very badly if you don't try and feed
them early and if they've got a major ileus and you just really can't get gut
feeding going and parental nutrition is an option and then high output
intra-cutaneous fistulae with no distal access and then there are lots of other
cases head injuries and yeah many other situations and then how to give it you
can either give it centrally or peripherally I have not seen people giving
TPN through peripheral line in terms of complications the peripheral line you're
you're less likely to get central sepsis but you have to change the line every day
they're more likely to get peripheral phlebitis and it's just more labor-intensive a central
line you would insert what a central venous catheter but parental feeds have a lot of
complications and those first are catheter related and so any complication of
a central venous catheter you can get and that's a hemo pneumothorax brachial
plexus injury you can get thrombosis of that vein and one of the most
devastating complications is sepsis which needs to be managed very aggressively
then you also get so here's a bit of a typo there metabolic complications so the
patients can become hyperglycemic it's very important to maintain tight
glycemic control they're also like I said refilling and syndrome acid-based
disturbances and metabolic disorders and then they get vitamin deficiencies so these
patients need aggressive supplementation as well and then you get HPP
complications because your TPN is completely bypassing your hepatic
sort of circulation your normal nutrients absorbed into the portal circulation go
through the liver become more processed there and then go into your systemic
circulation this is bypassed with TPN and you get raised liver enzymes you tend to get
cholestasis and gallbladder dysfunction these patients have a high risk of a
a calculus cholecystitis and then you can also get severe liver complications like
liver failure and cirrhosis and then other nutritional support options available to us
include immunonutrition so you know this is immunonutrition is when you attempt to
modulate the immune system by intervening with nutrients and it's mostly
attempts to improve the clinical course of critically ill patients so these are
usually ICU patients and you target three immune three immune systems firstly the
mucosal barrier function your cellular defense and then your local and
systemic inflammation and then the nutrients we use most often often are
argoline, glutamine, selenium, branched-chain amino acids, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids
have now been turn to some benefit and then nucleotides like I said these are
mostly used in ICU situations then there's lots of talk these days about probiotics which
is a live microorganism which when administered in adequate amounts confers a
health benefit to the individual or the host and traditionally these are
traditionally these are your fermented dairy products like yogurt, sour milk,
mass but now we can give it in tablet form and there's a lot of research into
whether or not this improves things like diarrhea or gastroenteritis and
actually almost any disease stage you can think of inflammatory bowel disease
helicobacter pylori colonization irritable bowel syndrome and then trace
elements of micronutrients I think you guys might have seen from any of our
chronically ill patients or our burns patients we write up things like zinc
sulfate and vitamin C and this is to replace micronutrients that your patient might be deficient in
yeah and I think it's just important it's something that we overlook and we don't think about very much and
also I'll be honest in our setting is not particularly easy to manage we don't
have many options here and in many ways we don't have the expertise to manage tube
feeds very well but good nutrition pays and it's something to always keep in mind
when you have an ill patient
