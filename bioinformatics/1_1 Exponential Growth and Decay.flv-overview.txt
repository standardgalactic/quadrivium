This text introduces first-order differential equations and their application to modeling exponential growth or decay. It begins by defining a differential equation as an equation involving an unknown variable \( y \) and its derivative. The discussion focuses on how the rate of change of a quantity is proportional to the current amount, leading to an equation of the form:

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = ky \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

The text illustrates this concept using examples from biology, such as modeling the growth of organisms in a culture. The solution to this differential equation involves integrating both sides and applying algebraic manipulation to isolate \( y \):

\[ y = ae^{kt} \]

Here, \( a \) represents the initial quantity (e.g., number of organisms), and \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

A practical example is provided: an experiment where the growth of bacteria in a culture medium is tracked. Initially, there are 100 organisms, and after 60 minutes, the count increases to 450. Using these data points, the constant \( k \) can be determined through:

\[ 4.5 = e^{60k} \]

Taking the natural logarithm leads to finding \( k \), allowing prediction of organism growth at any time \( t \):

\[ y = 100e^{kt} \]

This demonstrates how differential equations model real-world exponential processes and provide predictions based on initial conditions.

The text discusses mathematical models for predicting the growth and decay of organisms using exponential functions. Specifically, it covers two scenarios: exponential growth of microorganisms in a culture medium and exponential decay of carbon-14 over time.

1. **Exponential Growth**:
   - The model describes how to calculate the number of organisms at any given time \( t \) (in minutes) using an equation involving the natural logarithm, expressed as \( N(t) = 100 e^{(\ln(4.5)/60)t} \).
   - It discusses determining the doubling time for these organisms by solving \( 200 = 100 e^{(\ln(4.5)/60)t} \), which simplifies to finding \( t \) when the population doubles from 100 to 200, and similarly for further doublings.
   - The constant nature of the doubling time is emphasized, regardless of the initial number of organisms.

2. **Exponential Decay**:
   - Using carbon-14 as an example, the text illustrates exponential decay with a half-life of 5,730 years.
   - Starting with 50 grams of carbon-14, the model predicts how much remains after any given time, specifically calculating it for 100 years using the equation \( y = 50 e^{kt} \).
   - It demonstrates finding the decay constant \( k \) by utilizing the known half-life to solve \( 25 = 50 e^{5730k} \), leading to calculations that determine how much carbon-14 remains after a specified period.

The text highlights the mathematical principles underlying both growth and decay processes, emphasizing their applications in fields like microbiology and radiocarbon dating.

The text discusses an equation related to exponential decay involving a constant \( k \). The value of \( k \) is calculated as:

\[ 
k = \frac{\ln(\frac{1}{2})}{5730} = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}
\]

This indicates that the process described involves exponential decay because \( k \) is negative. An example equation provided is:

\[ 
y = 50 \cdot e^{\left(-\frac{\ln(2)}{5730} \times t\right)}
\]

In this context, \( y \) represents the quantity remaining after time \( t \), starting with an initial amount of 50. For instance, if you want to find out how much remains after 100 years, you would substitute \( t = 100 \) into the equation. The negative value of \( k \) confirms that this is a decay process rather than growth.

The text provides an introduction to solving first-order differential equations using the context of exponential growth or decay, particularly through a biological example involving microbial populations. It starts by explaining what a differential equation is: an equation involving a variable and its derivative. Specifically, it discusses a scenario where the rate of change (growth) of organisms is proportional to their current number.

The text illustrates how to derive the solution for such equations:
1. The rate of change of the population \( y \) with respect to time \( t \), denoted as \( \frac{dy}{dt} \), is directly proportional to \( y(t) \). This relationship can be expressed mathematically as \( \frac{dy}{dt} = ky \), where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.
2. Solving this differential equation involves separating variables and integrating both sides, resulting in the natural logarithm of the population being equal to \( kt + C \).
3. Exponentiating both sides gives the general solution: \( y(t) = ae^{kt} \), where \( a \) is the initial number of organisms at time \( t=0 \).

The text then applies this framework to a specific example:
- Initially, there are 100 organisms in a culture.
- After 60 minutes, the population grows to 450 organisms.

Using these conditions, it determines the constant \( k \):
1. Plug the initial condition into the equation: \( 100 = ae^{k(0)} \), confirming that \( a = 100 \).
2. Use the second condition (\( y(60) = 450 \)) to solve for \( k \): \( 4.5 = e^{60k} \). By taking natural logarithms, solve for \( k \).

Finally, it combines these findings to predict the number of organisms at any future time \( t \), resulting in the equation \( y(t) = 100e^{kt} \), with \( k \) calculated from the given data.

The text discusses how to model the growth and decay of organisms using exponential equations. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Exponential Growth**: 
   - The equation for exponential growth of organisms is given by \( N(t) = N_0 e^{kt} \), where \( N_0 \) is the initial number of organisms, \( k \) is the growth constant, and \( t \) is time in minutes.
   - Doubling time can be calculated using this model. For instance, if you start with 100 organisms and want to know when they double to 200, solve for \( t \) in \( 200 = 100 e^{kt} \).
   - The doubling time remains constant regardless of the starting number due to the nature of exponential growth.

2. **Exponential Decay**:
   - Exponential decay is modeled similarly but with a negative growth constant (\( k < 0 \)), such as in radioactive decay.
   - An example provided is carbon-14 decay, where its half-life is 5,730 years. Starting with 50 grams of carbon-14, the amount after any time \( t \) can be calculated using \( N(t) = N_0 e^{kt} \).
   - By knowing the half-life, you can determine the decay constant \( k \) and predict how much carbon-14 remains after a given period (e.g., 100 years).

The text emphasizes that while these models are idealized and not perfectly precise due to real-world variables like food availability for organisms or other environmental factors affecting decay, they provide useful approximations.

The text explains how to calculate and use the decay constant \( k \) in an exponential decay equation. Given that \( k \) equals the natural logarithm of one-half or can also be expressed as negative the natural log of 2 divided by 5730, this formula is used to derive a general equation for decay: 

\[ y = a e^{kt} \]

where \( a \) is the initial quantity (50 in this example), and \( t \) is time. With \( k \) determined as negative due to its relation with natural logs of fractions less than one, the scenario described results in exponential decay. An application example calculates how much remains after 100 days using these principles. The key takeaway is that a negative \( k \) indicates exponential decay.
