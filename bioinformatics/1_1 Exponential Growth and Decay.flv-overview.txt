This text introduces first-order differential equations and their application to modeling exponential growth or decay. It begins by defining a differential equation as an equation involving an unknown variable \( y \) and its derivative. The discussion focuses on how the rate of change of a quantity is proportional to the current amount, leading to an equation of the form:

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = ky \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

The text illustrates this concept using examples from biology, such as modeling the growth of organisms in a culture. The solution to this differential equation involves integrating both sides and applying algebraic manipulation to isolate \( y \):

\[ y = ae^{kt} \]

Here, \( a \) represents the initial quantity (e.g., number of organisms), and \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

A practical example is provided: an experiment where the growth of bacteria in a culture medium is tracked. Initially, there are 100 organisms, and after 60 minutes, the count increases to 450. Using these data points, the constant \( k \) can be determined through:

\[ 4.5 = e^{60k} \]

Taking the natural logarithm leads to finding \( k \), allowing prediction of organism growth at any time \( t \):

\[ y = 100e^{kt} \]

This demonstrates how differential equations model real-world exponential processes and provide predictions based on initial conditions.

The text discusses mathematical models for predicting the growth and decay of organisms using exponential functions. Specifically, it covers two scenarios: exponential growth of microorganisms in a culture medium and exponential decay of carbon-14 over time.

1. **Exponential Growth**:
   - The model describes how to calculate the number of organisms at any given time \( t \) (in minutes) using an equation involving the natural logarithm, expressed as \( N(t) = 100 e^{(\ln(4.5)/60)t} \).
   - It discusses determining the doubling time for these organisms by solving \( 200 = 100 e^{(\ln(4.5)/60)t} \), which simplifies to finding \( t \) when the population doubles from 100 to 200, and similarly for further doublings.
   - The constant nature of the doubling time is emphasized, regardless of the initial number of organisms.

2. **Exponential Decay**:
   - Using carbon-14 as an example, the text illustrates exponential decay with a half-life of 5,730 years.
   - Starting with 50 grams of carbon-14, the model predicts how much remains after any given time, specifically calculating it for 100 years using the equation \( y = 50 e^{kt} \).
   - It demonstrates finding the decay constant \( k \) by utilizing the known half-life to solve \( 25 = 50 e^{5730k} \), leading to calculations that determine how much carbon-14 remains after a specified period.

The text highlights the mathematical principles underlying both growth and decay processes, emphasizing their applications in fields like microbiology and radiocarbon dating.

The text discusses an equation related to exponential decay involving a constant \( k \). The value of \( k \) is calculated as:

\[ 
k = \frac{\ln(\frac{1}{2})}{5730} = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}
\]

This indicates that the process described involves exponential decay because \( k \) is negative. An example equation provided is:

\[ 
y = 50 \cdot e^{\left(-\frac{\ln(2)}{5730} \times t\right)}
\]

In this context, \( y \) represents the quantity remaining after time \( t \), starting with an initial amount of 50. For instance, if you want to find out how much remains after 100 years, you would substitute \( t = 100 \) into the equation. The negative value of \( k \) confirms that this is a decay process rather than growth.
