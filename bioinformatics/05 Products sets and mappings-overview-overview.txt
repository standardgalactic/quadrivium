The text explores product sets and mappings in set theory and algebra, highlighting several key concepts:

1. **Product Sets**: These are defined as pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x\) is from set \(A_1\) and \(y\) is from set \(A_2\). For example, if \(A_1 = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(A_2 = \{4, 5\}\), the product set includes pairs like \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 5)\).

2. **Mappings**: These involve creating pairs from two sets. For instance, in the function \(y = x^2\), real numbers on the x-axis (domain) are mapped to y-values (codomain).

3. **Domain and Codomain**:
   - The domain is the set of all possible input values, such as all real numbers for \(x\) in \(y = x^2\).
   - The codomain is the set of all potential output values.
   - The range is the actual set of outputs; for \(y = x^2\), this includes only non-negative values (\(y \geq 0\)).

4. **Types of Mappings**:
   - **Injective (One-to-One)**: Each element in the codomain has at most one pre-image in the domain.
     - Example: A mapping where each element in set \(A_3\) is mapped by at most one element from \(A_1\).
   - **Surjective (Onto)**: Every element in the codomain has at least one pre-image in the domain.
     - Example: A mapping where every element in set \(A_3\) is reached by some element from \(A_2\).
   - **Bijection**: This type of mapping is both injective and surjective, meaning each element in the codomain is mapped by exactly one element from the domain. Bijections are significant because they have inverses.

The text uses simple examples with sets labeled \(A_1\), \(A_2\), and \(A_3\) to illustrate these concepts.

The text explains key concepts in set theory and algebra, focusing on product sets and mappings:

1. **Product Sets**: These are defined as pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x\) is from one set (\(A_1\)) and \(y\) from another (\(A_2\)). For example, if \(A_1 = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(A_2 = \{4, 5\}\), the product set includes pairs like \((1, 4)\), \((1, 5)\), etc.

2. **Mappings**: This involves creating ordered pairs from two sets, such as in the function \(y = x^2\), where each real number \(x\) (domain) is paired with a corresponding \(y\)-value (codomain).

3. **Domain and Codomain**:
   - The domain is the set of all possible inputs (e.g., all real numbers for \(x\) in \(y = x^2\)).
   - The codomain is the set of potential outputs.
   - The range is the actual set of outputs, such as \(y \geq 0\) for \(y = x^2\).

4. **Types of Mappings**:
   - **Injective (One-to-One)**: Each element in the codomain has at most one pre-image in the domain.
   - **Surjective (Onto)**: Every element in the codomain is mapped by at least one element from the domain.
   - **Bijection**: A mapping that is both injective and surjective, where each element in the codomain corresponds to exactly one element from the domain. Bijections are unique because they have inverses.
