In this lecture, we explore how to perform derivatives using SymPy in Python. The process begins by setting up a notebook environment where SymPy is imported and prettyprinting is initialized for better visualization of symbolic expressions.

Key points covered include:

1. **Symbol Initialization**: Variables such as \( A \), \( B \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) are mapped to corresponding symbols using `sym.Symbol`.

2. **Defining Expressions**: An expression involving trigonometric functions is defined: \( f = \sin(XZ) + \cos(XY) \). This setup facilitates the computation of derivatives.

3. **Derivatives**:
   - **First Derivative**: The first derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( X \) is computed using `SYM.D(f, X)`. Since \( f \) contains multiple variables (\( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \)), a partial derivative is performed.
   - **Second Derivative**: The second derivative with respect to \( X \) can be obtained by either chaining the differentiation or using syntax like `X, 2`.

4. **Higher-Order Partial Derivatives**: The lecture demonstrates computing higher-order partial derivatives of an expression \( F = \sin(XY) + \cos(XZ) \) by specifying orders for each variable (e.g., once with respect to \( X \), three times with respect to \( Y \), and twice with respect to \( Z \)).

5. **Using `diff` Function**: The `diff` function is highlighted as the proper method to compute derivatives, allowing specification of variables and order directly within its parameters (e.g., `f.diff(X)` for the derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( X \)). This can be extended to compute higher-order derivatives efficiently.

This session provides a foundational understanding of symbolic differentiation using SymPy, emphasizing both basic and more complex derivative computations.
