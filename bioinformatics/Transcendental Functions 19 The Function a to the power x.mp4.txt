Now just to cement something that I just talked about briefly in the previous video
and remember that we said that any number, any constant can be expressed as e to the power
natural log of that constant. And this expands our knowledge of exponentials. So instead of
only using e to a variable power, e to the power x, if I add a power x there, I simply
add a power x there as well. So that is a different way of expressing a variable in the exponent.
Now remember this is what differentiates a polynomial from a transcendental function. In a polynomial
my variable x or y or z or whatever was in the base. Now with this form of transcendentals
my variable is in the exponent. And I need various ways to express this so that I can do
differentiation and integration on these transcendental functions.
