The text discusses three problems related to diffraction gratings and monochromatic light:

1. **Determining Lines per Centimeter on a Diffraction Grating:**
   - Using monochromatic light with a wavelength of 495 nm, the second-order maximum is observed at an angle of 9.79 degrees.
   - Applying the diffraction grating equation \( m \sin(\theta) = \frac{m \lambda}{d} \), where \( m = 2 \), allows for solving the grating spacing \( d \).
   - The calculated grating spacing is converted to lines per centimeter, resulting in approximately \( 1.72 \times 10^3 \) lines/cm.

2. **Effect of Heating on Diffraction Angle:**
   - A diffraction grating with a spacing of \( 1.25 \times 10^{-5} \) meters is heated, expanding it.
   - The thermal expansion formula \(\Delta L = \alpha L \Delta T\) is used to find the new grating spacing after heating by 100 K with an expansion coefficient of \( 1.30 \times 10^{-4} \).
   - Recalculating the diffraction angle for the 7th order maximum shows a decrease in the angle due to increased spacing from thermal expansion.

3. **Identifying Wavelengths Producing a Bright Fringe:**
   - Light ranging from 410 nm to 660 nm is used with a grating of 2850 lines per centimeter.
   - A bright fringe at 30 degrees indicates possible wavelengths using \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{m \lambda}{d} \).
   - Calculations for different orders (\( m \)) reveal that the 3rd and 4th order maxima correspond to wavelengths of approximately 585 nm and 459 nm, respectively.
   - These wavelengths fall within the given range and produce observable bright fringes.
