The text discusses an analysis of the series \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} \), known as the harmonic series. It begins by establishing that while each term in this sequence approaches zero as \( k \) increases, the convergence of the entire series is not guaranteed just because its terms approach zero.

The author explains that to determine if a series converges or diverges, we need more than knowing that the infinite term tends towards zero. A crucial step involves comparing the harmonic series with an integral. The text uses geometric intuition by representing partial sums as areas under curves and rectangles on a graph of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \).

The area beneath the curve from 1 to \( n+1 \), represented by the integral \( \int_1^{n+1} \frac{1}{x} \, dx \), provides insight into the behavior of the series. It shows that this integral (equal to \( \ln(n+1) \)) is a lower bound for the sum of the series up to \( n \). Since \( \ln(n+1) \) grows without bound as \( n \) increases, it suggests that the harmonic series itself also diverges.

In summary, while individual terms in the harmonic series approach zero, the series diverges because its partial sums grow indefinitely, a conclusion derived from comparing it to the logarithmic function through integration.

The text discusses a series \(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \ldots\) and demonstrates its divergence. It uses the integral test by comparing the sum of rectangles under the curve \(y = \frac{1}{x}\) to show that as \(n\) approaches infinity, the area (and thus the series sum) becomes infinitely large. Despite each term in the sequence tending to zero, which is inconclusive for convergence, the comparison with the natural logarithm shows that the harmonic series diverges because it consistently overestimates the area under \(\frac{1}{x}\), resulting in an infinite limit.
