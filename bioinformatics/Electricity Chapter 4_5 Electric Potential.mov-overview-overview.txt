The text explains how to calculate the electric field from electric potential using basic principles of physics. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Basic Concept**: The relationship between work done by the electric field and changes in electric potential (\(V\)) is explored. Work (\(dW\)) can be expressed as \(-Q_0 dV\) (negative charge times change in potential). Using \(dW = F \cdot ds\) and substituting \(F = Q_0 E\), we derive that \(E \cos(\theta) = -\frac{dV}{ds}\), showing the component of electric field along displacement relates to the rate of change of potential with distance.

2. **Uniform Electric Field Example**: For a uniform field, this simplifies to \(E = -\Delta V / \Delta s\). An example is given for parallel plates 1.2 cm apart, where the electric field between them is calculated as \(-833.33 \, \text{V/m}\), pointing from positive to negative plate.

3. **Non-Uniform Field Example**: For a potential \( V = 2x^2 - 3y^2 \), electric field components are derived using partial derivatives:
   - \(E_x = -4x\). At \(x = 3\) m, \(E_x = -12 \, \text{V/m}\).
   - \(E_y = +6y\). At \(y = 2\) m, \(E_y = +12 \, \text{V/m}\).

Thus, at point (3 m, 2 m), the electric field is \(-12 \hat{i} + 12 \hat{j} \, \text{V/m}\).

The text further discusses electric potential energy and its relationship with work and charge. Electric potential is defined as work done per unit charge to move a test charge from infinity to a point in space. For multiple charges, the total electric potential at any point is the sum of potentials due to each charge, considering their interactions.

An expression for the electric potential at a distance \( r \) from a point charge is given by:

\[
V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{r}
\]

where \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space. The text concludes by emphasizing vector components and algebraic signs in calculating electric fields, potentials, and work for systems of charged particles.
