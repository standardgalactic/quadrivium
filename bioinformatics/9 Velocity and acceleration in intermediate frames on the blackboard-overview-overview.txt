To understand how to calculate the acceleration of a point \( P \) in a rotating reference frame, let's break down the process into manageable steps. This involves understanding the contributions from both translational and rotational motions, particularly focusing on the effects of angular velocity (\(\omega\)) and angular acceleration (\(\alpha\)).

### Key Concepts

1. **Position Vector**: 
   - The position of point \( P \) in a rotating frame is given by \(\mathbf{r}_P = x_p \hat{i} + y_p \hat{j}\).

2. **Velocity**:
   - The velocity of \( P \) in the world frame includes contributions from both the change in coordinates and the rotation of the frame itself.
   - Differentiate the position vector with respect to time, considering the rotating unit vectors: 
     \[
     \frac{d\hat{i}}{dt} = \omega \hat{j}, \quad \frac{d\hat{j}}{dt} = -\omega \hat{i}
     \]

3. **Acceleration**:
   - Differentiate the velocity to find acceleration, incorporating both translational and rotational effects.

### Acceleration Components

1. **Translational Acceleration**:
   - The direct acceleration of \( P \) in its own frame is given by \( a_{rel} = x_p'' \hat{i} + y_p'' \hat{j} \).

2. **Rotational Effects**:
   - **Centrifugal Force**: Acts outward from the axis of rotation, given by \(-\omega^2 \mathbf{r}_P\).
   - **Coriolis Acceleration**: Arises due to motion in a rotating frame, \( 2\omega \times v_{rel} \), where \( v_{rel} \) is the velocity relative to the rotating frame.
   - **Euler Acceleration**: Due to angular acceleration, given by \(\alpha \times \mathbf{r}_P\).

### Vector Calculus Application

1. **Angular Velocity Contribution**:
   - When calculating the effect of angular velocity on velocity (\( v_P \)), use the cross product: 
     \[
     2\omega \times (x_p' \hat{i} + y_p' \hat{j})
     \]
   - This results in additional terms that account for how rotation affects perceived motion.

2. **Angular Acceleration Contribution**:
   - The effect of angular acceleration is captured by crossing \(\alpha\) with the position vector:
     \[
     \alpha \times (x_p \hat{i} + y_p \hat{j})
     \]
   - This results in terms like \( 2x \dot{\omega}_j \) and \(-2y \dot{\omega}_j\).

### Final Acceleration Equation

The total acceleration of point \( P \) in the rotating frame is a combination of all these effects:

\[ 
a = a_{rel} + 2\omega \times v_{rel} - \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_P + \alpha \times \mathbf{r}_P 
\]

### Summary

- **Relative Acceleration** (\(a_{rel}\)): The acceleration of \( P \) if the frame were not rotating.
- **Coriolis Effect**: Due to motion in a rotating frame, modifies perceived velocity.
- **Centrifugal Force**: Acts outward due to rotation.
- **Euler Effect**: Due to changes in angular velocity.

By carefully applying vector calculus and considering these components, you can derive the acceleration of a point in any rotating reference frame. This approach is crucial for understanding dynamics in non-inertial frames, such as those encountered in engineering and physics applications.
