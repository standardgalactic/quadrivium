The text outlines a method to evaluate the line integral of the function \( f(x, y) = xy \) along a line segment from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \), where the line is given by \( y = 2x + 1 \). To solve this, the curve is parameterized with respect to \( t \) such that \( x = t \) and \( y = 2t + 1 \), resulting in a vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t, 2t + 1) \).

The function \( f(x, y) \) is expressed in terms of the parameter \( t \) as:
\[ f(\mathbf{r}(t)) = t(2t + 1) = 2t^2 + t. \]

With \( x = t \), it follows that \( dx = dt \). The integral to evaluate becomes:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (2t^2 + t) \, dt.
\]

Solving the integral yields:
\[
\int (2t^2 + t) \, dt = \frac{2}{3}t^3 + \frac{1}{2}t^2,
\]
and evaluating from 0 to 1 gives:
\[
\left[\frac{2}{3}(1)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(1)^2\right] - \left[\frac{2}{3}(0)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(0)^2\right] = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{6}.
\]

Therefore, the value of the line integral is \( \frac{7}{6} \).
