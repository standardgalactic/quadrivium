The text discusses the relationship between resistivity and resistance, emphasizing how resistance depends on the dimensions of a material. It explains that resistance (R) is calculated using the formula \( R = \frac{\rho \times L}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is resistivity, \( L \) is length, and \( A \) is cross-sectional area.

An example uses an iron block with specific dimensions: a width of 1.2 cm (0.012 m), height of 0.012 m, and length of 0.15 m. The resistivity of iron is given as \( 9.68 \times 10^{-8} \) ohm meters. Depending on the block's orientation in an electrical circuit—whether the current flows through its width/height or along its length—the resistance will differ due to changes in the effective cross-sectional area and length.

The text then transitions to a problem involving a copper wire divided into two sections with different diameters (4.00R for section 1 and 2.00R for section 2). A potential difference of \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \) volts is applied over a length of 2 meters, with charge carrier density (\( N \)) given as \( 8.49 \times 10^{28} \) per cubic meter.

To find the drift velocity in section 1, the text derives an equation using current density (\( J = \frac{I}{A} \)), which relates to drift velocity (\( V_D = \frac{J}{NE} \)). By substituting \( I = \frac{V}{R} \) and using the relationship between resistance and resistivity, it arrives at an expression for drift velocity in terms of voltage, resistivity, charge carrier density, and electron charge. The drift velocities in sections 1 and 2 are related through their respective cross-sectional areas, as current remains constant across both sections.

Ultimately, the text illustrates how physical dimensions and material properties influence resistance and drift velocity in conductive materials.

The text discusses concepts related to electrical circuits, specifically focusing on current density, drift velocity, current distribution in parallel wires, and calculating potential differences.

1. **Current Density and Drift Velocity:**
   - The current density is higher when the radius of the wire changes, but the actual current remains constant.
   - Using the ratio of resistances (\(R_1\) and \(R_2\)), where \(R_1 = 2R_2\), it's shown that drift velocity in a wire with radius \(R_1\) is four times that of radius \(R_2\). 
   - The calculated drift velocity for the smaller radius (\(R_2\)) is approximately \(5.44 \times 10^{-9}\) meters per second.

2. **Current Distribution in Parallel Wires:**
   - A cable with 125 strands, each having a resistance of \(2.65 \times 10^{-6} \Omega\), carries a total current of 0.7575 A.
   - The current through each strand is calculated by dividing the total current by the number of strands, resulting in approximately \(6.00 \times 10^{-3}\) A per strand.

3. **Potential Difference Across Parallel Wires:**
   - To find the potential difference across the entire cable system, use Ohm's law (\(V = I_{\text{total}} \times R_{\text{total}}\)).
   - The total resistance for wires in parallel is calculated using \(1/R_{\text{total}} = 125 / (2.65 \times 10^{-6} \Omega)\), resulting in a total resistance of approximately \(21.2\) nΩ.
   - The potential difference across the system is then found to be about \(15.9\) nV.

The text illustrates how changing dimensions and configurations within an electrical circuit affect current density, drift velocity, and overall resistance, emphasizing that while individual wire properties change, total current remains constant in parallel systems.
