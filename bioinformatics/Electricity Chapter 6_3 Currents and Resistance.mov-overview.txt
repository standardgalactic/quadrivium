The text discusses the relationship between resistivity and resistance, emphasizing how resistance depends on the dimensions of a material. It explains that resistance (R) is calculated using the formula \( R = \frac{\rho \times L}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is resistivity, \( L \) is length, and \( A \) is cross-sectional area.

An example uses an iron block with specific dimensions: a width of 1.2 cm (0.012 m), height of 0.012 m, and length of 0.15 m. The resistivity of iron is given as \( 9.68 \times 10^{-8} \) ohm meters. Depending on the block's orientation in an electrical circuit—whether the current flows through its width/height or along its length—the resistance will differ due to changes in the effective cross-sectional area and length.

The text then transitions to a problem involving a copper wire divided into two sections with different diameters (4.00R for section 1 and 2.00R for section 2). A potential difference of \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \) volts is applied over a length of 2 meters, with charge carrier density (\( N \)) given as \( 8.49 \times 10^{28} \) per cubic meter.

To find the drift velocity in section 1, the text derives an equation using current density (\( J = \frac{I}{A} \)), which relates to drift velocity (\( V_D = \frac{J}{NE} \)). By substituting \( I = \frac{V}{R} \) and using the relationship between resistance and resistivity, it arrives at an expression for drift velocity in terms of voltage, resistivity, charge carrier density, and electron charge. The drift velocities in sections 1 and 2 are related through their respective cross-sectional areas, as current remains constant across both sections.

Ultimately, the text illustrates how physical dimensions and material properties influence resistance and drift velocity in conductive materials.

The text discusses concepts related to electrical circuits, specifically focusing on current density, drift velocity, current distribution in parallel wires, and calculating potential differences.

1. **Current Density and Drift Velocity:**
   - The current density is higher when the radius of the wire changes, but the actual current remains constant.
   - Using the ratio of resistances (\(R_1\) and \(R_2\)), where \(R_1 = 2R_2\), it's shown that drift velocity in a wire with radius \(R_1\) is four times that of radius \(R_2\). 
   - The calculated drift velocity for the smaller radius (\(R_2\)) is approximately \(5.44 \times 10^{-9}\) meters per second.

2. **Current Distribution in Parallel Wires:**
   - A cable with 125 strands, each having a resistance of \(2.65 \times 10^{-6} \Omega\), carries a total current of 0.7575 A.
   - The current through each strand is calculated by dividing the total current by the number of strands, resulting in approximately \(6.00 \times 10^{-3}\) A per strand.

3. **Potential Difference Across Parallel Wires:**
   - To find the potential difference across the entire cable system, use Ohm's law (\(V = I_{\text{total}} \times R_{\text{total}}\)).
   - The total resistance for wires in parallel is calculated using \(1/R_{\text{total}} = 125 / (2.65 \times 10^{-6} \Omega)\), resulting in a total resistance of approximately \(21.2\) nΩ.
   - The potential difference across the system is then found to be about \(15.9\) nV.

The text illustrates how changing dimensions and configurations within an electrical circuit affect current density, drift velocity, and overall resistance, emphasizing that while individual wire properties change, total current remains constant in parallel systems.

The text explores the relationship between resistivity and resistance by applying it to an iron block with given dimensions and resistivity. It discusses how the orientation of the block affects its resistance when used as a resistor in an electrical circuit, due to different areas of contact.

In a practical problem involving a copper wire divided into two sections (with differing diameters), the text seeks to calculate drift velocity. The key points are:

1. **Resistivity and Resistance**: Resistance (\(R\)) is calculated using resistivity (\(\rho\)), length (\(L\)), and cross-sectional area (\(A\)): \(R = \frac{\rho L}{A}\).

2. **Drift Velocity Calculation**:
   - The drift velocity (\(V_D\)) equation used is \(V_D = \frac{J}{nE} = \frac{I}{nEA}\).
   - Given parameters include the resistivity of copper, the number density of charge carriers (\(N\)), and potential difference.

3. **Wire Sections**:
   - Section 1 has a diameter of \(4R\) and section 2 has \(2R\).
   - Despite different diameters, current remains constant across sections due to continuity.
   - Drift velocity is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area; thus, drift velocity in section 1 (\(V_{D1}\)) will be less than in section 2 (\(V_{D2}\)), since \(A_1 > A_2\).

The problem emphasizes understanding how material properties and geometric configurations influence electrical characteristics like resistance and current flow.

The text discusses concepts related to electric current density, drift velocity, and electrical circuits involving multiple strands of wire.

1. **Current Density and Drift Velocity:**
   - It explains that while the current density is higher in one section compared to another, the actual current remains constant through both sections.
   - By comparing resistances \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), where \( R_1 = 2R_2 \), it derives the relationship between drift velocities. Specifically, the drift velocity in section 1 is one-fourth of that in section 2 (\( v_d1 = \frac{1}{4}v_d2 \)).
   - This results in a drift velocity for section 1 calculated as approximately \( 5.44 \times 10^{-9} \) meters per second.

2. **Cable with Multiple Strands:**
   - A cable consists of 125 strands, each having a resistance of \( 2.65 \times 10^{-6} \) ohms.
   - The total current through the cable is 0.7575 amperes.
   - **Current in Each Strand:** Since there are 125 identical strands, the current per strand is calculated by dividing the total current by the number of strands: \( I_{\text{strand}} = \frac{0.7575}{125} = 6.00 \times 10^{-3} \) amperes.
   - **Potential Difference Across the System:** 
     - The strands are connected in parallel, so the total resistance \( R_T \) can be calculated using the formula for parallel resistances: 
       \[
       \frac{1}{R_T} = \sum_{i=1}^{125} \frac{1}{R_i} = \frac{125}{2.65 \times 10^{-6}}
       \]
     - Solving gives \( R_T \approx 21.2 \) nanohms.
   - Using Ohm's Law (\( V = I \times R \)), the potential difference across the system is:
     \[
     V = 0.7575 \, \text{A} \times 21.2 \times 10^{-9} \, \Omega \approx 1.60 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{V}
     \]
   - This results in a potential difference of approximately \( 16 \) nanovolts.

Overall, the text illustrates how current and voltage distribute across different sections and strands within an electrical system while emphasizing the relationships between resistance, drift velocity, and current density.
