In this problem we are asked to solve for the complex number z
and we are given that 4 minus 3i times the complex conjugate of z equals i
It's easy enough to solve inasmuch as it's going to be i divided by 4 minus 3i
which is going to be i times 4 plus 3i
divided by 4 squared is 16 plus and 9 is 25
that is going to be 4i plus 3i squared divided by 25
that is going to be negative 3 plus 4i divided by 25
which is negative 3 over 25 plus 4 over 25i
but that is the complex conjugate of z
we need just the complex number itself
so that will be negative 3 over 25
and it will be a minus 4 over 25i
let's do this problem
probably nothing in the preceding chapter in the textbook
when you get to the problems after the chapter
will prepare you for this sort of thing
but let's see if we can figure it out nonetheless
graph
this absolute value of z plus i must be less than or equal to 1
and you have to graph that out of a complex coordinate system
matching with axis
real axis
how to graph this
well
let's rewrite this
z is a plus bi
plus another i must be less than or equal to 1
so we have here a plus
b plus 1
1 plus bi
z is there
now this indicate to you that we are doing the modulus
the modulus of a complex number
and the modulus of a complex number
which is now there
the modulus of a complex number
of a complex number
equals
the square root of a squared
plus b squared
so
what am I saying here
I'm saying
we are taking the square root of a squared
plus b plus 1 squared
and that must be
less than or equal to 1
and just think about the normal Cartesian coordinate system
if I had the square root of x squared plus y
squared
equals 1
what would I have on the normal Cartesian coordinate system
I would have a circle
and the circle would have a radius of 1
circle would have a radius of 1
if I added a plus 1 there
so the square root of x squared plus y plus 1 squared
equals 1
what does that plus 1 do?
it drops the y axis by 1
so that was 1
that was 1
that was negative 1
that was 1
what we're now going to have is this
we've just dropped that center by 1
the center is now at negative 1
so that's 0
that's still 1
that's still negative 1
and this is minus 2
and this is exactly what is happening here
and this is exactly what is happening here
but now we have less than or equal to
so it's not just a circle
but less than 1
so it will be all of this
so what we're going to have here
is the following
and that would be
it will be negative i
ok and then this here will be 1
this here will be negative 1
and this here will be minus 2i
and all of this colored in because it's less than
all of that colored in because it's less than
so not so difficult
even though your textbook might not exactly explain to you
what is going on there
it's not that difficult
if you just think about normal graph in algebra
ok let's graph this
the modulus of z is less than 2 or greater than 1
so what are we suggesting here
we're suggesting that the modulus of the square root of a squared
well let's make
let's start with that
it's a plus b i
must be less than 2
in other words 1 is less than the square root of a squared plus b squared
it's less than 2
so if we just thought
think about what would that have been
if it's x squared plus y squared
and it's equal to 2
and it's equal to 2
so that just means that that's 1, that's 2
that's 1, that's 2
that's 1, that's 2
negative 1, negative 2
so negative 1, negative 2
negative 1, negative 2
1, 2, 1, 2
it would have been this circle through 2
and if this was equal to 1
then it would have been the circle with the radius of 1
centered on the origin
because nothing's happening there
ok but it's got to be less than 2
or greater than 1
so it's actually all of this
and it's not equal to
so this should actually be
a dotted line
and a dotted line
because those values of vector radii are not included
but let's do this one
the modulus of 2 times z minus 4i must be less than 1
I have to graph that
what I'm saying the modulus is
if I see this complex number
as a vector in R2 space
I want the radius to be less than 1
I think there is a common fact here of 2
and since that is the 2 is a constant
it's an absolute value
we can take that out
z minus 2i
is less than 1
in other words
it's less than 1 half
you can divide both sides by 2
z is a plus bi
minus 2i
it's got to be less than 1 half
so I have here the modulus of a plus b minus 2i
it's less than 1 half
so the length of this must be less than 1 half
so I have here the square root
this modulus is the square root of a squared
plus b minus 2 squared
less than 1
what does that tell us?
it tells us the rate of half
sorry
if I look at my complex coordinate system
so I think in the first one I called this negative 1
actually 1
it's 1i
2i
this would be negative 1i
I think in the previous one I forgot to put the i's there
so that'll be 1
that'll be 2
that'll be negative 1
that'll be negative 2
okay
minus 2 means I'm taking the center up by 2
and the radius is going to be less than 1 half
so it'll be
1 half radius
oh I think that was a bit too far
that's an oval
okay
and inside
and inside
with a radius of only in half
and it's less than
so it's only inside
here we go with perhaps the easiest one
I want the modulus of z to be less than
the modulus of z plus i
so what am I asking
the modulus of z is this a squared plus b squared
must be less than
yeah
and the modulus of a plus b
i plus i
so that equals
the modulus of a plus
it's a b plus 1
i
in other words
the square root of a squared plus b squared
must be less than
the square root of a squared
plus b plus 1 squared
I can square both sides
so I have a squared plus b squared
it's less than a squared plus
what do we have here
we have b squared
plus 2b
plus 1
I can subtract this from that side
so I lose those
I lose those
so what do I have
I have 0 is less than
2b
plus 1
in other words
2b is greater than negative 1
or b is greater than negative 1 half
and remember b
b is my imaginary axis
so b is just going to be greater than
so negative 1 half
so if this is negative 1 half
i
it's everything
above that line
everything above that line
a lot easier than perhaps it looks there
let's do this rather easy problem
I'm given two complex numbers
z1 and z2
such that z2 does not equal 0
and I need to calculate the real and imaginary parts
of z1 divided by z2
so I can't just say
x1 divided by x2
and that's the real parts of z1 and z2
I can't do that
I have to do the whole thing
so it's going to be
z1 over z2
equals
I'm going to have
x1 plus i
y1
and I'm going to multiply that
by the complex conjugate of z2
so this is going to be x2
minus i
y2
and I'm going to divide that
by the square
of the modulus
of z2
so I remember my equation
for division of complex numbers
which means
it's going to be an x squared
x2 squared
plus y2 squared
all I need to do
is simplify my numerator there
so I'm going to have
x1 x2
x1 x2
I'm going to have
minus
x1 y2 i
I'm going to have
a positive
x2 y1 i
and I'm going to have
a negative
y1 y2
i squared
which will make it
negative 1
that will mean
a positive
y1 y2
all divided by
my x2 squared
plus y2 squared
that's rather simple
to
simplify
in as much as
I have
x1
x1 x2
plus y1 y2
on that side
and so that will be
divided by
x2 squared
plus y2 squared
which immediately becomes
my real part
of z1
divided by z2
and I can have
on the side
plus
we can make it
x2 y1
minus
x1 y2
i
divided by
okay apologies
for that
I see the card
memory card
was full
once again
I think
somewhere here
I was just writing
them as
x2 squared
plus y2
squared
so that's my
common denominator
for both
and I've just
taken my real
part
and my imaginary
part
I've taken out
i
that's very ugly
there
x2
I've taken i
out as a
common factor
there
and just wrote
x2 y1
minus x1
y2
so this is
not the end
of the problem
this is what
you were asked
so please write
it independently
real of z1
over z2
equals this
and imaginary
of z1 over z2
equals this part
not with the i
ok so you see
it was more
difficult than
it's not just
x1 over x2
it's not just
the real part
divided by the real
part
you have to do
the full
division of the
complex numbers
and it's easy
then just to
separate the two
each with their
own
each on their
own
common denominator
hundred
populations
