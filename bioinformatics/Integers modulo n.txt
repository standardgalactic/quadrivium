Today we're going to look at a very interesting group. It's the integers mod n.
Don't run away. I'm going to make it very simple. I'm going to oversimplify it.
You're going to actually be bored when you see how simple this is.
The integers, integers mod n.
Under certain circumstances, the integers mod n under addition,
we're going to show that that is indeed a group.
What I want to start you off with is just a very basic reminder of your days at school
and that's how to do division.
And I'm going to start off very easy. I'm going to say 4 divided by 4.
And what I'm really interested in here is what the remainder is.
If I do that, what is 4 divided by 4?
Well, 4 goes into 4 exactly once.
And 1 times 4 is 4 and there's a remainder of 0.
Why? Because we write it like this.
1 times 4 plus 0. That's our remainder.
That's 4 plus 0 is 4.
What if I were to divide 5 by 4?
Well, that's still going to be 1 times 4 but I have a remainder of 1
because 1 times 4 is 4 plus 1 equals 5.
So here I had a remainder of 0. Here I have a remainder of 1.
What about 6 divided by 4? Well, that's going to have a remainder of 2.
7 divided by 4 is going to have a remainder of 3.
8 divided by 4 is going to jump to 0 again.
So it seems that there's going to be this little repetition.
So that's very easy.
What about these fractions?
3 divided by 4.
Well, what we do there is we say it's 0 times 4 plus a remainder of 3.
0 times 4.
So 3 divided by 4 is 0 with a remainder of 3.
So 0 plus 3 and that indeed is the 3 that I'm looking for.
So the remainder here is 3.
2 divided by 4, we know it's a half, but it's actually 0 times 4 with a remainder of 2.
0 plus 2, that's 2.
So our remainder here is 2.
1 over 4, we have a remainder of 1.
0 divided by 4 is 0 times 4 plus a remainder of 0.
That equals 0.
So a remainder here is 0.
So it seems we do have the 0, 1, 2, 3.
0, 1, 2, 3.
0, 1, 2, 3.
0, 1, 2, 3.
It seems like these are the only 4 remainders I'm going to have when I divide by 4.
Now let's just get to the difficult ones.
So that was very basic.
What about the negative one?
What would be the remainder there?
Well, if I look at it, it seems to be that the remainder has got to be 3
because I'm going 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0.
It better be a 3 on this side.
And indeed it is because what we have here, we overshoot to the left hand side.
So it's minus 1 times 4.
That gives me minus 4.
But I need to get to minus 1.
So I better add 3.
So if I divide negative 1 by 4, minus 1 divided by 4, the remainder is 3.
Because it goes into 4, goes into negative 1, minus 1 time, and there's a remainder of 3.
Minus 2, we would know it as negative 1 half, but it's actually negative 1 times 4.
It goes into that negative 1 times.
So I'm overshooting to negative 4.
But to get back to negative 2, I have to add another 2.
That's going to give me my negative 3 that I'm looking for.
That's going to give me my negative 2 that I'm looking for.
Negative 3 divided by 4.
Well, that's still negative 1 times 4.
Plus my remainder is now 1 to get to negative 3.
So my remainder here is going to be 2.
My remainder here is going to be 1.
And negative 4 divided by 4.
As you imagined, my remainder there is 0.
So that is very simply how to look at the remainder.
Remember here that it is 0 times for these.
And here I overshoot to the left hand side.
And I have to add because my remainders must always be positive.
So that's the first part.
Let's clean the board and move on to the second part in our journey into the integers mod n.
So the board is clean.
What I've left on the board for you here is the remainders.
Remember that I would get to the 3 here because it would be 4 times negative.
It would be 4 times negative 3.
That's negative 12.
And I had to add a positive 3 to get to negative 9.
The next thing I want to talk about is relations.
Remember relations?
If you don't, I'll link to it in the top corner there.
You can click on that to watch the video on relations, I should say.
So I'm going to have a few things.
I'm going to have a set S.
And I'm going to let that set equals the set of all integers.
I'm going to choose an n and that's going to be an element of the integers minus 0.
I don't want 0 because I'm trying to divide by and I can't divide by 0.
So I'm going to choose an n there to divide all my integers.
And then I'm going to have this relation R.
Remember sometimes related like that.
And my relation is going to be the following.
n divides a minus b for all a comma b elements of the integers or elements of my set S.
Now what does this n divides mean?
It means you divide by n and there's a remainder of 0.
Then it does divide.
So if I have 4 divides 12.
That is indeed correct.
Because 12 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 0.
So 4 does indeed divide 12.
4 does not divide 11.
So you can't write that.
And a minus b is just something like I have 12 minus 8.
And that is 4 divides 4 which is just 4 divided by 4.
And that's just 1 with the remainder.
The remainder is important.
Our remainder here is 0.
So that would be my a and that would be my b.
That's what it means.
So n divides a minus b for all that.
This means I should actually write this as well.
A minus b for all a.
So let's just correct that.
Let's just make that very clear that it's a minus b that we have there.
So n divides a minus b.
There's your example there.
So this is my relation that I'm interested in.
Now remember that we had 3 properties.
And if those 3 properties held for my relation.
It is going to be a very special kind of relation.
Remember that.
The first one was the reflexive property.
Let's quickly look at that.
Reflexive.
And that would state the following.
If this is reflexive what we would have is that n divides a minus a for all a elements of my set s.
Or in this instance the integers.
And is that true?
Well a minus a for all a is 0.
And n does indeed divide 0.
Because 0 divided by 1 is 0.
0 divided by 2.
Remember my n is any integer except 0.
So 0 divided by a million is still 0.
With a remainder of 0.
So it does divide 0.
So we do have that our relation here that we set up.
Our relation that we set up does divide a minus a for all a elements of s.
So it is reflexive.
Is it symmetric?
Is it symmetric?
The symmetric property is going to say that n divides a minus b implies that n also divides b minus a.
Is that true?
And it's actually got to be true both ways.
Well is that so?
Remember though that a minus b that's just equal to minus b minus a.
That's exactly the same thing.
And it's not a proof but think of it.
If 4 divides 8 it's also going to divide negative 8.
The remainder is going to be 0 in both instances.
But let's say that as far as if you do want to get to a proof let's say that a minus b equals
let's say some r and that r can be written as n times p.
If n does divide that it is a multiple of n.
Can you see that?
If n divides r so if I could write this n divides r and r can then be written as n divides p.
So if 4 divides 8 it is going to divide 2 times 4.
So let's do that.
If 4 divides 8 it can be written as 4 times 2.
And you can see that.
So 8 in this instance is going to be my r.
And this is going to be my np there.
And r equals np.
And if I can write if anything is a multiple of 4.
Of course it is going to divide.
4 is going to divide any multiple of 4.
4 times 3, 4 times 4, 4 times 5, 4 times 6, 4 times 0, 4 times negative 2.
It is always going to divide.
It is always going to divide that.
And if this is equal to negative.
Is equal to the negative of b minus a.
Or let's put it this way.
Let's write it in a different way.
That what we wanted to say here.
If we do this.
Then this is going to be negative r.
So this is going to be n times negative p.
So for instance that it would be 4 divides 4 times negative 2.
So we have that it divides both of them.
The p and the negative p.
Because both of them will be multiples of 4 in that instance.
So that does go both ways.
There is this symmetric property involved here.
So we do have that this is.
It is reflexive.
It is symmetric.
Let's look to see if it's transitive.
Now think about it this way.
If 4 divides.
If 4 divides 8.
And 4 divides 4.
4 is definitely going to divide 8 plus 4.
And this 8 might have been 12 minus 4.
It might have been 8 minus 4.
So I have.
Or let's say.
Well that's not the proper example.
But I really want to show you.
Let's do it this way.
If n divides a minus b.
It implies that.
And.
Let's do and.
n divides b minus c.
That implies that.
n divides.
A minus c.
Now let's think about it this way.
That's.
The example that I have here.
So let's make.
Let's do those.
Let's make that.
12 minus.
Minus.
8.
And.
8 minus 4.
So there's my a and my b.
That's my b.
And that's my c.
So.
What about if I add those two together.
Of course you see that these are going to cancel.
And 12 minus 4.
Is going to give me 8.
And 4.
And d does divide 8.
So you can see.
So you can see where this is going.
That if I have those two.
And I add them.
This means this occurs.
Because what I have there is.
A minus b.
Plus.
B minus c.
Those two cancel.
And it's a minus.
And it's a minus c.
We can also look at it in a different way.
Well let me clean the board.
And I'll show you.
So.
Let me show you.
With a clean board now.
What I'm saying is.
N divides.
P times n.
And n divides.
Q times n.
If it does.
Do this.
If it does.
Do this.
This is just.
A minus b.
And this one is.
B minus c.
I can write them both.
As that.
Because remember.
If it does divide.
It is a multiple.
Of n.
Now if I add.
These two up.
These two up.
Together with each other.
So that's going to be.
P n.
Plus q n.
I'm going to take.
An n out.
And that is.
P plus q.
So that was my.
And that was.
Q.
So imagine.
This.
A minus b.
Is p.
B minus c.
Is q.
Multiple of n.
I am going to have.
This multiple of n.
So if I add those.
I take n out.
And indeed.
N is going to.
Divide those two.
So we do have.
The transitive property.
As well.
And if we do have.
A relation that has.
The reflexive property.
The symmetric property.
And the transitive property.
It is going to divide.
Our set here.
It is going to divide.
Our set.
And we are going to have this.
This is called.
An equivalence relation.
Remember.
Equivalence relation.
And we're going to have.
Equivalence classes.
Equivalence.
Classes.
And if I do have.
These equivalence classes.
They are going to have.
An intersection.
Which is the.
Empty set.
And now.
Just look at this.
Very beautifully here.
If I look at.
The integers.
Mod 4.
Because I'm dividing.
By 4.
I do seem to have.
These.
Equivalence classes.
Let's write them out.
That was my relation.
I've done exactly that.
Let me show you.
That this is indeed.
An equivalence class.
The first one.
Is going to be.
Zero.
My first.
Equivalence class.
Remember.
That's how.
Some textbooks.
Write it.
Some have.
A line underneath.
And let's see.
Everything.
That has.
A remainder.
Of zero.
We start there.
Say.
With.
Minus 12.
Minus 8.
Minus 4.
Zero.
Four.
Eight.
Twelve.
Zero.
Let's have a look.
At the ones.
That have a remainder.
One.
And we see them.
We see them here.
Minus 7.
Let's do.
Minus 10.
As well.
So minus.
Should that be.
Minus 10.
Three.
Zero.
Three.
Two.
One.
Minus 7.
Plus 4.
Minus 11.
Minus 7.
Minus 3.
Two.
Five.
Nine.
Thirteen.
And if you see.
If I look at those two.
They have nothing.
The intersection.
Would be the empty set.
Let's look at those.
With a remainder.
Of twelve.
With a remainder.
Of two.
I should say.
A remainder.
Two.
There.
Is my negative.
Six.
Minus 6.
Minus 2.
Two.
Six.
Ten.
Fourteen.
And so on.
And so on.
And three.
With a remainder.
Of three.
There we go.
Let's do.
Minus nine.
So minus nine.
And with another.
Three.
Is going to be.
Minus five.
Minus one.
We're going to have a three.
We're going to have a seven.
We're going to have an eleven.
We're going to have a fifteen.
Etc.
So they are my equivalence classes.
They are going to be equivalence classes.
Because I've shown that this relation.
It has a reflexive property.
A symmetric property.
And a transitive property.
Because look at this.
If I say.
Eight.
Minus four.
That gives me four.
And four.
Does indeed divide four.
So my relation holds.
Nine.
Divide by five.
Is four.
Fourteen.
Minus six.
Is eight.
And four.
Does divide eight.
Eleven.
Minus seven.
Is four.
And four.
Divides four.
So any.
And these.
Any a minus b.
That I do here.
Is going to have a remainder of zero.
Relation is going to hold for all of those.
For all of those.
For all of those.
For all of those.
For all of those.
So I do have.
That this.
Does give me.
Equivalence classes.
And then you can see the equivalence class.
And no matter what two values you select.
In any of these equivalence classes.
If I subtract two of them.
It is going to be divisible by four.
And now.
These.
Is the set that I'm interested in.
When it comes to the integers.
Mod four.
For instance.
And this.
So anytime I choose a different integer.
N.
Just not zero.
I'm going to get the following.
The integers.
That I am going to get the following.
So for.
N equals four.
My new set.
Let's call this my set A.
That is going to be.
Zero.
One.
The equivalence classes.
So in this instance.
I'm going to have three.
Up to three.
So I'm going to have four equivalence classes.
Because N was four.
I'm going to have four equivalence classes.
And that is these things.
This is my new set.
And I'm going to do arithmetic.
On these four elements.
And if I do.
If my.
If my binary operation.
Say for instance.
Is addition.
I'm going to look at.
Is the addition.
This is my set.
It only has four elements.
In this case.
If I were divided by 12.
I would have 12 elements.
But.
Let's just stick to these four.
Do they form a group.
Under addition.
So I've got a set of four elements.
I want to know.
Are they a group.
Under addition.
Let's have a look.
So the border scheme.
Let's carry on.
I've got my equivalence classes here.
Zero.
One.
Two.
Three.
I'm going to select.
Any two of these.
And it will be.
Divisible by four.
So I've got my new set.
S.
It only has four elements.
My binary operation.
Is addition.
So my group.
I'm claiming.
Is.
This group.
S.
Under the.
Operator.
Binary operation.
Of addition.
That is my group.
Let's see.
If this is indeed.
A group.
The way.
That we are going.
To define.
Addition.
Addition.
If I take.
Any one of these.
Let's call these.
S sub one.
S sub two.
S sub three.
And.
S sub four.
Any one of these two.
And I'm going to define.
The addition.
Of any two of these.
Say.
Si.
Plus.
And.
I can be equal to J.
Or.
Cannot be equal to J.
So I can say.
S one.
Plus.
S one.
Which will be.
Zero.
Plus.
Zero.
I'm going to define that.
By taking.
A representative.
Element.
Of.
S.
Inside.
Of that.
And I'm going to take.
Any one.
In this.
Equivalence.
Class.
So maybe.
I'll take.
Four.
I'm going to add.
To that.
Any one.
In one.
Let's take one.
That is going to equal.
Five.
And five.
Is in what.
Equivalence.
Class.
Well five.
Is an equivalence.
Class one.
So I'm going to say.
Zero.
Plus one.
Is one.
I'm only talking about.
Addition.
Of these.
Four elements.
But the way.
I define.
Addition.
Is by taking.
A representative.
In that.
Equivalence.
Of these.
Tables.
So I'm going to have.
Here.
Zero.
I'm going to have.
One.
I'm going to have.
Two.
And I'm going to have.
Three.
And to that.
I'm going to add.
One.
I'm going to add.
Two.
Three.
And four.
Let's have that.
And let's do.
This.
And let's do.
That.
So all I'm going to do.
What.
What.
What have I done?
That was very funny.
One.
Two.
And three.
Anyway.
There we go.
It's been a busy day.
So let's do.
Zero.
Plus zero.
And.
Just keep it easy for yourself.
Zero.
Plus zero.
Zero.
And.
And four.
Divides into that.
With a remainder of zero.
So this is going to remain.
I'm not going to put the.
Square brackets around.
So that remains in zero.
Any two that I add there.
Four.
Plus eight.
Is twelve.
Is in that.
Equivalence class.
If I take.
A representative.
Of one.
And added to zero.
So let's take one.
Plus zero.
That's one.
One is still.
In that class.
So it stays in one.
And you can.
Very quickly see.
If I add.
Zero.
To any of these.
Or if I add.
Any of these.
To zero.
That remains.
In that same class.
So what we can.
Very quickly see.
It seems though.
Well it is.
Zero.
Is our.
Identity element.
So we already know.
That we do have.
An identity element.
Here.
Because.
Zero.
Plus anyone.
So this one.
Plus any of the others.
Or any of the others.
Plus zero.
Gives me.
The identity element.
Let's take.
One.
Plus one.
So if I take.
Any element in one.
And I add it to one.
So let's just stick to one.
One plus one is two.
And that's in the equivalence.
Class two.
So one plus one.
Is going to give me.
A two there.
Let's do.
Two.
Plus one.
So I'm going to take.
One from two.
Let's take two.
Plus one is three.
And I seem to end up.
In equivalence class.
Three.
So I end up.
In equivalence class.
So.
Three.
Let's take.
Three.
Plus one.
So let's take.
Three.
Just to keep it simple.
Plus one is four.
And that's in equivalence class.
Zero.
So that's in equivalence class.
Zero.
Let's take a one.
Plus a two.
So let's.
Here.
Be.
Let's take.
We're doing a one.
Plus a two.
So let's take.
Five and six.
Well that's eleven.
And eleven.
Is in class three.
Eleven is in class three.
Let's take a two and a two.
Two and two is four.
I jump back to zero.
And let's take three plus two.
Three plus two is five.
I'm just taking.
Or seven and six is thirteen.
Or six and negative one is five.
Whatever I do.
I'll end up in equivalence class one.
Let's take one plus three.
One plus three is four.
Four is in equivalence class zero.
A two plus a three.
So let's take.
Any one here.
Let's take negative two.
And three.
And three.
That gives us one.
And one is in equivalence class one.
And let's take a three and a three again.
So let's take.
Three and seven is ten.
And that's in equivalence class two.
So what do I see here?
I see that.
By the way that I've defined addition.
On these four elements.
I find the following.
It is closed under addition.
Closed under addition.
No matter what two.
Closed under addition.
The binary operation of addition.
No matter what two I add.
What two of these I add to each other.
I still remain inside of one of these.
So it is closed.
Now is it associative?
You can check on that.
I'm not going to do a proof of that.
But check on it.
Just take some elements.
And you are definitely going to see.
That I have.
If I have.
Si.
Plus.
Sj.
Plus.
Sj.
Plus.
Sk.
If I do that.
So the associative property.
Is indeed going to hold.
We've already seen.
That there is an identity element.
And that is.
The zero one.
Is there an inverse.
For each and every one.
An inverse means.
If I add anyone.
To anyone.
I get back.
To the identity element.
Zero.
So zero.
Is it's own.
Inverse.
Because if I add.
Zero.
To zero.
I get back.
To the identity element.
Zero.
So zero.
Is it's own.
Inverse.
Because if I add.
Zero.
To zero.
I get back.
To the identity element.
Let's check.
Let's see.
If.
If I add.
Anything to one.
If I get.
To the identity element.
And it seems.
There's three.
So three.
Is the inverse.
Of one.
Two.
Is it's own.
Inverse.
And the inverse.
Of three.
Is one.
So every element.
Has.
It's inverse.
Inside of the set.
Lo and behold.
I have.
A group.
That the.
Integers.
Mod.
In.
In this instance.
It was four.
Under addition.
Does form.
A group.
And.
For those elements.
Under addition.
To.
I want you.
To try.
Multiplication.
So if.
We were.
To change.
This.
To multiplication.
Let's.
Do that.
Quickly.
We change.
That.
To multiplication.
Is the.
Integers.
Mod.
Four.
Or.
Mod.
Anything.
Then.
In.
In.
In.
In.
In.
In.
In.
In.
In.
There.
Two.
Two.
in that class. So just go through that, see that you can do it on your own and see which
of these properties hold. But you are going to see that under multiplication these are
not a group. Under addition, integers mod n form a beautiful group.
