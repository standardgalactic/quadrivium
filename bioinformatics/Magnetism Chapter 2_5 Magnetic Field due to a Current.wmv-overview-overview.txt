The text explains how to find the magnetic field inside a uniformly current-carrying wire using Ampere's Law. It describes selecting a circular Amperian surface within the wire to simplify calculations of the enclosed current, which is proportional to the area ratio between this circle and the wire’s total cross-sectional area.

The derived formula for the magnetic field \( B \) inside the wire is:

\[ B = \frac{\mu_0 i r}{2\pi R^2} \]

Here, \( \mu_0 \) represents the permeability of free space, \( i \) is the total current through the wire, \( r \) is the radial distance from the center of the wire, and \( R \) is the radius of the wire. The magnetic field increases linearly with \( r \), starting at zero at the center and reaching a maximum at the wire's surface.

The concept of an Amperian (or empyrean) surface—a loop used for applying Ampere’s Law—is introduced, highlighting how it encloses current based on its placement within the wire.
