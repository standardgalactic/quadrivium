And here we have Microsoft Excel, the Windows version 2013. At the top you will notice all
the tabs and under the data tab on the ribbon on the right hand side you would notice data
analysis. Now if you have a lot of data filled in and you hit the data analysis button here
a lot of statistical tools will appear from which you can choose. Now this is not installed by default.
You have to go all the way to file and on the left hand side to options. Under options you'll
note add-ins. Once you clicked on add-ins right at the bottom it says manage Excel add-ins and hit go.
Now there we are this will be unchecked you have to check that. The solver add-in is also quite good
but definitely you need the analysis tool pack. You'll hit OK. I'll hit cancel. It's already installed
and then you will see the data analysis tool pack on the right hand side of the ribbon under the data tab.
