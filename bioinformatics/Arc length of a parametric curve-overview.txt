It looks like you are explaining how to find the arc length of a curve parameterized by \( t \) using calculus, specifically employing the Mean Value Theorem and properties of small increments. Let's summarize and complete your explanation:

To determine the arc length of a curve given by parametric equations \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), we consider the curve over an interval \([a, b]\). The idea is to divide this interval into smaller sub-intervals, calculate the approximate linear distance for each segment, and then sum these distances.

1. **Divide the Interval**: Divide the interval \([a, b]\) into \( n \) equal parts with points \( t_0 = a, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n = b\). Each sub-interval has a length of \(\Delta t = \frac{b-a}{n}\).

2. **Approximate Segment Length**: For each segment from \( t_{i-1} \) to \( t_i \), approximate the curve by a straight line segment connecting the points \((x(t_{i-1}), y(t_{i-1}))\) and \((x(t_i), y(t_i))\). The length of this line segment, denoted as \( s_i \), can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   s_i \approx \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2}
   \]

3. **Use Mean Value Theorem**: According to the Mean Value Theorem, there exist points \( c_i \in [t_{i-1}, t_i] \) and \( d_i \in [t_{i-1}, t_i] \) such that:
   \[
   x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}) = x'(c_i) \Delta t
   \]
   \[
   y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}) = y'(d_i) \Delta t
   \]

4. **Express in Terms of Derivatives**: Substitute these expressions into the formula for \( s_i \):
   \[
   s_i \approx \sqrt{(x'(c_i) \Delta t)^2 + (y'(d_i) \Delta t)^2}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   s_i \approx \Delta t \sqrt{x'(c_i)^2 + y'(d_i)^2}
   \]

5. **Sum Over All Segments**: The total arc length \( S \) is the sum of all these segment lengths:
   \[
   S \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i = \Delta t \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{x'(c_i)^2 + y'(d_i)^2}
   \]

6. **Take the Limit as \( n \to \infty \)**: As \( n \) approaches infinity, \(\Delta t\) becomes infinitesimally small, and \( c_i \) and \( d_i \) converge to the same point within each sub-interval. Thus, we can express the arc length as an integral:
   \[
   S = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2} \, dt
   \]

This integral gives the exact arc length of the curve from \( t = a \) to \( t = b \).

To calculate the arc length of a parametric curve given by \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), you use the formula:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

Given the parametric equations:
\[ x(t) = \cos t + t \sin t \]
\[ y(t) = \sin t - t \cos t \]

We need to find \( \frac{dx}{dt} \) and \( \frac{dy}{dt} \).

### Step 1: Differentiate \( x(t) \)

Using the product rule for differentiation:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\cos t + t \sin t) = -\sin t + (\sin t + t \cos t)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin t + \sin t + t \cos t = t \cos t
\]

### Step 2: Differentiate \( y(t) \)

Again, using the product rule:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\sin t - t \cos t) = \cos t - (\cos t + t (-\sin t))
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = \cos t - \cos t + t \sin t = t \sin t
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 \)

Now, compute:
\[
\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 = (t \cos t)^2 = t^2 \cos^2 t
\]
\[
\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 = (t \sin t)^2 = t^2 \sin^2 t
\]

Add these two expressions:
\[
\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 = t^2 \cos^2 t + t^2 \sin^2 t = t^2 (\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t)
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \( \cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1 \), we have:
\[
t^2 (\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t) = t^2
\]

### Step 4: Integrate to find the arc length

The arc length \( L \) is given by:
\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{t^2} \, dt = \int_{a}^{b} |t| \, dt
\]

Since the interval is from \( t = \frac{\pi}{6} \) to \( t = \frac{\pi}{4} \), and both are positive, we have:
\[
L = \int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} t \, dt
\]

Calculate the integral:
\[
L = \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} \right]_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}
\]

Evaluate at the bounds:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)^2 \right)
\]
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi^2}{16} - \frac{\pi^2}{36} \right)
\]

Find a common denominator and simplify:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{9\pi^2}{144} - \frac{4\pi^2}{144} \right)
\]
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{5\pi^2}{144}
\]
\[
L = \frac{5\pi^2}{288}
\]

Thus, the arc length of the parametric curve from \( t = \frac{\pi}{6} \) to \( t = \frac{\pi}{4} \) is:
\[
L = \frac{5\pi^2}{288}
\]

To find the arc length \( L \) of a parametric curve defined by \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), you can use the formula:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Differentiate \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \):**  
   Compute the derivatives \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dy}{dt}\).

2. **Substitute into the formula:**  
   Plug these derivatives into the arc length formula.

3. **Simplify the integrand:**  
   Simplify the expression under the square root if possible.

4. **Evaluate the integral:**  
   Integrate with respect to \( t \) over the interval \([a, b]\).

### Example

Suppose you have a parametric curve given by:
\[ x(t) = t^2, \quad y(t) = t^3 \]
and you want to find the arc length from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \).

1. **Differentiate:**
   \[
   \frac{dx}{dt} = 2t, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = 3t^2
   \]

2. **Substitute into the formula:**
   \[
   L = \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{(2t)^2 + (3t^2)^2} \, dt = \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{4t^2 + 9t^4} \, dt
   \]

3. **Simplify the integrand:**
   \[
   L = \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{t^2(4 + 9t^2)} \, dt = \int_{0}^{1} t\sqrt{4 + 9t^2} \, dt
   \]

4. **Evaluate the integral:**
   Use substitution to solve this integral. Let \( u = 4 + 9t^2 \), then \( du = 18t \, dt \) or \( t \, dt = \frac{1}{18} \, du \).

   Change the limits of integration:
   - When \( t = 0 \), \( u = 4 \).
   - When \( t = 1 \), \( u = 13 \).

   The integral becomes:
   \[
   L = \int_{4}^{13} \frac{1}{18} \sqrt{u} \, du
   \]

   Evaluate the integral:
   \[
   L = \frac{1}{18} \cdot \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \bigg|_{4}^{13} = \frac{1}{27} \left[ 13^{3/2} - 4^{3/2} \right]
   \]

   Calculate the values:
   \[
   L = \frac{1}{27} \left[ \sqrt{13^3} - \sqrt{4^3} \right] = \frac{1}{27} \left[ \sqrt{2197} - 8 \right]
   \]

This gives you the arc length of the curve from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \).

To find the arc length \( S \) of a curve defined parametrically by \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), you can use the formula derived from the Pythagorean theorem. Here's how it works:

1. **Parametric Representation**: Assume the curve is given by \( x = x(t) \) and \( y = y(t) \), where \( t \) ranges over some interval \([a, b]\).

2. **Differential Elements**: The differential changes in \( x \) and \( y \) are given by:
   \[
   dx = \frac{dx}{dt} dt = x'(t) dt
   \]
   \[
   dy = \frac{dy}{dt} dt = y'(t) dt
   \]

3. **Arc Length of a Small Segment**: For a small segment of the curve, the length \( ds \) can be approximated using:
   \[
   ds \approx \sqrt{(dx)^2 + (dy)^2}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( dx \) and \( dy \), we get:
   \[
   ds = \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2} \, dt
   \]

4. **Total Arc Length**: To find the total arc length \( S \) from \( t = a \) to \( t = b \), integrate \( ds \):
   \[
   S = \int_a^b \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2} \, dt
   \]

This integral gives you the total arc length of the curve over the interval \([a, b]\). The Mean Value Theorem is used to justify replacing the difference quotient with the derivative when \( \Delta t \to 0 \), ensuring that the approximation becomes exact in the limit.

To calculate the arc length of a parametric curve given by \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), you use the formula:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

For the given parametric equations:
\[ x(t) = \cos t + t \sin t \]
\[ y(t) = \sin t - t \cos t \]

with the interval \( t \in \left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4}\right] \).

### Step 1: Find \( \frac{dx}{dt} \)

Using the product rule:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin t + (\sin t + t \cos t)
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = t \cos t
\]

### Step 2: Find \( \frac{dy}{dt} \)

Using the product rule:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = \cos t - (\cos t - t \sin t)
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = t \sin t
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 \)

\[
\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 = (t \cos t)^2 = t^2 \cos^2 t
\]
\[
\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 = (t \sin t)^2 = t^2 \sin^2 t
\]

Adding these:
\[
(t \cos t)^2 + (t \sin t)^2 = t^2 \cos^2 t + t^2 \sin^2 t = t^2 (\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t) = t^2
\]

### Step 4: Integrate to find the arc length

The integral becomes:
\[
L = \int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \sqrt{t^2} \, dt = \int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} |t| \, dt
\]

Since \( t \) is positive in the interval \(\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4}\right]\), we have:
\[
L = \int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} t \, dt
\]

Calculating the integral:
\[
L = \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} \right]_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}
\]
\[
= \frac{\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^2}{2} - \frac{\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)^2}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{\pi^2}{32} - \frac{\pi^2}{72}
\]

Finding a common denominator:
\[
= \frac{9\pi^2}{288} - \frac{4\pi^2}{288}
\]
\[
= \frac{5\pi^2}{288}
\]

Thus, the arc length is:
\[
L = \frac{5\pi^2}{288}
\]

Certainly! Let's break down the explanation step-by-step to understand how to find the arc length of a parametric curve using calculus.

### Arc Length of Parametric Curves

When dealing with parametric curves, where \( x \) and \( y \) are both functions of a parameter \( t \), the formula for the arc length \( L \) from \( t = a \) to \( t = b \) is:

\[
L = \int_a^b \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

### Example Explanation

1. **Given Functions**: Suppose you have parametric equations \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \).

2. **Derivatives**: Compute the derivatives \( \frac{dx}{dt} \) and \( \frac{dy}{dt} \).

3. **Substitute into Arc Length Formula**:
   - Substitute these derivatives into the arc length formula.
   - This gives you the integral: 
     \[
     L = \int_a^b \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
     \]

4. **Simplification**:
   - Simplify the expression under the square root if possible.
   - Sometimes, trigonometric identities or substitutions can simplify the integral.

5. **Substitution Example**:
   - If you have a term like \( 1 + \tan^2(\theta) \), recognize it as \( \sec^2(\theta) \).
   - Use substitution to simplify: if \( t = \tan(\theta) \), then \( dt = \sec^2(\theta) \, d\theta \).

6. **Evaluate the Integral**:
   - Change the limits of integration according to your substitution.
   - Evaluate the integral using standard techniques or known results (e.g., \(\int \sec(\theta) \, d\theta = \ln |\sec(\theta) + \tan(\theta)| + C\)).

7. **Back Substitution**:
   - If you used a substitution, convert back to the original variable if necessary.
   - Evaluate the definite integral using the new limits.

### Real-World Application

Calculating arc length is useful in various fields such as physics (e.g., determining the path length of an object), engineering (e.g., designing roads or roller coasters), and computer graphics (e.g., rendering curves).

### Conclusion

The key to solving these problems lies in your ability to perform derivatives, integrals, and recognize opportunities for substitution. Practicing these steps will enhance your understanding and application of calculus in real-world scenarios.
