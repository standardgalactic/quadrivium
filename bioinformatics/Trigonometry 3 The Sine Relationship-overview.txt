The text explores the relationships between the sides and angles of scalene or regular (non-right) triangles. It describes a triangle ABC where side A is opposite angle A, side B is opposite angle B, and side C is opposite angle C. By dropping a perpendicular from angle C to line AB at point P, the original triangle is divided into two right triangles, CAP and CBP.

In triangle CBP, the sine of angle B equals H/A, so H = A * sin(B). In triangle CAP, the sine of angle A equals H/B, leading to H = B * sin(A). Equating these expressions for H gives A * sin(B) = B * sin(A), which can be rearranged algebraically to show that A/sin(A) = B/sin(B).

Through symmetry, it is also deduced that this ratio is equal to C/sin(C), which can be verified by dropping a perpendicular from another vertex. This relationship will be used in subsequent discussions about the area of triangles.
