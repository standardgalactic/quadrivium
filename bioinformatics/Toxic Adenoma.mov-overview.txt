The text discusses toxic adenoma, a condition involving a hyper-functioning follicular adenoma in an otherwise normal thyroid. Toxic adenomas can occur alone or as part of multinodular goiter and are associated with TSH receptor and G protein gene mutations. Patients, typically in their 30s or 40s, present with mild hyperthyroidism symptoms without eye or skin involvement and may have a neck mass that moves during swallowing. These adenomas usually become active when they exceed about 3 cm in diameter. Occasionally, rapid growth can lead to spontaneous hemorrhage within the nodule, potentially resolving the hyperthyroidism.

Diagnosis involves scintigraphy showing either a cold nodule or a "donut ring" of activity, while cytography may reveal coarse calcifications. Typically, scintigrams display warm or hot nodules, and ultrasonography helps differentiate toxic multinodular goiter from Graves' disease. Laboratory findings include suppressed TSH levels with elevated free T3 and/or T4, and some cases present only with elevated T3 (T3 thyrotoxicosis).

Treatment options for patients, who are generally younger and fit for surgery, include radioactive iodine therapy or unilateral thyroidectomy. The latter often cures hyperthyroidism while preserving the health of the opposite thyroid lobe, thus avoiding hypothyroidism risks associated with radiotherapy.
