This text provides an explanation of how to conduct exact tests for goodness-of-fit using binomial distributions, particularly focusing on scenarios where you have a fixed number of trials with two possible outcomes (success or failure). The content outlines steps to calculate p-values under different probability assumptions and demonstrates the use of R programming language to perform these calculations.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Binomial Distribution Basics**:
   - The binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes (success or failure).
   - Parameters include the number of trials \( n \) and the probability of success \( p \).

2. **Goodness-of-Fit Test**:
   - This test assesses how well observed data fit an expected distribution.
   - In this context, it's used to determine if the observed frequency of successes in a binomial experiment matches what is expected under a specified probability.

3. **Calculating P-Values**:
   - The p-value represents the probability of observing results as extreme or more extreme than those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
   - For a two-tailed test, you consider both tails of the distribution (extreme low and high outcomes).

4. **Using R for Calculations**:
   - The text provides an example of how to use R to calculate probabilities and p-values.
   - It demonstrates summing probabilities from 0 up to a specific number of successes (and similarly from the other end) to compute two-tailed p-values.

5. **Example Scenarios**:
   - **50-50 Split**: A scenario where each outcome has an equal probability (e.g., \( p = 0.5 \)).
   - **75% Probability**: A different scenario where the probability of success is higher (e.g., \( p = 0.75 \)).

6. **Statistical Significance**:
   - The text explains how to interpret p-values in terms of statistical significance, typically using an alpha level of 0.05.
   - If the calculated p-value is less than 0.05, the result is considered statistically significant.

7. **Resources**:
   - It mentions that R code and detailed explanations are available on platforms like RPubs and GitHub for further exploration.

This explanation is useful for anyone looking to understand or implement exact tests of goodness-of-fit using binomial distributions in statistical analysis with R.

It looks like you're working with a statistical analysis example using R, specifically focusing on binomial distributions and hypothesis testing. Here's a brief overview of what you've described:

### Context

1. **Binomial Distribution**: You are dealing with situations where there are two possible outcomes (e.g., success/failure, choice A/choice B) for each trial.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**: You're conducting tests to determine if the observed results significantly differ from what was expected under a specific hypothesis.

### Key Concepts

1. **Goodness of Fit Test**: This test assesses how well the observed data fit a particular distribution. In your case, it's about checking if the observed frequency of successes matches the expected frequency based on a given probability.

2. **Two-Tailed Hypothesis Test**: You're considering deviations in both directions (both higher and lower than expected) from the hypothesized proportion.

3. **Small p-value Method**: This involves calculating the probability of obtaining results as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed data under the null hypothesis. If this probability is small enough (typically less than 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis.

### Example Analysis

- **Scenario 1**: You expected a 50% chance of success (p = 0.5) and ran 15 trials. You found that only 7 were successful, which was significantly different from what was expected at p < 0.05.

- **Scenario 2**: You adjusted the expectation to a 75% chance of success (p = 0.75) and again ran 15 trials. Observing only 7 successes resulted in a statistically significant finding (p = 0.017), indicating that the result was unlikely under the null hypothesis.

### Implementation in R

- **Binomial Probabilities**: You calculate probabilities for different numbers of successes using `dbinom()` or similar functions.
  
- **Cumulative Probabilities**: For hypothesis testing, you sum probabilities to find p-values (`pbinom()` can be useful here).

- **Visualization**: Plotting these distributions helps visualize where the observed data fall relative to expectations.

### Resources

You mentioned that your work is available on RPubs and GitHub. These platforms are great for sharing R Markdown documents, allowing others to see both the code and its output in a rendered format.
