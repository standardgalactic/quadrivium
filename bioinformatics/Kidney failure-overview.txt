Kidney failure can lead to coagulation issues and increased bleeding risks during surgery. This is because uremia (a condition associated with kidney failure) impairs platelet function, including adhesion, aggregation, and release, thereby prolonging bleeding time. Desmopressin might help correct prolonged bleeding times; however, if it fails and there's a significant risk of bleeding, platelet transfusion could be necessary. Additionally, hemodialysis may be required to address the underlying uremia.
