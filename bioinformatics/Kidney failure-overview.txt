Kidney failure can lead to coagulation issues and increased bleeding risks during surgery. This is because uremia (a condition associated with kidney failure) impairs platelet function, including adhesion, aggregation, and release, thereby prolonging bleeding time. Desmopressin might help correct prolonged bleeding times; however, if it fails and there's a significant risk of bleeding, platelet transfusion could be necessary. Additionally, hemodialysis may be required to address the underlying uremia.

Kidney failure can lead to coagulation issues, increasing the risk of bleeding during surgery. This is due to uremia, which impairs platelet function by reducing their adhesion, aggregation, and release capabilities, resulting in prolonged bleeding times proportional to the clotting defect's severity.

Desmopressin may help correct bleeding time; however, if bleeding persists as a risk or problem, a platelet transfusion might be necessary. Additionally, hemodialysis could be required to address the underlying uremia contributing to these coagulation issues.
