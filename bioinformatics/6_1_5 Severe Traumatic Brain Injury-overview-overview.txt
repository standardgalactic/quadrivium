The text provides guidelines for managing patients with intracranial mass lesions, focusing on epidural hematomas. Key considerations include:

1. **Clinical Indicators**: Mass lesions should be suspected in patients exhibiting altered mental states, pupillary abnormalities (such as unilateral dilation or asymmetry), and abnormal motor posturing.

2. **Pre-Surgical Considerations**: Before surgery, assess the Glasgow Coma Scale score, pupillary reflexes, existing comorbidities, CT scan results, patient age, and intracranial pressure. Continuous monitoring for neurological changes is essential.

3. **Epidural Hematomas**: These account for 3% of traumatic brain injuries, increasing to 9-10% in comatose patients. They often result from middle meningeal artery injury due to a parietal skull fracture, primarily affecting males aged 20-30.

4. **Clinical Presentation**: Many patients with epidural hematomas are initially comatose, experiencing a loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval before deterioration.

5. **Management Strategies**:
   - **Non-Surgical Candidates**: Patients with clots less than 15mm thick or under 30ml in volume, and no more than 5mm midline shift who are non-comatose without focal neurological signs can be managed non-surgically. These patients need regular neurological exams and follow-up CT scans.
   - **Surgical Indications**: Immediate surgery is recommended for patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3-8, hematomas larger than 30ml regardless of coma or focal signs, comatose patients, or those showing neurological decline. Timely surgical intervention is crucial to prevent worsening outcomes.

The text underscores the importance of timely and individualized decision-making based on clinical and radiological assessments.
