The text outlines the process of solving a system of differential equations by finding both particular and homogeneous solutions:

1. **Particular Solutions:**
   - The forms for \(x_p(t)\) and \(y_p(t)\) are assumed as polynomials multiplied by an exponential term:
     \[
     x_p(t) = (a t^2 + b t + c) e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_p(t) = (d t^2 + e t + f) e^{t}
     \]
   - By substituting these into the differential equations, coefficients \(a, b, c, d, e,\) and \(f\) are determined:
     \[
     a = 1, \quad b = -2, \quad c = 0
     \]
     \[
     d = 1, \quad e = 0, \quad f = 0
     \]
   - Resulting in particular solutions:
     \[
     x_p(t) = (t^2 - 2t)e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_p(t) = t^2 e^{t}
     \]

2. **Homogeneous Solutions:**
   - The homogeneous solution is derived from the auxiliary equation:
     \[
     (r^2 - 1)(r + 1)^3 = 0
     \]
   - Roots are \(r = -1, -1, -1, 1\), leading to forms for the solutions:
     \[
     x_h(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t + c_3 t^2)e^{-t} + c_4 e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_h(t) = (d_1 + d_2 t + d_3 t^2)e^{-t} + d_4 e^{t}
     \]

3. **General Solution:**
   - The general solutions combine both homogeneous and particular parts:
     \[
     x(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t + c_3 t^2)e^{-t} + c_4 e^{t} + (t^2 - 2t)e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y(t) = (d_1 + d_2 t + d_3 t^2)e^{-t} + d_4 e^{t} + t^2 e^{t}
     \]

4. **Applying Initial Conditions:**
   - Given initial conditions \(x(0) = 0\) and \(y(0) = 1\), these are used to solve for constants:
     - For \(x(t)\):
       \[
       x(0) = c_1 + c_4 = 0
       \]
     - For \(y(t)\):
       \[
       y(0) = d_1 + d_4 = 1
       \]

The process involves systematic substitution, solving for coefficients, and applying initial conditions to find specific solutions.
