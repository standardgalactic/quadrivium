The text provides an overview of key properties related to the Euclidean norm (or length) of vectors in Euclidean space, focusing on four fundamental concepts:

1. **Non-negativity**: The norm or length of any vector is always non-negative, being zero only if the vector itself is the zero vector.

2. **Scalar Multiplication**: When a scalar multiplies a vector, the resulting vector's norm equals the absolute value of the scalar times the original vector's norm. This ensures the norm remains positive unless the vector is zero.

3. **Triangle Inequality**: For any vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), the triangle inequality states:
   \[
   \| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \| \leq \| \mathbf{u} \| + \| \mathbf{v} \|
   \]
   Equality holds if \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) are collinear.

4. **Proof of Triangle Inequality**: The proof involves:
   - Squaring both sides.
   - Using the dot product property: \( \| \mathbf{u} \|^2 = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} \).
   - Expanding and applying Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: 
     \[
     |\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}| \leq \| \mathbf{u} \| \cdot \| \mathbf{v} \|
     \]
   This leads to:
   \[
   \| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \|^2 \leq (\| \mathbf{u} \| + \| \mathbf{v} \|)^2
   \]
   Taking the square root gives the triangle inequality.

Additionally, the text discusses vector norms and dot products:
- The squared norm of \( (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \) is expanded as:
  \[
  \|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} + 2(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}
  \]
- Similarly, for \( (\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v})^2 \):
  \[
  \|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2 = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} - 2(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}
  \]
- Substitution and simplification of these expressions lead to elegant cancellations, illustrating how vector algebra can simplify computations involving dot products and norms.

The text also explains the Euclidean inner product (dot product) of two vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), denoted as "u Â· v". This operation sums the products of corresponding components from each vector, providing a method to compute their scalar product. The dot notation simplifies understanding and calculation of this inner product.
