The text addresses solving an initial value problem for the differential equation \( y' = e^{-x^2} \). Although the equation is separable, it cannot be solved explicitly in terms of elementary functions. Instead, the solution is expressed using an integral form based on the fundamental theorem of calculus.

To solve it, we separate variables and integrate, resulting in:

\[ y(x) = 5 + \int_{3}^{x} e^{-t^2} \, dt \]

This expression uses the initial condition \( y(3) = 5 \). The integral \( \int e^{-t^2} \, dt \) cannot be simplified further due to its complexity, so the solution is left in this integral form. This representation satisfies the requirements of the problem fully.
