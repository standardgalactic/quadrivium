The course includes a textbook that serves as an additional resource, though lectures may not strictly follow its content. The instructor aims to create a rich environment of resources for learners. A humorous example will be used to demonstrate the application of limits in life sciences, intended to pique interest. The course will then guide participants through building their understanding of using limits step-by-step. By the end, it's expected that students will find the subject fascinating and straightforward. Additionally, the instructor plans to introduce a computer algebra system, showing how to install and use it for performing mathematical calculations easily by writing code.
