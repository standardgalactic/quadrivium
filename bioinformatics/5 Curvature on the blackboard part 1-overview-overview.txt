Curvature is a key concept that describes how sharply a curve bends at any point. Intuitively, it can be likened to driving on a road where gentle curves allow for higher speeds and sharp turns require slowing down. Mathematically, curvature (\(\kappa\)) is defined as the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length along the curve.

The formula for curvature involves derivatives, specifically:

\[
\kappa = \left\| \frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} \right\|
\]

where \( \mathbf{T}(s) \) is the unit tangent vector at a given arc length \( s \). This can be expressed using the chain rule as:

\[
\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} = \frac{\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{dt}}{\frac{ds}{dt}}
\]

Here, \( \frac{ds}{dt} \) represents speed. Curvature measures how sharply a path bends independently of the speed at which it is traversed.

Additionally, the text introduces the radius of curvature (\(\rho\)), which is the reciprocal of curvature:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{\kappa}
\]

The radius of curvature corresponds to the radius of a circle that best approximates the curve at any given point. A small curvature implies a large radius (gentle bend), while a larger curvature results in a smaller radius (sharper turn).

Overall, these mathematical formulations provide a clear way to quantify and understand curvature and its relationship with the radius of curvature, translating intuitive concepts into precise expressions.
