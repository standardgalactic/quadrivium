Here's a summary of the key points regarding geometric series and their convergence:

### Geometric Series

A geometric series is expressed as:

\[ S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots \]

where \( a \) is the first term, and \( r \) is the common ratio.

#### Convergence Criteria

- **Convergent**: The series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio \( |r| < 1 \). The sum of an infinite convergent geometric series can be calculated using:

  \[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]

- **Divergent**: If \( |r| \geq 1 \), the series diverges.

### Example Analysis

In the provided example, a geometric series has:
- First term \( a = 5 \).
- Common ratio \( r = \frac{8}{3} \).

Since \( |r| = \left|\frac{8}{3}\right| > 1 \), the series diverges.

### nth Term Test for Divergence

The nth term test helps determine divergence:

- If the limit of the sequence's terms as \( n \to \infty \) is not zero, i.e., 

  \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0 \]

  then the series diverges.

For this example, the term is:

\[ a_n = 5 \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^n \]

As \( n \to \infty \), \( a_n \) increases indefinitely because \( \left|\frac{8}{3}\right| > 1 \), confirming divergence.

### Conclusion

The series diverges due to the common ratio's absolute value being greater than one. The nth term test further supports this, as the terms do not approach zero. This provides an efficient method for quickly identifying divergence in such series.
