The text introduces double integrals as an extension of single integrals, used to calculate the volume beneath a surface defined by a two-variable function. A single integral calculates the area under a curve in 2D, while a double integral finds the total volume under a 3D surface over a given region.

To explain this concept, the presenter divides a square region on the x-y plane into smaller squares, each contributing a small volume based on the height determined by \( f(x, y) \). The sum of these volumes gives the total volume beneath the surface. 

Double integrals allow for integration over regions bounded not only by straight lines but also curves. One can integrate with respect to \( x \) first and then \( y \), or vice versa, demonstrating Fubini's theorem which ensures both orders yield the same result under specific conditions.

The process involves treating one variable as constant during integration, completing the inner integral before the outer one. This method guarantees consistent results for the final volume calculation when the function and region satisfy Fubini's theorem requirements.
