The text provides a summary of rules for manipulating inequalities and demonstrates how to solve the inequality \(\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3} < 0\).

### Rules for Inequalities

1. **Addition/Subtraction:** You can add or subtract the same number from both sides without changing the direction of the inequality.

2. **Multiplication/Division by a Positive Number:** Multiplying or dividing both sides by a positive number does not change the inequality's direction.

3. **Multiplication/Division by a Negative Number:** When you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, reverse the inequality's direction.

### Solving \(\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3} < 0\)

To determine when this expression is negative:

1. **Factor the Numerator:**
   - \(X^2 - 1 = (X - 1)(X + 1)\), with critical points at \(X = 1\) and \(X = -1\).

2. **Analyze the Denominator:**
   - The denominator \(X + 3 = 0\) at \(X = -3\). This point is excluded from solutions.

3. **Determine Intervals:**
   - Divide the number line into intervals based on critical points:
     - \((-\infty, -3)\)
     - \((-3, -1)\)
     - \((-1, 1)\)
     - \((1, \infty)\)

4. **Test Each Interval:**

   - **\((-\infty, -3)\):** Choose \(X = -4\).
     - Numerator is positive; Denominator is negative.
     - Expression is positive.

   - **\((-3, -1)\):** Choose \(X = -2\).
     - Both numerator and denominator are positive.
     - Expression is positive.

   - **\((-1, 1)\):** Choose \(X = 0\).
     - Numerator is negative; Denominator is positive.
     - Expression is negative.

   - **\((1, \infty)\):** Choose \(X = 2\).
     - Both numerator and denominator are positive.
     - Expression is positive.

The inequality \(\frac{X^2 - 1}{X + 3} < 0\) holds in the interval \((-1, 1)\).

The text explains solving problems involving absolute values with definitions and examples:

1. **Definition**: 
   - Absolute value \( |x| \) converts any number into a non-negative value:
     - If \( x \geq 0 \), then \( |x| = x \).
     - If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \).

2. **Example Problem**: 
   - Solve \( |x - 3| = 5 \):
     - Case 1: \( x - 3 = 5 \) gives \( x = 8 \).
     - Case 2: \( -(x - 3) = 5 \) gives \( x = -2 \).
   - Solutions are \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -2 \).

3. **Inequality Problem**:
   - Solve \( |x - 3| < 5 \):
     - Case 1: \( x - 3 < 5 \) results in \( 3 \leq x < 8 \).
     - Case 2: \( -(x - 3) < 5 \) results in \( -2 < x < 3 \).
   - The solution is the union of intervals: \( (-2, 3) \cup [3, 8) \).

The text provides a structured approach to handling absolute value equations and inequalities by considering different cases based on whether expressions are non-negative or negative.
