Welcome to this course on Abstract Algebra.
Now there are wonderful courses on YouTube about abstract algebra.
In actual fact I've got a favorite and I'll put the link down below this video.
What we're going to do in this course though is get some pen on paper.
I want you to understand and I want you to practice abstract algebra.
It is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
Now we're going to start off very boringly.
It really is boring initially.
The first few videos, I'm sorry, that's not the most exciting thing,
but stick to it, stick with it.
It gets better and better as we go.
We're going to start with the sets.
Everyone understands sets, but stick with it.
Enjoy this course on abstract algebra.
