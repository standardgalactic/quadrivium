The text discusses a problem involving two incident light rays entering different mediums, resulting in a phase difference of 5.65 radians (radiances) when they exit. This phase difference is converted into approximately 0.8992 wavelengths, given that one wavelength equals \(2\pi\) radians. To find the minimum length (\(L\)) required to achieve this phase difference, the formula used is:

\[ L = \frac{0.8992 \times 400}{N_1 - N_2} \]

where \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) are the refractive indices of the mediums, and it's given that \(N_1 - N_2 = 0.1\). This calculation yields a minimum length (\(L\)) of 360 nanometers.

Additionally, a second scenario involves determining which path through plastic blocks with different refractive indices allows light to exit faster. The travel time for each path is calculated using:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance} \times N}{C} \]

where \(N\) is the refractive index and \(C\) is the speed of light. By comparing these times, one can identify which path results in the shortest travel time.

The text integrates wave optics concepts like phase difference and wavelength with classical mechanics principles related to velocity and time, focusing on how varying refractive indices influence light's speed through different media.
