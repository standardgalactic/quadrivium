The text introduces the concept of line integrals in the plane with respect to arc length. It begins by describing a three-dimensional shape defined by a function \( z = f(x, y) \). In the x-y plane, there's a curve denoted as \( c \), which lies within the domain of this function. The line integral is used to calculate the area between the surface and the curve projected onto the x-y plane.

To achieve this, we consider small segments of the curve \( c \) with length \( \Delta s \). For each segment, its height is given by the value of the function at that point on the curve. The area of a thin slice (between the curve and the surface) is approximated as the product of the function's value at the curve and the segment length (\( f(\text{curve}) \times \Delta s \)). Summing these small areas gives an approximation of the total area, which becomes exact in the limit as \( \Delta s \) approaches zero. This sum turns into a line integral expressed with an integral sign.

The curve can be parameterized using a variable \( t \), where both \( x \) and \( y \) are functions of \( t \). Alternatively, it might already be given explicitly in terms of \( x \). The differential arc length \( ds \) is derived from the vector representation of the curve, involving the derivatives of \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \). Specifically, \( ds = \sqrt{(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2} \, dt \). This allows us to express the line integral as an integral with respect to arc length: \( \int f(\mathbf{r}(t)) \, ds \), where \( ds \) incorporates the parameterization of the curve.

The text introduces the concept of line integrals in the plane with respect to arc length. It begins by describing a function \( z = f(x, y) \), which forms a three-dimensional shape over an xy-plane curve denoted as \( c \). The focus is on calculating the area from this surface down to the curve using Riemann sums, similar to techniques learned in first-year calculus.

The process involves considering small segments of the curve \( c \), each with a length \( \Delta s \) and height determined by \( f(c) \), where \( c \) is part of the domain of \( f(x, y) \). The area of these thin segments is approximated as \( f(c) \times \Delta s \). By summing these areas and taking the limit as \( \Delta s \) approaches zero, we obtain an integral that represents the total area under the curve on the surface.

The curve can be expressed explicitly in terms of \( x \), or parametrized using a parameter \( t \), leading to expressions like \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \). To find the arc length differential \( ds \), we use vector calculus, where \( r(t) = (x(t), y(t)) \) represents the curve. The differential \( ds \) is computed as:

\[ ds = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt \]

Thus, the line integral with respect to arc length becomes:

\[ \int f(r(t)) \, ds = \int f(r(t)) \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt \]

This formula allows us to calculate the integral over a curve in terms of its parameterization.
