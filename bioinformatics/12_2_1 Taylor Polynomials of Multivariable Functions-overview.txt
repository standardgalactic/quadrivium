The text explains how Taylor's expansion is applied to multivariable functions. It starts by introducing the general concept of a Taylor series in multiple variables, highlighting key components like vector \( \mathbf{x} \), vector \( \mathbf{p} \) (the point around which the function is expanded), and the use of the gradient operator \( \nabla \).

### Key Points:

1. **Taylor Expansion Basics**:
   - For multivariable functions, the Taylor expansion involves a sum over terms that include powers of vectors \( (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) \) and derivatives up to order \( r \).
   - The gradient operator \( \nabla \) is used, which in two dimensions corresponds to partial derivatives with respect to each variable.

2. **First Order (Local Linearization)**:
   - At first order (\( k = 1 \)), the Taylor expansion simplifies to a linear approximation known as local linearization.
   - This involves evaluating the function at point \( \mathbf{p} \) and adding the dot product of \( (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) \) with the gradient of the function at \( \mathbf{p} \).

3. **Example**:
   - An example is provided using a function \( f(x, y) = e^x \ln(y) \) and expanding around the point \( \mathbf{p} = (0, 1) \).
   - At \( k = 0 \), the expansion gives the value of the function at \( \mathbf{p} \), which is zero.
   - For \( k = 1 \), the gradient components are calculated, and the dot product with \( (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) \) gives the linear approximation.

4. **Higher Order Terms**:
   - The text hints at more complex calculations for higher order terms (e.g., \( k = 2 \)), where additional derivatives and combinations of vectors are involved.
   - It emphasizes understanding how dot products appear in these expansions.

5. **Conceptual Insight**:
   - The local linearization is identified as the first-order Taylor polynomial, providing a simple approximation to the function near the point \( \mathbf{p} \).
   - Higher-order terms improve the accuracy of this approximation further from \( \mathbf{p} \).

Overall, the text serves as an introduction to applying Taylor series in multiple dimensions, illustrating the process with an example and explaining the significance of local linearization.

The text describes the process of finding the local linearization (first-order Taylor polynomial) for a multivariable function \( f(x, y) = e^{x \ln(y)} \) at a specific point, referred to as vector \( p \). Here's a summary:

1. **Vector Dot Product**: The initial focus is on understanding the components of a dot product involving vectors, where each component from one vector multiplies with its corresponding component in another.

2. **Partial Derivatives**:
   - To find the local linearization, you need to compute partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \).
   - The partial derivative with respect to \( x \), treating \( y \) as a constant, is given by \( e^{x \ln(y)} \). Substituting vector \( p = (0, 1) \) into this results in zero because \( e^0 \cdot \ln(1) = 0 \).
   - The partial derivative with respect to \( y \), treating \( x \) as a constant, is computed as \( (y-1) \frac{e^{x}}{y} \). Substituting vector \( p = (0, 1) \) simplifies this expression to \( y - 1 \).

3. **Local Linearization**: This process results in the local linear approximation of the function at the point \( p \), which is essentially a plane tangent to the surface described by \( f(x, y) \). The goal is to find an approximate value for small changes around this point.

4. **Avoiding Confusion**:
   - It's important not to confuse the substitution of values in the derivatives with retaining constants that are independent of these variables during differentiation.
   - The linearization is described as a first-order Taylor polynomial, which provides an approximation of the function near the specified point.

5. **Next Steps**: The text hints at moving on to higher-order partial differentials for second-order approximations (second-order Taylor polynomials) in future discussions.

This explanation gives you an overview of how local linearization is achieved through differentiation and substitution for a specific function, with emphasis on not mixing up variables during the process.

The text provides an explanation of calculating higher order partial derivatives, specifically focusing on a scenario where \( K = 2 \). This involves finding the second-order derivative and requires incorporating several mathematical concepts:

1. **Factorials in Coefficients**: The presence of a "half" is due to dividing by \( 2! \), which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Vectors and Dot Products**: A vector notation, \( (X, Y - 1) \), is used, and the dot product of vectors involving partial derivatives (\( D_1 \) and \( D_2 \)) plays a crucial role.

3. **Squaring Terms**: The expression involves squaring the result of the dot product calculation before applying it to a function \( f \) at point \( p \).

4. **Resulting Expression**: The final expression includes terms like:
   - \( X^2 D_1^2 f(p) \)
   - \( 2X(Y-1)D_1D_2f(p) \)
   - \( (Y-1)^2 D_2^2 f(p) \)

5. **Simplification**: The entire expression is multiplied by \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Overall, the text outlines a method for calculating a specific second-order partial derivative involving vectors and their dot products, while considering factorial coefficients and algebraic simplifications.

The text discusses solving higher-order partial differential equations, specifically for a given function \( f \) at point \( p \). It outlines steps to compute the first and second partial derivatives with respect to \( x \), while treating \( y \) as a constant. The process involves:

1. Calculating the first derivative (\( D1 \)) of \( f \) with respect to \( x \), resulting in a new function involving \( e^{x \ln(y)} \).
2. Repeatedly applying \( D1 \) since there are two such operations, yielding the same expression \( e^{x \ln(y)} \).
3. Substituting specific values for \( x \) and \( y \), while noting that terms like \( x^2 \) remain unchanged as they do not depend on \( p \).
4. Computing the second partial derivative (\( D2 \)) by taking the first derivative of the new function obtained from step 1.
5. Substituting values into this second derivative and multiplying by a constant factor (a half).

The text emphasizes the iterative nature of differentiation in this context, maintaining certain terms as constants throughout the process.
