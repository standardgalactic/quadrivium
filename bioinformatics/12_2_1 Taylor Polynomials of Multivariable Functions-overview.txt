The text explains how Taylor's expansion is applied to multivariable functions. It starts by introducing the general concept of a Taylor series in multiple variables, highlighting key components like vector \( \mathbf{x} \), vector \( \mathbf{p} \) (the point around which the function is expanded), and the use of the gradient operator \( \nabla \).

### Key Points:

1. **Taylor Expansion Basics**:
   - For multivariable functions, the Taylor expansion involves a sum over terms that include powers of vectors \( (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) \) and derivatives up to order \( r \).
   - The gradient operator \( \nabla \) is used, which in two dimensions corresponds to partial derivatives with respect to each variable.

2. **First Order (Local Linearization)**:
   - At first order (\( k = 1 \)), the Taylor expansion simplifies to a linear approximation known as local linearization.
   - This involves evaluating the function at point \( \mathbf{p} \) and adding the dot product of \( (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) \) with the gradient of the function at \( \mathbf{p} \).

3. **Example**:
   - An example is provided using a function \( f(x, y) = e^x \ln(y) \) and expanding around the point \( \mathbf{p} = (0, 1) \).
   - At \( k = 0 \), the expansion gives the value of the function at \( \mathbf{p} \), which is zero.
   - For \( k = 1 \), the gradient components are calculated, and the dot product with \( (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) \) gives the linear approximation.

4. **Higher Order Terms**:
   - The text hints at more complex calculations for higher order terms (e.g., \( k = 2 \)), where additional derivatives and combinations of vectors are involved.
   - It emphasizes understanding how dot products appear in these expansions.

5. **Conceptual Insight**:
   - The local linearization is identified as the first-order Taylor polynomial, providing a simple approximation to the function near the point \( \mathbf{p} \).
   - Higher-order terms improve the accuracy of this approximation further from \( \mathbf{p} \).

Overall, the text serves as an introduction to applying Taylor series in multiple dimensions, illustrating the process with an example and explaining the significance of local linearization.

The text describes the process of finding the local linearization (first-order Taylor polynomial) for a multivariable function \( f(x, y) = e^{x \ln(y)} \) at a specific point, referred to as vector \( p \). Here's a summary:

1. **Vector Dot Product**: The initial focus is on understanding the components of a dot product involving vectors, where each component from one vector multiplies with its corresponding component in another.

2. **Partial Derivatives**:
   - To find the local linearization, you need to compute partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \).
   - The partial derivative with respect to \( x \), treating \( y \) as a constant, is given by \( e^{x \ln(y)} \). Substituting vector \( p = (0, 1) \) into this results in zero because \( e^0 \cdot \ln(1) = 0 \).
   - The partial derivative with respect to \( y \), treating \( x \) as a constant, is computed as \( (y-1) \frac{e^{x}}{y} \). Substituting vector \( p = (0, 1) \) simplifies this expression to \( y - 1 \).

3. **Local Linearization**: This process results in the local linear approximation of the function at the point \( p \), which is essentially a plane tangent to the surface described by \( f(x, y) \). The goal is to find an approximate value for small changes around this point.

4. **Avoiding Confusion**:
   - It's important not to confuse the substitution of values in the derivatives with retaining constants that are independent of these variables during differentiation.
   - The linearization is described as a first-order Taylor polynomial, which provides an approximation of the function near the specified point.

5. **Next Steps**: The text hints at moving on to higher-order partial differentials for second-order approximations (second-order Taylor polynomials) in future discussions.

This explanation gives you an overview of how local linearization is achieved through differentiation and substitution for a specific function, with emphasis on not mixing up variables during the process.

The text provides an explanation of calculating higher order partial derivatives, specifically focusing on a scenario where \( K = 2 \). This involves finding the second-order derivative and requires incorporating several mathematical concepts:

1. **Factorials in Coefficients**: The presence of a "half" is due to dividing by \( 2! \), which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Vectors and Dot Products**: A vector notation, \( (X, Y - 1) \), is used, and the dot product of vectors involving partial derivatives (\( D_1 \) and \( D_2 \)) plays a crucial role.

3. **Squaring Terms**: The expression involves squaring the result of the dot product calculation before applying it to a function \( f \) at point \( p \).

4. **Resulting Expression**: The final expression includes terms like:
   - \( X^2 D_1^2 f(p) \)
   - \( 2X(Y-1)D_1D_2f(p) \)
   - \( (Y-1)^2 D_2^2 f(p) \)

5. **Simplification**: The entire expression is multiplied by \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Overall, the text outlines a method for calculating a specific second-order partial derivative involving vectors and their dot products, while considering factorial coefficients and algebraic simplifications.

The text discusses solving higher-order partial differential equations, specifically for a given function \( f \) at point \( p \). It outlines steps to compute the first and second partial derivatives with respect to \( x \), while treating \( y \) as a constant. The process involves:

1. Calculating the first derivative (\( D1 \)) of \( f \) with respect to \( x \), resulting in a new function involving \( e^{x \ln(y)} \).
2. Repeatedly applying \( D1 \) since there are two such operations, yielding the same expression \( e^{x \ln(y)} \).
3. Substituting specific values for \( x \) and \( y \), while noting that terms like \( x^2 \) remain unchanged as they do not depend on \( p \).
4. Computing the second partial derivative (\( D2 \)) by taking the first derivative of the new function obtained from step 1.
5. Substituting values into this second derivative and multiplying by a constant factor (a half).

The text emphasizes the iterative nature of differentiation in this context, maintaining certain terms as constants throughout the process.

The text provides an overview of Taylor's expansion for multivariable functions. It begins by explaining how the single-variable Taylor series is adapted for functions with multiple variables. The key idea is to replace scalar values with vectors and employ the dot product alongside the gradient (del operator) to account for changes in more than one dimension.

For a first-order approximation, the text explains that the local linearization of a multivariable function near a specific point \( \mathbf{p} \) emerges naturally from this expansion. The result is similar to what was previously learned about linear approximations but generalized for multiple variables. This linear term corresponds to the first-order Taylor polynomial.

The explanation uses an example where \( f(x, y) = e^{x \ln(y)} \), and the point of interest is \( \mathbf{p} = (0, 1) \). Starting with \( k=0 \), it computes \( f(\mathbf{p}) \) as zero. For \( k=1 \), the text describes how to find the gradient at \( \mathbf{p} \), which involves computing partial derivatives with respect to each variable, and then forming a dot product with \( (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) \).

The key takeaway is understanding that local linearization in multivariable calculus stems from this first-order Taylor polynomial. The text emphasizes not assuming the same process applies for higher orders without adjustments, noting how the formula's structure changes beyond \( k=1 \).

The text provides an explanation of how to calculate the vector dot product and apply it in the context of finding a local linearization (first-order Taylor polynomial) of a multivariable function. Specifically, it details steps for evaluating the partial derivatives at a point \( \mathbf{p} = (0, 1) \).

Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Vector Dot Product**: The dot product is computed as the sum of products of corresponding components: first component times first component plus second component times second component.

2. **Function and Point**: Consider a function \( f(x, y) = e^{x \ln(y)} \). We evaluate this at point \( \mathbf{p} = (0, 1) \).

3. **Partial Derivatives**:
   - The partial derivative with respect to \( x \), \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\), is calculated as \( y e^{x \ln(y)} \). At point \( \mathbf{p} = (0, 1) \), this evaluates to 0.
   - The partial derivative with respect to \( y \), \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\), involves treating \( x \) as a constant. It simplifies to \((y-1)\frac{e^{x}}{y}\). At point \( \mathbf{p} = (0, 1) \), this evaluates to \( 0 + (y - 1)/1 = y - 1\).

4. **Local Linearization**: The text explains that the local linear approximation (first-order Taylor polynomial) of a function at a point is derived using these partial derivatives.

5. **Clarification**: Emphasis is placed on not confusing different variables and correctly substituting values into the expressions when evaluating at specific points.

6. **Next Steps**: It hints at progressing to second-order partial derivatives for higher-order approximations, which involve more complex calculations but are based on similar principles as first-order derivatives.

The explanation aims to clarify how these mathematical operations work together in the context of multivariable calculus, particularly focusing on linearization and approximation techniques.

1. **Setup**: The problem involves calculating second-order partial derivatives, which introduces factorials in the denominator (specifically, \( 2! = 2 \)), resulting in a half (\( \frac{1}{2} \)) being applied.

2. **Expression Components**:
   - Variables: \( x \), \( y \) (with \( y-1 \) used in calculations).
   - Derivatives: \( D_1 \), \( D_2 \) represent partial derivatives.
   - Vector: \( \mathbf{p} = (x, y-1) \).

3. **Dot Product and Squaring**:
   - Compute the dot product of vectors involving derivatives: \( xD_1 + (y-1)D_2 \).
   - Square this result before applying it to a function \( f \) evaluated at point \( p \).

4. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression includes terms like \( x^2 D_1^2 f(p) \), \( 2x(y-1)D_1D_2 f(p) \), and \( (y-1)^2 D_2^2 f(p) \).
   - All components are multiplied by a factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \).

The text essentially describes the algebraic manipulation required to compute a specific second-order partial derivative expression, emphasizing the importance of squaring the dot product and applying factorial-based coefficients.

The text outlines the process of finding higher-order partial derivatives for a given function \( f \) with respect to variables \( x \) and \( y \). Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Setup**: The function is expressed in terms of \( x^2 \), \( (y-1)^2 \), and involves an exponential component \( e^{x \ln y} \).

2. **First Partial Derivative with Respect to \( x \)**:
   - Treat \( y \) as a constant.
   - Differentiate \( f \) with respect to \( x \), resulting in the derivative of \( e^{x \ln y} \) which is \( e^{x \ln y} \cdot \ln y \).
   - The factor \( x^2 \) remains unchanged during this differentiation.

3. **Second Partial Derivative**:
   - Differentiate again with respect to \( x \), leading to another instance of \( e^{x \ln y} \cdot (\ln y)^2 \).
   - Multiply by the constant factor \( x^2 \).

4. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - Substitute specific values for \( x \) and \( y \) into the derived expressions.
   - The process involves calculating derivatives step-by-step, resulting in a new function each time.

5. **Higher-Order Derivatives**:
   - Continue this process to obtain higher-order partial derivatives as needed.
   - Each derivative calculation builds on the previous one, often involving repeated differentiation and substitution of values.

6. **Final Steps**:
   - After obtaining the necessary derivatives, substitute specific points (like 0 and 1) into these expressions.
   - Multiply by constants as required in the context (e.g., \( \frac{1}{2} \)) to complete the evaluation.

This methodical approach ensures accurate calculation of partial derivatives for complex functions involving exponential terms.
