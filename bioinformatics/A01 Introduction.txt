Hi there, my name is Jean Klopp and I'm a surgeon at the Acute Care Surgery Unit in the famous
Ghriteskir Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. This is going to be an exciting course on the
conditions that we see most commonly in the unit. In the very next video we're going to
do a few housekeeping rules but I really hope that you enjoy the series.
