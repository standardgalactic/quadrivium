Here's a summary of the text regarding factoring algebraic expressions:

### Factoring Process Overview

**Example: \(x^2 - 3x\)**

1. **Identify Common Factors:**
   - The terms are \(x^2\) and \(-3x\).
   - Both have \(x\) as a common factor.

2. **Find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF):**
   - GCF is \(x\).

3. **Factor Out the GCF:**
   - Expression becomes \(x(x - 3)\).

**Result:** The factored form of \(x^2 - 3x\) is \(x(x - 3)\).

### Factoring Another Expression: \(6x^2 + 9xy\)

1. **Identify Coefficients and Variables:**
   - Coefficients are 6 and 9; both terms have \(x\).

2. **Find GCD of Coefficients:**
   - GCD is 3.

3. **Factor Out the GCD and Common Variables:**
   - Factor out \(3x\): \(3x(2x + 3y)\).

**Result:** The factored form is \(3x(2x + 3y)\).

### Factoring a Quadratic Expression: \(2x^2 + 7x + 3\)

1. **Identify Coefficients:**
   - Leading coefficient \(a = 2\), linear term \(b = 7\), constant \(c = 3\).

2. **Multiply \(a\) and \(c\):**
   - Product is \(6\).

3. **Find Two Numbers for Factoring:**
   - Numbers are 6 and 1 (product 6, sum 7).

4. **Rewrite Middle Term:**
   - Rewrite as \(2x^2 + 6x + 1x + 3\).

5. **Factor by Grouping:**
   - Group terms: \((2x^2 + 6x) + (1x + 3)\).
   - Factor each group: \(2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3)\).

6. **Factor Out Common Binomial:**
   - Result is \((2x + 1)(x + 3)\).

**Result:** The factored form of \(2x^2 + 7x + 3\) is \((2x + 1)(x + 3)\).

The provided text outlines key techniques for factoring polynomial expressions, emphasizing difference of squares, cubes, and rational expressions. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Difference of Squares**: This technique applies to expressions like \(a^2 - b^2\), which can be factored into \((a-b)(a+b)\). For example, \(25x^2 - 81y^2\) factors into \((5x-9y)(5x+9y)\).

2. **Difference and Sum of Cubes**:
   - The difference of cubes, \(a^3 - b^3\), is factored as \((a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\).
   - The sum of cubes, \(a^3 + b^3\), factors into \((a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\). An example provided involves simplifying the rational expression \(\frac{2x^2 + 7x + 6}{x^2 - 4}\).

3. **Factoring Rational Expressions**: This process includes dividing polynomials and simplifying by factorization.
   - In the given example, \( \frac{2x^2 + 7x + 6}{x^2 - 4} \), the numerator is factored into \((2x+3)(x+2)\) and the denominator as a difference of squares into \((x-2)(x+2)\).
   - Simplifying involves canceling common factors, such as \( (x+2) \), resulting in \(\frac{2x+3}{x-2}\).

The text highlights these factorization methods to simplify and solve algebraic expressions effectively.
