In this lecture I want to introduce you to the mock data that we're going to use in this lecture series.
Now it's just that mock data. It doesn't belong to any real patient.
And it is about appendicitis.
But you can relax. You needn't know anything about acute appendicitis.
It's just about the variables and the data that we collect
and that we're going to use to do our statistical analysis with.
Have a look.
Okay.
