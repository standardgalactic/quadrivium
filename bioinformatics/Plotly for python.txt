My name is Jean Klopper and I'm a Surgeon at Krutuskir Hospital and Senior Lecturer
at the University of Cape Town.
Now I run the Klopper Research Group where I really support our postgraduate students
in their research.
My main field of research is machine learning in the clinical setting.
In the support of research I have a lot of online courses here on YouTube but also on
Udemy and the massive open online course platform Coursera where I really teach biostatistics.
It's what it's all about.
Now when we use Python locally one of my favourite plotting libraries is Plotly.
You can do Plotly online but you can also use it in Python and many other computer languages
as well.
So this whole series is going to be about Plotly and I'm going to start off with by just showing
you the basics and the easiest way to get going is through a bar chart.
So subscribe to this channel, hit that notification button, every time a new lecture comes out
and a new tutorial comes out you'll be notified about it.
So please do that.
Let's watch this first video on bar charts.
Thanks for the sayings.
