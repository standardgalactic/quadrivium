The text outlines the process of finding the Laplace transform of \( \sin(2t) \) using integration by parts. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: The Laplace transform is defined as an improper integral from 0 to infinity of \( e^{-st} \sin(2t) \, dt \).

2. **Integration by Parts**: 
   - Choose \( u = \sin(2t) \) and \( dv = e^{-st} \, dt \).
   - Then \( du = 2\cos(2t) \, dt \) and \( v = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \).

3. **First Integration by Parts**:
   - Apply the integration by parts formula: \( \int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du \).
   - This results in an expression involving \( \cos(2t) \).

4. **Second Integration by Parts**:
   - Repeat the process with \( u = \cos(2t) \) and \( dv = e^{-st} \, dt \).
   - Then \( du = -2\sin(2t) \, dt \) and \( v = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \).

5. **Simplification**:
   - After applying integration by parts twice, the original integral reappears with a factor.
   - Solve for the integral in terms of itself.

6. **Boundary Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the boundary terms at \( t = 0 \) and \( t = \infty \).
   - Note that terms involving \( e^{-st} \) at infinity tend to zero if \( s > 0 \).

7. **Final Result**:
   - Solve for the Laplace transform, resulting in \( \frac{2}{s^2 + 4} \).

The process involves careful application of integration by parts and evaluation of limits, ensuring convergence with \( s > 0 \).

The text describes solving for the Laplace transform of \(\sin(2t)\) through a series of steps and considerations. Initially, it evaluates the behavior at infinity, noting that certain terms become zero due to multiplication by zero or decay. The process involves manipulating expressions to isolate the Laplace transform:

1. **Infinity Considerations**: Terms involving \(e^{st}\) as \(t \to \infty\) result in zero because they are multiplied by zero.

2. **Expression Manipulation**: The text rearranges terms to solve for the Laplace transform:
   - It starts with an expression: \(4/s^2 + 1\) times the Laplace transform equals \(2/s^2\).
   - It simplifies this to find a common denominator and isolates the Laplace transform on one side.

3. **Final Solution**: The Laplace transform of \(\sin(2t)\) is derived as:
   \[
   \frac{2}{s^2 + 4}
   \]
   This matches the standard form for \(\sin(at)\), which is \(\frac{a}{s^2 + a^2}\).

The text acknowledges some initial confusion in sign changes but ultimately confirms the correct result. It emphasizes practice with Laplace transforms, as they require careful manipulation and understanding of limits at infinity.

The text describes the process of finding the Laplace transform of \( \sin(2t) \). The author begins by setting up the integral for the Laplace transform:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st} \sin(2t) \, dt
\]

Using integration by parts, they choose \( u = \sin(2t) \) and \( dv = e^{-st} dt \), leading to derivatives and integrals of these functions. The process iterates between sine and cosine:

1. First iteration:
   - \( u = \sin(2t) \), \( du = 2\cos(2t)dt \)
   - \( v = -\frac{1}{s}e^{-st} \)

This results in:

\[
-\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \sin(2t) \bigg|_{0}^{\infty} + \frac{2}{s} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st} \cos(2t) \, dt
\]

The boundary terms evaluate to zero as \( t \to \infty \), and the remaining integral involves \( \cos(2t) \).

2. Second iteration:
   - \( u = \cos(2t) \), \( du = -2\sin(2t)dt \)
   - \( v = -\frac{1}{s}e^{-st} \)

This results in:

\[
-\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \cos(2t) \bigg|_{0}^{\infty} + \frac{2}{s} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st} \sin(2t) \, dt
\]

Again, the boundary terms evaluate to zero as \( t \to \infty \), and the integral returns to the original form.

The author concludes by recognizing a system of equations involving these integrals. Solving this system yields:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st} \sin(2t) \, dt = \frac{2}{s^2 + 4}
\]

This is the Laplace transform of \( \sin(2t) \). The process highlights integration by parts and the evaluation of boundary terms at infinity.

The text is an explanation of solving for the Laplace transform of the sine function, specifically \(\sin(2t)\). The speaker outlines their thought process and calculations:

1. **Initial Assumptions and Simplifications**: They assume certain terms go to zero as \(s\) approaches infinity, such as \(1/e^{st}\) when multiplied by anything finite.

2. **Equation Setup**: They set up an equation involving the Laplace transform of \(\sin(2t)\), using properties of Laplace transforms and algebraic manipulation:
   - The speaker identifies terms involving \(s\) and constants, leading to expressions like \(4/s^2\).
   - They combine these terms to form a common denominator and simplify.

3. **Final Expression**: After rearranging and simplifying, they find the Laplace transform of \(\sin(2t)\) as:
   \[
   \frac{2}{s^2 + 4}
   \]
   This matches the standard form for the Laplace transform of \(\sin(at)\), which is \(\frac{a}{s^2 + a^2}\).

4. **Reflection**: The speaker acknowledges minor errors in sign during their calculations but confirms that the final result aligns with known results.

5. **Conclusion**: They emphasize the importance of practice in mastering Laplace transforms, acknowledging the initial complexity and potential for mistakes.
