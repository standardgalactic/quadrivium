The text explains how to find the area between two curves by integrating with respect to \(y\), using horizontal approximating rectangles. In this approach, functions are expressed as \(f(y)\) for the right curve and \(g(y)\) for the left curve. The integration limits for \(y\) span from a lower bound \(c\) to an upper bound \(d\). This method simplifies finding the area by integrating the difference \(f(y) - g(y)\) across these vertical boundaries. Understanding this setup makes calculating areas straightforward when dealing with curves defined in terms of \(y\).
