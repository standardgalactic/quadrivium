The text discusses why certain vector fields do not have potential functions by examining their gradients. It starts with a two-dimensional example where the gradient components are analyzed using partial derivatives:

1. **First Example (2D Vector Field):**
   - The component \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 3x^2y \) is given.
   - Integrating this with respect to \( x \), results in a potential function candidate of the form \( f(x, y) = x^3y + g(y) \).
   - The component \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = xy \) is used next. Differentiating \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \), we get \( x^3 + g'(y) \).
   - Setting this equal to \( xy \), leads to a contradiction since \( g'(y) = xy - x^3 \) cannot be solely a function of \( y \). Hence, the vector field does not have a potential function.

2. **Second Example (3D Vector Field):**
   - The gradient is extended to three dimensions with components involving \( x, y, z \).
   - Given \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xyz \), integrating this with respect to \( x \) yields a potential function candidate of the form \( f(x, y, z) = x^2yz + g(y, z) + h(z) \).
   - The text implies that similar steps would be followed for other components (\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \), etc.) to verify if a consistent potential function exists.

Overall, the text illustrates through examples how vector fields are analyzed for potential functions using partial derivatives and integration, highlighting when they fail due to inconsistencies in derived expressions.

The text describes a process of finding a potential function \( f(x, y, z) \) by taking partial derivatives and solving step-by-step. Here’s a summary:

1. **Starting Point**: The speaker begins with the second derivative, focusing on differentiating with respect to \( y \). They note that if a partial derivative is zero, it indicates a constant function.

2. **Partial Derivatives**:
   - Differentiate \( f(x, y, z) \) partially with respect to \( y \), resulting in \( x^2z \).
   - Since there’s no \( y \) term in one part of the function, its derivative with respect to \( y \) is zero.

3. **Solving for Constants**:
   - Recognize that if a partial derivative equals zero, the original function must be a constant.
   - Introduce constants (e.g., \( g(y, z) = C_1 \)) as part of the solution.

4. **Building the Function**:
   - Construct \( f(x, y, z) \) step-by-step by integrating partial derivatives and adding constants.
   - Address each variable separately, ensuring to account for dependencies (e.g., functions of \( y \) and \( z \)).

5. **Final Integration**:
   - Integrate with respect to \( z \) to find \( h(z) = z + C_2 \).
   - Combine all parts to form the complete potential function: \( f(x, y, z) = x^2yz + g(y, z) + h(z) \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Emphasize the importance of keeping track of dependencies and using partial derivatives correctly.
   - Highlight that constants can be integrated separately when they depend on fewer variables.

The process involves careful differentiation and integration to piece together a potential function from its components.

The text appears to be an informal conversation or internal monologue about a misunderstanding related to some calculations, specifically mentioning "plus one" and "minus four." The speaker acknowledges having written something incorrectly but clarifies it doesn't impact the main issue at hand. They dismiss concerns over minor errors as not being significant ("not a lot") and emphasize that the real problem isn't what was initially thought, suggesting it's unrelated to some other factors like truth or a virus. Despite this, they seem reassured by stating "it's okay." The overall tone suggests a casual resolution of a small error without major consequences for their task related to space.

The text explains why certain vector fields do not possess potential functions. It begins by analyzing a two-dimensional gradient field where \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 3x^2 y\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = xy\). Through partial differentiation, it's demonstrated that the function \(g(y)\) derived from integrating with respect to \(x\) depends on \(x\), indicating inconsistency because a potential function should only depend on variables related to its differential. This contradiction shows that the vector field lacks a potential function.

The explanation extends to a three-dimensional scenario where \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xyz\). Here, integrating with respect to \(x\) yields an expression dependent on both \(y\) and \(z\), leading to an additional term \(g(y,z)\) during integration. However, the partial derivatives derived from this setup still do not align consistently across all variables, further illustrating that even in higher dimensions, certain vector fields cannot have potential functions.

Overall, the text uses these examples to illustrate how inconsistencies arise when attempting to derive a single scalar function whose gradient matches the given vector field, thus proving the absence of potential functions for those specific cases.

The text describes a process for finding a potential function \( f(x, y, z) \) through partial derivatives. The speaker explains how to differentiate with respect to specific variables and solve for unknown components by recognizing when functions become constants during differentiation. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Partial Derivatives**: Start with the second die \( f(x, y, z) \) and take the partial derivative with respect to \( y \), which results in \( x^2z \).

2. **Function Behavior**: The function does not depend on \( y \) for some terms, leading those terms' derivatives to be zero because they are constants relative to \( y \).

3. **Identifying Constants**: Since the partial derivative with respect to a variable yields zero, it indicates that part of the function is constant.

4. **Building the Function**:
   - The potential function starts as \( f(x, y, z) = x^2yz + g(y, z) \), where \( g(y, z) \) is initially unknown.
   - By taking another partial derivative with respect to \( z \), it's found that \( dh/dz = 1 \), leading to \( h(z) = z + C_2 \).

5. **Integrating and Constructing**: 
   - Integrate where necessary, such as finding \( h(z) \).
   - Complete the potential function by combining known parts: \( f(x, y, z) = x^2yz + z + C_2 \).

6. **Final Notes**:
   - Pay attention to which variables are involved in each derivative.
   - Remember that functions of multiple variables require careful handling of partial derivatives.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding how to build up a function from its components by taking and interpreting partial derivatives correctly.

The text appears to be a conversation where someone is trying to recall and correct a mistake they made regarding a calculation. They initially thought it was "minus four" but then realized it should be "plus one." The person acknowledges the error without much concern, noting that this specific issue isn't significant or central ("it's not the problem," "it's not the truth"). Additionally, there is some confusion or correction around terms in different languages (such as "発"), which seem to emphasize that the calculation mistake for space is inconsequential. Overall, it reflects a casual conversation about recognizing and correcting an error without stressing its importance.
