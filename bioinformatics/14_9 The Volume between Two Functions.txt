In this video I want to look at a sample problem where we have two separate values.
One above and one below the xy plane.
So we are asked to calculate the volume of the shape above the function
f of x and y is x squared plus y squared minus 2
and below the function f of x and y equals the square root of x squared plus y squared minus 2.
With x squared plus y squared equals 2 as a common base region.
When we look at this figure we'll notice that the function in f with the square root is obviously above the xy plane
and the x squared plus y squared minus 2 is below.
And we'll have to work out two separate volumes.
With the xy plane cutting this shape in 2.
Obviously the function that is below the xy plane will have a negative volume
and we'll have to take the absolute value of that volume and then add it to the top volume.
And I mean top where z is positive.
We also note that it would be easier for us to convert or translate our axes
because we are dealing with a circle.
So first of all the circle for our base, our region that forms the base of both of these shapes.
So we'll construct a vector t and r and theta.
We know that x equals r cosine of theta and y equals to r sine of theta.
And then for our top function then, f1, we'll call it f1 and x and y, which is the square root of 4 minus x squared minus y squared.
I'll replace x with r cosine of theta, y with r sine of theta.
And I'm thus left with this f1 of our vector in r and theta being 4 minus r squared to the power half.
Now look at setting up our first volume.
Be a double integral in r d r d theta.
We've looked at that before.
If we move one step further, you'll note that in this instance we used u substitution.
And I'll show you on the right hand side how that substitution was done.
And that leaves us with a volume 1 of 2 pi times minus 2 times the square root of 2 over 3 plus 8 over 3.
Now let's look at the negative volume below the xy plane.
Again, I'm going to convert or I'm going to translate my axes.
I'm going to replace x and y with again r cosine theta and r sine of theta.
But the volume 2 would be the absolute value of this double integral.
Follow the double integral.
No need for any kind of substitution.
And you'll note that we get to an answer of 2 pi.
I now simply add volume 1 and volume 2.
Volume 2, as I said, was the absolute value.
It was negative 2 pi without the absolute values.
And if we add them you should get 2 pi over 3 times 11 minus 2 square root of 2.
on the perceived value, if we add them, it has an moment where you can get all these 6 paintings.
We have a 3Ã¨me graph.
If I put the house on your right hand side, which of the competing Podcast is nothing else plus I'm worth to use now.
