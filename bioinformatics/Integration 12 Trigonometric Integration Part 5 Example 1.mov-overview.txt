The text provides a step-by-step solution for finding the indefinite integral of \(\sec^4(x) \, dx\). Here's a summary:

1. **Trigonometric Identity**: Use the identity \(\sec^2(x) = 1 + \tan^2(x)\) to rewrite the integrand as \((1 + \tan^2(x)) \cdot \sec^2(x)\).

2. **Substitution**: Let \(u = \tan(x)\), which implies \(du = \sec^2(x) \, dx\). This substitution simplifies the integral to \(\int (1 + u^2) \, du\).

3. **Integration**: Split the integral into two parts: \(\int 1 \, du + \int u^2 \, du\).
   - The first part integrates to \(u\).
   - The second part integrates to \(\frac{u^3}{3}\).

4. **Combine Results**: Combine the results of the integrals to get \(u + \frac{u^3}{3} + C\), where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

5. **Substitute Back**: Replace \(u\) with \(\tan(x)\) to obtain the final result: \(\tan(x) + \frac{\tan^3(x)}{3} + C\).

This process uses a trigonometric substitution and basic integration techniques to solve the integral.
