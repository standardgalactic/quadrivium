The text explains the process of using carbon-14 dating to determine the age of fossils based on radioactive decay principles. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,600 years, which means it takes this time for its concentration in a specimen to reduce by half. The mathematical model used is exponential decay, described by \( y(t) = y_0 \times e^{kt} \), where \( k \) is the decay constant.

To calculate a fossil's age when only one-thousandth of the original carbon-14 remains:

1. **Half-life calculation**: Determine \( k \) using the half-life:
   - After 5,600 years, the concentration halves: 
     \[
     \frac{y_0}{2} = y_0 \times e^{k \cdot 5600}
     \]
   - Simplify to find \( k \):
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 5600k \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5600}
     \]

2. **Age calculation**: For a fossil with one-thousandth of the original carbon-14:
   - Set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{1000} = e^{kt}
     \]
   - Taking natural logs gives:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{1}{1000}\right) = kt
     \]
   - Substitute \( k \):
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(1000)}{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5600}}
     \]

3. **Result**: The calculation yields an approximate age of 55,800 years for the fossil.

The text also notes that carbon-14 dating is effective up to about 100,000 years due to decreasing concentrations over time. Beyond this period, other isotopes with longer half-lives are used, allowing scientists to estimate Earth's age far beyond ancient estimations of a few thousand years.
