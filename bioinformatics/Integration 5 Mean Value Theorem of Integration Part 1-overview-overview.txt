The text explains the Mean Value Theorem for Integration, which is analogous to the Mean Value Theorem in differentiation. This theorem finds the average value of a continuous function \(f(x)\) over a closed interval \([a, b]\). It describes how the definite integral from \(a\) to \(b\) represents the area under the curve on that interval, similar to using Riemann sums with infinitely many rectangles.

Key points include:

- The theorem identifies an average value of the function, denoted as \(f(c)\), where \(c\) is a point within \([a, b]\).
- This average value is calculated by dividing the definite integral by the interval length (\(b-a\)).
- Geometrically, it states that there exists a point \(c\) such that a rectangle with base width \(b-a\) and height \(f(c)\) has an area equal to the area under the curve from \(a\) to \(b\).

In summary, the Mean Value Theorem for Integration equates the average value of a function over an interval to a specific function value at some point within that interval.
