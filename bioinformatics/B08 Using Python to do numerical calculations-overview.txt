The text discusses using software for numerical methods instead of manual calculations. It suggests leveraging spreadsheet tools like Microsoft Excel or programming languages such as MATLAB, Python, or C#. For those familiar with object-oriented programming, these options are straightforward.

The author plans to demonstrate using Python on a Mac, specifically version 2.7.5, which is pre-installed on Mac Mavericks. However, they note that newer versions of Python (up to 3.3) exist, bringing changes and possibly easier features, but with some compatibility issues for older add-ons.

The text highlights the power of Python due to its extensive package ecosystem, despite not being a single contained program. For Windows users on modern systems like Windows 7 or 8, it's recommended to install the 32-bit version of Python because many packages are still compatible only with 32-bit systems.
