The text provides an overview of solving second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients through two example problems.

1. **First Problem (Overdamped System):**
   - The equation is homogeneous and has constant coefficients.
   - The auxiliary equation \( m^2 + 5m + 4 = 0 \) is derived from the differential form, solving to give roots \( m_1 = -4 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).
   - The general solution is \( x(t) = c_1 e^{-4t} + c_2 e^{-t} \).
   - Initial conditions are applied: \( x(0) = 1 \) and \( x'(0) = 1 \), leading to the system of equations for constants:
     - \( c_1 + c_2 = 1 \)
     - \( -4c_1 - c_2 = 1 \)
   - Solving these gives \( c_1 = -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( c_2 = \frac{5}{3} \).
   - The specific solution is \( x(t) = -\frac{2}{3} e^{-4t} + \frac{5}{3} e^{-t} \).

2. **Second Problem (Critically Damped System):**
   - The differential form leads to the auxiliary equation \( m^2 + 8m + 16 = 0 \), which factors as \( (m + 4)^2 = 0 \).
   - This gives a repeated root \( m_1 = m_2 = -4 \).
   - The general solution is \( x(t) = c_1 e^{-4t} + c_2 te^{-4t} \).
   - Initial conditions are: \( x(0) = 0 \) and \( x'(0) = -3 \), resulting in:
     - \( c_1 = 0 \)
     - Solving for \( c_2 \) using the derivative gives \( c_2 = -3 \).
   - The specific solution is \( x(t) = -3te^{-4t} \).

The text concludes by mentioning that the next topic will involve solving problems with complex numbers.
