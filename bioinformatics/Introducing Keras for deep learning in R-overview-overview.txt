This tutorial introduces the use of the Keras package in R for healthcare professionals interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, specifically deep neural networks. It emphasizes the significance of AI knowledge in modern medical research and encourages practitioners to acquire skills in both computer science and healthcare.

The guide starts by setting up the working environment in R Studio, including importing necessary packages like Keras, with additional installation details available on keras.rstudio.com. The tutorial uses a pre-cleaned dataset from UC Irvine, which includes 2,126 samples of fetal cardiac monitoring data with 21 features and one target variable categorized into three classes: normal, suspect, or pathologic.

Key steps in the tutorial include:
- Loading and processing the CSV file into an R dataframe and converting it to a matrix.
- Adjusting target classes for one-hot encoding preparation.
- Splitting the dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) sets using R's sample function.
- Preparing feature matrices and target vectors with Kerasâ€™s `to_categorical` function.

The tutorial demonstrates building and evaluating a neural network model:
1. **Data Preparation:** Applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables, followed by normalization using the mean and standard deviation from the training set.
2. **Model Creation:** Constructing a sequential model in Keras with dense layers, ReLU activations, dropout for regularization, and a softmax output layer.
3. **Model Compilation:** Using categorical cross-entropy loss, 'adam' optimizer, and accuracy as metrics.
4. **Training:** Training the model on 20 epochs with a mini-batch size of 64 and a validation split of 20% to monitor overfitting.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using test data, achieving about 89% accuracy, complemented by a confusion matrix for detailed analysis.

The tutorial emphasizes the importance of learning R Studio, Keras, and TensorFlow for healthcare researchers to enhance their capabilities in AI applications. It also highlights best practices like proper normalization and regularization in machine learning. Additionally, it introduces using probability predictions with `predict_prob` in R-Studio to assess class probabilities effectively. The overall message encourages embracing these technologies for better insights and advancements in healthcare research.
