This video discusses the recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) and superior laryngeal nerve, highlighting their roles in laryngeal functions such as swallowing, breathing, coughing, and phonation. The RLNs originate from the vagus nerve, with distinct anatomical paths on each side: the left RLN loops under the aortic arch while the right one wraps around the subclavian artery. Anomalies like a non-recurrent right RLN can occur, often linked to an anomalous right subclavian artery.

The RLNs enter the larynx deep to the inferior constrictor muscle and posterior to the cricothyroid joint, innervating muscles for vocal cord movement. Injury mechanisms include thermal damage, cutting, stretching, compression, or vascular compromise, with higher risks during thyroidectomy due to factors like malignancy, previous surgeries, or local scarring.

Complications of RLN injury can vary from temporary to permanent paralysis, though most cases recover. Risk management includes nerve identification, possibly using intraoperative monitoring, evaluating vocal cord function preoperatively, and ensuring informed patient consent. Non-surgical causes of RLN paralysis include tumors and intubation-related trauma.

The superior laryngeal nerve divides into sensory and motor branches, with the latter crucial for voice quality by innervating the cricothyroid muscle. Damage can occur if the superior thyroid artery is improperly ligated during surgery.
