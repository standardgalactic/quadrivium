This video discusses the recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) and superior laryngeal nerve, highlighting their roles in laryngeal functions such as swallowing, breathing, coughing, and phonation. The RLNs originate from the vagus nerve, with distinct anatomical paths on each side: the left RLN loops under the aortic arch while the right one wraps around the subclavian artery. Anomalies like a non-recurrent right RLN can occur, often linked to an anomalous right subclavian artery.

The RLNs enter the larynx deep to the inferior constrictor muscle and posterior to the cricothyroid joint, innervating muscles for vocal cord movement. Injury mechanisms include thermal damage, cutting, stretching, compression, or vascular compromise, with higher risks during thyroidectomy due to factors like malignancy, previous surgeries, or local scarring.

Complications of RLN injury can vary from temporary to permanent paralysis, though most cases recover. Risk management includes nerve identification, possibly using intraoperative monitoring, evaluating vocal cord function preoperatively, and ensuring informed patient consent. Non-surgical causes of RLN paralysis include tumors and intubation-related trauma.

The superior laryngeal nerve divides into sensory and motor branches, with the latter crucial for voice quality by innervating the cricothyroid muscle. Damage can occur if the superior thyroid artery is improperly ligated during surgery.

This video discusses the anatomy and clinical significance of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and superior laryngeal nerve, both critical for laryngeal function in swallowing, breathing, coughing, and phonation.

### Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve:
- **Anatomy**: The RLN is a branch of the vagus nerve. On the left, it loops under the aortic arch, while on the right, it wraps around the subclavian artery before ascending between the trachea and esophagus.
  - It measures approximately 12 cm on the left and 5-6 cm on the right.
  - In about 1% of people, there is a non-recurrent right RLN that doesn't loop but instead runs in an anomalous position due to an aberrant subclavian artery.
- **Function**: The nerve enters the larynx deep to the inferior constrictor muscle and posterior to the cricothyroid joint. It divides into sensory and motor branches, innervating the posterior arytenoid muscle for vocal cord abduction.
- **Injury Mechanisms**: Injury can occur due to surgery (thermal damage, stretching, cutting, compression), leading to vocal cord impairment. Surgical risk factors include older age, thyroid malignancy, non-identification of the nerve, scarring from previous conditions or surgeries, and extensive surgical procedures like lymphadenectomy.
  - Approximately 1% have permanent post-operative paralysis, while 2.5% to 6% experience temporary paralysis, with up to 90% recovering.

### Superior Laryngeal Nerve:
- **Anatomy**: It separates from the vagus at the skull base and descends along the internal carotid artery, dividing into sensory (innervating the larynx) and motor branches. The external branch innervates the cricothyroid muscle.
- **Injury Mechanisms**: Damage occurs if the superior thyroid artery is ligated too far from the thyroid pole, affecting voice quality and strength.

### Considerations for Nerve Injury:
1. **Identification and Monitoring**: Always identify nerves during surgery to minimize injury risk. Intraoperative monitoring with a laryngoscope can help visualize vocal cords.
2. **Preoperative Evaluation**: Assess vocal cord function pre-surgery, though this involves additional costs.
3. **Informed Consent**: Inform patients about potential complications like nerve paralysis.
4. **Post-operative Management**: Involve ENT specialists for managing or repairing nerve injuries when needed.

### Non-Surgical Causes of Nerve Paralysis:
- **Non-Laryngeal Tumors**: 20-30% of cases, with 40% due to thyroid malignancies.
- **Endotracheal Intubation**: Accounts for 7-10% of paralysis due to various factors like compression or infection post-trauma.

This summary underscores the importance of understanding laryngeal nerve anatomy and injury mechanisms to optimize surgical outcomes and manage complications effectively.
