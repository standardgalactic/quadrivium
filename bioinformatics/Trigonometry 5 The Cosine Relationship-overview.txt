The text provides a geometrical explanation of the law of cosines, using a specific figure for illustration. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup and Definitions**: The figure involves angles and sides where \( x = a \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = a \sin(\theta) \). These are derived from the cosine and sine definitions based on angle \(\theta\).

2. **Pythagorean Application**: Using the Pythagorean theorem, we aim to find side \( c \). The text discusses calculating the distance between two points using their coordinates.

3. **Distance Calculation**: For a hypothetical scenario where \( x = -3 \) and \( b = 4 \), the distance is calculated as \( |x| + b = 7 \). This can also be computed by subtracting \( x \) from \( b \).

4. **Expression for \( c^2 \)**: The expression for \( c^2 \) involves squaring the difference between \( x \) and \( b \), plus \( y^2 \). Substituting known values, we derive:
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 \cos^2(\theta) - 2ab \cos(\theta) + b^2 + a^2 \sin^2(\theta)
   \]

5. **Simplification**: By factoring and using the identity \( \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1 \), the expression simplifies to:
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(\theta)
   \]
   This is the law of cosines.

The text concludes with some unclear, possibly corrupted statements, but the core explanation revolves around deriving and understanding the law of cosines through geometric reasoning.
