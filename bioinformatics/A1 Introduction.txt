My name is Jean Club and I'm a Surgeon at the Acute Care Surgery Unit at Grootiskeer
Hospital in Cape Town. One of my favorite topics is that of differential equations.
It has so many applications in real life situations. But how do you learn differential equations?
While many textbooks start off with applying differential equations to some of these real
life problems, but that creates two issues. Number one, you might not be familiar with
differential equations or the clinical or biological or real life scenarios that they
apply to in these textbooks. So what I'm going to do is to start off with some of the basic
mathematics, solve some differential equations, and give you some examples to work with. Now what
are we going to discuss? We'll look at separable variable problems, some of the easiest differential
equations to solve. Then we'll move on to linear equations, exact equations, solutions by substitutions,
and finally the numerical method. Let's have a look.
