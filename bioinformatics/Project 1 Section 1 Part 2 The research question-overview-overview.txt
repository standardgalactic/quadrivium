The text describes a hypothetical medical research project intended for educational purposes, focusing on patients with skin or soft tissue infections related to diabetes mellitus. These infections are classified into minor and major categories based on whether they require oral antibiotics or more intensive treatments like intravenous antibiotics or surgery. The study aims to compare admission HbA1c levels (indicative of blood sugar control) and CRP levels (a marker for inflammation) between these two groups.

The emphasis is on understanding trends in CRP values rather than their absolute numbers, as these can guide treatment adjustments. This project serves as an introduction to research processes such as defining variables, forming comparative groups, and data analysis. It also underscores the importance of formulating clinical questions during patient care, while noting that this model is overly simplified for educational use. The next step in the project involves reviewing existing literature on similar topics.
