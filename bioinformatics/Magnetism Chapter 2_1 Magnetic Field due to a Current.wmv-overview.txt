The text discusses calculating magnetic fields due to currents in wires, focusing on a principle called the Biot-Savart Law. This law describes how a moving charged particle or current-carrying wire generates a magnetic field. The formula involves parameters such as the permeability constant (\(\mu_0\)), current (I), differential length element (ds), and the angle (\(\phi\)) between these vectors, with the magnetic field decreasing with the square of the distance from the wire.

The text emphasizes using vector mathematics and the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field. It applies this understanding to a specific example: calculating the magnetic field at point C due to a current in a semicircular wire. The integration process is simplified because the radius remains constant for all points on the arc, allowing the calculation of the magnetic field's magnitude.

Finally, the text introduces the right-hand thumb rule as a method for determining the direction of the magnetic field: if you curl your fingers in the direction of current flow with your thumb pointing along the wire, your fingers indicate the direction of the magnetic field at a point around the wire. For a semicircle centered on point C, this means the magnetic field is directed outwards from the plane of the board.
