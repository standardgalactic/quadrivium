The text discusses calculating magnetic fields due to currents in wires, focusing on a principle called the Biot-Savart Law. This law describes how a moving charged particle or current-carrying wire generates a magnetic field. The formula involves parameters such as the permeability constant (\(\mu_0\)), current (I), differential length element (ds), and the angle (\(\phi\)) between these vectors, with the magnetic field decreasing with the square of the distance from the wire.

The text emphasizes using vector mathematics and the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field. It applies this understanding to a specific example: calculating the magnetic field at point C due to a current in a semicircular wire. The integration process is simplified because the radius remains constant for all points on the arc, allowing the calculation of the magnetic field's magnitude.

Finally, the text introduces the right-hand thumb rule as a method for determining the direction of the magnetic field: if you curl your fingers in the direction of current flow with your thumb pointing along the wire, your fingers indicate the direction of the magnetic field at a point around the wire. For a semicircle centered on point C, this means the magnetic field is directed outwards from the plane of the board.

The text discusses calculating magnetic fields due to a current using the Biot-Savart Law, also referred to here as the "law of Bjorn and Savard." This law relates to how moving charged particles (like those in an electric current) generate magnetic fields. The key components involve:

1. **Biot-Savart Law**: It calculates the differential magnetic field (\(dB\)) at a point \(P\) due to a small segment of current-carrying wire. The equation involves:
   - \(\mu_0\), the permeability constant (\(4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A}\)).
   - Current (\(I\)).
   - A differential length element (\(dS\)) of the wire.
   - The sine of the angle between \(dS\) and the vector pointing from the wire segment to point \(P\).
   - Distance squared from the wire segment to point \(P\).

2. **Integration for Total Magnetic Field**: For a complete current-carrying loop or arc, you integrate these differential contributions over the entire path of the current.

3. **Simplified Case with Circular Arc**: The text considers calculating the magnetic field at the center of a semicircular wire carrying current:
   - If \(C\) is at the center, the radius vector (\(R\)) is constant in magnitude.
   - \(\theta = 90^\circ\), simplifying calculations.
   - Integration over the arc length involves substituting \(ds = r \, d\phi\).

4. **Right-Hand Rule**: Used to determine the direction of the magnetic field:
   - Thumb points in the direction of current.
   - Fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines.

For a complete circular loop, the resultant magnetic field at the center is directed out of or into the plane of the loop, depending on the direction of the current, and its magnitude simplifies to \(\frac{\mu_0 I}{2r}\). The right-hand rule helps confirm this directionality.
