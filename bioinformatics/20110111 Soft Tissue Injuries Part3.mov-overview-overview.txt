Rhabdomyolysis is a condition characterized by muscle tissue breakdown and release of its contents into the bloodstream, caused by factors such as trauma (e.g., injuries, burns), excessive muscular activity, alcohol intoxication, toxins like certain pharmaceuticals, infections, connective tissue disorders, and sickle cell anemia. The pathophysiology involves disruption in sodium-potassium balance and calcium homeostasis due to events like trauma or ischemia, leading to muscle cell damage through biochemical pathways.

Trauma can cause stretch-activated channels to open, resulting in sodium and calcium influx, causing cell swelling and damage. Ischemia reduces ATP production, worsening the condition by increasing intracellular calcium. Upon reperfusion, activated neutrophils release harmful substances that intensify muscle damage, creating a cycle of ischemia and cell lysis.

Systemic effects include crush syndrome with hyperkalemia, acidemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and myoglobinuria, potentially leading to kidney damage. Crush syndrome is particularly severe, causing systemic issues like hyperkalemic shock and can lead to complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and platelet consumption due to metabolic derangements post-reperfusion. Hyperphosphatemia further exacerbates hypocalcemia by decreasing vitamin D production and promoting metastatic calcification. Hyperkalemic cardiotoxicity is a significant early cause of death following severe trauma-related injuries.
