The text outlines solving an optimization problem using Lagrange multipliers, which is used to find maximum or minimum values of functions subject to constraints:

1. **Lagrange Multiplier Method**: 
   - The method involves an objective function \( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + xy + y^2 + yz + z^2 \).
   - The constraint is given by \( g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0 \), representing a sphere.
   - Gradients of both functions are calculated to set up the equations \( \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g \).
   - These equations provide relationships between variables and help solve for \( x, y, z, \) and \( \lambda \).

2. **Solving the Equations**:
   - The system of equations is solved step-by-step by substituting expressions derived from one equation into another.
   - The constraint equation \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \) is used to find specific values for \( x, y, \) and \( z \).
   - Solutions are substituted back into the original function to determine maximum or minimum values.

3. **Application to a Real-World Problem**:
   - An example involves designing a cylindrical tank with a volume constraint of 1000 cubic meters.
   - Different costs for materials used in different parts of the cylinder (top/bottom vs. side) are considered.
   - The objective is to minimize the cost while satisfying the volume requirement.

This explanation shows how Lagrange multipliers can be applied to practical problems, like optimizing material usage and costs in manufacturing scenarios.

The text outlines an optimization problem for designing a cylinder to achieve a specified volume while minimizing material costs. The key points are as follows:

1. **Volume Constraint**: The volume \( V \) of the cylinder is defined by the equation \( \pi r^2 h = 1000 \).

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The total cost involves two parts: 
     - The top and bottom surfaces, costing $2 per square meter, with an area of \( 4\pi r^2 \).
     - The side surface, costing $2.50 per square meter, with an area of \( 5\pi rh \).

3. **Optimization Objective**: Use Lagrange multipliers to minimize the cost function \( C = 4\pi r^2 + 5\pi rh \) subject to the volume constraint.

4. **Gradient Equations**:
   - For radius: \( 8\pi r + 5\pi h = 2\lambda \pi rh \).
   - For height: \( 5\pi r = \lambda \pi r^2 \).

5. **Solving for Dimensions**: 
   - Simplifying the gradient equations gives a relationship between radius and height: \( r = \frac{5}{8}h \).
   - Substitute this ratio into the volume constraint to find specific dimensions that minimize costs.

The text illustrates how constrained optimization is applied to real-world problems, balancing the need for a fixed volume with cost minimization. By solving these equations, one can determine the optimal dimensions of the cylinder that satisfy both constraints.
