The text provides strategies for handling indeterminate forms in calculus, particularly those involving infinity, zero, or logarithms. Here’s a summary:

### Key Strategies

1. **Identifying Indeterminate Forms**: Recognize forms like \( \frac{0}{0} \), \( \infty - \infty \), \( 0 \times \infty \), \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \), \( 0^0 \), \( \infty^0 \), and \( 1^\infty \).

2. **L'Hôpital's Rule**: Useful for limits resulting in \( \frac{0}{0} \) or \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \). It involves differentiating the numerator and denominator until a determinate form is achieved.

3. **Algebraic Manipulation**: Simplify expressions by combining, factoring, expanding, or using common denominators to resolve indeterminate forms.

4. **Multiplying by Conjugates/Equivalent Expressions**: Use conjugates or expressions equivalent to 1 (like \( \frac{a+b}{a+b} \)) for simplification, especially with square roots or complex fractions.

5. **Rewriting Products and Quotients**: Convert products into quotients or vice versa to simplify calculations.

6. **Logarithmic Differentiation**: Simplify differentiation of products, powers, or roots by taking the natural logarithm of both sides.

7. **Series Expansion**: Use Taylor or Maclaurin series expansions for approximating functions and evaluating limits.

8. **Special Limits and Theorems**: Apply known limits like \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1 \) or the Squeeze Theorem when applicable.

9. **Exploring Multiple Approaches**: If one method fails, try another approach, often involving clever algebraic manipulations.

10. **Directional Limits**: Consider left-hand and right-hand limits for functions with different behaviors on either side of a point.

### Logarithmic Transformation Technique

- **Problem Context**: Useful for difficult limits involving forms like \( \infty^0 \), \( 0^\infty \), or indeterminate forms.
  
- **Steps**:
  - Introduce a new variable \( y = f(x) \).
  - Take the natural logarithm: \( \ln(y) \).
  - Simplify and apply L'Hôpital’s Rule if needed.
  - Back-transform by exponentiating to find \( y \).

### Example Problems

1. **Example**: \( \lim_{t \to \infty} (t+1)^{2/t} \)
   - Set \( y = (t+1)^{2/t} \).
   - Take the natural log: \( \ln(y) = \frac{2}{t} \ln(t+1) \).
   - Use L'Hôpital’s Rule to find \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \ln(y) = 0 \).
   - Thus, \( \lim_{t \to \infty} y = e^0 = 1 \).

2. **Example**: \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} x^{x^2} \)
   - Set \( y = x^{x^2} \).
   - Take the natural log: \( \ln(y) = x^2 \ln(x) \).
   - Simplify using transformations and L'Hôpital’s Rule to find \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} \ln(y) = 0 \).
   - Thus, \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} y = e^0 = 1 \).

### Conclusion

These strategies are essential for solving complex limits in calculus. Mastery involves understanding logarithmic properties and L'Hôpital's Rule, along with practice in recognizing when to apply these methods.
