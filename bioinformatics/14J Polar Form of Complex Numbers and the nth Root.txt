Now we want to use complex numbers to look at the nth root.
So if n equals 2, that means the square root.
If n equals 5, it's the fifth root of a number.
To do that, we need to express a complex number in polar form.
Then we have it in the form x plus iy, which would be a plus bi.
If we write x and y, don't we put the y in front of the i there.
And now we've drawn it on the complex coordinate plane there.
Argon diagram in as much as we have the real axis, x.
And we have the complex axis in y.
And it makes an angle of theta.
An angle of theta with the positive real axis.
With the positive real axis.
If we now just draw on our knowledge of trigonometry,
and we will call this x, and we will call this y,
that distance, so remember we can write the complex number as an ordered pair, x and y there.
Okay, let's just look at the cosine of theta.
The cosine of theta, that is going to be adjacent, which is x, divided by hypotenuse, which is z.
But, we remember what the modulus of z is, because it's not z that we're looking at.
We're looking at its magnitude, its length.
The modulus of z, that was going to be the square root of, in our case now,
x squared plus y squared, as opposed to a squared plus b squared.
So, we're looking at, we're going to call this r.
The modulus of z, we're going to call r.
So, that is going to be x over r.
In other words, x equals r cosine of theta.
We can also look at the sine of theta.
So, that is going to be y over the modulus of,
y over the modulus of z, which we've denoted as r.
In other words, we can express y as r sine of theta.
In other words, I can rewrite z.
I can rewrite z as x plus y.
So, that's r cosine of theta plus i times y, which is r sine of theta.
I can take this out as a common factor, this r,
and I'm left with the cosine of theta plus i times the sine of theta.
And that is the polar form of this complex number.
The z and z, these, this, this, two identical ways of writing this.
Now, theta is called the argument of z.
The argument of z.
And it is this angle that it makes with the positive axis.
But that number is not unique, remember.
I can rotate it through one more revolution.
So, I can now add theta plus, plus two pi.
That is again going to give me the argument of z.
It's another argument of z.
And in actual fact, I can just add any scalar multiple of two pi.
And I'll denote that with k and k as a positive integer.
It's going to give me an argument of the complex number z.
There is a principle, a principle argument, though,
and that is written theta, and that is unique as argument of z,
with a capital A.
And that means we'll let negative pi smaller than theta,
smaller than equal to pi.
If we let theta be in that range,
so it can only be in this range,
we'll look at perhaps between the end of the day.
But if we constrain it to those values,
there is the principle argument of z.
Now, let's express z equals 1 plus square root of 3i in polar form.
The polar form of this complex number.
First, we need the modulus of z.
That equals r.
That's going to be the square root of 1 squared plus square root of 3 squared.
It's my a and b in the old days.
x and y now.
Which is going to give me 1 plus z is 4,
square root of 4 equals 2.
Let's get the principle argument of z now.
Let's just do the cosine of theta.
That is going to be, remember, x over r.
x is 1, r is 2,
and in other words, theta equals the r cosine or inverse cosine of a half.
When is that true?
Well, you've got to remember your triangles,
and let's remember pi over 3.
That will be 1, 2, squared root of 3.
So cosine of pi over 3 is 1 over 2.
So that equals pi over 3.
Pi over 3.
And now that is my polar form.
I do know r,
and I do know my principal argument.
In other words, z equals,
it's going to be r,
which is 2 times
the cosine of pi over 3
plus i times the sine of pi over 3.
And if you would multiply these out,
get those values half,
and that one would be
square root of 3 over 2.
And you do that,
you're going to be back.
You're going to be back exactly where you started.
So this is the polar form
of this complex number.
Now we've got to express this complex number
in its polar form,
and it's a bit more difficult
than the previous example.
And I've done this,
which you might recognize,
but let's go through that.
First, let's just get r,
which is the modulus of z,
which is going to be
the square root of
negative 1 squared
plus another negative 1 squared,
and as much as that's negative 1,
that's negative 1,
that is the square root of 2.
Square root of 2.
Let's just write x,
so we know x is going to be negative 1,
and y is going to be negative 1.
x is negative 1,
and y is negative 1.
Good.
Now, let's get the cosine of theta,
that is going to be x divided by r.
In other words,
that is going to be x is negative 1
over square root of 2.
In other words,
we've got to have here
theta equals the r cosine,
the r cosine of a negative value,
of a negative value.
And the sine of theta,
because these theta's
must be the same, remember,
that is going to equal
also negative 1
over the square root of 2,
and now the theta
has also got to
be the r sine of
negative 1
over the square root of 2.
Negative 1
over the square root of 2.
So, for both of these
to be satisfying
the same angle,
theta,
we've got to see
where on our,
now that is just a
Cartesian coordinate system
on x and y.
Forget about
being the real
and imaginary axis,
that's x and y.
And remember,
any angle in the first,
in this first quadrant,
both sine and cosine
would be positive.
If we have an angle,
and I'm talking about
an angle with the
positive x axis,
if I have a vector here
or a line here,
and it's the angle
to there,
so it's an angle
from 90 to 180 degrees,
only sine values
of those angles
will be positive.
In the third quadrant,
both sine and cosine
are negative.
Negative.
And remember,
if this was our line here,
this would now be our angle
because we want to constrain,
we'd want to constrain
theta to be less than pi
or less than pi,
less than equal to
negative pi pi.
Okay.
So this will be negative.
This will be negative.
our angle there.
Okay.
And then,
in quadrant four,
only cosine angles
are positive.
So you can remember
that sines are positive
for positive y values
and the cosine is positive
for positive x values.
And you can remember
that cosine goes with x
and sine goes with y.
It would be a way to,
as opposed to remember.
Now, let's just figure out
which angle will
satisfy this for us.
If we just remember
our, let's remember
our angle
pi over four,
which means
that will also be
pi over four,
that's one,
one square root of two.
In other words,
it seems as if we take,
if we take the cosine of,
the cosine of pi over four,
45 degrees,
pi over four,
that is going to be
one over square root of two.
So certainly,
certainly that helps us.
That helps us.
But remember,
that will be this angle.
That will be this angle.
And that gives us
a positive one over square root of two.
But we certainly want
minus one over square root of two.
So we certainly think,
well,
cosine is negative here.
Cosine is negative here.
So if I say
pi minus pi over four,
that means
three pi over four.
I'm talking about
this angle here.
So for that angle,
certainly cosine
is going to be negative.
But I need something
for which sine
will also be negative.
So it's going to be here.
So we've got to be talking there.
And the only way
that that is going to happen
is if we just reflect this
on the x axis,
bringing this down,
making this minus,
minus 135 degrees,
which is minus
three pi over four.
Minus three pi over four
will satisfy both of these
to the same angle.
Minus 135.
The cosine of minus 135
is negative one
over square root of two.
The cosine of negative three
over four
is going to be that.
Cosine is positive here again.
So if I made this minus,
if I had this a minus,
this is also going to be
one over square root of two.
And you can just think
of being cos in there
will again be pi minus this,
which is that.
But now we're dealing
with the negative side.
So in the end,
the z is going to equal r,
which is the square root of two
times the cosine
of negative three pi over four
plus i times the sine
of negative three pi over four.
Okay, so a bit more complex
and you need to know
and understand
when the angles
have positive
and negative values
in as much as
this is going to be
positive
and this is going to be,
if it goes this way around,
it's going to be negative
and noting when we can get there
and in which quadrants
these are positive.
These trigonometric functions
are positive.
all the angles,
the trigonometric functions
of these angles
are in the positive
or negative.
Now we know how to multiply
and divide complex numbers
if they're on the form
a equals x plus i y
or yi.
But how can we do this
if we have them
in polar form?
It's very simple to do.
Let's do z1, z2.
This is going to be r1, r2
and now we're going to have
this multiplied,
this multiplied by that,
which is going to leave us with,
which is going to leave us with
cosine theta 1,
cosine theta 2
plus i times cosine theta 1,
sine theta 2
plus we can have
i sine theta 1,
cosine theta 2
plus i squared,
which means it minus 1,
so minus sine theta 1,
sine theta 2.
And we can combine these two,
so it's cosine theta 1,
cosine theta 2
minus sine theta 1,
sine theta 2,
which you'll see up there
as those two trigonometric identities.
So we can rewrite this as
r1, r2 times,
we can then rewrite these two as,
these two you'll see,
note up there,
so that's the cosine of
theta 1 plus theta 2.
And we're going to have,
we can take out i as a common factor
and we'll have these two added together,
which gives us that,
which is plus i times
the sine of,
let's write it like that,
i times the sine of
theta 1 plus theta 2.
So that's one way,
that is an equation
that you can know for,
for,
the multiplication of two complex numbers
if they are on polar 4.
And you can do this
if you know the proper identities
for z1 divided by z2.
Seeing that z2 must not be zero,
but it's going to be r1 divided by r2.
And here we're going to have
the cosine of theta 1 minus,
minus theta 2.
And we're going to have plus i,
we're going to have sine of
theta 1 minus theta 2.
Okay.
So those are the two equations
for multiplication
and the division of two complex numbers
if you have the polar format.
The last thing that you need to know
is that
if we take the modulus of z1
divided by z2,
that is the same as the modulus of z1
divided by the modulus of z2.
z2 if z2 does not equal zero.
So we have that.
And then the argument,
the argument of z1 divided by z2,
that is going to be the argument of z1
minus the argument of z2.
You might see some problems
where that's the 1, 2, 3, 4 equations
that you should know.
