The text emphasizes the importance of risk stratification and managing endocrine disorders, particularly diabetes, in surgical patients. It highlights that hyperglycemia, even in non-diabetic individuals, can lead to adverse surgical outcomes, such as high infection rates, compromised wound healing, ischemic complications, prolonged hospital stays, undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, and increased thrombotic events.

For diabetic patients, there is debate over how tightly glucose levels should be controlled before and after surgery. Generally, oral diabetes medications are stopped, and insulin therapy is managed on a sliding scale or with insulin infusions in well-trained settings. The text also advises considering the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during critical illness, suggesting hydrocortisone use as per the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines to improve response to catecholamines.

Regarding hematology, anemia and coagulation status are crucial preoperative considerations. Anemia management aims to preserve physiological reserve and oxygen-carrying capacity, with transfusions indicated only when a patient cannot compensate for low hematocrit levels. The TRIC trial suggests that stable patients with a hematocrit below 7 should be transfused, while those between 7 and 10 are evaluated based on their ability to maintain oxygen flux. Patients with known cardiovascular issues may require transfusion even at lower levels, whereas those with a hematocrit above 10 typically do not need it.

The text warns of risks associated with transfusions, including allergic reactions, fluid overload, and an increased risk of bacterial infections post-surgery, as reported in recent studies published in the BMJ.
