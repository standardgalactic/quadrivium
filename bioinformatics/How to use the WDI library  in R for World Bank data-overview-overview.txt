The text provides a comprehensive tutorial on using the R package `WDI` (World Bank Data API library) to access and analyze open data from the World Bank, focusing particularly on maternal mortality ratios. Here's a summary:

1. **Overview**: The walkthrough guides users through accessing World Bank indicators via the WDI package in R. Topics covered include agriculture, aid effectiveness, climate change, and economic growth.

2. **R Environment Setup**: It outlines setting up an R environment using Markdown for analysis with packages like `WDI` for data extraction, `Plotly` for graphing, and `Deedle` for data frames. Configuration steps include setting file paths and working directories, along with CSS styling.

3. **Data Access**:
   - Users can search for specific indicators by name or country code using the function `WDI::search`.
   - An example demonstrates retrieving maternal mortality ratio data for the United States (US), Brazil (BR), and South Africa (ZA) from 2005 to 2015 with `WDI::wdi`.
   - The tutorial emphasizes fetching only essential variables by setting `extra = FALSE`, but mentions additional metadata is available if set to TRUE.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - It includes instructions for examining the data frame within RStudio.
   - Additional metadata, such as ISO 3C codes and country-specific details, can be accessed with specific search parameters.

5. **Visualization**:
   - The tutorial guides users on creating interactive plots using `leaflet` for maps and `Plotly` for graphs.
   - Data filtering is done via the `dplyr` package to focus on Brazil, USA, and South Africa.
   - A Plotly graph visualizes maternal mortality rates from 2005 to 2015 with customizations like scatter plots, titles, and axis labels.

6. **Interactive Features**: The final plot allows users to interact by hovering over data points for specific values. It highlights a decline in South Africa's maternal mortality rates around 2010-2011.

7. **Further Exploration**: Resources are suggested for further exploration of the WDI package and issues related to maternal health in South Africa. 

Overall, this tutorial is aimed at users interested in using R to analyze and visualize World Bank data with a focus on maternal mortality metrics.
