The lecture covers evaluating diagnostic tests using several key metrics: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and odds ratios. 

- **Sensitivity** measures the test's ability to correctly identify patients with a disease, calculated as true positives divided by total diseased cases.
  
- **Specificity** assesses how well the test identifies non-diseased individuals, calculated as true negatives divided by total non-diseased cases.

- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)** indicates the likelihood that someone who tests positive actually has the disease, determined by dividing true positives by all positive results.

- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)** reflects the probability that someone testing negative is truly free of the disease, calculated as true negatives divided by all negative results.

An example with 1,000 patients shows a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 90%, PPV of 51.4%, and NPV of 99.4%. The test effectively rules out the disease when negative but is less reliable for confirming it when positive.

Additionally, odds ratios are introduced as a method to compare outcomes between two groups with differing interventions. The formula \( \frac{A}{C} \times \frac{D}{B} \) is used, where A, B, C, and D represent the number of specific outcomes in each group.
