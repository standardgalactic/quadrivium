The text discusses calculating the volume of a shape defined by two surfaces in three-dimensional space. The problem involves finding the volume above one function and below another, with both functions sharing a circular base region given by \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\).

1. **Functions and Setup**:
   - The lower surface is described by \(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2\), which lies below the xy-plane.
   - The upper surface is defined as \(f(x, y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 2\).
   - Since we are dealing with circular symmetry, it's convenient to convert to polar coordinates where \(x = r \cos(\theta)\) and \(y = r \sin(\theta)\).

2. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The task involves calculating two separate volumes: one above the xy-plane and another below it.
   - For the volume above the xy-plane, denoted as Volume 1, a double integral in polar coordinates is used. Through integration, this results in \(2\pi \left(-2\sqrt{2}/3 + 8/3\right)\).
   - For the volume below the xy-plane (Volume 2), another double integral is set up and evaluated to yield \(2\pi\). Since this volume is negative due to its position relative to the xy-plane, its absolute value is considered.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The total volume is obtained by adding the absolute values of Volume 1 and Volume 2.
   - The resulting combined volume is expressed as \(\frac{2\pi}{3} (11 - 2\sqrt{2})\).

The approach highlights the use of polar coordinates to simplify integration over a circular base, demonstrating techniques such as u-substitution for evaluating integrals.

The text describes solving a problem involving calculating the volume of two separate regions in three-dimensional space. These regions are defined by functions and lie above and below the xy-plane, with a common base region described by \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\). The function above the plane is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 2}\), and the one below is \(x^2 + y^2 - 2\).

To solve this problem:
1. Convert to polar coordinates for easier integration, using \(x = r \cos \theta\) and \(y = r \sin \theta\).
2. The base region becomes a circle with radius \(\sqrt{2}\).
3. Calculate the volume above the xy-plane by setting up and evaluating a double integral in polar coordinates.
4. Use substitution to simplify this integration, resulting in Volume 1: \(2\pi \left(-2\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} + \frac{8}{3}\right)\).
5. For the volume below the xy-plane, set up another double integral and compute it directly (since no substitution is needed), obtaining Volume 2 as the absolute value of \(-2\pi\).
6. Add these volumes to get the total volume: \( \frac{22\pi}{3} - 2\sqrt{2}\pi\).

The solution involves careful handling of negative volumes by taking their absolute values and performing integration in polar coordinates for efficiency given the circular base region.
