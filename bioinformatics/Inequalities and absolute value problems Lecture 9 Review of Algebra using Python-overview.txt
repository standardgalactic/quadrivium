To complete your explanation of using inequalities in Python with SymPy, you want to illustrate how to handle an inequality and check its solutions by substituting values within and outside the solution interval.

Here's a continuation and completion of your example:

```python
from sympy import symbols, solve_poly_inequality, Poly

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Solve the polynomial inequality x^2 - 4x > -3
# First, transform the inequality: x^2 - 4x + 3 > 0 (by adding 3 to both sides)
polynomial_expr = x**2 - 4*x + 3

# Create a Poly object for solve_poly_inequality
poly = Poly(polynomial_expr, domain='RR')

# Solve the inequality using solve_poly_inequality
solution_intervals = solve_poly_inequality(poly, '>')
print("Solution intervals:", solution_intervals)

# Verifying solutions with substitution:
# We have two critical points from factoring: (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 -> x = 1 and x = 3

# Check a value within the interval (e.g., x = 2)
test_value_within = poly.eval(2)
print("Substituting x=2:", test_value_within, "Result:", test_value_within > 0)

# Check a value outside the interval (e.g., x = 0 or x = 4)
test_value_outside_1 = poly.eval(0)
print("Substituting x=0:", test_value_outside_1, "Result:", test_value_outside_1 > 0)

test_value_outside_2 = poly.eval(4)
print("Substituting x=4:", test_value_outside_2, "Result:", test_value_outside_2 > 0)
```

### Explanation:

- **Poly Object**: We use SymPy's `Poly` to create a polynomial object. Here, we define the polynomial \(x^2 - 4x + 3\) and specify its domain as real numbers (`'RR'`).

- **Solving Inequality**: The function `solve_poly_inequality` is used to find where the polynomial expression is greater than zero. This returns intervals that satisfy the inequality.

- **Verification with Substitution**:
  - We substitute a value within the solution interval (e.g., \(x = 2\)) and check if it satisfies the original inequality.
  - Similarly, we test values outside the interval (e.g., \(x = 0\) or \(x = 4\)) to ensure they do not satisfy the inequality.

This approach helps verify that the solution intervals are correct by checking specific values within and outside these intervals.

The text describes solving inequalities and absolute value equations using Python with the SymPy library. It explains how to handle quadratic inequalities by breaking them into intervals and checking solutions within those intervals. For instance, an example of a solved inequality yields two intervals: from negative infinity to 1 (not inclusive) and from 3 to infinity. It also illustrates substituting values to verify which ones satisfy the inequality.

For solving absolute value equations, such as \(|x - 3| = 5\), it explains using SymPy functions like `reduce_abs_inequality` or simply `solve`. The text highlights that the solutions are not always represented in a single continuous interval but rather as separate values. For example, \(|x - 3| = 5\) yields two solutions: \(x = -2\) and \(x = 8\).

When dealing with absolute value inequalities like \(|x - 3| < 5\), the solution is an open interval from \(-2\) to \(8\). The text provides examples of substituting values within and outside this interval to verify the inequality.

Overall, SymPy simplifies solving these mathematical problems by providing functions that reduce complex expressions into understandable solutions, while users must be cautious in interpreting results, especially distinguishing between single values and intervals.

In the context you've provided, it seems like you're working with inequalities in Python, particularly using libraries such as SymPy, which are designed for symbolic mathematics.

Here's a breakdown of your process and how to continue solving the given inequality \( x^2 - 4x > -3 \):

### Step-by-step Process

1. **Rewrite the Inequality:**
   Start by rewriting the inequality in standard form:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 3 > 0
   \]
   This is achieved by adding 3 to both sides.

2. **Factor the Quadratic Expression:**
   Factor \( x^2 - 4x + 3 \):
   \[
   (x - 1)(x - 3) > 0
   \]

3. **Find Critical Points:**
   The critical points are where the expression equals zero:
   \[
   x - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

4. **Test Intervals:**
   Use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals and test each interval:
   - \( (-\infty, 1) \)
   - \( (1, 3) \)
   - \( (3, \infty) \)

5. **Determine Sign in Each Interval:**
   Choose a test point from each interval to determine if the product is positive or negative:
   - For \( x < 1 \), choose \( x = 0 \): \((0 - 1)(0 - 3) = (-1)(-3) = 3 > 0\)
   - For \( 1 < x < 3 \), choose \( x = 2 \): \((2 - 1)(2 - 3) = (1)(-1) = -1 < 0\)
   - For \( x > 3 \), choose \( x = 4 \): \((4 - 1)(4 - 3) = (3)(1) = 3 > 0\)

6. **Solution:**
   The solution to the inequality is where the expression is positive:
   \[
   x \in (-\infty, 1) \cup (3, \infty)
   \]

### Using SymPy in Python

Here's how you can solve this using SymPy:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, solveset, S

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Define the polynomial expression
expr = x**2 - 4*x + 3

# Use Poly to define the polynomial with domain as real numbers
poly_expr = Poly(expr, x, domain=S.Reals)

# Solve the inequality using solveset
solution = solveset(poly_expr.as_expr() > 0, x, domain=S.Reals)

print(solution)
```

### Explanation of Code

- **`symbols('x')`:** Defines \( x \) as a symbolic variable.
- **`Poly(expr, x, domain=S.Reals)`:** Creates a polynomial expression with the specified domain (real numbers).
- **`solveset(...)`:** Solves the inequality for \( x \) over the real numbers.

The output should confirm that the solution is \( x \in (-\infty, 1) \cup (3, \infty) \). This approach leverages SymPy's capabilities to handle symbolic mathematics and inequalities effectively.

The text explains how to solve and verify solutions for inequalities using Python, specifically focusing on intervals and absolute value equations. It describes the process of identifying possible solutions expressed as open intervals—for example, all values from negative infinity to one, and from three to infinity—and demonstrates substitution to confirm these results.

For an inequality like \( \frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 3} \leq 0 \), it utilizes a function `reduce_inequalities` with parentheses for clarity in operations. The solution reveals two intervals: \( x \) between \(-1\) and \(1\), or less than \(-3\). Verification involves substituting values within, outside, and on the boundary of these intervals to ensure correctness.

In solving absolute value equations such as \(|x - 3| = 5\), it introduces using functions like `ABS` for absolute values. The solutions are found by converting them into standard equations, yielding results \( x = -2 \) or \( x = 8 \). Verification is performed by substituting these values back into the equation.

For inequalities involving absolute values, such as \(|x - 3| < 5\), a function `reduce_abs_inequality` is used. It simplifies to an interval: \( x > -2\) and \( x < 8 \). Verification involves testing values within and outside this interval to confirm the results.

Overall, Python functions simplify solving inequalities and absolute value problems, allowing for systematic verification of solutions.
