To complete your explanation of using inequalities in Python with SymPy, you want to illustrate how to handle an inequality and check its solutions by substituting values within and outside the solution interval.

Here's a continuation and completion of your example:

```python
from sympy import symbols, solve_poly_inequality, Poly

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Solve the polynomial inequality x^2 - 4x > -3
# First, transform the inequality: x^2 - 4x + 3 > 0 (by adding 3 to both sides)
polynomial_expr = x**2 - 4*x + 3

# Create a Poly object for solve_poly_inequality
poly = Poly(polynomial_expr, domain='RR')

# Solve the inequality using solve_poly_inequality
solution_intervals = solve_poly_inequality(poly, '>')
print("Solution intervals:", solution_intervals)

# Verifying solutions with substitution:
# We have two critical points from factoring: (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 -> x = 1 and x = 3

# Check a value within the interval (e.g., x = 2)
test_value_within = poly.eval(2)
print("Substituting x=2:", test_value_within, "Result:", test_value_within > 0)

# Check a value outside the interval (e.g., x = 0 or x = 4)
test_value_outside_1 = poly.eval(0)
print("Substituting x=0:", test_value_outside_1, "Result:", test_value_outside_1 > 0)

test_value_outside_2 = poly.eval(4)
print("Substituting x=4:", test_value_outside_2, "Result:", test_value_outside_2 > 0)
```

### Explanation:

- **Poly Object**: We use SymPy's `Poly` to create a polynomial object. Here, we define the polynomial \(x^2 - 4x + 3\) and specify its domain as real numbers (`'RR'`).

- **Solving Inequality**: The function `solve_poly_inequality` is used to find where the polynomial expression is greater than zero. This returns intervals that satisfy the inequality.

- **Verification with Substitution**:
  - We substitute a value within the solution interval (e.g., \(x = 2\)) and check if it satisfies the original inequality.
  - Similarly, we test values outside the interval (e.g., \(x = 0\) or \(x = 4\)) to ensure they do not satisfy the inequality.

This approach helps verify that the solution intervals are correct by checking specific values within and outside these intervals.

The text describes solving inequalities and absolute value equations using Python with the SymPy library. It explains how to handle quadratic inequalities by breaking them into intervals and checking solutions within those intervals. For instance, an example of a solved inequality yields two intervals: from negative infinity to 1 (not inclusive) and from 3 to infinity. It also illustrates substituting values to verify which ones satisfy the inequality.

For solving absolute value equations, such as \(|x - 3| = 5\), it explains using SymPy functions like `reduce_abs_inequality` or simply `solve`. The text highlights that the solutions are not always represented in a single continuous interval but rather as separate values. For example, \(|x - 3| = 5\) yields two solutions: \(x = -2\) and \(x = 8\).

When dealing with absolute value inequalities like \(|x - 3| < 5\), the solution is an open interval from \(-2\) to \(8\). The text provides examples of substituting values within and outside this interval to verify the inequality.

Overall, SymPy simplifies solving these mathematical problems by providing functions that reduce complex expressions into understandable solutions, while users must be cautious in interpreting results, especially distinguishing between single values and intervals.
