The text explores various problems related to lenses and their properties, focusing on focal lengths, refractive indices, and the behavior of lenses in different mediums. Here's a summary:

1. **Bi-Convex Lens Problem:**
   - A bi-convex lens has radii of curvature of 18 cm (R1) and 20 cm (R2).
   - Using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_I} = \frac{1}{F} \), where S0 is the object distance (24 cm) and SI is the image distance (32 cm, positive indicating a real image), the focal length F is calculated to be 13.7 cm.
   - To find the refractive index \( N \), the lens maker's formula is used: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{F} = (N - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right)
     \]
   - Solving this gives a refractive index \( N \) of approximately 1.69.

2. **Lens in Water:**
   - A lens with refractive index 1.5 is placed in water (refractive index 1.33).
   - The focal length changes due to the different surrounding medium, calculated using:
     \[
     F_{\text{water}} = F_{\text{air}} \times \frac{N_1}{N_2 - 1}
     \]
   - This results in a new focal length of approximately 39.1 cm.

3. **Bi-Convex Lens in Different Mediums:**
   - A bi-convex lens with radii of curvature both at 20 cm and refractive index 1.5 is analyzed.
   - In air, it has a positive focal distance (converging lens).
   - When submerged in carbon disulfide (refractive index 1.56), the lens behaves as a diverging lens due to the higher refractive index of the medium compared to the lens itself.

The key principle highlighted is that when a lens with a lower refractive index than its surrounding medium is used, it can reverse its typical behavior: bi-convex lenses become diverging and concave lenses become converging. This demonstrates how the optical properties of lenses are influenced by their environment.
