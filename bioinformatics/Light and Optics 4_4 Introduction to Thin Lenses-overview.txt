The text explores various problems related to lenses and their properties, focusing on focal lengths, refractive indices, and the behavior of lenses in different mediums. Here's a summary:

1. **Bi-Convex Lens Problem:**
   - A bi-convex lens has radii of curvature of 18 cm (R1) and 20 cm (R2).
   - Using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_I} = \frac{1}{F} \), where S0 is the object distance (24 cm) and SI is the image distance (32 cm, positive indicating a real image), the focal length F is calculated to be 13.7 cm.
   - To find the refractive index \( N \), the lens maker's formula is used: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{F} = (N - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right)
     \]
   - Solving this gives a refractive index \( N \) of approximately 1.69.

2. **Lens in Water:**
   - A lens with refractive index 1.5 is placed in water (refractive index 1.33).
   - The focal length changes due to the different surrounding medium, calculated using:
     \[
     F_{\text{water}} = F_{\text{air}} \times \frac{N_1}{N_2 - 1}
     \]
   - This results in a new focal length of approximately 39.1 cm.

3. **Bi-Convex Lens in Different Mediums:**
   - A bi-convex lens with radii of curvature both at 20 cm and refractive index 1.5 is analyzed.
   - In air, it has a positive focal distance (converging lens).
   - When submerged in carbon disulfide (refractive index 1.56), the lens behaves as a diverging lens due to the higher refractive index of the medium compared to the lens itself.

The key principle highlighted is that when a lens with a lower refractive index than its surrounding medium is used, it can reverse its typical behavior: bi-convex lenses become diverging and concave lenses become converging. This demonstrates how the optical properties of lenses are influenced by their environment.

The text provides an analysis of problems involving lenses with different radii and refractive indices. Here's a summary:

1. **Bi-Convex Lens Problem**:
   - A bi-convex lens has one side with a radius of 18 cm (positive) and the other with a radius of 20 cm (negative).
   - An object placed at 24 cm produces a real image at 32 cm, allowing calculation of focal length using the lens formula: \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_I} \). The calculated focal distance is 13.7 cm.
   - Using the Lensmaker's equation: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{f} = (N - 1) \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)
     \]
     where \( N \) is the refractive index, results in an index of 1.69.

2. **Lens in Water**:
   - A lens with a refractive index of 1.5 and focal length of 10 cm in air has its properties analyzed when submerged in water (refractive index 1.33).
   - The new focal length is calculated to be 39.1 cm, demonstrating how immersion in a medium changes the behavior of lenses.

3. **Bi-Convex Lens in Different Medium**:
   - A bi-convex lens with both radii at 20 cm and refractive index 1.5 behaves as a converging lens in air, with a positive focal length.
   - When submerged in carbon disulfide (refractive index 1.56), the lens becomes diverging due to the higher medium refractive index compared to the lens itself.

4. **Principle Learned**:
   - If a lens is placed in a medium with a higher refractive index than the lens, its converging properties can reverse: bi-convex lenses become diverging and vice versa.

This analysis underscores the importance of both the physical geometry of lenses (radii) and their interaction with surrounding media in determining optical behavior.
