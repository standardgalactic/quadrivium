The text discusses solving problems involving electrons and positrons moving through magnetic fields, focusing on determining various physical quantities such as speed, magnetic field strength, circulating frequency, period, pitch, and collision time.

1. **Electron Speed**: Given an electron's kinetic energy (1.2 keV), its charge (-1.60 x 10^-19 C), and mass (9.11 x 10^-31 kg), the velocity is calculated using the kinetic energy formula \(v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}}\).

2. **Magnetic Field Calculation**: Using a known radius, the magnetic field strength \(B\) is found with the equation \(r = \frac{mv}{|q|B}\). Rearranging gives \(B = \frac{mv}{|q|r}\).

3. **Circulating Frequency and Period**: The period \(T\) is derived from \(T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}\), where the radius and velocity are known. The frequency is the reciprocal of the period.

4. **Positron in Magnetic Field**:
   - **Period Calculation**: For a positron with kinetic energy (2 keV) moving at an angle to the magnetic field, only the perpendicular component affects circular motion. The period \(T\) is calculated as \(T = \frac{2\pi m}{|q|B}\).
   - **Pitch Calculation**: The pitch \(P\) is determined using parallel velocity and period: \(P = v_{\parallel} \times T\), where \(v_{\parallel} = v \cos(\theta)\).

5. **Collision Time of Electron-Positron Pair**: An unknown particle decays into an electron and a positron in a magnetic field, moving in opposite circular paths. The time until collision is half the period for each particle: \(T/2 = \frac{\pi m}{|q|B}\).

Overall, these problems illustrate the application of fundamental physics equations to determine motion characteristics in magnetic fields.

The text discusses solving problems related to charged particles (electrons and positrons) moving through magnetic fields.

1. **Electron Problem:**
   - An electron with a given kinetic energy is analyzed.
   - The charge and mass of the electron are specified.
   - Using kinetic energy, velocity is calculated using \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}} \).
   - The magnetic field required for circular motion is determined using \( r = \frac{mv}{qB} \), rearranged to find \( B \).
   - Circulating frequency and period are derived from the velocity and radius.

2. **Positron Problem:**
   - A positron with a given kinetic energy moves at an angle in a magnetic field.
   - The period of motion is calculated using perpendicular velocity components.
   - Pitch (distance traveled parallel to the magnetic field) is determined by multiplying parallel velocity with the period.
   - Equations for pitch involve initial kinetic energy and trigonometric functions.

3. **Decay Problem:**
   - A stationary particle decays into an electron and a positron in a magnetic field.
   - The particles move in opposite circular paths due to their charges.
   - Time until collision is half the period of one complete circle, calculated using \( T = \frac{2\pi m}{qB} \).

These problems illustrate the application of physics equations to determine motion characteristics of charged particles in magnetic fields.
