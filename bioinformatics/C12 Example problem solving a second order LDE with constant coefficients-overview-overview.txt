The text describes solving a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The task is to find the solution given initial conditions \( y(0) = -1 \) and \( y'(0) = 2 \).

To solve this, an auxiliary (or characteristic) equation is formed:

\[ 4m^2 + 4m + 17 = 0. \]

Solving this quadratic results in complex conjugate roots: 

\[ m_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + 2i, \quad m_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - 2i. \]

These roots lead to a general solution of the form:

\[ y(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}(c_1 \cos(2x) + c_2 \sin(2x)). \]

Using the initial conditions, we find \( c_1 = -1 \) and \( c_2 = \frac{3}{4} \). Thus, the specific solution is:

\[ y(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}(-\cos(2x) + \frac{3}{4}\sin(2x)). \]

This represents a damped oscillation due to the exponential decay term \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}x} \), which causes the amplitude of the oscillation to diminish as \( x \to \infty \), leading \( y(x) \to 0 \).

The text highlights how such differential equations model real-world damped oscillations, common in physics and engineering.
