The text discusses two main vector-related tasks:

1. **Calculating the Norm of Vector W**:
   - The vector \( \mathbf{W} = (3, 6, -4) \) has a norm calculated as \( \| \mathbf{W} \| = \sqrt{61} \).
   - To find the unit vector in the direction of \( \mathbf{W} \), each component is divided by this norm, resulting in \( \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{61}}, \frac{6}{\sqrt{61}}, \frac{-4}{\sqrt{61}}\right) \).
   - The norm of the unit vector is confirmed to be 1.

2. **Solving for Scalar L**:
   - Given vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), with a scalar \( k = 3 \), the equation \( k\mathbf{u} + L\mathbf{v} = (6, 18, -21) + (-L, -L, 8L) \) is set up.
   - Solving for \( L \):
     - From the first component: \( 6 - L = 2 \), resulting in \( L = 4 \).
     - This value of \( L \) is verified with the other components.

These tasks demonstrate vector normalization and solving scalar equations involving vectors.

The text covers two main vector-related tasks:

1. **Calculating the Norm of Vector W**: 
   - The norm (magnitude) of vector \( \mathbf{W} = (3, 6, -4) \) is calculated using the formula for magnitude: 
     \[
     \| \mathbf{W} \| = \sqrt{3^2 + 6^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{61}
     \]
   - The unit vector in the direction of \( \mathbf{W} \) is found by dividing each component by the norm:
     \[
     \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{61}}, \frac{6}{\sqrt{61}}, \frac{-4}{\sqrt{61}}\right)
     \]
   - The norm of this unit vector is confirmed to be 1, verifying it as a true unit vector.

2. **Solving for Scalar \( L \)**:
   - Given vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), with scalar \( k = 3 \), the equation \( k\mathbf{u} + L\mathbf{v} = (6, 18, -21) + (-L, -L, 8L) \) is set up.
   - Solving for \( L \):
     - From the first component: \( 6 - L = 2 \), leading to \( L = 4 \).
     - Verification with other components confirms that \( L = 4 \).
