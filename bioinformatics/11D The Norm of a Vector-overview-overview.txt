The text discusses two main vector-related tasks:

1. **Calculating the Norm of Vector W**:
   - The vector \( \mathbf{W} = (3, 6, -4) \) has a norm calculated as \( \| \mathbf{W} \| = \sqrt{61} \).
   - To find the unit vector in the direction of \( \mathbf{W} \), each component is divided by this norm, resulting in \( \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{61}}, \frac{6}{\sqrt{61}}, \frac{-4}{\sqrt{61}}\right) \).
   - The norm of the unit vector is confirmed to be 1.

2. **Solving for Scalar L**:
   - Given vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), with a scalar \( k = 3 \), the equation \( k\mathbf{u} + L\mathbf{v} = (6, 18, -21) + (-L, -L, 8L) \) is set up.
   - Solving for \( L \):
     - From the first component: \( 6 - L = 2 \), resulting in \( L = 4 \).
     - This value of \( L \) is verified with the other components.

These tasks demonstrate vector normalization and solving scalar equations involving vectors.
