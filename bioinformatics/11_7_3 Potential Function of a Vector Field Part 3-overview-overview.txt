The text describes a method for determining if a three-dimensional vector field has a potential function and how to find it. The given vector field components are:

1. \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2yz + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + xz^2 \)
2. \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xz + \frac{1}{2}yz^2 + xy \)
3. \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 2xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2z + x^2z \)

To find a potential function, you must verify that the mixed partial derivatives of these components are consistent, implying a Jacobian matrix exists.

Steps to find the potential function \( f(x, y, z) \):

1. **Integrate** \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \) with respect to \( x \):
   - Result: \( f(x, y, z) = 2xyz + \frac{1}{2}xy^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3z^2 + g(y, z) \)

2. **Differentiate** this expression for \( f(x, y, z) \) with respect to \( y \):
   - Result: \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xz + xy + \frac{\partial g(y, z)}{\partial y} \)
   - Solve for \( \frac{\partial g(y, z)}{\partial y} \):
     - Set equal to given component: \( \frac{\partial g(y, z)}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{2}yz^2 \)

3. **Integrate** \( \frac{\partial g(y, z)}{\partial y} \) with respect to \( y \):
   - Result: \( g(y, z) = \frac{1}{4}y^2z^2 + h(z) \)

4. **Differentiate** the updated expression for \( f(x, y, z) \) with respect to \( z \):
   - Result: \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 2xy + x^2z + \frac{1}{2}y^2z + \frac{dh(z)}{dz} \)
   - Solve for \( \frac{dh(z)}{dz} \):
     - Since terms match, \( \frac{dh(z)}{dz} = 0 \), implying \( h(z) \) is a constant.

The potential function is:
\[ f(x, y, z) = 2xyz + \frac{1}{2}xy^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3z^2 + \frac{1}{4}y^2z^2 + C \]
where \( C \) is a constant.

The process involves ensuring that the terms in each component match, and any remaining function of one variable, when differentiated, results in zero, confirming it as a constant. This potential function satisfies the conditions for having a potential for the given vector field.
