The text provides an overview of radiation therapy, focusing on how various types of radiation affect biological tissue differently. This effect is quantified using Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Here's a summary:

1. **Radiation Types and RBE:**
   - X-rays and gamma rays have an RBE of 1.
   - Beta particles (electrons) also have an RBE of 1.
   - Protons possess a higher RBE, around 10.
   - Alpha particles have a significantly higher RBE ranging from 10 to 20.
   - Neutrons exhibit a wide range in RBE, often very high.

2. **Example Calculation:**
   - If a tumor receives a dose of 12 RADs (or grays) from protons with an RBE of 10, this is equivalent to a biological effect of 120 gray-equivalents.
   - To achieve the same biological effect as 1 gray of X-rays, 10 grays of protons are needed.

3. **Biological Effectiveness:**
   - The biological effectiveness is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose (in grays) by the RBE.
   - For example, a proton dose of 12 gray with an RBE of 10 results in a biological effect equivalent to 120 grays.

4. **Radiation Exposure and Health Effects:**
   - Different types of radiation have varying health impacts based on their RBE.
   - High doses (above about 100 rad or 1 gray) can cause acute symptoms like nausea and hair loss.
   - Long-term exposure risks include cancer and genetic damage.

5. **Activity Calculation in Irradiation:**
   - When particles delivering 0.4 MeV each irradiate a tumor, the total energy delivered is calculated to determine activity (number of decays per second) by dividing this energy by the energy per particle.

The text explains how different radiations are used in therapy, their biological impacts, and methods for calculating doses and activities to ensure effective treatment.
