The text discusses the concept of the "centralizer" in group theory. The speaker considers an arbitrary group \( G \) with a set and binary operation, and defines the centralizer of a subset \( A \) within \( G \). The centralizer consists of all elements \( g \in G \) that commute with every element in \( A \); that is, for each \( a \in A \), \( ga = ag \).

The text then proves that this centralizer forms a subgroup of \( G \). Key points include:
- **Associativity** is inherited as the centralizer is a subset of \( G \).
- The **identity element** naturally exists in the centralizer because for any \( a \in A \), it commutes with all elements, including the identity.
- **Closure**: If two elements \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are in the centralizer, their product \( g_1g_2 \) is also in the centralizer. This is shown by demonstrating that \( (g_1g_2)a = a(g_1g_2) \) for all \( a \in A \).
- **Inverses**: If an element \( g \) is in the centralizer, its inverse \( g^{-1} \) is also in the centralizer. This follows from showing that \( g^{-1}a = ag^{-1} \) for all \( a \in A \).

The speaker concludes by noting that the centralizer of even a single element forms a subgroup, and this concept can be extended to any arbitrary subset of the group.

The text discusses the concept of the "centralizer" in group theory. A centralizer is defined for a subset \( A \) within a group \( G \). It consists of all elements in \( G \) that commute with every element in \( A\), meaning for each element \( g \) in the centralizer, and any element \( a \) in \( A\), \( g \cdot a = a \cdot g \).

The text outlines how to prove that this centralizer is indeed a subgroup of \( G\). This involves showing closure under the group operation and the existence of inverses. Closure is demonstrated by verifying that if two elements, say \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \), are in the centralizer, then their product \( g_1 \cdot g_2 \) is also in the centralizer. The proof uses associativity to rearrange terms and show that the commutative property holds for the product.

For inverses, it's shown that if an element \( g \) is in the centralizer, its inverse \( g^{-1} \) is also in the centralizer by using properties of group operations and associativity.

The identity element of the group naturally falls within the centralizer, as it commutes with all elements. Thus, the centralizer satisfies the subgroup criteria: closure, existence of inverses, and containing the identity element, making it a valid subgroup of \( G\).

Furthermore, the text hints at the special nature of centralizers by noting that they can also be defined for individual elements or specific subsets within \( G \), always forming subgroups.
