The text discusses the concept of the "centralizer" in group theory. The speaker considers an arbitrary group \( G \) with a set and binary operation, and defines the centralizer of a subset \( A \) within \( G \). The centralizer consists of all elements \( g \in G \) that commute with every element in \( A \); that is, for each \( a \in A \), \( ga = ag \).

The text then proves that this centralizer forms a subgroup of \( G \). Key points include:
- **Associativity** is inherited as the centralizer is a subset of \( G \).
- The **identity element** naturally exists in the centralizer because for any \( a \in A \), it commutes with all elements, including the identity.
- **Closure**: If two elements \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are in the centralizer, their product \( g_1g_2 \) is also in the centralizer. This is shown by demonstrating that \( (g_1g_2)a = a(g_1g_2) \) for all \( a \in A \).
- **Inverses**: If an element \( g \) is in the centralizer, its inverse \( g^{-1} \) is also in the centralizer. This follows from showing that \( g^{-1}a = ag^{-1} \) for all \( a \in A \).

The speaker concludes by noting that the centralizer of even a single element forms a subgroup, and this concept can be extended to any arbitrary subset of the group.
