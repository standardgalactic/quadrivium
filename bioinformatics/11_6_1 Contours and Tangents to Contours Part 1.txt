Now I want to discuss the concept of a contour, a contour to a multivariable function.
So let's start on this side. I have a function in this r to the power of 2 real 2 real function.
That 2 refers to, on this side of the equation, I have 2 variables and on this side there's this 1.
Now it's not comma something else and I'm making that into a vector, like the vector r of t that we had before.
So we all know if I have f of x and y, there are 2 variables, that's the square.
And on this side I've just got one term, I can double term, so that's the power of 1.
I can equate that to another axis, z.
So if I have this function, my graph will be in 3-space.
My graph will be in 3-space or 3-dimensional space.
In other words, here I have x squared plus y squared, as I said, this is a 3-dimensional ball, parabolic ball.
And if I plot any value, if I go 1, 2 down on the x-axis and the y-axis, I go 1, 2 down on the y-axis.
I'm going to get this point and that's going to correspond to some point there on the z-axis.
Okay, so my z is going to be something, so if I put in 2 plus 2, 2 squared plus 2 squared is going to give me 8.
So that's going to go to 8.
Okay, and that's how we build from this 2-space function as a graph in 3-space.
But it has various, what we call contours in black into 2-space.
It has various contours.
So in the books, we always use x squared plus y squared because that's going to give us nice circular contours.
But a contour needn't be circular, so don't let this example make you believe anything is just a circle.
Depending on our 3-dimensional state, the contours can have various shapes.
But this is important.
So I have this 2-space into 1-space function as a graph in 3-space.
As you can see why I plot an x and a y value, and that gives me a certain z value, and I go up on the z-axis.
But what if I chose a certain z?
I'm going to arbitrarily choose a tangent plane.
So imagine I have this zinc or tins completely level plate, and I put it there at z equals 8.
Imagine this being 3-dimensional, not 2-dimensional on a board.
And I have it, and I put it there parallel to this because remember this axis comes out towards you,
and the z-axis is in this direction, so this bowl stands up.
But I cut it off there.
Zoop!
So it's going to be the same as an xy plane, but at the value z equals 8.
I cut it off, and I see where does my bowl intersect with that plate, and that is called a contour.
That is called a contour, and usually in books, we drop that contour down now into our 2-space.
So if that was 8, it was going to lie here.
That plate was cutting through there, and we bring it down into this plane, and that's going to make a nice circle on that plane.
Why? Let's do that.
We usually say we call it c of contour plot, and funny, c of c.
So now we're going to make a contour at c equals 8, which is nothing other than saying I'm putting z equal to 8.
If I put z equal to 8, I have x squared plus y squared equals 8.
So I'm going to see what values, possible values of x and y, is going to give me a value of 8.
All those values that will give me a z value of 8.
So no matter what I plug in there, I plug in there.
All of them have to equal 8.
So that leaves me with x squared plus y squared equals 8, and I can solve that.
y equals plus or minus the square root of 8 minus x squared.
And this is a single variable function.
This is an r function, which is back to school, back to first year calculus.
It's just an x and y function.
So the contour of this function is in two space, while its actual graph is in three space.
Okay, I think that's quite easy to do.
And now here we've plotted just the positive side.
It's this circle with a radius of two.
And the whole reason why we're doing these contours is just to tell you, explain to you,
what does it mean to have, what does it mean, what does a gradient mean at a certain point?
So let's do the gradient of f of x, y.
Remember that means the point x, y.
Well, that is going to be 2x, 2y.
Okay.
Now what does that mean?
Now this is a vector, I'm going somewhere in the x direction, and some distance in the y direction.
And now I've shown to you, at 8, everywhere where this intersects will be there,
and that is just a semicircle with a radius of 8.
So it's 2 squared root of 2 there, negative 2 squared root of 2 there,
2 squared root of 2 there, negative 2 squared root of 2 there.
And if I plot the point 2 comma 2, that's a radius there of the square root of 8.
Now, what does this vector mean?
What does the gradient vector mean?
It's difficult enough to do it in 3 space, 4 space, 5 space.
Bring it down.
One will always be down.
So if this was, if this is our n, our function, the graph would be in, in r n plus 1,
and the contour will be in, in space.
Okay.
So that function will, the graph of it will be there, and the contour of it will be there.
It's easy to remember.
Okay, but what does it mean?
Say I'm asked for the gradient at a point.
Now, a point that would fit on there is 2 comma 2.
2 comma 2, because if I go 2 down this axis, 2 down that axis, it's going to give me 8.
So that is a point, certainly, that is on my graph,
and we've chosen it such that it is on this specific contour.
The point 2 comma 2 is also in this contour.
So what is this answer?
Well, that's 4 comma 4.
Now, 4 comma 4 is a vector.
In other words, I'm going to move 1, 2 on the x-axis, positive 4.
No, 4, not 2.
4 on the positive x-axis.
That's so skewed.
So I'm moving 1, 2, 3, 4 on the positive x-axis.
1, 2, 3, 4 on the positive y-axis.
And what is the resulting vector?
There is the vector.
And what we are saying, as if by magic, this is what this part of the syllabus is usually all about,
is that the gradient vector, remember this gradient,
which is a line on there or some books below, it's a vector.
The gradient of a multivariable function is a vector.
4 comma 4.
Here's this vector.
This vector is 4, this vector 4 comma 4.
Now, remember, it's actually from an origin if I want to write 4 comma 4.
But whether I draw it there or there or there or there or there or there,
the vector stays the same.
The vector stays the same.
And what we are saying is that the gradient of a multivariable function,
that gradient vector, is perpendicular to, listen carefully,
it is perpendicular to the tangent of the contour at that point.
So, listen again, if I take my graph, the graph refers to what you actually draw in whatever space,
you add 1 to that, in plus 1, 2 becomes 3, 3 space.
Okay?
The gradient, if I take that three-dimensional curve and I choose a contour,
in other words, I make this z, the specific value,
if I choose a contour, that contour is now in two-space.
And I choose a point on that contour.
Remember, that point on the contour is also a point on my graph itself.
The gradient, the gradient of my multivariable function at that point is a vector.
And that vector is perpendicular to the tangent line at that point of the contour.
Okay?
That is what it means.
The tangent line is not perpendicular,
or the gradient vector is not perpendicular.
Don't, don't, don't draw a line in your, in your mind perpendicular.
Don't see this bowl.
Have a tangent plane to it.
And the gradient is not something that's perpendicular there.
It's perpendicular to the contour.
The gradient vector is perpendicular to the,
perpendicular to the tangent of the contour at that point.
Now, that is what a gradient means.
Now, we've just learned that the gradient
of a function at a point is a vector.
Remember, the gradient is just a vector field.
Is a vector perpendicular to the tangent of a contour of a graph.
Now, what do we do with that information?
Well, remember, now, we've just had the situation
where we had, at this point,
we have a tangent line,
and we have this gradient
of f
at p,
at point p.
Now,
to do multivariable calculus,
it is good to have had a
elementary course
in linear algebra,
because we do need to know about dot products,
which we've used extensively already,
and we do need to know
that the dot product between,
and we've done that as well,
between two perpendicular vectors is zero.
So, I can get the equation
of this tangent line.
Now, remember
what we said.
If we have the f of x and y,
okay,
that is in two space.
So,
the contour
at some specific point
will be in two space.
The contour,
I should say that,
will be in two space.
And the curve itself,
the graph,
the graph will be in three space,
three dimensional.
Okay.
So, if I have it,
if I have f of x of y,
this is the type of function that I have,
the contour will be in two space,
just x and y.
The graph itself
is in three dimensional space.
If I have the f of x, y, and z,
if I have the f of x, y, and z,
now remember,
this is
a contour,
a contour will be in three space,
but the graph
will be in four space,
will be in four space.
So,
if I have a function,
let's have
f of x, y, and z
equals x squared plus y squared plus d squared.
You cannot imagine in your mind
that four dimensional curve.
Okay,
but its contour will be in three space.
So,
whereas the contour of this was a line,
the contour of this
is going to be a three dimensional curve.
Okay,
we're always,
we're always dropping down.
So,
whereas this graph is in three space,
the contour is in two dimensional space.
So,
remember,
I said,
it's not always a nice circle.
It can be any graph,
but it's a line.
It's a line.
But from here,
we're going to,
and if it's a line,
we have a tangent line.
So,
from here,
in four space,
four dimensional space,
our curve,
our contour is going to be in three dimensions.
And we'll have a tangent,
not a tangent line,
but a tangent plane.
We'll have a tangent plane.
Now,
for us to get the equation of this tangent line,
or in this case,
the tangent plane,
all we need to know is that we already have one vector.
We know that it's perpendicular,
that it's perpendicular to this either line or plane.
And if I go higher than that,
it's going to be a hyperplane,
even the contour.
And I know that the dot product between two vectors must be zero.
So,
all I need is a vector,
another vector along this.
And that's easy to get,
because all I need is a point,
and I'm given a point P in the problem,
and I just make up another point,
X.
So,
I'll make up a vector,
X minus P.
That'll be my new vector.
I think the camera's batteries are going to go,
I'm going to change batteries,
and we'll go on with this example.
There we go.
So,
this is our equation,
the curve will be in four space,
the contour is now in three space,
and the contour will have a tangent plane.
Let's get that.
Now,
first of all,
do not make a mistake.
We're not looking for the equation of a tangent hyperplane to this curve.
We're looking for the equation of a tangent plane to the contour.
These are two different things.
This tangent line to this contour line is not the same as the tangent plane
to any point in my three-dimensional curve here.
Do not confuse the two tangents.
The contour curve and the graph are two separate things.
Okay.
So,
let's make it at point P equals 1,1,1.
So,
what do we need?
Well,
we need two things.
First of all,
we're going to get the gradient of F.
First,
let's get the gradient.
So,
I'm going to get the first,
second,
and third partial derivatives.
That's 2x,
2y,
2z.
And now I get the gradient at a specific point.
My point 1,1,1,
which is going to be easy.
2,2,2.
I've just put in,
substituted 1,
1,
and 1 in there.
So,
that's that.
Now,
I have,
now,
it's not the same as this.
Remember,
this now comes from a two-space contour curve.
Now,
I have a three-space contour curve.
A three-space contour curve.
But the same applies.
I've got a perpendicular vector.
Now,
I just need a vector along this plane that I'm looking for.
Very easy to construct because you have two points.
And if you have two points in,
in one-dimensional space,
two-dimensional space,
three-dimensional space,
four-dimensional space,
if you have two points,
you have a vector.
Okay,
because I can select any point on that.
In this instance,
curve.
In this instance,
line,
that will just be x and y,
here it's this,
and I subtract,
subtract from that,
the other point that I have,
my point is 1,
1,
1,
1.
Both of those lie in the required tangent plane that I'm looking for.
Both of them lie,
x, y, and z can be anything,
and that's what I want.
Okay,
so what is my vector x minus 1 comma y minus 1 comma z minus 1?
That vector lies,
let's forget,
let's forget this.
If I just had that,
x and y,
I choose anyway,
but it will be on the line here.
And I have another one.
If I just subtract one from the other one,
I have a vector along that line.
Same here,
I now have a vector along that plane.
Now,
all I need to do is get the dot product between that and that,
set it equal to zero,
because those two vectors are perpendicular to each other,
and lo and behold,
I'll have an equation for the tangent plane
to the contour of that multivariable equation
at a certain point.
So let's get the dot product,
two times that,
that is going to be 2x minus 2,
plus 2y minus 2,
plus 2z minus 2 equals zero,
and I'm left with x plus y plus z equals 3.
x plus y plus z equals 3 is going to be the equation
of the tangent plane to a point on the contour.
Okay, once again,
make this,
have this very clear in your mind.
There's a difference between the contour plot,
the contour and the graph itself.
I've explained it numerous times now.
There's a difference between those two.
And we remember how to get the equation to the tangent.
Remember that?
That was our local linearization.
That was going to be the fp minus,
what is this,
x minus p
times the dot product with the gradient of f at p.
Remember that?
That was for a tangent to the graph itself,
or in that instance to the graph itself.
This,
this is an equation for,
have I written it anyway?
This is an equation for the tangent.
Okay, let me just write that,
let me just write that tangent,
tangent to the curve.
We write that c because remember it will always be
at a certain,
at a certain value.
It's going to equal the dot product between
x, y, and z,
x,
x, and y,
whatever,
minus p.
The dot product.
So any,
any kind of vector,
a vector that I construct with a point
and an arbitrary point,
okay,
the dot product of that
and the gradient of f
at that point.
So if I get that dot product,
I have the tangent to the curve,
but remember this was the tangent to the graph
at that point,
two different things.
