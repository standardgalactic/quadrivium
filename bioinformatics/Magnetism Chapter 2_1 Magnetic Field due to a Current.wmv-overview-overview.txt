The text explains how to calculate magnetic fields generated by currents in wires using the Biot-Savart Law. This law shows that a current-carrying wire or moving charged particle creates a magnetic field, which depends on factors like the permeability constant (\(\mu_0\)), current (I), differential length element (ds), and angle (\(\phi\)). The magnetic field strength decreases with the square of the distance from the wire.

The text highlights using vector mathematics and the right-hand rule to determine the magnetic field's direction. It applies this to a semicircular wire, noting that integration is simplified due to a constant radius along the arc, allowing straightforward calculation of the field's magnitude at point C.

Finally, it introduces the right-hand thumb rule for determining the magnetic field direction: curl your fingers in the current's direction with your thumb along the wire; your fingers show the field's direction around the wire. For a semicircle centered on point C, this means the magnetic field points outwards from the plane of the board.
