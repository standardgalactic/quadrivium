The text outlines the method to calculate the volume of a cylinder using polar coordinates, starting with the familiar formula for the cylinder's volume in Cartesian coordinates. It explains converting from Cartesian (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ), where x and y are represented as \( r \cos(\theta) \) and \( r \sin(\theta) \), respectively.

To ensure accuracy in this transformation, the Jacobian matrix is utilized. The text details constructing a vector function with variables r and θ, then determining its Jacobian's determinant, which simplifies to r. This confirms that the differential element in polar coordinates (\( r \, dr \, d\theta \)) corresponds to the small rectangular elements used in Cartesian coordinates.

For volume calculation, integration is performed over a quarter circle, with results multiplied by four due to symmetry. By integrating θ from 0 to \( \pi/2 \) and r from 0 to R, the text verifies that the resulting expression for the cylinder's volume remains consistent: \( \pi r^2 h \), where r is the radius of the base, and h is the height. This demonstrates how polar coordinates offer a systematic approach for volume calculations through coordinate transformation techniques.
