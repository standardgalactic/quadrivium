The text discusses key concepts in multivariable calculus, focusing on differentiation and its applications. It starts by explaining the gradient of a function with respect to two variables (e.g., \(x\) and \(y\)), which represents the rate of change along specific axes (\(dx\) and \(dy\)). The main goal is to derive an equation for the tangent plane at a given point on a surface, analogous to finding the tangent line in single-variable calculus.

Additionally, the text introduces the concept of local linearization, where complex multivariable surfaces are approximated by simpler planes. This approximation makes calculations more manageable and helps in understanding small segments of these higher-dimensional curves or surfaces.

The discussion then shifts to challenges encountered when differentiating functions at specific points. In single-variable calculus, issues like discontinuities (e.g., jump discontinuities) or cusps can prevent differentiation due to non-existent limits. These complexities increase in multivariable contexts, making the study of gradients and partial derivatives both challenging and interesting.

In summary, the text highlights two main objectives in multivariable calculus: finding tangent planes for better geometric understanding and using local linearization for easier computation when dealing with complex surfaces.

The text discusses limits and derivatives in both single-variable and multivariable calculus. In single-variable calculus, if the left-hand and right-hand limits do not exist at a point, it indicates issues with continuity or differentiability there. If you can take the derivative of a function at that point, it implies the function is continuous.

In contrast, in multivariable calculus (in two or three dimensions), having partial derivatives along each axis does not guarantee a smooth curve or the existence of a tangent plane. Unlike single-variable functions, where limits are considered from just two directions, in multivariable functions, one can approach a point from infinitely many directions in space.

This complexity means that even if partial derivatives exist at a point, it does not ensure differentiability or the presence of a well-defined tangent plane. The text uses an analogy of approaching a point on a three-dimensional surface (like a blanket) from multiple paths to illustrate this idea. Thus, additional conditions are needed in multivariable calculus beyond just having partial derivatives to ensure smoothness and differentiability at a point.

The text discusses the concept of limits in multivariable calculus, specifically when approaching a point from infinitely many directions. The main idea is to ensure that the limit of a function \( f(x, y) \) as it approaches a specific point \((a, b)\) is consistent regardless of the path or curve taken.

The speaker explains that one must consider all possible paths (or curves) converging on a point and confirm that they yield the same limit value. This consistency is crucial for determining if the function behaves smoothly at that point, which in turn allows for the definition of a tangent plane at that location.

To address this challenge, the text introduces using vectors to express limits: instead of considering \( x \) approaching a single point, it suggests thinking about both \( x \) and \( y \) together as a vector approaching another vector. This method helps in analyzing how the function behaves near the given point from all possible directions.

Ultimately, this approach sets up for discussing gradients or partial derivatives, which help in formally evaluating these limits and understanding the smoothness of functions at specific points in multivariable contexts.

The text discusses how to analyze the existence of limits for a function \( f(x, y) = \frac{x}{y} \) at the point \((0, 0)\). The method involves examining different curves or paths that approach this point and checking if they yield the same limit value.

1. **Partial Derivatives Context**: Initially, there's mention of partial derivatives along \(x\) and \(y\) axes to determine changes in \(z\), but the focus shifts to evaluating limits through specific paths.
   
2. **Curve Construction**: By constructing different curves (or lines) passing through \((0, 0)\), one can assess whether a limit exists at that point. If two different paths provide different limit values, the overall limit does not exist.

3. **Example Path - \( y = 2x \)**: The text specifically suggests examining the line \(y = 2x\) to see how \(f(x, y)\) behaves as \((x, y)\) approaches \((0, 0)\). This approach helps determine if there's a consistent limit value along different paths.

4. **Domain Exclusion**: It is noted that the function excludes \(y = 0\), which affects the analysis since division by zero is undefined.

5. **Conclusion on Limits**: If evaluating different paths results in inconsistent limits, it indicates that no single limit exists at \((0, 0)\). This is analogous to a step function where discontinuity implies non-existence of the limit at certain points.

Overall, the text emphasizes using path analysis to determine the existence and value of limits for multivariable functions.

The text describes an exploration of a mathematical limit involving a specific curve, referred to as "curve c." This curve passes through the origin (0, 0) and is defined by the equation \( z = \frac{x}{y} \). The speaker is interested in examining the behavior of a function \( f(x, y) \) as \( (x, y) \) approaches the point (0, 0), specifically along this curve.

To facilitate the analysis, the curve is redefined with a parameterization where \( y = g(x) = 2x \). This allows the limit to be expressed in terms of \( x \) alone: 

\[
\lim_{x \to 0} f(x, g(x)) = \lim_{x \to 0} f(x, 2x)
\]

This approach simplifies the examination by focusing on how the function behaves as it approaches the origin along this specific path. The text implies that choosing a particular path (in this case, curve c) can significantly affect the outcome of the limit calculation.

The text describes a process involving the limit as \( x \) approaches zero for a function composed of \( f(x, g(x)) \). Here, \( g(x) = 2x \), and when simplified, the result is found to be \( \frac{1}{2} \). This calculation pertains to examining behavior on a three-dimensional curve defined by \( z = \frac{x}{y} \).

Instead of moving along the x-axis, the approach involves constructing a new axis through a specific point on this curve. When considering \( g_1(x) = 2x \), one arrives at a limit result of \( \frac{1}{2} \). However, if another path is considered with \( g_2(x) = 3x \), the behavior changes because substituting \( x = 0 \) yields different results for \( y \).

The key point here is that the limit depends on the path taken. Using \( g_1(x) = 2x \) gives a limit of \( \frac{1}{2} \), while using \( g_2(x) = 3x \) leads to a different outcome, indicating that the limit is not consistent across all paths and thus does not exist in a general sense. This illustrates the concept of path dependency in limits within multivariable calculus.

The text discusses evaluating a limit for a function as \(x\) and \(y\) approach 0. It illustrates this by considering different paths (curves) to the point where \(y = 3x\). Along one path, the limit evaluates to \(\frac{1}{2}\), while along another path (\(y = 3x\)), it evaluates to 3. Since these limits are not equal, it indicates that the overall limit does not exist at this point. The text explains that if any single path yields a different limit than others, you can conclude the overall limit does not exist. While examining multiple paths (such as 4, 5, or more) might sometimes yield consistent results, inconsistency in just one case is sufficient to determine non-existence of the limit at that point. This method partially solves the problem of determining limits by showing a specific scenario where different paths lead to different results.

The text discusses the complexity involved in determining the existence of limits for different curves approaching a particular point. While many curves might converge to the same limit, this does not guarantee that the specific curve chosen will behave similarly. This is important because if even one path results in a non-existent limit, it implies that a tangent plane cannot be defined at that point.

The technique mentioned helps quickly identify when limits do not exist by choosing different paths (curves). Over time, familiarity with these paths aids in recognizing which ones yield consistent limits and which do not. If the limit does not exist along any path, it indicates the impossibility of defining a tangent plane there.

Thus, simply calculating partial derivatives for \(x\) and \(y\) is insufficient to find an equation for the tangent plane at that point. One must first ensure the existence of the limit from all directions as one approaches the specific spot.

The text discusses a scenario where something becomes increasingly challenging to manage or understand, emphasizing that this difficulty can escalate significantly. The use of repetition highlights the growing complexity or problem. If there are specific details you would like further summarized or clarified, please let me know!
