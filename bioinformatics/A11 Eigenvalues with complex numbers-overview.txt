The text describes solving a system of linear differential equations using complex eigenvalues. The given system is:

- \( x' = 6x - y \)
- \( y' = 5x + 4y \)

This system can be written in matrix form as:

\[ \mathbf{x}' = A\mathbf{x} \]

where 

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & -1 \\ 5 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}. \]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation:

\[ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0. \]

The determinant calculation is:

\[ \det\left(\begin{bmatrix} 6-\lambda & -1 \\ 5 & 4-\lambda \end{bmatrix}\right) = (6-\lambda)(4-\lambda) + 5 = \lambda^2 - 10\lambda + 29. \]

Setting this equal to zero gives the quadratic equation:

\[ \lambda^2 - 10\lambda + 29 = 0. \]

Using the quadratic formula, 

\[ \lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]

we find:

\[ \lambda = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 116}}{2} = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{2} = 5 \pm 2i. \]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 + 2i \) and \( \lambda_2 = 5 - 2i \).

For each eigenvalue, we find the corresponding eigenvector by solving:

\[ (A - \lambda I)\mathbf{k} = 0. \]

For \( \lambda_1 = 5 + 2i \):

\[ A - \lambda_1 I = \begin{bmatrix} 1-2i & -1 \\ 5 & -1-2i \end{bmatrix}. \]

Solving the system:

\[ (1-2i)k_1 - k_2 = 0, \]
\[ 5k_1 + (-1-2i)k_2 = 0. \]

From the first equation, \( k_2 = (1-2i)k_1 \). Choosing \( k_1 = 1 \), we get:

\[ \mathbf{k}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1-2i \end{bmatrix}. \]

For \( \lambda_2 = 5 - 2i \), the eigenvector is the complex conjugate of \( \mathbf{k}_1 \):

\[ \mathbf{k}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1+2i \end{bmatrix}. \]

This demonstrates that when dealing with real matrices and complex eigenvalues, the eigenvectors will also be complex conjugates.

The text discusses solving a problem involving two complex-valued functions, which are not constant multiples of each other. Two specific values are given: \( x_1 = 1 - 2i \) and \( x_2 = 1 + 2i \). The general solution for the system is expressed as a linear combination of exponential functions:

\[ c_1 e^{(5 + 2i)t} \]
\[ c_2 e^{(5 - 2i)t} \]

Here, \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. The solution is presented as the final set for this system of equations, with a note that further expansion will occur in an upcoming example.

The text describes solving a system of linear differential equations with complex eigenvalues. The system is given by:

\[ x' = 6x - y \]
\[ y' = 5x + 4y \]

This can be expressed in matrix form as:

\[ \mathbf{x}' = A\mathbf{x} \]

where \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & -1 \\ 5 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \) and \(\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}\).

To solve this, the eigenvalues of matrix \( A \) are found by solving:

\[ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \]

This leads to the characteristic equation:

\[ (6-\lambda)(4-\lambda) + 5 = \lambda^2 - 10\lambda + 29 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula, the eigenvalues are calculated as:

\[ \lambda = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 116}}{2} = 5 \pm 2i \]

These complex conjugate eigenvalues indicate oscillatory behavior in the system's solutions.

For \( \lambda_1 = 5 + 2i \), the corresponding eigenvector is found by solving:

\[ (A - \lambda_1 I)\mathbf{k}_1 = 0 \]

This results in:

\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ -1 & -2i \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} k_{11} \\ k_{12} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \]

Solving this gives the eigenvector:

\[ \mathbf{k}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 - 2i \end{bmatrix} \]

For \( \lambda_2 = 5 - 2i \), the corresponding eigenvector is the complex conjugate of \(\mathbf{k}_1\):

\[ \mathbf{k}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 + 2i \end{bmatrix} \]

The solutions to the differential equations will involve these eigenvalues and eigenvectors, reflecting oscillatory behavior due to the imaginary components. The real part of the eigenvalues (5) indicates exponential growth or decay, while the imaginary parts (\(\pm 2i\)) indicate oscillations.

The text describes two distinct values used as part of a solution set for a mathematical problem. These values are not constant multiples of each other, which means they represent different components of the solution. Specifically:

- \( x_1 \) is defined using the value \( 1 + (1 - 2i) \), and it forms the expression \( e^{(5 + 2it)} + c_2 \).
- \( x_2 \) utilizes the value \( 1 + (1 + 2i) \), forming the expression \( e^{(5 - 2it)} \).

Here, \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. The final solution set is composed of these expressions involving exponential functions with complex exponents. This set represents a general solution to an unspecified problem, which will be expanded upon in the following example.
