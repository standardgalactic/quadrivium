The text describes solving a system of linear differential equations using complex eigenvalues. The given system is:

- \( x' = 6x - y \)
- \( y' = 5x + 4y \)

This system can be written in matrix form as:

\[ \mathbf{x}' = A\mathbf{x} \]

where 

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & -1 \\ 5 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}. \]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation:

\[ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0. \]

The determinant calculation is:

\[ \det\left(\begin{bmatrix} 6-\lambda & -1 \\ 5 & 4-\lambda \end{bmatrix}\right) = (6-\lambda)(4-\lambda) + 5 = \lambda^2 - 10\lambda + 29. \]

Setting this equal to zero gives the quadratic equation:

\[ \lambda^2 - 10\lambda + 29 = 0. \]

Using the quadratic formula, 

\[ \lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]

we find:

\[ \lambda = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 116}}{2} = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{2} = 5 \pm 2i. \]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 + 2i \) and \( \lambda_2 = 5 - 2i \).

For each eigenvalue, we find the corresponding eigenvector by solving:

\[ (A - \lambda I)\mathbf{k} = 0. \]

For \( \lambda_1 = 5 + 2i \):

\[ A - \lambda_1 I = \begin{bmatrix} 1-2i & -1 \\ 5 & -1-2i \end{bmatrix}. \]

Solving the system:

\[ (1-2i)k_1 - k_2 = 0, \]
\[ 5k_1 + (-1-2i)k_2 = 0. \]

From the first equation, \( k_2 = (1-2i)k_1 \). Choosing \( k_1 = 1 \), we get:

\[ \mathbf{k}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1-2i \end{bmatrix}. \]

For \( \lambda_2 = 5 - 2i \), the eigenvector is the complex conjugate of \( \mathbf{k}_1 \):

\[ \mathbf{k}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1+2i \end{bmatrix}. \]

This demonstrates that when dealing with real matrices and complex eigenvalues, the eigenvectors will also be complex conjugates.

The text discusses solving a problem involving two complex-valued functions, which are not constant multiples of each other. Two specific values are given: \( x_1 = 1 - 2i \) and \( x_2 = 1 + 2i \). The general solution for the system is expressed as a linear combination of exponential functions:

\[ c_1 e^{(5 + 2i)t} \]
\[ c_2 e^{(5 - 2i)t} \]

Here, \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. The solution is presented as the final set for this system of equations, with a note that further expansion will occur in an upcoming example.
