Linear Algebra
Let's just have a quick look at this shortcut
We'll remember the plane normal form of the equation of a plane
inasmuch as it was AX0 plus BY0
plus CZ0 plus D equals
0 or I could have had the D on the other side
So if I had the normal vector, it was perpendicular, I had a point
Remember I needed another point in the plane, PXYZ
So that I could form my vector PZP
which is in the plane, and that would have been
X-0, Y-0, Z-0
So this would have been X, Y, and Z
And for me to get the point normal form
out of an equation, remember we said the normal vector
top product with a vector
in the plane should be 0
So for me this would have been
1X
plus 2Y
plus 3Z
would
equal 0
And remember
we said it was very easy to read off
this AB, AB, and C
refer to the 1, 2, and 3
in the normal
in the normal vector
the vector perpendicular to the plane
so we could always read that off
Now we were given a second point
remember the second point perpendicular to the very same vector
was going to have the same AB and C
was going to have the same AB and C
was going to have the same AB and C
coefficients, constants, in front of them
the only thing that would have changed
would have been this 0
Now let's do it the long way
the point P
so my point P0P
would now have been
x minus 2
x minus 2
and y minus 4
and z minus 3
that would have been P0P
now I needed to multiply
to the dot product of N
with P0P
So what would I have gotten?
I would have gotten 1 times x minus 2
plus
I would have gotten twice
y minus 4
and I would have gotten
and 3 times z minus 3
that would have been 0
so I would have had x plus 2y
plus 3z
as we predicted because my AB and C
for both of them
my AB and C
is the normal vector 1, 2, and 3
would have been the same
but now I would have had something else
and if I took that something else
to the other side
that something else would have been 19
well the easiest way to get that
is just to take
your normal vector and your point
because that's where all the constants
that's where all the constants come from
so 1 times 2 is 2
plus 8
plus 9 is 19
all you have to remember
is it mustn't be on this side
it will be negative 19 on this side
if you take it to the other side
that's 19
so you can write
x, y, z
for this shortcut
you can put in your AB and C
from your normal vector
1, 2, and 3
and on the
right hand side
equal
you can just multiply these
and add them
2
plus 8
plus 9
equals
19
because
this point will satisfy
satisfies the equation of the plane
so if I had equals
negative D on the other side
but now remember
it just has to satisfy
it just has to satisfy the plane
the equation for the plane
I know what AP and C is
because I have 1, 2, and 3
now I plug in zeros
for
the values for
e zero
which is x zero, y zero, z zero
and that has got to equal
that has got to satisfy
that equation
in other words
it has simple
it has to be 19
so it's not actually a shortcut
because
it makes absolute intuitive sense
and it's what we're doing
the long way around
but just very quickly
to see what your constant D would be
on the right hand side
just multiply these values
and add them to each other
not really a shortcut
but
this understands me clearly
a plane has
infinitely many equations
why does a plane have
infinitely many
the exact same plane
has infinitely many equations
because
my normal can have any length
that I choose
remember
for the dot
point normal form
it's
n dot P zero P
has got to equal zero
the dot product
between those two
have got to be zero
but if I have
my equation
ax zero
plus
by zero
plus
cz zero
equals D
if I write it in that form
this is my vector
n
it's my vector
a
b
and c
a b and c
but I can multiply this by 2
that would be multiplied by 2
that means
this will be 2
that will be 2
that will be 2
I have changed nothing in that equation
whatsoever
but I have a brand new equation
because imagine my normal was
1, 2, 3
and I multiplied by 2
that means
2 times
my vector is now going to be
2, 4, 6
and if that was then
1 times x
plus 2 times y
plus 3 times z
equals
say for instance
it was 4
and I multiplied by 2
that means 2x
plus 4y
plus
6z
exactly what I have there
equals 8
there is two equations
there are two equations here
for exactly describing
exactly the same plane
furthermore
if I do have a plane in an xyz coordinate
in an xyz coordinate system
if I do have a plane there
if I do have a plane there
and I want the norm of that plane
how do I get the norm of that plane?
remember if I have two vectors lying in the plane
I have two vectors lying in the plane
now of course
there will be one vector
there will be another vector
from the origin
ok
they will also be parallel to the plane
if I take both of them
say for instance
the plane does not go through 0
but if they are in the same direction
with the same magnitude
they remain exactly the same vectors
if I get the cross product of these two vectors
say that it was vector v1
cross product vector v2
is going to give me a resultant vector
which is perpendicular to them
since both of them lie in the plane
the new vector will be perpendicular to my plane
and that will suddenly become
one of the infinitely many normal vectors
to my plane
now let's look at this vector and this plane
my vector v is 1, 2, and negative 1
as far as x, y, and z are concerned
and I have a plane
x plus y plus 3z equals 5
so I have written it in this format
that the 5 is on the other side
is that vector perpendicular
parallel
parallel
is it connected to this plane
parallel to this plane
or neither
well
I can get the normal to this plane very easily
the normal to my plane here
is going to be
1, 1, 3
1, 1, 3
and now think clearly
what does a normal mean
if I have a plane
I have my x, y, z coordinate system
and I have a plane
what is a normal to the plane
well I said
a plane has infinitely many normales
there
as long as that's parallel
perpendicular to the plane
there
there
everywhere
it has
massive
there's one there as well
that's also normal to that plane
okay
but remember our definition of a vector
what is a vector
I can redraw a vector
based from the origin up
from the origin up
so what I'm actually saying
that all of those lines
is this vector
is this vector
so don't think our vectors are sitting here
okay
that might be
you know
from that point
but all the vectors are
are there
and as much as
if the vector has the same direction
so this will obviously be the negative of that
but if it has the same direction
or
and magnitude
those vectors stay the same
so all vectors can be represented by this
and even though this point
zero zero zero
is not on the plane
is not on the plane
that vector is still perpendicular to that plane
and all I can change now
is this is magnitude
by multiplying some
some scalar by my normal
and that will give me a new normal
which is still perpendicular to that plane
which is still perpendicular to that plane
okay
so all normals
don't see them as being from a certain point
from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system out
and it can be in any space
2 space, 3 space, 4 space
n space
okay it's perpendicular and it comes out
so
let's first look at this
n
and v
this is not some multiple of this
1 times
1 times
1 times
1 should be 1 times
3 should be 3
so there's no proportionality between these two
there's not a scalar multiple of this
that gives me that
so certainly
they are
they are not
inasmuch as
as far as this plane is concerned
this vector is parallel
is perpendicular to that plane
and this is not
and this is not
parallel to this
inasmuch as
this is longer
or shorter
it's a scalar multiple
and this is not
so this is certainly
not perpendicular to this
can it be parallel to it?
can it be parallel?
well if it was parallel to this plane
if I had my plane here
and this vector here
was a vector there
which is now parallel to the plane
now as I said
that plane here
can go through the origin
up
up
or down
from the origin
but
but
this vector
will still be parallel
parallel to that
and I have my normal
and if I have my normal
my normal
is
perpendicular to my plane
is perpendicular to my plane
okay
so if I get the dot product
between these two now
and that equals zero
that means these two
are perpendicular to each other
now let's do that
let's do v
dot product n
what does that mean?
1 times 1 is 1
2 times 1 is 2
negative 1 times 1 is negative 3
and lo and behold
that equals zero
that means these two
are perpendicular to each other
and since this one
is perpendicular to the plane
that means this one
must be parallel to the plane
so this vector is pinned
out to this plane
not perpendicular
Thank you.
