The text outlines solving a differential equation using separation of variables for the equation \(\frac{1}{y^2 - 4} \, dy = dx\). Here's a concise summary:

1. **Separation and Integration**: Variables are separated, leading to integration on both sides.
   
2. **Denominator Handling**: Recognizes \( y^2 - 4 = (y-2)(y+2) \), excluding \( y = \pm 2 \).

3. **Partial Fractions**: Decomposes \(\frac{1}{(y-2)(y+2)}\) into partial fractions, finding coefficients \( a = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( b = -\frac{1}{4} \).

4. **Integration**: Integrates both sides:
   \[
   \int \left( \frac{1}{4(y-2)} - \frac{1}{4(y+2)} \right) dy = \int dx
   \]
   Resulting in:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \ln |y-2| - \frac{1}{4} \ln |y+2| = x + c_1
   \]

5. **Logarithmic Simplification**: Uses logarithm properties to simplify:
   \[
   \ln \left| \frac{y-2}{y+2} \right| = 4x + c_2
   \]
   Exponentiating gives:
   \[
   \frac{y-2}{y+2} = c_3 e^{4x}
   \]

6. **Solving for \( y \)**: Rearranges to solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 2 \frac{1 + ce^{4x}}{1 - ce^{4x}}
   \]
   where \( c = e^{c_2} \).

7. **Lost Solutions**: Recognizes that solutions \( y = \pm 2 \) are lost in the process. \( y = 2 \) is recovered by setting \( c = 0 \), but \( y = -2 \) must be included as a singular solution.

The general solution is:
\[ 
y = 2 \frac{1 + ce^{4x}}{1 - ce^{4x}}
\]
with \( y = -2 \) as an additional singular solution.
