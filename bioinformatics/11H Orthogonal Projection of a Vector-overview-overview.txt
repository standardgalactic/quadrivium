The text explains how to project one vector onto another using orthogonal projections, focusing on projecting vector \(\mathbf{u}\) onto vector \(\mathbf{a}\). By placing \(\mathbf{a}\) along the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system, vector \(\mathbf{u}\) is decomposed into two components: one parallel (\(\mathbf{w}_1\)) and one orthogonal (\(\mathbf{w}_2\)) to \(\mathbf{a}\). The magnitude of the projection component (\(\mathbf{w}_1\)) is derived using the dot product:

\[ \|\mathbf{w}_1\| = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|} \]

Since \(\mathbf{w}_1\) is a scalar multiple of \(\mathbf{a}\), it can be expressed as:

\[ \mathbf{w}_1 = k\mathbf{a}, \quad \text{where } k = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \]

Thus, the projection of \(\mathbf{u}\) onto \(\mathbf{a}\) is:

\[ \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \mathbf{a} \]

The orthogonal component (\(\mathbf{w}_2\)) is:

\[ \mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{u} - \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} \]

Adding these components gives back the original vector \(\mathbf{u}\):

\[ \mathbf{u} = \text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{w}_2 \]

The text also discusses expressing the norm of this projection using trigonometric relationships. The dot product \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}\) is represented as \( |\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{a}| \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{a}\). Substituting this into the scalar projection formula gives:

\[ \frac{|\mathbf{u}| \cos(\theta)}{|\mathbf{a}|} \]

This represents the length of the orthogonal projection of \(\mathbf{u}\) onto \(\mathbf{a}\), forming a right triangle where the projected vector's magnitude is one side. This geometric interpretation aids in understanding vector decomposition, breaking down vectors into components parallel and orthogonal to another vector, which simplifies vector analysis by aligning vectors along specific directions.
