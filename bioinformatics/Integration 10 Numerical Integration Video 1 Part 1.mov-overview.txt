The text discusses methods for estimating the area under a curve when the antiderivative of a function cannot be expressed with elementary formulas. Such functions include \( \sin(x^2) \) and \( 1/\ln(x) \), as well as scenarios where data is derived from experiments without an explicit equation.

To estimate these areas, numerical integration techniques are used. The text outlines three methods:

1. **Riemann Sums**: This method divides the area under a curve into rectangles of equal width (\(\Delta x\)). For left Riemann sums, the height of each rectangle is determined by evaluating the function at the left endpoint of each subinterval. Conversely, right Riemann sums use the function value at the right endpoint for the height.

2. **Trapezoidal Sums**: This approach improves on Riemann sums by averaging the areas from both left and right Riemann sums. Instead of rectangles, trapezoids are used to approximate the area under the curve, where each segment is treated as a trapezoid with parallel sides formed by function values at consecutive endpoints.

3. **Simpson's Sums**: Though not detailed in this text, Simpson's rule is another numerical integration technique that provides even more accurate approximations by fitting parabolas to segments of the curve instead of straight lines or rectangles.

As the number of subdivisions (rectangles or trapezoids) increases, these methods yield increasingly accurate estimates of the area under the curve. The text mentions that as \(\Delta x\) approaches zero, these sums converge to the exact integral value.

The text discusses methods for estimating the area under a curve when an antiderivative cannot be expressed using elementary functions. It introduces numerical integration techniques like Riemann sums, trapezoidal sums, and Simpson's sums.

1. **Riemann Sums**: This method divides the interval \([a, b]\) into \(n\) rectangles of equal width (\(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\)). For left Riemann sums, the height of each rectangle is determined by the function value at the left endpoint of each subinterval. Conversely, right Riemann sums use the function value at the right endpoint.

2. **Trapezoidal Sums**: This technique approximates the area under the curve using trapezoids rather than rectangles. It involves taking the average of the areas calculated by left and right Riemann sums, effectively connecting consecutive points with straight lines to form trapezoids.

3. **Simpson's Sums**: Although not detailed in this text, Simpson's rule is another method for numerical integration that provides a more accurate approximation by using parabolic segments instead of linear ones.

As the number of subdivisions increases (i.e., \(\Delta x\) approaches zero), these methods yield increasingly accurate estimates of the area under the curve. The next discussion promises to delve into trapezoidal sums specifically.
