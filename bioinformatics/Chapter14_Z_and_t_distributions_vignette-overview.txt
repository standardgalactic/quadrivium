In the previous lecture, you learned how the area under a curve relates to probability or p-values. When comparing means across two or more groups, computers generate graphs where we can analyze these areas: one is a z-distribution, and the other is a t-distribution.

The z-distribution requires knowledge of the population standard deviation, which is often unknown in practice. As a result, the t-distribution is commonly used instead when this information isn't available.
