The text discusses how to determine the phase angles of two waves with different amplitudes when combined. Here's a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**:
   - Two waves have identical frequency and wave velocity but different amplitudes: 5 mm and 7 mm.
   - The first wave has a phase angle of zero radians, while the second has an unknown phase angle (\(\phi\)).
   - The resultant wave amplitude is given as 9 mm.

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - The waves are added vectorially to find \(\phi\).
   - Using trigonometric identities and the Pythagorean theorem, equations for the resultant amplitude in both x and y directions are set up.
   - Solving these gives \(\cos(\phi) = 0.1\), leading to \(\phi \approx 1.5\) radians.

3. **Extended Problem**:
   - Another scenario is considered with amplitudes of 5 mm and 8 mm, where the phase angle of the first wave is zero.
   - The goal is to find the phase angle for the second wave that results in minimum resultant amplitude.
   - Maximum amplitude (13 mm) occurs when waves are in phase (\(\phi = 0\)), while minimum amplitude (3 mm) occurs when they are out of phase (\(\phi = \pi\)).

4. **Special Case**:
   - If the second wave's phase angle is 90 degrees, the resultant amplitude can be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem, yielding approximately 9.43 mm.

The text emphasizes understanding vector addition and trigonometry to solve for unknown phase angles in wave interference problems.

The text discusses wave interference and how phase differences between waves affect their resultant amplitude. Here's a summary:

1. **Interference Basics**: When combining waves, maximum resultant amplitude occurs when the angle (phase difference) between them is 0 radians, while minimum resultant occurs at π radians.

2. **Four-Wave Interference**: The text introduces four wave equations with identical amplitude, angular frequency, and phase differences. If all phases are equal, the resultant can be simplified using cosine functions.

3. **Phase Relationships**:
   - When certain waves have a phase difference of π (180 degrees), they cancel each other out, leading to zero resultant displacement.
   - For example, waves 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 with a phase difference of π result in no net displacement due to their cosine values being zero.

4. **Adding Three Waves**: When three waves are considered:
   - If two have a phase difference of π, they cancel each other out.
   - The resultant depends on the remaining wave's phase angle.
   - For instance, if one phase is 0.7π, the resultant can be calculated using cosine functions.

5. **Complex Phase Differences**: When phases are not simple multiples of π (e.g., 2π), calculating the resultant requires careful consideration of each wave's contribution and may involve more complex calculations using phase angles.

Overall, the text emphasizes understanding how phase differences influence wave interference patterns and the resulting amplitude.
