The text discusses a model for population growth using differential equations, transitioning from exponential to logistic growth. Initially, it describes exponential growth where the rate of change in population (\( \frac{dy}{dt} \)) is proportional to the current population size \( y(t) \). This model assumes unlimited resources and space.

However, this idealistic scenario changes with limited resources and competition among organisms. The text introduces a logistic growth model to account for these limitations. In this model, the rate of change in population still includes the proportionality constant but is also affected by the difference between the current population size and a theoretical maximum capacity \( m \). This results in the equation:

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = ky(m - y) \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality, and \( m \) is the carrying capacity or maximum sustainable population.

This logistic equation incorporates two equilibrium solutions:
1. When \( y = 0 \), there is no growth (\( \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \)).
2. When \( y = m \), the population has reached its maximum, and again, there is no further growth (\( \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \)).

To solve this differential equation, it's recognized as separable, allowing separation of variables:

\[ \int \frac{1}{y(m - y)} \, dy = \int k \, dt \]

Using partial fraction decomposition, the left-hand side is split into two simpler integrals that can be solved separately. The text outlines steps to decompose \( \frac{1}{y(m-y)} \) into fractions involving constants \( a \) and \( b \):

\[ \frac{1}{y(m - y)} = \frac{a}{y} + \frac{b}{m - y} \]

Through substitution and solving, the values for \( a \) and \( b \) are determined, facilitating integration:

- When \( y = 0 \), find \( a \).
- When \( y = m \), find \( b \).

This results in integrals of the form \( \int \frac{1}{y} \, dy \) and \( \int \frac{1}{m - y} \, dy \), leading to solutions involving natural logarithms. These are then used to express the population over time, illustrating how it asymptotically approaches the carrying capacity \( m \).

The logistic model thus provides a more realistic depiction of population dynamics under resource constraints compared to the idealized exponential growth model.

The text describes the process of solving a first-order separable differential equation known as the logistic equation. Here's a summary:

1. **Integration**: The equation involves integrating expressions like \( \frac{1}{y} dy \) and \( \frac{1}{m - y} dy \), resulting in natural logarithms: \( \ln |y| \) and \( \ln |m - y| \).

2. **Constants and Simplification**: Constants are factored out, and the equation is simplified to:
   \[
   \ln |y| - \ln |m - y| = kmt + c
   \]
   where \( m \) is a constant.

3. **Exponentiation**: Both sides of the equation are exponentiated to remove logarithms, leading to:
   \[
   \frac{y}{m-y} = ae^{kmt}
   \]
   where \( a = e^c \).

4. **Solving for \( y \)**: Rearranging gives:
   \[
   y = ame^{kmt} - ay e^{kmt}
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   y(1 + ae^{kmt}) = ame^{kmt}
   \]

5. **Final Solution**: Solving for \( y \) results in the general solution:
   \[
   y = \frac{ame^{kmt}}{1 + ae^{kmt}}
   \]

This solution describes the behavior of a population modeled by the logistic equation, with equilibrium solutions and parameters that influence growth dynamics.
