The text discusses a model for population growth using differential equations, transitioning from exponential to logistic growth. Initially, it describes exponential growth where the rate of change in population (\( \frac{dy}{dt} \)) is proportional to the current population size \( y(t) \). This model assumes unlimited resources and space.

However, this idealistic scenario changes with limited resources and competition among organisms. The text introduces a logistic growth model to account for these limitations. In this model, the rate of change in population still includes the proportionality constant but is also affected by the difference between the current population size and a theoretical maximum capacity \( m \). This results in the equation:

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = ky(m - y) \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality, and \( m \) is the carrying capacity or maximum sustainable population.

This logistic equation incorporates two equilibrium solutions:
1. When \( y = 0 \), there is no growth (\( \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \)).
2. When \( y = m \), the population has reached its maximum, and again, there is no further growth (\( \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \)).

To solve this differential equation, it's recognized as separable, allowing separation of variables:

\[ \int \frac{1}{y(m - y)} \, dy = \int k \, dt \]

Using partial fraction decomposition, the left-hand side is split into two simpler integrals that can be solved separately. The text outlines steps to decompose \( \frac{1}{y(m-y)} \) into fractions involving constants \( a \) and \( b \):

\[ \frac{1}{y(m - y)} = \frac{a}{y} + \frac{b}{m - y} \]

Through substitution and solving, the values for \( a \) and \( b \) are determined, facilitating integration:

- When \( y = 0 \), find \( a \).
- When \( y = m \), find \( b \).

This results in integrals of the form \( \int \frac{1}{y} \, dy \) and \( \int \frac{1}{m - y} \, dy \), leading to solutions involving natural logarithms. These are then used to express the population over time, illustrating how it asymptotically approaches the carrying capacity \( m \).

The logistic model thus provides a more realistic depiction of population dynamics under resource constraints compared to the idealized exponential growth model.

The text describes the process of solving a first-order separable differential equation known as the logistic equation. Here's a summary:

1. **Integration**: The equation involves integrating expressions like \( \frac{1}{y} dy \) and \( \frac{1}{m - y} dy \), resulting in natural logarithms: \( \ln |y| \) and \( \ln |m - y| \).

2. **Constants and Simplification**: Constants are factored out, and the equation is simplified to:
   \[
   \ln |y| - \ln |m - y| = kmt + c
   \]
   where \( m \) is a constant.

3. **Exponentiation**: Both sides of the equation are exponentiated to remove logarithms, leading to:
   \[
   \frac{y}{m-y} = ae^{kmt}
   \]
   where \( a = e^c \).

4. **Solving for \( y \)**: Rearranging gives:
   \[
   y = ame^{kmt} - ay e^{kmt}
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   y(1 + ae^{kmt}) = ame^{kmt}
   \]

5. **Final Solution**: Solving for \( y \) results in the general solution:
   \[
   y = \frac{ame^{kmt}}{1 + ae^{kmt}}
   \]

This solution describes the behavior of a population modeled by the logistic equation, with equilibrium solutions and parameters that influence growth dynamics.

The text explains a transition from an exponential growth model to a logistic growth model for predicting population dynamics. Initially, it describes how exponential growth is characterized by a rate of change proportional to the current population size. However, this approach doesn't account for competition and resource limitations in real-world scenarios.

To address these factors, the logistic equation introduces a second factor, \(m - y\), where \(m\) represents the theoretical maximum population (carrying capacity) that the environment can sustain. This modifies the growth rate to be proportional not only to the current population size but also to how much room there is for additional growth before reaching the carrying capacity.

The logistic equation is a first-order separable differential equation expressed as:

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = ky(m - y)
\]

where \(k\) is a constant of proportionality. The text explains that this model predicts two equilibrium states: when the population size, \(y\), is zero (no organisms) and when \(y\) equals \(m\) (the carrying capacity). At these points, there can be no further change in population size.

To solve the logistic equation using separation of variables, the differential equation is rearranged to:

\[
\frac{1}{y(m - y)} \, dy = k \, dt
\]

Partial fraction decomposition is used to simplify the left side, resulting in:

\[
\frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{m-y}
\]

After integration, these lead to a solution involving natural logarithms. The constants are determined by initial conditions and the logistic growth curve can then be plotted to show how the population grows rapidly initially but slows as it approaches the carrying capacity \(m\). This model more accurately reflects real-world biological populations where resources limit unchecked exponential growth.

The text describes solving a first-order separable differential equation known as the logistic equation. The process involves integrating and manipulating expressions to isolate variables, ultimately finding a general solution for \( y \).

Here's a summary of the steps:

1. **Integration**: Start with an expression involving \( m - y \) and integrate both sides. Recognize that since \( m \) is a constant, it can be factored out.

2. **Natural Logarithms**: The integration results in expressions involving natural logarithms: \(\ln |y|\) and \(-\ln |m-y|\).

3. **Simplification**: Combine the logarithmic terms to simplify the expression: \(\ln y - \ln (m-y)\), which equals \( kt + c \).

4. **Exponentiation**: Exponentiate both sides to eliminate the logarithms, resulting in an equation involving exponentials.

5. **Rearrangement**: Simplify further by recognizing that \( e^{\ln y} = y \) and \( e^{-\ln (m-y)} = \frac{1}{m-y} \).

6. **Isolate \( y \)**: Rearrange the equation to solve for \( y \), leading to an expression involving constants and exponentials.

7. **Final Solution**: The final solution is expressed as a function of time, showing how \( y \) evolves over time according to the logistic model.

The general solution reflects the behavior of the system with two equilibrium points, characteristic of logistic growth models.
