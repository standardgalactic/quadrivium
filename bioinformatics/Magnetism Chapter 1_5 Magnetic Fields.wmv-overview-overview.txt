The text explores the dynamics of a charged particle moving within a magnetic field and derives key relationships that describe its motion:

1. **Force and Acceleration**: A charged particle experiences acceleration due to a force from the magnetic field, resulting in centripetal acceleration expressed as \(a = \frac{v^2}{r}\), where \(v\) is velocity and \(r\) is the circular path's radius.

2. **Magnetic Force Equation**: The force acting on the particle can be described by \(F = qvB\), with \(q\) representing charge, \(v\) velocity, and \(B\) magnetic field strength. This leads to the equation \(\frac{mv^2}{r} = qvB\).

3. **Radius of Circular Path**: Solving for \(r\), it is found that the radius is \( r = \frac{mv}{qB} \). The radius depends directly on mass and velocity, while inversely on charge and magnetic field strength.

4. **Direction of Motion**: The motion direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) depends on the particle's charge and the magnetic field orientation. For example, electrons move clockwise if the field is directed into the board.

5. **Period of Circular Motion**: The period \(T\), which is the time for one complete circular path, is given by \( T = \frac{2\pi m}{qB} \). This period is independent of both radius and velocity.

6. **Frequency and Angular Velocity**: Frequency (\(f\)) can be calculated as \( f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{qB}{2\pi m} \), indicating the number of circular paths completed per second. The angular velocity (\(\omega\)) is \( \omega = 2\pi f = \frac{qB}{m} \).

These equations are crucial for understanding charged particle behavior in magnetic fields, applicable to scenarios where speeds are significantly lower than the speed of light.
