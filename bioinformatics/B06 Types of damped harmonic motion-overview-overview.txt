The text provides a summary of solving homogeneous, second-order linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients by analyzing the roots of their characteristic equation, which determines three cases: overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped systems.

1. **Overdamped (Real Roots):** Occurs when \(\lambda^2 > \omega^2\), resulting in real and distinct roots \(m = -\lambda \pm \sqrt{\lambda^2 - \omega^2}\). The solution is:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 e^{(-\lambda + \sqrt{\lambda^2 - \omega^2})t} + c_2 e^{(-\lambda - \sqrt{\lambda^2 - \omega^2})t}
   \]

2. **Critically Damped (Real and Equal Roots):** Occurs when \(\lambda^2 = \omega^2\), leading to a double root \(m = -\lambda\). The solution is:
   \[
   x(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t)e^{-\lambda t}
   \]

3. **Underdamped (Complex Conjugate Roots):** Occurs when \(\omega^2 > \lambda^2\), resulting in complex roots \(m = -\lambda \pm i\sqrt{\omega^2 - \lambda^2}\). The solution is:
   \[
   x(t) = e^{-\lambda t}(c_1 \cos(\sqrt{\omega^2 - \lambda^2}t) + c_2 \sin(\sqrt{\omega^2 - \lambda^2}t))
   \]

The text concludes by recommending the use of graphing software like Desmos to visualize these solutions and discusses how these mathematical models apply to oscillatory systems. It highlights an enhancement in modeling physical accuracy by adding a term that accounts for damping proportional to velocity, reflecting real-world motion dynamics more accurately. This approach is rooted in thought experiments illustrating damping effects on oscillations.
