The text outlines seven fundamental limit laws that simplify calculating limits when they exist. These include:

1. **Addition/Subtraction Law**: Limits can be added or subtracted as their respective components.
2. **Constant Multiplication Law**: A constant factor can be extracted from a limit operation.
3. **Product Rule**: The limit of a product is the product of individual limits.
4. **Quotient Rule**: The limit of a quotient is the quotient of individual limits, provided the denominator’s limit isn’t zero.
5. **Power Rule**: The limit of a function raised to a power is that power applied to the function's limit.
6. **Constant Limit Law**: The limit of a constant is the constant itself.
7. **Identity Law**: The limit of \( t \) as it approaches \( c \) is \( c \).

These laws are illustrated with examples, particularly involving polynomials and constants, to show how they simplify calculations when limits exist. For example:

- Limits of polynomial sums or differences can be calculated by finding each component’s limit and then performing the addition or subtraction.
- A constant multiplied outside a function allows separation from the limit operation.
- Products of functions can have their limits taken individually before multiplying them together.
- Dividing polynomials involves calculating individual limits, ensuring the denominator's limit isn't zero.

The text emphasizes these laws apply only when limits exist and uses arithmetic examples to demonstrate their utility. It provides a walkthrough for evaluating limits using polynomial expressions:

1. **Individual Limits**: For fractions with polynomial numerators and denominators, take limits separately, ensuring the denominator is non-zero at the point of interest.
2. **Example Calculation**:
   - Evaluating \(\lim_{t \to 2} (t-1)^2\) involves substituting \( t = 2 \), resulting in \( (2-1)^2 = 1 \).
3. **Limit Laws**: Limits can be directly taken for constants and variables, e.g., \(\lim_{t \to 2} 3 = 3\) or \(\lim_{t \to 2} t = 2\).

The text encourages using these basic limit laws when applicable and hints at future discussions on more complex scenarios where limits may not exist.
