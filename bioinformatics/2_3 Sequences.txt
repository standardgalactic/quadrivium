Now that we have our four tools, we're going to mess things up completely.
And we're going to look at sequences that have factorials in them.
And just to remind ourselves what a factorial is, if I have n factorial,
that means it is, that equals 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 times whatever, times n.
In other words, if n equals 1, it will just be 1 factorial equals 1.
2 factorial equals 1 times 2, and that equals 2.
So 3 factorials can equal 1 times 2 times 3, and that equals 6.
And the only one that's oddballed out is that we do define 0 factorial also to be 1.
And just make sure that you remember that 0 factorial equals 1.
So if we have any sequence with a factorial in it, we can see if it converges or diverges directly or indirectly.
We're going to look at the indirect method first.
And to decide whether it is convergent or not, and we don't, if it is convergent,
this method's not going to tell us exactly what that L value is.
But for it to be convergent, by the indirect method, convergent,
it has to have two things.
Number one, it's got to be monotonic.
And by monotonic, we mean it's either decreasing, so if we make those little dots,
they are always decreasing for every value, for every successive value of n,
they're always decreasing, or they're always increasing.
And the sequence also has to be bound.
So we're going to look at how to calculate whether the sequence decreases or increases.
And if it does, if it doesn't jump up and down, then it's monotonic.
And we're going to look at when is it bound.
And if both of these conditions are met, then we can say that the sequence that contains factorials converges.
Now, let's first look at whether a sequence increases or decreases, whether it's monotonic or not.
And there is a method that we are going to use, but first, a little curiosity.
This sequence, n factorial, divided by n over n from n equals 1 to infinity, divided by n to the power n.
Now, I think you would agree with me that this is 1 times 2,
let me put it in, times 3, times 4, times 5, times 6,
divided by, say, times, times n.
Divide it by n times n times n times n times n times n times whatever times n.
And there'll be equal number of factors.
There'll be n number of factors in the denominator, and there'll be n factors in the numerator.
Now, please don't confuse this with some sort of series.
This is the nth term, the nth element of my set, or the nth term in my sequence.
Okay?
So, it'll be something, comma, something, comma, something, comma, something.
It's a sequence, and this is the nth element in my sequence.
Okay, I think what you can look, if you do look at it,
let's just look at the first one, if n equals just 1.
So, my first element is going to be 1 over 1, so that's 1.
My second element is going to be 1 times 2 is 2, 2 times 2 is 4.
That's a half.
My next one is going to be 6, and it's going to be 3 times 3 times 3 is 27.
So, really, I'm at 6 over 27.
I think what you can see from this is I'm never going to reach a situation where this value is going to be less than 0.
There's no way in which this is going to, if the numerator is always smaller than the denominator,
we never have negative values in the numerator or denominator, that's probably the best way to see this.
There's never going to be a negative in either, so this is always going to be larger.
This is always going to be larger than 0.
So, you see, I'm going to sort of use the squeeze theorem here.
Now, let's rewrite this.
I'm just going to take out 1 over n, and now I'm going to be left with 2 times 3 times 4 times whatever to n.
And here, I'm going to have n times n times n times whatever times what they'll be.
I won't go fully to n because I've still got 1 n here.
If we just look at this as this gets sufficiently large, look what happens.
So, I'm going to have...
What I'm going to show you is, or what you might just see for yourself,
is this is always going to be, or we can denote this as just as 1.
And why can we do that?
Let's have a look.
Let's n equals 2.
Just for this, but just 2.
So, we can do 2 over 2, and that's 1.
Then we get 2 times 3.
6 and 3 and 3 is 9.
6 over 9, 1 over 3.
So, for 4,
4 times 4, 16, 16 times 4,
what is that, 16 times 4.
16 times 4, 32, 64.
Divided by 4 is 12, over 24.
What this shows, once again, is that
it's never going to be more than 1.
It's successfully going to get smaller and smaller.
So,
we can see this as just being 1.
It's never going to increase this
more than this 1 over n.
This is never going to be more than 1.
So, once again,
if I take the limit as n goes to infinity of 0,
that is 0.
And if I take the limit of n equal,
n tends to infinity of 1 over n,
that is also going to be 0.
Hence,
this,
this is going to equal 0.
The difficult part is just
not understanding what is happening here
and why I'm making this 1.
It can never be more than 1.
In other words,
this is the maximum
this is going to be.
This is the maximum
this is going to be.
So, this
is 0
is less than
my sequence
is less than 1 over n.
Because,
as I go along here,
all my elements become
successively smaller.
The largest one that it can ever be
is 1.
And if I multiply 1,
it stays there.
But if I,
if it becomes less than 1,
this is going to become even smaller.
So,
this is the maximum
that I'm going to get on,
on this right-hand side.
And now,
I'm taking the limit of this,
the limit of that,
and it equals 0.
And that means,
I mean,
the,
the,
it converges.
This is a convergent sequence
and it converges to 0.
And I did it by the squeeze theorem.
But just understanding
what is happening,
why this,
with this 1 over n
will be the maximum.
So,
an angle will always be more than that.
As n gets bigger,
this is going to become even smaller.
So,
it's going to be,
I don't want to say bound now
because we're going to look at bound states.
it's going to be bound there
as its,
as its maximum.
Okay?
So,
it converges to 0.
Good.
Now,
with our first example
using factorial
out of the weights
to see if it's convergent
or divergent,
divergent,
I need now to show you a way
to see whether a sequence
is increasing or decreasing.
So,
I need to show you
that each subsequent,
each subsequent element
in my set,
element in my sequence
is more than
or less than
the one before.
Now,
let's look at this example
where my sequence
is n divided by n plus 1
from n equals 1
to n equals infinity.
So,
let's look at
if I just have
the a of n.
That is going to be
n divided by n plus 1.
And,
if I look at
the very next one,
n plus 1,
that is going to be
n plus 1
over n plus 2.
Because it's
the previous,
I'm just going to add
another one.
It says n plus 1 plus 1.
Okay.
So,
what do I do
to show that this
is always more than that
irrespective of what n is
or this is always less than that
irrespective of what n is?
I can just take
the fraction of that.
Can I not?
a of n plus 1
divided by a n.
I can look at what,
if,
I can look at what that is.
Now,
let's do that.
So,
that's n plus 1
divided by n plus 2
divided by that
or multiply it
by n plus 1
over n.
So,
what is that equal to?
Well,
that is n squared
plus 2n
plus 1
and this is
n squared
plus 2n.
If I just multiply,
this is multiply.
Okay.
Now,
I need to put,
I can put brackets
around there.
This is the associative law
of addition.
So,
I'm just associating
those two.
So,
what I'm left with here
is this over this,
which is this 1
plus 1
over n squared
plus 2n.
Okay.
So,
this is always,
this is always going to be
a fraction,
a positive fraction
because irrespective
of what these two are,
this is always going to be positive.
That's positive,
this is positive,
the fraction is positive
because positive
divided by positive
is positive.
So,
I'm always going to add
something to 1.
So,
it's always going to be
more than 1.
So,
it's always going to be positive.
So,
that divided by that
is always going to be
more than 1
or it's always,
one point is always going
to be positive.
In other words,
this is increasing.
It will always increase
because no matter
what my value of n here is,
each next n,
each next n
divided by the previous one
is always going to be
more than 1.
Okay.
So,
I shouldn't have said
it's positive.
The most important thing
is it's more than 1.
That's what's important here.
Okay.
If it was less than 1,
that means this is a fraction,
that means this is less than that.
Okay.
And that would be decreasing.
So,
forget what I said there.
It's got to be more than 1.
Not the fact that it's positive.
It's got to be more than 1.
This shows that my numerator
is more than my denominator.
So,
n plus 1
is always going to be
more than n.
So,
this term in my sequence
is always going to be
larger than this term
element in my sequence.
So,
that means
this sequence is increasing.
Let's look at a problem
that's slightly more difficult.
We have this sequence
n factorial
divided by e to the power n.
First of all,
let's just do,
we're just going to see
if it's monotonic.
And monotonic means
it's always increasing
or always decreasing.
So,
let's look at what
a to the n is.
It's going to be
n factorial
divided by e to the power n.
And n plus 1
is going to be
n plus 1 factorial
divided by e to the power
n plus 1.
There's not much
that I can do with it
in this state.
I need to rewrite it.
And this is something
you'll have to check
for yourself.
n plus 1 factorial
equals n factorial
times n plus 1.
So, check that out
check that out for yourself.
That's true.
And I can rewrite this
with my rules
for powers.
So, that's going to be
e times e to the power n.
e times e to the power n.
Okay.
So, that's going to be
a to the power n.
So, that's going to be
a to the power n.
Okay.
Now, let's look at
a n plus 1
divided by a n.
That is going to be
n factorial
n plus 1
divided by e
times e to the power n
divided by this
or multiplied
e to the power n
divided by n factorial.
Now, I'm going to get rid
of my n factorial.
I'm going to get rid
of my e to the power n.
And I'm left with
a of n plus 1
divided by a of n
equals
n plus 1
divided by e.
Now, remember what
the value of e is.
It's less than 3.
It's less than 3.
So, what I didn't do
in the previous example
or what you can do
to make it clearer
is let's just multiply
both sides by that.
So, a n plus 1
equals
n plus 1
divided by e
times
a n.
Now, which one
is bigger?
Now, look at this.
If n equals 1
1 plus 1 is 2
which is smaller than
which is smaller than e
so
a small
a fraction
less than 1
times a to the n
means it's going to be
smaller
it's going to be
smaller than this
but now, look at what
happens when n equals 2
2 plus 1 is 3
so
it's going to be
3 over e
which is more than 1
which is more than 1
means that this
this will be
larger
than
this will be
larger
than this side
and if I make this
4
4 plus 1
is 5
5 divided by e
it's more than 1
so I'm going to
increase this
okay
now, just look at it
carefully
so let's make it
4
4 plus 1 is 5
5 divided by e
is more than 1
okay
so it's more than 1
divided by this
so in other words
this has got to be
smaller than this
so this is always going to
this is always going to
increase
no matter what the
specific situation is
it's always going to
it's always going to
increase
if I just had a look at this again
for any n
more equal to 2
this is going to be
more than 1
and meaning
that this
numerator is larger
than the denominator
don't get me confused
about what I
what I just said
when I used 2 as an example
that was wrong
okay
but for n equals 1
the reverse is 2
so it's only for n
that is 1
these are integers
so I'm only dealing with
1, 2, 3
so it's only for n equals 1
that this doesn't happen
but for all the rest
for all the rest
so 1 was going to be this
it was going to decrease
but for all the rest
it's increased
and remember
I'm only interested in
what happens at infinity
if it converges
or diverges
so I wasn't really interested
in doing this little bit
so I can call
we can call this
we can call this sequence
an increasing sequence
okay
just be very careful
when you write it like this
or like this
that you don't make
the silly little mistake
that I did
okay
so if this is more than 1
that means this has got to be
smaller than that
for these two sides
little inside
and little inside
to be equal
so maybe it's better
to look at this
if this is more than 1
this means
the numerator
is going to be larger than
it's got to be larger
than the denominator
so we've looked
now at examples
all our examples
up until now
has been
I don't think
we're going to do
we might do an exercise
as one
that is decreasing
so these are all increasing
now I need to look
at whether they are bound
because we are going to say
this is remember
still the indirect method
if a sequence
is monotonic
so it's always increasing
or always decreasing
and remember
this means
it's always increasing
you can throw away
that a little bit
and it is bound
then it does converge
okay
so next
we are going to look
and where the sequence
is bound
oh
we are going to
we are going to look
really
I want to labor
so
there
I want to look
