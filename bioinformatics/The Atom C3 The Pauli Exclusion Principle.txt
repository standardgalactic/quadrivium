So let's do a few problems. We need the ground state
electron configuration for cadmium
with an atomic number 48.
So we need 48 electrons. Now you've got to have memorized
a table, but let's do it from scratch.
And what I'm going to do is write 1
2
3, 4, 5
6, and
we can carry on. Let's do that.
7, 8, 9, 10.
Let's have a look. How do I get to 1?
But I've got to get some rules. I've got to add 2 numbers and I've got to
equal 1. What I want to add is the n number plus the
l number. And because that is the principal quantum number
and the orbital quantum number, I know the
orbital quantum number has got to be 1
less than. That's my
first rule. So my first
number has always got to be larger than
my second number. They can't be equal and
l can't be more than n.
My second rule is if I have
a few options
to get to that
my n numbers have got to be
in
ascending order.
In other words, 2, 3,
4, 5.
You'll see what I mean.
So obviously, how can I get to 1
with these two rules? The only one I can do is 1 plus 0.
I can't do anything but that.
For 2, obviously I can also just get 2 plus 0.
I can't have 1 plus 1 because
my l value, my orbital quantum number is going to be
at least 1 less than my principal quantum number.
How do I get to 3?
I have 2 possibilities. I have 2 plus 1 and I have 3 plus 0.
Both of that will give me 3.
But remember, I said I want ascending order
from going down
or shall we call that
ascending, descending.
But anyway, 2, 3, 4
and it's got to get bigger as we go down.
So for 4, what possibilities do I have?
I can't have 2 plus 2, obviously.
I've got to have 3 plus 1.
3 plus 1 and then there's a 4 plus 0.
There's a 4 plus 0, both of them.
Now what about 5?
I can have 3 plus 2.
That would be allowed.
4 plus 1 will be allowed
and 5 plus 0 will be allowed.
All of those give me 5.
What about 6?
I can't have 3 plus 3.
obviously.
I can have 4 plus 2.
I can have 4 plus 2.
I can have 5 plus 1
and I can have 6 plus 0.
What about 7?
Well, I can have 4 plus 3.
I can have 5 plus 2
and I can have 6 plus 1
and I can have 7 plus 0.
I can have 7 plus 0.
What about 8?
Well, I can have 5 plus 3, 6 plus 2, 7 plus 1, 8 plus 0.
Here I can have 5 plus 4, 6 plus 3, 7 plus 2, 8 plus 1, 9 plus 0.
And what about 10? I can have 6 plus 4, 7 plus 5, 8 plus 4.
Oh, where am I now? 8 plus 3.
Where am I? Where am I going?
5, 6, it's going to be getting larger.
So then 7 plus 3, 8 plus 2, 9 plus 1, 10 plus, I'm sure you won't see down there, 10 plus 0.
So there I've just constructed my table.
I need just to decide based on the L value because I know the maximum will be 2 times 2L plus 1.
So if I just want to put values in here for maximum electrons, for 0 I'm going to get 2.
Let's put a 2 in there, I'm going to put a 2 in there.
We remember for 1 that will be a 6.
For 0 that will be a 2.
For 1 that will be a 6.
For 0 that will be a 2.
For 2, 2 times 2 is 4 plus 1 is 5, times 2 is 10.
For L equals 1.
For L equals 1.
For L equals 1 we'll have 6 again.
We'll have 2 again.
So I can write down the maximum electrons for each subshell.
For 2 I'm going to have a 10.
For 1 I'm going to have a 6.
For 0 I'm going to have a 2.
Let's carry on.
For 3, 3 times 2 is 6.
6 plus 1 is 7 plus 2 is 14.
I'll be able to put 14.
I'll be able to put 14 electrons in there.
Where are we?
For 2, for 2, for 2, for 2 we're going to have 10.
For 1 we're going to have 6.
And for 0 we're going to have 2.
For 3, 3 times 2 is 6.
Plus 1 is 7.
Times 2 is 14 as we had before.
2 times 2 is 12.
For 2 we're going to have 10.
For 1 we're going to have 6.
For 0 we're going to have 2.
For 4.
4 times 2 is 8 plus 1 is 9.
9 times 2 is 18.
For 3 again we're going to have 14.
For 2 we're going to have 6.
For uh, uh, for 2 we're going to have 10.
10.
For 1 we're going to have the 6.
For 0 we have 2.
For 4, 4 times 2 is 8 plus 9,
there's 8.
1 is 9, 9 times 2 is 18, as we had before, etc, etc. So I've constructed my whole table.
Now I need to get to 48. So I have 2 plus 2 is 4, plus 6 is 10, plus 2 is 12, 18, 20,
30, 36, 38, 48. I need 48, so I've got to stop there. I've got to stop there. So let's
write those. Remember, let's just quickly do that again. For my n value, what will be
the, for the l values, what will be the names? For l equals 0, I'll have s, for 1, 2, 3,
4, 5. I'll have s, p, I'll have a d, I'll have a f, g, h. Okay, so I've got to write that.
This is my primary number. So I've got, I'm going to have 1. For this, I'm going to have
1. Oh, this chalk is terrible. Let's break a piece off and see how it goes. I'll have
1. So this we're going to call s, this we're going to call s, p, s, p, s, d. Where do we
have to go to 2? That's d. So we have to go there. So we're going to have 1s, um, we can
put two electrons in there, can't we? So we're going to have 1s, 2. Then we're going to have
2s, 2. We're going to have 2p, 6. We're going to have 3s, 2. 3s, 2. Here's my 3s, 2. I'm going
to have 3p, 6. 3p, 6. I'm going to have 4s, 2. 4s, 2. I'm going to have 3d, 10. 3d, 10. Let's
carry on. I'm going to have 4p, 6. 4p, 6. 5s, 2. 5s, 2. And we're going to have 4d, 10. 4d, 10. And they are
written in ground state electron configuration for cadmium with an atomic number of 48.
Just a second question we might add to this one is how many electrons can I have? Now remember
my first shell, if I just look at shells and their names, so that will be K, 2, K, L, M,
N, O, P, 3, 4, 5, 6. So in this shell O, I think they call it that, yeah. In this fifth shell,
how many electrons can I have? Now what I need to do, that's N equals 5, I've got to look at
all my N equals 5s. There's one, and there's one, and there's one, and there's one, and that's
that'll be the end of it. So I've got to add all of these. I've got to add 18 to 14, that's
32, that's 42, 48, 50. I can have 50 electrons in this N equals 5 shell. I can have 50 electrons.
So I just added all the five, five principal quantum number equations that I have there.
Okay, this last question on this section, let's see which of these are allowed. The 3s1, is
that an allowed electron ground state configuration, or any, not ground state, but any configuration?
3s1, is that allowed? 3, what does 3 refer to? Well, that is the principal quantum number.
S means L equals 0, so certainly that part is allowed, and as much as the L is less than
the N. And S, you know, as L equals 0, allows two electrons, so that one is correct. D refers
to L equals 2, L equals 2, and I can't have N equals 2 and D equals 2, so that one already
is not allowed. 3s, that means N equals 3, L equals 0, so certainly that's allowed. S equals
0, S means L equals 0, and I'm only allowed two electrons in there, so that one is wrong.
P means L equals 1, so 4, 1 is allowed. 1 can only have 6 electrons. L equals 1 can only
have 6 electrons, so that's not allowed. What is F? Oh, F is, again, where am I? F is
3. So this one is allowed, 5, 3. 3 times 2 is 6. 6 plus 1 is 7. 7 times 2 is 14. I'm allowed
14 electrons there, so everything there works out.
