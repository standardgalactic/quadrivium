The text explains the concept of limits in calculus, emphasizing how they describe the behavior of functions as inputs approach certain points, even if those points are undefined or have different values. Here's a summary:

1. **Limit Basics**: Limits indicate what value a function approaches as its input nears a specific point, without requiring evaluation at that exact point.

2. **Defined Function Example**: For \( f(t) = t^2 \), the limit as \( t \) approaches 2 is 4 because values of \( t^2 \) get closer to 4 as \( t \) nears 2 from both sides.

3. **Limits with Undefined Points**: Some functions are undefined at certain points (e.g., division by zero). For \( f(t) = \frac{t^2 - 4}{t - 2} \), the function is undefined at \( t = 2 \). Simplifying it shows that as \( t \) approaches 2, the limit is 4.

4. **Piecewise Functions**: These functions have different definitions for different parts of their domain. Even if a function takes a specific value at a point (e.g., \( f(t) = 3 \) when \( t = 2 \)), its limit as it approaches that point depends on nearby values, not the exact value.

5. **Conclusion**: Limits capture the behavior of functions near a point, forming a basis for understanding derivatives and integrals in calculus.

Understanding limits is essential because they underpin key concepts like derivatives (rates of change) and integrals (areas under curves).
