The text explains definite integrals, which calculate the area under a curve within specified interval bounds on the x-axis, denoted by "the integral from \(a\) to \(b\)" where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lower and upper bounds, respectively. This is done by evaluating the antiderivative of the function at these bounds and subtracting the results. An example with the function \(y = 1 - x^2\) over the interval from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\) illustrates this process: The antiderivative \(x - \frac{1}{3}x^3\) is evaluated at these bounds, resulting in an area of \(\frac{2}{3}\). This example also shows consistency between definite integrals and the limit of Riemann sums for finding areas under curves. Unlike indefinite integrals, definite integrals do not include a constant \(C\), as they are specific to given intervals.
