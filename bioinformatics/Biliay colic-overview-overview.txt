This video provides an overview of biliary colic associated with gallstone disease. Key points include:

1. **Incidence and Symptoms**: 
   - Gallstones occur in about 9% of women and 6% of men, but only 15% experience biliary colic.
   - There's an 85% chance of recurrent attacks if one occurs, with a small annual risk (2-3%) for complications like cholecystitis.

2. **Pathophysiology**:
   - Biliary colic is caused by gallstones blocking the cystic duct, leading to pain after fatty meals.
   - Pain is typically located in the right upper quadrant and lasts from 30 minutes to several hours.

3. **Diagnosis**:
   - Ultrasound is the main diagnostic tool for identifying gallstones without complications.
   - If initial ultrasound results are negative but symptoms persist, a repeat scan may be needed after two weeks.

4. **Management**:
   - NSAIDs are recommended for pain relief unless contraindicated; cephine can be used as an alternative.
   - Blood tests to check for cholecystitis or pancreatitis and electrolyte monitoring if vomiting occurs are important.

5. **Treatment**:
   - Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment due to high recurrence risk, typically scheduled electively.
   - For those unfit or refusing surgery, expectant management with simple analgesics is advised, along with guidance on when to seek hospital care.

6. **Other Considerations**:
   - Treatments like external beam lithotripsy are ineffective, and cholesterol management does not affect gallstone outcomes.
