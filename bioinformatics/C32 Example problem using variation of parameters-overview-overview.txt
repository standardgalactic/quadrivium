The text provides a detailed explanation of solving a differential equation using the method of variation of parameters. Here's a summary:

1. **Complementary Solution (\(y_c\))**: 
   - The differential equation is second-order linear and homogeneous, likely in the form \(ay'' + by' + cy = 0\).
   - Its complementary solution is given as \(y_c = c_1 \cos(3x) + c_2 \sin(3x)\), where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants.

2. **Particular Solution (\(y_p\))**:
   - The method of variation of parameters is used to find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation.
   - It takes the form \(y_p = u_1(x) y_1(x) + u_2(x) y_2(x)\), with \(y_1(x) = \cos(3x)\) and \(y_2(x) = \sin(3x)\).

3. **Finding \(u_1(x)\) and \(u_2(x)\)**:
   - The derivatives of the functions, \(u_1'\) and \(u_2'\), are calculated using:
     \[
     u_1' = -\frac{y_2(x) g(x)}{W(y_1, y_2)}
     \]
     \[
     u_2' = \frac{y_1(x) g(x)}{W(y_1, y_2)}
     \]
   - Here, \(g(x)\) is the non-homogeneous part of the equation, and \(W(y_1, y_2)\) is their Wronskian.

4. **Calculating the Wronskian**:
   - The Wronskian for \(\cos(3x)\) and \(\sin(3x)\) is calculated as 3.

5. **Integrating to Find \(u_1(x)\) and \(u_2(x)\)**:
   - Integration yields \(u_1(x) = -\frac{1}{12}x\).
   - For \(u_2(x)\), using substitution, the result is \(\frac{1}{36} \ln|\sin(3x)|\).

6. **Constructing the Particular Solution**:
   - The particular solution is formed as:
     \[
     y_p = \left(-\frac{1}{12}x\right) \cos(3x) + \left(\frac{1}{36} \ln|\sin(3x)|\right) \sin(3x)
     \]

7. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution combines both the complementary and particular solutions:
     \[
     y = c_1 \cos(3x) + c_2 \sin(3x) - \frac{1}{12}x \cos(3x) + \frac{1}{36} \ln|\sin(3x)| \sin(3x)
     \]

This summary outlines the steps taken to derive both the complementary and particular solutions, ultimately forming the general solution of the differential equation using variation of parameters.
