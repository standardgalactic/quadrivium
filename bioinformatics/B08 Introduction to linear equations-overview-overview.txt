This text introduces the process of solving first-order linear differential equations by transforming them into a "standard form." In these equations, \( y' \) (the derivative of \( y \)) is multiplied by one function of \( x \), and \( y \) itself is multiplied by another function. By dividing through by the coefficient of \( y' \), the equation simplifies, with \( p(x) = \frac{a_0(x)}{a_1(x)} \) as a key term multiplying \( y' \), and \( f(x) \) appearing on the right side.

The text explains that solutions can be found over intervals where both \( p(x) \) and \( f(x) \) are continuous. It outlines two parts of the solution: \( y_c \), which solves the homogeneous equation (when \( f(x) = 0 \)), and a particular solution (\( y_p \)) for when \( f(x) \neq 0\). To solve the homogeneous part, separation of variables is used, leading to an integrating factor that simplifies solving the standard form. The text emphasizes the importance of this integrating factor in managing such equations.
