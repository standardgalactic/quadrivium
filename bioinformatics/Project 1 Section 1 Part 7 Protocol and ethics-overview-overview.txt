The text underscores the necessity of understanding and following ethical guidelines in medical research across different regions due to varying global regulations. The fundamental principle is that patient safety must never be compromised. For example, retrospective case-control studies using existing data may require ethics approval in some areas, such as South Africa, involving several review stages before proceeding. In contrast, other regions might not have similar requirements. Researchers are advised to thoroughly investigate local ethical protocols and consult with experts to ensure compliance when working with human subjects.
