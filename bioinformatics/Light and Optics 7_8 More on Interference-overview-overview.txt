The text discusses various aspects of Young's double-slit experiment with a focus on calculating interference fringe distances and understanding how different parameters affect these patterns:

1. **Calculating Distance to the Third Bright Fringe:**
   - The setup involves slits 0.12 mm apart, illuminated by red light (wavelength 664 nm), with the screen placed 2.75 meters away.
   - To find the distance from the central bright fringe to the third bright fringe:
     - Use \(\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{M \lambda}{d}\right)\) for \( M = 3 \).
     - Calculate \( D \) using \( D = L \cdot \tan(\theta) \), resulting in approximately 571 nm.

2. **Fringe Separation:**
   - Fringe separation increases with smaller slit separation (\(d\)) or larger wavelength (\(\lambda\)), and decreases with larger \(d\) or smaller \(\lambda\).

3. **Phase Shift and Interference:**
   - A phase shift of half a wavelength swaps bright and dark bands due to changes in interference conditions.

4. **Example Calculation for Eighth Bright Fringe:**
   - Given an 8th fringe path difference (\(\Delta L\)) of 4.57 micrometers:
     - Use \(\Delta L = M \lambda\) with \(M = 8\) to find \(\lambda\):
     - Solving gives \(\lambda = \frac{4.57 \times 10^{-6}}{8} \approx 571 \text{ nm}\).

Overall, the text highlights the importance of understanding how slit separation, wavelength, and path difference influence fringe patterns in double-slit experiments.
