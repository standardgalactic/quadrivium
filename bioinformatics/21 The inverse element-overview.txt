The text introduces the concept of an "inverse element" within a mathematical context, specifically focusing on sets and binary operations. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Set and Binary Operation**: Consider a set with elements \( x \) and a defined binary operation (e.g., multiplication).

2. **Identity Element**: There must be an identity element \( u \) in the set such that for any element \( x \), applying the binary operation between \( x \) and \( u \) returns \( x \).

3. **Inverse Element Definition**: An element \( x_2 \) is defined as the inverse of another element \( x_1 \) if, when they are combined using the binary operation, the result is the identity element \( u \). Mathematically, this means \( x_1 \) operated with \( x_2 \) equals \( u \).

4. **Example**: Using rational numbers and multiplication as the binary operation:
   - If \( x_1 = 3 \), then \( x_2 \) must be \( \frac{1}{3} \) because \( 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \).
   - Here, 1 is the identity element under multiplication.

This explanation provides a foundational understanding of inverse elements in algebraic structures.

The text discusses the concept of an "inverse element" within the context of algebraic structures, specifically when dealing with a set and a binary operation. Here's a summary:

1. **Set and Binary Operation**: We begin with a set of elements denoted by \( x \) and define a binary operation on this set.

2. **Identity Element**: There must be an identity element in the set, represented as \( u \), which satisfies certain properties under the binary operation (e.g., for multiplication, the identity is 1).

3. **Inverse Element Definition**: An element \( x_2 \) is considered the inverse of another element \( x_1 \) if applying the binary operation to both results in the identity element (\( u \)). Mathematically, this means \( x_1 \ast x_2 = u \), where \( \ast \) denotes the binary operation.

4. **Example with Rational Numbers**: The text provides an example using rational numbers and multiplication as the binary operation:
   - If \( x_1 \) is 3, then its inverse under multiplication would be \(\frac{1}{3}\) because \( 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1\), where 1 is the identity element for multiplication.

This explanation highlights how inverse elements function within algebraic systems and offers a clear example to illustrate their properties.
