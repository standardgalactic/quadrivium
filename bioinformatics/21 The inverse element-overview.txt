The text introduces the concept of an "inverse element" within a mathematical context, specifically focusing on sets and binary operations. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Set and Binary Operation**: Consider a set with elements \( x \) and a defined binary operation (e.g., multiplication).

2. **Identity Element**: There must be an identity element \( u \) in the set such that for any element \( x \), applying the binary operation between \( x \) and \( u \) returns \( x \).

3. **Inverse Element Definition**: An element \( x_2 \) is defined as the inverse of another element \( x_1 \) if, when they are combined using the binary operation, the result is the identity element \( u \). Mathematically, this means \( x_1 \) operated with \( x_2 \) equals \( u \).

4. **Example**: Using rational numbers and multiplication as the binary operation:
   - If \( x_1 = 3 \), then \( x_2 \) must be \( \frac{1}{3} \) because \( 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \).
   - Here, 1 is the identity element under multiplication.

This explanation provides a foundational understanding of inverse elements in algebraic structures.
