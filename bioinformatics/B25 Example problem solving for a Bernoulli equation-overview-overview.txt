The text outlines solving a differential equation using Bernoulli's method. The given equation is:

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{xy} = xy^2 \]

To solve this, we use the substitution \( y = u^{-1} \), which transforms the original equation into a linear form because the power of \( y \) (i.e., \( n=2 \)) suggests a Bernoulli equation. This substitution modifies both \( y \) and its derivative, resulting in:

\[ \frac{du}{dx} = -u^{-2}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) \]

The text identifies singular solutionsâ€”those not part of the general solution family characterized by an arbitrary constant. Specifically, setting \( y = 0 \) satisfies the original equation as a singular solution.

After transforming and rearranging terms using the substitution, the equation becomes linear in terms of \( u \). An integrating factor is calculated to be \( x^{-1} \), simplifying integration to yield:

\[ \frac{u}{x} = -x + c_1 \]

Reverting back to \( y \) with the substitution \( y = u^{-1} \), we derive a family of solutions:

\[ y = \frac{1}{cx - x^2} \]

The singular solution \( y=0 \) is separately noted as it cannot be obtained from the general solution for any constant \( c \). Thus, the complete set of solutions includes both the parametric family and the singular case.
