The text discusses the concept of symmetric groups and permutations using a set \( S \) with three elements. A permutation is defined as a bijectionâ€”a one-to-one and onto function that maps a set onto itself. The total number of permutations for a set with \( n \) elements is given by \( n! \) (n factorial). For the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3\} \), there are \( 3! = 6 \) permutations.

The text illustrates these permutations using two notations: array notation and cycle notation. In array notation, each permutation is represented as a sequence showing where each element maps:

1. Identity permutation (\( I \)): \( (1, 2, 3) \rightarrow (1, 2, 3) \)
2. Transposition (\( \tau_{1,2} \)): \( (1, 2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 1, 3) \)
3. Transposition (\( \tau_{1,3} \)): \( (1, 2, 3) \rightarrow (3, 2, 1) \)
4. Transposition (\( \tau_{2,3} \)): \( (1, 2, 3) \rightarrow (1, 3, 2) \)
5. Cycle (\( \sigma \)): \( (1, 2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3, 1) \)
6. Composition of cycles (\( \sigma^2 \)): \( (1, 2, 3) \rightarrow (3, 1, 2) \)

Cycle notation is also introduced to express permutations succinctly by indicating the cycle paths of elements:

- Identity: \( (1)(2)(3) \)
- Transposition (\( \tau_{1,2} \)): \( (1\ 2) \)
- Transposition (\( \tau_{1,3} \)): \( (1\ 3) \)
- Transposition (\( \tau_{2,3} \)): \( (2\ 3) \)
- Cycle (\( \sigma \)): \( (1\ 2\ 3) \)
- Composition of cycles (\( \sigma^2 \)): \( (1\ 3\ 2) \)

The text emphasizes understanding these notations and their roles in symmetric groups, highlighting the importance of function composition.

The text describes permutations and their compositions within the symmetric group \( S_3 \), which consists of all possible permutations of three elements. It explains how to represent permutations using cycle notation and array notation. The key points are:

1. **Cycle Notation**: Describes how elements map to each other in cycles, such as 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, and 3 goes back to 1.

2. **Permutations in \( S_3 \)**: Lists permutations like the identity permutation (I), transpositions (\(\tau_{12}\), \(\tau_{13}\), \(\tau_{23}\)), a 3-cycle (\(\sigma\)), and its square (\(\sigma^2\)).

3. **Composition of Permutations**: Explains how to compose two permutations by applying one after the other, using cycle notation for clarity.

4. **Identity Element**: Demonstrates that composing \(\tau_{12}\) with itself results in the identity permutation (I), indicating that \(\tau_{12}\) is its own inverse.

5. **Group Properties**: Mentions the need to verify group properties such as closure, associativity, existence of an identity element, and inverses for all elements when constructing a multiplication table for \( S_3 \).

The text serves as an introduction to understanding how permutations operate within a symmetric group and emphasizes verifying group axioms.

The text provides an explanation of how to compose permutations using cycle notation on a set with three elements. It demonstrates composing two specific permutations: \(\tau_{1,3}\) followed by \(\tau_{1,2}\). The process is illustrated step-by-step:

1. **Cycle Notation**:
   - \(\tau_{1,2}\): Maps 1 to 2, 2 to 1, and leaves 3 unchanged.
   - \(\tau_{1,3}\): Maps 1 to 3, 3 to 1, and leaves 2 unchanged.

2. **Composing Permutations**:
   - First, apply \(\tau_{1,3}\) followed by \(\tau_{1,2}\):
     - 1 goes to 2 (via \(\tau_{1,2}\)).
     - 2 goes to 3 (via \(\tau_{1,3}\)).
     - 3 goes back to 1.
   - This results in the permutation \((1\ 2\ 3)\), denoted as \(\sigma\).

3. **Symmetric Group**:
   - The set of all permutations on three elements forms a group under composition, known as the symmetric group \(S_3\).
   - This group has six elements: the identity permutation \(E\), \(\tau_{1,2}\), \(\tau_{1,3}\), \(\tau_{2,3}\), \(\sigma = (1\ 2\ 3)\), and \(\sigma^2 = (1\ 3\ 2)\).
   - The group satisfies the four properties:
     - **Closure**: Any composition of permutations results in another permutation within the set.
     - **Associativity**: Composition is associative.
     - **Identity Element**: The identity permutation \(E\) leaves elements unchanged.
     - **Inverses**: Each permutation has an inverse that, when composed with it, yields the identity.

The text concludes by confirming that these properties validate the structure as a symmetric group.
