The text discusses various risk factors impacting pulmonary complications in the context of surgery:

1. **Smoking**: It significantly increases the risk for pulmonary issues, especially mechanical ventilation needs. Smokers with FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) less than 40% are at higher risk for bronchospasm. Patients should stop smoking at least eight weeks before elective surgery to reduce risks.

2. **Asthma**: Considered an important risk factor when patients show active symptoms like wheezing or reduced peak flow (below 80%). Poorly controlled asthma, indicated by morning coughs, steroid therapy, hospitalizations for nebulization, and recent infections, increases the risk of bronchospasm during intubation.

3. **Recent Infections**: Upper respiratory tract infections warrant delaying surgery for two weeks, while lower respiratory tract infections necessitate a four-week delay before surgery to reduce complications.

4. **Obesity**: It contributes to pulmonary risks through factors like difficult airway management and obstructive sleep apnea, potentially leading to prolonged ICU stays.

5. **Surgery Duration and Site**: Longer surgeries and upper abdominal procedures carry higher pulmonary risk compared to lower abdominal ones.

6. **Nutritional Status and Renal Function**: Low albumin levels and poor renal function are predictors of complications, with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) being more relevant than serum creatinine levels for assessing kidney health. Acute renal injury is defined by changes in GFR or creatinine post-surgery.

7. **Post-operative Pain**: Can lead to patient immobilization, increasing the risk of atelectasis and infection.

8. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Particularly potassium disturbances can affect muscle function and cardiac rhythm, impacting recovery and weaning from ventilation.

These factors collectively influence pre-operative assessments and management strategies to minimize pulmonary complications during surgery.
