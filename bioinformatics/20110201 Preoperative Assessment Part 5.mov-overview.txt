The text discusses various risk factors impacting pulmonary complications in the context of surgery:

1. **Smoking**: It significantly increases the risk for pulmonary issues, especially mechanical ventilation needs. Smokers with FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) less than 40% are at higher risk for bronchospasm. Patients should stop smoking at least eight weeks before elective surgery to reduce risks.

2. **Asthma**: Considered an important risk factor when patients show active symptoms like wheezing or reduced peak flow (below 80%). Poorly controlled asthma, indicated by morning coughs, steroid therapy, hospitalizations for nebulization, and recent infections, increases the risk of bronchospasm during intubation.

3. **Recent Infections**: Upper respiratory tract infections warrant delaying surgery for two weeks, while lower respiratory tract infections necessitate a four-week delay before surgery to reduce complications.

4. **Obesity**: It contributes to pulmonary risks through factors like difficult airway management and obstructive sleep apnea, potentially leading to prolonged ICU stays.

5. **Surgery Duration and Site**: Longer surgeries and upper abdominal procedures carry higher pulmonary risk compared to lower abdominal ones.

6. **Nutritional Status and Renal Function**: Low albumin levels and poor renal function are predictors of complications, with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) being more relevant than serum creatinine levels for assessing kidney health. Acute renal injury is defined by changes in GFR or creatinine post-surgery.

7. **Post-operative Pain**: Can lead to patient immobilization, increasing the risk of atelectasis and infection.

8. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Particularly potassium disturbances can affect muscle function and cardiac rhythm, impacting recovery and weaning from ventilation.

These factors collectively influence pre-operative assessments and management strategies to minimize pulmonary complications during surgery.

The text discusses various risk factors affecting pulmonary complications related to surgery. Smoking is highlighted as the second largest risk factor, significantly increasing the risk of pulmonary issues and mechanical ventilation needs. Smokers with an FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) less than 40% are at particularly high risk for bronchospasm. It's advised that smokers quit at least eight weeks before surgery to reduce risks, despite potential increased secretions if they stop shortly before the operation.

Asthma is noted as a third important risk factor, mainly when patients experience active wheezing or have peak flow less than 80%. Poor asthma control indicators include morning coughs, steroid therapy, recent hospitalizations for nebulization, and recurrent infections. Steroid therapy's impact on the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis also influences post-operative care.

Upper respiratory tract infections require a two-week wait before surgery, while lower respiratory tract infections necessitate four weeks. Obesity is discussed as a separate risk factor contributing to pulmonary risks due to complications with airway management and prolonged ICU stays. The duration and site of surgery also affect pulmonary risk, with upper abdominal surgeries being higher risk than lower ones.

Nutritional status, particularly albumin levels, renal function, and post-operative pain management are important considerations. Poorly managed pain can lead to immobilization, increasing risks for atelectasis and infection. Renal function assessment is crucial but often asymptomatic; thus, special investigations may be needed. The focus has shifted from serum creatinine levels to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as a better predictor of renal health.

Electrolyte disturbances, particularly potassium imbalances, can significantly affect patient recovery and mobility post-surgery due to muscle weakness or cardiac dysrhythmias. Lastly, renal failure may be associated with coagulopathies and anemia, further complicating surgical outcomes.
