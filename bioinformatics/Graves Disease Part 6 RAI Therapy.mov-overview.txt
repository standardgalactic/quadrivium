This video discusses the use of radioactive iodine-131 as a treatment for Graves' disease. Introduced in the 1940s, this isotope undergoes beta and gamma decay, with an 8-day half-life. Beta decay destroys tissue, while gamma decay aids in imaging via scintigraphy. The transformation involves converting a neutron to a proton within the iodine nucleus, producing xenon-131, a beta particle, and antineutrinos.

Radioactive iodine is concentrated by the thyroid and can cause side effects like gastritis and salivary adenitis. It crosses into breast milk and the placenta, so its use is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless before fetal thyroid concentration begins at week 12. Concerns about its long-term effects on malignancies, reproductive capacity, and children exist, though evidence is limited.

Treatment with thionamides prior to radioactive iodine can reduce efficacy; however, short-term pre-treatment has minimal impact. Radioactive iodine therapy is often initiated soon after Graves' disease diagnosis but requires initial thionamide use in severe cases. Most patients develop hypothyroidism over time and may experience worsening eye problems (ophthalmopathy), especially with higher doses.

Post-therapy, patients typically see a reduction in thyroid size and thyrotoxicosis symptoms, managed by propranolol and thionamides if needed. A small number of patients might worsen shortly after treatment and require standard management for thyrotoxicosis. If further treatment is necessary, a second dose should not be given before 6 months.

The administration of radioactive iodine involves strict regulations in all countries. Local radiotherapist policies guide its use concerning thionamide co-administration, dosage, patient isolation post-treatment, and follow-up care. The next video will cover surgical resection as another treatment option for Graves' disease.
