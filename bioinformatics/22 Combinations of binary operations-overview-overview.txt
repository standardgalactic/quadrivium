The text explores the concept of distributive properties in binary operations beyond the typical contexts of addition and multiplication. It introduces two types of distributive properties: **left distributive** and **right distributive**.

1. **Left Distributive Property**: A binary operation \(*\) is left distributive over another operation \(+\) if it satisfies:
   \[
   A*(B+C) = (A*B) + (A*C)
   \]
   This means applying \(*\) between \(A\) and the sum of \(B\) and \(C\) gives the same result as performing \(*\) separately with \(A\) and each of \(B\) and \(C\), then adding those results.

2. **Right Distributive Property**: A binary operation \(*\) is right distributive over another operation \(+\) if it satisfies:
   \[
   (B+C)*A = (B*A) + (C*A)
   \]
   This means applying \(*\) between the sum of \(B\) and \(C\) and \(A\) gives the same result as performing \(*\) separately with each of \(B\) and \(C\) and \(A\), then adding those results.

The text uses an example involving integers, where one operation is addition (\(+\)) and the other is defined as \(x^2*y\). It shows that:

- The operation \(x^2*y\) is left distributive over addition because:
  \[
  a*(b+c) = (a^2*b) + (a^2*c)
  \]
  matches the definition of the operation.

- However, it is not right distributive over addition because:
  \[
  (b+c)*a = b^2*a + c^2*a
  \]
  does not match \(b*a + c*a\).

This example illustrates that a binary operation can be left distributive without being right distributive with respect to another operation.
