The text explains the concept of the kernel of a group homomorphism \( F: G \to H \), where \( G \) and \( H \) are groups. The kernel, denoted as \( \text{kernel}(F) \), consists of elements in \( G \) that map to the identity element \( e_H \) in \( H \).

To prove that the kernel is a subgroup of \( G \), three properties must be verified:

1. **Closure**: If \( A, B \in \text{kernel}(F) \), then their product \( A \cdot B \) also belongs to the kernel because \( F(A \cdot B) = e_H \).

2. **Identity**: The identity element of \( G \), \( e_G \), is in the kernel since \( F(e_G) = e_H \).

3. **Inverses**: If \( A \in \text{kernel}(F) \), its inverse \( A^{-1} \) is also in the kernel, as shown by \( F(A^{-1}) = e_H \).

The kernel is also a normal subgroup of \( G \). For any \( g \in G \) and \( h \in \text{kernel}(F) \), the conjugate \( g \cdot h \cdot g^{-1} \) remains in the kernel because \( F(g \cdot h \cdot g^{-1}) = e_H \).

These properties of the kernel contribute to understanding group structure and are foundational for the First Isomorphism Theorem, which connects homomorphisms with quotient groups and isomorphic structures.
