The text outlines the process of evaluating a line integral with respect to \( y \). The differential \( dy \) is expressed as \( 2t + 1 \), simplified to \( 2 \, dt \). The integral is computed from 0 to 1 for the function \( (2t^2 + 2 + t) \cdot 2 \, dt \). By factoring out the constant 2, the integral becomes \( 2 \times \int (2t^2 + 2 + t) \, dt \). After performing the integration, the result is found to be \( 7/3 \).
