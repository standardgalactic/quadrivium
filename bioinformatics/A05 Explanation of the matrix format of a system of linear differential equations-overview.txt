The text discusses solving a system of differential equations represented by matrix transformations. It defines a transformation where \( x' \) and \( y' \) are expressed as linear combinations of \( x \) and \( y \): specifically, \( x' = x + 3y \) and \( y' = 5x + 3y \). These equations form a system that must be solved together.

The solution involves finding values for \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) such that they satisfy both differential equations. The proposed solutions are expressed in terms of exponential functions: \( x(t) = e^{-2t} \) and \( y(t) = -e^{-2t} \). To verify these solutions, the text substitutes them back into the expressions for \( x' \) and \( y' \), confirming that they satisfy the system.

Additionally, it mentions an eigenvalue (\( \lambda_2 = 6 \)) which can also be used to find a solution set. Both approaches lead to consistent results, demonstrating the correctness of the solutions.

The text is discussing a system of differential equations involving two variables, \( x \) and \( y \). The transformation described suggests that:

\[ x' = x + 3y \]
\[ y' = 5x + 3y \]

This forms a system where both equations need to be solved simultaneously. Traditionally, differential equation problems are tackled individually, but this is a coupled system.

The solution involves expressing \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) in terms of exponential functions, specifically:

\[ x = e^{-2t} \]
\[ y = -e^{-2t} \]

To verify the correctness, when these expressions are substituted back into the original equations, they satisfy both transformed equations. Additionally, testing with another eigenvalue, \( \lambda_2 = 6 \), yields a solution set that results in equivalent outcomes.

This demonstrates solving the system using eigenvalues and eigenvectors for differential equations, providing two functions that describe the behavior of the variables over time.
