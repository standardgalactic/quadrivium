The text discusses solving a system of differential equations represented by matrix transformations. It defines a transformation where \( x' \) and \( y' \) are expressed as linear combinations of \( x \) and \( y \): specifically, \( x' = x + 3y \) and \( y' = 5x + 3y \). These equations form a system that must be solved together.

The solution involves finding values for \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) such that they satisfy both differential equations. The proposed solutions are expressed in terms of exponential functions: \( x(t) = e^{-2t} \) and \( y(t) = -e^{-2t} \). To verify these solutions, the text substitutes them back into the expressions for \( x' \) and \( y' \), confirming that they satisfy the system.

Additionally, it mentions an eigenvalue (\( \lambda_2 = 6 \)) which can also be used to find a solution set. Both approaches lead to consistent results, demonstrating the correctness of the solutions.
