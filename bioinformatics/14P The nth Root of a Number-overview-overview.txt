The text explains the process of finding the fourth roots of the complex number \(-8 + 8\sqrt{3}i\) using polar form and both algebraic and geometric methods.

1. **Polar Form Conversion**: The complex number is expressed in polar form with a magnitude \( r = 16 \) (calculated from \(\sqrt{(-8)^2 + (8\sqrt{3})^2}\)) and an argument \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\), as it lies in the second quadrant.

2. **Finding Roots Using Polar Form**:
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th roots is used: 
     \[
     z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right)
     \]
   - For \( n = 4 \), the magnitude of each root is \( r^{1/4} = 2 \).
   - Calculate each root for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \):
     - \( k=0 \): \(\sqrt{3} + i\)
     - \( k=1 \): \(-1 - i\sqrt{3}\)
     - \( k=2 \): \(-\sqrt{3} + i\)
     - \( k=3 \): \(1 - i\sqrt{3}\)

3. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - The roots are visualized as points on the complex plane, spaced evenly by 90 degrees (\(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians).
   - Starting from \(\sqrt{3} + i\), each subsequent root is found by rotating this point counterclockwise around the origin.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The fourth roots of \(-8 + 8\sqrt{3}i\) are confirmed to be: 
     - \(\sqrt{3} + i\)
     - \(-1 - i\sqrt{3}\)
     - \(-\sqrt{3} + i\)
     - \(1 - i\sqrt{3}\)

This approach combines algebraic calculations with geometric visualization, providing a thorough understanding of finding complex roots.
