The text explains how to determine the position and size of a solar image using a concave spherical mirror with a 400 cm radius. The key points are:

1. **Solar Image Formation**:
   - Due to the Sun's large distance, \( \frac{1}{S_0} \approx 0 \).
   - Using the mirror equation \( \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_I} = -\frac{2}{R} \), the image forms at the focal point (2.0 m from the mirror) since for large \( S_0 \), \( S_I \approx \frac{R \cdot S_0}{2S_0 + R} \).

2. **Image Size**:
   - The height of the Sun's image is calculated as \( Y_I = 9.3 \times 10^{-3} \) meters using similar triangles and trigonometry.
   - The angle subtended by the image matches that from the Sun, confirming its size.

3. **Dentist's Mirror**:
   - A concave mirror with a magnification of 4.0 is used to view a tooth at 0.6 cm distance.
   - Using \( M = -\frac{S_I}{S_0} \), the image distance \( S_I = -0.024 \) meters (virtual).
   - The radius of curvature is calculated as negative 1.6 cm, indicating a concave mirror.
   - The image is virtual, upright, and enlarged, typical when the object is between the focal point and the mirror.

The text applies geometric optics principles to analyze image formation by concave mirrors in these scenarios.
