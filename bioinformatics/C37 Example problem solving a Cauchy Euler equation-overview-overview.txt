The text provides a method for solving a differential equation by assuming a solution of the form \(y = x^m\). The first and second derivatives are calculated and substituted into the differential equation, leading to an algebraic equation involving \(m\):

\[4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 0.\]

This quadratic equation factors as \((2m + 1)^2 = 0\), resulting in a repeated root:

\[m = -\frac{1}{2}.\]

Given the repeated nature of the root, the general solution incorporates both \(x^{-1/2}\) and an additional term multiplied by \(\ln(x)\). The complete solution is expressed as:

\[y = c_1 x^{-1/2} + c_2 x^{-1/2} \ln(x).\]

This approach addresses differential equations with constant coefficients, specifically when repeated roots occur.
