The text provides an explanation of how to calculate the electric field from the electric potential and demonstrates this through examples.

1. **Basic Concept**: The relationship between work done by the electric field and changes in electric potential (\(V\)) is explored. Work done (\(dW\)) can be expressed as \(-Q_0 dV\) (negative charge times change in potential). Using \(dW = F \cdot ds\), where \(F\) is force, and substituting \(F = Q_0 E\), we get \(-Q_0 dV = Q_0 E \cos(\theta) ds\).

2. **Derivation**: Simplifying this relation results in \(E \cos(\theta) = -\frac{dV}{ds}\), indicating that the component of electric field along displacement is related to the rate of change of potential with distance.

3. **Uniform Electric Field Example**:
   - For a uniform electric field, this simplifies further to \(E = -\Delta V / \Delta s\).
   - Applied to parallel plates 1.2 cm apart (0.012 m), where one plate is at zero volts and halfway between the plates it's five volts: 
     \[
     E = -\frac{5.0 \, \text{V} - 0}{0.006 \, \text{m}} = -833.33 \, \text{V/m}
     \]
   - The electric field direction is from positive to negative plate.

4. **Non-Uniform Field Example**:
   - Given \( V = 2x^2 - 3y^2 \), the electric field components are found using partial derivatives:
     - \(E_x = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = -4x\). At \(x = 3\, \text{m}\): \(E_x = -12 \, \text{V/m}\).
     - \(E_y = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial y} = +6y\). At \(y = 2\, \text{m}\): \(E_y = +12 \, \text{V/m}\).

Thus, the electric field at point (3 m, 2 m) in unit vector notation is \(-12 \hat{i} + 12 \hat{j} \, \text{V/m}\).

The text discusses concepts related to electric potential, electric fields, and work done on charges. It begins by calculating an electric field vector with a given magnitude (12 volts per meter) and direction (negative i direction plus j direction). The discussion then moves to the concept of electric potential energy and its relationship with work and charge.

Electric potential is defined as the work done per unit charge to move a test charge from infinity to a point in space, with zero potential energy at infinity. When introducing multiple charges into this scenario, one must consider the existing electric field created by other charges already present.

The text provides an expression for the electric potential at a distance \( r \) from a point charge: 

\[
V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{r}
\]

where \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space. The work done to bring additional charges into this field involves calculating potential energy changes due to interactions with existing charges.

For a system of multiple charges, the total electric potential at any point is the algebraic sum of potentials due to each charge, considering the sign (positive or negative) depending on whether like charges repel (positive work) or opposite charges attract (negative work).

In summary, the text explains how to calculate and understand electric fields, potentials, and the work involved in assembling a system of charged particles, with an emphasis on vector components and algebraic signs.

The text explains how to calculate the electric field (\(E\)) when given the electric potential (\(V\)). The relationship between work done by an electric field and changes in potential is key: \(-Q_0 dV = Q_0 E \cos(\theta) ds\), where \(dV\) represents a change in electric potential, \(ds\) is a differential displacement vector, and \(\theta\) is the angle between the electric field and displacement vectors. Simplifying for uniform fields, the component of \(E\) along \(S\) (displacement) can be expressed as \(-\frac{dV}{ds}\).

For a specific case with two large parallel plates separated by 1.2 cm with opposite charges, where the potential midway between them is +5 V and the negative plate's potential is set to 0 V, the constant electric field \(E\) can be calculated as \(-\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta x}\). Here, \(\Delta V = -5.0\) volts (from \(+5\) to \(0\)) over a distance of 0.06 meters, giving an electric field in the negative x-direction.

Another example involves calculating \(E\) from a given potential function \(V = 2x^2 - 3y^2\). Using partial derivatives:

- The \(x\)-component is found by \(-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = -4x\), evaluated at \(x=3\), resulting in \(-12\) volts/meter.
- The \(y\)-component is \(-\frac{\partial V}{\partial y} = +6y\), evaluated at \(y=2\), giving \(+12\) volts/meter.

Thus, the electric field at point (3 m, 2 m) is expressed as \(\mathbf{E} = -12 \hat{i} + 12 \hat{j}\) volts/meter.

The text discusses concepts related to electric potential, potential energy, and work done in an electric field. Here's a summary:

1. **Electric Field Calculation**: 
   - Given 6 volts per square meter times y (where y = 2), the result is 12 volts per meter. This is represented as a vector \( \mathbf{e} = -12\hat{i} + 12\hat{j} \) volts per meter.

2. **Electric Potential and Work**:
   - Electric potential is defined as work done per unit charge, leading to the formula for electric potential energy.
   - Bringing a test charge into an existing field requires work if there's already an electric field present.

3. **Potential Due to Point Charges**:
   - The potential \( V \) at a distance \( r \) from a point charge is given by \( V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} \).
   - Work done in bringing a charge into this field can be calculated using the formula: \( W = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \).

4. **System of Multiple Charges**:
   - For multiple charges, the total electric potential is the sum of potentials due to each charge.
   - The work done in bringing a third charge into the system involves calculating contributions from existing charges.

5. **Signs and Algebraic Addition/Subtraction**:
   - Positive work is done when like charges are brought together, while negative work occurs with opposite charges.
   - These principles guide the algebraic addition or subtraction of potentials based on charge signs.
