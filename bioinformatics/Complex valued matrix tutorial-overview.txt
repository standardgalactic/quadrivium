Let's continue the matrix multiplication process for \( A \times C \), where

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 + i & 3 \\ 2 + i & -i & 7 \end{bmatrix} \]

and 

\[ C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 + 2i \\ i & 1 \end{bmatrix}. \]

Since \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 3 \) matrix and \( C \) is a \( 3 \times 2 \) matrix, the resulting matrix will be \( 2 \times 2 \).

### First Row, First Column:

\[ (1 \cdot 1) + ((2+i) \cdot 2) + (3 \cdot i) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- \( (2+i) \cdot 2 = 4 + 2i \)
- \( 3 \cdot i = 3i \)

Adding these together:

\[ 1 + (4 + 2i) + 3i = 5 + 5i \]

### First Row, Second Column:

\[ (1 \cdot (4+2i)) + ((2+i) \cdot 1) + (3 \cdot 1) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot (4+2i) = 4 + 2i \)
- \( (2+i) \cdot 1 = 2 + i \)
- \( 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \)

Adding these together:

\[ (4 + 2i) + (2 + i) + 3 = 9 + 3i \]

### Second Row, First Column:

\[ ((2+i) \cdot 1) + (-i \cdot 2) + (7 \cdot i) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( (2+i) \cdot 1 = 2 + i \)
- \( -i \cdot 2 = -2i \)
- \( 7 \cdot i = 7i \)

Adding these together:

\[ (2 + i) + (-2i) + 7i = 2 + 6i \]

### Second Row, Second Column:

\[ ((2+i) \cdot (4+2i)) + (-i \cdot 1) + (7 \cdot 1) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( (2+i) \cdot (4+2i) = 8 + 4i + 4i + 2i^2 = 8 + 8i + 2(-1) = 6 + 8i \)
- \( -i \cdot 1 = -i \)
- \( 7 \cdot 1 = 7 \)

Adding these together:

\[ (6 + 8i) + (-i) + 7 = 13 + 7i \]

### Resulting Matrix

Putting it all together, the resulting matrix from \( A \times C \) is:

\[
A \times C = \begin{bmatrix} 5 + 5i & 9 + 3i \\ 2 + 6i & 13 + 7i \end{bmatrix}
\]

The text describes a process involving complex numbers and matrix multiplication, emphasizing the ease of making arithmetic errors when doing such calculations manually. It walks through specific multiplications and additions:

1. **Basic Operations:**
   - \(2I + 2I = 4I\)
   - \(I \times I = -1\)
   - \(3 \times 1 = 3\)

2. **Matrix Multiplication Steps:**
   - Calculating entries in a matrix by multiplying and adding complex numbers:
     - For one entry, the calculation is \(1 \times 2 + I = 2 + I\).
     - Another involves subtracting complex parts, resulting in \(-2I\).
     - Multiplications like \(7 \times 4 = 28\) and \(7 \times 2 = 14\) are shown.
     - Combining terms yields results such as \(8 + 17 + 8I\) for some entries.

3. **Encouragement to Use Python:**
   - The text encourages using Python for these calculations, highlighting that it minimizes the chance of errors and simplifies the process compared to manual arithmetic.

Overall, the passage underscores both the complexity of handling complex numbers in matrix operations manually and the advantages of using computational tools like Python to perform such tasks accurately.

To perform matrix multiplication between matrices \( A \) and \( C \), we need to follow the standard procedure for multiplying two matrices. Here are the given matrices:

Matrix \( A \):
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 + i & 3 \\
2 + i & -i & 7
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Matrix \( C \):
\[
C = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 + 2i \\
i & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The dimensions of \( A \) are \( 2 \times 3 \), and the dimensions of \( C \) are \( 2 \times 2 \). For matrix multiplication to be defined, the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. Here, \( A \) has 3 columns, and \( C \) has 2 rows, so \( A \times C \) is not defined.

However, if we consider multiplying \( C \) by \( A \), i.e., \( C \times A \), then:

- Matrix \( C \) has dimensions \( 2 \times 2 \).
- Matrix \( A \) has dimensions \( 2 \times 3 \).

Since the number of columns in \( C \) (which is 2) matches the number of rows in \( A \) (which is also 2), the multiplication \( C \times A \) is defined. The resulting matrix will have dimensions \( 2 \times 3 \).

Let's compute \( C \times A \):

\[
C \times A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 + 2i \\
i & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\times
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 + i & 3 \\
2 + i & -i & 7
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The resulting matrix will be:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
(1 \times 1) + ((4 + 2i) \times (2 + i)) & (1 \times (2 + i)) + ((4 + 2i) \times (-i)) & (1 \times 3) + ((4 + 2i) \times 7) \\
(i \times 1) + (1 \times (2 + i)) & (i \times (2 + i)) + (1 \times (-i)) & (i \times 3) + (1 \times 7)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Let's compute each element:

1. First row, first column:
   \[
   1 \cdot 1 + (4 + 2i)(2 + i) = 1 + (8 + 4i + 2i + 2i^2) = 1 + (8 + 6i - 2) = 7 + 6i
   \]

2. First row, second column:
   \[
   1 \cdot (2 + i) + (4 + 2i)(-i) = 2 + i - 4i - 2i^2 = 2 - 3i + 2 = 4 - 3i
   \]

3. First row, third column:
   \[
   1 \cdot 3 + (4 + 2i) \cdot 7 = 3 + (28 + 14i) = 31 + 14i
   \]

4. Second row, first column:
   \[
   i \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (2 + i) = i + 2 + i = 2 + 2i
   \]

5. Second row, second column:
   \[
   i \cdot (2 + i) + 1 \cdot (-i) = 2i + i^2 - i = 2i - 1 - i = -1 + i
   \]

6. Second row, third column:
   \[
   i \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 7 = 3i + 7
   \]

Thus, the resulting matrix \( C \times A \) is:

\[
C \times A = \begin{bmatrix}
7 + 6i & 4 - 3i & 31 + 14i \\
2 + 2i & -1 + i & 7 + 3i
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The text describes a step-by-step process for performing matrix multiplication, involving complex numbers and standard arithmetic. The operations involve calculating specific elements in the resulting matrix by multiplying corresponding rows and columns from two matrices. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Complex Number Operations**: 
   - \(2I + 2I\) simplifies to \(4I\).
   - \(I \times I = -1\).

2. **Matrix Multiplication Steps**:
   - Calculating elements in specific rows and columns, such as \(1 \times 2 + I = 2 + I\), and handling complex numbers like \(-I\) or positive terms from negative signs.
   - Combining results to form new matrix elements.

3. **Continuing Calculations**: 
   - Adding further calculated values for different matrix positions (e.g., \(1+4=5\) and dealing with coefficients of imaginary parts).

4. **Final Steps**:
   - Summing up real and imaginary components separately for each element.
   - Emphasis on accuracy due to the simplicity but error-prone nature of manual calculations.

The text concludes by suggesting using Python for matrix multiplication to avoid errors, highlighting its ease and reliability compared to manual methods.
