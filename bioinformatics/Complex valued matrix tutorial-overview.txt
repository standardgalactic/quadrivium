Let's continue the matrix multiplication process for \( A \times C \), where

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 + i & 3 \\ 2 + i & -i & 7 \end{bmatrix} \]

and 

\[ C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 + 2i \\ i & 1 \end{bmatrix}. \]

Since \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 3 \) matrix and \( C \) is a \( 3 \times 2 \) matrix, the resulting matrix will be \( 2 \times 2 \).

### First Row, First Column:

\[ (1 \cdot 1) + ((2+i) \cdot 2) + (3 \cdot i) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- \( (2+i) \cdot 2 = 4 + 2i \)
- \( 3 \cdot i = 3i \)

Adding these together:

\[ 1 + (4 + 2i) + 3i = 5 + 5i \]

### First Row, Second Column:

\[ (1 \cdot (4+2i)) + ((2+i) \cdot 1) + (3 \cdot 1) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot (4+2i) = 4 + 2i \)
- \( (2+i) \cdot 1 = 2 + i \)
- \( 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \)

Adding these together:

\[ (4 + 2i) + (2 + i) + 3 = 9 + 3i \]

### Second Row, First Column:

\[ ((2+i) \cdot 1) + (-i \cdot 2) + (7 \cdot i) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( (2+i) \cdot 1 = 2 + i \)
- \( -i \cdot 2 = -2i \)
- \( 7 \cdot i = 7i \)

Adding these together:

\[ (2 + i) + (-2i) + 7i = 2 + 6i \]

### Second Row, Second Column:

\[ ((2+i) \cdot (4+2i)) + (-i \cdot 1) + (7 \cdot 1) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( (2+i) \cdot (4+2i) = 8 + 4i + 4i + 2i^2 = 8 + 8i + 2(-1) = 6 + 8i \)
- \( -i \cdot 1 = -i \)
- \( 7 \cdot 1 = 7 \)

Adding these together:

\[ (6 + 8i) + (-i) + 7 = 13 + 7i \]

### Resulting Matrix

Putting it all together, the resulting matrix from \( A \times C \) is:

\[
A \times C = \begin{bmatrix} 5 + 5i & 9 + 3i \\ 2 + 6i & 13 + 7i \end{bmatrix}
\]

The text describes a process involving complex numbers and matrix multiplication, emphasizing the ease of making arithmetic errors when doing such calculations manually. It walks through specific multiplications and additions:

1. **Basic Operations:**
   - \(2I + 2I = 4I\)
   - \(I \times I = -1\)
   - \(3 \times 1 = 3\)

2. **Matrix Multiplication Steps:**
   - Calculating entries in a matrix by multiplying and adding complex numbers:
     - For one entry, the calculation is \(1 \times 2 + I = 2 + I\).
     - Another involves subtracting complex parts, resulting in \(-2I\).
     - Multiplications like \(7 \times 4 = 28\) and \(7 \times 2 = 14\) are shown.
     - Combining terms yields results such as \(8 + 17 + 8I\) for some entries.

3. **Encouragement to Use Python:**
   - The text encourages using Python for these calculations, highlighting that it minimizes the chance of errors and simplifies the process compared to manual arithmetic.

Overall, the passage underscores both the complexity of handling complex numbers in matrix operations manually and the advantages of using computational tools like Python to perform such tasks accurately.
