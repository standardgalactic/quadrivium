This lecture explains how to use Seaborn in Python for enhanced data visualization. Seaborn works alongside Matplotlib and improves the appearance of plots, making them suitable for publication. The instructions are applicable across Linux (e.g., Linux Mint 17.1), macOS, and Windows systems.

For Linux and macOS users, access is through the Terminal program. On Windows, use the Command Prompt, accessible via Start or Search menus. A key requirement is having Python installed via Anaconda version 3.4, which includes PIPâ€”a package manager used to install additional modules like Seaborn. If using another Python version without PIP pre-installed, users will need to find instructions to set it up.

Once PIP is available (via Anaconda), install Seaborn by running the command `pip install seaborn` in your terminal or command prompt. This may require administrator privileges, potentially prompting for a password. The installation process involves downloading and setting up Seaborn automatically using these steps.
