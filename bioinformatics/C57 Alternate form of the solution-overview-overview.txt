The text explains an alternative way of representing simple harmonic motion (SHM). Traditionally, SHM is expressed as \( x(t) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t) \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. An equivalent representation uses amplitude and phase angle: \( A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \). Here, \( A \) is the amplitude, and \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

This alternative form relates to viewing uniform circular motion from the side, emphasizing how initial conditions (like velocity) affect perception of amplitude. Amplitude in this context is derived from both components \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

To show these representations are equivalent, trigonometric identities link \( A \), \( \phi \), \( c_1 \), and \( c_2 \):
- The amplitude \( A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} \).
- The sine of the phase angle is given by \( \sin(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{A} \).
- The cosine of the phase angle is \( \cos(\phi) = \frac{c_2}{A} \).

By substituting these into the sine and cosine terms, it's demonstrated that both forms describe the same motion. If thereâ€™s a non-zero \( c_2 \), indicating initial velocity or a phase angle, the phase angle \( \phi \) can be found using:
- \( \tan(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{c_2} \).

This shows how amplitude and phase are related to the original coefficients in SHM.
