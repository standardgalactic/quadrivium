This lecture covers using NumPy for simple calculus with polynomials. It highlights key features:

1. **Polynomial Definition**: Polynomials are single-variable functions where the variable is raised to integer powers (e.g., \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \)).

2. **Creating Polynomials in Python**: Using NumPy's `poly1d`, you can define polynomials by listing coefficients from highest to lowest power of x, facilitating easy manipulation.

3. **Operations on Polynomials**:
   - **Multiplication**: Multiplying a polynomial by itself results in a new polynomial.
   - **Derivative**: The `deriv` method computes the first derivative.
   - **Integration**: The `integ` method allows integration with manual addition of the constant of integration.

4. **Practical Application**: These operations enable quick verification of calculus work, such as checking derivatives and integrals on a computer.
