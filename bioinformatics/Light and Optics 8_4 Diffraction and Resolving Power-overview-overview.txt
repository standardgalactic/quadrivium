The text discusses three distinct optical problems illustrating resolving power and diffraction effects:

1. **Resolving Power of Stars:** It involves determining the maximum distance at which two stars, 1.2 x 10^12 meters apart and observed in light with a wavelength of 515 nanometers using a telescope with a 1.02-meter lens, can still be distinguished as separate entities. This is calculated using the formula for the minimum resolvable angle (\(\theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \times \frac{\lambda}{D}\)), which helps find the corresponding arc length and maximum distance.

2. **Inkjet Printer Problem:** The focus here is on determining how far an observer can be from a printed page before they can no longer distinguish individual colored dots (red, green, blue). Given a pupil diameter of 3 mm and the wavelengths for each color (660 nm for red, 550 nm for green, and 470 nm for blue), the calculation shows that the dots should not be more than 115 micrometers apart to avoid being resolved.

3. **Laser Beam to the Moon:** This problem involves sending a laser beam with a diameter of 0.2 meters and wavelength of 694.3 nm to the moon, which is 3.77 x 10^8 meters away. The task is to calculate the width of the central bright fringe when the beam reflects off the moon's surface. Using diffraction principles, specifically calculating the angle to the first dark fringe (\(\theta = \arcsin(\frac{\lambda}{D})\)), it is determined that the diameter of the central spot on the moon exceeds 2.5 kilometers.

These examples highlight how optical resolution and diffraction are calculated using parameters like wavelength, aperture size, and distance in different practical scenarios.
