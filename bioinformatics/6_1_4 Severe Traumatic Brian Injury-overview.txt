The text discusses the use of propofol and barbiturates in managing intracranial pressure, especially when other treatments like mannitol or surgical options fail. Propofol offers advantages such as a short half-life, allowing quick neurological assessment after discontinuation. However, it can cause hypotension and decreased perfusion pressure, potentially reducing brain circulation despite lowering intracranial pressure. Prolonged use may lead to hyperlipidemia, and propofol is not recommended for pediatric patients.

Barbiturate coma is considered for hemodynamically stable patients with severe traumatic brain injury when other therapies fail. Barbiturates decrease metabolism and inhibit lipid peroxidation but have poorly correlated therapeutic benefits and systemic complications with serum concentration. They require an extended period off the medication to perform reliable neurological examinations.

The management of traumatic brain injuries also involves seizure prophylaxis, distinguishing between early (within seven days) and late onset seizures. Drugs like phenytoin can prevent early post-traumatic seizures but not late ones, nor do they affect mortality rates. Late seizures are treated as new onset epilepsy. Phenytoin may cause drug-induced fever within one to eight weeks of therapy initiation, complicating management due to its nature as a diagnosis of exclusion.
