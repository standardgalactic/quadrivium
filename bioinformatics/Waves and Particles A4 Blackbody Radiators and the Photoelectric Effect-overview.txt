The text describes a physics problem involving the photoelectric effect and thermal energy calculations:

1. **Photoelectric Effect Problem:**
   - Initially, light with a wavelength of 221 nanometers is used on a metal surface, resulting in ejected electrons with a maximum kinetic energy of \(3.28 \times 10^{-19}\) joules.
   - The goal is to find the new wavelength required to double this kinetic energy while using the same metal.
   - Using the photoelectric equation: 
     \[
     KE_{\text{max}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi
     \]
     where \(KE_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum kinetic energy, \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\lambda\) is the wavelength, and \(\phi\) is the work function.
   - By setting up equations for both initial and doubled kinetic energies, it is determined that a wavelength of 162 nanometers will achieve this.

2. **Thermal Energy Problem:**
   - A glass plate with a mass of 0.5 kg and specific heat capacity of 840 J/kg·K needs its temperature raised by 2 K using infrared light (\(\lambda = 6.0 \times 10^{-5}\) m).
   - The energy required is calculated using \(Q = mc\Delta T\), resulting in 840 joules.
   - The energy per photon of the infrared light is found using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\).
   - Dividing the total energy needed by the energy per photon gives approximately \(2.5 \times 10^{23}\) photons.

3. **Melting Ice Problem:**
   - To melt 2 kg of ice at 0°C using light with a wavelength of 620 nm, the latent heat of fusion (\(L_F = 33.5 \times 10^4\) J/kg) is used.
   - The energy required to melt the ice is calculated as \(Q = mL_F\), resulting in 67000 joules.
   - Using the energy per photon formula, the number of photons needed is approximately \(2.1 \times 10^{24}\).

These problems illustrate applications of the photoelectric effect and thermal energy concepts.
