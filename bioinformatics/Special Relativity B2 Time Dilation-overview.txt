The scenario you've described involves time dilation as predicted by Einstein's theory of special relativity. This effect becomes significant when particles move at velocities close to the speed of light (denoted as \( c \)). Let’s break down your description and calculations:

### Key Concepts

1. **Time Dilation**: According to special relativity, a moving clock runs slower compared to one that is stationary relative to an observer. This effect becomes pronounced at relativistic speeds.

2. **Proper Time (\( \Delta t_0 \))**: This is the time interval measured by an observer who is in the same inertial frame as the event being observed (e.g., the lifespan of a muon from its own perspective).

3. **Dilated Time (\( \Delta t \))**: This is the time interval as measured by an observer moving relative to the clock or particle.

4. **Lorentz Factor**: The factor by which time, length, and relativistic mass change for an object while that object is moving is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   where \( v \) is the velocity of the object.

### Applying to Muons

- **Proper Time (\( \Delta t_0 \))**: For a muon, this is its natural lifespan when at rest, which is 2.2 microseconds (\( 2.2 \times 10^{-6} \) seconds).

- **Velocity of the Muon (\( v \))**: Given as \( 0.998c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.

#### Time Dilation Calculation

1. **Calculate Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.998)^2}} \approx 15.8
   \]

2. **Dilated Time (\( \Delta t \))**:
   \[
   \Delta t = \gamma \cdot \Delta t_0 = 15.8 \times 2.2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \approx 34.76 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} 
   \]
   This is approximately 34.8 microseconds.

#### Distance Traveled

- **Distance (\( d \))**: Using the formula \( d = v \cdot \Delta t \):
  \[
  d = 0.998c \times 34.76 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s}
  \]
  \[
  d \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 34.76 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \approx 10,428 \, \text{meters}
  \]

This calculation shows that due to time dilation, muons created in the upper atmosphere can indeed reach the Earth's surface despite their short natural lifespan.

### Conclusion

Time dilation allows these high-speed muons to travel much further than they would if moving at non-relativistic speeds. This phenomenon is crucial for detecting cosmic rays and understanding particle interactions both naturally occurring in space and artificially produced in accelerators like CERN’s LHC.

The text discusses the significance of muons in scientific research. Muons are crucial for measuring energies released during high-energy collisions, such as those involving hadrons or protons, which aids in searching for phenomena like ex-bosons. Although a muon's natural lifespan is short, its life appears extended from an observer's perspective when it travels at speeds close to the speed of light. This relativistic effect makes muons valuable in experiments and practical applications despite their brief existence.
