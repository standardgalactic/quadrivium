The lecture explores the differences between parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, focusing on their appropriate use in inferential statistics. Parametric tests assume that sample data come from a normal distribution, making them powerful when this assumption is valid. Non-parametric tests do not require such assumptions about data distribution.

Using Python's `scipy.stats` library, the speaker demonstrates how to assess if a dataset follows a normal distribution via Q-Q plots. These plots show that samples from a normal distribution align well with a line of normality, indicating they are suitable for parametric tests like the Student's t-test. In contrast, samples from an exponential distribution deviate significantly from this line, suggesting non-parametric methods such as the Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test are more appropriate.

The key takeaway is to choose statistical tests based on data distribution: use parametric tests for normally distributed data and non-parametric tests otherwise, ensuring accurate results.
