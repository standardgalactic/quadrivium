The text discusses the concept of "relations" in mathematics, which builds upon product sets. A relation is defined as a subset of the product set formed by pairing elements of a set \(A\) with itself. For example, using the set \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), one can define a "divides" relation where pairs consist of elements that divide each other without remainder, resulting in ordered pairs like (1,1) or (2,2).

Another example involves a set \(A\) with natural numbers from 1 to 20 and defines a relation based on multiplication by 3, creating pairs such as (1,3) or (2,6). The text highlights the use of product set notation for describing these relations and notes that element order in pairs can vary depending on context.

The concept of binary relations is introduced, which involves pairs from \(A\) onto itself, laying groundwork for further exploration of their properties.
