The text discusses the concept of "relations" in mathematics, which builds upon product sets. A relation is defined as a subset of the product set formed by pairing elements of a set \(A\) with itself. For example, using the set \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), one can define a "divides" relation where pairs consist of elements that divide each other without remainder, resulting in ordered pairs like (1,1) or (2,2).

Another example involves a set \(A\) with natural numbers from 1 to 20 and defines a relation based on multiplication by 3, creating pairs such as (1,3) or (2,6). The text highlights the use of product set notation for describing these relations and notes that element order in pairs can vary depending on context.

The concept of binary relations is introduced, which involves pairs from \(A\) onto itself, laying groundwork for further exploration of their properties.

The text explains the concept of "relations" in mathematics by building upon product sets. A relation is defined as a subset of the product set formed by pairing elements within a set \(A\) with each other. For instance, with the set \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), an example of a relation is "divides," where pairs are formed such that one number divides another without a remainder (e.g., (1,1), (2,2)). Another example involves set \(A\) with natural numbers from 1 to 20, using multiplication by 3 as the relation criterion, resulting in pairs like (1,3) or (2,6).

The text highlights the use of product set notation for describing relations and notes that while some texts might order elements differently, both are valid depending on context. It also introduces binary relations, which involve pairs from \(A\) onto itself, as a foundation for exploring their properties further.
