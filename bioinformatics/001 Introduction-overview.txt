The text introduces a lecture series focused on using Python for solving mathematical problems. It highlights Python's power and versatility through its libraries and modules, emphasizing its capability expansion via community-contributed packages. The introduction begins with guidance on downloading Python, noting the choice between versions 2.7.6 and 3.4. The recommendation is to use version 2.7.6 for greater compatibility with existing mathematical libraries.

The text also introduces "vPython," a visual extension ideal for creating graphics and physics simulations in Python. Installation instructions are provided for both Windows and Mac users, mentioning dependencies like TCL 8.6.1 for vPython.

Key Python packages suggested for expanding capabilities include NumPy (numerical calculations), Matplotlib (plotting functions), SciPy (scientific computations), and SymPy (computer algebra system). The text advises careful selection of package versions to ensure compatibility with the installed Python version, particularly recommending stable releases over beta versions or release candidates.

Finally, the introduction covers setting up Python environments across different operating systems: Mac, Windows, and Linux. On Linux, using package managers like those in Ubuntu or Mint can simplify installation. The text concludes by mentioning how to launch Python shells (idle/vidle for Mac) to start coding interactively.
