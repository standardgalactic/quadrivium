The text outlines a method for performing two-dimensional rotations using Python, focusing on symbolic mathematics with libraries like SymPy. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Concepts

1. **Coordinate Transformation**: Changing coordinates through rotation or translation.
2. **Rotation Matrix**: A matrix used to rotate vectors in Euclidean space. For 2D, it rotates counterclockwise by an angle \(\theta\).
3. **Reference Frames**: Describes how vectors transform between different frames of reference, often using mechanics libraries for orientation.
4. **Symbolic Computation with SymPy**: Using Python's SymPy library to manipulate algebraic expressions symbolically.

### Code Explanation

1. **Defining Variables**:
   - Symbols are defined for variables like \(\theta\).

2. **Rotation Matrix in 2D**:
   - A rotation matrix is constructed using trigonometric functions for a counterclockwise rotation by angle \(\theta\).

3. **Applying the Rotation**:
   - Vectors are rotated by multiplying them with the rotation matrix.

4. **Using Reference Frames**:
   - Reference frames can be defined and oriented relative to each other, allowing transformations between frames.

5. **Transformation Between Frames**:
   - Direction cosine matrices are used to transform vectors from one frame to another.

### Summary

- The process involves defining symbolic variables for rotation angles and coordinates.
- A rotation matrix is constructed and applied to vectors to perform transformations.
- Libraries like SymPy facilitate these operations symbolically, useful in physics and engineering contexts.

The text also describes creating a Python function to encapsulate the rotation logic, using a 3x3 matrix for two-dimensional rotations. An example demonstrates inputting values for x, y, and rotation angle, resulting in new coordinates after rotation. The use of Python libraries like SymPy simplifies these mathematical operations, highlighting programming's role in managing complex tasks efficiently.
