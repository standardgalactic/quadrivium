The text outlines a section on solving differential equations using substitution methods when standard techniques such as integrating factors or separation of variables are not applicable. Here's a summary:

1. **Exact Equations**: The concept is briefly revisited where an exact equation satisfies \( \frac{\partial N}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial M}{\partial x} \).

2. **Linear and Separable Equations**: Previous techniques like solving linear equations of the form \( y' = f(x)y + g(x) \) and separating variables are mentioned as familiar methods.

3. **Introduction to Substitutions**: When these standard methods fail, three specific substitutions are introduced for handling more complex differential equations:
   - **First Substitution**: \( y = u(x)x \) or equivalently \( x = vy \), leading to transformed derivatives.
   - **Second Substitution**: Used for homogeneous differential equations where the function satisfies \( f(tx, ty) = t^k f(x, y) \). This substitution simplifies such equations.
   - **Third Substitution**: Applied to Bernoulli's equation of the form \( y' = p(x)y + q(x)y^n \), using \( u = y^{1-n} \).

4. **Homogeneous Differential Equations**: Defined by the property that both functions in the differential form scale similarly with a factor \( t^k \). These are not necessarily exact, requiring substitutions for solution.

5. **Bernoulli's Equation**: A specific type of nonlinear equation that can be transformed into a linear one using an appropriate substitution when \( n \neq 0 \).

6. **General Strategy**: When faced with equations that resemble known forms but cannot be solved by standard methods, these substitutions provide alternative pathways to solutions.

The text sets the stage for detailed examples and explanations of each substitution in future discussions.
