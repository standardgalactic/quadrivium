The text outlines a section on solving differential equations using substitution methods when standard techniques such as integrating factors or separation of variables are not applicable. Here's a summary:

1. **Exact Equations**: The concept is briefly revisited where an exact equation satisfies \( \frac{\partial N}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial M}{\partial x} \).

2. **Linear and Separable Equations**: Previous techniques like solving linear equations of the form \( y' = f(x)y + g(x) \) and separating variables are mentioned as familiar methods.

3. **Introduction to Substitutions**: When these standard methods fail, three specific substitutions are introduced for handling more complex differential equations:
   - **First Substitution**: \( y = u(x)x \) or equivalently \( x = vy \), leading to transformed derivatives.
   - **Second Substitution**: Used for homogeneous differential equations where the function satisfies \( f(tx, ty) = t^k f(x, y) \). This substitution simplifies such equations.
   - **Third Substitution**: Applied to Bernoulli's equation of the form \( y' = p(x)y + q(x)y^n \), using \( u = y^{1-n} \).

4. **Homogeneous Differential Equations**: Defined by the property that both functions in the differential form scale similarly with a factor \( t^k \). These are not necessarily exact, requiring substitutions for solution.

5. **Bernoulli's Equation**: A specific type of nonlinear equation that can be transformed into a linear one using an appropriate substitution when \( n \neq 0 \).

6. **General Strategy**: When faced with equations that resemble known forms but cannot be solved by standard methods, these substitutions provide alternative pathways to solutions.

The text sets the stage for detailed examples and explanations of each substitution in future discussions.

The text introduces advanced methods for solving certain types of differential equations using substitution when traditional techniques fall short. Here's a summary:

1. **Exact Equations:** 
   - An exact equation in differential form is identified by the condition \( \frac{\partial n}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial m}{\partial x} \).
   - Linear and separable equations were previously discussed.

2. **Substitution Methods:**
   - Three substitution methods are introduced for equations not solvable by known techniques:
     1. Substituting \( y = u(x) \) or \( x = uv \) where derivatives transform the differential form.
     2. Handling homogeneous differential equations, defined as functions satisfying \( f(tx, ty) = t^\alpha f(x, y) \). These are not exact, necessitating substitution for solution.
     3. Bernoulliâ€™s equation: Involves substituting \( u = y^{1-n} \) to simplify the equation into a linear form.

3. **Homogeneous Functions and Equations:**
   - A homogeneous function scales as \( f(tx, ty) = t^\alpha f(x, y) \).
   - A first-order differential equation is homogeneous if both terms scale similarly with respect to \( t \).

4. **Application of Substitutions:**
   - For non-exact but similar-looking equations, substitutions help transform them into solvable forms.
   - Examples and detailed explanations for each substitution will be covered in subsequent discussions.

The text sets the stage for exploring examples using these substitution methods to solve differential equations that do not fit standard solution techniques.
