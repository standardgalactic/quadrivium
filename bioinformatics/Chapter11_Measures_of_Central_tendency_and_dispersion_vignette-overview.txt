The text transitions from discussing theoretical concepts to applying them practically, focusing on measures of central tendency and dispersion in statistics. Central tendency simplifies a dataset into a single value, such as the mean or median, providing an overview of where the data tends to center. Dispersion, on the other hand, describes how spread out the data is, with common measures including range, variance, and standard deviation. The text suggests performing calculations step-by-step to explore these concepts further through practical examples.
