In this video I will discuss the use of resection in Graves' disease.
Surgery is the least used treatment modality for Graves' disease and has a set list of
indications including patient choice, children and adolescents, pregnant women, very large
thyroid glands with compressive or cosmetic issues, the presence of ophthalmopathy, allergy
to thionomides and suspicion of thyroid malignancy.
Many of these indications are relative and must be discussed with the patient.
There are risks involved with surgery and apart from the usual problems of scarring, bleeding
and infection seen in most surgery, there is a serious risk of laryngeal nerve injury and
parathyroid injury seen in up to 10% of cases.
This is especially relevant today as most authorities prefer the use of total thyroidectomy.
Meticulous dissection around the laryngeal nerves and one gland parathyroid autotransplantation
minimizes these risks.
Hyperthyroidism is a necessity for safe anesthesia and most cases are prepared with thionomides,
beta blockers and inorganic iodide.
Surgery offers definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism, avoids radiation hazards and provides for accurate
histology.
With judicious use it remains a valid form of therapy for Graves disease.
