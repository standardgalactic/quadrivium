In this lecture from the "100 Lecture Series on Sympy," SymPy, or symbolic Python, is introduced as a robust computer algebra system integrated with Python to perform mathematical computations symbolically. The lecturer underscores SymPy's capabilities and its importance as a potent tool for conducting mathematics via programming. By leveraging SymPy, users can execute complex mathematical tasks efficiently within the Python environment.
