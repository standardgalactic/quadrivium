Okay, let's do this problem
also by using variation of parameters
now we can already see there's a leading 1
as a coefficient there
of the highest derivative of our
dependent variable there, so we don't
have to clean that up, so f of x we immediately
know is 1 over x. Remember we can rewrite this
as d squared minus 1y.
We're going to set that equal to 0 for the
genius equation, in other words m squared minus 1
equals 0, so m sub 1 equals 1
and m sub 2 equals negative 1
Don't make a silly mistake there, so y sub c
is going to equal c sub 1 e to the power x
and c sub 2 e minus e to the power
negative x. So y sub 1
is e to the power x, y sub 2 equals e to the power
negative x. If I write my
matrix of this, it's going to be e to the power
e to the power x. Let's clean that up
or just write e to the power x. The first derivative
of that is that, the first derivative of this
is that. For the Ronskian
I just need to get the determinant of this
so the Ronskian is going to be e to the power x
times negative e to the power negative x
minus those 2 e to the power x
and e to the power negative x
so the Ronskian is going to be minus what is e to the power x times e to the power negative x
and that's e to the power 0 which is 1 and the same happens there so that equals negative 2
so I have f of x I have y sub 1 y sub 2 and I have the Ronskian now I just have to remember
what to do to get y sub p now u sub 1 equals negative the integral of f sub 2 now f sub 2
is there so there's 1 over e to the power x 1 over e to the power x is my y sub 2 times the f of x
is 1 over x and my Ronskian is negative 2 so there's over negative 2 as well so that comes out as
positive a half now this is a non-elementary equation and the only way that I can write this
is a half integral going from x0 to x of 1 over t times e to the power t dt there's nothing but I
can't solve that in any other way u sub 2 is going to be the integral of y sub 1 which is e to the power
x times the f of x which is 1 over x and divided by the Ronskian which is a negative 2 so there's
negative a half that comes out dx and the same goes for this I really can't write this in any other
way but negative a half integral of x sub 0 x of e to the power t divided by t dt there's no other way
for me to write that so I'm going to be left with y equals c sub 1 e to the power x plus c sub 2 e to the
power negative x plus now this times y1 is e to the power x I'm going to be left with e to the power x over
2 times the definite integral going from x sub 0 to x of 1 so dt over t times e to the power t and
here I'm going to have negative 1 over 2 e to the power x integral going from x sub 0 to x I'm just
cleaning things up as I go e to the power t over t dt now there's no other way for me these are
non-elementary integrals I can't write them in any other way and I've just cleaned things up a bit
u sub 1 times y sub 1 and u sub 2 times y sub 2 and it is as close to a answer as I'm going to get
which looks a bit ugly but beautiful nonetheless I can solve this equation
