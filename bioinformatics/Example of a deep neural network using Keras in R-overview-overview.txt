To customize the appearance of plots in R, especially when working with libraries like `ggplot2`, you can use themes and functions that allow detailed customization. Below is a guide on how to style your plots for better visualization and presentation.

### Using `ggplot2` for Customized Plots

1. **Basic Plot Setup**:
   Start by creating a basic plot using `ggplot2`. Here's an example:

   ```r
   library(ggplot2)

   # Sample data
   df <- data.frame(
     x = rnorm(100),
     y = rnorm(100)
   )

   # Basic scatter plot
   p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
     geom_point()
   ```

2. **Customizing Themes**:
   Use `theme()` to customize various elements of your plot.

   ```r
   p + theme(
     panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue", colour = "black"),
     axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
     axis.text = element_text(color = "darkred"),
     legend.position = "top"
   )
   ```

3. **Advanced Customization**:
   For more detailed customization, you can modify specific components:

   ```r
   p + theme(
     plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgrey", color = NA),
     panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey80"),
     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
     axis.line = element_line(color = "black")
   )
   ```

4. **Using Predefined Themes**:
   `ggplot2` comes with several predefined themes that you can use:

   ```r
   p + theme_minimal()  # Minimalist theme
   p + theme_bw()       # Black & white theme
   p + theme_classic()  # Classic theme
   ```

5. **Customizing Legends**:
   Adjust the appearance of legends using `guides()` and `theme()`:

   ```r
   p + guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=5))) +
     theme(
       legend.title = element_text(face = "italic"),
       legend.text = element_text(size = 10)
     )
   ```

6. **Adding Annotations**:
   Use `annotate()` or `geom_text()` to add text annotations:

   ```r
   p + annotate("text", x = 1, y = 1, label = "Important Point", color = "red")
   ```

7. **Saving Plots**:
   Save your customized plots using `ggsave()`:

   ```r
   ggsave("custom_plot.png", plot = p, width = 8, height = 6)
   ```

### Example: Customizing a Neural Network Training Plot

If you are plotting training metrics such as loss and accuracy over epochs, you can customize it as follows:

```r
# Sample data for training and validation metrics
metrics <- data.frame(
  epoch = rep(1:10, each = 2),
  metric = rep(c("train_loss", "val_loss"), times = 10),
  value = c(runif(10, min = 0.5, max = 1), runif(10, min = 0.4, max = 0.9))
)

# Plot
p <- ggplot(metrics, aes(x = epoch, y = value, color = metric)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Training and Validation Loss Over Epochs",
       x = "Epoch", y = "Loss") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

# Display the plot
print(p)
```

This approach allows you to create visually appealing and informative plots that can be easily customized to fit your presentation needs. Adjust colors, themes, and annotations as required to highlight key insights from your data.

The text discusses challenges and techniques related to machine learning model evaluation, particularly within the healthcare context where real-world data complexities exist. It highlights that observed variables often serve as surrogates for underlying processes, complicating perfect predictions despite high accuracy levels like 96%.

Two primary methods are introduced for evaluating a classification model's performance: the confusion matrix and probability prediction.

1. **Confusion Matrix**: This tool organizes predictions into four categories—true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives—to visualize and analyze how well a model performs on test data. It helps identify correct predictions and errors in binary outcomes (0 or 1).

2. **Probability Prediction**: Instead of binary outcomes, this technique involves using the `predictproba` function to obtain probabilities for each class. By subtracting the probability of class 0 from 1, one can determine the probability of class 1, aiding in understanding high-confidence and close-call predictions.

The text also outlines a process for making binary predictions with neural networks in R, where a prediction is classified as 1 if its probability is 0.5 or higher. This demonstrates how neural networks handle probabilities for decision-making, using frameworks like Keras on top of TensorFlow.

Additionally, the text mentions broader aspects such as document preparation using HTML knitting in RStudio and publishing results with rpubs to combine visual elements with code for enhanced presentations. It also touches on web development topics related to CSS styling and scrolling features on a webpage.

Finally, the text describes neural network architecture, explaining components like input nodes, bias, tensor multiplication, and softmax output predictions, promising more detailed discussions in future sessions.
