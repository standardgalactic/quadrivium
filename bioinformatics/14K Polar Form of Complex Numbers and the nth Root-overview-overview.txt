The text explains how to work with complex numbers using their polar form, particularly focusing on operations like squaring and finding powers. It begins by discussing how a complex number \( z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \) can be squared or raised to any integer power \( n \). The result is given by:

\[ z^n = r^n (\cos n\theta + i\sin n\theta), \]

known as De Moivre's theorem. This theorem applies for all integers \( n \) except zero, assuming \( z \neq 0 \).

A special case arises when the modulus \( r = 1 \), simplifying the expression to:

\[ (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)^n = \cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta). \]

The text also covers vector rotation in complex space, illustrating that multiplying a complex number by \( i \) rotates it counterclockwise by 90 degrees. This concept is foundational for understanding the nth roots of numbers.

It explains how to find these roots using polar form representation and De Moivre's theorem:

\[ z = r (\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)), \]

and expresses a complex number raised to power \( n \):

\[ z = \omega^n = \rho^n (\cos(n\alpha) + i \sin(n\alpha)). \]

For these two expressions to be equal, their moduli and arguments must match:

1. Moduli equality: 
   \[ \rho^n = r \]
   Solving gives:
   \[ \rho = r^{1/n}. \]

2. Argument equality:
   \[ n\alpha = \theta + 2k\pi, \] 
   where \( k \) is an integer.

The nth roots of a complex number are calculated by:

\[ \omega_k = r^{1/n} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right), \]

for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \). Each root is equally spaced around a circle of radius \( r^{1/n} \).

Finally, the text highlights how this method can find both real and complex roots for any given number, emphasizing applications to negative numbers using complex theory.
