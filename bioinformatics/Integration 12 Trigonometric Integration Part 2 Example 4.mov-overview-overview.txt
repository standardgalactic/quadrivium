The text describes two methods for calculating the area bounded by a circle and other geometric shapes. 

### Method 1: Geometric Division
1. **Divide into Simpler Shapes:** The shape is broken down into simpler components like rectangles and triangles to make integration easier.
2. **Integration Setup:** Calculate the area using integral calculus with respect to \( y \), utilizing an equation derived from the circle.

### Method 2: Trigonometric Substitution
1. **Trigonometric Substitution:**
   - Apply trigonometric identities and substitutions to express the problem in terms of angles (\( \theta \)).
   - Use relationships such as \( \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) \).

2. **Integration Process:**
   - Perform integration with respect to \( \theta \), involving expressions like \( \frac{1}{2}\theta + \frac{1}{4}\sin(2\theta) \).
   - Convert back from trigonometric terms to original variables using unit circle relationships (\( \sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{a} \), \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{a} \)).

3. **Final Expression:**
   - Express the result in terms of the circle's radius \( a \) and \( y \).
   - Evaluate the integral from 0 to \( b \).

The text highlights that both methods provide flexibility in solving complex areas bounded by curves. It also discusses an expression involving:

\[
\frac{a^2}{2} \times \arcsin\left(\frac{y}{a}\right) + \frac{y \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2}
\]

Combined over the interval from 0 to \( b \):

\[
\frac{a^2 \arcsin\left(\frac{y}{a}\right) + y \sqrt{a^2 - y^2}}{2}
\]

The text questions whether this substitution and integration process is less efficient, suggesting concerns about its complexity.
