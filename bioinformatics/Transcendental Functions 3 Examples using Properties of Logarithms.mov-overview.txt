The text provides examples to illustrate properties of logarithms. The first example simplifies \(2 \log_{10}(x) + 4 \log_{10}(y) - \frac{1}{2} \log_{10}(z)\). Using the power rule, it transforms into \(\log_{10}(x^2) + \log_{10}(y^4) - \log_{10}(z^{1/2})\), which simplifies further to \(\log_{10}\left(\frac{x^2 y^4}{\sqrt{z}}\right)\).

The second example involves the expression \(\log_6(x) + \log_6(x-1) = 1\). By applying the product rule, it becomes \(\log_6(x(x-1)) = \log_6(6)\), leading to \(x^2 - x = 6\). Solving this quadratic equation, we find \(x = 3\) or \(x = -2\). However, since logarithms are defined only for positive arguments, \(x = -2\) is not valid. Thus, the solution is \(x = 3\).

Key takeaways include using properties like the power rule and product rule to simplify expressions, understanding that logs with the same base can be equated, and recognizing that the domain of logarithms requires arguments to be positive.
