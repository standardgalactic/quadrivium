The text provides an overview of three fundamental derivative rules used in biomathematics: the product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule. 

1. **Product Rule**: This is applied when two functions, \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), are multiplied to form a new function \( y = f(x) \cdot g(x) \). The derivative of this product is given by:
   \[
   y' = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)
   \]
   This means you take the derivative of the first function and multiply it by the second, then add the product of the first function and the derivative of the second.

2. **Quotient Rule**: Used when one function is divided by another, \( y = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \). The derivative is calculated as:
   \[
   y' = \frac{f'(x) \cdot g(x) - f(x) \cdot g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}
   \]
   This involves taking the derivative of the numerator and multiplying it by the denominator, subtracting the product of the original numerator and the derivative of the denominator, and dividing everything by the square of the denominator. It is crucial that \( g(x) \neq 0 \).

3. **Chain Rule**: Applied to composite functions, where one function is nested inside another, such as \( y = \sin(x^3) \). If \( u = x^3 \), then \( y = \sin(u) \). The derivative \( y' \) is found by differentiating the outer function (\(\sin\)) evaluated at the inner function and multiplying it by the derivative of the inner function:
   \[
   y' = \cos(x^3) \cdot 3x^2
   \]
   This involves taking the derivative of the outer function first, then multiplying by the derivative of the inner function.

These rules are crucial for differentiating composite functions, products, and quotients in biomathematics.
