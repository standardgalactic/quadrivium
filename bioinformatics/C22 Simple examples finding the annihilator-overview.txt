The text provides examples of annihilating differential operators for different types of functions. Here's a summary:

1. **Polynomial Example**: 
   - Consider the polynomial \(1 - 5x^2 + 8x^3\). 
   - The fourth derivative of this polynomial is zero, indicating that the annihilating operator is \(D^4\) (where \(D\) represents differentiation).

2. **Exponential Function Example**:
   - For the function \(e^{-3x}\), the differential operator \(D + 3\) (where \(D\) is differentiation) annihilates it.
   - This is because differentiating \(e^{-3x}\) gives \(-3e^{-3x}\), and adding \(3e^{-3x}\) results in zero.

3. **Exponential Polynomial Example**:
   - For the function \(4e^{2x} - 10xe^{2x}\):
     - The annihilating operator is \((D - 2)^2\).
     - This involves taking the second derivative and adjusting with terms to eliminate the original function, resulting in zero.

The text emphasizes understanding how these operators work by differentiating the functions until they become zero, and it notes that for exponential polynomials, the order of differentiation needed is determined by both the polynomial degree and the exponential factor.
