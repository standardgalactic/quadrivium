The text provides examples of annihilating differential operators for different types of functions. Here's a summary:

1. **Polynomial Example**: 
   - Consider the polynomial \(1 - 5x^2 + 8x^3\). 
   - The fourth derivative of this polynomial is zero, indicating that the annihilating operator is \(D^4\) (where \(D\) represents differentiation).

2. **Exponential Function Example**:
   - For the function \(e^{-3x}\), the differential operator \(D + 3\) (where \(D\) is differentiation) annihilates it.
   - This is because differentiating \(e^{-3x}\) gives \(-3e^{-3x}\), and adding \(3e^{-3x}\) results in zero.

3. **Exponential Polynomial Example**:
   - For the function \(4e^{2x} - 10xe^{2x}\):
     - The annihilating operator is \((D - 2)^2\).
     - This involves taking the second derivative and adjusting with terms to eliminate the original function, resulting in zero.

The text emphasizes understanding how these operators work by differentiating the functions until they become zero, and it notes that for exponential polynomials, the order of differentiation needed is determined by both the polynomial degree and the exponential factor.

The text provides an explanation of how to use annihilating differential operators for different types of functions. Here's a summary:

1. **Polynomial Example**:  
   - Consider the polynomial \(1 - 5x^2 + 8x^3\).
   - Its fourth derivative is zero, indicating that the differential operator \(d^4\) (the fourth derivative) annihilates it.
   - This is because the highest degree term (\(8x^3\)) requires four differentiations to reduce it to a constant (which then becomes zero).

2. **Exponential Example**:  
   - For the function \(e^{-3x}\), the operator \((d + 3)\) annihilates it.
   - The derivative of \(e^{-3x}\) is \(-3e^{-3x}\), so applying \(d\) gives \(-3e^{-3x}\).
   - Adding \(3e^{-3x}\) results in zero, confirming that the operator works.

3. **Exponential Polynomial Example**:  
   - For \(4e^{2x} - 10xe^{2x}\), the differential operator \((d^2 - 4d + 4)\) is used.
   - Here, \(\alpha = 2\) and the polynomial part is of degree 1.
   - The operator reflects the need to differentiate twice (due to the exponential term) and account for the linear term in \(x\).
   - The correct application of this operator results in zero.

The text emphasizes understanding how differential operators work with polynomials and exponentials, particularly noting the role of differentiation order related to polynomial degree.
