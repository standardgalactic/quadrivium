The text provides an overview of the long-term management and complications associated with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Here's a summary:

1. **Resource Intensity**: Spinal cord injury management is resource-intensive, requiring extensive multidisciplinary care due to numerous considerations.

2. **Thromboembolism Risks**: Patients are at high risk for thromboembolism due to factors like immobility and hypercoagulability from trauma. Preventive measures include heparin and compression stockings for three to six months post-injury, as most deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism cases occur within this timeframe.

3. **Autonomic Dysreflexia**: A dangerous condition often seen in chronic patients with injuries above the T6 or C7 level, where irritation below the injury site triggers severe autonomic responses like hypertension and tachycardia. Management involves removing the irritant source, such as emptying a blocked catheter.

4. **Acute Phase Management**: During the acute phase, managing blood pressure is crucial, possibly using medications or positioning patients upright.

5. **Urinary Complications**: Frequent urinary tract infections are common due to compromised bladder and bowel function, often leading to renal issues over time.

6. **Gastrointestinal Issues**: Patients face risks like aspiration pneumonia and stress ulcers during the acute phase. Implementing a bowel regime can prevent chronic constipation.

7. **Pressure Ulcers**: These require preventive measures like regular repositioning to avoid skin breakdown due to prolonged pressure.

8. **Psychological Concerns**: Depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies are prevalent among SCI patients, necessitating psychological support and early rehabilitation.

9. **Prevention of Secondary Injury**: The focus is on preventing secondary injury and complications while promoting early rehabilitation and addressing mental health issues.

The text also mentions the use of skeletal traction for spinal stabilization but clarifies it does not reverse the original injury. Proper sedation during such procedures can facilitate neurological assessment.
