This video series covers the management of patients presenting with thyroid nodules, which can be discovered through clinical examination or incidental imaging. The goal is to differentiate between cases requiring surgery and those suitable for follow-up. Various guidelines exist from North American, European, and British groups, but there's a lack of definitive level 1 evidence due to the slow growth of non-medullary, well-differentiated thyroid tumors.

The management algorithm begins with gathering patient history and conducting a clinical examination to assess risk factors such as age, sex, symptoms like dysphagia or voice changes, radiation exposure, family history, nodule size, consistency, fixation, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Initial testing includes thyroid function tests, with different paths for thyrotoxic versus hypothyroid patients.

For euthyroid patients without immediate risk factors, further evaluation involves ultrasound to assess nodule characteristics and guide decision-making. The algorithm provides pathways based on nodule size and type (cystic or solid):

1. **Nodules < 1 cm**: Safe follow-up in three months.
2. **Cystic nodules > 1 cm**: Require aspiration; if macrophages and colloid are present, re-evaluation is suggested. Complex cysts raise concerns of false negatives, prompting possible surgery.
3. **Solid nodules > 1 cm**: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is advised. If malignancy is suspected or follicular cells are present without definitive features, further discussion with the patient is necessary to decide on follow-up or surgical intervention.

Challenges include interpreting FNA results for follicular and hurthle cell lesions, which require careful explanation of risks to patients who must make informed decisions. In cases of inadequate FNA results, a second attempt is made before opting for surgery if repeated inadequacies occur. The series aims to provide a practical algorithm for clinicians managing thyroid nodules.
