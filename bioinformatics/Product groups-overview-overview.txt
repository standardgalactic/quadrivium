The text introduces the concept of a product group in abstract algebra, where two arbitrary groups \( H \) and \( K \) are combined using their Cartesian product. The elements of this product group are pairs consisting of one element from each group. A group operation is defined for these pairs as \(((H_1, K_1) \cdot (H_2, K_2)) = (H_1 \circ H_2, K_1 \circ K_2)\), where \(\circ\) denotes the respective operations in \( H \) and \( K \).

The product group satisfies all necessary group properties:

- **Closure**: The operation remains within the set of pairs due to closure in both \( H \) and \( K \).
- **Associativity**: This property is inherited from the associativity in each original group.
- **Identity Element**: The identity element is a pair consisting of the identities from \( H \) and \( K \).
- **Inverse Elements**: Each pair has an inverse, formed by taking the inverses of its components from \( H \) and \( K \).

Thus, combining two groups through their Cartesian product forms a new group structure that adheres to all group axioms.
