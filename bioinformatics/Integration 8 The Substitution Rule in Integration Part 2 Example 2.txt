Here's our next example. We asked to get the indefinite integral of the cosine of 2x plus 4 with respect to x.
What we did in the previous example was look for a, or even create then, a second function
who was the derivative of the variable in the first function.
Our first function here has a 2 of x and its derivative would be 2.
We would therefore consider to, to rewrite our problem in this fashion, 2x plus 4 and times 2 dx.
We needn't go through that step though. Let's look at a different way of solving this problem.
Let us use straightforward substitution. And what we're actually doing is the reverse of the chain rule.
Let's say let u equals 2x plus 4. Du dx is thus just a 2.
Now instead of getting du on its own, let's just get dx on its own.
So that would be dx equals a half times du.
Now let's substitute. That will be the indefinite integral of the cosine of u.
And instead of dx we're going to put a half du.
We can use the constant multiple rule and just bring out the half.
The indefinite integral of the cosine of u with respect to u.
Again, that would be easy for us to do by now.
The anti-derivative of the cosine of u would be the sine of u.
And it's indefinite, so plus c. If we substitute we'd get a half sine and u was 2x plus 4 plus c.
So we didn't go through the step of creating these extra two functions to be able to solve this problem.
