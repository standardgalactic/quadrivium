The text provides an overview of solving differential equations using substitution methods when standard techniques like integrating factors or separation of variables are not suitable. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Exact Equations**: These satisfy \( \frac{\partial N}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial M}{\partial x} \) and are briefly revisited.

2. **Linear and Separable Equations**: Standard methods such as solving linear equations of the form \( y' = f(x)y + g(x) \) and separating variables are mentioned.

3. **Introduction to Substitutions**: When standard methods fail, three specific substitutions are introduced:
   - **First Substitution**: Involves setting \( y = u(x)x \) or equivalently \( x = vy \), which transforms the derivatives.
   - **Second Substitution**: Used for homogeneous differential equations where the function satisfies \( f(tx, ty) = t^k f(x, y) \), simplifying these equations.
   - **Third Substitution**: Applied to Bernoulli's equation of the form \( y' = p(x)y + q(x)y^n \) using \( u = y^{1-n} \).

4. **Homogeneous Differential Equations**: These are defined by both functions in the differential form scaling similarly with a factor \( t^k \). They may not be exact, requiring substitutions for solutions.

5. **Bernoulli's Equation**: This nonlinear equation can be transformed into a linear one using substitution when \( n \neq 0 \).

6. **General Strategy**: These substitutions offer alternative pathways to solutions for equations that resemble known forms but cannot be solved by standard methods.

The text sets the stage for detailed examples and explanations of each substitution in future discussions.
