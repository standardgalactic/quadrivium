To solve the problem, you've set up a system involving coupled masses on springs described by differential equations. The Laplace transform is used to convert these into algebraic equations, which are easier to handle. Let's go through the solution step-by-step:

### System Setup

1. **Equations of Motion**: 
   - For mass \( m_1 \): 
     \[
     m_1 \frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = -kx_1 + k(x_2 - x_1)
     \]
   - For mass \( m_2 \):
     \[
     m_2 \frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} = -k(x_2 - x_1) 
     \]

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - \( x_1(0) = 0, \quad \dot{x}_1(0) = 1 \)
   - \( x_2(0) = 0, \quad \dot{x}_2(0) = 0 \)

### Laplace Transform

Taking the Laplace transform of both equations:

- For mass \( m_1 \):
  \[
  m_1 (s^2 X_1(s) - s x_1(0) - \dot{x}_1(0)) = -kX_1(s) + k(X_2(s) - X_1(s))
  \]
  Simplifying with initial conditions:
  \[
  m_1 (s^2 X_1(s) - 1) = -kX_1(s) + kX_2(s) - kX_1(s)
  \]
  \[
  m_1 s^2 X_1(s) - m_1 = -(k + k)X_1(s) + kX_2(s)
  \]
  \[
  (m_1 s^2 + 2k)X_1(s) - kX_2(s) = m_1
  \]

- For mass \( m_2 \):
  \[
  m_2 (s^2 X_2(s)) = -k(X_2(s) - X_1(s))
  \]
  \[
  m_2 s^2 X_2(s) = -kX_2(s) + kX_1(s)
  \]
  \[
  kX_1(s) - (m_2 s^2 + k)X_2(s) = 0
  \]

### Solving the System

You have two equations:

1. \((m_1 s^2 + 2k)X_1(s) - kX_2(s) = m_1\)
2. \(kX_1(s) - (m_2 s^2 + k)X_2(s) = 0\)

From equation 2, solve for \( X_2(s) \):

\[
X_2(s) = \frac{k}{m_2 s^2 + k} X_1(s)
\]

Substitute into equation 1:

\[
(m_1 s^2 + 2k)X_1(s) - k\left(\frac{k}{m_2 s^2 + k} X_1(s)\right) = m_1
\]

Simplify:

\[
(m_1 s^2 + 2k)X_1(s) - \frac{k^2}{m_2 s^2 + k} X_1(s) = m_1
\]

Factor out \( X_1(s) \):

\[
\left((m_1 s^2 + 2k) - \frac{k^2}{m_2 s^2 + k}\right)X_1(s) = m_1
\]

Combine terms:

\[
\frac{(m_1 s^2 + 2k)(m_2 s^2 + k) - k^2}{m_2 s^2 + k} X_1(s) = m_1
\]

Solve for \( X_1(s) \):

\[
X_1(s) = \frac{m_1 (m_2 s^2 + k)}{(m_1 s^2 + 2k)(m_2 s^2 + k) - k^2}
\]

Substitute back to find \( X_2(s) \):

\[
X_2(s) = \frac{k}{m_2 s^2 + k} \cdot \frac{m_1 (m_2 s^2 + k)}{(m_1 s^2 + 2k)(m_2 s^2 + k) - k^2}
\]

### Inverse Laplace Transform

Finally, apply the inverse Laplace transform to find \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \). This typically involves partial fraction decomposition and using standard Laplace transform pairs.

This process will give you the time-domain solutions for the positions of the masses.

To solve the problem involving two masses connected by a spring using Laplace transforms, let's break down the steps involved in setting up and solving the differential equations for this mechanical system. We'll assume you have some knowledge of physics, specifically mechanics involving springs and masses.

### System Setup

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( m_1 \) be the mass of the first object.
   - Let \( m_2 \) be the mass of the second object.
   - Let \( k \) be the spring constant.
   - Let \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \) represent the displacements from equilibrium for \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), respectively.

2. **Equations of Motion:**
   Using Newton's second law, we can write the equations of motion for both masses:
   
   - For mass \( m_1 \):
     \[
     m_1 \frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = -k(x_1 - x_2)
     \]
     
   - For mass \( m_2 \):
     \[
     m_2 \frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} = k(x_1 - x_2)
     \]

3. **Rewrite Equations:**
   Rearranging the equations:
   
   - Mass \( m_1 \):
     \[
     m_1 \frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} + kx_1 = kx_2
     \]
     
   - Mass \( m_2 \):
     \[
     m_2 \frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} - kx_2 = -kx_1
     \]

### Laplace Transform

To solve these differential equations using the Laplace transform, we will take the Laplace transform of each equation. Recall that the Laplace transform of a derivative is:
\[
\mathcal{L}\left\{\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2}\right\} = s^2 X(s) - sx(0) - \dot{x}(0)
\]

Assuming initial conditions \( x_1(0) = 0 \), \( \dot{x}_1(0) = 0 \), \( x_2(0) = 0 \), and \( \dot{x}_2(0) = 0 \):

- For mass \( m_1 \):
  \[
  m_1 (s^2 X_1(s)) + kX_1(s) = kX_2(s)
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  (m_1 s^2 + k)X_1(s) = kX_2(s)
  \]

- For mass \( m_2 \):
  \[
  m_2 (s^2 X_2(s)) - kX_2(s) = -kX_1(s)
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  (m_2 s^2 - k)X_2(s) = -kX_1(s)
  \]

### Solving the System

Now, we have a system of algebraic equations in terms of \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \):

1. \((m_1 s^2 + k)X_1(s) = kX_2(s)\)
2. \((m_2 s^2 - k)X_2(s) = -kX_1(s)\)

To solve for \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \):

- From equation 1:
  \[
  X_2(s) = \frac{m_1 s^2 + k}{k} X_1(s)
  \]

- Substitute into equation 2:
  \[
  (m_2 s^2 - k)\left(\frac{m_1 s^2 + k}{k}\right)X_1(s) = -kX_1(s)
  \]

- Simplify and solve for \( X_1(s) \):
  \[
  (m_2 s^2 - k)(m_1 s^2 + k)X_1(s) = -k^2 X_1(s)
  \]
  \[
  ((m_2 m_1)s^4 + (m_2 k + m_1 k)s^2 - k^2)X_1(s) = -k^2 X_1(s)
  \]

- Rearrange:
  \[
  (m_2 m_1 s^4 + (m_2 k + m_1 k)s^2)X_1(s) = 0
  \]

This equation can be solved for non-trivial solutions by setting the polynomial to zero and solving for \( s \). The roots will give you the system's natural frequencies.

### Inverse Laplace Transform

Finally, use partial fraction decomposition on \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \), then apply the inverse Laplace transform to find \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \).

This process will yield the time-domain solutions for the displacements of both masses. The specific form of these solutions depends on the roots found in the characteristic equation derived from the polynomial.
