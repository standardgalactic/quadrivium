This literature review from the Journal of the Society of Laparoscopic Surgeons (2013) by Stavros Antonio et al. examines a meta-analysis comparing laparoscopic versus open repair for perforated peptic ulcers. Historically, open repair has been the standard treatment; however, with the advent of laparoscopic techniques in the 1990s and medical advancements like H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), there's been a shift away from major surgeries for these ulcers.

The review aimed to determine if there is level 1 evidence supporting that laparoscopic repair is superior to open repair. The authors conducted a comprehensive search through databases such as MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register for Clinical Trials, focusing on prospective randomized trials. Only four studies met the criteria: three from China and one from the Netherlands.

These studies included 289 patients—151 undergoing laparoscopic repairs and 138 open repairs—with primary outcomes measured in terms of in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes including operative morbidity, surgery duration, post-operative pain, length of stay, and complications such as suture line leakage and respiratory failure. Despite these analyses, no significant differences were found between the two methods.

The quality of the studies was assessed using the Jadad (J-DAT) score; three had a fair score of 3, while one scored poorly at 2. The lack of statistical significance in outcomes suggests no evidence that laparoscopic repair is better than open repair. The review concludes that high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to justify the widespread use of laparoscopic repairs for perforated peptic ulcers.
