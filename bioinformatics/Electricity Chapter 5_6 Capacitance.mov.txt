Here we are back with the same problem. We are going to now look at the charge of a capacitor number 2.
Now, with C12 and C3 being in theory, Q remains a constant.
So V3 we got as 50V, but this is 100V. You can just do the math, but V12 is also going to be 50V.
That's easy to see, but we can do the whole thing. We can do Q equals CV, so V equals Q over C,
and V12 is going to be Q, which we knew, divided by C12, and that's also going to be 50V.
So we know that for V12, the equivalent of that, 50V over that.
And we know Q12 as well, that being 7.5 or 715, what will that be, microcoulomb.
Now let's look at Q2. Q1 and Q2 are in parallel. In other words, V is a constant.
So Q1 is going to equal C1V, which is constant, so that will be the one 2. And Q2 we might as well do, because I'm sure we're going to get to that part that's going to be C2V12.
parallel, so they'll have the same voltage. So Q1 is going to be, let's have a look, C1 was 10 microcoulomb times 50.
So we're going to get 5.00 times 10 to the power negative 4 coulomb. Let's do Q2, might as well do that.
C2 was 5 times 50, and that equals 2.5. 2.5 times 10 to the power negative 4 coulomb.
Now V was a constant, because those two are parallel, so we'll know V1 is going to be 50V. And we know V2 is also going to be 50V.
And if we just look at the electric potential energy for 2, it'll be Q2 squared divided by 2 times C2. And for, that's 1.
Let's do 1 on this side. 1, 1, 1. And we'll get U2 is going to be Q2 squared divided by 2 times C2.
I'm not going to do that with a calculator. That's easy to do. We know what Q1 is now. We know what Q2 is now.
And we know what Q2 is now. And we know what Q2 is now. And we know what Q2 is now. And we know what Q2 is now.
So just reminding ourselves to stay calm about what is in parallel, what is in theory. And then these become easy to do.
What is in theory?
Apologies on this section of video for the clothing and the phone. I am on call. And I get called to theater.
Let's just have a quick simple example. We're looking at energy density around a subatomic particle. Let's make that an electron.
What is the energy density? The distance, let's start with the distance of 1.00 times 10 to the power negative 6 meters.
So, 1 micrometer. Well, we know that the energy density is half E, H0, E squared. And we know that the electric field, and this is the important bit,
we know that that is Q over 4 pi, H0, R squared. So it's simple for us just to put that into our equation. So U is going to be,
so if we square this, we've got to square all of these. So that is still going to be 1 over 2. We have an epsilon 0. And E squared.
So this will be Q squared. This will be 16 pi squared. I hope in the previous videos I didn't make a mistake and kept this a 4. I can't remember.
Anyway, E0, R to the power 4. And those are going to cancel. And if we look at the energy density,
let me do that. So for an electron, negative 1.6 times 10 to the power negative 19 squared,
divided by 32 times pi squared, squared times 8.85 times 10 to the power negative 12 times,
now we've got the radius 1 times 10 to the power negative 6. Negative 6 to the power of 4. And that's going to give us about 9.16 times 10 to the power negative 6 joules per cubic meter.
What happens if we get closer and closer and closer to the electron? Let's let the radius tend to 0. If we just look at the equation here,
if r goes to 0, the limit as r goes to 0 of u, we're going to get that u tends to infinity. So it's actually a 1 over r to the power 4 problem. So that's what the fall off would be.
But in the denominator, if we let that to 0, we're going to get that u tends to infinity. So relatively simple problem.

That's right, sir.
