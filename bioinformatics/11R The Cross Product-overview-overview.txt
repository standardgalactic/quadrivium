The text explores several key concepts related to vectors in three-dimensional space:

1. **Scalar Triple Product and Volume**: The scalar triple product \( \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) \) gives the volume of a parallelepiped formed by three vectors. This can be calculated using the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix with these vectors as rows or columns.

2. **Condition for Coplanar Vectors**: If the scalar triple product (or its corresponding determinant) is zero, it indicates that the vectors are coplanar, meaning they lie in the same plane and form no volume.

3. **Coordinate System Independence of Cross Product**: The cross product of two vectors remains unchanged under transformation between coordinate systems, as long as both vectors are defined within the same system.

4. **Area of Parallelogram Using Cross Product**: The area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors is determined by calculating the norm (magnitude) of their cross product.

5. **Example Calculations**:
   - In one example, the area calculated from the cross product's norm is \( \sqrt{59} \).
   - Another example shows that if two vectors are collinear (one is a scalar multiple of the other), the parallelogram they form has zero area.

These concepts demonstrate how geometric properties such as volume and area can be derived using algebraic operations on vectors.
