The text outlines a logical proof demonstrating that \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \). This is achieved by showing each side of the equation is a subset of the other, thereby establishing their equality. 

1. **Definitions**: 
   - Intersection (\(\cap\)) includes elements common to both sets.
   - Union (\(\cup\)) contains all elements from either set.

2. **Proof Strategy**:
   - To prove equality, show two subset relationships:
     1. \( A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \)
     2. \( (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \subseteq A \cap (B \cup C) \)

3. **First Direction**:
   - Assume an element \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).
   - This means \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \), which implies \( X \in (A \cap B) \) or \( X \in (A \cap C) \). Thus, \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).

4. **Second Direction**:
   - Assume an element \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - This implies \( X \in A \cap B \) or \( X \in A \cap C \), meaning \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \). Therefore, \( X \in A \) and \( X \in (B \cup C) \), leading to \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Both subset relationships are proven, confirming the sets' equality: \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - The proof illustrates the distributive property of intersection over union in set theory by demonstrating mutual subset inclusion.
