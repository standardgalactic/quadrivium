To implement the Gram-Schmidt process for an orthonormal basis in Python, let's start with your existing setup. You have three column vectors which can be represented as columns of a matrix \( A \). The goal is to transform these into an orthonormal set using the Gram-Schmidt process.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initialize Vectors

Assuming you have three column vectors in a matrix \( A \):

```python
import numpy as np

# Example matrix with three column vectors
A = np.array([[1, 0, 2],
              [1, 1, 3],
              [1, 2, 4]])

# Extract the columns into individual vectors
a1 = A[:, 0]
a2 = A[:, 1]
a3 = A[:, 2]

# Initialize u1 as a1 (normalized later)
u1 = a1.copy()
```

### Step 2: Gram-Schmidt Process

#### Calculate \( \mathbf{u}_1 \)

Normalize the first vector:

```python
def normalize(vector):
    norm = np.linalg.norm(vector)
    return vector / norm

u1 = normalize(u1)
```

#### Calculate \( \mathbf{u}_2 \)

Project \( a_2 \) onto \( u_1 \), subtract this projection from \( a_2 \), and then normalize:

```python
# Projection of a2 onto u1
proj_u1_a2 = np.dot(a2, u1) / np.dot(u1, u1) * u1

# Subtract the projection from a2 to get orthogonal component
u2 = a2 - proj_u1_a2

# Normalize u2
u2 = normalize(u2)
```

#### Calculate \( \mathbf{u}_3 \)

Project \( a_3 \) onto both \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \), subtract these projections from \( a_3 \), and then normalize:

```python
# Projection of a3 onto u1
proj_u1_a3 = np.dot(a3, u1) / np.dot(u1, u1) * u1

# Projection of a3 onto u2
proj_u2_a3 = np.dot(a3, u2) / np.dot(u2, u2) * u2

# Subtract the projections from a3 to get orthogonal component
u3 = a3 - proj_u1_a3 - proj_u2_a3

# Normalize u3
u3 = normalize(u3)
```

### Step 3: Resulting Orthonormal Basis

The vectors \( \mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \) and \( \mathbf{u}_3 \) now form an orthonormal basis for the column space of \( A \).

```python
# Print orthonormal basis
print("Orthonormal basis:")
print(u1)
print(u2)
print(u3)
```

### Explanation

- **Normalization**: Ensures each vector has a unit length.
- **Projection**: Used to subtract components along existing basis vectors, ensuring orthogonality.

This process effectively transforms the original set of column vectors into an orthonormal set using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method.

The text explains the Gram-Schmidt process for orthogonalizing vectors, specifically within the context of QR factorization. The procedure involves taking a set of linearly independent vectors and converting them into an orthonormal set.

Here's a summary of the key steps described:

1. **Projection Calculation**: For each vector \( \mathbf{a}_n \) in the sequence, calculate its projection onto previously computed orthogonal vectors (\( \mathbf{u}_i \)).

2. **Orthogonal Vector Construction**: Subtract these projections from \( \mathbf{a}_n \) to obtain an orthogonal component \( \mathbf{u}_n \).

3. **Normalization**: Normalize \( \mathbf{u}_n \) by dividing it by its norm, resulting in a unit vector.

4. **Orthogonality and Normalization Verification**: The process ensures that the resulting vectors are mutually orthogonal and can be normalized to form an orthonormal set.

5. **QR Factorization Formulation**: In QR factorization, matrix \( Q \) consists of these orthonormal vectors, while matrix \( R \) is upper triangular with elements derived from dot products (or inner products in more general fields).

6. **Generalization Beyond Real Numbers**: The text notes that while the explanation focuses on real numbers, the process can be generalized to complex numbers and other fields by using inner products instead of simple dot products.

The overall message highlights how straightforward the Gram-Schmidt process is when implemented in Julia, a programming language suited for numerical computations. The author encourages further exploration through provided links and resources on their YouTube channel.
