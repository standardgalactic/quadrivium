This text provides an introduction to transcendental functions, defined as non-polynomial functions such as trigonometric functions (e.g., sine, cosine), logarithms (logarithm and natural log), and exponential functions (like \(a^x\) or Euler's number raised to a power). Key points discussed include:

1. **Basic Limits:**
   - The limit of \(\sin(t)\) as \(t\) approaches a constant is \(\sin(a)\).
   - The natural logarithm function, \(\ln(x)\), is defined only for positive values.
   - Arc functions like \(\arcsin(t)\) and \(\arccos(t)\) have domain restrictions between -1 and 1.

2. **Specific Limit Scenarios:**
   - For \(\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\arcsin(t)}{\sqrt{2}}\), the domain of \(\arcsin\) is considered.
   - The limit \(\lim_{t \to 0} t \cdot e^{-3t} + \frac{1}{2t^2 + t}\) is simplified by factoring, making substitution straightforward.

3. **Behavior at Infinity:**
   - Sine and cosine do not have limits as \(t\) approaches infinity due to their periodic nature.
   - Tangent tends towards positive or negative infinity near its vertical asymptotes.
   - \(\arctan(t)\) approaches \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) as \(t\) goes to infinity.

4. **Squeeze Theorem:**
   - Illustrated using graphs of \(t^2\), \(-t^2\), and \(\frac{1}{2}t^2\), the squeeze theorem helps determine limits by bounding functions.
   - If a function is squeezed between two others with equal limits at a point, it shares that limit.

5. **Key Limits:**
   - The limit of \( t^2 \sin(\frac{1}{t}) \) as \( t \to 0 \) is 0 using the squeeze theorem.
   - For piecewise functions, if left and right limits at a point are unequal (e.g., 4 and -3 at \( t = 0\)), the overall limit does not exist.
   - Memorable limits include \(\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\sin t}{t} = 1\) and \(\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{t}{\sin t} = 1\).
   - The limit of \(\frac{\sin^2 t}{t^2}\) as \( t \to 0 \) is 1, derived using the identity \(\left( \frac{\sin t}{t} \right)^2\).

The text emphasizes understanding these fundamental limits for transcendental functions, crucial in calculus.
