Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition often detected through routine biochemical screenings measuring calcium levels, identified biochemically in 80% of cases before clinical symptoms manifest. Many patients remain asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive issues until the disease progresses, historically associated with "bones, stones, abdominal moans, psychiatric groans."

Symptoms arise from elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone activity and include kidney stones, bone pain, digestive issues like anorexia and constipation, neuromuscular problems (weakness, fatigue), neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, cognitive dysfunction), and cardiovascular issues such as hypertension.

Bone disease can present as osteoporosis or rare osteitis fibrosa cystica, while nephrolithiasis is a common complaint due to hypercalciuria. Metabolic effects include glucose intolerance, increased BMI, and cardiovascular complications like left ventricular hypertrophy, with severe cases linked to higher mortality primarily from cardiovascular issues.

Diagnostic laboratory findings show elevated calcium levels with inappropriately high parathyroid hormone levels, along with mild renal impairment, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic acidosis, and normocytic anemia. A rare but severe complication is the parathyroid crisis, characterized by extreme hypercalcemia, central nervous system symptoms like confusion or coma, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potential pancreatitis.
