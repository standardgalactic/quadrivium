The text discusses expressing complex numbers in their polar form and finding their nth roots using this representation. A complex number \( z \) is represented as \( x + iy \), which can be rewritten using trigonometric functions as \( r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta) \), where \( r \) is the modulus (or magnitude) of \( z \), and \( \theta \) is the argument (angle with the positive real axis). The modulus \( r \) is calculated as \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).

For a given complex number, multiple arguments can be found by adding multiples of \( 2\pi \), but the principal argument (\( A \)) lies within the range \(-\pi < \theta \leq \pi\). 

The text then provides an example: to convert \( z = 1 + \sqrt{3}i \) into polar form, compute its modulus \( r = 2 \), and determine the principal argument by calculating \( \cos \theta = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{1}{2} \). This gives \( \theta = \pi/3 \), leading to the polar form of the complex number as:

\[ z = 2(\cos(\pi/3) + i\sin(\pi/3)) \]

Expanding this verifies that it returns to the original complex number, illustrating how to find and use the polar representation for further operations such as finding roots.

The text discusses how to express a complex number \( z = -1 - i \) in polar form. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

1. **Modulus Calculation**: The modulus \( r \) of the complex number is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts: 
   \[
   r = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{2}
   \]

2. **Components Identification**: It identifies the components \( x = -1 \) and \( y = -1 \).

3. **Cosine and Sine of Theta**:
   - The cosine of the angle \( \theta \) is given by \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
   - Similarly, the sine of the angle \( \theta \) is \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

4. **Quadrant Analysis**:
   - Since both cosine and sine are negative, the angle \( \theta \) must be in the third quadrant (angles between 180° and 270° or \( \pi \) to \( \frac{3\pi}{2} \) radians).
   - The text emphasizes that for angles in the third quadrant, both sine and cosine values are negative.

5. **Angle Constraint**: It mentions constraining \( \theta \) to be less than or equal to \(-\pi\) (or equivalently between \(\pi\) and \(2\pi\)).

6. **General Trigonometric Insight**:
   - Positive sine corresponds to positive y-values.
   - Positive cosine corresponds to positive x-values.
   - This helps in identifying the quadrant based on the signs of sine and cosine values.

The text essentially guides through converting a complex number from Cartesian to polar form while explaining how trigonometric functions relate to the coordinate system.

The text discusses how trigonometric functions relate to coordinates on a unit circle and emphasizes understanding angle measures in radians, particularly for angles like \( \pi/4 \) (45 degrees). It explains that the cosine function corresponds to the x-coordinate and the sine function to the y-coordinate. The focus is on finding angles where both sine and cosine values yield specific results.

For example, at \( \pi/4 \), both cosine and sine equal \( 1/\sqrt{2} \). However, when needing a negative value for cosine while maintaining a positive sine (or vice versa), different angle considerations are required. For instance, the angle \( 3\pi/4 \) yields a negative cosine but a positive sine.

The text then explores finding an angle where both sine and cosine are negative. This occurs at angles like \( -135^\circ \) or \( -3\pi/4 \), which is found by reflecting an appropriate angle across the x-axis. Here, both the cosine and sine of \( -3\pi/4 \) will be \( -1/\sqrt{2} \).

Finally, it ties these concepts to complex numbers in polar form. The example provided calculates the rectangular coordinates for a complex number with modulus \( r = \sqrt{2} \) at an angle of \( -3\pi/4 \), emphasizing understanding how angles relate to positive and negative values in trigonometric functions. This highlights the importance of knowing when sine and cosine are positive or negative based on the quadrant they are in, crucial for complex number calculations.

The text discusses trigonometric functions and their properties in relation to angles and quadrants. It explains that these functions can be either positive or negative depending on the quadrant.

Additionally, it addresses how to perform multiplication and division of complex numbers in polar form. For two complex numbers \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \), expressed as \( r_1(\cos \theta_1 + i \sin \theta_1) \) and \( r_2(\cos \theta_2 + i \sin \theta_2) \):

- **Multiplication**: The product is given by:
  \[
  z_1 \times z_2 = r_1r_2 [\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)]
  \]
  This uses the trigonometric identities for cosine and sine of sums.

- **Division**: The quotient is:
  \[
  z_1 / z_2 = \frac{r_1}{r_2} [\cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2) + i\sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2)]
  \]
  This requires that \( z_2 \neq 0 \).

The modulus of the quotient is:
\[
|z_1 / z_2| = \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}
\]

And the argument (angle) of the quotient is:
\[
\arg(z_1 / z_2) = \arg(z_1) - \arg(z_2)
\]

These equations are useful for solving problems involving complex numbers in polar form.

The text provides an explanation of how to represent and analyze complex numbers using their polar forms, particularly for finding roots.

1. **Polar Form Representation**: 
   - A complex number \( z = x + iy \) can be expressed in polar form as \( r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta) \), where:
     - \( r \) is the modulus (or magnitude) of \( z \), calculated as \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
     - \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \), representing the angle with the positive real axis.
   - The polar form highlights the relationship between a complex number's rectangular coordinates (\( x, y \)) and its trigonometric representation.

2. **Finding Roots**:
   - To find the nth root of a complex number, the polar form is useful because it simplifies multiplication and exponentiation operations on complex numbers.
   - The argument \( \theta \) is not unique; adding multiples of \( 2\pi \) to \( \theta \) yields additional valid arguments.

3. **Principal Argument**:
   - The principal argument (\( A \)) of a complex number is typically chosen in the range \( -\pi < \theta \leq \pi \).

4. **Example Conversion**:
   - For converting \( z = 1 + i\sqrt{3} \) to polar form:
     - Calculate the modulus: \( r = \sqrt{1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = 2 \).
     - Determine the principal argument using trigonometric identities, finding \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The polar form is a powerful way to represent complex numbers, facilitating operations like extracting roots and understanding their geometric properties on the complex plane.

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding both algebraic and trigonometric aspects when dealing with complex numbers in polar form.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of how to determine the modulus and angle (θ) for a complex number \( z = -1 - i \), represented in polar form.

1. **Modulus Calculation**: The modulus \( r \) is calculated as:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{2}
   \]

2. **Coordinates**: The real part \( x \) and imaginary part \( y \) are both \(-1\).

3. **Cosine of θ**:
   \[
   \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

4. **Sine of θ**:
   \[
   \sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

5. **Determining Quadrant**: Since both cosine and sine are negative, the angle \( \theta \) lies in the third quadrant.

6. **Constraints on θ**: The angle is constrained to be between \(\pi\) and \(2\pi\), specifically:
   \[
   \pi < \theta \leq 2\pi
   \]

7. **Conclusion**: In polar form, the complex number \( z = -1 - i \) has a modulus of \(\sqrt{2}\) and an angle in the third quadrant where both sine and cosine are negative.

The text discusses how to find an angle that satisfies specific conditions for sine and cosine functions, particularly in relation to coordinate axes. The main goal is to determine angles where the cosine (associated with x) and sine (associated with y) have certain signs.

1. **Initial Angle Consideration**: 
   - Start with \(\pi/4\) or 45 degrees, where both sine and cosine are positive, each equaling \(1/\sqrt{2}\).

2. **Negative Cosine Requirement**:
   - To achieve a negative cosine value while keeping the angle within certain quadrants, consider angles like \(\pi - \pi/4 = 3\pi/4\) (135 degrees), where cosine is negative and sine is positive.

3. **Both Sine and Cosine Negative**:
   - For both sine and cosine to be negative, reflect the angle across the x-axis, resulting in \(-3\pi/4\) or -135 degrees.
   - This angle ensures that both sine and cosine are negative: 
     - \(\cos(-3\pi/4) = -1/\sqrt{2}\)
     - \(\sin(-3\pi/4) = -1/\sqrt{2}\)

4. **Complex Representation**:
   - The expression \(z = r (\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta))\) is used, where \(r = \sqrt{2}\), and \(\theta = -3\pi/4\).
   - This results in a complex number with both real and imaginary parts being negative.

The text emphasizes understanding how angles relate to positive and negative values of sine and cosine in different quadrants.

The text explains how to multiply and divide complex numbers when they are in polar form. 

For multiplication:
- If \( z_1 = r_1 (\cos \theta_1 + i \sin \theta_1) \) and \( z_2 = r_2 (\cos \theta_2 + i \sin \theta_2) \), then the product is given by:
  \[
  z_1 \cdot z_2 = (r_1 \times r_2) [\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)]
  \]
This uses trigonometric identities to combine the angles and magnitudes.

For division:
- If \( z_2 \neq 0 \), then:
  \[
  \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \left( \frac{r_1}{r_2} \right) [\cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2) + i \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2)]
  \]
This results from dividing the magnitudes and subtracting the angles.

Additionally:
- The modulus of \( \frac{z_1}{z_2} \) is equal to \( \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|} \).
- The argument (angle) of \( \frac{z_1}{z_2} \) is the difference between the arguments of \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \).

These operations are essential for working with complex numbers in polar form, utilizing trigonometric identities to simplify calculations.
