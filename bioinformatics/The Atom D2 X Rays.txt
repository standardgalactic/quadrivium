Let's look at this question in two statements. In the same x-ray tube, can k-alpha, this peak, B, the wavelength there, be smaller than the cut-off wavelength?
And the answer is no, it cannot. Remember, we have the cut-off, and then we have the one peak, and then the other peak, and it's all the Brehm-Strahlum.
So, k-alpha is produced when an orbiting electron goes from n equals 1 to n equals 2, so it transitions from n equals 1 to n equals 2.
That's false, because I get this when it falls from n equals 2 to n equals 1.
For a given metal, is the wavelength here at the k-beta peak always smaller than the k-alpha peak?
Yes, the k-beta, the beta peak comes before the alpha peak always, and then there we have our cut-off.
So, indeed, that is correct.
I just want to clarify something quickly, and just remember that this alpha here is the one, is the peak at the wavelength where our orbit transitions,
our electron transitions from n equals 2 to n equals 1.
That will be the alpha peak.
Now, this is a very, very important problem.
It will help you understand the concepts of this x-ray machine.
I have an x-ray machine with a certain type of metal, and I want to identify this metal.
What I see is that the energy of the photon that gets released is 9,890 electron volt.
That is the energy of the photon.
I want to identify the energy of the metal.
What you cannot do is to equate this energy in the Bohr model of this.
Everyone sees the electron ball, z squared, but remember now we could have z minus 1 squared over n squared.
That you cannot do because you can't equate that energy to this energy, dynosalph or z because how did this photon get this energy?
That was because of the drop.
I kicked out, I think the problem asks for the k-alpha.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
I'm dropping from one orbit to another orbit of that.
First of all, I kick out this lower electron.
In this lower orbit, there's a gap.
The high electron falls into that gap, and that gives off.
So it's that difference between those two.
This equation gives me the energy of that electron in that orbit, not the difference between the two, not that drop.
It is that drop that gives me this photon's energy.
This gives me the amount of energy required to kick this one out.
So the electron that comes in has to have that energy to kick this electron out.
Now it falls, so the difference between those two gives me that energy.
So these two are not the same.
You cannot do that.
So let's remove it.
What you have to do is convert this to kilojoules,
to joules, which means 1.6 times 10 to the power of negative 19 joules,
divided by one electron volt.
That'll get rid of that.
That'll get rid of that.
So it's an SI unit.
It's an SI unit.
And what I do know, if I do work with these approximations using the Bohr model,
is that 1 over lambda is going to equal,
1 over lambda is going to equal R, the Ripper constant.
For our modification here, Z minus 1 squared,
and then 1 over N final squared minus 1 over N initial squared.
This is the drop from 1 to, from the initial dropping down to the final,
dropping from 2 to 1.
And that is why this is important, because, yes, the problem did ask for the K alpha B.
Okay, now I can solve for Z, but I don't know lambda.
But what I do know from this energy is that energy of my photon equals HC divided by lambda.
In other words, lambda equals HC divided by E.
So 1 over lambda would be E divided by HC.
And that's why I converted this to SI units, because I'm using SI units, SI units there.
And that is going to equal R, Z minus 1 squared.
And then what is this?
This is 1 over 1 minus 1 over 4, because I'm dropping from 2 to 1.
So 1 minus a quarter, so it's going to be 3 quarters.
So I can solve for Z, Z minus 1 squared,
is going to equal E over H, C, R, and 3 quarters.
So if I get the square root of that,
and if I add 1 on the other side, I am solving for Z.
But please note that this photon's energy is because of the drop.
So I've got to use this equation.
That is not the energy required to knock out that electron,
which means the energy of the incident electron.
That is that energy.
The energy of the photon that gets released
is because of the drop from a higher orbit to a lower orbit.
By the way, Z equals for me, check for yourself,
it's 32, that's terrain.
Now let's do this problem.
I have an X-ray tube, and this tube uses 35 kilovolts.
First I use molybdenum, then I use silver.
And I want to know what the cutoff wavelength is,
and then the wavelength of the k-alpha photons emitted by molybdenum and the silver.
Remember we said that this cutoff wavelength is independent of the metal that I use,
because lambda zero is just going to be Hc divided by E.
And as long as I use SI units for that E,
I get 35.5, 35.5 picometers.
Now, what will be the wavelengths of these photons emitted then first by molybdenum and then by silver?
Remember they are emitted,
so I'm going to have one electron falling from a higher orbit to a lower orbit,
two to one,
the L to the k shell,
in the case of k-alpha.
In other words,
I've got to use one over alpha equals the Ripper constant,
Z minus one squared,
and then one over the final squared minus one over the initial squared,
which is three quarters.
Then I can use 41 and 46 as far as that is concerned.
So for Z equals 42 for the molybdenum,
my answer is the molybdenum was 42.
42, I get 72.3.
Just check with your calculator that.
And for the silver, 47,
I get 47 to 57.4 picometers.
So this is dependent upon the spikes,
and the graph is dependent upon,
but the cutoff is independent of,
independent of,
because that's the minimum energy required
to knock that one electron out.
Now I've got more than that.
I'm going to get these different peaks for different metals
because I have this in my equation.
Now in this problem,
I'm operating an X-ray tube at 52 kilovolts,
and I want to know the Bremsstrahlung wavelength
corresponding to a 35%
of the kinetic energy with which the electron collides
with the metal target.
Now remember what I said is
that means I'm not using enough energy
to knock out that electron in the k equals 1 orbit.
All that energy
is just the kinetic energy with which,
the kinetic energy with which
that electron moves.
And all of that is just used to stop it.
It stops, so it has no more kinetic energy,
so that is then all put into the wavelength
of the emitted photon,
and it's not in one of those peaks.
In other words,
it is not the energy
due to the fall from the L to the K shell.
Okay, so I've got to work out,
this will give me the energy
in, will be 52.0 times 10 to the power 3 electron volts.
I have to multiply this by 1.6 times 10 to the power
negative 19,
and then I've got to multiply by 0.35
inasmuch as it's only at 35% of that kinetic energy.
35% of that kinetic energy.
And that wavelength again now
is just going to equal
hc divided by e.
Inasmuch as the cutoff was h0,
that was the minimum amount,
but remember,
I'm just dealing with the energy
because that electron stopped,
because it braked.
Brem.
Brem strahl.
Just because it braked.
Okay, so it's not the one,
the, the, the, the,
the ripple constant times Z minus 1.
We're not dealing with that.
We're dealing just in the breaking
of 35% of the kinetic energy.
What is 35% of the kinetic energy?
If I have to relate that to a wavelength,
and then I get a wavelength of,
now forgotten.
Let's have a look.
68.3 picometers.
Check in your calculator,
see if you get the same answer.
68.3, 6.83 times 10 to the power
negative 11 meters.
Let us do our final problem.
We have that the minimum energy
to knock a K-shell electron
out of its orbit,
its E minimum.
I also know that the K-alpha wavelength
of metal A is twice
that for metal B.
That's all I'm given.
What is the ratio of
the minimum energy
for metal A to metal B?
And once again,
as with all these x-ray problems,
we can approximate it
using the Bohr model.
And the energy,
as far as
this Bohr model is concerned,
the energy in that orbit,
the K-shell is
N equals 1.
It's going to be
negative 13.6,
13.6 electron volts,
Z squared over N squared,
and N squared equals 1,
K-shell,
so that's going to be it.
Now, these problems,
we put a Z minus 1
for all our approximations.
But if we're going to just get,
if we're just going to get ratios,
make life easy for yourself
and don't use the Z minus 1.
I'm not looking here
for a specific answer,
a specific approximated answer.
I'm just looking for a ratio.
Now, don't make life difficult
for yourself
because you want to cancel
things out in a ratio.
You know, a fraction
you want to cancel things out.
Don't do that.
In other words,
so if I take E minus 1 for A,
what am I going to have?
I'm going to have
negative 13.6 electron volts
and I'm going to have
Z for A squared
and I have E for B
this minimum.
In other words,
I'm going to have
negative 13.6 electron volts
and the Z for B squared.
These things are going to cancel,
so the ratio is going to be
the square,
the ratio of the squares
of the atom number.
Now, I don't have Z
but I was given the fact
that the K alpha wavelength
and what equation do I know
for that?
Well, that is going to be
1 over lambda
is going to be R
Z squared
and again,
I'm just looking for ratios.
I'm not going to use
the minus 1.
And I'm going to go from
for K alpha,
K alpha means I went
from 2 to 1.
It's going to be
1 minus a quarter
and that is 3 quarters.
and that is 3 quarters.
Now,
that will give me
a lambda of
4 over 3
R
Z squared.
what I actually want
is Z squared
so I should have solved
for Z squared.
Z squared is going to be
4 divided by 3R
lambda.
Bring the Z squared up
bring the lambda down
so it's 4 over 3R
lambda.
So what is
Z squared
so I'm going to be
well,
that's 4 over 3R
lambda of A
or let me do it
another way.
That's the reason why
I think why I did this before.
So if we get lambda A
let's do this one.
So lambda A
I'm going to have
4 over 3R
Z A squared
and for lambda B
I'm going to have
4 over
3R
Z squared for B.
Okay, I've solved for lambda.
But I know
that
lambda A equals twice B.
So if I want to equate
these to each other
I've got to say
this one
this one equals twice
this one.
So I'm going to have
if
or
no, let's do that.
So lambda A
so lambda A
equals twice
lambda B
twice lambda B.
So if I
want to
yeah, let's do that.
So
I'm looking for
Z A squared
and
over
Z B squared
so let's solve
both of these
for
Z A squared
is going to be
4 over
3
power lambda A
and Z B squared
it's going to be
4 over
3R
lambda B
but lambda B
I can
write lambda B
or let's write
lambda B
that means
I've just got to write
for lambda A
I can write
twice lambda B
twice
lambda B
and that makes it
very easy for me
because if I now do
Z A squared
over Z B squared
I'm going to have
4 over 3
3 times 2 is 6
I'm going to have
6
R
lambda
B
divided by
4 over 3
R
lambda B
4 and 4 will go
R and R will go
lambda B
lambda B
will go
and I'm going to be
left with
3 over 6
and that equals
a half
and that equals
a half
so the ratio
of these minimum
energies
is 1 to 2
if
K alpha
for metal A
is twice
that is for
metal B
