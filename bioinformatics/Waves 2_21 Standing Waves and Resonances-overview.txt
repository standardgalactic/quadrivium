The text discusses analyzing a standing wave described by the equation \(0.50 \text{ cm} \times \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3} x\right) \times \cos(40\pi t)\). This represents two waves traveling in opposite directions, resulting in the formation of a standing wave.

### Key Points:

1. **Standing Wave**: The equation describes a standing wave with nodes (points of no displacement) and antinodes (points of maximum displacement).

2. **Amplitude**:
   - The maximum amplitude of the standing wave is \(0.50 \text{ cm}\).
   - Each original traveling wave has an amplitude of half that, i.e., \(0.25 \text{ cm}\), because when they interfere constructively at antinodes, their amplitudes add up to form the maximum displacement.

3. **Wave Speed**:
   - The angular frequency (\(\omega\)) is given as \(40\pi \text{ s}^{-1}\).
   - The wave number (\(k\)) is \(\frac{\pi}{3} \text{ cm}^{-1}\).
   - Using the relationship for wave speed \(v = \frac{\omega}{k}\), the speed of the waves is calculated as:
     \[
     v = \frac{40\pi}{\pi/3} = 120 \text{ cm/s}
     \]
   - Converted to meters per second: \(1.2 \times 10^{-1} \text{ m/s}\).

4. **Distance Between Nodes**:
   - The distance between consecutive nodes is half the wavelength (\(\lambda\)).
   - Wavelength \(\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k} = \frac{2\pi}{\pi/3} = 6 \text{ cm}\).
   - Therefore, the distance between nodes is \(3 \text{ cm}\).

This analysis provides insights into the characteristics of the standing wave formed by two identical waves traveling in opposite directions.

The text discusses concepts related to wave physics and standing waves on a string. Here’s a summary of the main points:

1. **Wave Parameters:**
   - The relationship between k (wave number) and λ (wavelength) is given by \( \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k} \).
   - An example calculation shows that when \( k = \frac{\pi}{2} \), the wavelength \( \lambda = 4.0 \) meters.

2. **Standing Waves:**
   - In a standing wave, there is no transverse movement at certain points (nodes).
   - The derivative of displacement with respect to time (transverse velocity) at any node or antinode is zero because these points are stationary in the context of a standing wave.

3. **Specific Problem Example:**
   - A rope under tension oscillates in its second harmonic, meaning one full wavelength fits along its length.
   - Given \( k = \frac{\pi}{2} \), the wavelength \( \lambda = 4.0 \) meters, and thus the length of the rope is also 4.0 meters.

4. **Wave Speed Calculation:**
   - The wave speed on the string can be calculated using the formula \( v = \frac{\omega}{k} \).
   - With \( \omega = 12\pi \) and \( k = \frac{\pi}{2} \), the wave speed is found to be 24 meters per second.

The text illustrates how understanding wave properties and harmonics can help solve problems related to standing waves on strings.

The text discusses calculating the mass and period of oscillation for a rope exhibiting a third harmonic standing wave pattern. 

1. **Mass Calculation**:
   - The equation used is \( v^2 = \frac{\tau L}{m} \), where \( v \) is velocity, \( \tau \) is tension, \( L \) is length, and \( m \) is mass.
   - Rearranging gives \( m = \frac{\tau L}{v^2} \).
   - With given values, the calculated mass of the rope is 1.4 kilograms.

2. **Period Calculation**:
   - The period \( T \) is determined by \( T = \frac{1}{f} \), where \( f \) is frequency.
   - Frequency for harmonics is given as \( n \times v / (2L) \), with \( n \) being the harmonic number.
   - For the third harmonic (\( n = 3 \)), and given \( L = 4 \) meters and \( v = 24 \) m/s:
     \[
     T_3 = \frac{2L}{n \times v} = \frac{8}{72} = \frac{1}{9} \text{ seconds} \approx 0.11 \text{ seconds}
     \]

The text also mentions that for the second harmonic, the rope length equals the wavelength, and it notes the presence of angular frequency (\( \omega \)) and wave number (\( k \)).
