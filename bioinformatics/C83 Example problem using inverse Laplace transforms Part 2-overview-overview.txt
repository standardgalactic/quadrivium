The text outlines a mathematical procedure for solving differential equations using the Laplace transform. Specifically, it focuses on deriving an expression for \( X_1(S) \), which involves converting a complex fraction into partial fractions. This step is crucial to simplify the process of finding its inverse Laplace transform.

Initially, there are challenges in decomposing the equation due to the denominators' form. The speaker employs complex numbers to address these difficulties and solve for constants \( A \) and \( B \). With these constants determined, they reformulate \( X_1(S) \).

The subsequent step is taking the inverse Laplace transform to obtain \( x_1(t) \), which involves transforming terms into standard forms that correspond with known Laplace pairs, particularly involving sine functions. The speaker adjusts terms by multiplying them with constants for clarity and mathematical tidiness.

After verifying and correcting their calculations, they confirm the solution for \( x_1(t) \). The process is described as detailed and time-intensive, with a note of pausing to tackle another part of the problem, presumably finding \( x_2(t) \).
