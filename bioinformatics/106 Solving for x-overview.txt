To solve systems of equations using SymPy in Python, it's important to set up the equations such that everything is on one side (typically equals zero). This approach allows you to leverage SymPy's `solve` function effectively. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide based on your description:

### Solving a System of Equations

1. **Import SymPy and Define Symbols:**

   First, ensure you have imported SymPy and defined the necessary symbols.

   ```python
   from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

   x, y = symbols('x y')
   ```

2. **Define the Equations:**

   Make sure each equation is set to zero by moving all terms to one side.

   ```python
   eq1 = Eq(x + y - 1, 0)
   eq2 = Eq(x - y - 1, 0)
   ```

3. **Solve the System:**

   Use `solve` with a list of equations and symbols for which you want solutions.

   ```python
   solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
   print(solution)  # Output: {x: 1, y: 0}
   ```

### Solving a More Complex System

For more complex systems involving additional variables:

1. **Define Additional Symbols:**

   ```python
   z = symbols('z')
   ```

2. **Set Up the Equations:**

   Ensure all equations are set to zero.

   ```python
   eq3 = Eq(3*x + 2*y + z - 10, 0)
   eq4 = Eq(x + 2*y + 4*z - 12, 0)
   eq5 = Eq(2*x + 2*y + z - 8, 0)
   ```

3. **Solve the System:**

   Again, use `solve` with a list of equations and symbols.

   ```python
   solution_complex = solve((eq3, eq4, eq5), (x, y, z))
   print(solution_complex)  # Output: {x: 2, y: 1, z: 2}
   ```

### Key Points

- **Equations Format:** Always use `Eq(lhs, rhs)` where the right-hand side (`rhs`) is zero.
- **Solving Syntax:** Use a tuple of equations and a tuple of symbols in `solve`.
- **Complexity Handling:** SymPy can handle multiple variables and complex systems efficiently.

This approach not only simplifies solving algebraic problems but also ensures accuracy, making it ideal for both educational purposes and practical applications.
