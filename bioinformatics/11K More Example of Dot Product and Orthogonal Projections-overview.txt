The text discusses orthogonal projections and finding vector components in relation to other vectors. Here's a summary:

1. **Orthogonal Projections**:
   - The goal is to find the component of vector \( \mathbf{u} \) orthogonal to another vector \( \mathbf{a} \). This component is denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_2 \).
   - The equation for this projection is: 
     \[
     \mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{u} - \left( \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \right) \mathbf{a}
     \]
   - This involves subtracting the projection of \( \mathbf{u} \) onto \( \mathbf{a} \) from \( \mathbf{u} \).

2. **Example Calculation**:
   - Given \( \mathbf{u} = (1, 0, 0) \) and \( \mathbf{a} = (4, 3, 8) \), the dot product \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 4 \).
   - The norm squared of \( \mathbf{a} \) is \( 16 + 9 + 64 = 89 \).
   - Substituting these into the equation gives:
     \[
     \mathbf{w}_2 = (1, 0, 0) - \left( \frac{4}{89} \right) (4, 3, 8)
     \]
   - Simplifying results in \( \mathbf{w}_2 = \left(\frac{73}{89}, -\frac{12}{89}, -\frac{32}{89}\right) \).

3. **Orthogonality Check**:
   - To check if two vectors are orthogonal, compute their dot product. If it equals zero, they are orthogonal.
   - Example: For vectors \( \mathbf{V} = (-3, 4) \), find vectors orthogonal to it. Two such vectors are \( (-4, -3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).

The text emphasizes the importance of correctly applying vector operations, particularly when dealing with norms and dot products, to solve problems related to orthogonality and projections.
