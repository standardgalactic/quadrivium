The text discusses orthogonal projections and finding vector components in relation to other vectors. Here's a summary:

1. **Orthogonal Projections**:
   - The goal is to find the component of vector \( \mathbf{u} \) orthogonal to another vector \( \mathbf{a} \). This component is denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_2 \).
   - The equation for this projection is: 
     \[
     \mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{u} - \left( \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \right) \mathbf{a}
     \]
   - This involves subtracting the projection of \( \mathbf{u} \) onto \( \mathbf{a} \) from \( \mathbf{u} \).

2. **Example Calculation**:
   - Given \( \mathbf{u} = (1, 0, 0) \) and \( \mathbf{a} = (4, 3, 8) \), the dot product \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 4 \).
   - The norm squared of \( \mathbf{a} \) is \( 16 + 9 + 64 = 89 \).
   - Substituting these into the equation gives:
     \[
     \mathbf{w}_2 = (1, 0, 0) - \left( \frac{4}{89} \right) (4, 3, 8)
     \]
   - Simplifying results in \( \mathbf{w}_2 = \left(\frac{73}{89}, -\frac{12}{89}, -\frac{32}{89}\right) \).

3. **Orthogonality Check**:
   - To check if two vectors are orthogonal, compute their dot product. If it equals zero, they are orthogonal.
   - Example: For vectors \( \mathbf{V} = (-3, 4) \), find vectors orthogonal to it. Two such vectors are \( (-4, -3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).

The text emphasizes the importance of correctly applying vector operations, particularly when dealing with norms and dot products, to solve problems related to orthogonality and projections.

The text discusses orthogonal projections and calculations involving vectors. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Orthogonal Projection**: The goal is to find the vector component of \( \mathbf{u} \) that is orthogonal to another vector \( \mathbf{a} \). This involves using the formula: 
   \[
   \mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{u} - \left( \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \right) \mathbf{a}
   \]
   where \( \cdot \) denotes the dot product and \( \|\mathbf{a}\| \) is the norm of vector \( \mathbf{a} \).

2. **Example Calculation**: The text provides an example with specific vectors:
   - Vector \( \mathbf{u} = (1.1, 0, 0) \)
   - Vector \( \mathbf{a} = (4, 3, 8) \)

   The steps include calculating the dot product \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 4 \), finding the squared norm of \( \mathbf{a} \) as \( 77 \), and then using these to find \( \mathbf{w}_2 \).

3. **Orthogonality Check**: To check if two vectors are orthogonal, compute their dot product. If it equals zero, they are perpendicular.

4. **Finding Orthogonal Vectors**: Given a vector \( \mathbf{V} = (-3, 4) \), the text describes finding two vectors orthogonal to it:
   - One such vector is \( \mathbf{W}_1 = (-4, -3) \)
   - Another is \( \mathbf{W}_2 = (4, 3) \)

5. **Verification**: The orthogonality of these vectors is verified by calculating their dot products with \( \mathbf{V} \), confirming they equal zero.

The text also briefly mentions unrelated topics like linking to a website and a mention of "Putin," which seem out of context for the mathematical discussion.
