The text explains the concept of finding a potential function for gradient fields and why some vector fields do not possess one. Hereâ€™s a summary:

### Key Concepts

1. **Gradient Field**: A vector field \(\mathbf{F}\) is a gradient field if it can be expressed as the gradient \(\nabla f\) of a scalar function \(f(x, y, z)\).

2. **Potential Function**: The scalar function \(f\) associated with a gradient field \(\mathbf{F}\) is known as its potential function.

### Conditions for Existence

- A vector field must be conservative to have a potential function.
- In simply connected regions (without holes), a necessary condition is that the curl of the vector field \(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}\) must be zero.

### Examples

1. **Finding a Potential Function**:
   - For \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (y^3, 3xy^2 - 4)\), integrate and differentiate to find the potential function \(f(x, y) = xy^3 - 4y + C\).

2. **Vector Field Without a Potential Function**:
   - For \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (-y, x)\), compute the curl: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 2\). Since it's non-zero, no potential function exists.

### Higher Dimensions

- The principles extend to three dimensions where a vector field must be conservative (curl-free) for a potential function to exist.

### Conclusion

- A gradient field has a potential function if it is conservative.
- Verify by ensuring the curl of the vector field is zero in simply connected regions.
- Some fields, like \((-y, x)\), lack potential functions due to non-zero curl. Understanding these conditions aids in determining when and how potential functions can be identified for gradient fields.
