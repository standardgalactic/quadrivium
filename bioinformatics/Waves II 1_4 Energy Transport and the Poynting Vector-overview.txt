The text provides a detailed explanation of energy transport within electromagnetic waves, focusing on the equivalence between the energy densities of electric and magnetic fields.

1. **Energy Density Equivalence**: The key point is that in an electromagnetic wave, the energy density of the electric field equals that of the magnetic field. This concept simplifies calculations of average energy transfer, allowing us to consider only one component (usually the electric field) for analysis.

2. **Electric Field Energy Density**:
   - Starts with a capacitor and its stored potential energy.
   - The energy density \( u_e \) is derived using capacitance formulas and relationships involving area, distance between plates, and electric field strength.
   - Ultimately, the energy density of an electric field is expressed as \( \frac{E^2}{2\mu_0} \).

3. **Magnetic Field Energy Density**:
   - Uses the energy stored in a conductor carrying current to derive magnetic field energy density.
   - Relates this to the inductance per unit length near a solenoid's center, leading to an expression for energy density \( u_B = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0} \).

The derivation shows that both electric and magnetic fields have equivalent energy densities in electromagnetic waves, expressed as functions of their respective field strengths and the permeability of free space (\(\mu_0\)). This equivalence is crucial for understanding energy transport in electromagnetic theory.

The text discusses concepts related to electromagnetism, focusing on the relationship between electric and magnetic fields within a solenoid, as well as energy transfer in electromagnetic waves.

1. **Energy Density Equivalence**: The passage begins by showing that the energy density of an electric field is equal to that of a magnetic field. This is illustrated through algebraic manipulation involving current (I), number of turns per unit length (n), and the permeability of free space (\(\mu_0\)), arriving at expressions for the magnetic field in a solenoid and its associated energy density.

2. **Magnetic Field in a Solenoid**: The magnetic field within a solenoid is given by \(B = \mu_0 n I\) (where \(n\) is turns per unit length, \(I\) is current, and \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space). This can be linked to energy density expressions.

3. **Energy Transfer in Electromagnetic Waves**: The text introduces the concept of energy transfer per unit area by electromagnetic waves, represented by the Poynting vector (\(\mathbf{S}\)). It states that \(\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}\), where \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The direction of \(\mathbf{S}\) indicates the direction of wave propagation.

4. **Intensity of Electromagnetic Waves**: For sinusoidal waves with perpendicular \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\), the magnitude of the Poynting vector (and thus the intensity \(I\)) averages out to be proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude (\(E^2\)), divided by twice the product of the speed of light \(C\) and \(\mu_0\). The average value is derived considering sinusoidal variation.

5. **Root Mean Square (RMS) Values**: The text also discusses using RMS values for practical calculations, where the electric field's amplitude (\(E_m\)) relates to its RMS value by \(E_{rms} = \frac{E_m}{\sqrt{2}}\). This simplifies intensity calculations.

Overall, the passage demonstrates how energy densities of electric and magnetic fields are equivalent in specific contexts and illustrates calculating electromagnetic wave intensity using both peak and RMS values.
