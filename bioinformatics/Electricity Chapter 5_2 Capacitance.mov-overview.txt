The text describes the process of determining the capacitance for two types of capacitors: cylindrical and spherical. 

### Cylindrical Capacitor
1. **Structure**: Comprises two long thin cylinders with positive charge inside one cylinder and negative charge on the other.
2. **Gauss's Law Application**:
   - A Gaussian surface is drawn between the inner radius \(A\) and outer radius \(B\).
   - The electric field flux through the end caps is zero due to perpendicular orientation, so only the side walls contribute.
3. **Electric Field Calculation**: 
   - The electric field \(E\) at a distance \(R\) from the axis is given by \(E = \frac{Q}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 L R}\).
4. **Potential Difference**:
   - Calculated by integrating from radius \(A\) to \(B\), yielding \(\Delta V = \frac{Q}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 L} \ln \left(\frac{B}{A}\right)\).
5. **Capacitance Formula**:
   - Capacitance \(C\) is derived as \(C = \frac{2 \pi \epsilon_0 L}{\ln(B/A)}\).

### Spherical Capacitor
1. **Structure**: Consists of two hollow spheres with opposite charges.
2. **Gauss's Law Application**:
   - The electric field \(E\) for a spherical Gaussian surface is \(E = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}\).
3. **Potential Difference**:
   - Calculated by integrating from radius \(a\) to \(b\), resulting in \(\Delta V = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left(\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b}\right)\).
4. **Capacitance Formula**:
   - Capacitance \(C\) is derived as \(C = \frac{4 \pi \epsilon_0 ab}{b-a}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the inner and outer radii, respectively.

Both derivations rely on Gauss's Law to find the electric field and integrate it to determine the potential difference, ultimately leading to expressions for capacitance.

The text explains how to calculate the capacitance of two types of capacitors using Gauss's Law: cylindrical and spherical.

### Cylindrical Capacitor:
1. **Configuration**: Consists of two coaxial cylinders with radii \( A \) (inner) and \( B \) (outer), separated by a length \( L \).
2. **Electric Field**: Calculated using Gauss's Law, considering only the side walls since end caps contribute no flux.
3. **Flux Calculation**: The electric field \( E \) is constant through a Gaussian surface at radius \( R \) between \( A \) and \( B \). The expression for \( E \) is derived as:
   \[
   E = \frac{Q}{2\pi \varepsilon_0 L R}
   \]
4. **Potential Difference**: Calculated by integrating the electric field from \( A \) to \( B \), resulting in:
   \[
   V = -\int_A^B E \, dR = \frac{Q}{2\pi \varepsilon_0 L} \ln\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)
   \]
5. **Capacitance**: Given by \( C = \frac{Q}{V} \), leading to:
   \[
   C = \frac{2\pi \varepsilon_0 L}{\ln(B/A)}
   \]

### Spherical Capacitor:
1. **Configuration**: Consists of two concentric hollow spheres with radii \( A \) (inner) and \( B \) (outer).
2. **Electric Field**: Derived using Gauss's Law, considering the surface area of a sphere at radius \( r \):
   \[
   E = \frac{Q}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r^2}
   \]
3. **Potential Difference**: Calculated by integrating the electric field from \( A \) to \( B \), resulting in:
   \[
   V = -\int_A^B E \, dr = \frac{Q}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{1}{A} - \frac{1}{B}\right)
   \]
4. **Capacitance**: Given by \( C = \frac{Q}{V} \), leading to:
   \[
   C = \frac{4\pi \varepsilon_0 AB}{B-A}
   \]

In both cases, the capacitance depends on the geometry and dimensions of the capacitor.
