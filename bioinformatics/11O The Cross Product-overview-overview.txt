The text explains how to calculate the area of a parallelogram using vectors and determinants in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) spaces:

1. **Two-Dimensional Vectors**: 
   - For 2D, given vectors \( \mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2) \) and \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2) \), the area of the parallelogram formed by these vectors is found using the absolute value of their determinant:
     \[
     \text{Area} = |u_1v_2 - u_2v_1|
     \]

2. **Three-Dimensional Vectors**:
   - For 3D, with vectors \( \mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3) \) and \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3) \), the cross product \( \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)
     \]
   - The magnitude of this cross product vector represents the area:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \| \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \|
     \]

3. **Connection Between Vectors and Determinants**:
   - In 2D, determinants directly provide the area.
   - In 3D, the magnitude of the cross product (which involves determinants) gives the area.

4. **Special Case for Two-Dimensional Vectors in Three Dimensions**:
   - When extending 2D vectors to 3D by adding a zero as the third component, the cross product's z-component directly yields the area.

The text demonstrates how vector operations and determinants are used together to determine geometric properties such as areas.
