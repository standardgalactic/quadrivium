To find the area bounded by the x-axis and the function \( y = 6 - x - x^2 \), we need to determine where the function intersects the x-axis. This occurs when \( y = 0 \). Setting the equation equal to zero, we get:

\[ 6 - x - x^2 = 0 \]

Multiplying through by \(-1\), we rewrite it as:

\[ x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \]

Factoring this quadratic gives us:

\[ (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0 \]

Thus, the x-intercepts are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). These values form our interval for integration: from \( x = -3 \) to \( x = 2 \).

Next, we set up the definite integral:

\[ \int_{-3}^{2} (6 - x - x^2) \, dx \]

To integrate, we find the antiderivative of each term:

1. The antiderivative of \( 6 \) is \( 6x \).
2. The antiderivative of \( -x \) is \( -\frac{x^2}{2} \).
3. The antiderivative of \( -x^2 \) is \( -\frac{x^3}{3} \).

Combining these, the antiderivative is:

\[ 6x - \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3} \]

We evaluate this from \(-3\) to \(2\):

1. At \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   6(2) - \frac{2^2}{2} - \frac{2^3}{3} = 12 - 2 - \frac{8}{3}
   \]

2. At \( x = -3 \):
   \[
   6(-3) - \frac{(-3)^2}{2} - \frac{(-3)^3}{3} = -18 - \frac{9}{2} + \frac{27}{3}
   \]

Subtract the value at \( x = -3 \) from the value at \( x = 2 \):

\[
\left(12 - 2 - \frac{8}{3}\right) - \left(-18 - \frac{9}{2} + 9\right)
\]

Simplifying:

- At \( x = 2 \): 
  \[
  10 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{22}{3}
  \]

- At \( x = -3 \):
  \[
  -18 - \frac{9}{2} + 9 = -9 - \frac{9}{2} = -\frac{18}{2} - \frac{9}{2} = -\frac{27}{2}
  \]

Convert \(-\frac{27}{2}\) to a denominator of 6:

\[
-\frac{27}{2} = -\frac{81}{6}
\]

Convert \(\frac{22}{3}\) to a denominator of 6:

\[
\frac{22}{3} = \frac{44}{6}
\]

Now calculate the difference:

\[
\frac{44}{6} + \frac{81}{6} = \frac{125}{6}
\]

Thus, the area bounded by the x-axis and the function is \(\frac{125}{6}\).
