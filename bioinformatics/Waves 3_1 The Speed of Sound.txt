Now that we've looked at some introductory aspects of longitudinal waves, let's look at it in more detail.
And what these videos tend to be about is those introductory notes are more college-based physics or algebra-based physics,
and we're now going to get to more calculus-based physics.
So we are still talking about mechanical waves.
And a mechanical wave means it is a wave that passes through a medium.
We looked at transverse waves, where the motion of any element in that medium moves in a direction perpendicular to the propagation direction of the wave.
And now we're going to look at longitudinal waves, of which the most important one that we're going to look at is sound waves.
And that means that the displacement of an element in that medium is in the direction and opposite in direction to the direction of propagation of that wave.
So if we look at a point source of sound in three-dimensional space, we'll see these spherical surfaces move out, move out from the center.
And we denote those by circular, by these circular lines, which are the wave fronts.
And along that three-dimensional spherical surface, the oscillation is of the same magnitude and in the same direction.
The direction of the traveling is given by these directional vectors, which are called rays, and as you'll see here, any element in the medium surrounding the source,
there is this back and forth, there is this back and forward motion in the direction and against the direction of a ray that will pass through the direction of the traveling of the wave.
So let's start by looking at the speed of a longitudinal wave in a medium as a mechanical wave.
And we know from transverse wave that the velocity equals the tension divided by the linear density.
And what we are actually saying with this equation is that we're looking at some elastic property, the tension.
I'm pulling that string.
So that's a measure of potential energy divided by the inertial property for it to not to want to move
or to move back to its original position.
So this is more of a type of kinetic property we're looking at.
So it is the square root of the fraction of an elastic versus an inertial property.
We also looked at this equation where we said that the speed of an armature wave equals the square root of the modulus.
If it was a solid, if it was a solid, we talked about such a metal, we talked about Young's modulus.
If it was a fluid, we talked about the bulk of the modulus divided by the density.
In some textbooks, just to note, this modulus by B.
So that's this B divided by rho and the square root of that which gives us the velocity.
But what is this modulus?
And here we have an equation for the modulus.
And it is, what this equation boils down to is that there's a change in pressure divided by the fraction of the change in volume.
And the reason why we put the negative here is if we increase the pressure that will be positive,
divided by the volume is always positive.
And the change in volume, if I increase the pressure, the change in volume is going to be a negative.
So we just want the negative there to make the modulus B positive.
So we put the negative there.
But the fractional change in volume, so that's change in volume divided by original volume.
So as that changes proportional to this change in pressure.
So it's pressure per change in volume.
And if we just look at the units here, volume and volume, so cubic meter, cubic meter will cancel the units.
So we're left with change in pressure and that is the pascal as far as modulus.
So it has the same unit as pressure.
It has the same unit as pressure.
So it's more of an engineering term, an understanding of what's happening here.
And what it then boils to is we can use that and the density of the medium, the square root of that,
to give us the speed of a wave, a longitudinal wave, through a medium.
Let's give a practical example of why, of what this means.
The bulk modulus is minus the change in pressure divided by the fraction of the change in volume divided by volume.
And here's a very good practical explanation.
If we look at the velocity of sound through air at zero degrees Celsius,
we see that it's 331 meters per second.
Now we're going to look at it through water.
And the velocity equals the square root of the modulus divided by density.
Now the density of water is almost a thousand times more than air.
So the denominator gets almost a thousand times higher.
That means this fraction is a lot smaller,
which means the velocity of sound through water should be a lot smaller,
which is not.
It is a thousand four hundred and two meters per second at zero degrees Celsius.
And why is that?
Because water is a lot less compressible than air.
So the amount of pressure I have to,
the amount of pressure I have to generate
just for a very small fraction in here,
a change in volume is enormous for a very small change there,
which means the bulk modulus is a hell of a lot larger for
fluid, water, than it would be for air.
In other words, B increases substantially more
than a thousand, almost a thousand for density,
and that means the velocity is going to be so much higher.
And that is what this equation refers to.
A lot more pressure for that fractional change in,
very tiny fractional change in volume if you try to compress water.
This is air, not a lot of pressure required for a big change in volume.
Let's look at a very simple example of a modulus.
We want to know what the modulus is of this mass of gas,
0.032, so 32 grams of mass of a, say, of oxygen,
volume if the volume is 22.4 liters and the velocity is 314 meters per second.
And we'll have to use our equation for velocity,
obviously, with the modulus in,
so that is going to be the bulk modulus divided by density.
So velocity squared is going to be B over rho,
and B is going to equal velocity squared times rho.
We don't know what rho is,
but we do know an equation for rho
inasmuch as it's mass divided by volume.
So we could have the bulk modulus going to be
velocity squared times mass,
times mass divided by volume.
Just the volume is here in liters,
and liters is not an SI unit or base SI unit.
So if we want to convert 22.4 liters,
we've got to multiply that.
What would be the conversion factor B?
How many square meters, cubic meters, is in a liter?
Well, one liter is 10 centimeters by 10 centimeters by 10 centimeters.
10 centimeters is 0.1 meters,
so that would be 0.1 cubed, meter cubed,
into one liter.
So if we multiply that out,
I think that comes to about,
I think it was 0.0224 cubic meters.
And if we put that for volume in here,
we're going to get to about 1.44 times 10 to the power of 5 bascals
for our modulus.
For our modulus.
So a simple problem.
Let's just look at one of those fundamental problems
that are actually so interesting.
We're going to take a stone,
we drop it down a well,
and we hear the splash three seconds later.
The velocity we're going to take is 343 meters per second,
as far as the speed of sound through air is concerned,
and the time it takes to the sound for us to hear the sound is three seconds.
Think about what's happening here.
There are two things happening here.
First of all,
the stone has got to drop,
and that'll take some time.
It's called that time t down.
And it's going to go up again,
and that'll take some time t up.
And all we know is that t up plus t down equals 3.00 seconds.
What we do know is that the displacement
for the stone to drop down
will be y,
and that's the same length
as the sound wave has to travel
in time t up.
Now we've got to remember two equations
from classical mechanics.
Two equations that are going to help us.
I'm going to write them here.
Let's call this one.
We're going to have S equals S0
plus V0t plus a half At squared.
From classical mechanics.
And we're going to remember
V equals distance divided by time.
Okay, let's take this first one.
We've got to travel the distance y.
If we start at 0,
don't worry that this is up and down.
We're not, you know,
it's not a problem that we need
to consider, you know,
to consider that sort of thing.
Just imagine we start at the 0 velocity.
At 0 distance,
we're going to accelerate
over a certain distance
in a certain time.
That's all we're concerned about.
So our starting distance is 0.
Our starting velocity is 0.
So we're just left with a half.
And what is the acceleration going to be?
Well, that's the gravitational acceleration
times t down squared.
Let's make that 2.
From velocity equals distance
divided by time,
we're going to get the distance
we're going to travel
equals velocity times time up.
Let's make that equation 3.
Okay, so irrespective of the fact
that the one distance is down
and the one is up,
I mean, they are exactly
the same distance.
And to travel that distance
it's going to take us
a half g t down squared.
It's going to take
as that is the distance.
And the distance for up
is going to be
v equals time up.
So these two wires
are exactly the same.
The magnitude of this displacement
is exactly the same.
So what we can say
is that a half g t squared
t down squared
equals velocity
of sound through air
times t up.
Now, these two are two unknowns
but we do have an equation here
for t up plus t down
has got to be 3 seconds.
So we can say
that a half g t down squared
is going to be
v times 3 minus t down.
Let's multiply both sides out
by 2.
So we're going to get
g t down squared
is going to equal
2 times v times 3
that's 6v
minus 2 times v times td.
Let's get them all
on the same side.
So we're going to have
g t down squared
plus 2v
td
minus 6v
equals 0.
Now we have a polynomial
of second degree
of td squared
td
and then td
to the power 0.
So
let's make some space.
We can use
for our unknown
as td
equals minus
b plus minus
the square root
of b squared
minus 4ac
divided by 2a
to solve for
our second order
quadratic equation.
So let's see
what t down
is going to be.
Our t down
is going to be
minus
b
and b is
2 times v
2 times v
plus minus
the square root
of
b squared
so that's going
to be
4v squared
minus
4 times
a times c
minus
4 times
g
times
negative 6
negative times
negative is
positive
so we're going to
have
minus
positive
the 4
a is g
and remember
this is just a
placeholder
that's not
acceleration
it's just a
placeholder
and c is
negative 6v
so that'll be
6v
that negative
times that negative
gives us this
positive
divided by
2 times a
is g
and
obviously
this is going
to be
negative
686
this is going
to be
positive
so for
time
we've got to
use the
positive here
not the
negative
and if you
put all of
those in
you're going
to know
that t is
going to be
about
2.88
seconds
1 over
seconds
and all
we have to
do now
is remember
we said
y
equals
half
g
t squared
now
this was
t down
we do
have a value
for t
down
now
2.88
seconds
so y
is going
to be
a half
times g
which is
9.8
meters per
second
squared
times
2.88
seconds
squared
squared
seconds
squared
and do
that
I think
you get
to an
answer
of
what was
my answer
it
was
40.7
meters
40.7
meters
so that's
such a
that is
such a
lovely
problem
you've got
to break
it down
into the
up and
the down
times
you've got
two equations
you've got
two equations
with two
unknowns
and we actually
have a third
equation
where we can
express
td
in terms
of tu
we can
replace it
in there
and we
solve for
the problem
very
very easy
in the end
although
it takes
quite a
while
and quite
a bit
of thinking
doesn't
it
to get
to
40.7
meters
and that's
so
interesting
everyone
has done
it
probably
as a
child
dropped
it
down
and
now
you
know
eventually
we have
to work
out
how deep
that
well
is
