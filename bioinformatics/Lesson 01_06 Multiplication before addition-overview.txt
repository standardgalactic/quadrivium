The text explains the concept of the associative law in mathematical expressions, emphasizing how it allows for changing the grouping of operations without altering the result. In computer languages like Julia, understanding this is crucial as it determines the order in which parts of an expression are executed. The text illustrates this with a basic example: \(2 - 4 \times 3\). By default, multiplication is performed before subtraction, yielding \(2 - 12 = -10\). However, by using parentheses to change the grouping, such as \((2 - 4) \times 3\), the order of operations can be altered to first compute \(2 - 4\) (resulting in \(-2\)), and then multiply by 3, giving \(-6\). This demonstrates how parentheses can control operation execution, akin to traditional pen-and-paper mathematics.

The text discusses the associative law in arithmetic expressions, emphasizing how certain parts of an expression can be grouped using parentheses to alter the order of operations. This concept is applicable in programming languages like Julia. In arithmetic, standard rules dictate that multiplication precedes subtraction unless parentheses are used to change this order. For example, in the expression \(2 - 4 \times 3\), multiplication is performed first, resulting in \(2 - 12 = -10\). However, by using parentheses, such as \((2 - 4) \times 3\), subtraction occurs before multiplication, yielding \(-2 \times 3 = -6\). This demonstrates how parentheses can control the sequence of operations to achieve desired results.
