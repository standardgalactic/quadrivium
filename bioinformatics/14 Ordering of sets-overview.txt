The text discusses how order can be imposed on sets using binary relations. It highlights that while humans naturally impose an order on numbers or alphabets, in set theory, ordering must be explicitly defined.

1. **Ordering of Natural Numbers:**
   - The natural numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3) inherently have a natural order with the "less than or equal to" relation (≤). This creates a total ordering where each number can be directly compared and ranked in sequence.

2. **Partial Ordering Example Using Division:**
   - When using a different binary relation like division on a set \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 12\} \), the natural order is disrupted. While some numbers divide others (e.g., 1 divides all elements; 2 divides 4 and 12), not all pairs have a comparable relationship under division (e.g., 2 does not divide 3). This results in partial ordering rather than total ordering.

3. **Partial vs. Total Ordering:**
   - A total order is one where every pair of elements is comparable, like the natural numbers with ≤.
   - A partial order allows for some pairs to be incomparable, as seen with the division relation on set \( A \).

4. **First and Last Elements in Partial Orders:**
   - In a partially ordered set, you may have:
     - A *first element* (minimal element): An element that divides all others (e.g., 1 in this context).
     - A *last element* (maximal element): An element that is divided by all others (e.g., 12 here).

5. **Minimal and Maximal Elements:**
   - These are elements where no other element in the set can be found that divides a minimal element, or is divided by a maximal element, respectively.
   - Minimal and maximal elements may not be unique unless further conditions define them as first or last.

The text concludes with examples and terms related to these ordering concepts, emphasizing how different relations yield different types of orderings within sets.

The text discusses concepts related to partial and complete orderings in sets. It explains a scenario with elements A, B, C, D, and E:

- **Partial Ordering**: Elements A, B partially order into C, which then orders into both D and E. Both C and D can reach E.
  - This setup shows multiple maximal elements (C and D) because more than one element has no successors in the context of ordering to E.
  - There is a single minimal element at the start of the sequence.

- **Complete Ordering**: A different scenario with a single maximal element and two minimal elements, illustrating that orderings can vary between partial and complete.

Key terms introduced include:
- **Minimal Elements**: Elements with no predecessors in the set.
- **Maximal Elements**: Elements with no successors in the set.
- **First and Last Element**: Concepts related to singular starting or ending points within an ordering.

The text suggests these are intuitive concepts when analyzing ordered sets. Additional unrelated phrases about licensing, limits, and family information appear at the end, likely extraneous to the main discussion on orderings.
