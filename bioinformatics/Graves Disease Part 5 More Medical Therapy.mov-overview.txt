The text discusses various medical treatments for Graves' disease, focusing on lithium, cholestyramine, and rituximab. Lithium affects hormone synthesis and release, used in specific scenarios like discontinuation of thionamides or during amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. The usual dose is 300 mg per day with careful monitoring to avoid toxicity. Cholestyramine works by binding thyroid hormones in the gut, disrupting their enterohepatic circulation and proving effective in managing thyrotoxicosis. Rituximab, an immunomodulatory drug targeting CD20 on pre-B cells, is being explored for its potential in treating Graves' disease through immune system modulation. Other experimental drugs are also under investigation. While these treatments show promise, their efficacy and safety remain unproven, awaiting further validation. Future discussions may explore the outcomes of these therapies more thoroughly. The next video will cover radioactive iodine therapy as a treatment option for Graves' disease.
