The text discusses the phenomenon of beats in longitudinal waves. Beats occur when two sounds with slightly different frequencies are heard together; they result from the interference between these frequencies. The beat frequency, which is perceived as a rhythmic pulsing or change in sound intensity, equals the absolute difference between the two frequencies.

For example, if one sound has a frequency of 700 hertz and another has 680 hertz, you would hear an average frequency of about 690 hertz. However, the beat itself would occur at 20 hertz, as this is the difference between the two original frequencies. This results in a periodic change in intensity that you perceive as beats, occurring 20 times per second. While individual sounds are close enough to be difficult to distinguish separately, their interaction creates noticeable fluctuations in sound intensity known as beats.
