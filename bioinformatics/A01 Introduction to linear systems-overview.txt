This text introduces an advanced series on differential equations focusing on solving linear systems using matrix equations. The goal is to demonstrate how a system of differential equations can be expressed and solved as a matrix problem.

The example given involves two differential equations:

1. \( y' + 7y - 4x = 0 \)
2. \( x' - 3x + 4y = 0 \)

Here, both \( x \) and \( y \) are functions of \( t \). The solutions to these equations are expressed as:

- \( x(t) = e^{-5t} \)
- \( y(t) = 2e^{-5t} \)

These solutions indicate a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \), specifically \( y = 2x \).

The text explains that this system can be represented using matrices. By defining a matrix \( X \) with components \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), the derivative of this matrix, \( X' \), can be expressed as:

\[ X' = AX \]

where \( A \) is a coefficient matrix derived from the original system of equations:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -4 \\ 4 & -7 \end{bmatrix} \]

The product \( AX \) results in expressions for \( x' \) and \( y' \), aligning with the derivatives found from the solutions.

The text distinguishes between homogeneous systems (where an additional function \( f(t) = 0 \)) and non-homogeneous systems (where \( f(t) \neq 0 \)). The aim is to solve for a set of functions that satisfy these matrix equations, exploring linear dependency concepts in future discussions.
