This text introduces an advanced series on differential equations focusing on solving linear systems using matrix equations. The goal is to demonstrate how a system of differential equations can be expressed and solved as a matrix problem.

The example given involves two differential equations:

1. \( y' + 7y - 4x = 0 \)
2. \( x' - 3x + 4y = 0 \)

Here, both \( x \) and \( y \) are functions of \( t \). The solutions to these equations are expressed as:

- \( x(t) = e^{-5t} \)
- \( y(t) = 2e^{-5t} \)

These solutions indicate a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \), specifically \( y = 2x \).

The text explains that this system can be represented using matrices. By defining a matrix \( X \) with components \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), the derivative of this matrix, \( X' \), can be expressed as:

\[ X' = AX \]

where \( A \) is a coefficient matrix derived from the original system of equations:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -4 \\ 4 & -7 \end{bmatrix} \]

The product \( AX \) results in expressions for \( x' \) and \( y' \), aligning with the derivatives found from the solutions.

The text distinguishes between homogeneous systems (where an additional function \( f(t) = 0 \)) and non-homogeneous systems (where \( f(t) \neq 0 \)). The aim is to solve for a set of functions that satisfy these matrix equations, exploring linear dependency concepts in future discussions.

The text introduces a series on advanced topics in differential equations, focusing on using matrix equations to solve linear systems. It begins by presenting two coupled first-order linear differential equations involving functions \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), which are dependent on the variable \( t \). These equations form a system that must be solved together because they share common variables.

The solutions for these differential equations are given as:
- \( x(t) = e^{-5t} \)
- \( y(t) = 2e^{-5t} \)

These solutions show a proportional relationship between \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), expressed as \( y = 2x \). This linear relationship can be visualized in a phase plane, where the trajectory forms a line with a slope of 2.

The text then introduces matrix notation to represent the system. The vector function \( \mathbf{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\ y(t) \end{bmatrix} \) is expressed as:
\[ \mathbf{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} e^{-5t} \\ 2e^{-5t} \end{bmatrix} \]

The derivative \( \mathbf{x}'(t) \) can be computed and represented in matrix form:
\[ \mathbf{x}'(t) = \begin{bmatrix} -5e^{-5t} \\ -10e^{-5t} \end{bmatrix} \]

A matrix \( A \) is introduced to relate \( \mathbf{x}(t) \) and its derivative:
\[ \mathbf{x}'(t) = A\mathbf{x}(t) \]
where
\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -4 \\ 4 & -7 \end{bmatrix} \]

This matrix \( A \) is derived from the coefficients of the original differential equations, showing how matrix multiplication can represent the system:
- The first row corresponds to the equation \( x' = 3x - 4y \)
- The second row corresponds to the equation \( y' = 4x - 7y \)

The text explains that this setup leads to a homogeneous linear system when there is no additional function of \( t \) on the right-hand side. If such a function exists, the system becomes non-homogeneous.

The series will continue by exploring concepts like linear dependency and solutions for these types of systems, aiming to clarify how matrices are used in solving differential equations.
