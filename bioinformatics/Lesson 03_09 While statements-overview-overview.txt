The text describes how a `while` loop operates in programming by illustrating its use with an integer variable `i`, initially set to 1. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5. During each iteration, it prints the current value of `i` and increments it using shorthand notation (`i += 1`). This continues until `i` exceeds 5, causing the loop to exit. Unlike a `for` loop where variables are limited to its scope, `i` here exists outside the loop, maintaining its value after completion. The text highlights that shorthand notation is widely used for simplicity and clarity across programming languages. It underscores the utility of loops in executing code multiple times based on conditions, demonstrating their power and flexibility in coding.
