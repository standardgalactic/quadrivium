The text discusses solving non-exact differential equations by converting them into exact ones using an integrating factor. An equation is not exact if the condition \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial y} \neq \frac{\partial m}{\partial x}\) holds for what appears to be an exact form. To resolve this, we multiply the entire equation by an integrating factor (\(\mu\)), which makes it exact.

The text outlines a method to find this integrating factor:

1. **Integrating Factor as a Function of \(x\):**
   - Assume \(\mu\) is only a function of \(x\). This simplifies the partial derivative \(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial y}\) to zero.
   - The equation reduces to \(\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \left(\frac{\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x}{n}\right)\).
   - Solve for \(\mu\) by separating variables and integrating: 
     \[
     \ln |\mu| = \int \left(\frac{\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x}{n}\right) dx
     \]
   - Exponentiate to find \(\mu(x)\).

2. **Integrating Factor as a Function of \(y\):**
   - Assume \(\mu\) is only a function of \(y\). This simplifies the partial derivative \(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial x}\) to zero.
   - The equation becomes \(\frac{d\mu}{dy} = \left(\frac{\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y}{m}\right)\).
   - Solve for \(\mu\) by separating variables and integrating:
     \[
     \ln |\mu| = \int \left(\frac{\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y}{m}\right) dy
     \]
   - Exponentiate to find \(\mu(y)\).

The choice between these two methods depends on whether the expression \((\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x)/n\) is only a function of \(x\) or if \((\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y)/m\) is only a function of \(y\). If neither condition holds, the method may not work. The text suggests trying both approaches to find an appropriate integrating factor that makes the differential equation exact.
