The text discusses solving non-exact differential equations by converting them into exact ones using an integrating factor. An equation is not exact if the condition \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial y} \neq \frac{\partial m}{\partial x}\) holds for what appears to be an exact form. To resolve this, we multiply the entire equation by an integrating factor (\(\mu\)), which makes it exact.

The text outlines a method to find this integrating factor:

1. **Integrating Factor as a Function of \(x\):**
   - Assume \(\mu\) is only a function of \(x\). This simplifies the partial derivative \(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial y}\) to zero.
   - The equation reduces to \(\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \left(\frac{\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x}{n}\right)\).
   - Solve for \(\mu\) by separating variables and integrating: 
     \[
     \ln |\mu| = \int \left(\frac{\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x}{n}\right) dx
     \]
   - Exponentiate to find \(\mu(x)\).

2. **Integrating Factor as a Function of \(y\):**
   - Assume \(\mu\) is only a function of \(y\). This simplifies the partial derivative \(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial x}\) to zero.
   - The equation becomes \(\frac{d\mu}{dy} = \left(\frac{\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y}{m}\right)\).
   - Solve for \(\mu\) by separating variables and integrating:
     \[
     \ln |\mu| = \int \left(\frac{\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y}{m}\right) dy
     \]
   - Exponentiate to find \(\mu(y)\).

The choice between these two methods depends on whether the expression \((\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x)/n\) is only a function of \(x\) or if \((\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y)/m\) is only a function of \(y\). If neither condition holds, the method may not work. The text suggests trying both approaches to find an appropriate integrating factor that makes the differential equation exact.

The text discusses a method to solve differential equations that are almost exact but not quite. An exact differential equation satisfies the condition where the partial derivative of one component with respect to one variable equals the partial derivative of another component with respect to the other variable. When this condition is not met, an integrating factor can be used to transform it into an exact equation.

The text outlines how to find such an integrating factor, denoted as \(\mu\), by initially assuming it could be a function of either \(x\) or \(y\) alone. If \(\mu\) is assumed to depend only on \(x\), the partial derivative with respect to \(y\) vanishes, simplifying the equation. This leads to an expression where \(\frac{\partial m}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial n}{\partial x}\) divided by \(n\) must be a function of \(x\) only. Solving this gives \(\mu(x)\).

Conversely, if \(\mu\) is assumed to depend only on \(y\), the partial derivative with respect to \(x\) vanishes, resulting in an expression where \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y}\) divided by \(m\) must be a function of \(y\) only. Solving this gives \(\mu(y)\).

The text emphasizes that either approach can be used to find the integrating factor, depending on which simplifies the equation. Once an appropriate \(\mu\) is found and applied, the differential equation becomes exact, allowing for standard methods to solve it. An example is suggested to illustrate these concepts further.
