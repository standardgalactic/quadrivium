The text outlines a method for comparing group means using an F distribution in Julia within Visual Studio Code. Here's a structured summary of the process:

### Overview
- **Objective**: To simulate and compare differences in means between three groups using the F distribution.

### Steps Involved

1. **Packages Used**:
   - Essential packages include `dataframes`, `random`, `distributions`, `statsplots`, and `base` for data handling, random number generation, statistical analysis, plotting, and basic functions.

2. **F Distribution Explanation**:
   - The F distribution is characterized by two parameters related to the numerator and denominator of the F statistic, differing from symmetric distributions like the normal distribution.

3. **Data Setup**:
   - A dataset with 300 samples is created, divided into three groups (100 each).
   - An `id` column ranges from 1 to 300.
   - The `group` variable categorizes data points using a categorical function and repetition.

4. **Continuous Variable Generation**:
   - A continuous variable, `mass`, is generated for each group from different normal distributions with specified means and standard deviations (e.g., Group 1: mean = 98, SD = 20).

5. **DataFrame Creation**:
   - A DataFrame (`df`) is constructed with columns for `id`, `group`, and `mass`.

6. **F Ratio Calculation**:
   - The process involves calculating the sum of squared errors for both a mean model (single overall mean) and a fitted model (individual group means).
   - An F ratio is computed to compare these models.

7. **Randomization Test**:
   - Under the null hypothesis that all group means are equal, data points are shuffled and reassigned to groups.
   - A new F ratio is calculated for each random grouping.

8. **Simulation**:
   - This shuffling and recalculating process is repeated 20,000 times to generate a sampling distribution of F ratios.

9. **Histogram Analysis**:
   - The distribution of simulated F ratios is visualized using histograms.
   - The observed F ratio is compared against this distribution to assess its extremity.

10. **Probability Calculation**:
    - By counting how many simulated F ratios are as extreme or more than the observed one, a p-value is estimated.

### Purpose
- This simulation helps determine if the observed differences between group means are statistically significant under the null hypothesis by comparing the observed F statistic against the distribution generated through randomization.

The text discusses a statistical analysis comparing modern simulation-based methods with traditional approaches. It highlights that the calculated probability (0.039), derived from simulations, aligns well with traditional p-value computations using an F distribution. Since this estimated p-value is below the 0.05 threshold, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating significant differences between group means. The analysis suggests proceeding to a post hoc test following this rejection. A count map function supports these findings by showing that 773 out of 20,000 simulated values exceeded the observed F ratio, reinforcing the calculated probability's validity. Overall, the approach demonstrates using simulation and randomization as effective tools for assessing statistical significance in hypothesis testing.
