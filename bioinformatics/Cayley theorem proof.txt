So in this video, we're going to prove Cayley's theorem. Now, I've made this video before,
but I was not really happy with it. I wasn't happy with the way that I explained it. So
in this video, with a lot of noise outside as we're building a new neuroscience unit right
outside my window there, let's prove Cayley's theorem. First of all, some definitions. I want
to define isomorphic there because what we want to prove with Cayley's theorem is that every group
is isomorphic to a permutation group. Every group is isomorphic to a permutation group. So let's just
define what it means to be isomorphic. And as I write here with my terrible board handwriting that
it defines this and put an inverted comms relationship between two groups. And I set my
group up A and my group B. And the group A consists of a set which I call A subscript set and some
binary operation and B which consists of a set and its own binary operation. And I make this
distinction between these two binary operations. They obviously not need not be similar and I want
to show that they're not similar. And this relationship that I'm setting up is this bijective function.
And I'm going to call my function F. And F maps the set of group A to the set of group B
such that for all elements in A and I'm just taking two generic ones A subscript 1 and A subscript 2.
So for all those elements under this mapping if I take the binary operation between any two elements
in A that is equal to if I take this mapping of the one element and I take separately the mapping of the
second element and I do the other group's binary operation that these two things are equal.
So with that in mind you can clearly see that one thing that you could possibly see by now is that
the order of this set must equal the order of that set because if it's a bijective mapping it must map
one element to one element one to one one to one and that's it. There can't be two two-year mapping to the
same. There can't be any there that are not mapped to nothing. This has got to be a bijective function.
So I want before we do this and then before we actually prove Cayley's theorem
and look at this relationship between a group and show that it's isomorphic to a permutation group.
Let's look at an example. So I've got my two groups here. I've called it group G and group H
and G is just the fourth roots of one. So I've got one negative one I and negative I under the
group operation of multiplication. I'm saying that is isomorphic to another group which is the integers mod 4
under modular addition. So is this true? Can I find this bijective mapping between those two?
So let's just look at what the set here is of each set and that is simply going to be
0, 1, 2, and 3. Those equivalence classes 0, 1, 2, and 3. And under modular addition
it just means I take a representative element of any of these equivalence classes and I add it to a
representative of any of the other two and I get back one of these modular addition.
So let's see if I can find a mapping and I'm going to call my mapping here F
and you'll forgive me for not writing these square brackets every time. I'm just going to write 0,
1, 2, and 3 so you'll know what I mean. And I'm going to have the following. I'm going to suggest that
the F of 1 and that now 1 is an element of G set remember I'm going to say that that is 0 and I'm
going to say the F of 2 is I should not say 2 it's negative 1. I'm going to say that that is 2.
The F of i is going to be 3 my equivalence class 3 there and F of minus i is going to be 1.
So I want you to do the following. I want you to go through if we look at Cayley's table of g.
Cayley's table of g that we have there it's under multiplication. I have my four elements there
and 1 minus 1 i minus i and we can fill in the 16 values there and then the same we can do the same
for h and remember that's going to be under modular addition and I have 0 1 2 and 3 0 1 2 and 3.
And I'm going to leave you just with this so let's just do just do one of them. Let's suggest we do the
F of we're going to do the F of let's do minus 1 times i and I'm saying that this must really equal
the F of minus 1 and this is modular addition for the second one modular addition for the second one
so that must be plus F of i. And what is minus 1 times i? Well that was minus 1 times i
if you filled in obviously if you filled in this table it's just normal multiplication we know that's
negative i so that's the F of negative i and I'm very I'm hoping very much that this is going to equal
the right hand side so the F of negative 1 in my mapping is 2. 2 and the F of i i said is 3.
And what is the F of minus i? Well that's the equivalence class 1 and 2 plus 3 is 5 minus 4 is 1.
There we go those are equal to each other and I have at least in that one case I've shown that I do have
uh this fact that I have right here which is the way that we're going to define this isomorphism
that we define this isomorphism this muscle. So what I would like you to do is just take some time and
do all of these. So start with 1 do all the multiplications negative 1 with those i with that
and just negative i with itself and just look at this fill in this but and you'll see that this is
indeed a bijective mapping and we have shown that the fourth roots of one under multiplication that
group is isomorphic to the group of the integers mod 4 under modular addition. So you've seen a nice
example of it but we really want to ramp it up now to say that okay we fully understand this idea of
isomorphism can I show that every group any group that I take any generic group that it is isomorphic
to some permutation group so let's just think of a permutation group though we've looked at s4
or let's just think of s4 or let's make it s3 it's easier to do the symmetric group on three elements
that is all the permutations on those three elements so we just if we just looked at cycle notation we had
e that is just the identity we had tau one two which was just one comma two in cycle notation one goes
to two two goes to one and three stays with three we had tau one three and that is one two three three
to one and two stays we had tau two three and that just mapped two to three and three to two in one stayed
by the same we had sigma and sigma took one to two and two to three and three to one in cycle notation and
if we did that twice we had that one goes to three three goes to two and two goes back to one we had
that but if we just looked at c3 c3 that was just some of the permutations we just selectively took e
for that and we took sigma and we took sigma squared that gave gave us the three cycles to give us the
cyclic that gave us the cyclic group in three elements so this is a permutation group we've
just taken selectively that is s3 is a permutation group it's just the permutations under the binary
operation of the composition of these of these permutations c3 is just selectively some of those
that's a permutation group under the group composition of just composing those permutations with each other
so that is what we want to say we want to say that any group that i take is isomorphic to a permutation
group and we know what a permutation group is and if you think about it that's how we've constructed
it this far when we looked at the symmetric groups well we constructed it by taking all the permutations
of elements and just giving each of them a name we just gave them a symbol and basically the same for
cyclic group for dihedral groups we actually constructed it from just a permutation on a set
of elements but now we want to go much further with Cayley's theorem and we want to say no matter
what group we have if we start with a group and we didn't construct it from there that it is actually
that it is actually isomorphic to a permutation group so i can i can do this so my problem that i'm
going to have is i'm going to have a group with elements but i'm not given what this permutation
group is so how am i going to construct this permutation group so that i can show that if i do
this if i can find this that i can find this function now to find this function i better know what
this is because remember this f a1 and f a2 and those are going to be elements of the permutation group so i
better construct this permutation group but the only thing that i have is the group that i'm starting
with so clear the board and we'll carry on okay so i've cleaned the board one more thing that i want
to just tackle here is just this idea of a bijective we've got to find this not only do we have to
construct this this permutation group but we've also really just got to remind ourselves what it means
for f to be a function be a bijective mapping so i just want to remind you of that a bijective let's
get the green kind of bijective mapping so consider for me two sets a and b so as is my usual notation
i'm going to write a sub set and a subscript and b subscript set so if it is injective what does it
mean to be injective is that it means i have this mapping this function f and it maps elements in a to
elements in b elements in set a to elements in set b and how does it do that well if for all
elements and i'm going to use just two genetic ones a sub one and a sub two elements of a
if then if i have the statement that the mapping of a1 equals the mapping of a2 it implies that a1
equals a2 that is our definition these are our definitions we as human beings decided this is how
we're defining an injective mapping so for all a1 and a2 elements of a if we have the statement
f of a1 equals f of a2 it implies that a1 equals a2 and for surjective again this mapping of a to b
sets a to b if for all b so i'm just taking any b in there they exist an a element in a
such that the f of a will give me b so i'm saying that every b on the second my second set there
has this element that maps to it that means it's surjective and if i have something that is both
injective and surjective if i have something that's both injective and surjective it is bijective
so if i'm if i need to construct the scalies proof i've got to find this f now remember all i'm going to
have is this group so i'm going to know what its set is and what its group permutation is what this group
binary operation is and that's all i have i have got to find the permutation group in my proof
and i've got to find this function that is bijective so it better have both of those properties and it
better allow for this to happen then i have shown that that's an isomorphism and if i put all those
together i have proven cayley's theorem so let me clean the board and we'll carry on good first then
let's look at the construction of this and i'm going to use an example again i'm going to have my
ace a is going to be my group and under this group i'm just going to have again i'm going to use this
example the fourth roots that we have of one i and negative i and we're going to have that under
multiplication so that would be a group that i have and i'm going to show that it is isomorphic to a
permutation group by constructing this magical project of mapping and i'm going to do that for
you and we're going to construct this mapping i'm going to call it f subscript a some textbooks use
by up subscript a it doesn't matter and g equals a g that is going to be our magical mapping okay and
this is for all a comma g elements in this whatever and in this instance it is this so let me just show
you how we construct then this is very easy let's start off with the a being one a being one so what
i'm going to have is one times one i'm going to have one times negative one and i'm going to have one times
i i'm going to have one times negative i and that's going to give me this permutation
one negative one i the negative i there's a permutation on the set of my elements that's all i have
so let's make a equal to negative one what are we going to have negative one times one is we're going
to have negative one we're going to have one negative one is we're going to have negative i
and we're going to have i there's another permutation let's make a equal to i i times one is i
i times negative one is negative i and i times i is negative one and one there's another permutation
and i'm going to let i equals negative i and now i'm going to have a negative i i better not make
a mistake negative i negative i it's just i and i times i is negative one times one is just one
and negative one and lo and behold i have four permutations so it's very easy if i use this
mapping if i use this mapping to give me a permutation set now i can call these permutations
p1 p2 say p3 and p4 and what i have now is this p my permutation group and i haven't shown that it's
a group but it is so let's just do that it's p1 p2 p3 p4 and under the under the binary operation there
of just the combination of these permutations so i have constructed this i can construct
this permutation i'm not going to show now that it's the permutation group i just want to show you
if you see in your textbooks what this is what this mapping is this bijective mapping that we're going
to have that this is how we would construct it if you see it you just take each one of these and use
its binary operation there with all of the others all of the others all of the others and you are going
to construct different permutations on this set and we've looked at those proof say of of the uniqueness
and the completeness of all the rows and all the columns in Cayley's table so we've looked at that
not to worry now we can construct from that we can construct at least some elements that are permutations
of just that of course we have we'll have 24 permutations on four so we're not using all of that and
definitely we can't if it's isomorphic we only need four so we know that there's somehow we've got
to show that one of these is going to map to one of those you know one each one of these is going to
map to each one of those and under this i'm going to show you now you know that we can construct this
proving Cayley's theorem again clean board let's have a look so we've done all of that so let's have a
look i have this magical function i've shown you how what what it does so if you give me any group i can
construct some permutations on the set of that group and it'll be equal in number to the elements
by this function so i'm saying let's have this now let's just prove that it's injective and prove that
it's surjective so let's have a look at it remember that i have my group g it contains a set and a binary
operation so i'm saying let this mapping and i've shown you how to create this one equals that one
so how is it created well it's right there it says a composed with g1 and on this side we have a
composed of g2 and remember this is for all a g1 and g2 elements of g set very easy now this is a group
if a is in there it's inverse must be in there i can left multiply i'm just using multiply but it's
this binary operation g1 i do the same on this side a and g2 i can use associativity it is a group
and the binary operation with an element and its inverse is the identity element
and the identity element composed with any of the elements is just that so i have g1 equals g2
so if this is true then that implies that that is true i have shown that it is injective now a bit more
difficult let's just think about how to prove that it's surjective well let's take an element of the
set any element of the set for all a and g and that and i'm just going to write g in a slightly
different way i'm going to say a composed with a in composed of a inverse composed with g and if i do
that associativity element and its inverse identity element identity element and the element is just the
element so i can really rewrite that now let's just use the associative property so i can rewrite that
as a inverse and g no problem there and let's just call this put let's just call this bit g prime
and by closure property it's still an element of g set so i'm writing that g equals a composed with g prime
but isn't that just the definition that i've got here so what have i got here it says that for all g
elements of g set they exist to this element g prime element of g set
so that i have that the f a of g prime is going to give me g because remember how do i write this it's a
composed of g prime and i've just shown it is there because that is g in other words
every one that you give me in g i can map to by this function in other words it is surjective and
what do i have i have this magical mapping that is bijective you've given me some arbitrary group
i've shown you how to construct a same number of permutations on that by that and i've proven
cayley serum for every group or every group at least is isomorphic to a permutation group as simple as that
