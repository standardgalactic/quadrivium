The text delves into advanced mathematical concepts applied to life sciences and other domains, emphasizing the importance of understanding functions' behavior as time approaches infinity for modeling long-term processes like epidemics. Key topics include:

1. **Continuity and Derivatives**: Continuity is essential for calculating derivatives, requiring limits to identify potential discontinuities or gaps in a function's graph.

2. **Types of Discontinuities**:
   - **Non-removable Discontinuities**: Functions like \(\ln(t)\) (undefined for \(t \leq 0\)) and those with vertical asymptotes, such as the tangent function, illustrate non-removable discontinuities.
   - **Removable Discontinuities**: These occur in rational functions that can be "fixed" algebraically by factoring, though careful modeling is necessary to represent these points accurately.

3. **Limits at Infinity**: For functions of the form \(\frac{a}{t^k}\), where \(a\) is a constant and \(k > 0\), the limit as \(t\) approaches infinity is zero.

4. **Indeterminate Forms**: Situations like \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\) require specific techniques for resolution.

5. **Limit Laws and Simplification**: Techniques such as dividing by the highest power in the denominator help simplify complex limits, exemplified by \(\lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{t^2 + 2}{t^3 + 2t^2 + t - 2}\) simplifying to zero.

6. **Trigonometric Limits**: The behavior of trigonometric functions near zero is explored, noting that limits like \(\frac{\sin t}{t}\) and \(\frac{t}{\sin t}\) approach 1 as \(t\) approaches zero, while \(\cos(\frac{1}{t})\) and \(\sin(\frac{1}{t})\) do not exist due to infinite oscillation.

These concepts are crucial for understanding function behavior in calculus, particularly when evaluating discontinuities and complex limits. The text ends with a repeated word "Excellent," indicating approval but offering no further context.
