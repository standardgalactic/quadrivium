The text outlines several risk factors that contribute to pulmonary complications in the context of surgery:

1. **Smoking**: Increases risks for pulmonary issues, notably mechanical ventilation needs. Smokers with FEV1 less than 40% are at higher risk for bronchospasm. It is advised to stop smoking at least eight weeks before elective surgery.

2. **Asthma**: Active symptoms like wheezing or reduced peak flow heighten the risk of bronchospasm during intubation, especially if asthma is poorly controlled through symptoms such as morning coughs and frequent hospitalizations for nebulization.

3. **Recent Infections**: Upper respiratory infections suggest a two-week delay before surgery, while lower respiratory infections require a four-week delay to mitigate complications.

4. **Obesity**: Associated with increased pulmonary risks due to difficult airway management and obstructive sleep apnea, potentially leading to extended ICU stays.

5. **Surgery Duration and Site**: Longer surgeries and upper abdominal procedures pose higher pulmonary risks compared to shorter or lower abdominal ones.

6. **Nutritional Status and Renal Function**: Low albumin levels and poor renal function predict complications, with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) being a key measure of kidney health. Acute renal injury is indicated by changes in GFR or creatinine post-surgery.

7. **Post-operative Pain**: Can lead to immobilization, increasing the risk of atelectasis and infection due to reduced mobility.

8. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Especially potassium disturbances can affect muscle function and cardiac rhythm, influencing recovery and ventilation weaning.

These factors are crucial for pre-operative assessments and management strategies aimed at minimizing pulmonary complications during surgery.
