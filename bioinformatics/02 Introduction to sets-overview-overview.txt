The text introduces sets as fundamental components in mathematics, especially within abstract algebra, and highlights their importance for understanding discrete mathematics and proofs. A set is defined as a well-defined collection of elements, denoted by capital letters with elements enclosed in curly braces. Examples include:
- Example 1 (A1): Natural numbers up to 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
- Example 2 (A2): Natural numbers divisible by 5: {5, 10, 15, ...}.

The text also defines standard mathematical sets:
- \(\mathbb{N}\) (natural numbers): {1, 2, 3, ...}
- \(\mathbb{Z}\) (integers): {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
- \(\mathbb{Q}\) (rational numbers): fractions \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers and \(q \neq 0\)
- \(\mathbb{R}\) (real numbers), encompassing both rational and irrational numbers.

It clarifies that two sets are equal if they contain the same elements, irrespective of repetition. The concept of subsets is introduced as a topic for further exploration in the course.
