The text explains the process of using Frobenius' method to solve differential equations with regular singular points. The solution involves finding a series expansion for \( y \) in terms of powers of \( (x - x_0) \), where \( x_0 \) is the point of singularity. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Frobenius Method**: This method is applied to second-order differential equations with regular singular points, allowing solutions in the form of a power series multiplied by \( (x - x_0)^r \).

2. **Series Formulation**: The solution is expressed as:
   \[
   y = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n (x - x_0)^{n+r}
   \]
   where \( r \) is a constant to be determined, and \( C_n \) are the coefficients of the series.

3. **Derivatives**: When taking derivatives:
   - The first derivative involves terms like \( (n + r)(x - x_0)^{n + r - 1} \).
   - The second derivative involves terms like \( (n + r)(n + r - 1)(x - x_0)^{n + r - 2} \).

4. **Initial Conditions**: Unlike standard power series, the Frobenius method requires starting from \( n = 0 \) for derivatives because of the additional factor \( (x - x_0)^r \).

5. **Solving for Coefficients**: The coefficients \( C_n \) are determined iteratively, often expressed in terms of initial coefficients like \( C_0 \) and \( C_1 \).

6. **Determining \( r \)**: A key step is solving an indicial equation to find the value of \( r \), which influences the form of the solution.

The text plans to illustrate these concepts with examples, focusing on cases where \( x_0 = 0 \).
