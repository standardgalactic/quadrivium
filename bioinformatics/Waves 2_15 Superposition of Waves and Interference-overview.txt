The text describes a physics problem involving wave interference on a rope. Here's a summary:

1. **Basic Setup**: A rope with known linear density and tension is used to transmit waves. A single wave with an angular frequency of 1,200 inverse seconds and amplitude of 3 millimeters is sent along the rope.

2. **Average Power Calculation**: The formula for average power is given as \(\frac{1}{2} \mu v \omega^2 A^2\), where:
   - \(\mu\) = linear density
   - \(v\) = wave velocity (calculated from tension and linear density)
   - \(\omega\) = angular frequency
   - \(A\) = amplitude

3. **Power for One Wave**: Using the given values, the average power transmitted is calculated to be approximately 10 watts.

4. **Interference with Two Waves**:
   - Sending two separate waves on two ropes results in a total power of 20 watts.
   - Combining both waves on one rope increases the power due to interference effects.

5. **Interference Effects**:
   - If the phase difference (\(\phi\)) is zero, the resultant amplitude doubles, leading to four times more power (40 watts) than sending them separately.
   - If \(\phi\) is \(\pi\) radians (half a wavelength), destructive interference occurs, resulting in zero net power.

6. **Conclusion**: The problem illustrates how wave interference can significantly affect energy transfer, with constructive interference increasing power and destructive interference canceling it out. This example demonstrates simple algebraic calculations without requiring calculus.
