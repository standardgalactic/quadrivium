The text introduces the concept of cosets in group theory, focusing on a group \( G \) and its subgroup \( H \). It defines a relation between elements \( A \) and \( B \) in \( G \), where \( A \) is related to \( B \) if \( A^{-1}B \in H \), forming what is known as a left coset. This relation is proven to be an equivalence relation by satisfying reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties. The resulting equivalence classes are termed cosets, specifically denoted as \( AH \) for the left coset with representative \( A \). Future discussions will delve into expressing these cosets as sets and proving their equality through mutual subset relationships. This foundation in understanding cosets prepares for further exploration of their properties and applications within group theory.
