The text provides instructions for determining the ground state electron configuration of cadmium (atomic number 48) by constructing an orbital filling table from scratch. Here's a summary:

1. **Orbital Filling Rules**: 
   - The principal quantum number \( n \) and the azimuthal quantum number \( l \) must satisfy \( l < n \).
   - When multiple combinations of \( n + l \) yield the same sum, orbitals are filled in order of increasing \( n \).

2. **Constructing the Table**:
   - For each possible value of \( n \), calculate possible values of \( l \) (where \( l \) ranges from 0 to \( n-1 \)).
   - Calculate \( n + l \) for each combination and fill orbitals in ascending order of \( n + l \). If there's a tie, use the lower \( n \).

3. **Electron Capacity**:
   - The maximum number of electrons in an orbital is given by \( 2(2l + 1) \).
   - For each subshell (defined by specific \( n \) and \( l \)), calculate its electron capacity.

4. **Example Calculations**:
   - For \( n = 1, l = 0 \): Maximum electrons = 2.
   - For \( n = 2, l = 0 \) and \( l = 1 \): Maximum electrons = 2 and 6 respectively.
   - Continue this process for higher values of \( n \) to fill up to 48 electrons.

By following these rules and calculations, one can determine the electron configuration for cadmium as:  
\[ \text{[Kr]} \, 4d^{10} \, 5s^2 \]  
This accounts for all 48 electrons in cadmium.

The text describes the construction of an electron configuration table and explains how to determine the number of electrons in various atomic shells using quantum numbers.

1. **Electron Configuration Construction:**
   - The author builds a table for electron distribution across different energy levels (n) and sublevels (l), identifying s, p, d, f, g, h orbitals.
   - For each principal quantum number \( n \), the possible values of the azimuthal quantum number \( l \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - The text provides specific electron capacities for different sublevels: 
     - \( s \): 2 electrons (\( l = 0 \))
     - \( p \): 6 electrons (\( l = 1 \))
     - \( d \): 10 electrons (\( l = 2 \))
     - \( f \): 14 electrons (\( l = 3 \))

2. **Electron Configuration for Cadmium (Z=48):**
   - The configuration is written as: 
     - \( 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^6, 3s^2, 3p^6, 4s^2, 3d^{10}, 4p^6, 5s^2, 4d^{10} \)

3. **Maximum Electrons in the N=5 Shell:**
   - The text calculates that the fifth shell (N=5) can hold a maximum of 50 electrons by summing the capacities of all possible sublevels within this shell.

4. **Allowed Electron Configurations:**
   - \( 3s^1 \): Allowed, as \( n = 3 \), \( l = 0 \)
   - \( 2d^1 \): Not allowed, since \( n = 2 \) cannot have \( l = 2 \)
   - \( 3p^7 \): Not allowed, as \( p \) sublevel can hold a maximum of 6 electrons
   - \( 5f^{14} \): Allowed, as \( n = 5 \), \( l = 3 \)

The text provides a detailed explanation of how to determine electron configurations and the constraints based on quantum numbers.
