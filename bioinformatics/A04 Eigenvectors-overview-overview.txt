Here's a concise summary of the text:

1. **Objective**: Solve a system of linear differential equations by finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

2. **Matrix Setup**:
   - Form matrix \( A \) and subtract \( \lambda I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix.
   - Set the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \) to zero to find eigenvalues.

3. **Eigenvalue Calculation**:
   - For a 2x2 matrix, calculate two eigenvalues: \( \lambda_1 = -2 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 6 \).

4. **Eigenvector for \( \lambda_1 \)**:
   - Solve \( (A + 2I)K = 0 \).
   - Obtain eigenvector \( [1, -1] \) from the equation \( K_1 + K_2 = 0 \).

5. **Solution Interpretation**:
   - The solution is expressed as \( X = e^{-2t} \) and \( Y = -e^{-2t} \).

6. **Eigenvector for \( \lambda_2 \)**:
   - Solve \( (A - 6I)K = 0 \).
   - Derive the relationship \( 5K_3 = 3K_4 \).
   - Choose \( K_4 = 5 \) and \( K_3 = 3 \), resulting in eigenvector \( [3, 5] \).

7. **Solution Confirmation**:
   - Verify that solutions match given answers, confirming the correctness of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The process involves using characteristic equations to determine eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, which are then used to express the differential equation solutions.
