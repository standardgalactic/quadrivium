Certainly! The task at hand involves implementing Heun's Method (a type of Runge-Kutta method) for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). You are aiming to approximate solutions over a specified interval, starting from an initial condition. Below is an outline and explanation of how you can implement this in Python using the information provided:

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define Constants and Initial Values:**
   - Set your initial conditions for \( x \) and \( y \).
   - Define the step size `h`.
   - Specify the upper limit for \( x \), which determines when to stop iterating.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - Define the differential equation \( f(x, y) = 2xy \).

3. **Implement Heun's Method Loop:**
   - Use a loop to iterate until \( x \) reaches or exceeds your upper limit (e.g., 1.5).
   - For each iteration:
     - Compute the predicted value of \( y \) using Euler’s method (`y_star`), which is \( y + h \cdot f(x, y) \).
     - Calculate the slope at the beginning and end of the interval: `m = f(x, y)` and `m_star = f(x + h, y_star)`.
     - Update \( y \) using Heun’s correction formula: 
       \[
       y = y + \frac{h}{2} (m + m\_star)
       \]
     - Increment \( x \) by the step size `h`.

4. **Print or Store Results:**
   - Print or store each pair of \( x \) and \( y \) values for analysis.

### Python Code

Here's a simple implementation of Heun’s Method in Python:

```python
# Define constants and initial conditions
x = 1.0
y = 1.0
h = 0.1
upper_limit = 1.5

# Define the differential equation f(x, y) = 2xy
def f(x, y):
    return 2 * x * y

# Print initial values
print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}")

# Heun's Method Loop
while x < upper_limit:
    # Compute the slope at the current point (m)
    m = f(x, y)
    
    # Predict next value using Euler's method
    y_star = y + h * m
    
    # Compute the slope at the predicted point (m_star)
    m_star = f(x + h, y_star)
    
    # Correct the prediction with Heun's formula
    y = y + (h / 2) * (m + m_star)
    
    # Increment x by step size
    x += h
    
    # Print current values of x and y
    print(f"x: {x:.1f}, y: {y:.3f}")
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization:** Start with initial conditions \( x = 1.0 \) and \( y = 1.0 \), and a step size `h` of 0.1.
- **Function Definition:** The function \( f(x, y) = 2xy \) represents the differential equation to be solved.
- **Loop Execution:**
  - Calculate the initial slope (`m`) at the current point.
  - Use Euler's method to predict the next value of \( y \) (`y_star`).
  - Compute the slope at this predicted point (`m_star`).
  - Update \( y \) using Heun’s correction formula, which averages the slopes.
  - Increment \( x \) by `h`.
- **Output:** Print each step's \( x \) and corrected \( y \).

This code will iterate through values of \( x \) from 1.0 to 1.5 in steps of 0.1, updating and printing the corresponding \( y \) values calculated using Heun’s Method. Adjust `upper_limit` or `h` for different ranges or step sizes as needed.
