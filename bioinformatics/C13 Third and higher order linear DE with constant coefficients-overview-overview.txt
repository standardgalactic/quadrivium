The text outlines methods for solving higher-order differential equations by examining their auxiliary (characteristic) equations and focusing on real root scenarios. For differential equations of order greater than 2, the solution construction involves analyzing the roots of the auxiliary equation:

- **Real and Distinct Roots**: If the auxiliary equation has distinct real roots (\( m_1, m_2, m_3 \), etc.), the general solution is a linear combination of exponential terms \( c_1 e^{m_1 x}, c_2 e^{m_2 x}, \) and so forth.

- **Repeated Roots**: If all roots are equal (e.g., \( m_1 = m_2 = m_3 \)), the solution includes terms with powers of \( x \) multiplied by an exponential function: \( c_1 e^{m_1 x}, c_2 x e^{m_1 x}, c_3 x^2 e^{m_1 x} \), up to the \((k-1)\)-th power, where \( k \) is the root's multiplicity.

The text specifies that only real roots will be considered in this course, excluding complex conjugate roots. The examples provided illustrate how solutions are constructed based on whether the roots are distinct or repeated.
