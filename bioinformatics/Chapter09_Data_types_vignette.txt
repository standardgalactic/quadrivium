In this lecture, I'm going to introduce you to different data types.
We're going to have two classification systems.
We're going to look at categorical data and numerical data,
and we're going to look at discrete and continuous data types.
It's important to understand what data types you work with,
because that will determine what statistical analysis you can do.
