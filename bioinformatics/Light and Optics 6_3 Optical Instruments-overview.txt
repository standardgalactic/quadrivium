The text explains how to calculate the total magnification of a compound microscope using two methods: directly with the magnification formula and by breaking it down into individual lens calculations.

1. **Direct Method**:
   - Use the magnification formula for a compound microscope: 
     \[
     M = \left( \frac{25}{f_{\text{objective}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{f_{\text{eyepiece}}}{25} \right)
     \]
   - Here, \( f_{\text{objective}} \) and \( f_{\text{eyepiece}} \) are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece lenses, respectively.
   - The calculation results in a total magnification of 209.

2. **Step-by-Step Method**:
   - Calculate the magnification for each lens separately.
   - For the objective lens:
     - Determine \( S_0 \) (object distance) using the formula: 
       \[
       \frac{1}{S_0} = \frac{1}{f_{\text{objective}}} - \frac{1}{S_i}
       \]
     - Calculate magnification \( M_1 \) as:
       \[
       M_1 = -\frac{S_i}{S_0}
       \]
   - For the eyepiece lens:
     - Assume a virtual image distance (\( S_i' \)) of -25 cm (since it's on the same side as the object).
     - Calculate \( S_0' \) using:
       \[
       \frac{1}{S_0'} = \frac{1}{f_{\text{eyepiece}}} - \frac{1}{S_i'}
       \]
     - Determine magnification \( M_2 \):
       \[
       M_2 = -\frac{S_i'}{S_0'}
       \]
   - Multiply the magnifications of both lenses to get the total magnification:
     \[
     M_{\text{total}} = M_1 \times M_2
     \]
   - This also results in a total magnification of 209.

The explanation highlights that while the step-by-step method involves more calculations and considerations of lens distances, both methods ultimately yield the same result. The direct method is simpler for quick calculations.
