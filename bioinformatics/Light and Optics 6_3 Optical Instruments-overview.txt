The text explains how to calculate the total magnification of a compound microscope using two methods: directly with the magnification formula and by breaking it down into individual lens calculations.

1. **Direct Method**:
   - Use the magnification formula for a compound microscope: 
     \[
     M = \left( \frac{25}{f_{\text{objective}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{f_{\text{eyepiece}}}{25} \right)
     \]
   - Here, \( f_{\text{objective}} \) and \( f_{\text{eyepiece}} \) are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece lenses, respectively.
   - The calculation results in a total magnification of 209.

2. **Step-by-Step Method**:
   - Calculate the magnification for each lens separately.
   - For the objective lens:
     - Determine \( S_0 \) (object distance) using the formula: 
       \[
       \frac{1}{S_0} = \frac{1}{f_{\text{objective}}} - \frac{1}{S_i}
       \]
     - Calculate magnification \( M_1 \) as:
       \[
       M_1 = -\frac{S_i}{S_0}
       \]
   - For the eyepiece lens:
     - Assume a virtual image distance (\( S_i' \)) of -25 cm (since it's on the same side as the object).
     - Calculate \( S_0' \) using:
       \[
       \frac{1}{S_0'} = \frac{1}{f_{\text{eyepiece}}} - \frac{1}{S_i'}
       \]
     - Determine magnification \( M_2 \):
       \[
       M_2 = -\frac{S_i'}{S_0'}
       \]
   - Multiply the magnifications of both lenses to get the total magnification:
     \[
     M_{\text{total}} = M_1 \times M_2
     \]
   - This also results in a total magnification of 209.

The explanation highlights that while the step-by-step method involves more calculations and considerations of lens distances, both methods ultimately yield the same result. The direct method is simpler for quick calculations.

The text describes how to calculate the total magnification produced by a compound microscope using two methods: directly with an established formula and indirectly through individual lens calculations. Here's a summary:

1. **Direct Calculation Using Formula**:
   - The total magnification \( M \) of a compound microscope is given by the product of the magnifications of the objective lens (\( M_{\text{objective}} \)) and the eyepiece lens (\( M_{\text{eyepiece}} \)).
   - This formula simplifies the process, especially when dealing with virtual images.

2. **Indirect Calculation via Individual Lens Magnifications**:
   - First, calculate the magnification of the objective lens (\( M_1 \)) using the formula \( M_1 = -\frac{S_I}{S_O} \), where \( S_I \) is the image distance and \( S_O \) is the object distance for the objective lens.
   - Next, determine the magnification of the eyepiece lens (\( M_2 \)) using the formula \( M_2 = 1 + \frac{25}{S'_O} \), where \( S'_O \) is the object distance for the eyepiece lens. Here, 25 cm represents the near point distance for a standard observer.
   - The total magnification is then found by multiplying these two individual magnifications: \( M = M_1 \times M_2 \).

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - An example calculation shows how to determine the object and image distances for each lens, ultimately finding that both methods yield a total magnification of 209.
   - The indirect method involves more steps and requires careful consideration of sign conventions (positive or negative values) based on the direction of the light path and whether images are real or virtual.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - While the direct formula is simpler, understanding the step-by-step lens calculations provides deeper insight into how compound microscopes work.
   - Both methods should yield consistent results if calculations are done correctly.
