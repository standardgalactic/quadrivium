Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) occur when excessive fluid accumulation leads to increased pressure within the abdomen. This condition impacts multiple organ systems through various mechanisms:

1. **Fluid Accumulation**: Leads to bowel edema, increasing intra-abdominal pressure.
2. **Cardiovascular Impact**: Compresses the inferior vena cava, reducing cardiac output and possibly leading to multi-organ failure.
3. **Respiratory Changes**: Elevates thoracic pressure, decreasing lung capacity and causing respiratory complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia.
4. **Further Cardiovascular Effects**: Decreases venous return and increases afterload, lowering cardiac output despite stable blood pressure.
5. **Renal Complications**: Impairs kidney function due to compression of renal vessels, leading to oliguria or anuria.
6. **Gastrointestinal Effects**: Reduces perfusion causing mucosal damage and bacterial translocation, potentially resulting in sepsis.
7. **Intracranial Pressure**: Increases intrathoracic pressure, reducing cerebral venous outflow and raising intracranial pressure.

**Prevalence**: IAH is common among patients with severe sepsis (41-85%), those undergoing major surgeries (up to 45%), burns (22-100%), trauma, and pancreatitis.

**Symptoms**: Include abdominal distention, increased respiratory rate, metabolic acidosis unresponsive to fluids, oliguria, hypoxemia resistant to oxygenation, and hypocarbia unresponsive to ventilation.

**Diagnosis and Management**: The World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome recommends screening ICU patients for IAH. Diagnosis involves measuring intra-abdominal pressure using bladder pressure. Early recognition and management are crucial to prevent progression to ACS and multi-organ failure. 

Overall, managing elevated intra-abdominal pressures early is vital in mitigating severe health complications associated with these conditions.
