The text outlines the process of changing variables in a double integral from Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\) to new coordinates \((u, v)\), using the transformations \(x = 2u\) and \(y = u + v\). The original integration region is a rectangle defined by \(1 \leq x \leq 2\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 2\). Under this transformation, the rectangle becomes a parallelogram in the \((u, v)\) coordinate system. 

To account for how areas change under the transformation, the Jacobian determinant is calculated and found to be 2. This means the differential area element \(dy \, dx\) is scaled by a factor of 1/2, resulting in \(dA = 2 \, dv \, du\).

The function originally given as \(f(x, y) = xy\) is transformed into terms of \(u\) and \(v\) to become \(f(u, v) = 2u^2 + 2uv\). The limits for integration in the new coordinates are from \(1/2 \leq u \leq 1\) and \(-u \leq v \leq 2-u\).

When solving the integral with these transformations, constants can be moved outside to simplify calculations. The transformed integral is set up similarly to Cartesian integrals, confirming that both methods yield an identical result of 3 when evaluated correctly. This exercise illustrates how changing variables in integration involves adjusting the integrand and differential area element using the Jacobian determinant to maintain equivalence between different coordinate systems.
