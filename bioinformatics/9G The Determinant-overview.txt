The text explains how an invertible matrix \( A \) can be expressed as a product of the inverses of elementary matrices. Here's a summarized breakdown:

1. **Elementary Matrices**: These are derived from the identity matrix by performing one of three elementary row operations: swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar, or adding/subtracting multiples of rows.

2. **Expressing \( A \)**:
   - If you multiply \( A \) by a series of elementary matrices \( E_1, E_2, ..., E_k \), the result is the identity matrix.
   - Therefore, \( A \) can be expressed as the product of these inverse elementary matrices: \( A = E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}...E_k^{-1} \).

3. **Steps to Find Elementary Matrices**:
   - Start with \( A \) and an identity matrix of the same size.
   - Perform row operations on both simultaneously to convert \( A \) into the identity matrix.
   - The corresponding operations on the identity matrix yield the elementary matrices.

4. **Example** (2x2 Matrix):
   - Begin with a 2x2 invertible matrix and an identity matrix.
   - Apply row operations:
     - Divide the first row by 3, yielding the first elementary matrix.
     - Multiply the first row by 6 and subtract from the second row for the second elementary matrix.
     - Multiply the bottom row by \(-1\) to form the third elementary matrix.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The sequence of these matrices (in reverse order) gives you \( A^{-1} \).
   - By understanding this process, one can express any invertible matrix as a product of elementary matrices.

The text emphasizes memorizing this procedure and being meticulous in applying row operations to avoid mistakes.

The text describes a process of finding the inverse of a matrix using elementary row operations, which are represented as multiplication by elementary matrices. The steps include:

1. **Elementary Operations**: Start with an identity matrix and perform operations such as multiplying rows by constants and subtracting one row from another.

2. **Constructing Elementary Matrices**: Each operation corresponds to an elementary matrix (E1, E2, etc.). These matrices are used to transform the original matrix into its inverse.

3. **Inverse Calculation**: By applying these transformations sequentially, you can find the inverse of the original matrix. The operations are equivalent to multiplying by these elementary matrices in sequence.

4. **Reversibility**: Multiplying the inverse matrices together will return you to the original matrix, confirming the correctness of the inversion process.

5. **Key Statements**: There are three crucial statements or rules related to these operations that should be memorized for exams.

6. **Practical Application**: The method involves systematically applying row operations and keeping track of them using elementary matrices, which allows solving problems involving matrix inverses efficiently.

The text emphasizes understanding and memorizing the fundamental operations involved in this process, as well as constructing the inverse through systematic application of these principles.
