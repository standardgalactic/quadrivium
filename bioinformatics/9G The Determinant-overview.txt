The text explains how an invertible matrix \( A \) can be expressed as a product of the inverses of elementary matrices. Here's a summarized breakdown:

1. **Elementary Matrices**: These are derived from the identity matrix by performing one of three elementary row operations: swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar, or adding/subtracting multiples of rows.

2. **Expressing \( A \)**:
   - If you multiply \( A \) by a series of elementary matrices \( E_1, E_2, ..., E_k \), the result is the identity matrix.
   - Therefore, \( A \) can be expressed as the product of these inverse elementary matrices: \( A = E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}...E_k^{-1} \).

3. **Steps to Find Elementary Matrices**:
   - Start with \( A \) and an identity matrix of the same size.
   - Perform row operations on both simultaneously to convert \( A \) into the identity matrix.
   - The corresponding operations on the identity matrix yield the elementary matrices.

4. **Example** (2x2 Matrix):
   - Begin with a 2x2 invertible matrix and an identity matrix.
   - Apply row operations:
     - Divide the first row by 3, yielding the first elementary matrix.
     - Multiply the first row by 6 and subtract from the second row for the second elementary matrix.
     - Multiply the bottom row by \(-1\) to form the third elementary matrix.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The sequence of these matrices (in reverse order) gives you \( A^{-1} \).
   - By understanding this process, one can express any invertible matrix as a product of elementary matrices.

The text emphasizes memorizing this procedure and being meticulous in applying row operations to avoid mistakes.

The text describes a process of finding the inverse of a matrix using elementary row operations, which are represented as multiplication by elementary matrices. The steps include:

1. **Elementary Operations**: Start with an identity matrix and perform operations such as multiplying rows by constants and subtracting one row from another.

2. **Constructing Elementary Matrices**: Each operation corresponds to an elementary matrix (E1, E2, etc.). These matrices are used to transform the original matrix into its inverse.

3. **Inverse Calculation**: By applying these transformations sequentially, you can find the inverse of the original matrix. The operations are equivalent to multiplying by these elementary matrices in sequence.

4. **Reversibility**: Multiplying the inverse matrices together will return you to the original matrix, confirming the correctness of the inversion process.

5. **Key Statements**: There are three crucial statements or rules related to these operations that should be memorized for exams.

6. **Practical Application**: The method involves systematically applying row operations and keeping track of them using elementary matrices, which allows solving problems involving matrix inverses efficiently.

The text emphasizes understanding and memorizing the fundamental operations involved in this process, as well as constructing the inverse through systematic application of these principles.

The text provides an explanation of how a matrix \( A \) can be expressed as a product of the inverses of elementary matrices. An elementary matrix is obtained by performing one of three types of elementary row operations on an identity matrix.

### Key Points:

1. **Elementary Matrices and Inverses:**
   - Elementary matrices are derived from the identity matrix through elementary row operations.
   - Matrix \( A \) can be expressed as a product of the inverses of these elementary matrices, not directly as their product.

2. **Row Operations:**
   - The text illustrates how to perform row operations on an example 2x2 matrix to achieve the identity matrix.
   - Each operation corresponds to forming an elementary matrix.

3. **Steps Demonstrated:**
   - **First Operation:** Multiply the first row by \( \frac{1}{3} \) (or divide by 3).
     - This yields the first elementary matrix.
   - **Second Operation:** Multiply the first row by 6 and subtract it from the second row to create a leading one in the second row.
     - This results in the second elementary matrix.
   - **Third Operation:** Multiply the second row by \(-1\) to make the bottom left element zero.
     - This creates the third elementary matrix.

4. **Result:**
   - By performing these operations, you transform \( A \) into the identity matrix, and the product of the inverses of the corresponding elementary matrices gives \( A^{-1} \).
   - The text emphasizes memorizing these steps and understanding how they relate to finding the inverse of a matrix.

5. **Advice:**
   - It suggests using positive multipliers during row operations for clarity and accuracy.
   - Care is advised to avoid mistakes, especially when subtracting rows.

This explanation underscores the importance of understanding elementary matrices and their role in expressing and manipulating matrix inverses through row operations.

The text describes a process of transforming a matrix \( A \) into its inverse using elementary row operations and constructing corresponding elementary matrices. Here's a summary:

1. **Elementary Row Operations**: The author explains performing specific row operations on a 2x2 identity matrix, resulting in changes that help form the inverse of a given matrix.

2. **Matrix Transformation**:
   - Start with an identity matrix \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - Multiply and subtract rows to transform it into another matrix, which becomes part of the process to derive the inverse.
   - The operations result in a new row configuration: \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ -\frac{2}{3} & -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

3. **Elementary Matrices**: Each step corresponds to an elementary matrix (\( E_1, E_2, E_3 \)), which represents the row operation performed. These matrices can be multiplied together to find the inverse of \( A \).

4. **Inverse Calculation**:
   - Multiply the sequence of elementary matrices by the original matrix \( A \) to obtain \( A^{-1} \).
   - Alternatively, multiply the inverse of these matrices in reverse order to return to the original matrix \( A \).

5. **Learning and Memorization**: The text emphasizes memorizing key operations and equations necessary for constructing inverses during exams.

6. **Constructing Inverses**:
   - Start with a given matrix \( A \) and apply row operations to transform it into its inverse.
   - Track each step using corresponding elementary matrices, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.

Overall, the text provides a methodical approach to finding matrix inverses through systematic row operations and understanding how these translate into elementary matrices.
