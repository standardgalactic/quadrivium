Myxedema coma, or hypothyroid coma, is a critical condition associated with severe untreated hypothyroidism. It presents as a medical emergency with high mortality rates (20-30%) and typically affects elderly females during winter months. Contributing factors include hypothermia, acute coronary events, cerebrovascular incidents, trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infections.

Diagnosis relies on recognizing symptoms of hypothyroidism in a hypothermic patient, including hypoventilation and bradycardia preceding cardiorespiratory failure. Notably, typical infection signs like fever are absent due to masking by the condition. Laboratory tests reveal low thyroid hormones, elevated TSH (though not always), anemia, hyponatremia, high LDH and CK levels, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and hypercholesterolemia, along with arterial blood gas showing hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.

Management involves ICU admission for fluid and electrolyte management, addressing hypoglycemia and hypercalcemia, and providing ventilatory and cardiac support. Hydrocortisone is administered intravenously to maintain stress hormone levels as the metabolic rate increases with thyroid hormone therapy. Intravenous T3 may be used cautiously in elderly patients due to rapid action and potential fluctuations; a starting dose of 10-20 mcg every four hours on the first day, gradually decreasing over two days, is recommended.

As the patient improves, oral thyroxine (50-100 mcg per day) can commence. Collecting body fluid samples for microbial analysis and performing a chest X-ray are also essential steps in management.
