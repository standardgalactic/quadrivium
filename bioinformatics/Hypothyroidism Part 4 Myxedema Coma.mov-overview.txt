Myxedema coma, or hypothyroid coma, is a critical condition associated with severe untreated hypothyroidism. It presents as a medical emergency with high mortality rates (20-30%) and typically affects elderly females during winter months. Contributing factors include hypothermia, acute coronary events, cerebrovascular incidents, trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infections.

Diagnosis relies on recognizing symptoms of hypothyroidism in a hypothermic patient, including hypoventilation and bradycardia preceding cardiorespiratory failure. Notably, typical infection signs like fever are absent due to masking by the condition. Laboratory tests reveal low thyroid hormones, elevated TSH (though not always), anemia, hyponatremia, high LDH and CK levels, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and hypercholesterolemia, along with arterial blood gas showing hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.

Management involves ICU admission for fluid and electrolyte management, addressing hypoglycemia and hypercalcemia, and providing ventilatory and cardiac support. Hydrocortisone is administered intravenously to maintain stress hormone levels as the metabolic rate increases with thyroid hormone therapy. Intravenous T3 may be used cautiously in elderly patients due to rapid action and potential fluctuations; a starting dose of 10-20 mcg every four hours on the first day, gradually decreasing over two days, is recommended.

As the patient improves, oral thyroxine (50-100 mcg per day) can commence. Collecting body fluid samples for microbial analysis and performing a chest X-ray are also essential steps in management.

Myxedema coma, also known as hypothyroid coma, is a critical medical emergency linked to severe, often untreated hypothyroidism. It predominantly affects elderly females and tends to occur in winter months. The condition can lead to high mortality rates, ranging from 20-30%. Symptoms include profound hypothermia, hypoventilation, bradycardia, and potential cardiorespiratory failure. Additionally, paralytic ileus and megacolon are major concerns, while typical infection indicators like fever and tachycardia may be absent due to masking by the hypothyroid state.

Diagnosis is primarily clinical but supported by lab findings of low thyroid hormone levels and elevated TSH (though sometimes not significantly if an underlying serious disease or infection is present). Other lab results might show anemia, hyponatremia, elevated LDH and CBK levels, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Arterial blood gas analysis often reveals hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.

Management involves intensive care unit (ICU) admission with fluid and electrolyte replacement, hypoglycemia and hypercalcemia management, and necessary ventilatory and cardiac support. Hydrocortisone is administered to maintain stress hormone levels, and microbial cultures are collected for analysis. The cornerstone of treatment is thyroid hormone administration; low-dose intravenous T3 (10-20mcg every 4 hours) can be used initially, especially in the elderly, with doses decreasing over two days as the patient improves. Oral thyroxine therapy can follow at 50-100mcg per day.

Overall, rapid and careful management is crucial to improve outcomes in myxedema coma patients.
