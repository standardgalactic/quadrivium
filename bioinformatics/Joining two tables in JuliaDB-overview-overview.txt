This text is a tutorial on performing different types of table joins using JuliaDB, focusing on descriptive statistics and grouping. It explains how to create two sample tables: a "left table" with columns for ID (primary key) and age, and a "right table" with IDs from 1 to 15, CRP values generated from a rounded normal distribution, and the same primary key, ID.

The tutorial covers four main types of joins:

1. **Inner Join**: Combines rows from both tables based on matching primary keys, excluding any rows without corresponding entries in both tables (e.g., IDs 11-15).

2. **Left Join**: Retains all rows from the "left table" and matches them with the "right table," inserting `NA` values for unmatched entries.

3. **Outer Join**: Includes all rows from both tables, filling in `NA` where there is no match between the tables.

4. **Anti Join**: Returns only those rows from the "right table" that do not have corresponding matches in the "left table."

The tutorial emphasizes experimenting with these joins to fully grasp their behavior and highlights JuliaDB's strength in data manipulation based on primary keys.
