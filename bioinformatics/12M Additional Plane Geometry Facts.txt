Okay, we'll carry on with these shortcuts. The shortcut theme is just done plain geometry and I want to connect it to matrix equations.
I want to connect the two. Now in matrix equations we had all sorts of things. We had a homogenous system, an homogenous system can either only have the trivial solution or infinitely many and all of those.
If you can't remember, then you can work out what we said at that time. Because look at it now. Remember we have our linear system. We have a solution to our linear system. For the solution we needed the inverse of A.
And remember the inverse of a matrix is 1 over the determinant of the matrix times the adjoint of the matrix. So if you give me a square matrix, I can always get the adjoint.
It's just a whole thing we go through. The matrix of cofactors, the matrix of minors, and then we get the transpose of that, we get the adjoint matrix.
But the determinant, if the determinant is zero, if the determinant is zero, I don't have the inverse. And does it necessarily mean if I don't have the inverse that I can never get an answer?
No, that is not automatically so. First of all, just think of reasons why this could be zero.
Well, remember we said if we had a whole column of zeros, or we had a whole row of zeros, then the determinant would be zero.
Or if one row was just a scalar multiple of, all the rows were just a scalar multiples of each other.
Remember, then they would all be parallel planes and we would also get zero. And we have no solution.
But it's not to say that if the determinant is zero, I have no solutions whatsoever.
Now remember, we've just been dealing with these three planes.
But let's, instead of them being 10, 5, and 0, let's just make them equal to 0, 0, 0.
Think in your head, what does that mean as far as the planes are concerned?
They'll each have a normal vector, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, and 1, 1, 2 would be their normals.
But that zero means they all pass, think about, we've just done plain geometry, that means they all pass through the origin.
If you have a system like this, in matrix equation, we call that the homogeneous, homogeneous, homogeneous, homogeneous set of equations.
They all pass through the origin.
That's what we're trying to say, or in linear and matrix equations, we said that they all equal 0.
Now that, think about yourselves, think to yourself, what can happen with planes?
Because now the question's going to come in the exam, what are the possibilities for the solutions of a homogeneous or homogeneous system?
Or a homogeneous set of linear equations?
You can't remember, was it infinitely many?
Was it one specific solution?
Was it no solutions whatsoever?
Think, just think about it.
What are the possibilities?
They all pass through, they all pass through the origin.
So obviously, the origin must be a solution.
If I plug in x equals 0, y equals 0, and z equals 0, I solve all three of those.
So one answer would be 0, 0, 0.
So it's either going to have one specific solution, but that is a very special type of single solution,
and it's called the trivial solution.
In mathematic speak, that is the trivial solution.
Trivial solution.
That is one possibility.
What is the other possibility?
Well, once again, they can all pass through the origin.
They all have to pass through the origin, but look at it.
Once again, it's difficult for me to draw planes three-dimensionally, but they could all pass right through in a single line,
sorry, and that contains the origin.
That contains the origin.
So there will be infinitely many solutions, because if I look at it from the top, say for instance like that,
if I could peek at it from the top, they all pass through the origin as well.
They have to because it's an homogeneous system, but they will all connect in this very same line.
So that's either the trivial solution or infinitely many solutions.
Infinitely many solutions.
Many solutions.
Or infinitely many solutions.
And if you just think about the normal to all of these,
if I look at it from the top, the normal to this one would be there,
the normal to that one would be there,
the normal of that one would be there.
Okay, the normal to them all have got to be perpendicular.
And if that all comes out of the origin,
and they've all got to be perpendicular to this line upon which we are looking now,
they are all in the same plane.
Because they're all perpendicular to this very same line,
and that makes them what we call co-planar.
The normals to these three planes are said to be co-planar,
and if they're co-planar, we have these infinitely many solutions.
Or indeed we have this trivial solution.
This trivial solution.
And so which one is which?
Well, this one is for, I've got to get this right,
this one is for, one of them will be for a determinant equals zero,
and one of them will be for a determinant not equaling zero.
I just want to look it up so I have exactly the same thing.
We'll write out a nice algorithm for how these work in the next video.
Good, yes, our algorithm, we have a homogeneous system.
In other words, all equals zero, all passed through to zero.
We're going to have two possibilities.
We need to have the determinant equals, does not equal zero.
And remember, the question that we asked was,
if the determinant was zero, does it always mean we don't have a solution?
And we said no.
Okay, if it doesn't equal zero for a homogeneous system,
that means we have the trivial solution.
We only have the trivial solution, zero, zero, zero.
If we took the determinant of this three by three matrix,
remember that would have been four, zero, one, two, one, zero, and one, one, two.
If I took the determinant of that,
let's take the determinant of that along the,
let's do along row, column one.
So I'm going to, or let's do it along row.
There's a zero in the first row,
so certainly that would be a good row to take.
So if I take the determinant,
it's going to be four times two times zero,
so that's a two.
I remember that there's no negative for my second one
because remember, the matrix are minus.
We're going to do a negative there.
And then there'll be a positive one.
We'll have a positive one.
And so for this one,
we're going to have two minus one is one.
So we're going to have eight plus one plus one that equals nine.
So this was not going to be zero.
So the only solution we're going to have for this
is the trivial solution.
But if we had one that was zero,
that means looking from the top,
we're going to have coplanar,
we're going to have coplanar normals.
In other words,
they're going to meet all three of them in this long line
and we're going to have infinitely many solutions.
So certainly this we can work out
from just all the stuff we've learned now
from plane geometry,
we can now go back to the first few chapters
on linear algebra on the matrix equations.
And we can remember this,
statements that we had first of all to learn by heart.
But now through drawing plane geometry in our mind,
we can sort of start to work out
what these two types of solutions will be
for a homogeneous system.
In the next section,
we'll just look at a more general system
where this is not all zeros.
It's not a homogeneous system.
Now, if we just move on again
to the general set of linear equations,
in other words,
the right-hand side can be anything,
not zero, zero, zero.
Then again, we're going to have
a determinant not equal to zero
and a determinant equal to zero.
The determinant not equal to zero
is actually the same as up here.
Here we had a trivial solution,
zero, zero, zero,
which was one type of a unique solution.
And again, we will find a unique solution.
If the determinant does equal zero,
here we had infinitely many solutions.
Again, we're going to have infinitely many solutions.
But there's another possibility
where there are no solutions at all.
Remember when we looked from the top
of two were parallel
and there was the other one
or there was something like this
looking from the top
that there was no,
there were these one, two, three
parallel lines of intersections.
So those two intersected there,
those two there,
those two there.
So they can either then be no solutions
or if you do find one,
you'll know there'll be multiple other ones
because there's either no
or infinitely many.
If the determinant doesn't equal zero,
well then there is this one
specific unique solution.
If you look from the top,
there's one, there's one
and then there was this other plane.
So there's a line,
there's a plane
and they connected at one specific spot
a unique solution
and the determinant would not have been zero.
Could we still hear now
shortcuts?
Shortcuts,
it's not shortcuts always,
it's just equating things
that we've learned before
and to each other
so we understand
where this whole course
in linear algebra
how it all fits in together.
Why are we learning
such disparate things?
No, they all fit together.
And now that we've looked at planes,
let's just move on to lines
a little bit
and before we looked at lines,
this is the intersection
of two planes
and because we had
a third unknown
because we made a matrix
of that,
a augmented matrix,
we did a graph elimination on it
and then we just let z equals t.
This is another way
that other textbooks
might look at it.
I have a line
and I need an equation
for that line
and we know we're going to go
for parametric equations
meaning we're going to describe
x, y, and z
in terms of another variable t.
And another way to look at it
is here's this line
that goes up to infinity,
down to infinity
and imagine it's not flat
on the board,
it actually makes an angle
to the board.
Okay, what I'm going to see
this line is
it's as a dot
that slowly moves along.
So it starts at a time
negative infinity
and it slowly moves
and time
tending to infinity
it will be
you know,
very far away
on that side.
And it's just a particle,
imagine it's just a particle
that moves along this line
and it moves
at constant velocity.
In other words,
if I take some points
on this,
if I have point p0
and I said that
this was say
at time t equals 0
but remember
time goes to
negative infinity
on that side
and I call this
time equals 1
now that might be
1 year,
1 second,
1 minute
that at half
of this distance
that would be
t equals 1 half
because I'm moving
at constant velocity,
nicely constant velocity.
And what if I had
two points on this line?
Point p0 there
is negative 1, 2, 2
and point p1, 1, 3, 1
that means we can
take any other point
on the point
x, y, and z
and some books
will write it as
x of t,
y of t,
and z of t
which would probably
be the more correct
way of looking
at that point p.
Now if I draw
vector p1,
p0, p1
and I draw vector
p0, p
and because this
t is linear
as it moves
in other words
equidistances
are equal amounts
of time apart
I think it's clear
to see
that that vector
will mean
t times that vector.
The length
is my vector
p0, p1
and my vector
p0, p.
So one is this
going to be
t times longer
than the other one.
They are exactly
the same in direction
it's just the magnitude
that differs
and it's just
going to be t.
If t was a half
then p0, p
would have been
a half times
p0, p
so p was there
then
and this was a half
it would have just
been a half
of this length
if that equals
two
it would be
p0, p
would be twice
p0, p1
it would be
just twice that.
Now let's look
at p0, p
that's easy
for us to get
p0, p
that is
one minus
negative one
that's
two
comma
one
comma
what did I
sort of see
if I wrote down
these equations
negative one
two
two
one
three
negative
one
I thought
there was
something there
one
three
negative
one
so
minus
one
minus
two
is
negative
three
so
that is
going to
be there
and now
on this
side
we're going
to have
t times
p0, p1
oh
I made this
the wrong way
around
didn't I
I hope
someone caught
that
was screaming
and shouting
p0, p
so p
is going
to be
x, y, z
or as I said
better written
there
x of t
y of t
z of t
but let's
write it
in this
form
so
p
0, p
was going
to be
x plus
one
we're going
to have
an x
plus one
and we're
going to
have a
y minus
two
and we're
going to
have a
z minus
two
and z
minus
two
and that
was going
to equal
t times
p0, p1
and now
we have
one minus
negative
one
is two
that is
a one
and that
is a
negative
three
so
what are
we going
to have
if we
multiply
that
let's
keep
this
x
plus
one
and
y
minus
two
and
z
minus
two
that's
on that
side
and on
this
side
we're going
to have
a
2t
and a
1t
and a
negative
3t
okay
so
what
will
we have
we will
have
x
plus
one
x
plus
one
equals
2t
we'll
have
y
minus
2
equals
t
and we'll
have
z
minus
2
equals
negative
3t
or the
better way
that we
know about
is that
x
is going
to equal
negative
1
plus
2t
y
is going
to equal
2
plus
t
and
z
is going
to equal
2
minus
3t
and I hope
you can see
that negative
infinity
is smaller
than t
is smaller
than infinity
so that's
another way
instead of
looking at
the intersection
of two planes
if I have
two points
I can also
get the
equation
of a plane
by thinking
about it
as a
moving point
moving at
constant velocity
along a
certain track
and that
straight
movement
that straight
velocity
forms
a line
and through
that I can
also get
the equation
of
the equation
of a
line
by
the
viewer
to
go
on
and
say
there
are
many
どう
gar
lo
can
get
the
velocity
the
die
on
