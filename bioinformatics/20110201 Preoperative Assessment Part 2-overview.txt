The text discusses guidelines for assessing post-operative mortality and mobility risk, with an emphasis on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system. It highlights the importance of understanding pre-operative cardiac risks, which are often related to supply-demand issues rather than thrombotic states.

Key points include:
- ASA Scoring: Ranges from ASA1 (healthy patient) to ASA5 (patient not expected to survive 24 hours without surgery), with a suffix for emergency procedures.
- Pre-operative Cardiac Risk: Affects up to one-third of surgical patients. Factors include the type and location of surgery, especially those involving major fluid shifts or areas like thoracic and abdominal regions.
- Risk Assessment Tools: Outdated tools like Goldman's are rarely used now; Eagles and Lee systems are preferred for cardiac risk stratification.
- History and Examination: Essential components include patient age, history of myocardial infarction (especially timing), hypertension control, and physical exams with ECGs. Echoing is recommended for patients with significant cardiovascular issues or recent events.

Overall, the text emphasizes a comprehensive approach to pre-operative assessment using both clinical evaluations and stratification systems to predict and manage post-operative risks effectively.
