The text discusses guidelines for assessing post-operative mortality and mobility risk, with an emphasis on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system. It highlights the importance of understanding pre-operative cardiac risks, which are often related to supply-demand issues rather than thrombotic states.

Key points include:
- ASA Scoring: Ranges from ASA1 (healthy patient) to ASA5 (patient not expected to survive 24 hours without surgery), with a suffix for emergency procedures.
- Pre-operative Cardiac Risk: Affects up to one-third of surgical patients. Factors include the type and location of surgery, especially those involving major fluid shifts or areas like thoracic and abdominal regions.
- Risk Assessment Tools: Outdated tools like Goldman's are rarely used now; Eagles and Lee systems are preferred for cardiac risk stratification.
- History and Examination: Essential components include patient age, history of myocardial infarction (especially timing), hypertension control, and physical exams with ECGs. Echoing is recommended for patients with significant cardiovascular issues or recent events.

Overall, the text emphasizes a comprehensive approach to pre-operative assessment using both clinical evaluations and stratification systems to predict and manage post-operative risks effectively.

The text discusses key considerations for assessing post-operative risks related to patient health and surgery type. Here are the main points:

1. **Scoring Systems**: 
   - The ASA score (American Society of Anesthesiologists) is highlighted as an important tool for predicting post-op mortality, mobility, and especially pulmonary risk.
     - ASA1: Normal healthy patient
     - ASA2: Patient with mild systemic disease
     - ASA3: Patient with severe but not incapacitating systemic disease
     - ASA4: Patient with incapacitating systemic disease posing a constant threat to life
     - ASA5: Moribund patient unlikely to survive 24 hours, with an emergency procedure indicated by a suffix

2. **Cardiac Risk Assessment**:
   - Pre-operative cardiac risk is significant due to supply-demand issues rather than thrombotic states.
   - Up to one-third of surgical patients may have significant coronary artery disease and cardiovascular risks.
   - High-risk factors include known peripheral vascular disease, the type and location of surgery (e.g., vascular, thoracic, upper abdominal, major orthopedic procedures).

3. **Risk Stratification Tools**:
   - Older tools like Goldman's risk stratification are now less commonly used.
   - Current tools mentioned include Eagles and Lee for cardiac risk assessment.

4. **Basic Assessments**:
   - A thorough history is crucial for assessing risks.
   - Important factors include the patientâ€™s age, hypertension control (including medication use), history of myocardial infarction (MI) timing affects reinfarction risk post-op), and New York Heart Association classification for cardiovascular risk.

5. **Physical Examination**:
   - A normal cardiovascular examination and ECG are standard.
   - Echocardiograms may be considered for patients with significant cardiovascular disease, previous surgeries, or recent cardiovascular events.
   - Physical exams should also check for signs of peripheral vascular disease and lung conditions.

Overall, the text emphasizes a comprehensive approach to pre-operative risk assessment, focusing on both patient health status and surgical factors.
