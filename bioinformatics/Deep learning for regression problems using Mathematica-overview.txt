To perform the tasks you outlined for preparing your dataset for training and testing with a deep neural network, here's a step-by-step guide based on what you mentioned:

### Step 1: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

First, we need to split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming `data` is your dataset in a NumPy array format with shape (n_samples, n_features + 1)
np.random.seed(123)  # Setting random seed for reproducibility

n = data.shape[0]
split_index = int(np.floor(0.8 * n))

# Shuffle the data
shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(n)
data_shuffled = data[shuffled_indices]

# Split into training and testing sets
data_train = data_shuffled[:split_index]
data_test = data_shuffled[split_index:]

print("Training set size:", data_train.shape)
print("Testing set size:", data_test.shape)
```

### Step 2: Separate Features and Target Variables

Next, separate the features (X) from the target variable (y) for both training and testing datasets.

```python
# Assuming the last column is the target variable
x_train = data_train[:, :-1]
y_train = data_train[:, -1]

x_test = data_test[:, :-1]
y_test = data_test[:, -1]

print("x_train shape:", x_train.shape)
print("y_train shape:", y_train.shape)
print("x_test shape:", x_test.shape)
print("y_test shape:", y_test.shape)
```

### Step 3: Standardize the Features

Standardizing involves transforming your features so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Initialize the scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit on training data and transform both training and testing data
x_train_standardized = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test_standardized = scaler.transform(x_test)

# Verify that the transformation was successful
print("Mean of x_train_standardized:", np.mean(x_train_standardized, axis=0))
print("Standard deviation of x_train_standardized:", np.std(x_train_standardized, axis=0))
```

### Explanation

- **Splitting Data**: We shuffle the data to ensure randomness and then split it into 80% training and 20% testing.
  
- **Separating Features and Target**: We assume that the last column in your dataset is the target variable.

- **Standardizing**: This step involves calculating the mean and standard deviation of each feature in the training set, subtracting the mean from each feature value, and dividing by the standard deviation. This transformation ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.

By following these steps, you've prepared your dataset for training a deep neural network effectively.

To evaluate the performance of your regression model, you can compare the predicted values with the actual values in your test set. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create Predictions**: Use your trained neural network to predict the output for your standardized test data.

   ```python
   # Assuming 'trained_net' is your trained model and 'x_test_standardized' is your test data
   predicted = trained_net(x_test_standardized)
   ```

2. **Pair Actual and Predicted Values**: Create pairs of actual and predicted values to facilitate evaluation.

   ```python
   predictions_pairs = [[y_test[i], predict[i]] for i in range(len(y_test))]
   ```

3. **Evaluate Performance**: Calculate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
   import numpy as np

   # Convert predicted and y_test to arrays if they are not already
   actual_values = np.array(y_test)
   predicted_values = np.array(predicted)

   # Calculate MAE
   mae = mean_absolute_error(actual_values, predicted_values)
   print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")

   # Calculate RMSE
   rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(actual_values, predicted_values))
   print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse}")
   ```

4. **Visualize Results**: Plot actual vs. predicted values to visually inspect the model's performance.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   plt.scatter(actual_values, predicted_values, alpha=0.5)
   plt.plot([actual_values.min(), actual_values.max()], [actual_values.min(), actual_values.max()], 'k--', lw=4)
   plt.xlabel('Actual Values')
   plt.ylabel('Predicted Values')
   plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Values')
   plt.show()
   ```

These steps will help you understand how well your model is performing and where it might need improvement.

The text outlines how to create and evaluate a deep neural network using custom data for regression analysis, specifically focusing on the Wolfram Language (Mathematica). Here's a summary:

1. **Data Preparation**: The author uses a dataset with actual and predicted values to plot an "actual vs. predicted" scatter plot, enhancing it with axis labels and aspect ratio settings.

2. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated by taking the absolute differences between actual and predicted pairs, providing a measure of prediction accuracy.
   - A second approach involves subtracting predicted from actual values, negating predictions to facilitate subtraction using paired lists, resulting in an MAE of 0.62 for the dataset.

3. **Using Wolfram Language**:
   - The text describes utilizing the `predict` function within Mathematica, which automates machine learning processes.
   - It highlights how this function chooses algorithms like random forest and neural networks to optimize prediction quality, adjusting parameters such as performance goals automatically.
   - A comparison plot using a random forest model shows a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.52.

4. **Customization**: Users can specify certain methods, such as neural networks, allowing Mathematica to determine the structure without manual intervention.

5. **Conclusion**: The Wolfram Language is praised for its automation and effectiveness in machine learning tasks, with additional resources available through Udemy courses.

The text emphasizes ease of use and automation features of Mathematica in handling regression problems using deep neural networks.
