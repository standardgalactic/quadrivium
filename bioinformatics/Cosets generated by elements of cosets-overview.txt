The text discusses the concept of cosets in group theory, focusing on how left and right cosets are generated using elements from within a subgroup. Here's a summary:

1. **Coset Generation**: We start by considering a group \( G \) and its subgroup \( H \). Elements \( A \) can either belong to \( H \) or not.

2. **Left Cosets**: When an element \( A \) (not in \( H \)) is used, it generates a left coset of the form \( A + H \), which includes all elements formed by adding \( A \) to each element in \( H \).

3. **Coset Property**: The text explores what happens when you take an arbitrary element from a generated left coset and use it to create another coset with \( H \). The key theorem stated is that this new coset will still be one of the original left cosets, although its order might differ.

4. **Proof Using Associativity**: By using associativity, it's shown that taking an element from a coset and forming a new coset with \( H \) results in just another rearrangement of the elements already present in \( H \). Thus, the new coset is identical to one of the original left cosets.

5. **Visual and Theoretical Insight**: The argument holds similarly for right cosets, where multiplication replaces addition. Visually and theoretically, this reinforces that any element from a coset used to generate another with \( H \) results in no new elements outside those already present in \( H \).

6. **Conclusion**: This property of cosets is surprising yet fundamental, serving as an important concept in understanding the structure of groups and their subgroups.

The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing that generating a coset from any element within it doesn't produce new elements but merely reorders existing ones.
