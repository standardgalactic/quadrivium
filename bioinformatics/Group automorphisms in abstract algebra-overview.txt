The text provides an overview of group theory with a focus on group isomorphisms and automorphisms. Here's a summary:

1. **Group Automorphism**: An automorphism is an isomorphism from a group to itself, meaning it's a bijective homomorphism that preserves the group structure.

2. **Automorphism Properties**:
   - **Identity Mapping**: The identity mapping on a group is always an automorphism.
   - **Composition**: If two mappings are automorphisms of a group, their composition will also be an automorphism.
   - **Inverse Mapping**: The inverse of an automorphism is also an automorphism.

3. **Automorphism as a Group**:
   - The set of all automorphisms of a group forms a group itself under the operation of function composition.
   - This group of automorphisms is a subgroup of the symmetric group on the set, consisting of all possible permutations of the group's elements.

4. **Bijective Nature**: Automorphisms are bijective, ensuring that every element in the domain has a unique image and preimage in the codomain.

5. **Isomorphism Property**: For an automorphism \( F \), it holds that \( F(G_1 \cdot G_2) = F(G_1) \cdot F(G_2) \) for any elements \( G_1, G_2 \) of the group.

The text ends by mentioning a future example to illustrate these concepts further.
