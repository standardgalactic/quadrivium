The text expands on Archimedes' principle by emphasizing two key points for solving problems:

1. The magnitude of the buoyant force is independent of the fluid's density.
2. As fluid density increases, the volume of fluid displaced decreases because the mass of the displaced fluid equals the mass of the object.

Therefore, denser fluids require less volume to be displaced in order to balance the mass of an immersed object. These insights are crucial for understanding buoyancy and displacement.
