The text expands on Archimedes' principle by emphasizing two key points for solving problems:

1. The magnitude of the buoyant force is independent of the fluid's density.
2. As fluid density increases, the volume of fluid displaced decreases because the mass of the displaced fluid equals the mass of the object.

Therefore, denser fluids require less volume to be displaced in order to balance the mass of an immersed object. These insights are crucial for understanding buoyancy and displacement.

The text adds important considerations to Archimedes' principle for solving problems. It emphasizes two key points: 

1. The magnitude of the buoyant force is independent of the density of the fluid, meaning it remains constant regardless of how dense or less dense the fluid is.

2. As the density of the fluid increases, the volume of fluid displaced decreases. This is because a denser fluid requires a smaller volume to equal the mass of the object being submerged. However, the mass of the displaced fluid always equals the mass of the object. 

Understanding these facts helps in accurately applying Archimedes' principle by recognizing that while buoyant force remains constant, the volume displaced varies with fluid density.
