Here's a summary of the provided text:

1. **Parametric Equations for a Line**: To represent a line in 3D space, you need:
   - A point on the line, \( P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0) \).
   - A direction vector \( \mathbf{v} = (a, b, c) \).

   The parametric equations for the line are:
   \[
   x = x_0 + ta, \quad y = y_0 + tb, \quad z = z_0 + tc
   \]
   where \( t \) is a scalar parameter.

2. **Example**: For a line through \( (1, 2, -3) \) and parallel to the vector \( (4, 5, -7) \):
   \[
   x = 1 + 4t, \quad y = 2 + 5t, \quad z = -3 - 7t
   \]

3. **Intersection with a Plane**: To find where this line intersects the \( xy \)-plane (\( z = 0 \)):
   - Solve for \( t \) using \( -1 + 8t = 0 \), yielding \( t = \frac{1}{8} \).
   - Substitute back to find intersection point: \( x = \frac{19}{8}, y = \frac{7}{2} \).

4. **Line from Plane Intersection**: When two planes intersect, their intersection is a line:
   - Convert plane equations into an augmented matrix.
   - Use Gauss elimination to solve for variables in terms of a parameter (e.g., \( z = t \)).
   - Express the line parametrically.

5. **Example Parametric Equations**:
   - Given \( y = -\frac{6}{11} - \frac{2}{11}t \) and \( z = t \), solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{26}{11} + \frac{16}{11}t
     \]
   - Resulting parametric equations:
     \[
     x = \frac{26}{11} + \frac{16}{11}t, \quad y = -\frac{6}{11} - \frac{2}{11}t, \quad z = t
     \]

The text outlines methods for deriving and using parametric equations to describe lines in 3D space, including intersections with planes.
