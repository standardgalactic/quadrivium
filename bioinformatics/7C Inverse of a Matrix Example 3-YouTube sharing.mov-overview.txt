The text discusses finding the inverse of a 2x2 square matrix \(A\). To determine if an inverse exists, it calculates the determinant using the formula \(\text{AD} - \text{BC}\). For this specific matrix, where elements are arranged as:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \]

the determinant is calculated as \(3 \times 0 - 0 \times 4 = 0\). Since the determinant is zero, matrix \(A\) does not have an inverse and is classified as singular. The text suggests a rule that if a matrix has an entire column of zeros, it will automatically be singular and thus lack an inverse.

The text discusses determining whether a given 2x2 square matrix \(A\) has an inverse. To find the determinant of matrix \(A\), we use the formula \(AD - BC\). For this specific matrix:

- \(A = 3\)
- \(B = 0\)
- \(C = 0\)
- \(D = 4\)

The determinant calculation is: \(3 \times 0 - 0 \times 4 = 0\).

Since the determinant is zero, matrix \(A\) does not have an inverse and is therefore singular. The text also suggests a rule: if a matrix has an entire column of zeros, it will automatically be singular.
