The text discusses finding the inverse of a 2x2 square matrix \(A\). To determine if an inverse exists, it calculates the determinant using the formula \(\text{AD} - \text{BC}\). For this specific matrix, where elements are arranged as:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \]

the determinant is calculated as \(3 \times 0 - 0 \times 4 = 0\). Since the determinant is zero, matrix \(A\) does not have an inverse and is classified as singular. The text suggests a rule that if a matrix has an entire column of zeros, it will automatically be singular and thus lack an inverse.
