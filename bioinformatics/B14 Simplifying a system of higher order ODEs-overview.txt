The text outlines a method for solving a system of second-order differential equations using numerical analysis. The approach involves converting these higher-order equations into a system of first-order equations, which is necessary before applying numerical techniques.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Identify Variables**: Start with two second-order equations involving variables \(x\), \(y\), and their derivatives (\(x''\), \(y''\)) along with an additional variable \(t\).

2. **Introduce New Variables**:
   - Define new variables to reduce the order of the system: let \(u = x'\) (the first derivative of \(x\)) and \(v = y'\) (the first derivative of \(y\)).
   
3. **Rewrite Equations**: 
   - Express the second-order derivatives in terms of these new variables:
     - Replace \(x''\) with \(u'\) and \(y''\) with \(v'\).
   - This transformation results in a system of four first-order equations.

4. **Set Up System**:
   - The transformed system involves functions dependent on \(t\), \(x\), \(y\), \(u\), and \(v\).
   - Example equation transformations include:
     - \(x'' = e^t + x' - 7x - y''\) becomes \(v' = e^t + u - 7x - v'\).
     - Simplify to get expressions like \(v' = g(t, x, y)\) and similar for other variables.

5. **Numerical Analysis**:
   - With the system now in first-order form, numerical methods can be applied to solve these equations.
   - The text hints at using Python for implementing these solutions but does not detail specific algorithms.

The overall goal is to simplify complex second-order differential systems into a more manageable form that is suitable for computational solving techniques.
