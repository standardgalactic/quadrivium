The text introduces basic techniques for solving ordinary first-order linear differential equations, focusing on models where the rate of change of a variable is proportional to the variable itself. This relationship is described mathematically as \( \frac{dy}{dt} = ky \), where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

There are two primary methods discussed for solving such equations:

1. **Homogeneous Linear Equations with an Integrating Factor**:
   - The equation \( y' = ky \) can be rearranged to standard form and solved using an integrating factor, which in this case is \( e^{-kt} \).
   - Multiplying through by the integrating factor simplifies the left side of the equation into a derivative, allowing easy integration.

2. **Separation of Variables**:
   - By separating variables, placing all terms involving \( y \) on one side and those involving \( t \) on the other, we integrate both sides.
   - The solution involves taking the natural logarithm of \( |y| \), leading to an exponential form: \( y = Ce^{kt} \), where \( C \) is a constant determined by initial conditions.

Both methods ultimately yield the same general solution, highlighting different approaches to solving linear differential equations. The constant \( C \) often relates to initial conditions, such as the value of \( y \) at time 0 (\( y_0 \)), and plays a significant role in problems involving growth or decay over time.
