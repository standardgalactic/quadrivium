The text introduces basic techniques for solving ordinary first-order linear differential equations, focusing on models where the rate of change of a variable is proportional to the variable itself. This relationship is described mathematically as \( \frac{dy}{dt} = ky \), where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

There are two primary methods discussed for solving such equations:

1. **Homogeneous Linear Equations with an Integrating Factor**:
   - The equation \( y' = ky \) can be rearranged to standard form and solved using an integrating factor, which in this case is \( e^{-kt} \).
   - Multiplying through by the integrating factor simplifies the left side of the equation into a derivative, allowing easy integration.

2. **Separation of Variables**:
   - By separating variables, placing all terms involving \( y \) on one side and those involving \( t \) on the other, we integrate both sides.
   - The solution involves taking the natural logarithm of \( |y| \), leading to an exponential form: \( y = Ce^{kt} \), where \( C \) is a constant determined by initial conditions.

Both methods ultimately yield the same general solution, highlighting different approaches to solving linear differential equations. The constant \( C \) often relates to initial conditions, such as the value of \( y \) at time 0 (\( y_0 \)), and plays a significant role in problems involving growth or decay over time.

The text introduces linear models in differential equations, focusing on how these models describe the rate of change of a variable proportional to the variable itself. In such cases, this proportionality is expressed using a constant \( k \), leading to a first-order linear differential equation. The text outlines two methods for solving such an equation:

1. **Homogeneous Linear Equations with Integrating Factor:**
   - Rearrange the equation into standard form.
   - Use an integrating factor (e.g., \( e^{-kt} \)) to transform it into an easily integrable form.
   - Integrate both sides to find the solution.

2. **Separation of Variables:**
   - Separate the variables, placing all terms involving \( y \) on one side and those with \( t \) on the other.
   - Integrate each side independently.
   - Solve for \( y \), introducing a constant that depends on initial conditions (often denoted as \( y_0 \)).

Both methods lead to an exponential solution of the form \( y = C e^{kt} \), where \( C \) is determined by initial conditions. These techniques are applicable in contexts such as growth and decay models, with examples provided to clarify their use. The text emphasizes that understanding these foundational concepts is crucial for solving a variety of real-world problems modeled by linear differential equations.
