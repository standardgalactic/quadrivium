The text discusses the concept of integrating functions in calculus, specifically focusing on the integration of products of functions. Initially, it reviews how simple functions were integrated previously by finding their antiderivatives. The discussion then shifts to more complex scenarios where we need to integrate products of functions, such as \( x \times \cos(x) \).

To handle these cases, a product rule for integration is introduced, derived using the differentiation product rule. This rule states that the integral of a product of two functions can be expressed in terms of one function times the antiderivative of the other and minus the integral of the derivative of the first function times the antiderivative of the second.

An example is provided to illustrate this: integrating \( x \times \cos(x) \). By strategically choosing which part of the product becomes \( f \) (and thus whose derivative is simpler), and which part becomes \( g' \) (and thus has a manageable antiderivative), the process simplifies. In this case, setting \( f = x \) and \( g' = \cos(x) \) leads to straightforward calculations: the derivative of \( x \) is 1, and the antiderivative of \( \cos(x) \) is \( \sin(x) \). The integration results in:

\[
x \sin(x) - \int \sin(x) \, dx = x \sin(x) + \cos(x) + C
\]

This demonstrates how to apply the derived product rule for integration. The text emphasizes choosing parts of the function strategically to simplify calculations when integrating products of functions.

The text discusses the concept of integrating more complex functions beyond simple antiderivatives. Initially, it introduces the indefinite integral of \(x^2\) and illustrates integration with respect to subtraction of two functions: \(f(x) = x^3\) and \(g(x) = \frac{2}{x}\).

It then addresses the challenge of integrating products of functions, using \(x \cdot \cos(x)\) as an example. The text explains that a product rule for integration is needed, akin to the product rule in differentiation. By applying differentiation principles, it derives a formula to integrate such products:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

The method involves identifying \(u\) and \(dv\), differentiating and integrating them respectively, then rearranging terms.

For the example \(x \cdot \cos(x)\):

- Choose \(u = x\) (so \(du = 1 \, dx\))
- Choose \(dv = \cos(x) \, dx\) (so \(v = \sin(x)\))

Substitute into the integration formula:

\[
\int x \cdot \cos(x) \, dx = x \cdot \sin(x) - \int \sin(x) \, dx
\]

Simplify to find:

\[
x \cdot \sin(x) + \cos(x) + C
\]

This approach uses strategic choices for \(u\) and \(dv\) to simplify calculations. The text concludes with a note on naming conventions but appears somewhat jumbled in its final sentences.
