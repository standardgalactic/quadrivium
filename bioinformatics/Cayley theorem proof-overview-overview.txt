Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the provided text on demonstrating Cayley's Theorem:

### Key Concepts

1. **Bijective Mapping**:
   - A function is **injective (one-to-one)** if it maps distinct elements in its domain to distinct elements in its codomain.
   - It is **surjective (onto)** if every element in the codomain has a pre-image in the domain.
   - A function is **bijective** when it is both injective and surjective.

### Cayley's Theorem

- **Statement**: Every group \( G \) can be represented as a permutation group, meaning there exists an isomorphism between any group and some subgroup of a symmetric group acting on the set \( G \).

### Proof Construction

1. **Group Definition**:
   - Consider a finite group \( G = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n\} \) with identity element \( e \).

2. **Permutation Mapping**:
   - For each \( g_i \in G \), define a function (permutation) \( \phi_{g_i}: G \to G \) by \(\phi_{g_i}(x) = g_i \cdot x\).
   
3. **Verify Permutations**:
   - **Injectivity**: If \( \phi_{g_i}(x_1) = \phi_{g_i}(x_2) \), then \( x_1 = x_2 \) due to the group's cancellation law.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any element \( y \in G \), there exists an \( x = g_i^{-1} \cdot y \) such that \( \phi_{g_i}(x) = y \).

4. **Define Mapping**:
   - Create a function \( \Phi: G \to S_G \) (where \( S_G \) is the symmetric group on \( G \)) by setting \(\Phi(g_i) = \phi_{g_i}\).

5. **Prove Isomorphism**:
   - **Homomorphism**: Show that for any \( g_i, g_j \in G \), \(\Phi(g_i \cdot g_j) = \Phi(g_i) \circ \Phi(g_j)\).
   - **Injectivity**: If \(\Phi(g_i) = \Phi(g_j)\), then \( g_i = g_j\).
   - **Surjectivity onto Image**: The image of \( \Phi \) is a subgroup of \( S_G \).

### Conclusion

The function \( \Phi \) demonstrates an isomorphism between the group \( G \) and a subgroup of \( S_G \), thus proving Cayley's Theorem. This shows that any group can be represented as a permutation group, illustrating its abstract algebraic properties through permutations.
