The text introduces the concept of equivalence relations, which are binary relations that possess three specific properties: reflexivity (each element relates to itself), symmetry (if one element relates to another, then the second relates back to the first), and transitivity (if an element relates to a second, and the second relates to a third, then the first relates directly to the third). When a relation meets all these criteria, it is termed an equivalence relation.

The text uses parity as an illustrative example. It examines integers (excluding zero) and defines a relation based on having "the same parity," meaning elements are either both even or both odd. This relation naturally divides the set of integers into two subsets: one containing all even numbers and another containing all odd numbers. These subsets collectively exhaust the original set, while their intersection is emptyâ€”highlighting that no number can be both even and odd simultaneously.

The text also hints at checking reflexivity for this parity relation, suggesting further exploration of how equivalence relations manifest in practical examples like parity.

The text describes the concept of an equivalence relation in mathematics, using a specific example involving subsets. An equivalence relation is defined as being reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

1. **Symmetric**: The text confirms symmetry by showing that if one element pair (e.g., 2 and 4) belongs to a subset, then the reverse pair (e.g., 4 and 2) also belongs to it.
   
2. **Transitive**: It illustrates transitivity with an example: If 2 is related to 4 and 4 is related to 6, then 2 must be related to 6.

3. **Equivalence Relation and Partitioning**: The text emphasizes that an equivalence relation partitions the original set into distinct subsets where each subset contains elements that are equivalent to each other. This partition has two main properties:
   - The union of all these subsets equals the original set.
   - The intersection between any two different subsets is empty.

The key takeaway is that an equivalence relation not only organizes a set but also creates unique partitions based on equivalence among elements, ensuring both coverage and exclusivity within those partitions.
