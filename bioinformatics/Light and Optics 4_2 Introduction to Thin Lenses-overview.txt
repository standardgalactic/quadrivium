The text provides an overview of how to solve three optical problems involving lenses, specifically focusing on determining image distance (\(s_i\)) and magnification (m) for both converging (convex) and diverging (concave) lenses. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **First Problem - Converging Lens:**
   - Given: Focal length (\(f\)) = 12 cm, Object distance (\(s_0\)) = 20 cm, Object height (\(y_0\)) = 4 cm.
   - Analysis: Using the lens formula \(\frac{1}{s_0} + \frac{1}{s_i} = \frac{1}{f}\), solve for \(s_i\). 
   - Result: The image distance \(s_i\) is calculated to be 30 cm, indicating a real and inverted image. Image height (\(y_i\)) is found to be -6 cm (inverted).

2. **Second Problem - Converging Lens:**
   - Given: Focal length = 7.5 cm, Object distance = 5 cm.
   - Analysis: Again using the lens formula, calculate \(s_i\) and magnification \(m\).
   - Result: The image is virtual (since \(s_i\) is negative), upright, and enlarged with an image distance of -15 cm.

3. **Third Problem - Diverging Lens:**
   - Given: Focal length = -18 cm, Object distance = 27 cm.
   - Analysis: Use the lens formula to find \(s_i\).
   - Result: The image is virtual (since \(s_i\) is negative), upright, and diminished with an image distance of -10.8 cm.

4. **Additional Problem - Converging Lens Placement:**
   - Scenario: A lens with a focal length of 20 cm is placed 30 cm in front of a screen. Determine the object placement for the image to appear on the screen.
   - Analysis: Given \(s_i = 37\) cm, solve for \(s_0\).
   - Result: The object should be placed at 43.5 cm from the lens, resulting in an inverted real image on the screen.

The text emphasizes understanding the relationship between focal length, object distance, and image distance to predict the nature (real or virtual) and orientation (upright or inverted) of images formed by lenses.

The text discusses solving a problem related to optics, specifically finding the position and focal length of a converging thin lens. The lens is supposed to project an image magnified four times onto a screen 10 meters away from the object. It clarifies that the magnification (M) is given as four but does not specify if it's upright or inverted. 

To solve this, the problem uses the lens formula and the concept of magnification. The text suggests that because a real image is formed by a converging lens, and since it is magnified four times, the image must be inverted (indicating negative magnification). This leads to the equation:

\[ M = -\frac{S_I}{S_0} \]

Given \( M = -4 \) and \( S_0 + S_I = 10 \), substituting into the formula gives:

\[ -4 = \frac{S_I}{S_0} \]
\[ S_I = -4S_0 \]

Substituting \( S_I = 10 - S_0 \) into the equation results in:

\[ -4S_0 = 10 - S_0 \]
\[ 3S_0 = 10 \]
\[ S_0 = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \, \text{meters} \]

Thus, \( S_I = 10 - S_0 = 6.67 \, \text{meters} \).

The text then uses these values to find the focal length using the lens formula:

\[ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_I} \]

Substituting \( S_0 = 3.33 \) meters and \( S_I = 6.67 \) meters, we can calculate the focal length \( f \). The text ends by noting that these calculations confirm the lens properties needed to achieve the specified magnification and image placement.

The text explains a mathematical relationship where 8 is equated to \( \frac{1}{F} \). By setting up an equation, it shows that \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) leads to \( \frac{1}{F} = \frac{5}{8} \), thus implying that \( F = \frac{8}{5} \) centimeters. The context emphasizes the importance of understanding and making sense of three specific figures involved in this calculation for a coherent narrative. Despite any complexities, the conclusion is presented as straightforward.
