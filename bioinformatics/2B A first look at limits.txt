so in this first lecture let's have a proper look at what a limit is we're going to start
with a polynomial a nice normal polynomial that you must be so familiar with and we're
going to see what happens to the y value as the x value reaches or tends to reach a certain spot
now i warn you much of the time i'm going to make use of the t variable and not x i'm just
replacing x with t because in the life sciences most of the time we're interested in what happens
over time not what happens over space so i'm not interested in an x y but in a ty so as time goes on
what happens to some y value so just watch out for that so we're going to start with a normal normal
easy polynomial and then i'm going to change things ever so slightly just change that polynomial
and then you'll really see what the limit is all about and so here we have a graph that i'm going
to use to explain to you what a limit is it seems as if this graph starts at 0.0 and then goes all the
way up it's actually one that you know pretty well let's write it down we're going to say it's the f of
t equals t squared now you might be used to x's there y equals x squared but in the life sciences
we are very interested in what happens over time so instead of the x-axis here we're really just going
to have in this direction time increasing this might be day one day two minute one minute two
minute three we're usually interested in time so let's have a look y equals t squared and we've got
this very special point here we're letting t obviously equal two here at the bottom as if x was
two but let's write it there so we have that the f of two well that just means we're just going to
replace two in there so that'll be two squared and two squared is four and lo and behold the value there
is four what we're interested in when we talk about a limit though is something quite different
now you might have seen this already this is how we write it we want to know the limit
what does that mean well it means look down here on the let's call it the old x axis the t axis down
here the time axis we can come from this side and we can get closer and closer and closer to two
but we can also come from this side and get closer and closer and closer to two in other words we can
have 1.9 1.99 1.999 and on this side we can have 2.00001 2.00001 etc closer and closer and closer
until we get try at least and get to two but we don't and let's just finish this so the limit is t
approaches 2 of the f of t so we just want to know what happens to the f of t as t approaches 2
very importantly you've got to get this concept down t never reaches 2 when we talk about limits
when we talk about limits t never reaches 2 so whatever this value is whether it's x or t
we say the limit as t approaches 2 from the left hand side let's do that right now the left hand
side and the right hand side as it approaches 2 is a certain value reached is a certain solution to f of
t reached in other words as i get closer and closer to 2 and lo and behold we see here as we get closer
and closer to 2 we can going to get arbitrarily closer and closer here to 4 we're going to get to 4
so as i go up here as i move up here up here up here i'm going to get to 4 as i move down down down
here i'm going to get to 4 so i have that the limit as t approaches 2 is an actual value it is equal
4 as t approaches 2 it is 4 the answer is going to be 4 so there is a definite value that is reached
as we get arbitrarily closer and closer to 2 so this is what we would call a limit
so here we have a tabular view of what we just tried to attempt here here we have our t values
and you see we started 1.9 then 1.99 1.999 1.9999 and we get closer and closer to 2 we never get to 2
that's the limit the limit as t approaches 2 we get closer and closer to it but we never actually
get there and then from the other side you see we are very close to 2 and we move further away and
on this side we have the f of t remember that was just t squared so you can see what's uh what's
happening here so from this side we approach we approaching 2 and from this side we approaching 2
and look at this very very clearly 3.6 3.9999999999 and then 4.00 very clearly here we are trying to
reach the value 4 so there's this definite solution to this problem the limit as t approaches 2 equals an
exact value as we get closer and closer to we get closer and closer to 4 and we can actually get to 4 so
there is a solution to this limit so this was one way of doing it you can always just plug in values
closer and closer and closer and see well am i getting towards a certain value and clearly we're
getting closer and closer to 4 on this side so an absolute value is reached so this is the first way
that we can solve a limit as we can start plugging in values that get closer and closer and closer
now here we have a new function f of t so let's just do this we're still increasing time in this
direction so as t carries on we've got this new function t squared minus 4 over t minus 2
now i want to draw your attention to the fact that there's some problem here
what happens to the limit let's write that down as t approaches 2 of the f of t
well in the denominator if i would plug in 2 i have 2 minus 2 and that gives me 0 and i cannot have 0 in a
denominator it is not a defined function if we divide by 0 so what happens now on this axis remember
we're approaching 2 from this side we're approaching 2 from this side what is happening right here what is
happening at that point well it's still a straight line i've drawn it for you here and you can do some
algebra on this you'll see why that is so and perhaps we'll do that later but there's definitely
a hole here the function is not defined at t equals 2 but very clearly and this is how limits work
it's one of the beauties of limits as we get closer and closer to this side from that side and as we get
closer and closer clearly we are reaching the value 4 so even though 2 is not defined and here it's not
a problem for us remember we said in a limit t approaches 2 we never actually have to get to 2 and
in fact we don't but as we go from the left hand side as we go from the right hand side and these values
so we get closer and closer to this undefined point we do get a value of 4 so even though 2 is not
defined in this function we are still going to say that the limit as t approaches 2 of the f of t in
this instance is still 4 even though the function is not defined at t equals 2 but you can clearly see
this graph is trying to reach the value of 4 and really is trying to get there so even though there's
a gaping hole there definitely is not a 2 comma 4 here the value the function is not defined there
the graph is still absolutely trying to get to 4 and therefore this limit this function does have
a limit as t approaches 2 and indeed if you did what we did before by the table that we had as you
plug in values closer and closer and closer to 2 closer and closer and closer to 2 from both sides
you'll see that indeed the solution is trying to get to 4 it does arbitrarily get closer and closer to 4
so the limit here definitely still exists now to bring the point home let's have a look at what's
happening here we have a piecewise defined function you'll be familiar with this and the f of t can take
one of two forms it's still t squared minus 4 over t minus 2 if t does not equal 2 but 3 if t equals 2
now the function is defined at t equals 2 and here we have it it takes on the value of 3 now i ask you
what is the limit as t approaches 2 as t approaches 2 remember it never ever is 2 of the f of t now what is
it going to be is it going to be is it going to be 4 because clearly it's going to clearly it's still
trying to reach this value of 4 as we get closer and closer to 2 here on the t axis but at 2 it really
is 3 there's my value there if i go along here it's 3 on the y axis so what is the answer here
as i said with the lecture before just think about it if i were to plug in in a little table values
closer and closer and closer to 2 the answer is going to get closer and closer to 4 it is of no
consequence that the function is defined and equal to 3 or whatever else that constant might be even if
it is defined there and there clearly is a solution there the solution at t equals 2 is not the limit
it is what the graph is trying to reach what value it is trying to reach as we get closer and closer to
this limit and clearly here the answer is still 4 plug it again we've done a plug it into a a table
and get values closer and closer to 2 the answer is going to get closer and closer to 4 so clearly this
limit even though the solution to f of t is 3 at t equals 2 as t approaches to the solution to the limit
is still going to be 4
