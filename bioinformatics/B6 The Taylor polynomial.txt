Now we've just very quickly looked at the derivative just as a reminder of what you
learned at school or maybe another university or college courses. The one
thing that you might not be that familiar with or you might not have seen
before is the Taylor expansion or Taylor polynomial where we're going to
represent a function for instance e to the power x or the sine of x or the
cosine of x by a series a polynomial and this is exactly this almost exactly this
this can be written as almost exactly this and this can be written as almost
exactly this and how do we get to that and I think I'll make another video or two
on this just to bring home the point again we're not going to show where this
comes from you'll just have to at least for now if you if you would like try to
memorize that so f of x is going to be almost equal to this new polynomial which
is the sum of this expression and k starts at zero and goes to n and the
larger we make n or as n approaches infinity these two will be almost will be
exactly the same almost exactly the same so this is f to this power k but
remember it's not a power because we put these little brackets so that denotes the
the derivative so if k is zero that's just the f of c if that k is one it means f prime of c
of x with x equals c if k is two that's f prime prime or the second derivative
so that's why it's in those brackets so that does not denote power it denotes
what order of derivative we're taking multiplied by x minus c to the power k divided by remember
what this is that's factorial that is factorial so let's just have a look at the f of x here
now the c is important because c can take any value the most common one is at c equals zero
and then it's not called the taylor polynomial but some people call it a maclaurin series a maclaurin
expansion maclaurin polynomial this is a special case where x equals c and you know might ask what
is this all about is this all about it is about being able to write a function which is so difficult
that it's impossible to get it's especially it's it's it's integral we're area under the curve between
two points and if we write it down as a stale expansion if we write write it down like this it
might be easier for us to do some mathematical procedures on it if we have this polynomial
now these of course are quite easy and we'll see why we still stick to them though why they might
might become useful i mean we know what the derivatives of these are but what we are trying
to say and as i said i'll make another video with with curves or two is that if you have the curve of e to
the power x i can in some vicinity of x equals c so say for instance at zero i can write this series
which at least in that vicinity of that specific x value x equals c whatever i choose if i choose it to
be zero at x equals zero in that vicinity these two that and that will be very close to each other in
other words if i do any mathematics around that point on that curve i'm going to get the same answer
because this will approximate that and the longer i carry this on the more and more and more these two
lines will be curves of these two functions will be on top of each other and any mathematics i do in
that region as i said will give me yield almost the correct answer so this is e to the power x ends up as
one plus x plus x squared over two plus you'll note that this is two factorial this is one factorial
and this is zero factorial remember zero factorial is just one now here we have the taylor expansion of
sine of x it's x minus x cubed over six plus x to the power five over 120 minus so i see this positive
negative positive negative and i have x to the power one three five seven and yeah i have three factorial
five factorial seven factorial in the denominator and for cosine i have again the positive negative
positive negative but i go from x to the power zero to x squared to x to the power four to x to the power
six and that is over zero factorial two factorial four factorial six factorial and that's an easy way to
remember if you just have to write this out but let's have e to the power x let's see where it comes from
and how do we construct this so let's construct let's construct that first i'm going to have the
f of x equals e to the power x if i have now remember this is a zero there so i'm not taking
any derivative now if i take one derivative of x in other words f prime of x well that just stays e to
the power x if i have if if i have a two there of x in other words prime prime second derivative that
stays e to the power x if i have a three there of x that stays e to the power x if i have a four there
it stays that e to the power x but let's now choose a point c and let's make it easy on ourselves let's
choose x or us equals c equals zero c equals zero so that's just going to be x that's just going to be
x there and we're going to take the f of the f of zero at point zero in other words our c here is zero
x equals zero so that's e to the power x is now zero so that's one so the f of one equals also e to the
power zero that's just one they all stay one one one one it never changes it makes it quite easy
at least as e to the power x is concerned and successively of this what are we going to get
we're going to get x to the power zero we're going to get x to the power zero x to the power one
x to the power two x to the power three x to the power four x to the power five x to the power six
and you can see you can see where this comes from x to the power 0 x to the power one x to the power two
x to the power 3. Remember this is summation. So I'm going to take k equals 0. That's my first term.
And what is that going to end up? That is that 1 times x to the power 0 which is this 1 divided
by 0 factorial and 0 factorial remember is 1. So that's 1 times 1 over 1 and that's why I get my 1.
Now I grow k by 1 so that becomes goes from 0 to 1. It grows in positive integers of 1.
If that is 1 I'm getting the f prime of c. f prime of c which is just 1 again times x to the power 1
which is just x divided by 1. So 1 times x divided by 1 leaves me just with x. If I go to 2 I'll have
f prime prime of 0 which is just 1. I'll have, I haven't written these in lines, so that's times
the x squared divided by 2 factorial. And so I carry on this summation and that is how I would get that.
And now you can try for yourself to get to work out the sine of x and the cosine of x and see
that you get exactly the same answer.
