The text outlines an approach to deriving a formula for curvature (\(\kappa\)) using vector calculus. Here's a summary:

1. **Cross Product Approach**: The derivation begins by considering the cross product of two vectors related to acceleration:
   - The first vector involves the derivative \( \frac{d^2t}{dt^2} \), representing a component of acceleration.
   - The second vector is \( t \times \frac{ds}{dt} \), which simplifies using properties of unit vectors and cross products.

2. **Simplification**: 
   - The text notes that the cross product of two identical vectors results in zero, allowing for simplification.
   - It uses known relationships like \( t \times n = b \) (where \( b \) is a unit vector), to further simplify expressions.

3. **Magnitude and Curvature**:
   - By focusing on magnitudes, the expression reduces to involve only scalar quantities.
   - The formula for curvature (\(\kappa\)) emerges as:
     \[
     \kappa = \frac{\|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|^3}
     \]
   - Here, \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) is the position vector, and \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}''(t) \) are its first and second derivatives with respect to time.

4. **Conclusion**: The derived formula for curvature is elegant and practical, requiring only the position vector and its first two derivatives. This approach highlights the beauty of using vector calculus to express geometric properties like curvature in a concise manner.
