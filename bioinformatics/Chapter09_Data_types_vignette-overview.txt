In the lecture, different data types are introduced through two classification systems: categorical vs. numerical data and discrete vs. continuous data types. Understanding these distinctions is crucial because they influence the choice of statistical analyses that can be performed on the data. Categorical data represents categories or groups, while numerical data consists of numbers. Discrete data refers to countable values, whereas continuous data includes measurements that can take any value within a range. Recognizing these data types helps in selecting appropriate methods for analysis and interpretation.
