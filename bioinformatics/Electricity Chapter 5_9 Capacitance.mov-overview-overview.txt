The text explains Gauss's law as it applies to a dielectric material within a capacitor setup. It highlights the effect of a dielectric on enclosed charge calculations by introducing induced charges.

In an example scenario with a parallel plate capacitor:
- The initial configuration (without dielectric) has plates with a 115 cm² area and a 0.0124 cm gap, charged to 85.5 V.
- The capacitance \( C_0 \) is calculated using the formula ε₀ * (area/distance), resulting in approximately 8.21 picofarads.
- The charge on the plates without dielectric is about 702 picocoulombs, determined by \( Q = CV \).

Electric field analysis shows:
- Without a dielectric, the electric field is roughly 6.90 kV/m.
- With a partial insertion of a dielectric (κ = 2.61), the electric field inside reduces to approximately 2.64 kV/m.

The presence of the dielectric affects the potential across the plates:
- The new potential is calculated by considering contributions from both gaps with and without dielectrics, resulting in about 52.3 volts.

Overall, the text emphasizes how dielectrics influence capacitance, electric fields, and voltage in capacitors.
