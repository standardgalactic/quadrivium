The passage you provided appears to be an explanation or solution to problems related to radioactive decay, specifically focusing on carbon-14 dating. Here’s a concise breakdown of the key points and calculations involved:

1. **Radioactive Decay Basics**:
   - Radioactive decay involves the transformation of unstable atomic nuclei into more stable ones over time.
   - The decay rate is characterized by the half-life (\(t_{1/2}\)), which is the time required for half of a radioactive sample to decay.

2. **Carbon-14 Dating**:
   - Carbon-14 dating is used to determine the age of formerly living objects based on the remaining amount of carbon-14, a naturally occurring radioactive isotope.
   - Living organisms maintain a constant level of carbon-14 due to its continuous incorporation from the atmosphere.
   - Upon death, the intake stops, and the existing carbon-14 decays at a known rate.

3. **Decay Constant (\(\lambda\))**:
   - The decay constant \(\lambda\) is related to the half-life by the formula: 
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}
     \]

4. **Activity and Calculation**:
   - Activity is defined as the number of decays per unit time.
   - For a given sample, its current activity (\(A\)) compared to its original activity when it was part of a living organism (\(A_0\)), can be used to determine its age using the formula:
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(A_0/A)}{\lambda}
     \]

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - In your example, a specimen contains 9.2 grams of carbon with an activity of 1.6 disintegrations per second.
   - The baseline activity for living organisms is given as 0.23 disintegrations per gram per second.
   - For 9.2 grams, the expected activity if it were part of a living organism would be:
     \[
     A_0 = 9.2 \times 0.23 = 2.116 \text{ disintegrations/second}
     \]
   - The age (\(t\)) of the specimen can then be calculated as:
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(2.116 / 1.6)}{5.7 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{s}^{-1}}
     \]
   - Converting the decay constant from seconds to years (\(1 \text{ year} \approx 3.156 \times 10^7 \text{ s}\)), you find:
     \[
     t \approx 2300 \text{ years}
     \]

This process illustrates how carbon-14 dating is used to estimate the age of archaeological samples, assuming a constant initial activity over recent millennia. The key step involves adjusting for the size of the sample to ensure that current measurements are comparable to historical baselines.

The passage you provided discusses several key concepts related to radioactive decay and carbon dating. Let’s break down these concepts step-by-step:

### Radioactive Decay and Half-Life

1. **Radioactive Decay**: 
   - This is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation.
   - The activity (decay rate) of a sample is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei present.

2. **Half-Life (\(t_{1/2}\))**:
   - The time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay.
   - It's related to the decay constant (\(\lambda\)) by the formula: 
     \[
     t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{\lambda}
     \]

3. **Decay Constant (\(\lambda\))**:
   - A probability per unit time that a given nucleus will decay.
   - Related to the ratio of current amount (\(n\)) to initial amount (\(n_0\)): 
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{n}{n_0}\right) = -\lambda t
     \]

### Carbon Dating

1. **Carbon-14 (\(^{14}C\))**:
   - A radioactive isotope of carbon used in dating organic materials.
   - It decays into nitrogen-14 over time, and its half-life is about 5730 years.

2. **Activity**:
   - The activity of a sample tells us how many decay events occur per second.
   - For carbon dating, the activity is compared to what it would have been when the organism was alive.

3. **Calculating Age**:
   - Given: Current activity (\(A\)) and initial activity (\(A_0\)).
   - Use the formula for age (\(t\)):
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(A_0/A)}{\lambda}
     \]
   - The decay constant \(\lambda\) can be found using:
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}
     \]

### Example Problem

In the example provided:

- A specimen has 9.2 grams of carbon with an activity of 1.6 decays per second.
- Initially, it is assumed that 1 gram of carbon has an activity of 0.23 decays per second (for living organisms).
- To find the age:
  - Calculate the initial expected activity for 9.2 grams: \(9.2 \times 0.23 = 2.116\) decays/second.
  - Use the formula for age with the current and initial activities:
    \[
    t = \frac{\ln(2.116/1.6)}{\lambda}
    \]
  - Substitute \(\lambda\) using the half-life of carbon-14 (\(5730\) years):
    \[
    \lambda = \frac{0.693}{5730}
    \]
  - Solve for \(t\), which gives an age of approximately 2300 years.

### Key Takeaway

The passage emphasizes understanding the relationship between activity, decay constant, and half-life to determine the age of a specimen using carbon dating. The calculation involves converting known activities to comparable conditions (e.g., same mass) and applying logarithmic relationships to solve for time.
