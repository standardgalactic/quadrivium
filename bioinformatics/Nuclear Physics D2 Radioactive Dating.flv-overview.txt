The passage you provided appears to be an explanation or solution to problems related to radioactive decay, specifically focusing on carbon-14 dating. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown of the key points and calculations involved:

1. **Radioactive Decay Basics**:
   - Radioactive decay involves the transformation of unstable atomic nuclei into more stable ones over time.
   - The decay rate is characterized by the half-life (\(t_{1/2}\)), which is the time required for half of a radioactive sample to decay.

2. **Carbon-14 Dating**:
   - Carbon-14 dating is used to determine the age of formerly living objects based on the remaining amount of carbon-14, a naturally occurring radioactive isotope.
   - Living organisms maintain a constant level of carbon-14 due to its continuous incorporation from the atmosphere.
   - Upon death, the intake stops, and the existing carbon-14 decays at a known rate.

3. **Decay Constant (\(\lambda\))**:
   - The decay constant \(\lambda\) is related to the half-life by the formula: 
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}
     \]

4. **Activity and Calculation**:
   - Activity is defined as the number of decays per unit time.
   - For a given sample, its current activity (\(A\)) compared to its original activity when it was part of a living organism (\(A_0\)), can be used to determine its age using the formula:
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(A_0/A)}{\lambda}
     \]

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - In your example, a specimen contains 9.2 grams of carbon with an activity of 1.6 disintegrations per second.
   - The baseline activity for living organisms is given as 0.23 disintegrations per gram per second.
   - For 9.2 grams, the expected activity if it were part of a living organism would be:
     \[
     A_0 = 9.2 \times 0.23 = 2.116 \text{ disintegrations/second}
     \]
   - The age (\(t\)) of the specimen can then be calculated as:
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(2.116 / 1.6)}{5.7 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{s}^{-1}}
     \]
   - Converting the decay constant from seconds to years (\(1 \text{ year} \approx 3.156 \times 10^7 \text{ s}\)), you find:
     \[
     t \approx 2300 \text{ years}
     \]

This process illustrates how carbon-14 dating is used to estimate the age of archaeological samples, assuming a constant initial activity over recent millennia. The key step involves adjusting for the size of the sample to ensure that current measurements are comparable to historical baselines.
