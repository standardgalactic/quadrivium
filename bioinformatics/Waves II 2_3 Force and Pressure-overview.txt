The text describes solving problems related to calculating radiation pressure exerted by high-power lasers on different surfaces.

1. **Problem with Reflective Plasma:**
   - A laser generates peak power of \(1.5 \times 10^9\) watts, focused on an area of one square millimeter (\(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\) square meters).
   - The plasma reflects all the light back.
   - Pressure is calculated using the formula \(P = \frac{2I}{c}\), where \(I\) (intensity) is power per unit area, and \(c\) is the speed of light.
   - This results in a pressure of approximately 10 megapascals.

2. **Problem with Absorptive Paper:**
   - A piece of paper with an area of two square centimeters (\(2.0 \times 10^{-4}\) square meters) totally absorbs light.
   - The intensity of the light is 10 watts per square meter.
   - Pressure for total absorption is given by \(P = \frac{I}{c}\).
   - This results in a pressure of approximately \(3.3 \times 10^{-8}\) pascals.

3. **Problem with Absorptive Surface from Point Source:**
   - A 500-watt point source emits isotropic radiation.
   - The surface is totally absorptive and located 1.5 meters away.
   - The text suggests calculating the radiation pressure at this distance, though it does not provide a complete solution.

The key takeaway is understanding how radiation pressure varies with reflection or absorption and the role of intensity in these calculations.

The text discusses how to calculate various properties of an electromagnetic wave traveling through a vacuum. The initial focus is on pressure, derived from power divided by area (4πr²), leading to an approximate value in Pascals.

Next, the scenario introduces an electromagnetic wave with specific characteristics: it has a wavelength of 3 meters and travels in the positive x-direction. Its electric field oscillates parallel to the y-axis at 300 volts per meter. Several properties are calculated:

1. **Frequency**: Using the formula \( f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light, the frequency is approximately \( 1.0 \times 10^8 \) hertz.

2. **Angular Frequency**: Calculated as \( 2\pi f \), resulting in about \( 6.3 \times 10^8 \) radians per second.

3. **Angular Wave Number**: Found using \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \), yielding approximately \( 2.1 \) inverse meters.

4. **Amplitude of the Magnetic Field**: Using the relationship \( B_m = \frac{E_m}{c} \), where \( E_m \) is the amplitude of the electric field, results in about \( 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \) tesla.

5. **Orientation of the Magnetic Field**: Since the wave travels in the x-direction and the electric field oscillates along the y-axis, the magnetic field's amplitude must be parallel to the z-axis.

The text discusses solving a physics problem related to electromagnetic waves and energy flow. The main focus is calculating the time-averaged rate of energy flow (intensity) in watts per square meter, which is found using the equation \( I = \frac{E^2}{2C\mu_0} \). Here, \( E \) is the electric field amplitude \( E_m \sin(x - T) \), and its squared average over time is used. The calculation yields an intensity of approximately 120 watts per square meter.

The problem then asks for the rate at which momentum is transferred to a totally absorbing surface with an area of 2 square meters, illuminated by the wave. Using the relationship \( F = I A / C \), where \( I \) is the intensity and \( A \) is the area, the momentum transfer rate (force) is calculated as approximately \( 8.0 \times 10^{-7} \) Newton.

Finally, the radiation pressure on the absorbing surface is determined using \( P = I / C \), resulting in a value of about \( 4.0 \times 10^{-7} \) Pascal. The calculations involve verifying arithmetic and ensuring that constants like the speed of light \( C \) and the permeability of free space \( \mu_0 \) are correctly applied.

The text discusses a complex problem that involves applying known equations to understand the rate of energy change, measured in joules per second per square meter. The challenge lies in calculating this rate and using the concept of time averaging, specifically involving the expression for sine squared where its average value can be considered as one-half. This approach is highlighted as potentially tricky compared to other parts of the problem-solving process.
