The text compares two DSLR cameras for video recording: an APS-C sensor camera with an articulated viewing screen on the left, offering versatile shooting angles; and a full-frame Canon 5D Mark II on the right, providing greater depth of field but lacking a hinge screen, which complicates self-recording. Both cameras support Canon EF lenses, ensuring high-quality video capture and excellent image quality.
