The text outlines a process for solving a differential equation by transforming and substituting variables. Here's a summary:

1. **Variable Substitution**: The problem involves changing the variable \( x \) to \( t \), where \( x = e^t \) or equivalently, \( t = \ln(x) \).

2. **Derivatives**: It calculates derivatives with respect to \( t \):
   - \( y' = \frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dt} \)
   - \( y'' = \frac{1}{x^2} \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} \)

3. **Equation Transformation**: The original differential equation is transformed using these derivatives:
   \[
   \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - 2\frac{dy}{dt} + y = t
   \]

4. **Homogeneous Solution**: Solve the homogeneous part:
   - Auxiliary equation: \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \) simplifies to \( (m-1)^2 = 0 \)
   - Solutions for \( m \): \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \)
   - Complementary solution: \( y_c = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t \)

5. **Particular Solution**: Assume a particular solution of the form \( y_p = a + bt \):
   - Derivatives: \( y_p' = b \), \( y_p'' = 0 \)
   - Substitute into the equation to find coefficients:
     - \( a - 2b = 0 \) and \( bt = t \)
     - Solving gives \( a = 2 \), \( b = 1 \)
   - Particular solution: \( y_p = 2 + t \)

6. **General Solution**: Combine complementary and particular solutions:
   \[
   y(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t + 2 + t
   \]

7. **Back to Original Variable**: Convert back to \( x \):
   - Replace \( t \) with \( \ln(x) \)
   - Final solution: 
     \[
     y(x) = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) + 2 + \ln(x)
     \]

The text concludes by emphasizing the method's utility in solving differential equations through substitution and transformation.

The text describes a mathematical expression involving several components:

1. A linear term.
2. A squared non-constant variable.
3. The second derivative minus the same non-constant variable raised to the power of one (i.e., itself).
4. The first derivative.

To apply specific methods discussed earlier, this expression needs to conform to a particular form that incorporates these elements: linear terms, squared variables, and both first and second derivatives adjusted by certain powers or operations on the variable.

The text outlines a process for solving a specific type of differential equation by transforming the variables and using substitution. Here's a summary:

1. **Variable Transformation**: The problem begins with a reminder to use substitutions where \( x = e^t \) or equivalently, \( t = \ln(x) \).

2. **Derivatives Transformation**:
   - First derivative: \( y' = \frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dt} \).
   - Second derivative: \( y'' = \frac{1}{x^2} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \frac{dy}{dt} \right) \).

3. **Substitution into Differential Equation**: These transformed derivatives are substituted back into the original differential equation, simplifying it to:
   \[
   \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - 2\frac{dy}{dt} + y = t
   \]

4. **Solving the Homogeneous Equation**:
   - The auxiliary equation derived from the homogeneous part is \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \), which factors to \( (m-1)^2 = 0 \).
   - This gives a repeated root \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \).

5. **Complementary Solution**: The complementary solution (\( y_c \)) is:
   \[
   y_c = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t
   \]

6. **Particular Solution**: Assume a particular solution \( y_p = a + bt \). Substituting this into the simplified equation gives conditions for \( a \) and \( b \), resulting in:
   - \( a - 2b = 0 \)
   - \( bt = t \)

   Solving these, we find \( b = 1 \) and \( a = 2 \). Thus, \( y_p = 2 + t \).

7. **General Solution**: Combining the complementary and particular solutions:
   \[
   y(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t + 2 + t
   \]

8. **Back-Substitution**: Convert back to \( x \) by substituting \( t = \ln(x) \):
   \[
   y(x) = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) + 2 + \ln(x)
   \]

This method uses substitution and solving of differential equations through transformed variables, providing a systematic approach to find solutions.

The text describes a mathematical function with specific characteristics. The function is linear, but also includes a squared non-constant variable term and its second derivative. Additionally, there's a term involving the first derivative and the non-constant variable raised to the power of one. These features suggest that the function must conform to a particular form to apply certain analytical methods or solutions previously studied. The presence of both derivatives indicates it might be related to differential equations or problems requiring specific solution techniques.
