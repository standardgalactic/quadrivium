The text outlines a process for solving a differential equation by transforming and substituting variables. Here's a summary:

1. **Variable Substitution**: The problem involves changing the variable \( x \) to \( t \), where \( x = e^t \) or equivalently, \( t = \ln(x) \).

2. **Derivatives**: It calculates derivatives with respect to \( t \):
   - \( y' = \frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dt} \)
   - \( y'' = \frac{1}{x^2} \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} \)

3. **Equation Transformation**: The original differential equation is transformed using these derivatives:
   \[
   \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - 2\frac{dy}{dt} + y = t
   \]

4. **Homogeneous Solution**: Solve the homogeneous part:
   - Auxiliary equation: \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \) simplifies to \( (m-1)^2 = 0 \)
   - Solutions for \( m \): \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \)
   - Complementary solution: \( y_c = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t \)

5. **Particular Solution**: Assume a particular solution of the form \( y_p = a + bt \):
   - Derivatives: \( y_p' = b \), \( y_p'' = 0 \)
   - Substitute into the equation to find coefficients:
     - \( a - 2b = 0 \) and \( bt = t \)
     - Solving gives \( a = 2 \), \( b = 1 \)
   - Particular solution: \( y_p = 2 + t \)

6. **General Solution**: Combine complementary and particular solutions:
   \[
   y(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t + 2 + t
   \]

7. **Back to Original Variable**: Convert back to \( x \):
   - Replace \( t \) with \( \ln(x) \)
   - Final solution: 
     \[
     y(x) = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) + 2 + \ln(x)
     \]

The text concludes by emphasizing the method's utility in solving differential equations through substitution and transformation.

The text describes a mathematical expression involving several components:

1. A linear term.
2. A squared non-constant variable.
3. The second derivative minus the same non-constant variable raised to the power of one (i.e., itself).
4. The first derivative.

To apply specific methods discussed earlier, this expression needs to conform to a particular form that incorporates these elements: linear terms, squared variables, and both first and second derivatives adjusted by certain powers or operations on the variable.
