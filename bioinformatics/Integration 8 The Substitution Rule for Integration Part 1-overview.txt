The text discusses using substitution in integration, particularly after introducing the product rule of integration. It provides an example: finding the indefinite integral of \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} \cdot 2x\) with respect to \(x\). The solution involves recognizing that \(x^2\) has a derivative \(2x\), suggesting substitution. By letting \(u = 1 + x^2\), we find that \(du = 2x \, dx\). Substituting these into the integral simplifies it to \(\int u^{1/2} \, du\), which integrates to \(\frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} + C\). Substituting back gives the final answer: \(\frac{2}{3}(1 + x^2)^{3/2} + C\).
