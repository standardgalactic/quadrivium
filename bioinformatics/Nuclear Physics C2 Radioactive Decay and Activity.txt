In this section we'll talk about radioactive decay and radioactivity.
And we'll start with this process or this theme of a half-life.
Now when you start with X amount of radioactive unstable nuclei and they're going to undergo decay,
which ones undergo decay? Well, that's a very important question in physics and we'll get to that later.
But what was noted, if you draw a graph over time, you'll note that there's a decrease like this.
And as time approaches infinity, the number of the original parent product tends to zero.
And what that graph indicated is that there was this concept of half-life.
In other words, if I start with 10 and the half-life is one day,
after one day I will have, well, let's start with something better.
10 is a bit difficult. Let's start with 12.
And then let's start with 16.
After one day I'll have 8 left.
After another day I won't have nothing left.
It's not a linear deduction.
It's not a linear deduction.
Okay, I'm going to have another half will disappear.
Now I'll have 4.
After another day I will have 2.
After another day I will have 1.
Okay, so that's the half-life.
Now, many radioactive elements have very, very different half-lives
from mere fractions of a second
till 10 to the power of 14 seconds.
So, absolutely very long half-lives.
Now, radon is what concerns many people
and as much as there is radon in the ground
in the form of gas
and through mechanisms that are not fully understood
it escapes and comes into your house
it gets settled, settles on dust particles
you inhale it
it undergoes radioactive decay
and those rays are indeed harmful to your lungs
to your body
So, anyway, so radon 222 has a half-life of 3.83 days
and we want to know if we start with 30 million
we start with 30 million radon 222 nuclei
with a half-life of 3.83 days
how many are we going to have left after a month
31 days
and now there are different ways of doing this problem
if I do remember I'll just put a reference in this video
to some of my videos on advanced calculus
that you can use to solve these problems
but let me just show you a simple way here
which has nothing to do with calculus
what we are going to do is just to see
we have 31 days
so we're just going to see how many of these half-lives
put into 31
so I'm going to take 31
and I'm going to divide it by the half-life
3.83 days
so that's in days and that's in days
so what I'm taking here is the number of days
that I have time divided by the half-life
that's what I'm doing there
and about 8.1 or something fits in there
when you do these problems just throw that away
so let's just take 8
it's going to go in there
and what you do is
you take 2 and you raise it to the power
your time divided by your half-life
so how many days you've got by
how many
how long the
how long the half-life is
just make sure that those two units are the same
so they cancel out
so this is going to be 2 to the power 8
2 to the power 8
and what you do is
if you want the number left at a certain time
at a certain time
that is going to equal
the number that you start off with
n0
divided by 2 to this power
t over t half
so in our case
this is going to be 2 to the power 8
2 to the power 8
because that was 31
divided by 3.83
and I just
rounded it off to 8
to the power 8 is 56
if I take 30 million
divided by 256
I am left with
in 31 days
I am left with
1.2 times 10 to the power 5
120,000
so I've gone from
30 million to
to 120,000
ok
without going into the calculus
as I said
although you can watch
my Cilison Advanced Calculus
which is also still in the making
let's start off by the graph
that we showed before
time versus how many there are
and certainly we showed
that that is
not a linear relationship
now if you take a substance
and over a certain time unit
you'll have the initial number of nuclei
and then the final
if you take the
that should be
that should be the other way around
if we take the initial number
and we subtract the final number from there
so it started with 10
now I have 9
I subtract those
and my answer would be 1
and if I divide that by the time unit
it's actually the absolute value of that
that is proportional to
the number that we started with
so that is the number of
decays per second
if my time unit is a second
and that is proportional to
how many we have at this
to start off with
and that gives us this
curved relationship
and what was found is
you can simply put it constantly
and that is negative lambda
negative because
we're getting less and less
as time goes on
and that lambda
is the decay constant
the decay constant
and we have these units
if we were
one
the book's called a disintegration
we think it's decay
one decay per second
is one becquerel
after a physicist
and then
Pierre-Marie Curie
and Arnold
then
there is also the unit of Curie
and that is 3.7 times 10
to the power 10 becquerel
that's the relationship
between these two
but the becquerel
is certainly
one decay per second
and this is where it
this is where it
comes from
and that leads us
to this equation
I see we've already
written it
so the number
that we have now
equals the number
that we start with
times Euler's number
Euler's number
e to the power
negative
the decay constant
times
times time
now let's just delve
a little bit deeper
I'm still not going to use
proper calculus
to do this
but what we showed
was
that the change
was proportional
to how many there are
so look at this
if I started
with my 16 again
and then I dropped
to 8
then to 4
then to 2
so on that first day
if I just took that
over one day
that would be
8 per day
I would have the change
16 minus 8
is 8
divided by one day
that is 8 per day
that would be 8 per day
but if I looked at this day
that will only be
a change of 2 per day
that will only be
a change of 2 per day
so it is proportional
to
where we are
at the moment
and as I said
that constant
of proportionality
is minus
this decay constant
minus this decay constant
now can we
get an equation
for that decay constant
most definitely
we can
if we start at this
let's do
let's go along
this step
exactly
1
half life
so I'm going to let
n
equals now
a half
of where we started
that means
t equals
t a half
so I'm going
one
half life
down the road
so I'm going to have
a half
n zero
equals
n zero
and I'm going to have
e to the power
negative
lambda
times t a half
times t a half
so I'm going to
lose this
what can I do
to get this
because I need this
out of the exponent
well I can take
the natural log
of both sides
I'm taking the
natural log
now that a half
and I'm taking
the natural log
of this
if I have
natural log
of
Euler's number
to the power
of something
that equals
just negative
that power
that gets rid
of this natural log
and then
this side
I have natural log
of 2 to the power
negative half
that negative half
can come outside
so I'm here
left with negative
the natural log
of 2
these negatives
will go
and if I want
to solve now
for this decay
constant
that is going
to be the natural
log of 2
divided by
the half
life
or the half
life is going
to be the natural
log of 2
divided by
the decay
constant
so that is
another equation
that we should
know
another equation
that we should
know
so if we revisit
our previous
problem
let's look at
that one
we started
with
how many
was that
30 million
3.0
times 10
to the power
of 7
was our
start
day
let's see
and we knew
our half
life
our t
half
life
of days
was 3.83
days
so let's
see from
that if we
can find
this decay
constant
we can take
the natural
log of 2
and we can
divide it
by
natural
log of 2
divided
by 3.83
days
that gives
me a decay
constant
of
I think
I did it
yes
1.81
inverse
days
if I converted
this to
seconds
let's just do
that 3.83
times 24
times 3600
that gave
me
I don't know
if I did it
anyway
if I then
divided
natural
log of 2
by that
number of
seconds
I get
a lambda
of
2.094
comes 10
to the
power
negative
6
inverse
seconds
inverse
seconds
so here
I just
used
3.83
days
converted
to seconds
and divided
it in there
and here
I just
used the
days
to divide
in there
so look
now what
happens
if I
look
on
if I
look
on day
1
remember
this
is
curie
or
becular
so if I
wanted
that
rate of
change
that
when I
started
off at
on day
0
that is
going to
be
negative
this
negative
this
times
the
number
of
seconds
because
remember
becquerels
is in
per
seconds
disintegrations
per
seconds
so if
I want
to express
it in
becquerels
I need
to put
this
in
the
inverse
seconds
so then
I'm going
to have
number
of
decays
per
second
so certainly
on day
0
when I
have
this
full
50
million
I'm
going
to
have
a
much
larger
rate
of
as
we
saw
here
a
much
larger
rate
of
change
okay
now
on day
31
what is
my rate
of
change
going
to be
well
first
of all
we need
to show
how many
there are
because
it is
proportional
to how
many
you are
starting
off
with
and on
day
one
day
0
you
started
with
30
million
and in
the
previous
example
I
think
there
was
only
120,000
that we
started
with
but let's
see
if we
can
use
this
equation
also
and
this
is
that
simpler
one
I
showed
you
before
if
we
can
get
to
120,000
wow
n
is going
to equal
n0
which was
our
30 million
and then
we're going
to multiply
it by
e to the
power
negative
now
as long
as these
two units
are the
same
so I
can
use
the
inverse
days
times
days
or
the
inverse
seconds
times
seconds
which
means
I
have
to
convert
31
days
into
seconds
as
well
now
remember
here
you've
got to
use
the
seconds
because
the
unit
that
you're
looking
for
is
per
second
here
I
can
use
either
days
or
seconds
ok
let's
use
days
because
it was
easier
I
had
how
many
0.1
negative
0.1
into
1
in
those
days
times
31
days
those
days
will
cancel
and I
can
just
do
that
and
lower
me
hold
you'll
also
find
1.2
times
10
to
5
that
is
left
ok
so
if
I
now
use
this
the
number
that
is
left
so
that
is
my
for
my
31
days
and
I
now
multiply
by
this
but
now
remember
I
must
use
the
per
seconds
because
I
want
becquerel
you'll
find
a
much
lower
you'll
indeed
find
a
much
lower
rate
I
think
the
answer
was
oh
I
don't
even
know
I
think
0.23
I
think
the
answer
was
0.23
becquerel
versus
on day
0
it was
something
like
63
it was
something
like
63
becquerel
so
certainly
you can
see that
the
number
of
disintegrations
per second
is much
larger
initially
and then
it just
gets
less and
less and
less
if it
stayed
the same
we would
have had
a
linear
relationship
but
we
don't
have
a
linear
relationship
