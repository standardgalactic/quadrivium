The text provides an overview of the physiology and diagnostic approaches related to the esophagus. The primary function of the esophagus is to transport food and drink from the mouth to the stomach through a combination of voluntary swallowing and reflexive peristaltic movements. Swallowing begins voluntarily, with the tongue pushing the bolus (food or liquid) into the throat while closing off the nasal passage via the soft palate. The epiglottis prevents aspiration by covering the larynx during swallowing.

The esophagus relies on high pressures in its upper region and negative pressure in the thoracic section to facilitate movement, employing primary peristaltic waves that propel the bolus at a certain speed towards the stomach, independent of body position. Secondary peristaltic waves occur abnormally due to obstruction or dilation, while tertiary waves are rare post-swelling occurrences.

Glandular structures in the esophagus produce mucus, aiding in lubrication and protection. The regulation of esophageal functions involves both sympathetic (via the perivertebral sympathetic chain) and parasympathetic (via the vagus nerve) nervous pathways.

For investigating esophageal function, three common diagnostic examinations are used: contrast swallow studies with barium for detailed imaging, water-soluble contrasts in cases of suspected perforation to avoid inflammation, and manometry to measure pressures within the esophagus during peristalsis. pH monitoring is employed specifically to assess gastroesophageal reflux disease by detecting acidity levels indicative of gastric content reflux into the esophagus.
