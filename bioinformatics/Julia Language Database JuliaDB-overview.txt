Certainly! Let's break down the process of creating and manipulating tables using Julia DB in a clear way:

### Creating Tables

#### Table One
- **Data Preparation**: You start by preparing two lists: `1 to 10` for IDs and another list with random integers from a normal distribution for ages.
  
- **Table Creation**:
  ```julia
  table1 = Table([
      collect(1:10), 
      randn(Int, 10) .* 5 + 30  # Example of generating age values around mean 30 with some standard deviation
    ], names=[:ID, :Age])
  ```
  
- **Explanation**: This creates a table `table1` with columns named `ID` and `Age`. The first column is IDs from 1 to 10, and the second column contains randomly generated ages.

#### Table Two
- **Data Preparation**: Similar approach but with different data:
  - IDs: `1 to 10`
  - Group: Roman numerals as strings (e.g., "I", "II", ..., "X")
  - HB and WCC: Random values from normal distributions

- **Table Creation**:
  ```julia
  table2 = Table([
      collect(1:10), 
      ["I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX", "X"], 
      randn(Float64, 10) .* 4 + 16, 
      randn(Float64, 10) .* 3 + 12
    ], names=[:ID, :Group, :HB, :WCC], primary_key=:ID)
  ```
  
- **Explanation**: `table2` is created with columns `ID`, `Group`, `HB`, and `WCC`. The `primary_key` is set to `:ID`.

### Indexing and Extracting Data

#### Extract Specific Row
- To extract a specific row, use indexing:
  ```julia
  subject3 = table1[3, :]
  ```
  
- **Explanation**: This extracts the third row from `table1`, which corresponds to `subject3`.

#### Access Column Value for a Subject
- Use dot notation to access column values:
  ```julia
  age_of_subject3 = subject3.Age
  ```

#### Extract Specific Rows by Index List
- To extract specific rows, provide a list of row indices:
  ```julia
  selected_rows = table1[[3, 5, 8], :]
  ```
  
- **Explanation**: This extracts the 3rd, 5th, and 8th rows from `table1`.

### Joining Tables

Since you mentioned primary keys, you can join tables using these keys:
```julia
joined_table = innerjoin(table1, table2)
```

- **Explanation**: This joins `table1` and `table2` on their common column `ID`, which is the primary key in `table2`.

### Summary

Using Julia DB, you can easily create tables with specific columns, set primary keys for joining, and perform operations like indexing and extracting data. The examples provided demonstrate how to handle these tasks effectively.

The text describes two methods for creating tables in JuliaDB. Initially, it imports a pre-existing list and specifies columns as primary keys. The second method demonstrates creating lists within the table creation process. Using the `columns` function, specific column names are defined without using symbol notation. For example, an "ID" column is created from a previously defined list, while another column, "CRP," uses randomly generated values rounded to 16-bit integers based on a normal distribution (mean of 100, standard deviation of 20). Additionally, it's possible to specify multiple columns as primary keys using symbol notation. The text highlights the flexibility in defining tables and prepares for further exploration into selecting rows from these tables.
