Thank you.
Okay, the clinical crystal ball. Okay, this is where EGLE come in, the risk stratification that I mentioned earlier, where clinical findings is divided into major, intermediate, and minor risk factors.
I think it's also on the handout that I've given to you.
I'll quickly go through it.
The major predictors, clinical predictors of cardiovascular risk is, first of all, unstable coronary syndromes.
So that would be an acute or a recent myocardial infarction with evidence of important ischemic risk by clinical symptoms or non-invasive study.
Unstable or severe angina.
To classify angina, they use the Canadian cardiology, what was it, Canadian cardiology assessment score.
I think zero, just help me out, I think zero is a normal patient.
One is angina on severe exacerbation.
Class two is mild exacerbation.
Three is when there is one flight of stairs, you get angina.
And four is, yeah, angina at rest.
All right.
So you need to know that in order to use this EGLE classification as well.
Then decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmias, and severe valvular disease.
All classified as major predictors.
Intermediate clinical predictors would be mild angina, that is Canadian class 1 or 2.
Previous myocardial infarction by history or pathological evidence.
Q waves on your ECG.
Compensated or prior heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus, especially insulin-dependent diabetes.
And then renal insufficiency.
Your minor predictors would be advanced age, abnormal ECG,
like a left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, etc.
A rhythm other than sinus rhythm, like AF.
It's only a minor predictor.
And then your low functional capacity.
A history of stroke.
And then uncontrolled hypertension.
All right.
Sorry.
I just wanted to mention that in a lot of patients who are diabetic,
they might have atypical ischemia.
So you're not going to get the typical crushing chest pains.
You need to ask for ischemic equivalence,
which is dysmia, sweating, or any sympathetic,
signs of sympathetic activity if they're exerting themselves.
Yeah.
Also with the AF, so rhythm other than sinus,
AF is something that really limits the patient's ability
to provide a good mean arterial pressure.
So if it really has to tie in with the kind of surgery they're going to get.
If they're going to have toenail, it's not a big deal.
If they're going to have anything intra-abdominal,
like you said, a high risk surgery,
then there is a significant risk of hypertension.
So you have to kind of tie it in with the surgical procedure as well.
And whether or not, if it's an elective procedure
or an emergency procedure, the risk increases dramatically.
Even in a low-risk patient and with minor risk factors,
it's an elective procedure the risk is amplified.
Yeah.
The thing that's very important with Fizona is none of these things can be taken in,
you have to take the whole patient in consideration
and interlink your different risk factors to get, you know,
to decide how you're going to manage this patient.
The other important index to use for cardiac risk
is the modified cardiac risk index by Detsky.
It's also on the handout.
I'm not going to go through it again.
But basically you'll see the same things is important
in all these classifications.
History, age, previous MI, cardiac failure, ECG, and the chest X-ray.
That's what you need to stratify your risk.
Yeah, interestingly, I think with both cardiovascular
and with pulmonary risk stratification,
direct observation of the patient is extremely important.
And how well they tolerate physical activity is extremely, extremely important.
Like how they tolerate climbing to, I know we don't often do it,
but can they climb two flights of stairs?
How far can they walk without claudication or angina or whatever?
So really looking at your patient.
All right, then, especially, this goes for all your systems,
but especially in terms of cardiovascular risk,
the surgery itself is considered a major risk factor.
So again, you have certain surgeries that's considered high risk,
moderate risk, and minor risk.
Again, it was EGLE that had a stratification of that.
It's also on the handout.
I don't even know if it's worth going through this list.
I'm sure you can all read through it.
Basically, emergent operations obviously have a higher risk than any other.
Your direct vascular surgeries have a higher risk.
Orthopedic surgeries are always high up on cardiovascular risk.
And then, same with cardiovascular and pulmonary is upper abdominal poses a higher risk than lower abdominal.
Laparoscopic work, the lowest risk of all the intra-abdominal work that you can do.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sure.
Okay.
