In Lecture 2, the focus is on building foundational algebraic vocabulary. The key terms introduced are:

1. **Constants and Variables**: Constants are fixed values (like numbers) you can identify on the number line. Variables act as placeholders for any value.

2. **Expression**: An expression is a mathematical combination of constants and variables using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Parentheses may be used to dictate operation order within expressions.

3. **Term**: A term is a part of an expression, typically separated by plus (+) or minus (-) signs. Multiplication/division of elements within terms does not separate them.

4. **Equation**: An equation consists of two expressions set equal to each other, usually divided into left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS).

An example provided is the conversion formula from Fahrenheit to Celsius: \((5/9) \times (\text{Fahrenheit} - 32)\). This serves as an application of expressions in a practical context.

The lecture concludes with an equation example: \(3x = 9\), illustrating how two expressions can be set equal to form an equation.

The text provides an introduction to basic algebraic concepts and operations. It explains that equations consist of two equal expressions or terms, one on each side of the equality symbol. An operation involves applying mathematical functions (such as addition, multiplication, taking negatives) to numbers, variables, or more complex expressions.

Key points include:
- Operations can be performed on constants, variables, expressions, and terms.
- Examples of operations include negation, addition, square root, absolute value, and sign determination.
- The text highlights the importance of understanding how signs (positive and negative) affect operations. Specifically, it outlines rules for multiplication and division involving positive and negative numbers:
  - Positive × Positive = Positive
  - Positive × Negative = Negative
  - Negative × Positive = Negative
  - Negative × Negative = Positive
  - These same sign rules apply to division.
- Examples provided include simple multiplications (e.g., \(3 \times 4\), \(3 \times -4\)) and a more complex expression involving multiplication and division of negative numbers.

Overall, the text serves as an algebraic primer, focusing on operations and the significance of signs in calculations.

The text discusses how to determine the sign (positive or negative) of a mathematical expression involving multiplication and division of variables, all assumed to be greater than zero except when explicitly stated as negative.

1. The author explains that multiplying two negatives gives a positive result, and dividing a negative by another negative also results in a positive.
2. An example is provided where the product involves multiple positives and negatives: 
   - Negative times positive times positive results in a negative numerator.
   - Dividing this by negative factors results in a positive outcome because both the numerator and denominator are negative.
3. Another example includes more complex expressions:
   - With variables \( x, y, z \) all greater than zero (positive), they cannot be zero or negative.
   - The expression involves: 
     - Negative \( x \times y \times \)negative \( z \) in the numerator, resulting in a positive value.
     - In the denominator: 
       - Positive \( x \times \)negative \( y \times z \times \)negative \( x \times \)negative \( y \), which results in a negative value.
   - Therefore, dividing a positive by a negative yields a negative result.

The text emphasizes understanding how signs interact through multiplication and division to quickly determine the overall sign of complex expressions.
