The text discusses the concept of a mathematical series and differentiates it from sequences. A series is understood as a sequence of partial sums, where each term adds to the previous sum. For example, starting with a fraction like \( \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \), you can create a series by calculating:

- \( s_1 = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( s_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)

This process generates a sequence of partial sums: \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \ldots \). The series is viewed as the sum of these partial sums, while each individual term in the original expression (like \( \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \)) forms a separate sequence.

The text emphasizes understanding the difference between a series and a sequence. A sequence consists simply of elements like \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{6}, \ldots \) without summation, whereas a series involves summing these elements to form partial sums.

Additionally, convergence is discussed: the sequence formed by individual terms can be analyzed for convergence (e.g., its limit as \( n \to \infty \)). This analysis helps determine whether the corresponding series converges or diverges. The text mentions that methods such as checking if the infinite term of a sequence approaches zero can provide insights into the behavior of the series.

Overall, the key distinction is between the sequence of terms and the sequence of their cumulative sums (the series), with implications for convergence analysis in mathematics.

The text explains the concept of a series by focusing on its representation as a sequence of partial sums. Here's a concise summary:

- A **series** is viewed through the lens of its **partial sums**, where each term \( S_n \) represents the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the original series.
- The example given starts with the series defined by the terms \( \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \). The partial sums are computed as follows:
  - \( S_1 = \frac{1}{1 \times (1+1)} = \frac{1}{2} \)
  - \( S_2 = \frac{1}{2 \times (2+1)} + \frac{1}{1 \times (1+1)} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{3} \)
- As the index \( n \) increases, these partial sums form a sequence: \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \ldots \).
- The text distinguishes between the **sequence of terms** (\( a_n = \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \)) and the **series**, which is the sum of these terms.
- It emphasizes that while each term \( a_n \) approaches zero as \( n \) goes to infinity, this alone doesn't determine convergence of the series. The behavior of the sequence of partial sums must be analyzed to decide if the series converges or diverges.
- This distinction is crucial for understanding more advanced concepts like Taylor and Fourier series, where series are used to represent functions.

The text aims to clarify these foundational ideas by contrasting sequences and series and highlighting their respective roles in mathematical analysis.
