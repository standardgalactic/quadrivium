The text discusses the concept of a mathematical series and differentiates it from sequences. A series is understood as a sequence of partial sums, where each term adds to the previous sum. For example, starting with a fraction like \( \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \), you can create a series by calculating:

- \( s_1 = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( s_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)

This process generates a sequence of partial sums: \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \ldots \). The series is viewed as the sum of these partial sums, while each individual term in the original expression (like \( \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \)) forms a separate sequence.

The text emphasizes understanding the difference between a series and a sequence. A sequence consists simply of elements like \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{6}, \ldots \) without summation, whereas a series involves summing these elements to form partial sums.

Additionally, convergence is discussed: the sequence formed by individual terms can be analyzed for convergence (e.g., its limit as \( n \to \infty \)). This analysis helps determine whether the corresponding series converges or diverges. The text mentions that methods such as checking if the infinite term of a sequence approaches zero can provide insights into the behavior of the series.

Overall, the key distinction is between the sequence of terms and the sequence of their cumulative sums (the series), with implications for convergence analysis in mathematics.
