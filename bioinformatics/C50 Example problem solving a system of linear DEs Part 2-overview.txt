It looks like you're working through a complex problem involving differential equations or systems of linear equations. Let's break down your situation and attempt to clarify the steps involved.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Identifying Particular Solutions:**
   - You are trying to find particular solutions \(x_p(t)\) and \(y_p(t)\).
   - The forms you have chosen for these solutions suggest that they involve polynomial terms combined with exponential terms, specifically:
     \[
     x_p(t) = (a t^2 + b t + c) e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_p(t) = (d t^2 + e t + f) e^{t}
     \]

2. **Substituting into Equations:**
   - You substitute these forms back into the original differential equations to solve for coefficients \(a, b, c, d, e,\) and \(f\).

3. **Finding Coefficients:**
   - By substituting and equating terms, you find specific values for some of these coefficients:
     \[
     a = 1, \quad b = -2, \quad c = 0
     \]
     \[
     d = 1, \quad e = 0, \quad f = 0
     \]

4. **Constructing Particular Solutions:**
   - With these coefficients, your particular solutions become:
     \[
     x_p(t) = (t^2 - 2t)e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_p(t) = t^2 e^{t}
     \]

5. **General Solution and Homogeneous Part:**
   - The general solution to a system of differential equations typically involves the sum of the homogeneous solution \(x_h, y_h\) and particular solutions \(x_p, y_p\).
   - You mention needing to find these homogeneous solutions using an auxiliary equation:
     \[
     (r^2 - 1)(r + 1)^3 = 0
     \]
   - This gives roots \(r = -1, -1, -1, 1\).

6. **Formulating Homogeneous Solutions:**
   - The general form for the homogeneous solutions based on these roots is:
     \[
     x_h(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t + c_3 t^2)e^{-t} + c_4 e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_h(t) = (d_1 + d_2 t + d_3 t^2)e^{-t} + d_4 e^{t}
     \]

7. **General Solution:**
   - Combining both parts, the general solutions are:
     \[
     x(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t + c_3 t^2)e^{-t} + c_4 e^{t} + (t^2 - 2t)e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y(t) = (d_1 + d_2 t + d_3 t^2)e^{-t} + d_4 e^{t} + t^2 e^{t}
     \]

8. **Applying Initial Conditions:**
   - You need to apply the initial conditions \(x(0) = 0\) and \(y(0) = 1\) to find specific values for the constants \(c_i\) and \(d_i\).

### Solving with Initial Conditions

- Substitute \(t = 0\) into your general solutions:
  - For \(x(t)\):
    \[
    x(0) = c_1 + c_4 = 0
    \]
  - For \(y(t)\):
    \[
    y(0) = d_1 + d_4 = 1
    \]

- You'll solve these equations along with any others that arise from further derivatives or conditions to find the specific constants.

### Conclusion

This process involves substituting back into your differential equations, solving for coefficients, and applying initial conditions. It's a systematic approach often used in solving systems of linear differential equations. If you have more specific questions or need help with particular steps, feel free to ask!
