It looks like you're working through a complex problem involving differential equations or systems of linear equations. Let's break down your situation and attempt to clarify the steps involved.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Identifying Particular Solutions:**
   - You are trying to find particular solutions \(x_p(t)\) and \(y_p(t)\).
   - The forms you have chosen for these solutions suggest that they involve polynomial terms combined with exponential terms, specifically:
     \[
     x_p(t) = (a t^2 + b t + c) e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_p(t) = (d t^2 + e t + f) e^{t}
     \]

2. **Substituting into Equations:**
   - You substitute these forms back into the original differential equations to solve for coefficients \(a, b, c, d, e,\) and \(f\).

3. **Finding Coefficients:**
   - By substituting and equating terms, you find specific values for some of these coefficients:
     \[
     a = 1, \quad b = -2, \quad c = 0
     \]
     \[
     d = 1, \quad e = 0, \quad f = 0
     \]

4. **Constructing Particular Solutions:**
   - With these coefficients, your particular solutions become:
     \[
     x_p(t) = (t^2 - 2t)e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_p(t) = t^2 e^{t}
     \]

5. **General Solution and Homogeneous Part:**
   - The general solution to a system of differential equations typically involves the sum of the homogeneous solution \(x_h, y_h\) and particular solutions \(x_p, y_p\).
   - You mention needing to find these homogeneous solutions using an auxiliary equation:
     \[
     (r^2 - 1)(r + 1)^3 = 0
     \]
   - This gives roots \(r = -1, -1, -1, 1\).

6. **Formulating Homogeneous Solutions:**
   - The general form for the homogeneous solutions based on these roots is:
     \[
     x_h(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t + c_3 t^2)e^{-t} + c_4 e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y_h(t) = (d_1 + d_2 t + d_3 t^2)e^{-t} + d_4 e^{t}
     \]

7. **General Solution:**
   - Combining both parts, the general solutions are:
     \[
     x(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t + c_3 t^2)e^{-t} + c_4 e^{t} + (t^2 - 2t)e^{t}
     \]
     \[
     y(t) = (d_1 + d_2 t + d_3 t^2)e^{-t} + d_4 e^{t} + t^2 e^{t}
     \]

8. **Applying Initial Conditions:**
   - You need to apply the initial conditions \(x(0) = 0\) and \(y(0) = 1\) to find specific values for the constants \(c_i\) and \(d_i\).

### Solving with Initial Conditions

- Substitute \(t = 0\) into your general solutions:
  - For \(x(t)\):
    \[
    x(0) = c_1 + c_4 = 0
    \]
  - For \(y(t)\):
    \[
    y(0) = d_1 + d_4 = 1
    \]

- You'll solve these equations along with any others that arise from further derivatives or conditions to find the specific constants.

### Conclusion

This process involves substituting back into your differential equations, solving for coefficients, and applying initial conditions. It's a systematic approach often used in solving systems of linear differential equations. If you have more specific questions or need help with particular steps, feel free to ask!

It looks like you're working through a complex system of differential equations and trying to find particular solutions using methods such as undetermined coefficients. Let me help clarify the process:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **System Setup**:
   - You have a system of linear differential equations:
     \[
     x'' + 4x = t^2
     \]
     \[
     y'' + y' + 3y = e^{-t}
     \]

2. **Homogeneous Solutions**:
   - For \( x(t) \), the characteristic equation is \( r^2 + 4 = 0 \), giving roots \( r = \pm 2i \). The homogeneous solution is:
     \[
     x_h(t) = c_1 \cos(2t) + c_2 \sin(2t)
     \]
   - For \( y(t) \), the characteristic equation is \( r^2 + r + 3 = 0 \). Solving gives complex roots, leading to:
     \[
     y_h(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t}(c_3 \cos(\sqrt{\frac{11}{4}}t) + c_4 \sin(\sqrt{\frac{11}{4}}t))
     \]

3. **Particular Solutions**:
   - For \( x(t) \), use the method of undetermined coefficients. Assume a particular solution of the form:
     \[
     x_p(t) = At^2 + Bt + C
     \]
     Substitute into the differential equation and solve for \( A, B, \) and \( C \).

   - For \( y(t) \), assume a particular solution of the form:
     \[
     y_p(t) = Ae^{-t}
     \]
     Substitute into the differential equation and solve for \( A \).

4. **General Solutions**:
   - Combine homogeneous and particular solutions:
     \[
     x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t)
     \]
     \[
     y(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t)
     \]

5. **System Connection**:
   - You mentioned using the first derivative of \( y(t) \) to find \( x(t) \). This implies a coupling between the equations, possibly through initial conditions or constraints.

6. **Solving for Coefficients**:
   - Use any given initial conditions or additional constraints to solve for the constants \( c_1, c_2, c_3, \) and \( c_4 \).

7. **Expressing in Terms of Fewer Constants**:
   - You derived relationships between coefficients (e.g., \( c_4 = 2c_2 + 2c_3 \)). Use these to express all solutions in terms of a minimal set of constants.

### Final Solution

Your final solution will be expressions for \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) in terms of the fewest possible constants, using the relationships derived from substituting into the differential equations and applying any initial conditions or constraints.

This process demonstrates how to systematically approach solving a system of linear differential equations with given non-homogeneous terms. If you have specific values for initial conditions, substitute them to find the exact coefficients.
