The text outlines conducting basic descriptive statistics in SPSS for both numerical and categorical data. It explains how to calculate simple statistical measures—mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range—for numerical variables such as age or heart rate, either individually or collectively. For categorical data, it describes using cross-tabulation (Cross Tabs) to create matrices that display counts of outcomes based on categories like diabetes status versus patient outcome (survived/died). Additionally, the text suggests further analysis by splitting data into subgroups to compare specific metrics, such as age differences between survivors and non-survivors.
