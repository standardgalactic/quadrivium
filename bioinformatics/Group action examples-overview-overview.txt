The text explains group actions with an emphasis on non-faithful group actions. A group action involves a group \( G \) acting on a set \( A \), where each group element corresponds to a permutation of \( A \). In faithful actions, each permutation is uniquely associated with an element of \( G \); in non-faithful actions, multiple elements can correspond to the same permutation.

The first example of non-faithful action shows all elements of \( G \) mapping to the identity permutation on set \( A \), leaving all elements unchanged. This satisfies group action properties like closure and compatibility with the group operation.

The second example uses Cayley's table, where a group acts on itself via its binary operation, demonstrating how group actions can represent the groupâ€™s structure using its own elements and operations.

Overall, the text illustrates that non-faithful group actions occur and provide insights into understanding group properties. It also describes how binary operations in groups are viewed as self-actions, emphasizing internal symmetry and structure through these operations.
