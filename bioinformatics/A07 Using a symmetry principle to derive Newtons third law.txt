now what I want to show you in this video quickly well I say quickly but a
very simple way for you again an example to start thinking like a physicist can I
derive Newton's third law from a symmetry principle so we can have a
symmetry principle we're going to do a thought experiment so that's exciting as
well Einstein's famous for his thought experiment we're going to do a thought
experiment it's called virtual displacement by d'Alembert then we're
going to see there's a concert of quantity and from there we're going to
get a law of nature so this is the proper way of thinking since the time of
Einstein since 1905 we know that we don't start to the laws of nature start
with a symmetry principle and we are going to accept two laws of nature that we
are going to accept them as being true and that's the second law and once we
accept the second law we have to invariably accept the first law as well
you cannot have the second law without the existence of the first law
equilibrium in a translational space you can't have that so the symmetry
principle we're going to have is it's look translational
so that's my symmetry principle what I'm saying is the following translation means I move an
object a system of particles from one location to another location and trans
locate them translational you get a rotational you did also here we're going
to translate them and if I have a system of N particles I wanted also to be a
solid crystalline structure so the inter particle distances and relative
positions also remain intact there's not gas atoms or molecules that are moving
out invariance invariance is just a fancy word meaning there's no change there's
some aspect of it that doesn't of something that doesn't change okay so
there's no change happens okay of something that I am referring to
homogeneous space that just means wherever you are as far as positional
concerned from a macroscopic to the tiniest sub microscopic properties of that
space does not differ so that's not really true of time space space time I
should say because you do get warping due to large mass etc etc but we're going to
have homogeneous space in other words all properties all properties of the space is
exactly the same in respect of a position so we're going to have this
translational invariance and homogeneous space that is a symmetry there's some
symmetry to it there's a beauty that's it's the same no matter what you look
where you look from or whatever there's this it's a symmetry principle there's
no other words used for it so I'm going to have translational invariance so it means
something doesn't change because of this movement in space so that's my symmetry
principle now I'm going to make use of a thought experiment and this is
it's called virtual displacement virtual displacement so what I'm going to do I'm going to imagine the system of in particles in particle system
particle system and I'm going to move it from point a there to point b there and there is my vector r
that's my position vector and I'm going to move it from there and the length of this is some distance delta s
some distance delta s and let's make that a vector as well so it's a distance and a direction
okay but something is not going to change in doing this that is the invariance the translational means I actually have it there then I have it there
the space is homogeneous so all the properties here are exactly the same as all the properties there and the virtual displacement is I'm going to consider a thought experiment whereby I have the object there
3d letters so the the atoms don't change position of the relative to each other and I just translate it from there to there but it's instantaneously no time not not a limit as time goes to zero no time so it's a thought experiment I can't
I can't ever do this in reality if that if that happens and the other thing I should say is an in particle system in a closed system in particle system in a closed system so there's no external forces other than the forces in between the particles so if if I did this thought experiment that just means that the work done should be zero no work is done instantaneously
and then it's there so so so this delta w is zero and what is work is the the scalar product or the dot product of force and distance what are the forces involved now my little thought experiments is a closed system so the only forces involved is the sum
of all these internal forces k equals one to infinity and that's a dot product with delta s
so I have that dot product now I can write that summation a bit better I can really write this as the sum of k equals one to n of the sum of so for instance i equals one to n of f let's make it ki and here I have i does not equal k
okay I rewrite it like that doesn't matter how you write it remember you can say this is the force on the kth particle by the i-th particle just think about it there's n particles so every particle will have other forces on it n minus one other forces there are n particles I'm looking just at one so n minus one all the other ones left they all have an influence on this particle so I'm just summing them so it's I start with the first particle and I can't have i equals k so it can't be one one
one one that one particle is not going to have a force on itself so particle two on one three on one four on one five on one and then start with particle two one on two two on two can't happen then three on two four on two five on two so it's just a rewrite of that just to be proper but it's a dot product and it's going to equal zero okay through my thought experiment
and the strategy principle that I've got on there now how can that be zero one thing one method for it to be zero we remember that the dot product the dot product between two vectors if I have vector a dot product vector b what is that I can also write it as the norm of vector a and the norm of vector b in other words the link times the cosine of the smallest
smallest angle between them okay so for cosine for that to be a zero I have to take the cosine of pi over 90 so the angle between those two are 90 but I don't want that I want invariance
translational invariance in homogeneous space in other words I want to arbitrarily be able to make this move this b needn't be there b might be there or there or there so I don't want to constrain myself to this pi over 2 radiance or 90 degree angle between the two
so I can't consider that angle to be the cause of the top product being zero I also want to actually move it there must be some translation translation I have to translate it from one position to another position so this can't be zero I don't want that to be zero
so the only other option available to me to have this little algebra being zero is to have the sum of all the forces the sum of all the forces
to equal zero
that's the only way I can do this
that's the only way I can do this
now think about it
we are now going to accept Newton's second law and then bi-implicitly we accept Newton's first law as well
where we have the fact that f equals dp dt
rate of change
rate of change of momentum Newton's second law
I'm going to have that and I'm going to plug this into my
I'm going to plug this into my equation
so instead of that I'm going to have the sum
of k equals 1 to n
of dp dt
dp dt
of k there equal to 0
and
if I sum all of those pk's
I can call it one probably one big p
capital p
we've seen us do that before
and the only way that a function like that p can be zero
its first derivative at least can be zero if p is a constant
if p is a constant and there suddenly jumps out my conserved quantity
momentum is conserved
now let's consider this to be n particles
let's consider this n to be 2
n to be 2
and so I know p
if p is then equal to
p sub 1 plus p sub 2
then if I add those two together
it's going to be a constant
there's conservation of linear momentum
so number one is from
from the symmetry principle
translational invariance and homogeneous space
I can show
I can show
also
that
there's a conserved quantity
and that conserved quantity
is linear momentum
ok
so if there's only a two
two particle
two particle system
remember now
if I have
dp
which is all my k's
all put together
the whole sum
dt
that is now
dp
1
dt
plus dp
2
dt
I'm just taking
the first derivative
with respect to time
on both sides
I'm using the property of derivatives
that I can just take
take it on both sides
of that plus sign
so
and that's going to equal zero
we just saw that
dp dt
is going to equal zero
so this is
zero
in other words
dp
1
dt
equals negative
dp
2
dt
or
if
particle 1
equals
negative
if
particle 2
or
the equal and opposite
the force on one
is equal and opposite
the force from the other
apologies for that
the recording stopped
and I'm not quite sure
where it stopped
what I did show
was
we started with a
symmetry principle
we used a virtual displacement
thought experiment
we got our conserved quantity
because the only way
that we accepted
Newton's second law
and thereby implicitly
Newton's first law
but not the third law
we're deriving the third law
we showed that
because of the symmetry principle
wherever there is a symmetry principle
there is
hiding somewhere
is a conserved quantity
a conservation law
we showed that to be
linear momentum
so from the symmetry principle
we see that linear momentum
is a conserved quantity
and we used Newton's second law
and basically Newton's first law
as well
and we showed that
if that rate of change
we used that to
rewrite this force
and for that to be zero
for the rate of change
of linear momentum
to be zero
that means
momentum
this momentum
has got to be
constant
it's got to be a constant
because the derivative
of a constant is zero
and if I just consider
a two particle system now
and I take
ddt on both sides
I'm going to end up
with that equaling zero
if I take it to the other side
bring it back to f
I have Newton's third law
