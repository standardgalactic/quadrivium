The text explains various methods for calculating the area of a triangle. The standard formula is half the base times the height (\( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \)). This arises because two similar triangles can form a rectangle.

Additional formulas incorporate trigonometric relationships, such as using the sine function. For triangle ABC, with \( S \) representing surface area and \( H \) being the height:

1. Using sine of angle A: \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times CB \times \sin(A) \)
2. Using sine of angle B: \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times CA \times \sin(B) \)

By symmetry, another formula is \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times \sin(C) \).

The text further explores algebraic manipulation using the Pythagorean theorem. For triangles CAP and CBP:

- \( B^2 = H^2 + (C - X)^2 \)
- \( A^2 = H^2 + X^2 \)

Solving these, you derive:

\[ 2CX = A^2 - B^2 + C^2 \]

Solving for \( X \):

\[ X = \frac{A^2 - B^2 + C^2}{2C} \]

Substitute into the expression for height \( H \):

\[ H = \sqrt{A^2 - \left(\frac{A^2 - B^2 + C^2}{2C}\right)^2} \]

Finally, substitute \( H \) back into the area formula:

\[ S = \frac{1}{2} \times C \times \sqrt{A^2 - \left(\frac{A^2 - B^2 + C^2}{2C}\right)^2} \]

The text concludes by mentioning that other methods, including those involving the cosine relationship, will be explored in a subsequent video.
