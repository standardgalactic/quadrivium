The text describes solving a differential equation in its exact form. The equation given involves functions of \(x\) and \(y\), specifically:

\[ m(x, y) = e^{2y} - y \cos(xy) \]
\[ n(x, y) = 2x e^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + 2y \]

The goal is to determine if this differential equation is exact. For a differential equation \( M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0 \) to be exact, the condition:

\[ \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} \]

must hold.

The solution involves calculating these partial derivatives:
- The derivative of \( m \) with respect to \( y \):
  \[ \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = 2e^{2y} - \cos(xy) - xy \sin(xy) \]
  
- The derivative of \( n \) with respect to \( x \):
  \[ \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} = 2e^{2y} - \cos(xy) - xy \sin(xy) \]

Since these derivatives are equal, the equation is confirmed as exact.

Next, the text integrates \( m(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( n(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \), treating the other variable as a constant during integration. The integral of \( m(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) gives:

\[ f(x, y) = xe^{2y} - \sin(xy) + g(y) \]

Where \( g(y) \) is an unknown function of \( y \). To determine \( g(y) \), the partial derivative of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \) is set equal to \( n(x, y) \):

\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xe^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + g'(y) = 2x e^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + 2y \]

This leads to the differential equation for \( g(y) \):

\[ g'(y) = 2y \]

Integrating both sides gives:

\[ g(y) = y^2 + C \]

Thus, the solution to the original differential equation is:

\[ f(x, y) = xe^{2y} - \sin(xy) + y^2 + C = 0 \]

This represents a family of solutions, where \( C \) is an arbitrary constant. The text concludes by acknowledging that solving explicitly for one variable in terms of the other might not be feasible due to the transcendental nature of the equation.
