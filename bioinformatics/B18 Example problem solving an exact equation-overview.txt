The text describes solving a differential equation in its exact form. The equation given involves functions of \(x\) and \(y\), specifically:

\[ m(x, y) = e^{2y} - y \cos(xy) \]
\[ n(x, y) = 2x e^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + 2y \]

The goal is to determine if this differential equation is exact. For a differential equation \( M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0 \) to be exact, the condition:

\[ \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} \]

must hold.

The solution involves calculating these partial derivatives:
- The derivative of \( m \) with respect to \( y \):
  \[ \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = 2e^{2y} - \cos(xy) - xy \sin(xy) \]
  
- The derivative of \( n \) with respect to \( x \):
  \[ \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} = 2e^{2y} - \cos(xy) - xy \sin(xy) \]

Since these derivatives are equal, the equation is confirmed as exact.

Next, the text integrates \( m(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( n(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \), treating the other variable as a constant during integration. The integral of \( m(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) gives:

\[ f(x, y) = xe^{2y} - \sin(xy) + g(y) \]

Where \( g(y) \) is an unknown function of \( y \). To determine \( g(y) \), the partial derivative of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \) is set equal to \( n(x, y) \):

\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xe^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + g'(y) = 2x e^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + 2y \]

This leads to the differential equation for \( g(y) \):

\[ g'(y) = 2y \]

Integrating both sides gives:

\[ g(y) = y^2 + C \]

Thus, the solution to the original differential equation is:

\[ f(x, y) = xe^{2y} - \sin(xy) + y^2 + C = 0 \]

This represents a family of solutions, where \( C \) is an arbitrary constant. The text concludes by acknowledging that solving explicitly for one variable in terms of the other might not be feasible due to the transcendental nature of the equation.

The text discusses solving a differential equation presented in its differential form. The problem involves determining if the given equation is exact by checking if the mixed partial derivatives of functions \(m(x, y)\) and \(n(x, y)\) are equal.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Equation Setup**: The differential equation is expressed as:
   \[
   m(x, y) \, dx + n(x, y) \, dy = 0
   \]
   where:
   - \(m(x, y) = e^{2y} - y \cos(xy)\)
   - \(n(x, y) = 2x e^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + 2y\)

2. **Checking Exactness**: To verify if the equation is exact, compute:
   - \(\frac{\partial m}{\partial y}\)
   - \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial x}\)

3. **Partial Derivatives**:
   - \(\frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = 2e^{2y} - \cos(xy) + xy \sin(xy)\)
   - \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial x} = 2e^{2y} - \cos(xy) + xy \sin(xy)\)

   Since these partial derivatives are equal, the equation is exact.

4. **Solving the Exact Equation**:
   - Integrate \(m(x, y)\) with respect to \(x\) to find a function \(f(x, y)\):
     \[
     f(x, y) = x e^{2y} - \sin(xy) + g(y)
     \]
   - Differentiate \(f(x, y)\) with respect to \(y\) and equate it to \(n(x, y)\) to find \(g(y)\):
     \[
     \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2x e^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + g'(y)
     \]
   - Set this equal to \(n(x, y)\) and solve for \(g'(y)\):
     \[
     g'(y) = 2y
     \]
   - Integrate to find \(g(y)\):
     \[
     g(y) = y^2 + C
     \]

5. **General Solution**: The solution is:
   \[
   f(x, y) = x e^{2y} - \sin(xy) + y^2 + C = 0
   \]
   This represents a family of solutions to the differential equation.

The text concludes by noting that while an explicit expression for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) is not possible due to transcendental functions, the solution can be expressed implicitly.
