let's move on to absolute values you can see there what the absolute value is let me just
click on this code cell you can see i executed that so it's latech code backslash left and
upright backslash right on upright there so that just shows you it's going to do these absolute
value signs for me they have negative one negative a equals a so if you just look at that carefully
you'll see how latech works it's not difficult and that gives me this beautiful mathematic
rendering of the notation there so absolute abs that's the absolute value say of negative 10
that's going to return just 10 there's also the abs squared abs 2 for abs squared so it's going to take
the square of the absolute value for for us this is going to be 100. moving on to trigonometric
functions and you see there how i constructed that you can have a look at that and they are indeed all
the trigonometric functions are they have just listed a few of them so just to introduce pi to you
so we can say what is the sign of pi now what is the sign of pi what is pi is 180 degrees what do
you expect to see what is the sign you might remember what the sign of pi is or the sign of 180 degrees
it's got to be zero and if we execute this we get something funny now it says 1.22 times 10 to the
power negative 16 that is what it's saying saying there now this is peculiar to the fact that computers
cannot really deal with irrational numbers it's going to truncate them somewhere it's got to cut it
off somewhere it cannot use values without end i mean pi has no end the value pi 3.141592653 etc etc etc etc
it never stops but the computer can't deal with that so it's got to stop some way and in this
as i said we're going to have a look at types in using pi as such it is not the true value of pi
pi and when doing the sign of this value that it does hold for pi it's still within its limits to
do that calculation of this definitive number and it's going to do its best and it's going to throw
out this value of 1.2 times 10 to the power negative 16 which you have to accept as being zero that is
just the way a computer works and and you have to live with it now the next thing i want to show you is
just you can force the fact that you want to deal with degrees instead of radians so i can say sine
and i just can put a d at the end so now if i do the sine of 180 180 is really an integer so it's going
to do that properly for me that is zero and just in case you were wondering you can also just very
easily calculate the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle if one side is three the other side is four
of the right angle or orthogonal sides it's going to work out the hypotenuse for us which is very
simply five one more thing for this part of the lesson i'm just going to show you how to use signs
the sine of a value if it's a positive value it's going to return plus one if it's a negative value
it's going to turn negative one and if it's a zero it's going to do that so let's say what is the sign
of the sine of pi so we know it's going to return a positive as opposed to a zero because of what we
saw upstairs that the sine of pi is not going to return a zero for us but if we just simply said what
is the sine of 180 degrees but remember it's the sine in degrees so we have to use the sin d function
that's going to return a zero for us because it is neither positive nor negative
