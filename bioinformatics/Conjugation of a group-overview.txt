The text explains how conjugation within a group \( G \) can be viewed as a group action on the set \( A \), where \( A \) is exactly the set comprising all elements of \( G \). Conjugation typically involves transforming an element \( A \) in the group by another element \( G \) via the operation: \( GAG^{-1} \).

The text outlines that conjugation can be expressed as a group action, written as \( G.A = GAG^{-1} \), allowing each element of the group to be seen as a permutation of the set. This interpretation shows how elements of the group permute or rearrange the other elements.

For this construction to qualify as a valid group action, two properties must hold:
1. **Compatibility with Group Operation**: For any elements \( G_1 \), \( G_2 \) in \( G \) and element \( A \) in \( A \), the action of their product on \( A \) should equal the composition of their individual actions: 
   \[
   (G_1 G_2)A = G_1(G_2A)
   \]
2. **Identity Action**: The identity element \( E \) of the group must act as an identity permutation, meaning:
   \[
   EA = A
   \]

The text verifies these properties for conjugation and shows that they hold, confirming that conjugation can indeed be viewed as a group action.

Additionally, if the group \( G \) is abelian (commutative), the conjugation of any element by any other results in the element itself: \( GAG^{-1} = A \). This implies that every group action under conjugation becomes an identity permutation when \( G \) is abelian. Essentially, each element maps to itself without changing order or position within the set, highlighting a unique property of abelian groups.

The text discusses viewing group conjugation as a group action. Typically, for an element \( A \) in a group \( G \), the conjugate by another element \( g \in G \) is given by \( gAg^{-1} \). The speaker suggests extending this idea to consider \( G \) itself acting on its own set of elements through conjugation.

Here's how:

1. **Conjugation as a Group Action**: Define an action \( g.A = gAg^{-1} \) for any \( A, g \in G \). This means each element of the group can be viewed as a permutation of the group's own set of elements.

2. **Properties Verification**:
   - For two elements \( g_1, g_2 \in G \), we need to show that \( (g_1g_2).A = g_1.(g_2.A) \).
     \[
     (g_1g_2).A = g_1g_2Ag_2^{-1}g_1^{-1}
     \]
     \[
     g_1.(g_2.A) = g_1(g_2Ag_2^{-1})g_1^{-1} = g_1g_2Ag_2^{-1}g_1^{-1}
     \]
   - For the identity element \( e \in G \), show that \( e.A = A \).
     \[
     e.A = eAe^{-1} = A
     \]

3. **Abelian Groups**: If \( G \) is abelian, then conjugation simplifies because \( gAg^{-1} = A \) for all \( g, A \in G \). Thus, the action of any group element on another element results in the identity permutation.

Overall, this perspective allows us to interpret elements of a group as permutations of the set comprising the group, providing deeper insight into the structure and behavior of groups through conjugation.
