The text explains how conjugation within a group \( G \) can be viewed as a group action on the set \( A \), where \( A \) is exactly the set comprising all elements of \( G \). Conjugation typically involves transforming an element \( A \) in the group by another element \( G \) via the operation: \( GAG^{-1} \).

The text outlines that conjugation can be expressed as a group action, written as \( G.A = GAG^{-1} \), allowing each element of the group to be seen as a permutation of the set. This interpretation shows how elements of the group permute or rearrange the other elements.

For this construction to qualify as a valid group action, two properties must hold:
1. **Compatibility with Group Operation**: For any elements \( G_1 \), \( G_2 \) in \( G \) and element \( A \) in \( A \), the action of their product on \( A \) should equal the composition of their individual actions: 
   \[
   (G_1 G_2)A = G_1(G_2A)
   \]
2. **Identity Action**: The identity element \( E \) of the group must act as an identity permutation, meaning:
   \[
   EA = A
   \]

The text verifies these properties for conjugation and shows that they hold, confirming that conjugation can indeed be viewed as a group action.

Additionally, if the group \( G \) is abelian (commutative), the conjugation of any element by any other results in the element itself: \( GAG^{-1} = A \). This implies that every group action under conjugation becomes an identity permutation when \( G \) is abelian. Essentially, each element maps to itself without changing order or position within the set, highlighting a unique property of abelian groups.
