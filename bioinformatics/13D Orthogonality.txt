Okay, so with Euclidean in space, we're going to look at orthogonality.
And where we have the four vectors in two and three space, we said that if vector u, dot product vector v, equals zero,
and those two vectors are orthogonal or to each other, they are orthogonal or they're perpendicular to each other.
And because we look at this matter as a dot product, as Euclidean inner product,
we saw that this held also for r4 space, r5 space, any rn space, not only for r2 and r3.
If they are perpendicular to each other, these two vectors, then by the Pythagorean theorem,
this was u, and it is indeed orthogonal to vector v, and this was u plus v,
from the Pythagorean theorem, we will see that the norm of vector u plus vector v squared equals vector u
squared plus norm of vector v, also squared.
Okay, but that holds only if these two vectors are indeed orthogonal.
