I want to
spend a few videos just looking at some definitions of terms.
Some examiners might want you to solve
a lot of matrix equations, but some might concentrate
a bit on definitions and give you problems
to test whether you have knowledge or know what these definitions are
instead of perhaps solving
a matrix equation. So some of these definitions
in some of these definitions I will use concepts that might come
in only in later videos and might not make a lot of sense
but I have to fit them somewhere in the playlist. So a few
videos on definitions.
The first one we're going to get to is inconsistent linear set.
Now I will use two terms, a linear set
or a set of linear equations.
That all means
those two terms mean the same thing.
And we've looked at this
in a previous video
where we said we're just dealing with
linear equations. In other words
all our unknowns, whether we name them
x1, x2, x3, 3, xn
equals some constant on the other side, some constant
or whether we name them y
or let's say x, y, z, etc
equals some other constant
doesn't matter what we name them
but they are linear. Linear means they are all to the power 1
and that is it. It's not the sign of them
they're not squared
they're not to the power negative 1
it's not the square root of them 1
it is a variable to the power 1
and all of them are the same
and it's also not x, y, and then z
there's no multiplication of them
they each stand on their own
in between plus or minus signs
and that is it
that is a linear system
or a set of linear equations
so that is what we are dealing with.
So what is a consistent linear set
or a set of linear equations?
An inconsistent set means
it is a set that has no solutions
no solutions
no solutions
and obviously if it is consistent
there is a solution or solutions
because we are dealing with linear systems
what that means in basic algebra
back to school
is if I have a coordinate system
Cartesian coordinate system
all my equations are straight lines
straight lines
and if I have two parallel lines
like those two equations
describing two parallel lines
they will never cross
in other words
this linear set of two equations
this linear system
will have no solutions
alternatively
alternatively
these are not curves
these are straight lines
that is what a linear system means
to the power one
alternatively
if those
cross somewhere
there is one single solution
and if I have three equations
they still cross
and there is one single solution
so there is either going to be no solution
and that is an inconsistent linear system
or they are going to be consistent
and there are two forms of consistent equations
there was the one
they all crossed in one point
the other one is
both lines are just on top of each other
both lines are just on top of each other
and that system has infinitely many solutions
any xy or xyz
if it is in three dimensions
any point there
any point there
will give me an xy coordinate system
will solve
will be a solution to both
those equations
so it is either nothing and the lines are parallel
or in one point
or infinitely many solutions
so the solutions to a linear system
we have just seen there are three solutions
either none
or exactly one
or infinitely many
with a linear system you can't have two
these lines are straight lines
they don't bend back to cross each other again
so that is one of the three
there are only three solutions to a linear system
what is an elementary row operation
we have just done echelon form
row echelon form
reduced row echelon form
so what is an elementary row operation
well there are three of them as well
number one is
if I have my a b c d e f g h i j k l
there is my augmented matrix
and remember what the difference is
between an augmented matrix
and just a matrix
if I have my equation here
it would have been a x1
plus b x2
plus c x3
equals d
and I will have
e x1
plus f x2
plus g x3
equals h
and i j k
equals l
as far as x1 plus x2
plus x3 is concerned
so I included my constant answers
on the right hand side
and some people will always
put some form of line in here
just to denote that this is an augmented matrix
so we start with elementary row operations
there is my augmented matrix
if I just put these in
they would have just been a matrix
now this is an augmented matrix
of this linear set
set of linear equations
and these are my constants
remember that I have just plugged in there
in there
I can exchange rows
so I can write
so I can write
I can write E F G H
I can then write A B C D
and I can write I J E K L
so I've just exchanged rows
that's my first elementary row operation
and remember I want in the top row
this to be a leading 1
that means if you read from the left hand side
the first non-zero number
that you should strike
must be a 1
that is a leading 1
so if this was a 0
and this was a 0
this was a 0
this better be a 1
that will make this my leading 1
so any non-zero
the first non-zero number
that you strike should be a 1
that is what you aim for
ok so that was one elementary row operation
just exchanging rows
later we'll see that you do the same with columns
you get elementary column operations
but we'll stick with rows
ok
next we can multiply out
any row by a number
and if I had A X 1 plus B X 2 plus C X 3 equals D
remember if I multiply this whole thing out by 2
that will just be a 2 A 2 B 2 C equals 2 D
that is an elementary row operation
that will just be a 2 A 2 B 2 C equals 2 D
that is an elementary row operation
that is an elementary row operation
I multiply row out by a non-zero number
I could also have multiplied it out by negative 1 half
as long as it's a non-zero number
then I can add or subtract
multiples of one row with the other
so I could have
if I multiplied this row out by 2
I would get 2 A 2 B 2 C 2 D
and now I can take this 2 A
and now I can take this 2 A
and I can take this row
and I can subtract this row from that row
but it's going to be this element with that element
this element with that element
third one on the third one
fourth one on the fourth one
each one in this
each number in this row
is called an element of that row
I've just got to stick element to element
so I can say
I can now have a new
A B C D
but now I'm going to have 2 A minus E
2 A minus E
I'm going to have 2 B minus F
I'm going to have 2 C minus G
and I'm going to have 2 D minus H
that would have been my new
and these are the numbers
so I just multiply them out and subtract
or the other thing I could have done
is multiplied this whole thing out
say by negative 2, negative 2, negative 2, negative 2
and I can just add that new row of mine
which is a multiple of this first row
to this row
so I can add or subtract
I can do pluses or minuses
all I want to do
and we've seen this
I think I'll put these videos in
after the reduced row of short form
reduced row of short form videos
we need to make the first
position row 1, column 1
we need to make that a leading 1
and then below that we need zeros
ok
that will mean in the second row I will have a 0
and in this I need to try and make a 1
and I can do that by multiplying
some row by a non-zero number
and adding or subtracting that new one to
this row that I'm dealing with
to get a leading one
so those are the 3 elementary row operations
exchanging rows
multiplying out a row by a non-negative number
and then adding or subtracting
that new multiplied row with another row
you can do additions or subtractions
does not matter
in the next video we'll carry on with these definitions
