The text outlines various causes of hypothyroidism, including iodine deficiency, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, radioactive iodine treatment or surgery, specific medications (iodide, potassium perchlorate, lithium, amiodarone), congenital thyroid issues, and secondary hypothyroidism resulting from hypothalamic or pituitary disorders like tumors, metastases, hemorrhage, necrosis, aneurysms, surgeries, trauma, infections, infiltrative diseases, and chronic lymphocytic hypophysitis.

It also discusses subclinical hypothyroidism, which shares the same causes as overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism converts to overt hypothyroidism at a rate of 4-18% per year and often reflects early stages of these conditions. Many patients recover normal thyroid function due to transient thyroiditis.

Laboratory diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism involves normal thyroid hormone levels with slightly elevated TSH levels. Symptoms can range from normal thyroid function (euthyroid state) to those seen in overt hypothyroidism. The subsequent content will focus on diagnosing and managing hypothyroidism.
