The text outlines several strategies for managing elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), focusing on different treatment modalities:

1. **Mannitol**: 
   - Used as a first-line treatment due to its osmotic diuretic effects, administered at 0.25-1 g/kg body weight.
   - Reduces brain edema and peaks in effectiveness within 30-60 minutes, lasting up to 6 hours.
   - More effective with bolus dosing than continuous infusion.
   - Should not be combined with furosemide due to risks of rapid diuresis and electrolyte imbalances.
   - Serum osmolality should remain below 320 mOsm/L to avoid renal damage, and urine output must be monitored.

2. **Hyperventilation**:
   - Temporarily reduces ICP by increasing minute ventilation, decreasing PaCO2, and causing cerebral vasoconstriction.
   - Should only be used briefly when other treatments fail, particularly for ICPs over 25 mm Hg.
   - Aims to maintain normocapnia (PaCO2 levels of 25-30 mm Hg) but is not recommended as a first-line treatment.

3. **Hypertonic Saline**:
   - Used when mannitol is no longer effective; it acutely decreases ICP.
   - Administered in concentrations up to 23.4% for boluses or 1.83% continuously.
   - Beneficial for patients with metabolic acidosis if sodium acetate is used instead of chloride.
   - Requires monitoring due to risks of hyperosmolality and acute kidney injury.

4. **Glucocorticoids**:
   - May reduce edema around brain tumors but are not recommended for managing raised ICP in other conditions.
   - Associated with increased rates of severe disability and death, making them unsuitable for this purpose.

These modalities provide various options tailored to specific patient needs when managing intracranial pressure.
