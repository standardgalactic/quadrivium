The text outlines a mathematical process for solving a differential equation using substitution and specific techniques. Here's a summary:

1. **Substitution**: The problem involves substituting \( t = \ln(x) \), which implies \( x = e^t \). This transforms the original function \( y(x) \) into a function of \( t \), denoted as \( y(t) \).

2. **Derivatives Transformation**:
   - The first derivative \( y' \) becomes \( \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{1}{e^t} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt} \).
   - The second derivative \( y'' \) becomes \( \frac{1}{x^2} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \frac{dy}{dt} \right) = \frac{1}{e^{2t}} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \frac{dy}{dt} \right) \).

3. **Differential Equation Transformation**: The original differential equation is transformed into:
   \[
   y'' - 2y' + y = 2x
   \]
   becomes:
   \[
   y''(t) - 2y'(t) + y(t) = 2e^t
   \]

4. **Solution Approach**:
   - The homogeneous part of the equation is solved using the auxiliary equation \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (m-1)^2 = 0 \). This gives a repeated root, leading to solutions of the form \( y_c(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t \).
   - For the particular solution \( y_p(t) \), the annihilator method is used. The non-homogeneous term \( 2e^t \) suggests a trial solution of \( at^2 e^t \).

5. **Particular Solution**:
   - Substituting \( y_p(t) = at^2 e^t \) into the differential equation and solving for \( a \), it is found that \( a = 1 \).
   - Thus, \( y_p(t) = t^2 e^t \).

6. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution in terms of \( t \) is \( y(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t + t^2 e^t \).

7. **Back Substitution**: To express the solution back in terms of \( x \):
   - Replace \( e^t \) with \( x \).
   - Replace \( t \) with \( \ln(x) \).

8. **Final Solution**:
   - The final expression for \( y(x) \) is:
     \[
     y(x) = c_1 x + c_2 \ln(x) \cdot x + (\ln(x))^2 \cdot x
     \]

This process demonstrates transforming, solving, and back-substituting a differential equation using substitution techniques.

The text describes a mathematical expression and its simplification. It starts by stating that \( t^2 \) will be given by the expression "natural log of \( x^2 \) times \( e \)" raised to the power of the natural log of \( x \). This is simplified as follows:

1. The expression involves \( c = c_1 \cdot e^{\ln(x)} \), which simplifies to \( c = x + c_2 \cdot x \ln(x) + x \ln(x^2) \).
2. Upon further simplification, the expression becomes \( x + c_2 \cdot x \ln(x) + 2x \ln(x) \).

The result matches an answer previously obtained using a different method, as emphasized by the repeated statement that it is "exactly the same answer."

The text discusses transforming and solving a differential equation by changing variables. Initially, it introduces the substitution \( t = \ln(x) \), implying \( x = e^t \). This leads to rewriting derivatives in terms of \( t \): specifically, \( y' = \frac{1}{x}y_t \) and \( y'' = \frac{1}{x^2}(y_{tt} - y_t) \).

Substituting these into the original differential equation results in a new form expressed as:
\[ y_{tt} - 2y_t + y = 2e^t. \]

This is identified as an Euler (or Cauchy-Euler) type equation, and various methods can be used to solve it.

### Solving the Homogeneous Part
The homogeneous part of the differential equation \( y_{tt} - 2y_t + y = 0 \) has a characteristic equation:
\[ m^2 - 2m + 1 = (m-1)^2 = 0, \]
with a repeated root \( m = 1 \). Thus, the complementary solution is:
\[ y_c(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t. \]

### Solving the Non-Homogeneous Part
Using the annihilator method for the non-homogeneous equation \( y_{tt} - 2y_t + y = 2e^t \), the annihilator of \( 2e^t \) is \( (D-1) \). Applying this to both sides gives a new differential equation:
\[ (D-1)^3 y = 0. \]

The particular solution form, avoiding terms already in the complementary solution, becomes:
\[ y_p(t) = a t^2 e^t. \]

Substituting \( y_p(t) = a t^2 e^t \) into the original differential equation and solving for \( a \), we find \( a = 1 \). Thus, the particular solution is:
\[ y_p(t) = t^2 e^t. \]

### General Solution
Combining both solutions, the general solution in terms of \( t \) is:
\[ y(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t + t^2 e^t. \]

Finally, reverting back to the original variable \( x \), since \( t = \ln(x) \) and \( e^t = x \), we have:
\[ y(x) = c_1 x + c_2 (\ln(x)) x + (\ln(x))^2 x. \]

The text describes a mathematical expression and its simplification process. Initially, \( t^2 \) is expressed as the natural log of \( x^2 \) multiplied by \( e \) raised to the power of the natural log of \( x \). This expression simplifies to \( c = c_1 \cdot e^{\ln(x)} \), which further reduces to \( c = c_1 \cdot x \). The complete simplified form is given as:

\[ c = c_2 \cdot x + x \cdot \ln(x) + x \cdot (\ln(x))^2. \]

This result matches the outcome obtained using another method, indicating consistency across different techniques used to derive it.
