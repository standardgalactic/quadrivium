Archimedes' Principle explains that any body fully or partially submerged in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal and opposite to its weight. This force is why objects appear lighter when submerged, reducing their apparent weight as measured by a scale due to this upward force.

Key points of Archimedes' Principle include:

1. **Apparent Weight**: The object's weight appears reduced underwater because the scale measures only the net downward force after accounting for buoyancy.
   
2. **Static Equilibrium**: For an object in equilibrium when submerged, the forces of gravity and buoyancy balance each other out.

3. **Buoyant Force**: This force is equivalent to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

4. **Density and Volume Considerations**: The extent of submersion depends on the density of the object relative to the fluid. The object's mass equals that of the displaced fluid, leading to:
   \[
   \text{density of object} \times \text{volume of object} = \text{density of fluid} \times \text{volume of fluid displaced}
   \]

5. **Calculating Submersion Height**: The height an object is submerged can be determined by the ratio of its density to the fluid's density:
   \[
   h_{\text{submerged}} = \left(\frac{\text{density of object} \times h_{\text{object}}}{\text{density of fluid}}\right)
   \]
   Here, \(h_{\text{object}}\) is the total height and \(h_{\text{submerged}}\) is how much is underwater.

Archimedes' Principle helps in solving problems related to buoyancy, such as predicting how deeply an object will sink into a fluid based on its density compared to the fluid.
