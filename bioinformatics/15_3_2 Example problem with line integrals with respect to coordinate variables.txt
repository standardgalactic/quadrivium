So let's have a look at this example. We have the f of x and y equals xy, x times y, and we want this
line integral with respect to x of our function, and this is our line.
This little line segment here. Now immediately look at it, the slope is going to be
2, and its y-intercept is going to be 1, so we're looking at a curve here, y,
equals 2x plus 1. And x is an element going from 0 to 1. So immediately we can, one way
to do this would be just to parametrize this curve. Let's put x equal to t, that
means y equals 2t plus 1. So we can make a vector r in t equals t and 2t plus 1.
Now, we can do that. So if we were to get the f of the r of t, that was going to equal
x times y, x times y, so that's t times 2t plus 1, that's going to be 2t squared plus t.
That's easy enough to do. Now, if x goes from 0 to 1, we can decide which way
this curve is going. Let's decide this is t0, that is t1. We are moving in this direction.
In other words, t is now also going to be an element from 0, or it's that series from 0
to 1. Inclusive. Because x equals t, and if x goes from 0 to 1, t will go from 0 to 1. So, let us just see what dx dt is going to be.
So, dx dt equals this 1. In other words, dx equals dt. dx equals dt. And what did we say we needed?
Well, it's going to be the integral of going from 0 to 1 of this, which is 2t squared plus t.
And what are we going to replace dx with? Well, that is just going to be dt. That is just going to be dt.
That will leave us with 2 thirds, t to the power 3 plus 1 half t squared, all going from 0 to 1.
That leaves us with 2 thirds plus 1 half. And that leaves us with 7 over 6.
That leaves us with 7 over 6.
