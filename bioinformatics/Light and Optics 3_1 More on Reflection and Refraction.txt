Let's continue our talk. Just a few extra things I want to mention on refraction.
Now what we have here is our surface of interface, so two of them.
So perpendicular to that surface we will have the normal and we always measure the angle of incidence,
reflection and refraction as between a light ray and the normal, not between the surface and the light ray.
When we do these problems we will probably, it will be mentioned most of the time that we are talking about monochromatic light.
In other words, light at one wavelength because n, we will remember our absolute index of refraction, depends on the wavelength.
And we mentioned before that the shorter wavelengths will have more refraction.
I've drawn these lighter lines on this side just so that we can see that we are dealing with, say for instance this is air, so our n will be one.
And just these lines to show that the n will be more here, so this will be glass or water or any transparent material.
Let's just make some enough. We say that this is 1.1 and then this is going to be n equals 1.1.
So if the light ray comes in on this side, this makes an incident that is n i and this is where it gets transmitted through and becomes t.
Here, this will be n i and this will be n t.
So n i is 1 but n i is 1.1.
So here we are going from a lower to a higher.
This is the incident light.
So that's the incident light coming in there.
This will be our incident angle.
And because we are going from lower to higher, that means this angle is going to get smaller.
So this angle theta t is going to be smaller.
And remember some of it gets reflected and that will be at exactly the same angle theta i.
The magnitude of that angle is going to be exactly the same.
So this bends towards.
So we are going in this direction.
What I do want to mention here is there is no incident light ray that I can do, that I can point at this line of interface that will make this refracted ray go beyond the normal.
It cannot go beyond the normal.
Please remember that.
So even if I make the incident light, incident ray up here, this incident ray, I'm still going to go towards normal but it cannot.
It cannot go beyond the normal.
For that obviously I will have to have my incident light go beyond the normal.
Okay, so that's not going to happen.
And even if I do this, even if I do this, I'm going to bend slightly towards, still towards the normal.
But there's no way that I can get total external, total external reflection under these circumstances.
Okay, because I'm going from lower to higher.
If this incident was 1.1, and this was lower, we can get to reflection, total internal reflection.
Let's have a look at that.
So here I have going from higher to lower.
In other words, if I do this, higher to lower, so my incident angle there, I am bending away from the norm.
So my refracted angle there is going to be larger.
It's going to be larger.
And you can well imagine, Yen is going to be there.
You can well imagine that there is going to be an angle, there is going to be an angle in which I am now going to get total internal,
we will get total internal reflection, that I then go beyond this surface here.
But now this angle, this whole angle, and that whole angle will be exactly the same.
Now we are talking about reflection, not refraction.
And for the law of reflection, this states that theta of my incident is going to be theta prime incident.
In other words, this whole angle is going to equal that whole angle.
And then there is the law of refraction, law of refraction.
And that is Snell's law.
I think in the previous few years I wrote that the two L's, most, many textbooks have two L's, but apparently Snell himself,
spelled its own surname with only one half, so we'll leave it at that.
The absolute refractive index of the incident material times the sine of that incident angle equals N.
The absolute refractive index of the material through which the refractive ray passes times that angle of the refractive ray.
And this is for monochromatic, please remember this is for monochromatic light.
Now here we have a very good problem.
We have this prism, and we shine light in.
Imagine that the air outside has an absolute refractive index of one.
We shine light in, and we note that on that surface there is total internal reflection.
Total internal reflection, there's the normal.
And we measure this, and we see that it is 45 degrees.
This incident angle is 45 degrees.
So the angle of incident here is 45 degrees.
Now we want to know what does this tell us about the refractive index, absolute refractive index of this material.
And also I want to know something about the critical angle.
Is the critical angle, can it be less than 45 degrees, can it be more than 45 degrees?
The way that this question is asked, though, usually will be something like this.
It says, a triangular prism of glass in air, an incident ray enters the glass perpendicular to one face,
and is strictly reflected at the far glass air interface as indicated.
If the incident angle is 45 degrees, what can you say about the index of refraction in of the glass?
Well, let's just do, let's just do this as it stands, and we make it, and we make it a critical angle.
So that it's going to be in T divided by in I.
Now, this is in T, because we're in the glass, so our incidence is in the glass, and the refractive would have been outside.
So this is air is in T, we want to know in I.
So in I is going to equal in T divided by the sign of our choosing this 45,
because clearly there is double internal reflection there of 45 degrees.
And NT is 1.
So NI equals 1 over the sign of 45 degrees.
And what does that equal to? 1.4. Let's do that.
1 over the sign of 45, that gives us square root of 2, which is 1.414.
So if this is our critical angle, if this is our critical angle, we can say that the absolute refractive index of our material equals 1.41.
Now, just think about it.
Just let me leave it here, because I'm going to leave it again.
Let's think about that.
Now, again, that absolute refractive index, for this physically to happen, we've done this experiment, this is happening.
Can this refractive index be higher than that?
So let's take n incidence as equal to 1.5.
1.5.
Is that possible?
So at that of 1.5, let's check what the critical angle is going to be.
The critical angle is going to be the arc sine of NT divided by NI.
So that is going to be the arc sine of NT.
It's called 1 over 1.5.
So let's do the arc sine of 1 over 1.5.
So that gives us an angle of 41.8 degrees.
That equals 41.8 degrees.
So if my refractive index goes higher than 1.44, because I'm asking the question, I must say something about this refractive index.
Is this the minimum that it can be?
Or is this the maximum that it can be to give me this physical reality?
I've done this experiment and it happens.
And it shows me that if I increase it, my critical angle is now 41.8 degrees.
And if I go higher than my critical angle, I get total internal reflection.
And here indeed, 45 is higher than 41 and I'm getting total internal reflection.
That says to me that this is the minimum absolute refractive index I can be dealing with.
Because let's make NI, let's make that 1.3.
So then my critical angle is going to be the arc sine of 1 over 1.3.
And that equals, let's do that, the arc sine of 1 over 1.3.
That equals 50.3 degrees.
That equals 50.3 degrees.
And I can only get total internal reflection if my incident angle is larger than my critical angle.
So for total internal reflection of a material now with an index of 1.3, a refractive index of 1.3,
I get an angle of larger than 50.3 degrees to give me total internal reflection.
And I'm already getting total internal reflection at 45 degrees.
That means that I can't have an absolute index of reflection of less than 1.414.
If I do that, I say like C, at 45, I'm not going to get total internal reflection.
Okay.
So it says, what this says to me is that the absolute refractive index of this glass has got
to be more than equal to the square root of, no, the square root of 2, 1.414.
So that's the minimum, the refractive, that is the minimum I should,
index of reflection I can deal with to get this setup of total internal reflection.
So it should probably be more than, more than that, that's our minimum.
Okay.
But at 500, we don't expect a tremendous amount of all right.
And we've driven superbiotics when all right away comes as vegetable lights.
Then we come back and keep pushing us forward to causing you.
Thank you very much.
So that is, you know, the depth what the beauty is and make it easier.
And then you get the profund ฤรณ like as well.
That's the way we do, the depth how we can build it,
