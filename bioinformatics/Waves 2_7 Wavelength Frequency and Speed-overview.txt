The text describes solving a physics problem involving wave motion on a string with given parameters. The process begins by converting units to the International System (SI) for consistency: mass per unit length from grams per centimeter to kilograms per meter, resulting in 0.50 kg/m. The tension is already provided as 10 newtons, which is in SI units.

The wave has an amplitude of 0.12 millimeters, converted to meters (0.00012 m), and a frequency of 100 hertz traveling in the negative x-direction. From this information:

1. **Amplitude (y-max)**: Given directly as 0.12 mm or 0.00012 meters.

2. **Angular wave number (k)**: Derived using \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \), where \( \lambda \) (wavelength) can be expressed as \( v/f \). The velocity \( v \) is found from \( v = \sqrt{\tau/\mu} \), with tension (\(\tau\)) of 10 N and linear density (\(\mu\)) of 0.50 kg/m. This gives:
   \[
   v = \sqrt{10/0.50} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.47 \, \text{m/s}
   \]
   Thus, \( \lambda = v/f = 4.47/100 = 0.0447 \, \text{m} \), and
   \[
   k = \frac{2\pi}{0.0447} \approx 140.6 \, \text{m}^{-1}
   \]

3. **Angular frequency (\(\omega\))**: Calculated as \( \omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \times 100 = 200\pi \, \text{rad/s} \).

The wave equation will have a positive sign in front of \(\omega\) because the wave travels in the negative x-direction. The text emphasizes using these fundamental equations for solving wave problems and memorizing them for efficiency.
