In this video we're going to look at Stokes' Theorem.
Now, I have, from what I've read,
Stokes did not originally
state this theorem, it was actually stated by Lord Calvin,
who mentioned this to Stokes, who then set this as
a question in a test at Cambridge, and asked the students
to prove this theorem, and it's not known whether any of the students
could prove this. Now, it's also called
Green's Theorem in 3-space. Where we've just done Green's Theorem, where we looked
in the plane, we also now have to look in 3-dimensional
space, and how can we
evaluate the closed line integral
as far as vector f dot
dr with vector r, how we can
relate that to
a double integral.
And where we had a normal double
integral with Green's Theorem,
we're now going to have a surface integral.
And there in green
you see the equation that you should
memorize. So, f dot dr,
the
closed curve
integral of that,
equals this double surface integral
of the curl of vector f dot
product with the normal vector
to some surface
with respect to that surface.
Now, let's have a look at
all the steps that we need.
And it's actually beautiful to do Green's Theorem,
then Stokes' Theorem, and then Gauss' Theorem
because it just brings together all
that you have learned, or should have learned
in multivariable calculus.
So, first of all,
if we have a function f,
which is a vector function,
yeah, in x, y, and z.
So, let's just give that some components
m, n, and p, just to remind ourselves
of how do we get the curl of f.
Well, that's just the determinant
of this 3x3 matrix,
where you put i hat, j hat, k hat
on the top in the first row,
and I put the negative there,
just to remind ourselves
when you do this determinant
that you remember to put the negative there.
Then the del operator,
so that's di, di x, di, di y, di, di z,
and then m, n, and p,
the components of the vector function f.
And that's how you do the curl.
That's one way to do the curl.
Now, what does this refer to?
What does Stokes' Theorem refer to?
Let's just look at the figure
on the right hand side.
surface S,
and that surface is now intersected
by some plane, a curve,
a plane curve in a 3-space,
and where they intersect,
obviously a line will form,
and that is the curve,
the line of the curve
over which we're going to take this integral.
And you'll also note there
a normal vector to the surface,
and this graph just illustrates the direction
of this normal vector,
because the vector could also point
pi radians in the other direction.
And what we use is the right hand rule,
so if we curl the fingers of our right hand
along this curve,
along the path of this curve,
our thumb points up,
and that means that normal vector
will have to point upwards.
Now, just to remind ourselves,
we have the curl of F.
We now know how to do that.
We have to do the dot product
with the normal vector to the surface.
And how do we do that?
Well, if we were given this surface
as Z equals the G of X and Y,
we're going to construct a new function,
uppercase G in X, Y, and Z.
We're going to let that equal to Z minus,
and that Z is just Z.
You just write down the letter Z,
minus whatever you were given for Z,
in other words, the G of X and Y.
If you take the gradient of this uppercase G function
and you divide it by the norm of the gradient
of that function,
you would get the normal vector.
In other words, it's a unit length one
pointing perpendicularly away from the surface.
To remind ourselves what happens to the DS,
so we know now how to do curl of F.
We remember how to do this normal vector.
And now just what to do with DS
as far as surface integrals are concerned.
So we have to look back at surface integrals.
Now, if our surface was given as Z equals to G of X and Y,
DS was just going to be the square root of
di Z di X squared plus di Z di Y squared plus di Z di Z squared,
which is just one DA.
And that is how I bring the surface down to the XY plane
because when we set up this double integral,
because it's the double integral over that surface,
with respect to that surface,
we have to bring that down into a double integral,
in other words, to the XY plane
so that we can put lower and upper values
for the two definite integrals there
and that I have to do in the XY plane.
And I can either then do type 1 and type 2 region
or convert it to polar coordinates.
If I was given this plane not as a Z equals the G of X and Y,
but Y equals the G of X and Z,
you see how to do that.
So dy dy would be 1 in the middle
and the same if I was given the function
in the form X equals the G of Y and Z,
the di X di X squared becomes 1.
So we've reviewed everything we require to do Stokes' theorem
and it's nothing other than Green's theorem
bumped up to another dimension.
We're now in 3 space.
