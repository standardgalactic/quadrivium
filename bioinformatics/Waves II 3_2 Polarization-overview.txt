To solve these problems involving polarized light passing through multiple polarizers, we need to apply Malus's Law and some basic principles regarding unpolarized light.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Unpolarized Light**: When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, its intensity is reduced by half. This is because only the component of the electric field aligned with the polarizer’s axis is transmitted.

2. **Malus's Law**: After passing through an ideal polarizer, if the light then encounters another polarizer at an angle \(\theta\) to the first one, the transmitted intensity \(I\) is given by:
   \[
   I = I_0 \cos^2(\theta)
   \]
   where \(I_0\) is the intensity of the light just before the second polarizer.

3. **Electric Field Amplitude**: The relationship between intensity and electric field amplitude (\(E_m\)) in free space is:
   \[
   I = \frac{E_m^2}{2 c \mu_0}
   \]
   where \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space.

4. **Pressure Due to Absorbed Light**: For perfectly absorbing surfaces, the radiation pressure \(P\) due to absorbed light can be expressed as:
   \[
   P = \frac{I}{c}
   \]
   where \(I\) is the intensity of the incident light on the surface.

### Step-by-Step Solutions:

1. **First Problem: Unpolarized Light Through Three Polarizers**:
    - **Initial Intensity**: Let's denote it as \(I_0\).
    - **After First Polarizer**: The intensity becomes \(\frac{I_0}{2}\) because the light is unpolarized initially.
    - **Second Polarizer at 50° to Horizontal**:
      - Angle with first polarizer: 40° (since both make an angle of 50° with the horizontal, the internal angle between them is \( |50^\circ - (-50^\circ)| = 100^\circ \), but we take the smaller angle, i.e., \(80^\circ\)).
      - Intensity after second polarizer: 
        \[
        I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cos^2(40^\circ)
        \]
    - **Third Polarizer at 50° to Vertical (or -50° to Horizontal)**:
      - Angle with second polarizer again results in \(80^\circ\) (since it is also 50° from the horizontal, but in the opposite direction).
      - Intensity after third polarizer:
        \[
        I_3 = I_2 \cos^2(40^\circ) = \left(\frac{I_0}{2} \cos^2(40^\circ)\right) \cos^2(40^\circ)
        \]
      - Simplifying gives:
        \[
        I_3 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cos^4(40^\circ)
        \]

2. **Electric Field Amplitude**:
    - Given initial intensity \(I_0 = 10\) mW/m².
    - Intensity after the first polarizer: 
      \[
      I = \frac{I_0}{2} = 5 \text{ mW/m}^2
      \]
    - Using the formula for electric field amplitude:
      \[
      E_m = \sqrt{2 I c \mu_0}
      \]
    - Plugging in \(I = 5 \times 10^{-3}\) W/m², \(c = 3 \times 10^8\) m/s, and \(\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\) N/A²:
      \[
      E_m = \sqrt{2 \times 5 \times 10^{-3} \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 4\pi \times 10^{-7}}
      \]
    - Calculating gives \(E_m \approx 1.9\) V/m.

3. **Pressure on the Filter**:
    - Using intensity after first polarizer: \(I = 5 \text{ mW/m}^2\).
    - Pressure due to absorbed light:
      \[
      P = \frac{I}{c} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-3}}{3 \times 10^8}
      \]
    - Calculating gives \(P \approx 17\) picopascal.

These calculations illustrate how the intensity and other properties of light change as it passes through polarizers, using basic principles from optics.
