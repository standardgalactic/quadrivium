The text describes three key properties of binary relations: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 

1. **Reflexive Property**: A relation on a set \(A\) is reflexive if every element relates to itself. Examples include the "divides" relation among numbers (each number divides itself) and the "greater than or equal to" relation among real numbers.

2. **Symmetric Property**: A relation is symmetric if, for any elements \(A\) and \(B\), whenever \(A\) relates to \(B\), then \(B\) also relates to \(A\). The text advises caution with the direction of relations in educational contexts, as it can vary.

3. **Transitive Property**: A relation is transitive if, for any elements where one relates to a second and the second relates to a third, the first element must relate to the third. An example is the "parallel" relation among lines: if line one is parallel to line two, and line two is parallel to line three, then line one is parallel to line three.

These properties are fundamental for understanding binary relations in mathematics.
