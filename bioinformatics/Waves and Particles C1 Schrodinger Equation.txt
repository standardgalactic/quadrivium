Now we're going to get to the Schrodinger equation.
Now it is quite complex.
It contains complex numbers, imaginary numbers.
And it is very difficult to understand. It might not make a lot of
sense now. But we have to, let's just push through it, that you have some
understanding of probability. And that is where we
took a matter wave and
electrons form a pattern
of interference. And we said if we took a smaller little detector
up and down there, there will be a likelihood that the electron strikes there,
lower likelihood there, higher likelihood there, lower likelihood as we go through from the
bright to the dark fringes. So if we talked about a wave
in a medium, we used Newtonian equations and we said any
function in the form kx plus minus
omega t and that f was
sine function or cosine function
that described the wave force and that
was pure Newtonian equations.
Then we came to an
electromagnetic wave,
a light wave or
ultraviolet wave or radio wave
and it is
described by four
Maxwell equations.
And what we have in essence,
if we look at the electric field
component of it, it's
a function that is
a vector, so it has magnitude and direction
and as much as the directions
in three dimensions, x, y and z
and also dependent on the time variable.
And an electromagnetic wave carries with it energy
and momentum.
Energy and momentum.
Now a matter wave, you can think to yourself
it's going to be more complex
because not only do I have to,
it has to not only carry energy and momentum
but mass as well.
Mass as well.
So this is the sort of thing that we're dealing with.
This,
that I have a little line underneath
is the capital Greek letter
psi.
So this matter wave
which we now see is a
probability wave
and it is a function also
of three dimensional space
and the fourth dimension time
and it has two components.
This first component that's psi,
Greek psi but a lowercase.
So we'll have two components.
This is the spatial component.
Space component
and this is the time component
of it.
Now this space component
I want to warn you now
is a complex number,
complex function that contains
I and we know we define
I squared to be negative one.
So I is the square root
of negative one.
And that does not make any sense
any sense to us,
any physical sense.
So just warning you now
we use the absolute value
of psi squared
and that actually is psi
times its conjugate
and you get the conjugate
by multiplying any I
with negative one.
So any I becomes negative I
so negative times negative one
makes it a positive.
makes it a positive.
So you get its value
but an absolute value
of that and you square it.
Okay? And this is how we do it.
It's psi times its conjugate
and the conjugate is just
replacing any I with a negative I.
Okay?
and what this lowercase
psi describes for us is what we call
um
a probability density
probability density
and um
the way that I wanted to
describe it is
is that um
um
there is something I wanted to
wait that I wanted to describe
anyway
let's do it that way
that this probability density
so we use this in the equation
but we are always going to express it in this format
because it makes sense to us
there's no complex number in it
there's no square root of negative one in it
it's always positive
it describes for us
the probability
that a particle
will be found in a small volume
centered around the specific spot
so
y and z
so it's just
dimension
there's no time
component
so on a spot
a small volume around that spot
is the probability of finding
the wave
finding the particle
in that little volume
centered around that spot
that is the probability density
that's what that means
that is what that means
so in the next video
I'm going to give you
Schrodinger's equation
and we'll carry on from there
now we're going to give you
Schrodinger's equation
but I'm going to simplify it
and my particle moves only in the x direction
we're not going to have y and z components
and here it comes
the second derivative
of my space variable
with respect to the x direction
in the second derivative
okay
plus
we're going to have
8 pi squared
times the mass
of my particle
divided by h squared
times
the total mechanical energy
minus potential energy
times again
so
I have this function
in its second derivative
there
equals
zero
now
what is the potential energy
I've just said
we're only moving our particle
in the x direction
and
if there are net forces
acting on it
that net
those net forces
will give
that particle
a potential energy
so
let's simplify this
even further
we're taking
simplified
conditions
not only are we
only going to move
in the x direction
we have no net force
on our particle
so it's a free moving particle
no net force
acts upon it
so
the potential energy
goes to zero
and since
mechanical energy
so mechanical energy
is kinetic energy
and the potential energy
the potential energy part
is now zero
we're only talking about
its kinetic energy
now it only has
kinetic energy
we're also going to
deal with it
non-relativistically
in other words
all we have in there
is half mv squared
so under these idealized
circumstances
we're going to have
di squared
psi
di x squared
plus
we're going to have
8y squared
times the mass
divided by h squared
and here I'm going to
have a half mv squared
and that's going to
equal zero
so let's simplify that
I'm going to have
d squared psi
divided by dx squared
and now I'm going to have
h divided by 2
that leaves me 4
I think they write 4
as 2 squared
I'm going to have
pi squared
I'm going to have
mass squared
I'm going to have
v squared
I'm going to have
h squared
and then I'm going to
have psi equals zero
zero
so I'm going to have
then psi equals
um
psi equals zero
now from here
I'm going to
I'm going to look
on my cheat board
I'm going to remember
that
that momentum equals
non-relativistically
mass times volume
and I certainly
have mass times
velocity
I certainly have
mass times velocity
there
so we have
d squared psi over
dx squared
plus I'm going to
have 2 squared
pi squared
and I'm going to
have p squared
divided by h squared
psi equals zero
I do remember
my de Broglie
wave function
wavelength though
and that states that
lambda equals
h over p
but I have
p over h there
in other words
I'm going to have
1 over lambda
equals p over h
so this makes it
d squared psi
with respect to
dx squared
and
for those two
I'm going to
replace that with
1 over lambda
which is going to
give me
2
pi squared
over lambda squared
2 squared
so I can just write
that whole thing
as
2 pi over lambda
all squared
psi equals zero
now I remember
something way back
as much as I have
an angular wave number
k
which is 2 pi over lambda
which is in there
so that's d squared
over dx squared
plus k squared
psi
equals zero
so this is a very simplified
and as much as there's no
net external force
so it's a free particle
moving only in the x direction
so this is an idealized form of
and the very special circumstances
of the Schrodinger equation
we're going to take this further
we're going to take this further
in the next video
good
so under these special circumstances
only in the x direction
no net external force
free particle
I have that equation
now that is a differential equation
and as much as we have there
we have a function
and its second derivative
not only first derivative
but second derivative
and I'm going to tell you
without getting into the mathematics
of that
that this is the most general solution
where a and b are arbitrary constants
ok so
let's start here
back to where we started
now we're only going to do this
in x and t
it's going to equal
here's my most general solution now
i k x
plus b
negative i k x
that's that part
and I'm multiplying it by
e to the power negative i omega t
i omega t
now
we can certainly multiply this out
let's do that
sine x of t
now we're going to be
e to the power e
so I'm going to have
i k x minus
i omega t
that must make a lot of sense to you
so we are talking about waves here
plus b
e to the power
now I've got a minus and a minus
which will leave me
a minus i as a common factor
I'm going to have k x plus omega t
and if you remember way back to our functions
this will indicate that moving in the positive x direction
and k x plus omega t means it's going to move into the negative x direction
so let's simplify things again
I'm only looking at a particle moving freely in the positive x direction
so I will let this be zero
I will let that be zero
and let's just change things a bit
I'm also going to call this psi zero
so because I'm only looking at it in one direction
okay I'm only looking at psi not psi capital
just an x and t
just an x and t
okay let's call that psi zero
psi zero
e to the power i
k x minus omega t
k x minus omega t
but this is not what we want
this is not what we want
we want what we want
we want to end up with
remember what I told you here
the psi absolute value of that square
because that will have physical meaning for us
what that means
I'm going to multiply this
by its conjugate
so I'm going to get psi
actually in this one x then
is going to be
psi zero
e to the power i
k x minus omega t
and I'm multiplying that by psi zero
e to the power of kpi
I make a minus
I make a minus i
k x minus omega t
so here I'm going to have psi zero squared
and I'm going to have e to the power of that
minus that
means e to the power of zero
and e to the power of zero is one
is one
so this is this squared now
right
ok so I'm left with
the probability density
the chance that I find
in x squared is that
the chance that I find a particle on the x axis
the probability that I find that is this
which is a constant
so if I have an x y coordinate system there
an x y coordinate system there
and this is
this is
this is
psi squared by probability density
by probability density
and
it is equal to a constant
so I'm going to have this line carry on
from infinity to negative infinity
because this is y equals a constant
what I'm trying to say
meaning that this particle of line
under these circumstances
is equally probable to be found
anywhere from negative infinity to positive infinity
on this x axis
some of this mathematics will make sense to you
where we do the simple algebra
and that sort of thing
and some won't make a lot of sense to you
because here I'm just taking the general solution
to this differential equation
which we won't go into
but certainly the rest should make sense
and what must make absolute physical sense
or what you have to take from this
is that we are dealing with this square
that's the dense probability density
which you have to take
you have to get by multiplying this function
by its conjugate
when the conjugate is changing any
complex number i
this complex number i
this imaginary number i
to negative i
which will leave you e to the power of zero
which is just a one
