Let's continue with this problem, we're just going to get this line integral with respect to y
so what we need here is dy dt
dy dt is going to equal, dy is going to equal
is that 2t plus 1, was that right?
2t plus 1, so that is just going to equal 2
2 times dt
2 times dt, so we're going to have the integral again from 0 to 1
we're going to have this 2t squared plus 2
plus t, and for dy we're going to have 2 times dt
2 is a constant, we can bring that down, dt
and that is just going to equal 2 times
this is all the same as before, so this is going to be 2 times 7 over 6
and that equals 7 over 3
