The text introduces the concept of flux in a two-dimensional coordinate system, beginning with a review of the line integral, previously discussed as work done by a force over a distance (force times distance). In the context of physics, it was expressed using a dot product between a vector field \( f \) and a differential path element \( dr \), highlighting that \( f \) represents force while \( dr \) gives direction along a path.

The text then transitions from thinking of the vector field as representing force to considering it as a velocity field in a fluid context. Here, flux is not about work but about measuring how much of a fluid (considered either a gas or liquid) passes through a given line over time. The key difference lies in the directionality: instead of the component of \( f \) along the path (\( dr \)), we are interested in the component perpendicular to it.

This perpendicular component is captured by a normal vector \( n \), which, for convenience and convention, points to the right relative to \( dr \). The flux through a line segment is then described using a line integral of the form \( f \cdot n \, ds \), where \( ds \) represents an infinitesimal length of the curve, and \( n \) gives direction perpendicular to this element. 

In essence, flux quantifies how much fluid flows across a line within a given time interval, visualized as the volume of fluid passing through the line over that period. This approach is useful in understanding physical phenomena like fluid flow and can be generalized from two dimensions to multivariable functions for broader applications.

The text describes the concept of flux in vector calculus, particularly in the context of fluid dynamics. It explains how to find the component of a vector field (such as velocity) along a perpendicular unit vector to a line segment. This is done using the dot product between the flow vector and the normal (perpendicular) unit vector. The result represents the area of a parallelogram formed by these vectors, which corresponds to the amount of fluid passing through the line segment over time.

Flux can also be extended from lines to surfaces in three-dimensional space. When considering a surface such as a sphere, flux is calculated as the integral of the dot product between the vector field and the normal vector at each point on the surface. This represents the volume of fluid passing through the entire surface over an infinitesimal time period.

The text emphasizes that these calculations involve surface integrals, which are a common method for determining three-dimensional flux across surfaces in vector fields. The examples given include closed surfaces like spheres as well as open ones, illustrating how to apply this concept to different geometric shapes.
