The text outlines a mathematical approach using Feynman's technique—differentiating under the integral sign—to solve the challenging definite integral of \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x} \, dx\). Here’s a concise summary:

1. **Problem Overview**: The integral \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x} \, dx\) is difficult due to singularity at \(x = 0\).

2. **Introducing an Auxiliary Parameter**: A parameter \(b\) is introduced into the integrand to form \(\int_0^\infty e^{-bx} \frac{\sin x}{x} \, dx\). Setting \(b = 0\) recovers the original integral.

3. **Differentiation with Respect to \(b\)**: Differentiating under the integral sign using Leibniz's rule gives:
   \[
   -\int_0^\infty e^{-bx} \sin x \, dx
   \]

4. **Integration by Parts**: This new integral is simplified via integration by parts, leading to a recursive relation.

5. **Solving the Recurrence**: Solving this recurrence helps express the original problem in simpler terms or known results.

6. **Evaluation at \(b = 0\)**: Evaluating the expression as \(b\) approaches zero gives the value of the original integral.

7. **Solution Verification and Calculation**: The solution involves expressing the integral as \(-\arctan(b) + \pi/2\). Setting \(b = 0\), we find:
   \[
   i(0) = -\arctan(0) + \pi/2 = \pi/2
   \]

8. **Conclusion**: The definite integral from 0 to infinity of \(\sin(x)/x\) is \(\pi/2\). This elegant solution showcases the power and beauty of Feynman's technique in transforming complex integrals into manageable forms.
