The text describes the discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Frisch and his colleagues in 1939, which marked the beginning of the nuclear age. Nuclear fission involves an incident neutron being absorbed by uranium-235, creating an unstable compound nucleus that splits into smaller nuclei (e.g., barium-141, krypton-92) along with additional neutrons. This process releases significant energy—about 200 MeV per fission event—far exceeding chemical reactions like combustion.

The text explains how nuclear fission can lead to a chain reaction. In a controlled environment like a nuclear reactor, this reaction is managed to provide steady power generation. Conversely, in nuclear weapons, an uncontrolled rapid chain reaction results in explosive energy release. Thermal neutrons are crucial for efficient neutron capture by fissile materials such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239.

Controlled fission in reactors involves using materials like graphite to slow down neutrons, ensuring a sustainable chain reaction where each fission event produces more than one neutron on average. The text also highlights the importance of binding energy: for energy to be released during fission, daughter nuclei must have higher binding energy per nucleon than the original nucleus.

In summary, nuclear fission has both destructive and beneficial applications—powering weapons and providing energy in power plants—and relies on controlling neutron interactions to sustain a chain reaction. Energy release is tied to the production of daughter nuclei with greater binding energy.
