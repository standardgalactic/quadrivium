I just want to take this opportunity to wish all the students the best of luck for 2018.
At least here in the Southern Hemisphere and South Africa, we start a new academic year beginning January, February.
So especially for the students coming to do their surgical reputation with us, please come and enjoy it.
Now over the Christmas holidays, I've been working on a new topic, how to master working with a blade.
This is what you have to look forward to.
