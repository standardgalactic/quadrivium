The text outlines a method for finding the equation of a tangent plane to the function \( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) at the point \( p = (1, 1, -1) \) in three-dimensional space. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Evaluate the Function:** Calculate \( f(1, 1, -1) = 3 \).

2. **Compute the Difference Vector:** For any vector \( x = (x, y, z) \), find \( x - p = (x-1, y-1, z+1) \).

3. **Determine the Gradient:** The gradient of \( f \) is \( \nabla f(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z) \). At point \( p \), it becomes \( \nabla f(1, 1, -1) = (2, 2, -2) \).

4. **Formulate the Tangent Plane Equation:** Use the formula for the tangent plane:
   \[
   t(x, y, z) = f(p) + \nabla f(p) \cdot ((x, y, z) - p)
   \]
   Substitute to get:
   \[
   t(x, y, z) = 3 + (2, 2, -2) \cdot (x-1, y-1, z+1)
   \]
   Simplify the dot product and expression:
   \[
   t(x, y, z) = 3 + (2x - 2 + 2y - 2 - 2z - 2) = 2x + 2y - 2z - 3
   \]

5. **Verify Tangency:** Confirm the plane is tangent by checking:
   \[
   \lim_{(x, y, z) \to (1, 1, -1)} \frac{f(x, y, z) - t(x, y, z)}{\|(x, y, z) - p\|} = 0
   \]
   This ensures the plane is correctly tangent at \( p \).

The final equation of the tangent plane is:
\[ 
2x + 2y - 2z - 3 = 0 
\]

The process involves algebraic manipulation and evaluating limits to ensure the plane's tangency. The text also touches on simplifying expressions and using geometric interpretations in higher dimensions, although it primarily focuses on three-dimensional space for this example.
