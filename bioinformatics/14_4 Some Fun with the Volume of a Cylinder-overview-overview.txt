The text provides a method to calculate the volume of a cylinder using double integrals in calculus. Here's a summarized overview:

1. **Geometry**: A cylinder is defined by its circular base with radius \(a\) and height \(h\). The base equation is \(x^2 + y^2 = a^2\).

2. **Integral Setup**:
   - Integrate over the region where \(y\) ranges from 0 to \(\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\) and \(x\) from 0 to \(a\).
   - Construct an iterated double integral first with respect to \(y\), treating height (\(h\)) as a constant.

3. **Integration Process**:
   - Perform the inner integration over \(y\).
   - Use trigonometric substitution for the outer integral, setting \(x = a \sin(\theta)\), which changes \(\theta\) limits from 0 to \(\pi/2\).

4. **Simplification**:
   - Apply trigonometric identities like \(1 - \sin^2(\theta) = \cos^2(\theta)\).
   - Use half-angle formulas for integrating \(\cos^2(\theta)\).

5. **Final Volume Calculation**:
   - Complete the integration to find the volume, incorporating the height (\(h\)).
   - Since only a quarter of the base is considered initially, multiply the result by 4.
   - This leads to the formula \(h a^2 \pi\), which simplifies to \(\pi r^2 h\) (where \(r = a\)), the standard volume formula for a cylinder.

The text also notes that similar techniques can be applied to find volumes of other shapes, like spheres, using double integrals.
